1
00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.660
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on to another trait.</v>

2
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.063
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

3
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.850
<v Speaker 1>we talked about extroversion and</v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism and I basically laid out the</v>

4
00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:22.851
<v Speaker 1>case for you that extroverted people</v>
<v Speaker 1>were more sensitive to incentive reward</v>

5
00:00:22.921 --> 00:00:26.580
<v Speaker 1>and people who are high in neuroticism</v>
<v Speaker 1>more and more sensitive to anxiety on to</v>

6
00:00:26.581 --> 00:00:31.581
<v Speaker 1>emotional pain and that there are</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental biological subsystems</v>

7
00:00:31.801 --> 00:00:35.430
<v Speaker 1>associated with those dimensions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that it's not a single dimension,</v>

8
00:00:35.431 --> 00:00:38.760
<v Speaker 1>which is also a very important thing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>note because people tend to think of</v>

9
00:00:38.761 --> 00:00:41.460
<v Speaker 1>happy as the opposite of sad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

10
00:00:41.461 --> 00:00:42.420
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

11
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.720
<v Speaker 1>it's not because you can be happy or not</v>
<v Speaker 1>happy and you can be sad or not sad.</v>

12
00:00:49.111 --> 00:00:53.100
<v Speaker 1>And I suppose if you're really sad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not happy and sad at the same</v>

13
00:00:53.101 --> 00:00:53.611
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

14
00:00:53.611 --> 00:00:55.380
<v Speaker 1>So that would mean that you'd be an</v>
<v Speaker 1>introverted,</v>

15
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.200
<v Speaker 1>somebody who's high in neuroticism and</v>
<v Speaker 1>high and introversion.</v>

16
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.180
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

17
00:01:00.181 --> 00:01:03.690
<v Speaker 1>you're not very enthusiastic under those</v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances and you're quite sensitive</v>

18
00:01:03.691 --> 00:01:04.530
<v Speaker 1>to negative emotions.</v>

19
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.050
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

20
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.940
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just how it goes.</v>

21
00:01:10.941 --> 00:01:13.190
<v Speaker 1>And now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the traits,</v>

22
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.230
<v Speaker 1>you might think that in some sense you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could score high on a trade and low on a</v>

23
00:01:18.231 --> 00:01:20.720
<v Speaker 1>trade in that maybe high would be better</v>
<v Speaker 1>than low.</v>

24
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.520
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very complicated.</v>

25
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically what you have to assume is</v>

26
00:01:25.641 --> 00:01:27.620
<v Speaker 1>that the traits are now normally</v>
<v Speaker 1>distributed.</v>

27
00:01:27.621 --> 00:01:31.160
<v Speaker 1>I think I have a normal distribute here</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a normal distribution here.</v>

28
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.840
<v Speaker 1>And also that there's an average,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people cluster around the average</v>

29
00:01:35.841 --> 00:01:36.980
<v Speaker 1>and then there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

30
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.670
<v Speaker 1>increasingly few people as you move</v>
<v Speaker 1>farther and farther to the extremes.</v>

31
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.200
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason that there's normal</v>

32
00:01:42.201 --> 00:01:46.250
<v Speaker 1>distribution is because there are</v>
<v Speaker 1>adaptive advantages.</v>

33
00:01:46.251 --> 00:01:50.780
<v Speaker 1>Speaking from a biological perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are adaptive advantages to every</v>

34
00:01:50.781 --> 00:01:53.870
<v Speaker 1>position on that distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might say,</v>

35
00:01:53.871 --> 00:01:56.060
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the use of being extremely</v>

36
00:01:56.061 --> 00:01:58.910
<v Speaker 1>anxious and easily hurt?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that might be,</v>

37
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.410
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's complicated,</v>

38
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.740
<v Speaker 1>but some potential answers might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

39
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.350
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not clear how sensitive you should</v>

40
00:02:06.351 --> 00:02:10.130
<v Speaker 1>be to distress if you're going to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>good caretaker of small infants,</v>

41
00:02:10.131 --> 00:02:10.964
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

42
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.840
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that's a relevant issue</v>
<v Speaker 1>because women tend to be higher in trait</v>

43
00:02:14.841 --> 00:02:17.690
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism than men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about half a standard deviation</v>

44
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.940
<v Speaker 1>that occurs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interestingly enough,</v>

45
00:02:19.941 --> 00:02:23.710
<v Speaker 1>pretty much right at puberty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at boys and girls before,</v>

46
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.760
<v Speaker 1>before puberty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not much difference in</v>

47
00:02:25.761 --> 00:02:28.610
<v Speaker 1>sensitivity to negative emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There seems to be a hormonal</v>

48
00:02:28.611 --> 00:02:31.550
<v Speaker 1>transformation and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

49
00:02:31.551 --> 00:02:35.450
<v Speaker 1>we don't know exactly why that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although we do know that it manifests</v>

50
00:02:35.451 --> 00:02:37.310
<v Speaker 1>itself in a couple of different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>

51
00:02:37.311 --> 00:02:41.450
<v Speaker 1>it never goes away after that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So women and men never equalize again in</v>

52
00:02:41.451 --> 00:02:43.490
<v Speaker 1>terms of their sensitivity to negative</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion.</v>

53
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.230
<v Speaker 1>Second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

54
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.710
<v Speaker 1>it's true cross-culturally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much wherever you look.</v>

55
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.060
<v Speaker 1>And we'll talk about the cross cultural</v>
<v Speaker 1>findings a little bit in more detail</v>

56
00:02:53.061 --> 00:02:55.610
<v Speaker 1>today because they're quite interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And third,</v>

57
00:02:55.611 --> 00:02:59.950
<v Speaker 1>it's also in keeping with the clinical</v>
<v Speaker 1>findings that women are much more to</v>

58
00:02:59.951 --> 00:03:02.650
<v Speaker 1>both depression and anxiety from a</v>
<v Speaker 1>clinical perspective.</v>

59
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.810
<v Speaker 1>So maybe three to four times a</v>
<v Speaker 1>susceptible.</v>

60
00:03:04.811 --> 00:03:06.730
<v Speaker 1>It depends on how you measure it</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously.</v>

61
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.430
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of converging evidence</v>

62
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.500
<v Speaker 1>that suggest that and then well</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the only gender differences.</v>

63
00:03:17.111 --> 00:03:19.600
<v Speaker 1>The other big gender differences in is</v>
<v Speaker 1>in agreeableness.</v>

64
00:03:19.601 --> 00:03:21.340
<v Speaker 1>And that's the trick we're going to talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about today.</v>

65
00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.010
<v Speaker 1>Agreeableness is a tricky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tricky trade.</v>

66
00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.140
<v Speaker 1>It's not that easy to figure out because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it overlaps to some degree with what you</v>

67
00:03:30.761 --> 00:03:33.820
<v Speaker 1>might think about extroversion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like extroverts are enthusiastic and</v>

68
00:03:33.821 --> 00:03:35.620
<v Speaker 1>assertive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're also really social,</v>

69
00:03:35.621 --> 00:03:38.380
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They cause they're gregarious and they</v>

70
00:03:38.381 --> 00:03:40.530
<v Speaker 1>like to be around people and they liked</v>
<v Speaker 1>to tell jokes and,</v>

71
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.250
<v Speaker 1>and you might even think of them as</v>
<v Speaker 1>friendly in that if you meet an</v>

72
00:03:45.251 --> 00:03:46.750
<v Speaker 1>extrovert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to make friends with you</v>

73
00:03:46.751 --> 00:03:49.180
<v Speaker 1>pretty quickly or they're going to try</v>
<v Speaker 1>or they're going to try to charm.</v>

74
00:03:49.181 --> 00:03:51.310
<v Speaker 1>You at least are trying to amuse you at</v>
<v Speaker 1>least.</v>

75
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.110
<v Speaker 1>And then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

76
00:03:53.111 --> 00:03:56.680
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness is compassion and and</v>
<v Speaker 1>politeness.</v>

77
00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.650
<v Speaker 1>So how does that exactly differ from</v>
<v Speaker 1>friendliness?</v>

78
00:03:59.651 --> 00:04:01.630
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>warm,</v>

79
00:04:01.631 --> 00:04:05.230
<v Speaker 1>compassionate are compassionate and</v>
<v Speaker 1>empathic people care about you,</v>

80
00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.870
<v Speaker 1>whereas the extrovert doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily care about you.</v>

81
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're in,</v>

82
00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.900
<v Speaker 1>they're interested in being around you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not the same thing as caring for</v>

83
00:04:13.901 --> 00:04:14.531
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

84
00:04:14.531 --> 00:04:19.531
<v Speaker 1>like you could be interested in being</v>
<v Speaker 1>around interested in being around dogs</v>

85
00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.190
<v Speaker 1>to play with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

86
00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.910
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't necessarily mean that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd have any interest in caring for</v>

87
00:04:24.911 --> 00:04:27.430
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so agreeableness looks like a caring</v>

88
00:04:27.431 --> 00:04:29.830
<v Speaker 1>dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the right way to think about</v>

89
00:04:29.831 --> 00:04:31.660
<v Speaker 1>it seems to be to be something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

90
00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.670
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that during your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

91
00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:34.720
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

92
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you engage in a sequence of reciprocal</v>

93
00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.020
<v Speaker 1>trains are reciprocal interactions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

94
00:04:44.021 --> 00:04:45.160
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

95
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.430
<v Speaker 1>how often should you give and how often</v>
<v Speaker 1>should you take?</v>

96
00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.080
<v Speaker 1>And roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it should be 50,</v>

97
00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:50.914
<v Speaker 1>50.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

98
00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:55.210
<v Speaker 1>And hopefully the consequence of that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>each person gains more in fact than they</v>

99
00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:56.980
<v Speaker 1>would if they were just working in</v>
<v Speaker 1>isolation.</v>

100
00:04:56.981 --> 00:05:00.310
<v Speaker 1>So it's a really good deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I would say roughly speaking,</v>

101
00:05:00.311 --> 00:05:05.200
<v Speaker 1>that as you become more agreeable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more like 60 40 for the other</v>

102
00:05:05.201 --> 00:05:07.660
<v Speaker 1>person or 70,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 for the other person or 80,</v>

103
00:05:07.661 --> 00:05:09.130
<v Speaker 1>20.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then as you become more</v>

104
00:05:09.131 --> 00:05:11.020
<v Speaker 1>disagreeable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the other way around.</v>

105
00:05:11.021 --> 00:05:14.530
<v Speaker 1>It's 60% for me and 40% for you and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>forth.</v>

106
00:05:14.531 --> 00:05:19.531
<v Speaker 1>And so one tails off into extreme</v>
<v Speaker 1>selfishness and the other tales off into</v>

107
00:05:20.561 --> 00:05:25.561
<v Speaker 1>extreme</v>
<v Speaker 1>self sacrifice and too much selfishness.</v>

108
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.370
<v Speaker 1>It puts you in prison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And too much self sacrifice.</v>

109
00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:34.540
<v Speaker 1>Well</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's more complicated.</v>

110
00:05:34.541 --> 00:05:38.530
<v Speaker 1>I would say that part of the pathology</v>
<v Speaker 1>that fried identified as characteristic</v>

111
00:05:38.531 --> 00:05:41.470
<v Speaker 1>of the eatable family was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is actually a consequence of too much</v>

112
00:05:41.471 --> 00:05:44.170
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness and sort of the Hansel and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gretel story.</v>

113
00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.450
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you all know the Hansel and Gretel</v>

114
00:05:46.451 --> 00:05:50.020
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hansel and Gretel have their two little</v>

115
00:05:50.021 --> 00:05:53.050
<v Speaker 1>kids and their mother gets remarried or</v>
<v Speaker 1>their father,</v>

116
00:05:53.051 --> 00:05:55.270
<v Speaker 1>I think it's their mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't remember.</v>

117
00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.640
<v Speaker 1>And anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the step decides that the kids are kind</v>

118
00:05:58.641 --> 00:06:03.230
<v Speaker 1>of a pain and that she or he convinces</v>
<v Speaker 1>the alternative partner to take them out</v>

119
00:06:03.231 --> 00:06:06.200
<v Speaker 1>in the forest and just abandoned them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They make their way back once,</v>

120
00:06:06.201 --> 00:06:09.680
<v Speaker 1>but then they take them deeper into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>woods the second time anyway,</v>

121
00:06:09.681 --> 00:06:12.050
<v Speaker 1>so they're wandering out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all lost in the woods.</v>

122
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.810
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is a kind of a symbolic descend</v>

123
00:06:14.811 --> 00:06:16.040
<v Speaker 1>into chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

124
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:17.220
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

125
00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.340
<v Speaker 1>they find a gingerbread house and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

126
00:06:19.341 --> 00:06:22.220
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty good deal when you're a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little kid and you're lost and cold and</v>

127
00:06:22.221 --> 00:06:23.300
<v Speaker 1>it's dark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

128
00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:26.960
<v Speaker 1>it's such a good deal that you might be</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little suspicious of it because not</v>

129
00:06:26.961 --> 00:06:29.030
<v Speaker 1>only is it a house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is right on,</v>

130
00:06:29.031 --> 00:06:32.270
<v Speaker 1>but it's a house made out of cookies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

131
00:06:32.271 --> 00:06:37.130
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and inside there's a woman who wants to</v>

132
00:06:37.131 --> 00:06:38.720
<v Speaker 1>fatten up the kids and eat them.</v>

133
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:41.410
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they eventually managed to fool her push</v>

134
00:06:41.411 --> 00:06:43.400
<v Speaker 1>for in an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's quite a bloodthirsty story,</v>

135
00:06:43.401 --> 00:06:47.270
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of these fairy tales are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a really profound moral in</v>

136
00:06:47.271 --> 00:06:47.710
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

137
00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:52.400
<v Speaker 1>and the profound moral is something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>beware of someone who does too much for</v>

138
00:06:52.401 --> 00:06:55.160
<v Speaker 1>you because there's a devouring element</v>
<v Speaker 1>to that.</v>

139
00:06:55.161 --> 00:06:56.840
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is why,</v>

140
00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.360
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the time when you hear people</v>

141
00:06:59.361 --> 00:07:02.220
<v Speaker 1>talk about things like compassion and</v>
<v Speaker 1>empathy and you know,</v>

142
00:07:02.221 --> 00:07:04.850
<v Speaker 1>on politeness and that sort of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're treated as if they're</v>

143
00:07:04.851 --> 00:07:06.380
<v Speaker 1>untrammeled virtues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

144
00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:08.630
<v Speaker 1>that's a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a mistake,</v>

145
00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:10.850
<v Speaker 1>a grill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a weird trait because there are</v>

146
00:07:10.851 --> 00:07:14.840
<v Speaker 1>market advantages and disadvantages to</v>
<v Speaker 1>people all along the distribution.</v>

147
00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:16.880
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

148
00:07:16.881 --> 00:07:18.440
<v Speaker 1>agree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disagreeable people.</v>

149
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:21.550
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

150
00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:24.530
<v Speaker 1>they're blunt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that would be the impolite element.</v>

151
00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:28.460
<v Speaker 1>And there they don't shy away from</v>
<v Speaker 1>conflict.</v>

152
00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.220
<v Speaker 1>And you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that doesn't sound very good,</v>

153
00:07:31.221 --> 00:07:32.840
<v Speaker 1>but that's not right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lots of times,</v>

154
00:07:32.841 --> 00:07:34.970
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're trying to solve</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard problems,</v>

155
00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:38.290
<v Speaker 1>you want to have people around you who</v>
<v Speaker 1>are blunt and,</v>

156
00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:43.660
<v Speaker 1>and somewhat afraid of conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because very frequently there isn't any</v>

157
00:07:44.211 --> 00:07:47.510
<v Speaker 1>difference between thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>something and having conflict,</v>

158
00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:50.120
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're really committed to an idea</v>

159
00:07:50.121 --> 00:07:53.360
<v Speaker 1>and I'm committed to an idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're either going to act it out</v>

160
00:07:53.361 --> 00:07:57.320
<v Speaker 1>mutually and actually engage in either</v>
<v Speaker 1>competition or direct,</v>

161
00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:00.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>combat roughly speaking or we're going</v>

162
00:08:00.321 --> 00:08:04.940
<v Speaker 1>to hash it out so that we can exist</v>
<v Speaker 1>harmoniously as we move into the future.</v>

163
00:08:04.941 --> 00:08:09.920
<v Speaker 1>And the problem with avoiding conflict</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that conflict's inevitable.</v>

164
00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:13.430
<v Speaker 1>Like because sometimes a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what to do and it's a</v>

165
00:08:13.431 --> 00:08:15.590
<v Speaker 1>really complicated situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

166
00:08:15.591 --> 00:08:19.580
<v Speaker 1>so you have one position on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe your partner has another position.</v>

167
00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:23.570
<v Speaker 1>Both positions are justifiable say with</v>
<v Speaker 1>regards to disciplining children cause</v>

168
00:08:23.571 --> 00:08:28.250
<v Speaker 1>that's one or with finances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are common points of contradiction</v>

169
00:08:28.251 --> 00:08:30.680
<v Speaker 1>between couples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's not obvious who's right.</v>

170
00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:33.140
<v Speaker 1>So how do you figure it out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

171
00:08:33.141 --> 00:08:37.820
<v Speaker 1>you either push each other around</v>
<v Speaker 1>physically or you push each other around</v>

172
00:08:37.821 --> 00:08:40.240
<v Speaker 1>mentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think has made it even worse</v>

173
00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.970
<v Speaker 1>over the long run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you hit the problem straight on and</v>

174
00:08:43.971 --> 00:08:48.440
<v Speaker 1>address it and then there's conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But maybe if you're fortunate,</v>

175
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.770
<v Speaker 1>you get through the conflict and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out the problem and then you can</v>

176
00:08:51.771 --> 00:08:55.590
<v Speaker 1>have peace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the de they downside to</v>

177
00:08:55.591 --> 00:09:00.210
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that it's over concerned with the</v>

178
00:09:00.211 --> 00:09:02.730
<v Speaker 1>establishment of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the maintenance of peace in the</v>

179
00:09:02.731 --> 00:09:07.620
<v Speaker 1>present and under concerned with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>establishment of peace in the future.</v>

180
00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:10.470
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's what</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness does instead.</v>

181
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:13.500
<v Speaker 1>So my idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea if this is correct by the</v>

182
00:09:13.501 --> 00:09:14.334
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

183
00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:17.490
<v Speaker 1>so I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm moving out towards the fringes of</v>

184
00:09:17.491 --> 00:09:20.100
<v Speaker 1>knowledge on personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think one per what happened,</v>

185
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.890
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to get conscientiousness out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of animals.</v>

186
00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:25.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like most things you can develop an</v>

187
00:09:25.651 --> 00:09:26.880
<v Speaker 1>animal model for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

188
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.310
<v Speaker 1>Conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a tough one.</v>

189
00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:31.850
<v Speaker 1>We haven't been able to come up with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable animal model or</v>

190
00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:34.830
<v Speaker 1>neuropsychological model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Laura psychopharmacological model or a</v>

191
00:09:34.831 --> 00:09:39.120
<v Speaker 1>theoretical model or a cognitive model</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the things we don't know about</v>

192
00:09:39.121 --> 00:09:42.120
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conscientiousness are are manifold,</v>

193
00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:45.490
<v Speaker 1>but anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what's happened is the degree of</v>

194
00:09:45.491 --> 00:09:50.491
<v Speaker 1>illness is a good heuristic for</v>
<v Speaker 1>establishing harmonious egalitarianism</v>

195
00:09:52.321 --> 00:09:54.720
<v Speaker 1>in very small groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

196
00:09:54.721 --> 00:09:58.410
<v Speaker 1>if you're in a family and you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>parents because generally if you're in a</v>

197
00:09:58.411 --> 00:10:01.380
<v Speaker 1>family you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know one of the concerns about the</v>

198
00:10:01.381 --> 00:10:04.350
<v Speaker 1>parents is that resources are fairly</v>
<v Speaker 1>distributed.</v>

199
00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:08.100
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in generally parents are loath to really</v>

200
00:10:08.101 --> 00:10:13.101
<v Speaker 1>produce much of a dominance hierarchy in</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of affection in relationship to</v>

201
00:10:13.381 --> 00:10:14.430
<v Speaker 1>their children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

202
00:10:14.431 --> 00:10:17.790
<v Speaker 1>It seems kind of like a violation of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>parental contact contract.</v>

203
00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:20.910
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then the question is what happens</v>

204
00:10:20.911 --> 00:10:25.580
<v Speaker 1>when you enter into bigger organizations</v>
<v Speaker 1>where familial ties either can't be</v>

205
00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:29.940
<v Speaker 1>maintained merely because of the size of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the organization or because the</v>

206
00:10:29.941 --> 00:10:33.270
<v Speaker 1>organization is just too complex to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>run that way.</v>

207
00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:36.960
<v Speaker 1>I think that's when conscientiousness</v>
<v Speaker 1>kicks in and conscientiousness is more</v>

208
00:10:36.961 --> 00:10:40.830
<v Speaker 1>of a cold virtue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not exactly based as far as we</v>

209
00:10:40.831 --> 00:10:43.170
<v Speaker 1>could tell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not based in any social emotion.</v>

210
00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:48.440
<v Speaker 1>It's more like here are the articulated</v>
<v Speaker 1>rules whereby the social organization</v>

211
00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:53.070
<v Speaker 1>functions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to adhere to those and follow</v>

212
00:10:53.071 --> 00:10:54.960
<v Speaker 1>them and that's what makes me</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientious.</v>

213
00:10:54.961 --> 00:10:59.070
<v Speaker 1>Now there's an order of the part and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be absence of rule breaking</v>

214
00:10:59.071 --> 00:11:01.260
<v Speaker 1>and keeping things in their proper</v>
<v Speaker 1>position.</v>

215
00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.540
<v Speaker 1>And then there's an industriousness</v>
<v Speaker 1>element,</v>

216
00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:07.950
<v Speaker 1>which also seems to have something to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>with keeping social norms.</v>

217
00:11:07.951 --> 00:11:12.270
<v Speaker 1>Like although there's an element of</v>
<v Speaker 1>going for the ideal instead of just not</v>

218
00:11:12.271 --> 00:11:16.620
<v Speaker 1>breaking rules and industriousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative people are more</v>

219
00:11:16.621 --> 00:11:19.440
<v Speaker 1>conscientious than liberal people and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of makes sense,</v>

220
00:11:19.441 --> 00:11:21.510
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because conscientiousness is concerned</v>

221
00:11:21.511 --> 00:11:25.530
<v Speaker 1>with the maintenance of current social</v>
<v Speaker 1>rules and then playing the game</v>

222
00:11:25.531 --> 00:11:28.470
<v Speaker 1>according to the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Liberals are higher in openness and</v>

223
00:11:28.471 --> 00:11:32.040
<v Speaker 1>lower in conscientiousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're more likely to transform the</v>

224
00:11:32.041 --> 00:11:34.110
<v Speaker 1>rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is something conservatives don't</v>

225
00:11:34.111 --> 00:11:36.690
<v Speaker 1>relate because they're doing fine</v>
<v Speaker 1>playing the current gate,</v>

226
00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.580
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's some real utility in</v>

227
00:11:38.581 --> 00:11:43.470
<v Speaker 1>maintaining the current game because if</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's too unstable then well then you</v>

228
00:11:43.471 --> 00:11:45.960
<v Speaker 1>have a descent into chaos and that's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>good for anybody.</v>

229
00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:47.513
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

230
00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:52.520
<v Speaker 1>so back to agreeableness now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the big difference men and women in</v>

231
00:11:53.981 --> 00:11:57.700
<v Speaker 1>terms of traits seems to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you could put,</v>

232
00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:01.630
<v Speaker 1>first of all I should show you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see if I got this here.</v>

233
00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:05.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's two overlapping normal</v>

234
00:12:05.471 --> 00:12:06.670
<v Speaker 1>distributions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

235
00:12:06.671 --> 00:12:09.340
<v Speaker 1>And the blue ones are women and the red</v>
<v Speaker 1>ones are Nana.</v>

236
00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:13.900
<v Speaker 1>And the blue is agreeableness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the blue is shifted over to the</v>

237
00:12:13.901 --> 00:12:17.260
<v Speaker 1>more agreeable side and the red is</v>
<v Speaker 1>shifted over to the less agreeable side.</v>

238
00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:21.250
<v Speaker 1>The first thing that you should notice</v>
<v Speaker 1>about that isn't that the differences</v>

239
00:12:21.251 --> 00:12:23.680
<v Speaker 1>exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first thing that you should notice</v>

240
00:12:23.681 --> 00:12:27.070
<v Speaker 1>is that almost all of the territory is</v>
<v Speaker 1>overlapped.</v>

241
00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:31.870
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is that if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>took men and women,</v>

242
00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:34.870
<v Speaker 1>if you drew men and women randomly from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the population,</v>

243
00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:40.830
<v Speaker 1>there'd be a deviation from 50 50 with</v>
<v Speaker 1>regards to who was the most agreeable</v>

244
00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:43.570
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at least,</v>

245
00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:46.510
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see if I can get this right.</v>

246
00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:52.830
<v Speaker 1>I probably can't because I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember exactly the effect size.</v>

247
00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:58.160
<v Speaker 1>It's probably about 0.2 maybe it'd be</v>
<v Speaker 1>60% probability that you draw out a</v>

248
00:12:58.591 --> 00:13:02.850
<v Speaker 1>woman who was as more agreeable and 40%</v>
<v Speaker 1>probability that you draw to man,</v>

249
00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:05.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a deviation from 50 50 so there's</v>

250
00:13:05.761 --> 00:13:08.610
<v Speaker 1>lots of women who are more disagreeable</v>
<v Speaker 1>than men and there are lots of men who</v>

251
00:13:08.611 --> 00:13:10.590
<v Speaker 1>are more agreeable than the typical</v>
<v Speaker 1>woman.</v>

252
00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:13.440
<v Speaker 1>But there are differences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that's really</v>

253
00:13:13.441 --> 00:13:15.600
<v Speaker 1>worth noting when you look at a normal</v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution,</v>

254
00:13:15.601 --> 00:13:19.980
<v Speaker 1>because this is where things get weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could say there's not that much</v>

255
00:13:19.981 --> 00:13:22.890
<v Speaker 1>difference on average between men and</v>
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>

256
00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:25.770
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is the average is often</v>
<v Speaker 1>knock them relevant issue.</v>

257
00:13:25.771 --> 00:13:29.820
<v Speaker 1>The relevant issue is often the extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

258
00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:34.050
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to imprison people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so look at that red curve.</v>

259
00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:37.590
<v Speaker 1>What you see is that if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it's not drawn exactly</v>

260
00:13:37.591 --> 00:13:39.630
<v Speaker 1>perfectly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what you would see if the curve was</v>

261
00:13:39.631 --> 00:13:44.400
<v Speaker 1>proper here</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that once you were out here,</v>

262
00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:48.570
<v Speaker 1>say where the you could only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're only interested in the one out of</v>

263
00:13:48.571 --> 00:13:52.560
<v Speaker 1>50 most disagreeable person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those people would be mad.</v>

264
00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:57.810
<v Speaker 1>And that's why partly why almost</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody in prison is male.</v>

265
00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:01.230
<v Speaker 1>So the x,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you don't put people in prison</v>

266
00:14:01.231 --> 00:14:03.600
<v Speaker 1>unless they're very extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things</v>

267
00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:08.720
<v Speaker 1>criminals tend to be extreme in his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're low in agreeableness,</v>

268
00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:09.800
<v Speaker 1>surprise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>surprise.</v>

269
00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:12.020
<v Speaker 1>They're kind of callous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're in it for themselves.</v>

270
00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:13.730
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're stubborn,</v>

271
00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:15.560
<v Speaker 1>they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't care about you one way or</v>

272
00:14:15.561 --> 00:14:17.870
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if they're low in agreeableness and</v>

273
00:14:17.871 --> 00:14:19.900
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they don't care about you and they</v>

274
00:14:19.901 --> 00:14:23.180
<v Speaker 1>aren't going to play by the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That started to touch on psychopathy.</v>

275
00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:26.210
<v Speaker 1>So you can model psychopathy pretty well</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the big five,</v>

276
00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:28.460
<v Speaker 1>low agreeableness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>low conscientiousness.</v>

277
00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:31.250
<v Speaker 1>So then you get someone who could care</v>
<v Speaker 1>less about you,</v>

278
00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:34.310
<v Speaker 1>who lies all the time or who doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>follow the rules,</v>

279
00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.950
<v Speaker 1>won't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they have a parasitical lifestyle,</v>

280
00:14:36.951 --> 00:14:40.610
<v Speaker 1>which is actually one of the dimensions</v>
<v Speaker 1>of psychopathy,</v>

281
00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:43.870
<v Speaker 1>a pair of civical lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

282
00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:47.720
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if you look over on the other</v>

283
00:14:47.721 --> 00:14:50.750
<v Speaker 1>direction and you took the one in 50</v>
<v Speaker 1>person who was the most compassionate</v>

284
00:14:50.751 --> 00:14:53.630
<v Speaker 1>then that be virtually all those people</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be women.</v>

285
00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:56.960
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh I,</v>

286
00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:01.980
<v Speaker 1>I've gone up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is probability is 63% so it's 63%</v>

287
00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:06.650
<v Speaker 1>chance that the woman you drew wrote</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be more agreeable than 37% chance</v>

288
00:15:06.651 --> 00:15:11.360
<v Speaker 1>that the men men would be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can convert most effect size</v>

289
00:15:11.361 --> 00:15:14.540
<v Speaker 1>statistics into odds ratios like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll actually tell you about how to</v>

290
00:15:14.541 --> 00:15:17.330
<v Speaker 1>do that later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's quite cool and it really gives you</v>

291
00:15:17.331 --> 00:15:20.120
<v Speaker 1>a much bigger understanding of what an</v>
<v Speaker 1>effect means.</v>

292
00:15:20.121 --> 00:15:22.430
<v Speaker 1>Like one of the things you won't be</v>
<v Speaker 1>taught about properly,</v>

293
00:15:22.431 --> 00:15:24.290
<v Speaker 1>you don't likelihood when you take your</v>
<v Speaker 1>statistics,</v>

294
00:15:24.291 --> 00:15:27.230
<v Speaker 1>although it might've changed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that they won't tell you how to</v>

295
00:15:27.231 --> 00:15:30.380
<v Speaker 1>interpret the size of an effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And really the only thing that matters</v>

296
00:15:30.381 --> 00:15:32.180
<v Speaker 1>is how big is the effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

297
00:15:32.181 --> 00:15:34.070
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be in most studies,</v>

298
00:15:34.071 --> 00:15:34.904
<v Speaker 1>that would be</v>

299
00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:44.920
<v Speaker 1>the size of the effect would be the</v>
<v Speaker 1>distance between one of those peaks in</v>

300
00:15:44.921 --> 00:15:45.671
<v Speaker 1>the distance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

301
00:15:45.671 --> 00:15:47.740
<v Speaker 1>and the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how much the groups differ.</v>

302
00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:49.390
<v Speaker 1>And then of course the group's</v>
<v Speaker 1>different,</v>

303
00:15:49.391 --> 00:15:52.630
<v Speaker 1>but there's this spread up to the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>within the groups differ as well.</v>

304
00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:57.410
<v Speaker 1>So the statistical calculation takes</v>
<v Speaker 1>into account how big the mean difference</v>

305
00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:02.350
<v Speaker 1>is by well correcting for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the spread of the numbers around</v>

306
00:16:02.351 --> 00:16:05.980
<v Speaker 1>that meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so and so you need well and you need</v>

307
00:16:05.981 --> 00:16:09.430
<v Speaker 1>to know how big that effect is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you need to be able to understand</v>

308
00:16:09.431 --> 00:16:12.700
<v Speaker 1>that in a way that's visualized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

309
00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:16.630
<v Speaker 1>you might have a correlation Coefficient</v>
<v Speaker 1>of 0.2 so what you'd imagined,</v>

310
00:16:16.631 --> 00:16:21.631
<v Speaker 1>imagine a graph like this and then a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of dots and then align running</v>

311
00:16:22.901 --> 00:16:25.990
<v Speaker 1>through them at 0.2.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of dots that aren't on the</v>

312
00:16:25.991 --> 00:16:29.560
<v Speaker 1>line because it's only accounting for</v>
<v Speaker 1>40% of the various right cause you</v>

313
00:16:29.561 --> 00:16:31.180
<v Speaker 1>square it to get proportion of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>variance.</v>

314
00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:33.880
<v Speaker 1>So 0.2,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some relationship that not much,</v>

315
00:16:33.881 --> 00:16:38.080
<v Speaker 1>there's an awful lot of scattered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the two variables are related.</v>

316
00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:42.160
<v Speaker 1>If you have an rf 0.2,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can calculate an odds ratio.</v>

317
00:16:42.161 --> 00:16:43.570
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it turns out to be 60,</v>

318
00:16:43.571 --> 00:16:47.110
<v Speaker 1>40,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the r is the difference between</v>

319
00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:51.500
<v Speaker 1>the probability of one group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

320
00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:55.510
<v Speaker 1>Probability of drawing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now a member of one group characterized</v>

321
00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:58.060
<v Speaker 1>by that particular feature compared to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the member of the other group.</v>

322
00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.830
<v Speaker 1>So you get a hat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to get,</v>

323
00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:00.990
<v Speaker 1>have uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

324
00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:03.730
<v Speaker 1>an ad hand way of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

325
00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:07.960
<v Speaker 1>of understanding these effects sizes</v>
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise you can't understand</v>

326
00:17:07.961 --> 00:17:11.020
<v Speaker 1>psychological papers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what's a correlation of 0.1?</v>

327
00:17:11.021 --> 00:17:12.780
<v Speaker 1>What's that good for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's a for you know,</v>

328
00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:15.130
<v Speaker 1>what correlation point to a correlation</v>
<v Speaker 1>of 0.3.</v>

329
00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:19.990
<v Speaker 1>And it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very tricky because you're most of the</v>

330
00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:23.260
<v Speaker 1>like there are people who've made sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of tables of whether or not you should</v>

331
00:17:23.261 --> 00:17:24.910
<v Speaker 1>consider an effect size,</v>
<v Speaker 1>large,</v>

332
00:17:24.911 --> 00:17:25.990
<v Speaker 1>medium or small.</v>

333
00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:31.140
<v Speaker 1>But it was basically a guests just like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 0.05 level of significance was an</v>

334
00:17:32.171 --> 00:17:34.540
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhat arbitrary decision.</v>

335
00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.240
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you'll find is that in</v>

336
00:17:37.241 --> 00:17:40.300
<v Speaker 1>psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you rarely see two variables that are</v>

337
00:17:40.301 --> 00:17:43.360
<v Speaker 1>related to one another more than 0.3.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

338
00:17:43.361 --> 00:17:45.490
<v Speaker 1>You need to know that because if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know that,</v>

339
00:17:45.491 --> 00:17:48.310
<v Speaker 1>you have no idea what to make of a given</v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon.</v>

340
00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:50.400
<v Speaker 1>So for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's tricky.</v>

341
00:17:50.401 --> 00:17:54.750
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an optimized combination of Iq and</v>

342
00:17:54.751 --> 00:17:59.340
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness and predict your job</v>
<v Speaker 1>performance at somewhere between 0.5 and</v>

343
00:17:59.341 --> 00:18:04.341
<v Speaker 1>0.6 so now if you square that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's 25 to 36% of the variants and you</v>

344
00:18:05.251 --> 00:18:06.480
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's not very much,</v>

345
00:18:06.481 --> 00:18:09.030
<v Speaker 1>it's only a quarter of the variance in</v>
<v Speaker 1>job performance,</v>

346
00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:11.730
<v Speaker 1>but it's hard to measure job</v>
<v Speaker 1>performance.</v>

347
00:18:11.731 --> 00:18:15.300
<v Speaker 1>So there's lots of error in it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's error in the measurement of</v>

348
00:18:15.301 --> 00:18:17.730
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So some of that's just noise,</v>

349
00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:20.640
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but importantly,</v>

350
00:18:20.641 --> 00:18:25.200
<v Speaker 1>even if it's 25% of the variance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we said a correlation of 0.5 then you</v>

351
00:18:25.201 --> 00:18:29.160
<v Speaker 1>could use it to raise the probability</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you'd pick up an above average</v>

352
00:18:29.161 --> 00:18:34.161
<v Speaker 1>employee from 50 50 to 75 25 cause 75</v>
<v Speaker 1>minus 25.5 so it's a big effect.</v>

353
00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:42.810
<v Speaker 1>And then the economic consequences of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are Nassif because it turns out,</v>

354
00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:45.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a very good at what you do and</v>

355
00:18:45.301 --> 00:18:47.370
<v Speaker 1>you're not very good at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might say,</v>

356
00:18:47.371 --> 00:18:51.270
<v Speaker 1>well how much more is it to my advantage</v>
<v Speaker 1>to employ you rather than you?</v>

357
00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:53.520
<v Speaker 1>And one of the questions would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

358
00:18:53.521 --> 00:18:56.730
<v Speaker 1>how much difference in performance is</v>
<v Speaker 1>there between people?</v>

359
00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:01.230
<v Speaker 1>Like if everyone lines up like maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a assembly line job and once you</v>

360
00:19:01.231 --> 00:19:02.970
<v Speaker 1>get it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you're trained,</v>

361
00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:05.850
<v Speaker 1>everyone has exactly the same rate of</v>
<v Speaker 1>production.</v>

362
00:19:05.851 --> 00:19:08.580
<v Speaker 1>Well then it doesn't matter if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

363
00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:11.580
<v Speaker 1>if you have a higher Iq and you're more</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientious because there's no</v>

364
00:19:11.581 --> 00:19:16.050
<v Speaker 1>variability in the performance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in lots of jobs there's massive</v>

365
00:19:16.051 --> 00:19:18.480
<v Speaker 1>variability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might even be nonlinear.</v>

366
00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:21.480
<v Speaker 1>And we'll talk about that when we get to</v>
<v Speaker 1>our discussion of the prieto</v>

367
00:19:21.481 --> 00:19:24.930
<v Speaker 1>distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what that means is that some people</v>

368
00:19:24.931 --> 00:19:27.360
<v Speaker 1>are not only not productive in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>job,</v>

369
00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:29.670
<v Speaker 1>they're negatively productive in a big</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

370
00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:32.520
<v Speaker 1>You hire them and they take money out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the company.</v>

371
00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:34.530
<v Speaker 1>So this often happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

372
00:19:34.531 --> 00:19:38.100
<v Speaker 1>if you hiring competent managers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because not only are they not doing</v>

373
00:19:38.101 --> 00:19:40.680
<v Speaker 1>their job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're stopping 20 other people from</v>

374
00:19:40.681 --> 00:19:42.540
<v Speaker 1>doing their job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they're,</v>

375
00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:45.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating resources like mad doing that.</v>

376
00:19:45.151 --> 00:19:47.490
<v Speaker 1>So it can be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a re can be a real catastrophe.</v>

377
00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:51.270
<v Speaker 1>So bad hire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone's making $100,000 a year,</v>

378
00:19:51.271 --> 00:19:54.660
<v Speaker 1>a bad hire costs the company about</v>
<v Speaker 1>$350,000.</v>

379
00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:57.990
<v Speaker 1>So you didn't need many of those before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're a small company</v>

380
00:19:57.991 --> 00:20:00.270
<v Speaker 1>before you're just done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

381
00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:03.420
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the distribution between people in terms</v>

382
00:20:03.421 --> 00:20:06.540
<v Speaker 1>of performance varies with job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But with some jobs it's tremendous.</v>

383
00:20:06.541 --> 00:20:08.130
<v Speaker 1>Like in sales,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

384
00:20:08.131 --> 00:20:12.840
<v Speaker 1>so in sales you really see us prieto</v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution where almost everyone is</v>

385
00:20:12.841 --> 00:20:16.530
<v Speaker 1>making no sales and then there's a few</v>
<v Speaker 1>people at the end of the distribution</v>

386
00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:19.080
<v Speaker 1>who are doing all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

387
00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:21.480
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of jobs that are like that.</v>

388
00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:24.240
<v Speaker 1>They're not normally diff production</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't normally distributed.</v>

389
00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:26.250
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

390
00:20:26.251 --> 00:20:27.900
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to</v>

391
00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:30.803
<v Speaker 2>back to</v>

392
00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:33.810
<v Speaker 1>aggression or agreeableness here.</v>

393
00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:39.990
<v Speaker 1>So most of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the time what you'll see in</v>

394
00:20:39.991 --> 00:20:44.991
<v Speaker 1>psychology is that the statistical</v>
<v Speaker 1>assumption that's made in a paper when</v>

395
00:20:45.391 --> 00:20:49.450
<v Speaker 1>they're comparing two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know is one group significantly</v>

396
00:20:49.451 --> 00:20:52.360
<v Speaker 1>different than the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The statistics are predicated on the</v>

397
00:20:52.361 --> 00:20:55.990
<v Speaker 1>assumption that the distribution of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those scores is normal.</v>

398
00:20:56.440 --> 00:21:00.100
<v Speaker 1>And what you'll hear a psychologist</v>
<v Speaker 1>telling you is this central limit</v>

399
00:21:00.101 --> 00:21:02.350
<v Speaker 1>Theorem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is this theorem says that if a</v>

400
00:21:02.351 --> 00:21:07.351
<v Speaker 1>random variable x is the sum of a large</v>
<v Speaker 1>number of small and independent random</v>

401
00:21:07.421 --> 00:21:11.020
<v Speaker 1>variables than almost no matter how the</v>
<v Speaker 1>small variables are distributed,</v>

402
00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:13.600
<v Speaker 1>x will approximately be normally</v>
<v Speaker 1>distributed.</v>

403
00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:15.830
<v Speaker 1>While you think if you take human traits</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

404
00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:18.460
<v Speaker 1>like let's say intelligence for that</v>
<v Speaker 1>matter,</v>

405
00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:23.740
<v Speaker 1>God only knows how many genetic random</v>
<v Speaker 1>genetic factors that could have been one</v>

406
00:21:23.741 --> 00:21:28.320
<v Speaker 1>way or another have to sum up to cause,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

407
00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:33.330
<v Speaker 1>to produce the influenced the</v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual capacity of one person and</v>

408
00:21:34.151 --> 00:21:35.980
<v Speaker 1>then to produce that amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>variation.</v>

409
00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:39.310
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of random things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens is it comes out</v>

410
00:21:39.311 --> 00:21:41.890
<v Speaker 1>basically normally distributed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

411
00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:46.270
<v Speaker 1>but some things aren't randomly</v>
<v Speaker 1>distributed and production seems to be</v>

412
00:21:46.271 --> 00:21:48.640
<v Speaker 1>one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And success seems to be another,</v>

413
00:21:48.641 --> 00:21:49.570
<v Speaker 1>which is why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

414
00:21:49.571 --> 00:21:53.020
<v Speaker 1>1% of the people have 50% of the money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because what happens is,</v>

415
00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:56.770
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're smart and you work hard,</v>

416
00:21:56.771 --> 00:21:58.690
<v Speaker 1>then you multiply how smart you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

417
00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:02.410
<v Speaker 1>But then it starts to accrue to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

418
00:22:02.411 --> 00:22:07.360
<v Speaker 1>So if you have $100,000 in the bank and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's making say 5% a year,</v>

419
00:22:07.361 --> 00:22:10.060
<v Speaker 1>you make quite a bit of money just</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you already have the money.</v>

420
00:22:10.061 --> 00:22:13.090
<v Speaker 1>So having the money puts you in the game</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it does if you're in the real</v>

421
00:22:13.091 --> 00:22:16.600
<v Speaker 1>estate market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And once you start to become successful</v>

422
00:22:16.601 --> 00:22:19.180
<v Speaker 1>at something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then people expect you to be</v>

423
00:22:19.181 --> 00:22:22.460
<v Speaker 1>successful and they open up more doors</v>
<v Speaker 1>to you and your,</v>

424
00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:24.610
<v Speaker 1>your network of influence wines.</v>

425
00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:27.400
<v Speaker 1>And so you have more opportunities and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then people come to you.</v>

426
00:22:27.401 --> 00:22:31.810
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens is that as you start</v>
<v Speaker 1>to become successful,</v>

427
00:22:31.811 --> 00:22:34.870
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>become increasingly successful</v>

428
00:22:34.871 --> 00:22:38.080
<v Speaker 1>increases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you can get into an exponential</v>

429
00:22:38.081 --> 00:22:40.000
<v Speaker 1>rate of return,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly what you want to have</v>

430
00:22:40.001 --> 00:22:41.290
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you start a startup,</v>

431
00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:42.640
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want linear growth,</v>

432
00:22:42.641 --> 00:22:46.210
<v Speaker 1>you'll just die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want it to go viral and most things</v>

433
00:22:46.211 --> 00:22:48.160
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the things that do are super</v>

434
00:22:48.161 --> 00:22:51.160
<v Speaker 1>successful and people go viral during</v>
<v Speaker 1>their lifetime,</v>

435
00:22:51.161 --> 00:22:54.970
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're engaged in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of creative in,</v>

436
00:22:54.971 --> 00:22:59.110
<v Speaker 1>in some sort of creative enterprise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And making money actually turns out to</v>

437
00:22:59.111 --> 00:23:02.590
<v Speaker 1>be from the entrepreneurial perspective</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>

438
00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:05.260
<v Speaker 1>essentially a creative enterprise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that surprising.</v>

439
00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:07.840
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that no one will</v>

440
00:23:07.841 --> 00:23:12.610
<v Speaker 1>probably ever show you is why things are</v>
<v Speaker 1>normally distributed and what exactly</v>

441
00:23:12.611 --> 00:23:14.800
<v Speaker 1>that means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm going to show you something.</v>

442
00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:17.350
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I even have a,</v>

443
00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:22.210
<v Speaker 1>I might even have saved video of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would be smart and,</v>

444
00:23:22.211 --> 00:23:23.044
<v Speaker 1>but unlikely.</v>

445
00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:00.490
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should have had this,</v>

446
00:24:00.491 --> 00:24:02.200
<v Speaker 3>but I forgot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forgot about it till now.</v>

447
00:24:02.201 --> 00:24:03.034
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

448
00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:08.450
<v Speaker 2>well we'll just look on youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that should do the trick.</v>

449
00:24:09.410 --> 00:24:11.920
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gold,</v>

450
00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:23.313
<v Speaker 2>that's a good one.</v>

451
00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:49.400
<v Speaker 3>It's called,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want you to do is you take a ball,</v>

452
00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:53.670
<v Speaker 3>you drop it into the tall and it bounces</v>
<v Speaker 3>off all these nails before it makes,</v>

453
00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:58.500
<v Speaker 3>going into one of these categories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when the ball hits is,</v>

454
00:24:58.670 --> 00:24:59.503
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

455
00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:06.120
<v Speaker 3>This is it go from bullet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

456
00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:08.390
<v Speaker 3>because the first person to meet one of</v>
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

457
00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:13.550
<v Speaker 3>and so it was cold Galton I want you to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do is you take a ball,</v>

458
00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:17.990
<v Speaker 3>you drop it into the top and it balances</v>
<v Speaker 3>off all these nails before basically</v>

459
00:25:17.991 --> 00:25:20.310
<v Speaker 3>going into one of these categories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

460
00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:24.590
<v Speaker 3>and when the ball hits each night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in theory there is a 50,</v>

461
00:25:24.591 --> 00:25:29.591
<v Speaker 3>50 chance of it going left or right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so each path is pretty much</v>

462
00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:33.590
<v Speaker 3>unpredictable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I was to take two balls and put them</v>

463
00:25:33.591 --> 00:25:35.990
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I'm trying to get the exactly the</v>

464
00:25:35.991 --> 00:25:38.840
<v Speaker 3>same,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they will end up in completely different</v>

465
00:25:38.841 --> 00:25:41.990
<v Speaker 3>positions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We cannot accurately predict where any</v>

466
00:25:41.991 --> 00:25:44.150
<v Speaker 3>given board more go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>

467
00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:49.250
<v Speaker 3>we can make a few statements,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can say that or is more likely to end</v>

468
00:25:49.251 --> 00:25:51.020
<v Speaker 3>up then in the middle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the age,</v>

469
00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:54.620
<v Speaker 3>because of they said two categories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are lots of different paths.</v>

470
00:25:54.621 --> 00:25:58.010
<v Speaker 3>It ended up here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are only a few tasks to end up on</v>

471
00:25:58.011 --> 00:26:01.760
<v Speaker 3>the edge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we can do is take this piece of</v>

472
00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:07.970
<v Speaker 3>scientific equipment</v>
<v Speaker 3>and stop putting an easy it by the</v>

473
00:26:07.971 --> 00:26:08.804
<v Speaker 3>handful.</v>

474
00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:09.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

475
00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:12.510
<v Speaker 3>if we put it absolutely loads of biggest</v>
<v Speaker 3>balls,</v>

476
00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:16.530
<v Speaker 3>even though each individual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>while we could accurately predict where</v>

477
00:26:16.531 --> 00:26:19.770
<v Speaker 3>it's going the way we can accurately for</v>
<v Speaker 3>date,</v>

478
00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:25.100
<v Speaker 3>the overall package</v>
<v Speaker 3>I met pat and we ended up with is called</v>

479
00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:33.500
<v Speaker 3>a normal distribution in fact to a</v>
<v Speaker 3>funeral.</v>

480
00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:36.440
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now imagine when you're looking at</v>

481
00:26:36.441 --> 00:26:41.090
<v Speaker 3>mean differences between groups.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's in some sense analogous to asking</v>

482
00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:44.070
<v Speaker 3>if all the have fallen</v>

483
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:47.580
<v Speaker 1>into a pattern because there's one entry</v>
<v Speaker 1>point or two,</v>

484
00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:49.260
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>

485
00:26:49.261 --> 00:26:51.060
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the difference between one and</v>

486
00:26:51.061 --> 00:26:54.030
<v Speaker 1>two?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because maybe one entry point is here in</v>

487
00:26:54.031 --> 00:26:56.640
<v Speaker 1>one entry point is here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the same?</v>

488
00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:59.010
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe they're here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

489
00:26:59.011 --> 00:27:04.011
<v Speaker 1>so there's a continuum of same and</v>
<v Speaker 1>different and you can calculate the</v>

490
00:27:05.251 --> 00:27:09.600
<v Speaker 1>probability that one normal just that</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a distribution is a single</v>

491
00:27:09.601 --> 00:27:11.670
<v Speaker 1>distribution from a single point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would be,</v>

492
00:27:11.671 --> 00:27:14.910
<v Speaker 1>there's no mean differences or that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>from two different points,</v>

493
00:27:14.911 --> 00:27:16.890
<v Speaker 1>which would be a mean difference between</v>
<v Speaker 1>the groups.</v>

494
00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:20.400
<v Speaker 1>So you get a curve like this and a curve</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this and then you can do a</v>

495
00:27:20.401 --> 00:27:25.401
<v Speaker 1>statistical calculation that would tell</v>
<v Speaker 1>you what the probability of that shape</v>

496
00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:30.830
<v Speaker 1>emerging merely from chance would be at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we've picked in psychology and many</v>

497
00:27:30.991 --> 00:27:34.410
<v Speaker 1>sciences is this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there's less than a one in 20 chance</v>

498
00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:37.860
<v Speaker 1>that the shape of the distribution is by</v>
<v Speaker 1>chance,</v>

499
00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:42.210
<v Speaker 1>then you can infer that there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>significant difference between the two</v>

500
00:27:42.211 --> 00:27:47.211
<v Speaker 1>groups because you could have a pattern</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that emerge in this experiment.</v>

501
00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:51.190
<v Speaker 1>Just out of chance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

502
00:27:51.191 --> 00:27:53.460
<v Speaker 1>with if you see the one that's on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>board there right now,</v>

503
00:27:53.461 --> 00:27:55.650
<v Speaker 1>you see there's two peaks in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>

504
00:27:55.651 --> 00:27:57.060
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are the peaks of two different</v>

505
00:27:57.061 --> 00:27:58.980
<v Speaker 1>populations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very unlikely.</v>

506
00:27:59.370 --> 00:28:04.370
<v Speaker 1>Now how you calculate whether the</v>
<v Speaker 1>difference between those two peaks is</v>

507
00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:07.560
<v Speaker 1>significant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From a statistical perspective,</v>

508
00:28:07.561 --> 00:28:09.600
<v Speaker 1>it's partly based on chance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

509
00:28:09.601 --> 00:28:10.434
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

510
00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:12.850
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

511
00:28:12.850 --> 00:28:15.220
<v Speaker 1>It's just the probability that that</v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution would,</v>

512
00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:19.870
<v Speaker 1>would manifest itself spontaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's also affected by how many balls</v>

513
00:28:19.871 --> 00:28:23.290
<v Speaker 1>you dropped down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that if you</v>

514
00:28:23.291 --> 00:28:27.460
<v Speaker 1>only drop down one ball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have a normal distribution?</v>

515
00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:29.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>

516
00:28:29.410 --> 00:28:34.410
<v Speaker 1>but you can't tell because there's only</v>
<v Speaker 1>one ball and maybe you drop 10 down and</v>

517
00:28:34.810 --> 00:28:39.430
<v Speaker 1>while you're going to get something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe is patchy and maybe has one or two</v>

518
00:28:39.431 --> 00:28:42.280
<v Speaker 1>places where there's two bowls stack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's still not much of a normal</v>

519
00:28:42.281 --> 00:28:45.700
<v Speaker 1>distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you draw up 150,000 of them down</v>

520
00:28:45.701 --> 00:28:48.130
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be virtually perfect.</v>

521
00:28:48.131 --> 00:28:52.750
<v Speaker 1>And so basically what happens is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the statistics in for are based on the</v>

522
00:28:52.751 --> 00:28:56.680
<v Speaker 1>presupposition that the more subjects</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have in the experiment,</v>

523
00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:59.560
<v Speaker 1>the better the shape of the normal</v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution,</v>

524
00:28:59.561 --> 00:29:04.000
<v Speaker 1>which would be the tighter the</v>
<v Speaker 1>approximation of the sample to the</v>

525
00:29:04.001 --> 00:29:06.520
<v Speaker 1>underlying population,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the actual population.</v>

526
00:29:06.730 --> 00:29:10.990
<v Speaker 1>And the less difference you have to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>between the groups in terms of magnitude</v>

527
00:29:10.991 --> 00:29:13.540
<v Speaker 1>for that to not be a consequence of</v>
<v Speaker 1>chance.</v>

528
00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:15.880
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you need to know three things when</v>

529
00:29:15.881 --> 00:29:20.230
<v Speaker 1>you're interpreting the straightforward</v>
<v Speaker 1>statistics that have to do with group</v>

530
00:29:20.231 --> 00:29:21.910
<v Speaker 1>differences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In psychology experiments,</v>

531
00:29:21.911 --> 00:29:23.710
<v Speaker 1>you need to know number one,</v>

532
00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:25.590
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

533
00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:29.070
<v Speaker 1>how big the sample is because the bigger</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sample,</v>

534
00:29:29.071 --> 00:29:32.970
<v Speaker 1>the smaller effect will be significant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to know how significant the</v>

535
00:29:32.971 --> 00:29:36.270
<v Speaker 1>effect is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the probability and you need to</v>

536
00:29:36.271 --> 00:29:40.470
<v Speaker 1>know a big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the effect is that's the effect size.</v>

537
00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:43.690
<v Speaker 1>And you can't know one of those things</v>
<v Speaker 1>without doing all three of them.</v>

538
00:29:43.691 --> 00:29:45.310
<v Speaker 1>So when you're interpreting and</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiment,</v>

539
00:29:45.311 --> 00:29:47.350
<v Speaker 1>you always need to know effect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>size,</v>

540
00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:52.570
<v Speaker 1>the probability that that effects sizes</v>
<v Speaker 1>due to chance and how many subjects</v>

541
00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:54.730
<v Speaker 1>there are in the experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

542
00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:58.090
<v Speaker 1>Because those things are related and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't interpret one of them in the</v>

543
00:29:58.091 --> 00:30:00.070
<v Speaker 1>absence of the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

544
00:30:00.071 --> 00:30:03.810
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all I'll show you I'm not,</v>

545
00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:05.580
<v Speaker 1>I should show you this prieto just</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

546
00:30:05.581 --> 00:30:07.830
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I can find this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might as well show it to you now.</v>

547
00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:12.570
<v Speaker 1>Creedal distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's it called?</v>

548
00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:14.820
<v Speaker 1>Animation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it'll show up.</v>

549
00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:15.723
<v Speaker 1>That would be lovely.</v>

550
00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:27.653
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's see.</v>

551
00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:30.060
<v Speaker 3>I haven't looked at this one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but statistics,</v>

552
00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:35.270
<v Speaker 3>the general distribution is a family of</v>
<v Speaker 3>continuous probability distributions.</v>

553
00:30:36.330 --> 00:30:39.630
<v Speaker 3>It is often use to model the towns of</v>
<v Speaker 3>another distribution.</v>

554
00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:43.410
<v Speaker 3>It is specified when three parameters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>location,</v>

555
00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:45.180
<v Speaker 3>scale,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and shape.</v>

556
00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:47.690
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm city specified.</v>

557
00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:51.540
<v Speaker 3>Plan the scale and nothing like an audio</v>
<v Speaker 3>or only video.</v>

558
00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:58.080
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's cycle physics.</v>

559
00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:00.243
<v Speaker 2>Animation.</v>

560
00:31:17.610 --> 00:31:18.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't find it.</v>

561
00:31:18.811 --> 00:31:20.440
<v Speaker 1>So I'll just tell you about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did he step?</v>

562
00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:21.353
<v Speaker 1>It'll work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

563
00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:22.710
<v Speaker 1>so you're playing monopoly.</v>

564
00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:24.263
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

565
00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:28.410
<v Speaker 1>Monopoly is an interesting game to some</v>
<v Speaker 1>degree,</v>

566
00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:33.210
<v Speaker 1>but one of the rules in monopoly is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a finite number of properties</v>

567
00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:35.730
<v Speaker 1>and a finite amount of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

568
00:31:35.731 --> 00:31:37.650
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an that's an important feature</v>

569
00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:42.090
<v Speaker 1>because what that means is that there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be winners and losers if you</v>

570
00:31:42.091 --> 00:31:43.560
<v Speaker 1>played the game long enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

571
00:31:43.561 --> 00:31:45.480
<v Speaker 1>That's what it absolutely entails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

572
00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:48.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>economists argue about whether or not</v>

573
00:31:48.001 --> 00:31:53.001
<v Speaker 1>the economy is a zero sum game where</v>
<v Speaker 1>there has to be winners and losers or</v>

574
00:31:53.251 --> 00:31:57.540
<v Speaker 1>whether it's more infinite game because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount of money continually</v>

575
00:31:57.541 --> 00:31:58.590
<v Speaker 1>increases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

576
00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:00.990
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the amount of money you continually</v>

577
00:32:00.991 --> 00:32:03.210
<v Speaker 1>increases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not obvious that anybody has to be</v>

578
00:32:03.211 --> 00:32:04.350
<v Speaker 1>poor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

579
00:32:04.351 --> 00:32:06.930
<v Speaker 1>So here's what happens in monopoly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So first of all,</v>

580
00:32:06.931 --> 00:32:08.490
<v Speaker 1>you all started out with the same amount</v>
<v Speaker 1>of money,</v>

581
00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:10.110
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's fair.</v>

582
00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:11.730
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then what do you do?</v>

583
00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:14.430
<v Speaker 1>You shake the dice and he make some</v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions.</v>

584
00:32:14.431 --> 00:32:18.930
<v Speaker 1>And so it's not a bad model for life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dice shaking is the random element.</v>

585
00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:21.420
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens to you in your life is</v>

586
00:32:21.421 --> 00:32:24.780
<v Speaker 1>going to be a reasonable chunk of</v>
<v Speaker 1>random,</v>

587
00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:25.681
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

588
00:32:25.681 --> 00:32:28.860
<v Speaker 1>because you can be struck by illnesses</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a family member can,</v>

589
00:32:28.861 --> 00:32:30.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's arbitrary things that are going</v>

590
00:32:30.281 --> 00:32:33.150
<v Speaker 1>to happen to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to know that because you have</v>

591
00:32:33.151 --> 00:32:37.650
<v Speaker 1>to think when something bad happens to</v>
<v Speaker 1>you about whether or not that was just</v>

592
00:32:37.651 --> 00:32:42.410
<v Speaker 1>random or whether you it and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of horrible to think that it's</v>

593
00:32:42.411 --> 00:32:44.840
<v Speaker 1>random because then you can't control</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

594
00:32:44.841 --> 00:32:47.480
<v Speaker 1>But on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it also means that sometimes when you</v>

595
00:32:47.481 --> 00:32:49.550
<v Speaker 1>fall down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually not your fault.</v>

596
00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:53.000
<v Speaker 1>It just happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you need to know that randomness</v>

597
00:32:53.001 --> 00:32:54.440
<v Speaker 1>has a fair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's,</v>

598
00:32:54.441 --> 00:32:57.560
<v Speaker 1>it's a nontrivial contribution to</v>
<v Speaker 1>people's life course.</v>

599
00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:00.950
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the dice represent the randomness now</v>

600
00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:04.250
<v Speaker 1>and then you make decisions about what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to do with your</v>

601
00:33:04.251 --> 00:33:05.450
<v Speaker 1>opportunities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

602
00:33:05.451 --> 00:33:10.451
<v Speaker 1>I think if you took 20 pete</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they had different levels of</v>

603
00:33:11.661 --> 00:33:16.340
<v Speaker 1>experience and expertise with monopoly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my suspicions are is that there are</v>

604
00:33:16.341 --> 00:33:20.330
<v Speaker 1>better players and that they would win</v>
<v Speaker 1>more often if you play them across time.</v>

605
00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:23.210
<v Speaker 1>That it's not purely a random game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although maybe it is.</v>

606
00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:26.990
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens is you basically start</v>

607
00:33:26.991 --> 00:33:27.860
<v Speaker 1>trading,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

608
00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:30.260
<v Speaker 1>You trade with the bank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you trade with the board and you trade</v>

609
00:33:30.261 --> 00:33:32.240
<v Speaker 1>with other players.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

610
00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:36.230
<v Speaker 1>and you do that randomly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what happens is that with each trade</v>

611
00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:39.530
<v Speaker 1>someone gains a bit more and someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>loses a bit more.</v>

612
00:33:39.531 --> 00:33:42.460
<v Speaker 1>But something always happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is as you gain more,</v>

613
00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:44.510
<v Speaker 1>your options increase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as you lose more,</v>

614
00:33:44.511 --> 00:33:46.340
<v Speaker 1>your options decrease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

615
00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:50.690
<v Speaker 1>So by the time you're down to $1,000 and</v>
<v Speaker 1>three properties and it's three quarters</v>

616
00:33:50.691 --> 00:33:53.240
<v Speaker 1>of the way through the game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you're in a whole,</v>

617
00:33:53.241 --> 00:33:55.850
<v Speaker 1>your heart [inaudible] it's very</v>
<v Speaker 1>unlikely that you're going to climb out</v>

618
00:33:55.851 --> 00:33:58.640
<v Speaker 1>of it because one little negative event</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll take you out of the gate.</v>

619
00:33:58.970 --> 00:34:01.910
<v Speaker 1>Now you know there's some trivial</v>
<v Speaker 1>probability that you'll get back into</v>

620
00:34:01.911 --> 00:34:04.370
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but everyone knows that sinking feeling</v>

621
00:34:04.371 --> 00:34:08.060
<v Speaker 1>that occurs when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just more or less baggage on the</v>

622
00:34:08.061 --> 00:34:08.894
<v Speaker 1>game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

623
00:34:09.650 --> 00:34:14.540
<v Speaker 1>But what happens to the other people is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that one of them starts to pull out way</v>

624
00:34:14.541 --> 00:34:18.020
<v Speaker 1>ahead and what happens as you continue</v>
<v Speaker 1>to run the game,</v>

625
00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:21.290
<v Speaker 1>we'll say for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the moment merely as a consequence</v>

626
00:34:21.291 --> 00:34:24.290
<v Speaker 1>of chance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone will end up with all the money</v>

627
00:34:24.291 --> 00:34:27.980
<v Speaker 1>in all the properties now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the importance of that can't be</v>

628
00:34:27.981 --> 00:34:30.740
<v Speaker 1>overstated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a non [inaudible] that's a non</v>

629
00:34:30.741 --> 00:34:31.730
<v Speaker 1>normal distribution.</v>

630
00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:35.630
<v Speaker 1>And although you won't hear about this</v>
<v Speaker 1>in psychology ever,</v>

631
00:34:35.631 --> 00:34:38.270
<v Speaker 1>I didn't understand this until like five</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

632
00:34:38.271 --> 00:34:40.970
<v Speaker 1>which is absolutely pathetic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's 10 years ago now.</v>

633
00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:44.840
<v Speaker 1>But because I was under the assumption</v>
<v Speaker 1>that almost everything that</v>

634
00:34:44.841 --> 00:34:47.900
<v Speaker 1>psychologists studied that was important</v>
<v Speaker 1>was normally distributed.</v>

635
00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:50.600
<v Speaker 1>That's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lots of things are distributed in a</v>

636
00:34:50.601 --> 00:34:52.700
<v Speaker 1>prieto distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

637
00:34:52.730 --> 00:34:57.500
<v Speaker 1>I think what happens is that you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>feedback loops developing,</v>

638
00:34:57.860 --> 00:34:59.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you fall,</v>

639
00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:04.430
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>fall increases because you're not as</v>

640
00:35:04.431 --> 00:35:06.920
<v Speaker 1>resilient and because things can take</v>
<v Speaker 1>you out faster.</v>

641
00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:10.250
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start to get poor,</v>

642
00:35:10.251 --> 00:35:14.300
<v Speaker 1>well then you don't eat quite as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're rushed off your feet more,</v>

643
00:35:14.301 --> 00:35:17.000
<v Speaker 1>so you're sick more often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then your income falls,</v>

644
00:35:17.090 --> 00:35:19.220
<v Speaker 1>then you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're either under severe financial</v>

645
00:35:19.221 --> 00:35:21.170
<v Speaker 1>stress or you have to move to a poor</v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood.</v>

646
00:35:21.171 --> 00:35:22.730
<v Speaker 1>And then if you move to a poor</v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood,</v>

647
00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:26.570
<v Speaker 1>the people around you aren't</v>
<v Speaker 1>characterized by as many opportunities,</v>

648
00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:26.900
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

649
00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:30.230
<v Speaker 1>And maybe it's rougher and so that makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>you more depressed and you can just see</v>

650
00:35:30.231 --> 00:35:33.290
<v Speaker 1>it's this and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on the other hand,</v>

651
00:35:33.291 --> 00:35:36.310
<v Speaker 1>if you're starting to climb up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get exactly the opposite phenomena,</v>

652
00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:39.870
<v Speaker 1>which is you start putting away some</v>
<v Speaker 1>money so you're more resilient to,</v>

653
00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:41.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>random economical occurrences.</v>

654
00:35:42.210 --> 00:35:46.560
<v Speaker 1>And as you'd become,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well for this argument,</v>

655
00:35:46.561 --> 00:35:48.720
<v Speaker 1>we'll just use wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you become wealthier,</v>

656
00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:50.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you move into better and better</v>

657
00:35:50.551 --> 00:35:53.670
<v Speaker 1>neighborhoods and then the people around</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have more and more opportunities to</v>

658
00:35:53.671 --> 00:35:57.450
<v Speaker 1>distribute and you can go like that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what happens to people.</v>

659
00:35:57.870 --> 00:36:02.520
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most people end up stacked down</v>

660
00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:07.740
<v Speaker 1>near the barely clinging to the edge of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world and of the prieto</v>

661
00:36:07.741 --> 00:36:09.180
<v Speaker 1>distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

662
00:36:09.181 --> 00:36:14.181
<v Speaker 1>when a huge part of our economic and</v>
<v Speaker 1>political discourse is really what to do</v>

663
00:36:15.211 --> 00:36:17.790
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's maybe two arguments.</v>

664
00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:20.850
<v Speaker 1>One is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should there be a burrito distribution</v>

665
00:36:20.851 --> 00:36:22.860
<v Speaker 1>at all?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shouldn't just be normally distributed,</v>

666
00:36:22.861 --> 00:36:25.020
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of what a middle class</v>
<v Speaker 1>society would look like,</v>

667
00:36:25.021 --> 00:36:27.840
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people have the average amount of</v>

668
00:36:27.841 --> 00:36:29.850
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some people who are maybe three</v>

669
00:36:29.851 --> 00:36:33.360
<v Speaker 1>or four standard deviations above the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean and there's some poor people and</v>

670
00:36:33.361 --> 00:36:37.140
<v Speaker 1>you just can't flatten it out more than</v>
<v Speaker 1>that because you'd end up with tyranny.</v>

671
00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:39.600
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause if you push a system,</v>

672
00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:42.510
<v Speaker 1>you can push a system to do anything you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want it to do.</v>

673
00:36:42.511 --> 00:36:46.800
<v Speaker 1>But as you deformant warp it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes more and more forced to</v>

674
00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:51.870
<v Speaker 1>regulated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the distribution of money isn't even</v>

675
00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:54.360
<v Speaker 1>close to a normal distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

676
00:36:54.361 --> 00:36:58.950
<v Speaker 1>if you take the top 1% of people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>have the money and you look at that</v>

677
00:36:58.951 --> 00:37:01.230
<v Speaker 1>distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a wild pareto distribution.</v>

678
00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:05.160
<v Speaker 1>And if you take the top 0.1% and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at that distribution,</v>

679
00:37:05.310 --> 00:37:07.200
<v Speaker 1>it's a wild pareto distribution.</v>

680
00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:11.820
<v Speaker 1>And so like it's 1% of the 1% who own</v>
<v Speaker 1>half of what the 1% will,</v>

681
00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:14.940
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it just doesn't end until you get to</v>

682
00:37:14.941 --> 00:37:16.320
<v Speaker 1>the richest person in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

683
00:37:16.321 --> 00:37:20.490
<v Speaker 1>And then they own something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the richest person in the world probably</v>

684
00:37:20.491 --> 00:37:22.560
<v Speaker 1>has $100 billion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be my guess.</v>

685
00:37:22.561 --> 00:37:25.230
<v Speaker 1>It might be potent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

686
00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:29.670
<v Speaker 1>but $100 billion is a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very large amount of money and so</v>

687
00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:36.200
<v Speaker 1>he's like 50 standard deviations above</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mean way where it's not even</v>

688
00:37:38.071 --> 00:37:41.460
<v Speaker 1>imaginable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you might say,</v>

689
00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:46.230
<v Speaker 1>should it be normally distributed and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of the ideal ideal democratic</v>

690
00:37:46.231 --> 00:37:49.500
<v Speaker 1>socialist society in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you might say,</v>

691
00:37:49.501 --> 00:37:53.460
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps not because maybe you want an</v>

692
00:37:53.461 --> 00:37:57.360
<v Speaker 1>undue proportion of the rewards to go to</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are unduly productive.</v>

693
00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:02.730
<v Speaker 1>Now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think you have a huge advantage,</v>

694
00:38:02.731 --> 00:38:04.830
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be born into money,</v>

695
00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:08.250
<v Speaker 1>but it actually turns out that in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>United States anyways,</v>

696
00:38:08.251 --> 00:38:12.690
<v Speaker 1>if you had to choose between being born</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the 95th percentile for wealth or the</v>

697
00:38:12.691 --> 00:38:16.920
<v Speaker 1>95th percentile for intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be better off at the age of 40 if</v>

698
00:38:16.921 --> 00:38:20.610
<v Speaker 1>you were born at the 95th percentile for</v>
<v Speaker 1>education or for intelligence.</v>

699
00:38:21.090 --> 00:38:23.220
<v Speaker 1>So wealth matters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't matter as much or</v>

700
00:38:23.221 --> 00:38:25.680
<v Speaker 1>hereditary wealth matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it doesn't matter as much as people</v>

701
00:38:25.681 --> 00:38:28.470
<v Speaker 1>think it matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's partly because you actually</v>

702
00:38:28.471 --> 00:38:31.490
<v Speaker 1>can get ahead in a functional society if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're smart and hardworking.</v>

703
00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:35.410
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're in a corrupt society and work</v>

704
00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:37.870
<v Speaker 1>just makes you into a sheep to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>fleeced,</v>

705
00:38:37.871 --> 00:38:39.910
<v Speaker 1>well then it's obviously better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude born rich.</v>

706
00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:45.190
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say the advantage to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>booked to being born is proportional to</v>

707
00:38:45.191 --> 00:38:48.460
<v Speaker 1>the amount of corruption in the society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's a corrupt society,</v>

708
00:38:48.490 --> 00:38:49.930
<v Speaker 1>it's your only hope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it isn't,</v>

709
00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:52.780
<v Speaker 1>it might not even necessarily be all</v>
<v Speaker 1>that good for,</v>

710
00:38:52.781 --> 00:38:54.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

711
00:38:54.610 --> 00:38:58.000
<v Speaker 1>what's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The best investor in the world,</v>

712
00:38:58.001 --> 00:39:02.530
<v Speaker 1>the richest investor in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whose name his name escapes me.</v>

713
00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:05.290
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>

714
00:39:05.291 --> 00:39:05.711
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

715
00:39:05.711 --> 00:39:07.660
<v Speaker 1>He's not leaving very much money to his</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids.</v>

716
00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:10.450
<v Speaker 1>Like it would be a lot by our standards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by his standards,</v>

717
00:39:10.451 --> 00:39:11.081
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

718
00:39:11.081 --> 00:39:14.920
<v Speaker 1>the pennies in the bottom of this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>ashtray in his car.</v>

719
00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:17.230
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason he doesn't want to leave</v>

720
00:39:17.231 --> 00:39:19.780
<v Speaker 1>them a lot of money is because he</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually thinks it deprives them of</v>

721
00:39:19.781 --> 00:39:22.720
<v Speaker 1>necessity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And depriving someone of necessity is</v>

722
00:39:22.721 --> 00:39:24.520
<v Speaker 1>not really a very good thing because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

723
00:39:24.550 --> 00:39:28.720
<v Speaker 1>partly the reason you're motivated isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>only because you want some good things</v>

724
00:39:28.721 --> 00:39:31.180
<v Speaker 1>to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might also be because you know,</v>

725
00:39:31.181 --> 00:39:33.610
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you better watch out and get your life</v>

726
00:39:33.611 --> 00:39:35.710
<v Speaker 1>together or you'll get cut off at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>knees and you know,</v>

727
00:39:35.711 --> 00:39:37.930
<v Speaker 1>if you're too protective then that all</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes away.</v>

728
00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:41.170
<v Speaker 1>And so it isn't necessarily obvious that</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for the best.</v>

729
00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:43.510
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then you might think,</v>

730
00:39:43.511 --> 00:39:45.070
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should have a modified prieto</v>

731
00:39:45.071 --> 00:39:49.480
<v Speaker 1>distribution because that'll enable</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are hyper productive to be</v>

732
00:39:49.481 --> 00:39:50.350
<v Speaker 1>rewarded for it.</v>

733
00:39:50.350 --> 00:39:54.250
<v Speaker 1>But more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have a prieto distribution</v>

734
00:39:54.251 --> 00:39:57.670
<v Speaker 1>in your society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there aren't individuals who amass large</v>

735
00:39:57.671 --> 00:40:00.790
<v Speaker 1>pools of capital.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it's very difficult for there</v>

736
00:40:00.791 --> 00:40:03.670
<v Speaker 1>to be investment taking place because</v>
<v Speaker 1>some things are really expensive.</v>

737
00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:06.610
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to build a fabrication plant</v>

738
00:40:06.611 --> 00:40:09.040
<v Speaker 1>to make computer chips,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need about $4 billion.</v>

739
00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:13.810
<v Speaker 1>And it isn't really all that useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me that it wouldn't be all</v>

740
00:40:13.811 --> 00:40:17.470
<v Speaker 1>that useful if the only institution who</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever had that much money was the</v>

741
00:40:17.471 --> 00:40:19.240
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that would mean that the</v>

742
00:40:19.241 --> 00:40:21.670
<v Speaker 1>government would have to be the lead</v>
<v Speaker 1>investor in everything.</v>

743
00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:23.820
<v Speaker 1>And that's just not tenable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

744
00:40:23.830 --> 00:40:26.740
<v Speaker 1>you're going to replace all the venture</v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalists with government agents,</v>

745
00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:28.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>government workers,</v>

746
00:40:28.330 --> 00:40:32.230
<v Speaker 1>that's not going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you do want there to be fairly large</v>

747
00:40:32.231 --> 00:40:36.360
<v Speaker 1>pools of capital and you can also make a</v>
<v Speaker 1>case that you don't want all the power</v>

748
00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:37.240
<v Speaker 1>centralized.</v>

749
00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:39.400
<v Speaker 1>And so if you take wealth away from</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

750
00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:42.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean high levels of wealth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens is again,</v>

751
00:40:42.161 --> 00:40:44.890
<v Speaker 1>you start to centralize power in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>government because it's the only</v>

752
00:40:44.891 --> 00:40:48.580
<v Speaker 1>institution that's large enough to wield</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of clout.</v>

753
00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:50.980
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they say in the u s that most</v>

754
00:40:50.981 --> 00:40:54.880
<v Speaker 1>billionaires now are self made and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you might think,</v>

755
00:40:54.881 --> 00:40:58.540
<v Speaker 1>well if someone is capable parceling out</v>
<v Speaker 1>the crux,</v>

756
00:40:59.350 --> 00:41:03.700
<v Speaker 1>there's always going to be crooks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If someone is capable of generating $1</v>

757
00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:07.000
<v Speaker 1>billion by the time they're 40 it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>conceivable that that's the sort of</v>

758
00:41:07.001 --> 00:41:11.110
<v Speaker 1>person you want to have that much money</v>
<v Speaker 1>because obviously they know what to do</v>

759
00:41:11.111 --> 00:41:11.681
<v Speaker 1>with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

760
00:41:11.681 --> 00:41:13.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's easy to waste money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do that.</v>

761
00:41:13.691 --> 00:41:17.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've seen people blow through $3</v>
<v Speaker 1>million in two years with no problem.</v>

762
00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:21.040
<v Speaker 1>Like you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can distribute money if you're not</v>

763
00:41:21.041 --> 00:41:25.080
<v Speaker 1>careful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like like snow melting in your hands.</v>

764
00:41:25.090 --> 00:41:27.160
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to keep it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to use it.</v>

765
00:41:27.161 --> 00:41:30.430
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to invest it properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's certainly possible that you</v>

766
00:41:30.431 --> 00:41:33.800
<v Speaker 1>want fairly large pools of capital</v>
<v Speaker 1>distributed in the society.</v>

767
00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:34.130
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

768
00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:36.830
<v Speaker 4>there are multiple points of power,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

769
00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:41.000
<v Speaker 4>but you could still argue about exactly</v>
<v Speaker 4>what sort of premium distribution you'd</v>

770
00:41:41.001 --> 00:41:42.740
<v Speaker 4>want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's some good demonstrations in</v>

771
00:41:42.741 --> 00:41:44.320
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the u s okay,</v>

772
00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:46.160
<v Speaker 4>I can show you that too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a good one.</v>

773
00:41:55.690 --> 00:41:56.523
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

774
00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:59.320
<v Speaker 4>There's a chart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw it recently.</v>

775
00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:04.420
<v Speaker 4>I can't get out of a Harvard business</v>
<v Speaker 4>professor and economist ask more than</v>

776
00:42:04.421 --> 00:42:09.421
<v Speaker 4>5,000 Americans how they thought wealth</v>
<v Speaker 4>is distributed in the United States.</v>

777
00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:12.880
<v Speaker 4>This is what they said.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They thought it was dividing the country</v>

778
00:42:12.881 --> 00:42:15.790
<v Speaker 4>into five rep groups at the top,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bottom and middle,</v>

779
00:42:15.791 --> 00:42:19.720
<v Speaker 4>three 20% groups.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They ask people how they thought the</v>

780
00:42:19.721 --> 00:42:23.530
<v Speaker 4>wealth in this country was divided.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then he asked them what they thought was</v>

781
00:42:23.531 --> 00:42:28.531
<v Speaker 4>the ideal distribution and 92% that's at</v>
<v Speaker 4>least nine out of 10 of them said it</v>

782
00:42:29.711 --> 00:42:32.680
<v Speaker 4>should be more like this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In other words,</v>

783
00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:35.080
<v Speaker 4>more equitable than they think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

784
00:42:35.081 --> 00:42:38.170
<v Speaker 4>that fact is telling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>admittedly the notion that most</v>

785
00:42:38.171 --> 00:42:41.680
<v Speaker 4>Americans know that the system is</v>
<v Speaker 4>already skewed unfairly,</v>

786
00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:46.540
<v Speaker 4>but what's most interesting to me is the</v>
<v Speaker 4>reality compared to our perception.</v>

787
00:42:47.350 --> 00:42:52.350
<v Speaker 4>The ideal is as far removed from our</v>
<v Speaker 4>perception of reality as the actual</v>

788
00:42:52.481 --> 00:42:56.170
<v Speaker 4>distribution is from what we think</v>
<v Speaker 4>exists in this country.</v>

789
00:42:56.740 --> 00:43:00.430
<v Speaker 4>So ignore the ideal for a moment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's what we think it is.</v>

790
00:43:00.431 --> 00:43:04.180
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and here is the actual distribution.</v>

791
00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:09.520
<v Speaker 4>Shockingly skewed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not only do the bottom 20% and the next</v>

792
00:43:09.521 --> 00:43:14.521
<v Speaker 4>20% the bottom 40% of Americans barely</v>
<v Speaker 4>have any of the wealth.</v>

793
00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:17.470
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's hard to even see them on the chart,</v>

794
00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:21.820
<v Speaker 4>but the top 1% has more of the country's</v>
<v Speaker 4>wealth.</v>

795
00:43:22.090 --> 00:43:27.090
<v Speaker 4>Then nine out of 10 Americans believed</v>
<v Speaker 4>the entire top 20% should have</v>

796
00:43:28.030 --> 00:43:31.300
<v Speaker 4>mindblowing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but let's look at it another way because</v>

797
00:43:31.450 --> 00:43:33.850
<v Speaker 4>I find this chart kind of difficult to</v>
<v Speaker 4>wrap my head around.</v>

798
00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:37.840
<v Speaker 4>Instead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's reduce the 311 million Americans</v>

799
00:43:37.841 --> 00:43:40.540
<v Speaker 4>too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just to representative 100 people.</v>

800
00:43:40.990 --> 00:43:43.360
<v Speaker 4>Make it simple.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here they are,</v>

801
00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:45.190
<v Speaker 4>teachers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>coaches,</v>

802
00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:47.320
<v Speaker 4>firefighters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>construction workers,</v>

803
00:43:47.530 --> 00:43:48.670
<v Speaker 4>engineers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>doctors,</v>

804
00:43:48.671 --> 00:43:50.680
<v Speaker 4>lawyers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some investment bankers,</v>

805
00:43:50.681 --> 00:43:52.270
<v Speaker 4>a CEO,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe a celebrity,</v>

806
00:43:52.271 --> 00:43:55.670
<v Speaker 4>or now let's line them up according to</v>
<v Speaker 4>their wealth course,</v>

807
00:43:55.690 --> 00:43:58.060
<v Speaker 4>people on the left wealthiest on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

808
00:43:58.270 --> 00:43:59.410
<v Speaker 4>just a steady row.</v>

809
00:43:59.410 --> 00:44:03.760
<v Speaker 4>Folks based on their net worth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's other complicated before based</v>

810
00:44:03.761 --> 00:44:08.761
<v Speaker 4>on which 20% quintile they fall into.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now let's reduce the total wealth of the</v>

811
00:44:08.831 --> 00:44:13.831
<v Speaker 4>United States,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was roughly $54 trillion in 2009</v>

812
00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:19.260
<v Speaker 4>to this symbolic pile of cash and let's</v>
<v Speaker 4>distribute it among our 100 Americans.</v>

813
00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:22.570
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's socialism.</v>

814
00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:25.060
<v Speaker 4>All the wealth of the country</v>
<v Speaker 4>distributed equally.</v>

815
00:44:25.570 --> 00:44:29.080
<v Speaker 4>We all know that won't work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We need to encourage people to work and</v>

816
00:44:29.081 --> 00:44:32.100
<v Speaker 4>work hard to achieve that good American</v>
<v Speaker 4>dream.</v>

817
00:44:32.101 --> 00:44:37.101
<v Speaker 4>Keep our country moving forward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So here's that ideal.</v>

818
00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:40.230
<v Speaker 4>We asked everyone about something like</v>
<v Speaker 4>this curve.</v>

819
00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:43.470
<v Speaker 4>This isn't too bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've got some incentive as the</v>

820
00:44:43.471 --> 00:44:48.360
<v Speaker 4>wealthiest folks are now about 10 to 20</v>
<v Speaker 4>times better off than the poorest</v>

821
00:44:48.361 --> 00:44:50.310
<v Speaker 4>Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but hey,</v>

822
00:44:50.370 --> 00:44:52.440
<v Speaker 4>even the poor folks aren't actually</v>
<v Speaker 4>poor.</v>

823
00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:55.890
<v Speaker 4>Since the poverty line stayed almost</v>
<v Speaker 4>entirely off the chart.</v>

824
00:44:56.310 --> 00:45:01.310
<v Speaker 4>We have a super healthy middleclass of a</v>
<v Speaker 4>smooth transition into wealth and yes,</v>

825
00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:04.740
<v Speaker 4>Republicans and Democrats alive chose</v>
<v Speaker 4>this curve.</v>

826
00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:10.190
<v Speaker 4>Nine out of 10 people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>92% said this was a nice ideal</v>

827
00:45:10.381 --> 00:45:13.470
<v Speaker 4>distribution of America's wealth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but let's move on.</v>

828
00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:18.540
<v Speaker 4>This is what people think America's</v>
<v Speaker 4>wealth distribution actually looks like</v>

829
00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:22.230
<v Speaker 4>that was equitable clearly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but for me,</v>

830
00:45:22.530 --> 00:45:25.530
<v Speaker 4>even this still looks pretty great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

831
00:45:25.531 --> 00:45:29.760
<v Speaker 4>the poorest 20 to 30% are starting to</v>
<v Speaker 4>separate quite a lot compared to the</v>

832
00:45:29.761 --> 00:45:34.650
<v Speaker 4>ideal in the middle class is certainly</v>
<v Speaker 4>struggling more than they were while the</v>

833
00:45:34.651 --> 00:45:38.280
<v Speaker 4>rich and wealthy or making roughly a</v>
<v Speaker 4>hundred times that of the chorus</v>

834
00:45:38.290 --> 00:45:42.540
<v Speaker 4>Americans in about 10 times that of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>still healthy middle class.</v>

835
00:45:43.110 --> 00:45:46.230
<v Speaker 4>Sadly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this isn't even close to the reality.</v>

836
00:45:47.370 --> 00:45:50.160
<v Speaker 4>Here is the actual distribution of</v>
<v Speaker 4>wealth in America.</v>

837
00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:54.180
<v Speaker 4>The poorest of Americans don't even</v>
<v Speaker 4>register.</v>

838
00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:59.310
<v Speaker 4>They're down to pocket change and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>middle class is barely distinguishable</v>

839
00:45:59.311 --> 00:46:01.380
<v Speaker 4>from the poor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>

840
00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:06.470
<v Speaker 4>even the rich between the top 10 and 20</v>
<v Speaker 4>percentile are worse off only the top</v>

841
00:46:06.781 --> 00:46:08.040
<v Speaker 4>10% or better off.</v>

842
00:46:08.250 --> 00:46:11.700
<v Speaker 4>And how much better on so much better</v>
<v Speaker 4>off at the top.</v>

843
00:46:11.701 --> 00:46:16.701
<v Speaker 4>Two to 5% are actually off the chart at</v>
<v Speaker 4>this scale and the top 1% this guy,</v>

844
00:46:20.310 --> 00:46:22.830
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his stack of money stretches 10 times</v>

845
00:46:22.831 --> 00:46:27.300
<v Speaker 4>higher than we can show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's his stack of catch restaffed all</v>

846
00:46:27.301 --> 00:46:31.200
<v Speaker 4>by itself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is the top 1% we've been hearing so</v>

847
00:46:31.201 --> 00:46:35.910
<v Speaker 4>much about so much green in his pockets</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I have to give him a whole new</v>

848
00:46:35.911 --> 00:46:38.790
<v Speaker 4>column of his own because he won't fit</v>
<v Speaker 4>on my chart.</v>

849
00:46:39.210 --> 00:46:43.020
<v Speaker 4>1% of America has 40% of all the</v>
<v Speaker 4>nations.</v>

850
00:46:43.021 --> 00:46:47.100
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the bottom 8% eight out of every 10</v>

851
00:46:47.101 --> 00:46:52.101
<v Speaker 4>people or 80 out of these hundred only</v>
<v Speaker 4>has 7% between them,</v>

852
00:46:53.130 --> 00:46:56.910
<v Speaker 4>and this has only gotten worse in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>last 20 to 30 years.</v>

853
00:46:57.150 --> 00:47:02.150
<v Speaker 4>While the richest 1% take home almost a</v>
<v Speaker 4>quarter of the national income today in</v>

854
00:47:02.851 --> 00:47:07.851
<v Speaker 4>1976 they took home only 9% meaning</v>
<v Speaker 4>their share of income is nearly tripled</v>

855
00:47:09.150 --> 00:47:13.860
<v Speaker 4>in the last 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The top 1% half the country stocks,</v>

856
00:47:13.861 --> 00:47:18.861
<v Speaker 4>bonds and mutual funds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the bottom 50% of Americans and only</v>

857
00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:23.760
<v Speaker 4>half a percent of these investments,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which means they aren't investing,</v>

858
00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:26.970
<v Speaker 4>they're just scraping by.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm sure many of these wealthy</v>

859
00:47:26.971 --> 00:47:31.630
<v Speaker 4>people have worked very hard in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but do you really believe that the CEO</v>

860
00:47:31.690 --> 00:47:36.690
<v Speaker 4>is working 380 times harder?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is average employee and if not as</v>

861
00:47:37.331 --> 00:47:38.320
<v Speaker 4>lowest paid employee.</v>

862
00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:41.330
<v Speaker 1>See that's the one error I think that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this video,</v>

863
00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:46.010
<v Speaker 1>how hard you work is irrelevant in terms</v>
<v Speaker 1>of how much money are almost irrelevant</v>

864
00:47:46.011 --> 00:47:48.920
<v Speaker 1>in terms of how much money you generate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

865
00:47:48.921 --> 00:47:51.350
<v Speaker 1>Because obviously the people who work</v>
<v Speaker 1>really hard,</v>

866
00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:55.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean who works hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those guys that are digging holes out in</v>

867
00:47:55.041 --> 00:47:58.520
<v Speaker 1>the road in the winter there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're working hard,</v>

868
00:47:59.060 --> 00:47:59.893
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

869
00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:05.450
<v Speaker 1>you're not rewarded for the physical</v>
<v Speaker 1>effort that you put in or rarely there's</v>

870
00:48:05.451 --> 00:48:07.490
<v Speaker 1>some association,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not very much.</v>

871
00:48:07.491 --> 00:48:12.110
<v Speaker 1>And so it isn't whether or not the CEO</v>
<v Speaker 1>works 380 times harder.</v>

872
00:48:12.350 --> 00:48:17.350
<v Speaker 1>It's whether or not their productivity</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be leveraged enough to justify that</v>

873
00:48:17.631 --> 00:48:18.464
<v Speaker 1>level of,</v>

874
00:48:19.390 --> 00:48:20.990
<v Speaker 2>uh huh</v>

875
00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:24.470
<v Speaker 1>compensation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you can make arguments on both sides</v>

876
00:48:24.471 --> 00:48:27.470
<v Speaker 1>of that and it depends a lot on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>industry and on the individual and all</v>

877
00:48:27.471 --> 00:48:29.210
<v Speaker 1>of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't want to,</v>

878
00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:31.640
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to reduce this argument</v>
<v Speaker 1>to one of hard work.</v>

879
00:48:31.641 --> 00:48:34.310
<v Speaker 1>It's not appropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's too unsophisticated,</v>

880
00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:45.550
<v Speaker 4>but the average,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the average worker needs to work more</v>

881
00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:49.430
<v Speaker 4>than a month to earn with the CEO makes</v>
<v Speaker 4>him one hour.</v>

882
00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:54.080
<v Speaker 4>We certainly don't have to go all the</v>
<v Speaker 4>way to socialism to find somebody that</v>

883
00:48:54.081 --> 00:48:58.250
<v Speaker 4>is fair for hardworking Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't even have to achieve what most</v>

884
00:48:58.251 --> 00:49:03.251
<v Speaker 4>of us consider might be ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All we need to do is wake up and realize</v>

885
00:49:04.250 --> 00:49:08.720
<v Speaker 4>that the reality in this country is not</v>
<v Speaker 4>at all what we think it is.</v>

886
00:49:10.530 --> 00:49:11.363
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

887
00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:14.930
<v Speaker 1>so there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a two minute explanation for</v>

888
00:49:14.931 --> 00:49:18.440
<v Speaker 1>trump and sanders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>

889
00:49:18.441 --> 00:49:21.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm dead serious about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm dead serious about that.</v>

890
00:49:21.021 --> 00:49:23.000
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the right wing working class</v>

891
00:49:23.001 --> 00:49:24.710
<v Speaker 1>right wing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think they'd been absolutely</v>

892
00:49:24.711 --> 00:49:27.690
<v Speaker 1>screwed over and they have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you know,</v>

893
00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:29.960
<v Speaker 1>the left thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there's way too much power</v>

894
00:49:29.961 --> 00:49:32.840
<v Speaker 1>concentrated at the top and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution would be the answer.</v>

895
00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:35.510
<v Speaker 1>The problem is is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is the real problem,</v>

896
00:49:36.110 --> 00:49:38.570
<v Speaker 1>it's not that he's figured out how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>distribute the money.</v>

897
00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:42.230
<v Speaker 1>Like first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a natural proclivity.</v>

898
00:49:42.231 --> 00:49:44.870
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can map model it with laws of</v>

899
00:49:44.871 --> 00:49:48.140
<v Speaker 1>physics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a natural proclivity of money to</v>

900
00:49:48.141 --> 00:49:51.860
<v Speaker 1>rate rank itself out like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that happens in every culture.</v>

901
00:49:52.250 --> 00:49:54.710
<v Speaker 1>Now you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you can modify the steepness,</v>

902
00:49:54.830 --> 00:49:57.920
<v Speaker 1>but it's not easy to figure out how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know when there's a bunch of</v>

903
00:49:57.921 --> 00:50:01.250
<v Speaker 1>problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's a bunch of problems that</v>

904
00:50:01.251 --> 00:50:03.590
<v Speaker 1>are associated with the more dim witted</v>
<v Speaker 1>solutions.</v>

905
00:50:03.590 --> 00:50:06.710
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of people think that poverty is</v>

906
00:50:06.711 --> 00:50:09.830
<v Speaker 1>caused by lack of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's really not a very</v>

907
00:50:09.831 --> 00:50:12.740
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated theory because there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of things that cause poverty.</v>

908
00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:16.250
<v Speaker 1>Low Iq causes poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not saying that all poor people</v>

909
00:50:16.251 --> 00:50:18.380
<v Speaker 1>have low Iq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that would be stupid.</v>

910
00:50:18.770 --> 00:50:22.130
<v Speaker 1>But obviously if you have an Iq of 80</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can barely read,</v>

911
00:50:22.131 --> 00:50:25.070
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you're going to end</v>
<v Speaker 1>up poor is pretty damn hot,</v>

912
00:50:25.490 --> 00:50:26.180
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

913
00:50:26.180 --> 00:50:28.820
<v Speaker 1>so you've got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know it's about 10% of the</v>

914
00:50:28.821 --> 00:50:32.210
<v Speaker 1>population who has an Iq less than 80</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot of people.</v>

915
00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:35.810
<v Speaker 1>And so they're not literate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you think about what they can do,</v>

916
00:50:36.110 --> 00:50:37.880
<v Speaker 1>they can't run computers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking.</v>

917
00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:39.980
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then there's people who are ill,</v>

918
00:50:40.610 --> 00:50:42.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of them.</v>

919
00:50:42.830 --> 00:50:46.250
<v Speaker 1>Then there's people who are alone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a big problem because they're</v>

920
00:50:46.251 --> 00:50:48.050
<v Speaker 1>one step away from disaster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

921
00:50:48.050 --> 00:50:50.750
<v Speaker 1>If you're alone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's people who have alcohol and</v>

922
00:50:50.751 --> 00:50:53.060
<v Speaker 1>drug problems and people was screwed up</v>
<v Speaker 1>families.</v>

923
00:50:53.061 --> 00:50:55.460
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can go on and on to add up the</v>

924
00:50:55.461 --> 00:51:00.461
<v Speaker 1>reasons that people fall off the edge of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world and money won't scratch the</v>

925
00:51:00.741 --> 00:51:02.960
<v Speaker 1>surface for many of those problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For addiction,</v>

926
00:51:02.961 --> 00:51:06.200
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now maybe spending on programs that</v>

927
00:51:06.201 --> 00:51:07.940
<v Speaker 1>would remediate addiction would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>useful.</v>

928
00:51:07.941 --> 00:51:09.500
<v Speaker 1>But if you're an addict and you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>

929
00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:13.730
<v Speaker 1>that's not a good thing because all that</v>
<v Speaker 1>means is that you're going to just rent</v>

930
00:51:13.731 --> 00:51:15.260
<v Speaker 1>out the addiction until you run out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

931
00:51:15.830 --> 00:51:19.430
<v Speaker 1>And so you've got to have a more</v>
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated idea of what constitutes</v>

932
00:51:19.431 --> 00:51:21.860
<v Speaker 1>poverty before you can properly address</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

933
00:51:21.861 --> 00:51:25.250
<v Speaker 1>And then you also have to take into</v>
<v Speaker 1>account that a lot of what's driving</v>

934
00:51:25.251 --> 00:51:30.110
<v Speaker 1>people crazy say in places like the u s</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't the fact that there's absolute</v>

935
00:51:30.111 --> 00:51:32.390
<v Speaker 1>poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause there's abs actually not that much</v>

936
00:51:32.420 --> 00:51:37.420
<v Speaker 1>absolute poverty in the u s so if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>take the bottom 5% of the US population</v>

937
00:51:38.150 --> 00:51:41.480
<v Speaker 1>by world standards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing just fine.</v>

938
00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:43.850
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by American standards,</v>

939
00:51:43.851 --> 00:51:46.370
<v Speaker 1>they're doing terribly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you have the relative poverty</v>

940
00:51:46.371 --> 00:51:51.371
<v Speaker 1>problem and relative prob poverty drives</v>
<v Speaker 1>aggression.</v>

941
00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:55.520
<v Speaker 1>And so that's something that's really</v>
<v Speaker 1>worth knowing and this is something that</v>

942
00:51:55.521 --> 00:51:58.910
<v Speaker 1>the conservatives just haven't seemed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out as far as I can tell because</v>

943
00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:00.590
<v Speaker 1>the conservatives might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

944
00:52:00.591 --> 00:52:04.010
<v Speaker 1>you should let the money pile up on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>right hand side because you know the</v>

945
00:52:04.190 --> 00:52:07.730
<v Speaker 1>system is fair and smart people deserve</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be rewarded and so on and so forth.</v>

946
00:52:08.060 --> 00:52:11.960
<v Speaker 1>The problem is is that as that curve</v>
<v Speaker 1>increases in height,</v>

947
00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:16.040
<v Speaker 1>the probability that the surrounding</v>
<v Speaker 1>society is going to become violent</v>

948
00:52:16.250 --> 00:52:20.600
<v Speaker 1>starts to ratchet up tremendously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you see this in places like Central</v>

949
00:52:20.601 --> 00:52:24.200
<v Speaker 1>America where if you have money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to live in a bubble because if</v>

950
00:52:24.201 --> 00:52:25.670
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people will kidnap you.</v>

951
00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:29.060
<v Speaker 1>And so then you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well if you have $1 billion but you</v>

952
00:52:29.061 --> 00:52:31.850
<v Speaker 1>can't go outside except in a helicopter</v>
<v Speaker 1>with armed guards,</v>

953
00:52:31.940 --> 00:52:33.770
<v Speaker 1>how rich are you really?</v>

954
00:52:34.580 --> 00:52:35.220
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in in,</v>

955
00:52:35.220 --> 00:52:37.990
<v Speaker 1>in a place like Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in Montreal or Toronto.</v>

956
00:52:38.020 --> 00:52:42.170
<v Speaker 1>There's good examples is the city is so</v>
<v Speaker 1>damn safe that you don't have to live in</v>

957
00:52:42.171 --> 00:52:45.260
<v Speaker 1>your house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can live in the city and that's a</v>

958
00:52:45.261 --> 00:52:49.910
<v Speaker 1>massive economic like that should be</v>
<v Speaker 1>calculated as part of your net worth.</v>

959
00:52:50.090 --> 00:52:53.330
<v Speaker 1>And that's a consequence of reasonable</v>
<v Speaker 1>public programs.</v>

960
00:52:53.331 --> 00:52:56.330
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the distribution of income in Canada</v>

961
00:52:56.331 --> 00:52:58.700
<v Speaker 1>hasn't gotten to the point where things</v>
<v Speaker 1>are destabilizing.</v>

962
00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:02.900
<v Speaker 1>And so conservatives should be watching</v>
<v Speaker 1>out for that incredible</v>

963
00:53:02.901 --> 00:53:06.740
<v Speaker 1>disproportionality of income as much as</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone else if one of their prime</v>

964
00:53:06.741 --> 00:53:09.050
<v Speaker 1>concerns is to maintain social</v>
<v Speaker 1>stability.</v>

965
00:53:09.590 --> 00:53:11.810
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the problem,</v>

966
00:53:13.250 --> 00:53:17.210
<v Speaker 1>the problem that we haven't been able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>solve as a culture from an economic</v>

967
00:53:17.211 --> 00:53:21.980
<v Speaker 1>perspective is how to distribute money</v>
<v Speaker 1>down the prieto distribution in a way</v>

968
00:53:21.981 --> 00:53:25.160
<v Speaker 1>that actually works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's way harder than you think.</v>

969
00:53:25.710 --> 00:53:27.600
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

970
00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:32.370
<v Speaker 1>if you set up large social social</v>
<v Speaker 1>services institutions,</v>

971
00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:35.880
<v Speaker 1>governmental institutions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or charities even for that matter,</v>

972
00:53:35.881 --> 00:53:37.410
<v Speaker 1>the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the,</v>

973
00:53:37.590 --> 00:53:39.210
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

974
00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:42.510
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the baseline cost of the organizations</v>

975
00:53:42.511 --> 00:53:45.270
<v Speaker 1>is so damn high that hardly any of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>money ever gets to the people that it's</v>

976
00:53:45.271 --> 00:53:47.940
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be helping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's really the case with</v>

977
00:53:47.941 --> 00:53:51.450
<v Speaker 1>foreign aid in places like Africa where</v>
<v Speaker 1>the poor people virtually never did any</v>

978
00:53:51.451 --> 00:53:52.560
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

979
00:53:52.561 --> 00:53:55.440
<v Speaker 1>so</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

980
00:53:55.441 --> 00:54:00.030
<v Speaker 1>so you think a corporation spends about</v>
<v Speaker 1>95% of its time just ensuring that it</v>

981
00:54:00.031 --> 00:54:02.700
<v Speaker 1>survived,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it uses that much resources just to</v>

982
00:54:02.701 --> 00:54:05.160
<v Speaker 1>keep running.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You set up a charity or you know,</v>

983
00:54:05.161 --> 00:54:07.500
<v Speaker 1>a social welfare institution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get the same problem.</v>

984
00:54:07.830 --> 00:54:10.410
<v Speaker 1>All the money is eaten up by the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are running the institution.</v>

985
00:54:10.411 --> 00:54:11.910
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not being cynical about that.</v>

986
00:54:11.910 --> 00:54:12.960
<v Speaker 1>They have to live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

987
00:54:12.961 --> 00:54:15.480
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really expensive to hire someone.</v>

988
00:54:15.950 --> 00:54:17.400
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want someone qualified,</v>

989
00:54:17.730 --> 00:54:22.080
<v Speaker 1>if you pay them $50,000 that basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>costs you 100,000 because you have to</v>

990
00:54:22.081 --> 00:54:24.870
<v Speaker 1>give them an office and it has to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>light and heat and all of that.</v>

991
00:54:24.871 --> 00:54:26.790
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 employees,</v>

992
00:54:26.791 --> 00:54:30.210
<v Speaker 1>it's 1 million bucks already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're fundraising as a</v>

993
00:54:30.211 --> 00:54:34.380
<v Speaker 1>charity to just get past the point where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're surviving is almost impossible.</v>

994
00:54:34.650 --> 00:54:37.530
<v Speaker 1>And then there's little logistical</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficulties of actually distributing</v>

995
00:54:37.531 --> 00:54:39.210
<v Speaker 1>the money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How the hell do you do that?</v>

996
00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:43.020
<v Speaker 1>It's not easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finland is instituted a guaranteed</v>

997
00:54:43.021 --> 00:54:45.870
<v Speaker 1>minimum wage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>minimum salary per month.</v>

998
00:54:45.871 --> 00:54:46.681
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

999
00:54:46.681 --> 00:54:49.950
<v Speaker 1>and they're experimenting with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a small country and it's</v>

1000
00:54:49.951 --> 00:54:53.310
<v Speaker 1>relatively homogenous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more like a big city or a moderate</v>

1001
00:54:53.311 --> 00:54:56.040
<v Speaker 1>size city actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could think that the logistics</v>

1002
00:54:56.041 --> 00:54:57.420
<v Speaker 1>would be a lot more straight forward.</v>

1003
00:54:58.080 --> 00:54:59.490
<v Speaker 1>But anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1004
00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:01.800
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's actually a preview to some</v>

1005
00:55:01.801 --> 00:55:04.200
<v Speaker 1>degree of what we're going to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we get to conscientiousness.</v>

1006
00:55:04.201 --> 00:55:06.750
<v Speaker 1>But you do need to know these things</v>
<v Speaker 1>statistically and you have to,</v>

1007
00:55:07.260 --> 00:55:08.310
<v Speaker 1>you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1008
00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:11.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to understand what the</v>

1009
00:55:11.221 --> 00:55:13.710
<v Speaker 1>statistics are representing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1010
00:55:13.711 --> 00:55:17.160
<v Speaker 1>So people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned that there are gender</v>

1011
00:55:17.161 --> 00:55:20.310
<v Speaker 1>differences in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in personality and you know,</v>

1012
00:55:20.311 --> 00:55:22.890
<v Speaker 1>that's a very controversial claim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weirdly enough.</v>

1013
00:55:23.310 --> 00:55:24.900
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something that's always rather</v>

1014
00:55:24.901 --> 00:55:27.800
<v Speaker 1>shocked me that it is controversial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1015
00:55:29.490 --> 00:55:32.280
<v Speaker 1>this is from the Gender Equity Resource</v>
<v Speaker 1>Center at Berkeley.</v>

1016
00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:37.020
<v Speaker 1>Gender is a socially constructed system</v>
<v Speaker 1>of classification that describes</v>

1017
00:55:37.021 --> 00:55:39.600
<v Speaker 1>qualities of masculinity and femininity</v>
<v Speaker 1>to people.</v>

1018
00:55:40.050 --> 00:55:44.250
<v Speaker 1>Gender characteristics can change over</v>
<v Speaker 1>time and are different between cultures.</v>

1019
00:55:44.730 --> 00:55:45.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount,</v>

1020
00:55:45.811 --> 00:55:48.420
<v Speaker 1>the number of things that are wrong with</v>
<v Speaker 1>those two sentences is almost,</v>

1021
00:55:48.780 --> 00:55:51.510
<v Speaker 1>it would take about three hours to</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually point them out.</v>

1022
00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:52.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1023
00:55:53.130 --> 00:55:57.600
<v Speaker 1>the fact that gender characteristics can</v>
<v Speaker 1>change over time and are different</v>

1024
00:55:57.601 --> 00:56:01.440
<v Speaker 1>between cultures in no way implies that</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things are socially constructed.</v>

1025
00:56:02.190 --> 00:56:05.910
<v Speaker 1>It implies they partly socially</v>
<v Speaker 1>constructed at best.</v>

1026
00:56:05.911 --> 00:56:08.310
<v Speaker 1>But it also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it also indicates that some of the</v>

1027
00:56:08.311 --> 00:56:11.340
<v Speaker 1>reasons that things might change over</v>
<v Speaker 1>time and are different between cultures</v>

1028
00:56:11.341 --> 00:56:13.530
<v Speaker 1>could be biological.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's no,</v>

1029
00:56:13.590 --> 00:56:17.610
<v Speaker 1>there's no saying anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no a priori demonstration that</v>

1030
00:56:17.611 --> 00:56:19.470
<v Speaker 1>that's impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not impossible.</v>

1031
00:56:19.980 --> 00:56:23.040
<v Speaker 1>And gender is a socially constructed</v>
<v Speaker 1>system of classification.</v>

1032
00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:28.060
<v Speaker 1>Well actually no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that isn't what the dad does seem to</v>

1033
00:56:28.090 --> 00:56:29.920
<v Speaker 1>indicate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the best out of that,</v>

1034
00:56:29.921 --> 00:56:33.550
<v Speaker 1>I know on that or the Scandinavian</v>
<v Speaker 1>studies one personality and what we'll</v>

1035
00:56:33.551 --> 00:56:34.384
<v Speaker 1>take a look at them.</v>

1036
00:56:39.370 --> 00:56:40.203
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

1037
00:56:52.260 --> 00:56:53.220
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a good one.</v>

1038
00:56:53.221 --> 00:56:56.760
<v Speaker 1>So this is interactions with reach</v>
<v Speaker 1>rhesus monkeys in toys.</v>

1039
00:56:56.761 --> 00:57:01.110
<v Speaker 1>We compared the interactions of 34</v>
<v Speaker 1>rhesus monkeys living within 135 monkey</v>

1040
00:57:01.111 --> 00:57:03.870
<v Speaker 1>troop with human wheeled toys and plush</v>
<v Speaker 1>toys.</v>

1041
00:57:04.140 --> 00:57:06.810
<v Speaker 1>Male monkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like boys showed consistent and strong</v>

1042
00:57:06.811 --> 00:57:10.020
<v Speaker 1>preferences for wheel toys while female</v>
<v Speaker 1>monkeys,</v>

1043
00:57:10.021 --> 00:57:13.050
<v Speaker 1>like girls showed the fit greater</v>
<v Speaker 1>variability and preferences.</v>

1044
00:57:13.860 --> 00:57:16.260
<v Speaker 1>That's the magnitude of preference for</v>
<v Speaker 1>wheeled over.</v>

1045
00:57:16.261 --> 00:57:19.200
<v Speaker 1>Plush toys differed significantly</v>
<v Speaker 1>between males and females.</v>

1046
00:57:19.430 --> 00:57:22.920
<v Speaker 1>As similarities to human findings</v>
<v Speaker 1>demonstrate such preferences can develop</v>

1047
00:57:22.921 --> 00:57:27.921
<v Speaker 1>without explicit gender socialization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So exposure to prenatal life events,</v>

1048
00:57:29.421 --> 00:57:33.600
<v Speaker 1>stress is associated with masculinized</v>
<v Speaker 1>play behavior and girls.</v>

1049
00:57:34.410 --> 00:57:36.150
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was,</v>

1050
00:57:36.390 --> 00:57:37.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1051
00:57:37.380 --> 00:57:41.070
<v Speaker 1>an analysis of in utero exposure to</v>
<v Speaker 1>hormones.</v>

1052
00:57:41.071 --> 00:57:44.490
<v Speaker 1>Because one thing that seems to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

1053
00:57:44.610 --> 00:57:46.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is one of the many things that</v>

1054
00:57:46.681 --> 00:57:50.910
<v Speaker 1>contribute to the differences between</v>
<v Speaker 1>males and females is that the basic</v>

1055
00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:56.250
<v Speaker 1>human body phenotype is feminine.</v>

1056
00:57:56.460 --> 00:58:00.540
<v Speaker 1>So if you have x,</v>
<v Speaker 1>y chromosomes or xx chromosomes,</v>

1057
00:58:00.570 --> 00:58:03.150
<v Speaker 1>and you're not exposed to testosterone</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Utero,</v>

1058
00:58:03.210 --> 00:58:05.370
<v Speaker 1>you'll come out with a female</v>
<v Speaker 1>physiology.</v>

1059
00:58:05.940 --> 00:58:09.420
<v Speaker 1>So what happens is that in utero that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1060
00:58:09.630 --> 00:58:13.500
<v Speaker 1>the male embryo is masculinized by</v>
<v Speaker 1>testosterone,</v>

1061
00:58:13.530 --> 00:58:16.290
<v Speaker 1>no testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's also testosterone production for</v>

1062
00:58:16.291 --> 00:58:17.160
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1063
00:58:17.161 --> 00:58:21.540
<v Speaker 1>but there's more for the male babies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's some evidence that suggests</v>

1064
00:58:21.541 --> 00:58:26.541
<v Speaker 1>that the more testosterone that a fetus</v>
<v Speaker 1>is exposed to in Utero,</v>

1065
00:58:26.790 --> 00:58:31.790
<v Speaker 1>the more masculinized their cognitive</v>
<v Speaker 1>styles and toy preferences and behaviors</v>

1066
00:58:32.311 --> 00:58:34.290
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's also the case for females.</v>

1067
00:58:34.490 --> 00:58:37.020
<v Speaker 1>Like if the more they're exposed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>testosterone in Utero,</v>

1068
00:58:37.170 --> 00:58:40.590
<v Speaker 1>the more that's also the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what this particular study</v>

1069
00:58:40.980 --> 00:58:42.480
<v Speaker 1>showed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1070
00:58:45.470 --> 00:58:46.340
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

1071
00:58:46.341 --> 00:58:48.860
<v Speaker 1>this is Simon Baron Cohen's work he did</v>
<v Speaker 1>the work with,</v>

1072
00:58:48.861 --> 00:58:49.910
<v Speaker 1>with uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

1073
00:58:50.060 --> 00:58:52.040
<v Speaker 1>with fetal development and he showed</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1074
00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:56.120
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fetal testosterone is inversely</v>

1075
00:58:56.121 --> 00:58:59.510
<v Speaker 1>correlated with social behaviors such as</v>
<v Speaker 1>eye contact and infancy,</v>

1076
00:58:59.511 --> 00:59:03.650
<v Speaker 1>peer relations and preschoolers and</v>
<v Speaker 1>mentalistic interpretations of animate</v>

1077
00:59:03.651 --> 00:59:04.484
<v Speaker 1>motion,</v>

1078
00:59:05.860 --> 00:59:08.950
<v Speaker 1>male fetuses are exposed to higher</v>
<v Speaker 1>levels of testosterone and then our</v>

1079
00:59:08.951 --> 00:59:13.540
<v Speaker 1>female fetuses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So his theory actually is that autism is</v>

1080
00:59:13.541 --> 00:59:18.070
<v Speaker 1>the extreme end of masculinized</v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitive development because it's all</v>

1081
00:59:18.071 --> 00:59:21.010
<v Speaker 1>female oriented,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no peep people orientation at all.</v>

1082
00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:25.100
<v Speaker 1>And then the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the opposite end of the distribution,</v>

1083
00:59:25.101 --> 00:59:28.010
<v Speaker 1>he's associated with predisposition to</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychosis.</v>

1084
00:59:28.011 --> 00:59:30.860
<v Speaker 1>Although I that I find that part of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>theory weaker.</v>

1085
00:59:31.310 --> 00:59:32.900
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1086
00:59:33.210 --> 00:59:34.250
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows,</v>

1087
00:59:34.251 --> 00:59:37.040
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly a possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

1088
00:59:37.041 --> 00:59:39.830
<v Speaker 1>and I contact is one of the things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really lacking in people who are</v>

1089
00:59:39.831 --> 00:59:40.820
<v Speaker 1>autistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1090
00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:44.570
<v Speaker 1>he had an awful lot of social</v>
<v Speaker 1>information from observing the face and</v>

1091
00:59:44.571 --> 00:59:47.810
<v Speaker 1>you have specialized circuits for</v>
<v Speaker 1>pulling in emotional information from</v>

1092
00:59:47.811 --> 00:59:49.070
<v Speaker 1>face observation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1093
00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:51.290
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

1094
00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:52.993
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1095
01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:03.810
<v Speaker 1>UN indices of gender equality and</v>
<v Speaker 1>economic development are associated with</v>

1096
01:00:03.811 --> 01:00:06.000
<v Speaker 1>larger gender differences in</v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness,</v>

1097
01:00:06.001 --> 01:00:10.800
<v Speaker 1>but not an extroversion or neuroticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's happened in the Scandinavian</v>

1098
01:00:10.801 --> 01:00:13.230
<v Speaker 1>countries?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine that any given trade is a</v>

1099
01:00:13.231 --> 01:00:17.850
<v Speaker 1>combination of environmental variables</v>
<v Speaker 1>and genetic biological variables.</v>

1100
01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:20.280
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you tend to think of those things as</v>

1101
01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:23.880
<v Speaker 1>isolated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not weirdly enough,</v>

1102
01:00:24.390 --> 01:00:29.390
<v Speaker 1>the relationship between biological</v>
<v Speaker 1>determination and cultural determination</v>

1103
01:00:30.510 --> 01:00:33.930
<v Speaker 1>is determined by the culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a very strange thing.</v>

1104
01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:38.960
<v Speaker 1>So what I mean by that is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you are two years old and I threw you</v>

1105
01:00:40.351 --> 01:00:43.140
<v Speaker 1>in a box and did nothing but beat you</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyday for 10 years,</v>

1106
01:00:43.141 --> 01:00:46.260
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you would come out</v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeable is very low.</v>

1107
01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:47.840
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1108
01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:49.800
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the point I'm making is that you can</v>

1109
01:00:49.801 --> 01:00:54.270
<v Speaker 1>take an individual and if you put them</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a radical enough environment,</v>

1110
01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:56.010
<v Speaker 1>you can pretty much shift them where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1111
01:00:56.100 --> 01:00:57.060
<v Speaker 1>where you're going to shift.</v>

1112
01:00:57.150 --> 01:01:01.170
<v Speaker 1>Now the harder you want to shift them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more force it's going to take.</v>

1113
01:01:02.010 --> 01:01:02.611
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1114
01:01:02.611 --> 01:01:04.410
<v Speaker 1>like if you took a really agreeable</v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

1115
01:01:04.411 --> 01:01:09.411
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to be pretty malevolent to</v>
<v Speaker 1>set up the circumstances that would</v>

1116
01:01:09.721 --> 01:01:12.390
<v Speaker 1>really make them self centered in</v>
<v Speaker 1>predatory.</v>

1117
01:01:12.510 --> 01:01:17.250
<v Speaker 1>But I suspect you could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what happens in the Scandinavian</v>

1118
01:01:17.251 --> 01:01:20.820
<v Speaker 1>countries is that there's been a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>attempt to,</v>

1119
01:01:21.150 --> 01:01:26.130
<v Speaker 1>to flatten out the contribution of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>society on gender differences.</v>

1120
01:01:26.430 --> 01:01:29.790
<v Speaker 1>And so all that's happened is that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>biological differences have maximized.</v>

1121
01:01:30.330 --> 01:01:32.130
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because what you're really looking for</v>

1122
01:01:32.131 --> 01:01:35.730
<v Speaker 1>is his contribution for society to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a contribution.</v>

1123
01:01:35.731 --> 01:01:39.590
<v Speaker 1>There has to be different treatment for</v>
<v Speaker 1>men and women because otherwise this</v>

1124
01:01:39.591 --> 01:01:43.440
<v Speaker 1>society has no effect on the differences</v>
<v Speaker 1>between men and women obviously.</v>

1125
01:01:43.770 --> 01:01:46.830
<v Speaker 1>And then there's nothing left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But biological differences now there</v>

1126
01:01:46.831 --> 01:01:49.220
<v Speaker 1>could be no biological differences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1127
01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:52.860
<v Speaker 1>that's one possibility in the strict</v>
<v Speaker 1>social constructionists would predict</v>

1128
01:01:52.861 --> 01:01:53.040
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1129
01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:54.900
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they still teach that universities all</v>

1130
01:01:54.901 --> 01:01:58.440
<v Speaker 1>the time and which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I truly believe is appalling.</v>

1131
01:01:58.950 --> 01:02:02.080
<v Speaker 1>I think the data is already in on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

1132
01:02:03.810 --> 01:02:06.720
<v Speaker 1>there are consequences of this too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that it's still the differences</v>

1133
01:02:06.721 --> 01:02:09.280
<v Speaker 1>between men and women to say with</v>
<v Speaker 1>regards to agreeableness still aren't</v>

1134
01:02:09.281 --> 01:02:11.130
<v Speaker 1>that baby even in the Scandinavian</v>
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>

1135
01:02:11.131 --> 01:02:14.190
<v Speaker 1>But there are a lot more consistent and</v>
<v Speaker 1>larger there than they are in any other</v>

1136
01:02:14.191 --> 01:02:17.010
<v Speaker 1>societies that have been studied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's pretty weird.</v>

1137
01:02:17.070 --> 01:02:20.400
<v Speaker 1>And these are big samples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are samples of tens of thousands</v>

1138
01:02:20.401 --> 01:02:22.020
<v Speaker 1>of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not trivial studies.</v>

1139
01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:27.030
<v Speaker 1>This is a cool one because it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1140
01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:28.260
<v Speaker 1>it turns out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1141
01:02:28.261 --> 01:02:30.330
<v Speaker 1>there were a lot of reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were a lot of,</v>

1142
01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:34.350
<v Speaker 1>there has been a lot of discussion about</v>
<v Speaker 1>why the gender segregate in terms of</v>

1143
01:02:34.351 --> 01:02:36.950
<v Speaker 1>occupation and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

1144
01:02:36.990 --> 01:02:38.550
<v Speaker 1>sometimes that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1145
01:02:38.551 --> 01:02:40.620
<v Speaker 1>that's taken the form of an Iq argument.</v>

1146
01:02:40.620 --> 01:02:42.840
<v Speaker 1>So probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you guys remember this</v>

1147
01:02:42.841 --> 01:02:47.310
<v Speaker 1>because maybe it's too long ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this president of Harvard University</v>

1148
01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:51.360
<v Speaker 1>whose name was Larry Summers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he also served in whose cabinet I don't</v>

1149
01:02:51.361 --> 01:02:53.520
<v Speaker 1>remember at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably Obama's,</v>

1150
01:02:53.521 --> 01:02:54.900
<v Speaker 1>but I'm afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>

1151
01:02:55.980 --> 01:02:59.700
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Larry Summers is very high powerful</v>

1152
01:02:59.701 --> 01:03:04.620
<v Speaker 1>person in the United States and he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was giving a talk at Harvard at one</v>

1153
01:03:04.621 --> 01:03:08.910
<v Speaker 1>point and he was when the Americans</v>
<v Speaker 1>started to get concerned about science,</v>

1154
01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.370
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>engineering and mathematics,</v>

1155
01:03:11.371 --> 01:03:13.920
<v Speaker 1>the stem subjects say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're kind of thinking we need</v>

1156
01:03:13.921 --> 01:03:17.370
<v Speaker 1>more people in the stem subjects in</v>
<v Speaker 1>order to kickstart the economy,</v>

1157
01:03:17.371 --> 01:03:19.140
<v Speaker 1>which may or may not be true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>

1158
01:03:19.141 --> 01:03:22.020
<v Speaker 1>that was the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the problems that was being</v>

1159
01:03:22.021 --> 01:03:26.310
<v Speaker 1>dealt with was the relative dearth of</v>
<v Speaker 1>women in the stem disciplines.</v>

1160
01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:32.420
<v Speaker 1>And Summers made reference to a body of</v>
<v Speaker 1>research that suggested that.</v>

1161
01:03:33.660 --> 01:03:35.760
<v Speaker 1>So there's take that normal distribution</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1162
01:03:35.761 --> 01:03:37.200
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see that one on the screen.</v>

1163
01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:40.380
<v Speaker 1>Now imagine you search,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put another one right on top of</v>

1164
01:03:40.381 --> 01:03:42.390
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you flattened it so you just pushed</v>

1165
01:03:42.391 --> 01:03:45.240
<v Speaker 1>it down right in the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what would happen is it's a</v>

1166
01:03:45.241 --> 01:03:47.790
<v Speaker 1>little lower in the middle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it goes out a little farther on the</v>

1167
01:03:47.791 --> 01:03:49.860
<v Speaker 1>sides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then what happens,</v>

1168
01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:53.100
<v Speaker 1>which is analogous to what I told you</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened with agreeableness,</v>

1169
01:03:53.101 --> 01:03:56.580
<v Speaker 1>is that if you go out four standard</v>
<v Speaker 1>deviations above me,</v>

1170
01:03:56.880 --> 01:04:01.880
<v Speaker 1>so let's say to the 99 what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>85 95 99 to the 99.9 percentile.</v>

1171
01:04:03.390 --> 01:04:06.930
<v Speaker 1>So one person in a thousand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assume one person in a thousand becomes</v>

1172
01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:12.260
<v Speaker 1>a genius level is capable of genius</v>
<v Speaker 1>level accomplishment in the stem areas.</v>

1173
01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:14.813
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's one,</v>

1174
01:04:14.820 --> 01:04:16.740
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's more than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's say one in a thousand,</v>

1175
01:04:16.741 --> 01:04:18.460
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get a pretty decent</v>
<v Speaker 1>person at that rate.</v>

1176
01:04:18.630 --> 01:04:21.240
<v Speaker 1>They're all going to be men if the male</v>
<v Speaker 1>curve is flatter.</v>

1177
01:04:21.450 --> 01:04:25.110
<v Speaker 1>But if you go down the other side of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution and you look for the person</v>

1178
01:04:25.111 --> 01:04:27.220
<v Speaker 1>who's one in a thousand most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1179
01:04:27.450 --> 01:04:29.430
<v Speaker 1>intellectually impaired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're also going to be men.</v>

1180
01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:33.810
<v Speaker 1>And so that idea was that the mean</v>
<v Speaker 1>levels of Iq between men and women are</v>

1181
01:04:33.811 --> 01:04:35.850
<v Speaker 1>the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the standard deviation is different.</v>

1182
01:04:36.150 --> 01:04:40.710
<v Speaker 1>And the underlying biological</v>
<v Speaker 1>justification for that,</v>

1183
01:04:40.711 --> 01:04:43.230
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there often is more variability in</v>

1184
01:04:43.231 --> 01:04:46.620
<v Speaker 1>male behavior across animal species</v>
<v Speaker 1>because males are actually more</v>

1185
01:04:46.621 --> 01:04:48.900
<v Speaker 1>expendable than females.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1186
01:04:49.290 --> 01:04:52.920
<v Speaker 1>and there's a much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a differential reproduction rate</v>

1187
01:04:52.921 --> 01:04:55.710
<v Speaker 1>among males that's high enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that half of your,</v>

1188
01:04:56.250 --> 01:04:59.160
<v Speaker 1>you have twice as many female ancestors</v>
<v Speaker 1>as male ancestors.</v>

1189
01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:01.530
<v Speaker 1>Now you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's impossible,</v>

1190
01:05:01.531 --> 01:05:04.230
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the average woman had one child,</v>

1191
01:05:04.830 --> 01:05:06.360
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the average,</v>

1192
01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:08.310
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the average woman had one child</v>

1193
01:05:08.311 --> 01:05:10.800
<v Speaker 1>throughout history and the average man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1194
01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:14.730
<v Speaker 1>man who had children had to then that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you get.</v>

1195
01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:17.010
<v Speaker 1>But what it would mean is that there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>an equal number.</v>

1196
01:05:17.110 --> 01:05:21.120
<v Speaker 1>Men would have had zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the distribution for men in</v>

1197
01:05:21.130 --> 01:05:24.700
<v Speaker 1>fathering is a lot more like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a pretty high probability that a</v>

1198
01:05:24.701 --> 01:05:29.350
<v Speaker 1>woman will have at least one child where</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a relatively high probability that</v>

1199
01:05:29.351 --> 01:05:31.840
<v Speaker 1>a man won't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's all you need.</v>

1200
01:05:31.841 --> 01:05:36.250
<v Speaker 1>And so given that that difference in</v>
<v Speaker 1>reproductive value,</v>

1201
01:05:36.251 --> 01:05:38.410
<v Speaker 1>in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like the men don't have</v>

1202
01:05:38.411 --> 01:05:41.110
<v Speaker 1>reproductive value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that the reproductive value can be</v>

1203
01:05:41.111 --> 01:05:43.300
<v Speaker 1>fulfilled by a relatively small number</v>
<v Speaker 1>of men.</v>

1204
01:05:43.900 --> 01:05:46.030
<v Speaker 1>So men aren't the limiting factor in</v>
<v Speaker 1>reproduction.</v>

1205
01:05:46.031 --> 01:05:48.100
<v Speaker 1>Women are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so not to cross species.</v>

1206
01:05:48.101 --> 01:05:51.700
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens is the male seem to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get more variable in their,</v>

1207
01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:56.760
<v Speaker 1>in their behavioral display because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's more advantage to winning and</v>

1208
01:05:56.891 --> 01:06:00.010
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And once you lose it doesn't matter how</v>

1209
01:06:00.011 --> 01:06:02.080
<v Speaker 1>much you lose by in some sense.</v>

1210
01:06:02.230 --> 01:06:04.900
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got harassed to death for that.</v>

1211
01:06:04.901 --> 01:06:07.210
<v Speaker 1>I think they actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what happened to them,</v>

1212
01:06:07.211 --> 01:06:10.150
<v Speaker 1>but I think he had to stop being</v>
<v Speaker 1>president of Harvard University.</v>

1213
01:06:10.690 --> 01:06:12.280
<v Speaker 1>But he didn't even say that that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>

1214
01:06:12.281 --> 01:06:14.200
<v Speaker 1>He just said that it was one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibilities.</v>

1215
01:06:14.620 --> 01:06:15.640
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1216
01:06:15.641 --> 01:06:18.490
<v Speaker 1>there is debate about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no debate richly,</v>

1217
01:06:18.491 --> 01:06:23.350
<v Speaker 1>no debate about the average Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is some debate about the standard</v>

1218
01:06:23.351 --> 01:06:28.351
<v Speaker 1>deviations and I think the strongest</v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence is sort of enlightening in line</v>

1219
01:06:28.691 --> 01:06:32.290
<v Speaker 1>with the testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fetal testosterone exposure is that</v>

1220
01:06:32.291 --> 01:06:35.830
<v Speaker 1>men have a small edge and spatial</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasoning and that's the main mental</v>

1221
01:06:35.831 --> 01:06:38.710
<v Speaker 1>rotation for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that seems to be associated with</v>

1222
01:06:38.711 --> 01:06:42.820
<v Speaker 1>higher levels of fetal testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you do also see sometimes that women</v>

1223
01:06:42.821 --> 01:06:45.940
<v Speaker 1>have a small engine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>verbal and verbal intelligence and</v>

1224
01:06:45.941 --> 01:06:48.850
<v Speaker 1>verbal fluency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that might be more associated with</v>

1225
01:06:49.210 --> 01:06:51.570
<v Speaker 1>trait openness because trade openness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the open,</v>

1226
01:06:51.610 --> 01:06:54.670
<v Speaker 1>the creative activity part of treadle</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vanessa is higher among women than it is</v>

1227
01:06:54.671 --> 01:06:57.850
<v Speaker 1>about men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but regardless of all that,</v>

1228
01:06:59.020 --> 01:07:03.850
<v Speaker 1>what really seems to make the difference</v>
<v Speaker 1>with regards to the way that the sexes</v>

1229
01:07:04.210 --> 01:07:09.210
<v Speaker 1>distribute themselves in the in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>career landscape is interest and the</v>

1230
01:07:09.641 --> 01:07:13.120
<v Speaker 1>biggest differences between men and</v>
<v Speaker 1>women that are normally recorded are</v>

1231
01:07:13.121 --> 01:07:17.710
<v Speaker 1>recorded in terms of interest and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>basic distribution seems to be people</v>

1232
01:07:17.711 --> 01:07:21.790
<v Speaker 1>versus things which is quite cool</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that was derived as an</v>

1233
01:07:21.791 --> 01:07:25.660
<v Speaker 1>independent dimension before Simon Baron</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cohen started to do is work on fetal</v>

1234
01:07:25.661 --> 01:07:29.200
<v Speaker 1>testosterone exposure and those things</v>
<v Speaker 1>just happened to map on to each other</v>

1235
01:07:29.201 --> 01:07:33.790
<v Speaker 1>like his empathizing versus</v>
<v Speaker 1>systematizing is a lot light people</v>

1236
01:07:33.791 --> 01:07:37.900
<v Speaker 1>versus things and it also looks a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>like agreeableness and in fact I have a</v>

1237
01:07:37.901 --> 01:07:39.040
<v Speaker 1>student,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we checked that out.</v>

1238
01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:42.610
<v Speaker 1>We took Simon Baron Cohen's</v>
<v Speaker 1>questionnaire and mapped it onto the big</v>

1239
01:07:42.611 --> 01:07:47.110
<v Speaker 1>five and the empathizing dimension is</v>
<v Speaker 1>indistinguishable from from</v>

1240
01:07:47.111 --> 01:07:50.080
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness systematizing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks a bit more complex.</v>

1241
01:07:50.350 --> 01:07:55.350
<v Speaker 1>We haven't quite sorted that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But so men prefer working with things</v>

1242
01:07:56.351 --> 01:07:57.760
<v Speaker 1>and women with people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

1243
01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.240
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>effect size is almost one standard</v>

1244
01:08:01.241 --> 01:08:02.440
<v Speaker 1>deviation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

1245
01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:04.331
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

1246
01:08:04.331 --> 01:08:08.680
<v Speaker 1>it's a remarkably powerful effect size.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You rarely see an effect size of that</v>

1247
01:08:08.681 --> 01:08:10.330
<v Speaker 1>magnitude in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1248
01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:13.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in psychology or in the social sciences.</v>

1249
01:08:13.301 --> 01:08:17.150
<v Speaker 1>It's a very big determinant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So man show stronger people.</v>

1250
01:08:17.151 --> 01:08:20.360
<v Speaker 1>People have categories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jobs into six categories using this</v>

1251
01:08:20.361 --> 01:08:24.320
<v Speaker 1>thing they call Riasec realistic</v>
<v Speaker 1>investigative,</v>

1252
01:08:26.210 --> 01:08:28.070
<v Speaker 1>artistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social and conventional,</v>

1253
01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:29.780
<v Speaker 1>realistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>investigative,</v>

1254
01:08:31.070 --> 01:08:32.450
<v Speaker 1>artistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social,</v>

1255
01:08:32.660 --> 01:08:34.700
<v Speaker 1>conventional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no difference in enterprising.</v>

1256
01:08:34.701 --> 01:08:36.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the middle one is enterprising and</v>

1257
01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:41.150
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of a factor analysis derived</v>
<v Speaker 1>categorization system to end it is</v>

1258
01:08:41.151 --> 01:08:43.520
<v Speaker 1>related in intelligible ways to the big</v>
<v Speaker 1>five.</v>

1259
01:08:44.090 --> 01:08:46.340
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>men show stronger,</v>

1260
01:08:46.341 --> 01:08:51.290
<v Speaker 1>realistic and investigative interests</v>
<v Speaker 1>and women show stronger artistic,</v>

1261
01:08:51.291 --> 01:08:54.380
<v Speaker 1>social and conventional interests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1262
01:08:55.210 --> 01:08:59.360
<v Speaker 1>and there's no difference in</v>
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurial interest essentially.</v>

1263
01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:01.880
<v Speaker 1>So kind of know what you think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1264
01:09:01.881 --> 01:09:04.520
<v Speaker 1>but see one of the things that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's happened,</v>

1265
01:09:06.230 --> 01:09:09.110
<v Speaker 1>oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's actually what this next slide</v>

1266
01:09:09.350 --> 01:09:10.940
<v Speaker 1>talks about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's very good</v>

1267
01:09:18.980 --> 01:09:21.650
<v Speaker 1>difference between men and women</v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in engineering,</v>

1268
01:09:21.651 --> 01:09:22.550
<v Speaker 1>science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And math.</v>

1269
01:09:23.420 --> 01:09:26.260
<v Speaker 1>So the men are much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much more interesting engineering.</v>

1270
01:09:26.750 --> 01:09:27.950
<v Speaker 1>It's a big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big effect.</v>

1271
01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:31.070
<v Speaker 1>There are somewhat more interested in</v>
<v Speaker 1>science and that'd be the harder ends of</v>

1272
01:09:31.071 --> 01:09:32.890
<v Speaker 1>the science that aren't social,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1273
01:09:33.140 --> 01:09:36.050
<v Speaker 1>and they're more interested in math.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that you see</v>

1274
01:09:36.051 --> 01:09:37.040
<v Speaker 1>happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1275
01:09:37.041 --> 01:09:42.041
<v Speaker 1>if you take high math achievers at grade</v>
<v Speaker 1>11 or grade 10 there's not a huge</v>

1276
01:09:42.681 --> 01:09:46.220
<v Speaker 1>difference in numbers between girls and</v>
<v Speaker 1>boys in the United States.</v>

1277
01:09:46.460 --> 01:09:50.210
<v Speaker 1>But if you track them across time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the proportion of the high ability</v>

1278
01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:55.790
<v Speaker 1>people who go into mathematics or an</v>
<v Speaker 1>allied discipline is way higher among</v>

1279
01:09:55.791 --> 01:09:57.920
<v Speaker 1>the boys than it is among the girls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1280
01:09:57.921 --> 01:10:00.610
<v Speaker 1>you can make a case that there's some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sociol you know,</v>

1281
01:10:00.620 --> 01:10:02.390
<v Speaker 1>there may be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some social conditioning that's</v>

1282
01:10:02.391 --> 01:10:05.540
<v Speaker 1>associated with that except that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard to make that case when all that</v>

1283
01:10:05.541 --> 01:10:09.800
<v Speaker 1>you're the only people you're picking</v>
<v Speaker 1>are people who already equally good at</v>

1284
01:10:10.580 --> 01:10:11.270
<v Speaker 1>mathematics.</v>

1285
01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:13.550
<v Speaker 1>Because if it was cultural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd think that you wouldn't be able to</v>

1286
01:10:13.551 --> 01:10:16.050
<v Speaker 1>pull them out to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to make the case that all of</v>

1287
01:10:16.060 --> 01:10:20.180
<v Speaker 1>the cultural difference in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability is taking place after the,</v>

1288
01:10:20.660 --> 01:10:22.760
<v Speaker 1>the sorting is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has occurred.</v>

1289
01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:25.250
<v Speaker 1>That just doesn't seem right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what the,</v>

1290
01:10:25.310 --> 01:10:27.320
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what seems to be the case is the women</v>

1291
01:10:27.321 --> 01:10:29.780
<v Speaker 1>who are very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very advanced and mathematical ability</v>

1292
01:10:30.350 --> 01:10:32.360
<v Speaker 1>aren't that interested in pursuing it as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a career.</v>

1293
01:10:32.810 --> 01:10:37.610
<v Speaker 1>So it's interest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So women underrepresented in stem,</v>

1294
01:10:37.611 --> 01:10:38.570
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>

1295
01:10:38.571 --> 01:10:39.740
<v Speaker 1>engineering and mathematics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1296
01:10:39.741 --> 01:10:42.140
<v Speaker 1>women are walking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lee overrepresented in lots of</v>

1297
01:10:42.141 --> 01:10:43.640
<v Speaker 1>disciplines though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

1298
01:10:43.641 --> 01:10:46.250
<v Speaker 1>there'd be you becoming increasingly</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominant in,</v>

1299
01:10:46.550 --> 01:10:48.500
<v Speaker 1>in medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1300
01:10:49.010 --> 01:10:50.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not that's a real switch because of</v>

1301
01:10:50.781 --> 01:10:52.490
<v Speaker 1>course that wasn't the case 50 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>

1302
01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:56.300
<v Speaker 1>So high end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitively complex jobs that involve a</v>

1303
01:10:56.301 --> 01:11:00.290
<v Speaker 1>lot of social interaction and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>care for people are overwhelmingly</v>

1304
01:11:00.291 --> 01:11:02.390
<v Speaker 1>becoming dominated by women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1305
01:11:02.391 --> 01:11:04.730
<v Speaker 1>but math,</v>
<v Speaker 1>physical science is computer science and</v>

1306
01:11:04.731 --> 01:11:07.730
<v Speaker 1>engineering don't seem to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least at the moment in that,</v>

1307
01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:10.190
<v Speaker 1>in that group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1308
01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:11.840
<v Speaker 1>and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1309
01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:19.960
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1310
01:11:20.070 --> 01:11:22.630
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>occupations where women are unbelievably</v>

1311
01:11:22.631 --> 01:11:25.060
<v Speaker 1>underrepresented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why do you think that is?</v>

1312
01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:27.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you looked at this list,</v>

1313
01:11:27.341 --> 01:11:28.930
<v Speaker 1>what would you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you say?</v>

1314
01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:29.793
<v Speaker 1>Why would that be?</v>

1315
01:11:32.710 --> 01:11:33.543
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>

1316
01:11:34.700 --> 01:11:35.533
<v Speaker 1>Meetings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1317
01:11:35.630 --> 01:11:37.570
<v Speaker 1>Anything else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1318
01:11:37.580 --> 01:11:39.290
<v Speaker 1>it's physical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of that,</v>

1319
01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:40.370
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Construction,</v>

1320
01:11:40.371 --> 01:11:41.240
<v Speaker 1>forestry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mining.</v>

1321
01:11:41.241 --> 01:11:43.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean those are very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very physically demanding jobs.</v>

1322
01:11:43.531 --> 01:11:46.730
<v Speaker 1>So they require a fair bit of strength.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Generally you have to be isolated</v>

1323
01:11:46.731 --> 01:11:48.680
<v Speaker 1>somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially for forestry and mining,</v>

1324
01:11:49.310 --> 01:11:50.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other dangerous jobs.</v>

1325
01:11:50.991 --> 01:11:54.380
<v Speaker 1>Men are way overrepresented and</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous occupations.</v>

1326
01:11:54.750 --> 01:11:58.160
<v Speaker 1>And so almost all the exceedingly</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous occupations are done by men.</v>

1327
01:11:58.340 --> 01:11:59.840
<v Speaker 1>It's actually part of the reason that</v>
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>

1328
01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:03.320
<v Speaker 1>that men make more money than women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of reasons.</v>

1329
01:12:03.530 --> 01:12:07.370
<v Speaker 1>It's not pure arbitrary social prejudice</v>
<v Speaker 1>by any stretch of the imagination.</v>

1330
01:12:07.550 --> 01:12:10.940
<v Speaker 1>You need a multivariate equation in</v>
<v Speaker 1>order to account for the differences.</v>

1331
01:12:11.090 --> 01:12:13.340
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of different factors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them is,</v>

1332
01:12:13.341 --> 01:12:17.660
<v Speaker 1>is that um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>male run small businesses make more</v>

1333
01:12:17.661 --> 01:12:20.750
<v Speaker 1>money than female run small businesses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the reason for that is that</v>

1334
01:12:20.751 --> 01:12:23.210
<v Speaker 1>females often do that part time when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

1335
01:12:23.540 --> 01:12:24.410
<v Speaker 1>when they're having kids.</v>

1336
01:12:24.530 --> 01:12:27.290
<v Speaker 1>So they're not devoted entirely to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>small business,</v>

1337
01:12:27.291 --> 01:12:29.660
<v Speaker 1>but it's a way that they can keep in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>economic game.</v>

1338
01:12:29.661 --> 01:12:31.130
<v Speaker 1>While they're also pursuing their</v>
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>

1339
01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:35.230
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>men are more likely to move to work in,</v>

1340
01:12:35.260 --> 01:12:39.410
<v Speaker 1>they're more likely to do dangerous jobs</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're also more likely to work</v>

1341
01:12:39.411 --> 01:12:42.440
<v Speaker 1>longer hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so all of those account for some of</v>

1342
01:12:42.441 --> 01:12:44.660
<v Speaker 1>the reason that men are paid more than</v>
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>

1343
01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:48.500
<v Speaker 1>it's not pure prejudice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a good example of,</v>

1344
01:12:48.501 --> 01:12:53.120
<v Speaker 1>of the differences in male versus female</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominant dominated occupations,</v>

1345
01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:55.580
<v Speaker 1>brick masons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>block masons and stone masons.</v>

1346
01:12:55.910 --> 01:12:58.670
<v Speaker 1>There's virtually no women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cement Masons,</v>

1347
01:12:58.671 --> 01:13:01.400
<v Speaker 1>concrete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fisher finishers and terasa workers,</v>

1348
01:13:01.401 --> 01:13:05.330
<v Speaker 1>electrical power line installers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>carpet floor and tile installers,</v>

1349
01:13:05.570 --> 01:13:06.680
<v Speaker 1>heating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>air conditioning,</v>

1350
01:13:06.681 --> 01:13:10.520
<v Speaker 1>refrigeration mechanics and installers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>structural iron and rebar workers,</v>

1351
01:13:10.521 --> 01:13:13.340
<v Speaker 1>Boston truck mechanics and diesel engine</v>
<v Speaker 1>specialists,</v>

1352
01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:15.590
<v Speaker 1>miscellaneous vehicle in mobile</v>
<v Speaker 1>equipment,</v>

1353
01:13:15.591 --> 01:13:18.110
<v Speaker 1>mechanics tool and die makers and</v>
<v Speaker 1>roofers.</v>

1354
01:13:18.260 --> 01:13:23.260
<v Speaker 1>All of those are 99% or more male</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominated female dominated occupations</v>

1355
01:13:23.421 --> 01:13:27.890
<v Speaker 1>in the u s number one secretaries and</v>
<v Speaker 1>administrative assistance.</v>

1356
01:13:28.220 --> 01:13:30.470
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the most common job category for</v>

1357
01:13:30.471 --> 01:13:33.710
<v Speaker 1>women that's unchanged since the Middle</v>
<v Speaker 1>1950s so,</v>

1358
01:13:33.711 --> 01:13:36.200
<v Speaker 1>and that's partly because those are</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually pretty good jobs.</v>

1359
01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:38.270
<v Speaker 1>They pay well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're regular,</v>

1360
01:13:38.330 --> 01:13:41.120
<v Speaker 1>they're secure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not too demanding,</v>

1361
01:13:41.210 --> 01:13:43.940
<v Speaker 1>they're predictable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you have to have a jaw rather</v>

1362
01:13:43.941 --> 01:13:45.280
<v Speaker 1>than a career that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1363
01:13:45.290 --> 01:13:48.740
<v Speaker 1>cause a career or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose that pays you outside of the</v>

1364
01:13:48.741 --> 01:13:50.900
<v Speaker 1>money that you're making for the job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1365
01:13:50.901 --> 01:13:55.790
<v Speaker 1>it's got additional benefits in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>status or discovery or accomplishment or</v>

1366
01:13:55.791 --> 01:13:57.830
<v Speaker 1>creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you just want a job,</v>

1367
01:13:57.831 --> 01:14:01.130
