<v Speaker 1>Paul kennedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>welcome to ideas aristotle cleaned</v>

00:00:10.471 --> 00:00:13.440
<v Speaker 1>happiness was the ultimate purpose of</v>
<v Speaker 1>knife.</v>

3
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.220
<v Speaker 1>Mathematician and philosopher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blaise Pascal,</v>

4
00:00:17.221 --> 00:00:22.221
<v Speaker 1>believe that all men seek happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The poet Alexander Pope enthused,</v>

5
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.860
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>happiness.</v>

6
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.290
<v Speaker 1>Our beings end</v>

7
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.440
<v Speaker 2>and</v>
<v Speaker 2>praising.</v>

8
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.620
<v Speaker 2>The virtue of happiness is both timeless</v>
<v Speaker 2>and timely.</v>

9
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.540
<v Speaker 2>Go to your local bookstore and you'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>find shelves packed with titles like the</v>

10
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.900
<v Speaker 2>art of happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>authentic happiness,</v>

11
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.530
<v Speaker 2>the how of happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the happiness advantage to name just a</v>

12
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.630
<v Speaker 2>few newspapers and popular magazines</v>
<v Speaker 2>regularly published scientific studies</v>

13
00:00:56.991 --> 00:01:01.991
<v Speaker 2>toting the benefits of happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Happy people enjoy a greater capacity</v>

14
00:01:02.181 --> 00:01:07.181
<v Speaker 2>for intimacy in relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Happiness increases your physical,</v>

15
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:09.950
<v Speaker 2>mental,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and emotional health.</v>

16
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.820
<v Speaker 2>Happiness makes you more creative</v>
<v Speaker 2>with all that happiness has going for</v>

17
00:01:16.521 --> 00:01:19.730
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who doesn't want more of it as one</v>

18
00:01:19.731 --> 00:01:21.650
<v Speaker 2>expert in the science of happiness?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Put it.</v>

19
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.130
<v Speaker 2>It is the holy grail of life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone wants happiness.</v>

20
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:30.500
<v Speaker 2>CBC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>producer,</v>

21
00:01:30.501 --> 00:01:35.120
<v Speaker 2>Frank Fault isn't so sure in this hour</v>
<v Speaker 2>of ideas,</v>

22
00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.760
<v Speaker 2>frank questions our culture's obsession</v>
<v Speaker 2>with happiness and wonders.</v>

23
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.560
<v Speaker 2>If it's time to cool or hot pursuit of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

24
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.760
<v Speaker 2>Here's his documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say no to happiness.</v>

25
00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.160
<v Speaker 3>Let me make one thing perfectly clear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am not,</v>

26
00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.890
<v Speaker 3>nor have I ever been a curmudgeon,</v>

27
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.930
<v Speaker 3>at least not a committed one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like feeling good.</v>

28
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.090
<v Speaker 3>I try to maintain an optimistic outlook,</v>
<v Speaker 3>preferring to walk on the sunny side of</v>

29
00:02:14.091 --> 00:02:18.980
<v Speaker 3>the street,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but am I a happy person to quote the</v>

30
00:02:18.981 --> 00:02:20.540
<v Speaker 3>English poet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>William Blake?</v>

31
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.090
<v Speaker 3>Joy and woe are woven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fine.</v>

32
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.450
<v Speaker 3>I can tell you that's more of a mantra</v>
<v Speaker 3>for me.</v>

33
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.520
<v Speaker 3>Then don't worry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>be happy,</v>

34
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.090
<v Speaker 3>but to be fair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>having done some looking into this whole</v>

35
00:02:32.091 --> 00:02:35.630
<v Speaker 3>business around happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that no one is suggesting that</v>

36
00:02:35.631 --> 00:02:40.310
<v Speaker 3>striving for happiness is about ignoring</v>
<v Speaker 3>the woes of life and being cheerful.</v>

37
00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.690
<v Speaker 3>Twenty four,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seven.</v>

38
00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.210
<v Speaker 3>What I do know is that what is meant by</v>
<v Speaker 3>happiness is rather elusive.</v>

39
00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.210
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aristotle talked about the importance of</v>

40
00:02:50.211 --> 00:02:53.990
<v Speaker 3>happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what he meant by happiness had to do</v>

41
00:02:53.991 --> 00:02:57.560
<v Speaker 3>with living a life of virtue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>achieving the golden mean,</v>

42
00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:59.890
<v Speaker 3>a life lived balance.</v>

43
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.000
<v Speaker 4>Something like what a surfer achieves</v>
<v Speaker 4>when catching the perfect wave.</v>

44
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.990
<v Speaker 4>The fact is philosophers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>theologians,</v>

45
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:13.050
<v Speaker 4>and scientists have failed to come up</v>
<v Speaker 4>with a definition of happiness that will</v>

46
00:03:13.061 --> 00:03:15.760
<v Speaker 4>make everyone well happy.</v>

47
00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.710
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's absolutely true that happiness is a</v>

48
00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.130
<v Speaker 4>very elusive concept.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I started my career as a lawyer and I.</v>

49
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.570
<v Speaker 4>I spent a semester arguing about the</v>
<v Speaker 4>definition of a contract and happiness</v>

50
00:03:35.571 --> 00:03:39.710
<v Speaker 4>is even more hard to pin down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's something like 15 academic</v>

51
00:03:39.711 --> 00:03:42.980
<v Speaker 4>definitions of happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gretchen Rubin is the author of the</v>

52
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.860
<v Speaker 4>bestseller,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the happiness project in which he</v>

53
00:03:45.861 --> 00:03:49.340
<v Speaker 4>details her year of trying to achieve</v>
<v Speaker 4>greater happiness in her life.</v>

54
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.210
<v Speaker 4>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of coming to it as a lay person,</v>

55
00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.190
<v Speaker 4>the looseness of the term happiness</v>
<v Speaker 4>wasn't a problem and in fact was sort of</v>

56
00:03:58.191 --> 00:04:02.090
<v Speaker 4>an advantage because it could encompass</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of different things and different</v>

57
00:04:02.091 --> 00:04:05.090
<v Speaker 4>people might emphasize different</v>
<v Speaker 4>qualities within happiness.</v>

58
00:04:05.091 --> 00:04:08.170
<v Speaker 4>For some people it's more about peace</v>
<v Speaker 4>and some people meaning some people</v>

59
00:04:08.171 --> 00:04:10.730
<v Speaker 4>satisfaction,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some serenity,</v>

60
00:04:10.731 --> 00:04:14.910
<v Speaker 4>some mindfulness people emphasize</v>
<v Speaker 4>different aspects of it and I really</v>

61
00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.350
<v Speaker 4>wish I didn't have to agree with</v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone else and what was really</v>

62
00:04:18.351 --> 00:04:22.520
<v Speaker 4>important for me was not to arrive at</v>
<v Speaker 4>some perfect definition of happiness,</v>

63
00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.350
<v Speaker 4>but really to say to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

64
00:04:24.351 --> 00:04:25.880
<v Speaker 4>how could I be happier?</v>

65
00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.170
<v Speaker 4>Whatever it is to be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What can I do to be happier next week,</v>

66
00:04:30.171 --> 00:04:33.080
<v Speaker 4>next month,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I sort of took the dodge of justice</v>

67
00:04:33.081 --> 00:04:36.680
<v Speaker 4>potter Stewart who said of obscenity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know it when I see it,</v>

68
00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.120
<v Speaker 4>and I decided that for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I knew what it meant to be happier and I</v>

69
00:04:41.121 --> 00:04:45.950
<v Speaker 4>didn't really have to get all tangled up</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the precise definitions that are</v>

70
00:04:45.951 --> 00:04:50.180
<v Speaker 4>required if you're going to do certain</v>
<v Speaker 4>kinds of examinations of the subject.</v>

71
00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.580
<v Speaker 4>Gretchen got the idea to devote a year</v>
<v Speaker 4>to being happier while stuck on a bus in</v>

72
00:04:55.581 --> 00:04:59.240
<v Speaker 4>the pouring rain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not exactly a situation that inspires</v>

73
00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.760
<v Speaker 4>positive moods.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As it turns out,</v>

74
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.960
<v Speaker 4>it afforded her one of those rare</v>
<v Speaker 4>moments for self reflection in which she</v>

75
00:05:05.961 --> 00:05:09.050
<v Speaker 4>wondered what do I want from life</v>
<v Speaker 4>anyway,</v>

76
00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.680
<v Speaker 4>and what Gretchen realized that she</v>
<v Speaker 4>wanted was to be happier.</v>

77
00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.830
<v Speaker 4>Not that she was unhappy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She had a good marriage,</v>

78
00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:20.090
<v Speaker 4>two small children she adored and was</v>
<v Speaker 4>completing a book on John F Kennedy.</v>

79
00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.800
<v Speaker 4>What I meant by wanting to be happier</v>
<v Speaker 4>was that I.</v>

80
00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:27.860
<v Speaker 4>I felt that I needed to appreciate my</v>
<v Speaker 4>life more.</v>

81
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.400
<v Speaker 4>I felt like time was passing so quickly</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I wanted to grab onto it.</v>

82
00:05:38.051 --> 00:05:40.720
<v Speaker 4>I wanted to appreciate it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't want to take it for granted.</v>

83
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.720
<v Speaker 4>I have a phrase that I often say to</v>
<v Speaker 4>myself,</v>

84
00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.080
<v Speaker 4>the days are long,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the years are short.</v>

85
00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:56.210
<v Speaker 4>I wanted to ask more of myself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wanted to be a better mother.</v>

86
00:05:56.211 --> 00:05:58.760
<v Speaker 4>I wanted to be a wife.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to be a better friend and wanted</v>

87
00:05:58.761 --> 00:06:00.710
<v Speaker 4>to be a better writer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wanted to be a better citizen.</v>

88
00:06:00.711 --> 00:06:05.360
<v Speaker 4>I wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 4>expect more for myself and I thought</v>

89
00:06:05.361 --> 00:06:06.930
<v Speaker 4>about the qualities that I wanted and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

90
00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:08.990
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want it to be more creative and more</v>

91
00:06:08.991 --> 00:06:13.130
<v Speaker 4>lighthearted and more calm and more</v>
<v Speaker 4>patient and have more forbearance and</v>

92
00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:16.430
<v Speaker 4>less be less judgemental,</v>
<v Speaker 4>less naggy,</v>

93
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:21.940
<v Speaker 4>and I wanted to bring my life more into</v>
<v Speaker 4>harmony with my values and it's funny.</v>

94
00:06:22.371 --> 00:06:25.820
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I really understood that</v>
<v Speaker 4>very well at the beginning.</v>

95
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:27.710
<v Speaker 4>That was the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was one of the major,</v>

96
00:06:27.711 --> 00:06:32.180
<v Speaker 4>major things that I learned as I went on</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that was what was so important was</v>

97
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.290
<v Speaker 4>that my life reflect my values,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my temperament,</v>

98
00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:39.410
<v Speaker 4>my interests,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I could only build a happy life on</v>

99
00:06:39.411 --> 00:06:41.510
<v Speaker 4>the foundation of my own nature.</v>

100
00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:46.510
<v Speaker 3>Gretchen realized that if she was going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to tackle a project of this size,</v>

101
00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:49.420
<v Speaker 3>she needed a plan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so she created a chart.</v>

102
00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.690
<v Speaker 3>The chart was divided into the 12 months</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the year.</v>

103
00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:55.480
<v Speaker 3>Each month has a theme.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>

104
00:06:55.481 --> 00:06:59.170
<v Speaker 3>the theme for January was boost energy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>February.</v>

105
00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:03.040
<v Speaker 3>Remember love March,</v>
<v Speaker 3>aim higher and so on,</v>

106
00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:06.910
<v Speaker 3>and for each month she made a list of</v>
<v Speaker 3>daily resolutions,</v>

107
00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:10.240
<v Speaker 3>so under June's theme of make time for</v>
<v Speaker 3>friendship,</v>

108
00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.030
<v Speaker 3>her resolutions were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>remember birthdays,</v>

109
00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:15.580
<v Speaker 3>be generous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't gossip,</v>

110
00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:18.280
<v Speaker 3>make new friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every night.</v>

111
00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:22.060
<v Speaker 3>Gretchen would put a checkmark by</v>
<v Speaker 3>resolution indicating that she had</v>

112
00:07:22.061 --> 00:07:26.240
<v Speaker 3>managed to keep it that day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Having a chart help Gretchen to achieve</v>

113
00:07:26.241 --> 00:07:29.380
<v Speaker 3>or monthly goals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but seven months into a project,</v>

114
00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:32.170
<v Speaker 3>the pursuit of happiness got stalled.</v>

115
00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:37.760
<v Speaker 4>I hit a low point in my happiness</v>
<v Speaker 4>project at where I felt like I was</v>

116
00:07:37.801 --> 00:07:42.150
<v Speaker 4>making no progress.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was tired of my way of thinking.</v>

117
00:07:42.151 --> 00:07:43.710
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't tired of the subject of</v>
<v Speaker 4>happiness,</v>

118
00:07:43.711 --> 00:07:45.750
<v Speaker 4>which I have never failed to find</v>
<v Speaker 4>fascinating,</v>

119
00:07:45.751 --> 00:07:47.400
<v Speaker 4>but I was tired of my way of thinking</v>
<v Speaker 4>about it.</v>

120
00:07:47.401 --> 00:07:49.170
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just like every time you go to buy</v>

121
00:07:49.171 --> 00:07:53.460
<v Speaker 4>clothes you buy the same black sweater</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you bought before.</v>

122
00:07:53.461 --> 00:07:56.040
<v Speaker 4>I just felt like my thoughts were stuck</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a groove.</v>

123
00:07:56.610 --> 00:08:01.050
<v Speaker 4>I felt that I was backsliding and all</v>
<v Speaker 4>the usual ways and one of the things is</v>

124
00:08:01.051 --> 00:08:03.090
<v Speaker 4>when you think a lot about how you want</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be better,</v>

125
00:08:03.091 --> 00:08:06.180
<v Speaker 4>it makes you much more aware of what</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're doing wrong.</v>

126
00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:09.210
<v Speaker 4>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't think I gossip very much,</v>

127
00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:11.450
<v Speaker 4>but when I decided that I was going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>stop altogether,</v>

128
00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:13.110
<v Speaker 4>I realized how often I did.</v>

129
00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:16.500
<v Speaker 4>So I was much more aware of all the</v>
<v Speaker 4>things that I was doing that I knew were</v>

130
00:08:16.501 --> 00:08:18.450
<v Speaker 4>contrary to my happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I was doing anyway.</v>

131
00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:23.100
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things that came from my</v>
<v Speaker 4>happiness project is I just have this</v>

132
00:08:23.101 --> 00:08:26.850
<v Speaker 4>long bag of things that I do to try to</v>
<v Speaker 4>get through it.</v>

133
00:08:26.851 --> 00:08:30.780
<v Speaker 4>So it's things like go to bed early,</v>
<v Speaker 4>call a friend,</v>

134
00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:34.260
<v Speaker 4>go outside in the sunlight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gets some exercise,</v>

135
00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:38.490
<v Speaker 4>do a good deed for someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the best ways to self medicate.</v>

136
00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:42.480
<v Speaker 4>I did all these things and eventually I</v>
<v Speaker 4>came out of it.</v>

137
00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:46.980
<v Speaker 4>But I think it's natural to just go</v>
<v Speaker 4>through these periods where you just</v>

138
00:08:46.981 --> 00:08:48.030
<v Speaker 4>feel blue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

139
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:50.190
<v Speaker 4>and that wasn't for any particular</v>
<v Speaker 4>reason.</v>

140
00:08:50.191 --> 00:08:52.350
<v Speaker 4>But then of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>naturally we all have periods where for</v>

141
00:08:52.351 --> 00:08:54.690
<v Speaker 4>a very specific reason we're feeling</v>
<v Speaker 4>very unhappy.</v>

142
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:58.290
<v Speaker 4>So I think one of the things that are</v>
<v Speaker 4>happiness project is sometimes it's not</v>

143
00:08:58.291 --> 00:09:00.900
<v Speaker 4>possible to be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just not realistic that you're just</v>

144
00:09:00.901 --> 00:09:02.750
<v Speaker 4>not in a happy time of life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>

145
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:06.450
<v Speaker 4>you're not happy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think what I learned was there,</v>

146
00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:10.620
<v Speaker 4>there's things that you can do to try to</v>
<v Speaker 4>be as happy as you can be under the</v>

147
00:09:10.621 --> 00:09:15.050
<v Speaker 4>circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that kind of gives you the armor</v>

148
00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:17.340
<v Speaker 4>that you need to deal with a difficult</v>
<v Speaker 4>situation.</v>

149
00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:20.600
<v Speaker 5>Like any smart person planning along</v>
<v Speaker 5>trip,</v>

150
00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:24.890
<v Speaker 5>Gretchen did lots of research and</v>
<v Speaker 5>preparation for her year long journey.</v>

151
00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:30.110
<v Speaker 5>Many of the ideas she used to help her</v>
<v Speaker 5>deal with a difficult times came from</v>

152
00:09:30.111 --> 00:09:33.230
<v Speaker 5>the emerging science of positive</v>
<v Speaker 5>psychology.</v>

153
00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:38.690
<v Speaker 5>Positive psychology is really about the</v>
<v Speaker 5>scientific understanding of what makes a</v>

154
00:09:38.691 --> 00:09:42.590
<v Speaker 5>life worth living,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are the conditions that lead to</v>

155
00:09:42.591 --> 00:09:44.750
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then most importantly,</v>

156
00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:49.070
<v Speaker 5>what are the strategies that we can use</v>
<v Speaker 5>to help people move a little bit closer</v>

157
00:09:49.071 --> 00:09:53.600
<v Speaker 5>between where they presently are and</v>
<v Speaker 5>where ideally they'd like to be.</v>

158
00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:59.090
<v Speaker 5>Todd Cashton is associate professor of</v>
<v Speaker 5>psychology at George Mason University in</v>

159
00:09:59.091 --> 00:10:03.260
<v Speaker 5>Virginia and author of designing</v>
<v Speaker 5>positive psychology,</v>

160
00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:08.530
<v Speaker 5>a book on the science of wellbeing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He is also a self described provocateur</v>

161
00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:14.470
<v Speaker 5>and the field of positive psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The more that you actually take a gauge</v>

162
00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:19.880
<v Speaker 5>of how happy you are or assess how happy</v>
<v Speaker 5>you are or think about,</v>

163
00:10:19.881 --> 00:10:21.980
<v Speaker 5>reflect on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>am I happy right now?</v>

164
00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:25.610
<v Speaker 5>The more that you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the less happy you become and it becomes</v>

165
00:10:25.611 --> 00:10:28.580
<v Speaker 5>quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're talking about four times a day.</v>

166
00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.310
<v Speaker 5>You think about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>am I happy?</v>

167
00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:35.150
<v Speaker 5>You're less light.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're actually show detriments in your</v>

168
00:10:35.151 --> 00:10:38.030
<v Speaker 5>happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the reason for that is we're leaving</v>

169
00:10:38.031 --> 00:10:42.440
<v Speaker 5>the present moment so no longer are we</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the present and being open and</v>

170
00:10:42.441 --> 00:10:45.980
<v Speaker 5>receptive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're constantly deciding is what I'm</v>

171
00:10:45.981 --> 00:10:48.800
<v Speaker 5>feeling or thinking about now fit with</v>
<v Speaker 5>being happy.</v>

172
00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:53.240
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of well meaning people who</v>
<v Speaker 5>are studying happiness but are not</v>

173
00:10:53.241 --> 00:10:55.700
<v Speaker 5>skeptical.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't take things at face value.</v>

174
00:10:55.701 --> 00:10:57.860
<v Speaker 5>I'm a scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want where's the data?</v>

175
00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:02.890
<v Speaker 5>Where's the evidence?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mindfulness.</v>

176
00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:08.770
<v Speaker 5>There's this cultural obsession about</v>
<v Speaker 5>taking this philosophical and ancient</v>

177
00:11:08.771 --> 00:11:11.560
<v Speaker 5>teachings about mindfulness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is fantastic,</v>

178
00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:15.910
<v Speaker 5>but then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is it always adaptive to be mindful?</v>

179
00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:28.660
<v Speaker 5>And the answer to as to most absolute</v>
<v Speaker 5>statements is no.</v>

180
00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:31.550
<v Speaker 5>It's very resource intensive to be</v>
<v Speaker 5>mindful,</v>

181
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:36.910
<v Speaker 5>to focus with great profound awareness</v>
<v Speaker 5>and attention consumes energy.</v>

182
00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:43.040
<v Speaker 5>If you think about emergency medical</v>
<v Speaker 5>technicians going on the scene for</v>

183
00:11:43.041 --> 00:11:45.360
<v Speaker 5>someone for a crime scene or someone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

184
00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:49.640
<v Speaker 5>that's bloodied and has maybe you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hours to potentially live needs to be</v>

185
00:11:49.641 --> 00:11:53.030
<v Speaker 5>brought to a hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's research to show that being</v>

186
00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:58.050
<v Speaker 5>mindless and reflexively using their</v>
<v Speaker 5>skills to get the job done right then</v>

187
00:11:59.261 --> 00:12:02.320
<v Speaker 5>and there is more adaptive than being</v>
<v Speaker 5>mindful,</v>

188
00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:07.380
<v Speaker 5>so being a provocateur is about bending</v>
<v Speaker 5>over backwards to disprove ideas,</v>

189
00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:13.090
<v Speaker 5>to find out the truth and unravel some</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the mysteries of human nature as</v>

190
00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:17.920
<v Speaker 5>opposed to blindly accepting things on</v>
<v Speaker 5>faith because they fit with what I'd</v>

191
00:12:17.921 --> 00:12:19.480
<v Speaker 5>like things to look like.</v>

192
00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:24.740
<v Speaker 6>What concerns me with a current</v>
<v Speaker 6>obsession with happiness is that under</v>

193
00:12:24.741 --> 00:12:27.530
<v Speaker 6>the rubric of happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all sorts of things that aren't really</v>

194
00:12:27.531 --> 00:12:30.710
<v Speaker 6>related are often discussed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So for example,</v>

195
00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:33.170
<v Speaker 6>there are claims that happy people are</v>
<v Speaker 6>healthier.</v>

196
00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:36.170
<v Speaker 6>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the research doesn't precisely indicate</v>

197
00:12:36.171 --> 00:12:38.150
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What it indicates is that people who</v>

198
00:12:38.151 --> 00:12:43.151
<v Speaker 6>have less negative emotion are healthier</v>
<v Speaker 6>and we don't exactly know the direction</v>

199
00:12:44.061 --> 00:12:47.540
<v Speaker 6>of causality.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean negative emotion is a dimension</v>

200
00:12:47.541 --> 00:12:51.830
<v Speaker 6>in and of itself and people who are high</v>
<v Speaker 6>in negative emotion tend to be depressed</v>

201
00:12:51.831 --> 00:12:55.700
<v Speaker 6>and anxious and depression is associated</v>
<v Speaker 6>with increased production of a stress</v>

202
00:12:55.701 --> 00:12:56.750
<v Speaker 6>hormone.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Cortisol,</v>

203
00:12:56.751 --> 00:12:59.500
<v Speaker 6>and that seems to have very negative</v>
<v Speaker 6>consequences over time.</v>

204
00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:04.190
<v Speaker 6>It impairs your immune system and makes</v>
<v Speaker 6>you more susceptible to obesity and</v>

205
00:13:04.191 --> 00:13:08.120
<v Speaker 6>depression and cancer and heart disease,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but technically that's a negative</v>

206
00:13:08.121 --> 00:13:08.954
<v Speaker 6>emotion issue.</v>

207
00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:14.100
<v Speaker 5>Jordan Peterson as a clinical</v>
<v Speaker 5>psychologist and teaches at the</v>

208
00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:17.220
<v Speaker 5>University of Toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He lectures on topics such as the nature</v>

209
00:13:17.221 --> 00:13:20.430
<v Speaker 5>of self deception,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the role of neuroscience and human</v>

210
00:13:20.431 --> 00:13:23.190
<v Speaker 5>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The quest for meaning and purpose in</v>

211
00:13:23.191 --> 00:13:24.024
<v Speaker 5>life.</v>

212
00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:27.130
<v Speaker 6>Claim is often made.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The happy people are more creative and</v>

213
00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:29.500
<v Speaker 6>the evidence for that again is very</v>
<v Speaker 6>weak.</v>

214
00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:34.060
<v Speaker 6>There are a few studies that indicate</v>
<v Speaker 6>that if you put people in a state of</v>

215
00:13:34.061 --> 00:13:38.230
<v Speaker 6>positive mood that they can think in a</v>
<v Speaker 6>more creative manner briefly,</v>

216
00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:42.520
<v Speaker 6>but the bulk of the personality evidence</v>
<v Speaker 6>suggests that creative people are</v>

217
00:13:42.521 --> 00:13:47.170
<v Speaker 6>somewhat disagreeable and that they're</v>
<v Speaker 6>high in a trait called openness and</v>

218
00:13:47.171 --> 00:13:51.130
<v Speaker 6>openness is a measure of fluidity of</v>
<v Speaker 6>thought and it appears to be</v>

219
00:13:51.131 --> 00:13:54.670
<v Speaker 6>fundamentally unrelated to happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It might be objected.</v>

220
00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:59.710
<v Speaker 6>I suppose that the right response to</v>
<v Speaker 6>negative situations is to consider how</v>

221
00:13:59.711 --> 00:14:02.950
<v Speaker 6>they might be made better and I would</v>
<v Speaker 6>agree with that,</v>

222
00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:08.010
<v Speaker 6>but the problem is is that making things</v>
<v Speaker 6>better and being happy are not the same</v>

223
00:14:09.131 --> 00:14:11.710
<v Speaker 6>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Unless you decide by definition that</v>

224
00:14:11.711 --> 00:14:14.290
<v Speaker 6>they're the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in which case I don't believe that</v>

225
00:14:14.291 --> 00:14:19.120
<v Speaker 6>you're speaking within the scientific</v>
<v Speaker 6>realm because you're not allowed to put</v>

226
00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:23.590
<v Speaker 6>vastly differing phenomena in the same</v>
<v Speaker 6>box and called them the same.</v>

227
00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:26.680
<v Speaker 6>If you're a scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can do that in normal conversation</v>

228
00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:30.220
<v Speaker 6>and so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if someone is suffering from a terrible</v>

229
00:14:30.221 --> 00:14:33.160
<v Speaker 6>illness,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you might determine that aiding them</v>

230
00:14:33.161 --> 00:14:37.120
<v Speaker 6>would be an appropriate thing to do and</v>
<v Speaker 6>you might also consider that that would</v>

231
00:14:37.121 --> 00:14:39.880
<v Speaker 6>make you feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But to call that the pursuit of</v>

232
00:14:39.881 --> 00:14:44.440
<v Speaker 6>happiness is merely to be very unclear</v>
<v Speaker 6>about the distinction between compassion</v>

233
00:14:44.441 --> 00:14:48.490
<v Speaker 6>and joy and given the state of</v>
<v Speaker 6>psychological science at this point.</v>

234
00:14:48.491 --> 00:14:50.920
<v Speaker 6>There's absolutely no excuse for failing</v>
<v Speaker 6>to make that.</v>

235
00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:52.040
<v Speaker 6>But</v>

236
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.920
<v Speaker 4>you see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've dodged that by saying my have this</v>

237
00:14:54.921 --> 00:14:58.550
<v Speaker 4>project is my happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so the fact that there might be</v>

238
00:14:58.551 --> 00:15:03.551
<v Speaker 4>multiple definitions or sub topics live</v>
<v Speaker 4>in happiness that are somehow separable.</v>

239
00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:09.770
<v Speaker 4>I think that you get further in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking about how to be happier if you</v>

240
00:15:09.771 --> 00:15:13.640
<v Speaker 4>just throw it all into one big basket.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rather than trying to tease out the</v>

241
00:15:13.641 --> 00:15:16.190
<v Speaker 4>difference between compassion and</v>
<v Speaker 4>happiness,</v>

242
00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:19.610
<v Speaker 4>of course had been questioned in a</v>
<v Speaker 4>happiness project with you're setting</v>

243
00:15:19.611 --> 00:15:21.140
<v Speaker 4>out to be happier is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

244
00:15:21.141 --> 00:15:23.330
<v Speaker 4>how are you going to know if you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>happy or how are you going to measure</v>

245
00:15:23.331 --> 00:15:26.840
<v Speaker 4>yourself and and I have a friend,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a scientist and he was very,</v>

246
00:15:26.841 --> 00:15:30.320
<v Speaker 4>very focused on this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His idea was as I should have my husband</v>

247
00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:35.620
<v Speaker 4>score me every morning and night on a</v>
<v Speaker 4>level one to 10 scale and I was a look.</v>

248
00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:40.010
<v Speaker 4>That would definitely not add to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>happiness in my household because</v>

249
00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:44.030
<v Speaker 4>there's just no way my husband is going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be sitting around scoring me morning</v>

250
00:15:44.031 --> 00:15:46.850
<v Speaker 4>and night and I do think that I don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>really think that that was a very</v>

251
00:15:46.851 --> 00:15:50.540
<v Speaker 4>productive exercise to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just didn't approach it very</v>

252
00:15:50.541 --> 00:15:52.820
<v Speaker 4>scientifically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said to myself,</v>

253
00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:55.310
<v Speaker 4>I want to be happier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whatever that means,</v>

254
00:15:55.311 --> 00:15:58.370
<v Speaker 4>whatever the looseness of the term</v>
<v Speaker 4>happiness and happier mean,</v>

255
00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:02.030
<v Speaker 4>and if I think I'm happier,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am happier.</v>

256
00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:11.880
<v Speaker 4>And Kevin come to the end of it and</v>
<v Speaker 4>having continued to live with the</v>

257
00:16:11.881 --> 00:16:15.090
<v Speaker 4>consequences of it because.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because I continue to do all my</v>

258
00:16:15.091 --> 00:16:16.990
<v Speaker 4>resolutions and many,</v>
<v Speaker 4>many more resolutions,</v>

259
00:16:16.991 --> 00:16:19.980
<v Speaker 4>so my happiness project is really</v>
<v Speaker 4>something that I think I'll do for the</v>

260
00:16:19.981 --> 00:16:23.490
<v Speaker 4>rest of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just indisputable to me.</v>

261
00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:25.230
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think anybody who's around me</v>

262
00:16:25.231 --> 00:16:30.110
<v Speaker 4>would say that I'm absolutely happier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The atmosphere of my household is let</v>

263
00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:34.650
<v Speaker 4>more lighthearted and more calm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seems like we have more time,</v>

264
00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:36.450
<v Speaker 4>but it's not like we're doing anything</v>
<v Speaker 4>less.</v>

265
00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:39.450
<v Speaker 4>It feels more rich,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also more simple.</v>

266
00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:43.230
<v Speaker 4>I don't have a chart that shows me</v>
<v Speaker 4>ticking upward.</v>

267
00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:46.530
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't have vials of blood showing how</v>

268
00:16:46.531 --> 00:16:51.531
<v Speaker 4>my hormone levels have changed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I definitely feel confident saying</v>

269
00:16:51.631 --> 00:16:53.080
<v Speaker 4>that I did make myself happy.</v>

270
00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:06.430
<v Speaker 3>Gretchen's quest for happiness inspired</v>
<v Speaker 3>and continues to inspire others to</v>

271
00:17:06.431 --> 00:17:11.260
<v Speaker 3>create their own happiness projects,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which explains why her book has been on</v>

272
00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:15.580
<v Speaker 3>best seller lists since first hitting</v>
<v Speaker 3>the market in 2009.</v>

273
00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:19.720
<v Speaker 3>Gretchen's most important piece of</v>
<v Speaker 3>advice for those wanting to follow her</v>

274
00:17:19.721 --> 00:17:23.770
<v Speaker 3>example is this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>regardless of how you might define</v>

275
00:17:23.771 --> 00:17:26.530
<v Speaker 3>happiness for yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>making happiness,</v>

276
00:17:26.531 --> 00:17:30.580
<v Speaker 3>that the primary goal in your life is</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to help you achieve it.</v>

277
00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:35.500
<v Speaker 4>There's a long tradition of people</v>
<v Speaker 4>arguing that you shouldn't aim directly</v>

278
00:17:35.501 --> 00:17:39.010
<v Speaker 4>at happiness and that happiness is</v>
<v Speaker 4>something that's a byproduct of a life</v>

279
00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:44.040
<v Speaker 4>well lived or a life directed at other</v>
<v Speaker 4>aims and that you should and if you aim</v>

280
00:17:44.411 --> 00:17:46.690
<v Speaker 4>at being happy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was sort of will forte yourself or</v>

281
00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:50.550
<v Speaker 4>trip over your own feet or or somehow be</v>
<v Speaker 4>pursuing wrong goals that will bring you</v>

282
00:17:50.551 --> 00:17:53.250
<v Speaker 4>to a happy life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in my own experience,</v>

283
00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:57.240
<v Speaker 4>I really think that you're much more</v>
<v Speaker 4>likely to hit a target if you aim at it.</v>

284
00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:00.630
<v Speaker 4>And I found for myself that when I said</v>
<v Speaker 4>to myself,</v>

285
00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:03.300
<v Speaker 4>am I happy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How could I be happier?</v>

286
00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:07.770
<v Speaker 4>I almost instantly did become happier</v>
<v Speaker 4>just because asking myself that question</v>

287
00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:12.120
<v Speaker 4>made me appreciate more of what elements</v>
<v Speaker 4>of happiness I already did have in my</v>

288
00:18:12.121 --> 00:18:14.790
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Things that I was taking for granted or</v>

289
00:18:14.791 --> 00:18:16.020
<v Speaker 4>being distracted from.</v>

290
00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:20.820
<v Speaker 4>And it also helped me see places where I</v>
<v Speaker 4>could make changes that were not hard.</v>

291
00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:23.790
<v Speaker 4>It's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Happiness has a surprisingly bad</v>

292
00:18:23.791 --> 00:18:27.630
<v Speaker 4>reputation and I got a lot of criticism</v>
<v Speaker 4>from people when I.</v>

293
00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:30.210
<v Speaker 4>When I was saying that I was doing a</v>
<v Speaker 4>happiness project that I was trying to</v>

294
00:18:30.211 --> 00:18:33.840
<v Speaker 4>make myself happier,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was talking to a journalist who</v>

295
00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:37.710
<v Speaker 4>clearly explain that this was a very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very selfish,</v>

296
00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:39.870
<v Speaker 4>complacent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>spoiled,</v>

297
00:18:39.871 --> 00:18:43.980
<v Speaker 4>bratty undertaking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he was somebody who spent a lot of</v>

298
00:18:43.981 --> 00:18:46.890
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm doing kind of foreign reporting,</v>

299
00:18:46.891 --> 00:18:51.891
<v Speaker 4>so he was very aware of the suffering of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the world and he really felt like this</v>

300
00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:55.620
<v Speaker 4>was very morally questionable for me to</v>
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>

301
00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:58.200
<v Speaker 4>I was very naturally taken aback by</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

302
00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:02.220
<v Speaker 4>but I had done a lot of thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 4>it because it is something that you</v>

303
00:19:02.221 --> 00:19:03.900
<v Speaker 4>worry about when you're thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 4>happiness is.</v>

304
00:19:03.901 --> 00:19:06.750
<v Speaker 4>I did say to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is this very selfish?</v>

305
00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:10.920
<v Speaker 4>Is it morally inappropriate to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking about happiness when there's so</v>

306
00:19:10.921 --> 00:19:14.640
<v Speaker 4>much suffering in the world?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd been thinking about it sort of,</v>

307
00:19:14.641 --> 00:19:19.641
<v Speaker 4>but it wasn't until he really gave me</v>
<v Speaker 4>that withering look of disgust that I</v>

308
00:19:19.771 --> 00:19:24.030
<v Speaker 4>really focused on how did I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What did I think about the pursuit of</v>

309
00:19:24.031 --> 00:19:27.930
<v Speaker 4>happiness?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did I feel like this was laudable and</v>

310
00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:32.400
<v Speaker 4>what I found is that in my experience,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people who are happy in their own lives,</v>

311
00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:36.930
<v Speaker 4>they have the emotional wherewithal to</v>
<v Speaker 4>turn outward and to think about the pain</v>

312
00:19:36.931 --> 00:19:40.470
<v Speaker 4>of the world and they're more able to</v>
<v Speaker 4>intervene effectively because we more</v>

313
00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:43.860
<v Speaker 4>unhappy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We tend to be isolated and defensive and</v>

314
00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:48.890
<v Speaker 4>preoccupied with our own problems,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so it's not the case that happiness</v>

315
00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:53.310
<v Speaker 4>makes people complacent or self</v>
<v Speaker 4>satisfied or preoccupied with their own</v>

316
00:19:53.311 --> 00:19:54.750
<v Speaker 4>pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>

317
00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:58.200
<v Speaker 4>happiness kind of energizes people to</v>
<v Speaker 4>turn outward.</v>

318
00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:02.130
<v Speaker 5>Professor Todd Kashdan focusing on</v>
<v Speaker 5>happiness,</v>

319
00:20:02.131 --> 00:20:05.250
<v Speaker 5>trying to improve people's happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>writing books about happiness.</v>

320
00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:09.540
<v Speaker 5>This is a big money making industry and</v>
<v Speaker 5>while I'm critical of it,</v>

321
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:14.750
<v Speaker 5>I recognize that this opens the doors</v>
<v Speaker 5>for people to think about how they can</v>

322
00:20:14.761 --> 00:20:17.310
<v Speaker 5>improve their lives,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their relationships,</v>

323
00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:21.420
<v Speaker 5>and the way that they're operating in</v>
<v Speaker 5>this world which might be sub optimal.</v>

324
00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:22.493
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

325
00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:24.660
<v Speaker 5>Gretchen Rubin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who's a good friend of mine,</v>

326
00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:30.140
<v Speaker 5>she's dealing with how to create optimal</v>
<v Speaker 5>conditions for human beings.</v>

327
00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:34.020
<v Speaker 5>And she's focusing on multiple pathways</v>
<v Speaker 5>of getting there.</v>

328
00:20:34.021 --> 00:20:37.260
<v Speaker 5>She's focusing on multiple ways of</v>
<v Speaker 5>setting goals,</v>

329
00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:42.300
<v Speaker 5>meeting your goals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>deriving benefits just from devoting</v>

330
00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:44.670
<v Speaker 5>effort,</v>
<v Speaker 5>much less whether you even achieve your</v>

331
00:20:44.671 --> 00:20:45.760
<v Speaker 5>goals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think this.</v>

332
00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:51.080
<v Speaker 5>It's important to get the dialogue going</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so it ends up being that happiness</v>

333
00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:56.680
<v Speaker 5>is the gateway for having people think</v>
<v Speaker 5>about ways that they can intentionally</v>

334
00:20:56.681 --> 00:20:59.140
<v Speaker 5>improve their own lives and lives of</v>
<v Speaker 5>other people.</v>

335
00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:02.680
<v Speaker 5>It's a great thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but what ends up happening is this</v>

336
00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:07.660
<v Speaker 5>nebulous wastebasket term where</v>
<v Speaker 5>happiness is pretty much everything</v>

337
00:21:07.661 --> 00:21:12.550
<v Speaker 5>that's good in life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If we focus on happiness as a synonym</v>

338
00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:16.540
<v Speaker 5>for the good life or a synonym for a</v>
<v Speaker 5>well lived life,</v>

339
00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:21.520
<v Speaker 5>we miss out on so many facets,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so many nuances of what it means to be</v>

340
00:21:21.521 --> 00:21:23.920
<v Speaker 5>human and it beat full capacity.</v>

341
00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:30.780
<v Speaker 5>Creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>spirituality,</v>

342
00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:33.990
<v Speaker 5>meaning and purpose in light,</v>
<v Speaker 5>compassion,</v>

343
00:21:33.991 --> 00:21:37.230
<v Speaker 5>self compassion,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a sense of accomplishment,</v>

344
00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:41.820
<v Speaker 5>a sense of belonging,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a sense of what these things are not</v>

345
00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:45.750
<v Speaker 5>synonymous with happiness and there are</v>
<v Speaker 5>plenty of happy people that are not</v>

346
00:21:45.751 --> 00:21:47.670
<v Speaker 5>creative,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that are not spiritual,</v>

347
00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:52.530
<v Speaker 5>that are not mindful,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so using a wastebasket term to</v>

348
00:21:52.531 --> 00:21:56.970
<v Speaker 5>capture all of the beauties and</v>
<v Speaker 5>complexities of human behavior is</v>

349
00:21:56.971 --> 00:22:01.971
<v Speaker 5>extremely problematic and it trivializes</v>
<v Speaker 5>just how amazing and how complicated it</v>

350
00:22:02.911 --> 00:22:04.980
<v Speaker 5>is to navigate our social world.</v>

351
00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:16.600
<v Speaker 6>I've said that some people will tell you</v>
<v Speaker 6>that the purpose of life is to be happy</v>

352
00:22:16.601 --> 00:22:20.650
<v Speaker 6>and those people are idiots and was a</v>
<v Speaker 6>bit of a rough statement,</v>

353
00:22:20.651 --> 00:22:25.540
<v Speaker 6>but I what I meant by that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was actually inspired by a statement</v>

354
00:22:25.541 --> 00:22:29.320
<v Speaker 6>by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn who was the</v>
<v Speaker 6>great critic of the Soviet prison system</v>

355
00:22:29.321 --> 00:22:34.321
<v Speaker 6>and he commented that happiness is</v>
<v Speaker 6>something that's done in by the first</v>

356
00:22:34.601 --> 00:22:37.410
<v Speaker 6>harsh blow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That reality deals you and and,</v>

357
00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:41.230
<v Speaker 6>and I believe this to be the case there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There are many circumstances in life</v>

358
00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:45.250
<v Speaker 6>where happiness is not only the wrong</v>
<v Speaker 6>response,</v>

359
00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:49.060
<v Speaker 6>but also where the expectation of</v>
<v Speaker 6>happiness as a response,</v>

360
00:22:49.061 --> 00:22:52.600
<v Speaker 6>we'll put you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the person attempting to be happy in</v>

361
00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:56.680
<v Speaker 6>absolutely the wrong psychological state</v>
<v Speaker 6>to be prepared for what must be done.</v>

362
00:22:57.430 --> 00:23:01.720
<v Speaker 6>People are built so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to experience a very wide range of</v>

363
00:23:01.721 --> 00:23:06.550
<v Speaker 6>motivational and emotional states that</v>
<v Speaker 6>only bear a tenuous relationship to one</v>

364
00:23:06.551 --> 00:23:08.860
<v Speaker 6>another,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and the reason for that is that the</v>

365
00:23:08.861 --> 00:23:13.861
<v Speaker 6>environment that human beings inhabit is</v>
<v Speaker 6>so complex that are adaptations depends</v>

366
00:23:14.621 --> 00:23:19.270
<v Speaker 6>on a variety of very finally</v>
<v Speaker 6>differentiated responses and so there is</v>

367
00:23:19.271 --> 00:23:23.020
<v Speaker 6>a time to be compassionate and there's a</v>
<v Speaker 6>time to be aggressive and there's a time</v>

368
00:23:23.021 --> 00:23:27.850
<v Speaker 6>to be in pain and there's a time to be</v>
<v Speaker 6>anxious and there's a time to be joyous</v>

369
00:23:27.851 --> 00:23:31.900
<v Speaker 6>and a time to be satisfied,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and the healthy and well adapted person</v>

370
00:23:31.901 --> 00:23:36.280
<v Speaker 6>has a very wide range of finally</v>
<v Speaker 6>differentiated response which cannot be</v>

371
00:23:36.281 --> 00:23:39.130
<v Speaker 6>boiled down to a single dimension.</v>

372
00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:43.410
<v Speaker 6>Say happiness versus unhappiness.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A life is not that simple,</v>

373
00:23:43.411 --> 00:23:46.070
<v Speaker 6>and if it was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we'd only have one system</v>

374
00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:49.800
<v Speaker 5>happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All it is is it's a barometer.</v>

375
00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:51.620
<v Speaker 5>It's Dr Phil,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one-on-one,</v>

376
00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:53.940
<v Speaker 5>Dr Phil always asked,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how are things working for you?</v>

377
00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:56.430
<v Speaker 5>And if you say things are working well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's pretty.</v>

378
00:23:56.550 --> 00:23:58.650
<v Speaker 5>That's pretty much what we mean by</v>
<v Speaker 5>happiness.</v>

379
00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:03.070
<v Speaker 5>Happiness does not propel us forward,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it's very weird to meet this,</v>

380
00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:08.090
<v Speaker 5>the objective of your life and what I</v>
<v Speaker 5>mean by that is while I love being a</v>

381
00:24:09.391 --> 00:24:10.224
<v Speaker 5>father,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can.</v>

382
00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:13.380
<v Speaker 5>I will tell you point blank with my wife</v>
<v Speaker 5>listening,</v>

383
00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:18.120
<v Speaker 5>that it has not improved my happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>meaning and purpose in life through the</v>

384
00:24:18.121 --> 00:24:19.500
<v Speaker 5>roof.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Happiness.</v>

385
00:24:19.501 --> 00:24:24.030
<v Speaker 5>I was much happier as a 30 year old</v>
<v Speaker 5>having a lot of time with friends and a</v>

386
00:24:24.031 --> 00:24:28.020
<v Speaker 5>lot of time to travel and a lot of time</v>
<v Speaker 5>to basically do whatever the hell that I</v>

387
00:24:28.021 --> 00:24:30.780
<v Speaker 5>wanted to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So in terms of my happiness,</v>

388
00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:34.920
<v Speaker 5>it's detracted from it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are there moments of the most profound</v>

389
00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:39.950
<v Speaker 5>pleasure of the most profound</v>
<v Speaker 5>spirituality that I would die for these</v>

390
00:24:40.141 --> 00:24:43.290
<v Speaker 5>sacred vessels that I have in my life?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely,</v>

391
00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:47.580
<v Speaker 5>but that's not happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's spirituality to me is striving</v>

392
00:24:47.581 --> 00:24:52.170
<v Speaker 5>for the sacred and the sacred is things</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you would be willing to die for.</v>

393
00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:55.950
<v Speaker 5>What I die for a sense of satisfaction</v>
<v Speaker 5>in my life.</v>

394
00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:58.440
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what would I be willing to take the</v>

395
00:24:58.441 --> 00:25:00.720
<v Speaker 5>bullet over my kids?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely</v>

396
00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:06.200
<v Speaker 7>making happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The focal point of your life trivializes</v>

397
00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:11.240
<v Speaker 7>your experiences because in order to</v>
<v Speaker 7>regard anything as truly important,</v>

398
00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:14.900
<v Speaker 7>you also have to regard it's loss as</v>
<v Speaker 7>truly meaningful,</v>

399
00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:19.250
<v Speaker 7>and that means that to open yourself up</v>
<v Speaker 7>to experiences of deep meaning also</v>

400
00:25:19.251 --> 00:25:23.630
<v Speaker 7>simultaneously means that you have to</v>
<v Speaker 7>open yourself up to the possibility of</v>

401
00:25:23.631 --> 00:25:28.631
<v Speaker 7>deep hurt and sorrow</v>
<v Speaker 7>and you do that anytime,</v>

402
00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:33.940
<v Speaker 7>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that you make a relationship profound.</v>

403
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.690
<v Speaker 7>You put your emotions on the line and</v>
<v Speaker 7>that has to be real or the relationship</v>

404
00:25:37.691 --> 00:25:42.691
<v Speaker 7>can be real and to hope that that sort</v>
<v Speaker 7>of risk could be obliterated by the</v>

405
00:25:44.411 --> 00:25:49.411
<v Speaker 7>indulgence in a simplistic form of</v>
<v Speaker 7>happiness is to shrink.</v>

406
00:25:49.541 --> 00:25:53.710
<v Speaker 7>I think empowered is from the demands</v>
<v Speaker 7>that real human existence place on</v>

407
00:25:53.711 --> 00:25:54.544
<v Speaker 7>people.</v>

408
00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:04.440
<v Speaker 2>This is ideas in Canada on CBC radio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one across North America on Sirius</v>

409
00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:09.340
<v Speaker 2>Satellite Radio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Channel One 59 and around the world on</v>

410
00:26:09.341 --> 00:26:11.530
<v Speaker 2>CBC dot Ca.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm Paul Kennedy.</v>

411
00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:16.660
<v Speaker 2>You're listening to CBC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>producer Frank Faux say no to happiness.</v>

412
00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:21.730
<v Speaker 2>The renowned psychiatrist and</v>
<v Speaker 2>concentration camp survivor Viktor</v>

413
00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:26.320
<v Speaker 2>Frankl wrote what man actually needs is</v>
<v Speaker 2>not attention list state,</v>

414
00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:31.680
<v Speaker 2>but rather the striving and struggling</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a worthwhile goal of freely chosen</v>

415
00:26:31.871 --> 00:26:34.960
<v Speaker 2>task.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is much wisdom in the words of</v>

416
00:26:34.961 --> 00:26:39.520
<v Speaker 2>Nietzsche.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He who has a why to live for can bear</v>

417
00:26:39.521 --> 00:26:43.030
<v Speaker 2>almost anyhow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We now return to frank's,</v>

418
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:45.270
<v Speaker 6>say no to happiness</v>

419
00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:54.520
<v Speaker 7>at every moment.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We're surrounded by what we know and can</v>

420
00:26:54.521 --> 00:26:56.530
<v Speaker 7>understand,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but outside of that,</v>

421
00:26:56.531 --> 00:27:00.010
<v Speaker 7>we're surrounded by all the things that</v>
<v Speaker 7>we do not know and cannot understand and</v>

422
00:27:00.011 --> 00:27:02.050
<v Speaker 7>that can manifest themselves at any</v>
<v Speaker 7>moment.</v>

423
00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:07.500
<v Speaker 7>So we're like small islands of tentative</v>
<v Speaker 7>certainty in a massive sea of</v>

424
00:27:09.431 --> 00:27:14.431
<v Speaker 7>uncertainty and ignorance.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's our existential condition.</v>

425
00:27:15.351 --> 00:27:18.890
<v Speaker 7>It's really our environment.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Even from a scientific perspective.</v>

426
00:27:18.891 --> 00:27:23.891
<v Speaker 7>It's the environment that we've emerged</v>
<v Speaker 7>into and have adapted to and we have to</v>

427
00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:28.760
<v Speaker 7>take that into account when we deal with</v>
<v Speaker 7>our lives because that's the truest</v>

428
00:27:28.761 --> 00:27:32.150
<v Speaker 7>nature of our life.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's ordering the midst of the infinite</v>

429
00:27:32.151 --> 00:27:36.560
<v Speaker 7>chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The human problem is how to make sense</v>

430
00:27:36.561 --> 00:27:39.720
<v Speaker 7>out of the constant interplay between</v>
<v Speaker 7>that tentative order,</v>

431
00:27:39.721 --> 00:27:39.850
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

432
00:27:39.850 --> 00:27:41.170
<v Speaker 6>Not Infinite chaos.</v>

433
00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:46.010
<v Speaker 3>Jordan Peterson is a professor of</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychology at the University of Toronto.</v>

434
00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:48.830
<v Speaker 3>He is also the author of maps of</v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning,</v>

435
00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:52.910
<v Speaker 3>the architecture of belief.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His book explores how religious and</v>

436
00:27:52.911 --> 00:27:57.911
<v Speaker 3>mythological stories shed light on our</v>
<v Speaker 3>existential predicament and in turn can</v>

437
00:27:58.491 --> 00:28:00.320
<v Speaker 3>provide a sense of meaning and purpose.</v>

438
00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:05.760
<v Speaker 6>In the Old Testament in genesis,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's one of the most profound ideas ever</v>

439
00:28:05.761 --> 00:28:07.680
<v Speaker 6>expressed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The Old Testament,</v>

440
00:28:07.681 --> 00:28:12.681
<v Speaker 6>God in genesis generates order out of</v>
<v Speaker 6>chaos and upon doing so,</v>

441
00:28:13.291 --> 00:28:16.980
<v Speaker 6>he states,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man and woman are made in my image.</v>

442
00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:19.620
<v Speaker 6>What does he mean by that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

443
00:28:19.621 --> 00:28:21.960
<v Speaker 6>he dignifies the human soul with that</v>
<v Speaker 6>statement,</v>

444
00:28:21.961 --> 00:28:26.961
<v Speaker 6>but the attribution of dignity is based</v>
<v Speaker 6>on a psychological and an ontological</v>

445
00:28:27.931 --> 00:28:31.440
<v Speaker 6>reality,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and that reality is that what the</v>

446
00:28:31.441 --> 00:28:36.441
<v Speaker 6>individual consciousness confronts his</v>
<v Speaker 6>equivalent in some sense to the chaos</v>

447
00:28:36.841 --> 00:28:40.410
<v Speaker 6>that God originally turned into order at</v>
<v Speaker 6>the beginning of time.</v>

448
00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:45.360
<v Speaker 6>In that what you confront moment to</v>
<v Speaker 6>moment is the potential of being.</v>

449
00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:50.310
<v Speaker 6>That's what consciousness does.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It takes unformed potential and makes it</v>

450
00:28:50.311 --> 00:28:55.311
<v Speaker 6>manifest and each human being has the</v>
<v Speaker 6>choice about which direction that</v>

451
00:28:56.671 --> 00:29:00.600
<v Speaker 6>potential will manifest itself in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but not about whether or not that</v>

452
00:29:00.601 --> 00:29:05.220
<v Speaker 6>manifestation will take place because it</v>
<v Speaker 6>takes place no matter what and that's</v>

453
00:29:05.221 --> 00:29:09.810
<v Speaker 6>why the moral obligation of existence is</v>
<v Speaker 6>incumbent on our being.</v>

454
00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:19.720
<v Speaker 3>Existence implies coexistence to be is</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be involved with the life of others.</v>

455
00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:26.480
<v Speaker 3>We delude ourselves if we think that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're simply innocent bystanders and</v>

456
00:29:26.481 --> 00:29:31.220
<v Speaker 3>life being is never neutral.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What we do matters.</v>

457
00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:37.360
<v Speaker 7>You can be a creator of things positive</v>
<v Speaker 7>or you can be a creator of things</v>

458
00:29:38.001 --> 00:29:42.160
<v Speaker 7>negative or you can be a creator who</v>
<v Speaker 7>abdicated their responsibility,</v>

459
00:29:42.161 --> 00:29:47.161
<v Speaker 7>but in all three situations,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you are participating in the process</v>

460
00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:50.650
<v Speaker 7>that turns chaos into order and there is</v>
<v Speaker 7>no escaping that.</v>

461
00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:58.840
<v Speaker 7>When the high school kids,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the chart up columbine wrote about their</v>

462
00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:03.990
<v Speaker 7>philosophy and the most telling aspect</v>
<v Speaker 7>of their philosophy was their judgment</v>

463
00:30:05.741 --> 00:30:08.500
<v Speaker 7>of existence state and they did.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You can read this on the net.</v>

464
00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:13.890
<v Speaker 7>Their conclusion at the great age of 19</v>
<v Speaker 7>was that the tragedy of existence was</v>

465
00:30:16.001 --> 00:30:21.001
<v Speaker 7>such that being itself was corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That because people suffered and because</v>

466
00:30:22.601 --> 00:30:25.120
<v Speaker 7>of the world was a dangerous and</v>
<v Speaker 7>terrible place.</v>

467
00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:29.110
<v Speaker 7>That being itself should be eradicated</v>
<v Speaker 7>and this is a very common judgment,</v>

468
00:30:29.111 --> 00:30:34.111
<v Speaker 7>is far more common than people think,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and once you forego the luxury of</v>

469
00:30:36.641 --> 00:30:41.110
<v Speaker 7>deciding in a sense to hell with</v>
<v Speaker 7>everything that that everything is so</v>

470
00:30:41.111 --> 00:30:44.950
<v Speaker 7>corrupt that it's unredeemable.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Once you forego that luxury,</v>

471
00:30:44.951 --> 00:30:49.951
<v Speaker 7>then it becomes incumbent on you to try</v>
<v Speaker 7>to work for the betterment of being in</v>

472
00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:54.550
<v Speaker 7>that requires faith and the reason it</v>
<v Speaker 7>requires faith is because a,</v>

473
00:30:54.970 --> 00:30:57.700
<v Speaker 7>you don't know if ben can be bettered</v>
<v Speaker 7>and B,</v>

474
00:30:57.880 --> 00:30:59.950
<v Speaker 7>you don't know if you're the creature to</v>
<v Speaker 7>do it,</v>

475
00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:04.240
<v Speaker 7>but the peculiar thing is is that you</v>
<v Speaker 7>will never find out if being can be</v>

476
00:31:04.241 --> 00:31:08.230
<v Speaker 7>bettered or if you're the creature to do</v>
<v Speaker 7>it until you assume that it can be</v>

477
00:31:08.231 --> 00:31:10.990
<v Speaker 7>bettered and you assume that you are the</v>
<v Speaker 7>creature to do it.</v>

478
00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:15.250
<v Speaker 7>Critics of religious thinking believed</v>
<v Speaker 7>that what faith means is the willingness</v>

479
00:31:15.251 --> 00:31:19.420
<v Speaker 7>to suspend rational judgment and swallow</v>
<v Speaker 7>any old thing.</v>

480
00:31:19.421 --> 00:31:23.230
<v Speaker 7>No matter how absurd,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and that's not what faith means at all.</v>

481
00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:28.260
<v Speaker 7>What faith means is the willingness to</v>
<v Speaker 7>put yourself on the line in pursuit of</v>

482
00:31:28.391 --> 00:31:32.080
<v Speaker 7>those things that you find deeply</v>
<v Speaker 7>meaningful and that's why so many great</v>

483
00:31:32.081 --> 00:31:37.081
<v Speaker 7>philosophers such as Soren kierkegaard</v>
<v Speaker 7>emphasize above all the role that faith</v>

484
00:31:37.421 --> 00:31:42.421
<v Speaker 7>plays.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm a clinical psychologist.</v>

485
00:31:49.981 --> 00:31:53.280
<v Speaker 7>I have an active practice,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so I have 20 clients and I see them</v>

486
00:31:53.281 --> 00:31:57.060
<v Speaker 7>weekly and I'm a professor of psychology</v>
<v Speaker 7>at the University of Toronto,</v>

487
00:31:57.061 --> 00:32:00.240
<v Speaker 7>and so it might be surprising that I use</v>
<v Speaker 7>religious language,</v>

488
00:32:00.241 --> 00:32:05.241
<v Speaker 7>but it's not surprising because as soon</v>
<v Speaker 7>as you start to talk about the deepest</v>

489
00:32:05.490 --> 00:32:10.080
<v Speaker 7>meanings of life,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the language that is most appropriate is</v>

490
00:32:10.081 --> 00:32:14.640
<v Speaker 7>immediately religious and the reason for</v>
<v Speaker 7>that is that religion is precisely that</v>

491
00:32:14.670 --> 00:32:19.170
<v Speaker 7>element of human existence that deals</v>
<v Speaker 7>with the most profound elements of human</v>

492
00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:20.273
<v Speaker 7>being.</v>

493
00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:25.990
<v Speaker 7>I believe that the reason for this is</v>
<v Speaker 7>this,</v>

494
00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:31.090
<v Speaker 7>in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 7>human existence is so contradictory that</v>

495
00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:34.090
<v Speaker 7>it's in in a manner technically</v>
<v Speaker 7>impossible.</v>

496
00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:39.630
<v Speaker 7>We're limited creatures and we face</v>
<v Speaker 7>unlimited catastrophe in in everything</v>

497
00:32:40.251 --> 00:32:43.670
<v Speaker 7>we know will disappear and everyone we</v>
<v Speaker 7>love will die,</v>

498
00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:49.130
<v Speaker 7>and so that makes existence.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Human existence in a sense existentially</v>

499
00:32:49.131 --> 00:32:53.390
<v Speaker 7>impossible,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but the religious impulse combats that.</v>

500
00:32:53.391 --> 00:32:56.960
<v Speaker 7>In a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 7>because the religious impulse opens up</v>

501
00:32:56.961 --> 00:33:01.961
<v Speaker 7>to the human being the possibility that</v>
<v Speaker 7>there is sufficient absolute within to</v>

502
00:33:03.681 --> 00:33:08.450
<v Speaker 7>serve as an antidote to the absolute</v>
<v Speaker 7>without and the notion that it's</v>

503
00:33:08.451 --> 00:33:11.720
<v Speaker 7>necessary to have an individual</v>
<v Speaker 7>relationship with the absolute,</v>

504
00:33:11.721 --> 00:33:12.920
<v Speaker 7>with God,</v>
<v Speaker 7>for example,</v>

505
00:33:12.921 --> 00:33:17.921
<v Speaker 7>is a statement of the fact that we are</v>
<v Speaker 7>in fact adapted to the nature of reality</v>

506
00:33:18.831 --> 00:33:23.030
<v Speaker 7>and if we draw on everything that is</v>
<v Speaker 7>within ourselves without fear,</v>

507
00:33:23.510 --> 00:33:27.200
<v Speaker 7>then we can develop the sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 7>personalities that are powerful enough</v>

508
00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:32.440
<v Speaker 7>to confront the horrible absolute and to</v>
<v Speaker 7>consider that justifiable and</v>

509
00:33:32.961 --> 00:33:33.794
<v Speaker 7>worthwhile.</v>

510
00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:44.820
<v Speaker 8>I want to put it in a good word coming</v>
<v Speaker 8>from the Jewish tradition,</v>

511
00:33:44.821 --> 00:33:46.750
<v Speaker 8>a good word for happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's,</v>

512
00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:49.800
<v Speaker 8>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's striking to me that the very first</v>

513
00:33:49.801 --> 00:33:54.090
<v Speaker 8>word in the first verse of the First</v>
<v Speaker 8>Chapter of the Book of Psalms is a word</v>

514
00:33:54.091 --> 00:33:56.460
<v Speaker 8>that is probably best translated as</v>
<v Speaker 8>happy.</v>

515
00:33:56.580 --> 00:34:00.480
<v Speaker 8>So it says in Psalms,</v>
<v Speaker 8>happy is the one who does not stand in</v>

516
00:34:00.481 --> 00:34:04.290
<v Speaker 8>the way of the wicked or walk with</v>
<v Speaker 8>sinners or sit in the company of</v>

517
00:34:04.291 --> 00:34:07.020
<v Speaker 8>mockers,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but whose delight is in the law of the</v>

518
00:34:07.021 --> 00:34:10.710
<v Speaker 8>Lord in God's law.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Does he meditate day and night?</v>

519
00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:14.430
<v Speaker 8>Happiness is a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think a not a bad thing.</v>

520
00:34:14.431 --> 00:34:17.220
<v Speaker 8>It's certainly better than its opposite,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but,</v>

521
00:34:17.221 --> 00:34:21.030
<v Speaker 8>but clearly it is inadequate as a goal</v>
<v Speaker 8>for our lives.</v>

522
00:34:21.031 --> 00:34:23.860
<v Speaker 8>If that's all that we can inspire to</v>
<v Speaker 8>then alive,</v>

523
00:34:23.890 --> 00:34:26.670
<v Speaker 8>do become trivial,</v>
<v Speaker 8>then they become insignificant.</v>

524
00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.530
<v Speaker 8>The happiest creature in the world I</v>
<v Speaker 8>think is a lizard sitting in the sun,</v>

525
00:34:31.890 --> 00:34:34.500
<v Speaker 8>and if all we want to be or lizards</v>
<v Speaker 8>sitting in the sun,</v>

526
00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:39.030
<v Speaker 8>it won't work for us because we have an</v>
<v Speaker 8>awareness that lizards don't have.</v>

527
00:34:39.210 --> 00:34:42.360
<v Speaker 8>We have an awareness that there is</v>
<v Speaker 8>something greater than ourselves,</v>

528
00:34:42.361 --> 00:34:45.600
<v Speaker 8>greater than our material,</v>
<v Speaker 8>corporeal being that there is the</v>

529
00:34:45.601 --> 00:34:46.434
<v Speaker 8>infinite.</v>

530
00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:50.280
<v Speaker 3>Dan Polish is the author of talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about God,</v>

531
00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:53.680
<v Speaker 3>exploring the meaning of religious life</v>
<v Speaker 3>with character,</v>

532
00:34:53.681 --> 00:34:54.900
<v Speaker 3>guard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boober,</v>

533
00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:59.250
<v Speaker 3>Tillich and Heschel in his book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Polish explorers.</v>

534
00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:04.400
<v Speaker 3>How each of these thinkers understand</v>
<v Speaker 3>the human encounter with the infinite.</v>

535
00:35:05.730 --> 00:35:10.350
<v Speaker 3>The Danish Christian philosopher Soren</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kierkegaard coined the term angst or</v>

536
00:35:10.351 --> 00:35:15.351
<v Speaker 3>anxiety to describe our experience as</v>
<v Speaker 3>limited being overwhelmed by the</v>

537
00:35:16.081 --> 00:35:18.120
<v Speaker 3>infinite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Paul Tillich,</v>

538
00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:22.740
<v Speaker 3>a Christian theologian talked about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>courage to be in the face of our</v>

539
00:35:22.741 --> 00:35:26.730
<v Speaker 3>existential predicament.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Jewish theologian Martin Buber</v>

540
00:35:26.970 --> 00:35:30.810
<v Speaker 3>talked about the importance of holding</v>
<v Speaker 3>ourselves open to the unconditional</v>

541
00:35:30.811 --> 00:35:34.530
<v Speaker 3>mystery that we encounter in every</v>
<v Speaker 3>sphere of our life.</v>

542
00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:40.190
<v Speaker 3>Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel spoke of</v>
<v Speaker 3>knowing life has ultimate meaning.</v>

543
00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:44.010
<v Speaker 3>Though we can never fully comprehend</v>
<v Speaker 3>that meaning only sense it.</v>

544
00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:48.210
<v Speaker 8>All of them could be characterized is</v>
<v Speaker 8>existentialist thinkers,</v>

545
00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:53.600
<v Speaker 8>by which I mean that they like other</v>
<v Speaker 8>existentialist recognize that as</v>

546
00:35:54.090 --> 00:35:56.220
<v Speaker 8>Shakespeare said,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there's more in heaven and earth and</v>

547
00:35:56.221 --> 00:36:00.000
<v Speaker 8>there is in your philosophy of ratios.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They don't focus on creating theories.</v>

548
00:36:00.001 --> 00:36:04.170
<v Speaker 8>They know that the mind can go only so</v>
<v Speaker 8>far so they don't start with theory.</v>

549
00:36:04.171 --> 00:36:07.530
<v Speaker 8>They start with a with human experience</v>
<v Speaker 8>it religiously.</v>

550
00:36:07.531 --> 00:36:12.531
<v Speaker 8>That means that they are less interested</v>
<v Speaker 8>in talking about what God is a then</v>

551
00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:18.540
<v Speaker 8>talking about how we human beings</v>
<v Speaker 8>respond to God rather than trying to</v>

552
00:36:18.541 --> 00:36:23.280
<v Speaker 8>define that which they recognize</v>
<v Speaker 8>ultimately as beyond the capacity for</v>

553
00:36:23.281 --> 00:36:28.281
<v Speaker 8>human beings to either define or even</v>
<v Speaker 8>understand and that unless we find a way</v>

554
00:36:29.971 --> 00:36:34.020
<v Speaker 8>of living constructively with the</v>
<v Speaker 8>infinite are living in the infinite.</v>

555
00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:39.150
<v Speaker 8>Unless we find the courage to have faith</v>
<v Speaker 8>in that which we cannot begin to</v>

556
00:36:39.151 --> 00:36:41.940
<v Speaker 8>understand or begin to articulate a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>then we're,</v>

557
00:36:41.970 --> 00:36:44.620
<v Speaker 8>then we're going to suffer what</v>
<v Speaker 8>kierkegaard called angst.</v>

558
00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:46.350
<v Speaker 8>We're going to suffer that anxiety.</v>

559
00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:50.840
<v Speaker 3>Character guard by all accounts was not</v>
<v Speaker 3>a happy fellow.</v>

560
00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:55.160
<v Speaker 3>He suffered a major romantic</v>
<v Speaker 3>disappointment as a young man and</v>

561
00:36:55.161 --> 00:37:00.161
<v Speaker 3>eventually retreated into a solitary</v>
<v Speaker 3>life of study and writing when it came</v>

562
00:37:00.741 --> 00:37:04.580
<v Speaker 3>to achieving happiness in this life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't believe it was possible.</v>

563
00:37:05.330 --> 00:37:10.330
<v Speaker 3>The best we can do is aspire to diminish</v>
<v Speaker 3>the anx that defines human existence.</v>

564
00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:15.710
<v Speaker 8>As for the other three,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the who lived in the 20th century,</v>

565
00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:17.550
<v Speaker 8>that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that I've written about Heschel,</v>

566
00:37:17.770 --> 00:37:18.603
<v Speaker 8>Uber,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Tillich,</v>

567
00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:24.010
<v Speaker 8>all three of them knew a great deal of</v>
<v Speaker 8>suffering in their lives so that the</v>

568
00:37:24.531 --> 00:37:26.780
<v Speaker 8>idea of happiness being something</v>
<v Speaker 8>paramount,</v>

569
00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:32.200
<v Speaker 8>I think would look ridiculous to them,</v>
<v Speaker 8>or three of them were forced to leave</v>

570
00:37:32.810 --> 00:37:34.380
<v Speaker 8>Germany and Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>

571
00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:38.660
<v Speaker 8>when it fell under Nazi domination.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Heschel of course,</v>

572
00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:43.840
<v Speaker 8>came to the United States before the</v>
<v Speaker 8>full horrors of the Nazi reality acted</v>

573
00:37:44.571 --> 00:37:48.380
<v Speaker 8>itself out in Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He was living in Cincinnati,</v>

574
00:37:48.381 --> 00:37:53.270
<v Speaker 8>Ohio when he got word that his whole</v>
<v Speaker 8>family had been exterminated.</v>

575
00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:05.510
<v Speaker 8>My guess is that anybody who's life is</v>
<v Speaker 8>shaped as his wife's by that experience</v>

576
00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:10.190
<v Speaker 8>would really not take the notion of</v>
<v Speaker 8>happiness is the goal of life very</v>

577
00:38:10.191 --> 00:38:12.530
<v Speaker 8>seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And in this book on the Prophets,</v>

578
00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:13.610
<v Speaker 8>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 8>quote,</v>

579
00:38:13.970 --> 00:38:17.750
<v Speaker 8>the world is dark and human agony is</v>
<v Speaker 8>excruciating.</v>

580
00:38:22.850 --> 00:38:24.050
<v Speaker 8>This is not the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

581
00:38:24.051 --> 00:38:28.280
<v Speaker 8>the writings of somebody who could</v>
<v Speaker 8>understand human life in terms of what</v>

582
00:38:28.310 --> 00:38:29.690
<v Speaker 8>we're calling happiness here.</v>

583
00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:37.490
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

584
00:38:47.350 --> 00:38:52.350
<v Speaker 6>It's something strange that I've</v>
<v Speaker 6>observed with my students is that when I</v>

585
00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:57.570
<v Speaker 6>state the proposition to them clearly</v>
<v Speaker 6>that life is suffering and that the</v>

586
00:38:57.571 --> 00:39:01.530
<v Speaker 6>purpose of life is not happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They actually experienced that as a</v>

587
00:39:01.531 --> 00:39:04.350
<v Speaker 6>great relief.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the reason I believe that they</v>

588
00:39:04.351 --> 00:39:07.230
<v Speaker 6>experienced it as a great relief is they</v>
<v Speaker 6>already know it.</v>

589
00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:09.510
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>even if they wouldn't necessarily</v>

590
00:39:09.511 --> 00:39:13.920
<v Speaker 6>articulate that their experience has</v>
<v Speaker 6>taught them that life is complex and</v>

591
00:39:13.921 --> 00:39:18.030
<v Speaker 6>tragic and difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the problem with the public</v>

592
00:39:18.450 --> 00:39:22.920
<v Speaker 6>portrayal of the ideal state of</v>
<v Speaker 6>humanness as happiness is that it makes</v>

593
00:39:22.921 --> 00:39:27.240
<v Speaker 6>all of these people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>these young people feel ashamed of their</v>

594
00:39:27.241 --> 00:39:30.210
<v Speaker 6>own suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They feel that if they're suffering and</v>

595
00:39:30.211 --> 00:39:32.460
<v Speaker 6>if they find their life tragic in its</v>
<v Speaker 6>essence,</v>

596
00:39:32.461 --> 00:39:35.580
<v Speaker 6>that that means that there's something</v>
<v Speaker 6>wrong with them and instantly that makes</v>

597
00:39:35.581 --> 00:39:39.720
<v Speaker 6>it impossible for them to communicate</v>
<v Speaker 6>anything real about their own tragedy.</v>

598
00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:45.320
<v Speaker 8>One of the great spiritual geniuses of</v>
<v Speaker 8>all humanity was the Buddha and the</v>

599
00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:51.300
<v Speaker 8>Buddha came to an understanding that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that he can talk about human life in</v>

600
00:39:51.301 --> 00:39:54.690
<v Speaker 8>terms of four noble truths.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And the first of the noble truths is</v>

601
00:39:54.691 --> 00:39:57.150
<v Speaker 8>that all of life is Duco,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which we,</v>

602
00:39:57.630 --> 00:39:59.990
<v Speaker 8>which we can translate as suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>

603
00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.880
<v Speaker 8>the Buddhist teaching.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I said the essence of the human</v>

604
00:40:02.881 --> 00:40:07.881
<v Speaker 8>experience is to suffer that suffering</v>
<v Speaker 8>is not some unfortunate thing that</v>

605
00:40:08.490 --> 00:40:13.490
<v Speaker 8>disrupts an otherwise perfect existence</v>
<v Speaker 8>or that suffering is a,</v>

606
00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:17.220
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>an accident that may be false on people.</v>

607
00:40:17.490 --> 00:40:21.660
<v Speaker 8>The Buddhist teaching that suffering is</v>
<v Speaker 8>at the heart of being a human.</v>

608
00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:26.360
<v Speaker 6>And so it appears to me that the price</v>
<v Speaker 6>we pay for being is suffering.</v>

609
00:40:27.110 --> 00:40:30.980
<v Speaker 6>And then the issue there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I believe that this is what the</v>

610
00:40:30.981 --> 00:40:34.670
<v Speaker 6>greater religious traditions of the</v>
<v Speaker 6>world have been attempting to elucidate,</v>

611
00:40:34.671 --> 00:40:39.671
<v Speaker 6>is that the purpose of life given that</v>
<v Speaker 6>is to identify and and follow a mode of</v>

612
00:40:41.961 --> 00:40:46.961
<v Speaker 6>being that makes life justifiable,</v>
<v Speaker 6>even given the radical necessity of</v>

613
00:40:47.571 --> 00:40:50.870
<v Speaker 6>suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you're constantly in a state of</v>

614
00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:55.900
<v Speaker 6>placidity satisfaction and happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then nothing is going to affect you</v>

615
00:40:56.121 --> 00:40:59.630
<v Speaker 6>deeply enough,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not your own suffering and the suffering</v>

616
00:40:59.631 --> 00:41:01.490
<v Speaker 6>of other people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not Injustice,</v>

617
00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:04.610
<v Speaker 6>not knocked the horrors of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Nothing is going to affect you deeply</v>

618
00:41:04.611 --> 00:41:09.611
<v Speaker 6>enough so that you'll become deep and</v>
<v Speaker 6>life without depth is by definition</v>

619
00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:14.870
<v Speaker 6>shallow and meaningless,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and there's a problem that's associated</v>

620
00:41:14.871 --> 00:41:18.830
<v Speaker 6>with that because life is tragic and</v>
<v Speaker 6>because life involves suffering.</v>

621
00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:21.530
<v Speaker 6>If your philosophy is shallow and</v>
<v Speaker 6>meaningless,</v>

622
00:41:21.531 --> 00:41:26.531
<v Speaker 6>when you suffer,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you'll become resentful and hostile and</v>

623
00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:33.620
<v Speaker 6>self critical and then you'll become</v>
<v Speaker 6>cruel and destructive.</v>

624
00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:38.860
<v Speaker 6>And so not only is there a necessity for</v>
<v Speaker 6>your own mental health too,</v>

625
00:41:40.270 --> 00:41:40.570
<v Speaker 5>14</v>

626
00:41:40.570 --> 00:41:43.080
<v Speaker 6>rightly confront the deepest questions</v>
<v Speaker 6>of life,</v>

627
00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:46.740
<v Speaker 6>but if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then you remain a danger to yourself.</v>

628
00:41:46.741 --> 00:41:48.630
<v Speaker 6>And maybe more importantly to others,</v>

629
00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:53.040
<v Speaker 8>the suffering that we experience is</v>
<v Speaker 8>something that we can use.</v>

630
00:41:53.041 --> 00:41:58.041
<v Speaker 8>There's the well known image of the</v>
<v Speaker 8>grain of sand that finds its way into</v>

631
00:41:58.681 --> 00:42:03.000
<v Speaker 8>the shell of an oyster and out of that</v>
<v Speaker 8>discomfort,</v>

632
00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:05.220
<v Speaker 8>the oyster fashions,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the Pearl,</v>

633
00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:08.430
<v Speaker 8>the ox,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the kierkegaard talks about can become</v>

634
00:42:08.431 --> 00:42:13.431
<v Speaker 8>the inspiration of for us to live in</v>
<v Speaker 8>ways that transcend simple selfishness,</v>

635
00:42:15.841 --> 00:42:19.050
<v Speaker 8>simple egocentricity simple focusing on</v>
<v Speaker 8>ourselves.</v>

636
00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:21.840
<v Speaker 8>Reinhold Niebuhr,</v>
<v Speaker 8>who was actually a very close friend of</v>

637
00:42:21.841 --> 00:42:26.520
<v Speaker 8>Heschel,</v>
<v Speaker 8>said that life has no meaning except in</v>

638
00:42:26.521 --> 00:42:30.000
<v Speaker 8>terms of responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm sure how she would shake his head.</v>

639
00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:35.060
<v Speaker 8>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 8>One of Heschel's earliest books is</v>

640
00:42:38.871 --> 00:42:42.290
<v Speaker 8>called the image of God in this world.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Humanity.</v>

641
00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:45.560
<v Speaker 8>Human beings are God's image in this</v>
<v Speaker 8>world.</v>

642
00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:51.580
<v Speaker 8>Our goal in life is very clear to be in</v>
<v Speaker 8>this world where we would want God to be</v>

643
00:42:51.651 --> 00:42:56.651
<v Speaker 8>in this world</v>
<v Speaker 8>for us through our actions and our</v>

644
00:42:59.711 --> 00:43:04.711
<v Speaker 8>behaviors and our engagements to</v>
<v Speaker 8>manifest God in the world,</v>

645
00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:11.090
<v Speaker 8>to be radically discontent with the</v>
<v Speaker 8>things that exist in this world,</v>

646
00:43:11.091 --> 00:43:15.350
<v Speaker 8>to be radically discontent with the</v>
<v Speaker 8>social evils that we see around us.</v>

647
00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:22.860
<v Speaker 8>Do what we can to write them</v>
<v Speaker 8>because we are God's own self.</v>

648
00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:25.990
<v Speaker 8>Is it work in this world</v>

649
00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:32.420
<v Speaker 8>which actually wouldn't say means where</v>
<v Speaker 8>we finally become the most human.</v>

650
00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:51.500
<v Speaker 5>I've gotten very interested in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>psychology of morality because we often</v>

651
00:43:52.290 --> 00:43:56.160
<v Speaker 5>push it aside to just religious</v>
<v Speaker 5>teachings,</v>

652
00:43:56.190 --> 00:43:59.160
<v Speaker 5>religious ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and when we're making moral decisions on</v>

653
00:43:59.161 --> 00:44:04.161
<v Speaker 5>a daily basis and it makes me think of</v>
<v Speaker 5>exemplars of people that have profound</v>

654
00:44:04.651 --> 00:44:08.550
<v Speaker 5>meaning and purpose in life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but are probably average to below</v>

655
00:44:08.551 --> 00:44:13.551
<v Speaker 5>average on happiness and Martin Luther</v>
<v Speaker 5>King happens to be a real great example</v>

656
00:44:13.651 --> 00:44:16.770
<v Speaker 5>of this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Todd Cashton is associate professor of</v>

657
00:44:16.771 --> 00:44:19.860
<v Speaker 5>psychology at George Mason University in</v>
<v Speaker 5>Virginia.</v>

658
00:44:20.250 --> 00:44:23.640
<v Speaker 5>He is the author of designing positive</v>
<v Speaker 5>psychology,</v>

659
00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:29.120
<v Speaker 5>a book on the science of wellbeing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Professor cashton regularly gives talks</v>

660
00:44:29.281 --> 00:44:33.450
<v Speaker 5>and workshops on how to live a</v>
<v Speaker 5>worthwhile and meaningful life.</v>

661
00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:38.960
<v Speaker 5>This is someone in context who had</v>
<v Speaker 5>extreme righteous indignation.</v>

662
00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:44.580
<v Speaker 5>This is a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is just a manifestation of anger of</v>

663
00:44:44.730 --> 00:44:48.270
<v Speaker 5>the mistreatment of other of other</v>
<v Speaker 5>fellow human beings on the lack of</v>

664
00:44:48.271 --> 00:44:51.870
<v Speaker 5>equality and fairness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These are fundamental moral principles</v>

665
00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:54.030
<v Speaker 5>and his life was devoted to this.</v>

666
00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:59.720
<v Speaker 5>If you're talking about pursuing goals</v>
<v Speaker 5>that are outside the parameters of</v>

667
00:45:01.141 --> 00:45:03.600
<v Speaker 5>happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look to Martin Luther King,</v>

668
00:45:04.050 --> 00:45:09.050
<v Speaker 5>the idea of absorbing the blues,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the hatred,</v>

669
00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:12.780
<v Speaker 5>the prejudice,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the discrimination for other people to</v>

670
00:45:12.781 --> 00:45:17.781
<v Speaker 5>make a point that these,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these behaviors are not indicative of</v>

671
00:45:19.231 --> 00:45:23.850
<v Speaker 5>what a good society is built on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and Martin Luther King is not the only</v>

672
00:45:23.851 --> 00:45:27.120
<v Speaker 5>person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He just happens to be a public exemplar.</v>

673
00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:31.830
<v Speaker 5>You have people in schools right here in</v>
<v Speaker 5>DC where I'm sitting right now who are</v>

674
00:45:31.831 --> 00:45:36.831
<v Speaker 5>devoting themselves in inner city kids.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You've got teachers that are creating a</v>

675
00:45:37.051 --> 00:45:40.380
<v Speaker 5>safe space for them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a place where they can actually learn</v>

676
00:45:40.410 --> 00:45:43.530
<v Speaker 5>and grow and become a moral outstanding</v>
<v Speaker 5>citizen.</v>

677
00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:48.150
<v Speaker 5>We're talking about people that are</v>
<v Speaker 5>taking time away from their own</v>

678
00:45:48.151 --> 00:45:53.040
<v Speaker 5>happiness to do something that really</v>
<v Speaker 5>matters and but lead to a sense of</v>

679
00:45:53.041 --> 00:45:56.760
<v Speaker 5>morality,</v>
<v Speaker 5>meaning and purpose in life that just</v>

680
00:45:56.761 --> 00:45:58.980
<v Speaker 5>don't fit on the same spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

681
00:45:58.981 --> 00:46:03.960
<v Speaker 5>there are multiple pathways to living a</v>
<v Speaker 5>good life and I think a better approach</v>

682
00:46:04.110 --> 00:46:08.610
<v Speaker 5>than having happiness as the ultimate</v>
<v Speaker 5>end point is to do things you care</v>

683
00:46:08.611 --> 00:46:10.800
<v Speaker 5>about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're not talking about happiness.</v>

684
00:46:10.801 --> 00:46:14.550
<v Speaker 5>We're talking about engagement.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're talking about meaningful pursuits.</v>

685
00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:20.320
<v Speaker 6>Nothing can drive you to find the</v>
<v Speaker 6>deepest meanings of life without first</v>

686
00:46:21.891 --> 00:46:26.630
<v Speaker 6>realizing the absolute fragility of life</v>
<v Speaker 6>because there's nothing that's</v>

687
00:46:26.631 --> 00:46:31.631
<v Speaker 6>sufficiently terrifying as realization</v>
<v Speaker 6>of that absolute fragility and it's</v>

688
00:46:32.391 --> 00:46:37.391
<v Speaker 6>necessary to be profoundly terrified</v>
<v Speaker 6>before you can be motivated to seek out</v>

689
00:46:38.661 --> 00:46:42.920
<v Speaker 6>those things that are of the highest</v>
<v Speaker 6>value as a consequence of considering</v>

690
00:46:42.921 --> 00:46:47.240
<v Speaker 6>these ideas for many years and</v>
<v Speaker 6>especially considering the role that</v>

691
00:46:47.241 --> 00:46:50.060
<v Speaker 6>evil has played,</v>
<v Speaker 6>say in the 20th century and also the</v>

692
00:46:50.061 --> 00:46:55.061
<v Speaker 6>role that suffering plays in life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've asked myself deeply what the</v>

693
00:46:55.821 --> 00:47:00.821
<v Speaker 6>purpose of life might be and it seems to</v>
<v Speaker 6>me that life requires virtue and so then</v>

694
00:47:02.121 --> 00:47:02.871
<v Speaker 6>you might ask,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

695
00:47:02.871 --> 00:47:07.871
<v Speaker 6>what do I mean by virtue?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And what I mean by virtue is following</v>

696
00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:13.960
<v Speaker 6>whatever it is in your life that</v>
<v Speaker 6>manifests itself to you as meaningful</v>

697
00:47:14.270 --> 00:47:17.900
<v Speaker 6>and right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and there's Cota sales to that.</v>

698
00:47:17.901 --> 00:47:20.330
<v Speaker 6>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in order to determine clearly what's</v>

699
00:47:20.331 --> 00:47:23.510
<v Speaker 6>meaningful in right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you have to stop light because if you</v>

700
00:47:23.511 --> 00:47:25.460
<v Speaker 6>lie to yourself or you lie to other</v>
<v Speaker 6>people,</v>

701
00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:30.370
<v Speaker 6>you blind yourself and then the things</v>
<v Speaker 6>that might appear to you as meaningful</v>

702
00:47:30.370 --> 00:47:35.320
<v Speaker 7>or no longer trustworthy because you're</v>
<v Speaker 7>using an instrument that you voluntarily</v>

703
00:47:35.321 --> 00:47:40.321
<v Speaker 7>damaged to perceive reality and that</v>
<v Speaker 7>will lead you astray and virtue requires</v>

704
00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:45.100
<v Speaker 7>while requires humility because you have</v>
<v Speaker 7>to stop thinking that you know,</v>

705
00:47:45.580 --> 00:47:49.270
<v Speaker 7>and so humility and honesty are absolute</v>
<v Speaker 7>preconditions.</v>

706
00:47:49.450 --> 00:47:53.290
<v Speaker 7>Courage as well as necessary because</v>
<v Speaker 7>you'll have to learn to come to terms</v>

707
00:47:53.291 --> 00:47:58.150
<v Speaker 7>with your own capacity for anxiety and</v>
<v Speaker 7>dread and aggression and and even your</v>

708
00:47:58.151 --> 00:48:01.210
<v Speaker 7>capacity for welfare,</v>
<v Speaker 7>terrible acts,</v>

709
00:48:01.630 --> 00:48:06.630
<v Speaker 7>and to continually set yourself right is</v>
<v Speaker 7>to walk down the path I believe of moral</v>

710
00:48:07.301 --> 00:48:08.134
<v Speaker 7>virtue.</v>

711
00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:13.530
<v Speaker 5>I would contrast the difference between</v>
<v Speaker 5>having happiness as a desirable thing,</v>

712
00:48:13.871 --> 00:48:16.330
<v Speaker 5>which it's incredibly desirable to be</v>
<v Speaker 5>happy,</v>

713
00:48:16.570 --> 00:48:21.340
<v Speaker 5>but what I like to talk about is</v>
<v Speaker 5>thinking about this as a compass.</v>

714
00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:24.760
<v Speaker 5>Provide a navigator of which direction</v>
<v Speaker 5>to go into.</v>

715
00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:27.010
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't tell them what direction it</v>
<v Speaker 5>says,</v>

716
00:48:27.011 --> 00:48:31.420
<v Speaker 5>here's the direction that you're facing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If happiness is your compass to navigate</v>

717
00:48:31.421 --> 00:48:35.170
<v Speaker 5>through the complexities and ambiguities</v>
<v Speaker 5>of life,</v>

718
00:48:36.070 --> 00:48:39.850
<v Speaker 5>it means when something is negative or</v>
<v Speaker 5>problematic,</v>

719
00:48:40.210 --> 00:48:45.210
<v Speaker 5>that's the wrong direction to move into.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When it's your values become your</v>

720
00:48:45.461 --> 00:48:47.350
<v Speaker 5>compass,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's very different.</v>

721
00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:50.260
<v Speaker 5>Let me give you example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so one of my fundamental values,</v>

722
00:48:50.261 --> 00:48:54.550
<v Speaker 5>I have twin four year old girls,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is to try to be a good father and</v>

723
00:48:54.551 --> 00:48:59.551
<v Speaker 5>instill good values in them and try to</v>
<v Speaker 5>cultivate their strikes and so when I'm</v>

724
00:48:59.801 --> 00:49:02.470
<v Speaker 5>faced with conflicts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which we all are faced with,</v>

725
00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:06.010
<v Speaker 5>I love writing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love doing science.</v>

726
00:49:06.010 --> 00:49:09.520
<v Speaker 5>I loved teaching and I'm in the middle</v>
<v Speaker 5>of a great writing session.</v>

727
00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:11.920
<v Speaker 5>Eight hours.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm in flow of the words were just</v>

728
00:49:11.921 --> 00:49:15.850
<v Speaker 5>spilling out of my brain onto the page</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I looked at the clock and I realize</v>

729
00:49:15.851 --> 00:49:18.820
<v Speaker 5>it's almost time for their bedtime.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've got a conflict here.</v>

730
00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:23.290
<v Speaker 5>Do I continue with this incredible</v>
<v Speaker 5>writing session or do I make sure I've</v>

731
00:49:23.291 --> 00:49:25.090
<v Speaker 5>seen my kids before?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I let you go to sleep,</v>

732
00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:27.670
<v Speaker 5>read them a story,</v>
<v Speaker 5>tuck them in,</v>

733
00:49:28.150 --> 00:49:30.460
<v Speaker 5>show them some affection,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and maybe come back to this.</v>

734
00:49:30.490 --> 00:49:32.620
<v Speaker 5>Am I writing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Might not be as good afterwards.</v>

735
00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:38.170
<v Speaker 5>Knowing that my values are to trying to</v>
<v Speaker 5>be a good father and instill values in</v>

736
00:49:38.171 --> 00:49:41.660
<v Speaker 5>them helps me with the decision and it</v>
<v Speaker 5>helps them decide,</v>

737
00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:42.820
<v Speaker 5>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to go home,</v>

738
00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:46.540
<v Speaker 5>spend some time my children come back to</v>
<v Speaker 5>my work.</v>

739
00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:51.220
<v Speaker 5>If happiness is my objective,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it leaves me in a much bigger quandary</v>

740
00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:55.600
<v Speaker 5>of all of these conflicts of what do I</v>
<v Speaker 5>do with the limited amount of time and</v>

741
00:49:55.601 --> 00:50:00.100
<v Speaker 5>energy I have in any given day and all</v>
<v Speaker 5>of these competing things that are</v>

742
00:50:00.101 --> 00:50:04.660
<v Speaker 5>fighting for my attention,</v>
<v Speaker 5>meaning and purpose in life and values</v>

743
00:50:04.990 --> 00:50:06.850
<v Speaker 5>is a very stable compass.</v>

744
00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:11.080
<v Speaker 5>This is a way to create a life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to feel good about who we are,</v>

745
00:50:11.530 --> 00:50:16.090
<v Speaker 5>to have an understanding of what type of</v>
<v Speaker 5>person we want to be and try to close</v>

746
00:50:16.091 --> 00:50:19.180
<v Speaker 5>the gap between what we do and what we</v>
<v Speaker 5>strive to become.</v>

747
00:50:19.870 --> 00:50:24.730
<v Speaker 5>I want to make my personal signature on</v>
<v Speaker 5>my work so that I leave the world a</v>

748
00:50:24.731 --> 00:50:26.200
<v Speaker 5>little bit of a better place,</v>

749
00:50:37.390 --> 00:50:41.570
<v Speaker 7>deeply embedded again in western</v>
<v Speaker 7>religious thinking.</v>

750
00:50:41.571 --> 00:50:46.571
<v Speaker 7>That reality is in some sense incomplete</v>
<v Speaker 7>unfinished and the name of the human</v>

751
00:50:49.221 --> 00:50:51.500
<v Speaker 7>being is to complete it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>To perfect it,</v>

752
00:50:51.590 --> 00:50:56.590
<v Speaker 7>to finish it and see the idea that</v>
<v Speaker 7>reality is in some sense unfinished and</v>

753
00:50:58.130 --> 00:51:02.330
<v Speaker 7>hence it's tragic in an incomplete</v>
<v Speaker 7>manner and that the role of the human</v>

754
00:51:02.331 --> 00:51:07.331
<v Speaker 7>being is in some sense to participate in</v>
<v Speaker 7>its perfection is a concept that is so</v>

755
00:51:09.381 --> 00:51:14.381
<v Speaker 7>profound that it makes happiness as a</v>
<v Speaker 7>concept design to encapsulate the</v>

756
00:51:15.531 --> 00:51:20.300
<v Speaker 7>meaning of life so shallow that it</v>
<v Speaker 7>instantly becomes virtually negligible.</v>

757
00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:31.040
<v Speaker 6>We have a hypothesis here that the</v>
<v Speaker 6>purpose of conscious being is for those</v>

758
00:51:32.251 --> 00:51:36.690
<v Speaker 6>beings who are conscious to transcend</v>
<v Speaker 6>their mortar limitations and to work for</v>

759
00:51:36.691 --> 00:51:41.691
<v Speaker 6>the perfection of all that exists as a</v>
<v Speaker 6>goal that justifies suffering.</v>

760
00:51:42.630 --> 00:51:46.140
<v Speaker 6>That's unbeatable.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think because what it does is broaden</v>

761
00:51:46.141 --> 00:51:50.790
<v Speaker 6>and deepen your life in a manner that</v>
<v Speaker 6>you might compare to the difference</v>

762
00:51:50.791 --> 00:51:53.820
<v Speaker 6>between elevator music and a Beethoven</v>
<v Speaker 6>symphony.</v>

763
00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:59.360
<v Speaker 6>It's not that the symphony is in any</v>
<v Speaker 6>sense happier than the Muzak and in fact</v>

764
00:52:00.751 --> 00:52:03.150
<v Speaker 6>quite the contrary,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's deeper and more profound</v>

765
00:52:03.151 --> 00:52:07.140
<v Speaker 6>enricher and incorporates more and</v>
<v Speaker 6>justifies itself more.</v>

766
00:52:07.380 --> 00:52:10.980
<v Speaker 6>And that's the right metaphor for life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not Happiness,</v>

767
00:52:10.981 --> 00:52:15.981
<v Speaker 6>but but depth and and and differentiated</v>
<v Speaker 6>quality and profundity to match the</v>

768
00:52:17.401 --> 00:52:19.920
<v Speaker 6>profundity of the necessity of</v>
<v Speaker 6>suffering.</v>
