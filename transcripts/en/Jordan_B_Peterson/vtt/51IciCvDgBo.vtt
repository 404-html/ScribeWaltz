00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.620
<v Speaker 1>When you love someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you love them,</v>

2
00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:07.663
<v Speaker 1>not only despite their fragile it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also because of it wouldn't be who </v>

3
00:00:11.841 --> 00:00:16.520
<v Speaker 1>they were if they weren't fragile and </v>
<v Speaker 1>limited in their particular way.</v>

4
00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.170
<v Speaker 1>When you have a sick kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

5
00:00:18.171 --> 00:00:21.020
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can the world be constituted so that</v>

6
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.690
<v Speaker 1>a child can unfairly suffered in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>map?</v>

7
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.823
<v Speaker 1>You can't have them being vulnerable and</v>
<v Speaker 1>cute and interesting and small and </v>

8
00:00:28.581 --> 00:00:31.610
<v Speaker 1>needing care,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but striving to develop and grow without</v>

9
00:00:31.611 --> 00:00:35.120
<v Speaker 1>them also being prone to pain and </v>
<v Speaker 1>destruction and vulnerability,</v>

10
00:00:35.121 --> 00:00:37.430
<v Speaker 1>and then what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Teach them to be strong.</v>

11
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.040
<v Speaker 1>That's what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't get rid of the vulnerability.</v>

12
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.040
<v Speaker 1>It teach them to be strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't protect your children.</v>

13
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:44.630
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do.</v>

14
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:45.463
<v Speaker 1>You do the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You expose them to the world as much as </v>

15
00:00:47.091 --> 00:00:49.280
<v Speaker 1>you possibly can and you make them </v>
<v Speaker 1>strong.</v>

16
00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.560
<v Speaker 1>That's the best antidote to their </v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability.</v>

17
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.590
<v Speaker 1>The first noble truth of Buddhism life </v>
<v Speaker 1>is suffering.</v>

18
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:55.783
<v Speaker 1>This is true and it's worse than that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's suffering contaminated by </v>

19
00:00:58.941 --> 00:01:01.220
<v Speaker 1>malevolence and so that's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>pessimistic,</v>

20
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.430
<v Speaker 1>but the optimistic part is that you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>so damn tough.</v>

21
00:01:04.431 --> 00:01:06.050
<v Speaker 1>You can actually know that we deal with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

22
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.080
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's a horrible situation,</v>

23
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.390
<v Speaker 1>but it turns out that I'm armed for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>task.</v>

24
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.580
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a great thing for people.</v>

25
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.590
<v Speaker 1>I think the fact that we're armed for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the task is even more true than the fact</v>

26
00:01:20.591 --> 00:01:21.424
<v Speaker 1>that life is catastrophe contaminated by</v>
<v Speaker 1>malevolence were stronger than things </v>

27
00:01:25.241 --> 00:01:26.074
<v Speaker 1>are terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do believe it's the case because I've </v>

28
00:01:28.151 --> 00:01:28.984
<v Speaker 1>watched people do very difficult things </v>
<v Speaker 1>like people who work in palliative care </v>

29
00:01:31.451 --> 00:01:32.284
<v Speaker 1>wards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so all they're ever dealing with his </v>

30
00:01:33.641 --> 00:01:35.110
<v Speaker 1>pain and death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

31
00:01:35.111 --> 00:01:37.660
<v Speaker 1>and they can do it and get up in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>morning.</v>

32
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.850
<v Speaker 1>They go to work and they take care of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those people.</v>

33
00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.300
<v Speaker 1>They lose people on a weekly basis and </v>
<v Speaker 1>yet they can do it,</v>

34
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:44.553
<v Speaker 1>and what that shows is that if you turn </v>
<v Speaker 1>around and you confront the suffering </v>

35
00:01:48.221 --> 00:01:51.490
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily who find out that you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>way tougher than you think.</v>

36
00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.680
<v Speaker 1>It's not that life is better than you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>

37
00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.830
<v Speaker 1>Life isn't as harsh as you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might even be worse,</v>

38
00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.880
<v Speaker 1>but you are way tougher than you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you turn around and confronted,</v>

39
00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.480
<v Speaker 1>it's a very good thing to know and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not naive optimism.</v>

40
00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.430
<v Speaker 1>It's a very different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

41
00:02:06.431 --> 00:02:07.960
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things are terrible.</v>

42
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:10.330
<v Speaker 1>They are brutal and you are so damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>tough.</v>

43
00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:11.440
<v Speaker 1>You can't believe it.</v>
