1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.710
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you can't tell,</v>

2
00:00:01.711 --> 00:00:05.370
<v Speaker 1>but you're looking at a new and improved</v>
<v Speaker 1>version of me today because I just</v>

3
00:00:05.371 --> 00:00:09.210
<v Speaker 1>finished the Canadian government's</v>
<v Speaker 1>online ethics course and so my,</v>

4
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.930
<v Speaker 1>my capacity to manifest ethical behavior</v>
<v Speaker 1>has been improved by an immeasurable</v>

5
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:16.343
<v Speaker 1>amount.</v>

6
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:17.543
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

7
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:22.180
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so today we're gonna.</v>

8
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.370
<v Speaker 1>Talk about something that's actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite controversial,</v>

9
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.990
<v Speaker 1>although I guess what we talked about</v>
<v Speaker 1>last lecture was rather controversial to</v>

10
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.510
<v Speaker 1>people hate this topic generally</v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking,</v>

11
00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.410
<v Speaker 1>and it's because like there's nothing</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>

12
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.400
<v Speaker 1>There's never any guarantee that if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>investigate things from a scientific</v>

13
00:00:44.401 --> 00:00:48.150
<v Speaker 1>perspective that you're going to learn</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you want to learn or that</v>

14
00:00:48.151 --> 00:00:51.300
<v Speaker 1>you're happy about knowing or that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>wish were that way.</v>

15
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say one of the big advantages to</v>

16
00:00:53.761 --> 00:00:57.720
<v Speaker 1>the scientific method is that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>presents you with data that you don't</v>

17
00:00:57.721 --> 00:00:58.554
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

18
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:00.563
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

19
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.670
<v Speaker 1>Be Most of the time when you learn</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

20
00:01:02.671 --> 00:01:06.600
<v Speaker 1>it's because you're running into</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that you don't like or don't</v>

21
00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:07.500
<v Speaker 1>want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

22
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.000
<v Speaker 1>Because otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the world is unfolding in front of</v>

23
00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:14.070
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly as you predict and hope there's</v>

24
00:01:14.071 --> 00:01:17.130
<v Speaker 1>nothing to learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you almost always run into an impediment</v>

25
00:01:17.131 --> 00:01:19.410
<v Speaker 1>of one form or another before you ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn anything.</v>

26
00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.470
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to talk about openness</v>
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

27
00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.850
<v Speaker 1>how that sounds rather innocuous in and</v>
<v Speaker 1>of itself,</v>

28
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.880
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>openness is the place in the big five</v>

29
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.090
<v Speaker 1>were Iq hides,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially</v>

30
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.420
<v Speaker 1>nonverbal Iq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is most specifically associated</v>

31
00:01:43.421 --> 00:01:46.290
<v Speaker 1>with fluid Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How?</v>

32
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.710
<v Speaker 1>The thing about intelligence is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like the big five,</v>

33
00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.480
<v Speaker 1>it's unit dimensional in most regards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know if you do the proper factor</v>

34
00:01:55.481 --> 00:01:59.680
<v Speaker 1>analysis with the entire Corpus of trait</v>
<v Speaker 1>descriptors in language,</v>

35
00:01:59.681 --> 00:02:02.950
<v Speaker 1>you end up with five dimensions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no superordinate single</v>

36
00:02:02.951 --> 00:02:06.070
<v Speaker 1>dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can make a case for plasticity and</v>

37
00:02:06.071 --> 00:02:09.340
<v Speaker 1>stability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the actual utility of that higher</v>

38
00:02:09.341 --> 00:02:14.341
<v Speaker 1>order factor structure has yet to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>demonstrated in a multiplicity of</v>

39
00:02:15.851 --> 00:02:19.840
<v Speaker 1>situations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have some evidence for with regards</v>

40
00:02:19.841 --> 00:02:23.770
<v Speaker 1>to plasticity and stability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That plasticity is predicted more by</v>

41
00:02:23.771 --> 00:02:28.690
<v Speaker 1>what people do and stability is much</v>
<v Speaker 1>more predicted by what people don't do.</v>

42
00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.100
<v Speaker 1>Now I don't know how useful that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's kind of an interesting fact.</v>

43
00:02:33.101 --> 00:02:35.980
<v Speaker 1>It was an incredibly powerful effect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

44
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm plasticity seems to be associated</v>
<v Speaker 1>more with exploratory behavior and</v>

45
00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.680
<v Speaker 1>perhaps with dopaminergic function and</v>
<v Speaker 1>stability,</v>

46
00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.120
<v Speaker 1>perhaps more with the control and</v>
<v Speaker 1>constraint of behavior and Sarah Tender</v>

47
00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.740
<v Speaker 1>Jake function,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's still pretty vague,</v>

48
00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.430
<v Speaker 1>so you can certainly make a case for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>

49
00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.670
<v Speaker 1>For the hierarchy of factor structure</v>
<v Speaker 1>with regards to trades to of top out at</v>

50
00:03:00.191 --> 00:03:04.810
<v Speaker 1>the five factor level with some</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility of a of an informative level</v>

51
00:03:04.811 --> 00:03:08.410
<v Speaker 1>above that</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideal isn't like that.</v>

52
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:14.490
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty damn unit dimensional and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's complicated because there does seem</v>

53
00:03:15.761 --> 00:03:19.690
<v Speaker 1>to be some utility in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in distinguishing between verbal and</v>

54
00:03:19.691 --> 00:03:23.500
<v Speaker 1>nonverbal intelligence or fluid in</v>
<v Speaker 1>crystallized intelligence depending on</v>

55
00:03:23.501 --> 00:03:25.930
<v Speaker 1>how you look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the distinction is basically</v>

56
00:03:25.931 --> 00:03:30.931
<v Speaker 1>this is the fluid intelligence roughly</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a measure of how rapidly you can</v>

57
00:03:31.391 --> 00:03:36.391
<v Speaker 1>learn things and then crystallized</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence roughly is an indication of</v>

58
00:03:36.431 --> 00:03:40.390
<v Speaker 1>how much you've learned and then you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>see why those two things would be very</v>

59
00:03:40.391 --> 00:03:41.410
<v Speaker 1>highly correlated.</v>

60
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.680
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because how much you know is obviously</v>

61
00:03:44.681 --> 00:03:47.170
<v Speaker 1>going to be a function of how fast you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can learn,</v>

62
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.100
<v Speaker 1>but you could also see that there would</v>
<v Speaker 1>be some circumstances under which those</v>

63
00:03:51.101 --> 00:03:54.070
<v Speaker 1>two things could be dissociated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that happens,</v>

64
00:03:54.071 --> 00:03:56.350
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you get older,</v>

65
00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:01.120
<v Speaker 1>your fluid Iq drops quite precipitously</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it starts doing that somewhere in</v>

66
00:04:01.121 --> 00:04:04.120
<v Speaker 1>your mid twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's some of you are already</v>

67
00:04:04.121 --> 00:04:07.390
<v Speaker 1>getting stupider,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of annoying at least from</v>

68
00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.710
<v Speaker 1>the perspective of the ability to learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're crystallized Iq or your</v>

69
00:04:11.711 --> 00:04:13.750
<v Speaker 1>verbal Iq depending on how you look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

70
00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.700
<v Speaker 1>can continue to rise for the rest of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life as you put more information</v>

71
00:04:18.701 --> 00:04:20.080
<v Speaker 1>into yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

72
00:04:20.081 --> 00:04:25.081
<v Speaker 1>And some of that might be a measurement</v>
<v Speaker 1>artifact somewhat because the way that</v>

73
00:04:25.451 --> 00:04:29.860
<v Speaker 1>you test verbal or crystallized</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence generally is by asking</v>

74
00:04:29.861 --> 00:04:33.520
<v Speaker 1>people about their knowledge of</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

75
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.470
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's their vocabulary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

76
00:04:35.471 --> 00:04:38.650
<v Speaker 1>which is an excellent measure of verbal</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence as you might expect,</v>

77
00:04:38.651 --> 00:04:41.260
<v Speaker 1>probably because it's an index of how</v>
<v Speaker 1>much people read.</v>

78
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.980
<v Speaker 1>That would be my guess or general</v>
<v Speaker 1>inflammation tests.</v>

79
00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.580
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what a sample of your required</v>

80
00:04:48.581 --> 00:04:51.170
<v Speaker 1>factual knowledge and so forth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

81
00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.670
<v Speaker 1>that sort of thing can increase as you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you age,</v>

82
00:04:54.671 --> 00:04:59.590
<v Speaker 1>as your ability to learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>decreases the best way.</v>

83
00:04:59.591 --> 00:05:02.150
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to keep your intelligence in</v>

84
00:05:02.151 --> 00:05:05.080
<v Speaker 1>tact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best way to do that is to,</v>

85
00:05:05.081 --> 00:05:08.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to exercise just so you know it.</v>

86
00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.160
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both weightlifting and</v>

87
00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:20.220
<v Speaker 1>cardiovascular exercise can maintain</v>
<v Speaker 1>your fluid intelligence to quite a</v>

88
00:05:21.341 --> 00:05:23.650
<v Speaker 1>remarkable degree across the course of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life.</v>

89
00:05:23.651 --> 00:05:27.040
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that likely is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain is a pretty vascularized</v>

90
00:05:27.041 --> 00:05:31.450
<v Speaker 1>Oregon and use uses a tremendous amount</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your body's oxygen and energy.</v>

91
00:05:31.451 --> 00:05:35.650
<v Speaker 1>And so if your cardiovascular system</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't in that good a shape than what</v>

92
00:05:35.651 --> 00:05:39.760
<v Speaker 1>seems to happen is that it's harder for</v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain to get rid of waste products</v>

93
00:05:39.761 --> 00:05:43.660
<v Speaker 1>that are produced during.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's during it's metabolic processes.</v>

94
00:05:43.661 --> 00:05:48.661
<v Speaker 1>And so you can't work as efficiently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not a lot of evidence that brain</v>

95
00:05:48.971 --> 00:05:53.950
<v Speaker 1>games of one form or another can produce</v>
<v Speaker 1>any real positive effect.</v>

96
00:05:53.951 --> 00:05:57.080
<v Speaker 1>Although they're scattered reports in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the literature that video games can</v>

97
00:05:57.081 --> 00:05:57.914
<v Speaker 1>improve,</v>

98
00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:04.140
<v Speaker 1>that can improve spatial intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a subset of intelligence,</v>

99
00:06:04.141 --> 00:06:08.430
<v Speaker 1>even though it's very highly correlated</v>
<v Speaker 1>with fluid intelligence in domains other</v>

100
00:06:08.431 --> 00:06:10.320
<v Speaker 1>than the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually what happens if you.</v>

101
00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:13.950
<v Speaker 1>If you get people to develop expertise</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a game that requires abstract</v>

102
00:06:13.951 --> 00:06:15.180
<v Speaker 1>ability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a video game,</v>

103
00:06:15.181 --> 00:06:18.030
<v Speaker 1>what happens is they get tremendously</v>
<v Speaker 1>better at the thing that they're</v>

104
00:06:18.031 --> 00:06:20.520
<v Speaker 1>practicing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there doesn't seem to be a lot of</v>

105
00:06:20.521 --> 00:06:25.521
<v Speaker 1>transfer of ability to different games</v>
<v Speaker 1>and and what fluid intelligence is in</v>

106
00:06:26.041 --> 00:06:30.120
<v Speaker 1>large part is what's common across</v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple.</v>

107
00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:33.840
<v Speaker 1>The ability that's common across</v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple complex tasks,</v>

108
00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:38.160
<v Speaker 1>whatever that ability happens to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we don't know exactly what that</v>

109
00:06:38.161 --> 00:06:42.600
<v Speaker 1>ability is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because we don't really know very</v>

110
00:06:42.601 --> 00:06:45.420
<v Speaker 1>much about how the brain works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we definitely know how to measure it</v>

111
00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:46.770
<v Speaker 1>and that irritates people.</v>

112
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:55.460
<v Speaker 1>So Iq fits under openness and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>terminology is still a little bit,</v>

113
00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:00.830
<v Speaker 1>I would say awkward</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a while when people were trying to</v>

114
00:07:00.831 --> 00:07:04.640
<v Speaker 1>sort out what the fifth factor was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the openness factor.</v>

115
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:09.260
<v Speaker 1>Some people thought about it as</v>
<v Speaker 1>intellect and some people thought about</v>

116
00:07:09.261 --> 00:07:12.710
<v Speaker 1>it as openness and it it ended up being</v>
<v Speaker 1>named openness.</v>

117
00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:16.220
<v Speaker 1>When we did our aspect study back in</v>
<v Speaker 1>2007,</v>

118
00:07:16.221 --> 00:07:20.720
<v Speaker 1>we broke it up into openness to</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience proper and intellect.</v>

119
00:07:20.721 --> 00:07:25.640
<v Speaker 1>So those seem to be aspects of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher order trait and the aspect level</v>

120
00:07:25.641 --> 00:07:28.910
<v Speaker 1>differentiation actually turned out to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be realm rather useful,</v>

121
00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:32.090
<v Speaker 1>at least at least so far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things we just published a</v>

122
00:07:32.091 --> 00:07:35.630
<v Speaker 1>study for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>showing that if you are higher in</v>

123
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:40.040
<v Speaker 1>openness to experience the aspect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were more likely to be in the</v>

124
00:07:40.041 --> 00:07:43.310
<v Speaker 1>humanities and if you were hiring</v>
<v Speaker 1>intellect you are more likely to be in</v>

125
00:07:43.311 --> 00:07:44.690
<v Speaker 1>the sciences for example.</v>

126
00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:48.710
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we'll do first is we're going to</v>

127
00:07:48.711 --> 00:07:50.960
<v Speaker 1>talk a little bit about intelligence per</v>
<v Speaker 1>se,</v>

128
00:07:50.961 --> 00:07:55.340
<v Speaker 1>and then we'll talk about the trait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason I want to talk about Iq</v>

129
00:07:55.341 --> 00:07:57.290
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because really that's what I'm talking</v>

130
00:07:57.291 --> 00:08:01.730
<v Speaker 1>about is because the best measure of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>intellect aspect isn't a big five</v>

131
00:08:01.731 --> 00:08:05.450
<v Speaker 1>personality questionnaire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually an Iq test and so and it's</v>

132
00:08:05.451 --> 00:08:07.550
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very important to understand ICU and</v>

133
00:08:07.551 --> 00:08:11.210
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of reasons for this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First reason is that Iq is more</v>

134
00:08:11.211 --> 00:08:16.211
<v Speaker 1>powerfully predictive of long term life</v>
<v Speaker 1>success than any other phenomena that</v>

135
00:08:16.401 --> 00:08:21.401
<v Speaker 1>can be measured among human beings and</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>

136
00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:27.820
<v Speaker 1>the statistics that were derived</v>
<v Speaker 1>statistics that were used to derive Iq</v>

137
00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:33.190
<v Speaker 1>tests and then use to predict future</v>
<v Speaker 1>performance are exactly the same</v>

138
00:08:33.621 --> 00:08:37.160
<v Speaker 1>statistics that every social scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly psychologists,</v>

139
00:08:37.161 --> 00:08:41.030
<v Speaker 1>every social scientist uses to do all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their statistics.</v>

140
00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:46.330
<v Speaker 1>So you can't criticize that derivation</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Iq tests on statistical grounds</v>

141
00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:51.890
<v Speaker 1>without criticizing every single finding</v>
<v Speaker 1>in psychology that's ever been made by</v>

142
00:08:51.891 --> 00:08:52.760
<v Speaker 1>anyone ever since.</v>

143
00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:56.130
<v Speaker 1>We started to use statistics and I would</v>
<v Speaker 1>say not only that,</v>

144
00:08:56.131 --> 00:09:00.600
<v Speaker 1>the best statisticians that psychology</v>
<v Speaker 1>has ever produced are the people who</v>

145
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:05.370
<v Speaker 1>invented and promoted and developed and</v>
<v Speaker 1>tested Iq tests.</v>

146
00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:08.670
<v Speaker 1>So there's no getting out of it by</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying that there's something,</v>

147
00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:13.740
<v Speaker 1>something faulty about the statistics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

148
00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:17.640
<v Speaker 1>Stephen Jay Gould,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is a famous evolutionary biologist</v>

149
00:09:17.641 --> 00:09:22.260
<v Speaker 1>and pretty radical left wing thinker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He debated.</v>

150
00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:26.130
<v Speaker 1>He had a public debate at one point</v>
<v Speaker 1>about what he called the mismeasure of</v>

151
00:09:26.131 --> 00:09:30.570
<v Speaker 1>man because he wasn't very much of a fan</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Iq tests and he claimed that Iq tests</v>

152
00:09:30.571 --> 00:09:34.860
<v Speaker 1>were faulty because they relied on</v>
<v Speaker 1>factor analysis and because basically</v>

153
00:09:34.861 --> 00:09:39.861
<v Speaker 1>what Iq is is the first factor that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>draw out of a huge battery of questions</v>

154
00:09:42.211 --> 00:09:45.180
<v Speaker 1>that require abstraction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any kinds of questions you'll find that</v>

155
00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:48.450
<v Speaker 1>if people do well on one question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tend to do well at all the other</v>

156
00:09:48.451 --> 00:09:49.230
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>

157
00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:52.140
<v Speaker 1>That's the general factor and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

158
00:09:52.141 --> 00:09:55.710
<v Speaker 1>that's just a factor and that's means</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a mathematical abstraction and that</v>

159
00:09:55.711 --> 00:09:57.630
<v Speaker 1>means that it's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

160
00:09:57.631 --> 00:09:58.620
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

161
00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:04.040
<v Speaker 1>the first factor that you derive out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the performance indices for our very</v>

162
00:10:04.501 --> 00:10:07.050
<v Speaker 1>large number of answers to abstract</v>
<v Speaker 1>questions,</v>

163
00:10:07.051 --> 00:10:09.840
<v Speaker 1>it's almost perfectly correlated with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the average.</v>

164
00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:13.020
<v Speaker 1>The mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that's tantamount to saying that</v>

165
00:10:13.021 --> 00:10:17.350
<v Speaker 1>the mean is a mathematical abstraction</v>
<v Speaker 1>and therefore doesn't really exist and</v>

166
00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:19.320
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you have a problem which is.</v>

167
00:10:19.321 --> 00:10:20.131
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

168
00:10:20.131 --> 00:10:23.970
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean by exists?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you can certainly make a case</v>

169
00:10:23.971 --> 00:10:27.080
<v Speaker 1>that mathematical abstractions are more</v>
<v Speaker 1>real than the thing that they're</v>

170
00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:29.490
<v Speaker 1>abstracted from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that wasn't the case,</v>

171
00:10:29.491 --> 00:10:31.470
<v Speaker 1>then mathematics wouldn't be so</v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful.</v>

172
00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:35.070
<v Speaker 1>So basically Gould's argument boiled</v>
<v Speaker 1>down to the idea that there's no such</v>

173
00:10:35.071 --> 00:10:37.140
<v Speaker 1>thing as an average.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

174
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:41.790
<v Speaker 1>this is part of what makes me a</v>
<v Speaker 1>pragmatist philosophically.</v>

175
00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:45.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean there is such thing as an average</v>
<v Speaker 1>in so far as calculating the average and</v>

176
00:10:45.571 --> 00:10:49.860
<v Speaker 1>then using it produces certain results</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you desire in order to deal with</v>

177
00:10:49.861 --> 00:10:51.060
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

178
00:10:51.061 --> 00:10:55.350
<v Speaker 1>So the average of a group of numbers is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a tool of some sort and you know,</v>

179
00:10:55.351 --> 00:10:58.410
<v Speaker 1>it's obviously doesn't contain all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>information that the entire set of</v>

180
00:10:58.411 --> 00:11:02.850
<v Speaker 1>numbers contained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need at least a standard deviation</v>

181
00:11:02.851 --> 00:11:05.030
<v Speaker 1>to get at that as well because that</v>
<v Speaker 1>talks to you about the,</v>

182
00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:06.160
<v Speaker 1>the range.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

183
00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:09.500
<v Speaker 1>the variability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that the average isn't a</v>

184
00:11:09.501 --> 00:11:12.360
<v Speaker 1>real thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

185
00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.630
<v Speaker 1>it's silly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

186
00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:17.940
<v Speaker 1>it's a shallow criticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also based on complete lack of</v>

187
00:11:17.941 --> 00:11:20.970
<v Speaker 1>knowledge about exactly what factor</v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis does and doesn't do.</v>

188
00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:26.360
<v Speaker 1>So now</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a list of some inter correlations</v>

189
00:11:31.031 --> 00:11:35.110
<v Speaker 1>here between the various facets or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>various aspects,</v>

190
00:11:35.111 --> 00:11:37.630
<v Speaker 1>just so you know how tightly associated</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are.</v>

191
00:11:37.631 --> 00:11:42.280
<v Speaker 1>So industrious and industriousness and</v>
<v Speaker 1>orderliness or correlated at about point</v>

192
00:11:42.281 --> 00:11:44.890
<v Speaker 1>four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's from conscientiousness,</v>

193
00:11:44.891 --> 00:11:48.040
<v Speaker 1>volatility and emotional stability at</v>
<v Speaker 1>about point five,</v>

194
00:11:48.041 --> 00:11:50.920
<v Speaker 1>nine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Politeness and compassion out about</v>

195
00:11:50.921 --> 00:11:51.940
<v Speaker 1>point four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four.</v>

196
00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:59.580
<v Speaker 1>Assertiveness and enthusiasm at about</v>
<v Speaker 1>point four slash seven.</v>

197
00:11:59.581 --> 00:12:03.240
<v Speaker 1>And openness and intelligence about</v>
<v Speaker 1>point three five.</v>

198
00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:08.840
<v Speaker 1>So openness and intelligence seemed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be somewhat maximally differentiated as</v>

199
00:12:09.871 --> 00:12:13.560
<v Speaker 1>far as aspects Go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the average correlation between the</v>

200
00:12:13.561 --> 00:12:15.810
<v Speaker 1>big five is our equals point two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two.</v>

201
00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:19.350
<v Speaker 1>And the correlation between the big two</v>
<v Speaker 1>is our equals point to four.</v>

202
00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:24.950
<v Speaker 1>So God just gives you some idea of how</v>
<v Speaker 1>much segregation and how much overlap</v>

203
00:12:25.021 --> 00:12:27.870
<v Speaker 1>there is between the different aspects</v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath the trait level.</v>

204
00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:35.560
<v Speaker 3>Let's see.</v>

205
00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:52.700
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I should really tell you first I</v>

206
00:12:52.701 --> 00:12:55.820
<v Speaker 1>guess is how is how to conceptualize</v>
<v Speaker 1>ICU.</v>

207
00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a good one.</v>

208
00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:03.830
<v Speaker 1>So you want to follow this carefully so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that so that you,</v>

209
00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:07.040
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can explain it to yourself and so</v>

210
00:13:07.041 --> 00:13:08.950
<v Speaker 1>that you can explain it to other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here,</v>

211
00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:12.860
<v Speaker 1>let's say you want to make an Iq test,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is what an Iq test is.</v>

212
00:13:12.861 --> 00:13:15.380
<v Speaker 1>The first thing you might imagine that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that</v>

213
00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:22.020
<v Speaker 1>you have a huge library of questions and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there'll be questions that could be</v>

214
00:13:22.021 --> 00:13:24.780
<v Speaker 1>formulated in language or some other</v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolic manner.</v>

215
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:29.870
<v Speaker 1>Often they don't have to be but often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they require skill or knowledge</v>

216
00:13:30.451 --> 00:13:34.230
<v Speaker 1>to answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's some typical questions and you</v>

217
00:13:34.231 --> 00:13:37.260
<v Speaker 1>can generate multiple exemplars of</v>
<v Speaker 1>questions like this.</v>

218
00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:40.620
<v Speaker 1>What's two times 68?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the capital of Georgia?</v>

219
00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:43.440
<v Speaker 1>How do you fight?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you define hyper tricks?</v>

220
00:13:43.441 --> 00:13:44.860
<v Speaker 1>Anemia?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

221
00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:47.700
<v Speaker 1>complete the pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two,</v>

222
00:13:47.701 --> 00:13:48.421
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>

223
00:13:48.421 --> 00:13:50.970
<v Speaker 1>16.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember these numbers?</v>

224
00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:52.050
<v Speaker 1>Two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four.</v>

225
00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.390
<v Speaker 1>Then you'd tell them back to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>

226
00:13:54.391 --> 00:13:55.290
<v Speaker 1>12,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15,</v>

227
00:13:55.291 --> 00:13:56.220
<v Speaker 1>14,</v>
<v Speaker 1>18,</v>

228
00:13:56.221 --> 00:13:57.360
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>22.</v>

229
00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:00.570
<v Speaker 1>You tell them back to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a working memory task by the way.</v>

230
00:14:00.571 --> 00:14:04.590
<v Speaker 1>But working memory is basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>indistinguishable from intelligence in</v>

231
00:14:04.591 --> 00:14:05.424
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many ways.</v>

232
00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:07.590
<v Speaker 1>So then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

233
00:14:07.591 --> 00:14:09.510
<v Speaker 1>another thing I might have you do for</v>
<v Speaker 1>examples,</v>

234
00:14:09.511 --> 00:14:14.040
<v Speaker 1>I might show you a pattern made out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>squares and then give you some blocks</v>

235
00:14:14.041 --> 00:14:16.590
<v Speaker 1>and so that you could make the pattern</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the blocks.</v>

236
00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:19.440
<v Speaker 1>And then time you to see how long it</v>
<v Speaker 1>took you,</v>

237
00:14:19.441 --> 00:14:23.610
<v Speaker 1>or maybe I'm only giving you a certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of time and if you didn't do it,</v>

238
00:14:23.611 --> 00:14:25.870
<v Speaker 1>then you either pass or fail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

239
00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:29.670
<v Speaker 1>I might show you some patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is like a Raven's progressive</v>

240
00:14:29.671 --> 00:14:33.060
<v Speaker 1>matrices test,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the most tests that is</v>

241
00:14:33.061 --> 00:14:37.590
<v Speaker 1>the most accurate at assessing nonverbal</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence or fluid intelligence.</v>

242
00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:42.210
<v Speaker 1>So I might show you six patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six designs.</v>

243
00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:44.700
<v Speaker 1>Each design changes are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

244
00:14:44.701 --> 00:14:46.100
<v Speaker 1>eight designs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that,</v>

245
00:14:46.101 --> 00:14:48.420
<v Speaker 1>three by three array,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three here,</v>

246
00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:50.460
<v Speaker 1>three here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two here,</v>

247
00:14:50.461 --> 00:14:53.390
<v Speaker 1>and a question mark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then over here I'd show you a bunch</v>

248
00:14:53.391 --> 00:14:56.870
<v Speaker 1>of options of patterns and one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns would complete the sequence and</v>

249
00:14:56.871 --> 00:15:01.080
<v Speaker 1>usually you could calculate the sequence</v>
<v Speaker 1>going down or across and,</v>

250
00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:04.610
<v Speaker 1>and diagonally as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that looks somewhat like a working</v>

251
00:15:04.611 --> 00:15:09.410
<v Speaker 1>memory task in that usually the Raven's</v>
<v Speaker 1>progressive matrices patterns involve a</v>

252
00:15:09.411 --> 00:15:13.250
<v Speaker 1>couple of different variables,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it might be color and shape or</v>

253
00:15:13.251 --> 00:15:17.330
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so in order to complete the task,</v>

254
00:15:17.331 --> 00:15:20.630
<v Speaker 1>you have to figure out how the color is</v>
<v Speaker 1>transforming and figure out how the</v>

255
00:15:20.631 --> 00:15:24.170
<v Speaker 1>shape is transforming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe in a more complex Raven's</v>

256
00:15:24.171 --> 00:15:27.740
<v Speaker 1>matrices question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be color,</v>

257
00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:31.730
<v Speaker 1>shape and position on the page or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

258
00:15:31.731 --> 00:15:34.700
<v Speaker 1>So you're increasing the number of</v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensions that have to be attended to</v>

259
00:15:34.701 --> 00:15:37.370
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously in order to solve the</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

260
00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:38.743
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

261
00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:43.350
<v Speaker 1>so one of the things that's quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting about the Iq test,</v>

262
00:15:43.351 --> 00:15:46.700
<v Speaker 1>it really doesn't matter what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>questions are and so.</v>

263
00:15:46.701 --> 00:15:48.890
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so imagine you have a whole pile of</v>

264
00:15:48.891 --> 00:15:51.980
<v Speaker 1>these questions lying around like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>universal pile,</v>

265
00:15:51.981 --> 00:15:56.780
<v Speaker 1>well universal library of potential</v>
<v Speaker 1>questions that require abstraction to</v>

266
00:15:56.781 --> 00:15:59.990
<v Speaker 1>solve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you take a random set of 100 of</v>

267
00:15:59.991 --> 00:16:04.991
<v Speaker 1>those and then you give that to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand people and then you just score</v>

268
00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:11.020
<v Speaker 1>some up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just sum up their scores.</v>

269
00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:16.110
<v Speaker 1>Then you rank order them in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their performance.</v>

270
00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:20.190
<v Speaker 1>And that's Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's as simple as that.</v>

271
00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:25.080
<v Speaker 1>Now you could do some other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could correct it for the age of the</v>

272
00:16:25.081 --> 00:16:28.100
<v Speaker 1>participant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now sometimes that's useful and</v>

273
00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:31.380
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you could do that.</v>

274
00:16:31.381 --> 00:16:35.220
<v Speaker 1>And generally if you standardize the</v>
<v Speaker 1>score and you correct it for age than</v>

275
00:16:35.221 --> 00:16:40.221
<v Speaker 1>what you get as an Iq score,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say so actually the the total</v>

276
00:16:40.411 --> 00:16:42.930
<v Speaker 1>would just be an indicator of general</v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitive ability.</v>

277
00:16:42.931 --> 00:16:47.400
<v Speaker 1>The IQ score would be the indicator of</v>
<v Speaker 1>general cognitive ability corrected for</v>

278
00:16:47.401 --> 00:16:49.380
<v Speaker 1>age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's it.</v>

279
00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:53.160
<v Speaker 1>That's all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so here's some of the strange</v>

280
00:16:53.161 --> 00:16:54.900
<v Speaker 1>properties of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

281
00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:58.620
<v Speaker 1>of that set of scores.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you factor analyze the data set,</v>

282
00:16:58.621 --> 00:17:02.640
<v Speaker 1>you'll pull out one factor and a few</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bitty factors after that.</v>

283
00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:07.440
<v Speaker 1>And that factor will be very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very highly correlated with the sub so</v>

284
00:17:07.441 --> 00:17:09.590
<v Speaker 1>correlated at point nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>point nine,</v>

285
00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:10.740
<v Speaker 1>two point nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

286
00:17:10.741 --> 00:17:14.430
<v Speaker 1>like really highly correlated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>far more highly correlated.</v>

287
00:17:14.431 --> 00:17:16.500
<v Speaker 1>Then most tests are</v>

288
00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:22.680
<v Speaker 1>far more highly correlated that most</v>
<v Speaker 1>tests are reliable.</v>

289
00:17:23.610 --> 00:17:26.250
<v Speaker 1>Now another thing that's very</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting is you've taken another set</v>

290
00:17:26.251 --> 00:17:30.360
<v Speaker 1>of 100 questions and you give them to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same thousand people and then you</v>

291
00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:33.630
<v Speaker 1>rank order the people and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>correlate the rank orders.</v>

292
00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:37.080
<v Speaker 1>You get what I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the correlation between the rank order.</v>

293
00:17:37.081 --> 00:17:41.220
<v Speaker 1>So be like point nine five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what it means is no matter which set</v>

294
00:17:41.221 --> 00:17:44.730
<v Speaker 1>of 100 questions you take out of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>universal library of questions,</v>

295
00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:48.600
<v Speaker 1>people are going to score in the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>order that they scored when they did the</v>

296
00:17:48.601 --> 00:17:52.590
<v Speaker 1>first hundred questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that means that Iq is extremely</v>

297
00:17:52.591 --> 00:17:53.910
<v Speaker 1>reliable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>test,</v>

298
00:17:53.911 --> 00:17:55.260
<v Speaker 1>retest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reliability.</v>

299
00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:58.830
<v Speaker 1>This is actually even strip more</v>
<v Speaker 1>stringent form of reliability,</v>

300
00:17:58.831 --> 00:18:03.831
<v Speaker 1>which is alternative forum reliability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's all there is to our ICU.</v>

301
00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:11.030
<v Speaker 1>It's very simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now why it is that the ability to do</v>

302
00:18:13.641 --> 00:18:17.000
<v Speaker 1>well on one of those questions is highly</v>
<v Speaker 1>correlated with the ability to do all</v>

303
00:18:17.001 --> 00:18:19.610
<v Speaker 1>the rest of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's something that nobody really</v>

304
00:18:19.611 --> 00:18:22.520
<v Speaker 1>understands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it has to do with the human</v>

305
00:18:22.521 --> 00:18:26.210
<v Speaker 1>capacity to abstract.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we can abstract and we can</v>

306
00:18:26.211 --> 00:18:29.030
<v Speaker 1>manipulate abstractions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not obvious that there's any other</v>

307
00:18:29.031 --> 00:18:33.710
<v Speaker 1>creatures that can do that and it seems</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be in some sense modular.</v>

308
00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:39.700
<v Speaker 1>Anything that can be abstracted and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>manipulated draws on exactly the same</v>

309
00:18:40.581 --> 00:18:43.190
<v Speaker 1>set of underlying skills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever those happen to be.</v>

310
00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:46.523
<v Speaker 2>Now</v>

311
00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:50.141
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

312
00:18:50.141 --> 00:18:52.480
<v Speaker 1>so what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is a perfectly reasonable thing to</v>

313
00:18:52.481 --> 00:18:54.130
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so what is.</v>

314
00:18:55.210 --> 00:19:00.210
<v Speaker 1>If you then take that rank quarter</v>
<v Speaker 1>and let's say you take the same thousand</v>

315
00:19:00.401 --> 00:19:03.980
<v Speaker 1>people 20 years later and you rank order</v>
<v Speaker 1>them in terms of how well they're doing</v>

316
00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:05.710
<v Speaker 1>their job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could just use income,</v>

317
00:19:05.711 --> 00:19:08.680
<v Speaker 1>say as a marker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's other markers you could use,</v>

318
00:19:08.681 --> 00:19:11.980
<v Speaker 1>but for the sake of simplicity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say income,</v>

319
00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:16.720
<v Speaker 1>the correlation between their original</v>
<v Speaker 1>rank order and the rank order of their</v>

320
00:19:16.721 --> 00:19:21.670
<v Speaker 1>performance will be something around if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had a full sample of intelligence,</v>

321
00:19:21.671 --> 00:19:24.940
<v Speaker 1>be something around point five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is</v>

322
00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:29.320
<v Speaker 1>point five is a staggeringly high</v>
<v Speaker 1>correlation,</v>

323
00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:33.190
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll hear that when you hear people</v>

324
00:19:33.191 --> 00:19:35.470
<v Speaker 1>talk about effect sizes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll hear them say that.</v>

325
00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:40.300
<v Speaker 1>Point two is a small effect size and</v>
<v Speaker 1>point three is a medium effect.</v>

326
00:19:40.301 --> 00:19:42.020
<v Speaker 1>Size and point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>

327
00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:46.270
<v Speaker 1>point point five is a medium effect size</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so forth.</v>

328
00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:50.560
<v Speaker 1>What you find out if you look at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>literature empirically is that point</v>

329
00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:53.080
<v Speaker 1>effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Size is a point five correlations of</v>

330
00:19:53.081 --> 00:19:56.470
<v Speaker 1>point five are vanishingly rare in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>social sciences.</v>

331
00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:01.800
<v Speaker 1>If you ever do a study with a reasonable</v>
<v Speaker 1>number of people with a novel measure</v>

332
00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:05.710
<v Speaker 1>and you're predicting something with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you get a correlation of point five,</v>

333
00:20:05.711 --> 00:20:07.960
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're jumping around the room because</v>

334
00:20:07.961 --> 00:20:10.420
<v Speaker 1>that's only gonna happen like once in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life,</v>

335
00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:13.780
<v Speaker 1>unless you're measuring something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who has already measured and you</v>

336
00:20:13.781 --> 00:20:16.390
<v Speaker 1>just don't know it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's,</v>

337
00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:17.590
<v Speaker 1>it's fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

338
00:20:17.591 --> 00:20:22.591
<v Speaker 1>it's a reasonable to point out that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>correlation between Icu say and academic</v>

339
00:20:22.871 --> 00:20:27.130
<v Speaker 1>performance or the correlation between</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iq and longterm career success,</v>

340
00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:31.420
<v Speaker 1>the size of that correlation is bigger</v>
<v Speaker 1>than the correlation between virtually</v>

341
00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:32.830
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

342
00:20:32.831 --> 00:20:35.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>virtually any other things that social</v>

343
00:20:35.081 --> 00:20:39.760
<v Speaker 1>scientists have ever discovered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the thing about it too is it's very</v>

344
00:20:39.761 --> 00:20:40.594
<v Speaker 1>straightforward.</v>

345
00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:42.760
<v Speaker 1>You know what the procedure that I just</v>
<v Speaker 1>told you,</v>

346
00:20:42.761 --> 00:20:44.920
<v Speaker 1>anyone can replicate that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

347
00:20:44.921 --> 00:20:48.100
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to come up with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>universal library of obviously,</v>

348
00:20:48.101 --> 00:20:50.950
<v Speaker 1>but you can use the internet as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable proxy.</v>

349
00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:56.670
<v Speaker 1>So not only is Iq easy to understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a measurement perspective,</v>

350
00:20:57.671 --> 00:21:00.430
<v Speaker 1>it's also the tests are very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very easy to replicate in.</v>

351
00:21:00.431 --> 00:21:05.431
<v Speaker 1>They're extremely powerful predictors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it turns out actually that Iq is</v>

352
00:21:06.611 --> 00:21:11.611
<v Speaker 1>correlated more strongly with how</v>
<v Speaker 1>rapidly you learn a task than it is with</v>

353
00:21:12.161 --> 00:21:15.640
<v Speaker 1>your performance per se,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the correlation between rate of</v>

354
00:21:15.641 --> 00:21:20.200
<v Speaker 1>learning of something novel and Iq can</v>
<v Speaker 1>be as high as six or point seven,</v>

355
00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:23.380
<v Speaker 1>which you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other bit of that would probably be</v>

356
00:21:23.381 --> 00:21:27.400
<v Speaker 1>taken up by something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness or openness or</v>

357
00:21:27.401 --> 00:21:31.600
<v Speaker 1>negatively with emotional stability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're picking up a tremendous amount</v>

358
00:21:31.601 --> 00:21:35.800
<v Speaker 1>of the variation between in people's</v>
<v Speaker 1>performances with that single measure</v>

359
00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:39.460
<v Speaker 1>and you can derive a pretty decent</v>
<v Speaker 1>indicator of Iq in 20 minutes,</v>

360
00:21:39.461 --> 00:21:42.340
<v Speaker 1>which is also pretty frightening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

361
00:21:42.341 --> 00:21:45.100
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>

362
00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:48.070
<v Speaker 1>So that's our cute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does anybody have any questions about</v>

363
00:21:48.071 --> 00:21:49.840
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

364
00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:02.400
<v Speaker 1>Well you have to formulate them in</v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

365
00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:05.223
<v Speaker 2>That's all.</v>

366
00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:14.220
<v Speaker 1>Now a lot of people have complained</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the idea of intelligence because</v>

367
00:22:14.221 --> 00:22:17.640
<v Speaker 1>they don't like the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't really mind the idea so much</v>

368
00:22:17.641 --> 00:22:21.750
<v Speaker 1>that there are smart people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people really don't like the idea</v>

369
00:22:21.751 --> 00:22:24.300
<v Speaker 1>that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are dumb people and you know,</v>

370
00:22:24.301 --> 00:22:24.810
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

371
00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:27.390
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really not reasonable from a</v>

372
00:22:27.391 --> 00:22:29.820
<v Speaker 1>logical perspective to have one without</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other.</v>

373
00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:35.150
<v Speaker 1>And it's easy to see why people object</v>
<v Speaker 1>to that because whatever term you use to</v>

374
00:22:36.001 --> 00:22:41.001
<v Speaker 1>refer to the low end of the intelligence</v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution rapidly takes on a</v>

375
00:22:41.071 --> 00:22:45.770
<v Speaker 1>pejorative nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So and so what happens is the culture</v>

376
00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:48.690
<v Speaker 1>cycle through various words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>decade by decade,</v>

377
00:22:48.691 --> 00:22:52.830
<v Speaker 1>trying to describe the lower end of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence distribution,</v>

378
00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:55.170
<v Speaker 1>but all the words ended up being</v>
<v Speaker 1>pejorative.</v>

379
00:22:55.171 --> 00:22:58.110
<v Speaker 1>And so they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're changed decade after decade.</v>

380
00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:04.450
<v Speaker 1>But you and you can understand that</v>
<v Speaker 1>because first of all,</v>

381
00:23:04.451 --> 00:23:09.010
<v Speaker 1>there's great danger in labeling someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>unintelligent perhaps period.</v>

382
00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:11.530
<v Speaker 1>But certainly if there's measurement</v>
<v Speaker 1>error,</v>

383
00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:13.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you're labeled on intelligent,</v>

384
00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:15.430
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're not,</v>

385
00:23:15.431 --> 00:23:19.390
<v Speaker 1>that's going to be real catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's measurement error problems,</v>

386
00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:25.830
<v Speaker 1>but then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to think about the problems of</v>

387
00:23:25.831 --> 00:23:27.630
<v Speaker 1>not doing the measurement.</v>

388
00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:32.690
<v Speaker 1>So this is something I've thought about</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a long time.</v>

389
00:23:32.691 --> 00:23:33.524
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

390
00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:40.630
<v Speaker 1>let's say that I assessed your verbal Iq</v>
<v Speaker 1>before you came to the University of</v>

391
00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:44.930
<v Speaker 1>Toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forget linguistic differences as soon we</v>

392
00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:47.720
<v Speaker 1>control for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is very difficult at the</v>

393
00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:50.090
<v Speaker 1>University of Toronto because there's so</v>
<v Speaker 1>many people who have English as a second</v>

394
00:23:50.091 --> 00:23:51.920
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But forget about that for a minute.</v>

395
00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:56.150
<v Speaker 1>Let's say I got a entire population</v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution,</v>

396
00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:59.240
<v Speaker 1>not only of the applicants from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>University of Toronto but over the</v>

397
00:23:59.241 --> 00:24:03.230
<v Speaker 1>entire population,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I said categorically that the bottom</v>

398
00:24:03.231 --> 00:24:07.250
<v Speaker 1>30 percent of the people in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution would not be able to</v>

399
00:24:07.251 --> 00:24:12.251
<v Speaker 1>graduate from the University of Toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I doing them a favor by not letting</v>

400
00:24:12.591 --> 00:24:17.591
<v Speaker 1>them apply or am I harming them</v>
<v Speaker 1>while we know perfectly well?</v>

401
00:24:18.591 --> 00:24:23.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean the probability that there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody in this room that has an Iq of</v>

402
00:24:23.301 --> 00:24:26.570
<v Speaker 1>less than 115 is pretty damn low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if,</v>

403
00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:31.130
<v Speaker 1>if there is someone in the room who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>general intelligence level is at that</v>

404
00:24:31.131 --> 00:24:33.200
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can bloody well be sure they're</v>

405
00:24:33.201 --> 00:24:35.750
<v Speaker 1>working like mad dogs in order to keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

406
00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:39.530
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not saying that all of you who</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to work like mad dogs to keep up,</v>

407
00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:40.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

408
00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:45.020
<v Speaker 1>are necessarily a lower than you might</v>
<v Speaker 1>be an ICU.</v>

409
00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:49.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying that because Iq and part</v>
<v Speaker 1>seems to be a measure of something like</v>

410
00:24:49.911 --> 00:24:53.270
<v Speaker 1>processing speed or rate of</v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding or something like that.</v>

411
00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:58.310
<v Speaker 1>If you're not in the upper echelons of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the distribution and you're tasked with</v>

412
00:24:58.311 --> 00:25:01.940
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily difficult tasks that</v>
<v Speaker 1>require abstraction and quick learning,</v>

413
00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:06.650
<v Speaker 1>the only way that you can compensate for</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is by working to an incredible degree</v>

414
00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:10.520
<v Speaker 1>and you can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's also why at the University of</v>

415
00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:12.020
<v Speaker 1>Toronto,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know this perfectly well and it's</v>

416
00:25:12.021 --> 00:25:14.570
<v Speaker 1>true in other educational institutions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

417
00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:19.780
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness is almost as good a</v>
<v Speaker 1>predictor of grades as intelligence and</v>

418
00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:23.030
<v Speaker 1>that only makes sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like who the hell is going to get</v>

419
00:25:23.031 --> 00:25:23.864
<v Speaker 1>the good grades?</v>

420
00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:26.330
<v Speaker 1>The smart people who work hard and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean,</v>

421
00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:29.420
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't be good if that wasn't the</v>
<v Speaker 1>case as far as I can tell,</v>

422
00:25:29.421 --> 00:25:34.421
<v Speaker 1>because hopefully what you get when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>get a great is an indicator of how fast</v>

423
00:25:34.641 --> 00:25:35.690
<v Speaker 1>you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how well you know,</v>

424
00:25:35.691 --> 00:25:38.570
<v Speaker 1>the material and how much effort you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>put into learning it.</v>

425
00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:42.140
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The relationship between creativity and</v>

426
00:25:42.141 --> 00:25:44.000
<v Speaker 1>grades at the University of Toronto is</v>
<v Speaker 1>zero,</v>

427
00:25:44.001 --> 00:25:45.950
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you control for Iq,</v>

428
00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:47.400
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

429
00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:50.350
<v Speaker 1>perhaps rather appalling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is,</v>

430
00:25:50.351 --> 00:25:52.850
<v Speaker 1>is that it's very difficult to assess</v>
<v Speaker 1>creative people,</v>

431
00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:54.770
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they're annoying,</v>

432
00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:59.360
<v Speaker 1>creative people do things in a new way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the problem with trying to assess</v>

433
00:25:59.361 --> 00:26:02.990
<v Speaker 1>whether or not someone has done saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>something in a new way is that you have</v>

434
00:26:02.991 --> 00:26:07.190
<v Speaker 1>to come up with a new scheme of grading</v>
<v Speaker 1>for that and you can believe that's not</v>

435
00:26:07.191 --> 00:26:08.390
<v Speaker 1>going to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

436
00:26:08.391 --> 00:26:11.540
<v Speaker 1>and then it's worse because if you're a</v>
<v Speaker 1>creative person and you're graded by</v>

437
00:26:11.541 --> 00:26:13.850
<v Speaker 1>someone who isn't creative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to think you're</v>

438
00:26:13.851 --> 00:26:15.500
<v Speaker 1>creative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just gonna think that you're</v>

439
00:26:15.501 --> 00:26:16.334
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

440
00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:17.900
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you might be,</v>

441
00:26:17.901 --> 00:26:19.760
<v Speaker 1>because lots of times if you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>creative,</v>

442
00:26:19.761 --> 00:26:23.060
<v Speaker 1>you're also wrong because it's not that</v>
<v Speaker 1>easy to come up with a novel way of</v>

443
00:26:23.061 --> 00:26:26.330
<v Speaker 1>doing something or a novel hypothesis</v>
<v Speaker 1>that actually is going to be an</v>

444
00:26:26.331 --> 00:26:28.820
<v Speaker 1>improvement over the previous</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis.</v>

445
00:26:28.821 --> 00:26:31.880
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time you're off on a tangent</v>

446
00:26:31.881 --> 00:26:34.400
<v Speaker 1>and it's an incorrect tangent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

447
00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:39.860
<v Speaker 1>various people have criticized the idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a single intelligence and so they've</v>

448
00:26:39.861 --> 00:26:42.260
<v Speaker 1>made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I guess the most famous ones</v>

449
00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:47.380
<v Speaker 1>probably in last 15 years or 20 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>have been Robert Sternberg and,</v>

450
00:26:48.091 --> 00:26:50.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Martin Gardner.</v>

451
00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:55.170
<v Speaker 1>Martin Gardner is not a scientist by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way at all.</v>

452
00:26:55.550 --> 00:26:59.010
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he claims directly that he doesn't</v>

453
00:26:59.011 --> 00:27:01.620
<v Speaker 1>really care if his intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his can be measured.</v>

454
00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:04.830
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not that helpful because if</v>

455
00:27:04.831 --> 00:27:07.920
<v Speaker 1>you're working as a scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if what you're talking about can't be</v>

456
00:27:07.921 --> 00:27:10.260
<v Speaker 1>measured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it doesn't exist and you can even</v>

457
00:27:10.261 --> 00:27:11.670
<v Speaker 1>make a philosophical case.</v>

458
00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:15.030
<v Speaker 1>I think that if what you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about can't be measured in any possible</v>

459
00:27:15.031 --> 00:27:17.430
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's no sense in assuming that</v>

460
00:27:17.431 --> 00:27:20.080
<v Speaker 1>it exists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now Gardener is posited,</v>

461
00:27:20.530 --> 00:27:23.250
<v Speaker 1>intelligence is like linguistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>musical,</v>

462
00:27:23.251 --> 00:27:24.540
<v Speaker 1>logical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mathematical,</v>

463
00:27:24.541 --> 00:27:26.280
<v Speaker 1>spacial body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kinesthetic,</v>

464
00:27:26.281 --> 00:27:29.240
<v Speaker 1>interpersonal and interpersonal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

465
00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:33.690
<v Speaker 1>one thing you might note is that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>already have a perfectly good word for</v>

466
00:27:33.691 --> 00:27:37.410
<v Speaker 1>all of those performance variability</v>
<v Speaker 1>across all those domains in so far as it</v>

467
00:27:37.411 --> 00:27:39.810
<v Speaker 1>actually exists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that would be talent.</v>

468
00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:43.710
<v Speaker 1>So there's no reason to confuse the word</v>
<v Speaker 1>talent with the word intelligence.</v>

469
00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:47.250
<v Speaker 1>And the next thing that you might know</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that a lot of these so called</v>

470
00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:52.360
<v Speaker 1>intelligences are likely captured not so</v>
<v Speaker 1>much by intelligence but by variability</v>

471
00:27:52.531 --> 00:27:55.230
<v Speaker 1>in personality traits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we already understand.</v>

472
00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:58.920
<v Speaker 1>And so to throw a bunch of new terms in</v>
<v Speaker 1>like linguistic,</v>

473
00:27:58.921 --> 00:27:59.820
<v Speaker 1>musical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>logical,</v>

474
00:27:59.821 --> 00:28:01.380
<v Speaker 1>mathematical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spacial body,</v>

475
00:28:01.381 --> 00:28:03.720
<v Speaker 1>kinesthetic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interpersonal and intrapersonal.</v>

476
00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:06.470
<v Speaker 1>All that does is muddy that conceptual</v>
<v Speaker 1>waters,</v>

477
00:28:06.610 --> 00:28:07.443
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it adds.</v>

478
00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:10.560
<v Speaker 1>Now there's a reason for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason is fundamentally</v>

479
00:28:10.561 --> 00:28:12.690
<v Speaker 1>political and the political reason is is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that</v>

480
00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:19.440
<v Speaker 1>it is uncomfortable for people to admit</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there might be something like</v>

481
00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:24.000
<v Speaker 1>actual differences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inability that are important and under</v>

482
00:28:24.001 --> 00:28:28.380
<v Speaker 1>radical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I can understand why people would</v>

483
00:28:28.381 --> 00:28:32.790
<v Speaker 1>have trouble with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but consider the alternatives.</v>

484
00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:40.790
<v Speaker 1>We know part of the reason that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>here and we'll perhaps stay here and</v>

485
00:28:40.801 --> 00:28:44.910
<v Speaker 1>will perhaps be successful in so far as</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can define success along the</v>

486
00:28:44.911 --> 00:28:49.380
<v Speaker 1>dimension of career attainment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say in your life as it unfolds from this</v>

487
00:28:49.381 --> 00:28:52.320
<v Speaker 1>time onward is because you work hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

488
00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:55.550
<v Speaker 1>But we also know that part of the reason</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're here is because you're</v>

489
00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:58.170
<v Speaker 1>smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the question is,</v>

490
00:28:58.171 --> 00:29:00.750
<v Speaker 1>what should you do with that from an</v>
<v Speaker 1>ethical perspective?</v>

491
00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:02.910
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should you say,</v>

492
00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:05.340
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm no smarter than anyone else,</v>

493
00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:09.330
<v Speaker 1>which means that maybe you're much more</v>
<v Speaker 1>hardworking than everyone else,</v>

494
00:29:09.331 --> 00:29:10.640
<v Speaker 1>so you're still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

495
00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:13.590
<v Speaker 1>denigrating the non achieving end of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution.</v>

496
00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:19.470
<v Speaker 1>Or do you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been blessed by something that's</v>

497
00:29:19.471 --> 00:29:23.700
<v Speaker 1>actually beyond my control and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>privileged as a consequence of that,</v>

498
00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:28.260
<v Speaker 1>and then decide what exactly that means</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of your responsibility.</v>

499
00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:31.560
<v Speaker 1>Those are your choices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

500
00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:36.740
<v Speaker 1>but to not take into account the fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you've been blessed at at least one</v>

501
00:29:37.711 --> 00:29:41.040
<v Speaker 1>level of analysis with a favorable roll</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the die,</v>

502
00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:46.100
<v Speaker 1>after the randomness dice seems to me</v>
<v Speaker 1>they completely misstate the nature of</v>

503
00:29:47.021 --> 00:29:51.790
<v Speaker 1>the causal sequences that propel you</v>
<v Speaker 1>into what's essentially a position of</v>

504
00:29:51.791 --> 00:29:53.590
<v Speaker 1>privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

505
00:29:53.591 --> 00:29:57.520
<v Speaker 1>but that by denying the differences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the innate differences in people with</v>

506
00:29:57.521 --> 00:30:02.410
<v Speaker 1>regards to important abilities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all you do is attribute all your success</v>

507
00:30:02.411 --> 00:30:07.411
<v Speaker 1>to your own particular individual</v>
<v Speaker 1>controllable actions.</v>

508
00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:13.180
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that you don't deserve</v>

509
00:30:13.181 --> 00:30:15.670
<v Speaker 1>credit for your work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like more power to you and all of</v>

510
00:30:15.671 --> 00:30:16.504
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

511
00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:21.370
<v Speaker 1>the idea that some people are smarter</v>
<v Speaker 1>than others,</v>

512
00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:25.120
<v Speaker 1>that's not an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a fact.</v>

513
00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:28.720
<v Speaker 1>And it's an uncomfortable fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that we won't deal with it</v>

514
00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:33.960
<v Speaker 1>means that people suffer unnecessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's go back to those people in the</v>

515
00:30:35.531 --> 00:30:37.720
<v Speaker 1>distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say the bottom 30 percent of the</v>

516
00:30:37.721 --> 00:30:41.830
<v Speaker 1>distribution isn't going to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get a degree at the University of</v>

517
00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:42.810
<v Speaker 1>Toronto,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

518
00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:47.920
<v Speaker 1>unless they are capable of working to an</v>
<v Speaker 1>insane level and even than likely not.</v>

519
00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:49.453
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

520
00:30:52.110 --> 00:30:56.010
<v Speaker 1>so let's say that you have a ability</v>
<v Speaker 1>blind admission process.</v>

521
00:30:56.400 --> 00:31:00.020
<v Speaker 1>It's random.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So everybody's name,</v>

522
00:31:00.021 --> 00:31:02.940
<v Speaker 1>ms dot thrown into a hat and if they get</v>
<v Speaker 1>pulled out,</v>

523
00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:07.970
<v Speaker 1>they get to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think that you're doing the people</v>

524
00:31:08.291 --> 00:31:09.700
<v Speaker 1>who are going to fail a service</v>

525
00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:11.463
<v Speaker 2>or not,</v>

526
00:31:12.610 --> 00:31:14.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now you could make a case that you</v>

527
00:31:14.141 --> 00:31:19.141
<v Speaker 1>are because it's likely that they'll be</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of individuals in the bottom</v>

528
00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:23.680
<v Speaker 1>part of the distribution who will make</v>
<v Speaker 1>it through partly because of measurement</v>

529
00:31:23.681 --> 00:31:24.371
<v Speaker 1>error,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

530
00:31:24.371 --> 00:31:27.580
<v Speaker 1>Because you're not going to measure this</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfectly and partly because,</v>

531
00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:30.220
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are surprising and amazing</v>

532
00:31:30.221 --> 00:31:33.730
<v Speaker 1>creatures and you never know exactly</v>
<v Speaker 1>what any given one of them is going to</v>

533
00:31:33.731 --> 00:31:35.800
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to torture a lot of</v>

534
00:31:35.801 --> 00:31:37.540
<v Speaker 1>them to death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the same time.</v>

535
00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:40.900
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been struggling with this because</v>

536
00:31:40.901 --> 00:31:43.180
<v Speaker 1>I've developed tests that help</v>
<v Speaker 1>employees.</v>

537
00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:48.240
<v Speaker 1>Employers decide who might be competent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more competent than who,</v>

538
00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:52.330
<v Speaker 1>when they're hiring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's partly dependent on general</v>

539
00:31:52.331 --> 00:31:56.530
<v Speaker 1>cognitive ability and we think based on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the statistics,</v>

540
00:31:56.710 --> 00:32:00.040
<v Speaker 1>the relevant statistics that we can</v>
<v Speaker 1>improve the probability that a given</v>

541
00:32:00.041 --> 00:32:05.041
<v Speaker 1>employee employer will hire an above</v>
<v Speaker 1>average worker in a cognitively complex,</v>

542
00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:10.390
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a cognitively complex job position</v>

543
00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:14.800
<v Speaker 1>from 50 slash 50 to 75 slash 25 or 80</v>
<v Speaker 1>slash 20.</v>

544
00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:16.750
<v Speaker 1>It's quite a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>

545
00:32:16.751 --> 00:32:20.470
<v Speaker 1>Obviously there's still a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's still a fair margin of error</v>

546
00:32:20.471 --> 00:32:21.850
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

547
00:32:21.851 --> 00:32:25.600
<v Speaker 1>having half as many employees below</v>
<v Speaker 1>average is definitely going to be of</v>

548
00:32:25.601 --> 00:32:29.590
<v Speaker 1>tremendous benefit to your company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>

549
00:32:29.591 --> 00:32:33.730
<v Speaker 1>well that's unfair because there's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be measurement error too.</v>

550
00:32:34.090 --> 00:32:34.923
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

551
00:32:36.090 --> 00:32:37.840
<v Speaker 1>that's not the question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>

552
00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:40.760
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is more unfair than to do it any</v>

553
00:32:40.761 --> 00:32:42.540
<v Speaker 1>other way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

554
00:32:42.541 --> 00:32:44.690
<v Speaker 1>you could use interviews,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but tall,</v>

555
00:32:44.691 --> 00:32:47.210
<v Speaker 1>good looking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Extroverted people tend to do much</v>

556
00:32:47.211 --> 00:32:49.550
<v Speaker 1>better on interviews than short,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ugly,</v>

557
00:32:49.551 --> 00:32:52.070
<v Speaker 1>introverted people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're a little bit on</v>

558
00:32:52.071 --> 00:32:55.220
<v Speaker 1>the disagreeable side as well because</v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeable people also do better in</v>

559
00:32:55.221 --> 00:32:58.790
<v Speaker 1>interviews.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So not only are they tremendously biased</v>

560
00:32:58.791 --> 00:33:01.730
<v Speaker 1>in all of those dimensions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they actually don't predict performance</v>

561
00:33:01.731 --> 00:33:05.600
<v Speaker 1>in the long run very well at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So actually that means in the states</v>

562
00:33:05.601 --> 00:33:06.920
<v Speaker 1>they are illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

563
00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:10.010
<v Speaker 1>although companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lawyers haven't woken up to this fact</v>

564
00:33:10.011 --> 00:33:12.830
<v Speaker 1>yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're mandated by law in the United</v>

565
00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:16.700
<v Speaker 1>States to use the most accurate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>valid and reliable current means of</v>

566
00:33:16.701 --> 00:33:21.200
<v Speaker 1>hiring available and interviews are not</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and neither are letters of</v>

567
00:33:21.201 --> 00:33:23.270
<v Speaker 1>recommendation which are pretty much as</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad.</v>

568
00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:26.270
<v Speaker 1>They're not so much bias that letters of</v>
<v Speaker 1>recommendation,</v>

569
00:33:26.271 --> 00:33:30.860
<v Speaker 1>they're just useless because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except in so far as if you can't get</v>

570
00:33:30.861 --> 00:33:33.740
<v Speaker 1>anyone to write you a letter of</v>
<v Speaker 1>recommendation at all,</v>

571
00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:36.710
<v Speaker 1>well maybe that's an indication that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're very,</v>

572
00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:39.650
<v Speaker 1>you're not very socially skilled or that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have a very good social</v>

573
00:33:39.651 --> 00:33:40.700
<v Speaker 1>network or whatever.</v>

574
00:33:40.910 --> 00:33:45.050
<v Speaker 1>So maybe as a really blunt indicator of</v>
<v Speaker 1>isolation,</v>

575
00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:48.560
<v Speaker 1>you could derive some information out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>letters of recommendation.</v>

576
00:33:48.561 --> 00:33:51.740
<v Speaker 1>But as far as valid indicators of future</v>
<v Speaker 1>performance,</v>

577
00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:55.040
<v Speaker 1>they're just not valid at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's partly why I hate writing them.</v>

578
00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:56.430
<v Speaker 1>It's they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

579
00:33:56.740 --> 00:33:58.850
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're also illegal.</v>

580
00:33:58.851 --> 00:34:01.940
<v Speaker 1>At least they are in the us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though people don't understand that</v>

581
00:34:01.941 --> 00:34:03.830
<v Speaker 1>yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know the law and I know the</v>

582
00:34:03.831 --> 00:34:05.240
<v Speaker 1>validity statistics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

583
00:34:05.770 --> 00:34:08.120
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what you're required to do.</v>

584
00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:12.050
<v Speaker 1>So then you might also ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

585
00:34:12.140 --> 00:34:16.490
<v Speaker 1>so the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the other selection methods are also</v>

586
00:34:16.491 --> 00:34:18.980
<v Speaker 1>biased and unreliable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could say,</v>

587
00:34:18.981 --> 00:34:20.510
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could hire someone based on their</v>

588
00:34:20.511 --> 00:34:23.330
<v Speaker 1>academic history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but roughly that's an index of</v>

589
00:34:23.331 --> 00:34:25.430
<v Speaker 1>intelligence and conscientiousness</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>

590
00:34:25.431 --> 00:34:28.640
<v Speaker 1>it's just not a very good one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially because there's tremendous</v>

591
00:34:28.641 --> 00:34:32.200
<v Speaker 1>variability between schools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you have a,</v>

592
00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:35.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a GPA of four point zero from school x</v>

593
00:34:35.031 --> 00:34:38.210
<v Speaker 1>and this person has a gpa of four point</v>
<v Speaker 1>zero from school.</v>

594
00:34:38.211 --> 00:34:40.370
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no reason at all to assume that</v>

595
00:34:40.371 --> 00:34:43.490
<v Speaker 1>those are comparable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can use grades,</v>

596
00:34:43.491 --> 00:34:46.400
<v Speaker 1>but that's full of measurement error.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's not very good either.</v>

597
00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:51.880
<v Speaker 1>So you could guess that it'll give you a</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 slash 50 in terms of your probability</v>

598
00:34:54.711 --> 00:34:57.800
<v Speaker 1>of hiring someone who is above average</v>
<v Speaker 1>versus below average.</v>

599
00:34:58.160 --> 00:34:58.993
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

600
00:34:59.210 --> 00:35:02.270
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't seem to be a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent way of going about it either</v>

601
00:35:02.271 --> 00:35:02.900
<v Speaker 1>because.</v>

602
00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:04.670
<v Speaker 1>And here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's something to think about.</v>

603
00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:10.940
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's assume that there are 10 people</v>

604
00:35:10.941 --> 00:35:13.010
<v Speaker 1>working and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

605
00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:18.130
<v Speaker 1>inappropriate selection method places an</v>
<v Speaker 1>incompetent manager above them.</v>

606
00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:22.400
<v Speaker 1>So maybe the manager is less intelligent</v>
<v Speaker 1>than the workers.</v>

607
00:35:22.401 --> 00:35:27.401
<v Speaker 1>That might be one possibility or maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>the managers less creative than the</v>

608
00:35:27.651 --> 00:35:30.320
<v Speaker 1>workers are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the manager is less conscientious</v>

609
00:35:30.321 --> 00:35:32.090
<v Speaker 1>or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>

610
00:35:32.091 --> 00:35:36.710
<v Speaker 1>Some dimension of competence is not well</v>
<v Speaker 1>matched with the demands of the job.</v>

611
00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:40.860
<v Speaker 1>Well then one of the questions is what</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly are you doing to the manager</v>

612
00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:43.920
<v Speaker 1>while you're basically setting them up</v>
<v Speaker 1>to fail?</v>

613
00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:47.640
<v Speaker 1>And the tremendous number of managers</v>
<v Speaker 1>fail in the first two years of their,</v>

614
00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:49.060
<v Speaker 1>of their promotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

615
00:35:49.061 --> 00:35:53.430
<v Speaker 1>it's well above 50 percent and so that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not so good for them.</v>

616
00:35:53.431 --> 00:35:57.870
<v Speaker 1>But then you're also doing the 10 people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're supervising to a kind of</v>

617
00:35:57.871 --> 00:36:02.010
<v Speaker 1>horrible pr,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no perdition for the time it takes for</v>

618
00:36:02.011 --> 00:36:04.650
<v Speaker 1>everyone to calculate that the manager</v>
<v Speaker 1>is actually failing.</v>

619
00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:08.460
<v Speaker 1>And what that means generally is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the very highly qualified people in the</v>

620
00:36:08.461 --> 00:36:10.470
<v Speaker 1>work approval,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll just leave because why would they</v>

621
00:36:10.471 --> 00:36:12.720
<v Speaker 1>put up with that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you might think,</v>

622
00:36:12.721 --> 00:36:15.240
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it unethical to select properly or is</v>

623
00:36:15.241 --> 00:36:19.320
<v Speaker 1>it ethical to select randomly or exactly</v>
<v Speaker 1>how should you solve that problem?</v>

624
00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:21.180
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

625
00:36:21.181 --> 00:36:23.580
<v Speaker 1>we do try to solve it because we use</v>
<v Speaker 1>selection methods,</v>

626
00:36:23.581 --> 00:36:25.770
<v Speaker 1>but we usually use ones that aren't very</v>
<v Speaker 1>accurate.</v>

627
00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:30.480
<v Speaker 1>It's funny too because I tried selling</v>
<v Speaker 1>accurate selection tests to corporations</v>

628
00:36:30.481 --> 00:36:34.230
<v Speaker 1>for a very long period of time and one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the things I learned is they didn't</v>

629
00:36:34.231 --> 00:36:37.770
<v Speaker 1>want them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was mind boggling to me because the</v>

630
00:36:37.771 --> 00:36:41.460
<v Speaker 1>economic utility and hiring people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>are competent compared to people who</v>

631
00:36:41.461 --> 00:36:44.490
<v Speaker 1>aren't so high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's absolutely mind boggling because</v>

632
00:36:44.491 --> 00:36:47.730
<v Speaker 1>the difference in productivity between</v>
<v Speaker 1>people isn't even.</v>

633
00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:49.550
<v Speaker 1>It isn't normally distributed.</v>

634
00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:52.860
<v Speaker 1>It's Prieto distributed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people are staggeringly more</v>

635
00:36:52.861 --> 00:36:57.861
<v Speaker 1>productive than other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So tilting your selection criteria so</v>

636
00:36:58.051 --> 00:37:02.760
<v Speaker 1>that you pick from the more productive</v>
<v Speaker 1>end of the distribution means incredibly</v>

637
00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:05.580
<v Speaker 1>powerful economic benefits for your</v>
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>

638
00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:09.900
<v Speaker 1>But</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least when I was doing this to begin</v>

639
00:37:09.901 --> 00:37:12.330
<v Speaker 1>with human resources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are usually the ones</v>

640
00:37:12.331 --> 00:37:16.350
<v Speaker 1>evaluating the tests weren't necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most competent people in the</v>

641
00:37:16.351 --> 00:37:18.720
<v Speaker 1>corporate environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is something that hasn't changed</v>

642
00:37:18.721 --> 00:37:21.510
<v Speaker 1>very much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were very badly trained and they</v>

643
00:37:21.511 --> 00:37:24.150
<v Speaker 1>believed that there were no differences</v>
<v Speaker 1>between people that couldn't be</v>

644
00:37:24.151 --> 00:37:26.250
<v Speaker 1>eliminated with training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like,</v>

645
00:37:26.251 --> 00:37:27.150
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

646
00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:29.730
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's wrong as anybody,</v>

647
00:37:29.731 --> 00:37:33.210
<v Speaker 1>if you have any sense at all and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about it for 15 or 20 seconds,</v>

648
00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:34.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the case.</v>

649
00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:36.600
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it was like in your</v>

650
00:37:36.601 --> 00:37:38.100
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the school I went to,</v>

651
00:37:38.101 --> 00:37:41.550
<v Speaker 1>which was way the hell up in northern</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alberta in the middle of no man's land,</v>

652
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was at least 15 percent of the</v>

653
00:37:45.211 --> 00:37:47.640
<v Speaker 1>students,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say it was probably higher who</v>

654
00:37:47.641 --> 00:37:50.640
<v Speaker 1>are still functionally illiterate by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time they hit grade 10.</v>

655
00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:55.170
<v Speaker 1>Functional illiteracy being they had</v>
<v Speaker 1>never read an entire book.</v>

656
00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:57.810
<v Speaker 1>And that's way more common than you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>

657
00:37:57.990 --> 00:37:59.520
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how common you think that</v>

658
00:37:59.521 --> 00:38:02.480
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the stats basically indicate there's</v>

659
00:38:02.490 --> 00:38:07.490
<v Speaker 1>as many people with Iqs of 85 and lower</v>
<v Speaker 1>as there are people with Iqs of 115 and</v>

660
00:38:07.831 --> 00:38:09.600
<v Speaker 1>higher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

661
00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:14.250
<v Speaker 1>And I already said that the minimum Iq</v>
<v Speaker 1>level of anybody in this room is likely</v>

662
00:38:14.251 --> 00:38:19.251
<v Speaker 1>to be something around 115.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the person in this room who has the</v>

663
00:38:19.561 --> 00:38:23.490
<v Speaker 1>lowest general cognitive ability is</v>
<v Speaker 1>smarter than 85 percent of the general</v>

664
00:38:23.491 --> 00:38:28.470
<v Speaker 1>population at 85 and lower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is there's just as many people</v>

665
00:38:28.471 --> 00:38:33.471
<v Speaker 1>there as there is at 115 and higher at</v>
<v Speaker 1>85 and lower then you don't get</v>

666
00:38:33.481 --> 00:38:38.481
<v Speaker 1>literacy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people with Iqs of 90 or less have a</v>

667
00:38:38.931 --> 00:38:43.931
<v Speaker 1>difficult time translating written words</v>
<v Speaker 1>into action so they can't really read</v>

668
00:38:45.291 --> 00:38:47.300
<v Speaker 1>instructions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

669
00:38:47.301 --> 00:38:48.134
<v Speaker 1>And that's like</v>

670
00:38:50.050 --> 00:38:53.200
<v Speaker 1>10 percent of the population is 15</v>
<v Speaker 1>percent of the population,</v>

671
00:38:53.201 --> 00:38:56.650
<v Speaker 1>actually 15 percent of the population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's.</v>

672
00:38:56.651 --> 00:39:00.100
<v Speaker 1>So you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well no way.</v>

673
00:39:00.101 --> 00:39:02.500
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you don't get to have an opinion on</v>

674
00:39:02.501 --> 00:39:04.600
<v Speaker 1>this by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the science has already been</v>

675
00:39:04.601 --> 00:39:06.460
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I can tell you one fact that's</v>

676
00:39:06.461 --> 00:39:10.090
<v Speaker 1>pretty unsettling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the United States army has been doing</v>

677
00:39:10.091 --> 00:39:14.590
<v Speaker 1>Iq testing on its recruits for since</v>
<v Speaker 1>before World War One.</v>

678
00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:19.180
<v Speaker 1>They actually did a lot of the research</v>
<v Speaker 1>that established Iq tests and validated</v>

679
00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:21.100
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And indicated that they were reliable</v>

680
00:39:21.101 --> 00:39:23.320
<v Speaker 1>and so forth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that a variety of reasons for doing</v>

681
00:39:23.321 --> 00:39:24.350
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

682
00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:28.450
<v Speaker 1>partly I guess they didn't want to put</v>
<v Speaker 1>in competent people in charge of deadly</v>

683
00:39:28.451 --> 00:39:31.030
<v Speaker 1>machinery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which does seem to be a reasonable</v>

684
00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:32.410
<v Speaker 1>proposition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>

685
00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:36.430
<v Speaker 1>But what they found as a consequence of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their hundreds,</v>

686
00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:41.640
<v Speaker 1>100 years of testing was that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't teach anybody with an Iq of 83</v>

687
00:39:42.821 --> 00:39:47.821
<v Speaker 1>or lower anything at all that would make</v>
<v Speaker 1>them anything but an obstacle to the,</v>

688
00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:52.300
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tasks that the armed forces had to</v>

689
00:39:52.301 --> 00:39:55.540
<v Speaker 1>complete on a regular basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's 83.</v>

690
00:39:55.541 --> 00:39:58.930
<v Speaker 1>So now in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually illegal to induct anyone</v>

691
00:39:58.931 --> 00:40:01.630
<v Speaker 1>into the armed forces if they have an Iq</v>
<v Speaker 1>of 83 or lower.</v>

692
00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:04.480
<v Speaker 1>And that's more than 10 percent of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>

693
00:40:04.990 --> 00:40:09.990
<v Speaker 1>Now you got to think about that because</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it means is that approximately 10</v>

694
00:40:10.151 --> 00:40:13.330
<v Speaker 1>percent of the population is</v>
<v Speaker 1>sufficiently,</v>

695
00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:16.073
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

696
00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:21.230
<v Speaker 1>has sufficiently low general cognitive</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability that</v>

697
00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:23.800
<v Speaker 2>one of the</v>

698
00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:29.880
<v Speaker 1>complex enterprises that's chronically</v>
<v Speaker 1>most desperate for manpower has decided</v>

699
00:40:31.091 --> 00:40:36.091
<v Speaker 1>that there no point in even trying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's a dismal outcome.</v>

700
00:40:38.290 --> 00:40:41.140
<v Speaker 1>But I don't know exactly what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to do with that fact,</v>

701
00:40:41.141 --> 00:40:44.320
<v Speaker 1>but ignoring it doesn't seem to me to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right thing because it doesn't solve</v>

702
00:40:44.321 --> 00:40:48.130
<v Speaker 1>the problem and this is going to become</v>
<v Speaker 1>an increasingly and increasingly</v>

703
00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:54.630
<v Speaker 1>present and and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and unavoidable and ignorable problem.</v>

704
00:40:56.710 --> 00:41:00.460
<v Speaker 1>Because you know already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what's happening in developed</v>

705
00:41:00.461 --> 00:41:02.680
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Less so in underdeveloped countries,</v>

706
00:41:03.010 --> 00:41:06.940
<v Speaker 1>but in developed countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gap between the rich and the poor is</v>

707
00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:09.350
<v Speaker 1>increasing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for,</v>

708
00:41:09.370 --> 00:41:13.600
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost all of the increases in wealth</v>

709
00:41:13.930 --> 00:41:17.470
<v Speaker 1>that have accrued to people in the last</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 years have accrued to people who are</v>

710
00:41:17.471 --> 00:41:20.050
<v Speaker 1>in the top one percent of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution of wealth.</v>

711
00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:25.030
<v Speaker 1>And that's not going to stop by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of the reason is,</v>

712
00:41:25.031 --> 00:41:29.920
<v Speaker 1>is that cognitive power has become even</v>
<v Speaker 1>more valuable than it was four years</v>

713
00:41:29.921 --> 00:41:30.160
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>

714
00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:33.070
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is computers</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically.</v>

715
00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:36.710
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're really smart and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're good with a computer,</v>

716
00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:40.370
<v Speaker 1>you're way ahead of someone who isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>very smart and who doesn't know how to</v>

717
00:41:40.371 --> 00:41:43.430
<v Speaker 1>use computers at all and you're not just</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit ahead.</v>

718
00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:46.850
<v Speaker 1>You're leaps and bounds ahead and worse</v>
<v Speaker 1>than that,</v>

719
00:41:46.851 --> 00:41:49.910
<v Speaker 1>you're getting farther ahead all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time and the reason for that is that</v>

720
00:41:49.911 --> 00:41:53.330
<v Speaker 1>computational power keeps increasing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it increases a lot.</v>

721
00:41:53.331 --> 00:41:58.310
<v Speaker 1>It's doubling about every 18 months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so part of the problem that the human</v>

722
00:41:58.311 --> 00:42:02.540
<v Speaker 1>race is going to have to face in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>next 30 years along with many other</v>

723
00:42:02.541 --> 00:42:07.280
<v Speaker 1>problems is what are you going to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>with people who have neither the</v>

724
00:42:07.281 --> 00:42:12.020
<v Speaker 1>cognitive ability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nor the conscientiousness to find a</v>

725
00:42:12.021 --> 00:42:17.021
<v Speaker 1>niche in society that's actually that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that other people will value enough to</v>

726
00:42:18.341 --> 00:42:20.500
<v Speaker 1>pay for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that's really the question.</v>

727
00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:22.570
<v Speaker 1>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

728
00:42:22.571 --> 00:42:25.300
<v Speaker 1>the conservative answer to that as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a job for everyone.</v>

729
00:42:25.301 --> 00:42:26.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

730
00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:28.510
<v Speaker 1>that's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There isn't.</v>

731
00:42:28.750 --> 00:42:31.030
<v Speaker 1>And the liberal answer is well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's the same,</v>

732
00:42:31.031 --> 00:42:33.760
<v Speaker 1>so it's just a matter of training and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's also wrong.</v>

733
00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:36.700
<v Speaker 1>They're both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both of those positions are there.</v>

734
00:42:37.070 --> 00:42:40.090
<v Speaker 1>The scientific research has rented them</v>
<v Speaker 1>permanently outdated.</v>

735
00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:49.280
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

736
00:42:49.310 --> 00:42:52.910
<v Speaker 1>there is the possibility of providing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>minimum income.</v>

737
00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:54.793
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

738
00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:58.580
<v Speaker 1>the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what will that do is completely</v>

739
00:42:58.581 --> 00:43:00.860
<v Speaker 1>unanswerable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have no idea what it'll do.</v>

740
00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:04.370
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might start people from,</v>

741
00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:05.940
<v Speaker 1>from starving to death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although the,</v>

742
00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:09.350
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say in North America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's generally not a problem people</v>

743
00:43:09.351 --> 00:43:13.250
<v Speaker 1>have anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we don't know.</v>

744
00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:14.170
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think of,</v>

745
00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:17.480
<v Speaker 1>I think of human beings as pack animals</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally.</v>

746
00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:19.070
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on I and I,</v>

747
00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:19.973
<v Speaker 1>this is just,</v>

748
00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:25.050
<v Speaker 1>it's a metaphor in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that people can be happy</v>

749
00:43:25.051 --> 00:43:27.390
<v Speaker 1>and less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are burdened down with something</v>

750
00:43:27.391 --> 00:43:30.450
<v Speaker 1>like a sled dog is burdened down with</v>
<v Speaker 1>something you know,</v>

751
00:43:30.451 --> 00:43:33.170
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to have a responsibilities,</v>

752
00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:35.250
<v Speaker 1>they have to be important</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibilities.</v>

753
00:43:35.610 --> 00:43:38.520
<v Speaker 1>You have to be sequenced in your time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

754
00:43:38.521 --> 00:43:40.980
<v Speaker 1>most of the people I have in my clinical</v>
<v Speaker 1>practice,</v>

755
00:43:40.981 --> 00:43:43.800
<v Speaker 1>if they're not employed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just fall apart and the</v>

756
00:43:43.801 --> 00:43:47.710
<v Speaker 1>conscientious ones fall apart because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they eat themselves up with shame and</v>

757
00:43:48.390 --> 00:43:52.830
<v Speaker 1>guilt and the unconscientious ones fall</v>
<v Speaker 1>apart because their sleep schedule goes</v>

758
00:43:52.831 --> 00:43:54.810
<v Speaker 1>all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't eat regularly,</v>

759
00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:58.080
<v Speaker 1>regularly anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do all sorts of impulsive things</v>

760
00:43:58.081 --> 00:44:02.820
<v Speaker 1>that are counterproductive and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just sort of spiral into a pool of</v>

761
00:44:02.821 --> 00:44:07.320
<v Speaker 1>meaninglessness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So human beings are pretty social and</v>

762
00:44:07.321 --> 00:44:09.000
<v Speaker 1>we're pretty altruistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

763
00:44:09.001 --> 00:44:10.500
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some weird manner,</v>

764
00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:12.870
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't seem to me that people can</v>

765
00:44:12.871 --> 00:44:14.010
<v Speaker 1>live a life that's</v>

766
00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:20.840
<v Speaker 1>acceptable if all they have is enforced</v>
<v Speaker 1>leisure.</v>

767
00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:25.970
<v Speaker 1>So maybe that'll be wrong if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>provided people with a base salary,</v>

768
00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:29.240
<v Speaker 1>maybe people would figure out what to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>with their spare time.</v>

769
00:44:29.241 --> 00:44:30.280
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

770
00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:35.520
<v Speaker 1>I doubt it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think people are.</v>

771
00:44:35.970 --> 00:44:38.640
<v Speaker 1>I think it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very difficult for people to regulate</v>

772
00:44:38.641 --> 00:44:41.460
<v Speaker 1>themselves in the absence of a certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>minimum of,</v>

773
00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:44.940
<v Speaker 1>of social structuring and guidance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen very,</v>

774
00:44:44.941 --> 00:44:49.941
<v Speaker 1>very few people who can conjure that up</v>
<v Speaker 1>on their own and manage it for extensive</v>

775
00:44:51.271 --> 00:44:53.490
<v Speaker 1>periods of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I've only met one person,</v>

776
00:44:53.491 --> 00:44:55.920
<v Speaker 1>I would say in my whole life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's actually managed that.</v>

777
00:44:56.490 --> 00:45:01.490
<v Speaker 1>And that particular person has a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>large array of talents and is extremely</v>

778
00:45:01.921 --> 00:45:03.630
<v Speaker 1>intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

779
00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:11.630
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you might ask,</v>

780
00:45:21.081 --> 00:45:21.914
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

781
00:45:22.130 --> 00:45:25.460
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what exactly is intelligence?</v>

782
00:45:25.610 --> 00:45:28.310
<v Speaker 1>Maybe what exactly is the ability to</v>
<v Speaker 1>abstract,</v>

783
00:45:28.311 --> 00:45:33.311
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's something like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The world is made out of</v>

784
00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:40.540
<v Speaker 1>the world is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very high resolution place.</v>

785
00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:44.190
<v Speaker 1>No matter how much you zoom into</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

786
00:45:44.191 --> 00:45:47.940
<v Speaker 1>you can zoom in more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's information that more and more</v>

787
00:45:47.941 --> 00:45:52.170
<v Speaker 1>and more and more levels of detail and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then also no matter how far you back</v>

788
00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:55.290
<v Speaker 1>away from something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's more and more and more levels of</v>

789
00:45:55.291 --> 00:45:58.800
<v Speaker 1>detail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know you guys are composed of a</v>

790
00:45:58.801 --> 00:46:02.700
<v Speaker 1>whole variety of sub systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>complex functioning subsystems all the</v>

791
00:46:02.701 --> 00:46:07.350
<v Speaker 1>way down to the subatomic level and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>above your phenomenal logical level of</v>

792
00:46:07.351 --> 00:46:09.860
<v Speaker 1>perception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're members of families,</v>

793
00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:14.010
<v Speaker 1>members of cities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're members of provinces and and</v>

794
00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:19.340
<v Speaker 1>nationalities and international</v>
<v Speaker 1>organizations and ecological structures</v>

795
00:46:20.101 --> 00:46:25.101
<v Speaker 1>and so forth and so on and all of that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>characteristic of you all the time and</v>

796
00:46:26.491 --> 00:46:29.010
<v Speaker 1>in every situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't deal with all that</v>

797
00:46:29.011 --> 00:46:32.610
<v Speaker 1>information and you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that people</v>

798
00:46:32.611 --> 00:46:35.400
<v Speaker 1>seem to have learned how to do is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>abstract from that.</v>

799
00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:38.490
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not exactly sure what it means</v>
<v Speaker 1>to abstract,</v>

800
00:46:38.491 --> 00:46:43.130
<v Speaker 1>but it seems to me that it means</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's similar to producing a</v>

801
00:46:43.140 --> 00:46:45.810
<v Speaker 1>low resolution representations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a thumbnail.</v>

802
00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:48.120
<v Speaker 1>And so actually when I look at each of</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

803
00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:51.570
<v Speaker 1>what I'm actually seeing is a thumbnail</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what you are.</v>

804
00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:53.160
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

805
00:46:53.161 --> 00:46:56.100
<v Speaker 1>obviously I don't see the other side of</v>
<v Speaker 1>you that or,</v>

806
00:46:56.130 --> 00:46:58.540
<v Speaker 1>or either side for that matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I only see you face,</v>

807
00:46:58.541 --> 00:47:00.810
<v Speaker 1>so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in some sense it's a two dimensional,</v>

808
00:47:01.170 --> 00:47:02.280
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thumbnail.</v>

809
00:47:02.281 --> 00:47:06.390
<v Speaker 1>And then I have no idea what's going on</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the subsystems that,</v>

810
00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:10.140
<v Speaker 1>that constitute you at levels outside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

811
00:47:10.141 --> 00:47:14.310
<v Speaker 1>underneath your mirror surface.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a complex diagnostic problem.</v>

812
00:47:14.311 --> 00:47:15.930
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there was something wrong with you</v>

813
00:47:15.931 --> 00:47:20.931
<v Speaker 1>and I can't see your families are except</v>
<v Speaker 1>in very low resolution ways,</v>

814
00:47:21.481 --> 00:47:26.430
<v Speaker 1>your nationality or any of the systems</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're identified with an embedded</v>

815
00:47:26.431 --> 00:47:27.264
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

816
00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:30.580
<v Speaker 1>So just looking at you as an act of</v>
<v Speaker 1>abstraction,</v>

817
00:47:31.150 --> 00:47:33.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and part of that thankfully is done by</v>

818
00:47:33.911 --> 00:47:36.550
<v Speaker 1>the fact that our sensory systems just</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't that good.</v>

819
00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:39.160
<v Speaker 1>So there's a whole bunch of things we</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't perceive.</v>

820
00:47:39.490 --> 00:47:44.080
<v Speaker 1>And that simplifies the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what we're hoping is that I can</v>

821
00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:49.120
<v Speaker 1>perceive enough of you at a given time</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that if I interact with you,</v>

822
00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:51.760
<v Speaker 1>I get what I want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you get what you want,</v>

823
00:47:51.761 --> 00:47:53.860
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something like that.</v>

824
00:47:54.250 --> 00:47:58.720
<v Speaker 1>So what we hope is the model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the abstract model even of perception</v>

825
00:47:58.721 --> 00:48:03.010
<v Speaker 1>itself is sufficiently accurate so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sufficiently,</v>

826
00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:07.420
<v Speaker 1>it's a sufficiently unbiased sample of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reality that it reflects so that if</v>

827
00:48:07.421 --> 00:48:09.820
<v Speaker 1>I interact with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things work out the way that I would</v>

828
00:48:09.821 --> 00:48:12.610
<v Speaker 1>like them to work out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's lots of times when that</v>

829
00:48:12.611 --> 00:48:14.220
<v Speaker 1>doesn't happen at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

830
00:48:14.221 --> 00:48:15.850
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't happen when you're sick.</v>

831
00:48:16.330 --> 00:48:20.620
<v Speaker 1>The fact is that you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The resolution of your sensory apparatus</v>

832
00:48:20.650 --> 00:48:23.800
<v Speaker 1>is a huge impediment to figuring out why</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might be ill,</v>

833
00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:25.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it doesn't help much either when</v>

834
00:48:25.901 --> 00:48:29.680
<v Speaker 1>people are engaged in struggles that go</v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond the merely personal.</v>

835
00:48:29.681 --> 00:48:33.100
<v Speaker 1>So if we happen to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I happened to be the member of one</v>

836
00:48:33.101 --> 00:48:36.670
<v Speaker 1>ethnic group and you happened to be the</v>
<v Speaker 1>member of another and there is strife</v>

837
00:48:36.671 --> 00:48:40.450
<v Speaker 1>between those two ethnic groups than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that I can perceive you at this</v>

838
00:48:40.451 --> 00:48:43.900
<v Speaker 1>level of resolution might have very</v>
<v Speaker 1>little to do with my ability to solve</v>

839
00:48:43.901 --> 00:48:48.901
<v Speaker 1>that particular problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now obviously people can obstruct and</v>

840
00:48:49.021 --> 00:48:51.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of that's just built into us so</v>

841
00:48:51.281 --> 00:48:53.530
<v Speaker 1>that we abstract the phenomena that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

842
00:48:53.770 --> 00:48:57.550
<v Speaker 1>but then human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in some sense are capable of</v>

843
00:48:57.551 --> 00:49:00.460
<v Speaker 1>metta abstraction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think what happens is you can</v>

844
00:49:00.461 --> 00:49:03.580
<v Speaker 1>imagine that there's the phenomenon in</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of itself,</v>

845
00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:06.460
<v Speaker 1>whatever that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that complicated multilayered thing</v>

846
00:49:06.461 --> 00:49:09.880
<v Speaker 1>that's always in front of you and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's your representation of it,</v>

847
00:49:09.881 --> 00:49:14.881
<v Speaker 1>which is what you perceive which is</v>
<v Speaker 1>already extracted to a tremendous degree</v>

848
00:49:15.161 --> 00:49:16.870
<v Speaker 1>and limited to a tremendous degree.</v>

849
00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:21.390
<v Speaker 1>And then there's abstractions of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what seemed,</v>

850
00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:26.400
<v Speaker 1>what it seems to me to be the is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>language is a thumbnail of images that</v>

851
00:49:27.191 --> 00:49:29.530
<v Speaker 1>are a thumbnail of the reality of</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

852
00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:32.350
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a dual compression.</v>

853
00:49:32.351 --> 00:49:36.130
<v Speaker 1>So if I say to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll what,</v>

854
00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:40.300
<v Speaker 1>what the word cat does for you is</v>
<v Speaker 1>produced the image of a generic cat,</v>

855
00:49:40.330 --> 00:49:44.410
<v Speaker 1>which is already a kind of abstraction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that's attached to your</v>

856
00:49:44.411 --> 00:49:46.900
<v Speaker 1>understanding in some sense so that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can.</v>

857
00:49:47.290 --> 00:49:52.150
<v Speaker 1>You can generate the understanding that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would go along with at least in part</v>

858
00:49:52.151 --> 00:49:54.730
<v Speaker 1>with perceiving or interacting with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>real cat,</v>

859
00:49:55.090 --> 00:49:59.530
<v Speaker 1>so in some sense what you're doing is</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm compressing the information down to</v>

860
00:49:59.531 --> 00:50:04.531
<v Speaker 1>a tremendous Lee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a low resolution thumbnail and I'm</v>

861
00:50:05.591 --> 00:50:09.160
<v Speaker 1>throwing that at you and you decompress</v>
<v Speaker 1>it into a low resolution image and then</v>

862
00:50:09.161 --> 00:50:12.640
<v Speaker 1>you decompress that into something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's roughly equivalent to reality.</v>

863
00:50:12.970 --> 00:50:15.460
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're doing when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>reading a book,</v>

864
00:50:15.461 --> 00:50:16.330
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

865
00:50:16.331 --> 00:50:19.540
<v Speaker 1>Because when you read the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can conjure up images of the places</v>

866
00:50:19.541 --> 00:50:22.870
<v Speaker 1>that the author is talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You conjure up images of the characters</v>

867
00:50:22.871 --> 00:50:27.320
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to such a degree that if you go see a</v>

868
00:50:27.321 --> 00:50:30.320
<v Speaker 1>movie that's made of your favorite book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might be irritated because of the</v>

869
00:50:30.321 --> 00:50:33.170
<v Speaker 1>person in the movie looks nothing like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the person that you read about,</v>

870
00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:35.240
<v Speaker 1>at least as far as your imagination was</v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned.</v>

871
00:50:35.780 --> 00:50:40.780
<v Speaker 1>Now intelligence in general seems to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever underlies the ability to</v>

872
00:50:40.791 --> 00:50:45.791
<v Speaker 1>generate those low resolution</v>
<v Speaker 1>representations to and to utilize them,</v>

873
00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:49.070
<v Speaker 1>so that would mean to manipulate them in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your own mind,</v>

874
00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:54.530
<v Speaker 1>but also to communicate them to others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A big part of intelligence is working</v>

875
00:50:54.531 --> 00:50:59.270
<v Speaker 1>memory and working memory is well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while you're sitting there thinking</v>

876
00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:03.470
<v Speaker 1>if you're thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many of you think in words primarily</v>

877
00:51:03.471 --> 00:51:08.060
<v Speaker 1>as far as you're concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how many of you don't</v>

878
00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:12.450
<v Speaker 1>thinking images?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody?</v>

879
00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:13.553
<v Speaker 1>Images?</v>

880
00:51:15.070 --> 00:51:16.430
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

881
00:51:21.250 --> 00:51:24.070
<v Speaker 1>well that's another possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of you think in words and</v>

882
00:51:24.071 --> 00:51:25.750
<v Speaker 1>images?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

883
00:51:25.780 --> 00:51:26.613
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

884
00:51:26.860 --> 00:51:27.611
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

885
00:51:27.611 --> 00:51:28.600
<v Speaker 1>well that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

886
00:51:28.601 --> 00:51:32.020
<v Speaker 1>the images are already a representation</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in many ways the words are a</v>

887
00:51:32.021 --> 00:51:36.460
<v Speaker 1>representation of the images.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so your ability to abstract and then</v>

888
00:51:36.461 --> 00:51:39.700
<v Speaker 1>your ability to manipulate those</v>
<v Speaker 1>abstractions seems to be at the core of</v>

889
00:51:39.701 --> 00:51:43.240
<v Speaker 1>whatever intelligence is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what Iq purports to measure.</v>

890
00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:46.030
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your working memory.</v>

891
00:51:47.050 --> 00:51:49.840
<v Speaker 1>So when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you sit there right now,</v>

892
00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:51.280
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's do this.</v>

893
00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:53.860
<v Speaker 1>Here's the sentence to think about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

894
00:51:53.861 --> 00:51:56.800
<v Speaker 1>Now think about that sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

895
00:51:56.801 --> 00:52:01.801
<v Speaker 1>So the faculty that you're using to</v>
<v Speaker 1>represent that sentence to yourself is</v>

896
00:52:04.571 --> 00:52:07.900
<v Speaker 1>working memory and it's not very</v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful.</v>

897
00:52:08.140 --> 00:52:10.360
<v Speaker 1>You can't contain very much in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>working memory.</v>

898
00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:15.010
<v Speaker 1>Seven digits is about the maximum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now people vary.</v>

899
00:52:15.310 --> 00:52:18.670
<v Speaker 1>Some people think that four bits of</v>
<v Speaker 1>information is actually the limit to</v>

900
00:52:18.671 --> 00:52:19.300
<v Speaker 1>working memory.</v>

901
00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:22.150
<v Speaker 1>Some people think it's closer to seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not very much.</v>

902
00:52:22.420 --> 00:52:25.090
<v Speaker 1>That's why telephone numbers tend to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven digits long,</v>

903
00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:27.670
<v Speaker 1>so you can kind of easily remember seven</v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

904
00:52:27.671 --> 00:52:30.250
<v Speaker 1>which is not very many things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

905
00:52:30.251 --> 00:52:34.180
<v Speaker 1>so part of what your intelligence is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the breadth of that working memory and</v>

906
00:52:34.181 --> 00:52:37.900
<v Speaker 1>then the speed with which you can run</v>
<v Speaker 1>abstractions through it.</v>

907
00:52:38.770 --> 00:52:42.730
<v Speaker 1>So now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've put a little map here up.</v>

908
00:52:42.731 --> 00:52:46.450
<v Speaker 1>So the thing on the top left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's sort of a multidimensional.</v>

909
00:52:46.510 --> 00:52:49.800
<v Speaker 1>It's a scheme of a multidimensional</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality and I,</v>

910
00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:51.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at that,</v>

911
00:52:52.090 --> 00:52:54.760
<v Speaker 1>what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a collection of dots or circles</v>

912
00:52:54.761 --> 00:52:56.830
<v Speaker 1>arrayed in a variety of different</v>
<v Speaker 1>arrays.</v>

913
00:52:57.400 --> 00:53:01.840
<v Speaker 1>My proposition is that you can represent</v>
<v Speaker 1>that array in a variety of different</v>

914
00:53:01.841 --> 00:53:03.670
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've called them object one.</v>

915
00:53:03.850 --> 00:53:08.410
<v Speaker 1>You can't see object to slide error</v>
<v Speaker 1>object three d object for an object</v>

916
00:53:08.411 --> 00:53:08.710
<v Speaker 1>five.</v>

917
00:53:08.710 --> 00:53:11.860
<v Speaker 1>Those are all low resolution</v>
<v Speaker 1>representations of the thing that's in</v>

918
00:53:11.861 --> 00:53:15.610
<v Speaker 1>the top left hand corner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can see that in some sense they</v>

919
00:53:15.611 --> 00:53:20.611
<v Speaker 1>capture something important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they capture some important element of</v>

920
00:53:21.041 --> 00:53:23.710
<v Speaker 1>the thing in the top left hand corner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't capture all of it.</v>

921
00:53:24.190 --> 00:53:26.220
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be that capturing all of it is</v>

922
00:53:26.221 --> 00:53:29.340
<v Speaker 1>a good idea because you don't want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>use any more information than you have</v>

923
00:53:29.341 --> 00:53:31.110
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then at the bottom,</v>

924
00:53:31.111 --> 00:53:34.980
<v Speaker 1>well those are words or semantic symbols</v>
<v Speaker 1>of one form or another.</v>

925
00:53:34.981 --> 00:53:38.530
<v Speaker 1>And they represent the representations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

926
00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:44.820
<v Speaker 1>I saw temple grandin speak once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember if I told you about</v>

927
00:53:44.821 --> 00:53:47.010
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she's a very famous autistic</v>

928
00:53:47.011 --> 00:53:48.720
<v Speaker 1>researcher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

929
00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:52.110
<v Speaker 1>and she's quite autistic and she's very</v>
<v Speaker 1>fun to listen to.</v>

930
00:53:52.460 --> 00:53:54.270
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's quite a good public speaker,</v>

931
00:53:54.271 --> 00:53:56.350
<v Speaker 1>which is quite remarkable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

932
00:53:57.030 --> 00:53:59.840
<v Speaker 1>she's trying to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she thinks that autistic people think</v>

933
00:53:59.850 --> 00:54:04.710
<v Speaker 1>like animals and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she actually works with animals and</v>

934
00:54:04.711 --> 00:54:06.570
<v Speaker 1>she seems to be very good at</v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding them.</v>

935
00:54:06.610 --> 00:54:08.820
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she believes that what things that</v>

936
00:54:08.821 --> 00:54:11.850
<v Speaker 1>frightened her are the same thing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>frightens animals and for the same</v>

937
00:54:11.851 --> 00:54:14.580
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so her proposition for example,</v>

938
00:54:14.581 --> 00:54:19.581
<v Speaker 1>is that if I say the word church,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of you people are going to have what</v>

939
00:54:21.631 --> 00:54:25.560
<v Speaker 1>you might describe as a schematic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>abstraction like a hero glyphs that's</v>

940
00:54:25.561 --> 00:54:28.590
<v Speaker 1>more or less representative of the class</v>
<v Speaker 1>of churches and so.</v>

941
00:54:28.860 --> 00:54:31.500
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe I can say house kids are good</v>
<v Speaker 1>at this.</v>

942
00:54:31.501 --> 00:54:35.190
<v Speaker 1>You see this house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's got a little rectangle on</v>

943
00:54:35.191 --> 00:54:37.740
<v Speaker 1>the top and it's got a kind of a square</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the bottom.</v>

944
00:54:37.741 --> 00:54:40.860
<v Speaker 1>It's got a door and two windows and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>windows have crosses in them and there's</v>

945
00:54:40.861 --> 00:54:42.960
<v Speaker 1>always a chimney on the top with smoke</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming out.</v>

946
00:54:43.170 --> 00:54:46.530
<v Speaker 1>Which I think is quite remarkable</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you actually don't see that many</v>

947
00:54:46.531 --> 00:54:48.570
<v Speaker 1>houses now that have chimneys with smoke</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming out.</v>

948
00:54:48.570 --> 00:54:53.570
<v Speaker 1>But still that's the canonical image for</v>
<v Speaker 1>a child temple grandin's claim was that</v>

949
00:54:55.350 --> 00:55:00.350
<v Speaker 1>she cannot see house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She can only see a house.</v>

950
00:55:01.050 --> 00:55:04.680
<v Speaker 1>And so if you say to her something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>house than what comes to mind is a</v>

951
00:55:04.770 --> 00:55:07.140
<v Speaker 1>particular house that she's actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced.</v>

952
00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:10.980
<v Speaker 1>She can't take the next level of</v>
<v Speaker 1>abstraction past that,</v>

953
00:55:10.981 --> 00:55:15.000
<v Speaker 1>which seems to be something like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>deficit in generating like a hero</v>

954
00:55:15.001 --> 00:55:17.700
<v Speaker 1>glyphic image.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the ways to think about</v>

955
00:55:17.701 --> 00:55:19.650
<v Speaker 1>children's drawings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know how they draw people with</v>

956
00:55:19.651 --> 00:55:21.000
<v Speaker 1>sticks and circles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

957
00:55:21.001 --> 00:55:21.391
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

958
00:55:21.391 --> 00:55:22.620
<v Speaker 1>that's so primitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

959
00:55:22.621 --> 00:55:23.221
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

960
00:55:23.221 --> 00:55:26.190
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievably sophisticated because</v>
<v Speaker 1>those aren't pictures.</v>

961
00:55:26.191 --> 00:55:30.150
<v Speaker 1>They're here glyphic and the child</v>
<v Speaker 1>automatically produces them and that's a</v>

962
00:55:30.151 --> 00:55:34.890
<v Speaker 1>protocol linguistic development.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So some autistic kids can draw like</v>

963
00:55:34.891 --> 00:55:38.550
<v Speaker 1>Leonardo Davinci with no training</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever and that's partly because</v>

964
00:55:38.551 --> 00:55:41.880
<v Speaker 1>they don't use here glyphic and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>means that they don't really</v>

965
00:55:41.881 --> 00:55:45.480
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize the thing they're looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>at as an abstraction.</v>

966
00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:49.560
<v Speaker 1>They see nothing but detail and if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're training yourself to be a visual</v>

967
00:55:49.561 --> 00:55:51.540
<v Speaker 1>artists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to stop looking at the</v>

968
00:55:51.541 --> 00:55:55.050
<v Speaker 1>abstraction and you have to start</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at the thing and that's very</v>

969
00:55:55.051 --> 00:55:57.810
<v Speaker 1>unsettling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you take your hand for example,</v>

970
00:55:58.110 --> 00:56:02.010
<v Speaker 1>and you look at it and you snap it out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of hand representation,</v>

971
00:56:02.520 --> 00:56:04.770
<v Speaker 1>when you do that property,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it all of a sudden it looks like some</v>

972
00:56:04.771 --> 00:56:08.970
<v Speaker 1>kind of like octopus claw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very bizarre looking thing and as</v>

973
00:56:08.971 --> 00:56:10.860
<v Speaker 1>soon as you see it that way you can draw</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

974
00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:13.260
<v Speaker 1>but as long as you're seeing it like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hand,</v>

975
00:56:13.261 --> 00:56:14.160
<v Speaker 1>you're going to put,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

976
00:56:14.350 --> 00:56:16.380
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a balloon with four balloons on it or</v>

977
00:56:16.381 --> 00:56:18.390
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's going to be the hand.</v>

978
00:56:18.930 --> 00:56:20.730
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

979
00:56:29.710 --> 00:56:33.430
<v Speaker 1>This guy's name is John Carol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carol's a real scientist.</v>

980
00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:35.680
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he looked at</v>

981
00:56:38.370 --> 00:56:40.860
<v Speaker 1>the structure of Iq for a very long</v>
<v Speaker 1>period of time,</v>

982
00:56:40.861 --> 00:56:43.200
<v Speaker 1>wrote a very thick book on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

983
00:56:44.130 --> 00:56:47.910
<v Speaker 1>which nobody likes to read because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost entirely technical.</v>

984
00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:51.480
<v Speaker 1>So it's really more of a reference book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what,</v>

985
00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:57.750
<v Speaker 1>what Carol hypothesized and I think his</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis is as close to state of the</v>

986
00:56:57.751 --> 00:56:59.490
<v Speaker 1>arc as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as any,</v>

987
00:56:59.491 --> 00:57:03.540
<v Speaker 1>is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a stratum three level which is</v>

988
00:57:03.541 --> 00:57:04.620
<v Speaker 1>fluid intelligence</v>

989
00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:06.633
<v Speaker 3>g,</v>

990
00:57:08.180 --> 00:57:11.390
<v Speaker 1>and it's the main factor that unites all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these other tests.</v>

991
00:57:11.391 --> 00:57:13.940
<v Speaker 1>And then net stratum one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get fluid intelligence,</v>

992
00:57:13.941 --> 00:57:16.550
<v Speaker 1>crystallized intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>verbal intelligence.</v>

993
00:57:16.730 --> 00:57:18.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what the rest of them</v>
<v Speaker 1>stand for.</v>

994
00:57:18.681 --> 00:57:23.420
<v Speaker 1>And then each of those can be subdivided</v>
<v Speaker 1>into specific tests in each of the tests</v>

995
00:57:23.421 --> 00:57:28.421
<v Speaker 1>can be subdivided into somewhat</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularized individual cognitive</v>

996
00:57:29.601 --> 00:57:33.950
<v Speaker 1>abilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they're not that individual because</v>

997
00:57:33.951 --> 00:57:36.650
<v Speaker 1>there's a single factor that accounts</v>
<v Speaker 1>for most of the variability in the</v>

998
00:57:36.651 --> 00:57:37.484
<v Speaker 1>performance.</v>

999
00:57:37.850 --> 00:57:38.683
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1000
00:57:41.420 --> 00:57:43.760
<v Speaker 1>in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what this theory says is that the</v>

1001
00:57:43.761 --> 00:57:48.230
<v Speaker 1>intelligence is sum up to one</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence and that seems to be</v>

1002
00:57:49.130 --> 00:57:50.180
<v Speaker 1>essentially correct</v>

1003
00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:54.840
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although you can't see it very well,</v>

1004
00:57:55.800 --> 00:57:58.440
<v Speaker 1>if you look at ge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're on the left,</v>

1005
00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:03.890
<v Speaker 1>the lines leading to the first or the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the second strategy,</v>

1006
00:58:03.900 --> 00:58:08.460
<v Speaker 1>the next strata anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>show you the correlation between Ge and</v>

1007
00:58:08.461 --> 00:58:12.120
<v Speaker 1>each of the individual intelligence is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what you see is the correlation</v>

1008
00:58:12.121 --> 00:58:15.840
<v Speaker 1>between Ge and fluid intelligence is</v>
<v Speaker 1>point nine four,</v>

1009
00:58:15.841 --> 00:58:18.660
<v Speaker 1>which is such a tight correlation that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might as well just be the thing</v>

1010
00:58:18.661 --> 00:58:23.661
<v Speaker 1>itself between</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ge and crystallized intelligence is</v>

1011
00:58:24.451 --> 00:58:28.320
<v Speaker 1>point eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five m all of the first order</v>

1012
00:58:28.321 --> 00:58:31.620
<v Speaker 1>correlations there above point eight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly.</v>

1013
00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:36.210
<v Speaker 1>And then at the far right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get concepts that you might think</v>

1014
00:58:36.211 --> 00:58:41.010
<v Speaker 1>about as particularized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so those include concept formation,</v>

1015
00:58:41.011 --> 00:58:44.340
<v Speaker 1>analysis and synthesis number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>series number matrices,</v>

1016
00:58:44.341 --> 00:58:46.590
<v Speaker 1>spatial relations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>picture recognition,</v>

1017
00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:48.750
<v Speaker 1>block rotation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>visual matching,</v>

1018
00:58:48.751 --> 00:58:50.990
<v Speaker 1>decision speed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1019
00:58:51.450 --> 00:58:56.310
<v Speaker 1>block rotation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cross out visual and auditory learning,</v>

1020
00:58:56.311 --> 00:58:58.050
<v Speaker 1>memory for names,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sound blending,</v>

1021
00:58:58.051 --> 00:59:00.720
<v Speaker 1>incomplete word that would be incomplete</v>
<v Speaker 1>word completion,</v>

1022
00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:03.570
<v Speaker 1>sound patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>auditory attention,</v>

1023
00:59:03.590 --> 00:59:04.530
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

1024
00:59:04.531 --> 00:59:08.190
<v Speaker 1>And you can think of those each as</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual tests in that you could make</v>

1025
00:59:08.191 --> 00:59:11.610
<v Speaker 1>a test that theoretically only</v>
<v Speaker 1>individually assessed that thing,</v>

1026
00:59:11.611 --> 00:59:15.540
<v Speaker 1>but you couldn't help but be testing all</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of other things at the same time</v>

1027
00:59:15.541 --> 00:59:17.520
<v Speaker 1>because they're not actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>individually.</v>

1028
00:59:17.820 --> 00:59:22.200
<v Speaker 1>One of the things you will learn</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that</v>

1029
00:59:24.310 --> 00:59:28.660
<v Speaker 1>there are neuro psychological tests and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the neuro psychologists like to think</v>

1030
00:59:28.661 --> 00:59:32.680
<v Speaker 1>that Iq is something that's primitive</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that they've already,</v>

1031
00:59:33.060 --> 00:59:36.040
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you say advanced past.</v>

1032
00:59:36.310 --> 00:59:37.900
<v Speaker 1>And so they have specific</v>

1033
00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:44.280
<v Speaker 1>prefrontal tests say that hypothetically</v>
<v Speaker 1>assess specific prefrontal abilities.</v>

1034
00:59:45.220 --> 00:59:48.670
<v Speaker 1>And then they'll note that if you take a</v>
<v Speaker 1>single test of prefrontal ability and</v>

1035
00:59:48.671 --> 00:59:51.340
<v Speaker 1>correlated with Iq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll only correlated about point three</v>

1036
00:59:51.341 --> 00:59:54.040
<v Speaker 1>or point four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they'll assume because it only</v>

1037
00:59:54.041 --> 00:59:57.700
<v Speaker 1>correlates that low,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's measuring something other than</v>

1038
00:59:57.701 --> 01:00:01.030
<v Speaker 1>what Iq is measuring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But really what happens is that it's</v>

1039
01:00:01.031 --> 01:00:04.750
<v Speaker 1>just not a very good Iq test and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>reason that the correlation is so low is</v>

1040
01:00:04.751 --> 01:00:08.410
<v Speaker 1>because of measurement error.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you gave the same test to the same</v>

1041
01:00:08.411 --> 01:00:13.270
<v Speaker 1>person 20 times and then you varied the</v>
<v Speaker 1>tasks so that were 30 variants of it and</v>

1042
01:00:13.271 --> 01:00:15.790
<v Speaker 1>you gave those all to the same person 20</v>
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>

1043
01:00:15.791 --> 01:00:19.000
<v Speaker 1>then what would come out would be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>score that would be much more highly</v>

1044
01:00:19.001 --> 01:00:22.630
<v Speaker 1>correlated with Iq and probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>indistinguishable from it.</v>

1045
01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:26.200
<v Speaker 1>And so you'll learn from</v>
<v Speaker 1>neuropsychologists that there's such a</v>

1046
01:00:26.201 --> 01:00:30.400
<v Speaker 1>thing as prefrontal ability and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with executive control and</v>

1047
01:00:30.401 --> 01:00:34.000
<v Speaker 1>that's associated with self regulation</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would be control over your</v>

1048
01:00:34.001 --> 01:00:34.750
<v Speaker 1>impulses.</v>

1049
01:00:34.750 --> 01:00:37.510
<v Speaker 1>And as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all completely wrong.</v>

1050
01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:41.380
<v Speaker 1>And it took me like 10 years to figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>that out because I was taught that it</v>

1051
01:00:41.381 --> 01:00:46.381
<v Speaker 1>was right and it wasn't until I plow</v>
<v Speaker 1>through it painfully and understood that</v>

1052
01:00:47.111 --> 01:00:49.750
<v Speaker 1>there was no evidence for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I can tell you how that works.</v>

1053
01:00:49.751 --> 01:00:52.690
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we gave a neuro psych battery that</v>

1054
01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:56.410
<v Speaker 1>consisted of Dorsolateral prefrontal</v>
<v Speaker 1>test to 3000 people.</v>

1055
01:00:56.411 --> 01:01:00.490
<v Speaker 1>It was a 90 minute battery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was exhaustive and when we factor</v>

1056
01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:02.560
<v Speaker 1>analyzed it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when there was only about 200</v>

1057
01:01:02.561 --> 01:01:04.600
<v Speaker 1>participants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got four factors,</v>

1058
01:01:05.140 --> 01:01:08.770
<v Speaker 1>but then when we factor analyzed it</v>
<v Speaker 1>after we had 3000 participants,</v>

1059
01:01:08.771 --> 01:01:13.630
<v Speaker 1>we got two factors and one was one on</v>
<v Speaker 1>which almost all of the tests loaded and</v>

1060
01:01:13.631 --> 01:01:16.750
<v Speaker 1>it was undoubtedly fluid intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1061
01:01:17.290 --> 01:01:18.730
<v Speaker 1>but it's worse than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1062
01:01:18.731 --> 01:01:22.360
<v Speaker 1>because you hear about how the</v>
<v Speaker 1>prefrontal cortex regulates behavior.</v>

1063
01:01:22.361 --> 01:01:23.830
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the problem with that.</v>

1064
01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.940
<v Speaker 1>What's the correlation between Iq and</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness?</v>

1065
01:01:29.740 --> 01:01:32.290
<v Speaker 1>Zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

1066
01:01:32.350 --> 01:01:36.430
<v Speaker 1>it's probably a little off zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it might not be and you know</v>

1067
01:01:36.431 --> 01:01:39.880
<v Speaker 1>that because the dimensions of the big</v>
<v Speaker 1>five or roughly orthogonal I showed you</v>

1068
01:01:39.881 --> 01:01:43.090
<v Speaker 1>at the beginning of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that each trait of the big five traits</v>

1069
01:01:43.091 --> 01:01:46.810
<v Speaker 1>is correlated with the other trade on an</v>
<v Speaker 1>average of about point two.</v>

1070
01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:50.220
<v Speaker 1>Now why that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably because of something like,</v>

1071
01:01:51.740 --> 01:01:52.573
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1072
01:01:53.790 --> 01:01:56.640
<v Speaker 1>what would you call?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably a halo effect.</v>

1073
01:01:56.641 --> 01:02:00.030
<v Speaker 1>If you tend to rate yourself as positive</v>
<v Speaker 1>on one trait,</v>

1074
01:02:00.450 --> 01:02:02.040
<v Speaker 1>more conscientious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more agreeable,</v>

1075
01:02:02.041 --> 01:02:05.400
<v Speaker 1>more emotionally stable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to tend to rate yourself as</v>

1076
01:02:05.401 --> 01:02:09.300
<v Speaker 1>more positive on the other traits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that would artificially inflate their</v>

1077
01:02:09.301 --> 01:02:12.090
<v Speaker 1>correlation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of looking at it anyways.</v>

1078
01:02:12.150 --> 01:02:14.400
<v Speaker 1>Weirdly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the correlation between</v>

1079
01:02:14.401 --> 01:02:17.040
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness in ICU is essentially</v>
<v Speaker 1>zero.</v>

1080
01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:18.540
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a big problem,</v>

1081
01:02:18.541 --> 01:02:21.540
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's unconscientious people that seem to</v>

1082
01:02:21.541 --> 01:02:24.210
<v Speaker 1>be behaviorally dysregulated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1083
01:02:24.211 --> 01:02:25.740
<v Speaker 1>They can't stick to a task.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

1084
01:02:26.010 --> 01:02:27.200
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they jump about,</v>

1085
01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:28.590
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not on track.</v>

1086
01:02:28.770 --> 01:02:31.470
<v Speaker 1>They appear impulsive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although we don't know how to define</v>

1087
01:02:31.471 --> 01:02:34.110
<v Speaker 1>impulsive by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but your hill psychologists use that all</v>

1088
01:02:34.111 --> 01:02:35.400
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1089
01:02:35.850 --> 01:02:37.800
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if prefrontal ability regulates</v>

1090
01:02:37.801 --> 01:02:39.960
<v Speaker 1>behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how come the correlation between</v>

1091
01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:45.600
<v Speaker 1>intelligence and other forms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>executive control are correlated with</v>

1092
01:02:47.791 --> 01:02:50.010
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness at zero?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1093
01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:52.950
<v Speaker 1>Zero is a very bad number when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>testing out a hypothesis.</v>

1094
01:02:53.610 --> 01:02:55.140
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1095
01:02:55.141 --> 01:02:57.660
<v Speaker 1>if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has to be that way and the reason it</v>

1096
01:02:57.661 --> 01:03:01.680
<v Speaker 1>has to be that way is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you're dreaming,</v>

1097
01:03:02.220 --> 01:03:03.720
<v Speaker 1>you're going to just lay there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>dream,</v>

1098
01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:05.490
<v Speaker 1>but your eyes are going to move back and</v>
<v Speaker 1>forth.</v>

1099
01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:09.630
<v Speaker 1>Now you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why aren't you running around acting out</v>

1100
01:03:09.631 --> 01:03:12.150
<v Speaker 1>your dreams while you're dreaming?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is there's a</v>

1101
01:03:12.151 --> 01:03:14.910
<v Speaker 1>little switch in your head roughly</v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking,</v>

1102
01:03:15.330 --> 01:03:18.330
<v Speaker 1>that shuts off your motor apparatus when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're dreaming.</v>

1103
01:03:18.331 --> 01:03:21.840
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens is you can't run</v>
<v Speaker 1>around and act out all your dreams</v>

1104
01:03:21.841 --> 01:03:25.650
<v Speaker 1>because you're paralyzed and sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 1>people wake up in that state.</v>

1105
01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:27.480
<v Speaker 1>It's called sleep paralysis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wake up,</v>

1106
01:03:27.510 --> 01:03:29.730
<v Speaker 1>they're sort of half awake and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't move,</v>

1107
01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:33.150
<v Speaker 1>and then they often hallucinate all</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of weird things and thinks aliens</v>

1108
01:03:33.151 --> 01:03:36.300
<v Speaker 1>have come and abducted them and various</v>
<v Speaker 1>peculiarities.</v>

1109
01:03:36.301 --> 01:03:40.290
<v Speaker 1>But if you take a cat and you take out</v>
<v Speaker 1>that little switch,</v>

1110
01:03:40.291 --> 01:03:41.970
<v Speaker 1>then the cattle run around while it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>dreaming,</v>

1111
01:03:41.971 --> 01:03:45.900
<v Speaker 1>until it runs into something which is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem with running around acting</v>

1112
01:03:45.901 --> 01:03:50.901
<v Speaker 1>out your dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what does that allow one to conclude?</v>

1113
01:03:52.770 --> 01:03:56.040
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you couldn't abstract away from your</v>

1114
01:03:56.041 --> 01:04:00.270
<v Speaker 1>behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't think right because what</v>

1115
01:04:00.271 --> 01:04:05.271
<v Speaker 1>thinking means is to represent an</v>
<v Speaker 1>alternative world or maybe just a tiny</v>

1116
01:04:06.601 --> 01:04:08.430
<v Speaker 1>little fraction of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

1117
01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:11.790
<v Speaker 1>to represent it abstractly to manipulate</v>
<v Speaker 1>it around,</v>

1118
01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:16.830
<v Speaker 1>but not to simultaneously acted out that</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it wouldn't be abstracting it all.</v>

1119
01:04:16.831 --> 01:04:19.800
<v Speaker 1>It would be fiddling about with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world through trial and error.</v>

1120
01:04:20.010 --> 01:04:23.340
<v Speaker 1>So you have to be able to pull what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about out of your body,</v>

1121
01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:25.650
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>play with it,</v>

1122
01:04:25.651 --> 01:04:29.160
<v Speaker 1>and then implement it back in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it looks maybe like the ability to</v>

1123
01:04:29.161 --> 01:04:32.700
<v Speaker 1>implement a plan is associated with</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness,</v>

1124
01:04:32.701 --> 01:04:36.060
<v Speaker 1>but we don't understand that that would</v>
<v Speaker 1>be industriousness and we don't know a</v>

1125
01:04:36.061 --> 01:04:39.270
<v Speaker 1>bloody thing about industriousness like</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a black hole.</v>

1126
01:04:39.780 --> 01:04:43.800
<v Speaker 1>But the idea that it's your ability to</v>
<v Speaker 1>think that allows you to regulate your</v>

1127
01:04:43.801 --> 01:04:45.110
<v Speaker 1>behavior strikes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1128
01:04:45.150 --> 01:04:47.910
<v Speaker 1>there's no evidence for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no evidence for it.</v>

1129
01:04:48.150 --> 01:04:51.540
<v Speaker 1>Smart people are not necessarily better</v>
<v Speaker 1>at regulating their behavior.</v>

1130
01:04:52.350 --> 01:04:57.350
<v Speaker 1>So because for you can have a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscientious smart person and I see</v>

1131
01:04:57.871 --> 01:05:00.180
<v Speaker 1>them in my clinical practice now and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they come and say,</v>

1132
01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:02.220
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really smart and here's the</v>

1133
01:05:02.221 --> 01:05:04.530
<v Speaker 1>evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm doing very badly and everything.</v>

1134
01:05:04.980 --> 01:05:07.230
<v Speaker 1>They're under achievers roughly</v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking,</v>

1135
01:05:07.830 --> 01:05:10.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they can't implement their thoughts</v>

1136
01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:14.910
<v Speaker 1>not in any stable manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the fact that they're smart</v>

1137
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:21.400
<v Speaker 3>on average across their life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>smart people are healthier mentally and</v>

1138
01:05:21.401 --> 01:05:23.140
<v Speaker 3>physically than people who aren't as</v>
<v Speaker 3>smart.</v>

1139
01:05:23.170 --> 01:05:26.650
<v Speaker 3>But the reason for that isn't because</v>
<v Speaker 3>their intelligence allows them to</v>

1140
01:05:26.651 --> 01:05:29.500
<v Speaker 3>regulate their health.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reason for that is because their</v>

1141
01:05:29.501 --> 01:05:32.920
<v Speaker 3>intelligence allows them roughly</v>
<v Speaker 3>speaking to succeed.</v>

1142
01:05:32.950 --> 01:05:35.950
<v Speaker 3>So they're higher up in the dominance</v>
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy and if you're higher up in the</v>

1143
01:05:35.951 --> 01:05:39.070
<v Speaker 3>dominance hierarchy then your life isn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>as stressful and you don't get sick as</v>

1144
01:05:39.071 --> 01:05:41.140
<v Speaker 3>often.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that doesn't indicate that there's a</v>

1145
01:05:41.141 --> 01:05:43.930
<v Speaker 3>direct control between your intelligence</v>
<v Speaker 3>and your behavioral output.</v>

1146
01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:46.240
<v Speaker 3>There's very little evidence for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1147
01:05:46.241 --> 01:05:49.210
<v Speaker 3>I think there's no evidence for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's rather shocking.</v>

1148
01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:53.530
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me that just wiped out a whole a</v>

1149
01:05:53.531 --> 01:05:58.150
<v Speaker 3>whole substrata of psychological</v>
<v Speaker 3>theorizing and it's,</v>

1150
01:05:58.270 --> 01:06:02.440
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure how many of you have come up</v>
<v Speaker 3>against the proposition that prefrontal</v>

1151
01:06:02.441 --> 01:06:04.810
<v Speaker 3>ability was associated with behavioral</v>
<v Speaker 3>control.</v>

1152
01:06:05.830 --> 01:06:06.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1153
01:06:07.180 --> 01:06:11.320
<v Speaker 3>Well it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

1154
01:06:11.350 --> 01:06:12.790
<v Speaker 3>not anymore than I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

1155
01:06:12.791 --> 01:06:15.650
<v Speaker 3>it's not differentiable from ICU</v>
<v Speaker 3>regardless of what the neuro</v>

1156
01:06:15.651 --> 01:06:18.220
<v Speaker 3>psychologists say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they don't know anything about</v>

1157
01:06:18.221 --> 01:06:20.770
<v Speaker 3>psychometrics generally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they don't like Icu because if they</v>

1158
01:06:20.771 --> 01:06:23.740
<v Speaker 3>studied Iq then what they'd find is all</v>
<v Speaker 3>the things that they're studying are</v>

1159
01:06:23.741 --> 01:06:27.790
<v Speaker 3>basically variants of Iq and that would</v>
<v Speaker 3>suck because other people have already</v>

1160
01:06:27.791 --> 01:06:32.791
<v Speaker 3>figured out Icu and then there's the big</v>
<v Speaker 3>problem which is well variation in</v>

1161
01:06:33.341 --> 01:06:36.010
<v Speaker 3>prefrontal ability which is equivalent</v>
<v Speaker 3>to variation in Iq,</v>

1162
01:06:36.011 --> 01:06:37.960
<v Speaker 3>isn't correlated with behavioral</v>
<v Speaker 3>control,</v>

1163
01:06:38.810 --> 01:06:41.590
<v Speaker 3>is a really big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1164
01:06:42.340 --> 01:06:45.040
<v Speaker 3>And so I would like to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well what is correlated with behavioral</v>

1165
01:06:45.041 --> 01:06:47.200
<v Speaker 3>control and then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the problem with that as well,</v>

1166
01:06:47.201 --> 01:06:49.060
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what you mean by behavioral</v>
<v Speaker 3>control.</v>

1167
01:06:49.061 --> 01:06:50.410
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how you're going to measure</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1168
01:06:50.620 --> 01:06:52.780
<v Speaker 3>And if you do measure it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the probability that you're going to</v>

1169
01:06:52.781 --> 01:06:55.300
<v Speaker 3>come up with something like</v>
<v Speaker 3>conscientiousness is pretty much 100</v>

1170
01:06:55.301 --> 01:06:56.920
<v Speaker 3>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1171
01:06:58.490 --> 01:06:59.620
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

1172
01:07:05.410 --> 01:07:06.243
<v Speaker 1>let's see.</v>

1173
01:07:15.670 --> 01:07:17.190
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>effect sizes.</v>

1174
01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:22.030
<v Speaker 1>This is from a very important paper by a</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy named Hemphill called interpreting</v>

1175
01:07:22.031 --> 01:07:24.820
<v Speaker 1>the magnitudes of correlation</v>
<v Speaker 1>coefficients from the American</v>

1176
01:07:24.821 --> 01:07:28.480
<v Speaker 1>psychologist number 58.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What handheld did was look at all,</v>

1177
01:07:28.540 --> 01:07:31.900
<v Speaker 1>he didn't gas it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how big an effect size had to be for it</v>

1178
01:07:31.901 --> 01:07:34.570
<v Speaker 1>to be a big effect size.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What he did was go into the literature</v>

1179
01:07:34.571 --> 01:07:38.350
<v Speaker 1>and study a whole bunch of papers and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then empirically rank the effect sizes.</v>

1180
01:07:38.351 --> 01:07:41.770
<v Speaker 1>So that would be the standard deviation</v>
<v Speaker 1>difference or the correlation or the r</v>

1181
01:07:41.771 --> 01:07:44.860
<v Speaker 1>squared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can convert those and then decide</v>

1182
01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:47.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what proportion of papers had which</v>

1183
01:07:47.170 --> 01:07:50.650
<v Speaker 1>effect size and decide that well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could empirically rank them and then</v>

1184
01:07:50.651 --> 01:07:53.560
<v Speaker 1>you'd know how big your effect size was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what he found was that</v>

1185
01:07:55.570 --> 01:08:00.570
<v Speaker 1>about three percent of social science</v>
<v Speaker 1>studies showed a correlation Coefficient</v>

1186
01:08:00.911 --> 01:08:03.970
<v Speaker 1>of point five or above.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's about the correlation between</v>

1187
01:08:03.971 --> 01:08:08.971
<v Speaker 1>Iq and and general life success in</v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively complex conditions.</v>

1188
01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:10.840
<v Speaker 1>Point three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>

1189
01:08:10.841 --> 01:08:14.980
<v Speaker 1>two point five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only about one in four papers to one in</v>

1190
01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:16.971
<v Speaker 1>point one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>

1191
01:08:16.971 --> 01:08:18.020
<v Speaker 1>two point three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>

1192
01:08:18.290 --> 01:08:23.290
<v Speaker 1>25 to 57 percent of papers and then are</v>
<v Speaker 1>of less than point one five was about a</v>

1193
01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:27.770
<v Speaker 1>quarter of papers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what that means is the ability of Iq</v>

1194
01:08:27.771 --> 01:08:31.580
<v Speaker 1>to predict whatever it is that you want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to predict with it is way the hell up in</v>

1195
01:08:31.581 --> 01:08:33.230
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the rare,</v>

1196
01:08:33.350 --> 01:08:34.880
<v Speaker 1>rare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1197
01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:35.810
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>

1198
01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:40.270
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's up in the stratosphere with regards</v>

1199
01:08:40.271 --> 01:08:41.200
<v Speaker 1>to effect power.</v>

1200
01:08:44.130 --> 01:08:46.290
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what does it mean practically</v>

1201
01:08:46.291 --> 01:08:49.590
<v Speaker 1>speaking?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is from a company called the</v>

1202
01:08:49.591 --> 01:08:54.450
<v Speaker 1>wonderlic company and the wonderlic</v>
<v Speaker 1>wonderlic sales Iq tests to businesses</v>

1203
01:08:54.451 --> 01:08:57.750
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually illegal for businesses to</v>

1204
01:08:57.751 --> 01:09:02.310
<v Speaker 1>use Iq tests in the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So actually it's illegal to do anything</v>

1205
01:09:02.311 --> 01:09:04.620
<v Speaker 1>to hire employees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>employees in the United States as it</v>

1206
01:09:04.621 --> 01:09:07.050
<v Speaker 1>turns out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you have to use a test,</v>

1207
01:09:07.110 --> 01:09:11.550
<v Speaker 1>you have to use the tasks that's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most valid and reliable available that</v>

1208
01:09:11.551 --> 01:09:13.890
<v Speaker 1>doesn't produce any ethnic or gender</v>
<v Speaker 1>differences.</v>

1209
01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:15.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no test like that.</v>

1210
01:09:15.540 --> 01:09:16.710
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's illegal.</v>

1211
01:09:16.890 --> 01:09:18.420
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's illegal to use,</v>

1212
01:09:19.290 --> 01:09:20.940
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interviews.</v>

1213
01:09:20.941 --> 01:09:23.310
<v Speaker 1>It's illegal to use letters of</v>
<v Speaker 1>reference,</v>

1214
01:09:23.311 --> 01:09:27.120
<v Speaker 1>it's illegal to usability tests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might build to use conscientiousness</v>

1215
01:09:27.121 --> 01:09:32.121
<v Speaker 1>tests because conscientiousness tests do</v>
<v Speaker 1>seem to be completely free of</v>

1216
01:09:35.770 --> 01:09:38.980
<v Speaker 1>not exactly because older people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>more conscientious than younger people.</v>

1217
01:09:38.981 --> 01:09:41.230
<v Speaker 1>So that's also a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

1218
01:09:41.470 --> 01:09:42.191
<v Speaker 1>wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lick,</v>

1219
01:09:42.191 --> 01:09:44.170
<v Speaker 1>it's a good company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes really.</v>

1220
01:09:44.190 --> 01:09:49.000
<v Speaker 1>It's Iq tests are genuine tests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they are Iq tests and people do use</v>

1221
01:09:49.001 --> 01:09:50.890
<v Speaker 1>them in business even though they're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to,</v>

1222
01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:54.400
<v Speaker 1>but so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what they've done over over a long</v>

1223
01:09:54.700 --> 01:09:58.900
<v Speaker 1>period of using the test is to come up</v>
<v Speaker 1>with approximations for different forms</v>

1224
01:09:58.901 --> 01:10:03.190
<v Speaker 1>of employment opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how smart do you have to be in order</v>

1225
01:10:03.191 --> 01:10:04.024
<v Speaker 1>to be</v>

1226
01:10:05.330 --> 01:10:08.660
<v Speaker 1>placed in a given occupation with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable probability of success?</v>

1227
01:10:08.661 --> 01:10:10.100
<v Speaker 1>So we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can tell you here.</v>

1228
01:10:10.101 --> 01:10:10.934
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1229
01:10:12.350 --> 01:10:15.380
<v Speaker 1>let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You said exactly the right place.</v>

1230
01:10:21.140 --> 01:10:24.590
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you have iqs of 116 to 130,</v>

1231
01:10:24.770 --> 01:10:28.310
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty much you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I suspect there's a fair chunk</v>

1232
01:10:28.311 --> 01:10:33.311
<v Speaker 1>of you that have an Iq of over 130 130</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes you 115 makes you 15 percent.</v>

1233
01:10:35.540 --> 01:10:38.810
<v Speaker 1>One hundred and 30 makes you a 98</v>
<v Speaker 1>percentile.</v>

1234
01:10:39.110 --> 01:10:41.600
<v Speaker 1>One hundred and 45 makes you 99th</v>
<v Speaker 1>percentile.</v>

1235
01:10:41.601 --> 01:10:46.070
<v Speaker 1>One hundred and 60 makes you 99 point</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine percent or something else to think</v>

1236
01:10:46.071 --> 01:10:50.120
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Percentiles are strange things because</v>

1237
01:10:50.121 --> 01:10:52.610
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there's no difference between</v>

1238
01:10:52.611 --> 01:10:57.320
<v Speaker 1>someone who scores 95th percentile on an</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iq test and 99th percentile because it's</v>

1239
01:10:57.321 --> 01:11:00.590
<v Speaker 1>only four percentile is different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's not for percentages.</v>

1240
01:11:00.980 --> 01:11:03.440
<v Speaker 1>The person who scores Ninety five is one</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 20.</v>

1241
01:11:03.950 --> 01:11:06.910
<v Speaker 1>The person who scores 99 is one in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred.</v>

1242
01:11:07.130 --> 01:11:10.420
<v Speaker 1>The person who scores 99 point nine is</v>
<v Speaker 1>one in a thousand.</v>

1243
01:11:11.330 --> 01:11:12.380
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you might think,</v>

1244
01:11:12.381 --> 01:11:14.460
<v Speaker 1>well it doesn't matter because as you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1245
01:11:14.461 --> 01:11:17.760
<v Speaker 1>once you get to a certain degree of</v>
<v Speaker 1>smart that smart enough and now that's</v>

1246
01:11:17.761 --> 01:11:19.290
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

1247
01:11:19.291 --> 01:11:21.830
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably radically wrong in that</v>

1248
01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:26.670
<v Speaker 1>the differences between people actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>increase as you go up the Iq scale.</v>

1249
01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:29.970
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's because performance isn't</v>

1250
01:11:29.971 --> 01:11:33.120
<v Speaker 1>distributed in a normal distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's distributed in a prieto</v>

1251
01:11:33.121 --> 01:11:37.530
<v Speaker 1>distribution such that almost no one</v>
<v Speaker 1>does anything in a very small number of</v>

1252
01:11:37.531 --> 01:11:39.210
<v Speaker 1>people do everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1253
01:11:39.211 --> 01:11:42.180
<v Speaker 1>which is also a very dismal fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1254
01:11:42.181 --> 01:11:46.140
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're in the upper echelons of the,</v>

1255
01:11:46.380 --> 01:11:48.930
<v Speaker 1>of the cognitive distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

1256
01:11:54.660 --> 01:11:57.510
<v Speaker 1>from 116 to 130,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could be an attorney,</v>

1257
01:11:57.511 --> 01:12:00.360
<v Speaker 1>a research analyst and editor and</v>
<v Speaker 1>advertising manager,</v>

1258
01:12:00.361 --> 01:12:01.680
<v Speaker 1>a chemist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>engineer,</v>

1259
01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:03.780
<v Speaker 1>an executive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a manager,</v>

1260
01:12:03.781 --> 01:12:08.190
<v Speaker 1>a trade manager trainee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a systems analyst or an auditory from</v>

1261
01:12:08.191 --> 01:12:11.490
<v Speaker 1>115 to 110.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred and 10 to 115.</v>

1262
01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:12.593
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

1263
01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:16.430
<v Speaker 1>that'd be in the upper half of a high</v>
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>

1264
01:12:16.431 --> 01:12:18.260
<v Speaker 1>Graduating class,</v>

1270
01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:38.030
<v Speaker 1>hundred,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight to 103 administrative assistant</v>

1277
01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:53.480
<v Speaker 1>102 to 100.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's pretty much right at the mean</v>

1278
01:12:54.050 --> 01:12:56.840
<v Speaker 1>dispatcher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>General Office dispatcher,</v>

<v Speaker 1>general clerical work inside sales</v>

1281

<v Speaker 1>or an electrical helper</v>

1283

1287
01:13:24.260 --> 01:13:28.370
<v Speaker 1>mechanic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>medical dental assistant from 87 to 93</v>

1288
01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:29.780
<v Speaker 1>messenger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>factory,</v>

1289
01:13:29.781 --> 01:13:30.920
<v Speaker 1>production,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Assembler,</v>

1290
01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:33.080
<v Speaker 1>food service worker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nurses aid,</v>

1291
01:13:33.081 --> 01:13:34.430
<v Speaker 1>warehouseman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>custodian,</v>

1292
01:13:34.431 --> 01:13:37.610
<v Speaker 1>janitor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>material handler and packer.</v>

1293
01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:43.360
<v Speaker 1>And then that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you see that things are getting</v>

1294
01:13:44.401 --> 01:13:48.570
<v Speaker 1>pretty damn dismal for the people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>are have an Iq of 85 and below.</v>

1295
01:13:49.380 --> 01:13:54.380
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>now</v>

1296
01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:05.740
<v Speaker 1>what's the difference between intellect</v>
<v Speaker 1>and openness?</v>

1297
01:14:05.741 --> 01:14:07.270
<v Speaker 1>Proper?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1298
01:14:07.271 --> 01:14:11.530
<v Speaker 1>one difference is that men seem to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher intellect the trade and seem to</v>

1299
01:14:11.531 --> 01:14:15.490
<v Speaker 1>be higher in openness and openness seems</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be associated with verbal</v>

1300
01:14:15.491 --> 01:14:20.491
<v Speaker 1>intelligence and with imagination and</v>
<v Speaker 1>with fantasy and with aesthetic</v>

1301
01:14:20.951 --> 01:14:23.320
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it seems to go along with the fact</v>

1302
01:14:23.321 --> 01:14:27.340
<v Speaker 1>that women read more fiction than men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So men read nonfiction,</v>

1303
01:14:27.341 --> 01:14:29.080
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking in women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>read fiction,</v>

1304
01:14:29.081 --> 01:14:31.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's obviously there's a lot of overlap,</v>

1305
01:14:31.241 --> 01:14:34.240
<v Speaker 1>but fundamentally that seems to be how</v>
<v Speaker 1>it distributes.</v>

1306
01:14:34.241 --> 01:14:37.360
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's also partly because women</v>
<v Speaker 1>are more agreeable and so they're more</v>

1307
01:14:37.361 --> 01:14:40.130
<v Speaker 1>interested in human relations and</v>
<v Speaker 1>characters and you know,</v>

1308
01:14:40.210 --> 01:14:43.270
<v Speaker 1>that's the central,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the central theme of fiction.</v>

1309
01:14:46.010 --> 01:14:48.590
<v Speaker 1>People who are high in openness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think divergently.</v>

1310
01:14:48.770 --> 01:14:51.230
<v Speaker 1>Here we can do a quick little divergent</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking tests.</v>

1311
01:14:51.231 --> 01:14:54.620
<v Speaker 1>So why don't we do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take out a piece of paper and a pen and</v>

1312
01:14:54.621 --> 01:14:56.990
<v Speaker 1>a or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you can type on your computer.</v>

1313
01:14:56.991 --> 01:14:59.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can scratch it onto the desk for all</v>

1314
01:14:59.271 --> 01:15:02.600
<v Speaker 1>I care as long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but get out a piece of paper so you can</v>

1315
01:15:02.601 --> 01:15:03.710
<v Speaker 1>write on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we'll do this.</v>

1316
01:15:03.711 --> 01:15:07.590
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll only give you a minute since you're</v>

1317
01:15:07.610 --> 01:15:10.670
<v Speaker 1>all so fast and we only have six minutes</v>
<v Speaker 1>left.</v>

1318
01:15:11.630 --> 01:15:15.410
<v Speaker 1>So write down as many uses as you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>think of for a brick.</v>

1319
01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:20.500
<v Speaker 1>You have one minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1320
01:16:11.870 --> 01:16:13.320
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all the time you get.</v>

1321
01:16:13.340 --> 01:16:14.890
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first question is,</v>

1322
01:16:15.250 --> 01:16:17.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are going to point at you and you</v>

1323
01:16:17.681 --> 01:16:20.830
<v Speaker 1>can answer how many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many users did you come up with?</v>

1324
01:16:23.710 --> 01:16:26.770
<v Speaker 2>13.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Five.</v>

1325
01:16:28.690 --> 01:16:29.680
<v Speaker 2>Youtube?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1326
01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:30.533
<v Speaker 2>That's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eight,</v>

1327
01:16:32.290 --> 01:16:34.900
<v Speaker 2>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven.</v>

1328
01:16:35.570 --> 01:16:37.910
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did anybody come up with more than 13?</v>

1329
01:16:39.270 --> 01:16:40.103
<v Speaker 2>How many?</v>

1330
01:16:40.820 --> 01:16:43.340
<v Speaker 1>14 did anybody come up with?</v>
<v Speaker 1>More than 14.</v>

1331
01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:46.460
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you two are the most idiation Lee</v>

1332
01:16:46.461 --> 01:16:50.690
<v Speaker 1>fluent people in the class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And fluency is a matter of the rip</v>

1333
01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:54.200
<v Speaker 1>rapidity with which you can generate</v>
<v Speaker 1>exemplars from a category.</v>

1334
01:16:54.620 --> 01:16:58.070
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that we might ask</v>
<v Speaker 1>just as much would be how many words can</v>

1335
01:16:58.071 --> 01:17:00.110
<v Speaker 1>you write the begin with the letter ass</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a minute.</v>

1336
01:17:00.650 --> 01:17:02.600
<v Speaker 1>And there'll be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't believe the bloody range of</v>

1337
01:17:02.601 --> 01:17:04.160
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There'll be people will be people who</v>

1338
01:17:04.161 --> 01:17:06.050
<v Speaker 1>get six and there'll be people who get</v>
<v Speaker 1>50,</v>

1339
01:17:06.610 --> 01:17:09.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so idiation will fluency is actually</v>

1340
01:17:09.030 --> 01:17:11.240
<v Speaker 1>pretty decent predictor of creative</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability.</v>

1341
01:17:11.510 --> 01:17:12.950
<v Speaker 1>Now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not a great test,</v>

1342
01:17:12.951 --> 01:17:15.290
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it was very short and I do that</v>

1343
01:17:15.291 --> 01:17:18.930
<v Speaker 1>multiple times with multiple time</v>
<v Speaker 1>durations and different exemplars in</v>

1344
01:17:18.931 --> 01:17:21.700
<v Speaker 1>some across that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the correlation between the ideation</v>

1345
01:17:21.701 --> 01:17:24.620
<v Speaker 1>of fluency in longterm creative</v>
<v Speaker 1>achievement is about point three.</v>

1346
01:17:24.850 --> 01:17:26.180
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty major.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1347
01:17:26.181 --> 01:17:28.430
<v Speaker 1>So let's hear a use for a brick.</v>

1348
01:17:29.580 --> 01:17:30.413
<v Speaker 2>How about you?</v>

1349
01:17:33.950 --> 01:17:35.530
<v Speaker 1>You can draw on the sidewalk with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>brick.</v>

1350
01:17:35.890 --> 01:17:39.250
<v Speaker 1>You a paper weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many people got paperweight?</v>

1351
01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:42.190
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a low creative response.</v>

1352
01:17:42.460 --> 01:17:44.500
<v Speaker 1>Now why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean that all your</v>

1353
01:17:44.501 --> 01:17:47.200
<v Speaker 1>responses are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a technical definition,</v>

1354
01:17:47.710 --> 01:17:49.870
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's what makes a response low</v>

1355
01:17:49.871 --> 01:17:52.060
<v Speaker 1>creative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone has it.</v>

1356
01:17:52.330 --> 01:17:54.250
<v Speaker 1>Now it's a perfectly reasonable</v>
<v Speaker 1>response.</v>

1357
01:17:54.460 --> 01:17:57.340
<v Speaker 1>But for it to be creative virtually by</v>
<v Speaker 1>definition,</v>

1358
01:17:57.341 --> 01:18:02.110
<v Speaker 1>it has to be a low probability response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That actually makes sense.</v>

1359
01:18:02.260 --> 01:18:04.220
<v Speaker 1>So draw on sidewalk is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

1360
01:18:04.390 --> 01:18:07.120
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is more low probability response.</v>

1361
01:18:07.690 --> 01:18:12.690
<v Speaker 1>Somebody got a weird use for a brick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

1362
01:18:13.980 --> 01:18:15.000
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

1363
01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:18.180
<v Speaker 1>Anybody else have that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They ground their brick into dust for</v>

1364
01:18:18.181 --> 01:18:19.260
<v Speaker 1>something?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No?</v>

1365
01:18:19.770 --> 01:18:23.220
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could kill someone with a brick.</v>

1366
01:18:23.221 --> 01:18:25.140
<v Speaker 1>Anybody have that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1367
01:18:25.290 --> 01:18:27.510
<v Speaker 1>Low agreeableness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Low creativity.</v>

1368
01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:29.611
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1369
01:18:29.611 --> 01:18:30.370
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we'll go.</v>

1370
01:18:30.370 --> 01:18:32.790
<v Speaker 1>Anybody else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go to like a peculiar one for a brick</v>

1371
01:18:32.850 --> 01:18:33.683
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

1372
01:18:35.440 --> 01:18:36.273
<v Speaker 2>Look.</v>

1373
01:18:36.750 --> 01:18:38.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody else have that?</v>

1374
01:18:39.300 --> 01:18:39.931
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1375
01:18:39.931 --> 01:18:40.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1376
01:18:40.350 --> 01:18:43.590
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of a lousy musical instrument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in a pinch it would work.</v>

1377
01:18:43.770 --> 01:18:47.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a good one.</v>

1378
01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:49.950
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can kill it and then you can drown</v>

1379
01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:51.110
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1380
01:18:51.430 --> 01:18:53.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the way you would score this,</v>

1381
01:18:53.341 --> 01:18:54.870
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's quite straight.</v>

1382
01:18:54.930 --> 01:18:56.820
<v Speaker 1>It's not that straightforward actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

1383
01:18:56.821 --> 01:19:01.350
<v Speaker 1>you count the number of responses and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get rid of ones that are repetitive</v>

1384
01:19:01.710 --> 01:19:04.950
<v Speaker 1>and then you also get usually a couple</v>
<v Speaker 1>of people to throw the ones that are</v>

1385
01:19:04.951 --> 01:19:08.400
<v Speaker 1>just like they're neither original nor</v>
<v Speaker 1>practical.</v>

1386
01:19:08.820 --> 01:19:11.160
<v Speaker 1>The best responses are original and</v>
<v Speaker 1>practical.</v>

1387
01:19:11.161 --> 01:19:12.930
<v Speaker 1>Now there's a bit of a judgment call</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

1388
01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:15.450
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you get a number of people to do</v>

1389
01:19:15.451 --> 01:19:17.330
<v Speaker 1>the rating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get pretty decent interrater</v>

1390
01:19:17.340 --> 01:19:21.120
<v Speaker 1>reliability and so then you score</v>
<v Speaker 1>originality and the way you score</v>

1391
01:19:21.121 --> 01:19:26.121
<v Speaker 1>originality is merely by something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>listing all the responses and then</v>

1392
01:19:27.481 --> 01:19:31.200
<v Speaker 1>calculating how probable or frequent the</v>
<v Speaker 1>responses are in the more infrequent</v>

1393
01:19:31.201 --> 01:19:32.940
<v Speaker 1>responses you get a higher score for.</v>

1394
01:19:33.180 --> 01:19:35.640
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's basically a population,</v>

1395
01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:37.320
<v Speaker 1>a sample.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1396
01:19:37.830 --> 01:19:41.130
<v Speaker 1>And those things actually work those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those tests.</v>

1397
01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:44.340
<v Speaker 1>Just so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I'll stop with this.</v>

1398
01:19:44.341 --> 01:19:48.570
<v Speaker 1>This is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a measure that I derived with</v>

1399
01:19:48.571 --> 01:19:50.880
<v Speaker 1>one of my students when I worked in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boston,</v>

1400
01:19:50.881 --> 01:19:54.420
<v Speaker 1>her name was Shelly Carson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this thing is actually become one of</v>

1401
01:19:54.421 --> 01:19:57.900
<v Speaker 1>the standard measures of creativity in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the creativity literature,</v>

1402
01:19:57.901 --> 01:20:01.860
<v Speaker 1>which is quite fun and it's creative</v>
<v Speaker 1>achievement questionnaire.</v>

1403
01:20:01.861 --> 01:20:04.830
<v Speaker 1>So what I gave you just now is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>creativity test.</v>

1404
01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:09.240
<v Speaker 1>It's one of many creativity test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a creative achievement test</v>

1405
01:20:09.241 --> 01:20:12.840
<v Speaker 1>because you can generate uses for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>brick without running out and becoming a</v>

1406
01:20:12.841 --> 01:20:14.350
<v Speaker 1>brick entrepreneur,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1407
01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:18.630
<v Speaker 1>so there's a difference between being</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to think divergently and with loose</v>

1408
01:20:18.631 --> 01:20:22.740
<v Speaker 1>associations and then also being able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>put that into practice so you achieve</v>

1409
01:20:22.741 --> 01:20:24.690
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so here's some levels of</v>

1410
01:20:24.691 --> 01:20:25.524
<v Speaker 1>achievement.</v>

1411
01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:27.780
<v Speaker 1>So there's the scientific discovery</v>
<v Speaker 1>domain.</v>

1412
01:20:28.470 --> 01:20:31.200
<v Speaker 1>I do not have training or recognized</v>
<v Speaker 1>stability in this field.</v>

1413
01:20:31.201 --> 01:20:34.230
<v Speaker 1>I often think about ways that scientific</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems could be solved.</v>

1414
01:20:34.410 --> 01:20:37.530
<v Speaker 1>I have won a prize at a science fair or</v>
<v Speaker 1>other local competition.</v>

1415
01:20:37.740 --> 01:20:41.220
<v Speaker 1>I've received a scholarship based on my</v>
<v Speaker 1>work in science or medicine.</v>

1416
01:20:41.460 --> 01:20:44.610
<v Speaker 1>I've been arthur or core author of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>study published in the scientific</v>

1417
01:20:44.611 --> 01:20:46.750
<v Speaker 1>journal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've won a national prize.</v>

1418
01:20:46.751 --> 01:20:49.620
<v Speaker 1>I've received a grant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my work has been cited by other</v>

1419
01:20:49.621 --> 01:20:52.590
<v Speaker 1>scientists in national publications.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1420
01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:56.760
<v Speaker 1>And then the same thing for say theater</v>
<v Speaker 1>and film and Culinary Arts.</v>

1421
01:20:56.790 --> 01:21:00.540
<v Speaker 1>Zero is I do not have training or</v>
<v Speaker 1>recognized stability in theater and</v>

1422
01:21:00.541 --> 01:21:02.730
<v Speaker 1>film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number seven is my theatrical work has</v>

1423
01:21:02.731 --> 01:21:06.150
<v Speaker 1>been recognized in a national</v>
<v Speaker 1>publication for culinary arts.</v>

1424
01:21:06.151 --> 01:21:10.380
<v Speaker 1>I do not have training or experience and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the highest one is my recipes have been</v>

1425
01:21:10.381 --> 01:21:12.030
<v Speaker 1>published nationally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1426
01:21:12.031 --> 01:21:16.890
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's 13 different domains</v>

1427
01:21:22.690 --> 01:21:26.170
<v Speaker 1>and that's the distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not normally distributed.</v>

1428
01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:31.800
<v Speaker 1>So what you see there actually it's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite right because the the median</v>

1429
01:21:32.671 --> 01:21:35.560
<v Speaker 1>answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about 66 percent of the respondents</v>

1430
01:21:35.561 --> 01:21:38.020
<v Speaker 1>to the creative achievement</v>
<v Speaker 1>questionnaire have a median score of</v>

1431
01:21:38.021 --> 01:21:40.060
<v Speaker 1>zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1432
01:21:40.660 --> 01:21:43.570
<v Speaker 1>Zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do not have training or talent in</v>

1433
01:21:43.571 --> 01:21:48.210
<v Speaker 1>any of the 13 areas and then there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people who are way out on the right</v>

1434
01:21:48.211 --> 01:21:49.270
<v Speaker 1>hand distribution</v>

1435
01:21:51.050 --> 01:21:52.700
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can imagine that once you have</v>

1436
01:21:52.701 --> 01:21:55.190
<v Speaker 1>national exposure in one magazine as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>writer,</v>

1437
01:21:55.191 --> 01:21:58.640
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you're going to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>national exposure again for your second</v>

1438
01:21:58.641 --> 01:22:00.920
<v Speaker 1>novel starts to go up pretty damn high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1439
01:22:01.220 --> 01:22:05.150
<v Speaker 1>And so you get this terrible step down</v>
<v Speaker 1>function so that almost everybody</v>

1440
01:22:06.020 --> 01:22:09.740
<v Speaker 1>aggregates that nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then a few people are way out in the</v>

1441
01:22:09.741 --> 01:22:13.160
<v Speaker 1>distribution and they just get</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything and there's actually a law,</v>

1442
01:22:13.490 --> 01:22:16.850
<v Speaker 1>it's called the matthew principle that</v>
<v Speaker 1>economists use and it's from a statement</v>

1443
01:22:16.851 --> 01:22:21.851
<v Speaker 1>in the New Testament from matthew and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a statement where Christ says from</v>

1444
01:22:23.181 --> 01:22:27.770
<v Speaker 1>those who have to those who have</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything more will be given and from</v>

1445
01:22:27.771 --> 01:22:29.990
<v Speaker 1>those who have nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything will be taken away.</v>

1446
01:22:30.290 --> 01:22:34.310
<v Speaker 1>And that seems to be how creative</v>
<v Speaker 1>resources are distributed in the</v>

1447
01:22:34.311 --> 01:22:39.050
<v Speaker 1>population and to a large degree that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>dependent on intelligence,</v>

1448
01:22:39.590 --> 01:22:43.100
<v Speaker 1>openness and conscientiousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1449
01:22:45.620 --> 01:22:50.620
<v Speaker 1>you can understand why none of that very</v>
<v Speaker 1>popular with people since you're all</v>

1450
01:22:51.771 --> 01:22:54.350
<v Speaker 1>smart and conscientious though it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to work out well for you.</v>

1451
01:22:55.910 --> 01:23:00.910
<v Speaker 1>See you on Tuesday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to post your mid term marks.</v>

1452
01:23:05.180 --> 01:23:08.390
<v Speaker 1>What we're going to do after that with</v>
<v Speaker 1>regards to the strike,</v>

1453
01:23:08.391 --> 01:23:09.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>

1454
01:23:09.950 --> 01:23:10.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't know yet.</v>
