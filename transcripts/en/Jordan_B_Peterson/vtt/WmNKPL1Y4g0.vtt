1
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.620
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hi</v>

2
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.230
<v Speaker 1>guys and girls and interested others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So on October 18th,</v>

3
00:01:08.941 --> 00:01:12.600
<v Speaker 1>I received a letter from the University</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Toronto asking for my silence with</v>

4
00:01:12.601 --> 00:01:17.601
<v Speaker 1>regards to what I've been discussing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On September 27th,</v>

5
00:01:18.361 --> 00:01:20.670
<v Speaker 1>I made a video I called fear and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>law,</v>

6
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.030
<v Speaker 1>which was a discussion of what I believe</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be a set of particularly insidious</v>

7
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.260
<v Speaker 1>legislative moves on the part of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>provincial and federal governments in</v>

8
00:01:31.261 --> 00:01:35.370
<v Speaker 1>Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm laying the groundwork for requiring</v>

9
00:01:35.371 --> 00:01:37.650
<v Speaker 1>a certain kind of compulsory speech</v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

10
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.680
<v Speaker 1>from the citizens of Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I commented in that video that I</v>

11
00:01:42.841 --> 00:01:46.440
<v Speaker 1>believed that the act of making the</v>
<v Speaker 1>video itself and discussing the issues</v>

12
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.240
<v Speaker 1>that are relevant to that legislation</v>
<v Speaker 1>was probably illegal.</v>

13
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm on October third.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made another video decrying the</v>

14
00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.250
<v Speaker 1>University of Toronto Human Resources</v>
<v Speaker 1>Departments,</v>

15
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.250
<v Speaker 1>recent decision to make anti racism and</v>
<v Speaker 1>anti bias training mandatory partly as a</v>

16
00:02:06.811 --> 00:02:10.560
<v Speaker 1>consequence of their interactions with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>group called the black liberation</v>

17
00:02:10.561 --> 00:02:11.610
<v Speaker 1>collective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

18
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a particularly savory group to</v>
<v Speaker 1>say the least.</v>

19
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.300
<v Speaker 1>And then on October fifth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did another video by recorded another</v>

20
00:02:21.301 --> 00:02:23.730
<v Speaker 1>video laying out what I described the PC</v>
<v Speaker 1>game,</v>

21
00:02:23.731 --> 00:02:25.000
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

22
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an ideologically motivated victimization</v>

23
00:02:29.521 --> 00:02:34.521
<v Speaker 1>slash perpetrator game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I outlined some counter tactics in</v>

24
00:02:34.651 --> 00:02:37.530
<v Speaker 1>those videos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said that discussion of gender issues</v>

25
00:02:37.531 --> 00:02:39.900
<v Speaker 1>has probably become illegal now in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada,</v>

26
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.680
<v Speaker 1>maybe even a hate crime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm one of the consequences of that was</v>

27
00:02:43.681 --> 00:02:48.681
<v Speaker 1>a number of lawyers wrote articles</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying that I was just scaremongering</v>

28
00:02:48.781 --> 00:02:53.640
<v Speaker 1>and that bill [inaudible] for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have that intent.</v>

29
00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.570
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say precisely that bill</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] had that intent,</v>

30
00:02:57.571 --> 00:02:59.680
<v Speaker 1>although I believe it opens the door to</v>
<v Speaker 1>such things.</v>

31
00:02:59.681 --> 00:03:04.681
<v Speaker 1>But I did say that the surrounding</v>
<v Speaker 1>policy discussions on the Ontario Human</v>

32
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.670
<v Speaker 1>Rights Commission,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not a good place,</v>

33
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.920
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>indicated that,</v>

34
00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.600
<v Speaker 1>that it probably had become illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say the fact that the</v>

35
00:03:13.601 --> 00:03:15.460
<v Speaker 1>university has now written me two</v>
<v Speaker 1>letters,</v>

36
00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:18.280
<v Speaker 1>suggesting that in fact what I was doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>was illegal.</v>

37
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.270
<v Speaker 1>Makes my argument better than any but a</v>
<v Speaker 1>better than anything I could do.</v>

38
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.730
<v Speaker 1>I also said that biological sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gender identity and gender expression do</v>

39
00:03:27.731 --> 00:03:31.420
<v Speaker 1>not vary independently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they don't vary independently by the</v>

40
00:03:31.421 --> 00:03:33.880
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though that's become axiomatic in</v>

41
00:03:33.881 --> 00:03:36.790
<v Speaker 1>the underlying legislation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they don't vary independently</v>

42
00:03:36.791 --> 00:03:41.791
<v Speaker 1>because the overwhelming majority of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have a gender expression,</v>

43
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.280
<v Speaker 1>gender identity and biological sex that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are the same in that 98 percent of</v>

44
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.460
<v Speaker 1>biological males identify as male and</v>
<v Speaker 1>dress as males.</v>

45
00:03:51.461 --> 00:03:56.461
<v Speaker 1>And the same is true of females.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they don't vary independently.</v>

46
00:03:56.711 --> 00:04:00.820
<v Speaker 1>People confuse that with me saying that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were no such thing as say</v>

47
00:04:00.821 --> 00:04:04.750
<v Speaker 1>nonbinary people or transgender people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I never said that,</v>

48
00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.180
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't really matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently.</v>

49
00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.750
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my fundamental concern was that we are</v>

50
00:04:10.751 --> 00:04:14.860
<v Speaker 1>now legally required to use an approved</v>
<v Speaker 1>language when speaking and when speaking</v>

51
00:04:14.861 --> 00:04:18.310
<v Speaker 1>about fundamental issues like gender and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's very few issues,</v>

52
00:04:18.311 --> 00:04:19.480
<v Speaker 1>more fundamental than gender.</v>

53
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.680
<v Speaker 1>And I said that I wouldn't do it because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is a very dangerous requirement.</v>

54
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:29.190
<v Speaker 1>It's the first time that I can tell</v>
<v Speaker 1>where instead of restrictions on free</v>

55
00:04:29.471 --> 00:04:33.850
<v Speaker 1>speech being of the sort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there are things you can't say say</v>

56
00:04:33.851 --> 00:04:36.910
<v Speaker 1>hate crime things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not an advocate of hate crime</v>

57
00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.230
<v Speaker 1>laws,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

58
00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.270
<v Speaker 1>hate crime speech laws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're dangerous.</v>

59
00:04:40.271 --> 00:04:42.460
<v Speaker 1>But in any case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can understand why people think</v>

60
00:04:42.461 --> 00:04:45.640
<v Speaker 1>they're necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this law requires us to use a</v>

61
00:04:45.641 --> 00:04:49.690
<v Speaker 1>certain kind of approved language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought that that was a line we</v>

62
00:04:49.691 --> 00:04:53.590
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't cross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also said I wouldn't mouth the words</v>

63
00:04:53.591 --> 00:04:57.040
<v Speaker 1>of the ideologically possessed and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was with regards to gender neutral</v>

64
00:04:57.041 --> 00:05:01.390
<v Speaker 1>pronouns because those pronouns which</v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't passed into common usage by the</v>

65
00:05:01.391 --> 00:05:03.130
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're very awkward and not</v>

66
00:05:03.131 --> 00:05:06.730
<v Speaker 1>well crafted to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're words that have been produced by</v>

67
00:05:06.731 --> 00:05:11.731
<v Speaker 1>a certain kind of radical left wing</v>
<v Speaker 1>activist radical egalitarianism whose</v>

68
00:05:12.401 --> 00:05:17.401
<v Speaker 1>ideology I regard as perhaps posing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most serious threat to the freedom of</v>

69
00:05:17.711 --> 00:05:19.420
<v Speaker 1>the West that currently exists.</v>

70
00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.860
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm not going to use their words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said that free speech is in</v>

71
00:05:23.861 --> 00:05:27.820
<v Speaker 1>serious danger in Canada because of an</v>
<v Speaker 1>onslaught of radical leftist ideology.</v>

72
00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.370
<v Speaker 1>So that was basically my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

73
00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.080
<v Speaker 1>my claims.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

74
00:05:33.081 --> 00:05:35.590
<v Speaker 1>I got a warning letter from Suzanne</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ferber,</v>

75
00:05:35.591 --> 00:05:39.610
<v Speaker 1>chair of the psychology department.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a in the background,</v>

76
00:05:39.611 --> 00:05:42.130
<v Speaker 1>David Cameron,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dean of the Faculty of Arts and science.</v>

77
00:05:42.131 --> 00:05:44.320
<v Speaker 1>Cheryl [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>vice president,</v>

78
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.720
<v Speaker 1>provost and Kelly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hannah Moffat,</v>

79
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.660
<v Speaker 1>vp hr and equity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The person by the way,</v>

80
00:05:49.661 --> 00:05:54.661
<v Speaker 1>who's now responsible for the mandatory</v>
<v Speaker 1>anti racism and anti-biased training</v>

81
00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:59.540
<v Speaker 1>initiatives at the University of Toronto</v>
<v Speaker 1>and who has refused to disavow her</v>

82
00:05:59.541 --> 00:06:02.300
<v Speaker 1>department's Association with the Black</v>
<v Speaker 1>Liberation Collective,</v>

83
00:06:02.301 --> 00:06:07.301
<v Speaker 1>despite the fact that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will not disavow violence in the</v>

84
00:06:07.371 --> 00:06:11.810
<v Speaker 1>pursuit of their aims.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in spite of the fact that two of the</v>

85
00:06:11.811 --> 00:06:14.630
<v Speaker 1>people who produce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who organized that particular</v>

86
00:06:14.631 --> 00:06:17.870
<v Speaker 1>organization have a history of</v>
<v Speaker 1>misbehavior to put it,</v>

87
00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:20.990
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to put it mildly.</v>

88
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:26.600
<v Speaker 1>The letter said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the initial initial letter said that,</v>

89
00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:31.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean to me did not recognize the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rights of others to tell me which</v>

90
00:06:31.251 --> 00:06:33.260
<v Speaker 1>personal pronoun to use when addressing</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

91
00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.440
<v Speaker 1>And yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is something I do not recognize.</v>

92
00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:38.870
<v Speaker 1>It.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do not recognize the rights of others to</v>

93
00:06:38.871 --> 00:06:41.780
<v Speaker 1>tell anyone which personal pronoun to</v>
<v Speaker 1>use when addressing them.</v>

94
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:46.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm standing by that the UFT said that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was required to acceptance of their</v>

95
00:06:47.211 --> 00:06:50.660
<v Speaker 1>statutorily protected right to equality</v>
<v Speaker 1>and equal treatment.</v>

96
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:54.350
<v Speaker 1>So now my failure to use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

97
00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:59.000
<v Speaker 1>preferred pronouns like Zi answer or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever pronouns people want for that</v>

98
00:06:59.001 --> 00:07:00.440
<v Speaker 1>matter is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

99
00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:05.180
<v Speaker 1>is transgressing against their rights in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

100
00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:07.730
<v Speaker 1>in a manner that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that appears to contravene the</v>

101
00:07:07.731 --> 00:07:10.400
<v Speaker 1>legislation that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's interesting that the</v>

102
00:07:10.401 --> 00:07:12.140
<v Speaker 1>university warned me of that because of</v>
<v Speaker 1>course,</v>

103
00:07:12.141 --> 00:07:14.000
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly why I made the video to</v>
<v Speaker 1>begin with.</v>

104
00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.090
<v Speaker 1>The letter also said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do not accept that gender</v>

105
00:07:17.091 --> 00:07:19.730
<v Speaker 1>identification can be independent of</v>
<v Speaker 1>biological sex.</v>

106
00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:22.370
<v Speaker 1>The UFT said that was discriminatory as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

107
00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:25.620
<v Speaker 1>I did not say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I informed the UFT that their letter</v>

108
00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:30.650
<v Speaker 1>did not do a good job of actually I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>accusing me if they didn't accuse me</v>

109
00:07:30.651 --> 00:07:31.850
<v Speaker 1>properly of what I said.</v>

110
00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:34.730
<v Speaker 1>And I offered to give them the letter</v>
<v Speaker 1>back so that they could write it</v>

111
00:07:34.731 --> 00:07:36.260
<v Speaker 1>properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they refused.</v>

112
00:07:36.261 --> 00:07:37.720
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

113
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:40.430
<v Speaker 1>then it stands the way it stands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

114
00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:44.090
<v Speaker 1>but we won't talk about that letter too</v>
<v Speaker 1>much because we muzzled talk about the</v>

115
00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.530
<v Speaker 1>newer one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the consequences of,</v>

116
00:07:47.531 --> 00:07:50.420
<v Speaker 1>of what I did were crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

117
00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:52.970
<v Speaker 1>There were two demonstrations at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>University of Toronto.</v>

118
00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:55.070
<v Speaker 1>The second one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was the free speech.</v>

119
00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:59.030
<v Speaker 1>The first one was our demonstration</v>
<v Speaker 1>against me personally,</v>

120
00:07:59.031 --> 00:08:00.690
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

121
00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:04.100
<v Speaker 1>because of what I had dared to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the second one was a free speech</v>

122
00:08:04.101 --> 00:08:07.160
<v Speaker 1>rally that was organized by students.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have nothing to do with it except that</v>

123
00:08:07.161 --> 00:08:09.260
<v Speaker 1>I came to speak at it as did lauren</v>
<v Speaker 1>southern,</v>

124
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:14.030
<v Speaker 1>who's a journalist for rebel media that</v>
<v Speaker 1>has obtained massive online and youtube</v>

125
00:08:14.031 --> 00:08:16.940
<v Speaker 1>coverage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because lauren southern was the</v>

126
00:08:16.941 --> 00:08:20.450
<v Speaker 1>victim of what appears to be an assault</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the free speech rally.</v>

127
00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:23.840
<v Speaker 1>And that has now been viewed by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would think several million people.</v>

128
00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:28.730
<v Speaker 1>It got what I did go mass and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>demonstrations and all of that got</v>

129
00:08:28.731 --> 00:08:31.100
<v Speaker 1>massive traditional media coverage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

130
00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:34.820
<v Speaker 1>the national,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the national radio in Canada,</v>

131
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:36.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

132
00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:38.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>national TV,</v>

133
00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:41.780
<v Speaker 1>all our major stations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a huge number of newspapers,</v>

134
00:08:41.781 --> 00:08:44.170
<v Speaker 1>columns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>op-eds,</v>

135
00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:47.210
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's been one of the biggest stories</v>

136
00:08:47.211 --> 00:08:49.280
<v Speaker 1>in Canada for the last 10 days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

137
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:53.040
<v Speaker 1>and massive online coverage as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

138
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:55.830
<v Speaker 1>and so I think the reason for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

139
00:08:55.831 --> 00:08:58.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just sat in my office and made a video</v>

140
00:08:58.741 --> 00:09:01.530
<v Speaker 1>about bill [inaudible] and complained</v>
<v Speaker 1>about political correctness,</v>

141
00:09:01.531 --> 00:09:03.810
<v Speaker 1>but I did something different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see in this is what I think the</v>

142
00:09:03.811 --> 00:09:06.120
<v Speaker 1>difference is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that people complain a lot about</v>

143
00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:10.980
<v Speaker 1>political correctness but they never get</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tire to hit the road or are they</v>

144
00:09:10.981 --> 00:09:12.960
<v Speaker 1>never hit the nail on the head with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hammer.</v>

145
00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:15.540
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I did was I said I don't like</v>

146
00:09:15.541 --> 00:09:18.600
<v Speaker 1>political correctness and here's</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that I'm being required to do</v>

147
00:09:18.601 --> 00:09:21.450
<v Speaker 1>by politically correct people and I will</v>
<v Speaker 1>not do it.</v>

148
00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:22.830
<v Speaker 1>I won't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>

149
00:09:22.831 --> 00:09:27.831
<v Speaker 1>And I stand by that I am not going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>use made up pronouns to refer to people</v>

150
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:31.890
<v Speaker 1>if we sort this out linguistically in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next 20 years.</v>

151
00:09:31.891 --> 00:09:34.980
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we spontaneously come up with a term</v>

152
00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:39.660
<v Speaker 1>that solves some of the problems with</v>
<v Speaker 1>gendered pronouns that perhaps we have.</v>

153
00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:45.500
<v Speaker 1>Although I'm not convinced that we have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if a spontaneous and I'm a and</v>

154
00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:52.260
<v Speaker 1>consensus oriented decision is made</v>
<v Speaker 1>around the use of a new term,</v>

155
00:09:52.261 --> 00:09:55.420
<v Speaker 1>then I'm willing to adopt it as well as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>

156
00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:59.250
<v Speaker 1>as much as the next person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm not having it forced on me and I</v>

157
00:09:59.251 --> 00:10:02.490
<v Speaker 1>don't think anyone else should and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>not using the damn made up words by</v>

158
00:10:02.491 --> 00:10:04.860
<v Speaker 1>radical left wing activists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that stopped.</v>

159
00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:09.600
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also got two letters from the</v>

160
00:10:09.601 --> 00:10:14.310
<v Speaker 1>university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the first letter said you believe</v>

161
00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:16.860
<v Speaker 1>that some of your commentary may be</v>
<v Speaker 1>illegal.</v>

162
00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:18.690
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that that's why I made the</v>

163
00:10:18.691 --> 00:10:21.350
<v Speaker 1>video because I don't think that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of things that I was saying should</v>

164
00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:24.420
<v Speaker 1>be illegal in a free society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's unbelievably dangerous and</v>

165
00:10:24.421 --> 00:10:26.520
<v Speaker 1>short sighted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The letter said,</v>

166
00:10:26.521 --> 00:10:30.360
<v Speaker 1>I must comply with the law including the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ontario Human Rights Code.</v>

167
00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:33.090
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I must consider the impact of my</v>

168
00:10:33.091 --> 00:10:35.160
<v Speaker 1>words and actions on my students and</v>
<v Speaker 1>colleagues.</v>

169
00:10:35.161 --> 00:10:38.370
<v Speaker 1>While let me tell you this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I considered the impact of my words and</v>

170
00:10:38.371 --> 00:10:41.640
<v Speaker 1>actions on my students and colleagues</v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily carefully.</v>

171
00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:43.050
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might say,</v>

172
00:10:43.051 --> 00:10:45.240
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I considered the impact of my words and</v>

173
00:10:45.241 --> 00:10:48.540
<v Speaker 1>our actions far more carefully than did</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people who wrote these letters,</v>

174
00:10:48.541 --> 00:10:50.400
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to explain why I believe</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

175
00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:56.240
<v Speaker 1>So the second letter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which actually requested my silence,</v>

176
00:10:56.241 --> 00:10:59.000
<v Speaker 1>the first one was more of a warning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was signed by David Cameron,</v>

177
00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:01.790
<v Speaker 1>dean of the Faculty of Arts and science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and see a Ben Nelson,</v>

178
00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.310
<v Speaker 1>vice president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>faculty and academic life.</v>

179
00:11:04.311 --> 00:11:07.460
<v Speaker 1>And I read it in the previous video so</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can help post it as well,</v>

180
00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:11.060
<v Speaker 1>so you can look at the details,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to go over it more or less</v>

181
00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:13.790
<v Speaker 1>topic by topic now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to analyze it.</v>

182
00:11:13.791 --> 00:11:16.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to deconstruct it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you might think for all you</v>

183
00:11:16.401 --> 00:11:19.830
<v Speaker 1>postmodernists out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's an example of deconstruction in</v>

184
00:11:19.831 --> 00:11:22.040
<v Speaker 1>action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

185
00:11:22.041 --> 00:11:25.520
<v Speaker 1>So the first part of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

186
00:11:25.521 --> 00:11:29.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>letter detailed out essentially what the</v>

187
00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:32.750
<v Speaker 1>University of Toronto understands to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>my comments and,</v>

188
00:11:32.751 --> 00:11:35.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the complaints the UFT has received.</v>

189
00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:41.410
<v Speaker 1>Then the ut are outline their</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothetical commitment to free speech.</v>

190
00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:46.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about my refusal to use</v>
<v Speaker 1>gender neutral pronouns.</v>

191
00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:49.440
<v Speaker 1>Describe that refusal as illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

192
00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:56.800
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the letter first details out my</v>

193
00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:03.990
<v Speaker 1>comments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

194
00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:06.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>discusses the fact that I made these</v>

195
00:12:06.601 --> 00:12:09.900
<v Speaker 1>videos and then the states that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

196
00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:16.240
<v Speaker 1>there are ongoing concerns about those</v>
<v Speaker 1>videos that have been expressed by a</v>

197
00:12:16.241 --> 00:12:18.940
<v Speaker 1>variety of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of groups and individuals at the</v>

198
00:12:18.941 --> 00:12:21.370
<v Speaker 1>university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next part of the letter,</v>

199
00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.820
<v Speaker 1>at least in principle details the</v>
<v Speaker 1>University of Toronto's commitment to</v>

200
00:12:24.821 --> 00:12:27.850
<v Speaker 1>free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I found this interesting and rather</v>

201
00:12:27.851 --> 00:12:30.400
<v Speaker 1>orwellian way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>George Orwell of course,</v>

202
00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:35.830
<v Speaker 1>discussed the use of something he called</v>
<v Speaker 1>doublespeak,</v>

203
00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:39.770
<v Speaker 1>which is to say one thing and mean</v>
<v Speaker 1>another or maybe mean precise out there.</v>

204
00:12:39.771 --> 00:12:43.630
<v Speaker 1>So in the letter that the second thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the University of Toronto does it stress</v>

205
00:12:43.631 --> 00:12:46.480
<v Speaker 1>that it has a commitment to free speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then of course,</v>

206
00:12:46.481 --> 00:12:50.830
<v Speaker 1>later in the letter it decides that that</v>
<v Speaker 1>does not extend to its professor's</v>

207
00:12:50.831 --> 00:12:54.040
<v Speaker 1>choosing their own pronouns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can decide for yourself how deep</v>

208
00:12:54.041 --> 00:12:56.100
<v Speaker 1>that commitment goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

209
00:12:57.130 --> 00:13:01.870
<v Speaker 1>then they discussed that my refusal to</v>
<v Speaker 1>use gender neutral pronouns is,</v>

210
00:13:01.871 --> 00:13:03.910
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably illegal.</v>

211
00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:05.830
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a variety of ways of looking at</v>

212
00:13:05.831 --> 00:13:08.650
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One way of looking at it is that there</v>

213
00:13:08.651 --> 00:13:12.430
<v Speaker 1>is a provision in the Ontario Human</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rights Code.</v>

214
00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:15.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is it,</v>

215
00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:20.160
<v Speaker 1>that any act or thing done or admitted</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be done in the course of his or her</v>

216
00:13:20.161 --> 00:13:24.360
<v Speaker 1>employment by an officer or official</v>
<v Speaker 1>employee or agent of a corporation,</v>

217
00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:29.070
<v Speaker 1>et cetera shall be deemed to be an act</v>
<v Speaker 1>or thing done or admitted to be done by</v>

218
00:13:29.071 --> 00:13:32.520
<v Speaker 1>the corporation trade union trade or</v>
<v Speaker 1>Occupational Association,</v>

219
00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:35.370
<v Speaker 1>Unincorporated Association or employer's</v>
<v Speaker 1>organization.</v>

220
00:13:35.371 --> 00:13:38.910
<v Speaker 1>So basically what that says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that section 46 point three,</v>

221
00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:44.270
<v Speaker 1>one of the human rights code is that if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have an employee who says something</v>

222
00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:48.450
<v Speaker 1>and it's not a good thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you are responsible for it as if</v>

223
00:13:48.451 --> 00:13:51.030
<v Speaker 1>you said it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is another part of the legislation</v>

224
00:13:51.031 --> 00:13:53.400
<v Speaker 1>that I was actually complaining about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the initial videos.</v>

225
00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:58.350
<v Speaker 1>And so the ot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think partly they wrote me this letter</v>

226
00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:02.550
<v Speaker 1>maybe because they had a conversation</v>
<v Speaker 1>with their legal department and they</v>

227
00:14:02.551 --> 00:14:03.031
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

228
00:14:03.031 --> 00:14:04.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this professor might be right.</v>

229
00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:08.370
<v Speaker 1>This could all be illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's even hate speech and if and</v>

230
00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:11.520
<v Speaker 1>if he's doing it then because you're his</v>
<v Speaker 1>employer,</v>

231
00:14:11.521 --> 00:14:15.090
<v Speaker 1>you're also responsible for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe that's part of the reason for</v>

232
00:14:15.091 --> 00:14:16.860
<v Speaker 1>the warning letter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anyways,</v>

233
00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:21.920
<v Speaker 1>they've decided that my refusal to use</v>
<v Speaker 1>gender neutral pronouns is potential.</v>

234
00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:24.360
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly discriminatory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>discriminatory,</v>

235
00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:26.760
<v Speaker 1>as far as they're concerned and may also</v>
<v Speaker 1>be illegal,</v>

236
00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:29.760
<v Speaker 1>which I would like to stress again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was exactly why I made the videos to</v>

237
00:14:29.761 --> 00:14:31.620
<v Speaker 1>begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like they're reminding me of</v>

238
00:14:31.621 --> 00:14:35.910
<v Speaker 1>something that I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the next part of it was,</v>

239
00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:38.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a discussion of distress in the</v>

240
00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:41.100
<v Speaker 1>University of Toronto community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have received communications from</v>

241
00:14:41.101 --> 00:14:45.960
<v Speaker 1>individual students and employee groups</v>
<v Speaker 1>finding my comments unacceptable.</v>

242
00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.720
<v Speaker 1>Emotionally disturbing and painful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

243
00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:51.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can watch the videos yourself,</v>

244
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.990
<v Speaker 1>see if they're emotionally disturbing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and painful.</v>

245
00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:58.250
<v Speaker 1>I might point out that if listening to</v>
<v Speaker 1>my comments is painful,</v>

246
00:14:58.251 --> 00:15:01.430
<v Speaker 1>then if you think that's painful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's possible that nothing actually</v>

247
00:15:01.431 --> 00:15:02.910
<v Speaker 1>painful has ever happened to you in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

248
00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:03.590
<v Speaker 1>in your life.</v>

249
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:05.300
<v Speaker 1>Like I was thinking over the last couple</v>
<v Speaker 1>of weeks,</v>

250
00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:08.030
<v Speaker 1>people have been asking me about how</v>
<v Speaker 1>stressful this is.</v>

251
00:15:08.031 --> 00:15:08.990
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

252
00:15:08.991 --> 00:15:09.500
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

253
00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:11.540
<v Speaker 1>it's no walk in the park,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you that,</v>

254
00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:14.030
<v Speaker 1>but compared to something that's really</v>
<v Speaker 1>stressful,</v>

255
00:15:14.031 --> 00:15:17.000
<v Speaker 1>like maybe a family member has cancer or</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

256
00:15:17.001 --> 00:15:20.680
<v Speaker 1>or that's a good one or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you're,</v>

257
00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:22.820
<v Speaker 1>you've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've actually been thrown in jail by</v>

258
00:15:22.821 --> 00:15:24.920
<v Speaker 1>an authoritarian society are being</v>
<v Speaker 1>tortured.</v>

259
00:15:24.921 --> 00:15:28.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is not very stressful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is political dialogue and you know,</v>

260
00:15:28.671 --> 00:15:32.330
<v Speaker 1>I would say that there was a week or two</v>
<v Speaker 1>there where I thought my job was</v>

261
00:15:32.331 --> 00:15:34.400
<v Speaker 1>probably in danger and maybe it still</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

262
00:15:34.401 --> 00:15:38.480
<v Speaker 1>but compared to a real pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real pain,</v>

263
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:42.530
<v Speaker 1>real suffering even that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't call it trivial,</v>

264
00:15:42.531 --> 00:15:45.320
<v Speaker 1>but it's not traumatic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's for sure.</v>

265
00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:47.360
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the statements,</v>

266
00:15:47.361 --> 00:15:51.200
<v Speaker 1>my statements and the invective that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>followed caused them to fear for their</v>

267
00:15:51.201 --> 00:15:54.890
<v Speaker 1>safety and they become the target of</v>
<v Speaker 1>specific and violent threats.</v>

268
00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:57.890
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I certainly think that threats directed</v>

269
00:15:57.891 --> 00:16:00.950
<v Speaker 1>to people are reprehensible and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not calling for that.</v>

270
00:16:00.951 --> 00:16:03.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm calling for reasoned and articulate</v>
<v Speaker 1>debate,</v>

271
00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:06.230
<v Speaker 1>but I would also like to point out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is another part of the letter</v>

272
00:16:06.231 --> 00:16:09.710
<v Speaker 1>that I seriously object to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that it would have been much better</v>

273
00:16:09.711 --> 00:16:11.570
<v Speaker 1>had the University of Toronto written me</v>
<v Speaker 1>and said,</v>

274
00:16:11.571 --> 00:16:14.330
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've received a whole variety of of</v>

275
00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:19.390
<v Speaker 1>communications regarding your videos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some positive and supportive and some</v>

276
00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:24.110
<v Speaker 1>critical and negative and having</v>
<v Speaker 1>carefully reviewed all of these.</v>

277
00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:27.920
<v Speaker 1>We've decided that it would be in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>best interest of the university and</v>

278
00:16:27.921 --> 00:16:31.040
<v Speaker 1>maybe in keeping with our policies and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the relevant laws.</v>

279
00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:33.530
<v Speaker 1>If you stopped saying these sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you're saying,</v>

280
00:16:33.531 --> 00:16:37.850
<v Speaker 1>but that isn't what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The letters select selectively omitted</v>

281
00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:42.290
<v Speaker 1>to mention the fact that the University</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Toronto has received a petition that</v>

282
00:16:42.291 --> 00:16:47.291
<v Speaker 1>has at least 5,000 signatures in support</v>
<v Speaker 1>of me and also several hundred letters,</v>

283
00:16:47.751 --> 00:16:52.520
<v Speaker 1>which I know because I've been cc'd on</v>
<v Speaker 1>them and that it appears that the bulk</v>

284
00:16:52.521 --> 00:16:54.530
<v Speaker 1>of public opinion is also on my side.</v>

285
00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:58.940
<v Speaker 1>None of that was mentioned in the letter</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that also taught me how institutions</v>

286
00:16:58.941 --> 00:17:01.670
<v Speaker 1>become corrupted when free speech is in</v>
<v Speaker 1>danger.</v>

287
00:17:01.671 --> 00:17:04.100
<v Speaker 1>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've often wondered this because I</v>

288
00:17:04.101 --> 00:17:07.520
<v Speaker 1>know that such things happened in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Soviet Union where people over decades</v>

289
00:17:07.521 --> 00:17:11.150
<v Speaker 1>swallowed very large lies and seems to</v>
<v Speaker 1>me that this is the way it happens.</v>

290
00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:13.520
<v Speaker 1>Institution start writing letters that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

291
00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:15.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that contained sins of omission,</v>

292
00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:16.730
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The omit,</v>

293
00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:21.020
<v Speaker 1>relevant information and that's and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and present a very biased in one sided</v>

294
00:17:21.021 --> 00:17:23.990
<v Speaker 1>view of an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then once that's written down,</v>

295
00:17:23.991 --> 00:17:28.100
<v Speaker 1>it becomes the reality because one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that psychologists do know is</v>

296
00:17:28.101 --> 00:17:30.710
<v Speaker 1>that if you write down a set of</v>
<v Speaker 1>opinions,</v>

297
00:17:30.711 --> 00:17:34.190
<v Speaker 1>those rapidly become your core beliefs</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you don't think that you had</v>

298
00:17:34.191 --> 00:17:35.840
<v Speaker 1>those beliefs before you wrote the</v>
<v Speaker 1>letter.</v>

299
00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:39.380
<v Speaker 1>So and then of course the issue with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>threats.</v>

300
00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:43.100
<v Speaker 1>That's a real interesting one because</v>
<v Speaker 1>when lauren southern was assaulted at</v>

301
00:17:43.101 --> 00:17:48.101
<v Speaker 1>the u of t free speech rally and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was captured on video and more than I</v>

302
00:17:48.741 --> 00:17:52.530
<v Speaker 1>would maybe 2 million people have</v>
<v Speaker 1>watched that now the university didn't</v>

303
00:17:52.531 --> 00:17:55.050
<v Speaker 1>say a thing about it in their public</v>
<v Speaker 1>communications.</v>

304
00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:59.320
<v Speaker 1>But when there were threats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rape threats made by some bone headed a</v>

305
00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:02.820
<v Speaker 1>morons online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we don't know who these people were</v>

306
00:18:02.821 --> 00:18:04.800
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know if they were trolls.</v>

307
00:18:04.801 --> 00:18:07.320
<v Speaker 1>We don't know if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they were provocateurs,</v>

308
00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:10.830
<v Speaker 1>we don't even know if they were the such</v>
<v Speaker 1>social justice warriors themselves.</v>

309
00:18:10.831 --> 00:18:13.560
<v Speaker 1>And I wouldn't put it past them because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've done that sort of thing in the</v>

310
00:18:13.561 --> 00:18:16.440
<v Speaker 1>past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these were threats from unverified</v>

311
00:18:16.441 --> 00:18:20.370
<v Speaker 1>sources that were posted online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The university immediately sent out a</v>

312
00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:23.070
<v Speaker 1>memo stating that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

313
00:18:23.071 --> 00:18:26.430
<v Speaker 1>an unsafe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>potentially unsafe atmosphere had been</v>

314
00:18:26.431 --> 00:18:28.890
<v Speaker 1>produced on campus and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

315
00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:34.040
<v Speaker 1>the university decries or as opposed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of violent and aggressive</v>

316
00:18:35.131 --> 00:18:36.690
<v Speaker 1>accent expressions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're up.</v>

317
00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:38.750
<v Speaker 1>But they didn't send out the same memo</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

318
00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:42.090
<v Speaker 1>when Lauren southern was assaulted at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the free speech rally.</v>

319
00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:43.410
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

320
00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:46.050
<v Speaker 1>they also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is particularly the case with</v>

321
00:18:46.051 --> 00:18:48.660
<v Speaker 1>Kelly hand and moffit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's the human resources vice</v>

322
00:18:48.661 --> 00:18:50.610
<v Speaker 1>president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I informed her,</v>

323
00:18:50.611 --> 00:18:54.060
<v Speaker 1>and many other people have that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>black liberation collective from whom</v>

324
00:18:54.061 --> 00:18:58.200
<v Speaker 1>she's taking advice with regards to</v>
<v Speaker 1>antiracism training has,</v>

325
00:18:58.860 --> 00:18:59.370
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

326
00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:03.410
<v Speaker 1>is the next best thing to a promoter of</v>
<v Speaker 1>violence in,</v>

327
00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:06.210
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in seeking social change according to</v>

328
00:19:06.211 --> 00:19:06.900
<v Speaker 1>their website.</v>

329
00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:10.920
<v Speaker 1>And is has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is run or has been organized by two</v>

330
00:19:10.921 --> 00:19:15.921
<v Speaker 1>women who have manifested in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>public behavior a number of things that</v>

331
00:19:16.111 --> 00:19:18.720
<v Speaker 1>I think a reasonable person would regard</v>
<v Speaker 1>as reprehensible.</v>

332
00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:22.300
<v Speaker 1>So that's another interesting thing is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the bar,</v>

333
00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:26.730
<v Speaker 1>the one sided reporting of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>constitutes a threat anyways,</v>

334
00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:30.540
<v Speaker 1>they say that they trust that these</v>
<v Speaker 1>impacts were not my intention,</v>

335
00:19:30.541 --> 00:19:33.180
<v Speaker 1>although they certainly implies strongly</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's my fault.</v>

336
00:19:33.181 --> 00:19:36.720
<v Speaker 1>And that's another thing I object to</v>
<v Speaker 1>because here's the thing to think about.</v>

337
00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:42.150
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that there's a forest in front</v>
<v Speaker 1>of you and it's extremely dry.</v>

338
00:19:42.151 --> 00:19:44.550
<v Speaker 1>It's extremely dry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been a long hot summer,</v>

339
00:19:44.551 --> 00:19:49.080
<v Speaker 1>or maybe it's been a drought and there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hot wind blowing and it's tinder dry.</v>

340
00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:53.040
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of deadwood because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there hasn't been a fire for a very long</v>

341
00:19:53.041 --> 00:19:54.980
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the,</v>

342
00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:59.790
<v Speaker 1>the conditions are poised for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>conflagration and someone comes along</v>

343
00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:01.760
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

344
00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:03.060
<v Speaker 1>produces a spark.</v>

345
00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:06.120
<v Speaker 1>You can't blame the conflagration on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>spark.</v>

346
00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:11.060
<v Speaker 1>Now I sparked this storm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean the deadwood</v>

347
00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:13.590
<v Speaker 1>hadn't already gathered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of things that our society</v>

348
00:20:13.591 --> 00:20:17.730
<v Speaker 1>needs to talk out and to lay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The trouble that's emerged because of</v>

349
00:20:17.731 --> 00:20:19.650
<v Speaker 1>these videos at my feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think is a,</v>

350
00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:24.810
<v Speaker 1>to call it an underhanded ploys is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a very mild statement.</v>

351
00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:27.660
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like Jordan Peterson is responsible</v>

352
00:20:27.661 --> 00:20:31.050
<v Speaker 1>for this media storm about political</v>
<v Speaker 1>correctness is like,</v>

353
00:20:31.051 --> 00:20:35.970
<v Speaker 1>I think I don't think so much as I might</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to take credit for it from a purely</v>

354
00:20:35.971 --> 00:20:40.080
<v Speaker 1>egotistical perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the groundwork for all of this was</v>

355
00:20:40.081 --> 00:20:42.180
<v Speaker 1>late,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well before I made my videos.</v>

356
00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:45.750
<v Speaker 1>And the only reason I had they had the</v>
<v Speaker 1>effect they did is because I actually</v>

357
00:20:45.751 --> 00:20:47.910
<v Speaker 1>said that there was something that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pc,</v>

358
00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:51.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thugs want me to do that I'm not going</v>

359
00:20:51.521 --> 00:20:52.060
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>

360
00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:56.110
<v Speaker 1>So I drew a line and it happened to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>around issues of gender nomenclature,</v>

361
00:20:56.111 --> 00:20:58.840
<v Speaker 1>but it could have been somewhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so of course,</v>

362
00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:01.030
<v Speaker 1>because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been,</v>

363
00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:03.610
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>attacked in various ways</v>

364
00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.810
<v Speaker 1>on the gender issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is also a very important issue</v>

365
00:21:07.811 --> 00:21:09.370
<v Speaker 1>which we need to discuss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

366
00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:11.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could have been in some way.</v>

367
00:21:11.561 --> 00:21:15.850
<v Speaker 1>It could have been any other issue where</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody else drew a line anyways.</v>

368
00:21:15.851 --> 00:21:18.370
<v Speaker 1>Then they request that I start repeating</v>
<v Speaker 1>these statements.</v>

369
00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:19.900
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so here we go.</v>

370
00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:25.560
<v Speaker 1>I am not going to use made up pronouns</v>
<v Speaker 1>to refer to people at their whim.</v>

371
00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:28.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing it and I'm not going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>silent either.</v>

372
00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:32.170
<v Speaker 1>And that's that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they remind me that I have an</v>

373
00:21:32.171 --> 00:21:36.040
<v Speaker 1>obligation to uphold the law into</v>
<v Speaker 1>including the Ontario human rights code</v>

374
00:21:36.041 --> 00:21:39.250
<v Speaker 1>and to deal fairly and ethically with</v>
<v Speaker 1>students.</v>

375
00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:40.413
<v Speaker 1>Which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

376
00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:43.510
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I knew that there might be a legal</v>

377
00:21:43.511 --> 00:21:45.850
<v Speaker 1>issue and that's why I made the videos</v>
<v Speaker 1>to begin with.</v>

378
00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:49.870
<v Speaker 1>So that hardly came as a surprise and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually think it's quite comical in a</v>

379
00:21:49.871 --> 00:21:53.920
<v Speaker 1>darkly ironic way that the university</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself is the institution that's</v>

380
00:21:53.921 --> 00:21:58.570
<v Speaker 1>verifying my primary concern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was that making the video itself</v>

381
00:21:58.571 --> 00:22:01.150
<v Speaker 1>was likely illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to think about that because</v>

382
00:22:01.151 --> 00:22:03.760
<v Speaker 1>that's a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a bad thing.</v>

383
00:22:03.761 --> 00:22:08.410
<v Speaker 1>It shows you very clearly that freedom</v>
<v Speaker 1>of speech is under attack in Canada and</v>

384
00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:11.140
<v Speaker 1>elsewhere of course as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why there's been so much</v>

385
00:22:11.141 --> 00:22:14.890
<v Speaker 1>international attention given to this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sequence of events.</v>

386
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:18.040
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

387
00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:22.390
<v Speaker 1>they also suggest that this might</v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior undermines my ability to</v>

388
00:22:22.391 --> 00:22:25.090
<v Speaker 1>conduct essential components of your job</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a faculty member.</v>

389
00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:27.070
<v Speaker 1>I disagree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of them mentally.</v>

390
00:22:27.071 --> 00:22:31.360
<v Speaker 1>My fundamental job as a faculty member</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to speak what I perceive to be the</v>

391
00:22:31.361 --> 00:22:32.020
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>

392
00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:34.900
<v Speaker 1>And that doesn't mean I'm right and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean that I am speaking the</v>

393
00:22:34.901 --> 00:22:37.240
<v Speaker 1>truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that I'm trying to speak the truth</v>

394
00:22:37.241 --> 00:22:40.570
<v Speaker 1>and I'm also trying to listen to people</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that I can speak the truth more</v>

395
00:22:40.571 --> 00:22:42.820
<v Speaker 1>carefully and I'm not going to stop</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing that.</v>

396
00:22:42.821 --> 00:22:46.390
<v Speaker 1>And that does not undermine my ability</v>
<v Speaker 1>to conduct essential components of my</v>

397
00:22:46.391 --> 00:22:47.980
<v Speaker 1>job as a faculty member.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

398
00:22:47.981 --> 00:22:51.370
<v Speaker 1>that is precisely and absolutely my job</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a faculty member.</v>

399
00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:55.570
<v Speaker 1>And then of course to act consistent</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the law and university policy.</v>

400
00:22:55.571 --> 00:22:57.910
<v Speaker 1>While we've already covered that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>

401
00:22:57.911 --> 00:23:01.060
<v Speaker 1>here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sat in the first video that making the</v>

402
00:23:01.061 --> 00:23:04.720
<v Speaker 1>video was probably illegal and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>University of Toronto agrees with me or</v>

403
00:23:04.721 --> 00:23:07.870
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't be warning me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we need to think about that and then</v>

404
00:23:07.871 --> 00:23:11.140
<v Speaker 1>there's a bit of hand waving about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>uft deploring acts of violence and the</v>

405
00:23:11.141 --> 00:23:12.430
<v Speaker 1>disruption of civil debate.</v>

406
00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:13.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might deploy it,</v>

407
00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:17.350
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't do anything about it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't even report on it when it</v>

408
00:23:17.351 --> 00:23:19.660
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think that their claims,</v>

409
00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:25.110
<v Speaker 1>their fundamental claims to have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say peace and safety as their</v>

410
00:23:26.261 --> 00:23:29.830
<v Speaker 1>primary concern and I'm not even sure</v>
<v Speaker 1>that should be the primary concern</v>

411
00:23:29.831 --> 00:23:33.670
<v Speaker 1>because truth trumps peace and safety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that their actions,</v>

412
00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:36.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the administration's actions do not</v>

413
00:23:36.461 --> 00:23:41.461
<v Speaker 1>indicate a very clear commitment to</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly to exactly the principles state</v>

414
00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:44.380
<v Speaker 1>they claim to uphold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

415
00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:46.430
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what did I do about this?</v>

416
00:23:46.431 --> 00:23:47.420
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what happened.</v>

417
00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:49.340
<v Speaker 1>I went and meet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>met the Dean,</v>

418
00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:52.280
<v Speaker 1>David Cameron on Friday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dropped in on him.</v>

419
00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:55.340
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was kind of nervous as far as I can</v>

420
00:23:55.341 --> 00:23:56.570
<v Speaker 1>tell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's an older guy.</v>

421
00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:58.480
<v Speaker 1>I think he's a decent guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

422
00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:01.760
<v Speaker 1>he listened to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we had a very productive</v>

423
00:24:01.761 --> 00:24:02.420
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>

424
00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:06.260
<v Speaker 1>I went through my concerns about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>letter and then what I suggested to him</v>

425
00:24:06.261 --> 00:24:10.070
<v Speaker 1>was that the University of Toronto host</v>
<v Speaker 1>a series of debates,</v>

426
00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:13.580
<v Speaker 1>a debate or a series of debates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like to see three of them where</v>

427
00:24:13.581 --> 00:24:15.950
<v Speaker 1>we discussed such things as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

428
00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:22.120
<v Speaker 1>the biological determination of gender</v>
<v Speaker 1>versus the environmental determination</v>

429
00:24:22.521 --> 00:24:24.470
<v Speaker 1>of gender identity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be a good debate.</v>

430
00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:28.550
<v Speaker 1>We could have a debate on whether</v>
<v Speaker 1>Western society is an oppressive</v>

431
00:24:28.551 --> 00:24:31.100
<v Speaker 1>patriarchy or an enlightened</v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization.</v>

432
00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:35.540
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to have that debate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the last debate would be</v>

433
00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:38.420
<v Speaker 1>freedom of speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be something like freedom of speech</v>

434
00:24:38.421 --> 00:24:41.900
<v Speaker 1>versus social justice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that would be three topics I said we</v>

435
00:24:41.901 --> 00:24:44.360
<v Speaker 1>could have a civilized debate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The university could host it,</v>

436
00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:47.180
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we could sort these things out like</v>

437
00:24:47.181 --> 00:24:51.470
<v Speaker 1>civilized human beings and maybe the</v>
<v Speaker 1>University of Toronto could be a beacon</v>

438
00:24:51.471 --> 00:24:52.670
<v Speaker 1>on a hill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

439
00:24:52.671 --> 00:24:53.840
<v Speaker 1>which is what we should be.</v>

440
00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:57.110
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it would also help all the</v>

441
00:24:57.111 --> 00:25:00.620
<v Speaker 1>universities in the United States and in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the western world that are wrestling</v>

442
00:25:00.621 --> 00:25:03.440
<v Speaker 1>with these sorts of things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clarify the issues and,</v>

443
00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:06.920
<v Speaker 1>and move our society had in a productive</v>
<v Speaker 1>and peaceful way.</v>

444
00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:10.400
<v Speaker 1>Because I thought about before I went</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the meeting with the Dean what the</v>

445
00:25:10.401 --> 00:25:13.850
<v Speaker 1>best possible outcome could be and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be victory for me because I'm</v>

446
00:25:13.851 --> 00:25:17.360
<v Speaker 1>not after victory for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm after truth and peace.</v>

447
00:25:17.361 --> 00:25:19.160
<v Speaker 1>At least that's what I'm trying to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>after.</v>

448
00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:21.620
<v Speaker 1>And so I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I discussed this with my and my</v>

449
00:25:21.621 --> 00:25:24.170
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would be the best possible outcome?</v>

450
00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:25.660
<v Speaker 1>And one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

451
00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:29.330
<v Speaker 1>one not good outcome would be the</v>
<v Speaker 1>entrenchment of the two positions into</v>

452
00:25:29.331 --> 00:25:34.331
<v Speaker 1>increasingly rigid blocks and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>escalation of the situation in a</v>

453
00:25:34.701 --> 00:25:37.700
<v Speaker 1>nonproductive way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then another productive way would be</v>

454
00:25:37.701 --> 00:25:39.560
<v Speaker 1>to think of this as an opportunity and</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

455
00:25:39.561 --> 00:25:41.510
<v Speaker 1>look man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could have a real discussion at this</v>

456
00:25:41.511 --> 00:25:42.344
<v Speaker 1>university.</v>

457
00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:45.740
<v Speaker 1>It's a great institution with shoulder</v>
<v Speaker 1>our damn responsibility.</v>

458
00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:48.680
<v Speaker 1>We'll have a debate and will enlighten</v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves and the public.</v>

459
00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:52.070
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm going to meet with David</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cameron here in about half an hour and</v>

460
00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:55.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to find out what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>university has to say about that.</v>

461
00:25:56.120 --> 00:26:00.710
<v Speaker 1>So thanks very much for listening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I guess I'll close with this.</v>

462
00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:03.470
<v Speaker 1>I would say to my fellow Canadian</v>
<v Speaker 1>citizens,</v>

463
00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:07.640
<v Speaker 1>you guys better wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the true north is no longer</v>

464
00:26:07.641 --> 00:26:11.660
<v Speaker 1>strong nor free as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and are our rights to free speech are</v>

465
00:26:11.661 --> 00:26:15.110
<v Speaker 1>under assault and you better wake up</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's not pretty and it's not</v>

466
00:26:15.111 --> 00:26:17.510
<v Speaker 1>good and it's happening a lot faster</v>
<v Speaker 1>than you think.</v>

467
00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:19.520
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that happened on</v>
<v Speaker 1>Friday,</v>

468
00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:21.500
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was announced in the globe and Mail,</v>

469
00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:24.230
<v Speaker 1>is that the liberal government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the justice minister,</v>

470
00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:28.910
<v Speaker 1>so to so called justice minister has</v>
<v Speaker 1>decided that to pick our judiciary,</v>

471
00:26:28.911 --> 00:26:31.670
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the most important</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that can happen in a country.</v>

472
00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:36.110
<v Speaker 1>The candidates for the judiciary now</v>
<v Speaker 1>will be required to produce a dossier</v>

473
00:26:36.111 --> 00:26:38.690
<v Speaker 1>listing out their group identities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>race,</v>

474
00:26:38.691 --> 00:26:39.830
<v Speaker 1>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sex,</v>

475
00:26:39.831 --> 00:26:40.760
<v Speaker 1>gender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>identity,</v>

476
00:26:40.761 --> 00:26:44.640
<v Speaker 1>gender expression and all the things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that differentiate us by group</v>

477
00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:48.390
<v Speaker 1>membership.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the people who picked the</v>

478
00:26:48.391 --> 00:26:53.391
<v Speaker 1>judiciary are going to be subjected to</v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious reeducation of their</v>

479
00:26:54.061 --> 00:26:57.210
<v Speaker 1>unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so unconscious anti racism and anti bias</v>

480
00:26:57.211 --> 00:27:00.660
<v Speaker 1>training so that they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that they're not biased when they</v>

481
00:27:00.661 --> 00:27:04.860
<v Speaker 1>review the candidates with the aim of</v>
<v Speaker 1>selecting candidates on the basis of</v>

482
00:27:04.861 --> 00:27:05.730
<v Speaker 1>their identity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

483
00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:08.430
<v Speaker 1>and I think there's nothing more racist</v>
<v Speaker 1>than that period.</v>

484
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.330
<v Speaker 1>And so that almost passed unnoticed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say with regards to</v>

485
00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:15.660
<v Speaker 1>unconscious bias training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

486
00:27:15.661 --> 00:27:17.880
<v Speaker 1>we can't measure unconscious bias very</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

487
00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:21.240
<v Speaker 1>This is all the implicit association</v>
<v Speaker 1>test and you can look that up.</v>

488
00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:24.180
<v Speaker 1>We can't measure that very well because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the test isn't very reliable.</v>

489
00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:28.980
<v Speaker 1>It was never intended to be used to</v>
<v Speaker 1>document individual's unconscious bias.</v>

490
00:27:28.981 --> 00:27:30.660
<v Speaker 1>But that's where this idea has come</v>
<v Speaker 1>from.</v>

491
00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:33.600
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's huge debate on what that bias</v>

492
00:27:33.601 --> 00:27:34.201
<v Speaker 1>means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

493
00:27:34.201 --> 00:27:37.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that it means what the,</v>

494
00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:40.170
<v Speaker 1>what the proponents of unconscious</v>
<v Speaker 1>racial bias say.</v>

495
00:27:40.171 --> 00:27:42.240
<v Speaker 1>It means the science is far from</v>
<v Speaker 1>settled.</v>

496
00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:45.300
<v Speaker 1>And I mean far from settled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a serious topic of discussion.</v>

497
00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:46.513
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

498
00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:49.840
<v Speaker 1>and then to educate people out of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious biases.</v>

499
00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:51.870
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an Orwellian thing,</v>

500
00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:54.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one thing to pete controls people's</v>

501
00:27:54.121 --> 00:27:56.670
<v Speaker 1>speech that's bad enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when you start controlling</v>

502
00:27:56.671 --> 00:27:58.650
<v Speaker 1>what they can say instead of what they</v>
<v Speaker 1>can say,</v>

503
00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:02.010
<v Speaker 1>but then to go after their unconscious</v>
<v Speaker 1>minds and then to make that a</v>

504
00:28:02.011 --> 00:28:04.920
<v Speaker 1>precondition for the panels that select</v>
<v Speaker 1>our judiciary,</v>

505
00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:07.830
<v Speaker 1>it's like this isn't good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't good.</v>

506
00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:11.970
<v Speaker 1>And I'm speaking as a psychologist and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>student of authoritarianism and</v>

507
00:28:11.971 --> 00:28:15.540
<v Speaker 1>political psychopathology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So wake up,</v>

508
00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:18.750
<v Speaker 1>this isn't good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do something about it.</v>

509
00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:23.580
<v Speaker 1>And I've got a website started that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'm where I'm going to post things</v>

510
00:28:23.581 --> 00:28:24.630
<v Speaker 1>that people can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

511
00:28:24.631 --> 00:28:26.550
<v Speaker 1>But that'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'll happen later in the week.</v>

512
00:28:26.551 --> 00:28:28.530
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks for listening.</v>

513
00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:31.140
