00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.120
<v Speaker 1>This is Jocko podcast number one 55 with</v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

2
00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:09.690
<v Speaker 1>Jocko willink</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the island.</v>

3
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.640
<v Speaker 1>The dead were piling up.</v>

4
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:15.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:15.953
<v Speaker 1>In the mission report,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the head of the convoy wrote at 2:00 PM </v>

6
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.050
<v Speaker 1>on May 20th I went to the island of Xeno</v>
<v Speaker 1>with commander taps golf.</v>

7
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.023
<v Speaker 1>There was a terrible scramble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People crowding and fighting around the </v>

8
00:00:33.751 --> 00:00:38.170
<v Speaker 1>bags of flour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dead bodies everywhere.</v>

9
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:39.573
<v Speaker 1>A hundred or more and lots of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>crawling about and crying give us bread </v>

10
00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:46.083
<v Speaker 1>boss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been two days since we've been </v>

11
00:00:47.561 --> 00:00:48.394
<v Speaker 1>given anything to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to make us die of hunger </v>

12
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:54.103
<v Speaker 1>and the cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They told us that people had begun </v>

13
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.370
<v Speaker 1>eating the dead bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they were cooking human flesh.</v>

14
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.490
<v Speaker 1>The scene on the island was dreadful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Appalling.</v>

15
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.463
<v Speaker 1>On May 21st alone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the three health officer's counted 70 </v>

16
00:01:20.551 --> 00:01:25.551
<v Speaker 1>additional dead bodies in five cases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They emphasized the liver,</v>

17
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.200
<v Speaker 1>the heart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lungs and fleshy part of bodies.</v>

18
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:32.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

19
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.380
<v Speaker 1>Had been caught off.</v>

20
00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:35.763
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

21
00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.340
<v Speaker 1>On one of the bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the head had been torn off along the,</v>

22
00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.960
<v Speaker 1>along with the male genital organs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the skin.</v>

23
00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.680
<v Speaker 1>These mutilations constitutes strong </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence of cannibalistic acts.</v>

24
00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:51.663
<v Speaker 1>In addition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they suggest the existence of serious </v>

25
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.420
<v Speaker 1>psychopathology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's on the same day.</v>

26
00:01:58.421 --> 00:01:59.254
<v Speaker 1>May 21st the deportees themselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>brought us three individuals who had </v>

27
00:02:04.031 --> 00:02:09.031
<v Speaker 1>been caught with blood on their hands </v>
<v Speaker 1>and holding human livers.</v>

28
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.213
<v Speaker 1>Our examination of these three </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals did not reveal any extreme </v>

29
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.300
<v Speaker 1>NACAC one</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's an elderly,</v>

30
00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.890
<v Speaker 1>local peasant woman who reported the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things we saw.</v>

31
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.940
<v Speaker 1>People were dying everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were killing each other.</v>

32
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.110
<v Speaker 1>There was a guard name Kostia the Nico </v>
<v Speaker 1>off a young fellow.</v>

33
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.880
<v Speaker 1>He was courting a pretty girl who had </v>
<v Speaker 1>been sent there.</v>

34
00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.050
<v Speaker 1>He protected her.</v>

35
00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

36
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.710
<v Speaker 1>One day he had to be away for a while</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he told one of his comrades,</v>

37
00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>take care of her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with all the people,</v>

38
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.190
<v Speaker 2>the comrade couldn't do much.</v>

39
00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.250
<v Speaker 1>People caught the girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tied her to a tree,</v>

40
00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.770
<v Speaker 1>cut off her breasts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her muscles,</v>

41
00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.950
<v Speaker 1>everything they could eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were hungry.</v>

42
00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.030
<v Speaker 1>They had to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When costs are you came back,</v>

43
00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.880
<v Speaker 1>she was still alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He tried to save her,</v>

44
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.650
<v Speaker 1>but she had lost too much blood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She died.</v>

45
00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.730
<v Speaker 1>That was the kind of thing that happened</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you went along the island.</v>

46
00:03:39.731 --> 00:03:42.250
<v Speaker 1>You saw flesh wrapped in rags.</v>

47
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:44.320
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

48
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.330
<v Speaker 1>Human flesh that had been cut.</v>

49
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:48.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

50
00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.340
<v Speaker 1>And hung in the trees.</v>

51
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.253
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

52
00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.143
<v Speaker 1>And that right there is from a book </v>
<v Speaker 1>called Cannibal Island by Nicholas </v>

53
00:04:00.551 --> 00:04:05.551
<v Speaker 1>worth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's written books about communism.</v>

54
00:04:07.061 --> 00:04:07.894
<v Speaker 1>I think his most famous as the black </v>
<v Speaker 1>book of communism and Cannibal Island </v>

55
00:04:12.611 --> 00:04:13.444
<v Speaker 1>specifically breaks down one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>small individual nightmares of the </v>

56
00:04:19.031 --> 00:04:19.864
<v Speaker 1>Soviet gulags.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the nightmare was not small and it </v>

57
00:04:27.971 --> 00:04:31.750
<v Speaker 1>certainly was not specific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was widespread and it was broad</v>

58
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.260
<v Speaker 1>and it was almost incomprehensible.</v>

59
00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:37.593
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

60
00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.210
<v Speaker 1>And very little about it would be known </v>
<v Speaker 1>or not for one man,</v>

61
00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.113
<v Speaker 1>Alexander Solzhenitsyn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who not only survive the gulags but </v>

62
00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:52.733
<v Speaker 1>lived on to write incredibly detailed </v>
<v Speaker 1>and very well researched to books about </v>

63
00:04:59.041 --> 00:05:01.050
<v Speaker 1>the gulags.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them were fictionalized</v>

64
00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.710
<v Speaker 1>like a day in the life of Ivan </v>
<v Speaker 1>Denisovich and for the,</v>

65
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:08.663
<v Speaker 1>for the good of the cause,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most comprehensively in his three </v>

66
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.640
<v Speaker 1>volume tome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Gulag archipelago</v>

67
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.273
<v Speaker 1>and this series is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a massive series and it's been cut </v>

68
00:05:20.881 --> 00:05:25.881
<v Speaker 1>down to an abridged version that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually approved by the author himself.</v>

69
00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:31.560
<v Speaker 1>And the abridged version has just been </v>
<v Speaker 1>rereleased in Europe with a forward by a</v>

70
00:05:31.561 --> 00:05:32.394
<v Speaker 1>man that I think repopulate [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 1>that book a man that is here today to </v>

71
00:05:37.621 --> 00:05:40.410
<v Speaker 1>discuss that book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And among other things,</v>

72
00:05:40.411 --> 00:05:45.411
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure a man that I needed to give an </v>
<v Speaker 1>introduction to the first time he was on</v>

73
00:05:45.661 --> 00:05:46.494
<v Speaker 1>this podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now who needs no introduction </v>

74
00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:54.650
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a man by the name of Dr. Jordan B.</v>

75
00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.520
<v Speaker 1>Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jordan,</v>

76
00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.510
<v Speaker 1>thank you for coming back on.</v>

77
00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:04.050
<v Speaker 3>How's it rough beginning Jocko.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus.</v>

78
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.650
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

79
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.340
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I started listening to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

80
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.180
<v Speaker 1>you would say something along the lines </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that,</v>

81
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:15.163
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are quite capable of creating hell </v>

82
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:21.700
<v Speaker 1>for ourselves as human beings and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly that situation.</v>

83
00:06:24.561 --> 00:06:26.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>

84
00:06:26.111 --> 00:06:27.500
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's hell yeah.</v>

85
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.580
<v Speaker 1>And close enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

86
00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:32.630
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

87
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.780
<v Speaker 1>it's created by us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's created by us,</v>

88
00:06:35.781 --> 00:06:36.740
<v Speaker 1>which I think is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

89
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.970
<v Speaker 1>obviously horrific and the Gulag </v>
<v Speaker 1>archipelago,</v>

90
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:41.900
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

91
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:43.820
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you talked about that book a lot and,</v>

92
00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:48.840
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things that on that book </v>
<v Speaker 1>hits you hard obviously for me,</v>

93
00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:50.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

94
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:53.750
<v Speaker 1>there's a book called about face by </v>
<v Speaker 1>Colonel David Hackworth.</v>

95
00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:58.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm from a different world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess the you in many ways.</v>

96
00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:01.490
<v Speaker 1>The book that hit me hardest in my life </v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

97
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:02.353
<v Speaker 1>was that book about face and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those things that when I </v>

98
00:07:07.641 --> 00:07:09.210
<v Speaker 1>read it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started putting it together.</v>

99
00:07:09.211 --> 00:07:14.211
<v Speaker 1>It's like things started to fit and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember that and I was wondering,</v>

100
00:07:16.551 --> 00:07:17.384
<v Speaker 1>I guess from my perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at what point did you read the Gulag </v>

101
00:07:21.951 --> 00:07:25.670
<v Speaker 1>archipelago and at what point did you </v>
<v Speaker 1>start to say,</v>

102
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:29.390
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something really,</v>

103
00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:32.750
<v Speaker 1>really important here for me to try and </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand?</v>

104
00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.450
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read it back in the 1980s,</v>

105
00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:37.703
<v Speaker 3>early,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say I'd read some Solzhenitsyn </v>

106
00:07:41.401 --> 00:07:44.040
<v Speaker 3>before that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read the late Dave Dave,</v>

107
00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:48.210
<v Speaker 3>a day in the life of Ivan Denisovich </v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was about 13 or 14.</v>

108
00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:53.100
<v Speaker 3>And then I read the Gulag archipelago in</v>
<v Speaker 3>my early twenties.</v>

109
00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:57.660
<v Speaker 3>When I was reading a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychological material too,</v>

110
00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:02.350
<v Speaker 3>when I started reading young and Freud </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the great clinicians and uh,</v>

111
00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:03.573
<v Speaker 3>or is reading a fair bit about what had </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened in Nazi Germany at the same </v>

112
00:08:05.671 --> 00:08:06.504
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also Viktor Frankl's man's search </v>

113
00:08:08.791 --> 00:08:09.624
<v Speaker 3>for meaning and Solzhenitsyn's book is </v>
<v Speaker 3>in some ways like an elaborated </v>

114
00:08:14.101 --> 00:08:14.934
<v Speaker 3>extension of Frankel Frankel of course </v>
<v Speaker 3>described what happened to him in the </v>

115
00:08:17.671 --> 00:08:18.504
<v Speaker 3>Nazi concentration camps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's a relatively short book and </v>

116
00:08:20.881 --> 00:08:23.490
<v Speaker 3>it's a great book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But soldier Nixon's book is,</v>

117
00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:26.250
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's much broader and,</v>

118
00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:27.443
<v Speaker 3>and I would say deeper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the thing that affected me most </v>

119
00:08:32.461 --> 00:08:35.790
<v Speaker 3>particularly was the psychological take </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the,</v>

120
00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:38.100
<v Speaker 3>on the totalitarian states.</v>

121
00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:41.580
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had been studying political science up</v>

122
00:08:41.581 --> 00:08:42.414
<v Speaker 3>to that point and the political science </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientists and the economists who I </v>

123
00:08:48.421 --> 00:08:53.040
<v Speaker 3>would say we're under the sway of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Marxists thinking,</v>

124
00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:55.770
<v Speaker 3>although not nearly to the degree that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are now,</v>

125
00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:01.200
<v Speaker 3>we're convinced that the reason that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people engaged in conflict was basically</v>

126
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.710
<v Speaker 3>a consequence of argumentation over </v>
<v Speaker 3>resources.</v>

127
00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:05.663
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was basically an economic argument </v>

128
00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.390
<v Speaker 3>and I never bought that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It never made sense to me.</v>

129
00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:10.493
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously there are circumstances where </v>

130
00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:12.384
<v Speaker 3>that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it didn't seem to be fundamentally </v>

131
00:09:13.891 --> 00:09:14.724
<v Speaker 3>the case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like tribal warfare isn't precisely </v>

132
00:09:16.921 --> 00:09:19.890
<v Speaker 3>about resources.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's maybe it's about territory or maybe</v>

133
00:09:19.891 --> 00:09:20.724
<v Speaker 3>it's about identity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it never seemed to me to be simply </v>

134
00:09:23.791 --> 00:09:25.680
<v Speaker 3>about resources.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

135
00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:29.640
<v Speaker 3>partly because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well a resource is something that people</v>

136
00:09:29.641 --> 00:09:30.474
<v Speaker 3>value,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it isn't obvious why people value </v>

137
00:09:32.851 --> 00:09:33.684
<v Speaker 3>what they value.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it doesn't solve the fundamental </v>

138
00:09:35.221 --> 00:09:35.880
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>

139
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:36.713
<v Speaker 3>Anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I was reading Frankel and </v>

140
00:09:37.981 --> 00:09:38.814
<v Speaker 3>Solzhenitsyn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started to more deeply understand the </v>

141
00:09:42.661 --> 00:09:46.140
<v Speaker 3>relationship between the individual and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the atrocity.</v>

142
00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:47.663
<v Speaker 3>And that's what I found most interesting</v>
<v Speaker 3>was that Frankel's claim and </v>

143
00:09:51.781 --> 00:09:52.614
<v Speaker 3>Solzhenitsyn's claim as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it was the moral corruption of the </v>

144
00:09:56.461 --> 00:10:01.461
<v Speaker 3>citizenry that allowed the totalitarian </v>
<v Speaker 3>catastrophes to occur.</v>

145
00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:03.803
<v Speaker 3>And that that in some sense was the </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibility of every individual in </v>

146
00:10:07.471 --> 00:10:11.460
<v Speaker 3>the system who looked the other way or </v>
<v Speaker 3>who participated actively.</v>

147
00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:14.400
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even in the gulag camps themselves,</v>

148
00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:17.070
<v Speaker 3>they were almost all run by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>prisoners.</v>

149
00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:18.143
<v Speaker 3>There wasn't enough administrative </v>
<v Speaker 3>manpower to run the prison system </v>

150
00:10:21.391 --> 00:10:23.490
<v Speaker 3>without the cooperation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so to speak,</v>

151
00:10:23.491 --> 00:10:25.920
<v Speaker 3>of the prisoners.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it is,</v>

152
00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:26.783
<v Speaker 3>it is a surreal sort of hell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Were you in prison yourself and </v>

153
00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:34.860
<v Speaker 3>Solzhenitsyn's fundamental claim,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this was true for Franklin as well,</v>

154
00:10:34.861 --> 00:10:39.750
<v Speaker 3>and also for Vaclav Havel who eventually</v>
<v Speaker 3>became president of Czechoslovakia,</v>

155
00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:42.150
<v Speaker 3>or at least of the Czech Republic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember which,</v>

156
00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:43.813
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they believe that it was the individual </v>

157
00:10:46.021 --> 00:10:46.854
<v Speaker 3>proclivity to accept lies that fostered </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ability of tyrants to destroy the </v>

158
00:10:53.011 --> 00:10:53.844
<v Speaker 3>state.</v>

159
00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:57.090
<v Speaker 3>And then</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

160
00:10:57.091 --> 00:10:57.924
<v Speaker 3>and that also led to complicitness with </v>
<v Speaker 3>regards to all the absolute atrocities </v>

161
00:11:01.831 --> 00:11:03.960
<v Speaker 3>that were occurring in both the Nazi </v>
<v Speaker 3>state,</v>

162
00:11:03.961 --> 00:11:07.980
<v Speaker 3>in the and in the Soviet state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's true when I read,</v>

163
00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:09.293
<v Speaker 3>like I read soldier Knutson's books in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that a lot of the books I read about </v>

164
00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:16.200
<v Speaker 3>Nazi Germany to not as a victim and not </v>
<v Speaker 3>as a hero,</v>

165
00:11:16.201 --> 00:11:18.090
<v Speaker 3>but as a perpetrator,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

166
00:11:18.091 --> 00:11:18.924
<v Speaker 3>which I think it's really important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something that's really important </v>

167
00:11:20.971 --> 00:11:25.950
<v Speaker 3>to do when you read history is that it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>easy to cast yourself as a victim.</v>

168
00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:27.563
<v Speaker 3>It's easy to cast yourself as the person</v>
<v Speaker 3>who would have been heroic in the </v>

169
00:11:29.851 --> 00:11:30.684
<v Speaker 3>circumstance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's also unbelievably useful to </v>

170
00:11:33.061 --> 00:11:33.894
<v Speaker 3>understand that there's a good chance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Had you been in those situations that </v>

171
00:11:38.011 --> 00:11:41.280
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't have been on the side of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the good guys and,</v>

172
00:11:41.281 --> 00:11:42.330
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's a terrible,</v>

173
00:11:42.331 --> 00:11:45.780
<v Speaker 3>it's really a terrible realization,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

174
00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:50.460
<v Speaker 3>it's necessary realization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

175
00:11:50.461 --> 00:11:53.590
<v Speaker 3>just going back to this idea of what you</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of reading,</v>

176
00:11:53.591 --> 00:11:54.070
<v Speaker 3>because people</v>

177
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:54.903
<v Speaker 1>ask me now because I read books all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time on my podcast and what you just </v>

178
00:11:58.841 --> 00:12:01.660
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it struck me as something that's,</v>

179
00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:04.113
<v Speaker 1>people have told me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read that book before but I didn't </v>

180
00:12:06.761 --> 00:12:07.594
<v Speaker 1>really get out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you got out of it and when I heard </v>

181
00:12:10.811 --> 00:12:12.850
<v Speaker 1>you read it I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was saying,</v>

182
00:12:12.851 --> 00:12:15.190
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did I need to go reread this book?</v>

183
00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:16.623
<v Speaker 1>And I think one of the key things is you</v>
<v Speaker 1>looked at these books as you were not </v>

184
00:12:20.021 --> 00:12:21.190
<v Speaker 1>the victim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the perpetrator.</v>

185
00:12:21.191 --> 00:12:24.700
<v Speaker 1>One thing that when I read books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I read a lot of books,</v>

186
00:12:24.701 --> 00:12:29.701
<v Speaker 1>mostly about war for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always think about the,</v>

187
00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.220
<v Speaker 1>the people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

188
00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:32.113
<v Speaker 1>We see myself as the person that goes </v>
<v Speaker 1>and heroically storms the beaches and </v>

189
00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:40.210
<v Speaker 1>survives every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

190
00:12:40.211 --> 00:12:41.044
<v Speaker 1>in a war book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's these people that get mentioned </v>

191
00:12:42.761 --> 00:12:43.441
<v Speaker 1>for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for it,</v>

192
00:12:43.441 --> 00:12:44.900
<v Speaker 1>for a half a paragraph,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

193
00:12:44.901 --> 00:12:45.970
<v Speaker 1>for two sentences.</v>

194
00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:49.630
<v Speaker 1>And that sometimes they don't even have </v>
<v Speaker 1>a name because you know,</v>

195
00:12:49.631 --> 00:12:51.610
<v Speaker 1>you're the battalion commander is </v>
<v Speaker 1>storming the beach of Normandy.</v>

196
00:12:51.611 --> 00:12:52.444
<v Speaker 1>You don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to name every single </v>

197
00:12:53.321 --> 00:12:55.360
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for some reason,</v>

198
00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:59.170
<v Speaker 1>and maybe it's just my experiences of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of being in combat,</v>

199
00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:03.010
<v Speaker 1>when I read about that two sentences of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy,</v>

200
00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:05.860
<v Speaker 1>that that gets shot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that gets killed,</v>

201
00:13:05.861 --> 00:13:06.694
<v Speaker 1>that gets blown up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I completely understand and relate to </v>

202
00:13:11.081 --> 00:13:11.914
<v Speaker 1>that person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>

203
00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:12.783
<v Speaker 1>I don't just see it as me being the guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is always winning and always doing </v>

204
00:13:17.021 --> 00:13:17.854
<v Speaker 1>okay and always surviving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel and relate to those guys that </v>

205
00:13:23.261 --> 00:13:23.741
<v Speaker 1>didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

206
00:13:23.741 --> 00:13:27.730
<v Speaker 1>and part of that is just because of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends that I lost in combat.</v>

207
00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:31.330
<v Speaker 1>Like those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're their people.</v>

208
00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:34.990
<v Speaker 1>And I think that key thing of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of reading it and going,</v>

209
00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:36.610
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every single person,</v>

210
00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:37.473
<v Speaker 1>like when you read about these groups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about millions of people </v>

211
00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:41.830
<v Speaker 1>that were tortured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>died,</v>

212
00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:42.693
<v Speaker 1>murdered.</v>

213
00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:46.570
<v Speaker 1>Every one of those people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keyword is people.</v>

214
00:13:46.571 --> 00:13:51.571
<v Speaker 1>Every one of those people is a person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to your point,</v>

215
00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:54.003
<v Speaker 1>every single one of those executioners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every single one of those murderers is </v>

216
00:13:59.411 --> 00:14:00.340
<v Speaker 1>also a purse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

217
00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:03.070
<v Speaker 1>there's a great book called ordinary </v>
<v Speaker 1>men.</v>

218
00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:03.761
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

219
00:14:03.761 --> 00:14:05.850
<v Speaker 1>we reviewed that on this podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

220
00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:06.701
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

221
00:14:06.701 --> 00:14:07.211
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

222
00:14:07.211 --> 00:14:08.044
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the greatest books written </v>

223
00:14:09.341 --> 00:14:11.770
<v Speaker 1>about what happened in the Second World </v>
<v Speaker 1>War,</v>

224
00:14:11.771 --> 00:14:12.604
<v Speaker 1>I think on the end of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the atrocity and [inaudible] because </v>

225
00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:20.260
<v Speaker 1>the author does such a lovely job of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

226
00:14:20.261 --> 00:14:22.720
<v Speaker 1>it's a strange way of putting it in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>context,</v>

227
00:14:22.721 --> 00:14:23.554
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about this police battalion that </v>

228
00:14:25.361 --> 00:14:28.100
<v Speaker 1>was moved into Poland after the Germans </v>
<v Speaker 1>went through and,</v>

229
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:32.470
<v Speaker 1>and occupied the country and they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>there to establish order like police do,</v>

230
00:14:32.471 --> 00:14:35.500
<v Speaker 1>but also to participate in the mopping </v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

231
00:14:35.501 --> 00:14:36.790
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

232
00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:39.160
<v Speaker 1>that was part and parcel of the war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

233
00:14:39.161 --> 00:14:41.610
<v Speaker 1>these were ordinary policemen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

234
00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:42.763
<v Speaker 1>middleclass guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of whom had been educated and </v>

235
00:14:45.341 --> 00:14:49.780
<v Speaker 1>socialized before the Nazi propaganda </v>
<v Speaker 1>machine really got rolling.</v>

236
00:14:49.781 --> 00:14:52.280
<v Speaker 1>So they weren't like Hitler youth types.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

237
00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:58.660
<v Speaker 3>they were ordinary men and they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>brought and they had a commander who had</v>

238
00:15:00.171 --> 00:15:01.004
<v Speaker 3>made an explicit case that if they </v>
<v Speaker 3>weren't able to tolerate the conditions </v>

239
00:15:06.501 --> 00:15:07.334
<v Speaker 3>in Poland that they could go home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there was no top down order that you </v>

240
00:15:11.121 --> 00:15:14.750
<v Speaker 3>had to do this or else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they were,</v>

241
00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:15.973
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all they started rounding up </v>

242
00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:20.990
<v Speaker 3>while mostly Jewish people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>men between 18 and 65 and then,</v>

243
00:15:20.991 --> 00:15:21.824
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they started to participate in the </v>

244
00:15:22.611 --> 00:15:23.444
<v Speaker 3>entire atrocious mess and they were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they ended up many of them taking naked </v>

245
00:15:27.561 --> 00:15:30.510
<v Speaker 3>pregnant women out into fields and </v>
<v Speaker 3>shooting them in the back of the head.</v>

246
00:15:30.511 --> 00:15:35.511
<v Speaker 3>And what the author does is outline how </v>
<v Speaker 3>that happens to you,</v>

247
00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:38.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one step at a time.</v>

248
00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:43.010
<v Speaker 3>And so it's a really horrifying book and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a brilliant book because there's no</v>

249
00:15:43.011 --> 00:15:48.011
<v Speaker 3>attempt to make the perpetrators like </v>
<v Speaker 3>some creatures that aren't human,</v>

250
00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:50.420
<v Speaker 3>like just pure psychopath.</v>

251
00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:54.280
<v Speaker 3>And of course in in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in an situation like Nazi Germany and,</v>

252
00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:57.230
<v Speaker 3>and in the horrors of the communist </v>
<v Speaker 3>states,</v>

253
00:15:57.530 --> 00:16:00.290
<v Speaker 3>there was no shortage of places for </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychopaths to prevail.</v>

254
00:16:00.291 --> 00:16:02.450
<v Speaker 3>But that's not really the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The issue is,</v>

255
00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:03.913
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how does an ordinary person come to </v>

256
00:16:06.891 --> 00:16:09.710
<v Speaker 3>participate in a global horror,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say?</v>

257
00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:12.260
<v Speaker 3>And what does that mean about being an </v>
<v Speaker 3>ordinary person?</v>

258
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:13.850
<v Speaker 3>And then the next question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

259
00:16:13.851 --> 00:16:17.030
<v Speaker 3>what does it mean about how you should </v>
<v Speaker 3>conduct your life?</v>

260
00:16:17.031 --> 00:16:19.280
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

261
00:16:19.281 --> 00:16:20.114
<v Speaker 3>I think what happened to me when I read </v>
<v Speaker 3>all this material in the 80s was that I </v>

262
00:16:25.491 --> 00:16:26.324
<v Speaker 3>became convinced that there wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything more important to do in the </v>

263
00:16:30.381 --> 00:16:35.381
<v Speaker 3>aftermath of what had happened in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>20th century than to try to build people</v>

264
00:16:35.691 --> 00:16:39.800
<v Speaker 3>who were responsible enough as truth </v>
<v Speaker 3>telling courageous,</v>

265
00:16:39.801 --> 00:16:44.801
<v Speaker 3>responsible citizens so that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>probability would increase,</v>

266
00:16:45.351 --> 00:16:48.020
<v Speaker 3>that if they were in a position to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>a terrible choice,</v>

267
00:16:48.021 --> 00:16:49.610
<v Speaker 3>that they would make the right one.</v>

268
00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:52.760
<v Speaker 3>And I would say this lecture tour that </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing,</v>

269
00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:56.660
<v Speaker 3>which has now extended over more than a </v>
<v Speaker 3>hundred cities,</v>

270
00:16:57.530 --> 00:16:59.360
<v Speaker 3>is an extension of the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

271
00:16:59.361 --> 00:17:01.790
<v Speaker 3>I think it's the same thing that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to do with your book.</v>

272
00:17:01.791 --> 00:17:04.580
<v Speaker 3>Like we were just looking at your Mickey</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the dragons book,</v>

273
00:17:04.581 --> 00:17:07.130
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you're trying to lay out,</v>

274
00:17:07.570 --> 00:17:08.860
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

275
00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:11.840
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychological pathway that guides people</v>

276
00:17:11.841 --> 00:17:15.560
<v Speaker 3>towards responsibility and courage and </v>
<v Speaker 3>truth and all of that.</v>

277
00:17:15.561 --> 00:17:18.980
<v Speaker 3>And that is the bulwark against tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's actually the,</v>

278
00:17:19.070 --> 00:17:22.560
<v Speaker 3>it's actually at the individual level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we kind of know that we,</v>

279
00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:23.723
<v Speaker 3>we know that in the West.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's part of the core ethos </v>

280
00:17:25.731 --> 00:17:26.564
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well certainly that of the English </v>

281
00:17:28.611 --> 00:17:29.444
<v Speaker 3>common law system certainly of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the American way of looking at the </v>

282
00:17:32.571 --> 00:17:36.440
<v Speaker 3>world is that each citizen is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bulwark against tyranny.</v>

283
00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:39.260
<v Speaker 3>And that's actually true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

284
00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:41.450
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's a terrible thing to,</v>

285
00:17:41.451 --> 00:17:46.451
<v Speaker 3>to think through because it means that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you are responsible for the integrity or</v>

286
00:17:47.631 --> 00:17:49.280
<v Speaker 3>lack thereof of your state.</v>

287
00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:50.700
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's on you,</v>

288
00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:51.831
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

289
00:17:51.831 --> 00:17:52.664
<v Speaker 3>and there's something great about that </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it means that your existence </v>

290
00:17:55.771 --> 00:18:00.771
<v Speaker 3>actually matters to you and to your </v>
<v Speaker 3>family and to the broader community in a</v>

291
00:18:01.051 --> 00:18:01.884
<v Speaker 3>really major way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a way that's much more significant </v>

292
00:18:04.981 --> 00:18:07.500
<v Speaker 3>than you might think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that the,</v>

293
00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:08.663
<v Speaker 3>your proclivity to abdicate your moral </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibility echoes way farther than </v>

294
00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:17.250
<v Speaker 3>you might consider,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially under some circumstances,</v>

295
00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:18.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and soldier Nitsa.</v>

296
00:18:18.441 --> 00:18:19.274
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things that's so amazing </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the Gulag archipelago is his </v>

297
00:18:21.871 --> 00:18:22.704
<v Speaker 3>stories not only of the absolute bloody </v>
<v Speaker 3>catastrophe of the Soviet state and his </v>

298
00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:33.830
<v Speaker 3>incredibly astute documentation of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>role that the utopian,</v>

299
00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:36.533
<v Speaker 3>political and philosophical assumptions </v>
<v Speaker 3>of Marxism played in creating the </v>

300
00:18:40.111 --> 00:18:40.741
<v Speaker 3>system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

301
00:18:40.741 --> 00:18:42.870
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't an aberration,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a direct,</v>

302
00:18:42.871 --> 00:18:45.960
<v Speaker 3>logical consequence of that collectivist</v>
<v Speaker 3>viewpoint.</v>

303
00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:47.213
<v Speaker 3>And to document all that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also to tell endless stories about </v>

304
00:18:50.581 --> 00:18:53.310
<v Speaker 3>people who were able,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least to some degree,</v>

305
00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:54.413
<v Speaker 3>to not become corrupted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even under unbelievably horrific </v>

306
00:18:58.741 --> 00:19:00.390
<v Speaker 3>conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

307
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:01.980
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's something you also get out of</v>

308
00:19:01.981 --> 00:19:04.050
<v Speaker 3>Viktor Frankl's book man's search for </v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning,</v>

309
00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:05.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>

310
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:06.833
<v Speaker 3>and so the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Gulag archipelago is a story about </v>

311
00:19:10.201 --> 00:19:11.034
<v Speaker 3>horror in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's more a story of the triumph of </v>

312
00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:18.090
<v Speaker 3>the fundamental triumph of the human </v>
<v Speaker 3>spirit and perhaps no more,</v>

313
00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:19.963
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>perhaps most evident in the case of </v>

314
00:19:22.741 --> 00:19:26.310
<v Speaker 3>soldier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's an himself because he memorized</v>

315
00:19:26.311 --> 00:19:27.144
<v Speaker 3>this book in some sense while he was in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the camps and then wrote it under </v>

316
00:19:29.881 --> 00:19:33.450
<v Speaker 3>extreme duress afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's an immense undertaking and it's</v>

317
00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:36.420
<v Speaker 3>unbelievably emotionally intense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The entire book.</v>

318
00:19:36.421 --> 00:19:37.830
<v Speaker 3>It's like one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

319
00:19:37.831 --> 00:19:38.664
<v Speaker 3>1700 page scream of outrage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just can hardly believe that someone </v>

320
00:19:42.661 --> 00:19:47.490
<v Speaker 3>can write at that white hot intensity </v>
<v Speaker 3>for such a long period of time.</v>

321
00:19:47.491 --> 00:19:48.324
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his book had an unbelievable global </v>

322
00:19:51.901 --> 00:19:52.734
<v Speaker 3>impact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's sold 30 million copies and </v>

323
00:19:55.441 --> 00:19:58.620
<v Speaker 3>it definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for at least a reasonable period of time</v>

324
00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:02.070
<v Speaker 3>made it completely untenable for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

325
00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:03.203
<v Speaker 3>utopian resentful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Utopian intellectuals to ethically </v>

326
00:20:07.051 --> 00:20:10.170
<v Speaker 3>justified their radical leftist </v>
<v Speaker 3>collectivism.</v>

327
00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:11.293
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just blew the slats out from </v>

328
00:20:12.811 --> 00:20:16.440
<v Speaker 3>underneath any ethical credibility that </v>
<v Speaker 3>communism,</v>

329
00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:17.723
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that remained of the communist doctrine </v>

330
00:20:19.351 --> 00:20:20.184
<v Speaker 3>by the 1970s and that that's a hell of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing for someone to manage on their </v>

331
00:20:23.311 --> 00:20:24.144
<v Speaker 3>own.</v>

332
00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:26.890
<v Speaker 1>Pretty big task.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

333
00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:30.470
<v Speaker 1>so while you were going through that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking myself,</v>

334
00:20:30.471 --> 00:20:35.270
<v Speaker 1>so as I was talking to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still talk to military folks and I was</v>

335
00:20:35.271 --> 00:20:38.540
<v Speaker 1>talking to some military leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>young leaders,</v>

336
00:20:38.541 --> 00:20:41.960
<v Speaker 1>so like platoon level and company level </v>
<v Speaker 1>leaders.</v>

337
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:43.940
<v Speaker 1>So these are guys that are in charge of </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

338
00:20:43.941 --> 00:20:48.050
<v Speaker 1>40 guys or maybe 150 guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

339
00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:51.760
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can have some real ethical problems.</v>

340
00:20:51.761 --> 00:20:52.594
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things that I said to </v>

341
00:20:53.501 --> 00:20:57.790
<v Speaker 1>this group was I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

342
00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:02.820
<v Speaker 1>in your s in your platoon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got a murderer in your platoon,</v>

343
00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:07.360
<v Speaker 1>you've got someone in your platoon that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a sadist.</v>

344
00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:10.600
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were kind of looking at me,</v>

345
00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:13.210
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suspect,</v>

346
00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:14.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit like,</v>

347
00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:16.480
<v Speaker 1>oh come on now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>

348
00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:19.690
<v Speaker 1>What are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How big is the platoon?</v>

349
00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:23.150
<v Speaker 1>A platoon is 40 guys and stuff like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

350
00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:24.213
<v Speaker 1>And I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was actually going to ask you how </v>

351
00:21:24.761 --> 00:21:25.594
<v Speaker 1>accurate I was and then I was going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually say that no matter what you </v>

352
00:21:28.091 --> 00:21:30.210
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how accurate is even if it was,</v>

353
00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:31.870
<v Speaker 1>even if it was one out of every </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand,</v>

354
00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:32.793
<v Speaker 1>you have to act as a leader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as if in your platoon you've got one of </v>

355
00:21:35.501 --> 00:21:38.230
<v Speaker 1>those guys are two of those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a way you need to look.</v>

356
00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:42.160
<v Speaker 1>And there's another book called the Rape</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Nan King.</v>

357
00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:43.203
<v Speaker 1>We've covered that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that was really </v>

358
00:21:46.421 --> 00:21:49.630
<v Speaker 1>horrifying about that book is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so imagine that there's maybe,</v>

359
00:21:49.631 --> 00:21:50.464
<v Speaker 1>let's say that there's one in a hundred </v>
<v Speaker 1>just for the sake of argument that's </v>

360
00:21:52.871 --> 00:21:55.700
<v Speaker 1>really got cruel and psychopathic </v>
<v Speaker 1>traits.</v>

361
00:21:55.701 --> 00:21:57.160
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think professionally?</v>

362
00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:58.173
<v Speaker 1>What do you think that number is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think 1% isn't unreasonable and it </v>

363
00:22:01.241 --> 00:22:02.390
<v Speaker 1>could be higher than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

364
00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:03.770
<v Speaker 1>there's gradations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

365
00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:04.783
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's probably in a group of 40 </v>

366
00:22:05.291 --> 00:22:06.124
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be one guy in there </v>

367
00:22:07.181 --> 00:22:08.014
<v Speaker 1>who's proclivity in that direction is </v>
<v Speaker 1>sufficiently strong so that you better </v>

368
00:22:12.221 --> 00:22:13.990
<v Speaker 1>keep an eye on him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

369
00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:16.840
<v Speaker 1>And this is a group of people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>joined the military,</v>

370
00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:17.860
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're already,</v>

371
00:22:17.861 --> 00:22:18.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've already gotten,</v>

372
00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:20.620
<v Speaker 1>you've already got a group that's okay </v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

373
00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:23.260
<v Speaker 1>with theoretically having to kill other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

374
00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:24.190
<v Speaker 1>So this is probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

375
00:22:24.191 --> 00:22:28.240
<v Speaker 1>so if it's 100 islands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's likely an underestimate.</v>

376
00:22:28.241 --> 00:22:32.350
<v Speaker 1>So I think your estimate is perfectly </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable and it might be conservative.</v>

377
00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:33.713
<v Speaker 1>What happened in Nan king was that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most sadistic people became the targets </v>

378
00:22:38.021 --> 00:22:42.190
<v Speaker 1>of imitation and emulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's when things really get out of</v>

379
00:22:42.191 --> 00:22:42.940
<v Speaker 1>hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

380
00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:43.750
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

381
00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:46.140
<v Speaker 1>and that's the same thing to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lai massacre and,</v>

382
00:22:46.141 --> 00:22:46.880
<v Speaker 1>and that was it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

383
00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:49.510
<v Speaker 1>so when I was talking to this group and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting it,</v>

384
00:22:49.511 --> 00:22:51.010
<v Speaker 1>I said to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

385
00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:52.720
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at me like right now.</v>

386
00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:53.411
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

387
00:22:53.411 --> 00:22:54.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It like I'm crazy.</v>

388
00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:58.480
<v Speaker 1>Who knows about the mee Lai massacre </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

389
00:22:58.530 --> 00:22:59.363
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden it got quiet because if </v>

390
00:23:00.401 --> 00:23:01.810
<v Speaker 1>you know anything about the mee Lai </v>
<v Speaker 1>massacre,</v>

391
00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:06.850
<v Speaker 1>it was a normal group of guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a normal group of guys.</v>

392
00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:08.710
<v Speaker 1>It was a normal company of American </v>
<v Speaker 1>soldiers.</v>

393
00:23:08.711 --> 00:23:09.544
<v Speaker 1>And you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd been through some stress they'd </v>

394
00:23:11.081 --> 00:23:11.910
<v Speaker 1>been through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

395
00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:12.743
<v Speaker 1>they'd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd had their friends killed and it </v>

396
00:23:13.331 --> 00:23:15.700
<v Speaker 1>was in Vietnam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no one really to react against</v>

397
00:23:15.701 --> 00:23:16.151
<v Speaker 1>or to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

398
00:23:16.151 --> 00:23:18.310
<v Speaker 1>to take your aggression out on because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the enemy,</v>

399
00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:20.080
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't see them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would hide.</v>

400
00:23:20.081 --> 00:23:23.470
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then they turned and they snapped.</v>

401
00:23:23.471 --> 00:23:25.830
<v Speaker 1>And the same thing you had the leader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

402
00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:30.220
<v Speaker 1>a guy named lieutenant calley who was </v>
<v Speaker 1>the platoon leader who eat,</v>

403
00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:31.123
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd love for you to do a psychological </v>

404
00:23:31.961 --> 00:23:32.794
<v Speaker 1>profile media who used one of these guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was kind of like it was it totally </v>

405
00:23:35.831 --> 00:23:36.730
<v Speaker 1>insecure about everything.</v>

406
00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:40.180
<v Speaker 1>And so he got those shoulder boards on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the way,</v>

407
00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:42.590
<v Speaker 1>which is the way Solzhenitsyn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he describes his,</v>

408
00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:46.070
<v Speaker 1>his experience as being a platoon leader</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what it did to him.</v>

409
00:23:46.071 --> 00:23:48.770
<v Speaker 1>And he goes through that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This book is fantastic to hear.</v>

410
00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:52.730
<v Speaker 1>When he talks about what he did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he knew he was looking back saying,</v>

411
00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:53.593
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did this and I didn't listen to this </v>

412
00:23:54.621 --> 00:23:58.280
<v Speaker 1>little rampage of things that he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how he acted as a commander.</v>

413
00:23:58.790 --> 00:23:59.623
<v Speaker 1>I ate the food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the good food right in front of my guys </v>

414
00:24:01.161 --> 00:24:01.994
<v Speaker 1>when they weren't getting for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was getting the good food and he did </v>

415
00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:04.633
<v Speaker 1>took advantage of all the little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the little comforts that you got </v>

416
00:24:07.011 --> 00:24:08.740
<v Speaker 1>being an officer and you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

417
00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:10.780
<v Speaker 3>well he was trying and in the whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>book,</v>

418
00:24:10.930 --> 00:24:14.170
<v Speaker 3>and especially in that section,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I think is in volume two,</v>

419
00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:16.780
<v Speaker 3>which I think is the greatest of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>three volumes,</v>

420
00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:19.870
<v Speaker 3>especially the last half of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is just absolutely,</v>

421
00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:23.830
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's genius level writing,</v>

422
00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:27.280
<v Speaker 3>unbelievably compelling and brilliant </v>
<v Speaker 3>and yeah,</v>

423
00:24:27.281 --> 00:24:28.114
<v Speaker 3>I mean he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said that when he was in the camps </v>

424
00:24:29.831 --> 00:24:30.664
<v Speaker 3>that one of the things that he did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially once he started to identify </v>

425
00:24:34.001 --> 00:24:34.834
<v Speaker 3>people that he truly admired,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was to go over his life with a fine </v>

426
00:24:38.501 --> 00:24:39.334
<v Speaker 3>tooth comb and try to try to remember </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything that he did wrong by his own </v>

427
00:24:45.011 --> 00:24:45.844
<v Speaker 3>estimation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then try to set it right in some </v>

428
00:24:48.041 --> 00:24:49.180
<v Speaker 3>manner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so there was a,</v>

429
00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:51.370
<v Speaker 3>that's a repentance and then a </v>
<v Speaker 3>redemption,</v>

430
00:24:51.371 --> 00:24:51.781
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

431
00:24:51.781 --> 00:24:53.770
<v Speaker 3>there's a real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a real fundamental,</v>

432
00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:56.740
<v Speaker 3>like a medieval Christian undertone to </v>
<v Speaker 3>all of that.</v>

433
00:24:56.741 --> 00:24:57.574
<v Speaker 3>But it was one of the things that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>quite interesting is that when you talk </v>

434
00:25:00.731 --> 00:25:01.564
<v Speaker 3>about issues that are this serious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're almost inevitably in a situation </v>

435
00:25:06.731 --> 00:25:07.564
<v Speaker 3>where you're going to find yourself </v>
<v Speaker 3>compelled to use some kind of quasi </v>

436
00:25:10.241 --> 00:25:13.590
<v Speaker 3>religious language because you end up </v>
<v Speaker 3>discussing good and evil and,</v>

437
00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:14.523
<v Speaker 3>and issues of redemption in issues of </v>
<v Speaker 3>repentance and issues of conscience and </v>

438
00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:19.150
<v Speaker 3>sin and all of that.</v>

439
00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:21.740
<v Speaker 3>There isn't language that's deep enough </v>
<v Speaker 3>to get at it otherwise.</v>

440
00:25:21.741 --> 00:25:22.574
<v Speaker 3>And what Solzhenitsyn did was scour his </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscience and try to put himself </v>

441
00:25:27.431 --> 00:25:32.200
<v Speaker 3>together partly because he was shamed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was ashamed of himself in the face of</v>

442
00:25:32.201 --> 00:25:36.340
<v Speaker 3>these extraordinarily extraordinary </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who seem to be able to keep their</v>

443
00:25:36.341 --> 00:25:37.174
<v Speaker 3>moral compass under circumstances where </v>
<v Speaker 3>no one should ever assume that they </v>

444
00:25:41.441 --> 00:25:44.200
<v Speaker 3>would keep their moral compass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because certainly,</v>

445
00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:46.060
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was reading this,</v>

446
00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:47.313
<v Speaker 3>the Gulag and other books like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never assumed that if I was in those </v>

447
00:25:50.741 --> 00:25:54.220
<v Speaker 3>situations that I would have been one of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people who kept their head.</v>

448
00:25:54.221 --> 00:25:59.221
<v Speaker 3>And we're able to withstand the </v>
<v Speaker 3>temptation to become a trustee,</v>

449
00:25:59.591 --> 00:26:00.424
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and to take things the easy way and to </v>

450
00:26:01.871 --> 00:26:06.550
<v Speaker 3>Lord it over the other prisoners and to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and to adopt that position of authority.</v>

451
00:26:06.551 --> 00:26:07.270
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

452
00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:10.660
<v Speaker 3>it's like a head slave among slaves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

453
00:26:10.661 --> 00:26:12.820
<v Speaker 3>you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well better to be the head slave than to</v>

454
00:26:12.821 --> 00:26:13.840
<v Speaker 3>be the bottom slave.</v>

455
00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:17.320
<v Speaker 3>And while that's true in some sense with</v>
<v Speaker 3>regards to creature comfort,</v>

456
00:26:17.321 --> 00:26:19.600
<v Speaker 3>but as Solzhenitsyn point out points </v>
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>

457
00:26:19.601 --> 00:26:21.520
<v Speaker 3>it might be a little bit hard on your </v>
<v Speaker 3>soul.</v>

458
00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:23.670
<v Speaker 3>And that actually turns out to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>something of,</v>

459
00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:26.500
<v Speaker 3>of crucial,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not only crucial,</v>

460
00:26:26.501 --> 00:26:27.334
<v Speaker 3>important psychologically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but crucial importance sociologically </v>

461
00:26:30.161 --> 00:26:32.860
<v Speaker 3>and politically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because if you sacrifice that,</v>

462
00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:33.723
<v Speaker 3>then you work the structure around you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is exactly what happened in the </v>

463
00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:38.760
<v Speaker 3>establishment of these camps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

464
00:26:38.761 --> 00:26:39.594
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

465
00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:44.220
<v Speaker 3>the Soviet Union was just one big lie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was their old joke?</v>

466
00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:47.250
<v Speaker 3>They pretend to pay us and we pretend to</v>
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>

467
00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:48.593
<v Speaker 3>It's like</v>

468
00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:50.340
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole,</v>

469
00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:53.460
<v Speaker 1>the whole book and the whole Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 1>Union.</v>

470
00:26:53.461 --> 00:26:55.080
<v Speaker 1>When you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you read about it now,</v>

471
00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:58.520
<v Speaker 1>it seems like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like a bad joke.</v>

472
00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:01.110
<v Speaker 1>It seems like a bad movie you could with</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the way,</v>

473
00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:04.490
<v Speaker 1>the way that Stalin would do something </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

474
00:27:04.491 --> 00:27:05.930
<v Speaker 1>and the way that that order would come </v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

475
00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:08.130
<v Speaker 1>It seems like one of those cheesy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

476
00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:09.023
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedic movies about these decisions </v>

477
00:27:11.041 --> 00:27:14.760
<v Speaker 1>that they're making and it's surreal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's completely,</v>

478
00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:16.440
<v Speaker 1>it's completely insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

479
00:27:16.441 --> 00:27:19.070
<v Speaker 1>at one point he's talking about the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a,</v>

480
00:27:19.071 --> 00:27:22.800
<v Speaker 1>a new penalty for when they call it sh </v>
<v Speaker 1>clipping corn or,</v>

481
00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:23.693
<v Speaker 1>or they're basically a 12 year old kid </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be starving and you'd go into a </v>

482
00:27:27.181 --> 00:27:29.660
<v Speaker 1>field of wheat and clip a cure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>

483
00:27:29.661 --> 00:27:31.380
<v Speaker 1>a core,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an ear of corn.</v>

484
00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:33.403
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That happened in the Ukraine during the </v>

485
00:27:33.981 --> 00:27:35.300
<v Speaker 3>dq localization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

486
00:27:35.301 --> 00:27:38.240
<v Speaker 3>It was against the law to go out after </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fields were,</v>

487
00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:39.463
<v Speaker 3>were harvested.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was against the law to go out and </v>

488
00:27:41.841 --> 00:27:44.120
<v Speaker 3>pick grain off the ground to feed your </v>
<v Speaker 3>family.</v>

489
00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:44.920
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

490
00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:47.110
<v Speaker 1>And the prison sentence was like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tenor,</v>

491
00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:49.760
<v Speaker 1>which is their little word for 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're going to get you,</v>

492
00:27:49.761 --> 00:27:54.640
<v Speaker 1>you steal a piece of corn or you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>picked up corn off the ground and you're</v>

493
00:27:54.641 --> 00:27:55.720
<v Speaker 1>getting 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

494
00:27:55.870 --> 00:28:00.210
<v Speaker 1>You can't comprehend that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very hard to conation.</v>

495
00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:01.700
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Worked.</v>

496
00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:04.450
<v Speaker 1>And they were the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

497
00:28:04.451 --> 00:28:06.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he does in the earlier parts of the book</v>

498
00:28:06.641 --> 00:28:09.670
<v Speaker 1>when he starts going through the trials </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they were doing on people,</v>

499
00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:13.490
<v Speaker 1>it's completely crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>King Kong,</v>

500
00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:14.693
<v Speaker 3>CAFCA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's why I hate to see the </v>

501
00:28:16.581 --> 00:28:19.760
<v Speaker 3>kangaroo courts emerging all over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all over the west,</v>

502
00:28:19.761 --> 00:28:20.151
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

503
00:28:20.151 --> 00:28:20.984
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and with the university sort of at the </v>

504
00:28:21.921 --> 00:28:23.510
<v Speaker 3>forefront of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're,</v>

505
00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:24.383
<v Speaker 3>we're building these alternative court </v>
<v Speaker 3>systems constantly that don't follow </v>

506
00:28:27.201 --> 00:28:29.090
<v Speaker 3>standard legal procedure and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

507
00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:33.110
<v Speaker 3>we're messing with things that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we shouldn't be messing with.</v>

508
00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:34.550
<v Speaker 3>And Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole,</v>

509
00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:35.653
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are,</v>

510
00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:38.270
<v Speaker 3>there are accounts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe it's in the Gulag of,</v>

511
00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:40.720
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of applause after Astellas,</v>

512
00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:42.470
<v Speaker 3>the speech,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

513
00:28:42.471 --> 00:28:45.080
<v Speaker 3>Where people would stand up and applaud </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they,</v>

514
00:28:45.081 --> 00:28:45.914
<v Speaker 3>and they'd applaud until,</v>
<v Speaker 3>until literally the old people were </v>

515
00:28:47.991 --> 00:28:48.824
<v Speaker 3>falling over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because if you were the first person to </v>

516
00:28:50.301 --> 00:28:52.190
<v Speaker 3>stop applauding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you were,</v>

517
00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:54.170
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was off to the camps with you.</v>

518
00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:55.320
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he absolutely outlines.</v>

519
00:28:55.321 --> 00:28:56.154
<v Speaker 1>So that sounds so crazy to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he outlines a specific thing that </v>

520
00:29:01.261 --> 00:29:02.490
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that right there?</v>

521
00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:05.030
<v Speaker 1>These no one will stop applauding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

522
00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:08.270
<v Speaker 1>because they're afraid they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get ratted out by there.</v>

523
00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:09.360
<v Speaker 1>By,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by everyone else.</v>

524
00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:10.253
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well Ben and by the people who are in </v>

525
00:29:11.371 --> 00:29:12.750
<v Speaker 3>fact watching.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I mean,</v>

526
00:29:12.751 --> 00:29:14.550
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by by the end,</v>

527
00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:15.330
<v Speaker 3>by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the,</v>

528
00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:16.163
<v Speaker 3>by the collapse of East Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one third of the people were in fort </v>

529
00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:20.543
<v Speaker 3>informers for the state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so if you had a family of six </v>

530
00:29:22.771 --> 00:29:23.604
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two of your family members were direct </v>

531
00:29:25.741 --> 00:29:27.910
<v Speaker 3>government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Informers you know,</v>

532
00:29:27.911 --> 00:29:28.711
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

533
00:29:28.711 --> 00:29:29.460
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

534
00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:30.293
<v Speaker 3>it's creepy in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very weak word to use in this </v>

535
00:29:33.901 --> 00:29:34.930
<v Speaker 3>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'll go,</v>

536
00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:38.670
<v Speaker 3>when I was at New York University </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking to Jonathan Heit about,</v>

537
00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:40.590
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was about few months ago,</v>

538
00:29:41.210 --> 00:29:42.043
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just wrote that book called the </v>

539
00:29:43.091 --> 00:29:44.900
<v Speaker 3>coddling of the American mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

540
00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:46.023
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he took me into one of the men's </v>

541
00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:49.083
<v Speaker 3>washroom stair and there was a poster on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the wall asking students to turn each </v>

542
00:29:52.931 --> 00:29:57.430
<v Speaker 3>other in four instances of bias or </v>
<v Speaker 3>offensive speech.</v>

543
00:29:57.430 --> 00:29:58.263
<v Speaker 3>And they have a whole bureaucracy that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>designed to do nothing else but </v>

544
00:30:02.290 --> 00:30:05.440
<v Speaker 3>adjudicate these instances of biased </v>
<v Speaker 3>speech.</v>

545
00:30:05.441 --> 00:30:09.580
<v Speaker 3>And these posters are up on the walls as</v>
<v Speaker 3>if this is something to be proud of.</v>

546
00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:10.743
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the same thing is happening now in </v>

547
00:30:11.921 --> 00:30:15.250
<v Speaker 3>Scotland with the Scottish police are </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing exactly the same thing.</v>

548
00:30:15.251 --> 00:30:18.220
<v Speaker 3>They're asking citizens to turn each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other in for,</v>

549
00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:19.900
<v Speaker 3>for hate crimes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

550
00:30:19.901 --> 00:30:23.710
<v Speaker 3>And the problem with that is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamental problem with that and the,</v>

551
00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:27.280
<v Speaker 3>the unsolvable problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

552
00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:29.720
<v Speaker 3>who defines hate and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

553
00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:31.660
<v Speaker 3>and where's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where's the line drawn?</v>

554
00:30:31.661 --> 00:30:32.261
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

555
00:30:32.261 --> 00:30:35.560
<v Speaker 3>anything that upsets me that you say is </v>
<v Speaker 3>hate that.</v>

556
00:30:35.561 --> 00:30:39.700
<v Speaker 3>And then it's worse than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like what happens is the people who</v>

557
00:30:39.701 --> 00:30:44.701
<v Speaker 3>define hate ended up being those who are</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking to take offense so that they can</v>

558
00:30:45.401 --> 00:30:46.234
<v Speaker 3>find someone they can define as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>victimizer so that they can persecute </v>

559
00:30:49.481 --> 00:30:53.080
<v Speaker 3>them morally and justify that interstate</v>
<v Speaker 3>ism.</v>

560
00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:54.123
<v Speaker 3>And those are the people who end up </v>
<v Speaker 3>defining the laws and then they match </v>

561
00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:58.270
<v Speaker 3>this with the morality saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

562
00:30:58.271 --> 00:31:00.880
<v Speaker 3>we're doing this to make our society a </v>
<v Speaker 3>safe place.</v>

563
00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:02.720
<v Speaker 3>It's absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

564
00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:03.593
<v Speaker 3>it's absolutely dreadful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And to see that happening in the UK was </v>

565
00:31:06.131 --> 00:31:08.590
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just awful because I mean,</v>

566
00:31:08.591 --> 00:31:10.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the UK is a center,</v>

567
00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:12.610
<v Speaker 3>a center,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the center point of,</v>

568
00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:16.000
<v Speaker 3>of the idea of free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean a lot of America,</v>

569
00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:16.863
<v Speaker 3>obviously a lot of American ideals of </v>
<v Speaker 3>America is a great center of free </v>

570
00:31:19.601 --> 00:31:20.440
<v Speaker 3>speech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean,</v>

571
00:31:20.441 --> 00:31:21.274
<v Speaker 3>it's a variation on the English system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So to see that happening in the UK is </v>

572
00:31:24.791 --> 00:31:26.080
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's awful.</v>

573
00:31:26.081 --> 00:31:28.450
<v Speaker 3>And to see the police doing this and </v>
<v Speaker 3>being,</v>

574
00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:31.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm encouraged by the politicians and,</v>

575
00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:32.813
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

576
00:31:33.010 --> 00:31:36.550
<v Speaker 3>and to see this put forward as some sort</v>
<v Speaker 3>of moral action.</v>

577
00:31:36.551 --> 00:31:37.384
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

578
00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:39.300
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

579
00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:43.250
<v Speaker 1>it's an echo of this kind of catastrophe</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

580
00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:47.820
<v Speaker 1>that we're discussing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think about that sometimes.</v>

581
00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:53.360
<v Speaker 1>And I also have a tendency to look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>things in La,</v>

582
00:31:53.730 --> 00:31:55.500
<v Speaker 1>not be too worried about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

583
00:31:55.501 --> 00:31:56.060
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>c'mon,</v>

584
00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:57.210
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what's really going on?</v>

585
00:31:57.220 --> 00:31:57.691
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

586
00:31:57.691 --> 00:31:58.470
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

587
00:31:58.470 --> 00:31:59.303
<v Speaker 1>that's actually part of my personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of that comes from my old job </v>

588
00:32:01.261 --> 00:32:02.100
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

589
00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:03.760
<v Speaker 1>I can't worry about these little things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

590
00:32:03.761 --> 00:32:05.520
<v Speaker 1>there's some little problem going on </v>
<v Speaker 1>over there.</v>

591
00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:07.770
<v Speaker 1>That's not going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not going to affect us.</v>

592
00:32:07.771 --> 00:32:08.604
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to pay attention a little </v>

593
00:32:09.351 --> 00:32:10.440
<v Speaker 1>bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make sure it doesn't get out of hand.</v>

594
00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:13.140
<v Speaker 1>But that thing about speech and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you just mentioned the,</v>

595
00:32:13.141 --> 00:32:15.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Kulak is that to lax?</v>

596
00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:16.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

597
00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:19.980
<v Speaker 3>They were the Ukrainian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were the Ukrainian farmers who were</v>

598
00:32:19.981 --> 00:32:20.850
<v Speaker 3>good at farming.</v>

599
00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:24.000
<v Speaker 1>When I read this part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

600
00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:25.053
<v Speaker 1>it got me worried about my own personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>lackadaisical attitude towards things </v>

601
00:32:29.921 --> 00:32:31.120
<v Speaker 1>that I think all that's not big of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal.</v>

602
00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:32.093
<v Speaker 1>Let me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me read this little section about </v>

603
00:32:32.891 --> 00:32:33.724
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the escalation of the word Kulak </v>

604
00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:37.300
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

605
00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:40.410
<v Speaker 1>and where it started and where that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

606
00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:42.590
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here we go.</v>

607
00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:45.530
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Russian,</v>

608
00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:46.393
<v Speaker 1>a Kulak is a miserly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dishonest rural trader who grows rich </v>

609
00:32:50.721 --> 00:32:53.240
<v Speaker 1>not by his own labor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but through someone else's.</v>

610
00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:56.013
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

611
00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:58.390
<v Speaker 1>In every locality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even before the revolution.</v>

612
00:32:58.410 --> 00:33:02.870
<v Speaker 1>Such cool acts could be numbered on </v>
<v Speaker 1>one's fingers and the revolution totally</v>

613
00:33:02.871 --> 00:33:06.260
<v Speaker 1>destroyed their basis of activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Subsequently,</v>

614
00:33:06.261 --> 00:33:07.094
<v Speaker 1>after 1917 by a transfer of meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the name Kulak began to be applied to </v>

615
00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:18.520
<v Speaker 1>all those who in any way hired workers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it was only,</v>

616
00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:20.473
<v Speaker 1>even if it was only when they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>temporarily short of working hands in </v>

617
00:33:23.991 --> 00:33:25.280
<v Speaker 1>their own families.</v>

618
00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:30.190
<v Speaker 1>But then that doesn't stop there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The inflation of this scaling.</v>

619
00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:35.200
<v Speaker 1>The term of this scathing term coop </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kulak proceeded relentlessly and by 1930</v>

620
00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:37.303
<v Speaker 1>all strong peasants in general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're being so called all peasants </v>

621
00:33:42.290 --> 00:33:44.600
<v Speaker 1>strong in management,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strong in work,</v>

622
00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:45.523
<v Speaker 1>or even strong merely in convictions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The term Kulak was used to smash the </v>

623
00:33:50.991 --> 00:33:54.860
<v Speaker 1>strength of the peasantry and I got to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to go a little bit further because</v>

624
00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:57.560
<v Speaker 1>hell of a good thing for the workers </v>
<v Speaker 1>party to do.</v>

625
00:33:57.561 --> 00:33:58.790
<v Speaker 1>Aim Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

626
00:33:59.210 --> 00:34:00.043
<v Speaker 1>They went further though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beyond this in every village there were </v>

627
00:34:02.811 --> 00:34:03.644
<v Speaker 1>people who in one way or another had </v>
<v Speaker 1>personally gotten in the way of the </v>

628
00:34:06.681 --> 00:34:08.120
<v Speaker 1>local activists.</v>

629
00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:09.620
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

630
00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:12.920
<v Speaker 1>This was the perfect time to settle </v>
<v Speaker 1>accounts with them of jealousy,</v>

631
00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:13.820
<v Speaker 1>envy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and insult.</v>

632
00:34:13.821 --> 00:34:15.140
<v Speaker 1>These are the people you were just </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>

633
00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:16.783
<v Speaker 1>A new word was needed for these new </v>
<v Speaker 1>victims as a class and it was born by </v>

634
00:34:22.701 --> 00:34:23.534
<v Speaker 1>this time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It had no social or economic content </v>

635
00:34:25.461 --> 00:34:26.294
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it had a marvelous sound pop Kulak </v>

636
00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:31.453
<v Speaker 1>Nick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that meant a person eating the cool </v>

637
00:34:34.391 --> 00:34:35.870
<v Speaker 1>acts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

638
00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:38.870
<v Speaker 1>I consider you an accomplice of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>enemy.</v>

639
00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:40.810
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's all it.</v>

640
00:34:41.130 --> 00:34:41.671
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

641
00:34:41.671 --> 00:34:46.671
<v Speaker 3>one of the things I tried to outline in </v>
<v Speaker 3>my forward to the abridged version was I</v>

642
00:34:47.761 --> 00:34:51.510
<v Speaker 3>was thinking about this idea of oddly </v>
<v Speaker 3>enough,</v>

643
00:34:51.511 --> 00:34:53.250
<v Speaker 3>about intersectionality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

644
00:34:53.251 --> 00:34:55.410
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like social justice idea.</v>

645
00:34:55.411 --> 00:34:56.244
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the social justice ideas that were </v>

646
00:34:58.681 --> 00:34:59.514
<v Speaker 3>best defined by our collective identity </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that the proper narrative in </v>

647
00:35:03.541 --> 00:35:06.810
<v Speaker 3>relationship to our collective identity </v>
<v Speaker 3>is one of victim victimizer,</v>

648
00:35:06.811 --> 00:35:11.160
<v Speaker 3>which is a replay of the old Marxist </v>
<v Speaker 3>doctrine of bourgeoisie and proletariat.</v>

649
00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:14.020
<v Speaker 3>It's just in its new guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

650
00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:16.560
<v Speaker 3>I mean in that new guys developed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least in part,</v>

651
00:35:16.590 --> 00:35:17.423
<v Speaker 3>in response to the Gulag archipelago </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the old proletariat bourgeoisie </v>

652
00:35:20.971 --> 00:35:21.804
<v Speaker 3>distinction became morally untenable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it just went underground and </v>

653
00:35:24.601 --> 00:35:25.434
<v Speaker 3>underwent this transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The intersectional theorists point out </v>

654
00:35:27.961 --> 00:35:28.794
<v Speaker 3>that your status as a victimizer or a </v>
<v Speaker 3>victim is actually the intersection of </v>

655
00:35:33.511 --> 00:35:36.060
<v Speaker 3>your multiple identities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

656
00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:40.110
<v Speaker 3>and that's actually the Achilles heel of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the collectivist notion.</v>

657
00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:40.943
<v Speaker 3>And we can get into why that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a horror that goes along </v>

658
00:35:43.861 --> 00:35:44.700
<v Speaker 3>with that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that people,</v>

659
00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:45.863
<v Speaker 3>that's not obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I think contributed to exactly why </v>

660
00:35:48.931 --> 00:35:51.120
<v Speaker 3>the Russian revolution went so horribly </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong.</v>

661
00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:55.140
<v Speaker 3>And that is that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So imagine that I could characterize you</v>

662
00:35:55.141 --> 00:35:58.560
<v Speaker 3>along five or six different dimensions </v>
<v Speaker 3>of group identity.</v>

663
00:35:58.561 --> 00:36:00.180
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And while you're male,</v>

664
00:36:00.181 --> 00:36:01.014
<v Speaker 3>you're male of a certain age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're male of a certain age and </v>

665
00:36:03.091 --> 00:36:05.070
<v Speaker 3>economic class,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

666
00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:08.040
<v Speaker 3>you have a certain sexual orientation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a certain ethnicity,</v>

667
00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:10.860
<v Speaker 3>you have a certain race that's six </v>
<v Speaker 3>groups right there.</v>

668
00:36:10.861 --> 00:36:13.110
<v Speaker 3>And we could continue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

669
00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:16.890
<v Speaker 3>your parents had a certain socioeconomic</v>
<v Speaker 3>class and so did your grandparents,</v>

670
00:36:17.310 --> 00:36:20.770
<v Speaker 3>and then your ethnic group had a certain</v>
<v Speaker 3>privilege or lack thereof,</v>

671
00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:21.623
<v Speaker 3>then you're attractive or you're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>attractive and you're intelligent or </v>

672
00:36:23.851 --> 00:36:25.440
<v Speaker 3>you're not intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's temple men,</v>

673
00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:26.840
<v Speaker 3>temperamental variability.</v>

674
00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:27.863
<v Speaker 3>Like there's all sorts of ways of </v>
<v Speaker 3>characterizing you according to your </v>

675
00:36:30.001 --> 00:36:30.990
<v Speaker 3>group.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

676
00:36:30.991 --> 00:36:31.824
<v Speaker 3>Now we might say that if we were </v>
<v Speaker 3>compassionate people that we would take </v>

677
00:36:35.491 --> 00:36:36.324
<v Speaker 3>one of those group identities are more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and look at where your dispossessed and </v>

678
00:36:40.381 --> 00:36:41.790
<v Speaker 3>victimized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

679
00:36:41.791 --> 00:36:42.624
<v Speaker 3>And we're gonna find some dimension </v>
<v Speaker 3>along which are less privileged than </v>

680
00:36:46.381 --> 00:36:48.480
<v Speaker 3>some people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like maybe you come from a working class</v>

681
00:36:48.481 --> 00:36:51.390
<v Speaker 3>background despite the fact that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a straight male.</v>

682
00:36:51.391 --> 00:36:53.730
<v Speaker 3>And so you can be a victim on that </v>
<v Speaker 3>dimension.</v>

683
00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:54.923
<v Speaker 3>And so that's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's at least in part an element of </v>

684
00:36:59.731 --> 00:37:01.290
<v Speaker 3>intersectional theory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

685
00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:03.400
<v Speaker 3>And that may be your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

686
00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:08.620
<v Speaker 3>your oppression is the product of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of your multiple victim,</v>

687
00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:10.133
<v Speaker 3>like identities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that can easily be reversed because </v>

688
00:37:13.411 --> 00:37:14.244
<v Speaker 3>it's absolutely the case that I can take</v>
<v Speaker 3>any person and I can do add </v>

689
00:37:17.901 --> 00:37:18.734
<v Speaker 3>multidimensional analysis of their group</v>
<v Speaker 3>identities and I can find at least one </v>

690
00:37:21.991 --> 00:37:23.970
<v Speaker 3>dimension along which there the </v>
<v Speaker 3>perpetrator,</v>

691
00:37:23.971 --> 00:37:26.100
<v Speaker 3>not the victim,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're the victimizer,</v>

692
00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:27.060
<v Speaker 3>not the victim.</v>

693
00:37:27.330 --> 00:37:28.163
<v Speaker 3>And as soon as I can identify a </v>
<v Speaker 3>dimension along which there a </v>

694
00:37:30.001 --> 00:37:32.730
<v Speaker 3>victimizer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then that justifies their persecution.</v>

695
00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:35.880
<v Speaker 3>And so one of the things that you saw </v>
<v Speaker 3>happening in the Russian revolution,</v>

696
00:37:35.881 --> 00:37:38.010
<v Speaker 3>and it's very much akin to what you just</v>
<v Speaker 3>described,</v>

697
00:37:38.011 --> 00:37:40.160
<v Speaker 3>was that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

698
00:37:40.490 --> 00:37:41.323
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the borders of who who was validly </v>

699
00:37:45.361 --> 00:37:46.194
<v Speaker 3>accused of being a victimizer </v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially expanded to include every </v>

700
00:37:50.610 --> 00:37:51.430
<v Speaker 3>once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

701
00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:53.450
<v Speaker 3>and that's actually right in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's in a,</v>

702
00:37:53.451 --> 00:37:55.230
<v Speaker 3>in a perverse sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's right.</v>

703
00:37:55.470 --> 00:38:00.470
<v Speaker 3>Because if you position yourself </v>
<v Speaker 3>properly in the historical flow,</v>

704
00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:04.590
<v Speaker 3>then you should see yourself as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>perpetrator and a victim equally.</v>

705
00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:05.453
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not the right way to see yourself </v>

706
00:38:06.001 --> 00:38:07.500
<v Speaker 3>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you're going to play that game,</v>

707
00:38:07.501 --> 00:38:10.590
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be on both sides of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then that issue is,</v>

708
00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:13.230
<v Speaker 3>and this is related to your idea about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

709
00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:16.290
<v Speaker 3>in your platoon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got one person who sadistic.</v>

710
00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:17.311
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

711
00:38:17.311 --> 00:38:21.390
<v Speaker 3>well let's even assume that at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>beginning of the Russian revolution,</v>

712
00:38:21.391 --> 00:38:22.224
<v Speaker 3>that the vast majority of the people who</v>
<v Speaker 3>were motivated by communism were </v>

713
00:38:25.531 --> 00:38:29.910
<v Speaker 3>actually compassionate with regards to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the dispossessed peasantry.</v>

714
00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:31.290
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe that,</v>

715
00:38:31.291 --> 00:38:35.190
<v Speaker 3>but we could say that that was even a </v>
<v Speaker 3>significant minority.</v>

716
00:38:35.650 --> 00:38:36.640
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the question is,</v>

717
00:38:36.641 --> 00:38:38.590
<v Speaker 3>do you just say on it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was your,</v>

718
00:38:38.650 --> 00:38:39.630
<v Speaker 3>what was your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

719
00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:41.460
<v Speaker 3>hypothetical percentage?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

720
00:38:41.461 --> 00:38:42.041
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

721
00:38:42.041 --> 00:38:42.874
<v Speaker 3>let's say it's 20% or let's even say </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's 50% of people who are genuinely </v>

722
00:38:46.781 --> 00:38:49.060
<v Speaker 3>motivated by compassion for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>dispossessed,</v>

723
00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:50.253
<v Speaker 3>but then there's another minority.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we could even say it was only 10% </v>

724
00:38:54.491 --> 00:38:56.890
<v Speaker 3>to begin with who weren't motivated by </v>
<v Speaker 3>that at all.</v>

725
00:38:56.891 --> 00:38:59.980
<v Speaker 3>They were motivated by the jealousy and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the spite and the,</v>

726
00:39:00.010 --> 00:39:00.843
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the resentment that Solzhenitsyn </v>

727
00:39:02.291 --> 00:39:03.124
<v Speaker 3>describes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they were the ones who are after </v>

728
00:39:04.781 --> 00:39:06.370
<v Speaker 3>those to be persecuted.</v>

729
00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:09.880
<v Speaker 3>And the thing is they got the upper hand</v>
<v Speaker 3>really rapidly.</v>

730
00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:12.460
<v Speaker 3>And it might be because the carnivorous </v>
<v Speaker 3>types,</v>

731
00:39:12.461 --> 00:39:13.294
<v Speaker 3>the predatory types are much more </v>
<v Speaker 3>dangerous and powerful than the </v>

732
00:39:16.571 --> 00:39:19.060
<v Speaker 3>compassionate types.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they'll take them out instantly.</v>

733
00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:19.690
<v Speaker 3>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

734
00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:22.270
<v Speaker 3>we're willing to step up and smash </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone.</v>

735
00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:23.890
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of the people that are saying,</v>

736
00:39:23.891 --> 00:39:24.850
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we just want to help.</v>

737
00:39:24.910 --> 00:39:25.810
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

738
00:39:25.811 --> 00:39:26.140
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

739
00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:26.973
<v Speaker 3>and there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's someone I actually cited a guy </v>

740
00:39:28.571 --> 00:39:29.404
<v Speaker 3>named,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think his name was walter lots us in </v>

741
00:39:30.671 --> 00:39:32.230
<v Speaker 3>the forward who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who wrote,</v>

742
00:39:32.231 --> 00:39:33.064
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrote in a journal called red terror </v>

743
00:39:34.391 --> 00:39:37.240
<v Speaker 3>that if you were interrogating an enemy </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the state,</v>

744
00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:41.320
<v Speaker 3>you didn't bother with niceties like </v>
<v Speaker 3>their individual guilt.</v>

745
00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:43.480
<v Speaker 3>That was a barrage waze,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

746
00:39:43.690 --> 00:39:44.890
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>conceit.</v>

747
00:39:45.070 --> 00:39:46.840
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's really important thing to keep in</v>

748
00:39:46.841 --> 00:39:47.674
<v Speaker 3>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you want it to do is to do a class </v>

749
00:39:49.421 --> 00:39:51.340
<v Speaker 3>based analysis and find out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

750
00:39:51.341 --> 00:39:55.720
<v Speaker 3>are they a member of let's say the Kulak</v>
<v Speaker 3>or the affiliates of the [inaudible],</v>

751
00:39:55.730 --> 00:40:00.040
<v Speaker 3>which is a lovely way of expanding your </v>
<v Speaker 3>list of potential victims and then you,</v>

752
00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:02.170
<v Speaker 3>you execute accordingly.</v>

753
00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:03.640
<v Speaker 3>And that would mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

754
00:40:03.641 --> 00:40:06.070
<v Speaker 3>the person that you're interrogating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

755
00:40:06.071 --> 00:40:06.904
<v Speaker 3>Or The class member that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>interrogating and then their children </v>

756
00:40:08.941 --> 00:40:09.774
<v Speaker 3>and perhaps also their grandchildren and</v>
<v Speaker 3>lots of himself was eventually executed </v>

757
00:40:12.911 --> 00:40:13.744
<v Speaker 3>by the Stellan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As somebody wrote to me after I wrote </v>

758
00:40:15.461 --> 00:40:17.830
<v Speaker 3>the foreword and told me that that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>his eventual fate.</v>

759
00:40:17.831 --> 00:40:18.670
<v Speaker 3>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

760
00:40:18.671 --> 00:40:19.504
<v Speaker 3>talk about standing on a chair and </v>
<v Speaker 3>putting the new surround your own neck </v>

761
00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:24.880
<v Speaker 3>and kicking it out from underneath you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

762
00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:26.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he basically,</v>

763
00:40:26.410 --> 00:40:29.770
<v Speaker 3>he murdered himself fundamentally and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

764
00:40:29.771 --> 00:40:32.680
<v Speaker 3>you could say in some sense that was the</v>
<v Speaker 3>story of the Soviet Union to a,</v>

765
00:40:32.681 --> 00:40:33.514
<v Speaker 3>to a tremendous degree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's one part going back to the ever </v>

766
00:40:37.361 --> 00:40:38.750
<v Speaker 3>expanding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

767
00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:42.280
<v Speaker 3>people that need to be destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a point in,</v>

768
00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:43.900
<v Speaker 3>in the book where he starts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's saying,</v>

769
00:40:43.901 --> 00:40:44.231
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

770
00:40:44.231 --> 00:40:45.064
<v Speaker 3>there's insects Stalin's describe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or maybe it was lennon was describing </v>

771
00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:52.780
<v Speaker 3>these certain people as insects that </v>
<v Speaker 3>needed to be destroyed.</v>

772
00:40:53.290 --> 00:40:55.630
<v Speaker 3>And then he just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that just starts off with,</v>

773
00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:57.680
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that are rabble rousers yeah,</v>

774
00:40:57.710 --> 00:40:59.050
<v Speaker 3>they're insects.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

775
00:40:59.190 --> 00:41:00.023
<v Speaker 3>and then it just expands and expands and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it's got priests and then it's got </v>

776
00:41:03.070 --> 00:41:07.470
<v Speaker 3>engineers and physicians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone in suckers.</v>

777
00:41:07.890 --> 00:41:09.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rec Records.</v>

778
00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:10.720
<v Speaker 3>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the word that they use or that he</v>

779
00:41:10.721 --> 00:41:13.530
<v Speaker 3>uses in the book for a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for basically saboteurs.</v>

780
00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:17.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that expands beyond comprehension.</v>

781
00:41:17.231 --> 00:41:18.064
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because at every single problem that </v>

782
00:41:19.871 --> 00:41:20.704
<v Speaker 3>there is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the fault of some person out there </v>

783
00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:24.290
<v Speaker 3>that sabotage and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they,</v>

784
00:41:24.310 --> 00:41:27.940
<v Speaker 3>they do this show trial and he talks </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it in the book for,</v>

785
00:41:28.290 --> 00:41:29.123
<v Speaker 3>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the phrase that he uses or that </v>

786
00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:36.000
<v Speaker 3>they use at the rush that the Soviets </v>
<v Speaker 3>used was organizers of the famine.</v>

787
00:41:37.070 --> 00:41:38.930
<v Speaker 3>Meaning like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

788
00:41:38.931 --> 00:41:41.390
<v Speaker 3>you're starving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And these people over here,</v>

789
00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:42.283
<v Speaker 3>they're the reason you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are the people that organize the </v>

790
00:41:44.001 --> 00:41:44.450
<v Speaker 3>famine.</v>

791
00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:45.283
<v Speaker 3>They're the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're the records of production of </v>

792
00:41:46.401 --> 00:41:47.234
<v Speaker 3>food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you bet,</v>

793
00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:48.021
<v Speaker 3>you bet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

794
00:41:48.021 --> 00:41:49.100
<v Speaker 3>it was either that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

795
00:41:49.101 --> 00:41:50.930
<v Speaker 3>you imagine that you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

796
00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:56.050
<v Speaker 3>you adopt a worldview and that worldview</v>
<v Speaker 3>enables you to,</v>

797
00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:57.433
<v Speaker 3>at least in principle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>organize yourself with other people and </v>

798
00:41:59.391 --> 00:42:02.660
<v Speaker 3>to provide you with a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychological stability.</v>

799
00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:03.913
<v Speaker 3>And then things go dreadfully wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you have a choice which is to </v>

800
00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:10.580
<v Speaker 3>reevaluate your worldview,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is of course what social needs and</v>

801
00:42:10.581 --> 00:42:11.414
<v Speaker 3>does in the gulag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Archipelago in a very deep ways </v>

802
00:42:13.041 --> 00:42:15.480
<v Speaker 3>reorganized his entire worldview.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

803
00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:19.010
<v Speaker 3>or you can look for reasons why you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>right and,</v>

804
00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:19.963
<v Speaker 3>and these things are happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Solzhenitsyn talks a lot in the </v>

805
00:42:22.011 --> 00:42:22.844
<v Speaker 3>Gulag archipelago about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see he had a moral condone drum when he </v>

806
00:42:26.181 --> 00:42:29.090
<v Speaker 3>was in prison and he started his moral </v>
<v Speaker 3>awakening,</v>

807
00:42:29.091 --> 00:42:29.924
<v Speaker 3>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was trying to figure out how to </v>

808
00:42:31.251 --> 00:42:33.140
<v Speaker 3>treat other people who were imprisoned.</v>

809
00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:38.180
<v Speaker 3>He had a real moral conundrum when a </v>
<v Speaker 3>committed communist was dragged into the</v>

810
00:42:38.181 --> 00:42:40.130
<v Speaker 3>Gulag system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which happened all the time.</v>

811
00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:41.143
<v Speaker 3>And he said those people were in </v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly dire straits because not </v>

812
00:42:44.781 --> 00:42:45.614
<v Speaker 3>only had they been subject to the entire</v>
<v Speaker 3>tyrannical weight of the deceitful </v>

813
00:42:48.951 --> 00:42:49.784
<v Speaker 3>state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was at the hands of their own </v>

814
00:42:51.261 --> 00:42:53.690
<v Speaker 3>comrades and friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the,</v>

815
00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:54.520
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

816
00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:55.353
<v Speaker 3>the committed communists would enter the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gulag and they would still be in there </v>

817
00:42:59.151 --> 00:43:01.370
<v Speaker 3>morally superior phase,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

818
00:43:01.371 --> 00:43:02.204
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that their incarceration was a mistake </v>

819
00:43:04.341 --> 00:43:05.174
<v Speaker 3>and that things would be set right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that there was nothing wrong with </v>

820
00:43:06.921 --> 00:43:09.140
<v Speaker 3>the system and they would attempt to </v>
<v Speaker 3>justify it.</v>

821
00:43:09.141 --> 00:43:09.974
<v Speaker 3>And Solzhenitsyn was no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>never sure how to react to these people </v>

822
00:43:13.311 --> 00:43:15.710
<v Speaker 3>ethically because on the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>while they were,</v>

823
00:43:15.930 --> 00:43:16.763
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>devastated because now they were </v>

824
00:43:17.751 --> 00:43:18.584
<v Speaker 3>political prisoners and maybe they got a</v>
<v Speaker 3>20 year sentence and they were in </v>

825
00:43:21.051 --> 00:43:22.100
<v Speaker 3>terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

826
00:43:22.101 --> 00:43:24.260
<v Speaker 3>stripped of their family and just </v>
<v Speaker 3>ruined.</v>

827
00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:25.363
<v Speaker 3>But on other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were still avid supporters of the </v>

828
00:43:27.561 --> 00:43:28.394
<v Speaker 3>very fist that had crushed them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so his eventual conclusion was that </v>

829
00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:36.890
<v Speaker 3>until they broke and repented,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

830
00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:37.813
<v Speaker 3>they weren't to be allied with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were still essentially on the side </v>

831
00:43:40.791 --> 00:43:44.410
<v Speaker 3>of the wall of the perpetrator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it seems to me that,</v>

832
00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:45.680
<v Speaker 3>that that's right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

833
00:43:45.681 --> 00:43:47.800
<v Speaker 3>that's unrepentant sin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say.</v>

834
00:43:47.801 --> 00:43:49.340
<v Speaker 3>And it isn't till you,</v>

835
00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:52.793
<v Speaker 3>what would you say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Until you take responsibility for your </v>

836
00:43:55.061 --> 00:43:55.894
<v Speaker 3>own complicitness in your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in your unfair interrogation that you </v>

837
00:43:59.261 --> 00:44:01.840
<v Speaker 3>get to join the ranks of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

838
00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:06.610
<v Speaker 3>of valuable in suffering humanity again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

839
00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:08.570
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

840
00:44:08.570 --> 00:44:10.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the,</v>

841
00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:11.223
<v Speaker 3>the extension of the persecution is </v>
<v Speaker 3>really something that's horrifying to </v>

842
00:44:15.441 --> 00:44:16.274
<v Speaker 3>see how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who constituted a victimizer the ranks </v>

843
00:44:20.331 --> 00:44:23.510
<v Speaker 3>of who constituted victimizer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just grew and grew and grew and grew.</v>

844
00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:24.433
<v Speaker 3>One of the most shocking groups of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that ended up in the gulags were </v>

845
00:44:28.310 --> 00:44:32.100
<v Speaker 3>the dam Soviet soldiers that had just </v>
<v Speaker 3>got</v>

846
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:36.330
<v Speaker 1>back home fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just including you can't make up.</v>

847
00:44:36.350 --> 00:44:38.050
<v Speaker 1>They can't make that up on committing </v>
<v Speaker 1>assaults and mission,</v>

848
00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:43.080
<v Speaker 1>who was like in close combat with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>enemy.</v>

849
00:44:43.830 --> 00:44:46.800
<v Speaker 1>And he wrote a letter to one of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>buddies and said,</v>

850
00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:47.843
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this doesn't seem like to be a great </v>

851
00:44:48.421 --> 00:44:50.180
<v Speaker 1>decision by Stalin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

852
00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:52.410
<v Speaker 1>And next thing you know he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's in.</v>

853
00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:53.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

854
00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:53.990
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well this stolen,</v>

855
00:44:53.991 --> 00:44:55.370
<v Speaker 3>stolen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>decided that,</v>

856
00:44:55.490 --> 00:44:56.750
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is something that you,</v>

857
00:44:56.751 --> 00:44:57.584
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't,</v>

858
00:44:57.590 --> 00:44:59.990
<v Speaker 3>you can't believe this while it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is this,</v>

859
00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:01.280
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

860
00:45:01.370 --> 00:45:02.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there's something,</v>

861
00:45:02.361 --> 00:45:04.640
<v Speaker 3>say titanic at the bottom of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

862
00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:05.533
<v Speaker 3>mythologically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's also something that's like a </v>

863
00:45:07.671 --> 00:45:10.700
<v Speaker 3>cosmic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like cosmic black humor.</v>

864
00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:14.660
<v Speaker 3>It's like the sign on Auschwitz that </v>
<v Speaker 3>said work will set you free.</v>

865
00:45:14.780 --> 00:45:16.250
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a joke,</v>

866
00:45:16.370 --> 00:45:17.203
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a whole,</v>

867
00:45:17.330 --> 00:45:19.010
<v Speaker 3>it's a terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible,</v>

868
00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:22.870
<v Speaker 3>dark joke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so much of this has the element of,</v>

869
00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:27.380
<v Speaker 3>of exactly that kind of surreal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate to say humor,</v>

870
00:45:27.381 --> 00:45:28.520
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's right.</v>

871
00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:32.210
<v Speaker 3>I mean stolen decided that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

872
00:45:32.211 --> 00:45:36.770
<v Speaker 3>so the Soviet prisoners of war were not </v>
<v Speaker 3>covered by the Geneva Convention for the</v>

873
00:45:36.771 --> 00:45:37.604
<v Speaker 3>treatment of prisoners of war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Castelan re refused to sign that </v>

874
00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:41.113
<v Speaker 3>agreement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like if you were an allied prisoner </v>

875
00:45:43.761 --> 00:45:44.594
<v Speaker 3>of the Germans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't like you were having a great </v>

876
00:45:46.011 --> 00:45:46.610
<v Speaker 3>time of it.</v>

877
00:45:46.610 --> 00:45:49.400
<v Speaker 3>Like food was in short supply and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>were treated pretty brutally.</v>

878
00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:53.900
<v Speaker 3>But the Soviets were kept separately and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were doing so badly that the allies</v>

879
00:45:53.901 --> 00:45:56.990
<v Speaker 3>used to throw food packets over the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fence when that was an option.</v>

880
00:45:57.350 --> 00:45:58.183
<v Speaker 3>So the Soviet prisoners of war were </v>
<v Speaker 3>treated absolutely dreadfully and </v>

881
00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:04.740
<v Speaker 3>Estelle and didn't care about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

882
00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:09.440
<v Speaker 3>and then when they were released and </v>
<v Speaker 3>went back to the Soviet Union,</v>

883
00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:10.513
<v Speaker 3>his dictum was that because they had </v>
<v Speaker 3>been exposed to the capitalist West or </v>

884
00:46:16.071 --> 00:46:16.904
<v Speaker 3>even the Nazi west for that matter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they had now been intolerably </v>

885
00:46:20.841 --> 00:46:25.010
<v Speaker 3>corrupted on ideological grounds and had</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be put in the prison camps.</v>

886
00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:28.340
<v Speaker 3>So that was the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was your destiny as you know.</v>

887
00:46:28.341 --> 00:46:29.121
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

888
00:46:29.121 --> 00:46:32.690
<v Speaker 3>you were frontline Russian soldier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was just brutal beyond belief.</v>

889
00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:33.673
<v Speaker 3>Their army was completely unprepared for</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hitler's invasion because Stellan </v>

890
00:46:36.810 --> 00:46:39.200
<v Speaker 3>trusted Hitler in his strange way.</v>

891
00:46:39.410 --> 00:46:40.243
<v Speaker 3>And so they were completely unprepared.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And of course then fighting the Soviet </v>

892
00:46:43.250 --> 00:46:44.300
<v Speaker 3>Union with its winters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

893
00:46:44.301 --> 00:46:45.134
<v Speaker 3>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just can't imagine what that must </v>

894
00:46:47.831 --> 00:46:48.664
<v Speaker 3>have been like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then to be thrown in a prisoner of </v>

895
00:46:50.271 --> 00:46:51.104
<v Speaker 3>war camp at the bottom of the rung and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then to be brought back to your country </v>

896
00:46:55.820 --> 00:47:00.800
<v Speaker 3>and then to be imprisoned as a trader </v>
<v Speaker 3>because as a class you'd been exposed to</v>

897
00:47:00.801 --> 00:47:03.140
<v Speaker 3>the wrong ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you just,</v>

898
00:47:03.740 --> 00:47:05.240
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

899
00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:09.950
<v Speaker 3>it's unimaginably vile and surreal at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the same time.</v>

900
00:47:10.370 --> 00:47:11.440
<v Speaker 3>And it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

901
00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:12.313
<v Speaker 3>you shake your head for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>while it's such a shock to read the </v>

902
00:47:15.501 --> 00:47:16.750
<v Speaker 3>Gulag archipelago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

903
00:47:16.850 --> 00:47:20.800
<v Speaker 3>you just can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

904
00:47:20.810 --> 00:47:21.920
<v Speaker 3>it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it isn't,</v>

905
00:47:21.921 --> 00:47:24.440
<v Speaker 3>it's like Dante's inferno.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a trip into hell</v>

906
00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:25.620
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

907
00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:28.080
<v Speaker 1>And I guess your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I was trying to say when we,</v>

908
00:47:28.081 --> 00:47:28.914
<v Speaker 1>when we started this conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to say that it's like </v>

909
00:47:30.731 --> 00:47:32.070
<v Speaker 1>you're watching this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

910
00:47:32.170 --> 00:47:32.831
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>

911
00:47:32.831 --> 00:47:35.440
<v Speaker 1>it's like a bad comedy movie and you'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

912
00:47:35.441 --> 00:47:37.540
<v Speaker 1>well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'd be really that you'd think,</v>

913
00:47:37.570 --> 00:47:37.931
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

914
00:47:37.931 --> 00:47:38.980
<v Speaker 1>when you take a comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

915
00:47:38.990 --> 00:47:39.823
<v Speaker 1>one of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the ways you can make people </v>

916
00:47:40.751 --> 00:47:41.584
<v Speaker 1>laugh is take something ordinary and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe make it much more extreme in the </v>

917
00:47:44.831 --> 00:47:47.200
<v Speaker 1>more extreme you make it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more funny it becomes.</v>

918
00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:50.770
<v Speaker 1>That's what like happened here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're looking at this thing going,</v>

919
00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:52.460
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah.</v>

920
00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:56.950
<v Speaker 1>They seem to be trying to make this </v>
<v Speaker 1>funny because who in could ever conceive</v>

921
00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:01.990
<v Speaker 1>that you could take your frontline </v>
<v Speaker 1>soldiers who were captured and in misery</v>

922
00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:05.290
<v Speaker 1>and when they return home instead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>treating them like heroes,</v>

923
00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:08.920
<v Speaker 1>instead you put them back into a prison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Worst one,</v>

924
00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:10.780
<v Speaker 1>you can't even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't even,</v>

925
00:48:10.810 --> 00:48:11.950
<v Speaker 1>that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

926
00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:14.080
<v Speaker 1>You can't make this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't make it up.</v>

927
00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:15.453
<v Speaker 1>Did you see?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that movie was the death of </v>

928
00:48:17.291 --> 00:48:19.030
<v Speaker 1>Stalin did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did not see it.</v>

929
00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:19.740
<v Speaker 1>But that's</v>

930
00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:22.980
<v Speaker 3>worth seeing because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very interesting because one of the</v>

931
00:48:22.981 --> 00:48:23.814
<v Speaker 3>things about that movie is that it </v>
<v Speaker 3>captures that surreal element because </v>

932
00:48:27.121 --> 00:48:28.890
<v Speaker 3>it's a black comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

933
00:48:28.891 --> 00:48:29.724
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there are comical things happening </v>

934
00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:33.833
<v Speaker 3>in the movie in that terrible dark way </v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly at the same time that in the </v>

935
00:48:37.981 --> 00:48:40.620
<v Speaker 3>background,</v>
<v Speaker 3>genuinely terrible things are happening.</v>

936
00:48:40.621 --> 00:48:44.680
<v Speaker 3>So it's that horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's that it's,</v>

937
00:48:44.690 --> 00:48:45.523
<v Speaker 3>it's got that horrible satirical flavor </v>
<v Speaker 3>that runs through books like the Gulag </v>

938
00:48:49.471 --> 00:48:50.730
<v Speaker 3>archipelago where you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

939
00:48:50.731 --> 00:48:51.564
<v Speaker 3>there's just no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is so absurd that there's no </v>

940
00:48:53.791 --> 00:48:58.791
<v Speaker 3>possible way it could have occurred.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And yet that's not only did it happen,</v>

941
00:48:59.700 --> 00:49:02.580
<v Speaker 3>there was like a contest to top the </v>
<v Speaker 3>absurdity,</v>

942
00:49:02.850 --> 00:49:03.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to to,</v>

943
00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:06.270
<v Speaker 3>to consider the engineers for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>records is,</v>

944
00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:07.313
<v Speaker 3>well these people were building the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Soviet system to the degree that it was </v>

945
00:49:10.051 --> 00:49:10.884
<v Speaker 3>built and then to turn around and accuse</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly those people of being the ones </v>

946
00:49:14.371 --> 00:49:15.810
<v Speaker 3>who destroy and undermine it.</v>

947
00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:17.250
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's part of,</v>

948
00:49:17.850 --> 00:49:20.940
<v Speaker 3>I really think that what's what </v>
<v Speaker 3>underlies this,</v>

949
00:49:21.330 --> 00:49:22.163
<v Speaker 3>whatever this is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think this is what manifests </v>

950
00:49:24.751 --> 00:49:25.584
<v Speaker 3>itself in the worst of the leftist </v>
<v Speaker 3>collectivism is a real hatred for </v>

951
00:49:29.281 --> 00:49:31.770
<v Speaker 3>anything that smacks of competence at </v>
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>

952
00:49:31.890 --> 00:49:32.723
<v Speaker 3>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tried to imagine those Russian </v>

953
00:49:34.231 --> 00:49:36.480
<v Speaker 3>villages because I come from a small </v>
<v Speaker 3>town,</v>

954
00:49:36.481 --> 00:49:38.280
<v Speaker 3>a small northern town too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I kind of,</v>

955
00:49:38.340 --> 00:49:39.173
<v Speaker 3>I tried to imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so imagine that you're in an isolated </v>

956
00:49:41.851 --> 00:49:42.684
<v Speaker 3>village and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a peasant village and the peasants </v>

957
00:49:45.541 --> 00:49:47.130
<v Speaker 3>weren't fried that long ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

958
00:49:47.131 --> 00:49:47.964
<v Speaker 3>They were basically surfs until,</v>
<v Speaker 3>until about the middle of the second </v>

959
00:49:51.601 --> 00:49:55.350
<v Speaker 3>half of the 19th century.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they had been emancipated.</v>

960
00:49:55.351 --> 00:49:57.750
<v Speaker 3>And then some of those people who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>emancipated,</v>

961
00:49:57.751 --> 00:49:59.640
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little bit of land and started to have</v>

962
00:49:59.641 --> 00:50:00.520
<v Speaker 3>a life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

963
00:50:00.521 --> 00:50:01.354
<v Speaker 3>it started to be successful peasants and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were also the people that grew the </v>

964
00:50:04.171 --> 00:50:05.580
<v Speaker 3>bulk of the crops.</v>

965
00:50:05.730 --> 00:50:06.563
<v Speaker 3>Because what you see happening in any </v>
<v Speaker 3>productive domain is that a small </v>

966
00:50:09.571 --> 00:50:12.000
<v Speaker 3>percentage of people do almost all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>productive work.</v>

967
00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:12.893
<v Speaker 3>So there's a small percentage of </v>
<v Speaker 3>productive farmers who grow all the </v>

968
00:50:14.821 --> 00:50:15.990
<v Speaker 3>crops,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

969
00:50:15.991 --> 00:50:16.824
<v Speaker 3>And then there's all sorts of farmers </v>
<v Speaker 3>who were only farmers by name and they </v>

970
00:50:19.501 --> 00:50:21.300
<v Speaker 3>weren't successful at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you have,</v>

971
00:50:21.390 --> 00:50:25.530
<v Speaker 3>and then there was a certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship between being productive as</v>

972
00:50:25.531 --> 00:50:26.364
<v Speaker 3>a farmer and developing wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you had a house and maybe you </v>

973
00:50:29.091 --> 00:50:30.890
<v Speaker 3>could hire a person or two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

974
00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:33.320
<v Speaker 3>and which you'd think would be actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>be a good thing,</v>

975
00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:35.660
<v Speaker 3>especially if you are also growing food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

976
00:50:35.661 --> 00:50:36.494
<v Speaker 3>So you imagine you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get a village and now there's a bit </v>

977
00:50:38.841 --> 00:50:39.674
<v Speaker 3>of a socioeconomic pyramid and there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>some people that are doing well and </v>

978
00:50:42.741 --> 00:50:45.800
<v Speaker 3>there are really and there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it isn't the crooked people that are</v>

979
00:50:45.801 --> 00:50:49.520
<v Speaker 3>really annoying that people who like the</v>
<v Speaker 3>genuine Kulaks,</v>

980
00:50:49.521 --> 00:50:50.354
<v Speaker 3>let's say that that small percentage of </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychopathic types who were basically </v>

981
00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:56.720
<v Speaker 3>profiting criminally off the efforts of </v>
<v Speaker 3>others.</v>

982
00:50:56.930 --> 00:50:58.550
<v Speaker 3>Those aren't so annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those people,</v>

983
00:50:58.551 --> 00:51:00.800
<v Speaker 3>because they're rich,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they don't deserve it.</v>

984
00:51:01.130 --> 00:51:06.130
<v Speaker 3>And so they don't stand towards you as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>moral ideal that shames you.</v>

985
00:51:06.890 --> 00:51:10.220
<v Speaker 3>But the really annoying people are the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ones who are doing well and deserve it.</v>

986
00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:13.730
<v Speaker 3>Especially if you're someone who's doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing and is bitter.</v>

987
00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:14.631
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now,</v>

988
00:51:14.631 --> 00:51:15.464
<v Speaker 3>so there's the village and you've got </v>
<v Speaker 3>your people who are doing all right and </v>

989
00:51:17.631 --> 00:51:18.464
<v Speaker 3>then you've got a huge strout.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If people who aren't upset about the </v>

990
00:51:20.691 --> 00:51:23.630
<v Speaker 3>people who are doing well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they might even admire them and be happy</v>

991
00:51:23.631 --> 00:51:24.464
<v Speaker 3>that they're around because they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>making the community thrive and growing </v>

992
00:51:26.421 --> 00:51:28.160
<v Speaker 3>some food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you have this little,</v>

993
00:51:28.610 --> 00:51:30.090
<v Speaker 3>this little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

994
00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:31.093
<v Speaker 3>strata at the bottom of people who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>ne'er do wells and on the more </v>

995
00:51:34.251 --> 00:51:37.190
<v Speaker 3>psychopathic end of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they are bitter and resentful and,</v>

996
00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:39.590
<v Speaker 3>and waiting for their bloody </v>
<v Speaker 3>opportunity.</v>

997
00:51:39.770 --> 00:51:42.890
<v Speaker 3>And then the communist intellectuals </v>
<v Speaker 3>come into town and say,</v>

998
00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:44.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those people that are doing well,</v>

999
00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:48.680
<v Speaker 3>they actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything they've got is ill gotten and</v>

1000
00:51:48.700 --> 00:51:49.533
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1001
00:51:49.710 --> 00:51:52.100
<v Speaker 3>they stole it and they stole it from </v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1002
00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:53.300
<v Speaker 3>from you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1003
00:51:53.301 --> 00:51:55.660
<v Speaker 3>and look at how badly you're doing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason you're doing badly.</v>

1004
00:51:55.661 --> 00:51:58.790
<v Speaker 3>It's because these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these people who are lording it over you</v>

1005
00:51:58.791 --> 00:52:02.330
<v Speaker 3>and who have all this creature comfort,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they took that from you.</v>

1006
00:52:02.331 --> 00:52:03.470
<v Speaker 3>It's yours by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1007
00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:07.310
<v Speaker 3>And so then all that resentment and </v>
<v Speaker 3>jealousy and hatred and rage,</v>

1008
00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:09.920
<v Speaker 3>alcohol fueled as you might well </v>
<v Speaker 3>imagine,</v>

1009
00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:12.260
<v Speaker 3>has this moral,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1010
00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:13.153
<v Speaker 3>reason to go with pitchforks and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in a mob and surround those houses </v>

1011
00:52:16.881 --> 00:52:18.560
<v Speaker 3>and to strip them of everything they </v>
<v Speaker 3>have.</v>

1012
00:52:18.561 --> 00:52:19.394
<v Speaker 3>And to rape the women and to kill the </v>
<v Speaker 3>occupants or to ship them off to the </v>

1013
00:52:23.510 --> 00:52:24.343
<v Speaker 3>middle of Siberia when there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where they froze to death because there </v>

1014
00:52:25.401 --> 00:52:27.410
<v Speaker 3>were no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or died of dysentery or,</v>

1015
00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:29.840
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or whatever other plague managed to,</v>

1016
00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:33.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>weave its way through these camps.</v>

1017
00:52:33.350 --> 00:52:36.560
<v Speaker 3>And so you have the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have the intellectuals providing the</v>

1018
00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:41.710
<v Speaker 3>moral rationale for the worst ethical </v>
<v Speaker 3>actors in these small villages doing the</v>

1019
00:52:42.021 --> 00:52:44.900
<v Speaker 3>worst possible things under the guise of</v>
<v Speaker 3>compassion.</v>

1020
00:52:45.530 --> 00:52:46.363
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's part of that victim </v>

1021
00:52:47.211 --> 00:52:48.830
<v Speaker 3>victimizer narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

1022
00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:49.850
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you knew,</v>

1023
00:52:49.850 --> 00:52:52.310
<v Speaker 3>you could imagine that you can imagine a</v>
<v Speaker 3>dark night,</v>

1024
00:52:52.311 --> 00:52:54.890
<v Speaker 3>you can imagine the winter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can imagine the alcohol,</v>

1025
00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:55.873
<v Speaker 3>you can imagine the rage that fuels </v>
<v Speaker 3>these people who are drinking too much </v>

1026
00:52:59.061 --> 00:53:01.940
<v Speaker 3>in the pubs that have been sitting there</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the last 20 years.</v>

1027
00:53:02.030 --> 00:53:03.200
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would you say?</v>

1028
00:53:03.230 --> 00:53:05.960
<v Speaker 3>Eating up their own souls with </v>
<v Speaker 3>resentment and bitterness.</v>

1029
00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:09.290
<v Speaker 3>And then someone comes in and says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're the true victim here,</v>

1030
00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:11.330
<v Speaker 3>and here's the people that you can go </v>
<v Speaker 3>after.</v>

1031
00:53:11.450 --> 00:53:13.790
<v Speaker 3>And then like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you play that on your imagination,</v>

1032
00:53:13.791 --> 00:53:17.810
<v Speaker 3>you get some real sense of exactly what </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of horror that would produce.</v>

1033
00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:20.240
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think about the rape for example,</v>

1034
00:53:20.241 --> 00:53:21.980
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or just the theft or,</v>

1035
00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:23.113
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's the rape that you can really </v>

1036
00:53:24.411 --> 00:53:25.244
<v Speaker 3>think about as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as absolute revenge for all that bitter </v>

1037
00:53:29.281 --> 00:53:31.740
<v Speaker 3>resentment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All fueled by the fact that,</v>

1038
00:53:31.890 --> 00:53:32.723
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd sat there for the last 20 years </v>

1039
00:53:33.961 --> 00:53:37.080
<v Speaker 3>being completely goddamn useless and </v>
<v Speaker 3>better and,</v>

1040
00:53:37.081 --> 00:53:38.130
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1041
00:53:38.190 --> 00:53:39.960
<v Speaker 3>and angry and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1042
00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:43.920
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and fantasizing about the day that would</v>

1043
00:53:43.921 --> 00:53:47.760
<v Speaker 3>come where you'd have your opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God and then the whole country,</v>

1044
00:53:47.860 --> 00:53:49.880
<v Speaker 3>then that was the whole country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1045
00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:51.270
<v Speaker 3>it's just unbelievable.</v>

1046
00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:52.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

1047
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:52.833
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1048
00:53:53.140 --> 00:53:55.520
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he spells that out very clearly.</v>

1049
00:53:55.550 --> 00:53:58.130
<v Speaker 1>And he says it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what he's saying?</v>

1050
00:53:58.310 --> 00:53:59.143
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying that you've got a psychopath </v>

1051
00:53:59.931 --> 00:54:03.440
<v Speaker 1>and your platoon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he saying that psychopath,</v>

1052
00:54:03.441 --> 00:54:04.274
<v Speaker 1>all that psychopath needs to flip is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the someone to tell them that that's </v>

1053
00:54:08.061 --> 00:54:10.340
<v Speaker 1>the right thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly what happened.</v>

1054
00:54:10.341 --> 00:54:11.330
<v Speaker 1>What'd you just say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

1055
00:54:11.490 --> 00:54:12.323
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those guys that were slightly </v>

1056
00:54:13.221 --> 00:54:14.190
<v Speaker 1>psychopathic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1057
00:54:14.570 --> 00:54:15.800
<v Speaker 1>And then it becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1058
00:54:15.801 --> 00:54:18.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the head psychopath and you're in my</v>

1059
00:54:18.591 --> 00:54:19.424
<v Speaker 1>village and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say you're one of those people </v>

1060
00:54:21.501 --> 00:54:22.820
<v Speaker 1>that are in the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1061
00:54:22.821 --> 00:54:24.770
<v Speaker 1>whose side are you going to be on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a psychopath.</v>

1062
00:54:24.771 --> 00:54:25.910
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're not on my side,</v>

1063
00:54:25.911 --> 00:54:28.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to kill you next.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you go,</v>

1064
00:54:28.581 --> 00:54:28.941
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1065
00:54:28.941 --> 00:54:32.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm on your side too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's definitely,</v>

1066
00:54:32.250 --> 00:54:33.270
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1067
00:54:33.271 --> 00:54:38.271
<v Speaker 3>it's not like it takes much pressure on </v>
<v Speaker 3>people to have them fold.</v>

1068
00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:40.650
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things you see,</v>

1069
00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:41.633
<v Speaker 3>you see happening right now in our </v>
<v Speaker 3>cultures that's happening to people all </v>

1070
00:54:44.251 --> 00:54:46.230
<v Speaker 3>the time with these twitter wars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1071
00:54:46.231 --> 00:54:47.064
<v Speaker 3>someone will say something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll express an opinion and then </v>

1072
00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:53.460
<v Speaker 3>they'll get mobbed by and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but only abstractly.</v>

1073
00:54:53.461 --> 00:54:55.410
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like there's pitchfork wielding</v>

1074
00:54:55.411 --> 00:54:58.290
<v Speaker 3>mobs at their house and I'm not making </v>
<v Speaker 3>light of it.</v>

1075
00:54:58.291 --> 00:54:58.651
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1076
00:54:58.651 --> 00:55:01.290
<v Speaker 3>it's no pleasant thing to be mobbed on </v>
<v Speaker 3>twitter.</v>

1077
00:55:01.770 --> 00:55:02.603
<v Speaker 3>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's an obstruction compared to these </v>

1078
00:55:05.041 --> 00:55:07.380
<v Speaker 3>people showing up at your house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1079
00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:08.513
<v Speaker 3>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what'll happen is that people will </v>

1080
00:55:10.590 --> 00:55:12.990
<v Speaker 3>go through an abject apology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1081
00:55:12.991 --> 00:55:13.531
<v Speaker 3>and they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1082
00:55:13.531 --> 00:55:14.610
<v Speaker 3>I really didn't mean it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1083
00:55:14.611 --> 00:55:15.444
<v Speaker 3>and now I understand what my privileges </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I see how what I said could have </v>

1084
00:55:18.511 --> 00:55:20.520
<v Speaker 3>been very hurtful to people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1085
00:55:20.521 --> 00:55:21.354
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they wander through that entire apology </v>

1086
00:55:22.651 --> 00:55:24.490
<v Speaker 3>and fold almost instantly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1087
00:55:24.660 --> 00:55:28.980
<v Speaker 3>and that's under almost,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost no pressure compared to what real</v>

1088
00:55:28.981 --> 00:55:29.814
<v Speaker 3>pressure is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A real pressure is when the wolves are </v>

1089
00:55:32.371 --> 00:55:35.970
<v Speaker 3>actually at your door rather than just </v>
<v Speaker 3>barking off in the distance.</v>

1090
00:55:35.971 --> 00:55:38.640
<v Speaker 3>But people will fold just when they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>barking in the distance.</v>

1091
00:55:39.060 --> 00:55:39.893
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1092
00:55:39.900 --> 00:55:40.733
<v Speaker 1>there's one lawyer that he talks about </v>
<v Speaker 1>in here is the same thing as the story </v>

1093
00:55:44.131 --> 00:55:45.240
<v Speaker 1>that you describe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I forget the guy's name,</v>

1094
00:55:45.241 --> 00:55:46.074
<v Speaker 1>but this guy was like the premier </v>
<v Speaker 1>prosecuting lawyer for the Soviet </v>

1095
00:55:50.370 --> 00:55:51.203
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he just rips people apart over and </v>

1096
00:55:54.090 --> 00:55:54.923
<v Speaker 1>over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as you read about what happened to </v>

1097
00:55:56.411 --> 00:55:57.390
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure enough,</v>

1098
00:55:57.660 --> 00:55:59.670
<v Speaker 1>he's one of the guys had been ended up </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the,</v>

1099
00:55:59.850 --> 00:56:02.790
<v Speaker 1>on the defensive and Yam being executed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1100
00:56:02.820 --> 00:56:05.070
<v Speaker 1>Like they have all these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people they built,</v>

1101
00:56:05.460 --> 00:56:06.600
<v Speaker 1>they built,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1102
00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:07.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1103
00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:08.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1104
00:56:08.940 --> 00:56:12.330
<v Speaker 3>place of butchery and then threw </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves into it.</v>

1105
00:56:12.570 --> 00:56:13.470
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1106
00:56:13.580 --> 00:56:13.930
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1107
00:56:13.930 --> 00:56:17.610
<v Speaker 3>and you see Solzhenitsyn documents this </v>
<v Speaker 3>very carefully.</v>

1108
00:56:17.611 --> 00:56:20.250
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stalin killed all the people who,</v>

1109
00:56:20.460 --> 00:56:24.430
<v Speaker 3>who were foremost actors in the Russian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1110
00:56:24.431 --> 00:56:24.911
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1111
00:56:24.911 --> 00:56:27.880
<v Speaker 3>everyone was fed into the great grinding</v>
<v Speaker 3>machine.</v>

1112
00:56:28.450 --> 00:56:29.031
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1113
00:56:29.031 --> 00:56:30.670
<v Speaker 3>and Stalin himself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1114
00:56:31.990 --> 00:56:34.680
<v Speaker 3>it looked to me like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see,</v>

1115
00:56:34.790 --> 00:56:38.080
<v Speaker 3>he got himself into something </v>
<v Speaker 3>approximating a positive feedback loop,</v>

1116
00:56:38.081 --> 00:56:40.420
<v Speaker 3>which is a very dangerous thing to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>

1117
00:56:40.421 --> 00:56:43.780
<v Speaker 3>And I think Solzhenitsyn does a lovely </v>
<v Speaker 3>job of detailing this as well.</v>

1118
00:56:43.781 --> 00:56:44.614
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>imagine that I have a fair amount of </v>

1119
00:56:46.541 --> 00:56:50.440
<v Speaker 3>contempt for people to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I find that people are,</v>

1120
00:56:50.690 --> 00:56:51.523
<v Speaker 3>I'm not trusting person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I find that I'm very paranoid about </v>

1121
00:56:54.521 --> 00:56:55.354
<v Speaker 3>the fact that people are lying to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I develop a certain amount of </v>

1122
00:56:57.281 --> 00:56:58.540
<v Speaker 3>power and a reputation.</v>

1123
00:56:59.230 --> 00:57:03.550
<v Speaker 3>Well then people really do start lying </v>
<v Speaker 3>to me all the time in every gesture,</v>

1124
00:57:03.551 --> 00:57:05.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because every time they come near me,</v>

1125
00:57:05.351 --> 00:57:08.740
<v Speaker 3>they're absolutely terrified and they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to tell me anything that I want to</v>

1126
00:57:08.741 --> 00:57:09.574
<v Speaker 3>hear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And of course then all that does is </v>

1127
00:57:10.931 --> 00:57:15.370
<v Speaker 3>validate my view of how pathetic and </v>
<v Speaker 3>contemptible everyone is and so on.</v>

1128
00:57:15.371 --> 00:57:16.204
<v Speaker 3>The more that view gets validated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more I think that it's okay to </v>

1129
00:57:18.221 --> 00:57:21.370
<v Speaker 3>destroy people because look at how </v>
<v Speaker 3>pathetic and contemptible they are,</v>

1130
00:57:21.460 --> 00:57:24.520
<v Speaker 3>how they always lie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And all that means is that they lie even</v>

1131
00:57:24.521 --> 00:57:26.920
<v Speaker 3>more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so this whole thing just spirals out</v>

1132
00:57:26.921 --> 00:57:28.150
<v Speaker 3>of control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1133
00:57:28.180 --> 00:57:29.013
<v Speaker 3>stellan basically started out as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as the brutal enforcement henchmen for </v>

1134
00:57:34.300 --> 00:57:35.620
<v Speaker 3>henchmen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for Lennon,</v>

1135
00:57:35.950 --> 00:57:36.411
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

1136
00:57:36.411 --> 00:57:37.870
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the killer for hire.</v>

1137
00:57:38.020 --> 00:57:40.720
<v Speaker 3>And not like Lennon was above that sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of thing himself,</v>

1138
00:57:40.870 --> 00:57:42.220
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he trained,</v>

1139
00:57:42.221 --> 00:57:43.054
<v Speaker 3>stolen and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then Stalin's proclivity to be </v>

1140
00:57:46.961 --> 00:57:49.510
<v Speaker 3>murderous just kept expanding without </v>
<v Speaker 3>limit.</v>

1141
00:57:49.930 --> 00:57:50.591
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

1142
00:57:50.591 --> 00:57:53.230
<v Speaker 3>it was individuals and then it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>groups and then it was nations.</v>

1143
00:57:53.231 --> 00:57:53.981
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1144
00:57:53.981 --> 00:57:55.550
<v Speaker 3>by the end of his life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1145
00:57:55.560 --> 00:57:56.860
<v Speaker 3>what was it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the plot,</v>

1146
00:57:56.920 --> 00:57:59.560
<v Speaker 3>the plot to destroy the entire world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tu Tu,</v>

1147
00:57:59.590 --> 00:58:03.460
<v Speaker 3>Tu Tu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tu Tu Tu initiate the Third World War to</v>

1148
00:58:03.461 --> 00:58:08.080
<v Speaker 3>wipe out Europe to maybe destroy </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything and like there's no limit.</v>

1149
00:58:08.081 --> 00:58:10.210
<v Speaker 3>There was no limit to that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1150
00:58:10.250 --> 00:58:13.300
<v Speaker 3>and there's some evidence that that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>perhaps why he was killed,</v>

1151
00:58:13.510 --> 00:58:16.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because Stalin himself even went too far</v>

1152
00:58:16.211 --> 00:58:18.630
<v Speaker 3>for the horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>horrible,</v>

1153
00:58:18.900 --> 00:58:20.560
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what semi</v>

1154
00:58:23.570 --> 00:58:28.540
<v Speaker 3>the corrupted compadres that he had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'd arranged around himself.</v>

1155
00:58:28.541 --> 00:58:32.680
<v Speaker 3>He went too far even for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And thank God for that,</v>

1156
00:58:32.740 --> 00:58:34.240
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

1157
00:58:34.241 --> 00:58:35.074
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1158
00:58:35.260 --> 00:58:36.670
<v Speaker 3>it's absolute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1159
00:58:37.750 --> 00:58:38.583
<v Speaker 3>the thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the Gulag Archipelago Gulag </v>

1160
00:58:41.501 --> 00:58:42.334
<v Speaker 3>archipelago did for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this was also in keeping as a </v>

1161
00:58:44.921 --> 00:58:45.754
<v Speaker 3>consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>also have reading young at the same </v>

1162
00:58:47.351 --> 00:58:47.890
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1163
00:58:47.890 --> 00:58:49.590
<v Speaker 3>but it was certainly the Goo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like in,</v>

1164
00:58:49.591 --> 00:58:50.680
<v Speaker 3>in large part that did it.</v>

1165
00:58:50.890 --> 00:58:53.680
<v Speaker 3>I would say that in some sense it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>scared me straight.</v>

1166
00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:55.670
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see the,</v>

1167
00:58:55.800 --> 00:58:59.680
<v Speaker 3>the consequences of unethical behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 3>deceit,</v>

1168
00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:03.130
<v Speaker 3>the willingness to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to turn a blind eye.</v>

1169
00:59:03.550 --> 00:59:06.340
<v Speaker 3>So even sins of omission rather than </v>
<v Speaker 3>sins of commission.</v>

1170
00:59:06.341 --> 00:59:07.174
<v Speaker 3>Just to turn a blind eye.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The consequences of that are so </v>

1171
00:59:09.911 --> 00:59:13.960
<v Speaker 3>absolutely dreadful that it's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>acceptable.</v>

1172
00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:16.720
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's the right lesson from</v>
<v Speaker 3>the 20th century.</v>

1173
00:59:16.721 --> 00:59:18.120
<v Speaker 3>It's that you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1174
00:59:18.130 --> 00:59:19.120
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1175
00:59:19.420 --> 00:59:24.420
<v Speaker 3>you have a much more moral role to play </v>
<v Speaker 3>in keeping things straight.</v>

1176
00:59:24.830 --> 00:59:26.960
<v Speaker 3>Then you want to believe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1177
00:59:26.961 --> 00:59:27.920
<v Speaker 3>people think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1178
00:59:28.100 --> 00:59:30.110
<v Speaker 3>my life is basically meaningless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1179
00:59:30.111 --> 00:59:31.580
<v Speaker 3>well that's quite terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1180
00:59:31.581 --> 00:59:32.990
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of terrifying,</v>

1181
00:59:32.991 --> 00:59:35.780
<v Speaker 3>but it means you don't have any </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibility.</v>

1182
00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:38.060
<v Speaker 3>So there's a big advantage to thinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1183
00:59:38.380 --> 00:59:40.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not if nothing you do matters,</v>

1184
00:59:40.101 --> 00:59:40.934
<v Speaker 3>then nothing you do matters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you can do whatever you want and </v>

1185
00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:45.710
<v Speaker 3>that's horrifying and annihilistic sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of way.</v>

1186
00:59:45.710 --> 00:59:48.560
<v Speaker 3>But there's another kind of horror </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's more associated,</v>

1187
00:59:48.561 --> 00:59:49.394
<v Speaker 3>I think with the horror of hell fire </v>
<v Speaker 3>that was characteristic of the Medieval </v>

1188
00:59:52.730 --> 00:59:53.840
<v Speaker 3>Christian view is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is something like,</v>

1189
00:59:54.250 --> 00:59:56.990
<v Speaker 3>and if you strip it of its metaphysics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's something like,</v>

1190
00:59:57.260 --> 00:59:58.400
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't get it.</v>

1191
00:59:59.030 --> 01:00:02.060
<v Speaker 3>The things you do actually do the things</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do or don't do,</v>

1192
01:00:02.061 --> 01:00:02.894
<v Speaker 3>they actually do matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they tilt the world towards </v>

1193
01:00:06.470 --> 01:00:08.660
<v Speaker 3>something approximating good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

1194
01:00:08.750 --> 01:00:12.170
<v Speaker 3>or towards something that very closely </v>
<v Speaker 3>approximates hell.</v>

1195
01:00:12.290 --> 01:00:16.130
<v Speaker 3>And that's actually on you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's literally your fault.</v>

1196
01:00:16.131 --> 01:00:18.650
<v Speaker 3>It's literally your responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1197
01:00:18.860 --> 01:00:20.330
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a terrifying,</v>

1198
01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:21.733
<v Speaker 3>that's a terrifying idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I can't see how you can read this </v>

1199
01:00:24.351 --> 01:00:27.860
<v Speaker 3>literature without coming to that </v>
<v Speaker 3>conclusion.</v>

1200
01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:30.440
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't one that I wanted to leap to.</v>

1201
01:00:30.441 --> 01:00:31.101
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1202
01:00:31.101 --> 01:00:31.401
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1203
01:00:31.401 --> 01:00:32.234
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of the ultimate in horrifying </v>

1204
01:00:33.831 --> 01:00:34.664
<v Speaker 3>conclusions that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that everybody who participated in this </v>

1205
01:00:37.911 --> 01:00:38.744
<v Speaker 3>system was at fault for all of it in on </v>
<v Speaker 3>Dostoyevsky made the same sorts of </v>

1206
01:00:42.051 --> 01:00:42.711
<v Speaker 3>claims in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1207
01:00:42.711 --> 01:00:45.140
<v Speaker 3>in the last part of the 19th century.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1208
01:00:45.141 --> 01:00:47.510
<v Speaker 3>he was a very weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mystical sort of person,</v>

1209
01:00:47.511 --> 01:00:48.344
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he,</v>

1210
01:00:48.380 --> 01:00:50.750
<v Speaker 3>he made claims are some of his </v>
<v Speaker 3>characters did,</v>

1211
01:00:50.751 --> 01:00:52.400
<v Speaker 3>but on his behalf that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1212
01:00:52.401 --> 01:00:54.830
<v Speaker 3>not only are you responsible for </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything you do,</v>

1213
01:00:54.831 --> 01:00:58.460
<v Speaker 3>but in some sense you're responsible for</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything that everyone else does too.</v>

1214
01:00:58.461 --> 01:00:59.294
<v Speaker 3>And you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1215
01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:02.420
<v Speaker 3>obviously there's a way in which that </v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't true.</v>

1216
01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:04.820
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's delusional in some sense,</v>

1217
01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:07.880
<v Speaker 3>but there's another way in which it </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually is true.</v>

1218
01:01:08.330 --> 01:01:10.370
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so well</v>

1219
01:01:10.370 --> 01:01:11.203
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote a book called extreme ownership </v>

1220
01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:13.850
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very inner.</v>

1221
01:01:13.851 --> 01:01:15.830
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so all this is as a whole,</v>

1222
01:01:15.950 --> 01:01:17.750
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought here.</v>

1223
01:01:18.110 --> 01:01:18.891
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1224
01:01:18.891 --> 01:01:22.190
<v Speaker 1>when I read the book about face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not about leadership,</v>

1225
01:01:22.450 --> 01:01:23.283
<v Speaker 1>it's not a leadership book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a book about a guy that was in a </v>

1226
01:01:24.691 --> 01:01:27.170
<v Speaker 1>leadership position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't say here's how you lead,</v>

1227
01:01:27.171 --> 01:01:28.004
<v Speaker 1>here's what you do here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a book about his experience and </v>

1228
01:01:29.331 --> 01:01:30.164
<v Speaker 1>what I took away from it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially because I was in leadership </v>

1229
01:01:32.331 --> 01:01:34.820
<v Speaker 1>positions in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the military,</v>

1230
01:01:34.821 --> 01:01:35.654
<v Speaker 1>in combat situations that I started </v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing all these leadership things that </v>

1231
01:01:38.361 --> 01:01:39.194
<v Speaker 1>he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's all this crossover because </v>

1232
01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:45.500
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so for me the crossover was,</v>

1233
01:01:45.501 --> 01:01:46.334
<v Speaker 1>well I started learning about tactics </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was a young kid cause I was in </v>

1234
01:01:48.711 --> 01:01:49.544
<v Speaker 1>the military and the seal teams and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>had to learn about how to fire and </v>

1235
01:01:51.471 --> 01:01:51.860
<v Speaker 1>maneuver.</v>

1236
01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:52.693
<v Speaker 1>Like that's what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then so you start learning about </v>

1237
01:01:55.101 --> 01:01:55.934
<v Speaker 1>leadership.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I started training a lot of </v>

1238
01:01:57.531 --> 01:02:00.860
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu and so those things kind of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>fit together.</v>

1239
01:02:00.861 --> 01:02:01.694
<v Speaker 1>And it's very strange how those things </v>
<v Speaker 1>started to weave together in my head </v>

1240
01:02:04.610 --> 01:02:05.331
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1241
01:02:05.331 --> 01:02:08.300
<v Speaker 1>if</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the battlefield,</v>

1242
01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:11.390
<v Speaker 1>if you want to attack the enemy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't do it head on you,</v>

1243
01:02:11.420 --> 01:02:12.800
<v Speaker 1>you flank them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you distract him,</v>

1244
01:02:12.801 --> 01:02:13.634
<v Speaker 1>and then you flank them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You come in from the other side in </v>

1245
01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:18.260
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to submit your opponent,</v>

1246
01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:20.010
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't just grab their arm.</v>

1247
01:02:20.011 --> 01:02:20.844
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start to choke them and while </v>

1248
01:02:21.741 --> 01:02:23.580
<v Speaker 1>they're defending the choke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you get their arm.</v>

1249
01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:28.500
<v Speaker 1>And as a leader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want somebody to do something,</v>

1250
01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:29.393
<v Speaker 1>you just don't bark that order at them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You flank them and you let them </v>

1251
01:02:32.371 --> 01:02:33.750
<v Speaker 1>understand why it's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1252
01:02:34.530 --> 01:02:37.710
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I started this podcast that I do,</v>

1253
01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:40.740
<v Speaker 1>I would say I started off by saying in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the beginning I'd say,</v>

1254
01:02:40.741 --> 01:02:41.574
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a podcast about leadership viewed </v>

1255
01:02:43.321 --> 01:02:45.750
<v Speaker 1>through the Lens of war and atrocity.</v>

1256
01:02:47.070 --> 01:02:47.903
<v Speaker 1>And the more I did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it didn't take me very long when I </v>

1257
01:02:49.171 --> 01:02:49.591
<v Speaker 1>was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1258
01:02:49.591 --> 01:02:50.424
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually a podcast about human </v>

1259
01:02:51.481 --> 01:02:53.550
<v Speaker 1>nature really is what it's actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

1260
01:02:53.551 --> 01:02:55.470
<v Speaker 1>Because the better you understand human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings,</v>

1261
01:02:55.471 --> 01:02:56.304
<v Speaker 1>the better you'll be able to do as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>leader because you'll understand what's </v>

1262
01:02:58.081 --> 01:02:58.914
<v Speaker 1>happening with those dynamics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I guess is now leading me into </v>

1263
01:03:00.841 --> 01:03:04.230
<v Speaker 1>some sort of psychology you and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of where you ended up with him.</v>

1264
01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:06.990
<v Speaker 1>Have you read this book?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you said you were studying political</v>

1265
01:03:06.991 --> 01:03:08.550
<v Speaker 1>science when you read this book and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you said,</v>

1266
01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:09.413
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you looked at the psychology of it and </v>

1267
01:03:11.130 --> 01:03:15.540
<v Speaker 1>an example that you just brought up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is just what you learn when you</v>

1268
01:03:15.541 --> 01:03:17.850
<v Speaker 1>read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you understand history and when</v>

1269
01:03:17.851 --> 01:03:20.430
<v Speaker 1>you understand the way people think </v>
<v Speaker 1>stolen,</v>

1270
01:03:20.431 --> 01:03:21.264
<v Speaker 1>surrounded himself with people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would say yes to him and anybody that </v>

1271
01:03:25.981 --> 01:03:27.450
<v Speaker 1>didn't say yes to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he killed them.</v>

1272
01:03:27.810 --> 01:03:28.643
<v Speaker 1>And I'll say this again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll talk to military killed you if you </v>

1273
01:03:30.931 --> 01:03:33.660
<v Speaker 1>said yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1274
01:03:33.990 --> 01:03:34.920
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1275
01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:38.100
<v Speaker 1>I'll talk to eat military for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also any business leader.</v>

1276
01:03:38.101 --> 01:03:39.570
<v Speaker 1>We talked to business leaders all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1277
01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:45.120
<v Speaker 1>And you don't want people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want your subordinates or your</v>

1278
01:03:45.121 --> 01:03:49.680
<v Speaker 1>superiors when you tell them what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to just nod their head and say yes,</v>

1279
01:03:49.860 --> 01:03:51.830
<v Speaker 1>you don't want that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the,</v>

1280
01:03:51.831 --> 01:03:53.190
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the immediate thought,</v>

1281
01:03:53.191 --> 01:03:56.010
<v Speaker 1>especially for a military guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think they're nothing would make my</v>

1282
01:03:56.011 --> 01:03:58.500
<v Speaker 1>job easier than if I bark an order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It you,</v>

1283
01:03:58.501 --> 01:03:59.660
<v Speaker 1>Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you work from Europe,</v>

1284
01:03:59.670 --> 01:04:00.390
<v Speaker 1>private,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nama,</v>

1285
01:04:00.390 --> 01:04:01.820
<v Speaker 1>captain and I barked an order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

1286
01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:02.813
<v Speaker 1>you just shut up and go do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that seems like the best thing in </v>

1287
01:04:04.471 --> 01:04:07.530
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely not true because there's</v>

1288
01:04:07.531 --> 01:04:09.630
<v Speaker 1>things that you know on the front lines </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I don't know.</v>

1289
01:04:09.910 --> 01:04:12.060
<v Speaker 1>And if I really want to be a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>leader,</v>

1290
01:04:12.090 --> 01:04:14.820
<v Speaker 1>I want you to push back on me and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey boss,</v>

1291
01:04:15.090 --> 01:04:16.170
<v Speaker 1>we don't want to do that.</v>

1292
01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:17.940
<v Speaker 1>Here's what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell you the situation.</v>

1293
01:04:18.380 --> 01:04:20.310
<v Speaker 1>And instead of making,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to be able to do that,</v>

1294
01:04:20.311 --> 01:04:21.144
<v Speaker 1>you want to be able to teach your </v>
<v Speaker 1>subordinates to do that without being </v>

1295
01:04:22.951 --> 01:04:24.270
<v Speaker 1>insubordinate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1296
01:04:24.271 --> 01:04:26.210
<v Speaker 1>Cause then it's not a power play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that your,</v>

1297
01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:28.800
<v Speaker 1>your interests are aligned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our interests are aligned.</v>

1298
01:04:28.830 --> 01:04:30.870
<v Speaker 1>And I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I talked to the subordinates,</v>

1299
01:04:30.871 --> 01:04:32.730
<v Speaker 1>cause I talked to subordinates to yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I say,</v>

1300
01:04:32.731 --> 01:04:34.590
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you say something to your boss,</v>

1301
01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:37.410
<v Speaker 1>you don't say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why the hell are we doing that boss?</v>

1302
01:04:37.980 --> 01:04:39.530
<v Speaker 1>You actually have to be very tactful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1303
01:04:39.770 --> 01:04:40.650
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1304
01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:41.491
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey boss.</v>

1305
01:04:41.491 --> 01:04:42.324
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to make sure I'm executing this </v>

1306
01:04:44.221 --> 01:04:45.054
<v Speaker 1>exactly how you want it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you explain to me why we're doing </v>

1307
01:04:46.651 --> 01:04:47.700
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I can really,</v>

1308
01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:49.950
<v Speaker 1>really make it happen out there in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>field.</v>

1309
01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:52.320
<v Speaker 1>And that's a key thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1310
01:04:52.410 --> 01:04:54.600
<v Speaker 1>so these ideas of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1311
01:04:55.400 --> 01:04:57.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology I guess now as,</v>

1312
01:04:57.271 --> 01:04:58.104
<v Speaker 1>and I hate to use that word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because I was just calling it human </v>

1313
01:05:01.111 --> 01:05:01.980
<v Speaker 1>nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these ideas,</v>

1314
01:05:01.981 --> 01:05:03.180
<v Speaker 1>they all kind of come together.</v>

1315
01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:06.930
<v Speaker 1>And so now you're talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>ownership,</v>

1316
01:05:06.931 --> 01:05:08.550
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Extreme ownership and this idea that,</v>

1317
01:05:09.090 --> 01:05:10.800
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm responsible for everything.</v>

1318
01:05:11.010 --> 01:05:13.020
<v Speaker 1>And so here's what I'll get from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>leader.</v>

1319
01:05:14.370 --> 01:05:16.110
<v Speaker 1>They'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1320
01:05:16.111 --> 01:05:18.850
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a business leader or it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very easy to use a military leader.</v>

1321
01:05:18.910 --> 01:05:19.743
<v Speaker 1>So I'll get a platoon commander,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my machine gunner shot in the wrong </v>

1322
01:05:22.271 --> 01:05:25.150
<v Speaker 1>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can that be my fault?</v>

1323
01:05:26.470 --> 01:05:28.270
<v Speaker 1>Because my machine gun a shot in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong direction.</v>

1324
01:05:28.271 --> 01:05:29.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not holding his weapon.</v>

1325
01:05:29.621 --> 01:05:32.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm not pulling his shirt from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can that possibly be my fault?</v>

1326
01:05:32.531 --> 01:05:34.870
<v Speaker 1>That's not my fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] wrong.</v>

1327
01:05:35.590 --> 01:05:36.423
<v Speaker 1>Who's in charge of that machine gun?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's in charge of making sure he </v>

1328
01:05:38.171 --> 01:05:39.004
<v Speaker 1>understands what it's fields of fire?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's in charge of making sure he </v>

1329
01:05:41.081 --> 01:05:43.390
<v Speaker 1>understands when and where he's allowed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to shoot you are,</v>

1330
01:05:43.391 --> 01:05:45.130
<v Speaker 1>you're the boss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is absolutely your fault.</v>

1331
01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:46.153
<v Speaker 1>Had it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1332
01:05:46.290 --> 01:05:48.520
<v Speaker 1>another interesting example of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>weather,</v>

1333
01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:50.560
<v Speaker 1>the weather's bad.</v>

1334
01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:53.290
<v Speaker 1>We couldn't execute our mission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why we failed because we couldn't</v>

1335
01:05:53.291 --> 01:05:55.240
<v Speaker 1>launch our helicopters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not my fault.</v>

1336
01:05:56.890 --> 01:05:58.160
<v Speaker 1>That's a hard one to argue against.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1337
01:05:58.270 --> 01:06:00.640
<v Speaker 1>Except for the fact that if you're a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good leader,</v>

1338
01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:01.653
<v Speaker 1>you'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1339
01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:03.580
<v Speaker 1>here's our plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to use these helicopters and</v>

1340
01:06:03.581 --> 01:06:05.470
<v Speaker 1>here's our contingency plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there's bad weather,</v>

1341
01:06:06.250 --> 01:06:08.860
<v Speaker 1>if you don't take that ownership of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on,</v>

1342
01:06:08.890 --> 01:06:12.100
<v Speaker 1>if you don't take responsibility for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to change it.</v>

1343
01:06:12.101 --> 01:06:12.934
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that means you're never getting any </v>

1344
01:06:15.461 --> 01:06:16.570
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to win.</v>

1345
01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:19.150
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the minute you as and this,</v>

1346
01:06:19.151 --> 01:06:23.650
<v Speaker 1>and obviously this applies to you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people to purple,</v>

1347
01:06:23.651 --> 01:06:25.480
<v Speaker 1>then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you tell people take responsibility.</v>

1348
01:06:25.490 --> 01:06:26.090
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1349
01:06:26.090 --> 01:06:26.923
<v Speaker 1>tell him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take ownership of what's going on in </v>

1350
01:06:27.341 --> 01:06:28.760
<v Speaker 1>your world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's this,</v>

1351
01:06:28.770 --> 01:06:29.950
<v Speaker 1>it's the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

1352
01:06:30.380 --> 01:06:31.161
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's also,</v>

1353
01:06:31.161 --> 01:06:31.994
<v Speaker 3>it's also seems to me to be the case and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that this is part of the ethic </v>

1354
01:06:35.901 --> 01:06:37.640
<v Speaker 3>that's embedded in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1355
01:06:38.060 --> 01:06:41.150
<v Speaker 3>it's deeply embedded in Christianity </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the idea that</v>

1356
01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:43.753
<v Speaker 3>the idea that the ultimate sacrifice </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you can offer to the world is the </v>

1357
01:06:46.221 --> 01:06:48.140
<v Speaker 3>sacrifice of yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1358
01:06:48.141 --> 01:06:48.974
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>imagine that you have to sacrifice </v>

1359
01:06:49.791 --> 01:06:51.980
<v Speaker 3>something to set the world right while </v>
<v Speaker 3>you do,</v>

1360
01:06:51.981 --> 01:06:52.814
<v Speaker 3>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you have to give up things now </v>

1361
01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:56.960
<v Speaker 3>in order to make things better in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>future.</v>

1362
01:06:56.961 --> 01:06:59.300
<v Speaker 3>So the sacrificial ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a very deep one,</v>

1363
01:06:59.690 --> 01:07:01.070
<v Speaker 3>then the question might be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1364
01:07:01.730 --> 01:07:02.563
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to sacrifice something </v>

1365
01:07:03.411 --> 01:07:05.510
<v Speaker 3>isn't going to be someone else or is it </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be you?</v>

1366
01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:07.333
<v Speaker 3>And I really think that's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamental question and the right </v>

1367
01:07:09.201 --> 01:07:11.000
<v Speaker 3>answer to that is that it's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

1368
01:07:11.150 --> 01:07:12.440
<v Speaker 3>It's your fault,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1369
01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:16.220
<v Speaker 3>You take that on or at least you take on</v>
<v Speaker 3>that responsibility and it is,</v>

1370
01:07:16.490 --> 01:07:18.300
<v Speaker 3>it's a weird thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>weird lead,</v>

1371
01:07:18.301 --> 01:07:21.050
<v Speaker 3>difficult to distinguish fault and </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibility.</v>

1372
01:07:21.290 --> 01:07:23.990
<v Speaker 3>I think responsibility is the better way</v>
<v Speaker 3>of thinking about it,</v>

1373
01:07:23.991 --> 01:07:27.620
<v Speaker 3>but it's tied in with the idea of fault.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it doesn't go right,</v>

1374
01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:30.860
<v Speaker 3>if it isn't going right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's because you're not good enough.</v>

1375
01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:33.970
<v Speaker 3>Now that can be crushing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is a problem with that like,</v>

1376
01:07:33.980 --> 01:07:38.870
<v Speaker 3>and you see sometimes people who develop</v>
<v Speaker 3>like psychotic depression and they um,</v>

1377
01:07:39.070 --> 01:07:39.903
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they suffer from a delusional condition </v>

1378
01:07:42.350 --> 01:07:43.183
<v Speaker 3>in some sense that the entire moral </v>
<v Speaker 3>catastrophe of the world is literally </v>

1379
01:07:47.031 --> 01:07:50.750
<v Speaker 3>their fault and that's not there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's an element of that that's,</v>

1380
01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:54.140
<v Speaker 3>that's not productive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although there's a truth in it as well,</v>

1381
01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:55.201
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1382
01:07:55.201 --> 01:07:56.034
<v Speaker 3>and it's hard to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to find the balance so that </v>

1383
01:07:58.701 --> 01:07:59.534
<v Speaker 3>you can take on that responsibility </v>
<v Speaker 3>without simultaneously being a crushing </v>

1384
01:08:02.571 --> 01:08:03.404
<v Speaker 3>weight because there's a lot of things </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the world that are really not good </v>

1385
01:08:05.391 --> 01:08:08.450
<v Speaker 3>and if they're your fault,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's rather hard on you.</v>

1386
01:08:08.810 --> 01:08:09.643
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that the Catholic </v>

1387
01:08:11.391 --> 01:08:15.140
<v Speaker 3>church does to help people with that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it gives them the opportunity,</v>

1388
01:08:15.170 --> 01:08:17.600
<v Speaker 3>do sort of wash their sins off </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves,</v>

1389
01:08:17.601 --> 01:08:19.160
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can go to church and you can say,</v>

1390
01:08:19.161 --> 01:08:19.994
<v Speaker 3>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's a bunch of ways that I've been </v>

1391
01:08:21.380 --> 01:08:25.550
<v Speaker 3>being not who I could be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the Church authorities say,</v>

1392
01:08:25.551 --> 01:08:26.384
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1393
01:08:26.810 --> 01:08:30.170
<v Speaker 3>that's not good and you should </v>
<v Speaker 3>straighten up and all of that and fly,</v>

1394
01:08:30.171 --> 01:08:33.320
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But human beings are fallible and you're</v>

1395
01:08:33.321 --> 01:08:35.110
<v Speaker 3>fallible and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1396
01:08:35.111 --> 01:08:40.100
<v Speaker 3>and we can't just crush you because of </v>
<v Speaker 3>your insufficiency.</v>

1397
01:08:40.101 --> 01:08:43.540
<v Speaker 3>So we'll wash the slate clean and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can go out there and try again.</v>

1398
01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:46.430
<v Speaker 3>And it's very hard to get the balance </v>
<v Speaker 3>between those things,</v>

1399
01:08:46.431 --> 01:08:47.264
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that you can take the responsibility </v>

1400
01:08:49.341 --> 01:08:51.230
<v Speaker 3>on without being crushed by it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1401
01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:52.633
<v Speaker 3>but it's still the case that it seems to</v>
<v Speaker 3>me that it's either your fault or it's </v>

1402
01:08:55.821 --> 01:08:58.610
<v Speaker 3>someone else's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and as soon as it's someone else's,</v>

1403
01:08:58.611 --> 01:08:59.444
<v Speaker 3>then you better be careful because that </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea that it's someone else's is </v>

1404
01:09:02.751 --> 01:09:04.910
<v Speaker 3>definitely going to appeal to the worst </v>
<v Speaker 3>in you.</v>

1405
01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.550
<v Speaker 3>That's definitely going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you don't see that,</v>

1406
01:09:07.551 --> 01:09:11.230
<v Speaker 3>then you're naive or willfully blind </v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1407
01:09:11.231 --> 01:09:15.620
<v Speaker 3>and all that is going to do all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All that that is going to do is make the</v>

1408
01:09:15.621 --> 01:09:17.420
<v Speaker 3>situation worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1409
01:09:17.421 --> 01:09:18.470
<v Speaker 3>Especially because</v>

1410
01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:21.960
<v Speaker 1>if it's not my fault and it's your fault</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I can't control you,</v>

1411
01:09:21.961 --> 01:09:22.794
<v Speaker 1>what do I do about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sit there and just suffer the </v>

1412
01:09:25.411 --> 01:09:28.290
<v Speaker 1>consequences of the situation as opposed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1413
01:09:28.350 --> 01:09:30.090
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what's going on.</v>

1414
01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:31.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take responsibility and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ownership for it.</v>

1415
01:09:31.981 --> 01:09:33.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna Change it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make it happen.</v>

1416
01:09:35.250 --> 01:09:36.083
<v Speaker 1>You talked about turning a blind eye and</v>
<v Speaker 1>an earlier you talked about turning a </v>

1417
01:09:39.211 --> 01:09:43.580
<v Speaker 1>blind eye to the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a situation.</v>

1418
01:09:43.610 --> 01:09:48.610
<v Speaker 1>And I know there's a point in this book </v>
<v Speaker 1>where he talks about the,</v>

1419
01:09:49.170 --> 01:09:52.140
<v Speaker 1>he's got a buddy that says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amnesty is coming,</v>

1420
01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:53.760
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amnesty is coming.</v>

1421
01:09:54.450 --> 01:09:58.620
<v Speaker 1>Let's just keep our mouth shut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's do what we're told to do and we'll</v>

1422
01:09:58.621 --> 01:09:58.970
<v Speaker 1>get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1423
01:09:58.970 --> 01:10:00.180
<v Speaker 1>we'll get out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazon's coming.</v>

1424
01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:03.570
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Solzhenitsyn says,</v>

1425
01:10:03.930 --> 01:10:04.651
<v Speaker 1>he saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1426
01:10:04.651 --> 01:10:06.030
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he says to himself,</v>

1427
01:10:06.031 --> 01:10:08.370
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm not,</v>

1428
01:10:10.170 --> 01:10:15.170
<v Speaker 1>if I'm not living in order to live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then is it worth it?</v>

1429
01:10:17.130 --> 01:10:21.690
<v Speaker 1>And this is a question that I get asked </v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot because people get themselves into</v>

1430
01:10:21.691 --> 01:10:26.691
<v Speaker 1>situations</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they've lost some kind of control,</v>

1431
01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:31.860
<v Speaker 1>whether it's they're in a crappy job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they've got a bad boss or whatever.</v>

1432
01:10:32.970 --> 01:10:36.230
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they're in a bad relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe their families,</v>

1433
01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:39.160
<v Speaker 1>but they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're in a situation and they,</v>

1434
01:10:39.161 --> 01:10:44.161
<v Speaker 1>and they don't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of them I think anticipates the</v>

1435
01:10:45.931 --> 01:10:48.420
<v Speaker 1>answer from me to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

1436
01:10:48.570 --> 01:10:49.410
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

1437
01:10:49.710 --> 01:10:53.250
<v Speaker 1>if you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're not living in order to live,</v>

1438
01:10:53.251 --> 01:10:54.120
<v Speaker 1>then that's wrong.</v>

1439
01:10:56.700 --> 01:11:01.590
<v Speaker 1>But what I actually tell them </v>
<v Speaker 1>universally almost,</v>

1440
01:11:02.070 --> 01:11:05.040
<v Speaker 1>and there's a couple situations where it</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes outside this,</v>

1441
01:11:05.041 --> 01:11:06.330
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the,</v>

1442
01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:11.220
<v Speaker 1>what I tell them is what you need to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now is you need to play the game.</v>

1443
01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:16.700
<v Speaker 1>You need to play the game to get the </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation to a point where you can act,</v>

1444
01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:18.780
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're,</v>

1445
01:11:18.781 --> 01:11:19.800
<v Speaker 1>you've got a bad boss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1446
01:11:19.801 --> 01:11:20.281
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1447
01:11:20.281 --> 01:11:21.300
<v Speaker 1>you okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to buy Boston.</v>

1448
01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:22.910
<v Speaker 1>I want to tell this guy to go screw </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

1449
01:11:23.490 --> 01:11:24.323
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guess what I'm going to do when my boss </v>

1450
01:11:25.681 --> 01:11:27.510
<v Speaker 1>tells me something to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make much sense.</v>

1451
01:11:27.511 --> 01:11:28.344
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm gonna do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna do it and I'm going to do it </v>

1452
01:11:29.731 --> 01:11:30.564
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what am I doing on building that </v>

1453
01:11:31.441 --> 01:11:32.274
<v Speaker 1>relationship with him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He started to trust me and he's gonna </v>

1454
01:11:33.571 --> 01:11:34.710
<v Speaker 1>tell me to do something else.</v>

1455
01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:38.790
<v Speaker 1>Now these things are massive cutoffs </v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophes.</v>

1456
01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:39.840
<v Speaker 1>It's like he's telling me to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

1457
01:11:39.841 --> 01:11:40.674
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's a better way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't even know how to do it that </v>

1458
01:11:41.941 --> 01:11:45.150
<v Speaker 1>way and I'm going to play that game and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to build up that relationship.</v>

1459
01:11:45.151 --> 01:11:50.151
<v Speaker 1>Now when eventually he tells me to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that is totally stupid or it's</v>

1460
01:11:50.401 --> 01:11:51.360
<v Speaker 1>gonna cost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1461
01:11:51.390 --> 01:11:53.370
<v Speaker 1>lives or money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then when I say,</v>

1462
01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:56.730
<v Speaker 1>hey boss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not a great way to do it.</v>

1463
01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:58.950
<v Speaker 1>I think I know a better way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can we try something else?</v>

1464
01:11:58.980 --> 01:11:59.813
<v Speaker 1>He actually will listen to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to play the game a little </v>

1465
01:12:02.251 --> 01:12:07.251
<v Speaker 1>bit and I'll tell you my gut instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If now I guess it's,</v>

1466
01:12:07.490 --> 01:12:09.300
<v Speaker 1>it's easy to look from the outside and </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

1467
01:12:09.301 --> 01:12:10.470
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I was in this prison camp,</v>

1468
01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:11.670
<v Speaker 1>my gut instinct is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1469
01:12:11.671 --> 01:12:12.504
<v Speaker 1>Jack would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1470
01:12:12.510 --> 01:12:13.890
<v Speaker 1>you've been through these kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things before,</v>

1471
01:12:14.010 --> 01:12:14.760
<v Speaker 1>play the game.</v>

1472
01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:15.593
<v Speaker 1>You're going to play the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is horrifying because part of </v>

1473
01:12:18.631 --> 01:12:19.464
<v Speaker 1>playing that game to the fullest extent </v>
<v Speaker 1>here or in a Nazi prison camp would be </v>

1474
01:12:23.071 --> 01:12:24.390
<v Speaker 1>coming to capitol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1475
01:12:24.391 --> 01:12:25.240
<v Speaker 1>you're playing the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1476
01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:26.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're playing the game.</v>

1477
01:12:26.521 --> 01:12:27.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1478
01:12:27.540 --> 01:12:28.373
<v Speaker 1>and that's really the outlying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that I said that our </v>

1479
01:12:30.391 --> 01:12:31.224
<v Speaker 1>outlying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always make the caveat that if you're </v>

1480
01:12:32.611 --> 01:12:34.860
<v Speaker 1>getting asked to do something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>immoral,</v>

1481
01:12:34.890 --> 01:12:36.330
<v Speaker 1>illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or unethical,</v>

1482
01:12:36.540 --> 01:12:38.100
<v Speaker 1>then you actually have a duty to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1483
01:12:38.101 --> 01:12:39.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1484
01:12:39.220 --> 01:12:40.740
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the line which you know,</v>

1485
01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:45.090
<v Speaker 1>which you reach that line in the sand </v>
<v Speaker 1>with bill [inaudible] 16 what,</v>

1486
01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:45.541
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1487
01:12:45.541 --> 01:12:46.374
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the idea that sometimes you got to </v>

1488
01:12:52.621 --> 01:12:55.080
<v Speaker 1>play the game and sometimes even from </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1489
01:12:55.081 --> 01:12:56.580
<v Speaker 1>when you just said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

1490
01:12:56.581 --> 01:12:57.061
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1491
01:12:57.061 --> 01:12:57.894
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not right to turn a blind eye on </v>

1492
01:13:00.541 --> 01:13:02.280
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like</v>

1493
01:13:04.230 --> 01:13:05.063
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to get yourself to a </v>

1494
01:13:07.261 --> 01:13:09.170
<v Speaker 1>position like mine,</v>

1495
01:13:09.870 --> 01:13:10.703
<v Speaker 3>it seems to me that you're making a </v>
<v Speaker 3>distinction between discipline and </v>

1496
01:13:13.171 --> 01:13:17.640
<v Speaker 3>strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like an end and and like impulsive moral</v>

1497
01:13:17.641 --> 01:13:18.690
<v Speaker 3>responding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1498
01:13:18.691 --> 01:13:19.524
<v Speaker 3>like let's say that you are in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation where you have a boss who's </v>

1499
01:13:21.690 --> 01:13:24.480
<v Speaker 3>intolerable and maybe what you'd like to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>

1500
01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:25.553
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the resentment is built up over five </v>

1501
01:13:27.091 --> 01:13:27.924
<v Speaker 3>years and you'd like to go in there and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and yell at him and tell him everything </v>

1502
01:13:30.811 --> 01:13:32.130
<v Speaker 3>you think and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1503
01:13:32.131 --> 01:13:33.450
<v Speaker 3>that's the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1504
01:13:33.451 --> 01:13:34.770
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's actually,</v>

1505
01:13:34.860 --> 01:13:35.693
<v Speaker 3>it's not a very sophisticated truth </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're doing as shallow and </v>

1506
01:13:39.121 --> 01:13:39.954
<v Speaker 3>impulsive analysis of the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it would have been the case that </v>

1507
01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:47.820
<v Speaker 3>you've already compromised yourself in </v>
<v Speaker 3>500 ways.</v>

1508
01:13:47.821 --> 01:13:48.654
<v Speaker 3>And I'll get back to the playing the </v>
<v Speaker 3>game issue because you do have to </v>

1509
01:13:51.061 --> 01:13:55.340
<v Speaker 3>discipline yourself to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you have to discipline yourself to,</v>

1510
01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:56.393
<v Speaker 3>to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by allowing yourself to do arbitrary </v>

1511
01:13:59.131 --> 01:14:01.020
<v Speaker 3>things that are part of the system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1512
01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:01.853
<v Speaker 3>That's a necessary part of discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And discriminating that from a </v>

1513
01:14:06.330 --> 01:14:09.930
<v Speaker 3>compliance with unethical activity is </v>
<v Speaker 3>very difficult.</v>

1514
01:14:09.931 --> 01:14:13.660
<v Speaker 3>So that's a hard situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But let's say you're,</v>

1515
01:14:13.661 --> 01:14:14.494
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to counsel someone who has </v>

1516
01:14:15.791 --> 01:14:18.610
<v Speaker 3>an intolerable boss and they come in and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're right at the end of their tether</v>

1517
01:14:18.611 --> 01:14:20.320
<v Speaker 3>because maybe that's why they come for </v>
<v Speaker 3>counseling.</v>

1518
01:14:20.321 --> 01:14:21.154
<v Speaker 3>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really want to tell that son of a </v>

1519
01:14:21.701 --> 01:14:23.140
<v Speaker 3>bitch what I think of him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you think,</v>

1520
01:14:23.141 --> 01:14:24.850
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait a second here.</v>

1521
01:14:25.210 --> 01:14:26.200
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

1522
01:14:27.010 --> 01:14:32.010
<v Speaker 3>you've already eradicated from the list </v>
<v Speaker 3>of reasonable possibilities.</v>

1523
01:14:33.490 --> 01:14:34.323
<v Speaker 3>That decision by failing to say small </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that you could have said all the </v>

1524
01:14:39.821 --> 01:14:40.654
<v Speaker 3>way along.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's not like you can just all of a </v>

1525
01:14:42.101 --> 01:14:42.934
<v Speaker 3>sudden blurt all of that out now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that wipes the slate clean and that </v>

1526
01:14:46.481 --> 01:14:49.930
<v Speaker 3>constitutes truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's too unsophisticated.</v>

1527
01:14:49.931 --> 01:14:50.830
<v Speaker 3>So let's think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1528
01:14:50.831 --> 01:14:52.750
<v Speaker 3>so what is it that you want?</v>

1529
01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:54.430
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want this job anymore.</v>

1530
01:14:54.580 --> 01:14:55.413
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1531
01:14:55.660 --> 01:14:56.493
<v Speaker 3>now let,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's actually have a strategy about </v>

1532
01:14:58.031 --> 01:14:59.740
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you don't want this job anymore.</v>

1533
01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:03.100
<v Speaker 3>Can you get another job?</v>
<v Speaker 3>While I don't think so.</v>

1534
01:15:03.610 --> 01:15:05.800
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you can't just quit.</v>

1535
01:15:05.801 --> 01:15:07.630
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no I can't because then I don't have any</v>

1536
01:15:07.631 --> 01:15:09.430
<v Speaker 3>money in my family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Depends on the job.</v>

1537
01:15:09.460 --> 01:15:10.031
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1538
01:15:10.031 --> 01:15:12.240
<v Speaker 3>so you can't just stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This does,</v>

1539
01:15:12.241 --> 01:15:13.074
<v Speaker 3>that's not a viable solution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You go out of the frying pan into the </v>

1540
01:15:15.401 --> 01:15:17.800
<v Speaker 3>fire or you know you suck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you suck.</v>

1541
01:15:17.950 --> 01:15:18.783
<v Speaker 3>You substitute one set of unethical </v>
<v Speaker 3>actions for another set of unethical </v>

1542
01:15:22.181 --> 01:15:24.490
<v Speaker 3>actions that are even worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not helpful.</v>

1543
01:15:24.850 --> 01:15:25.683
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so let's start thinking about what </v>

1544
01:15:27.551 --> 01:15:29.740
<v Speaker 3>exactly it is that you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1545
01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:31.810
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe I want a better job.</v>

1546
01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:34.090
<v Speaker 3>I want to work for someone who is more </v>
<v Speaker 3>reasonable.</v>

1547
01:15:34.330 --> 01:15:35.740
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what's stopping you?</v>

1548
01:15:36.070 --> 01:15:38.350
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have my cv in order.</v>

1549
01:15:38.710 --> 01:15:40.660
<v Speaker 3>My resume isn't up to date.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1550
01:15:40.661 --> 01:15:41.471
<v Speaker 3>why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1551
01:15:41.471 --> 01:15:43.570
<v Speaker 3>I haven't done it for five years and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't like doing it.</v>

1552
01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:44.433
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why is that?</v>

1553
01:15:44.530 --> 01:15:45.363
<v Speaker 3>Well because I'm kind of embarrassed </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it because it has holes in it and </v>

1554
01:15:47.291 --> 01:15:50.920
<v Speaker 3>it shows where I'm lackadaisical and </v>
<v Speaker 3>where I'm not prepared.</v>

1555
01:15:50.921 --> 01:15:51.754
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1556
01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:53.620
<v Speaker 3>how many things are there like that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1557
01:15:53.621 --> 01:15:56.830
<v Speaker 3>there's a bunch of things and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>all associated with how I procrastinated</v>

1558
01:15:56.831 --> 01:15:58.060
<v Speaker 3>in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1559
01:15:58.061 --> 01:16:00.280
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are we going to do to rectify that?</v>

1560
01:16:00.460 --> 01:16:04.030
<v Speaker 3>So I'll say to people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why don't you update your cv that that's</v>

1561
01:16:04.031 --> 01:16:04.864
<v Speaker 3>what we'll do first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because if you're going to look for a </v>

1562
01:16:05.981 --> 01:16:06.814
<v Speaker 3>different job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying you're going to look for </v>

1563
01:16:07.841 --> 01:16:08.674
<v Speaker 3>a different job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you're going to look for a </v>

1564
01:16:10.661 --> 01:16:12.160
<v Speaker 3>different job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to,</v>

1565
01:16:12.161 --> 01:16:16.900
<v Speaker 3>unless your cvs updated [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 3>unless you can get a good recommendation</v>

1566
01:16:16.901 --> 01:16:18.430
<v Speaker 3>from this boss that's a tyrant.</v>

1567
01:16:18.650 --> 01:16:19.390
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

1568
01:16:19.390 --> 01:16:20.223
<v Speaker 3>you've got to play the game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's 10 of strategic actions that </v>

1569
01:16:23.621 --> 01:16:24.454
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have to take in order to</v>
<v Speaker 3>make yourself able to move laterally or </v>

1570
01:16:27.671 --> 01:16:28.504
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the truth is isn't going in and </v>

1571
01:16:31.061 --> 01:16:33.560
<v Speaker 3>yelling at your boss and telling them </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything you think about it.</v>

1572
01:16:33.580 --> 01:16:36.610
<v Speaker 3>The truth is trying to figure out the </v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

1573
01:16:36.611 --> 01:16:39.820
<v Speaker 3>very difficult process of how you put </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself in a better position.</v>

1574
01:16:40.060 --> 01:16:42.820
<v Speaker 3>And that that are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that's quite fun about</v>

1575
01:16:42.970 --> 01:16:47.140
<v Speaker 3>this lecture tour is the letters that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>received or the stories that people tell</v>

1576
01:16:47.141 --> 01:16:50.740
<v Speaker 3>me about switching jobs because they do </v>
<v Speaker 3>realize that there,</v>

1577
01:16:50.860 --> 01:16:54.630
<v Speaker 3>and I often talk to people about </v>
<v Speaker 3>consulting their resentment.</v>

1578
01:16:55.290 --> 01:16:58.600
<v Speaker 3>Resentment is a really useful emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's really dangerous.</v>

1579
01:16:59.380 --> 01:17:01.960
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the most dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychological states,</v>

1580
01:17:01.961 --> 01:17:02.794
<v Speaker 3>I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's unbelievably useful because </v>

1581
01:17:04.460 --> 01:17:07.690
<v Speaker 3>resentment usually only means one of two</v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

1582
01:17:07.900 --> 01:17:08.733
<v Speaker 3>It either means quit whining and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and take it on because you're immature </v>

1583
01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:14.113
<v Speaker 3>or it means you're allowing yourself to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be taken advantage of and you have </v>

1584
01:17:17.121 --> 01:17:17.954
<v Speaker 3>something to say or do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you want to sort out the first </v>

1585
01:17:21.140 --> 01:17:21.973
<v Speaker 3>part and find out if you're just being </v>
<v Speaker 3>immature and you can think that through </v>

1586
01:17:24.141 --> 01:17:26.030
<v Speaker 3>and you can talk to people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1587
01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:27.591
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>

1588
01:17:27.591 --> 01:17:29.060
<v Speaker 3>but if it's the second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1589
01:17:29.061 --> 01:17:30.950
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've compromised yourself in a variety</v>

1590
01:17:30.951 --> 01:17:33.050
<v Speaker 3>of ways and you have to figure out how </v>
<v Speaker 3>to get out of that.</v>

1591
01:17:33.260 --> 01:17:34.093
<v Speaker 3>And if you're resentful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's evidence that you have in fact </v>

1592
01:17:37.461 --> 01:17:38.420
<v Speaker 3>done that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1593
01:17:38.421 --> 01:17:39.890
<v Speaker 3>so now that issue would be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1594
01:17:39.891 --> 01:17:43.400
<v Speaker 3>how can you set your life up so that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can be without that resentment?</v>

1595
01:17:43.730 --> 01:17:46.310
<v Speaker 3>And so that's when you start to develop </v>
<v Speaker 3>a strategy for,</v>

1596
01:17:46.670 --> 01:17:47.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1597
01:17:47.100 --> 01:17:47.933
<v Speaker 3>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's actually an adventure in this </v>

1598
01:17:49.581 --> 01:17:49.850
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

1599
01:17:49.850 --> 01:17:50.683
<v Speaker 3>I mean I've had a number of clients who </v>
<v Speaker 3>have been in jobs that they didn't like </v>

1600
01:17:54.081 --> 01:17:56.660
<v Speaker 3>it all and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were tyrannized by someone,</v>

1601
01:17:56.661 --> 01:17:57.494
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they were also working below their </v>

1602
01:17:59.331 --> 01:18:01.910
<v Speaker 3>hypothetical level and we'd put together</v>
<v Speaker 3>a plan.</v>

1603
01:18:01.911 --> 01:18:02.744
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1604
01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:05.810
<v Speaker 3>you're going to make three times as much</v>
<v Speaker 3>money in five years.</v>

1605
01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:08.960
<v Speaker 3>That's the plan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like that's not going to be simple.</v>

1606
01:18:09.050 --> 01:18:11.090
<v Speaker 3>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's education,</v>

1607
01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:14.030
<v Speaker 3>you gotta educate yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe formerly cause you've got holes,</v>

1608
01:18:14.180 --> 01:18:16.550
<v Speaker 3>you got to fix up your resume,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got to,</v>

1609
01:18:16.940 --> 01:18:19.130
<v Speaker 3>you've got to overcome your fear of </v>
<v Speaker 3>being interviewed.</v>

1610
01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:24.350
<v Speaker 3>You have to start sending out like 50 </v>
<v Speaker 3>resumes a week on a regular basis and be</v>

1611
01:18:24.351 --> 01:18:27.080
<v Speaker 3>prepared for a 99% rejection rate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

1612
01:18:27.100 --> 01:18:28.460
<v Speaker 3>you're going to look for a different </v>
<v Speaker 3>job.</v>

1613
01:18:28.461 --> 01:18:29.294
<v Speaker 3>It's probably going to take six months </v>
<v Speaker 3>to a year and almost all of that is </v>

1614
01:18:31.491 --> 01:18:35.930
<v Speaker 3>going to be rejection and you got to </v>
<v Speaker 3>steel yourself from for that and prepare</v>

1615
01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:38.180
<v Speaker 3>and maybe this is going to be a three </v>
<v Speaker 3>year process.</v>

1616
01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:41.210
<v Speaker 3>It's no trivial thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1617
01:18:41.450 --> 01:18:42.283
<v Speaker 3>it's almost inevitably can't remember a </v>
<v Speaker 3>single example where the consequence of </v>

1618
01:18:47.781 --> 01:18:50.090
<v Speaker 3>that very careful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>detailed,</v>

1619
01:18:50.091 --> 01:18:55.091
<v Speaker 3>strategic thinking wasn't a massively </v>
<v Speaker 3>substantive improvement in socioeconomic</v>

1620
01:18:56.841 --> 01:18:59.570
<v Speaker 3>positioning and a great movement </v>
<v Speaker 3>towards,</v>

1621
01:18:59.990 --> 01:19:02.310
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>improving trajectory and,</v>

1622
01:19:02.340 --> 01:19:03.173
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's advantages even along the </v>

1623
01:19:04.281 --> 01:19:05.114
<v Speaker 3>way because even before that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact that you're taking genuine </v>

1624
01:19:08.541 --> 01:19:09.374
<v Speaker 3>steps to put yourself in a better </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation immediately starts to reduce </v>

1625
01:19:13.221 --> 01:19:14.054
<v Speaker 3>your resentment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if it isn't having positive </v>

1626
01:19:15.291 --> 01:19:18.260
<v Speaker 3>consequences to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you have to be realistic about it.</v>

1627
01:19:18.261 --> 01:19:18.981
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1628
01:19:18.981 --> 01:19:19.814
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be hard to update your cv </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're embarrassed about it and </v>

1629
01:19:21.561 --> 01:19:22.394
<v Speaker 3>you should be all right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's no wonder you're embarrassed about </v>

1630
01:19:24.201 --> 01:19:24.890
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

1631
01:19:24.890 --> 01:19:25.723
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course you don't want to go be </v>

1632
01:19:26.601 --> 01:19:28.250
<v Speaker 3>interviewed because you're not very good</v>
<v Speaker 3>at it.</v>

1633
01:19:28.251 --> 01:19:30.690
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's holes in your story and,</v>

1634
01:19:30.700 --> 01:19:31.533
<v Speaker 3>and your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can be made nervous easily and </v>

1635
01:19:33.351 --> 01:19:35.020
<v Speaker 3>you're not a very good advocate for </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself.</v>

1636
01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:37.400
<v Speaker 3>So there's a lot of improvement that </v>
<v Speaker 3>needs to be done there.</v>

1637
01:19:37.650 --> 01:19:40.830
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you have to withstand the,</v>

1638
01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:42.410
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1639
01:19:42.530 --> 01:19:46.790
<v Speaker 3>the punishment of being constantly </v>
<v Speaker 3>rejected when you apply for jobs because</v>

1640
01:19:46.791 --> 01:19:48.890
<v Speaker 3>the baseline rejection rate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1641
01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:50.630
<v Speaker 3>for the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the typical job,</v>

1642
01:19:50.631 --> 01:19:51.464
<v Speaker 3>applicant is like 99%.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the rejection rate for </v>

1643
01:19:53.571 --> 01:19:55.160
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is this going to work?</v>

1644
01:19:55.220 --> 01:19:57.380
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you do it a hundred times,</v>

1645
01:19:57.560 --> 01:19:59.960
<v Speaker 3>it might work once and that's all you </v>
<v Speaker 3>need.</v>

1646
01:19:59.990 --> 01:20:01.160
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>

1647
01:20:01.161 --> 01:20:01.691
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1648
01:20:01.691 --> 01:20:02.524
<v Speaker 3>you only need that once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the truth there isn't to yell at </v>

1649
01:20:05.001 --> 01:20:05.834
<v Speaker 3>your boss.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The truth there is to get your life </v>

1650
01:20:06.771 --> 01:20:07.604
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1651
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:08.813
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1652
01:20:09.700 --> 01:20:10.533
<v Speaker 1>play the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've gotta play the game sometimes </v>

1653
01:20:12.430 --> 01:20:14.830
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get a strategic win to me.</v>

1654
01:20:15.310 --> 01:20:18.070
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and another interesting thing here is,</v>

1655
01:20:18.250 --> 01:20:21.010
<v Speaker 1>as I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to surround yourself with</v>

1656
01:20:21.011 --> 01:20:22.900
<v Speaker 1>yes men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're in a leadership position,</v>

1657
01:20:23.080 --> 01:20:25.810
<v Speaker 1>you also don't want to be your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>personal yes ma'am.</v>

1658
01:20:25.990 --> 01:20:29.360
<v Speaker 1>That he just thinks you're great and </v>
<v Speaker 1>agrees with everything that you're doing</v>

1659
01:20:29.361 --> 01:20:31.630
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and won't tell yourself the hard truth.</v>

1660
01:20:31.631 --> 01:20:32.890
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't lie to yourself.</v>

1661
01:20:33.070 --> 01:20:33.903
<v Speaker 1>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every little one of those things that </v>

1662
01:20:34.811 --> 01:20:35.644
<v Speaker 1>you just listed off are the kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that people does lie to </v>

1663
01:20:38.321 --> 01:20:39.880
<v Speaker 1>themselves and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

1664
01:20:39.881 --> 01:20:42.700
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you don't really need that.</v>

1665
01:20:42.701 --> 01:20:44.380
<v Speaker 1>That person didn't learn anything in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1666
01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:47.020
<v Speaker 1>in that course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why should I go to it?</v>

1667
01:20:47.350 --> 01:20:47.861
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1668
01:20:47.861 --> 01:20:50.770
<v Speaker 1>it's like if you don't tell yourself the</v>
<v Speaker 1>truth about what your,</v>

1669
01:20:50.771 --> 01:20:52.960
<v Speaker 1>what your situation is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be problematic.</v>

1670
01:20:53.170 --> 01:20:54.003
<v Speaker 1>Just like if you don't have people on </v>
<v Speaker 1>your team above you or below you in the </v>

1671
01:20:56.801 --> 01:20:58.240
<v Speaker 1>chain of command that tell you the </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth,</v>

1672
01:20:58.480 --> 01:20:59.313
<v Speaker 1>that's going to be problematic as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is something which is something </v>

1673
01:21:03.281 --> 01:21:04.120
<v Speaker 1>that's easier.</v>

1674
01:21:04.780 --> 01:21:05.613
<v Speaker 3>So the playing the game thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So are you thinking about that as a </v>

1675
01:21:08.171 --> 01:21:11.740
<v Speaker 3>consequence of necessary discipline?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1676
01:21:11.741 --> 01:21:13.380
<v Speaker 3>like cause,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause there,</v>

1677
01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:14.993
<v Speaker 3>because it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems to be you're making two cases </v>

1678
01:21:17.111 --> 01:21:18.130
<v Speaker 3>at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1679
01:21:18.131 --> 01:21:21.370
<v Speaker 3>One is that you should obviously not </v>
<v Speaker 3>undertake unethical actions,</v>

1680
01:21:21.580 --> 01:21:22.413
<v Speaker 3>but then by the same token,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you have to subordinate yourself to </v>

1681
01:21:26.021 --> 01:21:27.550
<v Speaker 3>the realities of the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1682
01:21:27.551 --> 01:21:28.384
<v Speaker 3>and I think that that's psychologically </v>
<v Speaker 3>true because you're always in a </v>

1683
01:21:30.731 --> 01:21:33.490
<v Speaker 3>situation where if you're in an </v>
<v Speaker 3>organization,</v>

1684
01:21:33.700 --> 01:21:34.533
<v Speaker 3>there's kind of an arbitrary and </v>
<v Speaker 3>tyrannical aspect to it because it's </v>

1685
01:21:36.911 --> 01:21:38.890
<v Speaker 3>never working perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

1686
01:21:38.950 --> 01:21:41.290
<v Speaker 3>and then there's the positive aspect to </v>
<v Speaker 3>it too.</v>

1687
01:21:41.500 --> 01:21:45.970
<v Speaker 3>And so whenever you're doing a job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could be that you're,</v>

1688
01:21:46.110 --> 01:21:49.570
<v Speaker 3>you're called upon to do things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1689
01:21:49.571 --> 01:21:50.404
<v Speaker 3>what would you say that there are a </v>
<v Speaker 3>necessary part of the operation of the </v>

1690
01:21:52.871 --> 01:21:53.704
<v Speaker 3>machinery?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess that would be particularly true </v>

1691
01:21:54.761 --> 01:21:55.594
<v Speaker 3>in military.</v>

1692
01:21:55.740 --> 01:21:57.070
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And let me give you these,</v>

1693
01:21:57.100 --> 01:21:58.500
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a broad example,</v>

1694
01:21:58.501 --> 01:21:59.520
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1695
01:21:59.820 --> 01:22:00.653
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my personality and my reputation is </v>

1696
01:22:05.761 --> 01:22:06.470
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1697
01:22:06.470 --> 01:22:07.500
<v Speaker 1>when I was in the military,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1698
01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:08.550
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Jocko.</v>

1699
01:22:08.580 --> 01:22:09.650
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not going to,</v>

1700
01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:10.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

1701
01:22:10.380 --> 01:22:11.213
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone tells him to do something he </v>

1702
01:22:11.851 --> 01:22:13.350
<v Speaker 1>doesn't want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just going to say,</v>

1703
01:22:13.351 --> 01:22:14.640
<v Speaker 1>screw you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not doing it.</v>

1704
01:22:14.641 --> 01:22:16.140
<v Speaker 1>We're doing it my way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1705
01:22:16.230 --> 01:22:17.430
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got the knock.</v>

1706
01:22:17.490 --> 01:22:18.323
<v Speaker 1>But that was kind of the impression </v>
<v Speaker 1>people would get from me if they didn't </v>

1707
01:22:21.001 --> 01:22:22.140
<v Speaker 1>know me from the outside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think,</v>

1708
01:22:22.141 --> 01:22:22.974
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy's a knuckle dragger he's just </v>

1709
01:22:24.031 --> 01:22:25.450
<v Speaker 1>going to go forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

1710
01:22:25.451 --> 01:22:26.284
<v Speaker 1>he's just going to make things happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's not going to listen to anyone </v>

1711
01:22:28.051 --> 01:22:28.884
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the impression from the </v>

1712
01:22:29.941 --> 01:22:32.330
<v Speaker 1>outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reality is a,</v>

1713
01:22:32.331 --> 01:22:34.330
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't do that and,</v>

1714
01:22:34.390 --> 01:22:35.223
<v Speaker 1>and be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reality is w w what my actions I'd </v>

1715
01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:38.491
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1716
01:22:38.491 --> 01:22:39.780
<v Speaker 1>a young lieutenant would come to me and </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

1717
01:22:39.781 --> 01:22:40.171
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1718
01:22:40.171 --> 01:22:42.030
<v Speaker 1>my boss has to tell me to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this and this.</v>

1719
01:22:42.150 --> 01:22:44.190
<v Speaker 1>And what they think I was going to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>is like,</v>

1720
01:22:44.250 --> 01:22:45.690
<v Speaker 1>Bro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't do that.</v>

1721
01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:46.720
<v Speaker 1>Stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You tell him,</v>

1722
01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:48.630
<v Speaker 1>screw you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't make any sense.</v>

1723
01:22:49.140 --> 01:22:51.660
<v Speaker 1>And they'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd get this look in their eyes of,</v>

1724
01:22:51.661 --> 01:22:53.460
<v Speaker 1>of surprise when I'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1725
01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:55.620
<v Speaker 1>your boss wants you to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do it,</v>

1726
01:22:55.980 --> 01:22:57.960
<v Speaker 1>do it well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>play the game.</v>

1727
01:22:57.990 --> 01:22:59.340
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm telling you to do is </v>
<v Speaker 1>play the game.</v>

1728
01:22:59.341 --> 01:23:01.050
<v Speaker 1>Because these things are meaningless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's some,</v>

1729
01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:02.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something is pathetic.</v>

1730
01:23:02.971 --> 01:23:03.481
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1731
01:23:03.481 --> 01:23:05.040
<v Speaker 1>you got to fill out a form a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

1732
01:23:05.110 --> 01:23:05.943
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1733
01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:08.500
<v Speaker 1>shut up and play the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll look even my,</v>

1734
01:23:08.540 --> 01:23:11.020
<v Speaker 1>so is that a matter?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll matter of picking your battles.</v>

1735
01:23:11.290 --> 01:23:12.123
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly is a matter of picking </v>

1736
01:23:13.151 --> 01:23:15.520
<v Speaker 1>your battles and you as cause that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of strategy,</v>

1737
01:23:15.521 --> 01:23:17.470
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything can't be the war.</v>

1738
01:23:17.530 --> 01:23:20.590
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's exactly what it is.</v>

1739
01:23:20.590 --> 01:23:22.450
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good example,</v>

1740
01:23:22.451 --> 01:23:25.870
<v Speaker 1>and we wrote about it in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a dichotomy of leadership,</v>

1741
01:23:25.871 --> 01:23:26.740
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1742
01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:29.200
<v Speaker 1>my friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my guy that worked for me,</v>

1743
01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:30.153
<v Speaker 1>Leif Babin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were getting told to do all this </v>

1744
01:23:31.901 --> 01:23:33.570
<v Speaker 1>paperwork.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta,</v>

1745
01:23:33.580 --> 01:23:35.140
<v Speaker 1>you gotta fill out these forms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to,</v>

1746
01:23:35.141 --> 01:23:37.540
<v Speaker 1>you got to have a serialized inventory </v>
<v Speaker 1>of everything.</v>

1747
01:23:37.541 --> 01:23:38.860
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be signed off this many </v>
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>

1748
01:23:38.861 --> 01:23:39.694
<v Speaker 1>We need to know the qualifications of </v>
<v Speaker 1>each and every person and when their </v>

1749
01:23:42.341 --> 01:23:43.174
<v Speaker 1>qualifications come up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do and all these just ridiculous </v>

1750
01:23:45.611 --> 01:23:49.270
<v Speaker 1>paperwork.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And lafe came to me and with,</v>

1751
01:23:49.271 --> 01:23:50.950
<v Speaker 1>with the other platoon commander guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>named Seth,</v>

1752
01:23:50.951 --> 01:23:52.060
<v Speaker 1>he came to me and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>

1753
01:23:52.061 --> 01:23:54.910
<v Speaker 1>this is bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do we gotta do all this paperwork?</v>

1754
01:23:54.980 --> 01:23:56.770
<v Speaker 1>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're here training for war.</v>

1755
01:23:56.771 --> 01:23:58.720
<v Speaker 1>We're getting ready for war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why we got to do this?</v>

1756
01:23:59.410 --> 01:24:00.243
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>life will tell you his expectation was </v>

1757
01:24:03.011 --> 01:24:04.240
<v Speaker 1>that I was going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right,</v>

1758
01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:06.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go to the commanding </v>
<v Speaker 1>officer and tell him,</v>

1759
01:24:06.341 --> 01:24:06.760
<v Speaker 1>screw this.</v>

1760
01:24:06.760 --> 01:24:08.530
<v Speaker 1>We're not doing this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is crap.</v>

1761
01:24:08.650 --> 01:24:10.060
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to prep because we were in </v>
<v Speaker 1>training,</v>

1762
01:24:10.061 --> 01:24:12.700
<v Speaker 1>getting ready to deploy to Iraq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is crap.</v>

1763
01:24:12.701 --> 01:24:15.250
<v Speaker 1>We're not doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I looked at him and said,</v>

1764
01:24:15.430 --> 01:24:16.263
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're doing all of this paperwork and </v>

1765
01:24:18.191 --> 01:24:19.510
<v Speaker 1>not only are we going to do this </v>
<v Speaker 1>paperwork,</v>

1766
01:24:19.540 --> 01:24:21.310
<v Speaker 1>we're going to do it better than anyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>else,</v>

1767
01:24:21.311 --> 01:24:23.380
<v Speaker 1>and we're going to turn it in before </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's even do.</v>

1768
01:24:24.270 --> 01:24:24.850
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1769
01:24:24.850 --> 01:24:26.830
<v Speaker 1>both him and seth were kind of taken a </v>
<v Speaker 1>back then.</v>

1770
01:24:26.890 --> 01:24:29.890
<v Speaker 1>The fact that I wasn't standing up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

1771
01:24:29.891 --> 01:24:33.760
<v Speaker 1>we're not doing this rap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I explained to me,</v>

1772
01:24:33.761 --> 01:24:34.594
<v Speaker 1>here's what we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're building a relationship with my </v>

1773
01:24:36.851 --> 01:24:37.681
<v Speaker 1>commanding officer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a,</v>

1774
01:24:37.681 --> 01:24:38.514
<v Speaker 1>our commanding officer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to do these little things </v>

1775
01:24:40.361 --> 01:24:41.194
<v Speaker 1>for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to play the game because at </v>

1776
01:24:43.241 --> 01:24:45.100
<v Speaker 1>some 0.2 things are gonna happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>

1777
01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:46.570
<v Speaker 1>we want to build trust with my boss.</v>

1778
01:24:46.630 --> 01:24:48.610
<v Speaker 1>I want my boss to look at me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when he tells me to do,</v>

1779
01:24:48.740 --> 01:24:50.380
<v Speaker 1>to fill out paperwork,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he knows is going to be filled out.</v>

1780
01:24:50.500 --> 01:24:52.750
<v Speaker 1>If he wants me to take down a building,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he knows it's going to get taken out.</v>

1781
01:24:52.751 --> 01:24:53.890
<v Speaker 1>If he wants me to execute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1782
01:24:54.100 --> 01:24:55.990
<v Speaker 1>a larger mission,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll go and get it done.</v>

1783
01:24:56.130 --> 01:24:58.630
<v Speaker 1>We're bill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I can't fill out paperwork correctly,</v>

1784
01:24:58.990 --> 01:24:59.823
<v Speaker 1>how can he trust me to go on an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a real operation and have guys lives </v>

1785
01:25:03.101 --> 01:25:05.680
<v Speaker 1>at risk?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea is like,</v>

1786
01:25:05.710 --> 01:25:07.270
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're gunna play the game.</v>

1787
01:25:07.300 --> 01:25:10.780
<v Speaker 1>And I think sometimes people start to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hear me,</v>

1788
01:25:10.781 --> 01:25:11.614
<v Speaker 1>they start to listen to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And their first instinct is Jocko </v>

1789
01:25:14.681 --> 01:25:18.550
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't put up with them shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why these,</v>

1790
01:25:18.700 --> 01:25:19.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll hit me up the same thing.</v>

1791
01:25:19.991 --> 01:25:22.210
<v Speaker 1>They'll write me an email,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll write me a letter and say,</v>

1792
01:25:22.211 --> 01:25:23.650
<v Speaker 1>here's the situation I'm in.</v>

1793
01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:25.390
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a boss,</v>

1794
01:25:25.391 --> 01:25:26.280
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a military,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1795
01:25:26.281 --> 01:25:28.480
<v Speaker 1>it's any of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's their wife,</v>

1796
01:25:28.710 --> 01:25:31.990
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like my wife expects me not to train.</v>

1797
01:25:31.991 --> 01:25:35.350
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu is something as stupid as that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like my wife won't let me train.</v>

1798
01:25:35.351 --> 01:25:37.630
<v Speaker 1>It's driving me crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really starting to bother me.</v>

1799
01:25:38.190 --> 01:25:39.250
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why won't you?</v>

1800
01:25:39.430 --> 01:25:40.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the problem?</v>

1801
01:25:40.510 --> 01:25:42.310
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you taken her out for dinner?</v>

1802
01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:43.353
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like play the damn game a little bit so </v>

1803
01:25:45.761 --> 01:25:46.594
<v Speaker 1>that you can win strategic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's the same thing I think with </v>

1804
01:25:49.181 --> 01:25:50.890
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the 12 rules where you're like,</v>

1805
01:25:50.891 --> 01:25:52.630
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell the truth or at least don't lie.</v>

1806
01:25:52.810 --> 01:25:53.643
<v Speaker 1>It's like I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there is a dichotomy in that </v>

1807
01:25:56.201 --> 01:25:59.710
<v Speaker 1>statement and that is if you run around </v>
<v Speaker 1>telling the absolute truth,</v>

1808
01:25:59.711 --> 01:26:00.544
<v Speaker 1>everyone is going to be like that Jim </v>
<v Speaker 1>Carey movie where he can't say anything </v>

1809
01:26:03.110 --> 01:26:04.340
<v Speaker 1>that's not a hundred percent true.</v>

1810
01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:05.180
<v Speaker 1>And he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1811
01:26:05.270 --> 01:26:07.850
<v Speaker 1>a woman says good morning and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look fat.</v>

1812
01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:10.130
<v Speaker 1>You know what it's like one of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>like [inaudible] not good.</v>

1813
01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:12.830
<v Speaker 1>And so you got to learn to play the </v>
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>

1814
01:26:12.870 --> 01:26:14.780
<v Speaker 1>And I guess again going back to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>

1815
01:26:14.781 --> 01:26:19.781
<v Speaker 1>it's like that's a tough call to make in</v>
<v Speaker 1>these situations.</v>

1816
01:26:19.850 --> 01:26:20.683
<v Speaker 1>How much do you play the game?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's an ethical line that you </v>

1817
01:26:22.821 --> 01:26:24.950
<v Speaker 1>could cross at some point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I become a Cappo,</v>

1818
01:26:25.910 --> 01:26:29.450
<v Speaker 1>hey you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you played the game and you went too far</v>

1819
01:26:29.451 --> 01:26:32.330
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And just like in a leadership situation,</v>

1820
01:26:33.170 --> 01:26:34.003
<v Speaker 1>if I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're my boss and I'm just kissing </v>

1821
01:26:35.061 --> 01:26:38.180
<v Speaker 1>your ass and do one of my guys lose </v>
<v Speaker 1>respect for me,</v>

1822
01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:40.580
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my team will lose respect from me if you</v>

1823
01:26:40.581 --> 01:26:42.200
<v Speaker 1>tell me to do something completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid.</v>

1824
01:26:42.290 --> 01:26:42.981
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey guys,</v>

1825
01:26:42.981 --> 01:26:43.580
<v Speaker 1>that's what the boss says.</v>

1826
01:26:43.580 --> 01:26:44.413
<v Speaker 1>We're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My guys will lose respect for me and I </v>

1827
01:26:46.161 --> 01:26:46.994
<v Speaker 1>won't be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't be able to execute missions the </v>

1828
01:26:49.851 --> 01:26:52.670
<v Speaker 1>way I should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If when the pushback is proper,</v>

1829
01:26:52.790 --> 01:26:53.623
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1830
01:26:54.020 --> 01:26:55.460
<v Speaker 1>Hey Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't make any sense.</v>

1831
01:26:55.461 --> 01:26:58.010
<v Speaker 1>We shouldn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I go to the guys and say,</v>

1832
01:26:58.011 --> 01:26:59.150
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told,</v>

1833
01:26:59.151 --> 01:27:00.620
<v Speaker 1>I talked to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to see what he says,</v>

1834
01:27:00.621 --> 01:27:03.110
<v Speaker 1>but trust me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we have to do this,</v>

1835
01:27:03.111 --> 01:27:05.120
<v Speaker 1>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll figure out a way to make it work.</v>

1836
01:27:05.270 --> 01:27:07.730
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're just the guy that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>totally on board.</v>

1837
01:27:07.731 --> 01:27:10.460
<v Speaker 1>If you're a brown noser right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your P,</v>

1838
01:27:10.490 --> 01:27:13.040
<v Speaker 1>your guys will lose respect for you 100%</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will,</v>

1839
01:27:13.041 --> 01:27:13.874
<v Speaker 1>they'll lose respect for you if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't play the game at all and you'd </v>

1840
01:27:16.510 --> 01:27:19.460
<v Speaker 1>push back on everything that your boss </v>
<v Speaker 1>says you're going to,</v>

1841
01:27:19.461 --> 01:27:20.690
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to get fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1842
01:27:20.691 --> 01:27:22.010
<v Speaker 1>That's another ethical situation.</v>

1843
01:27:22.010 --> 01:27:22.843
<v Speaker 1>Like if my boss and my boss and you told</v>
<v Speaker 1>me to do something that's I don't </v>

1844
01:27:25.401 --> 01:27:30.380
<v Speaker 1>believe in or it's like a bad plan and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>may I draw the line in the sand and say,</v>

1845
01:27:30.410 --> 01:27:31.820
<v Speaker 1>screw you Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not doing it.</v>

1846
01:27:31.821 --> 01:27:32.870
<v Speaker 1>You can fire me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

1847
01:27:32.871 --> 01:27:33.351
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

1848
01:27:33.351 --> 01:27:35.840
<v Speaker 1>You fire me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get some yes man to come in.</v>

1849
01:27:35.900 --> 01:27:38.690
<v Speaker 1>He takes my guys out on the mission and </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets them all killed.</v>

1850
01:27:39.050 --> 01:27:42.590
<v Speaker 1>He didn't mitigate the risk properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's better for me ethically to say,</v>

1851
01:27:43.220 --> 01:27:44.053
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1852
01:27:44.150 --> 01:27:46.220
<v Speaker 1>Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree with this plan.</v>

1853
01:27:46.250 --> 01:27:47.840
<v Speaker 1>I really wish we could do it another </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

1854
01:27:48.020 --> 01:27:49.550
<v Speaker 1>Is there any way I could flex on it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>

1855
01:27:49.551 --> 01:27:50.510
<v Speaker 1>nope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing it this way.</v>

1856
01:27:50.630 --> 01:27:53.210
<v Speaker 1>It is better for me in many situations </v>
<v Speaker 1>to say,</v>

1857
01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:54.410
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got it.</v>

1858
01:27:55.220 --> 01:27:58.250
<v Speaker 1>I'll make an indication of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>complexity of the truth.</v>

1859
01:27:58.251 --> 01:27:59.084
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the rules of thumb that I think </v>

1860
01:28:01.161 --> 01:28:04.100
<v Speaker 1>is worth abiding by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I guess this is something that makes</v>

1861
01:28:04.101 --> 01:28:09.101
<v Speaker 1>me somewhat conservative in some ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you should do what everyone else</v>

1862
01:28:09.921 --> 01:28:12.260
<v Speaker 1>does unless there's a very good reason </v>
<v Speaker 1>not to.</v>

1863
01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:15.920
<v Speaker 1>And then I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the same idea that you're</v>

1864
01:28:15.921 --> 01:28:18.920
<v Speaker 1>putting forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that if you,</v>

1865
01:28:18.921 --> 01:28:19.754
<v Speaker 1>if you do fight back against everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're just a rebel without a </v>

1866
01:28:22.191 --> 01:28:23.024
<v Speaker 1>cause,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1867
01:28:23.060 --> 01:28:26.180
<v Speaker 1>And you discredit yourself entirely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you accept everything,</v>

1868
01:28:26.181 --> 01:28:27.014
<v Speaker 1>well then you're not even there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's some judicious analysis </v>

1869
01:28:30.321 --> 01:28:31.154
<v Speaker 1>of the situation that helps you </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand when the time for action is </v>

1870
01:28:33.861 --> 01:28:34.694
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And most of the time what you're doing </v>

1871
01:28:37.611 --> 01:28:40.400
<v Speaker 1>in life is you're doing what other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people do.</v>

1872
01:28:40.401 --> 01:28:43.790
<v Speaker 1>And that's going along with the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's part of being socialized.</v>

1873
01:28:43.791 --> 01:28:47.240
<v Speaker 1>But there's going to be times when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right thing to do is to break a rule and</v>

1874
01:28:47.241 --> 01:28:49.310
<v Speaker 1>to do it very carefully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1875
01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:52.730
<v Speaker 1>and if there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

1876
01:28:52.731 --> 01:28:53.990
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a scene,</v>

1877
01:28:54.350 --> 01:28:55.183
<v Speaker 1>I think this is a new testament scene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it might be in some of the </v>

1878
01:28:57.441 --> 01:28:58.330
<v Speaker 1>Apocryphal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1879
01:28:58.460 --> 01:29:00.140
<v Speaker 1>Apocryphal writings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>

1880
01:29:00.410 --> 01:29:01.980
<v Speaker 1>So Christ is walking down the road</v>

1881
01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:04.810
<v Speaker 3>on the Sabbath and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1882
01:29:05.310 --> 01:29:07.560
<v Speaker 3>there's a ditch by the road and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>very hot.</v>

1883
01:29:07.950 --> 01:29:10.710
<v Speaker 3>And in the ditch there's a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in the whole there's a sheep.</v>

1884
01:29:11.220 --> 01:29:12.053
<v Speaker 3>And so the sheep is stuck in the hole </v>
<v Speaker 3>and this guy shepherd is trying to get </v>

1885
01:29:15.091 --> 01:29:17.670
<v Speaker 3>the sheep out of the hole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Christ walks by and he says,</v>

1886
01:29:18.420 --> 01:29:20.820
<v Speaker 3>if you don't understand what you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing,</v>

1887
01:29:20.821 --> 01:29:23.220
<v Speaker 3>you're a transgressor of the law and </v>
<v Speaker 3>your curse.</v>

1888
01:29:23.221 --> 01:29:25.110
<v Speaker 3>But if you do understand what you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing,</v>

1889
01:29:25.290 --> 01:29:27.470
<v Speaker 3>then you're blessed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

1890
01:29:27.471 --> 01:29:29.190
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a perfect example of that.</v>

1891
01:29:29.191 --> 01:29:30.024
<v Speaker 3>A,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's,</v>

1892
01:29:30.070 --> 01:29:32.820
<v Speaker 3>it's like if you're okay now here's your</v>
<v Speaker 3>situation.</v>

1893
01:29:32.821 --> 01:29:35.040
<v Speaker 3>You're a shepherd and you're supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be taken care of that sheep,</v>

1894
01:29:35.130 --> 01:29:36.900
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's the Sabbath Day,</v>

1895
01:29:36.901 --> 01:29:38.820
<v Speaker 3>so you're not supposed to be work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1896
01:29:38.821 --> 01:29:42.990
<v Speaker 3>if you have decided you've thought this </v>
<v Speaker 3>through,</v>

1897
01:29:42.991 --> 01:29:43.824
<v Speaker 3>you think it's the Sabbath Day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is something that everybody needs </v>

1898
01:29:46.081 --> 01:29:47.880
<v Speaker 3>because everybody needs to take a rest.</v>

1899
01:29:48.150 --> 01:29:48.983
<v Speaker 3>And this is a rule I shouldn't break </v>
<v Speaker 3>because everybody needs to take a rest </v>

1900
01:29:51.690 --> 01:29:53.280
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or things degenerate.</v>

1901
01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:56.850
<v Speaker 3>And I understand that and I have a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of respect for it,</v>

1902
01:29:57.180 --> 01:30:01.800
<v Speaker 3>but I think that in this situation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's still morally appropriate for me to</v>

1903
01:30:01.801 --> 01:30:02.634
<v Speaker 3>break that rule in this slight way and </v>
<v Speaker 3>get this poor sheep out of this hole </v>

1904
01:30:05.370 --> 01:30:06.740
<v Speaker 3>then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1905
01:30:06.741 --> 01:30:07.574
<v Speaker 3>Christ's judgment was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well then you're exactly on the right </v>

1906
01:30:09.661 --> 01:30:10.494
<v Speaker 3>track.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you're doing it carelessly and </v>

1907
01:30:11.281 --> 01:30:13.200
<v Speaker 3>stupidly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're breaking that rule,</v>

1908
01:30:13.380 --> 01:30:16.140
<v Speaker 3>then we are a transgressor of the law </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're cursed.</v>

1909
01:30:16.141 --> 01:30:19.020
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's exactly at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>essence of what you're describing.</v>

1910
01:30:19.021 --> 01:30:23.880
<v Speaker 3>It's like you play by the rules,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then there's a matter of rule,</v>

1911
01:30:23.881 --> 01:30:25.770
<v Speaker 3>which is now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you break the rules.</v>

1912
01:30:25.771 --> 01:30:26.604
<v Speaker 3>And you do that very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very carefully because when you break </v>

1913
01:30:28.141 --> 01:30:30.450
<v Speaker 3>the rules,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're breaking the rules.</v>

1914
01:30:30.600 --> 01:30:34.260
<v Speaker 3>And the rules are what keep peace they </v>
<v Speaker 3>and what keep peace in order.</v>

1915
01:30:34.620 --> 01:30:38.340
<v Speaker 3>And so you break them only in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>service of a higher piece in order.</v>

1916
01:30:38.700 --> 01:30:40.770
<v Speaker 3>And so that seems to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think that's,</v>

1917
01:30:40.920 --> 01:30:41.753
<v Speaker 3>you see this in in well this sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 3>stories that are influencing even the </v>

1918
01:30:45.631 --> 01:30:47.850
<v Speaker 3>things that you're writing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like in the Harry Potter series,</v>

1919
01:30:47.851 --> 01:30:49.740
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Harry's,</v>

1920
01:30:49.980 --> 01:30:50.813
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>friends and compatriots are quite </v>

1921
01:30:53.310 --> 01:30:54.310
<v Speaker 3>disciplined.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Her mind,</v>

1922
01:30:54.311 --> 01:30:55.144
<v Speaker 3>he in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause she's an absolute master of her </v>

1923
01:30:56.761 --> 01:30:57.594
<v Speaker 3>craft,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they still break rules when it's </v>

1924
01:30:59.191 --> 01:31:01.140
<v Speaker 3>necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>only when it's necessary.</v>

1925
01:31:01.141 --> 01:31:01.974
<v Speaker 3>And that's what makes them more than the</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who are just breaking rules all </v>

1926
01:31:06.331 --> 01:31:07.440
<v Speaker 3>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the villains,</v>

1927
01:31:07.441 --> 01:31:10.260
<v Speaker 3>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and also makes them more than the people</v>

1928
01:31:10.261 --> 01:31:14.100
<v Speaker 3>that are just being good by being </v>
<v Speaker 3>conformist.</v>

1929
01:31:14.370 --> 01:31:17.820
<v Speaker 3>So you need that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that touch of rebelliousness,</v>

1930
01:31:17.821 --> 01:31:20.490
<v Speaker 3>but it's gotta be a flavoring and not </v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole diet.</v>

1931
01:31:20.770 --> 01:31:21.603
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've actually talked about that on this </v>

1932
01:31:22.961 --> 01:31:27.961
<v Speaker 1>podcast before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's people in the military that they</v>

1933
01:31:28.361 --> 01:31:29.194
<v Speaker 1>are like met are rule followers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are people that have been </v>

1934
01:31:32.531 --> 01:31:33.364
<v Speaker 1>following rules their whole lives and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've got perfect grades and they </v>

1935
01:31:36.281 --> 01:31:36.970
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the team came,</v>

1936
01:31:36.970 --> 01:31:39.240
<v Speaker 1>they were all of these things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

1937
01:31:39.241 --> 01:31:41.710
<v Speaker 1>they're going to make really good solid </v>
<v Speaker 1>leaders.</v>

1938
01:31:41.711 --> 01:31:42.544
<v Speaker 1>Like they're going to be great leaders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then there's this like one group </v>

1939
01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:46.833
<v Speaker 1>above them have that same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they also have that little bit of </v>

1940
01:31:50.801 --> 01:31:52.240
<v Speaker 1>rebellion that they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

1941
01:31:52.241 --> 01:31:55.270
<v Speaker 1>we're not doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

1942
01:31:55.690 --> 01:31:57.340
<v Speaker 1>And that is really a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1943
01:31:57.610 --> 01:31:59.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an important factor to have.</v>

1944
01:31:59.860 --> 01:32:00.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1945
01:32:00.430 --> 01:32:01.400
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the reasons I would,</v>

1946
01:32:01.420 --> 01:32:02.590
<v Speaker 3>this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Colonel David Hackworth,</v>

1947
01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:03.633
<v Speaker 3>this guy was the ultimate rule follower </v>
<v Speaker 3>for his whole career at the end in </v>

1948
01:32:08.891 --> 01:32:11.350
<v Speaker 3>Vietnam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did an interview and said,</v>

1949
01:32:11.351 --> 01:32:13.990
<v Speaker 3>if we keep fighting this way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not going to win this war.</v>

1950
01:32:14.470 --> 01:32:17.590
<v Speaker 3>And they drove him out of the army.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's,</v>

1951
01:32:17.830 --> 01:32:19.570
<v Speaker 3>that's the thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause all along the way,</v>

1952
01:32:19.571 --> 01:32:21.250
<v Speaker 3>there was other times where he do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1953
01:32:21.251 --> 01:32:23.480
<v Speaker 3>his guys weren't getting taken care of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'd break a rule and bring them be,</v>

1954
01:32:23.481 --> 01:32:24.101
<v Speaker 3>or he'd do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1955
01:32:24.101 --> 01:32:25.600
<v Speaker 3>he didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he do that along the way.</v>

1956
01:32:25.601 --> 01:32:26.434
<v Speaker 3>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not so far outside the bonds that it </v>

1957
01:32:28.331 --> 01:32:30.760
<v Speaker 3>would jeopardize his career because if </v>
<v Speaker 3>he would do that,</v>

1958
01:32:30.761 --> 01:32:32.230
<v Speaker 3>then you're not in charge of these guys </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

1959
01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:35.890
<v Speaker 3>Now you're not going to have any impact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's not get fired.</v>

1960
01:32:36.140 --> 01:32:38.920
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's get stupidly fired.</v>

1961
01:32:39.490 --> 01:32:41.740
<v Speaker 3>That's not an improvement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1962
01:32:42.220 --> 01:32:44.920
<v Speaker 3>Well that's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>awesome.</v>

1963
01:32:45.240 --> 01:32:46.750
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess we,</v>

1964
01:32:46.751 --> 01:32:47.584
<v Speaker 3>I know you've got to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I can't think that we could get to a </v>

1965
01:32:50.441 --> 01:32:55.180
<v Speaker 3>better little crust of the a or little </v>
<v Speaker 3>capstone of the conversation then.</v>

1966
01:32:55.181 --> 01:32:56.240
<v Speaker 3>Right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1967
01:32:56.770 --> 01:32:57.970
<v Speaker 3>thanks for coming on again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1968
01:32:57.971 --> 01:32:58.804
<v Speaker 3>my pleasure man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm glad we got a chance to talk </v>

1969
01:33:00.431 --> 01:33:01.264
<v Speaker 3>about this book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a book that everybody should </v>

1970
01:33:02.411 --> 01:33:04.080
<v Speaker 3>read and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you,</v>

1971
01:33:04.250 --> 01:33:06.070
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ordered the,</v>

1972
01:33:06.100 --> 01:33:08.560
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ordered a copy of yours with the Ford.</v>

1973
01:33:08.700 --> 01:33:09.610
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>From Europe.</v>

1974
01:33:10.090 --> 01:33:12.940
<v Speaker 3>You can't buy it from Amazon here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to buy it from Amazon,</v>

1975
01:33:12.941 --> 01:33:14.230
<v Speaker 3>so it'll be here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When will it be?</v>

1976
01:33:14.240 --> 01:33:15.073
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're still negotiating the rights </v>

1977
01:33:16.331 --> 01:33:19.570
<v Speaker 3>because the rights holders differ in </v>
<v Speaker 3>North America and so that's the issue at</v>

1978
01:33:19.571 --> 01:33:20.201
<v Speaker 3>the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1979
01:33:20.201 --> 01:33:22.540
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I worked with an English publisher,</v>

1980
01:33:22.541 --> 01:33:25.240
<v Speaker 3>Penguin in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the UK that put out the,</v>

1981
01:33:25.480 --> 01:33:27.730
<v Speaker 3>I think it's vantage books,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I remember correctly.</v>

1982
01:33:27.970 --> 01:33:30.370
<v Speaker 3>I should just check and make sure that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly right.</v>

1983
01:33:31.330 --> 01:33:34.660
<v Speaker 3>Harper perennial modern classics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not,</v>

1984
01:33:34.661 --> 01:33:35.494
<v Speaker 3>that's not the British won the British.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The British one hasn't gotten to my </v>

1985
01:33:39.311 --> 01:33:41.080
<v Speaker 3>house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1986
01:33:41.140 --> 01:33:43.540
<v Speaker 3>it has to be ordered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has to be ordered through Amazon UK.</v>

1987
01:33:43.541 --> 01:33:44.374
<v Speaker 3>And we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're working on a couple of things </v>

1988
01:33:45.731 --> 01:33:50.260
<v Speaker 3>maybe to also maybe get the audio rights</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the abridged version because I'd like</v>

1989
01:33:50.261 --> 01:33:51.580
<v Speaker 3>to read it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nice.</v>

1990
01:33:51.610 --> 01:33:53.710
<v Speaker 3>And that would be good so that people </v>
<v Speaker 3>could listen to it.</v>

1991
01:33:53.711 --> 01:33:56.450
<v Speaker 3>And so because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an absolutely necessary book.</v>

1992
01:33:56.470 --> 01:33:57.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's written actually.</v>

1993
01:33:58.350 --> 01:34:00.790
<v Speaker 3>I like it cause it's written very </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation.</v>

1994
01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's cracking jokes in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's making,</v>

1995
01:34:03.700 --> 01:34:05.860
<v Speaker 3>it's a brilliant piece of literature as </v>
<v Speaker 3>well as,</v>

1996
01:34:06.030 --> 01:34:07.690
<v Speaker 3>I mean it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a very readable book,</v>

1997
01:34:07.691 --> 01:34:12.100
<v Speaker 3>although it's unbelievably harsh and </v>
<v Speaker 3>demanding and draining to read,</v>

1998
01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:14.050
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's brilliantly written.</v>

1999
01:34:14.051 --> 01:34:19.051
<v Speaker 3>It's an unbelievably engrossing read and</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the most horrible possible way.</v>

2000
01:34:20.170 --> 01:34:20.761
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2001
01:34:20.761 --> 01:34:24.100
<v Speaker 3>and it is the case that it's written at </v>
<v Speaker 3>this white hot pace.</v>

2002
01:34:24.101 --> 01:34:24.934
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like talking to someone who's </v>

2003
01:34:26.260 --> 01:34:28.960
<v Speaker 3>righteously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not self righteously angry,</v>

2004
01:34:29.020 --> 01:34:32.020
<v Speaker 3>but righteously angry for fur ball,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

2005
01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:33.970
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for dozens of hours.</v>

2006
01:34:33.971 --> 01:34:36.940
<v Speaker 3>And he just can't believe the levels of </v>
<v Speaker 3>outrage that are,</v>

2007
01:34:37.210 --> 01:34:38.043
<v Speaker 3>that are being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are being so incredibly well </v>

2008
01:34:43.361 --> 01:34:45.760
<v Speaker 3>expressed and so effectively expressed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2009
01:34:45.820 --> 01:34:46.631
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>

2010
01:34:46.631 --> 01:34:47.464
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's also worth emphasizing the </v>

2011
01:34:49.751 --> 01:34:50.980
<v Speaker 3>fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2012
01:34:50.981 --> 01:34:51.814
<v Speaker 3>Solzhenitsyn's real contribution in many</v>
<v Speaker 3>ways was to lay the catastrophe at the </v>

2013
01:34:56.201 --> 01:34:58.730
<v Speaker 3>feet of the doctrine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And not to say no,</v>

2014
01:34:58.731 --> 01:34:59.564
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this wasn't an aberration because of </v>

2015
01:35:00.951 --> 01:35:01.784
<v Speaker 3>Stella North in Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lennon being the great leader and then </v>

2016
01:35:03.951 --> 01:35:07.370
<v Speaker 3>Stella and being the monster because </v>
<v Speaker 3>Lennon was plenty monster himself.</v>

2017
01:35:07.730 --> 01:35:08.563
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Stellan was the logical conclusion </v>

2018
01:35:10.221 --> 01:35:12.140
<v Speaker 3>to len and not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not an aberration,</v>

2019
01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:13.273
<v Speaker 3>but to say that no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the horrors of what happened in the </v>

2020
01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:16.993
<v Speaker 3>Soviet Union were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were implicit in the collectivists </v>

2021
01:35:19.581 --> 01:35:23.810
<v Speaker 3>system utopian system that gave rise to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the philosophy to begin with.</v>

2022
01:35:23.810 --> 01:35:24.643
<v Speaker 3>And that that's also an explanation why </v>
<v Speaker 3>the same catastrophes occurred wherever </v>

2023
01:35:27.891 --> 01:35:32.000
<v Speaker 3>the Soviet system was applied everywhere</v>
<v Speaker 3>else in the world at something we really</v>

2024
01:35:32.001 --> 01:35:32.834
<v Speaker 3>need to know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we fought a whole cold war over </v>

2025
01:35:34.221 --> 01:35:35.054
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We put damn near put the world to the </v>

2026
01:35:36.111 --> 01:35:36.944
<v Speaker 3>torch because of this and the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 3>these ideas are the fact that these </v>

2027
01:35:41.091 --> 01:35:43.340
<v Speaker 3>ideas are creeping back is really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2028
01:35:43.430 --> 01:35:44.263
<v Speaker 3>it's unbearable as far as I'm concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we'll hopefully people reading this </v>

2029
01:35:48.861 --> 01:35:49.694
<v Speaker 3>book and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rerelease of this book with your </v>

2030
01:35:51.921 --> 01:35:54.080
<v Speaker 3>forward will prevent that from </v>
<v Speaker 3>happening.</v>

2031
01:35:54.500 --> 01:35:55.333
<v Speaker 3>At least it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hopefully it will be a drop in a bucket </v>

2032
01:35:58.371 --> 01:36:01.220
<v Speaker 3>that many other people can put drops </v>
<v Speaker 3>into as well.</v>

2033
01:36:01.550 --> 01:36:02.383
<v Speaker 3>And so I'm hoping,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think the book has sold 15,000 </v>

2034
01:36:05.001 --> 01:36:08.450
<v Speaker 3>copies since the beginning of November,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is pretty good for the reissue.</v>

2035
01:36:08.460 --> 01:36:10.340
<v Speaker 3>An old classic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like it,</v>

2036
01:36:10.500 --> 01:36:11.333
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's required reading for an informed </v>

2037
01:36:13.731 --> 01:36:16.520
<v Speaker 3>citizen of the 21st century.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not optional.</v>

2038
01:36:16.580 --> 01:36:19.520
<v Speaker 3>You need to know this material.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not,</v>

2039
01:36:19.970 --> 01:36:20.803
<v Speaker 3>you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't understand your position in </v>

2040
01:36:23.151 --> 01:36:27.230
<v Speaker 3>society as an individual or a citizen </v>
<v Speaker 3>without knowing this material.</v>

2041
01:36:27.590 --> 01:36:30.380
<v Speaker 3>So it's like not knowing about what </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened in Nazi Germany.</v>

2042
01:36:30.440 --> 01:36:35.150
<v Speaker 3>It's not acceptable to not know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So read the book.</v>

2043
01:36:35.450 --> 01:36:37.580
<v Speaker 3>Thanks for coming George.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really good to see you again man.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Jordan Peterson has departed the </v>

2047
01:36:46.570 --> 01:36:47.403
<v Speaker 4>recording studio and if you noticed that</v>
<v Speaker 4>Echo Charles was not present during the </v>

2048
01:36:54.521 --> 01:36:55.354
<v Speaker 4>recording with Jordan Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but through the miracle of technology </v>

2049
01:37:00.670 --> 01:37:01.503
<v Speaker 4>and recording,</v>
<v Speaker 4>echo has now joined us for the support </v>

<v Speaker 4>So if people listen to this podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which we appreciate and you want to </v>

<v Speaker 4>support this podcast and support </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself.</v>

2054
01:37:21.950 --> 01:37:24.670
<v Speaker 4>So there are ways to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Echo can fill you in.</v>

2055
01:37:25.150 --> 01:37:25.983
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So first way is when you're doing </v>

2056
01:37:29.321 --> 01:37:31.450
<v Speaker 4>jujitsu cause we're all doing Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

2057
01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:36.540
<v Speaker 4>it might sound a little bit repetitive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but to me when you do this,</v>

2058
01:37:36.541 --> 01:37:37.780
<v Speaker 4>you going to be doing it every single </v>
<v Speaker 4>day,</v>

2059
01:37:38.650 --> 01:37:39.483
<v Speaker 4>every single week at least.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even if you're doing the two times a </v>

2060
01:37:41.711 --> 01:37:42.910
<v Speaker 4>week,</v>
<v Speaker 4>three to get it.</v>

2061
01:37:43.480 --> 01:37:45.310
<v Speaker 4>Either way you're going to need a g and </v>

<v Speaker 4>You ever make hot?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

2179
01:42:31.990 --> 01:42:35.380
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I'm a fan that you can put in water,</v>

2180
01:42:35.440 --> 01:42:36.520
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you put it in?</v>

2181
01:42:36.521 --> 01:42:39.100
<v Speaker 4>Water and milk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is not hot cocoa to me.</v>

2182
01:42:39.130 --> 01:42:40.390
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know what you're talking about.</v>

2183
01:42:40.420 --> 01:42:41.253
<v Speaker 4>You get the little,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the little packet that you're supposed </v>

2184
01:42:42.641 --> 01:42:43.474
<v Speaker 4>to mix with water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's got the little crappy marshmallows </v>

2185
01:42:44.561 --> 01:42:45.011
<v Speaker 4>in it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2186
01:42:45.011 --> 01:42:46.390
<v Speaker 4>that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a nonstarter for me.</v>

2187
01:42:46.440 --> 01:42:47.960
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's kind of the point there.</v>

2188
01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:51.280
<v Speaker 4>They're sort of along the same lines </v>
<v Speaker 4>where it's like cool,</v>

2189
01:42:51.281 --> 01:42:54.040
<v Speaker 4>do it and it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can do it.</v>

2190
01:42:54.070 --> 01:42:54.700
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2191
01:42:54.700 --> 01:42:56.230
<v Speaker 4>and there's probably many,</v>
<v Speaker 4>many,</v>

2192
01:42:56.650 --> 01:42:59.290
<v Speaker 4>many people who do that and I'm not mad </v>
<v Speaker 4>at them.</v>

2193
01:42:59.830 --> 01:43:02.360
<v Speaker 4>But you put the milk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that stuff and you know,</v>

2194
01:43:02.380 --> 01:43:04.070
<v Speaker 4>that's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's my opinion.</v>

2195
01:43:04.420 --> 01:43:08.140
<v Speaker 4>You can't have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't have hot chocolate milk.</v>

2196
01:43:09.970 --> 01:43:12.250
<v Speaker 4>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's right up there.</v>

2197
01:43:12.450 --> 01:43:13.283
<v Speaker 4>She don't worry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your kid won the surrogate mint </v>

2198
01:43:14.921 --> 01:43:16.120
<v Speaker 4>chocolate peanut butter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>chocolate,</v>

2199
01:43:16.121 --> 01:43:21.121
<v Speaker 4>vanilla gorilla and the darkness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then there's the warrior kid mark,</v>

2200
01:43:21.191 --> 01:43:22.024
<v Speaker 4>which has a little bit less protein in </v>
<v Speaker 4>it unless you double up on your scoops </v>

2201
01:43:25.090 --> 01:43:25.923
<v Speaker 4>like I do for the strawberry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause it's a strawberry is ridiculously </v>

2202
01:43:28.991 --> 01:43:30.610
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So give that a shot.</v>

2203
01:43:30.611 --> 01:43:31.444
<v Speaker 4>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all these things are </v>

<v Speaker 4>there's no double blind placebo tested.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well you know,</v>

2293
01:47:30.260 --> 01:47:31.810
<v Speaker 4>single blind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe that's,</v>

2294
01:47:32.020 --> 01:47:32.853
<v Speaker 4>you know what that means,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's not official and it is </v>

2295
01:47:35.161 --> 01:47:37.470
<v Speaker 4>official when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

2296
01:47:37.650 --> 01:47:41.760
<v Speaker 4>And I kind of tried to psychologically </v>
<v Speaker 4>analyze psychological warfare.</v>

2297
01:47:41.790 --> 01:47:44.130
<v Speaker 4>Like why does it work every single time?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he was part of it.</v>

2298
01:47:44.520 --> 01:47:45.353
<v Speaker 4>Even you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know how like when you get </v>

2299
01:47:46.531 --> 01:47:48.150
<v Speaker 4>hypnotized,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying you should have,</v>

2300
01:47:48.151 --> 01:47:48.984
<v Speaker 4>I should have asked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I should have asked Jordan this </v>

2301
01:47:49.771 --> 01:47:51.100
<v Speaker 4>question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2302
01:47:51.110 --> 01:47:52.710
<v Speaker 4>And he did agree with this I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

2303
01:47:52.880 --> 01:47:55.380
<v Speaker 4>well let's hear it goes bro Theory.</v>

2304
01:47:57.810 --> 01:48:01.680
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I'm being hypnotized for example.</v>

2305
01:48:02.910 --> 01:48:04.290
<v Speaker 4>I've never been hypnotized.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2306
01:48:04.291 --> 01:48:05.730
<v Speaker 4>me neither.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So well,</v>

2307
01:48:05.760 --> 01:48:09.140
<v Speaker 4>but then again it happens to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so have you ever said volunteered?</v>

2308
01:48:09.141 --> 01:48:10.530
<v Speaker 4>Did he admit okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>me neither.</v>

2309
01:48:10.531 --> 01:48:12.540
<v Speaker 4>Same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So hypnotism,</v>

2310
01:48:12.541 --> 01:48:15.150
<v Speaker 4>from what I understand is you have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>like be,</v>

2311
01:48:15.240 --> 01:48:18.030
<v Speaker 4>what do you call like successful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>open to it.</v>

2312
01:48:18.480 --> 01:48:19.380
<v Speaker 4>Open to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2313
01:48:19.620 --> 01:48:20.453
<v Speaker 4>So if you're suggestible person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's like you have a certain kind of </v>

2314
01:48:24.121 --> 01:48:25.440
<v Speaker 4>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then on top of that,</v>

2315
01:48:25.470 --> 01:48:28.740
<v Speaker 4>even more consciously,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to volunteer to be hypnotized.</v>

2316
01:48:29.040 --> 01:48:30.030
<v Speaker 4>A guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2317
01:48:30.031 --> 01:48:30.864
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure there's methods that you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of hypnotize someone without them </v>

2318
01:48:33.331 --> 01:48:35.190
<v Speaker 4>knowing it or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But usually,</v>

2319
01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:38.960
<v Speaker 4>I shouldn't even say I'm sure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

2320
01:48:40.160 --> 01:48:40.690
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's right.</v>

2321
01:48:40.690 --> 01:48:44.760
<v Speaker 4>So if you can hit a dead zone and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>or not,</v>

2322
01:48:44.790 --> 01:48:49.080
<v Speaker 4>nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 4>usually the hypnotic sequence goes from,</v>

2323
01:48:49.081 --> 01:48:51.270
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you volunteer like conscious of,</v>

2324
01:48:51.271 --> 01:48:51.690
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

2325
01:48:51.690 --> 01:48:52.523
<v Speaker 4>I'll be hypnotizing you sit there and </v>
<v Speaker 4>your suit coat to 10 and you're closing </v>

2326
01:48:55.021 --> 01:48:55.854
<v Speaker 4>your eyes and breathing anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you consciously volunteer to be </v>

2327
01:48:59.401 --> 01:49:00.234
<v Speaker 4>hypnotized,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you're open to being hypnotized and </v>

2328
01:49:01.981 --> 01:49:02.401
<v Speaker 4>then blah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>

2329
01:49:02.401 --> 01:49:04.140
<v Speaker 4>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So psychologic warfare.</v>

2330
01:49:04.230 --> 01:49:04.861
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

2331
01:49:04.861 --> 01:49:05.910
<v Speaker 4>you recognize,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2332
01:49:05.911 --> 01:49:06.744
<v Speaker 4>I have this weakness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm about to skip this workout right </v>

2333
01:49:07.891 --> 01:49:09.450
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're basically saying,</v>

2334
01:49:09.451 --> 01:49:10.201
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need to help.</v>

2335
01:49:10.201 --> 01:49:11.940
<v Speaker 4>I need you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need a little spa.</v>

2336
01:49:11.970 --> 01:49:13.500
<v Speaker 4>Volunteering for help.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Volunteering.</v>

2337
01:49:13.501 --> 01:49:14.334
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not like I'm like sitting in my </v>

2338
01:49:15.691 --> 01:49:17.400
<v Speaker 4>room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not completely against your will.</v>

2339
01:49:17.820 --> 01:49:18.600
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2340
01:49:18.600 --> 01:49:22.050
<v Speaker 4>You're not just busting in the door,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know insane.</v>

2341
01:49:22.051 --> 01:49:23.220
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't skip the workout.</v>

2342
01:49:23.250 --> 01:49:24.090
<v Speaker 4>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in your mind,</v>

2343
01:49:24.091 --> 01:49:26.910
<v Speaker 4>you already committed to keeping,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way it's different is you're like,</v>

2344
01:49:27.150 --> 01:49:28.770
<v Speaker 4>you're not committed to skipping the </v>
<v Speaker 4>workout.</v>

2345
01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:33.180
<v Speaker 4>You just like are running the risk of </v>
<v Speaker 4>skipping the work.</v>

2346
01:49:33.560 --> 01:49:35.940
<v Speaker 4>You know that weakness just creeps in </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're like,</v>

2347
01:49:35.941 --> 01:49:36.774
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see you weakness you're creeping in </v>

2348
01:49:37.501 --> 01:49:37.800
<v Speaker 4>right now.</v>

2349
01:49:37.800 --> 01:49:38.970
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm basically,</v>

2350
01:49:38.971 --> 01:49:42.630
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to tell Jocko that you're in </v>
<v Speaker 4>here and he's going to,</v>

2351
01:49:42.631 --> 01:49:43.464
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>make you leave and you played the track </v>

2352
01:49:45.391 --> 01:49:46.470
<v Speaker 4>or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have it on your phone,</v>

2353
01:49:46.740 --> 01:49:47.573
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You had,</v>

2354
01:49:47.950 --> 01:49:50.680
<v Speaker 4>you have all your playlist on your phone</v>
<v Speaker 4>anyway.</v>

2355
01:49:50.681 --> 01:49:53.200
<v Speaker 4>You just play the psychological warfare </v>
<v Speaker 4>one and boom,</v>

2356
01:49:53.230 --> 01:49:54.760
<v Speaker 4>you won't skip the workout.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See what I'm saying?</v>

2357
01:49:54.820 --> 01:49:56.440
<v Speaker 4>Cause you don't want to skip the </v>
<v Speaker 4>workout.</v>

2358
01:49:56.590 --> 01:50:00.070
<v Speaker 4>No one wants to skip to work on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one's thinking tomorrow.</v>

2359
01:50:00.071 --> 01:50:02.770
<v Speaker 4>I can't wait to skip this workout.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that just not like that.</v>

2360
01:50:02.771 --> 01:50:04.340
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's,</v>

2361
01:50:04.470 --> 01:50:07.060
<v Speaker 4>you come in and you just give that </v>
<v Speaker 4>little nudge.</v>

2362
01:50:07.120 --> 01:50:09.040
<v Speaker 4>That's why it works so good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's true.</v>

2363
01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:10.840
<v Speaker 4>It's absolutely true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like it.</v>

2364
01:50:11.320 --> 01:50:14.080
<v Speaker 4>And then the less psychological warfare,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very effective.</v>

2365
01:50:14.090 --> 01:50:14.923
<v Speaker 4>Hundred percent also while you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>working out and if you're bored with </v>

2366
01:50:18.611 --> 01:50:23.611
<v Speaker 4>your squats bench,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get some kettlebells from on it,</v>

2367
01:50:27.430 --> 01:50:29.080
<v Speaker 4>in my opinion on it.</v>

2368
01:50:29.080 --> 01:50:32.140
<v Speaker 4>Dot Com slash Jocko good stuff on their </v>
<v Speaker 4>jump rope.</v>

2369
01:50:32.141 --> 01:50:34.210
<v Speaker 4>Battle ropes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kettlebells,</v>

2370
01:50:34.530 --> 01:50:35.450
<v Speaker 4>clubs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mic.</v>

2371
01:50:35.460 --> 01:50:36.293
<v Speaker 4>Be careful of the clubs because I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>watching a video of a guy doing this </v>

2372
01:50:40.211 --> 01:50:43.380
<v Speaker 4>club routine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like Dang it,</v>

2373
01:50:43.450 --> 01:50:45.220
<v Speaker 4>eat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It took a lot of coordination.</v>

2374
01:50:45.221 --> 01:50:48.850
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm looking at it and he had like </v>
<v Speaker 4>the 40 I think like a big one.</v>

2375
01:50:48.851 --> 01:50:49.684
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't even imagine trying to do </v>

2376
01:50:50.410 --> 01:50:51.243
<v Speaker 4>anything coordinated with the 40 yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause I only have the 20 yeah and yeah </v>

2377
01:50:57.180 --> 01:51:01.090
<v Speaker 4>and they come off real a lot more heavy </v>
<v Speaker 4>than they look like when you grab them.</v>

2378
01:51:01.120 --> 01:51:02.850
<v Speaker 4>I mean at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if it's 20 pounds,</v>

2379
01:51:02.860 --> 01:51:04.000
<v Speaker 4>20 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2380
01:51:04.330 --> 01:51:08.530
<v Speaker 4>there's no getting past that physically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when you pick it up it's like,</v>

2381
01:51:09.160 --> 01:51:12.010
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know when you pick up your friend or</v>

2382
01:51:12.011 --> 01:51:15.190
<v Speaker 4>your kid freaking and they weighed 70 </v>
<v Speaker 4>pounds.</v>

2383
01:51:15.370 --> 01:51:17.890
<v Speaker 4>It's like I pick up 70 pounds with one </v>
<v Speaker 4>hand.</v>

2384
01:51:18.160 --> 01:51:18.993
<v Speaker 4>It's no problem when it's a dumbbell </v>
<v Speaker 4>should pick up your kid when they're 70 </v>

2385
01:51:21.911 --> 01:51:23.770
<v Speaker 4>pieces of one hand can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hard.</v>

2386
01:51:24.530 --> 01:51:26.080
<v Speaker 4>Unless that's how these clubs are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anyway.</v>

2387
01:51:26.081 --> 01:51:27.220
<v Speaker 4>So watch out for those.</v>

01:52:32.230 --> 01:52:32.981
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's fun.</v>

2411
01:52:32.981 --> 01:52:34.750
<v Speaker 4>We put on the TV when I was in Hawaii,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2412
01:52:34.751 --> 01:52:37.610
<v Speaker 4>you have the smart tv in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can put youtube on there and you put</v>

2413
01:52:37.611 --> 01:52:38.444
<v Speaker 4>it on there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I put on the TV and my kids are all </v>

2414
01:52:39.341 --> 01:52:41.170
<v Speaker 4>jumping up and down like in the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I have is,</v>

2415
01:52:41.171 --> 01:52:42.100
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's two minutes long.</v>

2416
01:52:42.101 --> 01:52:43.470
<v Speaker 4>So No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2417
01:52:43.910 --> 01:52:44.680
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2418
01:52:44.680 --> 01:52:45.950
<v Speaker 4>Jordan I were talking about it</v>

2419
01:52:46.280 --> 01:52:50.510
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously it's about facing your dragons</v>

2420
01:52:50.570 --> 01:52:52.660
<v Speaker 1>and there's obviously a metaphor there </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a,</v>

2421
01:52:52.950 --> 01:52:56.630
<v Speaker 1>there's real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>true pragmatic,</v>

2422
01:52:56.750 --> 01:52:57.583
<v Speaker 1>simple to understand lessons of how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stand up and confront the world and </v>

2423
01:53:01.521 --> 01:53:02.354
<v Speaker 1>confront your fears that little kids </v>
<v Speaker 1>will clearly and easily understand and </v>

2424
01:53:06.560 --> 01:53:08.060
<v Speaker 1>it'll leave an impact on anybody that </v>
<v Speaker 1>reads it.</v>

2425
01:53:08.270 --> 01:53:09.103
<v Speaker 1>So Mike and the dragons that you can get</v>
<v Speaker 1>that book on top of that if you've got </v>

2426
01:53:12.180 --> 01:53:13.013
<v Speaker 1>kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can also get them though the way of </v>

2427
01:53:13.881 --> 01:53:14.714
<v Speaker 1>the warrior kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is another book about a young kid </v>

2428
01:53:18.171 --> 01:53:21.740
<v Speaker 1>who's going through the problems that </v>
<v Speaker 1>normal kids have.</v>

2429
01:53:21.950 --> 01:53:25.910
<v Speaker 1>And luckily his uncle Jake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was a seal in the seal teams,</v>

2430
01:53:25.911 --> 01:53:28.680
<v Speaker 1>it shows up for the summer and helps him</v>
<v Speaker 1>overcome those problems.</v>

2431
01:53:28.681 --> 01:53:32.540
<v Speaker 1>And then that series carries on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And another book called Mark's mission.</v>

2432
01:53:33.020 --> 01:53:36.670
<v Speaker 1>You can pick those two books up and give</v>
<v Speaker 1>them to whatever kids you,</v>

2433
01:53:36.690 --> 01:53:37.610
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those books.</v>

2434
01:53:37.610 --> 01:53:38.443
<v Speaker 1>When you read those books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll wish you had that book when you </v>

2435
01:53:40.731 --> 01:53:41.720
<v Speaker 1>were a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

2436
01:53:41.721 --> 01:53:42.554
<v Speaker 1>I absolutely wish I had that book when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a kid and I wish I had that book </v>

2437
01:53:45.471 --> 01:53:47.430
<v Speaker 1>when my kids were kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2438
01:53:48.440 --> 01:53:50.840
<v Speaker 1>because it teaches them what it is they </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to know.</v>

2439
01:53:50.900 --> 01:53:52.130
<v Speaker 1>Period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

2440
01:53:52.970 --> 01:53:53.803
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the discipline equals freedom field </v>

2441
01:53:54.591 --> 01:53:56.510
<v Speaker 1>manual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That book,</v>

2442
01:53:57.230 --> 01:53:58.850
<v Speaker 1>that's how you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how you,</v>

2443
01:53:59.300 --> 01:54:01.820
<v Speaker 1>it's just a field manual of how to be on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the path of discipline.</v>

2444
01:54:01.880 --> 01:54:02.713
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at the path of discipline is not </v>

2445
01:54:04.131 --> 01:54:07.220
<v Speaker 1>easy and there's no field manual for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh wait,</v>

2446
01:54:07.280 --> 01:54:10.040
<v Speaker 1>there is now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there didn't use to be there.</v>

2447
01:54:10.041 --> 01:54:10.731
<v Speaker 1>Didn't used to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

2448
01:54:10.731 --> 01:54:12.740
<v Speaker 1>I know discipline will help me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do I get disciplined?</v>

2449
01:54:12.920 --> 01:54:15.500
<v Speaker 1>Where does discipline come from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's none of that.</v>

2450
01:54:15.530 --> 01:54:19.640
<v Speaker 1>Information was assembled anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made a field manual for it.</v>

2451
01:54:19.700 --> 01:54:21.440
<v Speaker 1>It's called the discipline equals </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom field manual.</v>

2452
01:54:22.010 --> 01:54:23.960
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2453
01:54:23.961 --> 01:54:27.620
<v Speaker 1>it's not like any other book you've ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>seen or read,</v>

2454
01:54:27.710 --> 01:54:29.390
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

2455
01:54:29.810 --> 01:54:32.710
<v Speaker 1>but it's very popular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's great if you want it.</v>

2500
01:57:26.701 --> 01:57:30.570
<v Speaker 1>refer back to and that is that evil does</v>
