00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:06.833
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes there's a glitch in the matrix</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the limitations of the old </v>

2
00:00:10.381 --> 00:00:14.190
<v Speaker 1>operating system and laid bare and </v>
<v Speaker 1>something new pokes through.</v>

3
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:16.553
<v Speaker 1>There's been dozens of responses to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jordan Peterson Channel Four interview </v>

4
00:00:19.261 --> 00:00:21.630
<v Speaker 1>already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What makes this one different?</v>

5
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.050
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a pretty unique perspective.</v>

6
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.790
<v Speaker 1>In October last year I went to Toronto </v>
<v Speaker 1>to interview Jordan Peterson,</v>

7
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.880
<v Speaker 1>this home from where I came in from </v>
<v Speaker 1>London last night.</v>

8
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.283
<v Speaker 1>I turned the interview into the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>full length documentary about Jordan </v>

9
00:00:40.291 --> 00:00:44.250
<v Speaker 1>Peterson's ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was pretty sure he'd soon become a lot</v>

10
00:00:44.251 --> 00:00:48.690
<v Speaker 1>more famous and be recognized as one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most significant public thinkers,</v>

11
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.850
<v Speaker 1>but I couldn't possibly have predicted </v>
<v Speaker 1>how he breakthrough to a mass audience.</v>

12
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.900
<v Speaker 1>A few weeks later Peter's and did an </v>
<v Speaker 1>interview with journalists,</v>

13
00:00:57.901 --> 00:01:00.510
<v Speaker 1>Kathy Newman on channel four news in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>UK,</v>

14
00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.700
<v Speaker 1>a program I worked on as reporter and </v>
<v Speaker 1>producer for 10 years.</v>

15
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.920
<v Speaker 1>It was a sensation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Millions watched it online,</v>

16
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.780
<v Speaker 1>tens of thousands commented and </v>
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming majority felt.</v>

17
00:01:15.781 --> 00:01:20.781
<v Speaker 1>Peterson had been unfairly represented</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in the week since it hasn't stopped,</v>

18
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:25.523
<v Speaker 1>Peterson has been asked about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly on the most high profile </v>

19
00:01:28.441 --> 00:01:32.690
<v Speaker 1>online shows 12 rules for life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So without reading this.</v>

20
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.093
<v Speaker 1>So what you're saying is sort of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's only 12 things you need to know </v>

21
00:01:38.151 --> 00:01:38.781
<v Speaker 1>in like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

22
00:01:38.781 --> 00:01:39.710
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

23
00:01:39.711 --> 00:01:40.880
<v Speaker 1>Well yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

24
00:01:40.881 --> 00:01:41.714
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this interview that you just did with </v>

25
00:01:43.461 --> 00:01:47.690
<v Speaker 1>this woman kathy new mission was that in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the UK it was channel four UK.</v>

26
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.923
<v Speaker 1>So what does this glitch say about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>state of mainstream media and the </v>

27
00:01:53.341 --> 00:01:54.360
<v Speaker 1>culture at large?</v>

28
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.233
<v Speaker 2>My diagnosis of what's actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening is that people are moving </v>

29
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.513
<v Speaker 2>further and further away from what is </v>
<v Speaker 2>what thinking actually is at more and </v>

30
00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:08.690
<v Speaker 2>more into merely running a script.</v>

31
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.190
<v Speaker 1>And what does Jordan Peterson actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>think?</v>

32
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:13.453
<v Speaker 1>It's so controversial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are misrepresented more than anyone </v>

33
00:02:17.171 --> 00:02:18.050
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

34
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.240
<v Speaker 1>weird way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are villainized in a weird way where</v>

35
00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.103
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe that these people are </v>

36
00:02:24.551 --> 00:02:29.551
<v Speaker 1>honestly looking at your opinions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming up with these conclusions.</v>

37
00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:31.293
<v Speaker 1>I believe this encounter struck such a </v>
<v Speaker 1>nerve because it's a cultural watershed </v>

38
00:02:34.811 --> 00:02:38.170
<v Speaker 1>moment scene properly as Peterson would </v>
<v Speaker 1>say.</v>

39
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.610
<v Speaker 1>It's archetypal in that it contains </v>
<v Speaker 1>layers and layers of meaning</v>

40
00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.123
<v Speaker 1>that go right to the heart of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>biggest rift we're seeing play out in </v>

41
00:02:48.161 --> 00:02:48.994
<v Speaker 1>the culture over the next 50 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do my best to unpack it </v>

42
00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.960
<v Speaker 1>from the clash between new and old </v>
<v Speaker 1>media.</v>

43
00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.740
<v Speaker 1>There's also why Youtube is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>kill tv because</v>

44
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.600
<v Speaker 3>television,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by its nature,</v>

45
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.920
<v Speaker 3>all of these narrow broadcast </v>
<v Speaker 3>technologies,</v>

46
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.800
<v Speaker 3>they re they rely on forcing the story</v>

47
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.000
<v Speaker 1>all the way down to the mythological an </v>
<v Speaker 1>archetype or level.</v>

48
00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.980
<v Speaker 4>I thought of videology says fragmentary </v>
<v Speaker 4>mythologies.</v>

49
00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.843
<v Speaker 4>That's where they get their archetype </v>
<v Speaker 4>will in psychological power in the </v>

50
00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:20.263
<v Speaker 4>postmodern world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this seems to be something that's </v>

51
00:03:22.011 --> 00:03:25.100
<v Speaker 4>increasingly seeping out into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>culture at large.</v>

52
00:03:25.101 --> 00:03:27.350
<v Speaker 4>You have nothing but the tyrannical </v>
<v Speaker 4>father.</v>

53
00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:28.363
<v Speaker 4>Nothing but the destructive force of </v>
<v Speaker 4>masculine consciousness and nothing but </v>

54
00:03:32.301 --> 00:03:34.910
<v Speaker 4>the benevolent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>benevolent great mother.</v>

55
00:03:34.911 --> 00:03:35.744
<v Speaker 4>And it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's an appalling ideology and it seems </v>

56
00:03:37.821 --> 00:03:41.870
<v Speaker 4>to me that it's sucking the vitality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is exactly what you'd expect.</v>

57
00:03:41.871 --> 00:03:44.570
<v Speaker 4>Symbolically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's sucking the vitality of our culture</v>

58
00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:45.553
<v Speaker 1>until off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do we move forward constructively </v>

59
00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.030
<v Speaker 1>rather than just adding to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>polarization.</v>

60
00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:55.570
<v Speaker 1>I've been a journalist for 16 years in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the newsroom of the BBC and channel four</v>

61
00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.980
<v Speaker 1>and then making documentaries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I moved away from the front line of news</v>

62
00:04:00.981 --> 00:04:03.770
<v Speaker 1>sometime ago and started learning </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology,</v>

63
00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.780
<v Speaker 1>which is what first drew me to Jordan </v>
<v Speaker 1>Peterson from a distance.</v>

64
00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.973
<v Speaker 1>I've started to see the blind spots of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the establishment media much more </v>

65
00:04:12.651 --> 00:04:13.484
<v Speaker 1>clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spent some of the best years of my </v>

66
00:04:15.621 --> 00:04:16.454
<v Speaker 1>working life at channel four news and </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a huge amount of respect and </v>

67
00:04:19.341 --> 00:04:20.174
<v Speaker 1>gratitude to the program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm making this film because I feel </v>

68
00:04:23.721 --> 00:04:24.554
<v Speaker 1>so strongly that if we can't have open </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversations about the kind of topics </v>

69
00:04:27.531 --> 00:04:30.410
<v Speaker 1>Peterson is raising,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're in serious trouble.</v>

70
00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.850
<v Speaker 5>My book went up to number two and on </v>
<v Speaker 5>amazon.com in the u s the next day,</v>

71
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.200
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's number one in Canada.</v>

72
00:04:37.201 --> 00:04:39.330
<v Speaker 5>It's number three in the UK.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All on Amazon.</v>

73
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.360
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't have asked for more </v>
<v Speaker 5>publicity.</v>

74
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:43.463
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so I could also be sitting back and </v>

75
00:04:45.181 --> 00:04:45.691
<v Speaker 5>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

76
00:04:45.691 --> 00:04:46.524
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she tried to my a person who regarded </v>

77
00:04:49.561 --> 00:04:50.394
<v Speaker 5>herself as my ideological opponent tried</v>
<v Speaker 5>to go after my philosophy and my </v>

78
00:04:54.121 --> 00:04:54.954
<v Speaker 5>reputation on national TV failed </v>
<v Speaker 5>brutally and has been taken apart for </v>

79
00:05:00.211 --> 00:05:01.860
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like this is a good day,</v>

80
00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:05.400
<v Speaker 5>but I don't regard it as a good day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it's a good day.</v>

81
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.960
<v Speaker 5>I think that it's evidence of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>instability of the times that we're in.</v>

82
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:14.213
<v Speaker 5>It would have been much better for me </v>
<v Speaker 5>and for everyone else if what we would </v>

83
00:05:18.191 --> 00:05:19.024
<v Speaker 5>have had was a real conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You said that it's actually a sign of </v>

84
00:05:22.321 --> 00:05:25.770
<v Speaker 5>the times where things could go really </v>
<v Speaker 5>wrong for all of us really soon.</v>

85
00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:26.761
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're,</v>

86
00:05:26.761 --> 00:05:28.770
<v Speaker 5>we're playing with fire and what do you </v>
<v Speaker 5>mean by this?</v>

87
00:05:28.771 --> 00:05:30.000
<v Speaker 5>Can you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>can you elaborate?</v>

88
00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:32.243
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>things go wrong and cultures all the </v>

89
00:05:33.121 --> 00:05:33.954
<v Speaker 5>time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

90
00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.860
<v Speaker 5>You get,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get the polarization increases until</v>

91
00:05:37.861 --> 00:05:39.300
<v Speaker 5>people start to act it out.</v>

92
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:42.473
<v Speaker 1>Peterson is one of the new breed of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinkers made famous almost completely </v>

93
00:05:45.481 --> 00:05:46.314
<v Speaker 1>by the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the broadcast media arts of a </v>

94
00:05:49.291 --> 00:05:54.291
<v Speaker 1>powerful new informal network being </v>
<v Speaker 1>called the intellectual dark web and the</v>

95
00:05:54.691 --> 00:05:58.100
<v Speaker 1>mainstream media is based on an old </v>
<v Speaker 1>model that</v>

96
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:03.100
<v Speaker 6>is being replaced by new media and new </v>
<v Speaker 6>technology so quickly that it's false or</v>

97
00:06:03.531 --> 00:06:06.260
<v Speaker 6>becoming glaringly obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fortunately,</v>

98
00:06:06.261 --> 00:06:10.550
<v Speaker 6>thanks to Youtube podcasting and however</v>
<v Speaker 6>else you get shows like this one,</v>

99
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.790
<v Speaker 6>the mainstream media stranglehold on </v>
<v Speaker 6>information,</v>

100
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:14.653
<v Speaker 6>which really is a stranglehold on your </v>
<v Speaker 6>ability to think clearly about the </v>

101
00:06:17.721 --> 00:06:21.050
<v Speaker 6>issues of the day is crumbling at an </v>
<v Speaker 6>incredible rate.</v>

102
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:24.860
<v Speaker 6>Now the question is who and what will </v>
<v Speaker 6>replace it?</v>

103
00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.113
<v Speaker 6>A few months ago,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one of my favorite people to sit across </v>

104
00:06:27.321 --> 00:06:31.460
<v Speaker 6>this table from Eric Weinstein came up </v>
<v Speaker 6>with the phrase intellectual dark web to</v>

105
00:06:31.461 --> 00:06:35.150
<v Speaker 6>describe this eclectic mix of people </v>
<v Speaker 6>from Sam Harris to Ben Shapiro,</v>

106
00:06:35.151 --> 00:06:37.880
<v Speaker 6>to his brother,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Bret Weinstein to Jordan Peterson,</v>

107
00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:38.803
<v Speaker 6>all of whom are figuring out ways to </v>
<v Speaker 6>have the important and often dangerous </v>

108
00:06:41.871 --> 00:06:45.140
<v Speaker 6>conversations that are completely </v>
<v Speaker 6>ignored by the mainstream.</v>

109
00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:46.213
<v Speaker 6>It's why I would argue that this </v>
<v Speaker 6>collection of people are actually more </v>

110
00:06:48.261 --> 00:06:51.830
<v Speaker 6>influential at this point than whatever </v>
<v Speaker 6>collection of cable news pundits you can</v>

111
00:06:51.831 --> 00:06:52.664
<v Speaker 6>come up with.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you think I'm being hyperbolic about </v>

112
00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:55.664
<v Speaker 6>the growing influence of this group,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just check the traction that these </v>

113
00:06:57.891 --> 00:07:01.940
<v Speaker 6>people get on twitter or facebook </v>
<v Speaker 6>compared to our mainstream competitors.</v>

114
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.030
<v Speaker 6>Twitter may not be real life as I say in</v>
<v Speaker 6>my twitter bio,</v>

115
00:07:05.031 --> 00:07:08.630
<v Speaker 6>but it is some barometer of what the </v>
<v Speaker 6>Zeitgeists is right now.</v>

116
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:09.793
<v Speaker 1>What unites this group of thinkers is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense that the set of ideas that have </v>

117
00:07:13.251 --> 00:07:14.084
<v Speaker 1>run western culture for years are </v>
<v Speaker 1>breaking down and that the chaos of the </v>

118
00:07:18.261 --> 00:07:23.261
<v Speaker 1>moment is the attempt to find new ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's nearly all happening online.</v>

119
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:28.310
<v Speaker 4>Part of the problem that we have right </v>
<v Speaker 4>now in our culture is trying to diagnose</v>

120
00:07:28.311 --> 00:07:29.144
<v Speaker 4>the level at which the discussion should</v>
<v Speaker 4>be taking place and I think the reason </v>

121
00:07:31.851 --> 00:07:32.684
<v Speaker 4>that this is a tumultuous time is </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it actually is a time for </v>

122
00:07:35.541 --> 00:07:40.130
<v Speaker 4>discussion of first principles and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's that first principles are virtually</v>

123
00:07:40.131 --> 00:07:41.720
<v Speaker 4>at the level of theology,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

124
00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:46.220
<v Speaker 4>Because first principles are the things </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you assume and then move forward.</v>

125
00:07:46.221 --> 00:07:46.641
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

126
00:07:46.641 --> 00:07:49.610
<v Speaker 4>what should we assume while the dignity </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the human soul?</v>

127
00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:50.683
<v Speaker 4>But start with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't treat yourself properly </v>

128
00:07:52.281 --> 00:07:55.160
<v Speaker 4>without assuming that you can't have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>relationship with another person.</v>

129
00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:58.670
<v Speaker 4>You can't stabilize your family.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't have a functional society.</v>

130
00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:01.610
<v Speaker 4>So what does it mean for this human soul</v>
<v Speaker 4>to have dignity?</v>

131
00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:02.683
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the part of the idea is that you're </v>

132
00:08:04.221 --> 00:08:05.054
<v Speaker 4>participating in creation itself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you do that with your actions in </v>

133
00:08:07.761 --> 00:08:08.594
<v Speaker 4>your language,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you get to decide whether you're </v>

134
00:08:09.861 --> 00:08:13.580
<v Speaker 4>tilting the world a bit more towards </v>
<v Speaker 4>heaven or a bit more towards hell.</v>

135
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:14.503
<v Speaker 4>And that's actually what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's a place where the literal in </v>

136
00:08:17.611 --> 00:08:20.600
<v Speaker 4>the metaphorical truth come together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And people are very,</v>

137
00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:22.183
<v Speaker 4>they're terrified of that idea as they </v>
<v Speaker 4>should be because it's a massive </v>

138
00:08:24.861 --> 00:08:25.940
<v Speaker 4>responsibility.</v>

139
00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:31.340
<v Speaker 1>They also argue that the central problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>is polarization boosted by social media.</v>

140
00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:36.870
<v Speaker 1>Peterson's work looks at how people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>hardwired to see the world differently.</v>

141
00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:42.370
<v Speaker 7>A lot of what determines your political </v>
<v Speaker 7>orientation is biological temperament,</v>

142
00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.670
<v Speaker 7>far more than people realize.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So for example,</v>

143
00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:52.720
<v Speaker 7>left leaning people liberals let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>although that's kind of Miss Misnomer,</v>

144
00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:54.613
<v Speaker 7>but we'll keep with the terminology.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Liberals are high in a trait called </v>

145
00:08:58.201 --> 00:09:00.390
<v Speaker 7>openness,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is one of the big five personality</v>

146
00:09:00.391 --> 00:09:01.224
<v Speaker 7>traits and it's associated with interest</v>
<v Speaker 7>in abstraction and interest in </v>

147
00:09:04.531 --> 00:09:05.364
<v Speaker 7>aesthetics.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's the best predictor of liberal </v>

148
00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:11.580
<v Speaker 7>political leaning and they're low in </v>
<v Speaker 7>trait conscientiousness,</v>

149
00:09:11.581 --> 00:09:15.300
<v Speaker 7>which is due to fullness and and </v>
<v Speaker 7>orderliness in particular.</v>

150
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:17.400
<v Speaker 7>Whereas the conservatives are the </v>
<v Speaker 7>opposite.</v>

151
00:09:17.401 --> 00:09:18.234
<v Speaker 7>They're high in conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 7>their due to in orderly and they're low </v>

152
00:09:20.551 --> 00:09:24.570
<v Speaker 7>in openness and that makes them really </v>
<v Speaker 7>good managers and administrators,</v>

153
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:25.463
<v Speaker 7>administrators and often businessmen,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but not very good entrepreneurs because </v>

154
00:09:28.771 --> 00:09:31.590
<v Speaker 7>the entrepreneurs are almost all drawn </v>
<v Speaker 7>from the liberal types.</v>

155
00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:32.903
<v Speaker 7>And so these are really fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 7>fundamentally biologically predicated </v>

156
00:09:37.231 --> 00:09:38.064
<v Speaker 7>differences.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And there you might think about them as </v>

157
00:09:40.051 --> 00:09:44.430
<v Speaker 7>different sets of,</v>
<v Speaker 7>of opportunities and limitations and and</v>

158
00:09:44.431 --> 00:09:45.264
<v Speaker 7>certainly different ways of screening </v>
<v Speaker 7>the world and each of those different </v>

159
00:09:49.351 --> 00:09:50.880
<v Speaker 7>temperamental types needs.</v>

160
00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.790
<v Speaker 7>The other type,</v>
<v Speaker 7>let's call this a diversity issue.</v>

161
00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:55.103
<v Speaker 7>If you start understanding that the </v>
<v Speaker 7>person that you're talking to who </v>

162
00:09:57.421 --> 00:10:02.421
<v Speaker 7>doesn't share your political views isn't</v>
<v Speaker 7>stupid,</v>

163
00:10:02.851 --> 00:10:05.190
<v Speaker 7>that's the first thing necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They might be,</v>

164
00:10:05.191 --> 00:10:06.810
<v Speaker 7>but so might you be,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no.</v>

165
00:10:06.811 --> 00:10:07.644
<v Speaker 7>Stupidity isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The differences in intelligence are not </v>

166
00:10:10.711 --> 00:10:13.260
<v Speaker 7>the prime determinant of differences in </v>
<v Speaker 7>political belief.</v>

167
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:17.040
<v Speaker 7>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so you might be talking to someone who's</v>

168
00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:20.070
<v Speaker 7>more conscientious and less creative </v>
<v Speaker 7>than you if you're,</v>

169
00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:23.550
<v Speaker 7>if you happen to be a liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but that doesn't mean that that person's</v>

170
00:10:23.551 --> 00:10:24.384
<v Speaker 7>perspective is not valid and it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 7>mean that they wouldn't outperform you </v>

171
00:10:27.631 --> 00:10:28.464
<v Speaker 7>in some domains because they would.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So one thing to remember is people </v>

172
00:10:32.431 --> 00:10:35.730
<v Speaker 7>actually do see the world differently.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's not merely that they,</v>

173
00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:39.690
<v Speaker 7>that they're possessively of of ill,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he informed opinions.</v>

174
00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:41.453
<v Speaker 7>The whole point of the deal of a </v>
<v Speaker 7>democracy is to continue the dialogue </v>

175
00:10:44.701 --> 00:10:45.534
<v Speaker 7>between people of different </v>
<v Speaker 7>temperamental types so that we don't </v>

176
00:10:48.151 --> 00:10:48.984
<v Speaker 7>move so far to the right that everything</v>
<v Speaker 7>becomes encapsulated and stone and </v>

177
00:10:53.371 --> 00:10:54.204
<v Speaker 7>doesn't move or so far to the left that </v>
<v Speaker 7>everything dissolves in a kind of a </v>

178
00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:01.770
<v Speaker 7>mealy mouth chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And the only way that you can,</v>

179
00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:06.600
<v Speaker 7>you can navigate between those two </v>
<v Speaker 7>scholls is by is through discussion,</v>

180
00:11:06.601 --> 00:11:09.330
<v Speaker 7>which is why free speech is such an </v>
<v Speaker 7>important value.</v>

181
00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:10.493
<v Speaker 7>It's the thing that keeps the </v>
<v Speaker 7>temperamental types from being at each </v>

182
00:11:12.481 --> 00:11:13.320
<v Speaker 7>other's throats.</v>

183
00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:17.450
<v Speaker 8>In the aftermath of the trump election,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that came as such a shock to most of the</v>

184
00:11:17.451 --> 00:11:18.284
<v Speaker 8>media.</v>
<v Speaker 8>One of the most widely shared analysis </v>

185
00:11:20.241 --> 00:11:21.074
<v Speaker 8>pieces was from deep code.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It describes how the establishment </v>

186
00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:28.223
<v Speaker 8>mainstream media perspective based </v>
<v Speaker 8>around liberal values of openness and </v>

187
00:11:32.221 --> 00:11:33.054
<v Speaker 8>inclusivity he calls the blue church is </v>
<v Speaker 8>being challenged by a new web based </v>

188
00:11:37.831 --> 00:11:38.664
<v Speaker 8>insurgency,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a red religion based on the values of </v>

189
00:11:41.971 --> 00:11:42.804
<v Speaker 8>tribalism.</v>

190
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:44.503
<v Speaker 7>The Culture Wars of the 20th century was</v>
<v Speaker 7>a decisive success for blue and a </v>

191
00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:53.950
<v Speaker 7>effectively a route for</v>

192
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:54.873
<v Speaker 2>red.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what we see first is that red was </v>

193
00:11:58.421 --> 00:12:01.870
<v Speaker 2>forced to move into a deeply exploratory</v>
<v Speaker 2>phase.</v>

194
00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:08.590
<v Speaker 2>Second that it did this in a context </v>
<v Speaker 2>where as it turns out,</v>

195
00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:11.800
<v Speaker 2>things were changing meaningfully,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite significantly.</v>

196
00:12:11.801 --> 00:12:13.090
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it from my perspective,</v>

197
00:12:13.091 --> 00:12:13.924
<v Speaker 2>they in a world historical level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the emergence of entirely new forms of </v>

198
00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:22.450
<v Speaker 2>communication and therefore entirely new</v>
<v Speaker 2>forms of sense making and coherence.</v>

199
00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:24.173
<v Speaker 8>He concludes that the blue church is in </v>
<v Speaker 8>the process of collapse as its dominant </v>

200
00:12:28.471 --> 00:12:31.260
<v Speaker 8>ideology can't adapt to changing </v>
<v Speaker 8>reality,</v>

201
00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:37.220
<v Speaker 8>but that a combination of the two sets </v>
<v Speaker 8>of values of blue and red is essential.</v>

202
00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:41.160
<v Speaker 2>We are conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

203
00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:45.720
<v Speaker 2>and effective in the world in groups not</v>
<v Speaker 2>as individuals.</v>

204
00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:46.853
<v Speaker 2>And the ingredients of those groups</v>
<v Speaker 2>include aspects that are currently </v>

205
00:12:51.821 --> 00:12:54.260
<v Speaker 2>showing up as both red and blue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

206
00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:56.093
<v Speaker 2>I propose somewhat strongly that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>either red nor blue is pure elements </v>

207
00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:08.850
<v Speaker 2>contain the ingredients necessary to </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually be adaptive to reality.</v>

208
00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:11.070
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a disaster.</v>

209
00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:12.670
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

210
00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:17.690
<v Speaker 2>it's a little bit like mmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Separating the hand in the eye.</v>

211
00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:18.891
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're the,</v>

212
00:13:18.891 --> 00:13:21.080
<v Speaker 2>I can see if the eye takes itself as </v>
<v Speaker 2>being,</v>

213
00:13:21.081 --> 00:13:21.914
<v Speaker 2>the essence of virtue is separates </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself from the ability to do the same </v>

214
00:13:24.411 --> 00:13:26.870
<v Speaker 2>thing with the hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For most of human history,</v>

215
00:13:26.871 --> 00:13:27.704
<v Speaker 2>these groups have actually always </v>
<v Speaker 2>commingled there necessary that they </v>

216
00:13:29.841 --> 00:13:32.030
<v Speaker 2>actually relate to each other in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>deeply healthy,</v>

217
00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:33.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and direct fashion.</v>

218
00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:35.223
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their separation into armed camps is </v>

219
00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:39.390
<v Speaker 2>extinction are actually,</v>

220
00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:40.463
<v Speaker 8>do you live the values of red that you </v>
<v Speaker 8>think blue needs to integrate or some </v>

221
00:13:42.661 --> 00:13:43.730
<v Speaker 8>way or to reintegrate?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

222
00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:45.193
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's actually pretty easy </v>

223
00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:47.830
<v Speaker 2>responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we've,</v>

224
00:13:47.831 --> 00:13:49.910
<v Speaker 2>we've actually even seen it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

225
00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:53.060
<v Speaker 2>the ability to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

226
00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:57.120
<v Speaker 2>make a commitment and keep it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

227
00:13:57.690 --> 00:13:59.520
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which by the way ideologically shows up.</v>

228
00:13:59.521 --> 00:14:01.880
<v Speaker 2>Is that a duty or loyalty?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But those are both ideologies.</v>

229
00:14:01.881 --> 00:14:02.180
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

230
00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:05.100
<v Speaker 2>the deeper sense is that ability,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

231
00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:08.620
<v Speaker 2>responsibility both at the individual </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the group level,</v>

232
00:14:08.621 --> 00:14:09.454
<v Speaker 2>the ability to actually really make a </v>
<v Speaker 2>personal sacrifice on the part of the </v>

233
00:14:14.291 --> 00:14:17.860
<v Speaker 2>group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's actually a deeply red value.</v>

234
00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:19.243
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't mean that by the way as </v>

235
00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:24.220
<v Speaker 2>politically ideological,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

236
00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:26.530
<v Speaker 2>certainly there are people who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

237
00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:29.900
<v Speaker 2>are currently part of blue who feel that</v>
<v Speaker 2>deeply.</v>

238
00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:32.210
<v Speaker 2>What I'm saying is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that shows up much,</v>

239
00:14:32.211 --> 00:14:36.730
<v Speaker 2>much more intensely in red.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you're feeling it in blue,</v>

240
00:14:36.731 --> 00:14:38.320
<v Speaker 2>you're actually feeling a red value and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's good.</v>

241
00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:40.540
<v Speaker 2>Mixing them is crucial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

242
00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:45.980
<v Speaker 8>cause that's very Jordan Peterson asks </v>
<v Speaker 8>to w how would you,</v>

243
00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:46.843
<v Speaker 8>how would you define Jordan Peterson or </v>
<v Speaker 8>do you think the fact that the issue is </v>

244
00:14:49.791 --> 00:14:52.100
<v Speaker 8>that he is,</v>
<v Speaker 8>is not within one of those</v>

245
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:53.960
<v Speaker 2>two camps?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the point.</v>

246
00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:58.280
<v Speaker 2>I think that he grasps directly the fact</v>
<v Speaker 2>that human beings can only actually make</v>

247
00:14:58.281 --> 00:15:03.281
<v Speaker 2>sense of the world by virtue of </v>
<v Speaker 2>communication with other human beings.</v>

248
00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:07.750
<v Speaker 2>And this is all about the notion of ad </v>
<v Speaker 2>mixture had that one must have a mixture</v>

249
00:15:07.751 --> 00:15:11.210
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of what I mean he uses the mythic poetic</v>

250
00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.760
<v Speaker 2>to make sense that the order order and </v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos,</v>

251
00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:15.133
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way or the Taoist way is the al </v>

252
00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:22.010
<v Speaker 2>chemical admixture of order and chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's it.</v>

253
00:15:22.011 --> 00:15:26.480
<v Speaker 2>Like that's how you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if you bias towards orderliness,</v>

254
00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:27.663
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you find yourself in a rigid </v>

255
00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.170
<v Speaker 2>non-adaptive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

256
00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:35.550
<v Speaker 2>noncreative not exploratory framework,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

257
00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:39.710
<v Speaker 2>which will die because the world changes</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you buy us towards chaos,</v>

258
00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:40.990
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

259
00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:43.680
<v Speaker 2>you eat your young and evaporate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

260
00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:46.290
<v Speaker 2>which also ties for obvious reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

261
00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:47.133
<v Speaker 2>and the key is to actually be enabled </v>
<v Speaker 2>these things to be in relationship with </v>

262
00:15:49.101 --> 00:15:51.290
<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And vital healthy relationship with each</v>

263
00:15:51.291 --> 00:15:52.750
<v Speaker 2>other and I think that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in some sense,</v>

264
00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:53.593
<v Speaker 2>the essence of what he's focusing on and</v>
<v Speaker 2>in sort of the core of what he's asking </v>

265
00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:57.660
<v Speaker 2>about it</v>

266
00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:02.000
<v Speaker 1>in his heart for the broadcast media to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get a handle on because the depth of his</v>

267
00:16:02.001 --> 00:16:05.570
<v Speaker 1>thought means he doesn't fit easily into</v>
<v Speaker 1>any of their categories.</v>

268
00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:07.183
<v Speaker 1>The clash with Kathy Newman was his </v>
<v Speaker 1>breakthrough moment where the new world </v>

269
00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:11.463
<v Speaker 1>met the old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to give the context from Kathy Newman </v>

270
00:16:13.881 --> 00:16:14.714
<v Speaker 1>side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she has to do dozens of interviews each </v>

271
00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:20.480
<v Speaker 1>month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peterson is hard to get a grip on and he</v>

272
00:16:20.481 --> 00:16:24.650
<v Speaker 1>sure as hell looks controversial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's also focused on getting soundbites</v>

273
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:27.290
<v Speaker 1>for a five minute cut down of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>interview for TV.</v>

274
00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:29.930
<v Speaker 1>Not a long conversation for online.</v>

275
00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:33.310
<v Speaker 9>The interview was ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It was a ridiculous interview.</v>

276
00:16:33.311 --> 00:16:34.144
<v Speaker 9>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I listened to it or watched it several </v>

277
00:16:35.531 --> 00:16:36.191
<v Speaker 9>times.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I was like,</v>

278
00:16:36.191 --> 00:16:37.024
<v Speaker 9>this is so strange.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's like her determination to turn it </v>

279
00:16:40.181 --> 00:16:41.014
<v Speaker 9>into a conflict too.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's one of the issues that I have with </v>

280
00:16:43.631 --> 00:16:44.800
<v Speaker 9>television shows.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

281
00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:45.723
<v Speaker 9>Because they have a very limited amount </v>
<v Speaker 9>of time and they're trying to make </v>

282
00:16:48.341 --> 00:16:51.540
<v Speaker 9>things as salacious as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 9>They want to have these soundbites,</v>

283
00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:52.633
<v Speaker 9>these clickbait soundbites,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and she just went into it incredibly </v>

284
00:16:56.561 --> 00:16:57.394
<v Speaker 9>confrontational.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Not Trying to find your actual </v>

285
00:16:58.871 --> 00:16:59.704
<v Speaker 9>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but trying to force you to defend a non </v>

286
00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:03.640
<v Speaker 9>nonrealistic.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

287
00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:04.690
<v Speaker 3>Perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

288
00:17:04.691 --> 00:17:05.524
<v Speaker 3>While I was at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was the hypothetical villain of her </v>

289
00:17:07.631 --> 00:17:09.430
<v Speaker 3>imagination essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

290
00:17:09.431 --> 00:17:14.050
<v Speaker 3>This is also why Youtube is going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>kill tv because television,</v>

291
00:17:14.051 --> 00:17:14.884
<v Speaker 3>by its nature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of these narrow broadcast </v>

292
00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:22.210
<v Speaker 3>technologies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they re they rely on forcing the story.</v>

293
00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:24.490
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it has to happen now.</v>

294
00:17:24.491 --> 00:17:28.300
<v Speaker 3>It has to happen like often in five </v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes because they only broadcast five</v>

295
00:17:28.301 --> 00:17:29.134
<v Speaker 3>minutes of that interview.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They did put the whole thing up on </v>

296
00:17:31.631 --> 00:17:32.860
<v Speaker 3>youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To their credit.</v>

297
00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:33.713
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

298
00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:37.180
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it hasn't ceased to amaze me yet.</v>

299
00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:40.930
<v Speaker 3>I think that they thought that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>interview went fine</v>

300
00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:42.443
<v Speaker 1>after the interview.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Channel Four news found themselves at </v>

301
00:17:44.551 --> 00:17:48.660
<v Speaker 1>the center of an online storm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which included some nasty,</v>

302
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:50.520
<v Speaker 1>a misogynistic</v>

303
00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:51.353
<v Speaker 8>attacks.</v>

304
00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:57.220
<v Speaker 8>It's understandable that they just </v>
<v Speaker 8>wanted it to go away,</v>

305
00:17:58.360 --> 00:17:59.193
<v Speaker 8>but online is forever and as the center </v>
<v Speaker 8>of gravity continues to shift away from </v>

306
00:18:03.401 --> 00:18:05.860
<v Speaker 8>traditional media,</v>
<v Speaker 8>this interview is,</v>

307
00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:06.723
<v Speaker 8>I would argue,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a slow motion and continuing car crash </v>

308
00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:13.570
<v Speaker 8>for Channel Four's credibility.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So why did it happen?</v>

309
00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:16.660
<v Speaker 8>Partly the limitations of the medium of </v>
<v Speaker 8>TV,</v>

310
00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:17.913
<v Speaker 8>but also because of the institutional </v>
<v Speaker 8>political blindness of the mainstream </v>

311
00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:22.023
<v Speaker 8>media.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I've always considered myself of the </v>

312
00:18:24.041 --> 00:18:24.874
<v Speaker 8>liberal left,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but especially since the election of </v>

313
00:18:26.651 --> 00:18:27.484
<v Speaker 8>trump,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I've been trying to understand what </v>

314
00:18:28.751 --> 00:18:29.584
<v Speaker 8>happened and I'm convinced that the </v>
<v Speaker 8>polarization we're seeing is mainly </v>

315
00:18:33.191 --> 00:18:36.430
<v Speaker 8>driven by the shadow side of liberalism </v>
<v Speaker 8>in particular,</v>

316
00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:41.560
<v Speaker 8>where supposedly inclusive social </v>
<v Speaker 8>justice liberalism stops being inclusive</v>

317
00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:45.490
<v Speaker 8>and secretly judges and despises people </v>
<v Speaker 8>that don't think the same way.</v>

318
00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:50.500
<v Speaker 8>The rebellion of trump and brexit was a </v>
<v Speaker 8>direct response.</v>

319
00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:52.120
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

320
00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:54.970
<v Speaker 8>As Eerie Harris argues in this article </v>
<v Speaker 8>in Colette,</v>

321
00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:56.283
<v Speaker 8>the new gatekeepers of the media have </v>
<v Speaker 8>become a new bourgeoisie in forcing a </v>

322
00:18:59.651 --> 00:19:00.484
<v Speaker 8>rigid etiquette and using the rights of </v>
<v Speaker 8>the oppressed as an excuse to put </v>

323
00:19:04.511 --> 00:19:07.930
<v Speaker 8>forward a vision of the kind of society </v>
<v Speaker 8>they personally want to live in.</v>

324
00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:10.793
<v Speaker 8>On the surface level,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's about how a narrow social justice </v>

325
00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:14.373
<v Speaker 8>worldview embodied by Kathy Newman in </v>
<v Speaker 8>the interview became the new status quo </v>

326
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:20.423
<v Speaker 8>and how this institutional bias of much </v>
<v Speaker 8>of the mainstream media means it can't </v>

327
00:19:24.421 --> 00:19:28.830
<v Speaker 8>see or understand the forces that are </v>
<v Speaker 8>challenging this new consensus.</v>

328
00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:33.180
<v Speaker 8>The counterculture used to be on the </v>
<v Speaker 8>left,</v>

329
00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:38.340
<v Speaker 8>but once it one the culture war,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it left space for a new counter culture,</v>

330
00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:42.600
<v Speaker 8>the biggest manifestation is the red </v>
<v Speaker 8>pill phenomena,</v>

331
00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.033
<v Speaker 8>which the mainstream media mistakenly </v>
<v Speaker 8>assumes is the same thing as the alt </v>

332
00:19:47.821 --> 00:19:48.654
<v Speaker 8>right.</v>

333
00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:53.080
<v Speaker 11>I was surprised to discover the overlap </v>
<v Speaker 11>between,</v>

334
00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:58.150
<v Speaker 11>um,</v>
<v Speaker 11>what I'm into a particularly like,</v>

335
00:19:58.250 --> 00:19:59.083
<v Speaker 11>um,</v>
<v Speaker 11>Greek philosophy and stoicism and the </v>

336
00:20:03.341 --> 00:20:05.710
<v Speaker 11>old right.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Who I'd always thought of,</v>

337
00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:06.880
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 11>if I come across from the tour,</v>

338
00:20:06.881 --> 00:20:09.190
<v Speaker 11>I thought that was kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 11>um,</v>

339
00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:12.130
<v Speaker 11>squibb allied boogie man,</v>
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>

340
00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:16.000
<v Speaker 11>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 11>completely unpalatable like extremists,</v>

341
00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:17.150
<v Speaker 11>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 11>in their,</v>

342
00:20:17.151 --> 00:20:20.230
<v Speaker 11>in their basements.</v>
<v Speaker 11>And then to discover that,</v>

343
00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:21.790
<v Speaker 11>um,</v>
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>

344
00:20:21.791 --> 00:20:22.624
<v Speaker 11>a lot of them were a lot of people in </v>
<v Speaker 11>stoicism and also really into the old </v>

345
00:20:26.471 --> 00:20:31.120
<v Speaker 11>right.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Made me wonder what was going on and why</v>

346
00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:34.390
<v Speaker 11>people like me.</v>
<v Speaker 11>We're getting radicalized,</v>

347
00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:37.470
<v Speaker 11>kind of drawn into it.</v>
<v Speaker 11>You're explaining what stoicism is for</v>

348
00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:43.270
<v Speaker 11>is basically an ancient Greek </v>
<v Speaker 11>philosophy,</v>

349
00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:45.360
<v Speaker 11>which,</v>
<v Speaker 11>um,</v>

350
00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:48.330
<v Speaker 11>with became very popular in the Roman,</v>
<v Speaker 11>uh,</v>

351
00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:49.000
<v Speaker 11>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>

352
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.230
<v Speaker 11>we did the emperor marcus or radius was </v>
<v Speaker 11>a stoic for example.</v>

353
00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:57.070
<v Speaker 11>And it's in some ways like a Western </v>
<v Speaker 11>form of Buddhism.</v>

354
00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:58.173
<v Speaker 11>It's like a therapy for the emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 11>It teaches you to take responsibility </v>

355
00:21:02.051 --> 00:21:04.420
<v Speaker 11>for your thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 11>to take a nearby,</v>

356
00:21:04.421 --> 00:21:05.254
<v Speaker 11>to take some control of your emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 11>So in some ways it's putting forward a </v>

357
00:21:09.671 --> 00:21:14.671
<v Speaker 11>model of a strength and integrity and </v>
<v Speaker 11>kind of resilience.</v>

358
00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:19.060
<v Speaker 11>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I made adversity and rapid change.</v>

359
00:21:19.061 --> 00:21:23.590
<v Speaker 11>So for that reason it's become very </v>
<v Speaker 11>popular in the last 10 years.</v>

360
00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:27.040
<v Speaker 12>I think this is also why from my </v>
<v Speaker 12>perspective,</v>

361
00:21:27.041 --> 00:21:27.874
<v Speaker 12>at least someone like Jordan Peterson is</v>
<v Speaker 12>often looked from the outside as being </v>

362
00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:34.090
<v Speaker 12>aligned with the alt right because he </v>
<v Speaker 12>has a similar message.</v>

363
00:21:34.091 --> 00:21:36.490
<v Speaker 12>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 12>there are crucial differences I think,</v>

364
00:21:36.491 --> 00:21:39.580
<v Speaker 12>between what we would consider.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I mean,</v>

365
00:21:39.581 --> 00:21:43.030
<v Speaker 12>certainly white nationalism would be an </v>
<v Speaker 12>essential part of the outright,</v>

366
00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:44.710
<v Speaker 12>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 12>of any useful definition.</v>

367
00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:48.040
<v Speaker 12>And that's certainly not characteristic </v>
<v Speaker 12>of,</v>

368
00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:49.600
<v Speaker 12>of Jordan Peterson from my experience,</v>

369
00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:54.780
<v Speaker 11>there's a crucial difference at least </v>
<v Speaker 11>between stoicism and your right.</v>

370
00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:56.063
<v Speaker 11>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 11>even though a lot of old writers into </v>

371
00:21:57.441 --> 00:22:02.130
<v Speaker 11>stoicism ending that stoicism and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 11>Jordan Peterson as well.</v>

372
00:22:02.131 --> 00:22:03.840
<v Speaker 11>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I'm not an expert on him.</v>

373
00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:09.140
<v Speaker 11>Talk about the way to gain strength and </v>
<v Speaker 11>maturity and power is internal.</v>

374
00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:15.180
<v Speaker 11>It's to take responsibility for your own</v>
<v Speaker 11>thoughts and feelings.</v>

375
00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:16.553
<v Speaker 11>Whilst I think people,</v>
<v Speaker 11>sometimes men white look for that sense </v>

376
00:22:20.011 --> 00:22:25.011
<v Speaker 11>of power and control externally by </v>
<v Speaker 11>suppressing or,</v>

377
00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:26.793
<v Speaker 11>or,</v>
<v Speaker 11>or segregating anyone who they feel </v>

378
00:22:29.251 --> 00:22:30.084
<v Speaker 11>threatened by,</v>
<v Speaker 11>whether that's other colors or other </v>

379
00:22:32.731 --> 00:22:34.120
<v Speaker 11>sexualities or,</v>
<v Speaker 11>or,</v>

380
00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:35.130
<v Speaker 11>or,</v>
<v Speaker 11>or gender.</v>

381
00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:39.360
<v Speaker 11>So there's a crucial difference there.</v>
<v Speaker 11>One is about kind of inner integrity,</v>

382
00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:40.160
<v Speaker 11>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 11>and,</v>

383
00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:41.520
<v Speaker 11>and,</v>
<v Speaker 11>and it just kind of,</v>

384
00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:43.290
<v Speaker 11>um,</v>
<v Speaker 11>being strong within yourself.</v>

385
00:22:43.291 --> 00:22:44.124
<v Speaker 11>And the other is about trying to take </v>
<v Speaker 11>control through the kind of exterior </v>

386
00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:49.350
<v Speaker 11>borders and fences,</v>
<v Speaker 11>if you see what I mean.</v>

387
00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:50.493
<v Speaker 13>Every public appearance that I've made </v>
<v Speaker 13>that's related to the sort of topics </v>

388
00:22:53.321 --> 00:22:55.630
<v Speaker 13>that we're discussing is overwhelmingly,</v>
<v Speaker 13>man,</v>

389
00:22:56.170 --> 00:22:58.540
<v Speaker 13>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 13>it's like 85 to 90%.</v>

390
00:22:59.020 --> 00:22:59.801
<v Speaker 13>And so I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 13>wow,</v>

391
00:22:59.801 --> 00:23:01.660
<v Speaker 13>that's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Like what the hell's going on here.</v>

392
00:23:01.661 --> 00:23:04.180
<v Speaker 13>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 13>And then the other thing I've noticed is</v>

393
00:23:04.181 --> 00:23:07.960
<v Speaker 13>that I've been talking a lot to the </v>
<v Speaker 13>crowds that I'd be talking to,</v>

394
00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:09.910
<v Speaker 13>not about rights,</v>
<v Speaker 13>but about responsibility,</v>

395
00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:10.983
<v Speaker 13>right?</v>
<v Speaker 13>Because he can't have the bloody </v>

396
00:23:11.921 --> 00:23:13.060
<v Speaker 13>converse.</v>
<v Speaker 13>What are you doing?</v>

397
00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:13.923
<v Speaker 13>You can't have the conversation about </v>
<v Speaker 13>rights without the conversation about </v>

398
00:23:16.691 --> 00:23:20.740
<v Speaker 13>responsibility because your rights are </v>
<v Speaker 13>my responsibility.</v>

399
00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:25.600
<v Speaker 13>That's what they are technically.</v>
<v Speaker 13>So you just can't have only half of that</v>

400
00:23:25.601 --> 00:23:27.970
<v Speaker 13>discussion and we're only having half </v>
<v Speaker 13>that discussion.</v>

401
00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:29.201
<v Speaker 13>And the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 13>well,</v>

402
00:23:29.201 --> 00:23:33.520
<v Speaker 13>what the hell are you leaving out if you</v>
<v Speaker 13>only have that half of the discussion?</v>

403
00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.250
<v Speaker 13>And the answer is what?</v>
<v Speaker 13>You're leaving out responsibility.</v>

404
00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:38.740
<v Speaker 13>And then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 13>well what are you leaving out?</v>

405
00:23:38.741 --> 00:23:41.590
<v Speaker 13>If you're leaving out responsibility?</v>
<v Speaker 13>And the answer might be,</v>

406
00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:43.690
<v Speaker 13>well maybe you're leaving out the </v>
<v Speaker 13>meaning of life.</v>

407
00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:49.220
<v Speaker 13>That's what looks like to me.</v>
<v Speaker 13>It's like here you are suffering away.</v>

408
00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:51.740
<v Speaker 13>What makes it worthwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 13>right?</v>

409
00:23:52.610 --> 00:23:53.850
<v Speaker 13>You know you're completely,</v>
<v Speaker 13>oh,</v>

410
00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:58.400
<v Speaker 13>you're completely,</v>
<v Speaker 13>you have no idea what you're you.</v>

411
00:23:58.401 --> 00:24:03.260
<v Speaker 13>It's almost impossible to describe how </v>
<v Speaker 13>bad an idea that is.</v>

412
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:07.970
<v Speaker 13>Responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 13>That's what gives life meaning.</v>

413
00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:12.170
<v Speaker 13>It's like lift a load,</v>
<v Speaker 13>then you can tolerate yourself.</v>

414
00:24:12.171 --> 00:24:13.910
<v Speaker 13>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 13>Cause look at your useless,</v>

415
00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:16.460
<v Speaker 13>easily hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 13>easily killed.</v>

416
00:24:16.461 --> 00:24:20.240
<v Speaker 13>Why should you have any self respect?</v>
<v Speaker 13>That's the story of the fall.</v>

417
00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:22.670
<v Speaker 13>Pick something up and carry it.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Pick,</v>

418
00:24:22.671 --> 00:24:24.410
<v Speaker 13>make it heavy enough so that you can </v>
<v Speaker 13>think,</v>

419
00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:26.840
<v Speaker 13>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 13>well useless as I am.</v>

420
00:24:26.841 --> 00:24:29.210
<v Speaker 13>At least I could move that from there to</v>
<v Speaker 13>there.</v>

421
00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:33.170
<v Speaker 13>Well what's really cool about that is </v>
<v Speaker 13>that when I talked to these crowds about</v>

422
00:24:33.171 --> 00:24:34.004
<v Speaker 13>this,</v>
<v Speaker 13>the man's eyes light up and that's very </v>

423
00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:37.183
<v Speaker 13>like I've seen that phenomena because </v>
<v Speaker 13>I've been talking about this </v>

424
00:24:38.541 --> 00:24:41.570
<v Speaker 13>mythological material for a long time </v>
<v Speaker 13>and I can see when I'm watching crowds,</v>

425
00:24:41.571 --> 00:24:43.700
<v Speaker 13>people,</v>
<v Speaker 13>you know their eyebrows lift,</v>

426
00:24:43.701 --> 00:24:47.120
<v Speaker 13>their eyes light up because I've put </v>
<v Speaker 13>something together for them,</v>

427
00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:48.980
<v Speaker 13>not sweat,</v>
<v Speaker 13>mythological stories do.</v>

428
00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.930
<v Speaker 13>So I'm not taking responsibility for </v>
<v Speaker 13>that.</v>

429
00:24:50.931 --> 00:24:53.150
<v Speaker 13>That's what the story is due.</v>
<v Speaker 13>So I say this story,</v>

430
00:24:53.151 --> 00:24:54.110
<v Speaker 13>when people go click,</v>
<v Speaker 13>click,</v>

431
00:24:54.111 --> 00:24:55.880
<v Speaker 13>click,</v>
<v Speaker 13>you know when their eyes light up.</v>

432
00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:59.240
<v Speaker 13>But this responsibility thing,</v>
<v Speaker 13>that's a whole new order of this is that</v>

433
00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:02.600
<v Speaker 13>young men are so hungry for that.</v>
<v Speaker 13>It is unbelievable.</v>

434
00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:04.490
<v Speaker 13>It just blows me away.</v>
<v Speaker 13>It's like,</v>

435
00:25:04.491 --> 00:25:06.410
<v Speaker 13>really?</v>
<v Speaker 13>That's what's,</v>

436
00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:07.573
<v Speaker 13>that's the counterculture.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Grow the hell up and do something </v>

437
00:25:11.481 --> 00:25:12.380
<v Speaker 13>useful.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Really.</v>

438
00:25:12.381 --> 00:25:13.220
<v Speaker 13>I could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Oh,</v>

439
00:25:13.221 --> 00:25:16.880
<v Speaker 13>I'm so excited by that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 13>No one ever mentioned that before.</v>

440
00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:18.110
<v Speaker 13>It's like rights,</v>
<v Speaker 13>rights,</v>

441
00:25:18.111 --> 00:25:19.040
<v Speaker 13>rights,</v>
<v Speaker 13>rights,</v>

442
00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:20.200
<v Speaker 13>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 13>It's,</v>

443
00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:22.070
<v Speaker 13>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 13>it's appalling.</v>

444
00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:23.060
<v Speaker 13>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 13>it's,</v>

445
00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:23.893
<v Speaker 13>and,</v>
<v Speaker 13>and I feel that that's deeply felt by </v>

446
00:25:25.251 --> 00:25:27.650
<v Speaker 13>the people who are,</v>
<v Speaker 13>who are coming out to,</v>

447
00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:30.230
<v Speaker 13>to listen to these sorts of things,</v>
<v Speaker 13>to there.</v>

448
00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:32.750
<v Speaker 13>They've had enough of that.</v>
<v Speaker 13>So,</v>

449
00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:33.643
<v Speaker 13>and they better have because it's a </v>
<v Speaker 13>nonproductive motive being </v>

450
00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:37.550
<v Speaker 13>responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Man.</v>

451
00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:38.723
<v Speaker 1>Peterson is part of the counterculture </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he describes himself as a classic </v>

452
00:25:42.211 --> 00:25:46.560
<v Speaker 1>liberal and yet he's frequently </v>
<v Speaker 1>described as right wing by the media.</v>

453
00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:51.510
<v Speaker 1>This is not limited to Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>James Damore is infamous.</v>

454
00:25:51.511 --> 00:25:56.511
<v Speaker 1>Google memo was described everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an anti diversity screed despite</v>

455
00:25:56.761 --> 00:25:57.594
<v Speaker 1>him specifically stating he wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>encourage more diversity in the </v>

456
00:26:00.481 --> 00:26:01.314
<v Speaker 1>workplace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many believe that the channel four </v>

457
00:26:10.261 --> 00:26:12.990
<v Speaker 1>interview,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a significant moment and exposing</v>

458
00:26:12.991 --> 00:26:17.310
<v Speaker 1>this mindset as dogmatic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reactionary and fixed.</v>

459
00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:20.690
<v Speaker 2>So during the interview we see an </v>
<v Speaker 2>example of a,</v>

460
00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:21.460
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

461
00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:22.293
<v Speaker 2>a delusional framework that is what </v>
<v Speaker 2>appears to be largely incapable of </v>

462
00:26:26.691 --> 00:26:29.260
<v Speaker 2>perceiving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reacting to reality in real time.</v>

463
00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:32.600
<v Speaker 2>But much more interesting is what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened afterwards,</v>

464
00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:33.753
<v Speaker 2>which was the sort of the self healing </v>
<v Speaker 2>and policing mechanism of the larger </v>

465
00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:41.030
<v Speaker 2>social consensus of how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

466
00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:41.963
<v Speaker 2>how the Blue Church</v>
<v Speaker 2>reactively goes about maintaining the </v>

467
00:26:47.071 --> 00:26:50.290
<v Speaker 2>integrity of its frame.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

468
00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:52.470
<v Speaker 2>and so what ended up happening was there</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a break in the frame,</v>

469
00:26:52.471 --> 00:26:54.630
<v Speaker 2>there was a glitch in the matrix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

470
00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:58.830
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanisms of the Blue Church reacted to</v>

471
00:26:58.831 --> 00:26:59.664
<v Speaker 2>endeavor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to control the frame and to convert it </v>

472
00:27:01.471 --> 00:27:03.150
<v Speaker 2>into a way of sense of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

473
00:27:03.151 --> 00:27:05.310
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making sense of the,</v>

474
00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:08.270
<v Speaker 2>what occurred that still maintained the </v>
<v Speaker 2>integrity of its frame.</v>

475
00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:10.970
<v Speaker 2>And you can do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you mean when they tried to characterize</v>

476
00:27:10.971 --> 00:27:11.804
<v Speaker 2>it as a sort of abusive trolls and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll write hero and all of that is </v>

477
00:27:15.981 --> 00:27:19.730
<v Speaker 2>actually exactly the sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to use a military language.</v>

478
00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:22.520
<v Speaker 2>It was a fall back position that was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>reactive,</v>

479
00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:25.550
<v Speaker 2>almost instinctual and not all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most in fact precisely.</v>

480
00:27:25.551 --> 00:27:27.420
<v Speaker 2>Instinction was that pure habit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

481
00:27:27.421 --> 00:27:29.530
<v Speaker 2>there was no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

482
00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:32.790
<v Speaker 2>thoughtfulness or even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

483
00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:36.380
<v Speaker 2>strategic action.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There it was.</v>

484
00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:37.513
<v Speaker 2>If if x,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then y and in this case why is here's a </v>

485
00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:41.453
<v Speaker 2>set of things that one does to </v>
<v Speaker 2>reestablish the dominant frame and now </v>

486
00:27:46.141 --> 00:27:47.750
<v Speaker 2>we're now we're two levels deep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

487
00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:51.420
<v Speaker 2>the first level was a sort of self </v>
<v Speaker 2>evident disaster,</v>

488
00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:52.433
<v Speaker 2>but then the second level was also a </v>
<v Speaker 2>relatively self avid disaster and there </v>

489
00:27:56.841 --> 00:27:59.110
<v Speaker 2>isn't really a third level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

490
00:27:59.140 --> 00:27:59.973
<v Speaker 2>in this approach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it ends up happening and this is </v>

491
00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:02.223
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can kind of just think about this </v>

492
00:28:02.921 --> 00:28:06.040
<v Speaker 2>from ordinary psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

493
00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:10.000
<v Speaker 2>this is how delusions fall apart because</v>
<v Speaker 2>try as we might,</v>

494
00:28:10.330 --> 00:28:14.600
<v Speaker 2>our desire to interpret reality to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we want it to mean at the end of the</v>

495
00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:18.500
<v Speaker 2>day will always be checked against what </v>
<v Speaker 2>reality actually is.</v>

496
00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:20.910
<v Speaker 2>Maybe some time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

497
00:28:20.911 --> 00:28:21.820
<v Speaker 2>we're pretty good at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at,</v>

498
00:28:21.821 --> 00:28:23.670
<v Speaker 2>at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at making things up in pretending,</v>

499
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.820
<v Speaker 2>but eventually reality is reality.</v>

500
00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:29.780
<v Speaker 8>This isn't to say that Peterson is not </v>
<v Speaker 8>controversial.</v>

501
00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:31.483
<v Speaker 8>He's saying things that challenge the </v>
<v Speaker 8>most deeply held assumptions of the new </v>

502
00:28:34.731 --> 00:28:36.110
<v Speaker 8>establishment narrative.</v>

503
00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:37.223
<v Speaker 3>I guess the other reason that people are</v>
<v Speaker 3>on my case to some degree is because I </v>

504
00:28:40.981 --> 00:28:44.340
<v Speaker 3>have made a strong case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I think is fully documented by the</v>

505
00:28:44.341 --> 00:28:47.040
<v Speaker 3>scientific literature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there are intrinsic differences say</v>

506
00:28:47.041 --> 00:28:49.470
<v Speaker 3>between men and women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think the evidence on that,</v>

507
00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:50.543
<v Speaker 3>this is the thing that staggered me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that no serious scientists have </v>

508
00:28:54.481 --> 00:28:55.314
<v Speaker 3>debated that for like four decades.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's that argument was done by the time </v>

509
00:29:00.571 --> 00:29:03.840
<v Speaker 3>I went to graduate school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone knew that human beings,</v>

510
00:29:03.841 --> 00:29:04.674
<v Speaker 3>we're not a blank slate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That biological forces parameterize the </v>

511
00:29:09.421 --> 00:29:12.840
<v Speaker 3>way that we thought and felt and acted </v>
<v Speaker 3>in and,</v>

512
00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:13.733
<v Speaker 3>and valued.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone knew that the fact that this </v>

513
00:29:15.811 --> 00:29:18.120
<v Speaker 3>has become somehow debatable again is </v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

514
00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:21.150
<v Speaker 3>especially because it's being done by </v>
<v Speaker 3>legislative Fiat,</v>

515
00:29:21.151 --> 00:29:21.990
<v Speaker 3>they're forcing it</v>

516
00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:23.653
<v Speaker 8>pause.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Peterson's argument based on years of </v>

517
00:29:25.671 --> 00:29:29.630
<v Speaker 8>psychological research is that much of </v>
<v Speaker 8>the political conflicts,</v>

518
00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:30.793
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>due to try to integrate the different </v>

519
00:29:32.061 --> 00:29:34.910
<v Speaker 8>political temperaments of men and women.</v>

520
00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:36.563
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about the relatively,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the relative evolutionary roles of men </v>

521
00:29:39.601 --> 00:29:41.710
<v Speaker 3>and women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is speculative obviously.</v>

522
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:42.903
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and because our research did indicate </v>

523
00:29:44.921 --> 00:29:47.710
<v Speaker 4>it's tentative research so far that that</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

524
00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:48.603
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the SGS sjw sort of equality above all </v>

525
00:29:51.641 --> 00:29:55.210
<v Speaker 4>else philosophy is more prevalent among </v>
<v Speaker 4>women.</v>

526
00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:57.413
<v Speaker 4>It's predicted by the personality </v>
<v Speaker 4>factors that are more common among </v>

527
00:30:00.221 --> 00:30:01.054
<v Speaker 4>women.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So agreeableness and high negative </v>

528
00:30:02.681 --> 00:30:05.020
<v Speaker 4>emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>primarily agreeableness.</v>

529
00:30:05.290 --> 00:30:08.230
<v Speaker 4>But in addition it's also predicted by </v>
<v Speaker 4>being female.</v>

530
00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:11.440
<v Speaker 4>And so I've been thinking about that a </v>
<v Speaker 4>lot because,</v>

531
00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:12.843
<v Speaker 4>well men are bailing out of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>humanities like mad and pretty much out </v>

532
00:30:15.521 --> 00:30:16.354
<v Speaker 4>of the universities except for stem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the women are moving in like mad and </v>

533
00:30:19.331 --> 00:30:22.060
<v Speaker 4>they're also moving into the political </v>
<v Speaker 4>sphere like mad.</v>

534
00:30:22.061 --> 00:30:23.020
<v Speaker 4>And this is new,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

535
00:30:23.021 --> 00:30:24.910
<v Speaker 4>We've never had this happen before and </v>
<v Speaker 4>we do.</v>

536
00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:25.480
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

537
00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:27.370
<v Speaker 4>do not know what the significance of it </v>
<v Speaker 4>is.</v>

538
00:30:27.490 --> 00:30:28.323
<v Speaker 4>It's only 50 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so we were thinking about this and </v>

539
00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:33.400
<v Speaker 4>so I don't know what you think about </v>
<v Speaker 4>this proposition,</v>

540
00:30:33.401 --> 00:30:35.100
<v Speaker 4>but imagine that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

541
00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:35.963
<v Speaker 4>that historically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's something like women were </v>

542
00:30:39.821 --> 00:30:43.180
<v Speaker 4>responsible for distribution and men </v>
<v Speaker 4>were responsible for production.</v>

543
00:30:44.050 --> 00:30:45.820
<v Speaker 4>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And maybe,</v>

544
00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:46.673
<v Speaker 4>and maybe that's only the case really in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the tight confines of the immediate </v>

545
00:30:49.661 --> 00:30:50.494
<v Speaker 4>family,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that doesn't matter because that's </v>

546
00:30:51.371 --> 00:30:53.950
<v Speaker 4>most of the evolutionary landscape for </v>
<v Speaker 4>human beings anyways.</v>

547
00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:57.460
<v Speaker 4>What the women does it did was make sure</v>
<v Speaker 4>that everybody got enough.</v>

548
00:30:58.510 --> 00:30:59.343
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that seems to me to be one of the </v>

549
00:31:00.251 --> 00:31:04.600
<v Speaker 4>things that's driving,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least in part the sjw demand for,</v>

550
00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:06.370
<v Speaker 4>for equity and equality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

551
00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:09.160
<v Speaker 4>let's make sure everybody has enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

552
00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:10.150
<v Speaker 4>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fair enough.</v>

553
00:31:10.151 --> 00:31:10.801
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you,</v>

554
00:31:10.801 --> 00:31:12.550
<v Speaker 4>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't argue with that.</v>

555
00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:13.593
<v Speaker 4>But there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's an antipathy between that and </v>

556
00:31:16.510 --> 00:31:19.240
<v Speaker 4>the reality of differential </v>
<v Speaker 4>productivity.</v>

557
00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:21.160
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because people really do differ in their</v>

558
00:31:21.161 --> 00:31:21.994
<v Speaker 4>productivity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that the sjw phenomena is </v>

559
00:31:24.341 --> 00:31:25.174
<v Speaker 4>different and I think it is associated </v>
<v Speaker 4>at least in part with the rise of women </v>

560
00:31:27.971 --> 00:31:28.804
<v Speaker 4>to political power and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we don't know what women are like </v>

561
00:31:32.621 --> 00:31:35.410
<v Speaker 4>when they have political power because </v>
<v Speaker 4>they've never had it.</v>

562
00:31:36.130 --> 00:31:38.530
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's been queens obviously and</v>
<v Speaker 4>that sort of thing.</v>

563
00:31:38.531 --> 00:31:39.364
<v Speaker 4>Just being female authority figures and </v>
<v Speaker 4>females have wielded far more power </v>

564
00:31:42.191 --> 00:31:44.560
<v Speaker 4>historically than feminists generally </v>
<v Speaker 4>like to admit.</v>

565
00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:47.170
<v Speaker 4>But this is a different thing and we </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't know what,</v>

566
00:31:47.171 --> 00:31:50.320
<v Speaker 4>what I've truly female political </v>
<v Speaker 4>philosophy would be like,</v>

567
00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:51.423
<v Speaker 4>but it might be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially if it's not being well </v>

568
00:31:53.471 --> 00:31:55.930
<v Speaker 4>examined and it isn't very sophisticated</v>
<v Speaker 4>conceptually,</v>

569
00:31:55.931 --> 00:31:57.130
<v Speaker 4>it could easily be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

570
00:31:57.131 --> 00:31:59.650
<v Speaker 4>let's makes sure things are distributed </v>
<v Speaker 4>equally well.</v>

571
00:31:59.651 --> 00:32:01.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but sorry,</v>

572
00:32:02.610 --> 00:32:07.610
<v Speaker 1>fly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the Peterson's main influences is</v>

573
00:32:08.941 --> 00:32:09.774
<v Speaker 1>the psychologist Carl Young human </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology was built around the concept </v>

574
00:32:13.831 --> 00:32:16.560
<v Speaker 1>of the shadow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the things about ourselves.</v>

575
00:32:16.561 --> 00:32:20.340
<v Speaker 1>We don't want to accept our anger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>negativity,</v>

576
00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:21.623
<v Speaker 1>unconscious judgments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how we need to integrate all those </v>

577
00:32:24.511 --> 00:32:29.280
<v Speaker 1>disowned parts to grow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm convinced that's what's happening on</v>

578
00:32:29.281 --> 00:32:33.510
<v Speaker 1>a vast cultural level since leaving </v>
<v Speaker 1>channel four news.</v>

579
00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:34.373
<v Speaker 1>I've retrained as a counselor and </v>
<v Speaker 1>started leading personal growth </v>

580
00:32:37.201 --> 00:32:38.034
<v Speaker 1>workshops for men on thought a lot about</v>
<v Speaker 1>how these unconscious gender dynamics </v>

581
00:32:42.201 --> 00:32:43.034
<v Speaker 1>are playing out in the culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the central concepts is Yum's </v>

582
00:32:47.091 --> 00:32:47.924
<v Speaker 1>idea of animus anima possession,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or we each have both an inner masculine </v>

583
00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:57.320
<v Speaker 1>and feminine essence in a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he's unconsciously possessed by his</v>

584
00:32:57.321 --> 00:32:58.790
<v Speaker 1>feminine side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his Anima,</v>

585
00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:02.090
<v Speaker 1>he becomes withdrawn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moody and reactive.</v>

586
00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:05.300
<v Speaker 1>And when a woman is possessed by her </v>
<v Speaker 1>male side,</v>

587
00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:08.660
<v Speaker 1>the animus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she becomes aggressive and dominating.</v>

588
00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:14.000
<v Speaker 1>And how many women are pushed into that </v>
<v Speaker 1>by the nature of the modern workplace.</v>

589
00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:17.240
<v Speaker 1>The Kathy Newman I know is warm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>compassionate,</v>

590
00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:19.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>successful and talented journalist.</v>

591
00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:20.713
<v Speaker 1>None of this is criticism of her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the role she was playing in the </v>

592
00:33:23.571 --> 00:33:24.404
<v Speaker 1>interview.</v>

593
00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:25.263
<v Speaker 5>I would say technically,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this is might be interesting for </v>

594
00:33:27.251 --> 00:33:29.350
<v Speaker 5>people who were interested in union </v>
<v Speaker 5>psychology.</v>

595
00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:33.550
<v Speaker 5>If you want to understand what Carl Jung</v>
<v Speaker 5>meant by animus possession,</v>

596
00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:34.543
<v Speaker 5>which is a very difficult concept then </v>
<v Speaker 5>that that interview was a textbook case </v>

597
00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:42.520
<v Speaker 5>of having a discussion with someone who </v>
<v Speaker 5>is animus,</v>

598
00:33:42.521 --> 00:33:43.354
<v Speaker 5>possessed life has been moving forward </v>
<v Speaker 5>for three and a half billion years and </v>

599
00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:51.340
<v Speaker 5>it moves forward in these pattern </v>
<v Speaker 5>matters,</v>

600
00:33:51.341 --> 00:33:53.110
<v Speaker 5>like the dominance hierarchy for </v>
<v Speaker 5>example.</v>

601
00:33:53.111 --> 00:33:55.810
<v Speaker 5>So that's that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's call that the masculine archetype.</v>

602
00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:58.450
<v Speaker 5>It's part of the masculine archetype.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>

603
00:33:58.490 --> 00:34:03.490
<v Speaker 5>youngest proclamation was that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>female representation of the mail.</v>

604
00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:08.380
<v Speaker 5>So that's the animus is the dominance </v>
<v Speaker 5>hierarchy.</v>

605
00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:11.940
<v Speaker 5>It's the patriarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's the,</v>

606
00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:12.843
<v Speaker 5>that's the unconscious archetype,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which I think is extremely interesting </v>

607
00:34:15.641 --> 00:34:16.474
<v Speaker 5>given what's happened,</v>
<v Speaker 5>say in the women's movement because </v>

608
00:34:18.161 --> 00:34:18.994
<v Speaker 5>that's what's projected onto men and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it can be projected in a very </v>

609
00:34:23.471 --> 00:34:24.760
<v Speaker 5>negative way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't have to be,</v>

610
00:34:24.761 --> 00:34:29.110
<v Speaker 5>but it can be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so an animus possessed woman treat a</v>

611
00:34:29.111 --> 00:34:32.440
<v Speaker 5>man as if he's the manifestation of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>tyrannical patriarchy.</v>

612
00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:35.140
<v Speaker 5>He's a group.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's that group of men.</v>

613
00:34:35.890 --> 00:34:37.260
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the group of bad band.</v>

614
00:34:37.261 --> 00:34:41.050
<v Speaker 5>Now actually you watch the Jordan </v>
<v Speaker 5>Peterson Kathy Newman interview.</v>

615
00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:42.250
<v Speaker 5>What did he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what did he think?</v>

616
00:34:42.251 --> 00:34:43.084
<v Speaker 5>Thank</v>

617
00:34:43.770 --> 00:34:47.030
<v Speaker 14>who I,</v>
<v Speaker 14>my whole body contracted and I,</v>

618
00:34:47.031 --> 00:34:52.031
<v Speaker 14>I felt so sad for womanhood.</v>
<v Speaker 14>I felt disappointed and um,</v>

619
00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:02.780
<v Speaker 14>I could see how the shadow part of </v>
<v Speaker 14>womanhood was acting out.</v>

620
00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:09.200
<v Speaker 14>I could see how the collective rage was </v>
<v Speaker 14>acting through Kathy Newman.</v>

621
00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:11.573
<v Speaker 14>And this is what happens is that when </v>
<v Speaker 14>that's unknown and it's projected </v>

622
00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:21.060
<v Speaker 14>blindly on to whatever stick,</v>
<v Speaker 14>whatever it sticks.</v>

623
00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:22.373
<v Speaker 14>And it was very clear that she already </v>
<v Speaker 14>had an agenda and she already had a </v>

624
00:35:25.231 --> 00:35:28.530
<v Speaker 14>projection that she was just looking to </v>
<v Speaker 14>stay.</v>

625
00:35:28.531 --> 00:35:29.364
<v Speaker 14>She was,</v>
<v Speaker 14>she was just looking to have that </v>

626
00:35:30.721 --> 00:35:34.050
<v Speaker 14>confirmed.</v>
<v Speaker 14>So I felt on behalf of women,</v>

627
00:35:34.410 --> 00:35:39.410
<v Speaker 14>I felt sad and disappointed because we </v>
<v Speaker 14>to have intelligent conversations.</v>

628
00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:43.630
<v Speaker 12>And I also want to say that this isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 12>even though the,</v>

629
00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:46.900
<v Speaker 12>the specific example is the Kathy Newman</v>
<v Speaker 12>Jordan an interview.</v>

630
00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:50.080
<v Speaker 12>It's not specific to,</v>
<v Speaker 12>to Kathy Newman.</v>

631
00:35:50.110 --> 00:35:50.943
<v Speaker 12>I think the fact that that interview has</v>
<v Speaker 12>resonated with so many people that has </v>

632
00:35:53.921 --> 00:35:54.754
<v Speaker 12>been so popular shows that actually </v>
<v Speaker 12>something archetype was going on in </v>

633
00:35:59.201 --> 00:36:00.700
<v Speaker 12>that,</v>
<v Speaker 12>in that interaction.</v>

634
00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:01.983
<v Speaker 12>And I think as well,</v>
<v Speaker 12>why it's gone viral is a lot of people </v>

635
00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:09.130
<v Speaker 12>watching it recognize those dynamics.</v>
<v Speaker 12>They're like,</v>

636
00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:10.810
<v Speaker 12>I've been in conversations like that.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Yeah.</v>

637
00:36:10.990 --> 00:36:11.823
<v Speaker 12>I've been in this conversation when </v>
<v Speaker 12>nothing I say works when nothing I say </v>

638
00:36:14.861 --> 00:36:15.730
<v Speaker 12>he gets through.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Yeah.</v>

639
00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:18.160
<v Speaker 12>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 12>so there's something sort of fundamental</v>

640
00:36:18.161 --> 00:36:21.430
<v Speaker 12>about about the masculine and feminine </v>
<v Speaker 12>dynamic that is going on in there.</v>

641
00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:22.653
<v Speaker 12>What do you think that is?</v>

642
00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:25.460
<v Speaker 14>I think Jordan Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 14>he's every man.</v>

643
00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:27.830
<v Speaker 14>Kathy Newman,</v>
<v Speaker 14>she's every woman.</v>

644
00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:29.143
<v Speaker 14>I can tap into that rage like this.</v>
<v Speaker 14>I know it in myself and women that say </v>

645
00:36:33.081 --> 00:36:33.914
<v Speaker 14>they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 14>they just denying it because it is in </v>

646
00:36:36.411 --> 00:36:37.244
<v Speaker 14>the collective.</v>
<v Speaker 14>So in that sense it just highlighted </v>

647
00:36:39.771 --> 00:36:40.700
<v Speaker 14>what,</v>
<v Speaker 14>what's there.</v>

648
00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:45.880
<v Speaker 14>It's wonderful because here we really </v>
<v Speaker 14>get to look at why is this so important?</v>

649
00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:48.883
<v Speaker 14>Why is it so important to listen to,</v>
<v Speaker 14>to a thinker like Jordan Peterson and </v>

650
00:36:54.141 --> 00:36:57.200
<v Speaker 14>take it seriously and say,</v>
<v Speaker 14>what can we do with it?</v>

651
00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:02.560
<v Speaker 14>It's just so obvious that it's needed </v>
<v Speaker 14>because if this is where we are,</v>

652
00:37:02.841 --> 00:37:05.150
<v Speaker 14>if this is where society and cultures </v>
<v Speaker 14>is,</v>

653
00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:06.133
<v Speaker 14>if this is the ability to have an </v>
<v Speaker 14>intelligent conversations conversation </v>

654
00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:10.543
<v Speaker 14>than we are in trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 14>I really feel that there is this </v>

655
00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:13.753
<v Speaker 14>collective,</v>
<v Speaker 14>subconscious rage that is just boiling </v>

656
00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:22.340
<v Speaker 14>in women and it's coming up in so many </v>
<v Speaker 14>ways.</v>

657
00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:24.100
<v Speaker 14>We see,</v>
<v Speaker 14>we see in the media and,</v>

658
00:37:24.101 --> 00:37:29.101
<v Speaker 14>and,</v>
<v Speaker 14>and what's going on is this unknown rage</v>

659
00:37:29.570 --> 00:37:31.760
<v Speaker 14>that comes up in,</v>
<v Speaker 14>in many different ways.</v>

660
00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:36.500
<v Speaker 14>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 14>and on one hand it needs to come out.</v>

661
00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:39.950
<v Speaker 14>We need to clear it.</v>
<v Speaker 14>It needs to be expressed.</v>

662
00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:43.040
<v Speaker 14>It needs to be acknowledged.</v>
<v Speaker 14>On the other hand,</v>

663
00:37:43.490 --> 00:37:44.323
<v Speaker 14>it's not enough.</v>
<v Speaker 14>This is only like this is breaking the </v>

664
00:37:47.211 --> 00:37:51.620
<v Speaker 14>ice so that the next step of evolution </v>
<v Speaker 14>can,</v>

665
00:37:51.830 --> 00:37:54.830
<v Speaker 14>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 14>consciousness can start coming through.</v>

666
00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:55.873
<v Speaker 14>And that's what I'm lacking in women.</v>
<v Speaker 14>It's really to take responsibility for </v>

667
00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:05.000
<v Speaker 14>what we do as women in our manipulation,</v>
<v Speaker 14>in our seduction,</v>

668
00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:07.340
<v Speaker 14>in our control.</v>
<v Speaker 14>And,</v>

669
00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:08.233
<v Speaker 14>and it's so easy for women to say,</v>
<v Speaker 14>but that's just because we're angry and </v>

670
00:38:12.231 --> 00:38:14.960
<v Speaker 14>mandate this and patriarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 14>but it's,</v>

671
00:38:14.961 --> 00:38:15.794
<v Speaker 14>um,</v>
<v Speaker 14>it's such a lack of responsibility and </v>

672
00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:20.150
<v Speaker 14>this women really need to know.</v>

673
00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:21.393
<v Speaker 12>I mean that's the kind of shadow work is</v>
<v Speaker 12>the acceptance that we all have shadows </v>

674
00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:29.020
<v Speaker 12>that men certainly have a shadow.</v>
<v Speaker 12>There was a shadow around masculinity,</v>

675
00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:31.780
<v Speaker 12>but there's also a shadow around </v>
<v Speaker 12>femininity.</v>

676
00:38:32.170 --> 00:38:33.003
<v Speaker 12>And while part of the cultural now is </v>
<v Speaker 12>toxic masculinity and everyone knows </v>

677
00:38:37.961 --> 00:38:40.000
<v Speaker 12>what you mean by toxic toxic </v>
<v Speaker 12>masculinity.</v>

678
00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:45.250
<v Speaker 12>If you talk about toxic femininity,</v>
<v Speaker 12>everyone still knows what you mean,</v>

679
00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:47.180
<v Speaker 12>but you can't have that conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Yeah.</v>

680
00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:48.700
<v Speaker 12>Which is,</v>
<v Speaker 12>it's,</v>

681
00:38:48.701 --> 00:38:49.534
<v Speaker 12>it's interesting what is allowed to be </v>
<v Speaker 12>said and what is not allowed to be said </v>

682
00:38:52.450 --> 00:38:53.470
<v Speaker 12>at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 12>And that,</v>

683
00:38:53.830 --> 00:38:58.830
<v Speaker 12>that I think is,</v>
<v Speaker 12>is very dangerous that certain topics,</v>

684
00:39:00.730 --> 00:39:03.310
<v Speaker 12>certain conversations or off or off </v>
<v Speaker 12>limits.</v>

685
00:39:03.311 --> 00:39:03.650
<v Speaker 12>Yeah.</v>

686
00:39:03.650 --> 00:39:06.710
<v Speaker 14>And this is where we see where,</v>
<v Speaker 14>where we see the victim,</v>

687
00:39:06.711 --> 00:39:07.544
<v Speaker 14>persecutor dynamics activates it because</v>
<v Speaker 14>women become the become the victims and </v>

688
00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:15.800
<v Speaker 14>we make ourselves the victims and we </v>
<v Speaker 14>persecute men.</v>

689
00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:18.290
<v Speaker 14>But in that aggression,</v>
<v Speaker 14>in that rage,</v>

690
00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:21.680
<v Speaker 14>and when we are the victims,</v>
<v Speaker 14>we are in perfect control.</v>

691
00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:27.100
<v Speaker 14>We become the persecutors because we say</v>
<v Speaker 14>it's all about blame.</v>

692
00:39:28.350 --> 00:39:31.370
<v Speaker 14>Did this and men need to take </v>
<v Speaker 14>responsibility.</v>

693
00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:34.100
<v Speaker 14>But in that we've become the </v>
<v Speaker 14>persecutors.</v>

694
00:39:34.170 --> 00:39:34.320
<v Speaker 14>Yeah.</v>

695
00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:39.320
<v Speaker 12>And it's also very difficult as well </v>
<v Speaker 12>because one imagines that that combative</v>

696
00:39:40.051 --> 00:39:42.870
<v Speaker 12>attitude is something that has served </v>
<v Speaker 12>her well in the past.</v>

697
00:39:42.871 --> 00:39:46.650
<v Speaker 12>And it's something that she's maybe felt</v>
<v Speaker 12>forced into because of the nature of the</v>

698
00:39:46.651 --> 00:39:50.400
<v Speaker 12>society that he's operating it.</v>
<v Speaker 12>So it's a kind of catch 22 situation for</v>

699
00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:51.473
<v Speaker 12>the many successful women because they </v>
<v Speaker 12>feel that they're pushed to be more </v>

700
00:39:54.091 --> 00:39:54.924
<v Speaker 12>masculine.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Yeah.</v>

701
00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:56.153
<v Speaker 12>And then when they're more masculine,</v>
<v Speaker 12>they get judged for being more </v>

702
00:39:59.821 --> 00:40:00.654
<v Speaker 12>masculine.</v>

703
00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:02.700
<v Speaker 14>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 14>it's very sad.</v>

704
00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:03.671
<v Speaker 14>And,</v>
<v Speaker 14>and,</v>

705
00:40:03.671 --> 00:40:05.760
<v Speaker 14>and I can see that dynamics being played</v>
<v Speaker 14>out.</v>

706
00:40:05.850 --> 00:40:06.683
<v Speaker 14>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 14>But I think the only thing we can do is </v>

707
00:40:09.451 --> 00:40:11.580
<v Speaker 14>to take responsibility and say,</v>
<v Speaker 14>okay,</v>

708
00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:12.773
<v Speaker 14>I'm doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 14>Do I really want to compromise my </v>

709
00:40:15.061 --> 00:40:18.720
<v Speaker 14>femininity?</v>
<v Speaker 14>Do I want to compromise my integrity?</v>

710
00:40:19.170 --> 00:40:24.150
<v Speaker 14>Do I want to compromise my gender and </v>
<v Speaker 14>play that or is there another way that I</v>

711
00:40:24.151 --> 00:40:26.730
<v Speaker 14>can be powerful without being </v>
<v Speaker 14>aggressive,</v>

712
00:40:26.731 --> 00:40:30.930
<v Speaker 14>without playing a power game,</v>
<v Speaker 14>but resting in my natural power,</v>

713
00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:32.153
<v Speaker 14>resting in my natural dignity,</v>
<v Speaker 14>resting in that deep rootedness that we </v>

714
00:40:36.061 --> 00:40:36.894
<v Speaker 14>both have in our agendas that when we </v>
<v Speaker 14>are at peace with it and when we </v>

715
00:40:41.071 --> 00:40:45.730
<v Speaker 14>acknowledge it in ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 14>it's that as a natural thing,</v>

716
00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:48.180
<v Speaker 14>and this is the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 14>I don't want to make this personal about</v>

717
00:40:48.181 --> 00:40:49.014
<v Speaker 14>Katherine Newman because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 14>it's in that potential is in every </v>

718
00:40:51.541 --> 00:40:52.374
<v Speaker 14>woman,</v>
<v Speaker 14>but it's because we are persecuting our </v>

719
00:40:54.690 --> 00:40:55.523
<v Speaker 14>own femininity.</v>
<v Speaker 14>What's being played out that we are </v>

720
00:40:57.571 --> 00:40:58.404
<v Speaker 14>doing it to ourselves because we don't </v>
<v Speaker 14>trust that it's good enough to be a </v>

721
00:41:00.991 --> 00:41:01.824
<v Speaker 14>woman.</v>
<v Speaker 14>We don't trust that we can have </v>

722
00:41:02.821 --> 00:41:06.480
<v Speaker 14>conversations that come from the felt </v>
<v Speaker 14>embodied perspective.</v>

723
00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:10.320
<v Speaker 14>We don't trust that we're connected to </v>
<v Speaker 14>truth because these,</v>

724
00:41:10.530 --> 00:41:11.363
<v Speaker 14>these masculine ways have been,</v>
<v Speaker 14>have been very strong and women have </v>

725
00:41:15.541 --> 00:41:17.040
<v Speaker 14>been denying their own power.</v>

726
00:41:17.370 --> 00:41:20.280
<v Speaker 15>In my work over many years of working </v>
<v Speaker 15>with this,</v>

727
00:41:20.610 --> 00:41:25.610
<v Speaker 15>I find that very few women grew up in </v>
<v Speaker 15>households which really loved,</v>

728
00:41:27.241 --> 00:41:29.460
<v Speaker 15>admired,</v>
<v Speaker 15>respected on or heard,</v>

729
00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:34.670
<v Speaker 15>cherished the feminine.</v>
<v Speaker 15>And so there is for so many of the women</v>

730
00:41:35.871 --> 00:41:38.180
<v Speaker 15>who've grown up in the,</v>
<v Speaker 15>I dunno,</v>

731
00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:40.550
<v Speaker 15>the last hundred years that say,</v>
<v Speaker 15>um,</v>

732
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.700
<v Speaker 15>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 15>kind of devaluation of the feminine that</v>

733
00:41:43.701 --> 00:41:47.300
<v Speaker 15>gets taken on and of course,</v>
<v Speaker 15>and as well as abuse,</v>

734
00:41:47.330 --> 00:41:48.980
<v Speaker 15>aggression,</v>
<v Speaker 15>all sorts of things.</v>

735
00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:54.280
<v Speaker 15>So very many women out of an intelligent</v>
<v Speaker 15>strategy to survive,</v>

736
00:41:55.310 --> 00:41:59.630
<v Speaker 15>develop their masculine side as a </v>
<v Speaker 15>defense against that devaluation for the</v>

737
00:41:59.631 --> 00:42:00.464
<v Speaker 15>feminine.</v>
<v Speaker 15>And over time they become very </v>

738
00:42:01.851 --> 00:42:02.684
<v Speaker 15>identified with that mask on side.</v>
<v Speaker 15>The male equivalent is anima possession </v>

739
00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:08.083
<v Speaker 15>in Anima possession.</v>
<v Speaker 15>It's the loss of relaxed confidence in </v>

740
00:42:12.801 --> 00:42:13.634
<v Speaker 15>the groundedness in the masculine and is</v>
<v Speaker 15>overwhelmed by his own inner feminine </v>

741
00:42:18.441 --> 00:42:21.680
<v Speaker 15>side.</v>
<v Speaker 15>And it creates a passive withdrawn,</v>

742
00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:24.290
<v Speaker 15>moody,</v>
<v Speaker 15>Bitchy,</v>

743
00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:29.630
<v Speaker 15>complaining,</v>
<v Speaker 15>not showing up kind of guy,</v>

744
00:42:29.631 --> 00:42:33.830
<v Speaker 15>which I think is really so much what </v>
<v Speaker 15>feminists are angry about.</v>

745
00:42:33.890 --> 00:42:37.640
<v Speaker 15>The don't see them as really angry about</v>
<v Speaker 15>the masculine per se,</v>

746
00:42:37.641 --> 00:42:41.250
<v Speaker 15>but the way that males behave.</v>
<v Speaker 15>And you know,</v>

747
00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:42.103
<v Speaker 15>I have quite a lot of compassion for </v>
<v Speaker 15>that because for myself and most men </v>

748
00:42:45.681 --> 00:42:46.514
<v Speaker 15>that I know,</v>
<v Speaker 15>we weren't really shown how to be as </v>

749
00:42:48.891 --> 00:42:51.860
<v Speaker 15>men.</v>
<v Speaker 15>We didn't really get initiated into it.</v>

750
00:42:51.861 --> 00:42:52.694
<v Speaker 15>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 15>and then the strong thing comes from </v>

751
00:42:54.681 --> 00:42:58.880
<v Speaker 15>feminism and we feel like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 15>it's maleness that's wrong.</v>

752
00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:02.270
<v Speaker 15>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 15>it's not maleness that's wrong.</v>

753
00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:06.800
<v Speaker 15>And I don't even think feminists,</v>
<v Speaker 15>feminists hate the masculine.</v>

754
00:43:07.370 --> 00:43:08.203
<v Speaker 15>It's like what the call is really for </v>
<v Speaker 15>men is to develop their masculine </v>

755
00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:14.150
<v Speaker 15>strength,</v>
<v Speaker 15>presence,</v>

756
00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:17.210
<v Speaker 15>courage,</v>
<v Speaker 15>be relaxed and confident,</v>

757
00:43:17.211 --> 00:43:22.211
<v Speaker 15>be protective and be strong.</v>
<v Speaker 15>And under this kind of assault,</v>

758
00:43:22.461 --> 00:43:25.340
<v Speaker 15>which has come from a lot of animals,</v>
<v Speaker 15>possessed women,</v>

759
00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:26.303
<v Speaker 15>a lot of men have retreated.</v>
<v Speaker 15>And I think gone into feeling guilty </v>

760
00:43:29.361 --> 00:43:34.361
<v Speaker 15>about being men and have become passive </v>
<v Speaker 15>indecisive.</v>

761
00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:35.653
<v Speaker 15>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 15>and in that way a kind of feminized man </v>

762
00:43:39.801 --> 00:43:40.790
<v Speaker 15>has emerged.</v>

763
00:43:42.030 --> 00:43:42.863
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

764
00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:45.983
<v Speaker 1>Lacy's follow eight pieces and store </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognize his analysis goes all the way </v>

765
00:43:49.571 --> 00:43:50.404
<v Speaker 1>down to the bedrock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the archetypal structures of </v>

766
00:43:53.051 --> 00:43:54.250
<v Speaker 1>consciousness itself.</v>

767
00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:57.570
<v Speaker 4>The thing that I really see happening,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you can tell me what you think about</v>

768
00:43:57.571 --> 00:44:01.890
<v Speaker 4>this in Norman's book consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is masculine,</v>

769
00:44:01.891 --> 00:44:04.230
<v Speaker 4>symbolically masculine for a variety of </v>
<v Speaker 4>reasons,</v>

770
00:44:04.231 --> 00:44:05.064
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is viewed as rising up against the </v>

771
00:44:08.431 --> 00:44:12.180
<v Speaker 4>countervailing force of tragedy from an </v>
<v Speaker 4>underlying co feminine,</v>

772
00:44:12.181 --> 00:44:14.370
<v Speaker 4>Symbolically Feminine unconsciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

773
00:44:14.371 --> 00:44:17.550
<v Speaker 4>And it's something that can always be </v>
<v Speaker 4>pulled back into that unconsciousness.</v>

774
00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:18.533
<v Speaker 4>That would be the microcosm of that </v>
<v Speaker 4>would be the Friday and eatable mother </v>

775
00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:22.853
<v Speaker 4>familial dynamic where the mother was so</v>
<v Speaker 4>over protective and all encompassing </v>

776
00:44:27.421 --> 00:44:29.790
<v Speaker 4>that she interferes with the development</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the competence,</v>

777
00:44:29.850 --> 00:44:30.683
<v Speaker 4>not only of her sons,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but over daughters of her children in </v>

778
00:44:32.611 --> 00:44:33.444
<v Speaker 4>general.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it seems to me that that's the </v>

779
00:44:35.071 --> 00:44:35.904
<v Speaker 4>dynamic that's being played out in our </v>
<v Speaker 4>society right now is that there's this </v>

780
00:44:39.090 --> 00:44:39.923
<v Speaker 4>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's related in some way that I don't </v>

781
00:44:41.071 --> 00:44:41.904
<v Speaker 4>understand to this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to this insistence that all forms of </v>

782
00:44:44.221 --> 00:44:47.010
<v Speaker 4>masculine and authority or nothing by </v>
<v Speaker 4>tyrannical power.</v>

783
00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:47.843
<v Speaker 4>So the symbolic representation is </v>
<v Speaker 4>tyrannical father with no appreciation </v>

784
00:44:53.281 --> 00:44:54.114
<v Speaker 4>for the benevolent father and benevolent</v>
<v Speaker 4>mother with no appreciation whatsoever </v>

785
00:44:58.021 --> 00:44:59.700
<v Speaker 4>for the tyrannical mother.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

786
00:44:59.701 --> 00:45:03.900
<v Speaker 4>And that's that cause I thought of </v>
<v Speaker 4>videology is as fragmentary mythologies.</v>

787
00:45:03.930 --> 00:45:07.020
<v Speaker 4>That's where they get their archetype in</v>
<v Speaker 4>psychological power,</v>

788
00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:09.360
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so in a balanced representation,</v>

789
00:45:09.361 --> 00:45:13.620
<v Speaker 4>you have the terrible mother and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>great mother as as noise and laid out so</v>

790
00:45:13.621 --> 00:45:16.750
<v Speaker 4>nicely and you have the terrible father </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the great father.</v>

791
00:45:16.751 --> 00:45:19.800
<v Speaker 4>So that's the fact that culture mangles </v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to death well.</v>

792
00:45:19.801 --> 00:45:21.870
<v Speaker 4>It's also promoting you and developing </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

793
00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:22.863
<v Speaker 4>You have to see that as balanced.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you have the heroic and </v>

794
00:45:24.811 --> 00:45:28.140
<v Speaker 4>adversarial individual.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But in the postmodern world,</v>

795
00:45:28.290 --> 00:45:29.123
<v Speaker 4>and this seems to be something that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>increasingly seeping out into the </v>

796
00:45:31.801 --> 00:45:32.634
<v Speaker 4>culture at large,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have nothing but the tyrannical </v>

797
00:45:34.381 --> 00:45:35.214
<v Speaker 4>father.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nothing but the destructive force of </v>

798
00:45:37.351 --> 00:45:40.650
<v Speaker 4>masculine consciousness and nothing but </v>
<v Speaker 4>the benevolent,</v>

799
00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:42.480
<v Speaker 4>benevolent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>great mother.</v>

800
00:45:42.481 --> 00:45:44.400
<v Speaker 4>And it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's an appalling ideology.</v>

801
00:45:44.401 --> 00:45:47.430
<v Speaker 4>And it seems to me that it's sucking the</v>
<v Speaker 4>vitality,</v>

802
00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:48.413
<v Speaker 4>which,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is exactly what you would expect </v>

803
00:45:49.441 --> 00:45:50.274
<v Speaker 4>symbolically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's sucking the vitality of our </v>

804
00:45:51.571 --> 00:45:52.404
<v Speaker 4>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see that with the increasing </v>

805
00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:56.970
<v Speaker 4>demolition of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of young men,</v>

806
00:45:57.390 --> 00:45:59.670
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and not only young men in terms of their</v>

807
00:45:59.671 --> 00:46:02.430
<v Speaker 4>academic performance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which like they're falling way behind in</v>

808
00:46:02.431 --> 00:46:05.910
<v Speaker 4>elementary school way behind in junior </v>
<v Speaker 4>high and bailing out of the universities</v>

809
00:46:05.911 --> 00:46:07.680
<v Speaker 4>like mad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

810
00:46:07.890 --> 00:46:08.680
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>

811
00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:12.460
<v Speaker 16>well the public school education has </v>
<v Speaker 16>become completely permeated by this kind</v>

812
00:46:12.461 --> 00:46:14.630
<v Speaker 16>of anti male propaganda.</v>
<v Speaker 16>I mean,</v>

813
00:46:14.631 --> 00:46:17.380
<v Speaker 16>and to me public schools I just a form </v>
<v Speaker 16>of imprisonment,</v>

814
00:46:17.410 --> 00:46:18.243
<v Speaker 16>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 16>right now they are particularly </v>

815
00:46:19.061 --> 00:46:22.610
<v Speaker 16>destructive to young men who have a lot </v>
<v Speaker 16>of physical energy right now.</v>

816
00:46:22.750 --> 00:46:24.400
<v Speaker 16>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 16>I identify as transgender,</v>

817
00:46:24.430 --> 00:46:25.690
<v Speaker 16>Gay Mike Myself,</v>
<v Speaker 16>right?</v>

818
00:46:25.691 --> 00:46:26.524
<v Speaker 16>But I do not,</v>
<v Speaker 16>I do not require the entire world to </v>

819
00:46:29.981 --> 00:46:31.320
<v Speaker 16>alter itself okay.</v>
<v Speaker 16>To,</v>

820
00:46:31.321 --> 00:46:36.321
<v Speaker 16>to fit my particular in the self image.</v>
<v Speaker 16>I do believe in the power of hormones.</v>

821
00:46:36.341 --> 00:46:40.780
<v Speaker 16>I believe that men exist and women exist</v>
<v Speaker 16>and are biologically different.</v>

822
00:46:40.990 --> 00:46:44.360
<v Speaker 16>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 16>I think there is no cure for,</v>

823
00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:45.213
<v Speaker 16>I'm the cultures ills right now except </v>
<v Speaker 16>if men start standing up away and </v>

824
00:46:49.241 --> 00:46:51.820
<v Speaker 16>demanding that they be respected as men.</v>

825
00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.680
<v Speaker 4>Here's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

826
00:46:54.190 --> 00:46:56.170
<v Speaker 4>this is something my wife has pointed </v>
<v Speaker 4>out to.</v>

827
00:46:56.171 --> 00:46:56.741
<v Speaker 4>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

828
00:46:56.741 --> 00:46:58.570
<v Speaker 4>men are going to have to stand up for </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves.</v>

829
00:46:58.571 --> 00:47:02.680
<v Speaker 4>But here's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know how to stand up to a man who's,</v>

830
00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:03.933
<v Speaker 4>who's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

831
00:47:04.030 --> 00:47:04.863
<v Speaker 4>unfairly trespassed against me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the reason I know that is because </v>

832
00:47:08.530 --> 00:47:11.440
<v Speaker 4>the parameters for my resistance are </v>
<v Speaker 4>quite well defined,</v>

833
00:47:11.650 --> 00:47:14.050
<v Speaker 4>which is we talk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we argue,</v>

834
00:47:14.410 --> 00:47:16.870
<v Speaker 4>we push,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then it becomes physical,</v>

835
00:47:17.260 --> 00:47:17.921
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if,</v>

836
00:47:17.921 --> 00:47:21.010
<v Speaker 4>if we move beyond the boundaries of </v>
<v Speaker 4>civil discourse,</v>

837
00:47:21.070 --> 00:47:22.990
<v Speaker 4>we know what the next step is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

838
00:47:22.991 --> 00:47:26.130
<v Speaker 4>That's forbidden in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in discourse with women.</v>

839
00:47:26.350 --> 00:47:27.183
<v Speaker 4>So I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it seems to me that it isn't men </v>

840
00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:31.750
<v Speaker 4>that have to stand up and say enough of </v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

841
00:47:31.751 --> 00:47:32.584
<v Speaker 4>even though that is what they should do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seems to me that it's same women who </v>

842
00:47:35.681 --> 00:47:38.590
<v Speaker 4>have to stand up against their crazy </v>
<v Speaker 4>sisters and say,</v>

843
00:47:38.591 --> 00:47:39.424
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>enough of that enough man hating enough </v>

844
00:47:41.261 --> 00:47:44.920
<v Speaker 4>pathology,</v>
<v Speaker 4>enough bringing disgrace on us as a,</v>

845
00:47:45.010 --> 00:47:46.030
<v Speaker 4>as a gender.</v>

846
00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:50.020
<v Speaker 4>But the problem there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then I'll start my little tirade,</v>

847
00:47:50.021 --> 00:47:54.910
<v Speaker 4>is that most of the women I know who are</v>
<v Speaker 4>sane are busy doing same things,</v>

848
00:47:54.911 --> 00:47:55.680
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're off.</v>

849
00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:57.400
<v Speaker 4>They have their career,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have their family,</v>

850
00:47:57.401 --> 00:47:58.234
<v Speaker 4>they're quite occupied and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>seem to have the time or maybe even the </v>

851
00:48:00.971 --> 00:48:04.600
<v Speaker 4>interest to go after there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're crazy heartbeat sisters.</v>

852
00:48:04.601 --> 00:48:07.090
<v Speaker 4>And so I don't see any regulating force </v>
<v Speaker 4>for that,</v>

853
00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:08.103
<v Speaker 4>that terrible femininity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it seems to me to be invading the </v>

854
00:48:12.161 --> 00:48:17.140
<v Speaker 4>culture and undermining the masculine </v>
<v Speaker 4>power of the culture in a way that's,</v>

855
00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:19.060
<v Speaker 4>I think fatal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really do believe that.</v>

856
00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:20.840
<v Speaker 16>I too,</v>
<v Speaker 16>I too believe that these are,</v>

857
00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:23.960
<v Speaker 16>this is symptomatic of the decline of </v>
<v Speaker 16>Western culture and,</v>

858
00:48:23.961 --> 00:48:24.460
<v Speaker 16>and we,</v>
<v Speaker 16>and,</v>

859
00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:27.730
<v Speaker 16>and it will just go down flat.</v>
<v Speaker 16>I don't think people realize that,</v>

860
00:48:27.731 --> 00:48:31.270
<v Speaker 16>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 16>masculinity is still exists in the world</v>

861
00:48:31.271 --> 00:48:33.970
<v Speaker 16>as a code among jihadists.</v>
<v Speaker 16>Okay.</v>

862
00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:36.490
<v Speaker 16>And when you have passionate </v>
<v Speaker 16>masculinity,</v>

863
00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:38.400
<v Speaker 16>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 16>Circling the borders,</v>

864
00:48:38.401 --> 00:48:40.690
<v Speaker 16>like the huns in the vandals during the </v>
<v Speaker 16>Roman empire,</v>

865
00:48:40.691 --> 00:48:41.560
<v Speaker 16>that,</v>
<v Speaker 16>that's what I see.</v>

866
00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:44.170
<v Speaker 16>I see this culture rotting from within.</v>
<v Speaker 16>Okay.</v>

867
00:48:44.171 --> 00:48:45.880
<v Speaker 16>And,</v>
<v Speaker 16>and this all link itself,</v>

868
00:48:45.881 --> 00:48:46.714
<v Speaker 16>literally,</v>

869
00:48:53.710 --> 00:48:58.710
<v Speaker 5>we have this bit of combat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's say it produced a scandal.</v>

870
00:49:00.190 --> 00:49:02.380
<v Speaker 5>Now we actually talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

871
00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:03.273
<v Speaker 5>No tricks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just to conversation and then everybody </v>

872
00:49:05.861 --> 00:49:06.940
<v Speaker 5>wins.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

873
00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:10.000
<v Speaker 5>Because I can admit whatever mistakes I </v>
<v Speaker 5>made,</v>

874
00:49:10.420 --> 00:49:12.520
<v Speaker 5>she can admit whatever mistakes she </v>
<v Speaker 5>made,</v>

875
00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:13.623
<v Speaker 5>we can drop the persona.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you're saying the polarization that </v>

876
00:49:16.211 --> 00:49:19.330
<v Speaker 5>we're seeing right now that we are </v>
<v Speaker 5>speaking out,</v>

877
00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:20.733
<v Speaker 5>it's not in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We will x out that polarization if we </v>

878
00:49:24.281 --> 00:49:25.114
<v Speaker 5>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if we keep accelerating and especially </v>

879
00:49:26.591 --> 00:49:28.930
<v Speaker 5>if we keep accelerating it with lies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

880
00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:29.431
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

881
00:49:29.431 --> 00:49:31.210
<v Speaker 5>and this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this whole,</v>

882
00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:35.080
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>channel four rats,</v>

883
00:49:35.081 --> 00:49:38.120
<v Speaker 5>nest is like 90% lies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

884
00:49:38.170 --> 00:49:39.430
<v Speaker 5>Maybe more.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

885
00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:40.211
<v Speaker 5>And I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

886
00:49:40.211 --> 00:49:42.280
<v Speaker 5>a lot of it's ideologically motivated </v>
<v Speaker 5>lies,</v>

887
00:49:42.281 --> 00:49:44.650
<v Speaker 5>but it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's still lies.</v>

888
00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:46.930
<v Speaker 5>Like Kathy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as I said,</v>

889
00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:49.233
<v Speaker 5>there was virtually nothing she said in </v>
<v Speaker 5>that interview that was actually coming </v>

890
00:49:53.711 --> 00:49:55.090
<v Speaker 5>from her,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

891
00:49:55.150 --> 00:49:58.110
<v Speaker 5>like a deep part of her soul,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of her persona.</v>

892
00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:00.730
<v Speaker 5>It was all persona.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was all persona and,</v>

893
00:50:00.731 --> 00:50:03.970
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and all use of words in a,</v>

894
00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:07.300
<v Speaker 5>in a expedient manner as tools to </v>
<v Speaker 5>obtain.</v>

895
00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:12.330
<v Speaker 5>I think probably probably status,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dominance,</v>

896
00:50:12.331 --> 00:50:14.500
<v Speaker 5>status and reputation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

897
00:50:14.610 --> 00:50:17.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean what advice would you give to </v>
<v Speaker 2>people too,</v>

898
00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:21.080
<v Speaker 2>to navigate this new world?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first is a free your mind.</v>

899
00:50:21.470 --> 00:50:26.440
<v Speaker 2>Be Aware of the fact that the habits of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Blue Church and and how it works,</v>

900
00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:28.580
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't work anymore.</v>

901
00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:29.473
<v Speaker 2>Recognize that your way of making sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the world that used to work don't </v>

902
00:50:32.121 --> 00:50:32.954
<v Speaker 2>work and you really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really need to set yourself free to </v>

903
00:50:34.521 --> 00:50:38.090
<v Speaker 2>begin learning a new child's mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beginner's mind.</v>

904
00:50:39.130 --> 00:50:39.963
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>second,</v>

905
00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:41.503
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this by nature must in fact be </v>

906
00:50:43.551 --> 00:50:48.551
<v Speaker 2>exploratory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So swim do not make sense prematurely in</v>

907
00:50:49.461 --> 00:50:50.294
<v Speaker 2>spite of the fact that the world feels </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous instead of the five that you </v>

908
00:50:52.551 --> 00:50:57.551
<v Speaker 2>may want to protect yourself in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous world I'm doing.</v>

909
00:51:00.141 --> 00:51:02.120
<v Speaker 2>So to quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

910
00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:07.240
<v Speaker 2>does not allow the natural exploratory</v>
<v Speaker 2>approach to do what it needs to do.</v>

911
00:51:09.590 --> 00:51:10.423
<v Speaker 2>Really just listen and learn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go all the way that back down to human </v>

912
00:51:14.811 --> 00:51:16.670
<v Speaker 2>base.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Turn it inward.</v>

913
00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:22.600
<v Speaker 2>Learn how fear shows up in you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Learn how not to allow fear to drive the</v>

914
00:51:23.181 --> 00:51:24.014
<v Speaker 2>choices that you make.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Learn how to listen to the whole way </v>

915
00:51:27.561 --> 00:51:29.510
<v Speaker 2>that all of you perceives what's going </v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

916
00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:31.550
<v Speaker 2>Become more integrated with your own </v>
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>

917
00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:36.470
<v Speaker 2>Go out into nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spend a lot of time not connected to the</v>

918
00:51:36.471 --> 00:51:37.304
<v Speaker 2>chaos that's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of time reconnecting yourself </v>

919
00:51:40.431 --> 00:51:41.264
<v Speaker 2>with your fundamental capacity to </v>
<v Speaker 2>perceive reality in all the different </v>

920
00:51:44.211 --> 00:51:46.610
<v Speaker 2>modalities that human beings have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>capacity to do.</v>

921
00:51:48.890 --> 00:51:53.450
<v Speaker 2>Then relearn how to use other human </v>
<v Speaker 2>beings as allies and figuring out how to</v>

922
00:51:53.451 --> 00:51:54.284
<v Speaker 2>make sense of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that really relearn like we have </v>

923
00:51:57.980 --> 00:51:58.813
<v Speaker 2>been abused and a constrained by </v>
<v Speaker 2>institutional frameworks that remove us </v>

924
00:52:04.941 --> 00:52:07.880
<v Speaker 2>from our own native capabilities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So relearn that,</v>

925
00:52:07.940 --> 00:52:09.740
<v Speaker 2>understand how to be a friend and an </v>
<v Speaker 2>ally,</v>

926
00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:13.910
<v Speaker 2>how to have a conversation with somebody</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you're really listening closely to</v>

927
00:52:13.911 --> 00:52:16.580
<v Speaker 2>get a sense of what their perspective </v>
<v Speaker 2>brings to you,</v>

928
00:52:17.210 --> 00:52:19.220
<v Speaker 2>where you're not obligated to agree with</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

929
00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:23.870
<v Speaker 2>We are not obligated to move out of what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you feel is right to form some new,</v>

930
00:52:24.220 --> 00:52:25.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>consensus,</v>

931
00:52:25.101 --> 00:52:25.934
<v Speaker 2>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But where you're actually authentically </v>

932
00:52:27.830 --> 00:52:28.663
<v Speaker 2>recognizing that their perspective has </v>
<v Speaker 2>some capacity to bring richness to your </v>

933
00:52:31.911 --> 00:52:34.220
<v Speaker 2>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just by the way,</v>

934
00:52:34.221 --> 00:52:36.890
<v Speaker 2>is almost exclusively possible in </v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

935
00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:39.920
<v Speaker 2>And what we're doing right now is an o </v>
<v Speaker 2>cavers and epic need.</v>

936
00:52:39.930 --> 00:52:40.763
<v Speaker 2>We'd be very mindful of the fact that a </v>
<v Speaker 2>linear broadcast is bad and even </v>

937
00:52:45.620 --> 00:52:49.370
<v Speaker 2>interactive bandwidth like this is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>good enough.</v>

938
00:52:49.620 --> 00:52:50.453
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to learn from raw physical </v>

939
00:52:53.450 --> 00:52:54.283
<v Speaker 2>and get yourself into places where your </v>
<v Speaker 2>consensus reality and your habits are </v>

940
00:52:57.200 --> 00:53:00.110
<v Speaker 2>willfully destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It to human,</v>

941
00:53:00.111 --> 00:53:04.250
<v Speaker 2>to human conversations and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and get as far with ideology as you can.</v>

942
00:53:05.210 --> 00:53:07.460
<v Speaker 2>Your job is not to know what the fuck is</v>
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>

943
00:53:07.970 --> 00:53:08.803
<v Speaker 2>Your job has to be absolutely certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you have no idea what the fuck is </v>

944
00:53:10.761 --> 00:53:14.390
<v Speaker 2>going on and learn how to feel from raw </v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos,</v>

945
00:53:14.391 --> 00:53:19.130
<v Speaker 2>from raw uncertainty up</v>
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>

946
00:53:19.610 --> 00:53:20.443
<v Speaker 2>and only then are you finally able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>begin the journey of beginning form a </v>

947
00:53:25.381 --> 00:53:27.240
<v Speaker 2>collective intelligence in this new </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment.</v>

948
00:53:28.110 --> 00:53:28.943
<v Speaker 2>That's my advice.</v>

949
