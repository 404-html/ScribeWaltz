00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.170
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good evening,</v>

2
00:00:24.171 --> 00:00:29.171
<v Speaker 1>London,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two weeks ago,</v>

3
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.480
<v Speaker 1>Sam Harris and Jordan Peterson met in </v>
<v Speaker 1>person for the first time on stage in </v>

4
00:00:38.721 --> 00:00:43.721
<v Speaker 1>Vancouver two nights ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The three of us got together for the </v>

5
00:00:43.821 --> 00:00:48.821
<v Speaker 1>first time in Dublin and it's a huge </v>
<v Speaker 1>thrill for all of us to now be here with</v>

6
00:00:50.481 --> 00:00:55.481
<v Speaker 1>you in the o two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said to travis when these events </v>

7
00:01:05.521 --> 00:01:10.521
<v Speaker 1>were planned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not moderate enough to be a </v>

8
00:01:10.521 --> 00:01:10.521
<v Speaker 1>moderator,</v>

9
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.240
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to do a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fielding to begin with,</v>

10
00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.260
<v Speaker 1>so let me start by saying a little of </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the ground we are going to be </v>

11
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.020
<v Speaker 1>trying to cover here tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to be dealing with the </v>

12
00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:33.870
<v Speaker 1>conflict between science and reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to be addressing the </v>

13
00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.730
<v Speaker 1>legitimacy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did I say science and reason science and</v>

14
00:01:39.731 --> 00:01:40.080
<v Speaker 1>reason?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

15
00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.390
<v Speaker 1>Occasionally there is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not addressing that.</v>

16
00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.630
<v Speaker 1>We're going to be looking at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>legitimacy of holding onto religion in </v>

17
00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.760
<v Speaker 1>any form and we are also going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>addressing the fact that we need to hide</v>

18
00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.110
<v Speaker 1>in a sports stadium to address serious </v>
<v Speaker 1>issues.</v>

19
00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.370
<v Speaker 1>But I think to begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to hand over to Sam and he's </v>

20
00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.530
<v Speaker 1>going to kick us off.</v>

21
00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.630
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank you.</v>

22
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.440
<v Speaker 2>First,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank you all for coming out.</v>

23
00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.500
<v Speaker 2>I really can't imagine how humble</v>

24
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.450
<v Speaker 3>to be here with you.</v>

25
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.200
<v Speaker 2>You really should just take a moment to </v>
<v Speaker 2>appreciate this from our side because </v>

26
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.700
<v Speaker 2>Justin Bieber is not coming out to sing </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the middle of this as a museum is </v>

27
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.750
<v Speaker 2>that would be a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

28
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.190
<v Speaker 2>though we put the date like this on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>calendar with apparent confidence,</v>

29
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.490
<v Speaker 2>there's really no guarantee that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys are going to show up and we will </v>

30
00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.401
<v Speaker 2>never take this for granted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it is really an immense privilege to </v>

31
00:02:49.401 --> 00:02:49.401
<v Speaker 2>be here with you.</v>

32
00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:53.140
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

33
00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.330
<v Speaker 2>I thought I could start by first how fun</v>
<v Speaker 2>this has been to,</v>

34
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.760
<v Speaker 2>to have this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these series of dialogues,</v>

35
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:05.260
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with Jordan.</v>

36
00:03:05.261 --> 00:03:10.261
<v Speaker 2>Now this is the fourth event we've done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the second with Douglas and we </v>

37
00:03:11.861 --> 00:03:14.470
<v Speaker 2>clearly share a common project mean we </v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

38
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.530
<v Speaker 2>we are trying to figure out how to live </v>
<v Speaker 2>the best lives possible both </v>

39
00:03:20.231 --> 00:03:25.231
<v Speaker 2>individually and collectively and we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to figure out how to build </v>

40
00:03:25.231 --> 00:03:29.851
<v Speaker 2>societies that safeguard that </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity for as many people as </v>

41
00:03:29.851 --> 00:03:34.621
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think we each have a sense that </v>

42
00:03:34.621 --> 00:03:39.090
<v Speaker 2>ideas are really the prime movers here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's not that the world is filled </v>

43
00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.490
<v Speaker 2>with bad people doing bad things because</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what bad people do though there,</v>

44
00:03:43.491 --> 00:03:48.010
<v Speaker 2>there is some of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is mostly that so much of humanity is</v>

45
00:03:48.011 --> 00:03:53.011
<v Speaker 2>living under the sway of bad ideas and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's bad ideas that can cause good </v>

46
00:03:53.011 --> 00:03:57.811
<v Speaker 2>people or at least totally normal people</v>
<v Speaker 2>like ourselves to do bad things all the </v>

47
00:03:57.811 --> 00:04:01.270
<v Speaker 2>while trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to live the best possible lives.</v>

48
00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.510
<v Speaker 2>And that really is the tragedy of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>circumstance that we can be that </v>

49
00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:06.510
<v Speaker 2>confused.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

50
00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.370
<v Speaker 2>so this is where the difference between </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jordan and and me in particular opens </v>

51
00:04:13.571 --> 00:04:18.571
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is how do you view religion in </v>

52
00:04:18.571 --> 00:04:22.861
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this contest between good ideas and </v>

53
00:04:22.861 --> 00:04:22.861
<v Speaker 2>bad ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for me,</v>

54
00:04:22.861 --> 00:04:26.611
<v Speaker 2>religion emphatically gets placed on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>side of bad and old and a worth retiring</v>

55
00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.920
<v Speaker 2>ideas or ideas worth retiring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I guess by analogy I would,</v>

56
00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.250
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

57
00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.270
<v Speaker 2>ask you to consider astrology and I had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I can just get a sense of what I'm</v>

58
00:04:43.271 --> 00:04:47.290
<v Speaker 2>talking to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What percentage of you I want to know,</v>

59
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.040
<v Speaker 2>believe in astrology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is to say who among you.</v>

60
00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:55.840
<v Speaker 2>And you can signal this by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by applause or a house of enthusiasm.</v>

61
00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.050
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what percentage of your let,</v>

62
00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:03.090
<v Speaker 2>let me just spell it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know what you're committing to a </v>

63
00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:04.390
<v Speaker 2>and a new neural,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how crazy your neighbor is.</v>

64
00:05:04.391 --> 00:05:09.391
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what percentage of you believe that </v>

65
00:05:09.391 --> 00:05:13.570
<v Speaker 2>human personalities and human events and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the difference between good and bad luck</v>

66
00:05:13.571 --> 00:05:18.571
<v Speaker 2>in a human life is the result of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>the planets are doing against the </v>

67
00:05:18.571 --> 00:05:23.260
<v Speaker 2>background of stars or it somebody out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

68
00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:29.340
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now you should know that something </v>

69
00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:29.780
<v Speaker 2>like 25 percent of your neighbors </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe that.</v>

70
00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:31.530
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

71
00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:32.660
<v Speaker 2>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm,</v>

72
00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:35.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

73
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>

74
00:05:36.611 --> 00:05:37.020
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait.</v>

75
00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:42.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm hearing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm hearing a heckler among the </v>

76
00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.401
<v Speaker 2>astrologers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that for the first astrological </v>

77
00:05:44.401 --> 00:05:48.610
<v Speaker 2>heckler?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard you must be an areas or</v>

78
00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.110
<v Speaker 3>so it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it</v>

79
00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:00.380
<v Speaker 2>won't surprise you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a related question,</v>

80
00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:05.770
<v Speaker 2>which is what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What percentage of you I want to know </v>

81
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:08.810
<v Speaker 2>are religious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is say,</v>

82
00:06:08.811 --> 00:06:11.300
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who among you believe in God,</v>

83
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.940
<v Speaker 2>a personal God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a God that can hear prayers,</v>

84
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:19.330
<v Speaker 2>a god that can take an interest in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>lives of human beings and occasionally </v>

85
00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.760
<v Speaker 2>law enforce good outcomes versus bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>outcomes.</v>

86
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:24.590
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who among you?</v>

87
00:06:24.591 --> 00:06:26.540
<v Speaker 2>And now again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to hear applause or,</v>

88
00:06:26.541 --> 00:06:29.000
<v Speaker 2>or silence believing that sort of God.</v>

89
00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.870
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is my concern is my concern with</v>

90
00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:40.430
<v Speaker 2>what Jordan has been saying and writing </v>
<v Speaker 2>Lo these many months.</v>

91
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.770
<v Speaker 2>I feel that you are in danger of </v>
<v Speaker 2>misleading these,</v>

92
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:50.800
<v Speaker 2>the second group of people that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the way you talk about God has </v>

93
00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:55.031
<v Speaker 2>convinced and will continue to convince </v>
<v Speaker 2>some percentage of humanity that it's </v>

94
00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:00.760
<v Speaker 2>fine to hold on to this old sort of God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this God that can hear prayers and they </v>

95
00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.680
<v Speaker 2>can intervene or not in the lives of </v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings.</v>

96
00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:05.570
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

97
00:07:05.571 --> 00:07:08.840
<v Speaker 2>as we've begun to explore that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there are a lot of problems with</v>

98
00:07:08.841 --> 00:07:11.660
<v Speaker 2>that kind of belief.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

99
00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:16.780
<v Speaker 2>if nothing else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are many such God's on offer and </v>

100
00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:18.530
<v Speaker 2>their devotion to them becomes </v>
<v Speaker 2>irreconcilable among the true believers.</v>

101
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:24.320
<v Speaker 2>And my concern is that you could do </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly what you do with religion,</v>

102
00:07:24.321 --> 00:07:25.910
<v Speaker 2>with astrology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

103
00:07:25.911 --> 00:07:28.460
<v Speaker 2>It would be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be no more legitimate to,</v>

104
00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.710
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

105
00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:35.810
<v Speaker 2>obfuscate the boundary between clear </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking and superstition there because </v>

106
00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:42.550
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this traditional God and the and the </v>

107
00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:46.211
<v Speaker 2>doctrines that support him are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are no firmer ground than astrology is </v>

108
00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:47.900
<v Speaker 2>now today.</v>

109
00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:52.900
<v Speaker 2>And astrology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost everything you say about </v>

110
00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:56.171
<v Speaker 2>religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the fact that his organized human </v>

111
00:07:56.171 --> 00:08:00.461
<v Speaker 2>thinking for thousands of years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's a cultural universal that </v>

112
00:08:00.461 --> 00:08:01.460
<v Speaker 2>every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every group of people has,</v>

113
00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:06.200
<v Speaker 2>has given rise to some form of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That it has archetypal significance that</v>

114
00:08:06.201 --> 00:08:11.201
<v Speaker 2>has powerful stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of that can be said about astrology </v>

115
00:08:11.201 --> 00:08:11.201
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

116
00:08:11.201 --> 00:08:11.630
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in fact,</v>

117
00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:15.550
<v Speaker 2>some additional things can be said about</v>
<v Speaker 2>astrology that or are would argue in its</v>

118
00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.280
<v Speaker 2>favor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For instance,</v>

119
00:08:16.281 --> 00:08:20.000
<v Speaker 2>astrology is profoundly egalitarian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

120
00:08:20.001 --> 00:08:22.820
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no bad Zodiac sign every whoever</v>

121
00:08:22.821 --> 00:08:27.821
<v Speaker 2>you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's got a great Zodiac sign and </v>

122
00:08:27.821 --> 00:08:28.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

123
00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:33.180
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a inconvenient fact of the </v>

124
00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:33.710
<v Speaker 2>discipline that if I read you Charles </v>
<v Speaker 2>Manson's Horoscope,</v>

125
00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:37.230
<v Speaker 2>you'd have 95 percent of the audience </v>
<v Speaker 2>would find it relevant and,</v>

126
00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:42.570
<v Speaker 2>and that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how easily falsifiable astrology </v>

127
00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:46.481
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that my concern is that we could </v>

128
00:08:46.481 --> 00:08:49.130
<v Speaker 2>live in a world where societies are </v>
<v Speaker 2>shattered over things like,</v>

129
00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:54.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different Zodiac interpretations and we </v>

130
00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:57.881
<v Speaker 2>don't live in that world for good reason</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we have beaten astrology into </v>

131
00:08:57.881 --> 00:09:02.001
<v Speaker 2>submission.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would say that religion in terms </v>

132
00:09:02.001 --> 00:09:05.001
<v Speaker 2>of revealed religion and belief in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>personal God is over the centuries </v>

133
00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:08.730
<v Speaker 2>getting the same treatment by science </v>
<v Speaker 2>and rationality and should be.</v>

134
00:09:08.731 --> 00:09:13.731
<v Speaker 2>And it is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a perverse circumstance that we live in </v>

135
00:09:13.731 --> 00:09:13.731
<v Speaker 2>a world that is that a shattered by </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion.</v>

136
00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:27.240
<v Speaker 4>So I think what I'll do first is adopt </v>
<v Speaker 4>the exceptionally difficult and likely </v>

137
00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:34.510
<v Speaker 4>counterproductive position of saying </v>
<v Speaker 4>something not so much in defensive </v>

138
00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:37.360
<v Speaker 4>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but in defense of astrology,</v>

139
00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:43.080
<v Speaker 4>knowing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>knowing full well that that's </v>

140
00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:46.321
<v Speaker 4>fundamentally a fool's errand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there's something I want to point </v>

141
00:09:46.321 --> 00:09:49.100
<v Speaker 4>out is that first of all,</v>

142
00:09:55.310 --> 00:10:00.310
<v Speaker 4>astrology was astronomy in it's nascent </v>
<v Speaker 4>form and astrology was also science in </v>

143
00:10:02.691 --> 00:10:05.840
<v Speaker 4>its nascent form,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just like alchemy was chemistry and it's</v>

144
00:10:05.841 --> 00:10:10.841
<v Speaker 4>nascent form,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so sometimes you have to dream a </v>

145
00:10:11.061 --> 00:10:16.061
<v Speaker 4>crazy dream with all of the error that </v>
<v Speaker 4>that crazy dream entails because you </v>

146
00:10:17.541 --> 00:10:22.541
<v Speaker 4>have an intuition that there's something</v>
<v Speaker 4>there to motivate you to develop the </v>

147
00:10:22.541 --> 00:10:26.420
<v Speaker 4>intuition to the point where it actually</v>
<v Speaker 4>becomes a genuine practical utility.</v>

148
00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:30.980
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when we look back on the astrologers and</v>

149
00:10:30.981 --> 00:10:35.981
<v Speaker 4>we value their contributions to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>history of the world with contempt,</v>

150
00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:40.700
<v Speaker 4>we should also remember that the people </v>
<v Speaker 4>who built Stonehenge,</v>

151
00:10:40.701 --> 00:10:45.701
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the first people who decided </v>

152
00:10:45.701 --> 00:10:48.140
<v Speaker 4>determined that our fates were in part </v>
<v Speaker 4>written in the stars,</v>

153
00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:53.440
<v Speaker 4>were people whose astrological beliefs </v>
<v Speaker 4>were indistinguishable from their </v>

154
00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:55.790
<v Speaker 4>astronomical beliefs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you might think,</v>

155
00:10:55.791 --> 00:11:00.791
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in what sense is your fate written in </v>

156
00:11:00.791 --> 00:11:04.721
<v Speaker 4>the stars?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I would say it's certainly the case </v>

157
00:11:04.721 --> 00:11:07.550
<v Speaker 4>in so far as there are such things as </v>
<v Speaker 4>cosmic regularities.</v>

158
00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:13.210
<v Speaker 4>So it was the dream of astrology that </v>
<v Speaker 4>there was some relationship between the </v>

159
00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:17.630
<v Speaker 4>movement of the planetary bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the fixed stars and human destiny,</v>

160
00:11:17.631 --> 00:11:22.631
<v Speaker 4>and that's what drove us to build the </v>
<v Speaker 4>first astronomical observatories and to </v>

161
00:11:23.241 --> 00:11:28.241
<v Speaker 4>also determine that there was a proper </v>
<v Speaker 4>time for planting and a proper time for </v>

162
00:11:28.241 --> 00:11:30.530
<v Speaker 4>harvesting and a way of orienting </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself in the world.</v>

163
00:11:30.531 --> 00:11:32.660
<v Speaker 4>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by using the north star,</v>

164
00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:38.050
<v Speaker 4>it's also the poetic grounded enabled us</v>
<v Speaker 4>to identify the notion that you could </v>

165
00:11:38.751 --> 00:11:43.751
<v Speaker 4>look up and Orient Yourself towards the </v>
<v Speaker 4>heavens and that there was a </v>

166
00:11:43.751 --> 00:11:46.721
<v Speaker 4>metaphorical relationship between that </v>
<v Speaker 4>and positioning yourself properly in </v>

167
00:11:46.721 --> 00:11:49.320
<v Speaker 4>life and at a deeper level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

168
00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:52.760
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the cosmos was the place that the human,</v>

169
00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:58.120
<v Speaker 4>that the drama was externalized and </v>
<v Speaker 4>draped itself out into the world as </v>

170
00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:01.510
<v Speaker 4>something that was essentially </v>
<v Speaker 4>observable so that we could derive great</v>

171
00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:05.260
<v Speaker 4>orienting fictions from the observation </v>
<v Speaker 4>of our imagination.</v>

172
00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:09.550
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and part of the problem that that Sam is</v>

173
00:12:09.551 --> 00:12:14.551
<v Speaker 4>pointing to is the difficulty of </v>
<v Speaker 4>distinguishing valid poetic impulse from</v>

174
00:12:15.401 --> 00:12:18.910
<v Speaker 4>invalid political impulse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that really is a tremendous problem.</v>

175
00:12:18.911 --> 00:12:23.911
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you see that arise also in people who </v>

176
00:12:23.911 --> 00:12:26.580
<v Speaker 4>have religious delusions attendant upon </v>
<v Speaker 4>manic depressive disorder or </v>

177
00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:29.950
<v Speaker 4>schizophrenia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But so much of what eventually manifests</v>

178
00:12:29.951 --> 00:12:34.951
<v Speaker 4>itself as hardcore pragmatic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>scientific belief has its origin in wild</v>

179
00:12:34.991 --> 00:12:39.070
<v Speaker 4>flights of poetic fantasy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's also the case by the way,</v>

180
00:12:39.071 --> 00:12:43.360
<v Speaker 4>that that's actually how your brain is </v>
<v Speaker 4>organized as far as I can tell that when</v>

181
00:12:43.361 --> 00:12:44.800
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it isn't just me,</v>

182
00:12:44.801 --> 00:12:46.580
<v Speaker 4>I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

183
00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.180
<v Speaker 4>it's there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a very large,</v>

184
00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:51.880
<v Speaker 4>what would you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Research Literature,</v>

185
00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:55.240
<v Speaker 4>outlining the relative functions of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>right and left hemisphere,</v>

186
00:12:55.241 --> 00:13:00.241
<v Speaker 4>and it certainly appears to be the case </v>
<v Speaker 4>that when we encounter something </v>

187
00:13:00.241 --> 00:13:03.750
<v Speaker 4>absolutely unknowable or unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what we do is drape that unknown thing </v>

188
00:13:04.121 --> 00:13:09.121
<v Speaker 4>in fantasy as a first pass approximation</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the truth and then refine that </v>

189
00:13:09.521 --> 00:13:12.970
<v Speaker 4>fantasy as a consequence of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of iterative,</v>

190
00:13:12.971 --> 00:13:17.971
<v Speaker 4>critical analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so sam believes that what should </v>

191
00:13:17.971 --> 00:13:22.051
<v Speaker 4>happen is that the poetic and fictional </v>
<v Speaker 4>domain should be planted by the rational</v>

192
00:13:23.531 --> 00:13:24.010
<v Speaker 4>domain.</v>

193
00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:27.030
<v Speaker 2>Let me just close the loop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not quite.</v>

194
00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:32.050
<v Speaker 2>I think we need poetry and fiction and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then there's more to engage in with </v>

195
00:13:32.691 --> 00:13:36.080
<v Speaker 2>reality than than being a scientist in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>white lab coat.</v>

196
00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:41.500
<v Speaker 2>But we need to be able to clearly </v>
<v Speaker 2>distinguish back from fantasy or fact </v>

197
00:13:41.661 --> 00:13:46.661
<v Speaker 2>from mirror.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Merely fertile flights of imagination </v>

198
00:13:46.661 --> 00:13:49.760
<v Speaker 2>and we want to be rigorous there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>rational there,</v>

199
00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:54.820
<v Speaker 2>and it's not that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that there's no place for mere </v>

200
00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:57.770
<v Speaker 2>creativity that's not well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess in the rails of rationality.</v>

201
00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:03.060
<v Speaker 4>Fair enough then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then then partly what we are </v>

202
00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:03.170
<v Speaker 4>disputing is the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

203
00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:05.080
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the what,</v>

204
00:14:05.081 --> 00:14:09.190
<v Speaker 4>the relative import and have those two </v>
<v Speaker 4>domains,</v>

205
00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:11.660
<v Speaker 4>let's say the poetic and the fictional </v>
<v Speaker 4>and</v>

206
00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:14.210
<v Speaker 2>status of religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now in that.</v>

207
00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:19.340
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a hard time reconciling that to </v>

208
00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:19.340
<v Speaker 4>some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>With your,</v>

209
00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:20.970
<v Speaker 4>with your more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what would you say?</v>

210
00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:25.110
<v Speaker 4>Formal statements about the problem </v>
<v Speaker 4>because your mechanism,</v>

211
00:14:25.111 --> 00:14:30.111
<v Speaker 4>the mechanism that you put forth above </v>
<v Speaker 4>all outside of truth is rationality and </v>

212
00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:35.690
<v Speaker 4>it isn't clear to me if you're willing </v>
<v Speaker 4>to allow the utility of spiritual </v>

213
00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:40.581
<v Speaker 4>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which you do and if you're willing to </v>

214
00:14:40.581 --> 00:14:40.860
<v Speaker 4>make,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what would you say?</v>

215
00:14:40.861 --> 00:14:44.040
<v Speaker 4>Allowances for the necessity of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>poetic imagination.</v>

216
00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:49.520
<v Speaker 4>Exactly how it is that that is also </v>
<v Speaker 4>encapsulated under the rubric of pure </v>

217
00:14:50.521 --> 00:14:51.390
<v Speaker 4>rationality.</v>

218
00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:53.250
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's see.</v>

219
00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:58.690
<v Speaker 5>Here's something you can tell me what </v>
<v Speaker 5>you think about this and I've been </v>

220
00:14:58.690 --> 00:14:58.760
<v Speaker 5>thinking a lot about what salmon I've </v>
<v Speaker 5>been talking about.</v>

221
00:14:58.761 --> 00:15:00.120
<v Speaker 5>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

222
00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:05.220
<v Speaker 5>so I'm making the case in my writing </v>
<v Speaker 5>that democratic institutions not only </v>

223
00:15:05.361 --> 00:15:07.520
<v Speaker 5>grew out of the Judeo Christian </v>
<v Speaker 5>substrate,</v>

224
00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:13.480
<v Speaker 5>but that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that they're properly ensconced within </v>

225
00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:17.231
<v Speaker 5>that substrate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm also perfectly aware that not </v>

226
00:15:17.231 --> 00:15:21.431
<v Speaker 5>every religious or political system </v>
<v Speaker 5>gives rise to democratic institutions </v>

227
00:15:21.431 --> 00:15:25.630
<v Speaker 5>first and also that there are Christian </v>
<v Speaker 5>substructures,</v>

228
00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:31.780
<v Speaker 5>maybe the most obviously in the case of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the Russian Orthodox Church were the </v>

229
00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:36.131
<v Speaker 5>same metaphysical principles apply,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but out of which a democracy did not </v>

230
00:15:36.351 --> 00:15:41.351
<v Speaker 5>emerge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so it does seem to me that what we </v>

231
00:15:41.351 --> 00:15:44.861
<v Speaker 5>have in the West is the consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the interplay between the fantasy </v>

232
00:15:44.861 --> 00:15:49.211
<v Speaker 5>predicated poetic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Judeo Christian tradition and the </v>

233
00:15:49.211 --> 00:15:51.860
<v Speaker 5>rational critique that was aimed at that</v>
<v Speaker 5>by the enlightenment figures.</v>

234
00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:57.160
<v Speaker 5>And that seems to me to mirror something</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the proper balance between the </v>

235
00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:00.701
<v Speaker 5>right hemisphere and it's poetic </v>
<v Speaker 5>imagination and the left hemisphere and </v>

236
00:16:00.701 --> 00:16:04.271
<v Speaker 5>it's critical capacity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then I would say that part of the </v>

237
00:16:04.271 --> 00:16:07.781
<v Speaker 5>way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So one of the questions you brought up </v>

238
00:16:07.781 --> 00:16:10.121
<v Speaker 5>was how do we decide which,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say religious intuitions are </v>

239
00:16:10.821 --> 00:16:15.821
<v Speaker 5>valid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think we do that in part through </v>

240
00:16:15.821 --> 00:16:16.120
<v Speaker 5>negotiated agreement.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

241
00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:19.790
<v Speaker 5>because people have look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even even among the Catholics,</v>

242
00:16:19.791 --> 00:16:23.110
<v Speaker 5>say in the medieval time there was an </v>
<v Speaker 5>absolute horror of heresy,</v>

243
00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:27.860
<v Speaker 5>so if you were some mendicant monks and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you had a profound religious vision,</v>

244
00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:33.430
<v Speaker 5>the probability that you were going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>be tried as a heretic and burnt at the </v>

245
00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:36.581
<v Speaker 5>stake was extremely high because even </v>
<v Speaker 5>the gatekeepers of the religious </v>

246
00:16:36.581 --> 00:16:40.121
<v Speaker 5>tradition realized that religious </v>
<v Speaker 5>revelation untrammeled by something like</v>

247
00:16:40.731 --> 00:16:45.731
<v Speaker 5>community dialogue,</v>
<v Speaker 5>something like that was something </v>

248
00:16:45.731 --> 00:16:45.731
<v Speaker 5>extraordinary,</v>
<v Speaker 5>extraordinary danger,</v>

249
00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:50.890
<v Speaker 5>and so I would agree with you that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>poetic imagination and the grounds of </v>

250
00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:53.600
<v Speaker 5>religious revelation is something that </v>
<v Speaker 5>can lead people dangerously astray,</v>

251
00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:58.900
<v Speaker 5>but I would say at the same time that it</v>
<v Speaker 5>constitutes the grounds of our initial </v>

252
00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:01.280
<v Speaker 5>exploration and that it's actually </v>
<v Speaker 5>ineradicable necessary.</v>

253
00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:06.690
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll briefly address that and I don't </v>

254
00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:06.690
<v Speaker 2>want to ask a question that brings </v>
<v Speaker 2>Douglas directly in here.</v>

255
00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:11.320
<v Speaker 2>I think this is an instance that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's called the genetic fallacy.</v>

256
00:17:11.321 --> 00:17:16.321
<v Speaker 2>The idea that because something emerged </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way it did historically as a matter </v>

257
00:17:16.571 --> 00:17:19.120
<v Speaker 2>of historical contingency,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is the,</v>

258
00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.270
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

259
00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:25.300
<v Speaker 2>the origin is in fact good and worth </v>
<v Speaker 2>maintaining a or that it was in fact </v>

260
00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:29.200
<v Speaker 2>necessary that we couldn't get these </v>
<v Speaker 2>good things like democracy any other way</v>

261
00:17:29.201 --> 00:17:30.850
<v Speaker 2>or unlikely to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would say that,</v>

262
00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:36.240
<v Speaker 2>that there's no abrahamic religion that </v>
<v Speaker 2>is the best conceivable womb of </v>

263
00:17:36.821 --> 00:17:39.580
<v Speaker 2>democracy or anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We like science.</v>

264
00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:41.010
<v Speaker 5>That's a great place to get done.</v>

265
00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:42.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

266
00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:42.760
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

267
00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:46.570
<v Speaker 2>I would just add one other category of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of uh,</v>

268
00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:51.850
<v Speaker 2>thinking here we have what we think is </v>
<v Speaker 2>factual methods by which we derived </v>

269
00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:56.511
<v Speaker 2>facts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would put a rationality there and an </v>

270
00:17:56.511 --> 00:17:56.880
<v Speaker 2>empirical engagement with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with reality.</v>

271
00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:02.540
<v Speaker 2>Then we have other good things in life </v>
<v Speaker 2>like fiction and flights of fancy that </v>

272
00:18:03.751 --> 00:18:08.610
<v Speaker 2>are pleasing for one reason or another </v>
<v Speaker 2>and could be generative toward the first</v>

273
00:18:08.611 --> 00:18:12.400
<v Speaker 2>category.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then we also have A.</v>

274
00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:15.030
<v Speaker 2>I would acknowledge we've spoken about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this before,</v>

275
00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:17.830
<v Speaker 2>useful fictions and cases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

276
00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:22.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hope rare cases where were fiction is </v>

277
00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:25.680
<v Speaker 2>more adaptive or more useful than the </v>
<v Speaker 2>truth.</v>

278
00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:26.460
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That there,</v>

279
00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:31.500
<v Speaker 2>there's sometimes the truth can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can be not worth knowing and I would </v>

280
00:18:31.591 --> 00:18:32.250
<v Speaker 2>argue that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

281
00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:35.520
<v Speaker 2>there are those cases where they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're few and far between,</v>

282
00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:37.800
<v Speaker 2>but we should focus on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But to some degree.</v>

283
00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:42.810
<v Speaker 2>So I want to just point to Douglas here </v>
<v Speaker 2>and focus on that because I think your </v>

284
00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:42.810
<v Speaker 2>fear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Douglas,</v>

285
00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:46.581
<v Speaker 2>is that my style or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Richard Dawkins or Christopher Hitchens,</v>

286
00:18:46.771 --> 00:18:49.710
<v Speaker 2>his style of antitheism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

287
00:18:49.711 --> 00:18:50.550
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>

288
00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:55.610
<v Speaker 2>let's just throw the vickers from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rooftops now because it is time to end </v>

289
00:18:55.621 --> 00:18:59.430
<v Speaker 2>this thing literally get off twitter </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

290
00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:02.080
<v Speaker 1>That's a Hashtag</v>

291
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:07.880
<v Speaker 2>your concern has been that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

292
00:19:07.881 --> 00:19:10.190
<v Speaker 2>and I think Jordan shares this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

293
00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:15.220
<v Speaker 2>that so much of what is good in our </v>
<v Speaker 2>Western developed societies is at the </v>

294
00:19:17.961 --> 00:19:22.961
<v Speaker 2>very least maintained by maintain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maintaining so-called Judeo Christian </v>

295
00:19:24.051 --> 00:19:28.760
<v Speaker 2>values or the or the remnants of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>past religiosity.</v>

296
00:19:28.761 --> 00:19:33.761
<v Speaker 2>And that either there is a baby in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bathwater that can be difficult to </v>

297
00:19:33.761 --> 00:19:35.660
<v Speaker 2>discern.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we can't empty the tub all at once.</v>

298
00:19:35.661 --> 00:19:40.661
<v Speaker 2>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is very much a because there's </v>

299
00:19:40.661 --> 00:19:42.581
<v Speaker 2>a zero sum contest with the religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>enthusiasm we see coming from the Muslim</v>

300
00:19:42.861 --> 00:19:47.861
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and of course the Muslim world is all </v>

301
00:19:47.861 --> 00:19:50.510
<v Speaker 2>over the world at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in that contest between a very,</v>

302
00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:54.890
<v Speaker 2>an older style of religiosity and be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>theocracy really,</v>

303
00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:59.150
<v Speaker 2>and maternity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are not as eager as I have been to,</v>

304
00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:03.230
<v Speaker 2>to pull up western religiosity by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>roots.</v>

305
00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:05.230
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chuck [inaudible] the vickers.</v>

306
00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:07.690
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

307
00:20:07.691 --> 00:20:08.950
<v Speaker 1>I think that's fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

308
00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:13.180
<v Speaker 1>I think I sit metaphorically as well as </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally between the two of you.</v>

309
00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:18.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I realized from our conversation in </v>

310
00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:21.961
<v Speaker 1>Dublin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of your concerns are about what </v>

311
00:20:21.961 --> 00:20:22.690
<v Speaker 1>Jordan has been saying and what he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>

312
00:20:22.691 --> 00:20:27.691
<v Speaker 1>And I share some of the concern I said </v>
<v Speaker 1>to you then that I use the analogy of </v>

313
00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:34.320
<v Speaker 1>what our friend Eric Weinstein recently </v>
<v Speaker 1>described to me as Jesus smuggling,</v>

314
00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:39.430
<v Speaker 1>that it was a consequence of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion about biologists.</v>

315
00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:43.870
<v Speaker 1>What do you do if you're discussing </v>
<v Speaker 1>design intelligent design?</v>

316
00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:49.990
<v Speaker 1>You can be okay as as your own bandwidth</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the of the issue,</v>

317
00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:54.220
<v Speaker 1>as long as your in depth of knowledge on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the issue is very considerable.</v>

318
00:20:54.221 --> 00:20:58.330
<v Speaker 1>You can be okay discussing that biology </v>
<v Speaker 1>with somebody,</v>

319
00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:03.810
<v Speaker 1>even a fundamentalist Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so long as you can follow every step of </v>

320
00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:08.341
<v Speaker 1>the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fear will always be that the moment </v>

321
00:21:08.341 --> 00:21:10.510
<v Speaker 1>you're not looking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to smuggle Jesus in.</v>

322
00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:18.760
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll wait until the moment that </v>

323
00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:18.760
<v Speaker 1>you're not comfortable anymore with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument,</v>

324
00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:22.630
<v Speaker 1>the bit when you're at the very end of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your cognitive ability and then they'll </v>

325
00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:23.140
<v Speaker 1>trust me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's Jesus.</v>

326
00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:23.900
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>

327
00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:24.980
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

328
00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:28.460
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things I realized from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dublin was,</v>

329
00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:34.840
<v Speaker 1>although I think you may not think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jordan himself is going to try Jesus </v>

330
00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:40.270
<v Speaker 1>smuggling on you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fear that somewhere down the line </v>

331
00:21:40.281 --> 00:21:43.010
<v Speaker 1>from what he's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody else will do that trick.</v>

332
00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:44.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's worse than that.</v>

333
00:21:44.311 --> 00:21:49.311
<v Speaker 2>I actually know the people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people who were clapping are doing </v>

334
00:21:49.311 --> 00:21:54.081
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hear from those people on a daily </v>

335
00:21:54.081 --> 00:21:54.081
<v Speaker 2>basis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

336
00:21:54.081 --> 00:21:54.210
<v Speaker 2>So that the segment of Jordan's </v>
<v Speaker 2>audience,</v>

337
00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:59.590
<v Speaker 2>that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is very happy to be told they can </v>

338
00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:02.661
<v Speaker 2>stay on the riverbank of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>traditional Christianity for the most </v>

339
00:22:02.661 --> 00:22:06.471
<v Speaker 2>part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they don't have to get into the </v>

340
00:22:06.471 --> 00:22:07.320
<v Speaker 2>stream of totally modern,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rigorous,</v>

341
00:22:07.321 --> 00:22:10.320
<v Speaker 2>rational thinking about everything from </v>
<v Speaker 2>first principles,</v>

342
00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:11.900
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That there's something that,</v>

343
00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:16.440
<v Speaker 2>that the Iron Age scribes got right and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's right for all time.</v>

344
00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:19.290
<v Speaker 2>Those are the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are the applause.</v>

345
00:22:19.291 --> 00:22:20.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm hearing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

346
00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:21.260
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

347
00:22:21.261 --> 00:22:22.110
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>however,</v>

348
00:22:22.111 --> 00:22:27.111
<v Speaker 2>consciously or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jordan is telling them it's okay to </v>

349
00:22:27.111 --> 00:22:27.840
<v Speaker 2>stay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stick right there with a,</v>

350
00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:29.370
<v Speaker 2>with a Shard of the cross.</v>

351
00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:30.050
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

352
00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:35.570
<v Speaker 4>I actually tried a little conscious </v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus smuggling on Sam to see how that </v>

353
00:22:35.651 --> 00:22:40.060
<v Speaker 4>would go into discussion we had about </v>
<v Speaker 4>the central archetype of superheroes.</v>

354
00:22:40.061 --> 00:22:41.890
<v Speaker 4>But I'm going to try something a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>different tonight.</v>

355
00:22:41.891 --> 00:22:44.050
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to try a little direct God </v>
<v Speaker 4>smuggling.</v>

356
00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:47.170
<v Speaker 4>We won't bother with Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's go right to God.</v>

357
00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:49.330
<v Speaker 4>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

358
00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:54.430
<v Speaker 4>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the things I've really tried to </v>

359
00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:56.461
<v Speaker 4>do when I've been analyzing religious </v>
<v Speaker 4>texts is to take them as to take them </v>

360
00:22:57.850 --> 00:23:02.850
<v Speaker 4>seriously in the sense that I don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>presume that I understand them and I </v>

361
00:23:03.041 --> 00:23:07.360
<v Speaker 4>presume that they're a mystery of sorts </v>
<v Speaker 4>and at least the Bible,</v>

362
00:23:07.361 --> 00:23:12.361
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is a mystery because we don't really </v>

363
00:23:12.361 --> 00:23:15.031
<v Speaker 4>understand the processes by which it was</v>
<v Speaker 4>constructed and we don't understand the </v>

364
00:23:15.031 --> 00:23:18.460
<v Speaker 4>processes by which we all agreed </v>
<v Speaker 4>collectively over several thousand years</v>

365
00:23:18.461 --> 00:23:23.461
<v Speaker 4>to organize the book the way it is </v>
<v Speaker 4>organized or to edit it the way that </v>

366
00:23:23.461 --> 00:23:28.351
<v Speaker 4>it's edited or end to keep what's in it </v>
<v Speaker 4>and to end to discard what's not in it </v>

367
00:23:28.351 --> 00:23:31.720
<v Speaker 4>and why it's lasted and why it's had </v>
<v Speaker 4>such a huge impact.</v>

368
00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:36.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to derail you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we do understand that the first part</v>

369
00:23:36.001 --> 00:23:39.270
<v Speaker 2>of the process all too well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know that the.</v>

370
00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:44.510
<v Speaker 2>There was a political and all too human </v>
<v Speaker 2>process of voting certain texts in for </v>

371
00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:50.620
<v Speaker 2>and some were in for centuries and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>got jettisoned and revelation came in </v>

372
00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:55.451
<v Speaker 2>far later than.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the whole generations of </v>

373
00:23:55.451 --> 00:23:58.031
<v Speaker 2>Christians who lived and died under the </v>
<v Speaker 2>banner of the Bible and it was a </v>

374
00:23:58.031 --> 00:23:59.360
<v Speaker 2>different Bible at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had the wrong Bible.</v>

375
00:23:59.361 --> 00:23:59.600
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

376
00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:01.790
<v Speaker 6>but it's the same.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's the same issue that,</v>

377
00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:04.470
<v Speaker 6>that we really don't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We really don't understand.</v>

378
00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:05.430
<v Speaker 6>Fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Salmon,</v>

379
00:24:05.431 --> 00:24:09.210
<v Speaker 6>I'm not saying that political etc.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Considerations didn't enter into it.</v>

380
00:24:09.211 --> 00:24:11.460
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure all human Considerations </v>
<v Speaker 6>entered into it,</v>

381
00:24:11.461 --> 00:24:16.461
<v Speaker 6>but there was some collective process of</v>
<v Speaker 6>winnowing and you can attempt to reduce </v>

382
00:24:16.771 --> 00:24:21.771
<v Speaker 6>that to economic or political causes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is generally what secular </v>

383
00:24:21.771 --> 00:24:25.250
<v Speaker 6>assessors like freud and marx both did </v>
<v Speaker 6>and with a fair degree of success side,</v>

384
00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:28.770
<v Speaker 6>my dad.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But there's still some mysterious,</v>

385
00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:33.900
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>assessment of what it is that will be </v>

386
00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:37.131
<v Speaker 6>remembered that entered into it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But It's a separate point to some </v>

387
00:24:37.131 --> 00:24:38.550
<v Speaker 6>degree.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I'm just saying that my point,</v>

388
00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:39.290
<v Speaker 6>my,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my,</v>

389
00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:42.350
<v Speaker 6>my point of departure when looking at </v>
<v Speaker 6>these texts,</v>

390
00:24:42.351 --> 00:24:44.850
<v Speaker 6>who's one of an essential radical </v>
<v Speaker 6>ignorance,</v>

391
00:24:44.851 --> 00:24:49.851
<v Speaker 6>I don't assume that I understand the </v>
<v Speaker 6>mechanisms by which they were generated </v>

392
00:24:49.851 --> 00:24:54.561
<v Speaker 6>or edited or collected or kept or </v>
<v Speaker 6>remembered or why they had the impact </v>

393
00:24:54.991 --> 00:24:55.410
<v Speaker 6>they had.</v>

394
00:24:55.440 --> 00:25:00.210
<v Speaker 6>now I've been thinking a lot about the </v>
<v Speaker 6>idea of let's say god the father,</v>

395
00:25:00.211 --> 00:25:03.480
<v Speaker 6>because that's a very common </v>
<v Speaker 6>architectural representation of god,</v>

396
00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:08.780
<v Speaker 6>god the father.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I'm going to tell you an experience </v>

397
00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:09.720
<v Speaker 6>that I had that I've never really told </v>
<v Speaker 6>any audience about.</v>

398
00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:15.500
<v Speaker 6>I had a vision at one point that and the</v>
<v Speaker 6>vision had to do with a dialogue that I </v>

399
00:25:15.601 --> 00:25:18.900
<v Speaker 6>was having with my father.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you know you have a father,</v>

400
00:25:18.930 --> 00:25:20.970
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And when you're a little kid,</v>

401
00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:25.560
<v Speaker 6>you act out your father.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When you pretend to be a father and what</v>

402
00:25:25.561 --> 00:25:30.561
<v Speaker 6>you're doing when you're acting out,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your father isn't imitating your father </v>

403
00:25:30.561 --> 00:25:34.431
<v Speaker 6>because you don't duplicate precisely </v>
<v Speaker 6>the actions that your father ever took </v>

404
00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:40.220
<v Speaker 6>in his life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>what you do is you watch your father </v>

405
00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:43.341
<v Speaker 6>across multiple contexts and you </v>
<v Speaker 6>abstract out something like a spirit of </v>

406
00:25:43.341 --> 00:25:48.231
<v Speaker 6>the father and then when you're a child,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you implement that spirit of the father </v>

407
00:25:48.231 --> 00:25:51.150
<v Speaker 6>in your pretend play and you come to </v>
<v Speaker 6>embody that deeply.</v>

408
00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:56.150
<v Speaker 6>So the notion is that people can </v>
<v Speaker 6>abstract out something like a spirit of </v>

409
00:25:56.150 --> 00:25:59.520
<v Speaker 6>the father and that that's part of our </v>
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible] mimetic tendency,</v>

410
00:25:59.521 --> 00:26:01.830
<v Speaker 6>which is a very powerful human cognitive</v>
<v Speaker 6>tendency.</v>

411
00:26:01.831 --> 00:26:06.210
<v Speaker 6>And in this vision I first started to </v>
<v Speaker 6>talk with my father and I would say more</v>

412
00:26:06.211 --> 00:26:10.560
<v Speaker 6>with the spirit of my father because he </v>
<v Speaker 6>wasn't actually there and I would say it</v>

413
00:26:10.561 --> 00:26:13.680
<v Speaker 6>was the wisest part of him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then that sort of transformed into a</v>

414
00:26:13.681 --> 00:26:16.650
<v Speaker 6>discussion that I had with a series of </v>
<v Speaker 6>ancestral spirits.</v>

415
00:26:16.651 --> 00:26:21.651
<v Speaker 6>And then that transformed itself into a </v>
<v Speaker 6>vision of god himself with whom I have a</v>

416
00:26:22.351 --> 00:26:25.020
<v Speaker 6>conversation and this was a visionary </v>
<v Speaker 6>experience.</v>

417
00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:30.500
<v Speaker 6>And then that all went away and I spent </v>
<v Speaker 6>months and months thinking about it and </v>

418
00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:33.390
<v Speaker 6>I thought so you guys can tell me what </v>
<v Speaker 6>you think about this.</v>

419
00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:36.490
<v Speaker 6>And this sort of stretches my cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 6>ability to,</v>

420
00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:39.330
<v Speaker 6>to its utmost limit to contemplate such </v>
<v Speaker 6>things.</v>

421
00:26:39.331 --> 00:26:44.010
<v Speaker 6>But here's a biological argument.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I already made the that a child</v>

422
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:47.470
<v Speaker 5>can extract out the spirit of the father</v>
<v Speaker 5>and embody it.</v>

423
00:26:47.471 --> 00:26:52.471
<v Speaker 5>Didn't that's necessary in so far as </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going to be a father and a wise </v>

424
00:26:52.471 --> 00:26:55.670
<v Speaker 5>one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But we can also extract out the spirit </v>

425
00:26:55.670 --> 00:26:58.401
<v Speaker 5>of the father over much longer periods </v>
<v Speaker 5>of time because my father was a father </v>

426
00:26:58.441 --> 00:27:01.320
<v Speaker 5>because he imitated his father who </v>
<v Speaker 5>imitated his father,</v>

427
00:27:01.321 --> 00:27:04.680
<v Speaker 5>who imitated his father as far back in </v>
<v Speaker 5>time as you can go,</v>

428
00:27:04.681 --> 00:27:09.090
<v Speaker 5>and there's a cumulative development of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the spirit of the farther across time.</v>

429
00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:14.660
<v Speaker 5>Now then the question might be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>does this spirit of the father have any </v>

430
00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:15.120
<v Speaker 5>reality other than the metaphorical?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I would say,</v>

431
00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:20.390
<v Speaker 5>damn right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it has a reality and I can describe a </v>

432
00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:20.390
<v Speaker 5>biological reality.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And and,</v>

433
00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:22.920
<v Speaker 5>and I don't know what this says about </v>
<v Speaker 5>any background metaphysics,</v>

434
00:27:22.921 --> 00:27:27.921
<v Speaker 5>but here's a hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We know that human beings separated from</v>

435
00:27:29.281 --> 00:27:32.610
<v Speaker 5>chimpanzees over the course of the last </v>
<v Speaker 5>7 million years,</v>

436
00:27:32.611 --> 00:27:36.450
<v Speaker 5>at least in large part because of human </v>
<v Speaker 5>female sexual activity.</v>

437
00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:41.870
<v Speaker 5>So it was the spirit of femininity </v>
<v Speaker 5>collectively that helped elevate us to </v>

438
00:27:42.091 --> 00:27:45.750
<v Speaker 5>the degree that we have been elevated </v>
<v Speaker 5>above our chimpanzee co ancestor.</v>

439
00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:48.300
<v Speaker 5>But here's something interesting to </v>
<v Speaker 5>contemplate.</v>

440
00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:53.010
<v Speaker 5>What is it precisely that makes men what</v>
<v Speaker 5>makes men desirable to women?</v>

441
00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:55.620
<v Speaker 5>And so I have a bit of a hypothesis </v>
<v Speaker 5>about that.</v>

442
00:27:55.621 --> 00:28:00.621
<v Speaker 5>So here's what men do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They get together in productive groups </v>

443
00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:06.080
<v Speaker 5>and the orient themselves toward a </v>
<v Speaker 5>certain task and they produce a </v>

444
00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:08.490
<v Speaker 5>hierarchy around that task because </v>
<v Speaker 5>whenever you implement a task,</v>

445
00:28:08.491 --> 00:28:13.410
<v Speaker 5>you produce a hierarchy and they vote up</v>
<v Speaker 5>the most competent men to the top of the</v>

446
00:28:13.411 --> 00:28:18.411
<v Speaker 5>hierarchy and then the women's select </v>
<v Speaker 5>the competent men from the top of the </v>

447
00:28:18.411 --> 00:28:21.801
<v Speaker 5>hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the vote that determines who the </v>

448
00:28:21.801 --> 00:28:24.591
<v Speaker 5>competent men are that are more likely </v>
<v Speaker 5>to reproduce as a consequence of male </v>

449
00:28:24.591 --> 00:28:27.540
<v Speaker 5>evaluation of men.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's occurred over millennia.</v>

450
00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:32.750
<v Speaker 5>And so there's a spirit of the father </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's embedded in the patriarchal </v>

451
00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:36.711
<v Speaker 5>hierarchy that acts as the primary </v>
<v Speaker 5>selection mechanism that offers men up </v>

452
00:28:36.711 --> 00:28:37.030
<v Speaker 5>to women and plays us.</v>

453
00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:40.790
<v Speaker 5>Our cardinal role in human evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it looks like we've.</v>

454
00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:45.950
<v Speaker 5>We've personiFied that spirit of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>father in our religious imagery and and </v>

455
00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:46.980
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's how it looks to Me.</v>

456
00:28:46.981 --> 00:28:51.981
<v Speaker 5>But then there's something that's even </v>
<v Speaker 5>more mysterious and deep about that </v>

457
00:28:51.981 --> 00:28:55.251
<v Speaker 5>that's worth considering,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that apparently the entire course of </v>

458
00:28:55.251 --> 00:28:57.330
<v Speaker 5>evolutionary history has conspired to </v>
<v Speaker 5>produce human beings.</v>

459
00:28:57.540 --> 00:28:59.580
<v Speaker 5>And we could argue that it could have </v>
<v Speaker 5>been different,</v>

460
00:28:59.581 --> 00:29:04.581
<v Speaker 5>but it certainly hasn't been different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that means that that selective </v>

461
00:29:04.581 --> 00:29:08.271
<v Speaker 5>spirit of the father has been part of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the process that's generated our very </v>

462
00:29:08.271 --> 00:29:13.131
<v Speaker 5>being,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's certainly possible that that </v>

463
00:29:13.131 --> 00:29:15.141
<v Speaker 5>collective spirit of the father reflects</v>
<v Speaker 5>something metaphysically fundamental </v>

464
00:29:15.141 --> 00:29:17.940
<v Speaker 5>about the structure of reality itself a </v>
<v Speaker 5>way</v>

465
00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:20.450
<v Speaker 3>yes</v>

466
00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:29.910
<v Speaker 2>into insofar as I agree with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with virtually all of that,</v>

467
00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:35.000
<v Speaker 2>I should say that none of that should </v>
<v Speaker 2>give comfort to people who want to hold </v>

468
00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.141
<v Speaker 2>onto this notion that certain of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>books might've been revealed by the </v>

469
00:29:39.141 --> 00:29:39.141
<v Speaker 2>creator of the universe.</v>

470
00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:42.280
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it depends what you by the creator.</v>

471
00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:42.420
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

472
00:29:42.530 --> 00:29:44.150
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm just saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

473
00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:49.440
<v Speaker 2>that the world we're living in now is </v>
<v Speaker 2>one in which we have whole societies </v>

474
00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:54.900
<v Speaker 2>shattered over this notion that some </v>
<v Speaker 2>books weren't written by human beings.</v>

475
00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:57.630
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a different class of book,</v>

476
00:29:57.660 --> 00:29:59.490
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a different shelf in the library</v>

477
00:29:59.491 --> 00:30:04.491
<v Speaker 2>where the products of almost certainly </v>
<v Speaker 2>merely human brains are venerated for </v>

478
00:30:06.661 --> 00:30:11.661
<v Speaker 2>all time and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and considered uneditable and </v>

479
00:30:11.661 --> 00:30:13.410
<v Speaker 2>uninsurable five by the majority of </v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings.</v>

480
00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:14.010
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

481
00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:19.100
<v Speaker 1>it's clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clear that revelation can devolve into </v>

482
00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:19.160
<v Speaker 1>fundamentalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm real,</v>

483
00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:22.170
<v Speaker 1>but any.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there is a risk,</v>

484
00:30:22.171 --> 00:30:24.480
<v Speaker 1>and alyssa whizzes isn't often made </v>
<v Speaker 1>critique,</v>

485
00:30:24.570 --> 00:30:28.530
<v Speaker 1>but when you're talking about religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about the inquisition,</v>

486
00:30:28.531 --> 00:30:33.531
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about the jihadists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not talking about somebody who </v>

487
00:30:33.531 --> 00:30:34.950
<v Speaker 1>wants to go to their local anglican </v>
<v Speaker 1>church once a year,</v>

488
00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:40.430
<v Speaker 1>maybe get the children to school and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe when they at some desolate moment </v>

489
00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:42.990
<v Speaker 1>of their lives returns to this as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>place that stores meaning.</v>

490
00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:47.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean the thing that I think Jordan and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I are in agreement on them this is,</v>

491
00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:52.700
<v Speaker 1>is that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a quote from shop in the heart and the </v>

492
00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:52.930
<v Speaker 1>dialogue on religion when he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

493
00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:56.490
<v Speaker 1>the truth may be like water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It needs vessels to carry it.</v>

494
00:30:57.030 --> 00:31:02.030
<v Speaker 1>And we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we were talking about this the </v>

495
00:31:02.030 --> 00:31:02.030
<v Speaker 1>other night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

496
00:31:02.030 --> 00:31:03.300
<v Speaker 1>you admitted that one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences perhaps of the,</v>

497
00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:08.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the parents sort of going through the </v>

498
00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:08.600
<v Speaker 1>belief structures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they may not believe in any more,</v>

499
00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:11.840
<v Speaker 1>but they keep doing it as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>demonstration of what you said was the,</v>

500
00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:17.210
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the non embarrassing options that </v>

501
00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:17.210
<v Speaker 1>atheists have come up with.</v>

502
00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:22.040
<v Speaker 1>But it may also be that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since we don't have very many vessels </v>

503
00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:28.260
<v Speaker 1>that cracked and damaged and sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>transparent as they are,</v>

504
00:31:28.530 --> 00:31:31.440
<v Speaker 1>what vessels you have might be worth </v>
<v Speaker 1>holding onto?</v>

505
00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:32.870
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

506
00:31:32.871 --> 00:31:37.871
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the challenge here is mean it </v>

507
00:31:37.871 --> 00:31:37.900
<v Speaker 2>feels that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

508
00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:43.180
<v Speaker 2>first of all we should first notice that</v>
<v Speaker 2>these comments very often take the form </v>

509
00:31:43.191 --> 00:31:48.191
<v Speaker 2>of you and I don't need this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but most other people do.</v>

510
00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:49.940
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that is,</v>

511
00:31:50.410 --> 00:31:52.110
<v Speaker 2>it can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

512
00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:57.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's inevitably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if it's sort of took that form at </v>

513
00:31:57.260 --> 00:31:59.920
<v Speaker 2>one moment the other night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas where you acknowledged that,</v>

514
00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:04.950
<v Speaker 2>that people have low intelligence are </v>
<v Speaker 2>our best placed in a conservative </v>

515
00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:10.960
<v Speaker 2>paradigm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a traditionally conservative paradigm </v>

516
00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:13.420
<v Speaker 2>paradigm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because there's less to think through </v>

517
00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:13.420
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously you don't want your,</v>

518
00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:16.760
<v Speaker 2>your view on religion summarized by it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>good for stupid people.</v>

519
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:22.000
<v Speaker 7>Well I do.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I do want to summarize to some degree </v>

520
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.521
<v Speaker 7>that way because one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 7>we do have the opportunity again to put </v>

521
00:32:24.521 --> 00:32:26.330
<v Speaker 7>his foot in your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But I would say not,</v>

522
00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:27.870
<v Speaker 7>not only.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

523
00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:32.950
<v Speaker 7>the thing is is that we're all stupid </v>
<v Speaker 7>and some of us are far stupider than </v>

524
00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:32.950
<v Speaker 7>others,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but we're not,</v>

525
00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:34.250
<v Speaker 7>but we're not that stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

526
00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:36.560
<v Speaker 7>there is another problem,</v>
<v Speaker 7>sam.</v>

527
00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:39.930
<v Speaker 7>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and this is obviously contentious one,</v>

528
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:45.250
<v Speaker 6>one of the things I don't go to church,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but there is one thing I admire about </v>

529
00:32:45.250 --> 00:32:50.080
<v Speaker 6>the church and that is that it's managed</v>
<v Speaker 6>to serve as a repository for these </v>

530
00:32:51.650 --> 00:32:56.650
<v Speaker 6>fundamental underlying fictions for two </v>
<v Speaker 6>millennia and that's really something </v>

531
00:32:56.650 --> 00:32:58.760
<v Speaker 6>bloody unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean the great,</v>

532
00:32:59.630 --> 00:33:00.320
<v Speaker 6>what would you say?</v>

533
00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:01.730
<v Speaker 2>Bloody unbelievable.</v>

534
00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:02.880
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>look sam there.</v>

535
00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:04.400
<v Speaker 6>Everything's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>everything's.</v>

536
00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:08.060
<v Speaker 6>Everything's soaked in blood.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We have no disagreement about that,</v>

537
00:33:08.061 --> 00:33:13.061
<v Speaker 6>but the second or alternatives that we </v>
<v Speaker 6>produced in the 20th century were </v>

538
00:33:13.061 --> 00:33:15.330
<v Speaker 6>certainly no less blood sodom and they'd</v>
<v Speaker 6>produced nothing of any productivity.</v>

539
00:33:15.910 --> 00:33:20.910
<v Speaker 2>We did not do it now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we have to put to bed that secular </v>

540
00:33:20.910 --> 00:33:24.450
<v Speaker 2>canard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just not so that stalin ism was the</v>

541
00:33:25.811 --> 00:33:29.140
<v Speaker 2>product of secularism or atheism and </v>
<v Speaker 2>norwood.</v>

542
00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:33.680
<v Speaker 6>It wasn't an inevitable product or </v>
<v Speaker 6>products.</v>

543
00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:39.240
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't bay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And please anyone who has this meme in </v>

544
00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:40.270
<v Speaker 2>your head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please just allow.</v>

545
00:33:40.271 --> 00:33:45.271
<v Speaker 2>The next sentence is I speak to just </v>
<v Speaker 2>push it out because I'm so sick of </v>

546
00:33:45.271 --> 00:33:45.460
<v Speaker 2>hearing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

547
00:33:46.530 --> 00:33:51.530
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this idea that the greatest crimes of </v>

548
00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:51.530
<v Speaker 2>the 20th century where somehow the </v>
<v Speaker 2>product of atheism,</v>

549
00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:56.900
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you look at what actually </v>

550
00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:59.131
<v Speaker 2>engineered these atrocities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was something that looked very much </v>

551
00:33:59.351 --> 00:34:04.351
<v Speaker 2>like a religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a religion in every way apart </v>

552
00:34:04.351 --> 00:34:05.590
<v Speaker 2>from an explicit commitment to other </v>
<v Speaker 2>worldliness.</v>

553
00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:09.820
<v Speaker 2>It was based on different dogmatism </v>
<v Speaker 2>through and through.</v>

554
00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:12.390
<v Speaker 2>It was based on a personality cults </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

555
00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:15.590
<v Speaker 2>that grew up around figures like stalin </v>
<v Speaker 2>and hitler and mao.</v>

556
00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:18.120
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these were the,</v>

557
00:34:18.180 --> 00:34:23.180
<v Speaker 2>it was not the ideas of bertrand russell</v>
<v Speaker 2>and david hume that brought us to the </v>

558
00:34:23.180 --> 00:34:24.450
<v Speaker 2>gulag or to auschwitz.</v>

559
00:34:24.570 --> 00:34:26.730
<v Speaker 6>But then you say it's the thought of </v>
<v Speaker 6>jesus christ.</v>

560
00:34:26.731 --> 00:34:28.460
<v Speaker 6>either we know it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

561
00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:30.150
<v Speaker 6>I can say that I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can say it</v>

562
00:34:30.450 --> 00:34:35.450
<v Speaker 2>thought of st augustine and I can say it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was the thought of st thomas aquinas </v>

563
00:34:35.450 --> 00:34:38.400
<v Speaker 2>explicitly that gave us the inquisition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact.</v>

564
00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:40.530
<v Speaker 1>Can I make a suggestion?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

565
00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:43.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is a general one as well as </v>
<v Speaker 1>one for tonight,</v>

566
00:34:43.290 --> 00:34:45.450
<v Speaker 1>but the whole discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

567
00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:48.150
<v Speaker 1>I said the other night in dublin that to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a great extent,</v>

568
00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:50.520
<v Speaker 1>when the history books are written about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the period we're living in,</v>

569
00:34:50.521 --> 00:34:55.050
<v Speaker 1>they'll probably be described as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>post holocaust period in history,</v>

570
00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:57.850
<v Speaker 1>the post world war two era in europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll.</v>

571
00:34:57.930 --> 00:34:59.610
<v Speaker 1>It's still going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're still.</v>

572
00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:02.670
<v Speaker 1>We're still going through this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to work out what happened,</v>

573
00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:08.420
<v Speaker 1>and I have to say one thing that I at </v>
<v Speaker 1>any rate and equally tired of is the </v>

574
00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:12.891
<v Speaker 1>claim that this has got to Be a tennis </v>
<v Speaker 1>game between the religious and </v>

575
00:35:12.891 --> 00:35:16.460
<v Speaker 1>nonreligious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people say that the 20th century's </v>

576
00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:19.170
<v Speaker 1>crimes were committed by atheists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes true,</v>

577
00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:21.420
<v Speaker 1>often wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or that the 20th century,</v>

578
00:35:21.421 --> 00:35:23.460
<v Speaker 1>his crimes were committed by people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>were religious,</v>

579
00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:25.290
<v Speaker 1>sometimes true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often wrong.</v>

580
00:35:26.370 --> 00:35:31.370
<v Speaker 2>Nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not observing a crucial </v>

581
00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:33.251
<v Speaker 2>distinction here because I would never </v>
<v Speaker 2>be tempted to hold religion accountable </v>

582
00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:38.470
<v Speaker 2>for the band.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things that religious people do that </v>

583
00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:39.570
<v Speaker 2>have no connection to religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

584
00:35:39.571 --> 00:35:44.571
<v Speaker 2>So if a muslim robs the liquor store,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to blame islam for that.</v>

585
00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:49.790
<v Speaker 2>Or there's no dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no doctrine that there's no </v>

586
00:35:50.431 --> 00:35:52.230
<v Speaker 2>doctrine that makes sense of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior.</v>

587
00:35:52.231 --> 00:35:55.080
<v Speaker 2>What I blame religion for and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and likewise,</v>

588
00:35:55.081 --> 00:35:57.960
<v Speaker 2>there is no doctrine in the mirror loss </v>
<v Speaker 2>of religion.</v>

589
00:35:57.961 --> 00:36:02.961
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I atheism that gets you the gulag of </v>

590
00:36:02.961 --> 00:36:05.240
<v Speaker 2>there is that there's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not,</v>

591
00:36:05.241 --> 00:36:06.140
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let me just,</v>

592
00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:08.520
<v Speaker 2>let me just flush out this point for one</v>
<v Speaker 2>more second.</v>

593
00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:13.910
<v Speaker 2>The only thing I blame religion for are </v>
<v Speaker 2>the things that it becomes rational to </v>

594
00:36:14.071 --> 00:36:18.300
<v Speaker 2>do by the light of these beliefs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you accept these doctrines,</v>

595
00:36:18.570 --> 00:36:23.460
<v Speaker 2>a rational and good person can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>tempted to join isis.</v>

596
00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:28.760
<v Speaker 2>That's my concern.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A rational and good person can be </v>

597
00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:28.760
<v Speaker 2>tempted to support the inquisition,</v>

598
00:36:28.990 --> 00:36:31.090
<v Speaker 1>but of the many things they had in </v>
<v Speaker 1>common.</v>

599
00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:36.960
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the point that david berlinski </v>

600
00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:38.791
<v Speaker 1>made in his book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did the end kvd having common with </v>

601
00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:45.030
<v Speaker 1>everyone who oversaw the gulag bss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who guarded the camps,</v>

602
00:36:45.701 --> 00:36:48.670
<v Speaker 1>that people who put people on trains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did they all have in common?</v>

603
00:36:48.671 --> 00:36:52.150
<v Speaker 1>What do they have in common with mao,</v>
<v Speaker 1>among other things they had in common?</v>

604
00:36:52.490 --> 00:36:55.450
<v Speaker 1>The fact that none of them thought that </v>
<v Speaker 1>god was watching them,</v>

605
00:36:56.950 --> 00:36:58.990
<v Speaker 1>none of them thought that they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>being observed.</v>

606
00:36:58.991 --> 00:36:59.180
<v Speaker 1>And what</v>

607
00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:02.150
<v Speaker 2>held accountable?</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't help when you think god is on</v>

608
00:37:02.151 --> 00:37:07.151
<v Speaker 2>your side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we have just as many examples where </v>

609
00:37:07.151 --> 00:37:07.151
<v Speaker 2>people do it because I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>god,</v>

610
00:37:07.151 --> 00:37:08.070
<v Speaker 2>god is on their side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

611
00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:10.100
<v Speaker 2>Watching and clapping.</v>

612
00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:13.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm not denying that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying that the attempt to make this</v>

613
00:37:13.791 --> 00:37:17.350
<v Speaker 1>at a tennis match over the 20th century </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a mistake.</v>

614
00:37:17.351 --> 00:37:19.480
<v Speaker 1>We were still trying to work out what </v>
<v Speaker 1>caused it.</v>

615
00:37:19.481 --> 00:37:21.550
<v Speaker 1>Religion had a role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Atheism had a role,</v>

616
00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:24.900
<v Speaker 1>but the perpetual tennis match of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

617
00:37:24.901 --> 00:37:25.170
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

618
00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:30.070
<v Speaker 4>there is something to be said at a more </v>
<v Speaker 4>sophisticated level,</v>

619
00:37:30.071 --> 00:37:35.071
<v Speaker 4>I would say for the idea that you have </v>
<v Speaker 4>an obligation to a transcendent ethic.</v>

620
00:37:35.410 --> 00:37:38.920
<v Speaker 4>Now you make that claim in the moral </v>
<v Speaker 4>landscape.</v>

621
00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:41.680
<v Speaker 4>You you lay out a transcendent ethic in </v>
<v Speaker 4>my estimation.</v>

622
00:37:41.681 --> 00:37:46.681
<v Speaker 4>That's one that puts the onus of </v>
<v Speaker 4>responsibility on the individual to act </v>

623
00:37:48.671 --> 00:37:53.671
<v Speaker 4>in a way that at at minimum minimizes </v>
<v Speaker 4>suffering and so and you think of that </v>

624
00:37:55.421 --> 00:37:58.570
<v Speaker 4>as a statement of fact that that's the </v>
<v Speaker 4>proper way of being.</v>

625
00:37:58.571 --> 00:38:02.200
<v Speaker 4>And I think aBout it as an axiomatic </v>
<v Speaker 4>statement of faith and that's one of our</v>

626
00:38:02.201 --> 00:38:07.201
<v Speaker 4>differences,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I have been very careful in my </v>

627
00:38:07.201 --> 00:38:11.821
<v Speaker 4>analysis of the relationship between the</v>
<v Speaker 4>idea of sovereignty and the idea of </v>

628
00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:15.490
<v Speaker 4>religious belief,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and one of the things that I have worked</v>

629
00:38:15.491 --> 00:38:20.491
<v Speaker 4>out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think partly from reading such people </v>

630
00:38:20.491 --> 00:38:21.370
<v Speaker 4>as eliana and young,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was that the.</v>

631
00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:26.400
<v Speaker 4>There is an emergent idea of sovereignty</v>
<v Speaker 4>that does involve being accountable to a</v>

632
00:38:26.591 --> 00:38:30.570
<v Speaker 4>god and neighbor here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's how I would justify that and I,</v>

633
00:38:30.571 --> 00:38:35.571
<v Speaker 4>I would think about this essentially </v>
<v Speaker 4>from a practical and biological </v>

634
00:38:35.571 --> 00:38:38.761
<v Speaker 4>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 4>independent of any metaphysical reality </v>

635
00:38:38.761 --> 00:38:38.761
<v Speaker 4>that it might have.</v>

636
00:38:38.761 --> 00:38:40.810
<v Speaker 4>So the ancient mesopotamians,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

637
00:38:41.130 --> 00:38:46.130
<v Speaker 4>believed that their emperor was the </v>
<v Speaker 4>incarnation or the representative of a </v>

638
00:38:46.130 --> 00:38:51.031
<v Speaker 4>god named martin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that actually bestowed certain </v>

639
00:38:51.031 --> 00:38:55.000
<v Speaker 4>ethical responsibilities on the ruler.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the ruler had to Be a good marduk</v>

640
00:38:55.001 --> 00:38:58.480
<v Speaker 4>in order to be a sovereIgn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be regarded as sovereign.</v>

641
00:38:58.481 --> 00:39:02.080
<v Speaker 4>He had to be the embodiment of these </v>
<v Speaker 4>divine principles.</v>

642
00:39:02.081 --> 00:39:06.040
<v Speaker 4>And it took the mesopotamians a very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very long period of time,</v>

643
00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:08.500
<v Speaker 4>perhaps several tens of thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>

644
00:39:08.590 --> 00:39:10.660
<v Speaker 4>They weren't mesopotamian during that </v>
<v Speaker 4>whole time.</v>

645
00:39:10.661 --> 00:39:15.661
<v Speaker 4>Obviously to work out what those </v>
<v Speaker 4>principles of sovereignty should be and </v>

646
00:39:15.661 --> 00:39:19.330
<v Speaker 4>the mesopotamians encoded this in their </v>
<v Speaker 4>fictions and their religious fictions,</v>

647
00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:24.660
<v Speaker 4>making essentially the proposition that </v>
<v Speaker 4>the proper ruler had to have eyes all </v>

648
00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:27.670
<v Speaker 4>the way around his head because that was</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the attributes of martech.</v>

649
00:39:27.671 --> 00:39:30.760
<v Speaker 4>So he was someone who was genuinely </v>
<v Speaker 4>paying attention,</v>

650
00:39:31.330 --> 00:39:35.400
<v Speaker 4>who is capable of coming into voluntary </v>
<v Speaker 4>contact with,</v>

651
00:39:35.690 --> 00:39:40.690
<v Speaker 4>with the great chaotic substructure of </v>
<v Speaker 4>being and cutting it into pieces and </v>

652
00:39:40.690 --> 00:39:45.391
<v Speaker 4>making the habitable world and also </v>
<v Speaker 4>speaking words that were truthful,</v>

653
00:39:45.590 --> 00:39:48.880
<v Speaker 4>that had the power,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the magic power of truth,</v>

654
00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:52.210
<v Speaker 4>and the the ruler had to act that out.</v>

655
00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:57.010
<v Speaker 4>If he was going to be the sort of ruler </v>
<v Speaker 4>that his people weren't entitled to slay</v>

656
00:39:57.011 --> 00:40:02.011
<v Speaker 4>and sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then once a year at the new year's </v>

657
00:40:02.011 --> 00:40:02.350
<v Speaker 4>festival,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he would go outside the city,</v>

658
00:40:02.351 --> 00:40:07.351
<v Speaker 4>the walled city,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he would act out his role of marduk </v>

659
00:40:07.351 --> 00:40:11.010
<v Speaker 4>and the priest would humiliate them and </v>
<v Speaker 4>ask him to confess all the ways that he </v>

660
00:40:11.010 --> 00:40:15.211
<v Speaker 4>hadn't been a good martech so that he </v>
<v Speaker 4>could remember that he had a </v>

661
00:40:15.211 --> 00:40:18.960
<v Speaker 4>responsibility to undertake this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This to embody this relationship with </v>

662
00:40:19.061 --> 00:40:24.061
<v Speaker 4>these divine principles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the thing that's so important about </v>

663
00:40:24.061 --> 00:40:26.761
<v Speaker 4>this so absolutely crucially important </v>
<v Speaker 4>is that it established the principle </v>

664
00:40:26.761 --> 00:40:28.420
<v Speaker 4>that even if you were at the top of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>hierarchy,</v>

665
00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:33.690
<v Speaker 4>you weren't absolute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was something above you that you </v>

666
00:40:33.690 --> 00:40:37.621
<v Speaker 4>were subordinate to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and one of the extraordinarily useful </v>

667
00:40:37.621 --> 00:40:39.730
<v Speaker 4>ideas about the abstraction of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of even god as a personified spirit,</v>

668
00:40:39.731 --> 00:40:44.731
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that it allows every leader to be </v>

669
00:40:44.731 --> 00:40:46.120
<v Speaker 4>subordinate to something that's beyond </v>
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>

670
00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:48.190
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't mean it can't be misused,</v>

671
00:40:48.191 --> 00:40:49.330
<v Speaker 4>but it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>

672
00:40:49.331 --> 00:40:50.800
<v Speaker 4>very important idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

673
00:40:50.801 --> 00:40:51.280
<v Speaker 4>except</v>

674
00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:52.930
<v Speaker 2>you can also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can get there.</v>

675
00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:55.060
<v Speaker 2>The other way around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can realize that you,</v>

676
00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:57.130
<v Speaker 2>even if you're at the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy,</v>

677
00:40:57.670 --> 00:41:01.450
<v Speaker 2>you are radically dependent on everyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

678
00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:07.040
<v Speaker 2>That the tip of the pyramid at the tip </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a hierarchy doesn't believe that </v>

679
00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:08.650
<v Speaker 2>sometimes they believe they can do </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the hell they want.</v>

680
00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:14.250
<v Speaker 2>But I'm saying if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to believe something </v>

681
00:41:14.250 --> 00:41:17.460
<v Speaker 2>that's compatible with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with rationality globally and has the </v>

682
00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:19.390
<v Speaker 2>least conceivable downside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would put in that place,</v>

683
00:41:19.391 --> 00:41:24.391
<v Speaker 2>not a superstitious attachment to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>notion of an invisible friend,</v>

684
00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:26.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or punisher who's,</v>

685
00:41:26.810 --> 00:41:31.810
<v Speaker 2>who's above you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would put in its place they totally </v>

686
00:41:31.810 --> 00:41:35.080
<v Speaker 2>defensible and palpably true fact that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

687
00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:37.630
<v Speaker 2>that you can be the king of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>

688
00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:41.630
<v Speaker 2>of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you are dependent on everyone around</v>

689
00:41:41.631 --> 00:41:44.660
<v Speaker 2>you to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to not be murdered by them.</v>

690
00:41:44.661 --> 00:41:46.130
<v Speaker 2>I mean like you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are,</v>

691
00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:47.660
<v Speaker 2>you are.</v>

692
00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:48.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing.</v>

693
00:41:48.981 --> 00:41:53.981
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing how precarious even a </v>
<v Speaker 2>totalitarian regime is.</v>

694
00:41:56.511 --> 00:41:57.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the amazing thing is that,</v>

695
00:41:57.910 --> 00:41:59.690
<v Speaker 2>that these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last at all,</v>

696
00:41:59.691 --> 00:42:04.691
<v Speaker 2>because in many cases it would just take</v>
<v Speaker 2>a 50 people to act in unison to kill the</v>

697
00:42:04.851 --> 00:42:05.840
<v Speaker 2>tyrant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

698
00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:09.350
<v Speaker 2>But it never happens because we either </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a first mover problem.</v>

699
00:42:09.351 --> 00:42:11.480
<v Speaker 2>Everyone is afraid to be the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>person shot.</v>

700
00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:16.900
<v Speaker 2>But it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is a genuine mystery that these </v>

701
00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:17.270
<v Speaker 2>systems even perpetuate themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when they unravel,</v>

702
00:42:17.271 --> 00:42:18.220
<v Speaker 2>when you see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

703
00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:23.000
<v Speaker 2>kadafi being murdered in a crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you realize,</v>

704
00:42:23.001 --> 00:42:28.001
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really is just a matter of the </v>

705
00:42:28.001 --> 00:42:30.491
<v Speaker 2>restraint and fear of human beings </v>
<v Speaker 2>keeping any of these things together.</v>

706
00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:31.920
<v Speaker 2>A benign,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

707
00:42:31.921 --> 00:42:36.921
<v Speaker 2>if you wanted a hierarchy where you had </v>
<v Speaker 2>a kind of benign philosopher king </v>

708
00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:39.890
<v Speaker 2>pulling the reigns of a society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying we do,</v>

709
00:42:39.891 --> 00:42:43.160
<v Speaker 2>but even there you could have an ethical</v>
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

710
00:42:43.161 --> 00:42:48.161
<v Speaker 2>You could have one where and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a non superstitious one was the one </v>

711
00:42:48.161 --> 00:42:48.380
<v Speaker 2>where someone recognize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

712
00:42:48.381 --> 00:42:50.000
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is how we're doing it,</v>

713
00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:53.060
<v Speaker 2>but we are radically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I at the top of this hierarchy,</v>

714
00:42:53.061 --> 00:42:58.061
<v Speaker 2>am radically dependent on having,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being surrounded by as many happy people</v>

715
00:42:58.641 --> 00:43:00.930
<v Speaker 2>as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well</v>

716
00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:03.520
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean I don't,</v>

717
00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:05.780
<v Speaker 6>I don't in some profound sense</v>

718
00:43:06.810 --> 00:43:07.480
<v Speaker 2>we're actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

719
00:43:07.630 --> 00:43:09.640
<v Speaker 2>we're living in this sounds like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fiction,</v>

720
00:43:09.641 --> 00:43:12.490
<v Speaker 2>but we're living with this problem and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we encounter this more and more when you</v>

721
00:43:12.491 --> 00:43:13.700
<v Speaker 2>talk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

722
00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:15.520
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in silicon valley as,</v>

723
00:43:15.521 --> 00:43:18.130
<v Speaker 2>as you and I occasionally do and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>sure you do as well,</v>

724
00:43:18.131 --> 00:43:21.880
<v Speaker 2>where you meet people who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>fantastically wealthy,</v>

725
00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:27.360
<v Speaker 2>who seem uncannily detached at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the detached,</v>

726
00:43:29.650 --> 00:43:34.650
<v Speaker 2>at the fact that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this growing chasm between them </v>

727
00:43:34.650 --> 00:43:39.361
<v Speaker 2>and those they know and the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 2>humanity and one begins to wonder what </v>

728
00:43:40.090 --> 00:43:44.650
<v Speaker 2>level of wealth inequality will everyone</v>
<v Speaker 2>find alarming.</v>

729
00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:49.950
<v Speaker 2>And some people are acting as though </v>
<v Speaker 2>there is no level that is alarming that </v>

730
00:43:49.950 --> 00:43:53.791
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's kind of a law of nature </v>

731
00:43:53.791 --> 00:43:55.561
<v Speaker 2>that this thing can grow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just impossibly to the point where we </v>

732
00:43:55.631 --> 00:43:58.180
<v Speaker 2>have trillionaires walking around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

733
00:43:58.181 --> 00:44:01.870
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you drive into their motorcades and it's</v>

734
00:44:01.871 --> 00:44:06.871
<v Speaker 2>kind of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's sort of the libertarian </v>

735
00:44:06.871 --> 00:44:08.551
<v Speaker 2>religion one occasionally runs into a </v>
<v Speaker 2>and clearly there's some level of </v>

736
00:44:08.551 --> 00:44:12.010
<v Speaker 2>inequality that's untenable or at least </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be undesirable.</v>

737
00:44:13.110 --> 00:44:18.110
<v Speaker 6>It's a funny thing because that's a </v>
<v Speaker 6>place where our thought loops and then </v>

738
00:44:18.110 --> 00:44:21.471
<v Speaker 6>agrees to some degree again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because I do believe that you can in </v>

739
00:44:21.541 --> 00:44:26.541
<v Speaker 6>some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 6>rationally derive an an ethic.</v>

740
00:44:27.390 --> 00:44:28.290
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so let's,</v>

741
00:44:28.350 --> 00:44:33.350
<v Speaker 6>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let's take the argument that you put </v>

742
00:44:33.350 --> 00:44:33.350
<v Speaker 6>forward.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Say that,</v>

743
00:44:33.350 --> 00:44:34.490
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're,</v>

744
00:44:34.690 --> 00:44:37.440
<v Speaker 6>and this is an extension of your </v>
<v Speaker 6>wellbeing argument to some degree,</v>

745
00:44:37.441 --> 00:44:39.390
<v Speaker 6>which with which I've thought about a </v>
<v Speaker 6>fair bit.</v>

746
00:44:39.391 --> 00:44:40.080
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

747
00:44:41.010 --> 00:44:43.440
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what's the optimal solution for you?</v>

748
00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:45.090
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

749
00:44:45.091 --> 00:44:50.070
<v Speaker 6>well first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there isn't just you now there's you now</v>

750
00:44:50.071 --> 00:44:54.150
<v Speaker 6>and you tomorrow and you next week and </v>
<v Speaker 6>you and a year you in five years.</v>

751
00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:57.330
<v Speaker 6>So there's you and the you that </v>
<v Speaker 6>propagates across time.</v>

752
00:44:57.780 --> 00:45:01.860
<v Speaker 6>So one of the implications of that is </v>
<v Speaker 6>that you can't do anything that's really</v>

753
00:45:01.861 --> 00:45:05.160
<v Speaker 6>good for the eu now that isn't very good</v>
<v Speaker 6>for you a week from now.</v>

754
00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:06.060
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

755
00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:11.270
<v Speaker 6>So that means you have to imagine </v>
<v Speaker 6>yourself as multiple individuals across </v>

756
00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:15.501
<v Speaker 6>multiple timeframes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then you have to figure out what's </v>

757
00:45:15.501 --> 00:45:16.080
<v Speaker 6>good for all those individuals across </v>
<v Speaker 6>all those timeframes.</v>

758
00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:20.310
<v Speaker 6>Although you discount the future to some</v>
<v Speaker 6>degree because of its unpredictability.</v>

759
00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:25.520
<v Speaker 6>But then so,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so that's a very tIght set of </v>

760
00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:25.520
<v Speaker 6>constraints and you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

761
00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:28.080
<v Speaker 6>a rational person would calculate the </v>
<v Speaker 6>optimal across all those,</v>

762
00:45:28.170 --> 00:45:33.170
<v Speaker 6>all those multiple timeframes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then you do the same thing with other </v>

763
00:45:33.170 --> 00:45:34.230
<v Speaker 6>people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is the point you just made.</v>

764
00:45:34.231 --> 00:45:36.360
<v Speaker 6>Well it isn't just you because who's </v>
<v Speaker 6>you.</v>

765
00:45:36.361 --> 00:45:41.361
<v Speaker 6>There's you and your family.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Most people are in a situation where </v>

766
00:45:41.361 --> 00:45:45.830
<v Speaker 6>they would regard damage to theIr family</v>
<v Speaker 6>as perhaps even worse than damage to </v>

767
00:45:45.830 --> 00:45:49.911
<v Speaker 6>them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So whatever they are obviously </v>

768
00:45:49.911 --> 00:45:52.491
<v Speaker 6>encapsulates their family and then to </v>
<v Speaker 6>some degree that flows off into the </v>

769
00:45:52.491 --> 00:45:55.701
<v Speaker 6>community and so there is no isolated </v>
<v Speaker 6>you and that sort of point with regards </v>

770
00:45:55.701 --> 00:45:55.920
<v Speaker 6>to the ethic.</v>

771
00:45:56.070 --> 00:45:58.230
<v Speaker 6>But then so,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so I agree with all that.</v>

772
00:45:58.231 --> 00:46:03.231
<v Speaker 6>But then one of the things that I would </v>
<v Speaker 6>suggest is that because that's an </v>

773
00:46:03.231 --> 00:46:07.761
<v Speaker 6>incredibly difficult rational </v>
<v Speaker 6>calculation and perhaps an impossible </v>

774
00:46:07.761 --> 00:46:09.630
<v Speaker 6>one technically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but certainly very difficult.</v>

775
00:46:09.930 --> 00:46:13.170
<v Speaker 6>That's what that what has happened in </v>
<v Speaker 6>part as our,</v>

776
00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:16.710
<v Speaker 6>as our great narratives have heavy </v>
<v Speaker 6>merged across time,</v>

777
00:46:16.711 --> 00:46:21.711
<v Speaker 6>is that we have observed ourself </v>
<v Speaker 6>attempting to solve that multiple </v>

778
00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:24.510
<v Speaker 6>identity,</v>
<v Speaker 6>multiple timeframe problem.</v>

779
00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:29.010
<v Speaker 6>And we've told stories about people who </v>
<v Speaker 6>do that exceptionally well,</v>

780
00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:34.160
<v Speaker 6>and then we've winnowed out those </v>
<v Speaker 6>stories and we've produced these </v>

781
00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:35.460
<v Speaker 6>powerful narratives that encapsulate the</v>
<v Speaker 6>ethic,</v>

782
00:46:35.461 --> 00:46:39.150
<v Speaker 6>that does in fact reflect that wisdom </v>
<v Speaker 6>and so,</v>

783
00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:44.180
<v Speaker 6>so,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I think you actually accept some of </v>

784
00:46:44.180 --> 00:46:44.460
<v Speaker 6>that in your,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in your moral propositions,</v>

785
00:46:44.461 --> 00:46:46.350
<v Speaker 6>which is something that we've talked </v>
<v Speaker 6>about before.</v>

786
00:46:46.351 --> 00:46:48.450
<v Speaker 6>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they'll never really agreed on.</v>

787
00:46:48.930 --> 00:46:50.790
<v Speaker 6>You certainly believe,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for example,</v>

788
00:46:50.791 --> 00:46:55.791
<v Speaker 6>that the embodiment of truth is one of </v>
<v Speaker 6>the means whereby you solve the problem </v>

789
00:46:56.611 --> 00:47:01.611
<v Speaker 6>of ethics.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I would say that that's a deeply </v>

790
00:47:01.611 --> 00:47:02.440
<v Speaker 6>rooted,</v>
<v Speaker 6>judeo christian concept that that well</v>

791
00:47:03.730 --> 00:47:08.730
<v Speaker 2>rooted that it proceeds any notion of </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious provincialism.</v>

792
00:47:08.891 --> 00:47:09.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

793
00:47:09.431 --> 00:47:14.431
<v Speaker 2>it's deeper than judeo christian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's deeper than our humanity on some </v>

794
00:47:14.431 --> 00:47:18.061
<v Speaker 2>level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At one point we talked about the golden </v>

795
00:47:18.061 --> 00:47:18.061
<v Speaker 2>rule and I said that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the,</v>

796
00:47:18.061 --> 00:47:20.950
<v Speaker 2>the precursor to the golden rule can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>found even among monkeys.</v>

797
00:47:21.010 --> 00:47:26.010
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the golden rule is the rule for </v>

798
00:47:26.010 --> 00:47:26.010
<v Speaker 2>monkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

799
00:47:26.010 --> 00:47:26.010
<v Speaker 2>exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

800
00:47:26.590 --> 00:47:28.660
<v Speaker 2>Let me just add to the picture you </v>
<v Speaker 2>sketched out.</v>

801
00:47:28.661 --> 00:47:29.800
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with.</v>

802
00:47:29.801 --> 00:47:34.801
<v Speaker 2>We have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have an ethical obligation even to </v>

803
00:47:34.801 --> 00:47:34.990
<v Speaker 2>our future selves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

804
00:47:34.991 --> 00:47:36.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean we are in relationship to who we </v>
<v Speaker 2>will,</v>

805
00:47:36.670 --> 00:47:41.670
<v Speaker 2>who's going to be the person who is </v>
<v Speaker 2>drinking his fourth scotch tonight will </v>

806
00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:46.081
<v Speaker 2>be had some ethical relationship to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>person who's going to wake up with a </v>

807
00:47:46.081 --> 00:47:49.681
<v Speaker 2>hangover tomorrow morning and and one </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing we know for sure in which we have </v>

808
00:47:50.651 --> 00:47:55.060
<v Speaker 2>begun to deeply understand that </v>
<v Speaker 2>described scientifically as w we are bad</v>

809
00:47:55.090 --> 00:47:56.910
<v Speaker 2>at all of these calculations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

810
00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:58.930
<v Speaker 2>Like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hyperbolic discounting,</v>

811
00:47:58.931 --> 00:47:59.890
<v Speaker 2>a future rewards.</v>

812
00:48:00.290 --> 00:48:03.860
<v Speaker 6>That's also why I think we have these </v>
<v Speaker 6>stringent limitations on rationality.</v>

813
00:48:03.861 --> 00:48:08.861
<v Speaker 6>Sap,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is that we can't solve the problem </v>

814
00:48:08.861 --> 00:48:08.861
<v Speaker 6>through calculation.</v>

815
00:48:08.861 --> 00:48:08.861
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

816
00:48:08.861 --> 00:48:12.781
<v Speaker 2>but we we increasingly can and and even </v>
<v Speaker 2>where it's best summarized not by </v>

817
00:48:13.481 --> 00:48:18.481
<v Speaker 2>capital.</v>
<v Speaker 2>ONe thing I'll grant you is that it's </v>

818
00:48:18.481 --> 00:48:20.851
<v Speaker 2>not always best conveyed or rendered </v>
<v Speaker 2>Indelible and actionable by being being </v>

819
00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:25.300
<v Speaker 2>given a nature paper or an abstract </v>
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>

820
00:48:25.350 --> 00:48:28.690
<v Speaker 2>from a paper in the literature and being</v>
<v Speaker 2>told,</v>

821
00:48:28.750 --> 00:48:31.450
<v Speaker 2>this is the way you want to behave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to maximize your wellbeing.</v>

822
00:48:31.780 --> 00:48:36.780
<v Speaker 2>It may best be conveyed by certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>stories or certain books that are that </v>

823
00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:38.080
<v Speaker 2>are in the philosophy section of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bookstore,</v>

824
00:48:38.081 --> 00:48:40.830
<v Speaker 2>not the science section and but you </v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't.</v>

825
00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:45.840
<v Speaker 2>You and I were at the book signing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other night and someone came up with </v>

826
00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:47.650
<v Speaker 2>with a copy of the meditations of marcus</v>
<v Speaker 2>aurelius.</v>

827
00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:51.760
<v Speaker 2>Write a fantastic book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so much wisdom in that book,</v>

828
00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:54.850
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's nothing about stoning a girl</v>

829
00:48:54.851 --> 00:48:56.860
<v Speaker 2>to death if she's not a virgin on her </v>
<v Speaker 2>wedding day.</v>

830
00:48:57.400 --> 00:49:02.400
<v Speaker 2>Now we all recognize that marcus </v>
<v Speaker 2>aurelius was a human being who wrote </v>

831
00:49:03.701 --> 00:49:08.701
<v Speaker 2>this book and that that provenance is no</v>
<v Speaker 2>barrier to take in the book deadly </v>

832
00:49:12.701 --> 00:49:15.100
<v Speaker 2>seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an incredibly useful book.</v>

833
00:49:15.101 --> 00:49:20.101
<v Speaker 2>And stoicism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stoicism could be the quote religion or </v>

834
00:49:20.231 --> 00:49:22.600
<v Speaker 2>the guiding philosophy of the west.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could,</v>

835
00:49:22.601 --> 00:49:27.601
<v Speaker 2>it would be a much better one than </v>
<v Speaker 2>judaism or christianity and and as have </v>

836
00:49:27.601 --> 00:49:29.620
<v Speaker 2>none,</v>
<v Speaker 2>virtually none of the downside.</v>

837
00:49:29.970 --> 00:49:31.550
<v Speaker 2>and so that's my point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we're,</v>

838
00:49:31.551 --> 00:49:36.551
<v Speaker 2>we're in this perverse circumstance of </v>
<v Speaker 2>being held hostage by certain products </v>

839
00:49:38.981 --> 00:49:40.030
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of literature,</v>

840
00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:43.780
<v Speaker 2>and we need to break the spell and if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

841
00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:49.080
<v Speaker 2>if we're finding it this hard to break,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do we think is gonna happen in the </v>

842
00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:51.170
<v Speaker 2>middle east or in subsaharan africa?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we,</v>

843
00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:51.760
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

844
00:49:52.330 --> 00:49:57.330
<v Speaker 2>the moral progress we need to engineer </v>
<v Speaker 2>is a common humanity coming together.</v>

845
00:49:57.611 --> 00:49:57.790
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

846
00:49:58.350 --> 00:50:01.620
<v Speaker 6>Shared values are.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Those are perfectly credible arguments.</v>

847
00:50:01.621 --> 00:50:05.370
<v Speaker 6>But the weakness in the argument I think</v>
<v Speaker 6>is the one that we started to talk about</v>

848
00:50:05.371 --> 00:50:10.371
<v Speaker 6>earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is that when you talked with dave </v>

849
00:50:10.371 --> 00:50:11.850
<v Speaker 6>rubin and while back and michael shermer</v>
<v Speaker 6>said the same thing recently,</v>

850
00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:14.710
<v Speaker 6>he,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he basically said that atheism is a,</v>

851
00:50:14.770 --> 00:50:19.770
<v Speaker 6>is a doctrine of negation.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what you said with ruben is that </v>

852
00:50:19.770 --> 00:50:21.330
<v Speaker 6>there isn't that positive ethos in </v>
<v Speaker 6>atheism.</v>

853
00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:25.900
<v Speaker 6>All it says is that there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's nothinG persona,</v>

854
00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:29.600
<v Speaker 6>there's nothing transcendent.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's something like that.</v>

855
00:50:29.601 --> 00:50:34.601
<v Speaker 6>There is no god.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so and so the problem with the </v>

856
00:50:34.601 --> 00:50:34.601
<v Speaker 6>atheist,</v>

857
00:50:34.601 --> 00:50:36.400
<v Speaker 2>it's not even the assertion that there </v>
<v Speaker 2>is no god,</v>

858
00:50:36.401 --> 00:50:41.260
<v Speaker 2>it's just that it's a failure to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>convinced by any of the gods on offer.</v>

859
00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:43.380
<v Speaker 2>It's just like not believing in zoos,</v>

860
00:50:43.490 --> 00:50:45.090
<v Speaker 6>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it's not like it's a week.</v>

861
00:50:45.091 --> 00:50:50.091
<v Speaker 6>It's not like it's a weak argument.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean I'm perfectly aware of that </v>

862
00:50:50.091 --> 00:50:53.390
<v Speaker 6>making a day istick case or a case for </v>
<v Speaker 6>religion in the face of the claims of </v>

863
00:50:53.390 --> 00:50:55.890
<v Speaker 6>the rationalist atheist is perhaps while</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a very,</v>

864
00:50:55.891 --> 00:51:00.450
<v Speaker 6>very difficult thing to manage.</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it is also the case that.</v>

865
00:51:00.510 --> 00:51:05.510
<v Speaker 6>And this is where I think we differ with</v>
<v Speaker 6>regards to what happened say in the </v>

866
00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:07.410
<v Speaker 6>soviet union and perhaps to to also in </v>
<v Speaker 6>nazi Germany,</v>

867
00:51:07.411 --> 00:51:09.420
<v Speaker 6>is that when,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when,</v>

868
00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:10.440
<v Speaker 6>when,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when,</v>

869
00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:15.950
<v Speaker 6>when your doctrine demolishes the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's called it the literary or </v>

870
00:51:16.651 --> 00:51:21.651
<v Speaker 6>fictional substructure and leaves,</v>
<v Speaker 6>nothing behind an esco.</v>

871
00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:26.070
<v Speaker 6>An ethos needs to be provided because </v>
<v Speaker 6>something will rush in to fill the void.</v>

872
00:51:26.430 --> 00:51:29.130
<v Speaker 6>And it certainly the case,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and this is what niche you warned about,</v>

873
00:51:29.131 --> 00:51:34.131
<v Speaker 6>even though he was a strident </v>
<v Speaker 6>antichristian and it's also what </v>

874
00:51:34.131 --> 00:51:34.131
<v Speaker 6>dostoevsky first saw.</v>

875
00:51:34.131 --> 00:51:38.060
<v Speaker 6>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if we knock out the logos from the </v>

876
00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:41.630
<v Speaker 6>substructure of western society and we </v>
<v Speaker 6>need you to believe that it was </v>

877
00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:45.060
<v Speaker 6>christianity's emphasis on truth that </v>
<v Speaker 6>destroyed christianity,</v>

878
00:51:45.061 --> 00:51:47.670
<v Speaker 6>which was an extremely interesting </v>
<v Speaker 6>criticism.</v>

879
00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:52.700
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>christianity had been elevated to truth </v>

880
00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:55.671
<v Speaker 6>to such a degree that it would.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It actually resulted in the demolition </v>

881
00:51:55.671 --> 00:51:59.451
<v Speaker 6>of its own dogmatic substructure,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but be that as it made niches </v>

882
00:51:59.451 --> 00:52:03.320
<v Speaker 6>prognostication was that if we allowed </v>
<v Speaker 6>god to die and perhaps there are reasons</v>

883
00:52:03.661 --> 00:52:06.200
<v Speaker 6>for that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that the consequence would be that would</v>

884
00:52:06.270 --> 00:52:11.270
<v Speaker 6>be we would be awash in both nihilism </v>
<v Speaker 6>and totalitarian bloodshed and that is </v>

885
00:52:11.281 --> 00:52:13.110
<v Speaker 6>what happened in the 20th century and</v>

886
00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:18.750
<v Speaker 1>so and there's another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's another aspect to that which is </v>

887
00:52:18.750 --> 00:52:20.690
<v Speaker 1>what you made you made trying to knock </v>
<v Speaker 1>out the whole thing.</v>

888
00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:23.090
<v Speaker 1>Take out some of the substructure but </v>
<v Speaker 1>not the whole thinG.</v>

889
00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:25.670
<v Speaker 1>That's what nature also showed that his </v>
<v Speaker 1>prediction,</v>

890
00:52:25.671 --> 00:52:30.671
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's blindinGly obviously </v>
<v Speaker 1>true that you might end this post </v>

891
00:52:30.671 --> 00:52:33.950
<v Speaker 1>christian era,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a reminisce of christianity such as</v>

892
00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:36.660
<v Speaker 1>guilt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>overbearing,</v>

893
00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:40.250
<v Speaker 1>guilt and no means of alleviation or </v>
<v Speaker 1>redemption,</v>

894
00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:44.040
<v Speaker 6>which is actually part of the problem of</v>
<v Speaker 6>protestantism by the way because it's,</v>

895
00:52:44.290 --> 00:52:45.010
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

896
00:52:45.020 --> 00:52:50.020
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and there are other things too that it </v>

897
00:52:50.020 --> 00:52:51.831
<v Speaker 6>seemed to be,</v>
<v Speaker 6>seemed to be fundamental religious </v>

898
00:52:51.831 --> 00:52:52.260
<v Speaker 6>issues that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that secular,</v>

899
00:52:52.410 --> 00:52:54.600
<v Speaker 6>I think have a difficult time accounting</v>
<v Speaker 6>for it.</v>

900
00:52:54.601 --> 00:52:59.601
<v Speaker 6>It'S like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so you actually have to grapple </v>

901
00:52:59.601 --> 00:53:02.751
<v Speaker 6>serIously with the problem that a </v>
<v Speaker 6>doctrine that's essentially one of </v>

902
00:53:02.751 --> 00:53:04.260
<v Speaker 6>negation doesn't offer a positive ethos </v>
<v Speaker 6>and now,</v>

903
00:53:04.261 --> 00:53:06.720
<v Speaker 6>and you are doing now to be perfectly </v>
<v Speaker 6>fair,</v>

904
00:53:06.721 --> 00:53:11.721
<v Speaker 6>you said that reading a nature paper </v>
<v Speaker 6>about the necessity of calculating your </v>

905
00:53:12.301 --> 00:53:16.350
<v Speaker 6>ethic across multiple,</v>
<v Speaker 6>multiple timeframes and multiple persons</v>

906
00:53:16.470 --> 00:53:21.470
<v Speaker 6>doesn't have the motive force that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>going to drive you to act ethically and </v>

907
00:53:21.470 --> 00:53:22.110
<v Speaker 6>life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I do believe that's true,</v>

908
00:53:22.111 --> 00:53:26.190
<v Speaker 6>but I think the fact that the ethos</v>

909
00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:31.020
<v Speaker 5>doesn't have motivational push is </v>
<v Speaker 5>actually a fatal flaw.</v>

910
00:53:31.050 --> 00:53:36.050
<v Speaker 5>They don't meet every week to read </v>
<v Speaker 5>marcus aurelius music.</v>

911
00:53:36.930 --> 00:53:38.820
<v Speaker 5>There's no music that goes along with </v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

912
00:53:38.821 --> 00:53:43.821
<v Speaker 5>there's no art that goes along with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no architecture that goes along </v>

913
00:53:43.821 --> 00:53:43.821
<v Speaker 5>with it like,</v>

914
00:53:45.220 --> 00:53:50.220
<v Speaker 2>but to be fair to the present,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most music and mozart and most </v>

915
00:53:50.220 --> 00:53:53.731
<v Speaker 2>architecture is no longer religious that</v>
<v Speaker 2>is flown the perch provided by religion </v>

916
00:53:54.970 --> 00:53:59.970
<v Speaker 2>traditionally and most of what we care </v>
<v Speaker 2>about in increasingly cosmopolitan and </v>

917
00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:07.800
<v Speaker 2>secular societies is not tied to </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion in any direct way and there's </v>

918
00:54:09.310 --> 00:54:14.310
<v Speaker 2>even whole religions like judaism where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to look long and hard to find </v>

919
00:54:14.310 --> 00:54:16.420
<v Speaker 2>anyone who believes much of anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is religious,</v>

920
00:54:16.590 --> 00:54:21.590
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have literally sat on stage debating </v>

921
00:54:21.590 --> 00:54:24.350
<v Speaker 2>what I thought was a religious rabbi who</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a conservative rabbi and when I,</v>

922
00:54:24.690 --> 00:54:29.690
<v Speaker 2>when I said something that assume that </v>
<v Speaker 2>he believed in a god who could hear our </v>

923
00:54:29.690 --> 00:54:30.070
<v Speaker 2>prayers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he threw up his hands and he said,</v>

924
00:54:30.071 --> 00:54:35.071
<v Speaker 2>what makes you think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe in a god who can hear prayers </v>

925
00:54:35.071 --> 00:54:35.071
<v Speaker 2>and I was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

926
00:54:35.071 --> 00:54:37.180
<v Speaker 2>I practically lost the debate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just be in,</v>

927
00:54:37.181 --> 00:54:39.070
<v Speaker 2>in my astonishment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

928
00:54:41.550 --> 00:54:43.840
<v Speaker 2>what does it mean to be a conservative </v>
<v Speaker 2>rabbi in this case?</v>

929
00:54:44.260 --> 00:54:49.260
<v Speaker 2>There are religions that have made that </v>
<v Speaker 2>transition to a,</v>

930
00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:54.360
<v Speaker 2>an increasingly attenuated commitment to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the truth of the doctrine and there are </v>

931
00:54:56.231 --> 00:54:59.200
<v Speaker 2>religions who haven't moved an inch </v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

932
00:54:59.270 --> 00:55:00.120
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

933
00:55:00.190 --> 00:55:03.290
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think we have to acknowledge that,</v>

934
00:55:03.940 --> 00:55:08.940
<v Speaker 2>that this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this movement in this direction is </v>

935
00:55:08.940 --> 00:55:12.151
<v Speaker 2>progress because what it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it actually is at bottom is </v>

936
00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:18.400
<v Speaker 2>increasing sensitivity to the difference</v>
<v Speaker 2>between having good reasons and bad </v>

937
00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:20.020
<v Speaker 2>reasons for what you believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

938
00:55:20.021 --> 00:55:21.580
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the fact that the,</v>

939
00:55:21.620 --> 00:55:24.340
<v Speaker 2>that this book has been around forever </v>
<v Speaker 2>is not a good reason.</v>

940
00:55:24.670 --> 00:55:26.300
<v Speaker 2>The fact that mommy told me so</v>

941
00:55:26.370 --> 00:55:27.660
<v Speaker 5>well it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's actually,</v>

942
00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:32.920
<v Speaker 5>it's not a terrible reason though </v>
<v Speaker 5>because the fact that something has </v>

943
00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:36.591
<v Speaker 5>lasted for that length of time at least </v>
<v Speaker 5>makes the fact that it's lasted a </v>

944
00:55:36.591 --> 00:55:40.881
<v Speaker 5>mystery and you can't just attribute </v>
<v Speaker 5>that to casual politicking or economic </v>

945
00:55:40.881 --> 00:55:41.630
<v Speaker 5>circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's,</v>

946
00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:46.670
<v Speaker 5>there's something at look you can say </v>
<v Speaker 5>about many of the biblical stories is </v>

947
00:55:47.611 --> 00:55:52.611
<v Speaker 5>that they're incredibly memorable and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that means that in some sense they're </v>

948
00:55:52.611 --> 00:55:53.960
<v Speaker 5>adapted to the memory structures.</v>

949
00:55:54.650 --> 00:55:56.930
<v Speaker 2>So is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mythology of ancient Greece.</v>

950
00:55:56.990 --> 00:55:58.250
<v Speaker 2>It's incredibly memorable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

951
00:55:58.440 --> 00:56:03.440
<v Speaker 2>but I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't all those gods or did the </v>

952
00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:05.400
<v Speaker 2>stories still can be useful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the god fear bibs on,</v>

953
00:56:05.450 --> 00:56:09.020
<v Speaker 2>let's say it lives on in a way that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>benign.</v>

954
00:56:09.050 --> 00:56:13.790
<v Speaker 2>It lives on in a way where you learn </v>
<v Speaker 2>about them in mythology class,</v>

955
00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:15.260
<v Speaker 2>in school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

956
00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:20.280
<v Speaker 2>You don't have it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have a fear of hades drummed </v>

957
00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:21.230
<v Speaker 2>into you as a child by your parents.</v>

958
00:56:21.550 --> 00:56:24.130
<v Speaker 5>The other thing that is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as far as I can</v>

959
00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:27.550
<v Speaker 6>tell in the rationalist doctrine,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and this is something that I've observed</v>

960
00:56:27.551 --> 00:56:31.300
<v Speaker 6>in my clinical practice,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and so one of the things that's happened</v>

961
00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:34.210
<v Speaker 6>over the last years that I've had many </v>
<v Speaker 6>people,</v>

962
00:56:34.211 --> 00:56:39.211
<v Speaker 6>especially ex soldiers,</v>
<v Speaker 6>come to my lecturers who have </v>

963
00:56:39.211 --> 00:56:42.130
<v Speaker 6>posttraumatic stress disorder and they </v>
<v Speaker 6>say that listening to my lectures,</v>

964
00:56:42.131 --> 00:56:44.500
<v Speaker 6>especially the ones on good evil and </v>
<v Speaker 6>tragedy.</v>

965
00:56:44.501 --> 00:56:47.500
<v Speaker 6>There's a partIcular lecture that I </v>
<v Speaker 6>suppose you might be.</v>

966
00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:52.800
<v Speaker 6>You might think about as devoted to </v>
<v Speaker 6>people who have posttraumatIc stress </v>

967
00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:55.651
<v Speaker 6>disorder and that the language of good </v>
<v Speaker 6>and evil that I lay out in those </v>

968
00:56:55.651 --> 00:57:00.121
<v Speaker 6>lectures is actually what allows them to</v>
<v Speaker 6>recover from the posttraumatic stress </v>

969
00:57:00.121 --> 00:57:02.350
<v Speaker 6>disorder and dealing with people like </v>
<v Speaker 6>that in my clinical practice.</v>

970
00:57:02.530 --> 00:57:07.530
<v Speaker 6>The same thing as being the case.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If we can't transcend the language of </v>

971
00:57:07.530 --> 00:57:11.860
<v Speaker 6>the merely rational and move into an </v>
<v Speaker 6>intense conversation about good and evil</v>

972
00:57:11.861 --> 00:57:13.990
<v Speaker 6>in some senses,</v>
<v Speaker 6>metaphysical realities.</v>

973
00:57:14.260 --> 00:57:18.040
<v Speaker 6>We can't enter a realm of seriousness,</v>
<v Speaker 6>conceptual seriousness,</v>

974
00:57:18.310 --> 00:57:23.310
<v Speaker 6>that's of sufficient depth to help heal </v>
<v Speaker 6>someone who's been touched by </v>

975
00:57:23.310 --> 00:57:27.601
<v Speaker 6>malevolence because that actually is </v>
<v Speaker 6>what happens to people with </v>

976
00:57:27.601 --> 00:57:29.770
<v Speaker 6>posttraumatic stress disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is that inevitably the reason that there</v>

977
00:57:29.771 --> 00:57:33.550
<v Speaker 6>are so shattered isn't because something</v>
<v Speaker 6>tragic has happened to them.</v>

978
00:57:33.551 --> 00:57:37.840
<v Speaker 6>Although that does happen upon occasion.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's because someone malevolent has made</v>

979
00:57:37.841 --> 00:57:42.280
<v Speaker 6>contact with them and sometimes that </v>
<v Speaker 6>malevolent being let's say,</v>

980
00:57:42.281 --> 00:57:45.400
<v Speaker 6>or blunt force or spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for lack of a better word,</v>

981
00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:50.640
<v Speaker 6>is something that resides within them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so there we have these lImits on </v>

982
00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:55.261
<v Speaker 6>rational did.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the reason I'm making this cases </v>

983
00:57:55.261 --> 00:57:55.261
<v Speaker 6>because we've already identified another</v>
<v Speaker 6>limit of rational discourse.</v>

984
00:57:55.261 --> 00:58:00.241
<v Speaker 6>It's like it doesn't have the motivating</v>
<v Speaker 6>power of great fiction and great </v>

985
00:58:00.281 --> 00:58:05.281
<v Speaker 6>literature and great poetry,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it also doesn't have the healing </v>

986
00:58:05.281 --> 00:58:08.491
<v Speaker 6>power of language that that takes the </v>
<v Speaker 6>ethical realm to it's extreme in some </v>

987
00:58:09.221 --> 00:58:11.880
<v Speaker 6>sense and and then the next problem </v>
<v Speaker 6>without,</v>

988
00:58:11.890 --> 00:58:13.930
<v Speaker 6>and this is something that douglass has </v>
<v Speaker 6>been,</v>

989
00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:17.050
<v Speaker 6>has been contemplating,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would say,</v>

990
00:58:17.530 --> 00:58:22.530
<v Speaker 6>is that what?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What evidence do we have that a merely </v>

991
00:58:22.571 --> 00:58:27.571
<v Speaker 6>secular representation,</v>
<v Speaker 6>irrational representation of our ethic </v>

992
00:58:27.571 --> 00:58:30.340
<v Speaker 6>is going to provide us with a motive </v>
<v Speaker 6>force that would be sufficient for us to</v>

993
00:58:30.341 --> 00:58:35.341
<v Speaker 6>do such things as identify what's </v>
<v Speaker 6>valuable about our culture and be </v>

994
00:58:35.341 --> 00:58:40.051
<v Speaker 6>motivated to sufficiently protected </v>
<v Speaker 6>assuming that there's something worthy </v>

995
00:58:40.051 --> 00:58:40.450
<v Speaker 6>of protection,</v>

996
00:58:40.610 --> 00:58:44.260
<v Speaker 2>but we know what a few of those things </v>
<v Speaker 2>are and they have.</v>

997
00:58:44.300 --> 00:58:48.380
<v Speaker 2>They have nothing to do with what's on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the inside of a church or a synagogue or</v>

998
00:58:48.381 --> 00:58:53.381
<v Speaker 2>a mosque.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to do with things like free </v>

999
00:58:53.381 --> 00:58:53.381
<v Speaker 2>speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1000
00:58:53.381 --> 00:58:56.740
<v Speaker 2>Like the trench we are all fighting in </v>
<v Speaker 2>is at least one of them is defense of </v>

1001
00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:05.560
<v Speaker 2>the free exchange of ideas and that has </v>
<v Speaker 2>put in peril by many kinds of </v>

1002
00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:09.851
<v Speaker 2>orthodoxies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But some are the old orthodoxy Is the </v>

1003
00:59:09.851 --> 00:59:12.971
<v Speaker 2>blasphemy laws and the people who want </v>
<v Speaker 2>states to be killed relieving in this </v>

1004
00:59:13.431 --> 00:59:15.070
<v Speaker 2>case islam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

1005
00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:18.380
<v Speaker 2>it's a that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1006
00:59:18.440 --> 00:59:20.750
<v Speaker 2>those are some of the sacred.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

1007
00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:25.730
<v Speaker 2>if were going to list the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sacred artifacts of that that keeps,</v>

1008
00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:30.090
<v Speaker 2>that keeps our society worth living in </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1009
00:59:31.010 --> 00:59:36.010
<v Speaker 2>I think the list is going to be very </v>
<v Speaker 2>long before we start getting to the </v>

1010
00:59:36.010 --> 00:59:38.310
<v Speaker 2>actual sacred objects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyone faith,</v>

1011
00:59:38.550 --> 00:59:40.640
<v Speaker 2>but we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will be things like freedom of speech</v>

1012
00:59:40.641 --> 00:59:44.960
<v Speaker 2>and freedom of assembly and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

1013
00:59:45.020 --> 00:59:50.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the free exchange of ideas across </v>

1014
00:59:50.020 --> 00:59:51.500
<v Speaker 2>boundaries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that we are no longer,</v>

1015
00:59:51.501 --> 00:59:52.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>religiously,</v>

1016
00:59:52.780 --> 00:59:53.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

1017
00:59:53.370 --> 00:59:53.910
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

1018
00:59:54.070 --> 00:59:57.440
<v Speaker 2>or linguistically or geographically </v>
<v Speaker 2>partitioned in the ideas.</v>

1019
00:59:57.441 --> 00:59:58.390
<v Speaker 2>We cAn entertain it.</v>

1020
00:59:58.440 --> 00:59:59.670
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it seems to me though,</v>

1021
01:00:00.070 --> 01:00:04.270
<v Speaker 5>and this may be my own,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my own idiosyncratic reading of the,</v>

1022
01:00:04.670 --> 01:00:06.150
<v Speaker 5>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the domain.</v>

1023
01:00:06.151 --> 01:00:10.890
<v Speaker 5>But when I look at something like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I've often considered the cathedral</v>

1024
01:00:10.891 --> 01:00:11.670
<v Speaker 5>dome,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say,</v>

1025
01:00:11.671 --> 01:00:16.671
<v Speaker 5>and there are very old cathedral domes </v>
<v Speaker 5>that have an image of christ put up </v>

1026
01:00:16.671 --> 01:00:16.920
<v Speaker 5>against the dome,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1027
01:00:16.921 --> 01:00:19.800
<v Speaker 5>So as,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as creator of the cosmos,</v>

1028
01:00:19.801 --> 01:00:20.240
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Canada,</v>

1029
01:00:20.490 --> 01:00:25.490
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to look at that from a </v>
<v Speaker 5>psychological and even a biological </v>

1030
01:00:25.490 --> 01:00:28.491
<v Speaker 5>perspective and what I see is the </v>
<v Speaker 5>elevation of a particular image that </v>

1031
01:00:28.491 --> 01:00:30.840
<v Speaker 5>represents an ideal and so the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1032
01:00:30.930 --> 01:00:33.630
<v Speaker 5>the christ that's represented on the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>on the,</v>

1033
01:00:33.690 --> 01:00:38.690
<v Speaker 5>on the dome of the cathedral is </v>
<v Speaker 5>something that's projected up into </v>

1034
01:00:38.690 --> 01:00:42.140
<v Speaker 5>celestial space.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's an ideal to which you were </v>

1035
01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:43.410
<v Speaker 5>supposed to be subordinate or that </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're supposed to embody.</v>

1036
01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:47.850
<v Speaker 5>And now ideal is the ideal of the logos.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Technically speaking,</v>

1037
01:00:47.851 --> 01:00:49.680
<v Speaker 5>the logos,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the word made flesh,</v>

1038
01:00:49.681 --> 01:00:53.670
<v Speaker 5>which is not only the word free speech </v>
<v Speaker 5>for lack of a better term,</v>

1039
01:00:53.671 --> 01:00:57.360
<v Speaker 5>but also the embodiment of that elevated</v>
<v Speaker 5>to the highest principle.</v>

1040
01:00:57.770 --> 01:01:02.770
<v Speaker 5>and that is given status as the creator </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the universe.</v>

1041
01:01:02.791 --> 01:01:07.791
<v Speaker 5>and the reason for that in part,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this is written into the judeo </v>

1042
01:01:07.791 --> 01:01:10.971
<v Speaker 5>christian doctrine right from line one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is the idea that it's through the </v>

1043
01:01:10.971 --> 01:01:14.580
<v Speaker 5>discourse that you value so much that we</v>
<v Speaker 5>actually engender the world as such,</v>

1044
01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:18.420
<v Speaker 5>and that is a divine principle and it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>also in my reading,</v>

1045
01:01:18.630 --> 01:01:22.410
<v Speaker 5>the divine image of god that men and </v>
<v Speaker 5>women are made in.</v>

1046
01:01:22.530 --> 01:01:27.530
<v Speaker 5>And so what I see in the underlying </v>
<v Speaker 5>metaphysic were where you see </v>

1047
01:01:27.530 --> 01:01:29.310
<v Speaker 5>superstition and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and fundamentalism and look fair enough.</v>

1048
01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:34.560
<v Speaker 5>And it's not like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would never argue that that's not a </v>

1049
01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:35.170
<v Speaker 5>danger.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I see the images stick and,</v>

1050
01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:38.670
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and dramatized representation of exactly</v>

1051
01:01:38.671 --> 01:01:41.670
<v Speaker 5>the idea that you hold to be paramount </v>
<v Speaker 5>above all else.</v>

1052
01:01:41.671 --> 01:01:45.000
<v Speaker 5>Which is your commitment to truth </v>
<v Speaker 5>expressed in speech.</v>

1053
01:01:45.090 --> 01:01:46.530
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's my concern,</v>

1054
01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:51.560
<v Speaker 2>and this is where I started with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that you could give the same </v>

1055
01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:55.971
<v Speaker 2>charitable reading of astrology and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd even be tempted to do it a,</v>

1056
01:01:56.590 --> 01:01:58.860
<v Speaker 2>as we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as we talk about astrology as you showed</v>

1057
01:01:58.861 --> 01:02:01.560
<v Speaker 2>at the outset now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't.</v>

1058
01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:03.970
<v Speaker 5>Why is it a charitable reading,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sam?</v>

1059
01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:08.590
<v Speaker 5>Like how else would you explAin the </v>
<v Speaker 5>existence of something like a cathedral?</v>

1060
01:02:08.990 --> 01:02:11.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the hell are people doing when they</v>

1061
01:02:11.241 --> 01:02:16.241
<v Speaker 2>built them saying we could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's by dent of mirror historical </v>

1062
01:02:16.241 --> 01:02:20.441
<v Speaker 2>contingency and questionable look that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not living in a world where the </v>

1063
01:02:20.941 --> 01:02:25.800
<v Speaker 2>cathedrals have stained glass windows </v>
<v Speaker 2>with signs of the zodiac on them.</v>

1064
01:02:26.130 --> 01:02:27.600
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could be in that world.</v>

1065
01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:28.340
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we are.</v>

1066
01:02:28.370 --> 01:02:33.370
<v Speaker 7>We are.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We were very close to being in that </v>

1067
01:02:33.370 --> 01:02:36.020
<v Speaker 7>world to some degree because the </v>
<v Speaker 7>astrological endeavor in the judaeo </v>

1068
01:02:36.020 --> 01:02:40.431
<v Speaker 7>christian landscape expanded to </v>
<v Speaker 7>incorporate christianity and there's an </v>

1069
01:02:40.431 --> 01:02:42.280
<v Speaker 7>entire astrology of christianity </v>
<v Speaker 7>including representation.</v>

1070
01:02:42.430 --> 01:02:42.670
<v Speaker 7>Christ</v>

1071
01:02:45.190 --> 01:02:45.620
<v Speaker 2>fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1072
01:02:45.621 --> 01:02:46.130
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1073
01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:51.180
<v Speaker 2>but my point is that we recognize that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the literal claims of astrology,</v>

1074
01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:57.400
<v Speaker 2>the mechanism by which astrologers think</v>
<v Speaker 2>it works is intellectually bankrupt.</v>

1075
01:02:59.150 --> 01:03:01.610
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if any significant mayhem were being</v>

1076
01:03:01.611 --> 01:03:03.830
<v Speaker 2>caused by people's commitment to </v>
<v Speaker 2>astrology,</v>

1077
01:03:04.130 --> 01:03:07.950
<v Speaker 2>if we had presidents of the United </v>
<v Speaker 2>States who couldn't get elected unless,</v>

1078
01:03:07.970 --> 01:03:11.180
<v Speaker 2>unless they paid lip service to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>literal believer in astrology,</v>

1079
01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:13.370
<v Speaker 2>if we had presidents who were consulting</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

1080
01:03:13.371 --> 01:03:16.490
<v Speaker 2>astrologers to figure out when to meet </v>
<v Speaker 2>with other world leaders,</v>

1081
01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:17.860
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

1082
01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:22.460
<v Speaker 2>this will be a problem that that </v>
<v Speaker 2>rational people would recognize me.</v>

1083
01:03:22.461 --> 01:03:25.760
<v Speaker 2>Astrology can be disproven in a single </v>
<v Speaker 2>hour.</v>

1084
01:03:25.761 --> 01:03:30.500
<v Speaker 2>You just simply have to go to one </v>
<v Speaker 2>hospital in one city sometime and find,</v>

1085
01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:35.560
<v Speaker 2>find two unrelated children born in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>save within 20 feet of each other and </v>

1086
01:03:35.811 --> 01:03:40.811
<v Speaker 2>follow their lives and if they have </v>
<v Speaker 2>different lives than than than then the </v>

1087
01:03:40.811 --> 01:03:42.050
<v Speaker 2>signs of the zodiac mean nothing.</v>

1088
01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:47.100
<v Speaker 5>Part of your argument is an invalidly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so is hoW in the world do we determine </v>

1089
01:03:47.100 --> 01:03:51.990
<v Speaker 5>which revelatory axioms are worthy of </v>
<v Speaker 5>respect and of maintenance and fair </v>

1090
01:03:52.751 --> 01:03:52.930
<v Speaker 5>enough,</v>

1091
01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:55.140
<v Speaker 7>maybe none,</v>
<v Speaker 7>maybe not,</v>

1092
01:03:55.270 --> 01:04:00.270
<v Speaker 7>but maybe it is just a matter of </v>
<v Speaker 7>conscious agents like ourselves having </v>

1093
01:04:00.270 --> 01:04:01.020
<v Speaker 7>better and better conversation.</v>

1094
01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:03.540
<v Speaker 5>Well that while it is certainly partly </v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

1095
01:04:03.541 --> 01:04:05.280
<v Speaker 5>it is certainly partly that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but let me,</v>

1096
01:04:05.550 --> 01:04:10.550
<v Speaker 2>because again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>revelation in my book is nothing other </v>

1097
01:04:10.550 --> 01:04:14.601
<v Speaker 2>than a record of past conversations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you've either got iron age </v>

1098
01:04:14.601 --> 01:04:17.250
<v Speaker 2>conversations shaping your worldview or </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have conversations like these</v>

1099
01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:20.870
<v Speaker 7>when you're worried you have both.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You can have both.</v>

1100
01:04:21.510 --> 01:04:24.390
<v Speaker 7>You have a dialogue with the past which </v>
<v Speaker 7>brings</v>

1101
01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:28.000
<v Speaker 2>made a marcus aurelius.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read him with great pleasure and great</v>

1102
01:04:28.030 --> 01:04:28.690
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1103
01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:30.430
<v Speaker 2>and astonishment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>frankly,</v>

1104
01:04:30.431 --> 01:04:35.431
<v Speaker 2>I mean it is such a modern and edifying </v>
<v Speaker 2>take on ethics and,</v>

1105
01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:39.050
<v Speaker 2>and one's own personal wellbeing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>just not getting,</v>

1106
01:04:39.090 --> 01:04:42.430
<v Speaker 2>just not being encumbered by the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by thoughts and,</v>

1107
01:04:42.850 --> 01:04:44.360
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and vanities that,</v>

1108
01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:47.380
<v Speaker 2>that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are so easy to cut through once you</v>

1109
01:04:47.381 --> 01:04:50.470
<v Speaker 2>notice them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so captivating and deranging of your</v>

1110
01:04:50.471 --> 01:04:52.060
<v Speaker 2>life when you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he,</v>

1111
01:04:52.090 --> 01:04:54.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean the wisdom in that book than,</v>
<v Speaker 2>than,</v>

1112
01:04:54.311 --> 01:04:59.311
<v Speaker 2>than almost any book I can name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you don't have to believe any </v>

1113
01:04:59.311 --> 01:04:59.311
<v Speaker 2>bullshit to</v>

1114
01:04:59.311 --> 01:05:01.800
<v Speaker 5>let me offer you a continued explication</v>
<v Speaker 5>here.</v>

1115
01:05:01.801 --> 01:05:06.801
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you didn't answer my question about </v>

1116
01:05:06.801 --> 01:05:06.801
<v Speaker 5>what all these crazy medieval people </v>
<v Speaker 5>were doing,</v>

1117
01:05:06.801 --> 01:05:08.730
<v Speaker 5>spending almost all of their excess </v>
<v Speaker 5>capital,</v>

1118
01:05:08.910 --> 01:05:11.760
<v Speaker 5>building a representation of the sky and</v>
<v Speaker 5>putting an image on that.</v>

1119
01:05:11.761 --> 01:05:13.020
<v Speaker 5>So just hang on a sec.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

1120
01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:17.500
<v Speaker 5>so let's talk about what it would mean </v>
<v Speaker 5>to embody the truth.</v>

1121
01:05:17.770 --> 01:05:21.130
<v Speaker 5>So there's a deep idea and christianity </v>
<v Speaker 5>that this is what it would mean.</v>

1122
01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:26.080
<v Speaker 5>It would mean to confront the suffering </v>
<v Speaker 5>of life voluntarily to its fullest,</v>

1123
01:05:26.081 --> 01:05:31.081
<v Speaker 5>which would mean to accept the necessity</v>
<v Speaker 5>of death and betrayal of the hands of </v>

1124
01:05:31.081 --> 01:05:36.061
<v Speaker 5>your fellow men without undue bitterness</v>
<v Speaker 5>to accept that voluntarily and </v>

1125
01:05:36.151 --> 01:05:38.560
<v Speaker 5>antisocial.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Understand that your fundamental ethical</v>

1126
01:05:38.561 --> 01:05:43.561
<v Speaker 5>task is to work towards the redemption </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the world and that's associated with </v>

1127
01:05:43.561 --> 01:05:47.701
<v Speaker 5>that image that's cast upon the heavenly</v>
<v Speaker 5>dome and I and that isn't a charitable </v>

1128
01:05:47.711 --> 01:05:48.580
<v Speaker 5>reading,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sam.</v>

1129
01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:53.860
<v Speaker 5>That's a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's an essential analysis of the </v>

1130
01:05:53.860 --> 01:05:53.860
<v Speaker 5>fundamental doctrines of christianity.</v>

1131
01:05:53.860 --> 01:05:58.030
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I could do the same thing with </v>

1132
01:05:58.030 --> 01:05:58.030
<v Speaker 2>buddhism and give you a slightly </v>
<v Speaker 2>different story,</v>

1133
01:05:58.030 --> 01:06:01.320
<v Speaker 2>but nonetheless inspiring and edifying </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I could do the same thing with you,</v>

1134
01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:04.690
<v Speaker 2>but you can't do it with rationality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can do it.</v>

1135
01:06:04.691 --> 01:06:05.840
<v Speaker 2>I can do it with green.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1136
01:06:05.841 --> 01:06:06.100
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1137
01:06:06.110 --> 01:06:09.350
<v Speaker 2>That's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can do it with greek mythology.</v>

1138
01:06:09.530 --> 01:06:14.530
<v Speaker 2>I can do it with any of these domains,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the crucial bit for me is that in </v>

1139
01:06:14.530 --> 01:06:19.331
<v Speaker 2>order to make use of those stories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to believe in revelation.</v>

1140
01:06:19.730 --> 01:06:22.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't have to believe that you get</v>

1141
01:06:22.581 --> 01:06:26.570
<v Speaker 2>everything you want to after you die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>suggesting that you know no,</v>

1142
01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:31.580
<v Speaker 2>but I'm talking about the applause of </v>
<v Speaker 2>conventionally religious people who </v>

1143
01:06:31.580 --> 01:06:36.431
<v Speaker 2>think that their conventional religion </v>
<v Speaker 2>is in some way cashed out or redeemed or</v>

1144
01:06:37.791 --> 01:06:42.791
<v Speaker 2>supported by the reading your given now </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the of christ in the starry heavens.</v>

1145
01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:47.120
<v Speaker 2>It's not unless you're adding this other</v>
<v Speaker 2>piece,</v>

1146
01:06:47.121 --> 01:06:51.170
<v Speaker 2>which is some probabilistic claim that </v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

1147
01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:56.200
<v Speaker 2>this book probably was dictated by an </v>
<v Speaker 2>omniscient being unlike any other book </v>

1148
01:06:56.200 --> 01:07:00.910
<v Speaker 2>or maybe the muslims are right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Archangel gabriel did show up to </v>

1149
01:07:00.910 --> 01:07:03.941
<v Speaker 2>muhammad and his cave and give him the </v>
<v Speaker 2>one final revelation never to be </v>

1150
01:07:03.941 --> 01:07:07.220
<v Speaker 2>superseded and just on the merits of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>text.</v>

1151
01:07:07.221 --> 01:07:11.450
<v Speaker 2>We know that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know for all it gets wrong and all it</v>

1152
01:07:11.451 --> 01:07:14.000
<v Speaker 2>fails to get right about the nature of </v>
<v Speaker 2>our circumstance.</v>

1153
01:07:14.270 --> 01:07:18.110
<v Speaker 2>We know that book is not the best book </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever written on any topic,</v>

1154
01:07:18.111 --> 01:07:19.870
<v Speaker 2>and here I'm speaking of the koran,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's true.</v>

1155
01:07:19.890 --> 01:07:24.890
<v Speaker 2>The bible is true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's true of the meditations of marcus </v>

1156
01:07:24.890 --> 01:07:24.890
<v Speaker 2>aurelius,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the book,</v>

1157
01:07:24.890 --> 01:07:29.700
<v Speaker 2>but no one's claiming that about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>meditations and that's a crucial </v>

1158
01:07:29.700 --> 01:07:32.900
<v Speaker 2>difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a difference that that explained so</v>

1159
01:07:32.901 --> 01:07:36.800
<v Speaker 2>much unnecessary suffering in our world </v>
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

1160
01:07:36.801 --> 01:07:41.801
<v Speaker 2>what I fear about the way you talk about</v>
<v Speaker 2>religion is that it'd be a at the end of</v>

1161
01:07:44.750 --> 01:07:49.750
<v Speaker 2>all of these conversations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm still not sure what you believe on </v>

1162
01:07:49.750 --> 01:07:49.750
<v Speaker 2>that point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>frankly,</v>

1163
01:07:49.750 --> 01:07:53.800
<v Speaker 7>and if I'm not sure no one out there as </v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1164
01:07:53.841 --> 01:07:55.540
<v Speaker 7>why don't know why.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know why.</v>

1165
01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:59.050
<v Speaker 5>Expect to be sure about what someone </v>
<v Speaker 5>believes.</v>

1166
01:07:59.051 --> 01:08:04.051
<v Speaker 5>How do you think that any one of you are</v>
<v Speaker 5>capable of fully articulating what you </v>

1167
01:08:04.051 --> 01:08:04.051
<v Speaker 5>believe you sir,</v>

1168
01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:09.500
<v Speaker 7>you aren't completely ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're not transparent to yourself by </v>

1169
01:08:09.911 --> 01:08:13.360
<v Speaker 7>any stretch of the imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 7>you act out all sorts of things that you</v>

1170
01:08:13.361 --> 01:08:15.300
<v Speaker 7>can't articulate what but how you.</v>

1171
01:08:15.410 --> 01:08:17.670
<v Speaker 3>How about at best gets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1172
01:08:19.060 --> 01:08:20.050
<v Speaker 7>no.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you look,</v>

1173
01:08:20.230 --> 01:08:22.780
<v Speaker 7>let's go on cognitive neuroscience on </v>
<v Speaker 7>this,</v>

1174
01:08:22.781 --> 01:08:27.781
<v Speaker 7>shall we?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Ninety nine percent of your processing </v>

1175
01:08:27.781 --> 01:08:30.451
<v Speaker 7>is unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're not capable of articulating </v>

1176
01:08:30.451 --> 01:08:30.451
<v Speaker 7>yourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you were,</v>

1177
01:08:30.451 --> 01:08:32.830
<v Speaker 7>you'd be omniscient.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Give me any nonsense about that,</v>

1178
01:08:32.930 --> 01:08:34.690
<v Speaker 3>but that is a.</v>

1179
01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:43.540
<v Speaker 2>I've never heard so many people applaud </v>
<v Speaker 2>and of a of a simple question.</v>

1180
01:08:44.990 --> 01:08:45.740
<v Speaker 3>It was a good one,</v>

1181
01:08:48.950 --> 01:08:50.450
<v Speaker 2>honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1182
01:08:50.510 --> 01:08:55.510
<v Speaker 2>Everything you just said about not being</v>
<v Speaker 2>fully transparent to yourself is true </v>

1183
01:08:55.510 --> 01:08:57.860
<v Speaker 2>and you are ruled by committee in there </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the time.</v>

1184
01:08:57.861 --> 01:08:59.740
<v Speaker 2>No doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm at.</v>

1185
01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:02.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm asking what you actually believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1186
01:09:02.901 --> 01:09:05.450
<v Speaker 2>there's several things I can ask a </v>
<v Speaker 2>asset.</v>

1187
01:09:05.460 --> 01:09:08.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean almost any one of these threads </v>
<v Speaker 2>can,</v>

1188
01:09:08.250 --> 01:09:12.620
<v Speaker 2>can pull the whole tapestry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to take christianity as an example,</v>

1189
01:09:13.340 --> 01:09:18.340
<v Speaker 2>what do you believe about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the origin of this sacred book,</v>

1190
01:09:18.860 --> 01:09:20.690
<v Speaker 2>the bible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>old and new testament.</v>

1191
01:09:20.691 --> 01:09:25.691
<v Speaker 2>Do you believe that just maybe it has a </v>
<v Speaker 2>status unlike any other book or is it </v>

1192
01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:32.420
<v Speaker 2>simply old Writing of human beings just </v>
<v Speaker 2>like ourselves?</v>

1193
01:09:32.610 --> 01:09:33.690
<v Speaker 6>I think it's both.</v>

1194
01:09:34.190 --> 01:09:34.880
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1195
01:09:34.881 --> 01:09:35.420
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1196
01:09:35.450 --> 01:09:36.530
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what does that mean?</v>

1197
01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:41.560
<v Speaker 2>That you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're saying you're saying that </v>

1198
01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:42.860
<v Speaker 2>there's somebody who's taking dictation </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is unlike any other dictation.</v>

1199
01:09:42.861 --> 01:09:44.330
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so homer</v>

1200
01:09:44.460 --> 01:09:46.280
<v Speaker 7>though creative or shakespeare they'll </v>
<v Speaker 7>create.</v>

1201
01:09:46.290 --> 01:09:49.110
<v Speaker 7>It was sources of inspiration.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

1202
01:09:49.140 --> 01:09:53.820
<v Speaker 7>But everyone's been inspired.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you talk to creative people basically</v>

1203
01:09:53.930 --> 01:09:58.930
<v Speaker 6>often described themselves as something </v>
<v Speaker 6>approximating a conduit through which </v>

1204
01:09:58.930 --> 01:09:59.290
<v Speaker 6>higher wisdom is pouring.</v>

1205
01:09:59.430 --> 01:10:04.430
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're dodging shakes that shakespeare </v>

1206
01:10:04.430 --> 01:10:05.770
<v Speaker 2>could say that and any writer can say </v>
<v Speaker 2>that really ultimately,</v>

1207
01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:09.110
<v Speaker 6>and it's also the case that we would or </v>
<v Speaker 6>we would rank organize.</v>

1208
01:10:09.140 --> 01:10:14.140
<v Speaker 6>We would rank order those writers,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is why you pointed to shakespeare </v>

1209
01:10:14.140 --> 01:10:16.970
<v Speaker 6>in terms of the generalizable validity </v>
<v Speaker 6>of the revelations.</v>

1210
01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:18.290
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So well look,</v>

1211
01:10:18.291 --> 01:10:19.820
<v Speaker 6>so,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so you run into the same issue.</v>

1212
01:10:19.821 --> 01:10:22.190
<v Speaker 6>You know you criticize the bible and </v>
<v Speaker 6>look fair enough.</v>

1213
01:10:22.220 --> 01:10:24.080
<v Speaker 6>You know the man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you're,</v>

1214
01:10:24.090 --> 01:10:27.020
<v Speaker 6>you're also evading a very important </v>
<v Speaker 6>issue which is how do you,</v>

1215
01:10:27.230 --> 01:10:32.230
<v Speaker 6>how do you quantitatively rank the </v>
<v Speaker 6>contributions of literature without </v>

1216
01:10:32.230 --> 01:10:33.170
<v Speaker 6>assuming that there's a hierarchy of </v>
<v Speaker 6>revelation?</v>

1217
01:10:33.710 --> 01:10:35.590
<v Speaker 2>Well though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a hierarchy of wisdom.</v>

1218
01:10:35.591 --> 01:10:38.200
<v Speaker 2>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a hierarchy of human wisdom.</v>

1219
01:10:38.201 --> 01:10:40.000
<v Speaker 2>I will grant you that everyday of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>week,</v>

1220
01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:45.440
<v Speaker 2>but this is what we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>primates like ourselves having </v>

1221
01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:48.460
<v Speaker 2>conversations and this is the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>important game.</v>

1222
01:10:48.461 --> 01:10:51.640
<v Speaker 2>We can play this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the best game in town and it has</v>

1223
01:10:51.641 --> 01:10:55.440
<v Speaker 2>always been so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But people are imagining and,</v>

1224
01:10:55.450 --> 01:10:57.730
<v Speaker 2>and it includes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you said at the outset,</v>

1225
01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:01.570
<v Speaker 2>what I would call spiritual experience </v>
<v Speaker 2>and spiritual experience,</v>

1226
01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:06.600
<v Speaker 2>is it mit's have a fact based discussion</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the nature of human consciousness </v>

1227
01:11:06.790 --> 01:11:07.150
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

1228
01:11:07.450 --> 01:11:10.510
<v Speaker 7>why do you allow that as an exception?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like it because</v>

1229
01:11:11.180 --> 01:11:13.600
<v Speaker 2>is part of the dataset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's</v>

1230
01:11:13.660 --> 01:11:18.660
<v Speaker 7>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So this is spiritual experience without </v>

1231
01:11:18.660 --> 01:11:20.260
<v Speaker 7>the possible of possibility of </v>
<v Speaker 7>concretized revelation.</v>

1232
01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:23.500
<v Speaker 7>So it's a formless spirituality that </v>
<v Speaker 7>you're advocating.</v>

1233
01:11:23.540 --> 01:11:23.870
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1234
01:11:23.871 --> 01:11:24.400
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1235
01:11:24.401 --> 01:11:25.580
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can have.</v>

1236
01:11:25.850 --> 01:11:29.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even discounting the possibility</v>

1237
01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:34.600
<v Speaker 2>that there are invisible entities out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there in the universe far smarter than </v>

1238
01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:37.220
<v Speaker 2>ourselves who we could possibly be in </v>
<v Speaker 2>dialogue with.</v>

1239
01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:42.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean there are many strange ideas that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could defend to one or another degree</v>

1240
01:11:42.810 --> 01:11:46.250
<v Speaker 2>that there are people walking around </v>
<v Speaker 2>speculating that we might be living in a</v>

1241
01:11:46.251 --> 01:11:51.251
<v Speaker 2>computer simulation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that all of this is being run on some </v>

1242
01:11:51.251 --> 01:11:51.860
<v Speaker 2>hard drive of the future or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or some,</v>

1243
01:11:51.861 --> 01:11:56.861
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alien supercomputer now that you can </v>

1244
01:11:56.861 --> 01:11:56.861
<v Speaker 2>actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1245
01:11:56.861 --> 01:12:00.641
<v Speaker 2>nick bostrom and oxford gives a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>cogent argument in defense of that </v>

1246
01:12:00.641 --> 01:12:01.700
<v Speaker 2>thesis right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>

1247
01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:06.760
<v Speaker 2>you can deal with that on its merits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying the university isn't </v>

1248
01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:06.830
<v Speaker 2>stranger than we suppose or even kenzo </v>
<v Speaker 2>pose,</v>

1249
01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:11.480
<v Speaker 2>but one thing we know is that when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>read the bible,</v>

1250
01:12:11.481 --> 01:12:16.481
<v Speaker 2>you can turn every page of that book and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will not find evidence of </v>

1251
01:12:16.761 --> 01:12:17.830
<v Speaker 2>omniscience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>

1252
01:12:17.831 --> 01:12:22.831
<v Speaker 2>You will not find anything in there that</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone as smart as shakespeare or </v>

1253
01:12:23.271 --> 01:12:26.270
<v Speaker 2>actually a little bit dumber could have </v>
<v Speaker 2>written.</v>

1254
01:12:26.710 --> 01:12:27.940
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't think that's true.</v>

1255
01:12:27.941 --> 01:12:29.030
<v Speaker 7>Sam.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There are incredibly.</v>

1256
01:12:29.700 --> 01:12:34.700
<v Speaker 7>There's whatever else they might say </v>
<v Speaker 7>about the biblical writings are </v>

1257
01:12:34.700 --> 01:12:37.861
<v Speaker 7>incredibly potent nearby,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but so it's impossible to write </v>

1258
01:12:37.861 --> 01:12:42.061
<v Speaker 7>something.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's virtually impossible to write </v>

1259
01:12:42.061 --> 01:12:42.061
<v Speaker 7>something like cain and abel was a </v>
<v Speaker 7>paragraph saying shit.</v>

1260
01:12:42.061 --> 01:12:42.061
<v Speaker 7>You understand?</v>
<v Speaker 7>That</v>

1261
01:12:42.350 --> 01:12:47.350
<v Speaker 2>spirit of the shakespeare of of two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>3000 years ago couldn't have written </v>

1262
01:12:47.350 --> 01:12:47.350
<v Speaker 2>genesis.</v>

1263
01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:50.080
<v Speaker 7>He couldn't have written to cain and </v>
<v Speaker 7>abel not in 10 sentences,</v>

1264
01:12:50.470 --> 01:12:54.700
<v Speaker 7>so then enable is 10 sentences long.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So then it contains more wisdom than you</v>

1265
01:12:54.701 --> 01:12:55.930
<v Speaker 7>can.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Then you can dig out.</v>

1266
01:12:55.960 --> 01:12:56.210
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>

1267
01:12:57.130 --> 01:13:02.130
<v Speaker 2>but now we're getting to the nub of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you think that it was not the </v>

1268
01:13:02.130 --> 01:13:02.130
<v Speaker 2>product of a human mind.</v>

1269
01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:07.880
<v Speaker 7>I think it was the product of a vast </v>
<v Speaker 7>collection of human minds working over </v>

1270
01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:07.880
<v Speaker 7>millennia.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>

1271
01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:12.550
<v Speaker 7>so one of shakespeare's so,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but still we still,</v>

1272
01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:13.500
<v Speaker 7>we've just got people,</v>

1273
01:13:14.310 --> 01:13:16.350
<v Speaker 2>and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this concession,</v>

1274
01:13:16.380 --> 01:13:18.690
<v Speaker 2>if indeed you're making it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm still not sure,</v>

1275
01:13:18.930 --> 01:13:21.600
<v Speaker 2>is the eradication of traditional </v>
<v Speaker 2>christianity.</v>

1276
01:13:21.690 --> 01:13:26.520
<v Speaker 7>If something is deeply wise,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's reflective of a deeper reality.</v>

1277
01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:30.240
<v Speaker 7>otherwise it wouldn't be wise.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm in love with deeper reality,</v>

1278
01:13:30.420 --> 01:13:35.420
<v Speaker 7>deeper reality that something is wise is</v>
<v Speaker 7>the story of cain and abel reflect </v>

1279
01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:36.090
<v Speaker 7>reality.</v>

1280
01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:41.720
<v Speaker 2>The landscape of mind that we are that </v>
<v Speaker 2>either takes great training,</v>

1281
01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:48.720
<v Speaker 2>great luck or pharmacological </v>
<v Speaker 2>bombardment of the human brain to </v>

1282
01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:50.170
<v Speaker 2>explore right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is a way,</v>

1283
01:13:50.171 --> 01:13:55.171
<v Speaker 2>there are ways to get there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are ways to have the vision right </v>

1284
01:13:55.171 --> 01:13:59.100
<v Speaker 2>and and if we will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we understand this to some degree,</v>

1285
01:14:00.251 --> 01:14:04.270
<v Speaker 2>but experientially and we can understand</v>
<v Speaker 2>it to some degree by,</v>

1286
01:14:04.630 --> 01:14:09.630
<v Speaker 2>by third per person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>methods of science and it's not.</v>

1287
01:14:09.820 --> 01:14:14.820
<v Speaker 2>It's not like I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've had many experiences that if</v>

1288
01:14:15.341 --> 01:14:20.341
<v Speaker 2>I had them in a religious context would </v>
<v Speaker 2>have counted for me as evidence of the </v>

1289
01:14:20.341 --> 01:14:21.430
<v Speaker 2>truth of my religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1290
01:14:21.431 --> 01:14:26.431
<v Speaker 2>But because I was not brought up in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious context and because I spend a </v>

1291
01:14:26.951 --> 01:14:31.840
<v Speaker 2>lot of time seeing the downside of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>form of credulity,</v>

1292
01:14:32.530 --> 01:14:35.510
<v Speaker 2>I have never been tempted to interpret </v>
<v Speaker 2>these experiences that</v>

1293
01:14:35.950 --> 01:14:38.730
<v Speaker 8>try a higher dose.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I prepped,</v>

1294
01:14:38.740 --> 01:14:40.700
<v Speaker 8>believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'll,</v>

1295
01:14:40.710 --> 01:14:41.500
<v Speaker 8>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'll go.</v>

1296
01:14:42.250 --> 01:14:44.560
<v Speaker 8>I'll play that game of poker with you </v>
<v Speaker 8>all day long.</v>

1297
01:14:45.650 --> 01:14:49.030
<v Speaker 8>Be surprised as well.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Maybe.</v>

1298
01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:52.480
<v Speaker 8>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Maybe there's our next podcast.</v>

1299
01:14:55.180 --> 01:14:56.890
<v Speaker 8>Did you see a car that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Okay,</v>

1300
01:14:58.390 --> 01:15:03.390
<v Speaker 4>a question now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we're an hour and 15 minutes into </v>

1301
01:15:03.661 --> 01:15:08.590
<v Speaker 4>this discussion and hypothetically what </v>
<v Speaker 4>we will do is stop and,</v>

1302
01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:14.120
<v Speaker 4>and go to q and a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But our experience So far has been when </v>

1303
01:15:14.371 --> 01:15:17.130
<v Speaker 4>we asked the audience,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because we have done that each time,</v>

1304
01:15:17.700 --> 01:15:22.700
<v Speaker 4>whether we asked the audience whether we</v>
<v Speaker 4>should continue or whether we should go </v>

1305
01:15:22.700 --> 01:15:24.570
<v Speaker 4>to q and a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the first thing I'm going to do,</v>

1306
01:15:24.571 --> 01:15:29.571
<v Speaker 4>and you can vote on this by making a </v>
<v Speaker 4>certain amount of noise if you're </v>

1307
01:15:29.571 --> 01:15:33.471
<v Speaker 4>inclined to do so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how many of you would like us to stop </v>

1308
01:15:33.471 --> 01:15:34.020
<v Speaker 4>talking and go to q and a?</v>

1309
01:15:37.870 --> 01:15:42.870
<v Speaker 8>How many of you would like us to </v>
<v Speaker 8>continue this discussion for 45 more </v>

1310
01:15:42.870 --> 01:15:42.870
<v Speaker 8>minutes?</v>

1311
01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:49.780
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1312
01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:57.500
<v Speaker 8>it seems to me that it's an objective </v>
<v Speaker 8>fact is the ladder people have the </v>

1313
01:15:57.500 --> 01:15:57.500
<v Speaker 8>floor.</v>

1314
01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:03.240
<v Speaker 2>It really is going to be a rude </v>
<v Speaker 2>awakening when those applause or </v>

1315
01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:03.240
<v Speaker 2>reversed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>however.</v>

1316
01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:03.380
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we know.</v>

1317
01:16:06.490 --> 01:16:09.170
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So let,</v>

1318
01:16:09.230 --> 01:16:11.920
<v Speaker 8>let,</v>
<v Speaker 8>let me yet what douglas say something.</v>

1319
01:16:12.670 --> 01:16:16.340
<v Speaker 8>What was that last summer?</v>
<v Speaker 8>I was going to ask something.</v>

1320
01:16:16.380 --> 01:16:16.940
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

1321
01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:22.640
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I forgot what I was going to ask you </v>

1322
01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:22.640
<v Speaker 8>something.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Let's go back.</v>

1323
01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:22.810
<v Speaker 8>Let's go back</v>

1324
01:16:22.890 --> 01:16:25.350
<v Speaker 4>to v two.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the core problems that we've been</v>

1325
01:16:25.351 --> 01:16:27.660
<v Speaker 4>trying to address,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is the,</v>

1326
01:16:28.350 --> 01:16:33.350
<v Speaker 4>the apparent failure perhaps of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>rationalist atheist types to develop a,</v>

1327
01:16:39.290 --> 01:16:44.290
<v Speaker 4>an active ethos that has sufficient </v>
<v Speaker 4>beauty and motivational power to serve </v>

1328
01:16:46.741 --> 01:16:49.890
<v Speaker 4>as a credible replacement for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>religious rituals.</v>

1329
01:16:50.700 --> 01:16:55.700
<v Speaker 4>So there seems to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there must be a reason why that's that </v>

1330
01:16:55.700 --> 01:16:56.490
<v Speaker 4>failure has occurred.</v>

1331
01:16:56.980 --> 01:16:58.020
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>

1332
01:16:58.070 --> 01:17:00.380
<v Speaker 8>So,</v>
<v Speaker 8>or</v>

1333
01:17:00.380 --> 01:17:04.790
<v Speaker 2>list of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is that traditionally the impulse to</v>

1334
01:17:04.791 --> 01:17:08.120
<v Speaker 2>do that in a religious context has been </v>
<v Speaker 2>fatal.</v>

1335
01:17:08.980 --> 01:17:13.980
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to declare your apostasy has been </v>

1336
01:17:13.980 --> 01:17:17.770
<v Speaker 2>almost as reliable way of committing </v>
<v Speaker 2>suicide as jumping off a building in </v>

1337
01:17:17.770 --> 01:17:22.541
<v Speaker 2>most cultures and most societies for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>longest time and still is in many places</v>

1338
01:17:22.881 --> 01:17:23.990
<v Speaker 2>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the muslim world.</v>

1339
01:17:24.470 --> 01:17:29.470
<v Speaker 2>So there has been a barrier to entry to </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking creatively about alternatives </v>

1340
01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:35.260
<v Speaker 2>to religion and so much of atheism and </v>
<v Speaker 2>secularism is just a,</v>

1341
01:17:35.290 --> 01:17:36.440
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

1342
01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:40.370
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a pitched battle against the,</v>

1343
01:17:40.730 --> 01:17:45.730
<v Speaker 2>the eroding power of religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when religion really has its power,</v>

1344
01:17:46.730 --> 01:17:48.260
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know what it's like.</v>

1345
01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:50.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1346
01:17:50.390 --> 01:17:51.890
<v Speaker 2>I think what we spoke about this at one </v>
<v Speaker 2>point,</v>

1347
01:17:51.891 --> 01:17:56.891
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just that the moment that it makes this </v>

1348
01:17:56.891 --> 01:17:56.891
<v Speaker 2>most salient is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1349
01:17:56.891 --> 01:18:00.650
<v Speaker 2>galileo being shown the instruments of </v>
<v Speaker 2>torture by men who wouldn't look through</v>

1350
01:18:00.651 --> 01:18:01.550
<v Speaker 2>his telescope.</v>

1351
01:18:01.580 --> 01:18:01.910
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1352
01:18:01.911 --> 01:18:06.911
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the point of contact between </v>

1353
01:18:06.911 --> 01:18:09.620
<v Speaker 2>untrammeled human rationality and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the womb that bore it,</v>

1354
01:18:09.830 --> 01:18:13.550
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your real religious are at,</v>

1355
01:18:13.620 --> 01:18:15.170
<v Speaker 2>at the beauty of the heavens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1356
01:18:15.410 --> 01:18:20.410
<v Speaker 2>So the moment a person like galileo </v>
<v Speaker 2>stepped a little too far and to connect </v>

1357
01:18:20.410 --> 01:18:22.310
<v Speaker 2>us to astrology again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>galileo was a court astrologer,</v>

1358
01:18:22.340 --> 01:18:23.470
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they were,</v>

1359
01:18:23.540 --> 01:18:28.540
<v Speaker 2>there was a car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a point of contact between </v>

1360
01:18:28.540 --> 01:18:30.311
<v Speaker 2>astronomy and astrology at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're still under the shadow of that </v>

1361
01:18:31.611 --> 01:18:35.180
<v Speaker 2>kind of dogmatism and oppression in much</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the world.</v>

1362
01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:37.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the longest time,</v>

1363
01:18:37.540 --> 01:18:42.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's still in the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You cannot run for the presidency </v>

1364
01:18:42.540 --> 01:18:44.900
<v Speaker 2>without pretending to believe in god.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

1365
01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:46.670
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1366
01:18:46.790 --> 01:18:49.520
<v Speaker 2>When will that change it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some day it will,</v>

1367
01:18:49.820 --> 01:18:54.820
<v Speaker 2>but we have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have just had almost no time to </v>

1368
01:18:54.820 --> 01:18:55.340
<v Speaker 2>experiment in this space and innovation</v>

1369
01:18:55.450 --> 01:19:00.450
<v Speaker 1>sometimes have been some decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose the thing that unites unites </v>

1370
01:19:00.510 --> 01:19:05.510
<v Speaker 1>Jordan and me on this is if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we face some of the problems,</v>

1371
01:19:06.661 --> 01:19:09.840
<v Speaker 1>some of the enemies you might even say </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you identify as well,</v>

1372
01:19:10.690 --> 01:19:15.690
<v Speaker 1>and the question is whether you should </v>
<v Speaker 1>face them in the midst of an experiment </v>

1373
01:19:15.690 --> 01:19:20.391
<v Speaker 1>that may or may not work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I leap into pure rationality or whether </v>

1374
01:19:20.551 --> 01:19:23.010
<v Speaker 1>you might decide it's worth among other </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1375
01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:28.040
<v Speaker 1>Taking some of the versions of things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you've had that have been worth in </v>

1376
01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:30.000
<v Speaker 1>your past and using them where they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>useful.</v>

1377
01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:32.360
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what are you picturing there because</v>

1378
01:19:32.460 --> 01:19:37.460
<v Speaker 2>there really is no leap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no global leap too pure </v>

1379
01:19:37.460 --> 01:19:37.460
<v Speaker 2>rationality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's just.</v>

1380
01:19:37.580 --> 01:19:42.580
<v Speaker 2>There's this incremental or erosion of </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious answers to terrestrial </v>

1381
01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:47.480
<v Speaker 2>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's again,</v>

1382
01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:51.860
<v Speaker 2>the moment you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a science of neurology,</v>

1383
01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:56.570
<v Speaker 2>you begin to look at epilepsy not as </v>
<v Speaker 2>demonic possession,</v>

1384
01:19:56.571 --> 01:20:00.110
<v Speaker 2>but as a neurological problem before </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a science of neurology.</v>

1385
01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:01.580
<v Speaker 2>You don't know what the hell's </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>

1386
01:20:01.850 --> 01:20:02.270
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1387
01:20:02.330 --> 01:20:03.580
<v Speaker 2>so into that safe.</v>

1388
01:20:03.620 --> 01:20:08.400
<v Speaker 1>Something obviously drove douglas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say in some sense,</v>

1389
01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:13.720
<v Speaker 6>I'm surprisingly to make the assumption </v>
<v Speaker 6>that one of the things that we need to </v>

1390
01:20:14.821 --> 01:20:19.260
<v Speaker 6>do to defend whatever it is that we have</v>
<v Speaker 6>a value in the west,</v>

1391
01:20:19.261 --> 01:20:24.261
<v Speaker 6>assuming that we have anything of value,</v>
<v Speaker 6>was something like the reincorporation </v>

1392
01:20:25.171 --> 01:20:27.420
<v Speaker 6>of this religious substructure </v>
<v Speaker 6>structure.</v>

1393
01:20:27.421 --> 01:20:31.500
<v Speaker 6>So it's not something that I would have </v>
<v Speaker 6>expected you to conclude,</v>

1394
01:20:31.530 --> 01:20:33.690
<v Speaker 6>but what did you conclude it?</v>

1395
01:20:34.250 --> 01:20:39.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly for the reason I just suggested </v>

1396
01:20:39.250 --> 01:20:43.650
<v Speaker 1>the leap into pure rationality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no evidence yet that it's going </v>

1397
01:20:43.650 --> 01:20:47.411
<v Speaker 1>to work or there's going to be enough or</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough people are going to be able to </v>

1398
01:20:47.411 --> 01:20:47.411
<v Speaker 1>partake in it.</v>

1399
01:20:47.411 --> 01:20:51.120
<v Speaker 2>Give me the place where you're worried </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's going to fail and what can </v>

1400
01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:52.430
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you imagining now?</v>

1401
01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:53.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me give you one example,</v>

1402
01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:58.980
<v Speaker 1>and we may be in the midst of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovery that the only thing worse than</v>

1403
01:20:58.981 --> 01:21:00.570
<v Speaker 1>religion is its absence</v>

1404
01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:03.900
<v Speaker 2>and where.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where are we discovering that?</v>

1405
01:21:04.330 --> 01:21:07.060
<v Speaker 1>Look at the religions that people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>making up as we speak.</v>

1406
01:21:07.630 --> 01:21:12.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean everyday there's a new dogma and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and I and Jordan have repeatedly </v>

1407
01:21:12.630 --> 01:21:16.240
<v Speaker 1>trips over those documents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some usually survived.</v>

1408
01:21:16.241 --> 01:21:21.241
<v Speaker 1>It has to be said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there the stampeding create new </v>

1409
01:21:21.341 --> 01:21:22.600
<v Speaker 1>religion all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the moment,</v>

1410
01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:27.960
<v Speaker 1>every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every new heresy that's invented and </v>

1411
01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:28.840
<v Speaker 1>they're not as well thought through as </v>
<v Speaker 1>past heresies.</v>

1412
01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:31.990
<v Speaker 1>They don't always have the bloody </v>
<v Speaker 1>repercussions yet,</v>

1413
01:21:32.380 --> 01:21:37.380
<v Speaker 1>but you can easily foresee a situation </v>
<v Speaker 1>in which they do represent a new </v>

1414
01:21:37.380 --> 01:21:41.131
<v Speaker 1>religion is being created as we speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by a new generation of people who think </v>

1415
01:21:41.131 --> 01:21:42.760
<v Speaker 1>they are non ideological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who think they are very rational,</v>

1416
01:21:42.761 --> 01:21:45.640
<v Speaker 1>who think they're past the myth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think that past story,</v>

1417
01:21:45.820 --> 01:21:50.820
<v Speaker 1>who think they're better than any of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their ancestors and have never bothered </v>

1418
01:21:50.820 --> 01:21:50.820
<v Speaker 1>to even study their ancestors,</v>

1419
01:21:50.820 --> 01:21:50.820
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1420
01:21:57.060 --> 01:22:00.540
<v Speaker 2>Can't you say that dogmatism is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem,</v>

1421
01:22:00.541 --> 01:22:02.970
<v Speaker 2>but the generic problem here is </v>
<v Speaker 2>dogmatism.</v>

1422
01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:07.650
<v Speaker 2>A firm believer in the absence of good </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument and good evidence,</v>

1423
01:22:09.450 --> 01:22:14.450
<v Speaker 1>absolutely we can agree that dogmatism </v>
<v Speaker 1>of any kind has that danger or we'll </v>

1424
01:22:14.450 --> 01:22:17.850
<v Speaker 1>always have that danger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the void also has a danger.</v>

1425
01:22:18.270 --> 01:22:23.270
<v Speaker 1>The void that you can create if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>throw out all the stories that helped </v>

1426
01:22:23.270 --> 01:22:26.550
<v Speaker 1>get you to where you are also has this </v>
<v Speaker 1>danger because people come up with these</v>

1427
01:22:26.551 --> 01:22:30.510
<v Speaker 1>new stories and every day's news now is </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this.</v>

1428
01:22:30.511 --> 01:22:33.990
<v Speaker 1>Every our politics is now basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this.</v>

1429
01:22:34.860 --> 01:22:35.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1430
01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:40.750
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and what and what's flowing in to fill </v>

1431
01:22:40.750 --> 01:22:40.750
<v Speaker 6>the gap seems to be something like a new</v>
<v Speaker 6>tribalism,</v>

1432
01:22:40.940 --> 01:22:43.280
<v Speaker 6>which is exactly what you'd expect in </v>
<v Speaker 6>some sense,</v>

1433
01:22:43.281 --> 01:22:43.820
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you,</v>

1434
01:22:44.050 --> 01:22:46.490
<v Speaker 6>if you demolish the superordinate </v>
<v Speaker 6>system,</v>

1435
01:22:46.700 --> 01:22:48.950
<v Speaker 6>you know religion divides people no </v>
<v Speaker 6>doubt,</v>

1436
01:22:48.951 --> 01:22:53.951
<v Speaker 6>but it also unites people and so one of </v>
<v Speaker 6>the things that arguably unites people </v>

1437
01:22:54.561 --> 01:22:59.561
<v Speaker 6>above their mirror tribalism is there a </v>
<v Speaker 6>union and an abstract religious </v>

1438
01:22:59.561 --> 01:23:01.550
<v Speaker 6>superstructure,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then if you demolish that,</v>

1439
01:23:01.820 --> 01:23:06.820
<v Speaker 6>well then one of the things that does </v>
<v Speaker 6>seem to happen is the of a reflexive </v>

1440
01:23:06.820 --> 01:23:11.430
<v Speaker 6>tribalism because people need,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they need a group identity of sorts and </v>

1441
01:23:11.430 --> 01:23:16.081
<v Speaker 6>the easiest thing to do seems to be to </v>
<v Speaker 6>revert to ethnicity and race and gender </v>

1442
01:23:16.081 --> 01:23:16.590
<v Speaker 6>and sex,</v>
<v Speaker 6>et cetera,</v>

1443
01:23:16.591 --> 01:23:21.591
<v Speaker 6>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then we do end up and have ended up </v>

1444
01:23:21.591 --> 01:23:22.980
<v Speaker 6>in this situation that douglas outlines.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you know,</v>

1445
01:23:23.070 --> 01:23:26.230
<v Speaker 6>one of the things I think that </v>
<v Speaker 6>distinguishes us temperamentally,</v>

1446
01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:31.440
<v Speaker 6>possibly maybe because you're a little </v>
<v Speaker 6>more on the liberal side and I'm a </v>

1447
01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:31.440
<v Speaker 6>little more on the conservative side.</v>

1448
01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:36.240
<v Speaker 6>Even temperamentally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is that your fundamental terror is that </v>

1449
01:23:36.551 --> 01:23:41.551
<v Speaker 6>a fundamentalism.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Although you also state in the moral </v>

1450
01:23:41.551 --> 01:23:43.030
<v Speaker 6>landscape that you understand the perils</v>
<v Speaker 6>of nihilism.</v>

1451
01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:46.660
<v Speaker 6>And I would say my fundamental terror is</v>
<v Speaker 6>that of nihilism.</v>

1452
01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:50.470
<v Speaker 6>Even though I'm susceptible sensitive to</v>
<v Speaker 6>the catastrophes of fundamentalism.</v>

1453
01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:55.660
<v Speaker 6>But I don't think you do address the </v>
<v Speaker 6>problem of the void sufficiently because</v>

1454
01:23:55.661 --> 01:24:00.661
<v Speaker 6>I don't think that you have anything to </v>
<v Speaker 6>offer except an and I'm not trying to </v>

1455
01:24:00.661 --> 01:24:05.581
<v Speaker 6>minimize your offering.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You make a case that people should work </v>

1456
01:24:05.581 --> 01:24:06.550
<v Speaker 6>to alleviate suffering and that we </v>
<v Speaker 6>should live in truth.</v>

1457
01:24:06.551 --> 01:24:07.450
<v Speaker 6>But jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sam,</v>

1458
01:24:07.451 --> 01:24:12.250
<v Speaker 6>you can summarize that in two sentences.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't have the potency of,</v>

1459
01:24:12.270 --> 01:24:15.160
<v Speaker 6>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>of the fictional literary,</v>

1460
01:24:15.161 --> 01:24:20.161
<v Speaker 6>artistic substructure that seems </v>
<v Speaker 6>necessary to make that into something </v>

1461
01:24:20.161 --> 01:24:20.590
<v Speaker 6>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's a compelling story.</v>

1462
01:24:20.750 --> 01:24:24.280
<v Speaker 2>So this is where we might disagree with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This could be a fundamental disagreement</v>

1463
01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:30.000
<v Speaker 2>because I actually don't see the problem</v>
<v Speaker 2>of nihilism the way you do or the way </v>

1464
01:24:30.461 --> 01:24:35.461
<v Speaker 2>it's advertised.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like once you rip out the fall </v>

1465
01:24:35.461 --> 01:24:38.260
<v Speaker 2>certainties and the bad evidence in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad arguments and they and they,</v>

1466
01:24:38.340 --> 01:24:41.950
<v Speaker 2>the mere dog was imposed on us by prior </v>
<v Speaker 2>generations.</v>

1467
01:24:42.820 --> 01:24:47.820
<v Speaker 2>That whole never closes safely with </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything else.</v>

1468
01:24:48.190 --> 01:24:51.040
<v Speaker 2>You have to put something in its place </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's shaped just like that.</v>

1469
01:24:51.041 --> 01:24:53.500
<v Speaker 2>Some other false certainty or some other</v>
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>

1470
01:24:54.180 --> 01:24:59.180
<v Speaker 2>I simply don't think that's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's so many things we </v>

1471
01:24:59.180 --> 01:24:59.260
<v Speaker 2>outgrow both individually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A,</v>

1472
01:24:59.261 --> 01:25:04.261
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in our own childhoods and culturally </v>

1473
01:25:04.261 --> 01:25:07.000
<v Speaker 2>that where there is no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is no void left.</v>

1474
01:25:07.030 --> 01:25:10.500
<v Speaker 2>There's no santa claus shaped void that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to fill with the</v>

1475
01:25:10.540 --> 01:25:13.570
<v Speaker 6>exact same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but people certainly experience.</v>

1476
01:25:13.700 --> 01:25:18.700
<v Speaker 2>Some people are good people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not discounting the fact that it is </v>

1477
01:25:18.700 --> 01:25:21.580
<v Speaker 2>hard to be happy in this world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we are living in a world that </v>

1478
01:25:21.580 --> 01:25:26.321
<v Speaker 2>seems designed perfectly designed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>frustrate our efforts to find permanent </v>

1479
01:25:26.661 --> 01:25:27.050
<v Speaker 2>happiness.</v>

1480
01:25:27.100 --> 01:25:29.290
<v Speaker 6>So you asked me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you put me on the spot.</v>

1481
01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:32.450
<v Speaker 2>Let,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me just add to my answer to this.</v>

1482
01:25:32.451 --> 01:25:37.451
<v Speaker 2>I just think that there's the recipe for</v>
<v Speaker 2>a good life or at least a minimal recipe</v>

1483
01:25:39.740 --> 01:25:44.740
<v Speaker 2>for a good life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that this is all that's </v>

1484
01:25:44.740 --> 01:25:44.740
<v Speaker 2>entailed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is,</v>

1485
01:25:44.740 --> 01:25:47.740
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is certainly necessary if not </v>

1486
01:25:47.740 --> 01:25:47.740
<v Speaker 2>sufficient,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to live alive.</v>

1487
01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:53.200
<v Speaker 2>That is increasingly motivated by love </v>
<v Speaker 2>and guided by reason,</v>

1488
01:25:55.580 --> 01:26:00.580
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't go very far wrong if you are </v>

1489
01:26:00.580 --> 01:26:01.080
<v Speaker 2>motivated by love and guided by reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1490
01:26:01.090 --> 01:26:02.130
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the problem is,</v>

1491
01:26:02.131 --> 01:26:02.450
<v Speaker 2>is that</v>

1492
01:26:05.890 --> 01:26:07.760
<v Speaker 8>the first thing I would say about that </v>
<v Speaker 8>is,</v>

1493
01:26:07.761 --> 01:26:08.420
<v Speaker 8>to me that's</v>

1494
01:26:08.790 --> 01:26:11.790
<v Speaker 4>a recapitulation of the judeo christian </v>
<v Speaker 4>ethic,</v>

1495
01:26:11.791 --> 01:26:12.150
<v Speaker 4>which is</v>

1496
01:26:12.730 --> 01:26:16.420
<v Speaker 8>guided by love and use logos to serve </v>
<v Speaker 8>that.</v>

1497
01:26:16.450 --> 01:26:19.050
<v Speaker 8>Then you to read the fine print on </v>
<v Speaker 8>reason,</v>

1498
01:26:19.660 --> 01:26:22.230
<v Speaker 8>say reason.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I said logos because that's the.</v>

1499
01:26:22.270 --> 01:26:25.090
<v Speaker 8>That's something that's deeper there.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Is jesus smuggling?</v>

1500
01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:26.410
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>yes,</v>

1501
01:26:26.411 --> 01:26:27.350
<v Speaker 8>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 8>definitely.</v>

1502
01:26:27.351 --> 01:26:28.170
<v Speaker 8>It would have.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

1503
01:26:28.220 --> 01:26:30.730
<v Speaker 8>So,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but so I've been,</v>

1504
01:26:30.850 --> 01:26:32.050
<v Speaker 8>I've been trying to.</v>

1505
01:26:32.260 --> 01:26:36.640
<v Speaker 4>Part of the reason that I'm doing what </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm doing is to try to address the void.</v>

1506
01:26:37.030 --> 01:26:42.030
<v Speaker 4>Let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I suspect that many of you are </v>

1507
01:26:42.030 --> 01:26:43.300
<v Speaker 4>actually here because you would like to </v>
<v Speaker 4>have the void addressed.</v>

1508
01:26:43.330 --> 01:26:46.480
<v Speaker 4>And so the way it looks to me as </v>
<v Speaker 4>something like this,</v>

1509
01:26:46.481 --> 01:26:50.560
<v Speaker 4>and this is what I've derived in part </v>
<v Speaker 4>from my studies of religious tradition.</v>

1510
01:26:50.770 --> 01:26:54.220
<v Speaker 4>So I could say that at the beginning of </v>
<v Speaker 4>genesis for example,</v>

1511
01:26:54.221 --> 01:26:59.221
<v Speaker 4>there's a proposition that it's truthful</v>
<v Speaker 4>speech that generates habitable order </v>

1512
01:26:59.710 --> 01:27:04.710
<v Speaker 4>from chaotic potential.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That seems to me to be the fundamental </v>

1513
01:27:04.710 --> 01:27:06.070
<v Speaker 4>narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I do believe there's something dead,</v>

1514
01:27:06.071 --> 01:27:11.071
<v Speaker 4>accurate and real about that because we </v>
<v Speaker 4>do generate the world as a consequence </v>

1515
01:27:11.140 --> 01:27:16.140
<v Speaker 4>of our communicative effort.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then there's a second proposition </v>

1516
01:27:16.211 --> 01:27:21.211
<v Speaker 4>which is that the world that we generate</v>
<v Speaker 4>from the chaos of potential is habitable</v>

1517
01:27:22.961 --> 01:27:27.760
<v Speaker 4>to the degree that the communication </v>
<v Speaker 4>that we engage in is truthful and that's</v>

1518
01:27:27.761 --> 01:27:32.761
<v Speaker 4>why god who uses the logo set at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>beginning of time to generate the world </v>

1519
01:27:32.761 --> 01:27:34.210
<v Speaker 4>is able to say that his creation is </v>
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>

1520
01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:39.480
<v Speaker 4>The proposition is the world you bring </v>
<v Speaker 4>into being through truthful speech is </v>

1521
01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:42.841
<v Speaker 4>good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's the image of god that's </v>

1522
01:27:42.841 --> 01:27:45.451
<v Speaker 4>implanted in man and woman and there's a</v>
<v Speaker 4>grandeur about that idea and you think,</v>

1523
01:27:46.181 --> 01:27:51.181
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't need the grand jury because </v>

1524
01:27:51.181 --> 01:27:51.181
<v Speaker 4>it's just a fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1525
01:27:51.181 --> 01:27:53.200
<v Speaker 4>just wait a second here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not just a fiction unless you don't</v>

1526
01:27:53.201 --> 01:27:58.201
<v Speaker 4>believe that in some manner you partake </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the creation of the world and that </v>

1527
01:27:58.201 --> 01:28:01.680
<v Speaker 4>you have an ultimate responsibility that</v>
<v Speaker 4>might well be described as divine to </v>

1528
01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:05.971
<v Speaker 4>participate in that process properly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>truthfully and with love.</v>

1529
01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:10.060
<v Speaker 4>And there's every reason to think that </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's an elevated ideal.</v>

1530
01:28:10.061 --> 01:28:15.061
<v Speaker 4>So high that it's worthy of </v>
<v Speaker 4>conceptualizing as divine and also to </v>

1531
01:28:15.061 --> 01:28:19.231
<v Speaker 4>presume that it represents some </v>
<v Speaker 4>fundamental metaphysical reality and </v>

1532
01:28:19.781 --> 01:28:22.420
<v Speaker 4>that's a lot more powerful than you need</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be.</v>

1533
01:28:22.421 --> 01:28:22.930
<v Speaker 4>Good.</v>

1534
01:28:23.020 --> 01:28:23.350
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1535
01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:25.160
<v Speaker 8>Problem here.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Jordan,</v>

1536
01:28:27.350 --> 01:28:29.140
<v Speaker 8>is it I,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I could do exactly</v>

1537
01:28:29.170 --> 01:28:34.170
<v Speaker 2>plea what you just did with buddhism or </v>
<v Speaker 2>hinduism and it is just as grand and </v>

1538
01:28:37.721 --> 01:28:42.721
<v Speaker 2>just as deep and just as anchored to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first person experience of </v>

1539
01:28:43.210 --> 01:28:45.940
<v Speaker 2>contemplative who have taken that as far</v>
<v Speaker 2>as they could take it,</v>

1540
01:28:45.941 --> 01:28:46.140
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1541
01:28:46.170 --> 01:28:51.170
<v Speaker 8>Well sam,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you should do that and see how people </v>

1542
01:28:51.170 --> 01:28:51.170
<v Speaker 8>respond to it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

1543
01:28:51.170 --> 01:28:51.170
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>

1544
01:28:51.170 --> 01:28:52.400
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>
<v Speaker 8>because I don't know.</v>

1545
01:28:52.401 --> 01:28:52.840
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>because I</v>

1546
01:28:53.010 --> 01:28:58.010
<v Speaker 2>at the end of the end of the game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't arrive where I want to get </v>

1547
01:28:58.010 --> 01:28:59.700
<v Speaker 2>to where we need to get to because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

1548
01:29:00.330 --> 01:29:04.530
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be two different effect.</v>

1549
01:29:04.570 --> 01:29:09.570
<v Speaker 2>It's there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are different claims ultimately </v>

1550
01:29:09.570 --> 01:29:12.381
<v Speaker 2>about the status of truth and good and </v>
<v Speaker 2>evil and if at the beginning of the </v>

1551
01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:14.220
<v Speaker 2>world and the fate of human </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness after death,</v>

1552
01:29:14.221 --> 01:29:17.760
<v Speaker 2>it is completely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely irreconcilable worldviews.</v>

1553
01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:19.310
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1554
01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:25.080
<v Speaker 2>There are hindus in the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They believe something that is totally </v>

1555
01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:26.680
<v Speaker 2>irreconcilable to what christians,</v>

1556
01:29:26.710 --> 01:29:28.630
<v Speaker 7>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't think that you can offer,</v>

1557
01:29:29.260 --> 01:29:34.260
<v Speaker 7>pardon me,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a watered down version of buddhism as a </v>

1558
01:29:34.260 --> 01:29:34.410
<v Speaker 7>consequence of psychedelic experience as</v>
<v Speaker 7>a,</v>

1559
01:29:34.690 --> 01:29:38.560
<v Speaker 7>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>as a acceptable and credible alternative</v>

1560
01:29:38.561 --> 01:29:42.550
<v Speaker 7>to the power of the fundamental founding</v>
<v Speaker 7>myths of the western culture.</v>

1561
01:29:42.650 --> 01:29:44.980
<v Speaker 7>And if you think you can try it.</v>

1562
01:29:45.050 --> 01:29:45.350
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1563
01:29:45.351 --> 01:29:46.070
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying.</v>

1564
01:29:46.310 --> 01:29:47.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm not trying that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's,</v>

1565
01:29:47.750 --> 01:29:49.670
<v Speaker 2>that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1566
01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:50.540
<v Speaker 2>that's not what I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1567
01:29:50.541 --> 01:29:51.350
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to,</v>

1568
01:29:51.460 --> 01:29:56.460
<v Speaker 2>just to get my biography straight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just the psychedelic </v>

1569
01:29:56.460 --> 01:29:56.460
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>

1570
01:29:56.460 --> 01:30:00.390
<v Speaker 7>I'm not making light of the psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 7>experience.</v>

1571
01:30:00.680 --> 01:30:03.470
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to take this.</v>

1572
01:30:04.120 --> 01:30:08.340
<v Speaker 2>We were having most of this conversation</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the side of where,</v>

1573
01:30:08.490 --> 01:30:12.110
<v Speaker 2>wherein it seems reasonable to worry </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the fate of civilization,</v>

1574
01:30:12.170 --> 01:30:17.170
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could have started at a very </v>

1575
01:30:17.170 --> 01:30:17.780
<v Speaker 2>different point with just the nature of </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness,</v>

1576
01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:19.050
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just the,</v>

1577
01:30:19.130 --> 01:30:22.730
<v Speaker 2>just the for our first person encounter </v>
<v Speaker 2>with being itself,</v>

1578
01:30:22.940 --> 01:30:23.440
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wake,</v>

1579
01:30:23.480 --> 01:30:25.730
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of us wake up each morning.</v>

1580
01:30:26.040 --> 01:30:26.560
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1581
01:30:26.860 --> 01:30:31.040
<v Speaker 2>we are thrust from a condition of deep </v>
<v Speaker 2>sleep,</v>

1582
01:30:31.070 --> 01:30:36.070
<v Speaker 2>which we seem to know nothing about and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just to push through a veil of </v>

1583
01:30:36.070 --> 01:30:41.051
<v Speaker 2>dreams into this apparently solid </v>
<v Speaker 2>reality that we call the world and we're</v>

1584
01:30:42.021 --> 01:30:47.021
<v Speaker 2>engaging one another in this space of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of just consciousness and its contents </v>

1585
01:30:47.330 --> 01:30:52.330
<v Speaker 2>and we're trying to make sense of it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>science is the best language game we </v>

1586
01:30:52.330 --> 01:30:56.891
<v Speaker 2>play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would argue in trying to make truly </v>

1587
01:30:56.891 --> 01:30:56.891
<v Speaker 2>rigorous sense of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not.</v>

1588
01:30:56.891 --> 01:30:58.610
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't exhaust all the language </v>
<v Speaker 2>games we play,</v>

1589
01:30:58.611 --> 01:31:01.880
<v Speaker 2>we play others that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are also fact based.</v>

1590
01:31:01.881 --> 01:31:05.330
<v Speaker 2>We talk about what happened historically</v>
<v Speaker 2>before we arrived here.</v>

1591
01:31:05.510 --> 01:31:10.510
<v Speaker 2>We talk about a facts as we can </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand them that we just didn't </v>

1592
01:31:10.611 --> 01:31:13.250
<v Speaker 2>witness but others did and we call that </v>
<v Speaker 2>journalism,</v>

1593
01:31:13.251 --> 01:31:14.360
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we were trying to have a.</v>

1594
01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:19.630
<v Speaker 7>It's hard,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's getting harder and harder.</v>

1595
01:31:19.870 --> 01:31:22.560
<v Speaker 2>Discern what's actually going on now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we are,</v>

1596
01:31:22.930 --> 01:31:27.930
<v Speaker 2>we are thrust into this condition of </v>
<v Speaker 2>being our apparent selves moment by </v>

1597
01:31:29.831 --> 01:31:34.831
<v Speaker 2>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we notice the difference between </v>

1598
01:31:34.831 --> 01:31:35.310
<v Speaker 2>happiness and suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1599
01:31:35.350 --> 01:31:39.130
<v Speaker 2>And this is not merely sensory is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>merely that you know,</v>

1600
01:31:39.131 --> 01:31:44.131
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like the feeling of a hot stove </v>

1601
01:31:44.131 --> 01:31:46.501
<v Speaker 2>and I do like a a warm bath.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's ideas,</v>

1602
01:31:47.470 --> 01:31:52.470
<v Speaker 2>ways of thinking about ourselves and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world can can open the door or close the</v>

1603
01:31:52.901 --> 01:31:57.901
<v Speaker 2>door to various states of happiness and </v>
<v Speaker 2>suffering and religion comes into </v>

1604
01:31:57.901 --> 01:32:02.280
<v Speaker 2>religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Leverage is people that the difference </v>

1605
01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:06.540
<v Speaker 2>between believing that your dead child </v>
<v Speaker 2>is in heaven with jesus and not being </v>

1606
01:32:07.631 --> 01:32:10.580
<v Speaker 2>able to believe that is enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1607
01:32:11.620 --> 01:32:13.260
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to ask you some specific </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

1608
01:32:14.460 --> 01:32:19.460
<v Speaker 1>You've expended it's seven amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reputational energy and much more on the</v>

1609
01:32:19.670 --> 01:32:24.670
<v Speaker 1>jihadists in your battles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we say that.</v>

1610
01:32:25.140 --> 01:32:30.140
<v Speaker 1>How much allyship to use a term have you</v>
<v Speaker 1>found from fellow secular,</v>

1611
01:32:32.760 --> 01:32:35.670
<v Speaker 1>rational people who want to love and </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason like you?</v>

1612
01:32:37.680 --> 01:32:39.330
<v Speaker 2>Well that is a leading question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

1613
01:32:40.900 --> 01:32:42.310
<v Speaker 1>I've got fingers if you need more.</v>

1614
01:32:42.420 --> 01:32:42.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1615
01:32:44.870 --> 01:32:45.830
<v Speaker 2>I know you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your,</v>

1616
01:32:46.020 --> 01:32:48.450
<v Speaker 2>your fingers are safe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1617
01:32:49.020 --> 01:32:50.480
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's.</v>

1618
01:32:50.930 --> 01:32:55.100
<v Speaker 2>But this is a problem of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't describe this to.</v>

1619
01:32:55.740 --> 01:33:00.740
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the allies you can easily find among </v>

1620
01:33:00.740 --> 01:33:05.210
<v Speaker 2>deeply religious christians say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are there for the wrong reasons,</v>

1621
01:33:05.390 --> 01:33:05.750
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1622
01:33:05.751 --> 01:33:06.920
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I can find,</v>

1623
01:33:06.921 --> 01:33:07.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1624
01:33:07.271 --> 01:33:12.070
<v Speaker 2>I know that the reason they're there for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wrong the world,</v>

1625
01:33:12.110 --> 01:33:16.190
<v Speaker 2>they see the problem clearly for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong reasons.</v>

1626
01:33:16.250 --> 01:33:20.690
<v Speaker 2>So for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I meet secular scientists types,</v>

1627
01:33:20.780 --> 01:33:25.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anthropologists say who are so far from </v>

1628
01:33:25.780 --> 01:33:30.521
<v Speaker 2>knowing what it's like to believe in </v>
<v Speaker 2>revelation that they don't believe </v>

1629
01:33:30.521 --> 01:33:31.220
<v Speaker 2>anyone else does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1630
01:33:31.221 --> 01:33:36.221
<v Speaker 2>So when you tell them that members of </v>
<v Speaker 2>isis really believe that if you die in </v>

1631
01:33:36.221 --> 01:33:40.580
<v Speaker 2>the right circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get 72 virgins and you're surrounded</v>

1632
01:33:40.581 --> 01:33:42.440
<v Speaker 2>by rivers of milk and honey and all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rest.</v>

1633
01:33:43.430 --> 01:33:46.140
<v Speaker 2>If you go into the ivory tower,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you meet people who,</v>

1634
01:33:46.210 --> 01:33:48.560
<v Speaker 2>who don't believe that anyone believes </v>
<v Speaker 2>that stuff,</v>

1635
01:33:48.561 --> 01:33:53.561
<v Speaker 2>but if you go into a mega church,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they know people believe that stuff </v>

1636
01:33:53.561 --> 01:33:53.690
<v Speaker 2>because they believe their own dogmas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1637
01:33:53.990 --> 01:33:56.210
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what it's like to be,</v>

1638
01:33:56.390 --> 01:34:00.560
<v Speaker 2>to be effortlessly right for not </v>
<v Speaker 2>especially good reasons.</v>

1639
01:34:00.620 --> 01:34:05.620
<v Speaker 2>The fact that you believe a book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that you believe a book was </v>

1640
01:34:05.620 --> 01:34:09.251
<v Speaker 2>written by god and therefore it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>trivially easy for you to understand </v>

1641
01:34:09.251 --> 01:34:11.060
<v Speaker 2>that someone else believes that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they just have the wrong book.</v>

1642
01:34:11.390 --> 01:34:16.390
<v Speaker 2>That's not the rational basis for </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding our circumstance that </v>

1643
01:34:16.390 --> 01:34:16.390
<v Speaker 2>we're looking at.</v>

1644
01:34:16.390 --> 01:34:17.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying whether one is advice and</v>
<v Speaker 1>one is wrong,</v>

1645
01:34:17.371 --> 01:34:22.371
<v Speaker 1>but one seems to have more commitment in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and in one battle you're fighting </v>

1646
01:34:22.741 --> 01:34:27.741
<v Speaker 1>commitment and may be important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and indeed it may be many reasons why </v>

1647
01:34:27.741 --> 01:34:30.300
<v Speaker 1>the people who deeply wants to love and </v>
<v Speaker 1>be rational,</v>

1648
01:34:30.690 --> 01:34:35.690
<v Speaker 1>I absolutely no damn use in that fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they want to preserve their </v>

1649
01:34:36.601 --> 01:34:39.750
<v Speaker 1>happiness a bit longer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>preserve their comfort a bit longer,</v>

1650
01:34:39.990 --> 01:34:44.130
<v Speaker 1>cannot understand people who genuinely </v>
<v Speaker 1>come from a fundamental standpoint.</v>

1651
01:34:44.310 --> 01:34:44.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1652
01:34:45.140 --> 01:34:49.250
<v Speaker 2>and then there's also other steel man </v>
<v Speaker 2>their case for a moment.</v>

1653
01:34:49.850 --> 01:34:54.850
<v Speaker 2>It is understandable to be sensitive to </v>
<v Speaker 2>and guilty about the history of </v>

1654
01:34:56.121 --> 01:35:01.121
<v Speaker 2>colonialism and the reality of racism </v>
<v Speaker 2>and to be so committed to tolerance as </v>

1655
01:35:03.561 --> 01:35:06.830
<v Speaker 2>your master virtue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's your attempted.</v>

1656
01:35:06.831 --> 01:35:11.210
<v Speaker 2>To tolerate intolerance and not </v>
<v Speaker 2>recognize it to be cowardice,</v>

1657
01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:12.200
<v Speaker 2>which in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1658
01:35:12.380 --> 01:35:17.380
<v Speaker 6>making tolerance.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Your core value is much different than </v>

1659
01:35:17.380 --> 01:35:17.380
<v Speaker 6>making truth,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your core value,</v>

1660
01:35:17.380 --> 01:35:22.170
<v Speaker 6>which is an interesting thing because,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and perhaps this is one of the places </v>

1661
01:35:22.170 --> 01:35:25.660
<v Speaker 6>where you and the fundamentalist radical</v>
<v Speaker 6>leftists sled say differ,</v>

1662
01:35:25.661 --> 01:35:29.620
<v Speaker 6>is that the core value that's emerging </v>
<v Speaker 6>there is definitely one of tolerance.</v>

1663
01:35:29.621 --> 01:35:34.621
<v Speaker 6>Whereas the core value that you espouse </v>
<v Speaker 6>is one of truth and truth and tolerance </v>

1664
01:35:34.621 --> 01:35:34.990
<v Speaker 6>are not the same thing.</v>

1665
01:35:37.480 --> 01:35:42.480
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is the pursuit of truth and the belief </v>

1666
01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:42.480
<v Speaker 1>that as a result,</v>
<v Speaker 1>truth can be found,</v>

1667
01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:45.270
<v Speaker 1>that he's not a single thing on its own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just pursue it as a hobby.</v>

1668
01:35:45.890 --> 01:35:50.890
<v Speaker 1>It's just something you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that you believe that at the end of </v>

1669
01:35:50.890 --> 01:35:50.890
<v Speaker 1>it there is a truth to be found.</v>

1670
01:35:51.910 --> 01:35:52.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1671
01:35:52.730 --> 01:35:53.940
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but doug was what?</v>

1672
01:35:54.360 --> 01:35:58.040
<v Speaker 2>What do you fear is the case here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>

1673
01:35:58.070 --> 01:36:01.950
<v Speaker 2>if there were more people like me in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>west,</v>

1674
01:36:02.490 --> 01:36:02.760
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1675
01:36:02.761 --> 01:36:03.630
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I'm the,</v>

1676
01:36:03.720 --> 01:36:08.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm the outlier here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm somehow infected by this </v>

1677
01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:12.240
<v Speaker 2>overwhelming commitment to truth and </v>
<v Speaker 2>rationality and science,</v>

1678
01:36:12.241 --> 01:36:15.210
<v Speaker 2>and yet I'm still motivated to worry </v>
<v Speaker 2>about jihad.</v>

1679
01:36:15.820 --> 01:36:16.800
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1680
01:36:16.850 --> 01:36:18.620
<v Speaker 2>you're worried that there are many </v>
<v Speaker 2>people like me who are,</v>

1681
01:36:18.860 --> 01:36:23.860
<v Speaker 6>are oblivious to the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Are you worried about it when so many </v>

1682
01:36:23.860 --> 01:36:23.860
<v Speaker 6>other people who are.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hypothetically,</v>

1683
01:36:23.860 --> 01:36:28.301
<v Speaker 6>this is the question you asked,</v>
<v Speaker 6>why are you so worried about when </v>

1684
01:36:28.301 --> 01:36:30.860
<v Speaker 6>there's so many people who are </v>
<v Speaker 6>hypothetically like you that don't seem </v>

1685
01:36:30.860 --> 01:36:30.860
<v Speaker 6>to be worried about it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1686
01:36:30.860 --> 01:36:34.760
<v Speaker 6>maybe you shouldn't be worried about it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is obviously worried</v>

1687
01:36:36.060 --> 01:36:40.590
<v Speaker 1>my worry at any rate that we may be </v>
<v Speaker 1>living in an era when we are discovering</v>

1688
01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:46.120
<v Speaker 1>that the enlightenment and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment values never went very </v>

1689
01:36:46.141 --> 01:36:51.141
<v Speaker 1>wide and didn't go terribly deep and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a very painful realization to </v>

1690
01:36:52.561 --> 01:36:57.561
<v Speaker 1>make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only do we go all around the world </v>

1691
01:36:57.561 --> 01:37:00.531
<v Speaker 1>and discover that we find that at home </v>
<v Speaker 1>it turned out not to have gone very deep</v>

1692
01:37:02.750 --> 01:37:05.330
<v Speaker 1>in this society and that's the problem.</v>

1693
01:37:05.660 --> 01:37:06.680
<v Speaker 2>It is a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1694
01:37:06.750 --> 01:37:10.880
<v Speaker 2>but hence my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my commitment to making them deeper</v>

1695
01:37:11.070 --> 01:37:15.030
<v Speaker 1>and to reiterate the point I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be very happy if it was entirely.</v>

1696
01:37:15.031 --> 01:37:19.920
<v Speaker 1>Sam harris is all the way down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd have no problem with that.</v>

1697
01:37:20.190 --> 01:37:23.730
<v Speaker 1>It's just the underneath sam harris.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hell.</v>

1698
01:37:27.240 --> 01:37:32.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm also curious to know me too well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm curious about something that has to </v>

1699
01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:32.670
<v Speaker 1>be very carefully edited</v>

1700
01:37:36.060 --> 01:37:41.060
<v Speaker 6>physically.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You outlined rationality in the service </v>

1701
01:37:41.060 --> 01:37:42.700
<v Speaker 6>of love,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like this is an interesting like I'm not</v>

1702
01:37:42.701 --> 01:37:47.701
<v Speaker 6>sure you get to get away with that </v>
<v Speaker 6>because like is it rationality or is it </v>

1703
01:37:47.701 --> 01:37:51.890
<v Speaker 6>love because I don't understand the </v>
<v Speaker 6>place in your conceptual system for love</v>

1704
01:37:51.950 --> 01:37:56.260
<v Speaker 6>given your emphasis on rationality as </v>
<v Speaker 6>the ethic of as the,</v>

1705
01:37:56.280 --> 01:38:01.280
<v Speaker 6>as the mechanism of ethics.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I would say to the degree that I </v>

1706
01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:04.971
<v Speaker 6>smuggled in jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which by the way isn't accidental in </v>

1707
01:38:04.971 --> 01:38:05.490
<v Speaker 6>some sense and I am fully conscious when</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm doing it.</v>

1708
01:38:05.930 --> 01:38:09.030
<v Speaker 6>You smuggled in love and it essentially </v>
<v Speaker 6>plays the same role.</v>

1709
01:38:09.080 --> 01:38:09.420
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1710
01:38:09.421 --> 01:38:10.360
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the love,</v>

1711
01:38:10.361 --> 01:38:13.210
<v Speaker 2>but love is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an experienced reality.</v>

1712
01:38:13.211 --> 01:38:17.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean love is a state of consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a state of and I wouldn't</v>

1713
01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:22.200
<v Speaker 8>ultimately.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's a fact that one can experience it </v>

1714
01:38:22.200 --> 01:38:24.210
<v Speaker 8>or not.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

1715
01:38:24.460 --> 01:38:26.020
<v Speaker 8>but that's not the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

1716
01:38:26.021 --> 01:38:26.440
<v Speaker 8>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

1717
01:38:26.441 --> 01:38:26.690
<v Speaker 8>it is.</v>

1718
01:38:27.070 --> 01:38:29.170
<v Speaker 6>There are artifacts that you can </v>
<v Speaker 6>experience something,</v>

1719
01:38:29.171 --> 01:38:34.171
<v Speaker 6>but their favorite you're experiencing </v>
<v Speaker 6>is there's also the thing that you're </v>

1720
01:38:34.171 --> 01:38:34.330
<v Speaker 6>experiencing as a fat.</v>

1721
01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:36.620
<v Speaker 2>What do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are facts about the,</v>

1722
01:38:36.760 --> 01:38:37.860
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1723
01:38:37.920 --> 01:38:39.790
<v Speaker 2>the range of human experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1724
01:38:39.870 --> 01:38:41.740
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not even just human,</v>

1725
01:38:41.741 --> 01:38:45.070
<v Speaker 2>just conscious experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we can build computers,</v>

1726
01:38:45.071 --> 01:38:48.850
<v Speaker 2>they can feel love and that's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>inconceivable and will either succeed in</v>

1727
01:38:48.851 --> 01:38:53.851
<v Speaker 2>doing that or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but consciousness admits of a range of </v>

1728
01:38:53.851 --> 01:38:58.351
<v Speaker 2>experiences and love is one of the best </v>
<v Speaker 2>on offer.</v>

1729
01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:05.600
<v Speaker 2>It's not the only one we care about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's the one that anchors us to a </v>

1730
01:39:05.611 --> 01:39:10.590
<v Speaker 2>positive commitment to the wellbeing of </v>
<v Speaker 2>other conscious systems and,</v>

1731
01:39:11.460 --> 01:39:15.460
<v Speaker 8>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but the crucial thing I agree with it is</v>

1732
01:39:15.480 --> 01:39:16.530
<v Speaker 8>it is a fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>okay,</v>

1733
01:39:16.590 --> 01:39:21.590
<v Speaker 2>loving someone entails a really their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their love and his counterfeits right </v>

1734
01:39:23.341 --> 01:39:24.720
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People can confuse,</v>

1735
01:39:24.721 --> 01:39:28.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>romantic attachment or lust with love.</v>

1736
01:39:28.950 --> 01:39:29.630
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I've been,</v>

1737
01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:34.640
<v Speaker 2>and the buddhists are especially good at</v>
<v Speaker 2>differentiating these various states of </v>

1738
01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:35.350
<v Speaker 2>consciousness and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1739
01:39:35.790 --> 01:39:36.510
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

1740
01:39:38.990 --> 01:39:39.920
<v Speaker 9>a,</v>

1741
01:39:41.150 --> 01:39:46.150
<v Speaker 2>this is true pleasure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mental pleasure in the company of </v>

1742
01:39:46.150 --> 01:39:49.880
<v Speaker 2>another that is colored by a commitment </v>
<v Speaker 2>to their wellbeing.</v>

1743
01:39:49.881 --> 01:39:51.920
<v Speaker 2>I wanted them to be happy and wanting </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

1744
01:39:51.980 --> 01:39:56.980
<v Speaker 2>wanting to have their hopes realize a </v>
<v Speaker 2>non zero sum commitment,</v>

1745
01:39:57.950 --> 01:39:59.590
<v Speaker 2>a or sense of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

1746
01:39:59.591 --> 01:40:04.591
<v Speaker 2>of your entanglement with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can see your failures to love </v>

1747
01:40:04.591 --> 01:40:04.610
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can be with people who you think you</v>

1748
01:40:04.611 --> 01:40:05.250
<v Speaker 2>love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know I'm,</v>

1749
01:40:05.300 --> 01:40:10.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm with my best friend say and I just </v>
<v Speaker 2>find out something fantastic has </v>

1750
01:40:10.300 --> 01:40:13.550
<v Speaker 2>happened for him and let's say in his </v>
<v Speaker 2>career and I feel a moment of envy.</v>

1751
01:40:13.640 --> 01:40:14.600
<v Speaker 2>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well then you see,</v>

1752
01:40:14.601 --> 01:40:14.990
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1753
01:40:15.030 --> 01:40:20.030
<v Speaker 2>well how much do you love this person?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If your first reaction to something good</v>

1754
01:40:20.451 --> 01:40:23.330
<v Speaker 2>happening to them is you feel poorer for</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1755
01:40:23.510 --> 01:40:25.340
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the cain and abel story.</v>

1756
01:40:25.370 --> 01:40:26.140
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1757
01:40:26.290 --> 01:40:31.290
<v Speaker 2>so this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are all kinds of different facts </v>

1758
01:40:31.290 --> 01:40:31.660
<v Speaker 2>you can witness in your own mind and </v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

1759
01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:34.670
<v Speaker 2>you pay enough attention to the nature </v>
<v Speaker 2>to what it's like to be you.</v>

1760
01:40:34.970 --> 01:40:37.670
<v Speaker 2>The full horror show of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of yeah.</v>

1761
01:40:37.680 --> 01:40:42.290
<v Speaker 2>And almost biblical unwinding of all </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibility is available,</v>

1762
01:40:42.350 --> 01:40:43.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's.</v>

1763
01:40:43.220 --> 01:40:46.190
<v Speaker 2>And you add psychedelics to that </v>
<v Speaker 2>cocktail and it,</v>

1764
01:40:46.220 --> 01:40:47.390
<v Speaker 2>it gets even more vivid.</v>

1765
01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:49.390
<v Speaker 8>So,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so are you saying,</v>

1766
01:40:49.860 --> 01:40:54.040
<v Speaker 8>but the frame that that's like these are</v>
<v Speaker 8>about the human</v>

1767
01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:59.040
<v Speaker 2>mind and it is also factual to say that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it is possible to navigate in this </v>

1768
01:40:59.801 --> 01:41:04.801
<v Speaker 2>space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is possible to design institutions </v>

1769
01:41:04.801 --> 01:41:09.271
<v Speaker 2>and s and social systems and ethical </v>
<v Speaker 2>commitments that help us navigate in </v>

1770
01:41:09.271 --> 01:41:14.251
<v Speaker 2>this space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that we all have to get up </v>

1771
01:41:14.251 --> 01:41:16.141
<v Speaker 2>every morning naked and try to rebuild </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization and all of human wisdom for</v>

1772
01:41:18.611 --> 01:41:21.280
<v Speaker 2>ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Each day you we inherit.</v>

1773
01:41:21.310 --> 01:41:23.710
<v Speaker 2>We inherit the most useful tool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tools.</v>

1774
01:41:23.711 --> 01:41:28.711
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to figure this all out </v>
<v Speaker 2>for yourself and my my appeal to you is </v>

1775
01:41:28.711 --> 01:41:33.631
<v Speaker 2>that what we should want to use all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>best tools available without </v>

1776
01:41:36.911 --> 01:41:41.911
<v Speaker 2>hamstringing ourselves by this notion </v>
<v Speaker 2>that certain tools are must be the best </v>

1777
01:41:43.331 --> 01:41:48.331
<v Speaker 2>for all time or certain books must be </v>
<v Speaker 2>read it on every page with equals </v>

1778
01:41:49.920 --> 01:41:54.920
<v Speaker 2>diligence because it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This book came from the creator of the </v>

1779
01:41:54.920 --> 01:41:56.170
<v Speaker 2>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When we're reading marcus aurelius,</v>

1780
01:41:56.320 --> 01:41:59.950
<v Speaker 2>if he gets something catastrophic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lee wrong on page 17,</v>

1781
01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:00.940
<v Speaker 2>we say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1782
01:42:00.941 --> 01:42:03.220
<v Speaker 2>what the hell?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He he lived 2000 years ago.</v>

1783
01:42:03.221 --> 01:42:06.160
<v Speaker 2>There's no way he knew everything right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we turn the page</v>

1784
01:42:06.380 --> 01:42:11.370
<v Speaker 7>so we can't do that with the bible and </v>
<v Speaker 7>the mythological representation of that.</v>

1785
01:42:12.420 --> 01:42:16.660
<v Speaker 7>So there's an ancient idea,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a very ancient,</v>

1786
01:42:16.661 --> 01:42:16.770
<v Speaker 7>okay</v>

1787
01:42:16.790 --> 01:42:21.790
<v Speaker 6>idea that when you face the void,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what you do is confronted and leap into </v>

1788
01:42:21.911 --> 01:42:24.580
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and what you discover at the bottom is a</v>

1789
01:42:24.581 --> 01:42:29.581
<v Speaker 6>beast.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And inside that beast you discover your </v>

1790
01:42:29.581 --> 01:42:29.581
<v Speaker 6>father die,</v>
<v Speaker 6>lying dead,</v>

1791
01:42:29.581 --> 01:42:32.200
<v Speaker 6>and then you re animate your father and </v>
<v Speaker 6>you bring them back to the surface.</v>

1792
01:42:32.201 --> 01:42:35.020
<v Speaker 6>And that's the means of dealing with the</v>
<v Speaker 6>void,</v>

1793
01:42:35.650 --> 01:42:36.830
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so in,</v>

1794
01:42:37.090 --> 01:42:38.470
<v Speaker 6>in essence,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in some sense,</v>

1795
01:42:38.471 --> 01:42:41.200
<v Speaker 6>that's just what you said.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You said that</v>

1796
01:42:41.340 --> 01:42:43.410
<v Speaker 2>if we accept that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1797
01:42:43.411 --> 01:42:48.340
<v Speaker 2>this is something confabulatory about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that because you can do.</v>

1798
01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:54.080
<v Speaker 2>I could change the valence of virtually </v>
<v Speaker 2>every word you use there and it would </v>

1799
01:42:54.420 --> 01:42:57.180
<v Speaker 2>also sound profound and true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could,</v>

1800
01:42:57.390 --> 01:43:01.750
<v Speaker 2>I could swap father for mother and I got</v>
<v Speaker 2>swapped void from mountain top and I and</v>

1801
01:43:01.751 --> 01:43:06.751
<v Speaker 2>I could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be the same seemingly </v>

1802
01:43:06.751 --> 01:43:06.751
<v Speaker 2>archetypal journey</v>

1803
01:43:06.751 --> 01:43:08.370
<v Speaker 7>and it makes sense of.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's not that easy,</v>

1804
01:43:08.371 --> 01:43:10.200
<v Speaker 7>sam.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like that's the same fast,</v>

1805
01:43:10.201 --> 01:43:11.550
<v Speaker 7>easy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've done it with a cookbook,</v>

1806
01:43:11.960 --> 01:43:13.920
<v Speaker 7>but look,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if it's that easy,</v>

1807
01:43:13.921 --> 01:43:18.770
<v Speaker 7>then you can write great novels,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no story there other either it's not the</v>

1808
01:43:18.771 --> 01:43:23.760
<v Speaker 7>ability to write a great story so these </v>
<v Speaker 7>things can be swapped out with these and</v>

1809
01:43:23.761 --> 01:43:28.761
<v Speaker 7>there is a reason that it's your father </v>
<v Speaker 7>that you rescue from the belly of the </v>

1810
01:43:28.761 --> 01:43:29.710
<v Speaker 7>beast and not your mother in those sorts</v>
<v Speaker 7>of situations it,</v>

1811
01:43:29.740 --> 01:43:29.910
<v Speaker 7>but</v>

1812
01:43:31.740 --> 01:43:36.740
<v Speaker 2>give you a buddhism and hinduism that ha</v>
<v Speaker 2>that have completely different </v>

1813
01:43:36.740 --> 01:43:38.100
<v Speaker 2>iconography is and mythologies.</v>

1814
01:43:38.450 --> 01:43:39.860
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're different levels,</v>

1815
01:43:39.861 --> 01:43:43.150
<v Speaker 7>but not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like languages levels or not.</v>

1816
01:43:43.530 --> 01:43:43.700
<v Speaker 7>They're</v>

1817
01:43:43.710 --> 01:43:46.440
<v Speaker 2>crucially opposite in many of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>cases.</v>

1818
01:43:46.441 --> 01:43:51.441
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying that this kind of of of </v>
<v Speaker 2>reading meaning into story is there's a </v>

1819
01:43:53.451 --> 01:43:58.451
<v Speaker 2>reason why it's not science because it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it is in some basic sense </v>

1820
01:43:58.451 --> 01:44:02.981
<v Speaker 2>unfalsifiable there's nothing you and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>can do for the rest of our lives to be </v>

1821
01:44:02.981 --> 01:44:05.920
<v Speaker 2>sure that the mother isn't at the bottom</v>
<v Speaker 2>of that void and it's really the problem</v>

1822
01:44:05.970 --> 01:44:09.150
<v Speaker 5>to develop a factual approach to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>analysis of literature.</v>

1823
01:44:09.800 --> 01:44:11.060
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

1824
01:44:11.061 --> 01:44:12.620
<v Speaker 2>on its own terms you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1825
01:44:12.910 --> 01:44:17.910
<v Speaker 2>but that that extends to things like it </v>
<v Speaker 2>is a fact that hamlet was the prince of </v>

1826
01:44:17.991 --> 01:44:18.710
<v Speaker 2>Denmark</v>

1827
01:44:18.820 --> 01:44:21.190
<v Speaker 5>and not for me in terms of the meaning </v>
<v Speaker 5>of literature.</v>

1828
01:44:21.280 --> 01:44:21.590
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1829
01:44:22.280 --> 01:44:27.280
<v Speaker 2>you can make true and false claims or </v>
<v Speaker 2>more and less plausible claims about </v>

1830
01:44:27.280 --> 01:44:30.490
<v Speaker 2>literature trying to do more defects on </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1831
01:44:30.930 --> 01:44:35.930
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is a very different game than </v>

1832
01:44:35.930 --> 01:44:35.930
<v Speaker 2>what most religious people think is on </v>
<v Speaker 2>offer.</v>

1833
01:44:36.260 --> 01:44:36.830
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

1834
01:44:36.831 --> 01:44:40.250
<v Speaker 5>if you look at the domain of science,</v>
<v Speaker 5>most scientists aren't very good at what</v>

1835
01:44:40.251 --> 01:44:43.040
<v Speaker 5>they do and if you look at the domain of</v>
<v Speaker 5>religious thinking,</v>

1836
01:44:43.041 --> 01:44:45.500
<v Speaker 5>most religious thinking people aren't </v>
<v Speaker 5>very good at what they do,</v>

1837
01:44:45.501 --> 01:44:48.620
<v Speaker 5>but that doesn't mean that the whole </v>
<v Speaker 5>damn thing should be thrown out.</v>

1838
01:44:48.650 --> 01:44:51.890
<v Speaker 5>There's tons of religious revelation and</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

1839
01:44:51.990 --> 01:44:53.060
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and wisdom,</v>

1840
01:44:53.370 --> 01:44:58.370
<v Speaker 2>but there's that word revelation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Revelation is something that we can all </v>

1841
01:44:58.781 --> 01:45:00.490
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

1842
01:45:00.910 --> 01:45:02.950
<v Speaker 2>me and marcus aurelius,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1843
01:45:03.490 --> 01:45:08.490
<v Speaker 2>That is a very different world than the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world that muslims think they're living </v>

1844
01:45:08.490 --> 01:45:08.490
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

1845
01:45:08.490 --> 01:45:09.600
<v Speaker 5>But you just said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sam,</v>

1846
01:45:09.601 --> 01:45:14.601
<v Speaker 5>that we have to go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this is why I used the going down </v>

1847
01:45:14.601 --> 01:45:14.940
<v Speaker 5>into the void to rescue your father </v>
<v Speaker 5>metaphor.</v>

1848
01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:20.120
<v Speaker 5>You just said that we have to and you've</v>
<v Speaker 5>said this before and I know you believe </v>

1849
01:45:20.120 --> 01:45:23.421
<v Speaker 5>it as well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that we have to go back into the past </v>

1850
01:45:23.421 --> 01:45:26.990
<v Speaker 5>and find the wisdom that can help guide </v>
<v Speaker 5>us because we don't have to do this as </v>

1851
01:45:26.990 --> 01:45:31.821
<v Speaker 5>if we're encountering everything for the</v>
<v Speaker 5>first time and that's exactly the idea </v>

1852
01:45:31.821 --> 01:45:32.970
<v Speaker 5>of going into the void to rescue your </v>
<v Speaker 5>father.</v>

1853
01:45:33.180 --> 01:45:36.000
<v Speaker 5>That's how that in that is the eternal </v>
<v Speaker 5>age.</v>

1854
01:45:36.001 --> 01:45:40.650
<v Speaker 5>Old medication for the confrontation of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the void and you said it yourself and so</v>

1855
01:45:40.651 --> 01:45:41.910
<v Speaker 5>I don't know which it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

1856
01:45:42.120 --> 01:45:46.650
<v Speaker 5>do we have to go into the past to rescue</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's best given the understanding that</v>

1857
01:45:46.651 --> 01:45:49.770
<v Speaker 5>there is something there worth rescuing </v>
<v Speaker 5>or not?</v>

1858
01:45:50.010 --> 01:45:52.800
<v Speaker 5>Is it pure rationality and nothing else </v>
<v Speaker 5>moving forward?</v>

1859
01:45:52.850 --> 01:45:55.080
<v Speaker 5>They are unconstrained by convention.</v>

1860
01:45:55.130 --> 01:45:57.560
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just again,</v>

1861
01:45:57.561 --> 01:46:02.561
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's I want our certainties and I think </v>

1862
01:46:02.561 --> 01:46:06.530
<v Speaker 2>we all in every other area of our lives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we agree about this effortlessly,</v>

1863
01:46:06.680 --> 01:46:07.100
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I,</v>

1864
01:46:07.130 --> 01:46:11.270
<v Speaker 2>if I'm pretending to be certain of </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that you can sense,</v>

1865
01:46:11.271 --> 01:46:14.820
<v Speaker 2>I have no good reason to be certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>about you begin to miss,</v>

1866
01:46:14.840 --> 01:46:19.840
<v Speaker 2>trust me in every area if it's in </v>
<v Speaker 2>business or if it's in sports or if I </v>

1867
01:46:20.811 --> 01:46:25.811
<v Speaker 2>told you I knew that France was going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>win the world cup and I was absolutely </v>

1868
01:46:25.811 --> 01:46:25.811
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1869
01:46:25.811 --> 01:46:28.370
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and yet I magically didn't bet any money</v>

1870
01:46:28.371 --> 01:46:29.310
<v Speaker 2>on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1871
01:46:29.770 --> 01:46:30.440
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are,</v>

1872
01:46:30.441 --> 01:46:32.900
<v Speaker 2>these are conversations we can have that</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything else.</v>

1873
01:46:33.110 --> 01:46:37.130
<v Speaker 2>And yet on this topic of religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people change the rules,</v>

1874
01:46:37.310 --> 01:46:37.930
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm,</v>

1875
01:46:37.931 --> 01:46:40.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm just arguing that the rules should </v>
<v Speaker 2>never.</v>

1876
01:46:40.340 --> 01:46:45.340
<v Speaker 2>The rules of by which we dole out our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our credence shouldn't change.</v>

1877
01:46:47.680 --> 01:46:49.740
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if they don't change,</v>

1878
01:46:50.720 --> 01:46:51.320
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1879
01:46:51.321 --> 01:46:54.930
<v Speaker 2>it's we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we couldn't be misled by the,</v>

1880
01:46:55.110 --> 01:46:58.110
<v Speaker 2>the duration of the past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe this is what's,</v>

1881
01:46:58.460 --> 01:47:00.330
<v Speaker 2>this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1882
01:47:01.050 --> 01:47:06.050
<v Speaker 2>the comparison of something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientology to christianity is so </v>

1883
01:47:06.050 --> 01:47:10.170
<v Speaker 2>invidious because we can practically </v>
<v Speaker 2>meet l ron hubbard,</v>

1884
01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:11.760
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got film of him.</v>

1885
01:47:11.890 --> 01:47:15.870
<v Speaker 2>It confabulating about galaxies that </v>
<v Speaker 2>rule ruled by,</v>

1886
01:47:15.930 --> 01:47:18.630
<v Speaker 2>by overlords,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whose names he magically knew,</v>

1887
01:47:18.690 --> 01:47:19.480
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

1888
01:47:19.540 --> 01:47:21.960
<v Speaker 2>we see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we see the man behind the curtain,</v>

1889
01:47:22.440 --> 01:47:25.930
<v Speaker 2>we don't see that with the apostle paul </v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

1890
01:47:25.940 --> 01:47:28.000
<v Speaker 2>or anyone else who brought us the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1891
01:47:28.090 --> 01:47:29.940
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the quote real religions,</v>

1892
01:47:30.360 --> 01:47:34.440
<v Speaker 2>and yet it's always just been human </v>
<v Speaker 2>beings doing this.</v>

1893
01:47:34.710 --> 01:47:35.160
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1894
01:47:35.161 --> 01:47:37.110
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you go back far enough,</v>

1895
01:47:37.111 --> 01:47:42.111
<v Speaker 2>they were doing it in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a situation that was completely </v>

1896
01:47:42.111 --> 01:47:45.621
<v Speaker 2>uncontaminated by the kinds of concerns </v>
<v Speaker 2>we have as scientists and secular </v>

1897
01:47:45.991 --> 01:47:50.991
<v Speaker 2>rational people for evidence and </v>
<v Speaker 2>consistency and a knowledge of the past.</v>

1898
01:47:51.121 --> 01:47:54.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean they had nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had no mechanism by which to record</v>

1899
01:47:54.480 --> 01:47:55.800
<v Speaker 2>their observations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1900
01:47:56.300 --> 01:47:58.140
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to interrupt you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1901
01:47:58.490 --> 01:48:02.210
<v Speaker 1>because festival.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was signed saying five minutes and I'm</v>

1902
01:48:02.211 --> 01:48:07.211
<v Speaker 1>very conscious of a number of things </v>
<v Speaker 1>apart from my own silence and we had a </v>

1903
01:48:12.021 --> 01:48:17.021
<v Speaker 1>long a session on love just then and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>refuse to finish this evening on such a </v>

1904
01:48:18.741 --> 01:48:23.741
<v Speaker 1>positive note and I'd like to turn that </v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

1905
01:48:24.050 --> 01:48:29.050
<v Speaker 1>We're all in agreement on certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspects if we speech civilized discourse</v>

1906
01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:35.150
<v Speaker 1>on the most important matters and much </v>
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>

1907
01:48:36.320 --> 01:48:38.900
<v Speaker 1>but there's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure a lot we have in common of what</v>

1908
01:48:38.901 --> 01:48:43.901
<v Speaker 1>we just can't bear and I just wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hand over to both of you at some point </v>

1909
01:48:44.850 --> 01:48:48.920
<v Speaker 1>to give an idea not of your loves of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your present hates.</v>

1910
01:48:49.280 --> 01:48:49.700
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

1911
01:48:51.480 --> 01:48:52.140
<v Speaker 2>That's Jordan.</v>

1912
01:49:05.340 --> 01:49:05.960
<v Speaker 1>Hate.</v>

1913
01:49:09.780 --> 01:49:13.220
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would say did.</v>

1914
01:49:13.221 --> 01:49:18.221
<v Speaker 6>I spent a lot of time over the last 30 </v>
<v Speaker 6>years trying to understand the part of </v>

1915
01:49:22.521 --> 01:49:27.521
<v Speaker 6>me that can be deeply satisfied as an </v>
<v Speaker 6>auschwitz prison guard and I would say </v>

1916
01:49:29.960 --> 01:49:34.960
<v Speaker 6>that that part is something that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>worthy of hate and I think the best way </v>

1917
01:49:39.721 --> 01:49:44.721
<v Speaker 6>to overcome it is to recognize it in </v>
<v Speaker 6>yourself and to do everything possible</v>

1918
01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:54.360
<v Speaker 4>to constrain it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's what's given me an </v>

1919
01:49:54.360 --> 01:49:59.130
<v Speaker 4>overwhelming horror.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Both of the nihilistic void and the </v>

1920
01:50:01.451 --> 01:50:06.451
<v Speaker 4>catastrophes of totalitarianism and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>reason that I've turned to the degree </v>

1921
01:50:07.091 --> 01:50:10.960
<v Speaker 4>that I have to the analysis of religious</v>
<v Speaker 4>traditions,</v>

1922
01:50:12.040 --> 01:50:17.040
<v Speaker 4>not losing my scientific perspective in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the meantime is because I've done </v>

1923
01:50:17.171 --> 01:50:22.171
<v Speaker 4>everything I could to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to extract out the wisdom necessary to </v>

1924
01:50:26.601 --> 01:50:31.601
<v Speaker 4>understand how to deal with that bit of </v>
<v Speaker 4>unredeemed evil that every bit of us </v>

1925
01:50:31.601 --> 01:50:31.601
<v Speaker 4>possess</v>

1926
01:50:39.900 --> 01:50:43.240
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

1927
01:50:44.290 --> 01:50:49.290
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say that I hate unnecessary </v>

1928
01:50:49.290 --> 01:50:52.840
<v Speaker 2>suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially my capacity for it.</v>

1929
01:50:53.140 --> 01:50:57.970
<v Speaker 2>And I see so much of my time conscious </v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

1930
01:50:57.971 --> 01:51:02.971
<v Speaker 2>moment to moment devoted to this </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience that should be familiar to </v>

1931
01:51:03.671 --> 01:51:08.671
<v Speaker 2>all of you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which has to be captured by thoughts of </v>

1932
01:51:08.671 --> 01:51:10.690
<v Speaker 2>the past or the future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are,</v>

1933
01:51:11.480 --> 01:51:16.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which almost by definition have a </v>

1934
01:51:17.680 --> 01:51:22.680
<v Speaker 2>mediocrity so transcendent that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>just a,</v>

1935
01:51:22.950 --> 01:51:24.000
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1936
01:51:24.920 --> 01:51:29.920
<v Speaker 2>it is what makes human life just a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just pure monotony and pettiness and,</v>

1937
01:51:33.220 --> 01:51:38.220
<v Speaker 2>and everything that religion advertises </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself as a corrective to.</v>

1938
01:51:38.570 --> 01:51:41.080
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what I'm sensitive to is that someone</v>

1939
01:51:41.081 --> 01:51:44.670
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you could tube when he came to.</v>

1940
01:51:45.130 --> 01:51:47.620
<v Speaker 2>This is osama bin laden's favorite </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosopher,</v>

1941
01:51:48.140 --> 01:51:49.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he came to America in the,</v>

1942
01:51:49.940 --> 01:51:54.940
<v Speaker 2>in the fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he saw his hosts and their neighbors </v>

1943
01:51:54.940 --> 01:51:56.080
<v Speaker 2>spending all their time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1944
01:51:56.180 --> 01:52:01.180
<v Speaker 2>bragging about how well mowed their </v>
<v Speaker 2>lawns were and what just what new </v>

1945
01:52:01.180 --> 01:52:04.330
<v Speaker 2>chevrolets they had purchased,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he looked at all of this as just,</v>

1946
01:52:04.350 --> 01:52:09.350
<v Speaker 2>it's just the quintessence of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of desecration and lost opportunity and </v>

1947
01:52:11.350 --> 01:52:15.100
<v Speaker 2>the lack of profundity and for which for</v>
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>

1948
01:52:15.200 --> 01:52:20.200
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the corrective obviously was islam and </v>

1949
01:52:20.200 --> 01:52:21.070
<v Speaker 2>half of that is right.</v>

1950
01:52:21.100 --> 01:52:26.100
<v Speaker 2>How it's possible to be totally </v>
<v Speaker 2>captivated by the wrong things in this </v>

1951
01:52:26.100 --> 01:52:30.421
<v Speaker 2>life and to make yourself not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So obviously being a guard at auschwitz </v>

1952
01:52:31.480 --> 01:52:36.480
<v Speaker 2>with a clear conscience is the extreme </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the extreme states of happiness.</v>

1953
01:52:36.660 --> 01:52:37.090
<v Speaker 2>What was that?</v>

1954
01:52:37.630 --> 01:52:39.720
<v Speaker 4>Or being a guard at auschwitz with </v>
<v Speaker 4>happiness.</v>

1955
01:52:39.830 --> 01:52:40.580
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1956
01:52:40.581 --> 01:52:41.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have a worth still.</v>

1957
01:52:41.780 --> 01:52:44.150
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the extreme case.</v>

1958
01:52:44.151 --> 01:52:46.780
<v Speaker 2>Enter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to realize that is that,</v>

1959
01:52:46.900 --> 01:52:50.920
<v Speaker 2>that that job was not only filled by </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychopaths,</v>

1960
01:52:51.230 --> 01:52:53.030
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That it's psychologically normal.</v>

1961
01:52:53.031 --> 01:52:55.790
<v Speaker 2>People could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could be brought to that point.</v>

1962
01:52:55.910 --> 01:52:56.540
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1963
01:52:56.560 --> 01:52:58.940
<v Speaker 2>I recognize that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the situation we're in,</v>

1964
01:52:59.300 --> 01:53:04.300
<v Speaker 2>but most of us live our lives in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>different place where it's just </v>

1965
01:53:04.490 --> 01:53:09.490
<v Speaker 2>mediocrity and pettiness and an egg and </v>
<v Speaker 2>needless anxiety and very dimly.</v>

1966
01:53:12.261 --> 01:53:15.830
<v Speaker 2>We recognize the possibility of </v>
<v Speaker 2>overcoming that on a day to day basis.</v>

1967
01:53:15.831 --> 01:53:17.800
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1968
01:53:18.110 --> 01:53:21.890
<v Speaker 2>honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the atheism,</v>

1969
01:53:21.920 --> 01:53:24.830
<v Speaker 2>the lack of belief,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lack of faith in an afterlife,</v>

1970
01:53:24.831 --> 01:53:29.831
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lack of the lack of belief in the </v>

1971
01:53:29.831 --> 01:53:32.381
<v Speaker 2>notion that you get everything you want </v>
<v Speaker 2>or make it everything you want to after </v>

1972
01:53:32.381 --> 01:53:35.471
<v Speaker 2>you die and helps leads,</v>
<v Speaker 2>leads to greater depth rather than to </v>

1973
01:53:39.650 --> 01:53:41.000
<v Speaker 2>superficiality.</v>

1974
01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:41.390
<v Speaker 2>Here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1975
01:53:41.391 --> 01:53:43.990
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I kiss my daughter's good night,</v>

1976
01:53:44.630 --> 01:53:49.630
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is with the understanding that I may </v>

1977
01:53:49.791 --> 01:53:51.530
<v Speaker 2>never see them again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1978
01:53:51.531 --> 01:53:56.531
<v Speaker 2>It's not with the assumption that if the</v>
<v Speaker 2>roof caves in will all be reunited and </v>

1979
01:53:57.021 --> 01:53:59.630
<v Speaker 2>heaven will along with our pets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1980
01:53:59.960 --> 01:54:03.410
<v Speaker 2>Which is what many people find consoling</v>
<v Speaker 2>about faith.</v>

1981
01:54:04.360 --> 01:54:05.830
<v Speaker 2>But that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1982
01:54:05.990 --> 01:54:10.790
<v Speaker 2>and so what I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I hate in myself and what I hate in</v>

1983
01:54:11.270 --> 01:54:16.270
<v Speaker 2>our culture is everything conspires to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make the preciousness and,</v>

1984
01:54:17.380 --> 01:54:21.440
<v Speaker 2>and sacredness of the present moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Difficult to realize.</v>

1985
01:54:21.800 --> 01:54:23.180
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I,</v>

1986
01:54:23.240 --> 01:54:24.730
<v Speaker 2>that's the tide against which I</v>

1987
01:54:24.850 --> 01:54:29.850
<v Speaker 10>keep looking.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I'm,</v>

1988
01:54:31.650 --> 01:54:34.280
<v Speaker 10>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I'm not gonna answer my own question</v>

1989
01:54:34.920 --> 01:54:39.300
<v Speaker 1>primarily because of the length of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>list and the knowledge of the time.</v>

1990
01:54:41.220 --> 01:54:46.220
<v Speaker 1>But I would say that if there's one </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing I hated the fact that a </v>

1991
01:54:46.220 --> 01:54:50.570
<v Speaker 1>conversations like this civil discussion</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the most important matters between </v>

1992
01:54:52.501 --> 01:54:57.501
<v Speaker 1>people who have enormous amounts in </v>
<v Speaker 1>common and have important disagreements </v>

1993
01:54:57.501 --> 01:55:02.300
<v Speaker 1>which engaged with the past and which </v>
<v Speaker 1>are going to be facilitated for a long </v>

1994
01:55:02.881 --> 01:55:07.881
<v Speaker 1>time by a knowledge of all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary progress we're about to </v>

1995
01:55:07.881 --> 01:55:11.421
<v Speaker 1>hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That can take place in an arena like </v>

1996
01:55:11.421 --> 01:55:15.201
<v Speaker 1>this with an audience like you who have </v>
<v Speaker 1>all come out and now set sat here for </v>

1997
01:55:18.750 --> 01:55:20.520
<v Speaker 1>two hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1998
01:55:20.820 --> 01:55:24.330
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's at any rate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for my point of view,</v>

1999
01:55:24.331 --> 01:55:28.890
<v Speaker 1>one of the most positive things I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine in the world at the moment</v>

2000
01:55:29.340 --> 01:55:33.410
<v Speaker 10>that an evening like this is happening </v>
<v Speaker 10>with an audience like you.</v>

2001
01:55:38.630 --> 01:55:40.310
<v Speaker 10>Unless either of you want to say </v>
<v Speaker 10>anything.</v>

2002
01:55:40.990 --> 01:55:41.810
<v Speaker 10>I think on behalf of them,</v>

2003
01:55:41.870 --> 01:55:46.870
<v Speaker 1>all of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just to say what a thrill this is for </v>

2004
01:55:46.870 --> 01:55:50.391
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And thank you to you and I hope that </v>

2005
01:55:50.391 --> 01:55:55.011
<v Speaker 1>this is an example of a constructive </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion of a kind that might even at </v>

2006
01:55:55.171 --> 01:55:58.290
<v Speaker 1>some point catch on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So thank you.</v>

2007
01:55:59.560 --> 01:56:00.340
<v Speaker 3>You</v>

2008
01:56:01.260 --> 01:56:04.590
<v Speaker 1>put your hands together for sam harris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jordan Peterson,</v>

2009
01:56:04.591 --> 01:56:05.610
<v Speaker 1>and Douglas Murray.</v>

2010
01:56:05.760 --> 01:56:06.430
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
