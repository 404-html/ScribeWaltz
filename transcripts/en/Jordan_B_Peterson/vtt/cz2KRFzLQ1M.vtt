1
00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.740
<v Speaker 1>I want to tell you a story now</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it has these characters in it and so</v>

2
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.420
<v Speaker 1>this is a very important story and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets,</v>

3
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.430
<v Speaker 1>it's called the Enuma elish and it's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mesopotamian creation myth and it's</v>

4
00:00:17.431 --> 00:00:19.770
<v Speaker 1>important for a bunch of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

5
00:00:19.771 --> 00:00:21.480
<v Speaker 1>it's the oldest written story we know</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

6
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.830
<v Speaker 1>but it's also a Middle Eastern story and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole.</v>

7
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.380
<v Speaker 1>All the Abrahamic religions emerged out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Middle East and so it's a</v>

8
00:00:34.081 --> 00:00:37.800
<v Speaker 1>foundational story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a story that sits at the bottom of</v>

9
00:00:37.801 --> 00:00:39.780
<v Speaker 1>our culture now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has.</v>

10
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.340
<v Speaker 1>It has similarities to the creation</v>
<v Speaker 1>story in genesis,</v>

11
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.950
<v Speaker 1>whether the creation story in genesis</v>
<v Speaker 1>was derived from it or whether there was</v>

12
00:00:49.951 --> 00:00:53.250
<v Speaker 1>a whole variety of similar stories</v>
<v Speaker 1>floating around in the Middle East and</v>

13
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.720
<v Speaker 1>at the same time that we're very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a theme we don't really know,</v>

14
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.290
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it really matters.</v>

15
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.330
<v Speaker 1>We don't know how old the story is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know how old it is in its written</v>

16
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:10.650
<v Speaker 1>form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

17
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.380
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's thousands of years old and it's</v>

18
00:01:13.381 --> 00:01:16.520
<v Speaker 1>written for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's 10,000 years old.</v>

19
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.880
<v Speaker 1>It's written for him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but probably not.</v>

20
00:01:17.881 --> 00:01:22.881
<v Speaker 1>It's probably more like 5,000 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the thing is is that a 5,000 year</v>

21
00:01:23.191 --> 00:01:26.940
<v Speaker 1>old story is a lot that's written is way</v>
<v Speaker 1>older than 5,000 years.</v>

22
00:01:26.941 --> 00:01:30.990
<v Speaker 1>Like we're used to being in an</v>
<v Speaker 1>environment where there's a million</v>

23
00:01:30.991 --> 00:01:32.250
<v Speaker 1>stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

24
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.160
<v Speaker 1>because we have books and movies and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>of these things,</v>

25
00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:36.020
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

26
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.940
<v Speaker 1>in slower moving and more archaic</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultures,</v>

27
00:01:38.941 --> 00:01:41.430
<v Speaker 1>especially ones that are just just have</v>
<v Speaker 1>an oral tradition.</v>

28
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.760
<v Speaker 1>It's not like there's a million stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like 20 canonical stories and</v>

29
00:01:47.101 --> 00:01:50.370
<v Speaker 1>God only knows how old they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was evidence,</v>

30
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.730
<v Speaker 1>linguistic evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just saw a study on this last week.</v>

31
00:01:53.731 --> 00:01:58.470
<v Speaker 1>Someone sent it to me showing that some</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the fairytales that the grimm</v>

32
00:01:58.471 --> 00:02:01.680
<v Speaker 1>brothers gathered might be 10,000 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>old.</v>

33
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.460
<v Speaker 1>And that doesn't surprise me because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

34
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.620
<v Speaker 1>the kind of depth that's in a good fairy</v>
<v Speaker 1>tale is so the depth is so</v>

35
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.350
<v Speaker 1>the profundity is so deep that there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>no way that someone could just contract</v>

36
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.393
<v Speaker 1>it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

37
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.640
<v Speaker 1>100 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's layers and layers and layers of</v>

38
00:02:20.641 --> 00:02:24.700
<v Speaker 1>meaning and they're basically archetipal</v>
<v Speaker 1>and religious in significance.</v>

39
00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.970
<v Speaker 1>And a Hansel and Gretel story is a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>example of that.</v>

40
00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.450
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sleeping beauty is a good example of</v>

41
00:02:30.451 --> 00:02:32.430
<v Speaker 1>that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the canonical fairytales are,</v>

42
00:02:32.431 --> 00:02:33.900
<v Speaker 1>they're very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very powerful.</v>

43
00:02:33.901 --> 00:02:36.000
<v Speaker 1>They pack a lot of meaning into a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>short</v>

44
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.900
<v Speaker 1>and do a very limited amount of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

45
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.250
<v Speaker 1>So it was great that this was an arrest</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was only on earth in the late 18</v>

46
00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:51.490
<v Speaker 1>hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we haven't known about this story for</v>

47
00:02:51.491 --> 00:02:52.600
<v Speaker 1>a long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>long time.</v>

48
00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.420
<v Speaker 1>And so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a tremendously exciting discovery</v>

49
00:02:55.421 --> 00:02:57.610
<v Speaker 1>on the part of the people who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who dug it up.</v>

50
00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.510
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to tell you the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

51
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.863
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

52
00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.290
<v Speaker 1>The primary character in this story is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

53
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.680
<v Speaker 1>like a dragon mother named ty mapped and</v>
<v Speaker 1>tire map.</v>

54
00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.660
<v Speaker 1>You can think about her as half the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dragon of chaos and half the destructive</v>

55
00:03:18.661 --> 00:03:20.060
<v Speaker 1>creative feminine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she,</v>

56
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.270
<v Speaker 1>you could think about her as what sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of on the border between what's a known</v>

57
00:03:24.271 --> 00:03:27.930
<v Speaker 1>known in an unknown and unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she is construed as the mother of</v>

58
00:03:27.931 --> 00:03:29.760
<v Speaker 1>all things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

59
00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.250
<v Speaker 1>the mother of all things is like what</v>
<v Speaker 1>was revealed when the towers came down</v>

60
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.550
<v Speaker 1>is this tremendously complex background,</v>
<v Speaker 1>multilevel system of operations that's</v>

61
00:03:44.311 --> 00:03:49.311
<v Speaker 1>always going on that that identifiable</v>
<v Speaker 1>singular things emerged from now.</v>

62
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.960
<v Speaker 1>The mesopotamians wouldn't have said</v>
<v Speaker 1>that because what they said was this</v>

63
00:03:54.961 --> 00:03:57.390
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's the form in which their</v>

64
00:03:57.391 --> 00:04:00.480
<v Speaker 1>knowledge had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It had developed to the point where they</v>

65
00:04:00.481 --> 00:04:04.260
<v Speaker 1>could tell a story about instead of</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe acting it out or dreaming about it</v>

66
00:04:04.261 --> 00:04:05.340
<v Speaker 1>in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

67
00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.080
<v Speaker 1>but they couldn't articulate it.</v>

68
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.320
<v Speaker 1>We can barely articulate it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's time out.</v>

69
00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.820
<v Speaker 1>She's viewed as the mother of all things</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she has a husband named absolute</v>

70
00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:18.480
<v Speaker 1>who's her concert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very little is said about absolut in</v>

71
00:04:18.481 --> 00:04:20.880
<v Speaker 1>this particular story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think the reason for that,</v>

72
00:04:20.881 --> 00:04:25.881
<v Speaker 1>although I'm not sure if this is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Mesopotamian civilization was new</v>

73
00:04:26.131 --> 00:04:29.310
<v Speaker 1>enough as a technological state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

74
00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.100
<v Speaker 1>because they made cities as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>technological state that the myth that</v>

75
00:04:34.101 --> 00:04:39.101
<v Speaker 1>myths of humanity hadn't figured out how</v>
<v Speaker 1>to encapsulate the nature of the,</v>

76
00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.950
<v Speaker 1>of our technological</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy.</v>

77
00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.870
<v Speaker 1>There was a sense that it existed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there wasn't a sense of it as a</v>

78
00:04:48.871 --> 00:04:50.610
<v Speaker 1>carer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>differentiated character that was</v>

79
00:04:50.611 --> 00:04:52.620
<v Speaker 1>capable of doing all sorts of different</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

80
00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.460
<v Speaker 1>I think that didn't emerge until Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I'm not certain about that,</v>

81
00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.870
<v Speaker 1>but that's how it looks to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So absolute is her husband.</v>

82
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.540
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way the Mesopotamian started with</v>

83
00:05:03.541 --> 00:05:05.670
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is the same way that the people</v>

84
00:05:05.671 --> 00:05:07.490
<v Speaker 1>who wrote genesis started the world.</v>

85
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.950
<v Speaker 1>They thought that the world was a desk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what,</v>

86
00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.230
<v Speaker 1>what the world is like when you go</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside and you stand in a field.</v>

87
00:05:13.231 --> 00:05:14.820
<v Speaker 1>It's a flat field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You look at the world,</v>

88
00:05:14.821 --> 00:05:18.240
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty obvious what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a big disk of earth and then</v>

89
00:05:18.241 --> 00:05:21.750
<v Speaker 1>there's a dome on top of it and in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dome or the Sun and the moon and the</v>

90
00:05:21.751 --> 00:05:23.640
<v Speaker 1>stars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you might ask,</v>

91
00:05:23.641 --> 00:05:24.930
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's underneath the earth?</v>

92
00:05:24.931 --> 00:05:29.430
<v Speaker 1>And that the answer for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mesopotamians was fresh water first and</v>

93
00:05:29.431 --> 00:05:31.170
<v Speaker 1>then sold water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how did you know that?</v>

94
00:05:31.171 --> 00:05:32.600
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you drilled down then up,</v>

95
00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.070
<v Speaker 1>the fresh water would come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So obviously it was fresh water down</v>

96
00:05:35.071 --> 00:05:37.530
<v Speaker 1>there and then if you went to the edge</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your territory,</v>

97
00:05:37.531 --> 00:05:39.420
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there's the salt water.</v>

98
00:05:39.421 --> 00:05:41.940
<v Speaker 1>So the earth was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

99
00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:43.420
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

100
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.090
<v Speaker 1>the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

101
00:05:45.091 --> 00:05:49.770
<v Speaker 1>was it disk of matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>resting on a disk of fresh water,</v>

102
00:05:49.771 --> 00:05:54.360
<v Speaker 1>resting on a disk of soap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>water and absolute time that were the</v>

103
00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.630
<v Speaker 1>fresh and salt water respected.</v>

104
00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.920
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now the Mesopotamians thought that</v>

105
00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.960
<v Speaker 1>the way that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that absolutely time that gave birth to</v>

106
00:06:05.961 --> 00:06:09.260
<v Speaker 1>everything was that they joined together</v>
<v Speaker 1>in sexual union.</v>

107
00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.890
<v Speaker 1>It's like the Yin and the Yang and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>very much like that in fact,</v>

108
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.170
<v Speaker 1>and that it was out of their union that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

109
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:21.350
<v Speaker 1>the elemental God's emerged and I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can think of the elemental gods as</v>

110
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:25.940
<v Speaker 1>there are forces of nature and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>viewed through.</v>

111
00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:30.950
<v Speaker 1>They're not personified because to</v>
<v Speaker 1>personify something means that you see</v>

112
00:06:30.951 --> 00:06:35.210
<v Speaker 1>it as an objective phenomena and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>attribute human characteristics to it.</v>

113
00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.600
<v Speaker 1>That isn't how people work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens is we perceive human</v>

114
00:06:38.601 --> 00:06:43.601
<v Speaker 1>characteristics and then only with trip</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible effort do we extract out the</v>

115
00:06:43.881 --> 00:06:48.680
<v Speaker 1>objective reality from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we depersonalize things when we</v>

116
00:06:48.681 --> 00:06:51.590
<v Speaker 1>become scientific,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we just naturally see them as</v>

117
00:06:51.591 --> 00:06:54.890
<v Speaker 1>characters and you can see this when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>read books to kids,</v>

118
00:06:54.891 --> 00:06:57.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like everything's a person that train is</v>

119
00:06:57.891 --> 00:07:02.050
<v Speaker 1>a person in a car as a person that moon</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a person and the sun is a person and,</v>

120
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:05.600
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you read stories to children that have</v>

121
00:07:05.601 --> 00:07:08.150
<v Speaker 1>that as a presupposition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't bother you at all,</v>

122
00:07:08.151 --> 00:07:08.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

123
00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:10.700
<v Speaker 1>you can just fall right into it with no</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>

124
00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in the automations you see the sun</v>

125
00:07:12.861 --> 00:07:15.920
<v Speaker 1>in the sky smiling and bouncing along</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it doesn't bother you,</v>

126
00:07:15.921 --> 00:07:16.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

127
00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:19.130
<v Speaker 1>it's no problem to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to look at the world that way and</v>

128
00:07:19.131 --> 00:07:21.620
<v Speaker 1>there's some utility in looking at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world in that way as,</v>

129
00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:22.610
<v Speaker 1>as we'll discover.</v>

130
00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:25.970
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think part of the reason that we</v>

131
00:07:25.971 --> 00:07:27.230
<v Speaker 1>view things that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

132
00:07:27.231 --> 00:07:30.560
<v Speaker 1>That was the other thing I wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you about our perceptual systems is</v>

133
00:07:30.561 --> 00:07:35.240
<v Speaker 1>that we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do have a social cognitive platform,</v>

134
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:39.080
<v Speaker 1>intellectual platform,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means that our primary categories,</v>

135
00:07:39.081 --> 00:07:42.020
<v Speaker 1>the primary categories of our mind do</v>
<v Speaker 1>seem to be social.</v>

136
00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:46.310
<v Speaker 1>So you could say that the reason our</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind evolved or or.</v>

137
00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:48.230
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could say that the fundamental</v>

138
00:07:48.231 --> 00:07:53.231
<v Speaker 1>selecting pressures on our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on our mind ensured that the,</v>

139
00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:59.810
<v Speaker 1>the primary substructure of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitive ability was modules that could</v>

140
00:08:00.411 --> 00:08:04.430
<v Speaker 1>understand social behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man Can understand,</v>

141
00:08:04.431 --> 00:08:06.290
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women could understand men,</v>

142
00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:08.720
<v Speaker 1>men and women could understand children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>children,</v>

143
00:08:08.721 --> 00:08:10.790
<v Speaker 1>men and women could understand the</v>
<v Speaker 1>social world.</v>

144
00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:12.290
<v Speaker 1>And that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

145
00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:18.430
<v Speaker 1>that's what we're specialized for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it was only after those systems</v>

146
00:08:18.771 --> 00:08:21.290
<v Speaker 1>develop hyper developed probably under</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

147
00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:26.510
<v Speaker 1>under the force of sexual selection that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they became able to separate themselves</v>

148
00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:30.530
<v Speaker 1>to some degree from that underlying</v>
<v Speaker 1>social cognitive structure and start to</v>

149
00:08:30.531 --> 00:08:32.810
<v Speaker 1>see the world in ways that weren't</v>
<v Speaker 1>personified.</v>

150
00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.680
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what that means is that our natural</v>

151
00:08:36.681 --> 00:08:41.270
<v Speaker 1>categories are still an anthropomorphic</v>
<v Speaker 1>and dramatic and it actually turns out</v>

152
00:08:41.271 --> 00:08:44.690
<v Speaker 1>that they work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So absolute timeout,</v>

153
00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:49.700
<v Speaker 1>nature and culture is a perfectly</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable way of thinking about them.</v>

154
00:08:49.701 --> 00:08:50.720
<v Speaker 1>Now they would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

155
00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:55.890
<v Speaker 1>it's the interplay between nature and</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture that gives rise to the</v>

156
00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:00.120
<v Speaker 1>primordial forces of nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now those forces of nature would be to</v>

157
00:09:00.121 --> 00:09:02.820
<v Speaker 1>some degree external like a storm or</v>
<v Speaker 1>like fire.</v>

158
00:09:02.821 --> 00:09:05.830
<v Speaker 1>But they would be so to some degree</v>
<v Speaker 1>internal to like,</v>

159
00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:08.010
<v Speaker 1>like the fire of passion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

160
00:09:08.011 --> 00:09:12.720
<v Speaker 1>And the and the storm of sorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because those are natural forces as</v>

161
00:09:12.721 --> 00:09:16.020
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that the ancients</v>

162
00:09:16.021 --> 00:09:19.170
<v Speaker 1>knew was that man was created to serve</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gods.</v>

163
00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:22.530
<v Speaker 1>And of course modern people think of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that as a superstition,</v>

164
00:09:22.531 --> 00:09:25.500
<v Speaker 1>but that's because they don't really</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand how archaic people thought.</v>

165
00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:26.970
<v Speaker 1>Archaic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People thought.</v>

166
00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:29.730
<v Speaker 1>Like Freud thought it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

167
00:09:29.731 --> 00:09:31.770
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have an ego fine.</v>

168
00:09:31.771 --> 00:09:33.990
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as long as you're in a box within a</v>

169
00:09:33.991 --> 00:09:36.030
<v Speaker 1>bunch of other blocks is the eagle runs</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

170
00:09:36.031 --> 00:09:39.720
<v Speaker 1>But as soon as we put you somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 1>where those boxes are gone,</v>

171
00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:44.580
<v Speaker 1>it's the underlying forces of nature</v>
<v Speaker 1>that run you hunger,</v>

172
00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:45.960
<v Speaker 1>thirst,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

173
00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:49.710
<v Speaker 1>aggression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexuality and all those things that are</v>

174
00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:52.530
<v Speaker 1>impersonal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because of course you have them and you</v>

175
00:09:52.531 --> 00:09:53.820
<v Speaker 1>have them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so does everyone else,</v>

176
00:09:53.821 --> 00:09:57.570
<v Speaker 1>so they're impersonal and transcendent</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're also eternal,</v>

177
00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.840
<v Speaker 1>and so when the art or arcade people</v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

178
00:10:00.841 --> 00:10:05.841
<v Speaker 1>and they usually said this with sorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that man was destined to serve the gods.</v>

179
00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:09.390
<v Speaker 1>That's what they meant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They meant that we were the play.</v>

180
00:10:09.391 --> 00:10:14.391
<v Speaker 1>Things have these unbelievably powerful</v>
<v Speaker 1>primordial forces that manifested</v>

181
00:10:14.551 --> 00:10:18.000
<v Speaker 1>themselves within our lives and</v>
<v Speaker 1>determined our destinies in,</v>

182
00:10:18.001 --> 00:10:18.290
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

183
00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:18.941
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

184
00:10:18.941 --> 00:10:21.840
<v Speaker 1>the Mesopotamian said that specifically</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the elder gods.</v>

185
00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:25.590
<v Speaker 1>They said they were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were part of that which determined</v>

186
00:10:25.591 --> 00:10:28.570
<v Speaker 1>human destiny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They monitor who will talk about in a</v>

187
00:10:28.571 --> 00:10:32.340
<v Speaker 1>while was given the tablet of destinies</v>
<v Speaker 1>because when he was,</v>

188
00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:34.530
<v Speaker 1>when he asked to become top God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

189
00:10:34.531 --> 00:10:35.760
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm going to be taught God,</v>

190
00:10:35.761 --> 00:10:37.960
<v Speaker 1>I get to determine the destinies and</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

191
00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:41.520
<v Speaker 1>we'll get to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you kinda got to know what these,</v>

192
00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:43.410
<v Speaker 1>what these archaic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God's work.</v>

193
00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.640
<v Speaker 1>And they were personalities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

194
00:10:45.641 --> 00:10:46.650
<v Speaker 1>when you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

195
00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:48.121
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

196
00:10:48.121 --> 00:10:52.890
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's a mistake to attribute the</v>
<v Speaker 1>qualities of personality to a storm.</v>

197
00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:57.480
<v Speaker 1>Although it depends on what you think a</v>
<v Speaker 1>storm is,</v>

198
00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:01.710
<v Speaker 1>like a modern person would think of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>storm as an objective event that you</v>

199
00:11:01.711 --> 00:11:05.580
<v Speaker 1>have subjective reactions to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and our keg person would more likely</v>

200
00:11:05.581 --> 00:11:10.200
<v Speaker 1>think of the storm as the subjective</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences of the storm,</v>

201
00:11:10.201 --> 00:11:11.880
<v Speaker 1>plus the storm all at once.</v>

202
00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:16.290
<v Speaker 1>They would make that separation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's a lot easier to personify</v>

203
00:11:16.291 --> 00:11:18.950
<v Speaker 1>something under those conditions or to</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to personify it,</v>

204
00:11:18.951 --> 00:11:22.740
<v Speaker 1>but to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to stay within the realm of</v>

205
00:11:22.741 --> 00:11:24.720
<v Speaker 1>conceptualization that makes it a</v>
<v Speaker 1>persona.</v>

206
00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:28.620
<v Speaker 1>Find Force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the storm God is something that you</v>

207
00:11:28.621 --> 00:11:30.840
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can instill terror into your heart.</v>

208
00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:31.410
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

209
00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:33.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

210
00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:35.810
<v Speaker 1>fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

211
00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.650
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>

212
00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:41.520
<v Speaker 1>absolutely tie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They give rise to these primordial gods</v>

213
00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:47.010
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to think about them as</v>
<v Speaker 1>forces of nature and I think that's a</v>

214
00:11:47.011 --> 00:11:49.890
<v Speaker 1>reasonable representation for a variety</v>
<v Speaker 1>of reasons.</v>

215
00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:51.360
<v Speaker 1>They're like the titans.</v>

216
00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:57.960
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the giving rise to these gods and the</v>

217
00:11:57.961 --> 00:12:02.430
<v Speaker 1>gods are their children and they run</v>
<v Speaker 1>about making all sorts of racket.</v>

218
00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:05.210
<v Speaker 1>They were making rockets and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing this and they're doing that and</v>

219
00:12:05.211 --> 00:12:07.770
<v Speaker 1>they're building things in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>messing about with things in their,</v>

220
00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:11.430
<v Speaker 1>their noisily engaged in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>interactions with one another and</v>

221
00:12:11.431 --> 00:12:14.070
<v Speaker 1>they're having children and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting about sex and they're just</v>

222
00:12:14.071 --> 00:12:19.050
<v Speaker 1>making racket like mad and then they do</v>
<v Speaker 1>something stupid and so they're annoying</v>

223
00:12:19.051 --> 00:12:22.920
<v Speaker 1>time that as they make all this racket,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's sorta slumbering down there in the</v>

224
00:12:22.921 --> 00:12:25.770
<v Speaker 1>depths</v>
<v Speaker 1>leaving them be,</v>

225
00:12:25.771 --> 00:12:28.080
<v Speaker 1>but they make all this racket that may</v>
<v Speaker 1>annoy her.</v>

226
00:12:28.081 --> 00:12:31.050
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's the environmentalist myth</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

227
00:12:31.051 --> 00:12:33.420
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly the same idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

228
00:12:33.421 --> 00:12:34.940
<v Speaker 1>human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're kind of dopey.</v>

229
00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:39.950
<v Speaker 1>We're running around gratifying our</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental needs and making racket and</v>

230
00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:41.760
<v Speaker 1>destroying things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if we're not careful,</v>

231
00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:44.370
<v Speaker 1>mother nature will come flooding back</v>
<v Speaker 1>and wipe us out.</v>

232
00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:45.533
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

233
00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:47.310
<v Speaker 1>that's happened in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could happen,</v>

234
00:12:47.311 --> 00:12:49.560
<v Speaker 1>but it's an archetypal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an archetypal idea.</v>

235
00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:52.820
<v Speaker 1>It's a mythological idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So fine.</v>

236
00:12:52.821 --> 00:12:54.900
<v Speaker 1>They're making racket and timeouts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leaving the beach,</v>

237
00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:57.660
<v Speaker 1>but then they get arrogant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

238
00:12:57.661 --> 00:13:01.440
<v Speaker 1>or careless and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they kill app suit and they make their</v>

239
00:13:01.441 --> 00:13:05.730
<v Speaker 1>dwelling place on his corpse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's a that is a brilliant,</v>

240
00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:08.400
<v Speaker 1>brilliant symbolic idea because what it</v>
<v Speaker 1>means,</v>

241
00:13:08.401 --> 00:13:10.950
<v Speaker 1>it means a bunch of things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things that means is that</v>

242
00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:15.120
<v Speaker 1>in so far as the gods are because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're masculine,</v>

243
00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:18.510
<v Speaker 1>you're part of the representation of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy and the human</v>

244
00:13:18.511 --> 00:13:21.960
<v Speaker 1>interactions within it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the idea that that,</v>

245
00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:27.360
<v Speaker 1>that that's all existing on the corpse</v>
<v Speaker 1>of absolute is something like the idea</v>

246
00:13:27.361 --> 00:13:32.361
<v Speaker 1>that all of the natural forces that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>embodied within human beings and driving</v>

247
00:13:33.421 --> 00:13:38.421
<v Speaker 1>them are resting on a substructure of</v>
<v Speaker 1>dead culture and everyone knows that</v>

248
00:13:41.221 --> 00:13:43.200
<v Speaker 1>because everyone says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially modern people,</v>

249
00:13:43.201 --> 00:13:44.490
<v Speaker 1>they look back at their culture and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

250
00:13:44.491 --> 00:13:45.540
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing's dead.</v>

251
00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:48.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we can rest comfortably on its debt</v>

252
00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:49.471
<v Speaker 1>surface.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

253
00:13:49.471 --> 00:13:51.240
<v Speaker 1>that's not right because if it's dead,</v>

254
00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:53.940
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's dead,</v>

255
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:55.800
<v Speaker 1>logically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not alive,</v>

256
00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:57.540
<v Speaker 1>and if it's not alive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can't adapt.</v>

257
00:13:57.541 --> 00:14:01.530
<v Speaker 1>And if it doesn't adapt and it falls</v>
<v Speaker 1>behind and gets full of errors and it</v>

258
00:14:01.531 --> 00:14:05.220
<v Speaker 1>gets corrupt and starts to fall apart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if it gets corrupted full of errors</v>

259
00:14:05.221 --> 00:14:08.070
<v Speaker 1>and falls apart enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then chaos comes back.</v>

260
00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:10.380
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what happens in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mesopotamian myth.</v>

261
00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:14.250
<v Speaker 1>So they kill app soon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They keep making racket and time at</v>

262
00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:16.140
<v Speaker 1>wakes up one day and she thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

263
00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:19.170
<v Speaker 1>they're noisy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like them that much and now</v>

264
00:14:19.171 --> 00:14:21.870
<v Speaker 1>they've gone and done in my husband,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is order,</v>

265
00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:27.390
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to wait them out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the guards get wind of this and</v>

266
00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.130
<v Speaker 1>they're not very happy about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

267
00:14:29.131 --> 00:14:34.131
<v Speaker 1>because after all they're gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But she is the god goddess slash drag</v>

268
00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:39.560
<v Speaker 1>that gave them all life and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>probability that they'll prevail in a</v>

269
00:14:40.021 --> 00:14:42.810
<v Speaker 1>battle against that which gave them form</v>
<v Speaker 1>is very,</v>

270
00:14:42.811 --> 00:14:43.440
<v Speaker 1>very low.</v>

271
00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:48.440
<v Speaker 1>So they're pretty damn terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So meanwhile time at is generating her</v>

272
00:14:48.961 --> 00:14:52.610
<v Speaker 1>army and she generates quite an army and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Mesopotamians list out what she</v>

273
00:14:52.611 --> 00:14:53.060
<v Speaker 1>does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

274
00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:58.060
<v Speaker 1>she first of all picks for her concert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a new character named king and king who</v>

275
00:14:59.151 --> 00:15:04.151
<v Speaker 1>is like the king of the demons monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So her old husband was app.</v>

276
00:15:05.931 --> 00:15:08.270
<v Speaker 1>So when maybe he was ordered and her new</v>
<v Speaker 1>husband is like,</v>

277
00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:11.360
<v Speaker 1>he's not someone that you want to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>around at all.</v>

278
00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:16.450
<v Speaker 1>And so he's basically put at the hand of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this flanks of terrible monsters and she</v>

279
00:15:16.821 --> 00:15:20.090
<v Speaker 1>generates like Scorpion monsters and</v>
<v Speaker 1>crocodile monsters and all sorts of</v>

280
00:15:20.091 --> 00:15:22.660
<v Speaker 1>things in our army so that she can go</v>
<v Speaker 1>wipe out these,</v>

281
00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:25.970
<v Speaker 1>these gods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so while this is happening,</v>

282
00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:29.690
<v Speaker 1>the gods gathered themselves together</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they decide that they will elect a</v>

283
00:15:29.691 --> 00:15:33.050
<v Speaker 1>champion from within their ranks to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>out and fight with tire map.</v>

284
00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:36.740
<v Speaker 1>And so they do that and they send one</v>
<v Speaker 1>God out and he comes back with his tail</v>

285
00:15:36.741 --> 00:15:38.150
<v Speaker 1>between his legs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>

286
00:15:38.151 --> 00:15:39.010
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't lie,</v>

287
00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:42.050
<v Speaker 1>encounter with chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they send another God out.</v>

288
00:15:42.051 --> 00:15:44.630
<v Speaker 1>The same thing happens and they send</v>
<v Speaker 1>another God out at the same thing</v>

289
00:15:44.631 --> 00:15:46.730
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's getting pretty damn hopeless</v>

290
00:15:46.731 --> 00:15:50.530
<v Speaker 1>because they're sending out their best</v>
<v Speaker 1>men against chaos and the,</v>

291
00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:55.280
<v Speaker 1>and the mother of all things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're getting scoble all the time</v>

292
00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:59.900
<v Speaker 1>while this was happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They continue to produce new generations</v>

293
00:15:59.901 --> 00:16:02.360
<v Speaker 1>of Gods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at one point this new God emerges</v>

294
00:16:02.361 --> 00:16:04.100
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a young person,</v>

295
00:16:04.101 --> 00:16:05.130
<v Speaker 1>I presume.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

296
00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:06.580
<v Speaker 1>but he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

297
00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:09.530
<v Speaker 1>there's some things that are different</v>
<v Speaker 1>than about him than any other thing</v>

298
00:16:09.531 --> 00:16:12.110
<v Speaker 1>that's being produced so far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that's different</v>

299
00:16:12.111 --> 00:16:14.510
<v Speaker 1>is he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's quite tall and powerful,</v>

300
00:16:14.511 --> 00:16:15.290
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

301
00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:18.800
<v Speaker 1>that's not necessarily so radical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he has eyes all the way around his</v>

302
00:16:18.801 --> 00:16:23.440
<v Speaker 1>head and when he speaks he can speak</v>
<v Speaker 1>darkness into being an,</v>

303
00:16:23.441 --> 00:16:24.740
<v Speaker 1>he can speak light into being.</v>

304
00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:27.560
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so things obey the commands of his</v>

305
00:16:27.561 --> 00:16:30.080
<v Speaker 1>words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So He's a master of language.</v>

306
00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:32.360
<v Speaker 1>He can see everywhere and he's a master</v>
<v Speaker 1>of language.</v>

307
00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:34.400
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the garlands and checking them</v>

308
00:16:34.401 --> 00:16:35.131
<v Speaker 1>out and they think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

309
00:16:35.131 --> 00:16:35.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

310
00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:38.820
<v Speaker 1>he's quite something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we can get him to go after time,</v>

311
00:16:38.821 --> 00:16:41.360
<v Speaker 1>Matt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they all go to him in this,</v>

312
00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:42.950
<v Speaker 1>in this little group and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

313
00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:44.600
<v Speaker 1>Marduk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's his name.</v>

314
00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:46.130
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

315
00:16:46.131 --> 00:16:49.670
<v Speaker 1>we've been checking you out and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking pretty impressive.</v>

316
00:16:49.671 --> 00:16:51.340
<v Speaker 1>And so we've got a proposition for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

317
00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:54.740
<v Speaker 1>how about if you go fight time map and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marta,</v>

318
00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:59.770
<v Speaker 1>who's not only all seeing and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and very capable with languages,</v>

319
00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:00.920
<v Speaker 1>no fool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he says,</v>

320
00:17:00.921 --> 00:17:01.461
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

321
00:17:01.461 --> 00:17:02.870
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get what you want,</v>

322
00:17:02.871 --> 00:17:06.650
<v Speaker 1>but here's the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get everybody together first and</v>

323
00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:12.060
<v Speaker 1>I'll go fight your monster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to have a congress and</v>

324
00:17:12.261 --> 00:17:13.040
<v Speaker 1>add that Congress.</v>

325
00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:14.810
<v Speaker 1>You're going to elect me king of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>gods,</v>

326
00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:20.020
<v Speaker 1>and then I'll go fight time map.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so of course the other gods aren't</v>

327
00:17:20.151 --> 00:17:22.670
<v Speaker 1>very happy about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they go off and they have a congress</v>

328
00:17:22.671 --> 00:17:25.820
<v Speaker 1>and they invite mark to it and they talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it and they realize they don't</v>

329
00:17:25.821 --> 00:17:28.160
<v Speaker 1>really have any other choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they decided that they're going to</v>

330
00:17:28.161 --> 00:17:31.280
<v Speaker 1>elect Marduk to the top of the hierarchy</v>
<v Speaker 1>of gods.</v>

331
00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:36.680
<v Speaker 1>Now that's such a smart idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you think,</v>

332
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:39.980
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can think of a hero and then you</v>

333
00:17:39.981 --> 00:17:42.470
<v Speaker 1>could take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you took 10 heroes and average them</v>

334
00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:44.810
<v Speaker 1>out of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a a God,</v>

335
00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:46.970
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it'd be 10 heroes.</v>

336
00:17:46.971 --> 00:17:48.980
<v Speaker 1>You get Annetta here out of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that would be a.</v>

337
00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:54.690
<v Speaker 1>and then maybe you do that to 10 sets of</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 heroes and you get 10 mega heroes.</v>

338
00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:57.870
<v Speaker 1>And then you take all those mega heroes</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you figure out what's the same about</v>

339
00:17:57.871 --> 00:18:02.340
<v Speaker 1>them and you abstract that out and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get the hero of heroes of heroes.</v>

340
00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:04.950
<v Speaker 1>And that's the archetype.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the archetype.</v>

341
00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:09.330
<v Speaker 1>It's a process of distillation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like who is the most interesting</v>

342
00:18:09.331 --> 00:18:12.240
<v Speaker 1>possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most interesting and capable</v>

343
00:18:12.241 --> 00:18:15.330
<v Speaker 1>possible person will that would be this</v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

344
00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:18.150
<v Speaker 1>This is the most memorable possible</v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

345
00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:19.890
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't know who that is,</v>

346
00:18:19.891 --> 00:18:21.600
<v Speaker 1>but this is how we figured out how I</v>
<v Speaker 1>could say,</v>

347
00:18:21.601 --> 00:18:23.130
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I admire something about you and I</v>

348
00:18:23.131 --> 00:18:26.030
<v Speaker 1>admire something about you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can notice that as a phenomenal</v>

349
00:18:26.031 --> 00:18:29.160
<v Speaker 1>logical fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You seem very capable in a certain way</v>

350
00:18:29.161 --> 00:18:31.530
<v Speaker 1>and you know you have this attribute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I might say,</v>

351
00:18:31.531 --> 00:18:36.090
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I was going to sort out an ideal for</v>

352
00:18:36.091 --> 00:18:39.210
<v Speaker 1>myself to follow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I take the good parts of all of</v>

353
00:18:39.211 --> 00:18:39.840
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

354
00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:42.840
<v Speaker 1>And I put that into one thing and then I</v>
<v Speaker 1>would make that my ideal.</v>

355
00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:44.940
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the origin of the idea of the</v>

356
00:18:44.941 --> 00:18:49.941
<v Speaker 1>savior of the Messiah is it's an</v>
<v Speaker 1>emergent idea emerges when people notice</v>

357
00:18:51.421 --> 00:18:56.190
<v Speaker 1>that the hero is that the hero is part</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the forest that makes order out of</v>

358
00:18:56.191 --> 00:18:57.960
<v Speaker 1>chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or sometimes the reverse.</v>

359
00:18:57.961 --> 00:19:02.961
<v Speaker 1>When when order has become too rigid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can also decompose order bringing a</v>

360
00:19:03.061 --> 00:19:05.940
<v Speaker 1>little necessary chaos into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rejuvenate the whole structure.</v>

361
00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:08.760
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so Marta,</v>

362
00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:12.510
<v Speaker 1>he gets elected king.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you might think about how would this</v>

363
00:19:12.511 --> 00:19:15.210
<v Speaker 1>happen historically speaking?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

364
00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:17.100
<v Speaker 1>here's an interesting way of thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

365
00:19:17.101 --> 00:19:20.550
<v Speaker 1>So imagine a landscape that consists of</v>
<v Speaker 1>tribes,</v>

366
00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:23.640
<v Speaker 1>okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then on top of them,</v>

367
00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:27.060
<v Speaker 1>imagine a landscape of the imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

368
00:19:27.061 --> 00:19:32.061
<v Speaker 1>so each member of each tribal group</v>
<v Speaker 1>lives in their imagined world and that</v>

369
00:19:33.631 --> 00:19:37.650
<v Speaker 1>imagined world is full of diabetes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>natural forces of various kinds that</v>

370
00:19:37.651 --> 00:19:38.484
<v Speaker 1>they're following.</v>

371
00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:42.510
<v Speaker 1>But then you can imagine that as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>tribes battle it out and organize</v>

372
00:19:42.511 --> 00:19:45.300
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fingers of the imagination do</v>

373
00:19:45.301 --> 00:19:48.300
<v Speaker 1>exactly the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as the people are battling,</v>

374
00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:52.620
<v Speaker 1>the Gods in heaven are battling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is also a very common mythology,</v>

375
00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:57.770
<v Speaker 1>and as the human beings a beat</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves into a functional group,</v>

376
00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:02.070
<v Speaker 1>their world conceptions do the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

377
00:20:02.071 --> 00:20:04.890
<v Speaker 1>And so over time you move from</v>
<v Speaker 1>polytheism,</v>

378
00:20:04.891 --> 00:20:09.350
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking to monotheism as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

379
00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:12.460
<v Speaker 1>as all of these tribes communicate with</v>
<v Speaker 1>one another in,</v>

380
00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:17.760
<v Speaker 1>in language and in and in combat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sort out just exactly what should be</v>

381
00:20:18.541 --> 00:20:19.650
<v Speaker 1>sovereign,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what should it be?</v>

382
00:20:19.651 --> 00:20:20.670
<v Speaker 1>Powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what should it be?</v>

383
00:20:20.671 --> 00:20:21.481
<v Speaker 1>Dominant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

384
00:20:21.481 --> 00:20:23.970
<v Speaker 1>It's a major.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a major issue and it's partly</v>

385
00:20:23.971 --> 00:20:25.560
<v Speaker 1>practical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's partly conceptual.</v>

386
00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:29.670
<v Speaker 1>So if this is reflected in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mesopotamian creation myth,</v>

387
00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:34.170
<v Speaker 1>the gods assemble themselves and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>look among them and they think,</v>

388
00:20:34.171 --> 00:20:36.960
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well some one here is,</v>

389
00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:42.190
<v Speaker 1>has the characteristics that should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should be the central element of the top</v>

390
00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:45.630
<v Speaker 1>daddy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like the ultimate value.</v>

391
00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:48.490
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the Mesopotamians chose wisely</v>

392
00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:53.770
<v Speaker 1>vision and language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are your most,</v>

393
00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:59.130
<v Speaker 1>the most potent weapons you have against</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos because you,</v>

394
00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:02.560
<v Speaker 1>if you pay attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see chaos when it first emerges.</v>

395
00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:05.380
<v Speaker 1>And then if you are a master of</v>
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>

396
00:21:05.381 --> 00:21:08.170
<v Speaker 1>you can encapsulate it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then articulate it very rapidly,</v>

397
00:21:08.171 --> 00:21:09.910
<v Speaker 1>and you can communicate that to other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people's.</v>

398
00:21:09.911 --> 00:21:13.960
<v Speaker 1>It's like now this easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just cannot overestimate how radical</v>

399
00:21:13.961 --> 00:21:17.860
<v Speaker 1>an idea that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a staggeringly radical idea that</v>

400
00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:20.170
<v Speaker 1>that's the set of attributes that should</v>
<v Speaker 1>be at the top.</v>

401
00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:24.040
<v Speaker 1>The mesopotamians were trying to figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>out what should be sovereign,</v>

402
00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:27.300
<v Speaker 1>what should be above everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

403
00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:28.630
<v Speaker 1>you might say a person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

404
00:21:28.631 --> 00:21:29.350
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

405
00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:32.320
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the person embodies sovereignty.</v>

406
00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:36.010
<v Speaker 1>Sovereignty itself is something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when Frans de Waal,</v>

407
00:21:36.011 --> 00:21:39.130
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was watching chimpanzees hash it out</v>

408
00:21:39.131 --> 00:21:40.720
<v Speaker 1>for dominance in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

409
00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:41.630
<v Speaker 1>in the zoo.</v>

410
00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:44.620
<v Speaker 1>I think it's in the R and M,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

411
00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:46.960
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a zoo that has a lot of chimpanzees</v>

412
00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:48.520
<v Speaker 1>and he spent a lot of time watching</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

413
00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:53.260
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one idea about the dominant chimp is</v>

414
00:21:53.261 --> 00:21:58.261
<v Speaker 1>that he's just the biggest meanness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like most tyrannical chimp.</v>

415
00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:01.480
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of the strong man theory of</v>
<v Speaker 1>chimp leadership.</v>

416
00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:05.410
<v Speaker 1>But what do all observed was that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that was sort of true in that the</v>

417
00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:09.130
<v Speaker 1>strongest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meanest chimpanzee could obtain</v>

418
00:22:09.131 --> 00:22:11.590
<v Speaker 1>dominance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem with him is if he was</v>

419
00:22:11.591 --> 00:22:15.730
<v Speaker 1>really like selfish and cruel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that he didn't have any friends.</v>

420
00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:18.910
<v Speaker 1>Now chimps have friends and they spent a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of time with them and they groom</v>

421
00:22:18.911 --> 00:22:21.220
<v Speaker 1>each other and they protect each other</v>
<v Speaker 1>and fights and like,</v>

422
00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:23.920
<v Speaker 1>you can be the ugliest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meanest chimp around.</v>

423
00:22:23.921 --> 00:22:27.640
<v Speaker 1>But if there's two chimps that are three</v>
<v Speaker 1>quarters your strength coming at you,</v>

424
00:22:27.641 --> 00:22:30.250
<v Speaker 1>it's like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you lose now.</v>

425
00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:33.970
<v Speaker 1>So that means two chimps that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>capable of enough civilization to find</v>

426
00:22:33.971 --> 00:22:38.971
<v Speaker 1>themselves in to a dyad that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has mutual obligations across time,</v>

427
00:22:40.541 --> 00:22:43.180
<v Speaker 1>is way stronger than one ship who</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't.</v>

428
00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:46.930
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is that strength</v>
<v Speaker 1>and viciousness,</v>

429
00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:49.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there'll be times when that can emerge</v>

430
00:22:49.631 --> 00:22:51.220
<v Speaker 1>as the dominant power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's very,</v>

431
00:22:51.221 --> 00:22:52.300
<v Speaker 1>very unstable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

432
00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:55.420
<v Speaker 1>and everyone's motivated to bring it</v>
<v Speaker 1>down as fast as possible.</v>

433
00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:57.760
<v Speaker 1>And the best way to bring it down is</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the coalition.</v>

434
00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:01.450
<v Speaker 1>And so partly what that indicates is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's actually the chimp who's the</v>

435
00:23:01.451 --> 00:23:04.750
<v Speaker 1>best at making coalitions that's most</v>
<v Speaker 1>likely to become sovereign.</v>

436
00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:06.670
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's actually what happens with</v>

437
00:23:06.671 --> 00:23:08.460
<v Speaker 1>the chimps is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

438
00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:13.850
<v Speaker 1>the dictator chimp is very unstable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in the one story I read it of Arnhem</v>

439
00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:15.880
<v Speaker 1>Zoo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he rose to the top,</v>

440
00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:16.740
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

441
00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:17.573
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

442
00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:18.700
<v Speaker 1>bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad guy,</v>

443
00:23:18.701 --> 00:23:23.410
<v Speaker 1>the gangster guy and a two chimps went</v>
<v Speaker 1>after him and to pieces.</v>

444
00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:26.800
<v Speaker 1>They tore off his testicles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

445
00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:29.140
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it agitated the hell out of the rest of</v>

446
00:23:29.141 --> 00:23:31.540
<v Speaker 1>the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was like a bloody revolution,</v>

447
00:23:31.541 --> 00:23:32.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was really,</v>

448
00:23:32.471 --> 00:23:34.570
<v Speaker 1>really stressful for the troop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

449
00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:38.020
<v Speaker 1>but what it indicates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's so interesting,</v>

450
00:23:38.021 --> 00:23:42.130
<v Speaker 1>is that the idea that in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a dominance hierarchy,</v>

451
00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:47.340
<v Speaker 1>what's most dominant is power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That there's no evidence whatsoever that</v>

452
00:23:48.111 --> 00:23:49.130
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>

453
00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:53.930
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to when I have a partner</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a business that I have,</v>

454
00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:56.150
<v Speaker 1>who was a student of mine at Harvard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a very,</v>

455
00:23:56.151 --> 00:24:00.530
<v Speaker 1>very smart person and I was talking to</v>
<v Speaker 1>him about dominance hierarchies and he</v>

456
00:24:00.531 --> 00:24:04.430
<v Speaker 1>said something very that I found very</v>
<v Speaker 1>upsetting on a variety of levels.</v>

457
00:24:04.431 --> 00:24:08.120
<v Speaker 1>He said it's not a dominance hierarchy</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can't put a dog collar on the</v>

458
00:24:08.121 --> 00:24:12.020
<v Speaker 1>person one level below you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty bloody blunt statement,</v>

459
00:24:12.021 --> 00:24:14.150
<v Speaker 1>but when he's he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's prone to that sort of thing,</v>

460
00:24:14.151 --> 00:24:19.151
<v Speaker 1>but what he meant is that it's possible</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the idea that the term dominance</v>

461
00:24:19.371 --> 00:24:23.030
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy is not the right term to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>applying to these sorts of social</v>

462
00:24:23.031 --> 00:24:27.320
<v Speaker 1>structures because what it implies is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that what keeps the structure in place</v>

463
00:24:27.321 --> 00:24:28.280
<v Speaker 1>is power.</v>

464
00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:30.320
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the sort of claim that people</v>

465
00:24:30.321 --> 00:24:31.270
<v Speaker 1>like food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coal make.</v>

466
00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:33.770
<v Speaker 1>It's all about power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the thing is,</v>

467
00:24:33.771 --> 00:24:37.100
<v Speaker 1>it's not all about power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not all about power.</v>

468
00:24:37.101 --> 00:24:41.300
<v Speaker 1>It's not all about power among animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So with power,</v>

469
00:24:41.301 --> 00:24:43.460
<v Speaker 1>with chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's all you've got is power,</v>

470
00:24:43.461 --> 00:24:45.260
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get wiped out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to.</v>

471
00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:49.760
<v Speaker 1>So what I found was that the chimps who</v>
<v Speaker 1>were able to establish stable patterns</v>

472
00:24:49.761 --> 00:24:54.180
<v Speaker 1>of leadership were quite congenial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had a lot of allies,</v>

473
00:24:54.181 --> 00:24:57.980
<v Speaker 1>so they engaged in mutual grooming and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of social interaction and they were</v>

474
00:24:57.981 --> 00:25:01.490
<v Speaker 1>very positively predisposed to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>females in the truth.</v>

475
00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:03.780
<v Speaker 1>So that's pretty interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

476
00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:07.790
<v Speaker 1>because we don't know what constitutes</v>
<v Speaker 1>valid sovereignty,</v>

477
00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:11.300
<v Speaker 1>but even in animals it doesn't seem to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be power.</v>

478
00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:13.810
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you know,</v>

479
00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:16.220
<v Speaker 1>you look at wolf packs and that sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and you know,</v>

480
00:25:16.221 --> 00:25:18.710
<v Speaker 1>if two wolves go at it for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for dominance,</v>

481
00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:23.300
<v Speaker 1>one wolf of back off and roll over and</v>
<v Speaker 1>show his throat and you know,</v>

482
00:25:23.301 --> 00:25:26.810
<v Speaker 1>like Stalin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wolf would just tear out his throat.</v>

483
00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:32.620
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Churchill Wolf let say would say,</v>

484
00:25:33.081 --> 00:25:34.310
<v Speaker 1>well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're kind of useless,</v>

485
00:25:34.311 --> 00:25:36.980
<v Speaker 1>but we might need you around later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why don't you get up and you know,</v>

486
00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:39.620
<v Speaker 1>we'll let bygones be bygones and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>what wolves do,</v>

487
00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:41.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and unsurprisingly,</v>

488
00:25:41.571 --> 00:25:44.150
<v Speaker 1>because what are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kill everyone in your troop?</v>

489
00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:48.290
<v Speaker 1>Well that doesn't seem like a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>effective strategy either for meeting or</v>

490
00:25:48.291 --> 00:25:51.260
<v Speaker 1>for survival.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the Mesopotamians were trying to work</v>

491
00:25:51.261 --> 00:25:54.890
<v Speaker 1>out practically who's going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>sovereign and at the same time</v>

492
00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:58.490
<v Speaker 1>conceptually what is the proper basis</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sovereignty,</v>

493
00:25:58.491 --> 00:26:01.520
<v Speaker 1>which is really the ultimate question in</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense.</v>

494
00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:05.020
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they elect Marduk and the markets go</v>

495
00:26:05.021 --> 00:26:07.790
<v Speaker 1>to all these eyes and he can speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he thinks,</v>

496
00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:10.580
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>

497
00:26:10.581 --> 00:26:12.110
<v Speaker 1>if I win,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get the tablet,</v>

498
00:26:12.111 --> 00:26:14.600
<v Speaker 1>have destinies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I'm taught God.</v>

499
00:26:14.601 --> 00:26:15.201
<v Speaker 1>And they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

500
00:26:15.201 --> 00:26:16.100
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

501
00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:17.780
<v Speaker 1>if you win,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no problem.</v>

502
00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:22.810
<v Speaker 1>So he goes out to fight time and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>takes a sword and he and he takes a net</v>

503
00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:28.580
<v Speaker 1>and they meet on the battlefield and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>encapsulates timeout in a net,</v>

504
00:26:28.581 --> 00:26:31.250
<v Speaker 1>which I think is a brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant metaphor again,</v>

505
00:26:31.251 --> 00:26:35.240
<v Speaker 1>because chaos is a morphous and</v>
<v Speaker 1>unformed,</v>

506
00:26:35.241 --> 00:26:37.040
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you want to conquer it,</v>

507
00:26:37.041 --> 00:26:40.240
<v Speaker 1>you have to encapsulate it within a net,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a net.</v>

508
00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:42.440
<v Speaker 1>You have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to make it into something</v>

509
00:26:42.441 --> 00:26:44.510
<v Speaker 1>rather than something amorphous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

510
00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:45.930
<v Speaker 1>when.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So look,</v>

511
00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:49.350
<v Speaker 1>maybe a client comes to me and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

512
00:26:49.351 --> 00:26:52.300
<v Speaker 1>I've been having these terrible symptoms</v>
<v Speaker 1>on my heart races and I,</v>

513
00:26:52.301 --> 00:26:53.020
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

514
00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:55.140
<v Speaker 1>my breath,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't catch my breath and I think I'm</v>

515
00:26:55.141 --> 00:26:57.020
<v Speaker 1>going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

516
00:26:57.180 --> 00:27:00.000
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe I'm having a heart attack</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm always at the hospital and they</v>

517
00:27:00.001 --> 00:27:01.700
<v Speaker 1>tell me that there's nothing wrong with</v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

518
00:27:01.930 --> 00:27:03.060
<v Speaker 1>but I have like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

519
00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:05.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid all the time and I'm starting</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to go out.</v>

520
00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:06.870
<v Speaker 1>And I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

521
00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:08.490
<v Speaker 1>you have agoraphobic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

522
00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:14.720
<v Speaker 1>lots of people have that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not the only person like that in</v>

523
00:27:14.721 --> 00:27:16.790
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only that it has a name,</v>

524
00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:20.630
<v Speaker 1>we know what to do about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a treatment course and</v>

525
00:27:20.631 --> 00:27:24.710
<v Speaker 1>they'd go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that the</v>

526
00:27:24.711 --> 00:27:28.250
<v Speaker 1>unknown unknown has just been turned</v>
<v Speaker 1>into a known unknown and that's a</v>

527
00:27:28.251 --> 00:27:33.251
<v Speaker 1>massive improvement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the person who conceptualizes the</v>

528
00:27:33.381 --> 00:27:36.620
<v Speaker 1>anomalous situations fastest is in fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>the leader.</v>

529
00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:39.860
<v Speaker 1>That's the definition of leadership.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like we don't know what's going on.</v>

530
00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:42.980
<v Speaker 1>This is what's going on and what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you say,</v>

531
00:27:42.981 --> 00:27:47.030
<v Speaker 1>this is what's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you also simultaneously say,</v>

532
00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:50.930
<v Speaker 1>here's a million other things that could</v>
<v Speaker 1>have been going on that aren't.</v>

533
00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:55.310
<v Speaker 1>So it's a process of radical</v>
<v Speaker 1>simplification and it lowers the stress</v>

534
00:27:55.311 --> 00:27:56.590
<v Speaker 1>levels immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

535
00:27:56.591 --> 00:28:01.280
<v Speaker 1>so time that goes in or articles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he gets her in a nap and then he splits</v>

536
00:28:01.281 --> 00:28:04.370
<v Speaker 1>in half and he makes heaven out of one</v>
<v Speaker 1>half and the earth out of the other for</v>

537
00:28:04.371 --> 00:28:09.371
<v Speaker 1>the human beings and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he goes back to any defeats,</v>

538
00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:13.130
<v Speaker 1>Keto and all the monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he goes back to tell the other</v>

539
00:28:13.131 --> 00:28:14.540
<v Speaker 1>gods and they're pretty happy about</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

540
00:28:14.541 --> 00:28:16.580
<v Speaker 1>And he knew had the tablet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the destinies,</v>

541
00:28:16.581 --> 00:28:19.370
<v Speaker 1>but Martin took that from him and now he</v>
<v Speaker 1>has it.</v>

542
00:28:19.371 --> 00:28:23.360
<v Speaker 1>So he gets to determine destiny and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes human beings out of king whose</v>

543
00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:26.150
<v Speaker 1>blood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is quite an interesting little</v>

544
00:28:26.151 --> 00:28:29.330
<v Speaker 1>twist to the story and he makes them to</v>
<v Speaker 1>serve the gods.</v>

545
00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:31.790
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's that.</v>

546
00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:32.683
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

547
00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:36.880
<v Speaker 1>so the idea is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hero who can see and can communicate</v>

548
00:28:36.881 --> 00:28:41.320
<v Speaker 1>is also the hero who separates out the</v>
<v Speaker 1>elements of existence so that it becomes</v>

549
00:28:41.321 --> 00:28:45.370
<v Speaker 1>a habitable place and that humans should</v>
<v Speaker 1>serve that serve.</v>

550
00:28:45.371 --> 00:28:46.420
<v Speaker 1>Margo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

551
00:28:46.421 --> 00:28:48.410
<v Speaker 1>you have to serve something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

552
00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:52.390
<v Speaker 1>you're going to serve a natural force of</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of you gonna be all anger.</v>

553
00:28:52.391 --> 00:28:54.280
<v Speaker 1>You can be all last,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are going to be all love,</v>

554
00:28:54.281 --> 00:28:57.490
<v Speaker 1>we can be all hunger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or are you going to represent some</v>

555
00:28:57.491 --> 00:28:59.290
<v Speaker 1>integrated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

556
00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:01.510
<v Speaker 1>some some balanced and integrated</v>

557
00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:07.650
<v Speaker 1>emergent property of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also socially constructed and also</v>

558
00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:11.970
<v Speaker 1>that you're a balance of natural forces</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're a civilized person.</v>

559
00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:15.320
<v Speaker 1>That's some sort of essence and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're going to strive for.</v>

560
00:29:15.321 --> 00:29:16.180
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's Marta,</v>

561
00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:18.260
<v Speaker 1>so you're supposed to be a good murder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

562
00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:21.530
<v Speaker 1>Margaret is immortal now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only person who was identified with</v>

563
00:29:21.531 --> 00:29:23.870
<v Speaker 1>Martech in the Mesopotamian realm was</v>
<v Speaker 1>the emperor.</v>

564
00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:27.980
<v Speaker 1>Now they lived in a walled city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so what the emperor,</v>

565
00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:30.950
<v Speaker 1>the reason the emperor was sovereign was</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he was supposed to be the</v>

566
00:29:30.951 --> 00:29:34.130
<v Speaker 1>embodiment of Marico and earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which meant that his job was to</v>

567
00:29:34.131 --> 00:29:37.310
<v Speaker 1>transform chaos into order whenever</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos threatened.</v>

568
00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:39.710
<v Speaker 1>He was supposed to transform it back</v>
<v Speaker 1>into order.</v>

569
00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:44.230
<v Speaker 1>So this is what Mesopotamians did at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Year's celebration when the year is</v>

570
00:29:44.231 --> 00:29:45.280
<v Speaker 1>rejuvenated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

571
00:29:45.281 --> 00:29:47.800
<v Speaker 1>The old year dies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course we know that because we still</v>

572
00:29:47.801 --> 00:29:49.960
<v Speaker 1>do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the new year is this new baby.</v>

573
00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:53.290
<v Speaker 1>It's a time of new beginnings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the Mesopotamians would take the</v>

574
00:29:53.291 --> 00:29:57.520
<v Speaker 1>emperor out of the city and they'd strip</v>
<v Speaker 1>him of all his emperor close,</v>

575
00:29:57.940 --> 00:30:02.800
<v Speaker 1>and then they'd make them recite all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways during the last year that he'd been</v>

576
00:30:02.801 --> 00:30:05.080
<v Speaker 1>a bad Marduk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he hadn't kept,</v>

577
00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:08.920
<v Speaker 1>he hadn't been encountering chaos</v>
<v Speaker 1>properly and hadn't been keeping order</v>

578
00:30:08.921 --> 00:30:12.760
<v Speaker 1>property,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so and confess all of his inadequacies.</v>

579
00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:16.480
<v Speaker 1>Then the priest would whack them with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>glove as a,</v>

580
00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:19.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a ritual punishment,</v>

581
00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:23.860
<v Speaker 1>and then they take all the statues out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the old gods out of the city,</v>

582
00:30:23.861 --> 00:30:28.861
<v Speaker 1>and then they really represent the</v>
<v Speaker 1>battle between Martech and tire mount,</v>

583
00:30:30.490 --> 00:30:35.490
<v Speaker 1>and then the emperor was mark and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>would win and then he would have sex</v>

584
00:30:35.801 --> 00:30:39.440
<v Speaker 1>with a ritual prostitute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was that.</v>

585
00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:43.600
<v Speaker 1>This is a much tougher concept,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a way of symbolizing the fact</v>

586
00:30:43.601 --> 00:30:48.280
<v Speaker 1>that if the creative force encounters</v>
<v Speaker 1>the positive element of the feminine,</v>

587
00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:50.650
<v Speaker 1>it's like the prince and sleeping</v>
<v Speaker 1>beauty,</v>

588
00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:54.130
<v Speaker 1>getting sleeping beauty from the grasp</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the evil queen who turns into the</v>

589
00:30:54.131 --> 00:30:54.720
<v Speaker 1>Dragon.</v>

590
00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:56.020
<v Speaker 1>It's exact because it's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

591
00:30:56.021 --> 00:30:58.330
<v Speaker 1>You've seen that and you understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

592
00:30:58.510 --> 00:31:00.010
<v Speaker 1>Sleeping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beauty's all in the tower.</v>

593
00:31:00.011 --> 00:31:04.330
<v Speaker 1>She's covered by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's hemmed in by a huge fields of</v>

594
00:31:04.331 --> 00:31:06.760
<v Speaker 1>thorns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Evil Queen is trying to stop the</v>

595
00:31:06.761 --> 00:31:09.640
<v Speaker 1>prints from getting to her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She turns into a dragon which makes</v>

596
00:31:09.641 --> 00:31:12.760
<v Speaker 1>absolutely no sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but everyone follows it and then he has</v>

597
00:31:12.761 --> 00:31:14.340
<v Speaker 1>to fight his way through that to get to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

598
00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:17.290
<v Speaker 1>to the main.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same idea in a different</v>

599
00:31:17.291 --> 00:31:21.760
<v Speaker 1>context and then order productive order</v>
<v Speaker 1>being reestablished.</v>

600
00:31:21.761 --> 00:31:25.330
<v Speaker 1>Everybody goes back into the kingdom and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's renewed for the next year and</v>

601
00:31:25.331 --> 00:31:29.320
<v Speaker 1>that's the idea behind Mesopotamian</v>
<v Speaker 1>sovereignty and it's bloody brilliant</v>

602
00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:31.020
<v Speaker 1>because it's an abs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

603
00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:31.710
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

604
00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:33.700
<v Speaker 1>it's the beginnings of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of law.</v>

605
00:31:33.701 --> 00:31:34.690
<v Speaker 1>In some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

606
00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:38.710
<v Speaker 1>it's the idea that to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be proper,</v>

607
00:31:38.711 --> 00:31:41.080
<v Speaker 1>even if you're a desperate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you're the king,</v>

608
00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:46.410
<v Speaker 1>there's a sacred pattern of behavior</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you must adhere to,</v>

609
00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:52.680
<v Speaker 1>which is the consequence of a congress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the gods deciding what the most</v>

610
00:31:52.751 --> 00:31:54.130
<v Speaker 1>effective mode of being is.</v>

611
00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:58.960
<v Speaker 1>It's staggeringly brilliant and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it took that story.</v>

612
00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:01.020
<v Speaker 1>We just have no idea how long that story</v>
<v Speaker 1>took.</v>

613
00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:02.470
<v Speaker 1>Do we merge?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's,</v>

614
00:32:02.610 --> 00:32:05.890
<v Speaker 1>it's the consequence of the full course</v>
<v Speaker 1>of human evolutionary history.</v>

615
00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:09.550
<v Speaker 1>Like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are elements in it that are as old</v>

616
00:32:09.551 --> 00:32:12.500
<v Speaker 1>as mammals and maybe older than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

617
00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:17.170
<v Speaker 1>if you think about those patterns being</v>
<v Speaker 1>embedded in behavior long before they</v>

618
00:32:17.171 --> 00:32:19.720
<v Speaker 1>were abstracted out into</v>
<v Speaker 1>representations,</v>

619
00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:24.520
<v Speaker 1>it's unbelievably archaic and ancient</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you have time at the great</v>

620
00:32:24.521 --> 00:32:27.430
<v Speaker 1>mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have absolutely the great father,</v>

621
00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:32.080
<v Speaker 1>you have Marduk the archetypal son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have king who's the negative element</v>

622
00:32:32.081 --> 00:32:33.340
<v Speaker 1>of Marta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

623
00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:38.740
<v Speaker 1>And you have the drama of all those</v>
<v Speaker 1>characters interacting across time and</v>

624
00:32:38.741 --> 00:32:41.510
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the mythological,</v>

625
00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:46.010
<v Speaker 1>mythological representation of reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And tying that to tie it into the</v>

626
00:32:46.011 --> 00:32:47.840
<v Speaker 1>neuropsychology that we talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

627
00:32:47.841 --> 00:32:50.090
<v Speaker 1>we talked about anomaly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

628
00:32:50.390 --> 00:32:52.570
<v Speaker 1>And how normally you have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

629
00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:56.510
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a box that you're in that is your world,</v>

630
00:32:57.170 --> 00:32:59.270
<v Speaker 1>but that box doesn't contain everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world.</v>

631
00:32:59.271 --> 00:33:02.000
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of things that are good at</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes they poked their head in</v>

632
00:33:02.001 --> 00:33:05.510
<v Speaker 1>like a snake and then that's disruptive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what do you do?</v>

633
00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:06.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to,</v>

634
00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:11.930
<v Speaker 1>you have to voluntarily encounter the</v>
<v Speaker 1>snake then either defeated or make</v>

635
00:33:11.931 --> 00:33:13.750
<v Speaker 1>something valuable out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

636
00:33:13.751 --> 00:33:16.430
<v Speaker 1>you could cower and hide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all that generally means the state</v>

637
00:33:16.431 --> 00:33:20.510
<v Speaker 1>grows and grows until there's hardly any</v>
<v Speaker 1>you in the box and there's all snake and</v>

638
00:33:20.511 --> 00:33:22.320
<v Speaker 1>that's actually the Mesopotamian</v>
<v Speaker 1>stories.</v>

639
00:33:22.321 --> 00:33:26.960
<v Speaker 1>It's like if the elder gods weren't so</v>
<v Speaker 1>careless and had been paying attention</v>

640
00:33:27.290 --> 00:33:29.960
<v Speaker 1>and hadn't killed absolute time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would've stayed asleep the whole</v>

641
00:33:29.961 --> 00:33:31.440
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

642
00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:34.940
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the,</v>

643
00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:40.060
<v Speaker 1>that's the level of isomorphism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's,</v>

644
00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:43.840
<v Speaker 1>what's fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think inevitable is that the</v>

645
00:33:43.870 --> 00:33:48.440
<v Speaker 1>mythology reflects the physiology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how could it not?</v>

646
00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:51.440
<v Speaker 1>The physiology produced the mythology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

647
00:33:51.441 --> 00:33:54.170
<v Speaker 1>of course that's going to be the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It shouldn't be a surprise.</v>

648
00:33:54.171 --> 00:33:55.820
<v Speaker 1>It should be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it should be,</v>

649
00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:58.430
<v Speaker 1>it should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reverse should be a surprise.</v>

650
00:33:58.431 --> 00:34:00.200
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's no relationship</v>
<v Speaker 1>between these,</v>

651
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:02.600
<v Speaker 1>these old stories and the way that human</v>
<v Speaker 1>beings are structured.</v>

652
00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:03.620
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

653
00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:04.970
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

654
00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:07.820
<v Speaker 1>that's a dumb idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

655
00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:15.973
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

656
00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:18.030
<v Speaker 1>that's the Mesopotamian creation myths</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

657
00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:19.410
<v Speaker 1>it's a killer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

658
00:34:19.411 --> 00:34:21.700
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a staggering story.</v>

659
00:34:22.210 --> 00:34:23.740
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it still sits.</v>

660
00:34:23.741 --> 00:34:27.640
<v Speaker 1>Whether we know it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sits at the very base of our culture.</v>

661
00:34:27.730 --> 00:34:31.300
<v Speaker 1>It's absolute that story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if we kill it,</v>

662
00:34:32.050 --> 00:34:35.920
<v Speaker 1>which we will or have been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then then look out,</v>

663
00:34:37.090 --> 00:34:40.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know the story from so long ago,</v>

664
00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:44.500
<v Speaker 1>if you let your culture die and act</v>
<v Speaker 1>carelessly towards it,</v>

665
00:34:44.590 --> 00:34:47.890
<v Speaker 1>all hell will break loose and it's no</v>
<v Speaker 1>joke.</v>

666
00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:52.910
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so here we are trying to revive a fight.</v>

667
00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:00.580
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty weird that these things</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened to be real.</v>

668
00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:03.580
<v Speaker 1>But then if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

669
00:35:03.581 --> 00:35:05.620
<v Speaker 1>how could it be otherwise?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

670
00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:08.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think all these people who lived</v>

671
00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:13.950
<v Speaker 1>before us for the tens of millions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>years that we've had are vaguely human.</v>

672
00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:20.220
<v Speaker 1>Pre predessessors were stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They weren't and they weren't ignorant</v>

673
00:35:23.471 --> 00:35:25.660
<v Speaker 1>and they weren't superstitious or any of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things.</v>

674
00:35:25.661 --> 00:35:28.330
<v Speaker 1>They were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>

675
00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:30.400
<v Speaker 1>they were tough enough so that we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
