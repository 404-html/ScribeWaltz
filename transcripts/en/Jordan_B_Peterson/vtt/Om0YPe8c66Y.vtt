1
00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:06.590
<v Speaker 1>The first thing I already explained to</v>
<v Speaker 1>you that about the shift in our emphasis</v>

2
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.760
<v Speaker 1>from here on in</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I suppose in some ways where we're</v>

3
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.780
<v Speaker 1>switching from the part of the purse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course it has to do with</v>

4
00:00:15.781 --> 00:00:20.781
<v Speaker 1>transformation into the part of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>course that has to do with stability,</v>

5
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.980
<v Speaker 1>at least relative stability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the idea behind the work that we're</v>

6
00:00:25.981 --> 00:00:30.981
<v Speaker 1>going to talk about now is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality has stable and identifiable</v>

7
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.770
<v Speaker 1>features across time and I suppose it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>traits that you're referring to when you</v>

8
00:00:38.431 --> 00:00:42.540
<v Speaker 1>say to yourself or to someone else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that person</v>

9
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.320
<v Speaker 1>and when you say that you know that</v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

10
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.580
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that you're presuming</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's something stable and</v>

11
00:00:50.581 --> 00:00:54.000
<v Speaker 1>identifiable about them that you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>track over time.</v>

12
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.570
<v Speaker 1>You might consider that who they are</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so trait theory</v>

13
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.910
<v Speaker 1>is the study</v>
<v Speaker 1>of who people are.</v>

14
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.090
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's 17,000 trait descriptors in</v>

15
00:01:12.091 --> 00:01:17.091
<v Speaker 1>the English language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that suggests in some way that there are</v>

16
00:01:17.251 --> 00:01:22.050
<v Speaker 1>17,000 ways that people can vary or be</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same.</v>

17
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.740
<v Speaker 1>No vary from each other and be the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>across time.</v>

18
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.340
<v Speaker 1>But 17,000 seems like not an</v>
<v Speaker 1>unmanageable number and it's possible</v>

19
00:01:32.821 --> 00:01:33.654
<v Speaker 1>that</v>

20
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.740
<v Speaker 1>a very large number of those words are</v>
<v Speaker 1>variance there,</v>

21
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.760
<v Speaker 1>synonyms in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and trait theory in some ways is an</v>

22
00:01:47.011 --> 00:01:52.011
<v Speaker 1>attempt to find</v>
<v Speaker 1>the clumps of synonymous words that are</v>

23
00:01:52.171 --> 00:01:55.890
<v Speaker 1>encapsulated within language that apply</v>
<v Speaker 1>to people.</v>

24
00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.360
<v Speaker 1>The basic hypothesis is something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>this</v>

25
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.130
<v Speaker 1>because tracking the behavior of other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people is extremely important to us and</v>

26
00:02:08.821 --> 00:02:13.140
<v Speaker 1>because we want to communicate about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that tracking and because we're studying</v>

27
00:02:13.141 --> 00:02:16.380
<v Speaker 1>each other all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's at least a reasonable</v>

28
00:02:16.381 --> 00:02:21.381
<v Speaker 1>probability that the fundamental</v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensions of personality are going to</v>

29
00:02:22.171 --> 00:02:27.171
<v Speaker 1>be encapsulated within the language and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what that means in some senses that you</v>

30
00:02:27.361 --> 00:02:30.750
<v Speaker 1>may be able to use the language as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>tool if you use the appropriate</v>

31
00:02:30.751 --> 00:02:35.751
<v Speaker 1>statistical techniques in order to</v>
<v Speaker 1>extract out the fundamental dimensions</v>

32
00:02:35.881 --> 00:02:39.270
<v Speaker 1>of personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you could say those are the</v>

33
00:02:39.271 --> 00:02:43.260
<v Speaker 1>basic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine there's five or six canonical</v>

34
00:02:43.261 --> 00:02:48.261
<v Speaker 1>words or 10 canonical words within that</v>
<v Speaker 1>collection of 17,000 and then all the</v>

35
00:02:50.341 --> 00:02:55.341
<v Speaker 1>others are slight variance of the more</v>
<v Speaker 1>mixtures of them more or something like</v>

36
00:02:56.671 --> 00:02:58.770
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So perhaps there's a simple structure</v>

37
00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.780
<v Speaker 1>underneath the apparent complexity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first people who tried this,</v>

38
00:03:05.021 --> 00:03:09.160
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all part allport and Odbert,</v>

39
00:03:09.161 --> 00:03:11.740
<v Speaker 1>but they really didn't have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>statistical techniques that were</v>

40
00:03:11.741 --> 00:03:15.270
<v Speaker 1>necessary to do a particularly good job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

41
00:03:15.271 --> 00:03:16.104
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

42
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:34.050
<v Speaker 1>all port Nordberg tried to reduce their</v>
<v Speaker 1>18,000 treat terms to 4,500 descriptors</v>

43
00:03:35.741 --> 00:03:37.810
<v Speaker 1>of what they figured we're stable</v>
<v Speaker 1>traits.</v>

44
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.040
<v Speaker 1>And then cattle came along in 1942</v>
<v Speaker 1>restricted those two,</v>

45
00:03:42.041 --> 00:03:46.180
<v Speaker 1>171 by judgment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then further to 16 by factor</v>

46
00:03:46.181 --> 00:03:49.810
<v Speaker 1>analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are cattell 16 traits.</v>

47
00:03:49.811 --> 00:03:54.811
<v Speaker 1>The first three were the most important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could be reserved versus outgoing,</v>

48
00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.990
<v Speaker 1>less or more intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional versus stable,</v>

49
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.270
<v Speaker 1>humble versus assertive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sober versus happy,</v>

50
00:04:07.271 --> 00:04:09.910
<v Speaker 1>go lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Expedient versus conscientious,</v>

51
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.410
<v Speaker 1>shy versus fincher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some tough tender minded,</v>

52
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.540
<v Speaker 1>trusting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suspicious,</v>

53
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.580
<v Speaker 1>practical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imaginative,</v>

54
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.290
<v Speaker 1>forthright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shrewd,</v>

55
00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.120
<v Speaker 1>placid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apprehensive,</v>

56
00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.490
<v Speaker 1>conservative or experimental,</v>
<v Speaker 1>group oriented yourself,</v>

57
00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.590
<v Speaker 1>sufficient casual versus controlled and</v>
<v Speaker 1>relaxed versus tense.</v>

58
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:38.130
<v Speaker 1>And cattell 16 personality theory</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominated the field for,</v>

59
00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.390
<v Speaker 1>for quite a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

60
00:04:40.391 --> 00:04:45.391
<v Speaker 1>until the early 19 sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

61
00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.210
<v Speaker 1>now we'll go back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you a little bit about how these</v>

62
00:04:53.211 --> 00:04:56.000
<v Speaker 1>things are measured.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's some,</v>

63
00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.570
<v Speaker 1>here's some definitions of what a trait</v>
<v Speaker 1>might be.</v>

64
00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.010
<v Speaker 1>This is the theoretical theories or</v>
<v Speaker 1>theoretical propositions.</v>

65
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.910
<v Speaker 1>The trade has more than a normal</v>
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>

66
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:09.980
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

67
00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.270
<v Speaker 1>it refers to something that's outside</v>
<v Speaker 1>its linguistic marker,</v>

68
00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.940
<v Speaker 1>so hypothetically there's something</v>
<v Speaker 1>about a trait that that makes it real.</v>

69
00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.420
<v Speaker 1>That might be physiological or</v>
<v Speaker 1>biological or at least behavioral that</v>

70
00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:28.850
<v Speaker 1>that that can be examined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The outside mirror subjective analysis,</v>

71
00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:33.050
<v Speaker 1>although that's often proved more</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult than people originally</v>

72
00:05:33.051 --> 00:05:36.560
<v Speaker 1>expected traits are more generalized in</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular habits.</v>

73
00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.200
<v Speaker 1>Oh God only knows how many habits people</v>
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

74
00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:40.970
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you kind of maybe you run into the</v>

75
00:05:40.971 --> 00:05:44.900
<v Speaker 1>same problem with habits as you do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>with 17,000 words.</v>

76
00:05:44.901 --> 00:05:48.740
<v Speaker 1>There's so many of them that you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can drown in the description and</v>

77
00:05:48.741 --> 00:05:50.180
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to look for something that's</v>

78
00:05:50.181 --> 00:05:53.870
<v Speaker 1>more fundamental.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're dynamic and determined behavior,</v>

79
00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:59.870
<v Speaker 1>so there's something about a trait that</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense acts as a causal agent,</v>

80
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:03.590
<v Speaker 1>traits me be identified empirically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We covered that.</v>

81
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.380
<v Speaker 1>Traits are relatively independent of</v>
<v Speaker 1>other traits.</v>

82
00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.630
<v Speaker 1>They're not synonymous with moral or</v>
<v Speaker 1>social judgements and acts and even</v>

83
00:06:11.631 --> 00:06:16.631
<v Speaker 1>habits that are inconsistent with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>trait or not proof of the nonexistence</v>

84
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.290
<v Speaker 1>of that trait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the more complex one trades me</v>

85
00:06:21.291 --> 00:06:24.530
<v Speaker 1>either be viewed video graphically in</v>
<v Speaker 1>light of the personality that contains</v>

86
00:06:24.531 --> 00:06:29.030
<v Speaker 1>them or nomothetically on the basis of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their distribution in the population</v>

87
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
<v Speaker 1>measurement techniques.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine that you collect your list of</v>

88
00:06:46.541 --> 00:06:48.400
<v Speaker 1>adjectives and then</v>

89
00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:54.810
<v Speaker 1>you transform them into a very simple</v>
<v Speaker 1>questionnaire.</v>

90
00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:58.750
<v Speaker 1>And so the questionnaire would look like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a list of adjectives down the lefthand</v>

91
00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:00.570
<v Speaker 1>side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then on the righthand side there'd</v>

92
00:07:00.571 --> 00:07:04.470
<v Speaker 1>be maybe a scale that's yes or no or</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a scale from one to seven.</v>

93
00:07:04.471 --> 00:07:07.830
<v Speaker 1>And so if the descriptor was</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent,</v>

94
00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:12.900
<v Speaker 1>you could ask the person apply that</v>
<v Speaker 1>descriptor to yourself on a scale from</v>

95
00:07:12.901 --> 00:07:15.720
<v Speaker 1>one to seven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or You could ask the person to rate</v>

96
00:07:15.721 --> 00:07:20.721
<v Speaker 1>someone else and describe that person as</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent on a scale of one to seven.</v>

97
00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:27.260
<v Speaker 1>And then you can have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say a large group of adjectives</v>

98
00:07:27.721 --> 00:07:30.690
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three hundred or so.</v>

99
00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:35.900
<v Speaker 1>And then you can have a large number of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people assess themselves with all those</v>

100
00:07:35.971 --> 00:07:40.890
<v Speaker 1>adjectives and you can apply statistical</v>
<v Speaker 1>techniques that then allow you to</v>

101
00:07:40.891 --> 00:07:45.870
<v Speaker 1>determine how the data is pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

102
00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:51.090
<v Speaker 1>if two of the 400 words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're intelligent and smart,</v>

103
00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:56.040
<v Speaker 1>and you might find that within the</v>
<v Speaker 1>entire population of raiders,</v>

104
00:07:56.070 --> 00:08:00.300
<v Speaker 1>if they are rating themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they rated themselves as high on</v>

105
00:08:00.301 --> 00:08:02.880
<v Speaker 1>intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're also going to rate themselves as</v>

106
00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:08.060
<v Speaker 1>high on smart and maybe high on quick</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe high on insightful.</v>

107
00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:13.920
<v Speaker 1>And then you may also find,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

108
00:08:13.921 --> 00:08:17.460
<v Speaker 1>that if they rated themselves as nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>highly,</v>

109
00:08:17.461 --> 00:08:22.461
<v Speaker 1>they might also rate themselves as kind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>highly or empathic highly.</v>

110
00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:27.890
<v Speaker 1>And so by analyzing the groups of words</v>
<v Speaker 1>that clumped together in the same</v>

111
00:08:28.591 --> 00:08:31.230
<v Speaker 1>direction across many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many people,</v>

112
00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:34.770
<v Speaker 1>you can start to in and you can do this</v>
<v Speaker 1>statistically,</v>

113
00:08:34.771 --> 00:08:38.550
<v Speaker 1>you can start to infer what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental dimensions of variation are.</v>

114
00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:43.410
<v Speaker 1>Now it's taken a long time for people to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get the fundamental dimensions of</v>

115
00:08:43.411 --> 00:08:46.050
<v Speaker 1>variation right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of the problem is,</v>

116
00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:49.230
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you reduce the pool of adjectives</v>

117
00:08:49.231 --> 00:08:51.870
<v Speaker 1>to begin with to something that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're not going to have,</v>

118
00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a thousand people rate themselves on 17</v>

119
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:57.240
<v Speaker 1>adjectives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just not going to go very well,</v>

120
00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:01.830
<v Speaker 1>so you have to reduce that in some way</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not exactly biased and then you</v>

121
00:09:01.831 --> 00:09:05.040
<v Speaker 1>have to get enough people to fill it out</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that your sample is going to be</v>

122
00:09:05.041 --> 00:09:06.270
<v Speaker 1>reliable across time.</v>

123
00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:10.350
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to have statistical</v>
<v Speaker 1>techniques that are powerful enough to</v>

124
00:09:10.351 --> 00:09:13.620
<v Speaker 1>handle those operations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that already didn't come together</v>

125
00:09:13.621 --> 00:09:17.500
<v Speaker 1>until probably the early 19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>60,</v>

126
00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:18.590
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>

127
00:09:18.591 --> 00:09:22.470
<v Speaker 1>when when cartels 16 factors were</v>
<v Speaker 1>finally reduced to something</v>

128
00:09:22.471 --> 00:09:26.790
<v Speaker 1>approximating five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm going to tell you a little bit</v>

129
00:09:26.791 --> 00:09:30.510
<v Speaker 1>how you would go about making a</v>
<v Speaker 1>questionnaire because that's part of</v>

130
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:34.890
<v Speaker 1>what you need to know in order to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>experimental psychology,</v>

131
00:09:34.891 --> 00:09:37.230
<v Speaker 1>especially social and personality</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology.</v>

132
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:41.210
<v Speaker 1>And so we'll step into method a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit before we returned to the,</v>

133
00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:45.600
<v Speaker 1>to the trait theories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you want it to measure something,</v>

134
00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:54.740
<v Speaker 1>let's see someone think of a potential</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality trait.</v>

135
00:09:54.741 --> 00:09:58.340
<v Speaker 1>Don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't use the standard big five how.</v>

136
00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:01.940
<v Speaker 1>Give me a word that you might use to</v>
<v Speaker 1>describe someone</v>

137
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:08.030
<v Speaker 1>fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

138
00:10:08.031 --> 00:10:09.290
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now,</v>

139
00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:12.890
<v Speaker 1>now we have to figure out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now we've got a problem and the</v>

140
00:10:12.891 --> 00:10:14.800
<v Speaker 1>problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

141
00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:17.840
<v Speaker 1>you can use fun as a marker in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>linguistic exchange.</v>

142
00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:24.240
<v Speaker 1>Joe is a fun person to hang around with</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then</v>

143
00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:31.650
<v Speaker 1>part of the meaning that you attribute</v>
<v Speaker 1>to fund is a consequence of the words</v>

144
00:10:31.651 --> 00:10:35.140
<v Speaker 1>that you surrounded with and then of</v>
<v Speaker 1>course the context in which you uttered</v>

145
00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:39.060
<v Speaker 1>the sentence and your determination of</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not the person you're talking</v>

146
00:10:39.061 --> 00:10:44.061
<v Speaker 1>to knows who joe is and and so you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>always providing the person that you're</v>

147
00:10:44.731 --> 00:10:47.160
<v Speaker 1>communicating with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you use a word like fun with a</v>

148
00:10:47.161 --> 00:10:49.890
<v Speaker 1>bunch of information that sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>surrounds the word so that they can</v>

149
00:10:49.891 --> 00:10:52.920
<v Speaker 1>infer what you meet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you're going to</v>

150
00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:59.420
<v Speaker 1>use that word and infer that it actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>ref refers to something that's objective</v>

151
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.260
<v Speaker 1>outside language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have to go about it in a</v>

152
00:11:04.261 --> 00:11:06.450
<v Speaker 1>different way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the first thing you try to do is</v>

153
00:11:06.451 --> 00:11:08.010
<v Speaker 1>to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

154
00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:11.430
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean by fun?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

155
00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:16.830
<v Speaker 1>So let's have some characteristics of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>person who's fun.</v>

156
00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:19.923
<v Speaker 2>What do they like?</v>

157
00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:24.870
<v Speaker 1>We can't use big five descriptors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

158
00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:25.860
<v Speaker 1>that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>

159
00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:26.960
<v Speaker 1>that's right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

160
00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:30.740
<v Speaker 1>But</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to stay away from that just just</v>

161
00:11:30.741 --> 00:11:31.574
<v Speaker 1>for</v>

162
00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:34.590
<v Speaker 1>funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

163
00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:36.030
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a funny,</v>

164
00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:39.570
<v Speaker 1>a fun person is funny and so a funny</v>
<v Speaker 1>person is someone who makes you laugh,</v>

165
00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.340
<v Speaker 1>I presume.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And who's witty?</v>

166
00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:44.610
<v Speaker 1>And so you could start generating</v>
<v Speaker 1>associated words.</v>

167
00:11:44.611 --> 00:11:46.350
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What else makes a person fun?</v>

168
00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:49.800
<v Speaker 1>They're interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

169
00:11:49.801 --> 00:11:52.230
<v Speaker 1>So they're funny and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

170
00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.730
<v Speaker 1>What else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Friendly.</v>

171
00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:57.970
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Enthusiastic,</v>

172
00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:01.140
<v Speaker 1>talkative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lighthearted,</v>

173
00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:03.490
<v Speaker 1>lighthearted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

174
00:12:03.491 --> 00:12:05.230
<v Speaker 1>you guys are really getting into this</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

175
00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:10.300
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're starting to surround the word</v>

176
00:12:10.301 --> 00:12:14.230
<v Speaker 1>with a cloud of additional words that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you believe in.</v>

177
00:12:14.231 --> 00:12:16.720
<v Speaker 1>Some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some ways have some important</v>

178
00:12:16.721 --> 00:12:18.820
<v Speaker 1>similarity with that underlying work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

179
00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:20.950
<v Speaker 1>They seem to belong in the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>category.</v>

180
00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:22.490
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are some words that,</v>

181
00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:27.460
<v Speaker 1>that indicate that someone's not fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

182
00:12:27.461 --> 00:12:29.080
<v Speaker 1>So they're boring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>miserable,</v>

183
00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:31.960
<v Speaker 1>miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the difference between boring and</v>

184
00:12:31.961 --> 00:12:36.961
<v Speaker 1>miserable?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good one.</v>

185
00:12:37.981 --> 00:12:39.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Misery can be interesting.</v>

186
00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:41.153
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

187
00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:42.330
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

188
00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:45.150
<v Speaker 1>So are other differences between boring</v>
<v Speaker 1>and miserable?</v>

189
00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:49.770
<v Speaker 1>That's probably an open answer by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

190
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:52.860
<v Speaker 1>Just just so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any other differences?</v>

191
00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:54.690
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys know the difference between</v>

192
00:12:54.691 --> 00:12:57.030
<v Speaker 1>boring and miserable for God's sake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

193
00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:00.783
<v Speaker 3>Boring.</v>

194
00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:05.120
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So boring sounds like it's more neutral</v>

195
00:13:05.121 --> 00:13:07.190
<v Speaker 1>in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Miserable.</v>

196
00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:10.160
<v Speaker 1>Was that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that a positive thing or negative</v>

197
00:13:10.161 --> 00:13:11.330
<v Speaker 1>thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Negative.</v>

198
00:13:11.331 --> 00:13:11.901
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

199
00:13:11.901 --> 00:13:16.010
<v Speaker 1>and what sort of emotions might it be</v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with depression?</v>

200
00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:17.300
<v Speaker 1>Sadness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depression.</v>

201
00:13:17.301 --> 00:13:20.540
<v Speaker 1>What else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anxiety.</v>

202
00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:22.970
<v Speaker 1>Hate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hate.</v>

203
00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:26.600
<v Speaker 1>Fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cynicism.</v>

204
00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:27.913
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

205
00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:34.430
<v Speaker 1>now we've got the fun person sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>identified with regards to a positive</v>

206
00:13:34.431 --> 00:13:36.020
<v Speaker 1>pole at a negative pole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

207
00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:37.363
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

208
00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:43.220
<v Speaker 1>you can conduct a brief statistical</v>
<v Speaker 1>investigation to determine whether or</v>

209
00:13:43.221 --> 00:13:48.200
<v Speaker 1>not your characterization of fun had any</v>
<v Speaker 1>utility was,</v>

210
00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:51.500
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was valid in some sense and reliable and</v>

211
00:13:51.501 --> 00:13:54.710
<v Speaker 1>valid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing we might do is write</v>

212
00:13:54.711 --> 00:13:58.040
<v Speaker 1>down all those words on a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a little questionnaire.</v>

213
00:13:58.041 --> 00:14:00.110
<v Speaker 1>So we probably generated about 20 of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

214
00:14:00.111 --> 00:14:05.111
<v Speaker 1>me and then we might ask everyone to</v>
<v Speaker 1>rate themselves according to that</v>

215
00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:08.580
<v Speaker 1>questionnaire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we,</v>

216
00:14:08.581 --> 00:14:13.581
<v Speaker 1>we might submit the</v>
<v Speaker 1>data set to factor analysis,</v>

217
00:14:13.911 --> 00:14:16.310
<v Speaker 1>which is a complicated form of</v>
<v Speaker 1>correlation analysis,</v>

218
00:14:16.311 --> 00:14:19.550
<v Speaker 1>and then we could find out what words</v>
<v Speaker 1>clump together.</v>

219
00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:24.440
<v Speaker 1>Now what we would find if we analyzed</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the words that you guys generated is</v>

220
00:14:24.441 --> 00:14:29.441
<v Speaker 1>that we'd have one little clump that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with interesting and we'd</v>

221
00:14:30.711 --> 00:14:33.890
<v Speaker 1>have another clump that was associated</v>
<v Speaker 1>with negative emotion and we'd have</v>

222
00:14:33.891 --> 00:14:36.290
<v Speaker 1>another clump that was associated with</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive emotion.</v>

223
00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:41.650
<v Speaker 1>And so you guys actually define fun as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>three dimensional construct from given</v>

224
00:14:42.321 --> 00:14:45.110
<v Speaker 1>what we know about personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we know that there's a positive</v>

225
00:14:45.111 --> 00:14:47.330
<v Speaker 1>emotion dimension at a negative emotion</v>
<v Speaker 1>dimension.</v>

226
00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:52.600
<v Speaker 1>And then another dimension that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with creativity and so from,</v>

227
00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:56.180
<v Speaker 1>for at least in so far as you all</v>
<v Speaker 1>characterized it,</v>

228
00:14:56.181 --> 00:14:58.370
<v Speaker 1>fund is not a unidimensional word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

229
00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:00.620
<v Speaker 1>it crosses a variety of different</v>
<v Speaker 1>domains now.</v>

230
00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:05.090
<v Speaker 1>So if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're trying to get at how to</v>

231
00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:07.490
<v Speaker 1>measure fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing you have to do is define</v>

232
00:15:07.491 --> 00:15:08.720
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what we're trying to do.</v>

233
00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:10.250
<v Speaker 1>When we were collecting up all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>words.</v>

234
00:15:10.251 --> 00:15:15.251
<v Speaker 1>I'll show you how cattle in 1965</v>
<v Speaker 1>characterized conscientiousness.</v>

235
00:15:15.711 --> 00:15:16.251
<v Speaker 1>So he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

236
00:15:16.251 --> 00:15:21.170
<v Speaker 1>this thing exists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in its existence it manifests these</v>

237
00:15:21.171 --> 00:15:24.230
<v Speaker 1>characteristics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conscientious is conscientiousness is</v>

238
00:15:24.231 --> 00:15:25.550
<v Speaker 1>that disposition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>governing,</v>

239
00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:27.770
<v Speaker 1>persevering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unselfish behavior,</v>

240
00:15:27.771 --> 00:15:31.640
<v Speaker 1>and impelling the individual to duty as</v>
<v Speaker 1>conceived by his or her culture.</v>

241
00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:37.130
<v Speaker 1>A conscientious person is honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knows what is right and generally does</v>

242
00:15:37.131 --> 00:15:41.750
<v Speaker 1>it even if no one is watching him or her</v>
<v Speaker 1>does not tell lies or attempt to deceive</v>

243
00:15:41.751 --> 00:15:44.900
<v Speaker 1>others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>respects other's property and</v>

244
00:15:44.901 --> 00:15:47.570
<v Speaker 1>unconscientious person is somewhat</v>
<v Speaker 1>unscrupulous,</v>

245
00:15:47.571 --> 00:15:49.610
<v Speaker 1>not too careful about standards of right</v>
<v Speaker 1>and wrong,</v>

246
00:15:49.611 --> 00:15:53.240
<v Speaker 1>were personal desires are concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tells lies and is given a little</v>

247
00:15:53.241 --> 00:15:56.150
<v Speaker 1>receipts and does not respect others'</v>
<v Speaker 1>property.</v>

248
00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:00.620
<v Speaker 1>So you can imagine how you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>transform that definition into a</v>

249
00:16:00.621 --> 00:16:02.780
<v Speaker 1>questionnaire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could use the adjectives that are in</v>

250
00:16:02.781 --> 00:16:05.180
<v Speaker 1>it and just have people rate themselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the adjectives.</v>

251
00:16:05.181 --> 00:16:07.970
<v Speaker 1>Or you could use little phrase phrases</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

252
00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:13.010
<v Speaker 1>do you respect others?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Property one to seven,</v>

253
00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:18.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have a strong sense of the</v>

254
00:16:18.551 --> 00:16:21.190
<v Speaker 1>difference between right and wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you know what's right,</v>

255
00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:25.810
<v Speaker 1>do you generally do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you a persistent person?</v>

256
00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:27.640
<v Speaker 1>Are you unselfish?</v>

257
00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:34.140
<v Speaker 1>So you can extract out individual items</v>
<v Speaker 1>from your sort of global definition of</v>

258
00:16:34.141 --> 00:16:39.141
<v Speaker 1>what constitutes the hypothetical trait</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's some of the examples.</v>

259
00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:44.670
<v Speaker 1>You usually keep emotions under control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you a person who is scrupulously</v>

260
00:16:44.671 --> 00:16:47.520
<v Speaker 1>correct and manners and social</v>
<v Speaker 1>obligations and likes others to be the</v>

261
00:16:47.521 --> 00:16:50.520
<v Speaker 1>same?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you cautious and considerate so that</v>

262
00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:54.720
<v Speaker 1>you do not hurt people's feelings by</v>
<v Speaker 1>unconsidered conversational remarks?</v>

263
00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:58.650
<v Speaker 1>I liked the adjective approach in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways because you might notice that the</v>

264
00:16:58.651 --> 00:17:03.300
<v Speaker 1>last question there plumps a number of</v>
<v Speaker 1>descriptors together and it isn't</v>

265
00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:07.500
<v Speaker 1>absolutely certain that all those</v>
<v Speaker 1>descriptors belong in the same question.</v>

266
00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:11.460
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say this is was</v>
<v Speaker 1>constructed quite a long time ago and I</v>

267
00:17:11.461 --> 00:17:14.220
<v Speaker 1>would say if you're going to construct</v>
<v Speaker 1>questions you should try to answer,</v>

268
00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:18.030
<v Speaker 1>you try to ask as close to one thing as</v>
<v Speaker 1>possible because otherwise the question</v>

269
00:17:18.031 --> 00:17:21.470
<v Speaker 1>gets confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would say the,</v>

270
00:17:21.471 --> 00:17:23.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the second question also has the same</v>

271
00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:27.890
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>

272
00:17:27.891 --> 00:17:31.670
<v Speaker 1>So if you're going to make your</v>
<v Speaker 1>questionnaire and let's say you're,</v>

273
00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:35.170
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to figure out how fun</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone is</v>

274
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:39.820
<v Speaker 1>and simultaneously figure out whether or</v>
<v Speaker 1>not investigating fund is actually a</v>

275
00:17:39.821 --> 00:17:41.100
<v Speaker 1>reasonable thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd like,</v>

276
00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:45.100
<v Speaker 1>is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it a scientifically valid category?</v>

277
00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:51.390
<v Speaker 1>Then you might want to generate whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of items and also put some in</v>

278
00:17:51.391 --> 00:17:56.391
<v Speaker 1>there that don't obviously measure fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's have some descriptors that</v>

279
00:17:56.941 --> 00:17:59.970
<v Speaker 1>don't seem to fall on the fun non-funded</v>
<v Speaker 1>dimension.</v>

280
00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:06.870
<v Speaker 1>What's outside of that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

281
00:18:09.631 --> 00:18:10.464
<v Speaker 1>Which one?</v>

282
00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:12.203
<v Speaker 2>I would say.</v>

283
00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.490
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And defined.</v>

284
00:18:14.491 --> 00:18:15.324
<v Speaker 1>STOIC.</v>

285
00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:22.930
<v Speaker 2>Careful with your words not having an</v>
<v Speaker 2>excess of emotional.</v>

286
00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:25.211
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

287
00:18:25.211 --> 00:18:28.370
<v Speaker 1>So you think you could you think you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>be fun to not have an excess of</v>

288
00:18:28.371 --> 00:18:31.520
<v Speaker 1>emotional response and I'm not trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>put you on the spot,</v>

289
00:18:31.521 --> 00:18:34.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just wondering if that's what you're</v>

290
00:18:34.071 --> 00:18:34.904
<v Speaker 1>claiming</v>

291
00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:43.680
<v Speaker 2>because just because you're a situation.</v>

292
00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.033
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

293
00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:52.133
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

294
00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:54.240
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

295
00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:55.440
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what other,</v>

296
00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:57.480
<v Speaker 1>what other descriptors?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

297
00:18:57.481 --> 00:19:00.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean fun can't mean everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

298
00:19:00.001 --> 00:19:03.480
<v Speaker 1>Because if it means and everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's not a useful word because the</v>

299
00:19:03.481 --> 00:19:06.240
<v Speaker 1>word has to be some things and not other</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

300
00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:10.440
<v Speaker 1>That's</v>
<v Speaker 1>convergent.</v>

301
00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:14.730
<v Speaker 1>Divergent validity in a sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A word can't mean everything.</v>

302
00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:16.890
<v Speaker 1>It has to be something specific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what does,</v>

303
00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:19.280
<v Speaker 1>what's outside of the fund?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Non funded me.</v>

304
00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:23.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can be fun and stupid fact,</v>

305
00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:26.900
<v Speaker 1>fact that might even be easier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

306
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.770
<v Speaker 1>So intelligence might be outside of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

307
00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:34.040
<v Speaker 1>What else might be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you could be envious and fund still</v>

308
00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:39.180
<v Speaker 1>seems least probable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about me?</v>

309
00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:43.030
<v Speaker 1>Can you be mean and fun?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

310
00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:45.060
<v Speaker 1>So that's kind of interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

311
00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:48.360
<v Speaker 1>so</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

312
00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:50.340
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now we're starting to get the idea</v>

313
00:19:50.341 --> 00:19:54.330
<v Speaker 1>that fun circumscribes one dimension,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are other potential dimensions</v>

314
00:19:54.331 --> 00:19:57.190
<v Speaker 1>variation outside of that that might be</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting to look at.</v>

315
00:19:57.210 --> 00:20:00.430
<v Speaker 1>And so we've sort of thought about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we thought sort of thought about.</v>

316
00:20:00.431 --> 00:20:01.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

317
00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:04.350
<v Speaker 1>we thought about intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What else did we come up with?</v>

318
00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:08.490
<v Speaker 1>What else is sort of outside of the fun</v>
<v Speaker 1>realm?</v>

319
00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:11.153
<v Speaker 1>Patient.</v>

320
00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:12.670
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

321
00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:16.750
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can be impatient fund or patient</v>

322
00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:18.320
<v Speaker 1>fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

323
00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:19.900
<v Speaker 1>Seems reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fashionable.</v>

324
00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:21.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

325
00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:23.470
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think that's a person who said</v>

326
00:20:23.471 --> 00:20:26.200
<v Speaker 1>that you think that's a personality</v>
<v Speaker 1>trait?</v>

327
00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:32.280
<v Speaker 2>I think it means that you pay</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

328
00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:39.771
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

329
00:20:39.771 --> 00:20:40.580
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you,</v>

330
00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:42.990
<v Speaker 1>you definitely do think it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality characteristic and that</v>

331
00:20:42.991 --> 00:20:44.270
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could well be,</v>

332
00:20:44.271 --> 00:20:45.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

333
00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:48.940
<v Speaker 1>is there a difference between a</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality characteristic and an</v>

334
00:20:48.941 --> 00:20:49.774
<v Speaker 1>emotion</v>

335
00:20:56.650 --> 00:20:58.630
<v Speaker 1>you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think emotion is inside</v>

336
00:20:58.631 --> 00:21:00.640
<v Speaker 1>personality?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's nested inside it.</v>

337
00:21:00.641 --> 00:21:04.000
<v Speaker 1>The personality is the larger category</v>
<v Speaker 1>of emotion is the smaller category.</v>

338
00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:05.253
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

339
00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:07.270
<v Speaker 1>it's a funny thing because there's lots</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

340
00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:12.220
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of a priority suppositions</v>
<v Speaker 1>in psychology that you have to watch out</v>

341
00:21:12.221 --> 00:21:14.650
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of them is that just because</v>

342
00:21:14.651 --> 00:21:17.320
<v Speaker 1>there's different words for different</v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

343
00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:21.970
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean those different things</v>
<v Speaker 1>really exists separately as separate</v>

344
00:21:21.971 --> 00:21:25.360
<v Speaker 1>things do in scientific terminology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

345
00:21:25.361 --> 00:21:29.230
<v Speaker 1>the relationship between personality</v>
<v Speaker 1>traits and emotions and values is</v>

346
00:21:29.231 --> 00:21:32.410
<v Speaker 1>relatively unclear whether those things</v>
<v Speaker 1>belong in the same or different</v>

347
00:21:32.411 --> 00:21:35.830
<v Speaker 1>categories is by no means clear and</v>
<v Speaker 1>people will claim that they do.</v>

348
00:21:35.831 --> 00:21:39.100
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the overlap is substantial,</v>

349
00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:40.360
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

350
00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.033
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

351
00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:47.530
<v Speaker 2>We also usually think of emotions as</v>
<v Speaker 2>being more like we're all,</v>

352
00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:52.640
<v Speaker 2>we all experienced sadness itself</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't mean that that's a fundamental</v>

353
00:21:52.981 --> 00:21:56.680
<v Speaker 2>trait of our personality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we're all able to experience it</v>

354
00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:00.600
<v Speaker 2>usually defined who we are unless we're</v>

355
00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:02.220
<v Speaker 1>right and so and so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

356
00:22:02.221 --> 00:22:05.790
<v Speaker 1>And so that's part of the definition of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a trait as something that's enduring</v>

357
00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:07.680
<v Speaker 1>rather than transient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

358
00:22:07.681 --> 00:22:10.500
<v Speaker 1>So you could say that's actually a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis.</v>

359
00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:15.530
<v Speaker 1>Your hypothesis is that what we refer to</v>
<v Speaker 1>as emotions are brief flare ups of some</v>

360
00:22:17.521 --> 00:22:19.770
<v Speaker 1>of the phenomena that we would consider</v>
<v Speaker 1>traits if,</v>

361
00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:21.630
<v Speaker 1>if they were enduring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

362
00:22:21.631 --> 00:22:23.610
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's a reasonable hypothesis.</v>

363
00:22:23.611 --> 00:22:26.910
<v Speaker 1>Although if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you describe a person as sad,</v>

364
00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:30.300
<v Speaker 1>do you think you're describing their</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality or their emotion?</v>

365
00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:34.400
<v Speaker 2>It could be either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would normally think,</v>

366
00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:36.271
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

367
00:22:36.271 --> 00:22:37.104
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

368
00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:38.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's a tricky.</v>

369
00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:39.630
<v Speaker 1>It's tricky business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

370
00:22:39.631 --> 00:22:43.920
<v Speaker 1>So the reason I had you generate all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these additional words just because you</v>

371
00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:48.990
<v Speaker 1>need to find out that your category fun</v>
<v Speaker 1>has a bunch of things that it doesn't</v>

372
00:22:49.291 --> 00:22:51.360
<v Speaker 1>cover as well as a bunch of things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does.</v>

373
00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:55.860
<v Speaker 1>And so we've hypothesized a number of</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that might constitute additional</v>

374
00:22:55.861 --> 00:22:58.200
<v Speaker 1>domains of variation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you might want to throw those</v>

375
00:22:58.201 --> 00:22:59.220
<v Speaker 1>into your questionnaire too.</v>

376
00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:05.250
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now</v>

377
00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:07.681
<v Speaker 1>he might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

378
00:23:07.681 --> 00:23:09.060
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to do with your</v>
<v Speaker 1>scale?</v>

379
00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:13.530
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>you now you have a scale and you can</v>

380
00:23:13.531 --> 00:23:17.640
<v Speaker 1>give it to people and you can tell the</v>
<v Speaker 1>difference between the fund people in</v>

381
00:23:17.641 --> 00:23:20.520
<v Speaker 1>the not fun people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what might be some practical</v>

382
00:23:20.521 --> 00:23:25.170
<v Speaker 1>purposes towards which you could put</v>
<v Speaker 1>that knowledge.</v>

383
00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:31.070
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to be too serious about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

384
00:23:31.071 --> 00:23:32.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to.</v>

385
00:23:32.081 --> 00:23:36.680
<v Speaker 1>You could invite all the non-funded</v>
<v Speaker 1>people to a party that would seem rather</v>

386
00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:40.340
<v Speaker 1>counterproductive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're your hypothesis would be that</v>

387
00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:43.640
<v Speaker 1>maybe you'd have two parties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd have a party with all the fun</v>

388
00:23:43.641 --> 00:23:46.760
<v Speaker 1>people and you'd have another party with</v>
<v Speaker 1>all non fund people and then you could</v>

389
00:23:46.761 --> 00:23:50.810
<v Speaker 1>get the attendees to rate how fun the</v>
<v Speaker 1>party was.</v>

390
00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:54.260
<v Speaker 1>And then that would help you determine</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not your measurement of fund</v>

391
00:23:54.261 --> 00:23:57.980
<v Speaker 1>was actually practically useful for</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's called criterion</v>

392
00:23:57.981 --> 00:23:59.450
<v Speaker 1>related validity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

393
00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:04.510
<v Speaker 1>So and criterion related validity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If a scale possesses criteria and</v>

394
00:24:04.511 --> 00:24:07.190
<v Speaker 1>related to the liquidity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can identify something that might</v>

395
00:24:07.191 --> 00:24:12.191
<v Speaker 1>predict that doesn't like completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously associated with the initial</v>

396
00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:14.360
<v Speaker 1>measure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although you know,</v>

397
00:24:14.361 --> 00:24:17.930
<v Speaker 1>fun and fun and a party probably are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a bad example,</v>

398
00:24:17.931 --> 00:24:21.650
<v Speaker 1>but you can use it to predict something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that might be a value.</v>

399
00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:25.190
<v Speaker 1>So I can give you an example of that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that conscientiousness for which is a</v>

400
00:24:25.191 --> 00:24:30.191
<v Speaker 1>trade from his is frequently used to</v>
<v Speaker 1>evaluate how good an employee might be</v>

401
00:24:31.071 --> 00:24:33.740
<v Speaker 1>if you hired them or even how good a</v>
<v Speaker 1>student might be because</v>

402
00:24:33.741 --> 00:24:38.210
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness turns out to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty good predictor of academic</v>

403
00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:40.520
<v Speaker 1>achievement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

404
00:24:40.521 --> 00:24:44.510
<v Speaker 1>So if you're going to make us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to make a questionnaire and</v>

405
00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:49.540
<v Speaker 1>some of you will do this when you do</v>
<v Speaker 1>your honors thesis or if you're involved</v>

406
00:24:49.551 --> 00:24:52.910
<v Speaker 1>in research at all and people tend to</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about developing a questionnaire</v>

407
00:24:52.911 --> 00:24:54.650
<v Speaker 1>or something that's relatively</v>
<v Speaker 1>straightforward.</v>

408
00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:56.210
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

409
00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:59.480
<v Speaker 1>You need to figure out what it is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're after.</v>

410
00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:01.850
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's your central construct of</v>

411
00:25:01.851 --> 00:25:03.800
<v Speaker 1>interest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to figure out,</v>

412
00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:09.470
<v Speaker 1>well how do I generate a very large</v>
<v Speaker 1>number of items that hypothetically</v>

413
00:25:09.471 --> 00:25:11.900
<v Speaker 1>measures this or it's reversed or it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>opposite,</v>

414
00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:12.830
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't really matter.</v>

415
00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:16.580
<v Speaker 1>And then a bunch of items that don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>measure it because again,</v>

416
00:25:16.581 --> 00:25:19.280
<v Speaker 1>you have to show that it's good for</v>
<v Speaker 1>something and not good for everything.</v>

417
00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:24.500
<v Speaker 1>So and then you have to demonstrate</v>
<v Speaker 1>statistically that your,</v>

418
00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:30.440
<v Speaker 1>your concept is coherent and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to show that you can use it to</v>

419
00:25:30.441 --> 00:25:33.110
<v Speaker 1>predict something and it gets worse than</v>
<v Speaker 1>that actually.</v>

420
00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:36.470
<v Speaker 1>Then you have to show that it predicts</v>
<v Speaker 1>something better than some other thing</v>

421
00:25:36.471 --> 00:25:38.810
<v Speaker 1>that someone already invented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

422
00:25:38.811 --> 00:25:41.150
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you came up with a fun scale,</v>

423
00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:44.850
<v Speaker 1>it's probably primarily extroversion</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has,</v>

424
00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:47.300
<v Speaker 1>as you mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that a scale like that would measure,</v>

425
00:25:47.301 --> 00:25:50.990
<v Speaker 1>although it'd be a little complicated</v>
<v Speaker 1>because generally fun people also have</v>

426
00:25:50.991 --> 00:25:53.810
<v Speaker 1>less negative emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what you'd end up with,</v>

427
00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:58.160
<v Speaker 1>as we mentioned before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that your fund scale would be a mangling</v>

428
00:25:58.161 --> 00:26:02.570
<v Speaker 1>up of a couple of different categories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it probably ended up not being a</v>

429
00:26:02.571 --> 00:26:03.950
<v Speaker 1>very good questionnaire at all.</v>

430
00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:06.020
<v Speaker 1>So it's a tricky thing to make a</v>
<v Speaker 1>questionnaire,</v>

431
00:26:06.021 --> 00:26:08.360
<v Speaker 1>it takes an awful lot of work and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

432
00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:10.400
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't start with the assumption that</v>

433
00:26:10.401 --> 00:26:14.480
<v Speaker 1>just because you've been able to think</v>
<v Speaker 1>up a concept that it actually</v>

434
00:26:14.481 --> 00:26:19.481
<v Speaker 1>constitutes a concept that meets the</v>
<v Speaker 1>criteria for scientific evidence</v>

435
00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:24.680
<v Speaker 1>for scientific category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we should also talk maybe a little</v>

436
00:26:24.681 --> 00:26:27.740
<v Speaker 1>bit about some different kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>categories because it's not all that</v>

437
00:26:27.741 --> 00:26:31.190
<v Speaker 1>obvious to people that there are</v>
<v Speaker 1>different kinds of categories.</v>

438
00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:35.390
<v Speaker 1>So I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can name three very rapidly.</v>

439
00:26:35.391 --> 00:26:36.940
<v Speaker 1>There are many others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

440
00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:40.340
<v Speaker 1>the first category,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and these are usually the categories</v>

441
00:26:40.341 --> 00:26:45.341
<v Speaker 1>that scientists do investigate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are technically called proper sets</v>

442
00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:53.090
<v Speaker 1>and so a proper said is like the set of</v>
<v Speaker 1>all triangles and triangles are clearly</v>

443
00:26:53.431 --> 00:26:55.830
<v Speaker 1>not squares.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd all agree on that.</v>

444
00:26:55.831 --> 00:26:57.870
<v Speaker 1>So what makes a triangle different than</v>
<v Speaker 1>the square?</v>

445
00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:01.353
<v Speaker 2>Which one?</v>

446
00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:06.520
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just trying to trip you up there.</v>

447
00:27:06.790 --> 00:27:08.020
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

448
00:27:08.021 --> 00:27:10.420
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and is that true of all triangles?</v>

449
00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:12.280
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

450
00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:13.990
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about a triangle that has like is</v>

451
00:27:13.991 --> 00:27:16.990
<v Speaker 1>open on one line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does that qualify as a triangle?</v>

452
00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:19.630
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just looks like a triangle.</v>

453
00:27:19.631 --> 00:27:21.940
<v Speaker 1>It's like an imposter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

454
00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:25.840
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so a proper set has this interesting</v>

455
00:27:25.841 --> 00:27:29.290
<v Speaker 1>characteristic which is it has an</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely clear inclusion and exclusion</v>

456
00:27:29.291 --> 00:27:34.040
<v Speaker 1>criteria and there are no exceptions and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so are almost no exceptions.</v>

457
00:27:34.041 --> 00:27:35.080
<v Speaker 1>So you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

458
00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:39.460
<v Speaker 1>is the set of all helium atoms a proper</v>
<v Speaker 1>set?</v>

459
00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:43.300
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that fundamentally is</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

460
00:27:43.301 --> 00:27:47.680
<v Speaker 1>And is it distinguishable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say from the set of all hydrogen atoms</v>

461
00:27:47.681 --> 00:27:49.480
<v Speaker 1>are the set of all iron atoms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

462
00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:52.390
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's characteristics that you can</v>

463
00:27:52.391 --> 00:27:57.391
<v Speaker 1>define that precisely indicate the</v>
<v Speaker 1>boundaries of the category and those</v>

464
00:27:57.401 --> 00:28:00.040
<v Speaker 1>sorts of things are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are relatively easy to study</v>

465
00:28:00.041 --> 00:28:03.160
<v Speaker 1>scientifically because they tend to</v>
<v Speaker 1>behave similarly in different</v>

466
00:28:03.161 --> 00:28:04.780
<v Speaker 1>circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's,</v>

467
00:28:04.810 --> 00:28:06.940
<v Speaker 1>here's another category,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

468
00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:11.830
<v Speaker 1>it's called a familial resemblance</v>
<v Speaker 1>category and it's a little harder to</v>

469
00:28:11.831 --> 00:28:16.831
<v Speaker 1>understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm a familial resemblance category</v>

470
00:28:17.141 --> 00:28:18.100
<v Speaker 1>is a category that,</v>

471
00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:19.770
<v Speaker 2>that imagine that</v>

472
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:24.890
<v Speaker 1>the prototypical example is the Smith</v>
<v Speaker 1>brothers.</v>

473
00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:28.520
<v Speaker 1>So the Smith brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's some things that could</v>

474
00:28:28.521 --> 00:28:31.120
<v Speaker 1>characterize the Smith brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

475
00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:34.220
<v Speaker 1>large ears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>large nose,</v>

476
00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:37.160
<v Speaker 1>floppy lips,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a glasses,</v>

477
00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:40.670
<v Speaker 1>mustache,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beard and bald.</v>

478
00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:42.860
<v Speaker 1>So they're obviously not very</v>
<v Speaker 1>attractive.</v>

479
00:28:42.861 --> 00:28:47.180
<v Speaker 1>These Smith brothers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you can tell the Smith brothers</v>

480
00:28:47.181 --> 00:28:49.970
<v Speaker 1>are related to each other because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>all look like each other.</v>

481
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.890
<v Speaker 1>Of course they don't look exactly like</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>

482
00:28:51.891 --> 00:28:56.630
<v Speaker 1>So one Smith by the brother is bald with</v>
<v Speaker 1>glasses and floppy lips,</v>

483
00:28:56.631 --> 00:29:00.530
<v Speaker 1>but he has little ears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then another smith brother has hair,</v>

484
00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:01.890
<v Speaker 1>but he's got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

485
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.100
<v Speaker 1>large glasses and large ears and sloppy</v>
<v Speaker 1>lips.</v>

486
00:29:04.101 --> 00:29:08.090
<v Speaker 1>And then there's another Smith's brother</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has a big nose and glasses,</v>

487
00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:12.590
<v Speaker 1>but he has nice hair and no and no</v>
<v Speaker 1>mustache but a beard.</v>

488
00:29:12.591 --> 00:29:14.900
<v Speaker 1>And you get the picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

489
00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:17.480
<v Speaker 1>so</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

490
00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:18.390
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

491
00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:20.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>familial resemblance category.</v>

492
00:29:21.970 --> 00:29:25.970
<v Speaker 1>How a familial resemblance category</v>
<v Speaker 1>works is that there's a list of say 10</v>

493
00:29:25.971 --> 00:29:29.510
<v Speaker 1>attributes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in order to be a member of that</v>

494
00:29:29.511 --> 00:29:31.760
<v Speaker 1>class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you only have to have say four of the</v>

495
00:29:31.761 --> 00:29:34.010
<v Speaker 1>attributes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any four and,</v>

496
00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:35.480
<v Speaker 1>or maybe five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

497
00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:40.850
<v Speaker 1>The weird thing about a familial</v>
<v Speaker 1>resemblance category is that one person</v>

498
00:29:40.851 --> 00:29:42.880
<v Speaker 1>could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four of the attributes and another</v>

499
00:29:43.330 --> 00:29:45.340
<v Speaker 1>person could have four different</v>
<v Speaker 1>attributes.</v>

500
00:29:45.341 --> 00:29:48.910
<v Speaker 1>If there were 10 attributes that total</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they'd still be members of the same</v>

501
00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:52.570
<v Speaker 1>set even though they don't share any</v>
<v Speaker 1>attributes in common.</v>

502
00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:56.620
<v Speaker 1>And what familial resemblance category</v>
<v Speaker 1>works,</v>

503
00:29:57.190 --> 00:29:58.900
<v Speaker 1>because each of the</v>

504
00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:05.790
<v Speaker 1>members of the category related to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>central prototype and the prototype has</v>

505
00:30:05.791 --> 00:30:08.640
<v Speaker 1>all the features and the prototype might</v>
<v Speaker 1>not even exist.</v>

506
00:30:08.641 --> 00:30:11.550
<v Speaker 1>So there could be a prototypical smith</v>
<v Speaker 1>brother who would have all the</v>

507
00:30:11.551 --> 00:30:14.280
<v Speaker 1>characteristics of the Smith brothers</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I described,</v>

508
00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:16.830
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't even exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

509
00:30:17.010 --> 00:30:19.020
<v Speaker 1>he's like an amalgam of all the Smith</v>
<v Speaker 1>brothers.</v>

510
00:30:19.021 --> 00:30:22.500
<v Speaker 1>And then each of the Smith brothers are</v>
<v Speaker 1>related in some way to that central</v>

511
00:30:22.501 --> 00:30:25.830
<v Speaker 1>prototype so that you can tell that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>belong in a family and that's not a</v>

512
00:30:25.831 --> 00:30:28.740
<v Speaker 1>proper set.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things you know you,</v>

513
00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:30.930
<v Speaker 1>you might be asking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well why should you know this?</v>

514
00:30:30.931 --> 00:30:34.860
<v Speaker 1>And one reason is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is because it's useful to know that</v>

515
00:30:34.861 --> 00:30:39.720
<v Speaker 1>there are different forms of categories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more particularly for psychological</v>

516
00:30:39.721 --> 00:30:42.840
<v Speaker 1>purposes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Psychiatric diagnostic categories are</v>

517
00:30:42.841 --> 00:30:44.580
<v Speaker 1>familiar with that resemblance</v>
<v Speaker 1>categories.</v>

518
00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:48.090
<v Speaker 1>They're not proper sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you go into the diagnostic and</v>

519
00:30:48.091 --> 00:30:53.091
<v Speaker 1>statistical manual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the sort of Apa American</v>

520
00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:54.630
<v Speaker 1>Psychiatric Association Bible for doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>diagnosis,</v>

521
00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:58.530
<v Speaker 1>you'll see that if you list the symptoms</v>
<v Speaker 1>of something like a personality</v>

522
00:30:58.531 --> 00:31:00.270
<v Speaker 1>disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there might be 10 symptoms.</v>

523
00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:02.490
<v Speaker 1>And in order to have that personality</v>
<v Speaker 1>disorder,</v>

524
00:31:02.491 --> 00:31:07.491
<v Speaker 1>you only need four of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so there can be wide variation</v>

525
00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:10.200
<v Speaker 1>within the category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course then that begs the</v>

526
00:31:10.201 --> 00:31:13.680
<v Speaker 1>question of whether or not it's actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>a category of certainly whether or not</v>

527
00:31:13.681 --> 00:31:16.560
<v Speaker 1>it's actually a scientific category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

528
00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:19.413
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

529
00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:23.810
<v Speaker 1>not guy named Barcelona talked about a</v>
<v Speaker 1>different kind of category.</v>

530
00:31:23.811 --> 00:31:27.830
<v Speaker 1>He called them ad hoc categories and</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are strange things like here's,</v>

531
00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:32.860
<v Speaker 1>here's an ad hoc category for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things to take out of your apartment</v>

532
00:31:33.531 --> 00:31:38.130
<v Speaker 1>when it's on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what things would those be?</v>

533
00:31:41.010 --> 00:31:41.843
<v Speaker 1>Pictures?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

534
00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:44.190
<v Speaker 1>Pets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

535
00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:47.850
<v Speaker 1>Children</v>
<v Speaker 1>forgot about that.</v>

536
00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:49.470
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What else?</v>

537
00:31:52.330 --> 00:31:53.380
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seniors.</v>

538
00:31:53.381 --> 00:31:54.310
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully.</v>

539
00:31:54.690 --> 00:31:55.920
<v Speaker 4>Or.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

540
00:31:57.260 --> 00:31:58.093
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

541
00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:00.960
<v Speaker 1>Insurance id.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

542
00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:03.300
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything else?</v>

543
00:32:03.301 --> 00:32:04.200
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you might say,</v>

544
00:32:04.201 --> 00:32:05.790
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are all those things have in common</v>

545
00:32:05.791 --> 00:32:07.380
<v Speaker 1>since there apparently a category.</v>

546
00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:10.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

547
00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:11.840
<v Speaker 1>there are things you care about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

548
00:32:12.170 --> 00:32:13.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Id.</v>

549
00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:18.650
<v Speaker 1>Do you care about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need it?</v>

550
00:32:18.651 --> 00:32:20.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're necessary or</v>

551
00:32:22.390 --> 00:32:25.360
<v Speaker 1>emotionally valuable or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or what,</v>

552
00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:26.770
<v Speaker 1>or valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

553
00:32:26.771 --> 00:32:29.110
<v Speaker 1>Are irreplaceable in some ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

554
00:32:29.111 --> 00:32:32.350
<v Speaker 1>So that's a funny category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one in Barcelona is claims was that</v>

555
00:32:32.351 --> 00:32:36.280
<v Speaker 1>ad hoc categories can become automatic</v>
<v Speaker 1>categories,</v>

556
00:32:36.281 --> 00:32:38.500
<v Speaker 1>perceptual categories if you practice</v>
<v Speaker 1>them enough.</v>

557
00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:43.870
<v Speaker 1>So Bursa would say a fireman has a</v>
<v Speaker 1>better ad hoc category of what to take</v>

558
00:32:44.241 --> 00:32:48.920
<v Speaker 1>out of an apartment during a fire than</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do because he's practiced that using</v>

559
00:32:48.921 --> 00:32:52.910
<v Speaker 1>that category frequently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those are categories that sort of</v>

560
00:32:52.911 --> 00:32:56.360
<v Speaker 1>have pragmatic utility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's another kind of category.</v>

561
00:32:56.361 --> 00:32:58.220
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'd mentioned family resemblance,</v>

562
00:32:58.221 --> 00:33:01.970
<v Speaker 1>proper set,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and ad hoc categories.</v>

563
00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:04.320
<v Speaker 1>That's all I can sort of spin off and</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

564
00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:06.720
<v Speaker 1>in real time here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm</v>

565
00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:13.770
<v Speaker 1>generally what you're trying to do when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you extract a word out from the</v>

566
00:33:13.771 --> 00:33:17.340
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to demonstrate it,</v>

567
00:33:17.341 --> 00:33:20.640
<v Speaker 1>that it has the characteristics of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>proper set before you can think of it as</v>

568
00:33:20.641 --> 00:33:23.160
<v Speaker 1>having some genuinely objective</v>
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>

569
00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:25.980
<v Speaker 1>And that turns out to be a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult thing to do.</v>

570
00:33:26.550 --> 00:33:28.310
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's one of the things that throws</v>

571
00:33:28.311 --> 00:33:32.910
<v Speaker 1>psychologists for a loop constantly</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we make the presupposition that</v>

572
00:33:32.911 --> 00:33:36.360
<v Speaker 1>just because the word two different</v>
<v Speaker 1>words exist for something that that</v>

573
00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:40.710
<v Speaker 1>signifies to different things or two</v>
<v Speaker 1>things at all.</v>

574
00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:42.420
<v Speaker 1>And so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

575
00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:45.030
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's difficult to disentangle your</v>

576
00:33:45.031 --> 00:33:47.190
<v Speaker 1>description of the world from the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself,</v>

577
00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:51.630
<v Speaker 1>but hypothetically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this construct validation process with</v>

578
00:33:51.631 --> 00:33:55.320
<v Speaker 1>regards to questionnaires is one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways that you can step forward towards</v>

579
00:33:55.321 --> 00:34:00.321
<v Speaker 1>doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned convergent and discriminant</v>

580
00:34:00.661 --> 00:34:02.610
<v Speaker 1>validity before,</v>

581
00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:09.190
<v Speaker 1>once you get your scale established,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to demonstrate,</v>

582
00:34:09.191 --> 00:34:12.330
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it measures something that,</v>

583
00:34:12.610 --> 00:34:15.310
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that exists in some real way,</v>

584
00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:20.200
<v Speaker 1>and that it also has to be separable for</v>
<v Speaker 1>measures of other things.</v>

585
00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:23.890
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you generated up a scale that</v>

586
00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:27.760
<v Speaker 1>measured fun and you found out that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was highly correlated with other scales</v>

587
00:34:27.761 --> 00:34:31.090
<v Speaker 1>that measure anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that would cast some doubt on</v>

588
00:34:31.091 --> 00:34:35.230
<v Speaker 1>whether or not unit you had</v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriately extracted out your scale</v>

589
00:34:35.890 --> 00:34:40.510
<v Speaker 1>for fun and other people would have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at similar things over the</v>

590
00:34:40.510 --> 00:34:42.550
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And hopefully your scale would correlate</v>

591
00:34:42.551 --> 00:34:45.970
<v Speaker 1>positively with those similar things and</v>
<v Speaker 1>negatively with the things that you</v>

592
00:34:45.971 --> 00:34:48.820
<v Speaker 1>assume to be different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's convergent and divergent</v>

593
00:34:48.821 --> 00:34:51.520
<v Speaker 1>validity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the criterion related validity,</v>

594
00:34:51.521 --> 00:34:56.521
<v Speaker 1>we're already talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

595
00:35:00.131 --> 00:35:01.900
<v Speaker 1>so now I want to show you a different,</v>

596
00:35:02.970 --> 00:35:05.290
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>powerpoint presentation just for them.</v>

597
00:35:08.070 --> 00:35:08.903
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

598
00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:35.710
<v Speaker 1>so this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think about this as the</v>

599
00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:42.110
<v Speaker 1>current arguably standard model of human</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality and it's a model that,</v>

600
00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:48.660
<v Speaker 1>this is only half of it by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's another slide that has the other</v>

601
00:35:48.661 --> 00:35:53.661
<v Speaker 1>half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This shows the personality of a person</v>

602
00:35:54.810 --> 00:35:59.160
<v Speaker 1>laid out in hierarchy from most general</v>
<v Speaker 1>to most specific.</v>

603
00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:04.350
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of analogous to that little</v>
<v Speaker 1>drawing I showed you of behaviors at the</v>

604
00:36:04.351 --> 00:36:07.290
<v Speaker 1>bottom and then higher order descriptors</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the top,</v>

605
00:36:07.291 --> 00:36:10.050
<v Speaker 1>although they don't map onto each other</v>
<v Speaker 1>one to one.</v>

606
00:36:10.051 --> 00:36:12.480
<v Speaker 1>And that's actually one of the things</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to figure out.</v>

607
00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:15.330
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to.</v>

608
00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:25.470
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to map the trait</v>
<v Speaker 1>theories directly onto the narrative and</v>

609
00:36:25.541 --> 00:36:27.670
<v Speaker 1>the clinical theories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

610
00:36:27.671 --> 00:36:32.671
<v Speaker 1>so at the highest level of resolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's how people can differ from one</v>

611
00:36:34.151 --> 00:36:39.151
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can be industrious or orderly and</v>

612
00:36:39.191 --> 00:36:44.191
<v Speaker 1>that those two aspects</v>
<v Speaker 1>are quite highly inter correlated,</v>

613
00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:50.090
<v Speaker 1>but in sufficiently differentiable so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the differences are interesting.</v>

614
00:36:50.091 --> 00:36:53.420
<v Speaker 1>Industriousness in order to dentists</v>
<v Speaker 1>seem to predict different things.</v>

615
00:36:53.690 --> 00:36:55.040
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>industrious,</v>

616
00:36:55.041 --> 00:36:58.250
<v Speaker 1>this seems to be a better predictor of</v>
<v Speaker 1>academic achievement than orderliness</v>

617
00:36:58.251 --> 00:37:00.650
<v Speaker 1>does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though they both both clump under</v>

618
00:37:00.651 --> 00:37:01.670
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness</v>

619
00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:07.050
<v Speaker 1>and then there's volatility in</v>
<v Speaker 1>withdrawal for emotional stability or</v>

620
00:37:07.051 --> 00:37:11.850
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism described different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's your neurotic,</v>

621
00:37:11.851 --> 00:37:14.580
<v Speaker 1>if you feel a lot of negative emotion</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're emotionally stable,</v>

622
00:37:14.581 --> 00:37:18.030
<v Speaker 1>if you don't negative the negative</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions that are associated with</v>

623
00:37:18.031 --> 00:37:20.250
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we thought for a long time it was all</v>

624
00:37:20.251 --> 00:37:22.680
<v Speaker 1>negative emotions that were associated</v>
<v Speaker 1>with neuroticism,</v>

625
00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:28.100
<v Speaker 1>but it seems to be more like pain and</v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety and and and pain is somewhat</v>

626
00:37:29.401 --> 00:37:32.970
<v Speaker 1>equivalent to the emotion you feel if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're frustrated or disappointed or</v>

627
00:37:32.971 --> 00:37:35.760
<v Speaker 1>grieving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And anxiety seems to be the emotion you</v>

628
00:37:35.761 --> 00:37:40.470
<v Speaker 1>feel when you're subject to</v>
<v Speaker 1>uncontrollable or unexpected</v>

629
00:37:40.471 --> 00:37:45.471
<v Speaker 1>circumstances or when you're subject to</v>
<v Speaker 1>cues of frustration,</v>

630
00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:49.530
<v Speaker 1>disappointment or grief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

631
00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:52.410
<v Speaker 1>volatile people</v>

632
00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:57.310
<v Speaker 1>don't really seem to avoid because of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their negative emotion.</v>

633
00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:00.100
<v Speaker 1>Although their emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

634
00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:02.910
<v Speaker 1>their emotions bounced a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially their negative emotions.</v>

635
00:38:02.911 --> 00:38:05.560
<v Speaker 1>So if you're associated with someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's voluntell,</v>

636
00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:10.420
<v Speaker 1>what you would observe is that they seem</v>
<v Speaker 1>to overreact to things.</v>

637
00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:16.260
<v Speaker 1>They get more irritated then they</v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstance might seem to indicate and</v>

638
00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:19.900
<v Speaker 1>their emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional response to things is on the</v>

639
00:38:19.901 --> 00:38:23.230
<v Speaker 1>negative end is relatively unpredictable</v>
<v Speaker 1>day to day,</v>

640
00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:27.160
<v Speaker 1>so there's a lot of variability and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lower threshold for the experience.</v>

641
00:38:27.370 --> 00:38:32.370
<v Speaker 1>People who withdraw are people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>appear to be stopped by their</v>

642
00:38:34.511 --> 00:38:35.860
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>negative emotion,</v>

643
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:39.280
<v Speaker 1>so if they're afraid of something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they won't do it where the volatile</v>

644
00:38:39.281 --> 00:38:40.570
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might do it,</v>

645
00:38:40.571 --> 00:38:42.250
<v Speaker 1>but they'll complain a lot while they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it,</v>

646
00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:45.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we don't know a lot about the</v>

647
00:38:45.101 --> 00:38:48.040
<v Speaker 1>difference between volatility and</v>
<v Speaker 1>withdrawal yet because those have been</v>

648
00:38:48.041 --> 00:38:52.300
<v Speaker 1>recently extracted out using statistical</v>
<v Speaker 1>means and they seem stable,</v>

649
00:38:52.301 --> 00:38:56.450
<v Speaker 1>but exactly what they predict yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apart from the few things that I tend to</v>

650
00:38:56.460 --> 00:38:58.510
<v Speaker 1>definitely suggested to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't yet clear.</v>

651
00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:03.040
<v Speaker 1>Agreeableness sounds like a positive</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

652
00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:07.810
<v Speaker 1>Politeness and compassion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that liberals are more</v>

653
00:39:07.811 --> 00:39:10.960
<v Speaker 1>compassionate and conservatives are more</v>
<v Speaker 1>polite,</v>

654
00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:16.540
<v Speaker 1>but we don't know a lot more about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>distinction between politeness and</v>

655
00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:18.520
<v Speaker 1>compassion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

656
00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:25.180
<v Speaker 1>and we don't know why conservatives are</v>
<v Speaker 1>more polite than liberals are more</v>

657
00:39:25.181 --> 00:39:28.090
<v Speaker 1>compassionate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we do know that that appears to be</v>

658
00:39:28.091 --> 00:39:29.800
<v Speaker 1>the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We also know by the way that</v>

659
00:39:29.801 --> 00:39:33.970
<v Speaker 1>conservatives are more orderly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're less open as well,</v>

660
00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.760
<v Speaker 1>which is the dimension we'll talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a moment.</v>

661
00:39:37.090 --> 00:39:40.210
<v Speaker 1>Those three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are three of the five big five</v>

662
00:39:40.211 --> 00:39:41.350
<v Speaker 1>traits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness,</v>

663
00:39:41.351 --> 00:39:44.770
<v Speaker 1>emotional stability and agreeableness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They clumped together to make a super</v>

664
00:39:44.771 --> 00:39:49.771
<v Speaker 1>factor called stability and stability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Looks like it might be associated with</v>

665
00:39:50.231 --> 00:39:54.640
<v Speaker 1>higher levels of Serotonin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Serotonin is a major brain</v>

666
00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:59.440
<v Speaker 1>neurotransmitter that seems to regulate</v>
<v Speaker 1>broadly speaking,</v>

667
00:39:59.470 --> 00:40:04.470
<v Speaker 1>emotion and motivation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if your serotonin levels so to</v>

668
00:40:05.081 --> 00:40:06.430
<v Speaker 1>speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are relatively high,</v>

669
00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:11.760
<v Speaker 1>then you're a relatively stable person</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if your serotonin levels are low,</v>

670
00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:14.590
<v Speaker 1>then you tend to be impulsive and prone</v>
<v Speaker 1>to negative emotion.</v>

671
00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:16.630
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that's quite</v>

672
00:40:16.631 --> 00:40:20.890
<v Speaker 1>interesting about Serotonin is that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>tracks your position in the dominance</v>

673
00:40:20.891 --> 00:40:24.760
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the higher you are up in a given</v>

674
00:40:24.761 --> 00:40:27.490
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more serotonin in your brain</v>

675
00:40:27.491 --> 00:40:31.240
<v Speaker 1>produces and that makes you more</v>
<v Speaker 1>confident and less unstable.</v>

676
00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:35.170
<v Speaker 1>And the lower you are in the hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lower your brain serotonin levels.</v>

677
00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:39.820
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that seems to be that</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're low in the dominance</v>

678
00:40:39.821 --> 00:40:41.650
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while you should be afraid,</v>

679
00:40:41.651 --> 00:40:46.210
<v Speaker 1>because almost anything can knock you</v>
<v Speaker 1>into oblivion because if you're right at</v>

680
00:40:46.211 --> 00:40:48.250
<v Speaker 1>the bottom of the dominance hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're barely,</v>

681
00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:50.110
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're barely hanging on and you just</v>

682
00:40:50.111 --> 00:40:52.840
<v Speaker 1>can't tolerate any more threat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And conversely,</v>

683
00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:57.070
<v Speaker 1>it might also be appropriate for you if</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone dangles a reward in front of you</v>

684
00:40:57.071 --> 00:40:59.410
<v Speaker 1>for you to grab it because it's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly clear,</v>

685
00:40:59.411 --> 00:41:01.600
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be the next day or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>next day.</v>

686
00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:03.880
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if you're up high in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy,</v>

687
00:41:03.881 --> 00:41:08.800
<v Speaker 1>it's like you can take a lot of billows</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're so well situated socially</v>

688
00:41:08.801 --> 00:41:11.590
<v Speaker 1>that it's probably not going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>overwhelm you that much and you don't</v>

689
00:41:11.591 --> 00:41:15.670
<v Speaker 1>have to be impulsive because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>microenvironment that you inhabit is</v>

690
00:41:15.671 --> 00:41:18.940
<v Speaker 1>very stable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the negative emotion dimension,</v>

691
00:41:18.941 --> 00:41:22.330
<v Speaker 1>emotional stability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is particularly associated with</v>

692
00:41:22.331 --> 00:41:25.660
<v Speaker 1>serotonergic function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we think that the whole super factor</v>

693
00:41:25.661 --> 00:41:28.990
<v Speaker 1>of stability is associated with</v>
<v Speaker 1>serotonergic tone.</v>

694
00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:33.620
<v Speaker 1>So some of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I mentioned already,</v>

695
00:41:33.621 --> 00:41:37.250
<v Speaker 1>all of these different</v>
<v Speaker 1>aspects,</v>

696
00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:40.250
<v Speaker 1>traits and super factors role derived</v>
<v Speaker 1>statistically,</v>

697
00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:45.550
<v Speaker 1>but evidence has continued to accrue</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the last 20 years with regards to</v>

698
00:41:46.371 --> 00:41:50.630
<v Speaker 1>the biological substrate of the traits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so as we progress through them one</v>

699
00:41:50.631 --> 00:41:53.420
<v Speaker 1>by one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll also talk about hypothetically</v>

700
00:41:53.421 --> 00:41:55.490
<v Speaker 1>what constitutes the underlying biology</v>

701
00:41:57.630 --> 00:41:59.820
<v Speaker 1>agreeable people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

702
00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:03.150
<v Speaker 1>I think the easiest way to conceptualize</v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness as is,</v>

703
00:42:03.151 --> 00:42:07.380
<v Speaker 1>as I'm a negotiating strategy in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

704
00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:11.610
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're always attempting to divide up</v>

705
00:42:11.611 --> 00:42:16.611
<v Speaker 1>resources between you and other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a disagreeable person will make a</v>

706
00:42:17.101 --> 00:42:20.760
<v Speaker 1>pretty damn strong case that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>resources should go to them.</v>

707
00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:26.480
<v Speaker 1>Whereas an agreeable person will be much</v>
<v Speaker 1>more likely to under represent their own</v>

708
00:42:27.870 --> 00:42:30.360
<v Speaker 1>interest and over represent the interest</v>
<v Speaker 1>of others.</v>

709
00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:31.493
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

710
00:42:31.650 --> 00:42:34.650
<v Speaker 1>in some ways people like that are very</v>
<v Speaker 1>pleasant to be around,</v>

711
00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:39.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're always doing things for</v>

712
00:42:39.451 --> 00:42:42.210
<v Speaker 1>other people on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately they're often not doing</v>

713
00:42:42.211 --> 00:42:44.520
<v Speaker 1>enough for themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In my clinical practice,</v>

714
00:42:44.521 --> 00:42:47.280
<v Speaker 1>I can always tell who the agreeable</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are because when they come and</v>

715
00:42:47.281 --> 00:42:48.420
<v Speaker 1>see me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they bring me coffee.</v>

716
00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:51.000
<v Speaker 1>The disagreeable people bring themselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee,</v>

717
00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:53.100
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

718
00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:02.193
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

719
00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:07.300
<v Speaker 1>Pretty sad animation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The aspects here,</v>

720
00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:10.840
<v Speaker 1>so openness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember you guys hypothesize that</v>

721
00:43:10.841 --> 00:43:15.841
<v Speaker 1>intelligence was unrelated to fund I'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>find is pretty much an extroversion sub</v>

722
00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:20.230
<v Speaker 1>element.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And intelligence is associated with</v>

723
00:43:20.231 --> 00:43:22.450
<v Speaker 1>openness and it roughly breaks down like</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

724
00:43:22.451 --> 00:43:23.990
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

725
00:43:24.850 --> 00:43:29.710
<v Speaker 1>Iq is probably a better measure of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>aspect.</v>

726
00:43:29.711 --> 00:43:33.700
<v Speaker 1>Intellect Iq tests are a better measure</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the subscale intellect than</v>

727
00:43:33.701 --> 00:43:36.670
<v Speaker 1>personality measures are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what it means is that for,</v>

728
00:43:36.910 --> 00:43:38.590
<v Speaker 1>for intellect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for intelligence,</v>

729
00:43:38.591 --> 00:43:43.090
<v Speaker 1>we have a measure that isn't merely self</v>
<v Speaker 1>report and it's a good measure.</v>

730
00:43:43.091 --> 00:43:46.510
<v Speaker 1>And we'll talk a lot about intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually a very easy,</v>

731
00:43:46.890 --> 00:43:50.140
<v Speaker 1>it's a simple thing to conceptualize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

732
00:43:50.490 --> 00:43:52.330
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

733
00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:54.610
<v Speaker 1>it's a more difficult thing to try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>explain,</v>

734
00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:56.710
<v Speaker 1>but conceptually it's fairly</v>
<v Speaker 1>straightforward.</v>

735
00:43:57.340 --> 00:44:01.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other aspect of openness is openness</v>

736
00:44:01.721 --> 00:44:04.390
<v Speaker 1>proper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put creativity here and what that</v>

737
00:44:04.391 --> 00:44:09.391
<v Speaker 1>seems to be associated with is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>degree to which someone is a variety of</v>

738
00:44:09.911 --> 00:44:11.680
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of them seems to be the degree</v>

739
00:44:11.681 --> 00:44:16.681
<v Speaker 1>to which a given idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you throw someone an idea or you</v>

740
00:44:16.961 --> 00:44:20.350
<v Speaker 1>offer someone idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some probability that that's</v>

741
00:44:20.351 --> 00:44:21.880
<v Speaker 1>going to make them think of other</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

742
00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:27.730
<v Speaker 1>The more open someone is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more likely it is that any given</v>

743
00:44:27.731 --> 00:44:30.130
<v Speaker 1>idea is gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make them think of more things and also</v>

744
00:44:31.170 --> 00:44:36.170
<v Speaker 1>the open person has a more diverse range</v>
<v Speaker 1>of things that that idea might bring</v>

745
00:44:36.181 --> 00:44:41.181
<v Speaker 1>about and so often a speaking style of</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who's open is associated is</v>

746
00:44:42.541 --> 00:44:45.020
<v Speaker 1>characterized by relatively loose</v>
<v Speaker 1>associations.</v>

747
00:44:45.021 --> 00:44:45.854
<v Speaker 1>I mean</v>

748
00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:52.000
<v Speaker 1>that like my lectures for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's a measure of creativity,</v>

749
00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:57.890
<v Speaker 1>but it's also a measure in some sense of</v>
<v Speaker 1>lack of constraint on,</v>

750
00:44:58.390 --> 00:45:02.990
<v Speaker 1>on the propagation of ideas through the</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea network and I don't know exactly</v>

751
00:45:02.991 --> 00:45:06.230
<v Speaker 1>what that means neurologically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do know that you can be relatively</v>

752
00:45:06.231 --> 00:45:10.220
<v Speaker 1>high and intelligence and relatively low</v>
<v Speaker 1>in openness or creativity,</v>

753
00:45:10.221 --> 00:45:13.400
<v Speaker 1>but the two things do tend to go very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

754
00:45:13.401 --> 00:45:18.401
<v Speaker 1>it's very rare for people to make any</v>
<v Speaker 1>major contribution to a creative sphere</v>

755
00:45:19.011 --> 00:45:23.060
<v Speaker 1>unless they have an Iq of over least</v>
<v Speaker 1>over 120.</v>

756
00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:26.340
<v Speaker 1>So it's a pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty selective one in 20,</v>

757
00:45:26.370 --> 00:45:31.370
<v Speaker 1>120.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's about the 90th 91st 92nd</v>

758
00:45:31.611 --> 00:45:33.080
<v Speaker 1>percentile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's pretty high.</v>

759
00:45:33.890 --> 00:45:37.580
<v Speaker 1>So openness is creativity and</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>

760
00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:41.570
<v Speaker 1>It's a bit broader than that too though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because open people are also more</v>

761
00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:46.850
<v Speaker 1>capable of aesthetic experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not only that they are more</v>

762
00:45:46.851 --> 00:45:49.880
<v Speaker 1>creative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they also enjoy the products of</v>

763
00:45:49.881 --> 00:45:53.090
<v Speaker 1>creative endeavor more than non open</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

764
00:45:53.090 --> 00:45:57.140
<v Speaker 1>So open people are going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in dance and music and poetry</v>

765
00:45:57.290 --> 00:45:59.420
<v Speaker 1>and philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

766
00:46:00.350 --> 00:46:03.740
<v Speaker 1>they're characterized by the capacity</v>
<v Speaker 1>for aesthetic experiences,</v>

767
00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:06.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so some people can listen to music and</v>

768
00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:10.070
<v Speaker 1>the hair on the back of their neck stand</v>
<v Speaker 1>up or maybe they get the same sensation</v>

769
00:46:10.071 --> 00:46:14.870
<v Speaker 1>when they're watching someone dance or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm just out of curiosity,</v>

770
00:46:14.930 --> 00:46:18.890
<v Speaker 1>if you're inclined to answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many of you have had the experience</v>

771
00:46:18.891 --> 00:46:20.600
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's called [inaudible] erection</v>

772
00:46:20.601 --> 00:46:22.820
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because sometimes the hairs on your arms</v>

773
00:46:22.821 --> 00:46:26.960
<v Speaker 1>will stand up to as a consequence of</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching something that's aesthetic</v>

774
00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:30.080
<v Speaker 1>movie or how many.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quite a lot of you.</v>

775
00:46:30.081 --> 00:46:32.930
<v Speaker 1>How many haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

776
00:46:32.931 --> 00:46:34.160
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So while there's a lot of,</v>

777
00:46:34.850 --> 00:46:36.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by that measure anyways,</v>

778
00:46:36.321 --> 00:46:38.540
<v Speaker 1>there's a lawful lot of open people in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this class.</v>

779
00:46:38.930 --> 00:46:40.050
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

780
00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:44.210
<v Speaker 1>that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way of having your hairs on the</v>

781
00:46:44.211 --> 00:46:48.550
<v Speaker 1>back of your neck stand up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's sort of a remnant of the pilot</v>

782
00:46:48.580 --> 00:46:51.260
<v Speaker 1>erection reflex.</v>

783
00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:54.100
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say you,</v>

784
00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:56.270
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're watching a cat and the cat comes</v>

785
00:46:56.271 --> 00:46:58.190
<v Speaker 1>around a corner and all of a sudden</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a dog there.</v>

786
00:46:58.191 --> 00:47:03.191
<v Speaker 1>What happens to the cat goes right puffs</v>
<v Speaker 1>right up.</v>

787
00:47:03.891 --> 00:47:06.350
<v Speaker 1>Even.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now it's tales about this big around</v>

788
00:47:06.351 --> 00:47:07.380
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when it started,</v>

789
00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:12.200
<v Speaker 1>but it puffs right out and it's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an automatic reflex on the part</v>

790
00:47:12.201 --> 00:47:14.180
<v Speaker 1>of the cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's trying to look like it's big.</v>

791
00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:15.021
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris,</v>

792
00:47:15.021 --> 00:47:17.630
<v Speaker 1>the dog will do the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's a bit counterproductive.</v>

793
00:47:17.631 --> 00:47:19.550
<v Speaker 1>But whatever the cat's trying to look</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

794
00:47:19.551 --> 00:47:22.070
<v Speaker 1>it occupies a lot more space than it</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually looks like.</v>

795
00:47:22.071 --> 00:47:23.030
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's also,</v>

796
00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:25.760
<v Speaker 1>at least in principle and emotion</v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with that,</v>

797
00:47:25.761 --> 00:47:29.200
<v Speaker 1>which is one of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of a combination of terror and</v>

798
00:47:29.201 --> 00:47:33.100
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that's what the cat seals.</v>

799
00:47:33.101 --> 00:47:37.360
<v Speaker 1>But that's what they are experience of</v>
<v Speaker 1>awe.</v>

800
00:47:38.170 --> 00:47:40.810
<v Speaker 1>Even filtered down is still associated</v>
<v Speaker 1>with that,</v>

801
00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:42.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience of pilot direction.</v>

802
00:47:42.731 --> 00:47:45.880
<v Speaker 1>So that's pretty interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So extroverted people,</v>

803
00:47:45.970 --> 00:47:47.680
<v Speaker 1>or at least I think it's pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting,</v>

804
00:47:48.130 --> 00:47:53.130
<v Speaker 1>extroverted people are assertive and</v>
<v Speaker 1>enthusiastic and so the enthusiasm</v>

805
00:47:53.831 --> 00:47:57.340
<v Speaker 1>dimension seems to be associated with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of overt,</v>

806
00:47:57.341 --> 00:48:01.600
<v Speaker 1>positive emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so extroverts in many ways are more</v>

807
00:48:01.601 --> 00:48:03.430
<v Speaker 1>fun and they laugh more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They talk more.</v>

808
00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:07.030
<v Speaker 1>That is not necessarily more fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're very gregarious.</v>

809
00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:09.070
<v Speaker 1>They like to hang out at parties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They planned parties,</v>

810
00:48:09.071 --> 00:48:10.570
<v Speaker 1>they tell jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

811
00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:12.910
<v Speaker 1>telling a joke is actually a real marker</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

812
00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:15.820
<v Speaker 1>of extroversion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how many of you here tell jokes?</v>

813
00:48:17.660 --> 00:48:19.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many don't.</v>

814
00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:21.821
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

815
00:48:21.821 --> 00:48:22.810
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

816
00:48:22.811 --> 00:48:27.040
<v Speaker 1>how many of you tell good jokes</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyways?</v>

817
00:48:27.130 --> 00:48:30.790
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm also one of the behavioral markers</v>

818
00:48:30.791 --> 00:48:33.940
<v Speaker 1>we found for extroversion was that</v>
<v Speaker 1>extroverted people also tell dirty</v>

819
00:48:33.941 --> 00:48:36.520
<v Speaker 1>jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how many of you are capable of that</v>

820
00:48:36.521 --> 00:48:37.870
<v Speaker 1>particular act?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

821
00:48:37.871 --> 00:48:39.510
<v Speaker 1>So you in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

822
00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:41.530
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

823
00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:45.310
<v Speaker 1>So the assertiveness element of</v>
<v Speaker 1>extroversion.</v>

824
00:48:45.610 --> 00:48:47.530
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess sometimes that's the part of</v>

825
00:48:47.531 --> 00:48:50.500
<v Speaker 1>extroversion that maybe isn't so much</v>
<v Speaker 1>fun because extroverts can be very</v>

826
00:48:50.501 --> 00:48:55.450
<v Speaker 1>verbally dominant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I do in my fourth year</v>

827
00:48:56.170 --> 00:49:00.250
<v Speaker 1>undergraduate personality seminar is I</v>
<v Speaker 1>split the group and take introverts.</v>

828
00:49:00.251 --> 00:49:03.820
<v Speaker 1>And extroverts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so because I often have the class do</v>

829
00:49:03.821 --> 00:49:07.450
<v Speaker 1>debates and if if you put an extrovert</v>
<v Speaker 1>in with a bunch of introverts and</v>

830
00:49:07.451 --> 00:49:10.120
<v Speaker 1>there's a debate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's one extrovert here in three</v>

831
00:49:10.121 --> 00:49:12.400
<v Speaker 1>introverts and one extrovert here at</v>
<v Speaker 1>three introverts.</v>

832
00:49:12.730 --> 00:49:16.870
<v Speaker 1>Then the two extroverts have the debate</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the introverts don't say anything</v>

833
00:49:17.410 --> 00:49:20.440
<v Speaker 1>and introverts are interesting because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like they don't have anything</v>

834
00:49:20.441 --> 00:49:23.770
<v Speaker 1>to say because if you pointed an</v>
<v Speaker 1>introvert and say,</v>

835
00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:25.960
<v Speaker 1>do you have something to say?</v>

836
00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:27.970
<v Speaker 1>Then they'll say something that they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>

837
00:49:27.971 --> 00:49:30.820
<v Speaker 1>but they'll very rarely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're very introverted,</v>

838
00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:34.030
<v Speaker 1>they're very rarely offered</v>
<v Speaker 1>spontaneously.</v>

839
00:49:34.570 --> 00:49:39.570
<v Speaker 1>And so if I found that if I divide the</v>
<v Speaker 1>class into two groups of introverts in</v>

840
00:49:39.581 --> 00:49:42.790
<v Speaker 1>two groups of extroverts and then I have</v>
<v Speaker 1>them do like a four way debate.</v>

841
00:49:42.940 --> 00:49:45.670
<v Speaker 1>The introverts so talk like mad in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in their,</v>

842
00:49:45.700 --> 00:49:47.560
<v Speaker 1>in their own group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

843
00:49:47.561 --> 00:49:51.190
<v Speaker 1>because they're not being overpowered by</v>
<v Speaker 1>an extrovert.</v>

844
00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:54.050
<v Speaker 1>The extrovert seemed to have a much</v>
<v Speaker 1>lower threshold for,</v>

845
00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:57.430
<v Speaker 1>for speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't take much of a stimulus to</v>

846
00:49:57.431 --> 00:50:00.400
<v Speaker 1>get them talking or they have a real</v>
<v Speaker 1>impulse to talk.</v>

847
00:50:00.401 --> 00:50:03.220
<v Speaker 1>Like my daughter is super introverted or</v>
<v Speaker 1>extroverted.</v>

848
00:50:03.221 --> 00:50:05.890
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible for her to think</v>
<v Speaker 1>something without saying it,</v>

849
00:50:06.730 --> 00:50:09.730
<v Speaker 1>so I know which is not always to her</v>
<v Speaker 1>benefit,</v>

850
00:50:10.030 --> 00:50:10.910
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

851
00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:13.810
<v Speaker 1>I extroverts have a real impulse to</v>
<v Speaker 1>speech,</v>

852
00:50:13.811 --> 00:50:15.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas introverts,</v>

853
00:50:15.191 --> 00:50:19.030
<v Speaker 1>they have to be sort of prodded into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Extroverts also seemed to be sort of,</v>

854
00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:21.520
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>

855
00:50:21.610 --> 00:50:24.590
<v Speaker 1>Energized by social interactions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

856
00:50:24.730 --> 00:50:27.130
<v Speaker 1>they'll go to a party and they get more</v>
<v Speaker 1>and more and more energy.</v>

857
00:50:27.410 --> 00:50:30.230
<v Speaker 1>An introvert will go to a party and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there'll be there for an hour and</v>

858
00:50:30.231 --> 00:50:33.740
<v Speaker 1>then they've had enough people and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to go home and sit in their room</v>

859
00:50:33.741 --> 00:50:35.840
<v Speaker 1>and recharge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it isn't exactly,</v>

860
00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:38.060
<v Speaker 1>we really don't have any idea why that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

861
00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:41.660
<v Speaker 1>but it seems to be a pretty reliable</v>
<v Speaker 1>marker of the difference between the two</v>

862
00:50:41.661 --> 00:50:42.494
<v Speaker 1>groups.</v>

863
00:50:48.590 --> 00:50:50.820
<v Speaker 1>Here's some what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

864
00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:52.600
<v Speaker 1>let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

865
00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:56.150
<v Speaker 1>Well here's some items so you guys can</v>
<v Speaker 1>do a quick,</v>

866
00:50:56.990 --> 00:51:01.990
<v Speaker 1>big five on yourselves and I'll tell you</v>
<v Speaker 1>the upside and downside of it.</v>

867
00:51:02.121 --> 00:51:05.030
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're orderly,</v>

868
00:51:06.050 --> 00:51:08.690
<v Speaker 1>you follow a schedule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dominique,</v>

869
00:51:08.691 --> 00:51:09.710
<v Speaker 1>view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>follow a schedule.</v>

870
00:51:11.690 --> 00:51:13.340
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now how many of you don't.</v>

871
00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:17.930
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one thing I would recommend is that</v>

872
00:51:17.931 --> 00:51:22.490
<v Speaker 1>you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll tell you why,</v>

873
00:51:22.491 --> 00:51:27.050
<v Speaker 1>like intelligence is a very good</v>
<v Speaker 1>predictor of academic performance</v>

874
00:51:28.670 --> 00:51:30.590
<v Speaker 1>and there's not a lot you can do about</v>
<v Speaker 1>your intelligence.</v>

875
00:51:30.591 --> 00:51:33.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can squander it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's very difficult to improve it.</v>

876
00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:37.250
<v Speaker 1>Conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's a trait too so it's hard to</v>

877
00:51:37.251 --> 00:51:39.230
<v Speaker 1>work on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we know that conscientious people</v>

878
00:51:39.231 --> 00:51:42.980
<v Speaker 1>get better grades and it's reliable and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a powerful effect.</v>

879
00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:47.480
<v Speaker 1>And so if your time use organized than</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you're going to be</v>

880
00:51:47.481 --> 00:51:50.600
<v Speaker 1>successful is very high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things you might think</v>

881
00:51:50.601 --> 00:51:55.601
<v Speaker 1>about is make friends with a calendar</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Google calendar or something like</v>

882
00:51:56.721 --> 00:51:58.310
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I can tell you some tricks about</v>

883
00:51:58.311 --> 00:51:59.920
<v Speaker 1>that because really it is important</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

884
00:51:59.930 --> 00:52:04.220
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not kidding around about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're low in conscientiousness,</v>

885
00:52:04.221 --> 00:52:06.320
<v Speaker 1>it's really going to trip you up as you</v>
<v Speaker 1>walk through life.</v>

886
00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:10.100
<v Speaker 1>There's not very many advantages to it</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I've been able to see.</v>

887
00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:12.740
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not assuming that just because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't follow a schedule,</v>

888
00:52:12.741 --> 00:52:15.980
<v Speaker 1>you're low in conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is one of the items that market,</v>

889
00:52:16.890 --> 00:52:18.800
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only,</v>

890
00:52:18.801 --> 00:52:22.400
<v Speaker 1>the advantage I've seen so far to being</v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscientious is that if you become</v>

891
00:52:22.401 --> 00:52:24.230
<v Speaker 1>unemployed it doesn't bother you as</v>
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

892
00:52:24.830 --> 00:52:27.650
<v Speaker 1>And I mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that actually turns out to matter in</v>

893
00:52:27.651 --> 00:52:28.940
<v Speaker 1>some situations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

894
00:52:28.941 --> 00:52:31.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if a big company has to shed and 50</v>

895
00:52:31.281 --> 00:52:34.770
<v Speaker 1>percent of its employees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the conscientious people are going</v>

896
00:52:34.771 --> 00:52:38.030
<v Speaker 1>to suffer themselves to death for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the unconscientious people,</v>

897
00:52:38.031 --> 00:52:40.190
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to care anyways</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they weren't working anyway.</v>

898
00:52:40.191 --> 00:52:42.140
<v Speaker 1>So it doesn't matter if they have a job</v>
<v Speaker 1>or not.</v>

899
00:52:42.410 --> 00:52:47.120
<v Speaker 1>So here's one way of thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>making use of a schedule.</v>

900
00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:51.440
<v Speaker 1>Often people are afraid of schedules</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they think of them as a trap.</v>

901
00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:53.420
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make a schedule and it's like this</v>

902
00:52:53.421 --> 00:52:55.940
<v Speaker 1>little prison that you have to live</v>
<v Speaker 1>inside and you know,</v>

903
00:52:55.970 --> 00:52:59.210
<v Speaker 1>and all you're doing in your schedule is</v>
<v Speaker 1>putting down things you have to do or</v>

904
00:52:59.211 --> 00:53:00.050
<v Speaker 1>should do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

905
00:53:00.051 --> 00:53:01.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not a lot of fun in that.</v>

906
00:53:01.850 --> 00:53:04.040
<v Speaker 1>And so not only is it a trap or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>prison,</v>

907
00:53:04.041 --> 00:53:09.041
<v Speaker 1>but it's kind of an unpleasant one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a way to work with the schedule in a</v>

908
00:53:09.921 --> 00:53:14.000
<v Speaker 1>lot more sophisticated way is to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

909
00:53:14.690 --> 00:53:18.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to plan the next week say</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you plan it day by day,</v>

910
00:53:18.351 --> 00:53:21.320
<v Speaker 1>but we'll take the week as the unit</v>
<v Speaker 1>level of analysis and think,</v>

911
00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:24.230
<v Speaker 1>well I'd like to plan a week I'd like to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

912
00:53:25.750 --> 00:53:29.670
<v Speaker 1>Then your schedule all of a sudden</v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes a tool for increasing the</v>

913
00:53:29.671 --> 00:53:33.870
<v Speaker 1>quality of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a whole different issue,</v>

914
00:53:34.330 --> 00:53:36.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you might think what,</v>

915
00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:40.140
<v Speaker 1>what's the emotion that you suffer</v>
<v Speaker 1>assuming you suffer one of these</v>

916
00:53:40.141 --> 00:53:43.110
<v Speaker 1>emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have an essay that's due and</v>

917
00:53:43.111 --> 00:53:46.230
<v Speaker 1>you're not doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like would you regard that as a pleasant</v>

918
00:53:47.010 --> 00:53:48.540
<v Speaker 1>emotion or unpleasant?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bullshit.</v>

919
00:53:49.860 --> 00:53:54.390
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So is there anybody who is disagreeing</v>

920
00:53:54.391 --> 00:53:59.370
<v Speaker 1>with a statement that having an essay</v>
<v Speaker 1>due or overdue that you're not doing is</v>

921
00:53:59.371 --> 00:54:01.890
<v Speaker 1>unpleasant?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone agrees with that.</v>

922
00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:04.200
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think you can characterize the</v>

923
00:54:04.201 --> 00:54:07.010
<v Speaker 1>unpleasantness?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what kind of emotion is it?</v>

924
00:54:09.090 --> 00:54:10.170
<v Speaker 1>It's guilt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

925
00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:12.930
<v Speaker 1>Anything else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Frustration,</v>

926
00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:14.040
<v Speaker 1>frustration with what</v>

927
00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:16.680
<v Speaker 4>you feel like a failure.</v>

928
00:54:18.570 --> 00:54:19.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're sort of frustrated with</v>

929
00:54:19.891 --> 00:54:21.090
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

930
00:54:21.091 --> 00:54:22.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to slap right?</v>

931
00:54:22.270 --> 00:54:24.240
<v Speaker 1>Do you think I need a slap?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

932
00:54:24.241 --> 00:54:25.500
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So guilt.</v>

933
00:54:25.501 --> 00:54:28.110
<v Speaker 1>Anything else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anxiety,</v>

934
00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:32.220
<v Speaker 1>restlessness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's kind of an agitation.</v>

935
00:54:32.610 --> 00:54:33.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because your body knows you should</v>

936
00:54:33.961 --> 00:54:36.690
<v Speaker 1>be doing something but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not pointing it in the right</v>

937
00:54:36.691 --> 00:54:37.690
<v Speaker 1>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's</v>

938
00:54:39.230 --> 00:54:42.750
<v Speaker 1>a shame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that a reasonable?</v>

939
00:54:43.350 --> 00:54:43.891
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

940
00:54:43.891 --> 00:54:46.560
<v Speaker 1>So the reason I was asking you about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is because,</v>

941
00:54:46.750 --> 00:54:48.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the negative emotions are</v>

942
00:54:48.931 --> 00:54:52.050
<v Speaker 1>associated with neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some of them seem to be associated</v>

943
00:54:52.051 --> 00:54:54.750
<v Speaker 1>with conscientiousness and</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientious.</v>

944
00:54:54.751 --> 00:54:59.751
<v Speaker 1>Negative emotions seem to be guilt and</v>
<v Speaker 1>shame fundamentally.</v>

945
00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:02.460
<v Speaker 1>And so recent research and really</v>
<v Speaker 1>recent,</v>

946
00:55:02.550 --> 00:55:04.500
<v Speaker 1>I already got this paper like a week</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

947
00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:09.630
<v Speaker 1>I think it's about four months old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seem to indicate that conscientious</v>

948
00:55:09.631 --> 00:55:12.300
<v Speaker 1>people feel less guilt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're more guilt prone.</v>

949
00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:16.530
<v Speaker 1>So if they don't do something that makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>them guilty,</v>

950
00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:19.950
<v Speaker 1>but they organize their time so they are</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing the things they're supposed to do</v>

951
00:55:19.951 --> 00:55:21.270
<v Speaker 1>so then they don't feel guilty.</v>

952
00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:23.880
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to the schedule.</v>

953
00:55:23.881 --> 00:55:24.714
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

954
00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:27.630
<v Speaker 1>you think about your week and you think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about your day and you think,</v>

955
00:55:27.631 --> 00:55:29.790
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would you improve the quality of a</v>

956
00:55:29.791 --> 00:55:31.770
<v Speaker 1>given day or given week?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

957
00:55:31.771 --> 00:55:35.310
<v Speaker 1>one of the ways of improving it is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>not put yourself into the situation</v>

958
00:55:35.311 --> 00:55:38.640
<v Speaker 1>where there are things hanging over your</v>
<v Speaker 1>head that you have to feel guilty and</v>

959
00:55:38.641 --> 00:55:41.770
<v Speaker 1>ashamed about because that's a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>unpleasant way of being.</v>

960
00:55:41.771 --> 00:55:43.650
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have an essay,</v>

961
00:55:44.180 --> 00:55:47.730
<v Speaker 1>it's due in a week and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>procrastinating,</v>

962
00:55:48.540 --> 00:55:52.080
<v Speaker 1>then the fact that you have to do that</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it can ruin the whole week.</v>

963
00:55:52.260 --> 00:55:56.490
<v Speaker 1>And even when you're doing something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's positive hypothetically,</v>

964
00:55:56.730 --> 00:55:59.850
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of that horrible kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive that you experienced when you</v>

965
00:55:59.851 --> 00:56:01.410
<v Speaker 1>know that you should be doing something</v>
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

966
00:56:01.411 --> 00:56:04.800
<v Speaker 1>And so that's when you ended up watching</v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube videos about like dancing cats</v>

967
00:56:04.801 --> 00:56:05.640
<v Speaker 1>or something like that.</v>

968
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:06.730
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

969
00:56:06.730 --> 00:56:08.190
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's at best.</v>

970
00:56:08.191 --> 00:56:10.810
<v Speaker 1>It's a guilty pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a pleasure at all.</v>

971
00:56:10.811 --> 00:56:12.240
<v Speaker 1>You think like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell am I doing?</v>

972
00:56:12.241 --> 00:56:14.200
<v Speaker 1>Watching videos of dancing cats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

973
00:56:14.370 --> 00:56:17.190
<v Speaker 1>but then you know that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>procrastinating and that's low quality,</v>

974
00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:20.880
<v Speaker 1>very low quality existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you use your schedule,</v>

975
00:56:20.881 --> 00:56:21.720
<v Speaker 1>you can think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

976
00:56:21.721 --> 00:56:24.400
<v Speaker 1>well here's some times that I'm going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do this work,</v>

977
00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:28.990
<v Speaker 1>and then you can also sort of ask</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself about that when you're</v>

978
00:56:28.991 --> 00:56:32.410
<v Speaker 1>designing your schedule because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to design a schedule like</v>

979
00:56:32.411 --> 00:56:34.540
<v Speaker 1>your Adolf Hitler telling yourself what</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do,</v>

980
00:56:34.541 --> 00:56:37.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're not going to comply with</v>

981
00:56:37.361 --> 00:56:39.400
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then what you have to do if you're going</v>

982
00:56:39.401 --> 00:56:41.500
<v Speaker 1>to design a schedule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have to ask yourself,</v>

983
00:56:42.100 --> 00:56:43.840
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to set aside some time to</v>

984
00:56:43.841 --> 00:56:46.510
<v Speaker 1>study over the next week or two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do this essay or whatever it is.</v>

985
00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:49.090
<v Speaker 1>How much time would I actually spend</v>
<v Speaker 1>studying?</v>

986
00:56:49.750 --> 00:56:51.520
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go to the library for four</v>

987
00:56:51.521 --> 00:56:53.020
<v Speaker 1>hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

988
00:56:53.380 --> 00:56:55.570
<v Speaker 1>how many of you go to the library for</v>
<v Speaker 1>four hours a day?</v>

989
00:56:57.230 --> 00:56:59.390
<v Speaker 1>You do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much work do you do during those</v>

990
00:56:59.391 --> 00:57:01.400
<v Speaker 1>four hours?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do?</v>

991
00:57:01.401 --> 00:57:03.740
<v Speaker 1>That's very impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it more than four hours?</v>

992
00:57:06.420 --> 00:57:09.150
<v Speaker 1>And so what proportion of the time</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're spending there do you think is</v>

993
00:57:09.151 --> 00:57:10.080
<v Speaker 1>actually efficient?</v>

994
00:57:12.260 --> 00:57:13.093
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

995
00:57:13.130 --> 00:57:14.240
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>

996
00:57:14.270 --> 00:57:16.310
<v Speaker 1>My suspicions are that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientious.</v>

997
00:57:16.760 --> 00:57:18.770
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's exceptional.</v>

998
00:57:18.771 --> 00:57:20.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean people usually don't manage that</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

999
00:57:20.930 --> 00:57:23.900
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an hour or two a day might be a</v>

1000
00:57:23.901 --> 00:57:27.770
<v Speaker 1>worthwhile thing to schedule it and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>would say don't schedule in more than</v>

1001
00:57:27.770 --> 00:57:32.060
<v Speaker 1>that to begin with because then you'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>fail and then you'll stop using the</v>

1002
00:57:32.061 --> 00:57:34.370
<v Speaker 1>schedule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the other thing you want to do is</v>

1003
00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:37.520
<v Speaker 1>you want to schedule and things that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to do and then you want to look at</v>

1004
00:57:37.521 --> 00:57:39.680
<v Speaker 1>the day or the week and you think you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to think,</v>

1005
00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:42.980
<v Speaker 1>hey that's a week I'd like to have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I had a week like that,</v>

1006
00:57:42.981 --> 00:57:43.820
<v Speaker 1>it would be good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1007
00:57:43.821 --> 00:57:46.790
<v Speaker 1>I'd be caught up so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that all that negative emotion</v>

1008
00:57:46.791 --> 00:57:49.430
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have to accrue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to down a bunch of things</v>

1009
00:57:49.431 --> 00:57:52.670
<v Speaker 1>that I'm interested in doing and at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>end of the week I'd be in better shape</v>

1010
00:57:52.671 --> 00:57:56.990
<v Speaker 1>than I was at the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you treat a schedule like that so</v>

1011
00:57:56.991 --> 00:58:01.070
<v Speaker 1>that what you're using it is to design</v>
<v Speaker 1>the days and weeks that you want to have</v>

1012
00:58:01.310 --> 00:58:03.000
<v Speaker 1>instead of using it as this little you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1013
00:58:03.380 --> 00:58:06.140
<v Speaker 1>jail that you have to put yourself in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're not going to do anyways,</v>

1014
00:58:06.440 --> 00:58:10.100
<v Speaker 1>then you can learn to use them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's one thing you could do to</v>

1015
00:58:10.101 --> 00:58:12.600
<v Speaker 1>make yourself more industrious or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

1016
00:58:12.830 --> 00:58:13.663
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1017
00:58:14.060 --> 00:58:18.950
<v Speaker 1>more conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more conscientious follow a schedule am</v>

1018
00:58:18.951 --> 00:58:22.130
<v Speaker 1>not bothered by disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how many of you people are not</v>

1019
00:58:22.131 --> 00:58:23.240
<v Speaker 1>bothered by disorder?</v>

1020
00:58:26.060 --> 00:58:27.800
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how many of you are bothered by</v>

1021
00:58:27.801 --> 00:58:29.600
<v Speaker 1>disorder?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1022
00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:33.350
<v Speaker 1>So some of those of you who are bothered</v>
<v Speaker 1>by disorder probably have an eating</v>

1023
00:58:33.351 --> 00:58:34.880
<v Speaker 1>disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be my guess.</v>

1024
00:58:34.881 --> 00:58:37.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that would be my guess because one</v>

1025
00:58:37.401 --> 00:58:39.440
<v Speaker 1>of the things that does characterize</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are,</v>

1026
00:58:39.830 --> 00:58:42.880
<v Speaker 1>who have eating disorders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tend to be very orderly and</v>

1027
00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:44.840
<v Speaker 1>orderly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People tend to be quite sensitive to</v>

1028
00:58:44.841 --> 00:58:48.620
<v Speaker 1>discussed and discussed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seems to be the driving factor behind</v>

1029
00:58:48.621 --> 00:58:53.000
<v Speaker 1>eating disorders because people who have</v>
<v Speaker 1>body dysmorphia or eating disorders tend</v>

1030
00:58:53.001 --> 00:58:55.690
<v Speaker 1>to be relatively disgusted by what they</v>
<v Speaker 1>see as you know,</v>

1031
00:58:55.730 --> 00:59:00.730
<v Speaker 1>inadequacies in their own body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so orderliness can get out of hand a</v>

1032
00:59:01.851 --> 00:59:04.880
<v Speaker 1>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have some suspicions that it's maybe</v>

1033
00:59:04.881 --> 00:59:09.110
<v Speaker 1>also associated with authoritarianism in</v>
<v Speaker 1>political viewpoints because</v>

1034
00:59:09.111 --> 00:59:11.870
<v Speaker 1>conservatives are more conscientious</v>
<v Speaker 1>than liberals,</v>

1035
00:59:11.871 --> 00:59:14.450
<v Speaker 1>but it's specifically they tend to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>more orderly.</v>

1036
00:59:14.750 --> 00:59:17.060
<v Speaker 1>So under that doesn't mean orderliness</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a bad thing.</v>

1037
00:59:17.061 --> 00:59:19.310
<v Speaker 1>It just means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is something to think about</v>

1038
00:59:19.311 --> 00:59:24.311
<v Speaker 1>with regards to all the traits that any</v>
<v Speaker 1>trade exaggerated too far starts to</v>

1039
00:59:24.411 --> 00:59:27.890
<v Speaker 1>become negative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the big five traits,</v>

1040
00:59:28.940 --> 00:59:32.810
<v Speaker 1>at least in principle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have any,</v>

1041
00:59:34.550 --> 00:59:36.980
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Intrinsic moral value.</v>

1042
00:59:39.860 --> 00:59:44.570
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly because too much of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>good thing seems to turn very rapidly</v>

1043
00:59:44.571 --> 00:59:49.430
<v Speaker 1>into a really bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So having a healthy personality seems to</v>

1044
00:59:49.431 --> 00:59:53.570
<v Speaker 1>be more like something like the balance</v>
<v Speaker 1>between the different traits and maybe</v>

1045
00:59:53.571 --> 00:59:58.130
<v Speaker 1>also something like your ability to</v>
<v Speaker 1>increase the breadth of your traits.</v>

1046
00:59:58.370 --> 01:00:00.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so maybe if you're hyper orderly,</v>

1047
01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:05.180
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that would be good for</v>
<v Speaker 1>you to learn is to not be hyper orderly</v>

1048
01:00:05.181 --> 01:00:08.000
<v Speaker 1>in every situation all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's too rigid.</v>

1049
01:00:08.570 --> 01:00:12.020
<v Speaker 1>So okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so orderly people are bothered by</v>

1050
01:00:12.021 --> 01:00:17.021
<v Speaker 1>disorder and they follow a schedule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so a industrious people</v>

1051
01:00:19.550 --> 01:00:21.620
<v Speaker 1>do not waste their time and they know</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're doing.</v>

1052
01:00:21.770 --> 01:00:26.770
<v Speaker 1>So how many of you people</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't waste your time?</v>

1053
01:00:32.780 --> 01:00:36.590
<v Speaker 1>So two people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1054
01:00:37.210 --> 01:00:38.110
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've played it.</v>

1055
01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:41.480
<v Speaker 1>How much time do you waste with you</v>
<v Speaker 1>before I have?</v>

1056
01:00:41.481 --> 01:00:43.490
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's too bad because I love torturing</v>

1057
01:00:43.491 --> 01:00:46.400
<v Speaker 1>undergraduates at that game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1058
01:00:46.430 --> 01:00:49.370
<v Speaker 1>So that's another advantage to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>schedule,</v>

1059
01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:50.233
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it can,</v>

1060
01:00:50.390 --> 01:00:52.280
<v Speaker 1>it can really help you with time</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasting.</v>

1061
01:00:52.281 --> 01:00:55.580
<v Speaker 1>And that's something that'll kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kill you over time.</v>

1062
01:00:56.090 --> 01:01:00.440
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many of you have good goals and you</v>

1063
01:01:00.441 --> 01:01:01.670
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and know what you're doing.</v>

1064
01:01:04.330 --> 01:01:05.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's better.</v>

1065
01:01:05.291 --> 01:01:08.080
<v Speaker 1>How many of you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of you don't know really what</v>

1066
01:01:08.081 --> 01:01:10.270
<v Speaker 1>you're doing or where you're going?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1067
01:01:10.420 --> 01:01:11.710
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1068
01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:14.400
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's conscientiousness,</v>

1069
01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:19.540
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>volatile.</v>

1070
01:01:19.541 --> 01:01:23.290
<v Speaker 1>People get angry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>easy and they don't keep their emotions</v>

1071
01:01:23.291 --> 01:01:25.600
<v Speaker 1>under control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What that should have been reversed by</v>

1072
01:01:25.601 --> 01:01:30.601
<v Speaker 1>the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm withdrawal seldom feel blue.</v>

1073
01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:33.820
<v Speaker 1>It's the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm filled with or sorry,</v>

1074
01:01:33.821 --> 01:01:35.680
<v Speaker 1>sell them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Feel blue is at the opposite,</v>

1075
01:01:35.740 --> 01:01:39.730
<v Speaker 1>am filled with doubts about things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's seems like more of a depression</v>

1076
01:01:40.570 --> 01:01:41.650
<v Speaker 1>trait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Withdrawal,</v>

1077
01:01:42.730 --> 01:01:47.470
<v Speaker 1>so that's a negative emotion dimension,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so people reliably differ on the degree</v>

1078
01:01:47.471 --> 01:01:50.410
<v Speaker 1>to which the experience negative emotion</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the degree to which they experienced</v>

1079
01:01:50.411 --> 01:01:54.190
<v Speaker 1>positive emotion and those two things</v>
<v Speaker 1>are actually different because the</v>

1080
01:01:54.191 --> 01:01:58.630
<v Speaker 1>circuitry that operates positive emotion</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a particular circuit and the circuits</v>

1081
01:01:58.631 --> 01:02:01.420
<v Speaker 1>that operate negative emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our particular circuits,</v>

1082
01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:06.600
<v Speaker 1>and they're not merely opposites so you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be highly neurotic and very</v>

1083
01:02:07.001 --> 01:02:10.000
<v Speaker 1>extroverted and so that means you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>always at parties,</v>

1084
01:02:10.001 --> 01:02:12.280
<v Speaker 1>but you're continually worrying what</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are thinking of you.</v>

1085
01:02:13.060 --> 01:02:15.850
<v Speaker 1>So it's people like that are actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite complicated.</v>

1086
01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:16.760
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>

1087
01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:18.070
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a complicated</v>

1088
01:02:20.450 --> 01:02:24.020
<v Speaker 1>combination of traits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Agreeableness,</v>

1089
01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:26.270
<v Speaker 1>polite people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>respect authority,</v>

1090
01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:29.060
<v Speaker 1>and they do not believe that they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>better than others.</v>

1091
01:02:30.250 --> 01:02:33.770
<v Speaker 1>And Compassionate people are interested</v>
<v Speaker 1>in other people's problems and take time</v>

1092
01:02:33.771 --> 01:02:35.960
<v Speaker 1>for other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1093
01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:43.020
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you this after we do it at</v>
<v Speaker 1>extroversion,</v>

1094
01:02:43.290 --> 01:02:45.090
<v Speaker 1>open people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We talked about this already,</v>

1095
01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:47.220
<v Speaker 1>if you're creative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you believe in the importance of art,</v>

1096
01:02:47.250 --> 01:02:50.820
<v Speaker 1>you love to reflect on things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're smart,</v>

1097
01:02:50.850 --> 01:02:54.510
<v Speaker 1>which is sort of the intellect category,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're quick to understand things and</v>

1098
01:02:54.511 --> 01:02:58.800
<v Speaker 1>can handle a lot of information and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>extroverted people are assertive,</v>

1099
01:02:59.310 --> 01:03:02.280
<v Speaker 1>they take charge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're able to influence people,</v>

1100
01:03:02.310 --> 01:03:05.970
<v Speaker 1>so they're kind of charismatic and if</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're enthusiastic,</v>

1101
01:03:06.300 --> 01:03:09.450
<v Speaker 1>they make friends easily and are easy to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get to know</v>

1102
01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:15.330
<v Speaker 1>it might be of some interest to you that</v>
<v Speaker 1>disagreeable</v>

1103
01:03:16.830 --> 01:03:17.663
<v Speaker 3>people</v>

1104
01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:23.960
<v Speaker 1>who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>extroverted are narcissistic.</v>

1105
01:03:25.890 --> 01:03:30.780
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>because a disagreeable person doesn't,</v>

1106
01:03:32.090 --> 01:03:34.800
<v Speaker 1>isn't particularly applied,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't really care about your</v>

1107
01:03:34.801 --> 01:03:38.310
<v Speaker 1>feelings and they're very dominant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So and uh,</v>

1108
01:03:42.810 --> 01:03:47.810
<v Speaker 1>so if you're like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be useful to learn when to be</v>

1109
01:03:51.850 --> 01:03:55.810
<v Speaker 1>quieter and social situations and how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>attend more to other people.</v>

1110
01:03:56.350 --> 01:04:00.310
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that seems quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>useful for people who are disagreeable</v>

1111
01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:05.940
<v Speaker 1>and narcissistic for that matter is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>try consciously on a regular basis to do</v>

1112
01:04:06.911 --> 01:04:10.120
<v Speaker 1>something for someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also actually seems to make people</v>

1113
01:04:10.121 --> 01:04:14.020
<v Speaker 1>who are narcissistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>happier to do that.</v>

1114
01:04:14.620 --> 01:04:19.620
<v Speaker 1>Interestingly enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1115
01:04:26.961 --> 01:04:31.961
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just briefly also talk about</v>

1116
01:04:33.030 --> 01:04:38.030
<v Speaker 1>general cognitive ability is sort of an.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Excuse me,</v>

1117
01:04:38.481 --> 01:04:41.150
<v Speaker 1>it's an overview of where we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>head over the next few courses.</v>

1118
01:04:41.940 --> 01:04:44.030
<v Speaker 1>This is a Raven's progressive matrices</v>
<v Speaker 1>test.</v>

1119
01:04:44.330 --> 01:04:46.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't think this one is very</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult,</v>

1120
01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:49.010
<v Speaker 1>although I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to look at it before.</v>

1121
01:04:49.011 --> 01:04:52.280
<v Speaker 1>I certainly tell you that because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want you to feel bad.</v>

1122
01:04:55.620 --> 01:04:56.830
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the answer is there anyway.</v>

1123
01:04:56.840 --> 01:04:59.060
<v Speaker 1>So it actually turns out to be extremely</v>
<v Speaker 1>easy.</v>

1124
01:05:00.620 --> 01:05:02.570
<v Speaker 1>So why is seven the right answer?</v>

1125
01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:04.890
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

1126
01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:12.700
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say that again.</v>

1127
01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:14.870
<v Speaker 1>It has to be the lowest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1128
01:05:15.490 --> 01:05:20.290
<v Speaker 1>Why does it have to be the lowest?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the squares at the top.</v>

1129
01:05:21.130 --> 01:05:22.290
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there has to be in,</v>

1130
01:05:22.330 --> 01:05:24.590
<v Speaker 1>there has to be an item at the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1131
01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:29.080
<v Speaker 1>And be a little circle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it has to be trying have to be a</v>

1132
01:05:29.081 --> 01:05:32.290
<v Speaker 1>triangle because it's the only thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>missing,</v>

1133
01:05:32.980 --> 01:05:34.820
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because every other rowers triangle.</v>

1134
01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:38.140
<v Speaker 1>So you inferred all that by analyzing</v>
<v Speaker 1>the three by three matrix.</v>

1135
01:05:38.460 --> 01:05:41.430
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The faster you can do that</v>

1136
01:05:42.340 --> 01:05:43.173
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

1137
01:05:45.090 --> 01:05:47.340
<v Speaker 1>it's an interaction between speed and</v>
<v Speaker 1>complexity.</v>

1138
01:05:47.341 --> 01:05:49.830
<v Speaker 1>You could make these questions much more</v>
<v Speaker 1>complex than this one.</v>

1139
01:05:49.831 --> 01:05:50.431
<v Speaker 1>This one's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1140
01:05:50.431 --> 01:05:53.430
<v Speaker 1>reasonably complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they can get really vicious because</v>

1141
01:05:53.431 --> 01:05:56.910
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two dimensions of variation here.</v>

1142
01:05:56.960 --> 01:06:01.410
<v Speaker 1>There's whether or not it's an oval,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a triangle,</v>

1143
01:06:01.470 --> 01:06:04.860
<v Speaker 1>and a rectangle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then where the thing is,</v>

1144
01:06:04.980 --> 01:06:07.140
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you could imagine you could make a</v>

1145
01:06:07.141 --> 01:06:09.540
<v Speaker 1>matrix with like four dimensions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>variability.</v>

1146
01:06:09.930 --> 01:06:14.930
<v Speaker 1>And so these tests turn out to be the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most accurate tests of general cognitive</v>

1147
01:06:17.281 --> 01:06:19.200
<v Speaker 1>ability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Raven's progressive matrices.</v>

1148
01:06:19.201 --> 01:06:22.170
<v Speaker 1>That's not verbal intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's nonverbal intelligence.</v>

1149
01:06:22.710 --> 01:06:23.490
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1150
01:06:23.490 --> 01:06:27.600
<v Speaker 1>and I can tell you why it is that these</v>
<v Speaker 1>tests turned out to be that way later.</v>

1151
01:06:28.110 --> 01:06:33.030
<v Speaker 1>And I will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>General cognitive ability is a very good</v>

1152
01:06:33.031 --> 01:06:38.031
<v Speaker 1>predictor of life success and it seems</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be very much biologically.</v>

1153
01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:40.193
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1154
01:06:42.530 --> 01:06:47.090
<v Speaker 1>what would you say biological factors</v>
<v Speaker 1>play a large role,</v>

1155
01:06:47.150 --> 01:06:50.360
<v Speaker 1>especially in modern society and</v>
<v Speaker 1>determining relative levels of</v>

1156
01:06:50.361 --> 01:06:53.000
<v Speaker 1>intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a relatively rough.</v>

1157
01:06:55.790 --> 01:06:58.250
<v Speaker 1>It's a rough fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1158
01:06:58.310 --> 01:07:03.310
<v Speaker 1>So we'll sum up briefly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like there's five basic</v>

1159
01:07:05.331 --> 01:07:10.070
<v Speaker 1>dimensions of variability</v>
<v Speaker 1>that characterize the human personality,</v>

1160
01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:14.570
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional stability,</v>

1161
01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:18.680
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>openness and extroversion.</v>

1162
01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:22.280
<v Speaker 1>And what we'll do as we progress through</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the,</v>

1163
01:07:22.330 --> 01:07:25.910
<v Speaker 1>or at least the next,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly a little more than a third of</v>

1164
01:07:25.911 --> 01:07:30.380
<v Speaker 1>the classes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will delineate each of these variables,</v>

1165
01:07:30.390 --> 01:07:32.360
<v Speaker 1>try to understand precisely what they</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean,</v>

1166
01:07:32.540 --> 01:07:37.130
<v Speaker 1>see if we can analyze their effect on</v>
<v Speaker 1>society and maybe also provide you with</v>

1167
01:07:37.131 --> 01:07:41.120
<v Speaker 1>the opportunity to get some more insight</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the personality traits that you</v>

1168
01:07:41.121 --> 01:07:42.830
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The exercise,</v>

1169
01:07:42.831 --> 01:07:44.450
<v Speaker 1>the personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>self analysis,</v>

1170
01:07:44.451 --> 01:07:48.590
<v Speaker 1>the adjectives that were in there were</v>
<v Speaker 1>taken from the big five models.</v>

1171
01:07:48.591 --> 01:07:49.610
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1172
01:07:49.611 --> 01:07:53.150
<v Speaker 1>that sort of gave you an opportunity to</v>
<v Speaker 1>assess yourself roughly on a big,</v>

1173
01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:57.260
<v Speaker 1>on the big five dimensions and see what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could do to improve.</v>

1174
01:07:58.070 --> 01:07:59.810
<v Speaker 1>So we'll see you on Thursday.</v>
