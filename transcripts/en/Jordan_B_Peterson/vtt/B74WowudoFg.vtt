1
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.260
<v Speaker 1>Last time we spoke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was not so long ago,</v>

2
00:00:17.261 --> 00:00:18.094
<v Speaker 1>but</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've been in the headlights even more </v>

3
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.400
<v Speaker 1>since the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since the release of the book and uh,</v>

4
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.413
<v Speaker 1>and also the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a beautiful interview with Katherine </v>

5
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.340
<v Speaker 1>Newman.</v>

6
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.173
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that seemed to start a whole new </v>

7
00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:37.800
<v Speaker 2>plateau,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

8
00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.930
<v Speaker 2>of interest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

9
00:00:39.931 --> 00:00:40.764
<v Speaker 2>And I thought that yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been in the headlines a lot and </v>

10
00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.330
<v Speaker 2>rather an settling amount I would say.</v>

11
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.473
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't want to dwell on the cat </v>

12
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.620
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human interview too much because,</v>

13
00:00:57.621 --> 00:00:58.141
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've,</v>

14
00:00:58.141 --> 00:00:59.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've been,</v>

15
00:00:59.501 --> 00:01:01.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>made to talk so much about it,</v>

16
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.990
<v Speaker 1>but I think you're probably tired about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

17
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:09.020
<v Speaker 1>but just one thing that I think you </v>
<v Speaker 1>demonstrated very clearly,</v>

18
00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about yourself and also about,</v>

19
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.913
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying that patience is a virtue that </v>

20
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.340
<v Speaker 1>you actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the end you want out,</v>

21
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.913
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you stayed calm and you </v>

22
00:01:24.511 --> 00:01:25.344
<v Speaker 1>explained what you actually meant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in the end she liked words and I </v>

23
00:01:30.901 --> 00:01:35.700
<v Speaker 1>think that actually was an inspiring </v>
<v Speaker 1>example to a lot of people.</v>

24
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems to have been in,</v>

25
00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.200
<v Speaker 2>although it isn't clear why was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It isn't,</v>

26
00:01:41.201 --> 00:01:46.180
<v Speaker 2>still isn't really clear to me why it </v>
<v Speaker 2>became so incredibly widespread.</v>

27
00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.043
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the interview itself on Youtube </v>

28
00:01:50.081 --> 00:01:52.810
<v Speaker 2>as something approximating 8 million </v>
<v Speaker 2>views,</v>

29
00:01:52.811 --> 00:01:53.644
<v Speaker 2>but if you add the commentaries to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lots of people have cut it up and </v>

30
00:01:57.941 --> 00:01:59.440
<v Speaker 2>commented on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>

31
00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.963
<v Speaker 2>I suspect it exceeds 20 million and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there was something about the interview </v>

32
00:02:04.661 --> 00:02:07.180
<v Speaker 2>that really attracted a tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of attention.</v>

33
00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:08.613
<v Speaker 2>So it's very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's obviously part and parcel of the </v>

34
00:02:11.861 --> 00:02:12.694
<v Speaker 2>political tension that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's odd that it seems to underlie </v>

35
00:02:15.491 --> 00:02:17.080
<v Speaker 2>virtually everything right now.</v>

36
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.700
<v Speaker 1>I think it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the platonic ideal states,</v>

37
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:28.663
<v Speaker 1>like this is the interview that </v>
<v Speaker 1>illustrates the cultural world where </v>

38
00:02:32.841 --> 00:02:36.710
<v Speaker 1>everything that's wrong about not taking</v>
<v Speaker 1>your opponents seriously,</v>

39
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can always show that interview.</v>

40
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.313
<v Speaker 1>So it's a great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a great way to just introduce people to </v>

41
00:02:45.651 --> 00:02:47.480
<v Speaker 1>what's wrong with the political </v>
<v Speaker 1>discourse.</v>

42
00:02:47.481 --> 00:02:48.010
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

43
00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.870
<v Speaker 2>I have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a hypothesis to run by you.</v>

44
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.290
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so imagine what's happening.</v>

45
00:02:54.291 --> 00:02:55.124
<v Speaker 2>Is this the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're in the midst of a technological </v>

46
00:02:58.431 --> 00:02:59.264
<v Speaker 2>transformation and the online video </v>
<v Speaker 2>services are displacing network and </v>

47
00:03:05.231 --> 00:03:06.064
<v Speaker 2>cable television.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the online print services are </v>

48
00:03:09.191 --> 00:03:12.730
<v Speaker 2>displacing the traditional print media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's say that,</v>

49
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.780
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's increasing desperation on the</v>

50
00:03:16.781 --> 00:03:17.614
<v Speaker 2>part of the traditional media and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>then let's say that as a consequence of </v>

51
00:03:21.251 --> 00:03:24.870
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that did that additional nervousness and</v>

52
00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:26.400
<v Speaker 2>instability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

53
00:03:26.401 --> 00:03:27.234
<v Speaker 2>many people are leaving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>second budgets are being cut and third </v>

54
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.230
<v Speaker 2>there's increasing desperation for to </v>
<v Speaker 2>hold on to market share.</v>

55
00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:37.463
<v Speaker 2>And as a consequence of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more and more articles are polarized </v>

56
00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:42.683
<v Speaker 2>because they attract more attention and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's driving the political </v>

57
00:03:46.171 --> 00:03:49.500
<v Speaker 2>polarization in part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that seem reasonable to you?</v>

58
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.570
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do think that seems reasonable.</v>

59
00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:56.820
<v Speaker 1>And I do think</v>

60
00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.233
<v Speaker 2>you also have a greater need for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>established media to debunk a sort of </v>

61
00:04:06.481 --> 00:04:10.360
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people who are popular on Youtube or</v>

62
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:11.620
<v Speaker 2>podcasts</v>

63
00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:13.450
<v Speaker 1>free free from</v>

64
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:15.990
<v Speaker 2>the big thing.</v>

65
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also some of the TV channels.</v>

66
00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.113
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you think it's also direct </v>

67
00:04:20.951 --> 00:04:22.840
<v Speaker 2>competition?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

68
00:04:22.841 --> 00:04:25.360
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not sure if it's</v>

69
00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.670
<v Speaker 1>a sort of a conscious effort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think also it's incompetent</v>

70
00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.100
<v Speaker 2>sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You never,</v>

71
00:04:32.101 --> 00:04:36.120
<v Speaker 2>never underestimate everything together </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a</v>

72
00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.620
<v Speaker 2>life extremism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>populism,</v>

73
00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.610
<v Speaker 2>and they have a very hard time </v>
<v Speaker 2>discerning what sort of</v>

74
00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.830
<v Speaker 1>the real Nazis from just people</v>

75
00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.860
<v Speaker 2>having legitimate ideas and legitimate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's another issue,</v>

76
00:04:57.791 --> 00:04:58.624
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that it's in the radical left </v>

77
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.720
<v Speaker 2>interest to lump everyone who opposes </v>
<v Speaker 2>their ideological attempts into a single</v>

78
00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:11.253
<v Speaker 2>terrifying category because if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they had to contend with the fact </v>

79
00:05:15.641 --> 00:05:16.474
<v Speaker 2>that you can be reasonable centrist or </v>
<v Speaker 2>even reasonable center leftist and </v>

80
00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.660
<v Speaker 2>dispute the validity of identity </v>
<v Speaker 2>politics as a framework for conducting a</v>

81
00:05:25.661 --> 00:05:26.494
<v Speaker 2>political discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have to accept that reasonable </v>

82
00:05:28.931 --> 00:05:29.764
<v Speaker 2>people can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you have to accept that reasonable </v>

83
00:05:31.421 --> 00:05:32.254
<v Speaker 2>people can object to your ideology and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that implies that your ideology isn't </v>

84
00:05:36.071 --> 00:05:36.904
<v Speaker 2>reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's every reason for people on </v>

85
00:05:40.181 --> 00:05:45.181
<v Speaker 2>the radical left to not only assume that</v>
<v Speaker 2>their opponents are reprehensible,</v>

86
00:05:47.471 --> 00:05:48.304
<v Speaker 2>but to make the case that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>reprehensible without ever bothering to </v>

87
00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:55.120
<v Speaker 2>scratch below the surface.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think that's happening too.</v>

88
00:05:55.121 --> 00:05:55.954
<v Speaker 2>And then of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never wanted to let the university's </v>

89
00:05:58.161 --> 00:05:58.994
<v Speaker 2>off the hook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think the fact that the </v>

90
00:06:01.341 --> 00:06:02.174
<v Speaker 2>universities have allowed and encouraged</v>
<v Speaker 2>the growth of radical leftist ideology </v>

91
00:06:07.011 --> 00:06:07.844
<v Speaker 2>in the humanities and the social </v>
<v Speaker 2>sciences is absolutely completely </v>

92
00:06:11.481 --> 00:06:12.314
<v Speaker 2>inexcusable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I might even prove fatal to the </v>

93
00:06:14.811 --> 00:06:18.710
<v Speaker 2>universities we'll see about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it wouldn't surprise me.</v>

94
00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.470
<v Speaker 2>Universities have been around a long </v>
<v Speaker 2>time though.</v>

95
00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:24.653
<v Speaker 1>Last we spoke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was doing a piece on how radical </v>

96
00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:35.120
<v Speaker 1>feminism had been mandatory for a course</v>
<v Speaker 1>at Lund University.</v>

97
00:06:35.641 --> 00:06:36.474
<v Speaker 1>And we spoke about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The professor was a mandated to include </v>

98
00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:44.313
<v Speaker 1>you in this course and I continued</v>
<v Speaker 1>writing about the universities and it </v>

99
00:06:53.861 --> 00:06:57.760
<v Speaker 1>goes much deeper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It goes even if you look at the grants,</v>

100
00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.620
<v Speaker 1>if you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have 10,</v>

101
00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:05.750
<v Speaker 1>10 billion kroners which are being </v>
<v Speaker 1>distributed from the state and uh,</v>

102
00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.160
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are the,</v>

103
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:09.063
<v Speaker 1>the gender mainstreaming that's taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>place in the university universities </v>

104
00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:17.070
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to courses and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

105
00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:22.560
<v Speaker 1>the reading lists and the professors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also when it comes to the grants.</v>

106
00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:23.883
<v Speaker 1>So you have to include a gender </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective or at least you have to </v>

107
00:07:27.131 --> 00:07:30.340
<v Speaker 1>specify why you don't have a gender </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

108
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:32.420
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is probably fatal.</v>

109
00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:34.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

110
00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.073
<v Speaker 1>So one of my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a friend of mine that I got to know him </v>

111
00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:39.573
<v Speaker 1>via his dog because I have a dog and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>our dogs became friends and then we </v>

112
00:07:42.851 --> 00:07:47.851
<v Speaker 1>became friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he made his phd about trouts and wild</v>

113
00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.860
<v Speaker 1>and wild trout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

114
00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:54.250
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you say</v>

115
00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.930
<v Speaker 1>a domestic trunks?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

116
00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:00.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

117
00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:03.060
<v Speaker 1>So the difference in behavior sounds </v>
<v Speaker 1>very boring,</v>

118
00:08:03.061 --> 00:08:05.370
<v Speaker 1>but it's actually kind of interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>when</v>

119
00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:07.823
<v Speaker 1>he was about to not get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not get a grant because he didn't think </v>

120
00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:11.600
<v Speaker 1>religion perspective.</v>

121
00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:13.790
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

122
00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:14.970
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know now</v>

123
00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:18.630
<v Speaker 1>10 years ago and now it's spreading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm,</v>

124
00:08:18.631 --> 00:08:21.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting a lot of stories about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's crazy.</v>

125
00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:22.713
<v Speaker 1>The universities or really it's shifted </v>
<v Speaker 1>into second gear here in Sweden with </v>

126
00:08:28.021 --> 00:08:28.350
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

127
00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:29.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the same.</v>

128
00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:32.010
<v Speaker 2>It's happening everywhere in the west,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say.</v>

129
00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:34.050
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>

130
00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:37.140
<v Speaker 2>our government just handed down a budget</v>
<v Speaker 2>and every,</v>

131
00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:38.213
<v Speaker 2>as far as I can tell from the initial </v>
<v Speaker 2>response and every government program </v>

132
00:08:44.011 --> 00:08:47.280
<v Speaker 2>has to include a gender perspective now </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the same manner.</v>

133
00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:51.450
<v Speaker 2>And so our government is deciding to </v>
<v Speaker 2>solve a problem that doesn't exist.</v>

134
00:08:51.451 --> 00:08:52.284
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's happened is that we've accepted </v>

135
00:08:53.401 --> 00:08:54.234
<v Speaker 2>equity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've accepted equality outcome as the </v>

136
00:08:56.041 --> 00:08:59.100
<v Speaker 2>measure by which we're going to judge </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fairness of,</v>

137
00:08:59.101 --> 00:09:00.490
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>organizations,</v>

138
00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:02.483
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>operations at the same time when the </v>

139
00:09:04.591 --> 00:09:09.300
<v Speaker 2>social science research is stacking up </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the other side of the distribution to</v>

140
00:09:09.301 --> 00:09:14.301
<v Speaker 2>state ever more clearly and with ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>more with ever less doubt that as you,</v>

141
00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.153
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you flatten out the sociological </v>

142
00:09:20.481 --> 00:09:23.210
<v Speaker 2>landscape so that men and women are </v>
<v Speaker 2>treated more equally,</v>

143
00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:27.130
<v Speaker 2>that the difference in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>occupational choices widens,</v>

144
00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:29.660
<v Speaker 2>become crystal clear.</v>

145
00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:30.733
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the response to that from the radicals </v>

146
00:09:33.231 --> 00:09:34.064
<v Speaker 2>is that pseudo science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though the people who are doing </v>

147
00:09:37.851 --> 00:09:42.851
<v Speaker 2>these studies aren't conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there aren't conservatives in the social</v>

148
00:09:42.991 --> 00:09:43.824
<v Speaker 2>sciences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so people do these studies and </v>

149
00:09:45.421 --> 00:09:46.254
<v Speaker 2>they're shocked by the results they </v>
<v Speaker 2>publish them because they're good </v>

150
00:09:48.001 --> 00:09:48.834
<v Speaker 2>scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not because these findings buttress </v>

151
00:09:51.841 --> 00:09:52.674
<v Speaker 2>their ideological position and plus </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's ideological position wasn't to </v>

152
00:09:56.851 --> 00:10:01.851
<v Speaker 2>wish that as you flatten out the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sociological and political landscape,</v>

153
00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:05.100
<v Speaker 2>you make men and women more different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who is hoping for that?</v>

154
00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:09.530
<v Speaker 2>No one was hoping for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as,</v>

155
00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:14.560
<v Speaker 2>as the science stacks up the legislative</v>
<v Speaker 2>and political attempts to silence it and</v>

156
00:10:15.471 --> 00:10:19.250
<v Speaker 2>to mount an ideological counterattack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>multiply</v>

157
00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:22.093
<v Speaker 1>what do we need more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more general science because the </v>

158
00:10:25.301 --> 00:10:29.230
<v Speaker 1>differences are accelerating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now we need even more,</v>

159
00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:35.170
<v Speaker 1>more of the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I would like to jump into the,</v>

160
00:10:37.311 --> 00:10:39.540
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

161
00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:40.553
<v Speaker 1>to the book and see what I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I read your book or I didn't </v>

162
00:10:44.751 --> 00:10:47.030
<v Speaker 1>really read it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually listened to it,</v>

163
00:10:47.031 --> 00:10:50.040
<v Speaker 1>which was I can really recommend to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people because you,</v>

164
00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:54.830
<v Speaker 1>you did a fantastic job of reading the </v>
<v Speaker 1>book by yourself.</v>

165
00:10:54.831 --> 00:10:55.664
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>

166
00:10:57.460 --> 00:10:58.293
<v Speaker 2>I was looking at the reviews on audible </v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's a performance review and a </v>

167
00:11:01.891 --> 00:11:02.724
<v Speaker 2>content review.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Performance Review is higher than the </v>

168
00:11:05.791 --> 00:11:08.850
<v Speaker 2>content review and I don't know what to </v>
<v Speaker 2>think about that.</v>

169
00:11:08.851 --> 00:11:10.770
<v Speaker 2>I don't know whether I should be happy </v>
<v Speaker 2>about that.</v>

170
00:11:10.771 --> 00:11:13.170
<v Speaker 2>Are Not happy about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not much difference,</v>

171
00:11:13.171 --> 00:11:14.400
<v Speaker 2>but I thought it was comical.</v>

172
00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:19.550
<v Speaker 1>I think you should stop writing and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should just be a narrator of books.</v>

173
00:11:19.551 --> 00:11:21.110
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the takeaway.</v>

174
00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:23.710
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do an audio book version of</v>

175
00:11:23.711 --> 00:11:26.330
<v Speaker 2>maps of meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

176
00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:27.800
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

177
00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:32.620
<v Speaker 2>that's coming that be like 25 hours long</v>
<v Speaker 2>or something like that.</v>

178
00:11:32.621 --> 00:11:34.360
<v Speaker 2>Probably more so.</v>

179
00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:37.780
<v Speaker 1>That's the first book I read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

180
00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:40.200
<v Speaker 1>as an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an audiobook was better angels of our</v>

181
00:11:40.201 --> 00:11:44.280
<v Speaker 1>nature by Steven Pinker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 50 hours or something.</v>

182
00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:48.270
<v Speaker 1>So it was a 25 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not so bad.</v>

183
00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:52.320
<v Speaker 2>Abi Bout too because it's a long book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm probably,</v>

184
00:11:52.321 --> 00:11:55.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm probably the amount of time we'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>see</v>

185
00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:02.210
<v Speaker 1>in your book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the first room stand up straight</v>

186
00:12:02.211 --> 00:12:04.400
<v Speaker 1>with your shoulders back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a really.</v>

187
00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:07.250
<v Speaker 1>When you read the chapter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a really good chapter.</v>

188
00:12:07.251 --> 00:12:09.370
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

189
00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:11.830
<v Speaker 1>as last time when I spoke to speak to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

190
00:12:11.831 --> 00:12:16.831
<v Speaker 1>I went into the Jordan Peterson found </v>
<v Speaker 1>groups in Sweden and uh,</v>

191
00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:20.920
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I asked them what,</v>

192
00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:23.530
<v Speaker 1>what do you think I should ask you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they,</v>

193
00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:27.270
<v Speaker 1>one of the guys was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

194
00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:28.193
<v Speaker 1>I really liked the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when it says stand up straight with </v>

195
00:12:30.421 --> 00:12:31.254
<v Speaker 1>your children's back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you should explain more how to </v>

196
00:12:34.331 --> 00:12:38.270
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then a lot of the helpful other guys</v>

197
00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:41.810
<v Speaker 1>in the threads started giving him </v>
<v Speaker 1>physical exercises,</v>

198
00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:44.900
<v Speaker 1>how to strengthen the muscles between </v>
<v Speaker 1>the shoulders,</v>

199
00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:49.130
<v Speaker 1>how your shoulders back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like a long thread on how to,</v>

200
00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.990
<v Speaker 1>how to build your chest up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

201
00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:52.873
<v Speaker 1>and then in the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like after 20 or 30 comments like </v>

202
00:12:55.191 --> 00:12:59.030
<v Speaker 1>somebody suggested that maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you didn't mean it.</v>

203
00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:02.210
<v Speaker 1>Literally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He also meant it figuratively.</v>

204
00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:03.730
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was no,</v>

205
00:13:03.731 --> 00:13:05.590
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no meanness or anything.</v>

206
00:13:05.591 --> 00:13:09.910
<v Speaker 1>But then it wasn't that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't a physical advice.</v>

207
00:13:09.911 --> 00:13:14.080
<v Speaker 1>It was mostly sort of a psychological </v>
<v Speaker 1>advice,</v>

208
00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:17.620
<v Speaker 2>a good place where the metaphorical and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the literal meet.</v>

209
00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:21.500
<v Speaker 2>Actually the important part of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>chapter,</v>

210
00:13:21.501 --> 00:13:26.420
<v Speaker 2>I think a part is that I was really </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to make a case and this is a case</v>

211
00:13:26.421 --> 00:13:30.260
<v Speaker 2>that needs to be made over and over and </v>
<v Speaker 2>over until people understand it.</v>

212
00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:31.383
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a book I would recommend that </v>

213
00:13:32.481 --> 00:13:34.550
<v Speaker 2>was recently written called the great </v>
<v Speaker 2>leveler,</v>

214
00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:38.540
<v Speaker 2>like Walter Shy Dale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's the study of inequality.</v>

215
00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:39.613
<v Speaker 2>And it's a brutal book because one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the things she does is he calculates </v>

216
00:13:43.341 --> 00:13:45.890
<v Speaker 2>inequality coefficients,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the Gini Coefficient,</v>

217
00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:48.890
<v Speaker 2>which is a measure of inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>economic inequality,</v>

218
00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:50.083
<v Speaker 2>and he looks over the empirical data to </v>
<v Speaker 2>see if there's any relationship between </v>

219
00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:54.583
<v Speaker 2>the the left or the right wing nature of</v>
<v Speaker 2>a government and the inequality in the </v>

220
00:14:00.411 --> 00:14:01.244
<v Speaker 2>society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what you'd hope because </v>

221
00:14:03.141 --> 00:14:05.180
<v Speaker 2>inequality is actually a genuine </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

222
00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:06.403
<v Speaker 2>You'd hope that left wing governments </v>
<v Speaker 2>were better at regulating inequality </v>

223
00:14:12.231 --> 00:14:13.520
<v Speaker 2>than right wing governments.</v>

224
00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:16.460
<v Speaker 2>You'd hope that there's no evidence for </v>
<v Speaker 2>that whatsoever.</v>

225
00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:17.683
<v Speaker 2>So I'm making a case in chapter one that</v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies exist and because </v>

226
00:14:22.941 --> 00:14:25.130
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies exist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>inequality exists,</v>

227
00:14:25.131 --> 00:14:28.910
<v Speaker 2>or at least the two things are are </v>
<v Speaker 2>indistinguishable at many levels,</v>

228
00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:30.493
<v Speaker 2>but that you can't blame the existence </v>
<v Speaker 2>of hierarchy or inequality on something </v>

229
00:14:34.671 --> 00:14:38.780
<v Speaker 2>proximal like capitalism or Western </v>
<v Speaker 2>society.</v>

230
00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:42.800
<v Speaker 2>Inequality is the rule all the way back </v>
<v Speaker 2>down to crustaceans.</v>

231
00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:44.203
<v Speaker 2>And so when the Marxists complained </v>
<v Speaker 2>about inequality and how intractable it </v>

232
00:14:47.331 --> 00:14:49.070
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while they have a point,</v>

233
00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:50.173
<v Speaker 2>but when they blame it on capitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not taking the problem </v>

234
00:14:52.941 --> 00:14:56.990
<v Speaker 2>seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's way worse than the Marxist.</v>

235
00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:01.670
<v Speaker 2>Think</v>
<v Speaker 2>inequality is genuinely a problem.</v>

236
00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:04.580
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a problem in,</v>

237
00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:06.490
<v Speaker 2>in a bunch of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first is,</v>

238
00:15:06.491 --> 00:15:07.324
<v Speaker 2>is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>those at the top tend to get more and </v>

239
00:15:11.331 --> 00:15:15.230
<v Speaker 2>those at the bottom tend to end up with </v>
<v Speaker 2>zero and zero's really not good.</v>

240
00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:17.420
<v Speaker 2>Now you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

241
00:15:17.421 --> 00:15:21.230
<v Speaker 2>in the capitalist society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in modern industrial capitalist society,</v>

242
00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:24.950
<v Speaker 2>people tend not to end up at zero so </v>
<v Speaker 2>much and that seems to be true.</v>

243
00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:26.830
<v Speaker 2>It is definitely the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

244
00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:29.750
<v Speaker 2>and I think pinker has done a good job </v>
<v Speaker 2>of outlining this,</v>

245
00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:30.843
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that people that human progress.org are </v>

246
00:15:32.271 --> 00:15:36.170
<v Speaker 2>doing a good job of the two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely the case that our modern</v>

247
00:15:36.171 --> 00:15:41.060
<v Speaker 2>societies are making the poor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much less absolutely poor.</v>

248
00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:42.703
<v Speaker 2>So we've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've decreased poverty worldwide </v>

249
00:15:44.481 --> 00:15:49.070
<v Speaker 2>between 2000 and 2012 by 50 percent a </v>
<v Speaker 2>massive accomplishment.</v>

250
00:15:49.071 --> 00:15:50.870
<v Speaker 2>We should be partying in the streets </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

251
00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:55.340
<v Speaker 2>It's an amazing accomplishment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but inequality is still a problem.</v>

252
00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:56.653
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that chapter's about how deep the </v>

253
00:15:59.151 --> 00:16:00.860
<v Speaker 2>problem is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

254
00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:06.150
<v Speaker 2>the suggestion is is that to compete in </v>
<v Speaker 2>a world where there's unequal outcome,</v>

255
00:16:06.291 --> 00:16:10.820
<v Speaker 2>your best bet is to take the full </v>
<v Speaker 2>tragedy of being full frontal,</v>

256
00:16:10.821 --> 00:16:11.870
<v Speaker 2>essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

257
00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:12.883
<v Speaker 2>To open yourself up to the catastrophe </v>
<v Speaker 2>of existence and to move forward with </v>

258
00:16:17.151 --> 00:16:22.151
<v Speaker 2>courage and and and with nobility and </v>
<v Speaker 2>with with truth on your tongue.</v>

259
00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:25.010
<v Speaker 2>That's your best bet and I do believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

260
00:16:25.011 --> 00:16:25.844
<v Speaker 2>Now I can give you an example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We did research on a program called the </v>

261
00:16:31.251 --> 00:16:32.084
<v Speaker 2>future authoring program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's a part of the suite that's </v>

262
00:16:35.451 --> 00:16:38.840
<v Speaker 2>offered at self authoring dog come and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we did the research.</v>

263
00:16:38.841 --> 00:16:39.674
<v Speaker 2>The idea was to produce psychological </v>
<v Speaker 2>interventions that were very cost </v>

264
00:16:43.881 --> 00:16:46.280
<v Speaker 2>effective that could be distributed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>many people,</v>

265
00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:49.220
<v Speaker 2>but we wanted to test them because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>never know if you're an idiot.</v>

266
00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:51.890
<v Speaker 2>Intervention is going to do something </v>
<v Speaker 2>good or something bad.</v>

267
00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:55.040
<v Speaker 2>That's like rule number one for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>serious social scientists.</v>

268
00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:56.203
<v Speaker 2>Assume your idiot intervention will </v>
<v Speaker 2>either be useless or harmful because </v>

269
00:17:00.501 --> 00:17:02.450
<v Speaker 2>those are the most likely outcomes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

270
00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:03.763
<v Speaker 2>And any social scientist who's truly </v>
<v Speaker 2>credible understands that those who </v>

271
00:17:08.151 --> 00:17:09.950
<v Speaker 2>don't are not educated properly.</v>

272
00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:11.683
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we tested the future authoring program </v>

273
00:17:13.251 --> 00:17:18.251
<v Speaker 2>and we mostly tested it in Holland and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we did some stratification by group,</v>

274
00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:21.860
<v Speaker 2>so in Holland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was at the Rotterdam School of,</v>

275
00:17:22.070 --> 00:17:25.550
<v Speaker 2>at at the Rotterdam School of management</v>
<v Speaker 2>at Erasmus University.</v>

276
00:17:25.551 --> 00:17:26.384
<v Speaker 2>We had thousands of university students </v>
<v Speaker 2>do the future authoring program where </v>

277
00:17:29.241 --> 00:17:30.074
<v Speaker 2>they laid out a plan for their life and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they tried to optimize their lives </v>

278
00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:37.610
<v Speaker 2>along.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to consider their friendships,</v>

279
00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:39.680
<v Speaker 2>intimate relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 2>career choices,</v>

280
00:17:39.681 --> 00:17:42.140
<v Speaker 2>educational choices,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mental and physical health,</v>

281
00:17:42.141 --> 00:17:46.850
<v Speaker 2>use of drugs and alcohol and use of time</v>
<v Speaker 2>productively outside of work to optimize</v>

282
00:17:46.851 --> 00:17:50.780
<v Speaker 2>across all those levels and then to </v>
<v Speaker 2>avoid catastrophic pitfalls.</v>

283
00:17:50.781 --> 00:17:51.614
<v Speaker 2>So you write about what your life could </v>
<v Speaker 2>be like if you could have what you </v>

284
00:17:55.231 --> 00:17:57.160
<v Speaker 2>needed in three to five years and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

285
00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:58.103
<v Speaker 2>right about what your life could be like</v>
<v Speaker 2>if everything fell apart on you and and </v>

286
00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:02.490
<v Speaker 2>things went bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

287
00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:03.930
<v Speaker 2>so they all did this exercise.</v>

288
00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:06.480
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before the exercise,</v>

289
00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:09.930
<v Speaker 2>the Dutch women were outperforming the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dutchman,</v>

290
00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:15.240
<v Speaker 2>let's say the Caucasians and the Non </v>
<v Speaker 2>Western ethnic minority women were doing</v>

291
00:18:16.321 --> 00:18:17.154
<v Speaker 2>worse than the Dutchman and the non </v>
<v Speaker 2>western ethic minority men were doing </v>

292
00:18:20.131 --> 00:18:21.480
<v Speaker 2>worse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the worst of all,</v>

293
00:18:21.481 --> 00:18:22.314
<v Speaker 2>four groups,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about an 85 percent performance </v>

294
00:18:24.901 --> 00:18:28.890
<v Speaker 2>detriment compared to the Dutch women </v>
<v Speaker 2>two years after the intervention.</v>

295
00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:31.290
<v Speaker 2>They were doing better than the Dutch </v>
<v Speaker 2>women,</v>

296
00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:34.410
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

297
00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:36.210
<v Speaker 2>it blew us away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We couldn't believe.</v>

298
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:40.390
<v Speaker 2>And that's research published with </v>
<v Speaker 2>mckayla shipper and and,</v>

299
00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:41.263
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and some other colleagues that from </v>

300
00:18:42.661 --> 00:18:43.494
<v Speaker 2>Holland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what was so interesting about that </v>

301
00:18:46.021 --> 00:18:46.854
<v Speaker 2>was that a psychological intervention </v>
<v Speaker 2>seemed to remove the barriers that were </v>

302
00:18:51.001 --> 00:18:54.240
<v Speaker 2>produced by what was hypothetically </v>
<v Speaker 2>associate logical barrier.</v>

303
00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:55.963
<v Speaker 2>It might be that if you're an immigrant </v>
<v Speaker 2>to a country that you don't have your </v>

304
00:18:58.831 --> 00:19:00.780
<v Speaker 2>story straight because it's so </v>
<v Speaker 2>complicated.</v>

305
00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:03.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you need a better plan.</v>

306
00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:06.350
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's part of standing up.</v>

307
00:19:06.351 --> 00:19:07.280
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay man,</v>

308
00:19:07.281 --> 00:19:08.114
<v Speaker 2>make a plan for the future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>plan a good future and move forward </v>

309
00:19:11.811 --> 00:19:12.644
<v Speaker 2>towards it.</v>

310
00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:15.730
<v Speaker 1>And also one thing that I took away </v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

311
00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:20.960
<v Speaker 1>from the chapters and take yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously.</v>

312
00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:27.130
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise no one else will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't stand up for yourself,</v>

313
00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:32.990
<v Speaker 1>you will get pushed down and pushed over</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not be taking notice.</v>

314
00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:34.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

315
00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:35.523
<v Speaker 2>I think the way you take yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>seriously as you start to constrain </v>

316
00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:41.020
<v Speaker 2>yourself as a player in the catastrophe </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the world.</v>

317
00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:44.320
<v Speaker 2>Now the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is a motif route.</v>

318
00:19:44.321 --> 00:19:46.900
<v Speaker 2>12 rules for life in many ways is a very</v>
<v Speaker 2>dark book.</v>

319
00:19:46.901 --> 00:19:50.740
<v Speaker 2>Although it has a very optimistic </v>
<v Speaker 2>central message.</v>

320
00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:55.300
<v Speaker 2>The darkness is life is tragic and </v>
<v Speaker 2>tainted by malevolence,</v>

321
00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:56.703
<v Speaker 2>but the optimism is there's a hell of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot more to you than you think and I </v>

322
00:20:00.621 --> 00:20:01.454
<v Speaker 2>think that's a message that's really </v>
<v Speaker 2>good for people because everyone knows </v>

323
00:20:03.801 --> 00:20:06.620
<v Speaker 2>that life is a catastrophe that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>tainted by malevolence.</v>

324
00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:07.633
<v Speaker 2>Everyone knows that even if people don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to admit it at the bottom of their </v>

325
00:20:09.861 --> 00:20:10.694
<v Speaker 2>heart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they know it and I think they also </v>

326
00:20:12.711 --> 00:20:15.560
<v Speaker 2>suspect that there's more to them than </v>
<v Speaker 2>meets the eye.</v>

327
00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:19.630
<v Speaker 2>So and so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

328
00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:20.703
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the trick to taking yourself seriously </v>

329
00:20:22.101 --> 00:20:27.101
<v Speaker 2>is to understand that your errors count.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They make things worse.</v>

330
00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:28.073
<v Speaker 2>Like it really is the case that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>matters whether you get your act </v>

331
00:20:30.691 --> 00:20:31.524
<v Speaker 2>together at least because if you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>fragmented and disillusioned and </v>

332
00:20:36.031 --> 00:20:40.230
<v Speaker 2>resentful and angry and working to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>things worse,</v>

333
00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:41.153
<v Speaker 2>you really can make them worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The school shooters are a good example </v>

334
00:20:44.711 --> 00:20:45.544
<v Speaker 2>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People who become so nihilistic and </v>

335
00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:50.130
<v Speaker 2>desperate and then angry that no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

336
00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:52.630
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they slaughter the innocent in,</v>

337
00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:54.710
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a fit events fullness.</v>

338
00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:58.960
<v Speaker 2>Like that's sort of the bottom end of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the descent for human beings.</v>

339
00:20:58.961 --> 00:20:59.950
<v Speaker 2>It's really terrible</v>

340
00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:10.230
<v Speaker 1>because you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

341
00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:11.180
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

342
00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:14.960
<v Speaker 1>you deal a lot with Christianity and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christian thought with both,</v>

343
00:21:14.961 --> 00:21:19.961
<v Speaker 1>with mostly with the old testament but </v>
<v Speaker 1>also with new testament in the Christian</v>

344
00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:26.960
<v Speaker 1>motifs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you get the sense from your book,</v>

345
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.040
<v Speaker 1>from your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your teaching when you talk about this,</v>

346
00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:32.973
<v Speaker 1>that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can really create for ourselves in </v>

347
00:21:38.851 --> 00:21:39.684
<v Speaker 1>this world when we have no problem with </v>
<v Speaker 1>creating a variety of health for </v>

348
00:21:44.041 --> 00:21:48.330
<v Speaker 1>ourselves and for others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's within our,</v>

349
00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:49.350
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>

350
00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:52.070
<v Speaker 2>in our grasp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly right.</v>

351
00:21:52.071 --> 00:21:54.620
<v Speaker 2>Is that hell is definitely within our </v>
<v Speaker 2>grasp.</v>

352
00:21:55.670 --> 00:21:56.503
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think with our engineering we can </v>

353
00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:04.400
<v Speaker 1>invent many kinds of health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I would also,</v>

354
00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:06.913
<v Speaker 1>do you think there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do we have the capacity to create </v>

355
00:22:10.461 --> 00:22:14.470
<v Speaker 1>paradise on earth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think that within our grasp,</v>

356
00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:17.940
<v Speaker 2>I think that that's what we struggle </v>
<v Speaker 2>upwards toward.</v>

357
00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:22.440
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking recently about this image</v>

358
00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:25.920
<v Speaker 2>came to mind of St Joseph's oratorial in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Montreal,</v>

359
00:22:25.921 --> 00:22:29.020
<v Speaker 2>which is a huge religious building.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

360
00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:33.030
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the biggest cathedral.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's a cathedral because I</v>

361
00:22:33.031 --> 00:22:33.864
<v Speaker 2>think it's an oratorial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although I don't know technically the </v>

362
00:22:35.731 --> 00:22:37.010
<v Speaker 2>difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

363
00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:41.130
<v Speaker 2>but it's one of the biggest religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>edifice is in the world and it was built</v>

364
00:22:41.131 --> 00:22:41.964
<v Speaker 2>in the latter half of the 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is quite interesting because most </v>

365
00:22:45.151 --> 00:22:48.360
<v Speaker 2>buildings have religious significance </v>
<v Speaker 2>work built that late.</v>

366
00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:50.310
<v Speaker 2>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's up on Mount Royal,</v>

367
00:22:50.311 --> 00:22:53.760
<v Speaker 2>so it's up on the hill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's the city on the hill,</v>

368
00:22:53.761 --> 00:22:55.620
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the universal city on the hill.</v>

369
00:22:55.621 --> 00:22:58.220
<v Speaker 2>It's an image of perfection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot.</v>

370
00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:59.073
<v Speaker 2>It's like stonework lit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the interior of a forest devoted </v>

371
00:23:03.001 --> 00:23:05.250
<v Speaker 2>towards the glory of being in God.</v>

372
00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:06.450
<v Speaker 2>So it's an image of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

373
00:23:06.810 --> 00:23:08.850
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of paradise we could say.</v>

374
00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:14.100
<v Speaker 2>And then it's at the top of the hill and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you climb up to it as a consequence of a</v>

375
00:23:14.101 --> 00:23:14.934
<v Speaker 2>very large staircase set into the hill </v>
<v Speaker 2>and pilgrims went there quite regularly </v>

376
00:23:19.321 --> 00:23:20.154
<v Speaker 2>in the 20th century who were often </v>
<v Speaker 2>physically disabled and so they would </v>

377
00:23:22.801 --> 00:23:25.950
<v Speaker 2>struggle up the hill on their crutches </v>
<v Speaker 2>or or or,</v>

378
00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:27.570
<v Speaker 2>or with their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with their,</v>

379
00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:30.180
<v Speaker 2>with their damaged limbs and with their </v>
<v Speaker 2>illnesses.</v>

380
00:23:30.181 --> 00:23:34.980
<v Speaker 2>And so they would struggle up the hill </v>
<v Speaker 2>towards the heavenly city essentially.</v>

381
00:23:34.981 --> 00:23:37.500
<v Speaker 2>And that's what we're to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's correct.</v>

382
00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:39.960
<v Speaker 2>That it's a drama that people were </v>
<v Speaker 2>acting out.</v>

383
00:23:39.961 --> 00:23:40.794
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>St Joseph's also happens to be full of </v>

384
00:23:42.871 --> 00:23:47.871
<v Speaker 2>crutches that people left there for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is quite interesting to see.</v>

385
00:23:48.051 --> 00:23:49.130
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't,</v>

386
00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:50.143
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't matter in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So much as the symbolic meaning is all </v>

387
00:23:53.331 --> 00:23:56.030
<v Speaker 2>these damaged people who were carrying a</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible load,</v>

388
00:23:56.031 --> 00:23:59.810
<v Speaker 2>like they weren't just subject to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>normative tragedy of being.</v>

389
00:23:59.810 --> 00:24:00.643
<v Speaker 2>They were also physically disabled would</v>
<v Speaker 2>go there and struggle up these hundreds </v>

390
00:24:03.381 --> 00:24:07.550
<v Speaker 2>of stairs as they were trying to send </v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of descending.</v>

391
00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:08.893
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

392
00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:11.960
<v Speaker 2>we can certainly believe in hell if we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have any sense.</v>

393
00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:15.290
<v Speaker 2>If you don't believe that human beings </v>
<v Speaker 2>can create hell,</v>

394
00:24:15.291 --> 00:24:17.690
<v Speaker 2>then you're a child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a naive child,</v>

395
00:24:17.691 --> 00:24:18.524
<v Speaker 2>you know nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know nothing about history or </v>

396
00:24:20.151 --> 00:24:22.400
<v Speaker 2>yourself and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

397
00:24:22.401 --> 00:24:24.770
<v Speaker 2>can we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can we bring paradise into being?</v>

398
00:24:24.771 --> 00:24:25.341
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

399
00:24:25.341 --> 00:24:26.174
<v Speaker 2>but maybe we can at least walk up the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hill away from hell and who knows what </v>

400
00:24:29.661 --> 00:24:33.050
<v Speaker 2>we could do if we took it seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we took our,</v>

401
00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:37.460
<v Speaker 2>the idea that we needed to shoulder our </v>
<v Speaker 2>burden and with truth,</v>

402
00:24:37.461 --> 00:24:38.294
<v Speaker 2>if we took that seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as serious as the hell should make you </v>

403
00:24:41.271 --> 00:24:43.670
<v Speaker 2>take it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who knows what we could accomplish?</v>

404
00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:44.930
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I said,</v>

405
00:24:44.931 --> 00:24:45.764
<v Speaker 2>we've lifted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've reduced the poverty rate in the </v>

406
00:24:49.281 --> 00:24:51.890
<v Speaker 2>world by 50 percent from the year 2000 </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the year,</v>

407
00:24:51.891 --> 00:24:56.891
<v Speaker 2>2012 and something like 300,000 people </v>
<v Speaker 2>are being attached to the power grid.</v>

408
00:24:57.141 --> 00:24:57.974
<v Speaker 2>Now worldwide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember if it's a week or a </v>

409
00:24:59.991 --> 00:25:00.824
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's either of those metrics is </v>

410
00:25:02.241 --> 00:25:06.350
<v Speaker 2>still pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fastest growing economies are in Africa.</v>

411
00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:07.760
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

412
00:25:07.761 --> 00:25:08.594
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've made amazing strides in the last </v>

413
00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:11.473
<v Speaker 2>50 years and they seem to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>accelerating and so I don't know what </v>

414
00:25:14.421 --> 00:25:15.254
<v Speaker 2>the upper limit for us is if we don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>dissolve ourselves into idiot identity </v>

415
00:25:18.891 --> 00:25:20.070
<v Speaker 2>politics and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

416
00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:22.970
<v Speaker 2>and start a civil war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

417
00:25:24.010 --> 00:25:24.843
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

418
00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:30.010
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the reasons why very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I certainly do.</v>

419
00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:37.060
<v Speaker 1>I think people in general do as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a very easy time imagining horrible,</v>

420
00:25:37.061 --> 00:25:41.530
<v Speaker 1>horrible things and daydreaming about </v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible things,</v>

421
00:25:41.531 --> 00:25:46.040
<v Speaker 1>horrible things that could happen to you</v>
<v Speaker 1>or things that you could do and uh,</v>

422
00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:50.230
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's very hard to imagine a heaven.</v>

423
00:25:50.231 --> 00:25:53.800
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at Dante.</v>

424
00:25:53.801 --> 00:25:55.550
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inferno.</v>

425
00:25:55.551 --> 00:25:59.120
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he wrote about heaven as well.</v>

426
00:25:59.121 --> 00:26:04.121
<v Speaker 1>I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 1>a really boring book.</v>

427
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:05.833
<v Speaker 1>Angels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>angels in white singing and stuff like </v>

428
00:26:09.951 --> 00:26:10.784
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it's,</v>

429
00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:14.660
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't sound like heaven to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a but hell sounds like hell</v>

430
00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:18.320
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

431
00:26:18.321 --> 00:26:19.154
<v Speaker 2>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

432
00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:23.690
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say mainstream Christians,</v>

433
00:26:23.691 --> 00:26:24.524
<v Speaker 2>especially on the Protestant and have </v>
<v Speaker 2>tried to force hell out of the human </v>

434
00:26:27.291 --> 00:26:28.124
<v Speaker 2>imagination over the last hundred years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe as a way of making Christianity </v>

435
00:26:31.491 --> 00:26:33.590
<v Speaker 2>more marketable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although I don't think it's worked,</v>

436
00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:39.010
<v Speaker 2>but I do think that belief in hell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>metaphorically,</v>

437
00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:40.953
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although I tell you if you're in one of </v>

438
00:26:42.071 --> 00:26:44.010
<v Speaker 2>those situations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it feels eternal,</v>

439
00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:45.263
<v Speaker 2>so that's something to keep in mind too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's unbelievably salutary </v>

440
00:26:49.261 --> 00:26:52.830
<v Speaker 2>because even though we can't imagine </v>
<v Speaker 2>heaven so clearly,</v>

441
00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:54.300
<v Speaker 2>we can certainly say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

442
00:26:54.301 --> 00:26:57.560
<v Speaker 2>at least it's not Auschwitz.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

443
00:26:57.950 --> 00:26:59.520
<v Speaker 2>Totally agree on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever it is,</v>

444
00:26:59.521 --> 00:27:02.250
<v Speaker 2>it's as far away from Auschwitz as you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can get</v>

445
00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:05.770
<v Speaker 2>and that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a direction you know,</v>

446
00:27:05.771 --> 00:27:06.520
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

447
00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:09.010
<v Speaker 2>it's not as specific as you might like </v>
<v Speaker 2>it to be,</v>

448
00:27:09.011 --> 00:27:09.844
<v Speaker 2>but that's also why I've been suggesting</v>
<v Speaker 2>to people that they think about this </v>

449
00:27:12.281 --> 00:27:12.850
<v Speaker 2>locally.</v>

450
00:27:12.850 --> 00:27:13.683
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

451
00:27:13.930 --> 00:27:18.760
<v Speaker 2>we're not so sure what the utopia might </v>
<v Speaker 2>be and we know that collectively,</v>

452
00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:22.240
<v Speaker 2>presuming a utopia also seems to be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous thing,</v>

453
00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:23.523
<v Speaker 2>but there are stupid things that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing to make your life and the life of </v>

454
00:27:26.531 --> 00:27:29.590
<v Speaker 2>people around you more wretched and </v>
<v Speaker 2>miserable than necessary,</v>

455
00:27:29.770 --> 00:27:33.240
<v Speaker 2>and it's hypothetically the case that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you could stop doing some of them,</v>

456
00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:37.590
<v Speaker 2>so there is a good place to start.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's nice and humble.</v>

457
00:27:37.591 --> 00:27:40.530
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're less than you could be </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know it,</v>

458
00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:43.470
<v Speaker 2>and there's things you could do about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and you know it.</v>

459
00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:44.903
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so maybe maybe it would be okay to take </v>

460
00:27:47.371 --> 00:27:48.930
<v Speaker 2>a step in the right direction,</v>

461
00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:54.720
<v Speaker 1>think you say in the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you open the return to the,</v>

462
00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:55.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

463
00:27:56.840 --> 00:28:01.730
<v Speaker 1>the basic truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you say that you arrive at this when</v>

464
00:28:01.731 --> 00:28:02.564
<v Speaker 1>you contemplate the horribleness of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>20th century with Auschwitz and the </v>

465
00:28:09.321 --> 00:28:14.321
<v Speaker 1>Gulag and the life there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>life is suffering and you can't,</v>

466
00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:18.050
<v Speaker 1>you can produce the way the pain of </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>

467
00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:21.840
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no totalitarian that can reduce</v>

468
00:28:21.841 --> 00:28:22.674
<v Speaker 1>the way that</v>

469
00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:23.753
<v Speaker 2>you can just forbid it in Venezuela.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's illegal to last list the cause </v>

470
00:28:29.311 --> 00:28:32.410
<v Speaker 2>of the death of a child as starvation in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hospitals.</v>

471
00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:34.700
<v Speaker 2>That's convenient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes.</v>

472
00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:36.690
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that something?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that something?</v>

473
00:28:36.691 --> 00:28:38.730
<v Speaker 2>So there we go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we've got the utopia.</v>

474
00:28:38.731 --> 00:28:42.450
<v Speaker 2>It's now illegal to die of starvation in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hospital in Venezuela,</v>

475
00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:45.480
<v Speaker 2>or at least to have it listed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's exactly it,</v>

476
00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:47.850
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is a little slice of hell for you.</v>

477
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:56.230
<v Speaker 1>One of the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's easier to move away from,</v>

478
00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:57.990
<v Speaker 1>it's not easy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

479
00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:03.050
<v Speaker 1>it's easier to stop doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>causing harm and causing suffering.</v>

480
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:04.830
<v Speaker 1>Then too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

481
00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:09.850
<v Speaker 1>Ryan at bliss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's sort of a basic way.</v>

482
00:29:10.781 --> 00:29:15.760
<v Speaker 1>We are very bad at a pretty bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

483
00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:19.620
<v Speaker 1>having eternal bliss in this life.</v>

484
00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:21.011
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

485
00:29:21.011 --> 00:29:22.930
<v Speaker 2>it's not easy to conceptualize what it </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be.</v>

486
00:29:22.931 --> 00:29:23.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do,</v>

487
00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:26.170
<v Speaker 2>you do taste it at times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

488
00:29:26.171 --> 00:29:29.110
<v Speaker 2>you tasted with music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course that's why there's imagery</v>

489
00:29:29.111 --> 00:29:32.470
<v Speaker 2>of angels and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the heavenly hosts singing,</v>

490
00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:33.713
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because people do get a taste of what </v>

491
00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:38.140
<v Speaker 2>paradise might be like when they </v>
<v Speaker 2>listened to music,</v>

492
00:29:38.170 --> 00:29:39.003
<v Speaker 2>which is why music is so powerful for </v>
<v Speaker 2>people because it speaks of a kind of </v>

493
00:29:42.551 --> 00:29:45.790
<v Speaker 2>transcendent harmony of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the layers of being.</v>

494
00:29:45.791 --> 00:29:46.624
<v Speaker 2>And it engages a person in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you get that as well when you're </v>

495
00:29:49.331 --> 00:29:50.164
<v Speaker 2>engaged in what you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deeply engaged in what you're doing and </v>

496
00:29:52.391 --> 00:29:53.224
<v Speaker 2>finding meaningful but mean stepping </v>
<v Speaker 2>rapidly away from hell might be a form </v>

497
00:29:57.641 --> 00:29:58.870
<v Speaker 2>of bliss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

498
00:29:59.080 --> 00:29:59.913
<v Speaker 2>to know that a minimum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not contributing to the terrible </v>

499
00:30:03.371 --> 00:30:06.600
<v Speaker 2>suffering of the world and maybe you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing something to to lift the,</v>

500
00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:08.800
<v Speaker 2>to lift the burden in a positive way.</v>

501
00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:10.043
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really complicated because you </v>

502
00:30:11.801 --> 00:30:16.300
<v Speaker 2>don't want everything to be easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not a good idea for utopia.</v>

503
00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:18.190
<v Speaker 2>Everything's blissful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uneasy,</v>

504
00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:20.890
<v Speaker 2>and all you're doing is laying back and </v>
<v Speaker 2>eating peeled grapes.</v>

505
00:30:20.891 --> 00:30:21.724
<v Speaker 2>You know it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing to that that would last </v>

506
00:30:23.471 --> 00:30:24.304
<v Speaker 2>more than a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need and need an adventure and you </v>

507
00:30:26.591 --> 00:30:27.424
<v Speaker 2>need a struggle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but perhaps we could have the adventure </v>

508
00:30:30.191 --> 00:30:33.920
<v Speaker 2>and the struggle without the pointless </v>
<v Speaker 2>suffering and malevolence.</v>

509
00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:34.783
<v Speaker 2>We could at least aim at that and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows what we might transmute that </v>

510
00:30:37.551 --> 00:30:38.384
<v Speaker 2>into at least we might be able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>transmute it into lives that are </v>

511
00:30:41.661 --> 00:30:42.494
<v Speaker 2>meaningful despite their suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be a good start and I do </v>

512
00:30:46.041 --> 00:30:46.874
<v Speaker 2>believe that that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that that's an attainable </v>

513
00:30:49.641 --> 00:30:53.270
<v Speaker 2>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that that we are strong enough</v>

514
00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:54.463
<v Speaker 2>as in our essence to rise above the </v>
<v Speaker 2>tragedy of existence and to live </v>

515
00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:02.630
<v Speaker 2>normally and with purpose and honorably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe we can do that,</v>

516
00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:03.703
<v Speaker 2>and so that's why I think 12 rules for </v>
<v Speaker 2>life is a fundamentally optimistic book </v>

517
00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:09.260
<v Speaker 2>because I also think that that's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>believable message.</v>

518
00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:11.940
<v Speaker 2>No one's going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

519
00:31:11.941 --> 00:31:13.130
<v Speaker 2>we believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

520
00:31:13.670 --> 00:31:17.050
<v Speaker 2>we're going to eradicate suffering and </v>
<v Speaker 2>malevolence.</v>

521
00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:18.410
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

522
00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:19.563
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we can constrain it within the </v>

523
00:31:21.531 --> 00:31:25.440
<v Speaker 2>confines of our own being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's good enough.</v>

524
00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:26.550
<v Speaker 2>That's a good start.</v>

525
00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:34.330
<v Speaker 1>Rule number eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

526
00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:35.343
<v Speaker 1>tell the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should tell the truth and you're </v>

527
00:31:40.121 --> 00:31:40.954
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it is our responsibility is to see </v>

528
00:31:42.761 --> 00:31:46.780
<v Speaker 1>what it is before our eyes courageously </v>
<v Speaker 1>and to learn from it,</v>

529
00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:50.390
<v Speaker 1>even if it seems horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if the horror of seeing them,</v>

530
00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:52.840
<v Speaker 1>which is our consciousness and half for </v>
<v Speaker 1>instance.</v>

531
00:31:53.890 --> 00:31:54.723
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I just thought about that for </v>

532
00:31:56.690 --> 00:31:58.660
<v Speaker 1>awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

533
00:31:58.690 --> 00:32:01.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during the,</v>

534
00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:06.900
<v Speaker 1>when Isis invaded Iraq in 2007,</v>
<v Speaker 1>14,</v>

535
00:32:06.931 --> 00:32:10.410
<v Speaker 1>I think it was 2015,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2014.</v>

536
00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:13.030
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

537
00:32:13.031 --> 00:32:18.031
<v Speaker 1>I was one of the few who wrote about</v>
<v Speaker 1>following that right then because nobody</v>

538
00:32:19.331 --> 00:32:22.090
<v Speaker 1>thought it would take over such a large </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of Iraq.</v>

539
00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:28.420
<v Speaker 1>And then I was watching loads of videos </v>
<v Speaker 1>of mass killings and the capitations and</v>

540
00:32:29.241 --> 00:32:31.090
<v Speaker 1>murders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was seeing,</v>

541
00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:32.353
<v Speaker 1>I had contact with eyewitnesses via a </v>
<v Speaker 1>journalists whose names Newark Newer </v>

542
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000
<v Speaker 1>Keno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was horrible,</v>

543
00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:41.990
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really horrible,</v>

544
00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:45.110
<v Speaker 1>horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most horrible thing I've ever seen.</v>

545
00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:48.600
<v Speaker 1>And because I had contact with neuro </v>
<v Speaker 1>Akina,</v>

546
00:32:48.601 --> 00:32:51.470
<v Speaker 1>whose father had had family members down</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

547
00:32:51.630 --> 00:32:55.140
<v Speaker 1>Assyrian Christians who are being </v>
<v Speaker 1>murdered and driven from their homes.</v>

548
00:32:55.610 --> 00:33:00.350
<v Speaker 1>And this was even before the same jar </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they took this sex slaves and they</v>

549
00:33:00.351 --> 00:33:04.390
<v Speaker 1>murdered the whole people use the CDC </v>
<v Speaker 1>app.</v>

550
00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:08.430
<v Speaker 1>So it was really horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so for them,</v>

551
00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:10.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course that's the big deal.</v>

552
00:33:11.210 --> 00:33:12.450
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

553
00:33:12.451 --> 00:33:17.070
<v Speaker 1>I felt I had the responsibility to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>this for myself,</v>

554
00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:21.030
<v Speaker 1>get not just listening to journalists </v>
<v Speaker 1>who hadn't seen it because I was writing</v>

555
00:33:21.031 --> 00:33:21.864
<v Speaker 1>about it a lot myself and I could feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>it changing me because this is the </v>

556
00:33:27.811 --> 00:33:32.760
<v Speaker 1>absolute as close to absolute darkness </v>
<v Speaker 1>as I've ever come come.</v>

557
00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:34.230
<v Speaker 1>Because it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

558
00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:36.810
<v Speaker 1>it was not historical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These for people,</v>

559
00:33:37.170 --> 00:33:39.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some younger than me,</v>

560
00:33:39.151 --> 00:33:39.984
<v Speaker 1>some older.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was happening as I was watching </v>

561
00:33:42.871 --> 00:33:44.230
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

562
00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:48.510
<v Speaker 1>and then I thought about the quote by </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature,</v>

563
00:33:50.490 --> 00:33:53.780
<v Speaker 1>if you gaze into their business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their business also gazes into you.</v>

564
00:33:53.781 --> 00:33:54.614
<v Speaker 1>And I really felt that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about this when I read </v>

565
00:33:58.851 --> 00:34:03.550
<v Speaker 1>your book for the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would ask you that.</v>

566
00:34:03.610 --> 00:34:06.830
<v Speaker 1>How can you be certain that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>defeat the,</v>

567
00:34:06.970 --> 00:34:10.910
<v Speaker 1>the darkness that when you face that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a.</v>

568
00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:16.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that you can be certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can say,</v>

569
00:34:16.031 --> 00:34:16.864
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you go to face the dragon to get the </v>

570
00:34:18.701 --> 00:34:21.720
<v Speaker 2>gold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't be a dragon if it could meet</v>

571
00:34:21.721 --> 00:34:22.554
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The issue isn't that the issue isn't </v>

572
00:34:26.351 --> 00:34:27.184
<v Speaker 2>that you're certain of success.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The issue is that you don't have a </v>

573
00:34:30.131 --> 00:34:30.964
<v Speaker 2>better pathway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if you're going to confront the </v>

574
00:34:34.661 --> 00:34:38.020
<v Speaker 2>dragon of chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say and dare to attain the goal,</v>

575
00:34:38.050 --> 00:34:40.330
<v Speaker 2>then you have to put yourself on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>line for it.</v>

576
00:34:40.810 --> 00:34:41.643
<v Speaker 2>But paradoxically it seems the more </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're willing to put yourself on the </v>

577
00:34:44.231 --> 00:34:45.064
<v Speaker 2>line for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the higher the probability of your </v>

578
00:34:46.451 --> 00:34:47.284
<v Speaker 2>success.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is also the part of opening </v>

579
00:34:49.301 --> 00:34:52.090
<v Speaker 2>yourself up to the catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Knowing.</v>

580
00:34:52.150 --> 00:34:52.983
<v Speaker 2>That's why Christianity has increasingly</v>
<v Speaker 2>occupied the theater of in my </v>

581
00:34:56.681 --> 00:34:59.910
<v Speaker 2>imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's this idea that you know,</v>

582
00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:04.780
<v Speaker 2>even speaking psychologically that </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever Christ represents,</v>

583
00:35:05.530 --> 00:35:06.363
<v Speaker 2>whatever that image is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is in part the call to accept the </v>

584
00:35:11.261 --> 00:35:12.094
<v Speaker 2>catastrophe of existence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to accept it voluntarily because the </v>

585
00:35:15.761 --> 00:35:16.594
<v Speaker 2>fundamental story is that Christ went to</v>
<v Speaker 2>his torturous betrayal with his eyes </v>

586
00:35:21.251 --> 00:35:23.780
<v Speaker 2>open,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right and well,</v>

587
00:35:23.781 --> 00:35:24.890
<v Speaker 2>that's a hell of a thing.</v>

588
00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:25.723
<v Speaker 2>It's no wonder that image has never left</v>
<v Speaker 2>people's imagination because that's the </v>

589
00:35:29.691 --> 00:35:33.320
<v Speaker 2>reason you can't ask any more of someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>than that</v>

590
00:35:35.050 --> 00:35:35.960
<v Speaker 2>and you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

591
00:35:35.961 --> 00:35:39.240
<v Speaker 2>is it okay that everything will be asked</v>
<v Speaker 2>of us?</v>

592
00:35:39.330 --> 00:35:40.163
<v Speaker 2>And the answer is it doesn't matter </v>
<v Speaker 2>because everything is going to be asked </v>

593
00:35:44.661 --> 00:35:45.494
<v Speaker 2>of you like you're going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have to accept that in </v>

594
00:35:48.411 --> 00:35:49.910
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in one form or another.</v>

595
00:35:49.911 --> 00:35:52.660
<v Speaker 2>The question is how well the answer is </v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

596
00:35:52.661 --> 00:35:55.580
<v Speaker 2>You have to open your arms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to accept it.</v>

597
00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:58.340
<v Speaker 2>You know when there's an idea in the new</v>
<v Speaker 2>testament that if you can,</v>

598
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.410
<v Speaker 2>if you can love fate deeply enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can transfer,</v>

599
00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:06.980
<v Speaker 2>you can transcend your limitations of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your mortality.</v>

600
00:36:06.981 --> 00:36:09.500
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

601
00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:12.500
<v Speaker 2>that strikes me as a plausible </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibility.</v>

602
00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:15.410
<v Speaker 2>Now you said when you were watching all </v>
<v Speaker 2>those things that,</v>

603
00:36:15.411 --> 00:36:18.600
<v Speaker 2>that changed you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You mean what did,</v>

604
00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:19.780
<v Speaker 2>what did it change?</v>

605
00:36:20.530 --> 00:36:25.530
<v Speaker 1>You realize</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's your facing something real</v>

606
00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:32.720
<v Speaker 1>if evil has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has meaning,</v>

607
00:36:32.721 --> 00:36:33.554
<v Speaker 1>if there is evil that is evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what if that was sort of then you </v>

608
00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:43.980
<v Speaker 1>have a terrorist attack in Sweden and in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

609
00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:46.430
<v Speaker 1>you started sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would I,</v>

610
00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:49.190
<v Speaker 1>what would I do if I were in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation?</v>

611
00:36:49.191 --> 00:36:53.360
<v Speaker 1>And you speak to people who have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who have relatives there and you realize</v>

612
00:36:53.361 --> 00:36:55.090
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

613
00:36:55.160 --> 00:37:00.160
<v Speaker 1>you're very lucky but you living in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sweden and not there because I,</v>

614
00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:01.560
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

615
00:37:04.070 --> 00:37:07.230
<v Speaker 1>would not be very hard to take up arms </v>
<v Speaker 1>against these people.</v>

616
00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:12.780
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing is that you realize </v>
<v Speaker 1>things about yourself if you,</v>

617
00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:15.010
<v Speaker 1>if it gets to that device.</v>

618
00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:16.190
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

619
00:37:16.290 --> 00:37:19.070
<v Speaker 2>the terrible thing too is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is a Motif,</v>

620
00:37:19.071 --> 00:37:21.260
<v Speaker 2>again that also runs through 12 rules </v>
<v Speaker 2>for life,</v>

621
00:37:21.261 --> 00:37:22.700
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

622
00:37:23.090 --> 00:37:26.860
<v Speaker 2>let's say when the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the.</v>

623
00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:28.093
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you a personal example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I heard about what happened in </v>

624
00:37:30.401 --> 00:37:31.234
<v Speaker 2>Cologne on the new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on New Year's eve and I see I had a </v>

625
00:37:34.991 --> 00:37:39.490
<v Speaker 2>situation where my son was mugged a </v>
<v Speaker 2>number of years ago and he was mugged by</v>

626
00:37:39.491 --> 00:37:40.324
<v Speaker 2>a gang of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of kids that were brought into our </v>

627
00:37:41.861 --> 00:37:46.600
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood as a favor to them so that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they can play basketball in a local boys</v>

628
00:37:46.601 --> 00:37:47.434
<v Speaker 2>and girls club.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there was about six or seven of </v>

629
00:37:49.751 --> 00:37:50.584
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>18 years old and they mugged my 13 year </v>

630
00:37:52.811 --> 00:37:54.820
<v Speaker 2>old son and took his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

631
00:37:54.821 --> 00:37:55.654
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they took his cell phone and he </v>

632
00:37:57.821 --> 00:37:58.654
<v Speaker 2>came home and he was shaken up mostly </v>
<v Speaker 2>with anger because he couldn't believe </v>

633
00:38:02.621 --> 00:38:03.454
<v Speaker 2>that six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>18 year old young men could be so </v>

634
00:38:06.161 --> 00:38:09.610
<v Speaker 2>cowardly that they would gang up on a 13</v>
<v Speaker 2>year old kid.</v>

635
00:38:09.610 --> 00:38:12.280
<v Speaker 2>Like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for him it was a betrayal of humanity</v>

636
00:38:12.490 --> 00:38:13.323
<v Speaker 2>apart from being afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But mostly it was anger on his part and </v>

637
00:38:16.930 --> 00:38:17.763
<v Speaker 2>I was absolutely outraged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I contacted the police and I </v>

638
00:38:21.881 --> 00:38:25.420
<v Speaker 2>contacted the nearby club that had </v>
<v Speaker 2>sponsored two kids and I said,</v>

639
00:38:25.421 --> 00:38:26.680
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what happened.</v>

640
00:38:27.010 --> 00:38:27.843
<v Speaker 2>And they did nothing about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The club knew who it was and wouldn't </v>

641
00:38:30.881 --> 00:38:31.714
<v Speaker 2>release the names because of </v>
<v Speaker 2>confidentiality and all sorts of other </v>

642
00:38:34.151 --> 00:38:39.151
<v Speaker 2>nonsense and I had this fantasy that </v>
<v Speaker 2>went on for weeks about standing outside</v>

643
00:38:40.031 --> 00:38:40.864
<v Speaker 2>the boys and girls club and waiting for </v>
<v Speaker 2>those kids with a lead pipe because I </v>

644
00:38:44.981 --> 00:38:48.400
<v Speaker 2>was not happy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

645
00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:52.450
<v Speaker 2>I was and I couldn't pursue it with any </v>
<v Speaker 2>degree of legal.</v>

646
00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:55.013
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't pursue it to the degree that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to in the legal framework </v>

647
00:38:57.981 --> 00:39:01.550
<v Speaker 2>because at the same time my daughter was</v>
<v Speaker 2>very ill and that was taking precedence.</v>

648
00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:02.383
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had these terrible fantasies come up </v>

649
00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:09.470
<v Speaker 2>over and over the very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very dark fantasies and I talked it over</v>

650
00:39:09.471 --> 00:39:10.304
<v Speaker 2>with my son because I told him what was </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening in my imagination because I </v>

651
00:39:13.131 --> 00:39:15.170
<v Speaker 2>want it to let them know that this </v>
<v Speaker 2>really bothered me.</v>

652
00:39:15.171 --> 00:39:17.570
<v Speaker 2>That he was attacked and that I wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to put up with it.</v>

653
00:39:17.571 --> 00:39:22.080
<v Speaker 2>But I also understood that that's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See.</v>

654
00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:23.213
<v Speaker 2>I would have been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I would have been a very weak </v>

655
00:39:24.931 --> 00:39:29.470
<v Speaker 2>man to not have had those feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you think,</v>

656
00:39:29.471 --> 00:39:30.304
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lots of times it's the better man that </v>

657
00:39:33.121 --> 00:39:33.954
<v Speaker 2>takes up arms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it isn't necessarily the best man </v>

658
00:39:37.301 --> 00:39:41.290
<v Speaker 2>who takes up arms because maybe there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>a place past that you might say,</v>

659
00:39:41.291 --> 00:39:42.124
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's naive it and cowardice that stops </v>

660
00:39:43.601 --> 00:39:46.260
<v Speaker 2>you from defending yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

661
00:39:46.261 --> 00:39:50.310
<v Speaker 2>and then you transcend naivety and </v>
<v Speaker 2>cowardice and then you become dangerous.</v>

662
00:39:51.570 --> 00:39:56.570
<v Speaker 2>But maybe you can transcend dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe there's a place past that.</v>

663
00:39:56.890 --> 00:40:00.390
<v Speaker 2>And well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's hope there is.</v>

664
00:40:06.930 --> 00:40:08.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure if it's in the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

665
00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:11.810
<v Speaker 1>you said it before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to develop some teeth</v>

666
00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:14.713
<v Speaker 1>because you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't mistake a weakness for </v>

667
00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:19.940
<v Speaker 1>virtue.</v>

668
00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:20.773
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

669
00:40:21.130 --> 00:40:22.740
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in Christianity,</v>

670
00:40:22.741 --> 00:40:25.870
<v Speaker 1>and one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing that I struggled with,</v>

671
00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:29.470
<v Speaker 1>Christianity is the meek shall inherit.</v>

672
00:40:29.690 --> 00:40:30.391
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

673
00:40:30.391 --> 00:40:33.250
<v Speaker 2>I read,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I learned it.</v>

674
00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:38.960
<v Speaker 1>The other world of Christianity that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>find very.</v>

675
00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:42.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure if it's a temperamental.</v>

676
00:40:43.110 --> 00:40:45.170
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a mis translation.</v>

677
00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:52.240
<v Speaker 2>I looked that up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a line that always bothered me.</v>

678
00:40:52.241 --> 00:40:53.074
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I did these biblical lectures last </v>

679
00:40:55.690 --> 00:40:57.190
<v Speaker 2>year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I'm going to continue by the way,</v>

680
00:40:57.191 --> 00:40:59.600
<v Speaker 2>as soon as I can possibly manage it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

681
00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:02.920
<v Speaker 2>I looked up that line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a couple of lines that really,</v>

682
00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:07.200
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't forget them.</v>

683
00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:10.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm the poor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will always be with us.</v>

684
00:41:10.171 --> 00:41:11.840
<v Speaker 2>That was one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

685
00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:13.473
<v Speaker 2>to those who have everything more shall </v>
<v Speaker 2>be given from those who have everything </v>

686
00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:20.240
<v Speaker 2>from those who have nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything will be taken away.</v>

687
00:41:20.330 --> 00:41:21.163
<v Speaker 2>That's a rough one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the meek shall inherit the </v>

688
00:41:23.931 --> 00:41:26.420
<v Speaker 2>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But meek is the wrong word.</v>

689
00:41:26.421 --> 00:41:28.880
<v Speaker 2>Has slipped over time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't what it meant.</v>

690
00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:34.100
<v Speaker 2>If you go back into the original,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you go back the original texts,</v>

691
00:41:34.101 --> 00:41:36.870
<v Speaker 2>let's say here's a better translation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

692
00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:40.510
<v Speaker 2>those who have swords and know how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>use them,</v>

693
00:41:40.511 --> 00:41:42.850
<v Speaker 2>but keep the machines will inherit the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world</v>

694
00:41:45.150 --> 00:41:45.983
<v Speaker 2>right</v>

695
00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:52.500
<v Speaker 1>on the cheek in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity.</v>

696
00:41:53.290 --> 00:41:54.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that goes along with that.</v>

697
00:41:54.801 --> 00:41:56.470
<v Speaker 2>Resist not evil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but look,</v>

698
00:41:56.900 --> 00:41:57.733
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you some things I've learned </v>

699
00:41:59.801 --> 00:42:03.760
<v Speaker 2>about that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'll give you two examples.</v>

700
00:42:03.761 --> 00:42:05.440
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

701
00:42:05.441 --> 00:42:06.274
<v Speaker 2>there's been a lot of points for me in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the last 18 months where things could </v>

702
00:42:09.881 --> 00:42:13.340
<v Speaker 2>have gone badly wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

703
00:42:13.341 --> 00:42:14.174
<v Speaker 2>I went to mcmaster university about a </v>
<v Speaker 2>year ago or thereabouts and there was a </v>

704
00:42:17.571 --> 00:42:20.120
<v Speaker 2>big demonstration and it was quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>obnoxious.</v>

705
00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:23.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean there was about 200 people there </v>
<v Speaker 2>that were just see me,</v>

706
00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:24.933
<v Speaker 2>came to see me in about 50 protesters </v>
<v Speaker 2>likely and they drowned me out </v>

707
00:42:28.251 --> 00:42:29.120
<v Speaker 2>completely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

708
00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:31.610
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there was a handful of them who were</v>

709
00:42:31.611 --> 00:42:34.280
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say really not good people,</v>

710
00:42:34.890 --> 00:42:39.680
<v Speaker 2>like most of them were just foolish kids</v>
<v Speaker 2>and foolish self righteous kids who were</v>

711
00:42:39.681 --> 00:42:43.130
<v Speaker 2>diluted by the radiant professors and by</v>
<v Speaker 2>their own resentment.</v>

712
00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:44.293
<v Speaker 2>But there were four or five people there</v>
<v Speaker 2>who would have been perfectly happy in </v>

713
00:42:47.301 --> 00:42:50.540
<v Speaker 2>that crowd that you described that </v>
<v Speaker 2>descended into Iraq.</v>

714
00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:53.030
<v Speaker 2>And I can tell who they were by looking </v>
<v Speaker 2>at them.</v>

715
00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:54.050
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

716
00:42:54.050 --> 00:42:55.880
<v Speaker 2>they were people that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that just,</v>

717
00:42:56.170 --> 00:42:57.290
<v Speaker 2>they just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I</v>

718
00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:01.430
<v Speaker 2>perhaps I'm wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>

719
00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:02.503
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that I could see what they </v>

720
00:43:04.371 --> 00:43:07.120
<v Speaker 2>were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there were two of them behind me,</v>

721
00:43:07.610 --> 00:43:09.800
<v Speaker 2>woman and a man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The woman wasn't quite so bad,</v>

722
00:43:09.801 --> 00:43:13.370
<v Speaker 2>but the man was pretty bad and they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>blaring air horns at me,</v>

723
00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:16.250
<v Speaker 2>an air horn apnea and close enough to </v>
<v Speaker 2>damage my hearing,</v>

724
00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:19.190
<v Speaker 2>which I was not the least bit impressed </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

725
00:43:19.191 --> 00:43:20.210
<v Speaker 2>And I told them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

726
00:43:20.211 --> 00:43:21.980
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can blow your Damn Air Horn,</v>

727
00:43:21.981 --> 00:43:22.814
<v Speaker 2>but if you get it too close to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I went and I went and had a word </v>

728
00:43:25.971 --> 00:43:28.460
<v Speaker 2>with the police at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

729
00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:30.380
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it was quite,</v>

730
00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:32.560
<v Speaker 2>it was quite provoking and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

731
00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:35.840
<v Speaker 2>and pushy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just,</v>

732
00:43:37.550 --> 00:43:40.820
<v Speaker 2>I knew that most of it was foolishness </v>
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

733
00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:45.113
<v Speaker 2>I mostly watched and I tried to give my </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk and it was completely drowned out </v>

734
00:43:49.081 --> 00:43:51.780
<v Speaker 2>and then we had to leave and I gave the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rest of my talk outside.</v>

735
00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:52.613
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of that was filmed and then it was </v>

736
00:43:54.751 --> 00:43:59.310
<v Speaker 2>put up on youtube and all of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences of that holding my temper,</v>

737
00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:01.620
<v Speaker 2>all of the consequences of that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive.</v>

738
00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:03.113
<v Speaker 2>And that's one thing I've really learned</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it is associated with this idea of </v>

739
00:44:06.180 --> 00:44:08.910
<v Speaker 2>resist not evil and also of turning the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other cheek.</v>

740
00:44:08.911 --> 00:44:11.610
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like you can't respond,</v>

741
00:44:12.510 --> 00:44:16.560
<v Speaker 2>it's that you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then without Kathy Newman interview,</v>

742
00:44:16.561 --> 00:44:17.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the same thing.</v>

743
00:44:17.821 --> 00:44:19.920
<v Speaker 2>It's a good really good example of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that</v>

744
00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:23.413
<v Speaker 2>no one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I managed it because I have had </v>

745
00:44:24.790 --> 00:44:25.623
<v Speaker 2>quite a bit of experience now dealing </v>
<v Speaker 2>with hostile people and hostile press </v>

746
00:44:29.861 --> 00:44:31.730
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

747
00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:37.280
<v Speaker 2>I was able fortunately to stay detached </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

748
00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:38.863
<v Speaker 2>and with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with maybe with even with a bit of a </v>

749
00:44:41.521 --> 00:44:42.354
<v Speaker 2>sense of humor during the interview and </v>
<v Speaker 2>not take it personally and not get </v>

750
00:44:47.151 --> 00:44:47.984
<v Speaker 2>offended by it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though what was happening was </v>

751
00:44:49.311 --> 00:44:53.380
<v Speaker 2>deeply wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was an element of being able to be</v>

752
00:44:53.381 --> 00:44:56.260
<v Speaker 2>detached about it and that worked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

753
00:44:56.261 --> 00:44:59.800
<v Speaker 2>like I didn't really fight with her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't allow her to</v>

754
00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:03.980
<v Speaker 2>set the linguistic agenda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

755
00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:09.430
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't defend myself anymore than </v>
<v Speaker 2>was absolutely necessary.</v>

756
00:45:09.431 --> 00:45:10.264
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's minimal necessary for something </v>

757
00:45:11.861 --> 00:45:16.861
<v Speaker 2>like that and that was overwhelmingly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was overwhelmingly well received.</v>

758
00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:30.390
<v Speaker 1>When</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

759
00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:34.190
<v Speaker 1>you're in a public situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of a,</v>

760
00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:35.393
<v Speaker 1>it's a different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's different when you meet someone in </v>

761
00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:38.913
<v Speaker 1>streets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're one on one stuff to you or if </v>

762
00:45:42.541 --> 00:45:45.620
<v Speaker 1>you're at a dinner in a personal setting</v>
<v Speaker 1>or something,</v>

763
00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:50.360
<v Speaker 1>but when you're in a public setting it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically a,</v>

764
00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:52.613
<v Speaker 1>your receiving so you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be detached because it's not </v>

765
00:45:55.471 --> 00:46:00.180
<v Speaker 1>really the whole you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there an Avatar of yourself,</v>

766
00:46:00.220 --> 00:46:05.220
<v Speaker 1>a speaker or a role you inhabit so you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can have it,</v>

767
00:46:06.241 --> 00:46:08.430
<v Speaker 1>you can have patients,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not you,</v>

768
00:46:08.431 --> 00:46:09.060
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

769
00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:11.580
<v Speaker 1>but I mean as a person you don't have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take it.</v>

770
00:46:11.581 --> 00:46:13.750
<v Speaker 1>So personally I think people make that </v>
<v Speaker 1>mistake.</v>

771
00:46:15.820 --> 00:46:16.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's,</v>

772
00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:17.333
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing too is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not easy to know when you should </v>

773
00:46:19.391 --> 00:46:21.250
<v Speaker 2>take something personally and when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't.</v>

774
00:46:21.251 --> 00:46:26.251
<v Speaker 2>Like I didn't give you a good example of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that too from politics like years ago.</v>

775
00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:30.580
<v Speaker 2>Who was running for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was Mondale.</v>

776
00:46:30.970 --> 00:46:32.890
<v Speaker 2>I think so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might have this wrong,</v>

777
00:46:32.891 --> 00:46:37.891
<v Speaker 2>but he was um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was governor of Massachusetts now.</v>

778
00:46:38.461 --> 00:46:39.360
<v Speaker 2>Who was that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who?</v>

779
00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:43.560
<v Speaker 2>Who ran for governor of Massachusetts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

780
00:46:44.250 --> 00:46:48.250
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't Monday,</v>

781
00:46:48.270 --> 00:46:49.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't matter.</v>

782
00:46:49.870 --> 00:46:50.703
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was governor of Massachusetts and he </v>

783
00:46:51.931 --> 00:46:52.764
<v Speaker 2>had released a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a prisoner or or his or his prison </v>

784
00:46:56.521 --> 00:46:57.354
<v Speaker 2>system and released to prisoner who </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately raped someone and he was </v>

785
00:47:00.871 --> 00:47:03.630
<v Speaker 2>being raked over the coals on a TV show </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

786
00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:04.553
<v Speaker 2>about the fact that this has happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the rapist name was Willie </v>

787
00:47:07.710 --> 00:47:08.940
<v Speaker 2>Horton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I remember correctly.</v>

788
00:47:09.210 --> 00:47:10.043
<v Speaker 2>Dukakis was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was Dukakis when Dukakis was running </v>

789
00:47:12.781 --> 00:47:15.720
<v Speaker 2>for president and a journalist asked </v>
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>

790
00:47:15.721 --> 00:47:17.910
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how would you feel if,</v>

791
00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:19.513
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Willie Horton had raped your wife or </v>

792
00:47:21.681 --> 00:47:24.980
<v Speaker 2>your daughter and your CAC is gave a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

793
00:47:25.450 --> 00:47:29.900
<v Speaker 2>I would say placid answer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it,</v>

794
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:34.430
<v Speaker 2>it was one of the things that insured,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was not going to be elected president</v>

795
00:47:34.460 --> 00:47:35.293
<v Speaker 2>president.</v>

796
00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:36.343
<v Speaker 2>And what he should have said was my </v>
<v Speaker 2>imagination would immediately go to the </v>

797
00:47:40.851 --> 00:47:41.684
<v Speaker 2>darkest possible place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but because I'm a civilized person and </v>

798
00:47:45.871 --> 00:47:49.740
<v Speaker 2>understand that that pathway leads to </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing but may have,</v>

799
00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:51.873
<v Speaker 2>I'd be willing to let the legal system </v>
<v Speaker 2>take that moral obligation from my </v>

800
00:47:55.181 --> 00:47:59.380
<v Speaker 2>shoulders because otherwise everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>gets worse.</v>

801
00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:01.133
<v Speaker 2>That's the right response.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first response is mess with my </v>

802
00:48:05.361 --> 00:48:09.920
<v Speaker 2>family at your peril.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the second response is,</v>

803
00:48:10.490 --> 00:48:13.670
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't get to start a feud.</v>

804
00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:14.833
<v Speaker 2>I don't get to destabilize the entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>society in my pursuit of what you might </v>

805
00:48:18.891 --> 00:48:21.930
<v Speaker 2>regard as justifiable revenge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

806
00:48:22.580 --> 00:48:25.940
<v Speaker 2>And so that's part of that idea of </v>
<v Speaker 2>having a sword,</v>

807
00:48:25.941 --> 00:48:29.330
<v Speaker 2>but keeping it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's right and it is the opposite of,</v>

808
00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:32.750
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I talk about that in rule 11,</v>

809
00:48:33.470 --> 00:48:35.360
<v Speaker 2>don't bother their children were going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to skateboarding,</v>

810
00:48:35.361 --> 00:48:36.194
<v Speaker 2>which is in part a a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose a bit of a diatribe against </v>

811
00:48:39.651 --> 00:48:43.370
<v Speaker 2>the idea that the way that you make men </v>
<v Speaker 2>good is by making them weak.</v>

812
00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:49.420
<v Speaker 2>It's a really uninformed and and naive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uninformed and malicious idea.</v>

813
00:48:52.631 --> 00:48:54.310
<v Speaker 2>All of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At the same time,</v>

814
00:48:54.311 --> 00:48:55.144
<v Speaker 2>you make men good by making them </v>
<v Speaker 2>unbelievably strong and dangerous and </v>

815
00:48:59.291 --> 00:49:04.210
<v Speaker 2>then asking them politely to hold </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves in a band at all times</v>

816
00:49:07.710 --> 00:49:09.210
<v Speaker 1>dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just</v>

817
00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:14.190
<v Speaker 1>being strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something.</v>

818
00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:15.133
<v Speaker 1>If you are strong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have the capacity to be </v>

819
00:49:17.581 --> 00:49:18.530
<v Speaker 1>dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

820
00:49:19.250 --> 00:49:21.950
<v Speaker 1>Something separate from being strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

821
00:49:24.010 --> 00:49:24.843
<v Speaker 1>people have misinterpreted sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they heard you that they think </v>

822
00:49:28.810 --> 00:49:33.810
<v Speaker 1>you're calling for sort of the British,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hyper masculine men.</v>

823
00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:42.740
<v Speaker 1>But that's not what I heard you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard you say,</v>

824
00:49:42.741 --> 00:49:47.741
<v Speaker 1>is that if you have somebody who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>confident and strong in your convictions</v>

825
00:49:48.121 --> 00:49:52.010
<v Speaker 1>and you speak the truth and you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>afraid to,</v>

826
00:49:52.670 --> 00:49:53.503
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to protest when something is wrong and </v>

827
00:49:56.880 --> 00:50:01.740
<v Speaker 1>stand up for yourself and stand up for </v>
<v Speaker 1>people a week and then a protection,</v>

828
00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:05.940
<v Speaker 1>then you're strong and then you can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous.</v>

829
00:50:06.010 --> 00:50:08.400
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yes.</v>

830
00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:13.740
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

831
00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:18.750
<v Speaker 1>have you starting a testosterone or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something?</v>

832
00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:19.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure.</v>

833
00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:20.950
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

834
00:50:20.951 --> 00:50:24.100
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly for people who are afraid</v>

835
00:50:24.101 --> 00:50:24.934
<v Speaker 2>of who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for people who are afraid of or hate </v>

836
00:50:28.371 --> 00:50:32.210
<v Speaker 2>competence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like to confuse it with tyranny.</v>

837
00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:34.333
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mean Joe Rogan is kind of an </v>

838
00:50:36.621 --> 00:50:38.810
<v Speaker 2>interesting example in that regard </v>
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>

839
00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:39.733
<v Speaker 2>and so is this guy named Jocko willink </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's got an increasingly popular </v>

840
00:50:42.891 --> 00:50:45.770
<v Speaker 2>podcast and willing because he's a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>tough guy,</v>

841
00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:46.993
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's very physically intimidating and I </v>

842
00:50:49.161 --> 00:50:50.810
<v Speaker 2>would say psychologically intimidated</v>

843
00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:56.010
<v Speaker 1>comic book character looks and what he </v>
<v Speaker 1>has done in real life.</v>

844
00:50:56.620 --> 00:50:57.820
<v Speaker 2>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

845
00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:00.820
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's also that.</v>

846
00:51:00.821 --> 00:51:01.654
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's articulate and all of those things </v>

847
00:51:03.341 --> 00:51:04.174
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he told me quite clearly that he </v>

848
00:51:05.951 --> 00:51:09.520
<v Speaker 2>could have easily been like a hyper </v>
<v Speaker 2>delinquent when he was a kid,</v>

849
00:51:09.521 --> 00:51:11.110
<v Speaker 2>but decided that he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he's,</v>

850
00:51:11.250 --> 00:51:11.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

851
00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:15.340
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's an aggressive guy and he decided he</v>

852
00:51:15.341 --> 00:51:16.174
<v Speaker 2>was going to be a good person instead </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can't be a good person without </v>

853
00:51:20.501 --> 00:51:23.470
<v Speaker 2>the capacity for malevolence </v>
<v Speaker 2>interestingly enough.</v>

854
00:51:23.471 --> 00:51:24.304
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's one of the reasons if you </v>

855
00:51:26.141 --> 00:51:28.850
<v Speaker 2>think about it metaphysically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>

856
00:51:28.851 --> 00:51:30.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one question is always be,</v>

857
00:51:30.471 --> 00:51:31.100
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

858
00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:31.933
<v Speaker 2>Why is there evil in the world?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean this is only a partial </v>

859
00:51:34.731 --> 00:51:35.564
<v Speaker 2>answer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's possible that you cannot fully </v>

860
00:51:38.121 --> 00:51:38.954
<v Speaker 2>develop your capacity for good without </v>
<v Speaker 2>also developing your capacity for evil </v>

861
00:51:43.310 --> 00:51:46.600
<v Speaker 2>because you have to be able to do things</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if you will do them.</v>

862
00:51:47.490 --> 00:51:50.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if it's a matter of learning how to</v>

863
00:51:50.121 --> 00:51:50.954
<v Speaker 2>withstand temptation and until you're in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a position where that temptation is </v>

864
00:51:54.021 --> 00:51:56.420
<v Speaker 2>real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not withstanding anything.</v>

865
00:51:57.890 --> 00:51:58.723
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're not sleeping with 100 women a </v>

866
00:52:00.891 --> 00:52:03.170
<v Speaker 2>year because they're not lining up to </v>
<v Speaker 2>sleep with you,</v>

867
00:52:03.171 --> 00:52:05.900
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't make you moral.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just makes you undesirable.</v>

868
00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:10.793
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also think this is perhaps one of the </v>

869
00:52:16.661 --> 00:52:21.661
<v Speaker 1>reasons that the bad guys or so</v>
<v Speaker 1>or so</v>

870
00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:29.090
<v Speaker 1>people want to be the bad guy and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>band guys.</v>

871
00:52:29.091 --> 00:52:29.924
<v Speaker 1>Interesting in movies and</v>
<v Speaker 1>TV series and also this is part of the </v>

872
00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:40.890
<v Speaker 1>is actually a part of Christianity which</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think is very interesting,</v>

873
00:52:40.891 --> 00:52:45.891
<v Speaker 1>is that the protocol sheet returning to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the herb and the protocol and and you,</v>

874
00:52:49.111 --> 00:52:49.944
<v Speaker 1>you find that in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most awful criminal who's starting </v>

875
00:52:55.051 --> 00:52:55.884
<v Speaker 1>to have doubts then that's an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a great one of the best </v>

876
00:52:58.411 --> 00:53:01.090
<v Speaker 1>characters in movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the,</v>

877
00:53:01.530 --> 00:53:02.363
<v Speaker 1>the awful villain who's having second </v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts and then in the end turns out </v>

878
00:53:05.890 --> 00:53:07.630
<v Speaker 1>to have a heart of gold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

879
00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:08.580
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

880
00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:12.660
<v Speaker 1>But if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you are the lamb that's much more,</v>

881
00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:14.660
<v Speaker 1>that's a boring movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

882
00:53:14.940 --> 00:53:19.940
<v Speaker 1>like the lamb who's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's never done anything wrong.</v>

883
00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:23.610
<v Speaker 1>You can't because you can't.</v>

884
00:53:24.090 --> 00:53:24.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well there's an.</v>

885
00:53:25.710 --> 00:53:29.490
<v Speaker 2>There's an interesting scene in </v>
<v Speaker 2>revelation in revelation,</v>

886
00:53:29.491 --> 00:53:31.890
<v Speaker 2>which is a very strange book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a hallucinogenic.</v>

887
00:53:31.980 --> 00:53:34.020
<v Speaker 2>It's like a hallucinogenic trip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

888
00:53:34.021 --> 00:53:36.270
<v Speaker 2>I think it probably is a hallucinogenic </v>
<v Speaker 2>trip.</v>

889
00:53:36.690 --> 00:53:40.530
<v Speaker 2>That's my suspicions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Christ comes back with a sword in his</v>

890
00:53:40.531 --> 00:53:45.180
<v Speaker 2>mouth and he judges humanity and so he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>very merciful in the gospels,</v>

891
00:53:45.181 --> 00:53:47.490
<v Speaker 2>but in revelation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the ultimate judge.</v>

892
00:53:47.491 --> 00:53:50.970
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that is that any </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideal is a judge,</v>

893
00:53:51.090 --> 00:53:53.610
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you hold something up as an ideal,</v>

894
00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:58.820
<v Speaker 2>then you are reflected poorly in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mirror of that ideal.</v>

895
00:53:58.951 --> 00:54:03.951
<v Speaker 2>So it's instantly a judge and there are </v>
<v Speaker 2>far more damage than saved in,</v>

896
00:54:04.961 --> 00:54:06.660
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the revelation story.</v>

897
00:54:07.170 --> 00:54:09.330
<v Speaker 2>But Christ tells people when he judges </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

898
00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:10.890
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

899
00:54:11.580 --> 00:54:12.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm paraphrasing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

900
00:54:12.810 --> 00:54:14.610
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the meaning is,</v>

901
00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:16.320
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is appropriate.</v>

902
00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:19.170
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're hot,</v>

903
00:54:19.470 --> 00:54:22.140
<v Speaker 2>that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's commendable.</v>

904
00:54:22.141 --> 00:54:24.750
<v Speaker 2>If you're cold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's okay.</v>

905
00:54:25.050 --> 00:54:28.170
<v Speaker 2>But if you're lukewarm then I'll vomit </v>
<v Speaker 2>you out of my mouth.</v>

906
00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:31.430
<v Speaker 2>That's the line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's so interesting because it,</v>

907
00:54:31.490 --> 00:54:32.161
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

908
00:54:32.161 --> 00:54:34.500
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an echo of what you just described,</v>

909
00:54:34.540 --> 00:54:37.770
<v Speaker 2>is there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is no virtue in,</v>

910
00:54:38.020 --> 00:54:40.470
<v Speaker 2>in non commitment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

911
00:54:40.580 --> 00:54:45.020
<v Speaker 2>There is no virtue in week harmlessness </v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact it.</v>

912
00:54:45.380 --> 00:54:46.930
<v Speaker 2>And you see that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean when,</v>

913
00:54:46.931 --> 00:54:49.070
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when Hannah wrote,</v>

914
00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:53.300
<v Speaker 2>wrote her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her book on Eichmann in Jerusalem,</v>

915
00:54:53.301 --> 00:54:55.850
<v Speaker 2>it's Eichmann in Jerusalem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe the banality of evil.</v>

916
00:54:57.030 --> 00:54:57.863
<v Speaker 2>She talked about Eichmann and Eichmann </v>
<v Speaker 2>was one of these characters who was a </v>

917
00:55:00.451 --> 00:55:02.470
<v Speaker 2>lamb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

918
00:55:02.471 --> 00:55:03.310
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

919
00:55:03.370 --> 00:55:05.200
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't,</v>

920
00:55:05.470 --> 00:55:06.303
<v Speaker 2>you're spectacular cartoon book villain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was the harmless kind of soft guy </v>

921
00:55:12.471 --> 00:55:13.304
<v Speaker 2>next door who sort of went along to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>along and he happened to be in a </v>

922
00:55:17.061 --> 00:55:19.940
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy where the goal was to </v>
<v Speaker 2>eradicate the Jews.</v>

923
00:55:19.941 --> 00:55:24.400
<v Speaker 2>But who is he to question the hierarchy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one.</v>

924
00:55:24.401 --> 00:55:27.860
<v Speaker 2>So she titled Her Book The banality of </v>
<v Speaker 2>evil.</v>

925
00:55:27.861 --> 00:55:29.990
<v Speaker 2>And I always thought she had the titled </v>
<v Speaker 2>Backwards.</v>

926
00:55:29.991 --> 00:55:31.970
<v Speaker 2>It should have been the evil of </v>
<v Speaker 2>banality.</v>

927
00:55:37.260 --> 00:55:38.093
<v Speaker 1>I haven't thought of that.</v>

928
00:55:41.870 --> 00:55:43.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a deep thought.</v>

929
00:55:47.390 --> 00:55:49.790
<v Speaker 1>I've read a couple of Christian </v>
<v Speaker 1>critique.</v>

930
00:55:49.791 --> 00:55:51.270
<v Speaker 1>So your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

931
00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:54.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your thoughts and your,</v>

932
00:55:55.070 --> 00:55:58.450
<v Speaker 1>your book and one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

933
00:55:58.610 --> 00:55:59.443
<v Speaker 1>one of the critiques was that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think that because people have </v>

934
00:56:05.991 --> 00:56:10.040
<v Speaker 1>within their grasp to do good and evil </v>
<v Speaker 1>by themselves,</v>

935
00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:12.233
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your committing to a Christian heresy </v>

936
00:56:14.031 --> 00:56:15.290
<v Speaker 1>called pelagianism.</v>

937
00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:17.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

938
00:56:17.001 --> 00:56:20.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't really believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really believe that,</v>

939
00:56:20.810 --> 00:56:21.770
<v Speaker 2>but it's very difficult</v>

940
00:56:22.900 --> 00:56:23.733
<v Speaker 1>because eastern orthodoxy then you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>only do good because of our sinful </v>

941
00:56:29.111 --> 00:56:29.944
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can only do good by the grace of </v>

942
00:56:31.481 --> 00:56:33.750
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we are,</v>

943
00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:37.360
<v Speaker 1>if we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we are not sinful in our nature,</v>

944
00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:40.870
<v Speaker 1>if we deny that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we are basically,</v>

945
00:56:40.871 --> 00:56:41.704
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

946
00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:43.170
<v Speaker 1>having,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

947
00:56:44.090 --> 00:56:48.570
<v Speaker 1>committing vanity because we think we </v>
<v Speaker 1>are so struck by that,</v>

948
00:56:49.580 --> 00:56:52.570
<v Speaker 1>that that's a claim that I've seen being</v>
<v Speaker 1>thrown</v>

949
00:56:54.190 --> 00:56:55.023
<v Speaker 1>a critique that I was a thought that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>would like to hear you respond to them </v>

950
00:56:59.711 --> 00:57:00.544
<v Speaker 1>because</v>

951
00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:05.130
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an unbelievably deep problem.</v>

952
00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:07.073
<v Speaker 2>So the first thing I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can only speak metaphorically about </v>

953
00:57:11.101 --> 00:57:11.934
<v Speaker 2>such things in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I would say the Christian claim is </v>

954
00:57:15.181 --> 00:57:20.181
<v Speaker 2>that Christ's sacrifice redeemed us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I would say that's true,</v>

955
00:57:22.100 --> 00:57:26.050
<v Speaker 2>but we still have to do the work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might say,</v>

956
00:57:26.051 --> 00:57:28.420
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can both of those things be the case</v>

957
00:57:28.421 --> 00:57:30.850
<v Speaker 2>simultaneously?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the answer is,</v>

958
00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:34.950
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it depends on your view of time.</v>

959
00:57:37.110 --> 00:57:40.640
<v Speaker 2>So and I can't explain it any deeper </v>
<v Speaker 2>than that,</v>

960
00:57:41.020 --> 00:57:43.640
<v Speaker 2>so I'm not going to because it would </v>
<v Speaker 2>take forever.</v>

961
00:57:43.641 --> 00:57:48.350
<v Speaker 2>But I would also say I do believe that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you should step forward to do good.</v>

962
00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:49.273
<v Speaker 2>Humbly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do believe that if you're going to </v>

963
00:57:51.441 --> 00:57:52.274
<v Speaker 2>step forward to do good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you should do it well guided by </v>

964
00:57:54.411 --> 00:57:56.390
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the divine images.</v>

965
00:57:58.570 --> 00:58:02.870
<v Speaker 2>I do believe that you're likely to err </v>
<v Speaker 2>in your judgment of what's good,</v>

966
00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:03.913
<v Speaker 2>which is why I entitled the chapter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't tell the truth or at least don't </v>

967
00:58:07.341 --> 00:58:08.174
<v Speaker 2>lie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It isn't obvious to me that you can </v>

968
00:58:09.471 --> 00:58:10.304
<v Speaker 2>discern the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is obvious to me that sometimes </v>

969
00:58:13.191 --> 00:58:17.660
<v Speaker 2>you know when you're lying and you could</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop doing that.</v>

970
00:58:19.220 --> 00:58:23.290
<v Speaker 2>And so I think that those critiques are </v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

971
00:58:23.291 --> 00:58:24.124
<v Speaker 2>but then I would also invert the </v>
<v Speaker 2>criticism and I would say that part of </v>

972
00:58:26.621 --> 00:58:30.640
<v Speaker 2>the danger of modern western </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christianity in particular.</v>

973
00:58:30.641 --> 00:58:31.474
<v Speaker 2>I don't think this is quite the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the Orthodox Christian types is </v>

974
00:58:34.661 --> 00:58:39.661
<v Speaker 2>that by assuming that everything good is</v>
<v Speaker 2>done by the grace of God,</v>

975
00:58:40.660 --> 00:58:44.050
<v Speaker 2>you reduce the burden of the imitation </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Christ.</v>

976
00:58:44.740 --> 00:58:47.710
<v Speaker 2>The question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does it mean to believe in Christ?</v>

977
00:58:48.280 --> 00:58:52.300
<v Speaker 2>Let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and one answer to that would be to say,</v>

978
00:58:52.510 --> 00:58:57.070
<v Speaker 2>I regard this statement that Christ's </v>
<v Speaker 2>crucifixion redeemed me.</v>

979
00:58:58.360 --> 00:59:01.660
<v Speaker 2>I regard that statement as true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say I'm a Christian.</v>

980
00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:03.280
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's one definition.</v>

981
00:59:03.490 --> 00:59:04.323
<v Speaker 2>Here's another definition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pick up your cross and walk up the </v>

982
00:59:07.751 --> 00:59:12.751
<v Speaker 2>Goddamn hill and that's the proper </v>
<v Speaker 2>definition as far as I'm concerned.</v>

983
00:59:13.130 --> 00:59:16.580
<v Speaker 2>And so and this is a nichey and critic </v>
<v Speaker 2>criticism of,</v>

984
00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:20.610
<v Speaker 2>of institutionalized Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that it lifts,</v>

985
00:59:20.630 --> 00:59:21.463
<v Speaker 2>it made moral board burden to light </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the burden is supposed to be </v>

986
00:59:26.740 --> 00:59:27.573
<v Speaker 2>confront evil constraint in your own </v>
<v Speaker 2>heart except the tragedy of being pick </v>

987
00:59:32.650 --> 00:59:35.610
<v Speaker 2>up the load of mortality and walk up </v>
<v Speaker 2>hill.</v>

988
00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:36.593
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

989
00:59:36.810 --> 00:59:40.020
<v Speaker 2>that's rough man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So and then young wrote about that,</v>

990
00:59:40.021 --> 00:59:40.854
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he was interested in the </v>

991
00:59:41.971 --> 00:59:43.680
<v Speaker 2>Nietzschean critique and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

992
00:59:43.710 --> 00:59:44.543
<v Speaker 2>you got to understand that you can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>cynical about the Catholics and their </v>

993
00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:51.960
<v Speaker 2>idea that you've been redeemed by an </v>
<v Speaker 2>external source.</v>

994
00:59:51.961 --> 00:59:52.794
<v Speaker 2>Say it's not that it's not precisely </v>
<v Speaker 2>that clear will parody a bit for the </v>

995
00:59:55.621 --> 00:59:58.410
<v Speaker 2>sake of argument and maybe you can also </v>
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>

996
00:59:59.010 --> 01:00:03.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm cynical about the idea that you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>go in and confess and receive absolution</v>

997
01:00:03.811 --> 01:00:07.920
<v Speaker 2>and walk out sin free,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have to understand is the church</v>

998
01:00:07.921 --> 01:00:08.754
<v Speaker 2>is somewhat merciful and its endeavors </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's trying to also free people </v>

999
01:00:13.081 --> 01:00:16.530
<v Speaker 2>from the intolerable consciousness of </v>
<v Speaker 2>their own insufficiency.</v>

1000
01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:18.890
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause I couldn't say to you,</v>

1001
01:00:18.891 --> 01:00:19.724
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to bear the weight of all your </v>

1002
01:00:20.751 --> 01:00:24.470
<v Speaker 2>transgressions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like Jesus really with no mercy.</v>

1003
01:00:24.471 --> 01:00:27.350
<v Speaker 2>That's how we're going to play this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who could tolerate that?</v>

1004
01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:29.930
<v Speaker 2>And the Catholics at least say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well look,</v>

1005
01:00:29.931 --> 01:00:30.764
<v Speaker 2>you're fallible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to make all sorts of </v>

1006
01:00:31.821 --> 01:00:34.250
<v Speaker 2>mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to happen over and over.</v>

1007
01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.600
<v Speaker 2>At least can go in and have the burden </v>
<v Speaker 2>lifted from time to time.</v>

1008
01:00:38.601 --> 01:00:39.434
<v Speaker 2>You're supposed to play it straight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're supposed to go in and actually </v>

1009
01:00:41.421 --> 01:00:44.780
<v Speaker 2>confess and repent and try to do better </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the future,</v>

1010
01:00:45.110 --> 01:00:45.943
<v Speaker 2>but at least you don't have to drag your</v>
<v Speaker 2>catastrophic cell past self along with </v>

1011
01:00:49.701 --> 01:00:54.510
<v Speaker 2>you every step of the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

1012
01:00:54.511 --> 01:00:58.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm not trying to elevate human beings </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the status of demi gods,</v>

1013
01:00:58.511 --> 01:00:59.344
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I guess I am suggesting that we can </v>

1014
01:01:01.801 --> 01:01:02.634
<v Speaker 2>at least participate in that to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>degree that we're willing to hoist our </v>

1015
01:01:06.601 --> 01:01:07.434
<v Speaker 2>own burdens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I do think we should do that with </v>

1016
01:01:09.301 --> 01:01:13.230
<v Speaker 2>humility and without thinking that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>can see the way forward.</v>

1017
01:01:13.231 --> 01:01:14.064
<v Speaker 2>So clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do think we can walk away from </v>

1018
01:01:17.171 --> 01:01:18.070
<v Speaker 2>Auschwitz though.</v>

1019
01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:20.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so too.</v>

1020
01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:24.913
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1021
01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:26.410
<v Speaker 1>this was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1022
01:01:26.450 --> 01:01:29.450
<v Speaker 1>this has been a recurring question for </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1023
01:01:29.810 --> 01:01:32.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure if I asked you the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>time really</v>

1024
01:01:34.010 --> 01:01:39.010
<v Speaker 1>it's about truth and how you return to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Christianity.</v>

1025
01:01:41.330 --> 01:01:43.740
<v Speaker 1>Some parts of Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This has been true.</v>

1026
01:01:43.950 --> 01:01:46.970
<v Speaker 1>You said like the truth of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual,</v>

1027
01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:49.620
<v Speaker 1>I think you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how.</v>

1028
01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:54.710
<v Speaker 1>My question is how can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can be true and,</v>

1029
01:01:54.970 --> 01:01:59.210
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four for cs Lewis when he,</v>

1030
01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:03.800
<v Speaker 1>when he started like accepted that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity was true for him,</v>

1031
01:02:04.130 --> 01:02:09.130
<v Speaker 1>it was like a mixture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a talked into it by talking and I</v>

1032
01:02:09.890 --> 01:02:14.890
<v Speaker 1>don't remember that guy's name with one </v>
<v Speaker 1>other friend and he said the combination</v>

1033
01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:21.160
<v Speaker 1>of a myth or a dying God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he always loved the dying like diagnosis</v>

1034
01:02:23.810 --> 01:02:26.710
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1035
01:02:26.740 --> 01:02:27.573
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in Christ it company combining the </v>

1036
01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:33.590
<v Speaker 1>dying God wrote with an actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>historical figure.</v>

1037
01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:37.730
<v Speaker 1>He actually set that this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just a myth.</v>

1038
01:02:37.731 --> 01:02:42.110
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's true because it's also historical.</v>

1039
01:02:42.260 --> 01:02:45.680
<v Speaker 1>And then he said that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you distinguished.</v>

1040
01:02:45.910 --> 01:02:46.743
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you watch from the outside and </v>

1041
01:02:48.321 --> 01:02:51.410
<v Speaker 1>analyze it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well of course you can see that it's,</v>

1042
01:02:51.940 --> 01:02:56.940
<v Speaker 1>it's just so you can see similarities as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a scientist,</v>

1043
01:02:57.560 --> 01:02:59.990
<v Speaker 1>but from the inside because if the </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>

1044
01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:03.120
<v Speaker 1>And so that was his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his view of it.</v>

1045
01:03:03.860 --> 01:03:08.380
<v Speaker 2>Here's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the strange possibility.</v>

1046
01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:09.873
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that's happened to me </v>
<v Speaker 2>as I've delved farther and farther into </v>

1047
01:03:12.431 --> 01:03:13.264
<v Speaker 2>religious stories is that I've found </v>
<v Speaker 2>continually that their depth is </v>

1048
01:03:16.961 --> 01:03:17.794
<v Speaker 2>inexhaustible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And at some point it becomes less </v>

1049
01:03:22.031 --> 01:03:22.864
<v Speaker 2>impossible that they're true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it is impossible that they're not </v>

1050
01:03:25.691 --> 01:03:28.030
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something like that now,</v>

1051
01:03:28.210 --> 01:03:31.040
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now I'm not.</v>

1052
01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:32.650
<v Speaker 2>So there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are,</v>

1053
01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:33.753
<v Speaker 2>there are truths in genesis that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>unfathomably deep now and I've outlined </v>

1054
01:03:40.031 --> 01:03:43.120
<v Speaker 2>them to the best of my ability in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>biblical series that I did.</v>

1055
01:03:43.121 --> 01:03:45.610
<v Speaker 2>Now I don't know how to reconcile those </v>
<v Speaker 2>truths with,</v>

1056
01:03:46.180 --> 01:03:47.013
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

1057
01:03:47.260 --> 01:03:50.710
<v Speaker 2>with the scientific view of the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the view,</v>

1058
01:03:50.940 --> 01:03:55.940
<v Speaker 2>the fact that the universe is 14 billion</v>
<v Speaker 2>years old and that we've crawled our way</v>

1059
01:03:57.131 --> 01:03:57.964
<v Speaker 2>up from the sludge and the mod.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how those things coexist </v>

1060
01:04:02.081 --> 01:04:02.914
<v Speaker 2>precisely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that there are truths that guide </v>

1061
01:04:06.161 --> 01:04:09.670
<v Speaker 2>behavior and there are truths that </v>
<v Speaker 2>describe the material world,</v>

1062
01:04:10.210 --> 01:04:11.043
<v Speaker 2>but I certainly don't think that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>truth that we have that described the </v>

1063
01:04:13.391 --> 01:04:15.280
<v Speaker 2>material world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our final truths,</v>

1064
01:04:15.281 --> 01:04:18.130
<v Speaker 2>because I don't think our material is </v>
<v Speaker 2>few point is accurate.</v>

1065
01:04:18.370 --> 01:04:20.560
<v Speaker 2>It's accurate for some purposes </v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously.</v>

1066
01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:23.400
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I am a practicing scientist and,</v>

1067
01:04:23.460 --> 01:04:25.420
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uninformed one,</v>

1068
01:04:25.421 --> 01:04:26.910
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1069
01:04:27.130 --> 01:04:31.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe that people act as if </v>
<v Speaker 2>they confronted material reality.</v>

1070
01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:32.433
<v Speaker 2>I believe that people act as if they </v>
<v Speaker 2>confront and infinite realm of </v>

1071
01:04:34.991 --> 01:04:35.824
<v Speaker 2>possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one pole of which is having and the </v>

1072
01:04:37.541 --> 01:04:38.374
<v Speaker 2>other pole of which is held and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe that we treat each other as if </v>

1073
01:04:42.671 --> 01:04:43.504
<v Speaker 2>that's the world that we live in because</v>
<v Speaker 2>we upgrade each other for not upholding </v>

1074
01:04:47.231 --> 01:04:48.064
<v Speaker 2>our moral duty and we understand what </v>
<v Speaker 2>that means and we upgrade ourselves for </v>

1075
01:04:52.091 --> 01:04:52.924
<v Speaker 2>being less than we could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so we confront a world of potential </v>

1076
01:04:57.100 --> 01:04:57.933
<v Speaker 2>and we don't have a good model for that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the mythological descriptions </v>

1077
01:05:00.910 --> 01:05:05.910
<v Speaker 2>describe the human being as the eternal </v>
<v Speaker 2>confronter have a world of potential and</v>

1078
01:05:06.341 --> 01:05:08.110
<v Speaker 2>there's something about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's accurate.</v>

1079
01:05:08.860 --> 01:05:09.693
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with regards to this Christian stories </v>

1080
01:05:11.071 --> 01:05:11.904
<v Speaker 2>specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do think the idea that that eternal </v>

1081
01:05:14.351 --> 01:05:15.184
<v Speaker 2>myth was made historically concrete is </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things about Christianity </v>

1082
01:05:18.761 --> 01:05:20.680
<v Speaker 2>that's unalterably powerful.</v>

1083
01:05:21.430 --> 01:05:22.263
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the limits are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's say that what you're called </v>

1084
01:05:26.301 --> 01:05:27.134
<v Speaker 2>upon to do until in life is to open </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself up to the tragedy of being </v>

1085
01:05:31.130 --> 01:05:33.200
<v Speaker 2>completely to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To accept it,</v>

1086
01:05:33.410 --> 01:05:35.720
<v Speaker 2>to welcome it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even even to love it.</v>

1087
01:05:35.721 --> 01:05:36.554
<v Speaker 2>If you can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's no easy thing you watched </v>

1088
01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:43.130
<v Speaker 2>Iraq being invaded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no easy way of loving.</v>

1089
01:05:43.131 --> 01:05:43.964
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no easy way of saying yes to </v>

1090
01:05:45.171 --> 01:05:48.600
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but your job in some sense as a,</v>

1091
01:05:48.900 --> 01:05:49.733
<v Speaker 2>as a incarnated finite creature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to say yes to the possibilities of </v>

1092
01:05:54.261 --> 01:05:57.050
<v Speaker 2>being in every possible way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question is,</v>

1093
01:05:57.051 --> 01:05:58.610
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the upper limit to that?</v>

1094
01:05:58.611 --> 01:05:59.444
<v Speaker 2>Like what are the transformations that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are possible as a consequence of doing </v>

1095
01:06:02.691 --> 01:06:05.300
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the answer to that is we don't know.</v>

1096
01:06:05.301 --> 01:06:06.134
<v Speaker 2>The Christian story is in part an </v>
<v Speaker 2>investigation of that is if you're </v>

1097
01:06:08.931 --> 01:06:09.764
<v Speaker 2>willing to accept your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're willing to accept the </v>

1098
01:06:13.911 --> 01:06:17.480
<v Speaker 2>brutality of the mob,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the betrayal of your friends,</v>

1099
01:06:18.110 --> 01:06:21.710
<v Speaker 2>the torture of your existence and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>unjust death.</v>

1100
01:06:22.910 --> 01:06:25.820
<v Speaker 2>If you're willing to accept that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>welcome it,</v>

1101
01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:29.540
<v Speaker 2>what happens to you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the answer is</v>

1102
01:06:31.270 --> 01:06:36.270
<v Speaker 2>try it and find out</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the</v>

1103
01:06:38.750 --> 01:06:41.320
<v Speaker 2>scenario though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1104
01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:42.750
<v Speaker 2>you did that in part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1105
01:06:42.751 --> 01:06:43.740
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you were,</v>

1106
01:06:44.070 --> 01:06:47.490
<v Speaker 2>when you decided to immerse yourself in </v>
<v Speaker 2>what was happening in Iraq,</v>

1107
01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:49.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could have looked away.</v>

1108
01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:51.633
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1109
01:06:52.310 --> 01:06:56.060
<v Speaker 1>Four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I often find that the,</v>

1110
01:06:56.110 --> 01:06:56.800
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1111
01:06:56.800 --> 01:07:01.800
<v Speaker 1>my role as a journalist or I'm not a </v>
<v Speaker 1>real journalist,</v>

1112
01:07:02.431 --> 01:07:04.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm more like an editor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm an editorial right,</v>

1113
01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:09.280
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's sort of a missed between me and</v>

1114
01:07:09.281 --> 01:07:10.950
<v Speaker 1>some reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I could,</v>

1115
01:07:10.990 --> 01:07:13.130
<v Speaker 1>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can do it as a</v>

1116
01:07:13.740 --> 01:07:14.880
<v Speaker 2>take on my,</v>

1117
01:07:15.690 --> 01:07:19.470
<v Speaker 1>my jackets and then I watched the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality through that Lens.</v>

1118
01:07:20.650 --> 01:07:23.880
<v Speaker 1>So it sort of shields me from some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of it.</v>

1119
01:07:23.881 --> 01:07:24.714
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

1120
01:07:24.810 --> 01:07:25.643
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the advantage of having a </v>

1121
01:07:26.771 --> 01:07:30.570
<v Speaker 2>well developed persona from the union </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective.</v>

1122
01:07:31.110 --> 01:07:33.010
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you put on an image like,</v>

1123
01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:36.720
<v Speaker 2>like Clark Kent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Superman puts on Clark Kent.</v>

1124
01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:40.950
<v Speaker 2>That's why superheroes always having a </v>
<v Speaker 2>normative alter ego,</v>

1125
01:07:41.610 --> 01:07:42.443
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to be able to live in the </v>

1126
01:07:43.141 --> 01:07:44.280
<v Speaker 2>normal world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1127
01:07:44.281 --> 01:07:47.010
<v Speaker 2>So you need to have an element of </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself that can,</v>

1128
01:07:47.550 --> 01:07:50.760
<v Speaker 2>that can exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1129
01:07:50.761 --> 01:07:53.190
<v Speaker 2>they can act as a mask between you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

1130
01:07:53.191 --> 01:07:55.920
<v Speaker 2>I suppose that's what a persona is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1131
01:07:55.921 --> 01:07:59.310
<v Speaker 2>but I mean to the degree that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to open your eyes,</v>

1132
01:07:59.730 --> 01:08:00.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>neat.</v>

1133
01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:01.333
<v Speaker 2>You also said you could determine the </v>
<v Speaker 2>depth of a man's character by observing </v>

1134
01:08:05.401 --> 01:08:10.250
<v Speaker 2>how much truth he's willing to tolerate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1135
01:08:10.330 --> 01:08:11.170
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is,</v>

1136
01:08:11.470 --> 01:08:12.161
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think,</v>

1137
01:08:12.161 --> 01:08:15.010
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can that be associated with the idea</v>

1138
01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:17.150
<v Speaker 2>of the truth will set you free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1139
01:08:17.151 --> 01:08:18.260
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might set you free,</v>

1140
01:08:18.261 --> 01:08:21.200
<v Speaker 2>but it will take you places you're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>sure you want to go first.</v>

1141
01:08:22.930 --> 01:08:23.763
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the movie matrix when neo wakes up </v>

1142
01:08:31.651 --> 01:08:36.651
<v Speaker 1>and he's flushed down the drain pipe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>woken up to this awful,</v>

1143
01:08:38.490 --> 01:08:40.230
<v Speaker 1>awful world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's reality.</v>

1144
01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:46.080
<v Speaker 1>That's the truth of the underworld</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's an old truth.</v>

1145
01:08:49.340 --> 01:08:53.430
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully the truth is not all the time.</v>

1146
01:08:54.010 --> 01:08:54.491
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1147
01:08:54.491 --> 01:08:55.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an old.</v>

1148
01:08:55.450 --> 01:08:56.283
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the funny thing is that there's an old </v>

1149
01:08:57.850 --> 01:09:00.280
<v Speaker 2>Christian idea too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that when Christ was crucified,</v>

1150
01:09:00.281 --> 01:09:02.680
<v Speaker 2>he went and harrowed hell before he rose</v>
<v Speaker 2>to heaven.</v>

1151
01:09:03.100 --> 01:09:07.060
<v Speaker 2>It's like there is this idea that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't go up without going down.</v>

1152
01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:11.500
<v Speaker 2>And I really do believe that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that maybe see,</v>

1153
01:09:12.370 --> 01:09:13.203
<v Speaker 2>one of the images in genesis that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>really hard to understand is that when </v>

1154
01:09:15.911 --> 01:09:16.744
<v Speaker 2>God throws Adam and Eve out of paradise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he puts an angel at the gates of </v>

1155
01:09:21.431 --> 01:09:25.840
<v Speaker 2>Paradise with with flaming swords to </v>
<v Speaker 2>borrow the way you might think,</v>

1156
01:09:25.841 --> 01:09:26.674
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would God bar the way to paradise </v>

1157
01:09:28.811 --> 01:09:33.340
<v Speaker 2>with with flaming swords?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And maybe the flaming swords cut all the</v>

1158
01:09:33.341 --> 01:09:35.830
<v Speaker 2>dead wood off before you step through </v>
<v Speaker 2>the gate.</v>

1159
01:09:36.220 --> 01:09:38.590
<v Speaker 2>And if you're all dead wood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then there's nothing left of you.</v>

1160
01:09:38.591 --> 01:09:43.450
<v Speaker 2>Once the flaming swords are done with </v>
<v Speaker 2>you and to observe what you observe with</v>

1161
01:09:43.451 --> 01:09:46.060
<v Speaker 2>the Iraq invasion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a set of flaming swords.</v>

1162
01:09:46.061 --> 01:09:46.894
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because what you're watching is what </v>

1163
01:09:47.831 --> 01:09:50.680
<v Speaker 2>human beings are like and you happen to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be one.</v>

1164
01:09:50.980 --> 01:09:54.220
<v Speaker 2>And to the degree that you're like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's you doing that.</v>

1165
01:09:54.940 --> 01:09:58.240
<v Speaker 2>That's a hell of a thing too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a hell of a thing to realize.</v>

1166
01:09:58.270 --> 01:09:58.781
<v Speaker 2>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1167
01:09:58.781 --> 01:10:01.060
<v Speaker 2>what's the right response to watching </v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

1168
01:10:01.061 --> 01:10:06.061
<v Speaker 2>And I would say to stop being an evil </v>
<v Speaker 2>person and now it's no simple thing.</v>

1169
01:10:07.540 --> 01:10:08.373
<v Speaker 1>One of the things with these people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>met goes there and during the Icelandic </v>

1170
01:10:12.630 --> 01:10:15.870
<v Speaker 1>state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're evil,</v>

1171
01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:20.690
<v Speaker 1>they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them are evil.</v>

1172
01:10:20.830 --> 01:10:21.663
<v Speaker 1>Of course they are psychopaths and are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you are a psychopath and you </v>

1173
01:10:25.740 --> 01:10:26.573
<v Speaker 1>really want to do violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a great place to be and you can </v>

1174
01:10:29.711 --> 01:10:30.544
<v Speaker 1>probably do great there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there are also people joining the </v>

1175
01:10:34.020 --> 01:10:35.160
<v Speaker 1>error.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

1176
01:10:35.170 --> 01:10:36.003
<v Speaker 1>They want to do good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just really a really twisted sense </v>

1177
01:10:39.691 --> 01:10:40.524
<v Speaker 1>of what's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the most depressing </v>

1178
01:10:43.411 --> 01:10:44.690
<v Speaker 1>things about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1179
01:10:44.730 --> 01:10:48.100
<v Speaker 1>Islamic state is that some of the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that go there,</v>

1180
01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:49.993
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do horrible things and then they </v>

1181
01:10:52.660 --> 01:10:54.790
<v Speaker 1>regret themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

1182
01:10:55.090 --> 01:10:58.900
<v Speaker 1>how could you let them back into society</v>
<v Speaker 1>after what they've done?</v>

1183
01:10:59.610 --> 01:11:00.443
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1184
01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:03.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1185
01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:08.060
<v Speaker 1>so it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>the power of ideas is you can,</v>

1186
01:11:08.061 --> 01:11:13.061
<v Speaker 1>you can convert people that under others</v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances would have done,</v>

1187
01:11:13.550 --> 01:11:14.383
<v Speaker 1>done good.</v>

1188
01:11:15.940 --> 01:11:18.710
<v Speaker 2>The tools so evil and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1189
01:11:18.940 --> 01:11:22.770
<v Speaker 2>this is partly why I tried in some sense</v>
<v Speaker 2>are allowed,</v>

1190
01:11:22.950 --> 01:11:23.783
<v Speaker 2>in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>12 rules and my lectures as well to be </v>

1191
01:11:26.071 --> 01:11:26.904
<v Speaker 2>so harsh because imagine that there are </v>
<v Speaker 2>many young men who are looking for an </v>

1192
01:11:30.211 --> 01:11:33.120
<v Speaker 2>adventure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They need an adventure,</v>

1193
01:11:33.180 --> 01:11:34.950
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They need an adventure,</v>

1194
01:11:35.580 --> 01:11:36.413
<v Speaker 2>and maybe their normative life is </v>
<v Speaker 2>sufficiently soft and undemanding so </v>

1195
01:11:40.201 --> 01:11:41.034
<v Speaker 2>that they could recede into a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>domestic unconsciousness as an </v>

1196
01:11:45.061 --> 01:11:45.894
<v Speaker 2>alternative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's nothing in that except a </v>

1197
01:11:48.301 --> 01:11:53.301
<v Speaker 2>prolonged prolonged non-existence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>self contempt and bitterness,</v>

1198
01:11:53.910 --> 01:11:54.900
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not good.</v>

1199
01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:57.450
<v Speaker 2>You need to be called to an adventure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so I would say,</v>

1200
01:11:57.451 --> 01:11:58.284
<v Speaker 2>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what etiologies offer young </v>

1201
01:12:02.191 --> 01:12:04.920
<v Speaker 2>people is the call to an adventure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a false adventure.</v>

1202
01:12:04.921 --> 01:12:05.940
<v Speaker 2>I would say instead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1203
01:12:05.941 --> 01:12:08.160
<v Speaker 2>you want an adventure is open up your </v>
<v Speaker 2>eyes,</v>

1204
01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:11.010
<v Speaker 2>open up your eyes to what the world is </v>
<v Speaker 2>really like,</v>

1205
01:12:11.340 --> 01:12:14.550
<v Speaker 2>and then take your place in it as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>productive,</v>

1206
01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:15.840
<v Speaker 2>awake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>attentive,</v>

1207
01:12:15.841 --> 01:12:19.770
<v Speaker 2>and truthful being and see how far you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can walk up hill.</v>

1208
01:12:20.220 --> 01:12:24.150
<v Speaker 2>That's an adventure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the alternative to the call to war,</v>

1209
01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:26.670
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the call to wars and adventure,</v>

1210
01:12:26.850 --> 01:12:31.850
<v Speaker 2>William James said a 130 140 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need a moral equivalent to war</v>

1211
01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:36.031
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1212
01:12:36.031 --> 01:12:36.864
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it touches on exactly what you're </v>

1213
01:12:38.011 --> 01:12:41.100
<v Speaker 2>saying is these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these kids who are lost,</v>

1214
01:12:41.101 --> 01:12:41.934
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe somewhat bitter and resentful </v>

1215
01:12:43.771 --> 01:12:47.550
<v Speaker 2>as a consequence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They see in Isis a call to adventure.</v>

1216
01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:50.300
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1217
01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:51.833
<v Speaker 2>I understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw this kid once in Montreal and an </v>

1218
01:12:55.501 --> 01:12:56.334
<v Speaker 2>outside shopping mall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was about six foot five and he was </v>

1219
01:12:58.471 --> 01:13:00.360
<v Speaker 2>dressed up like a punk rocker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1220
01:13:00.990 --> 01:13:05.430
<v Speaker 2>and he was standing on the corner with </v>
<v Speaker 2>two pink shopping bags in his hand and I</v>

1221
01:13:05.431 --> 01:13:06.264
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a ridiculous figure he cut because </v>

1222
01:13:08.790 --> 01:13:11.070
<v Speaker 2>he was all dressed up like a viking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1223
01:13:11.071 --> 01:13:13.800
<v Speaker 2>He was ready to go out there and have </v>
<v Speaker 2>his damn adventure.</v>

1224
01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:14.633
<v Speaker 2>And what he was doing instead was </v>
<v Speaker 2>standing in an outdoor shopping mall </v>

1225
01:13:17.191 --> 01:13:19.080
<v Speaker 2>with two pink shopping bags.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1226
01:13:19.470 --> 01:13:21.750
<v Speaker 2>come up to a kid like that and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1227
01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:25.080
<v Speaker 2>you want to go get into some trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some interesting trouble.</v>

1228
01:13:25.081 --> 01:13:28.770
<v Speaker 2>He's gonna like throw those shopping </v>
<v Speaker 2>bags away and come with you instantly.</v>

1229
01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:29.881
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1230
01:13:29.881 --> 01:13:31.760
<v Speaker 2>well you need some interesting trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1231
01:13:31.761 --> 01:13:33.090
<v Speaker 2>what could that be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1232
01:13:33.091 --> 01:13:35.340
<v Speaker 2>here's something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get your act together,</v>

1233
01:13:35.940 --> 01:13:38.460
<v Speaker 2>discipline yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at the world,</v>

1234
01:13:38.461 --> 01:13:41.250
<v Speaker 2>see if you can find a problem to solve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grow up.</v>

1235
01:13:42.010 --> 01:13:42.843
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when.</v>

1236
01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:43.733
<v Speaker 2>What's so interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that's been so </v>

1237
01:13:45.241 --> 01:13:46.074
<v Speaker 2>interesting to me to observe as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequence of what I've been talking </v>

1238
01:13:49.891 --> 01:13:54.891
<v Speaker 2>about is just how many people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>starving for that message.</v>

1239
01:13:56.230 --> 01:13:57.063
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have after my talks now say I was in </v>

1240
01:14:00.001 --> 01:14:00.834
<v Speaker 2>La and about 700 people lined up </v>
<v Speaker 2>afterwards to have a book signed and </v>

1241
01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:05.580
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>

1242
01:14:05.580 --> 01:14:06.413
<v Speaker 2>the vast majority of them have a story </v>
<v Speaker 2>to tell and so the little exchanges I </v>

1243
01:14:09.841 --> 01:14:11.880
<v Speaker 2>have with people are very intense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1244
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:15.280
<v Speaker 2>because they want to have a minute to </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell me what's happening and,</v>

1245
01:14:15.990 --> 01:14:18.070
<v Speaker 2>or 30 seconds even and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1246
01:14:18.110 --> 01:14:23.110
<v Speaker 2>here was 10 things going terribly wrong </v>
<v Speaker 2>with my life and I've been trying to aim</v>

1247
01:14:23.921 --> 01:14:25.810
<v Speaker 2>up and say what I have to say it.</v>

1248
01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:30.250
<v Speaker 2>Everything's much better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you very much and I thank God,</v>

1249
01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:31.473
<v Speaker 2>good work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the next person comes up and </v>

1250
01:14:32.831 --> 01:14:37.480
<v Speaker 2>says the same thing and I've got like </v>
<v Speaker 2>25,000 letters that have said that since</v>

1251
01:14:37.481 --> 01:14:39.250
<v Speaker 2>August.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1252
01:14:39.820 --> 01:14:40.653
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a way of calling people to an </v>

1253
01:14:41.921 --> 01:14:44.170
<v Speaker 2>adventure that perhaps isn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>destructive.</v>

1254
01:14:44.350 --> 01:14:47.650
<v Speaker 2>They have enough right in front of them </v>
<v Speaker 2>to have a great adventure if they're,</v>

1255
01:14:48.070 --> 01:14:49.300
<v Speaker 2>if they're willing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

1256
01:14:49.660 --> 01:14:53.350
<v Speaker 2>to try not to lie and to tell the truth </v>
<v Speaker 2>and to aim up hill.</v>

1257
01:14:53.980 --> 01:14:55.660
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that adventures right in front of </v>
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>

1258
01:14:55.661 --> 01:14:56.494
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's part of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's part of the process of </v>

1259
01:14:58.990 --> 01:15:03.880
<v Speaker 2>engendering paradise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to find the adventure in,</v>

1260
01:15:03.990 --> 01:15:06.920
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to find the proper divide.</v>

1261
01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:08.391
<v Speaker 2>Excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1262
01:15:08.391 --> 01:15:11.720
<v Speaker 2>to find the divine adventure in every </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual life.</v>

1263
01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:13.433
<v Speaker 2>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's that union of the divine and the </v>

1264
01:15:15.511 --> 01:15:17.550
<v Speaker 2>historical and Christianity too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1265
01:15:17.551 --> 01:15:19.270
<v Speaker 2>It's to make the archetype real.</v>

1266
01:15:23.850 --> 01:15:24.683
<v Speaker 1>Number six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>set your house in perfect order before </v>

1267
01:15:27.511 --> 01:15:32.511
<v Speaker 1>you criticize the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that also you begin,</v>

1268
01:15:32.970 --> 01:15:36.060
<v Speaker 1>you begin with yourself and you start to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

1269
01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:38.160
<v Speaker 1>be the change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

1270
01:15:38.790 --> 01:15:39.670
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1271
01:15:39.770 --> 01:15:41.760
<v Speaker 1>a way of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1272
01:15:42.620 --> 01:15:46.320
<v Speaker 1>being</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitter against the world,</v>

1273
01:15:46.830 --> 01:15:48.480
<v Speaker 1>at least not to begin with.</v>

1274
01:15:48.650 --> 01:15:50.390
<v Speaker 2>At least that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a start.</v>

1275
01:15:50.391 --> 01:15:52.340
<v Speaker 2>You can say to yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1276
01:15:53.030 --> 01:15:57.190
<v Speaker 2>everything looks pretty terrible to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the hell?</v>

1277
01:15:57.580 --> 01:15:58.413
<v Speaker 2>How can it be this way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then you can take the next step and </v>

1278
01:16:00.731 --> 01:16:01.564
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1279
01:16:01.690 --> 01:16:06.400
<v Speaker 2>maybe I not everything I could be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how about if I try to be everything I</v>

1280
01:16:06.401 --> 01:16:07.234
<v Speaker 2>could be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then think about it again later and </v>

1281
01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:11.713
<v Speaker 2>it's the right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's because the alternative to that </v>

1282
01:16:13.631 --> 01:16:15.190
<v Speaker 2>is just a catastrophe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1283
01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:19.880
<v Speaker 1>That's the key to dignity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1284
01:16:20.820 --> 01:16:23.390
<v Speaker 1>Can Be dignified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you're,</v>

1285
01:16:23.540 --> 01:16:25.890
<v Speaker 1>you're not the best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strongest,</v>

1286
01:16:26.270 --> 01:16:27.470
<v Speaker 1>most beautiful love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>

1287
01:16:28.390 --> 01:16:32.260
<v Speaker 1>if you set yourself in order and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>take yourself seriously,</v>

1288
01:16:32.350 --> 01:16:33.183
<v Speaker 1>then you can have dignity and other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people will notice it and you will </v>

1289
01:16:35.861 --> 01:16:36.694
<v Speaker 1>notice it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a great place to start from and </v>

1290
01:16:40.330 --> 01:16:42.950
<v Speaker 1>to strive for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's one of the most.</v>

1291
01:16:43.750 --> 01:16:45.640
<v Speaker 1>One of the best things about your book </v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

1292
01:16:45.641 --> 01:16:49.330
<v Speaker 1>that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you bring dignity into,</v>

1293
01:16:50.180 --> 01:16:53.240
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring to people's lives with this book.</v>

1294
01:16:53.241 --> 01:16:54.074
<v Speaker 1>Go with your lecturers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the takeaways I have from </v>

1295
01:16:57.890 --> 01:16:58.723
<v Speaker 1>speaking with people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because after the last interview I did </v>

1296
01:17:02.490 --> 01:17:05.420
<v Speaker 1>and then people read the piece I wrote </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then people,</v>

1297
01:17:05.700 --> 01:17:09.030
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people thank me for introducing</v>
<v Speaker 1>you to</v>

1298
01:17:13.070 --> 01:17:15.790
<v Speaker 1>and then that's been one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>recurring themes.</v>

1299
01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:22.270
<v Speaker 1>I feel so much a strongly themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so some of them at least.</v>

1300
01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:25.770
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a great observation.</v>

1301
01:17:25.771 --> 01:17:26.604
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know our society's week because we </v>

1302
01:17:28.861 --> 01:17:32.520
<v Speaker 2>think about happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't we think about dignity?</v>

1303
01:17:32.820 --> 01:17:33.653
<v Speaker 2>Why don't we think about mobility?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't we think about truth and </v>

1304
01:17:35.941 --> 01:17:38.850
<v Speaker 2>responsibility or beauty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of those things there.</v>

1305
01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:39.953
<v Speaker 2>They're much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're the values that sustain you </v>

1306
01:17:42.241 --> 01:17:45.390
<v Speaker 2>through suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Happiness cannot do that.</v>

1307
01:17:46.620 --> 01:17:50.380
<v Speaker 2>Not that happiness is is to be to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

1308
01:17:50.930 --> 01:17:51.763
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no utility in contempt for </v>

1309
01:17:53.791 --> 01:17:56.070
<v Speaker 2>happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank God if it comes,</v>

1310
01:17:56.730 --> 01:17:57.563
<v Speaker 2>but dignity mean we can't even.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When is the last time you heard someone </v>

1311
01:18:01.441 --> 01:18:02.274
<v Speaker 2>talk about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even part of the public discourse and </v>

1312
01:18:07.141 --> 01:18:08.220
<v Speaker 2>it's so crucial.</v>

1313
01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:17.760
<v Speaker 1>It's not something you strive for it too</v>
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

1314
01:18:17.761 --> 01:18:19.080
<v Speaker 1>You won't get it.</v>

1315
01:18:19.530 --> 01:18:22.290
<v Speaker 2>Do you mean dignity or happiness?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Happiness.</v>

1316
01:18:24.290 --> 01:18:25.051
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1317
01:18:25.051 --> 01:18:28.290
<v Speaker 2>you might say if you strive for dignity </v>
<v Speaker 2>and truth,</v>

1318
01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:30.690
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you'll be rewarded with </v>
<v Speaker 2>happiness.</v>

1319
01:18:31.810 --> 01:18:32.643
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a grace of God that that </v>

1320
01:18:34.321 --> 01:18:35.154
<v Speaker 2>happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not something you can conjure up </v>

1321
01:18:36.871 --> 01:18:39.330
<v Speaker 2>on your own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good luck trying.</v>

1322
01:18:41.650 --> 01:18:42.483
<v Speaker 1>So I think I've taken up almost two </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours of your time and we write the </v>

1323
01:18:47.681 --> 01:18:48.514
<v Speaker 1>piece,</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes the interview with the book and </v>

1324
01:18:55.370 --> 01:18:56.203
<v Speaker 1>also just I was writing this piece and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was 18,000 characters and I was just </v>

1325
01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:06.220
<v Speaker 1>so stressed out and I was telling my </v>
<v Speaker 1>wife,</v>

1326
01:19:06.750 --> 01:19:08.400
<v Speaker 1>it's like fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It hydrates,</v>

1327
01:19:09.430 --> 01:19:12.490
<v Speaker 1>new heads coming up all the time and she</v>
<v Speaker 1>was just laughing at me like,</v>

1328
01:19:12.550 --> 01:19:14.170

<v Speaker 2>regards to architectural stories is that</v>

1331
01:19:22.931 --> 01:19:24.850
<v Speaker 2>once you hear them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no getting rid of them.</v>
