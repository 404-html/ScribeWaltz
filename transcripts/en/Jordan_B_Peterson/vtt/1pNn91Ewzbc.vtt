1
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.400
<v Speaker 1>Hi everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here we are for the first q and a for</v>

2
00:00:32.401 --> 00:00:35.180
<v Speaker 1>2018.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.480
<v Speaker 1>there's 514 questions lined up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I'm going to get to all of</v>

4
00:00:39.481 --> 00:00:40.314
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's been a busy time since the last </v>

5
00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:43.890
<v Speaker 1>time I did a q and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A.</v>

6
00:00:43.891 --> 00:00:46.470
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of you probably know about the,</v>

7
00:00:46.471 --> 00:00:47.304
<v Speaker 1>when Lindsay Shepherd a at Wilfrid </v>
<v Speaker 1>laurier university where a teaching </v>

8
00:00:50.731 --> 00:00:54.120
<v Speaker 1>assistant was brought in front of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tribunal,</v>

9
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:55.303
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because she had the temerity to play a </v>

10
00:00:56.311 --> 00:01:01.311
<v Speaker 1>video where I was discussing bill see 16</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a public television show.</v>

11
00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.313
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's been quite the national and </v>

12
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.073
<v Speaker 1>interval national scandal I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I made a bit of a video about </v>

13
00:01:08.431 --> 00:01:10.050
<v Speaker 1>that today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I haven't launched yet.</v>

14
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:11.323
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>contains a message to junior high and </v>

15
00:01:13.621 --> 00:01:16.920
<v Speaker 1>high school students.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm recommending to them that they,</v>

16
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.900
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess you'll have to watch the video.</v>

17
00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.223
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't mean to make it a cliffhanger </v>

18
00:01:22.021 --> 00:01:22.854
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then as soon as I said that I </v>

19
00:01:23.731 --> 00:01:25.980
<v Speaker 1>thought better of it and thought maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just wait.</v>

20
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.430
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look here.</v>

21
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:30.383
<v Speaker 1>Steve a has the first question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can we know the difference between </v>

22
00:01:33.061 --> 00:01:36.810
<v Speaker 1>unhealthy repression and healthy self </v>
<v Speaker 1>restraint of sexuality?</v>

23
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:38.910
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

24
00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of what constitutes ethics,</v>

25
00:01:45.591 --> 00:01:47.420
<v Speaker 1>let's say first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's start,</v>

26
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:48.343
<v Speaker 1>let's think about ethics to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's the point of conducting your </v>

27
00:01:53.031 --> 00:01:53.864
<v Speaker 1>life ethically?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The answer to that isn't so that you </v>

28
00:01:56.031 --> 00:01:56.864
<v Speaker 1>follow the proper rules precisely the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer to that is so that you </v>

29
00:02:01.761 --> 00:02:02.594
<v Speaker 1>balance your life so that it says </v>
<v Speaker 1>productive and meaningful as it can </v>

30
00:02:05.751 --> 00:02:06.584
<v Speaker 1>possibly be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that would be productive and </v>

31
00:02:08.001 --> 00:02:08.834
<v Speaker 1>meaningful for you with any luck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also for people around you that </v>

32
00:02:12.951 --> 00:02:13.930
<v Speaker 1>would even be better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

33
00:02:13.931 --> 00:02:17.840
<v Speaker 1>and for you now and next week and into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the future.</v>

34
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:19.183
<v Speaker 1>So it's sort of a variation of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosopher Emmanuel counts moral </v>

35
00:02:23.031 --> 00:02:23.864
<v Speaker 1>dictum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was act such that your action </v>

36
00:02:26.151 --> 00:02:28.400
<v Speaker 1>becomes a moral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a universal,</v>

37
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.080
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although I think that it's,</v>

38
00:02:30.081 --> 00:02:33.860
<v Speaker 1>it's better phrased across time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>across people like that.</v>

39
00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:35.683
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when you're thinking about an ethic </v>

40
00:02:38.541 --> 00:02:41.330
<v Speaker 1>that has to do with any fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation like sexuality,</v>

41
00:02:41.331 --> 00:02:45.110
<v Speaker 1>you have to think about it in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>context of the rest of your life.</v>

42
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.280
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

43
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.430
<v Speaker 1>the question is whether or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

44
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:50.840
<v Speaker 1>what did I say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

45
00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.140
<v Speaker 1>what did I read at one point that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>really liked with regards to sexuality?</v>

46
00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:55.653
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

47
00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.860
<v Speaker 1>Who's in control?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>

48
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:00.663
<v Speaker 1>is it you or is it the sexuality that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>in control is have you integrated your </v>

49
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:06.693
<v Speaker 1>sexual life into the rest of your life </v>
<v Speaker 1>so that the whole thing makes a </v>

50
00:03:10.061 --> 00:03:10.894
<v Speaker 1>harmonious balance?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Are you in charge or is it in </v>

51
00:03:13.871 --> 00:03:14.800
<v Speaker 1>charge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak?</v>

52
00:03:14.801 --> 00:03:18.640
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're not in charge with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that harmonious balance,</v>

53
00:03:18.641 --> 00:03:19.474
<v Speaker 1>then things are going to waver wildly </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of control and you're going to find </v>

54
00:03:22.451 --> 00:03:23.284
<v Speaker 1>yourself in dreadful trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That happens whenever any given driver </v>

55
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.230
<v Speaker 1>me really any given value predominates </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the exclusion of all else.</v>

56
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.393
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that sexuality is best </v>

57
00:03:36.971 --> 00:03:39.580
<v Speaker 1>handled within the confines of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>

58
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:41.283
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the classic ethical solution to </v>

59
00:03:43.871 --> 00:03:44.704
<v Speaker 1>the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because sexuality brings with it a </v>

60
00:03:48.101 --> 00:03:49.900
<v Speaker 1>tremendous amount of responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

61
00:03:49.901 --> 00:03:50.734
<v Speaker 1>people don't like to think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially people who I would say are </v>

62
00:03:52.931 --> 00:03:55.900
<v Speaker 1>low in conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say are high in impulsivity.</v>

63
00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:00.790
<v Speaker 1>It's easy for people to believe in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>

64
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:01.803
<v Speaker 1>Casual sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not something that I think </v>

65
00:04:03.131 --> 00:04:03.964
<v Speaker 1>exists because I don't think you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>divorce sex from its sociological or </v>

66
00:04:07.871 --> 00:04:10.900
<v Speaker 1>political or economic or psychological </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>

67
00:04:10.901 --> 00:04:11.734
<v Speaker 1>And I would say the endless scandals </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have plagued the United States in </v>

68
00:04:16.631 --> 00:04:17.464
<v Speaker 1>particular in the last year with regards</v>
<v Speaker 1>to sexual behavior are proof positive </v>

69
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.330
<v Speaker 1>that there's no such thing as casual </v>
<v Speaker 1>sex.</v>

70
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.100
<v Speaker 1>I think the reason for that is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences of sex are too dramatic.</v>

71
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.760
<v Speaker 1>It's not just pregnancy and disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

72
00:04:33.761 --> 00:04:35.280
<v Speaker 1>which are both,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

73
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.150
<v Speaker 1>as dramatic as consequences can be in </v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

74
00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:45.370
<v Speaker 1>but also the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no disentangling sexual behavior</v>

75
00:04:45.371 --> 00:04:48.100
<v Speaker 1>from emotional behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe you could say even worse if you</v>

76
00:04:48.101 --> 00:04:51.220
<v Speaker 1>try to disentangle your sexual behavior </v>
<v Speaker 1>from your emotional behavior,</v>

77
00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.910
<v Speaker 1>then I think what happens is that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>end up cold and cynical.</v>

78
00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:56.351
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

79
00:04:56.351 --> 00:04:59.320
<v Speaker 1>let's say if you're a a cereal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're us,</v>

80
00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:00.363
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have a lot of one night stands </v>

81
00:05:02.171 --> 00:05:03.004
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of casual partners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then first of all there's not much </v>

82
00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.710
<v Speaker 1>discrimination between one partner and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other.</v>

83
00:05:08.711 --> 00:05:12.880
<v Speaker 1>And so in some sense you're in a loop </v>
<v Speaker 1>and just repeating the same act over and</v>

84
00:05:12.881 --> 00:05:14.350
<v Speaker 1>over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't,</v>

85
00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:17.580
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing deep about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing that,</v>

86
00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.590
<v Speaker 1>that enables you to establish a </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with another person.</v>

87
00:05:20.591 --> 00:05:21.424
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that you corrupt your soul in </v>

88
00:05:24.101 --> 00:05:24.934
<v Speaker 1>that way and that you hurt yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>across time and of course you're going </v>

89
00:05:28.031 --> 00:05:28.864
<v Speaker 1>to hurt other people as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not a big admirer of the casual </v>

90
00:05:31.151 --> 00:05:31.984
<v Speaker 1>sex idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a demented adolescents </v>

91
00:05:34.631 --> 00:05:36.110
<v Speaker 1>fantasy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

92
00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:39.160
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally it just doesn't work out </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the real world.</v>

93
00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.100
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy self restraint.</v>

94
00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:43.780
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with regards to sexuality,</v>

95
00:05:43.781 --> 00:05:46.270
<v Speaker 1>it's the same with everything else is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's,</v>

96
00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:47.253
<v Speaker 1>there's the necessity to forego </v>
<v Speaker 1>immediate gratification for the purpose </v>

97
00:05:51.011 --> 00:05:53.890
<v Speaker 1>of medium to longterm thriving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

98
00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:55.263
<v Speaker 1>So if your sexuality is integrated in an</v>
<v Speaker 1>ethic that encompasses the rest of your </v>

99
00:05:59.721 --> 00:06:01.640
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if it serves that ethic,</v>

100
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.210
<v Speaker 1>then I would say it's properly </v>
<v Speaker 1>restrained.</v>

101
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:06.553
<v Speaker 1>If it's unhealthily repressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then you're angry and bitter and </v>

102
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:14.090
<v Speaker 1>resentful and cursing the opposite sex </v>
<v Speaker 1>or perhaps the same sex.</v>

103
00:06:14.091 --> 00:06:14.924
<v Speaker 1>If you happen to be gay for failing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognize your particular form of </v>

104
00:06:18.651 --> 00:06:19.830
<v Speaker 1>sexual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

105
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:20.803
<v Speaker 1>what would you call attractiveness?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think resentment and anger are good </v>

106
00:06:23.691 --> 00:06:24.524
<v Speaker 1>indication that there's something wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the manner in which your sexuality </v>

107
00:06:27.381 --> 00:06:28.214
<v Speaker 1>is restraint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I hope hopefully that's a decent </v>

108
00:06:31.071 --> 00:06:34.610
<v Speaker 1>answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trev moocs as why are dragons in western</v>

109
00:06:34.611 --> 00:06:35.444
<v Speaker 1>culture bringers of death and </v>
<v Speaker 1>destruction that must be slain while in </v>

110
00:06:38.181 --> 00:06:38.630
<v Speaker 1>the east.</v>

111
00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:41.060
<v Speaker 1>They're portant of good fortune to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>revered.</v>

112
00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.260
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

113
00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.550
<v Speaker 1>that's a great question by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

114
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:46.070
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Dragon,</v>

115
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:49.783
<v Speaker 1>the Dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I already defined the dragon at some </v>

116
00:06:51.561 --> 00:06:52.394
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly from a book I read a while back </v>

117
00:06:53.451 --> 00:06:56.720
<v Speaker 1>on dragons as a tree cat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>snake bird.</v>

118
00:06:56.721 --> 00:07:01.010
<v Speaker 1>The idea in the book was that the Dragon</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a images stick representation of the</v>

119
00:07:01.011 --> 00:07:01.844
<v Speaker 1>class of all predators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means also might be why dragons </v>

120
00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:07.303
<v Speaker 1>also breathe fire because fire was </v>
<v Speaker 1>undoubtedly a common destructive agent </v>

121
00:07:11.271 --> 00:07:12.104
<v Speaker 1>in our evolutionary past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the dragon is the most primordial </v>

122
00:07:16.251 --> 00:07:20.240
<v Speaker 1>sim symbol of that which lurks beyond,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is known.</v>

123
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:22.183
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's even more primordial that that </v>

124
00:07:23.601 --> 00:07:27.590
<v Speaker 1>because it even is that which lurks </v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond what is unknown in some sense.</v>

125
00:07:27.591 --> 00:07:29.370
<v Speaker 1>Remember Don Rumsfeld,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unknown,</v>

126
00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.220
<v Speaker 1>unknown unknowns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

127
00:07:31.221 --> 00:07:34.910
<v Speaker 1>that's basically the drag it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are some unknowns that pop up that</v>

128
00:07:34.911 --> 00:07:35.744
<v Speaker 1>you can master right away and you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of think of those as known </v>

129
00:07:37.761 --> 00:07:38.594
<v Speaker 1>unknowns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but unknown unknown's are those things </v>

130
00:07:40.341 --> 00:07:41.750
<v Speaker 1>that pop up that you don't know about.</v>

131
00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:42.793
<v Speaker 1>You didn't even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had no idea whatsoever that they </v>

132
00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:49.430
<v Speaker 1>even existed anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the character of an unknown?</v>

133
00:07:49.431 --> 00:07:50.450
<v Speaker 1>Unknown?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

134
00:07:50.451 --> 00:07:53.150
<v Speaker 1>part of it's terrifying because it can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can.</v>

135
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:54.740
<v Speaker 1>It can do you in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

136
00:07:55.160 --> 00:08:00.050
<v Speaker 1>but part of it's also positive and </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it,</v>

137
00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:01.213
<v Speaker 1>anything that's truly unknown brings it </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a tremendous amount of new </v>

138
00:08:03.981 --> 00:08:04.814
<v Speaker 1>possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why dragons hoard gold or why </v>

139
00:08:07.191 --> 00:08:10.330
<v Speaker 1>they also heard princesses or guard </v>
<v Speaker 1>princesses hoard,</v>

140
00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:11.173
<v Speaker 1>I would say is the right word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think the dragon in the West </v>

141
00:08:14.751 --> 00:08:15.584
<v Speaker 1>is a fully negative symbol because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dragon has gold associated with it or </v>

142
00:08:18.621 --> 00:08:21.230
<v Speaker 1>virgin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason for that is that the hero who</v>

143
00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:24.470
<v Speaker 1>confronts the Dragon gets the Virgin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that hasn't changed.</v>

144
00:08:24.471 --> 00:08:26.800
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a story as old as time.</v>

145
00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:29.960
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think it'll ever change as </v>
<v Speaker 1>long as there are human beings.</v>

146
00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:35.410
<v Speaker 1>Now why the Chinese put stress on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive side and the West put stress on</v>

147
00:08:38.241 --> 00:08:40.250
<v Speaker 1>the negative side is difficult to say.</v>

148
00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:45.140
<v Speaker 1>I might say because the Chinese got </v>
<v Speaker 1>organized so early,</v>

149
00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:46.453
<v Speaker 1>I have a sneaking suspicion that it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>easier for them to see a little bit of </v>

150
00:08:50.331 --> 00:08:51.164
<v Speaker 1>chaos is something positive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something necessary and positive as a </v>

151
00:08:54.111 --> 00:08:58.830
<v Speaker 1>counterbalance to tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 1>organizational weight of their state.</v>

152
00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:01.260
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the best,</v>

153
00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.810
<v Speaker 1>best answer that I've been able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>formulate.</v>

154
00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.450
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

155
00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:08.753
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dragon is a very complex and </v>

156
00:09:09.871 --> 00:09:10.860
<v Speaker 1>ambivalence symbol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

157
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:14.280
<v Speaker 1>it combines everything into one symbol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive and negative.</v>

158
00:09:14.281 --> 00:09:16.800
<v Speaker 1>And then you can stress the positive or </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can stress the negative.</v>

159
00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:20.940
<v Speaker 1>You could also say to some degree that </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether a dragon is positive or negative</v>

160
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:25.740
<v Speaker 1>depends to some degree on the manner in </v>
<v Speaker 1>which you approach it.</v>

161
00:09:25.741 --> 00:09:30.741
<v Speaker 1>Because the psychological reality is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that dragons approached voluntarily,</v>

162
00:09:31.681 --> 00:09:34.770
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>small are most likely to be positive and</v>

163
00:09:34.771 --> 00:09:36.600
<v Speaker 1>that's a really good thing to know in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your life.</v>

164
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:37.800
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a good reason.</v>

165
00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:39.323
<v Speaker 1>It's a good rule of thumb to help you </v>
<v Speaker 1>stop avoiding things that you shouldn't </v>

166
00:09:42.541 --> 00:09:43.374
<v Speaker 1>avoid so that they don't grow and </v>
<v Speaker 1>magnified beyond your capacity to deal </v>

167
00:09:46.771 --> 00:09:47.604
<v Speaker 1>with them.</v>

168
00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:52.280
<v Speaker 1>You often mentioned disciplining </v>
<v Speaker 1>children so they behave.</v>

169
00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:53.683
<v Speaker 1>What is your advice for making them </v>
<v Speaker 1>behave without resorting to corporal </v>

170
00:09:56.451 --> 00:09:57.800
<v Speaker 1>punishment?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

171
00:09:57.801 --> 00:09:58.634
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends on what you mean by corporal </v>

172
00:09:59.751 --> 00:10:01.160
<v Speaker 1>punishment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

173
00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.740
<v Speaker 1>timeout could be regarded as corporal </v>
<v Speaker 1>punishment.</v>

174
00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:06.530
<v Speaker 1>It also depends very much on the age of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the child.</v>

175
00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:08.930
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at say a two year old,</v>

176
00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:11.300
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my new book,</v>

177
00:10:11.301 --> 00:10:12.134
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a chapter in there called don't </v>

178
00:10:15.801 --> 00:10:18.470
<v Speaker 1>let your children do anything that makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>you dislike them.</v>

179
00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:20.053
<v Speaker 1>And the reason that I wrote a chapter </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that is because people who let </v>

180
00:10:23.901 --> 00:10:27.110
<v Speaker 1>their children do things that make them </v>
<v Speaker 1>dislike them,</v>

181
00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:28.153
<v Speaker 1>end up disliking them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because there's a huge power </v>

182
00:10:29.721 --> 00:10:30.554
<v Speaker 1>differential,</v>
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking between adults and </v>

183
00:10:32.001 --> 00:10:32.834
<v Speaker 1>children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you end up disliking your children </v>

184
00:10:34.041 --> 00:10:37.820
<v Speaker 1>because they're not behaving well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're behaving disgracefully say,</v>

185
00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:39.013
<v Speaker 1>or they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or they're challenging your position in </v>

186
00:10:41.661 --> 00:10:45.800
<v Speaker 1>the authority hierarchy to regularly </v>
<v Speaker 1>something you won't put up with.</v>

187
00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.390
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you think you will,</v>

188
00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:50.780
<v Speaker 1>it's necessary to get your disciplinary </v>
<v Speaker 1>routine straight.</v>

189
00:10:50.781 --> 00:10:55.130
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing I would say is figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>out what the rules are.</v>

190
00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:57.630
<v Speaker 1>There shouldn't be too many.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

191
00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:58.573
<v Speaker 1>for two year olds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically they have to know what no </v>

192
00:11:01.191 --> 00:11:02.024
<v Speaker 1>means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they also have to learn as they </v>

193
00:11:05.151 --> 00:11:10.151
<v Speaker 1>approached three not to kick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hit bite or steel essentially.</v>

194
00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:14.690
<v Speaker 1>Now it's easy to train a two year old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no means you can actually start with</v>

195
00:11:14.691 --> 00:11:18.020
<v Speaker 1>a child that's only 13 months old at </v>
<v Speaker 1>child that can cry,</v>

196
00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:19.213
<v Speaker 1>let's say that or that can crawl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say that you have a child is </v>

197
00:11:22.431 --> 00:11:24.350
<v Speaker 1>starting to crawl and wants to explore </v>
<v Speaker 1>the house.</v>

198
00:11:24.351 --> 00:11:25.184
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have any sense is try to get rid </v>

199
00:11:27.801 --> 00:11:28.634
<v Speaker 1>of most things that the child could </v>
<v Speaker 1>cause a tremendous amount of trouble </v>

200
00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:32.900
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

201
00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:33.793
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the things or to the child so that </v>

202
00:11:35.901 --> 00:11:37.190
<v Speaker 1>it's reasonably safe.</v>

203
00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:38.533
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the child is going to want to </v>

204
00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.620
<v Speaker 1>want to crawl around and get into </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

205
00:11:42.621 --> 00:11:43.454
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe there are things you don't </v>

206
00:11:44.601 --> 00:11:47.920
<v Speaker 1>want him or her to get into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe there's a uh,</v>

207
00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:50.450
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would we say?</v>

208
00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:51.313
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's a tablecloth and on top of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tablecloth there's a plant or maybe </v>

209
00:11:54.521 --> 00:11:55.354
<v Speaker 1>there's some plants on the floor and </v>
<v Speaker 1>when the child is crawling and goes off </v>

210
00:11:59.681 --> 00:12:01.780
<v Speaker 1>to do something that he or she </v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't,</v>

211
00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:05.290
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can just grab his leg and you know,</v>

212
00:12:05.291 --> 00:12:06.124
<v Speaker 1>gently but firmly and say no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the child will keep trying to move </v>

213
00:12:11.111 --> 00:12:11.944
<v Speaker 1>forward because they're stubborn little </v>
<v Speaker 1>blighters and you can continue to say </v>

214
00:12:14.531 --> 00:12:18.610
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you persist with saying no,</v>

215
00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:22.570
<v Speaker 1>then the child will eventually give up </v>
<v Speaker 1>and sort of go limp.</v>

216
00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:24.003
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now and often the child will cry when </v>

217
00:12:26.321 --> 00:12:27.154
<v Speaker 1>you do that.</v>

218
00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:29.170
<v Speaker 1>And of course that might make you feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>guilty,</v>

219
00:12:29.171 --> 00:12:30.004
<v Speaker 1>but what that means is that you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>effectively brought to behavior to a </v>

220
00:12:32.951 --> 00:12:35.890
<v Speaker 1>halt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you do that 10 times,</v>

221
00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:36.933
<v Speaker 1>you've got to watch your child and don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop them from exploring things that </v>

222
00:12:40.661 --> 00:12:41.494
<v Speaker 1>they need to explore it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to use this sort of thing with </v>

223
00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:47.560
<v Speaker 1>judiciously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can grab them by the leg and say,</v>

224
00:12:47.561 --> 00:12:48.910
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

225
00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.880
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And wait until they give up.</v>

226
00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:53.980
<v Speaker 1>Usually they'll cry and then you can let</v>
<v Speaker 1>them go.</v>

227
00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:56.890
<v Speaker 1>And then soon after you do that about 10</v>
<v Speaker 1>times soon.</v>

228
00:12:56.891 --> 00:12:59.650
<v Speaker 1>Then if you just say no with the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>tone of voice,</v>

229
00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:02.050
<v Speaker 1>the child will generally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens,</v>

230
00:13:02.051 --> 00:13:04.630
<v Speaker 1>the child will immediately cry and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>stop.</v>

231
00:13:04.631 --> 00:13:08.320
<v Speaker 1>And then after about 10 repeats of no </v>
<v Speaker 1>without having the lake grabbed,</v>

232
00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:09.393
<v Speaker 1>then no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll just produce stopping of the </v>

233
00:13:11.591 --> 00:13:12.424
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's unbelievably useful because </v>

234
00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:15.273
<v Speaker 1>as soon as your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you train your child to understand what </v>

235
00:13:18.041 --> 00:13:18.874
<v Speaker 1>no means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they really have free reign of the </v>

236
00:13:22.421 --> 00:13:25.750
<v Speaker 1>house in some sense with relative </v>
<v Speaker 1>minimal supervision from you.</v>

237
00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:26.703
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can learn what things they're not </v>

238
00:13:27.641 --> 00:13:28.474
<v Speaker 1>supposed to get into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's amazing how fast children can </v>

239
00:13:30.041 --> 00:13:30.874
<v Speaker 1>learn that and how fast they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>generalize to the class of things that </v>

240
00:13:34.061 --> 00:13:34.894
<v Speaker 1>they shouldn't get into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't have to teach them every </v>

241
00:13:36.311 --> 00:13:38.620
<v Speaker 1>single thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can generalize very rapidly.</v>

242
00:13:38.621 --> 00:13:39.454
<v Speaker 1>That's not much different than thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also once they are capable of </v>

243
00:13:43.751 --> 00:13:44.584
<v Speaker 1>understanding what no means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have an extremely potent means of </v>

244
00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:51.190
<v Speaker 1>helping them regulate their behavior </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a minimum of intervention.</v>

245
00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:56.170
<v Speaker 1>So that's unbelievably useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now let's say you have a two year old</v>

246
00:13:56.171 --> 00:13:59.080
<v Speaker 1>who's pretty contentious and two year </v>
<v Speaker 1>olds are pretty contentious.</v>

247
00:13:59.081 --> 00:14:02.140
<v Speaker 1>Some of them in particular because both </v>
<v Speaker 1>5% of two year olds,</v>

248
00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:05.170
<v Speaker 1>most of them are male,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are quite aggressive by temperament.</v>

249
00:14:05.171 --> 00:14:08.500
<v Speaker 1>And those are the ones that if you put </v>
<v Speaker 1>with other two year olds will frequently</v>

250
00:14:08.501 --> 00:14:10.840
<v Speaker 1>kick hit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bite or steel.</v>

251
00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:12.760
<v Speaker 1>Not all kids are like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some are.</v>

252
00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:16.180
<v Speaker 1>Most of them gets socialized out of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the time they about four.</v>

253
00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:17.223
<v Speaker 1>Now let's say you have an at two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they also start to experiment with </v>

254
00:14:20.291 --> 00:14:21.350
<v Speaker 1>saying no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

255
00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:23.380
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also with misbehaving,</v>

256
00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:25.150
<v Speaker 1>although they can do that even younger </v>
<v Speaker 1>than that.</v>

257
00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:26.463
<v Speaker 1>So if you have a two year old who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly rambunctious and who </v>

258
00:14:28.811 --> 00:14:29.644
<v Speaker 1>decides he isn't going to listen to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we use he in this example because it's </v>

259
00:14:33.191 --> 00:14:36.580
<v Speaker 1>boys that are more likely to misbehave </v>
<v Speaker 1>and not or not listen.</v>

260
00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:40.060
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can pick them up and you know by the</v>

261
00:14:40.061 --> 00:14:40.894
<v Speaker 1>arms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you got to get your attitude right </v>

262
00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:43.533
<v Speaker 1>because you don't want to be stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to let your kid make you </v>

263
00:14:45.611 --> 00:14:46.444
<v Speaker 1>mad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when they're really little </v>

264
00:14:47.111 --> 00:14:50.260
<v Speaker 1>because you're really big and you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>hurt them and so you gotta,</v>

265
00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:51.740
<v Speaker 1>you gotta have a clue.</v>

266
00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:54.200
<v Speaker 1>That's why you want to get the rules of </v>
<v Speaker 1>discipline in order.</v>

267
00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:57.230
<v Speaker 1>The minimum rules of discipline and why </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to have a strategy,</v>

268
00:14:57.231 --> 00:14:58.064
<v Speaker 1>but let's say your two or two year old </v>
<v Speaker 1>is insisting upon doing something that </v>

269
00:15:01.431 --> 00:15:05.420
<v Speaker 1>you don't want him to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like inserting a fork into an electrical</v>

270
00:15:05.421 --> 00:15:09.230
<v Speaker 1>outlet and you just can't have that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can say no.</v>

271
00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:13.270
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully you've already done the no </v>
<v Speaker 1>training that I recommended.</v>

272
00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:14.133
<v Speaker 1>And then if that doesn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I recommend doing is picking the </v>

273
00:15:16.701 --> 00:15:19.310
<v Speaker 1>child up by the arms and then putting </v>
<v Speaker 1>them on the steps.</v>

274
00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:20.121
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

275
00:15:20.121 --> 00:15:23.150
<v Speaker 1>you sit there until you're ready to </v>
<v Speaker 1>listen.</v>

276
00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:24.750
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

277
00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:25.853
<v Speaker 1>are usually the child will sit there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the rule has to be something like </v>

278
00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:33.050
<v Speaker 1>you can get up as soon as you ready to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be a civilized human being again and you</v>

279
00:15:33.051 --> 00:15:33.884
<v Speaker 1>can refer to yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your own attitude during a process like </v>

280
00:15:37.101 --> 00:15:37.310
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

281
00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:38.143
<v Speaker 1>Because if the child does comply and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sits on the steps and then comes and </v>

282
00:15:40.701 --> 00:15:41.870
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm ready to be good,</v>

283
00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:44.660
<v Speaker 1>and you like them again and you to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>honest about this,</v>

284
00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:45.673
<v Speaker 1>then you can tell that he's honest in </v>
<v Speaker 1>his decision to rejoin the civilized </v>

285
00:15:49.761 --> 00:15:50.594
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now sometimes if you put a two year old </v>

286
00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:54.920
<v Speaker 1>that's particularly rambunctious on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>staircase,</v>

287
00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:56.630
<v Speaker 1>that as soon as you let go of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>arms,</v>

288
00:15:56.631 --> 00:16:00.440
<v Speaker 1>they'll run off and that can be a game </v>
<v Speaker 1>or it can just be an act of defiance.</v>

289
00:16:00.441 --> 00:16:03.290
<v Speaker 1>And in that case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you go get them and he put him back</v>

290
00:16:03.291 --> 00:16:06.470
<v Speaker 1>on the steps and you do that several </v>
<v Speaker 1>times if necessary.</v>

291
00:16:06.471 --> 00:16:07.910
<v Speaker 1>And if that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that becomes a game,</v>

292
00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:11.060
<v Speaker 1>then you sit on the step and you hold </v>
<v Speaker 1>him by the arms.</v>

293
00:16:11.061 --> 00:16:13.670
<v Speaker 1>Remember no anger cause he's just too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for God's sake,</v>

294
00:16:13.671 --> 00:16:14.504
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to be angry is put them </v>

295
00:16:15.651 --> 00:16:17.360
<v Speaker 1>on the steps and hold them and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

296
00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:21.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm not letting you go until you sit </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and behave.</v>

297
00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:24.830
<v Speaker 1>And so if you hold them for a while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll squirm and look away and so forth.</v>

298
00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:27.320
<v Speaker 1>But you can get it as a tension if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a little bit stubborn,</v>

299
00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:30.680
<v Speaker 1>you hold him there and say you're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to sit there until I decide that you can</v>

300
00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:31.753
<v Speaker 1>leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you hold them and he'll squirm </v>

301
00:16:33.651 --> 00:16:34.484
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can outwait them if your </v>

302
00:16:35.271 --> 00:16:36.950
<v Speaker 1>patient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you gotta make the time.</v>

303
00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:39.650
<v Speaker 1>And then eventually he'll stop squirming</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can let him go.</v>

304
00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:41.720
<v Speaker 1>And then you can sit there and watch </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

305
00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:43.650
<v Speaker 1>And when you think he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

306
00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:46.610
<v Speaker 1>decided that he's going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilized creature,</v>

307
00:16:46.611 --> 00:16:47.444
<v Speaker 1>then you can say that's good and you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>give them a pat on the head and you can </v>

308
00:16:49.761 --> 00:16:51.470
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go back and do what we're doing.</v>

309
00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:54.770
<v Speaker 1>And the rule has to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see that the punishment not only has</v>

310
00:16:54.771 --> 00:16:59.660
<v Speaker 1>to bring the behavior to haul in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most merciful manner possible,</v>

311
00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:01.220
<v Speaker 1>but it's still effective.</v>

312
00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:02.293
<v Speaker 1>But it also has to satisfy your need for</v>
<v Speaker 1>order and justice so that you don't </v>

313
00:17:06.201 --> 00:17:07.034
<v Speaker 1>carry resentment and irritation about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the child's misbehavior forward with </v>

314
00:17:11.481 --> 00:17:12.314
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you don't want to kid yourself </v>

315
00:17:13.311 --> 00:17:14.144
<v Speaker 1>about what sort of Nice person you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not nearly as nice a person as </v>

316
00:17:16.701 --> 00:17:18.650
<v Speaker 1>you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And no one likes to be,</v>

317
00:17:19.070 --> 00:17:19.903
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brought down the authority hierarchy by </v>

318
00:17:22.671 --> 00:17:27.230
<v Speaker 1>a recalcitrant two year old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in almost all circumstances,</v>

319
00:17:27.231 --> 00:17:30.620
<v Speaker 1>those processes will suffice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

320
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:32.023
<v Speaker 1>there's other disciplinary strategies </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can use to that are more </v>

321
00:17:34.311 --> 00:17:35.420
<v Speaker 1>positive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

322
00:17:35.421 --> 00:17:37.490
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that you can do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

323
00:17:37.491 --> 00:17:38.324
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say you want to get your child to </v>

324
00:17:41.031 --> 00:17:43.130
<v Speaker 1>go to bed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a really good idea,</v>

325
00:17:43.131 --> 00:17:45.500
<v Speaker 1>you should set a stable bedtime for your</v>
<v Speaker 1>child.</v>

326
00:17:45.501 --> 00:17:46.334
<v Speaker 1>And I would say if they're under four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it should be around or seven or </v>

327
00:17:50.071 --> 00:17:50.904
<v Speaker 1>something like that because you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a life and you want to have a life </v>

328
00:17:53.101 --> 00:17:56.460
<v Speaker 1>with your wife so that you don't end up </v>
<v Speaker 1>hating your child.</v>

329
00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:57.773
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things you can do if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to train your child to go to </v>

330
00:18:00.331 --> 00:18:01.164
<v Speaker 1>bed at eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so maybe he's not going to bed until 10 </v>

331
00:18:03.811 --> 00:18:06.180
<v Speaker 1>right now and you want to fix that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you say,</v>

332
00:18:06.181 --> 00:18:07.014
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to the grocery store or a little </v>

333
00:18:08.581 --> 00:18:12.240
<v Speaker 1>convenience store and buy 10 little </v>
<v Speaker 1>gifts and it can be cheap.</v>

334
00:18:12.241 --> 00:18:14.040
<v Speaker 1>Kids don't care,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not very bright,</v>

335
00:18:14.041 --> 00:18:14.874
<v Speaker 1>you know you can fool them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So by 10 little things that you think </v>

336
00:18:17.371 --> 00:18:21.570
<v Speaker 1>your kid would like and wrap them up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then put them up on a shelf where he can</v>

337
00:18:21.571 --> 00:18:24.120
<v Speaker 1>see them but can't get out them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you say,</v>

338
00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:25.463
<v Speaker 1>look kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to put you to bed at nine 30 </v>

339
00:18:26.791 --> 00:18:27.624
<v Speaker 1>tonight and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't get out of bed then I'm </v>

340
00:18:31.531 --> 00:18:34.620
<v Speaker 1>going to give you one of these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to give you one of these gifts</v>

341
00:18:34.621 --> 00:18:35.454
<v Speaker 1>in the morning.</v>

342
00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:37.390
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or if the,</v>

343
00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:38.303
<v Speaker 1>or you can do it another way too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the child is always giving you a </v>

344
00:18:40.111 --> 00:18:42.160
<v Speaker 1>rough time about getting ready for bed </v>
<v Speaker 1>and going to bed,</v>

345
00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:42.811
<v Speaker 1>you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

346
00:18:42.811 --> 00:18:43.644
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you put on your pajamas without </v>

347
00:18:45.511 --> 00:18:46.344
<v Speaker 1>fussing and you climb into bed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I'll give you one of these little </v>

348
00:18:48.841 --> 00:18:51.270
<v Speaker 1>gifts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then if that works,</v>

349
00:18:51.271 --> 00:18:52.104
<v Speaker 1>then the child can have a little gift </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's in bed at nine 30 and then you </v>

350
00:18:54.691 --> 00:18:55.524
<v Speaker 1>can make it nine and then you can make </v>
<v Speaker 1>it eight 30 and then you can make it </v>

351
00:18:57.571 --> 00:19:00.870
<v Speaker 1>eight and those are called,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's called success of approximation,</v>

352
00:19:00.871 --> 00:19:01.890
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You hit the target,</v>

353
00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:02.753
<v Speaker 1>you specify the target that you want the</v>
<v Speaker 1>child to achieve and then use small </v>

354
00:19:06.331 --> 00:19:10.170
<v Speaker 1>rewards not too often in order to attain</v>
<v Speaker 1>that goal.</v>

355
00:19:10.171 --> 00:19:11.004
<v Speaker 1>And those are unbelievably effective </v>
<v Speaker 1>strategies and they can actually be </v>

356
00:19:13.501 --> 00:19:14.334
<v Speaker 1>pretty fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I would say the advice to not let </v>

357
00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:19.860
<v Speaker 1>your child do anything that makes you </v>
<v Speaker 1>dislike them is really,</v>

358
00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:22.620
<v Speaker 1>really useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

359
00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:23.723
<v Speaker 1>you want to talk this over with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>partner too so that you have your </v>

360
00:19:25.621 --> 00:19:26.454
<v Speaker 1>disciplinary strategies and your rules </v>
<v Speaker 1>talked out so that you don't work at </v>

361
00:19:29.971 --> 00:19:32.190
<v Speaker 1>cross purposes to one another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

362
00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:34.980
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's probably good enough for that.</v>

363
00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:38.820
<v Speaker 1>Can we take the biblical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Andrew Wells asks,</v>

364
00:19:38.821 --> 00:19:39.654
<v Speaker 1>can we take the biblical story seriously</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough with us without also keeping </v>

365
00:19:42.841 --> 00:19:46.650
<v Speaker 1>biblical traditions?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the psychological impact of group</v>

366
00:19:46.651 --> 00:19:48.150
<v Speaker 1>gathering church going?</v>

367
00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:55.140
<v Speaker 1>I think we could take the biblical </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories seriously enough,</v>

368
00:19:55.141 --> 00:19:58.230
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think that it's particularly</v>
<v Speaker 1>easy.</v>

369
00:19:58.860 --> 00:19:59.693
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the traditions bind the community </v>

370
00:20:01.701 --> 00:20:02.534
<v Speaker 1>gather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm saying that and I don't go to </v>

371
00:20:03.721 --> 00:20:05.010
<v Speaker 1>church,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

372
00:20:05.011 --> 00:20:05.844
<v Speaker 1>and the reason I don't go to church is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because while it drives me crazy to </v>

373
00:20:08.821 --> 00:20:09.690
<v Speaker 1>speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frankly,</v>

374
00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:10.613
<v Speaker 1>I haven't been able to sit in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation like that ever since I was </v>

375
00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:15.450
<v Speaker 1>well ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

376
00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:18.630
<v Speaker 1>That's really the truth of it ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

377
00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:23.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm not convinced that that's a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing because I do believe,</v>

378
00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:26.460
<v Speaker 1>and I've had good conversations about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this with Jonathan Patio,</v>

379
00:20:26.461 --> 00:20:27.294
<v Speaker 1>I do believe that communal return to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>source of the community's ethics is </v>

380
00:20:32.761 --> 00:20:33.594
<v Speaker 1>actually a necessary thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe I'm atoning for my past sins </v>

381
00:20:37.771 --> 00:20:39.720
<v Speaker 1>by doing these biblical lectures at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment,</v>

382
00:20:39.721 --> 00:20:41.940
<v Speaker 1>which is something that's communal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

383
00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:43.193
<v Speaker 1>and then because there's also something </v>
<v Speaker 1>about going where a bunch of other </v>

384
00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:50.290
<v Speaker 1>people are to reaffirm your commitment </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

385
00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:52.870
<v Speaker 1>to the good that you're also all aiming </v>
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>

386
00:20:52.871 --> 00:20:54.670
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's got some power in it.</v>

387
00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:55.503
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't think that that's something </v>

388
00:20:57.071 --> 00:20:59.410
<v Speaker 1>that we should forgo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's dangerous.</v>

389
00:20:59.411 --> 00:21:00.244
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

390
00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:01.293
<v Speaker 1>even if you're cynical about church,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I guess I would put myself in that </v>

391
00:21:03.851 --> 00:21:05.770
<v Speaker 1>category,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

392
00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:10.570
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly the case that communal </v>
<v Speaker 1>church going in the 1950s say,</v>

393
00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:11.763
<v Speaker 1>provided the average person with at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least an hour a week where they were </v>

394
00:21:14.831 --> 00:21:15.664
<v Speaker 1>contemplating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter how poorly the purpose of </v>

395
00:21:21.251 --> 00:21:22.084
<v Speaker 1>ethics in life and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the idea of a higher purpose in a </v>

396
00:21:24.761 --> 00:21:25.594
<v Speaker 1>higher meaning in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you gotta think that spending an </v>

397
00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:30.760
<v Speaker 1>hour a week thinking about that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>better than never doing it at all.</v>

398
00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:31.923
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know how to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that tradition can be revivified in a </v>

399
00:21:35.471 --> 00:21:37.300
<v Speaker 1>meaningful way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's,</v>

400
00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:40.570
<v Speaker 1>I really do think it's a catastrophe </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we've lost it because we don't have</v>

401
00:21:40.571 --> 00:21:41.404
<v Speaker 1>a center,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an ethical center that holds our </v>

402
00:21:43.751 --> 00:21:44.584
<v Speaker 1>community together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the consequence of that is that </v>

403
00:21:46.151 --> 00:21:47.740
<v Speaker 1>we're fragmenting quite badly.</v>

404
00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:53.010
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>Edwin Raj Kumar says,</v>

405
00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:54.423
<v Speaker 1>I was wondering what your thoughts are </v>
<v Speaker 1>on meditation and if you practice it </v>

406
00:21:57.131 --> 00:21:58.660
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

407
00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:03.900
<v Speaker 1>that's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I practice it a lot and look,</v>

408
00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:09.190
<v Speaker 1>when I listened to someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or even when I listened to myself,</v>

409
00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:13.120
<v Speaker 1>but let's say when I listened to someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my clinical practice,</v>

410
00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:14.193
<v Speaker 1>I think I do it in a meditative way in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I sit and listen and I wait for </v>

411
00:22:19.511 --> 00:22:22.840
<v Speaker 1>thoughts to appear rather than </v>
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily thinking.</v>

412
00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:27.910
<v Speaker 1>So I clear my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try to keep my agenda's off the table,</v>

413
00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:29.530
<v Speaker 1>my agendas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever they are,</v>

414
00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:30.393
<v Speaker 1>except that I want the best for my </v>
<v Speaker 1>client in this hour and the best say by </v>

415
00:22:34.301 --> 00:22:35.134
<v Speaker 1>their definition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And mine jointly decided because that's </v>

416
00:22:37.391 --> 00:22:38.224
<v Speaker 1>all part of discussion and then I </v>
<v Speaker 1>listened very carefully and I wait for </v>

417
00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:46.600
<v Speaker 1>the reactions that occur within me and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then I share them.</v>

418
00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:48.580
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's a meditative </v>
<v Speaker 1>exercise.</v>

419
00:22:48.581 --> 00:22:50.590
<v Speaker 1>I think it's different than voluntary </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>

420
00:22:50.591 --> 00:22:51.424
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know there's a statement in the new </v>

421
00:22:52.901 --> 00:22:57.901
<v Speaker 1>testament that says a knock and the door</v>
<v Speaker 1>will open asking you will receive.</v>

422
00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:02.530
<v Speaker 1>Now</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a meditative,</v>

423
00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:04.353
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a call to a meditative mode of </v>

424
00:23:06.011 --> 00:23:07.420
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

425
00:23:07.421 --> 00:23:11.620
<v Speaker 1>well often what I do for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I want to solve a problem is I,</v>

426
00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:12.993
<v Speaker 1>if I have a problem with my own behavior</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe I'm having problems in my </v>

427
00:23:16.091 --> 00:23:19.690
<v Speaker 1>family is all go sit on a bed or a chair</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they'll think,</v>

428
00:23:19.691 --> 00:23:22.840
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like an answer to this.</v>

429
00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:24.153
<v Speaker 1>I would like to know what the answer to </v>
<v Speaker 1>this and I'm willing to accept whatever </v>

430
00:23:26.621 --> 00:23:31.621
<v Speaker 1>answer is appropriate and cause usually </v>
<v Speaker 1>you get an answer that you don't like.</v>

431
00:23:31.831 --> 00:23:32.980
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's a real answer,</v>

432
00:23:32.981 --> 00:23:33.814
<v Speaker 1>it's not something that you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be all that happy about and then </v>

433
00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:39.520
<v Speaker 1>magically so to speak and answer </v>
<v Speaker 1>appears.</v>

434
00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:41.750
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's a meditative practice</v>
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

435
00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:44.343
<v Speaker 1>the meditative practice is part to clear</v>
<v Speaker 1>your mind of your proximal concerns and </v>

436
00:23:50.931 --> 00:23:51.764
<v Speaker 1>to concentrate more deeply on what might</v>
<v Speaker 1>be regarded as eternally true and to </v>

437
00:23:56.991 --> 00:24:01.991
<v Speaker 1>open yourself up for a revelation in </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to what is eternally true.</v>

438
00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:07.580
<v Speaker 1>And I found that incredibly effective </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that you can live like that.</v>

439
00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:09.133
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just have to abandon your proximal </v>

440
00:24:12.801 --> 00:24:14.360
<v Speaker 1>pursuits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now in my new book,</v>

441
00:24:14.361 --> 00:24:15.194
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote a chapter about that called do </v>

442
00:24:17.091 --> 00:24:17.924
<v Speaker 1>what is meaningful and what not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is expedient and it's a bit of a </v>

443
00:24:20.991 --> 00:24:21.824
<v Speaker 1>meditation on the sermon on the mount,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say because of the essential </v>

444
00:24:24.801 --> 00:24:25.634
<v Speaker 1>message in the sermon on the Mount,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the foundational document of </v>

445
00:24:28.221 --> 00:24:30.250
<v Speaker 1>Western civilization as far as I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned,</v>

446
00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:31.103
<v Speaker 1>essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you should orient yourself </v>

447
00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:39.200
<v Speaker 1>ultimately towards the highest good that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can conceive.</v>

448
00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:40.303
<v Speaker 1>And I've tried to formulate that and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentioned earlier in this q and a that </v>

449
00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:44.413
<v Speaker 1>the highest good that you can conceive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it should be something like what would </v>

450
00:24:47.511 --> 00:24:48.344
<v Speaker 1>be good for you now and good for you </v>
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow and next week and next month </v>

451
00:24:51.831 --> 00:24:52.664
<v Speaker 1>and next year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So good for you and all the future use </v>

452
00:24:54.681 --> 00:24:58.130
<v Speaker 1>that might exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also at the same time,</v>

453
00:24:58.131 --> 00:25:01.190
<v Speaker 1>good for your family and good for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>community,</v>

454
00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:02.623
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize narrowly and broadly and </v>

455
00:25:05.541 --> 00:25:08.780
<v Speaker 1>good now for your family and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>community and then also into the future.</v>

456
00:25:08.781 --> 00:25:10.100
<v Speaker 1>So it's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

457
00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:13.490
<v Speaker 1>it's a balance of goods that stretches </v>
<v Speaker 1>across time and you,</v>

458
00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:15.830
<v Speaker 1>you have to decide if that's what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>really want.</v>

459
00:25:15.831 --> 00:25:16.664
<v Speaker 1>And my sense would be you haven't gotten</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything better to aim at and that you </v>

460
00:25:20.211 --> 00:25:22.190
<v Speaker 1>should aim at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The best thing that you can aim at for a</v>

461
00:25:22.191 --> 00:25:23.190
<v Speaker 1>whole bunch of reasons.</v>

462
00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:27.530
<v Speaker 1>One is if you don't aim at something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're certainly not going to attain it.</v>

463
00:25:27.531 --> 00:25:28.364
<v Speaker 1>And if you're going to aim at something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why not aim for the best thing that you </v>

464
00:25:30.711 --> 00:25:31.544
<v Speaker 1>can think of?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you do aim for the best thing </v>

465
00:25:33.621 --> 00:25:36.110
<v Speaker 1>that you can think of and you make any </v>
<v Speaker 1>progress whatsoever,</v>

466
00:25:36.111 --> 00:25:39.950
<v Speaker 1>it's extremely exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you do aim for the best thing you</v>

467
00:25:39.951 --> 00:25:40.784
<v Speaker 1>can take up and you make some progress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's very life affirming and </v>

468
00:25:43.821 --> 00:25:47.690
<v Speaker 1>validating and that sort of quells your </v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety and your existential pain.</v>

469
00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:51.910
<v Speaker 1>And so he get yourself properly oriented</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

470
00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:52.863
<v Speaker 1>and the sermon on the mount basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>suggest that you do that by orienting </v>

471
00:25:56.061 --> 00:25:59.360
<v Speaker 1>yourself towards God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for the psychological purposes,</v>

472
00:25:59.361 --> 00:26:00.194
<v Speaker 1>we could conceptualize God as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>highest good that you can conceive of </v>

473
00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:08.030
<v Speaker 1>and then you concentrate on the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you can get up in the morning and</v>

474
00:26:08.031 --> 00:26:08.864
<v Speaker 1>you can think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

475
00:26:09.050 --> 00:26:11.570
<v Speaker 1>I want the best possible thing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

476
00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:15.680
<v Speaker 1>And so what is it that I should do to </v>
<v Speaker 1>serve that?</v>

477
00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:19.250
<v Speaker 1>And if you ask that genuinely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's an a meditative way,</v>

478
00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:21.440
<v Speaker 1>I will say you get an answer to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>right away.</v>

479
00:26:21.441 --> 00:26:22.274
<v Speaker 1>Now the problem is is that it's usually </v>
<v Speaker 1>an answer that involves some kind of </v>

480
00:26:24.801 --> 00:26:25.634
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means that instead of doing what you </v>

481
00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:28.693
<v Speaker 1>would like to do impulsively right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're more likely to have to go do </v>

482
00:26:31.911 --> 00:26:33.050
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

483
00:26:33.051 --> 00:26:35.120
<v Speaker 1>that you've been avoiding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's difficult.</v>

484
00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:39.380
<v Speaker 1>But if you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you'll have some,</v>

485
00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:42.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can also leave in your day with some</v>

486
00:26:42.081 --> 00:26:43.350
<v Speaker 1>pleasure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

487
00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:45.720
<v Speaker 1>to reward yourself for doing something </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult.</v>

488
00:26:45.721 --> 00:26:47.310
<v Speaker 1>But if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you live that way,</v>

489
00:26:47.311 --> 00:26:48.144
<v Speaker 1>then I think that your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your house stays clean and your family </v>

490
00:26:50.341 --> 00:26:54.210
<v Speaker 1>stays organized and the state doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>rock and all that.</v>

491
00:26:54.211 --> 00:26:56.520
<v Speaker 1>And all that's extremely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely good.</v>

492
00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:57.833
<v Speaker 1>So anonymous says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do I deal with the fact that I'm a </v>

493
00:27:01.201 --> 00:27:04.410
<v Speaker 1>pedophile and should I tell my family </v>
<v Speaker 1>and friends it?</v>

494
00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:07.860
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't answer the second part of that.</v>

495
00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:08.723
<v Speaker 1>Should I tell my family and friends </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I don't know your family and </v>

496
00:27:11.191 --> 00:27:14.250
<v Speaker 1>friends and I don't know how you would </v>
<v Speaker 1>go about telling them.</v>

497
00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:15.323
<v Speaker 1>So I can't make a piece of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't make any advice about that or I </v>

498
00:27:18.061 --> 00:27:20.460
<v Speaker 1>can't offer you any advice about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

499
00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:23.900
<v Speaker 1>I would say that if you have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity,</v>

500
00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:24.773
<v Speaker 1>you should probably go speak to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>counselor or priest or someone that you </v>

501
00:27:27.211 --> 00:27:28.044
<v Speaker 1>trust</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're going to have to figure </v>

502
00:27:31.231 --> 00:27:34.020
<v Speaker 1>out how to deal with that and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you should also maybe,</v>

503
00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:35.790
<v Speaker 1>and that's about the best I can do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

504
00:27:35.791 --> 00:27:38.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm not an expert in the treatment of </v>
<v Speaker 1>pedophilia.</v>

505
00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:41.430
<v Speaker 1>And so I can't offer you any great </v>
<v Speaker 1>clinical wisdom,</v>

506
00:27:41.431 --> 00:27:46.431
<v Speaker 1>but I would say that you need a plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to plan and you have to,</v>

507
00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:48.053
<v Speaker 1>and I would include in that plan the </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely catastrophic consequences of </v>

508
00:27:52.351 --> 00:27:54.510
<v Speaker 1>not regulating that behavior properly.</v>

509
00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:58.950
<v Speaker 1>And you should really think it through </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that pedophilic impulse,</v>

510
00:27:58.951 --> 00:28:02.040
<v Speaker 1>let's say could lead you into seven </v>
<v Speaker 1>different sorts of hell.</v>

511
00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:04.470
<v Speaker 1>You and whoever you happen to tangle up </v>
<v Speaker 1>in it.</v>

512
00:28:04.471 --> 00:28:09.471
<v Speaker 1>And you might want to avoid severn diff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might want to avoid seven different,</v>

513
00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:14.040
<v Speaker 1>seven different forms of hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in order to do that,</v>

514
00:28:14.041 --> 00:28:14.874
<v Speaker 1>given the proclivity that you described,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to have to have a </v>

515
00:28:17.251 --> 00:28:18.570
<v Speaker 1>plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now look,</v>

516
00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:21.750
<v Speaker 1>lots of people have impulses that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a hard time controlling.</v>

517
00:28:21.751 --> 00:28:22.584
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alcoholics can't drink alcohol and </v>

518
00:28:24.031 --> 00:28:24.864
<v Speaker 1>cocaine addicts can't take cocaine and </v>
<v Speaker 1>most people can't what manifest on </v>

519
00:28:29.511 --> 00:28:30.344
<v Speaker 1>trammeled sexual behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it certainly within the capacity </v>

520
00:28:35.851 --> 00:28:36.684
<v Speaker 1>of human beings to regulate impulses </v>
<v Speaker 1>that aren't in there or other's best </v>

521
00:28:39.901 --> 00:28:40.734
<v Speaker 1>interests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I wouldn't regard it as a hopeless </v>

522
00:28:42.061 --> 00:28:42.894
<v Speaker 1>pursuit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it does seem to me that it's </v>

523
00:28:44.161 --> 00:28:47.730
<v Speaker 1>something that you might want to talk to</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone you trust about because it's,</v>

524
00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:49.103
<v Speaker 1>it's a complicated issue and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>proclivity that's likely to lead you in </v>

525
00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:58.440
<v Speaker 1>a direction that would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's call it sub optimal.</v>

526
00:29:00.570 --> 00:29:02.640
<v Speaker 1>I was wondering what you thought of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Santa Clause,</v>

527
00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:05.550
<v Speaker 1>if it's a healthy thing for parents to </v>
<v Speaker 1>practice,</v>

528
00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:09.090
<v Speaker 1>what's the psychological impact of lying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to your child?</v>

529
00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:11.340
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the,</v>

530
00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:14.700
<v Speaker 1>I think lying is the wrong way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about this.</v>

531
00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:18.990
<v Speaker 1>Santa Claus is a game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a game of pretend and children play</v>

532
00:29:18.991 --> 00:29:21.450
<v Speaker 1>games of pretend all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

533
00:29:21.451 --> 00:29:24.720
<v Speaker 1>so I don't see any harm in it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

534
00:29:24.721 --> 00:29:25.554
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to prolong that belief </v>

535
00:29:28.711 --> 00:29:31.270
<v Speaker 1>beyond its natural end point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's a,</v>

536
00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:34.150
<v Speaker 1>it's a massive game and it's a lovely </v>
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>

537
00:29:34.151 --> 00:29:38.070
<v Speaker 1>And I don't believe that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything harmful in it in the least.</v>

538
00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:42.370
<v Speaker 1>So now what's the psychological impact </v>
<v Speaker 1>lying to your child?</v>

539
00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:44.830
<v Speaker 1>Let's we can think about that more </v>
<v Speaker 1>generally.</v>

540
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:47.470
<v Speaker 1>Don't lie to your children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't lie.</v>

541
00:29:47.471 --> 00:29:49.810
<v Speaker 1>Period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lying is a really bad idea.</v>

542
00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:52.000
<v Speaker 1>It's a really bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

543
00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:54.610
<v Speaker 1>it never works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might think it works,</v>

544
00:29:54.611 --> 00:29:55.444
<v Speaker 1>but that's only because you're blind to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the consequences and probably willfully </v>

545
00:29:58.091 --> 00:30:00.160
<v Speaker 1>blind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus it's a terrible weight.</v>

546
00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:01.023
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

547
00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:03.610
<v Speaker 1>if you don't lie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot fewer things to keep track</v>

548
00:30:03.611 --> 00:30:04.444
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your life is a lot more pristine and </v>

549
00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:06.970
<v Speaker 1>crystally and,</v>

550
00:30:09.890 --> 00:30:10.723
<v Speaker 1>and then things that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that come your way maybe you deserve in </v>

551
00:30:13.431 --> 00:30:17.240
<v Speaker 1>some small measure and it's a bad idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>to lie now,</v>

552
00:30:17.241 --> 00:30:20.330
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think it's a bad idea to </v>
<v Speaker 1>play pretend games with your children.</v>

553
00:30:20.331 --> 00:30:21.164
<v Speaker 1>I think that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You once mentioned you were planning on </v>

554
00:30:24.051 --> 00:30:27.620
<v Speaker 1>making an Iq test available alongside </v>
<v Speaker 1>the big five aspects scale.</v>

555
00:30:27.621 --> 00:30:28.640
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that in the works?</v>

556
00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:29.803
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have an Iq test that we use for </v>

557
00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:34.370
<v Speaker 1>business testing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

558
00:30:34.550 --> 00:30:37.130
<v Speaker 1>although we haven't made it available </v>
<v Speaker 1>publicly yet.</v>

559
00:30:37.450 --> 00:30:41.180
<v Speaker 1>It is in the works but not for a while </v>
<v Speaker 1>what we're doing instead.</v>

560
00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:43.010
<v Speaker 1>And that's because it has to be,</v>

561
00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:48.530
<v Speaker 1>well there's a bunch of work we still </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to do on it to generate the reports</v>

562
00:30:48.531 --> 00:30:50.810
<v Speaker 1>so that they're going to be truly usable</v>
<v Speaker 1>to people.</v>

563
00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:51.773
<v Speaker 1>Now that I would say it's about three or</v>
<v Speaker 1>four months work is necessary to do </v>

564
00:30:54.261 --> 00:30:55.400
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

565
00:30:56.270 --> 00:30:59.060
<v Speaker 1>what we are doing right now with the big</v>
<v Speaker 1>five aspects scale though,</v>

566
00:30:59.061 --> 00:30:59.894
<v Speaker 1>so that's that understand myself.com is </v>
<v Speaker 1>producing a dyad version and so we're </v>

567
00:31:04.941 --> 00:31:07.340
<v Speaker 1>working on the boyfriend girlfriend </v>
<v Speaker 1>version right now.</v>

568
00:31:07.341 --> 00:31:08.174
<v Speaker 1>So what that'll mean is that when you go</v>
<v Speaker 1>there and you do your personality test </v>

569
00:31:11.301 --> 00:31:13.910
<v Speaker 1>and your girlfriend say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does her personality test,</v>

570
00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:15.043
<v Speaker 1>that you'll both be able to generate a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dual report that describes the </v>

571
00:31:19.341 --> 00:31:23.720
<v Speaker 1>similarities and differences between you</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your partner and where you're likely</v>

572
00:31:23.721 --> 00:31:24.554
<v Speaker 1>to see eye to eye on things and where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're likely to defer and what that's </v>

573
00:31:27.081 --> 00:31:27.914
<v Speaker 1>going to mean and what you might want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do about it if you know what you might </v>

574
00:31:30.291 --> 00:31:31.400
<v Speaker 1>be able to do about it.</v>

575
00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:32.233
<v Speaker 1>And this we're hoping this will be </v>
<v Speaker 1>really useful because temperamental </v>

576
00:31:35.421 --> 00:31:36.254
<v Speaker 1>differences are a lot of the reason that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have a hard time getting along </v>

577
00:31:39.021 --> 00:31:39.854
<v Speaker 1>that and complete inability whatsoever </v>
<v Speaker 1>to state what they actually want and to </v>

578
00:31:44.301 --> 00:31:46.250
<v Speaker 1>negotiate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has a completely different issue.</v>

579
00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:47.263
<v Speaker 1>I want to build a program to help people</v>
<v Speaker 1>negotiate too at some point in the </v>

580
00:31:50.031 --> 00:31:51.800
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's part of our future plan.</v>

581
00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:52.933
<v Speaker 1>But the next development plan is to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there's two of them is to get the </v>

582
00:31:55.641 --> 00:31:56.474
<v Speaker 1>high school version of the self </v>
<v Speaker 1>authoring program up and running and </v>

583
00:31:59.930 --> 00:32:03.740
<v Speaker 1>that my program or keeps promising it in</v>
<v Speaker 1>two weeks and I,</v>

584
00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:05.113
<v Speaker 1>these things always take longer than </v>
<v Speaker 1>expected but I'm sure we'll get it out </v>

585
00:32:07.341 --> 00:32:08.174
<v Speaker 1>in the first quarter of 2018 and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>also the dyad version of the big five </v>

586
00:32:12.861 --> 00:32:14.260
<v Speaker 1>aspects scale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

587
00:32:14.450 --> 00:32:17.240
<v Speaker 1>that should be out in the first quarter </v>
<v Speaker 1>of 2018 as well.</v>

588
00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:21.020
<v Speaker 1>And then I'm not sure if the Iq test </v>
<v Speaker 1>will be next on the development track.</v>

589
00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:22.033
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things we'd like to do with </v>

590
00:32:24.051 --> 00:32:28.760
<v Speaker 1>understand myself is to expand it out </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a career,</v>

591
00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:32.360
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>planning process.</v>

592
00:32:32.361 --> 00:32:34.970
<v Speaker 1>Because look at it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

593
00:32:34.971 --> 00:32:38.000
<v Speaker 1>if you have an Iq of a hundred,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the average Iq,</v>

594
00:32:38.001 --> 00:32:41.390
<v Speaker 1>so that would place you sort of in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle of the average high school class.</v>

595
00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:42.553
<v Speaker 1>Being a lawyer is probably not a great </v>
<v Speaker 1>career choice for you unless you're </v>

596
00:32:45.681 --> 00:32:49.370
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably conscientious because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be competing with people</v>

597
00:32:49.371 --> 00:32:50.204
<v Speaker 1>who have a verbal facility say and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem solving capacity that far </v>

598
00:32:53.721 --> 00:32:54.554
<v Speaker 1>exceeds yours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're going to have to work like </v>

599
00:32:57.081 --> 00:32:57.914
<v Speaker 1>mad too to just be reasonably competent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what seems to be more logical is </v>

600
00:33:04.521 --> 00:33:09.521
<v Speaker 1>to take a good look at your intellectual</v>
<v Speaker 1>prowess as given cause it's,</v>

601
00:33:10.381 --> 00:33:14.900
<v Speaker 1>it's very powerfully biologically </v>
<v Speaker 1>influenced and to pick a domain of,</v>

602
00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:18.470
<v Speaker 1>of career that you could excel in.</v>

603
00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:21.380
<v Speaker 1>Because why not pick a domain that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can excel?</v>

604
00:33:21.381 --> 00:33:23.420
<v Speaker 1>And there's lots of different things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can be.</v>

605
00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:26.420
<v Speaker 1>And so you want to consult your </v>
<v Speaker 1>temperament.</v>

606
00:33:26.421 --> 00:33:27.254
<v Speaker 1>So if you're agreeable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you probably want to work with </v>

607
00:33:28.521 --> 00:33:29.840
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're disagreeable,</v>

608
00:33:29.841 --> 00:33:32.150
<v Speaker 1>you probably want to work with things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're extroverted,</v>

609
00:33:32.151 --> 00:33:35.300
<v Speaker 1>you want to have a job that involves </v>
<v Speaker 1>sales and social activity.</v>

610
00:33:35.301 --> 00:33:37.130
<v Speaker 1>And if you're introverted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to work alone.</v>

611
00:33:37.131 --> 00:33:37.964
<v Speaker 1>And if you're open,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to do something creative and </v>

612
00:33:39.261 --> 00:33:40.094
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurial and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have to consult your temperament </v>

613
00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:45.410
<v Speaker 1>to see where you would be properly </v>
<v Speaker 1>slotted.</v>

614
00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:46.453
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to consider your </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence so that you can find a </v>

615
00:33:49.191 --> 00:33:53.300
<v Speaker 1>niche where you're most likely to excel </v>
<v Speaker 1>and those niches exists.</v>

616
00:33:53.301 --> 00:33:54.430
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

617
00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:55.393
<v Speaker 1>we'd like to combine the Iq test with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the big five aspects scale so that we </v>

618
00:33:58.161 --> 00:34:00.500
<v Speaker 1>can give people reasonable career </v>
<v Speaker 1>advice.</v>

619
00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:01.333
<v Speaker 1>It's been a longterm goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so those are all on the table and I </v>

620
00:34:04.761 --> 00:34:05.594
<v Speaker 1>have good program team working on them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're very complicated things and </v>

621
00:34:08.331 --> 00:34:11.270
<v Speaker 1>they take a lot of time and we don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to make a mistake and all of that.</v>

622
00:34:11.271 --> 00:34:12.104
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe the couple's version and the </v>

623
00:34:13.911 --> 00:34:17.750
<v Speaker 1>high school version of the couple's </v>
<v Speaker 1>version of the personality test and high</v>

624
00:34:17.751 --> 00:34:18.584
<v Speaker 1>school version of the self authoring in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this quarter and maybe maybe the career </v>

625
00:34:24.350 --> 00:34:27.650
<v Speaker 1>counseling version of the big five </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspects scale in the next year.</v>

626
00:34:27.651 --> 00:34:28.900
<v Speaker 1>That would be lovely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

627
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.700
<v Speaker 1>that's probably overly optimistic for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the second part,</v>

628
00:34:31.701 --> 00:34:35.480
<v Speaker 1>but</v>
<v Speaker 1>you often give advice to young adults to</v>

629
00:34:35.481 --> 00:34:37.580
<v Speaker 1>help them avoid some of the pitfalls of </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

630
00:34:37.670 --> 00:34:40.880
<v Speaker 1>Any advice for those of us who are 40 </v>
<v Speaker 1>plus who have already faltered?</v>

631
00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:43.820
<v Speaker 1>Look first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Graham,</v>

632
00:34:43.821 --> 00:34:44.654
<v Speaker 1>this is Graham.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody who is 40 pluses has already </v>

633
00:34:47.181 --> 00:34:48.014
<v Speaker 1>faulted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

634
00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:49.153
<v Speaker 1>but I'm presuming that you mean faltered</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a manner that appears to you to be </v>

635
00:34:53.121 --> 00:34:54.980
<v Speaker 1>above out above the average,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

636
00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:59.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I would really recommend is I think</v>

637
00:34:59.481 --> 00:35:00.860
<v Speaker 1>that you should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you haven't already,</v>

638
00:35:00.861 --> 00:35:01.694
<v Speaker 1>you should go do the future authoring </v>
<v Speaker 1>program and maybe the past authoring </v>

639
00:35:03.741 --> 00:35:04.574
<v Speaker 1>program too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you should figure out exactly </v>

640
00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:08.053
<v Speaker 1>how you faltered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what exactly did you do wrong by </v>

641
00:35:11.091 --> 00:35:13.910
<v Speaker 1>your own buy your own analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

642
00:35:13.911 --> 00:35:16.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what social rules did you break?</v>

643
00:35:16.611 --> 00:35:18.500
<v Speaker 1>Although that's not a bad initial </v>
<v Speaker 1>guideline.</v>

644
00:35:18.501 --> 00:35:21.590
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in the self authoring suite,</v>

645
00:35:21.591 --> 00:35:22.424
<v Speaker 1>there's a past authoring module and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>asks you to break your life I to 70 </v>

646
00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:26.113
<v Speaker 1>parks and then to consider the </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotionally significant or practically </v>

647
00:35:29.721 --> 00:35:32.900
<v Speaker 1>significant events within each epoch and</v>
<v Speaker 1>detail out there,</v>

648
00:35:32.901 --> 00:35:35.150
<v Speaker 1>emotional nature and their consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so on.</v>

649
00:35:35.151 --> 00:35:37.470
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things you might want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out is,</v>

650
00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:39.480
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you say that you faltered,</v>

651
00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:42.180
<v Speaker 1>like what do you mean exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>

652
00:35:42.181 --> 00:35:45.870
<v Speaker 1>exactly go over your life with a fine </v>
<v Speaker 1>tooth comb.</v>

653
00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:48.300
<v Speaker 1>This is what Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn did </v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

654
00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:50.970
<v Speaker 1>in the ghoulag before he wrote the Gulag</v>
<v Speaker 1>archipelago,</v>

655
00:35:50.971 --> 00:35:52.500
<v Speaker 1>he went over his life and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

656
00:35:52.501 --> 00:35:56.100
<v Speaker 1>well like where did I go wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did I squander?</v>

657
00:35:56.101 --> 00:35:58.500
<v Speaker 1>What mistakes did I make and what did I </v>
<v Speaker 1>do right?</v>

658
00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:01.950
<v Speaker 1>So that you can orient yourself now and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you want to think,</v>

659
00:36:01.951 --> 00:36:04.350
<v Speaker 1>and this is why we built the future </v>
<v Speaker 1>authoring program.</v>

660
00:36:04.351 --> 00:36:06.660
<v Speaker 1>Well look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got 40 years left,</v>

661
00:36:06.661 --> 00:36:09.480
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do you want them to be like?</v>

662
00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:12.060
<v Speaker 1>So what do you want to aim at?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

663
00:36:12.061 --> 00:36:15.110
<v Speaker 1>at least how are you going to minimize </v>
<v Speaker 1>the misery if,</v>

664
00:36:15.111 --> 00:36:16.500
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if nothing else.</v>

665
00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:17.753
<v Speaker 1>And so you need a plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then what you need to do is to </v>

666
00:36:20.071 --> 00:36:20.904
<v Speaker 1>figure out how to work day to day so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you incrementally approach that </v>

667
00:36:25.501 --> 00:36:26.334
<v Speaker 1>plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I have another chapter in this new </v>

668
00:36:27.691 --> 00:36:28.870
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

669
00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:30.053
<v Speaker 1>called compare yourself to who you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>yesterday rather than to who someone </v>

670
00:36:33.061 --> 00:36:33.894
<v Speaker 1>else's today.</v>

671
00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:34.853
<v Speaker 1>That's really a useful psychological </v>
<v Speaker 1>stance for someone who's 30 and over in </v>

672
00:36:39.811 --> 00:36:40.644
<v Speaker 1>particular took 20 year olds can still </v>
<v Speaker 1>kinda compare themselves to other 20 </v>

673
00:36:43.651 --> 00:36:46.380
<v Speaker 1>year olds because all 20 year olds in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some way are the same,</v>

674
00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:47.543
<v Speaker 1>but 40 year olds are really different </v>
<v Speaker 1>from each other and sore 30 year olds </v>

675
00:36:49.831 --> 00:36:52.140
<v Speaker 1>for that matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might think,</v>

676
00:36:52.141 --> 00:36:52.974
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well</v>

677
00:36:55.310 --> 00:36:56.143
<v Speaker 1>here's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a meditative strategy for for </v>

678
00:36:58.170 --> 00:36:59.003
<v Speaker 1>ceasing to falter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could wake up in the morning or you </v>

679
00:37:01.261 --> 00:37:03.390
<v Speaker 1>could do this at night before you go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>bed and you could think,</v>

680
00:37:03.391 --> 00:37:04.224
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

681
00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:07.410
<v Speaker 1>I want to structure my day to moral so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that when I,</v>

682
00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:13.220
<v Speaker 1>when I'm done with the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my life is in slightly better order than</v>

683
00:37:14.011 --> 00:37:19.011
<v Speaker 1>it was when I woke up this morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just slightly better because incremental</v>

684
00:37:19.591 --> 00:37:20.424
<v Speaker 1>progress is massively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>massively effective because it bears a </v>

685
00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:27.660
<v Speaker 1>exponential fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just like a bank account,</v>

686
00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:29.730
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>compounds,</v>

687
00:37:30.210 --> 00:37:32.490
<v Speaker 1>incremental progress compounds with </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

688
00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:34.470
<v Speaker 1>So you can get up in the morning and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could think,</v>

689
00:37:34.471 --> 00:37:35.304
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some things in my life that I </v>

690
00:37:36.571 --> 00:37:39.300
<v Speaker 1>could put in order today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're usually things you don't want to</v>

691
00:37:39.301 --> 00:37:40.470
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As I mentioned earlier,</v>

692
00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:45.710
<v Speaker 1>what could I do today that would help </v>
<v Speaker 1>put my life in order that I would do?</v>

693
00:37:47.310 --> 00:37:49.410
<v Speaker 1>You have to ask yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't tell yourself.</v>

694
00:37:49.411 --> 00:37:51.690
<v Speaker 1>You have to ask yourself what would you </v>
<v Speaker 1>do?</v>

695
00:37:51.810 --> 00:37:53.460
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe you have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

696
00:37:53.610 --> 00:37:56.790
<v Speaker 1>or maybe you have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>under what conditions would I be willing</v>

697
00:37:56.791 --> 00:37:59.820
<v Speaker 1>to do something to put my life in </v>
<v Speaker 1>further ordered today?</v>

698
00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:02.040
<v Speaker 1>What little reward would I need to give </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself?</v>

699
00:38:02.041 --> 00:38:06.180
<v Speaker 1>And these have to be questions you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>like take out the whip and boss yourself</v>

700
00:38:06.181 --> 00:38:09.390
<v Speaker 1>around because you'll find that you're a</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible master and a worst slave.</v>

701
00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:13.740
<v Speaker 1>And so you can get along ways if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>look low enough.</v>

702
00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:16.350
<v Speaker 1>One of the things Carl Jung said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I really liked,</v>

703
00:38:16.351 --> 00:38:19.470
<v Speaker 1>was that modern people don't see God </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they don't look low enough.</v>

704
00:38:19.471 --> 00:38:20.304
<v Speaker 1>They don't have the humility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you said that you have already </v>

705
00:38:22.651 --> 00:38:23.484
<v Speaker 1>faulted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it sounds like you've got the </v>

706
00:38:24.481 --> 00:38:25.314
<v Speaker 1>humility already intact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would say think about what you </v>

707
00:38:28.921 --> 00:38:29.754
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about what you know around you </v>

708
00:38:31.981 --> 00:38:32.814
<v Speaker 1>isn't set right cause you'll know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make a list of things that are around </v>

709
00:38:36.941 --> 00:38:37.774
<v Speaker 1>you that aren't right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then start thinking about small </v>

710
00:38:40.571 --> 00:38:41.404
<v Speaker 1>things you can do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like trivial things that even a fool </v>

711
00:38:43.571 --> 00:38:44.404
<v Speaker 1>like yourself could manage that would </v>
<v Speaker 1>orient you in the right direction and </v>

712
00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:48.933
<v Speaker 1>help straighten out your life and try </v>
<v Speaker 1>that for a year before you decide that </v>

713
00:38:51.641 --> 00:38:52.870
<v Speaker 1>you're a failure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

714
00:38:53.290 --> 00:38:56.290
<v Speaker 1>Because you'll find that if you put that</v>
<v Speaker 1>into practice for a year,</v>

715
00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:59.440
<v Speaker 1>that things will be a lot better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like I said,</v>

716
00:38:59.441 --> 00:39:02.110
<v Speaker 1>you got 40 years left so you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not done yet.</v>

717
00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:03.460
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

718
00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:05.063
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

719
00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:06.560
<v Speaker 1>The other thing I would say too is,</v>

720
00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:07.863
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

721
00:39:08.570 --> 00:39:11.660
<v Speaker 1>it isn't exactly that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say forgive yourself because you</v>

722
00:39:11.661 --> 00:39:12.800
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just a cliche.</v>

723
00:39:12.801 --> 00:39:15.290
<v Speaker 1>But I would say that once you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>decided,</v>

724
00:39:15.291 --> 00:39:19.700
<v Speaker 1>once you what you've done wrong and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've put into practice some,</v>

725
00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:23.630
<v Speaker 1>some strategies to rectify that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that don't,</v>

726
00:39:23.631 --> 00:39:27.830
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to beat yourself any more</v>
<v Speaker 1>than is necessary for you to learn.</v>

727
00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:31.910
<v Speaker 1>Which is a good rule of thumb with </v>
<v Speaker 1>regards to treating yourself and also to</v>

728
00:39:31.911 --> 00:39:34.130
<v Speaker 1>treating other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

729
00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:41.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't think my wife loves are </v>
<v Speaker 1>internationally adopted daughter and she</v>

730
00:39:41.961 --> 00:39:42.794
<v Speaker 1>won't go to counseling with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My house is filled with tyranny and </v>

731
00:39:45.861 --> 00:39:47.450
<v Speaker 1>anger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any advice?</v>

732
00:39:47.451 --> 00:39:50.300
<v Speaker 1>Anonymous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

733
00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:03.213
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

734
00:40:05.290 --> 00:40:07.690
<v Speaker 1>That's a loaded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a set of loaded questions,</v>

735
00:40:07.691 --> 00:40:08.524
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think my wife loves are </v>

736
00:40:09.851 --> 00:40:13.540
<v Speaker 1>internationally adopted daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

737
00:40:13.541 --> 00:40:18.541
<v Speaker 1>the first question would be why not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But she in on the adoption,</v>

738
00:40:18.551 --> 00:40:20.560
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was it partly her decision?</v>

739
00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:25.580
<v Speaker 1>Here's a possibility.</v>

740
00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:32.530
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you could ask your under what </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions,</v>

741
00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:34.053
<v Speaker 1>ask her more specifically why she </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't like you're internationally </v>

742
00:40:38.051 --> 00:40:40.960
<v Speaker 1>adopted daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's too vague.</v>

743
00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:44.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't think my wife loves are </v>
<v Speaker 1>internationally adopted daughter.</v>

744
00:40:44.111 --> 00:40:44.944
<v Speaker 1>Break it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's something like there are 15 </v>

745
00:40:47.981 --> 00:40:52.330
<v Speaker 1>things about our life with our </v>
<v Speaker 1>internationally adopted daughter that my</v>

746
00:40:52.331 --> 00:40:53.890
<v Speaker 1>wife does not appreciate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

747
00:40:53.891 --> 00:40:56.740
<v Speaker 1>maybe some of those things are the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the daughter behaves.</v>

748
00:40:56.741 --> 00:40:59.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how old she is or anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>else about her and</v>

749
00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:04.300
<v Speaker 1>differentiate your problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's too vague.</v>

750
00:41:04.301 --> 00:41:07.630
<v Speaker 1>You'll never solve it this way because </v>
<v Speaker 1>loves isn't the right word.</v>

751
00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:08.913
<v Speaker 1>See if you can write down 30 reasons why</v>
<v Speaker 1>your wife is annoyed about your current </v>

752
00:41:12.101 --> 00:41:13.560
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

753
00:41:13.810 --> 00:41:17.080
<v Speaker 1>and maybe you'll have to differentiate </v>
<v Speaker 1>each of those 30 into 10 more,</v>

754
00:41:17.081 --> 00:41:18.850
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's 300 reasons.</v>

755
00:41:19.090 --> 00:41:19.923
<v Speaker 1>And then see if you can start asking her</v>
<v Speaker 1>about fixing some of the reasons that </v>

756
00:41:24.551 --> 00:41:27.340
<v Speaker 1>you differentiate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because obviously you can't go up to her</v>

757
00:41:27.341 --> 00:41:30.880
<v Speaker 1>and say you have to start loving are </v>
<v Speaker 1>internationally adopted daughter.</v>

758
00:41:30.881 --> 00:41:32.950
<v Speaker 1>That's just not going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you already know that.</v>

759
00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:34.543
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you break that down into the 20 </v>

760
00:41:37.491 --> 00:41:39.560
<v Speaker 1>reasons why she doesn't like your </v>
<v Speaker 1>daughter,</v>

761
00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:40.663
<v Speaker 1>then maybe you can figure out a way that</v>
<v Speaker 1>some progress might be made on one of </v>

762
00:41:44.811 --> 00:41:45.644
<v Speaker 1>those problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe if you take that approach for </v>

763
00:41:47.991 --> 00:41:51.740
<v Speaker 1>a whole year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then she'll go from like,</v>

764
00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:55.460
<v Speaker 1>she'll at least hit neutral or something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

765
00:41:56.020 --> 00:41:56.853
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

766
00:41:58.360 --> 00:41:59.193
<v Speaker 1>that's the best I can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Given that I only have three sentences </v>

767
00:42:02.741 --> 00:42:03.574
<v Speaker 1>to go on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So differentiate the problem and then </v>

768
00:42:05.981 --> 00:42:06.814
<v Speaker 1>solve the smaller problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have talked about the difference </v>

769
00:42:12.011 --> 00:42:15.370
<v Speaker 1>between intelligence and wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jason Clark,</v>

770
00:42:15.610 --> 00:42:18.580
<v Speaker 1>you have talked about the difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>between intelligence and wisdom.</v>

771
00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:19.570
<v Speaker 1>Saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>EH,</v>

772
00:42:20.410 --> 00:42:22.840
<v Speaker 1>intelligence isn't a shortcut to wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

773
00:42:22.841 --> 00:42:24.970
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's point something else out,</v>

774
00:42:24.971 --> 00:42:25.804
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stupidity isn't a shortcut to wisdom </v>

775
00:42:27.671 --> 00:42:30.340
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is your definition of wisdom?</v>

776
00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:44.693
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

777
00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.500
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the Old Testament view.</v>

778
00:42:46.501 --> 00:42:49.020
<v Speaker 1>That's the fear of God is the beginning </v>
<v Speaker 1>of wisdom.</v>

779
00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:50.333
<v Speaker 1>That's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think wisdom is in part the </v>

780
00:42:58.641 --> 00:42:59.474
<v Speaker 1>willingness to come to terms the </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge of your own capacity for </v>

781
00:43:03.021 --> 00:43:04.460
<v Speaker 1>malevolence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's wisdom.</v>

782
00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:05.593
<v Speaker 1>The the desire to rectify that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wish to set the world on a pathway </v>

783
00:43:12.471 --> 00:43:15.500
<v Speaker 1>that leads it closer to have and farther</v>
<v Speaker 1>away from hell.</v>

784
00:43:15.501 --> 00:43:16.334
<v Speaker 1>That's wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The humility to know that there's more </v>

785
00:43:27.551 --> 00:43:32.551
<v Speaker 1>things that you don't know then that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know and that you should be open to what</v>

786
00:43:32.561 --> 00:43:33.394
<v Speaker 1>you don't know when people inform you of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it because it's better to learn that it </v>

787
00:43:36.821 --> 00:43:41.821
<v Speaker 1>is to walk nose first into a wall or </v>
<v Speaker 1>blind folded off a cliff.</v>

788
00:43:46.970 --> 00:43:47.803
<v Speaker 1>The knowledge that you don't have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right to be a judge of being without </v>

789
00:43:52.191 --> 00:43:54.980
<v Speaker 1>having given it your utmost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's wisdom,</v>

790
00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:13.790
<v Speaker 1>wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What else?</v>

791
00:44:17.070 --> 00:44:17.903
<v Speaker 1>The knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wisdom is also the knowledge that hell </v>

792
00:44:19.591 --> 00:44:20.424
<v Speaker 1>is real enough so that you should do </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything you can to avoid either </v>

793
00:44:22.951 --> 00:44:26.770
<v Speaker 1>inhabiting it or producing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I learned from,</v>

794
00:44:26.771 --> 00:44:27.604
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from psychological analysis of the </v>

795
00:44:30.241 --> 00:44:33.780
<v Speaker 1>history of the 20th.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hell's real enough and,</v>

796
00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:37.350
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

797
00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:39.780
<v Speaker 1>you're duty bound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say your honor bound,</v>

798
00:44:39.781 --> 00:44:40.614
<v Speaker 1>you're ethically bound to do the </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposite of whatever produces those </v>

799
00:44:43.441 --> 00:44:44.790
<v Speaker 1>hellish circumstances.</v>

800
00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:48.453
<v Speaker 1>Amy Pellegrini says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is self sabotage such a future </v>

801
00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:52.900
<v Speaker 1>feature in human life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

802
00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:55.390
<v Speaker 1>I have a chapter about that in my new </v>
<v Speaker 1>book too.</v>

803
00:44:56.110 --> 00:44:58.390
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which chapter is it now?</v>

804
00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:01.453
<v Speaker 1>I think it's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't always match the content with </v>

805
00:45:04.071 --> 00:45:06.200
<v Speaker 1>the chapter title.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oddly enough.</v>

806
00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:16.450
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the chapter about picking </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends that are good for you.</v>

807
00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:17.861
<v Speaker 1>See?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes,</v>

808
00:45:17.861 --> 00:45:21.170
<v Speaker 1>I have it right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I didn't set that up by the way it,</v>

809
00:45:21.490 --> 00:45:24.400
<v Speaker 1>I genuinely did remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make friends with the people</v>

810
00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:27.890
<v Speaker 1>who wants the best for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was that it?</v>

811
00:45:27.891 --> 00:45:28.724
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Treat yourself like someone you were </v>

812
00:45:29.661 --> 00:45:31.880
<v Speaker 1>responsible for helping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There we go.</v>

813
00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:34.313
<v Speaker 2>MMM.</v>

814
00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:38.380
<v Speaker 1>Why are self sabotage such a feature?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

815
00:45:38.381 --> 00:45:39.960
<v Speaker 1>here's a couple of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first is,</v>

816
00:45:39.961 --> 00:45:44.080
<v Speaker 1>is that there's a lot of responsibility </v>
<v Speaker 1>with success,</v>

817
00:45:44.110 --> 00:45:46.720
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you,</v>

818
00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:51.230
<v Speaker 1>if you say yes to things and you do a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good job and,</v>

819
00:45:51.740 --> 00:45:53.900
<v Speaker 1>and you bear a large burden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have to carry it.</v>

820
00:45:53.901 --> 00:45:56.690
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of that might be success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

821
00:45:56.980 --> 00:46:00.470
<v Speaker 1>failure is a lot easier than success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus you can complain about it and whine</v>

822
00:46:00.471 --> 00:46:01.304
<v Speaker 1>about it and be a victim and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>garner all sorts of Kudos from yourself </v>

823
00:46:05.181 --> 00:46:07.370
<v Speaker 1>and others that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's that.</v>

824
00:46:08.270 --> 00:46:10.310
<v Speaker 1>It's just failure to adopt </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility.</v>

825
00:46:10.311 --> 00:46:12.620
<v Speaker 1>But then I would say too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's also revenge on,</v>

826
00:46:12.890 --> 00:46:13.723
<v Speaker 1>on the self and God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's partly why I liked the Cain and </v>

827
00:46:15.711 --> 00:46:16.544
<v Speaker 1>Abel story so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once I sort of figured out what it </v>

828
00:46:17.751 --> 00:46:18.890
<v Speaker 1>meant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

829
00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:25.710
<v Speaker 1>people have a hard time not having,</v>

830
00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:27.120
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

831
00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:30.660
<v Speaker 1>the kind of contempt that borders on </v>
<v Speaker 1>self hatred for the cells.</v>

832
00:46:30.661 --> 00:46:31.494
<v Speaker 1>Partly because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are fragile and mortal creatures and </v>

833
00:46:35.401 --> 00:46:36.234
<v Speaker 1>prone to error and malevolence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we know that of ourselves better </v>

834
00:46:39.031 --> 00:46:39.880
<v Speaker 1>than anyone else.</v>

835
00:46:41.330 --> 00:46:41.830
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

836
00:46:41.830 --> 00:46:42.663
<v Speaker 1>Because we know that we're prone to </v>
<v Speaker 1>punish ourselves and to think ill of </v>

837
00:46:45.551 --> 00:46:47.320
<v Speaker 1>ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

838
00:46:47.321 --> 00:46:48.154
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I learned from young </v>
<v Speaker 1>was that the injunction to do unto your </v>

839
00:46:51.881 --> 00:46:56.380
<v Speaker 1>neighbor as you would have him do unto </v>
<v Speaker 1>you was an equation rather than,</v>

840
00:46:56.570 --> 00:46:57.403
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a statement about how to be nice to </v>

841
00:46:59.051 --> 00:46:59.884
<v Speaker 1>people and that you have an ethical </v>
<v Speaker 1>obligation to treat yourself as if </v>

842
00:47:03.161 --> 00:47:06.730
<v Speaker 1>you're some a person of value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you don't really feel that,</v>

843
00:47:06.731 --> 00:47:11.731
<v Speaker 1>that you owe yourself the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you owe yourself the same treatment</v>

844
00:47:12.311 --> 00:47:14.920
<v Speaker 1>that you would give someone that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>cared for in love.</v>

845
00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:17.290
<v Speaker 1>Now it's a really hard thing to learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

846
00:47:17.291 --> 00:47:20.620
<v Speaker 1>cause you kind of have to detach </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself from your knowledge of all your</v>

847
00:47:20.830 --> 00:47:25.390
<v Speaker 1>insufficiencies and your flaws and treat</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself with dignity and respect.</v>

848
00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:26.433
<v Speaker 1>At least the dignity and respect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do someone who's faulty that could </v>

849
00:47:30.161 --> 00:47:30.994
<v Speaker 1>conceivably learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very difficult ethical </v>

850
00:47:33.551 --> 00:47:34.630
<v Speaker 1>lesson to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

851
00:47:34.631 --> 00:47:37.240
<v Speaker 1>it's easier to beat yourself continually</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the hip,</v>

852
00:47:37.241 --> 00:47:38.074
<v Speaker 1>back of the head with a club and to feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's justified given how much you know </v>

853
00:47:42.491 --> 00:47:45.220
<v Speaker 1>about how wretched and useless you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

854
00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:48.800
<v Speaker 1>so let's say there's two reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

855
00:47:49.330 --> 00:47:52.490
<v Speaker 1>one is that you don't want the </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility,</v>

856
00:47:52.491 --> 00:47:53.324
<v Speaker 1>so it's not really self sabotage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just avoidance of responsibility </v>

857
00:47:56.021 --> 00:47:58.420
<v Speaker 1>and consequence failure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the second is [inaudible].</v>

858
00:47:59.250 --> 00:47:59.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

859
00:47:59.810 --> 00:48:01.490
<v Speaker 1>punishment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>self punishment.</v>

860
00:48:01.491 --> 00:48:05.090
<v Speaker 1>That seems only just given what you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>about all your pathology and,</v>

861
00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:09.260
<v Speaker 1>and an error and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and insufficiencies.</v>

862
00:48:09.350 --> 00:48:13.140
<v Speaker 1>So I would say that that's the big two </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

863
00:48:16.550 --> 00:48:20.090
<v Speaker 1>Any advice for a grieving parent who </v>
<v Speaker 1>lost a child unexpectedly?</v>

864
00:48:21.110 --> 00:48:21.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

865
00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:22.573
<v Speaker 1>Well one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say make sure that you turn </v>

866
00:48:23.901 --> 00:48:26.000
<v Speaker 1>to the people that you have left at you </v>
<v Speaker 1>love.</v>

867
00:48:27.110 --> 00:48:30.800
<v Speaker 1>The second I would say is don't be </v>
<v Speaker 1>guilty about grieving.</v>

868
00:48:31.610 --> 00:48:32.443
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you have friends you could tell </v>

869
00:48:35.091 --> 00:48:38.330
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could let them do something nice for</v>

870
00:48:38.331 --> 00:48:39.164
<v Speaker 1>you because they would like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could figure out something they </v>

871
00:48:41.511 --> 00:48:42.344
<v Speaker 1>could do that would be nice that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>would appreciate and let them do it </v>

872
00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:45.793
<v Speaker 1>because you know other people are going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to grieve at some point in the future </v>

873
00:48:48.651 --> 00:48:50.930
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe they'll be able to ask you for</v>

874
00:48:50.931 --> 00:48:53.600
<v Speaker 1>help if you do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

875
00:48:58.560 --> 00:48:59.393
<v Speaker 1>well I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next thing I would say is give </v>

876
00:49:00.261 --> 00:49:01.460
<v Speaker 1>yourself time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

877
00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:02.473
<v Speaker 1>it takes a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe longer to adapt to adjust even </v>

878
00:49:06.590 --> 00:49:07.423
<v Speaker 1>reasonably to such a catastrophic loss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I would say try not to allow </v>

879
00:49:24.050 --> 00:49:29.050
<v Speaker 1>that terrible wound to make you bitter </v>
<v Speaker 1>because then not only will you have lost</v>

880
00:49:30.381 --> 00:49:31.214
<v Speaker 1>your child and grieve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you'll be bitter and then you'll be </v>

881
00:49:33.741 --> 00:49:37.160
<v Speaker 1>resentful and then you'll be hateful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that'll be like a terrible,</v>

882
00:49:37.970 --> 00:49:42.620
<v Speaker 1>that'll add insult to injury.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's too bad.</v>

883
00:49:46.380 --> 00:49:47.213
<v Speaker 1>Are there ever situations where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should hold your tongue and not speak </v>

884
00:49:49.501 --> 00:49:51.120
<v Speaker 1>what you believe?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

885
00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:55.050
<v Speaker 1>You most of the time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

886
00:49:55.380 --> 00:49:59.310
<v Speaker 1>it's really a tricky thing to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 1>when to say what you have to say.</v>

887
00:49:59.311 --> 00:50:01.560
<v Speaker 1>But I can give you a couple of rules of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thumb.</v>

888
00:50:02.010 --> 00:50:05.190
<v Speaker 1>It's a general question name and I can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>list all the situations,</v>

889
00:50:05.191 --> 00:50:07.140
<v Speaker 1>but I can give you some strategic </v>
<v Speaker 1>advice.</v>

890
00:50:07.410 --> 00:50:10.320
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone is,</v>

891
00:50:11.420 --> 00:50:15.480
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has said rude things to you,</v>

892
00:50:15.690 --> 00:50:17.990
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>says a rude thing to you,</v>

893
00:50:18.180 --> 00:50:19.013
<v Speaker 1>maybe you shouldn't respond immediately </v>
<v Speaker 1>even though you're very irritated </v>

894
00:50:21.241 --> 00:50:25.830
<v Speaker 1>because maybe that's just an impulsive </v>
<v Speaker 1>response and one that you'll regret when</v>

895
00:50:25.831 --> 00:50:26.664
<v Speaker 1>you make an anger that you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I would say when you're dealing </v>

896
00:50:29.691 --> 00:50:31.580
<v Speaker 1>with someone and you want to chastise </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

897
00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:34.820
<v Speaker 1>then you should wait for them to cin </v>
<v Speaker 1>three times,</v>

898
00:50:34.821 --> 00:50:36.920
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first time they're rude to you,</v>

899
00:50:36.921 --> 00:50:38.000
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

900
00:50:38.330 --> 00:50:41.780
<v Speaker 1>well they're probably having a bad day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or I misunderstood,</v>

901
00:50:41.781 --> 00:50:44.120
<v Speaker 1>or I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm rude sometimes too.</v>

902
00:50:44.121 --> 00:50:45.680
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just let it go.</v>

903
00:50:45.681 --> 00:50:48.200
<v Speaker 1>But you don't forget and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretend it didn't happen.</v>

904
00:50:48.201 --> 00:50:52.720
<v Speaker 1>And then it happens again and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

905
00:50:52.721 --> 00:50:55.000
<v Speaker 1>that could still be fluke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That could still be,</v>

906
00:50:56.980 --> 00:51:00.770
<v Speaker 1>that could still be situational.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe I'll just hold my damn tongue,</v>

907
00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:02.950
<v Speaker 1>but I'll remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll remember.</v>

908
00:51:02.951 --> 00:51:05.560
<v Speaker 1>And then the third time they do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you think,</v>

909
00:51:05.620 --> 00:51:06.190
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

910
00:51:06.190 --> 00:51:07.660
<v Speaker 1>three times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a pattern.</v>

911
00:51:07.661 --> 00:51:09.490
<v Speaker 1>And so then you can go to them and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can say,</v>

912
00:51:09.491 --> 00:51:12.190
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this happened.</v>

913
00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:13.690
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe they did die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you say,</v>

914
00:51:13.691 --> 00:51:15.250
<v Speaker 1>well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can deny it,</v>

915
00:51:15.251 --> 00:51:17.180
<v Speaker 1>but then this happened and maybe they </v>
<v Speaker 1>denied.</v>

916
00:51:17.181 --> 00:51:17.771
<v Speaker 1>And you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

917
00:51:17.771 --> 00:51:20.230
<v Speaker 1>you can deny that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then this happened</v>

918
00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:24.780
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three times the charm.</v>

919
00:51:25.590 --> 00:51:29.940
<v Speaker 1>And that's a time when you should stand </v>
<v Speaker 1>up for yourself and say what you have to</v>

920
00:51:29.941 --> 00:51:30.810
<v Speaker 1>say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

921
00:51:30.990 --> 00:51:34.470
<v Speaker 1>you have to put yourself in a position </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you can say what you have to say.</v>

922
00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:37.050
<v Speaker 1>You have to think it through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to have a plan.</v>

923
00:51:37.510 --> 00:51:38.343
<v Speaker 1>And you can't just launch yourself off </v>
<v Speaker 1>the edge of a cliff and hope that God's </v>

924
00:51:40.921 --> 00:51:43.790
<v Speaker 1>going to catch you on the way down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm saying,</v>

925
00:51:43.830 --> 00:51:44.663
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely the case that if you </v>

926
00:51:45.481 --> 00:51:47.790
<v Speaker 1>have something to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you're being oppressed at work,</v>

927
00:51:47.791 --> 00:51:49.500
<v Speaker 1>if you've got some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

928
00:51:49.710 --> 00:51:51.560
<v Speaker 1>horrible tyrant as a boss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

929
00:51:52.190 --> 00:51:54.120
<v Speaker 1>or maybe that's happening to you in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>marriage,</v>

930
00:51:54.121 --> 00:51:56.400
<v Speaker 1>or maybe you're the horrible tyrant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God only knows.</v>

931
00:51:56.730 --> 00:51:59.460
<v Speaker 1>There's things that have to be said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean you can just blurt</v>

932
00:51:59.461 --> 00:52:01.650
<v Speaker 1>them out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to have a plan.</v>

933
00:52:01.650 --> 00:52:03.420
<v Speaker 1>You have to figure out what you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say.</v>

934
00:52:03.450 --> 00:52:06.510
<v Speaker 1>You have to make it as minimally </v>
<v Speaker 1>troublesome as possible.</v>

935
00:52:06.511 --> 00:52:09.600
<v Speaker 1>You have to have the goal that you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>in mind,</v>

936
00:52:09.900 --> 00:52:12.090
<v Speaker 1>and you have to have a backup plan like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

937
00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:14.250
<v Speaker 1>the sort of thing that you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

938
00:52:14.251 --> 00:52:15.084
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you need to say something that's </v>

939
00:52:16.261 --> 00:52:19.200
<v Speaker 1>like a little war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to walk into that unarmed</v>

940
00:52:19.201 --> 00:52:20.034
<v Speaker 1>and unprepared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now that doesn't mean that you </v>

941
00:52:21.631 --> 00:52:22.464
<v Speaker 1>should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means that you should set up your </v>

942
00:52:24.211 --> 00:52:25.044
<v Speaker 1>life so that you're firmly enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>anchored in a variety of different ways </v>

943
00:52:28.771 --> 00:52:33.771
<v Speaker 1>so that you can say what you need to say</v>
<v Speaker 1>without dying as a consequence.</v>

944
00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:39.080
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

945
00:52:45.390 --> 00:52:46.770
<v Speaker 1>Josh Gates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh good.</v>

946
00:52:46.771 --> 00:52:47.604
<v Speaker 1>Josh asked me an easy question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Young suggested that the Christian Myth </v>

947
00:52:52.170 --> 00:52:53.003
<v Speaker 1>failed to articulate Christ descended </v>
<v Speaker 1>into hell and that this resulted in the </v>

948
00:52:56.911 --> 00:52:59.850
<v Speaker 1>mass shadow projection of the West.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thoughts?</v>

949
00:53:04.860 --> 00:53:06.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

950
00:53:07.020 --> 00:53:10.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to refer to my book again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talk about this and rule seven,</v>

951
00:53:10.561 --> 00:53:13.020
<v Speaker 1>pursue what is meaningful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not what is expedient.</v>

952
00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:14.213
<v Speaker 1>In that Chapter I discussed there's this</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea in Christianity that Christ took </v>

953
00:53:18.931 --> 00:53:19.764
<v Speaker 1>the sins of the world onto himself and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think that's very much related to the </v>

954
00:53:22.921 --> 00:53:24.660
<v Speaker 1>idea of descent into hell.</v>

955
00:53:27.190 --> 00:53:30.070
<v Speaker 1>They're not exactly the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

956
00:53:30.190 --> 00:53:34.240
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to address the first one </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it will shed light on the second.</v>

957
00:53:35.290 --> 00:53:35.730
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

958
00:53:35.730 --> 00:53:36.563
<v Speaker 1>so what does it mean that the Messiah is</v>
<v Speaker 1>archetype lead the figure who takes the </v>

959
00:53:40.171 --> 00:53:41.004
<v Speaker 1>sins of the world onto himself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What it means practically speaking or </v>

960
00:53:45.991 --> 00:53:46.824
<v Speaker 1>psychologically speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've tried this with some of my </v>

961
00:53:48.781 --> 00:53:49.614
<v Speaker 1>clients who were very naive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means to read the history of the </v>

962
00:53:53.431 --> 00:53:57.690
<v Speaker 1>world as if you were the perpetrator of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the evils that you read about instead of</v>

963
00:53:57.780 --> 00:54:00.630
<v Speaker 1>the victim or the noble intervener.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

964
00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:03.930
<v Speaker 1>I talked to somebody the other day about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the movie Schindler's list,</v>

965
00:54:03.931 --> 00:54:04.764
<v Speaker 1>and Schindler was this German </v>
<v Speaker 1>industrialist who saved a very large </v>

966
00:54:06.991 --> 00:54:10.260
<v Speaker 1>number of Jews that were in danger of </v>
<v Speaker 1>well in danger of,</v>

967
00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:11.153
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

968
00:54:11.550 --> 00:54:14.760
<v Speaker 1>of the final solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things he said was,</v>

969
00:54:14.761 --> 00:54:15.241
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

970
00:54:15.241 --> 00:54:16.074
<v Speaker 1>when people watch Schindler's list,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they always think they'd be schindler </v>

971
00:54:18.570 --> 00:54:20.610
<v Speaker 1>and on if they don't think they'd be </v>
<v Speaker 1>schindler,</v>

972
00:54:20.611 --> 00:54:23.280
<v Speaker 1>maybe they think they'd be the Jewish </v>
<v Speaker 1>victim of the Nazis,</v>

973
00:54:23.281 --> 00:54:26.370
<v Speaker 1>but they almost never think that they'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>be the Nazi persecutor.</v>

974
00:54:26.550 --> 00:54:30.180
<v Speaker 1>And that's a big mistake because when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you read about history,</v>

975
00:54:31.470 --> 00:54:36.470
<v Speaker 1>then you're reading about you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if the you is the perpetrator.</v>

976
00:54:37.050 --> 00:54:37.883
<v Speaker 1>And unless you understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then someone else has to be the </v>

977
00:54:40.021 --> 00:54:40.854
<v Speaker 1>perpetrator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if someone else had is the </v>

978
00:54:42.571 --> 00:54:43.404
<v Speaker 1>perpetrator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then you have a devil that you can </v>

979
00:54:44.551 --> 00:54:46.230
<v Speaker 1>chase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

980
00:54:46.231 --> 00:54:48.840
<v Speaker 1>maybe you've identified the devil </v>
<v Speaker 1>properly because you know,</v>

981
00:54:48.841 --> 00:54:53.160
<v Speaker 1>now and then it's like John Wayne gacy </v>
<v Speaker 1>or Ted Bundy or someone like that.</v>

982
00:54:53.161 --> 00:54:54.120
<v Speaker 1>And you've actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

983
00:54:54.121 --> 00:54:56.910
<v Speaker 1>you've identified a perpetrator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so often,</v>

984
00:54:58.750 --> 00:54:59.860
<v Speaker 1>far too often,</v>

985
00:55:01.010 --> 00:55:01.540
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

986
00:55:01.540 --> 00:55:02.373
<v Speaker 1>The best way to constrain the </v>
<v Speaker 1>malevolence outside is to constrain the </v>

987
00:55:04.661 --> 00:55:05.494
<v Speaker 1>malevolence within.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you don't have a locale for </v>

988
00:55:08.201 --> 00:55:09.034
<v Speaker 1>the evil of the world and you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>externalize it because the evil of the </v>

989
00:55:11.351 --> 00:55:16.270
<v Speaker 1>world certainly exists now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a better solution to</v>

990
00:55:17.060 --> 00:55:17.420
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

991
00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:18.253
<v Speaker 1>assume that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>fully capable of the terrible things </v>

992
00:55:24.401 --> 00:55:27.310
<v Speaker 1>that people have been capable of throat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the history of humanity,</v>

993
00:55:27.311 --> 00:55:31.720
<v Speaker 1>and to contend with that genuinely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's massive advantages to that.</v>

994
00:55:31.721 --> 00:55:32.441
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

995
00:55:32.441 --> 00:55:33.274
<v Speaker 1>it can actually produce and remarkable </v>
<v Speaker 1>increment and self esteem because you </v>

996
00:55:37.781 --> 00:55:38.614
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

997
00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:42.870
<v Speaker 1>if you're just a rabbit and you freeze </v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever a wolf looks at you,</v>

998
00:55:42.871 --> 00:55:45.180
<v Speaker 1>then you're just a frozen rabbit and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not so good.</v>

999
00:55:45.181 --> 00:55:46.014
<v Speaker 1>You're just a scared rabbit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But maybe you learn one day that you're </v>

1000
00:55:48.121 --> 00:55:48.954
<v Speaker 1>not a rabbit that you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're actually quite the damn monster </v>

1001
00:55:51.091 --> 00:55:51.924
<v Speaker 1>and you've got teeth and you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>really use them in an underhanded and </v>

1002
00:55:53.791 --> 00:55:56.540
<v Speaker 1>horrible way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why people like anti hero movies</v>

1003
00:55:56.541 --> 00:55:59.640
<v Speaker 1>so much hay because they go and see the </v>
<v Speaker 1>villains,</v>

1004
00:55:59.641 --> 00:56:00.474
<v Speaker 1>the mafia guys in these tough guys and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they antiheroes that populate our </v>

1005
00:56:03.661 --> 00:56:05.250
<v Speaker 1>imagination and think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

1006
00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:07.620
<v Speaker 1>well I'd really read it like to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone like that.</v>

1007
00:56:07.621 --> 00:56:10.590
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that being useless and weak,</v>

1008
00:56:11.010 --> 00:56:13.530
<v Speaker 1>it's better to be a monster then to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>useless and weak.</v>

1009
00:56:13.531 --> 00:56:14.364
<v Speaker 1>And that's because being useless and </v>
<v Speaker 1>week makes you a worst monster then a </v>

1010
00:56:16.711 --> 00:56:17.250
<v Speaker 1>monster.</v>

1011
00:56:17.250 --> 00:56:19.920
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's not like being a monster</v>
<v Speaker 1>is good,</v>

1012
00:56:19.921 --> 00:56:20.754
<v Speaker 1>but week use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this monster is the worst kind of </v>

1013
00:56:22.531 --> 00:56:24.290
<v Speaker 1>monster because that's the sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>monster,</v>

1014
00:56:24.310 --> 00:56:28.150
<v Speaker 1>little jumpy in the dark and sink its </v>
<v Speaker 1>teeth into the back of your neck instead</v>

1015
00:56:28.151 --> 00:56:30.340
<v Speaker 1>of confronting you forthrightly in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>alley.</v>

1016
00:56:30.730 --> 00:56:31.563
<v Speaker 1>And so if you start to see yourself as </v>
<v Speaker 1>the perpetrator of historical </v>

1017
00:56:34.571 --> 00:56:35.410
<v Speaker 1>malevolence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1018
00:56:35.411 --> 00:56:37.960
<v Speaker 1>if you can imagine yourself as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>Auschwitz camp guard,</v>

1019
00:56:37.961 --> 00:56:40.560
<v Speaker 1>if you see yourself as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the,</v>

1020
00:56:41.050 --> 00:56:41.883
<v Speaker 1>the vicious villain of the human story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then all of a sudden you've got a lot </v>

1021
00:56:44.471 --> 00:56:45.304
<v Speaker 1>more respect for yourself and you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>unlock that internal monster and that </v>

1022
00:56:48.041 --> 00:56:48.874
<v Speaker 1>internal monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe you can tame the damn </v>

1023
00:56:50.621 --> 00:56:51.454
<v Speaker 1>thing or at least bring it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring it into some sort of partnership </v>

1024
00:56:53.891 --> 00:56:56.020
<v Speaker 1>with yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when someone pushes you around,</v>

1025
00:56:56.170 --> 00:56:57.003
<v Speaker 1>you can let a little bit of that out in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your eyes just a little bit and you can </v>

1026
00:56:59.951 --> 00:57:00.784
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

1027
00:57:00.820 --> 00:57:02.020
<v Speaker 1>it would be better for you.</v>

1028
00:57:02.020 --> 00:57:04.060
<v Speaker 1>And for me if you didn't continue to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1029
00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:04.953
<v Speaker 1>And you can actually mean it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then actually it will start because </v>

1030
00:57:07.511 --> 00:57:10.600
<v Speaker 1>if you let a little bit of that out when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you tell someone to stop,</v>

1031
00:57:10.601 --> 00:57:13.090
<v Speaker 1>the probability that they'll stop is </v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely high.</v>

1032
00:57:13.450 --> 00:57:14.283
<v Speaker 1>And then just a tiny like vision of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>monster you could become is enough to </v>

1033
00:57:18.580 --> 00:57:20.200
<v Speaker 1>keep order in your house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1034
00:57:20.201 --> 00:57:25.030
<v Speaker 1>and maybe in your state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the mass shadow projection of the</v>

1035
00:57:25.031 --> 00:57:25.721
<v Speaker 1>West,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1036
00:57:25.721 --> 00:57:28.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's another thing.</v>

1037
00:57:28.270 --> 00:57:30.880
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things the Christians </v>
<v Speaker 1>figured out was that,</v>

1038
00:57:31.710 --> 00:57:35.020
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the snake in the garden of Eden was also</v>

1039
00:57:35.021 --> 00:57:36.370
<v Speaker 1>Satan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

1040
00:57:36.430 --> 00:57:38.710
<v Speaker 1>I can't get into that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's too complicated.</v>

1041
00:57:39.070 --> 00:57:43.120
<v Speaker 1>You'll have to read chapter seven if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want a full explication of that idea.</v>

1042
00:57:43.490 --> 00:57:45.640
<v Speaker 1>I that's as good an answer as to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>question does.</v>

1043
00:57:45.641 --> 00:57:48.340
<v Speaker 1>I can manage tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spent all day,</v>

1044
00:57:48.910 --> 00:57:49.743
<v Speaker 1>let's see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all day I got up at seven and I worked </v>

1045
00:57:51.581 --> 00:57:54.220
<v Speaker 1>all day till five on this video I told </v>
<v Speaker 1>you about.</v>

1046
00:57:54.221 --> 00:57:56.650
<v Speaker 1>So I made about 400 and it's or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

1047
00:57:56.651 --> 00:57:59.110
<v Speaker 1>So I'm a little bit on the burnt outside</v>
<v Speaker 1>tonight.</v>

1048
00:57:59.770 --> 00:58:03.910
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see.</v>

1049
00:58:03.911 --> 00:58:04.744
<v Speaker 1>Let's take a couple of questions from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the live chat and it's zooming along </v>

1050
00:58:07.481 --> 00:58:08.314
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1051
00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:09.873
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1052
00:58:11.410 --> 00:58:15.880
<v Speaker 1>how should one deal with recurring self </v>
<v Speaker 1>pity and why is it so gripping?</v>

1053
00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:17.733
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can be gripping for a variety of </v>

1054
00:58:19.571 --> 00:58:22.480
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be gripping because you are,</v>

1055
00:58:22.630 --> 00:58:25.680
<v Speaker 1>let's see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you are high in neuroticism.</v>

1056
00:58:25.700 --> 00:58:27.880
<v Speaker 1>That's a possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And A,</v>

1057
00:58:31.470 --> 00:58:32.700
<v Speaker 1>and why is it so gripping?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1058
00:58:32.701 --> 00:58:35.520
<v Speaker 1>that's another potential reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard for me to say.</v>

1059
00:58:35.850 --> 00:58:37.470
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see.</v>

1060
00:58:37.830 --> 00:58:40.500
<v Speaker 1>I have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another chapter like that.</v>

1061
00:58:40.501 --> 00:58:42.130
<v Speaker 1>What's it called there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1062
00:58:46.940 --> 00:58:47.451
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

1063
00:58:47.451 --> 00:58:50.540
<v Speaker 1>it's rule to treat yourself like someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were responsible for helping.</v>

1064
00:58:50.740 --> 00:58:52.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why the hell wouldn't you pity yourself?</v>

1065
00:58:52.431 --> 00:58:53.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are,</v>

1066
00:58:53.570 --> 00:58:55.760
<v Speaker 1>life is tragic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything ends in death.</v>

1067
00:58:55.761 --> 00:58:58.040
<v Speaker 1>Everything that you have will be taken </v>
<v Speaker 1>away from you.</v>

1068
00:58:58.200 --> 00:59:02.600
<v Speaker 1>You're weak and breakable and prone to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fits of impulsivity and malevolence.</v>

1069
00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:04.820
<v Speaker 1>How could you not have self pity?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1070
00:59:04.821 --> 00:59:06.080
<v Speaker 1>that's really the answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1071
00:59:06.380 --> 00:59:07.640
<v Speaker 1>but the next answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1072
00:59:07.641 --> 00:59:09.320
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite that it's not good enough.</v>

1073
00:59:09.830 --> 00:59:13.390
<v Speaker 1>You have to rise above all that even </v>
<v Speaker 1>though you have every reason for it.</v>

1074
00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:17.260
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing that's so paradoxical </v>
<v Speaker 1>is you have to rise above it even though</v>

1075
00:59:17.261 --> 00:59:18.094
<v Speaker 1>you have every reason for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of the reason you have to rise </v>

1076
00:59:20.171 --> 00:59:22.880
<v Speaker 1>above it is because if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes everything worse.</v>

1077
00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:25.910
<v Speaker 1>You and everything else and being </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

1078
00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:30.770
<v Speaker 1>And so it's gripping because well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does grip you,</v>

1079
00:59:30.860 --> 00:59:31.693
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>malevolence and tragedy and </v>

1080
00:59:33.711 --> 00:59:35.660
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability and mortality.</v>

1081
00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:37.700
<v Speaker 1>They're gripping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say,</v>

1082
00:59:37.701 --> 00:59:38.534
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to find something that's even </v>

1083
00:59:39.291 --> 00:59:41.780
<v Speaker 1>more gripping than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say the most,</v>

1084
00:59:41.960 --> 00:59:45.110
<v Speaker 1>the thing that's most gripping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only thing that's more gripping than</v>

1085
00:59:45.111 --> 00:59:48.410
<v Speaker 1>that in true and truth is to live a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

1086
00:59:49.220 --> 00:59:50.053
<v Speaker 1>to live the best life you possibly can </v>
<v Speaker 1>to live a life that's so noble that all </v>

1087
00:59:53.331 --> 00:59:57.740
<v Speaker 1>of those things are justifiable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uri l three 33 he says,</v>

1088
00:59:57.741 --> 01:00:00.770
<v Speaker 1>jp thinks he is a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>L U.</v>

1089
01:00:00.770 --> 01:00:01.603
<v Speaker 1>L I didn't know what l u l means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't actually think I'm a </v>

1090
01:00:04.461 --> 01:00:05.294
<v Speaker 1>monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a difference between thinking </v>

1091
01:00:06.801 --> 01:00:08.660
<v Speaker 1>you're a monster and knowing you're a </v>
<v Speaker 1>monster.</v>

1092
01:00:11.410 --> 01:00:12.750
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Foglight says,</v>

1093
01:00:12.751 --> 01:00:14.370
<v Speaker 1>I love this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well thank you.</v>

1094
01:00:14.371 --> 01:00:17.100
<v Speaker 1>Foglight I would probably love you too </v>
<v Speaker 1>if I knew you.</v>

1095
01:00:18.210 --> 01:00:23.210
<v Speaker 1>Let's see</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's that?</v>

1096
01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:30.730
<v Speaker 1>Santa's Christ says I'm a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roar.</v>

1097
01:00:30.790 --> 01:00:32.080
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a good start,</v>

1098
01:00:32.081 --> 01:00:33.700
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good start.</v>

1099
01:00:33.701 --> 01:00:36.070
<v Speaker 1>Practice that roar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1100
01:00:36.430 --> 01:00:38.950
<v Speaker 1>and get good at it because there'll be </v>
<v Speaker 1>times when you need it.</v>

1101
01:00:39.670 --> 01:00:40.503
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1102
01:00:45.010 --> 01:00:45.280
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1103
01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:48.460
<v Speaker 1>Dj chronic says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I let myself be that week monster for so</v>

1104
01:00:48.461 --> 01:00:48.971
<v Speaker 1>long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1105
01:00:48.971 --> 01:00:49.804
<v Speaker 1>well maybe you know what it's like man </v>
<v Speaker 1>down in your basement fantasizing about </v>

1106
01:00:53.231 --> 01:00:54.820
<v Speaker 1>revenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's no bloody fun.</v>

1107
01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:55.833
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is something now for an adler new </v>

1108
01:00:57.821 --> 01:00:58.654
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's worth reading those fantasies of </v>

1109
01:01:00.461 --> 01:01:01.181
<v Speaker 1>revenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1110
01:01:01.181 --> 01:01:03.820
<v Speaker 1>they have the seeds within them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You knew this as well.</v>

1111
01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.780
<v Speaker 1>The seeds within them of the new you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can let those,</v>

1112
01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:09.490
<v Speaker 1>you can let those fantasies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would you say?</v>

1113
01:01:09.491 --> 01:01:10.324
<v Speaker 1>Manifest themselves and see what seeds </v>
<v Speaker 1>of potential future development or </v>

1114
01:01:13.211 --> 01:01:16.360
<v Speaker 1>harbored within them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's also extremely useful.</v>

1115
01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:22.583
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1116
01:01:23.910 --> 01:01:26.250
<v Speaker 1>Ethan for Gal says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you boost your confidence?</v>

1117
01:01:26.251 --> 01:01:27.084
<v Speaker 1>Talking to people and get rid of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>paranoid that people hate you and don't </v>

1118
01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:32.490
<v Speaker 1>like you and think you're trash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how I feel.</v>

1119
01:01:32.670 --> 01:01:34.140
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the first thing is,</v>

1120
01:01:34.770 --> 01:01:35.603
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1121
01:01:41.190 --> 01:01:42.990
<v Speaker 1>let me tell you a little bit about </v>
<v Speaker 1>courage.</v>

1122
01:01:43.710 --> 01:01:45.120
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit about trust.</v>

1123
01:01:45.121 --> 01:01:48.060
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're a naive person,</v>

1124
01:01:48.660 --> 01:01:49.493
<v Speaker 1>you trust people because you think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are good and then maybe someone </v>

1125
01:01:53.251 --> 01:01:54.960
<v Speaker 1>comes along and hurts you and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

1126
01:01:54.961 --> 01:01:56.730
<v Speaker 1>people aren't good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't trust anyone.</v>

1127
01:01:56.731 --> 01:02:00.960
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe you're paranoid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think that people hate you and don't</v>

1128
01:02:00.961 --> 01:02:03.150
<v Speaker 1>like you and think you're trash and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>forth.</v>

1129
01:02:03.151 --> 01:02:05.220
<v Speaker 1>You don't trust people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you figure out,</v>

1130
01:02:05.221 --> 01:02:06.240
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this whole knock,</v>

1131
01:02:06.241 --> 01:02:09.580
<v Speaker 1>trusting people isn't working out very </v>
<v Speaker 1>well because now I can't get anywhere.</v>

1132
01:02:09.581 --> 01:02:10.414
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if I ever do meet someone who's </v>

1133
01:02:11.790 --> 01:02:12.623
<v Speaker 1>trustworthy and I don't trust them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they're not going to get an </v>

1134
01:02:14.461 --> 01:02:16.350
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to show me that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>trustworthy.</v>

1135
01:02:16.351 --> 01:02:17.184
<v Speaker 1>And so then what happens is that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>replace naive trust with courageous </v>

1136
01:02:21.181 --> 01:02:22.014
<v Speaker 1>trust and you put yourself out there </v>
<v Speaker 1>despite the fact that people might hate </v>

1137
01:02:24.631 --> 01:02:27.060
<v Speaker 1>you and don't like you and think you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>trash.</v>

1138
01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:29.010
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1139
01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:33.080
<v Speaker 1>the other thing I would say that's more </v>
<v Speaker 1>practical,</v>

1140
01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:34.153
<v Speaker 1>Ethan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you'd find that you only think </v>

1141
01:02:36.621 --> 01:02:37.454
<v Speaker 1>that when you run away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my suspicions are if you went out and </v>

1142
01:02:40.341 --> 01:02:41.174
<v Speaker 1>talked to people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you'd have to have something to </v>

1143
01:02:43.701 --> 01:02:44.690
<v Speaker 1>talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1144
01:02:44.900 --> 01:02:46.700
<v Speaker 1>but if you went out and talked to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

1145
01:02:47.330 --> 01:02:48.163
<v Speaker 1>you'd find that those thoughts only </v>
<v Speaker 1>bothered you for about 10 to 15 minutes </v>

1146
01:02:51.921 --> 01:02:53.870
<v Speaker 1>and then you would get over them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1147
01:02:53.871 --> 01:02:58.040
<v Speaker 1>a lot of that's a high neuroticism and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

1148
01:02:58.130 --> 01:03:01.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that in the big five aspect scale,</v>

1149
01:03:01.461 --> 01:03:02.294
<v Speaker 1>that's withdrawal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're experiencing a lot of withdrawal </v>

1150
01:03:04.731 --> 01:03:07.670
<v Speaker 1>related negative emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anticipatory anxiety.</v>

1151
01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:10.550
<v Speaker 1>And the best way to overcome that is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>not avoid.</v>

1152
01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:13.310
<v Speaker 1>So if you find yourself avoiding social </v>
<v Speaker 1>situations,</v>

1153
01:03:13.311 --> 01:03:16.010
<v Speaker 1>then you have to formulate a plan to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stop doing that.</v>

1154
01:03:16.310 --> 01:03:18.620
<v Speaker 1>And then over time your confidence will </v>
<v Speaker 1>be boosted.</v>

1155
01:03:22.390 --> 01:03:27.390
<v Speaker 1>Let's see here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy.</v>

1156
01:03:28.111 --> 01:03:29.550
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I watched those movies,</v>

1157
01:03:29.551 --> 01:03:31.740
<v Speaker 1>I always liked the bad guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew they were evil,</v>

1158
01:03:31.741 --> 01:03:33.360
<v Speaker 1>but they just seem cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1159
01:03:33.361 --> 01:03:34.194
<v Speaker 1>Well the thing is there's nothing cool </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's also nothing good about </v>

1160
01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:39.540
<v Speaker 1>naive harmlessness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1161
01:03:39.690 --> 01:03:41.630
<v Speaker 1>this is one of the things I really liked</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

1162
01:03:41.810 --> 01:03:43.540
<v Speaker 1>about learning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I learned from you.</v>

1163
01:03:43.650 --> 01:03:44.483
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1164
01:03:44.870 --> 01:03:45.510
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1165
01:03:45.510 --> 01:03:47.280
<v Speaker 1>naive harmlessness is</v>

1166
01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:48.690
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1167
01:03:48.690 --> 01:03:53.130
<v Speaker 1>It's worse than monstrosity because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem is if you're naive and harmless,</v>

1168
01:03:53.370 --> 01:03:54.203
<v Speaker 1>then someone else has to be the monster </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's not good because you are the </v>

1169
01:03:57.751 --> 01:03:59.220
<v Speaker 1>monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1170
01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:09.270
<v Speaker 1>so the bad guys are cool because they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>cooler than the people who think they're</v>

1171
01:04:09.271 --> 01:04:11.370
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but who are just cowardly and naive.</v>

1172
01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:12.713
<v Speaker 1>That's why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why people like bad guys in </v>

1173
01:04:14.071 --> 01:04:15.630
<v Speaker 1>movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1174
01:04:50.180 --> 01:04:51.013
<v Speaker 1>David Jackson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are your thoughts on Sophia's </v>

1175
01:04:52.461 --> 01:04:54.950
<v Speaker 1>citizenship status?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the robot.</v>

1176
01:04:54.951 --> 01:04:55.784
<v Speaker 1>I believe that the Saudi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Saudi Arabians made into a citizen </v>

1177
01:04:59.540 --> 01:05:00.860
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got a thought.</v>

1178
01:05:01.250 --> 01:05:04.580
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't it be nice if the Saudis </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually let their women be citizens?</v>

1179
01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:06.350
<v Speaker 1>That's what I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's my thoughts.</v>

1180
01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:07.513
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think that the rest of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world is in any position to take any </v>

1181
01:05:10.731 --> 01:05:11.564
<v Speaker 1>lessons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On what whatsoever on what constitutes </v>

1182
01:05:13.161 --> 01:05:16.460
<v Speaker 1>citizenship from the Saudis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my feeling about that.</v>

1183
01:05:16.790 --> 01:05:20.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a fan of Saudi Arabian culture.</v>

1184
01:05:20.171 --> 01:05:22.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a fan of the way that they treat</v>
<v Speaker 1>their women.</v>

1185
01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:23.193
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a fan of the way that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>disseminate Wahhabi propaganda into the </v>

1186
01:05:26.051 --> 01:05:28.300
<v Speaker 1>west.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a fan of the way that they,</v>

1187
01:05:28.630 --> 01:05:29.463
<v Speaker 1>they despise work and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not a fan of the Saudi Arabians </v>

1188
01:05:33.131 --> 01:05:33.964
<v Speaker 1>and the fact that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>granted Sophia citizenship status is a </v>

1189
01:05:37.871 --> 01:05:40.810
<v Speaker 1>publicity stunt of the worst form as far</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I'm concerned.</v>

1190
01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:42.333
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1191
01:05:44.180 --> 01:05:45.200
<v Speaker 1>hello,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr. Peterson.</v>

1192
01:05:45.201 --> 01:05:48.290
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever fear that your psychological</v>
<v Speaker 1>reading of the Bible is wrong?</v>

1193
01:05:48.410 --> 01:05:52.700
<v Speaker 1>While I'm sure it's wrong in some ways </v>
<v Speaker 1>even Satan can use scripture for his own</v>

1194
01:05:52.701 --> 01:05:53.534
<v Speaker 1>purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if you're just using the word for </v>

1195
01:05:55.131 --> 01:05:56.600
<v Speaker 1>your own gate?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1196
01:05:56.601 --> 01:05:59.750
<v Speaker 1>then God helped me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's,</v>

1197
01:05:59.751 --> 01:06:00.584
<v Speaker 1>that's what I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if I'm just using the word for my </v>

1198
01:06:03.081 --> 01:06:03.914
<v Speaker 1>own gain?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it would depend on what you </v>

1199
01:06:05.540 --> 01:06:08.360
<v Speaker 1>think of is gain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am using it for my own gain,</v>

1200
01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:13.250
<v Speaker 1>but I would say that I've aligned my own</v>
<v Speaker 1>game with the gain of others.</v>

1201
01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.520
<v Speaker 1>And that's made my own game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird thing,</v>

1202
01:06:16.521 --> 01:06:17.354
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if I'm see that way I can have </v>

1203
01:06:20.511 --> 01:06:23.900
<v Speaker 1>my cake and eat it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can do what I think is best for me,</v>

1204
01:06:23.901 --> 01:06:24.734
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time I can do what is </v>
<v Speaker 1>best for others and I've also defined </v>

1205
01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:32.480
<v Speaker 1>what is best for me as what is </v>
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously best for others.</v>

1206
01:06:32.690 --> 01:06:34.550
<v Speaker 1>And I believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I truly believe that.</v>

1207
01:06:34.580 --> 01:06:37.550
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm fully convinced of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I've thought it through.</v>

1208
01:06:37.940 --> 01:06:42.780
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's my answer to that.</v>

1209
01:07:02.810 --> 01:07:03.643
<v Speaker 1>Ellen Wilson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do I tell my half brother 14 and 17 </v>

1210
01:07:06.471 --> 01:07:08.180
<v Speaker 1>their father didn't leave three years </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

1211
01:07:08.181 --> 01:07:10.220
<v Speaker 1>but that we kicked him out because he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>a pedophile.</v>

1212
01:07:10.221 --> 01:07:13.370
<v Speaker 1>Who targeted my sister?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The older one is autistic.</v>

1213
01:07:13.790 --> 01:07:16.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm tired of lying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>

1214
01:07:16.941 --> 01:07:18.140
<v Speaker 1>Ellen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a rough one.</v>

1215
01:07:28.890 --> 01:07:31.290
<v Speaker 1>I can't tell you I can't help you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's too,</v>

1216
01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:36.330
<v Speaker 1>I'd need to know way more details.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can imagine you're tired of lying.</v>

1217
01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:41.600
<v Speaker 1>The 14 year old might be a little young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno ellen.</v>

1218
01:07:42.710 --> 01:07:44.240
<v Speaker 1>It's too complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

1219
01:07:44.270 --> 01:07:46.940
<v Speaker 1>I can't come up with a good ex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good answer for you.</v>

1220
01:07:46.941 --> 01:07:48.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1221
01:07:48.010 --> 01:07:51.590
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to know more details in order </v>
<v Speaker 1>not to botch the job.</v>

1222
01:07:57.740 --> 01:07:59.060
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see here.</v>

1223
01:08:00.830 --> 01:08:03.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm a British conservative millennial </v>
<v Speaker 1>training to be a school teacher.</v>

1224
01:08:03.771 --> 01:08:07.310
<v Speaker 1>How can I protect children age five to </v>
<v Speaker 1>11 from postmodernism,</v>

1225
01:08:07.490 --> 01:08:09.500
<v Speaker 1>which is everywhere in school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

1226
01:08:09.501 --> 01:08:11.300
<v Speaker 1>that's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's free at Hana.</v>

1227
01:08:11.540 --> 01:08:14.120
<v Speaker 1>That was the main video I was making </v>
<v Speaker 1>today was about that.</v>

1228
01:08:19.530 --> 01:08:22.350
<v Speaker 1>Teach them what you believe to be true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1229
01:08:22.470 --> 01:08:26.790
<v Speaker 1>Formulate for yourself a philosophy of </v>
<v Speaker 1>education or a serious one.</v>

1230
01:08:26.791 --> 01:08:27.690
<v Speaker 1>Write it down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1231
01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:29.490
<v Speaker 1>You can think about it as a mission </v>
<v Speaker 1>statement,</v>

1232
01:08:29.491 --> 01:08:31.200
<v Speaker 1>but write it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spend some time on it,</v>

1233
01:08:31.201 --> 01:08:32.034
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're devoting your whole life </v>

1234
01:08:33.031 --> 01:08:33.864
<v Speaker 1>to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Figuring out what kind of teacher you </v>

1235
01:08:34.921 --> 01:08:38.700
<v Speaker 1>want to be and come up with articulated </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons why you're going to be that sort</v>

1236
01:08:38.701 --> 01:08:41.340
<v Speaker 1>of teacher and then do it come hell or </v>
<v Speaker 1>high water.</v>

1237
01:08:41.790 --> 01:08:42.623
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like often there's kids out there that </v>

1238
01:08:44.461 --> 01:08:45.294
<v Speaker 1>only have to run into one good adult and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that will set them on the proper course </v>

1239
01:08:48.661 --> 01:08:50.940
<v Speaker 1>to the life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you could be that one good adult.</v>

1240
01:08:51.090 --> 01:08:54.630
<v Speaker 1>So I would say learn everything you </v>
<v Speaker 1>count about paws postmodernism.</v>

1241
01:08:54.631 --> 01:08:55.464
<v Speaker 1>So you're a master of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Decide what sort of teacher you want to </v>

1242
01:08:57.601 --> 01:08:59.970
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>implement that and and you'll,</v>

1243
01:09:00.060 --> 01:09:05.060
<v Speaker 1>you'll be a bulwark against that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophic foolishness and,</v>

1244
01:09:06.541 --> 01:09:08.220
<v Speaker 1>and help many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many people.</v>

1245
01:09:11.620 --> 01:09:14.770
<v Speaker 1>If the right to identify with certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>arguments has to be earned.</v>

1246
01:09:14.771 --> 01:09:18.340
<v Speaker 1>How does one earn it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do we truthfully discuss ideas</v>

1247
01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:24.500
<v Speaker 1>for which we have not earned it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's been wood.</v>

1248
01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:46.400
<v Speaker 1>If the right to identify with certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>arguments has to be earned,</v>

1249
01:09:46.401 --> 01:09:49.220
<v Speaker 1>how does one earn it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1250
01:09:49.221 --> 01:09:50.054
<v Speaker 1>I think you start by feeling out </v>
<v Speaker 1>physiologically what arguments you do </v>

1251
01:09:57.021 --> 01:09:57.854
<v Speaker 1>have the right to make and when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's that meditative consultation </v>

1252
01:10:03.291 --> 01:10:05.570
<v Speaker 1>practice that we talked about earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to</v>

1253
01:10:07.590 --> 01:10:08.423
<v Speaker 1>pay attention to your words and see if </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you utter them they put you in a </v>

1254
01:10:11.941 --> 01:10:12.774
<v Speaker 1>solid place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the line between chaos and order </v>

1255
01:10:14.821 --> 01:10:15.654
<v Speaker 1>as far as I'm concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can test continually that the </v>

1256
01:10:20.701 --> 01:10:23.730
<v Speaker 1>extensibility of your arguments by doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can,</v>

1257
01:10:24.210 --> 01:10:25.043
<v Speaker 1>you can implement more and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated arguments as you get </v>

1258
01:10:28.020 --> 01:10:28.853
<v Speaker 1>better and better at finding that place </v>
<v Speaker 1>to stand and take on larger and larger </v>

1259
01:10:32.101 --> 01:10:34.050
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's the other part of it is,</v>

1260
01:10:34.410 --> 01:10:37.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you earn the right to,</v>

1261
01:10:37.260 --> 01:10:38.430
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to an argument,</v>

1262
01:10:38.431 --> 01:10:41.130
<v Speaker 1>to a position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pick a small problem,</v>

1263
01:10:41.580 --> 01:10:42.413
<v Speaker 1>one that you think you could solve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's a little more than you can </v>

1264
01:10:45.091 --> 01:10:45.924
<v Speaker 1>chew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that bite off a little more </v>

1265
01:10:46.981 --> 01:10:50.670
<v Speaker 1>than you can chew but not too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then see if you can be successful at</v>

1266
01:10:50.671 --> 01:10:51.504
<v Speaker 1>solving it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that'll strengthen and put </v>

1267
01:10:52.741 --> 01:10:53.730
<v Speaker 1>things in order a little bit.</v>

1268
01:10:53.730 --> 01:10:54.563
<v Speaker 1>And then that will entitle you to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>use of certain arguments and those </v>

1269
01:10:58.261 --> 01:11:00.540
<v Speaker 1>arguments we related to what you've just</v>
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

1270
01:11:00.541 --> 01:11:03.540
<v Speaker 1>And then as soon as you've done that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll be a little stronger and more put</v>

1271
01:11:03.541 --> 01:11:07.380
<v Speaker 1>together and then you can take on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit bigger problem and fix that.</v>

1272
01:11:07.381 --> 01:11:10.260
<v Speaker 1>And then the same thing will happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you just keep doing that.</v>

1273
01:11:10.261 --> 01:11:12.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like progressive weightlifting and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1274
01:11:13.050 --> 01:11:13.883
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't truthfully discuss ideas that </v>

1275
01:11:15.541 --> 01:11:17.610
<v Speaker 1>you haven't yet earned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>

1276
01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:19.673
<v Speaker 1>you have to be quiet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to listen or you have to think </v>

1277
01:11:22.351 --> 01:11:23.910
<v Speaker 1>about something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to do something else.</v>

1278
01:11:23.911 --> 01:11:25.270
<v Speaker 1>There's lots to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1279
01:11:25.590 --> 01:11:26.423
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to engage in arguments </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you don't have any right to engage </v>

1280
01:11:28.921 --> 01:11:33.060
<v Speaker 1>in when there's all sorts of things you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can engage in right in front of you that</v>

1281
01:11:33.061 --> 01:11:33.894
<v Speaker 1>would fully engage you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be very useful in that you </v>

1282
01:11:35.671 --> 01:11:37.650
<v Speaker 1>could contribute to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1283
01:11:37.651 --> 01:11:39.960
<v Speaker 1>I really liked this idea of incremental </v>
<v Speaker 1>improvement.</v>

1284
01:11:39.961 --> 01:11:41.430
<v Speaker 1>It's soul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's such a good idea.</v>

1285
01:11:41.910 --> 01:11:42.743
<v Speaker 1>You look around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I have this room that I'm in right </v>

1286
01:11:44.581 --> 01:11:45.414
<v Speaker 1>now and it's kind of messy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I tell people to keep their room </v>

1287
01:11:48.271 --> 01:11:52.020
<v Speaker 1>clean and I'd been trying to clean up </v>
<v Speaker 1>this room since like last January,</v>

1288
01:11:52.350 --> 01:11:56.070
<v Speaker 1>but I guess because so much chaos has </v>
<v Speaker 1>been generated</v>

1289
01:11:57.540 --> 01:12:00.960
<v Speaker 1>around me in some sense that some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's flooded into this room.</v>

1290
01:12:00.961 --> 01:12:02.640
<v Speaker 1>The rest of the house is in really good </v>
<v Speaker 1>order,</v>

1291
01:12:02.641 --> 01:12:04.980
<v Speaker 1>but the residual chaos is still in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>room.</v>

1292
01:12:05.310 --> 01:12:06.600
<v Speaker 1>But when I come in here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1293
01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:07.793
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try to spend five minutes to clean up </v>

1294
01:12:11.551 --> 01:12:13.340
<v Speaker 1>a bit of correspondence or something and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1295
01:12:13.370 --> 01:12:16.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm definitely making progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The room is in much better shape than it</v>

1296
01:12:16.171 --> 01:12:17.450
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1297
01:12:19.610 --> 01:12:20.443
<v Speaker 1>don't underestimate the utility of </v>
<v Speaker 1>incremental improvement and you </v>

1298
01:12:23.211 --> 01:12:24.044
<v Speaker 1>strengthen yourself by doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you can talk about the things </v>

1299
01:12:26.091 --> 01:12:28.040
<v Speaker 1>that you've actually done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1300
01:12:28.041 --> 01:12:28.874
<v Speaker 1>in detail in the kind of detail that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would convince someone who is skeptical </v>

1301
01:12:31.851 --> 01:12:34.520
<v Speaker 1>and knowledgeable that you are someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>who knew what they were talking about.</v>

1302
01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.190
<v Speaker 1>And then if you do that over 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you'll,</v>

1303
01:12:37.490 --> 01:12:38.570
<v Speaker 1>you'll be solid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your,</v>

1304
01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:40.000
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1305
01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:40.833
<v Speaker 1>the breadth of argumentation that you'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>have at your fingertips will vastly </v>

1306
01:12:43.251 --> 01:12:44.084
<v Speaker 1>improve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a female student in stem and I feel </v>

1307
01:12:51.181 --> 01:12:54.600
<v Speaker 1>bombarded by all the feminist groups </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to infantilize me.</v>

1308
01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:57.720
<v Speaker 1>How do I prevent them from turning me </v>
<v Speaker 1>into an adult child?</v>

1309
01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:01.393
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that's really useful </v>

1310
01:13:03.261 --> 01:13:05.840
<v Speaker 1>to do in university is to pick your peer</v>
<v Speaker 1>group.</v>

1311
01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:07.880
<v Speaker 1>When I went to university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I,</v>

1312
01:13:07.881 --> 01:13:11.030
<v Speaker 1>I made new friends in university and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was really useful.</v>

1313
01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:11.953
<v Speaker 1>So I had my personal friends and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were people who were trying to aim at </v>

1314
01:13:15.321 --> 01:13:16.154
<v Speaker 1>something better than what they had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something better than what they had </v>

1315
01:13:19.701 --> 01:13:21.770
<v Speaker 1>left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was a real relief to me.</v>

1316
01:13:21.950 --> 01:13:24.980
<v Speaker 1>I wrote about that in my new book too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1317
01:13:25.340 --> 01:13:28.880
<v Speaker 1>called make friends with people who want</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best for you.</v>

1318
01:13:28.881 --> 01:13:30.920
<v Speaker 1>That's rule three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1319
01:13:31.820 --> 01:13:33.770
<v Speaker 1>but I also realized that when you went </v>
<v Speaker 1>to university,</v>

1320
01:13:33.771 --> 01:13:34.604
<v Speaker 1>you picked your peers and in the stem </v>
<v Speaker 1>fields is what you should do is pick </v>

1321
01:13:37.881 --> 01:13:41.360
<v Speaker 1>some great scientists and those could be</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that you just read books about.</v>

1322
01:13:41.510 --> 01:13:45.410
<v Speaker 1>Pick some great scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man or some great engineers.</v>

1323
01:13:45.411 --> 01:13:46.244
<v Speaker 1>There's some great mathematicians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I don't know where you are in the </v>

1324
01:13:47.991 --> 01:13:48.824
<v Speaker 1>stem fields.</v>

1325
01:13:48.890 --> 01:13:49.723
<v Speaker 1>Pick some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pick a hero or two or three and then </v>

1326
01:13:52.731 --> 01:13:53.564
<v Speaker 1>make those of your peers right and don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>pay any attention to all the noise and </v>

1327
01:13:56.301 --> 01:13:59.000
<v Speaker 1>Ruckus that you hear around you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all nonsense anyways.</v>

1328
01:13:59.270 --> 01:14:00.103
<v Speaker 1>Partly what should happen when you go to</v>
<v Speaker 1>university is that you should be </v>

1329
01:14:02.061 --> 01:14:06.320
<v Speaker 1>introduced to great people and those can</v>
<v Speaker 1>be great people of the past.</v>

1330
01:14:06.321 --> 01:14:07.154
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their spirits still live on in their </v>

1331
01:14:08.211 --> 01:14:09.044
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in their books and you can pick them as </v>

1332
01:14:10.431 --> 01:14:14.200
<v Speaker 1>peers and ignore all that idiot </v>
<v Speaker 1>political nonsense.</v>

1333
01:14:14.201 --> 01:14:18.190
<v Speaker 1>Well you straighten yourself out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn to be great at what you do.</v>

1334
01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:19.833
<v Speaker 1>Develop a philosophy of greatness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that will keep the social justice </v>

1335
01:14:23.201 --> 01:14:24.034
<v Speaker 1>warriors at bay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What books are we read to our young </v>

1336
01:14:28.851 --> 01:14:30.350
<v Speaker 1>children?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1337
01:14:30.351 --> 01:14:33.050
<v Speaker 1>it depends on how young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really young.</v>

1338
01:14:33.051 --> 01:14:33.884
<v Speaker 1>There's this book called how to teach </v>
<v Speaker 1>your child to read in a hundred easy </v>

1339
01:14:36.381 --> 01:14:37.700
<v Speaker 1>lessons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all type that.</v>

1340
01:14:38.690 --> 01:14:43.690
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1341
01:14:46.721 --> 01:14:51.721
<v Speaker 1>I've done something technical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called how to teach.</v>

1342
01:15:00.410 --> 01:15:05.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean something technically poor your </v>
<v Speaker 1>child to read in 100 easy lessons.</v>

1343
01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:13.000
<v Speaker 1>That is an excellent book because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can actually teach your child to read it</v>

1344
01:15:13.001 --> 01:15:14.750
<v Speaker 1>in a hundred easy lessons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very smart,</v>

1345
01:15:14.780 --> 01:15:15.920
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very smart book.</v>

1346
01:15:15.921 --> 01:15:18.770
<v Speaker 1>Very well developed psychologically </v>
<v Speaker 1>older kids.</v>

1347
01:15:18.890 --> 01:15:19.723
<v Speaker 1>I really liked the Harry Potter books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that rolling nailed the </v>

1348
01:15:22.491 --> 01:15:24.590
<v Speaker 1>mythological structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1349
01:15:25.610 --> 01:15:26.443
<v Speaker 1>what else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm in collaboration with my </v>

1350
01:15:28.311 --> 01:15:29.144
<v Speaker 1>daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm putting together a reading list for </v>

1351
01:15:30.531 --> 01:15:32.780
<v Speaker 1>young people for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for kids and young adults.</v>

1352
01:15:32.781 --> 01:15:35.180
<v Speaker 1>So I guess I'll have to answer it that </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

1353
01:15:36.780 --> 01:15:37.613
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

1354
01:15:41.030 --> 01:15:43.610
<v Speaker 1>I can't bring it to mind and I can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>bring it to mind.</v>

1355
01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:50.193
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1356
01:15:50.670 --> 01:15:51.503
<v Speaker 1>Daniel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to be a good partner to someone </v>

1357
01:15:52.861 --> 01:15:55.560
<v Speaker 1>suffering from depression?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a tough one,</v>

1358
01:15:55.561 --> 01:15:56.394
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very hard to live with someone </v>

1359
01:15:57.751 --> 01:15:58.584
<v Speaker 1>who's suffering from depression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We helping without enabling and pushing </v>

1360
01:16:01.321 --> 01:16:04.140
<v Speaker 1>without being too judgmental?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1361
01:16:04.380 --> 01:16:06.000
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the devil's in the details.</v>

1362
01:16:06.030 --> 01:16:09.210
<v Speaker 1>Is the person seeing a counselor because</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're depressed,</v>

1363
01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:13.560
<v Speaker 1>then they need to talk to someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have they tried antidepressants?</v>

1364
01:16:13.561 --> 01:16:16.470
<v Speaker 1>Because if they're depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they should try antidepressants</v>

1365
01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:22.730
<v Speaker 1>and they should be strongly encouraged </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do so.</v>

1366
01:16:22.731 --> 01:16:26.780
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that encouragement should even</v>
<v Speaker 1>border on a demand because depression is</v>

1367
01:16:26.781 --> 01:16:27.770
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's terrible.</v>

1368
01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:29.840
<v Speaker 1>It's terrible for the person who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiencing it,</v>

1369
01:16:29.841 --> 01:16:32.190
<v Speaker 1>like unalterably terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1370
01:16:36.020 --> 01:16:36.853
<v Speaker 1>and it's terrible for the person who is </v>
<v Speaker 1>living with the person who has </v>

1371
01:16:39.171 --> 01:16:40.004
<v Speaker 1>depression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's incumbent on the person who </v>

1372
01:16:41.991 --> 01:16:42.824
<v Speaker 1>has depression to do everything they </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly can in order to set it </v>

1373
01:16:47.341 --> 01:16:48.470
<v Speaker 1>straight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's hard.</v>

1374
01:16:48.471 --> 01:16:50.960
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of potential treatments for</v>

1375
01:16:50.961 --> 01:16:53.390
<v Speaker 1>depression that have some efficacy in </v>
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants.</v>

1376
01:16:53.391 --> 01:16:54.224
<v Speaker 1>Really do work wonders on people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could try five hydroxy tryptamine </v>

1377
01:16:57.291 --> 01:16:58.220
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could look that up.</v>

1378
01:16:58.221 --> 01:16:59.054
<v Speaker 1>Five htp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's usually three times a hundred </v>

1379
01:17:01.371 --> 01:17:02.770
<v Speaker 1>milligrams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1380
01:17:03.210 --> 01:17:04.460
<v Speaker 1>and you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you try that,</v>

1381
01:17:04.461 --> 01:17:05.294
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you can find out if </v>
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants will work for you </v>

1382
01:17:07.161 --> 01:17:09.320
<v Speaker 1>without having to resort to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants.</v>

1383
01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:11.353
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can also help the depressed person </v>

1384
01:17:13.221 --> 01:17:14.054
<v Speaker 1>make a plan in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That can be really useful or maybe a </v>

1385
01:17:16.491 --> 01:17:17.324
<v Speaker 1>plan the night before if they're just </v>
<v Speaker 1>not in any shape to do it in the </v>

1386
01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:20.570
<v Speaker 1>morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to sit down and say,</v>

1387
01:17:20.571 --> 01:17:23.060
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you have to get through tomorrow.</v>

1388
01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:27.380
<v Speaker 1>And that's another good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's another good piece of advice.</v>

1389
01:17:27.381 --> 01:17:28.214
<v Speaker 1>And so in rule 12,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talk about that sometimes in </v>

1390
01:17:32.421 --> 01:17:33.254
<v Speaker 1>relationship to depression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real 12 is pet a cat when you encounter </v>

1391
01:17:35.631 --> 01:17:36.464
<v Speaker 1>one on the street and it's a bit of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>meditation about what to do when your </v>

1392
01:17:38.541 --> 01:17:40.640
<v Speaker 1>life is in absolute crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1393
01:17:41.230 --> 01:17:42.063
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you can do with </v>

1394
01:17:43.131 --> 01:17:43.964
<v Speaker 1>someone who's depressed is narrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is what I discuss in this </v>

1395
01:17:46.041 --> 01:17:49.160
<v Speaker 1>chapter is narrowed their timeframe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1396
01:17:49.161 --> 01:17:51.800
<v Speaker 1>maybe a depressed person can't think a </v>
<v Speaker 1>week ahead,</v>

1397
01:17:51.801 --> 01:17:54.860
<v Speaker 1>but maybe they can think about tomorrow </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can sit down and say,</v>

1398
01:17:54.861 --> 01:17:56.480
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you have to get through tomorrow.</v>

1399
01:17:56.750 --> 01:17:58.370
<v Speaker 1>And so how are we going to structure </v>
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow?</v>

1400
01:17:58.371 --> 01:17:59.204
<v Speaker 1>So that will be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that you'll be able to sleep </v>

1401
01:18:00.711 --> 01:18:02.960
<v Speaker 1>reasonably soundly when you go to bed </v>
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow night.</v>

1402
01:18:02.961 --> 01:18:03.794
<v Speaker 1>And then tomorrow night we'll do the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing and helping someone come up </v>

1403
01:18:06.801 --> 01:18:07.634
<v Speaker 1>with a daily plan can be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now they might object and squawk and </v>

1404
01:18:10.401 --> 01:18:12.290
<v Speaker 1>complain about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you should be.</v>

1405
01:18:12.550 --> 01:18:13.383
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say relatively persistent about </v>

1406
01:18:14.961 --> 01:18:15.950
<v Speaker 1>that and you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1407
01:18:15.951 --> 01:18:18.590
<v Speaker 1>let's just try it for a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if they say no,</v>

1408
01:18:18.591 --> 01:18:20.870
<v Speaker 1>then you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well let's try it for one day.</v>

1409
01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:22.160
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ,</v>

1410
01:18:22.310 --> 01:18:23.143
<v Speaker 1>the person's got to be pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>unreasonable if they let's plan for 10 </v>

1411
01:18:25.761 --> 01:18:28.130
<v Speaker 1>minutes just for tomorrow and see if </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's helpful.</v>

1412
01:18:28.150 --> 01:18:29.810
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the person objects,</v>

1413
01:18:29.811 --> 01:18:30.644
<v Speaker 1>you can keep cutting the magnitude of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're asking down until you </v>

1414
01:18:33.411 --> 01:18:36.380
<v Speaker 1>finally get a bit of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bit of an agreement from them.</v>

1415
01:18:36.381 --> 01:18:38.930
<v Speaker 1>But helping someone depressed plan can </v>
<v Speaker 1>help a lot</v>

1416
01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:53.553
<v Speaker 1>you up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You said you don't go to church because </v>

1417
01:18:57.841 --> 01:18:58.674
<v Speaker 1>the pastors are lying most of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean by lying in this </v>

1418
01:19:01.441 --> 01:19:02.274
<v Speaker 1>instance?</v>

1419
01:19:03.830 --> 01:19:04.663
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my experience has been that they don't </v>

1420
01:19:06.291 --> 01:19:08.570
<v Speaker 1>believe what they're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it sounds like to me.</v>

1421
01:19:09.260 --> 01:19:10.093
<v Speaker 1>That's what I mean by lying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say these things and they tell </v>

1422
01:19:12.111 --> 01:19:12.944
<v Speaker 1>people to believe them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they don't believe them themselves </v>

1423
01:19:14.870 --> 01:19:15.703
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're actually not listening to </v>

1424
01:19:16.971 --> 01:19:17.804
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not listening to what they're </v>

1425
01:19:18.831 --> 01:19:19.664
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing that I've always had </v>

1426
01:19:20.511 --> 01:19:21.344
<v Speaker 1>this experience in church and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of other reasons I don't go to </v>

1427
01:19:23.031 --> 01:19:25.070
<v Speaker 1>church and a lot of them have to do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

1428
01:19:25.370 --> 01:19:28.910
<v Speaker 1>not with the insufficiency of church,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1429
01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:30.193
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the scriptural writing's really</v>
<v Speaker 1>have really hit me and I do understand </v>

1430
01:19:33.291 --> 01:19:35.640
<v Speaker 1>some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think to some degree and it's,</v>

1431
01:19:35.770 --> 01:19:40.610
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of painful to hear them </v>
<v Speaker 1>utilized by people who are doing it.</v>

1432
01:19:41.060 --> 01:19:42.560
<v Speaker 1>Formulaically or</v>

1433
01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:43.940
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1434
01:19:43.940 --> 01:19:44.773
<v Speaker 1>Without conviction or even worse knowing</v>
<v Speaker 1>full well that they don't believe what </v>

1435
01:19:49.191 --> 01:19:51.920
<v Speaker 1>they're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what I mean by lying.</v>

1436
01:19:54.590 --> 01:19:57.950
<v Speaker 1>My first ever girlfriend of three months</v>
<v Speaker 1>is pregnant and keeping the baby.</v>

1437
01:19:58.400 --> 01:20:01.760
<v Speaker 1>She said I can walk away or marry her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No in between.</v>

1438
01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:05.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't love her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do I do?</v>

1439
01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:16.353
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess you have to figure out what you </v>

1440
01:20:17.561 --> 01:20:18.394
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe you could sit down and write </v>

1441
01:20:21.911 --> 01:20:26.911
<v Speaker 1>out what you would like in terms of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with this child.</v>

1442
01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:28.353
<v Speaker 1>You know you've got a child coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really something that's someone </v>

1443
01:20:30.641 --> 01:20:32.680
<v Speaker 1>that could actually like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1444
01:20:32.681 --> 01:20:37.060
<v Speaker 1>maybe you could write down and you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>sit down and write out and offer,</v>

1445
01:20:37.180 --> 01:20:38.013
<v Speaker 1>here's what I could offer to this child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's what I would like to offer to </v>

1446
01:20:40.991 --> 01:20:43.900
<v Speaker 1>this child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about it because you know,</v>

1447
01:20:43.901 --> 01:20:45.880
<v Speaker 1>maybe you want to have a relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>with this person.</v>

1448
01:20:45.890 --> 01:20:46.723
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that person might be around when you're </v>

1449
01:20:47.501 --> 01:20:48.334
<v Speaker 1>like 70 so there's somebody you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a relationship with the rest for </v>

1450
01:20:51.191 --> 01:20:52.024
<v Speaker 1>the rest of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you want that person to think </v>

1451
01:20:53.141 --> 01:20:53.861
<v Speaker 1>about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1452
01:20:53.861 --> 01:20:56.380
<v Speaker 1>you don't love her mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's a real complication.</v>

1453
01:20:56.381 --> 01:20:57.670
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

1454
01:20:58.120 --> 01:20:59.830
<v Speaker 1>well that's a real complication.</v>

1455
01:20:59.830 --> 01:21:03.580
<v Speaker 1>So you're in quite the fix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you could decide what you're willing</v>

1456
01:21:03.581 --> 01:21:05.770
<v Speaker 1>to offer and then you could and do it in</v>
<v Speaker 1>detail,</v>

1457
01:21:05.771 --> 01:21:06.640
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not just,</v>

1458
01:21:06.730 --> 01:21:07.750
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to help.</v>

1459
01:21:07.751 --> 01:21:08.720
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

1460
01:21:08.740 --> 01:21:11.980
<v Speaker 1>that's not helpful either way past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to help,</v>

1461
01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:13.233
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the amount of money I'd like to </v>

1462
01:21:14.441 --> 01:21:17.230
<v Speaker 1>contribute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's an amount of time I would like to</v>

1463
01:21:17.231 --> 01:21:18.064
<v Speaker 1>spend with the child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's an amount of time I would spend </v>

1464
01:21:19.961 --> 01:21:22.660
<v Speaker 1>babysitting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like make differentiated,</v>

1465
01:21:22.661 --> 01:21:23.950
<v Speaker 1>make a real plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1466
01:21:23.980 --> 01:21:24.813
<v Speaker 1>like you're someone with a clue and </v>
<v Speaker 1>offer that to your girlfriend and see </v>

1467
01:21:28.001 --> 01:21:30.010
<v Speaker 1>what she says and give her some time to </v>
<v Speaker 1>think about it,</v>

1468
01:21:30.011 --> 01:21:30.844
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because maybe this could be a blessing </v>

1469
01:21:32.711 --> 01:21:33.544
<v Speaker 1>instead of a curse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she said I can walk away or marry </v>

1470
01:21:37.361 --> 01:21:38.440
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No inbetween.</v>

1471
01:21:38.950 --> 01:21:40.030
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what she says,</v>

1472
01:21:40.031 --> 01:21:42.520
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe if you made her a concrete offer,</v>

1473
01:21:42.521 --> 01:21:43.930
<v Speaker 1>she'd be willing to reconsider.</v>

1474
01:21:45.610 --> 01:21:49.330
<v Speaker 1>Often like a new mother can really use </v>
<v Speaker 1>help with the baby could really use help</v>

1475
01:21:49.331 --> 01:21:51.550
<v Speaker 1>with the baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even just being a babysitter,</v>

1476
01:21:51.551 --> 01:21:52.384
<v Speaker 1>if you were like committed to it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>made the real offer like you'd thought </v>

1477
01:21:55.751 --> 01:21:56.501
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about,</v>

1478
01:21:56.501 --> 01:21:58.960
<v Speaker 1>think about it for a whole week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1479
01:21:58.961 --> 01:22:00.430
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here comes this baby.</v>

1480
01:22:00.550 --> 01:22:02.860
<v Speaker 1>If I was being a civilized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>useful person,</v>

1481
01:22:02.980 --> 01:22:05.050
<v Speaker 1>but I don't love the mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1482
01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:07.660
<v Speaker 1>then what should I do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1483
01:22:07.661 --> 01:22:08.494
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to ask yourself a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of questions and maybe talk to some </v>

1484
01:22:10.481 --> 01:22:11.650
<v Speaker 1>people that you trust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1485
01:22:12.020 --> 01:22:12.853
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a problem we're solving because it </v>

1486
01:22:14.231 --> 01:22:15.310
<v Speaker 1>might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1487
01:22:15.311 --> 01:22:17.460
<v Speaker 1>it's a relationship you could have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rest of your life and,</v>

1488
01:22:17.590 --> 01:22:20.320
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't have it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be a hole in your life.</v>

1489
01:22:20.321 --> 01:22:23.170
<v Speaker 1>You're always gonna wonder what the Hell</v>
<v Speaker 1>is going on with that person.</v>

1490
01:22:23.620 --> 01:22:24.453
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1491
01:22:32.650 --> 01:22:33.483
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1492
01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:38.160
<v Speaker 1>we are expecting our first eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Evan says,</v>

1493
01:22:38.161 --> 01:22:41.130
<v Speaker 1>we are expecting our first child in me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a daughter,</v>

1494
01:22:41.650 --> 01:22:42.483
<v Speaker 1>and he's specific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any advice specific to raising </v>

1495
01:22:44.491 --> 01:22:45.870
<v Speaker 1>daughters?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1496
01:22:45.871 --> 01:22:48.150
<v Speaker 1>congratulations first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's great.</v>

1497
01:22:48.500 --> 01:22:49.333
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1498
01:22:56.420 --> 01:22:57.253
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1499
01:22:57.430 --> 01:22:58.263
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just thinking about my daughter and </v>

1500
01:22:59.261 --> 01:23:00.400
<v Speaker 1>specific advice.</v>

1501
01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:10.840
<v Speaker 1>I would say don't be afraid to support </v>
<v Speaker 1>her masculine and feminine sides,</v>

1502
01:23:11.620 --> 01:23:12.453
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the feminine side is you'll find </v>

1503
01:23:13.841 --> 01:23:14.890
<v Speaker 1>little girls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1504
01:23:14.891 --> 01:23:17.260
<v Speaker 1>not all little girls because some are </v>
<v Speaker 1>more masculine than others.</v>

1505
01:23:17.261 --> 01:23:19.150
<v Speaker 1>But let's say you have a more feminine </v>
<v Speaker 1>little girl.</v>

1506
01:23:19.300 --> 01:23:20.133
<v Speaker 1>She's going to like to dress up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she's going to like to put on </v>

1507
01:23:21.581 --> 01:23:22.414
<v Speaker 1>jewelry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing how much of that stuff </v>

1508
01:23:23.741 --> 01:23:26.530
<v Speaker 1>seems to be implicit or a neat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1509
01:23:26.531 --> 01:23:29.560
<v Speaker 1>and that can be really supported.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then by the same token,</v>

1510
01:23:29.561 --> 01:23:30.394
<v Speaker 1>it's nice to wrestle with your little </v>
<v Speaker 1>girl kids and little kids really like </v>

1511
01:23:33.161 --> 01:23:36.310
<v Speaker 1>rough and tumble play into and to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1512
01:23:36.311 --> 01:23:39.550
<v Speaker 1>encourage her to be courageous and </v>
<v Speaker 1>forthright.</v>

1513
01:23:39.730 --> 01:23:40.563
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're lucky you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can support her in both elements of </v>

1514
01:23:42.821 --> 01:23:45.070
<v Speaker 1>her personality and that would be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>really good thing to do.</v>

1515
01:23:45.430 --> 01:23:49.210
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't let her wrap.</v>

1516
01:23:49.211 --> 01:23:52.090
<v Speaker 1>Are you around her little finger either?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another thing too.</v>

1517
01:23:56.980 --> 01:24:00.190
<v Speaker 1>Were there any lectures or lectures </v>
<v Speaker 1>series that you found helpful to you?</v>

1518
01:24:00.191 --> 01:24:02.800
<v Speaker 1>This Nathan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like yours have been to so many?</v>

1519
01:24:03.220 --> 01:24:04.053
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nathan,</v>

1520
01:24:04.390 --> 01:24:07.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say not really.</v>

1521
01:24:08.650 --> 01:24:09.483
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although,</v>

1522
01:24:10.390 --> 01:24:11.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I went,</v>

1523
01:24:11.321 --> 01:24:13.990
<v Speaker 1>I went to this little college called </v>
<v Speaker 1>Grand Prairie Regional College.</v>

1524
01:24:13.991 --> 01:24:17.220
<v Speaker 1>It was way the hell up in northern </v>
<v Speaker 1>Alberta and um,</v>

1525
01:24:18.070 --> 01:24:18.903
<v Speaker 1>there's only 600 people that went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was an adjunct of the University of </v>

1526
01:24:21.670 --> 01:24:22.600
<v Speaker 1>Alberta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still exists.</v>

1527
01:24:22.810 --> 01:24:24.830
<v Speaker 1>It's really lovely building.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1528
01:24:25.240 --> 01:24:26.073
<v Speaker 1>and we had professors there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an English professor and a political </v>

1529
01:24:31.061 --> 01:24:32.830
<v Speaker 1>science professor in biology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>professor,</v>

1530
01:24:32.831 --> 01:24:33.664
<v Speaker 1>philosophy professor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that I still remember little </v>

1531
01:24:35.621 --> 01:24:36.454
<v Speaker 1>seminars and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got deeply into the material and I </v>

1532
01:24:39.911 --> 01:24:42.250
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really helped me a lot.</v>

1533
01:24:42.251 --> 01:24:43.084
<v Speaker 1>This English professor really taught me </v>
<v Speaker 1>to write to because he just slashed my </v>

1534
01:24:45.821 --> 01:24:46.654
<v Speaker 1>essays to ribbons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was really upset the first time I got </v>

1535
01:24:49.270 --> 01:24:52.530
<v Speaker 1>a bad grade because I'd always got good </v>
<v Speaker 1>grades and my papers in high school,</v>

1536
01:24:52.540 --> 01:24:54.220
<v Speaker 1>even though they were dreadful.</v>

1537
01:24:54.580 --> 01:24:55.211
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1538
01:24:55.211 --> 01:25:00.211
<v Speaker 1>I was verbally intelligent enough to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to compose an essay that was better</v>

1539
01:25:00.671 --> 01:25:04.480
<v Speaker 1>than most with very little effort and </v>
<v Speaker 1>with very little quality.</v>

1540
01:25:04.930 --> 01:25:05.763
<v Speaker 1>And so that was very influential to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I did a lot of reading under the </v>

1541
01:25:09.191 --> 01:25:13.090
<v Speaker 1>tutelage of those professors in these </v>
<v Speaker 1>tiny little courses in my first year.</v>

1542
01:25:13.091 --> 01:25:17.410
<v Speaker 1>But mostly what's been helpful to me </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been books.</v>

1543
01:25:17.830 --> 01:25:20.020
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read Nietzsche,</v>

1544
01:25:20.290 --> 01:25:23.410
<v Speaker 1>I didn't read all of nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll read all that was easily,</v>

1545
01:25:23.650 --> 01:25:24.483
<v Speaker 1>easily accessible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>published works of nature in sequential </v>

1546
01:25:28.151 --> 01:25:28.984
<v Speaker 1>order in the order in which they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>written when I was in my twenties and I </v>

1547
01:25:31.871 --> 01:25:35.600
<v Speaker 1>read everything that young had published</v>
<v Speaker 1>it when I was in my twenties and um,</v>

1548
01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:36.753
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and well and the same with a wide </v>

1549
01:25:38.441 --> 01:25:39.274
<v Speaker 1>variety of other authors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so those were like lecture series </v>

1550
01:25:40.931 --> 01:25:43.150
<v Speaker 1>and they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was unbelievably useful to me.</v>

1551
01:25:43.420 --> 01:25:45.130
<v Speaker 1>I put some of those books on my reading </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1552
01:25:45.131 --> 01:25:46.270
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1553
01:25:48.450 --> 01:25:49.283
<v Speaker 1>could you please tell us your second </v>
<v Speaker 1>ghost story as mentioned on h three h </v>

1554
01:25:52.201 --> 01:25:55.380
<v Speaker 1>three podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God Nicholas,</v>

1555
01:25:55.560 --> 01:25:56.393
<v Speaker 1>if you asked me that at the next q and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people voted up then I'll tell the </v>

1556
01:25:58.801 --> 01:25:59.634
<v Speaker 1>story but I can't right now cause it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>long story and I'm just about out of </v>

1557
01:26:02.660 --> 01:26:06.020
<v Speaker 1>voice and brain and time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

1558
01:26:06.260 --> 01:26:08.540
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to answer two more </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions I think,</v>

1559
01:26:08.541 --> 01:26:12.860
<v Speaker 1>and then I'm going to stop because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>really am running out of,</v>

1560
01:26:13.150 --> 01:26:13.983
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1561
01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:18.410
<v Speaker 1>words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>

1562
01:26:19.750 --> 01:26:20.440
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1563
01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:21.530
<v Speaker 1>Kay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

1564
01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:24.050
<v Speaker 1>have you read much Thomas Soul?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In many ways,</v>

1565
01:26:24.051 --> 01:26:24.884
<v Speaker 1>he filled your societal role for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>last generation from a different </v>

1566
01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:30.110
<v Speaker 1>academic perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just reading his book right now.</v>

1567
01:26:30.111 --> 01:26:31.220
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1568
01:26:31.221 --> 01:26:32.750
<v Speaker 1>what is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>white.</v>

1569
01:26:33.710 --> 01:26:34.100
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1570
01:26:34.100 --> 01:26:35.030
<v Speaker 1>Black,</v>
<v Speaker 1>red Nixon,</v>

1571
01:26:35.031 --> 01:26:36.350
<v Speaker 1>white liberals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that right?</v>

1572
01:26:36.380 --> 01:26:39.710
<v Speaker 1>Black rednecks and white liberals.</v>

1573
01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:44.233
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1574
01:26:44.270 --> 01:26:45.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1575
01:26:46.780 --> 01:26:47.570
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1576
01:26:47.570 --> 01:26:50.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm still making my mind up about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's quite a radical idea.</v>

1577
01:26:50.781 --> 01:26:51.614
<v Speaker 1>I mean in that book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so claims that black urban culture is </v>

1578
01:26:55.611 --> 01:27:00.410
<v Speaker 1>actually a derivative of southern </v>
<v Speaker 1>cracker culture and that that in turn is</v>

1579
01:27:00.411 --> 01:27:05.411
<v Speaker 1>a derivative of a rather dysfunctional </v>
<v Speaker 1>highland dysfunctional British culture.</v>

1580
01:27:07.890 --> 01:27:08.723
<v Speaker 1>What would you call rural called British</v>
<v Speaker 1>rural culture from a couple of hundred </v>

1581
01:27:12.350 --> 01:27:13.183
<v Speaker 1>years ago?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1582
01:27:13.970 --> 01:27:14.803
<v Speaker 1>I'm still thinking it through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find the book really interesting and </v>

1583
01:27:16.970 --> 01:27:20.360
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't surprise me if it was true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's quite original.</v>

1584
01:27:20.361 --> 01:27:22.280
<v Speaker 1>The thesis is quite original.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm,</v>

1585
01:27:22.820 --> 01:27:23.653
<v Speaker 1>I'm working my way through that right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now and I don't have anything much more </v>

1586
01:27:27.831 --> 01:27:28.664
<v Speaker 1>intelligent to say than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you share with us your reading </v>

1587
01:27:44.951 --> 01:27:46.120
<v Speaker 1>habits?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Max says,</v>

1588
01:27:46.450 --> 01:27:48.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm skipping over some questions,</v>

1589
01:27:48.251 --> 01:27:49.084
<v Speaker 1>but I have to answer some easier ones </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm out of the capacity to </v>

1590
01:27:52.031 --> 01:27:55.540
<v Speaker 1>answer difficult ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1591
01:27:55.541 --> 01:27:56.374
<v Speaker 1>I answered this one instead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you could talk to Donald Trump for a </v>

1592
01:27:58.940 --> 01:27:59.773
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you try to say or convinced </v>

1593
01:28:00.841 --> 01:28:01.674
<v Speaker 1>him about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I would try to convince </v>

1594
01:28:03.561 --> 01:28:04.394
<v Speaker 1>them about things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't actually try to convince people </v>

1595
01:28:06.651 --> 01:28:07.910
<v Speaker 1>about things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think</v>

1596
01:28:08.830 --> 01:28:12.070
<v Speaker 1>I tried to ask them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd ask him a whole bunch of questions.</v>

1597
01:28:12.071 --> 01:28:15.400
<v Speaker 1>I try to figure out how we thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm really curious about that.</v>

1598
01:28:15.401 --> 01:28:17.980
<v Speaker 1>I'd ask him all sorts of questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ask,</v>

1599
01:28:17.981 --> 01:28:19.750
<v Speaker 1>see if I could find out what he was up </v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

1600
01:28:19.780 --> 01:28:20.613
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to know what he's aiming at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to know why he think he became </v>

1601
01:28:23.711 --> 01:28:25.120
<v Speaker 1>president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he did right,</v>

1602
01:28:25.150 --> 01:28:26.860
<v Speaker 1>what he did wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1603
01:28:26.870 --> 01:28:27.703
<v Speaker 1>what he dreads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what he would consider a </v>

1604
01:28:29.651 --> 01:28:30.484
<v Speaker 1>catastrophic failure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where he thinks his biggest weaknesses </v>

1605
01:28:33.221 --> 01:28:35.380
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he'd like to leave as a,</v>

1606
01:28:35.770 --> 01:28:37.740
<v Speaker 1>as a legacy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1607
01:28:38.790 --> 01:28:39.230
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1608
01:28:39.230 --> 01:28:41.030
<v Speaker 1>That would be fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But see,</v>

1609
01:28:41.390 --> 01:28:45.950
<v Speaker 1>I find generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's much more interesting to ask people</v>

1610
01:28:45.951 --> 01:28:48.350
<v Speaker 1>questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially people like that than ever to</v>

1611
01:28:48.351 --> 01:28:51.050
<v Speaker 1>try to convince them of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the thing is,</v>

1612
01:28:51.140 --> 01:28:54.050
<v Speaker 1>I already know what I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have no idea what he knows or what</v>

1613
01:28:54.051 --> 01:28:54.884
<v Speaker 1>he's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it'd be amazing to be able to </v>

1614
01:28:56.450 --> 01:28:57.283
<v Speaker 1>talk to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I have a bit of that opportunity </v>

1615
01:28:59.301 --> 01:29:02.670
<v Speaker 1>now in Canada because I've been speaking</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a lot of political figures in Canada.</v>

1616
01:29:02.671 --> 01:29:04.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have that opportunity in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe,</v>

1617
01:29:04.471 --> 01:29:05.304
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of what you want to do when you </v>

1618
01:29:08.101 --> 01:29:10.560
<v Speaker 1>meet people as asked them questions </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

1619
01:29:10.561 --> 01:29:12.450
<v Speaker 1>they'll tell you all sorts of things you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know.</v>

1620
01:29:12.451 --> 01:29:13.284
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's also an entry point to a really </v>

1621
01:29:15.061 --> 01:29:17.760
<v Speaker 1>good conversation is to ask questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I would do.</v>

1622
01:29:17.761 --> 01:29:20.910
<v Speaker 1>I'd ask questions like mad until he </v>
<v Speaker 1>chased me away.</v>

1623
01:29:21.270 --> 01:29:22.103
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1624
01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:25.290
<v Speaker 1>one more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Daniel,</v>

1625
01:29:25.291 --> 01:29:26.124
<v Speaker 1>shall I like this question?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How would you give a speech to soldiers </v>

1626
01:29:28.291 --> 01:29:29.124
<v Speaker 1>entering the army about responsibility?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will command at Basic Training Unit </v>

1627
01:29:31.981 --> 01:29:34.290
<v Speaker 1>and address young soldiers advice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Daniel,</v>

1628
01:29:34.470 --> 01:29:36.690
<v Speaker 1>what I would do is you can take about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1629
01:29:37.380 --> 01:29:40.080
<v Speaker 1>you could ask them to complete the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future authoring program.</v>

1630
01:29:40.590 --> 01:29:42.000
<v Speaker 1>I think that would be a really good </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>

1631
01:29:42.001 --> 01:29:46.950
<v Speaker 1>But if you don't want to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you should ask them to like get them</v>

1632
01:29:46.951 --> 01:29:47.784
<v Speaker 1>to sit down for 90 minutes or an hour or</v>
<v Speaker 1>even I would use the future authoring </v>

1633
01:29:51.331 --> 01:29:52.164
<v Speaker 1>program cause it's just easier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But ask them what sort of soldiers they </v>

1634
01:29:56.311 --> 01:29:57.144
<v Speaker 1>want to be in three to five years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they could put themselves together </v>

1635
01:30:00.060 --> 01:30:00.893
<v Speaker 1>and be the best military and serve the </v>
<v Speaker 1>purpose that they enrolled in the </v>

1636
01:30:06.091 --> 01:30:08.340
<v Speaker 1>military for in the best possible </v>
<v Speaker 1>manner,</v>

1637
01:30:08.760 --> 01:30:12.120
<v Speaker 1>what would they look like as their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>future ideal?</v>

1638
01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:14.760
<v Speaker 1>They have to think it through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1639
01:30:15.870 --> 01:30:17.410
<v Speaker 1>and then the other thing you can ask </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

1640
01:30:17.411 --> 01:30:18.244
<v Speaker 1>and this is also part of the future </v>
<v Speaker 1>authoring program is like what would </v>

1641
01:30:21.061 --> 01:30:23.220
<v Speaker 1>your life look like three to five years </v>
<v Speaker 1>down the road?</v>

1642
01:30:23.221 --> 01:30:26.520
<v Speaker 1>If you fail in your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your desire to,</v>

1643
01:30:27.090 --> 01:30:27.923
<v Speaker 1>to become a proper soldier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What sort of hell are you courting by </v>

1644
01:30:31.830 --> 01:30:32.663
<v Speaker 1>failing to take on the responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you can get them to think that </v>

1645
01:30:35.191 --> 01:30:36.210
<v Speaker 1>through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1646
01:30:36.211 --> 01:30:39.360
<v Speaker 1>the probability that they'll do a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>job will vastly increase,</v>

1647
01:30:39.390 --> 01:30:40.223
<v Speaker 1>really vastly increase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lots of young people have never thought </v>

1648
01:30:42.451 --> 01:30:46.170
<v Speaker 1>about who it is that they could be if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they started to be the person they could</v>

1649
01:30:46.171 --> 01:30:47.004
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so getting them to think about that </v>

1650
01:30:48.571 --> 01:30:50.280
<v Speaker 1>write about it would be extremely </v>
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

1651
01:30:50.281 --> 01:30:51.114
<v Speaker 1>So what I would do first of all is get </v>
<v Speaker 1>them to do the writing and the thinking </v>

1652
01:30:54.991 --> 01:30:58.170
<v Speaker 1>and then give the speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe once they've done it,</v>

1653
01:30:59.130 --> 01:30:59.963
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could ask them if they'd be willing </v>

1654
01:31:00.961 --> 01:31:03.240
<v Speaker 1>to share with you some of what they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>written.</v>

1655
01:31:03.241 --> 01:31:04.074
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't make that mandatory because </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they might not be able to write </v>

1656
01:31:05.791 --> 01:31:08.310
<v Speaker 1>about it honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's how it would go about it.</v>

1657
01:31:09.210 --> 01:31:11.370
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1658
01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:13.740
<v Speaker 1>Well I'm done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1659
01:31:13.830 --> 01:31:14.663
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you very much for tuning in and </v>

1660
01:31:18.031 --> 01:31:21.180
<v Speaker 1>thank you all for your support and um,</v>

1661
01:31:22.920 --> 01:31:27.480
<v Speaker 1>keep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what else?</v>

1662
01:31:28.380 --> 01:31:29.213
<v Speaker 1>I hope that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have lots of plans for 2018 and I </v>

1663
01:31:33.771 --> 01:31:37.430
<v Speaker 1>would like to keep you all in the loop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so all posts a lot of those.</v>

1664
01:31:37.490 --> 01:31:39.230
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should tell you this.</v>

1665
01:31:39.720 --> 01:31:41.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be giving some public </v>
<v Speaker 1>talks,</v>

1668
01:31:48.660 --> 01:31:50.120
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll try to say them in order.</v>

1669
01:31:50.121 --> 01:31:50.954
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be in London and then I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be in Amsterdam and then I'm </v>

1670
01:31:54.141 --> 01:31:56.630
<v Speaker 1>going to be in New York,</v>

1671

1672

<v Speaker 1>Then I'm going to be in a bunch of </v>

1673
01:32:04.961 --> 01:32:07.000
<v Speaker 1>cities across Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in major cities,</v>

1674
01:32:07.001 --> 01:32:08.140
<v Speaker 1>Winnipeg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Edmonton,</v>

1675
01:32:08.170 --> 01:32:10.060
<v Speaker 1>Ottawa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Calgary,</v>

1676
01:32:10.180 --> 01:32:11.013
<v Speaker 1>maybe this little town,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grand prairie that I went to college in </v>

1677
01:32:13.030 --> 01:32:13.863
<v Speaker 1>Vancouver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I'm going to go down to </v>

1678
01:32:16.091 --> 01:32:19.390
<v Speaker 1>Australia and I'm going to go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Melbourne and Sydney and Brisbane.</v>

1679
01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:24.960
<v Speaker 1>And so I'll post</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dates on my website very soon.</v>

1680
01:32:26.230 --> 01:32:29.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm still making the arrangements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you want to come and listen to</v>

1681
01:32:29.231 --> 01:32:30.064
<v Speaker 1>me talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you'll have the opportunity to do </v>

1682
01:32:31.931 --> 01:32:34.210
<v Speaker 1>so and so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1683
01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:37.630
<v Speaker 1>So I have to say good night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so good night to all of you.</v>

1684
01:32:37.631 --> 01:32:38.464
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1685
01:32:39.340 --> 01:32:44.340
<v Speaker 1>what would I like to close with?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1686
01:32:45.971 --> 01:32:46.804
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad you're tuning in and I hope </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're using the information that </v>

1687
01:32:52.810 --> 01:32:57.310
<v Speaker 1>you're finding as a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>tuning in to put your lives together,</v>

1688
01:32:57.340 --> 01:32:58.173
<v Speaker 1>because it would really be good in 2018 </v>
<v Speaker 1>if a whole bunch of people did </v>

1689
01:33:03.041 --> 01:33:03.874
<v Speaker 1>everything they could to put their lives</v>
<v Speaker 1>together because then maybe we could </v>

1690
01:33:06.701 --> 01:33:11.200
<v Speaker 1>avoid this idiot catastrophe that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>seem to be dreadfully sliding towards.</v>

1691
01:33:11.380 --> 01:33:14.260
<v Speaker 1>And so that would be lovely if we could </v>
<v Speaker 1>just not do that.</v>

1692
01:33:14.710 --> 01:33:17.260
<v Speaker 1>So until next time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bye bye.</v>
