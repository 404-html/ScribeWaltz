<v Speaker 1>So that's greg.</v>

28
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.530
<v Speaker 2>Hello everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's quite an intro.</v>

29
00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.550
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm just going to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You follow me around everywhere that </v>

30
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:03.720
<v Speaker 2>before I enter a room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dislikes me.</v>

31
00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

32
00:02:05.081 --> 00:02:10.081
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the sort of intro that makes </v>

33
00:02:10.081 --> 00:02:11.980
<v Speaker 1>everyone hopes you're a real son of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bitch after reading an intro like that </v>

34
00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.810
<v Speaker 1>so they can make it morally dislike you </v>
<v Speaker 1>the best thing.</v>

35
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.410
<v Speaker 2>Dislike Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you know.</v>

36
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

37
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.180
<v Speaker 1>So we're not gonna talk too much today </v>
<v Speaker 1>about Greg's previous exploits.</v>

38
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.500
<v Speaker 1>Instead we're going to talk about some </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the work he's been doing in the </v>

39
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.720
<v Speaker 1>political realm recently and the reasons</v>
<v Speaker 1>for doing that.</v>

40
00:02:27.721 --> 00:02:29.490
<v Speaker 1>So Greg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to let you take that away.</v>

41
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

42
00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.450
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I write thrillers and I have.</v>

43
00:02:34.451 --> 00:02:39.451
<v Speaker 2>The shorthand that I always give is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>about half of my friends were born </v>

44
00:02:39.451 --> 00:02:39.451
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christian navy seal,</v>

45
00:02:39.451 --> 00:02:43.591
<v Speaker 2>snipers and half my friends are gay acw </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I taught equally in the red and blue</v>

46
00:02:44.101 --> 00:02:45.720
<v Speaker 2>states.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My readership is very,</v>

47
00:02:45.721 --> 00:02:50.721
<v Speaker 2>very diverse and I think because of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a real ear for the buzz words and</v>

48
00:02:51.721 --> 00:02:54.780
<v Speaker 2>phrases and ideological shorthand that </v>
<v Speaker 2>really shut people up.</v>

49
00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.530
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that just make them stop listening.</v>

50
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.120
<v Speaker 2>My politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

51
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.130
<v Speaker 1>I'd say I'm a bit more of a classical </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberal and one of the things that I </v>

52
00:03:05.681 --> 00:03:10.681
<v Speaker 1>talk a lot about is there certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>phrases that we've run up from both </v>

53
00:03:10.681 --> 00:03:13.771
<v Speaker 1>sides that just make people completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>stopped and it's not dissimilar to what </v>

54
00:03:13.771 --> 00:03:13.900
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to do when we're writing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

55
00:03:13.901 --> 00:03:17.260
<v Speaker 1>If you write and use buzzwords and catch</v>
<v Speaker 1>phrases and cliches,</v>

56
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.530
<v Speaker 1>it's less interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you already know what you think of 40</v>

57
00:03:20.531 --> 00:03:23.920
<v Speaker 1>start writing and there's no room for </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovery along the way,</v>

58
00:03:23.921 --> 00:03:25.360
<v Speaker 1>then you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not real writing.</v>

59
00:03:25.361 --> 00:03:26.560
<v Speaker 1>It's propaganda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

60
00:03:26.561 --> 00:03:31.561
<v Speaker 1>It's an ramped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're never going to be surprised by </v>

61
00:03:31.561 --> 00:03:32.500
<v Speaker 1>something in the third act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a real overlap for that.</v>

62
00:03:32.501 --> 00:03:37.501
<v Speaker 1>But I found,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so one of the things that I've been </v>

63
00:03:37.501 --> 00:03:39.601
<v Speaker 1>trying to do a given how polarized I </v>
<v Speaker 1>have found discourse to be and how I </v>

64
00:03:39.601 --> 00:03:44.041
<v Speaker 1>found myself moving between vastly </v>
<v Speaker 1>different worlds is to try and commit </v>

65
00:03:44.041 --> 00:03:47.560
<v Speaker 1>myself to ending or contributing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>ending polarizing discourse.</v>

66
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.590
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so part of that is that I've been </v>

67
00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.811
<v Speaker 1>focused on trying to rebrand the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Democratic Party of working with a </v>

68
00:03:54.811 --> 00:03:57.850
<v Speaker 1>lot of different candidates and entities</v>
<v Speaker 1>in an effort to get away from,</v>

69
00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.340
<v Speaker 1>from gridlocked and more towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>solutions.</v>

70
00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.150
<v Speaker 1>I have a view that's a lot like Jonathan</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heit who you've interviewed it lanes who</v>

71
00:04:05.151 --> 00:04:10.151
<v Speaker 1>I think is a great description of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>need and necessity for both </v>

72
00:04:10.151 --> 00:04:11.810
<v Speaker 1>conservatives and liberals in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

73
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.960
<v Speaker 1>conservatives like walls around things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

74
00:04:13.961 --> 00:04:16.840
<v Speaker 1>They're like walls around gender.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They like walls around countries.</v>

75
00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.960
<v Speaker 1>Build a wall is sort of a brilliant </v>
<v Speaker 1>republican slogan.</v>

76
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.870
<v Speaker 1>And the job of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of liberals is to say,</v>

77
00:04:22.871 --> 00:04:25.630
<v Speaker 1>hang on a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that wall is to impenetrable,</v>

78
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.140
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to have new ideas and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and then we'll stop me to die.</v>

79
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.320
<v Speaker 1>And so for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you and I've talked before about how</v>

80
00:04:32.321 --> 00:04:37.321
<v Speaker 1>it's also the case for inventors and </v>
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurs who kind of create things </v>

81
00:04:37.321 --> 00:04:38.560
<v Speaker 1>which tends to be more of a liberal </v>
<v Speaker 1>leaning,</v>

82
00:04:38.561 --> 00:04:43.561
<v Speaker 1>but if you want them run effectively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often you need conservative managers to </v>

83
00:04:43.561 --> 00:04:43.561
<v Speaker 1>come in.</v>

84
00:04:43.561 --> 00:04:47.350
<v Speaker 1>And so I would want there to be stronger</v>
<v Speaker 1>parties on both sides.</v>

85
00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want there to be better discourse.</v>

86
00:04:49.241 --> 00:04:51.460
<v Speaker 1>I think if there's a stronger Republican</v>
<v Speaker 1>party,</v>

87
00:04:51.461 --> 00:04:56.461
<v Speaker 1>it makes the Democratic Party have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>raise their game and come up with </v>

88
00:04:56.461 --> 00:04:57.940
<v Speaker 1>solutions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And out of the one thing I will say that</v>

89
00:04:57.941 --> 00:05:02.941
<v Speaker 1>has been common and everyone who I </v>
<v Speaker 1>talked to is nobody's thrilled with the </v>

90
00:05:02.941 --> 00:05:05.290
<v Speaker 1>level of political discourse right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a couple of things there that</v>

91
00:05:05.291 --> 00:05:10.291
<v Speaker 1>are really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you talk about the necessity for </v>

92
00:05:10.291 --> 00:05:14.080
<v Speaker 1>a high quality representation on both </v>
<v Speaker 1>sides of the political,</v>

93
00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.250
<v Speaker 1>a political,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you call that continuum.</v>

94
00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:23.280
<v Speaker 1>Let's say there are really powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>temperamental and philosophical reasons </v>

95
00:05:23.741 --> 00:05:28.741
<v Speaker 1>for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now you mentioned that the liberal </v>

96
00:05:28.741 --> 00:05:31.741
<v Speaker 1>types tend to be entrepreneurs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>creators and a conservative types tend </v>

97
00:05:31.741 --> 00:05:33.550
<v Speaker 1>to be managers and administrators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that that's pretty well documented in</v>

98
00:05:33.551 --> 00:05:36.630
<v Speaker 1>the psychological literature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you see echoes of that and you,</v>

99
00:05:36.631 --> 00:05:41.631
<v Speaker 1>you mentioned the border issue as well </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of course to categorize things </v>

100
00:05:41.631 --> 00:05:44.410
<v Speaker 1>we have to put boundaries around them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but boundaries can artificially separate</v>

101
00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.420
<v Speaker 1>and make things stagnant as well.</v>

102
00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:51.420
<v Speaker 1>So we have to have a continual </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion about exactly where the </v>

103
00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.001
<v Speaker 1>boundaries should be drawn without ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also presuming that we should just do </v>

104
00:05:54.001 --> 00:05:55.930
<v Speaker 1>away with boundaries all together </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that does away with category.</v>

105
00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:01.460
<v Speaker 1>Then with regards to hierarchies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well no know it seems to be the job of </v>

106
00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:06.041
<v Speaker 1>the right wing to put forward the </v>
<v Speaker 1>proposition that hierarchies are </v>

107
00:06:06.041 --> 00:06:08.060
<v Speaker 1>necessary from an organizational </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

108
00:06:08.061 --> 00:06:11.810
<v Speaker 1>So if a bunch of people decided to go do</v>
<v Speaker 1>something of value,</v>

109
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.230
<v Speaker 1>let's say it's a collective value as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well as individual value,</v>

110
00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:20.650
<v Speaker 1>then inevitably when they operate </v>
<v Speaker 1>cooperatively and competitively they're </v>

111
00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:24.371
<v Speaker 1>going to produce a hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the hierarchy is actually a tool to </v>

112
00:06:24.371 --> 00:06:26.270
<v Speaker 1>accomplish that task in the social </v>
<v Speaker 1>arena.</v>

113
00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:31.650
<v Speaker 1>But the problem with that is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy can become overly rigid and </v>

114
00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.040
<v Speaker 1>corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it can dispossessed people,</v>

115
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without,</v>

116
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.800
<v Speaker 1>without that dispossession being a </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary function of the task that the </v>

117
00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:42.140
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy's attempting to perform.</v>

118
00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.580
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's always both,</v>

119
00:06:46.581 --> 00:06:47.270
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

120
00:06:47.271 --> 00:06:51.080
<v Speaker 2>it's always that we needed to organize </v>
<v Speaker 2>and there always are in equities.</v>

121
00:06:51.081 --> 00:06:54.770
<v Speaker 2>The result of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing that I have found is that when</v>

122
00:06:54.771 --> 00:06:58.160
<v Speaker 2>people lock into political conversations</v>
<v Speaker 2>from one side or the other,</v>

123
00:06:58.161 --> 00:07:00.230
<v Speaker 2>it becomes all or nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for me,</v>

124
00:07:00.231 --> 00:07:02.030
<v Speaker 2>nothing gets accomplished in all or </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>

125
00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.640
<v Speaker 2>And so a straw man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

126
00:07:04.641 --> 00:07:09.641
<v Speaker 2>Democrats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that all of them just want to tear down </v>

127
00:07:09.641 --> 00:07:12.101
<v Speaker 2>the whole system and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are some of the louder voices on </v>

128
00:07:12.101 --> 00:07:15.581
<v Speaker 2>twitter isn't helpful anymore than a </v>
<v Speaker 2>claim that Republicans have no interest </v>

129
00:07:15.581 --> 00:07:16.980
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever in the people who are just </v>
<v Speaker 2>disaster.</v>

130
00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:19.610
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of what's important is to look</v>
<v Speaker 2>at,</v>

131
00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:24.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conservatives who are thoughtful.</v>

132
00:07:24.471 --> 00:07:27.110
<v Speaker 2>It's not like they love the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are dispossessed.</v>

133
00:07:27.111 --> 00:07:32.111
<v Speaker 2>So the question becomes how do we all </v>
<v Speaker 2>help that and how do we actually have a </v>

134
00:07:32.111 --> 00:07:35.411
<v Speaker 2>discussion and how do we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do we get away from the fact that </v>

135
00:07:35.411 --> 00:07:39.131
<v Speaker 2>compromise toward solutions is somehow a</v>
<v Speaker 2>betrayal that if you compromise anything</v>

136
00:07:40.191 --> 00:07:45.191
<v Speaker 2>from the furthest extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your sort of portraying your own </v>

137
00:07:45.191 --> 00:07:45.191
<v Speaker 2>ideology and your own people?</v>

138
00:07:45.191 --> 00:07:49.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I think partly you do that by </v>

139
00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:49.680
<v Speaker 1>focusing on specific problems instead of</v>
<v Speaker 1>provider radiological solutions.</v>

140
00:07:49.681 --> 00:07:54.450
<v Speaker 1>And that's so part of what we're trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to discuss today and to contribute to is</v>

141
00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:57.230
<v Speaker 1>that they raise centralization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

142
00:07:57.231 --> 00:08:02.231
<v Speaker 1>of the political parties and also to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make a case for the necessity of </v>

143
00:08:02.231 --> 00:08:02.940
<v Speaker 1>intelligent discourse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Knowing that people on both sides of the</v>

144
00:08:02.941 --> 00:08:05.100
<v Speaker 1>political spectrum have something </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent to say.</v>

145
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:10.670
<v Speaker 1>So the conservatives have every reason </v>
<v Speaker 1>to put forward the proposition that </v>

146
00:08:10.741 --> 00:08:13.140
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies are both inevitable and </v>
<v Speaker 1>useful,</v>

147
00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:16.770
<v Speaker 1>but also to keep firmly in mind that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can become corrupt and that they do</v>

148
00:08:16.771 --> 00:08:21.771
<v Speaker 1>tend to dispossess and the liberals have</v>
<v Speaker 1>every reason to keep in mind that </v>

149
00:08:21.771 --> 00:08:23.640
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies are absolutely necessary in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order to get things done,</v>

150
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000
<v Speaker 1>but that the dispossessed need a voice </v>
<v Speaker 1>so that the system remains both </v>

151
00:08:29.281 --> 00:08:34.281
<v Speaker 1>permeable and fair and it's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary for both sides to have some </v>

152
00:08:34.281 --> 00:08:36.210
<v Speaker 1>respect for the position of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>alternative.</v>

153
00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.430
<v Speaker 1>The alternative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>temperamental type,</v>

154
00:08:38.431 --> 00:08:38.970
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

155
00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.430
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where we have to meet in,</v>

156
00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:45.430
<v Speaker 2>in rational enlightenment discourse or </v>
<v Speaker 2>else we can't win.</v>

157
00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:47.830
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talked a lot about the big,</v>

158
00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:52.920
<v Speaker 2>the big five personality traits and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways that it orients differently in </v>

159
00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:56.371
<v Speaker 2>politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like Liberals or higher and </v>

160
00:08:56.371 --> 00:08:56.371
<v Speaker 2>empathy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

161
00:08:56.371 --> 00:08:59.220
<v Speaker 2>In higher and openness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why a lot of artists do you find </v>

162
00:08:59.220 --> 00:08:59.220
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

163
00:08:59.220 --> 00:08:59.270
<v Speaker 2>tend to be liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

164
00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:04.820
<v Speaker 2>at least the good ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we have bruce springsteen and on </v>

165
00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:05.090
<v Speaker 2>the other side it's hard for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

166
00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.680
<v Speaker 2>for president trump to fill up an arena </v>
<v Speaker 2>with people who,</v>

167
00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:12.860
<v Speaker 2>who are the artists of a certain caliber</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

168
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:17.960
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't mean that that higher empathy</v>
<v Speaker 2>is better and I think often when </v>

169
00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:21.201
<v Speaker 2>liberals are talking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to push through only </v>

170
00:09:21.201 --> 00:09:24.440
<v Speaker 2>apathy and higher empathy and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to educate people in the higher </v>

171
00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:24.440
<v Speaker 2>epa well to fix psychological traits.</v>

172
00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:25.860
<v Speaker 2>And the other thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

173
00:09:25.861 --> 00:09:30.861
<v Speaker 2>Republicans or conservatives tend to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>high on conscientiousness and </v>

174
00:09:30.861 --> 00:09:33.720
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness codes for a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that are really useful,</v>

175
00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:35.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>codes for better health,</v>

176
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:40.400
<v Speaker 2>better finances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more stable marriages and longer </v>

177
00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:40.560
<v Speaker 2>lifespan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things when I'm advising,</v>

178
00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:42.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>democrats is like,</v>

179
00:09:42.511 --> 00:09:47.511
<v Speaker 2>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have to win an argument on the </v>

180
00:09:47.511 --> 00:09:47.511
<v Speaker 2>merits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to make a better argument.</v>

181
00:09:47.511 --> 00:09:52.131
<v Speaker 2>If you're losing people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't just go to them and say be </v>

182
00:09:52.131 --> 00:09:52.131
<v Speaker 2>more empathetic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not an argument,</v>

183
00:09:52.131 --> 00:09:56.840
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to President Clinton and </v>

184
00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:56.840
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't you just be an introvert?</v>

185
00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:01.820
<v Speaker 2>These are sort of fixed traits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the other thing is is a lot of </v>

186
00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:05.271
<v Speaker 2>conservatives are doing fine over there </v>
<v Speaker 2>where they're stable marriages and </v>

187
00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:05.271
<v Speaker 2>longer life.</v>

188
00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:07.900
<v Speaker 1>Well in the empathy issue is interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well because it's easy for that to be</v>

189
00:10:07.901 --> 00:10:12.280
<v Speaker 1>regarded reflexively as a virtue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but an excess of pity,</v>

190
00:10:12.281 --> 00:10:17.281
<v Speaker 1>let's say can be destructive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a whole psychoanalytic </v>

191
00:10:17.281 --> 00:10:20.131
<v Speaker 1>literature on the negative consequences </v>
<v Speaker 1>of of fostering overdependence let's </v>

192
00:10:20.131 --> 00:10:25.111
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a real problem and there is </v>

193
00:10:25.111 --> 00:10:25.420
<v Speaker 1>our managerial literature too that </v>
<v Speaker 1>suggests that less agreeable managers do</v>

194
00:10:25.421 --> 00:10:29.290
<v Speaker 1>better as well as less agreeable people </v>
<v Speaker 1>in general having higher incomes because</v>

195
00:10:29.291 --> 00:10:30.970
<v Speaker 1>they're better at arguing for </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

196
00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:36.330
<v Speaker 1>So it is really necessary to give some </v>
<v Speaker 1>consideration to the fact that each of </v>

197
00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:40.141
<v Speaker 1>these temperaments has it marked </v>
<v Speaker 1>advantages and disadvantages and a </v>

198
00:10:40.141 --> 00:10:43.921
<v Speaker 1>proper niche where it can function and </v>
<v Speaker 1>and other places where it actually </v>

199
00:10:43.921 --> 00:10:43.921
<v Speaker 1>constitutes a problem.</v>

200
00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:49.280
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where we have to rise above </v>

201
00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:49.280
<v Speaker 2>ourselves in me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like where did we meet?</v>

202
00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:54.260
<v Speaker 2>We meet in freedom of speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a reason it's the first </v>

203
00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:54.260
<v Speaker 2>amendment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

204
00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:58.041
<v Speaker 2>if I was dumb enough to be single issue </v>
<v Speaker 2>voter and that would be my single issue </v>

205
00:10:58.041 --> 00:11:00.870
<v Speaker 2>because part of it is as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as as a classical liberal,</v>

206
00:11:00.871 --> 00:11:03.990
<v Speaker 2>I tend to approach Steve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a strong amount of empathy,</v>

207
00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:09.260
<v Speaker 2>but I also realize that that's not a </v>
<v Speaker 2>trait that I can map on to everybody </v>

208
00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:09.540
<v Speaker 2>else in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're having a discussion that I have to</v>

209
00:11:09.541 --> 00:11:13.050
<v Speaker 2>actually meet and make arguments for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for people who,</v>

210
00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:18.080
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who approached the world in different </v>

211
00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:19.731
<v Speaker 2>ways and have different kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>successes to make higher conscientious </v>

212
00:11:19.731 --> 00:11:20.880
<v Speaker 2>arguments in a way that appeals more </v>
<v Speaker 2>broadly.</v>

213
00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:24.480
<v Speaker 2>And I mean that's free marketplace of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas and we have to meet and figure out</v>

214
00:11:24.481 --> 00:11:29.481
<v Speaker 2>and discuss these matters and if we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>not doing it in words we're doing with </v>

215
00:11:29.481 --> 00:11:29.481
<v Speaker 2>fists tonight.</v>

216
00:11:29.481 --> 00:11:31.710
<v Speaker 1>The other problem with agreeableness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say an empathy,</v>

217
00:11:31.711 --> 00:11:33.880
<v Speaker 1>is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

218
00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:39.070
<v Speaker 1>the empathetic identification tends to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make the person who's experiencing it </v>

219
00:11:39.391 --> 00:11:43.530
<v Speaker 1>feel immediately virtuous because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're on the side of the weaker party,</v>

220
00:11:43.531 --> 00:11:48.531
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's obviously some utility in </v>

221
00:11:48.531 --> 00:11:48.531
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not really.</v>

222
00:11:48.531 --> 00:11:52.410
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't come with a set of solutions </v>
<v Speaker 1>to complex problems.</v>

223
00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:57.860
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that agreeableness is a </v>

224
00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:59.020
<v Speaker 1>pretty good virtue for small units like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the family were egalitarianism.</v>

225
00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:04.070
<v Speaker 1>Distribution is of extreme importance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't seem to work very well at</v>

226
00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:06.940
<v Speaker 1>at higher levels of complexity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

227
00:12:06.941 --> 00:12:10.150
<v Speaker 1>it's conscientiousness predicts </v>
<v Speaker 1>workplace proficiency,</v>

228
00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:12.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the second best predictor predictor</v>

229
00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:17.460
<v Speaker 1>after ICU.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Agreeableness is actually somewhat </v>

230
00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:19.801
<v Speaker 1>negatively correlated and less and less </v>
<v Speaker 1>the domain has to do with direct </v>

231
00:12:19.801 --> 00:12:21.910
<v Speaker 1>personal care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I don't think agreeable to scales</v>

232
00:12:21.911 --> 00:12:26.911
<v Speaker 1>very well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why conscientiousness has to </v>

233
00:12:26.911 --> 00:12:26.911
<v Speaker 1>enter into the picture</v>

234
00:12:26.911 --> 00:12:29.250
<v Speaker 2>and that's very helpful motivator for </v>
<v Speaker 2>myself.</v>

235
00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:34.280
<v Speaker 2>I look at a problem on my approach tends</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be empathy for people who have been </v>

236
00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:38.520
<v Speaker 2>left out or have been who don't have the</v>
<v Speaker 2>right end of the dominance hierarchy.</v>

237
00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:44.170
<v Speaker 2>And for me it's a motivator to look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>actual solutions and problems and issues</v>

238
00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:47.010
<v Speaker 2>and there's a lot of real concrete </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that can be attacked,</v>

239
00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:52.280
<v Speaker 2>but if you don't attack them from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective that's morally </v>

240
00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:52.280
<v Speaker 2>condescending,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can actually get shit done.</v>

241
00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:52.970
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it also,</v>

242
00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:57.250
<v Speaker 1>it's also very helpful to increase the </v>
<v Speaker 1>resolution of the problem.</v>

243
00:12:57.251 --> 00:12:58.230
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

244
00:12:58.231 --> 00:13:01.870
<v Speaker 1>and to stop trying to solve every </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem with one with one brush stroke,</v>

245
00:13:01.871 --> 00:13:06.871
<v Speaker 1>most things are really complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So intelligent political discourse </v>

246
00:13:06.871 --> 00:13:09.790
<v Speaker 1>should involve decomposing a problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>like poverty,</v>

247
00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:14.940
<v Speaker 1>which isn't our problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a set of a thousand problems into </v>

248
00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:17.170
<v Speaker 1>each of those thousand problems and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to generate creative solutions to</v>

249
00:13:17.171 --> 00:13:21.310
<v Speaker 1>each of them and then to test them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the resolution of the,</v>

250
00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:26.370
<v Speaker 1>of the discussion has to be increased.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that you and I </v>

251
00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:27.160
<v Speaker 1>have talked about was the possibility </v>
<v Speaker 1>that these longer form,</v>

252
00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:29.490
<v Speaker 1>the longer form discourse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

253
00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:31.780
<v Speaker 1>avenues that are available on the new </v>
<v Speaker 1>media,</v>

254
00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:36.930
<v Speaker 1>like what we're doing right now might </v>
<v Speaker 1>enable us to identify and promote </v>

255
00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:38.800
<v Speaker 1>politicians who are capable of high </v>
<v Speaker 1>resolution discussion,</v>

256
00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:44.130
<v Speaker 1>who had the real solutions to real </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems instead of having to compress </v>

257
00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:44.230
<v Speaker 1>everything into a six second soundbite.</v>

258
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:49.790
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other thing that I'm finding really </v>

259
00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:51.471
<v Speaker 2>heartening is a lot of the candidates </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I am working with interacting with </v>

260
00:13:51.471 --> 00:13:55.290
<v Speaker 2>and at this point that's in the hundreds</v>
<v Speaker 2>are very focused on actual solutions.</v>

261
00:13:55.291 --> 00:13:57.750
<v Speaker 2>And I'm trying to get a handle on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

262
00:13:57.751 --> 00:14:00.390
<v Speaker 2>the cultural conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the hell that is,</v>

263
00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:05.810
<v Speaker 2>it benefits by blowing the extremes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it feels like that's almost all that </v>

264
00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:09.881
<v Speaker 2>we're hearing about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when I'm dealing with actual </v>

265
00:14:09.881 --> 00:14:12.330
<v Speaker 2>candidates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them are dealing with the anti </v>

266
00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:13.590
<v Speaker 2>corruption healthcare jobs and education</v>
<v Speaker 2>like are aware of that.</v>

267
00:14:13.591 --> 00:14:16.550
<v Speaker 2>That isn't the plan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's this amplifying the facts</v>

268
00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:21.980
<v Speaker 2>and then we have a lot of sort of like </v>
<v Speaker 2>this cultural conversation about the </v>

269
00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:25.770
<v Speaker 2>cultural conversation that things become</v>
<v Speaker 2>very kind of narrow and the level of the</v>

270
00:14:25.771 --> 00:14:28.680
<v Speaker 2>candidates are operating at the level </v>
<v Speaker 2>that people are.</v>

271
00:14:28.681 --> 00:14:29.180
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

272
00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:31.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm dealing a lot with candidates in </v>
<v Speaker 2>different states.</v>

273
00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:36.980
<v Speaker 2>People are having a hard time right now </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they need hardcore solutions and </v>

274
00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:40.251
<v Speaker 2>they actually don't give a shit about </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone on twitter and facebook who's </v>

275
00:14:40.251 --> 00:14:41.670
<v Speaker 2>preaching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every Mazda already unfriended them.</v>

276
00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:46.730
<v Speaker 2>They need solutions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They need a government that's </v>

277
00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:46.730
<v Speaker 2>functional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they need,</v>

278
00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:47.550
<v Speaker 2>they want more transparency and </v>
<v Speaker 2>microcorruption.</v>

279
00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:50.850
<v Speaker 2>There's a very common set of things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>govern people,</v>

280
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:56.110
<v Speaker 2>but there's this sort of amplified </v>
<v Speaker 2>effect from the extremes of the party </v>

281
00:14:56.110 --> 00:15:00.370
<v Speaker 2>that are gathering the the attention and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the biggest tool that we have in a </v>

282
00:15:00.831 --> 00:15:05.831
<v Speaker 2>democracy in some ways is our attention </v>
<v Speaker 2>and where we focus it and if that's </v>

283
00:15:05.831 --> 00:15:09.290
<v Speaker 2>being hijacked by know bullshit </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversations and Straw men.</v>

284
00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:13.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean I would love to engage with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with reasonable,</v>

285
00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Republicans,</v>

286
00:15:15.171 --> 00:15:18.500
<v Speaker 2>a lot of whom are my friends and all my </v>
<v Speaker 2>colleagues to say,</v>

287
00:15:18.501 --> 00:15:23.501
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know we can go and push everything to </v>

288
00:15:23.501 --> 00:15:23.501
<v Speaker 2>extremes and find in debate and score </v>
<v Speaker 2>points,</v>

289
00:15:23.501 --> 00:15:26.060
<v Speaker 2>but like you don't like some of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit anymore than I do.</v>

290
00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:29.210
<v Speaker 2>Like what's an actual conversation from </v>
<v Speaker 2>our different perspectives,</v>

291
00:15:29.211 --> 00:15:34.211
<v Speaker 2>assuming I don't have all the answers </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we can come up with certain </v>

292
00:15:34.211 --> 00:15:35.630
<v Speaker 2>solutions that's going to take care of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are not doing as well.</v>

293
00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:37.440
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are not doing as well.</v>

294
00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:40.700
<v Speaker 2>They're not keeping up with the economy </v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's not good for anybody.</v>

295
00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:44.870
<v Speaker 2>That's not a game that is iterable </v>
<v Speaker 2>across multiple genes in generations.</v>

296
00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:48.920
<v Speaker 2>If more and more people are starting to </v>
<v Speaker 2>see more and more not good for anybody,</v>

297
00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:54.010
<v Speaker 2>even the people at the top,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so how do we seek to kind of balance </v>

298
00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:55.080
<v Speaker 2>that out for people who don't have their</v>
<v Speaker 2>fair shot and during</v>

299
00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:58.230
<v Speaker 1>conservative perspective you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

300
00:15:58.231 --> 00:16:02.790
<v Speaker 1>how do we stabilize the hierarchy so the</v>
<v Speaker 1>tendency for or the multiple hierarchies</v>

301
00:16:02.791 --> 00:16:07.791
<v Speaker 1>for the tendency so that the tendency </v>
<v Speaker 1>for people to stack up at the bottom </v>

302
00:16:07.791 --> 00:16:11.841
<v Speaker 1>doesn't become so extreme that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire system starts to shake and </v>

303
00:16:11.841 --> 00:16:11.841
<v Speaker 1>tremble,</v>

304
00:16:11.841 --> 00:16:13.070
<v Speaker 2>which obviously isn't good for anyone at</v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

305
00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:15.020
<v Speaker 2>We're seeing a lot of shaking and </v>
<v Speaker 2>trembling.</v>

306
00:16:15.021 --> 00:16:20.021
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of people in the last </v>

307
00:16:20.021 --> 00:16:21.380
<v Speaker 2>election did not feel heard or seen or </v>
<v Speaker 2>represented in the choices of candidates</v>

308
00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:24.050
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care what it is.</v>

309
00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:26.330
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to be business as usual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

310
00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:28.880
<v Speaker 2>So the solution isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my estimation,</v>

311
00:16:28.881 --> 00:16:31.880
<v Speaker 2>to denigrate people who chose to vote </v>
<v Speaker 2>for president trump.</v>

312
00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:36.710
<v Speaker 2>I think the solution is to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that we need to do better.</v>

313
00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:42.100
<v Speaker 2>If we want to promote a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the Democrats want to promote a </v>

314
00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:45.341
<v Speaker 2>viable alternative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to do better with what our </v>

315
00:16:45.341 --> 00:16:47.681
<v Speaker 2>messaging is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to do better on messages that </v>

316
00:16:47.681 --> 00:16:47.681
<v Speaker 2>are anticorruption and we have to make a</v>
<v Speaker 2>better argument.</v>

317
00:16:47.681 --> 00:16:48.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the thing is,</v>

318
00:16:48.561 --> 00:16:53.561
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was on Bill Maher show a while back </v>

319
00:16:53.561 --> 00:16:56.051
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of the panelists on his show </v>
<v Speaker 1>really taking pot shots at the trump </v>

320
00:16:56.051 --> 00:16:57.250
<v Speaker 1>supporters and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

321
00:16:57.290 --> 00:17:01.160
<v Speaker 1>with the typical sort of pejorative </v>
<v Speaker 1>center label that are leveled at them.</v>

322
00:17:01.161 --> 00:17:06.161
<v Speaker 1>And I thought that was extremely </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous because they're basically </v>

323
00:17:06.161 --> 00:17:07.670
<v Speaker 1>dissing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say he was a terrible cliche about</v>

324
00:17:07.671 --> 00:17:12.671
<v Speaker 1>50 percent of the American population in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same percentage that's been voting </v>

325
00:17:12.671 --> 00:17:15.140
<v Speaker 1>Republican for about 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to just out of hand dismiss your,</v>

326
00:17:15.570 --> 00:17:17.220
<v Speaker 1>the people who are voting differently </v>
<v Speaker 1>than,</v>

327
00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:20.410
<v Speaker 1>than you as somehow primitive or </v>
<v Speaker 1>primordial or,</v>

328
00:17:20.411 --> 00:17:24.230
<v Speaker 1>or foolish or are ill advised is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very dangerous.</v>

329
00:17:24.231 --> 00:17:29.231
<v Speaker 1>And also more than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also an abdication of </v>

330
00:17:29.231 --> 00:17:32.501
<v Speaker 1>responsibility because the Republicans </v>
<v Speaker 1>might have won the last election or </v>

331
00:17:32.501 --> 00:17:37.221
<v Speaker 1>trump might have won the last election,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but certainly the democrats lost the </v>

332
00:17:37.221 --> 00:17:37.870
<v Speaker 1>last election.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I would,</v>

333
00:17:37.871 --> 00:17:42.871
<v Speaker 1>if I thought that their discourse would </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been a lot more productive if they </v>

334
00:17:42.871 --> 00:17:43.490
<v Speaker 1>would have focused on the failings of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Democratic Party,</v>

335
00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:48.730
<v Speaker 1>and that's also a lot more useful </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you can figure out why you </v>

336
00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:50.100
<v Speaker 1>didn't succeed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it very close election,</v>

337
00:17:50.101 --> 00:17:51.690
<v Speaker 1>if you can figure out what mistakes you </v>
<v Speaker 1>made,</v>

338
00:17:51.691 --> 00:17:52.830
<v Speaker 1>then you could rectify it.</v>

339
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:59.150
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly along the lines of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that you and I talked about at </v>

340
00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:00.290
<v Speaker 2>length,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is personal accountability.</v>

341
00:18:00.291 --> 00:18:05.291
<v Speaker 2>It's like you get in a fight with your </v>
<v Speaker 2>wife or your husband is the best thing </v>

342
00:18:05.291 --> 00:18:08.570
<v Speaker 2>to do to point out the 50 percent or 80 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent or 90 percent where they screwed</v>

343
00:18:08.571 --> 00:18:12.530
<v Speaker 2>up or to actually reflect and think </v>
<v Speaker 2>about whatever percent it is at whatever</v>

344
00:18:12.531 --> 00:18:15.950
<v Speaker 2>number that you can do something better </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's actually within your control.</v>

345
00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:19.100
<v Speaker 2>And so for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a scalable notion.</v>

346
00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:24.130
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have many friends too wide and varied </v>

347
00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:24.470
<v Speaker 2>and smart who voted for trump to dismiss</v>
<v Speaker 2>them all as idiots.</v>

348
00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:25.520
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a very,</v>

349
00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:28.130
<v Speaker 2>you can't denigrate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And plus we're married to them.</v>

350
00:18:28.131 --> 00:18:33.131
<v Speaker 2>That's $50.</v>
<v Speaker 2>40 nine point nine percent of our </v>

351
00:18:33.131 --> 00:18:36.131
<v Speaker 2>population,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are married to them and we have to </v>

352
00:18:36.131 --> 00:18:39.221
<v Speaker 2>figure out how to talk and to come up </v>
<v Speaker 2>with solutions that make sense and that </v>

353
00:18:39.221 --> 00:18:43.451
<v Speaker 2>everybody can and so for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of it is to look at what the </v>

354
00:18:43.451 --> 00:18:46.610
<v Speaker 2>impulse was that was underlying that and</v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out where Democrats can be better</v>

355
00:18:46.611 --> 00:18:51.611
<v Speaker 2>at seeing and hearing people and </v>
<v Speaker 2>furthering arguments in ways that feel </v>

356
00:18:51.611 --> 00:18:53.600
<v Speaker 2>with legitimate and connect with people </v>
<v Speaker 2>and figure out what the messaging is.</v>

357
00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:58.600
<v Speaker 2>So you always clean up your side of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>house first and it doesn't mean that </v>

358
00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:02.400
<v Speaker 2>there's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a number of policies that I'm </v>

359
00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.181
<v Speaker 2>highly critical of president trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't mean that identity great </v>

360
00:19:04.181 --> 00:19:07.840
<v Speaker 2>his followers or the people who voted </v>
<v Speaker 2>for him or that I will dismiss any </v>

361
00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:10.280
<v Speaker 2>tendencies that they might've had or </v>
<v Speaker 2>hesitations that they might've had about</v>

362
00:19:10.281 --> 00:19:11.080
<v Speaker 2>voting or otherwise.</v>

363
00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:13.500
<v Speaker 1>The right message should be something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

364
00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:17.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm not so much white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your opponent is worse,</v>

365
00:19:17.281 --> 00:19:20.520
<v Speaker 1>but by why you're better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why your solutions are better,</v>

366
00:19:20.521 --> 00:19:21.270
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why,</v>

367
00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:22.050
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

368
00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:24.060
<v Speaker 1>The grass is greener on your side of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fence.</v>

369
00:19:24.061 --> 00:19:29.061
<v Speaker 1>Why there's less corruption occurring </v>
<v Speaker 1>under your watch and and also marketing </v>

370
00:19:29.061 --> 00:19:32.430
<v Speaker 1>the fact that the solutions that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have are both reasonable and practical.</v>

371
00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:36.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean that does require more elevated </v>
<v Speaker 1>form of political discourse and it would</v>

372
00:19:36.511 --> 00:19:39.060
<v Speaker 1>be really nice if that could be </v>
<v Speaker 1>facilitated by these,</v>

373
00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:40.710
<v Speaker 1>by these long forms that are available.</v>

374
00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:46.440
<v Speaker 2>Hear the refrain all the time of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Democrats don't have a message that </v>

375
00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:48.600
<v Speaker 2>president trump is awful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is not a message and I'd been.</v>

376
00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:53.640
<v Speaker 2>I'd been really heartened with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversations that I'm having with </v>

377
00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:55.300
<v Speaker 2>candidates right now that there's a huge</v>
<v Speaker 2>focus on kitchen table issues.</v>

378
00:19:55.340 --> 00:20:00.340
<v Speaker 2>There's a huge focus on trying to tackle</v>
<v Speaker 2>health care and education to jobs in </v>

379
00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:04.411
<v Speaker 2>ways that are more innovative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you talk to the actual candidates </v>

380
00:20:04.411 --> 00:20:05.620
<v Speaker 2>who I want to start to pull it into more</v>
<v Speaker 2>and more conversations.</v>

381
00:20:05.621 --> 00:20:09.460
<v Speaker 2>I have an enormous amount of of optimism</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the other thing is,</v>

382
00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:14.900
<v Speaker 2>is your real money where your mouth is </v>
<v Speaker 2>stance against corruption and there is </v>

383
00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:18.601
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something called the disclose </v>

384
00:20:18.601 --> 00:20:19.150
<v Speaker 2>act that a lot of Democrats are working </v>
<v Speaker 2>on which is fully disclosing all of your</v>

385
00:20:19.151 --> 00:20:20.350
<v Speaker 2>donors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

386
00:20:20.351 --> 00:20:25.351
<v Speaker 2>releasing taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm taking a pledge against no dark </v>

387
00:20:25.351 --> 00:20:25.351
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

388
00:20:25.351 --> 00:20:26.440
<v Speaker 2>There's a whole number of different </v>
<v Speaker 2>resolutions,</v>

389
00:20:26.441 --> 00:20:31.441
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fighting voter suppression and that </v>

390
00:20:31.441 --> 00:20:33.781
<v Speaker 2>means whether we lose or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not about fighting voter </v>

391
00:20:33.781 --> 00:20:36.511
<v Speaker 2>suppression to sort of tell the vote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like we need the right to win </v>

392
00:20:36.511 --> 00:20:41.131
<v Speaker 2>elections or lose elections fairly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so there's a lot of positions that </v>

393
00:20:41.131 --> 00:20:43.440
<v Speaker 2>are being put forth right now that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel are really heartening,</v>

394
00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:47.650
<v Speaker 2>including a very strong anticorruption </v>
<v Speaker 2>stance because you can't.</v>

395
00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:52.710
<v Speaker 2>You have to clean up what your site is </v>
<v Speaker 2>and in this wave of candidates and I'm </v>

396
00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:56.401
<v Speaker 2>looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been really impressive to me how </v>

397
00:20:56.401 --> 00:20:58.240
<v Speaker 2>they're starting to further and </v>
<v Speaker 2>articulate what the,</v>

398
00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:03.720
<v Speaker 2>what the argument can be from that side </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's what we can also </v>

399
00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:05.110
<v Speaker 2>start to find common ground to talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the corruption.</v>

400
00:21:05.111 --> 00:21:10.111
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a lot of republicans who </v>
<v Speaker 2>are enthralled with the level of </v>

401
00:21:10.111 --> 00:21:10.111
<v Speaker 2>discourse right now.</v>

402
00:21:10.111 --> 00:21:13.970
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that struck me when </v>

403
00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:15.881
<v Speaker 1>I've been talking to you lately is we've</v>
<v Speaker 1>been talking about what happened with </v>

404
00:21:15.881 --> 00:21:17.840
<v Speaker 1>the Democratic Party is also the idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the radicals,</v>

405
00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:22.870
<v Speaker 1>the identity politics types managed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>take over the narrative to a large </v>

406
00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:26.711
<v Speaker 1>degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because the extremism is more </v>

407
00:21:26.711 --> 00:21:28.931
<v Speaker 1>attractive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say among a dying mainstream </v>

408
00:21:28.931 --> 00:21:28.931
<v Speaker 1>media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's click,</v>

409
00:21:28.931 --> 00:21:32.540
<v Speaker 1>baity and and easy to attract attention </v>
<v Speaker 1>to and loud and and cinematic and all of</v>

410
00:21:32.541 --> 00:21:37.541
<v Speaker 1>those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also that the centrist Democrats </v>

411
00:21:37.541 --> 00:21:40.370
<v Speaker 1>seem to have lost faith in their central</v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative or perhaps have failed to,</v>

412
00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:45.460
<v Speaker 1>to produce one over the last 15 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that left a void into which the </v>

413
00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.630
<v Speaker 1>extremist narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the oppressor,</v>

414
00:21:47.631 --> 00:21:49.790
<v Speaker 1>oppressive oppressor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oppression,</v>

415
00:21:49.791 --> 00:21:50.660
<v Speaker 1>narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

416
00:21:50.661 --> 00:21:55.661
<v Speaker 1>or or pressure victim narrative has been</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to slide in and dominate because of</v>

417
00:21:55.851 --> 00:22:00.851
<v Speaker 1>that void.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's another thing that needs </v>

418
00:22:00.851 --> 00:22:03.191
<v Speaker 1>to be seriously addressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the center has lost its </v>

419
00:22:03.191 --> 00:22:03.191
<v Speaker 1>narrative and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

420
00:22:03.191 --> 00:22:04.760
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's something I'd like to see the</v>

421
00:22:04.761 --> 00:22:07.950
<v Speaker 1>Democrats a deal with now in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

422
00:22:07.951 --> 00:22:10.850
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the first ad that you generate it.</v>

423
00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:13.430
<v Speaker 1>You had a farmer talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>

424
00:22:13.431 --> 00:22:18.431
<v Speaker 1>you had a farmer talk about success and </v>
<v Speaker 1>about what that might mean if you could </v>

425
00:22:18.431 --> 00:22:18.431
<v Speaker 1>obtain it individually.</v>

426
00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:23.850
<v Speaker 2>I think where we have fallen down as </v>
<v Speaker 2>Democrats and and where we are now </v>

427
00:22:24.101 --> 00:22:25.520
<v Speaker 2>reorienting is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

428
00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:27.880
<v Speaker 2>is the discussion of aspirational </v>
<v Speaker 2>values,</v>

429
00:22:27.881 --> 00:22:32.881
<v Speaker 2>meaning is it a rigged game?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we can absolutely point to things </v>

430
00:22:32.881 --> 00:22:33.370
<v Speaker 2>that are disadvantages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

431
00:22:33.371 --> 00:22:35.230
<v Speaker 2>but to say it's a rigged game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a regained.</v>

432
00:22:35.231 --> 00:22:39.130
<v Speaker 2>The thing that we have to say is all </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we're in favor of our fair rules at</v>

433
00:22:39.131 --> 00:22:42.130
<v Speaker 2>the starting gate and if you work </v>
<v Speaker 2>harder,</v>

434
00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:45.760
<v Speaker 2>if you're an innovator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you bust your ass good on you,</v>

435
00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:47.950
<v Speaker 2>like go buy a mansion in three cars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

436
00:22:47.951 --> 00:22:52.951
<v Speaker 2>go start a second business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to be rewarding of success and </v>

437
00:22:52.951 --> 00:22:54.280
<v Speaker 2>speaking to people's aspirations and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

438
00:22:54.281 --> 00:22:59.281
<v Speaker 2>we talk a lot about income inequality </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the problem with that is what's the </v>

439
00:22:59.281 --> 00:22:59.530
<v Speaker 2>opposite of that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is income equality.</v>

440
00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:00.850
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody wants that.</v>

441
00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:05.940
<v Speaker 2>If you look at the average salaries and </v>
<v Speaker 2>incomes of people in the Senate and </v>

442
00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:06.430
<v Speaker 2>Congress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing just fine.</v>

443
00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:08.440
<v Speaker 2>They don't want that either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so for me,</v>

444
00:23:08.441 --> 00:23:13.441
<v Speaker 2>I think it's much more powerful to talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about income injustice because it means </v>

445
00:23:13.441 --> 00:23:17.341
<v Speaker 2>that people have a fair shot at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>starting gate and then they can </v>

446
00:23:17.341 --> 00:23:20.821
<v Speaker 2>differentiate themselves by their own </v>
<v Speaker 2>abilities and their own willingness to </v>

447
00:23:20.821 --> 00:23:24.931
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for me it's about the starting gate </v>

448
00:23:24.931 --> 00:23:24.931
<v Speaker 2>and making sure that we look at things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are there.</v>

449
00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:27.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well and also that the emphasis that you</v>

450
00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:32.970
<v Speaker 1>placed on rewarding actual achievement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We also have to be in a situation where </v>

451
00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:37.021
<v Speaker 1>we can admit that at least one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>factors that differentiates people as </v>

452
00:23:37.021 --> 00:23:40.771
<v Speaker 1>they move up competence hierarchies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we have to admit that some of the </v>

453
00:23:40.771 --> 00:23:44.851
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies that exist are actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>based on competence and not merely on </v>

454
00:23:44.851 --> 00:23:45.890
<v Speaker 1>oppression is the amount of effort they </v>
<v Speaker 1>into things.</v>

455
00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:47.680
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's become.</v>

456
00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:52.710
<v Speaker 1>That's become an anastomotic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a proposition on many university </v>

457
00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:54.380
<v Speaker 1>campuses where you're not allowed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

458
00:23:54.381 --> 00:23:58.550
<v Speaker 1>to state that hard work because at some </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the people who have made it,</v>

459
00:23:58.850 --> 00:24:03.850
<v Speaker 1>have done a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>done it as a consequence of working </v>

460
00:24:03.850 --> 00:24:06.041
<v Speaker 1>extra hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I guess that undermines the </v>

461
00:24:06.041 --> 00:24:08.651
<v Speaker 1>narrative that the whole game is rigged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the truth of the matter is the game </v>

462
00:24:08.651 --> 00:24:10.490
<v Speaker 1>is partly raped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all games always are,</v>

463
00:24:10.491 --> 00:24:15.491
<v Speaker 1>and that is unfortunate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't throw the whole damn game </v>

464
00:24:15.491 --> 00:24:18.771
<v Speaker 1>mode because it's partly rigged just </v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you think you can put in place a </v>

465
00:24:18.771 --> 00:24:19.700
<v Speaker 1>game that isn't going to be rigged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And good luck with that.</v>

466
00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:20.040
<v Speaker 1>It's</v>

467
00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:25.750
<v Speaker 2>here's very interesting interview </v>
<v Speaker 2>between Weinstein and bench purell on </v>

468
00:24:25.981 --> 00:24:30.981
<v Speaker 2>the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's so interesting is there from </v>

469
00:24:30.981 --> 00:24:30.981
<v Speaker 2>completely opposite sides of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>spectrum.</v>

470
00:24:30.981 --> 00:24:32.280
<v Speaker 2>I think it doesn't hurt to find himself </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a socialist.</v>

471
00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:33.960
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's certainly on the left.</v>

472
00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:35.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean so,</v>

473
00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:37.500
<v Speaker 2>but you have them discussed and it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

474
00:24:37.501 --> 00:24:42.501
<v Speaker 2>very civil discourse and I think eric </v>
<v Speaker 2>can do a much better job than I can of </v>

475
00:24:42.501 --> 00:24:46.311
<v Speaker 2>discussing the ways in which the issue </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't that there is a dominance </v>

476
00:24:46.311 --> 00:24:48.330
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy and the people differentiate </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves based on their hard work.</v>

477
00:24:48.331 --> 00:24:53.331
<v Speaker 2>The issue is sort of what we've seen </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the separation of the working </v>

478
00:24:53.331 --> 00:24:53.350
<v Speaker 2>class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

479
00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:58.360
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he points to a lot of trends about </v>

480
00:24:58.360 --> 00:24:59.100
<v Speaker 2>what's happened with workers' wages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a ceo a few seconds ago,</v>

481
00:24:59.101 --> 00:25:01.710
<v Speaker 2>made three times the average worker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's a $300.</v>

482
00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:07.050
<v Speaker 2>It's not about overall people doing well</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there's an increasing exponential </v>

483
00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:07.620
<v Speaker 2>separation between,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

484
00:25:07.621 --> 00:25:12.621
<v Speaker 2>working people and people who are at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>top and I think that's the skew that's </v>

485
00:25:12.621 --> 00:25:17.211
<v Speaker 2>problematic and the fact of the matter </v>
<v Speaker 2>is rather than pushing away and you </v>

486
00:25:17.401 --> 00:25:19.380
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could talk a little bit also about,</v>

487
00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:22.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conservatives like Ben,</v>

488
00:25:22.051 --> 00:25:27.051
<v Speaker 2>but rather than sort of denigrating it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of good brains on both </v>

489
00:25:27.051 --> 00:25:30.620
<v Speaker 2>sides of the fence and like wouldn't it </v>
<v Speaker 2>be absolutely lovely if we have </v>

490
00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:33.951
<v Speaker 2>reasonable conversations about what we </v>
<v Speaker 2>all want to do about that rather than </v>

491
00:25:33.951 --> 00:25:38.551
<v Speaker 2>the physician having to be income </v>
<v Speaker 2>equality versus only self reliance and </v>

492
00:25:38.651 --> 00:25:41.370
<v Speaker 2>play yourself up by your bootstraps </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's some people who can't do</v>

493
00:25:41.371 --> 00:25:41.580
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

494
00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:44.970
<v Speaker 2>There are some fundamental problems with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the system,</v>

495
00:25:44.971 --> 00:25:49.971
<v Speaker 2>this leading to people having a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>harder time and everyone agrees with </v>

496
00:25:49.971 --> 00:25:51.060
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if we can talk about the details,</v>

497
00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:56.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of like when we talk about </v>

498
00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:56.240
<v Speaker 2>universal healthcare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like you come in the door and the</v>

499
00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:57.180
<v Speaker 2>minute you say it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are for and against.</v>

500
00:25:57.630 --> 00:26:02.630
<v Speaker 2>And for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of other arguments to </v>

501
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:02.630
<v Speaker 2>make.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

502
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:04.821
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we already have universal healthcare in </v>

503
00:26:04.821 --> 00:26:04.821
<v Speaker 2>this country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called emergency rooms.</v>

504
00:26:04.821 --> 00:26:07.200
<v Speaker 2>It's UNAMERICAN and wrong to let people </v>
<v Speaker 2>die on the streets.</v>

505
00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:10.020
<v Speaker 2>We don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if people are uninsured,</v>

506
00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:15.200
<v Speaker 2>the hospital passes on the costs of </v>
<v Speaker 2>insurance companies who raise our </v>

507
00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:15.960
<v Speaker 2>premiums.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the average cost of an emergency room</v>

508
00:26:15.961 --> 00:26:19.110
<v Speaker 2>visit in the United States is 1000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>$233.</v>

509
00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:21.810
<v Speaker 2>The average cost of a vaccination is </v>
<v Speaker 2>$19.</v>

510
00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:26.900
<v Speaker 2>We're all paying for it anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's also a lot less risk of </v>

511
00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:27.630
<v Speaker 2>public health hazards and other things.</v>

512
00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:32.630
<v Speaker 2>If we can figure out a way to come up </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a medical system that people are </v>

513
00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:36.321
<v Speaker 2>getting the care that they want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Preventive care is infinitely cheaper </v>

514
00:26:36.321 --> 00:26:36.810
<v Speaker 2>than trying to play catch up in </v>
<v Speaker 2>emergency rooms.</v>

515
00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:39.660
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't just walk in the door </v>
<v Speaker 2>and say,</v>

516
00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:44.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm for universal healthcare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm opposed to universal healthcare </v>

517
00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:44.720
<v Speaker 2>because a lot of say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

518
00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:46.460
<v Speaker 2>I was out of work and having a hard time</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I had to feed.</v>

519
00:26:46.461 --> 00:26:51.461
<v Speaker 2>You are paying my own healthcare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to frame it in a way of saying </v>

520
00:26:51.461 --> 00:26:54.680
<v Speaker 2>this is good for the robustness of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole community and I think there's a </v>

521
00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:56.760
<v Speaker 2>lot of arguments and discussions are </v>
<v Speaker 2>from both sides that we need.</v>

522
00:26:56.790 --> 00:27:01.790
<v Speaker 2>We need all those brains pulling </v>
<v Speaker 2>together and it's one of the things is </v>

523
00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:05.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm watching a lot of new stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would love to see increasingly </v>

524
00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:08.530
<v Speaker 2>increasing conversations like the one </v>
<v Speaker 2>that Eric and Ben had where their stupid</v>

525
00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:13.580
<v Speaker 2>from the opposite side who are engaging </v>
<v Speaker 2>very reasonably and seeing each other's </v>

526
00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:17.751
<v Speaker 2>points and trying to figure out what </v>
<v Speaker 2>skills they can bring from the </v>

527
00:27:17.751 --> 00:27:18.030
<v Speaker 2>respective sides of the proverbial </v>
<v Speaker 2>aisle.</v>

528
00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:23.630
<v Speaker 1>So you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think you see within the Democratic </v>

529
00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:27.140
<v Speaker 1>Party in an attempt at least to increase</v>
<v Speaker 1>the resolution of the discussion and to </v>

530
00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:28.450
<v Speaker 1>move away from the more polarizing </v>
<v Speaker 1>discourse you see that</v>

531
00:27:28.550 --> 00:27:30.470
<v Speaker 2>starting to develop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

532
00:27:30.471 --> 00:27:35.471
<v Speaker 2>So tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell me some of those concrete things </v>

533
00:27:35.471 --> 00:27:35.471
<v Speaker 2>you've seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

534
00:27:35.471 --> 00:27:35.471
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

535
00:27:35.471 --> 00:27:37.250
<v Speaker 2>I've been meeting with a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>candidates.</v>

536
00:27:37.251 --> 00:27:42.251
<v Speaker 2>I found there there's a candidate who I </v>
<v Speaker 2>really liked called Joseph Kopser is </v>

537
00:27:42.251 --> 00:27:44.680
<v Speaker 2>running in tax this who's a 20 year in </v>
<v Speaker 2>armies ranger,</v>

538
00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:48.230
<v Speaker 2>I believe he is a bronze star.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a graduate of Harvard.</v>

539
00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:53.260
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy school is a professor at West </v>
<v Speaker 2>Point and what was amazing with him is </v>

540
00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:54.210
<v Speaker 2>like he was talking about universal </v>
<v Speaker 2>healthcare.</v>

541
00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:59.230
<v Speaker 2>He started his own business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a private business that led to tons of </v>

542
00:27:59.230 --> 00:28:02.771
<v Speaker 2>jobs and he's just incredible person and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he made an argument in a way I haven't </v>

543
00:28:02.771 --> 00:28:03.860
<v Speaker 2>ever thought about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's talking about healthcare.</v>

544
00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:04.610
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

545
00:28:04.611 --> 00:28:07.340
<v Speaker 2>I have my healthcare from the army for </v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

546
00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:12.770
<v Speaker 2>That allowed me to take a risk and go </v>
<v Speaker 2>out entrepreneurially to start a company</v>

547
00:28:12.771 --> 00:28:14.660
<v Speaker 2>that then led to tons and tons of time.</v>

548
00:28:15.050 --> 00:28:15.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

549
00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:20.750
<v Speaker 1>there's evidence in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our rate of entrepreneurial development </v>

550
00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:21.840
<v Speaker 1>in Canada per capita,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually slightly higher than it is</v>

551
00:28:21.841 --> 00:28:26.841
<v Speaker 1>in the US and analysis has indicated </v>
<v Speaker 1>that one of the reasons for that is the </v>

552
00:28:26.841 --> 00:28:30.180
<v Speaker 1>provision of universal health care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People can take entrepreneurial risks in</v>

553
00:28:30.181 --> 00:28:33.180
<v Speaker 1>Canada without losing their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their fundamental safety net.</v>

554
00:28:33.181 --> 00:28:37.920
<v Speaker 1>So you can make a conservative argument </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the provision of a certain level of,</v>

555
00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:39.930
<v Speaker 1>of underlying security,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say</v>

556
00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:43.390
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a great argument for me.</v>

557
00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:48.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean the other thing is I'm seeing a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of candidates who are Democrats who </v>

558
00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:50.770
<v Speaker 2>were very upfront with their support for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the second amendment and it's like,</v>

559
00:28:50.771 --> 00:28:53.440
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the second amendment is an amendment.</v>

560
00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:57.100
<v Speaker 2>You can't just get rid of an amendment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I know that as a classical liberal,</v>

561
00:28:57.101 --> 00:28:59.410
<v Speaker 2>when people come after freedom of </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech,</v>

562
00:28:59.710 --> 00:29:01.430
<v Speaker 2>I get really pissed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

563
00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:03.370
<v Speaker 2>And people who were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who were,</v>

564
00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:08.380
<v Speaker 2>who were living in different regions in </v>
<v Speaker 2>different states that have different </v>

565
00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:11.341
<v Speaker 2>cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When they hear people start to attack </v>

566
00:29:11.341 --> 00:29:11.341
<v Speaker 2>the second amendment or or when it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>global,</v>

567
00:29:11.341 --> 00:29:16.111
<v Speaker 2>where it's all or nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there is an inherent threat that </v>

568
00:29:16.111 --> 00:29:17.240
<v Speaker 2>comes with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of it for me is to look at and</v>

569
00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:17.680
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

570
00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:21.270
<v Speaker 2>every amendment has certain limitations </v>
<v Speaker 2>on us.</v>

571
00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:23.770
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can't stand up on an airplane and</v>

572
00:29:23.771 --> 00:29:24.640
<v Speaker 2>scream that you have a ball.</v>

573
00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:29.670
<v Speaker 2>You can't threaten the president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>United States that you're going to kill </v>

574
00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:29.670
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first amendment.</v>

575
00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:31.960
<v Speaker 2>We have parameters around it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We already have them in place around the</v>

576
00:29:31.961 --> 00:29:34.300
<v Speaker 2>second amendment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody knows you can't own a bazooka.</v>

577
00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:36.370
<v Speaker 2>Everyone knows you can't own a dirty </v>
<v Speaker 2>bomb.</v>

578
00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:40.750
<v Speaker 2>So instead of coming in and sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>frightened people in their way of life,</v>

579
00:29:40.751 --> 00:29:42.340
<v Speaker 2>if they handguns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're hunting,</v>

580
00:29:42.341 --> 00:29:47.341
<v Speaker 2>if they are weapons collectors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we can boil the resolution down to </v>

581
00:29:47.341 --> 00:29:51.661
<v Speaker 2>say we're already having every amendment</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have or the first and second </v>

582
00:29:51.661 --> 00:29:55.261
<v Speaker 2>amendment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have certain limitations that we've </v>

583
00:29:55.261 --> 00:29:57.261
<v Speaker 2>placed on it for the community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how about if we just talk about </v>

584
00:29:57.261 --> 00:29:59.770
<v Speaker 2>violent history checks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's just talk about that one piece.</v>

585
00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:04.060
<v Speaker 2>So 90 percent of Americans are in favor </v>
<v Speaker 2>of that in 73 percent of the NRA.</v>

586
00:30:04.650 --> 00:30:06.730
<v Speaker 2>And so to have a candidate stand up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

587
00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:09.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love the First Amendment,</v>

588
00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:11.170
<v Speaker 2>I fully support the second amendment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Believe me,</v>

589
00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:12.790
<v Speaker 2>I've a lot of friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your Army Rangers,</v>

590
00:30:12.791 --> 00:30:17.791
<v Speaker 2>Green Berets and seals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that cultural wealth and rather </v>

591
00:30:17.791 --> 00:30:19.780
<v Speaker 2>than having some sort of frontal attack </v>
<v Speaker 2>on it to sort of say,</v>

592
00:30:19.781 --> 00:30:21.940
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's reasonable if you can't yell fire</v>

593
00:30:21.941 --> 00:30:26.941
<v Speaker 2>in a crowded theater?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about if we only discussed that and </v>

594
00:30:26.941 --> 00:30:28.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm standing with 90 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Americans in 73 percent of NRA members?</v>

595
00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:33.370
<v Speaker 2>It's a much more respectful conversation</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's a much more solution based.</v>

596
00:30:33.850 --> 00:30:35.290
<v Speaker 2>Also a humble,</v>
<v Speaker 2>humble or</v>

597
00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:40.510
<v Speaker 1>appreciation because it it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it requires a certain amount of </v>

598
00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:41.870
<v Speaker 1>appreciation for incremental change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

599
00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:47.430
<v Speaker 1>You will very ego inflating to do a </v>
<v Speaker 1>great thing to make a massive change and</v>

600
00:30:49.221 --> 00:30:51.950
<v Speaker 1>much less so to work in the background </v>
<v Speaker 1>to make a small change,</v>

601
00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:57.280
<v Speaker 1>but small changes are solid and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>tend not to produce terrible negative </v>

602
00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:01.661
<v Speaker 1>consequences and to and to work </v>
<v Speaker 1>incrementally is to work realistically </v>

603
00:31:02.361 --> 00:31:05.280
<v Speaker 1>and properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would also say meaningfully and,</v>

604
00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:10.900
<v Speaker 1>and that that's another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's another element that needs to be </v>

605
00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:11.330
<v Speaker 1>introduced back into the discourse is </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

606
00:31:11.331 --> 00:31:13.040
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't we,</v>

607
00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:18.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people who established the American </v>

608
00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:21.580
<v Speaker 1>American system where incrementalists </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally and they knew perfectly </v>

609
00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:25.901
<v Speaker 1>well that we had a flawed system that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was always going to be flawed in the </v>

610
00:31:25.901 --> 00:31:26.900
<v Speaker 1>best we could do is tinker away out </v>
<v Speaker 1>incrementally.</v>

611
00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:30.200
<v Speaker 1>And that's a really lovely sentiment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's very,</v>

612
00:31:30.530 --> 00:31:34.130
<v Speaker 1>it's very mature and wise to understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>that what you're working on,</v>

613
00:31:34.131 --> 00:31:34.940
<v Speaker 1>it's like a highway.</v>

614
00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:39.940
<v Speaker 1>It always needs repair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's always going to be construction </v>

615
00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:42.451
<v Speaker 1>on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's always going to be blockages on </v>

616
00:31:42.451 --> 00:31:42.451
<v Speaker 1>it because it needs to be maintained and</v>
<v Speaker 1>updated.</v>

617
00:31:42.451 --> 00:31:42.710
<v Speaker 1>But you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>

618
00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:45.170
<v Speaker 1>you don't scrap the whole thing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>every move.</v>

619
00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:50.560
<v Speaker 1>And part of the problem with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>discourse now too is that every issue </v>

620
00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:52.130
<v Speaker 1>becomes code for an ideological </v>
<v Speaker 1>position.</v>

621
00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:54.750
<v Speaker 1>Like I have a real hard time with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

622
00:31:55.190 --> 00:32:00.190
<v Speaker 1>all the environmentalist noise that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>hear on mainstream media in particular </v>

623
00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:03.470
<v Speaker 1>because I always see it as code for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very fundamental anticapitalist ethos.</v>

624
00:32:03.650 --> 00:32:08.650
<v Speaker 1>And so I can't separate the wheat from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the chaff mean I know because I've read </v>

625
00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:12.170
<v Speaker 1>a lot about ecological issues that there</v>
<v Speaker 1>are foolish things that people are doing</v>

626
00:32:12.171 --> 00:32:15.950
<v Speaker 1>in the world for a variety of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like overfishing is a real catastrophe.</v>

627
00:32:15.951 --> 00:32:19.400
<v Speaker 1>And it was so as deep ocean trolley as </v>
<v Speaker 1>far as I'm concerned.</v>

628
00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:22.940
<v Speaker 1>But when I read general environmentalist</v>
<v Speaker 1>claims,</v>

629
00:32:22.941 --> 00:32:27.941
<v Speaker 1>and these include climate change claims,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't separate it from a fundamental </v>

630
00:32:27.941 --> 00:32:29.660
<v Speaker 1>anticapitalist ethos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I can't decide,</v>

631
00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:31.570
<v Speaker 1>I can never decide whether I can trust </v>
<v Speaker 1>the</v>

632
00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:37.220
<v Speaker 2>underlined to that man is bad in New </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jersey,</v>

633
00:32:37.450 --> 00:32:40.700
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not a rallying cry to say,</v>

634
00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:45.730
<v Speaker 2>let me pitch original sin to you just to</v>
<v Speaker 2>say what are short term effective gains </v>

635
00:32:46.041 --> 00:32:51.041
<v Speaker 2>that can be made in additional middle </v>
<v Speaker 2>and longterm in business for clean </v>

636
00:32:51.041 --> 00:32:52.700
<v Speaker 2>rivers and clean oceans and for fishing </v>
<v Speaker 2>industries.</v>

637
00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:58.030
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also to talk about the things we've </v>

638
00:32:58.030 --> 00:32:58.030
<v Speaker 2>accomplished.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

639
00:32:58.030 --> 00:32:59.450
<v Speaker 2>we closed the ozone hole and companies </v>
<v Speaker 2>did business.</v>

640
00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:02.030
<v Speaker 2>There are actually solutions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

641
00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:02.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've,</v>

642
00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:05.870
<v Speaker 2>we've basically eliminated polio from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the face of the earth.</v>

643
00:33:05.871 --> 00:33:10.871
<v Speaker 2>There's entrepreneurial and innovative </v>
<v Speaker 2>solutions for things that can also be </v>

644
00:33:10.871 --> 00:33:13.760
<v Speaker 2>pro business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've reforested northern hemisphere,</v>

645
00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:18.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's more forest in the northern </v>

646
00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:18.820
<v Speaker 2>hemisphere then there was 100 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you said this thing about,</v>

647
00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:23.560
<v Speaker 2>about incremental change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's another thing I've been </v>

648
00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:26.351
<v Speaker 2>thinking about a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is when we walk in the door and </v>

649
00:33:26.351 --> 00:33:26.351
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm for gun control,</v>

650
00:33:26.351 --> 00:33:28.860
<v Speaker 2>or I'm prolife in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

651
00:33:28.861 --> 00:33:30.920
<v Speaker 2>in every circumstance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

652
00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:31.970
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

653
00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:35.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to come in with an absolute position.</v>

654
00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:41.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm one of the things that's really </v>
<v Speaker 2>tricky is if you're not willing to have </v>

655
00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:42.110
<v Speaker 2>a conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're not willing to see grounds,</v>

656
00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:46.010
<v Speaker 2>there was no terms under which you feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the,</v>

657
00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:51.140
<v Speaker 2>the negotiation or compromise can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>satisfied and that gets really </v>

658
00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:55.541
<v Speaker 2>dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's funny because it's something </v>

659
00:33:55.541 --> 00:33:57.431
<v Speaker 2>that I always advocate for when people </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about sort of a broad sweeping </v>

660
00:33:57.431 --> 00:34:01.520
<v Speaker 2>systemic problem or justice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is it doesn't boil it down.</v>

661
00:34:01.521 --> 00:34:06.521
<v Speaker 2>A level of resolution that you can get </v>
<v Speaker 2>traction from all the people that you </v>

662
00:34:06.521 --> 00:34:06.521
<v Speaker 2>need because people feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

663
00:34:06.521 --> 00:34:08.510
<v Speaker 2>what's the solution?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The solution is to throw everything away</v>

664
00:34:08.511 --> 00:34:10.850
<v Speaker 2>positive and negative and change </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

665
00:34:10.851 --> 00:34:12.740
<v Speaker 2>They're not going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's a problem.</v>

666
00:34:12.741 --> 00:34:15.410
<v Speaker 2>We solve the occupy Wall Street.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

667
00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:20.590
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it sort of spread from generalized </v>

668
00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:23.951
<v Speaker 2>corruption.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And incidentally they were targeting </v>

669
00:34:23.951 --> 00:34:26.651
<v Speaker 2>sort of the banks and the bigger systems</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost more than they were the </v>

670
00:34:26.651 --> 00:34:27.230
<v Speaker 2>government who was allowing a lot of it.</v>

671
00:34:27.650 --> 00:34:30.590
<v Speaker 2>But then as it kept rolling in issue </v>
<v Speaker 2>after issue after issue,</v>

672
00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:32.690
<v Speaker 2>it starts to get very complex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

673
00:34:32.691 --> 00:34:34.640
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we can see it and make changes,</v>

674
00:34:34.670 --> 00:34:36.800
<v Speaker 2>are there any terms under which you will</v>
<v Speaker 2>be satisfied?</v>

675
00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:38.120
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

676
00:34:38.170 --> 00:34:43.170
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the aspects of coming in </v>
<v Speaker 2>on positions of like for Oregon to </v>

677
00:34:43.170 --> 00:34:44.630
<v Speaker 2>universal health care for or against the</v>
<v Speaker 2>second amendment.</v>

678
00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:50.200
<v Speaker 2>There's no ground to be had there </v>
<v Speaker 2>because everyone's is digging in their </v>

679
00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:53.261
<v Speaker 2>heels and I feel like it's also a bit of</v>
<v Speaker 2>a product of a social media and the fact</v>

680
00:34:53.571 --> 00:34:55.450
<v Speaker 2>that we've all been sort of infants </v>
<v Speaker 2>allies,</v>

681
00:34:55.490 --> 00:35:00.490
<v Speaker 2>just sort of these lights and dobutamine</v>
<v Speaker 2>hits that keep driving virtue signaling </v>

682
00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:02.450
<v Speaker 2>and that goes for both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it goes for both sides.</v>

683
00:35:02.451 --> 00:35:04.910
<v Speaker 2>If you can get a real slam or digging on</v>
<v Speaker 2>your opponent,</v>

684
00:35:04.911 --> 00:35:06.280
<v Speaker 2>the good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And meanwhile,</v>

685
00:35:06.290 --> 00:35:08.660
<v Speaker 2>in the middle there's a ton of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Americans.</v>

686
00:35:08.661 --> 00:35:10.440
<v Speaker 2>There's a ton of kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

687
00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:12.980
<v Speaker 2>in education systems that need real </v>
<v Speaker 2>solutions.</v>

688
00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:18.040
<v Speaker 2>And it doesn't matter how much we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>signaling what our beliefs are in our </v>

689
00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:19.500
<v Speaker 2>respective balls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't come down to a real solution.</v>

690
00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:22.970
<v Speaker 2>It's also much more difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 2>generate real solutions because it means</v>

691
00:35:22.971 --> 00:35:24.890
<v Speaker 2>you actually have to have some domain </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge.</v>

692
00:35:24.891 --> 00:35:26.930
<v Speaker 2>And it isn't obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

693
00:35:26.931 --> 00:35:31.931
<v Speaker 2>that the classic forms of media that </v>
<v Speaker 2>politicians have used to interact with </v>

694
00:35:33.651 --> 00:35:38.651
<v Speaker 2>the populace have rewarded high </v>
<v Speaker 2>resolution knowledge know because it </v>

695
00:35:38.651 --> 00:35:38.651
<v Speaker 2>becomes,</v>

696
00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:43.880
<v Speaker 1>well it's easy for it to get tangled up </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the details for that kind of </v>

697
00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:44.100
<v Speaker 1>discussion to get tangled up in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>details.</v>

698
00:35:44.101 --> 00:35:49.101
<v Speaker 1>But these longer form conversations </v>
<v Speaker 1>might allow people to unpack some of </v>

699
00:35:49.101 --> 00:35:49.440
<v Speaker 1>that in a more intelligent way.</v>

700
00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:54.800
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a great discussion between Dave </v>

701
00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:58.770
<v Speaker 2>and Ben Shapiro at one point talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about abortion and they're on opposite </v>

702
00:35:58.770 --> 00:36:02.821
<v Speaker 2>sides of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what was really interesting was it </v>

703
00:36:02.821 --> 00:36:03.670
<v Speaker 2>was civil and there was no denigration </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the opposing side.</v>

704
00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:05.440
<v Speaker 2>Also we're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

705
00:36:05.441 --> 00:36:10.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't have an exact answer of when for</v>
<v Speaker 2>me it becomes uncomfortable.</v>

706
00:36:10.271 --> 00:36:15.271
<v Speaker 2>Like there is some point that did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It moves from something that is into a </v>

707
00:36:15.971 --> 00:36:17.500
<v Speaker 2>point that he's not comfortable with </v>
<v Speaker 2>abortion.</v>

708
00:36:17.501 --> 00:36:21.200
<v Speaker 2>There's a certain date that that would </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen or certain point in trimesters.</v>

709
00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:22.480
<v Speaker 2>And so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

710
00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:24.040
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard.</v>

711
00:36:24.041 --> 00:36:26.410
<v Speaker 2>There aren't super clear and easy </v>
<v Speaker 2>answers.</v>

712
00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:28.600
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ben has a different position.</v>

713
00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:30.790
<v Speaker 2>Obviously he's much more conservative on</v>
<v Speaker 2>that front,</v>

714
00:36:30.791 --> 00:36:32.680
<v Speaker 2>but that's a position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>

715
00:36:32.681 --> 00:36:34.150
<v Speaker 2>I have a lot of friends who were born </v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

716
00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:36.040
<v Speaker 2>Christians and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a physician.</v>

717
00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:40.630
<v Speaker 2>You can't just dismiss,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you have to talk about it like that</v>

718
00:36:40.631 --> 00:36:42.880
<v Speaker 2>to human position for people who have </v>
<v Speaker 2>not belief.</v>

719
00:36:42.970 --> 00:36:43.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so for me,</v>

720
00:36:43.811 --> 00:36:48.811
<v Speaker 2>what it really comes down to when </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's sort of different positions on </v>

721
00:36:48.811 --> 00:36:50.320
<v Speaker 2>stuff that's really fundamental for </v>
<v Speaker 2>people is to say,</v>

722
00:36:50.321 --> 00:36:51.120
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

723
00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:53.210
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like Democrats have to talk about</v>

724
00:36:53.211 --> 00:36:54.700
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We use it or more humanizing,</v>

725
00:36:54.701 --> 00:36:56.890
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't actually know what I would do in</v>

726
00:36:56.891 --> 00:36:59.750
<v Speaker 2>that circumstance if my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

727
00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:00.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

728
00:37:00.910 --> 00:37:01.550
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

729
00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:03.480
<v Speaker 2>was pregnant or girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

730
00:37:03.610 --> 00:37:06.670
<v Speaker 2>like it's a really hard choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not something that just flippant of</v>

731
00:37:06.671 --> 00:37:07.120
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

732
00:37:07.121 --> 00:37:09.370
<v Speaker 2>it's a cluster of cells and it carries </v>
<v Speaker 2>no emotional waves.</v>

733
00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:11.350
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't find that to be true.</v>

734
00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:13.630
<v Speaker 2>But for me there's a certain point where</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

735
00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:16.810
<v Speaker 2>that's ever true for anyone who has an </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience like that.</v>

736
00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:17.690
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

737
00:37:17.691 --> 00:37:19.990
<v Speaker 2>I feel right way to approach it the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

738
00:37:19.991 --> 00:37:21.790
<v Speaker 2>I think that the answer is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

739
00:37:21.791 --> 00:37:23.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what I would do.</v>

740
00:37:23.110 --> 00:37:25.180
<v Speaker 2>I don't claim to have all the answers </v>
<v Speaker 2>morally.</v>

741
00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:30.510
<v Speaker 2>The one thing that I believe is I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>want the government coming into your </v>

742
00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:33.400
<v Speaker 2>house and into your bedroom and telling </v>
<v Speaker 2>your life or you want to do like.</v>

743
00:37:33.401 --> 00:37:38.401
<v Speaker 2>That's something I feel like it's so </v>
<v Speaker 2>deeply personal and sometimes all you </v>

744
00:37:38.401 --> 00:37:39.400
<v Speaker 2>have are shitty choices and choices that</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't good.</v>

745
00:37:39.730 --> 00:37:44.730
<v Speaker 2>And the flip side for me is I don't know</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the alternative is when we're </v>

746
00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:45.220
<v Speaker 2>really talking with specifics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

747
00:37:45.221 --> 00:37:47.150
<v Speaker 2>a government mandated pregnancy looks </v>
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

748
00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:52.440
<v Speaker 2>So if a daughter or a niece who's 18 is </v>
<v Speaker 2>pregnant and doesn't want to have a </v>

749
00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:57.271
<v Speaker 2>child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the solution is to </v>

750
00:37:57.271 --> 00:37:59.281
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how does the government then </v>

751
00:37:59.281 --> 00:38:00.770
<v Speaker 2>mandate that and oversee that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so these are conversations that,</v>

752
00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:01.440
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

753
00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:05.080
<v Speaker 2>I think are legitimate conversations to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be had,</v>

754
00:38:05.350 --> 00:38:10.350
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but from a position of respect rather </v>

755
00:38:10.350 --> 00:38:10.350
<v Speaker 2>than,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

756
00:38:10.350 --> 00:38:14.580
<v Speaker 2>sort of slogans or the fact that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are prolife or anti anti </v>

757
00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:18.820
<v Speaker 2>women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's a lot of women who I </v>

758
00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:18.820
<v Speaker 2>know who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who have,</v>

759
00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:18.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deeply held prolife positions,</v>

760
00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:21.010
<v Speaker 2>I think it has to be a bit of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation for me.</v>

761
00:38:21.010 --> 00:38:23.830
<v Speaker 2>I feel like these are really personal </v>
<v Speaker 2>choices.</v>

762
00:38:23.831 --> 00:38:28.831
<v Speaker 2>I have a strong libertarian reaction to </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and I also don't understand what the </v>

763
00:38:28.831 --> 00:38:33.001
<v Speaker 2>solution is going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that does become something that </v>

764
00:38:33.001 --> 00:38:36.301
<v Speaker 2>somebody doesn't want to have a child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand how the government </v>

765
00:38:36.301 --> 00:38:36.730
<v Speaker 2>mandates that and what that looks like </v>
<v Speaker 2>for those nine months.</v>

766
00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:38.320
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

767
00:38:38.321 --> 00:38:41.200
<v Speaker 2>it's not an approach that is dismissive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all or nothing.</v>

768
00:38:41.201 --> 00:38:43.240
<v Speaker 2>It's an approach of having a </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation about,</v>

769
00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:48.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different values and we have different </v>

770
00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:50.311
<v Speaker 2>values and we have to figure out how to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to talk about them in ways that </v>

771
00:38:50.311 --> 00:38:50.311
<v Speaker 2>aren't dehumanizing.</v>

772
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:57.000
<v Speaker 1>So what do you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's a good plan for the next few </v>

773
00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:57.000
<v Speaker 1>months?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you,</v>

774
00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:57.000
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to try to do?</v>

775
00:38:57.260 --> 00:38:58.640
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a number of plans.</v>

776
00:38:58.641 --> 00:39:03.641
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of them is to keep Democrats focus </v>

777
00:39:03.641 --> 00:39:05.960
<v Speaker 2>on nuts and bolts issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also really,</v>

778
00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:11.020
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of republican voices that </v>

779
00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:12.590
<v Speaker 2>I think are really important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really liked Evan Mcmullin.</v>

780
00:39:12.591 --> 00:39:17.591
<v Speaker 2>I really liked where Wilson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a number of commentators who </v>

781
00:39:17.591 --> 00:39:18.920
<v Speaker 2>would been been really interesting and </v>
<v Speaker 2>compelling.</v>

782
00:39:18.921 --> 00:39:21.170
<v Speaker 2>I listened to the broad spectrum of </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

783
00:39:21.171 --> 00:39:26.171
<v Speaker 2>I wake up every morning and also read </v>
<v Speaker 2>the drudge report and watch Fox News to </v>

784
00:39:26.171 --> 00:39:30.960
<v Speaker 2>have an understanding of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of what opposing narratives are so that </v>

785
00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:33.900
<v Speaker 2>I can understand the full sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>spectrum and what's bothering people,</v>

786
00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:35.730
<v Speaker 2>what is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and my finger</v>

787
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:41.000
<v Speaker 1>Shapiro's a really good voice as far as </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm concerned because he's as </v>

788
00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.450
<v Speaker 1>intelligent and articulator of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>social conservative position as you </v>

789
00:39:44.450 --> 00:39:48.381
<v Speaker 1>could hope for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he's a great whetstone against </v>

790
00:39:48.381 --> 00:39:49.840
<v Speaker 1>which Democrats could sharpen their </v>
<v Speaker 1>knives were taken.</v>

791
00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:53.220
<v Speaker 1>If they can confront him in a reasonable</v>
<v Speaker 1>argument successfully,</v>

792
00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:55.560
<v Speaker 1>then they've already got the argument </v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

793
00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:56.320
<v Speaker 1>Because.</v>

794
00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:00.350
<v Speaker 2>And here's the thing with Ben.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got a great brain.</v>

795
00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:05.380
<v Speaker 2>I actually would like it if he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>playing less defense and actually we </v>

796
00:40:05.691 --> 00:40:07.790
<v Speaker 2>could be engaged the way that eric has </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be like,</v>

797
00:40:07.791 --> 00:40:08.930
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is your,</v>

798
00:40:08.931 --> 00:40:11.000
<v Speaker 2>what are your solutions and thoughts on </v>
<v Speaker 2>this from.</v>

799
00:40:11.310 --> 00:40:13.980
<v Speaker 2>There are some things he said that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>deeply disagree with.</v>

800
00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:17.840
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't believe that all trans </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are mentally ill.</v>

801
00:40:17.841 --> 00:40:22.841
<v Speaker 2>He has some physicians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but nothing that I've seen indicates to </v>

802
00:40:22.841 --> 00:40:24.430
<v Speaker 2>me that he's someone who can conceivably</v>
<v Speaker 2>be reason with.</v>

803
00:40:24.590 --> 00:40:27.620
<v Speaker 2>He's also pointed out in places where he</v>
<v Speaker 2>believes he's screwed up.</v>

804
00:40:27.890 --> 00:40:32.890
<v Speaker 2>He's written a whole articles about </v>
<v Speaker 2>reversing his position on things or </v>

805
00:40:32.890 --> 00:40:33.830
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said that was dom and well,</v>

806
00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:35.000
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's his words,</v>

807
00:40:35.001 --> 00:40:36.360
<v Speaker 2>not mine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

808
00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:38.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like the Ralph Waldo Emerson,</v>

809
00:40:38.570 --> 00:40:43.570
<v Speaker 2>foolish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>foolish consistency is the Hobgoblin of </v>

810
00:40:43.570 --> 00:40:46.601
<v Speaker 2>little minds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like how many of us have a </v>

811
00:40:46.601 --> 00:40:47.420
<v Speaker 2>completely consistent set of ideas and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so I feel like with them,</v>

812
00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:50.970
<v Speaker 2>and there was that big issue were marked</v>
<v Speaker 2>plus came out and sort of said,</v>

813
00:40:50.971 --> 00:40:55.971
<v Speaker 2>well why don't we listen to him?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there was a big uproar and then he </v>

814
00:40:55.971 --> 00:40:59.711
<v Speaker 2>apologized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's an interesting thing </v>

815
00:40:59.711 --> 00:40:59.711
<v Speaker 2>to discuss because from my perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your three views,</v>

816
00:40:59.711 --> 00:41:02.750
<v Speaker 2>if you're liberal adventure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one is that he's an alt right mouse,</v>

817
00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:06.050
<v Speaker 2>which I don't believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe that he's so far.</v>

818
00:41:06.051 --> 00:41:07.660
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should say fascists.</v>

819
00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:08.240
<v Speaker 2>Nazis.</v>

820
00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:09.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's.</v>

821
00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:11.680
<v Speaker 1>We need to define what the hell the alt </v>
<v Speaker 1>right is to,</v>

822
00:41:11.681 --> 00:41:13.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the old right is basically a cover story</v>

823
00:41:13.751 --> 00:41:18.751
<v Speaker 1>for white supremacy and for an f new </v>
<v Speaker 1>nationalist state and to target </v>

824
00:41:18.751 --> 00:41:20.050
<v Speaker 1>everybody who's conservative as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>outright figure,</v>

825
00:41:20.170 --> 00:41:22.090
<v Speaker 1>which is something that's happened to me</v>
<v Speaker 1>repeatedly,</v>

826
00:41:22.270 --> 00:41:24.650
<v Speaker 1>is absolutely counterproductive because</v>

827
00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:29.620
<v Speaker 2>our lectures on your opposition at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

828
00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:32.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's very easily disprovable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But with Ben,</v>

829
00:41:32.511 --> 00:41:35.060
<v Speaker 2>like let's for the sake of argument that</v>
<v Speaker 2>got to here,</v>

830
00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:40.780
<v Speaker 2>which I don't believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would you not want to pay attention </v>

831
00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:40.980
<v Speaker 2>or follow him or keep an eye on him or.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

832
00:41:40.981 --> 00:41:43.120
<v Speaker 2>what he's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like he's some crack pot,</v>

833
00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:48.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's someone who's very influential and </v>

834
00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:48.190
<v Speaker 2>has a lot of followers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So even if it's the case,</v>

835
00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:52.451
<v Speaker 2>which I believe it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand how not paying any </v>

836
00:41:52.451 --> 00:41:52.960
<v Speaker 2>attention to what's going on with him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's helpful.</v>

837
00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:54.050
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

838
00:41:54.051 --> 00:41:55.580
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gotta say one of the highlights,</v>

839
00:41:56.400 --> 00:42:00.960
<v Speaker 1>I think apple and facebook and spotify </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so forth just made with Alex Jones,</v>

840
00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:06.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they think they banned Alex </v>

841
00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:06.390
<v Speaker 1>Jones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that isn't what happened.</v>

842
00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:07.970
<v Speaker 1>What happened was they pushed his </v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of followers underground.</v>

843
00:42:08.430 --> 00:42:09.990
<v Speaker 1>That was a very bad idea</v>

844
00:42:10.350 --> 00:42:12.090
<v Speaker 2>and they're making a murder out of him.</v>

845
00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:16.310
<v Speaker 1>Justifying know he's a little on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>paranoid side,</v>

846
00:42:16.311 --> 00:42:18.320
<v Speaker 1>let's say is a real conspiracy </v>
<v Speaker 1>theorists.</v>

847
00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:23.620
<v Speaker 1>And the best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the worst thing you can possibly do to </v>

848
00:42:23.620 --> 00:42:24.530
<v Speaker 1>someone who's paranoid is to generate a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy to take them out.</v>

849
00:42:24.910 --> 00:42:27.800
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is the best thing you can do.</v>

850
00:42:27.801 --> 00:42:32.801
<v Speaker 2>When Alex Jones has said virtually </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing that I agree with on any front </v>

851
00:42:32.801 --> 00:42:34.830
<v Speaker 2>is to give him as much air time and as </v>
<v Speaker 2>much rope as possible</v>

852
00:42:35.170 --> 00:42:40.170
<v Speaker 1>or at least allowing access to that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same way that everyone else has </v>

853
00:42:40.170 --> 00:42:40.170
<v Speaker 1>access to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

854
00:42:40.170 --> 00:42:42.580
<v Speaker 1>because a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't watch Alex Jones,</v>

855
00:42:42.581 --> 00:42:47.581
<v Speaker 1>but there are a number of people on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right that I keep an eye on or the </v>

856
00:42:47.581 --> 00:42:50.371
<v Speaker 1>farther right because I want to see what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're up to and as soon as that </v>

857
00:42:50.371 --> 00:42:54.930
<v Speaker 1>becomes impossible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have no idea what those people </v>

858
00:42:54.930 --> 00:42:57.511
<v Speaker 1>are up to and how the hell are you </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be able to deal with it if </v>

859
00:42:57.511 --> 00:42:57.511
<v Speaker 1>you can't figure out what it is.</v>

860
00:42:57.511 --> 00:42:59.890
<v Speaker 2>Well worked for not watching it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm a big fan.</v>

861
00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:04.910
<v Speaker 2>I like I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big fan of the aspect of the ECLU </v>

862
00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:08.280
<v Speaker 2>was the Skokie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was we show up if Nazis want to </v>

863
00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:11.881
<v Speaker 2>march right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we will protect their right to </v>

864
00:43:11.881 --> 00:43:14.110
<v Speaker 2>peacefully march and it's like I have </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who I despise.</v>

865
00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:19.620
<v Speaker 2>It's like get out there and appoint will</v>
<v Speaker 2>be crushed by the free marketplace of </v>

866
00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:22.870
<v Speaker 2>ideas I have not believed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have to allow for it.</v>

867
00:43:22.871 --> 00:43:24.700
<v Speaker 2>And the more that we murder and shut </v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

868
00:43:24.701 --> 00:43:25.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

869
00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:29.810
<v Speaker 1>You don't know how many people were </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching Alex Jones to keep an eye on.</v>

870
00:43:30.810 --> 00:43:31.510
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

871
00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:33.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't imagine it was a tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 1>number of people,</v>

872
00:43:33.771 --> 00:43:34.900
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't none.</v>

873
00:43:35.710 --> 00:43:40.710
<v Speaker 2>Bryce,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bryce will love you and I have talked </v>

874
00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:43.731
<v Speaker 2>about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the highlights of my </v>

875
00:43:43.731 --> 00:43:43.731
<v Speaker 2>undergraduate years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

876
00:43:43.731 --> 00:43:47.580
<v Speaker 2>was when the bell curve came out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a debate at the Kennedy Center</v>

877
00:43:47.850 --> 00:43:52.050
<v Speaker 2>and Dick Herrnstein,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who I had as a professor had passed away</v>

878
00:43:52.051 --> 00:43:55.590
<v Speaker 2>and Charles Murray was sort of left to </v>
<v Speaker 2>defend it against Stephen Jay Gould.</v>

879
00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:57.780
<v Speaker 2>And it was a very high level of </v>
<v Speaker 2>discourse.</v>

880
00:43:57.810 --> 00:44:00.780
<v Speaker 2>And Henry Louis Gates gave the </v>
<v Speaker 2>introduction.</v>

881
00:44:00.810 --> 00:44:05.810
<v Speaker 2>Things were very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very heated on campus because of their </v>

882
00:44:05.810 --> 00:44:06.810
<v Speaker 2>claims about racial differences in Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a very flashpoint issue.</v>

883
00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:10.710
<v Speaker 2>And skip gates gave a spectacular </v>
<v Speaker 2>introduction and he said,</v>

884
00:44:10.711 --> 00:44:15.711
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of sentiments roiling </v>

885
00:44:15.711 --> 00:44:18.771
<v Speaker 2>around this issue and the best possible </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that we can do is to dispute and </v>

886
00:44:18.771 --> 00:44:23.421
<v Speaker 2>defend and dismissed the aspects of this</v>
<v Speaker 2>that aren't correct here openly and </v>

887
00:44:23.551 --> 00:44:25.860
<v Speaker 2>publicly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there was a big debate.</v>

888
00:44:25.861 --> 00:44:29.910
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the student groups stood up and</v>
<v Speaker 2>walked out after that,</v>

889
00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:34.650
<v Speaker 2>intrigued from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the amazing intellectual minds,</v>

890
00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:35.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

891
00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:36.690
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

892
00:44:36.691 --> 00:44:37.560
<v Speaker 2>in the country.</v>

893
00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:42.800
<v Speaker 2>And so I just went down and sat in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>front row because people that hit it </v>

894
00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:43.350
<v Speaker 2>piled out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like I wanted to hear the debate,</v>

895
00:44:43.351 --> 00:44:44.750
<v Speaker 2>I want to hear the size from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>

896
00:44:44.770 --> 00:44:47.280
<v Speaker 2>from all different arenas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was totally,</v>

897
00:44:47.490 --> 00:44:51.720
<v Speaker 2>totally captivating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but his point was once someone's a crack</v>

898
00:44:51.721 --> 00:44:54.880
<v Speaker 2>pot and they don't have any followers </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's stupid,</v>

899
00:44:54.910 --> 00:44:56.190
<v Speaker 2>racist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bellowing things,</v>

900
00:44:56.490 --> 00:45:01.490
<v Speaker 2>it's fine to ignore people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a certain point where when it's </v>

901
00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:04.581
<v Speaker 2>Dick Herrnstein and Charles Murray,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a point where that needs to be </v>

902
00:45:04.581 --> 00:45:08.301
<v Speaker 2>debated publicly and openly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the fact that the chair of the </v>

903
00:45:08.301 --> 00:45:09.120
<v Speaker 2>African American Studies Department was </v>
<v Speaker 2>advocating for that to me,</v>

904
00:45:09.330 --> 00:45:11.310
<v Speaker 2>I thought was really important and </v>
<v Speaker 2>should be heated.</v>

905
00:45:11.550 --> 00:45:16.550
<v Speaker 2>That we need these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these debates to be had and the aspects </v>

906
00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:19.641
<v Speaker 2>that are incorrect me to be for a in </v>
<v Speaker 2>enlightenment way in a very intense and </v>

907
00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:24.450
<v Speaker 2>pollock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's something that I've always</v>

908
00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:27.070
<v Speaker 2>sort of held to is I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

909
00:45:27.450 --> 00:45:32.450
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's also part of this about </v>

910
00:45:32.450 --> 00:45:32.450
<v Speaker 2>sort of a toughness argument.</v>

911
00:45:32.450 --> 00:45:34.440
<v Speaker 2>My grandfather went down during the </v>
<v Speaker 2>civil rights movement.</v>

912
00:45:34.441 --> 00:45:38.400
<v Speaker 2>He was a Jewish lawyer from Manhattan </v>
<v Speaker 2>and went down to the deep south to stick</v>

913
00:45:38.401 --> 00:45:39.690
<v Speaker 2>up for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

914
00:45:39.691 --> 00:45:44.691
<v Speaker 2>to represent African Americans who've </v>
<v Speaker 2>been convicted of crimes against white </v>

915
00:45:44.691 --> 00:45:49.671
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's one case in particular that was </v>

916
00:45:49.671 --> 00:45:51.411
<v Speaker 2>totally ridiculous and he went down and </v>
<v Speaker 2>people tried to run his car off a cliff </v>

917
00:45:51.411 --> 00:45:54.630
<v Speaker 2>and kill him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so part of it for me too is like I'm</v>

918
00:45:54.631 --> 00:45:57.960
<v Speaker 2>from La Mindset of light,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tough liberals who want to,</v>

919
00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:00.120
<v Speaker 2>who actually can stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need,</v>

920
00:46:00.121 --> 00:46:03.300
<v Speaker 2>we need people to be toughened on all </v>
<v Speaker 2>sides of discourse.</v>

921
00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:04.700
<v Speaker 2>And I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

922
00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:07.020
<v Speaker 2>when people were burning copies of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ulysses,</v>

923
00:46:07.290 --> 00:46:12.290
<v Speaker 2>I feel like we're supposed to be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ones with the fire hose is putting out </v>

924
00:46:12.290 --> 00:46:15.201
<v Speaker 2>the fires were supposed to be the ones </v>
<v Speaker 2>who can be really tough and standard </v>

925
00:46:15.201 --> 00:46:15.201
<v Speaker 2>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if we can't do that,</v>

926
00:46:15.201 --> 00:46:18.540
<v Speaker 2>if we're gonna duck from those fights </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that hardening of,</v>

927
00:46:18.541 --> 00:46:18.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

928
00:46:18.961 --> 00:46:19.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

929
00:46:19.681 --> 00:46:21.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of intense positive,</v>

930
00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:26.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm really tough version of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of what the points are that we're </v>

931
00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:26.760
<v Speaker 2>arguing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's not,</v>

932
00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:28.620
<v Speaker 2>it's not a legitimate case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to be.</v>

933
00:46:28.650 --> 00:46:33.650
<v Speaker 2>That's what we need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a tough time and we need tough </v>

934
00:46:33.650 --> 00:46:33.650
<v Speaker 2>discourse.</v>

935
00:46:33.650 --> 00:46:37.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that and that is exactly why you </v>

936
00:46:37.290 --> 00:46:39.091
<v Speaker 1>should seek out the most articulate </v>
<v Speaker 1>exponents of your have your opponent's </v>

937
00:46:39.091 --> 00:46:39.430
<v Speaker 1>position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

938
00:46:39.431 --> 00:46:44.431
<v Speaker 1>I just had that experience talking with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sam Harris and we talked for 10 hours </v>

939
00:46:44.431 --> 00:46:45.400
<v Speaker 1>and you know there are things we agree </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

940
00:46:45.550 --> 00:46:50.550
<v Speaker 1>One of the most fundamental things is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that both Sam and I are concerned that </v>

941
00:46:50.550 --> 00:46:54.990
<v Speaker 1>our ethical structures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be better if our ethical </v>

942
00:46:54.990 --> 00:46:58.261
<v Speaker 1>structures were grounded in something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was self evidently solid and so he </v>

943
00:46:58.261 --> 00:47:02.071
<v Speaker 1>wants to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wants to ground ethics in the realm </v>

944
00:47:02.071 --> 00:47:02.410
<v Speaker 1>of fact and I can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can understand that it's.</v>

945
00:47:02.411 --> 00:47:05.890
<v Speaker 1>It's a perfectly valid desire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe it's possible in the way</v>

946
00:47:05.891 --> 00:47:08.650
<v Speaker 1>that he sees it as possible and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about that a lot,</v>

947
00:47:08.651 --> 00:47:13.651
<v Speaker 1>but I learned a tremendous amount as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of discussing things with </v>

948
00:47:13.651 --> 00:47:16.420
<v Speaker 1>him over a 10 hour period because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>pushed me.</v>

949
00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:19.270
<v Speaker 2>You need to be pushed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

950
00:47:19.271 --> 00:47:24.271
<v Speaker 2>because all the kinds of holes and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>need to go in understanding that you </v>

951
00:47:24.291 --> 00:47:25.700
<v Speaker 2>might not have all the answers</v>

952
00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:27.420
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't have all the answers.</v>

953
00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:34.050
<v Speaker 2>What I think is interesting is your </v>
<v Speaker 2>approach to that is to ground things in </v>

954
00:47:34.050 --> 00:47:35.470
<v Speaker 2>an evolutionary model,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think is a pretty good bedrock,</v>

955
00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:38.200
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's been your sort of approach</v>

956
00:47:38.201 --> 00:47:43.000
<v Speaker 2>to this is to talk about like a sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>archetypal and evolutionary underlay,</v>

957
00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:46.240
<v Speaker 2>but Sam's unbelievably articulate and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sharp.</v>

958
00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:48.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had the pleasure of having dinner with</v>

959
00:47:48.371 --> 00:47:52.240
<v Speaker 2>you and him and Douglas Murray in London</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's a vibrant,</v>

960
00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:57.390
<v Speaker 2>respectful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes disagreeable mode of </v>

961
00:47:57.390 --> 00:47:58.060
<v Speaker 2>conversation that's incredibly fruitful.</v>

962
00:47:58.810 --> 00:48:01.550
<v Speaker 1>It's also stressful as hell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

963
00:48:01.551 --> 00:48:06.551
<v Speaker 1>because you can definitely get put on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the spot and have your cherished </v>

964
00:48:06.551 --> 00:48:09.510
<v Speaker 1>assumptions undermined as well as look </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a fool because you know,</v>

965
00:48:09.660 --> 00:48:12.650
<v Speaker 1>some of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you have an argument,</v>

966
00:48:12.651 --> 00:48:15.020
<v Speaker 1>well thought through in that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>discourse,</v>

967
00:48:15.021 --> 00:48:17.690
<v Speaker 1>you don't have it immediately at hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You forget about it.</v>

968
00:48:18.050 --> 00:48:22.580
<v Speaker 1>And then it appear as if you're a fool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you put a lot on the line and the</v>

969
00:48:22.581 --> 00:48:23.600
<v Speaker 1>discussion like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

970
00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:28.690
<v Speaker 2>no one's paying attention to any of this</v>
<v Speaker 2>for you to.</v>

971
00:48:30.570 --> 00:48:31.960
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

972
00:48:32.540 --> 00:48:33.580
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>

973
00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:36.310
<v Speaker 2>So one quick thing before we move on </v>
<v Speaker 2>with this.</v>

974
00:48:36.311 --> 00:48:40.270
<v Speaker 2>So there's a lot of proposals that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>there that are floated.</v>

975
00:48:40.271 --> 00:48:45.271
<v Speaker 2>Let's say there's an economic idea that </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody has in that wants to be passed </v>

976
00:48:45.281 --> 00:48:50.281
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first thing that I do with it is I </v>

977
00:48:50.281 --> 00:48:52.711
<v Speaker 2>send it to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend who's a really sharp </v>

978
00:48:52.711 --> 00:48:52.840
<v Speaker 2>libertarian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend who's a hardcore kind of</v>

979
00:48:52.841 --> 00:48:57.670
<v Speaker 2>Wall Street Republican and I have </v>
<v Speaker 2>another friend who's kind of a big money</v>

980
00:48:57.730 --> 00:49:02.730
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they represent sort of the different </v>

981
00:49:02.730 --> 00:49:04.831
<v Speaker 2>poles of economic policy from the things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that some of the policies that might be </v>

982
00:49:04.831 --> 00:49:09.750
<v Speaker 2>interesting to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first thing they do is send it to </v>

983
00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:11.821
<v Speaker 2>all of them and go poke as many holes in</v>
<v Speaker 2>this as you possibly can and tell me </v>

984
00:49:11.821 --> 00:49:11.821
<v Speaker 2>what all blind spots.</v>

985
00:49:12.130 --> 00:49:15.220
<v Speaker 2>And that's not only for me to cover all </v>
<v Speaker 2>those arguments.</v>

986
00:49:15.250 --> 00:49:18.520
<v Speaker 2>It's also for me to be able to learn and</v>
<v Speaker 2>see if there's a better approach to it.</v>

987
00:49:18.521 --> 00:49:23.521
<v Speaker 2>If it's fundamentally flawed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then certainly if I'm going to </v>

988
00:49:23.521 --> 00:49:24.970
<v Speaker 2>advocate something that's a new policy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not strong on economics.</v>

989
00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:28.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's probably my weakest spot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's the sort of know if we're going</v>

990
00:49:28.741 --> 00:49:33.741
<v Speaker 2>to advocate it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are all the pitfalls were falling </v>

991
00:49:33.741 --> 00:49:33.741
<v Speaker 2>into and what are we potentially </v>
<v Speaker 2>missing?</v>

992
00:49:33.741 --> 00:49:38.370
<v Speaker 2>And I find very few people are taking an</v>
<v Speaker 2>approach like this and there's one of </v>

993
00:49:38.370 --> 00:49:41.761
<v Speaker 2>the things that I think is exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's funny with the idw has this sort </v>

994
00:49:41.761 --> 00:49:41.761
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

995
00:49:42.250 --> 00:49:47.250
<v Speaker 2>fear of an alt right overlay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the majority of guys skew pretty </v>

996
00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:47.250
<v Speaker 2>liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

997
00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:49.060
<v Speaker 2>if you look at Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at Dave's certainly,</v>

998
00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:51.160
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at Eric and Brad,</v>

999
00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:56.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's got more of a skew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what's nice is ideas can be parsed </v>

1000
00:49:56.220 --> 00:49:58.570
<v Speaker 2>in a way where as much as it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>embarrassing when you're put on the spot</v>

1001
00:49:58.571 --> 00:50:01.390
<v Speaker 2>and you're wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one's looking at twists the knife.</v>

1002
00:50:01.870 --> 00:50:03.610
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's kind of saying,</v>

1003
00:50:03.611 --> 00:50:04.900
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I disagree with this.</v>

1004
00:50:05.010 --> 00:50:07.420
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have a tie disagreeableness,</v>

1005
00:50:07.421 --> 00:50:08.830
<v Speaker 2>but it's recycled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1006
00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:08.990
<v Speaker 2>it's</v>

1007
00:50:08.990 --> 00:50:11.910
<v Speaker 1>also based,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least to some degree on trust.</v>

1008
00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:17.360
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I can assume that you're different </v>

1009
00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:17.360
<v Speaker 1>than me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>temperamentally,</v>

1010
00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:21.080
<v Speaker 1>but that you're actually striving </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards the truth and we can have a </v>

1011
00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:21.300
<v Speaker 1>discussion and I certainly feel that </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Sam.</v>

1012
00:50:21.930 --> 00:50:23.580
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that.</v>

1013
00:50:23.581 --> 00:50:27.710
<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that he's an honest person and</v>

1014
00:50:27.711 --> 00:50:30.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or I believe that he's dishonest as me,</v>

1015
00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:35.800
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is more to the point because well </v>

1016
00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:39.611
<v Speaker 1>maybe an honest person is too high a </v>
<v Speaker 1>barrier for anyone to actually achieve </v>

1017
00:50:39.611 --> 00:50:41.540
<v Speaker 1>given all of our faults,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't believe there's any evidence</v>

1018
00:50:41.541 --> 00:50:45.380
<v Speaker 1>that he's striving with less intensity </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards the truth than I am.</v>

1019
00:50:48.330 --> 00:50:51.080
<v Speaker 2>The furthest right in the group is </v>
<v Speaker 2>clearly bad.</v>

1020
00:50:51.170 --> 00:50:52.790
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when to get back to that point.</v>

1021
00:50:52.791 --> 00:50:57.791
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's sort of three </v>
<v Speaker 2>approaches is a horrible human and he's </v>

1022
00:50:57.791 --> 00:51:01.780
<v Speaker 2>a hardcore old writer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in which case if you believe that why </v>

1023
00:51:01.780 --> 00:51:02.480
<v Speaker 2>from a Sun Tzu perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>art of war,</v>

1024
00:51:02.481 --> 00:51:04.370
<v Speaker 2>would you not want to know your enemy </v>
<v Speaker 2>and figure it out?</v>

1025
00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:07.850
<v Speaker 2>Or He's somebody who has views and </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideologies.</v>

1026
00:51:07.851 --> 00:51:09.100
<v Speaker 2>I disagreed with him on a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a,</v>

1027
00:51:09.130 --> 00:51:14.130
<v Speaker 2>on a number of fronts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's somebody who is it who is </v>

1028
00:51:14.130 --> 00:51:18.320
<v Speaker 2>interested in the truth and is willing </v>
<v Speaker 2>to admit when he has gone too far or not</v>

1029
00:51:18.321 --> 00:51:19.640
<v Speaker 2>gone too far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the wrong phrase.</v>

1030
00:51:19.641 --> 00:51:24.641
<v Speaker 2>He's willing to admit mistakes that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>perceives that he's nate and is also </v>

1031
00:51:24.641 --> 00:51:28.930
<v Speaker 2>taking new information and it's like I'd</v>
<v Speaker 2>love to actually have a discussion with </v>

1032
00:51:28.930 --> 00:51:29.480
<v Speaker 2>him about something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a discussion,</v>

1033
00:51:29.481 --> 00:51:31.440
<v Speaker 2>not a debate because he's a world class </v>
<v Speaker 2>innovator.</v>

1034
00:51:31.470 --> 00:51:36.470
<v Speaker 2>He would probably biliterate me but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but an actual meaningful discussion </v>

1035
00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:37.460
<v Speaker 2>about some of the stuff where I see </v>
<v Speaker 2>there to be differences.</v>

1036
00:51:38.890 --> 00:51:40.540
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he might be in for that.</v>

1037
00:51:40.570 --> 00:51:45.570
<v Speaker 1>Like you and I have discussed the </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility of finding high resolution </v>

1038
00:51:46.211 --> 00:51:51.211
<v Speaker 1>intelligent centrist Democrats and </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting some of these idw people to </v>

1039
00:51:51.211 --> 00:51:51.790
<v Speaker 1>interact with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1040
00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:57.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that looks like it's a real possibility </v>

1041
00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:57.080
<v Speaker 1>and be interesting to see what that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would do to the political discourse.</v>

1042
00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:59.710
<v Speaker 1>And I guess this is a step on that step </v>
<v Speaker 1>in that direction.</v>

1043
00:51:59.711 --> 00:52:04.711
<v Speaker 1>I talked to Bandon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Dave Rubin and to show our,</v>

1044
00:52:05.210 --> 00:52:08.440
<v Speaker 1>or to um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Sam and uh,</v>

1045
00:52:08.950 --> 00:52:11.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothetically there,</v>

1046
00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:16.060
<v Speaker 1>there are at least willing to look into </v>
<v Speaker 1>this as a possibility and it would be </v>

1047
00:52:16.060 --> 00:52:16.060
<v Speaker 1>very interesting as well.</v>

1048
00:52:17.980 --> 00:52:18.740
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1049
00:52:18.820 --> 00:52:23.820
<v Speaker 1>it would also be very interesting to see</v>
<v Speaker 1>how this would play out with regards to </v>

1050
00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:25.150
<v Speaker 1>log form discourse because we need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>find politicians.</v>

1051
00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:27.640
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things Joe told me when I was</v>

1052
00:52:27.641 --> 00:52:28.570
<v Speaker 1>talking to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

1053
00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:33.600
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was talking to him about his </v>

1054
00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:33.600
<v Speaker 1>three hour interviews,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1055
00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:33.940
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does that ever not work out for people?</v>

1056
00:52:33.941 --> 00:52:34.750
<v Speaker 1>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well yeah,</v>

1057
00:52:34.751 --> 00:52:37.900
<v Speaker 1>I've had guests on who just run out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>steam in about 45 minutes.</v>

1058
00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:43.870
<v Speaker 1>They don't have anything else to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we don't need politicians who run </v>

1059
00:52:43.870 --> 00:52:45.820
<v Speaker 1>out of steam at 45 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need people who can engage in intense</v>

1060
00:52:45.821 --> 00:52:48.340
<v Speaker 1>discussion for three hours without </v>
<v Speaker 1>running out of detail,</v>

1061
00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:52.540
<v Speaker 1>without running out of ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a detailed grasp of the political realm.</v>

1062
00:52:52.541 --> 00:52:57.541
<v Speaker 1>And we need to be able to see that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we could move away from these six </v>

1063
00:52:57.541 --> 00:52:57.940
<v Speaker 1>minute CNN interviews and</v>

1064
00:52:58.450 --> 00:53:00.770
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's moving away from the tweets and the</v>

1065
00:53:00.771 --> 00:53:05.771
<v Speaker 2>nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which to my mind is inherently </v>

1066
00:53:05.771 --> 00:53:05.771
<v Speaker 2>polarizing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1067
00:53:05.771 --> 00:53:09.671
<v Speaker 2>look at what this asshole hardcore lefty</v>
<v Speaker 2>get on a college campus or look at this </v>

1068
00:53:10.671 --> 00:53:15.671
<v Speaker 2>most egregious example of something over</v>
<v Speaker 2>here and I'm not saying those things </v>

1069
00:53:15.671 --> 00:53:16.430
<v Speaker 2>aren't important or that we don't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to pay attention to them,</v>

1070
00:53:16.940 --> 00:53:21.940
<v Speaker 2>but the vast majority of people in </v>
<v Speaker 2>America right now me real nuts and bolts</v>

1071
00:53:22.131 --> 00:53:25.840
<v Speaker 2>solutions and corruption.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe</v>

1072
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:30.980
<v Speaker 1>there's a technological rule here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so imagine that this is like we could </v>

1073
00:53:30.980 --> 00:53:34.380
<v Speaker 1>call this the Peterson principle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say the narrower the bandwidth,</v>

1074
00:53:34.381 --> 00:53:37.290
<v Speaker 1>the more likely polarized information </v>
<v Speaker 1>will be delivered over it.</v>

1075
00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:42.960
<v Speaker 2>I think it's great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think we should call it the </v>

1076
00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:42.960
<v Speaker 2>principal.</v>

1077
00:53:43.010 --> 00:53:45.260
<v Speaker 1>You'll have to come up with a more </v>
<v Speaker 1>elegant formulation,</v>

1078
00:53:45.650 --> 00:53:49.310
<v Speaker 1>but it seems to me that that's highly </v>
<v Speaker 1>probable because if you have to compress</v>

1079
00:53:49.311 --> 00:53:54.100
<v Speaker 1>complex information into a very narrow </v>
<v Speaker 1>channel and and broadcast tv would would</v>

1080
00:53:54.110 --> 00:53:57.380
<v Speaker 1>certainly qualify.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And twitter of course even worse is that</v>

1081
00:53:57.500 --> 00:54:00.560
<v Speaker 1>you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to radically oversimplify it,</v>

1082
00:54:01.380 --> 00:54:05.500
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because like I said,</v>

1083
00:54:05.501 --> 00:54:10.501
<v Speaker 2>I a lot of friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean across the gamut of political </v>

1084
00:54:10.501 --> 00:54:11.700
<v Speaker 2>orientations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read a lot of news and follow a lot of</v>

1085
00:54:11.710 --> 00:54:16.710
<v Speaker 2>people across the political orientation </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the way left to right or right or </v>

1086
00:54:17.171 --> 00:54:22.171
<v Speaker 2>very far left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm talking about within a </v>

1087
00:54:22.171 --> 00:54:23.770
<v Speaker 2>reasonable poles and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

1088
00:54:23.830 --> 00:54:28.830
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing to me how skewed it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you turn on MSNBC and Fox News,</v>

1089
00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:34.460
<v Speaker 2>we're in two different worlds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you read the Huffington post and </v>

1090
00:54:34.460 --> 00:54:34.460
<v Speaker 2>drudge report and so it's very easy to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get.</v>

1091
00:54:34.540 --> 00:54:39.540
<v Speaker 2>Like I think I have more of awareness of</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the triggers are for conservatives </v>

1092
00:54:39.820 --> 00:54:44.820
<v Speaker 2>and what the triggers are for liberals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also the fact that these triggers </v>

1093
00:54:44.820 --> 00:54:47.530
<v Speaker 2>are getting this outsize era time </v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly.</v>

1094
00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:52.640
<v Speaker 2>Bio is condensed means of information </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's where like the IB </v>

1095
00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:56.140
<v Speaker 2>dealt with you like there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's way more listeners to.</v>

1096
00:54:56.141 --> 00:55:00.240
<v Speaker 2>You guys didn't make any fucking sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the fact that you had 10,</v>

1097
00:55:00.250 --> 00:55:03.400
<v Speaker 2>two and a half hour lectures from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychological underpinnings of the Bible</v>

1098
00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:06.670
<v Speaker 2>and that more than two people watch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That makes no sense.</v>

1099
00:55:07.060 --> 00:55:12.060
<v Speaker 2>And so there's a ton of people who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>really curious for more in depth </v>

1100
00:55:12.060 --> 00:55:15.391
<v Speaker 2>analysis is being met elsewhere and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think that's where the polls have been </v>

1101
00:55:15.391 --> 00:55:18.991
<v Speaker 2>missing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that that proverbial proverbial </v>

1102
00:55:18.991 --> 00:55:22.081
<v Speaker 2>lead a group of people who are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are being missed and you aren't </v>

1103
00:55:22.081 --> 00:55:22.081
<v Speaker 2>being discounted.</v>

1104
00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:22.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

1105
00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:28.820
<v Speaker 2>you know it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really important that we have the </v>

1106
00:55:28.820 --> 00:55:28.820
<v Speaker 2>more in depth conversations about it.</v>

1107
00:55:29.220 --> 00:55:34.220
<v Speaker 1>So that's our little conspiracy plant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak then is to take this to,</v>

1108
00:55:36.820 --> 00:55:41.820
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to inquire if the people who've been </v>

1109
00:55:41.820 --> 00:55:44.481
<v Speaker 1>loosely grouped together as the idw are </v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to engage in serious discourse </v>

1110
00:55:44.821 --> 00:55:47.370
<v Speaker 1>with to begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with centrist Democrats.</v>

1111
00:55:47.371 --> 00:55:52.371
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't have to be limited to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that's a nice counter play </v>

1112
00:55:52.371 --> 00:55:52.371
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

1113
00:55:52.371 --> 00:55:56.160
<v Speaker 2>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can even be Democrats who aren't </v>

1114
00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:58.651
<v Speaker 2>centrist or tilting even left of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are willing to engage in civil </v>

1115
00:55:59.650 --> 00:56:04.650
<v Speaker 2>discourse and might even have like </v>
<v Speaker 2>different districts and states have </v>

1116
00:56:04.650 --> 00:56:07.360
<v Speaker 2>different notions and it might really </v>
<v Speaker 2>make sense for an aspect of the party of</v>

1117
00:56:07.450 --> 00:56:12.450
<v Speaker 2>further lab to test something in San </v>
<v Speaker 2>Francisco or New York and see what new </v>

1118
00:56:12.450 --> 00:56:12.670
<v Speaker 2>ideas come out of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1119
00:56:12.671 --> 00:56:16.030
<v Speaker 2>It's just for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can't be with moral condescension and</v>

1120
00:56:16.031 --> 00:56:17.680
<v Speaker 2>it can't be a purity tests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1121
00:56:17.681 --> 00:56:22.681
<v Speaker 2>you and I've talked so much about how </v>
<v Speaker 2>the left and the right get off track in </v>

1122
00:56:22.681 --> 00:56:23.260
<v Speaker 2>different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The right gets very fascist.</v>

1123
00:56:23.420 --> 00:56:26.140
<v Speaker 2>You see them coming and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1124
00:56:26.190 --> 00:56:27.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fascistic overlay.</v>

1125
00:56:27.850 --> 00:56:29.500
<v Speaker 2>We know what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Historically,</v>

1126
00:56:29.770 --> 00:56:34.770
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll go heavily towards voter </v>

1127
00:56:34.770 --> 00:56:36.571
<v Speaker 2>suppression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of issues that are very </v>

1128
00:56:36.571 --> 00:56:38.521
<v Speaker 2>highly problematic on that side of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fence and when it gets so ethnocentric.</v>

1129
00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:41.020
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or your sense,</v>

1130
00:56:41.021 --> 00:56:41.700
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

1131
00:56:41.870 --> 00:56:43.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1132
00:56:43.091 --> 00:56:44.290
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>

1133
00:56:44.350 --> 00:56:48.490
<v Speaker 2>illegal or hardcore power grounding in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>way that's effective,</v>

1134
00:56:48.610 --> 00:56:50.440
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And with the left,</v>

1135
00:56:50.441 --> 00:56:51.290
<v Speaker 2>the left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1136
00:56:51.291 --> 00:56:55.150
<v Speaker 2>cannibalizes and its purity tests and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>goes kind of crazy that way.</v>

1137
00:56:55.480 --> 00:57:00.480
<v Speaker 2>I think that we are seeing from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Democrats now and awareness that the </v>

1138
00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:04.320
<v Speaker 2>real solutions need to be offered again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anticorruption is a huge thing that I'm </v>

1139
00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:05.860
<v Speaker 2>seeing Democrats start to tackle in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very serious way.</v>

1140
00:57:06.220 --> 00:57:07.450
<v Speaker 2>Healthcare jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>education.</v>

1141
00:57:08.110 --> 00:57:10.600
<v Speaker 2>And it's really important that these </v>
<v Speaker 2>things get brought out.</v>

1142
00:57:10.601 --> 00:57:15.601
<v Speaker 2>And so for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like we can test things that are </v>

1143
00:57:15.601 --> 00:57:16.510
<v Speaker 2>further or further left and see it work </v>
<v Speaker 2>or don't work,</v>

1144
00:57:17.370 --> 00:57:22.370
<v Speaker 2>but we also need to do that from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>position that isn't morally </v>

1145
00:57:22.370 --> 00:57:25.111
<v Speaker 2>condescending and a position that's also</v>
<v Speaker 2>appreciative of different cultures and </v>

1146
00:57:25.111 --> 00:57:25.111
<v Speaker 2>different places around the country.</v>

1147
00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:30.420
<v Speaker 2>What's going to work in up in New York </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't going to work in Alabama and </v>

1148
00:57:30.420 --> 00:57:34.411
<v Speaker 2>liberals are so good at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it understanding and </v>

1149
00:57:34.411 --> 00:57:35.290
<v Speaker 2>appreciating other cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1150
00:57:35.291 --> 00:57:38.470
<v Speaker 2>like it's one of the things that is sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a trademark.</v>

1151
00:57:38.471 --> 00:57:43.471
<v Speaker 2>But it's interesting to me that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I think we have fallen down on our </v>

1152
00:57:43.471 --> 00:57:44.020
<v Speaker 2>understanding of different cultures </v>
<v Speaker 2>within the United States.</v>

1153
00:57:44.890 --> 00:57:46.450
<v Speaker 2>And so it's this very interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>divide.</v>

1154
00:57:46.451 --> 00:57:48.790
<v Speaker 2>But like if it's foreign or perceived as</v>
<v Speaker 2>exotic,</v>

1155
00:57:48.850 --> 00:57:53.850
<v Speaker 2>it's all good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like we need a better understanding </v>

1156
00:57:53.850 --> 00:57:53.850
<v Speaker 2>of certain cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also.</v>

1157
00:57:53.850 --> 00:57:54.820
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1158
00:57:55.300 --> 00:57:56.290
<v Speaker 2>Alabama,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Texas,</v>

1159
00:57:57.010 --> 00:57:59.680
<v Speaker 2>certainly as guilty of this too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the right treats.</v>

1160
00:57:59.980 --> 00:58:03.440
<v Speaker 2>Chicago is if it's some like horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1161
00:58:03.640 --> 00:58:05.530
<v Speaker 2>no man's land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying this is a problem,</v>

1162
00:58:05.531 --> 00:58:10.531
<v Speaker 2>only your belief.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm saying we could really benefit </v>

1163
00:58:10.531 --> 00:58:10.840
<v Speaker 2>with conversations and talking to a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of candidates in Oklahoma,</v>

1164
00:58:11.260 --> 00:58:16.260
<v Speaker 2>in Orange County,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Texas who have an understanding of </v>

1165
00:58:16.260 --> 00:58:20.161
<v Speaker 2>their constituents and what they want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do is help them and to present a </v>

1166
00:58:20.161 --> 00:58:23.641
<v Speaker 2>reasonable alternative solutions to them</v>
<v Speaker 2>about real issues and not the bullshit </v>

1167
00:58:23.641 --> 00:58:24.130
<v Speaker 2>that everybody is engaging.</v>

1168
00:58:24.910 --> 00:58:26.980
<v Speaker 2>It's absolutely essential.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if we,</v>

1169
00:58:27.010 --> 00:58:29.500
<v Speaker 2>if we offer all that and lose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then tough luck.</v>

1170
00:58:29.530 --> 00:58:31.800
<v Speaker 2>We've got to make a better case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got to make a better argument.</v>

1171
00:58:32.050 --> 00:58:36.800
<v Speaker 2>Like we screwed up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got to try harder and that way.</v>

1172
00:58:36.820 --> 00:58:37.720
<v Speaker 2>The other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jordan,</v>

1173
00:58:37.721 --> 00:58:42.721
<v Speaker 2>that's really heartening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm seeing a lot of the actual </v>

1174
00:58:42.721 --> 00:58:45.541
<v Speaker 2>candidates as opposed to the noise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is more and more of an emphasis on </v>

1175
00:58:45.541 --> 00:58:46.150
<v Speaker 2>personal accountability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1176
00:58:46.151 --> 00:58:51.151
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about helping people and creating </v>

1177
00:58:51.151 --> 00:58:52.660
<v Speaker 2>new opportunities for them economically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in a way that empowers them with the</v>

1178
00:58:52.661 --> 00:58:57.340
<v Speaker 2>freedom to sort of make their life or </v>
<v Speaker 2>make their mark if that's a freedom that</v>

1179
00:58:57.341 --> 00:59:02.341
<v Speaker 2>they can see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about sort of trying to level a </v>

1180
00:59:02.341 --> 00:59:04.901
<v Speaker 2>baseline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we talked about how healthcare can </v>

1181
00:59:04.901 --> 00:59:04.901
<v Speaker 2>be super helpful for business and for </v>
<v Speaker 2>entrepreneurial ventures.</v>

1182
00:59:05.620 --> 00:59:08.680
<v Speaker 2>We talked about why it's essential for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the robustness of communities,</v>

1183
00:59:09.010 --> 00:59:13.240
<v Speaker 2>but it's about setting the terms under </v>
<v Speaker 2>which people can be free to make choices</v>

1184
00:59:13.241 --> 00:59:17.290
<v Speaker 2>and to perform at a level that they want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to to build their whole future.</v>

1185
00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:22.320
<v Speaker 2>So it's not that it's a shift from sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of us running ahead and and blocks for </v>

1186
00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:26.681
<v Speaker 2>people to us trying to lift the </v>
<v Speaker 2>constraint so that people can have </v>

1187
00:59:26.681 --> 00:59:28.280
<v Speaker 2>better choices for their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for their families,</v>

1188
00:59:28.310 --> 00:59:33.310
<v Speaker 2>for their kids and their education </v>
<v Speaker 2>system for their own work so that they </v>

1189
00:59:33.310 --> 00:59:35.270
<v Speaker 2>can do better and make their own mark </v>
<v Speaker 2>and because a lot of what we're standing</v>

1190
00:59:35.271 --> 00:59:40.271
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the successes that we're </v>

1191
00:59:40.271 --> 00:59:40.271
<v Speaker 2>standing on as a country are on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>shoulders of working men and women.</v>

1192
00:59:40.850 --> 00:59:45.850
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of what's accounted for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The things that we've done well and in </v>

1193
00:59:45.850 --> 00:59:45.850
<v Speaker 2>fact a lot of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>frankly.</v>

1194
00:59:45.850 --> 00:59:50.740
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the world is benefited </v>
<v Speaker 2>enormously from the working people in </v>

1195
00:59:50.740 --> 00:59:51.810
<v Speaker 2>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1196
00:59:51.811 --> 00:59:54.230
<v Speaker 2>in a way that I don't think gets nearly </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough recognition.</v>

1197
00:59:54.231 --> 00:59:54.690
<v Speaker 2>And so we</v>

1198
00:59:55.600 --> 01:00:00.600
<v Speaker 1>see the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the accruing financial success of the </v>

1199
01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:04.811
<v Speaker 1>poor around the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is happening at a very rapid rate </v>

1200
01:00:04.811 --> 01:00:08.110
<v Speaker 1>is in part a consequence of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice is made either willingly or </v>

1201
01:00:09.381 --> 01:00:12.500
<v Speaker 1>unwillingly by the American working </v>
<v Speaker 1>class over the last 30 years.</v>

1202
01:00:12.850 --> 01:00:14.180
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Working class,</v>

1203
01:00:14.181 --> 01:00:18.410
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's competition with the world has been</v>

1204
01:00:18.411 --> 01:00:22.790
<v Speaker 1>opened up at the level of the working </v>
<v Speaker 1>class first and that's been unbelievably</v>

1205
01:00:22.791 --> 01:00:27.791
<v Speaker 1>beneficial to the rest of the world and </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably a pretty good medium to </v>

1206
01:00:27.791 --> 01:00:27.791
<v Speaker 1>longterm strategy because</v>

1207
01:00:27.860 --> 01:00:32.860
<v Speaker 2>the American working class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like they have been built after the</v>

1208
01:00:33.441 --> 01:00:36.500
<v Speaker 2>winds for people around the globe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like their heroes.</v>

1209
01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:41.540
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no infantilizing of them in a </v>

1210
01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:44.951
<v Speaker 2>way that's derogatory and it's like it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>our job to make sure that they can have </v>

1211
01:00:44.951 --> 01:00:45.570
<v Speaker 2>choices for their future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they.</v>

1212
01:00:45.590 --> 01:00:50.590
<v Speaker 2>That they are free to compete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least with the same rules that </v>

1213
01:00:50.590 --> 01:00:52.460
<v Speaker 2>everybody else competes to differentiate</v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves because they've always kicked</v>

1214
01:00:53.390 --> 01:00:54.710
<v Speaker 2>mentioned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an amazing,</v>

1215
01:00:54.711 --> 01:00:59.711
<v Speaker 2>amazing workforce and they've always </v>
<v Speaker 2>done well and it's like if people are </v>

1216
01:00:59.711 --> 01:00:59.930
<v Speaker 2>complaining about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1217
01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:04.990
<v Speaker 2>entitlements,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like we can also what your </v>

1218
01:01:04.990 --> 01:01:07.331
<v Speaker 2>corporate subsidies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's not about one or the </v>

1219
01:01:07.331 --> 01:01:11.111
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about the same rules that people </v>

1220
01:01:11.111 --> 01:01:13.031
<v Speaker 2>need to differentiate themselves and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about creating more freedom for </v>

1221
01:01:13.031 --> 01:01:13.031
<v Speaker 2>them to reach their accomplishments.</v>

1222
01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:18.200
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me that the Democrats would </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a lot more success and and and also</v>

1223
01:01:19.290 --> 01:01:23.640
<v Speaker 1>be able to generate a counter narrative </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the radicals on the left if they made</v>

1224
01:01:23.641 --> 01:01:28.641
<v Speaker 1>the assumption that there's all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>good things about free market </v>

1225
01:01:28.641 --> 01:01:32.391
<v Speaker 1>capitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but crony capitalism is not one of them </v>

1226
01:01:32.391 --> 01:01:36.160
<v Speaker 1>now and that's part of your emphasis on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's call it a regulation of </v>

1227
01:01:38.041 --> 01:01:40.890
<v Speaker 1>corruption,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the free enterprise system works real</v>

1228
01:01:40.891 --> 01:01:45.891
<v Speaker 1>well except when it gets warped and </v>
<v Speaker 1>twisted and so we have to remove the </v>

1229
01:01:45.891 --> 01:01:49.311
<v Speaker 1>warping and twisting so that people do </v>
<v Speaker 1>have the opportunity to compete and to </v>

1230
01:01:49.311 --> 01:01:50.850
<v Speaker 1>cooperate as freely as possible and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's in everyone's interests,</v>

1231
01:01:51.150 --> 01:01:56.150
<v Speaker 1>including radical capitalists because to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the degree that the system is corrupt </v>

1232
01:01:56.150 --> 01:02:00.921
<v Speaker 1>and that reflects badly on the system </v>
<v Speaker 1>and produces a tremendous amount of </v>

1233
01:02:00.921 --> 01:02:00.921
<v Speaker 1>opposition towards it.</v>

1234
01:02:03.870 --> 01:02:07.030
<v Speaker 2>If you can't win fairly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing in the game?</v>

1235
01:02:07.670 --> 01:02:10.390
<v Speaker 2>Like it's to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a very tough argument.</v>

1236
01:02:10.391 --> 01:02:13.440
<v Speaker 2>That's like if you can't sign a pledge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

1237
01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:16.210
<v Speaker 2>which has been put forth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's called the disclose act.</v>

1238
01:02:16.211 --> 01:02:18.790
<v Speaker 2>There's a number of variations of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's no dark money,</v>

1239
01:02:18.990 --> 01:02:23.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a strong stance against </v>

1240
01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:25.800
<v Speaker 2>interference by hostile actors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's no voter suppression.</v>

1241
01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:30.060
<v Speaker 2>It's getting universal healthcare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>universal voter registration.</v>

1242
01:02:30.390 --> 01:02:32.940
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of stuff of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's get everybody out voting,</v>

1243
01:02:32.970 --> 01:02:35.550
<v Speaker 2>let's lift the suppression and voter </v>
<v Speaker 2>intimidation,</v>

1244
01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:40.880
<v Speaker 2>and then when fair square and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me it's like I want the right to </v>

1245
01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:43.800
<v Speaker 2>Wayne fairly and I want the right to </v>
<v Speaker 2>lose fairly if we make a better argument</v>

1246
01:02:43.801 --> 01:02:45.250
<v Speaker 2>than let's do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1247
01:02:45.270 --> 01:02:50.270
<v Speaker 2>it's also anti gerrymandering which is </v>
<v Speaker 2>really good and there's a lot of people </v>

1248
01:02:50.270 --> 01:02:53.991
<v Speaker 2>who vow to not participate in </v>
<v Speaker 2>gerrymandering and to also have it be </v>

1249
01:02:53.991 --> 01:02:56.470
<v Speaker 2>eager bipartisan committees or judges </v>
<v Speaker 2>who determine the boundaries.</v>

1250
01:02:56.910 --> 01:03:01.910
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really quite an outrage that it's </v>

1251
01:03:01.910 --> 01:03:01.910
<v Speaker 1>not bipartisan committees.</v>

1252
01:03:01.910 --> 01:03:03.380
<v Speaker 2>It's ridiculous onto,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1253
01:03:03.410 --> 01:03:08.410
<v Speaker 2>into a boxing ring and tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>telling someone that we're going to </v>

1254
01:03:08.410 --> 01:03:10.601
<v Speaker 2>fight them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they can only step in certain areas </v>

1255
01:03:10.601 --> 01:03:10.601
<v Speaker 2>that you can go anywhere and they can </v>
<v Speaker 2>only hit you with the jab,</v>

1256
01:03:10.601 --> 01:03:11.960
<v Speaker 2>but you get to use your full battery </v>
<v Speaker 2>shots.</v>

1257
01:03:11.961 --> 01:03:16.961
<v Speaker 2>It's like man up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right step into the arena if you think </v>

1258
01:03:16.961 --> 01:03:17.890
<v Speaker 2>you can wane and wind fair and square </v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's a.</v>

1259
01:03:18.070 --> 01:03:23.070
<v Speaker 2>there's a big emphasis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's not getting enough press </v>

1260
01:03:23.070 --> 01:03:26.171
<v Speaker 2>and Democrats cleaning up our side of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the aisle in a way that is accountable </v>

1261
01:03:26.571 --> 01:03:31.571
<v Speaker 2>and that is going to be clear and if </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nobody who disagree with that,</v>

1262
01:03:32.481 --> 01:03:35.540
<v Speaker 2>I believe if you're a heart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a republican and you want to,</v>

1263
01:03:35.541 --> 01:03:40.541
<v Speaker 2>when you should be aware that you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>win fairly and under the same rules and </v>

1264
01:03:40.541 --> 01:03:40.970
<v Speaker 2>that we can all agree on that.</v>

1265
01:03:41.660 --> 01:03:46.660
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it would be nice if the Democrats </v>

1266
01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:49.410
<v Speaker 1>too could help everyone figuring out </v>
<v Speaker 1>figuring out what the problems actually </v>

1267
01:03:49.410 --> 01:03:53.821
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because right now mostly what we see in </v>

1268
01:03:53.821 --> 01:03:54.640
<v Speaker 1>the media is a discussion of pseudo </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>

1269
01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.650
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'd like to see what,</v>

1270
01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:02.720
<v Speaker 1>what are the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the real challenges that </v>

1271
01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:06.271
<v Speaker 1>confront us at the moment and what are </v>
<v Speaker 1>the proper solutions to those </v>

1272
01:04:06.271 --> 01:04:06.271
<v Speaker 1>challenges?</v>

1273
01:04:06.271 --> 01:04:06.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so funny because I feel like the,</v>

1274
01:04:06.931 --> 01:04:11.931
<v Speaker 2>the racial discourse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a discourse around racism has gotten so </v>

1275
01:04:12.051 --> 01:04:15.300
<v Speaker 2>loaded and so complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1276
01:04:15.530 --> 01:04:19.400
<v Speaker 2>since president trump has is run or has </v>
<v Speaker 2>taken office and it's,</v>

1277
01:04:19.590 --> 01:04:24.590
<v Speaker 2>I feel like all sides of the issue are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is nowhere you can stop without </v>

1278
01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:27.110
<v Speaker 2>being a landline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for me it's really important to boil</v>

1279
01:04:27.111 --> 01:04:32.111
<v Speaker 2>down to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went with a program called the five </v>

1280
01:04:32.111 --> 01:04:34.910
<v Speaker 2>that goes and runs an entrepreneurial </v>
<v Speaker 2>program in the prison system and it's </v>

1281
01:04:36.860 --> 01:04:41.860
<v Speaker 2>absolutely unbelievable how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I call the prison </v>

1282
01:04:41.860 --> 01:04:44.210
<v Speaker 2>industrial complex works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the privatization of prisons.</v>

1283
01:04:44.211 --> 01:04:49.211
<v Speaker 2>And you can sidestep all the arguments </v>
<v Speaker 2>about who's doing what and who's </v>

1284
01:04:49.211 --> 01:04:50.100
<v Speaker 2>responsible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>African-Americans,</v>

1285
01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:55.360
<v Speaker 2>if you know who are up for drug charges,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the exact same drug charges as whites or</v>

1286
01:04:56.091 --> 01:04:59.280
<v Speaker 2>600 percent more likely to get like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1287
01:04:59.281 --> 01:05:01.130
<v Speaker 2>Just straight Scott.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not well,</v>

1288
01:05:01.131 --> 01:05:03.350
<v Speaker 2>they're doing more crime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no argument to be had about that</v>

1289
01:05:03.690 --> 01:05:07.190
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are certain unbelievable biases of</v>

1290
01:05:07.191 --> 01:05:08.150
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1291
01:05:08.151 --> 01:05:11.480
<v Speaker 2>African Americans and people of color </v>
<v Speaker 2>are put into prison system,</v>

1292
01:05:11.510 --> 01:05:16.510
<v Speaker 2>which profits from them and which </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing a lot of work and </v>

1293
01:05:16.510 --> 01:05:17.150
<v Speaker 2>basically you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no wages.</v>

1294
01:05:17.610 --> 01:05:18.120
<v Speaker 2>It's very</v>

1295
01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:21.030
<v Speaker 2>problematic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anybody would agree with that across the</v>

1296
01:05:21.031 --> 01:05:23.520
<v Speaker 2>spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if you look at those numbers and</v>

1297
01:05:23.521 --> 01:05:25.310
<v Speaker 2>it's patently unfair if there's one </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing</v>

1298
01:05:25.570 --> 01:05:30.570
<v Speaker 1>we need to have an intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion about drug policy that would </v>

1299
01:05:30.570 --> 01:05:30.570
<v Speaker 1>be a real scary,</v>

1300
01:05:30.850 --> 01:05:35.850
<v Speaker 2>the prison system and who exude towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the ways in which it is unfairly </v>

1301
01:05:35.850 --> 01:05:38.830
<v Speaker 2>implemented and that's a no shit major </v>
<v Speaker 2>crawl.</v>

1302
01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:43.920
<v Speaker 2>And if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you discussed the actual hardcore </v>

1303
01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:45.070
<v Speaker 2>facts and if you could boil it down to </v>
<v Speaker 2>those things,</v>

1304
01:05:45.130 --> 01:05:46.660
<v Speaker 2>no one's going to disagree with that.</v>

1305
01:05:47.290 --> 01:05:50.110
<v Speaker 1>You know what Bjorn Lomborg did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is really interesting.</v>

1306
01:05:50.111 --> 01:05:51.880
<v Speaker 1>He's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a scandinavian.</v>

1307
01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:55.270
<v Speaker 1>You used to be an environmentalist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He still is,</v>

1308
01:05:55.271 --> 01:06:00.271
<v Speaker 1>but he calls himself the skeptical </v>
<v Speaker 1>environmentalist now and I really liked </v>

1309
01:06:00.271 --> 01:06:03.121
<v Speaker 1>your Lumberg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wrote a great book called how to </v>

1310
01:06:03.121 --> 01:06:05.761
<v Speaker 1>spend $50,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million and then a few laters years </v>

1311
01:06:05.761 --> 01:06:08.790
<v Speaker 1>later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>75 billion to make the world a better </v>

1312
01:06:08.790 --> 01:06:08.790
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A book,</v>

1313
01:06:08.790 --> 01:06:11.851
<v Speaker 1>I would highly recommend it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what he did and this is really </v>

1314
01:06:11.851 --> 01:06:11.851
<v Speaker 1>nice procedural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1315
01:06:11.851 --> 01:06:14.680
<v Speaker 1>achievement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looked at the UN.</v>

1316
01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:17.140
<v Speaker 1>I hope I got the story right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a while since I,</v>

1317
01:06:17.350 --> 01:06:22.350
<v Speaker 1>since I read it over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the UN puts out a lot of development </v>

1318
01:06:22.350 --> 01:06:22.350
<v Speaker 1>goals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say like,</v>

1319
01:06:22.350 --> 01:06:24.340
<v Speaker 1>I think they have 150 development goals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

1320
01:06:24.341 --> 01:06:27.520
<v Speaker 1>And that's too many goals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't do 150 things.</v>

1321
01:06:27.770 --> 01:06:32.770
<v Speaker 1>And I worked on a UN committee for </v>
<v Speaker 1>awhile and we were trying to prioritize </v>

1322
01:06:32.770 --> 01:06:34.450
<v Speaker 1>the goals because you'd have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>prioritize things in order to accomplish</v>

1323
01:06:34.451 --> 01:06:34.600
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1324
01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:39.600
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things we discovered was </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you couldn't prioritize the goals </v>

1325
01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:42.760
<v Speaker 1>because every goal had its constituents </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were outraged if any other goal</v>

1326
01:06:42.761 --> 01:06:46.840
<v Speaker 1>was prioritized over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was a terrible thing because,</v>

1327
01:06:46.890 --> 01:06:51.890
<v Speaker 1>well that's the tragedy of the Commons </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the goal is couldn't be </v>

1328
01:06:51.890 --> 01:06:54.571
<v Speaker 1>prioritized and they couldn't be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They couldn't be accomplished </v>

1329
01:06:54.571 --> 01:06:58.260
<v Speaker 1>essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So lumberg figured out a way around </v>

1330
01:06:58.260 --> 01:06:58.260
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So his idea was this,</v>

1331
01:06:58.630 --> 01:07:03.630
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a bunch of things that need </v>

1332
01:07:03.630 --> 01:07:06.151
<v Speaker 1>to be done because there's a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems out there in the world and but </v>

1333
01:07:06.151 --> 01:07:06.760
<v Speaker 1>there's too many to simultaneously </v>
<v Speaker 1>address.</v>

1334
01:07:06.761 --> 01:07:08.470
<v Speaker 1>So we have to figure out where we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to start.</v>

1335
01:07:08.471 --> 01:07:10.780
<v Speaker 1>So what we're going to do is a cost </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefit analysis.</v>

1336
01:07:11.140 --> 01:07:16.140
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to concentrate on doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>as much good for the least amount of </v>

1337
01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:20.161
<v Speaker 1>money as we can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's going to be our initial </v>

1338
01:07:20.161 --> 01:07:20.170
<v Speaker 1>strategy because why not right?</v>

1339
01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:26.040
<v Speaker 1>Because money is a scarce resource and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it involves human labor and human </v>

1340
01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:27.010
<v Speaker 1>intelligence and all of that and so you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to waste it.</v>

1341
01:07:27.650 --> 01:07:31.210
<v Speaker 1>But he didn't believe that he would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>capable of doing the prioritization.</v>

1342
01:07:31.211 --> 01:07:34.300
<v Speaker 1>So what he did was get 10 teams of </v>
<v Speaker 1>economists together,</v>

1343
01:07:34.510 --> 01:07:36.970
<v Speaker 1>some of which were headed by world class</v>
<v Speaker 1>economist.</v>

1344
01:07:36.971 --> 01:07:41.971
<v Speaker 1>People have won Nobel Prize and he had </v>
<v Speaker 1>them organized teams and then he had </v>

1345
01:07:41.971 --> 01:07:44.710
<v Speaker 1>them go through the development goals </v>
<v Speaker 1>and prioritize them and make an economic</v>

1346
01:07:44.711 --> 01:07:49.711
<v Speaker 1>case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then you had 10 separate cases </v>

1347
01:07:49.711 --> 01:07:49.711
<v Speaker 1>and heres the rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got $50,</v>

1348
01:07:49.711 --> 01:07:52.090
<v Speaker 1>million dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can spend it on whatever you want,</v>

1349
01:07:52.091 --> 01:07:54.850
<v Speaker 1>but you have to justify it in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cost benefit analysis,</v>

1350
01:07:54.851 --> 01:07:59.851
<v Speaker 1>Naf to choose from this list,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so then he got each economist to </v>

1351
01:07:59.851 --> 01:08:03.211
<v Speaker 1>generate a list of their priorities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he averaged across the lists and </v>

1352
01:08:03.211 --> 01:08:05.470
<v Speaker 1>came up with a final list of have both </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems,</v>

1353
01:08:05.471 --> 01:08:06.550
<v Speaker 1>which is a big deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1354
01:08:06.550 --> 01:08:10.330
<v Speaker 1>Because the first issue is what are the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems that we need to solve?</v>

1355
01:08:11.350 --> 01:08:12.430
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think,</v>

1356
01:08:12.431 --> 01:08:17.431
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what politicians should be generating </v>

1357
01:08:17.431 --> 01:08:17.431
<v Speaker 1>his answers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1358
01:08:17.431 --> 01:08:17.431
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1359
01:08:17.431 --> 01:08:17.431
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not right.</v>

1360
01:08:17.431 --> 01:08:19.010
<v Speaker 1>If you're trying to solve a complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>

1361
01:08:19.130 --> 01:08:24.130
<v Speaker 1>instead of the complex problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing you want to do is </v>

1362
01:08:24.130 --> 01:08:26.471
<v Speaker 1>formulate the problems property and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you work towards towards defining what </v>

1363
01:08:26.471 --> 01:08:31.181
<v Speaker 1>the solutions might be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So be really interesting to see if we </v>

1364
01:08:31.181 --> 01:08:32.330
<v Speaker 1>could have an intelligent political </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation that would concentrate on,</v>

1365
01:08:32.570 --> 01:08:37.570
<v Speaker 1>on defining what the actual problems are</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not capitalism versus </v>

1366
01:08:37.570 --> 01:08:39.800
<v Speaker 1>socialism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a problem.</v>

1367
01:08:40.070 --> 01:08:45.070
<v Speaker 2>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone gets to scream at each other </v>

1368
01:08:45.070 --> 01:08:47.000
<v Speaker 2>and then the superior and get it </v>
<v Speaker 2>immersed and getting retweets</v>

1369
01:08:47.710 --> 01:08:49.720
<v Speaker 1>without having to know anything about </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

1370
01:08:49.860 --> 01:08:52.440
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's no actual motivation towards</v>

1371
01:08:52.441 --> 01:08:56.190
<v Speaker 2>trying to come up with solutions to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>vast majority of people who have,</v>

1372
01:08:56.220 --> 01:09:01.220
<v Speaker 2>who are dealing with real problems and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the part that pisses me off is </v>

1373
01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:04.770
<v Speaker 2>it's like it's this masturbatory venture</v>
<v Speaker 2>of discussing the overall culture and </v>

1374
01:09:04.770 --> 01:09:05.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you turn on the news,</v>

1375
01:09:05.610 --> 01:09:08.370
<v Speaker 2>it's these little sound bites of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>most,</v>

1376
01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:13.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of tabloid nature of the furthest </v>

1377
01:09:13.390 --> 01:09:16.431
<v Speaker 2>extreme sense versus nuts and bolts </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussions of what actually makes </v>

1378
01:09:16.431 --> 01:09:16.431
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>

1379
01:09:16.431 --> 01:09:16.500
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what we need to do,</v>

1380
01:09:16.980 --> 01:09:21.980
<v Speaker 1>let's say generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is we've got to figure out what the </v>

1381
01:09:21.980 --> 01:09:21.980
<v Speaker 1>problem started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>

1382
01:09:21.980 --> 01:09:25.401
<v Speaker 1>what are the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the most serious problems that </v>

1383
01:09:25.401 --> 01:09:25.590
<v Speaker 1>currently confront us as a society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be a nice start.</v>

1384
01:09:25.591 --> 01:09:30.591
<v Speaker 1>Like what are the 15 most most crucial </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems that confront us as we move </v>

1385
01:09:31.230 --> 01:09:33.810
<v Speaker 1>farther into the 21st century?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a hard.</v>

1386
01:09:33.870 --> 01:09:38.870
<v Speaker 1>That's a hard question and then I'm a </v>
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

1387
01:09:39.181 --> 01:09:39.750
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go ahead.</v>

1388
01:09:40.090 --> 01:09:41.530
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the first thing for me,</v>

1389
01:09:41.531 --> 01:09:45.160
<v Speaker 2>looking at the system as political </v>
<v Speaker 2>corruption and I'm not eating that,</v>

1390
01:09:45.161 --> 01:09:45.710
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1391
01:09:45.711 --> 01:09:47.440
<v Speaker 2>it either party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1392
01:09:47.441 --> 01:09:52.441
<v Speaker 2>I have my opinions about which party </v>
<v Speaker 2>does that more but neither one is </v>

1393
01:09:52.441 --> 01:09:54.880
<v Speaker 2>perfect and the average rating of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Congress right now is 15 percent.</v>

1394
01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:58.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>18 percent is the providing of Congress,</v>

1395
01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:00.940
<v Speaker 2>which is better or works as a slightly </v>
<v Speaker 2>about syphilis.</v>

1396
01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:06.600
<v Speaker 2>It Ain't good and if you don't believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the people in government are </v>

1397
01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:10.261
<v Speaker 2>serving your needs and are are instead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know more interested in furthering </v>

1398
01:10:10.261 --> 01:10:13.780
<v Speaker 2>the big money donors over the interests </v>
<v Speaker 2>of people which has proven time and time</v>

1399
01:10:13.781 --> 01:10:18.781
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a huge problem with trust is </v>

1400
01:10:18.781 --> 01:10:20.380
<v Speaker 2>eroded that the people representing you </v>
<v Speaker 2>are representing rich donors rather than</v>

1401
01:10:20.430 --> 01:10:22.900
<v Speaker 2>average Americans didn't seem to your </v>
<v Speaker 2>needs.</v>

1402
01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:28.080
<v Speaker 2>You can't get anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's part of what's </v>

1403
01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:28.900
<v Speaker 2>important and all those flags that </v>
<v Speaker 2>allowed Democrats are working on.</v>

1404
01:10:28.930 --> 01:10:31.450
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a pledge to say here's what we,</v>

1405
01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:36.600
<v Speaker 2>here's what we will disclose and here's </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways that we will clean up our side of </v>

1406
01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:37.750
<v Speaker 2>the island.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think if it's essential,</v>

1407
01:10:37.751 --> 01:10:41.980
<v Speaker 2>it's essential that you start with your </v>
<v Speaker 2>own reflection of fixing the things that</v>

1408
01:10:41.981 --> 01:10:43.810
<v Speaker 2>you need to fix in order to make a </v>
<v Speaker 2>better argument.</v>

1409
01:10:44.170 --> 01:10:49.170
<v Speaker 2>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>corruption and governments and top of </v>

1410
01:10:49.170 --> 01:10:49.170
<v Speaker 2>this year.</v>

1411
01:10:49.170 --> 01:10:53.330
<v Speaker 1>But go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking more of a procedurally </v>

1412
01:10:53.380 --> 01:10:58.380
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not so much in terms of what the </v>

1413
01:10:58.380 --> 01:10:58.380
<v Speaker 1>problems might be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1414
01:10:58.380 --> 01:11:01.700
<v Speaker 1>one of the problems I see emerging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well one of them would be this increase </v>

1415
01:11:01.700 --> 01:11:02.940
<v Speaker 1>in political polarization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is very,</v>

1416
01:11:02.941 --> 01:11:06.000
<v Speaker 1>very dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think another potential problem on the</v>

1417
01:11:06.001 --> 01:11:10.710
<v Speaker 1>horizon is something like as our society</v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes more cognitively complex,</v>

1418
01:11:10.711 --> 01:11:12.420
<v Speaker 1>which is happening very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very rapidly,</v>

1419
01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:17.720
<v Speaker 1>the of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the proportion of people who are likely </v>

1420
01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:17.820
<v Speaker 1>to be dispossessed as a consequence of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1421
01:11:18.390 --> 01:11:19.170
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1422
01:11:19.590 --> 01:11:24.590
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of lesser ability to deal with that kind</v>

1423
01:11:25.481 --> 01:11:27.550
<v Speaker 1>of complexity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that problem is going to increase.</v>

1424
01:11:27.610 --> 01:11:31.210
<v Speaker 1>And that's across the board and it isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>obvious what to do about that.</v>

1425
01:11:31.300 --> 01:11:36.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't really buy guaranteed basic </v>
<v Speaker 1>income solutions in part because I don't</v>

1426
01:11:36.071 --> 01:11:39.160
<v Speaker 1>think that money is actually the </v>
<v Speaker 1>solution to the problem of what to do in</v>

1427
01:11:39.161 --> 01:11:41.380
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like money can stave off,</v>

1428
01:11:41.590 --> 01:11:43.680
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>In some ways it's the opposite.</v>

1429
01:11:43.681 --> 01:11:46.700
<v Speaker 2>If you lose a goal that you're striving </v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

1430
01:11:46.850 --> 01:11:50.870
<v Speaker 2>that makes life tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Over conversation that I think should be</v>

1431
01:11:50.871 --> 01:11:55.871
<v Speaker 2>around table with Democrats and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Conservatives and Republicans to say </v>

1432
01:11:55.871 --> 01:12:00.610
<v Speaker 2>what's a furrow capitalist argument for </v>
<v Speaker 2>how we're going to train people and </v>

1433
01:12:00.610 --> 01:12:00.610
<v Speaker 2>bring them along.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1434
01:12:00.710 --> 01:12:01.340
<v Speaker 2>What's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's uh,</v>

1435
01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:01.790
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1436
01:12:02.060 --> 01:12:07.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a liberal argument for having concern </v>

1437
01:12:07.060 --> 01:12:07.060
<v Speaker 2>for people who don't have the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>advantages from the same background.</v>

1438
01:12:07.060 --> 01:12:07.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1439
01:12:07.140 --> 01:12:07.560
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1440
01:12:07.660 --> 01:12:10.770
<v Speaker 1>the silicon valley types,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tend to skew pretty heavily liberal</v>

1441
01:12:11.070 --> 01:12:13.470
<v Speaker 1>and that's because they're generally </v>
<v Speaker 1>creative and entrepreneurial,</v>

1442
01:12:13.710 --> 01:12:18.710
<v Speaker 1>but they're very rapidly building a </v>
<v Speaker 1>world in which people who are at the </v>

1443
01:12:18.710 --> 01:12:20.280
<v Speaker 1>lower end of the cognitive distribution </v>
<v Speaker 1>are going to be adrift.</v>

1444
01:12:21.260 --> 01:12:23.600
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we need to fix that from both sides.</v>

1445
01:12:23.601 --> 01:12:26.590
<v Speaker 2>So rather than saying all or nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1446
01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:28.970
<v Speaker 2>like tough lot capitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>free market,</v>

1447
01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:34.000
<v Speaker 2>forget it or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to support every single person </v>

1448
01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.691
<v Speaker 2>in every single way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That has to be the subject of </v>

1449
01:12:37.691 --> 01:12:40.361
<v Speaker 2>complicated in depth conversations with </v>
<v Speaker 2>people weighing in from a variety of </v>

1450
01:12:40.361 --> 01:12:41.540
<v Speaker 2>different political views.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just has to be in order.</v>

1451
01:12:41.541 --> 01:12:45.740
<v Speaker 2>It's so complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so complicated that we need,</v>

1452
01:12:45.741 --> 01:12:48.420
<v Speaker 2>we need opinions and brains from all </v>
<v Speaker 2>sides of the issue.</v>

1453
01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:53.560
<v Speaker 2>That's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We definitely might also need different </v>

1454
01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:53.560
<v Speaker 2>test cases,</v>

1455
01:12:54.790 --> 01:12:56.570
<v Speaker 1>those tough conversations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1456
01:12:56.571 --> 01:12:59.960
<v Speaker 1>like between someone who leans very </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberal and someone like Ben Shapiro,</v>

1457
01:13:00.230 --> 01:13:02.150
<v Speaker 1>you can think about those as stress </v>
<v Speaker 1>tests,</v>

1458
01:13:03.010 --> 01:13:08.010
<v Speaker 1>your damn stupid solution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you've put a lot of effort into </v>

1459
01:13:08.010 --> 01:13:08.010
<v Speaker 1>elaborating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

1460
01:13:08.010 --> 01:13:11.600
<v Speaker 1>can't withstand the stress of a single </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument with someone who disagrees with</v>

1461
01:13:11.601 --> 01:13:12.500
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the hell do you.</v>

1462
01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:15.140
<v Speaker 1>What makes you think that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>work when you implemented it in the real</v>

1463
01:13:15.141 --> 01:13:20.141
<v Speaker 1>world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously it's going to fail merely </v>

1464
01:13:20.141 --> 01:13:23.021
<v Speaker 1>because those people are going to object</v>
<v Speaker 1>to it independent of its objective </v>

1465
01:13:23.021 --> 01:13:26.720
<v Speaker 1>merits and so if it can't fly with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>opponents.</v>

1466
01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:31.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm not talking about the fringe </v>
<v Speaker 1>opponents because nothing flies with the</v>

1467
01:13:31.071 --> 01:13:33.560
<v Speaker 1>fringe except what the fringe beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

1468
01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:38.350
<v Speaker 2>also think that the French is overly </v>
<v Speaker 2>represented and that's what's so hard.</v>

1469
01:13:39.430 --> 01:13:43.040
<v Speaker 2>Like when mark duplass apologize for </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying people should follow Ben Shapiro,</v>

1470
01:13:43.430 --> 01:13:45.920
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was an apology he put forth.</v>

1471
01:13:46.220 --> 01:13:48.520
<v Speaker 2>I haven't worked with with with deep </v>
<v Speaker 2>loss.</v>

1472
01:13:48.790 --> 01:13:53.790
<v Speaker 2>I've heard he's a terrific guy and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think that is seen with sort of a </v>

1473
01:13:53.790 --> 01:13:53.790
<v Speaker 2>furtherance of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

1474
01:13:53.790 --> 01:13:56.570
<v Speaker 2>of an ending of polarization and </v>
<v Speaker 2>discourse.</v>

1475
01:13:57.590 --> 01:14:02.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are all those people who were </v>

1476
01:14:02.590 --> 01:14:05.801
<v Speaker 2>personally deeply wounded by him saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you should just follow somebody </v>

1477
01:14:05.801 --> 01:14:08.330
<v Speaker 2>whether you agree with him or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I also don't know who the apology is</v>

1478
01:14:08.331 --> 01:14:13.331
<v Speaker 2>geared towards like who is he </v>
<v Speaker 2>apologizing to and if we have sort of a </v>

1479
01:14:13.331 --> 01:14:17.701
<v Speaker 2>mob ditties I mean the one thing I say a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot and this is a specialist from </v>

1480
01:14:17.701 --> 01:14:21.631
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there's a huge and widening gap </v>

1481
01:14:21.631 --> 01:14:24.511
<v Speaker 2>between conversations that people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>having in public and what they really </v>

1482
01:14:24.511 --> 01:14:26.710
<v Speaker 2>believe in the sign of a creeping </v>
<v Speaker 2>totalitarianism that's really,</v>

1483
01:14:26.711 --> 01:14:29.770
<v Speaker 2>really dangerous and it's also from both</v>
<v Speaker 2>sides.</v>

1484
01:14:29.770 --> 01:14:32.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm not just saying that this is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>liberal value.</v>

1485
01:14:32.231 --> 01:14:37.231
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lot more people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>have more complicated views that they </v>

1486
01:14:37.231 --> 01:14:41.011
<v Speaker 2>don't feel safe to articulate it because</v>
<v Speaker 2>fear of complete reputation slammer </v>

1487
01:14:42.090 --> 01:14:43.050
<v Speaker 2>room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1488
01:14:43.090 --> 01:14:48.090
<v Speaker 2>Don't we'll be out of work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will be everything else and so I </v>

1489
01:14:48.090 --> 01:14:48.090
<v Speaker 2>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very interesting thing,</v>

1490
01:14:48.470 --> 01:14:53.470
<v Speaker 2>may have a lot of sympathy for people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who set out and say something and then </v>

1491
01:14:53.470 --> 01:14:58.141
<v Speaker 2>sort of retreat and apologize because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel like the force of a mod response </v>

1492
01:14:58.750 --> 01:15:03.750
<v Speaker 2>from the French,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if it's sort of pluralistic </v>

1493
01:15:03.750 --> 01:15:03.750
<v Speaker 2>ignorance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1494
01:15:03.750 --> 01:15:04.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean 90 percent of people might agree </v>
<v Speaker 2>with you,</v>

1495
01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:07.120
<v Speaker 2>but if the tanner allowed and it's all </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're seeing everywhere,</v>

1496
01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:09.370
<v Speaker 2>it has the power to reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

1497
01:15:09.570 --> 01:15:11.440
<v Speaker 2>That's on mind control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Colts function.</v>

1498
01:15:11.670 --> 01:15:16.670
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mind control is one of the first things </v>

1499
01:15:16.670 --> 01:15:16.670
<v Speaker 2>they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they can get you off through complex,</v>

1500
01:15:16.670 --> 01:15:18.610
<v Speaker 2>there's privacy and everywhere that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1501
01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:21.100
<v Speaker 2>if there's two versions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they try and split me.</v>

1502
01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:26.100
<v Speaker 2>I went undercover in a mind control </v>
<v Speaker 2>calls to research one of my calls and </v>

1503
01:15:26.100 --> 01:15:28.840
<v Speaker 2>when you're there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that I say that is cult Greg,</v>

1504
01:15:28.930 --> 01:15:32.680
<v Speaker 2>they're splitting Colt Greg from Greg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Greg and everything that I saved,</v>

1505
01:15:32.681 --> 01:15:33.940
<v Speaker 2>like wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is fun.</v>

1506
01:15:33.970 --> 01:15:38.970
<v Speaker 2>It's Sorta love bombing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone leans in its direct eye </v>

1507
01:15:38.970 --> 01:15:39.220
<v Speaker 2>contact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of nonsexual touching.</v>

1508
01:15:39.221 --> 01:15:40.660
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's engaged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if I say,</v>

1509
01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:41.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is weird,</v>

1510
01:15:41.501 --> 01:15:44.680
<v Speaker 2>I kind of miss being in contact with </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone of their friends.</v>

1511
01:15:44.710 --> 01:15:46.570
<v Speaker 2>It's the sort of windshield that </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's,</v>

1512
01:15:47.860 --> 01:15:52.860
<v Speaker 2>and it's what I think is happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but from a smaller percentage of people </v>

1513
01:15:53.830 --> 01:15:58.830
<v Speaker 2>that are really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really loud and if you see it all of a </v>

1514
01:15:58.830 --> 01:16:02.491
<v Speaker 2>sudden it seems to be the reality would </v>
<v Speaker 2>be our sort of apologies that I believe </v>

1515
01:16:03.790 --> 01:16:06.370
<v Speaker 2>when a lot of people make the apologies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they read flat.</v>

1516
01:16:06.371 --> 01:16:11.320
<v Speaker 2>To me it doesn't feel heartfelt and also</v>
<v Speaker 2>like let's say you really did screw up,</v>

1517
01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:14.350
<v Speaker 2>like part of what we need to do is screw</v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

1518
01:16:14.380 --> 01:16:19.380
<v Speaker 2>Pardon me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think about things and say things and </v>

1519
01:16:19.380 --> 01:16:19.380
<v Speaker 2>overstaffed and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1520
01:16:19.380 --> 01:16:20.040
<v Speaker 2>that was kind of his girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1521
01:16:20.380 --> 01:16:25.380
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's a blanket apology to society </v>

1522
01:16:25.380 --> 01:16:25.380
<v Speaker 2>versus the individual stuff to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1523
01:16:25.380 --> 01:16:28.990
<v Speaker 2>I forwarded this position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish I had articulated it better.</v>

1524
01:16:29.050 --> 01:16:34.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't always relate myself perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably what I should've said rather </v>

1525
01:16:34.050 --> 01:16:38.431
<v Speaker 2>than,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so sorry to have had a thought that </v>

1526
01:16:38.431 --> 01:16:39.010
<v Speaker 2>is isn't appropriate and we're seeing </v>
<v Speaker 2>this across the board.</v>

1527
01:16:39.060 --> 01:16:44.060
<v Speaker 2>I think it's really being part of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>needs to be done and this is something </v>

1528
01:16:44.060 --> 01:16:44.060
<v Speaker 2>we already talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to,</v>

1529
01:16:44.260 --> 01:16:46.840
<v Speaker 2>is to generate better dialogue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1530
01:16:46.930 --> 01:16:51.930
<v Speaker 2>It isn't like that and hope that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mere fact that it's a much higher </v>

1531
01:16:51.930 --> 01:16:54.370
<v Speaker 2>quality is sufficient to attract people </v>
<v Speaker 2>to it in a way from this other nonsense.</v>

1532
01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.010
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard because as you said,</v>

1533
01:16:57.011 --> 01:17:00.180
<v Speaker 2>the shorter the span.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I have people who that,</v>

1534
01:17:00.250 --> 01:17:03.550
<v Speaker 2>who knows that we're good friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know our work is time to tangle up.</v>

1535
01:17:03.550 --> 01:17:08.550
<v Speaker 2>We mentioned each other and our books.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've known each other shit since I was </v>

1536
01:17:08.550 --> 01:17:12.240
<v Speaker 2>20 years old and people will say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well he believes in course minority like</v>

1537
01:17:12.270 --> 01:17:15.500
<v Speaker 2>dismissed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll be one thing and it's like it's an</v>

1538
01:17:15.501 --> 01:17:20.501
<v Speaker 2>anthropological term or sociological </v>
<v Speaker 2>term with specific meeting takes one </v>

1539
01:17:21.051 --> 01:17:26.051
<v Speaker 2>google search to sort of prove that it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>not that Jordan Peterson is running </v>

1540
01:17:26.051 --> 01:17:28.060
<v Speaker 2>around like a world war two propaganda </v>
<v Speaker 2>poster,</v>

1541
01:17:28.340 --> 01:17:31.670
<v Speaker 2>like dragging ribbon off into the caves </v>
<v Speaker 2>of giving them,</v>

1542
01:17:31.671 --> 01:17:33.560
<v Speaker 2>giving them to useless men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1543
01:17:33.561 --> 01:17:35.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's so disprovable,</v>

1544
01:17:35.241 --> 01:17:40.241
<v Speaker 2>but it's also so damning on a format </v>
<v Speaker 2>like twitter where you have 280 </v>

1545
01:17:40.241 --> 01:17:44.921
<v Speaker 2>characters and so it's that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that reputation thing where like if</v>

1546
01:17:45.171 --> 01:17:48.230
<v Speaker 2>you associate with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should never be discussed again.</v>

1547
01:17:48.250 --> 01:17:51.980
<v Speaker 2>If you should follow a bunch of pure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether you agree with him or not,</v>

1548
01:17:52.380 --> 01:17:56.210
<v Speaker 2>you'll be bombarded in shamed until you </v>
<v Speaker 2>apologize for even saying that.</v>

1549
01:17:56.240 --> 01:17:57.350
<v Speaker 2>You'll do that and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1550
01:17:57.380 --> 01:18:01.910
<v Speaker 2>I've learned the most from my friends </v>
<v Speaker 2>who disagree with me the most.</v>

1551
01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:04.490
<v Speaker 2>I have a wide range of friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so funny,</v>

1552
01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:07.970
<v Speaker 2>but one of the stories that I tell after</v>
<v Speaker 2>president trump was elected.</v>

1553
01:18:07.971 --> 01:18:12.971
<v Speaker 2>I was in Vegas on a book tour and one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>my friends was a crusty old farmer and </v>

1554
01:18:12.971 --> 01:18:16.340
<v Speaker 2>sniper from the SPEC ops community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He passed away recently,</v>

1555
01:18:16.341 --> 01:18:21.341
<v Speaker 2>but he was just a great friend and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>great guy and I did a lot of shooting </v>

1556
01:18:21.601 --> 01:18:26.601
<v Speaker 2>with him for the books and then a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>research and he wanted me to see his </v>

1557
01:18:26.601 --> 01:18:29.201
<v Speaker 2>ranch and we pull up to his ranch and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>has a tank parked in his front yard and </v>

1558
01:18:29.201 --> 01:18:30.800
<v Speaker 2>sticking out of the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Out of the end of it.</v>

1559
01:18:30.890 --> 01:18:34.490
<v Speaker 2>He's a trump pence sign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So at that exact moment,</v>

1560
01:18:35.090 --> 01:18:40.090
<v Speaker 2>my wife sends me a text and it's her and</v>
<v Speaker 2>my daughter at like one of the thousand </v>

1561
01:18:41.121 --> 01:18:43.760
<v Speaker 2>women marches and they just come up on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Miley Cyrus,</v>

1562
01:18:43.761 --> 01:18:45.270
<v Speaker 2>so they're like my daughter's pose.</v>

1563
01:18:45.270 --> 01:18:48.560
<v Speaker 2>Even miley Cyrus and the tech sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes in and my buddy looks at me.</v>

1564
01:18:48.561 --> 01:18:49.580
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's that?</v>

1565
01:18:49.650 --> 01:18:51.590
<v Speaker 2>And I looked up at him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said nothing.</v>

1566
01:18:52.940 --> 01:18:57.940
<v Speaker 2>But then I showed him and we had a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>laugh about it in sort of this way that </v>

1567
01:18:58.180 --> 01:19:01.760
<v Speaker 2>it's like you need people around to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>a whole variety of things.</v>

1568
01:19:01.761 --> 01:19:06.761
<v Speaker 2>And one thing that's interesting with </v>
<v Speaker 2>him was around the time of the Muslim </v>

1569
01:19:06.761 --> 01:19:09.161
<v Speaker 2>ban.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was talking to him a lot about </v>

1570
01:19:09.161 --> 01:19:09.161
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

1571
01:19:09.161 --> 01:19:09.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm personally very posts the Muslim ban</v>

1572
01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:10.580
<v Speaker 2>for instance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's,</v>

1573
01:19:10.910 --> 01:19:14.390
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of reasons if you talk to </v>
<v Speaker 2>people in the military,</v>

1574
01:19:14.780 --> 01:19:17.450
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of problems recruiting </v>
<v Speaker 2>translators now.</v>

1575
01:19:17.510 --> 01:19:22.510
<v Speaker 2>Like that has a negative effect that </v>
<v Speaker 2>ripple through the intelligence </v>

1576
01:19:22.510 --> 01:19:22.510
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not good.</v>

1577
01:19:22.510 --> 01:19:27.340
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and whether I've friends who were </v>

1578
01:19:27.340 --> 01:19:28.640
<v Speaker 2>vehement advocates of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm arguing with them saying what is</v>

1579
01:19:28.641 --> 01:19:31.730
<v Speaker 2>the actual ground truth of how that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>affecting things.</v>

1580
01:19:31.730 --> 01:19:33.500
<v Speaker 2>And then there's all the people in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>military who were like,</v>

1581
01:19:33.530 --> 01:19:38.530
<v Speaker 2>this has been a total shit show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really hurting our intelligence </v>

1582
01:19:38.530 --> 01:19:41.771
<v Speaker 2>efforts and our allies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like that's the level of the </v>

1583
01:19:41.771 --> 01:19:42.440
<v Speaker 2>discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or one of the other things for me that's</v>

1584
01:19:42.441 --> 01:19:44.030
<v Speaker 2>very relevant is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1585
01:19:44.031 --> 01:19:47.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you know this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's 15,000</v>

1586
01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:52.040
<v Speaker 2>Muslim physicians from the seven banned </v>
<v Speaker 2>Muslim countries in America and they </v>

1587
01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:55.310
<v Speaker 2>predominantly work in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in rural red state districts.</v>

1588
01:19:55.380 --> 01:19:58.190
<v Speaker 2>They're providing the majority of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the majority of the.</v>

1589
01:19:58.191 --> 01:20:01.850
<v Speaker 2>Providing a ton of medical care to a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of people in red states.</v>

1590
01:20:01.910 --> 01:20:03.830
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are the people.</v>

1591
01:20:03.831 --> 01:20:08.831
<v Speaker 2>If they fled Aleppo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they hate Bishar Hassan and extremism </v>

1592
01:20:08.831 --> 01:20:09.150
<v Speaker 2>like this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

1593
01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:13.140
<v Speaker 2>this is exactly the sorts of people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to have in these areas.</v>

1594
01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:16.080
<v Speaker 2>And if they're pulled out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to have a lot of rural areas</v>

1595
01:20:16.081 --> 01:20:21.081
<v Speaker 2>that more affluent physicians are not </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to have access to medical care </v>

1596
01:20:22.020 --> 01:20:25.500
<v Speaker 2>because more affluent positions or </v>
<v Speaker 2>people from America don't always want to</v>

1597
01:20:25.501 --> 01:20:27.270
<v Speaker 2>go to these regions.</v>

1598
01:20:27.270 --> 01:20:29.520
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of like bigger recruiting </v>
<v Speaker 2>a physician,</v>

1599
01:20:29.521 --> 01:20:34.521
<v Speaker 2>so you have with people who are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are great sort of citizens and </v>

1600
01:20:34.521 --> 01:20:38.271
<v Speaker 2>representatives who hate extremism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are treating people in different </v>

1601
01:20:38.271 --> 01:20:38.271
<v Speaker 2>states.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

1602
01:20:38.271 --> 01:20:40.830
<v Speaker 2>that's really important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you pair that with the Intel picture</v>

1603
01:20:41.070 --> 01:20:46.070
<v Speaker 2>that I think is deeply problematic and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a sort of argument that isn't </v>

1604
01:20:46.070 --> 01:20:48.600
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should have more empathy for Muslims</v>

1605
01:20:48.620 --> 01:20:52.410
<v Speaker 2>and which then just deteriorates into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well they're terrorists and like it just</v>

1606
01:20:52.411 --> 01:20:57.411
<v Speaker 2>devolves rather looking at sort of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>temperament of the people who were here </v>

1607
01:20:57.411 --> 01:20:59.340
<v Speaker 2>and you have to have conversations with </v>
<v Speaker 2>people from all sides of the,</v>

1608
01:20:59.390 --> 01:21:04.390
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I had a lot of conversations with </v>

1609
01:21:04.390 --> 01:21:05.841
<v Speaker 2>people in the military who support it or</v>
<v Speaker 2>against it to kind of start to zero in </v>

1610
01:21:05.841 --> 01:21:07.170
<v Speaker 2>on what my position is.</v>

1611
01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:10.830
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the plan is something like this.</v>

1612
01:21:10.831 --> 01:21:13.560
<v Speaker 1>So we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've recorded this video.</v>

1613
01:21:13.830 --> 01:21:17.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to post it as a public </v>
<v Speaker 1>invitation to the intellectual dark web.</v>

1614
01:21:17.671 --> 01:21:22.671
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what I'll title it or </v>
<v Speaker 1>subtitling idea would be to bring on </v>

1615
01:21:22.950 --> 01:21:27.950
<v Speaker 1>people democrats at least to begin with </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that would sort of run counter </v>

1616
01:21:27.950 --> 01:21:32.481
<v Speaker 1>to the idw reputation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say Democrats who are capable and </v>

1617
01:21:32.911 --> 01:21:37.911
<v Speaker 1>we're capable of and willing to engage </v>
<v Speaker 1>in long form discussions about co </v>

1618
01:21:37.911 --> 01:21:40.500
<v Speaker 1>complex high resolution issues and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>provide a more,</v>

1619
01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:44.350
<v Speaker 1>at least in part a more centrist </v>
<v Speaker 1>alternative to the radical leftists,</v>

1620
01:21:44.351 --> 01:21:49.351
<v Speaker 1>but also to bring on people with more </v>
<v Speaker 1>left leaning views to have them a try </v>

1621
01:21:50.250 --> 01:21:55.250
<v Speaker 1>their arguments out in a more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a more fully fledged manner.</v>

1622
01:21:55.920 --> 01:21:56.760
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>

1623
01:21:57.130 --> 01:21:59.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean how does anyone lives,</v>

1624
01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:01.720
<v Speaker 2>like if someone's conservative not </v>
<v Speaker 2>moving,</v>

1625
01:22:01.990 --> 01:22:04.180
<v Speaker 2>they should know what the reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 2>virgin isn't.</v>

1626
01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:06.430
<v Speaker 2>The argument they're rejecting like good</v>
<v Speaker 2>for you.</v>

1627
01:22:06.431 --> 01:22:11.431
<v Speaker 2>Then you know all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're seeing his reports of like </v>

1628
01:22:11.431 --> 01:22:15.031
<v Speaker 2>students gone wild on college campuses </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the craziness that I believe I </v>

1629
01:22:15.031 --> 01:22:17.680
<v Speaker 2>believe is a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you've certainly,</v>

1630
01:22:17.681 --> 01:22:22.681
<v Speaker 2>you've dealt with protests and you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>dealt with that sort of like brutal </v>

1631
01:22:23.030 --> 01:22:26.080
<v Speaker 2>groupthink and anti first amendment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1632
01:22:26.170 --> 01:22:29.760
<v Speaker 2>like sort of shutting down speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's always tricky to talk about freedom</v>

1633
01:22:29.761 --> 01:22:32.590
<v Speaker 2>of speech and first amendment because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's unclear,</v>

1634
01:22:32.591 --> 01:22:37.591
<v Speaker 2>always wear that lapses in being legal </v>
<v Speaker 2>or constitutional versus just people </v>

1635
01:22:37.591 --> 01:22:41.610
<v Speaker 2>articulating things loudly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I have no question that that's a </v>

1636
01:22:41.610 --> 01:22:41.610
<v Speaker 2>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that there's.</v>

1637
01:22:41.610 --> 01:22:46.150
<v Speaker 2>I think that it is over represented an </v>
<v Speaker 2>amplified by the media and by both sides</v>

1638
01:22:46.151 --> 01:22:47.010
<v Speaker 2>of the media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1639
01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:52.280
<v Speaker 2>So to see her topic and I think we </v>
<v Speaker 2>should get people in who are willing to </v>

1640
01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:56.110
<v Speaker 2>have conversations that are solutioning </v>
<v Speaker 2>here so that if people realize that,</v>

1641
01:22:56.590 --> 01:22:57.400
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>

1642
01:22:57.460 --> 01:23:01.470
<v Speaker 2>part of what my interest is in sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to transcend politics and getting</v>

1643
01:23:01.471 --> 01:23:04.960
<v Speaker 2>to a place where like I don't care if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're republican or Democrat as much.</v>

1644
01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:06.820
<v Speaker 2>I care if you're offering real </v>
<v Speaker 2>solutions.</v>

1645
01:23:06.821 --> 01:23:07.250
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1646
01:23:07.251 --> 01:23:07.730
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1647
01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:11.190
<v Speaker 1>This would be to figure out what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems are,</v>

1648
01:23:11.191 --> 01:23:15.270
<v Speaker 1>to see if we can come to some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>consensus about where are the challenges</v>

1649
01:23:15.420 --> 01:23:17.040
<v Speaker 1>that confront us really lie.</v>

1650
01:23:17.590 --> 01:23:22.590
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if there's a Democrat running for </v>

1651
01:23:22.590 --> 01:23:23.980
<v Speaker 2>office who is very dark money embedded </v>
<v Speaker 2>in bold the donors,</v>

1652
01:23:23.981 --> 01:23:26.410
<v Speaker 2>and there's somebody who's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a cleaner,</v>

1653
01:23:26.530 --> 01:23:28.600
<v Speaker 2>a choice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's running,</v>

1654
01:23:28.630 --> 01:23:29.980
<v Speaker 2>who's a Republican,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1655
01:23:30.010 --> 01:23:31.490
<v Speaker 2>let's have that house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1656
01:23:31.510 --> 01:23:32.150
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

1657
01:23:32.151 --> 01:23:36.580
<v Speaker 2>this is about actually spring to figure </v>
<v Speaker 2>out solutions for,</v>

1658
01:23:36.590 --> 01:23:41.590
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for people in terms of the level of </v>

1659
01:23:41.590 --> 01:23:41.590
<v Speaker 2>discourse that we can happen to </v>
<v Speaker 2>solutions that need to be offered.</v>

1660
01:23:41.590 --> 01:23:44.050
<v Speaker 2>Because while we're here talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>all this stuff,</v>

1661
01:23:44.051 --> 01:23:46.450
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people's dealing with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of real life problems.</v>

1662
01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:52.190
<v Speaker 1>I've started to introduce you to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>number of people.</v>

1663
01:23:52.550 --> 01:23:55.540
<v Speaker 1>You've met Sam and you met Dave Rubin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1664
01:23:55.700 --> 01:23:57.560
<v Speaker 1>you met Douglas Murray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Briefly.</v>

1665
01:23:57.770 --> 01:24:00.020
<v Speaker 1>Who else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who else have I introduced you to?</v>

1666
01:24:00.860 --> 01:24:05.860
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a number of other peripheral people or </v>

1667
01:24:05.860 --> 01:24:06.900
<v Speaker 2>other crews.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think,</v>

1668
01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:07.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1669
01:24:07.591 --> 01:24:12.591
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a number of people I'd like to </v>

1670
01:24:12.591 --> 01:24:14.361
<v Speaker 2>talk to the viewpoint and the viewpoint </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is more aligned with my politics </v>

1671
01:24:15.740 --> 01:24:19.560
<v Speaker 2>represented.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we should,</v>

1672
01:24:19.590 --> 01:24:22.260
<v Speaker 2>we should keep at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that the aim for me,</v>

1673
01:24:22.261 --> 01:24:23.310
<v Speaker 2>there's a couple of aims.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1674
01:24:23.311 --> 01:24:25.740
<v Speaker 2>the aim is to sort of end polarizing </v>
<v Speaker 2>discourse,</v>

1675
01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:30.570
<v Speaker 2>raise the level of conversation that can</v>
<v Speaker 2>be had for actual solutions that we need</v>

1676
01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:35.600
<v Speaker 2>for actual people and sort of longterm </v>
<v Speaker 2>aim for me is just to,</v>

1677
01:24:36.340 --> 01:24:39.270
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to eliminate the levels of corruption in</v>

1678
01:24:39.271 --> 01:24:41.940
<v Speaker 2>the government and that's crossed the </v>
<v Speaker 2>boards either side.</v>

1679
01:24:41.941 --> 01:24:46.941
<v Speaker 2>That's a longterm aim for me is like </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's willing to sign onto the disclose </v>

1680
01:24:46.941 --> 01:24:50.721
<v Speaker 2>act,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's willing to say that they're going </v>

1681
01:24:50.721 --> 01:24:52.070
<v Speaker 2>to disclose all their donors?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone we paid for an APP who's </v>

1682
01:24:52.070 --> 01:24:53.490
<v Speaker 2>willing to not take pac money is </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual candidates.</v>

1683
01:24:53.550 --> 01:24:54.510
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1684
01:24:54.511 --> 01:24:56.490
<v Speaker 2>who's willing to stand up against </v>
<v Speaker 2>gerrymandering.</v>

1685
01:24:56.850 --> 01:25:00.910
<v Speaker 2>And that to me is party agnostic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whose on that?</v>

1686
01:25:02.570 --> 01:25:03.600
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1687
01:25:04.380 --> 01:25:08.410
<v Speaker 1>Well sounds like a plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

1688
01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:10.900
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll start.</v>

1689
01:25:11.380 --> 01:25:16.380

<v Speaker 1>I've got some people that I want you to </v>

1690

<v Speaker 1>distribution as well.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:23.640
<v Speaker 2>to meet with anyone who is reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 2>and willing to have discourse instead </v>

<v Speaker 2>the chest these?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
