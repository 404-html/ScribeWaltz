<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have a conversation with Dr</v>

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.140
<v Speaker 1>Peterson for 90 minutes and then there </v>

<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

52
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.180
<v Speaker 1>during the q and a session when you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>handed a microphone,</v>

53
00:03:34.181 --> 00:03:35.014
<v Speaker 1>please speak directly into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our viewers on youtube will appreciate </v>

54
00:03:37.721 --> 00:03:39.070
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And finally,</v>

55
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.963
<v Speaker 1>I am a moderator between Professor </v>
<v Speaker 1>Peterson in the audience but also a </v>

56
00:03:43.481 --> 00:03:45.550
<v Speaker 1>biased participant in this conversation.</v>

57
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:47.223
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

58
00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:49.940
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a relief that's all over.</v>

59
00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:53.690
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

60
00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.930
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought we would start things off with</v>

61
00:03:56.931 --> 00:03:57.764
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I assume that many in the audience are </v>

62
00:03:59.571 --> 00:04:00.404
<v Speaker 1>curious but relatively unfamiliar with </v>
<v Speaker 1>you or have heard a lot about you </v>

63
00:04:04.371 --> 00:04:06.350
<v Speaker 1>without ever reading or listening to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

64
00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:11.000
<v Speaker 1>So I thought we might start with you </v>
<v Speaker 1>introducing yourself to the audience and</v>

65
00:04:11.001 --> 00:04:11.834
<v Speaker 1>maybe telling them some of the main </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you think they might be </v>

66
00:04:14.781 --> 00:04:16.220
<v Speaker 1>interested in knowing about you.</v>

67
00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.230
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess the most relevant</v>

68
00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.760
<v Speaker 3>detail is that I spent about</v>
<v Speaker 3>15 years writing this</v>

69
00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.370
<v Speaker 3>and I worked on it about three hours a </v>
<v Speaker 3>day every day during that period of time</v>

70
00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.720
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at,</v>

71
00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:47.713
<v Speaker 3>at the same time I was finishing off my </v>
<v Speaker 3>doctorate and I started lecturing at </v>

72
00:04:51.381 --> 00:04:52.214
<v Speaker 3>Harvard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was doing that continually and </v>

73
00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.233
<v Speaker 3>thinking about it continually and </v>
<v Speaker 3>reading the material that I needed to </v>

74
00:05:00.021 --> 00:05:03.110
<v Speaker 3>read in order to write the book </v>
<v Speaker 3>continually as well.</v>

75
00:05:03.111 --> 00:05:03.944
<v Speaker 3>And</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't realize until more recently </v>

76
00:05:08.151 --> 00:05:13.151
<v Speaker 3>that what I was doing was at the heart </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the postmodern conundrum.</v>

77
00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:14.743
<v Speaker 3>I would say</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was very much obsessed by the events </v>

78
00:05:19.251 --> 00:05:22.910
<v Speaker 3>of the Cold War for reasons I don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly understand.</v>

79
00:05:22.911 --> 00:05:26.630
<v Speaker 3>I had a lot of dreams about nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 3>annihilation for years on end.</v>

80
00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:28.093
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't that uncommon to be obsessed </v>

81
00:05:29.391 --> 00:05:33.080
<v Speaker 3>by that when I grew up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean because it was a preoccupation of</v>

82
00:05:33.081 --> 00:05:35.210
<v Speaker 3>everyone who was my age.</v>

83
00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.910
<v Speaker 3>I suppose there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were lots of years,</v>

84
00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.073
<v Speaker 3>probably between 1962,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say probably in 1985 where </v>

85
00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.840
<v Speaker 3>people were pretty convinced that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>probability of a nuclear war was high,</v>

86
00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:49.940
<v Speaker 3>much higher now than,</v>
<v Speaker 3>than,</v>

87
00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:53.180
<v Speaker 3>than people considered now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

88
00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:58.820
<v Speaker 3>and I was curious about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was about why everyone wasn't obsessed</v>

89
00:05:58.821 --> 00:06:00.350
<v Speaker 3>about this all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

90
00:06:00.351 --> 00:06:01.184
<v Speaker 3>because it seemed like the fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 3>issue that to armed camps were pointing </v>

91
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:10.600
<v Speaker 3>something in excess of 25,000 hydrogen </v>
<v Speaker 3>bombs each at each other.</v>

92
00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:12.643
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't understand how anybody could </v>
<v Speaker 3>concentrate on anything other than that </v>

93
00:06:14.991 --> 00:06:17.550
<v Speaker 3>since it seems so utterly insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

94
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:24.790
<v Speaker 3>and I was curious</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was going on exactly.</v>

95
00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:27.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

96
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:28.303
<v Speaker 3>Was this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one explanation was that there's a very </v>

97
00:06:30.651 --> 00:06:34.190
<v Speaker 3>large number of ways that human beings </v>
<v Speaker 3>could organize themselves in society,</v>

98
00:06:34.191 --> 00:06:35.024
<v Speaker 3>like a large number of games that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>could hypothetically play and they're </v>

99
00:06:37.791 --> 00:06:38.624
<v Speaker 3>all equally arbitrary and then in an </v>
<v Speaker 3>equally arbitrary universe and that the </v>

100
00:06:42.351 --> 00:06:43.184
<v Speaker 3>communists had decided to play one kind </v>
<v Speaker 3>of game and the West and the western </v>

101
00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:50.960
<v Speaker 3>free market democratic types have had </v>
<v Speaker 3>decided to play another game.</v>

102
00:06:50.961 --> 00:06:51.794
<v Speaker 3>And it was all arbitrary in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so that's what I was trying to </v>

103
00:06:56.061 --> 00:06:56.894
<v Speaker 3>figure out was what the hell was going </v>
<v Speaker 3>on with this conflict and was it merely </v>

104
00:07:01.341 --> 00:07:02.174
<v Speaker 3>a battle between two hypothetically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>equally valid interpretations of the </v>

105
00:07:06.591 --> 00:07:11.330
<v Speaker 3>world drawn from a set of extraordinary </v>
<v Speaker 3>large potential interpretations,</v>

106
00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:14.720
<v Speaker 3>which I think would be essentially a </v>
<v Speaker 3>postmodernist take on it.</v>

107
00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:16.093
<v Speaker 3>And I think I went into the problem </v>
<v Speaker 3>neutrally in that I didn't think I knew </v>

108
00:07:22.551 --> 00:07:24.710
<v Speaker 3>what the answer was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

109
00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:28.610
<v Speaker 3>so lots of times when you talk to people</v>
<v Speaker 3>who think or when you talk to people who</v>

110
00:07:28.611 --> 00:07:30.800
<v Speaker 3>write,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have an idea and it's right,</v>

111
00:07:30.801 --> 00:07:33.740
<v Speaker 3>and then they write whatever they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>writing to justify the idea.</v>

112
00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:36.740
<v Speaker 3>That's how they look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's not a good way to write.</v>

113
00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:37.963
<v Speaker 3>A good way to write and think is to have</v>
<v Speaker 3>a problem and then try to solve it </v>

114
00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:43.400
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To actually solve it.</v>

115
00:07:43.401 --> 00:07:45.590
<v Speaker 3>Not to demonstrate that you're a </v>
<v Speaker 3>priority.</v>

116
00:07:45.591 --> 00:07:49.410
<v Speaker 3>Commitment is true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

117
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:54.320
<v Speaker 3>one of the signs I would say that my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a priority commitments weren't.</v>

118
00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:55.183
<v Speaker 3>The purpose for the writing was that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>walked away from that 15 year project </v>

119
00:07:58.851 --> 00:07:59.684
<v Speaker 3>with a view of the world that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely different than the view that </v>

120
00:08:03.471 --> 00:08:06.650
<v Speaker 3>I had going in and learned all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

121
00:08:06.651 --> 00:08:07.484
<v Speaker 3>especially about the role of narrative </v>
<v Speaker 3>and religious thinking in life that I </v>

122
00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:13.693
<v Speaker 3>had no idea was possible when I started </v>
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of that was a consequence of </v>

123
00:08:18.921 --> 00:08:21.300
<v Speaker 3>reading the great people who I read </v>
<v Speaker 3>deeply.</v>

124
00:08:21.301 --> 00:08:23.180
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read all,</v>

125
00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:26.220
<v Speaker 3>all the great works of Friedrich </v>
<v Speaker 3>Nietzsche.</v>

126
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:31.990
<v Speaker 3>The great works of Dostoevsky and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Tolstoy and most of us collected works.</v>

127
00:08:32.061 --> 00:08:37.061
<v Speaker 3>Everything that had been published up to</v>
<v Speaker 3>that point and a very large swath of the</v>

128
00:08:37.281 --> 00:08:40.520
<v Speaker 3>relevant clinical literature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Great Clinicians of the 20th century</v>

129
00:08:40.521 --> 00:08:43.690
<v Speaker 3>and a huge stack of neuroscience and et </v>
<v Speaker 3>Cetera,</v>

130
00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:44.563
<v Speaker 3>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I was reading constantly during </v>

131
00:08:45.711 --> 00:08:46.544
<v Speaker 3>this time and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I realized some things that I think are </v>

132
00:08:50.601 --> 00:08:53.690
<v Speaker 3>true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The communists were wrong.</v>

133
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:55.943
<v Speaker 3>They weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and not just a little bit wrong and not </v>

134
00:08:57.241 --> 00:08:58.074
<v Speaker 3>wrong in some arbitrary way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were playing a game that human </v>

135
00:09:00.391 --> 00:09:05.010
<v Speaker 3>beings cannot play without descending </v>
<v Speaker 3>into a murderous catastrophe,</v>

136
00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:09.420
<v Speaker 3>and there's something about what we've </v>
<v Speaker 3>done in the west that's correct.</v>

137
00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:11.280
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard.</v>

138
00:09:11.281 --> 00:09:15.630
<v Speaker 3>It's complicated because our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our cognitive structures,</v>

139
00:09:15.631 --> 00:09:18.840
<v Speaker 3>that's one way of thinking about it or </v>
<v Speaker 3>are socio political arrangements.</v>

140
00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:22.140
<v Speaker 3>They're actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they actually parallel one another in an</v>

141
00:09:22.141 --> 00:09:23.880
<v Speaker 3>important way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't,</v>

142
00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:29.010
<v Speaker 3>are grounded in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a strange set of axioms.</v>

143
00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:33.840
<v Speaker 3>The axioms aren't rational precisely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's more like their narrative,</v>

144
00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:36.080
<v Speaker 3>their narrative axioms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

145
00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:40.350
<v Speaker 3>their stories and the story of the West </v>
<v Speaker 3>is that the individual is sovereign over</v>

146
00:09:40.351 --> 00:09:43.890
<v Speaker 3>the group and that that's the solution </v>
<v Speaker 3>to tribalism.</v>

147
00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:45.593
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's the correct solution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now what that means metaphysically </v>

148
00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:53.010
<v Speaker 3>because it's also embedded in our </v>
<v Speaker 3>religious doctrines,</v>

149
00:09:53.011 --> 00:09:55.440
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because especially in Christianity,</v>

150
00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:57.690
<v Speaker 3>although not exclusively to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Christianity,</v>

151
00:09:57.990 --> 00:09:58.823
<v Speaker 3>the individual is sovereign,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the suffering individual is sovereign </v>

152
00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:05.610
<v Speaker 3>and there's something about that that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>true at least psychologically.</v>

153
00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:06.683
<v Speaker 3>And I don't know what that might mean </v>
<v Speaker 3>metaphysically because who the hell </v>

154
00:10:09.841 --> 00:10:11.730
<v Speaker 3>knows what anything means </v>
<v Speaker 3>metaphysically,</v>

155
00:10:11.731 --> 00:10:12.331
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

156
00:10:12.331 --> 00:10:13.830
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your knowledge runs out,</v>

157
00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:15.060
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>At some point.</v>

158
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:16.583
<v Speaker 3>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I worked all these ideas out and then I </v>

159
00:10:19.141 --> 00:10:19.974
<v Speaker 3>taught for a long time courses that were</v>
<v Speaker 3>based on the ideas and the courses were </v>

160
00:10:23.191 --> 00:10:24.024
<v Speaker 3>very impactful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say they had the same impact on </v>

161
00:10:26.641 --> 00:10:27.474
<v Speaker 3>the people that I was teaching as </v>
<v Speaker 3>walking through the material had on me </v>

162
00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:35.430
<v Speaker 3>and while it was out of that that all of</v>
<v Speaker 3>this political</v>

163
00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:38.100
<v Speaker 3>controversy arose.</v>

164
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:38.933
<v Speaker 3>I mean I was never focused on political </v>
<v Speaker 3>controversy even though I'm interested </v>

165
00:10:44.821 --> 00:10:49.110
<v Speaker 3>in politics and I thought at many points</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my life about a political career,</v>

166
00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:53.610
<v Speaker 3>I always put it aside for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychological and philosophical career I</v>

167
00:10:53.611 --> 00:10:57.260
<v Speaker 3>would say and</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

168
00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:58.133
<v Speaker 3>but things started to shift badly in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Canada over the last five years and our </v>

169
00:11:02.161 --> 00:11:02.994
<v Speaker 3>government dared to implement </v>
<v Speaker 3>legislation that compelled speech and </v>

170
00:11:08.161 --> 00:11:08.994
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that I had learned </v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was doing all this background </v>

171
00:11:10.951 --> 00:11:14.340
<v Speaker 3>investigation was that there isn't a </v>
<v Speaker 3>higher value.</v>

172
00:11:14.341 --> 00:11:18.700
<v Speaker 3>Then free speech isn't free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not the right way of thinking about</v>

173
00:11:18.701 --> 00:11:19.534
<v Speaker 3>it because it's free thought and even </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not the right way of thinking </v>

174
00:11:21.871 --> 00:11:26.340
<v Speaker 3>about it because thought is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>precursor to action in life.</v>

175
00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:27.413
<v Speaker 3>So there's no difference between free </v>
<v Speaker 3>speech and free life and I was just not </v>

176
00:11:31.441 --> 00:11:32.274
<v Speaker 3>willing to put up with restrictions on </v>
<v Speaker 3>my free life and so I made some videos </v>

177
00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:40.043
<v Speaker 3>pointing out the pathology of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>doctrine and the fact that the </v>

178
00:11:42.451 --> 00:11:44.940
<v Speaker 3>government had radically overreached </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

179
00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:48.870
<v Speaker 3>it's appropriate limits and well then </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

180
00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:51.120
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and maybe you don't know,</v>

181
00:11:51.121 --> 00:11:54.580
<v Speaker 3>but I've been involved in continual </v>
<v Speaker 3>scandal</v>

182
00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:55.443
<v Speaker 4>since for 18 months as a consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which to me as a clinician indicates </v>

183
00:12:01.061 --> 00:12:03.250
<v Speaker 4>that I got my damn diagnosis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

184
00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:05.830
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not about pronouns.</v>

185
00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:09.190
<v Speaker 4>It's about something a lot deeper than </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

186
00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:12.790
<v Speaker 4>And I stand by that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe that it's the case and I don't</v>

187
00:12:12.791 --> 00:12:15.730
<v Speaker 4>think that we would all be here tonight </v>
<v Speaker 4>if that wasn't the situation.</v>

188
00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:17.143
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

189
00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:23.900
<v Speaker 1>So I wanted my first or my next question</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be about Lafayette.</v>

190
00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:26.453
<v Speaker 1>And so I thought I would read a couple </v>
<v Speaker 1>of facebook posts that certain students </v>

191
00:12:31.561 --> 00:12:32.394
<v Speaker 1>who are critical of you read in the lead</v>
<v Speaker 1>up to this event and just ask you to </v>

192
00:12:35.431 --> 00:12:36.264
<v Speaker 1>respond to them.</v>

193
00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:40.780
<v Speaker 1>So this is a student writing Lafayette </v>
<v Speaker 1>College.</v>

194
00:12:40.781 --> 00:12:41.614
<v Speaker 1>I'm utterly disappointed that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowing this to take place on our </v>

195
00:12:43.841 --> 00:12:44.674
<v Speaker 1>campus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought we went through this last </v>

196
00:12:46.091 --> 00:12:46.924
<v Speaker 1>semester with roaming millennial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inviting hateful speakers who make </v>

197
00:12:50.231 --> 00:12:51.064
<v Speaker 1>wildly unsubstantiated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Claims is not going to fly with the </v>

198
00:12:53.501 --> 00:12:55.300
<v Speaker 1>student body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

199
00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:56.313
<v Speaker 1>The middle series events are private and</v>
<v Speaker 1>not endorsed by the college that you </v>

200
00:12:59.381 --> 00:13:02.110
<v Speaker 1>absolutely have the power to make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>statement on this,</v>

201
00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:05.200
<v Speaker 1>the fact that you're not as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>embarrassment to our community.</v>

202
00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:06.303
<v Speaker 1>If you believe that this man is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>legitimate source of knowledge because </v>

203
00:13:09.761 --> 00:13:10.594
<v Speaker 1>he has a degree in clinical psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel free to ask our psychology </v>

204
00:13:14.021 --> 00:13:18.610
<v Speaker 1>department faculty in Counseling Center </v>
<v Speaker 1>staff about the validity of his claims.</v>

205
00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:21.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm certain they would not endorse this </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaker.</v>

206
00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:25.900
<v Speaker 1>Do better in all caps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For those of you unfamiliar,</v>

207
00:13:25.901 --> 00:13:29.110
<v Speaker 1>Jordan Peterson is known for denouncing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the me too.</v>

208
00:13:29.111 --> 00:13:29.944
<v Speaker 1>Movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>claiming that women are in no way </v>

209
00:13:31.721 --> 00:13:32.554
<v Speaker 1>marginalized in the west,</v>
<v Speaker 1>arguing against the existence of gender </v>

210
00:13:35.921 --> 00:13:36.754
<v Speaker 1>neutral pronouns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>arguing against gun control in the US </v>

211
00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:41.013
<v Speaker 1>and claiming that identity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>politics and social justice movements </v>

212
00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:46.300
<v Speaker 1>are part of a devious Marxist agenda.</v>

213
00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:49.120
<v Speaker 1>And then another student responded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is briefer,</v>

214
00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:50.583
<v Speaker 1>college conservatives know that if they </v>
<v Speaker 1>bring in a speaker who was willing to </v>

215
00:13:53.591 --> 00:13:54.424
<v Speaker 1>blatantly insult a portion of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience and the libs get angry enough </v>

216
00:13:58.121 --> 00:14:01.780
<v Speaker 1>about this for good reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they may get an op ed written about</v>

217
00:14:01.781 --> 00:14:04.180
<v Speaker 1>them in the New York Times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a result,</v>

218
00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:07.810
<v Speaker 1>there are a whole group of hacks like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Milo and Peterson,</v>

219
00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:12.130
<v Speaker 1>who get famous and invited purely for </v>
<v Speaker 1>their promise to Miss Gender,</v>

220
00:14:12.131 --> 00:14:16.960
<v Speaker 1>trans students and advocate provocative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but ultimately toothless arguments about</v>

221
00:14:16.961 --> 00:14:17.794
<v Speaker 1>social darwinist race theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying is that you have every </v>

222
00:14:21.341 --> 00:14:24.640
<v Speaker 1>right to be pissed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jordan Peterson as a harmful moron,</v>

223
00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:25.743
<v Speaker 1>but know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but know that you being pissed is also </v>

224
00:14:29.441 --> 00:14:32.260
<v Speaker 1>100 percent at the point of why he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>invited.</v>

225
00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:33.243
<v Speaker 1>He's not a conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just a guy who's mildly racist </v>

226
00:14:35.981 --> 00:14:36.814
<v Speaker 1>enough to offend the college liberals </v>
<v Speaker 1>and therefore secure winds for the </v>

227
00:14:40.571 --> 00:14:41.404
<v Speaker 1>cultural right</v>

228
00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:51.910
<v Speaker 4>comparatively mild stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the chattering buzz</v>

229
00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.233
<v Speaker 3>of ideologically possessed by demons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there's nothing in it that's not </v>

230
00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:01.000
<v Speaker 3>entirely predictable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>

231
00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:01.863
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the things you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you notice when you're talking to </v>

232
00:15:03.711 --> 00:15:04.544
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you.</v>

233
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:05.533
<v Speaker 3>If you want to find out whether the </v>
<v Speaker 3>person is there or the ideology is </v>

234
00:15:08.421 --> 00:15:09.254
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you listen to see if you're hearing </v>

235
00:15:11.481 --> 00:15:15.410
<v Speaker 3>anything that someone else have the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>ideological mindset.</v>

236
00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.420
<v Speaker 3>Couldn't have told you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

237
00:15:17.421 --> 00:15:18.254
<v Speaker 3>like I've had thousands of conversations</v>
<v Speaker 3>with people because I've spent 20 years </v>

238
00:15:21.321 --> 00:15:22.154
<v Speaker 3>as a clinical psychologist and one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the things I've learned about people is </v>

239
00:15:24.621 --> 00:15:25.454
<v Speaker 3>that there are unbelievably interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you get someone to sit down and you </v>

240
00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:33.500
<v Speaker 3>move past the superficial,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which you can actually do quite rapidly.</v>

241
00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:34.573
<v Speaker 3>They'll tell you all sorts of things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that only they know that are </v>

242
00:15:37.641 --> 00:15:38.474
<v Speaker 3>unbelievably enlightening and about </v>
<v Speaker 3>their own peculiar problems about the </v>

243
00:15:42.291 --> 00:15:47.150
<v Speaker 3>way they look at the world about their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their idiosyncratic familial dynamics.</v>

244
00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:51.680
<v Speaker 3>Like just fascinating personal stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the stuff of great novels,</v>

245
00:15:51.681 --> 00:15:52.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and just,</v>

246
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:53.263
<v Speaker 3>and this is ordinary people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't really think there is an </v>

247
00:15:56.121 --> 00:16:00.500
<v Speaker 3>ordinary person exactly there the facade</v>
<v Speaker 3>of ordinariness,</v>

248
00:16:00.501 --> 00:16:03.530
<v Speaker 3>but behind that people are very rarely </v>
<v Speaker 3>ordinary.</v>

249
00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:04.663
<v Speaker 3>And so their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the conversations are almost </v>

250
00:16:06.381 --> 00:16:08.690
<v Speaker 3>instantaneously fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the.</v>

251
00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:12.890
<v Speaker 3>One of the guidelines that I used in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>clinical practice constantly was like,</v>

252
00:16:12.891 --> 00:16:16.100
<v Speaker 3>I had this sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I probably learned this mostly from Carl</v>

253
00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:16.933
<v Speaker 3>Rogers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was that if the conversation wasn't </v>

254
00:16:18.501 --> 00:16:19.334
<v Speaker 3>really interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then we weren't doing anything that was </v>

255
00:16:21.561 --> 00:16:24.530
<v Speaker 3>therapeutically useful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the interesting,</v>

256
00:16:24.531 --> 00:16:27.410
<v Speaker 3>all of the interesting elements of it </v>
<v Speaker 3>were were very,</v>

257
00:16:27.411 --> 00:16:28.244
<v Speaker 3>very personal and so to replace this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I learned this mostly from so from </v>

258
00:16:32.481 --> 00:16:35.240
<v Speaker 3>Alexander,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Solzhenitsyn in his detailed analysis of</v>

259
00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:37.310
<v Speaker 3>what I would call ideological </v>
<v Speaker 3>possession.</v>

260
00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:38.983
<v Speaker 3>He talked to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He talked about people he met in the </v>

261
00:16:40.881 --> 00:16:45.881
<v Speaker 3>Gulag camps who are under the sway of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>rigid communist Orthodoxy and noted very</v>

262
00:16:47.571 --> 00:16:51.170
<v Speaker 3>clearly that it was like there was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>crank in some sense on the side of their</v>

263
00:16:51.171 --> 00:16:56.171
<v Speaker 3>hand and you could just crank the crank </v>
<v Speaker 3>and out would come the ideological dogma</v>

264
00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:57.823
<v Speaker 3>and it's all entirely predictable and </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who are in a situation like that </v>

265
00:17:00.951 --> 00:17:03.650
<v Speaker 3>don't understand that they're possessed </v>
<v Speaker 3>by an idea.</v>

266
00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:05.060
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's Carl Jung said,</v>

267
00:17:05.061 --> 00:17:05.894
<v Speaker 3>people don't have ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ideas have people and it's like so </v>

268
00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:10.903
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing in that that's anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>other than exactly what you would </v>

269
00:17:13.911 --> 00:17:16.250
<v Speaker 3>predict,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then there's a deeper issue too,</v>

270
00:17:16.251 --> 00:17:17.084
<v Speaker 3>and this is one that I think has </v>
<v Speaker 3>bedeviled me ever since I made my </v>

271
00:17:20.031 --> 00:17:21.290
<v Speaker 3>initial videos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is</v>

272
00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:24.223
<v Speaker 3>the route it's impossible for those on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the radical left to admit that anyone </v>

273
00:17:27.921 --> 00:17:28.754
<v Speaker 3>who opposes what they're doing might be </v>
<v Speaker 3>reasonable because what that would mean </v>

274
00:17:32.511 --> 00:17:33.344
<v Speaker 3>would be that you could be reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 3>and oppose the radical left and that </v>

275
00:17:35.991 --> 00:17:39.590
<v Speaker 3>would imply that what the radical left </v>
<v Speaker 3>was doing wasn't reasonable.</v>

276
00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:40.723
<v Speaker 3>And so instead of dealing with the fact </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I actually happened to be quite </v>

277
00:17:43.551 --> 00:17:48.551
<v Speaker 3>reasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the attempt is to assume that anyone who</v>

278
00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:51.600
<v Speaker 3>objects must be part of the radical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

279
00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:54.000
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well actually no.</v>

280
00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:58.590
<v Speaker 3>There's lots of space between the </v>
<v Speaker 3>radical left and the radical right.</v>

281
00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:01.650
<v Speaker 3>There's the moderate reasonable left for</v>
<v Speaker 3>example,</v>

282
00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:02.633
<v Speaker 3>and you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's the center and then </v>

283
00:18:03.871 --> 00:18:05.640
<v Speaker 3>there's the moderate reasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

284
00:18:05.641 --> 00:18:08.220
<v Speaker 3>And then there's the far right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then there's the extreme right.</v>

285
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:11.280
<v Speaker 3>All of that exists in opposition to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>radical left,</v>

286
00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:14.070
<v Speaker 3>but it's very convenient for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>radicals on the left to say,</v>

287
00:18:14.071 --> 00:18:16.690
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well you don't buy our doctrine,</v>

288
00:18:16.691 --> 00:18:17.524
<v Speaker 3>and and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then to immediately make the </v>

289
00:18:20.551 --> 00:18:25.290
<v Speaker 3>presupposition that you must be the most</v>
<v Speaker 3>highness example of that entire array of</v>

290
00:18:25.291 --> 00:18:27.390
<v Speaker 3>potential objection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

291
00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:28.403
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

292
00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:29.760
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

293
00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:34.970
<v Speaker 3>it's just not a viable stance and so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's convenient and it,</v>

294
00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:38.310
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

295
00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:41.160
<v Speaker 3>it's a bad thing because it drives </v>
<v Speaker 3>polarization.</v>

296
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:43.530
<v Speaker 3>Now it's a bad thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it also,</v>

297
00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:44.573
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't address the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So one of the things that I've been </v>

298
00:18:48.241 --> 00:18:51.570
<v Speaker 3>thinking about deeply over the last </v>
<v Speaker 3>couple of weeks and plan to write about,</v>

299
00:18:51.571 --> 00:18:53.190
<v Speaker 3>here's a mystery for all of you.</v>

300
00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:55.560
<v Speaker 3>I don't care what your political </v>
<v Speaker 3>background isn't.</v>

301
00:18:55.830 --> 00:19:00.830
<v Speaker 3>It isn't like I'm anti left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've made videos documenting this.</v>

302
00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:02.093
<v Speaker 3>I know why there's a left wing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a left wing because inequality </v>

303
00:19:04.651 --> 00:19:05.484
<v Speaker 3>is a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a way worse problem than the </v>

304
00:19:07.351 --> 00:19:08.184
<v Speaker 3>radical leftists liked to admit because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't lay it at the feet of </v>

305
00:19:10.891 --> 00:19:11.724
<v Speaker 3>capitalism and the free market </v>
<v Speaker 3>inequality is a way worse problem than </v>

306
00:19:14.761 --> 00:19:16.830
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's definitely a problem.</v>

307
00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:20.040
<v Speaker 3>And because inequality is a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need part of the political structure</v>

308
00:19:20.041 --> 00:19:20.874
<v Speaker 3>to speak up to the for the people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>end up a raid at the bottom of </v>

309
00:19:24.181 --> 00:19:26.310
<v Speaker 3>hierarchies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's crucial.</v>

310
00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:29.550
<v Speaker 3>Someone has to speak for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the place of the left.</v>

311
00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:31.133
<v Speaker 3>But then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then consider this kit so we can </v>

312
00:19:33.151 --> 00:19:33.984
<v Speaker 3>get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can state that the right speaks for </v>

313
00:19:35.521 --> 00:19:36.354
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy and the left speaks on behalf </v>
<v Speaker 3>of those who are oppressed by </v>

314
00:19:38.851 --> 00:19:39.600
<v Speaker 3>inequality.</v>

315
00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:41.190
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need that dialogue.</v>

316
00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:44.520
<v Speaker 3>The radical left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

317
00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:49.320
<v Speaker 3>We know from 20th century history that </v>
<v Speaker 3>things can go too far on the right.</v>

318
00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:52.830
<v Speaker 3>No one disputes that and that things can</v>
<v Speaker 3>go too far on the left.</v>

319
00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:55.560
<v Speaker 3>And we also know that when things go too</v>
<v Speaker 3>far,</v>

320
00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:58.260
<v Speaker 3>it's seriously not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

321
00:19:58.410 --> 00:20:00.630
<v Speaker 3>So when things went too far on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

322
00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:03.660
<v Speaker 3>then we had 120 million people die in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Second World War.</v>

323
00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:05.610
<v Speaker 3>And when things went too far on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>left,</v>

324
00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:06.563
<v Speaker 3>we had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God only knows how many people murdered </v>

325
00:20:09.151 --> 00:20:12.540
<v Speaker 3>as a consequence of internal repression.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At least $100,</v>

326
00:20:12.541 --> 00:20:15.030
<v Speaker 3>million.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we risk putting the entire planet.</v>

327
00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:19.680
<v Speaker 3>We risk putting the planet into flames.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

328
00:20:19.681 --> 00:20:22.490
<v Speaker 3>so that's the consequence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alright,</v>

329
00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:23.423
<v Speaker 3>so now in the aftermath of World War II,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say we've come to some sort of </v>

330
00:20:26.671 --> 00:20:27.504
<v Speaker 3>sociological agreement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say that you can identify the </v>

331
00:20:29.641 --> 00:20:30.474
<v Speaker 3>radical right wingers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When people make claims of racial </v>

332
00:20:32.851 --> 00:20:35.640
<v Speaker 3>superiority,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you put them in a box and you say,</v>

333
00:20:35.641 --> 00:20:36.474
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're outside of acceptable political </v>

334
00:20:37.411 --> 00:20:40.500
<v Speaker 3>discourse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so you saw that with William William</v>

335
00:20:40.501 --> 00:20:43.410
<v Speaker 3>f Buckley in the sixties when he started</v>
<v Speaker 3>his conservative review,</v>

336
00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:44.363
<v Speaker 3>he disassociated himself from the David </v>
<v Speaker 3>Duke types and you saw it more recently </v>

337
00:20:46.801 --> 00:20:48.070
<v Speaker 3>with people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

338
00:20:48.071 --> 00:20:48.904
<v Speaker 3>like Ben Shapiro,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who immediately distanced himself from </v>

339
00:20:50.591 --> 00:20:51.670
<v Speaker 3>the Charlottesville types.</v>

340
00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:53.350
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so now we,</v>

341
00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:54.303
<v Speaker 3>we kind of have a sense of where you've </v>
<v Speaker 3>crossed the damn line in your ethno </v>

342
00:20:58.031 --> 00:20:59.350
<v Speaker 3>nationalism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

343
00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:02.200
<v Speaker 3>As soon as you move into the racial </v>
<v Speaker 3>superiority domain,</v>

344
00:21:02.201 --> 00:21:04.210
<v Speaker 3>ethnic superiority domain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's flight.</v>

345
00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:06.790
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got to be dangerous.</v>

346
00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:08.560
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's a question.</v>

347
00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:11.800
<v Speaker 3>Where the hell do you across the line on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the left?</v>

348
00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:14.770
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

349
00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:16.690
<v Speaker 3>the answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows?</v>

350
00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:18.520
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not a very good answer.</v>

351
00:21:18.521 --> 00:21:19.354
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't say it's incumbent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's incumbent on people in the center </v>

352
00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:26.140
<v Speaker 3>and in the moderate left to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

353
00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:28.443
<v Speaker 3>things can go too far on the left and </v>
<v Speaker 3>here's how we know that's happened and </v>

354
00:21:32.141 --> 00:21:36.040
<v Speaker 3>that hasn't happened at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I think there's a reason for that.</v>

355
00:21:36.041 --> 00:21:36.874
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a technical reason as </v>
<v Speaker 3>well as a motivational reason to </v>

356
00:21:39.941 --> 00:21:40.774
<v Speaker 3>technical reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's harder for people on the left to </v>

357
00:21:42.971 --> 00:21:47.890
<v Speaker 3>draw boundaries because people on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>left aren't boundary drawing types,</v>

358
00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:51.070
<v Speaker 3>their boundary dissolving types,</v>
<v Speaker 3>temperamentally speaking,</v>

359
00:21:51.071 --> 00:21:51.940
<v Speaker 3>so that's a problem.</v>

360
00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:56.830
<v Speaker 3>The second problem is it doesn't look to</v>
<v Speaker 3>me like there is a smoking pistol on the</v>

361
00:21:56.831 --> 00:21:57.664
<v Speaker 3>left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's as obvious as racial superiority </v>

362
00:21:59.261 --> 00:22:00.580
<v Speaker 3>doctrines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

363
00:22:00.581 --> 00:22:01.414
<v Speaker 3>it's like they're in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of push for this </v>

364
00:22:03.731 --> 00:22:06.730
<v Speaker 3>triumvirate of of radical ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>diversity,</v>

365
00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:09.640
<v Speaker 3>inclusivity and equity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which diversity.</v>

366
00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:10.121
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

367
00:22:10.121 --> 00:22:12.550
<v Speaker 3>who's against that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like being against poverty.</v>

368
00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:13.960
<v Speaker 3>Inclusivity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

369
00:22:13.961 --> 00:22:14.794
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course we want people included </v>

370
00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:17.493
<v Speaker 3>equity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a more bitter pill to swallow </v>

371
00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:23.080
<v Speaker 3>because that's equality of outcome and </v>
<v Speaker 3>for me that's a marker.</v>

372
00:22:23.081 --> 00:22:25.330
<v Speaker 3>It's like if you're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>equality of outcome,</v>

373
00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:29.920
<v Speaker 3>you've gone too far and if you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about diversity,</v>

374
00:22:29.921 --> 00:22:33.400
<v Speaker 3>inclusivity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and equality of outcome equity,</v>

375
00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:36.310
<v Speaker 3>then you've gone too far and you might </v>
<v Speaker 3>disagree.</v>

376
00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:37.840
<v Speaker 3>You might disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fine.</v>

377
00:22:37.841 --> 00:22:38.674
<v Speaker 3>Disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If that isn't the marker for going too </v>

378
00:22:40.751 --> 00:22:43.690
<v Speaker 3>far,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then what's the marker?</v>

379
00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:48.670
<v Speaker 3>Because obviously you can go too far and</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously that's not good,</v>

380
00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:49.743
<v Speaker 3>and to close on that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would also say to the people on the </v>

381
00:22:52.061 --> 00:22:52.894
<v Speaker 3>moderate left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you want your doctrines to have </v>

382
00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:59.230
<v Speaker 3>purchase and to continue to speak for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

383
00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:03.430
<v Speaker 3>for those who stack up at the bottom of </v>
<v Speaker 3>inevitable hierarchies,</v>

384
00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:04.533
<v Speaker 3>then you owe it to yourself to </v>
<v Speaker 3>dissociate yourself from the dangerous </v>

385
00:23:07.961 --> 00:23:08.794
<v Speaker 3>radicals because otherwise they </v>
<v Speaker 3>invalidate your ideas and that doesn't </v>

386
00:23:12.731 --> 00:23:13.420
<v Speaker 3>seem to be.</v>

387
00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:16.180
<v Speaker 3>You'd think the Democrats might've </v>
<v Speaker 3>learned that in the last election,</v>

388
00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:19.840
<v Speaker 3>but they haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They haven't learned that so</v>

389
00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:23.033
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's my spiel about those comments </v>

390
00:23:24.911 --> 00:23:28.330
<v Speaker 3>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

391
00:23:28.331 --> 00:23:33.100
<v Speaker 3>so you've changed the lives of many </v>
<v Speaker 3>young people and adults in this country,</v>

392
00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:34.960
<v Speaker 3>in the anglosphere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the west,</v>

393
00:23:34.961 --> 00:23:37.240
<v Speaker 3>in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a massive following.</v>

394
00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:40.840
<v Speaker 3>My girlfriend's parents call you uncle </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jordan for example.</v>

395
00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:42.873
<v Speaker 3>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is just a that tons of people </v>

396
00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:46.010
<v Speaker 3>on the left as</v>

397
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:50.480
<v Speaker 1>we've just seen because of your power </v>
<v Speaker 1>and also your frontal attack on a lot of</v>

398
00:23:50.481 --> 00:23:53.960
<v Speaker 1>their views,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hate you and viciously caricature you.</v>

399
00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:58.490
<v Speaker 1>Then there are these other figures like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jonathan Heit and Robbie George.</v>

400
00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:02.090
<v Speaker 1>They have a lot in common with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are respected academics.</v>

401
00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:05.450
<v Speaker 1>They are at least relatively well known </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside academia.</v>

402
00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:09.710
<v Speaker 1>They share your critiques of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>humanities of student activists,</v>

403
00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:10.693
<v Speaker 1>have trends in western culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have nearly the following </v>

404
00:24:13.431 --> 00:24:14.264
<v Speaker 1>that you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they also aren't as hated or </v>

405
00:24:16.251 --> 00:24:18.740
<v Speaker 1>viciously caricatured.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moreover,</v>

406
00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:23.540
<v Speaker 1>they may have changed the minds of more </v>
<v Speaker 1>people on college campuses.</v>

407
00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:24.553
<v Speaker 1>That is people on campuses who have some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sympathy for left activists or who may </v>

408
00:24:28.821 --> 00:24:29.654
<v Speaker 1>agree with much of what you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but react negatively to confrontation </v>

409
00:24:32.511 --> 00:24:35.900
<v Speaker 1>and harsh criticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Height has appealed the such individuals</v>

410
00:24:35.901 --> 00:24:40.580
<v Speaker 1>by taking the Dale Carnegie Win friends </v>
<v Speaker 1>and influence people approach.</v>

411
00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:44.300
<v Speaker 1>So my questions are first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you agree with this dichotomy?</v>

412
00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:47.720
<v Speaker 1>Second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you consciously choose one path over</v>

413
00:24:47.721 --> 00:24:48.680
<v Speaker 1>the other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if so,</v>

414
00:24:48.681 --> 00:24:49.514
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

415
00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:52.970
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean with the height,</v>

416
00:24:52.971 --> 00:24:53.804
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was more power to them as far as I'm </v>

417
00:24:55.311 --> 00:24:56.180
<v Speaker 4>concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

418
00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:58.250
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he has a different temperament than me.</v>

419
00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:01.220
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's more introverted,</v>

420
00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:05.600
<v Speaker 4>he's less volatile,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say he's probably more agreeable</v>

421
00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:08.180
<v Speaker 4>or more polite anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

422
00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:10.880
<v Speaker 4>and I think that what he's doing is </v>
<v Speaker 4>extremely effective,</v>

423
00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:11.743
<v Speaker 4>especially from the perspective of very </v>
<v Speaker 4>carefully documenting the empirical </v>

424
00:25:16.371 --> 00:25:19.510
<v Speaker 4>facts about the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ideological,</v>

425
00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:22.053
<v Speaker 4>ideological,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the increasingly left-leaning </v>

426
00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:24.803
<v Speaker 4>ideological tilt of campuses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is something that needs to be </v>

427
00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:29.480
<v Speaker 4>explored on empirical grounds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

428
00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:32.720
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so like I said,</v>

429
00:25:32.721 --> 00:25:36.590
<v Speaker 4>more power to him and there's nothing </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrong with being reasonable guess.</v>

430
00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:41.090
<v Speaker 4>And then you asked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

431
00:25:41.091 --> 00:25:43.580
<v Speaker 4>is that the right pathway for me?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

432
00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:47.860
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>apparently not a.</v>

433
00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:54.540
<v Speaker 4>What happened when I made my initial </v>
<v Speaker 4>videos was that know I had,</v>

434
00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:58.010
<v Speaker 4>I had spoke,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I talked to people a lot.</v>

435
00:25:58.011 --> 00:25:58.844
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've worked with people a lot about </v>

436
00:25:59.731 --> 00:26:00.564
<v Speaker 4>negotiation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's one of the things that I </v>

437
00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:03.173
<v Speaker 4>specialized in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say in my clinical and </v>

438
00:26:04.321 --> 00:26:06.900
<v Speaker 4>consulting practice was teaching people </v>
<v Speaker 4>how to negotiate.</v>

439
00:26:06.901 --> 00:26:07.734
<v Speaker 4>And I can tell you some things about </v>
<v Speaker 4>negotiating that you might find </v>

440
00:26:09.991 --> 00:26:10.824
<v Speaker 4>interesting and useful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The first is you can't negotiate from a </v>

441
00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:14.483
<v Speaker 4>position of weakness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So all of you who are going to be </v>

442
00:26:15.991 --> 00:26:16.824
<v Speaker 4>developing your careers in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you need to understand that if you want </v>

443
00:26:19.671 --> 00:26:21.900
<v Speaker 4>to push your career forward,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well first of all,</v>

444
00:26:21.901 --> 00:26:24.540
<v Speaker 4>that you do in fact have to push it </v>
<v Speaker 4>forward.</v>

445
00:26:24.541 --> 00:26:29.541
<v Speaker 4>Because if you're competent and silent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you will be ignored.</v>

446
00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:31.393
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know that's rough because you </v>

447
00:26:32.671 --> 00:26:33.331
<v Speaker 4>might think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

448
00:26:33.331 --> 00:26:35.460
<v Speaker 4>people should reward you because you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>competent,</v>

449
00:26:35.461 --> 00:26:37.470
<v Speaker 4>and yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course they should,</v>

450
00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:40.290
<v Speaker 4>but if you're competent and silent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you're just not.</v>

451
00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:43.020
<v Speaker 4>You're not a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're just part of the.</v>

452
00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:44.130
<v Speaker 4>That's keeping</v>

453
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:44.963
<v Speaker 3>everything functioning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so if you want to develop your </v>

454
00:26:46.801 --> 00:26:47.634
<v Speaker 3>career in terms of promotions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say and salary is like you have to be </v>

455
00:26:50.911 --> 00:26:54.840
<v Speaker 3>competent and you have to be strategic </v>
<v Speaker 3>and to be strategic,</v>

456
00:26:54.841 --> 00:26:57.750
<v Speaker 3>when you negotiate for a new position or</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a new salary,</v>

457
00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:01.890
<v Speaker 3>you have to be able to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't give me what I want,</v>

458
00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:05.400
<v Speaker 3>then something you don't like will </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen to you.</v>

459
00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:08.160
<v Speaker 3>And what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a physical threat,</v>

460
00:27:08.161 --> 00:27:09.990
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's that you have an option,</v>

461
00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:12.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you have your CV,</v>

462
00:27:12.451 --> 00:27:14.340
<v Speaker 3>your resume in order,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

463
00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:15.443
<v Speaker 3>You're educated and competent and </v>
<v Speaker 3>desirable to people outside of your </v>

464
00:27:18.091 --> 00:27:21.520
<v Speaker 3>immediate job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're willing to instantly put yourself</v>

465
00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:25.590
<v Speaker 3>in the job market and undergo the stress</v>
<v Speaker 3>of finding a new position and undergoing</v>

466
00:27:25.591 --> 00:27:26.424
<v Speaker 3>interviews and all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you have that all planned out so </v>

467
00:27:29.101 --> 00:27:31.800
<v Speaker 3>that when you go talk to the person that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're negotiating with,</v>

468
00:27:31.801 --> 00:27:32.634
<v Speaker 3>with regards to your salary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're credible and they see because </v>

469
00:27:35.281 --> 00:27:35.880
<v Speaker 3>they.</v>

470
00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:36.713
<v Speaker 3>It's very seldom that you're talking to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the person who's at the top of the </v>

471
00:27:38.791 --> 00:27:40.440
<v Speaker 3>pecking order.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say.</v>

472
00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:41.663
<v Speaker 3>What you need to do that with them is to</v>
<v Speaker 3>tell them a story that they can tell to </v>

473
00:27:44.641 --> 00:27:49.620
<v Speaker 3>their boss to make you not a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one a good story is,</v>

474
00:27:49.621 --> 00:27:50.454
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we really need this person because </v>

475
00:27:51.031 --> 00:27:53.100
<v Speaker 3>they're hyper competent and they have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>better offer.</v>

476
00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:54.001
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

477
00:27:54.001 --> 00:27:55.650
<v Speaker 3>then you're going to win the </v>
<v Speaker 3>negotiation,</v>

478
00:27:56.040 --> 00:28:01.040
<v Speaker 3>but if you go in there with no power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well you're gonna lose obviously.</v>

479
00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:05.700
<v Speaker 3>So the first thing that you need to know</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to negotiate is that you</v>

480
00:28:05.701 --> 00:28:10.701
<v Speaker 3>have to be able to say no and what no </v>
<v Speaker 3>means is that you're not going to do it.</v>

481
00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:15.770
<v Speaker 3>And when I made the videos about bill </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible],</v>

482
00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:17.063
<v Speaker 3>I thought it through and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no damn way I'm following this </v>

483
00:28:20.881 --> 00:28:21.420
<v Speaker 3>law.</v>

484
00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:24.360
<v Speaker 3>I don't care what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I didn't say that lightly.</v>

485
00:28:24.361 --> 00:28:25.740
<v Speaker 3>I thought it through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>

486
00:28:25.741 --> 00:28:26.574
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well let's assume the worst case </v>

487
00:28:29.041 --> 00:28:29.874
<v Speaker 3>scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the worst case scenario would be </v>

488
00:28:31.171 --> 00:28:34.530
<v Speaker 3>that a student would report me to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Ontario Human Rights Commission and then</v>

489
00:28:34.531 --> 00:28:35.364
<v Speaker 3>they would do an investigation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then they would find me guilty because </v>

490
00:28:37.741 --> 00:28:38.574
<v Speaker 3>the Ontario Human Rights Commission </v>
<v Speaker 3>finds 99 percent of the people brought </v>

491
00:28:42.151 --> 00:28:45.570
<v Speaker 3>to it guilty because that's what </v>
<v Speaker 3>totalitarians do.</v>

492
00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:46.643
<v Speaker 3>And then I would refuse to pay the finer</v>
<v Speaker 3>cooperate with whatever the reeducation </v>

493
00:28:50.161 --> 00:28:53.430
<v Speaker 3>they would put me through would be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then that would move to civil court.</v>

494
00:28:53.431 --> 00:28:55.740
<v Speaker 3>And then I would be fine for contempt </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then it would,</v>

495
00:28:55.890 --> 00:28:56.723
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the whole legal catastrophe would </v>

496
00:28:58.021 --> 00:28:59.670
<v Speaker 3>unfold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I thought,</v>

497
00:28:59.671 --> 00:29:00.504
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could either do that or I could allow </v>

498
00:29:02.431 --> 00:29:04.890
<v Speaker 3>the government to regulate my speech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

499
00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:06.840
<v Speaker 3>nope,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not happening.</v>

500
00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:12.280
<v Speaker 3>So you might think about that as </v>
<v Speaker 3>confrontational and it is confrontation.</v>

501
00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:13.113
<v Speaker 3>Let's like there isn't a goddamn thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that can be done to me to make me allow </v>

502
00:29:18.631 --> 00:29:22.290
<v Speaker 3>the government to compel my speech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not happening.</v>

503
00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:25.800
<v Speaker 3>And the reason for that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe the reason for that is because</v>

504
00:29:25.801 --> 00:29:30.600
<v Speaker 3>I spent decades studying </v>
<v Speaker 3>totalitarianism.</v>

505
00:29:31.170 --> 00:29:32.003
<v Speaker 3>It's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the way that totalitarian states </v>

506
00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:39.360
<v Speaker 3>develop is that people give up their </v>
<v Speaker 3>right to be there,</v>

507
00:29:39.361 --> 00:29:40.060
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

508
00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:43.300
<v Speaker 3>to exist their own thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They lie,</v>

509
00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:46.060
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what happens is that individuals,</v>

510
00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:51.510
<v Speaker 3>the individuals sacrifice their own </v>
<v Speaker 3>souls to the dictates of the state.</v>

511
00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:55.600
<v Speaker 3>And then everything goes badly sideways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>

512
00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:56.201
<v Speaker 3>and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

513
00:29:56.201 --> 00:29:59.740
<v Speaker 3>how much evidence for that do we need,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

514
00:29:59.750 --> 00:30:02.320
<v Speaker 3>you're looking at a quarter of a billion</v>
<v Speaker 3>deaths.</v>

515
00:30:02.670 --> 00:30:03.970
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't that enough?</v>

516
00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:06.153
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people that I read who were </v>

517
00:30:06.881 --> 00:30:07.714
<v Speaker 3>profound,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Victor Frankel's a good example for </v>

518
00:30:09.521 --> 00:30:10.354
<v Speaker 3>beginners,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you want to read about this sort of </v>

519
00:30:11.441 --> 00:30:12.274
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrote a book called man's search for </v>

520
00:30:13.421 --> 00:30:14.254
<v Speaker 3>meaning.</v>

521
00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:15.603
<v Speaker 3>And Frankel and also Solzhenitsyn and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>variety of other commentators as well </v>

522
00:30:19.301 --> 00:30:22.030
<v Speaker 3>who really looked into what happened in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

523
00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:25.810
<v Speaker 3>in both the Nazi Germany and in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the communist states.</v>

524
00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:30.940
<v Speaker 3>Their conclusion was universal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that the lies of the state,</v>

525
00:30:30.941 --> 00:30:35.740
<v Speaker 3>the lies and tyranny of the state are </v>
<v Speaker 3>aided and abetted by the moral sacrifice</v>

526
00:30:35.741 --> 00:30:39.340
<v Speaker 3>of the individual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not talked down.</v>

527
00:30:39.850 --> 00:30:42.710
<v Speaker 3>The Nazis are telling you what to do and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're all innocent.</v>

528
00:30:42.711 --> 00:30:46.180
<v Speaker 3>Tendo Bank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not how it works is you,</v>

529
00:30:46.450 --> 00:30:47.283
<v Speaker 3>you falsify your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your being bit by bit and you end up </v>

530
00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:56.650
<v Speaker 3>where you don't want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's a bad idea.</v>

531
00:30:57.070 --> 00:30:57.903
<v Speaker 3>And if you're interested in that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a great book by called ordinary </v>

532
00:31:00.341 --> 00:31:04.480
<v Speaker 3>men and you read that and you won't be </v>
<v Speaker 3>the same person afterwards.</v>

533
00:31:04.481 --> 00:31:05.314
<v Speaker 3>So I would be aware of reading it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a story about these policemen </v>

534
00:31:08.531 --> 00:31:09.190
<v Speaker 3>in Germany.</v>

535
00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:10.900
<v Speaker 3>So they were middle aged guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

536
00:31:10.901 --> 00:31:11.890
<v Speaker 3>and they'd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd been,</v>

537
00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:16.300
<v Speaker 3>they grew up and were socialized before </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Nazis came to power.</v>

538
00:31:16.301 --> 00:31:18.670
<v Speaker 3>So they are just your typical </v>
<v Speaker 3>middleclass policemen.</v>

539
00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:23.200
<v Speaker 3>And they were brought into Poland after </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Nazis had marched through.</v>

540
00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:27.020
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and charged with keeping order in the,</v>

541
00:31:27.021 --> 00:31:31.120
<v Speaker 3>in the occupied state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they knew their,</v>

542
00:31:31.150 --> 00:31:31.983
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their commander knew that it was going </v>

543
00:31:33.551 --> 00:31:34.384
<v Speaker 3>to be brutal because they were in war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a war time and they regard the Jews for </v>

544
00:31:38.561 --> 00:31:39.610
<v Speaker 3>example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as enemies.</v>

545
00:31:39.611 --> 00:31:43.390
<v Speaker 3>And so there was going to be a fair bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>of rounding up with all of that with all</v>

546
00:31:43.391 --> 00:31:44.224
<v Speaker 3>of what that implied.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The commander told the policeman that </v>

547
00:31:46.451 --> 00:31:47.284
<v Speaker 3>they could go home if they wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they didn't have to participate in </v>

548
00:31:49.781 --> 00:31:50.614
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then what ordinary men does is </v>

549
00:31:52.391 --> 00:31:57.370
<v Speaker 3>document document their transformation </v>
<v Speaker 3>from ordinary policemen,</v>

550
00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:59.050
<v Speaker 3>the sort of people that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

551
00:31:59.410 --> 00:32:00.243
<v Speaker 3>two guys who were taking naked pregnant </v>
<v Speaker 3>women out into the middle of fields and </v>

552
00:32:02.681 --> 00:32:07.450
<v Speaker 3>shooting them in the back of the hat and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the documents one step at a time.</v>

553
00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:11.080
<v Speaker 3>How an ordinary person turns into </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone like that.</v>

554
00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:12.491
<v Speaker 3>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

555
00:32:12.491 --> 00:32:15.040
<v Speaker 3>we don't want that sort of thing to </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen anymore.</v>

556
00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:17.770
<v Speaker 3>Well then you don't want to be that sort</v>
<v Speaker 3>of person.</v>

557
00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:18.993
<v Speaker 3>That's how it's fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you're not going to be that sort </v>

558
00:32:21.131 --> 00:32:21.964
<v Speaker 3>of person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you don't take the first steps </v>

559
00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:25.893
<v Speaker 3>because the first steps lead you down a </v>
<v Speaker 3>pathway that at least in principle you </v>

560
00:32:28.841 --> 00:32:29.674
<v Speaker 3>don't want to go so well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think part of what makes me combative </v>

561
00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:35.290
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>compared to someone like height,</v>

562
00:32:35.291 --> 00:32:40.010
<v Speaker 3>is that I've spent years looking at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>worst things there</v>

563
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:43.460
<v Speaker 4>are to look at and I've learned from </v>
<v Speaker 4>that and I've learned,</v>

564
00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:45.470
<v Speaker 4>certainly learned things that I won't </v>
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>

565
00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:49.490
<v Speaker 4>And one of them is I won't let the </v>
<v Speaker 4>government regulate my speech.</v>

566
00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:50.653
<v Speaker 4>It's a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't care what compassionate </v>

567
00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:56.570
<v Speaker 4>principles hypothetically motivate that </v>
<v Speaker 4>move.</v>

568
00:32:56.810 --> 00:33:01.130
<v Speaker 4>It was unprecedented in English common </v>
<v Speaker 4>law that move.</v>

569
00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:05.600
<v Speaker 4>And it was all buried under this leftist</v>
<v Speaker 4>compassion,</v>

570
00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:10.720
<v Speaker 4>which is mostly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's mostly a lie.</v>

571
00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:12.973
<v Speaker 4>So I have reasons I think other than </v>
<v Speaker 4>those that motivate someone like </v>

572
00:33:16.971 --> 00:33:21.971
<v Speaker 4>Jonathan Height to be particularly </v>
<v Speaker 4>passionate about this issue.</v>

573
00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:24.553
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

574
00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:29.080
<v Speaker 1>on the subject of totalitarianism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

575
00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:33.500
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to do something very quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

576
00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:37.013
<v Speaker 1>I'm guessing that even though most </v>
<v Speaker 1>people in the room have negative views </v>

577
00:33:39.631 --> 00:33:42.660
<v Speaker 1>of both men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a more intensely negative view</v>

578
00:33:42.661 --> 00:33:47.661
<v Speaker 1>of Hitler then of Stalin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm guessing almost everyone in the room</v>

579
00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:50.823
<v Speaker 1>has a far more negative visceral </v>
<v Speaker 1>reaction to the swastika than to the </v>

580
00:33:54.581 --> 00:33:55.414
<v Speaker 1>hammer and sickle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of the protesters at your event at </v>

581
00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:03.980
<v Speaker 1>mcmaster university stood behind a </v>
<v Speaker 1>banner with a hammer and sickle.</v>

582
00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:07.580
<v Speaker 1>You've said that a hammer and sickle is </v>
<v Speaker 1>no funnier than a swastika.</v>

583
00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:09.590
<v Speaker 1>That quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reprehensive,</v>

584
00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:10.533
<v Speaker 1>the reprehensible ideologies that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>based in fundamental Marxism killed at </v>

585
00:34:13.521 --> 00:34:15.500
<v Speaker 1>least 100 million people in the 20th </v>
<v Speaker 1>century,</v>

586
00:34:15.501 --> 00:34:16.334
<v Speaker 1>unquote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've discussed this proposition with </v>

587
00:34:18.711 --> 00:34:22.640
<v Speaker 1>numerous people in recent months and </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost no one seems to buy it.</v>

588
00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:27.350
<v Speaker 1>No one disputes the body count under </v>
<v Speaker 1>socialist regimes.</v>

589
00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:28.573
<v Speaker 1>Few dispute that Stalin was a vicious </v>
<v Speaker 1>murderer roughly on par with Hitler in </v>

590
00:34:33.801 --> 00:34:34.634
<v Speaker 1>moral terms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most think that communism should not be </v>

591
00:34:37.881 --> 00:34:39.890
<v Speaker 1>tried again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

592
00:34:39.891 --> 00:34:40.724
<v Speaker 1>they share your critique of the argument</v>
<v Speaker 1>that previous communist experiments did </v>

593
00:34:44.391 --> 00:34:49.220
<v Speaker 1>not represent proper communism and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>proper communism should be tried.</v>

594
00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:51.433
<v Speaker 1>Nevertheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they still disagree with you that we </v>

595
00:34:54.411 --> 00:34:59.330
<v Speaker 1>should react as negatively to the hammer</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sickle as we do to the swastika.</v>

596
00:34:59.690 --> 00:35:00.523
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they say the two ideologies are </v>

597
00:35:03.741 --> 00:35:08.630
<v Speaker 1>not morally comparable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>National Socialism is much worse morally</v>

598
00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:11.330
<v Speaker 1>than Marxism or Marxism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leninism.</v>

599
00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:13.070
<v Speaker 1>So what do you say to this?</v>

600
00:35:16.590 --> 00:35:18.480
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say the first thing is that it's</v>

601
00:35:18.481 --> 00:35:21.150
<v Speaker 4>highly probable that you were talking to</v>
<v Speaker 4>intellectuals.</v>

602
00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:29.990
<v Speaker 1>Students</v>
<v Speaker 1>will call them buddy intellectual.</v>

603
00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:39.420
<v Speaker 3>It is a mystery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

604
00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:40.290
<v Speaker 3>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

605
00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:41.123
<v Speaker 3>it is a mystery because it is the case </v>
<v Speaker 3>that there is something about the Nazi </v>

606
00:35:46.141 --> 00:35:50.060
<v Speaker 3>doctor and that seems to have a visceral</v>
<v Speaker 3>impact that,</v>

607
00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:53.880
<v Speaker 3>that the Communists doc,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dr doesn't have.</v>

608
00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:59.400
<v Speaker 3>And I said when I opened my remarks </v>
<v Speaker 3>tonight that it might be</v>

609
00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:01.063
<v Speaker 2>the</v>

610
00:36:01.770 --> 00:36:04.110
<v Speaker 3>issue of racial superiority.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

611
00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:04.560
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

612
00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:06.990
<v Speaker 3>it's something single that you can put </v>
<v Speaker 3>your finger on.</v>

613
00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:11.340
<v Speaker 3>Whereas what's happening on the left </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's horrifying is murky.</v>

614
00:36:11.610 --> 00:36:12.443
<v Speaker 3>It might even be multidimensional,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like maybe there isn't a single radical </v>

615
00:36:15.091 --> 00:36:18.810
<v Speaker 3>leftist idea that's murderous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the racial superiority doctrine.</v>

616
00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:19.823
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's a combination of three or </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's some set of four out of 10 </v>

617
00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:24.720
<v Speaker 3>who knows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

618
00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:27.540
<v Speaker 3>and because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't seem as repugnant.</v>

619
00:36:27.541 --> 00:36:28.374
<v Speaker 3>And there was also a universalizing </v>
<v Speaker 3>tendency among the communists that </v>

620
00:36:31.951 --> 00:36:36.951
<v Speaker 3>seemed to be less morally reprehensible </v>
<v Speaker 3>than the ethno nationalism of the Nazis.</v>

621
00:36:37.321 --> 00:36:40.560
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think if you go back to 1914,</v>

622
00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:43.590
<v Speaker 3>it's complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you go back to say 19,</v>

623
00:36:43.591 --> 00:36:46.200
<v Speaker 3>18 at the time of the Russian </v>
<v Speaker 3>revolution,</v>

624
00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:47.573
<v Speaker 3>it's not like the communists knew that </v>
<v Speaker 3>their attempts to bring about the </v>

625
00:36:51.391 --> 00:36:55.290
<v Speaker 3>socialist utopia would be due to </v>
<v Speaker 3>absolute murderous catastrophe,</v>

626
00:36:55.291 --> 00:36:56.010
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were.</v>

627
00:36:56.010 --> 00:37:01.010
<v Speaker 3>They were working in ignorance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it's not that simple because by that</v>

628
00:37:01.051 --> 00:37:01.884
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dostoevsky had already written the </v>

629
00:37:03.061 --> 00:37:04.260
<v Speaker 3>devils,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the possessed,</v>

630
00:37:04.261 --> 00:37:05.094
<v Speaker 3>and he outlined very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very clearly what he thought would </v>

631
00:37:07.771 --> 00:37:08.604
<v Speaker 3>happen if people like that got the reins</v>
<v Speaker 3>of power and Nisha had done the same </v>

632
00:37:12.151 --> 00:37:12.984
<v Speaker 3>thing in his writing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So people knew that there was something </v>

633
00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:16.260
<v Speaker 3>toxic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

634
00:37:16.261 --> 00:37:17.094
<v Speaker 3>and deadly about the doctrine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it hadn't been played out on the </v>

635
00:37:20.371 --> 00:37:23.430
<v Speaker 3>world stage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But now it's like,</v>

636
00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:25.463
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is why I said what I said at the </v>

637
00:37:26.281 --> 00:37:28.320
<v Speaker 3>beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fine,</v>

638
00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:30.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

639
00:37:30.930 --> 00:37:31.763
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

640
00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:35.020
<v Speaker 3>I don't know exactly how to make the </v>
<v Speaker 3>moral distinction,</v>

641
00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:39.390
<v Speaker 3>but it's a distinction that has to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>made.</v>

642
00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:43.140
<v Speaker 3>I think that people who apologize,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who say something like,</v>

643
00:37:43.141 --> 00:37:44.420
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that,</v>

644
00:37:47.010 --> 00:37:51.810
<v Speaker 3>that it's virtually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's as reprehensible to</v>

645
00:37:51.811 --> 00:37:52.644
<v Speaker 3>say that a given ethnic group should be </v>
<v Speaker 3>consigned to the fire and to say that </v>

646
00:37:57.001 --> 00:38:00.480
<v Speaker 3>wasn't real communism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're damn close.</v>

647
00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:04.710
<v Speaker 3>And when I hear someone say that wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>real communism,</v>

648
00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:09.830
<v Speaker 3>I know what they mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What they mean was if I was the dictator</v>

649
00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:11.463
<v Speaker 3>installing shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I personally would have brought in the </v>

650
00:38:14.311 --> 00:38:16.920
<v Speaker 3>utopia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what that statement means.</v>

651
00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:18.840
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or it means,</v>

652
00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:19.703
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

653
00:38:19.770 --> 00:38:24.570
<v Speaker 3>an ignorance of history that's so </v>
<v Speaker 3>utterly appalling that,</v>

654
00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:26.633
<v Speaker 2>huh?</v>

655
00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:28.433
<v Speaker 3>That any political statement made on </v>
<v Speaker 3>behalf of that person whatsoever should </v>

656
00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:36.580
<v Speaker 3>immediately be followed by a system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Extreme embarrassment.</v>

657
00:38:38.190 --> 00:38:39.800
<v Speaker 3>I say one just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

658
00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:40.933
<v Speaker 3>I just want to be clear that these </v>
<v Speaker 3>students were conceding that they don't </v>

659
00:38:45.701 --> 00:38:48.980
<v Speaker 3>agree that they share your critique of </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

660
00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:50.770
<v Speaker 3>They don't share it enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

661
00:38:50.771 --> 00:38:52.180
<v Speaker 3>Fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just wanted to make that clear.</v>

662
00:38:52.450 --> 00:38:53.283
<v Speaker 3>But so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they would more or less agree with </v>

663
00:38:54.401 --> 00:38:55.930
<v Speaker 3>what you just said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think about,</v>

664
00:38:56.310 --> 00:38:57.143
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not okay to say those regimes </v>

665
00:38:59.381 --> 00:39:02.020
<v Speaker 3>weren't proper communism and the proper </v>
<v Speaker 3>communism should be tried.</v>

666
00:39:02.021 --> 00:39:06.280
<v Speaker 3>They still dispute though that socialism</v>
<v Speaker 3>as an ideology is on par with Nazi-ism.</v>

667
00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:08.980
<v Speaker 3>So I just wanted to make that we can say</v>
<v Speaker 3>communism.</v>

668
00:39:09.070 --> 00:39:12.550
<v Speaker 3>Let's say we could say radical leftist </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideology,</v>

669
00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:13.593
<v Speaker 3>as I said already.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are reasons for the left and the </v>

670
00:39:15.461 --> 00:39:16.540
<v Speaker 3>right wing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

671
00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:20.170
<v Speaker 3>The right wing stands for hierarchy and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the left wing stands for the,</v>

672
00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:23.110
<v Speaker 3>for those who are displaced by </v>
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy,</v>

673
00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:23.590
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

674
00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:24.423
<v Speaker 3>An endless problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't mean that still leaves </v>

675
00:39:28.571 --> 00:39:29.404
<v Speaker 3>it in the camp of the people speaking on</v>
<v Speaker 3>behalf of egalitarianism to figure out </v>

676
00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:37.600
<v Speaker 3>just what the hell went wrong and to </v>
<v Speaker 3>take some responsibility for it.</v>

677
00:39:38.650 --> 00:39:39.483
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's no joke and we see these things </v>

678
00:39:41.261 --> 00:39:42.094
<v Speaker 3>play out continually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Still look at what happened to </v>

679
00:39:43.511 --> 00:39:45.700
<v Speaker 3>Venezuela.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's a fun story.</v>

680
00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:47.133
<v Speaker 3>Do you know that it is now illegal for </v>
<v Speaker 3>physicians to list list starvation as </v>

681
00:39:52.031 --> 00:39:55.060
<v Speaker 3>the cause of death for a Venezuelan </v>
<v Speaker 3>child in a hospital?</v>

682
00:39:55.540 --> 00:40:00.540
<v Speaker 3>That's how they're dealing with the fact</v>
<v Speaker 3>of starvation right here.</v>

683
00:40:00.671 --> 00:40:04.180
<v Speaker 3>Just make an illegal to have that </v>
<v Speaker 3>diagnosed as your cause of death.</v>

684
00:40:04.330 --> 00:40:06.750
<v Speaker 3>That'll solve the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>

685
00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:08.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have a group of,</v>

686
00:40:08.650 --> 00:40:09.483
<v Speaker 3>of well meaning socialists in Canada who</v>
<v Speaker 3>just produced something called the leap </v>

687
00:40:13.721 --> 00:40:16.720
<v Speaker 3>manifesto a couple of years ago and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>a pretty radical,</v>

688
00:40:17.050 --> 00:40:19.360
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a pretty radical document.</v>

689
00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:21.190
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to move our socialist </v>
<v Speaker 3>party,</v>

690
00:40:21.191 --> 00:40:26.191
<v Speaker 3>the NDP New Democratic Party towards the</v>
<v Speaker 3>acceptance of this leap manifesto,</v>

691
00:40:26.261 --> 00:40:27.940
<v Speaker 3>which doesn't look like it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen,</v>

692
00:40:28.210 --> 00:40:29.043
<v Speaker 3>but they were all radical promoters of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the Venezuelan government before </v>

693
00:40:32.291 --> 00:40:36.220
<v Speaker 3>everything went like badly sideways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

694
00:40:36.221 --> 00:40:39.490
<v Speaker 3>I think the average Venezuelan now has </v>
<v Speaker 3>lost 17 pounds.</v>

695
00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:40.433
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not because they were put on a </v>

696
00:40:41.290 --> 00:40:43.810
<v Speaker 3>voluntary dieting program.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

697
00:40:43.811 --> 00:40:44.644
<v Speaker 3>It's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so if you're tilting towards the </v>

698
00:40:48.011 --> 00:40:50.500
<v Speaker 3>left and you're temperamentally inclined</v>
<v Speaker 3>that way,</v>

699
00:40:50.501 --> 00:40:51.334
<v Speaker 3>and half the population is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you have an ethical problem on </v>

700
00:40:54.101 --> 00:40:55.750
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on your hands,</v>

701
00:40:55.930 --> 00:40:56.763
<v Speaker 3>which is how do you segregate yourself </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the radical policies that produced </v>

702
00:41:00.161 --> 00:41:03.340
<v Speaker 3>the catastrophes of the 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you can't just say,</v>

703
00:41:03.341 --> 00:41:04.660
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not my problem.</v>

704
00:41:04.661 --> 00:41:05.411
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

705
00:41:05.411 --> 00:41:08.680
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's not your problem now,</v>

706
00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:11.350
<v Speaker 3>it certainly might become your problem </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the future.</v>

707
00:41:12.130 --> 00:41:12.963
<v Speaker 3>So when I would say it's actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody's problem in the aftermath of </v>

708
00:41:15.461 --> 00:41:16.360
<v Speaker 3>the 20th century.</v>

709
00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:19.120
<v Speaker 3>It's everybody's problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

710
00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:21.520
<v Speaker 3>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

711
00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:24.190
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's complicated.</v>

712
00:41:24.191 --> 00:41:25.024
<v Speaker 3>Like there is a genuine desire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I worked for a Socialist Party for </v>

713
00:41:29.261 --> 00:41:31.270
<v Speaker 3>quite a while when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

714
00:41:31.330 --> 00:41:34.310
<v Speaker 3>and I saw both sides of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw some very,</v>

715
00:41:34.311 --> 00:41:35.144
<v Speaker 3>very admirable people I was privy for </v>
<v Speaker 3>for a variety of chance reasons to the </v>

716
00:41:41.361 --> 00:41:42.194
<v Speaker 3>leadership of the Socialist Party in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Canada at the provincial and the </v>

717
00:41:44.691 --> 00:41:47.390
<v Speaker 3>national level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I met the people who ran the provinces,</v>

718
00:41:47.391 --> 00:41:48.224
<v Speaker 3>some of the provinces and who ran the </v>
<v Speaker 3>party and a lot of them were really </v>

719
00:41:50.541 --> 00:41:52.790
<v Speaker 3>admirable people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they'd spent their whole life,</v>

720
00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:55.490
<v Speaker 3>I would say working on behalf of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>working class,</v>

721
00:41:55.491 --> 00:41:58.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they were genuine labor leaders and,</v>

722
00:41:58.500 --> 00:41:59.333
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

723
00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:00.283
<v Speaker 3>and there was also a lot done in Canada </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the left that looks like it was </v>

724
00:42:03.111 --> 00:42:06.130
<v Speaker 3>actually pretty good standard workweek.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Info,</v>

725
00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:07.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the establishment of,</v>

726
00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:08.653
<v Speaker 3>of pensions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the introduction of our healthcare </v>

727
00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:14.990
<v Speaker 3>system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I would say probably overall works</v>

728
00:42:14.991 --> 00:42:17.840
<v Speaker 3>better than the American system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although not at the upper end,</v>

729
00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:19.023
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they were working hard on behalf of </v>

730
00:42:21.741 --> 00:42:24.350
<v Speaker 3>people who had working class lives.</v>

731
00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:25.393
<v Speaker 3>But then I also encountered the sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>low level activist types and I didn't </v>

732
00:42:30.081 --> 00:42:30.914
<v Speaker 3>have any respect for them at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just thought they were peevish and </v>

733
00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:33.673
<v Speaker 3>resentful and irritable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And those two things exist in a very </v>

734
00:42:36.591 --> 00:42:40.790
<v Speaker 3>uneasy coalition on the west.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's care for the poor and hatred for</v>

735
00:42:40.791 --> 00:42:41.624
<v Speaker 3>the successful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And those two things aren't the same at </v>

736
00:42:43.461 --> 00:42:44.294
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it looks to me like one of the </v>

737
00:42:45.501 --> 00:42:46.334
<v Speaker 3>things that really happened when the </v>
<v Speaker 3>communist doctrines were brought into </v>

738
00:42:49.041 --> 00:42:49.874
<v Speaker 3>play.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also by the way we did the </v>

739
00:42:51.471 --> 00:42:53.180
<v Speaker 3>multinational experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

740
00:42:53.181 --> 00:42:55.520
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter where you put these </v>
<v Speaker 3>policies into play,</v>

741
00:42:55.521 --> 00:42:56.354
<v Speaker 3>the same bloody outcome occurred.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't matter whether it was Russia or </v>

742
00:42:58.971 --> 00:42:59.804
<v Speaker 3>China or Cambodia or Vietnam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or to pick a random African country or </v>

743
00:43:03.891 --> 00:43:08.660
<v Speaker 3>Cuba or Venezuela for that matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was an unmitigated catastrophe.</v>

744
00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:11.990
<v Speaker 3>And so to me that's experiment plus </v>
<v Speaker 3>replication.</v>

745
00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:15.350
<v Speaker 3>Not Enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

746
00:43:15.890 --> 00:43:17.950
<v Speaker 3>that has to be dealt with and it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the law,</v>

747
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:22.190
<v Speaker 3>the intellectual left in the West has </v>
<v Speaker 3>been absolutely appalling in their PSA.</v>

748
00:43:22.310 --> 00:43:26.120
<v Speaker 3>Silence on the communist catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like for my students,</v>

749
00:43:26.121 --> 00:43:26.954
<v Speaker 3>a lot of my students really haven't </v>
<v Speaker 3>heard about anything that happened in </v>

750
00:43:29.001 --> 00:43:29.834
<v Speaker 3>the Soviet Union in any detail until </v>
<v Speaker 3>they take my personality class in the </v>

751
00:43:33.351 --> 00:43:34.760
<v Speaker 3>second year of university.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

752
00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:35.750
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the hell?</v>

753
00:43:36.110 --> 00:43:36.943
<v Speaker 3>Why are they learning about that in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>personality class in the second year of </v>

754
00:43:39.951 --> 00:43:41.270
<v Speaker 3>university?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not.</v>

755
00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:45.140
<v Speaker 3>That should be first and foremost in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in their,</v>

756
00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:48.200
<v Speaker 3>in their historical knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happened in the 20th century.</v>

757
00:43:48.201 --> 00:43:50.660
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was almost fatal what </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened?</v>

758
00:43:50.661 --> 00:43:53.000
<v Speaker 3>And we still haven't completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>recovered from it,</v>

759
00:43:53.001 --> 00:43:53.930
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

760
00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:54.853
<v Speaker 3>isn't your President Donald trump going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to talk to like insane totalitarian </v>

761
00:43:59.361 --> 00:44:01.790
<v Speaker 3>number one sometime here in the near </v>
<v Speaker 3>future,</v>

762
00:44:01.791 --> 00:44:04.370
<v Speaker 3>but that's still a Soviet era state.</v>

763
00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:07.370
<v Speaker 3>Those people are armed to the teeth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

764
00:44:07.371 --> 00:44:11.150
<v Speaker 3>they have the weapon that they have </v>
<v Speaker 3>weaponry that could easily take you out.</v>

765
00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:13.790
<v Speaker 3>And so we're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you know,</v>

766
00:44:13.791 --> 00:44:14.624
<v Speaker 3>do you know what happens if you blast a </v>
<v Speaker 3>single hydrogen bomb a hundred miles </v>

767
00:44:17.451 --> 00:44:19.460
<v Speaker 3>above the United States?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just one.</v>

768
00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:23.300
<v Speaker 3>You lose all your electronics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

769
00:44:23.330 --> 00:44:25.850
<v Speaker 3>They're all done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tractors,</v>

770
00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:27.800
<v Speaker 3>cars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trains,</v>

771
00:44:27.830 --> 00:44:29.600
<v Speaker 3>subways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>computers,</v>

772
00:44:29.690 --> 00:44:33.750
<v Speaker 3>phones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all them burn out and that's it.</v>

773
00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:37.420
<v Speaker 3>So we're not done with this yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

774
00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:38.263
<v Speaker 3>and the Korean state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>North Korea as an emblematic </v>

775
00:44:40.711 --> 00:44:44.270
<v Speaker 3>representative of the communist </v>
<v Speaker 3>catastrophe and everyone there is,</v>

776
00:44:44.271 --> 00:44:48.630
<v Speaker 3>starves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's millions of people died 20 years</v>

777
00:44:48.631 --> 00:44:50.730
<v Speaker 3>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not got any better.</v>

778
00:44:51.090 --> 00:44:51.923
<v Speaker 3>So it's not like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like we solve this problem and </v>

779
00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:55.793
<v Speaker 3>there's a deafening silence on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>intellectual side of the spectrum with </v>

780
00:44:59.101 --> 00:45:02.730
<v Speaker 3>regards to what happened on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>egalitarian left.</v>

781
00:45:02.910 --> 00:45:05.550
<v Speaker 3>And there's no excuse for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

782
00:45:10.290 --> 00:45:11.123
<v Speaker 1>so somewhat relatedly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's fair to say that even </v>

783
00:45:13.261 --> 00:45:14.094
<v Speaker 1>though you have criticized segments of </v>
<v Speaker 1>both the left social justice warriors </v>

784
00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:20.040
<v Speaker 1>and the right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the alt right,</v>

785
00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:21.473
<v Speaker 1>your critical commentary over the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>year and a half has focused </v>

786
00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:26.850
<v Speaker 1>significantly more on the left than on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the right.</v>

787
00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:28.553
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people I've talked to here at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lafayette at Lafayette take issue with </v>

788
00:45:31.621 --> 00:45:32.454
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say that we're so far from a </v>

789
00:45:34.531 --> 00:45:35.364
<v Speaker 1>Marxist takeover of our culture and </v>
<v Speaker 1>political institutions that to suggest </v>

790
00:45:39.571 --> 00:45:40.404
<v Speaker 1>otherwise is to engage in a classic kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of right wing exaggeration and hysteria </v>

791
00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:45.713
<v Speaker 1>that we've seen before in western </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries in the early to mid 20th </v>

792
00:45:48.001 --> 00:45:50.070
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They also say,</v>

793
00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:54.210
<v Speaker 1>and this is important to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the nationalist authoritarian right</v>

794
00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:58.980
<v Speaker 1>poses more of a threat to freedom of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual than the left does today,</v>

795
00:45:59.250 --> 00:46:02.220
<v Speaker 1>as it has in the West since the early </v>
<v Speaker 1>20th century.</v>

796
00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:06.630
<v Speaker 1>They argued that the left may have sway </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the academy and large segments of the</v>

797
00:46:06.631 --> 00:46:09.300
<v Speaker 1>media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That nationalist right parties,</v>

798
00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:13.470
<v Speaker 1>figures and movements with authoritarian</v>
<v Speaker 1>tendencies have risen,</v>

799
00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:14.453
<v Speaker 1>become potent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and often been victorious in recent </v>

800
00:46:17.130 --> 00:46:19.590
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they point to trump brexit,</v>

801
00:46:19.830 --> 00:46:21.750
<v Speaker 1>the national front pointing to trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump</v>

802
00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:24.390
<v Speaker 3>is rather pointless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

803
00:46:24.391 --> 00:46:25.224
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what trump is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to think of him as a figure of the </v>

804
00:46:27.151 --> 00:46:29.520
<v Speaker 3>radical right is a little on the absurd </v>
<v Speaker 3>side.</v>

805
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:35.000
<v Speaker 3>So I mean we are polarizing and so who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God only knows where the ultimate danger</v>

806
00:46:37.141 --> 00:46:37.974
<v Speaker 3>will come from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it's the ethno nationalists on the </v>

807
00:46:40.021 --> 00:46:42.690
<v Speaker 3>right or if it's the radical leftist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so on the left,</v>

808
00:46:42.691 --> 00:46:43.590
<v Speaker 3>who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

809
00:46:43.591 --> 00:46:46.260
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I suspect to some degree that's a matter</v>

810
00:46:46.261 --> 00:46:47.094
<v Speaker 3>of happenstance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's what you'd expect if you </v>

811
00:46:49.021 --> 00:46:54.021
<v Speaker 3>looked at 20th century history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I emerged out of the academy and the</v>

812
00:46:54.541 --> 00:46:55.374
<v Speaker 3>academy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there are right wing people in the </v>

813
00:46:57.241 --> 00:46:59.880
<v Speaker 3>academy not to speak of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's completely,</v>

814
00:46:59.910 --> 00:47:04.910
<v Speaker 3>that's thoroughly documented and </v>
<v Speaker 3>certainly not the case in a country like</v>

815
00:47:04.951 --> 00:47:05.784
<v Speaker 3>Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no threat whatsoever in Canada </v>

816
00:47:07.951 --> 00:47:09.480
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the radical.</v>

817
00:47:09.481 --> 00:47:10.500
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

818
00:47:10.530 --> 00:47:13.950
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you rounded up everybody</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was on the radical right in Canada,</v>

819
00:47:13.951 --> 00:47:14.784
<v Speaker 3>you might be able to scrape up like what</v>
<v Speaker 3>three or 4,000 people if you really </v>

820
00:47:18.690 --> 00:47:20.370
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you really worked at it,</v>

821
00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:23.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I just don't see that.</v>

822
00:47:23.281 --> 00:47:26.010
<v Speaker 3>At least in my own country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just a non issue.</v>

823
00:47:26.180 --> 00:47:30.010
<v Speaker 3>It's a nonstarter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the last time there was any</v>

824
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:34.360
<v Speaker 4>kind of radical right wingers in Canada </v>
<v Speaker 4>was probably in Quebec in the 19 fifties</v>

825
00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:37.270
<v Speaker 4>and maybe from the 19 thirties to the 19</v>
<v Speaker 4>fifties,</v>

826
00:47:37.271 --> 00:47:41.710
<v Speaker 4>but it's never been a political issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What about the ASD or the Italian?</v>

827
00:47:41.770 --> 00:47:43.660
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember the name of the Italian</v>
<v Speaker 4>party.</v>

828
00:47:44.590 --> 00:47:47.320
<v Speaker 4>The National Front in France.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where would you put would you.</v>

829
00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:47.981
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

830
00:47:47.981 --> 00:47:49.690
<v Speaker 4>I mean you're in Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's more,</v>

831
00:47:50.290 --> 00:47:51.123
<v Speaker 4>there's more polarization I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the Europeans also have problems </v>

832
00:47:54.051 --> 00:47:55.720
<v Speaker 4>that we don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

833
00:47:55.721 --> 00:47:56.554
<v Speaker 4>they've been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've been struggling with the </v>

834
00:47:58.421 --> 00:48:03.421
<v Speaker 4>consequences of non ending violence in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the Middle East and the wave of refugees</v>

835
00:48:03.581 --> 00:48:05.380
<v Speaker 4>that has emerged as a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

836
00:48:05.381 --> 00:48:09.640
<v Speaker 4>And so the situation in Europe is </v>
<v Speaker 4>different than I would say there is more</v>

837
00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:12.940
<v Speaker 4>movement and activity on the right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

838
00:48:13.150 --> 00:48:16.190
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

839
00:48:16.370 --> 00:48:20.870
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a admirer of identity politics </v>
<v Speaker 4>while,</v>

840
00:48:20.871 --> 00:48:21.704
<v Speaker 4>and that's for the reasons I brought up </v>
<v Speaker 4>to begin with think that you have to </v>

841
00:48:25.490 --> 00:48:26.323
<v Speaker 4>decide</v>

842
00:48:27.470 --> 00:48:29.750
<v Speaker 4>conceptually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>psychologically,</v>

843
00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:34.990
<v Speaker 4>familiarly and socially what your vision</v>
<v Speaker 4>of a human being is.</v>

844
00:48:35.631 --> 00:48:36.464
<v Speaker 4>And if your vision of a human being is </v>
<v Speaker 4>essentially tribal so that you're </v>

845
00:48:39.261 --> 00:48:41.900
<v Speaker 4>defined by your collective identity in </v>
<v Speaker 4>some manner,</v>

846
00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:45.110
<v Speaker 4>then you're going to play identity </v>
<v Speaker 4>politics on the left.</v>

847
00:48:45.111 --> 00:48:47.180
<v Speaker 4>You're going to play identity politics </v>
<v Speaker 4>on the right.</v>

848
00:48:47.540 --> 00:48:48.021
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

849
00:48:48.021 --> 00:48:48.854
<v Speaker 4>I think the identity politics types on </v>
<v Speaker 4>the left pose a bigger threat in my </v>

850
00:48:51.831 --> 00:48:52.664
<v Speaker 4>country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not so obvious in your country </v>

851
00:48:54.351 --> 00:48:55.184
<v Speaker 4>because you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your political landscape is more </v>

852
00:48:57.771 --> 00:48:58.730
<v Speaker 4>balanced,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say,</v>

853
00:48:58.731 --> 00:48:59.564
<v Speaker 4>than ours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If the radical right posed a threat to </v>

854
00:49:01.971 --> 00:49:05.240
<v Speaker 4>the academy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which they most decidedly do not,</v>

855
00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:07.550
<v Speaker 4>then I would be just as upset about </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

856
00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.550
<v Speaker 4>And so I think again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

857
00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:15.110
<v Speaker 4>it's part and parcel of the radical left</v>
<v Speaker 4>failure to take or the lefts in general,</v>

858
00:49:15.111 --> 00:49:17.420
<v Speaker 4>failure to take responsibility for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>radicals.</v>

859
00:49:17.421 --> 00:49:17.870
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

860
00:49:17.870 --> 00:49:18.703
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why aren't you criticizing equally on </v>

861
00:49:20.301 --> 00:49:21.680
<v Speaker 4>both sides?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

862
00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:25.850
<v Speaker 4>the threat doesn't exist equally on both</v>
<v Speaker 4>sides,</v>

863
00:49:25.851 --> 00:49:27.980
<v Speaker 4>not in my country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

864
00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.310
<v Speaker 4>I think identity politics is murderous </v>
<v Speaker 4>game,</v>

865
00:49:32.311 --> 00:49:33.720
<v Speaker 4>no matter who plays it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

866
00:49:33.721 --> 00:49:35.730
<v Speaker 4>and on the left it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

867
00:49:35.731 --> 00:49:36.564
<v Speaker 4>we've already talked about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what's wrong on the right while you </v>

868
00:49:39.301 --> 00:49:40.134
<v Speaker 4>stand up and wave your flag and talk </v>
<v Speaker 4>about your ethnic identity or your </v>

869
00:49:42.631 --> 00:49:44.640
<v Speaker 4>racial identity and you take pride in </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

870
00:49:44.641 --> 00:49:45.474
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the hell did that have to do with </v>

871
00:49:46.141 --> 00:49:49.350
<v Speaker 4>you yet had goddamn loser?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

872
00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:50.333
<v Speaker 4>it's like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're one of the great heroes of the </v>

873
00:49:51.571 --> 00:49:52.261
<v Speaker 4>past,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are you.</v>

874
00:49:52.261 --> 00:49:54.300
<v Speaker 4>That's why you're standing up and waving</v>
<v Speaker 4>your flag.</v>

875
00:49:54.301 --> 00:49:54.991
<v Speaker 4>It's no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not.</v>

876
00:49:54.991 --> 00:49:55.824
<v Speaker 4>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're identifying with your group </v>

877
00:49:57.061 --> 00:49:59.250
<v Speaker 4>because you don't have anything of your </v>
<v Speaker 4>own to offer.</v>

878
00:49:59.820 --> 00:50:00.653
<v Speaker 4>And so it's pathetic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I've said that many times and in my </v>

879
00:50:03.301 --> 00:50:05.070
<v Speaker 4>lectures to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and people know this,</v>

880
00:50:05.071 --> 00:50:07.800
<v Speaker 4>if they've actually watched my </v>
<v Speaker 4>university lectures,</v>

881
00:50:08.100 --> 00:50:13.100
<v Speaker 4>I spend a tremendous amount of time and </v>
<v Speaker 4>have for 30 years convincing my students</v>

882
00:50:13.741 --> 00:50:14.574
<v Speaker 4>that if they had been in Nazi Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a very high probability that </v>

883
00:50:17.701 --> 00:50:21.030
<v Speaker 4>rather than being Oskar Schindler and </v>
<v Speaker 4>rescuing the Jews,</v>

884
00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:22.073
<v Speaker 4>they would have been a Nazi persecutor </v>
<v Speaker 4>because there's like five Oskar </v>

885
00:50:26.010 --> 00:50:28.640
<v Speaker 4>Schindler's and like many million Nazis.</v>

886
00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:32.360
<v Speaker 3>So you can do the math for yourself and </v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't think that,</v>

887
00:50:32.450 --> 00:50:34.940
<v Speaker 3>if you think that you would have been </v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the few heroes,</v>

888
00:50:34.941 --> 00:50:35.774
<v Speaker 3>then you're either someone truly </v>
<v Speaker 3>remarkable or you're unbelievably </v>

889
00:50:41.391 --> 00:50:42.224
<v Speaker 3>diluted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I would suspect that you're in </v>

890
00:50:44.841 --> 00:50:48.800
<v Speaker 3>the unbelievably diluted camp because </v>
<v Speaker 3>truly remarkable people are rare.</v>

891
00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:49.783
<v Speaker 3>And I've really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've really seen this in the last year </v>

892
00:50:51.591 --> 00:50:53.600
<v Speaker 3>or two because one of the things I have </v>
<v Speaker 3>noted,</v>

893
00:50:53.601 --> 00:50:56.230
<v Speaker 3>like I knew that people were timid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

894
00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:59.570
<v Speaker 3>and I knew why it's dangerous to stick </v>
<v Speaker 3>your head up above the rest.</v>

895
00:50:59.571 --> 00:51:00.404
<v Speaker 3>I mean its Predator avoidance strategy </v>
<v Speaker 3>to keep your head down and I mean that </v>

896
00:51:04.401 --> 00:51:05.234
<v Speaker 3>technically it truly is to blend in with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the crowd is a predatory avoidance </v>

897
00:51:08.751 --> 00:51:11.780
<v Speaker 3>strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what fish do in schools of fish.</v>

898
00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:15.740
<v Speaker 3>Like it's very low level behavior and if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you stick your head up there's some real</v>

899
00:51:15.741 --> 00:51:16.574
<v Speaker 3>danger and the advantage to that is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are pretty civilized and they go </v>

900
00:51:19.941 --> 00:51:22.670
<v Speaker 3>along with the group and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a good thing because you know,</v>

901
00:51:22.671 --> 00:51:24.590
<v Speaker 3>we should be civilized and go along with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the group,</v>

902
00:51:24.591 --> 00:51:25.424
<v Speaker 3>but it's a really bad thing when the </v>
<v Speaker 3>group goes sideways and I've had many </v>

903
00:51:29.031 --> 00:51:31.910
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>colleagues but many other people to say,</v>

904
00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:34.460
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we agree with what you're doing,</v>

905
00:51:34.461 --> 00:51:37.430
<v Speaker 3>but we can't really take the risk of </v>
<v Speaker 3>standing up and saying.</v>

906
00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:38.263
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well now and then so most people fall </v>

907
00:51:40.851 --> 00:51:44.060
<v Speaker 3>into that camp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I went to Queens University a month</v>

908
00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:47.240
<v Speaker 3>ago and was subject to that chilling </v>
<v Speaker 3>demonstration,</v>

909
00:51:47.241 --> 00:51:52.241
<v Speaker 3>I would say were the radicals climbed up</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the stain glass window window wells</v>

910
00:51:53.301 --> 00:51:54.510
<v Speaker 3>and pounded,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

911
00:51:54.830 --> 00:51:57.890
<v Speaker 3>unendingly for 90 minutes while we were </v>
<v Speaker 3>all inside.</v>

912
00:51:58.280 --> 00:52:00.470
<v Speaker 3>I had a professor write me the day </v>
<v Speaker 3>before and say,</v>

913
00:52:00.471 --> 00:52:03.020
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my wife and I work at the university,</v>

914
00:52:03.021 --> 00:52:03.854
<v Speaker 3>we really support what you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we can't even risk coming to the </v>

915
00:52:07.041 --> 00:52:10.670
<v Speaker 3>talk because what if the students see </v>
<v Speaker 3>and complaint?</v>

916
00:52:10.940 --> 00:52:11.541
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

917
00:52:11.541 --> 00:52:12.900
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's courage for you,</v>

918
00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:14.190
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's courage for it,</v>

919
00:52:14.650 --> 00:52:15.710
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

920
00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:19.370
<v Speaker 3>but that's par for the course and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's unsurprising to some degree.</v>

921
00:52:20.030 --> 00:52:20.863
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

922
00:52:21.540 --> 00:52:22.470
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but anyways,</v>

923
00:52:22.471 --> 00:52:23.490
<v Speaker 4>on the right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like</v>

924
00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:30.560
<v Speaker 4>it's an excuse by people on the left not</v>
<v Speaker 4>to take the things that I'm saying.</v>

925
00:52:30.871 --> 00:52:32.970
<v Speaker 4>Seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what it is.</v>

926
00:52:33.090 --> 00:52:33.571
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

927
00:52:33.571 --> 00:52:35.280
<v Speaker 4>he's not attacking the right as,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as,</v>

928
00:52:35.370 --> 00:52:36.210
<v Speaker 4>as much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

929
00:52:36.211 --> 00:52:38.010
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not after me.</v>

930
00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:40.800
<v Speaker 4>They're not trying to close down my </v>
<v Speaker 4>speech.</v>

931
00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:42.503
<v Speaker 4>So I took that personally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So had it been right wingers coming </v>

932
00:52:45.661 --> 00:52:47.250
<v Speaker 4>after me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

933
00:52:47.310 --> 00:52:52.140
<v Speaker 4>it would've been the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's a foolish objection,</v>

934
00:52:52.230 --> 00:52:53.063
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

935
00:52:57.590 --> 00:52:58.423
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

936
00:53:00.340 --> 00:53:02.230
<v Speaker 3>For decades,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ethnic groups have,</v>

937
00:53:02.231 --> 00:53:03.064
<v Speaker 3>on average,</v>
<v Speaker 3>scored significantly differently on Iq </v>

938
00:53:05.291 --> 00:53:06.124
<v Speaker 3>tests.</v>
<v Speaker 3>According to psychology professor </v>

939
00:53:08.381 --> 00:53:09.214
<v Speaker 3>Richard Hair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whom you interviewed on your channel </v>

940
00:53:10.990 --> 00:53:13.570
<v Speaker 3>Youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was no scientific consensus on the</v>

941
00:53:13.571 --> 00:53:16.630
<v Speaker 3>causes of these average differences in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Iq test scores.</v>

942
00:53:16.930 --> 00:53:18.250
<v Speaker 3>Yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>according to Haier,</v>

943
00:53:18.490 --> 00:53:19.323
<v Speaker 3>psychologists do generally agree that </v>
<v Speaker 3>general intelligence exists that Iq </v>

944
00:53:23.891 --> 00:53:26.160
<v Speaker 3>measures that well and in a non </v>
<v Speaker 3>culturally</v>

945
00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:26.993
<v Speaker 1>biased way that Iq is highly predictive </v>
<v Speaker 1>of success and educational and </v>

946
00:53:31.381 --> 00:53:35.580
<v Speaker 1>professional terms and that for decades </v>
<v Speaker 1>ethnic groups have on average,</v>

947
00:53:35.581 --> 00:53:39.240
<v Speaker 1>scored significantly differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So assuming this is true,</v>

948
00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:40.133
<v Speaker 1>should we talk about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sam Harris raised this question and a </v>

949
00:53:43.141 --> 00:53:45.300
<v Speaker 1>podcast conversation with Charles </v>
<v Speaker 1>Murray.</v>

950
00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:46.853
<v Speaker 1>Some argue that we should not talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>this as doing so could fuel the racial </v>

951
00:53:51.181 --> 00:53:55.530
<v Speaker 1>supremacist movements that you mentioned</v>
<v Speaker 1>with potentially horrific consequences.</v>

952
00:53:55.980 --> 00:53:56.813
<v Speaker 1>Others mainly on the intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 1>darkweb and to a very limited extent in </v>

953
00:54:00.991 --> 00:54:01.824
<v Speaker 1>academia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think we should talk about this topic </v>

954
00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:07.740
<v Speaker 1>because average differences in Iq scores</v>
<v Speaker 1>have existed for decades.</v>

955
00:54:08.490 --> 00:54:12.360
<v Speaker 1>They may have played a role in </v>
<v Speaker 1>generating the disparate educational and</v>

956
00:54:12.361 --> 00:54:15.540
<v Speaker 1>professional outcomes that we observe </v>
<v Speaker 1>and care about.</v>

957
00:54:16.020 --> 00:54:16.853
<v Speaker 1>And thus we cannot properly analyze </v>
<v Speaker 1>these disparate outcomes unless we do </v>

958
00:54:20.281 --> 00:54:23.760
<v Speaker 1>talk about the subject openly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Geneticists,</v>

959
00:54:23.790 --> 00:54:24.623
<v Speaker 1>David Reich recently argued in the New </v>
<v Speaker 1>York Times that have scientists do not </v>

960
00:54:28.291 --> 00:54:31.230
<v Speaker 1>openly discussed the biological basis of</v>
<v Speaker 1>race.</v>

961
00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:35.700
<v Speaker 1>Pseudo scientists could fill the vacuum </v>
<v Speaker 1>with dangerous consequences.</v>

962
00:54:36.150 --> 00:54:37.350
<v Speaker 1>Furthermore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

963
00:54:37.351 --> 00:54:38.184
<v Speaker 1>Professor Peterson are highly critical </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the oppression narrative that </v>

964
00:54:42.001 --> 00:54:42.834
<v Speaker 1>permeates segments of the academy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>activist left and knowledge about </v>

965
00:54:47.071 --> 00:54:50.610
<v Speaker 1>average differences in Iq scores between</v>
<v Speaker 1>ethnic groups,</v>

966
00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:54.150
<v Speaker 1>while tough to assimilate could puncture</v>
<v Speaker 1>this narrative.</v>

967
00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:57.690
<v Speaker 1>So the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is your view on all that?</v>

968
00:54:57.691 --> 00:55:01.140
<v Speaker 1>I've just said she's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys already didn't take a long time</v>

969
00:55:01.141 --> 00:55:02.790
<v Speaker 1>to prepare these questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't you?</v>

970
00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:07.033
<v Speaker 5>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

971
00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:14.440
<v Speaker 5>when I went to Harvard,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I came from mcgill and I had spent a lot</v>

972
00:55:15.021 --> 00:55:15.854
<v Speaker 5>of time with my advisor there and a </v>
<v Speaker 5>research team that he had trying to </v>

973
00:55:21.291 --> 00:55:25.670
<v Speaker 5>understand the genesis of antisocial </v>
<v Speaker 5>behavior and</v>

974
00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:30.210
<v Speaker 3>among adolescents mostly so well as kids</v>
<v Speaker 3>as well.</v>

975
00:55:30.450 --> 00:55:31.283
<v Speaker 3>Anti social behavior is very persistent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you have a child whose conduct </v>

976
00:55:34.231 --> 00:55:35.064
<v Speaker 3>disordered at the age of four,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the probability that they will be </v>

977
00:55:38.581 --> 00:55:42.180
<v Speaker 3>criminal at the age of 15 or 20 is </v>
<v Speaker 3>extremely high.</v>

978
00:55:42.270 --> 00:55:43.103
<v Speaker 3>It's unbelievably stable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very dismal literature because </v>

979
00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:47.213
<v Speaker 3>you see these early onset aggressive </v>
<v Speaker 3>kids and and it's persistent and then </v>

980
00:55:52.351 --> 00:55:53.184
<v Speaker 3>you look at the intervention literature </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you throw up your hands because no </v>

981
00:55:56.551 --> 00:55:57.384
<v Speaker 3>interventions work and believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychologists have tried everything you </v>

982
00:56:00.061 --> 00:56:00.894
<v Speaker 3>could possibly imagine and a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that you can't in order to </v>

983
00:56:03.811 --> 00:56:04.644
<v Speaker 3>ameliorate that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're really interested in trying to </v>

984
00:56:07.350 --> 00:56:08.520
<v Speaker 3>understand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

985
00:56:09.090 --> 00:56:09.923
<v Speaker 3>if you're antisocial by the age of four,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then there isn't an intervention that </v>

986
00:56:13.501 --> 00:56:15.480
<v Speaker 3>seems to be effective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

987
00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:17.033
<v Speaker 3>and the standard penal logical theory is</v>
<v Speaker 3>really quite horrifying in this regard </v>

988
00:56:20.611 --> 00:56:24.610
<v Speaker 3>because what you see is that male </v>
<v Speaker 3>aggression around the age of 15 and then</v>

989
00:56:24.611 --> 00:56:27.340
<v Speaker 3>it declines fairly precipitously and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

990
00:56:27.550 --> 00:56:30.790
<v Speaker 3>and sort of normalizes again by the age </v>
<v Speaker 3>of 27.</v>

991
00:56:30.790 --> 00:56:34.330
<v Speaker 3>And Standard penal logical theory </v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially is this cold hearted.</v>

992
00:56:34.331 --> 00:56:35.164
<v Speaker 3>It's like if you have a mold,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have someone who's a multiple </v>

993
00:56:37.601 --> 00:56:38.434
<v Speaker 3>offender,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just throw them in prison until </v>

994
00:56:38.981 --> 00:56:43.810
<v Speaker 3>they're 27 and then the age out of it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's all there is to it.</v>

995
00:56:43.930 --> 00:56:45.730
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what we've got.</v>

996
00:56:46.210 --> 00:56:47.043
<v Speaker 3>Now there's some downside to that </v>
<v Speaker 3>because there's a corollary literature </v>

997
00:56:49.151 --> 00:56:49.984
<v Speaker 3>that suggests that the worst thing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can do with antisocial people is to </v>

998
00:56:52.451 --> 00:56:55.270
<v Speaker 3>group them together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what we do in prisons.</v>

999
00:56:55.420 --> 00:56:56.980
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's a whole mess.</v>

1000
00:56:57.160 --> 00:56:57.993
<v Speaker 3>Anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things we were doing was </v>

1001
00:56:59.771 --> 00:57:00.604
<v Speaker 3>trying to see if there might be </v>
<v Speaker 3>cognitive predictors of antisocial </v>

1002
00:57:03.461 --> 00:57:04.294
<v Speaker 3>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we use this battery of </v>

1003
00:57:06.011 --> 00:57:06.844
<v Speaker 3>neuropsychological tests that was put </v>
<v Speaker 3>together at the Montreal Neurological </v>

1004
00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:10.953
<v Speaker 3>Institute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>took about 11 hours to administer and </v>

1005
00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:15.220
<v Speaker 3>hypothetically assessed prefrontal </v>
<v Speaker 3>cortical function.</v>

1006
00:57:16.070 --> 00:57:18.910
<v Speaker 3>We computerize that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reduced it to about 90 minutes.</v>

1007
00:57:18.911 --> 00:57:23.020
<v Speaker 3>And then I'm assessed antisocial </v>
<v Speaker 3>adolescents in,</v>

1008
00:57:23.100 --> 00:57:23.933
<v Speaker 3>in Montreal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and found out that they did show </v>

1009
00:57:25.031 --> 00:57:29.140
<v Speaker 3>deficits in problem solving ability that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were associated with,</v>

1010
00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:31.030
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with prefrontal ability.</v>

1011
00:57:31.650 --> 00:57:34.330
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I got to Harvard,</v>

1012
00:57:34.331 --> 00:57:34.811
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1013
00:57:34.811 --> 00:57:35.644
<v Speaker 3>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We could use the neuro psych battery to </v>

1014
00:57:38.890 --> 00:57:39.723
<v Speaker 3>predict negative behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Perhaps we could use it to predict </v>

1015
00:57:43.271 --> 00:57:44.980
<v Speaker 3>positive behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I thought,</v>

1016
00:57:44.981 --> 00:57:45.814
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what if we turned the neuro psych </v>

1017
00:57:46.691 --> 00:57:49.720
<v Speaker 3>battery and over and thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1018
00:57:49.721 --> 00:57:51.520
<v Speaker 3>can we predict grades,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

1019
00:57:51.521 --> 00:57:53.500
<v Speaker 3>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a decent thing to predict.</v>

1020
00:57:53.501 --> 00:57:54.334
<v Speaker 3>So we ran a study,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we ran a study that looked at Harvard </v>

1021
00:57:57.791 --> 00:57:58.624
<v Speaker 3>kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>University of Toronto kids line workers </v>

1022
00:58:00.911 --> 00:58:05.320
<v Speaker 3>at a Milwaukee factory and managers and </v>
<v Speaker 3>executives at the same factory.</v>

1023
00:58:05.321 --> 00:58:06.154
<v Speaker 3>And what we found was that the average </v>
<v Speaker 3>score across these neuro psychological </v>

1024
00:58:11.021 --> 00:58:12.580
<v Speaker 3>tests,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were kind of like games.</v>

1025
00:58:12.581 --> 00:58:13.840
<v Speaker 3>They were game like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

1026
00:58:13.841 --> 00:58:16.490
<v Speaker 3>So in one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in one test you had,</v>

1027
00:58:16.570 --> 00:58:20.830
<v Speaker 3>there were five lights in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the screen and a box was associated with</v>

1028
00:58:20.890 --> 00:58:23.110
<v Speaker 3>each light and you had to learn by trial</v>
<v Speaker 3>and error,</v>

1029
00:58:23.111 --> 00:58:25.510
<v Speaker 3>which box was associated with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with each light.</v>

1030
00:58:25.510 --> 00:58:27.410
<v Speaker 3>That was one of the tests.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1031
00:58:28.390 --> 00:58:29.223
<v Speaker 3>so we took people's average score across</v>
<v Speaker 3>the tests because they seem to clump </v>

1032
00:58:33.641 --> 00:58:36.970
<v Speaker 3>together into a single structure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can do,</v>

1033
00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.700
<v Speaker 3>you can find that out statistically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you take a bunch of tests,</v>

1034
00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:40.833
<v Speaker 3>you can find out how they clumped </v>
<v Speaker 3>together statistically by looking at </v>

1035
00:58:42.851 --> 00:58:45.700
<v Speaker 3>their patterns of correlations and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>might get multiple clumps,</v>

1036
00:58:45.701 --> 00:58:49.090
<v Speaker 3>which is what happens with personality </v>
<v Speaker 3>research where you get five or you might</v>

1037
00:58:49.091 --> 00:58:49.924
<v Speaker 3>get a singular clump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what happens in cognitive </v>

1038
00:58:52.211 --> 00:58:55.150
<v Speaker 3>research.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we got a single plump essentially.</v>

1039
00:58:55.600 --> 00:58:56.433
<v Speaker 3>And then we were trying to figure out if</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the same time I was reading the </v>

1040
00:58:59.801 --> 00:59:00.634
<v Speaker 3>literature on performance prediction and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's an extensive literature on </v>

1041
00:59:03.731 --> 00:59:04.564
<v Speaker 3>performance prediction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of it generated by the armed </v>

1042
00:59:06.011 --> 00:59:06.970
<v Speaker 3>forces.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>

1043
00:59:07.370 --> 00:59:11.500
<v Speaker 3>I'm indicating that ICU is a very good </v>
<v Speaker 3>predictor of longterm life success.</v>

1044
00:59:11.770 --> 00:59:14.860
<v Speaker 3>And so here's the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the general rule.</v>

1045
00:59:16.030 --> 00:59:16.863
<v Speaker 3>If your job is simple,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which means you do the same thing </v>

1046
00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:21.740
<v Speaker 3>everyday than Iq predicts how fast learn</v>
<v Speaker 3>the job,</v>

1047
00:59:21.741 --> 00:59:25.280
<v Speaker 3>but not how well you you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if your job is complex,</v>

1048
00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:28.370
<v Speaker 3>which means that the demands change on </v>
<v Speaker 3>an ongoing basis,</v>

1049
00:59:28.371 --> 00:59:31.430
<v Speaker 3>then the best predictor of success is </v>
<v Speaker 3>general cognitive ability.</v>

1050
00:59:31.940 --> 00:59:35.210
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I learned that the general cognitive</v>

1051
00:59:35.211 --> 00:59:38.990
<v Speaker 3>ability tests clump together into a </v>
<v Speaker 3>single factor that's fluid intelligence.</v>

1052
00:59:38.991 --> 00:59:39.824
<v Speaker 3>Or or ICU,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then we didn't know if the factor </v>

1053
00:59:41.841 --> 00:59:42.674
<v Speaker 3>that we had found was the same factor as</v>
<v Speaker 3>Iq and it and we still haven't really </v>

1054
00:59:47.031 --> 00:59:47.864
<v Speaker 3>figured out whether or not that was the </v>
<v Speaker 3>case because it kind of depends on how </v>

1055
00:59:49.761 --> 00:59:51.560
<v Speaker 3>you do the analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but anyways,</v>

1056
00:59:51.561 --> 00:59:55.340
<v Speaker 3>I got deeply into the performance </v>
<v Speaker 3>prediction literature and I found out,</v>

1057
00:59:55.370 --> 00:59:56.203
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you want to predict people's </v>

1058
00:59:56.931 --> 00:59:58.100
<v Speaker 3>performance in life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's.</v>

1059
00:59:58.490 --> 00:59:59.900
<v Speaker 3>There's a couple of things you need to </v>
<v Speaker 3>know.</v>

1060
00:59:59.901 --> 01:00:01.760
<v Speaker 3>You need to know their general cognitive</v>
<v Speaker 3>ability.</v>

1061
01:00:01.761 --> 01:00:02.594
<v Speaker 3>If they're going to do a complex job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need to know their trait </v>

1062
01:00:05.301 --> 01:00:06.134
<v Speaker 3>conscientiousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of you might've heard that </v>

1063
01:00:08.271 --> 01:00:11.810
<v Speaker 3>rebranded as grit in a very corrupt act </v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

1064
01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:15.380
<v Speaker 3>because it's a good predictor of </v>
<v Speaker 3>longterm life success.</v>

1065
01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:19.940
<v Speaker 3>Freedom from negative emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Low neuroticism is another predictor,</v>

1066
01:00:19.941 --> 01:00:24.350
<v Speaker 3>but it's sorta third on the hierarchy </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then openness to experience which is</v>

1067
01:00:24.351 --> 01:00:27.770
<v Speaker 3>a personality trait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is associated with expertise in creative</v>

1068
01:00:27.771 --> 01:00:28.604
<v Speaker 3>domains.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The evidence that now I should tell you </v>

1069
01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:35.240
<v Speaker 3>since it's such a complicated question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should tell you how to make an Iq test</v>

1070
01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:38.930
<v Speaker 3>because actually really easy and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>need to know this to actually understand</v>

1071
01:00:38.931 --> 01:00:43.280
<v Speaker 3>what I que it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so imagine that you generated a a set of</v>

1072
01:00:43.281 --> 01:00:45.530
<v Speaker 3>10,000 questions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1073
01:00:45.531 --> 01:00:48.320
<v Speaker 3>About anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could be math problems.</v>

1074
01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:50.510
<v Speaker 3>They could be general knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they could be vocabulary,</v>

1075
01:00:50.511 --> 01:00:51.344
<v Speaker 3>that could be multiple choice and really</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't matter what they're about as </v>

1076
01:00:53.271 --> 01:00:55.520
<v Speaker 3>long as they require abstraction to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Seoul,</v>

1077
01:00:55.610 --> 01:00:59.960
<v Speaker 3>so they'd be formulated linguistically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but mathematically would also apply.</v>

1078
01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:03.080
<v Speaker 3>And then you have those 10,000 </v>
<v Speaker 3>questions.</v>

1079
01:01:03.110 --> 01:01:07.850
<v Speaker 3>Now you take a random set of 100 of </v>
<v Speaker 3>those questions and you've given them to</v>

1080
01:01:07.851 --> 01:01:11.390
<v Speaker 3>a thousand people and all you do is sum </v>
<v Speaker 3>up the answers right from.</v>

1081
01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:12.583
<v Speaker 3>So some people are going to get most of </v>
<v Speaker 3>them right and some of some of them are </v>

1082
01:01:14.361 --> 01:01:15.194
<v Speaker 3>going to get most of them wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just rank order the people in terms </v>

1083
01:01:17.271 --> 01:01:21.140
<v Speaker 3>of their score,</v>
<v Speaker 3>correct that for age and you have Iq.</v>

1084
01:01:21.530 --> 01:01:22.363
<v Speaker 3>That's all there is to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what you'll find is that no matter </v>

1085
01:01:24.861 --> 01:01:27.740
<v Speaker 3>which random set of 100 questions you </v>
<v Speaker 3>take,</v>

1086
01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:32.110
<v Speaker 3>the people at the top of one random set </v>
<v Speaker 3>will be at the top of all the others and</v>

1087
01:01:32.130 --> 01:01:33.800
<v Speaker 3>and with very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

1088
01:01:33.801 --> 01:01:35.150
<v Speaker 3>very high consistency.</v>

1089
01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:40.360
<v Speaker 3>So one thing you need to know is that if</v>
<v Speaker 3>any social science claims whatsoever are</v>

1090
01:01:40.731 --> 01:01:41.564
<v Speaker 3>correct,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the ICU claims are correct because </v>

1091
01:01:46.251 --> 01:01:47.084
<v Speaker 3>the ICU claims are more psychometrically</v>
<v Speaker 3>rigorous than any other phenomena </v>

1092
01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:53.600
<v Speaker 3>phenomenon that's been discovered by </v>
<v Speaker 3>social scientists.</v>

1093
01:01:54.050 --> 01:01:54.883
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ICU literature is a dismal </v>

1094
01:01:55.881 --> 01:01:57.620
<v Speaker 3>literature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one likes it.</v>

1095
01:01:57.770 --> 01:01:59.390
<v Speaker 3>Here's why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's an example.</v>

1096
01:01:59.630 --> 01:02:02.630
<v Speaker 3>So here's a little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's a fun little fact for you,</v>

1097
01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:03.733
<v Speaker 3>for Liberals and conservatives alike,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because conservatives think there's a </v>

1098
01:02:05.811 --> 01:02:06.644
<v Speaker 3>job for everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If people just get off their asses and </v>

1099
01:02:08.181 --> 01:02:10.010
<v Speaker 3>get to work and liberals think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1100
01:02:10.011 --> 01:02:12.020
<v Speaker 3>you can train anyone to do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1101
01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:15.230
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there isn't a job for everyone and no,</v>

1102
01:02:15.290 --> 01:02:18.380
<v Speaker 3>you can't train everyone to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything that's wrong.</v>

1103
01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:20.820
<v Speaker 3>And here's one of the consequences of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1104
01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:22.193
<v Speaker 3>So as I mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Armed Forces has done a lot of work </v>

1105
01:02:24.271 --> 01:02:26.490
<v Speaker 3>on ICU when they started back in 19,</v>
<v Speaker 3>19,</v>

1106
01:02:26.491 --> 01:02:28.680
<v Speaker 3>and the reason they did that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>

1107
01:02:28.950 --> 01:02:33.510
<v Speaker 3>well for obvious reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say let's say there's a war and you want</v>

1108
01:02:33.511 --> 01:02:34.344
<v Speaker 3>to get qualified people into the officer</v>
<v Speaker 3>positions as rapidly as possible or </v>

1109
01:02:37.561 --> 01:02:38.394
<v Speaker 3>you'll lose.</v>

1110
01:02:38.850 --> 01:02:41.010
<v Speaker 3>So that's a reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1111
01:02:41.011 --> 01:02:44.940
<v Speaker 3>the armed forces has experimented with </v>
<v Speaker 3>Iq tests since 19,</v>

1112
01:02:44.941 --> 01:02:45.774
<v Speaker 3>19 and in the last 20 years I'm a law </v>
<v Speaker 3>was passed as a consequence of that </v>

1113
01:02:50.761 --> 01:02:51.594
<v Speaker 3>analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was that it was illegal to induct </v>

1114
01:02:53.311 --> 01:02:56.700
<v Speaker 3>anyone into the armed forces who had an </v>
<v Speaker 3>Iq of less than 83.</v>

1115
01:02:57.990 --> 01:02:58.823
<v Speaker 3>Now the question is why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that answer was all of that effort </v>

1116
01:03:02.431 --> 01:03:06.120
<v Speaker 3>put in by the armed forces indicated </v>
<v Speaker 3>that if you had an Iq of 83 or less,</v>

1117
01:03:06.121 --> 01:03:06.954
<v Speaker 3>there wasn't anything that you could be </v>
<v Speaker 3>trained to do in the military that </v>

1118
01:03:08.941 --> 01:03:12.810
<v Speaker 3>wasn't positively counterproductive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you got to think about that a,</v>

1119
01:03:12.811 --> 01:03:17.420
<v Speaker 3>because the military is chronically </v>
<v Speaker 3>desperate for people right there.</v>

1120
01:03:17.421 --> 01:03:20.760
<v Speaker 3>It's not like they're sort of like </v>
<v Speaker 3>people are lining up to be inducted,</v>

1121
01:03:21.090 --> 01:03:23.070
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have to go out and recruit and it's</v>

1122
01:03:23.071 --> 01:03:23.904
<v Speaker 3>not easy and so they're desperate to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>their hands on every body they can </v>

1123
01:03:26.641 --> 01:03:30.170
<v Speaker 3>possibly manage and then especially in </v>
<v Speaker 3>wartime,</v>

1124
01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:32.730
<v Speaker 3>but also in peace time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then there was another reason too,</v>

1125
01:03:32.731 --> 01:03:33.564
<v Speaker 3>which was the armed forces,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was also set up from a policy </v>

1126
01:03:35.431 --> 01:03:38.820
<v Speaker 3>perspective to take people in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>underclass,</v>

1127
01:03:38.821 --> 01:03:41.760
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and train them and move them up at least</v>

1128
01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:43.500
<v Speaker 3>into the working class or maybe the </v>
<v Speaker 3>middle class.</v>

1129
01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:47.040
<v Speaker 3>So there's a policy element to it too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so even from that perspective,</v>

1130
01:03:47.041 --> 01:03:50.190
<v Speaker 3>you can see that the military is </v>
<v Speaker 3>desperate to bring people in,</v>

1131
01:03:50.790 --> 01:03:54.000
<v Speaker 3>but it all with an Iq of 83 or less,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not happening.</v>

1132
01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:55.913
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so how many people have an Iq of 83 or </v>

1133
01:03:57.301 --> 01:03:58.134
<v Speaker 3>less?</v>

1134
01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:00.080
<v Speaker 2>Ten percent.</v>

1135
01:04:02.410 --> 01:04:03.730
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that doesn't,</v>

1136
01:04:06.130 --> 01:04:10.270
<v Speaker 3>if that doesn't hurt you to hear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you didn't hear it properly.</v>

1137
01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:15.610
<v Speaker 3>Because what it implies is that in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>complex society like ours and one that's</v>

1138
01:04:15.611 --> 01:04:16.444
<v Speaker 3>becoming increasingly complex,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there isn't anything for 10 percent of </v>

1139
01:04:19.871 --> 01:04:22.960
<v Speaker 3>the population to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alright,</v>

1140
01:04:23.020 --> 01:04:24.820
<v Speaker 3>well what are we going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to ignore that.</v>

1141
01:04:25.420 --> 01:04:27.730
<v Speaker 3>We're going to run away from that and </v>
<v Speaker 3>believe me,</v>

1142
01:04:27.731 --> 01:04:28.564
<v Speaker 3>we have every reason to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or we're going to contend with the fact </v>

1143
01:04:30.821 --> 01:04:34.090
<v Speaker 3>that we need to figure out how it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how it is,</v>

1144
01:04:34.180 --> 01:04:35.013
<v Speaker 3>how it might be possible to find a place</v>
<v Speaker 3>for people on the lower end of the </v>

1145
01:04:40.091 --> 01:04:45.091
<v Speaker 3>general cognitive distribution to take </v>
<v Speaker 3>their productive and worthwhile place in</v>

1146
01:04:45.281 --> 01:04:47.740
<v Speaker 3>society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that isn't just going to be a matter</v>

1147
01:04:47.741 --> 01:04:48.574
<v Speaker 3>of dumping money down the hierarchy </v>
<v Speaker 3>because giving people who have nothing </v>

1148
01:04:52.091 --> 01:04:55.150
<v Speaker 3>to do money isn't helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't work.</v>

1149
01:04:55.180 --> 01:04:58.060
<v Speaker 3>It's not that simple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1150
01:04:58.750 --> 01:04:59.583
<v Speaker 3>so that's kind of an answer to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>question of whether or not we should </v>

1151
01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:02.410
<v Speaker 3>deal with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1152
01:05:02.410 --> 01:05:04.480
<v Speaker 3>with Iq forthrightly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1153
01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:08.890
<v Speaker 3>if you can find a flaw in that logic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like just go right ahead.</v>

1154
01:05:08.891 --> 01:05:12.220
<v Speaker 3>It's not like I was thrilled to death to</v>
<v Speaker 3>discover all of this by nose,</v>

1155
01:05:12.221 --> 01:05:14.800
<v Speaker 3>by no stretch of the imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was that the case?</v>

1156
01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:17.890
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what?</v>

1157
01:05:17.891 --> 01:05:22.030
<v Speaker 3>So Iq is reliable and valid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the first thing.</v>

1158
01:05:22.060 --> 01:05:26.230
<v Speaker 3>It's more reliable and valid than any </v>
<v Speaker 3>other psychometric test ever designed by</v>

1159
01:05:26.231 --> 01:05:29.710
<v Speaker 3>social scientists by a factor of about </v>
<v Speaker 3>three.</v>

1160
01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:31.353
<v Speaker 3>That's fact number one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fact number two is it predicts longterm </v>

1161
01:05:34.751 --> 01:05:38.020
<v Speaker 3>life outcome at about point three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>point four,</v>

1162
01:05:38.260 --> 01:05:39.093
<v Speaker 3>which leaves about 85 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>70 to 85 percent of the story </v>

1163
01:05:41.801 --> 01:05:42.634
<v Speaker 3>unexplained,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's still the best thing that we </v>

1164
01:05:44.591 --> 01:05:45.940
<v Speaker 3>have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1165
01:05:45.941 --> 01:05:48.670
<v Speaker 3>it's also the case that in places like </v>
<v Speaker 3>Great Britain,</v>

1166
01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:50.313
<v Speaker 3>when Iq tests were first introduced,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were actually used by the </v>

1167
01:05:52.811 --> 01:05:53.644
<v Speaker 3>socialists and they were used to </v>
<v Speaker 3>identify poor people who had potential </v>

1168
01:05:59.020 --> 01:05:59.853
<v Speaker 3>cognitive potential and to move them </v>
<v Speaker 3>into higher Ed Institutes of higher </v>

1169
01:06:02.891 --> 01:06:03.724
<v Speaker 3>education.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's an upside social upside as </v>

1170
01:06:06.641 --> 01:06:09.700
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ethnic differences.</v>

1171
01:06:12.190 --> 01:06:13.023
<v Speaker 3>This is something you can't say anything</v>
<v Speaker 3>about without without immediately being </v>

1172
01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:20.380
<v Speaker 3>killed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm hesitant to broach the topic,</v>

1173
01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:21.513
<v Speaker 3>but I'll tell you one thing that I did </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the last week that's relevant to </v>

1174
01:06:24.131 --> 01:06:25.510
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>

1175
01:06:25.710 --> 01:06:28.180
<v Speaker 3>and this just shows you how complex the </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem is.</v>

1176
01:06:28.270 --> 01:06:29.103
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we should point out that race is a very </v>

1177
01:06:30.461 --> 01:06:33.400
<v Speaker 3>difficult thing to define because racial</v>
<v Speaker 3>boundaries aren't tight,</v>

1178
01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:34.773
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So and so when you talk about racial </v>

1179
01:06:36.581 --> 01:06:37.900
<v Speaker 3>differences in Iq,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1180
01:06:38.020 --> 01:06:41.680
<v Speaker 3>you're faced with a thorny problem of </v>
<v Speaker 3>defining race and now it's a big problem</v>

1181
01:06:41.681 --> 01:06:42.514
<v Speaker 3>from a scientific perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we'll leave that aside and I wrote </v>

1182
01:06:46.331 --> 01:06:50.650
<v Speaker 3>an article this week,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody stood up at one point,</v>

1183
01:06:50.660 --> 01:06:54.550
<v Speaker 3>one of my talks and vice bless their </v>
<v Speaker 3>hearts,</v>

1184
01:06:54.970 --> 01:06:55.803
<v Speaker 3>took this particular question and used </v>
<v Speaker 3>it as an indication of the quality of </v>

1185
01:06:59.261 --> 01:07:01.510
<v Speaker 3>the people who are my so called </v>
<v Speaker 3>followers.</v>

1186
01:07:01.511 --> 01:07:04.240
<v Speaker 3>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the quality of my so called followers is</v>

1187
01:07:04.241 --> 01:07:05.290
<v Speaker 3>pretty damn high.</v>

1188
01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:06.393
<v Speaker 3>And you can find that out quite rapidly </v>
<v Speaker 3>just by going looking at the youtube </v>

1189
01:07:09.431 --> 01:07:10.264
<v Speaker 3>comments which are head and shoulders </v>
<v Speaker 3>above what the standard set of youtube </v>

1190
01:07:13.511 --> 01:07:14.890
<v Speaker 3>comments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can tell you that.</v>

1191
01:07:15.910 --> 01:07:19.240
<v Speaker 3>So someone asked me the both the Jewish </v>
<v Speaker 3>question,</v>

1192
01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:20.740
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>

1193
01:07:20.830 --> 01:07:25.830
<v Speaker 3>the implication it was actually someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jewish and the implication was that Jews</v>

1194
01:07:26.051 --> 01:07:30.670
<v Speaker 3>are overrepresented in positions of </v>
<v Speaker 3>authority and power and,</v>

1195
01:07:31.270 --> 01:07:32.103
<v Speaker 3>and I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had just spoken for like an hour and a </v>

1196
01:07:34.391 --> 01:07:35.224
<v Speaker 3>half and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy had an ax to grind and I </v>

1197
01:07:37.001 --> 01:07:39.970
<v Speaker 3>thought there is no God damn way I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting into this at the moment.</v>

1198
01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:41.990
<v Speaker 3>And so I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said I'm,</v>

1199
01:07:42.190 --> 01:07:45.640
<v Speaker 3>I said I can't answer that question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's not a very good answer.</v>

1200
01:07:45.641 --> 01:07:47.830
<v Speaker 3>So I wrote a blog post this week and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

1201
01:07:47.831 --> 01:07:48.640
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the,</v>

1202
01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:50.530
<v Speaker 3>here's the situation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

1203
01:07:51.580 --> 01:07:54.730
<v Speaker 3>Jews are overrepresented in positions of</v>
<v Speaker 3>power and authority,</v>

1204
01:07:55.090 --> 01:07:57.250
<v Speaker 3>but then let's open our eyes a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>bit.</v>

1205
01:07:57.250 --> 01:07:59.890
<v Speaker 3>Hey and thank for like two or three </v>
<v Speaker 3>seconds and think,</v>

1206
01:08:00.010 --> 01:08:00.843
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>guess what?</v>

1207
01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:01.833
<v Speaker 3>They're also overrepresented in </v>
<v Speaker 3>positions of competence and it's not </v>

1208
01:08:04.691 --> 01:08:08.020
<v Speaker 3>like we have more geniuses than we know </v>
<v Speaker 3>what to do with.</v>

1209
01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:10.570
<v Speaker 3>And if the Jews happened to be producing</v>
<v Speaker 3>more of them,</v>

1210
01:08:10.630 --> 01:08:11.950
<v Speaker 3>which they are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

1211
01:08:12.010 --> 01:08:14.560
<v Speaker 3>then that's a pretty good thing for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rest of us.</v>

1212
01:08:14.740 --> 01:08:17.570
<v Speaker 3>So let's not confuse competence with </v>
<v Speaker 3>power and authority,</v>

1213
01:08:17.571 --> 01:08:18.404
<v Speaker 3>even though that's a favorite trick of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the radical leftists who always failed </v>

1214
01:08:21.111 --> 01:08:22.970
<v Speaker 3>to make that distinction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1215
01:08:23.180 --> 01:08:28.180
<v Speaker 3>why does this over representation occur?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it does it also.</v>

1216
01:08:28.340 --> 01:08:31.640
<v Speaker 3>There's also overrepresentation in </v>
<v Speaker 3>political movements,</v>

1217
01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:34.430
<v Speaker 3>including radical political movements.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

1218
01:08:34.431 --> 01:08:35.360
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1219
01:08:35.361 --> 01:08:38.720
<v Speaker 3>answer one Jewish conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1220
01:08:38.721 --> 01:08:41.150
<v Speaker 3>That's not a very good answer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've had,</v>

1221
01:08:41.151 --> 01:08:43.740
<v Speaker 3>we've used that answer before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alright,</v>

1222
01:08:43.820 --> 01:08:45.920
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but do we have an alternative?</v>

1223
01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:47.300
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's an alternative.</v>

1224
01:08:48.260 --> 01:08:52.580
<v Speaker 3>The average Ashkenazi Iq is somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 3>between 1:10 and one slash 15,</v>

1225
01:08:53.030 --> 01:08:56.750
<v Speaker 3>which is about one standard deviation </v>
<v Speaker 3>above the population average.</v>

1226
01:08:56.870 --> 01:09:01.870
<v Speaker 3>And so what that means is that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>average Ashkenazi Slash European Jew has</v>

1227
01:09:02.361 --> 01:09:07.361
<v Speaker 3>an Iq that's higher than 85 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the population that's a lot higher now.</v>

1228
01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:12.710
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't make that much difference </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the middle of the distribution.</v>

1229
01:09:12.830 --> 01:09:13.663
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But geniuses don't exist at the middle </v>

1230
01:09:15.411 --> 01:09:16.244
<v Speaker 3>of the distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They exist at the tails of the </v>

1231
01:09:18.141 --> 01:09:18.974
<v Speaker 3>distribution and you don't need much of </v>
<v Speaker 3>a move at the mean to produce walloping </v>

1232
01:09:23.811 --> 01:09:24.644
<v Speaker 3>differences at the tails.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the tails are important because a </v>

1233
01:09:27.201 --> 01:09:28.034
<v Speaker 3>lot of where we draw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we draw exceptional people from the </v>

1234
01:09:31.401 --> 01:09:33.170
<v Speaker 3>exceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1235
01:09:33.171 --> 01:09:34.004
<v Speaker 3>So here's an example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's another example of the same </v>

1236
01:09:35.331 --> 01:09:38.540
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most engineers are male.</v>

1237
01:09:39.530 --> 01:09:40.363
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because men are more interested in </v>

1238
01:09:42.411 --> 01:09:46.040
<v Speaker 3>things and women are more interested in </v>
<v Speaker 3>people and you might say,</v>

1239
01:09:46.041 --> 01:09:47.750
<v Speaker 3>well that's sociocultural.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1240
01:09:48.110 --> 01:09:49.340
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>

1241
01:09:49.610 --> 01:09:53.500
<v Speaker 3>And we know that because if you stack up</v>
<v Speaker 3>countries by their,</v>

1242
01:09:53.660 --> 01:09:56.330
<v Speaker 3>by their egalitarianism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>social policies,</v>

1243
01:09:56.450 --> 01:09:58.220
<v Speaker 3>which you can do quite effectively.</v>

1244
01:09:58.370 --> 01:09:59.203
<v Speaker 3>And then you look at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>overrepresentation of men in stem </v>

1245
01:10:02.211 --> 01:10:03.044
<v Speaker 3>fields,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the overrepresentation increases as the </v>

1246
01:10:05.901 --> 01:10:10.790
<v Speaker 3>countries become more egalitarian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's not socio cultural,</v>

1247
01:10:11.210 --> 01:10:14.810
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now men aren't that much more interested</v>

1248
01:10:14.811 --> 01:10:17.300
<v Speaker 3>in things than women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one standard deviation,</v>

1249
01:10:17.301 --> 01:10:19.190
<v Speaker 3>which is about the same difference by </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way,</v>

1250
01:10:19.250 --> 01:10:21.770
<v Speaker 3>between the population norm in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Ashkenazi Jews.</v>

1251
01:10:22.010 --> 01:10:22.843
<v Speaker 3>But if you're looking at the person who </v>
<v Speaker 3>the one person in 20 or the one person </v>

1252
01:10:26.271 --> 01:10:31.271
<v Speaker 3>in 50 who's most who's hyper interested </v>
<v Speaker 3>in things and that's likely to become an</v>

1253
01:10:32.241 --> 01:10:34.670
<v Speaker 3>engineer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then most of them are men.</v>

1254
01:10:35.150 --> 01:10:37.130
<v Speaker 3>Here's another example of the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

1255
01:10:37.970 --> 01:10:38.803
<v Speaker 3>Men are more aggressive than women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you might ask how much and now </v>

1256
01:10:44.060 --> 01:10:46.340
<v Speaker 3>answered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is best place to look at that as in</v>

1257
01:10:46.341 --> 01:10:47.174
<v Speaker 3>Sweden where the egalitarian policies </v>
<v Speaker 3>have been laid out for a long period of </v>

1258
01:10:50.241 --> 01:10:51.074
<v Speaker 3>time and you can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can get a more direct inference </v>

1259
01:10:53.031 --> 01:10:53.864
<v Speaker 3>about biology.</v>

1260
01:10:54.290 --> 01:10:55.123
<v Speaker 3>If you took a random man in around </v>
<v Speaker 3>random woman out of the population and </v>

1261
01:10:58.611 --> 01:10:59.444
<v Speaker 3>you had to bet on who was more </v>
<v Speaker 3>aggressive and you bet on the man you'd </v>

1262
01:11:01.761 --> 01:11:05.060
<v Speaker 3>be right 60 percent of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's not that much,</v>

1263
01:11:05.061 --> 01:11:05.511
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1264
01:11:05.511 --> 01:11:08.930
<v Speaker 3>it's deviates from 50 slash 50,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not like 90 10.</v>

1265
01:11:08.931 --> 01:11:10.820
<v Speaker 3>It's 60 slash 40.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1266
01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:13.440
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what does that mean?</v>

1267
01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:15.840
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got a tail problem here.</v>

1268
01:11:15.841 --> 01:11:16.674
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say that now you decide to go out </v>

1269
01:11:18.121 --> 01:11:18.954
<v Speaker 3>onto the extremes of aggression and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>identify the most aggressive one in 100 </v>

1270
01:11:23.221 --> 01:11:25.970
<v Speaker 3>persons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're all men.</v>

1271
01:11:26.990 --> 01:11:30.180
<v Speaker 3>Guess who's in prison?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those people.</v>

1272
01:11:30.660 --> 01:11:33.480
<v Speaker 3>That's why most of the people in prison </v>
<v Speaker 3>are men.</v>

1273
01:11:34.060 --> 01:11:34.893
<v Speaker 3>And so this is elementary part of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem in our society is that we don't </v>

1274
01:11:38.371 --> 01:11:39.204
<v Speaker 3>understand statistics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't understand that you can have </v>

1275
01:11:41.701 --> 01:11:42.534
<v Speaker 3>relatively small differences at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>population level that produce walloping </v>

1276
01:11:46.741 --> 01:11:49.410
<v Speaker 3>consequences at the tails of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>distribution.</v>

1277
01:11:50.190 --> 01:11:51.750
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So back to ICU.</v>

1278
01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:56.000
<v Speaker 3>One final thing to say about Iq.</v>

1279
01:11:57.780 --> 01:12:01.560
<v Speaker 3>The ethnic differences are difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 3>dispense with.</v>

1280
01:12:02.550 --> 01:12:05.370
<v Speaker 3>It's not easy to make them go away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can say,</v>

1281
01:12:05.371 --> 01:12:09.120
<v Speaker 3>well the tests aren't culture fair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well here's the past of that.</v>

1282
01:12:09.121 --> 01:12:12.600
<v Speaker 3>So imagine you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you task group a with an Iq test and you</v>

1283
01:12:12.601 --> 01:12:13.434
<v Speaker 3>test group B with an Iq test and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>you look at their actual performance in </v>

1284
01:12:17.641 --> 01:12:18.474
<v Speaker 3>whatever you're predicting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If the test was biased against ethnic </v>

1285
01:12:21.571 --> 01:12:22.404
<v Speaker 3>group A,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it would under predict their </v>

1286
01:12:24.301 --> 01:12:28.260
<v Speaker 3>performance and that doesn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you could say,</v>

1287
01:12:28.261 --> 01:12:30.330
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's systemic bias in the performance</v>

1288
01:12:30.331 --> 01:12:34.230
<v Speaker 3>measures and the potential measures and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a possibility.</v>

1289
01:12:34.900 --> 01:12:38.370
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now one other thing about that.</v>

1290
01:12:40.020 --> 01:12:40.853
<v Speaker 3>There's a real danger in the ethnicity </v>
<v Speaker 3>Iq debate and the danger is that we </v>

1291
01:12:45.810 --> 01:12:46.643
<v Speaker 3>confuse intelligence with value or that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we include we we confuse intelligence </v>

1292
01:12:53.041 --> 01:12:56.040
<v Speaker 3>with yet with human value.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a better way of thinking about it</v>

1293
01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:57.233
<v Speaker 3>and one of the things that we're going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to have to understand here is that </v>

1294
01:13:00.541 --> 01:13:01.374
<v Speaker 3>that's a mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that being more intelligent doesn't </v>

1295
01:13:03.571 --> 01:13:04.980
<v Speaker 3>make you a better person.</v>

1296
01:13:05.610 --> 01:13:06.443
<v Speaker 3>That's not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes you more useful for complex </v>

1297
01:13:08.761 --> 01:13:13.140
<v Speaker 3>cognitive operations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can be pretty damn horrific as a</v>

1298
01:13:13.141 --> 01:13:15.420
<v Speaker 3>genius son of a bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1299
01:13:15.421 --> 01:13:16.254
<v Speaker 3>It's morally neutral,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we also know that from the </v>

1300
01:13:17.731 --> 01:13:19.020
<v Speaker 3>psychometric data.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>

1301
01:13:19.021 --> 01:13:19.854
<v Speaker 3>there doesn't seem to be any </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship whatsoever between </v>

1302
01:13:21.271 --> 01:13:22.104
<v Speaker 3>intelligence and virtue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so if it does turn out that nature </v>

1303
01:13:26.131 --> 01:13:29.970
<v Speaker 3>and the fates do not align with our </v>
<v Speaker 3>egalitarianism presuppositions,</v>

1304
01:13:29.971 --> 01:13:30.804
<v Speaker 3>which is highly probable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we shouldn't therefore make the mistake </v>

1305
01:13:33.061 --> 01:13:38.061
<v Speaker 3>of assuming that if group a or person a </v>
<v Speaker 3>is lower on one of these attributes than</v>

1306
01:13:38.761 --> 01:13:42.390
<v Speaker 3>group B or person b,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that is somehow reflective of their</v>

1307
01:13:42.391 --> 01:13:45.510
<v Speaker 3>intrinsic value as human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a big mistake.</v>

1308
01:13:50.910 --> 01:13:52.890
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why I don't have anything else to</v>

1309
01:13:52.891 --> 01:13:55.890
<v Speaker 3>say about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1310
01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:57.220
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1311
01:13:57.480 --> 01:14:02.480
<v Speaker 3>I had three more questions and so maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>slightly shorter answers to these three,</v>

1312
01:14:03.211 --> 01:14:05.760
<v Speaker 3>like maybe around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hopefully there are simpler questions.</v>

1313
01:14:07.730 --> 01:14:09.300
<v Speaker 3>Average,</v>
<v Speaker 3>average five minutes.</v>

1314
01:14:09.830 --> 01:14:10.950
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then.</v>

1315
01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:12.190
<v Speaker 3>And then we will open it up.</v>

1316
01:14:12.190 --> 01:14:17.190
<v Speaker 1>So another taboo is to celebrate </v>
<v Speaker 1>European culture.</v>

1317
01:14:19.390 --> 01:14:24.390
<v Speaker 1>Multiculturalists get pretty unhappy </v>
<v Speaker 1>when Europeans start expressing pride in</v>

1318
01:14:24.641 --> 01:14:27.040
<v Speaker 1>their culture or heritage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many,</v>

1319
01:14:27.041 --> 01:14:30.580
<v Speaker 1>especially on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do not draw much of a distinction,</v>

1320
01:14:30.610 --> 01:14:34.600
<v Speaker 1>at least in practice between European </v>
<v Speaker 1>pride and white supremacy.</v>

1321
01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:37.540
<v Speaker 1>You care about freedom of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual,</v>

1322
01:14:37.780 --> 01:14:40.720
<v Speaker 1>the individual's freedom to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to speak,</v>

1323
01:14:40.750 --> 01:14:41.583
<v Speaker 1>to associate in short,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to act as he sees fit without external </v>

1324
01:14:45.131 --> 01:14:45.964
<v Speaker 1>compulsion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as he doesn't infringe on the </v>

1325
01:14:47.831 --> 01:14:52.050
<v Speaker 1>similar liberties of others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Professor Ricardo do shame.</v>

1326
01:14:52.370 --> 01:14:53.203
<v Speaker 1>A historical sociologists and professor </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the University of New Brunswick </v>

1327
01:14:55.931 --> 01:14:56.764
<v Speaker 1>argues that quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>individualism is a unique attribute of </v>

1328
01:15:00.251 --> 01:15:02.980
<v Speaker 1>European peoples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quote,</v>

1329
01:15:03.190 --> 01:15:06.130
<v Speaker 1>it has been exported to some degree to </v>
<v Speaker 1>other nations,</v>

1330
01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:07.113
<v Speaker 1>but in my view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is not something that comes to them </v>

1331
01:15:09.161 --> 01:15:12.070
<v Speaker 1>naturally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he continues.</v>

1332
01:15:12.190 --> 01:15:13.023
<v Speaker 1>Quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't play the game of we're all </v>

1333
01:15:15.341 --> 01:15:16.174
<v Speaker 1>individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to affirm and be proud of our </v>

1334
01:15:19.301 --> 01:15:24.301
<v Speaker 1>ethnic identity and heritage to preserve</v>
<v Speaker 1>the West's curious individualism.</v>

1335
01:15:25.510 --> 01:15:28.090
<v Speaker 1>If Europeans have become minorities in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the west,</v>

1336
01:15:28.300 --> 01:15:32.740
<v Speaker 1>he argues the founding idea of the West,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that no entity,</v>

1337
01:15:33.070 --> 01:15:34.750
<v Speaker 1>not an individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a community,</v>

1338
01:15:34.751 --> 01:15:38.440
<v Speaker 1>not the state congested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We deprive an individual of life,</v>

1339
01:15:38.441 --> 01:15:40.360
<v Speaker 1>liberty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or property by force,</v>

1340
01:15:40.570 --> 01:15:43.210
<v Speaker 1>no matter what the individual's race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>class or religion.</v>

1341
01:15:45.310 --> 01:15:48.130
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be surprised if Dushane when </v>
<v Speaker 1>he made this statement,</v>

1342
01:15:48.131 --> 01:15:49.120
<v Speaker 1>had you in mind.</v>

1343
01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:54.110
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the</v>

1344
01:15:55.180 --> 01:15:56.013
<v Speaker 3>medieval Europeans identified seven </v>
<v Speaker 3>deadly sins for reason and one of them </v>

1345
01:16:00.731 --> 01:16:03.190
<v Speaker 3>was pride.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1346
01:16:04.030 --> 01:16:04.863
<v Speaker 3>let's make the presumption.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do believe that for for reasons that </v>

1347
01:16:09.341 --> 01:16:14.080
<v Speaker 3>aren't obvious that the west has got </v>
<v Speaker 3>some things right.</v>

1348
01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:16.450
<v Speaker 3>We've got the sovereignty of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>individual,</v>

1349
01:16:16.451 --> 01:16:17.284
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the most fundamental thing we've </v>

1350
01:16:19.331 --> 01:16:19.900
<v Speaker 3>got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1351
01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:23.110
<v Speaker 3>We've articulated that I think in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a remarkable way,</v>

1352
01:16:23.111 --> 01:16:23.944
<v Speaker 3>not only theologically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>philosophically in her body of laws and </v>

1353
01:16:28.091 --> 01:16:28.924
<v Speaker 3>our societies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and one of the consequences of that as </v>

1354
01:16:30.971 --> 01:16:35.560
<v Speaker 3>it's had its effect on the rest of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world is that everyone is getting richer</v>

1355
01:16:35.561 --> 01:16:37.990
<v Speaker 3>quite fast and that's a really good </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

1356
01:16:38.850 --> 01:16:40.300
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Having said that,</v>

1357
01:16:40.301 --> 01:16:41.650
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>am I proud of that?</v>

1358
01:16:41.950 --> 01:16:43.570
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't do that.</v>

1359
01:16:44.950 --> 01:16:46.570
<v Speaker 3>What the hell?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pride.</v>

1360
01:16:47.260 --> 01:16:50.530
<v Speaker 3>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not the right response.</v>

1361
01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:53.470
<v Speaker 3>How about responsibility for that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How would that be?</v>

1362
01:16:53.650 --> 01:16:56.230
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're a part of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is great</v>

1363
01:16:58.120 --> 01:16:58.953
<v Speaker 3>and unlikely set of propositions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This strange set of propositions that </v>

1364
01:17:03.011 --> 01:17:08.011
<v Speaker 3>says that in some ineffable manner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the poorest person is as valuable as the</v>

1365
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:11.240
<v Speaker 4>king.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1366
01:17:11.241 --> 01:17:12.950
<v Speaker 4>how the hell did we ever figure that </v>
<v Speaker 4>out?</v>

1367
01:17:13.550 --> 01:17:16.340
<v Speaker 4>That's an impossible thing to think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and yet that's the,</v>

1368
01:17:16.580 --> 01:17:20.210
<v Speaker 4>that's the bedrock of our legal system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's nothing to be proud of.</v>

1369
01:17:20.390 --> 01:17:21.223
<v Speaker 4>That's something to tremble before to </v>
<v Speaker 4>take on as an ethical burden and not to </v>

1370
01:17:26.241 --> 01:17:27.074
<v Speaker 4>wave a flag for how wonderful you are </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you happened to have the same skin </v>

1371
01:17:29.871 --> 01:17:32.690
<v Speaker 4>color as some of the people who thought </v>
<v Speaker 4>that up.</v>

1372
01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:35.640
<v Speaker 4>It's not the right response.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's,</v>

1373
01:17:35.850 --> 01:17:40.610
<v Speaker 4>it's to open your eyes and recognize </v>
<v Speaker 4>that as a miracle and a relatively,</v>

1374
01:17:40.950 --> 01:17:41.783
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>relatively new miracle on the world </v>

1375
01:17:42.981 --> 01:17:43.814
<v Speaker 4>stage and to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and to participate in the process of </v>

1376
01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:49.010
<v Speaker 4>upholding that in your personal and your</v>
<v Speaker 4>public life.</v>

1377
01:17:49.310 --> 01:17:50.143
<v Speaker 4>That's not pride in European tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when I go to Europe and I love </v>

1378
01:17:54.471 --> 01:17:58.790
<v Speaker 4>going to Europe and the European cities </v>
<v Speaker 4>are there unbelievable masterpieces,</v>

1379
01:17:58.791 --> 01:18:02.000
<v Speaker 4>which is why they're completely flooded </v>
<v Speaker 4>by pilgrims,</v>

1380
01:18:02.001 --> 01:18:02.420
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1381
01:18:02.420 --> 01:18:03.253
<v Speaker 4>Tourists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pilgrims who go there to look at the </v>

1382
01:18:05.271 --> 01:18:06.200
<v Speaker 4>beauty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So again,</v>

1383
01:18:06.201 --> 01:18:08.780
<v Speaker 4>I don't feel pride about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel.</v>

1384
01:18:09.410 --> 01:18:13.700
<v Speaker 4>I feel like I have something to live up </v>
<v Speaker 4>to that's not the same thing man.</v>

1385
01:18:14.060 --> 01:18:16.280
<v Speaker 4>And so these right wingers in this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

1386
01:18:16.281 --> 01:18:17.720
<v Speaker 4>look what we've done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1387
01:18:17.721 --> 01:18:20.150
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not you that did that.</v>

1388
01:18:21.170 --> 01:18:22.003
<v Speaker 4>That's something mad you gotta.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You GotTa have your act together before </v>

1389
01:18:24.741 --> 01:18:25.820
<v Speaker 4>you would dare to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1390
01:18:25.821 --> 01:18:26.960
<v Speaker 4>that was me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1391
01:18:26.961 --> 01:18:27.740
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sure,</v>

1392
01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:29.270
<v Speaker 4>sure it was you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1393
01:18:29.271 --> 01:18:30.780
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1394
01:18:31.270 --> 01:18:34.640
<v Speaker 4>it's hard to stand up and take your </v>
<v Speaker 4>place in that,</v>

1395
01:18:34.940 --> 01:18:38.450
<v Speaker 4>in that kind of historical process,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that unlikely,</v>

1396
01:18:38.451 --> 01:18:43.451
<v Speaker 4>miraculous historical process,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not to just feel ashamed at the way that</v>

1397
01:18:43.491 --> 01:18:46.890
<v Speaker 4>you're presently constituted in the face</v>
<v Speaker 4>of that means that you're.</v>

1398
01:18:46.940 --> 01:18:47.773
<v Speaker 4>You're diluted and you're using your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your your great fortune of being a </v>

1399
01:18:54.441 --> 01:18:57.710
<v Speaker 4>beneficiary of that system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at what we've got here,</v>

1400
01:18:57.810 --> 01:19:00.800
<v Speaker 4>this great pace that we're inhabiting </v>
<v Speaker 4>right now.</v>

1401
01:19:01.010 --> 01:19:03.170
<v Speaker 4>You're using your unearned,</v>

1402
01:19:07.060 --> 01:19:07.893
<v Speaker 4>the unearned gift that's been granted to</v>
<v Speaker 4>you as a source of personal pride in </v>

1403
01:19:12.131 --> 01:19:16.090
<v Speaker 4>your accomplishments do to your skin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1404
01:19:16.091 --> 01:19:18.130
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not good.</v>

1405
01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:20.650
<v Speaker 4>Not a good argument.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1406
01:19:21.210 --> 01:19:25.360
<v Speaker 4>and that doesn't mean that while there's</v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing valuable about European culture,</v>

1407
01:19:25.420 --> 01:19:28.960
<v Speaker 4>there's plenty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's plenty about it that's value.</v>

1408
01:19:29.050 --> 01:19:31.450
<v Speaker 4>It's not even so clear to what degree </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's European.</v>

1409
01:19:31.451 --> 01:19:32.980
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it came out of the Middle East,</v>

1410
01:19:32.981 --> 01:19:33.814
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mean who it's so muddle headed that you </v>

1411
01:19:37.871 --> 01:19:38.704
<v Speaker 4>hardly know where to start,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so hopefully that was less than five </v>

1412
01:19:42.131 --> 01:19:43.750
<v Speaker 4>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There we go.</v>

1413
01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:47.770
<v Speaker 4>Dispensed with the radical right wingers</v>
<v Speaker 4>in four minutes.</v>

1414
01:19:49.030 --> 01:19:49.863
<v Speaker 4>I've heard a number of interesting </v>
<v Speaker 4>things about Islam from you and one of </v>

1415
01:19:52.271 --> 01:19:54.580
<v Speaker 4>your intellectual soul.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nate's Camille Talia,</v>

1416
01:19:56.340 --> 01:19:57.173
<v Speaker 4>Talia says that men and women benefit in</v>
<v Speaker 4>many ways from living and largely </v>

1417
01:20:00.431 --> 01:20:01.264
<v Speaker 4>separate worlds as they did and </v>
<v Speaker 4>traditional European societies and </v>

1418
01:20:04.541 --> 01:20:06.970
<v Speaker 4>obviously as they do in much of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Muslim world.</v>

1419
01:20:08.190 --> 01:20:12.090
<v Speaker 1>Relatedly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Polya considers passionate masculinity a</v>

1420
01:20:12.091 --> 01:20:15.870
<v Speaker 1>critical force for defending,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sustaining and advancing civilization,</v>

1421
01:20:16.410 --> 01:20:20.640
<v Speaker 1>and she argues the passionate </v>
<v Speaker 1>masculinity while virtually moribund and</v>

1422
01:20:20.641 --> 01:20:24.900
<v Speaker 1>the western middle and upper classes is </v>
<v Speaker 1>alive and well in the Muslim world.</v>

1423
01:20:25.860 --> 01:20:29.550
<v Speaker 1>You have expressed some sympathy for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Muslim critique of the West.</v>

1424
01:20:29.730 --> 01:20:32.400
<v Speaker 1>It's godlessness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's spiritual void.</v>

1425
01:20:32.460 --> 01:20:33.293
<v Speaker 1>It's materialism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's technology induced removal from </v>

1426
01:20:36.031 --> 01:20:36.864
<v Speaker 1>life's elemental realities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've said it is extraordinarily naive </v>

1427
01:20:41.191 --> 01:20:42.024
<v Speaker 1>to believe that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the differences between European </v>

1428
01:20:43.921 --> 01:20:47.970
<v Speaker 1>culture and Islamic culture are not </v>
<v Speaker 1>about anything fundamental.</v>

1429
01:20:48.900 --> 01:20:52.680
<v Speaker 1>You've expressed concern that Islam is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>totalizing system,</v>

1430
01:20:53.070 --> 01:20:53.903
<v Speaker 1>and in a quote that stood out to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you said in a Patrion chat on youtube </v>

1431
01:20:58.561 --> 01:21:01.680
<v Speaker 1>that in your view quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only countries in the world that are</v>

1432
01:21:01.681 --> 01:21:02.514
<v Speaker 1>essentially worth living in in any real </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense are the ones that are predicated </v>

1433
01:21:06.571 --> 01:21:07.404
<v Speaker 1>on the Judeo Christian tradition and </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifested in the western body of laws </v>

1434
01:21:11.100 --> 01:21:13.680
<v Speaker 1>unquote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So an open ended question,</v>

1435
01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:14.753
<v Speaker 1>how would you synthesize your </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective on Islam and the fact that </v>

1436
01:21:17.851 --> 01:21:20.160
<v Speaker 1>the Muslim populations of Europe and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada,</v>

1437
01:21:20.420 --> 01:21:25.260
<v Speaker 1>a product of recent immigration are </v>
<v Speaker 1>growing and reproducing much faster than</v>

1438
01:21:25.261 --> 01:21:27.810
<v Speaker 1>the European descended populations in </v>
<v Speaker 1>these countries?</v>

1439
01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:30.753
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you guys already did spend a lot of </v>

1440
01:21:31.541 --> 01:21:33.460
<v Speaker 4>time coming up with troublesome </v>
<v Speaker 4>questions,</v>

1441
01:21:33.461 --> 01:21:34.294
<v Speaker 4>didn't you?</v>

1442
01:21:38.530 --> 01:21:41.390
<v Speaker 4>When we get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can see the problem is the problem.</v>

1443
01:21:41.750 --> 01:21:42.583
<v Speaker 4>One of the problems is is that I'm an </v>
<v Speaker 4>ignorant man and there's lots of things </v>

1444
01:21:46.041 --> 01:21:49.370
<v Speaker 4>that I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one I don't know.</v>

1445
01:21:49.460 --> 01:21:50.293
<v Speaker 4>I don't understand Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know enough about it to be an </v>

1446
01:21:53.751 --> 01:21:54.584
<v Speaker 4>intelligent commentary on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've done my best to peck away at the </v>

1447
01:21:58.971 --> 01:22:00.280
<v Speaker 4>edges,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

1448
01:22:00.350 --> 01:22:01.183
<v Speaker 4>it would require multiple years of study</v>
<v Speaker 4>to understand the similarities and </v>

1449
01:22:06.801 --> 01:22:07.634
<v Speaker 4>differences between the two viewpoints.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looks to me like what Islam did was </v>

1450
01:22:15.170 --> 01:22:16.003
<v Speaker 4>take a group of radically disparate </v>
<v Speaker 4>tribes and unite them under a single </v>

1451
01:22:22.970 --> 01:22:24.860
<v Speaker 4>ethos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course,</v>

1452
01:22:24.861 --> 01:22:29.270
<v Speaker 4>the in the Muslim civilization expanded </v>
<v Speaker 4>more rapidly than any other civilization</v>

1453
01:22:29.271 --> 01:22:31.170
<v Speaker 4>ever had and and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1454
01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:33.380
<v Speaker 4>and occupied a very large part of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world,</v>

1455
01:22:33.381 --> 01:22:38.381
<v Speaker 4>which of course it still does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Perhaps there's something to be said for</v>

1456
01:22:39.081 --> 01:22:44.081
<v Speaker 4>that unifying tendency.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is a problem</v>

1457
01:22:54.770 --> 01:22:56.780
<v Speaker 4>and maybe this is at the core of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>problem.</v>

1458
01:22:57.540 --> 01:23:02.540
<v Speaker 4>There is no distinction between Church </v>
<v Speaker 4>and state in Islam</v>

1459
01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:07.180
<v Speaker 4>and there is a between church and state </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the West.</v>

1460
01:23:09.250 --> 01:23:10.083
<v Speaker 4>It isn't obvious to me if it's the case </v>
<v Speaker 4>that our culture is grounded in an </v>

1461
01:23:16.471 --> 01:23:19.790
<v Speaker 4>underlying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's call it literary metaphysics,</v>

1462
01:23:19.791 --> 01:23:21.990
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A religious metaphysic.</v>

1463
01:23:24.050 --> 01:23:24.883
<v Speaker 4>Part of the bedrock of our culture is </v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea of the separation between </v>

1464
01:23:28.611 --> 01:23:31.760
<v Speaker 4>church and state and as far as I can </v>
<v Speaker 4>tell,</v>

1465
01:23:32.300 --> 01:23:33.133
<v Speaker 4>that idea doesn't exist in the Muslim </v>
<v Speaker 4>world and so I cannot understand how </v>

1466
01:23:37.041 --> 01:23:41.180
<v Speaker 4>that faith is commensurate with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>institution's of the West.</v>

1467
01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:43.193
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't seem to me that there's any </v>
<v Speaker 4>evidence that it's commensurate because </v>

1468
01:23:46.510 --> 01:23:51.120
<v Speaker 4>the number of Islamic democracies is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's call it finite.</v>

1469
01:23:52.140 --> 01:23:57.030
<v Speaker 4>The best example is probably been Turkey</v>
<v Speaker 4>and Turkey as far as I can tell,</v>

1470
01:23:57.480 --> 01:23:58.313
<v Speaker 4>isn't doing that well at the moment on </v>
<v Speaker 4>the Democratic Front and it looked like </v>

1471
01:24:01.771 --> 01:24:06.030
<v Speaker 4>the great shining hope and Lord that was</v>
<v Speaker 4>a consequence of secularization.</v>

1472
01:24:15.070 --> 01:24:15.903
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've spent a lot of time when I was </v>

1473
01:24:17.141 --> 01:24:17.974
<v Speaker 4>reading maps of meaning for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>looking for commonalities among </v>

1474
01:24:21.101 --> 01:24:25.150
<v Speaker 4>religious viewpoints and I was able to </v>
<v Speaker 4>find deep commonalities.</v>

1475
01:24:25.151 --> 01:24:28.810
<v Speaker 4>I thought between Buddhism and </v>
<v Speaker 4>Christianity and daoism and Christianity</v>

1476
01:24:28.811 --> 01:24:29.644
<v Speaker 4>and Hinduism and Christianity for that </v>
<v Speaker 4>matter was a lot harder when it came to </v>

1477
01:24:32.801 --> 01:24:35.860
<v Speaker 4>Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not a faith that's opened itself up</v>

1478
01:24:35.861 --> 01:24:37.990
<v Speaker 4>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't understand it well,</v>

1479
01:24:47.190 --> 01:24:48.023
<v Speaker 4>but I hope that people of goodwill</v>
<v Speaker 4>can build a bridge between the two </v>

1480
01:24:55.201 --> 01:24:59.970
<v Speaker 4>cultures because the alternative is to </v>
<v Speaker 4>glue me to contemplate,</v>

1481
01:25:06.100 --> 01:25:06.933
<v Speaker 1>and finally you've stated quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women are more agreeable by nature than </v>

1482
01:25:12.041 --> 01:25:15.580
<v Speaker 1>men and agreeable people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>compassionate toward those.</v>

1483
01:25:15.581 --> 01:25:19.780
<v Speaker 1>They see a suffering and that seems to </v>
<v Speaker 1>include any minority,</v>

1484
01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:24.640
<v Speaker 1>especially when you combine that with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of neo Marxist doctrine that claims</v>

1485
01:25:24.641 --> 01:25:28.360
<v Speaker 1>that anyone who has an advantage swiped </v>
<v Speaker 1>it unquote.</v>

1486
01:25:29.410 --> 01:25:34.180
<v Speaker 1>Women have been voting for a century now</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this you suggested in a patrion chat</v>

1487
01:25:34.450 --> 01:25:39.450
<v Speaker 1>may help to explain why in the West,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've collectively decided that quote,</v>

1488
01:25:39.820 --> 01:25:40.653
<v Speaker 1>egalitarianism and conflict avoidance </v>
<v Speaker 1>constitute the two highest virtues and </v>

1489
01:25:45.401 --> 01:25:49.030
<v Speaker 1>trump everything else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including free speech unquote.</v>

1490
01:25:50.590 --> 01:25:51.423
<v Speaker 1>You've said that in the West today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are perhaps for the first time in </v>

1491
01:25:55.151 --> 01:25:59.740
<v Speaker 1>history seeing on the political left or </v>
<v Speaker 1>on segments of the political left quote,</v>

1492
01:26:00.010 --> 01:26:03.130
<v Speaker 1>what a female totalitarianism would look</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1493
01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:04.273
<v Speaker 1>unquote</v>

1494
01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:05.833
<v Speaker 4>elaborate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did a research project with one of my </v>

1495
01:26:12.321 --> 01:26:13.154
<v Speaker 4>students.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We haven't published it unfortunately </v>

1496
01:26:15.021 --> 01:26:18.590
<v Speaker 4>for a variety of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's been quite ill and I've been quite</v>

1497
01:26:18.620 --> 01:26:19.453
<v Speaker 4>preoccupied.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So those are the two barriers at the </v>

1498
01:26:22.251 --> 01:26:23.084
<v Speaker 4>moment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the first thing we wanted to do was </v>

1499
01:26:25.311 --> 01:26:29.090
<v Speaker 4>to find out whether there was actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>such a thing as political correctness.</v>

1500
01:26:29.330 --> 01:26:31.880
<v Speaker 4>You can actually do that technically as </v>
<v Speaker 4>a social scientist.</v>

1501
01:26:31.881 --> 01:26:35.150
<v Speaker 4>So what you do is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is what we did is we got a group of</v>

1502
01:26:35.151 --> 01:26:35.984
<v Speaker 4>people together and we collected a whole</v>
<v Speaker 4>bunch of statements that seem to be </v>

1503
01:26:38.331 --> 01:26:41.060
<v Speaker 4>vaguely associated with the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 4>political correctness.</v>

1504
01:26:41.061 --> 01:26:41.894
<v Speaker 4>So maybe you could think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well it's a media construct and that's </v>

1505
01:26:43.611 --> 01:26:44.444
<v Speaker 4>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can go analyze media statements and </v>

1506
01:26:45.921 --> 01:26:46.754
<v Speaker 4>then you can collect ideas that seem to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be associated with whatever political </v>

1507
01:26:50.151 --> 01:26:54.170
<v Speaker 4>correctness is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We collected about 400 of those and then</v>

1508
01:26:54.171 --> 01:26:55.004
<v Speaker 4>we asked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we turned them into questions and we </v>

1509
01:26:56.451 --> 01:26:58.460
<v Speaker 4>asked a thousand people for their </v>
<v Speaker 4>opinions.</v>

1510
01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:03.200
<v Speaker 4>Then you can do this statistical process</v>
<v Speaker 4>called factor analysis and it's the same</v>

1511
01:27:03.201 --> 01:27:06.440
<v Speaker 4>thing that pulls out a single factor of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Iq from a group of questions.</v>

1512
01:27:06.441 --> 01:27:07.274
<v Speaker 4>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the same thing that produced the </v>

1513
01:27:08.181 --> 01:27:09.014
<v Speaker 4>big five personality model.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the factor analysis does is tell </v>

1514
01:27:12.111 --> 01:27:16.250
<v Speaker 4>you which quest if questions grouped </v>
<v Speaker 4>together.</v>

1515
01:27:16.820 --> 01:27:18.650
<v Speaker 4>So let's say you have an opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

1516
01:27:19.430 --> 01:27:20.570
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you have an opinion,</v>

1517
01:27:20.571 --> 01:27:21.590
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if there's 100 of you,</v>

1518
01:27:21.591 --> 01:27:22.424
<v Speaker 4>everyone who has an opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a also has an opinion be an opinion </v>

1519
01:27:24.531 --> 01:27:26.780
<v Speaker 4>seat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if that's the case,</v>

1520
01:27:26.781 --> 01:27:27.614
<v Speaker 4>then those clump together,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's something about them that's the </v>

1521
01:27:29.511 --> 01:27:30.770
<v Speaker 4>same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

1522
01:27:30.771 --> 01:27:34.400
<v Speaker 4>what we could have found was that when </v>
<v Speaker 4>we analyze these 400 questions,</v>

1523
01:27:34.401 --> 01:27:37.850
<v Speaker 4>there was like 50 clumps and so that </v>
<v Speaker 4>would have blown.</v>

1524
01:27:38.490 --> 01:27:42.050
<v Speaker 4>There's such a thing as political </v>
<v Speaker 4>correctness hypothesis out of the water,</v>

1525
01:27:42.230 --> 01:27:44.540
<v Speaker 4>but that isn't what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We found two clumps,</v>

1526
01:27:44.750 --> 01:27:45.583
<v Speaker 4>one of which looked like something like </v>
<v Speaker 4>moderate left and the other that looked </v>

1527
01:27:48.830 --> 01:27:51.800
<v Speaker 4>very much like totalitarian political </v>
<v Speaker 4>correctness.</v>

1528
01:27:52.430 --> 01:27:54.800
<v Speaker 4>And it was very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very robust finding.</v>

1529
01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:55.993
<v Speaker 4>And we replicated it as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She did this for her master's thesis by </v>

1530
01:27:58.701 --> 01:27:59.534
<v Speaker 4>the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1531
01:28:00.740 --> 01:28:03.350
<v Speaker 4>and then we looked at what predicted </v>
<v Speaker 4>these beliefs.</v>

1532
01:28:03.770 --> 01:28:04.603
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the correlation between the </v>

1533
01:28:05.931 --> 01:28:06.764
<v Speaker 4>moderate leftist clump of questions and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the radical leftist clump of questions </v>

1534
01:28:10.041 --> 01:28:13.760
<v Speaker 4>actually wasn't very high.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so one of the things that we surmise</v>

1535
01:28:13.761 --> 01:28:14.594
<v Speaker 4>is that there's an actual division on </v>
<v Speaker 4>the left between the moderates and the </v>

1536
01:28:16.941 --> 01:28:17.774
<v Speaker 4>radicals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's just not played itself out </v>

1537
01:28:20.331 --> 01:28:21.164
<v Speaker 4>and I think you can actually see that </v>
<v Speaker 4>happening by the proclivity of the </v>

1538
01:28:23.271 --> 01:28:26.510
<v Speaker 4>radical leftists to devour themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1539
01:28:26.511 --> 01:28:28.490
<v Speaker 4>So which happens on a very regular </v>
<v Speaker 4>basis,</v>

1540
01:28:28.670 --> 01:28:32.770
<v Speaker 4>or perhaps you can see it in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>proclivity of the radical left,</v>

1541
01:28:32.771 --> 01:28:33.604
<v Speaker 4>is to go after the moderates.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When the moderates criticize the </v>

1542
01:28:35.631 --> 01:28:37.070
<v Speaker 4>radicals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

1543
01:28:37.100 --> 01:28:39.590
<v Speaker 4>So there's two clumps to political </v>
<v Speaker 4>correctness.</v>

1544
01:28:40.070 --> 01:28:43.100
<v Speaker 4>Both of them were predicted by trait </v>
<v Speaker 4>agreeableness,</v>

1545
01:28:43.670 --> 01:28:46.430
<v Speaker 4>which is one of the traits that women </v>
<v Speaker 4>score higher on than men.</v>

1546
01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:48.620
<v Speaker 4>It's the antithesis of aggression by the</v>
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>

1547
01:28:49.100 --> 01:28:49.933
<v Speaker 4>And by also by being female,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was a real shock to us because </v>

1548
01:28:53.511 --> 01:28:54.344
<v Speaker 4>most of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so let's say females and males differ </v>

1549
01:28:56.211 --> 01:28:59.060
<v Speaker 4>with regards to some outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You try to figure out why that is.</v>

1550
01:28:59.180 --> 01:29:00.013
<v Speaker 4>It might be just because they're female.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's all sorts of things associated </v>

1551
01:29:02.641 --> 01:29:06.330
<v Speaker 4>with being female or male that are like </v>
<v Speaker 4>second order complications.</v>

1552
01:29:06.690 --> 01:29:09.660
<v Speaker 4>What we found almost invariably with the</v>
<v Speaker 4>personality literatures,</v>

1553
01:29:09.661 --> 01:29:10.494
<v Speaker 4>if you look at differences between men </v>
<v Speaker 4>and women and then you control for </v>

1554
01:29:12.991 --> 01:29:15.270
<v Speaker 4>personality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the differences go away.</v>

1555
01:29:15.450 --> 01:29:17.850
<v Speaker 4>So they're not differences between men </v>
<v Speaker 4>and women per se.</v>

1556
01:29:17.851 --> 01:29:19.860
<v Speaker 4>There are differences between </v>
<v Speaker 4>personality,</v>

1557
01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:22.120
<v Speaker 4>but with political correctness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we found ineffective,</v>

1558
01:29:22.121 --> 01:29:24.600
<v Speaker 4>effective agreeableness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was a pure personality affect.</v>

1559
01:29:24.750 --> 01:29:25.583
<v Speaker 4>Aaron didn't effective of being female.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we also found a pronounced effect of </v>

1560
01:29:28.831 --> 01:29:29.664
<v Speaker 4>having taken at least one seminar that </v>
<v Speaker 4>was politically correct in its </v>

1561
01:29:33.031 --> 01:29:35.190
<v Speaker 4>orientation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that had a walloping effect.</v>

1562
01:29:35.820 --> 01:29:40.800
<v Speaker 4>So there does seem to be something about</v>
<v Speaker 4>political according to that research,</v>

1563
01:29:40.801 --> 01:29:41.634
<v Speaker 4>which,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1564
01:29:41.770 --> 01:29:45.450
<v Speaker 4>it's all right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>try to rely on better research,</v>

1565
01:29:45.451 --> 01:29:48.850
<v Speaker 4>but none has been done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's the best that I got in.</v>

1566
01:29:48.910 --> 01:29:51.300
<v Speaker 4>And the woman who did this research is </v>
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>

1567
01:29:51.301 --> 01:29:54.330
<v Speaker 4>very smart and the study was well done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I think it's credible.</v>

1568
01:29:54.900 --> 01:29:55.733
<v Speaker 4>So I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the things that's interesting to </v>

1569
01:29:57.631 --> 01:30:00.650
<v Speaker 4>me about that is that it does tie into </v>
<v Speaker 4>the Freud,</v>

1570
01:30:00.660 --> 01:30:03.870
<v Speaker 4>the and nightmare of devouring mother </v>
<v Speaker 4>essentially,</v>

1571
01:30:03.871 --> 01:30:04.704
<v Speaker 4>which was Freud's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think signal contribution to </v>

1572
01:30:06.421 --> 01:30:07.550
<v Speaker 4>psychopathology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1573
01:30:07.551 --> 01:30:08.384
<v Speaker 4>for most,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most of Freud's clients were people who </v>

1574
01:30:10.381 --> 01:30:13.620
<v Speaker 4>were struggling to get out of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>clutches of their family.</v>

1575
01:30:13.950 --> 01:30:14.783
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And part of that is human beings are </v>

1576
01:30:16.111 --> 01:30:17.190
<v Speaker 4>very dependent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1577
01:30:17.191 --> 01:30:18.030
<v Speaker 4>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1578
01:30:18.090 --> 01:30:21.030
<v Speaker 4>because we have this incredibly long </v>
<v Speaker 4>period of development.</v>

1579
01:30:21.420 --> 01:30:24.360
<v Speaker 4>Thirty years maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but certainly 18 years,</v>

1580
01:30:24.361 --> 01:30:28.100
<v Speaker 4>and so it's hard to struggle up from </v>
<v Speaker 4>infancy,</v>

1581
01:30:28.260 --> 01:30:32.190
<v Speaker 4>mature and leave as an independent </v>
<v Speaker 4>creature and lots of people,</v>

1582
01:30:32.191 --> 01:30:33.840
<v Speaker 4>you see this in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're a clinician,</v>

1583
01:30:33.841 --> 01:30:34.740
<v Speaker 4>you see this all the time.</v>

1584
01:30:34.740 --> 01:30:35.573
<v Speaker 4>People are so tangled up in their </v>
<v Speaker 4>families that they can't get away from </v>

1585
01:30:38.041 --> 01:30:40.950
<v Speaker 4>them and that's the typical situation </v>
<v Speaker 4>that Freud described.</v>

1586
01:30:40.951 --> 01:30:42.130
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

1587
01:30:42.131 --> 01:30:45.960
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so brilliantly and young also elaborated</v>

1588
01:30:45.961 --> 01:30:46.794
<v Speaker 4>on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of that's a consequence of hyper </v>

1589
01:30:48.781 --> 01:30:50.100
<v Speaker 4>dependence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1590
01:30:50.101 --> 01:30:53.610
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the danger of over protection.</v>

1591
01:30:54.420 --> 01:30:57.180
<v Speaker 4>Now there's a rule if you're dealing </v>
<v Speaker 4>with elderly people,</v>

1592
01:30:57.181 --> 01:31:00.180
<v Speaker 4>say in an elder care institution,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the rule is something like,</v>

1593
01:31:00.181 --> 01:31:03.360
<v Speaker 4>don't do anything for your charges that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they can do themselves.</v>

1594
01:31:03.870 --> 01:31:05.510
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of a harsh rule,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1595
01:31:05.511 --> 01:31:07.320
<v Speaker 4>if you see someone struggling with their</v>
<v Speaker 4>buttons,</v>

1596
01:31:07.590 --> 01:31:10.350
<v Speaker 4>maybe they're three years old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to rush over and help.</v>

1597
01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:11.393
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1598
01:31:11.970 --> 01:31:16.410
<v Speaker 4>maybe you don't because they need to </v>
<v Speaker 4>learn how to do up there damn buttons or</v>

1599
01:31:16.411 --> 01:31:20.250
<v Speaker 4>if there are 85,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they need to maintain their independence</v>

1600
01:31:20.251 --> 01:31:22.590
<v Speaker 4>as much as possible without your </v>
<v Speaker 4>compassion.</v>

1601
01:31:22.591 --> 01:31:24.180
<v Speaker 4>Stealing it from them.</v>

1602
01:31:25.410 --> 01:31:26.243
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well we could hypothesize that there </v>

1603
01:31:28.171 --> 01:31:29.004
<v Speaker 4>would be no pathobiology as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>consequence of the female rise to </v>

1604
01:31:31.951 --> 01:31:32.784
<v Speaker 4>political power,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but given that females are human beings </v>

1605
01:31:35.551 --> 01:31:36.384
<v Speaker 4>too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we're pretty much rife with </v>

1606
01:31:37.140 --> 01:31:37.973
<v Speaker 4>pathology,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the probability that there'll be a </v>

1607
01:31:39.601 --> 01:31:40.434
<v Speaker 4>downside is like there is two male </v>
<v Speaker 4>participation which would be more </v>

1608
01:31:44.461 --> 01:31:46.350
<v Speaker 4>aggressive and hyper and hyper </v>
<v Speaker 4>competent,</v>

1609
01:31:46.351 --> 01:31:47.184
<v Speaker 4>aggressiveness and hypercompetition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The probability that there would be a </v>

1610
01:31:49.621 --> 01:31:50.454
<v Speaker 4>downside is extraordinarily high.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well why wouldn't it be a downside </v>

1611
01:31:53.281 --> 01:31:54.114
<v Speaker 4>associated with hyper protectiveness?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's exactly what you'd expect and then </v>

1612
01:31:57.541 --> 01:31:58.374
<v Speaker 4>what you see playing out in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>political as far as I'm as far as I can </v>

1613
01:32:01.481 --> 01:32:03.160
<v Speaker 4>tell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and maybe I'm wrong,</v>

1614
01:32:03.370 --> 01:32:06.760
<v Speaker 4>is wherever there's a negative quality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's an oppressor,</v>

1615
01:32:06.940 --> 01:32:07.773
<v Speaker 4>oppression narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so anyone who's stacks up at the </v>

1616
01:32:11.021 --> 01:32:11.854
<v Speaker 4>bottom of a hierarchy is a victim slash </v>
<v Speaker 4>infant and anyone at the top is an </v>

1617
01:32:16.121 --> 01:32:21.121
<v Speaker 4>oppressor slash predator and I think </v>
<v Speaker 4>confusing the hierarchical structure,</v>

1618
01:32:22.030 --> 01:32:22.863
<v Speaker 4>especially when it's based on competence</v>
<v Speaker 4>and western structures of hierarchy are </v>

1619
01:32:27.221 --> 01:32:30.760
<v Speaker 4>based in large part,</v>
<v Speaker 4>although not entirely on competence.</v>

1620
01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:31.833
<v Speaker 4>Confusing that with a Predator infant or</v>
<v Speaker 4>oppressor oppression relationship is a </v>

1621
01:32:37.451 --> 01:32:40.180
<v Speaker 4>very bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

1622
01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:44.980
<v Speaker 4>having said that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's obvious that every social structure</v>

1623
01:32:44.981 --> 01:32:48.160
<v Speaker 4>has a tyrannical element,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like nobody in their right mind is going</v>

1624
01:32:48.161 --> 01:32:49.300
<v Speaker 4>to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1625
01:32:49.480 --> 01:32:50.313
<v Speaker 4>our cultural structures are a hundred </v>
<v Speaker 4>percent fair and just obviously they're </v>

1626
01:32:55.001 --> 01:32:55.834
<v Speaker 4>not in every single person in this room </v>
<v Speaker 4>and some far more than others have been </v>

1627
01:32:59.651 --> 01:33:04.060
<v Speaker 4>brutalized by the social structure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which takes you around the neck,</v>

1628
01:33:04.210 --> 01:33:08.830
<v Speaker 4>shakes the hell out of you and says you </v>
<v Speaker 4>better be like everyone else or else.</v>

1629
01:33:09.070 --> 01:33:09.903
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the tyrannical aspect of the </v>

1630
01:33:10.931 --> 01:33:11.764
<v Speaker 4>social structure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you have to be naive not to think </v>

1631
01:33:13.991 --> 01:33:17.110
<v Speaker 4>that there's some old pressure </v>
<v Speaker 4>oppressor,</v>

1632
01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:19.840
<v Speaker 4>oppression dynamic in a social </v>
<v Speaker 4>structure,</v>

1633
01:33:20.080 --> 01:33:20.913
<v Speaker 4>but to make that the only,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the only element of the discussion is </v>

1634
01:33:24.371 --> 01:33:25.870
<v Speaker 4>extraordinarily dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1635
01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:27.393
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that looking at </v>
<v Speaker 4>terrible things has done for me is make </v>

1636
01:33:31.211 --> 01:33:32.950
<v Speaker 4>me a very grateful person.</v>

1637
01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:34.473
<v Speaker 4>Like when I walk out on the street and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>see that people aren't at each other's </v>

1638
01:33:37.511 --> 01:33:40.240
<v Speaker 4>throats.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really think that that's a miracle.</v>

1639
01:33:40.241 --> 01:33:42.910
<v Speaker 4>Like I was just in Manhattan for a week.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1640
01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:46.330
<v Speaker 4>if your eyes are open,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that place is an absolute miracle.</v>

1641
01:33:46.450 --> 01:33:48.240
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's way too many people there.</v>

1642
01:33:48.730 --> 01:33:50.770
<v Speaker 4>7 million people come in to date,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1643
01:33:50.850 --> 01:33:51.683
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1644
01:33:51.700 --> 01:33:52.533
<v Speaker 4>there's way too many people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're just stacked on top of each </v>

1645
01:33:54.881 --> 01:33:55.714
<v Speaker 4>other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These all these massive skyscrapers and </v>

1646
01:33:57.281 --> 01:33:59.000
<v Speaker 4>they all stand up there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They all,</v>

1647
01:33:59.001 --> 01:34:01.690
<v Speaker 4>all standing up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the traffic lights work,</v>

1648
01:34:01.750 --> 01:34:02.583
<v Speaker 4>all the electricity works.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The buildings aren't blowing up one </v>

1649
01:34:04.781 --> 01:34:06.790
<v Speaker 4>after another because of natural gas </v>
<v Speaker 4>leaks.</v>

1650
01:34:06.970 --> 01:34:07.803
<v Speaker 4>They just don't blow up and people </v>
<v Speaker 4>aren't like beating each other to death </v>

1651
01:34:10.931 --> 01:34:12.890
<v Speaker 4>with clubs in the street.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1652
01:34:12.940 --> 01:34:14.980
<v Speaker 4>so when I go outside in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

1653
01:34:15.190 --> 01:34:17.260
<v Speaker 4>my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how did we manage this?</v>

1654
01:34:17.500 --> 01:34:19.230
<v Speaker 4>Because I'm a hub.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

1655
01:34:19.231 --> 01:34:20.800
<v Speaker 4>and by nature,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1656
01:34:21.070 --> 01:34:21.903
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's not like I'm entirely </v>

1657
01:34:24.311 --> 01:34:25.144
<v Speaker 4>pessimistic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think that you're naive if you </v>

1658
01:34:28.391 --> 01:34:31.900
<v Speaker 4>don't think that the natural state of </v>
<v Speaker 4>human beings is one of brutality,</v>

1659
01:34:32.290 --> 01:34:33.123
<v Speaker 4>all you have to do is look at history </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you'll be convinced of that very </v>

1660
01:34:35.201 --> 01:34:36.850
<v Speaker 4>rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the fact that,</v>

1661
01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:38.620
<v Speaker 4>look at us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can all sit in here.</v>

1662
01:34:38.890 --> 01:34:39.723
<v Speaker 4>We don't know who.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't know each other and we're </v>

1663
01:34:41.561 --> 01:34:42.394
<v Speaker 4>having a contentious political </v>
<v Speaker 4>discussion and like nothing terrible is </v>

1664
01:34:45.851 --> 01:34:48.370
<v Speaker 4>happening and if you don't see that as a</v>
<v Speaker 4>miracle,</v>

1665
01:34:48.670 --> 01:34:51.940
<v Speaker 4>then you're way to protect for your own </v>
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>

1666
01:34:52.810 --> 01:34:53.643
<v Speaker 4>So well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So back to the back to the </v>

1667
01:34:56.561 --> 01:35:01.220
<v Speaker 4>agreeableness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are tyrannies of care.</v>

1668
01:35:02.730 --> 01:35:05.220
<v Speaker 4>The psychoanalysts said the good mother </v>
<v Speaker 4>fails.</v>

1669
01:35:06.850 --> 01:35:09.700
<v Speaker 4>And what that means is that when your </v>
<v Speaker 4>kid is three years old,</v>

1670
01:35:09.701 --> 01:35:12.430
<v Speaker 4>two years old and stumbling around </v>
<v Speaker 4>making mistakes,</v>

1671
01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:13.353
<v Speaker 4>you back the hell off and you let them </v>
<v Speaker 4>make mistakes and you don't view the </v>

1672
01:35:17.621 --> 01:35:18.454
<v Speaker 4>world as the infant in Predator and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't project that onto the political </v>

1673
01:35:20.891 --> 01:35:25.320
<v Speaker 4>system because it's not a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Especially if those who,</v>

1674
01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:29.200
<v Speaker 4>especially for those who you </v>
<v Speaker 4>misdiagnosis as predators.</v>

1675
01:35:29.530 --> 01:35:30.363
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so now we're going to open it up for q </v>

1676
01:35:31.961 --> 01:35:33.180
<v Speaker 6>and a.</v>
<v Speaker 6>all right?</v>

1677
01:35:33.220 --> 01:35:33.820
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so the,</v>

1678
01:35:33.820 --> 01:35:37.030
<v Speaker 6>the idea that I've put thought into this</v>
<v Speaker 6>as perhaps a optimistic one,</v>

1679
01:35:37.270 --> 01:35:38.103
<v Speaker 6>but as you might imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you've been a topic of conversation on </v>

1680
01:35:40.781 --> 01:35:42.670
<v Speaker 6>this campus a lot in the past week or </v>
<v Speaker 6>so.</v>

1681
01:35:42.850 --> 01:35:44.770
<v Speaker 6>Certainly among a lot of us who discuss </v>
<v Speaker 6>politics.</v>

1682
01:35:44.771 --> 01:35:45.604
<v Speaker 6>And one of the things that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 6>united people who liked and disliked a </v>

1683
01:35:48.251 --> 01:35:49.084
<v Speaker 6>lot of your ideas is that we appreciate </v>
<v Speaker 6>your defensive free speech and we </v>

1684
01:35:51.131 --> 01:35:52.960
<v Speaker 6>appreciate you coming here to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 6>it with us.</v>

1685
01:35:53.300 --> 01:35:54.133
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but one of the things I thought was </v>

1686
01:35:54.521 --> 01:35:55.354
<v Speaker 6>really interesting is professor van </v>
<v Speaker 6>Vandyke addressed the distinction </v>

1687
01:35:57.161 --> 01:35:57.994
<v Speaker 6>between you and Jonathan Heit and you </v>
<v Speaker 6>mentioned this as sort of a </v>

1688
01:36:00.221 --> 01:36:01.870
<v Speaker 6>temperamental one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I think,</v>

1689
01:36:01.990 --> 01:36:03.640
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure that's true to some extent,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I,</v>

1690
01:36:03.641 --> 01:36:07.780
<v Speaker 6>I noticed you've made a lot of more sort</v>
<v Speaker 6>of substantively inflammatory claims.</v>

1691
01:36:07.780 --> 01:36:08.613
<v Speaker 6>Like in the course of this lecture you </v>
<v Speaker 6>called the peep the authors of facebook </v>

1692
01:36:11.681 --> 01:36:14.500
<v Speaker 6>posts demons into totality Tarion's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1693
01:36:14.501 --> 01:36:15.334
<v Speaker 6>in past events you've called them things</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a neo Marxist Cultural Marxists </v>

1694
01:36:19.570 --> 01:36:20.230
<v Speaker 6>you've called them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

1695
01:36:20.230 --> 01:36:23.380
<v Speaker 6>I believe a fifth column that is </v>
<v Speaker 6>committing treason against the west.</v>

1696
01:36:23.830 --> 01:36:25.510
<v Speaker 6>And it seems to me this is more than </v>
<v Speaker 6>temperamental.</v>

1697
01:36:25.511 --> 01:36:28.530
<v Speaker 6>This is a substantive difference and </v>
<v Speaker 6>difference.</v>

1698
01:36:28.740 --> 01:36:31.000
<v Speaker 6>And another thing you've done is that </v>
<v Speaker 6>unlike height,</v>

1699
01:36:31.001 --> 01:36:34.150
<v Speaker 6>you have a more sort of comprehensive </v>
<v Speaker 6>political program.</v>

1700
01:36:34.360 --> 01:36:36.820
<v Speaker 6>You've talked a lot in defensive,</v>
<v Speaker 6>traditional hierarchies,</v>

1701
01:36:36.821 --> 01:36:41.140
<v Speaker 6>both gender of class.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So on the lymphatically not race,</v>

1702
01:36:41.500 --> 01:36:43.980
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and so I haven't talked about defensive,</v>

1703
01:36:43.990 --> 01:36:46.030
<v Speaker 6>traditional hierarchies in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 6>gender and class.</v>

1704
01:36:46.031 --> 01:36:47.320
<v Speaker 6>That's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1705
01:36:47.321 --> 01:36:49.840
<v Speaker 6>you've talked about hierarchies in </v>
<v Speaker 6>society.</v>

1706
01:36:49.841 --> 01:36:51.250
<v Speaker 6>You've talked about that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's true.</v>

1707
01:36:51.430 --> 01:36:54.610
<v Speaker 6>I haven't done.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I haven't justified them on the basis of</v>

1708
01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:56.180
<v Speaker 6>gender and class.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You,</v>

1709
01:36:56.270 --> 01:36:59.050
<v Speaker 6>you whatever talked not okay.</v>

1710
01:36:59.140 --> 01:37:02.920
<v Speaker 6>That's an important distinction.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But you defend hierarchies in society in</v>

1711
01:37:02.921 --> 01:37:06.640
<v Speaker 6>a way that you talk a lot about the </v>
<v Speaker 6>predo distribution.</v>

1712
01:37:06.641 --> 01:37:08.590
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That doesn't mean I defend it.</v>

1713
01:37:08.650 --> 01:37:09.101
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>

1714
01:37:09.101 --> 01:37:10.330
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not well.</v>

1715
01:37:10.331 --> 01:37:11.620
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

1716
01:37:13.420 --> 01:37:14.253
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean I think you talked about loving </v>

1717
01:37:16.270 --> 01:37:19.120
<v Speaker 6>that something exists is not the same as</v>
<v Speaker 6>defending it.</v>

1718
01:37:19.300 --> 01:37:21.480
<v Speaker 6>How in the world people attack it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

1719
01:37:21.481 --> 01:37:22.314
<v Speaker 6>So you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>People attack it apparently attack the </v>

1720
01:37:24.821 --> 01:37:26.950
<v Speaker 6>hierarchies of society's inherently </v>
<v Speaker 6>unjust.</v>

1721
01:37:27.040 --> 01:37:28.120
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1722
01:37:28.121 --> 01:37:29.410
<v Speaker 6>they are,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're unjust.</v>

1723
01:37:29.660 --> 01:37:31.210
<v Speaker 6>They're also useful.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1724
01:37:31.211 --> 01:37:35.740
<v Speaker 6>So you said they're useful some level.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We'll just look at it this way.</v>

1725
01:37:36.460 --> 01:37:40.990
<v Speaker 6>You obviously think that it's worthwhile</v>
<v Speaker 6>to stand up and ask a question.</v>

1726
01:37:41.020 --> 01:37:43.720
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you think that standing up and asking</v>

1727
01:37:43.721 --> 01:37:47.290
<v Speaker 6>a question is better than not standing </v>
<v Speaker 6>up and asking your question?</v>

1728
01:37:47.320 --> 01:37:47.861
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1729
01:37:47.861 --> 01:37:50.680
<v Speaker 6>That's a hierarchy of values.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

1730
01:37:50.710 --> 01:37:52.480
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Without the hierarchy of values,</v>

1731
01:37:52.481 --> 01:37:54.190
<v Speaker 6>you couldn't act,</v>
<v Speaker 6>of course.</v>

1732
01:37:54.390 --> 01:37:54.760
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

1733
01:37:54.760 --> 01:37:55.593
<v Speaker 6>not course.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's partly why I'm defending the </v>

1734
01:37:57.661 --> 01:38:01.200
<v Speaker 6>hierarchy hierarchy hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1735
01:38:01.410 --> 01:38:02.243
<v Speaker 6>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>There is a hierarchy in society right </v>

1736
01:38:03.540 --> 01:38:04.500
<v Speaker 6>now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's multiple.</v>

1737
01:38:04.780 --> 01:38:06.480
<v Speaker 6>There are multiple hierarchies in </v>
<v Speaker 6>society.</v>

1738
01:38:06.540 --> 01:38:08.860
<v Speaker 6>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and you say that they are based in you.</v>

1739
01:38:08.870 --> 01:38:10.080
<v Speaker 6>You invoke the lobster,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right,</v>

1740
01:38:10.081 --> 01:38:14.300
<v Speaker 6>that they are based in in nature.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I said that they were inevitable,</v>

1741
01:38:14.430 --> 01:38:17.450
<v Speaker 6>that they were inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Some people are good,</v>

1742
01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:18.353
<v Speaker 6>but my point is that this is Jenna.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you have a broader point then free </v>

1743
01:38:22.231 --> 01:38:23.064
<v Speaker 6>speech.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is one of the things you talk </v>

1744
01:38:24.211 --> 01:38:25.044
<v Speaker 6>about.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>

1745
01:38:25.740 --> 01:38:26.573
<v Speaker 6>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1746
01:38:26.790 --> 01:38:29.550
<v Speaker 6>Whereas I think there's some other </v>
<v Speaker 6>activist who focus on more exclusive,</v>

1747
01:38:29.551 --> 01:38:30.384
<v Speaker 6>not an activist.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's some other individuals who </v>

1748
01:38:32.431 --> 01:38:35.820
<v Speaker 6>engage in public political speech.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1749
01:38:35.950 --> 01:38:36.783
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Who.</v>

1750
01:38:36.790 --> 01:38:38.730
<v Speaker 6>Who focus more exclusively on free </v>
<v Speaker 6>speech.</v>

1751
01:38:38.731 --> 01:38:39.564
<v Speaker 6>Whereas you have other goals in mind,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but one of the things that you're more </v>

1752
01:38:42.750 --> 01:38:46.050
<v Speaker 6>inflammatory language and it's fair,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a subsidy of disagreement,</v>

1753
01:38:46.230 --> 01:38:48.300
<v Speaker 6>has done,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think is it's politicized.</v>

1754
01:38:48.300 --> 01:38:50.640
<v Speaker 6>This free speaks to an extent that </v>
<v Speaker 6>someone like height hasn't.</v>

1755
01:38:50.910 --> 01:38:51.743
<v Speaker 6>I've noticed that when someone hears the</v>
<v Speaker 6>term free speech now they associate it </v>

1756
01:38:54.751 --> 01:38:57.810
<v Speaker 6>with a specific set of thinkers often is</v>
<v Speaker 6>viewed as on the extreme,</v>

1757
01:38:57.811 --> 01:38:59.250
<v Speaker 6>right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I think,</v>

1758
01:38:59.670 --> 01:39:00.503
<v Speaker 6>I think arguably that's the problem of </v>
<v Speaker 6>all factions in society because free </v>

1759
01:39:02.491 --> 01:39:03.324
<v Speaker 6>speech should be a universal value.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Polls certainly suggests that it's </v>

1760
01:39:05.850 --> 01:39:08.070
<v Speaker 6>coming under increasing threat from both</v>
<v Speaker 6>sides,</v>

1761
01:39:08.310 --> 01:39:09.143
<v Speaker 6>but I suppose the heart of my question </v>
<v Speaker 6>in addition to of course these other </v>

1762
01:39:11.460 --> 01:39:12.293
<v Speaker 6>observations is that do you believe free</v>
<v Speaker 6>speech is your primary end or do you </v>

1763
01:39:16.771 --> 01:39:17.604
<v Speaker 6>believe these other points you're making</v>
<v Speaker 6>are important because I've heard you a </v>

1764
01:39:19.201 --> 01:39:20.034
<v Speaker 6>bunch of times defend free speech sort </v>
<v Speaker 6>of contextually like you've complained </v>

1765
01:39:22.951 --> 01:39:25.140
<v Speaker 6>about some of the laws in Canada that </v>
<v Speaker 6>you dislike,</v>

1766
01:39:25.350 --> 01:39:28.050
<v Speaker 6>that they institutionalized false facts </v>
<v Speaker 6>into the law,</v>

1767
01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:29.153
<v Speaker 6>but it seems to me that in absolute is </v>
<v Speaker 6>defensive free speech makes no </v>

1768
01:39:31.771 --> 01:39:33.000
<v Speaker 6>preferences to true or false.</v>

1769
01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:36.360
<v Speaker 6>The point is that something you are </v>
<v Speaker 6>being forced to say something.</v>

1770
01:39:36.361 --> 01:39:38.790
<v Speaker 6>It wouldn't be as bad as if you were </v>
<v Speaker 6>forced to say something.</v>

1771
01:39:38.791 --> 01:39:39.624
<v Speaker 6>That is true because the point of free </v>
<v Speaker 6>speech is that you can say whatever you </v>

1772
01:39:42.241 --> 01:39:43.074
<v Speaker 6>want,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1773
01:39:43.110 --> 01:39:43.943
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the point of free speech is so that you </v>

1774
01:39:45.061 --> 01:39:45.894
<v Speaker 6>can think your way through life without </v>
<v Speaker 6>running toll position a versus perfect </v>

1775
01:39:51.030 --> 01:39:53.180
<v Speaker 6>position b is just as bad.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

1776
01:39:53.190 --> 01:39:54.720
<v Speaker 6>Even if one is true and the other is </v>
<v Speaker 6>not.</v>

1777
01:39:56.010 --> 01:39:57.600
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well there was a bunch of questions.</v>

1778
01:39:57.660 --> 01:39:59.130
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>good job by the way.</v>

1779
01:39:59.490 --> 01:40:02.430
<v Speaker 6>We'll actually wait.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Can I just ask one additional agenda</v>

1780
01:40:04.260 --> 01:40:05.093
<v Speaker 6>which is</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think the politicization of free </v>

1781
01:40:08.971 --> 01:40:12.810
<v Speaker 6>speech is by far the biggest threat to </v>
<v Speaker 6>free speech because this has always been</v>

1782
01:40:12.811 --> 01:40:14.340
<v Speaker 6>a radical.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Leftists are the biggest</v>

1783
01:40:15.930 --> 01:40:16.763
<v Speaker 6>disagreement.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Professor Greely alluded to in previous </v>

1784
01:40:20.191 --> 01:40:21.540
<v Speaker 6>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The subsidies,</v>

1785
01:40:21.570 --> 01:40:24.000
<v Speaker 6>threats to free speech in much of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>world in Europe.</v>

1786
01:40:24.060 --> 01:40:24.893
<v Speaker 6>Certainly I think in the United States </v>
<v Speaker 6>as well from the government have come </v>

1787
01:40:27.211 --> 01:40:28.044
<v Speaker 6>from the radical right and I think it's </v>
<v Speaker 6>fair to say that on the specific narrow </v>

1788
01:40:31.291 --> 01:40:33.720
<v Speaker 6>subset of certain departments on liberal</v>
<v Speaker 6>arts colleges,</v>

1789
01:40:33.721 --> 01:40:37.200
<v Speaker 6>it's fair to say threat comes from the </v>
<v Speaker 6>left though its scope is in dispute,</v>

1790
01:40:37.230 --> 01:40:41.550
<v Speaker 6>but my question is you think that the </v>
<v Speaker 6>way you talk about free speech,</v>

1791
01:40:41.580 --> 01:40:42.413
<v Speaker 6>the way you link it to specific issues,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the way you use inflammatory language </v>

1792
01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:45.953
<v Speaker 6>and the way you seem to make it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you seem to defend a specific set of </v>

1793
01:40:48.391 --> 01:40:50.460
<v Speaker 6>free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's certainly plenty of instances of</v>

1794
01:40:50.461 --> 01:40:52.920
<v Speaker 6>free speech attacked on the other side </v>
<v Speaker 6>that you don't mention as.</v>

1795
01:40:53.580 --> 01:40:54.413
<v Speaker 6>Do you think you risked politicizing </v>
<v Speaker 6>this because it seems to me that was </v>

1796
01:40:56.710 --> 01:40:59.860
<v Speaker 6>okay and not think that's a far greater </v>
<v Speaker 6>threat because for example,</v>

1797
01:40:59.890 --> 01:41:02.870
<v Speaker 6>the NRA,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the NRA is a group in the United States,</v>

1798
01:41:02.910 --> 01:41:04.110
<v Speaker 6>the defense guns rights.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

1799
01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:05.160
<v Speaker 6>Hold it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

1800
01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:07.300
<v Speaker 3>We need a question.</v>

1801
01:41:07.390 --> 01:41:08.223
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1802
01:41:08.520 --> 01:41:09.940
<v Speaker 6>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're doing fine.</v>

1803
01:41:10.270 --> 01:41:12.040
<v Speaker 6>It's just too much.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like I can't keep.</v>

1804
01:41:12.120 --> 01:41:12.953
<v Speaker 6>I think that your behavior risk </v>
<v Speaker 6>politicizing it and do you think that </v>

1805
01:41:16.781 --> 01:41:18.070
<v Speaker 6>polarization is justified?</v>

1806
01:41:18.500 --> 01:41:18.980
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1807
01:41:18.980 --> 01:41:21.440
<v Speaker 3>I think my behavior risks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>politicizing it,</v>

1808
01:41:21.470 --> 01:41:25.430
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would rather it not be politicized and</v>

1809
01:41:25.670 --> 01:41:26.503
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing what I can to manage that risk</v>
<v Speaker 3>however it's become political in my </v>

1810
01:41:30.381 --> 01:41:31.214
<v Speaker 3>country because the government </v>
<v Speaker 3>implemented compelled speech </v>

1811
01:41:34.131 --> 01:41:34.964
<v Speaker 3>legislation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I wasn't complaining about that </v>

1812
01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:42.680
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It became political now and there are,</v>

1813
01:41:42.800 --> 01:41:43.633
<v Speaker 3>there is a time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even when you're detached in some sense </v>

1814
01:41:47.031 --> 01:41:50.060
<v Speaker 3>from the political realm that you can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>be detached anymore.</v>

1815
01:41:50.750 --> 01:41:51.583
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not happy with the fact that this </v>

1816
01:41:53.181 --> 01:41:54.014
<v Speaker 3>has become politicized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could say that I haven't done a </v>

1817
01:41:56.871 --> 01:41:57.704
<v Speaker 3>stellar job in ensuring in every </v>
<v Speaker 3>possible manner that this is remained </v>

1818
01:42:01.101 --> 01:42:04.040
<v Speaker 3>neutrally a political,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably true,</v>

1819
01:42:04.750 --> 01:42:05.583
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not particularly unhappy with </v>

1820
01:42:08.811 --> 01:42:11.180
<v Speaker 3>the way things have gone so far.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1821
01:42:11.181 --> 01:42:12.014
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not happy with the radical left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so if they're irritated at me so </v>

1822
01:42:16.251 --> 01:42:18.200
<v Speaker 3>much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the better as far as I'm concerned.</v>

1823
01:42:18.920 --> 01:42:23.920
<v Speaker 3>So have I conducted myself perfectly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a undoubtedly know.</v>

1824
01:42:25.670 --> 01:42:27.050
<v Speaker 3>So I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1825
01:42:27.110 --> 01:42:31.880
<v Speaker 3>I've got more than my fair share of </v>
<v Speaker 3>faults and a temper is one of them.</v>

1826
01:42:32.540 --> 01:42:33.373
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1827
01:42:35.510 --> 01:42:36.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm muddling through.</v>

1828
01:42:37.920 --> 01:42:38.753
<v Speaker 2>Hm,</v>

1829
01:42:40.700 --> 01:42:41.533
<v Speaker 7>alright.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm almost hesitant to ask you a </v>

1830
01:42:42.591 --> 01:42:43.490
<v Speaker 7>question now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

1831
01:42:43.640 --> 01:42:44.473
<v Speaker 7>but,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

1832
01:42:44.990 --> 01:42:46.740
<v Speaker 7>so,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1833
01:42:47.690 --> 01:42:48.523
<v Speaker 7>one thing I was wondering about was a </v>
<v Speaker 7>lot of people I think would argue that </v>

1834
01:42:51.320 --> 01:42:54.680
<v Speaker 7>I'm kind of the values of Western </v>
<v Speaker 7>civilization,</v>

1835
01:42:55.070 --> 01:42:56.270
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>free speech,</v>

1836
01:42:56.271 --> 01:42:57.104
<v Speaker 7>the right of the individual,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a separation between church and state </v>

1837
01:43:00.270 --> 01:43:01.103
<v Speaker 7>have developed through not so much a in </v>
<v Speaker 7>continuous with the Judeo Christian </v>

1838
01:43:07.281 --> 01:43:08.114
<v Speaker 7>morality,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but almost in their overthrow through </v>

1839
01:43:09.831 --> 01:43:10.664
<v Speaker 7>such things as the enlightenment,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the scientific revolution and how these </v>

1840
01:43:14.721 --> 01:43:16.190
<v Speaker 7>values,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1841
01:43:16.280 --> 01:43:18.230
<v Speaker 7>would never have come out of just </v>
<v Speaker 7>simply,</v>

1842
01:43:18.910 --> 01:43:19.743
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

1843
01:43:19.820 --> 01:43:23.990
<v Speaker 7>the continuous of the Middle Ages and </v>
<v Speaker 7>that you did Christian morality.</v>

1844
01:43:24.260 --> 01:43:29.260
<v Speaker 7>But my understanding of your view would </v>
<v Speaker 7>be that those values are inherent in the</v>

1845
01:43:30.351 --> 01:43:33.950
<v Speaker 7>Judeo Christian morality.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I'm just wondering how you think,</v>

1846
01:43:34.020 --> 01:43:35.600
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

1847
01:43:35.630 --> 01:43:38.460
<v Speaker 7>just what is the value of Jacobs from </v>
<v Speaker 7>around in my own world?</v>

1848
01:43:38.750 --> 01:43:40.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a great question.</v>

1849
01:43:40.750 --> 01:43:45.750
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not rational values.</v>

1850
01:43:50.040 --> 01:43:51.960
<v Speaker 3>There are deeper than values.</v>

1851
01:43:52.180 --> 01:43:53.013
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a surprise to me going back into </v>

1852
01:43:55.641 --> 01:43:56.540
<v Speaker 4>the past,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>

1853
01:43:56.541 --> 01:44:01.430
<v Speaker 4>to see how deep these values were.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I would say that</v>

1854
01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:06.800
<v Speaker 4>not only are they part of the Judeo </v>
<v Speaker 4>Christian story,</v>

1855
01:44:06.801 --> 01:44:07.634
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that they're grounded in phenomena </v>

1856
01:44:10.581 --> 01:44:11.414
<v Speaker 4>that are even deeper than that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now there's been a fair bit of </v>

1857
01:44:13.371 --> 01:44:17.100
<v Speaker 4>investigation into the emergence of </v>
<v Speaker 4>fairplay,</v>

1858
01:44:17.150 --> 01:44:21.230
<v Speaker 4>let's say among animals rats or </v>
<v Speaker 4>primates,</v>

1859
01:44:21.260 --> 01:44:22.093
<v Speaker 4>wolves and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's an ethos that emerges </v>

1860
01:44:25.250 --> 01:44:26.083
<v Speaker 4>behaviorally and is then perhaps woven </v>
<v Speaker 4>into narrative and then codify that </v>

1861
01:44:29.661 --> 01:44:34.280
<v Speaker 4>seems to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>isomorphic across these different levels</v>

1862
01:44:34.730 --> 01:44:35.563
<v Speaker 4>and I think it's been well articulated </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the narrative sense in the Judeo </v>

1863
01:44:40.070 --> 01:44:41.960
<v Speaker 4>Christian Corpus of stories and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's out of that,</v>

1864
01:44:41.961 --> 01:44:46.220
<v Speaker 4>that our legal systems and institutions </v>
<v Speaker 4>of rights have emerged.</v>

1865
01:44:46.760 --> 01:44:47.593
<v Speaker 4>People make the case that that was </v>
<v Speaker 4>fundamentally and enlightenment issue </v>

1866
01:44:50.091 --> 01:44:50.924
<v Speaker 4>and it was certainly the case that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>rational clarity that came along with </v>

1867
01:44:55.551 --> 01:44:56.384
<v Speaker 4>the enlightenment increased the degree </v>
<v Speaker 4>to which that was articulated and </v>

1868
01:44:59.511 --> 01:45:00.770
<v Speaker 4>transformed into law.</v>

1869
01:45:01.040 --> 01:45:04.940
<v Speaker 4>But I think to attribute it to that is a</v>
<v Speaker 4>great mistake.</v>

1870
01:45:05.270 --> 01:45:06.103
<v Speaker 4>I think it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the timespan view is way too </v>

1871
01:45:10.011 --> 01:45:12.230
<v Speaker 4>narrow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's 500 years ago.</v>

1872
01:45:12.580 --> 01:45:16.400
<v Speaker 4>I'm a biologically minded guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like 500 years.</v>

1873
01:45:16.401 --> 01:45:19.610
<v Speaker 4>That's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Five thousand years.</v>

1874
01:45:20.360 --> 01:45:21.193
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's starting to register 50,000 </v>

1875
01:45:22.821 --> 01:45:23.654
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's worthy of note 6 million years now </v>

1876
01:45:27.171 --> 01:45:28.004
<v Speaker 4>you're getting somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's the ethic that we're discussing </v>

1877
01:45:30.681 --> 01:45:35.681
<v Speaker 4>is way deeper than something conjured up</v>
<v Speaker 4>in like 1500 by some northern Italians.</v>

1878
01:45:38.660 --> 01:45:43.640
<v Speaker 4>So it's an articulation of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>substructure that's much deeper than the</v>

1879
01:45:43.641 --> 01:45:46.640
<v Speaker 4>articulation itself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what it looks like to me now.</v>

1880
01:45:46.641 --> 01:45:49.640
<v Speaker 4>I think there's room for intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 4>debate about that,</v>

1881
01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:55.240
<v Speaker 4>but I've looked at the enlightenment </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinkers and at the deeper at,</v>

1882
01:45:55.670 --> 01:45:59.240
<v Speaker 4>at people who I regard as deeper and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think the deeper guys,</v>

1883
01:45:59.241 --> 01:46:00.074
<v Speaker 4>Nietzsche,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dostoevsky young in particular social </v>

1884
01:46:02.100 --> 01:46:04.430
<v Speaker 4>units to some degree they've got it </v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1885
01:46:05.510 --> 01:46:06.343
<v Speaker 4>So I don't think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that our rights are an </v>

1886
01:46:08.721 --> 01:46:09.554
<v Speaker 4>enlightenment project there </v>
<v Speaker 4>instantiation into codified law that's </v>

1887
01:46:14.271 --> 01:46:16.940
<v Speaker 4>more part and parcel of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>enlightenment that,</v>

1888
01:46:16.941 --> 01:46:20.030
<v Speaker 4>that would be particularly manifest in a</v>
<v Speaker 4>place like the United States,</v>

1889
01:46:20.730 --> 01:46:21.890
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

1890
01:46:23.340 --> 01:46:25.350
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If I can just ask a related question is,</v>

1891
01:46:25.351 --> 01:46:29.160
<v Speaker 7>you mentioned each a and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>because from what I understand,</v>

1892
01:46:29.161 --> 01:46:30.750
<v Speaker 7>if you're working,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you just seem to draw from him a lot.</v>

1893
01:46:30.751 --> 01:46:32.130
<v Speaker 7>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you said you agree with him.</v>

1894
01:46:32.490 --> 01:46:33.310
<v Speaker 7>So I just,</v>

1895
01:46:33.310 --> 01:46:35.680
<v Speaker 4>you know what he thinks a lot of things.</v>

1896
01:46:35.810 --> 01:46:36.643
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So I guess I'm wondering where you </v>

1897
01:46:39.051 --> 01:46:39.884
<v Speaker 7>think,</v>
<v Speaker 7>because I'm imagining you imagine he </v>

1898
01:46:41.421 --> 01:46:42.254
<v Speaker 7>went wrong in his interpretation of the </v>
<v Speaker 7>Christian morality and how he believes </v>

1899
01:46:47.790 --> 01:46:50.610
<v Speaker 7>and how he believes that's kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 7>pernicious</v>

1900
01:46:50.760 --> 01:46:52.350
<v Speaker 4>soy based morality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what do you,</v>

1901
01:46:52.410 --> 01:46:53.243
<v Speaker 4>what exactly do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because you agree with a lot of other </v>

1902
01:46:55.830 --> 01:46:57.660
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Christian morality,</v>

1903
01:46:57.661 --> 01:46:58.494
<v Speaker 4>he created critique Christian Dogma and </v>
<v Speaker 4>and structures that's not exactly the </v>

1904
01:47:02.611 --> 01:47:05.070
<v Speaker 4>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you would agree with him then?</v>

1905
01:47:05.320 --> 01:47:05.881
<v Speaker 4>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1906
01:47:05.881 --> 01:47:07.770
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a complicated guy,</v>

1907
01:47:08.160 --> 01:47:13.160
<v Speaker 4>but I think the slave morality idea,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea that the oppressed or somehow a</v>

1908
01:47:14.310 --> 01:47:15.143
<v Speaker 4>virtuous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I don't think is a central </v>

1909
01:47:17.551 --> 01:47:18.384
<v Speaker 4>Christian idea by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was something that he criticized as </v>

1910
01:47:21.180 --> 01:47:23.920
<v Speaker 4>part and parcel of what was constructed </v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1911
01:47:23.980 --> 01:47:25.880
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and concretized in,</v>

1912
01:47:26.160 --> 01:47:28.890
<v Speaker 4>in an institutional Christianity and </v>
<v Speaker 4>neat.</v>

1913
01:47:28.891 --> 01:47:31.350
<v Speaker 4>You also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is a deeper critique,</v>

1914
01:47:31.351 --> 01:47:35.100
<v Speaker 4>I think nature really criticized </v>
<v Speaker 4>institutional Christianity,</v>

1915
01:47:35.101 --> 01:47:37.900
<v Speaker 4>particularly the Protestant and Catholic</v>
<v Speaker 4>form.</v>

1916
01:47:37.901 --> 01:47:38.734
<v Speaker 4>So I would say for insufficient </v>
<v Speaker 4>attention paid to the imitation of </v>

1917
01:47:42.121 --> 01:47:46.410
<v Speaker 4>Christ and too much attention paid to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea that the work of redemption had</v>

1918
01:47:46.411 --> 01:47:50.520
<v Speaker 4>already been done,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is something that also divides the</v>

1919
01:47:50.520 --> 01:47:51.353
<v Speaker 4>Orthodox Christian types from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Protestants and the Catholics because </v>

1920
01:47:52.921 --> 01:47:53.754
<v Speaker 4>the orthodox types tend to tilt more </v>
<v Speaker 4>towards the moral demand that you </v>

1921
01:47:57.391 --> 01:48:01.140
<v Speaker 4>imitate Christ in your own life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so Nietzsche is a very.</v>

1922
01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:03.153
<v Speaker 4>You can't sum up very easily and I found</v>
<v Speaker 4>him extraordinarily useful in training </v>

1923
01:48:08.491 --> 01:48:10.950
<v Speaker 4>me how to think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to say,</v>

1924
01:48:11.040 --> 01:48:11.873
<v Speaker 4>to say that you agree with him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that you can say with </v>

1925
01:48:14.581 --> 01:48:18.680
<v Speaker 4>someone like nature that you agree with </v>
<v Speaker 4>him because you know nature had.</v>

1926
01:48:18.870 --> 01:48:19.703
<v Speaker 4>This is one thing that needs said that I</v>
<v Speaker 4>really got a kick out of because it was </v>

1927
01:48:22.441 --> 01:48:23.274
<v Speaker 4>the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the most most arrogant statement </v>

1928
01:48:25.681 --> 01:48:28.710
<v Speaker 4>I've ever heard anyone make.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>

1929
01:48:30.760 --> 01:48:33.790
<v Speaker 4>I can write in a sentence what it takes </v>
<v Speaker 4>other people,</v>

1930
01:48:35.110 --> 01:48:36.280
<v Speaker 4>a book to relate.</v>

1931
01:48:37.740 --> 01:48:38.573
<v Speaker 4>And then he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now what other people can't even relate </v>

1932
01:48:40.120 --> 01:48:42.990
<v Speaker 4>in a book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's exactly right.</v>

1933
01:48:42.991 --> 01:48:45.180
<v Speaker 4>Like if you read beyond good and evil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

1934
01:48:45.181 --> 01:48:49.410
<v Speaker 4>which is mostly aphorisms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So because he was a very sick man and he</v>

1935
01:48:49.411 --> 01:48:50.244
<v Speaker 4>couldn't write for long periods of time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he would think for long periods of </v>

1936
01:48:53.191 --> 01:48:56.190
<v Speaker 4>time and then write down a little bomb </v>
<v Speaker 4>and beyond,</v>

1937
01:48:56.191 --> 01:48:57.024
<v Speaker 4>good and evil is just sequential pieces </v>
<v Speaker 4>of dynamite and he wasn't trying to be </v>

1938
01:49:03.061 --> 01:49:03.894
<v Speaker 4>systematic precisely and so that's why </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not so easy to agree or disagree </v>

1939
01:49:07.471 --> 01:49:10.770
<v Speaker 4>with nature,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can sure let the bombs go off in</v>

1940
01:49:10.771 --> 01:49:13.830
<v Speaker 4>your brain if you read what he has to </v>
<v Speaker 4>say and he.</v>

1941
01:49:14.790 --> 01:49:15.623
<v Speaker 4>He was an interesting critic of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Christianity because you know if you're </v>

1942
01:49:19.590 --> 01:49:20.423
<v Speaker 4>all warped and bent and someone comes </v>
<v Speaker 4>along and tells you how your warped in </v>

1943
01:49:23.661 --> 01:49:26.130
<v Speaker 4>bent in a manner that might enable you </v>
<v Speaker 4>to straighten up,</v>

1944
01:49:26.160 --> 01:49:28.560
<v Speaker 4>it's not obvious that they're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That you're their enemy,</v>

1945
01:49:29.990 --> 01:49:30.823
<v Speaker 4>that they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're your enemy and I think that's </v>

1946
01:49:32.691 --> 01:49:35.480
<v Speaker 4>the right way to read nature with </v>
<v Speaker 4>regards to Christianity.</v>

1947
01:49:36.680 --> 01:49:41.680
<v Speaker 4>So he there was plenty of wrought and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that was part of what was causing,</v>

1948
01:49:43.071 --> 01:49:44.600
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the death of God.</v>

1949
01:49:45.470 --> 01:49:46.303
<v Speaker 4>Now it obvious at all that nature was </v>
<v Speaker 4>antithetically opposed to the founding </v>

1950
01:49:52.901 --> 01:49:54.790
<v Speaker 4>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>

1951
01:49:54.791 --> 01:49:58.120
<v Speaker 4>there's many places where he writes that</v>
<v Speaker 4>indicate quite the contrary,</v>

1952
01:49:58.870 --> 01:49:59.703
<v Speaker 4>so</v>

1953
01:50:00.840 --> 01:50:01.673
<v Speaker 8>thank you.</v>

1954
01:50:02.910 --> 01:50:03.743
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're going to go to Alex and then </v>

1955
01:50:04.981 --> 01:50:05.814
<v Speaker 1>say it.</v>

1956
01:50:06.630 --> 01:50:07.960
<v Speaker 8>It's going to distribute the microphone.</v>

1957
01:50:16.980 --> 01:50:18.900
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for being here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really appreciate it.</v>

1958
01:50:18.980 --> 01:50:19.813
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I was watching a few of your </v>

1959
01:50:21.240 --> 01:50:22.073
<v Speaker 1>interviews in preparation for this and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>heard you speak about religion quite a </v>

1960
01:50:26.161 --> 01:50:30.000
<v Speaker 1>bit and if you look up what religion </v>
<v Speaker 1>means in the webster dictionary,</v>

1961
01:50:30.001 --> 01:50:30.834
<v Speaker 1>you get something like a system of faith</v>
<v Speaker 1>centered on a supernatural being or </v>

1962
01:50:35.761 --> 01:50:36.594
<v Speaker 1>beings or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I've heard you use religion to </v>

1963
01:50:38.761 --> 01:50:40.890
<v Speaker 1>describe things like punk rockers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

1964
01:50:40.960 --> 01:50:44.760
<v Speaker 1>That's a religious experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my first question would be how do you</v>

1965
01:50:44.761 --> 01:50:49.320
<v Speaker 1>define what is considered religious?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then sort of as a followup to that,</v>

1966
01:50:50.490 --> 01:50:52.300
<v Speaker 1>if say Sam Harris,</v>

1967
01:50:52.760 --> 01:50:54.630
<v Speaker 4>act out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's that?</v>

1968
01:50:55.740 --> 01:50:59.850
<v Speaker 4>Religious is what you act out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anything you act out,</v>

1969
01:51:00.990 --> 01:51:05.640
<v Speaker 4>everything you act out is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is predicated on your implicit axioms.</v>

1970
01:51:05.850 --> 01:51:06.683
<v Speaker 4>And the system of implicit axioms that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you hold as primary is your religious </v>

1971
01:51:10.201 --> 01:51:11.034
<v Speaker 4>belief system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter whether you're an </v>

1972
01:51:12.481 --> 01:51:15.570
<v Speaker 4>atheist or not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's just surface,</v>

1973
01:51:16.380 --> 01:51:18.420
<v Speaker 4>that's just surface noise.</v>

1974
01:51:19.140 --> 01:51:19.973
<v Speaker 1>So it has nothing to do with divinity or</v>
<v Speaker 1>natural or it doesn't necessarily have </v>

1975
01:51:25.141 --> 01:51:25.974
<v Speaker 1>to do with those.</v>

1976
01:51:27.430 --> 01:51:28.263
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it probably necessarily has to do with </v>

1977
01:51:29.891 --> 01:51:32.020
<v Speaker 4>it too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't necessarily have anything</v>

1978
01:51:32.021 --> 01:51:32.854
<v Speaker 4>to do with your voluntarily articulated </v>
<v Speaker 4>statements about whether or not you </v>

1979
01:51:36.671 --> 01:51:39.400
<v Speaker 4>believe in something like a transcendent</v>
<v Speaker 4>deity.</v>

1980
01:51:40.270 --> 01:51:41.103
<v Speaker 4>So mean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What you act out is much more what you </v>

1981
01:51:43.811 --> 01:51:46.570
<v Speaker 4>are then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you say about yourself and what the</v>

1982
01:51:46.571 --> 01:51:48.760
<v Speaker 4>hell do you know about what you believe </v>
<v Speaker 4>anyways,</v>

1983
01:51:49.480 --> 01:51:51.100
<v Speaker 4>you're complicated math.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Their question.</v>

1984
01:51:51.190 --> 01:51:53.290
<v Speaker 4>Well seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people are complicated.</v>

1985
01:51:53.830 --> 01:51:54.790
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like we're,</v>

1986
01:51:54.850 --> 01:51:55.683
<v Speaker 4>we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're not transparent to ourselves at </v>

1987
01:51:56.771 --> 01:51:58.210
<v Speaker 4>all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why we,</v>

1988
01:51:58.390 --> 01:52:00.850
<v Speaker 4>that's why we have to go to university </v>
<v Speaker 4>and study psychology.</v>

1989
01:52:00.851 --> 01:52:01.810
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1990
01:52:01.890 --> 01:52:02.500
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>

1991
01:52:02.500 --> 01:52:03.333
<v Speaker 4>we're not exactly black boxes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we are the most complicated things </v>

1992
01:52:06.851 --> 01:52:08.590
<v Speaker 4>there are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1993
01:52:08.591 --> 01:52:11.410
<v Speaker 4>And we can't even program our VCR </v>
<v Speaker 4>clocks.</v>

1994
01:52:11.650 --> 01:52:16.650
<v Speaker 4>So it's like how the hell can we propose</v>
<v Speaker 4>to understand ourselves and you know I'm</v>

1995
01:52:17.680 --> 01:52:18.513
<v Speaker 4>existentially oriented,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is to say that I think that what </v>

1996
01:52:22.091 --> 01:52:27.091
<v Speaker 4>you hold to be true is best determined </v>
<v Speaker 4>as an as a consequence of an analysis of</v>

1997
01:52:27.551 --> 01:52:28.384
<v Speaker 4>your actions rather than as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>consequence of an analysis of what you </v>

1998
01:52:32.261 --> 01:52:33.610
<v Speaker 4>purport to believe.</v>

1999
01:52:34.840 --> 01:52:35.673
<v Speaker 4>Now in order to act,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't act without a hierarchy of </v>

2000
01:52:39.161 --> 01:52:39.994
<v Speaker 4>value,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I tortured the other poor </v>

2001
01:52:40.941 --> 01:52:41.774
<v Speaker 4>questionnaire about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't act without a hierarchy of </v>

2002
01:52:44.111 --> 01:52:44.944
<v Speaker 4>values because you can't act unless you </v>
<v Speaker 4>think one thing is better than another </v>

2003
01:52:48.080 --> 01:52:50.450
<v Speaker 4>because why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why would you act otherwise?</v>

2004
01:52:50.660 --> 01:52:53.840
<v Speaker 4>So that means that you're embedded </v>
<v Speaker 4>within a hierarchy of values,</v>

2005
01:52:54.230 --> 01:52:55.063
<v Speaker 4>whether you know it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or maybe multiple fragmentary and </v>

2006
01:52:56.961 --> 01:52:57.794
<v Speaker 4>competing hierarchies of value,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is all the worst for you by the </v>

2007
01:53:00.291 --> 01:53:02.360
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it just makes you very confused.</v>

2008
01:53:03.140 --> 01:53:06.230
<v Speaker 4>That hierarchy of values has an </v>
<v Speaker 4>axiomatic.</v>

2009
01:53:06.720 --> 01:53:07.553
<v Speaker 4>It's based on axioms and the probability</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you understand them is very low </v>

2010
01:53:11.810 --> 01:53:14.180
<v Speaker 4>because generally people don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand their axioms,</v>

2011
01:53:14.450 --> 01:53:19.160
<v Speaker 4>but that axiomatic system is essentially</v>
<v Speaker 4>your religious system and there's.</v>

2012
01:53:19.280 --> 01:53:21.560
<v Speaker 4>There's no way out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As far as I can tell,</v>

2013
01:53:21.800 --> 01:53:22.640
<v Speaker 4>and you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2014
01:53:22.641 --> 01:53:27.641
<v Speaker 4>it isn't predicated on conscious belief </v>
<v Speaker 4>in a transcendent deity.</v>

2015
01:53:27.670 --> 01:53:28.503
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2016
01:53:28.820 --> 01:53:31.190
<v Speaker 4>have it your way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

2017
01:53:32.240 --> 01:53:37.240
<v Speaker 4>most people in this room act out a Judeo</v>
<v Speaker 4>Christian ethic and not only do they act</v>

2018
01:53:38.211 --> 01:53:43.040
<v Speaker 4>it out if they're treated in a manner </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not commensurate with that ethic,</v>

2019
01:53:43.160 --> 01:53:44.540
<v Speaker 4>they get very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>

2020
01:53:44.570 --> 01:53:47.270
<v Speaker 4>very annoyed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So for example,</v>

2021
01:53:47.271 --> 01:53:52.271
<v Speaker 4>if I failed to treat you as if you're an</v>
<v Speaker 4>embodiment of a divine fragment,</v>

2022
01:53:53.421 --> 01:53:54.254
<v Speaker 4>let's say that's characterized by the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ability to the ability to make free </v>

2023
01:53:58.431 --> 01:54:01.880
<v Speaker 4>choice and to determine your own destiny</v>
<v Speaker 4>in some sense,</v>

2024
01:54:02.540 --> 01:54:05.990
<v Speaker 4>or if I fail to treat you as if you're a</v>
<v Speaker 4>valued member,</v>

2025
01:54:06.020 --> 01:54:06.853
<v Speaker 4>valued,</v>
<v Speaker 4>contributing member of the polity as a </v>

2026
01:54:09.410 --> 01:54:12.740
<v Speaker 4>sovereign individual,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you'll find that very offensive and</v>

2027
01:54:12.741 --> 01:54:14.060
<v Speaker 4>become angry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2028
01:54:14.120 --> 01:54:17.000
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then that's what you believe.</v>

2029
01:54:18.140 --> 01:54:19.250
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I ask you,</v>

2030
01:54:19.251 --> 01:54:21.770
<v Speaker 4>if you believe any of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well that's a whole different story.</v>

2031
01:54:21.771 --> 01:54:24.500
<v Speaker 4>You might give me some radical leftist </v>
<v Speaker 4>nonsense,</v>

2032
01:54:24.920 --> 01:54:27.650
<v Speaker 4>but that doesn't translate from what </v>
<v Speaker 4>you've.</v>

2033
01:54:28.610 --> 01:54:31.370
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't take away from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fundamentals of your auction</v>

2034
01:54:33.680 --> 01:54:34.513
<v Speaker 4>as one final thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when you say Sam Harris argue about </v>

2035
01:54:37.730 --> 01:54:38.563
<v Speaker 4>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're arguing about fundamentally </v>

2036
01:54:39.681 --> 01:54:43.130
<v Speaker 4>different things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It sounds like his conception of what is</v>

2037
01:54:43.131 --> 01:54:45.710
<v Speaker 4>religious is very different from yours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2038
01:54:45.711 --> 01:54:46.544
<v Speaker 4>Well he tends to think of religious </v>
<v Speaker 4>religious thought the same way that a </v>

2039
01:54:50.931 --> 01:54:55.160
<v Speaker 4>smart 13 year old atheist thinks about a</v>
<v Speaker 4>fundamentalist Christian.</v>

2040
01:54:56.140 --> 01:54:56.961
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2041
01:54:56.961 --> 01:54:59.240
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That just,</v>

2042
01:54:59.420 --> 01:55:01.400
<v Speaker 4>you're just not getting to the heart of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the matter.</v>

2043
01:55:01.550 --> 01:55:04.030
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I just finished reading all of Sam's</v>

2044
01:55:04.040 --> 01:55:07.760
<v Speaker 4>books in the last couple of weeks and as</v>
<v Speaker 4>far as I'm concerned,</v>

2045
01:55:07.761 --> 01:55:11.120
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't ever get to the bottom of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>issue.</v>

2046
01:55:11.121 --> 01:55:13.340
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't address the fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinkers.</v>

2047
01:55:13.430 --> 01:55:18.430
<v Speaker 4>There are some profound thinkers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dostoevsky's one toll story Nicha young.</v>

2048
01:55:20.030 --> 01:55:21.650
<v Speaker 4>It's like they're completely absent </v>
<v Speaker 4>from.</v>

2049
01:55:21.700 --> 01:55:23.990
<v Speaker 4>And the same with Dawkins,</v>
<v Speaker 4>completely absent.</v>

2050
01:55:23.991 --> 01:55:27.290
<v Speaker 4>All that conceptualization is completely</v>
<v Speaker 4>absent from their Corpus of works.</v>

2051
01:55:27.920 --> 01:55:28.753
<v Speaker 4>They don't even have an understanding </v>
<v Speaker 4>for the psychological utility of </v>

2052
01:55:30.921 --> 01:55:33.470
<v Speaker 4>religion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's a big problem.</v>

2053
01:55:33.800 --> 01:55:34.200
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

2054
01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:38.660
<v Speaker 4>you don't get to be an atheist when the </v>
<v Speaker 4>people you attack or fundamental like,</v>

2055
01:55:38.890 --> 01:55:39.723
<v Speaker 4>like naive fundamentalists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I have some sympathy for the naive </v>

2056
01:55:43.531 --> 01:55:44.300
<v Speaker 4>fundamentalists,</v>

2057
01:55:44.300 --> 01:55:46.950
<v Speaker 3>just like what they're basically saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>is something like this,</v>

2058
01:55:47.510 --> 01:55:49.650
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have an ethos that's valuable.</v>

2059
01:55:51.690 --> 01:55:54.570
<v Speaker 3>You scientists types are casually </v>
<v Speaker 3>dismantling it.</v>

2060
01:55:55.290 --> 01:55:57.680
<v Speaker 3>What the hell are we supposed to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

2061
01:55:57.681 --> 01:55:59.460
<v Speaker 3>The fundamentalists don't know what to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do about that.</v>

2062
01:55:59.461 --> 01:56:00.091
<v Speaker 3>So they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2063
01:56:00.091 --> 01:56:02.100
<v Speaker 3>creationism is science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2064
01:56:02.101 --> 01:56:02.934
<v Speaker 3>well no it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that doesn't mean that they don't </v>

2065
01:56:05.191 --> 01:56:07.350
<v Speaker 3>have a point there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Point,</v>

2066
01:56:07.351 --> 01:56:09.270
<v Speaker 3>is there something valuable here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2067
01:56:09.390 --> 01:56:12.000
<v Speaker 3>don't break it casually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you gonna?</v>

2068
01:56:12.010 --> 01:56:12.843
<v Speaker 3>Replace it with the new atheists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Swiss wish that everybody becomes </v>

2069
01:56:16.411 --> 01:56:17.910
<v Speaker 3>rational.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2070
01:56:17.911 --> 01:56:19.420
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure that's going to happen.</v>

2071
01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:21.473
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

2072
01:56:24.100 --> 01:56:25.960
<v Speaker 9>Thank you Dr Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm A.</v>

2073
01:56:25.960 --> 01:56:26.793
<v Speaker 9>I'm a student of the religious studies </v>
<v Speaker 9>and and currently I'm writing an honors </v>

2074
01:56:29.261 --> 01:56:33.850
<v Speaker 9>thesis on religious imagery in an </v>
<v Speaker 9>Indonesian literary genre.</v>

2075
01:56:34.430 --> 01:56:36.370
<v Speaker 9>There's a poet,</v>
<v Speaker 9>philosopher who said the following,</v>

2076
01:56:36.371 --> 01:56:39.280
<v Speaker 9>which I think you like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>who by the way was a huge fan of goiter.</v>

2077
01:56:39.610 --> 01:56:41.740
<v Speaker 9>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you said that in addressing God,</v>

2078
01:56:41.770 --> 01:56:42.603
<v Speaker 9>he says he calls him the hidden reality </v>
<v Speaker 9>and he asks that hidden reality to </v>

2079
01:56:45.971 --> 01:56:46.804
<v Speaker 9>reveal itself,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but using the robe of metro for because </v>

2080
01:56:49.091 --> 01:56:49.924
<v Speaker 9>he thinks that metaphor is the only way.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I think stories are the only way that </v>

2081
01:56:53.531 --> 01:56:55.700
<v Speaker 9>human beings can comprehend,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

2082
01:56:55.701 --> 01:56:56.680
<v Speaker 9>the,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the hidden reality.</v>

2083
01:56:57.220 --> 01:56:59.740
<v Speaker 9>I know you've written a lot of you,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you speak a lot about,</v>

2084
01:56:59.770 --> 01:57:01.570
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>about real stories.</v>

2085
01:57:01.571 --> 01:57:02.404
<v Speaker 9>I just wanted to ask you,</v>
<v Speaker 9>although it may be a very broad </v>

2086
01:57:04.511 --> 01:57:05.344
<v Speaker 9>question,</v>
<v Speaker 9>what is the place of the religious in </v>

2087
01:57:08.260 --> 01:57:10.320
<v Speaker 9>stories and uh,</v>

2088
01:57:10.640 --> 01:57:11.473
<v Speaker 3>you're religious is something like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>grammatical structure of stories I give </v>

2089
01:57:15.181 --> 01:57:20.181
<v Speaker 3>you go down and you look at what makes a</v>
<v Speaker 3>story a story that's religious.</v>

2090
01:57:21.150 --> 01:57:21.983
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a story otherwise like a story </v>

2091
01:57:23.881 --> 01:57:27.030
<v Speaker 3>as a particular sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like in its simplest sense,</v>

2092
01:57:27.031 --> 01:57:30.510
<v Speaker 3>the story is an account of how to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>from point a to point b.</v>

2093
01:57:31.980 --> 01:57:32.813
<v Speaker 3>it's like a map,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a value structure inherent </v>

2094
01:57:35.881 --> 01:57:39.150
<v Speaker 3>in that obviously because otherwise you </v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't go from point a to point b.</v>

2095
01:57:39.570 --> 01:57:42.210
<v Speaker 3>So just to make the map means to adopt a</v>
<v Speaker 3>value structure.</v>

2096
01:57:42.211 --> 01:57:43.044
<v Speaker 3>But there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the story is actually more </v>

2097
01:57:43.651 --> 01:57:47.100
<v Speaker 3>complicated than that because as you </v>
<v Speaker 3>move from point a to point b,</v>

2098
01:57:47.460 --> 01:57:48.293
<v Speaker 3>processes of radical transformation are </v>
<v Speaker 3>often necessary and the deep stories </v>

2099
01:57:54.031 --> 01:57:54.864
<v Speaker 3>about the processes of radical </v>
<v Speaker 3>transformation that occur as you move </v>

2100
01:57:57.811 --> 01:57:58.644
<v Speaker 3>from point a to b are basically they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>indistinguishable from religious </v>

2101
01:58:02.491 --> 01:58:03.324
<v Speaker 3>stories.</v>

2102
01:58:03.810 --> 01:58:07.710
<v Speaker 3>Now the reason they I think the reason </v>
<v Speaker 3>they they tend to become religious,</v>

2103
01:58:07.711 --> 01:58:08.544
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is because it has something to do with </v>

2104
01:58:10.111 --> 01:58:10.944
<v Speaker 3>the gap between the finite and </v>
<v Speaker 3>comprehensible and the infinite and </v>

2105
01:58:14.281 --> 01:58:15.114
<v Speaker 3>uncomprehensible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like we live in the finite and </v>

2106
01:58:17.131 --> 01:58:19.710
<v Speaker 3>comprehensible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we're surrounded by the infinite and</v>

2107
01:58:19.711 --> 01:58:22.770
<v Speaker 3>incomprehensible and there has to be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>border between those.</v>

2108
01:58:22.920 --> 01:58:26.190
<v Speaker 3>Have some like a mediating border.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's poetry and art.</v>

2109
01:58:26.490 --> 01:58:29.580
<v Speaker 3>That's narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's religion and it's that.</v>

2110
01:58:29.730 --> 01:58:30.563
<v Speaker 3>It's that strange metaphorical reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say that's not factual and it's </v>

2111
01:58:35.371 --> 01:58:36.204
<v Speaker 3>not comprehensible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's not infinitely </v>

2112
01:58:38.161 --> 01:58:40.860
<v Speaker 3>incomprehensible either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a bridge between the two.</v>

2113
01:58:41.550 --> 01:58:42.383
<v Speaker 3>So and as you move closer to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>infinite and incomprehensible across </v>

2114
01:58:47.111 --> 01:58:47.944
<v Speaker 3>that bridge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get farther and farther away from </v>

2115
01:58:50.261 --> 01:58:51.610
<v Speaker 3>what you understand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2116
01:58:51.670 --> 01:58:54.760
<v Speaker 3>But how could it be otherwise given that</v>
<v Speaker 3>your finite,</v>

2117
01:58:55.150 --> 01:58:59.110
<v Speaker 3>you are a finite being surrounded by </v>
<v Speaker 3>infinite,</v>

2118
01:58:59.730 --> 01:59:01.990
<v Speaker 3>it's infinite in incomprehensible.</v>

2119
01:59:02.450 --> 01:59:06.330
<v Speaker 9>And that was his critique of district </v>
<v Speaker 9>rationalist and they can't do that.</v>

2120
01:59:06.331 --> 01:59:08.930
<v Speaker 9>It's hard for them to,</v>
<v Speaker 9>to make this a two.</v>

2121
01:59:09.030 --> 01:59:11.940
<v Speaker 9>That's what poets come in.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And that's exactly.</v>

2122
01:59:11.941 --> 01:59:12.780
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>this is what I learned</v>

2123
01:59:12.860 --> 01:59:13.693
<v Speaker 3>a lot of this from young because young </v>
<v Speaker 3>is his idea was that rationality is </v>

2124
01:59:17.121 --> 01:59:20.890
<v Speaker 3>embedded in a dream,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's the infinite unknowable.</v>

2125
01:59:20.900 --> 01:59:21.733
<v Speaker 3>And then there's the dream.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then inside the dream is the </v>

2126
01:59:24.381 --> 01:59:25.920
<v Speaker 3>rational domain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

2127
01:59:25.960 --> 01:59:29.360
<v Speaker 3>I believe that to be the case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why else would we dream?</v>

2128
01:59:30.890 --> 01:59:33.170
<v Speaker 3>We have to dream.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we don't dream,</v>

2129
01:59:33.180 --> 01:59:36.200
<v Speaker 3>we would go insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't take very long.</v>

2130
01:59:37.070 --> 01:59:39.830
<v Speaker 3>And so there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's an element of poetic</v>

2131
01:59:41.900 --> 01:59:46.730
<v Speaker 3>conceptualization that grounds us and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>has to be taken seriously.</v>

2132
01:59:47.200 --> 01:59:48.033
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2133
01:59:48.140 --> 01:59:52.650
<v Speaker 3>the rational critics of dreams think </v>
<v Speaker 3>about them as random neuroactivity.</v>

2134
01:59:52.940 --> 01:59:53.773
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's nothing wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you look at a TV screen that's not </v>

2135
01:59:57.981 --> 01:59:58.814
<v Speaker 3>on a channel that's random.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you dream something complex and </v>

2136
02:00:03.441 --> 02:00:06.140
<v Speaker 3>sophisticated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not random.</v>

2137
02:00:08.060 --> 02:00:12.140
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the metaphor surrounds us,</v>

2138
02:00:12.141 --> 02:00:14.630
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we can critique it rationally and we</v>

2139
02:00:14.631 --> 02:00:16.760
<v Speaker 3>can undermine it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's real danger in that.</v>

2140
02:00:17.360 --> 02:00:21.090
<v Speaker 10>So.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Sure.</v>

2141
02:00:27.710 --> 02:00:29.780
<v Speaker 9>Take one question from here,</v>
<v Speaker 9>then take one on the other end.</v>

2142
02:00:31.990 --> 02:00:36.990
<v Speaker 9>We have a right side of the loom bias.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Hi Professor.</v>

2143
02:00:40.100 --> 02:00:40.933
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 9>thanks you for a dark and I explained </v>

2144
02:00:42.280 --> 02:00:43.540
<v Speaker 9>out to from you,</v>
<v Speaker 9>um,</v>

2145
02:00:43.940 --> 02:00:44.773
<v Speaker 9>what's your view of institutional racism</v>
<v Speaker 9>visit a thing or is it some other lefty </v>

2146
02:00:50.590 --> 02:00:53.310
<v Speaker 9>radical leftist agenda?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Say,</v>

2147
02:00:53.390 --> 02:00:54.223
<v Speaker 9>I didn't quite get to the first.</v>
<v Speaker 9>What was your view of institutional </v>

2148
02:00:57.141 --> 02:00:57.974
<v Speaker 9>racism?</v>
<v Speaker 9>More systematic racism as some people </v>

2149
02:00:59.451 --> 02:01:02.170
<v Speaker 9>may call it a system.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>

2150
02:01:02.230 --> 02:01:02.740
<v Speaker 9>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 9>yes,</v>

2151
02:01:02.740 --> 02:01:04.790
<v Speaker 9>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Is it a,</v>

2152
02:01:04.820 --> 02:01:06.770
<v Speaker 9>is it a thing?</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's an actual thing</v>

2153
02:01:08.420 --> 02:01:13.420
<v Speaker 9>that his mother had agenda that you </v>
<v Speaker 9>might attribute to radical leftists.</v>

2154
02:01:13.840 --> 02:01:17.350
<v Speaker 3>It's a multivariate problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2155
02:01:17.430 --> 02:01:18.263
<v Speaker 3>Like no society is without its biases </v>
<v Speaker 3>and prejudices and some of them get </v>

2156
02:01:22.781 --> 02:01:27.781
<v Speaker 3>built into the systems themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so when you look at unequal outcomes</v>

2157
02:01:28.301 --> 02:01:31.480
<v Speaker 3>and you're trying to discover why those </v>
<v Speaker 3>unequal outcomes exist,</v>

2158
02:01:31.750 --> 02:01:32.583
<v Speaker 3>if you have any sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you do a multivariate analysis and </v>

2159
02:01:35.021 --> 02:01:38.860
<v Speaker 3>you put in prejudice and discrimination </v>
<v Speaker 3>as one of the factors,</v>

2160
02:01:39.350 --> 02:01:40.070
<v Speaker 3>one of</v>

2161
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:42.440
<v Speaker 4>the factors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of many,</v>

2162
02:01:42.530 --> 02:01:43.363
<v Speaker 4>many factors and what the problem with </v>
<v Speaker 4>the radical leftist is that they take </v>

2163
02:01:48.020 --> 02:01:52.250
<v Speaker 4>the fact that societal structures are </v>
<v Speaker 4>tyrannical to some degree and arbitrary,</v>

2164
02:01:52.310 --> 02:01:53.143
<v Speaker 4>which of course they are because they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>imperfect and then they obliterate the </v>

2165
02:01:57.171 --> 02:01:58.004
<v Speaker 4>rest of the complexity with that claim.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's lots of reasons for </v>

2166
02:02:02.211 --> 02:02:05.350
<v Speaker 4>inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>systemic biases,</v>

2167
02:02:05.390 --> 02:02:07.070
<v Speaker 4>one of the two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what did.</v>

2168
02:02:07.560 --> 02:02:11.600
<v Speaker 4>It's an open question to what degree </v>
<v Speaker 4>systemic bias plays in,</v>

2169
02:02:12.080 --> 02:02:14.780
<v Speaker 4>in the inequality problem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>

2170
02:02:15.320 --> 02:02:16.153
<v Speaker 4>but it's something that we could </v>
<v Speaker 4>hypothetically address with a certain </v>

2171
02:02:18.861 --> 02:02:23.861
<v Speaker 4>degree of detachment and intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So no system is perfect,</v>

2172
02:02:25.370 --> 02:02:27.350
<v Speaker 4>not and certainly not all</v>

2173
02:02:30.940 --> 02:02:33.130
<v Speaker 8>reasonable reasonable answer.</v>

2174
02:02:35.370 --> 02:02:39.900
<v Speaker 11>That stuff's yes.</v>
<v Speaker 11>All right.</v>

2175
02:02:39.960 --> 02:02:40.793
<v Speaker 11>So I think it's safe to say you're a </v>
<v Speaker 11>fervent of postmodernism and there are </v>

2176
02:02:45.931 --> 02:02:50.910
<v Speaker 11>times where I don't think you quite give</v>
<v Speaker 11>it a fair shake and I'm no fan of,</v>

2177
02:02:51.420 --> 02:02:52.253
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 11>a good amount of the literature or the </v>

2178
02:02:52.831 --> 02:02:53.664
<v Speaker 11>theory,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but if you could point to one or two of </v>

2179
02:02:56.791 --> 02:02:59.220
<v Speaker 11>the French theorists and some of their </v>
<v Speaker 11>pieces,</v>

2180
02:02:59.570 --> 02:03:00.870
<v Speaker 11>what are,</v>
<v Speaker 11>whether it's their literature,</v>

2181
02:03:00.871 --> 02:03:02.460
<v Speaker 11>their theory,</v>
<v Speaker 11>um,</v>

2182
02:03:02.850 --> 02:03:03.683
<v Speaker 11>or you could point to that's called for </v>
<v Speaker 11>this sort of cultural rot that you </v>

2183
02:03:05.761 --> 02:03:08.700
<v Speaker 11>charge postmodernism with causing,</v>
<v Speaker 11>who would it be,</v>

2184
02:03:08.730 --> 02:03:09.563
<v Speaker 11>what would it be?</v>

2185
02:03:11.190 --> 02:03:12.530
<v Speaker 8>I would say for Colon,</v>

2186
02:03:14.330 --> 02:03:16.720
<v Speaker 11>well,</v>
<v Speaker 11>if I could understand it,</v>

2187
02:03:16.721 --> 02:03:18.620
<v Speaker 11>but I think he is understanding</v>

2188
02:03:18.850 --> 02:03:21.170
<v Speaker 4>so I can't blame him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2189
02:03:21.780 --> 02:03:22.613
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I've done my best to read and I </v>

2190
02:03:24.291 --> 02:03:27.410
<v Speaker 4>think the reason I can't read it is </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it doesn't make any sense.</v>

2191
02:03:27.880 --> 02:03:31.370
<v Speaker 4>So because I've read some very difficult</v>
<v Speaker 4>things and I could understand them.</v>

2192
02:03:31.790 --> 02:03:33.140
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2193
02:03:33.550 --> 02:03:34.383
<v Speaker 4>for coal I think is a tin part genius.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I read Madison's civilization for </v>

2194
02:03:37.881 --> 02:03:39.860
<v Speaker 4>example.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just seems to me to be self evident.</v>

2195
02:03:40.550 --> 02:03:44.120
<v Speaker 4>Psychiatric diagnostic categories are in</v>
<v Speaker 4>part social constructions.</v>

2196
02:03:44.150 --> 02:03:46.970
<v Speaker 4>It's like great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've known that since late 1960,</v>

2197
02:03:47.300 --> 02:03:48.133
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just not that big a revelation and </v>

2198
02:03:50.661 --> 02:03:51.471
<v Speaker 4>Dera Dot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2199
02:03:51.471 --> 02:03:52.660
<v Speaker 4>he's a trickster,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2200
02:03:52.661 --> 02:03:56.690
<v Speaker 4>in his critique of the West as logo </v>
<v Speaker 4>centric is dead on point.</v>

2201
02:03:57.320 --> 02:04:00.860
<v Speaker 4>Male dominated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's his theory and logo centric.</v>

2202
02:04:00.861 --> 02:04:03.860
<v Speaker 4>While he thinks that's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well I don't think it's a problem.</v>

2203
02:04:05.120 --> 02:04:08.420
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think as well it isn't even that,</v>

2204
02:04:08.421 --> 02:04:10.640
<v Speaker 4>and I understand the postmodernist </v>
<v Speaker 4>viewpoint,</v>

2205
02:04:10.670 --> 02:04:11.503
<v Speaker 4>like look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is the case that a finite set of </v>

2206
02:04:14.391 --> 02:04:17.300
<v Speaker 4>entities is subject to an infinite </v>
<v Speaker 4>number of interpretations.</v>

2207
02:04:17.660 --> 02:04:19.610
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's postmodernism in a nutshell.</v>

2208
02:04:19.730 --> 02:04:24.170
<v Speaker 4>The Ai guys figured that out and like </v>
<v Speaker 4>from 1960 to 1992,</v>

2209
02:04:24.410 --> 02:04:28.010
<v Speaker 4>it took them that long to wade through </v>
<v Speaker 4>that fundamental technical problem,</v>

2210
02:04:28.190 --> 02:04:30.350
<v Speaker 4>a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The problem of perception,</v>

2211
02:04:30.351 --> 02:04:31.184
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's been very hard to solve the ai </v>

2212
02:04:32.751 --> 02:04:35.660
<v Speaker 4>problem of perception because there are </v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of ways to look at the world.</v>

2213
02:04:35.960 --> 02:04:38.460
<v Speaker 4>Like the objects aren't just there in </v>
<v Speaker 4>any simple sense.</v>

2214
02:04:38.850 --> 02:04:39.421
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2215
02:04:39.421 --> 02:04:41.400
<v Speaker 4>there's an infinite number of </v>
<v Speaker 4>interpretations.</v>

2216
02:04:41.790 --> 02:04:45.420
<v Speaker 4>No problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's not an infinite number of viable</v>

2217
02:04:45.421 --> 02:04:47.070
<v Speaker 4>interpretations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

2218
02:04:47.160 --> 02:04:49.120
<v Speaker 4>that's a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2219
02:04:49.140 --> 02:04:52.380
<v Speaker 4>And a little bit of thinking through </v>
<v Speaker 4>that would have gone a long ways for the</v>

2220
02:04:52.381 --> 02:04:53.520
<v Speaker 4>postmodernist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's,</v>

2221
02:04:53.690 --> 02:04:57.270
<v Speaker 4>that's number one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then what's the other one?</v>

2222
02:05:01.920 --> 02:05:04.020
<v Speaker 4>Oh yes they did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then the other problem is,</v>

2223
02:05:04.021 --> 02:05:04.854
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's an infinite number of </v>

2224
02:05:05.641 --> 02:05:07.850
<v Speaker 4>interpretations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We won't make anyone canonical.</v>

2225
02:05:08.030 --> 02:05:08.863
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well then how the hell are you going to </v>

2226
02:05:10.531 --> 02:05:11.364
<v Speaker 4>act?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because you have to make a value system </v>

2227
02:05:13.650 --> 02:05:17.190
<v Speaker 4>canonical if you're going to act.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh well we didn't solve that problem.</v>

2228
02:05:17.250 --> 02:05:18.083
<v Speaker 4>How about we just slipped Marxism and </v>
<v Speaker 4>underneath the carpet and not noticed </v>

2229
02:05:20.881 --> 02:05:23.910
<v Speaker 4>the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then that gives us something to do.</v>

2230
02:05:24.370 --> 02:05:26.910
<v Speaker 4>Like people come out and criticize me </v>
<v Speaker 4>and say,</v>

2231
02:05:26.911 --> 02:05:27.744
<v Speaker 4>Dr Peterson doesn't understand that </v>
<v Speaker 4>postmodernism and Marxism are </v>

2232
02:05:30.181 --> 02:05:31.470
<v Speaker 4>incommensurate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2233
02:05:31.710 --> 02:05:34.290
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually I do understand that.</v>

2234
02:05:34.500 --> 02:05:38.190
<v Speaker 4>But the postmodern neo Marxists don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>seem to understand that.</v>

2235
02:05:38.730 --> 02:05:42.600
<v Speaker 4>So how can you be a postmodernist marks </v>
<v Speaker 4>Marxist at the same time?</v>

2236
02:05:43.170 --> 02:05:44.003
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the answer to that is actually to be </v>

2237
02:05:44.731 --> 02:05:45.564
<v Speaker 4>found in the historical data.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The postmodernist types like Fuco and </v>

2238
02:05:48.331 --> 02:05:52.530
<v Speaker 4>Derrida were Marxists before they became</v>
<v Speaker 4>postmodernists.</v>

2239
02:05:52.680 --> 02:05:55.710
<v Speaker 4>And the postmodern overlay on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Marxism was,</v>

2240
02:05:55.711 --> 02:05:58.530
<v Speaker 4>as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mostly a cover story for going about the</v>

2241
02:05:58.531 --> 02:06:01.830
<v Speaker 4>same old murderous idiocy under a new </v>
<v Speaker 4>guys.</v>

2242
02:06:03.030 --> 02:06:03.650
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

2243
02:06:03.650 --> 02:06:08.650
<v Speaker 11>you think it's possible that there are.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I'm sorry that there are lenses.</v>

2244
02:06:09.490 --> 02:06:10.323
<v Speaker 11>I'm like postmodern lenses that we can </v>
<v Speaker 11>view culture from under that can at </v>

2245
02:06:16.161 --> 02:06:20.720
<v Speaker 11>times be more powerful and useful than </v>
<v Speaker 11>than other lenses.</v>

2246
02:06:20.721 --> 02:06:23.710
<v Speaker 11>Like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 11>the idea of the simulator.</v>

2247
02:06:23.720 --> 02:06:25.210
<v Speaker 11>Tremendous success of phases of the </v>
<v Speaker 11>image.</v>

2248
02:06:25.470 --> 02:06:27.230
<v Speaker 11>I'm Joan Didion.</v>

2249
02:06:27.770 --> 02:06:28.603
<v Speaker 4>You could at least think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I mean you can't throw all the </v>

2250
02:06:31.401 --> 02:06:34.490
<v Speaker 4>postmodernists into the same jug,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2251
02:06:34.491 --> 02:06:35.324
<v Speaker 4>but I would say it's still daredevils </v>
<v Speaker 4>who cove had the most pernicious </v>

2252
02:06:38.031 --> 02:06:39.170
<v Speaker 4>effects.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2253
02:06:39.171 --> 02:06:43.950
<v Speaker 4>So you would charge</v>
<v Speaker 4>well the.</v>

2254
02:06:45.930 --> 02:06:48.900
<v Speaker 4>Well the problem is they didn't deal </v>
<v Speaker 4>with it seriously.</v>

2255
02:06:48.901 --> 02:06:51.940
<v Speaker 4>It's like you can't just say no Meta </v>
<v Speaker 4>narrative.</v>

2256
02:06:52.110 --> 02:06:52.621
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2257
02:06:52.621 --> 02:06:53.940
<v Speaker 4>how are we going to unite ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 4>there?</v>

2258
02:06:55.050 --> 02:06:55.520
<v Speaker 10>Okay,</v>

2259
02:06:55.520 --> 02:06:57.250
<v Speaker 4>we're going to use multiculturalism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2260
02:06:57.260 --> 02:06:59.270
<v Speaker 4>that's really worked to produce a </v>
<v Speaker 4>peaceful world,</v>

2261
02:06:59.271 --> 02:07:03.140
<v Speaker 4>hasn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you need a uniting narrative.</v>

2262
02:07:03.141 --> 02:07:04.330
<v Speaker 4>We have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If we weren't,</v>

2263
02:07:04.340 --> 02:07:07.220
<v Speaker 4>didn't have a uniting narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we wouldn't all be sitting peacefully in</v>

2264
02:07:07.221 --> 02:07:08.054
<v Speaker 4>this room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the uniting narrative that governs </v>

2265
02:07:09.891 --> 02:07:13.280
<v Speaker 4>our behavior in this room and look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here we are all peaceful.</v>

2266
02:07:13.490 --> 02:07:14.323
<v Speaker 4>It's like they're not dealing with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fundamental issues and to slip Marxism </v>

2267
02:07:17.031 --> 02:07:17.864
<v Speaker 4>back in as a backdoor route to having </v>
<v Speaker 4>something to do with your life is </v>

2268
02:07:21.320 --> 02:07:22.153
<v Speaker 4>intellectually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>intellectually and morally </v>

2269
02:07:24.321 --> 02:07:25.154
<v Speaker 4>reprehensible.</v>

2270
02:07:26.020 --> 02:07:26.970
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Thank you.</v>

2271
02:07:27.880 --> 02:07:29.900
<v Speaker 8>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 8>C,</v>

2272
02:07:31.320 --> 02:07:32.153
<v Speaker 8>take one.</v>

2273
02:07:36.340 --> 02:07:38.170
<v Speaker 12>How are you sir?</v>
<v Speaker 12>My name is Steve.</v>

2274
02:07:38.470 --> 02:07:41.650
<v Speaker 12>I just wanted to ask you about this </v>
<v Speaker 12>experience that I had after watching one</v>

2275
02:07:41.651 --> 02:07:44.940
<v Speaker 12>of your lectures that really profoundly </v>
<v Speaker 12>impacted me and I was,</v>

2276
02:07:44.941 --> 02:07:45.774
<v Speaker 12>I was wondering if you could kind of </v>
<v Speaker 12>help me out with understanding this </v>

2277
02:07:48.250 --> 02:07:51.280
<v Speaker 12>after watching your lecture on young and</v>
<v Speaker 12>just talking about his life.</v>

2278
02:07:51.660 --> 02:07:52.493
<v Speaker 12>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you started talking about the lion king </v>

2279
02:07:54.820 --> 02:07:58.130
<v Speaker 12>and kind of connecting with the intro </v>
<v Speaker 12>scene was in the lion king and,</v>

2280
02:07:58.180 --> 02:07:59.830
<v Speaker 12>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 12>the idea of archetypes.</v>

2281
02:08:00.250 --> 02:08:02.380
<v Speaker 12>And when I started understanding what </v>
<v Speaker 12>you were saying,</v>

2282
02:08:02.710 --> 02:08:03.543
<v Speaker 12>I had this unbelievable feeling in my </v>
<v Speaker 12>stomach and my whole body is just his </v>

2283
02:08:07.531 --> 02:08:11.320
<v Speaker 12>smile like this,</v>
<v Speaker 12>like this very intense feeling.</v>

2284
02:08:11.740 --> 02:08:13.480
<v Speaker 12>So warning,</v>
<v Speaker 12>never to read you.</v>

2285
02:08:13.940 --> 02:08:15.760
<v Speaker 12>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I started with ion.</v>

2286
02:08:15.761 --> 02:08:17.620
<v Speaker 12>So that's not a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 12>So</v>

2287
02:08:19.300 --> 02:08:22.180
<v Speaker 12>it was just as powerful feeling and I,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I got so emotional,</v>

2288
02:08:22.210 --> 02:08:25.810
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>and ask thinking about how to articulate</v>

2289
02:08:25.811 --> 02:08:27.070
<v Speaker 12>this question to you a few minutes ago.</v>

2290
02:08:27.070 --> 02:08:29.220
<v Speaker 12>I was just getting so emotional.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It was,</v>

2291
02:08:29.290 --> 02:08:31.210
<v Speaker 12>it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 12>it just seems like,</v>

2292
02:08:31.710 --> 02:08:33.040
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>it scared the hell out of me,</v>

2293
02:08:33.041 --> 02:08:36.310
<v Speaker 12>that feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 12>But it was also a really meaningful,</v>

2294
02:08:36.311 --> 02:08:39.160
<v Speaker 12>so valuable,</v>
<v Speaker 12>amazing feeling and I thought,</v>

2295
02:08:39.640 --> 02:08:40.473
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>it's Kinda like what maybe what God is </v>

2296
02:08:42.641 --> 02:08:43.474
<v Speaker 12>or,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know.</v>

2297
02:08:44.310 --> 02:08:45.490
<v Speaker 12>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 12>it was just so,</v>

2298
02:08:45.491 --> 02:08:49.660
<v Speaker 12>and I usually get that feeling to have </v>
<v Speaker 12>have after listening to it like a band,</v>

2299
02:08:49.661 --> 02:08:54.210
<v Speaker 12>like the Cro mags of black flag,</v>
<v Speaker 12>arunos hardcore bands like that.</v>

2300
02:08:54.670 --> 02:08:56.470
<v Speaker 12>Music is so important to me like that.</v>
<v Speaker 12>And,</v>

2301
02:08:56.850 --> 02:08:57.683
<v Speaker 12>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 12>it's levels of reality that is stacking </v>

2302
02:09:00.070 --> 02:09:03.940
<v Speaker 12>on top of it.</v>
<v Speaker 12>And it just a question that just made me</v>

2303
02:09:03.941 --> 02:09:06.640
<v Speaker 12>so emotional too is like,</v>
<v Speaker 12>what could my life be,</v>

2304
02:09:06.670 --> 02:09:08.570
<v Speaker 12>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 12>And that was something that I,</v>

2305
02:09:08.580 --> 02:09:10.420
<v Speaker 12>I just found myself asking myself,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

2306
02:09:10.430 --> 02:09:12.010
<v Speaker 12>just what.</v>
<v Speaker 12>And I just,</v>

2307
02:09:12.011 --> 02:09:12.844
<v Speaker 12>I wonder if you could give me some,</v>
<v Speaker 12>some extra stuff on that without really </v>

2308
02:09:16.270 --> 02:09:17.140
<v Speaker 12>was,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know.</v>

2309
02:09:18.160 --> 02:09:18.461
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2310
02:09:18.461 --> 02:09:19.294
<v Speaker 4>you've gotTa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've gotta be very careful when </v>

2311
02:09:20.321 --> 02:09:22.480
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're doing something like reading</v>

2312
02:09:22.481 --> 02:09:23.314
<v Speaker 4>young because he'll reorganize your </v>
<v Speaker 4>cognitive structures and that's there's </v>

2313
02:09:30.310 --> 02:09:32.530
<v Speaker 4>deaths and rebirths that go along with </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2314
02:09:33.010 --> 02:09:36.880
<v Speaker 4>You know there's what you're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>do in part is to,</v>

2315
02:09:37.750 --> 02:09:38.583
<v Speaker 4>in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as you're trying to bring what you do </v>

2316
02:09:40.840 --> 02:09:45.840
<v Speaker 4>and how you imagine yourself and how you</v>
<v Speaker 4>articulate yourself into alignment.</v>

2317
02:09:46.570 --> 02:09:47.403
<v Speaker 4>So those three things are the same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very hard because there's more to </v>

2318
02:09:50.261 --> 02:09:51.094
<v Speaker 4>you in your auction than there is in </v>
<v Speaker 4>your articulation and there's more to </v>

2319
02:09:54.161 --> 02:09:54.994
<v Speaker 4>you in your auction than there is in </v>
<v Speaker 4>your imagination and so partly what </v>

2320
02:09:58.331 --> 02:09:59.164
<v Speaker 4>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What you're experiencing is an expanded </v>

2321
02:10:02.141 --> 02:10:06.130
<v Speaker 4>sense of self and possibility and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>might think,</v>

2322
02:10:06.131 --> 02:10:07.330
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a wonderful thing,</v>

2323
02:10:07.331 --> 02:10:11.350
<v Speaker 4>but it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's also a very daunting thing and it.</v>

2324
02:10:11.590 --> 02:10:12.423
<v Speaker 4>It can be a very dangerous thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I was dealing with all of this </v>

2325
02:10:15.881 --> 02:10:18.070
<v Speaker 4>material,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I was writing my first book,</v>

2326
02:10:18.580 --> 02:10:19.413
<v Speaker 4>I had to abandoned a lot of the things </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I was doing that were bad habits </v>

2327
02:10:23.530 --> 02:10:24.363
<v Speaker 4>because it was so stressful to move </v>
<v Speaker 4>through these systems of ideas that I </v>

2328
02:10:29.921 --> 02:10:33.160
<v Speaker 4>couldn't afford any additional mental </v>
<v Speaker 4>energy being wasted.</v>

2329
02:10:33.410 --> 02:10:33.980
<v Speaker 4>Things I was</v>

2330
02:10:33.980 --> 02:10:36.200
<v Speaker 5>doing that wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that weren't together.</v>

2331
02:10:36.890 --> 02:10:37.723
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

2332
02:10:42.490 --> 02:10:45.660
<v Speaker 9>you got to a prolonged debate,</v>
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

2333
02:10:45.670 --> 02:10:49.520
<v Speaker 9>on twitter with a Bot,</v>
<v Speaker 9>a Bot,</v>

2334
02:10:49.880 --> 02:10:52.500
<v Speaker 9>and then again on March.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>

2335
02:10:52.750 --> 02:10:54.740
<v Speaker 9>it was a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So that wasn't very break,</v>

2336
02:10:54.790 --> 02:10:56.370
<v Speaker 9>wasn't no.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Uh,</v>

2337
02:10:56.590 --> 02:10:57.920
<v Speaker 9>and then again on,</v>
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

2338
02:10:58.070 --> 02:11:00.800
<v Speaker 9>on March ninth actually with Noam </v>
<v Speaker 9>Chomsky,</v>

2339
02:11:01.110 --> 02:11:03.420
<v Speaker 9>a animatronic people bought.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And so,</v>

2340
02:11:03.421 --> 02:11:05.390
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I want to ask you as like the leading</v>

2341
02:11:05.870 --> 02:11:06.703
<v Speaker 5>old,</v>

2342
02:11:08.970 --> 02:11:09.803
<v Speaker 9>so,</v>
<v Speaker 9>um,</v>

2343
02:11:11.280 --> 02:11:12.113
<v Speaker 9>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So,</v>

2344
02:11:12.120 --> 02:11:13.190
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>how,</v>

2345
02:11:13.250 --> 02:11:14.830
<v Speaker 9>how important do you think it is to </v>
<v Speaker 9>like,</v>

2346
02:11:14.890 --> 02:11:17.980
<v Speaker 9>debate these intellectuals and do you </v>
<v Speaker 9>think that you are,</v>

2347
02:11:18.010 --> 02:11:18.843
<v Speaker 9>you want.</v>

2348
02:11:19.810 --> 02:11:21.790
<v Speaker 5>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I always hesitate,</v>

2349
02:11:23.260 --> 02:11:25.930
<v Speaker 5>hesitate to claim victory.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like to,</v>

2350
02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:29.350
<v Speaker 5>to escape without abject defeat is a </v>
<v Speaker 5>pretty good,</v>

2351
02:11:29.740 --> 02:11:32.740
<v Speaker 5>pretty good ambition.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2352
02:11:33.230 --> 02:11:34.063
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and plus I think it's rather improbable </v>

2353
02:11:36.731 --> 02:11:38.780
<v Speaker 5>that I would win a debate with a Bot.</v>

2354
02:11:39.480 --> 02:11:40.313
<v Speaker 9>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 9>So some people thought it was pretty </v>

2355
02:11:40.761 --> 02:11:45.761
<v Speaker 9>close.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Twitter is a weird platform,</v>

2356
02:11:47.520 --> 02:11:48.290
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's,</v>

2357
02:11:48.290 --> 02:11:49.430
<v Speaker 9>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's complicated,</v>

2358
02:11:49.870 --> 02:11:50.470
<v Speaker 9>complicated</v>

2359
02:11:50.470 --> 02:11:51.303
<v Speaker 5>platform and I've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've modified my approach to twitter in </v>

2360
02:11:55.391 --> 02:11:56.224
<v Speaker 5>the last month and half I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been trying to selectively retweet </v>

2361
02:12:03.400 --> 02:12:04.233
<v Speaker 5>information.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I pulled a bunch of people and asked </v>

2362
02:12:06.161 --> 02:12:09.130
<v Speaker 5>them if they knew of credible twitter </v>
<v Speaker 5>sources that we're producing</v>

2363
02:12:10.690 --> 02:12:11.523
<v Speaker 5>valid good news.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I found a bunch of sites that were </v>

2364
02:12:15.791 --> 02:12:19.480
<v Speaker 5>doing that and then winnow them down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really like human progress.org,</v>

2365
02:12:20.260 --> 02:12:22.630
<v Speaker 5>which has done a lovely job of </v>
<v Speaker 5>detailing.</v>

2366
02:12:23.020 --> 02:12:23.853
<v Speaker 5>Well they had a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they had a great tweet the other day I </v>

2367
02:12:25.361 --> 02:12:26.194
<v Speaker 5>really loved.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was a mock up of a New York Times </v>

2368
02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:33.000
<v Speaker 5>cover and it said 127,000 people lifted </v>
<v Speaker 5>out of abject poverty today,</v>

2369
02:12:33.581 --> 02:12:35.470
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in like large type.</v>

2370
02:12:35.950 --> 02:12:36.783
<v Speaker 5>And then the tweet was we could have run</v>
<v Speaker 5>this every single day for the last 20 </v>

2371
02:12:40.211 --> 02:12:41.710
<v Speaker 5>years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

2372
02:12:42.130 --> 02:12:44.290
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because some of you know,</v>

2373
02:12:44.291 --> 02:12:45.124
<v Speaker 5>but perhaps some of you don't that </v>
<v Speaker 5>between the year 2000 and 2012 and this </v>

2374
02:12:49.541 --> 02:12:50.560
<v Speaker 5>hasn't stopped yet.</v>

2375
02:12:50.920 --> 02:12:54.970
<v Speaker 5>The number of people in abject poverty </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the world fell by my half,</v>

2376
02:12:55.300 --> 02:12:57.520
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was the most rapid period of economic</v>

2377
02:12:57.521 --> 02:12:59.410
<v Speaker 5>development ever in the history of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>world.</v>

2378
02:12:59.411 --> 02:13:01.450
<v Speaker 5>And there's lots of things like that </v>
<v Speaker 5>happening.</v>

2379
02:13:01.810 --> 02:13:04.990
<v Speaker 5>There's several hundred thousand people </v>
<v Speaker 5>a day being hooked to the power grid,</v>

2380
02:13:05.410 --> 02:13:06.243
<v Speaker 5>which is a big deal for those of you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those of you who have power might also </v>

2381
02:13:09.250 --> 02:13:11.060
<v Speaker 5>appreciate that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2382
02:13:11.920 --> 02:13:13.990
<v Speaker 5>infant mortality has been plummeting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2383
02:13:13.991 --> 02:13:14.824
<v Speaker 5>we're going to plateau in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 5>population at about $9 billion and it's </v>

2384
02:13:17.261 --> 02:13:20.110
<v Speaker 5>going to level off and decline pretty </v>
<v Speaker 5>rapidly after that.</v>

2385
02:13:21.670 --> 02:13:25.340
<v Speaker 5>People are getting access to fresh water</v>
<v Speaker 5>in record numbers like there,</v>

2386
02:13:25.720 --> 02:13:28.480
<v Speaker 5>there's so many good things happening </v>
<v Speaker 5>that it's not even funny and,</v>

2387
02:13:28.890 --> 02:13:29.510
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that we,</v>

2388
02:13:29.510 --> 02:13:33.600
<v Speaker 5>that are real cause for celebration.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so I've been trying to select trying</v>

2389
02:13:33.601 --> 02:13:36.330
<v Speaker 5>to tilt what I've been distributed more </v>
<v Speaker 5>in that direction.</v>

2390
02:13:36.330 --> 02:13:39.660
<v Speaker 5>And I've also put a buffer between me </v>
<v Speaker 5>and my use of twitter.</v>

2391
02:13:40.020 --> 02:13:41.690
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because it,</v>

2392
02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:47.000
<v Speaker 5>it does,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it does reward an impulsivity that isn't</v>

2393
02:13:47.700 --> 02:13:49.630
<v Speaker 5>always,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2394
02:13:49.770 --> 02:13:54.180
<v Speaker 5>let's say my impulsivity that it isn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>always in anyone's best interest.</v>

2395
02:13:54.570 --> 02:13:59.040
<v Speaker 5>I made an agreement with my son too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because he's been watching what I have,</v>

2396
02:13:59.041 --> 02:13:59.874
<v Speaker 5>lots of people watching what I'm doing </v>
<v Speaker 5>and trying to keep me under some degree </v>

2397
02:14:02.761 --> 02:14:03.870
<v Speaker 5>of control,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say,</v>

2398
02:14:04.530 --> 02:14:08.130
<v Speaker 5>and his comment was that if I was going </v>
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>

2399
02:14:08.400 --> 02:14:10.710
<v Speaker 5>if it was serious enough to engage in </v>
<v Speaker 5>twitter,</v>

2400
02:14:10.711 --> 02:14:15.711
<v Speaker 5>combat about it was serious enough to </v>
<v Speaker 5>write a blog post about and so I've kind</v>

2401
02:14:15.761 --> 02:14:16.594
<v Speaker 5>of made this rule which is I'm not going</v>
<v Speaker 5>to comment on anything on twitter and </v>

2402
02:14:20.761 --> 02:14:21.594
<v Speaker 5>that sort of manner unless I feel that </v>
<v Speaker 5>writing about it at some length is </v>

2403
02:14:25.621 --> 02:14:28.440
<v Speaker 5>justifiable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so I started doing that this week.</v>

2404
02:14:28.441 --> 02:14:31.620
<v Speaker 5>I wrote three blog posts and that seems </v>
<v Speaker 5>to have gone pretty well,</v>

2405
02:14:32.070 --> 02:14:35.370
<v Speaker 5>so I hope that answered your question.</v>

2406
02:14:36.520 --> 02:14:37.353
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

2407
02:14:48.790 --> 02:14:49.623
<v Speaker 13>Kind of go on a different topic.</v>
<v Speaker 13>I have a personality psychology </v>

2408
02:14:51.671 --> 02:14:52.720
<v Speaker 13>question.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Okay.</v>

2409
02:14:52.960 --> 02:14:55.060
<v Speaker 13>So when I did the understand myself </v>
<v Speaker 13>quiz,</v>

2410
02:14:55.061 --> 02:14:55.894
<v Speaker 13>I was very surprised to find out that I </v>
<v Speaker 13>was on the bottom two percentile for </v>

2411
02:14:58.421 --> 02:15:01.090
<v Speaker 13>conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 13>which I thought was an openness.</v>

2412
02:15:01.120 --> 02:15:02.980
<v Speaker 13>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 13>you're an entrepreneurial type.</v>

2413
02:15:03.360 --> 02:15:05.780
<v Speaker 13>I'm going to need to partner with </v>
<v Speaker 13>someone whose disciplines</v>

2414
02:15:09.760 --> 02:15:11.130
<v Speaker 13>that's exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 13>See,</v>

2415
02:15:11.340 --> 02:15:12.173
<v Speaker 5>there seems to be a real tension between</v>
<v Speaker 5>openness and especially orderliness was </v>

2416
02:15:17.190 --> 02:15:18.023
<v Speaker 5>open.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People while they think laterally and </v>

2417
02:15:19.731 --> 02:15:20.564
<v Speaker 5>they blow boxes apart and they tend to </v>
<v Speaker 5>make a mess when you're transforming </v>

2418
02:15:22.771 --> 02:15:23.604
<v Speaker 5>things and they're all over the place </v>
<v Speaker 5>and they have to be because otherwise </v>

2419
02:15:26.281 --> 02:15:27.114
<v Speaker 5>they wouldn't be open,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's hard to do that and also be </v>

2420
02:15:29.911 --> 02:15:34.560
<v Speaker 5>orderly and conscientious and so and and</v>
<v Speaker 5>corporation suffer from this tension all</v>

2421
02:15:34.561 --> 02:15:35.161
<v Speaker 5>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2422
02:15:35.161 --> 02:15:35.994
<v Speaker 5>Because they're started by open people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but when they get going and get </v>

2423
02:15:40.231 --> 02:15:42.960
<v Speaker 5>algorithmize they're run by </v>
<v Speaker 5>conscientious people,</v>

2424
02:15:42.990 --> 02:15:43.823
<v Speaker 5>but then the conscientious people can </v>
<v Speaker 5>only go down one track and if the </v>

2425
02:15:45.931 --> 02:15:48.180
<v Speaker 5>environment transforms,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the whole company disappears.</v>

2426
02:15:48.510 --> 02:15:52.230
<v Speaker 5>So I would say you take a look at the </v>
<v Speaker 5>conscientiousness score.</v>

2427
02:15:52.920 --> 02:15:53.753
<v Speaker 5>You see if you can figure out how to </v>
<v Speaker 5>discipline yourself a bit more and see </v>

2428
02:15:56.491 --> 02:15:58.440
<v Speaker 5>if you can figure out how to schedule </v>
<v Speaker 5>your time.</v>

2429
02:15:58.680 --> 02:16:02.370
<v Speaker 5>Not like a prison but like a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a structured set of opportunities.</v>

2430
02:16:02.550 --> 02:16:06.390
<v Speaker 5>And then you understand that in order to</v>
<v Speaker 5>be successful in life,</v>

2431
02:16:06.391 --> 02:16:07.224
<v Speaker 5>likely in the medium to long run,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going to have to find someone </v>

2432
02:16:10.950 --> 02:16:11.783
<v Speaker 5>could be someone close to you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>could be be business partners or </v>

2433
02:16:13.621 --> 02:16:17.790
<v Speaker 5>whatever that fill in that missing </v>
<v Speaker 5>conscientiousness gap.</v>

2434
02:16:18.420 --> 02:16:20.130
<v Speaker 13>So I guess the part B was,</v>
<v Speaker 13>uh,</v>

2435
02:16:20.220 --> 02:16:22.320
<v Speaker 13>my boyfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 13>we've been together for a very long time</v>

2436
02:16:22.321 --> 02:16:23.730
<v Speaker 13>and we're not that old,</v>
<v Speaker 13>uh,</v>

2437
02:16:23.731 --> 02:16:24.564
<v Speaker 13>is also very high in neuroticism.</v>
<v Speaker 13>And I feel that's where like our </v>

2438
02:16:26.791 --> 02:16:29.130
<v Speaker 13>conflict comes.</v>
<v Speaker 13>And as far as longterm,</v>

2439
02:16:29.350 --> 02:16:30.790
<v Speaker 13>what are some things that,</v>
<v Speaker 13>you know,</v>

2440
02:16:31.090 --> 02:16:33.270
<v Speaker 13>lowly,</v>
<v Speaker 13>conscientious and highly neurotic.</v>

2441
02:16:33.320 --> 02:16:38.320
<v Speaker 13>So</v>
<v Speaker 13>we'll look into that.</v>

2442
02:16:42.500 --> 02:16:43.333
<v Speaker 5>I mean the simple,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can only high levels of neuroticism </v>

2443
02:16:48.650 --> 02:16:53.650
<v Speaker 5>are problematic interrelationship.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's probably why 75 percent of divorces</v>

2444
02:16:54.411 --> 02:16:58.130
<v Speaker 5>are initiated by women because women are</v>
<v Speaker 5>higher in neuroticism.</v>

2445
02:16:58.131 --> 02:16:58.964
<v Speaker 5>That meant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think the reason for that is that </v>

2446
02:17:00.441 --> 02:17:03.020
<v Speaker 5>they have to be more sensitive to infant</v>
<v Speaker 5>distress.</v>

2447
02:17:03.410 --> 02:17:06.080
<v Speaker 5>And so that makes them more sensitive to</v>
<v Speaker 5>distress in general.</v>

2448
02:17:06.230 --> 02:17:07.063
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know that for sure it's a </v>

2449
02:17:08.330 --> 02:17:09.163
<v Speaker 5>supposition,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but high levels of neuroticism do tend </v>

2450
02:17:11.361 --> 02:17:12.194
<v Speaker 5>to make a relationship volatiles and and</v>
<v Speaker 5>and to put a fair bit of negative </v>

2451
02:17:15.531 --> 02:17:18.680
<v Speaker 5>emotion into it and the question is </v>
<v Speaker 5>where,</v>

2452
02:17:18.790 --> 02:17:21.680
<v Speaker 5>what the source of the high level of </v>
<v Speaker 5>neuroticism is.</v>

2453
02:17:21.740 --> 02:17:22.573
<v Speaker 5>It might be purely temperamental,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it also might be indicative of an </v>

2454
02:17:24.801 --> 02:17:27.110
<v Speaker 5>underlying anxiety disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 5>depression or,</v>

2455
02:17:27.290 --> 02:17:28.123
<v Speaker 5>or a physiological problem because they </v>
<v Speaker 5>can manifest themselves in high levels </v>

2456
02:17:31.311 --> 02:17:32.144
<v Speaker 5>of negative emotion and so there's </v>
<v Speaker 5>always the possibility of doing </v>

2457
02:17:35.271 --> 02:17:36.104
<v Speaker 5>something about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What I usually tell my clients who are </v>

2458
02:17:38.211 --> 02:17:40.520
<v Speaker 5>high in neuroticism is two simple </v>
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>

2459
02:17:40.850 --> 02:17:44.150
<v Speaker 5>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>get up at the same time in the morning.</v>

2460
02:17:44.760 --> 02:17:45.593
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because that helps stabilize your </v>

2461
02:17:46.461 --> 02:17:48.380
<v Speaker 5>circadian rhythms.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Number two,</v>

2462
02:17:48.710 --> 02:17:49.543
<v Speaker 5>eat a large meal before you stress </v>
<v Speaker 5>yourself in the morning and mostly </v>

2463
02:17:53.211 --> 02:17:54.044
<v Speaker 5>protein and fat based because if you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>high in neuroticism and you stress </v>

2464
02:17:58.071 --> 02:18:01.370
<v Speaker 5>yourself before you eat you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you disregulate your,</v>

2465
02:18:01.820 --> 02:18:04.430
<v Speaker 5>your emotional reaction systems </v>
<v Speaker 5>essentially,</v>

2466
02:18:04.610 --> 02:18:06.950
<v Speaker 5>and you can't reregulate them until you </v>
<v Speaker 5>sleep again.</v>

2467
02:18:07.880 --> 02:18:11.420
<v Speaker 5>So other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>goodwill and understanding is about what</v>

2468
02:18:11.421 --> 02:18:12.254
<v Speaker 5>you've got</v>

2469
02:18:15.550 --> 02:18:17.310
<v Speaker 13>doing tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Dr Pearson.</v>

2470
02:18:18.680 --> 02:18:22.560
<v Speaker 13>Pretty good question.</v>
<v Speaker 13>So on the brutal side,</v>

2471
02:18:22.561 --> 02:18:23.394
<v Speaker 13>I might say,</v>
<v Speaker 13>but nervous to talk in front of you </v>

2472
02:18:26.581 --> 02:18:27.414
<v Speaker 13>because you've got to be one of the most</v>
<v Speaker 13>formidable people that I've ever heard </v>

2473
02:18:29.911 --> 02:18:33.750
<v Speaker 13>of or ever listened to every scene.</v>
<v Speaker 13>So my question is,</v>

2474
02:18:34.110 --> 02:18:34.943
<v Speaker 13>again,</v>
<v Speaker 13>you're one of the best communicators </v>

2475
02:18:35.821 --> 02:18:40.821
<v Speaker 13>that I've ever listened to.</v>
<v Speaker 13>If I could be half as good at you are at</v>

2476
02:18:42.421 --> 02:18:45.240
<v Speaker 13>communicating as you are,</v>
<v Speaker 13>I would be set.</v>

2477
02:18:45.450 --> 02:18:48.240
<v Speaker 13>How can I teach myself to do that </v>
<v Speaker 13>practice?</v>

2478
02:18:49.520 --> 02:18:50.630
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really like,</v>

2479
02:18:51.410 --> 02:18:56.060
<v Speaker 5>well there's a couple of things is helps</v>
<v Speaker 5>to read a lot.</v>

2480
02:18:57.230 --> 02:18:58.820
<v Speaker 5>It really helps to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2481
02:18:59.990 --> 02:19:02.990
<v Speaker 5>So if you want to make yourself </v>
<v Speaker 5>articulate,</v>

2482
02:19:03.920 --> 02:19:08.600
<v Speaker 5>which is a very good idea,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then not only should you read,</v>

2483
02:19:08.601 --> 02:19:10.910
<v Speaker 5>but you should write down what you </v>
<v Speaker 5>think.</v>

2484
02:19:11.960 --> 02:19:14.030
<v Speaker 5>And if you can do that a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 5>every day,</v>

2485
02:19:14.720 --> 02:19:15.553
<v Speaker 5>15 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe you could steal 15 minutes and do </v>

2486
02:19:18.051 --> 02:19:21.080
<v Speaker 5>it every day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if you do that for 10 years,</v>

2487
02:19:21.380 --> 02:19:25.220
<v Speaker 5>you really straightened out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're thinking if you're going to speak</v>

2488
02:19:26.240 --> 02:19:27.073
<v Speaker 5>effectively,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to know way more than you're </v>

2489
02:19:30.021 --> 02:19:31.130
<v Speaker 5>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

2490
02:19:31.160 --> 02:19:31.993
<v Speaker 5>So if you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is often difficult for beginning </v>

2491
02:19:33.681 --> 02:19:36.260
<v Speaker 5>lectures at university because they'll </v>
<v Speaker 5>do a lecture on a topic,</v>

2492
02:19:36.261 --> 02:19:37.094
<v Speaker 5>but they only know as much as they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>saying in the lecture and they get kind </v>

2493
02:19:39.771 --> 02:19:43.940
<v Speaker 5>of stuck to their notes because of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you want to know 10 times as much as</v>

2494
02:19:43.941 --> 02:19:44.774
<v Speaker 5>you are saying in the lecture and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>you can specify a stepping path through </v>

2495
02:19:49.101 --> 02:19:51.770
<v Speaker 5>it and elaborate with the other things </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you know.</v>

2496
02:19:51.770 --> 02:19:53.750
<v Speaker 5>But to do that you have to do a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 5>reading,</v>

2497
02:19:54.140 --> 02:19:57.410
<v Speaker 5>but you also have to do a lot of reading</v>
<v Speaker 5>because that's where the synthesize,</v>

2498
02:19:57.530 --> 02:20:01.850
<v Speaker 5>that's where the synthesizing comes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's on the input side.</v>

2499
02:20:01.851 --> 02:20:04.820
<v Speaker 5>And then on the output side,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well there's some tricks.</v>

2500
02:20:05.240 --> 02:20:08.630
<v Speaker 5>Techniques let's say is like if you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>speaking in front of a group,</v>

2501
02:20:08.860 --> 02:20:12.290
<v Speaker 5>you are not delivering a talk to a </v>
<v Speaker 5>group.</v>

2502
02:20:13.250 --> 02:20:16.190
<v Speaker 5>That's not what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The talk isn't a packaged thing that you</v>

2503
02:20:16.580 --> 02:20:18.950
<v Speaker 5>present to a group.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There isn't a group,</v>

2504
02:20:20.090 --> 02:20:22.970
<v Speaker 5>there's a bunch of individuals and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>talk to them.</v>

2505
02:20:23.210 --> 02:20:24.043
<v Speaker 5>So when I talked to a group,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I always talk to people one at a time </v>

2506
02:20:26.930 --> 02:20:29.840
<v Speaker 5>and that makes it easier too because you</v>
<v Speaker 5>know how to talk to a person.</v>

2507
02:20:30.240 --> 02:20:31.820
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>can you talk to a thousand people?</v>

2508
02:20:31.821 --> 02:20:33.830
<v Speaker 5>Well probably not because it's too </v>
<v Speaker 5>intimidating,</v>

2509
02:20:34.160 --> 02:20:36.140
<v Speaker 5>but there isn't a thousand people there.</v>

2510
02:20:36.590 --> 02:20:37.423
<v Speaker 5>There's thousand individuals and so you </v>
<v Speaker 5>just look at an individual and you say </v>

2511
02:20:41.511 --> 02:20:44.570
<v Speaker 5>something and you can tell if they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>engaged,</v>

2512
02:20:45.290 --> 02:20:46.123
<v Speaker 5>they look confused or they look </v>
<v Speaker 5>interested or they look angry or they </v>

2513
02:20:48.561 --> 02:20:49.394
<v Speaker 5>look bored or maybe they're asleep,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in which case you look at someone else </v>

2514
02:20:52.880 --> 02:20:55.370
<v Speaker 5>and they give you feedback about how </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're doing.</v>

2515
02:20:55.371 --> 02:20:59.180
<v Speaker 5>And so one thing is to have something to</v>
<v Speaker 5>say.</v>

2516
02:20:59.540 --> 02:21:00.373
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the next thing is pay attention to who </v>

2517
02:21:02.421 --> 02:21:03.254
<v Speaker 5>you're talking to because unless you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>very badly socialized and that seems </v>

2518
02:21:07.641 --> 02:21:08.474
<v Speaker 5>unlikely in your case because you know </v>
<v Speaker 5>you present yourself at least </v>

2519
02:21:11.031 --> 02:21:11.930
<v Speaker 5>moderately.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2520
02:21:11.931 --> 02:21:13.970
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and well,</v>

2521
02:21:13.971 --> 02:21:15.860
<v Speaker 5>I mean I don't know you very well but in</v>
<v Speaker 5>first,</v>

2522
02:21:15.861 --> 02:21:18.430
<v Speaker 5>but on first sight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know you're,</v>

2523
02:21:18.431 --> 02:21:19.264
<v Speaker 5>you're doing fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the probability that if you pay </v>

2524
02:21:20.841 --> 02:21:23.810
<v Speaker 5>attention to the individuals that you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>talking to,</v>

2525
02:21:24.050 --> 02:21:29.050
<v Speaker 5>that your natural wealth of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of social skill will manifest itself,</v>

2526
02:21:29.631 --> 02:21:30.464
<v Speaker 5>is extremely high,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so you don't deliver a talk to an </v>

2527
02:21:33.921 --> 02:21:34.754
<v Speaker 5>audience.</v>

2528
02:21:34.940 --> 02:21:36.420
<v Speaker 5>That's a really bad way of thinking </v>
<v Speaker 5>about it.</v>

2529
02:21:36.421 --> 02:21:38.870
<v Speaker 5>You're actually engaged in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>conversation with an audience,</v>

2530
02:21:38.871 --> 02:21:39.704
<v Speaker 5>even if they're not talking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're nodding and shifting position </v>

2531
02:21:43.551 --> 02:21:46.030
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>looking like this or,</v>

2532
02:21:46.580 --> 02:21:48.820
<v Speaker 5>and you can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can pull that in and,</v>

2533
02:21:48.830 --> 02:21:49.663
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and use it to govern the level at which </v>

2534
02:21:52.551 --> 02:21:55.460
<v Speaker 5>you're addressing the entire audience.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

2535
02:21:57.140 --> 02:22:00.980
<v Speaker 5>the last thing I would say as well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>having the aim to be a good communicator</v>

2536
02:22:00.981 --> 02:22:02.270
<v Speaker 5>is a good start.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you think,</v>

2537
02:22:02.271 --> 02:22:03.104
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can buttress that to some degree are </v>

2538
02:22:06.350 --> 02:22:07.183
<v Speaker 5>there isn't anything that you can boss.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is the whole point of a liberal </v>

2539
02:22:09.501 --> 02:22:10.334
<v Speaker 5>education.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There isn't anything that you can </v>

2540
02:22:11.751 --> 02:22:16.751
<v Speaker 5>possibly do that makes you more </v>
<v Speaker 5>competent in everything you do.</v>

2541
02:22:17.600 --> 02:22:18.433
<v Speaker 5>Then to learn how to communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't care if you're going to be a </v>

2542
02:22:20.211 --> 02:22:21.044
<v Speaker 5>carpenter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean being a carpenter by the way is </v>

2543
02:22:22.131 --> 02:22:24.110
<v Speaker 5>very difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially if you're a good carpenter.</v>

2544
02:22:24.110 --> 02:22:27.090
<v Speaker 5>But if you're good at communicating as a</v>
<v Speaker 5>carpenter,</v>

2545
02:22:27.091 --> 02:22:31.470
<v Speaker 5>you're like 10 times better as a carpet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the,</v>

2546
02:22:31.590 --> 02:22:34.770
<v Speaker 5>and this is something that the liberal </v>
<v Speaker 5>arts colleges,</v>

2547
02:22:34.830 --> 02:22:36.970
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if they've forgotten it,</v>

2548
02:22:36.971 --> 02:22:38.760
<v Speaker 5>but they don't do a very good job of </v>
<v Speaker 5>marketing.</v>

2549
02:22:38.761 --> 02:22:39.121
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2550
02:22:39.121 --> 02:22:42.030
<v Speaker 5>what's the use of a bachelor's degree in</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bachelor of arts?</v>

2551
02:22:42.031 --> 02:22:42.864
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2552
02:22:43.470 --> 02:22:45.480
<v Speaker 5>you can think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can write,</v>

2553
02:22:46.080 --> 02:22:48.480
<v Speaker 5>you can speak.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You've read something.</v>

2554
02:22:48.990 --> 02:22:52.890
<v Speaker 5>It's like the economic value that is </v>
<v Speaker 5>incalculable.</v>

2555
02:22:53.370 --> 02:22:54.203
<v Speaker 5>The people that I've watched in my life </v>
<v Speaker 5>who've been spectacularly successful </v>

2556
02:22:58.080 --> 02:23:00.030
<v Speaker 5>are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have skills.</v>

2557
02:23:00.750 --> 02:23:05.750
<v Speaker 5>Clearly that's a minimum precondition,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they're also very,</v>

2558
02:23:05.971 --> 02:23:06.804
<v Speaker 5>very good at articulating the shells.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so whenever they negotiate their </v>

2559
02:23:10.381 --> 02:23:11.214
<v Speaker 5>successful well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's kind of like the definition of </v>

2560
02:23:13.381 --> 02:23:14.490
<v Speaker 5>success in life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2561
02:23:14.640 --> 02:23:15.473
<v Speaker 5>You negotiate and you're six.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't mean you win because if </v>

2562
02:23:17.491 --> 02:23:20.280
<v Speaker 5>you're a good negotiator,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're really good negotiator,</v>

2563
02:23:20.700 --> 02:23:21.533
<v Speaker 5>everybody walks away from the </v>
<v Speaker 5>negotiation derailed and so then people </v>

2564
02:23:25.561 --> 02:23:28.290
<v Speaker 5>line up to do things with you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So.</v>

2565
02:23:28.291 --> 02:23:29.124
<v Speaker 5>And that's all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's all dependent on your ability to </v>

2566
02:23:30.631 --> 02:23:33.120
<v Speaker 5>communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So practice.</v>

2567
02:23:34.080 --> 02:23:34.913
<v Speaker 5>Thank you very much.</v>

2568
02:23:48.840 --> 02:23:49.410
<v Speaker 13>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 13>thanks.</v>

2569
02:23:49.410 --> 02:23:50.243
<v Speaker 13>Sorry I have.</v>
<v Speaker 13>There's a section of the book in here </v>

2570
02:23:52.141 --> 02:23:57.141
<v Speaker 13>that I just want to talk about here.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Confident young man.</v>

2571
02:23:58.770 --> 02:23:59.603
<v Speaker 13>Rule 11 of this book here.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Don't bother children when you're </v>

2572
02:24:03.250 --> 02:24:04.110
<v Speaker 13>skateboarding.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Well,</v>

2573
02:24:04.170 --> 02:24:05.003
<v Speaker 13>the small bone to pick with Lafayette </v>
<v Speaker 13>college is that my brother does get </v>

2574
02:24:07.111 --> 02:24:07.944
<v Speaker 13>stopped skateboarding here,</v>
<v Speaker 13>but that's not the surprise of my </v>

2575
02:24:09.661 --> 02:24:11.400
<v Speaker 13>questions today.</v>
<v Speaker 13>I'm really.</v>

2576
02:24:11.401 --> 02:24:12.234
<v Speaker 13>I have two key questions.</v>
<v Speaker 13>You said in one lecture that Alexander </v>

2577
02:24:15.390 --> 02:24:16.223
<v Speaker 13>Soldier nation basically memorize the </v>
<v Speaker 13>other work to bring it out and to show </v>

2578
02:24:19.171 --> 02:24:20.004
<v Speaker 13>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 13>but I've had professors who started to </v>

2579
02:24:21.391 --> 02:24:25.320
<v Speaker 13>be in ones that are very studied on </v>
<v Speaker 13>Slavic Culture and studied on the Gulag.</v>

2580
02:24:25.350 --> 02:24:28.110
<v Speaker 13>Tell me essentially that he was a kgb </v>
<v Speaker 13>agent.</v>

2581
02:24:28.320 --> 02:24:29.790
<v Speaker 13>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 13>would you agree with that statement that</v>

2582
02:24:29.791 --> 02:24:30.624
<v Speaker 13>the only way that he would have been </v>
<v Speaker 13>able to get all that stuff out of their </v>

2583
02:24:32.180 --> 02:24:36.450
<v Speaker 13>live in there for 20 years and not die </v>
<v Speaker 13>or starve to death was from that?</v>

2584
02:24:37.030 --> 02:24:39.660
<v Speaker 13>What do you don't really have anything </v>
<v Speaker 13>to say about that?</v>

2585
02:24:39.760 --> 02:24:41.340
<v Speaker 13>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 13>anything's possible,</v>

2586
02:24:41.341 --> 02:24:46.260
<v Speaker 13>but probably not that.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Probably not that KGB agent like I don't</v>

2587
02:24:46.261 --> 02:24:49.320
<v Speaker 13>know why anyone would tell you that.</v>
<v Speaker 13>What's your evidence for that?</v>

2588
02:24:49.590 --> 02:24:51.900
<v Speaker 13>It's an impossible for him to have </v>
<v Speaker 13>documented that.</v>

2589
02:24:52.200 --> 02:24:55.550
<v Speaker 13>That must've been a kgb agent,</v>
<v Speaker 13>like memorize all of that.</v>

2590
02:24:55.570 --> 02:24:56.403
<v Speaker 13>Getting out of prison</v>
<v Speaker 13>was your writing in prison and he </v>

2591
02:25:00.690 --> 02:25:03.630
<v Speaker 13>couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 13>He couldn't have done anything.</v>

2592
02:25:04.440 --> 02:25:07.560
<v Speaker 13>You'd be amazed at what people can </v>
<v Speaker 13>remember when they have to remember.</v>

2593
02:25:08.270 --> 02:25:12.470
<v Speaker 13>So people remember very large volumes of</v>
<v Speaker 13>material when they're,</v>

2594
02:25:12.750 --> 02:25:15.930
<v Speaker 13>when that's what they have.</v>
<v Speaker 13>I get like preliterate people.</v>

2595
02:25:15.990 --> 02:25:16.823
<v Speaker 13>No.</v>
<v Speaker 13>All they did was remember I have a </v>

2596
02:25:18.691 --> 02:25:21.000
<v Speaker 13>friend who's not literate and what he </v>
<v Speaker 13>can.</v>

2597
02:25:21.180 --> 02:25:23.040
<v Speaker 13>I have two friends that aren't really </v>
<v Speaker 13>very literate.</v>

2598
02:25:23.200 --> 02:25:24.160
<v Speaker 13>One of them is really not</v>

2599
02:25:24.160 --> 02:25:28.600
<v Speaker 5>literate and what he can remember,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you just can't believe are modern people</v>

2600
02:25:28.601 --> 02:25:30.640
<v Speaker 5>don't remember much because we don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>have to.</v>

2601
02:25:30.641 --> 02:25:34.560
<v Speaker 5>We write it down and externalize it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but our capacity for memory is,</v>

2602
02:25:34.620 --> 02:25:35.453
<v Speaker 5>is far greater than you realize the </v>
<v Speaker 5>shake from when the Greeks switch from </v>

2603
02:25:38.861 --> 02:25:40.840
<v Speaker 5>an oral culture to a literary culture </v>
<v Speaker 5>was very fascinating.</v>

2604
02:25:41.020 --> 02:25:43.160
<v Speaker 5>But my second question before I go sit </v>
<v Speaker 5>back down with,</v>

2605
02:25:43.170 --> 02:25:44.940
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how do you feel about the influence of,</v>

2606
02:25:44.941 --> 02:25:45.470
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I,</v>

2607
02:25:45.470 --> 02:25:46.303
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with reading Terence Mckenna and things </v>

2608
02:25:46.931 --> 02:25:47.764
<v Speaker 5>along these lines,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the humans of psychedelics within our </v>

2609
02:25:48.971 --> 02:25:52.510
<v Speaker 5>culture and how that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and what that does to the human psyche.</v>

2610
02:25:52.511 --> 02:25:54.550
<v Speaker 5>I know that the guy who,</v>
<v Speaker 5>God only knows,</v>

2611
02:25:56.860 --> 02:25:57.693
<v Speaker 5>I don't think we understand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We don't understand psychedelics one </v>

2612
02:26:00.751 --> 02:26:02.780
<v Speaker 5>bit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so</v>

2613
02:26:04.280 --> 02:26:06.720
<v Speaker 5>I don't think we understand that forest,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

2614
02:26:07.430 --> 02:26:08.263
<v Speaker 5>what would you play the role that </v>
<v Speaker 5>they've played in our religious and </v>

2615
02:26:10.701 --> 02:26:11.534
<v Speaker 5>cognitive evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we don't understand that they're an </v>

2616
02:26:15.860 --> 02:26:18.500
<v Speaker 5>absolute mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

2617
02:26:21.050 --> 02:26:25.390
<v Speaker 5>play with them at your peril.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Acid.</v>

2618
02:26:28.100 --> 02:26:28.933
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2619
02:26:29.150 --> 02:26:29.983
<v Speaker 5>Swiss,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a pretty strange place for that emerged </v>

2620
02:26:31.880 --> 02:26:33.520
<v Speaker 5>from.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>

2621
02:26:35.160 --> 02:26:38.710
<v Speaker 5>reference the chairs and for random </v>
<v Speaker 5>audience members.</v>

2622
02:26:38.730 --> 02:26:39.563
<v Speaker 5>The sentence</v>

2623
02:26:46.170 --> 02:26:49.010
<v Speaker 9>in a lot of your talks,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you speak about the things that the west</v>

2624
02:26:49.020 --> 02:26:49.853
<v Speaker 9>you'd correct.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And I'm curious yourself being a </v>

2625
02:26:51.631 --> 02:26:55.020
<v Speaker 9>psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 9>what your thoughts are on Edward Bernays</v>

2626
02:26:55.021 --> 02:26:57.120
<v Speaker 9>and the impact that he had on Western </v>
<v Speaker 9>society.</v>

2627
02:26:57.240 --> 02:26:58.073
<v Speaker 9>The,</v>
<v Speaker 9>um,</v>

2628
02:26:59.220 --> 02:27:00.053
<v Speaker 9>the guiding of masses are controlling </v>
<v Speaker 9>them and being able to take control in </v>

2629
02:27:04.381 --> 02:27:05.214
<v Speaker 9>that way.</v>

2630
02:27:05.320 --> 02:27:06.960
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know enough about them.</v>

2631
02:27:06.961 --> 02:27:09.040
<v Speaker 5>I'm afraid to give you an intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 5>answer.</v>

2632
02:27:09.670 --> 02:27:10.503
<v Speaker 5>So do you have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you have another question because </v>

2633
02:27:12.641 --> 02:27:14.470
<v Speaker 5>that's rather disappointed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I imagine</v>

2634
02:27:14.990 --> 02:27:16.230
<v Speaker 9>a shared.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>

2635
02:27:16.580 --> 02:27:18.500
<v Speaker 9>my other question would be that,</v>
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

2636
02:27:18.600 --> 02:27:19.433
<v Speaker 9>to my understanding that work control </v>
<v Speaker 9>and people's control is instrumental in </v>

2637
02:27:24.700 --> 02:27:25.533
<v Speaker 9>the idea of socialism and if these </v>
<v Speaker 9>countries that we call socialist and </v>

2638
02:27:29.621 --> 02:27:33.760
<v Speaker 9>communist are totalitarian states ruled </v>
<v Speaker 9>by a single party or a single man,</v>

2639
02:27:35.830 --> 02:27:38.110
<v Speaker 9>why do we continue referring to them as </v>
<v Speaker 9>such</v>

2640
02:27:39.100 --> 02:27:41.250
<v Speaker 5>as referring them to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as,</v>

2641
02:27:41.360 --> 02:27:45.530
<v Speaker 9>as socialists,</v>
<v Speaker 9>as when they don't follow the main heart</v>

2642
02:27:45.531 --> 02:27:46.150
<v Speaker 9>of it?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

2643
02:27:46.150 --> 02:27:48.970
<v Speaker 5>Good or control?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a good question.</v>

2644
02:27:49.200 --> 02:27:51.220
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't really know the answer to that.</v>

2645
02:27:51.730 --> 02:27:54.400
<v Speaker 5>It looks like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who knows,</v>

2646
02:27:54.401 --> 02:27:55.120
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe,</v>

2647
02:27:55.120 --> 02:27:55.953
<v Speaker 5>maybe the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe the inevitable end product of a </v>

2648
02:27:58.421 --> 02:28:01.780
<v Speaker 5>collectivist view point is something </v>
<v Speaker 5>like a totalitarian state.</v>

2649
02:28:02.380 --> 02:28:03.213
<v Speaker 5>It seems probable because most human </v>
<v Speaker 5>governments have been essentially </v>

2650
02:28:07.660 --> 02:28:10.570
<v Speaker 5>totalitarian states have one degree of </v>
<v Speaker 5>severity or another.</v>

2651
02:28:11.350 --> 02:28:15.970
<v Speaker 5>So the tribal tendency might manifest </v>
<v Speaker 5>itself in a rigid hierarchy,</v>

2652
02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:18.520
<v Speaker 5>but it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is a perverse fact.</v>

2653
02:28:18.570 --> 02:28:19.403
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you think that it's one of the </v>

2654
02:28:20.621 --> 02:28:23.990
<v Speaker 5>mysteries about the continual </v>
<v Speaker 5>apologetics for the radical left.</v>

2655
02:28:23.991 --> 02:28:24.824
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2656
02:28:24.830 --> 02:28:28.550
<v Speaker 5>didn't China just announced that it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>president is now president for life.</v>

2657
02:28:29.190 --> 02:28:31.830
<v Speaker 5>So that's actually a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2658
02:28:32.440 --> 02:28:33.273
<v Speaker 5>and despite the fact that they've moved </v>
<v Speaker 5>quite a distance in the free market </v>

2659
02:28:35.961 --> 02:28:36.794
<v Speaker 5>direction,</v>
<v Speaker 5>obviously that underlying totalitarian </v>

2660
02:28:39.711 --> 02:28:44.450
<v Speaker 5>impulse is still alive then and well and</v>
<v Speaker 5>thriving.</v>

2661
02:28:44.750 --> 02:28:45.583
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and what the Chinese are doing with </v>

2662
02:28:46.470 --> 02:28:49.370
<v Speaker 5>electronic surveillance should make </v>
<v Speaker 5>everyone's hair stand on end.</v>

2663
02:28:50.050 --> 02:28:52.470
<v Speaker 2>So</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2664
02:28:52.670 --> 02:28:57.670
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hi,</v>

2665
02:29:07.240 --> 02:29:12.240
<v Speaker 2>Dr Peterson</v>
<v Speaker 2>to</v>

2666
02:29:15.900 --> 02:29:16.733
<v Speaker 2>Mike Range.</v>

2667
02:29:18.880 --> 02:29:19.713
<v Speaker 14>It's a pleasure to ask you a question.</v>
<v Speaker 14>I wrote it down to minimize </v>

2668
02:29:23.010 --> 02:29:26.340
<v Speaker 14>inarticulate.</v>
<v Speaker 14>So you,</v>

2669
02:29:27.400 --> 02:29:29.950
<v Speaker 14>you put a great emphasis on truth in </v>
<v Speaker 14>your work.</v>

2670
02:29:30.250 --> 02:29:31.083
<v Speaker 14>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 14>so this is your writing in 12 rules for </v>

2671
02:29:32.411 --> 02:29:34.900
<v Speaker 14>life and above all,</v>
<v Speaker 14>don't lie.</v>

2672
02:29:35.380 --> 02:29:38.530
<v Speaker 14>Don't lie about anything ever lying </v>
<v Speaker 14>leads to hell.</v>

2673
02:29:39.100 --> 02:29:39.933
<v Speaker 14>It was the great and the small eyes of </v>
<v Speaker 14>the Nazis and communists states that </v>

2674
02:29:42.461 --> 02:29:44.230
<v Speaker 14>produce the deaths of tens of millions </v>
<v Speaker 14>of people.</v>

2675
02:29:45.990 --> 02:29:46.823
<v Speaker 14>And you've also talked about how niche </v>
<v Speaker 14>of foresaw the nihilism implicit in </v>

2676
02:29:49.931 --> 02:29:52.100
<v Speaker 14>European culture in the 18 hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 14>uh,</v>

2677
02:29:52.180 --> 02:29:53.013
<v Speaker 14>that would likely lead to the </v>
<v Speaker 14>authoritarianism and death tolls </v>

2678
02:29:55.120 --> 02:29:56.800
<v Speaker 14>mentioned at the end of the previous </v>
<v Speaker 14>quote.</v>

2679
02:29:57.280 --> 02:29:58.113
<v Speaker 14>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 14>and I find this interesting for the </v>

2680
02:29:58.811 --> 02:29:59.830
<v Speaker 14>following reason.</v>
<v Speaker 14>Uh,</v>

2681
02:29:59.840 --> 02:30:04.840
<v Speaker 14>so here's Nisha and the will to power </v>
<v Speaker 14>radical nihilism is the conviction of an</v>

2682
02:30:04.991 --> 02:30:08.470
<v Speaker 14>absolute untenable out of existence when</v>
<v Speaker 14>it comes to the highest values.</v>

2683
02:30:08.471 --> 02:30:09.304
<v Speaker 14>One recognizes this realization is a </v>
<v Speaker 14>consequence of the cultivation of </v>

2684
02:30:13.211 --> 02:30:15.610
<v Speaker 14>truthfulness.</v>
<v Speaker 14>So in other words,</v>

2685
02:30:15.630 --> 02:30:17.290
<v Speaker 14>a Nisha saw the,</v>
<v Speaker 14>uh,</v>

2686
02:30:17.460 --> 02:30:20.740
<v Speaker 14>that valuing truth to it's fullest </v>
<v Speaker 14>undercuts valuation itself.</v>

2687
02:30:21.330 --> 02:30:22.163
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He specifically within a Christian </v>

2688
02:30:23.821 --> 02:30:24.900
<v Speaker 5>context,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by the way,</v>

2689
02:30:25.400 --> 02:30:26.490
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the things that,</v>

2690
02:30:26.660 --> 02:30:31.660
<v Speaker 5>that need you in his role as Christian </v>
<v Speaker 5>critic pointed out was that the death of</v>

2691
02:30:33.121 --> 02:30:38.121
<v Speaker 5>God was a consequence in his formulation</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the Christian insistence on truth.</v>

2692
02:30:39.390 --> 02:30:40.223
<v Speaker 5>So his,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his idea was essentially that as </v>

2693
02:30:43.980 --> 02:30:48.870
<v Speaker 5>Christianity elevated the truth to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>position of highest moral virtue,</v>

2694
02:30:48.871 --> 02:30:49.704
<v Speaker 5>and then that truth seeking spirit </v>
<v Speaker 5>develop scientific and rational </v>

2695
02:30:55.531 --> 02:30:59.100
<v Speaker 5>viewpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that the logical consequence of that was</v>

2696
02:30:59.310 --> 02:31:00.143
<v Speaker 5>the turning of the spirit of truth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>On the metaphysical presumptions of </v>

2697
02:31:03.631 --> 02:31:06.510
<v Speaker 5>Christianity itself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's the context for that.</v>

2698
02:31:06.980 --> 02:31:07.750
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

2699
02:31:07.750 --> 02:31:08.583
<v Speaker 14>I wanted to ask you is that you appear </v>
<v Speaker 14>to care deeply about meeting and the </v>

2700
02:31:12.460 --> 02:31:13.293
<v Speaker 14>philosophical problem of nihilism.</v>
<v Speaker 14>So I was just wondering if you could </v>

2701
02:31:15.970 --> 02:31:16.803
<v Speaker 14>elaborate on this tension between </v>
<v Speaker 14>nihilism and truth in light of what </v>

2702
02:31:20.911 --> 02:31:21.744
<v Speaker 14>you're saying and whether there's a way </v>
<v Speaker 14>in which you see your ideas as </v>

2703
02:31:26.881 --> 02:31:27.714
<v Speaker 14>elaborated in your latest book as a </v>
<v Speaker 14>solution to the problem of nihilism or </v>

2704
02:31:32.310 --> 02:31:34.590
<v Speaker 14>how they fit into the broader.</v>
<v Speaker 14>Great question.</v>

2705
02:31:35.330 --> 02:31:36.163
<v Speaker 14>Um,</v>

2706
02:31:36.350 --> 02:31:37.183
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think really the young's work is the </v>

2707
02:31:39.531 --> 02:31:40.364
<v Speaker 5>answer to that question because yoga was</v>
<v Speaker 5>profoundly influenced by Freud </v>

2708
02:31:45.500 --> 02:31:46.333
<v Speaker 5>obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if you read the Freudian </v>

2709
02:31:50.120 --> 02:31:50.953
<v Speaker 5>biographers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say it's easy to conceptualize </v>

2710
02:31:54.261 --> 02:31:59.030
<v Speaker 5>young as an acolyte of Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's not really accurate,</v>

2711
02:31:59.240 --> 02:32:00.073
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't say or it's insufficiently </v>
<v Speaker 5>accurate because Freud had a great </v>

2712
02:32:03.471 --> 02:32:04.304
<v Speaker 5>influence on you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you was also exceptionally </v>

2713
02:32:06.771 --> 02:32:11.771
<v Speaker 5>influenced by niching and you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think you can also view piaget in this</v>

2714
02:32:12.141 --> 02:32:12.974
<v Speaker 5>matter by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>although not directly as a consequence </v>

2715
02:32:14.661 --> 02:32:16.460
<v Speaker 5>of the influence of niche.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It'd be more indirect,</v>

2716
02:32:16.461 --> 02:32:17.294
<v Speaker 5>but young really regarded what he was </v>
<v Speaker 5>doing as an answer to niches question </v>

2717
02:32:23.960 --> 02:32:26.960
<v Speaker 5>and the question is something like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2718
02:32:28.760 --> 02:32:29.593
<v Speaker 5>the inquirer inquiring western rational </v>
<v Speaker 5>mind has murdered the metaphysical </v>

2719
02:32:34.851 --> 02:32:39.851
<v Speaker 5>presuppositions of Western society.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now what now niches idea was,</v>

2720
02:32:41.421 --> 02:32:43.580
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we would have to invent our own values.</v>

2721
02:32:43.581 --> 02:32:45.950
<v Speaker 5>We would have to become a new type of </v>
<v Speaker 5>being,</v>

2722
02:32:46.880 --> 02:32:47.713
<v Speaker 5>but your response to that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially after World War Two was and </v>

2723
02:32:52.221 --> 02:32:54.170
<v Speaker 5>after encountering Freud was something </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2724
02:32:54.520 --> 02:32:55.353
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what makes you think we can invent our </v>

2725
02:32:56.571 --> 02:32:57.404
<v Speaker 5>own values?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So Neil Young's idea was to rediscover </v>

2726
02:33:02.871 --> 02:33:04.700
<v Speaker 5>the values of the past,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to go within.</v>

2727
02:33:04.701 --> 02:33:05.534
<v Speaker 5>That was his hero's journey to go within</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the landscape of the imagination and </v>

2728
02:33:08.931 --> 02:33:09.764
<v Speaker 5>to rekindle the archetypes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That isn't necessarily something that </v>

2729
02:33:11.961 --> 02:33:14.390
<v Speaker 5>has to be done as an internal voyage,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but</v>

2730
02:33:16.560 --> 02:33:18.990
<v Speaker 5>that made it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That made the process something that was</v>

2731
02:33:18.991 --> 02:33:21.330
<v Speaker 5>more akin to an archetypical </v>
<v Speaker 5>transformation.</v>

2732
02:33:21.360 --> 02:33:22.193
<v Speaker 5>So if it's the father that's dead,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then you go into the belly of the beast </v>

2733
02:33:26.281 --> 02:33:29.370
<v Speaker 5>to revitalize the father.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the pathway forward.</v>

2734
02:33:29.820 --> 02:33:30.653
<v Speaker 5>And that's been the pathway forward for </v>
<v Speaker 5>human beings for for as long back as we </v>

2735
02:33:34.921 --> 02:33:39.921
<v Speaker 5>know for tens of thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2736
02:33:41.480 --> 02:33:44.100
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think I'm saying that right.</v>

2737
02:33:44.101 --> 02:33:46.950
<v Speaker 5>Some Romanian wrote me the other day and</v>
<v Speaker 5>tried to teach me how to say it.</v>

2738
02:33:47.280 --> 02:33:48.810
<v Speaker 5>Merchant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's right.</v>

2739
02:33:48.840 --> 02:33:53.840
<v Speaker 5>Eliana talked about the the death of God</v>
<v Speaker 5>as a recurring phenomena.</v>

2740
02:33:54.510 --> 02:33:55.343
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's what he.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's when he realized when he did his </v>

2741
02:33:59.731 --> 02:34:00.564
<v Speaker 5>large scale surveys of religious belief </v>
<v Speaker 5>systems is the God dies very frequently </v>

2742
02:34:05.850 --> 02:34:06.683
<v Speaker 5>and then that's part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's part of what you might describe </v>

2743
02:34:09.181 --> 02:34:10.014
<v Speaker 5>as a developmental process.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's very much akin to what happens to </v>

2744
02:34:12.241 --> 02:34:13.890
<v Speaker 5>you when your dreams die.</v>

2745
02:34:14.310 --> 02:34:15.143
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you put forward a hypothesis about </v>

2746
02:34:17.170 --> 02:34:19.300
<v Speaker 5>mode of being that you would like to </v>
<v Speaker 5>embody.</v>

2747
02:34:19.720 --> 02:34:22.060
<v Speaker 5>You have a dream,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a vision and ambition,</v>

2748
02:34:22.150 --> 02:34:22.983
<v Speaker 5>maybe a love affair or something like </v>
<v Speaker 5>that and it collapses on you when </v>

2749
02:34:25.740 --> 02:34:28.540
<v Speaker 5>there's a period of death that follows </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

2750
02:34:28.900 --> 02:34:33.160
<v Speaker 5>You could call it psychological death,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then there's a reconstruction of the</v>

2751
02:34:33.161 --> 02:34:35.350
<v Speaker 5>value system and a rebirth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's.</v>

2752
02:34:35.830 --> 02:34:38.620
<v Speaker 5>That's the eternal human story.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It really is.</v>

2753
02:34:39.550 --> 02:34:42.130
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Young's contribution to niches,</v>

2754
02:34:42.131 --> 02:34:42.964
<v Speaker 5>body of thought,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this is where I think also dusty </v>

2755
02:34:45.540 --> 02:34:46.373
<v Speaker 5>does the surpassed Mnuchin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was that you realized that we didn't </v>

2756
02:34:49.571 --> 02:34:50.404
<v Speaker 5>invent our own values.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We rediscovered those values that we </v>

2757
02:34:52.991 --> 02:34:55.390
<v Speaker 5>always harbored within us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

2758
02:34:55.391 --> 02:34:56.224
<v Speaker 5>that doesn't mean that that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that they still have to be given new </v>

2759
02:34:58.841 --> 02:34:59.674
<v Speaker 5>form,</v>
<v Speaker 5>though you see this in an old story of </v>

2760
02:35:02.141 --> 02:35:03.870
<v Speaker 5>the Egyptian,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's an old story of Horus.</v>

2761
02:35:03.871 --> 02:35:04.704
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cyrus and horace goes to rescue his </v>

2762
02:35:06.911 --> 02:35:07.320
<v Speaker 5>father.</v>

2763
02:35:07.320 --> 02:35:07.931
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cyrus,</v>

2764
02:35:07.931 --> 02:35:11.710
<v Speaker 5>who's basically living like a dead ghost</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the underworld.</v>

2765
02:35:11.711 --> 02:35:12.544
<v Speaker 5>He goes to rescue him after defeating </v>
<v Speaker 5>his evil uncle goes to rescue his dead </v>

2766
02:35:15.941 --> 02:35:16.774
<v Speaker 5>father,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and when he goes down into the </v>

2767
02:35:18.041 --> 02:35:19.280
<v Speaker 5>underworld,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

2768
02:35:19.350 --> 02:35:22.930
<v Speaker 5>he has an I in his hand that seth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the evil one,</v>

2769
02:35:23.650 --> 02:35:24.483
<v Speaker 5>tore from his head during their combat </v>
<v Speaker 5>and instead of putting the [inaudible] </v>

2770
02:35:27.191 --> 02:35:28.024
<v Speaker 5>back in his head,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he gives it to his father and then his </v>

2771
02:35:30.011 --> 02:35:30.844
<v Speaker 5>father can see again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then they both go back up to the </v>

2772
02:35:33.701 --> 02:35:38.380
<v Speaker 5>surface of the world and it's their </v>
<v Speaker 5>union that constitutes the spirit of the</v>

2773
02:35:38.381 --> 02:35:39.214
<v Speaker 5>Pharaoh.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's an absolutely unbelievably </v>

2774
02:35:40.961 --> 02:35:43.240
<v Speaker 5>remarkable story because the idea is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2775
02:35:44.020 --> 02:35:47.200
<v Speaker 5>you will be damaged in your </v>
<v Speaker 5>confrontation with life,</v>

2776
02:35:47.440 --> 02:35:48.273
<v Speaker 5>particularly if you confront malevolence</v>
<v Speaker 5>because the confrontation with </v>

2777
02:35:50.921 --> 02:35:53.470
<v Speaker 5>malevolence damages people that will </v>
<v Speaker 5>damage your vision,</v>

2778
02:35:54.430 --> 02:35:57.490
<v Speaker 5>but if you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you take that damaged part of you and</v>

2779
02:35:57.491 --> 02:36:01.030
<v Speaker 5>you read united with the dead spirit of </v>
<v Speaker 5>your father,</v>

2780
02:36:01.300 --> 02:36:02.800
<v Speaker 5>then you can revitalize that.</v>

2781
02:36:02.800 --> 02:36:03.633
<v Speaker 5>That will strengthen you and that will </v>
<v Speaker 5>enable you to move forward into the </v>

2782
02:36:05.561 --> 02:36:06.394
<v Speaker 5>future.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So like that's just exactly right and </v>

2783
02:36:08.531 --> 02:36:13.531
<v Speaker 5>it's one of the deepest religious</v>
<v Speaker 5>presuppositions of humanity.</v>

2784
02:36:14.680 --> 02:36:16.150
<v Speaker 5>You see it everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That idea,</v>

2785
02:36:16.340 --> 02:36:17.830
<v Speaker 5>and that's what you're doing in </v>
<v Speaker 5>university.</v>

2786
02:36:17.831 --> 02:36:19.840
<v Speaker 5>If you take a liberal arts course </v>
<v Speaker 5>degree,</v>

2787
02:36:20.650 --> 02:36:22.100
<v Speaker 5>it's like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

2788
02:36:22.230 --> 02:36:26.440
<v Speaker 5>you're resurrecting your dead ancestors </v>
<v Speaker 5>so they can live again in your form,</v>

2789
02:36:26.560 --> 02:36:27.393
<v Speaker 5>but in conjoined union with you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're the vision that gives the dead </v>

2790
02:36:30.680 --> 02:36:31.513
<v Speaker 5>past its vitality and spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's the purpose of being </v>

2791
02:36:35.321 --> 02:36:36.154
<v Speaker 5>educated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a,</v>

2792
02:36:36.370 --> 02:36:37.203
<v Speaker 5>that's your initiation and and partly </v>
<v Speaker 5>what you do when you're initiated </v>

2793
02:36:41.411 --> 02:36:42.244
<v Speaker 5>properly in that regard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As you develop a comprehensive </v>

2794
02:36:43.751 --> 02:36:46.540
<v Speaker 5>philosophy of good and evil,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a deep philosophy of good and evil,</v>

2795
02:36:46.870 --> 02:36:47.703
<v Speaker 5>evil,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that protects you against the </v>

2796
02:36:48.851 --> 02:36:52.150
<v Speaker 5>confrontation with malevolence and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>know that you know,</v>

2797
02:36:52.151 --> 02:36:52.984
<v Speaker 5>I know that not least because one of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>things that's happened to me as a </v>

2798
02:36:57.161 --> 02:36:57.994
<v Speaker 5>consequence and putting all these </v>
<v Speaker 5>lectures online is that I've had many </v>

2799
02:36:59.951 --> 02:37:00.784
<v Speaker 5>military people write me and come and </v>
<v Speaker 5>talk to me who had posttraumatic stress </v>

2800
02:37:05.171 --> 02:37:07.840
<v Speaker 5>disorder and that's almost always a </v>
<v Speaker 5>consequence.</v>

2801
02:37:08.110 --> 02:37:11.200
<v Speaker 5>Often have them viewing themselves do </v>
<v Speaker 5>something dreadful,</v>

2802
02:37:11.440 --> 02:37:12.273
<v Speaker 5>but sometimes viewing that occurring as </v>
<v Speaker 5>a consequence of other people's actions </v>

2803
02:37:16.790 --> 02:37:18.680
<v Speaker 5>until they have a philosophy of good and</v>
<v Speaker 5>evil,</v>

2804
02:37:18.681 --> 02:37:19.514
<v Speaker 5>they can't recover from their </v>
<v Speaker 5>posttraumatic stress disorder and like </v>

2805
02:37:22.820 --> 02:37:23.540
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

2806
02:37:23.540 --> 02:37:26.240
<v Speaker 5>if you're naive,</v>
<v Speaker 5>metaphysically naive,</v>

2807
02:37:26.660 --> 02:37:29.960
<v Speaker 5>and you come in contact with someone who</v>
<v Speaker 5>truly wants to hurt you,</v>

2808
02:37:30.200 --> 02:37:33.590
<v Speaker 5>the probability that that will undo you </v>
<v Speaker 5>psychologically is very,</v>

2809
02:37:33.591 --> 02:37:37.580
<v Speaker 5>very high.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you have to be wise as serpents.</v>

2810
02:37:37.610 --> 02:37:40.820
<v Speaker 5>That's the old saying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to be wise as a serpent because</v>

2811
02:37:40.821 --> 02:37:42.860
<v Speaker 5>otherwise you have no protection against</v>
<v Speaker 5>serpents.</v>

2812
02:37:51.680 --> 02:37:52.513
<v Speaker 13>Maybe we'll do two more because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 13>starting to get fuzzy minded and I've </v>

2813
02:37:55.281 --> 02:38:00.281
<v Speaker 13>learned to quit at that point mostly.</v>
<v Speaker 13>So we talked a bit before.</v>

2814
02:38:01.750 --> 02:38:02.690
<v Speaker 13>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 13>before you started.</v>

2815
02:38:03.080 --> 02:38:06.680
<v Speaker 13>Don't know exactly how to phrase this </v>
<v Speaker 13>and I think that this will be like,</v>

2816
02:38:06.890 --> 02:38:09.860
<v Speaker 13>I do want to like acknowledge that all </v>
<v Speaker 13>of this q and a has been amazing because</v>

2817
02:38:09.861 --> 02:38:10.694
<v Speaker 13>it's basically been a lecturer mixed </v>
<v Speaker 13>with reality and that's a good </v>

2818
02:38:14.061 --> 02:38:14.990
<v Speaker 13>combination.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Yeah,</v>

2819
02:38:14.991 --> 02:38:15.824
<v Speaker 13>it's a good combination and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 13>think many speakers I go to actually </v>

2820
02:38:20.031 --> 02:38:22.040
<v Speaker 13>know how to combine that the way you </v>
<v Speaker 13>did.</v>

2821
02:38:22.041 --> 02:38:24.590
<v Speaker 13>So thank you for that.</v>
<v Speaker 13>But uh,</v>

2822
02:38:25.130 --> 02:38:25.963
<v Speaker 13>I guess this question is a bit of a </v>
<v Speaker 13>departure from that and it's sort of </v>

2823
02:38:27.920 --> 02:38:28.753
<v Speaker 13>going to something more of a say I don't</v>
<v Speaker 13>think everyone can relate to because </v>

2824
02:38:33.531 --> 02:38:34.364
<v Speaker 13>it's in your book you say don't lie.</v>
<v Speaker 13>And I think that after living 21 short </v>

2825
02:38:39.471 --> 02:38:40.940
<v Speaker 13>years,</v>
<v Speaker 13>I've learned that the hard way,</v>

2826
02:38:41.150 --> 02:38:44.660
<v Speaker 13>but you and your life and me and my </v>
<v Speaker 13>life,</v>

2827
02:38:44.930 --> 02:38:45.763
<v Speaker 13>I feel like we both had a moment where </v>
<v Speaker 13>we've had to confront a self alienating </v>

2828
02:38:51.530 --> 02:38:52.363
<v Speaker 13>instance of nature where there is no </v>
<v Speaker 13>path forward that we really have at our </v>

2829
02:38:56.451 --> 02:38:57.284
<v Speaker 13>disposal and</v>
<v Speaker 13>there was a point where an unnatural </v>

2830
02:39:01.671 --> 02:39:03.350
<v Speaker 13>amount of growth had to come out of us.</v>

2831
02:39:03.980 --> 02:39:08.980
<v Speaker 13>So I just want to know where you drew </v>
<v Speaker 13>that line at your own ability to develop</v>

2832
02:39:09.231 --> 02:39:14.231
<v Speaker 13>as a person to where you didn't become </v>
<v Speaker 13>tunnel vision with trying to face life's</v>

2833
02:39:14.841 --> 02:39:16.070
<v Speaker 13>problems on your own or.</v>

2834
02:39:16.410 --> 02:39:17.243
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well we had talked just before this </v>

2835
02:39:18.600 --> 02:39:19.433
<v Speaker 5>second part of this q and a about my </v>
<v Speaker 5>daughter's illness and about this </v>

2836
02:39:22.351 --> 02:39:24.780
<v Speaker 5>gentleman's had illness in his family </v>
<v Speaker 5>too.</v>

2837
02:39:24.781 --> 02:39:27.970
<v Speaker 5>So that's Kinda the background of this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well the first part of that is like</v>

2838
02:39:31.080 --> 02:39:34.980
<v Speaker 5>if we were going to be pessimistically </v>
<v Speaker 5>realistic about all this,</v>

2839
02:39:35.670 --> 02:39:40.670
<v Speaker 5>I would say that your best bet is truth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that doesn't necessarily mean that's</v>

2840
02:39:42.061 --> 02:39:44.430
<v Speaker 5>always going to do the trick,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2841
02:39:44.431 --> 02:39:49.431
<v Speaker 5>I mean sometimes you go fight a dragon </v>
<v Speaker 5>entity to you and if the,</v>

2842
02:39:50.550 --> 02:39:53.430
<v Speaker 5>if you being eaten wasn't a real </v>
<v Speaker 5>possibility,</v>

2843
02:39:53.940 --> 02:39:57.060
<v Speaker 5>it wouldn't be a real fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so you see people,</v>

2844
02:39:57.061 --> 02:39:57.894
<v Speaker 5>like I've seen people</v>
<v Speaker 5>in my clinical practice sometimes I had </v>

2845
02:40:02.881 --> 02:40:03.714
<v Speaker 5>one client in particular who was </v>
<v Speaker 5>undergoing a particularly vicious </v>

2846
02:40:06.631 --> 02:40:07.464
<v Speaker 5>divorce with someone who was really </v>
<v Speaker 5>seriously inclined to take him out and </v>

2847
02:40:11.731 --> 02:40:15.450
<v Speaker 5>would do pretty much everything at her </v>
<v Speaker 5>disposal to do so.</v>

2848
02:40:15.870 --> 02:40:16.703
<v Speaker 5>And I strategized with him for about </v>
<v Speaker 5>three years and we did everything like </v>

2849
02:40:21.630 --> 02:40:25.710
<v Speaker 5>at hyper carefully and he was a very </v>
<v Speaker 5>conscientious and diligent person and he</v>

2850
02:40:26.160 --> 02:40:26.993
<v Speaker 5>put into practice everything that we </v>
<v Speaker 5>discussed and strategized and he still </v>

2851
02:40:30.031 --> 02:40:32.850
<v Speaker 5>pretty much,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he got backed into a corner so hard that</v>

2852
02:40:32.851 --> 02:40:34.110
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know how to help them anymore.</v>

2853
02:40:35.040 --> 02:40:40.040
<v Speaker 5>So high would say however that he like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was a very truthful person throughout</v>

2854
02:40:40.110 --> 02:40:40.943
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And one thing he did do was part of it </v>

2855
02:40:43.201 --> 02:40:44.034
<v Speaker 5>was a custody battle and he did manage,</v>
<v Speaker 5>despite his declined in consequence of </v>

2856
02:40:51.271 --> 02:40:53.250
<v Speaker 5>being repeatedly cornered,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would say.</v>

2857
02:40:53.700 --> 02:40:54.533
<v Speaker 5>He did manage to establish what I think </v>
<v Speaker 5>was a lasting relationship with his </v>

2858
02:40:57.571 --> 02:41:02.040
<v Speaker 5>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he might've got enough out of what he</v>

2859
02:41:02.041 --> 02:41:02.874
<v Speaker 5>did to justify it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even though the whole landscape was </v>

2860
02:41:06.211 --> 02:41:11.211
<v Speaker 5>pretty awful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that not lying is your best bet,</v>

2861
02:41:13.320 --> 02:41:14.153
<v Speaker 5>but life is hard and people get run over</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it doesn't necessarily mean that </v>

2862
02:41:19.291 --> 02:41:22.080
<v Speaker 5>you're going to emerge in any obvious </v>
<v Speaker 5>sense triumphant.</v>

2863
02:41:23.130 --> 02:41:26.190
<v Speaker 5>But if you take the alternative path </v>
<v Speaker 5>path,</v>

2864
02:41:26.191 --> 02:41:29.730
<v Speaker 5>especially when you're facing severe </v>
<v Speaker 5>tribulations,</v>

2865
02:41:29.731 --> 02:41:32.760
<v Speaker 5>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you complicate those with deceit,</v>

2866
02:41:33.120 --> 02:41:36.420
<v Speaker 5>you can be sure that whatever tragedy </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you're confronting is going to turn</v>

2867
02:41:36.421 --> 02:41:39.780
<v Speaker 5>into not only tragedy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but something very much akin to hell.</v>

2868
02:41:40.830 --> 02:41:44.730
<v Speaker 5>And so you might be able to at least </v>
<v Speaker 5>minimize the degree of suffering even if</v>

2869
02:41:44.731 --> 02:41:49.290
<v Speaker 5>you can't overcome it or transcendent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's something,</v>

2870
02:41:49.320 --> 02:41:51.800
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's something I,</v>

2871
02:41:52.050 --> 02:41:52.883
<v Speaker 5>I'm always reminded in a discussion like</v>
<v Speaker 5>this of what I watched with my wife's </v>

2872
02:41:56.821 --> 02:41:59.460
<v Speaker 5>family were around the deathbed of her </v>
<v Speaker 5>mother.</v>

2873
02:41:59.490 --> 02:42:02.970
<v Speaker 5>She had</v>
<v Speaker 5>frontal temporal dementia,</v>

2874
02:42:02.971 --> 02:42:05.730
<v Speaker 5>which is like Alzheimer's and quite an </v>
<v Speaker 5>awful way to go.</v>

2875
02:42:06.690 --> 02:42:07.523
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2876
02:42:08.310 --> 02:42:11.130
<v Speaker 5>her husband,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my father in law,</v>

2877
02:42:11.760 --> 02:42:16.080
<v Speaker 5>really stepped up to the plate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like he was quite the man about town,</v>

2878
02:42:16.081 --> 02:42:19.290
<v Speaker 5>very extroverted partier type and quite </v>
<v Speaker 5>disagreeable.</v>

2879
02:42:19.320 --> 02:42:21.000
<v Speaker 5>But when his wife got sick,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

2880
02:42:21.330 --> 02:42:22.163
<v Speaker 5>he was there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was something to watch and so he </v>

2881
02:42:24.511 --> 02:42:25.344
<v Speaker 5>turned what could have been absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 5>dreadful into just miserable and then </v>

2882
02:42:29.880 --> 02:42:32.810
<v Speaker 5>when their entire family was gathered </v>
<v Speaker 5>around her death bed,</v>

2883
02:42:32.820 --> 02:42:37.820
<v Speaker 5>like my wife and her sister had both </v>
<v Speaker 5>dealt with dying people before and other</v>

2884
02:42:39.721 --> 02:42:40.554
<v Speaker 5>sister was a pharmacist and they were </v>
<v Speaker 5>attentive to their mother and there was </v>

2885
02:42:45.691 --> 02:42:46.524
<v Speaker 5>no foolish catastrophes going on between</v>
<v Speaker 5>the family and they all pulled together </v>

2886
02:42:52.500 --> 02:42:56.820
<v Speaker 5>and so their mother died.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But what I observed was that their bonds</v>

2887
02:42:56.821 --> 02:42:57.654
<v Speaker 5>were strengthened as a consequence and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that they gained something from the </v>

2888
02:43:01.381 --> 02:43:02.214
<v Speaker 5>tightening of the remaining </v>
<v Speaker 5>relationships that was at least partial </v>

2889
02:43:04.681 --> 02:43:06.510
<v Speaker 5>compensation for the loss of their </v>
<v Speaker 5>mother.</v>

2890
02:43:07.200 --> 02:43:10.710
<v Speaker 5>And that beat the hell out of squabbling</v>
<v Speaker 5>about everything while she was dying.</v>

2891
02:43:11.200 --> 02:43:14.170
<v Speaker 5>Because that's a real possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And people certainly do that.</v>

2892
02:43:14.940 --> 02:43:15.773
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

2893
02:43:20.360 --> 02:43:22.700
<v Speaker 5>one more,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and maybe we'll call it a night.</v>

2894
02:43:28.130 --> 02:43:33.130
<v Speaker 14>The one thing that has been kind of </v>
<v Speaker 14>going through my mind in this discussion</v>

2895
02:43:33.791 --> 02:43:36.750
<v Speaker 14>in general,</v>
<v Speaker 14>personally,</v>

2896
02:43:36.900 --> 02:43:37.733
<v Speaker 14>one of the most interesting aspects of </v>
<v Speaker 14>neuroscience to me is the capacity to </v>

2897
02:43:43.691 --> 02:43:48.691
<v Speaker 14>change the adaptive.</v>
<v Speaker 14>But I think that the issue in your talks</v>

2898
02:43:49.151 --> 02:43:52.330
<v Speaker 14>and you know you're already doing so </v>
<v Speaker 14>that people</v>

2899
02:43:54.760 --> 02:43:55.593
<v Speaker 14>can be</v>
<v Speaker 14>five points that will never be stagnant </v>

2900
02:44:00.281 --> 02:44:01.114
<v Speaker 14>and not to shame therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 14>They don't really understand that maybe </v>

2901
02:44:05.411 --> 02:44:09.520
<v Speaker 14>to the love that they should be.</v>
<v Speaker 14>Right.</v>

2902
02:44:09.580 --> 02:44:14.580
<v Speaker 14>And so my opinion is that that indicates</v>
<v Speaker 14>a little bit of a paragraph that was,</v>

2903
02:44:16.120 --> 02:44:17.380
<v Speaker 14>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 14>we are wired,</v>

2904
02:44:17.381 --> 02:44:20.920
<v Speaker 14>we are hardwired essentially adapt to </v>
<v Speaker 14>change.</v>

2905
02:44:20.950 --> 02:44:24.800
<v Speaker 14>We're able to change ourselves to </v>
<v Speaker 14>respond to the same line,</v>

2906
02:44:24.870 --> 02:44:26.800
<v Speaker 14>our environmental,</v>
<v Speaker 14>our brand itself,</v>

2907
02:44:27.100 --> 02:44:29.260
<v Speaker 14>not just our behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 14>but the actual,</v>

2908
02:44:29.750 --> 02:44:32.140
<v Speaker 14>the in our vision of what's actually </v>
<v Speaker 14>changing.</v>

2909
02:44:32.440 --> 02:44:34.600
<v Speaker 14>So you're already is that a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 14>people will become,</v>

2910
02:44:34.920 --> 02:44:36.640
<v Speaker 14>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 14>to this and they'll stay stagnant.</v>

2911
02:44:36.641 --> 02:44:37.474
<v Speaker 14>So how do you explain what aspects of </v>
<v Speaker 14>cultural phenomena or just social </v>

2912
02:44:41.501 --> 02:44:44.200
<v Speaker 14>discourse,</v>
<v Speaker 14>what is so powerful about that,</v>

2913
02:44:44.201 --> 02:44:47.000
<v Speaker 14>that it overcomes,</v>
<v Speaker 14>are predisposed conditions?</v>

2914
02:44:48.960 --> 02:44:50.910
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>changes changes,</v>

2915
02:44:52.710 --> 02:44:56.920
<v Speaker 5>especially if it's the more radical than</v>
<v Speaker 5>necessary change.</v>

2916
02:44:56.921 --> 02:45:00.630
<v Speaker 5>The more pain that accompanies it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the more opportunity as well.</v>

2917
02:45:01.260 --> 02:45:02.820
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and a lot of what we learned,</v>

2918
02:45:02.821 --> 02:45:03.654
<v Speaker 5>we learned painfully.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so it's not surprising that people </v>

2919
02:45:05.851 --> 02:45:06.684
<v Speaker 5>shrink away from learning.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We learn in pain and anxiety very </v>

2920
02:45:09.721 --> 02:45:11.160
<v Speaker 5>frequently.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everyone knows that,</v>

2921
02:45:11.220 --> 02:45:14.190
<v Speaker 5>like the things that really that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>really learned in life,</v>

2922
02:45:14.220 --> 02:45:19.220
<v Speaker 5>it's like it was no joy man and get took</v>
<v Speaker 5>you out and so the fact that people flee</v>

2923
02:45:19.271 --> 02:45:23.220
<v Speaker 5>from that is hardly surprising,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it doesn't help.</v>

2924
02:45:23.250 --> 02:45:24.083
<v Speaker 5>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just stores up the catastrophe for </v>

2925
02:45:26.191 --> 02:45:31.191
<v Speaker 5>later and so the better the better ideas</v>
<v Speaker 5>to eat a little poison every day so that</v>

2926
02:45:31.711 --> 02:45:32.544
<v Speaker 5>you don't have to overdose in a month.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's something like that and it is the </v>

2927
02:45:36.421 --> 02:45:41.421
<v Speaker 5>case that I think because you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you aren't forced.</v>

2928
02:45:41.610 --> 02:45:42.443
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't learn unless you're forced to </v>

2929
02:45:43.531 --> 02:45:44.100
<v Speaker 5>learn.</v>

2930
02:45:44.100 --> 02:45:44.933
<v Speaker 5>I know there's alternatives to that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's the voluntary search for </v>

2931
02:45:47.161 --> 02:45:50.730
<v Speaker 5>knowledge and that's a fine thing and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that is an antidote to this,</v>

2932
02:45:50.970 --> 02:45:55.260
<v Speaker 5>but apart from that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>speaking more practically,</v>

2933
02:45:56.070 --> 02:45:56.903
<v Speaker 5>you tend not to learn unless you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>forced to learn and it's and what you </v>

2934
02:46:00.181 --> 02:46:01.014
<v Speaker 5>tend to learn by force or difficult </v>
<v Speaker 5>lessons and so people are very prone to </v>

2935
02:46:05.760 --> 02:46:10.190
<v Speaker 5>not to not seek that out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not surprising,</v>

2936
02:46:11.120 --> 02:46:14.000
<v Speaker 5>but it's because they don't understand </v>
<v Speaker 5>the consequences very well.</v>

2937
02:46:15.570 --> 02:46:16.610
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

2938
02:46:16.670 --> 02:46:17.503
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's because maybe it's because they're </v>

2939
02:46:19.730 --> 02:46:20.563
<v Speaker 5>convinced that there's some way of </v>
<v Speaker 5>forestalling the necessary learning and </v>

2940
02:46:24.110 --> 02:46:24.943
<v Speaker 5>there isn't any way of forestalling it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All you do is make it worse in the </v>

2941
02:46:28.311 --> 02:46:29.144
<v Speaker 5>future.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You make yourself smaller and you make </v>

2942
02:46:30.651 --> 02:46:31.484
<v Speaker 5>the lesson harder,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so that's why in so many religious </v>

2943
02:46:35.300 --> 02:46:40.300
<v Speaker 5>doctrines there's emphasis on humility.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Humility is to debase yourself.</v>

2944
02:46:42.100 --> 02:46:42.933
<v Speaker 5>It's to understand that you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 5>enough so that your life isn't going to </v>

2945
02:46:46.371 --> 02:46:51.371
<v Speaker 5>be miserable and so every chance you get</v>
<v Speaker 5>to grab something new that will help you</v>

2946
02:46:51.831 --> 02:46:55.280
<v Speaker 5>along your way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You should take it as fast as you can,</v>

2947
02:46:55.730 --> 02:47:00.470
<v Speaker 5>but you have to have a very</v>
<v Speaker 5>tragic,</v>

2948
02:47:01.340 --> 02:47:02.173
<v Speaker 5>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>view of reality and also harsh one </v>

2949
02:47:04.340 --> 02:47:06.710
<v Speaker 5>because it's not just tragedy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's also malevolence.</v>

2950
02:47:06.711 --> 02:47:07.544
<v Speaker 5>You have to understand that those are </v>
<v Speaker 5>waiting for you and that makes you </v>

2951
02:47:11.001 --> 02:47:15.740
<v Speaker 5>desperate enough to learn and that might</v>
<v Speaker 5>be make you desperate enough to fall out</v>

2952
02:47:15.741 --> 02:47:19.040
<v Speaker 5>of the radiology,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's.</v>

2953
02:47:19.270 --> 02:47:23.780
<v Speaker 5>That's a hard way of looking at the </v>
<v Speaker 5>world beats living through it though.</v>

2954
02:47:27.310 --> 02:47:32.310
<v Speaker 2>It's was very nice talking to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
