1
00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:03.960
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>running.</v>

2
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.283
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

3
00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:18.663
<v Speaker 2>so let's talk about your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's lots of different ways of </v>

4
00:00:22.891 --> 00:00:26.580
<v Speaker 2>dividing up the brain and believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are still arguing about how to do</v>

5
00:00:26.581 --> 00:00:27.870
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

6
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:29.490
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember if I</v>

7
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.570
<v Speaker 2>signed the Swanson paper to you as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>reading.</v>

8
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.610
<v Speaker 2>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do any of you remember that?</v>

9
00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.500
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's there.</v>

10
00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.210
<v Speaker 2>It's very hard paper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very,</v>

11
00:00:41.211 --> 00:00:42.080
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very hard.</v>

12
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.230
<v Speaker 2>What I want you to do is to familiarize </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself with it.</v>

13
00:00:45.231 --> 00:00:46.064
<v Speaker 2>I mean it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone's whole life work and he's </v>

14
00:00:47.451 --> 00:00:52.451
<v Speaker 2>really smart so you're just not going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be able to digest the entire paper,</v>

15
00:00:52.611 --> 00:00:53.444
<v Speaker 2>but it's a brilliant paper and Swanson </v>
<v Speaker 2>is a developmental neuro added an </v>

16
00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.153
<v Speaker 2>anatomist and he basically envisions the</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain using a conceptual schema that's </v>

17
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.890
<v Speaker 2>based on how it transforms itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I turned it on across time.</v>

18
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.093
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what I really love about Swanson is </v>

19
00:01:11.931 --> 00:01:14.390
<v Speaker 2>that he builds the brain from the bottom</v>
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

20
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.400
<v Speaker 2>from the body upwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

21
00:01:16.401 --> 00:01:17.234
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's incredibly useful because </v>

22
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:20.683
<v Speaker 2>there's a real dualism that still </v>
<v Speaker 2>saturates almost all of the conceptions </v>

23
00:01:25.341 --> 00:01:29.330
<v Speaker 2>that you hear about the brain in most </v>
<v Speaker 2>areas in psychology,</v>

24
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.033
<v Speaker 2>certainly being one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we kind of treat the brain as if it's </v>

25
00:01:33.771 --> 00:01:36.560
<v Speaker 2>the place of the mind and the mind to </v>
<v Speaker 2>something separate from the body,</v>

26
00:01:36.561 --> 00:01:37.394
<v Speaker 2>and you could just sort of take your </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain out of your body and you'd still </v>

27
00:01:39.291 --> 00:01:42.380
<v Speaker 2>have a mind and it's like no wrong.</v>

28
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:43.423
<v Speaker 2>One of the things the ai people </v>
<v Speaker 2>discovered after many decades of trying </v>

29
00:01:46.761 --> 00:01:50.270
<v Speaker 2>to make things intelligent was that </v>
<v Speaker 2>until they put them in a body,</v>

30
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.433
<v Speaker 2>things weren't intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So intelligent seems integrally linked </v>

31
00:01:54.891 --> 00:01:59.891
<v Speaker 2>to the ability to maneuver yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>through space in a physically embodied,</v>

32
00:02:00.501 --> 00:02:02.390
<v Speaker 2>limited forum and to manipulate the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

33
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.640
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so your body is.</v>

34
00:02:04.641 --> 00:02:08.510
<v Speaker 2>Your brain is first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your brain isn't in your head anyways.</v>

35
00:02:08.511 --> 00:02:09.344
<v Speaker 2>It's distributed throughout your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All you have to do is look at the </v>

36
00:02:10.851 --> 00:02:13.010
<v Speaker 2>nervous system to figure that out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Second,</v>

37
00:02:13.011 --> 00:02:13.844
<v Speaker 2>there's more neurons in your autonomic </v>
<v Speaker 2>nervous system than there are in your </v>

38
00:02:16.401 --> 00:02:17.870
<v Speaker 2>central nervous system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

39
00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your brain is not only in your head,</v>

40
00:02:20.691 --> 00:02:22.520
<v Speaker 2>it's a really foolish way of thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it,</v>

41
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.640
<v Speaker 2>so all right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Having said that,</v>

42
00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.893
<v Speaker 2>there are multiple ways of </v>
<v Speaker 2>conceptualizing the brain and a lot of </v>

43
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:30.793
<v Speaker 2>whether or not the conceptual structure </v>
<v Speaker 2>is accurate is whether or not it's </v>

44
00:02:33.261 --> 00:02:34.094
<v Speaker 2>useful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm going to go through a couple </v>

45
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.410
<v Speaker 2>because they are useful in different </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways.</v>

46
00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.410
<v Speaker 2>This is one that's basically based on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the model that Russian neuropsychologist</v>

47
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.040
<v Speaker 2>produced,</v>
<v Speaker 2>led by Luria,</v>

48
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.903
<v Speaker 2>who was the greatest Russian </v>
<v Speaker 2>neuropsychologist and who had amazing </v>

49
00:02:46.821 --> 00:02:47.654
<v Speaker 2>students and many of them laid down the </v>
<v Speaker 2>groundwork for the models that we're </v>

50
00:02:51.021 --> 00:02:54.290
<v Speaker 2>going to describe and they were heavily </v>
<v Speaker 2>influenced by cybernetic thinking by the</v>

51
00:02:54.291 --> 00:02:55.200
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

52
00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.710
<v Speaker 2>the two fields played like this over </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the 19 twenties till now.</v>

53
00:02:59.711 --> 00:03:02.110
<v Speaker 2>Really so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So from the,</v>

54
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.093
<v Speaker 2>from the Lurie and perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your brain is basically something that </v>

55
00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:09.550
<v Speaker 2>acts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's acts in the world and perceives the</v>

56
00:03:09.551 --> 00:03:11.530
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the back half of the brain,</v>

57
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:12.543
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is for perceiving and the front half is </v>

58
00:03:16.241 --> 00:03:18.580
<v Speaker 2>for acting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now here's something to think about.</v>

59
00:03:18.581 --> 00:03:19.414
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you've been taught the </v>

60
00:03:20.411 --> 00:03:23.680
<v Speaker 2>prefrontal cortex is the seat of </v>
<v Speaker 2>abstract thought.</v>

61
00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.440
<v Speaker 2>You know the seat of executive decision </v>
<v Speaker 2>making,</v>

62
00:03:26.441 --> 00:03:27.274
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like I'm not so convinced about </v>

63
00:03:29.831 --> 00:03:30.664
<v Speaker 2>that theory for a variety of reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one of the things that's that is </v>

64
00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:38.200
<v Speaker 2>true about the prefrontal cortex is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>during the course of evolution,</v>

65
00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.280
<v Speaker 2>it grew out of the motor cortex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you look at this representation,</v>

66
00:03:42.281 --> 00:03:47.110
<v Speaker 2>the top one there is the primary zone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the motor strip,</v>

67
00:03:47.111 --> 00:03:47.944
<v Speaker 2>and then the secondary zone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the premotor strip and the </v>

68
00:03:50.141 --> 00:03:52.360
<v Speaker 2>tertiary zone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the prefrontal Cortex,</v>

69
00:03:52.361 --> 00:03:53.194
<v Speaker 2>and basically what happened was that </v>
<v Speaker 2>first animals learn how to act and then </v>

70
00:03:56.621 --> 00:04:00.520
<v Speaker 2>they learned how to represent actions </v>
<v Speaker 2>before they implemented them.</v>

71
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:01.593
<v Speaker 2>So the purpose of thinking is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>represent actions before you implement </v>

72
00:04:04.151 --> 00:04:06.580
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not only auctions because there</v>

73
00:04:06.581 --> 00:04:08.890
<v Speaker 2>aren't only actions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

74
00:04:08.891 --> 00:04:09.724
<v Speaker 2>Because to act,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you also have to perceive and so really </v>

75
00:04:11.741 --> 00:04:12.574
<v Speaker 2>what the prefrontal cortex does is run </v>
<v Speaker 2>simulations of how a personality might </v>

76
00:04:16.991 --> 00:04:17.824
<v Speaker 2>operate and embodied personality might </v>
<v Speaker 2>operate in a fictional world and that's </v>

77
00:04:21.851 --> 00:04:22.684
<v Speaker 2>what you're doing when you're thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also what you're doing when you're </v>

78
00:04:24.881 --> 00:04:27.730
<v Speaker 2>watching movies or reading fiction or </v>
<v Speaker 2>any of those sorts of things,</v>

79
00:04:27.731 --> 00:04:28.564
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead of having to act something out </v>

80
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.460
<v Speaker 2>and potentially dying as a consequence </v>
<v Speaker 2>of it,</v>

81
00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:34.563
<v Speaker 2>you can watch something being simulated </v>
<v Speaker 2>and see what happens and then if the </v>

82
00:04:38.891 --> 00:04:39.724
<v Speaker 2>outcome is good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can implement it and if the outcome </v>

83
00:04:40.931 --> 00:04:42.760
<v Speaker 2>isn't good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can let it die.</v>

84
00:04:42.761 --> 00:04:45.970
<v Speaker 2>And so I think it was Alfred North </v>
<v Speaker 2>Whitehead that said,</v>

85
00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.850
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the purpose of thought is so that we can</v>

86
00:04:48.851 --> 00:04:52.180
<v Speaker 2>let our hypotheses die instead of us.</v>

87
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.210
<v Speaker 2>That's smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a very smart thing.</v>

88
00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:56.044
<v Speaker 2>And so what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's happened in some senses that </v>

89
00:04:57.791 --> 00:05:01.270
<v Speaker 2>human beings have gone from evolution to</v>
<v Speaker 2>mete evolution,</v>

90
00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:02.980
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead of evolving,</v>

91
00:05:02.981 --> 00:05:05.680
<v Speaker 2>we can model evolution and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>implement.</v>

92
00:05:05.681 --> 00:05:08.230
<v Speaker 2>The idea is the personality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>

93
00:05:08.231 --> 00:05:10.840
<v Speaker 2>that we think are most functional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we let the,</v>

94
00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.883
<v Speaker 2>we let our fantasy do the selection </v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of the actual world and it's a </v>

95
00:05:15.701 --> 00:05:17.650
<v Speaker 2>brilliant solution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so brilliant solution.</v>

96
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:18.783
<v Speaker 2>So in some sense the sensory unit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the back half of the brain is </v>

97
00:05:23.171 --> 00:05:26.560
<v Speaker 2>setting up your frameworks of perception</v>
<v Speaker 2>and integrating them.</v>

98
00:05:26.561 --> 00:05:27.394
<v Speaker 2>And then the front half is determining </v>
<v Speaker 2>how to sequence activities and modes of </v>

99
00:05:32.891 --> 00:05:36.190
<v Speaker 2>perception in order to act successfully </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the world.</v>

100
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.680
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's the actual implementation</v>

101
00:05:38.681 --> 00:05:41.620
<v Speaker 2>of the auction and then there's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>modeling of the implementation,</v>

102
00:05:41.621 --> 00:05:44.130
<v Speaker 2>which is what gives rise to thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

103
00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:45.013
<v Speaker 2>I do think that it's very useful to </v>
<v Speaker 2>think of thinking as a simulated </v>

104
00:05:49.631 --> 00:05:50.290
<v Speaker 2>personality.</v>

105
00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:51.123
<v Speaker 2>Fundamentally you're running avatars of </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself in some sense in your </v>

106
00:05:55.271 --> 00:05:58.550
<v Speaker 2>imagination and trying to determine ones</v>
<v Speaker 2>are going to be successful.</v>

107
00:05:58.551 --> 00:06:01.160
<v Speaker 2>Now you may have noticed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>given that I used the word Avatar,</v>

108
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.490
<v Speaker 2>that we've also now figured out who </v>
<v Speaker 2>acts,</v>

109
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:04.663
<v Speaker 2>how to externalize the process of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fantasy back into the actual world so </v>

110
00:06:08.241 --> 00:06:09.074
<v Speaker 2>that we can run simulations in fantasy </v>
<v Speaker 2>on machinery and we can play out </v>

111
00:06:13.131 --> 00:06:16.670
<v Speaker 2>potentials that way instead of only </v>
<v Speaker 2>having to do it in our brain.</v>

112
00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:18.120
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

113
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.930
<v Speaker 2>that's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very smart,</v>

114
00:06:20.931 --> 00:06:21.764
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's extraordinarily smart and it's </v>

115
00:06:23.511 --> 00:06:26.060
<v Speaker 2>really going to change things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God only knows for how.</v>

116
00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:29.330
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things about Larry is </v>
<v Speaker 2>model.</v>

117
00:06:29.331 --> 00:06:31.610
<v Speaker 2>You see that there's primary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>secondary,</v>

118
00:06:31.611 --> 00:06:32.444
<v Speaker 2>and tertiary zones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The tertiary zones are zones of </v>

119
00:06:35.331 --> 00:06:38.570
<v Speaker 2>integration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the primary zones or zones where,</v>

120
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:43.600
<v Speaker 2>especially in the sensory systems where </v>
<v Speaker 2>each senses elaborated in its entirety,</v>

121
00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:48.020
<v Speaker 2>resolution sense before it becomes </v>
<v Speaker 2>integrated with the other senses.</v>

122
00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:48.853
<v Speaker 2>And so the tertiary zones are actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>areas of overlap between the sense </v>

123
00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:55.610
<v Speaker 2>between the census.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

124
00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:58.603
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you read silently my experience of </v>

125
00:07:01.431 --> 00:07:03.920
<v Speaker 2>reading silently as I hear the words in </v>
<v Speaker 2>my head,</v>

126
00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.530
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while you might think,</v>

127
00:07:06.531 --> 00:07:07.280
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

128
00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.020
<v Speaker 2>you look at a word and you hear it in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your head,</v>

129
00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.090
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how in the world is that possible?</v>

130
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:14.900
<v Speaker 2>And the answer is your eyes are using </v>
<v Speaker 2>your auditory system.</v>

131
00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:16.243
<v Speaker 2>So there's overlap between the visual </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the auditory system in the tertiary </v>

132
00:07:19.131 --> 00:07:19.964
<v Speaker 2>zones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so basically what you're doing is </v>

133
00:07:21.321 --> 00:07:22.154
<v Speaker 2>hearing with your eyes and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your consciousness has this property of </v>

134
00:07:25.971 --> 00:07:27.170
<v Speaker 2>unification,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

135
00:07:27.171 --> 00:07:29.620
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of like a unified experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Larry,</v>

136
00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:30.463
<v Speaker 2>I believe that it was the tertiary zones</v>
<v Speaker 2>that gave rise to that phenomena of </v>

137
00:07:33.771 --> 00:07:36.620
<v Speaker 2>unified experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a very smart character.</v>

138
00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:38.053
<v Speaker 2>So the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that the motor unit is basically </v>

139
00:07:41.781 --> 00:07:42.614
<v Speaker 2>utilize the part of us that does </v>
<v Speaker 2>planning forward planning and forward </v>

140
00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:50.810
<v Speaker 2>thinking is utilized to layout simulated</v>
<v Speaker 2>personalities in the world.</v>

141
00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.700
<v Speaker 2>That's a good way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

142
00:07:52.701 --> 00:07:53.534
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's one kind of neurological </v>

143
00:07:54.771 --> 00:07:55.604
<v Speaker 2>model.</v>

144
00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.680
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's see.</v>

145
00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:03.740
<v Speaker 2>You want to go to more of the neurology </v>
<v Speaker 2>here first.</v>

146
00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.650
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you look at the motor strip,</v>

147
00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:08.743
<v Speaker 2>this is called a whole mount keyless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when wilder penfield was initially </v>

148
00:08:12.801 --> 00:08:16.640
<v Speaker 2>doing open like brain surgery on people </v>
<v Speaker 2>with epilepsy,</v>

149
00:08:16.641 --> 00:08:17.474
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're generally conscious during brain </v>

150
00:08:18.651 --> 00:08:19.484
<v Speaker 2>surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is rather horrifying thing to </v>

151
00:08:20.481 --> 00:08:24.440
<v Speaker 2>contemplate because they don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>cut out a part that you might need.</v>

152
00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:27.620
<v Speaker 2>And so they poke around in there often </v>
<v Speaker 2>with electrodes and you know,</v>

153
00:08:27.621 --> 00:08:30.100
<v Speaker 2>you can report what's happening to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

154
00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.900
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what pennfield did was,</v>

155
00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:34.123
<v Speaker 2>was do Electra Electra electrode mapping</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the manner in which your body was </v>

156
00:08:39.921 --> 00:08:43.520
<v Speaker 2>represented in the primary motor area </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was responsible for,</v>

157
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:46.730
<v Speaker 2>for sequencing action.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what he found was this,</v>

158
00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:51.620
<v Speaker 2>now usually you don't see it like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the way your body is laid out in</v>

159
00:08:51.621 --> 00:08:52.454
<v Speaker 2>your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of torn apart and stretched </v>

160
00:08:54.471 --> 00:08:55.680
<v Speaker 2>out over the strip.</v>

161
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:56.843
<v Speaker 2>And there's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's weird places where the parts </v>

162
00:08:59.671 --> 00:09:00.990
<v Speaker 2>come together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

163
00:09:00.991 --> 00:09:03.240
<v Speaker 2>there's a motor court,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a motor Homunculus,</v>

164
00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:04.523
<v Speaker 2>and there's a sensory homonculus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the weird characteristics of </v>

165
00:09:07.081 --> 00:09:07.914
<v Speaker 2>the sensory homonculus is that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>genital region is right beside the </v>

166
00:09:10.771 --> 00:09:14.040
<v Speaker 2>region for the feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that you can infer</v>

167
00:09:14.041 --> 00:09:14.874
<v Speaker 2>from that is that's why people take such</v>
<v Speaker 2>delight in such things as foot massages </v>

168
00:09:17.791 --> 00:09:19.530
<v Speaker 2>and why feet fetishes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

169
00:09:19.531 --> 00:09:22.740
<v Speaker 2>are quite common because the areas do </v>
<v Speaker 2>bleed into one another.</v>

170
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:25.350
<v Speaker 2>So that's pretty amusing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

171
00:09:25.351 --> 00:09:26.970
<v Speaker 2>there's the hmong canvas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you might say,</v>

172
00:09:26.971 --> 00:09:27.804
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how your brain thinks of your </v>

173
00:09:28.981 --> 00:09:31.410
<v Speaker 2>body in terms of what you can do with </v>
<v Speaker 2>your body.</v>

174
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:34.290
<v Speaker 2>And so that's like a human being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's in fact,</v>

175
00:09:34.291 --> 00:09:36.270
<v Speaker 2>that might be more what a human being is</v>
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

176
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:37.463
<v Speaker 2>Then the human being used,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see when you just look at a human being </v>

177
00:09:40.321 --> 00:09:43.110
<v Speaker 2>and what you see is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

178
00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:46.980
<v Speaker 2>we're pretty handy when we're pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>damn mouthy.</v>

179
00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:50.310
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the ways you can think </v>
<v Speaker 2>about that,</v>

180
00:09:50.311 --> 00:09:51.144
<v Speaker 2>and I think it's right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that human beings running around </v>

181
00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:53.753
<v Speaker 2>taking things apart and putting them </v>
<v Speaker 2>back together with their hands and then </v>

182
00:09:56.011 --> 00:09:58.380
<v Speaker 2>they talk about that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

183
00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:02.760
<v Speaker 2>and we have a tremendous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>control over our tongue.</v>

184
00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.680
<v Speaker 2>Now it's wired up right at birth by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

185
00:10:04.681 --> 00:10:05.514
<v Speaker 2>and lips as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a primary investigative </v>

186
00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:08.520
<v Speaker 2>Oregon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

187
00:10:08.521 --> 00:10:10.680
<v Speaker 2>and it's used for multiple purposes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

188
00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:11.803
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>children really explore the world with </v>

189
00:10:13.021 --> 00:10:13.854
<v Speaker 2>their lips and tongue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course it's a primary area for </v>

190
00:10:15.841 --> 00:10:18.150
<v Speaker 2>sexual exploration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also,</v>

191
00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:19.243
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also the part of our body that we </v>

192
00:10:21.361 --> 00:10:22.194
<v Speaker 2>use to transform the things that we can </v>
<v Speaker 2>do with our hands into patterns of </v>

193
00:10:26.191 --> 00:10:27.024
<v Speaker 2>communication so that we can speak about</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we do with our hands so that other </v>

194
00:10:31.531 --> 00:10:33.420
<v Speaker 2>people can learn how to do that with </v>
<v Speaker 2>their hands.</v>

195
00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:34.253
<v Speaker 2>And if you look at your hands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you'll see is you're mostly thumbs </v>

196
00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:37.801
<v Speaker 2>right in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

197
00:10:37.801 --> 00:10:38.634
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that you always learn </v>
<v Speaker 2>from scientists is that it's an </v>

198
00:10:40.471 --> 00:10:44.760
<v Speaker 2>opposable thumb that makes us human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And certainly the thumb,</v>

199
00:10:44.761 --> 00:10:49.410
<v Speaker 2>especially on the right hand is like you</v>
<v Speaker 2>see you've got more motor cortex devoted</v>

200
00:10:49.411 --> 00:10:51.600
<v Speaker 2>to your damn thumb than you do to your </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole body.</v>

201
00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:52.950
<v Speaker 2>And that's because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

202
00:10:52.951 --> 00:10:55.080
<v Speaker 2>I tried picking up a ranch with your </v>
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>

203
00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.390
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just not going to get very far.</v>

204
00:10:57.391 --> 00:10:58.224
<v Speaker 2>And so it's really useful to think about</v>
<v Speaker 2>the brain body in this hunkeler killer </v>

205
00:11:02.201 --> 00:11:03.034
<v Speaker 2>fashion because it also helps you </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand other things because you'll </v>

206
00:11:05.491 --> 00:11:06.810
<v Speaker 2>hear people say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

207
00:11:06.811 --> 00:11:07.644
<v Speaker 2>dolphins are super human in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence because they're in </v>

208
00:11:09.961 --> 00:11:12.810
<v Speaker 2>centralization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Quotient is higher than ours,</v>

209
00:11:12.811 --> 00:11:13.644
<v Speaker 2>and the encephalization quotient is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ratio of brain tissue to the race to </v>

210
00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:18.180
<v Speaker 2>bodyweight.</v>

211
00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:20.520
<v Speaker 2>Fundamentally brain weight to body </v>
<v Speaker 2>weight.</v>

212
00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:21.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

213
00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:23.003
<v Speaker 2>That's a measure of intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the thing is is that imagine adults </v>

214
00:11:26.461 --> 00:11:27.294
<v Speaker 2>in homonculus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like what the hell are they going </v>

215
00:11:29.051 --> 00:11:29.884
<v Speaker 2>to do with all that intelligence?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like nose up some dirt on the bottom of </v>

216
00:11:32.821 --> 00:11:34.620
<v Speaker 2>the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's about it.</v>

217
00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:35.783
<v Speaker 2>They can't build anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't take things apart and put </v>

218
00:11:37.981 --> 00:11:38.814
<v Speaker 2>them back together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so whatever their brain is being </v>

219
00:11:40.891 --> 00:11:41.724
<v Speaker 2>used for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has very little relationship to what </v>

220
00:11:44.221 --> 00:11:45.054
<v Speaker 2>our brain is being used for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our bodies are articulated where Adolfo </v>

221
00:11:47.941 --> 00:11:49.980
<v Speaker 2>does sort of like a test tube,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

222
00:11:49.981 --> 00:11:52.920
<v Speaker 2>and they can swim like mad and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously extremely playful,</v>

223
00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:55.330
<v Speaker 2>which is one of the attributes of </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligent creatures,</v>

224
00:11:55.660 --> 00:12:00.340
<v Speaker 2>but they're not taking things apart and </v>
<v Speaker 2>putting them back together like we are.</v>

225
00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.110
<v Speaker 2>And that's what we're doing all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

226
00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:05.950
<v Speaker 2>We do that with our speech is in fact </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

227
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:09.790
<v Speaker 2>the essence of taking things apart and </v>
<v Speaker 2>putting them back together.</v>

228
00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:11.840
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the hypothesis are with,</v>

229
00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:14.370
<v Speaker 2>with regards to speech development that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we.</v>

230
00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:19.750
<v Speaker 2>We developed our capacity for </v>
<v Speaker 2>articulated movement before we developed</v>

231
00:12:19.751 --> 00:12:23.950
<v Speaker 2>our capacity for language and that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>only reason we ever developed a capacity</v>

232
00:12:23.951 --> 00:12:24.784
<v Speaker 2>for language was because it sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>developed as a secondary consequence of </v>

233
00:12:28.571 --> 00:12:31.570
<v Speaker 2>our developed ability to produce </v>
<v Speaker 2>articulated action.</v>

234
00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:34.330
<v Speaker 2>Now the two things probably spiraled </v>
<v Speaker 2>across time,</v>

235
00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:36.310
<v Speaker 2>so I don't think you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

236
00:12:36.311 --> 00:12:39.130
<v Speaker 2>it's not a chicken came first and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>the egg issue,</v>

237
00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:43.390
<v Speaker 2>it's that chickens have eggs and eggs </v>
<v Speaker 2>have chickens and that just keeps going.</v>

238
00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:48.810
<v Speaker 2>But the point is is that our ability to </v>
<v Speaker 2>represent things in an articulate manner</v>

239
00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:55.350
<v Speaker 2>is directly related to our ability to </v>
<v Speaker 2>use our joints in an articulated manner.</v>

240
00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:57.100
<v Speaker 2>And so that's what we're like in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

241
00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:00.610
<v Speaker 2>We're out there doing things to it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then talking about it,</v>

242
00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:03.220
<v Speaker 2>we're very handy and we're very mouthy.</v>

243
00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:04.563
<v Speaker 2>So that's useful to know because that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of how the brain pictures of the </v>

244
00:13:08.531 --> 00:13:13.531
<v Speaker 2>body and the fact that the brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>pictures of the body that way means that</v>

245
00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:17.760
<v Speaker 2>that's how the brain conceptualizes the </v>
<v Speaker 2>body as an entity for use in,</v>

246
00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:19.210
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the environment.</v>

247
00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:20.291
<v Speaker 2>And so you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

248
00:13:20.291 --> 00:13:22.690
<v Speaker 2>how do human beings adapt?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

249
00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:24.543
<v Speaker 2>we run around taking things apart and </v>
<v Speaker 2>putting them back together with her </v>

250
00:13:27.581 --> 00:13:30.460
<v Speaker 2>hands and talking about it and we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>very good at that.</v>

251
00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:31.810
<v Speaker 2>And so you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

252
00:13:31.811 --> 00:13:35.620
<v Speaker 2>in some sense that's our primary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that that's.</v>

253
00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:38.590
<v Speaker 2>It's a reflect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

254
00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:39.753
<v Speaker 2>it's a reflection of the same processes </v>
<v Speaker 2>that gave rise to the idea of the hero </v>

255
00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:47.230
<v Speaker 2>because there's two ways of adapting to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world in some sense.</v>

256
00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:50.320
<v Speaker 2>One way is just to do what everyone else</v>
<v Speaker 2>has done.</v>

257
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:53.290
<v Speaker 2>That's always worked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All animals do that.</v>

258
00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:54.970
<v Speaker 2>That's what they do.</v>

259
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.340
<v Speaker 2>Like bears now and bears a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>

260
00:13:57.341 --> 00:14:00.370
<v Speaker 2>It's like they're the same bear even </v>
<v Speaker 2>though they're very complicated.</v>

261
00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:01.660
<v Speaker 2>Same with chimps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

262
00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:04.090
<v Speaker 2>people say chimps have culture and can </v>
<v Speaker 2>make tools.</v>

263
00:14:04.091 --> 00:14:05.380
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's wrong,</v>

264
00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:06.723
<v Speaker 2>and here's why it's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If a chimp could increase its domain of </v>

265
00:14:12.011 --> 00:14:15.490
<v Speaker 2>cultural expertise by a 10th of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent,</v>

266
00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:17.710
<v Speaker 2>a generation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like nothing,</v>

267
00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:23.460
<v Speaker 2>well run that for 7 million years at </v>
<v Speaker 2>compound interest and what happens?</v>

268
00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:25.920
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get drawn to,</v>

269
00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:27.303
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't know how much we </v>

270
00:14:29.231 --> 00:14:31.450
<v Speaker 2>transform our culture with each </v>
<v Speaker 2>generation,</v>

271
00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:32.703
<v Speaker 2>but doesn't have to be very damn much </v>
<v Speaker 2>for there to be cities after 2 million </v>

272
00:14:35.591 --> 00:14:37.030
<v Speaker 2>years of iteration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

273
00:14:37.031 --> 00:14:39.400
<v Speaker 2>chimps are still living in the jungle </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

274
00:14:39.401 --> 00:14:40.234
<v Speaker 2>They do use tools,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what seems to happen is that the </v>

275
00:14:42.821 --> 00:14:43.654
<v Speaker 2>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they do use different tools in </v>

276
00:14:45.311 --> 00:14:46.144
<v Speaker 2>different locales,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what seems to happen is that the </v>

277
00:14:48.131 --> 00:14:48.964
<v Speaker 2>environment suggests the tools to them </v>
<v Speaker 2>so they have a certain level of </v>

278
00:14:52.581 --> 00:14:57.560
<v Speaker 2>intelligence and they can figure out how</v>
<v Speaker 2>to use what's at hand and what's at hand</v>

279
00:14:57.561 --> 00:14:58.940
<v Speaker 2>is different in different places.</v>

280
00:14:58.940 --> 00:14:59.773
<v Speaker 2>So they use different tools,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't mean they're thinking </v>

281
00:15:01.521 --> 00:15:02.354
<v Speaker 2>up different tools.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not clearly because there's no </v>

282
00:15:04.851 --> 00:15:07.190
<v Speaker 2>accumulation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no accumulation of culture.</v>

283
00:15:07.191 --> 00:15:08.024
<v Speaker 2>So I don't see how you can escape from </v>
<v Speaker 2>that mathematical argument and you can </v>

284
00:15:11.661 --> 00:15:14.030
<v Speaker 2>make the same argument to pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 2>any other creature.</v>

285
00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:15.643
<v Speaker 2>Even ants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like they're making the same damn </v>

286
00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:21.410
<v Speaker 2>ant hills they were making or God only </v>
<v Speaker 2>knows how long ago.</v>

287
00:15:21.411 --> 00:15:23.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're very successful at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's,</v>

288
00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:24.433
<v Speaker 2>there's no innovation and so being the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same as the things that live before you </v>

289
00:15:28.281 --> 00:15:29.114
<v Speaker 2>that lived is a pretty good strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that isn't the human strategy or </v>

290
00:15:32.721 --> 00:15:33.554
<v Speaker 2>it's actually half the human strategy </v>
<v Speaker 2>because half our strategy is to do what </v>

291
00:15:38.241 --> 00:15:43.241
<v Speaker 2>everyone else has always done and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other half is to fix that where it's not</v>

292
00:15:43.251 --> 00:15:45.350
<v Speaker 2>working very well or at least to try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fix it.</v>

293
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:46.183
<v Speaker 2>And I think this is an excellent </v>
<v Speaker 2>representation of the abilities we have </v>

294
00:15:51.291 --> 00:15:52.124
<v Speaker 2>embodied to do precisely that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's another way of thinking about </v>

295
00:15:56.961 --> 00:15:57.794
<v Speaker 2>the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is mostly partly from Laurie again </v>

296
00:15:59.931 --> 00:16:00.764
<v Speaker 2>and the Russians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is from one of his students whose </v>

297
00:16:02.661 --> 00:16:04.010
<v Speaker 2>name is [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 2>Conan Goldberg,</v>

298
00:16:04.011 --> 00:16:06.650
<v Speaker 2>who's a practicing neuroscientist to New</v>
<v Speaker 2>York.</v>

299
00:16:06.651 --> 00:16:10.250
<v Speaker 2>And I think he's a very bright guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I like his theory because you know,</v>

300
00:16:10.251 --> 00:16:11.084
<v Speaker 2>you've heard classic theories about </v>
<v Speaker 2>linguistic versus non linguistic </v>

301
00:16:13.491 --> 00:16:14.324
<v Speaker 2>hemisphere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the the left hemisphere usually is </v>

302
00:16:16.431 --> 00:16:17.264
<v Speaker 2>regarded as the linguistic hemisphere </v>
<v Speaker 2>because in right-handed males in </v>

303
00:16:20.571 --> 00:16:21.404
<v Speaker 2>particular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>language tends to be pretty located in </v>

304
00:16:24.171 --> 00:16:25.370
<v Speaker 2>the left hemisphere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

305
00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:26.473
<v Speaker 2>what I would say instead of that is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are linguistic and non linguistic </v>

306
00:16:30.201 --> 00:16:31.034
<v Speaker 2>systems in the brain and most of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time they segregate out so that the </v>

307
00:16:36.291 --> 00:16:39.860
<v Speaker 2>linguistic system is in the left </v>
<v Speaker 2>hemisphere and the non linguistic system</v>

308
00:16:39.861 --> 00:16:43.070
<v Speaker 2>is in the right hemisphere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't have to happen that way.</v>

309
00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:46.340
<v Speaker 2>It can be reversed with people who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>left handed.</v>

310
00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:47.503
<v Speaker 2>It's more distributed in women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you lose your whole right </v>

311
00:16:50.511 --> 00:16:51.344
<v Speaker 2>hemisphere when you're like 18 months </v>
<v Speaker 2>old so you don't even have a right </v>

312
00:16:53.901 --> 00:16:54.734
<v Speaker 2>hemisphere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your left hemisphere will specialize so </v>

313
00:16:56.601 --> 00:16:59.000
<v Speaker 2>that it has the linguistic system and </v>
<v Speaker 2>unknown linguistic system.</v>

314
00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:00.373
<v Speaker 2>Partly the way to think about that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you know you're the top part of </v>

315
00:17:04.911 --> 00:17:06.410
<v Speaker 2>your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cortical cap.</v>

316
00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:11.240
<v Speaker 2>You can kind of think about that as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>plenary valence territory.</v>

317
00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:12.853
<v Speaker 2>Lots of things could happen to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what happens is that as you develop </v>

318
00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:17.413
<v Speaker 2>the underlying systems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more biologically archaic systems </v>

319
00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:23.390
<v Speaker 2>colonize the Cortex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They fight.</v>

320
00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:25.490
<v Speaker 2>They fight basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>

321
00:17:25.491 --> 00:17:26.324
<v Speaker 2>your ears in your eyes fight over which </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the back of the brain they're </v>

322
00:17:28.551 --> 00:17:29.384
<v Speaker 2>going to have access to and usually the </v>
<v Speaker 2>eyes when at the back part of the brain </v>

323
00:17:33.321 --> 00:17:35.360
<v Speaker 2>in the years when more here.</v>

324
00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:37.610
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't have any eyes,</v>

325
00:17:37.611 --> 00:17:40.160
<v Speaker 2>the ears are going to call an ice the </v>
<v Speaker 2>visual systems.</v>

326
00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:42.170
<v Speaker 2>And that's partly why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you can't see,</v>

327
00:17:42.171 --> 00:17:43.730
<v Speaker 2>you can hear better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

328
00:17:43.731 --> 00:17:44.564
<v Speaker 2>and even if you lose your hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you lose your thumb when you're </v>

329
00:17:46.911 --> 00:17:49.040
<v Speaker 2>an adult,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what'll happen is the part,</v>

330
00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:52.440
<v Speaker 2>the motor cortex that represents your </v>
<v Speaker 2>fingers will grow.</v>

331
00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:53.513
<v Speaker 2>It'll grow into that area so that these </v>
<v Speaker 2>get you have more brain now devoted </v>

332
00:17:56.521 --> 00:18:00.150
<v Speaker 2>towards these fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you're born without hands and use</v>

333
00:18:00.151 --> 00:18:00.984
<v Speaker 2>your feet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>than the feet will start to develop a </v>

334
00:18:02.851 --> 00:18:05.430
<v Speaker 2>map that looks like the map of the hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's some,</v>

335
00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:07.530
<v Speaker 2>there's some flexibility in that even in</v>
<v Speaker 2>adulthood.</v>

336
00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:08.813
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are these underlying systems that </v>

337
00:18:12.451 --> 00:18:14.700
<v Speaker 2>grow up and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

338
00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:15.570
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

339
00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:16.403
<v Speaker 2>expand their capacity for </v>
<v Speaker 2>differentiation and synthesis by </v>

340
00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:20.753
<v Speaker 2>occupying the cortex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that can happen in a variety of </v>

341
00:18:22.621 --> 00:18:23.454
<v Speaker 2>ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though it tends to happen in the </v>

342
00:18:24.541 --> 00:18:26.610
<v Speaker 2>standard way during normal development.</v>

343
00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:32.090
<v Speaker 2>So you could say it's better for your </v>
<v Speaker 2>eyes to invade the visual cortex because</v>

344
00:18:32.611 --> 00:18:35.950
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of set up for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if they can't advance,</v>

345
00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:36.803
<v Speaker 2>the visual cortex ended invades the </v>
<v Speaker 2>auditory cortex that works like 90 </v>

346
00:18:40.201 --> 00:18:42.150
<v Speaker 2>percent as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that.</v>

347
00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:43.193
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the top cortical cap is somewhat </v>

348
00:18:45.481 --> 00:18:47.490
<v Speaker 2>specialized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not.</v>

349
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:48.833
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not specialized to the degree that </v>

350
00:18:51.181 --> 00:18:54.090
<v Speaker 2>it's lost its plasticity for the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>stages of development,</v>

351
00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:55.073
<v Speaker 2>it's white child nurse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Certain neuro psychology tends to be </v>

352
00:18:56.461 --> 00:18:57.294
<v Speaker 2>such a mess is because the child's brain</v>
<v Speaker 2>is so plastic that you can't really say </v>

353
00:19:01.711 --> 00:19:05.820
<v Speaker 2>with any certainty what any given part </v>
<v Speaker 2>of it happens to be doing except down in</v>

354
00:19:05.821 --> 00:19:06.654
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

355
00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:10.200
<v Speaker 2>in the ancient areas where were some </v>
<v Speaker 2>stability has been attained.</v>

356
00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:11.633
<v Speaker 2>So here's a way of conceptualizing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference between the left and the </v>

357
00:19:14.041 --> 00:19:16.380
<v Speaker 2>right hemisphere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although again,</v>

358
00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:18.480
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't think about it that way.</v>

359
00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:22.760
<v Speaker 2>Now the classic distinction is </v>
<v Speaker 2>linguistic non-linguistic.</v>

360
00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:25.860
<v Speaker 2>Now Goldberg puts that on his head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>

361
00:19:25.861 --> 00:19:26.490
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

362
00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:30.570
<v Speaker 2>linguistic non-linguistic is an emergent</v>
<v Speaker 2>property of a more fundamental division.</v>

363
00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:31.943
<v Speaker 2>The more fundamental dee dee division is</v>
<v Speaker 2>between novelty and routine and anomaly </v>

364
00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:41.520
<v Speaker 2>and that maps onto the sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussions that we've been having.</v>

365
00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:43.380
<v Speaker 2>What do you have to deal with in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world?</v>

366
00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:48.120
<v Speaker 2>Things that work the way you think they </v>
<v Speaker 2>will and the way that you want them to,</v>

367
00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:52.440
<v Speaker 2>and then things that don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you have a system that works with the</v>

368
00:19:52.441 --> 00:19:54.780
<v Speaker 2>things that work the way you want them </v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

369
00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:55.703
<v Speaker 2>and you have another system that deals </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the things that don't and roughly </v>

370
00:19:58.891 --> 00:19:59.724
<v Speaker 2>speaking in the standard human brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The right hemisphere seems to be wired </v>

371
00:20:04.051 --> 00:20:07.860
<v Speaker 2>for normal novelty detection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>emotional response,</v>

372
00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:08.873
<v Speaker 2>and provisional processing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas the left hemisphere seems to be </v>

373
00:20:12.091 --> 00:20:16.650
<v Speaker 2>specialized for routinized activities </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that would include representation in</v>

374
00:20:16.651 --> 00:20:17.484
<v Speaker 2>language.</v>

375
00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:19.260
<v Speaker 2>Now what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

376
00:20:19.261 --> 00:20:22.050
<v Speaker 2>if you practice a novel task,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that when you first do it,</v>

377
00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:27.450
<v Speaker 2>it's very computationally demanding and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so you set out a lot of energy and a lot</v>

378
00:20:27.451 --> 00:20:28.284
<v Speaker 2>of your brain is at work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in the right hemisphere and </v>

379
00:20:30.691 --> 00:20:31.524
<v Speaker 2>as you practice it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the right hemisphere stops working and </v>

380
00:20:34.051 --> 00:20:34.884
<v Speaker 2>the left hemisphere works more and more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then a big part of the left </v>

381
00:20:37.231 --> 00:20:39.570
<v Speaker 2>hemisphere works and then as you keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>practicing it,</v>

382
00:20:39.571 --> 00:20:40.404
<v Speaker 2>that moves back until there's little </v>
<v Speaker 2>tiny part of your brain that's really </v>

383
00:20:43.771 --> 00:20:45.930
<v Speaker 2>active when you're doing it and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>good at it,</v>

384
00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:49.330
<v Speaker 2>and so partly what happens is imagine it</v>
<v Speaker 2>this way,</v>

385
00:20:49.331 --> 00:20:51.430
<v Speaker 2>is your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you're first trying to do something</v>

386
00:20:51.431 --> 00:20:52.264
<v Speaker 2>complex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's maybe you're trying a new piano </v>

387
00:20:54.281 --> 00:20:56.350
<v Speaker 2>piece or maybe you're doing some </v>
<v Speaker 2>improvisation.</v>

388
00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:58.630
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're trying out all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

389
00:20:58.631 --> 00:20:59.464
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of it's error and error </v>

390
00:21:00.101 --> 00:21:00.610
<v Speaker 2>correction.</v>

391
00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:02.200
<v Speaker 2>It's a bloody mess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's exhausting.</v>

392
00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:03.363
<v Speaker 2>You're doing all this and you're getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>rid of that thing that doesn't work in </v>

393
00:21:05.471 --> 00:21:07.870
<v Speaker 2>that thing and you really practice this </v>
<v Speaker 2>part that's awkward,</v>

394
00:21:07.871 --> 00:21:11.590
<v Speaker 2>and as you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are fewer and fewer errors.</v>

395
00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:15.160
<v Speaker 2>Less variability and more and more </v>
<v Speaker 2>routinized,</v>

396
00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:16.473
<v Speaker 2>and as you're doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're building a little machine at the </v>

397
00:21:18.071 --> 00:21:20.710
<v Speaker 2>back of your head that does this </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfectly,</v>

398
00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:23.530
<v Speaker 2>but that Rita can't do anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

399
00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:24.423
<v Speaker 2>that's really an interesting thing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>think about because what it implies is </v>

400
00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:29.853
<v Speaker 2>whatever you practice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you build into your implicit processing </v>

401
00:21:34.271 --> 00:21:35.104
<v Speaker 2>systems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so be careful what you practice because </v>

402
00:21:38.531 --> 00:21:39.364
<v Speaker 2>once you get one of those little </v>
<v Speaker 2>machines back there and it really knows </v>

403
00:21:41.441 --> 00:21:43.300
<v Speaker 2>what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's there.</v>

404
00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:44.523
<v Speaker 2>Now you could build another little </v>
<v Speaker 2>machine that stops it from doing what </v>

405
00:21:46.781 --> 00:21:47.614
<v Speaker 2>it's doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's pretty damn hard to get rid of </v>

406
00:21:49.301 --> 00:21:50.710
<v Speaker 2>that machine once you've built it.</v>

407
00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:55.710
<v Speaker 2>And so if you build it cocaine consuming</v>
<v Speaker 2>and desiring machine in your head,</v>

408
00:21:57.610 --> 00:22:00.640
<v Speaker 2>that machine might end up being more </v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful than you are,</v>

409
00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:05.230
<v Speaker 2>in which case you're basically ruined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's really what happens to people</v>

410
00:22:05.231 --> 00:22:06.064
<v Speaker 2>who are addicted because they build </v>
<v Speaker 2>expertise in cocaine seeking and </v>

411
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:10.833
<v Speaker 2>preparation and ingestion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's really a powerful system </v>

412
00:22:14.381 --> 00:22:17.350
<v Speaker 2>because it gets hit by dopamine every </v>
<v Speaker 2>time it's successful,</v>

413
00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:21.850
<v Speaker 2>so it grows into this like monstrous </v>
<v Speaker 2>subpersonality and all that.</v>

414
00:22:21.851 --> 00:22:23.980
<v Speaker 2>You need to activate that </v>
<v Speaker 2>subpersonality,</v>

415
00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:24.933
<v Speaker 2>even if it's been dormant for a long </v>
<v Speaker 2>period of time and you know you're out </v>

416
00:22:27.581 --> 00:22:31.270
<v Speaker 2>of the addiction is the site of </v>
<v Speaker 2>something associated with cocaine.</v>

417
00:22:31.271 --> 00:22:34.510
<v Speaker 2>It's like up at comes and you're under </v>
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>

418
00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:36.550
<v Speaker 2>That's the monkey on your back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>

419
00:22:36.551 --> 00:22:37.384
<v Speaker 2>And so what happens when you're trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get people on addicted is that you </v>

420
00:22:40.871 --> 00:22:44.920
<v Speaker 2>can take them to a treatment center and </v>
<v Speaker 2>let them go through all the minor league</v>

421
00:22:44.921 --> 00:22:45.754
<v Speaker 2>horrors of withdrawal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are nowhere near as bad as people </v>

422
00:22:48.881 --> 00:22:49.720
<v Speaker 2>generally claim.</v>

423
00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:53.320
<v Speaker 2>So like heroin withdrawal is like a very</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad flu for about four days.</v>

424
00:22:53.321 --> 00:22:57.070
<v Speaker 2>It's not exactly pleasant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not like alcohol withdrawal,</v>

425
00:22:57.071 --> 00:22:57.904
<v Speaker 2>which just kills you often.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you let the person get through all </v>

426
00:23:01.391 --> 00:23:02.224
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're no longer dependent on the </v>

427
00:23:03.341 --> 00:23:06.790
<v Speaker 2>chemical and they're fine as long as </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're in the treatment center,</v>

428
00:23:06.791 --> 00:23:07.624
<v Speaker 2>but as soon as you put them back in </v>
<v Speaker 2>their environment and they see like </v>

429
00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:12.550
<v Speaker 2>their friend Joe who's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

430
00:23:12.551 --> 00:23:15.370
<v Speaker 2>they're drinking and cocaine partners </v>
<v Speaker 2>like poof.</v>

431
00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:18.940
<v Speaker 2>Up comes the monster and they're gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's very,</v>

432
00:23:18.941 --> 00:23:22.420
<v Speaker 2>very difficult to treat addictions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's because an addiction is not a</v>

433
00:23:22.421 --> 00:23:23.254
<v Speaker 2>psychological thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like you built a real monster in </v>

434
00:23:26.471 --> 00:23:27.304
<v Speaker 2>your head and the pro and you're going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to have to like bore him to death over </v>

435
00:23:32.501 --> 00:23:35.080
<v Speaker 2>years before it goes away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

436
00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:36.023
<v Speaker 2>and then if you're stressed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's going to make it even more </v>

437
00:23:38.411 --> 00:23:40.990
<v Speaker 2>difficult for you to inhibit it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And well,</v>

438
00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:42.820
<v Speaker 2>it's a bloody mess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a mess.</v>

439
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:43.833
<v Speaker 2>Or if you get money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like the worst thing that can </v>

440
00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:46.580
<v Speaker 2>happen to you if your dad dicked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

441
00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:47.443
<v Speaker 2>it's like</v>

442
00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:49.783
<v Speaker 2>I've had addicts as clients and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>worst thing that ever happens to the MS </v>

443
00:23:51.911 --> 00:23:52.744
<v Speaker 2>dot payday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like they're going on payday for </v>

444
00:23:54.681 --> 00:23:56.900
<v Speaker 2>like three days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're gone and then they come back and</v>

445
00:23:56.901 --> 00:23:59.620
<v Speaker 2>they're all beat to death because they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

446
00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:01.520
<v Speaker 2>they've screwed up horribly and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>broke.</v>

447
00:24:01.521 --> 00:24:03.980
<v Speaker 2>And so then they're safe till the next </v>
<v Speaker 2>time they get some money.</v>

448
00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:05.203
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these are the sorts of associations </v>

449
00:24:06.831 --> 00:24:10.730
<v Speaker 2>that go along with the novelty versus </v>
<v Speaker 2>root and ization model of the brain.</v>

450
00:24:10.731 --> 00:24:12.320
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it is,</v>

451
00:24:12.321 --> 00:24:14.450
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right versus left roughly.</v>

452
00:24:14.451 --> 00:24:16.100
<v Speaker 2>But it's better to think of it the other</v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

453
00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:16.993
<v Speaker 2>Novelty versus routinized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so the novelty processing part of </v>

454
00:24:20.121 --> 00:24:23.510
<v Speaker 2>the brain is responsible for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>production of negative emotion.</v>

455
00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:25.820
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

456
00:24:25.821 --> 00:24:27.770
<v Speaker 2>when you run into something that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't expect,</v>

457
00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:29.173
<v Speaker 2>you should immediately be cautious </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's something that you don't </v>

458
00:24:31.401 --> 00:24:32.420
<v Speaker 2>want might happen to you.</v>

459
00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:35.240
<v Speaker 2>Now you can be excited because maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>something new will happen,</v>

460
00:24:35.241 --> 00:24:36.074
<v Speaker 2>but the but the prudent thing to do is </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be on alert first because God only </v>

461
00:24:42.381 --> 00:24:45.530
<v Speaker 2>knows where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So negative effect is part of it.</v>

462
00:24:45.531 --> 00:24:47.870
<v Speaker 2>The thing you don't understand is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>threat.</v>

463
00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:50.930
<v Speaker 2>That's the initial presumption and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>prudent.</v>

464
00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:54.710
<v Speaker 2>And then the other thing the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>hemisphere does is it stops your ongoing</v>

465
00:24:54.711 --> 00:24:56.120
<v Speaker 2>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does.</v>

466
00:24:56.930 --> 00:25:01.610
<v Speaker 2>I would think about it as doing low </v>
<v Speaker 2>resolution hypothesis generation.</v>

467
00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:04.610
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're alone at night,</v>

468
00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:06.290
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

469
00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:08.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you've watched a horror movie,</v>

470
00:25:08.091 --> 00:25:08.924
<v Speaker 2>so you've got yourself nice and primed </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's like one in the morning and </v>

471
00:25:11.601 --> 00:25:12.434
<v Speaker 2>you're tired and you haven't eaten </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything for awhile and you hear some </v>

472
00:25:14.451 --> 00:25:15.284
<v Speaker 2>weird noise in a room upstairs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Images are going to flash through your </v>

473
00:25:18.231 --> 00:25:19.064
<v Speaker 2>head and they're basically hypotheses </v>
<v Speaker 2>about what might be up there and you </v>

474
00:25:23.481 --> 00:25:24.314
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can take bizarre form like </v>

475
00:25:25.391 --> 00:25:26.990
<v Speaker 2>especially if you've been watching a </v>
<v Speaker 2>horror movie,</v>

476
00:25:26.991 --> 00:25:28.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God only knows what you said,</v>

477
00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:32.730
<v Speaker 2>some serial killer with like a hockey </v>
<v Speaker 2>mask up there or something you know,</v>

478
00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:35.840
<v Speaker 2>but what your right hemisphere do is </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing is a very rapid,</v>

479
00:25:35.841 --> 00:25:40.380
<v Speaker 2>quick and dirty processing of what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>horrible thing might be and that,</v>

480
00:25:40.381 --> 00:25:41.214
<v Speaker 2>that you're on alert and you need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of know what might be there and so </v>

481
00:25:44.361 --> 00:25:45.194
<v Speaker 2>you over you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you overestimate might be the worst </v>

482
00:25:47.151 --> 00:25:48.170
<v Speaker 2>thing you can imagine.</v>

483
00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:52.550
<v Speaker 2>And that freeze you like a rat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if nothing else happens,</v>

484
00:25:52.551 --> 00:25:53.384
<v Speaker 2>then well maybe it'll hide under the bed</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you know might be a useful </v>

485
00:25:56.751 --> 00:25:57.584
<v Speaker 2>solution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or probably you'll like walk upstairs </v>

486
00:26:00.141 --> 00:26:00.974
<v Speaker 2>and see what happens as you walk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if nothing comes leaping out and </v>

487
00:26:03.501 --> 00:26:05.270
<v Speaker 2>killing you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you'll think,</v>

488
00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:06.403
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's at least not the sort of monster </v>

489
00:26:08.031 --> 00:26:10.670
<v Speaker 2>that leaps out and kills you when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>were walking up the stairs in the dark.</v>

490
00:26:10.910 --> 00:26:11.743
<v Speaker 2>And so you're narrowing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're developing a higher and higher </v>

491
00:26:13.791 --> 00:26:16.280
<v Speaker 2>resolution model of the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you know,</v>

492
00:26:16.281 --> 00:26:18.410
<v Speaker 2>you go upstairs and you'll find that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

493
00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:22.370
<v Speaker 2>maybe your cat knocked a stuffed animal </v>
<v Speaker 2>onto the floor or something,</v>

494
00:26:22.371 --> 00:26:24.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it narrows it down to irrelevancy,</v>

495
00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:25.843
<v Speaker 2>but your right hemisphere is going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing the initial quick and dirty </v>

496
00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:29.353
<v Speaker 2>processing and those are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are low resolution </v>

497
00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:34.160
<v Speaker 2>representations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're often archetipal,</v>

498
00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:35.673
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like</v>

499
00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:41.160
<v Speaker 2>things that go bump in the night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's a big category?</v>

500
00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:42.541
<v Speaker 2>And you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

501
00:26:42.541 --> 00:26:45.570
<v Speaker 2>is that a category?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's a reasonable category.</v>

502
00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:46.703
<v Speaker 2>Things in the night that might hurt you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the category of monsters </v>

503
00:26:49.441 --> 00:26:51.210
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

504
00:26:51.390 --> 00:26:52.440
<v Speaker 2>and you know what you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

505
00:26:52.441 --> 00:26:53.274
<v Speaker 2>there's no such thing as monsters while </v>
<v Speaker 2>we already went through that with the </v>

506
00:26:55.411 --> 00:26:56.370
<v Speaker 2>little book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't we?</v>

507
00:26:56.400 --> 00:27:01.400
<v Speaker 2>So of course there are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a low resolution category,</v>

508
00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:04.043
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

509
00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:09.090
<v Speaker 2>But that doesn't mean it isn't useful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Larger Motor actions are associated with</v>

510
00:27:09.091 --> 00:27:11.490
<v Speaker 2>the part of the brain that does novelty </v>
<v Speaker 2>processing.</v>

511
00:27:11.491 --> 00:27:13.170
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of low resolution,</v>

512
00:27:13.171 --> 00:27:14.670
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because when you really figure something</v>

513
00:27:14.671 --> 00:27:17.340
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can fiddle around with it in detail,</v>

514
00:27:17.341 --> 00:27:19.860
<v Speaker 2>but if you're reacting in a quick and </v>
<v Speaker 2>dirty manner,</v>

515
00:27:19.861 --> 00:27:24.861
<v Speaker 2>you're using your whole body so and on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the on the route and ization side of the</v>

516
00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:29.100
<v Speaker 2>equation.</v>

517
00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:29.933
<v Speaker 2>You've got positive emotion moving </v>
<v Speaker 2>forward because it's much more </v>

518
00:27:33.421 --> 00:27:34.254
<v Speaker 2>appropriate to move forward and fully </v>
<v Speaker 2>articulated territory because you know </v>

519
00:27:37.381 --> 00:27:38.214
<v Speaker 2>what you're doing and so if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand the territory and you've </v>

520
00:27:40.621 --> 00:27:41.454
<v Speaker 2>articulated it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the probability that you're going </v>

521
00:27:43.341 --> 00:27:44.174
<v Speaker 2>to get what you want when you're there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be very high word </v>

522
00:27:46.771 --> 00:27:48.240
<v Speaker 2>processing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>linear thinking,</v>

523
00:27:48.241 --> 00:27:50.460
<v Speaker 2>detailed recognition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>detail generation,</v>

524
00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:51.473
<v Speaker 2>fine motor action.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The actual physiological structure of </v>

525
00:27:54.241 --> 00:27:55.074
<v Speaker 2>the left hemisphere is more </v>
<v Speaker 2>differentiated than the physiological </v>

526
00:27:57.211 --> 00:27:58.740
<v Speaker 2>structure of the right hemisphere as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

527
00:27:58.980 --> 00:27:59.813
<v Speaker 2>and I want another way to think about it</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think is that the novelty processing </v>

528
00:28:04.201 --> 00:28:06.180
<v Speaker 2>unit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is non linguistic,</v>

529
00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:09.450
<v Speaker 2>is actually under the control of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>underlying limit.</v>

530
00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:12.780
<v Speaker 2>LIMBIC and hypothalamic systems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's bottom up.</v>

531
00:28:12.781 --> 00:28:15.780
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of the part of your brain that</v>
<v Speaker 2>still acts like an animal act.</v>

532
00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:19.410
<v Speaker 2>Whereas the linguistic part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's sort of the you that you think of</v>

533
00:28:19.411 --> 00:28:20.370
<v Speaker 2>yourself as.</v>

534
00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:21.443
<v Speaker 2>That's where the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking that the ego that's </v>

535
00:28:24.241 --> 00:28:25.074
<v Speaker 2>talking to itself resides and I think it</v>
<v Speaker 2>is capable of top down control to a </v>

536
00:28:30.391 --> 00:28:33.600
<v Speaker 2>larger degree than a novelty processing </v>
<v Speaker 2>unit,</v>

537
00:28:33.601 --> 00:28:34.434
<v Speaker 2>which is still working as a quick and </v>
<v Speaker 2>dirty defense system and is highly </v>

538
00:28:39.571 --> 00:28:43.290
<v Speaker 2>motivated by more primordial systems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how.</v>

539
00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:44.143
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's another way of thinking about </v>

540
00:28:45.031 --> 00:28:45.864
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

541
00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:47.813
<v Speaker 2>we can zero in a little bit more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's been a lot of work on a brain </v>

542
00:28:50.311 --> 00:28:51.144
<v Speaker 2>area called the hippocampus and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hippocampus is the part of the brain </v>

543
00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:58.880
<v Speaker 2>that moves information from short term </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention to longterm storage.</v>

544
00:28:59.870 --> 00:29:04.170
<v Speaker 2>It seems to do that across time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

545
00:29:04.171 --> 00:29:09.171
<v Speaker 2>if you suffer a maybe impact induced </v>
<v Speaker 2>amnesia,</v>

546
00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:10.523
<v Speaker 2>a little bit of oxygen deprivation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hippocampus was a very active part </v>

547
00:29:13.531 --> 00:29:15.720
<v Speaker 2>of the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it doesn't like being deprived of</v>

548
00:29:15.721 --> 00:29:16.554
<v Speaker 2>oxygen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if you have brain trauma and you </v>

549
00:29:18.341 --> 00:29:20.700
<v Speaker 2>get oxygen deprived,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll damage the hippocampus.</v>

550
00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:23.790
<v Speaker 2>And then what often happens is you can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember the accident.</v>

551
00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:27.030
<v Speaker 2>You can't remember what happened for six</v>
<v Speaker 2>months before the accident.</v>

552
00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:29.820
<v Speaker 2>Your memory over the last 18 months is </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty hazy,</v>

553
00:29:29.821 --> 00:29:30.654
<v Speaker 2>but the farther back you go in time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more likely you are to have access </v>

554
00:29:34.801 --> 00:29:35.634
<v Speaker 2>to the memories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what seems to happen is the </v>

555
00:29:37.291 --> 00:29:40.080
<v Speaker 2>hippocampus seems to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does a bunch of things.</v>

556
00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:42.930
<v Speaker 2>It moves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

557
00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:44.003
<v Speaker 2>It probably organizes your </v>
<v Speaker 2>autobiographical information initially </v>

558
00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:49.593
<v Speaker 2>and then as it's elaborated in memory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it moves up into critical </v>

559
00:29:52.601 --> 00:29:53.434
<v Speaker 2>representations and becomes more </v>
<v Speaker 2>permanent and maybe articulation has </v>

560
00:29:57.221 --> 00:30:00.730
<v Speaker 2>something to do with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I have a suspicion that partly what</v>

561
00:30:00.731 --> 00:30:01.564
<v Speaker 2>you're doing when you're doing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>writing that you already did is you're </v>

562
00:30:03.941 --> 00:30:04.774
<v Speaker 2>moving information more and more </v>
<v Speaker 2>permanently into cortical </v>

563
00:30:08.261 --> 00:30:12.070
<v Speaker 2>representation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cortical semantic representation.</v>

564
00:30:12.071 --> 00:30:15.820
<v Speaker 2>You're detaching it from its underlying </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotional substrate,</v>

565
00:30:16.210 --> 00:30:18.520
<v Speaker 2>so the hippocampus seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsible for that.</v>

566
00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:19.353
<v Speaker 2>So if you take people whose hippocampus </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's two of them have been </v>

567
00:30:21.761 --> 00:30:24.790
<v Speaker 2>destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are a few clinical case reports of</v>

568
00:30:24.791 --> 00:30:25.624
<v Speaker 2>people like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't develop any new </v>

569
00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:28.953
<v Speaker 2>autobiographical memory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the famous most famous of those </v>

570
00:30:31.211 --> 00:30:32.044
<v Speaker 2>patients was a guy named h,</v>
<v Speaker 2>m who had bilateral hippocampus damage </v>

571
00:30:35.231 --> 00:30:37.420
<v Speaker 2>partly from surgery and partly from </v>
<v Speaker 2>epilepsy,</v>

572
00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:38.493
<v Speaker 2>and he was stuck in 1957 for 40 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He couldn't even really recognize </v>

573
00:30:42.791 --> 00:30:43.624
<v Speaker 2>himself in a mirror because it was like </v>
<v Speaker 2>the old him and although he could learn </v>

574
00:30:47.321 --> 00:30:50.830
<v Speaker 2>new procedures quite well as well as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>normal person,</v>

575
00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:54.550
<v Speaker 2>he so he could learn a new procedure by </v>
<v Speaker 2>practicing it day after day.</v>

576
00:30:54.551 --> 00:30:56.620
<v Speaker 2>But if you showed them the thing he </v>
<v Speaker 2>learned,</v>

577
00:30:56.621 --> 00:30:58.090
<v Speaker 2>he'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never saw that before,</v>

578
00:30:58.091 --> 00:30:58.924
<v Speaker 2>even though he got much better at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he was one of the first cases </v>

579
00:31:01.991 --> 00:31:04.240
<v Speaker 2>that showed that memory systems were </v>
<v Speaker 2>dissociable.</v>

580
00:31:04.690 --> 00:31:07.540
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hippocampus is a big deal now.</v>

581
00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:12.340
<v Speaker 2>The Russian neuropsychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>solar carve and vinegar Dov [inaudible],</v>

582
00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:17.200
<v Speaker 2>followed by Jeffrey Gray,</v>
<v Speaker 2>followed up on this cybernetic model via</v>

583
00:31:17.201 --> 00:31:21.370
<v Speaker 2>Luria and they came up with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hypothesis that what the hippocampus was</v>

584
00:31:21.371 --> 00:31:22.204
<v Speaker 2>doing was comparing what you expected to</v>
<v Speaker 2>happen in the world with what was </v>

585
00:31:26.831 --> 00:31:28.270
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

586
00:31:28.271 --> 00:31:29.104
<v Speaker 2>So it's an expectation based model.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea was because they were </v>

587
00:31:31.961 --> 00:31:32.794
<v Speaker 2>behaviorists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea was there are stimuli in the </v>

588
00:31:34.961 --> 00:31:37.000
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're actually there,</v>

589
00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:38.163
<v Speaker 2>you're monitoring them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a sense of what's going to </v>

590
00:31:40.301 --> 00:31:42.400
<v Speaker 2>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a cognitive expectation,</v>

591
00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:46.150
<v Speaker 2>and as long as the two things are </v>
<v Speaker 2>occurring,</v>

592
00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:47.673
<v Speaker 2>then your emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly your threat response is </v>

593
00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:53.823
<v Speaker 2>inhibited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the threat system is sort of always </v>

594
00:31:57.431 --> 00:31:58.264
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as long as everything is happening </v>

595
00:31:59.861 --> 00:32:02.980
<v Speaker 2>the way you expect it to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's inhibited.</v>

596
00:32:02.981 --> 00:32:04.150
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way it's inhibited,</v>

597
00:32:04.151 --> 00:32:04.984
<v Speaker 2>it seems to be at something like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a part of the brain that's very </v>

598
00:32:09.161 --> 00:32:09.994
<v Speaker 2>deep called the reticular activating </v>
<v Speaker 2>system and the reticular activating </v>

599
00:32:12.161 --> 00:32:15.700
<v Speaker 2>system is an ascending stream of of </v>
<v Speaker 2>neuronal connections,</v>

600
00:32:15.701 --> 00:32:16.534
<v Speaker 2>and if you're in a car accident and </v>
<v Speaker 2>twist your head and you snap that </v>

601
00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:20.860
<v Speaker 2>tracked because it's.</v>

602
00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:23.140
<v Speaker 2>It's quite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually fairly fragile.</v>

603
00:32:23.410 --> 00:32:26.620
<v Speaker 2>Then your unconscious forever and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

604
00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:27.813
<v Speaker 2>So it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very important track and it seems to be </v>

605
00:32:30.641 --> 00:32:31.474
<v Speaker 2>governing arousal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What governs your emergence into </v>

606
00:32:34.271 --> 00:32:36.940
<v Speaker 2>consciousness and your dissenting to </v>
<v Speaker 2>unconsciousness at night.</v>

607
00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:38.080
<v Speaker 2>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

608
00:32:38.081 --> 00:32:42.290
<v Speaker 2>very old brain system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it is.</v>

609
00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:45.800
<v Speaker 2>What it seems to happen is that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hippocampus detects a mismatch.</v>

610
00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:47.563
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's tonically inhibiting the reticular </v>

611
00:32:49.641 --> 00:32:50.474
<v Speaker 2>activating system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so as long as everything is going </v>

612
00:32:52.371 --> 00:32:53.204
<v Speaker 2>according to expectation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reticular activating system isn't </v>

613
00:32:55.941 --> 00:32:56.774
<v Speaker 2>sending a message to the Amygdala and </v>
<v Speaker 2>other systems that are primarily </v>

614
00:32:59.901 --> 00:33:00.734
<v Speaker 2>associated with emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not sending a signal to them </v>

615
00:33:03.201 --> 00:33:04.700
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wake the hell up,</v>

616
00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:05.983
<v Speaker 2>but as soon as there's a mismatch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the hippocampus inhibition of the </v>

617
00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:11.563
<v Speaker 2>reticular activating system declines and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Amygdala and other emotional </v>

618
00:33:15.051 --> 00:33:17.840
<v Speaker 2>systems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>motivational systems as well turn on,</v>

619
00:33:18.650 --> 00:33:19.483
<v Speaker 2>so or are or are no longer inhibited,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a better way of thinking about </v>

620
00:33:22.431 --> 00:33:23.420
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

621
00:33:23.421 --> 00:33:27.830
<v Speaker 2>so now the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when gray,</v>

622
00:33:27.831 --> 00:33:28.664
<v Speaker 2>who is also one of the cybernetic </v>
<v Speaker 2>theorists talks about what happens when </v>

623
00:33:31.611 --> 00:33:32.444
<v Speaker 2>you hit something that's unexpected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He basically says you have to revamp </v>

624
00:33:36.861 --> 00:33:37.694
<v Speaker 2>your motor programs and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>expectations of the future in order to </v>

625
00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:43.813
<v Speaker 2>reconcile the error and that that's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>complex process and it requires </v>

626
00:33:47.601 --> 00:33:51.350
<v Speaker 2>exploration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the problem with that theory is</v>

627
00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:54.513
<v Speaker 2>you don't have access to the present.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a model of the present and you </v>

628
00:33:59.711 --> 00:34:04.570
<v Speaker 2>don't expect things to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want them to happen and so what that</v>

629
00:34:04.571 --> 00:34:07.480
<v Speaker 2>means is if they don't happen the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>you want them to,</v>

630
00:34:07.630 --> 00:34:08.463
<v Speaker 2>you have a bigger problem than the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cognitive cybernetic theorists </v>

631
00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:13.413
<v Speaker 2>originally envisioned and the problem is</v>
<v Speaker 2>the place where the error might be is </v>

632
00:34:18.671 --> 00:34:21.280
<v Speaker 2>way bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be in what you want.</v>

633
00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:22.413
<v Speaker 2>It might be in how you put together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you want with the other things you </v>

634
00:34:24.671 --> 00:34:25.504
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be how you put together all </v>

635
00:34:26.861 --> 00:34:28.690
<v Speaker 2>those things with what other people </v>
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>

636
00:34:28.990 --> 00:34:29.823
<v Speaker 2>It might be something wrong with your </v>
<v Speaker 2>conception of your abilities at the </v>

637
00:34:32.141 --> 00:34:35.500
<v Speaker 2>present time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be a skill deficit and it might</v>

638
00:34:35.501 --> 00:34:38.860
<v Speaker 2>be something that's gone astray with </v>
<v Speaker 2>your conceptualization of the future,</v>

639
00:34:38.990 --> 00:34:42.510
<v Speaker 2>how it's a big search space and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's part of the reason.</v>

640
00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:43.360
<v Speaker 2>So you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

641
00:34:43.361 --> 00:34:46.870
<v Speaker 2>what should you do when you hit </v>
<v Speaker 2>something you don't expect?</v>

642
00:34:46.871 --> 00:34:51.100
<v Speaker 2>And the answer to that is you default to</v>
<v Speaker 2>emergency preparation.</v>

643
00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:54.430
<v Speaker 2>Now how much do you default?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

644
00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:55.293
<v Speaker 2>we don't quite understand the rat </v>
<v Speaker 2>representation yet because it's </v>

645
00:34:57.551 --> 00:35:00.340
<v Speaker 2>associated with this hierarchical </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem we already described.</v>

646
00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:04.060
<v Speaker 2>So I think it's got to be something like</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

647
00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:08.733
<v Speaker 2>Your brain must be able to tell somehow </v>
<v Speaker 2>how much of it's structure is dependent </v>

648
00:35:13.871 --> 00:35:17.140
<v Speaker 2>on a given on the viability of a given </v>
<v Speaker 2>node,</v>

649
00:35:17.590 --> 00:35:18.423
<v Speaker 2>so so imagine that you have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>representation and hardly anything </v>

650
00:35:21.821 --> 00:35:26.200
<v Speaker 2>depends on that representation and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>representation is disrupted.</v>

651
00:35:26.201 --> 00:35:26.761
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

652
00:35:26.761 --> 00:35:30.610
<v Speaker 2>that's no big deal because it's only </v>
<v Speaker 2>knocking out a part of what you're using</v>

653
00:35:30.611 --> 00:35:31.444
<v Speaker 2>to orient yourself in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if it's a fundamental </v>

654
00:35:33.850 --> 00:35:36.010
<v Speaker 2>presupposition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe like the presence,</v>

655
00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:36.883
<v Speaker 2>the continued presence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a loved one on which all your other </v>

656
00:35:39.691 --> 00:35:40.524
<v Speaker 2>plans are predicated because you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine that sort of as a neural </v>

657
00:35:42.691 --> 00:35:43.524
<v Speaker 2>structure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's way down at the bottom and the </v>

658
00:35:45.631 --> 00:35:50.070
<v Speaker 2>neural structure is branching off from </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and that gets disrupted.</v>

659
00:35:50.071 --> 00:35:50.904
<v Speaker 2>It looks like that the hippocampal </v>
<v Speaker 2>septal system has some ability to sense </v>

660
00:35:55.530 --> 00:36:00.240
<v Speaker 2>the degree to which a given </v>
<v Speaker 2>conceptualization is fundamental and the</v>

661
00:36:00.241 --> 00:36:04.140
<v Speaker 2>maybe that has something to do with how </v>
<v Speaker 2>early in life it was laid down.</v>

662
00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:05.371
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you,</v>

663
00:36:05.371 --> 00:36:06.204
<v Speaker 2>you know that once you make a </v>
<v Speaker 2>presupposition in childhood to Orient </v>

664
00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:11.573
<v Speaker 2>Yourself than other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more finely grained presuppositions are </v>

665
00:36:13.711 --> 00:36:14.544
<v Speaker 2>going to emerge from that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe it has something to do with </v>

666
00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:19.490
<v Speaker 2>depth of representation in the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

667
00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:20.603
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or the branching or the are account of </v>

668
00:36:23.671 --> 00:36:27.180
<v Speaker 2>the branches that come off that I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know and I don't think anybody does,</v>

669
00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:30.570
<v Speaker 2>but there has to be an association of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that sort.</v>

670
00:36:30.571 --> 00:36:31.404
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

671
00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:37.133
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you one thing that's been </v>

672
00:36:38.101 --> 00:36:38.934
<v Speaker 2>done about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is the kind of science that </v>

673
00:36:41.551 --> 00:36:42.384
<v Speaker 2>people hate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You may or may not know that I'm </v>

674
00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:46.463
<v Speaker 2>Ashkenazi Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 2>European Jews on average have an Iq </v>

675
00:36:50.401 --> 00:36:54.270
<v Speaker 2>that's about 15 points higher than the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rest of the Caucasian population.</v>

676
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:55.463
<v Speaker 2>And that's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's part of the reason why </v>

677
00:36:57.571 --> 00:37:00.090
<v Speaker 2>they're massively overrepresented,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

678
00:37:00.091 --> 00:37:02.730
<v Speaker 2>among,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well among people in most high level,</v>

679
00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:04.920
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>occupations,</v>

680
00:37:04.921 --> 00:37:05.754
<v Speaker 2>but among Nobel prize winners and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're also much more prone to neural </v>

681
00:37:09.241 --> 00:37:11.790
<v Speaker 2>diseases that are associated with </v>
<v Speaker 2>hypergrowth.</v>

682
00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:17.820
<v Speaker 2>So the fact that their brains are more </v>
<v Speaker 2>plastic in some sense,</v>

683
00:37:17.821 --> 00:37:18.654
<v Speaker 2>comes along with susceptibility to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>variety of diseases of the nervous </v>

684
00:37:21.481 --> 00:37:23.220
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>

685
00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:25.990
<v Speaker 2>so there's an intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

686
00:37:26.130 --> 00:37:30.350
<v Speaker 2>proliferation problem there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your brain can be so plastic that it,</v>

687
00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:33.090
<v Speaker 2>it starts to become abnormal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

688
00:37:33.330 --> 00:37:37.170
<v Speaker 2>so we also know with regards to openness</v>
<v Speaker 2>per say,</v>

689
00:37:38.250 --> 00:37:39.083
<v Speaker 2>that one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's one of the best tests for </v>

690
00:37:40.321 --> 00:37:41.920
<v Speaker 2>openness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could do this right now.</v>

691
00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:44.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if I say,</v>

692
00:37:44.311 --> 00:37:45.144
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take out a piece of paper and a pen and </v>

693
00:37:47.251 --> 00:37:48.084
<v Speaker 2>write down as many words as you can that</v>
<v Speaker 2>begin with the letter s in three </v>

694
00:37:50.041 --> 00:37:50.874
<v Speaker 2>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's gonna be a lot of variation in </v>

695
00:37:52.651 --> 00:37:53.484
<v Speaker 2>this group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would think it would be from 50 to </v>

696
00:37:54.691 --> 00:37:56.760
<v Speaker 2>200.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

697
00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:58.920
<v Speaker 2>the people who can write down more </v>
<v Speaker 2>words,</v>

698
00:37:59.430 --> 00:38:01.860
<v Speaker 2>they're higher in openness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're more creative as well,</v>

699
00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:03.540
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a pretty good predictor.</v>

700
00:38:04.170 --> 00:38:09.170
<v Speaker 2>So that isn't so much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think an indication necessarily of the</v>

701
00:38:09.241 --> 00:38:10.074
<v Speaker 2>complexity of the branches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's certainly an indication how </v>

702
00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:16.650
<v Speaker 2>rapidly you can access the information </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's in those branches.</v>

703
00:38:17.370 --> 00:38:18.930
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

704
00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:19.823
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's how you maintained emotional </v>

705
00:38:25.201 --> 00:38:26.034
<v Speaker 2>stability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way you intend emotional stability </v>

706
00:38:27.841 --> 00:38:31.560
<v Speaker 2>is something like you have a conception </v>
<v Speaker 2>of how the world should lay itself out.</v>

707
00:38:31.561 --> 00:38:32.394
<v Speaker 2>When you act as long as that conception </v>
<v Speaker 2>and your model of what's happening </v>

708
00:38:37.091 --> 00:38:37.924
<v Speaker 2>match.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then your hippocampus tells your </v>

709
00:38:39.581 --> 00:38:40.414
<v Speaker 2>reticular activation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reticular activating system to leave </v>

710
00:38:43.841 --> 00:38:46.270
<v Speaker 2>your motivational and emotional systems </v>
<v Speaker 2>dormant,</v>

711
00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:51.490
<v Speaker 2>and then if there's a mismatch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like it's time to wake the hell up</v>

712
00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:55.820
<v Speaker 3>in your paper when you're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>the map.</v>

713
00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:04.910
<v Speaker 2>Hypothalamus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we haven't talked about that yet,</v>

714
00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:07.010
<v Speaker 2>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a perfectly reasonable question.</v>

715
00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:08.660
<v Speaker 2>That's actually why I'm.</v>

716
00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:13.310
<v Speaker 3>That was the most stable psychological </v>
<v Speaker 3>as well.</v>

717
00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:14.553
<v Speaker 3>What was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you mentioned that motivation is </v>

718
00:39:37.890 --> 00:39:42.190
<v Speaker 3>motivation provides most stable of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same logical strategy.</v>

719
00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:43.791
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

720
00:39:43.791 --> 00:39:46.230
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so far so good.</v>

721
00:39:46.231 --> 00:39:47.900
<v Speaker 2>Couldn't conceptualize the brain like </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

722
00:39:47.901 --> 00:39:48.734
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hear about emotions and motivations </v>

723
00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:50.773
<v Speaker 2>and I'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well those are low resolution boxes </v>

724
00:39:52.970 --> 00:39:53.803
<v Speaker 2>because it actually turns out that if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at each of the major </v>

725
00:39:55.791 --> 00:39:58.940
<v Speaker 2>motivational systems and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can argue about what they are,</v>

726
00:39:58.941 --> 00:40:02.060
<v Speaker 2>but we can kind of lay them out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pain is one that's for sure.</v>

727
00:40:02.061 --> 00:40:04.460
<v Speaker 2>That's an old one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thirst,</v>

728
00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:06.170
<v Speaker 2>hunger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexual drive,</v>

729
00:40:06.171 --> 00:40:10.250
<v Speaker 2>defensive aggression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a predatory aggression,</v>

730
00:40:10.450 --> 00:40:14.180
<v Speaker 2>a play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a love pair.</v>

731
00:40:14.181 --> 00:40:15.830
<v Speaker 2>Bonding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

732
00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:18.170
<v Speaker 2>what else?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's basic emotions,</v>

733
00:40:18.171 --> 00:40:19.004
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those there's like hope and surprise </v>

734
00:40:20.721 --> 00:40:23.120
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and joy and fear.</v>

735
00:40:23.121 --> 00:40:24.580
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

736
00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:27.980
<v Speaker 2>discussed and that's good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get the picture,</v>

737
00:40:27.981 --> 00:40:30.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you can expand that and contract it</v>

738
00:40:30.051 --> 00:40:32.900
<v Speaker 2>depending on how you conceptualize it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can say,</v>

739
00:40:32.901 --> 00:40:33.734
<v Speaker 2>well some of those are motivational </v>
<v Speaker 2>systems and some of them was her </v>

740
00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:36.410
<v Speaker 2>emotional systems.</v>

741
00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:40.550
<v Speaker 2>And the actual answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

742
00:40:40.551 --> 00:40:45.551
<v Speaker 2>not exactly because that's only a low </v>
<v Speaker 2>resolution categorization system.</v>

743
00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:49.370
<v Speaker 2>It might be useful to distinguish them </v>
<v Speaker 2>from cognitive systems,</v>

744
00:40:49.371 --> 00:40:50.204
<v Speaker 2>but the truth of the matter is that each</v>
<v Speaker 2>of those systems has its own </v>

745
00:40:54.771 --> 00:40:55.604
<v Speaker 2>neurological substrate and those </v>
<v Speaker 2>neurological substrates are not </v>

746
00:40:59.451 --> 00:41:00.284
<v Speaker 2>identical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's some similarities between </v>

747
00:41:02.391 --> 00:41:03.830
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's lots of differences.</v>

748
00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:04.873
<v Speaker 2>And so some things are more emotional </v>
<v Speaker 2>and some things are sort of half like </v>

749
00:41:07.341 --> 00:41:10.670
<v Speaker 2>emotions and motivations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anger is sort of like that.</v>

750
00:41:10.910 --> 00:41:11.743
<v Speaker 2>And then some things are more pure </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivations because hunger people don't </v>

751
00:41:14.211 --> 00:41:18.980
<v Speaker 2>generally think of that as an emotion </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think it has to do mostly with the</v>

752
00:41:18.981 --> 00:41:19.814
<v Speaker 2>propensity of the underlying system to </v>
<v Speaker 2>establish an entire framework of </v>

753
00:41:23.421 --> 00:41:25.640
<v Speaker 2>reference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So hunger will do that.</v>

754
00:41:26.290 --> 00:41:28.010
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anger will do that,</v>

755
00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:30.680
<v Speaker 2>thirst will do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexual drives will do that.</v>

756
00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:32.330
<v Speaker 2>They come up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

757
00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:35.960
<v Speaker 2>there's a associated with them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wants something,</v>

758
00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:38.180
<v Speaker 2>it sees the world in that manner.</v>

759
00:41:38.430 --> 00:41:39.263
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it primes a certain class of behaviors </v>

760
00:41:41.241 --> 00:41:44.840
<v Speaker 2>that are associated with that and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>runs like a partial personality,</v>

761
00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:46.033
<v Speaker 2>but then something like fear seems to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>more something that exists and operates </v>

762
00:41:49.851 --> 00:41:52.790
<v Speaker 2>within a framework rather than producing</v>
<v Speaker 2>its own framework.</v>

763
00:41:53.090 --> 00:41:53.923
<v Speaker 2>So it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The point is there's a lot of these </v>

764
00:41:55.581 --> 00:41:56.414
<v Speaker 2>underlying systems and they have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>capacity to set up these frameworks of </v>

765
00:42:01.461 --> 00:42:05.090
<v Speaker 2>reference that we're talking about and </v>
<v Speaker 2>to run the mass processes.</v>

766
00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:06.193
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the reason I said they're stable is </v>

767
00:42:07.641 --> 00:42:11.990
<v Speaker 2>because they'll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The deeper you'd go down into the brain,</v>

768
00:42:12.110 --> 00:42:15.380
<v Speaker 2>the older the brain part is and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hypothalamus,</v>

769
00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:16.483
<v Speaker 2>it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really old and it's so powerful that if </v>

770
00:42:19.371 --> 00:42:20.204
<v Speaker 2>you take your whole brain off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>except for the hypothalamus and the </v>

771
00:42:23.181 --> 00:42:25.820
<v Speaker 2>spinal cord,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which leaves you with no brain at all.</v>

772
00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:27.043
<v Speaker 2>If you're a cat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a pretty complicated thing and </v>

773
00:42:28.791 --> 00:42:31.900
<v Speaker 2>you're female,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can still pretty much exists.</v>

774
00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:36.710
<v Speaker 2>So if you put a female cat in a box and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you take its brain off,</v>

775
00:42:36.711 --> 00:42:40.760
<v Speaker 2>including even the emotional sectors and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just leave it with the hypothalamus,</v>

776
00:42:40.970 --> 00:42:41.803
<v Speaker 2>if you watch the cat can't handle novel </v>
<v Speaker 2>environments obviously because it can't </v>

777
00:42:46.791 --> 00:42:48.830
<v Speaker 2>really learn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it can do cat things.</v>

778
00:42:48.831 --> 00:42:50.390
<v Speaker 2>No problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can feed itself,</v>

779
00:42:50.391 --> 00:42:53.390
<v Speaker 2>it can engage in defensive aggression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can mate,</v>

780
00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:56.000
<v Speaker 2>it can generally interact with its </v>
<v Speaker 2>kittens.</v>

781
00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:58.910
<v Speaker 2>And one of the weird things is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is so funny,</v>

782
00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:02.720
<v Speaker 2>a cat with no brain is hyper </v>
<v Speaker 2>exploratory.</v>

783
00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:04.513
<v Speaker 2>It's like you think what the hell?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you'd think it'd be the brand </v>

784
00:43:07.491 --> 00:43:09.080
<v Speaker 2>that's doing the exploring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like no,</v>

785
00:43:09.081 --> 00:43:09.914
<v Speaker 2>it's the hypothalamus that's motivating </v>
<v Speaker 2>the exploring the brain stores the </v>

786
00:43:12.681 --> 00:43:16.280
<v Speaker 2>results of the exploring and shuts the </v>
<v Speaker 2>exploration off.</v>

787
00:43:16.610 --> 00:43:19.820
<v Speaker 2>So if you take the brain off then the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cat just runs around and trying to learn</v>

788
00:43:19.821 --> 00:43:21.830
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it can't because it doesn't remember</v>

789
00:43:21.831 --> 00:43:22.940
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

790
00:43:22.941 --> 00:43:23.774
<v Speaker 2>But it's quite fascinating because we </v>
<v Speaker 2>tend to think of the top part of the </v>

791
00:43:25.971 --> 00:43:29.990
<v Speaker 2>brain is so bloody important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a no</v>

792
00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:35.713
<v Speaker 3>is what</v>

793
00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:39.980
<v Speaker 2>take the whole critical cap off and </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost all the emotional systems,</v>

794
00:43:39.981 --> 00:43:41.570
<v Speaker 2>like 85 percent of the braid.</v>

795
00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:45.073
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>

796
00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:52.400
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no motor cortex.</v>

797
00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:56.150
<v Speaker 2>It's running on reflex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're interested,</v>

798
00:43:56.151 --> 00:43:59.540
<v Speaker 2>I actually have some diagrams of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but look up decorticate cat,</v>

799
00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:00.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can.</v>

800
00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:04.490
<v Speaker 2>There's lots of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

801
00:44:04.491 --> 00:44:05.061
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

802
00:44:05.061 --> 00:44:06.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other people did,</v>

803
00:44:06.081 --> 00:44:06.914
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people have done a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiments on animals and their </v>

804
00:44:10.821 --> 00:44:14.660
<v Speaker 2>neurological function and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>things they were interested in as well,</v>

805
00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:19.580
<v Speaker 2>how much brain can you remove and still </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a functioning animal?</v>

806
00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:23.270
<v Speaker 2>And the answer is pretty much all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's like,</v>

807
00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:25.100
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who the hell would possible?</v>

808
00:44:25.110 --> 00:44:27.500
<v Speaker 2>And if you're interested in that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would read Swanson again.</v>

809
00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:30.040
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm sure that papers on the websites</v>

810
00:44:30.050 --> 00:44:32.420
<v Speaker 2>that sorenson paper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now that's a work of genius,</v>

811
00:44:32.421 --> 00:44:33.254
<v Speaker 2>that thing.</v>

812
00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:36.373
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're male sexual behavior is </v>

813
00:44:38.761 --> 00:44:43.290
<v Speaker 2>harder to organize.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so decorticate males can mate.</v>

814
00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:45.780
<v Speaker 2>So if you ever meet a male who can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>mate,</v>

815
00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:49.380
<v Speaker 2>then anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>

816
00:44:49.470 --> 00:44:50.700
<v Speaker 2>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

817
00:44:50.730 --> 00:44:52.920
<v Speaker 2>that's the reason is that there are </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain elements of,</v>

818
00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.520
<v Speaker 2>of male sexual behavior that required </v>
<v Speaker 2>more complex organization.</v>

819
00:44:56.930 --> 00:44:57.763
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's one thing a decorticate male </v>

820
00:44:59.731 --> 00:45:00.564
<v Speaker 2>can't do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's easier to distinguish them from </v>

821
00:45:02.311 --> 00:45:03.870
<v Speaker 2>females,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the female cats.</v>

822
00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:05.250
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the only reason.</v>

823
00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:06.181
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

824
00:45:06.181 --> 00:45:08.880
<v Speaker 2>so you get the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like at the bottom of the brain,</v>

825
00:45:08.881 --> 00:45:09.714
<v Speaker 2>there's all these systems that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>really alive and sort of on fire and </v>

826
00:45:12.961 --> 00:45:16.550
<v Speaker 2>they're all generating up these </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivational frames of reference and,</v>

827
00:45:16.570 --> 00:45:17.820
<v Speaker 2>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do that,</v>

828
00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:20.010
<v Speaker 2>that's instinct,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>

829
00:45:20.011 --> 00:45:20.844
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then all of that's elaborate it up </v>

830
00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:24.210
<v Speaker 2>by the cortex and the Cortex is saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

831
00:45:24.211 --> 00:45:29.070
<v Speaker 2>well these things are like a pack of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting two year olds.</v>

832
00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:29.933
<v Speaker 2>So by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I mean that because if you take </v>

833
00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:36.290
<v Speaker 2>children and you put them in age matched</v>
<v Speaker 2>groups and you.</v>

834
00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:37.153
<v Speaker 2>So you have a group of 18 months olds </v>
<v Speaker 2>and two year olds and three year olds </v>

835
00:45:39.391 --> 00:45:40.224
<v Speaker 2>and four year olds and so all the way up</v>
<v Speaker 2>to 16 year olds say and then you count </v>

836
00:45:43.651 --> 00:45:45.780
<v Speaker 2>violent interactions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kicking,</v>

837
00:45:45.781 --> 00:45:46.501
<v Speaker 2>hitting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>biting,</v>

838
00:45:46.501 --> 00:45:48.690
<v Speaker 2>stealing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The two year olds are like,</v>

839
00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:49.913
<v Speaker 2>they're just all over that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not actually quite right </v>

840
00:45:53.131 --> 00:45:55.320
<v Speaker 2>because some of the two year olds are </v>
<v Speaker 2>peaceful and passive,</v>

841
00:45:55.321 --> 00:45:56.154
<v Speaker 2>but there's a subset of the two year </v>
<v Speaker 2>olds that are like chaotic motivational </v>

842
00:46:00.061 --> 00:46:00.960
<v Speaker 2>machines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

843
00:46:00.961 --> 00:46:04.170
<v Speaker 2>They're just running around being as </v>
<v Speaker 2>impulsive as can possibly be,</v>

844
00:46:04.171 --> 00:46:05.004
<v Speaker 2>and you can think about them as under </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost under complete hypothalamus </v>

845
00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:07.853
<v Speaker 2>control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're just cycling from one intense </v>

846
00:46:09.931 --> 00:46:13.530
<v Speaker 2>motivational state to another that makes</v>
<v Speaker 2>two year olds a blast.</v>

847
00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:14.393
<v Speaker 2>Like they're really fun to be around </v>
<v Speaker 2>except they're kind of a pain in the </v>

848
00:46:15.961 --> 00:46:16.794
<v Speaker 2>neck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're really fun because they're </v>

849
00:46:17.791 --> 00:46:19.800
<v Speaker 2>really on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're into this and into that,</v>

850
00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:20.693
<v Speaker 2>into this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they fall down because they're </v>

851
00:46:21.511 --> 00:46:22.344
<v Speaker 2>too tired and then they wake up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're starving to death and you know </v>

852
00:46:24.691 --> 00:46:25.524
<v Speaker 2>they're really alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then what has to happen is that </v>

853
00:46:29.370 --> 00:46:32.010
<v Speaker 2>those behaviors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those motivational states,</v>

854
00:46:32.011 --> 00:46:36.090
<v Speaker 2>which are sort of working in isolation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they start to conflict with one another.</v>

855
00:46:36.210 --> 00:46:37.043
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that the child can't really organize </v>

856
00:46:39.031 --> 00:46:42.840
<v Speaker 2>any medium to longterm behavioral </v>
<v Speaker 2>strategies being that impulsive.</v>

857
00:46:43.170 --> 00:46:48.170
<v Speaker 2>So what the CORTEX is there is to start </v>
<v Speaker 2>sequencing those motivational systems in</v>

858
00:46:48.841 --> 00:46:49.674
<v Speaker 2>higher order structures that allow each </v>
<v Speaker 2>of them to get what they need in order </v>

859
00:46:53.221 --> 00:46:54.054
<v Speaker 2>to function across long periods of time </v>
<v Speaker 2>in increasingly complex social </v>

860
00:46:57.841 --> 00:47:00.360
<v Speaker 2>environments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what the CORTEX is for.</v>

861
00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:05.280
<v Speaker 2>So it's a complex regulatory mechanism </v>
<v Speaker 2>and what it's doing is keeping.</v>

862
00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:10.360
<v Speaker 2>It's like a nuclear reactor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The core is really hot and fiery and you</v>

863
00:47:10.801 --> 00:47:13.380
<v Speaker 2>need to sync rods into it to keep it </v>
<v Speaker 2>under control,</v>

864
00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:15.030
<v Speaker 2>to dampen it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's really,</v>

865
00:47:15.150 --> 00:47:15.983
<v Speaker 2>it's a good analogy for how your brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>works because the underlying systems </v>

866
00:47:18.271 --> 00:47:19.680
<v Speaker 2>they're on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're on fire,</v>

867
00:47:19.681 --> 00:47:22.830
<v Speaker 2>they're alive and the cortex is saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

868
00:47:23.250 --> 00:47:24.083
<v Speaker 2>a little bit of you now and a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 2>of you and then some of you and wait </v>

869
00:47:26.341 --> 00:47:27.174
<v Speaker 2>your turn and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it sequences out over stretches of </v>

870
00:47:29.951 --> 00:47:30.784
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's really socialization and that's </v>

871
00:47:32.471 --> 00:47:35.050
<v Speaker 2>quite a different view than the Freudian</v>
<v Speaker 2>view of repression,</v>

872
00:47:35.810 --> 00:47:36.643
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I would say you only have to </v>

873
00:47:37.301 --> 00:47:40.600
<v Speaker 2>repress a motivational system if you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>not very successful.</v>

874
00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:44.020
<v Speaker 2>Because if you're a successful and well </v>
<v Speaker 2>socialized person,</v>

875
00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:47.320
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to suppress them or </v>
<v Speaker 2>repress them,</v>

876
00:47:47.321 --> 00:47:48.154
<v Speaker 2>you just have to sequence them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all because they're all going to </v>

877
00:47:50.141 --> 00:47:52.270
<v Speaker 2>get what they want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

878
00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:53.313
<v Speaker 2>And that means that you're a good player</v>
<v Speaker 2>of complex social games and that has </v>

879
00:47:56.531 --> 00:47:58.780
<v Speaker 2>very little to do with repression or </v>
<v Speaker 2>inhibition.</v>

880
00:47:59.260 --> 00:48:02.320
<v Speaker 2>It's just sequencing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's important.</v>

881
00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:04.120
<v Speaker 2>It's important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What time do we have?</v>

882
00:48:05.860 --> 00:48:06.491
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

883
00:48:06.491 --> 00:48:07.001
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good,</v>

884
00:48:07.001 --> 00:48:07.834
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

885
00:48:10.570 --> 00:48:11.403
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so here's kind of an interesting way of </v>

886
00:48:12.281 --> 00:48:13.114
<v Speaker 2>looking at the Amygdala.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is from a Joseph Ledoux wrote a </v>

887
00:48:16.871 --> 00:48:17.704
<v Speaker 2>lovely book on the Amygdala and it also </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of shows you how your body is </v>

888
00:48:21.490 --> 00:48:23.140
<v Speaker 2>structured.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

889
00:48:23.141 --> 00:48:25.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you've ever heard of the</v>

890
00:48:25.361 --> 00:48:28.120
<v Speaker 2>phenomena of blind sight and do you know</v>
<v Speaker 2>what blind sight is?</v>

891
00:48:28.450 --> 00:48:31.390
<v Speaker 2>Did I tell you about blind sight or did </v>
<v Speaker 2>you learn that somewhere else?</v>

892
00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:32.411
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

893
00:48:32.411 --> 00:48:33.244
<v Speaker 2>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one way of being blind is to go like </v>

894
00:48:36.131 --> 00:48:36.964
<v Speaker 2>this and then you can't see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And another way is to have your retina </v>

895
00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:43.680
<v Speaker 2>destroyed and maybe the optic nerve </v>
<v Speaker 2>could go another way of being blind.</v>

896
00:48:43.681 --> 00:48:44.514
<v Speaker 2>Just have your visual cortex destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing about that's weird about </v>

897
00:48:48.251 --> 00:48:49.084
<v Speaker 2>having your visual cortex destroyed is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you think you can't see but you </v>

898
00:48:52.660 --> 00:48:53.493
<v Speaker 2>still can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just can't see the same way you saw </v>

899
00:48:56.501 --> 00:49:00.190
<v Speaker 2>before and you can't see objects </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciously.</v>

900
00:49:00.850 --> 00:49:05.200
<v Speaker 2>But if someone says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got one hand up,</v>

901
00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:07.540
<v Speaker 2>which one is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they say,</v>

902
00:49:07.541 --> 00:49:08.410
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't see it,</v>

903
00:49:08.411 --> 00:49:09.580
<v Speaker 2>and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guess.</v>

904
00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:12.880
<v Speaker 2>Then they can guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so you might say,</v>

905
00:49:12.881 --> 00:49:15.250
<v Speaker 2>well how can that be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the answer to that is,</v>

906
00:49:15.251 --> 00:49:16.084
<v Speaker 2>is that okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine for a minute that the world </v>

907
00:49:19.331 --> 00:49:20.164
<v Speaker 2>isn't made out of objects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine that it's made out of patterns </v>

908
00:49:24.670 --> 00:49:27.760
<v Speaker 2>because it is made out of patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Music is.</v>

909
00:49:27.810 --> 00:49:28.643
<v Speaker 2>That's why music is so intensely </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting because it's a </v>

910
00:49:30.431 --> 00:49:31.264
<v Speaker 2>representation of the world as a place </v>
<v Speaker 2>of patterns and a pattern is something </v>

911
00:49:35.621 --> 00:49:38.680
<v Speaker 2>that repeats because otherwise it </v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't be a pattern and the only thing</v>

912
00:49:38.681 --> 00:49:41.950
<v Speaker 2>you really need to keep track of things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that repeat because there is no such.</v>

913
00:49:42.490 --> 00:49:43.323
<v Speaker 2>There's no point knowing anything about </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that don't repeat because what </v>

914
00:49:46.031 --> 00:49:49.030
<v Speaker 2>the hell good is your knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the world is full of patterns.</v>

915
00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:50.253
<v Speaker 2>What happens is that that pattern is </v>
<v Speaker 2>transformed into a pattern on your </v>

916
00:49:53.471 --> 00:49:56.050
<v Speaker 2>retina.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a pattern of neuroactivation,</v>

917
00:49:56.260 --> 00:49:58.690
<v Speaker 2>and then there's multiple branches from </v>
<v Speaker 2>your retina,</v>

918
00:49:59.180 --> 00:50:02.800
<v Speaker 2>doesn't just go one place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it goes lots of places and each of those</v>

919
00:50:02.801 --> 00:50:03.634
<v Speaker 2>places it goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>produces its own implementation of that </v>

920
00:50:07.091 --> 00:50:07.924
<v Speaker 2>pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and one of those implementations allows </v>

921
00:50:10.301 --> 00:50:11.134
<v Speaker 2>you to see the world consciously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but other implementations have other </v>

922
00:50:14.201 --> 00:50:15.430
<v Speaker 2>functions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

923
00:50:15.431 --> 00:50:16.264
<v Speaker 2>if you show someone with flying site and</v>
<v Speaker 2>angry face and you record their </v>

924
00:50:20.321 --> 00:50:24.610
<v Speaker 2>psychophysiological responses and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>show them a neutral or a smiling face,</v>

925
00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:25.833
<v Speaker 2>you can distinguish their physiological </v>
<v Speaker 2>responses to the angry or fearful face </v>

926
00:50:29.481 --> 00:50:30.314
<v Speaker 2>from the happy or neutral face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the reason for that is that one of </v>

927
00:50:33.951 --> 00:50:34.784
<v Speaker 2>the patterns that your retina is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is picking up is the facial </v>

928
00:50:38.541 --> 00:50:39.374
<v Speaker 2>configurations of human being </v>
<v Speaker 2>specifically because that's really </v>

929
00:50:42.081 --> 00:50:45.590
<v Speaker 2>important to us and that's delivered to </v>
<v Speaker 2>a specific part of your brain.</v>

930
00:50:45.590 --> 00:50:46.970
<v Speaker 2>It seems to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least in part,</v>

931
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:52.000
<v Speaker 2>the Amygdala and what the Amygdala does </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically is says this.</v>

932
00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:53.570
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not very good.</v>

933
00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:54.583
<v Speaker 2>This means this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it maps that pattern onto this </v>

934
00:50:59.001 --> 00:50:59.834
<v Speaker 2>pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't need to see anything for that </v>

935
00:51:00.981 --> 00:51:01.970
<v Speaker 2>to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

936
00:51:01.971 --> 00:51:04.850
<v Speaker 2>You just have to translate the pattern </v>
<v Speaker 2>into motor action.</v>

937
00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:09.860
<v Speaker 2>Lots of animals see that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like when when a fly flies by a frog,</v>

938
00:51:10.070 --> 00:51:10.903
<v Speaker 2>the frog doesn't see the fly and think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well there's a fly and then like nails </v>

939
00:51:12.981 --> 00:51:13.814
<v Speaker 2>it with its tongue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the fly flying by pattern </v>

940
00:51:17.001 --> 00:51:17.834
<v Speaker 2>activates the tongue sticking out </v>
<v Speaker 2>pattern and it does it in like 100th of </v>

941
00:51:21.711 --> 00:51:22.544
<v Speaker 2>a second as as a obviously because like </v>
<v Speaker 2>have you ever tried to catch a fly with </v>

942
00:51:26.181 --> 00:51:27.014
<v Speaker 2>your tongue?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's not easy but a frog can </v>

943
00:51:28.791 --> 00:51:29.624
<v Speaker 2>really do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the fact that the frogs visual </v>

944
00:51:31.671 --> 00:51:32.504
<v Speaker 2>system is so simple and specialized </v>
<v Speaker 2>means that there's hardly any neural </v>

945
00:51:36.161 --> 00:51:36.994
<v Speaker 2>connections between the perception of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the pattern of the fly and the motor </v>

946
00:51:40.521 --> 00:51:41.150
<v Speaker 2>response.</v>

947
00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:41.983
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe there's two neurons </v>
<v Speaker 2>intermediate thing and so that frog and </v>

948
00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:46.880
<v Speaker 2>nail that fly right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas you,</v>

949
00:51:47.210 --> 00:51:48.043
<v Speaker 2>you're going to wait around until you </v>
<v Speaker 2>see the fly and then you know you're </v>

950
00:51:49.911 --> 00:51:54.770
<v Speaker 2>going to swat it and a fly sees this </v>
<v Speaker 2>loophole and it's like it's gone for.</v>

951
00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:57.710
<v Speaker 2>It's gone in a week of flight time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the time you hit the,</v>

952
00:51:57.980 --> 00:52:01.100
<v Speaker 2>by the time you hit the you know the </v>
<v Speaker 2>table with your flyswatter.</v>

953
00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:06.350
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to rely on your conscious</v>
<v Speaker 2>vision to do extraordinarily fast things</v>

954
00:52:06.351 --> 00:52:08.600
<v Speaker 2>because it takes under normal </v>
<v Speaker 2>conditions.</v>

955
00:52:08.601 --> 00:52:09.434
<v Speaker 2>It takes maybe a quarter to half a </v>
<v Speaker 2>second to become consciously aware of a </v>

956
00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:14.823
<v Speaker 2>phenomenal logical entity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like for snakes or things like </v>

957
00:52:17.811 --> 00:52:18.231
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

958
00:52:18.231 --> 00:52:19.790
<v Speaker 2>they've bitten you by the time you see </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

959
00:52:20.150 --> 00:52:25.150
<v Speaker 2>So what Luddu pointed out is that to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>underlying motivational areas,</v>

960
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:26.833
<v Speaker 2>there's lots of sensory inputs that </v>
<v Speaker 2>bypass the representational processing </v>

961
00:52:31.521 --> 00:52:33.860
<v Speaker 2>that's characteristic of the cortex.</v>

962
00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:38.840
<v Speaker 2>And so if you're walking down a path and</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a little snake like movement occurs</v>

963
00:52:38.841 --> 00:52:39.674
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to catch that with the </v>

964
00:52:40.821 --> 00:52:44.540
<v Speaker 2>periphery of your vision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now try this.</v>

965
00:52:44.541 --> 00:52:46.820
<v Speaker 2>So look at this finger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay?</v>

966
00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:50.930
<v Speaker 2>Now look at the finger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but concentrate on my face.</v>

967
00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:53.090
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't look at my face.</v>

968
00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:54.980
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ready for that?</v>

969
00:52:56.530 --> 00:52:57.980
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

970
00:52:57.981 --> 00:52:59.840
<v Speaker 2>so what do you see?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you see?</v>

971
00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:01.873
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see the teeth and eyes and if like </v>

972
00:53:02.990 --> 00:53:04.460
<v Speaker 2>look again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

973
00:53:04.461 --> 00:53:05.294
<v Speaker 2>if you pay careful attention,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll be able to see that you cannot </v>

974
00:53:07.941 --> 00:53:11.990
<v Speaker 2>see my nose because who cares what my </v>
<v Speaker 2>nose is doing.</v>

975
00:53:11.991 --> 00:53:14.120
<v Speaker 2>You don't care,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're Mengele certainly doesn't care.</v>

976
00:53:14.121 --> 00:53:17.210
<v Speaker 2>So why bother seeing it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a make dilla cares about what the</v>

977
00:53:17.211 --> 00:53:18.044
<v Speaker 2>hell you're eyes are pointing out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether or not your teeth are there and </v>

978
00:53:20.451 --> 00:53:23.060
<v Speaker 2>it cares about that with other creatures</v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

979
00:53:23.450 --> 00:53:24.283
<v Speaker 2>And so your peripheral vision is low </v>
<v Speaker 2>resolution is wired up to detect </v>

980
00:53:27.811 --> 00:53:28.644
<v Speaker 2>movement and threat and what does the </v>
<v Speaker 2>detection is super fast because well it </v>

981
00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:35.400
<v Speaker 2>better be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you going to get bit?</v>

982
00:53:35.401 --> 00:53:38.520
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one day I was in California and I was</v>

983
00:53:38.521 --> 00:53:43.521
<v Speaker 2>walking down this pathway on a cliff or </v>
<v Speaker 2>facing the ocean in La and it was,</v>

984
00:53:43.591 --> 00:53:47.460
<v Speaker 2>I think it was march or something and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there was this guy in front of me,</v>

985
00:53:47.461 --> 00:53:48.294
<v Speaker 2>this is like six foot seven and right in</v>
<v Speaker 2>front of him was his four year old </v>

986
00:53:50.581 --> 00:53:51.414
<v Speaker 2>daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're walking along and all of a </v>

987
00:53:52.531 --> 00:53:57.000
<v Speaker 2>sudden she goes and jumps right onto his</v>
<v Speaker 2>shoulders.</v>

988
00:53:57.001 --> 00:53:58.190
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what cats,</v>

989
00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:01.590
<v Speaker 2>like when you started just poof and runs</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

990
00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:03.580
<v Speaker 2>a very funny thing to do to cats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

991
00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:06.660
<v Speaker 2>there was a rattlesnake right beside the</v>
<v Speaker 2>path.</v>

992
00:54:07.140 --> 00:54:08.970
<v Speaker 2>Now it was kind of slow because it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>cold,</v>

993
00:54:09.210 --> 00:54:10.043
<v Speaker 2>but obviously what had happened to her </v>
<v Speaker 2>is her periphery caught the rattlesnake </v>

994
00:54:12.450 --> 00:54:14.520
<v Speaker 2>and she was up in her father's shoulders</v>
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>

995
00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:16.620
<v Speaker 2>before she saw the snake.</v>

996
00:54:16.950 --> 00:54:19.440
<v Speaker 2>And it's a good thing because if it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>a stick,</v>

997
00:54:19.441 --> 00:54:21.600
<v Speaker 2>well who cares?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's expanded a little energy,</v>

998
00:54:21.870 --> 00:54:22.703
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the Amygdala can be kind of low </v>

999
00:54:23.851 --> 00:54:25.950
<v Speaker 2>resolution and it's still useful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if it,</v>

1000
00:54:26.250 --> 00:54:30.180
<v Speaker 2>if it was a snake and it was going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>strike the fact that she had jumped onto</v>

1001
00:54:30.181 --> 00:54:33.990
<v Speaker 2>his shoulders before she even saw it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to save her.</v>

1002
00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:37.380
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the things that in </v>
<v Speaker 2>principle,</v>

1003
00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:38.693
<v Speaker 2>the underlying motivational systems are </v>
<v Speaker 2>wired up to detect our primary fear </v>

1004
00:54:44.181 --> 00:54:46.020
<v Speaker 2>stimuli.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so those would be.</v>

1005
00:54:46.021 --> 00:54:48.060
<v Speaker 2>You can kind of list them off now for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>long time.</v>

1006
00:54:48.061 --> 00:54:49.950
<v Speaker 2>People thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you learn to be afraid,</v>

1007
00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:52.440
<v Speaker 2>which I told you is a rubbish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She learned not to be afraid.</v>

1008
00:54:52.890 --> 00:54:53.723
<v Speaker 2>Then they thought that you could learn </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be afraid to some things more easily </v>

1009
00:54:58.111 --> 00:55:01.110
<v Speaker 2>than others,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you still had to be exposed to those</v>

1010
00:55:01.111 --> 00:55:03.260
<v Speaker 2>things and then they figured out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1011
00:55:03.261 --> 00:55:04.890
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's just things you're afraid of.</v>

1012
00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:08.970
<v Speaker 2>And one of those things is snakes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>chimpanzees for example,</v>

1013
00:55:08.971 --> 00:55:12.240
<v Speaker 2>they don't like snakes and even if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>raise chimps and monkeys,</v>

1014
00:55:12.510 --> 00:55:14.640
<v Speaker 2>so they never see a snake and you show </v>
<v Speaker 2>them a snake,</v>

1015
00:55:14.641 --> 00:55:18.810
<v Speaker 2>they are not happy about the snake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the snakes like Uber Predator,</v>

1016
00:55:19.140 --> 00:55:20.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found now that mammals,</v>

1017
00:55:20.851 --> 00:55:23.640
<v Speaker 2>I should have known this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>been around for about 220 million years.</v>

1018
00:55:23.641 --> 00:55:24.474
<v Speaker 2>So we've been battling with reptiles for</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very long period of time right back </v>

1019
00:55:27.721 --> 00:55:32.721
<v Speaker 2>when there were dinosaurs anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the idea that like predatory reptiles</v>

1020
00:55:32.941 --> 00:55:35.850
<v Speaker 2>are a bad thing that's way deep down </v>
<v Speaker 2>inside of us.</v>

1021
00:55:35.851 --> 00:55:40.320
<v Speaker 2>And so we have systems that we've </v>
<v Speaker 2>conserved as we've evolved,</v>

1022
00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:44.610
<v Speaker 2>not because they're accurate but because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're really damn fast.</v>

1023
00:55:44.611 --> 00:55:48.420
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the things your retinal </v>
<v Speaker 2>patterns do is map themselves right onto</v>

1024
00:55:48.421 --> 00:55:50.970
<v Speaker 2>your spinal cord.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's super fast,</v>

1025
00:55:50.971 --> 00:55:53.970
<v Speaker 2>super low resolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it means your eyes can make your body</v>

1026
00:55:53.971 --> 00:55:54.804
<v Speaker 2>move.</v>

1027
00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:57.360
<v Speaker 2>There's almost no intermediation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking.</v>

1028
00:55:57.600 --> 00:56:01.470
<v Speaker 2>And so the old behavioral ideas that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>were a stimulus response machine,</v>

1029
00:56:02.070 --> 00:56:02.903
<v Speaker 2>we're right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>except that you're a stimulus response </v>

1030
00:56:04.711 --> 00:56:08.280
<v Speaker 2>machine with a bunch of more complex </v>
<v Speaker 2>processes built on top of that.</v>

1031
00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:12.210
<v Speaker 2>But the stimulus response machine is </v>
<v Speaker 2>still there and the reason it's there is</v>

1032
00:56:12.211 --> 00:56:13.044
<v Speaker 2>because it's super fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there are these multiple levels </v>

1033
00:56:17.071 --> 00:56:22.071
<v Speaker 2>of the nervous system and as you go down</v>
<v Speaker 2>into more and more fundamental systems,</v>

1034
00:56:22.890 --> 00:56:23.723
<v Speaker 2>they're faster and more stereotyped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as you move up there are more </v>

1035
00:56:27.281 --> 00:56:28.114
<v Speaker 2>complex and slower and the sensory </v>
<v Speaker 2>systems have input more or less at each </v>

1036
00:56:31.991 --> 00:56:32.824
<v Speaker 2>level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so partly what your brain is trying </v>

1037
00:56:34.781 --> 00:56:35.614
<v Speaker 2>to figure out is when should you use the</v>
<v Speaker 2>quick and dirty systems and wind should </v>

1038
00:56:37.841 --> 00:56:40.930
<v Speaker 2>use the Slo and contemplate of systems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the answer is,</v>

1039
00:56:41.170 --> 00:56:45.910
<v Speaker 2>if it's a primary fear stimuli,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which would be fire teeth,</v>

1040
00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:50.740
<v Speaker 2>skeletons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blood Genetalia,</v>

1041
00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:54.430
<v Speaker 2>generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm Saudi it.</v>

1042
00:56:55.820 --> 00:56:56.653
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1043
00:56:56.710 --> 00:56:58.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>immobile bodies.</v>

1044
00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:02.820
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then there's all sorts of noises.</v>

1045
00:57:02.850 --> 00:57:04.650
<v Speaker 2>Baby cries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

1046
00:57:04.651 --> 00:57:07.800
<v Speaker 2>we just did an experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told you guys about latent inhibition.</v>

1047
00:57:08.130 --> 00:57:09.660
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe not.</v>

1048
00:57:10.140 --> 00:57:10.973
<v Speaker 2>If I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1049
00:57:11.660 --> 00:57:16.660
<v Speaker 2>if you listen to a bunch of numbers and </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the background you hear a white noise</v>

1050
00:57:16.820 --> 00:57:17.653
<v Speaker 2>burst,</v>

1051
00:57:18.260 --> 00:57:19.093
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

1052
00:57:19.430 --> 00:57:20.263
<v Speaker 2>So maybe I get you to listen to that for</v>
<v Speaker 2>three minutes and I tell you to count </v>

1053
00:57:22.641 --> 00:57:24.140
<v Speaker 2>your number.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

1054
00:57:24.710 --> 00:57:25.543
<v Speaker 2>Then I play the same soundtrack and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>show you a bunch of lights and the </v>

1055
00:57:27.561 --> 00:57:32.150
<v Speaker 2>lights go on one by one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I tried to get you to predict what's</v>

1056
00:57:32.420 --> 00:57:36.140
<v Speaker 2>turning those lights on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I may get the white noise burst,</v>

1057
00:57:36.830 --> 00:57:40.040
<v Speaker 2>and you've already heard that for three </v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes when it didn't signify anything,</v>

1058
00:57:40.130 --> 00:57:43.430
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be very difficult for you </v>
<v Speaker 2>to learn that the white noise bursts are</v>

1059
00:57:43.431 --> 00:57:44.264
<v Speaker 2>now what turns on the lights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the way you determine that as you </v>

1060
00:57:46.670 --> 00:57:49.340
<v Speaker 2>play people before exposing them to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>lights,</v>

1061
00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:53.840
<v Speaker 2>one tape that has the white noise bursts</v>
<v Speaker 2>and another tape that doesn't.</v>

1062
00:57:54.530 --> 00:57:57.710
<v Speaker 2>And then you play both of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both groups,</v>

1063
00:57:57.711 --> 00:58:00.680
<v Speaker 2>the white noise burst and the numbers </v>
<v Speaker 2>and turn on the lights,</v>

1064
00:58:00.681 --> 00:58:01.514
<v Speaker 2>and the people who weren't pre-exposure </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the white noise learn it faster by a </v>

1065
00:58:05.841 --> 00:58:07.820
<v Speaker 2>substantial amount that's called latent </v>
<v Speaker 2>inhibition.</v>

1066
00:58:07.820 --> 00:58:10.070
<v Speaker 2>And that's what makes things invisible </v>
<v Speaker 2>for you.</v>

1067
00:58:10.430 --> 00:58:12.020
<v Speaker 2>You see things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing happens.</v>

1068
00:58:12.030 --> 00:58:13.820
<v Speaker 2>You learned to ignore them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're irrelevant.</v>

1069
00:58:14.150 --> 00:58:18.800
<v Speaker 2>So you're using latent inhibition to </v>
<v Speaker 2>eradicate their relevance.</v>

1070
00:58:19.250 --> 00:58:20.083
<v Speaker 2>We did it with baby cries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People don't develop latent inhibition </v>

1071
00:58:22.491 --> 00:58:23.324
<v Speaker 2>to baby cry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you put a little baby crying in </v>

1072
00:58:24.561 --> 00:58:25.394
<v Speaker 2>the back instead of white noise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter how many times do you </v>

1073
00:58:27.591 --> 00:58:29.170
<v Speaker 2>expose the person to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1074
00:58:29.330 --> 00:58:31.700
<v Speaker 2>they learned that the baby cried turns </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the lights right away.</v>

1075
00:58:31.940 --> 00:58:36.620
<v Speaker 2>And so what I'm thinking is that the way</v>
<v Speaker 2>that your brain makes things relevant is</v>

1076
00:58:36.621 --> 00:58:37.454
<v Speaker 2>it makes everything irrelevant except </v>
<v Speaker 2>for certain categories of things that </v>

1077
00:58:40.881 --> 00:58:43.520
<v Speaker 2>you can't learn to habituate to no </v>
<v Speaker 2>matter what you do.</v>

1078
00:58:43.970 --> 00:58:45.890
<v Speaker 2>And those would be the categories I just</v>
<v Speaker 2>described.</v>

1079
00:58:46.310 --> 00:58:47.143
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the fact that Janet Halley are part </v>

1080
00:58:48.441 --> 00:58:49.520
<v Speaker 2>of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially for men,</v>

1081
00:58:49.521 --> 00:58:50.354
<v Speaker 2>if it's pictorial representations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>accounts for the absolutely addictive </v>

1082
00:58:52.941 --> 00:58:54.530
<v Speaker 2>nature of pornography,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you can't,</v>

1083
00:58:54.770 --> 00:58:58.220
<v Speaker 2>you cannot habituate to the images,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although men do to some degree,</v>

1084
00:58:58.550 --> 00:59:01.250
<v Speaker 2>but it's very difficult habituate to </v>
<v Speaker 2>those images.</v>

1085
00:59:01.700 --> 00:59:05.760
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1086
00:59:05.761 --> 00:59:06.594
<v Speaker 2>so your brain assumes that everything is</v>
<v Speaker 2>relevant and important until you learn </v>

1087
00:59:08.851 --> 00:59:10.200
<v Speaker 2>that it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And once you learn it,</v>

1088
00:59:10.201 --> 00:59:11.940
<v Speaker 2>it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't even pay any attention to it.</v>

1089
00:59:12.150 --> 00:59:16.710
<v Speaker 2>And then your brain basically removes </v>
<v Speaker 2>the blocking from things</v>

1090
00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:22.400
<v Speaker 2>dependent on your state of motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what makes it relevant.</v>

1091
00:59:22.401 --> 00:59:24.080
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you get hungry,</v>

1092
00:59:24.110 --> 00:59:24.943
<v Speaker 2>if you're not hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>foods irrelevant if you are hungry than </v>

1093
00:59:27.231 --> 00:59:29.180
<v Speaker 2>the latent inhibition gets stripped off </v>
<v Speaker 2>the food.</v>

1094
00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:31.640
<v Speaker 2>And so all of a sudden it's all </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaningful and interesting.</v>

1095
00:59:31.820 --> 00:59:34.760
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like it was before you're,</v>

1096
00:59:35.870 --> 00:59:37.250
<v Speaker 2>before you learned that it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>irrelevant.</v>

1097
00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:43.200
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the list of Amygdala output.</v>

1098
00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:44.153
<v Speaker 2>Same idea basically apply.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the sensory systems put input into </v>

1099
00:59:49.311 --> 00:59:50.144
<v Speaker 2>multiple levels of the nervous system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the emotional systems and the </v>

1100
00:59:52.551 --> 00:59:57.020
<v Speaker 2>motivational systems also have multiple </v>
<v Speaker 2>levels of output to the brain hierarchy.</v>

1101
00:59:57.021 --> 01:00:02.021
<v Speaker 2>So I'm Ledoux is identified,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is partly associated with anxiety,</v>

1102
01:00:03.290 --> 01:00:05.030
<v Speaker 2>Tachycardia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>increased heart rate,</v>

1103
01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:06.830
<v Speaker 2>galvanic skin response,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paleness,</v>

1104
01:00:06.831 --> 01:00:08.210
<v Speaker 2>pupil dilation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blood pressure,</v>

1105
01:00:08.211 --> 01:00:11.960
<v Speaker 2>elevation ulcers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is more chronic urination,</v>

1106
01:00:11.961 --> 01:00:13.850
<v Speaker 2>defecation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1107
01:00:13.851 --> 01:00:15.290
<v Speaker 2>Bradycardia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>panting,</v>

1108
01:00:15.291 --> 01:00:18.650
<v Speaker 2>respiratory distress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>behavioral and Eeg arousal,</v>

1109
01:00:18.651 --> 01:00:20.660
<v Speaker 2>increased vigilance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>increased attention,</v>

1110
01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:25.550
<v Speaker 2>heightened startle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>freezing hyperalgesia,</v>

1111
01:00:25.950 --> 01:00:26.783
<v Speaker 2>so you can't feel pain as much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Facial expressions of fear and </v>

1112
01:00:29.610 --> 01:00:32.000
<v Speaker 2>corticosteroid release.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you see that when you say,</v>

1113
01:00:32.001 --> 01:00:32.990
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's fear?</v>

1114
01:00:32.991 --> 01:00:34.100
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1115
01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:35.353
<v Speaker 2>it's a multilevel phenomena and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>manifests itself across different </v>

1116
01:00:37.911 --> 01:00:40.300
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies of the nervous system and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1117
01:00:40.550 --> 01:00:45.350
<v Speaker 2>and those systems different complexity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they did and they differ in speed,</v>

1118
01:00:45.410 --> 01:00:47.150
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the other thing for humans,</v>

1119
01:00:47.151 --> 01:00:47.984
<v Speaker 2>what's happening if you encounter </v>
<v Speaker 2>something anxiety producing is it sends </v>

1120
01:00:50.391 --> 01:00:52.730
<v Speaker 2>a signal up to the right hemisphere and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it says,</v>

1121
01:00:52.731 --> 01:00:53.564
<v Speaker 2>provide a quick and dirty model of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it tells the left hemisphere </v>

1122
01:00:56.420 --> 01:00:57.253
<v Speaker 2>and if you can explore a bunch together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>new information so that we can improve </v>

1123
01:00:59.721 --> 01:01:00.554
<v Speaker 2>the model.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's basically how you're </v>

1124
01:01:02.361 --> 01:01:05.990
<v Speaker 2>responding to novelty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the next thing I'm going to tell you</v>

1125
01:01:06.050 --> 01:01:11.050
<v Speaker 2>not today is two things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is how these hierarchical systems</v>

1126
01:01:13.610 --> 01:01:16.010
<v Speaker 2>emerge across time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how they're interrelated,</v>

1127
01:01:16.250 --> 01:01:17.083
<v Speaker 2>but then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is where we can really move in </v>

1128
01:01:19.911 --> 01:01:23.480
<v Speaker 2>another direction quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to show you how these domains,</v>

1129
01:01:23.481 --> 01:01:26.720
<v Speaker 2>because we've outlined some domains,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the domains are</v>

1130
01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:31.130
<v Speaker 2>things that turn out the way you want </v>
<v Speaker 2>them to,</v>

1131
01:01:32.330 --> 01:01:35.030
<v Speaker 2>things that don't turn out the way you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want them to.</v>

1132
01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:36.553
<v Speaker 2>Structures of representation and modes </v>
<v Speaker 2>of updating that structure of </v>

1133
01:01:40.581 --> 01:01:41.414
<v Speaker 2>representation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can think about those as their </v>

1134
01:01:43.701 --> 01:01:46.340
<v Speaker 2>constants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some things you can predict,</v>

1135
01:01:46.390 --> 01:01:50.300
<v Speaker 2>understand some things you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can explore.</v>

1136
01:01:50.330 --> 01:01:55.330
<v Speaker 2>You can be conventional and there is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>characteristic nature of the domain that</v>

1137
01:01:55.911 --> 01:01:59.090
<v Speaker 2>consists of things that you do not </v>
<v Speaker 2>expect or desire.</v>

1138
01:01:59.570 --> 01:02:04.400
<v Speaker 2>So the next hypothesis is those are the </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that are represented in mythology</v>

1139
01:02:05.030 --> 01:02:07.850
<v Speaker 2>and the reason they're represented is </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there are constants.</v>

1140
01:02:08.630 --> 01:02:09.463
<v Speaker 2>They're always there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what mythology does it isn't </v>

1141
01:02:12.561 --> 01:02:13.394
<v Speaker 2>doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is just what happened is it lays </v>

1142
01:02:15.381 --> 01:02:18.710
<v Speaker 2>out these domains,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it attributes to them certain.</v>

1143
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:24.120
<v Speaker 2>And then it says on average,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's how you should conceptualize them</v>

1144
01:02:24.121 --> 01:02:26.250
<v Speaker 2>and deal with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what stories are.</v>

1145
01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:30.840
<v Speaker 2>So what I'll do next is I'll show you </v>
<v Speaker 2>the symbolic realms.</v>

1146
01:02:31.110 --> 01:02:35.340
<v Speaker 2>And then we can walk through how those </v>
<v Speaker 2>are manifested in stories and you'll see</v>

1147
01:02:35.341 --> 01:02:40.170
<v Speaker 2>that the stories all of a sudden become </v>
<v Speaker 2>alive and that's really cool because the</v>

1148
01:02:40.171 --> 01:02:44.430
<v Speaker 2>stories are really useful and not only </v>
<v Speaker 2>are they useful,</v>

1149
01:02:44.431 --> 01:02:46.530
<v Speaker 2>they're accurate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they actually tell you what to do.</v>

1150
01:02:46.890 --> 01:02:51.890
<v Speaker 2>So and things chaos in order.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1151
01:02:52.930 --> 01:02:53.763
<v Speaker 2>That was to have them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Order is where things that you want to </v>

1152
01:02:56.161 --> 01:02:59.370
<v Speaker 2>happens and chaos is where things you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want to happen.</v>

1153
01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:02.190
<v Speaker 2>And then the next thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>broadly speaking,</v>

1154
01:03:02.191 --> 01:03:06.780
<v Speaker 2>is the thing that mediates between those</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that would be your consciousness.</v>

1155
01:03:07.470 --> 01:03:08.303
<v Speaker 2>And then there's a fourth category which</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a really weird category and it's the </v>

1156
01:03:11.641 --> 01:03:13.950
<v Speaker 2>category from which all those things </v>
<v Speaker 2>emerge.</v>

1157
01:03:14.610 --> 01:03:17.550
<v Speaker 2>So that's a really rough one to get your</v>
<v Speaker 2>head around.</v>

1158
01:03:17.551 --> 01:03:18.870
<v Speaker 2>But it sort of something like this.</v>

1159
01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:20.513
<v Speaker 2>There's unknown things that you can more</v>
<v Speaker 2>or less conceptualize and categorized </v>

1160
01:03:23.860 --> 01:03:27.570
<v Speaker 2>because they're not completely outside </v>
<v Speaker 2>of your experience.</v>

1161
01:03:27.930 --> 01:03:32.910
<v Speaker 2>And then there's the unknown as such.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of like raw potential and that</v>

1162
01:03:32.911 --> 01:03:33.744
<v Speaker 2>potential,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mythology conceptualized is that </v>

1163
01:03:36.061 --> 01:03:38.790
<v Speaker 2>potential as the fundamental bedrock of </v>
<v Speaker 2>being.</v>

1164
01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:42.330
<v Speaker 2>And it assumes that all those other </v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomenon emerge out of it,</v>

1165
01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:46.660
<v Speaker 2>so you emerge out of potential.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a perfectly reasonable way of,</v>

1166
01:03:47.010 --> 01:03:49.350
<v Speaker 2>of thinking about the mythological </v>
<v Speaker 2>representation.</v>

1167
01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:52.170
<v Speaker 2>So we're going to lay those out in </v>
<v Speaker 2>detail.</v>

1168
01:03:52.171 --> 01:03:53.004
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to tell you a bunch of stories</v>
<v Speaker 2>using those categories and walk you </v>

1169
01:03:55.951 --> 01:03:56.784
<v Speaker 2>through it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to tell you how those </v>

1170
01:03:58.051 --> 01:04:00.900
<v Speaker 2>mythological categories are constituted </v>
<v Speaker 2>and what they mean.</v>

1171
01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:04.680
<v Speaker 2>And then we're going to figure out how </v>
<v Speaker 2>they need to relate to one another.</v>

1172
01:04:05.310 --> 01:04:08.670
<v Speaker 2>And so good stories tell you how they </v>
<v Speaker 2>relate to one another.</v>

1173
01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.310
<v Speaker 2>That's what makes them good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1174
01:04:11.311 --> 01:04:12.144
<v Speaker 2>and you know that because otherwise you </v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't know the difference between a </v>

1175
01:04:13.741 --> 01:04:16.110
<v Speaker 2>good story in a bad story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's what's coming up.</v>

1176
01:04:16.111 --> 01:04:19.200
<v Speaker 2>And so hopefully I won't have to go over</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we went over today again,</v>

1177
01:04:19.201 --> 01:04:20.034
<v Speaker 2>but I really need you to get this first </v>
<v Speaker 2>part clear because otherwise when we go </v>

1178
01:04:24.721 --> 01:04:26.760
<v Speaker 2>to the next stage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will make any sense at all.</v>

1179
01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:28.530
<v Speaker 2>So okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go ahead.</v>
