00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.260
<v Speaker 1>Hi Guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>girls and interested others.</v>

2
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.110
<v Speaker 1>I thought I'd give you an update on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>week's events.</v>

3
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.200
<v Speaker 1>I've still been involved in discussions </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the dean of the Faculty of Arts and</v>

4
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.710
<v Speaker 1>Sciences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>David Cameron on the upcoming debate.</v>

5
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.410
<v Speaker 1>And so I thought I'd fill you in on all </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the events,</v>

6
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.280
<v Speaker 1>but first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to make a slight detour.</v>

7
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.760
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that's happened to </v>
<v Speaker 1>me since I put my lectures on youtube is</v>

8
00:00:29.941 --> 00:00:34.941
<v Speaker 1>that I frequently come across people </v>
<v Speaker 1>claiming that high sound a fair bit like</v>

9
00:00:35.311 --> 00:00:38.490
<v Speaker 1>kermit the frog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kermit the frog here.</v>

10
00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:43.030
<v Speaker 2>Hi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

11
00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.030
<v Speaker 2>kermit the frog here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hi.</v>

12
00:00:48.271 --> 00:00:51.480
<v Speaker 2>All kermit the frog here.</v>

13
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.033
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't really sure what to make of </v>

14
00:00:55.361 --> 00:00:56.194
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might not have been my first choice </v>

15
00:00:58.301 --> 00:00:59.134
<v Speaker 1>for animal Avatar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I suppose it could be a lot </v>

16
00:01:01.271 --> 00:01:01.841
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need.</v>

17
00:01:01.841 --> 00:01:02.674
<v Speaker 1>Kermit is a pretty good guy and he's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>decent spokes frog and a and a good </v>

18
00:01:07.421 --> 00:01:09.130
<v Speaker 1>organizer and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of that.</v>

19
00:01:09.131 --> 00:01:11.080
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>

20
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.923
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about that this morning </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I realized something and I think </v>

21
00:01:15.791 --> 00:01:19.240
<v Speaker 1>it's an example of what the psychologist</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carl Jung called synchronicity.</v>

22
00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.223
<v Speaker 1>Synchronicity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The simultaneous occurrence of events </v>

23
00:01:23.261 --> 00:01:25.990
<v Speaker 1>that appear significantly or </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningfully related,</v>

24
00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.570
<v Speaker 1>but have no discernible causal </v>
<v Speaker 1>connection.</v>

25
00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.440
<v Speaker 1>And since I've been engaging in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>free speech campaign,</v>

26
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.140
<v Speaker 1>I have experienced a number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>synchronous event.</v>

27
00:01:35.141 --> 00:01:35.974
<v Speaker 1>So one of them was that when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Canadian Union of Public Employee Queer </v>

28
00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:41.163
<v Speaker 1>Caucus was sent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the University of letter denouncing me </v>

29
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.960
<v Speaker 1>essentially at exactly the same moment </v>
<v Speaker 1>that letter was released.</v>

30
00:01:46.961 --> 00:01:47.794
<v Speaker 1>I had another Canadian Union of Public </v>
<v Speaker 1>Employees President in my office who </v>

31
00:01:51.731 --> 00:01:52.564
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is a representative of one of the </v>

32
00:01:53.771 --> 00:01:54.604
<v Speaker 1>major groups on campus who was talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>to me about his concerns about the new </v>

33
00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.010
<v Speaker 1>university sexual harassment policy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has been formulated in response to</v>

34
00:02:03.011 --> 00:02:03.844
<v Speaker 1>the demands of Kathleen winds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ontario government that threatens to </v>

35
00:02:07.091 --> 00:02:07.924
<v Speaker 1>make normal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's call the misunderstanding social </v>

36
00:02:10.091 --> 00:02:12.790
<v Speaker 1>misunderstandings perhaps of a sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature,</v>

37
00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.210
<v Speaker 1>all equivalent to rape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

38
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.230
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to sexual violence.</v>

39
00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.063
<v Speaker 1>And this qp organization president was </v>
<v Speaker 1>telling me about his concerns that </v>

40
00:02:21.431 --> 00:02:25.120
<v Speaker 1>that's going to put tremendous stress on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the interactions between the people that</v>

41
00:02:25.121 --> 00:02:26.560
<v Speaker 1>he had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has to represent.</v>

42
00:02:26.561 --> 00:02:28.480
<v Speaker 1>So that was an interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>juxtaposition.</v>

43
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.433
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't find anybody in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>University of Admin administration to </v>

44
00:02:31.661 --> 00:02:34.720
<v Speaker 1>properly address his concerns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then the frog issue.</v>

45
00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.070
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's something cool,</v>

46
00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.070
<v Speaker 1>so you'll notice these sculptures behind</v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

47
00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.330
<v Speaker 1>they're made by an artist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a native artist named Charles Joseph,</v>

48
00:02:43.331 --> 00:02:46.330
<v Speaker 1>and Charles Joseph is a friend and now a</v>
<v Speaker 1>brother of mine,</v>

49
00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:47.613
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I've been inducted into their tribal </v>

50
00:02:49.961 --> 00:02:52.000
<v Speaker 1>group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which happened by say,</v>

51
00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:53.163
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same week that I was being accused </v>

52
00:02:54.221 --> 00:02:57.430
<v Speaker 1>of being racist by many people on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>University of Toronto campus.</v>

53
00:02:57.431 --> 00:03:00.490
<v Speaker 1>So that was another major active as far </v>
<v Speaker 1>as I was concerned.</v>

54
00:03:00.491 --> 00:03:01.324
<v Speaker 1>But one thing that's kind of cool is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I had this mask made by Charles </v>

55
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.720
<v Speaker 1>Awhile back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is a frog.</v>

56
00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.490
<v Speaker 1>So there they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

57
00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.370
<v Speaker 1>I've got my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my Kwakwaka'wakw,</v>

58
00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.580
<v Speaker 1>the Kwakwaka'wakw people are tribal </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who live in,</v>

59
00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.843
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

60
00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.853
<v Speaker 1>on the west coast of Vancouver Island.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they have a remarkable artistic </v>

61
00:03:21.981 --> 00:03:23.650
<v Speaker 1>tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I've been very interested in.</v>

62
00:03:23.651 --> 00:03:26.060
<v Speaker 1>And I've had a lot of work done by </v>
<v Speaker 1>Charles who,</v>

63
00:03:26.061 --> 00:03:26.894
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a residential school survivor and he </v>

64
00:03:28.431 --> 00:03:31.670
<v Speaker 1>made this beautiful frog hap for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

65
00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:32.563
<v Speaker 1>and here's something cool too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I asked Charles about the </v>

66
00:03:35.121 --> 00:03:37.790
<v Speaker 1>significance of the frog and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kwakwaka'wakw mythology,</v>

67
00:03:37.791 --> 00:03:41.000
<v Speaker 1>and he said the frog is a harbinger of </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous,</v>

68
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.350
<v Speaker 1>a dangerous times because if anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>pollutes the waters,</v>

69
00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.130
<v Speaker 1>then the frogs disappear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course that did happen almost all</v>

70
00:03:49.131 --> 00:03:51.800
<v Speaker 1>around the world a few years ago because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the frogs,</v>

71
00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.660
<v Speaker 1>frogs have very sensitive skin and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>they pick up anything that,</v>

72
00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.923
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has gone wrong and it interferes </v>

73
00:03:57.051 --> 00:03:59.720
<v Speaker 1>with their ability to reproduce and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>live.</v>

74
00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:01.063
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say that as spokes frog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm announcing that there's something </v>

75
00:04:04.731 --> 00:04:05.564
<v Speaker 1>polluted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>devote the water in which we're all </v>

76
00:04:06.471 --> 00:04:09.500
<v Speaker 1>swimming in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we better clean it up and,</v>

77
00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.450
<v Speaker 1>or there's going to be trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

78
00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.150
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a bit of synchronicity for you.</v>

79
00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:15.133
<v Speaker 1>So what I've been doing this week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because working out the details of the </v>

80
00:04:18.281 --> 00:04:19.570
<v Speaker 1>debate with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

81
00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.970
<v Speaker 1>with the dean of the Faculty of Arts and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Science,</v>

82
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:23.260
<v Speaker 1>David Cameron.</v>

83
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.290
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I met him Monday,</v>

84
00:04:29.291 --> 00:04:33.370
<v Speaker 1>November first in the meeting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He threw a curve ball at me,</v>

85
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:34.690
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

86
00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.140
<v Speaker 1>he said that if the debate was going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go forward,</v>

87
00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:39.850
<v Speaker 1>the university couldn't allow it to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward.</v>

88
00:04:39.851 --> 00:04:40.684
<v Speaker 1>If I was going to repeat my assertion </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I would not use gender neutral </v>

89
00:04:43.871 --> 00:04:47.050
<v Speaker 1>pronouns to refer to people if they </v>
<v Speaker 1>asked me to do so.</v>

90
00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.943
<v Speaker 1>And you may know that the university has</v>
<v Speaker 1>already sent me two warning letters </v>

91
00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.280
<v Speaker 1>telling me that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

92
00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:58.380
<v Speaker 1>my refusal to use these pronouns is in </v>
<v Speaker 1>violation of university policy.</v>

93
00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:00.123
<v Speaker 1>We'll get to that in a while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also contravenes the Ontario Human </v>

94
00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:04.563
<v Speaker 1>Rights Code.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

95
00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.853
<v Speaker 1>and also that as my employer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the university is as responsible for my </v>

96
00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.823
<v Speaker 1>speech acts as I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course I did know that because </v>

97
00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.160
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly why I made the videos to </v>
<v Speaker 1>begin with.</v>

98
00:05:18.161 --> 00:05:20.680
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly what I said in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>videos.</v>

99
00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:25.960
<v Speaker 1>And so the university is distancing </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself from me because they know that if</v>

100
00:05:25.961 --> 00:05:30.100
<v Speaker 1>I get called for my hate speech because </v>
<v Speaker 1>of my refusal to use these pronouns,</v>

101
00:05:30.101 --> 00:05:32.530
<v Speaker 1>than the university is just as guilty as</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am.</v>

102
00:05:32.531 --> 00:05:33.364
<v Speaker 1>So what they're doing is setting up a </v>
<v Speaker 1>series of legal documents that are </v>

103
00:05:36.881 --> 00:05:39.160
<v Speaker 1>designed to show that they acted in good</v>
<v Speaker 1>faith,</v>

104
00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.510
<v Speaker 1>trying to discipline a wayward employee </v>
<v Speaker 1>who is contravening these policies.</v>

105
00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.883
<v Speaker 1>And David implied quite strongly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that with each of those </v>

106
00:05:48.071 --> 00:05:48.904
<v Speaker 1>assertions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability that I will be able to </v>

107
00:05:50.921 --> 00:05:51.754
<v Speaker 1>teach at the University of Toronto come </v>
<v Speaker 1>2017 when I started my undergraduate </v>

108
00:05:55.271 --> 00:05:58.820
<v Speaker 1>teaching is diminishing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I knew that,</v>

109
00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:59.703
<v Speaker 1>but it was still a sharp to hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then of course that put me in a </v>

110
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.013
<v Speaker 1>conundrum because I wasn't sure if it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was reasonable for me to proceed with </v>

111
00:06:05.751 --> 00:06:09.140
<v Speaker 1>the debate if a risk because it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>debate about free speech.</v>

112
00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:14.140
<v Speaker 1>Say if a arbitrary restriction was </v>
<v Speaker 1>placed on what I was able to say.</v>

113
00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:16.363
<v Speaker 1>And so initially I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that I could proceed with the </v>

114
00:06:18.381 --> 00:06:19.214
<v Speaker 1>debate because I really want to talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about bill [inaudible] and issues that </v>

115
00:06:22.641 --> 00:06:26.630
<v Speaker 1>our larger scale than my mirror refusal </v>
<v Speaker 1>to use these pronouns.</v>

116
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.943
<v Speaker 1>But then I went home and I really </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought about it and I talked with my </v>

117
00:06:29.841 --> 00:06:30.674
<v Speaker 1>family because we thought it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>perverse in some sense that in this </v>

118
00:06:34.821 --> 00:06:35.654
<v Speaker 1>debate the debate would begin with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>significant restriction on what I was </v>

119
00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:41.420
<v Speaker 1>allowed to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I wrote a letter,</v>

120
00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:42.950
<v Speaker 1>which I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I'm going to read to you.</v>

121
00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:47.420
<v Speaker 1>I wrote this on on Tuesday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>November second,</v>

122
00:06:47.421 --> 00:06:50.750
<v Speaker 1>and I sent it to American Gertler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's the president of the University of</v>

123
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:52.130
<v Speaker 1>Toronto show band,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nelson,</v>

124
00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.230
<v Speaker 1>Dean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Faculty of Arts and science,</v>

125
00:06:54.231 --> 00:06:55.064
<v Speaker 1>the vice provost who was a signatory of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the second letter I received from the </v>

126
00:06:58.401 --> 00:06:59.234
<v Speaker 1>university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one asking me not to repeat my </v>

127
00:07:00.981 --> 00:07:01.814
<v Speaker 1>assertions anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>asking me to silence myself to Cheryl </v>

128
00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:05.123
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's the vice president and provost to </v>

129
00:07:06.591 --> 00:07:08.900
<v Speaker 1>Kelly Hannah Moffat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vice president,</v>

130
00:07:08.901 --> 00:07:10.280
<v Speaker 1>human resources and equity.</v>

131
00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:11.323
<v Speaker 1>A Hannah Moffitt is still working with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the black liberation collective by the </v>

132
00:07:14.961 --> 00:07:15.794
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite the fact that on their website </v>

133
00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:20.410
<v Speaker 1>they basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they refuse to disavow violence in their</v>

134
00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:23.300
<v Speaker 1>pursuit of social change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also,</v>

135
00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:24.183
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were started and continued to be </v>

136
00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:30.140
<v Speaker 1>strongly influenced by two people have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

137
00:07:30.141 --> 00:07:30.974
<v Speaker 1>dubious reputation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can read about them online if you </v>

138
00:07:32.931 --> 00:07:35.090
<v Speaker 1>want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also Suzanne Ferber,</v>

139
00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.010
<v Speaker 1>who's the chair of the Department of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Psychology,</v>

140
00:07:37.011 --> 00:07:39.650
<v Speaker 1>who gave me the first of the two warning</v>
<v Speaker 1>letters.</v>

141
00:07:39.651 --> 00:07:40.484
<v Speaker 1>So what the university is doing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>setting themselves up so that if I'm </v>

142
00:07:43.401 --> 00:07:45.890
<v Speaker 1>taken to court and they're taking the </v>
<v Speaker 1>court along with me,</v>

143
00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:50.300
<v Speaker 1>then they can claim that they've done </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything they possibly can to reign in</v>

144
00:07:50.301 --> 00:07:51.111
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

145
00:07:51.111 --> 00:07:51.944
<v Speaker 1>this abusive professor who refuses to </v>
<v Speaker 1>let other people determine the words </v>

146
00:07:55.311 --> 00:07:57.620
<v Speaker 1>that he says.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

147
00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:01.670
<v Speaker 1>so this is the letter I wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dear Dean Cameron yesterday.</v>

148
00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:02.953
<v Speaker 1>You indicated that if the debate where </v>
<v Speaker 1>to proceed and if I repeated my </v>

149
00:08:06.171 --> 00:08:10.070
<v Speaker 1>insistence that I would not use gender </v>
<v Speaker 1>neutral pronouns during that debate,</v>

150
00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:13.760
<v Speaker 1>the university would find itself in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>untenable legal position.</v>

151
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:15.343
<v Speaker 1>This is because number one use of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronouns is mandated by university </v>

152
00:08:19.761 --> 00:08:20.594
<v Speaker 1>policy and the Ontario Human Rights Act </v>
<v Speaker 1>and its surrounding policies as laid </v>

153
00:08:24.351 --> 00:08:25.131
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

154
00:08:25.131 --> 00:08:28.370
<v Speaker 1>on the Ontario Human Rights Commission </v>
<v Speaker 1>website and two,</v>

155
00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:29.443
<v Speaker 1>under those laws and policies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>employers are responsible for the </v>

156
00:08:32.001 --> 00:08:35.930
<v Speaker 1>statements of their employees as if they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were making the statements themselves.</v>

157
00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.740
<v Speaker 1>Thus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the university hosts this debate,</v>

158
00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:40.783
<v Speaker 1>providing me with a platform for my </v>
<v Speaker 1>views and I restated my intention to </v>

159
00:08:44.511 --> 00:08:45.344
<v Speaker 1>refuse use of the mandated pronouns and </v>
<v Speaker 1>legal action and sued the university </v>

160
00:08:49.851 --> 00:08:50.684
<v Speaker 1>would not have properly upheld its legal</v>
<v Speaker 1>obligation to ensure that its employees </v>

161
00:08:54.231 --> 00:08:59.231
<v Speaker 1>follow the requisite laws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You also indicated that if I continue to</v>

162
00:08:59.821 --> 00:09:02.730
<v Speaker 1>insist publicly that I will not use the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mandated pronouns.</v>

163
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:07.230
<v Speaker 1>The university may also be required to </v>
<v Speaker 1>suspend my courses beginning in January.</v>

164
00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:09.353
<v Speaker 1>You suggested therefore that I agree </v>
<v Speaker 1>during the debate not to repeat my </v>

165
00:09:13.321 --> 00:09:14.154
<v Speaker 1>refusal to use gender neutral pronouns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so as not to further compromise the </v>

166
00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.860
<v Speaker 1>university and to allow the debate to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>forward.</v>

167
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:25.700
<v Speaker 1>I sat at our meeting that I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>consider this and I have.</v>

168
00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:27.523
<v Speaker 1>I cannot abide by this request.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of the discussion that needs to be </v>

169
00:09:30.321 --> 00:09:35.321
<v Speaker 1>had during it outside of the debate is </v>
<v Speaker 1>precisely what the university should do.</v>

170
00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:36.950
<v Speaker 1>Because of my refusal.</v>

171
00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.810
<v Speaker 1>Here are the options.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>

172
00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:46.120
<v Speaker 1>the university can consist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>continue to insist upon my silence based</v>

173
00:09:46.121 --> 00:09:48.910
<v Speaker 1>on its understanding that my actions are</v>
<v Speaker 1>currently legal.</v>

174
00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:50.563
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Based on its understanding that my </v>

175
00:09:51.881 --> 00:09:55.930
<v Speaker 1>actions are currently illegal</v>
<v Speaker 1>on its concern,</v>

176
00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:56.793
<v Speaker 1>a bit refusing to use gender neutral </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronouns is illegal and more precisely </v>

177
00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:07.120
<v Speaker 1>be that my statement that I would refuse</v>
<v Speaker 1>to use them if asked is also illegal.</v>

178
00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:11.770
<v Speaker 1>It can then take continue to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever actions that deems necessary to</v>

179
00:10:11.771 --> 00:10:16.720
<v Speaker 1>distance itself from me and my opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Option two,</v>

180
00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:20.533
<v Speaker 1>the university can reaffirm its </v>
<v Speaker 1>commitment to its statement on freedom </v>

181
00:10:23.421 --> 00:10:26.570
<v Speaker 1>of speech written in May 19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>92,</v>

182
00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:27.823
<v Speaker 1>which explicitly states that quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the essential purpose of the university </v>

183
00:10:31.191 --> 00:10:34.550
<v Speaker 1>is to engage in the pursuit of truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the advancement of learning,</v>

184
00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:39.050
<v Speaker 1>and the dissemination of knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To achieve this purpose,</v>

185
00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:40.183
<v Speaker 1>all members of the university must have </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a prerequisite freedom of speech and </v>

186
00:10:43.281 --> 00:10:44.114
<v Speaker 1>expression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means the right to examine </v>

187
00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:48.200
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>investigate,</v>

188
00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:49.243
<v Speaker 1>speculate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and comment on any issue without </v>

189
00:10:52.131 --> 00:10:56.890
<v Speaker 1>reference to prescribe doctrine as well </v>
<v Speaker 1>as the right to criticize the university</v>

190
00:10:56.891 --> 00:10:57.724
<v Speaker 1>and society at large.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The existence of an institution were </v>

191
00:11:02.391 --> 00:11:06.410
<v Speaker 1>unorthodox ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alternative modes of thinking and living</v>

192
00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:09.530
<v Speaker 1>and radical prescriptions for social </v>
<v Speaker 1>ills can be debated,</v>

193
00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:12.140
<v Speaker 1>contributes immensely to social and </v>
<v Speaker 1>political change,</v>

194
00:11:12.141 --> 00:11:15.830
<v Speaker 1>and the advancement of human rights both</v>
<v Speaker 1>inside and outside the university.</v>

195
00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:17.893
<v Speaker 1>Often this debate may generate </v>
<v Speaker 1>controversy and disputes among members </v>

196
00:11:20.721 --> 00:11:22.610
<v Speaker 1>of the university and the wider </v>
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>

197
00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:24.253
<v Speaker 1>In such cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the universities primary obligation is </v>

198
00:11:27.681 --> 00:11:29.900
<v Speaker 1>to protect the free speech of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved.</v>

199
00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:33.500
<v Speaker 1>The university must allow the fullest </v>
<v Speaker 1>range of debate.</v>

200
00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:38.090
<v Speaker 1>It should not limit that debate by </v>
<v Speaker 1>preordained and conclusions or punishing</v>

201
00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:41.510
<v Speaker 1>or inhibiting the reasonable exercise of</v>
<v Speaker 1>free speech.</v>

202
00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:48.700
<v Speaker 1>And I said the university must decide it</v>
<v Speaker 1>can express option one,</v>

203
00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:50.713
<v Speaker 1>which in my opinion means sacrificing </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's commitment to free speech as </v>

204
00:11:53.711 --> 00:11:54.544
<v Speaker 1>expressly laid out in the aforementioned</v>
<v Speaker 1>statement or it can accept option to </v>

205
00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:00.483
<v Speaker 1>defending my right to quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>criticize the university and society at </v>

206
00:12:04.121 --> 00:12:07.480
<v Speaker 1>large and quote by all legal means </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary.</v>

207
00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:08.763
<v Speaker 1>This would mean throwing it support </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind me and fighting the restrictive </v>

208
00:12:12.431 --> 00:12:17.410
<v Speaker 1>legislation on embodied in the Ontario </v>
<v Speaker 1>Human Rights Act and associated policies</v>

209
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:19.870
<v Speaker 1>and soon to be instantiated in federal </v>
<v Speaker 1>bill.</v>

210
00:12:19.871 --> 00:12:24.760
<v Speaker 1>See 16 all the way to the Supreme Court </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Canada if necessary.</v>

211
00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:31.120
<v Speaker 1>I understand that the statement also </v>
<v Speaker 1>says that quote,</v>

212
00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:31.983
<v Speaker 1>the purpose of the university also </v>
<v Speaker 1>depends on an environment of tolerance </v>

213
00:12:34.691 --> 00:12:37.900
<v Speaker 1>and mutual respect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every member should be able to work,</v>

214
00:12:37.901 --> 00:12:38.560
<v Speaker 1>live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>teach,</v>

215
00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:39.393
<v Speaker 1>and learn in university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>free from discrimination and harassment </v>

216
00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:42.943
<v Speaker 1>and quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my actions have been deemed by some to </v>

217
00:12:47.291 --> 00:12:48.124
<v Speaker 1>constitute discrimination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the two major principles outlined in </v>

218
00:12:51.641 --> 00:12:52.474
<v Speaker 1>the statement or now in conflict and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>university and our society at large has </v>

219
00:12:58.181 --> 00:13:02.830
<v Speaker 1>to decide which one takes priority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As Professor Jonathan Haidt,</v>

220
00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:03.693
<v Speaker 1>professor of ethical leadership at Nyu </v>
<v Speaker 1>Stern School of business recently </v>

221
00:13:06.911 --> 00:13:07.744
<v Speaker 1>indicated in the US universities must </v>
<v Speaker 1>choose one t loss that's guiding </v>

222
00:13:12.791 --> 00:13:15.160
<v Speaker 1>principle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social justice</v>

223
00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:17.683
<v Speaker 1>or truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have similarly juxtapose social </v>

224
00:13:22.571 --> 00:13:26.410
<v Speaker 1>justice and freedom of expression and </v>
<v Speaker 1>chose the latter.</v>

225
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.180
<v Speaker 1>Make your decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've made mine.</v>

226
00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:35.410
<v Speaker 1>May God himself help us live with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>

227
00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:41.440
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jonathan Haidt.</v>

228
00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:43.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to read you a little bit about</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he wrote.</v>

229
00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:46.960
<v Speaker 1>He wrote this last week and all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All set.</v>

230
00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:50.050
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All set up the link and the video in the</v>

231
00:13:50.051 --> 00:13:51.820
<v Speaker 1>comments on this video so you can look </v>
<v Speaker 1>at it.</v>

232
00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:53.133
<v Speaker 1>Jonathan Haidt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's very good political psychologist </v>

233
00:13:54.821 --> 00:13:55.654
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>says no university can have truth and </v>

234
00:13:59.021 --> 00:14:03.040
<v Speaker 1>social justice as dual t locis final </v>
<v Speaker 1>goals.</v>

235
00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:08.680
<v Speaker 1>John Stuart Mill is the patron saint of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what all call Truth University,</v>

236
00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:09.753
<v Speaker 1>which sees truth as a process in which </v>
<v Speaker 1>flawed individuals challenge each </v>

237
00:14:12.881 --> 00:14:17.881
<v Speaker 1>other's biased and incomplete reasoning </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the process all become smarter</v>

238
00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:20.583
<v Speaker 1>truth you dies when it becomes </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual uniform or politically </v>

239
00:14:23.231 --> 00:14:24.064
<v Speaker 1>orthodox.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Karl Marx is the patron saint of social </v>

240
00:14:28.061 --> 00:14:28.894
<v Speaker 1>justice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you which is oriented around changing </v>

241
00:14:30.821 --> 00:14:34.990
<v Speaker 1>the world in part by overthrowing power </v>
<v Speaker 1>structures and privilege.</v>

242
00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:38.560
<v Speaker 1>It sees political diversity as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>obstacle to action.</v>

243
00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:43.660
<v Speaker 1>Each university must pick one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

244
00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:46.540
<v Speaker 1>so now David Cameron,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Dean,</v>

245
00:14:46.541 --> 00:14:49.360
<v Speaker 1>wrote me back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the same day,</v>

246
00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:50.403
<v Speaker 1>which is what I requested and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have reviewed your letter dated </v>

247
00:14:53.991 --> 00:14:56.120
<v Speaker 1>November second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2016.</v>

248
00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:59.540
<v Speaker 1>I do not agree with the way that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have framed our conversation,</v>

249
00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:00.583
<v Speaker 1>which was a good faith attempt to find a</v>
<v Speaker 1>way to identify a terms of reference </v>

250
00:15:03.351 --> 00:15:04.184
<v Speaker 1>that would allow for you as an academic </v>
<v Speaker 1>to engage in a discussion about your </v>

251
00:15:07.521 --> 00:15:08.354
<v Speaker 1>views regarding the provisions of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ontario Human Rights Code that it </v>

252
00:15:10.911 --> 00:15:14.660
<v Speaker 1>protected against discrimination based </v>
<v Speaker 1>on gender identity and gender expression</v>

253
00:15:14.661 --> 00:15:15.494
<v Speaker 1>since 2012.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the similar legislation in </v>

254
00:15:18.231 --> 00:15:22.010
<v Speaker 1>Ontario as well as similar amendments </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are being considered federally.</v>

255
00:15:22.011 --> 00:15:22.844
<v Speaker 1>In Bill [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>David repeats his commitment to the to </v>

256
00:15:27.791 --> 00:15:32.700
<v Speaker 1>the forum or the university is quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>prepared to host a forum where arguments</v>

257
00:15:32.701 --> 00:15:33.534
<v Speaker 1>are presented concerning the gender </v>
<v Speaker 1>identity and gender expression </v>

258
00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:37.470
<v Speaker 1>protections of the Ontario Human Rights </v>
<v Speaker 1>Code,</v>

259
00:15:37.471 --> 00:15:39.900
<v Speaker 1>or those being considered under bill </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

260
00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:42.163
<v Speaker 1>Arguments are presented concerning </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom of expression and how it should </v>

261
00:15:44.241 --> 00:15:48.380
<v Speaker 1>properly relate to nondiscrimination </v>
<v Speaker 1>protections that exist in Canadian law.</v>

262
00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:50.173
<v Speaker 1>Arguments are presented as to any </v>
<v Speaker 1>alternatives that might be preferable </v>

263
00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:54.193
<v Speaker 1>and slash or discussing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to and respond to arguments of </v>

264
00:15:56.811 --> 00:15:59.360
<v Speaker 1>colleagues who may have different views </v>
<v Speaker 1>on these subjects.</v>

265
00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:02.963
<v Speaker 1>The university cannot host a forum that </v>
<v Speaker 1>will offer a platform for an expressed </v>

266
00:16:07.531 --> 00:16:08.364
<v Speaker 1>intention to engage in conduct with your</v>
<v Speaker 1>students and colleagues that you </v>

267
00:16:10.831 --> 00:16:13.530
<v Speaker 1>appeared to have Nolan acknowledged </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have been in,</v>

268
00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:16.140
<v Speaker 1>would be in violation of the Ontario </v>
<v Speaker 1>Human Rights Code.</v>

269
00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:18.553
<v Speaker 1>If you wish to engage in a further </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion about this way of proceeding </v>

270
00:16:20.961 --> 00:16:23.960
<v Speaker 1>with the scholarly forum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would be glad to receive your written</v>

271
00:16:23.961 --> 00:16:25.430
<v Speaker 1>comments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yours sincerely.</v>

272
00:16:25.431 --> 00:16:27.270
<v Speaker 1>David Cameron,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dean,</v>

273
00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:30.420
<v Speaker 1>Faculty Arts and Science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

274
00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:34.850
<v Speaker 1>I slept on that and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

275
00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.710
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll tell you what I decided to do.</v>

276
00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:39.773
<v Speaker 1>So I talked about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talked it over again with my family and </v>

277
00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:46.200
<v Speaker 1>some friends who have been following </v>
<v Speaker 1>this and who are wise people.</v>

278
00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:47.513
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I also thought about this in </v>

279
00:16:51.021 --> 00:16:54.200
<v Speaker 1>mythological terms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'll give you the context of that.</v>

280
00:16:54.201 --> 00:16:55.034
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

281
00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:57.013
<v Speaker 1>one of the oldest stories we have got to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the story in genesis indicates that the </v>

282
00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:06.230
<v Speaker 1>environments that people find themselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>in at an architectural level.</v>

283
00:17:06.231 --> 00:17:09.530
<v Speaker 1>So this is all human environments could </v>
<v Speaker 1>be likened to a garden,</v>

284
00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:13.790
<v Speaker 1>a walled garden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a is a means walled garden.</v>

285
00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:16.430
<v Speaker 1>An Eden means well watered place by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

286
00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:17.743
<v Speaker 1>And so genesis presents the proper </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment for human beings as a a </v>

287
00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:25.190
<v Speaker 1>garden with walls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a well watered garden with walls and</v>

288
00:17:25.191 --> 00:17:26.024
<v Speaker 1>so that's a combination of of of culture</v>
<v Speaker 1>and nature that the walls are culture </v>

289
00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:32.930
<v Speaker 1>and the garden itself is nature and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings lived in a,</v>

290
00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:34.183
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in an environment that's always partly </v>

291
00:17:36.171 --> 00:17:37.004
<v Speaker 1>nature and partly culture and those two </v>
<v Speaker 1>things need to be kept in proper </v>

292
00:17:40.761 --> 00:17:41.594
<v Speaker 1>balance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing about the garden is that </v>

293
00:17:43.041 --> 00:17:45.220
<v Speaker 1>there's always a snake in the garden and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

294
00:17:45.221 --> 00:17:47.810
<v Speaker 1>It's like the idea that there's a snake </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the garden.</v>

295
00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:51.000
<v Speaker 1>There is the idea that nothing can exist</v>
<v Speaker 1>without,</v>

296
00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:51.953
<v Speaker 1>without a flaw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing can actually exist that doesn't </v>

297
00:17:54.451 --> 00:17:59.451
<v Speaker 1>have a serious flaw and the same ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>expressed in certain Asian ideas.</v>

298
00:17:59.731 --> 00:18:00.564
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Buddhist beautiful Buddhist Gardens </v>

299
00:18:02.641 --> 00:18:07.641
<v Speaker 1>in Japan very carefully manicured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always have a flaw as often do a certain</v>

300
00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:10.553
<v Speaker 1>forms of Japanese pottery and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>expresses the same idea that that </v>

301
00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:18.000
<v Speaker 1>reality to exist must be allowed to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>its flaws.</v>

302
00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:20.010
<v Speaker 1>And the Yin and Yang symbol is like that</v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

303
00:18:20.011 --> 00:18:22.530
<v Speaker 1>Because in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the chaos serpent,</v>

304
00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:23.393
<v Speaker 1>there's a white dot that indicates that </v>
<v Speaker 1>in every chaotic circumstance order can </v>

305
00:18:27.331 --> 00:18:30.270
<v Speaker 1>emerge and in the and in the white </v>
<v Speaker 1>serpent,</v>

306
00:18:30.271 --> 00:18:31.104
<v Speaker 1>there's a block dot which indicates that</v>
<v Speaker 1>in every orderly place that a chaotic </v>

307
00:18:34.891 --> 00:18:35.724
<v Speaker 1>element can emerge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't get away from the tension </v>

308
00:18:38.461 --> 00:18:39.690
<v Speaker 1>of opposites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I thought,</v>

309
00:18:39.691 --> 00:18:40.524
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's necessary for this debate to </v>

310
00:18:42.601 --> 00:18:45.980
<v Speaker 1>proceed because it's important and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I want the,</v>

311
00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:47.093
<v Speaker 1>the topics here to be aired properly and</v>
<v Speaker 1>thoroughly and it would be better for </v>

312
00:18:51.601 --> 00:18:52.610
<v Speaker 1>the university to host it.</v>

313
00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:53.453
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I very seriously considered renting a </v>

314
00:18:55.051 --> 00:18:58.080
<v Speaker 1>theater and just making my views known </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

315
00:18:58.081 --> 00:18:58.914
<v Speaker 1>But I thought that's not as good as </v>
<v Speaker 1>having the other side have it's </v>

316
00:19:02.851 --> 00:19:06.420
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to have their concerns </v>
<v Speaker 1>noted.</v>

317
00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:11.010
<v Speaker 1>And I agreed that I would provide my </v>
<v Speaker 1>arguments,</v>

318
00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:15.450
<v Speaker 1>at least an outline of my arguments to </v>
<v Speaker 1>my opposition,</v>

319
00:19:15.451 --> 00:19:16.284
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or to the people on the other side of </v>

320
00:19:17.101 --> 00:19:17.934
<v Speaker 1>the discussion beforehand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that they had a chance to marshal </v>

321
00:19:19.621 --> 00:19:20.454
<v Speaker 1>their arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I decided that despite this </v>

322
00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:24.863
<v Speaker 1>restriction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is still the precise nature of </v>

323
00:19:28.381 --> 00:19:31.320
<v Speaker 1>which is still to be determined,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it would be better,</v>

324
00:19:31.321 --> 00:19:34.860
<v Speaker 1>all things considered to go ahead with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the debate.</v>

325
00:19:34.861 --> 00:19:35.694
<v Speaker 1>And so it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like it's likely to occur </v>

326
00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:41.460
<v Speaker 1>sometime in the next two weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

327
00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:45.030
<v Speaker 1>and that's that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I would like to close by noting that</v>

328
00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:47.640
<v Speaker 1>the university appears to have made its </v>
<v Speaker 1>choice.</v>

329
00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:52.680
<v Speaker 1>And when I met David on Friday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had a somewhat more heated exchange,</v>

330
00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:56.190
<v Speaker 1>still friendly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

331
00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:57.833
<v Speaker 1>where I suggested that the university is</v>
<v Speaker 1>making a big mistake here and that they </v>

332
00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:05.970
<v Speaker 1>have to make a decision as Jonathan </v>
<v Speaker 1>Haidt said about which side they're on.</v>

333
00:20:05.971 --> 00:20:06.804
<v Speaker 1>And that if the university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the university has substantial legal </v>

334
00:20:08.581 --> 00:20:11.910
<v Speaker 1>resources and if they were as concerned </v>
<v Speaker 1>about free speech as I think they should</v>

335
00:20:11.911 --> 00:20:14.430
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as their own policy,</v>

336
00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:16.530
<v Speaker 1>which I'm supposed to abide by by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

337
00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:17.853
<v Speaker 1>Because because I'm supposed to abide by</v>
<v Speaker 1>university policies that the university </v>

338
00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:22.373
<v Speaker 1>policy on free speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is its highest order </v>

339
00:20:24.781 --> 00:20:28.230
<v Speaker 1>policy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suggests that I have the right.</v>

340
00:20:28.231 --> 00:20:29.064
<v Speaker 1>Or perhaps maybe even the obligation to </v>
<v Speaker 1>criticize the university and society at </v>

341
00:20:32.131 --> 00:20:32.964
<v Speaker 1>large without,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without reference to any preordained </v>

342
00:20:35.911 --> 00:20:38.270
<v Speaker 1>conclusions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I,</v>

343
00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:42.640
<v Speaker 1>I strongly suggested to David that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

344
00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:45.210
<v Speaker 1>the university is on the wrong side of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

345
00:20:45.211 --> 00:20:46.044
<v Speaker 1>that they picked the side of the social </v>
<v Speaker 1>warriors over this side of freedom of </v>

346
00:20:49.571 --> 00:20:50.404
<v Speaker 1>expression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or perhaps even as Jonathan Haidt has </v>

347
00:20:51.971 --> 00:20:52.804
<v Speaker 1>pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps even over truth and that that's </v>

348
00:20:55.211 --> 00:20:56.044
<v Speaker 1>a huge mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're violating the most </v>

349
00:20:57.641 --> 00:21:00.850
<v Speaker 1>fundamental principle upon which the </v>
<v Speaker 1>university is predicated.</v>

350
00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:03.220
<v Speaker 1>And I sincerely believe that to be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>case,</v>

351
00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:04.653
<v Speaker 1>but I've decided to go forward with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>debate because I believe that a flawed </v>

352
00:21:08.831 --> 00:21:09.664
<v Speaker 1>debate is better than none.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And perhaps all you can hope for in the </v>

353
00:21:13.001 --> 00:21:18.001
<v Speaker 1>world of actuality is a flawed process </v>
<v Speaker 1>that can grow and struggle.</v>

354
00:21:18.701 --> 00:21:19.534
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wretchedly and awkwardly towards </v>

355
00:21:22.541 --> 00:21:25.420
<v Speaker 1>something that might be regarded as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>

356
00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:28.510
<v Speaker 1>So make no mistake about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what's happened.</v>

357
00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:29.703
<v Speaker 1>The university has drawn the lines and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have decided that if they have to </v>

358
00:21:34.391 --> 00:21:38.200
<v Speaker 1>support political correctness slash </v>
<v Speaker 1>social justice,</v>

359
00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:41.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neo Marxism or freedom of speech,</v>

360
00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:44.950
<v Speaker 1>then they're going to pick the former.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And not the latter,</v>

361
00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:46.023
<v Speaker 1>and so that's the state of the art at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada's perhaps Canada's greatest </v>

362
00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:54.130
<v Speaker 1>educational institution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say that's also the,</v>

363
00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:58.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a diagnostic indicator of the,</v>

364
00:21:58.810 --> 00:21:59.643
<v Speaker 1>shall we call it the state of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>polluted water works that make up our </v>

365
00:22:04.511 --> 00:22:09.160
<v Speaker 1>current culture and as spokes frog for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the nation.</v>

366
00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:13.540
<v Speaker 1>Let's say I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm stating quite bluntly,</v>

367
00:22:13.541 --> 00:22:17.350
<v Speaker 1>that we better clean up our act or </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be hell to pay.</v>

368
00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:22.873
<v Speaker 3>It's not easy being green</v>
<v Speaker 3>having to spend each day the color of </v>

369
00:22:31.581 --> 00:22:36.581
<v Speaker 3>the leaves</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I think it might be nicer being red</v>

370
00:22:38.871 --> 00:22:43.750
<v Speaker 3>or yellow or gold or copper,</v>
<v Speaker 3>much more colorful light.</v>

371
00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:44.613
<v Speaker 3>Then.</v>
