00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.520
<v Speaker 1>These are stopping Jordan Peterson.</v>

2
00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:05.683
<v Speaker 2>Thank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are there differences between men and </v>

3
00:00:16.631 --> 00:00:18.690
<v Speaker 2>women?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

4
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:19.760
<v Speaker 2>Perfect.</v>

5
00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:28.203
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing I've noticed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I actually mentioned this at the </v>

6
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.000
<v Speaker 1>University of Toronto,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the baby with someone who was</v>

7
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.353
<v Speaker 1>thinking about this for quite a while </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there was an overwhelming majority </v>

8
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.120
<v Speaker 1>of men in the room at the University of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Toronto and if you look around</v>

9
00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:45.663
<v Speaker 1>you'll see that it's probably running,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say about 1910 and that's </v>

10
00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.690
<v Speaker 1>remarkable because there are more women </v>
<v Speaker 1>than men in universities now and so it's</v>

11
00:00:55.001 --> 00:00:58.730
<v Speaker 1>been quite interesting to me to see the </v>
<v Speaker 1>public parks.</v>

12
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.130
<v Speaker 1>The vast majority of people are also the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are watching on youtube.</v>

13
00:01:03.131 --> 00:01:08.131
<v Speaker 1>It's about 90 10 as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not exactly sure why that is.</v>

14
00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.870
<v Speaker 1>Although I think maybe that nobody is </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually speaking to,</v>

15
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'm doing a bit of that and I will</v>

16
00:01:17.201 --> 00:01:18.034
<v Speaker 1>say that's probably also really good for</v>
<v Speaker 1>women because men aren't doing very </v>

17
00:01:21.161 --> 00:01:21.994
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can be sure that women aren't going </v>

18
00:01:22.841 --> 00:01:26.740
<v Speaker 1>to do very well because as it turns out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you actually meet each other.</v>

19
00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.410
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to start again.</v>

20
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.543
<v Speaker 1>I guess talking about bills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's 16 and I know I made some videos </v>

21
00:01:35.801 --> 00:01:36.634
<v Speaker 1>back at the end of September.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose most people you know that one </v>

22
00:01:39.851 --> 00:01:44.230
<v Speaker 1>of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless I'm expressing my concern about a</v>

23
00:01:44.231 --> 00:01:45.064
<v Speaker 1>piece of legislation at the federal </v>
<v Speaker 1>level called Bill Sixteen and it was </v>

24
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:50.723
<v Speaker 1>boring to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was to add gender expression and gender </v>

25
00:01:52.361 --> 00:01:54.510
<v Speaker 1>identity to the list of protected </v>
<v Speaker 1>groups,</v>

26
00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.903
<v Speaker 1>predictability to the relevant human </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights legislation and also making it </v>

27
00:02:00.521 --> 00:02:01.354
<v Speaker 1>harassment and discrimination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something intentionally addressable </v>

28
00:02:04.691 --> 00:02:05.524
<v Speaker 1>under the hate crimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>permission of the criminal code on a </v>

29
00:02:08.861 --> 00:02:09.694
<v Speaker 1>surface of it very skirt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shorter bill wasn't turns out on the </v>

30
00:02:12.971 --> 00:02:16.510
<v Speaker 1>surface it looks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it's very bad with formula,</v>

31
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.020
<v Speaker 1>the first major errors of course the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gender expression,</v>

32
00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.883
<v Speaker 1>which is fundamentally fashion choices </v>
<v Speaker 1>defined onto her human rights </v>

33
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.330
<v Speaker 1>conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>websites.</v>

34
00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:26.343
<v Speaker 1>It's how you present yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you present yourself in terms of </v>

35
00:02:30.041 --> 00:02:30.874
<v Speaker 1>your clothing and your fashion and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>hair and makeup and that sort of thing </v>

36
00:02:34.091 --> 00:02:35.170
<v Speaker 1>in day to day activity.</v>

37
00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.230
<v Speaker 1>It's shouldn't be too unreasonable </v>
<v Speaker 1>walked out with it.</v>

38
00:02:38.231 --> 00:02:39.064
<v Speaker 1>That does not constitute a group and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually a bit of a stickler when it </v>

39
00:02:42.281 --> 00:02:43.114
<v Speaker 1>comes to language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think especially when we're making </v>

40
00:02:44.921 --> 00:02:45.754
<v Speaker 1>legislation that we should be laws that </v>
<v Speaker 1>say exactly what they should say and </v>

41
00:02:48.311 --> 00:02:49.144
<v Speaker 1>nothing else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and since gender expression is not </v>

42
00:02:51.821 --> 00:02:52.654
<v Speaker 1>approved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it strikes me as very difficult to </v>

43
00:02:53.921 --> 00:02:57.630
<v Speaker 1>determine exactly how it's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>added as a group to the protected groups</v>

44
00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.780
<v Speaker 1>under the relevant to human rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But more than that,</v>

45
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.170
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

46
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.170
<v Speaker 1>it's quite self.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's quite almost,</v>

47
00:03:07.171 --> 00:03:08.880
<v Speaker 1>and I've talked to a number of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this,</v>

48
00:03:08.881 --> 00:03:09.714
<v Speaker 1>so I know it's not just my imagination </v>
<v Speaker 1>then bill [inaudible] and legislation </v>

49
00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:13.984
<v Speaker 1>like it are going to be interpreted in </v>
<v Speaker 1>light of the policies that the Ontario </v>

50
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:18.753
<v Speaker 1>Human Rights Commission has developed a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the urine absolutely incoherent set of </v>

51
00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.450
<v Speaker 1>palsy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never seen one.</v>

52
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.030
<v Speaker 1>And that's why the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first video,</v>

53
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.650
<v Speaker 1>the second video I made because </v>
<v Speaker 1>University of Toronto and its wisdom,</v>

54
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:30.503
<v Speaker 1>the HR and equity people decided that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was okay to force their employees to </v>

55
00:03:34.601 --> 00:03:38.200
<v Speaker 1>undergo mandatory anti unconscious bias </v>
<v Speaker 1>training.</v>

56
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.033
<v Speaker 1>Which is something I have a big problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>with given that you can't diagnose </v>

57
00:03:42.041 --> 00:03:46.120
<v Speaker 1>someone's unconscious bias first of all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even if you couldn't,</v>

58
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.020
<v Speaker 1>there's no evidence whatsoever that </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious bias retreading will help.</v>

59
00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:50.854
<v Speaker 1>And find them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no reason whatsoever by your </v>

60
00:03:53.021 --> 00:03:54.400
<v Speaker 1>employer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter who they are,</v>

61
00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:55.234
<v Speaker 1>should be messing about with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental perceptual structures of </v>

62
00:03:57.491 --> 00:03:58.870
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your psyche,</v>

63
00:03:58.871 --> 00:04:01.420
<v Speaker 1>especially when they're looking at </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that aren't even volunteered.</v>

64
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.700
<v Speaker 1>So it's appalling on multiple </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensions.</v>

65
00:04:03.701 --> 00:04:04.534
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things I would seriously </v>
<v Speaker 1>recommend to all of you is that if </v>

66
00:04:06.551 --> 00:04:07.384
<v Speaker 1>anybody starts to suggest that you need </v>
<v Speaker 1>to undergo mandatory retraining through </v>

67
00:04:11.441 --> 00:04:14.440
<v Speaker 1>your unconscious racial biases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you go along with that,</v>

68
00:04:14.441 --> 00:04:15.274
<v Speaker 1>you're immediately admitting that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sort of biggest who needs to be </v>

69
00:04:17.261 --> 00:04:18.094
<v Speaker 1>retrained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would think very carefully about </v>

70
00:04:19.901 --> 00:04:23.290
<v Speaker 1>admitting them because first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's possible that it's not true.</v>

71
00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:24.281
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

72
00:04:24.281 --> 00:04:26.710
<v Speaker 1>people carry with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every carries with them,</v>

73
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.810
<v Speaker 1>certainly in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in group preference.</v>

74
00:04:28.811 --> 00:04:29.644
<v Speaker 1>That's quite common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What exactly that means in terms of </v>

75
00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.150
<v Speaker 1>their overt behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

76
00:04:34.151 --> 00:04:37.690
<v Speaker 1>proclivities is completely undetermined </v>
<v Speaker 1>by the relevant science.</v>

77
00:04:37.691 --> 00:04:38.524
<v Speaker 1>And there's absolutely no excuse for </v>
<v Speaker 1>social psychologists to be putting </v>

78
00:04:41.231 --> 00:04:42.064
<v Speaker 1>forward tests like the implicit </v>
<v Speaker 1>association task which purport to </v>

79
00:04:44.921 --> 00:04:48.820
<v Speaker 1>measure unconscious bias as a diagnosed </v>
<v Speaker 1>against them because they don't have the</v>

80
00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:51.510
<v Speaker 1>validity and reliability that we put </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward as such.</v>

81
00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.353
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you are a clinical psychologist and </v>

82
00:04:53.921 --> 00:04:56.860
<v Speaker 1>you were using tests that sort of to </v>
<v Speaker 1>diagnose individuals,</v>

83
00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.510
<v Speaker 1>you'd be in violation of the statutes </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are governing private practice.</v>

84
00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.760
<v Speaker 1>So I have my reasons for objecting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>these studies.</v>

85
00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:06.303
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I really don't like about bill see </v>

86
00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.140
<v Speaker 1>16 and its surrounding policies is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

87
00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.043
<v Speaker 1>It's putting into our law a sequence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions that actually happened </v>

88
00:05:15.971 --> 00:05:19.630
<v Speaker 1>to be false and it was me and pointing </v>
<v Speaker 1>out that they were false.</v>

89
00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:20.463
<v Speaker 1>That's got me in whatever trouble I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>been in and generate the accusations of </v>

90
00:05:24.251 --> 00:05:27.620
<v Speaker 1>such things as Trans Phobia and racism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are.</v>

91
00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how racism got into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>picture at all because.</v>

92
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.843
<v Speaker 1>Because I complained about the insane </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals who are running black lives </v>

93
00:05:35.711 --> 00:05:37.250
<v Speaker 1>matter Toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I have,</v>

94
00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:38.123
<v Speaker 1>since I'm not a racist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care if you're black or </v>

95
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:40.553
<v Speaker 1>breathing if you're crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never made the point that you're </v>

96
00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:43.263
<v Speaker 1>crazy to people who run the black lives </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter are really reprehensible </v>

97
00:05:46.871 --> 00:05:49.120
<v Speaker 1>individuals and so I was objective to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

98
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't see how that makes racist with </v>
<v Speaker 1>regards to being a transport.</v>

99
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.873
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I object to the terminology because </v>

100
00:05:56.261 --> 00:05:57.094
<v Speaker 1>phobia has specific terminology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is partly why also object to the </v>

101
00:06:00.201 --> 00:06:01.520
<v Speaker 1>word luck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Islamophobia,</v>

102
00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:05.870
<v Speaker 1>because phobia is a medical term and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't just get to pull in medical terms,</v>

103
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:08.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>away from their proper context and apply</v>

104
00:06:08.571 --> 00:06:09.404
<v Speaker 1>them to those people whose political </v>
<v Speaker 1>opinions you don't happen to agree with </v>

105
00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:14.030
<v Speaker 1>misuse of language.</v>

106
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:14.863
<v Speaker 1>It's misuse of medical terminology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would also like to tell all of </v>

107
00:06:18.531 --> 00:06:19.370
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just so you know,</v>

108
00:06:19.371 --> 00:06:22.460
<v Speaker 1>that there are a number of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

109
00:06:22.461 --> 00:06:25.100
<v Speaker 1>there aren't that many transsexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>people in the world.</v>

110
00:06:25.101 --> 00:06:27.890
<v Speaker 1>There aren't that many in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So whenever you hear from any of them,</v>

111
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.920
<v Speaker 1>it's actually a reasonably substantial </v>
<v Speaker 1>portion of the overall population.</v>

112
00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:37.700
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of videos on youtube put</v>
<v Speaker 1>up like transsexual people,</v>

113
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:40.430
<v Speaker 1>including the person I talked to you in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Vancouver.</v>

114
00:06:40.431 --> 00:06:45.040
<v Speaker 1>His name is Tara Meyer who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who stayed quite vociferous with that.</v>

115
00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:47.210
<v Speaker 1>They don't agree with any of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

116
00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:48.223
<v Speaker 1>of the activist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The trend is that the so called Trans </v>

117
00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:52.363
<v Speaker 1>activist political agenda that's being </v>
<v Speaker 1>put forward as hypothetically </v>

118
00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:57.530
<v Speaker 1>representative of their approval.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

119
00:06:57.531 --> 00:07:01.430
<v Speaker 1>they're not a group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that you happened to have a,</v>

120
00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:03.990
<v Speaker 1>what would you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gender dysphoria or,</v>

121
00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:07.580
<v Speaker 1>or an indeterminate gender identity does</v>
<v Speaker 1>not make people a margin to screw.</v>

122
00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:08.443
<v Speaker 1>It certainly doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't situate you such that some </v>

123
00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:14.360
<v Speaker 1>member of your group or some so called </v>
<v Speaker 1>ally,</v>

124
00:07:14.361 --> 00:07:17.630
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can stand out and stand purport to speak</v>

125
00:07:17.631 --> 00:07:18.464
<v Speaker 1>for you on mass as if you were a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a modular scrutiny as completely </v>

126
00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:24.380
<v Speaker 1>nonsensical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

127
00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:27.400
<v Speaker 1>you can talk to a man and assuming that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he speaks for all man,</v>

128
00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.460
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't tell.</v>

129
00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.313
<v Speaker 1>Talk to a black woman and have her say </v>
<v Speaker 1>that she speaks for all black women and </v>

130
00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:36.340
<v Speaker 1>inserting the can stand up and say that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're a transsexual,</v>

131
00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.840
<v Speaker 1>you speak for all transexuals </v>
<v Speaker 1>department.</v>

132
00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:39.923
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have the idea of legitimate </v>

133
00:07:41.421 --> 00:07:45.740
<v Speaker 1>representation for people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>legitimately represented a group.</v>

134
00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:49.360
<v Speaker 1>They have to have some legitimacy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps they have to be elected.</v>

135
00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:52.640
<v Speaker 1>At least they have to pull the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are purporting to represent because</v>

136
00:07:52.641 --> 00:07:57.641
<v Speaker 1>he can just come up and say it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's inappropriate on after receiving 30</v>

137
00:07:58.221 --> 00:07:59.054
<v Speaker 1>letters from transsexual people and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>29 and the more positive and I can tell </v>

138
00:08:03.591 --> 00:08:05.720
<v Speaker 1>you why with regards to what I've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>

139
00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:09.920
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you why the first is they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not very happy with,</v>

140
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:10.993
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that they're being represented </v>

141
00:08:12.741 --> 00:08:13.574
<v Speaker 1>by these noisy activists groups because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't regain at each individual </v>

142
00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:17.943
<v Speaker 1>because these are all individuals who </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote me saying that they're not happy </v>

143
00:08:20.661 --> 00:08:22.070
<v Speaker 1>about being represented.</v>

144
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:22.903
<v Speaker 1>They're not having because that isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>how their political view of the world </v>

145
00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.200
<v Speaker 1>actually helps to lay itself out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

146
00:08:27.201 --> 00:08:29.950
<v Speaker 1>most people were turning sexual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are perfectly happened,</v>

147
00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.270
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the pronouns he and she,</v>

148
00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:34.430
<v Speaker 1>they just want to be called the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

149
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:38.810
<v Speaker 1>And so the people who are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who want the gender neutral pronouns,</v>

150
00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:40.670
<v Speaker 1>pronouns say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

151
00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:43.250
<v Speaker 1>a very small minority of a very small </v>
<v Speaker 1>minority.</v>

152
00:08:43.251 --> 00:08:44.084
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to say how many of them are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that they're somehow valid </v>

153
00:08:48.171 --> 00:08:50.260
<v Speaker 1>representatives of the whole group is </v>
<v Speaker 1>observing.</v>

154
00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:52.970
<v Speaker 1>They're also not very happy because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that,</v>

155
00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:55.890
<v Speaker 1>that that because this has become such </v>
<v Speaker 1>an issue,</v>

156
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:59.190
<v Speaker 1>there are actually likely to face more </v>
<v Speaker 1>prejudice rather than less prejudice,</v>

157
00:08:59.191 --> 00:09:01.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because generally what people want,</v>

158
00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:05.040
<v Speaker 1>regardless of whatever kind of visible </v>
<v Speaker 1>minority status they might have,</v>

159
00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:05.903
<v Speaker 1>what most people want is to live </v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively peacefully and invisibly </v>

160
00:09:09.631 --> 00:09:10.590
<v Speaker 1>among other people.</v>

161
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:15.290
<v Speaker 1>And so then whenever a political </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement comes out to exaggerate or or,</v>

162
00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.090
<v Speaker 1>or otherwise draw attention to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reporting differences,</v>

163
00:09:18.091 --> 00:09:22.890
<v Speaker 1>there's real danger in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'd like to put to rest the idea that</v>

164
00:09:22.891 --> 00:09:23.724
<v Speaker 1>somehow the transactive as to who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>accusing me of all the things that are </v>

165
00:09:27.711 --> 00:09:28.544
<v Speaker 1>accusing me of are somehow more </v>
<v Speaker 1>legitimate representatives of </v>

166
00:09:31.231 --> 00:09:36.231
<v Speaker 1>transsexual identity and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that say well being than I am.</v>

167
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:37.463
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've dealt with all sorts of people in </v>

168
00:09:40.351 --> 00:09:43.930
<v Speaker 1>my life more than more than most people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That you'll need that for sure.</v>

169
00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:45.570
<v Speaker 1>Big Span,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different sort of person.</v>

170
00:09:45.571 --> 00:09:46.404
<v Speaker 1>You can imagine that I worked hard to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make all of their lives better </v>

171
00:09:49.381 --> 00:09:51.690
<v Speaker 1>regardless of their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of their particulars,</v>

172
00:09:51.691 --> 00:09:55.150
<v Speaker 1>of their identity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so to cast me as an enemy of,</v>

173
00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:55.830
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

174
00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:58.890
<v Speaker 1>of an identifiable group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe is completely observed them.</v>

175
00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:03.240
<v Speaker 1>I think I can be confident in stating </v>
<v Speaker 1>that too because I have the good fortune</v>

176
00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:04.223
<v Speaker 1>of having about 500 hours of my public </v>
<v Speaker 1>statements to university students </v>

177
00:10:08.011 --> 00:10:08.520
<v Speaker 1>online.</v>

178
00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:11.430
<v Speaker 1>I tape everything now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything that will say to students,</v>

179
00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:12.840
<v Speaker 1>pretty much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

180
00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:13.773
<v Speaker 1>at least in the classroom if there is </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything even remotely reprehensible in </v>

181
00:10:17.431 --> 00:10:21.600
<v Speaker 1>any of that content and can be sure that</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone would have called it out and put</v>

182
00:10:21.601 --> 00:10:22.434
<v Speaker 1>it on youtube with big exclamation </v>
<v Speaker 1>points that are going to be called </v>

183
00:10:25.501 --> 00:10:28.410
<v Speaker 1>property to task for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And none of that has happened at all.</v>

184
00:10:28.411 --> 00:10:30.310
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that there </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't any of that.</v>

185
00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:31.283
<v Speaker 1>None of that exists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not saying that I'm completely </v>

186
00:10:33.961 --> 00:10:36.480
<v Speaker 1>without bias.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be a fool to say that,</v>

187
00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:37.593
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone is biased in their perceptions </v>

188
00:10:39.391 --> 00:10:40.550
<v Speaker 1>to some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>

189
00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:43.320
<v Speaker 1>that's not the point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean you're racially biased</v>

190
00:10:43.321 --> 00:10:44.154
<v Speaker 1>or that you're racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means that you have your own </v>

191
00:10:45.511 --> 00:10:46.344
<v Speaker 1>particular viewpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that comes with with </v>

192
00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:49.933
<v Speaker 1>idiosyncratic St,</v>
<v Speaker 1>St Lucy's and peculiarities of your </v>

193
00:10:52.231 --> 00:10:53.064
<v Speaker 1>character and your ethnic heritage and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your race and your culture and all of </v>

194
00:10:55.981 --> 00:10:56.700
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

195
00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:57.533
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not going to say for a moment </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I don't have my own viewpoint </v>

196
00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:05.050
<v Speaker 1>because I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm a certain things that,</v>

197
00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:09.530
<v Speaker 1>that their comments directed at me that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to target with some,</v>

198
00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:13.050
<v Speaker 1>some of these half winded epithets that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are continuing to direct it after you're</v>

199
00:11:13.051 --> 00:11:15.570
<v Speaker 1>completely without any standing </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever.</v>

200
00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.610
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

201
00:11:17.611 --> 00:11:18.444
<v Speaker 1>so let's go into the background that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill [inaudible] and why I objected to </v>

202
00:11:21.511 --> 00:11:22.344
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I looked at quite deeply into the </v>

203
00:11:24.481 --> 00:11:27.450
<v Speaker 1>legislation as it was originally </v>
<v Speaker 1>formulated in Ontario.</v>

204
00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:28.333
<v Speaker 1>And that was the legislation that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>designed to provide protection for </v>

205
00:11:31.891 --> 00:11:34.230
<v Speaker 1>people who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whose gender identities,</v>

206
00:11:34.231 --> 00:11:35.064
<v Speaker 1>let's say nonstandard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the original legislation wasn't too </v>

207
00:11:37.471 --> 00:11:38.304
<v Speaker 1>bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

208
00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.153
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It basically attempted to do perhaps </v>

209
00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:46.770
<v Speaker 1>what it should have if it was going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be reasonable and merely add,</v>

210
00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:47.663
<v Speaker 1>let's say the people who have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>nonstandard gender identities to the </v>

211
00:11:52.171 --> 00:11:53.260
<v Speaker 1>list of protected groups.</v>

212
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:54.093
<v Speaker 1>And they actually defined the known </v>
<v Speaker 1>standard gender identity fairly </v>

213
00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:57.953
<v Speaker 1>carefully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they shot the legislation out to </v>

214
00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:02.103
<v Speaker 1>activists groups and what happened was </v>
<v Speaker 1>that by the time everybody and their </v>

215
00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:05.974
<v Speaker 1>dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak and have their shot at </v>

216
00:12:07.541 --> 00:12:08.374
<v Speaker 1>modifying the original terminology was </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolute mess and it's an absolute mess </v>

217
00:12:11.381 --> 00:12:14.380
<v Speaker 1>now and I'm going to tell him why and </v>
<v Speaker 1>also why it's dangerous.</v>

218
00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:19.350
<v Speaker 1>There first thing in the policies that </v>
<v Speaker 1>surround those [inaudible].</v>

219
00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:20.883
<v Speaker 1>There's a claim that's been instantiated</v>
<v Speaker 1>law in Ontario and will soon be </v>

220
00:12:23.681 --> 00:12:24.514
<v Speaker 1>instantiated into law in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anatomy is and it's a technical and you </v>

221
00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.780
<v Speaker 1>need to pay attention to it because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the technicalities matter.</v>

222
00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:37.000
<v Speaker 1>So the claim is the biological sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gender identity,</v>

223
00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:42.930
<v Speaker 1>gender expression and sexual proclivity </v>
<v Speaker 1>very independently</v>

224
00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:47.380
<v Speaker 1>and that was a false claim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

225
00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:48.253
<v Speaker 1>that's actually what I said in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>original video and that's why people </v>

226
00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:51.873
<v Speaker 1>originally and instill accused me of </v>
<v Speaker 1>denying the existence of transsexual </v>

227
00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:56.290
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

228
00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:57.123
<v Speaker 1>There's no point in doing that because </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously transsexual people exist and </v>

229
00:13:00.281 --> 00:13:02.380
<v Speaker 1>they've existed for a very long period </v>
<v Speaker 1>of time,</v>

230
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:06.220
<v Speaker 1>but that has very little to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not biological sex,</v>

231
00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:07.240
<v Speaker 1>gender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>identity,</v>

232
00:13:07.241 --> 00:13:08.074
<v Speaker 1>gender expression and sexual proclivity </v>
<v Speaker 1>are independent and they are certainly </v>

233
00:13:11.861 --> 00:13:14.740
<v Speaker 1>not independent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not even close to a dependent.</v>

234
00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:18.460
<v Speaker 1>There are so highly correlated that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>correlation is almost perfect.</v>

235
00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:19.443
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and these things matter when you put </v>

236
00:13:20.561 --> 00:13:21.970
<v Speaker 1>them into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into,</v>

237
00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:25.390
<v Speaker 1>into a legal framework.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what's really happened is because</v>

238
00:13:25.391 --> 00:13:26.224
<v Speaker 1>the social constructionist types of lost</v>
<v Speaker 1>the intellectual battle as the </v>

239
00:13:28.811 --> 00:13:29.644
<v Speaker 1>biological evidence for the grounding of</v>
<v Speaker 1>identity has become stronger and </v>

240
00:13:32.561 --> 00:13:35.950
<v Speaker 1>stronger over the last 50 years because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've lost the scientific argument.</v>

241
00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:36.963
<v Speaker 1>They've taken the back door and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to instantiate legally it's not </v>

242
00:13:39.401 --> 00:13:44.050
<v Speaker 1>gonna work because you can make false </v>
<v Speaker 1>facts law.</v>

243
00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:46.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can hurt people by doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

244
00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:46.923
<v Speaker 1>You can cause all sorts of trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't going to work for any </v>

245
00:13:48.491 --> 00:13:51.420
<v Speaker 1>length of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's take apart the client.</v>

246
00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:53.103
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing is that biological sex </v>

247
00:13:55.181 --> 00:13:56.014
<v Speaker 1>and gender identity are actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>different and you know you can make a </v>

248
00:13:59.801 --> 00:14:00.634
<v Speaker 1>case for that in a weak way because </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there is quite a range of </v>

249
00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:07.090
<v Speaker 1>personality expression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

250
00:14:07.091 --> 00:14:12.091
<v Speaker 1>and interests among people who have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same biological sex,</v>

251
00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:15.160
<v Speaker 1>so there are masculine limit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

252
00:14:15.161 --> 00:14:17.470
<v Speaker 1>and there are feminine now and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite an overlap,</v>

253
00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:20.500
<v Speaker 1>although you can distinguish the </v>
<v Speaker 1>janitors quite,</v>

254
00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:21.783
<v Speaker 1>quite accurately using nothing but </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality information and interest so </v>

255
00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:28.240
<v Speaker 1>you can separate them even at the level </v>
<v Speaker 1>where there is some similarity,</v>

256
00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:31.000
<v Speaker 1>but so you can make a weakened case for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

257
00:14:31.001 --> 00:14:31.834
<v Speaker 1>but it's difficult to make a strong case</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason for that is that </v>

258
00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:38.170
<v Speaker 1>virtually every person who was </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological sex is male,</v>

259
00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:43.020
<v Speaker 1>expresses themselves in mail or has an </v>
<v Speaker 1>identity that's now.</v>

260
00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:47.320
<v Speaker 1>It's only about one in 300 people for </v>
<v Speaker 1>whom that I get the difference.</v>

261
00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:49.160
<v Speaker 1>Now you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's because the,</v>

262
00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:50.290
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

263
00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:53.600
<v Speaker 1>the degree gender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you say?</v>

264
00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:57.710
<v Speaker 1>Amorphousness has been suppressed by </v>
<v Speaker 1>sociological phenomenon.</v>

265
00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:00.440
<v Speaker 1>I suppose that's true to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't matter.</v>

266
00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:01.333
<v Speaker 1>It's still going to being a very tiny </v>
<v Speaker 1>minority and he's narrowed to exceed </v>

267
00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:05.090
<v Speaker 1>more than one percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

268
00:15:05.091 --> 00:15:05.924
<v Speaker 1>What that means is that 99 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people at the same gender identity as </v>

269
00:15:10.341 --> 00:15:13.370
<v Speaker 1>biological sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so how has that independent?</v>

270
00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:16.820
<v Speaker 1>It's the very opposite of independent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's wrong.</v>

271
00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:17.713
<v Speaker 1>It's a simple as that and then now that </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean there aren't people who </v>

272
00:15:20.721 --> 00:15:21.554
<v Speaker 1>don't wear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those two identities don't match and </v>

273
00:15:23.511 --> 00:15:25.370
<v Speaker 1>those are the transsexual people </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>

274
00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:27.740
<v Speaker 1>but two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to extract from that,</v>

275
00:15:27.741 --> 00:15:28.574
<v Speaker 1>the statement that those very </v>
<v Speaker 1>independently is a intellectual sleight </v>

276
00:15:31.041 --> 00:15:34.880
<v Speaker 1>of hand and it's really been pushed </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward by people who are radical social</v>

277
00:15:34.881 --> 00:15:35.714
<v Speaker 1>constructionists who believe that every </v>
<v Speaker 1>single aspect of human identity is </v>

278
00:15:38.721 --> 00:15:42.500
<v Speaker 1>determined by culture and that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>patently false and not only that,</v>

279
00:15:42.501 --> 00:15:46.910
<v Speaker 1>it's dangerous politically because one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the ideas that characterized the most</v>

280
00:15:46.911 --> 00:15:47.744
<v Speaker 1>reprehensible movements of the 20th </v>
<v Speaker 1>century was the human beings can be </v>

281
00:15:50.091 --> 00:15:50.924
<v Speaker 1>molded in any manner possible by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>state that we didn't have any intrinsic </v>

282
00:15:54.201 --> 00:15:55.034
<v Speaker 1>identity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that any sort and that were only </v>

283
00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:57.770
<v Speaker 1>creatures of coalition.</v>

284
00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:01.130
<v Speaker 1>And that's not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a very distinct human identity,</v>

285
00:16:01.131 --> 00:16:03.910
<v Speaker 1>and I'll talk a little bit more about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that as this progresses.</v>

286
00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:08.300
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so gender identity and biological sex do</v>

287
00:16:08.301 --> 00:16:09.134
<v Speaker 1>not very independent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the first thing that clamp as </v>

288
00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:13.690
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's moved to gender expression.</v>

289
00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:14.953
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can address in any manner in what </v>

290
00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:20.330
<v Speaker 1>you can express yourself in a feminine </v>
<v Speaker 1>manner,</v>

291
00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:21.193
<v Speaker 1>culturally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a male or you can express </v>

292
00:16:22.671 --> 00:16:25.100
<v Speaker 1>yourself in the mascot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now culturally speaking,</v>

293
00:16:25.101 --> 00:16:25.934
<v Speaker 1>if you're female,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the truth of the matter is that the </v>

294
00:16:27.801 --> 00:16:32.240
<v Speaker 1>vast majority of people whose biological</v>
<v Speaker 1>sex is male and whose gender identity is</v>

295
00:16:32.241 --> 00:16:33.074
<v Speaker 1>male,</v>
<v Speaker 1>presented themselves in their fashion </v>

296
00:16:34.761 --> 00:16:38.150
<v Speaker 1>choices as male and the same can be said</v>
<v Speaker 1>about females.</v>

297
00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:42.110
<v Speaker 1>So the notion that there's independence </v>
<v Speaker 1>there is also interact.</v>

298
00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:44.530
<v Speaker 1>They can vary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't vary independently.</v>

299
00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:47.150
<v Speaker 1>And finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with regards to sexual proclivity,</v>

300
00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:50.230
<v Speaker 1>the vast majority of people who are male</v>
<v Speaker 1>who a,</v>

301
00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:53.630
<v Speaker 1>who identify as a male who presented </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves as male,</v>

302
00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:55.220
<v Speaker 1>are also heterosexual.</v>

303
00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:58.100
<v Speaker 1>And that doesn't mean that there are new</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are homosexual.</v>

304
00:16:58.101 --> 00:17:00.560
<v Speaker 1>The percentage varies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it looks like it's somewhere between</v>

305
00:17:00.561 --> 00:17:01.394
<v Speaker 1>two and five percent or maybe between </v>
<v Speaker 1>one and five percent depending on the </v>

306
00:17:04.071 --> 00:17:04.904
<v Speaker 1>statistics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that means that at least 95 percent </v>

307
00:17:07.551 --> 00:17:08.384
<v Speaker 1>of people who are male who identify as </v>
<v Speaker 1>male and present and present themselves </v>

308
00:17:12.861 --> 00:17:13.694
<v Speaker 1>as male are also heterosexual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so those four levels of analysis do not </v>

309
00:17:18.381 --> 00:17:23.381
<v Speaker 1>very independently and that's that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the law is incorrect,</v>

310
00:17:23.511 --> 00:17:24.344
<v Speaker 1>it's badly formulated and it's poorly </v>
<v Speaker 1>put forward and that's what I was </v>

311
00:17:26.781 --> 00:17:27.614
<v Speaker 1>objecting to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now is worse than that as far as I can </v>

312
00:17:30.201 --> 00:17:32.410
<v Speaker 1>tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's social construction is dale</v>

313
00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:36.620
<v Speaker 1>and the social infrastructure element is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the insistence that all those things are</v>

314
00:17:36.621 --> 00:17:39.920
<v Speaker 1>culturally are culturally constructed </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're not.</v>

315
00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:42.410
<v Speaker 1>So let's do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's review that a little bit.</v>

316
00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:44.690
<v Speaker 1>It's like elementary biology I suppose.</v>

317
00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:48.150
<v Speaker 1>What's different between men and women?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

318
00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:50.123
<v Speaker 1>well there's a variety of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know the classic human embryo </v>

319
00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:57.990
<v Speaker 1>logical for is female xx or x,</v>
<v Speaker 1>y,</v>

320
00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:02.310
<v Speaker 1>and the males are a masculinized in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Utero by testosterone.</v>

321
00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:03.383
<v Speaker 1>So that's the first difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And testosterone exposure in Utero has </v>

322
00:18:06.391 --> 00:18:10.260
<v Speaker 1>quite profound effects on later on all </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of phenomena.</v>

323
00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:13.230
<v Speaker 1>Psychological and physical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so for example,</v>

324
00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:16.980
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that higher levels of </v>
<v Speaker 1>testosterone in Utero seem to predict is</v>

325
00:18:16.981 --> 00:18:20.480
<v Speaker 1>less interest in people that more </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest in face and so,</v>

326
00:18:20.481 --> 00:18:24.390
<v Speaker 1>and that's been well documented research</v>
<v Speaker 1>teams in the UK in particular,</v>

327
00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:26.500
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in any case,</v>

328
00:18:26.501 --> 00:18:30.090
<v Speaker 1>so this Feminine Female Morpho the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Standard Morphology is female,</v>

329
00:18:30.091 --> 00:18:34.020
<v Speaker 1>but it's translated into male,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a male morphology by testosterone.</v>

330
00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:35.723
<v Speaker 1>And so then what do you get for standard</v>
<v Speaker 1>morphological transformations while </v>

331
00:18:38.821 --> 00:18:43.300
<v Speaker 1>there's the evident genetic ones </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking technically a,</v>

332
00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:44.153
<v Speaker 1>obviously male and female genitalia </v>
<v Speaker 1>differ substantially as you all know </v>

333
00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:50.070
<v Speaker 1>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are,</v>

334
00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:53.100
<v Speaker 1>there is some variation in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it's very rare.</v>

335
00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:54.323
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there are also other </v>

336
00:18:56.131 --> 00:18:59.430
<v Speaker 1>differences that kick forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when puberty hits and some of</v>

337
00:18:59.431 --> 00:19:01.610
<v Speaker 1>those are physiological and some of them</v>
<v Speaker 1>are resectable.</v>

338
00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:04.410
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that you see have </v>
<v Speaker 1>you for example,</v>

339
00:19:04.411 --> 00:19:05.244
<v Speaker 1>is that there aren't very many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there aren't very large personality </v>

340
00:19:08.491 --> 00:19:09.324
<v Speaker 1>differences between boys and girls </v>
<v Speaker 1>before purely doing with regards to </v>

341
00:19:12.151 --> 00:19:12.984
<v Speaker 1>negative emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's trading neuroticism for those </v>

342
00:19:15.241 --> 00:19:17.730
<v Speaker 1>of you who are interested in big five </v>
<v Speaker 1>trait terminology.</v>

343
00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.073
<v Speaker 1>And so people who were high on </v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism are more sensitive to </v>

344
00:19:21.091 --> 00:19:21.924
<v Speaker 1>anxiety and emotional pain and women are</v>
<v Speaker 1>more sensitive than men to anxiety and </v>

345
00:19:26.431 --> 00:19:30.000
<v Speaker 1>emotional pain on average and the effect</v>
<v Speaker 1>is massive.</v>

346
00:19:30.001 --> 00:19:32.430
<v Speaker 1>It's about a third to half a standard </v>
<v Speaker 1>deviation,</v>

347
00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:33.443
<v Speaker 1>but it's massive enough so that if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the end of the distributions </v>

348
00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:40.830
<v Speaker 1>were the extreme and people are almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the people who have extreme problems</v>

349
00:19:40.831 --> 00:19:42.330
<v Speaker 1>with anxiety and emotional pain.</v>

350
00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:43.163
<v Speaker 1>Our window,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's running about four to one in terms </v>

351
00:19:44.791 --> 00:19:45.624
<v Speaker 1>of depression and anxiety disorder </v>
<v Speaker 1>diagnosis worldwide and there's no </v>

352
00:19:49.291 --> 00:19:52.380
<v Speaker 1>evidence that that's cultural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now on the other end of the spectrum,</v>

353
00:19:52.381 --> 00:19:55.070
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are male pathologies as well,</v>

354
00:19:55.071 --> 00:19:55.904
<v Speaker 1>so males are much more likely to </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifest every social personality </v>

355
00:19:58.531 --> 00:19:59.364
<v Speaker 1>disordered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're much more likely to be </v>

356
00:20:00.421 --> 00:20:01.254
<v Speaker 1>characterized by alcoholism and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>also more much more likely to manifest </v>

357
00:20:04.741 --> 00:20:07.950
<v Speaker 1>and attention deficit disorder and </v>
<v Speaker 1>various learning disabilities.</v>

358
00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:12.150
<v Speaker 1>And so that also seems to be biologic </v>
<v Speaker 1>dedicated to a large degree.</v>

359
00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:15.780
<v Speaker 1>So and interestingly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those differences,</v>

360
00:20:15.781 --> 00:20:20.190
<v Speaker 1>the personality differences between men </v>
<v Speaker 1>and women with regards to trade negative</v>

361
00:20:20.191 --> 00:20:23.310
<v Speaker 1>emotion emerge up puberty while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while.</v>

362
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:24.690
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's think about it for a minute.</v>

363
00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:26.340
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are speculations,</v>

364
00:20:26.341 --> 00:20:27.174
<v Speaker 1>but you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can think about that until you tell </v>

365
00:20:28.651 --> 00:20:29.490
<v Speaker 1>me what you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

366
00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.350
<v Speaker 1>they're reasonably grounded </v>
<v Speaker 1>speculations,</v>

367
00:20:31.351 --> 00:20:34.290
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not certainly going to state them as</v>

368
00:20:34.291 --> 00:20:36.290
<v Speaker 1>fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I would say that the,</v>

369
00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:39.900
<v Speaker 1>the idea that these differences in </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality between men and women exist,</v>

370
00:20:39.901 --> 00:20:40.734
<v Speaker 1>that's fast.</v>

371
00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:42.653
<v Speaker 1>How powerful those different those </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences are and precisely what they </v>

372
00:20:46.171 --> 00:20:49.000
<v Speaker 1>consist of is still subject to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>investigation,</v>

373
00:20:49.001 --> 00:20:51.040
<v Speaker 1>but it's extraordinarily well </v>
<v Speaker 1>documented.</v>

374
00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:55.170
<v Speaker 1>So what happens to men and men at </v>
<v Speaker 1>puberty,</v>

375
00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:58.810
<v Speaker 1>while the men get bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get stronger,</v>

376
00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:03.070
<v Speaker 1>especially in their upper bodies and </v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings are quite impressive.</v>

377
00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:05.530
<v Speaker 1>Were prey animals as well as we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>predators,</v>

378
00:21:05.531 --> 00:21:06.364
<v Speaker 1>as well as what are the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the ways that we defend </v>

379
00:21:08.901 --> 00:21:11.260
<v Speaker 1>ourselves aggressively is using the </v>
<v Speaker 1>upper body strength.</v>

380
00:21:11.261 --> 00:21:15.130
<v Speaker 1>So we punch like Kangaroos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's other evidence to do that.</v>

381
00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:16.770
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we punched.</v>

382
00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:19.960
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is that men are </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite a bit more dangerous than women in</v>

383
00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:23.830
<v Speaker 1>say hand to hand combat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's an American actual actually a</v>

384
00:21:23.831 --> 00:21:25.420
<v Speaker 1>real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see one of those,</v>

385
00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:30.480
<v Speaker 1>you see that manifest itself in part in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a strange statistic because it will come</v>

386
00:21:30.791 --> 00:21:31.624
<v Speaker 1>as news to most of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why is it their husbands more often </v>

387
00:21:33.881 --> 00:21:36.580
<v Speaker 1>than husband see if their wives quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite a lot actually,</v>

388
00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:37.893
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>

389
00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:38.863
<v Speaker 1>It's a misleading statistic to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree because women lack upper body </v>

390
00:21:41.471 --> 00:21:42.304
<v Speaker 1>strength.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can hit their husbands and they're </v>

391
00:21:43.001 --> 00:21:43.834
<v Speaker 1>not really going to hurt them that much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are men who are abused and </v>

392
00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:49.450
<v Speaker 1>neglected that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the problems with having much</v>

393
00:21:49.451 --> 00:21:50.284
<v Speaker 1>harder at upper body strength is that if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hit some your life Bible to hurt </v>

394
00:21:53.201 --> 00:21:54.034
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so a male aggression in the context </v>

395
00:21:56.741 --> 00:21:57.574
<v Speaker 1>of a dyadic relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>physical aggression as much more likely </v>

396
00:21:59.501 --> 00:22:00.334
<v Speaker 1>to be dangerous or lethal than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>female version of the same sort as part </v>

397
00:22:03.551 --> 00:22:04.384
<v Speaker 1>of the reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that women are more likely to </v>

398
00:22:05.621 --> 00:22:06.454
<v Speaker 1>hit their husbands or wives more likely </v>
<v Speaker 1>to interest us that the reverse is </v>

399
00:22:08.861 --> 00:22:09.694
<v Speaker 1>because both have wives and the husbands</v>
<v Speaker 1>know perfectly well that the wife is </v>

400
00:22:12.401 --> 00:22:13.234
<v Speaker 1>going to hurt as much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there isn't as much inhibition </v>

401
00:22:15.011 --> 00:22:15.880
<v Speaker 1>against the aggression.</v>

402
00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:18.400
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now what is it?</v>

403
00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:21.160
<v Speaker 1>What is it mean for women that men are </v>
<v Speaker 1>stronger than them?</v>

404
00:22:21.161 --> 00:22:25.990
<v Speaker 1>Starting at puberty means that women are</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a disadvantage in physical combat and</v>

405
00:22:25.991 --> 00:22:26.824
<v Speaker 1>that's part of the reason I think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>their nervous systems make them more </v>

406
00:22:28.661 --> 00:22:29.494
<v Speaker 1>nervous or anxious and more susceptible </v>
<v Speaker 1>to emotional pain is because the world </v>

407
00:22:33.071 --> 00:22:36.460
<v Speaker 1>is actually more dangerous for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the world is also more dangerous for</v>

408
00:22:36.461 --> 00:22:38.830
<v Speaker 1>women's sexually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that self evident,</v>

409
00:22:38.831 --> 00:22:39.664
<v Speaker 1>I really think I have to explain that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope no one is foolish enough to try </v>

410
00:22:43.511 --> 00:22:44.344
<v Speaker 1>to disagree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Definitely the reason that sex is more </v>

411
00:22:46.751 --> 00:22:50.890
<v Speaker 1>dangerous for women than for men </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously because women can get pregnant</v>

412
00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:53.680
<v Speaker 1>and that changes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That changes their life completely.</v>

413
00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:56.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they may choose to have an abortion,</v>

414
00:22:56.021 --> 00:23:00.040
<v Speaker 1>but that in itself is no trivial matter </v>
<v Speaker 1>and as soon as you have a child and that</v>

415
00:23:00.041 --> 00:23:00.874
<v Speaker 1>child is dependent on you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then your whole life is changed and in </v>

416
00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:08.920
<v Speaker 1>in more traditional societies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you had a sexual adventure outside of</v>

417
00:23:08.921 --> 00:23:12.820
<v Speaker 1>the standard traditional structures and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you ended up pregnant,</v>

418
00:23:12.821 --> 00:23:13.654
<v Speaker 1>now you are in serious trouble and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>for women to be more anxious and more </v>

419
00:23:17.531 --> 00:23:18.364
<v Speaker 1>susceptible to the emotional pain </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of their increased sexual </v>

420
00:23:20.411 --> 00:23:22.180
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability is perfectly reasonable.</v>

421
00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:23.883
<v Speaker 1>Then the final reason I think that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>women are more susceptible to anxiety </v>

422
00:23:28.421 --> 00:23:31.540
<v Speaker 1>and emotional pain than men is because.</v>

423
00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:37.720
<v Speaker 1>Let me see now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lost my train of thought for that.</v>

424
00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:39.700
<v Speaker 1>I'll have to come back to that for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>

425
00:23:39.910 --> 00:23:40.910
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

426
00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:44.623
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not obvious to me that women's </v>

427
00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:46.603
<v Speaker 1>nervous systems are actually actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>serve to function in the best interest </v>

428
00:23:50.781 --> 00:23:51.614
<v Speaker 1>of women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that they actually serve to </v>

429
00:23:54.171 --> 00:23:58.340
<v Speaker 1>function in the best interests of women </v>
<v Speaker 1>and infants because you think,</v>

430
00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:01.790
<v Speaker 1>do you think about our evolutionary past</v>
<v Speaker 1>and for that matter are present?</v>

431
00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:02.993
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're quite a different creature when </v>

432
00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:07.490
<v Speaker 1>you're single person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>male or female,</v>

433
00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:09.920
<v Speaker 1>then you are when you're a female as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>incident,</v>

434
00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:15.050
<v Speaker 1>especially the intent that's under the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bolt hole on soul because human entrance</v>

435
00:24:15.051 --> 00:24:15.884
<v Speaker 1>are unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know they're born in some sense of way </v>

436
00:24:19.711 --> 00:24:20.544
<v Speaker 1>before they shouldn't be in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's part of an evolutionary problem </v>

437
00:24:22.821 --> 00:24:25.220
<v Speaker 1>too because our hands are so fake that </v>
<v Speaker 1>babies are.</v>

438
00:24:25.221 --> 00:24:26.054
<v Speaker 1>Babies have to be born very young </v>
<v Speaker 1>compared to other mammals that are our </v>

439
00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:30.200
<v Speaker 1>size.</v>

440
00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:33.320
<v Speaker 1>Roughly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The gestation period shouldn't be longer</v>

441
00:24:33.321 --> 00:24:36.170
<v Speaker 1>for human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because our heads are so big,</v>

442
00:24:36.171 --> 00:24:37.004
<v Speaker 1>the babies have to come under early and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes them route relatively </v>

443
00:24:38.931 --> 00:24:40.800
<v Speaker 1>underdeveloped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

444
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.940
<v Speaker 1>and so they need a tremendous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>care.</v>

445
00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:43.813
<v Speaker 1>They're very fragile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it seems to be quite likely that </v>

446
00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:47.233
<v Speaker 1>women's nervous systems are optimized so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're more threat sensitive and </v>

447
00:24:50.261 --> 00:24:51.094
<v Speaker 1>more sensitive to emotional pain because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to be more responsive to </v>

448
00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:54.253
<v Speaker 1>infants and they have to take care of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in your most fragile state </v>

449
00:24:57.291 --> 00:24:58.770
<v Speaker 1>and happen to be in the first nine </v>
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>

450
00:24:58.771 --> 00:24:59.604
<v Speaker 1>And I think that tilts women's nervous </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems hard in the direction of what </v>

451
00:25:04.041 --> 00:25:06.590
<v Speaker 1>men might regard as excessive negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotionality,</v>

452
00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:07.453
<v Speaker 1>but you have to be sensitive to threat </v>
<v Speaker 1>and danger if you're going to have an </v>

453
00:25:09.351 --> 00:25:11.360
<v Speaker 1>infant because they're very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very fragile.</v>

454
00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:12.703
<v Speaker 1>So I think those are the reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's lots of other personality </v>

455
00:25:15.771 --> 00:25:17.210
<v Speaker 1>differences between men and women.</v>

456
00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:18.213
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can give you a list of them and these </v>

457
00:25:19.191 --> 00:25:21.650
<v Speaker 1>are well documented it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you might as well know about them.</v>

458
00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:23.063
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not a lot of difference in men </v>

459
00:25:24.951 --> 00:25:28.310
<v Speaker 1>and women in terms of extroversion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Extroversion as a whole.</v>

460
00:25:28.311 --> 00:25:29.144
<v Speaker 1>Extroversion is roughly the dimension </v>
<v Speaker 1>that bring in the dimension of </v>

461
00:25:31.641 --> 00:25:34.040
<v Speaker 1>personality that's associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive emotion.</v>

462
00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:37.700
<v Speaker 1>And extroverted people are gregarious </v>
<v Speaker 1>and enthusiastic and assertive.</v>

463
00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:39.710
<v Speaker 1>They like to party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They like to have a good time.</v>

464
00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:44.040
<v Speaker 1>The social environment is their </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment and extroversion breaks down</v>

465
00:25:44.041 --> 00:25:47.210
<v Speaker 1>into enthusiasm and assertiveness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>women are more enthusiasm,</v>

466
00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:50.390
<v Speaker 1>which means that not only do they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>more negative emotion than men,</v>

467
00:25:50.391 --> 00:25:53.330
<v Speaker 1>they also have more positive emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

468
00:25:53.650 --> 00:25:54.483
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's the positive emotion </v>

469
00:25:55.971 --> 00:25:56.804
<v Speaker 1>dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The negative emotion dimension is </v>

470
00:25:58.761 --> 00:25:59.960
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>

471
00:25:59.961 --> 00:26:02.180
<v Speaker 1>somewhat pleasantly named,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>

472
00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:05.060
<v Speaker 1>but it basically index is anxiety and </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional pain,</v>

473
00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:06.410
<v Speaker 1>frustration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disappointment,</v>

474
00:26:06.411 --> 00:26:08.590
<v Speaker 1>grief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of thing.</v>

475
00:26:08.610 --> 00:26:09.443
<v Speaker 1>All logo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same dimension that breaks into </v>

476
00:26:11.721 --> 00:26:14.180
<v Speaker 1>volatility and volatility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>volatility.</v>

477
00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:15.033
<v Speaker 1>People are rather irritable and and </v>
<v Speaker 1>withdrawal and withdrawal are less </v>

478
00:26:18.771 --> 00:26:22.470
<v Speaker 1>likely to do things that are threatened </v>
<v Speaker 1>and women are higher by about a third of</v>

479
00:26:22.471 --> 00:26:25.410
<v Speaker 1>the standard deviation in both </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeable.</v>

480
00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:26.313
<v Speaker 1>This is the dimension that men and women</v>
<v Speaker 1>differ on the most and agreeable people </v>

481
00:26:31.161 --> 00:26:31.994
<v Speaker 1>and this is I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most fundamental dimension of </v>

482
00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:37.520
<v Speaker 1>matching it at that characterizes human </v>
<v Speaker 1>being so agreeable.</v>

483
00:26:37.521 --> 00:26:41.330
<v Speaker 1>People are compassionate and polite and </v>
<v Speaker 1>warm and kind and giving,</v>

484
00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:43.480
<v Speaker 1>but they're easy to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's easy to take of</v>

485
00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:45.283
<v Speaker 3>standing up for themselves and actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look at one of the things that </v>

486
00:26:47.611 --> 00:26:51.060
<v Speaker 3>predicts wage differential across time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>male or female,</v>

487
00:26:51.061 --> 00:26:51.894
<v Speaker 3>there's more agreeable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People get paid less and the reason for </v>

488
00:26:54.031 --> 00:26:56.620
<v Speaker 3>that is that often salary negotiation </v>
<v Speaker 3>negotiations,</v>

489
00:26:56.621 --> 00:26:59.430
<v Speaker 3>that zero sum and if and if you're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>aggressive,</v>

490
00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:00.293
<v Speaker 3>you don't get paid because people aren't</v>
<v Speaker 3>just going to give you money because </v>

491
00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:04.410
<v Speaker 3>they're going to be nice to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is not how it works.</v>

492
00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:05.483
<v Speaker 3>You generally have to fight for status </v>
<v Speaker 3>and position and movement forward </v>

493
00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:11.910
<v Speaker 3>careers and in order to that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd have to take a relatively,</v>

494
00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:13.553
<v Speaker 3>I would say self centered attitude </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they all sent in some sense the </v>

495
00:27:16.671 --> 00:27:18.930
<v Speaker 3>opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The opposite of being agreeable is to be</v>

496
00:27:18.931 --> 00:27:22.830
<v Speaker 3>self centered and I'm also not saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>that in a particularly negative way.</v>

497
00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:24.043
<v Speaker 3>There's advantages to being self </v>
<v Speaker 3>centered and to fight for your own </v>

498
00:27:25.951 --> 00:27:29.790
<v Speaker 3>territory and so and men are more likely</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do that and you might say,</v>

499
00:27:29.791 --> 00:27:30.624
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's your evidence that those </v>

500
00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:33.053
<v Speaker 3>differences in personality aren't </v>
<v Speaker 3>culturally constructed and the evidence </v>

501
00:27:35.701 --> 00:27:36.000
<v Speaker 3>for that?</v>

502
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.520
<v Speaker 3>It's quite clear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can go online,</v>

503
00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:38.363
<v Speaker 3>you look up the Scandinavian studies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's go online and look up gender </v>

504
00:27:41.041 --> 00:27:43.200
<v Speaker 3>differences in personality </v>
<v Speaker 3>cross-culturally.</v>

505
00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:46.410
<v Speaker 3>You'll find the relevant studies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've been done with tens of thousands</v>

506
00:27:46.411 --> 00:27:50.370
<v Speaker 3>of people and what they showed quite </v>
<v Speaker 3>clearly is that in those societies where</v>

507
00:27:50.371 --> 00:27:54.450
<v Speaker 3>the most is being done to move,</v>
<v Speaker 3>move to social world,</v>

508
00:27:54.570 --> 00:27:55.403
<v Speaker 3>into a position of radically quality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so that would roughly be the </v>

509
00:27:58.110 --> 00:27:58.943
<v Speaker 3>Scandinavian countries because they've </v>
<v Speaker 3>done more than that more than any other </v>

510
00:28:02.011 --> 00:28:02.844
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The personality differences between men </v>

511
00:28:04.291 --> 00:28:08.280
<v Speaker 3>and women maximize,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't minimize,</v>

512
00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:09.203
<v Speaker 3>they maximize.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'll say that again at in the </v>

513
00:28:11.641 --> 00:28:12.474
<v Speaker 3>countries where the most has been done </v>
<v Speaker 3>to equalize the playing field between </v>

514
00:28:17.461 --> 00:28:18.294
<v Speaker 3>men and women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Men and women get more different rather </v>

515
00:28:20.911 --> 00:28:21.744
<v Speaker 3>than more of the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for all your social constructionists </v>

516
00:28:24.151 --> 00:28:24.984
<v Speaker 3>out there in the audience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's probably not that many of </v>

517
00:28:26.311 --> 00:28:27.144
<v Speaker 3>you because you wouldn't come in here </v>
<v Speaker 3>and be talked to or social </v>

518
00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:30.960
<v Speaker 3>constructionist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're actually wrong.</v>

519
00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:34.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

520
00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:35.533
<v Speaker 3>and the thing is,</v>

521
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:40.750
<v Speaker 2>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't</v>

522
00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:46.750
<v Speaker 3>be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

523
00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:47.963
<v Speaker 3>One of the things you might be </v>
<v Speaker 3>interested in is that it's all the same </v>

524
00:28:50.611 --> 00:28:51.444
<v Speaker 3>to me in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when I was looking into this to </v>

525
00:28:53.401 --> 00:28:56.400
<v Speaker 3>begin with in this group started </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably 25 years ago,</v>

526
00:28:56.401 --> 00:28:59.700
<v Speaker 3>looking at differences in personality </v>
<v Speaker 3>between men and women,</v>

527
00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:00.933
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't go at all whether they were </v>

528
00:29:02.311 --> 00:29:05.750
<v Speaker 3>fundamentally biological,</v>
<v Speaker 3>biological are fundamentally associate,</v>

529
00:29:05.751 --> 00:29:09.270
<v Speaker 3>large boiler or mixed produced the </v>
<v Speaker 3>differences,</v>

530
00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:10.143
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one knew and the most logical </v>

531
00:29:11.911 --> 00:29:12.744
<v Speaker 3>hypothesis really the ipod was that as </v>
<v Speaker 3>unique as this society that men and </v>

532
00:29:16.531 --> 00:29:19.620
<v Speaker 3>women would become more of the same,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that is not what happened,</v>

533
00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:20.513
<v Speaker 3>and so we've actually looked the social </v>
<v Speaker 3>constructionist hypothesis with regards </v>

534
00:29:23.041 --> 00:29:26.190
<v Speaker 3>to gender differences in insects and </v>
<v Speaker 3>personality.</v>

535
00:29:26.191 --> 00:29:27.024
<v Speaker 3>We'll put that to the test and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>very intense way and the social </v>

536
00:29:29.251 --> 00:29:30.084
<v Speaker 3>constructionist viewpoint fail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's very strange because no one </v>

537
00:29:33.421 --> 00:29:34.630
<v Speaker 3>really believed that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

538
00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:35.493
<v Speaker 3>If you make this make society one of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>same in men and women get more </v>

539
00:29:37.621 --> 00:29:38.490
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>

540
00:29:38.491 --> 00:29:40.170
<v Speaker 3>what's up with that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

541
00:29:40.171 --> 00:29:44.020
<v Speaker 3>the answer seems to is that there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamentally two sources of variability</v>

542
00:29:44.021 --> 00:29:45.190
<v Speaker 3>in personality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

543
00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:46.203
<v Speaker 3>There's perhaps more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can categorize them as roughly </v>

544
00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:51.850
<v Speaker 3>genetic and roughly sociological.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

545
00:29:51.851 --> 00:29:52.684
<v Speaker 3>if you take out all the sociological </v>
<v Speaker 3>differences between the landscape in </v>

546
00:29:56.471 --> 00:29:57.304
<v Speaker 3>which men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>women are raped and all you have left </v>

547
00:29:58.811 --> 00:29:59.644
<v Speaker 3>are the biological and genetic </v>
<v Speaker 3>differences so they maximize or that's </v>

548
00:30:02.771 --> 00:30:05.080
<v Speaker 3>exactly what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This actually matters.</v>

549
00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:06.393
<v Speaker 3>It really matters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is why the demands for equity </v>

550
00:30:08.681 --> 00:30:09.640
<v Speaker 3>or so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

551
00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:12.190
<v Speaker 3>there's 15 reasons why demands for </v>
<v Speaker 3>equity.</v>

552
00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:15.260
<v Speaker 3>This is between men and women should not</v>
<v Speaker 3>be overlooked.</v>

553
00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:16.143
<v Speaker 3>Partly because it's wrong to overlook </v>
<v Speaker 3>the junior with differences between men </v>

554
00:30:19.901 --> 00:30:21.480
<v Speaker 3>and women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not good for the man.</v>

555
00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:22.363
<v Speaker 3>It's not good for the women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So one of the things you see in </v>

556
00:30:24.551 --> 00:30:25.870
<v Speaker 3>Scandinavia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

557
00:30:25.871 --> 00:30:26.704
<v Speaker 3>is there's an overwhelming preponderance</v>
<v Speaker 3>of female nurses and there's an </v>

558
00:30:29.561 --> 00:30:34.561
<v Speaker 3>overwhelming preponderance of male </v>
<v Speaker 3>engineers and actually the data on,</v>

559
00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:36.250
<v Speaker 3>on personality differences.</v>

560
00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:37.900
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

561
00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:38.913
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's the standard traits which I'll </v>

562
00:30:40.061 --> 00:30:41.560
<v Speaker 3>continue to go through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

563
00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:42.453
<v Speaker 3>I can do that quite quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no much difference in trait </v>

564
00:30:44.951 --> 00:30:48.580
<v Speaker 3>conscientiousness between men and women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you break it down into the aspects,</v>

565
00:30:48.581 --> 00:30:49.414
<v Speaker 3>women are a bit more orderly than men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's no difference in </v>

566
00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:56.410
<v Speaker 3>industriousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then with regards to openness,</v>

567
00:30:56.411 --> 00:30:58.330
<v Speaker 3>which is the intellect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>intellect,</v>

568
00:30:58.331 --> 00:31:00.250
<v Speaker 3>creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dimension overall,</v>

569
00:31:00.251 --> 00:31:01.720
<v Speaker 3>there's no difference between men and </v>
<v Speaker 3>women,</v>

570
00:31:01.721 --> 00:31:02.554
<v Speaker 3>but if you break it up into the aspects,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the differences are actually quite </v>

571
00:31:04.931 --> 00:31:05.764
<v Speaker 3>pronounced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what you have is the openness to </v>

572
00:31:08.021 --> 00:31:08.854
<v Speaker 3>experience is the technical trade and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>roughly breaks down into something </v>

573
00:31:11.831 --> 00:31:12.664
<v Speaker 3>that's sort of like create creativity </v>
<v Speaker 3>and aesthetic interests versus the </v>

574
00:31:15.391 --> 00:31:16.224
<v Speaker 3>interest in ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what you see is that women are a </v>

575
00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:22.510
<v Speaker 3>third of the standard deviation higher </v>
<v Speaker 3>than men in terms of,</v>

576
00:31:22.650 --> 00:31:26.410
<v Speaker 3>of creativity and aesthetic aesthetic </v>
<v Speaker 3>proclivity,</v>

577
00:31:26.411 --> 00:31:27.244
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and men or month or the standard </v>

578
00:31:28.541 --> 00:31:31.750
<v Speaker 3>deviation higher than women in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 3>interest in ideas.</v>

579
00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:34.570
<v Speaker 3>And it's not a trivial difference and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>makes a difference.</v>

580
00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:35.823
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the biggest difference between men </v>

581
00:31:37.001 --> 00:31:37.834
<v Speaker 3>and women as it turns out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is almost one standard </v>

582
00:31:40.301 --> 00:31:42.140
<v Speaker 3>deviation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a walloping difference.</v>

583
00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:46.690
<v Speaker 3>You never see that in social sciences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And massive difference is um,</v>

584
00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:50.560
<v Speaker 3>difference between difference in </v>
<v Speaker 3>interest and the masculine interests.</v>

585
00:31:50.561 --> 00:31:53.140
<v Speaker 3>Roughly speaking is in things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then female interest,</v>

586
00:31:53.141 --> 00:31:53.974
<v Speaker 3>roughly speaking is in people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what underlies the </v>

587
00:31:56.381 --> 00:31:57.830
<v Speaker 3>differences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say in,</v>

588
00:31:57.980 --> 00:31:58.813
<v Speaker 3>in career choice preference between </v>
<v Speaker 3>things like nursing and psychology and </v>

589
00:32:01.721 --> 00:32:05.980
<v Speaker 3>social work and that sort of thing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>engineering and uh,</v>

590
00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:07.083
<v Speaker 3>because engineering is perhaps the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>male oriented about the disciplines and </v>

591
00:32:10.810 --> 00:32:14.590
<v Speaker 3>the evidence that that's a sociological </v>
<v Speaker 3>history period.</v>

592
00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:17.860
<v Speaker 3>Now I should also point out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because this is important,</v>

593
00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:20.470
<v Speaker 3>people have wondered for a long time if </v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

594
00:32:20.471 --> 00:32:24.510
<v Speaker 3>if the differences between men and women</v>
<v Speaker 3>say with regards to the sciences and the</v>

595
00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:25.353
<v Speaker 3>engineering had anything to do with </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence and the former prison </v>

596
00:32:29.021 --> 00:32:29.560
<v Speaker 3>department.</v>

597
00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:31.540
<v Speaker 3>There is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>summer's gone in terrible trouble at one</v>

598
00:32:31.541 --> 00:32:32.171
<v Speaker 3>point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

599
00:32:32.171 --> 00:32:33.004
<v Speaker 3>I think he had to resign because he made</v>
<v Speaker 3>a very technical claim and he said that </v>

600
00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:39.860
<v Speaker 3>if you look at the distributions of </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence for men and women,</v>

601
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.780
<v Speaker 3>imagine you have a normal distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

602
00:32:41.781 --> 00:32:44.570
<v Speaker 3>So almost everybody's at the average.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some extremely,</v>

603
00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:46.850
<v Speaker 3>extremely intelligent people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not very many.</v>

604
00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:49.270
<v Speaker 3>And there are some people who are very </v>
<v Speaker 3>intellectually imperative.</v>

605
00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:50.143
<v Speaker 3>Not very many.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you map the distributions of many </v>

606
00:32:52.131 --> 00:32:55.040
<v Speaker 3>women onto one another,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's two hypothesis.</v>

607
00:32:55.090 --> 00:32:57.200
<v Speaker 3>One hypothesis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>roughly speaking,</v>

608
00:32:57.380 --> 00:33:01.970
<v Speaker 3>is that they're the se and the evidence </v>
<v Speaker 3>for that as is reasonable.</v>

609
00:33:01.971 --> 00:33:02.804
<v Speaker 3>I would say the other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other theory is that the means are </v>

610
00:33:05.811 --> 00:33:07.460
<v Speaker 3>the same,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the meaning is the same.</v>

611
00:33:07.461 --> 00:33:10.240
<v Speaker 3>So both men and women have an average Iq</v>
<v Speaker 3>of 100,</v>

612
00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:13.690
<v Speaker 3>but the standard deviation is different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's larger amendment.</v>

613
00:33:13.691 --> 00:33:14.630
<v Speaker 3>It is in women.</v>

614
00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:15.643
<v Speaker 3>And what that means is that if you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>way the hell out into the hyper genius </v>

615
00:33:18.171 --> 00:33:19.610
<v Speaker 3>rates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're almost all men.</v>

616
00:33:19.670 --> 00:33:22.850
<v Speaker 3>But also if you go away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they log into the range where people are</v>

617
00:33:22.910 --> 00:33:26.570
<v Speaker 3>incredibly intellectually impaired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're also all men.</v>

618
00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:30.020
<v Speaker 3>And that's the increase male variability</v>
<v Speaker 3>hypothesis.</v>

619
00:33:30.021 --> 00:33:33.800
<v Speaker 3>And you see increased male variability </v>
<v Speaker 3>in and a number of different species,</v>

620
00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:36.080
<v Speaker 3>partly because men are more expendable </v>
<v Speaker 3>than limit.</v>

621
00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:38.450
<v Speaker 3>And the reason for that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>biologically speaking,</v>

622
00:33:38.451 --> 00:33:40.520
<v Speaker 3>the reason for that is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

623
00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:43.160
<v Speaker 3>you don't need that many men to </v>
<v Speaker 3>impregnate a lot of women,</v>

624
00:33:43.161 --> 00:33:43.994
<v Speaker 3>but women need women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Women are a bottleneck with regards to </v>

625
00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:49.610
<v Speaker 3>reproduction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So every woman task,</v>

626
00:33:49.670 --> 00:33:52.280
<v Speaker 3>although not every man's house and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's true many,</v>

627
00:33:52.281 --> 00:33:54.920
<v Speaker 3>many species.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you see more variability and male</v>

628
00:33:54.921 --> 00:33:57.260
<v Speaker 3>behavior because of that across species </v>
<v Speaker 3>frequently.</v>

629
00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:58.423
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that comes often added costs with </v>

630
00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:02.330
<v Speaker 3>increased male illness.</v>

631
00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:03.950
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at it guys,</v>

632
00:34:04.010 --> 00:34:04.843
<v Speaker 3>you're going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's been eight years sooner than the </v>

633
00:34:06.501 --> 00:34:09.770
<v Speaker 3>typical woman and that's partly the </v>
<v Speaker 3>price you paid for,</v>

634
00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:10.633
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

635
00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:11.473
<v Speaker 3>for running,</v>
<v Speaker 3>parking on testosterone because it's </v>

636
00:34:12.681 --> 00:34:17.300
<v Speaker 3>quite toxic over the long run.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So men are men in do page for their,</v>

637
00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:18.163
<v Speaker 3>for their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever advantages they might have and </v>

638
00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:23.250
<v Speaker 3>they paid for that with the lifespan </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's decreased by about 10 percent.</v>

639
00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:25.750
<v Speaker 3>It's a nontrivial disadvantage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But anyways,</v>

640
00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:27.620
<v Speaker 3>what Larry Summers said was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

641
00:34:27.670 --> 00:34:31.790
<v Speaker 3>if the ICU distribution is flattering </v>
<v Speaker 3>for men than for women,</v>

642
00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:35.030
<v Speaker 3>maybe one of the reason that almost all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the outstanding men in science,</v>

643
00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:35.893
<v Speaker 3>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>engineering and mathematics or mail is </v>

644
00:34:37.371 --> 00:34:41.870
<v Speaker 3>because it takes a genius level of Nike </v>
<v Speaker 3>level of say 150 or a hundred and 60.</v>

645
00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:43.970
<v Speaker 3>And when you go way out on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>distributions,</v>

646
00:34:43.971 --> 00:34:45.800
<v Speaker 3>when the distribution is different like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

647
00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:48.140
<v Speaker 3>then there's massive differences at bms.</v>

648
00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:53.000
<v Speaker 3>Now he didn't say that was by the way he</v>
<v Speaker 3>said that that was one possibility.</v>

649
00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:53.953
<v Speaker 3>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is one possibility because nature </v>

650
00:34:55.821 --> 00:34:56.654
<v Speaker 3>doesn't arrange itself so that </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything in presents to us is in </v>

651
00:34:59.661 --> 00:35:02.300
<v Speaker 3>keeping with what we would like to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>true political,</v>

652
00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:04.040
<v Speaker 3>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>quite the contrary.</v>

653
00:35:04.490 --> 00:35:05.323
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm kind of agnostic with regards to</v>
<v Speaker 3>that because I've looked at the data on </v>

654
00:35:08.211 --> 00:35:09.044
<v Speaker 3>both sides and I can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that we can make a </v>

655
00:35:11.761 --> 00:35:15.590
<v Speaker 3>determined them statement about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>differences in science,</v>

656
00:35:15.591 --> 00:35:16.670
<v Speaker 3>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>engineering,</v>

657
00:35:16.671 --> 00:35:17.504
<v Speaker 3>mathematics over representation of men </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the basis of variability and </v>

658
00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:21.363
<v Speaker 3>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I do think we can make the case in </v>

659
00:35:23.061 --> 00:35:27.770
<v Speaker 3>terms of interest because it is the case</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the biggest differences between men</v>

660
00:35:27.771 --> 00:35:30.320
<v Speaker 3>and women are differences in interest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the question is,</v>

661
00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:33.050
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do we have a problem with that?</v>

662
00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:34.730
<v Speaker 3>Because that really a problem.</v>

663
00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:36.380
<v Speaker 3>Now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you couldn't.</v>

664
00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:39.780
<v Speaker 3>You could up your culture to eradicate </v>
<v Speaker 3>those differences.</v>

665
00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:41.323
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you could make cultures very </v>

666
00:35:42.481 --> 00:35:45.390
<v Speaker 3>coercive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so if you punched boys from the time</v>

667
00:35:45.391 --> 00:35:46.224
<v Speaker 3>they were born for being interested in </v>
<v Speaker 3>things and insisted that they become </v>

668
00:35:48.871 --> 00:35:51.850
<v Speaker 3>more interested in people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then perhaps you could do that.</v>

669
00:35:51.851 --> 00:35:53.730
<v Speaker 3>It would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would come at some cost.</v>

670
00:35:53.731 --> 00:35:55.230
<v Speaker 3>And you could do the same thing for </v>
<v Speaker 3>girls,</v>

671
00:35:55.231 --> 00:35:58.380
<v Speaker 3>you could make them less interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are more interested in things,</v>

672
00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:02.760
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the degree that those differences are</v>

673
00:36:02.761 --> 00:36:07.590
<v Speaker 3>real and to the degree that they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually bombed or grounded in biology,</v>

674
00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:08.573
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have to turn your </v>
<v Speaker 3>society into something pretty damn too </v>

675
00:36:10.331 --> 00:36:13.850
<v Speaker 3>radical to produce those differences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you to do that,</v>

676
00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:15.620
<v Speaker 3>that makes you do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you want to do it?</v>

677
00:36:15.621 --> 00:36:16.454
<v Speaker 3>Is it not the big problem that men and </v>
<v Speaker 3>women actually have different interests </v>

678
00:36:18.931 --> 00:36:20.880
<v Speaker 3>and this is read that biggest surprise.</v>

679
00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:22.890
<v Speaker 3>Is that something that you want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>eradicate?</v>

680
00:36:23.770 --> 00:36:27.300
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I also felt back to bill's scene.</v>

681
00:36:27.301 --> 00:36:28.700
<v Speaker 3>16,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

682
00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:30.053
<v Speaker 3>The policies surrounding it are </v>
<v Speaker 3>incorrect and they're dangerous and </v>

683
00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:33.923
<v Speaker 3>they're dangerous partly because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>are predicated on the insistence that </v>

684
00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:40.470
<v Speaker 3>all of these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these levels of analysis with regards to</v>

685
00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:43.930
<v Speaker 3>human identity associated with </v>
<v Speaker 3>culturally constructed and they're not.</v>

686
00:36:43.931 --> 00:36:44.764
<v Speaker 3>And there's implications for that too </v>
<v Speaker 3>because one of the things that this is </v>

687
00:36:47.311 --> 00:36:48.144
<v Speaker 3>happening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly with regards to the equity </v>

688
00:36:49.921 --> 00:36:54.921
<v Speaker 3>movements.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'll define equity for you used to be</v>

689
00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:56.753
<v Speaker 3>quality and more opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it shifted to equity and in many </v>

690
00:36:59.191 --> 00:37:01.740
<v Speaker 3>universities now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like human resources department is human</v>

691
00:37:01.741 --> 00:37:02.574
<v Speaker 3>resources in their equity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They should be absolutely ashamed of </v>

692
00:37:04.861 --> 00:37:06.150
<v Speaker 3>themselves for that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

693
00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:09.330
<v Speaker 3>It is absolutely appalling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's reprehensible.</v>

694
00:37:09.570 --> 00:37:11.810
<v Speaker 3>I actually thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

695
00:37:11.830 --> 00:37:16.230
<v Speaker 3>I want to say it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's almost no political stance.</v>

696
00:37:16.290 --> 00:37:19.050
<v Speaker 3>It's more reprehensible than the stamps </v>
<v Speaker 3>that demands equity.</v>

697
00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:20.393
<v Speaker 3>It's very informed and it's being tried </v>
<v Speaker 3>very many times in very many places and </v>

698
00:37:24.721 --> 00:37:25.554
<v Speaker 3>the net result of pushing the equity </v>
<v Speaker 3>from a political perspective was not </v>

699
00:37:28.171 --> 00:37:29.004
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if people have any stats of 20th </v>

700
00:37:31.021 --> 00:37:31.854
<v Speaker 3>century history at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first thing they realized is that </v>

701
00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:36.750
<v Speaker 3>political systems based on the notion of</v>
<v Speaker 3>equity become murderous very,</v>

702
00:37:36.751 --> 00:37:38.280
<v Speaker 3>very rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so</v>

703
00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:45.010
<v Speaker 2>thank you.</v>

704
00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:50.533
<v Speaker 3>So</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's how you diagnose in an </v>

705
00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:54.233
<v Speaker 3>organization as racist and pathological.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the first thing you do is pick your </v>

706
00:37:58.821 --> 00:38:03.360
<v Speaker 3>key dimensions of identity and whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>they happen to be in the common ones are</v>

707
00:38:03.690 --> 00:38:04.700
<v Speaker 3>gender,</v>
<v Speaker 3>race,</v>

708
00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:07.940
<v Speaker 3>ethnicity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sexual proclivity,</v>

709
00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:10.310
<v Speaker 3>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there are enumerable,</v>

710
00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:11.173
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the problems is that you </v>

711
00:38:12.171 --> 00:38:14.810
<v Speaker 3>can continually in some of our people </v>
<v Speaker 3>into groups</v>

712
00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:19.430
<v Speaker 3>and the groups are relevant and also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

713
00:38:19.431 --> 00:38:21.920
<v Speaker 3>if you were concerned with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>representation,</v>

714
00:38:21.921 --> 00:38:22.754
<v Speaker 3>let's say of Hispanic women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you going to be equally concerned </v>

715
00:38:25.371 --> 00:38:26.204
<v Speaker 3>about the representation of Hispanic </v>
<v Speaker 3>women from economically deprived </v>

716
00:38:29.590 --> 00:38:30.423
<v Speaker 3>backgrounds and for rich backgrounds for</v>
<v Speaker 3>privileged about reasonably going to </v>

717
00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:36.303
<v Speaker 3>Hispanic women into those who came </v>
<v Speaker 3>through privileged and those who came </v>

718
00:38:38.290 --> 00:38:41.380
<v Speaker 3>from privileged backgrounds and further </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff divide them by.</v>

719
00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:42.730
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how about attractiveness?</v>

720
00:38:42.731 --> 00:38:44.140
<v Speaker 3>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How about wait,</v>

721
00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:46.060
<v Speaker 3>how about that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How about Iq?</v>

722
00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:48.190
<v Speaker 3>How about disability?</v>

723
00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:49.463
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can fractionating populations </v>

724
00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:54.250
<v Speaker 3>endlessly with regards to their group </v>
<v Speaker 3>identity in it so that,</v>

725
00:38:54.251 --> 00:38:55.084
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the fundamental problems </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the notion of equity just because </v>

726
00:38:56.981 --> 00:38:57.814
<v Speaker 3>you can never attain it because you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>keep fractionating the groups and so </v>

727
00:39:00.941 --> 00:39:03.420
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to attain equity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But apart from that,</v>

728
00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:05.890
<v Speaker 3>let's say that you just start with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>major categories,</v>

729
00:39:05.891 --> 00:39:06.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

730
00:39:07.450 --> 00:39:08.620
<v Speaker 3>gender,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ethnicity,</v>

731
00:39:08.621 --> 00:39:12.100
<v Speaker 3>race and sexual proclivity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's fine.</v>

732
00:39:12.101 --> 00:39:12.934
<v Speaker 3>So here's how you diagnose an </v>
<v Speaker 3>organization to find out if the people </v>

733
00:39:15.311 --> 00:39:19.090
<v Speaker 3>who run it are unconscionably biased and</v>
<v Speaker 3>prejudice.</v>

734
00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:21.820
<v Speaker 3>You look at the strategy of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>organization,</v>

735
00:39:21.821 --> 00:39:23.110
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The power structure.</v>

736
00:39:23.350 --> 00:39:24.183
<v Speaker 3>Then you take each strata and you map it</v>
<v Speaker 3>onto the demographics of the general </v>

737
00:39:27.461 --> 00:39:31.840
<v Speaker 3>population according to your particular </v>
<v Speaker 3>way of breaking down that population.</v>

738
00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:32.793
<v Speaker 3>You have to keep in mind and if there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>any lack of concordance between the </v>

739
00:39:35.891 --> 00:39:40.210
<v Speaker 3>general population and representation at</v>
<v Speaker 3>each of those levels of the hierarchy,</v>

740
00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:44.800
<v Speaker 3>then you described the whole hierarchy </v>
<v Speaker 3>as unconscionably a biased and racist.</v>

741
00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:46.033
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's convenient except that it's </v>

742
00:39:47.411 --> 00:39:48.910
<v Speaker 3>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I mean,</v>

743
00:39:49.090 --> 00:39:49.871
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing is,</v>

744
00:39:49.871 --> 00:39:50.704
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most organizations do have their share </v>

745
00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:54.013
<v Speaker 3>bikes for historical reasons and for and</v>
<v Speaker 3>for reasons that are perhaps a lot more </v>

746
00:39:57.401 --> 00:39:58.234
<v Speaker 3>unseemly that historical reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the idea that you can categorically </v>

747
00:40:01.721 --> 00:40:05.380
<v Speaker 3>state that every single difference at </v>
<v Speaker 3>every single level of the hierarchy as a</v>

748
00:40:05.381 --> 00:40:06.214
<v Speaker 3>consequence of the racial bias and </v>
<v Speaker 3>announcing the thoughts of everyone in </v>

749
00:40:10.091 --> 00:40:13.160
<v Speaker 3>the organization is absolutely appalling</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing to think,</v>

750
00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:15.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a multifaceted problem,</v>

751
00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:16.353
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why are people represented differently </v>

752
00:40:18.491 --> 00:40:19.324
<v Speaker 3>in different organizations?</v>
<v Speaker 3>While there's probably 20 reasons not </v>

753
00:40:21.491 --> 00:40:23.170
<v Speaker 3>what you can't just say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

754
00:40:23.171 --> 00:40:25.090
<v Speaker 3>it's racism or it's prejudice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

755
00:40:25.091 --> 00:40:25.870
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

756
00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:27.160
<v Speaker 3>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

757
00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:31.060
<v Speaker 3>It's probably racism and it's probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>prejudice,</v>

758
00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:32.073
<v Speaker 3>but that isn't the only reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's lots of reasons and you have to </v>

759
00:40:34.181 --> 00:40:36.310
<v Speaker 3>do a differentiated analysis first of </v>
<v Speaker 3>all,</v>

760
00:40:36.311 --> 00:40:37.144
<v Speaker 3>to understand understanding and then you</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to be very careful not to mock </v>

761
00:40:39.761 --> 00:40:43.600
<v Speaker 3>about stupidly with the organization to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make it worse than it already is,</v>

762
00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:44.913
<v Speaker 3>and so the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and let me go up the University of </v>

763
00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:48.160
<v Speaker 3>Toronto,</v>
<v Speaker 3>her department is teaching.</v>

764
00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:50.890
<v Speaker 3>It's just this straight out that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>adequately.</v>

765
00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:51.873
<v Speaker 3>If they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If the organization doesn't produce a </v>

766
00:40:53.561 --> 00:40:54.394
<v Speaker 3>population equivalent outcome,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it's racist or sexist or whatever </v>

767
00:40:59.230 --> 00:41:01.840
<v Speaker 3>you want it to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's something wrong with it and then</v>

768
00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:02.733
<v Speaker 3>where's the that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody in the organization needs to </v>

769
00:41:04.751 --> 00:41:06.280
<v Speaker 3>be reeducated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

770
00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:07.800
<v Speaker 3>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just nuts.</v>

771
00:41:07.930 --> 00:41:11.620
<v Speaker 3>It's not sensible and well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

772
00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:13.040
<v Speaker 3>these are not sensible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>

773
00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:14.673
<v Speaker 3>It's downright dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that was the other reason that I </v>

774
00:41:16.431 --> 00:41:17.264
<v Speaker 3>made the videos to begin with is because</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe that that's the least </v>

775
00:41:19.781 --> 00:41:23.260
<v Speaker 3>bit appropriate and I think it takes our</v>
<v Speaker 3>society.</v>

776
00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:26.560
<v Speaker 3>Does your path,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so all right,</v>

777
00:41:26.561 --> 00:41:28.690
<v Speaker 3>so let's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What else do I talk to you both?</v>

778
00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:30.650
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

779
00:41:30.970 --> 00:41:33.680
<v Speaker 3>so this was the last thing I was asked </v>
<v Speaker 3>to about.</v>

780
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:35.263
<v Speaker 3>So we're in a rather chaotic political </v>
<v Speaker 3>period right now and as you may have </v>

781
00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:39.973
<v Speaker 3>noticed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that certainly manifested itself in the </v>

782
00:41:41.901 --> 00:41:42.734
<v Speaker 3>American election,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is still causing all sorts of </v>

783
00:41:44.271 --> 00:41:46.640
<v Speaker 3>preservations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can see the same thing happening</v>

784
00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:49.220
<v Speaker 3>in let's say in Europe for the time </v>
<v Speaker 3>being,</v>

785
00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:49.880
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

786
00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:50.713
<v Speaker 3>What do you see happening?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Roughly speaking is that the divide </v>

787
00:41:52.761 --> 00:41:57.290
<v Speaker 3>between the left wing and the right wing</v>
<v Speaker 3>is growing and extremism on both ends is</v>

788
00:41:57.291 --> 00:41:58.124
<v Speaker 3>also growing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And really that's not a good thing </v>

789
00:41:59.690 --> 00:42:04.050
<v Speaker 3>because we've had extremist right wing </v>
<v Speaker 3>movements in the last 50 years.</v>

790
00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:06.070
<v Speaker 3>We've had extremely left wing movement </v>
<v Speaker 3>centered.</v>

791
00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:09.830
<v Speaker 3>They weren't pretty and maybe we don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to bring them back and so we have a</v>

792
00:42:09.831 --> 00:42:11.690
<v Speaker 3>serious problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

793
00:42:11.691 --> 00:42:15.950
<v Speaker 3>so let's take a look at that for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>minute and look at it seriously.</v>

794
00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:19.910
<v Speaker 3>So let's look at the left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I'm going to tell you some things</v>

795
00:42:19.911 --> 00:42:20.744
<v Speaker 3>about the left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first thing is that people vote </v>

796
00:42:24.381 --> 00:42:25.214
<v Speaker 3>their temperament and you need to </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand this because when you're </v>

797
00:42:28.101 --> 00:42:31.370
<v Speaker 3>talking to people who are across the </v>
<v Speaker 3>political divide from you,</v>

798
00:42:31.371 --> 00:42:33.620
<v Speaker 3>and I'm assuming they're relatively </v>
<v Speaker 3>reasonable people,</v>

799
00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:35.840
<v Speaker 3>we're not going to talk about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>extremist for a moment.</v>

800
00:42:36.350 --> 00:42:38.290
<v Speaker 3>If you're talking to people who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>liberal,</v>

801
00:42:38.330 --> 00:42:39.163
<v Speaker 3>left leaning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you're talking to people who are </v>

802
00:42:40.731 --> 00:42:44.840
<v Speaker 3>high in trait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>openness and low in conscientiousness.</v>

803
00:42:45.410 --> 00:42:47.360
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so that makes them roughly speaking,</v>

804
00:42:47.361 --> 00:42:51.260
<v Speaker 3>interested in ideas and creative but not</v>
<v Speaker 3>very good at implementing things.</v>

805
00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:55.550
<v Speaker 3>And then people who are on the right or </v>
<v Speaker 3>the opposite,</v>

806
00:42:55.551 --> 00:42:58.340
<v Speaker 3>they're lower loneliness and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>high in conscientiousness,</v>

807
00:42:58.790 --> 00:42:59.623
<v Speaker 3>conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that makes them not very good at </v>

808
00:43:01.221 --> 00:43:02.054
<v Speaker 3>thinking up new things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but pretty damn good at implementing </v>

809
00:43:04.461 --> 00:43:05.294
<v Speaker 3>things that already exist and so and so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing about that is that both of </v>

810
00:43:09.651 --> 00:43:10.484
<v Speaker 3>those ways of interacting with the world</v>
<v Speaker 3>are necessary under different </v>

811
00:43:13.941 --> 00:43:14.960
<v Speaker 3>conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

812
00:43:14.961 --> 00:43:17.470
<v Speaker 3>sometimes you have a good idea and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're running on it,</v>

813
00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:18.313
<v Speaker 3>and what we need are people to implement</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea just as Indian as efficiently </v>

814
00:43:20.991 --> 00:43:25.190
<v Speaker 3>and effectively and in an orderly map.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And away you go,</v>

815
00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:26.113
<v Speaker 3>but sometimes you're efficient in order </v>
<v Speaker 3>to restructure is not working anymore </v>

816
00:43:28.941 --> 00:43:29.774
<v Speaker 3>because the environment has changed </v>
<v Speaker 3>dramatically around it and you need </v>

817
00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:32.953
<v Speaker 3>troublemakers with new ideas to come in </v>
<v Speaker 3>and break things up so that you start </v>

818
00:43:36.181 --> 00:43:40.040
<v Speaker 3>moving in a different direction and new </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd for yourself or when is the time for</v>

819
00:43:40.041 --> 00:43:40.874
<v Speaker 3>the chaos of the left and when is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time for the order of the right and the </v>

820
00:43:44.451 --> 00:43:45.284
<v Speaker 3>answer to that because we don't know</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's why we have to talk because </v>

821
00:43:51.621 --> 00:43:54.320
<v Speaker 3>the like the environment moves around on</v>
<v Speaker 3>us,</v>

822
00:43:54.321 --> 00:43:54.770
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

823
00:43:54.770 --> 00:43:55.603
<v Speaker 3>It's constantly shifting underneath our </v>
<v Speaker 3>feet and sometimes it's shifts so that </v>

824
00:43:59.031 --> 00:43:59.864
<v Speaker 3>we have to shift to the left to stay in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the middle and sometimes it's shifts so </v>

825
00:44:03.021 --> 00:44:05.560
<v Speaker 3>that we have to shift to the right to </v>
<v Speaker 3>stay in the middle.</v>

826
00:44:05.570 --> 00:44:08.540
<v Speaker 3>And the only way we can figure that out </v>
<v Speaker 3>is by having political dialogue.</v>

827
00:44:08.541 --> 00:44:09.374
<v Speaker 3>And that's part of the reason why I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>strong free speech advocate isn't test </v>

828
00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:15.580
<v Speaker 3>if I shouldn't have to defend myself for</v>
<v Speaker 3>such a foolish steak.</v>

829
00:44:15.610 --> 00:44:16.310
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

830
00:44:16.310 --> 00:44:21.310
<v Speaker 2>please.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks.</v>

831
00:44:27.171 --> 00:44:27.350
<v Speaker 2>What</v>

832
00:44:27.350 --> 00:44:29.180
<v Speaker 3>freedom of speech,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

833
00:44:29.181 --> 00:44:34.181
<v Speaker 3>freedom of speech isn't a cornerstone of</v>
<v Speaker 3>our is I don't think it's reasonable.</v>

834
00:44:34.201 --> 00:44:35.034
<v Speaker 3>You can have a debate about that and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think the reason for that is that free </v>

835
00:44:38.671 --> 00:44:42.250
<v Speaker 3>speech is how people fake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you might think you finished,</v>

836
00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:43.093
<v Speaker 3>but generally you don't want to do is </v>
<v Speaker 3>rehash temperamental prejudice is over </v>

837
00:44:46.771 --> 00:44:47.604
<v Speaker 3>and over again in your mind and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually know that much until you write </v>

838
00:44:51.210 --> 00:44:53.360
<v Speaker 3>for other people or to the tarp that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people could.</v>

839
00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:54.263
<v Speaker 3>They make you think because your </v>
<v Speaker 3>assumption is just going to be that </v>

840
00:44:56.541 --> 00:44:59.400
<v Speaker 3>you're correct gen unless you've been </v>
<v Speaker 3>really think and Hartland.</v>

841
00:44:59.401 --> 00:45:02.580
<v Speaker 3>Many people can think because it really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard.</v>

842
00:45:02.730 --> 00:45:03.563
<v Speaker 3>In order to think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to fragment yourself up into </v>

843
00:45:06.061 --> 00:45:06.894
<v Speaker 3>multiple personalities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>each of which hold about opposing </v>

844
00:45:08.701 --> 00:45:09.534
<v Speaker 3>perspective and then you have to let </v>
<v Speaker 3>those opposing perspectives have a </v>

845
00:45:12.781 --> 00:45:15.210
<v Speaker 3>battle in the theater of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>imagination.</v>

846
00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:16.193
<v Speaker 3>That's a very difficult thing to do and </v>
<v Speaker 3>so don't confuse having your </v>

847
00:45:19.441 --> 00:45:20.274
<v Speaker 3>idiosyncratic prejudices with thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to be technically trained in </v>

848
00:45:23.611 --> 00:45:24.444
<v Speaker 3>order to think and it's very </v>
<v Speaker 3>uncomfortable and painful and so people </v>

849
00:45:26.461 --> 00:45:27.294
<v Speaker 3>don't like it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So generally what you do though the </v>

850
00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:33.570
<v Speaker 3>speed is that you put forth your view of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world,</v>

851
00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:38.600
<v Speaker 3>perhaps invest in internet you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also loaded with your own prejudices</v>

852
00:45:38.701 --> 00:45:41.220
<v Speaker 3>and biases because how in your ignorance</v>
<v Speaker 3>as well,</v>

853
00:45:41.250 --> 00:45:44.190
<v Speaker 3>because you have to speak from your </v>
<v Speaker 3>restricted perspective,</v>

854
00:45:44.191 --> 00:45:47.850
<v Speaker 3>knowing as little as you do know and </v>
<v Speaker 3>with your personality,</v>

855
00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:52.350
<v Speaker 3>you know first and foremost in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>utterances and then other people correct</v>

856
00:45:52.351 --> 00:45:53.184
<v Speaker 3>you and hopefully you as you enter into </v>
<v Speaker 3>a real dialogue whereby you can </v>

857
00:45:56.851 --> 00:45:57.684
<v Speaker 3>transcend the your own bias limitations </v>
<v Speaker 3>and expand the toolbox with which you </v>

858
00:46:02.131 --> 00:46:02.964
<v Speaker 3>use to work in the world and everyone </v>
<v Speaker 3>benefits from that and then you modify </v>

859
00:46:06.511 --> 00:46:09.780
<v Speaker 3>your viewpoints so that they actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>work better in the future because that's</v>

860
00:46:09.781 --> 00:46:11.220
<v Speaker 3>kind of what it means.</v>

861
00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:12.353
<v Speaker 3>What it means to have a a useful and </v>
<v Speaker 3>correct viewpoint is do you have a </v>

862
00:46:16.501 --> 00:46:20.610
<v Speaker 3>toolbox that is going to enable you to </v>
<v Speaker 3>work effectively in the world?</v>

863
00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:23.850
<v Speaker 3>And if you're too biased and too narrow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>too ignorant,</v>

864
00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:24.713
<v Speaker 3>what that means is that your toolbox is </v>
<v Speaker 3>only going to work and very narrow </v>

865
00:46:27.061 --> 00:46:29.880
<v Speaker 3>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you go out into public and you hammer</v>

866
00:46:29.881 --> 00:46:30.714
<v Speaker 3>yourself up against other people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially those who don't agree with </v>

867
00:46:33.361 --> 00:46:34.194
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could formulate the problems more </v>

868
00:46:35.641 --> 00:46:36.474
<v Speaker 3>clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can discuss the possibility for </v>

869
00:46:38.881 --> 00:46:39.714
<v Speaker 3>consensus and then you can negotiate an </v>
<v Speaker 3>implementation strategy and the </v>

870
00:46:43.231 --> 00:46:45.900
<v Speaker 3>alternative to that is that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>silent.</v>

871
00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:48.720
<v Speaker 3>You're a slave or your retirement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

872
00:46:48.750 --> 00:46:49.583
<v Speaker 3>We devolve into conflict and fighting </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's not a good idea and we don't </v>

873
00:46:53.401 --> 00:46:54.234
<v Speaker 3>have to do it because we do actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>know how to talk to each other and </v>

874
00:46:57.481 --> 00:47:02.370
<v Speaker 3>although perhaps we forget very </v>
<v Speaker 3>frequently why we should have to know.</v>

875
00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:03.233
<v Speaker 3>The other thing to think about is you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know you don't exist just for who you </v>

876
00:47:06.901 --> 00:47:07.734
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

877
00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:10.680
<v Speaker 3>You also exist for who you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be next week,</v>

878
00:47:10.770 --> 00:47:12.230
<v Speaker 3>next month,</v>
<v Speaker 3>next year,</v>

879
00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:13.223
<v Speaker 3>five years down the road and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so you're actually a collection of </v>

880
00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:16.973
<v Speaker 3>people that extends out into the future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so what that means is that you not </v>

881
00:47:20.101 --> 00:47:20.934
<v Speaker 3>only have to get along with yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to get along with all the </v>

882
00:47:22.951 --> 00:47:23.784
<v Speaker 3>people that you're going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and one of the ways to determine who </v>

883
00:47:27.241 --> 00:47:28.074
<v Speaker 3>those people that you're going to be is </v>
<v Speaker 3>to talk to other people around you </v>

884
00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:32.973
<v Speaker 3>because you're actually a collective </v>
<v Speaker 3>that extends across time and in so far </v>

885
00:47:36.281 --> 00:47:38.170
<v Speaker 3>as you're only speaking for yourself </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>

886
00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:41.170
<v Speaker 3>You're not speaking for yourself as are </v>
<v Speaker 3>distributed across time,</v>

887
00:47:41.171 --> 00:47:43.390
<v Speaker 3>but if you talked to a bunch of other </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

888
00:47:43.570 --> 00:47:47.470
<v Speaker 3>then what you're doing is approximating </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself distributed across time.</v>

889
00:47:47.650 --> 00:47:48.483
<v Speaker 3>So it's actually even in your selfish </v>
<v Speaker 3>best interest to talk to a bunch of </v>

890
00:47:52.241 --> 00:47:53.074
<v Speaker 3>other people because they did help you </v>
<v Speaker 3>represent yourself better than you were </v>

891
00:47:55.661 --> 00:47:59.980
<v Speaker 3>going to do it by yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you know why we also say it</v>

892
00:48:01.730 --> 00:48:02.563
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's other reasons that you want to </v>

893
00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:05.540
<v Speaker 3>be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Want to talk to other people to get your</v>

894
00:48:05.541 --> 00:48:07.970
<v Speaker 3>toolbox in order,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we might want to say to him,</v>

895
00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:08.660
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you.</v>

896
00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:10.660
<v Speaker 3>What should you be aiming for in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>life?</v>

897
00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:13.100
<v Speaker 3>I can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can tell you that roughly speaking,</v>

898
00:48:13.101 --> 00:48:14.990
<v Speaker 3>if you're looking for something that </v>
<v Speaker 3>will give your life,</v>

899
00:48:15.020 --> 00:48:15.770
<v Speaker 3>meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

900
00:48:15.770 --> 00:48:18.410
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's actually quite straightforward as</v>

901
00:48:18.411 --> 00:48:21.010
<v Speaker 3>far as I'm beginning to town.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is where the Ios App,</v>

902
00:48:21.020 --> 00:48:21.853
<v Speaker 3>it's so wrong that it's almost </v>
<v Speaker 3>unbelievable and as far as I'm </v>

903
00:48:24.261 --> 00:48:26.480
<v Speaker 3>concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamentally they're just escaping from</v>

904
00:48:26.481 --> 00:48:27.314
<v Speaker 3>responsibility anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though they are perfectly rational </v>

905
00:48:29.331 --> 00:48:32.360
<v Speaker 3>arguments for their nihilism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like everything's meaningless.</v>

906
00:48:32.420 --> 00:48:33.650
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

907
00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:37.430
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no pain is not meaningless.</v>

908
00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:38.713
<v Speaker 3>You're never going to meet anyone who </v>
<v Speaker 3>will tell you that their own pain is </v>

909
00:48:42.021 --> 00:48:42.854
<v Speaker 3>meaningless,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we can just forego the whole meeting </v>

910
00:48:44.490 --> 00:48:46.100
<v Speaker 3>was argument right off the bat.</v>

911
00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:48.370
<v Speaker 3>It's like there may be no positive </v>
<v Speaker 3>meeting advice.</v>

912
00:48:48.410 --> 00:48:49.243
<v Speaker 3>We can have a discussion about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but south after the negative meaning </v>

913
00:48:52.311 --> 00:48:55.610
<v Speaker 3>exists and everyone knows it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and even someone who's in Archicad,</v>

914
00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:59.180
<v Speaker 3>nihilistic to the core drug,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a spike through their hand,</v>

915
00:48:59.390 --> 00:49:00.223
<v Speaker 3>they're going to get like that has </v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning and since I've been an </v>

916
00:49:02.540 --> 00:49:03.373
<v Speaker 3>existential</v>
<v Speaker 3>and look at how people are instead of </v>

917
00:49:08.091 --> 00:49:08.924
<v Speaker 3>what they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they'll act out the idea that that </v>

918
00:49:10.551 --> 00:49:12.020
<v Speaker 3>has meaning very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very rapid,</v>

919
00:49:12.021 --> 00:49:14.420
<v Speaker 3>so we'll just go with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you might say,</v>

920
00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:16.090
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's all sorts of now,</v>

921
00:49:17.690 --> 00:49:20.630
<v Speaker 3>but that's not the kind of meaning that </v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe doesn't exist.</v>

922
00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:23.090
<v Speaker 3>I believe that only positive meaning </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't exist,</v>

923
00:49:23.091 --> 00:49:23.660
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

924
00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:25.820
<v Speaker 3>a little on the negative side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say the beginning,</v>

925
00:49:26.620 --> 00:49:27.453
<v Speaker 3>but I can understand that people have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People can have a pretty directional </v>

926
00:49:29.811 --> 00:49:30.644
<v Speaker 3>lights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

927
00:49:30.770 --> 00:49:31.603
<v Speaker 3>and you can easily get yourself in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation where it seems like there's </v>

928
00:49:33.861 --> 00:49:34.694
<v Speaker 3>nothing at all to your life except </v>
<v Speaker 3>suffering and that's what happens to </v>

929
00:49:36.951 --> 00:49:38.830
<v Speaker 3>people who become suicidal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

930
00:49:38.831 --> 00:49:41.150
<v Speaker 3>and it's no joke and they have the </v>
<v Speaker 3>reasons.</v>

931
00:49:41.151 --> 00:49:43.530
<v Speaker 3>Now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes those people have been hurt in</v>

932
00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:44.373
<v Speaker 3>ways that are absolutely unimaginable </v>
<v Speaker 3>and so when they see a horizon that's </v>

933
00:49:47.691 --> 00:49:50.810
<v Speaker 3>full of nothing but suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't just wave that away.</v>

934
00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:52.190
<v Speaker 3>But I would say</v>

935
00:49:54.970 --> 00:49:59.970
<v Speaker 3>the first thing we might hypothesize is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that sending paid is an alternative fact</v>

936
00:50:00.101 --> 00:50:02.850
<v Speaker 3>of meeting and certainly seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>negative,</v>

937
00:50:02.851 --> 00:50:03.684
<v Speaker 3>but one of the things you might want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>try to orient yourself in relationship </v>

938
00:50:06.431 --> 00:50:09.210
<v Speaker 3>to is the reduction of human suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

939
00:50:09.250 --> 00:50:10.083
<v Speaker 3>because I think that's the goal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know the answer to what do you do </v>

940
00:50:14.171 --> 00:50:16.840
<v Speaker 3>about a child who stopped wearing in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>concentration camp?</v>

941
00:50:16.890 --> 00:50:20.110
<v Speaker 3>Is it who the hell is going to care in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>million years?</v>

942
00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:22.390
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not the right answer,</v>

943
00:50:22.810 --> 00:50:25.210
<v Speaker 3>and if it's not the right answer in that</v>
<v Speaker 3>situation,</v>

944
00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:27.170
<v Speaker 3>then perhaps it's not the right answer </v>
<v Speaker 3>at all.</v>

945
00:50:27.171 --> 00:50:31.700
<v Speaker 3>And the right answer to who the hell's </v>
<v Speaker 3>gonna care anyways in a million years is</v>

946
00:50:31.701 --> 00:50:36.440
<v Speaker 3>why in the world when you frame the </v>
<v Speaker 3>mistake that idiotically mean anybody,</v>

947
00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:37.333
<v Speaker 3>anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is kind of a trick of the </v>

948
00:50:38.211 --> 00:50:39.044
<v Speaker 3>imagination in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anybody who's quick witted can come up </v>

949
00:50:42.141 --> 00:50:47.141
<v Speaker 3>with a frame of reference that makes </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything that makes almost anything lack</v>

950
00:50:47.250 --> 00:50:49.310
<v Speaker 3>meaning within that frame of reference.</v>

951
00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:50.353
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that means to me is that you picked </v>

952
00:50:51.371 --> 00:50:53.210
<v Speaker 3>a stupid frame of reference,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

953
00:50:53.211 --> 00:50:54.044
<v Speaker 3>Why should you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why should you accept without doubt the </v>

954
00:50:57.471 --> 00:50:58.304
<v Speaker 3>consequences of your stupid algorithm?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who's going to care in a million years </v>

955
00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:03.920
<v Speaker 3>gone?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

956
00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:05.540
<v Speaker 3>You got to be able to do better than </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

957
00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:07.280
<v Speaker 3>If that's what you're going to wipe out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning.</v>

958
00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:09.080
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what do you want from me?</v>

959
00:51:09.170 --> 00:51:10.550
<v Speaker 3>Alright?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Reduced software,</v>

960
00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:13.250
<v Speaker 3>that'd be a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could devote your life to that and I</v>

961
00:51:13.251 --> 00:51:14.084
<v Speaker 3>would say start locally and I think this</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the alternative to right wing </v>

962
00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:22.730
<v Speaker 3>nationalism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is too much order and chaos,</v>

963
00:51:22.731 --> 00:51:23.564
<v Speaker 3>which is too much chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't want to go down that rabbit </v>

964
00:51:25.491 --> 00:51:26.870
<v Speaker 3>hole again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>either of it.</v>

965
00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:28.153
<v Speaker 3>So what's the alternative?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought about this for a very long </v>

966
00:51:29.841 --> 00:51:30.674
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It took me decades to come to this </v>

967
00:51:31.701 --> 00:51:32.534
<v Speaker 3>conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The conclusion is just that you </v>

968
00:51:33.961 --> 00:51:36.860
<v Speaker 3>straightened yourself out and you do </v>
<v Speaker 3>that humbling.</v>

969
00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:38.780
<v Speaker 3>There's this idea that the new </v>
<v Speaker 3>testament,</v>

970
00:51:38.781 --> 00:51:39.614
<v Speaker 3>which I get quite a kick out of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're not supposed to pray in </v>

971
00:51:41.961 --> 00:51:42.794
<v Speaker 3>public.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a little more complicated than </v>

972
00:51:43.881 --> 00:51:44.361
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actually,</v>

973
00:51:44.361 --> 00:51:45.194
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm supposed to pray until you like </v>

974
00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:49.400
<v Speaker 3>sorted out the dispute that you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>with your brother.</v>

975
00:51:49.610 --> 00:51:50.443
<v Speaker 3>For example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really like that idea because what it </v>

976
00:51:53.001 --> 00:51:53.834
<v Speaker 3>means is that you shouldn't make a </v>
<v Speaker 3>public display of your virtue until you </v>

977
00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:57.223
<v Speaker 3>straighten up your damn life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is one of the things I really </v>

978
00:51:59.421 --> 00:52:00.254
<v Speaker 3>don't like about protests and I really </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't like the fact that university </v>

979
00:52:03.111 --> 00:52:03.944
<v Speaker 3>students are tired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're halfway and professors that the </v>

980
00:52:05.631 --> 00:52:06.740
<v Speaker 3>way that you changed your world.</v>

981
00:52:11.530 --> 00:52:16.530
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

982
00:52:19.750 --> 00:52:20.583
<v Speaker 3>You don't change the world by going and </v>
<v Speaker 3>waving signs of that you've defined as </v>

983
00:52:23.931 --> 00:52:28.340
<v Speaker 3>more evil than first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the probability that they're more useful</v>

984
00:52:28.341 --> 00:52:29.174
<v Speaker 3>than you is actually quite low</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they may be you're in the same </v>

985
00:52:34.431 --> 00:52:35.264
<v Speaker 3>damn boat and if you divided the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>up convenience so that you can identify </v>

986
00:52:39.111 --> 00:52:39.944
<v Speaker 3>the innocent and the and the dam or the </v>
<v Speaker 3>oppressor and oppressed and you think </v>

987
00:52:43.370 --> 00:52:44.203
<v Speaker 3>you're in the positive category,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the probability that you're a part </v>

988
00:52:46.641 --> 00:52:49.850
<v Speaker 3>of the solution and not part of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem was zero.</v>

989
00:52:51.050 --> 00:52:52.830
<v Speaker 3>So it's just not that easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

990
00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:54.800
<v Speaker 3>in the most profound people that I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever read,</v>

991
00:52:54.801 --> 00:52:57.800
<v Speaker 3>he said the same thing over and over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the line between good and evil</v>

992
00:52:57.801 --> 00:52:58.634
<v Speaker 3>runs down the middle of every human </v>
<v Speaker 3>heart and the first thing that you're </v>

993
00:53:00.831 --> 00:53:03.380
<v Speaker 3>supposed to do is with that bag on your </v>
<v Speaker 3>own territory.</v>

994
00:53:03.590 --> 00:53:04.423
<v Speaker 3>And that's bloody Joel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a difficult thing to do because </v>

995
00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:08.740
<v Speaker 3>it means that you have to recognize </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

996
00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:09.673
<v Speaker 3>Recognize yourself as a perpetrator of </v>
<v Speaker 3>gravy and that is what you are and </v>

997
00:53:13.971 --> 00:53:14.804
<v Speaker 3>that's a terrible thing for me to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know when you look at the 20th </v>

998
00:53:17.061 --> 00:53:18.860
<v Speaker 3>century and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

999
00:53:18.861 --> 00:53:22.490
<v Speaker 3>who brought on the horrors of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>communist systems and the horrors of the</v>

1000
00:53:22.491 --> 00:53:25.170
<v Speaker 3>Nazi system is the answer is people just</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you.</v>

1001
00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:28.190
<v Speaker 3>That's the answer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you don't understand that and you</v>

1002
00:53:28.191 --> 00:53:33.191
<v Speaker 3>think that answer is wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you're not very biased and it's not</v>

1003
00:53:33.451 --> 00:53:36.300
<v Speaker 3>surprising because the price that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>paid for wisdom,</v>

1004
00:53:36.301 --> 00:53:37.134
<v Speaker 3>this is radically dissimilar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Disillusionment and the confrontation </v>

1005
00:53:39.871 --> 00:53:42.840
<v Speaker 3>with evil and no one wants that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>

1006
00:53:42.930 --> 00:53:46.560
<v Speaker 3>It's a terrible thing to confront and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's because human beings are terrible</v>

1007
00:53:46.570 --> 00:53:47.580
<v Speaker 3>or preachers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1008
00:53:47.581 --> 00:53:50.880
<v Speaker 3>I think we're also absolutely remarkable</v>
<v Speaker 3>creatures and wonderful creatures,</v>

1009
00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:51.753
<v Speaker 3>but we have an unlimited capacity for </v>
<v Speaker 3>brutality and evil and every one of us </v>

1010
00:53:56.011 --> 00:53:56.844
<v Speaker 3>carries it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so what you do is you try to sort </v>

1011
00:53:59.251 --> 00:54:01.590
<v Speaker 3>that out in your own life and you start.</v>

1012
00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:06.330
<v Speaker 3>I haven't talked to me just a while back</v>
<v Speaker 3>about about his life.</v>

1013
00:54:06.340 --> 00:54:07.173
<v Speaker 3>Haven't been going very well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He decided to put himself together and </v>

1014
00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:11.100
<v Speaker 3>he started doing this little ritual </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>

1015
00:54:11.101 --> 00:54:15.330
<v Speaker 3>which I thought was quite cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was in this kind of an isolated guy,</v>

1016
00:54:15.390 --> 00:54:17.970
<v Speaker 3>very overweight guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I talk to him,</v>

1017
00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:21.060
<v Speaker 3>he lost about 130 comments,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was quite impressive for this part</v>

1018
00:54:21.061 --> 00:54:24.450
<v Speaker 3>of him putting himself together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he started doing it by bill.</v>

1019
00:54:24.451 --> 00:54:25.284
<v Speaker 3>He had a bunch of labels leftover from </v>
<v Speaker 3>his childhood and the first thing he </v>

1020
00:54:28.231 --> 00:54:29.064
<v Speaker 3>did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he was feeling very nihilistic </v>

1021
00:54:30.091 --> 00:54:30.990
<v Speaker 3>and hopeless,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1022
00:54:31.210 --> 00:54:32.043
<v Speaker 3>he found that he got a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 3>satisfaction out of building little </v>

1023
00:54:33.991 --> 00:54:35.370
<v Speaker 3>things on the blade bills,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1024
00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:37.240
<v Speaker 3>and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that was pretty interesting.</v>

1025
00:54:37.241 --> 00:54:39.450
<v Speaker 3>And so he built a bunch of these things </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then he said,</v>

1026
00:54:39.451 --> 00:54:40.950
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got a bunch of these things built.</v>

1027
00:54:40.950 --> 00:54:43.550
<v Speaker 3>Then I had to figure out how to organize</v>
<v Speaker 3>them in the room.</v>

1028
00:54:43.570 --> 00:54:46.110
<v Speaker 3>They were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought that's cool because he started</v>

1029
00:54:46.230 --> 00:54:48.420
<v Speaker 3>higher resolution at the level of </v>
<v Speaker 3>detail.</v>

1030
00:54:48.421 --> 00:54:49.254
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what he was building something that was </v>

1031
00:54:49.891 --> 00:54:51.990
<v Speaker 3>trivial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He knew that he was just playing a game,</v>

1032
00:54:52.350 --> 00:54:54.420
<v Speaker 3>but then as soon as he had a collection </v>
<v Speaker 3>of those,</v>

1033
00:54:54.421 --> 00:54:55.254
<v Speaker 3>then you have to sort out the space that</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was going to organize them in many </v>

1034
00:54:57.510 --> 00:54:58.160
<v Speaker 3>figured out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1035
00:54:58.160 --> 00:54:58.993
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just sort of the room that they were </v>

1036
00:54:59.701 --> 00:55:02.400
<v Speaker 3>going to be in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we started organizing and beautifying</v>

1037
00:55:02.410 --> 00:55:03.243
<v Speaker 3>the room and at the same time he </v>
<v Speaker 3>modified his diet and he was putting </v>

1038
00:55:05.521 --> 00:55:08.100
<v Speaker 3>himself together and that's the right </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing to do.</v>

1039
00:55:08.340 --> 00:55:11.130
<v Speaker 3>That's the right thing to do is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there is.</v>

1040
00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:13.650
<v Speaker 3>There are responsibilities that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>awaiting you,</v>

1041
00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:14.693
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are in your own grass and you know </v>

1042
00:55:16.501 --> 00:55:17.334
<v Speaker 3>what they are.</v>

1043
00:55:17.460 --> 00:55:20.600
<v Speaker 3>This is also something that no one can </v>
<v Speaker 3>preach to you about.</v>

1044
00:55:21.020 --> 00:55:21.853
<v Speaker 3>It's something you have to decide for </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself and you can do it quite </v>

1045
00:55:23.650 --> 00:55:26.880
<v Speaker 3>straightforwardly and it's something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I do on a regular basis.</v>

1046
00:55:26.881 --> 00:55:27.714
<v Speaker 3>You sit down in the or in the morning </v>
<v Speaker 3>and ask yourself like you're asking </v>

1047
00:55:33.060 --> 00:55:36.620
<v Speaker 3>someone that you want the answer from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like genuinely needed,</v>

1048
00:55:36.630 --> 00:55:39.840
<v Speaker 3>want to have the entrepreneur telling </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself none of that.</v>

1049
00:55:39.930 --> 00:55:42.810
<v Speaker 3>You're asking yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1050
00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:43.673
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch of things about my life </v>
<v Speaker 3>that aren't in order that aren't </v>

1051
00:55:45.751 --> 00:55:46.584
<v Speaker 3>together and I know it and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>making me suffer and they're making me </v>

1052
00:55:49.141 --> 00:55:49.974
<v Speaker 3>less than I am,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's some of those things that </v>

1053
00:55:52.021 --> 00:55:52.854
<v Speaker 3>are staring me right at the face and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>know what they are and there's some of </v>

1054
00:55:54.931 --> 00:55:59.430
<v Speaker 3>those that I can put in order today with</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little bit of work so that when I wake</v>

1055
00:55:59.431 --> 00:56:02.940
<v Speaker 3>up tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the domain of my experience,</v>

1056
00:56:02.941 --> 00:56:03.774
<v Speaker 3>which is basically being itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the main point experience will be </v>

1057
00:56:06.721 --> 00:56:09.270
<v Speaker 3>more pristine and better put together </v>
<v Speaker 3>than it is today,</v>

1058
00:56:09.820 --> 00:56:11.850
<v Speaker 3>and you asked yourself that you'll find </v>
<v Speaker 3>right away.</v>

1059
00:56:11.850 --> 00:56:13.680
<v Speaker 3>You know what they are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five things that come up,</v>

1060
00:56:13.681 --> 00:56:14.281
<v Speaker 3>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bang,</v>

1061
00:56:14.281 --> 00:56:14.761
<v Speaker 3>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bang,</v>

1062
00:56:14.761 --> 00:56:16.980
<v Speaker 3>and they'll all be things that aren't </v>
<v Speaker 3>very heroic.</v>

1063
00:56:16.981 --> 00:56:19.350
<v Speaker 3>They're kind of trivial and that you've </v>
<v Speaker 3>been avoiding.</v>

1064
00:56:19.890 --> 00:56:20.723
<v Speaker 3>You've been avoiding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are little dragons of chaos </v>

1065
00:56:22.771 --> 00:56:24.070
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1066
00:56:24.071 --> 00:56:26.230
<v Speaker 3>they're just little.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's good because you're not much of a</v>

1067
00:56:26.231 --> 00:56:27.064
<v Speaker 3>hero warrior and so maybe a little tiny </v>
<v Speaker 3>dragons are all the ones that you've </v>

1068
00:56:29.311 --> 00:56:31.290
<v Speaker 3>been put up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1069
00:56:31.530 --> 00:56:34.000
<v Speaker 3>do search those things out and it'll.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

1070
00:56:34.001 --> 00:56:34.834
<v Speaker 3>they will order your order,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the being around you in a more pristine </v>

1071
00:56:39.721 --> 00:56:40.554
<v Speaker 3>and productive way and they can just a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit more focused in together and </v>

1072
00:56:44.141 --> 00:56:44.974
<v Speaker 3>what that would mean is that the next </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing you can do is ask yourself the </v>

1073
00:56:46.931 --> 00:56:51.220
<v Speaker 3>same question in the end of the problems</v>
<v Speaker 3>that will emerge will be slightly larger</v>

1074
00:56:51.221 --> 00:56:52.054
<v Speaker 3>and more complex,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you can try to put those in </v>

1075
00:56:54.761 --> 00:56:55.594
<v Speaker 3>order and that will make everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>around you more pristine and benefit </v>

1076
00:56:58.790 --> 00:57:01.840
<v Speaker 3>together and it'll make you a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 3>stronger and more clear habit.</v>

1077
00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:05.200
<v Speaker 3>And then another set of problems will </v>
<v Speaker 3>emerge that's a little bit larger.</v>

1078
00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:08.740
<v Speaker 3>If you continue to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know you're asserting yourself.</v>

1079
00:57:08.750 --> 00:57:09.583
<v Speaker 3>I'll clean up your room and you put your</v>
<v Speaker 3>house in order and then you could start </v>

1080
00:57:11.861 --> 00:57:15.700
<v Speaker 3>to work in the community and by that </v>
<v Speaker 3>time you'll actually have some power and</v>

1081
00:57:15.701 --> 00:57:16.534
<v Speaker 3>some and some self confidence and some </v>
<v Speaker 3>competence and some creaminess and </v>

1082
00:57:20.231 --> 00:57:21.064
<v Speaker 3>they'll be much more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>much less likely to stupidly hit </v>

1083
00:57:23.021 --> 00:57:25.990
<v Speaker 3>something complicated with the stick and</v>
<v Speaker 3>say that you fixed it,</v>

1084
00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:30.070
<v Speaker 3>but you have to start low.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to be Carl Jung said,</v>

1085
00:57:30.100 --> 00:57:32.740
<v Speaker 3>very uninteresting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One is fairly interesting phrases.</v>

1086
00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:33.633
<v Speaker 3>He says that the reason that monitor </v>
<v Speaker 3>people can't see is because they won't </v>

1087
00:57:36.131 --> 00:57:38.300
<v Speaker 3>look low enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really liked that.</v>

1088
00:57:38.820 --> 00:57:39.653
<v Speaker 3>I mean he is an extraordinarily wise </v>
<v Speaker 3>person than what he meant by that was </v>

1089
00:57:42.071 --> 00:57:43.870
<v Speaker 3>something like what I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1090
00:57:43.871 --> 00:57:44.704
<v Speaker 3>that the secret to your existence is </v>
<v Speaker 3>right in front of you and it manifests </v>

1091
00:57:48.341 --> 00:57:50.350
<v Speaker 3>itself as all those things you know you </v>
<v Speaker 3>should do,</v>

1092
00:57:50.351 --> 00:57:51.184
<v Speaker 3>but you're avoiding because one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>things you might ask yourself this </v>

1093
00:57:53.340 --> 00:57:54.173
<v Speaker 3>curse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're useless and weak and miserable </v>

1094
00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:58.000
<v Speaker 3>and and cruel than all of those horrible</v>
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

1095
00:57:58.001 --> 00:58:01.240
<v Speaker 3>but partly that's because you're also </v>
<v Speaker 3>not what you could be an part of.</v>

1096
00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:04.240
<v Speaker 3>The reason for that is not doing what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know you shouldn't be doing,</v>

1097
00:58:04.620 --> 00:58:07.480
<v Speaker 3>so you might ask herself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because this is a very interesting game.</v>

1098
00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:11.050
<v Speaker 3>If you started doing the things that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know you should do,</v>

1099
00:58:11.410 --> 00:58:13.720
<v Speaker 3>this is a discussion with your own </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscious.</v>

1100
00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:14.823
<v Speaker 3>If you started doing those things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know you should do and you did that </v>

1101
00:58:17.411 --> 00:58:18.244
<v Speaker 3>diligently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the hell would you be like at 10 </v>

1102
00:58:19.721 --> 00:58:21.190
<v Speaker 3>years?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now?</v>

1103
00:58:21.191 --> 00:58:22.024
<v Speaker 3>That's an exciting game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's an interesting game and if you </v>

1104
00:58:25.781 --> 00:58:26.614
<v Speaker 3>play that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll find that you're a hell of a lot </v>

1105
00:58:27.401 --> 00:58:30.700
<v Speaker 3>more than you were and that's something </v>
<v Speaker 3>at least you might not hit the pinnacles</v>

1106
00:58:30.750 --> 00:58:32.650
<v Speaker 3>that you're going to be a lot lower than</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are,</v>

1107
00:58:32.740 --> 00:58:36.540
<v Speaker 3>and then if you're not leaking miserable</v>
<v Speaker 3>and wretched and sovereign,</v>

1108
00:58:36.550 --> 00:58:38.830
<v Speaker 3>dismal and self pitying and all those </v>
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

1109
00:58:38.831 --> 00:58:42.490
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be a lot less resentful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to be a lot less broom.</v>

1110
00:58:42.580 --> 00:58:45.460
<v Speaker 3>You're gonna be a lot less cruel to </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself and to other people.</v>

1111
00:58:45.570 --> 00:58:47.110
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's pretty good start.</v>

1112
00:58:47.470 --> 00:58:48.303
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if you're not a positive force for </v>

1113
00:58:49.301 --> 00:58:52.630
<v Speaker 3>good in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you just weren't wretched horrible,</v>

1114
00:58:52.631 --> 00:58:55.840
<v Speaker 3>that would be a good additional </v>
<v Speaker 3>contribution.</v>

1115
00:58:56.920 --> 00:58:59.790
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say too,</v>

1116
00:58:59.810 --> 00:59:01.810
<v Speaker 3>there's a corridor that goes along with </v>
<v Speaker 3>that</v>

1117
00:59:03.730 --> 00:59:05.680
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is so,</v>

1118
00:59:05.681 --> 00:59:07.810
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you could look at it this way.</v>

1119
00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:11.470
<v Speaker 3>This is something that I tried to </v>
<v Speaker 3>explain.</v>

1120
00:59:11.471 --> 00:59:14.480
<v Speaker 3>I did a video on Pinocchio,</v>
<v Speaker 3>couple of Videos About Pinocchio,</v>

1121
00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:15.993
<v Speaker 3>which I've been fascinated by it because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a very good illustration in poplar </v>

1122
00:59:20.050 --> 00:59:24.500
<v Speaker 3>culturally of how archives manifest </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves and how people understand the</v>

1123
00:59:24.501 --> 00:59:25.334
<v Speaker 3>archetypes even if they don't know they </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand them because it was a very </v>

1124
00:59:27.801 --> 00:59:30.860
<v Speaker 3>interesting movie and think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know you,</v>

1125
00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:34.090
<v Speaker 3>you might ask,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1126
00:59:34.560 --> 00:59:36.740
<v Speaker 3>with modern people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>think about people going to church.</v>

1127
00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:37.573
<v Speaker 3>They think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how can people believe those </v>

1128
00:59:39.190 --> 00:59:41.390
<v Speaker 3>superstitions?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fair enough.</v>

1129
00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:42.500
<v Speaker 3>Question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1130
00:59:42.501 --> 00:59:44.460
<v Speaker 3>what the hell do you think you be </v>
<v Speaker 3>moving.</v>

1131
00:59:45.640 --> 00:59:47.570
<v Speaker 3>What are you doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here you are.</v>

1132
00:59:47.571 --> 00:59:50.480
<v Speaker 3>You're probably on seem to Nokia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but whatever.</v>

1133
00:59:52.250 --> 00:59:54.250
<v Speaker 3>You're an adult,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you bring your five year old to see,</v>

1134
00:59:54.251 --> 00:59:56.150
<v Speaker 3>to know you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're just as interest is here,</v>

1135
00:59:56.151 --> 00:59:57.920
<v Speaker 3>so think about what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

1136
00:59:57.921 --> 00:59:59.360
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are drawings.</v>

1137
00:59:59.660 --> 01:00:04.660
<v Speaker 3>They're not real creatures or draws.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Second tuck wouldn't topic.</v>

1138
01:00:05.871 --> 01:00:10.871
<v Speaker 3>Who actually happens to one who is being</v>
<v Speaker 3>guided to cricket was highest goal is to</v>

1139
01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:16.080
<v Speaker 3>sell for reasons no one can understand </v>
<v Speaker 3>and somehow that makes it very turn them</v>

1140
01:00:16.081 --> 01:00:20.210
<v Speaker 3>into something that's real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like that's strange people,</v>

1141
01:00:20.410 --> 01:00:21.243
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fact that you're doing that is very </v>

1142
01:00:23.090 --> 01:00:27.760
<v Speaker 3>peculiar and it says something about </v>
<v Speaker 3>what people are means that we understand</v>

1143
01:00:27.761 --> 01:00:29.630
<v Speaker 3>the things that we don't normally </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand,</v>

1144
01:00:30.380 --> 01:00:33.500
<v Speaker 3>and so now it's a very interesting </v>
<v Speaker 3>movie.</v>

1145
01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:35.710
<v Speaker 3>I can tell you what it's fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 3>presupposition here,</v>

1146
01:00:35.711 --> 01:00:37.700
<v Speaker 3>so I'll just guide you through it very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very rapidly.</v>

1147
01:00:37.701 --> 01:00:40.790
<v Speaker 3>So the beginning of the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Japan,</v>

1148
01:00:40.820 --> 01:00:43.280
<v Speaker 3>who's who's the archetype of the good </v>
<v Speaker 3>father,</v>

1149
01:00:43.281 --> 01:00:44.114
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is an archetype that we've </v>

1150
01:00:44.871 --> 01:00:45.704
<v Speaker 3>forgotten about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does exist because our culture isn't </v>

1151
01:00:47.451 --> 01:00:48.284
<v Speaker 3>just a tyrannical patriarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As you can tell by the fact that we're </v>

1152
01:00:52.130 --> 01:00:52.963
<v Speaker 3>comfortable with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not tearing each other to shreds </v>

1153
01:00:54.470 --> 01:00:55.303
<v Speaker 3>at the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what you do in a state of </v>

1154
01:00:56.571 --> 01:00:57.920
<v Speaker 3>absolute chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1155
01:00:58.010 --> 01:01:01.940
<v Speaker 3>It's made freezing and starving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1156
01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:02.993
<v Speaker 3>And that is what one cap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have a piece and it's rare and it's </v>

1157
01:01:07.161 --> 01:01:11.240
<v Speaker 3>amazing that we have and we shouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>take it for granted because it's not the</v>

1158
01:01:11.241 --> 01:01:12.074
<v Speaker 3>normal order of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The normal order of things is </v>

1159
01:01:14.541 --> 01:01:15.374
<v Speaker 3>destructive chaos and if you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>fortunate enough to live somewhere </v>

1160
01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:19.160
<v Speaker 3>that's peaceful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>productive,</v>

1161
01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:20.413
<v Speaker 3>you should thank your lucky stars every </v>
<v Speaker 3>second of your life and if you don't do </v>

1162
01:01:23.241 --> 01:01:24.074
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that means is that you don't know </v>

1163
01:01:24.710 --> 01:01:25.543
<v Speaker 3>anything about history and you know </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing about it because things can get </v>

1164
01:01:29.210 --> 01:01:30.043
<v Speaker 3>out supposedly monsters and it happens </v>
<v Speaker 3>all the time and there's always a </v>

1165
01:01:32.271 --> 01:01:33.104
<v Speaker 3>fraction of the population thinks that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>how they like things to be and perhaps </v>

1166
01:01:36.351 --> 01:01:40.490
<v Speaker 3>there's a fraction of you that's like </v>
<v Speaker 3>two and I wouldn't nurture that fragment</v>

1167
01:01:40.690 --> 01:01:43.830
<v Speaker 3>if I miss you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless you want to go where it will take</v>

1168
01:01:43.860 --> 01:01:44.693
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

1169
01:01:45.770 --> 01:01:46.790
<v Speaker 3>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>back to</v>

1170
01:01:46.910 --> 01:01:51.910
<v Speaker 2>no</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank you,</v>

1171
01:01:57.700 --> 01:01:59.750
<v Speaker 3>and then you can tell that he's got a </v>
<v Speaker 3>warm allison.</v>

1172
01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:01.820
<v Speaker 3>It's full of toys and it's full of music</v>
<v Speaker 3>boxes,</v>

1173
01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:02.993
<v Speaker 3>scar little kit and then these goldfish </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he takes care of them and so he's a </v>

1174
01:02:05.791 --> 01:02:08.930
<v Speaker 3>good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes this pocket and then he puts us</v>

1175
01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:10.633
<v Speaker 3>on the puppet announced the final act </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the pocket kidnap his capacity to </v>

1176
01:02:13.891 --> 01:02:15.510
<v Speaker 3>speak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what you want.</v>

1177
01:02:15.511 --> 01:02:17.560
<v Speaker 3>If you're a good father is you want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>take your son,</v>

1178
01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:21.740
<v Speaker 3>turn turning into someone who can speak </v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1179
01:02:22.470 --> 01:02:23.303
<v Speaker 3>who can speak his soul,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and soldier paddle puts a smile on his </v>

1180
01:02:27.001 --> 01:02:27.834
<v Speaker 3>son's spaces as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't it be wonderful if he could be </v>

1181
01:02:30.331 --> 01:02:32.940
<v Speaker 3>a good boy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1182
01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:34.730
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't it be wonderful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1183
01:02:34.750 --> 01:02:36.200
<v Speaker 3>Because that's what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're a good father.</v>

1184
01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:39.060
<v Speaker 3>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't it be possible with this puppet</v>

1185
01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:43.410
<v Speaker 3>could actually become something genuine </v>
<v Speaker 3>and independent with its own voice?</v>

1186
01:02:43.950 --> 01:02:44.783
<v Speaker 3>While he says that sounds likely it goes</v>
<v Speaker 3>off to bed and then star appears up in </v>

1187
01:02:48.841 --> 01:02:51.330
<v Speaker 3>the window to be wishes on a star and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you think,</v>

1188
01:02:51.350 --> 01:02:52.230
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does that mean?</v>

1189
01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:54.230
<v Speaker 3>What does it mean to wish on a star?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1190
01:02:54.290 --> 01:02:55.123
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the star is the light that that gets in </v>

1191
01:02:56.111 --> 01:02:57.060
<v Speaker 3>the darkness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1192
01:02:57.061 --> 01:02:57.894
<v Speaker 3>and it's something transcendent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You go shopping to the night sky and </v>

1193
01:03:00.370 --> 01:03:01.203
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's inspiring whether you're religious </v>

1194
01:03:02.911 --> 01:03:03.744
<v Speaker 3>or not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're looking into the Internet while </v>

1195
01:03:05.161 --> 01:03:06.810
<v Speaker 3>you make a relationship with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>infinite.</v>

1196
01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:07.703
<v Speaker 3>By wishing on a star,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you raise your eyes above the horizon </v>

1197
01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:13.800
<v Speaker 3>and point at the light that beckons in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the darkness</v>

1198
01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:16.333
<v Speaker 3>and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish more than anything else that my </v>

1199
01:03:19.201 --> 01:03:22.350
<v Speaker 3>son can become a real person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what you do.</v>

1200
01:03:22.351 --> 01:03:24.960
<v Speaker 3>If you're a good for the employer may </v>
<v Speaker 3>come into a slave.</v>

1201
01:03:25.090 --> 01:03:26.280
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to be a tyrant.</v>

1202
01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:29.850
<v Speaker 3>You don't want them to be a puppet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want them to be something strong and</v>

1203
01:03:29.851 --> 01:03:31.130
<v Speaker 3>independent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Also,</v>

1204
01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:31.993
<v Speaker 3>often over it goes out into the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He faces all these different moral </v>

1205
01:03:35.641 --> 01:03:37.530
<v Speaker 3>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's armed with his conscious.</v>

1206
01:03:37.540 --> 01:03:39.910
<v Speaker 3>It turns out to be a bug,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1207
01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:41.100
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>

1208
01:03:41.250 --> 01:03:42.770
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's because things bug you.</v>

1209
01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:44.253
<v Speaker 3>You know you're conscious bugs you and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason that the conscience is </v>

1210
01:03:48.301 --> 01:03:49.134
<v Speaker 3>jimminy cricket is because that's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same initials as Jesus Christ and </v>

1211
01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:53.573
<v Speaker 3>Jimminy cricket is southern US Slang for</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ and no doubt the other </v>

1212
01:03:56.431 --> 01:03:57.264
<v Speaker 3>mangers thought that was very commonly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not telling you that the bug is a </v>

1213
01:03:59.521 --> 01:04:02.160
<v Speaker 3>very strange representation of Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's for sure.</v>

1214
01:04:02.170 --> 01:04:03.003
<v Speaker 3>What would make it into a cricketer and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's also rather error prone into </v>

1215
01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:06.173
<v Speaker 3>movies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he gets the movie doesn't have </v>

1216
01:04:07.270 --> 01:04:09.090
<v Speaker 3>precisely the affordable Christian </v>
<v Speaker 3>structure,</v>

1217
01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:10.313
<v Speaker 3>but part of the reason this took me a </v>
<v Speaker 3>long time to figure out too is that you </v>

1218
01:04:12.781 --> 01:04:14.820
<v Speaker 3>have to have a dialogue with your </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscience,</v>

1219
01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:18.660
<v Speaker 3>but it has to be a dog because it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually not 100 percent right.</v>

1220
01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:23.670
<v Speaker 3>It has to be something that you build by</v>
<v Speaker 3>having a discussion with it across time,</v>

1221
01:04:23.671 --> 01:04:25.860
<v Speaker 3>and that's actually worth Mq.</v>
<v Speaker 3>With junior cricket,</v>

1222
01:04:25.861 --> 01:04:26.694
<v Speaker 3>as the movie progresses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>both the puppet and the conscience get </v>

1223
01:04:30.271 --> 01:04:33.790
<v Speaker 3>wiser by begging themselves against the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world and the pop.</v>

1224
01:04:33.791 --> 01:04:37.750
<v Speaker 3>It has to resist the temptation of fame </v>
<v Speaker 3>and celebrity.</v>

1225
01:04:37.790 --> 01:04:39.390
<v Speaker 3>That's the first temptation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1226
01:04:39.391 --> 01:04:40.224
<v Speaker 3>Because he's asked to be an actor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is an easy way to be celebrities </v>

1227
01:04:42.781 --> 01:04:44.080
<v Speaker 3>like the Kardashians,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1228
01:04:44.081 --> 01:04:44.914
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's established without responsibility </v>

1229
01:04:46.771 --> 01:04:47.604
<v Speaker 3>or or competence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so that that exists and attraction </v>

1230
01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:52.830
<v Speaker 3>and then he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's.</v>

1231
01:04:53.070 --> 01:04:55.920
<v Speaker 3>He learns that lying is a very bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1232
01:04:55.921 --> 01:04:58.050
<v Speaker 3>That's what he's knows grocery as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get that sort of.</v>

1233
01:04:58.051 --> 01:04:58.884
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he said he's asked to present </v>

1234
01:05:01.201 --> 01:05:05.190
<v Speaker 3>himself as a victim of circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what the Fox and the coyotes.</v>

1235
01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:09.390
<v Speaker 3>And when you decided that he's too ill </v>
<v Speaker 3>to go back to school,</v>

1236
01:05:09.450 --> 01:05:10.283
<v Speaker 3>they take them to pleasure it degrees </v>
<v Speaker 3>trained to be a jackass that works for </v>

1237
01:05:12.841 --> 01:05:15.240
<v Speaker 3>slavers into soul lines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1238
01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:18.070
<v Speaker 3>Not Bad for animation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would</v>

1239
01:05:18.070 --> 01:05:20.230
<v Speaker 1>say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then at the end of the movie,</v>

1240
01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:21.153
<v Speaker 1>he tries to go back home because he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>terribly lost and he's half Jack asked </v>

1241
01:05:23.861 --> 01:05:26.360
<v Speaker 1>because the people that pleasure island </v>
<v Speaker 1>have told him,</v>

1242
01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:29.580
<v Speaker 1>taught him to do nothing but break,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I can help with</v>

1243
01:05:31.390 --> 01:05:33.550
<v Speaker 1>offers or what would you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would you say is,</v>

1244
01:05:33.790 --> 01:05:36.010
<v Speaker 1>is an appalling parallel to what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening?</v>

1245
01:05:36.011 --> 01:05:39.520
<v Speaker 1>To educate people who are being educated</v>
<v Speaker 1>in modern universities,</v>

1246
01:05:39.790 --> 01:05:43.280
<v Speaker 1>which are increasingly play houses where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're taught to break in.</v>

1247
01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:45.600
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't listen to protest is just.</v>

1248
01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:47.770
<v Speaker 1>It just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just painful.</v>

1249
01:05:48.130 --> 01:05:52.870
<v Speaker 1>Is this constant repetition of a soul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's nonsense.</v>

1250
01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:59.400
<v Speaker 1>Thank chanted this because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>protesters,</v>

1251
01:06:05.291 --> 01:06:06.124
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to convince themselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>even more desperate than they're trying </v>

1252
01:06:08.261 --> 01:06:09.094
<v Speaker 1>to convince them.</v>

1253
01:06:12.900 --> 01:06:15.040
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio goes back home,</v>

1254
01:06:15.041 --> 01:06:18.570
<v Speaker 1>half jackass and half again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he tries to find his father.</v>

1255
01:06:18.700 --> 01:06:21.670
<v Speaker 1>There's no going home right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you're an adult,</v>

1256
01:06:21.710 --> 01:06:22.543
<v Speaker 1>it's your young adult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't get to go back because there </v>

1257
01:06:24.641 --> 01:06:26.620
<v Speaker 1>isn't anyone there that can tell you </v>
<v Speaker 1>what to do anymore,</v>

1258
01:06:27.070 --> 01:06:27.903
<v Speaker 1>and so they go and allocate those homes </v>
<v Speaker 1>and his father isn't there and then </v>

1259
01:06:30.630 --> 01:06:31.463
<v Speaker 1>finds out that he has to go to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom of chaos itself to rescue his </v>

1260
01:06:33.701 --> 01:06:36.520
<v Speaker 1>father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what we have to do it right,</v>

1261
01:06:36.521 --> 01:06:37.354
<v Speaker 1>because our civilization is in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>state of crisis now is predicted long </v>

1262
01:06:40.061 --> 01:06:44.110
<v Speaker 1>ago by people like Nisha Dusty Dustier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and partly what you're trying to do with</v>

1263
01:06:44.111 --> 01:06:44.944
<v Speaker 1>you go to university is to go to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>heart of darkness right to the place </v>

1264
01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:50.170
<v Speaker 1>that terrifies you the most and define </v>
<v Speaker 1>your values,</v>

1265
01:06:50.180 --> 01:06:51.013
<v Speaker 1>your culture really has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what it means to go down to </v>

1266
01:06:52.961 --> 01:06:54.050
<v Speaker 1>the bottom of the desk.</v>

1267
01:06:54.100 --> 01:06:54.933
<v Speaker 1>The thing that terrifies you the most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>integrative before your father to very </v>

1268
01:06:57.701 --> 01:06:58.534
<v Speaker 1>little story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Egyptians were telling that story </v>

1269
01:07:00.221 --> 01:07:01.054
<v Speaker 1>for a thousand years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the oldest stories of </v>

1270
01:07:02.621 --> 01:07:04.890
<v Speaker 1>mankind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that's what you have to do.</v>

1271
01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:07.510
<v Speaker 1>You and you united yourself with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>

1272
01:07:07.511 --> 01:07:10.510
<v Speaker 1>so you're more than just a week and </v>
<v Speaker 1>simple minded individual,</v>

1273
01:07:10.540 --> 01:07:11.373
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You dedicate yourself to the study of </v>

1274
01:07:12.761 --> 01:07:13.594
<v Speaker 1>what's great about the past and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>incorporate it so that there can be </v>

1275
01:07:15.881 --> 01:07:16.714
<v Speaker 1>something to you and then you bring your</v>
<v Speaker 1>father back up to the surface so that </v>

1276
01:07:19.691 --> 01:07:20.524
<v Speaker 1>the culture can see and live yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then that makes you into a real </v>

1277
01:07:23.111 --> 01:07:24.300
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1278
01:07:24.310 --> 01:07:26.410
<v Speaker 1>that's the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1279
01:07:27.370 --> 01:07:32.320
<v Speaker 1>we watch it were captivated by it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's time to understand.</v>

1280
01:07:32.321 --> 01:07:33.154
<v Speaker 1>It takes time to understand that in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>articulated and conscious map because </v>

1281
01:07:37.030 --> 01:07:39.820
<v Speaker 1>it's too late for us to be unconscious </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

1282
01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:42.850
<v Speaker 1>And so we have silla and shrimp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

1283
01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:45.160
<v Speaker 1>we have the chaos of the left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The left says,</v>

1284
01:07:45.161 --> 01:07:45.994
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to tear down structures because </v>

1285
01:07:47.261 --> 01:07:48.094
<v Speaker 1>they press.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously structures will press because </v>

1286
01:07:51.191 --> 01:07:54.910
<v Speaker 1>something's good at the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure and also good at the bar.</v>

1287
01:07:54.970 --> 01:07:55.803
<v Speaker 1>So if you have any values dropped you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to privilege somethings and </v>

1288
01:07:58.630 --> 01:07:59.463
<v Speaker 1>exclude others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you scrap the value structures </v>

1289
01:08:01.301 --> 01:08:04.300
<v Speaker 1>then there's nothing to live for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we can't do that.</v>

1290
01:08:04.301 --> 01:08:05.134
<v Speaker 1>That's just chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the radical right says back to </v>

1291
01:08:07.451 --> 01:08:11.110
<v Speaker 1>the nations like really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1292
01:08:11.170 --> 01:08:13.190
<v Speaker 1>we went back to the nation a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>

1293
01:08:13.290 --> 01:08:16.160
<v Speaker 1>so it doesn't really look that great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of the reason</v>

1294
01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:19.070
<v Speaker 3>for that is that the purpose of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>nation isn't the nation.</v>

1295
01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:20.473
<v Speaker 3>The purpose of the nation is to produce </v>
<v Speaker 3>citizens who transcend and rejuvenate </v>

1296
01:08:24.351 --> 01:08:25.184
<v Speaker 3>the nation and so the nation should be </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably properly subordinating to the </v>

1297
01:08:28.641 --> 01:08:29.474
<v Speaker 3>individual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right to the divine individual for that </v>

1298
01:08:31.311 --> 01:08:32.144
<v Speaker 3>map,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's what we figured out in the </v>

1299
01:08:33.651 --> 01:08:34.484
<v Speaker 3>West.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it is that we only figured that out </v>

1300
01:08:36.921 --> 01:08:37.754
<v Speaker 3>in the west,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but so far we've been fortunate enough </v>

1301
01:08:39.171 --> 01:08:43.490
<v Speaker 3>to put it into a reasonable practice in </v>
<v Speaker 3>our political institutions and thank God</v>

1302
01:08:43.491 --> 01:08:44.324
<v Speaker 3>for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At least it's worked somewhere and we'd </v>

1303
01:08:46.671 --> 01:08:47.504
<v Speaker 3>be completely foolish to give that up </v>
<v Speaker 3>because look at what it's provided us </v>

1304
01:08:50.211 --> 01:08:53.960
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's remarkable for free,</v>

1305
01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:55.153
<v Speaker 3>as free as we can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't mean that we're happy </v>

1306
01:08:56.421 --> 01:08:59.090
<v Speaker 3>because freedom and happiness are not </v>
<v Speaker 3>the same thing at all.</v>

1307
01:08:59.120 --> 01:08:59.953
<v Speaker 3>But we did figure out that the state </v>
<v Speaker 3>should be subordinate to the wisdom of </v>

1308
01:09:02.901 --> 01:09:04.160
<v Speaker 3>the individual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the site,</v>

1309
01:09:04.161 --> 01:09:08.260
<v Speaker 3>and the wisdom of the individual puts a </v>
<v Speaker 3>heavy responsibility on everyone.</v>

1310
01:09:08.270 --> 01:09:09.103
<v Speaker 3>That mean to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have to be the wise individual who can </v>

1311
01:09:11.181 --> 01:09:14.300
<v Speaker 3>see at speed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's your job,</v>

1312
01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:15.433
<v Speaker 3>and if you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing that's so cool about that is </v>

1313
01:09:17.470 --> 01:09:18.303
<v Speaker 3>you know you need a meaning in your life</v>
<v Speaker 3>that enables you to bear to the </v>

1314
01:09:20.890 --> 01:09:23.390
<v Speaker 3>suffering of their life without becoming</v>
<v Speaker 3>corrupted.</v>

1315
01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:25.153
<v Speaker 3>That's the basic rule and you have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>build yourself into something that you </v>

1316
01:09:28.581 --> 01:09:29.414
<v Speaker 3>can actually respect so that you can see</v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself bearing that terrible </v>

1317
01:09:33.831 --> 01:09:37.220
<v Speaker 3>existential burden properly and then you</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't lose hope.</v>

1318
01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:38.253
<v Speaker 3>Don't lose meaning because you can see </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're strong enough to stand up </v>

1319
01:09:40.851 --> 01:09:44.690
<v Speaker 3>underneath that burden and then there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>something about you that you can respect</v>

1320
01:09:44.830 --> 01:09:45.663
<v Speaker 3>and then maybe other people can respect </v>
<v Speaker 3>that will help bring suffering in the </v>

1321
01:09:48.231 --> 01:09:49.064
<v Speaker 3>world to an end and that will help </v>
<v Speaker 3>people develop fully as individuals and </v>

1322
01:09:52.461 --> 01:09:53.294
<v Speaker 3>that will enable us to avoid the </v>
<v Speaker 3>dehumanizing rigid a stair I'll </v>

1323
01:09:59.121 --> 01:10:04.121
<v Speaker 3>uniformity of the nationalistic left and</v>
<v Speaker 3>a hallway chaotic devouring chaos of the</v>

1324
01:10:06.051 --> 01:10:09.350
<v Speaker 3>radical left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How about no</v>

1325
01:10:11.470 --> 01:10:12.460
<v Speaker 2>the individual?</v>

1326
01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:16.460
<v Speaker 3>That's the secret to the world and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're all individuals.</v>

1327
01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:20.780
<v Speaker 3>You're all the secret to the world and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then all you have to do</v>

1328
01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:28.420
<v Speaker 3>to discover that is picked up in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>damn responsibility.</v>

1329
01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:32.290
<v Speaker 3>Stop listening to people who keep </v>
<v Speaker 3>burdening you with rights.</v>

1330
01:10:32.291 --> 01:10:37.291
<v Speaker 3>How many Goddamn right steel?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do you need some responsibility?</v>

1331
01:10:37.570 --> 01:10:38.403
<v Speaker 3>So pick it up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>open your eyes and learn how to make </v>

1332
01:10:41.411 --> 01:10:42.244
<v Speaker 3>yourself articulate and that way the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world will just send them to the series </v>

1333
01:10:45.611 --> 01:10:49.140
<v Speaker 3>of health that it already descended into</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the 20th century.</v>

1334
01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:58.440
<v Speaker 2>Thank</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1335
01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:11.720
<v Speaker 3>Well that's probably just as good a </v>
<v Speaker 3>place as any to end.</v>

1336
01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:19.470
<v Speaker 3>I think in principle we have time for </v>
<v Speaker 3>questions.</v>

1337
01:11:19.471 --> 01:11:21.080
<v Speaker 3>Is that correct?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You?</v>

1338
01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:23.820
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we'll start with you.</v>

1339
01:11:25.470 --> 01:11:27.740
<v Speaker 3>Do you want to use the Mike?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1340
01:11:27.741 --> 01:11:28.574
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'd ask you to try to keep your </v>

1341
01:11:33.281 --> 01:11:35.100
<v Speaker 3>questions relatively short,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

1342
01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:35.993
<v Speaker 3>so see if you can get them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>articulate it out to the point where </v>

1343
01:11:37.981 --> 01:11:41.730
<v Speaker 3>they can be relatively concise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm weirdly you.</v>

1344
01:11:41.770 --> 01:11:42.603
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about the idea that like </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you see a distinction between </v>

1345
01:11:46.591 --> 01:11:50.310
<v Speaker 3>gender and sex and like I'm not saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1346
01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:51.233
<v Speaker 3>like you need are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You said they are connected and I'm </v>

1347
01:11:55.381 --> 01:11:56.214
<v Speaker 3>wondering like the idea that because we </v>
<v Speaker 3>can find an example of a non connected </v>

1348
01:11:59.100 --> 01:12:00.780
<v Speaker 3>that means that they necessarily are </v>
<v Speaker 3>connected,</v>

1349
01:12:00.781 --> 01:12:04.320
<v Speaker 3>like where does that idea come from?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It comes from wishful thinking.</v>

1350
01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:06.613
<v Speaker 3>It comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a deep question underneath that </v>

1351
01:12:08.401 --> 01:12:09.234
<v Speaker 3>and the wishes that human nature for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>infinitely malleable and that the state </v>

1352
01:12:12.171 --> 01:12:14.610
<v Speaker 3>will determine the direction that that </v>
<v Speaker 3>malleability should,</v>

1353
01:12:14.970 --> 01:12:15.803
<v Speaker 3>should take.</v>

1354
01:12:16.350 --> 01:12:18.180
<v Speaker 3>That's the fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the unreliable.</v>

1355
01:12:19.020 --> 01:12:19.853
<v Speaker 3>Now I suppose there's also a wish to </v>
<v Speaker 3>some degree that we can all burst the </v>

1356
01:12:22.681 --> 01:12:24.460
<v Speaker 3>bonds that define us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1357
01:12:24.570 --> 01:12:27.660
<v Speaker 3>in a particular way that you can ask </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself if you already want to do that.</v>

1358
01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:30.740
<v Speaker 3>One of the things I see happening to </v>
<v Speaker 3>young people that I think is terrible is</v>

1359
01:12:30.750 --> 01:12:35.750
<v Speaker 3>that they're asked to abandon their </v>
<v Speaker 3>identity before they even have one,</v>

1360
01:12:36.510 --> 01:12:37.343
<v Speaker 3>and so then they turned to these group </v>
<v Speaker 3>identities which are extraordinarily </v>

1361
01:12:40.051 --> 01:12:41.780
<v Speaker 3>shallow or very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very shallow.</v>

1362
01:12:41.810 --> 01:12:42.643
<v Speaker 3>How important,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how are we going to get through life </v>

1363
01:12:44.071 --> 01:12:47.010
<v Speaker 3>being a transsexual?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not an identity.</v>

1364
01:12:47.070 --> 01:12:49.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying there are no transexuals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that,</v>

1365
01:12:50.310 --> 01:12:52.500
<v Speaker 3>but you don't get through life as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>black person.</v>

1366
01:12:52.590 --> 01:12:54.480
<v Speaker 3>You don't get through life as a white </v>
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>

1367
01:12:54.810 --> 01:12:57.690
<v Speaker 3>You get through life by having a </v>
<v Speaker 3>differentiated identity.</v>

1368
01:12:57.810 --> 01:13:02.540
<v Speaker 3>That's the toolbox that you use to </v>
<v Speaker 3>interact with others and part of now,</v>

1369
01:13:02.650 --> 01:13:03.483
<v Speaker 3>part of that means that you have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>accept certain limitations on who you </v>

1370
01:13:05.671 --> 01:13:06.504
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you want those limitations because </v>

1371
01:13:08.041 --> 01:13:11.040
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing worse than total </v>
<v Speaker 3>freedom.</v>

1372
01:13:11.870 --> 01:13:12.703
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're dropped someone out in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ocean right in the middle of the </v>

1373
01:13:15.331 --> 01:13:18.420
<v Speaker 3>ocean with no direction and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're free to swim any way you want.</v>

1374
01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:22.260
<v Speaker 3>What are you going to do with that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to have an identity,</v>

1375
01:13:22.860 --> 01:13:27.860
<v Speaker 3>so that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

1376
01:13:32.550 --> 01:13:33.383
<v Speaker 3>How about here?</v>

1377
01:13:39.220 --> 01:13:44.100
<v Speaker 3>My blessing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just want to say</v>

1378
01:13:50.730 --> 01:13:55.730
<v Speaker 3>thank goodness I'm actually a </v>
<v Speaker 3>transplant.</v>

1379
01:14:01.700 --> 01:14:04.300
<v Speaker 3>If you put English language,</v>
<v Speaker 3>orange,</v>

1380
01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:08.780
<v Speaker 3>apple,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think any of us could actually be.</v>

1381
01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:10.673
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the question is about gender neutral </v>

1382
01:14:12.191 --> 01:14:17.191
<v Speaker 3>pronouns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think any of us would be here?</v>

1383
01:14:18.820 --> 01:14:21.530
<v Speaker 3>The issues that we're discussing would </v>
<v Speaker 3>come up in another way?</v>

1384
01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:22.870
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I think.</v>

1385
01:14:23.220 --> 01:14:24.053
<v Speaker 3>I think everyone knows that whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about has very little to </v>

1386
01:14:26.411 --> 01:14:31.411
<v Speaker 3>do with gender pronouns mean and people </v>
<v Speaker 3>have asked me why I chose deliver data,</v>

1387
01:14:32.410 --> 01:14:34.450
<v Speaker 3>let's say on that particular amount.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>

1388
01:14:34.451 --> 01:14:35.284
<v Speaker 3>well the answer to that is you have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>pick some place that's actionable to </v>

1389
01:14:37.930 --> 01:14:38.910
<v Speaker 3>stamp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1390
01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:39.933
<v Speaker 3>And the problem with that is that it </v>
<v Speaker 3>might be somewhat observed while you've </v>

1391
01:14:42.591 --> 01:14:43.690
<v Speaker 3>been in a battle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1392
01:14:43.691 --> 01:14:44.680
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1393
01:14:44.681 --> 01:14:46.750
<v Speaker 3>who cares if you take the next yard of </v>
<v Speaker 3>ground,</v>

1394
01:14:46.810 --> 01:14:48.370
<v Speaker 3>why would you die over that?</v>

1395
01:14:48.430 --> 01:14:50.180
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you think about it that way,</v>

1396
01:14:50.181 --> 01:14:51.670
<v Speaker 3>it's fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's foolish,</v>

1397
01:14:52.030 --> 01:14:52.863
<v Speaker 3>but you have to make the abstract </v>
<v Speaker 3>concrete before you can actually engage </v>

1398
01:14:56.111 --> 01:14:59.020
<v Speaker 3>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it just so happened that this was</v>

1399
01:14:59.021 --> 01:15:01.170
<v Speaker 3>the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do believe that if,</v>

1400
01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:04.180
<v Speaker 3>if there were gender neutral pronouns in</v>
<v Speaker 3>English,</v>

1401
01:15:04.210 --> 01:15:05.043
<v Speaker 3>then then this will just come up some </v>
<v Speaker 3>other way because political correctness </v>

1402
01:15:08.250 --> 01:15:09.083
<v Speaker 3>and the and the polarization between </v>
<v Speaker 3>right and left were occurring long </v>

1403
01:15:11.831 --> 01:15:14.140
<v Speaker 3>before this particular issue manifested </v>
<v Speaker 3>itself.</v>

1404
01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:17.120
<v Speaker 3>So</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

1405
01:15:17.220 --> 01:15:18.053
<v Speaker 3>with the glasses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll repeat the questions and then </v>

1406
01:15:19.970 --> 01:15:21.670
<v Speaker 3>everybody can hear them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'll be a little faster.</v>

1407
01:15:22.710 --> 01:15:24.350
<v Speaker 1>Just to start off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you familiar with?</v>

1408
01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:27.210
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1409
01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:33.360
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think my medic period,</v>

1410
01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:34.253
<v Speaker 1>a usefulness is an understanding our </v>
<v Speaker 1>components that go into how violence is </v>

1411
01:15:38.531 --> 01:15:40.150
<v Speaker 1>created.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

1412
01:15:40.190 --> 01:15:42.970
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you offer some examples of combating</v>

1413
01:15:42.971 --> 01:15:46.870
<v Speaker 1>or opposing the norm of scapegoating </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals?</v>

1414
01:15:47.340 --> 01:15:48.890
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1415
01:15:49.030 --> 01:15:50.790
<v Speaker 1>because it correct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1416
01:15:50.810 --> 01:15:53.680
<v Speaker 1>and societies and social groups or </v>
<v Speaker 1>strengthened into their violence.</v>

1417
01:15:54.940 --> 01:15:57.600
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do we drive the wedge between them?</v>

1418
01:15:57.610 --> 01:15:58.443
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1419
01:15:59.070 --> 01:15:59.903
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you have to escape the right </v>

1420
01:16:00.900 --> 01:16:02.460
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1421
01:16:02.850 --> 01:16:04.720
<v Speaker 3>because the reasonable level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's in the world.</v>

1422
01:16:05.420 --> 01:16:10.420
<v Speaker 3>That's another thing that we've </v>
<v Speaker 3>forgotten about in modern parlance.</v>

1423
01:16:11.191 --> 01:16:13.620
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've talked about for a very long period</v>

1424
01:16:13.621 --> 01:16:16.950
<v Speaker 3>of time is my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my colleagues tend to look askance at me</v>

1425
01:16:17.130 --> 01:16:18.720
<v Speaker 3>because they don't believe in such a </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

1426
01:16:18.721 --> 01:16:19.680
<v Speaker 3>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1427
01:16:21.140 --> 01:16:22.230
<v Speaker 3>well first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

1428
01:16:22.231 --> 01:16:26.160
<v Speaker 3>you do believe in it whether you do or </v>
<v Speaker 3>not.</v>

1429
01:16:26.220 --> 01:16:27.053
<v Speaker 3>If you don't bring your heaviness end,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless you're willing to say for </v>

1430
01:16:29.251 --> 01:16:32.550
<v Speaker 3>example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was unit seven,</v>

1431
01:16:32.551 --> 01:16:33.384
<v Speaker 3>nine one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys who don't think distance of </v>

1432
01:16:35.461 --> 01:16:36.294
<v Speaker 3>evil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go online and read about them at </v>

1433
01:16:37.341 --> 01:16:38.174
<v Speaker 3>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nine months and then you see what you </v>

1434
01:16:39.031 --> 01:16:39.864
<v Speaker 3>think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I told you about this done in China </v>

1435
01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:46.320
<v Speaker 3>before World War Two by the Japanese,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1436
01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:49.890
<v Speaker 3>scientific investigative squads,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

1437
01:16:52.260 --> 01:16:53.093
<v Speaker 3>that's the sort of thing that the things</v>
<v Speaker 3>that were done by that unit were so </v>

1438
01:16:56.671 --> 01:16:57.504
<v Speaker 3>terrible that I would not discuss them </v>
<v Speaker 3>before an audience without a trigger </v>

1439
01:17:00.331 --> 01:17:01.164
<v Speaker 3>warning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they would burn themselves into </v>

1440
01:17:02.881 --> 01:17:06.240
<v Speaker 3>your imagination and you would never </v>
<v Speaker 3>forget them for the rest of your life.</v>

1441
01:17:06.930 --> 01:17:09.030
<v Speaker 3>And if you can invest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was 7:31,</v>

1442
01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:09.873
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you can investigate that and come to </v>

1443
01:17:11.631 --> 01:17:13.580
<v Speaker 3>the conclusion that there's no such </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing as evil,</v>

1444
01:17:13.650 --> 01:17:14.483
<v Speaker 3>then that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You go ahead and live that way and just </v>

1445
01:17:17.391 --> 01:17:19.680
<v Speaker 3>see how far it gets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1446
01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:21.673
<v Speaker 3>so we need to localize malevolence luck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the other thing I want to tell you </v>

1447
01:17:24.741 --> 01:17:25.574
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that people have encounters with </v>

1448
01:17:26.421 --> 01:17:27.254
<v Speaker 3>malevolence in their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it often produces posttraumatic </v>

1449
01:17:30.470 --> 01:17:31.303
<v Speaker 3>stress disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so very frequently soldiers develop </v>

1450
01:17:35.540 --> 01:17:38.280
<v Speaker 3>posttraumatic stress disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not because of what they observed,</v>

1451
01:17:38.820 --> 01:17:39.653
<v Speaker 3>what they observe themselves doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they observe themselves doing </v>

1452
01:17:43.101 --> 01:17:46.670
<v Speaker 3>something absolutely vicious on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>front and they think,</v>

1453
01:17:46.671 --> 01:17:49.550
<v Speaker 3>where did that come from?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't think that's who I was at all.</v>

1454
01:17:49.551 --> 01:17:54.200
<v Speaker 3>It's like you didn't think so because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you were never in a situation like that.</v>

1455
01:17:54.350 --> 01:17:58.640
<v Speaker 3>You've never had a chance to reveal to </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself exactly what you were light and</v>

1456
01:17:58.641 --> 01:18:00.350
<v Speaker 3>then other people can develop.</v>

1457
01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:01.193
<v Speaker 3>Post traumatic stress disorder are often</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who have been encountered with </v>

1458
01:18:03.771 --> 01:18:07.550
<v Speaker 3>someone who is truly malevolent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who really truly wanted to hurt,</v>

1459
01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:08.713
<v Speaker 3>and there's no room in their philosophy </v>
<v Speaker 3>of being for that sort of that sort of </v>

1460
01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:12.913
<v Speaker 3>event or action.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just fragments them and they never </v>

1461
01:18:15.021 --> 01:18:16.790
<v Speaker 3>recover.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They often never recovered.</v>

1462
01:18:16.910 --> 01:18:20.630
<v Speaker 3>They have to develop a fully fledged </v>
<v Speaker 3>philosophy of evil in order to recover.</v>

1463
01:18:21.180 --> 01:18:22.013
<v Speaker 3>Understand that there are people who are</v>
<v Speaker 3>malevolent and that malevolence exists </v>

1464
01:18:24.471 --> 01:18:25.304
<v Speaker 3>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you can put it on someone else and </v>

1465
01:18:28.300 --> 01:18:32.240
<v Speaker 3>even punish them for it and you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>chase them away and then you can pretend</v>

1466
01:18:32.241 --> 01:18:36.230
<v Speaker 3>that it's got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it never goes away and the right way</v>

1467
01:18:36.231 --> 01:18:40.130
<v Speaker 3>to deal with it is to find the thing in </v>
<v Speaker 3>you that that into work,</v>

1468
01:18:40.131 --> 01:18:41.960
<v Speaker 3>to comprehend them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to control it.</v>

1469
01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:42.913
<v Speaker 3>It also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that's very </v>

1470
01:18:43.611 --> 01:18:48.080
<v Speaker 3>interesting about that is it also makes </v>
<v Speaker 3>you extraordinarily tough if you do it,</v>

1471
01:18:48.430 --> 01:18:51.340
<v Speaker 3>and I can give you a pop culture example</v>
<v Speaker 3>of that.</v>

1472
01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:55.030
<v Speaker 3>So Harry Potter obviously has an nmp </v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1473
01:18:55.031 --> 01:18:55.864
<v Speaker 3>and that's voldemort and if you can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>see the sale Christ and safety lurking </v>

1474
01:18:59.211 --> 01:19:00.044
<v Speaker 3>behind those figures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you're really not using your </v>

1475
01:19:01.401 --> 01:19:03.410
<v Speaker 3>imagination to any great degree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There.</v>

1476
01:19:03.420 --> 01:19:04.880
<v Speaker 3>Archetype will fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1477
01:19:05.270 --> 01:19:06.103
<v Speaker 3>And the thing about Harry Potter is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only reason that he can face photo </v>

1478
01:19:08.770 --> 01:19:11.960
<v Speaker 3>artist because he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got a touch of evil inside of it.</v>

1479
01:19:12.020 --> 01:19:12.853
<v Speaker 3>It's embedded inside of it and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>extraordinarily useful to know that </v>

1480
01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:21.260
<v Speaker 3>because it's very useful to be a monster</v>
<v Speaker 3>or more importantly,</v>

1481
01:19:21.261 --> 01:19:25.130
<v Speaker 3>it's very useful to be able to be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>monster because if you can be a monster,</v>

1482
01:19:25.131 --> 01:19:27.710
<v Speaker 3>you can stand up for yourself or for </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything else.</v>

1483
01:19:28.130 --> 01:19:30.500
<v Speaker 3>So the trick is to take that monster </v>
<v Speaker 3>inside of me,</v>

1484
01:19:30.501 --> 01:19:31.334
<v Speaker 3>went to incorporate it into using it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you don't have to escape to go </v>

1485
01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:35.273
<v Speaker 3>to other people and you can constrain </v>
<v Speaker 3>the spread of eagles starting with </v>

1486
01:19:37.731 --> 01:19:39.640
<v Speaker 3>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

1487
01:19:39.650 --> 01:19:41.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people that you admire,</v>

1488
01:19:41.690 --> 01:19:43.820
<v Speaker 3>whether you're men or women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have exactly that.</v>

1489
01:19:43.900 --> 01:19:46.910
<v Speaker 3>Ask it because women do not like armless</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1490
01:19:47.300 --> 01:19:48.133
<v Speaker 3>They like dangerous men who were </v>
<v Speaker 3>civilized and men have no respect for </v>

1491
01:19:51.021 --> 01:19:51.854
<v Speaker 3>armless man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They like dangerous men who are </v>

1492
01:19:53.151 --> 01:19:53.984
<v Speaker 3>civilized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the trick for madness to turn </v>

1493
01:19:55.431 --> 01:19:58.170
<v Speaker 3>yourself into a dangerous man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Civilized.</v>

1494
01:19:58.520 --> 01:19:59.353
<v Speaker 3>And I would say that the most dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 3>man is the person who can speak </v>

1495
01:20:03.021 --> 01:20:04.970
<v Speaker 3>properly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I mean,</v>

1496
01:20:04.971 --> 01:20:08.010
<v Speaker 3>there's other forms of dangerousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing with physical products.</v>

1497
01:20:08.540 --> 01:20:09.373
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing wrong with all of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>multidimensional ways that you could </v>

1498
01:20:12.241 --> 01:20:14.730
<v Speaker 1>learn to be dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the highest,</v>

1499
01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:20.120
<v Speaker 1>the highest order danger is articulated </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech and wealth.</v>

1500
01:20:20.610 --> 01:20:23.310
<v Speaker 1>For all these reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's speech Buddhists in the world.</v>

1501
01:20:23.460 --> 01:20:27.090
<v Speaker 1>And so get your scapegoats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1502
01:20:30.650 --> 01:20:31.483
<v Speaker 1>So you think great deal of time talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about free speech and political </v>

1503
01:20:35.241 --> 01:20:38.040
<v Speaker 1>correctness on campus in the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States,</v>

1504
01:20:38.041 --> 01:20:43.041
<v Speaker 1>we see places like University of Chicago</v>
<v Speaker 1>stand against political correctness,</v>

1505
01:20:45.750 --> 01:20:46.583
<v Speaker 1>free speech on campuses in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you say that our universities in </v>

1506
01:20:50.821 --> 01:20:55.800
<v Speaker 1>particular and a particular university </v>
<v Speaker 1>departments that have done a good job at</v>

1507
01:20:55.801 --> 01:20:56.634
<v Speaker 1>standing up for free speech and standing</v>
<v Speaker 1>up against political correctness on </v>

1508
01:21:00.910 --> 01:21:01.940
<v Speaker 1>campus?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1509
01:21:01.980 --> 01:21:02.813
<v Speaker 1>I would say Canada or the sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>question is that Jonathan Heit and his </v>

1510
01:21:06.781 --> 01:21:07.614
<v Speaker 1>people at the end or the Arts Academy </v>
<v Speaker 1>have attempted to rank order American </v>

1511
01:21:11.161 --> 01:21:15.240
<v Speaker 1>universities in terms of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>allegiance to classical ideals.</v>

1512
01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:18.720
<v Speaker 1>Liking that idea of the people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment ideals or free speech free</v>

1513
01:21:18.721 --> 01:21:20.520
<v Speaker 1>discourse and the narrative social </v>
<v Speaker 1>justice,</v>

1514
01:21:20.521 --> 01:21:24.000
<v Speaker 1>and they put the University of Chicago </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the tall and I think brown was at the</v>

1515
01:21:24.001 --> 01:21:26.270
<v Speaker 1>bottom growing university or the talk.</v>

1516
01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:28.200
<v Speaker 1>If you're thinking about social justice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then</v>

1517
01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:33.860
<v Speaker 1>the question was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do I think about Canadian?</v>

1518
01:21:34.740 --> 01:21:35.573
<v Speaker 1>My answer to that would be Canadian </v>
<v Speaker 1>universities have done such a good job </v>

1519
01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:40.313
<v Speaker 1>over the over the decade standing up for</v>
<v Speaker 1>free speech that everyone just takes it </v>

1520
01:21:44.491 --> 01:21:45.324
<v Speaker 1>for granted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now it's come under threat and I </v>

1521
01:21:47.851 --> 01:21:51.570
<v Speaker 1>think it's come under threat because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>postmodern movement,</v>

1522
01:21:51.750 --> 01:21:52.583
<v Speaker 1>which basically started in the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 1>seventies in which is deeply nested </v>

1523
01:21:55.111 --> 01:21:58.530
<v Speaker 1>inside of a matrix of Marxism and </v>
<v Speaker 1>accountant.</v>

1524
01:21:58.580 --> 01:21:59.413
<v Speaker 1>The postmodernism themselves poses a </v>
<v Speaker 1>substantial threat to the very idea of </v>

1525
01:22:03.151 --> 01:22:05.550
<v Speaker 1>free speech because they don't believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>in free speech.</v>

1526
01:22:06.430 --> 01:22:08.480
<v Speaker 1>The postmodernist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to understand these.</v>

1527
01:22:08.630 --> 01:22:11.790
<v Speaker 1>The like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that every social justice</v>

1528
01:22:11.791 --> 01:22:12.624
<v Speaker 1>activist is a committed postmodernist </v>
<v Speaker 1>because most of them aren't educated </v>

1529
01:22:15.031 --> 01:22:20.031
<v Speaker 1>enough to be that</v>
<v Speaker 1>by saying,</v>

1530
01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:25.313
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes a substantial amount of </v>

1531
01:22:28.621 --> 01:22:32.310
<v Speaker 1>education before you're the incarnation </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the political philosophy,</v>

1532
01:22:32.311 --> 01:22:34.530
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to do a lot of reading and so I</v>

1533
01:22:34.531 --> 01:22:35.980
<v Speaker 1>would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1534
01:22:36.180 --> 01:22:41.180
<v Speaker 1>Michel Foucault or Jacques Derrida that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are fragmented up into their tiny little</v>

1535
01:22:41.660 --> 01:22:45.340
<v Speaker 1>book suffers no equal pieces of </v>
<v Speaker 1>voldemort soul,</v>

1536
01:22:46.790 --> 01:22:47.623
<v Speaker 1>and then they're distributed among the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are possessed by that </v>

1537
01:22:49.890 --> 01:22:50.723
<v Speaker 1>ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you take a particularly someone </v>

1538
01:22:52.651 --> 01:22:55.230
<v Speaker 1>who's hyper politically correct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd say,</v>

1539
01:22:55.231 --> 01:22:57.630
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>95 percent of them is normal person,</v>

1540
01:22:57.631 --> 01:23:00.360
<v Speaker 1>that's five percent of them is like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Michelle Foodco.</v>

1541
01:23:00.390 --> 01:23:03.480
<v Speaker 1>It's the evil offspring of Michelle Fuco</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Jacques Derrida,</v>

1542
01:23:03.820 --> 01:23:06.370
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if then if you put 20</v>

1543
01:23:06.370 --> 01:23:07.203
<v Speaker 3>of them together and their mop and you'd</v>
<v Speaker 3>get the whole philosophy blasting </v>

1544
01:23:09.911 --> 01:23:10.744
<v Speaker 3>forward,</v>
<v Speaker 3>happy.</v>

1545
01:23:11.050 --> 01:23:11.920
<v Speaker 3>Well what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's,</v>

1546
01:23:12.060 --> 01:23:15.220
<v Speaker 3>what is the philosophy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The philosophy of commodity?</v>

1547
01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:19.120
<v Speaker 3>It's quite straight forward from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>postmodernist perspective.</v>

1548
01:23:19.540 --> 01:23:23.370
<v Speaker 3>Value structures exclude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which of course they didn't,</v>

1549
01:23:24.610 --> 01:23:26.030
<v Speaker 3>but they take it further.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They say,</v>

1550
01:23:26.031 --> 01:23:26.864
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the purpose of abandoned </v>

1551
01:23:27.670 --> 01:23:28.503
<v Speaker 3>structures to explain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you're an Italian structural </v>

1552
01:23:31.030 --> 01:23:32.060
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

1553
01:23:32.061 --> 01:23:35.950
<v Speaker 3>and you have the top positions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you're privileged for doing that,</v>

1554
01:23:36.190 --> 01:23:37.023
<v Speaker 3>but the reason that that and that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight for it is because of privileges </v>

1555
01:23:40.630 --> 01:23:41.463
<v Speaker 3>you and does have a part by excluding is</v>
<v Speaker 3>that know that's pushing it a bit too </v>

1556
01:23:45.071 --> 01:23:45.904
<v Speaker 3>far.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like value structure is excluded and </v>

1557
01:23:47.721 --> 01:23:50.770
<v Speaker 3>they have because they're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>instructors if they don't exclude.</v>

1558
01:23:51.070 --> 01:23:51.903
<v Speaker 3>But to move from that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to say that the only reason value </v>

1559
01:23:54.311 --> 01:23:57.620
<v Speaker 3>instructions exist is to exclude is </v>
<v Speaker 3>palpably observed.</v>

1560
01:23:57.650 --> 01:23:58.483
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to go get your brain </v>

1561
01:23:59.351 --> 01:24:02.230
<v Speaker 3>operating on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to make it a presupposition</v>

1562
01:24:02.231 --> 01:24:03.064
<v Speaker 3>that there's a hierarchy of competence </v>
<v Speaker 3>among brain surgeons that's independent </v>

1563
01:24:06.371 --> 01:24:08.800
<v Speaker 3>of their desire for power at least </v>
<v Speaker 3>partly,</v>

1564
01:24:08.950 --> 01:24:11.620
<v Speaker 3>and you're going to look for the best </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain surgeon just like you look for the</v>

1565
01:24:11.621 --> 01:24:15.700
<v Speaker 3>best auto mechanic or or if the best </v>
<v Speaker 3>plumber for the best carpenter,</v>

1566
01:24:15.940 --> 01:24:16.773
<v Speaker 3>anything that's worth doing by by by </v>
<v Speaker 3>definition has a value structure </v>

1567
01:24:21.080 --> 01:24:21.913
<v Speaker 3>implicit in it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and of course if there are good </v>

1568
01:24:23.351 --> 01:24:24.184
<v Speaker 3>carpenters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're also people who aren't good </v>

1569
01:24:25.361 --> 01:24:26.194
<v Speaker 3>carpenters.</v>

1570
01:24:26.370 --> 01:24:30.010
<v Speaker 3>It's like prejudice to point that out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not prejudice to point that out.</v>

1571
01:24:30.070 --> 01:24:33.310
<v Speaker 3>They're just not good carpenters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Luckily they might be able to be good at</v>

1572
01:24:33.311 --> 01:24:34.144
<v Speaker 3>something out well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so most of our is that now I just </v>

1573
01:24:38.831 --> 01:24:39.664
<v Speaker 3>dropped his excluded and that's why they</v>
<v Speaker 3>exist and then what we should do is </v>

1574
01:24:43.300 --> 01:24:44.133
<v Speaker 3>flat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are limiting things or more </v>

1575
01:24:47.351 --> 01:24:49.210
<v Speaker 3>perversely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been saying we should</v>

1576
01:24:50.770 --> 01:24:54.610
<v Speaker 3>know that this is where the marks of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Marxism comes into it.</v>

1577
01:24:55.090 --> 01:25:00.090
<v Speaker 3>It's very strange,</v>
<v Speaker 3>intellectual slightly that your identity</v>

1578
01:25:00.131 --> 01:25:00.964
<v Speaker 3>is defined by your gender or your </v>
<v Speaker 3>sexuality or what ever happens to the </v>

1579
01:25:03.911 --> 01:25:04.744
<v Speaker 3>identity issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do sure and and because you're </v>

1580
01:25:06.821 --> 01:25:07.654
<v Speaker 3>identifying with that idea and other </v>
<v Speaker 3>people are identifying with other </v>

1581
01:25:10.541 --> 01:25:11.374
<v Speaker 3>identities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no way of having a dialogue </v>

1582
01:25:13.361 --> 01:25:14.194
<v Speaker 3>between them because well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the postmodernists dialogue doesn't </v>

1583
01:25:16.451 --> 01:25:19.420
<v Speaker 3>even exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way of developing a consensus</v>

1584
01:25:19.421 --> 01:25:22.210
<v Speaker 3>between groups that are predicated on </v>
<v Speaker 3>different identities.</v>

1585
01:25:22.420 --> 01:25:23.253
<v Speaker 3>The whole idea of consensus through </v>
<v Speaker 3>dialogue is actually a trick that was </v>

1586
01:25:26.561 --> 01:25:27.394
<v Speaker 3>generated by the people that you the </v>
<v Speaker 3>most dominant positions and those are </v>

1587
01:25:30.791 --> 01:25:34.640
<v Speaker 3>the fellows enter transitions that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're under always arm about.</v>

1588
01:25:35.330 --> 01:25:36.310
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>

1589
01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:39.040
<v Speaker 3>Well it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1590
01:25:39.041 --> 01:25:43.030
<v Speaker 3>it's an interesting idea because value </v>
<v Speaker 3>structures are prejudicial.</v>

1591
01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:46.420
<v Speaker 3>There's no doubt about it and one of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ways of thinking about that,</v>

1592
01:25:46.421 --> 01:25:48.620
<v Speaker 3>you think you're not prejudice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not yet.</v>

1593
01:25:49.060 --> 01:25:51.550
<v Speaker 3>You swimmed with anyone who asks you to </v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

1594
01:25:51.620 --> 01:25:52.453
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of you might say yes and ask very </v>

1595
01:25:56.021 --> 01:25:57.230
<v Speaker 3>often,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1596
01:25:57.780 --> 01:25:59.230
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I make it very,</v>

1597
01:25:59.350 --> 01:26:00.183
<v Speaker 3>very straightforward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The point here is that in our most </v>

1598
01:26:01.901 --> 01:26:04.010
<v Speaker 3>intimate relationships were precisely </v>
<v Speaker 3>most</v>

1599
01:26:04.010 --> 01:26:04.843
<v Speaker 1>prejudicial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to take that away from people </v>

1600
01:26:06.621 --> 01:26:07.454
<v Speaker 1>or do you want to start knowing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain kinds of prejudices and things </v>

1601
01:26:11.571 --> 01:26:15.580
<v Speaker 1>that are desirable or valuable or </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually being taken apart,</v>

1602
01:26:15.710 --> 01:26:20.710
<v Speaker 1>making intelligent choice so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that was a bit of time for one more</v>

1603
01:26:22.731 --> 01:26:24.720
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1604
01:26:27.860 --> 01:26:28.693
<v Speaker 1>So according to what you said earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you pointed out differences between men </v>

1605
01:26:33.351 --> 01:26:35.930
<v Speaker 1>and women</v>
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

1606
01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:41.500
<v Speaker 1>just following from what you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it stands to reason that different ideas</v>

1607
01:26:41.530 --> 01:26:45.200
<v Speaker 1>are going to resonate more with women </v>
<v Speaker 1>versus men in general.</v>

1608
01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:51.480
<v Speaker 1>So I'll give you the woman studies and </v>
<v Speaker 1>say seek help from therapists a lot more</v>

1609
01:26:51.621 --> 01:26:52.454
<v Speaker 1>than men do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which allows me to positive or negative </v>

1610
01:26:55.161 --> 01:26:59.600
<v Speaker 1>feelings you're experiencing and move </v>
<v Speaker 1>through prices a lot better than me</v>

1611
01:27:01.330 --> 01:27:03.140
<v Speaker 1>on this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another.</v>

1612
01:27:03.141 --> 01:27:08.141
<v Speaker 1>Another advantage we have generally</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump dramatic</v>

1613
01:27:10.780 --> 01:27:14.290
<v Speaker 1>sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy situations,</v>

1614
01:27:20.150 --> 01:27:20.983
<v Speaker 1>but to what extent do natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>propensities legislatively versus </v>

1615
01:27:25.570 --> 01:27:26.403
<v Speaker 1>correct?</v>

1616
01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:31.960
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely valid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just because man is less likely to.</v>

1617
01:27:34.490 --> 01:27:39.490
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't mean that that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>just because of the woman's consent.</v>

1618
01:27:40.070 --> 01:27:44.640
<v Speaker 1>Central</v>
<v Speaker 1>judge everyone.</v>

1619
01:27:46.230 --> 01:27:47.890
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very complicated question,</v>

1620
01:27:48.450 --> 01:27:49.283
<v Speaker 1>but if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you listen to the central question is </v>

1621
01:27:54.411 --> 01:27:55.244
<v Speaker 1>that given that there are differences </v>
<v Speaker 1>between men and women that say to what </v>

1622
01:28:01.220 --> 01:28:02.053
<v Speaker 1>society is structured so that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative consequences of those </v>

1623
01:28:04.761 --> 01:28:07.340
<v Speaker 1>differences might be in this specific </v>
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>

1624
01:28:07.341 --> 01:28:08.174
<v Speaker 1>it was perhaps that women are more </v>
<v Speaker 1>likely to seek medical attention and </v>

1625
01:28:12.501 --> 01:28:13.334
<v Speaker 1>psychological health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which does happen to be the case and </v>

1626
01:28:14.841 --> 01:28:15.674
<v Speaker 1>that that's perhaps beneficial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would it be better if family we're </v>

1627
01:28:18.860 --> 01:28:21.680
<v Speaker 1>more prone to seek help as well and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have called.</v>

1628
01:28:21.710 --> 01:28:22.543
<v Speaker 1>We don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we could assume that might be the </v>

1629
01:28:23.721 --> 01:28:25.390
<v Speaker 1>case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1630
01:28:26.690 --> 01:28:28.450
<v Speaker 1>let me just think about that for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>second here.</v>

1631
01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:32.450
<v Speaker 1>See if I can figure out how to answer </v>
<v Speaker 1>that properly.</v>

1632
01:28:35.870 --> 01:28:36.703
<v Speaker 1>I think the way you started this by </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out what the </v>

1633
01:28:38.391 --> 01:28:40.320
<v Speaker 1>differences are first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1634
01:28:40.350 --> 01:28:41.183
<v Speaker 1>because I always think I'm very leery of</v>
<v Speaker 1>broad scale social solutions because I </v>

1635
01:28:45.021 --> 01:28:45.854
<v Speaker 1>think there are so low resolution that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they tend to cause more trouble than </v>

1636
01:28:48.171 --> 01:28:49.004
<v Speaker 1>they than they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They tend to cause more trouble than </v>

1637
01:28:50.781 --> 01:28:51.614
<v Speaker 1>they forestall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're just at the beginning of starting </v>

1638
01:28:53.751 --> 01:28:56.750
<v Speaker 1>to understand what the differences </v>
<v Speaker 1>between men and women actually are.</v>

1639
01:28:56.870 --> 01:28:57.703
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the Scandinavian studies that I </v>

1640
01:28:58.701 --> 01:29:01.320
<v Speaker 1>talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are only about 15 years old and it</v>

1641
01:29:01.321 --> 01:29:02.070
<v Speaker 1>isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>takes about</v>

1642
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:02.903
<v Speaker 3>15 years for scientific information </v>
<v Speaker 3>generally sort of leach out into the </v>

1643
01:29:05.701 --> 01:29:06.534
<v Speaker 3>general public if it's going to do so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the question to what degree the </v>

1644
01:29:11.251 --> 01:29:15.130
<v Speaker 3>differences between men and women exist </v>
<v Speaker 3>and to what degree the biological versus</v>

1645
01:29:15.170 --> 01:29:16.003
<v Speaker 3>sociological.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something that we're just starting </v>

1646
01:29:17.131 --> 01:29:19.620
<v Speaker 3>to sort out the next question might be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1647
01:29:19.621 --> 01:29:22.770
<v Speaker 3>well what did we do in the face of those</v>
<v Speaker 3>differences?</v>

1648
01:29:23.190 --> 01:29:26.340
<v Speaker 3>And that sort of that is like I don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>know what we should do about it.</v>

1649
01:29:26.730 --> 01:29:30.030
<v Speaker 3>I do think that we should,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we should for,</v>

1650
01:29:30.060 --> 01:29:30.893
<v Speaker 3>for go the temptation to jump to </v>
<v Speaker 3>premature conclusions and we have some </v>

1651
01:29:34.411 --> 01:29:37.230
<v Speaker 3>real problems with this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So one of the things that's happening in</v>

1652
01:29:37.231 --> 01:29:38.064
<v Speaker 3>many of you may have noticed it is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>men are bailing out of the humanities </v>

1653
01:29:40.861 --> 01:29:43.080
<v Speaker 3>and social sciences like map.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1654
01:29:43.081 --> 01:29:45.210
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this has been happening for about 15</v>

1655
01:29:45.211 --> 01:29:46.200
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20 years,</v>

1656
01:29:46.260 --> 01:29:51.260
<v Speaker 3>I mean overall enrollment in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>humanities is declined substantially and</v>

1657
01:29:51.441 --> 01:29:53.250
<v Speaker 3>that's because I think most of what's </v>
<v Speaker 3>being,</v>

1658
01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:58.200
<v Speaker 3>and this is all simplified postmodern </v>
<v Speaker 3>nonsense and it's very,</v>

1659
01:29:58.201 --> 01:30:03.201
<v Speaker 3>very hard employment and go there and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they have whatever cherished assumptions</v>

1660
01:30:03.300 --> 01:30:05.610
<v Speaker 3>they might have fragmentary as they are.</v>

1661
01:30:05.670 --> 01:30:08.550
<v Speaker 3>They bring to a humanities class and </v>
<v Speaker 3>have those demolished.</v>

1662
01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:09.393
<v Speaker 3>It's like a giant hits your raft with we</v>
<v Speaker 3>have an emerging problem which is what </v>

1663
01:30:14.221 --> 01:30:17.520
<v Speaker 3>we're going to do when there's no men </v>
<v Speaker 3>left in the social sciences.</v>

1664
01:30:17.521 --> 01:30:20.860
<v Speaker 3>Is that actually going to work because </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I'm not sure of the work.</v>

1665
01:30:21.920 --> 01:30:22.753
<v Speaker 3>I guess we're gonna find out and then we</v>
<v Speaker 3>have the inverse problems say with </v>

1666
01:30:26.341 --> 01:30:27.174
<v Speaker 3>regards to engineering and women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Women don't go into engineering well </v>

1667
01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:32.130
<v Speaker 3>should it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1668
01:30:32.131 --> 01:30:35.700
<v Speaker 3>the first question might be who said </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they should come in?</v>

1669
01:30:35.701 --> 01:30:39.660
<v Speaker 3>My sense is that what we should do is </v>
<v Speaker 3>open up opportunities for people because</v>

1670
01:30:39.661 --> 01:30:40.494
<v Speaker 3>I think the idea of leveling the playing</v>
<v Speaker 3>field to the degree that's possible to </v>

1671
01:30:44.011 --> 01:30:44.844
<v Speaker 3>equalize opportunity is a good one from </v>
<v Speaker 3>a sociological perspective because you </v>

1672
01:30:47.791 --> 01:30:50.100
<v Speaker 3>don't want talent to go to waste.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1673
01:30:50.101 --> 01:30:50.934
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't mean that doesn't mean that</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way that's done commonly is </v>

1674
01:30:54.840 --> 01:30:57.640
<v Speaker 3>intelligent or appropriate because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>often doesn't work at all,</v>

1675
01:30:57.641 --> 01:30:58.474
<v Speaker 3>but it is best if we can open up society</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that people can let their talents </v>

1676
01:31:01.471 --> 01:31:02.304
<v Speaker 3>flourish.</v>

1677
01:31:02.340 --> 01:31:03.173
<v Speaker 3>I would say we remove unreasonable </v>
<v Speaker 3>prejudice to the degree that that's </v>

1678
01:31:06.390 --> 01:31:07.223
<v Speaker 3>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you do that by constraining it in </v>

1679
01:31:08.331 --> 01:31:11.690
<v Speaker 3>your own life and then you let people </v>
<v Speaker 3>make their own decisions and let us sort</v>

1680
01:31:11.700 --> 01:31:12.533
<v Speaker 3>out the way it will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know when you see that in </v>

1681
01:31:14.131 --> 01:31:17.970
<v Speaker 3>Scandinavia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you have 19 female nurses to one male</v>

1682
01:31:17.971 --> 01:31:21.570
<v Speaker 3>nurse in 19 female engineers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>female engineers,</v>

1683
01:31:21.640 --> 01:31:25.380
<v Speaker 3>or maybe that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's all we don't know.</v>

1684
01:31:25.940 --> 01:31:30.660
<v Speaker 3>I think individually people that so do </v>
<v Speaker 3>we have time for one market?</v>

1685
01:31:30.661 --> 01:31:33.460
<v Speaker 3>We should be stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we're just about to</v>

1686
01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:41.360
<v Speaker 2>thank you.</v>
