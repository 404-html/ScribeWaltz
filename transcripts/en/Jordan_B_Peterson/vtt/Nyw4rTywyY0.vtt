<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.680
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

52
00:02:56.681 --> 00:02:57.514
<v Speaker 1>and I guess I should also state that </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not a partisan or political </v>

53
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.560
<v Speaker 1>event tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

54
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.133
<v Speaker 1>we will have a question and answer </v>
<v Speaker 1>period after Dr. Peterson has made his </v>

55
00:03:10.181 --> 00:03:11.014
<v Speaker 1>presentation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know many people here know much </v>

56
00:03:16.391 --> 00:03:20.710
<v Speaker 1>about Dr. Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is widely read and,</v>

57
00:03:20.711 --> 00:03:21.544
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledgeable and in saint full on a </v>

58
00:03:24.191 --> 00:03:27.970
<v Speaker 1>great many subjects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we would like to see the questions,</v>

59
00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:29.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

60
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.150
<v Speaker 1>relevant to tonight's topic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

61
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.090
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and with that,</v>

62
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.290
<v Speaker 1>I think I'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>just start a little bit about myself.</v>

63
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.940
<v Speaker 1>Before being elected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before entering politics,</v>

64
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:47.583
<v Speaker 1>I like many other people was </v>
<v Speaker 1>increasingly getting disappointed with </v>

65
00:03:52.421 --> 00:03:53.254
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the way government was conducting </v>

66
00:03:55.721 --> 00:03:59.920
<v Speaker 1>itself with the ever increasing </v>
<v Speaker 1>government laws,</v>

67
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.173
<v Speaker 1>their rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their regulations that in my view were </v>

68
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.200
<v Speaker 1>unduly infringing on what I considered </v>
<v Speaker 1>my own personal jurisdiction,</v>

69
00:04:12.131 --> 00:04:15.970
<v Speaker 1>my own personal responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

70
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.953
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also how these increasing role of </v>

71
00:04:20.561 --> 00:04:21.394
<v Speaker 1>government was shifting and altering </v>
<v Speaker 1>society in ways that I felt </v>

72
00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:29.613
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I felt were contrary to my beliefs </v>

73
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.470
<v Speaker 1>and my values.</v>

74
00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.700
<v Speaker 1>And like most people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

75
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:41.283
<v Speaker 1>I grumbled about it and grumbled and </v>
<v Speaker 1>spoke with other people who grumbled </v>

76
00:04:45.641 --> 00:04:50.641
<v Speaker 1>about things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we didn't do very much about it.</v>

77
00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:56.130
<v Speaker 1>We just board green and bore and the the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever increasing role of government.</v>

78
00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:01.683
<v Speaker 1>But back in 2002 very fortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I came across a few other fellows who </v>

79
00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.960
<v Speaker 1>had very much same attitudes and values </v>
<v Speaker 1>as myself.</v>

80
00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.410
<v Speaker 1>And in 2002,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four of us,</v>

81
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.500
<v Speaker 1>four of us met around a kitchen table,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

82
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.730
<v Speaker 1>at Moreau and Ruth Bose home owed on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>concession for Ramsey.</v>

83
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.280
<v Speaker 1>And we decided that it was time to act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

84
00:05:33.281 --> 00:05:35.500
<v Speaker 1>none of us actually knew what that </v>
<v Speaker 1>meant.</v>

85
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:41.160
<v Speaker 1>None of us had actually ever done </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything about government,</v>

86
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:42.333
<v Speaker 1>but we knew that we needed to speak out </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we knew that we needed to make a </v>

87
00:05:47.441 --> 00:05:49.520
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we formed,</v>

88
00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:52.190
<v Speaker 1>formed a group and we called it the </v>
<v Speaker 1>land,</v>

89
00:05:52.191 --> 00:05:53.024
<v Speaker 1>our land owners association.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was asked to be the spokesperson </v>

90
00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.170
<v Speaker 1>and the president of that New </v>
<v Speaker 1>Association of four people.</v>

91
00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.880
<v Speaker 1>And then of course we said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's great.</v>

92
00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:12.990
<v Speaker 1>Now what do we do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

93
00:06:12.991 --> 00:06:16.500
<v Speaker 1>we decided to hold a meeting not far </v>
<v Speaker 1>from here.</v>

94
00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:17.641
<v Speaker 1>Indeed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

95
00:06:17.641 --> 00:06:22.110
<v Speaker 1>lab over in beckwith township was their </v>
<v Speaker 1>first meeting of the landmark landowners</v>

96
00:06:22.111 --> 00:06:25.440
<v Speaker 1>association.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We went around the area,</v>

97
00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:30.210
<v Speaker 1>we put up posters on Hydro Poles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poles and telephone poles.</v>

98
00:06:30.211 --> 00:06:35.211
<v Speaker 1>We put posters up in the general stores </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the stores around the area.</v>

99
00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:38.003
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we also send a few letters to the </v>

100
00:06:40.711 --> 00:06:42.490
<v Speaker 1>newspapers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

101
00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:48.110
<v Speaker 1>indicating what our concerns were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we wanted to see,</v>

102
00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:50.843
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we really had no idea if there </v>

103
00:06:53.341 --> 00:06:56.520
<v Speaker 1>was anybody else who thought like we </v>
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>

104
00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.073
<v Speaker 1>We knew there was a four of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we didn't know if there was any </v>

105
00:06:59.971 --> 00:07:02.850
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we held this meeting,</v>

106
00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:05.070
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>decided to give it a goal.</v>

107
00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:11.220
<v Speaker 1>And surprisingly the hall was packed in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Becker's township that night.</v>

108
00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:14.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people came,</v>

109
00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:17.700
<v Speaker 1>they shared their stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

110
00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:19.030
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

111
00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:24.240
<v Speaker 1>shared that they had similar thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>similar beliefs,</v>

112
00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.780
<v Speaker 1>similar values.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at the end of that night,</v>

113
00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:32.640
<v Speaker 1>our association of four people became an</v>
<v Speaker 1>association of 90 people.</v>

114
00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:35.153
<v Speaker 1>And within the next five years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Lennar glam donors would grow to </v>

115
00:07:39.331 --> 00:07:41.310
<v Speaker 1>include chapters from around the </v>
<v Speaker 1>province</v>

116
00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:48.140
<v Speaker 1>and a membership of 15,000 people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People found a vehicle to speak out.</v>

117
00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:52.163
<v Speaker 1>Through that association,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they found a vehicle to become involved </v>

118
00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.750
<v Speaker 1>and to make a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Excuse me.</v>

119
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:09.063
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

120
00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:12.593
<v Speaker 1>During those years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we held many town halls in every corner </v>

121
00:08:15.991 --> 00:08:16.824
<v Speaker 1>of the province.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We provided testimony at government </v>

122
00:08:20.521 --> 00:08:21.354
<v Speaker 1>committee hearings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We argued with politicians and </v>

123
00:08:24.481 --> 00:08:27.750
<v Speaker 1>bureaucrats alike in many different </v>
<v Speaker 1>forms.</v>

124
00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:32.600
<v Speaker 1>We had the Senate committee come out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

125
00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:33.663
<v Speaker 1>to murals house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wanted to hear more about our </v>

126
00:08:36.571 --> 00:08:39.210
<v Speaker 1>stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many people,</v>

127
00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:40.343
<v Speaker 1>politicians and parties asked to meet </v>
<v Speaker 1>with us and we had politicians and </v>

128
00:08:45.631 --> 00:08:46.464
<v Speaker 1>political parties knocking on our doors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeking our support and seeking our </v>

129
00:08:51.871 --> 00:08:54.360
<v Speaker 1>advice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

130
00:08:54.361 --> 00:08:58.590
<v Speaker 1>many of you will that we didn't just </v>
<v Speaker 1>confine ourselves who the two,</v>

131
00:08:58.591 --> 00:08:59.424
<v Speaker 1>the gentlemanly arts of diplomacy in </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussions with the landmark land </v>

132
00:09:02.381 --> 00:09:03.214
<v Speaker 1>owners as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On occasion we did a take activism and </v>

133
00:09:08.281 --> 00:09:09.114
<v Speaker 1>our voice to different heights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We conduct conducted skits and plays at </v>

134
00:09:13.981 --> 00:09:14.814
<v Speaker 1>farmer's markets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We shuttered and closed down government </v>

135
00:09:18.451 --> 00:09:19.284
<v Speaker 1>buildings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had a catalog action on Parliament </v>

136
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:23.423
<v Speaker 1>Hill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We held tractor rallies and closed down </v>

137
00:09:26.371 --> 00:09:28.710
<v Speaker 1>highways and bridges throughout the </v>
<v Speaker 1>province.</v>

138
00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:30.923
<v Speaker 1>We were very fortunate that we had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>great many members with a great many </v>

139
00:09:34.831 --> 00:09:35.664
<v Speaker 1>skills and also a lot of creativity and </v>
<v Speaker 1>passion for our subjects in our demand </v>

140
00:09:44.131 --> 00:09:49.131
<v Speaker 1>for greater personal responsibility and </v>
<v Speaker 1>less government involvement.</v>

141
00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:51.053
<v Speaker 1>In our property.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned many valuable lessons through </v>

142
00:09:56.281 --> 00:09:57.114
<v Speaker 1>those years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many which were quite contradictory to </v>

143
00:10:01.681 --> 00:10:02.514
<v Speaker 1>the conventional wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first lesson I learned is that we </v>

144
00:10:08.131 --> 00:10:13.020
<v Speaker 1>have a mistaken belief that political </v>
<v Speaker 1>leaders are leaders.</v>

145
00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:19.400
<v Speaker 1>It became clear to me that most </v>
<v Speaker 1>politicians are followers,</v>

146
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:21.623
<v Speaker 1>not leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that people must demonstrate and </v>

147
00:10:26.011 --> 00:10:31.011
<v Speaker 1>she'll government and politicians alike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that in order to change a policy,</v>

148
00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:34.493
<v Speaker 1>change an activity or an issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>politicians require a demonstration of </v>

149
00:10:40.591 --> 00:10:41.424
<v Speaker 1>public support.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Political parties often use polling or </v>

150
00:10:46.861 --> 00:10:50.700
<v Speaker 1>focus groups to determine where it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>safe to go.</v>

151
00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:54.810
<v Speaker 1>And when I'm speaking about politics and</v>
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>

152
00:10:55.230 --> 00:11:00.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm leaning more to the provincial and </v>
<v Speaker 1>federal side of politics as well.</v>

153
00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:03.660
<v Speaker 1>I want to make that clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Municipal politics is very much,</v>

154
00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:04.853
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a party oriented system at </v>

155
00:11:06.331 --> 00:11:11.331
<v Speaker 1>municipal level and there's a a great </v>
<v Speaker 1>many differences at the municipal level,</v>

156
00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:17.810
<v Speaker 1>but political parties use that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those focus groups and polling to try to</v>

157
00:11:20.611 --> 00:11:23.820
<v Speaker 1>determine where it's safe for them to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

158
00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:26.273
<v Speaker 1>But in doing so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really negates in diminishes that </v>

159
00:11:30.481 --> 00:11:34.590
<v Speaker 1>fundamental principle of representative </v>
<v Speaker 1>democracy,</v>

160
00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:36.503
<v Speaker 1>elected people and parties speaking with</v>
<v Speaker 1>and knowing the pulse of their </v>

161
00:11:41.941 --> 00:11:44.340
<v Speaker 1>communities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their constituents,</v>

162
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000
<v Speaker 1>their constituency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also it helping to lead and advocate</v>

163
00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:55.390
<v Speaker 1>for change for the better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In short,</v>

164
00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:01.000
<v Speaker 1>democracy does not mean to government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does not mean politicians,</v>

165
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.990
<v Speaker 1>although they are both necessary </v>
<v Speaker 1>ingredients.</v>

166
00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:10.890
<v Speaker 1>Representative democracy means you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

167
00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:13.473
<v Speaker 1>It means us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what representative democracy </v>

168
00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:18.243
<v Speaker 1>must have for it to function properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does not include the words they or </v>

169
00:12:25.001 --> 00:12:25.834
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is you and I for a representative </v>

170
00:12:29.531 --> 00:12:30.364
<v Speaker 1>democracy to work</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other lesson and I often often </v>

171
00:12:35.681 --> 00:12:39.790
<v Speaker 1>during those days with the land owners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would be approached by people.</v>

172
00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:41.523
<v Speaker 1>People would come up to me and many </v>
<v Speaker 1>venues and invariably they would say </v>

173
00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:47.320
<v Speaker 1>something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>along this line,</v>

174
00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:50.920
<v Speaker 1>someone ought to do something about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

175
00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:56.740
<v Speaker 1>Always they would come up to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say someone ought to do something,</v>

176
00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:01.780
<v Speaker 1>and that went on for quite a period of </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

177
00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:03.433
<v Speaker 1>It took me a little while to catch on </v>
<v Speaker 1>that when they were saying someone they </v>

178
00:13:07.481 --> 00:13:11.860
<v Speaker 1>met me or when they said someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it meant not them.</v>

179
00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:13.443
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

180
00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:18.940
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I did learn that,</v>

181
00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:19.913
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had listened to their suggestion and </v>

182
00:13:21.611 --> 00:13:26.080
<v Speaker 1>their idea and when they told me then </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone ought to do something,</v>

183
00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:30.010
<v Speaker 1>I would agree with them and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone ought to.</v>

184
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:33.160
<v Speaker 1>And I know where you can find that </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone.</v>

185
00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:39.420
<v Speaker 1>And they would look at me</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a questioning look and say,</v>

186
00:13:39.461 --> 00:13:40.294
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who?</v>

187
00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:42.003
<v Speaker 1>And I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look in the mirror and you will find </v>

188
00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:47.590
<v Speaker 1>that very someone that you're looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>

189
00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:49.023
<v Speaker 1>And until you do look in the mirror,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will never find that someone who </v>

190
00:13:53.561 --> 00:13:57.040
<v Speaker 1>ought to do something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was a,</v>

191
00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:58.310
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

192
00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:05.310
<v Speaker 1>it actually worked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It actually got people,</v>

193
00:14:05.831 --> 00:14:06.664
<v Speaker 1>it motivated people to actually think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about what they were saying and think </v>

194
00:14:11.921 --> 00:14:14.290
<v Speaker 1>about what they were doing and what they</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to do.</v>

195
00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:22.020
<v Speaker 1>I could go on and on about the lessons </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I learned,</v>

196
00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:27.570
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rewarding actions and activities and</v>

197
00:14:28.991 --> 00:14:32.620
<v Speaker 1>the successes that we enjoyed with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>land owners.</v>

198
00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:37.930
<v Speaker 1>But tonight I know that there's someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>who has a far broader,</v>

199
00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:43.500
<v Speaker 1>far deeper understanding and </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding of the importance of civic</v>

200
00:14:45.371 --> 00:14:48.190
<v Speaker 1>engagement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the understanding,</v>

201
00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:49.893
<v Speaker 1>and also the thoughts and knowledge of </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to help find people to find their </v>

202
00:14:56.991 --> 00:15:00.860
<v Speaker 1>voice and to become influential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tonight.</v>

203
00:15:00.861 --> 00:15:04.730
<v Speaker 1>We are honored to have that individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>here tonight.</v>

204
00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:08.870
<v Speaker 1>He is a professor of psychology at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>University of Toronto.</v>

205
00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:10.783
<v Speaker 1>He's a clinical psychologist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is bringing knowledge and insight of </v>

206
00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:17.653
<v Speaker 1>humanity to tens of thousands of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>through his online activities and is </v>

207
00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:25.870
<v Speaker 1>free university lectures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll tell you,</v>

208
00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:32.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm not one to generally watch </v>
<v Speaker 1>university lectures,</v>

209
00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:35.310
<v Speaker 1>let alone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

210
00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:36.163
<v Speaker 1>lectures on psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I started watching his lectures on </v>

211
00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:47.770
<v Speaker 1>maps of meaning and I was astonished,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

212
00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:49.383
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first one was like two and a half </v>

213
00:15:50.841 --> 00:15:51.674
<v Speaker 1>hours in length and I watched the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>five of them and I think it was the </v>

214
00:15:55.821 --> 00:16:00.380
<v Speaker 1>first five of them was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well part of it.</v>

215
00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:01.483
<v Speaker 1>It'll do over 10 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to get into all the </v>

216
00:16:04.251 --> 00:16:05.084
<v Speaker 1>details over 10 hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these lectures was 10 hours of </v>

217
00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:14.410
<v Speaker 1>breaking down in dissecting and </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding a story.</v>

218
00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:19.250
<v Speaker 1>The Story of Pinocchio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

219
00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:23.840
<v Speaker 1>I found that amazing that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I could watch these lectures first.</v>

220
00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:26.820
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

221
00:16:26.821 --> 00:16:28.260
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know about,</v>

222
00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:29.113
<v Speaker 1>I know the story of Pinocchio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't that interesting to me as a </v>

223
00:16:33.651 --> 00:16:35.200
<v Speaker 1>kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hub,</v>

224
00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:37.513
<v Speaker 1>and it certainly wouldn't have taken me </v>
<v Speaker 1>10 hours to describe the story to </v>

225
00:16:43.101 --> 00:16:46.220
<v Speaker 1>anybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>

226
00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:50.060
<v Speaker 1>so that's just an aside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to really buy something,</v>

227
00:16:50.061 --> 00:16:50.894
<v Speaker 1>I find that interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I also first came across this </v>

228
00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:58.140
<v Speaker 1>individual years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

229
00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:02.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm an avid watcher of TV,</v>
<v Speaker 1>owes a agenda with Steve Pakan,</v>

230
00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:03.753
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets into a lot of provincial policy </v>

231
00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:07.360
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

232
00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:08.690
<v Speaker 1>I find Steve Pagan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

233
00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:12.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very credible journalist and uh,</v>

234
00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:13.393
<v Speaker 1>often this fellow would be on Steve </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pagans agenda show and I would watch </v>

235
00:17:18.111 --> 00:17:19.640
<v Speaker 1>with interest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

236
00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:21.920
<v Speaker 1>when he was there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

237
00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:24.643
<v Speaker 1>but in my estimation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this gentleman is one of Canada's </v>

238
00:17:27.981 --> 00:17:32.540
<v Speaker 1>foremost thinkers and with a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>significant twist.</v>

239
00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:34.093
<v Speaker 1>He has a courage and the conviction to </v>
<v Speaker 1>speak out against some of those false </v>

240
00:17:40.611 --> 00:17:44.270
<v Speaker 1>woods of conventional wisdom and </v>
<v Speaker 1>political correctness.</v>

241
00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:49.890
<v Speaker 1>I know he has much to offer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of wisdom and</v>

242
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:54.180
<v Speaker 3>it is my pleasure to welcome to </v>
<v Speaker 3>commonplace and Dilana County,</v>

243
00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:55.890
<v Speaker 3>Dr. Jordan B.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Peterson.</v>

244
00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:58.080
<v Speaker 2>They're on this tonight.</v>

245
00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:05.740
<v Speaker 3>You can hear me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

246
00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:06.613
<v Speaker 3>here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you Mr [inaudible] for the </v>

247
00:18:09.651 --> 00:18:11.270
<v Speaker 3>introduction and also for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>invitation.</v>

248
00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:12.733
<v Speaker 3>So not everyone will invite me places.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's nice when an invitation shows </v>

249
00:18:17.421 --> 00:18:18.540
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

250
00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:21.170
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when I'm actually allowed to speak,</v>

251
00:18:21.171 --> 00:18:22.004
<v Speaker 3>that's also good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I have a habit of not preparing my </v>

252
00:18:28.371 --> 00:18:29.204
<v Speaker 3>talks until really the last minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I mean that's not exactly true </v>

253
00:18:32.391 --> 00:18:33.224
<v Speaker 3>because I've been thinking about what </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to talk to you about tonight </v>

254
00:18:35.541 --> 00:18:39.650
<v Speaker 3>for a very long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I really only got the title for this</v>

255
00:18:39.651 --> 00:18:43.370
<v Speaker 3>talk firmly in place about half an hour </v>
<v Speaker 3>ago.</v>

256
00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:44.823
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and one of the things I'd like to do </v>

257
00:18:46.461 --> 00:18:49.250
<v Speaker 3>when I'm speaking to people is to tell </v>
<v Speaker 3>them what I'm thinking about,</v>

258
00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:51.470
<v Speaker 3>not what I've already thought about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

259
00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:53.810
<v Speaker 3>and certainly not what I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what I'm thinking about,</v>

260
00:18:53.811 --> 00:18:58.130
<v Speaker 3>what I'm trying to figure out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so one of the things that's happened</v>

261
00:18:58.131 --> 00:19:00.680
<v Speaker 3>to me over the last year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhat surprisingly,</v>

262
00:19:00.681 --> 00:19:01.514
<v Speaker 3>is that I'd been invited to speak in </v>
<v Speaker 3>front of a lot of conservative groups </v>

263
00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:06.283
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

264
00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:10.550
<v Speaker 3>a lot of them were conservative groups </v>
<v Speaker 3>that were composed of young people.</v>

265
00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:12.320
<v Speaker 3>And that was interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

266
00:19:12.321 --> 00:19:13.154
<v Speaker 3>because conservatism</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't something that's necessarily all </v>

267
00:19:17.841 --> 00:19:18.674
<v Speaker 3>that easy to sell to young people </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they tend not to be that </v>

268
00:19:21.591 --> 00:19:23.550
<v Speaker 3>conservative to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

269
00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:27.500
<v Speaker 3>conservatism also tends to have quite a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot to do with things that you shouldn't</v>

270
00:19:27.501 --> 00:19:29.900
<v Speaker 3>do and instead of things that you might </v>
<v Speaker 3>be allowed to do.</v>

271
00:19:29.901 --> 00:19:31.820
<v Speaker 3>And so there's a restrictive element of </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

272
00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:35.240
<v Speaker 3>It's also perhaps less attractive to </v>
<v Speaker 3>young people then it might be,</v>

273
00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:36.403
<v Speaker 3>people do tend to get more conservative </v>
<v Speaker 3>as they get older as their personality </v>

274
00:19:38.751 --> 00:19:40.250
<v Speaker 3>shift.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

275
00:19:40.251 --> 00:19:43.880
<v Speaker 3>but what I saw was very interesting </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I saw,</v>

276
00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:46.340
<v Speaker 3>and then this was particularly true of </v>
<v Speaker 3>young men.</v>

277
00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:47.670
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

278
00:19:47.671 --> 00:19:50.270
<v Speaker 3>I haven't quite puzzled that out yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

279
00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:51.373
<v Speaker 3>I would talk about what was going on in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the universities and what I thought </v>

280
00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:56.660
<v Speaker 3>might constitute a reasonable antidote </v>
<v Speaker 3>to that.</v>

281
00:19:56.990 --> 00:20:00.470
<v Speaker 3>And that was not only in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>universities but also politically,</v>

282
00:20:00.471 --> 00:20:01.304
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that was both the adoption of </v>

283
00:20:04.101 --> 00:20:04.934
<v Speaker 3>responsibility instead of the incredible</v>
<v Speaker 3>and constant stress that's being placed </v>

284
00:20:08.721 --> 00:20:09.554
<v Speaker 3>on rights and also the responsibility of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the citizen to speak forward what he or </v>

285
00:20:14.691 --> 00:20:19.691
<v Speaker 3>she believed to be true or at least to </v>
<v Speaker 3>not speak what they knew to be false,</v>

286
00:20:20.661 --> 00:20:21.494
<v Speaker 3>which is at least a good place to start.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things I found so </v>

287
00:20:24.471 --> 00:20:27.860
<v Speaker 3>remarkable was that this was actually a </v>
<v Speaker 3>salable message to young people.</v>

288
00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:29.113
<v Speaker 3>And that surprised me because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't necessarily think that you </v>

289
00:20:32.541 --> 00:20:33.374
<v Speaker 3>would turn a lot of lights on any young </v>
<v Speaker 3>audience by talking to people about </v>

290
00:20:35.601 --> 00:20:38.230
<v Speaker 3>truth and responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think if you,</v>

291
00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:42.710
<v Speaker 3>if you went to a marketing agency and </v>
<v Speaker 3>told them that that was going to be your</v>

292
00:20:42.711 --> 00:20:43.544
<v Speaker 3>political message to young people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would tell you to go back and you </v>

293
00:20:45.821 --> 00:20:48.010
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>flesh out another plan,</v>

294
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:48.993
<v Speaker 3>sketch out another plan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But maybe young people have been talked </v>

295
00:20:51.701 --> 00:20:55.510
<v Speaker 3>to enough about rights for maybe about </v>
<v Speaker 3>the next 15 decades.</v>

296
00:20:55.511 --> 00:20:58.270
<v Speaker 3>That's what I would think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so maybe there's a hunger,</v>

297
00:20:58.271 --> 00:20:59.104
<v Speaker 3>a rising among young people for </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that has a little bit more </v>

298
00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:03.603
<v Speaker 3>respectability,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say a little bit more depth than </v>

299
00:21:05.861 --> 00:21:08.530
<v Speaker 3>the constant emphasis on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on</v>

300
00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:12.150
<v Speaker 3>doing whatever you want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whenever you want.</v>

301
00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:13.620
<v Speaker 3>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's put it that way.</v>

302
00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:16.140
<v Speaker 3>The thing about that and the thing about</v>
<v Speaker 3>rights in general,</v>

303
00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:19.890
<v Speaker 3>the idea of rights is that rights don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>really give you much direction,</v>

304
00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:20.783
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

305
00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:23.280
<v Speaker 3>they tell you what you are in principal </v>
<v Speaker 3>allowed to do,</v>

306
00:21:23.281 --> 00:21:26.430
<v Speaker 3>but they don't really tell you what you </v>
<v Speaker 3>should do and it actually turns out that</v>

307
00:21:26.431 --> 00:21:29.070
<v Speaker 3>you need to know what you should do </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you need to do something right.</v>

308
00:21:29.071 --> 00:21:33.150
<v Speaker 3>People are active and our lives don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>have any meaning without something to do</v>

309
00:21:33.151 --> 00:21:36.350
<v Speaker 3>and it and something that you should do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can't just be something that you want</v>

310
00:21:36.351 --> 00:21:39.060
<v Speaker 3>to do that's too shallow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no deep meaning.</v>

311
00:21:39.061 --> 00:21:41.520
<v Speaker 3>There's no enduring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no sustaining meaning in that.</v>

312
00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:44.820
<v Speaker 3>It's just impulsiveness and [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>And maybe that's okay.</v>

313
00:21:44.821 --> 00:21:45.654
<v Speaker 3>In some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe that's entertaining and maybe </v>

314
00:21:46.711 --> 00:21:47.544
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and maybe it's impulsively exciting and </v>

315
00:21:49.651 --> 00:21:52.650
<v Speaker 3>fun and there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some utility in that for life.</v>

316
00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:57.450
<v Speaker 3>But life is a very difficult journey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say it involves a lot of suffering</v>

317
00:21:57.451 --> 00:21:59.310
<v Speaker 3>and ill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It involves a lot of,</v>

318
00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:03.150
<v Speaker 3>of heavy existential weight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you need to be able to put something</v>

319
00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:08.480
<v Speaker 3>of value up against that so that you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>withstand your life and you can stand up</v>

320
00:22:09.031 --> 00:22:09.864
<v Speaker 3>with some dignity and you can contribute</v>
<v Speaker 3>to your community and you can feel that </v>

321
00:22:12.091 --> 00:22:14.110
<v Speaker 3>you're a worthwhile person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

322
00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:14.963
<v Speaker 3>in spite of all the things that are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're doing wrong and in spite of </v>

323
00:22:17.941 --> 00:22:18.774
<v Speaker 3>all the problems that you have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so then people need to know what </v>

324
00:22:20.821 --> 00:22:21.654
<v Speaker 3>they should do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things they should do is </v>

325
00:22:22.891 --> 00:22:23.724
<v Speaker 3>take responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And another thing they should do is try </v>

326
00:22:25.231 --> 00:22:26.064
<v Speaker 3>to tell the truth because those two </v>
<v Speaker 3>things help them live proper lives and </v>

327
00:22:29.791 --> 00:22:32.820
<v Speaker 3>then help society organize itself </v>
<v Speaker 3>properly.</v>

328
00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:34.410
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's good.</v>

329
00:22:34.411 --> 00:22:35.910
<v Speaker 3>That's good for everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

330
00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:37.433
<v Speaker 3>and so it turns out that when you tell </v>
<v Speaker 3>young people that they're pretty damn </v>

331
00:22:40.441 --> 00:22:41.274
<v Speaker 3>happy about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so one of the things I thought I </v>

332
00:22:43.021 --> 00:22:43.854
<v Speaker 3>would do tonight is talk about what </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservatives might have to offer to </v>

333
00:22:48.481 --> 00:22:51.360
<v Speaker 3>young people as a saleable message.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

334
00:22:51.361 --> 00:22:54.030
<v Speaker 3>because the other thing I've learned </v>
<v Speaker 3>over the last year,</v>

335
00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:55.073
<v Speaker 3>and this was quite</v>

336
00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:59.230
<v Speaker 3>revealing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's put it that way.</v>

337
00:22:59.370 --> 00:23:03.100
<v Speaker 3>I'll start with a brief or story just as</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little intro to this.</v>

338
00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:04.413
<v Speaker 3>In the last three weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of you may know that there was </v>

339
00:23:06.971 --> 00:23:07.804
<v Speaker 3>quite a political storm that emerged,</v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly among journalists over the </v>

340
00:23:11.411 --> 00:23:12.244
<v Speaker 3>issue of cultural appropriation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A number of journalists got in real </v>

341
00:23:15.161 --> 00:23:15.994
<v Speaker 3>trouble for transgressing the </v>
<v Speaker 3>politically correct norms in </v>

342
00:23:19.541 --> 00:23:23.360
<v Speaker 3>relationship to cultural appropriation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tremendously ill defined.</v>

343
00:23:23.361 --> 00:23:26.920
<v Speaker 3>And let's call it pathological concept.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We could start with that,</v>

344
00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:29.450
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the thing that was so interesting,</v>

345
00:23:29.451 --> 00:23:33.730
<v Speaker 3>and I think I probably talked to 10 of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Canada's top 20 journalists,</v>

346
00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:36.310
<v Speaker 3>that would be a reasonable estimate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of them in print,</v>

347
00:23:36.311 --> 00:23:37.144
<v Speaker 3>but not all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every single one of them told me that </v>

348
00:23:39.941 --> 00:23:43.150
<v Speaker 3>they were censoring themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or you think about that,</v>

349
00:23:43.151 --> 00:23:44.320
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's no joke.</v>

350
00:23:44.321 --> 00:23:46.250
<v Speaker 3>In a country like this and these people,</v>

351
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:46.791
<v Speaker 4>you'd think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

352
00:23:46.791 --> 00:23:48.500
<v Speaker 4>if anyone has power,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have power.</v>

353
00:23:48.501 --> 00:23:50.000
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well they don't really have power.</v>

354
00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:50.983
<v Speaker 4>They have competence and influence and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not the same thing as power and </v>

355
00:23:53.601 --> 00:23:54.434
<v Speaker 4>they're bloody afraid of being hung out </v>
<v Speaker 4>to dry if they say the wrong thing and </v>

356
00:23:57.021 --> 00:24:00.830
<v Speaker 4>you think about where our damn country </v>
<v Speaker 4>is when the 10 most powerful journalists</v>

357
00:24:00.831 --> 00:24:03.950
<v Speaker 4>in the country are afraid to write and </v>
<v Speaker 4>say what they think,</v>

358
00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:05.510
<v Speaker 4>that's not a good thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

359
00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:06.523
<v Speaker 4>That's not a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't care what it is that they want </v>

360
00:24:08.301 --> 00:24:11.870
<v Speaker 4>to say or think the fact that they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>not only did they tell me that they were</v>

361
00:24:11.871 --> 00:24:12.704
<v Speaker 4>censoring themselves and that they felt </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they would be hung out to dry if </v>

362
00:24:15.141 --> 00:24:15.974
<v Speaker 4>they said the wrong thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they also told me that they were </v>

363
00:24:17.331 --> 00:24:19.760
<v Speaker 4>being censored by their editors.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

364
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:20.833
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a country that has a great tradition </v>

365
00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:27.433
<v Speaker 4>and a tradition that's much longer than </v>
<v Speaker 4>this country has been around of freedom </v>

366
00:24:31.011 --> 00:24:31.844
<v Speaker 4>and free speech and free press for us to</v>
<v Speaker 4>be in a situation now where our major </v>

367
00:24:36.471 --> 00:24:37.304
<v Speaker 4>journalists are afraid that if they </v>
<v Speaker 4>misstep inappropriately in this new </v>

368
00:24:40.971 --> 00:24:44.030
<v Speaker 4>found political landmine that they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be done.</v>

369
00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:46.400
<v Speaker 4>That is not good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

370
00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:49.640
<v Speaker 4>That's a bad diagnostic sign.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

371
00:24:49.641 --> 00:24:50.474
<v Speaker 4>well I said that story was a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>intro to the other story was going to </v>

372
00:24:52.401 --> 00:24:53.450
<v Speaker 4>tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>

373
00:24:53.451 --> 00:24:58.451
<v Speaker 4>so I've been fortunate enough over the </v>
<v Speaker 4>last several months to meet,</v>

374
00:24:59.090 --> 00:24:59.923
<v Speaker 4>not the majority of the people who ran </v>
<v Speaker 4>for the leadership of the Federal </v>

375
00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:04.993
<v Speaker 4>Conservative Party,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but most of them,</v>

376
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000
<v Speaker 4>including the people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the person who Andrew,</v>

377
00:25:08.001 --> 00:25:10.190
<v Speaker 4>who recently won.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

378
00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:12.073
<v Speaker 4>they all told me the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was also interesting was that the </v>

379
00:25:14.781 --> 00:25:16.850
<v Speaker 4>conservatives were afraid to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>conservative.</v>

380
00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:17.743
<v Speaker 4>And for exactly the same reason,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were afraid that if they put </v>

381
00:25:19.761 --> 00:25:20.594
<v Speaker 4>forward valid conservative perspectives </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they would be isolated and mobbed </v>

382
00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:31.310
<v Speaker 4>and taken down and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that made them censor themselves and</v>

383
00:25:31.311 --> 00:25:33.470
<v Speaker 4>not be willing to speak up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I thought,</v>

384
00:25:33.471 --> 00:25:35.570
<v Speaker 4>and I told each of them when we </v>
<v Speaker 4>discussed this,</v>

385
00:25:35.571 --> 00:25:38.000
<v Speaker 4>the same thing was if you guys are </v>
<v Speaker 4>afraid to talk,</v>

386
00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:39.830
<v Speaker 4>you've already lost.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want as well,</v>

387
00:25:39.831 --> 00:25:42.470
<v Speaker 4>just pack up and go home.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's done.</v>

388
00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:43.700
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

389
00:25:43.701 --> 00:25:44.690
<v Speaker 4>as a psychologist</v>

390
00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:49.800
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

391
00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:53.420
<v Speaker 4>I gotta say I'm not making a case for </v>
<v Speaker 4>conservatism.</v>

392
00:25:53.421 --> 00:25:55.880
<v Speaker 4>I'm not here to make a political case.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

393
00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:56.833
<v Speaker 4>I'm here to make a philosophical and </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychological case and I think that's </v>

394
00:25:59.571 --> 00:26:02.000
<v Speaker 4>what I've been doing all along.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It has political implications.</v>

395
00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:05.360
<v Speaker 4>So I'm not saying that you should be </v>
<v Speaker 4>conservative or that conservative is the</v>

396
00:26:05.361 --> 00:26:06.194
<v Speaker 4>only way to be cause I actually don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>believe that for for a variety of </v>

397
00:26:08.601 --> 00:26:09.434
<v Speaker 4>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the reasons is that I know that </v>

398
00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:13.543
<v Speaker 4>political belief is determined in large </v>
<v Speaker 4>part by temperament and personality and </v>

399
00:26:17.151 --> 00:26:19.100
<v Speaker 4>that's very strongly biologically </v>
<v Speaker 4>influenced.</v>

400
00:26:19.101 --> 00:26:21.710
<v Speaker 4>And so conservatives tend to be lower </v>
<v Speaker 4>and openness,</v>

401
00:26:21.711 --> 00:26:22.544
<v Speaker 4>which is a trait associated with </v>
<v Speaker 4>creativity and higher in </v>

402
00:26:24.681 --> 00:26:25.514
<v Speaker 4>conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a trait associated with </v>

403
00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:27.973
<v Speaker 4>industriousness and orderliness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They tend to make good managers and </v>

404
00:26:30.231 --> 00:26:31.064
<v Speaker 4>administrators and lawyers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they tend to make good conservative </v>

405
00:26:33.261 --> 00:26:34.520
<v Speaker 4>business types.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

406
00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:36.620
<v Speaker 4>that's their forte,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's their niche.</v>

407
00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:40.190
<v Speaker 4>And that's a valid place to be in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>valid thing to be.</v>

408
00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:41.233
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>conservatives aren't so good at being </v>

409
00:26:42.591 --> 00:26:43.424
<v Speaker 4>entrepreneurial.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not so good at being artistic </v>

410
00:26:44.821 --> 00:26:46.350
<v Speaker 4>and creative.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not their niche.</v>

411
00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:50.130
<v Speaker 4>That's more the niche of the liberal end</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the spectrum as far as I'm concerned,</v>

412
00:26:50.131 --> 00:26:52.530
<v Speaker 4>for the political system to function </v>
<v Speaker 4>properly,</v>

413
00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:56.550
<v Speaker 4>you need proper representation for all </v>
<v Speaker 4>the temperamental types and they need to</v>

414
00:26:56.551 --> 00:26:58.560
<v Speaker 4>be engaged in dialogue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

415
00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:01.260
<v Speaker 4>but the thing is is that when the </v>
<v Speaker 4>conservatives are saying,</v>

416
00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:02.220
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

417
00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:06.090
<v Speaker 4>especially when they're perhaps thinking</v>
<v Speaker 4>about leading the damn party,</v>

418
00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:07.013
<v Speaker 4>let's say that they're worried about </v>
<v Speaker 4>speaking their mind in a conservative </v>

419
00:27:10.891 --> 00:27:13.170
<v Speaker 4>manner,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's just not a good thing.</v>

420
00:27:13.171 --> 00:27:14.004
<v Speaker 4>That means that something's gone wrong </v>
<v Speaker 4>with our political system and seriously </v>

421
00:27:16.291 --> 00:27:17.160
<v Speaker 4>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

422
00:27:17.161 --> 00:27:17.994
<v Speaker 4>And the other thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>another thing that I've noticed it </v>

423
00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:21.180
<v Speaker 4>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know when,</v>

424
00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:24.510
<v Speaker 4>when this all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of you may know and some of you may</v>

425
00:27:24.511 --> 00:27:26.940
<v Speaker 4>not know that I made a couple of videos </v>
<v Speaker 4>back.</v>

426
00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:27.773
<v Speaker 4>September 27th I woke up one night </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I couldn't sleep and I thought </v>

427
00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:35.040
<v Speaker 4>are usually going right if I can't sleep</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I've got something to figure out</v>

428
00:27:35.041 --> 00:27:35.874
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I've been playing with youtube </v>

429
00:27:36.421 --> 00:27:37.254
<v Speaker 4>videos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been putting my lectures online </v>

430
00:27:38.281 --> 00:27:41.880
<v Speaker 4>since 2013 and by last April they had </v>
<v Speaker 4>about a million views.</v>

431
00:27:41.881 --> 00:27:43.200
<v Speaker 4>And so I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

432
00:27:43.201 --> 00:27:45.270
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's really something man.</v>

433
00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:46.373
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you write a book and you sell a </v>

434
00:27:47.521 --> 00:27:49.770
<v Speaker 4>million copies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're one happy character.</v>

435
00:27:49.771 --> 00:27:53.400
<v Speaker 4>And I thought I had a million views is a</v>
<v Speaker 4>very large number of views.</v>

436
00:27:53.401 --> 00:27:54.234
<v Speaker 4>It really tuned me into the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 4>youtube was something completely other </v>

437
00:27:56.731 --> 00:27:58.140
<v Speaker 4>than what I thought it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But anyways,</v>

438
00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:00.090
<v Speaker 4>that night I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

439
00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:03.720
<v Speaker 4>I'll get up and make a video instead of </v>
<v Speaker 4>writing it down.</v>

440
00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:05.800
<v Speaker 4>And this was a video about bill </v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible],</v>

441
00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:08.130
<v Speaker 4>which by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Senate just passed,</v>

442
00:28:08.550 --> 00:28:11.130
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Half the Conservatives voted for it.</v>

443
00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:14.910
<v Speaker 4>Despite the fact that the justice </v>
<v Speaker 4>minister was presented with an amendment</v>

444
00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:19.050
<v Speaker 4>that clearly indicated that bill </v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] would not infringe upon free</v>

445
00:28:19.051 --> 00:28:21.600
<v Speaker 4>speech and refuse to consider the </v>
<v Speaker 4>amendment.</v>

446
00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:25.530
<v Speaker 4>So that's where we are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's compelled speech is now,</v>

447
00:28:25.531 --> 00:28:26.364
<v Speaker 4>the law in Canada isn't yet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's going to be very soon and half </v>

448
00:28:28.951 --> 00:28:31.050
<v Speaker 4>the conservatives voted for that damn </v>
<v Speaker 4>bill.</v>

449
00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:32.460
<v Speaker 4>And I can tell you to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

450
00:28:32.461 --> 00:28:34.680
<v Speaker 4>people have gone after me for being,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

451
00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:35.533
<v Speaker 4>anti-trans gender and bigoted and phobic</v>
<v Speaker 4>and all that nonsense that the left </v>

452
00:28:39.331 --> 00:28:41.520
<v Speaker 4>tends to hurl at people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not the case.</v>

453
00:28:41.521 --> 00:28:42.354
<v Speaker 4>I read that damn legislation and I read </v>
<v Speaker 4>the policies surrounding it and I know </v>

454
00:28:45.901 --> 00:28:48.930
<v Speaker 4>perfectly well that the way it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>formulated right now,</v>

455
00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:52.260
<v Speaker 4>it will do more harm to the people it </v>
<v Speaker 4>purports to protect than good.</v>

456
00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:56.100
<v Speaker 4>That'll take about 10 years to unfold.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's so incoherent.</v>

457
00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:57.300
<v Speaker 4>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

458
00:28:57.370 --> 00:28:58.203
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the principles upon which that </v>

459
00:28:59.791 --> 00:29:00.624
<v Speaker 4>legislation and its surrounding policies</v>
<v Speaker 4>are based are so paradoxical and </v>

460
00:29:03.871 --> 00:29:04.704
<v Speaker 4>contradictory that they will act </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves out because that's what </v>

461
00:29:07.351 --> 00:29:10.920
<v Speaker 4>happens with paradoxical beliefs and </v>
<v Speaker 4>tangled people up like the Matt,</v>

462
00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:15.120
<v Speaker 4>like Thai tangled people up in them like</v>
<v Speaker 4>mad.</v>

463
00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:17.400
<v Speaker 4>And we'll see that happen over the next </v>
<v Speaker 4>decade.</v>

464
00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:20.910
<v Speaker 4>And it's partly because the people who </v>
<v Speaker 4>put bill six see 16 forward,</v>

465
00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:24.270
<v Speaker 4>especially with regards to its </v>
<v Speaker 4>surrounding policies.</v>

466
00:29:24.271 --> 00:29:25.104
<v Speaker 4>The ones that are detailed out on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Ontario Human Rights Commission website </v>

467
00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:31.050
<v Speaker 4>don't give a damn about transgender </v>
<v Speaker 4>people as far as I'm concerned there.</v>

468
00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:32.033
<v Speaker 4>There's another agenda at work that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>driving their entire political force </v>

469
00:29:35.401 --> 00:29:36.234
<v Speaker 4>forward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the transgender types were just </v>

470
00:29:37.501 --> 00:29:38.790
<v Speaker 4>flavor of the month,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

471
00:29:38.791 --> 00:29:42.550
<v Speaker 4>They were poster boys for moving this </v>
<v Speaker 4>agenda forward.</v>

472
00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:45.910
<v Speaker 4>And so the fact that the legislation </v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't going to do them any good,</v>

473
00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:47.763
<v Speaker 4>you're the transgendered people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>any good isn't going to stop the people </v>

474
00:29:49.601 --> 00:29:52.090
<v Speaker 4>who put the legislation forward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So anyways,</v>

475
00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:57.930
<v Speaker 4>I made these videos and I put them on a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on youtube and well,</v>

476
00:29:58.091 --> 00:30:01.840
<v Speaker 4>to say that they caused a storm is </v>
<v Speaker 4>somewhat of an understatement.</v>

477
00:30:01.841 --> 00:30:02.680
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just been,</v>

478
00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:03.580
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

479
00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:04.453
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know what to think about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's completely an absolutely surreal </v>

480
00:30:08.231 --> 00:30:09.670
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's happened to me.</v>

481
00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:10.540
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>

482
00:30:10.541 --> 00:30:12.010
<v Speaker 4>And as a consequence of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

483
00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:14.410
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how many people have </v>
<v Speaker 4>watched those original videos,</v>

484
00:30:14.411 --> 00:30:15.244
<v Speaker 4>like 350,000 and I think now about 50 </v>
<v Speaker 4>million people have watched videos </v>

485
00:30:20.021 --> 00:30:23.080
<v Speaker 4>associated with this sequence of events </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I'm describing,</v>

486
00:30:23.081 --> 00:30:23.914
<v Speaker 4>which is just 350,000 people watched the</v>
<v Speaker 4>testimony that I gave before the Senate </v>

487
00:30:29.531 --> 00:30:32.800
<v Speaker 4>on bill [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 4>You bloody well know that the apocalypse</v>

488
00:30:32.801 --> 00:30:37.801
<v Speaker 4>is close when 350,000 people around the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world watch a Canadian Senate hearing.</v>

489
00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:40.660
<v Speaker 4>So I really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

490
00:30:40.661 --> 00:30:42.340
<v Speaker 4>really what's going on man?</v>

491
00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:47.290
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

492
00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:49.650
<v Speaker 4>so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

493
00:30:49.651 --> 00:30:50.484
<v Speaker 4>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said well the journalists are nervous </v>

494
00:30:52.081 --> 00:30:55.950
<v Speaker 4>in the and the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the conservatives are nervous and,</v>

495
00:30:56.370 --> 00:30:58.260
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well then you know,</v>

496
00:30:58.261 --> 00:30:59.094
<v Speaker 4>when I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I put myself out in and made these </v>

497
00:31:01.201 --> 00:31:02.034
<v Speaker 4>videos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which are really didn't expect to </v>

498
00:31:03.151 --> 00:31:03.984
<v Speaker 4>attract much attention at all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just assumed that I was going to </v>

499
00:31:05.401 --> 00:31:07.350
<v Speaker 4>clarify what I was thinking a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

500
00:31:07.351 --> 00:31:08.184
<v Speaker 4>and see what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I kind of a curious person now that'll </v>

501
00:31:10.201 --> 00:31:13.170
<v Speaker 4>teach me but I'm kind of a curious </v>
<v Speaker 4>person.</v>

502
00:31:13.171 --> 00:31:14.790
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

503
00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:15.773
<v Speaker 4>but then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I also experienced firsthand what </v>

504
00:31:17.191 --> 00:31:19.680
<v Speaker 4>happens when you do something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now Watch,</v>

505
00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:21.300
<v Speaker 4>I got nailed right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It got,</v>

506
00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:22.253
<v Speaker 4>especially for about three months,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things were pretty up in the air at the </v>

507
00:31:24.481 --> 00:31:26.440
<v Speaker 4>university sent me two letters telling </v>
<v Speaker 4>me that it,</v>

508
00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:29.820
<v Speaker 4>it was so funny cause I remember I made </v>
<v Speaker 4>this video and I said,</v>

509
00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:31.830
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>under this new legislation,</v>

510
00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:35.490
<v Speaker 4>making this video,</v>
<v Speaker 4>criticizing this legislation is probably</v>

511
00:31:35.491 --> 00:31:36.324
<v Speaker 4>illegal.</v>

512
00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:37.313
<v Speaker 4>And so then the unit and people of </v>
<v Speaker 4>course reacted to me as if I was </v>

513
00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:41.550
<v Speaker 4>scaremongering,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which by the way,</v>

514
00:31:41.551 --> 00:31:42.384
<v Speaker 4>was the right response.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you hear someone in a stable </v>

515
00:31:43.981 --> 00:31:46.380
<v Speaker 4>society stand up and say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>excuse me,</v>

516
00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:47.693
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's something rotten at the base </v>

517
00:31:49.081 --> 00:31:49.914
<v Speaker 4>here and it's affecting the manner in </v>
<v Speaker 4>which the legislation that our country </v>

518
00:31:52.441 --> 00:31:53.520
<v Speaker 4>is producing is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

519
00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:56.880
<v Speaker 4>is being rolled fourth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they say that you should think that</v>

520
00:31:56.881 --> 00:32:00.510
<v Speaker 4>person is probably a charlotte and has </v>
<v Speaker 4>something wrong with them because look,</v>

521
00:32:00.511 --> 00:32:03.000
<v Speaker 4>the culture works pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The country has worked really well for a</v>

522
00:32:03.001 --> 00:32:03.834
<v Speaker 4>long period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the logical initial response </v>

523
00:32:05.971 --> 00:32:07.020
<v Speaker 4>should be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

524
00:32:07.021 --> 00:32:07.854
<v Speaker 4>you think there's a fundamental problem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why shouldn't we just assume that </v>

525
00:32:09.631 --> 00:32:10.464
<v Speaker 4>there's a fundamental problem with you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And one of the ways that you determine </v>

526
00:32:13.741 --> 00:32:14.574
<v Speaker 4>that is you throw things out the person </v>
<v Speaker 4>metaphorically and see if any of them </v>

527
00:32:17.791 --> 00:32:18.660
<v Speaker 4>stick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

528
00:32:18.661 --> 00:32:19.411
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

529
00:32:19.411 --> 00:32:23.310
<v Speaker 4>I was a big get to know homophobic and </v>
<v Speaker 4>transphobic and a racist.</v>

530
00:32:23.311 --> 00:32:24.144
<v Speaker 4>That one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know where the hell that one </v>

531
00:32:24.631 --> 00:32:26.280
<v Speaker 4>came from.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was because I,</v>

532
00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:28.700
<v Speaker 4>I criticized the two.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

533
00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:32.820
<v Speaker 4>what would you call reprehensible women </v>
<v Speaker 4>who started black lives,</v>

534
00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:34.530
<v Speaker 4>the black lives matter movement,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Toronto.</v>

535
00:32:34.531 --> 00:32:35.364
<v Speaker 4>It isn't because they're black.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's because the reprehensible black or </v>

536
00:32:37.591 --> 00:32:38.660
<v Speaker 4>white man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're,</v>

537
00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:40.393
<v Speaker 4>you're reprehensible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's sort of the definition of not </v>

538
00:32:42.471 --> 00:32:43.640
<v Speaker 4>being racist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

539
00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:44.953
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

540
00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:53.340
<v Speaker 4>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

541
00:32:53.341 --> 00:32:56.850
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so there were a couple of demonstrations</v>

542
00:32:56.851 --> 00:32:59.070
<v Speaker 4>and then the press jumped on me to some </v>
<v Speaker 4>degree.</v>

543
00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:01.020
<v Speaker 4>They didn't do too bad a job I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>think.</v>

544
00:33:01.530 --> 00:33:05.280
<v Speaker 4>And then the university thankfully wrote</v>
<v Speaker 4>two letters saying that what I was doing</v>

545
00:33:05.281 --> 00:33:08.010
<v Speaker 4>was probably illegal and that it </v>
<v Speaker 4>violated the,</v>

546
00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:08.933
<v Speaker 4>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ontario Human Rights Commission's </v>

547
00:33:10.351 --> 00:33:11.184
<v Speaker 4>policies and probably the university's </v>
<v Speaker 4>policies as well as far as they were </v>

548
00:33:13.951 --> 00:33:15.690
<v Speaker 4>concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which really wasn't the case.</v>

549
00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:17.970
<v Speaker 4>And the letters also contained a number </v>
<v Speaker 4>of untruths,</v>

550
00:33:17.971 --> 00:33:20.880
<v Speaker 4>which I detailed because I read them on </v>
<v Speaker 4>Youtube too,</v>

551
00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:23.400
<v Speaker 4>which is actually quite helpful and </v>
<v Speaker 4>handy that,</v>

552
00:33:23.730 --> 00:33:24.563
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if someone writes me a letter that </v>

553
00:33:26.970 --> 00:33:30.270
<v Speaker 4>purports to lay out a set of facts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then I can just read it.</v>

554
00:33:30.271 --> 00:33:31.104
<v Speaker 4>I don't even have to comment on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can read it and let people make up </v>

555
00:33:32.911 --> 00:33:35.280
<v Speaker 4>their own minds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which they did so,</v>

556
00:33:36.150 --> 00:33:37.140
<v Speaker 4>so well.</v>

557
00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:37.973
<v Speaker 4>And so my job was in del in in doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the fact that the university went </v>

558
00:33:42.151 --> 00:33:44.190
<v Speaker 4>after me actually turned out to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>extremely helpful.</v>

559
00:33:44.191 --> 00:33:45.600
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because I had said,</v>

560
00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:46.583
<v Speaker 4>look under the provisions of this new </v>
<v Speaker 4>legislation and legislation like this </v>

561
00:33:50.041 --> 00:33:54.330
<v Speaker 4>that's already in place in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what I am doing criticizing this bill is</v>

562
00:33:54.331 --> 00:33:56.190
<v Speaker 4>probably illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And everyone said,</v>

563
00:33:56.191 --> 00:33:57.210
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're crazy.</v>

564
00:33:57.211 --> 00:33:58.560
<v Speaker 4>You know you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's something wrong with you.</v>

565
00:33:58.561 --> 00:33:59.460
<v Speaker 4>You're off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're a,</v>

566
00:33:59.550 --> 00:34:02.250
<v Speaker 4>you're a scaremonger on a rabble rouser </v>
<v Speaker 4>and all of that.</v>

567
00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:05.930
<v Speaker 4>And then the university wrote a letter </v>
<v Speaker 4>saying what you did violate it,</v>

568
00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:07.473
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the university policy and probably the </v>

569
00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:11.580
<v Speaker 4>Ontario Human Rights Commission's </v>
<v Speaker 4>policies and the law.</v>

570
00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:12.510
<v Speaker 4>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>great,</v>

571
00:34:12.690 --> 00:34:13.523
<v Speaker 4>you had your lawyers take a look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't have asked for a more </v>

572
00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:16.473
<v Speaker 4>stronger statement,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a stronger statement in support of what </v>

573
00:34:19.321 --> 00:34:20.154
<v Speaker 4>I had said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially because it certainly wasn't </v>

574
00:34:21.421 --> 00:34:23.010
<v Speaker 4>written in support of what I had said.</v>

575
00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:24.203
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then the journalists started to pay </v>

576
00:34:24.901 --> 00:34:28.290
<v Speaker 4>attention to what I had actually looked </v>
<v Speaker 4>at and they read it and they thought,</v>

577
00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:29.380
<v Speaker 4>Oh hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at that,</v>

578
00:34:29.381 --> 00:34:30.214
<v Speaker 4>that aren't dead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ontario Human Rights Commission website </v>

579
00:34:32.281 --> 00:34:35.670
<v Speaker 4>policy mass is actually quite a nest of </v>
<v Speaker 4>spiders just like he said.</v>

580
00:34:36.150 --> 00:34:39.630
<v Speaker 4>And so it turns out that there is </v>
<v Speaker 4>something rotten in the state of Denmark</v>

581
00:34:39.631 --> 00:34:42.870
<v Speaker 4>and that's just not so good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so like this is a good country man.</v>

582
00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:43.883
<v Speaker 4>That's why people want to come here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's one of the best countries in the </v>

583
00:34:45.811 --> 00:34:46.644
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's the best country in the </v>

584
00:34:48.511 --> 00:34:49.051
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

585
00:34:49.051 --> 00:34:50.940
<v Speaker 4>we don't want to get too high on her </v>
<v Speaker 4>horse about that.</v>

586
00:34:50.941 --> 00:34:52.710
<v Speaker 4>And God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>aren't we fortunate,</v>

587
00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:54.990
<v Speaker 4>but it's a pretty good place,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

588
00:34:55.110 --> 00:34:55.943
<v Speaker 4>But it's not what it used to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the people who are running it are </v>

589
00:34:58.621 --> 00:35:01.470
<v Speaker 4>not who you think they are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So for example,</v>

590
00:35:01.650 --> 00:35:02.483
<v Speaker 4>provincially,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's take it the title that the people </v>

591
00:35:05.971 --> 00:35:09.030
<v Speaker 4>who follow Kathleen Wynne have is </v>
<v Speaker 4>liberal.</v>

592
00:35:09.090 --> 00:35:09.923
<v Speaker 4>They are not liberals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they are radicals and they're radicals </v>

593
00:35:12.691 --> 00:35:13.524
<v Speaker 4>of a sword.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I used to work for the NDP when I was a </v>

594
00:35:14.671 --> 00:35:15.504
<v Speaker 4>kid back in the 70s and the people who </v>
<v Speaker 4>are influential in Kathleen wins </v>

595
00:35:19.651 --> 00:35:20.484
<v Speaker 4>government and who are making the sort </v>
<v Speaker 4>of policies that I regard is </v>

596
00:35:22.471 --> 00:35:23.304
<v Speaker 4>particularly reprehensible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are the kind of radical leftists that </v>

597
00:35:26.251 --> 00:35:31.251
<v Speaker 4>the NDP working class socialists that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>knew in the 1970s would have regarded as</v>

598
00:35:32.041 --> 00:35:32.874
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as the unacceptable fringe of the </v>

599
00:35:35.850 --> 00:35:37.410
<v Speaker 4>Socialist Party.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they're now defunct.</v>

600
00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:40.110
<v Speaker 4>They have now defined themselves as </v>
<v Speaker 4>centrist liberals.</v>

601
00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:41.123
<v Speaker 4>They are not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and what they're doing is not centrist </v>

602
00:35:43.471 --> 00:35:44.304
<v Speaker 4>and it's not liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that's another thing for the </v>

603
00:35:45.931 --> 00:35:46.764
<v Speaker 4>conservative party to start thinking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about because you have a whole bunch of </v>

604
00:35:49.291 --> 00:35:50.124
<v Speaker 4>liberals you could go out there and </v>
<v Speaker 4>capture because they've been abandoned </v>

605
00:35:52.771 --> 00:35:54.720
<v Speaker 4>by their own party.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's for sure.</v>

606
00:35:54.721 --> 00:35:55.554
<v Speaker 4>And it's something that should be taken </v>
<v Speaker 4>advantage of because well we need some </v>

607
00:35:58.111 --> 00:35:58.944
<v Speaker 4>conservatives and we need some </v>
<v Speaker 4>socialists and maybe we need some </v>

608
00:36:01.111 --> 00:36:01.944
<v Speaker 4>liberals and the Liberals and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Conservatives are getting damn scarce </v>

609
00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:09.510
<v Speaker 4>among the people who actually make </v>
<v Speaker 4>policy at not only at the provincial and</v>

610
00:36:09.511 --> 00:36:11.220
<v Speaker 4>federal level but also at mid level.</v>

611
00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:14.790
<v Speaker 4>Admitted at the top end of mid level </v>
<v Speaker 4>administration is everywhere as well and</v>

612
00:36:14.791 --> 00:36:15.624
<v Speaker 4>that's not accidental.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's partly because unbeknownst to the </v>

613
00:36:18.541 --> 00:36:20.760
<v Speaker 4>majority of society for the last 30 </v>
<v Speaker 4>years,</v>

614
00:36:20.761 --> 00:36:21.594
<v Speaker 4>the damn universities have been doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing but training and targeted </v>

615
00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:26.453
<v Speaker 4>training,</v>
<v Speaker 4>radical leftist activists and if you </v>

616
00:36:29.911 --> 00:36:30.744
<v Speaker 4>don't believe that you just go on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>web and look up like 10 women's studies </v>

617
00:36:34.591 --> 00:36:38.430
<v Speaker 4>programs and read what they say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to listen to me.</v>

618
00:36:38.431 --> 00:36:40.380
<v Speaker 4>You don't have it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want you to believe me.</v>

619
00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:43.110
<v Speaker 4>You just go out there and find it for </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself.</v>

620
00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:47.190
<v Speaker 4>And there the activism is devoted to a </v>
<v Speaker 4>certain key set of ends and one of them,</v>

621
00:36:47.191 --> 00:36:48.900
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's a word to remember.</v>

622
00:36:49.050 --> 00:36:50.640
<v Speaker 4>Equity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

623
00:36:50.850 --> 00:36:53.190
<v Speaker 4>that's replaced equality of opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

624
00:36:53.191 --> 00:36:54.630
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>equality of opportunity.</v>

625
00:36:54.631 --> 00:36:57.210
<v Speaker 4>That's a tough one to bring about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

626
00:36:57.330 --> 00:36:58.163
<v Speaker 4>you need a fair bit of government </v>
<v Speaker 4>intervention to bring about equality of </v>

627
00:37:00.241 --> 00:37:01.040
<v Speaker 4>opportunity.</v>

628
00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:03.480
<v Speaker 4>It's maybe it's a noble goal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a tough one to attain.</v>

629
00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:04.463
<v Speaker 4>But equity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>equity means equality of outcome and </v>

630
00:37:07.561 --> 00:37:10.680
<v Speaker 4>you're seeing equity everywhere and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what it means.</v>

631
00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:11.843
<v Speaker 4>And so the people who are pushing this </v>
<v Speaker 4>radical agenda are pushing things that </v>

632
00:37:16.411 --> 00:37:17.244
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that are inimicable to our traditions </v>

633
00:37:20.641 --> 00:37:22.740
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and practices of governance.</v>

634
00:37:22.741 --> 00:37:25.830
<v Speaker 4>You know the Ontario social justice </v>
<v Speaker 4>tribunals,</v>

635
00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:28.890
<v Speaker 4>because we have social justice tribunals</v>
<v Speaker 4>in Ontario,</v>

636
00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:31.200
<v Speaker 4>they don't even day now to hide the damn</v>
<v Speaker 4>name.</v>

637
00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:32.213
<v Speaker 4>The social justice tribunals are allowed</v>
<v Speaker 4>to suspend standard jurisprudential </v>

638
00:37:37.171 --> 00:37:41.550
<v Speaker 4>practice in the pursuit of their aims.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It says that right in their policies.</v>

639
00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:45.540
<v Speaker 4>Well you think about that re really </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's written in your policies.</v>

640
00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:49.110
<v Speaker 4>You can just dispense with classic </v>
<v Speaker 4>jurisprudential tradition.</v>

641
00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:50.033
<v Speaker 4>So what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It means you can do any damn thing you </v>

642
00:37:51.751 --> 00:37:54.420
<v Speaker 4>want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so those are the sorts of,</v>

643
00:37:54.450 --> 00:37:59.070
<v Speaker 4>I would say subversive and fifth column </v>
<v Speaker 4>like organizations that are sprouting up</v>

644
00:37:59.071 --> 00:38:02.220
<v Speaker 4>in our society everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not a good thing.</v>

645
00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:03.353
<v Speaker 4>And so look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when someone stands up and says there's </v>

646
00:38:05.941 --> 00:38:06.774
<v Speaker 4>something wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the first thing you should ask is what </v>

647
00:38:08.791 --> 00:38:09.624
<v Speaker 4>makes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why should I assume that you know what </v>

648
00:38:11.371 --> 00:38:13.650
<v Speaker 4>the hell you're talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a good question.</v>

649
00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:14.693
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

650
00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:20.640
<v Speaker 4>you investigate it and you find out </v>
<v Speaker 4>whether or not the person does know what</v>

651
00:38:20.641 --> 00:38:21.474
<v Speaker 4>they're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And on the issue that I'm describing to </v>

652
00:38:23.521 --> 00:38:25.560
<v Speaker 4>you tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as far as I can tell,</v>

653
00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:26.513
<v Speaker 4>I know what I'm talking about now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People have been on my case about this </v>

654
00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:30.743
<v Speaker 4>in a very serious way for quite a long </v>
<v Speaker 4>time and so far they haven't made any </v>

655
00:38:34.411 --> 00:38:38.710
<v Speaker 4>inroads into arguments and most of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>time they're too damn cowardly to debate</v>

656
00:38:38.711 --> 00:38:39.544
<v Speaker 4>me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is also something that's really </v>

657
00:38:40.121 --> 00:38:42.940
<v Speaker 4>interesting because I put out public </v>
<v Speaker 4>calls constantly.</v>

658
00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:45.460
<v Speaker 4>It's you want to debate about gender and</v>
<v Speaker 4>sex.</v>

659
00:38:45.461 --> 00:38:48.040
<v Speaker 4>You just bring it on because that </v>
<v Speaker 4>happens to me,</v>

660
00:38:48.041 --> 00:38:52.030
<v Speaker 4>happens to be an area of expertise for </v>
<v Speaker 4>me and I know the damn literature and if</v>

661
00:38:52.031 --> 00:38:56.170
<v Speaker 4>you want to come out and make your case </v>
<v Speaker 4>that all the differences between men and</v>

662
00:38:56.171 --> 00:38:57.004
<v Speaker 4>women are socially constructed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>culturally constructed or that there's </v>

663
00:39:00.371 --> 00:39:02.800
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or that they're just a personal whim,</v>

664
00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:03.783
<v Speaker 4>which by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's exactly what's written into the </v>

665
00:39:05.141 --> 00:39:07.060
<v Speaker 4>policies surrounding bill [inaudible].</v>

666
00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:08.073
<v Speaker 4>Then you come out and make that case </v>
<v Speaker 4>publicly and see how well it stands up </v>

667
00:39:11.050 --> 00:39:11.883
<v Speaker 4>and I know how well it'll stand up </v>
<v Speaker 4>because that kind of thinking was </v>

668
00:39:14.321 --> 00:39:15.154
<v Speaker 4>defeated in the scientific realm back in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the 1960s in the universities and what </v>

669
00:39:19.841 --> 00:39:24.280
<v Speaker 4>that meant was that the radicals who </v>
<v Speaker 4>want it to keep promoting precisely that</v>

670
00:39:24.281 --> 00:39:27.970
<v Speaker 4>kind of view just circumvented the </v>
<v Speaker 4>entire scientific process and started to</v>

671
00:39:27.971 --> 00:39:30.880
<v Speaker 4>implement their demands for their </v>
<v Speaker 4>particular viewpoint.</v>

672
00:39:31.090 --> 00:39:31.923
<v Speaker 4>From a practical policy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>administrative and legislative </v>

673
00:39:34.301 --> 00:39:35.134
<v Speaker 4>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 4>knowing full well that they had lost </v>

674
00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:40.510
<v Speaker 4>100% on the empirical and the scientific</v>
<v Speaker 4>front,</v>

675
00:39:40.690 --> 00:39:41.523
<v Speaker 4>and now what they do instead is </v>
<v Speaker 4>criticized the scientific endeavor </v>

676
00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:45.093
<v Speaker 4>itself because it failed to produce the </v>
<v Speaker 4>results that they assumed would be the </v>

677
00:39:47.861 --> 00:39:48.694
<v Speaker 4>case.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's plenty that's rotten in the </v>

678
00:39:52.091 --> 00:39:52.924
<v Speaker 4>state of Denmark and I'm embarrassed to </v>
<v Speaker 4>state that a tremendous amount of that </v>

679
00:39:55.810 --> 00:39:58.480
<v Speaker 4>stems from the universities and they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>in bad shape.</v>

680
00:39:58.750 --> 00:40:02.680
<v Speaker 4>Do not send your children to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>humanities,</v>

681
00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:04.480
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're corrupt.</v>

682
00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:05.493
<v Speaker 4>They will.</v>

683
00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:12.993
<v Speaker 4>They won't learn to think because the </v>
<v Speaker 4>postmodernists don't believe in </v>

684
00:40:15.641 --> 00:40:16.474
<v Speaker 4>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They won't learn logic because the </v>

685
00:40:17.621 --> 00:40:18.454
<v Speaker 4>postmodernist believe that logic is one </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the tools that the oppressive </v>

686
00:40:21.131 --> 00:40:25.000
<v Speaker 4>patriarchy uses to sustain its </v>
<v Speaker 4>oppressive patriarchy</v>

687
00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:30.550
<v Speaker 4>or oppressive patriarchal nature.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They won't learn to write well.</v>

688
00:40:30.551 --> 00:40:31.384
<v Speaker 4>That's because writing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>teaching people to write takes a </v>

689
00:40:32.621 --> 00:40:33.454
<v Speaker 4>tremendous amount of effort and perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not so much interested in </v>

690
00:40:36.010 --> 00:40:40.510
<v Speaker 4>teaching people to formulate their own </v>
<v Speaker 4>thoughts precisely and carefully as they</v>

691
00:40:40.511 --> 00:40:41.344
<v Speaker 4>are interested in producing cult like </v>
<v Speaker 4>clones to go out and do their activist </v>

692
00:40:45.581 --> 00:40:46.414
<v Speaker 4>work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is precisely what they stayed on </v>

693
00:40:47.411 --> 00:40:48.310
<v Speaker 4>their websites.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

694
00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:50.980
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things are not so pretty and,</v>

695
00:40:50.981 --> 00:40:51.814
<v Speaker 4>and it's very embarrassing as a member </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the academy and to come before a </v>

696
00:40:55.931 --> 00:40:57.130
<v Speaker 4>group of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

697
00:40:57.131 --> 00:40:57.964
<v Speaker 4>of public citizens and say you've been </v>
<v Speaker 4>betrayed by your institutions of higher </v>

698
00:41:01.901 --> 00:41:03.460
<v Speaker 4>learning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's sad,</v>

699
00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:05.740
<v Speaker 4>it's sad and it's not good.</v>

700
00:41:05.950 --> 00:41:06.731
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you think,</v>

701
00:41:06.731 --> 00:41:08.860
<v Speaker 4>well it's just the university,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just an ivory tower.</v>

702
00:41:08.861 --> 00:41:10.390
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>think again man.</v>

703
00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:13.930
<v Speaker 4>What happens in the universities happens</v>
<v Speaker 4>everywhere five years later.</v>

704
00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:18.460
<v Speaker 4>So it's no mere ivory tower issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

705
00:41:18.730 --> 00:41:21.700
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So a couple of weeks ago,</v>

706
00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:22.593
<v Speaker 4>a couple of months ago I did this </v>
<v Speaker 4>lecture and Vancouver called the left </v>

707
00:41:26.131 --> 00:41:26.964
<v Speaker 4>wing case for free speech because you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can actually make a left wing case for </v>

708
00:41:29.741 --> 00:41:31.090
<v Speaker 4>free speech pretty easily.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

709
00:41:31.091 --> 00:41:31.924
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously some people have more </v>

710
00:41:33.951 --> 00:41:34.784
<v Speaker 4>influence in authority than others and </v>
<v Speaker 4>just as obviously it's harder for the </v>

711
00:41:37.851 --> 00:41:40.910
<v Speaker 4>people with less influence and authority</v>
<v Speaker 4>to make their case known.</v>

712
00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:43.490
<v Speaker 4>So clearly they need to be able to make </v>
<v Speaker 4>their case.</v>

713
00:41:43.610 --> 00:41:45.860
<v Speaker 4>So that's the left wing case for free </v>
<v Speaker 4>speech.</v>

714
00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:46.843
<v Speaker 4>It's fairly straight forward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought it needed to be made because </v>

715
00:41:49.370 --> 00:41:50.203
<v Speaker 4>especially on the radical left,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people seem to have forgotten that free </v>

716
00:41:52.791 --> 00:41:53.930
<v Speaker 4>speech was actually there.</v>

717
00:41:54.110 --> 00:41:59.110
<v Speaker 4>Most what welcome friend and and enabled</v>
<v Speaker 4>them to do whatever good things they did</v>

718
00:42:00.051 --> 00:42:02.060
<v Speaker 4>manage to do over the last hundred </v>
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>

719
00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:06.320
<v Speaker 4>But I made a left wing case and so that </v>
<v Speaker 4>was easy and reasonably entertaining and</v>

720
00:42:06.321 --> 00:42:07.940
<v Speaker 4>you can watch that on youtube if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>want.</v>

721
00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:09.223
<v Speaker 4>And so tonight what I thought I'd do as </v>
<v Speaker 4>a counterpart to that is lay out what I </v>

722
00:42:12.501 --> 00:42:16.910
<v Speaker 4>believe might be some tenants for a </v>
<v Speaker 4>viable 21st century conservatism.</v>

723
00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:18.590
<v Speaker 4>And these are ideas that I'm playing </v>
<v Speaker 4>with.</v>

724
00:42:18.591 --> 00:42:20.630
<v Speaker 4>So I'm going to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wrote down about 12 of them.</v>

725
00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:22.640
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if we'll get through all of</v>
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>

726
00:42:22.641 --> 00:42:25.940
<v Speaker 4>but we can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can start with a few and this is what</v>

727
00:42:25.941 --> 00:42:28.790
<v Speaker 4>the Conservatives could be selling to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the public.</v>

728
00:42:29.090 --> 00:42:29.923
<v Speaker 4>Now what seems to me to be happening </v>
<v Speaker 4>instead at the moment is as Kathleen </v>

729
00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:35.690
<v Speaker 4>Wynne flames out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not nearly fast enough in my opinion.</v>

730
00:42:35.691 --> 00:42:36.524
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

731
00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:43.733
<v Speaker 4>The attitude among conservatives that </v>
<v Speaker 4>the provincial party seems to be </v>

732
00:42:45.751 --> 00:42:47.580
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well let's just go like go,</v>

733
00:42:47.581 --> 00:42:51.420
<v Speaker 4>let's go cluster in a corner and not do </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything too stupid because maybe she'll</v>

734
00:42:51.421 --> 00:42:52.254
<v Speaker 4>burn yourself out so badly that we'll </v>
<v Speaker 4>just win the next election and we won't </v>

735
00:42:54.211 --> 00:42:55.100
<v Speaker 4>have to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

736
00:42:55.110 --> 00:42:58.500
<v Speaker 4>do anything that will put us at risk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm not being cynical about that.</v>

737
00:42:58.501 --> 00:43:01.470
<v Speaker 4>I can understand the utility of that </v>
<v Speaker 4>policy.</v>

738
00:43:01.471 --> 00:43:02.304
<v Speaker 4>Although I think it's a bad policy and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>think it's a bad policy because there </v>

739
00:43:05.641 --> 00:43:06.474
<v Speaker 4>are some things that seriously need to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be said about Kathleen Wynne and her </v>

740
00:43:08.971 --> 00:43:09.804
<v Speaker 4>government.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I could tell you one noble aim for </v>

741
00:43:12.091 --> 00:43:12.924
<v Speaker 4>the provincial conservatives for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>next election would be to decimate the </v>

742
00:43:16.831 --> 00:43:19.740
<v Speaker 4>provincial liberals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not One should be left.</v>

743
00:43:19.741 --> 00:43:21.450
<v Speaker 4>What's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's your popularity at right now?</v>

744
00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:24.900
<v Speaker 4>Under 10% if she had a shred of </v>
<v Speaker 4>integrity,</v>

745
00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:26.310
<v Speaker 4>she would already resigned.</v>

746
00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:29.640
<v Speaker 4>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is a goal for the conservatives,</v>

747
00:43:29.730 --> 00:43:30.563
<v Speaker 4>no liberal sitting after the 2018 </v>
<v Speaker 4>election that would send a message to </v>

748
00:43:34.171 --> 00:43:35.004
<v Speaker 4>the social justice warrior types.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would also send a message to the </v>

749
00:43:37.681 --> 00:43:41.790
<v Speaker 4>centrists who should actually be </v>
<v Speaker 4>occupying the positions of power and the</v>

750
00:43:41.790 --> 00:43:45.360
<v Speaker 4>Liberal Party that if you allow yourself</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be taken over by a radical fringe,</v>

751
00:43:45.450 --> 00:43:47.700
<v Speaker 4>you're going to get decimated at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Poles.</v>

752
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.430
<v Speaker 4>So you know that might be an exciting </v>
<v Speaker 4>message to sell.</v>

753
00:43:50.431 --> 00:43:53.130
<v Speaker 4>Young people get out there and knock on </v>
<v Speaker 4>some doors.</v>

754
00:43:53.310 --> 00:43:57.780
<v Speaker 4>See if you can take the social justice </v>
<v Speaker 4>warriors out at the top before,</v>

755
00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:00.420
<v Speaker 4>before they do more damage than they've </v>
<v Speaker 4>already done.</v>

756
00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:01.433
<v Speaker 4>She's got another year to do plenty of </v>
<v Speaker 4>damage and you can be sure that she's </v>

757
00:44:03.811 --> 00:44:06.000
<v Speaker 4>going to do plenty more damage in that </v>
<v Speaker 4>year.</v>

758
00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:07.111
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

759
00:44:07.111 --> 00:44:09.120
<v Speaker 4>what else?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's some things you might think about</v>

760
00:44:09.121 --> 00:44:13.830
<v Speaker 4>if you're a conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these things have become,</v>

761
00:44:14.730 --> 00:44:17.730
<v Speaker 4>what would you say?</v>
<v Speaker 4>People are afraid to say them.</v>

762
00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:18.593
<v Speaker 4>Here's the first one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The fundamental assumptions of Western </v>

763
00:44:21.481 --> 00:44:25.080
<v Speaker 4>civilization are valid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How about that?</v>

764
00:44:25.470 --> 00:44:26.680
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not</v>

765
00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:32.150
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's an accident.</v>

766
00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:33.980
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's how you find out.</v>

767
00:44:33.981 --> 00:44:34.814
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which countries do people want to move </v>

768
00:44:36.381 --> 00:44:37.760
<v Speaker 5>away from?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

769
00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:38.713
<v Speaker 5>not ours.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Which countries do people wanting to </v>

770
00:44:40.941 --> 00:44:43.760
<v Speaker 5>move two hours?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Guess what?</v>

771
00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:44.743
<v Speaker 5>They work better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's not because we went around the </v>

772
00:44:46.641 --> 00:44:48.890
<v Speaker 5>world stealing everything we could get </v>
<v Speaker 5>her hands on.</v>

773
00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:51.560
<v Speaker 5>It's because we got certain fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 5>assumptions.</v>

774
00:44:51.561 --> 00:44:53.480
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Thank God for that.</v>

775
00:44:53.690 --> 00:44:57.200
<v Speaker 5>After thousands and thousands of years </v>
<v Speaker 5>of trying and because of that,</v>

776
00:44:57.201 --> 00:45:01.520
<v Speaker 5>we've managed to establish a set of </v>
<v Speaker 5>civilizations that are shining lights in</v>

777
00:45:01.521 --> 00:45:02.660
<v Speaker 5>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

778
00:45:02.661 --> 00:45:03.494
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can be pretty damn filthy and still </v>

779
00:45:05.151 --> 00:45:06.800
<v Speaker 5>be a shining light in this world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

780
00:45:06.801 --> 00:45:10.310
<v Speaker 5>Because if you look around the world at </v>
<v Speaker 5>the state of governance in most places,</v>

781
00:45:10.311 --> 00:45:15.311
<v Speaker 5>it's like the most pathological corrupt </v>
<v Speaker 5>and vicious thugs rule.</v>

782
00:45:15.620 --> 00:45:16.453
<v Speaker 5>And to stand out as an illuminated light</v>
<v Speaker 5>against that background is it so </v>

783
00:45:19.041 --> 00:45:20.630
<v Speaker 5>difficult?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But nonetheless,</v>

784
00:45:20.631 --> 00:45:21.464
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're as good as its got and unless we </v>

785
00:45:23.991 --> 00:45:24.824
<v Speaker 5>can come up with something better,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we should be very careful about messing </v>

786
00:45:26.961 --> 00:45:27.710
<v Speaker 5>around with that.</v>

787
00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:28.543
<v Speaker 5>So why don't we start with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>assumption that we're doing something </v>

788
00:45:30.261 --> 00:45:32.030
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the things we're doing right,</v>

789
00:45:32.031 --> 00:45:32.864
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that we actually value the </v>

790
00:45:34.641 --> 00:45:35.710
<v Speaker 5>individual,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

791
00:45:35.930 --> 00:45:39.500
<v Speaker 5>The individual has intrinsic value in </v>
<v Speaker 5>western societies.</v>

792
00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:42.770
<v Speaker 5>Do you know how long it took people to </v>
<v Speaker 5>formulate that as an idea?</v>

793
00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:45.620
<v Speaker 5>And how unlikely that idea is that poor </v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

794
00:45:45.621 --> 00:45:49.790
<v Speaker 5>you don't useless,</v>
<v Speaker 5>powerless you with all your damn fault.</v>

795
00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:53.660
<v Speaker 5>You're actually worth something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're worth something to the point that</v>

796
00:45:53.661 --> 00:45:56.600
<v Speaker 5>the law has to respect you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>

797
00:45:56.720 --> 00:46:00.290
<v Speaker 5>we don't want to abandon that for some </v>
<v Speaker 5>halfway did collectivism,</v>

798
00:46:00.291 --> 00:46:01.124
<v Speaker 5>which we're doing as rapidly as possible</v>
<v Speaker 5>because one of the things that </v>

799
00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:04.263
<v Speaker 5>characterizes the radical left types is </v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't give a damn about you as an </v>

800
00:46:07.701 --> 00:46:08.534
<v Speaker 5>individual or about individuals at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're black or you're white or you're </v>

801
00:46:11.901 --> 00:46:14.940
<v Speaker 5>Latino or you're transsexual,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're homosexual,</v>

802
00:46:15.110 --> 00:46:17.210
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're a group,</v>

803
00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:18.073
<v Speaker 5>you're a member of a group.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the only thing that matters is the </v>

804
00:46:20.091 --> 00:46:20.930
<v Speaker 5>group.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

805
00:46:20.931 --> 00:46:24.050
<v Speaker 5>I can tell you if the only thing that </v>
<v Speaker 5>matters is the group,</v>

806
00:46:24.110 --> 00:46:24.943
<v Speaker 5>you bloody well don't matter very much.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then you got to ask yourself just </v>

807
00:46:28.401 --> 00:46:31.160
<v Speaker 5>exactly what sort of people are trying </v>
<v Speaker 5>to set things up.</v>

808
00:46:31.161 --> 00:46:34.970
<v Speaker 5>So it is that the individual doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>matter very much.</v>

809
00:46:35.150 --> 00:46:35.983
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's the sort of people to whom the </v>

810
00:46:37.191 --> 00:46:41.210
<v Speaker 5>individual doesn't matter very much.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I might suggest that you don't elect</v>

811
00:46:41.211 --> 00:46:42.044
<v Speaker 5>them and that when they attempt to take </v>
<v Speaker 5>power that you do everything you can to </v>

812
00:46:44.511 --> 00:46:45.180
<v Speaker 5>stop.</v>

813
00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:46.013
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

814
00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:52.080
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's assumption number one,</v>

815
00:46:52.890 --> 00:46:53.723
<v Speaker 5>the assumption number two,</v>
<v Speaker 5>peaceful social being is preferable to </v>

816
00:46:57.691 --> 00:47:02.691
<v Speaker 5>isolation and to war in consequence at </v>
<v Speaker 5>justly and rightly demand.</v>

817
00:47:03.271 --> 00:47:06.480
<v Speaker 5>Some sacrifice of individual impulse.</v>
<v Speaker 5>An idiosyncrasy.</v>

818
00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:09.240
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so you want to live alone in the bush,</v>

819
00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:10.760
<v Speaker 5>you're going to starve to death and </v>
<v Speaker 5>beat.</v>

820
00:47:10.761 --> 00:47:13.650
<v Speaker 5>And by black flies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not a good solution,</v>

821
00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:14.693
<v Speaker 5>okay?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you have to cooperate with other </v>

822
00:47:15.991 --> 00:47:16.824
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that means you can't get to be your </v>

823
00:47:18.241 --> 00:47:19.074
<v Speaker 5>whimsical self 100% of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It means that most of you has to be </v>

824
00:47:23.370 --> 00:47:27.690
<v Speaker 5>sacrificed so that you can be </v>
<v Speaker 5>approximately like everyone else.</v>

825
00:47:27.810 --> 00:47:29.250
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a real sacrifice.</v>

826
00:47:29.470 --> 00:47:30.850
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a sacrifice of,</v>

827
00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:31.973
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it might even be a sacrifice of some of </v>

828
00:47:33.311 --> 00:47:36.340
<v Speaker 5>the unique qualities that everyone needs</v>
<v Speaker 5>from you,</v>

829
00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:37.233
<v Speaker 5>socialization costs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the advantage of it is while we get </v>

830
00:47:40.481 --> 00:47:41.291
<v Speaker 5>to exist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

831
00:47:41.291 --> 00:47:42.124
<v Speaker 5>we can all sit together in this hall and</v>
<v Speaker 5>no one has their hands around each </v>

832
00:47:45.221 --> 00:47:46.060
<v Speaker 5>other's throats.</v>

833
00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:48.490
<v Speaker 5>And we're talking about serious things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

834
00:47:48.491 --> 00:47:49.324
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's worth something and what it's </v>

835
00:47:50.681 --> 00:47:51.514
<v Speaker 5>worth and parties.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't get to be whatever </v>

836
00:47:53.331 --> 00:47:56.710
<v Speaker 5>spectacularly colored creature you want </v>
<v Speaker 5>to be all the time.</v>

837
00:47:57.250 --> 00:48:02.250
<v Speaker 5>You have to do what you can to be normal</v>
<v Speaker 5>and predictable and it's not like normal</v>

838
00:48:02.981 --> 00:48:05.470
<v Speaker 5>and predictable is the highest virtue </v>
<v Speaker 5>because it's not.</v>

839
00:48:05.830 --> 00:48:06.663
<v Speaker 5>And then being more than normal and </v>
<v Speaker 5>being and being unique and creative and </v>

840
00:48:10.331 --> 00:48:12.490
<v Speaker 5>contributing in that way is </v>
<v Speaker 5>extraordinarily important.</v>

841
00:48:12.491 --> 00:48:17.380
<v Speaker 5>But the fundamental point is is that </v>
<v Speaker 5>social being requires the sacrifice of a</v>

842
00:48:17.381 --> 00:48:18.214
<v Speaker 5>certain amount of individual </v>
<v Speaker 5>idiosyncrasies and that's a </v>

843
00:48:19.751 --> 00:48:23.230
<v Speaker 5>fundamentally conservative claim.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like you should be,</v>

844
00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:24.093
<v Speaker 5>you should do what everyone else does </v>
<v Speaker 5>unless you have a really good reason to </v>

845
00:48:28.510 --> 00:48:30.640
<v Speaker 5>vary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a good rule.</v>

846
00:48:30.641 --> 00:48:33.610
<v Speaker 5>It's like you do what people have done </v>
<v Speaker 5>throughout time.</v>

847
00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:36.430
<v Speaker 5>You grow up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you find a partner,</v>

848
00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:39.490
<v Speaker 5>you establish a stable relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get a job,</v>

849
00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:40.720
<v Speaker 5>you make yourself useful.</v>

850
00:48:40.810 --> 00:48:41.643
<v Speaker 5>You have some children,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you do something productive and </v>

851
00:48:43.601 --> 00:48:44.434
<v Speaker 5>interesting with your spare time and you</v>
<v Speaker 5>try to act like a respectable human </v>

852
00:48:46.991 --> 00:48:48.850
<v Speaker 5>being.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what you do.</v>

853
00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.520
<v Speaker 5>That's a conservative ethos.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if you're,</v>

854
00:48:51.610 --> 00:48:52.443
<v Speaker 5>if you have something spectacular about </v>
<v Speaker 5>you that needs to be revealed to the </v>

855
00:48:54.971 --> 00:48:57.130
<v Speaker 5>world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then break some rules,</v>

856
00:48:57.131 --> 00:48:58.180
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go right ahead.</v>

857
00:48:58.390 --> 00:49:01.930
<v Speaker 5>I'm dead serious about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But most of the time he had don't.</v>

858
00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:05.380
<v Speaker 5>And even if you happen to be a special </v>
<v Speaker 5>person and you might be,</v>

859
00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:06.513
<v Speaker 5>90% of you still isn't special.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So most of the time you're still going </v>

860
00:49:09.551 --> 00:49:12.790
<v Speaker 5>to be following the rules and the rules </v>
<v Speaker 5>aren't there to oh press.</v>

861
00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:13.833
<v Speaker 5>They're there to keep us at,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're there to keep us away from each </v>

862
00:49:16.421 --> 00:49:17.254
<v Speaker 5>other's throats because human beings are</v>
<v Speaker 5>very warlike and we're very competitive </v>

863
00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:22.503
<v Speaker 5>and we're very aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if we are fortunate enough to have </v>

864
00:49:27.221 --> 00:49:28.054
<v Speaker 5>woven together a social fabric that </v>
<v Speaker 5>basically renders us peaceful and </v>

865
00:49:31.541 --> 00:49:32.374
<v Speaker 5>cooperative,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we should try disrupting that at our </v>

866
00:49:36.310 --> 00:49:37.600
<v Speaker 5>great peril.</v>

867
00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:43.320
<v Speaker 5>Because the general rule for human </v>
<v Speaker 5>existence,</v>

868
00:49:43.601 --> 00:49:48.160
<v Speaker 5>throat the centuries has been per moyle </v>
<v Speaker 5>and war and we don't have that here.</v>

869
00:49:48.310 --> 00:49:52.060
<v Speaker 5>And so thank God for that and it's worth</v>
<v Speaker 5>a bit of a sacrifice.</v>

870
00:49:52.630 --> 00:49:56.050
<v Speaker 5>Next.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Equality,</v>

871
00:49:56.590 --> 00:49:57.700
<v Speaker 5>equity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>equity,</v>

872
00:49:57.701 --> 00:49:58.630
<v Speaker 5>that's worse,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

873
00:49:58.631 --> 00:49:59.464
<v Speaker 5>Equity means equality of outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It means that every single organization </v>

874
00:50:03.671 --> 00:50:04.504
<v Speaker 5>has 50% women and 50% men.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't matter whether the men and </v>

875
00:50:07.781 --> 00:50:09.790
<v Speaker 5>women differ in their intrinsic </v>
<v Speaker 5>preferences,</v>

876
00:50:09.910 --> 00:50:14.910
<v Speaker 5>which by the way they do the scientific </v>
<v Speaker 5>literature on that is completely clear.</v>

877
00:50:15.100 --> 00:50:15.933
<v Speaker 5>It was established by the early nineties</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was established in the Scandinavian </v>

878
00:50:18.911 --> 00:50:19.744
<v Speaker 5>countries where they've done most to </v>
<v Speaker 5>flatten out the socioeconomic </v>

879
00:50:23.170 --> 00:50:24.003
<v Speaker 5>differential saved between men and women</v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't get rid of the differences </v>

880
00:50:25.961 --> 00:50:27.500
<v Speaker 5>between men and women.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>

881
00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:28.513
<v Speaker 5>they became exaggerated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The biggest personality differences in </v>

882
00:50:30.741 --> 00:50:33.290
<v Speaker 5>the world between men and women are in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Scandinavia.</v>

883
00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:34.153
<v Speaker 5>Just as the biggest differences in </v>
<v Speaker 5>interests between men and women are in </v>

884
00:50:36.231 --> 00:50:37.064
<v Speaker 5>Scandinavia.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because when you get rid of the socio </v>

885
00:50:39.501 --> 00:50:41.810
<v Speaker 5>cultural differences between men and </v>
<v Speaker 5>women,</v>

886
00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:44.390
<v Speaker 5>the biological differences don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>disappear.</v>

887
00:50:44.570 --> 00:50:47.060
<v Speaker 5>They maximize.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How else could it be?</v>

888
00:50:47.210 --> 00:50:49.250
<v Speaker 5>And as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the literature on that is clear.</v>

889
00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:53.600
<v Speaker 5>And the way that the postmodernist </v>
<v Speaker 5>radicals react to that is by criticizing</v>

890
00:50:53.601 --> 00:50:56.660
<v Speaker 5>the scientific method itself on their </v>
<v Speaker 5>computers,</v>

891
00:50:56.661 --> 00:50:57.494
<v Speaker 5>which only work of course,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because of the scientific method </v>

892
00:50:59.211 --> 00:50:59.630
<v Speaker 5>actually right?</v>

893
00:50:59.630 --> 00:51:04.630
<v Speaker 2>Works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

894
00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:14.610
<v Speaker 5>you hear the Egalitarian Clarion call </v>
<v Speaker 5>everywhere.</v>

895
00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:16.343
<v Speaker 5>Everything should be equal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everything should be equally </v>

896
00:51:18.031 --> 00:51:20.190
<v Speaker 5>distributed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We should strive for equity.</v>

897
00:51:20.191 --> 00:51:24.240
<v Speaker 5>It's like wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially if you're a conservative,</v>

898
00:51:24.510 --> 00:51:25.343
<v Speaker 5>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What we want are just hierarchies of </v>

899
00:51:29.341 --> 00:51:32.760
<v Speaker 5>competence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not everyone's a neurosurgeon.</v>

900
00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:36.000
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if your father has a brain tumor,</v>

901
00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:37.013
<v Speaker 5>you probably want a hierarchy of </v>
<v Speaker 5>competence for neurosurgeons so you can </v>

902
00:51:40.501 --> 00:51:43.770
<v Speaker 5>pick the one that's the best so that he </v>
<v Speaker 5>might not die.</v>

903
00:51:44.130 --> 00:51:46.300
<v Speaker 5>That's what a hierarchy of competence is</v>
<v Speaker 5>for.</v>

904
00:51:46.590 --> 00:51:49.140
<v Speaker 5>For the postmodernist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's no hierarchy that isn't based on</v>

905
00:51:49.141 --> 00:51:49.974
<v Speaker 5>power while because they think the world</v>
<v Speaker 5>runs on power and that's why they're </v>

906
00:51:53.101 --> 00:51:53.934
<v Speaker 5>willing to use power to get what they </v>
<v Speaker 5>want because it's the only thing they </v>

907
00:51:56.851 --> 00:51:59.490
<v Speaker 5>believe in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but a valid hierarchy of competence.</v>

908
00:51:59.491 --> 00:52:00.960
<v Speaker 5>It's God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We need those things,</v>

909
00:52:00.961 --> 00:52:03.090
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We need the best plumbers.</v>

910
00:52:03.150 --> 00:52:05.400
<v Speaker 5>We need the best contractors.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We need the best.</v>

911
00:52:05.940 --> 00:52:09.690
<v Speaker 5>We knew we need the best carpenters,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we need the best lecturers.</v>

912
00:52:09.870 --> 00:52:13.530
<v Speaker 5>There has to be a hierarchy of quality </v>
<v Speaker 5>now,</v>

913
00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:16.800
<v Speaker 5>not only so that we know who the best </v>
<v Speaker 5>are and to reward them properly,</v>

914
00:52:16.801 --> 00:52:19.590
<v Speaker 5>but so that we can reward them so they </v>
<v Speaker 5>keep being the best.</v>

915
00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:20.581
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

916
00:52:20.581 --> 00:52:23.010
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you have a great educator,</v>

917
00:52:23.011 --> 00:52:26.550
<v Speaker 5>if you have a great leader,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you have a great thinker,</v>

918
00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:27.473
<v Speaker 5>you want to reward them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they keep thinking and they keep </v>

919
00:52:29.251 --> 00:52:31.440
<v Speaker 5>educating so they can tell you </v>
<v Speaker 5>something.</v>

920
00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:34.140
<v Speaker 5>It's not a reward for their intrinsic </v>
<v Speaker 5>being.</v>

921
00:52:34.350 --> 00:52:38.400
<v Speaker 5>It's a calculated move on your part to </v>
<v Speaker 5>suck everything out of them.</v>

922
00:52:38.401 --> 00:52:39.234
<v Speaker 5>That's valuable as fast as you can.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what a hierarchy of competence </v>

923
00:52:42.291 --> 00:52:43.124
<v Speaker 5>is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Four.</v>

924
00:52:43.140 --> 00:52:46.280
<v Speaker 5>And the idea is that hierarchies of </v>
<v Speaker 5>competence don't exist is,</v>

925
00:52:46.380 --> 00:52:47.213
<v Speaker 5>it's so cynical.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's such a pathologically cynical idea </v>

926
00:52:50.070 --> 00:52:51.870
<v Speaker 5>and it's actually quite patently untrue.</v>

927
00:52:51.870 --> 00:52:54.960
<v Speaker 5>Because here's an interesting tidbit </v>
<v Speaker 5>from the psychological literature.</v>

928
00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:59.940
<v Speaker 5>Let's say you want to determine what the</v>
<v Speaker 5>best predictors are for lifetime success</v>

929
00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:02.040
<v Speaker 5>in a Western society.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

930
00:53:02.041 --> 00:53:04.950
<v Speaker 5>what would you hope for?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How about intelligence?</v>

931
00:53:05.190 --> 00:53:09.290
<v Speaker 5>There would be a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's hope this smart people occupy more</v>

932
00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:11.460
<v Speaker 5>positions of complexity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

933
00:53:11.461 --> 00:53:15.360
<v Speaker 5>Because they're smarter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do you want it any other way?</v>

934
00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:16.351
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then so,</v>

935
00:53:16.351 --> 00:53:17.184
<v Speaker 5>and that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The number one predictor of </v>

936
00:53:18.780 --> 00:53:22.200
<v Speaker 5>accomplishment in western societies is </v>
<v Speaker 5>intelligence.</v>

937
00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:25.290
<v Speaker 5>So that means the system works.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's the number two predictor?</v>

938
00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:27.540
<v Speaker 5>Conscientiousness?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

939
00:53:27.541 --> 00:53:30.180
<v Speaker 5>what's that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a trademark or for hard work.</v>

940
00:53:30.330 --> 00:53:34.380
<v Speaker 5>So who co who gets ahead?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Smart people who work hard.</v>

941
00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:35.453
<v Speaker 5>Now that doesn't account for every bit </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the difference between people in </v>

942
00:53:38.701 --> 00:53:42.210
<v Speaker 5>terms of their hierarchical structure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because hierarchies aren't perfect.</v>

943
00:53:42.211 --> 00:53:43.044
<v Speaker 5>They're corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People get to the top sometimes because </v>

944
00:53:44.791 --> 00:53:46.530
<v Speaker 5>there's psychopathic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>although believe me,</v>

945
00:53:46.531 --> 00:53:47.364
<v Speaker 5>a hell of a lot less than you think </v>
<v Speaker 5>because a psychopath has to keep moving </v>

946
00:53:50.551 --> 00:53:51.384
<v Speaker 5>from place to place because once he </v>
<v Speaker 5>reveals himself as deceitful and </v>

947
00:53:53.911 --> 00:53:56.760
<v Speaker 5>untrustworthy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he has to go find new suckers to fleece.</v>

948
00:53:56.940 --> 00:54:00.360
<v Speaker 5>So the idea that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's no distinction between a CEO and</v>

949
00:54:00.361 --> 00:54:01.194
<v Speaker 5>a psychopath.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like that's only made by someone </v>

950
00:54:03.180 --> 00:54:05.490
<v Speaker 5>who a knows nothing about psychopaths </v>
<v Speaker 5>be,</v>

951
00:54:05.491 --> 00:54:06.324
<v Speaker 5>knows nothing about ceos.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And C has something fundamental against </v>

952
00:54:10.441 --> 00:54:13.800
<v Speaker 5>the entire capitalist structure because </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's simply not true.</v>

953
00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:16.350
<v Speaker 5>Corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sometimes greedy,</v>

954
00:54:16.410 --> 00:54:17.243
<v Speaker 5>sometimes shortsighted,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sometimes running companies that are </v>

955
00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:22.710
<v Speaker 5>doing their best to auger themselves </v>
<v Speaker 5>into the ground.</v>

956
00:54:22.711 --> 00:54:23.580
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

957
00:54:23.581 --> 00:54:26.250
<v Speaker 5>it's bad people running a dying </v>
<v Speaker 5>organization.</v>

958
00:54:26.610 --> 00:54:28.590
<v Speaker 5>But generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not the case.</v>

959
00:54:28.591 --> 00:54:31.620
<v Speaker 5>Our hierarchies of competence are </v>
<v Speaker 5>reasonably functional.</v>

960
00:54:31.740 --> 00:54:34.170
<v Speaker 5>And not only are they functional,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're valuable.</v>

961
00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:37.170
<v Speaker 5>We need to know who the competent people</v>
<v Speaker 5>are and we need to reward them.</v>

962
00:54:37.171 --> 00:54:39.750
<v Speaker 5>And even more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we need to tell young people,</v>

963
00:54:40.050 --> 00:54:40.883
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's some hierarchies of competence </v>

964
00:54:41.911 --> 00:54:44.970
<v Speaker 5>out there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a thousand of them.</v>

965
00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:47.370
<v Speaker 5>Go be a plumber man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but be a good one.</v>

966
00:54:47.371 --> 00:54:48.510
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>being honest,</v>

967
00:54:48.511 --> 00:54:50.310
<v Speaker 5>one B,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had a plumber once,</v>

968
00:54:50.311 --> 00:54:51.144
<v Speaker 5>you know it was the night,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was the night before we were putting </v>

969
00:54:53.911 --> 00:54:54.960
<v Speaker 5>drywall in our house.</v>

970
00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:58.350
<v Speaker 5>We were redoing a house and he had put </v>
<v Speaker 5>in all the plastic piping,</v>

971
00:54:58.351 --> 00:55:00.750
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I was going to test the joints,</v>

972
00:55:00.780 --> 00:55:01.613
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're supposed to be glued together </v>

973
00:55:02.131 --> 00:55:03.300
<v Speaker 5>with his pipe glue,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

974
00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:04.433
<v Speaker 5>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I told him I had to test the joints and </v>

975
00:55:05.851 --> 00:55:07.650
<v Speaker 5>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well you don't have to test my joints.</v>

976
00:55:07.651 --> 00:55:08.730
<v Speaker 5>They never leak.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I thought,</v>

977
00:55:08.731 --> 00:55:09.960
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's okay.</v>

978
00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:10.913
<v Speaker 5>How about if I test them?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I went up on the third floor and </v>

979
00:55:13.230 --> 00:55:16.200
<v Speaker 5>filled the pipes with water,</v>
<v Speaker 5>capping them in the basement like you're</v>

980
00:55:16.201 --> 00:55:18.720
<v Speaker 5>supposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like half an hour later I had two inches</v>

981
00:55:18.721 --> 00:55:21.780
<v Speaker 5>of water in the basement.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There were 30 leaking joints.</v>

982
00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:22.753
<v Speaker 5>And that was the night before the </v>
<v Speaker 5>drywallers were supposed to show up so </v>

983
00:55:25.860 --> 00:55:27.960
<v Speaker 5>well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he wasn't particularly competent.</v>

984
00:55:27.961 --> 00:55:30.150
<v Speaker 5>That's the point of that story.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But even more so,</v>

985
00:55:30.390 --> 00:55:35.070
<v Speaker 5>he had put a bunch of the plastic pipe </v>
<v Speaker 5>outside where the drywall would be,</v>

986
00:55:35.071 --> 00:55:36.600
<v Speaker 5>so it would have been sticking through </v>
<v Speaker 5>the wall.</v>

987
00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:38.700
<v Speaker 5>So I spent a frenetic night,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

988
00:55:38.730 --> 00:55:42.360
<v Speaker 5>sewing three plastic pipe and re gluing </v>
<v Speaker 5>joints so that my,</v>

989
00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:44.430
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so that the drywallers could come in.</v>

990
00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:46.710
<v Speaker 5>What's the point?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're going to be a plumber,</v>

991
00:55:46.711 --> 00:55:47.544
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>be a good plumber because otherwise all </v>

992
00:55:49.141 --> 00:55:50.760
<v Speaker 5>you do is go out there and cause </v>
<v Speaker 5>trouble.</v>

993
00:55:51.090 --> 00:55:53.010
<v Speaker 5>And we don't need people to cause more </v>
<v Speaker 5>trouble.</v>

994
00:55:53.130 --> 00:55:55.590
<v Speaker 5>We need people to solve problems,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

995
00:55:55.591 --> 00:55:57.510
<v Speaker 5>And so you can be a tradesman and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>can be,</v>

996
00:55:57.600 --> 00:55:59.220
<v Speaker 5>can make a lot of money as a trades </v>
<v Speaker 5>person.</v>

997
00:55:59.221 --> 00:56:02.130
<v Speaker 5>It's a bloody reliable,</v>
<v Speaker 5>honorable,</v>

998
00:56:02.370 --> 00:56:03.810
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>forthright,</v>

999
00:56:03.870 --> 00:56:04.703
<v Speaker 5>productive way of making a living.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there is a hell of a lot of </v>

1000
00:56:06.841 --> 00:56:07.674
<v Speaker 5>difference between a working man who </v>
<v Speaker 5>knows what he's doing and one who </v>

1001
00:56:11.581 --> 00:56:14.160
<v Speaker 5>doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>both in terms of skill and ethics.</v>

1002
00:56:14.220 --> 00:56:16.590
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you work with someone who knows what</v>

1003
00:56:16.591 --> 00:56:17.940
<v Speaker 5>they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a bloody pleasure.</v>

1004
00:56:18.270 --> 00:56:19.590
<v Speaker 5>They tell you what they're gonna do.</v>

1005
00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:22.200
<v Speaker 5>They tell you how much it will cost,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they go and do it.</v>

1006
00:56:22.201 --> 00:56:24.430
<v Speaker 5>It works,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you pay them perfect.</v>

1007
00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:25.473
<v Speaker 5>Everyone's happy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's what happens when you have </v>

1008
00:56:27.041 --> 00:56:29.400
<v Speaker 5>genuine hierarchies of competence and so</v>
<v Speaker 5>you to,</v>

1009
00:56:29.401 --> 00:56:32.050
<v Speaker 5>you listen to these panderers of </v>
<v Speaker 5>egalitarianism,</v>

1010
00:56:32.330 --> 00:56:34.120
<v Speaker 5>gell egalitarianism,</v>
<v Speaker 5>inequity,</v>

1011
00:56:34.330 --> 00:56:35.163
<v Speaker 5>and they fail to recognize completely </v>
<v Speaker 5>that there are differences in ranked </v>

1012
00:56:38.021 --> 00:56:40.210
<v Speaker 5>between people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not such a terrible thing,</v>

1013
00:56:40.211 --> 00:56:41.044
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe you wouldn't be a great lawyer </v>

1014
00:56:42.341 --> 00:56:44.650
<v Speaker 5>like it's certainly possible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Most people aren't.</v>

1015
00:56:44.830 --> 00:56:47.230
<v Speaker 5>But that doesn't mean there isn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>something you could be great at.</v>

1016
00:56:47.231 --> 00:56:51.310
<v Speaker 5>There's lots of hierarchies to attempt </v>
<v Speaker 5>to climb and if he failed in one,</v>

1017
00:56:51.670 --> 00:56:53.950
<v Speaker 5>go try in another.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the point is,</v>

1018
00:56:53.951 --> 00:56:57.400
<v Speaker 5>you're still trying to aim for the top </v>
<v Speaker 5>and what the hell are you going to do if</v>

1019
00:56:57.401 --> 00:56:59.390
<v Speaker 5>you don't try to aim for the top,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1020
00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:02.470
<v Speaker 5>flap about uselessly and whine about </v>
<v Speaker 5>your life.</v>

1021
00:57:02.620 --> 00:57:05.470
<v Speaker 5>It's not helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It'll just make you miserable.</v>

1022
00:57:05.500 --> 00:57:08.980
<v Speaker 5>You're not reliable to anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't help out in a crisis.</v>

1023
00:57:09.250 --> 00:57:10.990
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so you tell young people,</v>

1024
00:57:10.991 --> 00:57:12.610
<v Speaker 5>and this is another message for </v>
<v Speaker 5>conservatives,</v>

1025
00:57:12.611 --> 00:57:14.140
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't care why you're going to do,</v>

1026
00:57:14.141 --> 00:57:16.930
<v Speaker 5>but go out there and make something of </v>
<v Speaker 5>yourself for God's sake.</v>

1027
00:57:16.931 --> 00:57:17.764
<v Speaker 5>Be An honest person and work and get to </v>
<v Speaker 5>the top of whatever it is that you want </v>

1028
00:57:21.611 --> 00:57:23.500
<v Speaker 5>to get to the top of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1029
00:57:23.501 --> 00:57:24.191
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

1030
00:57:24.191 --> 00:57:25.024
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and stand up for yourself like a </v>

1031
00:57:26.861 --> 00:57:27.694
<v Speaker 5>respectable human being and be a bit of </v>
<v Speaker 5>a light on the world instead of a </v>

1032
00:57:30.401 --> 00:57:32.200
<v Speaker 5>blight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1033
00:57:32.380 --> 00:57:33.213
<v Speaker 5>and you can tell young people that and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they haven't been told that by anyone </v>

1034
00:57:35.831 --> 00:57:36.664
<v Speaker 5>now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so the young men are so hungry for </v>

1035
00:57:37.811 --> 00:57:38.480
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that it's,</v>

1036
00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:42.070
<v Speaker 5>it's painful to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're so relieved when funding was,</v>

1037
00:57:42.071 --> 00:57:43.930
<v Speaker 5>someone finally comes up and says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

1038
00:57:43.931 --> 00:57:45.120
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

1039
00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:48.160
<v Speaker 5>you get your act together bit discipline</v>
<v Speaker 5>yourself.</v>

1040
00:57:48.190 --> 00:57:49.023
<v Speaker 5>See if you can learn to tell the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Concentrate on something for a year or </v>

1041
00:57:51.311 --> 00:57:53.830
<v Speaker 5>two.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could be a bloody world beater.</v>

1042
00:57:53.860 --> 00:57:56.140
<v Speaker 5>They think freely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's possible.</v>

1043
00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:57.100
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That would be,</v>

1044
00:57:57.190 --> 00:57:58.023
<v Speaker 5>that would be interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That might make life or life worth </v>

1045
00:58:00.491 --> 00:58:01.390
<v Speaker 5>living.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

1046
00:58:01.391 --> 00:58:02.470
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it might.</v>

1047
00:58:02.471 --> 00:58:05.740
<v Speaker 5>So why don't you go do it now?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's what the damn universities,</v>

1048
00:58:05.741 --> 00:58:07.990
<v Speaker 5>we're supposed to be teaching people and</v>
<v Speaker 5>they've forgotten that.</v>

1049
00:58:08.260 --> 00:58:10.690
<v Speaker 5>I went to Harvard month ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>month and a half.</v>

1050
00:58:10.820 --> 00:58:13.600
<v Speaker 5>You used to teach there and I talked to </v>
<v Speaker 5>a bunch of students,</v>

1051
00:58:13.601 --> 00:58:14.434
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I told them it's not easy to get </v>

1052
00:58:15.881 --> 00:58:16.780
<v Speaker 5>into Harvard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1053
00:58:17.050 --> 00:58:17.883
<v Speaker 5>like you're a Valedictorian if you're at</v>
<v Speaker 5>Harvard and not only are you a </v>

1054
00:58:20.771 --> 00:58:24.070
<v Speaker 5>Valedictorian,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're way better than most people at at</v>

1055
00:58:24.071 --> 00:58:26.590
<v Speaker 5>least two other things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or you don't get in.</v>

1056
00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:29.800
<v Speaker 5>It's so like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what the acceptance rate is</v>

1057
00:58:29.801 --> 00:58:32.770
<v Speaker 5>like 5% and believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not everybody applies.</v>

1058
00:58:32.770 --> 00:58:33.603
<v Speaker 5>So it's a very selective school.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so why am I saying now it's like </v>

1059
00:58:36.940 --> 00:58:40.960
<v Speaker 5>these are high quality kids.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I told them what I just told you.</v>

1060
00:58:40.961 --> 00:58:45.070
<v Speaker 5>It's like here you are at Harvard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like get yourself educated man.</v>

1061
00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:46.720
<v Speaker 5>Read some books,</v>
<v Speaker 5>learn to talk,</v>

1062
00:58:46.721 --> 00:58:49.060
<v Speaker 5>learn to think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>make yourself into something,</v>

1063
00:58:49.210 --> 00:58:50.043
<v Speaker 5>get the hell out there and make the </v>
<v Speaker 5>world that put you here happy that you </v>

1064
00:58:53.651 --> 00:58:56.170
<v Speaker 5>were put there in that great </v>
<v Speaker 5>institution.</v>

1065
00:58:56.410 --> 00:58:57.243
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they came up to me afterwards and </v>

1066
00:58:59.051 --> 00:58:59.950
<v Speaker 5>said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>

1067
00:58:59.951 --> 00:59:03.550
<v Speaker 5>I wish someone would have told us that </v>
<v Speaker 5>when we were in our first year.</v>

1068
00:59:03.700 --> 00:59:04.840
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jesus,</v>

1069
00:59:04.930 --> 00:59:07.660
<v Speaker 5>why didn't someone tell them math for </v>
<v Speaker 5>God's sake?</v>

1070
00:59:07.661 --> 00:59:08.494
<v Speaker 5>It's supposed to be the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 5>university in the world is it's so </v>

1071
00:59:11.111 --> 00:59:13.660
<v Speaker 5>difficult to figure that out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1072
00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:14.553
<v Speaker 5>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If that is what you want to have happen </v>

1073
00:59:16.121 --> 00:59:16.954
<v Speaker 5>in the university,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you want to make cringing Melk sops who </v>

1074
00:59:19.001 --> 00:59:22.580
<v Speaker 5>whine about being victims while they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to ivy league institutions.</v>

1075
00:59:22.820 --> 00:59:23.653
<v Speaker 5>Jesus</v>

1076
00:59:23.980 --> 00:59:24.813
<v Speaker 2>pathetic.</v>

1077
00:59:34.410 --> 00:59:37.620
<v Speaker 5>Here's an old idea from Carl Young.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really liked this idea.</v>

1078
00:59:37.621 --> 00:59:38.670
<v Speaker 5>It's a rough one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1079
00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:39.713
<v Speaker 5>It's like a psychotherapeutic scalpel.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's say someone's doing something to </v>

1080
00:59:42.511 --> 00:59:43.344
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't understand it's producing </v>

1081
00:59:44.041 --> 00:59:45.990
<v Speaker 5>nothing but misery has an outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

1082
00:59:45.991 --> 00:59:48.420
<v Speaker 5>what the hell is your motivation?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They won't tell you.</v>

1083
00:59:48.421 --> 00:59:49.254
<v Speaker 5>Maybe they don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So Carl Jung's advice was look at the </v>

1084
00:59:51.991 --> 00:59:56.040
<v Speaker 5>outcome and in further motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

1085
00:59:56.041 --> 00:59:56.874
<v Speaker 5>so you produce a generation of students </v>
<v Speaker 5>privileged beyond belief in comparison </v>

1086
01:00:01.351 --> 01:00:04.710
<v Speaker 5>to the rest of like struggling humanity </v>
<v Speaker 5>in all of history.</v>

1087
01:00:04.860 --> 01:00:05.693
<v Speaker 5>You put them in Ivy League schools and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they come out thinking that they're </v>

1088
01:00:07.950 --> 01:00:10.260
<v Speaker 5>members of an oppressed group and </v>
<v Speaker 5>victims.</v>

1089
01:00:10.410 --> 01:00:11.041
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1090
01:00:11.041 --> 01:00:13.200
<v Speaker 5>why would you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why would anyone,</v>

1091
01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:15.390
<v Speaker 5>why would that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the answer is,</v>

1092
01:00:15.570 --> 01:00:16.403
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what the people who taught them </v>

1093
01:00:16.891 --> 01:00:19.590
<v Speaker 5>wanted to turn them into and then you </v>
<v Speaker 5>might think,</v>

1094
01:00:19.591 --> 01:00:20.424
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>did they do that because they cared for </v>

1095
01:00:21.541 --> 01:00:22.050
<v Speaker 5>them?</v>

1096
01:00:22.050 --> 01:00:25.950
<v Speaker 5>It seems bloody unlikely to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You take this great raw material,</v>

1097
01:00:25.951 --> 01:00:26.784
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's taken a lot of work to make </v>

1098
01:00:27.691 --> 01:00:30.720
<v Speaker 5>an institution like the University of </v>
<v Speaker 5>Toronto are like Harvard.</v>

1099
01:00:30.721 --> 01:00:34.560
<v Speaker 5>We'd been working on that for thousands </v>
<v Speaker 5>of years and you invite people in,</v>

1100
01:00:34.561 --> 01:00:35.394
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>thank God we selected you so carefully </v>

1101
01:00:36.871 --> 01:00:38.430
<v Speaker 5>because we think you could be a world </v>
<v Speaker 5>beater.</v>

1102
01:00:38.580 --> 01:00:41.040
<v Speaker 5>And then what we do is we don't teach </v>
<v Speaker 5>you how to think.</v>

1103
01:00:41.041 --> 01:00:43.890
<v Speaker 5>We don't teach you how to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We don't get you to read great books and</v>

1104
01:00:43.891 --> 01:00:47.250
<v Speaker 5>we convince you that you're a victim and</v>
<v Speaker 5>that your culture is corrupt.</v>

1105
01:00:47.370 --> 01:00:48.240
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>great.</v>

1106
01:00:48.510 --> 01:00:50.760
<v Speaker 5>Well those people are no friends of </v>
<v Speaker 5>those institutions.</v>

1107
01:00:50.761 --> 01:00:51.594
<v Speaker 5>I can tell you that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they're even less friends of those </v>

1108
01:00:52.951 --> 01:00:55.530
<v Speaker 5>students.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So hierarchies are cough,</v>

1109
01:00:55.531 --> 01:01:00.240
<v Speaker 5>competence are desirable and they should</v>
<v Speaker 5>be promoted.</v>

1110
01:01:00.630 --> 01:01:04.350
<v Speaker 5>So none of this idiot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>egalitarian equity,</v>

1111
01:01:04.470 --> 01:01:05.820
<v Speaker 5>it's not good for anyone.</v>

1112
01:01:05.820 --> 01:01:07.020
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's impossible.</v>

1113
01:01:07.021 --> 01:01:08.910
<v Speaker 5>Second,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it would be murderous to impose,</v>

1114
01:01:09.090 --> 01:01:10.920
<v Speaker 5>but third,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even if it succeeded,</v>

1115
01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:15.690
<v Speaker 5>it would fail as fast as it succeeded.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That would be how fast it would fail.</v>

1116
01:01:15.930 --> 01:01:19.530
<v Speaker 5>Why would you strive for anything if </v>
<v Speaker 5>there was no opt to strive for?</v>

1117
01:01:19.770 --> 01:01:23.700
<v Speaker 5>If everything's flat and equal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well when you're starving or dying,</v>

1118
01:01:23.820 --> 01:01:25.650
<v Speaker 5>then everyone's equal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And believe me,</v>

1119
01:01:25.651 --> 01:01:27.870
<v Speaker 5>the egalitarian,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the eye,</v>

1120
01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:28.713
<v Speaker 5>he galatarian totalitarians who </v>
<v Speaker 5>dominated the 20th century knew </v>

1121
01:01:32.221 --> 01:01:36.060
<v Speaker 5>perfectly well how to make people equal </v>
<v Speaker 5>and they made them equal in ghoulag work</v>

1122
01:01:36.061 --> 01:01:36.894
<v Speaker 5>camps and in starvation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm sure we could attain that if we </v>

1123
01:01:39.661 --> 01:01:42.180
<v Speaker 5>wanted to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So all right,</v>

1124
01:01:42.510 --> 01:01:46.620
<v Speaker 5>next borders are reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How about that?</v>

1125
01:01:54.940 --> 01:01:55.500
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1126
01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:59.910
<v Speaker 5>the law is the border that stops someone</v>
<v Speaker 5>from stealing your</v>

1127
01:02:02.270 --> 01:02:05.450
<v Speaker 5>laptop.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if it's an apple laptop,</v>

1128
01:02:05.451 --> 01:02:06.284
<v Speaker 5>while it's the sort of laptop that has </v>
<v Speaker 5>social justice warrior would carry and </v>

1129
01:02:09.381 --> 01:02:10.214
<v Speaker 5>then the social justice warrior is going</v>
<v Speaker 5>to be very irritated if you happen to </v>

1130
01:02:13.461 --> 01:02:15.980
<v Speaker 5>purloin their laptop.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then you might point out to them,</v>

1131
01:02:15.981 --> 01:02:16.814
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a border that protects from having </v>

1132
01:02:19.891 --> 01:02:21.780
<v Speaker 5>that thing taken and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1133
01:02:21.781 --> 01:02:23.490
<v Speaker 5>the border should be open.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's okay man.</v>

1134
01:02:23.491 --> 01:02:26.550
<v Speaker 5>No problem that you hand over that </v>
<v Speaker 5>laptop right now and everything else you</v>

1135
01:02:26.551 --> 01:02:27.384
<v Speaker 5>own too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you don't like borders and you can </v>

1136
01:02:28.531 --> 01:02:31.530
<v Speaker 5>get rid of the damn walls in your house </v>
<v Speaker 5>and you don't need doors on your bedroom</v>

1137
01:02:31.531 --> 01:02:32.364
<v Speaker 5>either and we can keep an eye on you </v>
<v Speaker 5>whenever we want and so much for </v>

1138
01:02:35.131 --> 01:02:35.964
<v Speaker 5>borders.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the things that really differs </v>

1139
01:02:37.351 --> 01:02:38.184
<v Speaker 5>between liberals and conservatives </v>
<v Speaker 5>between the left and the right is the </v>

1140
01:02:40.651 --> 01:02:43.560
<v Speaker 5>right is in the right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>likes tight borders between things.</v>

1141
01:02:43.830 --> 01:02:45.750
<v Speaker 5>It's part of being conscientious at </v>
<v Speaker 5>every level,</v>

1142
01:02:45.751 --> 01:02:47.460
<v Speaker 5>conceptually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sexually,</v>

1143
01:02:47.550 --> 01:02:49.950
<v Speaker 5>familiarly provincially,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nationally.</v>

1144
01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:51.180
<v Speaker 5>The right says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

1145
01:02:51.181 --> 01:02:52.014
<v Speaker 5>let's keep,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's keep the borders between things </v>

1146
01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:55.020
<v Speaker 5>pretty distinct.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the left says,</v>

1147
01:02:55.290 --> 01:02:56.123
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe not because some of those borders </v>

1148
01:02:57.961 --> 01:02:58.794
<v Speaker 5>are in the wrong place and a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 5>more free flow of information wouldn't </v>

1149
01:03:00.931 --> 01:03:02.550
<v Speaker 5>be a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the thing is,</v>

1150
01:03:03.090 --> 01:03:03.923
<v Speaker 5>they're right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but so are the Conservatives and that's </v>

1151
01:03:05.401 --> 01:03:06.780
<v Speaker 5>why you have to talk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

1152
01:03:06.810 --> 01:03:07.950
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we've got some borders.</v>

1153
01:03:08.670 --> 01:03:09.503
<v Speaker 5>That's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe some of them need to be moved </v>

1154
01:03:11.191 --> 01:03:12.024
<v Speaker 5>around a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's what the political dialogue </v>

1155
01:03:13.381 --> 01:03:14.214
<v Speaker 5>is for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that doesn't mean that borders </v>

1156
01:03:15.901 --> 01:03:16.734
<v Speaker 5>themselves are a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There are a great idea because without </v>

1157
01:03:19.921 --> 01:03:20.754
<v Speaker 5>borders,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything mashes into the same </v>

1158
01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:26.850
<v Speaker 5>untenable state of undifferentiated </v>
<v Speaker 5>chaos and you can't live in that.</v>

1159
01:03:27.150 --> 01:03:30.570
<v Speaker 5>And so the people who are trying to tear</v>
<v Speaker 5>down the borders conceptually,</v>

1160
01:03:30.571 --> 01:03:31.404
<v Speaker 5>politically,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and practically what they want is the </v>

1161
01:03:32.851 --> 01:03:34.200
<v Speaker 5>chaos that that would bring.</v>

1162
01:03:34.370 --> 01:03:38.250
<v Speaker 5>The either want that or they're too </v>
<v Speaker 5>foolish to know that their pursuits will</v>

1163
01:03:38.251 --> 01:03:40.050
<v Speaker 5>produce that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So let's,</v>

1164
01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:40.973
<v Speaker 5>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's be a little bit clear that if you </v>

1165
01:03:42.631 --> 01:03:44.370
<v Speaker 5>stand up and say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1166
01:03:44.430 --> 01:03:45.870
<v Speaker 5>borders,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're okay,</v>

1167
01:03:45.900 --> 01:03:47.460
<v Speaker 5>they've got their problems,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they're okay.</v>

1168
01:03:47.610 --> 01:03:49.080
<v Speaker 5>That doesn't make you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1169
01:03:49.450 --> 01:03:51.900
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a bigot beyond redemption.</v>

1170
01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:52.853
<v Speaker 5>It just makes you someone with some </v>
<v Speaker 5>sense and it's actually okay to be </v>

1171
01:03:56.341 --> 01:03:57.174
<v Speaker 5>someone with some sense</v>
<v Speaker 5>limits on immigration are also </v>

1172
01:04:00.991 --> 01:04:01.651
<v Speaker 5>reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1173
01:04:01.651 --> 01:04:05.010
<v Speaker 5>we need to figure out what those limits </v>
<v Speaker 5>are and that's what the bloody political</v>

1174
01:04:05.011 --> 01:04:05.844
<v Speaker 5>dialogue is for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the fact that it should be limited </v>

1175
01:04:07.351 --> 01:04:09.300
<v Speaker 5>to some degree is also reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Otherwise,</v>

1176
01:04:09.510 --> 01:04:12.540
<v Speaker 5>why not just open the borders and let </v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody come in?</v>

1177
01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:13.950
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the reason you don't do that,</v>

1178
01:04:13.951 --> 01:04:14.784
<v Speaker 5>it's because a complex system cannot </v>
<v Speaker 5>tolerate extensive transformation over </v>

1179
01:04:21.541 --> 01:04:24.750
<v Speaker 5>too short a period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now you want immigrants to come in,</v>

1180
01:04:24.751 --> 01:04:25.584
<v Speaker 5>especially if they're the sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 5>immigrants who are likely to contribute </v>

1181
01:04:29.251 --> 01:04:31.440
<v Speaker 5>properly to the success of your polity.</v>

1182
01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:33.360
<v Speaker 5>And lots of immigrants do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1183
01:04:33.510 --> 01:04:35.400
<v Speaker 5>I think the vast majority,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

1184
01:04:35.401 --> 01:04:38.460
<v Speaker 5>of entrepreneurs in the United States </v>
<v Speaker 5>come from the Indian subcontinent.</v>

1185
01:04:38.461 --> 01:04:41.610
<v Speaker 5>So great in Ho bring them over.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're highly educated,</v>

1186
01:04:41.611 --> 01:04:42.444
<v Speaker 5>they're extraordinarily productive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They make lots of new businesses and </v>

1187
01:04:44.821 --> 01:04:47.970
<v Speaker 5>then they pump money like back,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like mad back in India.</v>

1188
01:04:48.210 --> 01:04:50.360
<v Speaker 5>Good deal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that doesn't mean that we have,</v>

1189
01:04:50.390 --> 01:04:51.090
<v Speaker 5>we have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1190
01:04:51.090 --> 01:04:54.600
<v Speaker 5>our arms are open to everyone </v>
<v Speaker 5>immigration policy because it's complete</v>

1191
01:04:54.601 --> 01:04:55.434
<v Speaker 5>rubbish.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All that means is you're not thinking </v>

1192
01:04:56.671 --> 01:04:57.840
<v Speaker 5>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So when it,</v>

1193
01:04:57.841 --> 01:04:59.820
<v Speaker 5>here's a coded to that for </v>
<v Speaker 5>conservatives,</v>

1194
01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:03.240
<v Speaker 5>here's something I've been thinking </v>
<v Speaker 5>about this a lot lately.</v>

1195
01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:04.613
<v Speaker 5>It should not be assumed that citizens </v>
<v Speaker 5>of societies that have not evolved </v>

1196
01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:12.590
<v Speaker 5>functional individual rights predicated </v>
<v Speaker 5>Paulie.</v>

1197
01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:15.060
<v Speaker 5>These will hold values in keeping with </v>
<v Speaker 5>such polities.</v>

1198
01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:16.440
<v Speaker 5>So we could say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

1199
01:05:20.110 --> 01:05:22.840
<v Speaker 5>there are a lot of countries in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>world that are not governed well,</v>

1200
01:05:23.140 --> 01:05:24.910
<v Speaker 5>the vast majority of them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1201
01:05:25.030 --> 01:05:25.863
<v Speaker 5>And they'd be not governed well forever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And to me that means that there's </v>

1202
01:05:29.921 --> 01:05:30.754
<v Speaker 5>something wrong with the values that are</v>
<v Speaker 5>held collectively by the people who've </v>

1203
01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:36.490
<v Speaker 5>established those polarities.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1204
01:05:36.670 --> 01:05:37.503
<v Speaker 5>you shouldn't be naive and assume that </v>
<v Speaker 5>merely because you moved them to a new </v>

1205
01:05:40.361 --> 01:05:41.194
<v Speaker 5>country,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're going to let their innate </v>

1206
01:05:42.700 --> 01:05:46.720
<v Speaker 5>democratic longings flourish.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't work that way.</v>

1207
01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:53.610
<v Speaker 5>So if you stand up and say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

1208
01:05:53.611 --> 01:05:55.890
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's be a little cautious.</v>

1209
01:05:56.130 --> 01:06:00.780
<v Speaker 5>Let's make sure that we don't transform </v>
<v Speaker 5>our society so rapidly that we lose what</v>

1210
01:06:00.781 --> 01:06:02.820
<v Speaker 5>we have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's be careful about that.</v>

1211
01:06:02.970 --> 01:06:06.570
<v Speaker 5>That doesn't mean that you're a morally </v>
<v Speaker 5>reprehensible demon.</v>

1212
01:06:06.750 --> 01:06:11.670
<v Speaker 5>It just means that you're conservative </v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's a reasonable position to hold.</v>

1213
01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:14.370
<v Speaker 5>So there's no sense in Nepal dicing to </v>
<v Speaker 5>it for it.</v>

1214
01:06:14.490 --> 01:06:15.323
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that doesn't mean you get to like hide </v>

1215
01:06:17.491 --> 01:06:20.220
<v Speaker 5>your bigotry under a mask of moral </v>
<v Speaker 5>virtue.</v>

1216
01:06:20.221 --> 01:06:24.120
<v Speaker 5>You know the discrimination issue is </v>
<v Speaker 5>quite clear as far as I'm concerned.</v>

1217
01:06:24.121 --> 01:06:24.954
<v Speaker 5>So that's associated with bigotry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you have two people who are applying </v>

1218
01:06:28.831 --> 01:06:29.664
<v Speaker 5>for a job,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you should pick the one that's most </v>

1219
01:06:31.291 --> 01:06:32.124
<v Speaker 5>qualified and not pay any attention to </v>
<v Speaker 5>any of the other attributes of the </v>

1220
01:06:35.491 --> 01:06:37.830
<v Speaker 5>person that have nothing to do with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>job.</v>

1221
01:06:38.100 --> 01:06:38.933
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1222
01:06:42.390 --> 01:06:44.940
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think basically,</v>

1223
01:06:44.941 --> 01:06:49.941
<v Speaker 5>I think we figured that out in about </v>
<v Speaker 5>1965 now we're not doing it perfectly,</v>

1224
01:06:50.101 --> 01:06:50.934
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's not that much later than 1965 </v>

1225
01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:56.610
<v Speaker 5>and our society particularly in Canada </v>
<v Speaker 5>is pretty damn open.</v>

1226
01:06:56.790 --> 01:06:57.623
<v Speaker 5>You can come in here and if you work </v>
<v Speaker 5>hard and if you're fortunate you don't </v>

1227
01:06:59.941 --> 01:07:02.700
<v Speaker 5>get sick and God smiles on you so to </v>
<v Speaker 5>speak,</v>

1228
01:07:02.850 --> 01:07:05.340
<v Speaker 5>you can be successful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's still prejudice,</v>

1229
01:07:05.341 --> 01:07:07.350
<v Speaker 5>unreasonable prejudice and </v>
<v Speaker 5>discrimination,</v>

1230
01:07:07.351 --> 01:07:08.184
<v Speaker 5>but our society is not as the radical </v>
<v Speaker 5>egalitarian equity promoters have it </v>

1231
01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:15.120
<v Speaker 5>structurally racist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bigoted,</v>

1232
01:07:15.121 --> 01:07:17.220
<v Speaker 5>and misogynistic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1233
01:07:17.340 --> 01:07:19.050
<v Speaker 5>not only that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just so you know,</v>

1234
01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:19.993
<v Speaker 5>there is a review.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was a recent review published and </v>

1235
01:07:21.421 --> 01:07:22.254
<v Speaker 5>I mean recent 2017 looking at that damn </v>
<v Speaker 5>literature on unconscious bias and I </v>

1236
01:07:26.671 --> 01:07:27.504
<v Speaker 5>knew the literature to begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there is no evidence that unconscious </v>

1237
01:07:30.091 --> 01:07:33.600
<v Speaker 5>bias can be measured properly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not reliably.</v>

1238
01:07:33.690 --> 01:07:34.523
<v Speaker 5>There's also no evidence whatsoever that</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you do measure it and you can't very </v>

1239
01:07:37.531 --> 01:07:42.531
<v Speaker 5>well that it does any better job of </v>
<v Speaker 5>predicting actual say bias and,</v>

1240
01:07:43.201 --> 01:07:44.220
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>

1241
01:07:44.430 --> 01:07:46.980
<v Speaker 5>prejudice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then just tests of attitude.</v>

1242
01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:47.993
<v Speaker 5>So the notion that our culture is </v>
<v Speaker 5>somehow structurally misogynistic and </v>

1243
01:07:52.321 --> 01:07:53.154
<v Speaker 5>racist and the reason for that is </v>
<v Speaker 5>because of the unconscious bias of the </v>

1244
01:07:56.401 --> 01:07:59.610
<v Speaker 5>monsters who are running it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>

1245
01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.460
<v Speaker 5>well maybe it's not wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I can tell you one thing about it.</v>

1246
01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:03.413
<v Speaker 5>It is not a scientifically justifiable </v>
<v Speaker 5>proposition and that's what it's being </v>

1247
01:08:06.781 --> 01:08:07.614
<v Speaker 5>passed off as.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I placed that firmly at the feet of </v>

1248
01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:10.673
<v Speaker 5>the social psychologists with social </v>
<v Speaker 5>psychology happens to be a fairly </v>

1249
01:08:13.411 --> 01:08:14.730
<v Speaker 5>corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>disciplined by the way.</v>

1250
01:08:14.930 --> 01:08:16.280
<v Speaker 5>And the people who invented</v>

1251
01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:17.113
<v Speaker 4>the implicit association test,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which measures unconscious bias because </v>

1252
01:08:20.091 --> 01:08:20.924
<v Speaker 4>they have not come out publicly to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>degree that they should have been said </v>

1253
01:08:23.300 --> 01:08:26.060
<v Speaker 4>are test,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was for experimental purposes,</v>

1254
01:08:26.180 --> 01:08:30.410
<v Speaker 4>is being misused politically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know your damn judges now because of</v>

1255
01:08:30.411 --> 01:08:31.244
<v Speaker 4>federal five feet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>half to undergo mandatory unconscious </v>

1256
01:08:33.471 --> 01:08:35.630
<v Speaker 4>bias retraining before they can sit on </v>
<v Speaker 4>the bench.</v>

1257
01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:39.200
<v Speaker 4>And so you don't think that's political </v>
<v Speaker 4>reeducation is because you're not paying</v>

1258
01:08:39.201 --> 01:08:42.980
<v Speaker 4>attention and there's zero evidence that</v>
<v Speaker 4>it does what it's supposed to.</v>

1259
01:08:42.981 --> 01:08:44.570
<v Speaker 4>And I would also recommend to all of </v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1260
01:08:44.900 --> 01:08:45.733
<v Speaker 4>if you happen to be in a workplace that </v>
<v Speaker 4>introduces diversity training or </v>

1261
01:08:48.681 --> 01:08:53.000
<v Speaker 4>unconscious bias training as a mandatory</v>
<v Speaker 4>requirement,</v>

1262
01:08:53.300 --> 01:08:55.310
<v Speaker 4>you tell them and knows it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no uncertain terms,</v>

1263
01:08:55.311 --> 01:08:56.144
<v Speaker 4>that you are not participating in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>process that deems you bigoted and </v>

1264
01:08:59.361 --> 01:09:02.240
<v Speaker 4>misogynistic without evidence of that </v>
<v Speaker 4>being the case.</v>

1265
01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:03.253
<v Speaker 4>And if you trot off to the training,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you've just agreed that that's who </v>

1266
01:09:05.931 --> 01:09:07.310
<v Speaker 4>you are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And believe me,</v>

1267
01:09:07.311 --> 01:09:08.144
<v Speaker 4>once you've agreed to that man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll be agreeing to take a bunch of </v>

1268
01:09:09.981 --> 01:09:11.840
<v Speaker 4>things you don't want to agree soon </v>
<v Speaker 4>afterwards.</v>

1269
01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:15.320
<v Speaker 4>So it's time just to put a stop to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Enough of that,</v>

1270
01:09:15.590 --> 01:09:19.820
<v Speaker 4>none of that unconscious bias retreading</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially not the mandatory type.</v>

1271
01:09:29.050 --> 01:09:29.883
<v Speaker 5>People should be paid so that they are </v>
<v Speaker 5>able and willing to perform socially </v>

1272
01:09:32.531 --> 01:09:35.110
<v Speaker 5>useful and desirable duties.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

1273
01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:39.220
<v Speaker 5>so the radical leftists,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they react to me this way.</v>

1274
01:09:39.370 --> 01:09:40.121
<v Speaker 5>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1275
01:09:40.121 --> 01:09:44.830
<v Speaker 5>you hold a position of privilege and </v>
<v Speaker 5>power and I think first you don't know a</v>

1276
01:09:44.831 --> 01:09:45.664
<v Speaker 5>goddamn thing about me and you have no </v>
<v Speaker 5>idea how I got to my position of </v>

1277
01:09:48.221 --> 01:09:50.310
<v Speaker 5>privilege and power and it was no </v>
<v Speaker 5>birthright.</v>

1278
01:09:50.380 --> 01:09:51.213
<v Speaker 5>I can tell you that I was a small,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like thick glassed intellectual </v>

1279
01:09:57.020 --> 01:10:00.220
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do you call that Athletic Child?</v>

1280
01:10:00.221 --> 01:10:01.810
<v Speaker 5>You'd always a year younger than my </v>
<v Speaker 5>peers.</v>

1281
01:10:01.990 --> 01:10:05.320
<v Speaker 5>I suffered plenty of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what would you say?</v>

1282
01:10:05.590 --> 01:10:09.160
<v Speaker 5>Trouble for my loud mouth and my </v>
<v Speaker 5>intellect when I was growing up.</v>

1283
01:10:09.161 --> 01:10:10.600
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had my struggles.</v>

1284
01:10:10.601 --> 01:10:15.460
<v Speaker 5>I'm not complaining about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The point is is that you can't attribute</v>

1285
01:10:15.461 --> 01:10:18.310
<v Speaker 5>privileged to a class of people and no </v>
<v Speaker 5>one,</v>

1286
01:10:18.311 --> 01:10:19.144
<v Speaker 5>you can't attribute power to people who </v>
<v Speaker 5>happened to occupy a position of </v>

1287
01:10:21.461 --> 01:10:22.960
<v Speaker 5>competence and authority either.</v>

1288
01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:23.913
<v Speaker 5>There's some possibility that they </v>
<v Speaker 5>occupied that because they worked hard </v>

1289
01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:29.500
<v Speaker 5>and were fortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's not forget about that and had some</v>

1290
01:10:29.501 --> 01:10:32.770
<v Speaker 5>good social support and didn't have some</v>
<v Speaker 5>horrible disease,</v>

1291
01:10:32.771 --> 01:10:33.604
<v Speaker 5>thank God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you can't just make the case that </v>

1292
01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:38.553
<v Speaker 5>the position is there as a reward.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not there as far as a reward at </v>

1293
01:10:41.471 --> 01:10:42.304
<v Speaker 5>all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's there as a consequence of the </v>

1294
01:10:43.751 --> 01:10:47.530
<v Speaker 5>person offering something valuable to </v>
<v Speaker 5>those who want to pay for it.</v>

1295
01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:50.110
<v Speaker 5>And the reason you pay for them isn't to</v>
<v Speaker 5>reward them.</v>

1296
01:10:50.410 --> 01:10:52.270
<v Speaker 5>It isn't so that you give them a pat on </v>
<v Speaker 5>the back and say,</v>

1297
01:10:52.271 --> 01:10:53.104
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're a good person and you know you </v>

1298
01:10:54.011 --> 01:10:56.260
<v Speaker 5>deserve this position.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's because you're saying to them,</v>

1299
01:10:56.680 --> 01:11:00.130
<v Speaker 5>produce.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We find what you're producing a value.</v>

1300
01:11:00.430 --> 01:11:01.263
<v Speaker 5>And so we're going to give you what you </v>
<v Speaker 5>need in order to be motivated to keep </v>

1301
01:11:03.371 --> 01:11:05.020
<v Speaker 5>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's not because we like cue.</v>

1302
01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:07.240
<v Speaker 5>It's not because we re we respect your </v>
<v Speaker 5>rights.</v>

1303
01:11:07.241 --> 01:11:08.830
<v Speaker 5>It has nothing to do with equity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

1304
01:11:08.831 --> 01:11:09.664
<v Speaker 5>we're trying to get every God damn thing</v>
<v Speaker 5>we can from you as fast as possible and </v>

1305
01:11:12.161 --> 01:11:15.360
<v Speaker 5>we're going to pay you to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so people deserve their damn pay.</v>

1306
01:11:15.540 --> 01:11:17.880
<v Speaker 5>And the reason they deserve it isn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>because it's a reward.</v>

1307
01:11:18.150 --> 01:11:18.983
<v Speaker 5>It's because that's how you get </v>
<v Speaker 5>productive people to do things that are </v>

1308
01:11:21.961 --> 01:11:22.794
<v Speaker 5>difficult and time consuming.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that perhaps they wouldn't do on </v>

1309
01:11:25.231 --> 01:11:28.950
<v Speaker 5>their own accord to continue doing them </v>
<v Speaker 5>so you can benefit from it.</v>

1310
01:11:29.430 --> 01:11:31.620
<v Speaker 5>So the whole notion that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1311
01:11:31.770 --> 01:11:34.590
<v Speaker 5>we're awarding positions of privilege,</v>
<v Speaker 5>too,</v>

1312
01:11:34.710 --> 01:11:35.543
<v Speaker 5>oppressive patriarchal types,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like we just have to get rid of </v>

1313
01:11:37.951 --> 01:11:38.780
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Enough of that.</v>

1314
01:11:38.780 --> 01:11:40.050
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's nonsense.</v>

1315
01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:42.210
<v Speaker 5>It's absolute nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the other thing too is,</v>

1316
01:11:42.211 --> 01:11:44.820
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's only been 30 40 years,</v>

1317
01:11:45.030 --> 01:11:47.850
<v Speaker 5>50 years since women had reliable birth </v>
<v Speaker 5>control.</v>

1318
01:11:47.850 --> 01:11:49.920
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And we're able to enter the workforce on</v>

1319
01:11:49.921 --> 01:11:51.000
<v Speaker 5>Mohs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll tell you,</v>

1320
01:11:51.001 --> 01:11:51.834
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we've produced a cultural revolution in </v>

1321
01:11:53.251 --> 01:11:55.650
<v Speaker 5>like 50 years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Women are everywhere.</v>

1322
01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:58.740
<v Speaker 5>It's like how bloody fast do you expect </v>
<v Speaker 5>something like that to go?</v>

1323
01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:00.990
<v Speaker 5>And what makes you think that pushing it</v>
<v Speaker 5>really hard,</v>

1324
01:12:00.991 --> 01:12:02.760
<v Speaker 5>he's going to make it go any better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1325
01:12:02.761 --> 01:12:03.594
<v Speaker 5>as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we manage that transition about as well </v>

1326
01:12:05.371 --> 01:12:08.340
<v Speaker 5>as we possibly could have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're still sorting out the details,</v>

1327
01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:12.330
<v Speaker 5>but the fact that you know this is </v>
<v Speaker 5>coming very rapidly down the pipes.</v>

1328
01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:13.313
<v Speaker 5>The fact that half of our corporate </v>
<v Speaker 5>board members are women is not </v>

1329
01:12:16.711 --> 01:12:20.640
<v Speaker 5>indicative of the fact that we live in </v>
<v Speaker 5>an unconsciously biased,</v>

1330
01:12:20.641 --> 01:12:22.920
<v Speaker 5>misogynistic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>patriarchal society.</v>

1331
01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:24.450
<v Speaker 5>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wrong,</v>

1332
01:12:24.660 --> 01:12:27.420
<v Speaker 5>not correct and so we shouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 5>allowing,</v>

1333
01:12:27.421 --> 01:12:28.254
<v Speaker 5>and this is happening very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very rapidly and you can be sure </v>

1334
01:12:30.091 --> 01:12:30.924
<v Speaker 5>Kathleen Wynne is going to be putting </v>
<v Speaker 5>this in as policies rapidly as she </v>

1335
01:12:33.031 --> 01:12:33.864
<v Speaker 5>possibly can.</v>

1336
01:12:33.990 --> 01:12:34.823
<v Speaker 5>These equity demands to ensure that </v>
<v Speaker 5>there's proportional representation of </v>

1337
01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:39.510
<v Speaker 5>every gender,</v>
<v Speaker 5>every sex,</v>

1338
01:12:39.511 --> 01:12:40.344
<v Speaker 5>every race,</v>
<v Speaker 5>every ethnicity at every level of every </v>

1339
01:12:42.421 --> 01:12:43.680
<v Speaker 5>organization.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

1340
01:12:43.740 --> 01:12:44.573
<v Speaker 5>really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're going to do that by governmental </v>

1341
01:12:45.751 --> 01:12:46.770
<v Speaker 5>Fiat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

1342
01:12:46.771 --> 01:12:49.650
<v Speaker 5>that's not as society I want to live in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I tell you and I can,</v>

1343
01:12:49.770 --> 01:12:54.770
<v Speaker 5>I can I quite certain that if you lived </v>
<v Speaker 5>in that society for any length of time,</v>

1344
01:12:55.050 --> 01:12:58.170
<v Speaker 5>you'd learn very rapidly that it isn't a</v>
<v Speaker 5>society that you'd want to be part of.</v>

1345
01:12:58.171 --> 01:12:59.004
<v Speaker 5>Either</v>
<v Speaker 5>citizens have the inalienable right to </v>

1346
01:13:02.521 --> 01:13:05.070
<v Speaker 5>benefit from the results of their own </v>
<v Speaker 5>owners labor.</v>

1347
01:13:05.220 --> 01:13:06.990
<v Speaker 5>That's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

1348
01:13:07.170 --> 01:13:10.470
<v Speaker 5>that's a conservative truism.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know why,</v>

1349
01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:13.980
<v Speaker 5>what isn't because you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because you're good,</v>

1350
01:13:13.981 --> 01:13:14.814
<v Speaker 5>harder than you want them to have money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's because they'll work if you let </v>

1351
01:13:18.991 --> 01:13:19.824
<v Speaker 5>them benefit from the work and you want </v>
<v Speaker 5>them to work because if they work then </v>

1352
01:13:21.811 --> 01:13:23.190
<v Speaker 5>they do things that you need.</v>

1353
01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:24.233
<v Speaker 5>It's as simple as that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's self interest and it's the right </v>

1354
01:13:26.221 --> 01:13:28.560
<v Speaker 5>kind of self interest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if you work hard,</v>

1355
01:13:28.561 --> 01:13:30.240
<v Speaker 5>it's like great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have your money.</v>

1356
01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:33.450
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you hear people all the time talking</v>

1357
01:13:33.451 --> 01:13:36.780
<v Speaker 5>about how corrupt our society is and how</v>
<v Speaker 5>the 1% you know,</v>

1358
01:13:36.781 --> 01:13:39.090
<v Speaker 5>occupies this pinnacle position.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1359
01:13:39.091 --> 01:13:42.000
<v Speaker 5>the 1% turns over pretty damn fast just </v>
<v Speaker 5>so you know it.</v>

1360
01:13:42.210 --> 01:13:46.920
<v Speaker 5>So you have about a 10% chance of </v>
<v Speaker 5>spending at least one year in the top 1%</v>

1361
01:13:46.921 --> 01:13:49.140
<v Speaker 5>chance during your life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's right.</v>

1362
01:13:49.141 --> 01:13:51.090
<v Speaker 5>I think it's 10% it might be higher than</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

1363
01:13:51.390 --> 01:13:55.200
<v Speaker 5>but it's fast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the 1% is stable as a phenomenon,</v>

1364
01:13:55.230 --> 01:13:56.063
<v Speaker 5>but it turns over very rapidly in terms </v>
<v Speaker 5>of who occupies it and it's the same in </v>

1365
01:13:58.891 --> 01:13:59.724
<v Speaker 5>every society.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The wealth is always distributed </v>

1366
01:14:02.070 --> 01:14:04.110
<v Speaker 5>inequitably.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a natural law.</v>

1367
01:14:04.111 --> 01:14:05.000
<v Speaker 5>You can look it up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It,</v>

1368
01:14:05.150 --> 01:14:05.983
<v Speaker 5>it was discovered by a guy named Wilfred</v>
<v Speaker 5>Prieto back in the late 18 hundreds </v>

1369
01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:12.280
<v Speaker 5>goods tend to diminish to distribute </v>
<v Speaker 5>inequitably.</v>

1370
01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:13.233
<v Speaker 5>It can be a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it doesn't mean that there's </v>

1371
01:14:14.561 --> 01:14:15.394
<v Speaker 5>something fundamentally corrupt about </v>
<v Speaker 5>the social structure that's driving it </v>

1372
01:14:17.891 --> 01:14:19.930
<v Speaker 5>in that direction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you,</v>

1373
01:14:20.110 --> 01:14:24.760
<v Speaker 5>you don't want some filthy rich geniuses</v>
<v Speaker 5>lying around like maybe you do.</v>

1374
01:14:24.761 --> 01:14:26.950
<v Speaker 5>Let me look at what he learned.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Musk is doing for God's sake.</v>

1375
01:14:26.951 --> 01:14:29.350
<v Speaker 5>Maybe he should have 10 times as much </v>
<v Speaker 5>money as he has.</v>

1376
01:14:29.530 --> 01:14:33.430
<v Speaker 5>He's going to launch a rocket every five</v>
<v Speaker 5>days to Mars in the next 10 years,</v>

1377
01:14:33.670 --> 01:14:34.503
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He wants to wipe out fossil fuel cars </v>

1378
01:14:37.150 --> 01:14:37.983
<v Speaker 5>and he might do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He wants to revolutionize the </v>

1379
01:14:39.641 --> 01:14:41.800
<v Speaker 5>transportation system and he might do </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

1380
01:14:41.950 --> 01:14:45.310
<v Speaker 5>He wants to put us on the damn solar </v>
<v Speaker 5>grid with his new batteries and he might</v>

1381
01:14:45.311 --> 01:14:46.120
<v Speaker 5>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

1382
01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:48.280
<v Speaker 5>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he has a couple of billion dollars.</v>

1383
01:14:48.281 --> 01:14:50.710
<v Speaker 5>Well God only knows what he's going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>produce with that.</v>

1384
01:14:50.980 --> 01:14:51.813
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so obviously there's going to be some </v>

1385
01:14:53.591 --> 01:14:54.424
<v Speaker 5>corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's to be some corrupt rich </v>

1386
01:14:57.010 --> 01:15:00.310
<v Speaker 5>plutocrats who do nothing but smoke </v>
<v Speaker 5>cigars and snort cocaine.</v>

1387
01:15:00.430 --> 01:15:01.990
<v Speaker 5>They're not gonna live very long </v>
<v Speaker 5>anyways.</v>

1388
01:15:02.140 --> 01:15:02.973
<v Speaker 5>But there's lots of people out there who</v>
<v Speaker 5>have the money they have because they </v>

1389
01:15:05.591 --> 01:15:08.050
<v Speaker 5>would really like to do interesting and </v>
<v Speaker 5>creative things with it.</v>

1390
01:15:08.051 --> 01:15:10.900
<v Speaker 5>Not because they're interested in </v>
<v Speaker 5>gathering more,</v>

1391
01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:11.913
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>paper money to stuff in their mattress </v>

1392
01:15:13.661 --> 01:15:16.840
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and to like to feel the smooth,</v>

1393
01:15:17.020 --> 01:15:20.890
<v Speaker 5>the smooth delight of gold coins between</v>
<v Speaker 5>their fingers before they go to bed.</v>

1394
01:15:20.891 --> 01:15:21.724
<v Speaker 5>Like what kind of attitude is that </v>
<v Speaker 5>towards people who've made their </v>

1395
01:15:24.611 --> 01:15:25.780
<v Speaker 5>fortune?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1396
01:15:25.781 --> 01:15:29.200
<v Speaker 5>you think that about Steve Jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you think that about Bill Gates.</v>

1397
01:15:29.380 --> 01:15:30.191
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>good God,</v>

1398
01:15:30.191 --> 01:15:31.840
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how those people may,</v>
<v Speaker 5>lot of money,</v>

1399
01:15:31.841 --> 01:15:34.390
<v Speaker 5>but man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>thank God they were around,</v>

1400
01:15:34.391 --> 01:15:35.224
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they've given us some tools that are </v>

1401
01:15:36.191 --> 01:15:38.860
<v Speaker 5>just absolutely unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

1402
01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:41.200
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe we could leave the jealousy of the</v>

1403
01:15:41.201 --> 01:15:45.220
<v Speaker 5>successful behind for a while and notice</v>
<v Speaker 5>now and then that some of the people who</v>

1404
01:15:45.221 --> 01:15:46.054
<v Speaker 5>got to where they are actually deserve </v>
<v Speaker 5>to get to where they are and we should </v>

1405
01:15:48.671 --> 01:15:50.170
<v Speaker 5>be thankful that they exist.</v>

1406
01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:51.153
<v Speaker 5>That would be nice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A little gratitude and that's a good </v>

1407
01:15:53.351 --> 01:15:54.184
<v Speaker 5>conservative value to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is more noble to teach young people </v>

1408
01:15:58.271 --> 01:16:00.700
<v Speaker 5>about responsibilities then about </v>
<v Speaker 5>rights.</v>

1409
01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:03.940
<v Speaker 5>That's a good conservative message.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like you have his son,</v>

1410
01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:08.680
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or you have a daughter and you say,</v>

1411
01:16:08.681 --> 01:16:09.514
<v Speaker 5>bloody well grow up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Stand on your own two feet and make </v>

1412
01:16:11.201 --> 01:16:14.560
<v Speaker 5>something of yourself right so that I </v>
<v Speaker 5>can be proud of you when you come over.</v>

1413
01:16:14.710 --> 01:16:16.690
<v Speaker 5>And so that may be your useful in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>crisis.</v>

1414
01:16:16.990 --> 01:16:17.823
<v Speaker 5>It's like pick up your damn load and </v>
<v Speaker 5>Mandy and shoulder it and do something </v>

1415
01:16:22.241 --> 01:16:23.074
<v Speaker 5>useful and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and forget about your damn rights for </v>

1416
01:16:25.331 --> 01:16:26.164
<v Speaker 5>awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can think about what it is that you </v>

1417
01:16:27.671 --> 01:16:28.504
<v Speaker 5>should be doing to benefit yourself and </v>
<v Speaker 5>your family and society and you'll find </v>

1418
01:16:31.631 --> 01:16:33.340
<v Speaker 5>some purpose in your life because of </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

1419
01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:34.473
<v Speaker 5>And so well that's a counter position to</v>
<v Speaker 5>the perpetrators of the endless rights </v>

1420
01:16:38.770 --> 01:16:40.090
<v Speaker 5>buffet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1421
01:16:40.270 --> 01:16:42.040
<v Speaker 5>Well as long as we give you enough </v>
<v Speaker 5>rights,</v>

1422
01:16:42.041 --> 01:16:43.450
<v Speaker 5>you're going to be what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Free.</v>

1423
01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:44.950
<v Speaker 5>You're going to be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

1424
01:16:44.951 --> 01:16:45.784
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sure you'll drown in a sea of chaos and </v>

1425
01:16:47.651 --> 01:16:49.420
<v Speaker 5>that's what's happening to people now </v>
<v Speaker 5>too.</v>

1426
01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:50.673
<v Speaker 5>So and that's why young people are so </v>
<v Speaker 5>hungry to have someone talk to them </v>

1427
01:16:52.691 --> 01:16:56.260
<v Speaker 5>about responsibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here's another one.</v>

1428
01:16:56.560 --> 01:16:59.290
<v Speaker 5>Radical change should be viewed with </v>
<v Speaker 5>suspicion,</v>

1429
01:16:59.980 --> 01:17:02.380
<v Speaker 5>particularly in a time of radical </v>
<v Speaker 5>change.</v>

1430
01:17:02.650 --> 01:17:05.770
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's never been a time in the history</v>

1431
01:17:05.771 --> 01:17:09.260
<v Speaker 5>of the world where things are changing </v>
<v Speaker 5>as fast as they are now and not only are</v>

1432
01:17:09.261 --> 01:17:10.094
<v Speaker 5>they changing fast,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the rate at which they're changing is </v>

1433
01:17:12.231 --> 01:17:16.700
<v Speaker 5>increasing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like we're moving fast forward at such a</v>

1434
01:17:16.701 --> 01:17:19.520
<v Speaker 5>rate that it's unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't even keep up.</v>

1435
01:17:19.521 --> 01:17:20.354
<v Speaker 5>I don't care what discipline you're in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like it's not so bad to have some </v>

1436
01:17:22.821 --> 01:17:26.660
<v Speaker 5>people putting their feet in the ground </v>
<v Speaker 5>are digging their heels in and say,</v>

1437
01:17:26.661 --> 01:17:29.090
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we got a lot to swallow already.</v>

1438
01:17:29.090 --> 01:17:29.923
<v Speaker 5>We got a lot to chew on and Digest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's not muck about with everything </v>

1439
01:17:32.811 --> 01:17:34.790
<v Speaker 5>that's worked so far,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what has worked.</v>

1440
01:17:35.690 --> 01:17:40.690
<v Speaker 5>It's not such a bad idea for people to </v>
<v Speaker 5>have long term families,</v>

1441
01:17:40.821 --> 01:17:41.870
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We could say,</v>

1442
01:17:41.871 --> 01:17:44.480
<v Speaker 5>let's try to support the family.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We can even say,</v>

1443
01:17:44.481 --> 01:17:46.670
<v Speaker 5>let's try to support the traditional </v>
<v Speaker 5>family.</v>

1444
01:17:46.790 --> 01:17:48.020
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1445
01:17:48.290 --> 01:17:51.440
<v Speaker 5>maybe boys and girls need role models of</v>
<v Speaker 5>each sex.</v>

1446
01:17:51.441 --> 01:17:54.260
<v Speaker 5>I know that's a terrible thing to say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it is possible.</v>

1447
01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:55.273
<v Speaker 5>It's certainly the case too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that intact two parent families have </v>

1448
01:17:58.971 --> 01:17:59.804
<v Speaker 5>children that thrive more than broken </v>
<v Speaker 5>families and broken families or a </v>

1449
01:18:03.141 --> 01:18:05.120
<v Speaker 5>catastrophe or for everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now you might say,</v>

1450
01:18:05.121 --> 01:18:05.954
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I shouldn't stay with someone that I </v>

1451
01:18:07.071 --> 01:18:08.450
<v Speaker 5>don't get along with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's like,</v>

1452
01:18:08.540 --> 01:18:09.021
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1453
01:18:09.021 --> 01:18:09.854
<v Speaker 5>fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Except that there's no one that you're </v>

1454
01:18:11.151 --> 01:18:11.984
<v Speaker 5>ever going to find to stay with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going to get along with all of </v>

1455
01:18:13.821 --> 01:18:16.430
<v Speaker 5>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially in your shotty condition,</v>

1456
01:18:16.620 --> 01:18:18.150
<v Speaker 5>and so you're lucky that anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1457
01:18:18.770 --> 01:18:21.110
<v Speaker 5>you're lucky that anybody will put up </v>
<v Speaker 5>with you for a week,</v>

1458
01:18:21.111 --> 01:18:22.460
<v Speaker 5>much less your whole life.</v>

1459
01:18:22.670 --> 01:18:25.160
<v Speaker 5>It's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the point of marriage is to tough it out</v>

1460
01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:27.380
<v Speaker 5>and you don't tough it out for your </v>
<v Speaker 5>happiness.</v>

1461
01:18:27.530 --> 01:18:28.363
<v Speaker 5>That's not what you're in there for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your tough it out so that you have </v>

1462
01:18:30.471 --> 01:18:33.770
<v Speaker 5>someone to tie the rope of your life </v>
<v Speaker 5>together with them.</v>

1463
01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:34.633
<v Speaker 5>You have a chance to tie the rope of </v>
<v Speaker 5>your life together with the rope of </v>

1464
01:18:37.011 --> 01:18:37.844
<v Speaker 5>someone else's life and to make it </v>
<v Speaker 5>strong and to make a place the children </v>

1465
01:18:40.731 --> 01:18:41.564
<v Speaker 5>can have some security and some </v>
<v Speaker 5>encouragement and thereby contribute to </v>

1466
01:18:45.141 --> 01:18:49.160
<v Speaker 5>the future and pay for the miracle of </v>
<v Speaker 5>your birth and your own raising.</v>

1467
01:18:49.190 --> 01:18:52.640
<v Speaker 5>That's why you get married.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there's no reason that conservatives</v>

1468
01:18:52.641 --> 01:18:54.020
<v Speaker 5>can't stand up and say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

1469
01:18:54.230 --> 01:18:57.350
<v Speaker 5>we're willing to tolerate alternative </v>
<v Speaker 5>family arrangements.</v>

1470
01:18:57.500 --> 01:18:58.333
<v Speaker 5>But when you start making the claim that</v>
<v Speaker 5>the traditional family unit is just </v>

1471
01:19:02.151 --> 01:19:06.080
<v Speaker 5>another construct and that it's not </v>
<v Speaker 5>something fundamental to our polity,</v>

1472
01:19:06.081 --> 01:19:09.230
<v Speaker 5>it's like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've taken your damn argument too far.</v>

1473
01:19:09.410 --> 01:19:11.960
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have no evidence whatsoever for that</v>

1474
01:19:11.961 --> 01:19:14.090
<v Speaker 5>claim and there's plenty of counter </v>
<v Speaker 5>evidence.</v>

1475
01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:15.073
<v Speaker 5>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the things the postmodernists </v>

1476
01:19:16.701 --> 01:19:18.020
<v Speaker 5>basically say us,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1477
01:19:18.021 --> 01:19:21.050
<v Speaker 5>every time you stand up for something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're also standing against something.</v>

1478
01:19:21.051 --> 01:19:22.100
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1479
01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:24.680
<v Speaker 5>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that doesn't mean that you shouldn't</v>

1480
01:19:24.681 --> 01:19:26.950
<v Speaker 5>stand up for things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think if we,</v>

1481
01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:29.030
<v Speaker 5>if we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if there is something that conservatives</v>

1482
01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:31.310
<v Speaker 5>could agree on that we could stand up </v>
<v Speaker 5>for,</v>

1483
01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:34.640
<v Speaker 5>it's the nuclear family now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Exactly how that's gonna play out.</v>

1484
01:19:34.641 --> 01:19:37.220
<v Speaker 5>I don't exactly know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's nothing too,</v>

1485
01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:39.680
<v Speaker 5>it's not anything to be ashamed of to </v>
<v Speaker 5>say,</v>

1486
01:19:39.860 --> 01:19:40.693
<v Speaker 5>well it kind of looks like that </v>
<v Speaker 5>structures work quite well for the </v>

1487
01:19:42.741 --> 01:19:46.730
<v Speaker 5>entire duration of mankind and so maybe </v>
<v Speaker 5>we mess with it at our peril.</v>

1488
01:19:53.910 --> 01:19:55.650
<v Speaker 5>Here's another one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The government,</v>

1489
01:19:55.710 --> 01:20:00.330
<v Speaker 5>local and distant should leave people to</v>
<v Speaker 5>their own devices as much as possible.</v>

1490
01:20:00.630 --> 01:20:02.040
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1491
01:20:02.100 --> 01:20:02.933
<v Speaker 5>part of it's just humility.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like I'd rather that there was a </v>

1492
01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:09.720
<v Speaker 5>million of you out there making own </v>
<v Speaker 5>stupid mistakes so that maybe a thousand</v>

1493
01:20:09.721 --> 01:20:14.721
<v Speaker 5>of you can get it right then for one of </v>
<v Speaker 5>you to impose their view on everyone and</v>

1494
01:20:15.421 --> 01:20:19.020
<v Speaker 5>risk getting it catastrophical he wrong </v>
<v Speaker 5>for everyone at the same time.</v>

1495
01:20:19.140 --> 01:20:22.110
<v Speaker 5>And that's really the alternative.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if you're a social scientist,</v>

1496
01:20:22.111 --> 01:20:24.930
<v Speaker 5>like I mean an actual scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't mean a bloody idiot log.</v>

1497
01:20:25.170 --> 01:20:27.090
<v Speaker 5>One of the things that you learned very </v>
<v Speaker 5>rapidly.</v>

1498
01:20:27.091 --> 01:20:29.160
<v Speaker 5>As you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you do a simple experiment.</v>

1499
01:20:29.161 --> 01:20:31.230
<v Speaker 5>You think you're going to predict some </v>
<v Speaker 5>element of human behavior,</v>

1500
01:20:31.231 --> 01:20:32.550
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so here's my hypothesis.</v>

1501
01:20:32.730 --> 01:20:33.563
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to put people in this </v>
<v Speaker 5>experimental situation and this is what </v>

1502
01:20:35.671 --> 01:20:38.130
<v Speaker 5>they're going to do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then you run the experiment and they</v>

1503
01:20:38.131 --> 01:20:38.964
<v Speaker 5>don't do that.</v>

1504
01:20:39.150 --> 01:20:39.983
<v Speaker 5>They do something completely different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You find out that even though what you </v>

1505
01:20:42.511 --> 01:20:43.344
<v Speaker 5>have them do is really simple,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't have a clue what they're up </v>

1506
01:20:46.051 --> 01:20:48.480
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's just a tiny little controlled</v>

1507
01:20:48.481 --> 01:20:51.810
<v Speaker 5>experiment about one little tiny thing </v>
<v Speaker 5>and you're wrong.</v>

1508
01:20:51.990 --> 01:20:52.823
<v Speaker 5>It's like</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the great advantages to </v>

1509
01:20:57.151 --> 01:21:00.690
<v Speaker 5>conservative philosophy is that it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>humble.</v>

1510
01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:02.033
<v Speaker 5>It's humble from,</v>
<v Speaker 5>from the perspective of social </v>

1511
01:21:04.021 --> 01:21:04.854
<v Speaker 5>experimentation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like it's not like everything's </v>

1512
01:21:06.841 --> 01:21:09.120
<v Speaker 5>great and we should just continue going </v>
<v Speaker 5>the way we're going.</v>

1513
01:21:09.270 --> 01:21:10.740
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1514
01:21:10.741 --> 01:21:11.574
<v Speaker 5>everything isn't as broken as it might </v>
<v Speaker 5>be and I'm kind of stupid and blind and </v>

1515
01:21:16.201 --> 01:21:20.250
<v Speaker 5>all I have is a bat and probably hitting</v>
<v Speaker 5>it isn't going to make it any better.</v>

1516
01:21:20.310 --> 01:21:24.840
<v Speaker 5>All do is shatter it and so the </v>
<v Speaker 5>conservative says it's working,</v>

1517
01:21:26.370 --> 01:21:28.680
<v Speaker 5>be quiet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sneak away.</v>

1518
01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:32.310
<v Speaker 5>Maybe it will keep working and that's a </v>
<v Speaker 5>perfectly reasonable perspective.</v>

1519
01:21:32.311 --> 01:21:34.290
<v Speaker 5>Now obviously sometimes things have to </v>
<v Speaker 5>change,</v>

1520
01:21:34.291 --> 01:21:36.270
<v Speaker 5>but the conservative can come up and </v>
<v Speaker 5>say,</v>

1521
01:21:36.450 --> 01:21:40.980
<v Speaker 5>don't be thinking that you have so much </v>
<v Speaker 5>evidence that what you're doing is right</v>

1522
01:21:41.010 --> 01:21:43.590
<v Speaker 5>or that it will have the outcome that </v>
<v Speaker 5>you expect it.</v>

1523
01:21:43.590 --> 01:21:44.423
<v Speaker 5>I'll tell you a quick story.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This was told to me by a woman named </v>

1524
01:21:45.991 --> 01:21:46.824
<v Speaker 5>Joan Mccord,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who was one of the world's first female </v>

1525
01:21:49.051 --> 01:21:50.070
<v Speaker 5>criminologist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by the way,</v>

1526
01:21:50.071 --> 01:21:52.620
<v Speaker 5>a phd from temple,</v>
<v Speaker 5>University of a genius level,</v>

1527
01:21:52.830 --> 01:21:56.160
<v Speaker 5>genius level person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Very tremendous integrity,</v>

1528
01:21:56.190 --> 01:21:57.000
<v Speaker 5>tough,</v>
<v Speaker 5>tough,</v>

1529
01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:57.833
<v Speaker 5>tough person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She did a study in a place called </v>

1530
01:21:59.491 --> 01:22:03.300
<v Speaker 5>Somerville in the United States in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Massachusetts in the 1930s famous study,</v>

1531
01:22:03.301 --> 01:22:04.134
<v Speaker 5>and so here is the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They'd identified a bunch of inner city </v>

1532
01:22:06.001 --> 01:22:07.900
<v Speaker 5>kids in rough neighborhoods and felt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1533
01:22:07.970 --> 01:22:10.140
<v Speaker 5>that they were more likely to be on a </v>
<v Speaker 5>criminal track,</v>

1534
01:22:10.350 --> 01:22:11.370
<v Speaker 5>criminal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>antisocial,</v>

1535
01:22:11.371 --> 01:22:13.290
<v Speaker 5>undereducated alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1536
01:22:13.291 --> 01:22:14.670
<v Speaker 5>the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the whole dismal,</v>

1537
01:22:14.820 --> 01:22:17.460
<v Speaker 5>wretched,</v>
<v Speaker 5>underclass phenomena thing was going on.</v>

1538
01:22:17.461 --> 01:22:18.300
<v Speaker 5>And so they thought,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1539
01:22:18.510 --> 01:22:22.110
<v Speaker 5>let's do an intervention.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's set up programs to help these kids</v>

1540
01:22:22.111 --> 01:22:26.250
<v Speaker 5>and see if we can see if we can change </v>
<v Speaker 5>their developmental pathway.</v>

1541
01:22:26.251 --> 01:22:27.084
<v Speaker 5>So</v>
<v Speaker 5>they designed to find study man and had </v>

1542
01:22:31.631 --> 01:22:33.720
<v Speaker 5>the kids,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll get the details wrong,</v>

1543
01:22:33.721 --> 01:22:35.730
<v Speaker 5>but I got the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got the story right.</v>

1544
01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:38.040
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they had the kids,</v>

1545
01:22:38.310 --> 01:22:39.143
<v Speaker 5>they made them more literate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they educated the more they had their </v>

1546
01:22:40.921 --> 01:22:43.890
<v Speaker 5>parents take training courses,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they did social skills training,</v>

1547
01:22:44.190 --> 01:22:48.630
<v Speaker 5>like they did all sorts of things to try</v>
<v Speaker 5>to make the kids' lives turn out better.</v>

1548
01:22:48.660 --> 01:22:49.493
<v Speaker 5>And to top it all off because the kids </v>
<v Speaker 5>were stuck in the inner city and they </v>

1549
01:22:53.011 --> 01:22:55.260
<v Speaker 5>took them all out to summer camp for a </v>
<v Speaker 5>couple of weeks a year.</v>

1550
01:22:55.710 --> 01:22:57.530
<v Speaker 5>And so they could get away from the city</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

1551
01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:00.600
<v Speaker 5>enjoy the countryside,</v>
<v Speaker 5>have a little bit of a vacation,</v>

1552
01:23:00.601 --> 01:23:02.760
<v Speaker 5>a little taste of a higher quality life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1553
01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:03.833
<v Speaker 5>So great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everyone's thrilled with the damn </v>

1554
01:23:04.900 --> 01:23:05.733
<v Speaker 5>program.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The kids are having a great time at </v>

1555
01:23:06.701 --> 01:23:07.534
<v Speaker 5>camp.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The counselors are thrilled to </v>

1556
01:23:08.381 --> 01:23:10.420
<v Speaker 5>psychologists.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They think they're doing a wonderful job</v>

1557
01:23:10.930 --> 01:23:12.550
<v Speaker 5>with great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's working beautifully,</v>

1558
01:23:12.610 --> 01:23:16.690
<v Speaker 5>except then they did the data analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Guess what happened?</v>

1559
01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:19.480
<v Speaker 5>The kids in the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in their treatment group,</v>

1560
01:23:19.481 --> 01:23:20.620
<v Speaker 5>there was a control group,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1561
01:23:20.621 --> 01:23:23.110
<v Speaker 5>That didn't get all this special </v>
<v Speaker 5>treatment randomly assigned.</v>

1562
01:23:23.111 --> 01:23:23.944
<v Speaker 5>It was a very nice experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The kids in the treatment group get </v>

1563
01:23:25.871 --> 01:23:29.840
<v Speaker 5>worse on virtually everything that was </v>
<v Speaker 5>measured worse.</v>

1564
01:23:30.710 --> 01:23:31.543
<v Speaker 5>Why</v>

1565
01:23:33.060 --> 01:23:33.893
<v Speaker 5>don't put anti social kids together in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the same camp for two weeks during the </v>

1566
01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:38.250
<v Speaker 5>year,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1567
01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:39.113
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because what happens is that the bad </v>

1568
01:23:40.111 --> 01:23:42.870
<v Speaker 5>kids teach the slightly less bad kids to</v>
<v Speaker 5>be worse.</v>

1569
01:23:43.140 --> 01:23:43.973
<v Speaker 5>It's a well documented phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why what happens in prisons </v>

1570
01:23:47.401 --> 01:23:48.234
<v Speaker 5>happens in prisons.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What we do with criminals is the worst </v>

1571
01:23:50.461 --> 01:23:53.790
<v Speaker 5>thing you could possibly do to criminals</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you don't want them to continue to be</v>

1572
01:23:53.791 --> 01:23:54.624
<v Speaker 5>criminals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>except for the fact that you keep them </v>

1573
01:23:55.831 --> 01:23:58.080
<v Speaker 5>in there until they're old enough,</v>
<v Speaker 5>generally speaking,</v>

1574
01:23:58.081 --> 01:24:00.210
<v Speaker 5>so they're less likely to engage in </v>
<v Speaker 5>criminal activity.</v>

1575
01:24:00.390 --> 01:24:01.223
<v Speaker 5>But what was learned from the Somerville</v>
<v Speaker 5>study was don't be so sure your good </v>

1576
01:24:03.841 --> 01:24:04.674
<v Speaker 5>intentions are going to produce the </v>
<v Speaker 5>results that you intend because they </v>

1577
01:24:06.811 --> 01:24:07.644
<v Speaker 5>probably won't and they probably won't </v>
<v Speaker 5>for reasons that you never even </v>

1578
01:24:09.751 --> 01:24:11.370
<v Speaker 5>imagined.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the other one was</v>

1579
01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:13.673
<v Speaker 5>don't group bad kids with good kids on </v>
<v Speaker 5>the assumption that the good kids will </v>

1580
01:24:16.861 --> 01:24:20.100
<v Speaker 5>make the bad kids better because that </v>
<v Speaker 5>isn't what happens.</v>

1581
01:24:20.250 --> 01:24:21.083
<v Speaker 5>What happens is the reverse.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you put two or three bad kids with a </v>

1582
01:24:24.151 --> 01:24:26.580
<v Speaker 5>bunch of good kids,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then the good kids get worse.</v>

1583
01:24:26.610 --> 01:24:27.443
<v Speaker 5>The bad kids don't get better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Very well documented social science </v>

1584
01:24:30.031 --> 01:24:30.631
<v Speaker 5>finding,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1585
01:24:30.631 --> 01:24:31.464
<v Speaker 5>the reason I'm telling you the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Somerville story is because God who </v>

1586
01:24:33.481 --> 01:24:34.890
<v Speaker 5>could argue with that study,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1587
01:24:34.891 --> 01:24:38.100
<v Speaker 5>It's like these kids were poor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they were struggling.</v>

1588
01:24:38.101 --> 01:24:40.050
<v Speaker 5>It's like you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you want to lift them up,</v>

1589
01:24:40.051 --> 01:24:42.720
<v Speaker 5>you want to make their life better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You do this wonderful,</v>

1590
01:24:42.780 --> 01:24:43.613
<v Speaker 5>expensive,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well motivated experiment and then you </v>

1591
01:24:46.351 --> 01:24:47.184
<v Speaker 5>run the damn data analysis and you find </v>
<v Speaker 5>out that there was one thing wrong with </v>

1592
01:24:49.381 --> 01:24:50.214
<v Speaker 5>your social intervention philosophy that</v>
<v Speaker 5>you didn't understand and you actually </v>

1593
01:24:53.251 --> 01:24:54.270
<v Speaker 5>made it worse.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1594
01:24:54.271 --> 01:24:55.910
<v Speaker 5>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so jo,</v>

1595
01:24:55.920 --> 01:24:56.753
<v Speaker 5>Joan Mccord,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she spent much of the rest of her life </v>

1596
01:24:58.320 --> 01:25:00.090
<v Speaker 5>going around telling social scientists.</v>

1597
01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:03.180
<v Speaker 5>When you run a social experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>politicians,</v>

1598
01:25:03.181 --> 01:25:05.430
<v Speaker 5>the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you run a social experiment,</v>

1599
01:25:05.431 --> 01:25:08.430
<v Speaker 5>especially on a large number of people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially without their consent,</v>

1600
01:25:08.850 --> 01:25:09.683
<v Speaker 5>then gather the data and do the followup</v>
<v Speaker 5>study because it's highly probable that </v>

1601
01:25:13.771 --> 01:25:16.230
<v Speaker 5>you'll find that what you did didn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>work.</v>

1602
01:25:16.231 --> 01:25:19.420
<v Speaker 5>Or maybe it even worked backwards and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you'll never know that unless you do the</v>

1603
01:25:19.421 --> 01:25:21.720
<v Speaker 5>study.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so what people took away from that,</v>

1604
01:25:21.930 --> 01:25:22.763
<v Speaker 5>the social intervention types took away </v>
<v Speaker 5>from that was whatever you do with your </v>

1605
01:25:26.551 --> 01:25:29.490
<v Speaker 5>social intervention policy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't run the study.</v>

1606
01:25:30.180 --> 01:25:31.440
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1607
01:25:31.470 --> 01:25:33.300
<v Speaker 5>That was the wrong lesson,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by the way.</v>

1608
01:25:34.170 --> 01:25:35.003
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And this is what I would close with for </v>

1609
01:25:36.241 --> 01:25:38.220
<v Speaker 5>the Conservatives.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is a nice one.</v>

1610
01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:39.270
<v Speaker 5>I really like this.</v>

1611
01:25:41.190 --> 01:25:42.023
<v Speaker 5>We hear a lot about the sins of the west</v>
<v Speaker 5>and there are manifold because people </v>

1612
01:25:45.511 --> 01:25:47.340
<v Speaker 5>are corrupt and our societies are </v>
<v Speaker 5>corrupt.</v>

1613
01:25:47.460 --> 01:25:48.293
<v Speaker 5>But you have to think about it in terms </v>
<v Speaker 5>of relative corruption rather than </v>

1614
01:25:50.341 --> 01:25:51.600
<v Speaker 5>absolute corruption.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

1615
01:25:51.870 --> 01:25:52.800
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1616
01:25:54.180 --> 01:25:58.230
<v Speaker 5>your family is not perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there are worse families compared to</v>

1617
01:25:58.231 --> 01:26:00.510
<v Speaker 5>the perfect family.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your family isn't looking so good,</v>

1618
01:26:00.540 --> 01:26:03.000
<v Speaker 5>but compared to other families,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe it's not looking so bad at,</v>

1619
01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:05.480
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so how do we judge our political system?</v>

1620
01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:09.560
<v Speaker 5>Well we don't judge it by the dreamlike </v>
<v Speaker 5>ill informed,</v>

1621
01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:10.513
<v Speaker 5>ideologically motivated pathological </v>
<v Speaker 5>utopias of the radical left or the </v>

1622
01:26:14.511 --> 01:26:15.344
<v Speaker 5>radical right for that matter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We saw what happened in the 20th </v>

1623
01:26:17.661 --> 01:26:18.740
<v Speaker 5>century.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you do that,</v>

1624
01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:20.930
<v Speaker 5>that is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very bad idea.</v>

1625
01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:22.033
<v Speaker 5>And you know there were tens of millions</v>
<v Speaker 5>of people that died in the 20th century </v>

1626
01:26:24.380 --> 01:26:27.260
<v Speaker 5>demonstrating just how bad an idea was </v>
<v Speaker 5>that was.</v>

1627
01:26:27.410 --> 01:26:29.180
<v Speaker 5>And you'd think we would have learned </v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

1628
01:26:29.390 --> 01:26:30.223
<v Speaker 5>but we didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What you do instead is you take a look </v>

1629
01:26:32.121 --> 01:26:33.770
<v Speaker 5>at your country and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1630
01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:37.100
<v Speaker 5>how is it doing compared to other </v>
<v Speaker 5>countries,</v>

1631
01:26:37.310 --> 01:26:38.143
<v Speaker 5>other actual real countries.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And maybe you look at a variety of </v>

1632
01:26:40.821 --> 01:26:42.830
<v Speaker 5>different indicators because that's what</v>
<v Speaker 5>you do.</v>

1633
01:26:42.860 --> 01:26:46.280
<v Speaker 5>If you're careful and if it happens to </v>
<v Speaker 5>be hovering up near the top,</v>

1634
01:26:46.490 --> 01:26:48.260
<v Speaker 5>then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1635
01:26:48.550 --> 01:26:52.310
<v Speaker 5>it might be just the grace of God might </v>
<v Speaker 5>be just good fortune,</v>

1636
01:26:52.490 --> 01:26:53.323
<v Speaker 5>but it is possible that we've got </v>
<v Speaker 5>something right and that we shouldn't </v>

1637
01:26:56.211 --> 01:26:57.044
<v Speaker 5>muck around with it too much and that we</v>
<v Speaker 5>should have some gratitude for it </v>

1638
01:27:00.410 --> 01:27:01.243
<v Speaker 5>instead of assuming that the proper </v>
<v Speaker 5>comparison is whatever heaven that you </v>

1639
01:27:04.281 --> 01:27:05.114
<v Speaker 5>happen to be able to dream up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you would love to impose on other </v>

1640
01:27:07.851 --> 01:27:11.060
<v Speaker 5>people without their cooperation and </v>
<v Speaker 5>without their will,</v>

1641
01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:12.313
<v Speaker 5>and that's what the bloody social </v>
<v Speaker 5>utopians are selling us and they're </v>

1642
01:27:14.361 --> 01:27:15.194
<v Speaker 5>doing everything they can to implement </v>
<v Speaker 5>and institute that as rapidly as </v>

1643
01:27:17.541 --> 01:27:18.140
<v Speaker 5>possible.</v>

1644
01:27:18.140 --> 01:27:21.260
<v Speaker 5>It's like enough of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We've had enough of that like I,</v>

1645
01:27:21.410 --> 01:27:22.243
<v Speaker 5>the reason I got into this to begin with</v>
<v Speaker 5>is because I started studying </v>

1646
01:27:24.861 --> 01:27:25.694
<v Speaker 5>totalitarianism when I was about 13 but </v>
<v Speaker 5>I really started to study it when I was </v>

1647
01:27:28.791 --> 01:27:29.624
<v Speaker 5>about 22 and I spent like 15 20,000 </v>
<v Speaker 5>hours reading and writing about </v>

1648
01:27:33.801 --> 01:27:36.920
<v Speaker 5>totalitarianism three hours a day for 15</v>
<v Speaker 5>years.</v>

1649
01:27:36.921 --> 01:27:39.860
<v Speaker 5>That was the first book I wrote.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just about bloody well killed me.</v>

1650
01:27:39.980 --> 01:27:41.750
<v Speaker 5>It's horrible stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

1651
01:27:41.751 --> 01:27:44.360
<v Speaker 5>I was curious about what the hell had </v>
<v Speaker 5>happened,</v>

1652
01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:45.313
<v Speaker 5>not only not only in Nazi Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then installing this brush in Mao's </v>

1653
01:27:48.441 --> 01:27:51.320
<v Speaker 5>China and in the Cold War's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the hell were we up to?</v>

1654
01:27:51.470 --> 01:27:53.720
<v Speaker 5>Why were we doing all of that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was trying to figure it out.</v>

1655
01:27:53.930 --> 01:27:57.230
<v Speaker 5>It's not a pretty sight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1656
01:27:57.290 --> 01:28:00.710
<v Speaker 5>a lot of that's driven by this insane </v>
<v Speaker 5>Utopian vision.</v>

1657
01:28:01.100 --> 01:28:02.750
<v Speaker 5>It's not a place we want to go.</v>

1658
01:28:02.990 --> 01:28:03.823
<v Speaker 5>We want to accept the flaws in our </v>
<v Speaker 5>system with some humility and some </v>

1659
01:28:06.051 --> 01:28:08.600
<v Speaker 5>desire to improve things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But good God.</v>

1660
01:28:08.601 --> 01:28:09.434
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the 20th century was a dreadful </v>

1661
01:28:11.481 --> 01:28:12.314
<v Speaker 5>bloodbath.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was a horrific hundred years and we </v>

1662
01:28:14.331 --> 01:28:15.164
<v Speaker 5>should have learned,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we should have learned arrogant utopia </v>

1663
01:28:19.460 --> 01:28:22.460
<v Speaker 5>turns into hell.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what we should have learned.</v>

1664
01:28:22.700 --> 01:28:25.220
<v Speaker 5>And yet we have people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>plenty arrogant,</v>

1665
01:28:25.430 --> 01:28:27.740
<v Speaker 5>purveying utopia left and right and </v>
<v Speaker 5>saying,</v>

1666
01:28:27.741 --> 01:28:29.960
<v Speaker 5>hey look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the utopia hasn't come yet.</v>

1667
01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:32.420
<v Speaker 5>And the reason for that is you're a </v>
<v Speaker 5>misogynistic bigot.</v>

1668
01:28:32.780 --> 01:28:33.613
<v Speaker 5>And if you don't believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I can't measure it by asking you or </v>

1669
01:28:36.381 --> 01:28:39.080
<v Speaker 5>even know to any observable behavior on </v>
<v Speaker 5>your part,</v>

1670
01:28:39.230 --> 01:28:40.063
<v Speaker 5>then I'm going to infer it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or I'll give you an unconscious bias </v>

1671
01:28:42.231 --> 01:28:44.510
<v Speaker 5>test that doesn't even measure what it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>supposed to measure.</v>

1672
01:28:44.690 --> 01:28:48.020
<v Speaker 5>So you're a damn misogynist and a bigot </v>
<v Speaker 5>whether you know it or not,</v>

1673
01:28:48.110 --> 01:28:48.943
<v Speaker 5>whether you want to be or not and </v>
<v Speaker 5>whether or not the evidence suggests </v>

1674
01:28:51.081 --> 01:28:53.510
<v Speaker 5>that you are or not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So no,</v>

1675
01:28:53.630 --> 01:28:57.740
<v Speaker 5>we're not going to sell out our society </v>
<v Speaker 5>to utopians of that sort.</v>

1676
01:28:58.130 --> 01:29:01.340
<v Speaker 5>And so I would say to people who want to</v>
<v Speaker 5>be conservative.</v>

1677
01:29:01.710 --> 01:29:02.010
<v Speaker 5>First</v>

1678
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:02.843
<v Speaker 4>of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have every right to be conservative </v>

1679
01:29:04.200 --> 01:29:06.150
<v Speaker 4>and there's nothing wrong with you for </v>
<v Speaker 4>being conservative.</v>

1680
01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:07.193
<v Speaker 4>And second,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like it's time to get the hell </v>

1681
01:29:08.791 --> 01:29:13.791
<v Speaker 4>organized and push back and get that 5% </v>
<v Speaker 4>of hyper educated,</v>

1682
01:29:14.130 --> 01:29:14.963
<v Speaker 4>resentful utopian dreamers who would </v>
<v Speaker 4>like to bring the whole God damn </v>

1683
01:29:18.241 --> 01:29:22.410
<v Speaker 4>civilization to its knees out of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>systems of power.</v>

1684
01:29:22.860 --> 01:29:25.350
<v Speaker 4>It's not the same country it was 10 </v>
<v Speaker 4>years ago.</v>

1685
01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:28.260
<v Speaker 4>It's we need to wake up and we need to </v>
<v Speaker 4>stop this from happening.</v>

1686
01:29:28.470 --> 01:29:31.800
<v Speaker 4>I would say these are more practical </v>
<v Speaker 4>circumstances.</v>

1687
01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:32.753
<v Speaker 4>The Ontario Human Rights Commission,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that thing has to go the social justice </v>

1688
01:29:35.581 --> 01:29:36.960
<v Speaker 4>tribunals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I made it</v>

1689
01:29:37.350 --> 01:29:42.350
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

1690
01:29:43.550 --> 01:29:45.770
<v Speaker 4>that thing has to go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that thing has to go,</v>

1691
01:29:45.800 --> 01:29:46.633
<v Speaker 4>we need to pay a lot more attention to </v>
<v Speaker 4>what the faculties of education or </v>

1692
01:29:49.401 --> 01:29:50.234
<v Speaker 4>teaching teachers because they are </v>
<v Speaker 4>transforming the elementary school and </v>

1693
01:29:53.961 --> 01:29:54.794
<v Speaker 4>the junior high school and high school </v>
<v Speaker 4>systems into nothing but propaganda </v>

1694
01:29:57.741 --> 01:30:00.230
<v Speaker 4>machines for radical postmodernists </v>
<v Speaker 4>doctrine.</v>

1695
01:30:00.410 --> 01:30:01.243
<v Speaker 4>And if you don't believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just go look it up on the web and </v>

1696
01:30:03.231 --> 01:30:06.470
<v Speaker 4>see what they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what they're attempting to impose.</v>

1697
01:30:06.710 --> 01:30:08.870
<v Speaker 4>And so that's got to stop,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right or easy.</v>

1698
01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:11.090
<v Speaker 4>The Ontario Institute for Studies of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Education,</v>

1699
01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:12.073
<v Speaker 4>that is not a good place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They need to be held accountable for </v>

1700
01:30:14.721 --> 01:30:15.554
<v Speaker 4>what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're supposed to be studying how to </v>

1701
01:30:17.541 --> 01:30:21.380
<v Speaker 4>educate children more effectively and </v>
<v Speaker 4>faster and cheaper and better.</v>

1702
01:30:21.470 --> 01:30:23.780
<v Speaker 4>And that isn't what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're producing.</v>

1703
01:30:23.990 --> 01:30:24.823
<v Speaker 4>People have the most radical and </v>
<v Speaker 4>resentful sort to get a handle on the </v>

1704
01:30:29.751 --> 01:30:32.570
<v Speaker 4>minds of children as young as they </v>
<v Speaker 4>possibly can.</v>

1705
01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:34.340
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the doctrine.</v>

1706
01:30:34.370 --> 01:30:35.203
<v Speaker 4>I'm not making this up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's actually quite intelligent if </v>

1707
01:30:37.191 --> 01:30:39.980
<v Speaker 4>that's what it is that you're aiming for</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's got to,</v>

1708
01:30:40.100 --> 01:30:42.170
<v Speaker 4>that's got to come to a stop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we've,</v>

1709
01:30:42.440 --> 01:30:44.630
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if there's more that needs </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be done done to,</v>

1710
01:30:44.631 --> 01:30:48.680
<v Speaker 4>they'll whole bloody human rights </v>
<v Speaker 4>establishment has to be retooled because</v>

1711
01:30:48.681 --> 01:30:50.930
<v Speaker 4>it's working at counter purposes to </v>
<v Speaker 4>itself.</v>

1712
01:30:50.931 --> 01:30:53.120
<v Speaker 4>It was probably a mistake back in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>when it,</v>

1713
01:30:53.121 --> 01:30:53.954
<v Speaker 4>when was it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was probably a mistake to introduce </v>

1714
01:30:55.401 --> 01:30:57.350
<v Speaker 4>the damn bill writes into Canada to </v>
<v Speaker 4>begin with.</v>

1715
01:30:57.351 --> 01:31:00.260
<v Speaker 4>It was probably a legislative era that </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're paying desperately for now.</v>

1716
01:31:00.500 --> 01:31:03.230
<v Speaker 4>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those are more specific things and those</v>

1717
01:31:03.231 --> 01:31:04.064
<v Speaker 4>are more opinions of mine so you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>take them or leave them as far as I'm </v>

1718
01:31:07.191 --> 01:31:09.560
<v Speaker 4>concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But these 12 points that I made,</v>

1719
01:31:09.561 --> 01:31:10.790
<v Speaker 4>as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1720
01:31:10.940 --> 01:31:14.840
<v Speaker 4>those are reasons to be conservative and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not reasons to be ashamed of it.</v>

1721
01:31:14.840 --> 01:31:17.540
<v Speaker 4>And if you're afraid of speaking your </v>
<v Speaker 4>mind as a conservative,</v>

1722
01:31:17.541 --> 01:31:20.480
<v Speaker 4>well stumble a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>make a few mistakes,</v>

1723
01:31:20.481 --> 01:31:22.100
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to make some mistakes.</v>

1724
01:31:22.101 --> 01:31:23.000
<v Speaker 4>You're probably,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1725
01:31:23.001 --> 01:31:25.040
<v Speaker 4>not as articulate as you might be in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Believe me,</v>

1726
01:31:25.041 --> 01:31:25.874
<v Speaker 4>there's lots of things you need to know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you start saying what you think </v>

1727
01:31:28.401 --> 01:31:29.234
<v Speaker 4>carefully,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people will correct you and you'll get </v>

1728
01:31:30.621 --> 01:31:31.454
<v Speaker 4>better at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you better start doing it because </v>

1729
01:31:33.830 --> 01:31:36.830
<v Speaker 4>the situation that we're in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's worse than it looks.</v>

1730
01:31:36.890 --> 01:31:40.580
<v Speaker 4>That's how it looks to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So anyways,</v>

1731
01:31:41.150 --> 01:31:44.390
<v Speaker 4>that's all I've got to say about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So thank you for the invitation.</v>

1732
01:31:44.620 --> 01:31:49.620
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] you gonna open</v>

1733
01:31:54.430 --> 01:31:58.450
<v Speaker 4>up for questions and hopefully some </v>
<v Speaker 4>answers as well.</v>

1734
01:31:59.110 --> 01:32:00.160
<v Speaker 4>So if anybody has</v>

1735
01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:00.993
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we only have one microphone so you'll </v>

1736
01:32:03.200 --> 01:32:08.200
<v Speaker 1>have to stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like you to speak loudly and clearly</v>

1737
01:32:08.741 --> 01:32:09.574
<v Speaker 1>so we can all hear and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also state your name and where </v>

1738
01:32:12.851 --> 01:32:13.684
<v Speaker 1>you're from,</v>

1739
01:32:19.470 --> 01:32:24.470
<v Speaker 6>separation</v>
<v Speaker 6>of church and state</v>

1740
01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:32.840
<v Speaker 6>churches</v>
<v Speaker 6>of Western society,</v>

1741
01:32:35.730 --> 01:32:36.590
<v Speaker 6>religion and Christianity.</v>

1742
01:32:41.570 --> 01:32:42.700
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1743
01:32:42.820 --> 01:32:44.290
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ask An easy question.</v>

1744
01:32:44.710 --> 01:32:45.543
<v Speaker 3>So the question essentially was what my </v>
<v Speaker 3>opinion was about the separation of </v>

1745
01:32:50.381 --> 01:32:53.800
<v Speaker 3>church and state that the nature of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>separation of church and state,</v>

1746
01:32:53.801 --> 01:32:58.801
<v Speaker 3>given the hypothesis that our society is</v>
<v Speaker 3>grounded in a broader structure,</v>

1747
01:33:00.250 --> 01:33:01.900
<v Speaker 3>moral structure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say that has,</v>

1748
01:33:01.910 --> 01:33:03.180
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like God,</v>

1749
01:33:03.340 --> 01:33:05.740
<v Speaker 3>theologically predicated philosophical </v>
<v Speaker 3>basis.</v>

1750
01:33:05.741 --> 01:33:09.310
<v Speaker 3>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first thing I would say is if you,</v>

1751
01:33:09.490 --> 01:33:10.323
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that is a very hard question to </v>

1752
01:33:12.041 --> 01:33:12.874
<v Speaker 3>answer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm doing this series in Toronto </v>

1753
01:33:15.251 --> 01:33:16.084
<v Speaker 3>right now on on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's called the psychological </v>

1754
01:33:17.561 --> 01:33:21.340
<v Speaker 3>significance of the biblical stories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's an answer to that question,</v>

1755
01:33:21.790 --> 01:33:23.620
<v Speaker 3>but it's long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like 40 hours,</v>

1756
01:33:23.621 --> 01:33:24.454
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's like the maps of meaning </v>

1757
01:33:25.391 --> 01:33:28.660
<v Speaker 3>program that that Mr Hillier was </v>
<v Speaker 3>referring to before.</v>

1758
01:33:28.750 --> 01:33:29.583
<v Speaker 3>It's extraordinarily complicated and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>mean I think the right approach to that </v>

1759
01:33:33.851 --> 01:33:35.320
<v Speaker 3>is to say something like that.</v>

1760
01:33:35.560 --> 01:33:36.393
<v Speaker 3>Something like there are things that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>Caesar's and there are things that are </v>

1761
01:33:39.341 --> 01:33:41.530
<v Speaker 3>God's and you should keep those things </v>
<v Speaker 3>apart.</v>

1762
01:33:41.560 --> 01:33:44.770
<v Speaker 3>That's worked in the West.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now the problem without our answer is it</v>

1763
01:33:44.771 --> 01:33:48.220
<v Speaker 3>doesn't precisely describe the proper </v>
<v Speaker 3>interrelationship between the two,</v>

1764
01:33:48.430 --> 01:33:50.500
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think that's actually a </v>
<v Speaker 3>political issue.</v>

1765
01:33:50.830 --> 01:33:53.980
<v Speaker 3>I think that the way that that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>properly bridged is through the ethic of</v>

1766
01:33:53.981 --> 01:33:54.814
<v Speaker 3>the individual is like your religious </v>
<v Speaker 3>belief should be of the sword that </v>

1767
01:33:58.631 --> 01:34:00.580
<v Speaker 3>guides you to be an honest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>decent,</v>

1768
01:34:00.581 --> 01:34:01.414
<v Speaker 3>productive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>respectable person who's aiming at the </v>

1769
01:34:04.271 --> 01:34:06.790
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then if you do that,</v>

1770
01:34:06.791 --> 01:34:08.950
<v Speaker 3>then the political issues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll take care of themselves.</v>

1771
01:34:08.980 --> 01:34:09.813
<v Speaker 3>Not magically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but because we'll organize ourselves </v>

1772
01:34:12.281 --> 01:34:15.520
<v Speaker 3>politically as that sort of people and </v>
<v Speaker 3>do the right things.</v>

1773
01:34:15.820 --> 01:34:16.653
<v Speaker 3>And so I think the connection between </v>
<v Speaker 3>the church and the state is through the </v>

1774
01:34:19.421 --> 01:34:21.010
<v Speaker 3>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how it should work.</v>

1775
01:34:21.011 --> 01:34:23.500
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's why it's kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>worked in the West,</v>

1776
01:34:23.501 --> 01:34:24.334
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting that church state separation </v>

1777
01:34:25.451 --> 01:34:26.860
<v Speaker 3>thing right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's really difficult.</v>

1778
01:34:27.070 --> 01:34:27.903
<v Speaker 3>It's not good when they collapsed into </v>
<v Speaker 3>one another because you instantly get </v>

1779
01:34:30.550 --> 01:34:34.780
<v Speaker 3>the rise of totalitarian theocracy and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we all know how much fun they are.</v>

1780
01:34:35.170 --> 01:34:36.130
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

1781
01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:39.233
<v Speaker 1>I'll just listen to understand what </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to do just to make this </v>

1782
01:34:42.781 --> 01:34:44.430
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you do have a question,</v>

1783
01:34:44.431 --> 01:34:48.810
<v Speaker 1>why don't you come up to the front all </v>
<v Speaker 1>hand over the microphone to you and then</v>

1784
01:34:48.811 --> 01:34:49.470
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1785
01:34:49.470 --> 01:34:52.110
<v Speaker 1>everybody can hear the question clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1786
01:34:52.370 --> 01:34:53.850
<v Speaker 1>and then we'll pass the microphone back.</v>

1787
01:34:55.360 --> 01:34:56.193
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1788
01:34:58.460 --> 01:35:03.460
<v Speaker 7>I'm Brian Oil Oil Zalewski still people,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're going to warn you.</v>

1789
01:35:04.351 --> 01:35:06.360
<v Speaker 7>I took a psychology 100 big deal.</v>

1790
01:35:07.190 --> 01:35:08.590
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

1791
01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:15.200
<v Speaker 7>conceded my Eczema,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the crowd.</v>

1792
01:35:21.250 --> 01:35:22.083
<v Speaker 7>And I have a black Somali Mosley </v>
<v Speaker 7>director who's had a call with me and </v>

1793
01:35:27.071 --> 01:35:29.350
<v Speaker 7>our ideals,</v>
<v Speaker 7>beliefs,</v>

1794
01:35:29.620 --> 01:35:30.700
<v Speaker 7>policies,</v>
<v Speaker 7>et cetera.</v>

1795
01:35:30.701 --> 01:35:31.534
<v Speaker 7>And if I'd known,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I would've brought up here is my guest </v>

1796
01:35:33.490 --> 01:35:38.290
<v Speaker 7>and he's a wonderful guy and many,</v>
<v Speaker 7>many solid talks together.</v>

1797
01:35:38.291 --> 01:35:41.140
<v Speaker 7>And that's probably the one thing that's</v>
<v Speaker 7>missing here tonight.</v>

1798
01:35:44.060 --> 01:35:44.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well look,</v>

1799
01:35:45.180 --> 01:35:48.570
<v Speaker 3>there's something else I'd like to </v>
<v Speaker 3>suggest to conservatives now.</v>

1800
01:35:48.870 --> 01:35:49.800
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1801
01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:51.273
<v Speaker 3>I've interacted with a very diverse </v>
<v Speaker 3>range of people partly because I'm a </v>

1802
01:35:53.891 --> 01:35:54.724
<v Speaker 3>clinical psychologist and I've done a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of different things with different </v>

1803
01:35:57.161 --> 01:35:58.420
<v Speaker 3>people in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1804
01:35:58.810 --> 01:35:59.643
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can speak about this particular issue </v>

1805
01:36:03.281 --> 01:36:04.114
<v Speaker 3>with a modicum of authority.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See in Canada what's happened is that </v>

1806
01:36:07.241 --> 01:36:09.850
<v Speaker 3>we've left the minority immigrants to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the liberals.</v>

1807
01:36:10.390 --> 01:36:11.223
<v Speaker 3>How has a bad idea now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason for that is because the </v>

1808
01:36:13.181 --> 01:36:14.014
<v Speaker 3>liberals have a more liberal immigration</v>
<v Speaker 3>policy and a lot of them are like </v>

1809
01:36:15.881 --> 01:36:16.900
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

1810
01:36:17.550 --> 01:36:18.383
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would you say grateful to the </v>

1811
01:36:20.501 --> 01:36:21.334
<v Speaker 3>Liberals often to trudeau personally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the older trudeau personally </v>

1812
01:36:24.700 --> 01:36:27.060
<v Speaker 3>because he opened the door and let them </v>
<v Speaker 3>in and,</v>

1813
01:36:27.100 --> 01:36:27.933
<v Speaker 3>and it's hard to shake that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But here's something that's very cool </v>

1814
01:36:29.800 --> 01:36:32.530
<v Speaker 3>for conservatives to know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think you're conservative,</v>

1815
01:36:32.531 --> 01:36:34.600
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should go talk to immigrants.</v>

1816
01:36:34.910 --> 01:36:38.020
<v Speaker 3>There are so conservative they make you </v>
<v Speaker 3>look like social justice warriors,</v>

1817
01:36:38.260 --> 01:36:40.480
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's a real conversation.</v>

1818
01:36:41.320 --> 01:36:42.153
<v Speaker 3>There's a real conversation to be had </v>
<v Speaker 3>with immigrants and minorities in </v>

1819
01:36:44.951 --> 01:36:46.280
<v Speaker 3>Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I spent it,</v>

1820
01:36:46.380 --> 01:36:47.213
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially the immigrant minorities and </v>

1821
01:36:48.101 --> 01:36:50.020
<v Speaker 3>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1822
01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:53.433
<v Speaker 3>we would have been a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 3>restrictive in the past about our </v>

1823
01:36:55.451 --> 01:37:00.040
<v Speaker 3>immigration policies and I can </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand why that might marcus out his</v>

1824
01:37:00.041 --> 01:37:00.874
<v Speaker 3>enemies to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but one of the things you have to </v>

1825
01:37:02.621 --> 01:37:03.454
<v Speaker 3>understand is that the bedrock values </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I have are much closer to the </v>

1826
01:37:08.441 --> 01:37:12.400
<v Speaker 3>bedrock values than you that you have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then the people that you're voting for.</v>

1827
01:37:12.910 --> 01:37:13.743
<v Speaker 3>And you know the minority immigrants in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Ontario in particular are starting to </v>

1828
01:37:16.991 --> 01:37:17.824
<v Speaker 3>figure this out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially with regards to Kathleen </v>

1829
01:37:18.971 --> 01:37:19.804
<v Speaker 3>winds education policies because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>notice the tilt of those policies and </v>

1830
01:37:23.531 --> 01:37:25.000
<v Speaker 3>they notice that they're not in keeping </v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

1831
01:37:25.001 --> 01:37:25.834
<v Speaker 3>they're often extremely conservative </v>
<v Speaker 3>traditions and so I would say the right </v>

1832
01:37:29.681 --> 01:37:30.514
<v Speaker 3>thing for conservatives to do is like </v>
<v Speaker 3>start telling the minority immigrants </v>

1833
01:37:34.271 --> 01:37:35.980
<v Speaker 3>that you're actually their friends.</v>

1834
01:37:36.190 --> 01:37:37.023
<v Speaker 3>Now that means to establish an </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligent immigration policy and that </v>

1835
01:37:41.491 --> 01:37:44.590
<v Speaker 3>that's a very difficult thing to do and </v>
<v Speaker 3>to begin a real dialogue about that with</v>

1836
01:37:44.591 --> 01:37:47.170
<v Speaker 3>immigrant communities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know who are often,</v>

1837
01:37:47.171 --> 01:37:48.004
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very interested in protecting what they </v>

1838
01:37:50.111 --> 01:37:53.860
<v Speaker 3>found here and not having it disrupted </v>
<v Speaker 3>in any particularly terrible way.</v>

1839
01:37:53.861 --> 01:37:56.310
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's you rackles everywhere,</v>

1840
01:37:56.311 --> 01:37:58.530
<v Speaker 3>but most of the immigrants who come </v>
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>

1841
01:37:58.531 --> 01:38:02.040
<v Speaker 3>if they're pretty damn happy to be here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the conservatives should be out there</v>

1842
01:38:02.041 --> 01:38:05.430
<v Speaker 3>extending a real hand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially I would say especially to the</v>

1843
01:38:05.431 --> 01:38:08.250
<v Speaker 3>moderate Muslims.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a big mistake not to do that.</v>

1844
01:38:08.251 --> 01:38:09.084
<v Speaker 3>There's lots of moderate Muslims.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are people who they're not in </v>

1845
01:38:11.101 --> 01:38:15.390
<v Speaker 3>chanted by the theocratic totalitarians </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're looking for a way to develop</v>

1846
01:38:15.391 --> 01:38:18.330
<v Speaker 3>a bridge between Islam and the West.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's no easy thing.</v>

1847
01:38:18.450 --> 01:38:19.283
<v Speaker 3>I'm not even sure it can be done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there are people of goodwill in our </v>

1848
01:38:21.871 --> 01:38:22.704
<v Speaker 3>country who would like to have that </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened in the conservatives could be </v>

1849
01:38:25.321 --> 01:38:30.000
<v Speaker 3>talking to them and extending a hand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to help on the,</v>

1850
01:38:30.240 --> 01:38:31.350
<v Speaker 3>on the what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>On the,</v>

1851
01:38:32.280 --> 01:38:34.590
<v Speaker 3>on the voting front as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no loss in it,</v>

1852
01:38:34.591 --> 01:38:36.990
<v Speaker 3>there's absolutely no loss.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And all you have to do is knock and say,</v>

1853
01:38:36.991 --> 01:38:39.360
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those people that you're supporting,</v>

1854
01:38:39.361 --> 01:38:43.080
<v Speaker 3>they don't share any of your values.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you noticed that they'll wake up,</v>

1855
01:38:43.140 --> 01:38:44.580
<v Speaker 3>they'll see it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they'll say,</v>

1856
01:38:44.581 --> 01:38:45.061
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1857
01:38:45.061 --> 01:38:49.650
<v Speaker 3>maybe we have more in common with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>traditional conservatives in Canada than</v>

1858
01:38:49.651 --> 01:38:50.484
<v Speaker 3>we thought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wouldn't be a difficult message to </v>

1859
01:38:51.931 --> 01:38:53.310
<v Speaker 3>get to get out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1860
01:38:53.640 --> 01:38:54.473
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1861
01:38:56.280 --> 01:38:57.113
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to follow up on that </v>

1862
01:38:58.331 --> 01:38:59.164
<v Speaker 1>comment from Brian for d for a moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's important to recognize </v>

1863
01:39:04.270 --> 01:39:05.103
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the historical change in shift that has </v>

1864
01:39:08.051 --> 01:39:12.700
<v Speaker 1>happened with immigration in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>country over a long,</v>

1865
01:39:12.701 --> 01:39:14.530
<v Speaker 1>long period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1866
01:39:14.710 --> 01:39:19.710
<v Speaker 1>this country was built and developed on </v>
<v Speaker 1>immigrants to rural areas.</v>

1867
01:39:20.950 --> 01:39:22.270
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's our history.</v>

1868
01:39:22.570 --> 01:39:25.180
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where all our settlement programs</v>

1869
01:39:25.450 --> 01:39:30.310
<v Speaker 1>were to bring new immigrants to whirl </v>
<v Speaker 1>areas.</v>

1870
01:39:30.610 --> 01:39:34.360
<v Speaker 1>That's fundamentally shifted in the last</v>
<v Speaker 1>number of decades.</v>

1871
01:39:34.750 --> 01:39:39.750
<v Speaker 1>New Immigration to this country is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>our significant urban centers.</v>

1872
01:39:43.120 --> 01:39:45.760
<v Speaker 1>That's where it's where it's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I just,</v>

1873
01:39:45.790 --> 01:39:46.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1874
01:39:47.250 --> 01:39:52.250
<v Speaker 1>so walking through Carlton Place is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be a very different</v>

1875
01:39:55.960 --> 01:39:59.710
<v Speaker 1>image than walking through Toronto or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ottawa.</v>

1876
01:40:00.170 --> 01:40:01.390
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's,</v>

1877
01:40:01.391 --> 01:40:02.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1878
01:40:02.291 --> 01:40:05.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm very pleased to see the number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that we have out here,</v>

1879
01:40:06.010 --> 01:40:09.460
<v Speaker 1>the diversity of age and the diversity </v>
<v Speaker 1>of people.</v>

1880
01:40:09.730 --> 01:40:10.563
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we just don't have a lot of </v>

1881
01:40:14.020 --> 01:40:16.810
<v Speaker 1>immigrants in rural Ontario.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1882
01:40:17.290 --> 01:40:18.280
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>

1883
01:40:32.890 --> 01:40:37.760
<v Speaker 8>policies like the actual concrete issues</v>
<v Speaker 8>that people may or may not differ on how</v>

1884
01:40:37.780 --> 01:40:38.613
<v Speaker 8>I want it to know what you thought.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like the root causes strictly from a </v>

1885
01:40:41.470 --> 01:40:42.303
<v Speaker 8>psychological perspective that would </v>
<v Speaker 8>derive a lot of these predominantly </v>

1886
01:40:45.641 --> 01:40:47.230
<v Speaker 8>young,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like early to mid twenties,</v>

1887
01:40:47.231 --> 01:40:48.064
<v Speaker 8>what you bars are left people to really </v>
<v Speaker 8>be so reasonable and antiestablishment </v>

1888
01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:58.090
<v Speaker 8>militarize and their thinking and </v>
<v Speaker 8>essentially to have such a negative view</v>

1889
01:40:58.091 --> 01:40:58.924
<v Speaker 8>on the world and to see all these </v>
<v Speaker 8>problems that other people would never </v>

1890
01:41:02.501 --> 01:41:04.330
<v Speaker 8>notice when they have not point almost </v>
<v Speaker 8>terminal.</v>

1891
01:41:04.740 --> 01:41:05.573
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>just strictly and in men and women's </v>

1892
01:41:06.541 --> 01:41:08.320
<v Speaker 8>specifically.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>

1893
01:41:08.380 --> 01:41:10.240
<v Speaker 8>strictly from like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

1894
01:41:10.300 --> 01:41:11.133
<v Speaker 8>what,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what would derive someone you think to </v>

1895
01:41:12.730 --> 01:41:13.563
<v Speaker 8>think that way?</v>

1896
01:41:14.600 --> 01:41:15.031
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

1897
01:41:15.031 --> 01:41:15.864
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we kind of know some of the answers to </v>

1898
01:41:17.151 --> 01:41:17.984
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to make too grandiose a </v>

1899
01:41:20.631 --> 01:41:21.464
<v Speaker 3>claim,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've done some research with my </v>

1900
01:41:22.671 --> 01:41:24.980
<v Speaker 3>graduate students on political </v>
<v Speaker 3>correctness per say,</v>

1901
01:41:24.981 --> 01:41:25.814
<v Speaker 3>because we'd been interesting interested</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the personality predictors of </v>

1902
01:41:28.371 --> 01:41:29.204
<v Speaker 3>political belief.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It really does turn out that you vote </v>

1903
01:41:31.611 --> 01:41:33.410
<v Speaker 3>your personality far more than you </v>
<v Speaker 3>think.</v>

1904
01:41:33.411 --> 01:41:34.244
<v Speaker 3>Because like what you think is that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>look at the world and there's a </v>

1905
01:41:36.261 --> 01:41:37.094
<v Speaker 3>landscape of facts and you view the fact</v>
<v Speaker 3>subjectively and you derive your </v>

1906
01:41:39.411 --> 01:41:40.244
<v Speaker 3>conclusions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the thing is doesn't really work </v>

1907
01:41:41.961 --> 01:41:44.030
<v Speaker 3>that way because there's just too damn </v>
<v Speaker 3>many facts,</v>

1908
01:41:44.060 --> 01:41:44.893
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you can't even really get an </v>

1909
01:41:46.851 --> 01:41:49.100
<v Speaker 3>unbiased sample of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happens is that your,</v>

1910
01:41:49.150 --> 01:41:49.983
<v Speaker 3>your personality works as a filtering </v>
<v Speaker 3>mechanism so that certain things stand </v>

1911
01:41:52.911 --> 01:41:53.744
<v Speaker 3>out for you more than other things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so some things stand out more for </v>

1912
01:41:56.301 --> 01:41:57.590
<v Speaker 3>the people on the radical left.</v>

1913
01:41:57.590 --> 01:42:00.650
<v Speaker 3>And some things stand out for people who</v>
<v Speaker 3>are liberal in some things stand out for</v>

1914
01:42:00.651 --> 01:42:02.900
<v Speaker 3>people who are conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then everyone says,</v>

1915
01:42:02.901 --> 01:42:05.240
<v Speaker 3>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking at the facts and I'm drawing</v>

1916
01:42:05.241 --> 01:42:06.230
<v Speaker 3>this conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1917
01:42:06.231 --> 01:42:07.064
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what you don't understand is you're </v>

1918
01:42:08.241 --> 01:42:10.640
<v Speaker 3>not looking at the same set of facts and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't even,</v>

1919
01:42:10.641 --> 01:42:11.474
<v Speaker 3>and that's why you have to actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>engage in dialogue with other people </v>

1920
01:42:13.251 --> 01:42:15.920
<v Speaker 3>because they'll expose you to their set </v>
<v Speaker 3>of facts.</v>

1921
01:42:16.220 --> 01:42:17.053
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not saying that facts don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>exist or that they're relativistic or </v>

1922
01:42:19.341 --> 01:42:22.310
<v Speaker 3>anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things we found out about the</v>

1923
01:42:22.311 --> 01:42:23.144
<v Speaker 3>politically correct types is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're high and a trait called </v>

1924
01:42:25.101 --> 01:42:25.934
<v Speaker 3>agreeableness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you might think really that isn't </v>

1925
01:42:27.771 --> 01:42:29.300
<v Speaker 3>what I would've guessed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1926
01:42:29.660 --> 01:42:30.493
<v Speaker 3>but agreeableness is a maternal trait </v>
<v Speaker 3>and women are higher in agreeableness </v>

1927
01:42:34.371 --> 01:42:36.110
<v Speaker 3>than Matt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's cross cultural.</v>

1928
01:42:36.111 --> 01:42:36.944
<v Speaker 3>And that difference really seems to </v>
<v Speaker 3>start manifesting itself primarily a </v>

1929
01:42:40.051 --> 01:42:40.490
<v Speaker 3>puberty.</v>

1930
01:42:40.490 --> 01:42:41.323
<v Speaker 3>And so agreeableness is likely the trait</v>
<v Speaker 3>that stops you from throwing your baby </v>

1931
01:42:44.131 --> 01:42:46.570
<v Speaker 3>it out the window at three in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>morning when it's speed,</v>

1932
01:42:46.571 --> 01:42:49.460
<v Speaker 3>when just had colac for three hours and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you haven't had any sleep and you're not</v>

1933
01:42:49.461 --> 01:42:51.290
<v Speaker 3>in very good shape and you just got laid</v>
<v Speaker 3>off.</v>

1934
01:42:51.590 --> 01:42:54.320
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very tight bonding mechanism.</v>

1935
01:42:54.620 --> 01:42:55.453
<v Speaker 3>And so what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's primarily driven by what you might </v>

1936
01:42:57.441 --> 01:42:59.480
<v Speaker 3>describe as compassion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1937
01:42:59.660 --> 01:43:03.710
<v Speaker 3>compassion is great for dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 3>infants and maybe it's great for dealing</v>

1938
01:43:03.711 --> 01:43:06.320
<v Speaker 3>with hurt people and really elderly </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

1939
01:43:06.380 --> 01:43:07.213
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's good for taking care of people who </v>

1940
01:43:08.541 --> 01:43:09.374
<v Speaker 3>can't take care of themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not a great doctrine to be </v>

1941
01:43:12.441 --> 01:43:13.274
<v Speaker 3>building a political system on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so one of the things that happens </v>

1942
01:43:15.831 --> 01:43:18.450
<v Speaker 3>with the more politically correct types </v>
<v Speaker 3>by temperament is that they're,</v>

1943
01:43:18.570 --> 01:43:19.403
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they suffer from an excess of impulsive </v>

1944
01:43:21.501 --> 01:43:22.334
<v Speaker 3>compassion.</v>

1945
01:43:22.550 --> 01:43:25.550
<v Speaker 3>And they assume that if there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>inequitable distribution of anything,</v>

1946
01:43:25.730 --> 01:43:26.563
<v Speaker 3>that the people who are at the bottom </v>
<v Speaker 3>are all victims who should be treated </v>

1947
01:43:29.601 --> 01:43:30.434
<v Speaker 3>like infants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that everyone at the top is a </v>

1948
01:43:31.821 --> 01:43:33.410
<v Speaker 3>vicious snake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Predator.</v>

1949
01:43:33.710 --> 01:43:34.390
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1950
01:43:34.390 --> 01:43:39.390
<v Speaker 3>and that's hard wired in some sense now </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a very popular story.</v>

1951
01:43:41.180 --> 01:43:42.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>

1952
01:43:43.280 --> 01:43:43.931
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an,</v>

1953
01:43:43.931 --> 01:43:46.580
<v Speaker 3>and it's an easy story to sell and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some truth in it,</v>

1954
01:43:46.910 --> 01:43:49.100
<v Speaker 3>but some truth isn't the same as all of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the truth.</v>

1955
01:43:49.460 --> 01:43:53.360
<v Speaker 3>And so what you see at least in is </v>
<v Speaker 3>undifferentiated empathy.</v>

1956
01:43:53.540 --> 01:43:55.400
<v Speaker 3>And that is not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not a virtue.</v>

1957
01:43:55.401 --> 01:43:57.260
<v Speaker 3>It's not a virtue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to think.</v>

1958
01:43:57.261 --> 01:43:58.940
<v Speaker 3>You can't just feel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to think,</v>

1959
01:43:59.300 --> 01:44:01.040
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even when you're taking care of kids,</v>

1960
01:44:01.700 --> 01:44:04.730
<v Speaker 3>part of what you're doing is being </v>
<v Speaker 3>compassionate.</v>

1961
01:44:05.090 --> 01:44:07.610
<v Speaker 3>But if you're too compassionate towards </v>
<v Speaker 3>your kids,</v>

1962
01:44:07.670 --> 01:44:08.870
<v Speaker 3>then you do everything for them.</v>

1963
01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:10.850
<v Speaker 3>And if you do everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything for them,</v>

1964
01:44:10.940 --> 01:44:11.773
<v Speaker 3>then they grow up useless and they never</v>
<v Speaker 3>leave and they hate you and they hate </v>

1965
01:44:15.201 --> 01:44:17.360
<v Speaker 3>everything else too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a bad idea.</v>

1966
01:44:17.540 --> 01:44:18.373
<v Speaker 3>And so you use compassion judiciously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know there's a rule if you're </v>

1967
01:44:21.051 --> 01:44:24.590
<v Speaker 3>working in a place like a nursing home </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the rule is to harsh rule,</v>

1968
01:44:25.010 --> 01:44:25.843
<v Speaker 3>do not do anything for the people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're taking care of that they can do </v>

1969
01:44:27.891 --> 01:44:28.724
<v Speaker 3>for themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so if they have to struggle to feed </v>

1970
01:44:30.981 --> 01:44:31.814
<v Speaker 3>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't buddy while intervene in feed </v>

1971
01:44:33.331 --> 01:44:34.164
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you let them maintain their damn </v>

1972
01:44:35.571 --> 01:44:38.780
<v Speaker 3>independence and you have to be a hard </v>
<v Speaker 3>hearted bastard to do that.</v>

1973
01:44:39.020 --> 01:44:40.670
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to watch someone's struggle like that.</v>

1974
01:44:40.671 --> 01:44:41.504
<v Speaker 3>But you're furthering their long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>medium to longterm independence and </v>

1975
01:44:44.121 --> 01:44:44.954
<v Speaker 3>development.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you do the same thing with your </v>

1976
01:44:45.681 --> 01:44:46.514
<v Speaker 3>children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Treating your children like they're </v>

1977
01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:50.510
<v Speaker 3>endless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Permanent victims is a very bad idea.</v>

1978
01:44:50.600 --> 01:44:53.660
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's part of what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's part of what's also being taught.</v>

1979
01:44:53.661 --> 01:44:54.494
<v Speaker 3>We also know that the kids who are more </v>
<v Speaker 3>likely to be rabidly politically </v>

1980
01:44:58.041 --> 01:44:58.874
<v Speaker 3>correct,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the reasons that they're more </v>

1981
01:44:59.631 --> 01:45:02.300
<v Speaker 3>likely to be that way is because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were taught to be that way.</v>

1982
01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:06.590
<v Speaker 3>We found that even exposure to a single </v>
<v Speaker 3>lecture,</v>

1983
01:45:07.040 --> 01:45:11.150
<v Speaker 3>a single lecture that was associated </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the political correct,</v>

1984
01:45:11.151 --> 01:45:14.690
<v Speaker 3>dogmatic structure was enough to tilt </v>
<v Speaker 3>people in that direction.</v>

1985
01:45:14.930 --> 01:45:19.160
<v Speaker 3>So there's a temperamental proclivity </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then there's failure of education to</v>

1986
01:45:19.161 --> 01:45:19.994
<v Speaker 3>address that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's the exacerbation and </v>

1987
01:45:21.951 --> 01:45:22.784
<v Speaker 3>exaggeration by the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the people who are trying to produce </v>

1988
01:45:25.580 --> 01:45:28.400
<v Speaker 3>like activists by proxy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1989
01:45:28.401 --> 01:45:29.234
<v Speaker 3>one of the most appalling things I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example at mcmaster when I went to </v>

1990
01:45:31.821 --> 01:45:33.280
<v Speaker 3>mcmaster and got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1991
01:45:33.290 --> 01:45:38.090
<v Speaker 3>yelled down by profanity shouting people</v>
<v Speaker 3>who had the bloody gall to hide behind a</v>

1992
01:45:38.091 --> 01:45:41.000
<v Speaker 3>banner that had a hammer and sickle on </v>
<v Speaker 3>it for God's sake.</v>

1993
01:45:41.300 --> 01:45:42.133
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the Nazis would have been out there </v>

1994
01:45:43.221 --> 01:45:45.110
<v Speaker 3>with their swastika,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there would've been held to pay.</v>

1995
01:45:45.111 --> 01:45:46.880
<v Speaker 3>But because it was the hammer and </v>
<v Speaker 3>sickle,</v>

1996
01:45:46.881 --> 01:45:48.050
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's okay.</v>

1997
01:45:48.470 --> 01:45:50.360
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing wrong with being a </v>
<v Speaker 3>communist.</v>

1998
01:45:50.361 --> 01:45:51.194
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry about the 200 million dead people </v>

1999
01:45:53.361 --> 01:45:54.950
<v Speaker 3>folks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they're out there,</v>

2000
01:45:54.951 --> 01:45:56.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hiding behind this,</v>

2001
01:45:56.360 --> 01:45:58.140
<v Speaker 3>behind this banner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2002
01:45:59.030 --> 01:45:59.863
<v Speaker 3>none of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>none of the people who are teaching </v>

2003
01:46:01.071 --> 01:46:01.701
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're out there.</v>

2004
01:46:01.701 --> 01:46:03.920
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they bailed out of the damn discussion,</v>

2005
01:46:03.921 --> 01:46:04.754
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause there were four people who were </v>

2006
01:46:05.121 --> 01:46:07.250
<v Speaker 3>supposed to talk with me there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They all vanished.</v>

2007
01:46:07.400 --> 01:46:10.580
<v Speaker 3>They leave these student proxies to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>out there and do their dirty work.</v>

2008
01:46:10.730 --> 01:46:11.563
<v Speaker 3>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really contemptible so you can lay </v>

2009
01:46:14.031 --> 01:46:14.864
<v Speaker 3>a fair bit of the blame at the feet of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the people who are supposed to be </v>

2010
01:46:17.721 --> 01:46:20.570
<v Speaker 3>educating them but that are instead </v>
<v Speaker 3>indoctrinating them.</v>

2011
01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:22.520
<v Speaker 3>So that's what it looks like to me.</v>

2012
01:46:31.540 --> 01:46:32.373
<v Speaker 6>Blank.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We often focus on the fact that they </v>

2013
01:46:37.190 --> 01:46:38.023
<v Speaker 6>tried to restrict our use of language,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I also see that there's a focus on </v>

2014
01:46:42.941 --> 01:46:47.941
<v Speaker 6>redefining the terms,</v>
<v Speaker 6>trying to redefine the key of language.</v>

2015
01:46:51.150 --> 01:46:53.130
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>by way of example,</v>

2016
01:46:53.131 --> 01:46:56.130
<v Speaker 6>I would say genocide,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the term which is,</v>

2017
01:46:56.310 --> 01:46:57.180
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fell in love,</v>

2018
01:46:57.181 --> 01:47:00.210
<v Speaker 6>the historical significance.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's very powerful.</v>

2019
01:47:00.211 --> 01:47:05.211
<v Speaker 6>Parts of Alvin brought them</v>
<v Speaker 6>and there were other</v>

2020
01:47:09.440 --> 01:47:14.440
<v Speaker 6>following.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Thank you very much.</v>

2021
01:47:17.190 --> 01:47:21.570
<v Speaker 3>Restrict.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry I wasn't ignoring you.</v>

2022
01:47:21.571 --> 01:47:22.404
<v Speaker 3>I had just made a whole lexicon and </v>
<v Speaker 3>politically correct words today in the </v>

2023
01:47:25.171 --> 01:47:28.080
<v Speaker 3>car and I wanted to read it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but unfortunately I can't find it.</v>

2024
01:47:28.380 --> 01:47:31.080
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one only do they redefined,</v>

2025
01:47:31.081 --> 01:47:32.490
<v Speaker 3>but they also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2026
01:47:32.850 --> 01:47:33.683
<v Speaker 3>produce new words neologisms constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things I want to do is </v>

2027
01:47:36.900 --> 01:47:39.630
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to make a video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to collect all these words.</v>

2028
01:47:39.810 --> 01:47:40.643
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to do it properly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go through a very large </v>

2029
01:47:42.751 --> 01:47:45.530
<v Speaker 3>corpus of postmodern work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to pull out the buzzwords,</v>

2030
01:47:45.900 --> 01:47:48.480
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to rank order them in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 3>their frequency.</v>

2031
01:47:48.780 --> 01:47:52.530
<v Speaker 3>And then I'm going to make a video for </v>
<v Speaker 3>parents and for freshmen and it,</v>

2032
01:47:52.531 --> 01:47:53.364
<v Speaker 3>with the checklist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it says you go through the courses and </v>

2033
01:47:55.801 --> 01:47:58.020
<v Speaker 3>if there's one of these words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you check them off this list.</v>

2034
01:47:58.021 --> 01:47:59.340
<v Speaker 3>And if there's more than,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2035
01:47:59.341 --> 01:48:00.174
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the course scores more than five out </v>

2036
01:48:02.131 --> 01:48:02.964
<v Speaker 3>of whatever on this list,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and don't take that course unless you </v>

2037
01:48:05.551 --> 01:48:06.510
<v Speaker 3>want to join the cult.</v>

2038
01:48:07.050 --> 01:48:09.030
<v Speaker 3>And so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

2039
01:48:09.470 --> 01:48:13.240
<v Speaker 3>because I thought about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2040
01:48:13.241 --> 01:48:16.640
<v Speaker 3>because one of the things I proposed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a kind of a radical solution.</v>

2041
01:48:16.660 --> 01:48:19.100
<v Speaker 3>I probably proposed it when I was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little more angry than I should've been.</v>

2042
01:48:19.120 --> 01:48:19.953
<v Speaker 3>I thought one of the things the </v>
<v Speaker 3>provincial government should do is cut </v>

2043
01:48:22.020 --> 01:48:24.630
<v Speaker 3>the funding to higher education by 25% </v>
<v Speaker 3>and let,</v>

2044
01:48:24.690 --> 01:48:28.010
<v Speaker 3>let the God damn intellectuals fight </v>
<v Speaker 3>among themselves until they straightened</v>

2045
01:48:28.011 --> 01:48:28.844
<v Speaker 3>out the university hierarchies and </v>
<v Speaker 3>decide which disciplines are valid in </v>

2046
01:48:31.501 --> 01:48:33.480
<v Speaker 3>which aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now there's a problem with that.</v>

2047
01:48:33.481 --> 01:48:34.350
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a problem,</v>

2048
01:48:34.380 --> 01:48:36.390
<v Speaker 3>a couple of problems with that is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

2049
01:48:36.391 --> 01:48:38.450
<v Speaker 3>it would wreak havoc with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>universities and that's,</v>

2050
01:48:38.480 --> 01:48:40.290
<v Speaker 3>that's not it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not a good idea.</v>

2051
01:48:40.710 --> 01:48:41.543
<v Speaker 3>The second is you got to watch it when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to control the free </v>

2052
01:48:44.401 --> 01:48:47.040
<v Speaker 3>exchange of academic ideas by top down </v>
<v Speaker 3>Fiat,</v>

2053
01:48:47.041 --> 01:48:47.874
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it's another one of those </v>

2054
01:48:48.840 --> 01:48:49.673
<v Speaker 3>radical social experiments that might go</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong and probably will cause it might </v>

2055
01:48:52.951 --> 01:48:55.860
<v Speaker 3>be you that decides what shouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 3>taught in universities now,</v>

2056
01:48:55.861 --> 01:48:58.350
<v Speaker 3>but God only knows who it's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>in three or four years.</v>

2057
01:48:58.500 --> 01:48:59.333
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2058
01:48:59.370 --> 01:49:00.203
<v Speaker 3>so it's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think one of the things that </v>

2059
01:49:01.831 --> 01:49:02.664
<v Speaker 3>should be done is that people should be </v>
<v Speaker 3>educated so that they can determine </v>

2060
01:49:05.881 --> 01:49:06.714
<v Speaker 3>which of these courses are like that in </v>
<v Speaker 3>which professors and then just stop </v>

2061
01:49:09.241 --> 01:49:11.610
<v Speaker 3>attending the classes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that's happening anyways,</v>

2062
01:49:11.611 --> 01:49:12.444
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause the enrollment in the humanities </v>

2063
01:49:13.411 --> 01:49:14.244
<v Speaker 3>has plummeted since the 1960s and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason and the humanities are at the </v>

2064
01:49:17.131 --> 01:49:19.050
<v Speaker 3>core of the university,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make no mistake about it.</v>

2065
01:49:19.080 --> 01:49:21.030
<v Speaker 3>If the humanities goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the universities are done,</v>

2066
01:49:21.660 --> 01:49:22.493
<v Speaker 3>but so they're already destroying their </v>
<v Speaker 3>own market viability even though they </v>

2067
01:49:26.761 --> 01:49:29.640
<v Speaker 3>keep bringing more and more people into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the universities and colleges.</v>

2068
01:49:29.820 --> 01:49:31.560
<v Speaker 3>But I think that needs to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>accelerated.</v>

2069
01:49:31.830 --> 01:49:34.830
<v Speaker 3>What has to happen is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2070
01:49:34.980 --> 01:49:38.280
<v Speaker 3>the postmodernist radical types need to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be cut off at the source.</v>

2071
01:49:38.460 --> 01:49:41.820
<v Speaker 3>Students need to stop going to their </v>
<v Speaker 3>classes.</v>

2072
01:49:42.030 --> 01:49:45.900
<v Speaker 3>And so that means that high school </v>
<v Speaker 3>students and freshmen and the parents of</v>

2073
01:49:45.901 --> 01:49:49.450
<v Speaker 3>those people need to know what to look </v>
<v Speaker 3>out for.</v>

2074
01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:50.411
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

2075
01:49:50.411 --> 01:49:53.590
<v Speaker 3>I'm very cognizant of their use of </v>
<v Speaker 3>language.</v>

2076
01:49:53.591 --> 01:49:56.680
<v Speaker 3>It's also why I oppose bill [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2077
01:49:57.040 --> 01:49:57.873
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to say words that other </v>
<v Speaker 3>people demand that I say I'm not going </v>

2078
01:50:01.241 --> 01:50:02.074
<v Speaker 3>to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the reason that I'm not going to do </v>

2079
01:50:03.161 --> 01:50:06.400
<v Speaker 3>that is because there isn't anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>more important to me.</v>

2080
01:50:06.730 --> 01:50:07.563
<v Speaker 3>Then the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact that I have then the fact that </v>

2081
01:50:12.341 --> 01:50:13.174
<v Speaker 3>I know I haven't got that right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing more important to me </v>

2082
01:50:17.320 --> 01:50:22.320
<v Speaker 3>than the responsibility I have to honor </v>
<v Speaker 3>the words that I believe to be true.</v>

2083
01:50:23.020 --> 01:50:28.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm not using someone else's words and </v>
<v Speaker 3>bill see 16 by the way,</v>

2084
01:50:28.541 --> 01:50:29.860
<v Speaker 3>which your Senate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2085
01:50:30.100 --> 01:50:30.933
<v Speaker 3>so a delightfully passed today makes </v>
<v Speaker 3>compelled speech part of the Canadian </v>

2086
01:50:35.740 --> 01:50:36.573
<v Speaker 3>legal system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a threshold has been crossed and you </v>

2087
01:50:41.201 --> 01:50:43.870
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's to help the transgendered people.</v>

2088
01:50:43.871 --> 01:50:45.040
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2089
01:50:45.041 --> 01:50:46.990
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not why it happened.</v>

2090
01:50:47.290 --> 01:50:48.123
<v Speaker 3>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't see the language game to your </v>

2091
01:50:52.211 --> 01:50:53.044
<v Speaker 3>political enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You do not allow them to force you to </v>

2092
01:50:55.661 --> 01:50:58.120
<v Speaker 3>use their terminology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As soon as they do that,</v>

2093
01:50:59.020 --> 01:51:00.640
<v Speaker 3>you lose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2094
01:51:00.641 --> 01:51:02.950
<v Speaker 3>and that was what bill [inaudible] 16 </v>
<v Speaker 3>was about for me.</v>

2095
01:51:03.280 --> 01:51:05.080
<v Speaker 3>And there's something cool about that </v>
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

2096
01:51:05.560 --> 01:51:06.730
<v Speaker 3>It was very surprising,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2097
01:51:06.731 --> 01:51:10.180
<v Speaker 3>because</v>
<v Speaker 3>what should have,</v>

2098
01:51:10.181 --> 01:51:11.014
<v Speaker 3>what should have happened was that no </v>
<v Speaker 3>one paid any damn attention to the </v>

2099
01:51:12.551 --> 01:51:14.410
<v Speaker 3>videos I made at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what should have happened.</v>

2100
01:51:14.411 --> 01:51:16.240
<v Speaker 3>Or the next thing that should have </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened is,</v>

2101
01:51:16.260 --> 01:51:17.093
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was 15 minute flurry about it and </v>

2102
01:51:18.211 --> 01:51:19.780
<v Speaker 3>then everybody went back to their </v>
<v Speaker 3>business.</v>

2103
01:51:20.020 --> 01:51:20.853
<v Speaker 3>That didn't happen either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happened was an inordinate amount </v>

2104
01:51:23.411 --> 01:51:26.860
<v Speaker 3>of attention congregated around this </v>
<v Speaker 3>issue and I've been trying to figure out</v>

2105
01:51:26.861 --> 01:51:29.200
<v Speaker 3>why ever since it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

2106
01:51:29.201 --> 01:51:31.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something's,</v>

2107
01:51:32.140 --> 01:51:34.750
<v Speaker 3>something's rotten in the state of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Denmark.</v>

2108
01:51:34.751 --> 01:51:36.370
<v Speaker 3>There's something strange going on here.</v>

2109
01:51:36.820 --> 01:51:37.653
<v Speaker 3>And it certainly wasn't because what I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was talking about was about transgender </v>

2110
01:51:41.171 --> 01:51:45.760
<v Speaker 3>issues because it important or </v>
<v Speaker 3>unimportant as they may be at best,</v>

2111
01:51:45.761 --> 01:51:46.930
<v Speaker 3>they're a side issue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2112
01:51:47.150 --> 01:51:47.800
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

2113
01:51:47.800 --> 01:51:48.633
<v Speaker 3>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it isn't something that affects enough </v>

2114
01:51:49.571 --> 01:51:52.630
<v Speaker 3>people to be of any requisite </v>
<v Speaker 3>seriousness.</v>

2115
01:51:52.631 --> 01:51:54.610
<v Speaker 3>So why all the attention?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2116
01:51:54.611 --> 01:51:56.770
<v Speaker 3>it's because there's something real </v>
<v Speaker 3>going on underneath it.</v>

2117
01:51:57.040 --> 01:51:59.620
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a fight over language.</v>

2118
01:51:59.830 --> 01:52:01.000
<v Speaker 3>That's why Derrida,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2119
01:52:01.001 --> 01:52:01.834
<v Speaker 3>Jacques Derrida,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he criticized Western culture and he's </v>

2120
01:52:04.121 --> 01:52:07.720
<v Speaker 3>the head trickster of the postmodernists</v>
<v Speaker 3>fell logo centric.</v>

2121
01:52:07.750 --> 01:52:08.583
<v Speaker 3>That's our culture and the logos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That speech and these people who are </v>

2122
01:52:11.321 --> 01:52:13.660
<v Speaker 3>passing these bills,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are no friends of free speech.</v>

2123
01:52:13.661 --> 01:52:14.494
<v Speaker 3>There are no friends of free thought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want to put restrictions on it </v>

2124
01:52:16.541 --> 01:52:17.374
<v Speaker 3>cause they already know what's right and</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you disagree it isn't that you </v>

2125
01:52:20.861 --> 01:52:21.694
<v Speaker 3>disagree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's that you're wrong and you should </v>

2126
01:52:23.081 --> 01:52:23.950
<v Speaker 3>shut the hell up.</v>

2127
01:52:23.980 --> 01:52:26.380
<v Speaker 3>And if you don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to figure out how to do it.</v>

2128
01:52:26.860 --> 01:52:27.693
<v Speaker 3>And so that's the sort of people who are</v>
<v Speaker 3>obtaining positions of power in our mid </v>

2129
01:52:31.181 --> 01:52:34.270
<v Speaker 3>level bureaucracies and higher.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's really not a good thing.</v>

2130
01:52:34.510 --> 01:52:36.940
<v Speaker 3>That is not the sort of people that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to be running things.</v>

2131
01:52:37.210 --> 01:52:38.043
<v Speaker 3>And some of that's because we've </v>
<v Speaker 3>abdicated our responsibility to run </v>

2132
01:52:40.121 --> 01:52:43.000
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The competent people have bucketed their</v>

2133
01:52:43.001 --> 01:52:45.500
<v Speaker 3>responsibility to run things themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2134
01:52:45.800 --> 01:52:48.980
<v Speaker 3>they've abandoned politics and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't serve on the school boards.</v>

2135
01:52:49.340 --> 01:52:51.350
<v Speaker 3>They don't run their own churches and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2136
01:52:51.351 --> 01:52:52.184
<v Speaker 3>they leave that to other people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like snot a good idea because it's </v>

2137
01:52:54.261 --> 01:52:56.270
<v Speaker 3>the wrong sort of people who step in to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do that.</v>

2138
01:52:57.670 --> 01:52:58.503
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

2139
01:53:07.980 --> 01:53:11.890
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Carlton Place,</v>

2140
01:53:12.010 --> 01:53:16.150
<v Speaker 6>it's almost considered a suburb,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the bottom and now you can see the steam</v>

2141
01:53:16.151 --> 01:53:19.760
<v Speaker 6>rising from Ottawa and commonplace over </v>
<v Speaker 6>the issue of</v>

2142
01:53:21.970 --> 01:53:22.803
<v Speaker 6>CRTC is comprised of an idea for some </v>
<v Speaker 6>French Canadians and that doesn't sit </v>

2143
01:53:29.051 --> 01:53:32.590
<v Speaker 6>well with the rest of the 76% of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>population,</v>

2144
01:53:33.440 --> 01:53:35.610
<v Speaker 6>all the others.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

2145
01:53:35.650 --> 01:53:36.483
<v Speaker 6>I wondered if you had some feedback on </v>
<v Speaker 6>how this can be improved because </v>

2146
01:53:42.011 --> 01:53:45.490
<v Speaker 6>bilingual is really,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in my opinion,</v>

2147
01:53:45.491 --> 01:53:49.870
<v Speaker 6>is a farce.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was merely a means getting out</v>

2148
01:53:54.020 --> 01:53:54.853
<v Speaker 6>population.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When you get 98% of one particular </v>

2149
01:53:58.670 --> 01:54:03.080
<v Speaker 6>federal government</v>
<v Speaker 6>that is totally French Canadian,</v>

2150
01:54:03.400 --> 01:54:08.400
<v Speaker 6>then this is not an equitable situation.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Most of them there,</v>

2151
01:54:09.430 --> 01:54:13.750
<v Speaker 6>let's discuss with somebody who was </v>
<v Speaker 6>getting the hiring.</v>

2152
01:54:14.030 --> 01:54:17.590
<v Speaker 6>He was French Canadian,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Ottawa.</v>

2153
01:54:17.690 --> 01:54:20.110
<v Speaker 6>They simply say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you must fight for your rights,</v>

2154
01:54:20.111 --> 01:54:20.944
<v Speaker 6>but there's nothing to fight about all </v>
<v Speaker 6>the people doing the hiring or a French </v>

2155
01:54:24.461 --> 01:54:26.000
<v Speaker 6>Canadian.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so,</v>

2156
01:54:30.680 --> 01:54:32.780
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's also a really hard question.</v>

2157
01:54:32.890 --> 01:54:33.723
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

2158
01:54:35.210 --> 01:54:36.043
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

2159
01:54:36.330 --> 01:54:38.970
<v Speaker 3>see a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my way of thinking,</v>

2160
01:54:39.660 --> 01:54:43.740
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the entrance of the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 3>group writes into the Canadian.</v>

2161
01:54:43.741 --> 01:54:44.574
<v Speaker 3>Paula de was a consequence of our </v>
<v Speaker 3>attempt to serve the country together </v>

2162
01:54:48.360 --> 01:54:50.940
<v Speaker 3>when the separatist movement was at its </v>
<v Speaker 3>peak.</v>

2163
01:54:51.840 --> 01:54:55.920
<v Speaker 3>And we did so the country together </v>
<v Speaker 3>twice,</v>

2164
01:54:55.921 --> 01:54:56.754
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it damn near fell apart and that </v>

2165
01:54:58.471 --> 01:55:00.240
<v Speaker 3>probably wouldn't have been a good </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

2166
01:55:01.200 --> 01:55:02.033
<v Speaker 3>So what we paid a price for it and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>price we paid was that we left the </v>

2167
01:55:04.891 --> 01:55:09.090
<v Speaker 3>specter of group rights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>enter our common law policy essentially.</v>

2168
01:55:09.330 --> 01:55:11.030
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of what's happening now is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2169
01:55:11.160 --> 01:55:16.160
<v Speaker 3>is the price that we're paying for that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>having given that diagnosis,</v>

2170
01:55:17.850 --> 01:55:18.683
<v Speaker 3>I don't have any cure to offer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what can be done about </v>

2171
01:55:22.441 --> 01:55:23.274
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My suspicions are it's the kind of </v>

2172
01:55:25.171 --> 01:55:27.480
<v Speaker 3>problem that has to be solved at a micro</v>
<v Speaker 3>level,</v>

2173
01:55:27.720 --> 01:55:28.620
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>

2174
01:55:28.621 --> 01:55:31.020
<v Speaker 3>I don't know enough about the specific </v>
<v Speaker 3>issue to,</v>

2175
01:55:31.650 --> 01:55:32.483
<v Speaker 3>to offer anything other than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand why you would find that </v>

2176
01:55:35.911 --> 01:55:36.744
<v Speaker 3>frustrating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've thought similar things about the </v>

2177
01:55:38.161 --> 01:55:39.900
<v Speaker 3>way the federal government is </v>
<v Speaker 3>constituted.</v>

2178
01:55:41.220 --> 01:55:42.053
<v Speaker 3>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've managed to keep the country and </v>

2179
01:55:43.680 --> 01:55:45.510
<v Speaker 3>there was a sacrifice to be made for </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2180
01:55:45.840 --> 01:55:50.760
<v Speaker 3>So</v>
<v Speaker 3>apart from saying,</v>

2181
01:55:50.850 --> 01:55:52.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get the problem,</v>

2182
01:55:52.230 --> 01:55:56.150
<v Speaker 3>I don't have anything to offer on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Yup.</v>

2183
01:56:00.180 --> 01:56:01.013
<v Speaker 3>So I'm actually only going to take one </v>
<v Speaker 3>more question because I'm tired enough </v>

2184
01:56:03.421 --> 01:56:05.490
<v Speaker 3>so that I'm probably going to say </v>
<v Speaker 3>something stupid.</v>

2185
01:56:05.491 --> 01:56:07.830
<v Speaker 3>And since this is taped,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well you know,</v>

2186
01:56:07.831 --> 01:56:08.664
<v Speaker 3>you go to watch that because you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to say any more stupid things than </v>

2187
01:56:11.451 --> 01:56:12.670
<v Speaker 3>necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

2188
01:56:15.020 --> 01:56:15.853
<v Speaker 4>I a little uncomfortable talking to you </v>
<v Speaker 4>because some of what you said really </v>

2189
01:56:20.090 --> 01:56:23.240
<v Speaker 4>made me a little uncomfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think that's what we have to do.</v>

2190
01:56:23.241 --> 01:56:25.310
<v Speaker 4>We have to be uncomfortable some of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

2191
01:56:25.970 --> 01:56:26.803
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you talked about don't send your </v>

2192
01:56:27.951 --> 01:56:30.380
<v Speaker 4>kids to take humanities,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I kind of went,</v>

2193
01:56:30.410 --> 01:56:32.990
<v Speaker 4>what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy.</v>

2194
01:56:34.010 --> 01:56:37.730
<v Speaker 4>I think what you're saying is the way </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's structured now,</v>

2195
01:56:37.820 --> 01:56:40.010
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's dangers.</v>

2196
01:56:40.490 --> 01:56:41.323
<v Speaker 4>So I guess my question is where do we go</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you get the critical thinking skills </v>

2197
01:56:46.250 --> 01:56:47.083
<v Speaker 4>that we need,</v>

2198
01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:52.140
<v Speaker 3>how do we develop them?</v>

2199
01:56:52.430 --> 01:56:53.490
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you said the,</v>

2200
01:56:53.491 --> 01:56:57.120
<v Speaker 4>you want high school students and </v>
<v Speaker 4>parents to be aware of what the problems</v>

2201
01:56:57.121 --> 01:56:57.954
<v Speaker 4>are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where are they going to get these </v>

2202
01:56:58.651 --> 01:56:59.484
<v Speaker 4>critical thinking skills and develop a </v>
<v Speaker 4>certain resilience to a changing world </v>

2203
01:57:04.291 --> 01:57:06.480
<v Speaker 4>around them?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So where would you direct us to go?</v>

2204
01:57:06.570 --> 01:57:07.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2205
01:57:07.180 --> 01:57:08.740
<v Speaker 3>well the first thing I should say is </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2206
01:57:08.741 --> 01:57:11.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm a great admirer of the humanities </v>
<v Speaker 3>psych and of the university.</v>

2207
01:57:11.551 --> 01:57:13.630
<v Speaker 3>So I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the humanities,</v>

2208
01:57:13.960 --> 01:57:16.360
<v Speaker 3>you learn to be a citizen through the </v>
<v Speaker 3>humanities.</v>

2209
01:57:17.050 --> 01:57:19.270
<v Speaker 3>The humanities are at the core of </v>
<v Speaker 3>western culture.</v>

2210
01:57:19.300 --> 01:57:21.100
<v Speaker 3>If they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're in trouble.</v>

2211
01:57:21.520 --> 01:57:24.940
<v Speaker 3>So the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that what's manifesting itself as the</v>

2212
01:57:24.941 --> 01:57:27.640
<v Speaker 3>humanities in the universities is no </v>
<v Speaker 3>longer the humanities.</v>

2213
01:57:27.641 --> 01:57:30.760
<v Speaker 3>It's something almost virtually the </v>
<v Speaker 3>opposite of that.</v>

2214
01:57:31.090 --> 01:57:31.923
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so when I tell people not to go to </v>

2215
01:57:34.871 --> 01:57:37.840
<v Speaker 3>humanities courses in the universities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's with a very heavy heart.</v>

2216
01:57:37.841 --> 01:57:39.320
<v Speaker 3>Believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2217
01:57:39.790 --> 01:57:41.830
<v Speaker 3>now the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where do you go instead?</v>

2218
01:57:42.340 --> 01:57:44.380
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a good question.</v>

2219
01:57:44.680 --> 01:57:46.750
<v Speaker 3>You can always read.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2220
01:57:46.751 --> 01:57:47.584
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that's really cool </v>
<v Speaker 3>about Amazon is all the great books are </v>

2221
01:57:49.541 --> 01:57:51.250
<v Speaker 3>free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're literally free.</v>

2222
01:57:51.251 --> 01:57:54.160
<v Speaker 3>You can go download them on your kindle </v>
<v Speaker 3>for nothing.</v>

2223
01:57:54.370 --> 01:57:55.203
<v Speaker 3>The copyright has expired and people </v>
<v Speaker 3>have been putting electronic versions </v>

2224
01:57:58.091 --> 01:57:58.924
<v Speaker 3>online.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the great books of the Western world </v>

2225
01:58:00.310 --> 01:58:01.143
<v Speaker 3>and even many of the great books of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>20th century are now available </v>

2226
01:58:03.131 --> 01:58:05.050
<v Speaker 3>completely for free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2227
01:58:05.051 --> 01:58:05.884
<v Speaker 3>so you can read them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's lots of information to be </v>

2228
01:58:08.500 --> 01:58:11.620
<v Speaker 3>garnered now on youtube and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>really going to explode over the next 10</v>

2229
01:58:11.621 --> 01:58:12.580
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I mean,</v>

2230
01:58:12.581 --> 01:58:13.414
<v Speaker 3>one of the things I want to work on </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably over the next 10 years is to </v>

2231
01:58:15.731 --> 01:58:19.000
<v Speaker 3>set up a humanities university online.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what I'm starting to work,</v>

2232
01:58:19.240 --> 01:58:20.073
<v Speaker 3>I already have some programs online,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're called self authoring programs </v>

2233
01:58:23.591 --> 01:58:24.520
<v Speaker 3>and they help people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2234
01:58:24.760 --> 01:58:29.500
<v Speaker 3>And partly we designed them to help </v>
<v Speaker 3>people learn to write as well as to help</v>

2235
01:58:29.501 --> 01:58:30.334
<v Speaker 3>them write about themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the self authoring programs help </v>

2236
01:58:32.051 --> 01:58:34.960
<v Speaker 3>people write an autobiography and </v>
<v Speaker 3>analyze their personality,</v>

2237
01:58:34.961 --> 01:58:37.840
<v Speaker 3>faults and virtues and lay out a future </v>
<v Speaker 3>for themselves.</v>

2238
01:58:38.080 --> 01:58:41.590
<v Speaker 3>And when we've had students do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do the future program,</v>

2239
01:58:41.591 --> 01:58:43.300
<v Speaker 3>it's so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happened was that,</v>

2240
01:58:43.870 --> 01:58:44.703
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there the probability that they would </v>

2241
01:58:47.171 --> 01:58:51.220
<v Speaker 3>stay in school went up by about 30% but </v>
<v Speaker 3>something even cooler happened.</v>

2242
01:58:51.430 --> 01:58:53.950
<v Speaker 3>It worked best for the worst performing </v>
<v Speaker 3>students.</v>

2243
01:58:54.730 --> 01:58:58.600
<v Speaker 3>So we did a lot of it in Holland who at </v>
<v Speaker 3>a business school called Erasmus.</v>

2244
01:58:58.780 --> 01:58:59.471
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

2245
01:58:59.471 --> 01:59:01.030
<v Speaker 3>there's a school of management,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rotterman,</v>

2246
01:59:01.060 --> 01:59:04.780
<v Speaker 3>Rotterdam School of management at </v>
<v Speaker 3>Erasmus University and we ran several,</v>

2247
01:59:04.890 --> 01:59:07.750
<v Speaker 3>think it's about 10,000 people through </v>
<v Speaker 3>the future authoring program now.</v>

2248
01:59:08.110 --> 01:59:11.380
<v Speaker 3>And what happened if you looked at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>academic performance of the students,</v>

2249
01:59:11.500 --> 01:59:12.333
<v Speaker 3>the Dutch women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the native Dutch women were at the </v>

2250
01:59:15.011 --> 01:59:18.340
<v Speaker 3>pinnacle and then it was the Dutch men </v>
<v Speaker 3>below them.</v>

2251
01:59:18.400 --> 01:59:19.233
<v Speaker 3>Now the women were in a minority and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were probably a little more highly </v>

2252
01:59:21.251 --> 01:59:22.031
<v Speaker 3>selected,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2253
01:59:22.031 --> 01:59:24.040
<v Speaker 3>So maybe that accounted for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>performance gap.</v>

2254
01:59:24.370 --> 01:59:26.500
<v Speaker 3>And then underneath that there was </v>
<v Speaker 3>female,</v>

2255
01:59:26.501 --> 01:59:30.230
<v Speaker 3>non Western ethnic minority immigrants </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then below that were male,</v>

2256
01:59:30.231 --> 01:59:32.230
<v Speaker 3>non Western ethnic minority immigrants.</v>

2257
01:59:32.320 --> 01:59:35.460
<v Speaker 3>And there was a massive gap between the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Dutch women and the male,</v>

2258
01:59:35.500 --> 01:59:36.333
<v Speaker 3>non Western minority immigrants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if performance gap of about 80% a </v>

2259
01:59:39.581 --> 01:59:44.581
<v Speaker 3>massive gap within two years after </v>
<v Speaker 3>writing the future authoring program.</v>

2260
01:59:44.920 --> 01:59:49.120
<v Speaker 3>The male non-ethnic Western minority </v>
<v Speaker 3>students pass the Dutch students.</v>

2261
01:59:49.450 --> 01:59:50.283
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And some of them didn't even remember </v>

2262
01:59:51.311 --> 01:59:53.260
<v Speaker 3>that they had done the future authoring </v>
<v Speaker 3>exercise.</v>

2263
01:59:53.440 --> 01:59:56.100
<v Speaker 3>And we replicated that at Mohawk </v>
<v Speaker 3>College.</v>

2264
01:59:56.110 --> 01:59:57.850
<v Speaker 3>Just a while back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same thing.</v>

2265
01:59:58.270 --> 02:00:00.280
<v Speaker 3>The young men who went to Mohawk </v>
<v Speaker 3>College,</v>

2266
02:00:00.281 --> 02:00:03.340
<v Speaker 3>they did this exercise in the summer </v>
<v Speaker 3>just before they went to college.</v>

2267
02:00:03.770 --> 02:00:05.950
<v Speaker 3>They only took about an hour to write </v>
<v Speaker 3>out their future.</v>

2268
02:00:06.100 --> 02:00:08.320
<v Speaker 3>It's not that long to think about your </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole future.</v>

2269
02:00:08.680 --> 02:00:09.513
<v Speaker 3>And what happened was that the young men</v>
<v Speaker 3>who had the worst grades in school who </v>

2270
02:00:13.901 --> 02:00:18.901
<v Speaker 3>are in non career oriented trajectories </v>
<v Speaker 3>had a retention improvement of about 40%</v>

2271
02:00:20.560 --> 02:00:22.300
<v Speaker 3>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that was just like,</v>

2272
02:00:22.510 --> 02:00:23.830
<v Speaker 3>we're just thrilled about that.</v>

2273
02:00:23.830 --> 02:00:24.663
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the reason I'm telling you all of </v>

2274
02:00:25.781 --> 02:00:26.614
<v Speaker 3>this story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>apart from the fact that it's vaguely </v>

2275
02:00:27.611 --> 02:00:29.270
<v Speaker 3>interesting is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2276
02:00:30.250 --> 02:00:34.090
<v Speaker 3>we are experimenting with technologies </v>
<v Speaker 3>to teach people how to write.</v>

2277
02:00:34.570 --> 02:00:35.403
<v Speaker 3>Now normally the way you're taught how </v>
<v Speaker 3>to write is by having someone edit your </v>

2278
02:00:37.481 --> 02:00:39.970
<v Speaker 3>writing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's prohibitively expensive.</v>

2279
02:00:40.420 --> 02:00:41.270
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2280
02:00:41.271 --> 02:00:44.770
<v Speaker 3>it can be transformed in something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's available on a mass basis.</v>

2281
02:00:44.771 --> 02:00:45.604
<v Speaker 3>And so what we're trying to do is to </v>
<v Speaker 3>break down the process of writing into </v>

2282
02:00:48.641 --> 02:00:49.474
<v Speaker 3>its requisite steps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of what behavioral </v>

2283
02:00:50.741 --> 02:00:51.574
<v Speaker 3>psychologists do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've done that already a bit with </v>

2284
02:00:52.841 --> 02:00:55.030
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with this essay writing format,</v>

2285
02:00:55.510 --> 02:00:56.343
<v Speaker 3>and then to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to sort of teach people what the </v>

2286
02:00:58.001 --> 02:00:58.834
<v Speaker 3>mechanics of writing actually are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then maybe to try to figure out how </v>

2287
02:01:01.361 --> 02:01:02.194
<v Speaker 3>to crowdsource editing so that many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many people can participate in the </v>

2288
02:01:05.171 --> 02:01:06.004
<v Speaker 3>process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we'd like to set up an online </v>

2289
02:01:07.721 --> 02:01:09.850
<v Speaker 3>humanities university over the next 10 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

2290
02:01:09.970 --> 02:01:13.720
<v Speaker 3>And since the universities have </v>
<v Speaker 3>abandoned their intellectual property,</v>

2291
02:01:13.721 --> 02:01:16.540
<v Speaker 3>there's no reason not to just move in </v>
<v Speaker 3>and take it as far as I can tell.</v>

2292
02:01:16.660 --> 02:01:18.460
<v Speaker 3>So that's the plan.</v>

2293
02:01:24.070 --> 02:01:24.870
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank you.</v>

2294
02:01:24.870 --> 02:01:25.850
<v Speaker 2>Thank you very much for,</v>

2295
02:01:27.220 --> 02:01:29.830
<v Speaker 3>thank you very much for coming out and </v>
<v Speaker 3>listening to me.</v>

2296
02:01:29.831 --> 02:01:30.610
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2298
02:01:33.941 --> 02:01:34.751
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
