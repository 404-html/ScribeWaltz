<v Speaker 1>I'm in the UK at Penguin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I'm thrilled about because I think</v>

2
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:06.143
<v Speaker 1>penguin is the greatest book publisher </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world and and England is the </v>

3
00:00:09.691 --> 00:00:10.524
<v Speaker 1>center of the English language and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really something because England </v>

4
00:00:14.041 --> 00:00:14.874
<v Speaker 1>has brought a tradition of truth and </v>
<v Speaker 1>clarity to the world that has </v>

5
00:00:19.471 --> 00:00:24.471
<v Speaker 1>illuminated it in many ways and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>hoping that this book extends that great</v>

6
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.810
<v Speaker 1>English tradition one step farther,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a good colonial should.</v>

7
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.273
<v Speaker 1>So that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I hope you read it and I hope that </v>

8
00:00:35.851 --> 00:00:36.684
<v Speaker 1>it helps you sort out your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people have found the things </v>

9
00:00:40.471 --> 00:00:41.304
<v Speaker 1>that I've said helpful in that regard </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've tried to distill them and </v>

10
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.170
<v Speaker 1>extend them in this book and deepen </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

11
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.220
<v Speaker 1>So hopefully that's what you will find </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you read it.</v>
