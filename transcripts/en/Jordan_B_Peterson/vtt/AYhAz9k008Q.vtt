1
00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.950
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going</v>

2
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.710
<v Speaker 1>to hear about psychology as a career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a career</v>

3
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.170
<v Speaker 1>for nine to five</v>
<v Speaker 1>job</v>

4
00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.530
<v Speaker 1>where if someone else tells you what to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

5
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.760
<v Speaker 1>and usually it's fairly similar to that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that</v>

6
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.460
<v Speaker 1>someone else tells you what to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>because</v>

7
00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.170
<v Speaker 1>if someone else is telling you what to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

8
00:01:58.171 --> 00:02:02.420
<v Speaker 1>then you don't have to figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you work from nine to five at</v>

9
00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:03.450
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're done.</v>

10
00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.900
<v Speaker 1>If you have a career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're never doubt.</v>

11
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.880
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that I want to give</v>
<v Speaker 1>some consideration to when you were</v>

12
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.490
<v Speaker 1>fighting for here is how we learn to</v>
<v Speaker 1>tolerate never being done.</v>

13
00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.450
<v Speaker 1>I think I went to graduate school in</v>
<v Speaker 1>1985 and I think the first time I was</v>

14
00:02:24.451 --> 00:02:28.500
<v Speaker 1>caught out</v>
<v Speaker 1>might be this year,</v>

15
00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.720
<v Speaker 1>but maybe it happened five years ago</v>
<v Speaker 1>once or twice to talk to me</v>

16
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:39.930
<v Speaker 1>30 years to catch up.</v>

17
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.390
<v Speaker 1>So I was behind for 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's um,</v>

18
00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:49.020
<v Speaker 1>it's hard on your nerves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have to accustom yourself to the</v>

19
00:02:49.021 --> 00:02:52.110
<v Speaker 1>fact of the matter how much you work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not enough.</v>

20
00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.580
<v Speaker 1>And maybe you're starting to accustom</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself to that in the universe.</v>

21
00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.030
<v Speaker 1>But the thing about university that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>different from the rest of your life is</v>

22
00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:04.630
<v Speaker 1>that although you already are facing</v>
<v Speaker 1>facing problem with that,</v>

23
00:03:04.631 --> 00:03:08.640
<v Speaker 1>there's way more to learn and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever going to be able to manage the</v>

24
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.810
<v Speaker 1>won't be first and then you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsible to at the moment is</v>

25
00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.820
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally apart from your parents to</v>
<v Speaker 1>some limited degree is yourself.</v>

26
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.230
<v Speaker 1>Whereas once you start developing your</v>
<v Speaker 1>career,</v>

27
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.730
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be responsible for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>larger and larger and larger number of</v>

28
00:03:24.731 --> 00:03:26.950
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some of them will depend on you for</v>

29
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.550
<v Speaker 1>four actions that well if you're a</v>
<v Speaker 1>clinical psychologist sometimes that</v>

30
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.570
<v Speaker 1>their lives depend on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so your responsibility level continues</v>

31
00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.610
<v Speaker 1>to decline as far as I'm concerned.</v>

32
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.110
<v Speaker 1>That's a really good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People and the fate,</v>

33
00:03:42.111 --> 00:03:46.000
<v Speaker 1>that responsibilities of a burden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

34
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.960
<v Speaker 1>and I suppose that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what the realize is that human</v>

35
00:03:49.961 --> 00:03:54.961
<v Speaker 1>beings are like sled dogs are pack mules</v>
<v Speaker 1>were not happy generally seeking and the</v>

36
00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.150
<v Speaker 1>lettuce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless we're shouldering the burden of</v>

37
00:04:02.161 --> 00:04:05.200
<v Speaker 1>carrying the load,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess as part of being a social</v>

38
00:04:05.201 --> 00:04:07.990
<v Speaker 1>animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's actually good.</v>

39
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.140
<v Speaker 1>You have the opportunity to shoulder</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility because it helps you</v>

40
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.910
<v Speaker 1>tolerate and living with yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be worth something in order</v>

41
00:04:18.911 --> 00:04:23.911
<v Speaker 1>to really</v>
<v Speaker 1>tolerate the conditions of your</v>

42
00:04:24.731 --> 00:04:27.910
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you've got to pick up something</v>

43
00:04:27.911 --> 00:04:32.410
<v Speaker 1>heavy and carry it because then that</v>
<v Speaker 1>helps you develop some respect for</v>

44
00:04:32.411 --> 00:04:36.880
<v Speaker 1>yourself and also for the table and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a big deal that's worth more than</v>

45
00:04:36.881 --> 00:04:39.470
<v Speaker 1>anything that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything else that will possibly be able</v>

46
00:04:39.471 --> 00:04:42.340
<v Speaker 1>to point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

47
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.250
<v Speaker 1>how many of you are you in your first</v>
<v Speaker 1>year?</v>

48
00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.530
<v Speaker 1>Put up your hand from seat because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>need to know what I'm talking second,</v>

49
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.120
<v Speaker 1>third and fourth year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of you were in third and fourth</v>

50
00:04:57.791 --> 00:05:01.060
<v Speaker 1>year are so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're thinking pretty hard about</v>

51
00:05:01.061 --> 00:05:05.020
<v Speaker 1>what to do so well we'll start with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>course supports your students for those</v>

52
00:05:05.021 --> 00:05:07.750
<v Speaker 1>that you want to apply it in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Graduate School,</v>

53
00:05:07.751 --> 00:05:09.790
<v Speaker 1>which is of course I suppose what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to do.</v>

54
00:05:09.791 --> 00:05:12.670
<v Speaker 1>Most of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to pursue psychology as a</v>

55
00:05:12.671 --> 00:05:16.390
<v Speaker 1>career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>better have a's as if you don't have</v>

56
00:05:16.391 --> 00:05:17.590
<v Speaker 1>aids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be rough.</v>

57
00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.520
<v Speaker 1>It might be rough even if you do have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a's,</v>

58
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.880
<v Speaker 1>but it's unbelievably competitive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in clinical psychology and</v>

59
00:05:24.881 --> 00:05:28.420
<v Speaker 1>it's increasingly the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this isn't such good news for those</v>

60
00:05:28.421 --> 00:05:32.010
<v Speaker 1>of you in your third and fourth and your</v>
<v Speaker 1>fifth admissions committees in</v>

61
00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:36.400
<v Speaker 1>universities are starting to look before</v>
<v Speaker 1>your last two years.</v>

62
00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.550
<v Speaker 1>They're really only supposed to look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>your last two years because everyone</v>

63
00:05:39.551 --> 00:05:43.270
<v Speaker 1>knows that the students,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's reasonable to allow incoming</v>

64
00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.600
<v Speaker 1>university students or a year or two the</v>
<v Speaker 1>scream their heads on straight before</v>

65
00:05:46.601 --> 00:05:50.350
<v Speaker 1>you start determining whether their</v>
<v Speaker 1>performance is actually an indication of</v>

66
00:05:50.351 --> 00:05:53.740
<v Speaker 1>their ability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So generally drives the committees are</v>

67
00:05:53.741 --> 00:05:55.540
<v Speaker 1>only supposed to look at the last two</v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

68
00:05:55.541 --> 00:06:00.170
<v Speaker 1>but it's getting competitive enough so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're looking farther back.</v>

69
00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.570
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clinical psychology requires aids.</v>

70
00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:09.290
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then of course all you have to take</v>

71
00:06:09.291 --> 00:06:11.950
<v Speaker 1>your driving record exam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

72
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.340
<v Speaker 1>there's two of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the standard grocery gripping</v>

73
00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.450
<v Speaker 1>examiners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the psychology specialty,</v>

74
00:06:17.451 --> 00:06:20.620
<v Speaker 1>drag aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most many universities don't want</v>

75
00:06:20.621 --> 00:06:23.570
<v Speaker 1>required a psychology graduate record</v>
<v Speaker 1>exam.</v>

76
00:06:23.571 --> 00:06:26.570
<v Speaker 1>I would strongly remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would strongly recommend that all of</v>

77
00:06:26.571 --> 00:06:29.060
<v Speaker 1>you take it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's your friend.</v>

78
00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.890
<v Speaker 1>If you're a psychology student from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>University of Toronto and have done</v>

79
00:06:33.891 --> 00:06:36.490
<v Speaker 1>reasonably well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the prob nick probability is high,</v>

80
00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:41.530
<v Speaker 1>but just ace it because it tests</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge that you've acquired as a</v>

81
00:06:41.931 --> 00:06:43.190
<v Speaker 1>psychology student.</v>

82
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.890
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the gre,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the general gre tests,</v>

83
00:06:45.891 --> 00:06:49.040
<v Speaker 1>more general knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including mathematics or arithmetic and</v>

84
00:06:49.041 --> 00:06:52.120
<v Speaker 1>mathematical knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's not as easy to acquire.</v>

85
00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:57.450
<v Speaker 1>But about site students at ut asis</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology garage was record exam fairly</v>

86
00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.490
<v Speaker 1>frequently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even if the university or</v>

87
00:07:01.491 --> 00:07:04.010
<v Speaker 1>universities that you were applying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't require it,</v>

88
00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.720
<v Speaker 1>you might as well take it and send it to</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

89
00:07:05.721 --> 00:07:08.810
<v Speaker 1>Because if you have a stellar 97th</v>
<v Speaker 1>percentile,</v>

90
00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:12.590
<v Speaker 1>then you know why don't want to include</v>
<v Speaker 1>the information in your package.</v>

91
00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:18.640
<v Speaker 1>So if you score less than 80th</v>
<v Speaker 1>percentile on the verbal portion of the</v>

92
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:22.580
<v Speaker 1>General Gre,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would strongly recommend that you</v>

93
00:07:22.581 --> 00:07:27.050
<v Speaker 1>don't consider a psychology as a career</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's unbelievably writing</v>

94
00:07:27.051 --> 00:07:30.950
<v Speaker 1>intensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it'll go the into the variety into</v>

95
00:07:30.951 --> 00:07:33.710
<v Speaker 1>the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people are pretty smart</v>

96
00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:36.350
<v Speaker 1>mathematically and analytically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when they write the gre,</v>

97
00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.440
<v Speaker 1>they do well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do better on the nonverbal parts.</v>

98
00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:44.210
<v Speaker 1>And I've had students like that who were</v>
<v Speaker 1>really powerful intellectually,</v>

99
00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.170
<v Speaker 1>but more non verbally God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deeper,</v>

100
00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:50.090
<v Speaker 1>greatest statistics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they can be really good analytical</v>

101
00:07:50.091 --> 00:07:52.370
<v Speaker 1>thinkers about the writing just killed</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

102
00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:56.600
<v Speaker 1>You have to run all the time as an</v>
<v Speaker 1>academic psychologist and you have to be</v>

103
00:07:56.601 --> 00:08:00.730
<v Speaker 1>very verbal as a clinical psychologist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're not up and up,</v>

104
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:05.750
<v Speaker 1>I would say top 50 percentile of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are taking the Gres,</v>

105
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.350
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be a real variety for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should think about that very</v>

106
00:08:09.351 --> 00:08:14.351
<v Speaker 1>seriously because it's the writing is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most difficult part of psychology as</v>

107
00:08:14.601 --> 00:08:17.240
<v Speaker 1>an academic career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're not a fluid writer,</v>

108
00:08:17.241 --> 00:08:19.040
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have one miserable</v>
<v Speaker 1>prime.</v>

109
00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:22.340
<v Speaker 1>You're going to drag your way through</v>
<v Speaker 1>graduate school and you're not going to</v>

110
00:08:22.341 --> 00:08:25.880
<v Speaker 1>be productive because writing ability</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually determines research</v>

111
00:08:25.881 --> 00:08:29.300
<v Speaker 1>productivity more than anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're not productive,</v>

112
00:08:29.301 --> 00:08:30.860
<v Speaker 1>you won't do well on the job market.</v>

113
00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:35.920
<v Speaker 1>And so it's to something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no sense sending yourself off</v>

114
00:08:36.291 --> 00:08:37.124
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

115
00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:40.220
<v Speaker 1>a six year Brian and then a dismal</v>
<v Speaker 1>outcomes.</v>

116
00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:46.030
<v Speaker 1>So students who aren't as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are more intellectually powerful on</v>

117
00:08:47.481 --> 00:08:51.640
<v Speaker 1>the nonverbals sections of the gre are</v>
<v Speaker 1>often pretty good at designing</v>

118
00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:55.220
<v Speaker 1>experiments and they can often learn how</v>
<v Speaker 1>to analyze the data too.</v>

119
00:08:55.221 --> 00:08:59.520
<v Speaker 1>And that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's pause his graduate students to</v>

120
00:08:59.521 --> 00:09:04.521
<v Speaker 1>stumble this writing up the papers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I often have students too who</v>

121
00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:06.910
<v Speaker 1>baby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

122
00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:11.640
<v Speaker 1>completed 10 or 11 studies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not planting to finish their</v>

123
00:09:11.641 --> 00:09:12.730
<v Speaker 1>darker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't publish,</v>

124
00:09:12.731 --> 00:09:13.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

125
00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:16.680
<v Speaker 1>several papers but they just cannot</v>
<v Speaker 1>break them up.</v>

126
00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:21.300
<v Speaker 1>And so then they language because no one</v>
<v Speaker 1>else is going to do it.</v>

127
00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:26.070
<v Speaker 1>So if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're verbally oriented,</v>

128
00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:27.600
<v Speaker 1>that's a good thing.</v>

129
00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:34.050
<v Speaker 1>Don't be thinking that you get to pick</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you're going to graduate school</v>

130
00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.930
<v Speaker 1>because you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you think that you get to pick</v>

131
00:09:36.931 --> 00:09:40.270
<v Speaker 1>where you're going to graduate school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you're a straight 4.0 students</v>

132
00:09:40.271 --> 00:09:44.370
<v Speaker 1>with 99% of the Uris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're setting yourself up for</v>

133
00:09:44.371 --> 00:09:48.660
<v Speaker 1>disappointment because it's so</v>
<v Speaker 1>competitive that what you do is you</v>

134
00:09:48.661 --> 00:09:51.750
<v Speaker 1>apply to every bloody place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Love half a chance of getting into</v>

135
00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:54.510
<v Speaker 1>including prices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you think you'd ever go?</v>

136
00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:57.000
<v Speaker 1>I think lake had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

137
00:09:57.001 --> 00:09:59.760
<v Speaker 1>has a clinical program now I've got</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing against weight yet,</v>

138
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:02.730
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a small universities have real</v>

139
00:10:02.731 --> 00:10:07.600
<v Speaker 1>advantages sometimes because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're less anonymous at small</v>

140
00:10:07.601 --> 00:10:08.850
<v Speaker 1>universities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you might think,</v>

141
00:10:08.851 --> 00:10:10.300
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd never go late as well.</v>

142
00:10:10.301 --> 00:10:13.530
<v Speaker 1>And you might be also thinking then they</v>
<v Speaker 1>will never go to the clinical graduate</v>

143
00:10:13.531 --> 00:10:16.860
<v Speaker 1>school because that could easily be the</v>
<v Speaker 1>only place that you'll get in.</v>

144
00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:19.590
<v Speaker 1>So what you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you want to go to clinical</v>

145
00:10:19.591 --> 00:10:22.710
<v Speaker 1>graduate school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is you apply every single place that you</v>

146
00:10:22.711 --> 00:10:25.320
<v Speaker 1>can in Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether you think you build,</v>

147
00:10:25.321 --> 00:10:28.200
<v Speaker 1>they're not can always say no if they</v>
<v Speaker 1>accept you.</v>

148
00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:29.670
<v Speaker 1>But if it's one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

149
00:10:29.671 --> 00:10:33.990
<v Speaker 1>maybe maybe it'll turn out at one place</v>
<v Speaker 1>accepts you and that's a place he didn't</v>

150
00:10:33.991 --> 00:10:36.390
<v Speaker 1>think you want to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well there's a big difference between</v>

151
00:10:36.391 --> 00:10:38.630
<v Speaker 1>being in clinical graduates who are not</v>
<v Speaker 1>using it.</v>

152
00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:41.100
<v Speaker 1>It's the difference between zero and</v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

153
00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:45.660
<v Speaker 1>And so if you go off to lakehead and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>come up with a clinical phd and you're a</v>

154
00:10:45.661 --> 00:10:48.870
<v Speaker 1>clinical psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so who the hell cares if you have to</v>

155
00:10:48.871 --> 00:10:53.871
<v Speaker 1>spend five years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know in somewhere that isn't a trend</v>

156
00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:56.430
<v Speaker 1>in urban setting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be sitting in a box most</v>

157
00:10:56.431 --> 00:10:59.310
<v Speaker 1>of the time anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's made out of cinder blocks doing</v>

158
00:10:59.311 --> 00:11:01.810
<v Speaker 1>your experiments and most of your life</v>
<v Speaker 1>fill fee,</v>

159
00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:03.680
<v Speaker 1>the social life of graduate students</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>

160
00:11:03.681 --> 00:11:05.400
<v Speaker 1>so it's not like you're going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>missing anything.</v>

161
00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:10.470
<v Speaker 1>One of the things you might want to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're fortunate enough to get</v>

162
00:11:10.471 --> 00:11:12.990
<v Speaker 1>accepted and you're not sure where they</v>
<v Speaker 1>would want to go,</v>

163
00:11:12.991 --> 00:11:16.950
<v Speaker 1>just to go talk to whoever's going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>your supervisor because more than</v>

164
00:11:16.951 --> 00:11:21.750
<v Speaker 1>anything else you ever do in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say if you go to Raji school,</v>

165
00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:26.010
<v Speaker 1>you're an apprentice to a supervisor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not a member of it department.</v>

166
00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:30.790
<v Speaker 1>So your relationship with your</v>
<v Speaker 1>supervisor basically determines whether</v>

167
00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:35.160
<v Speaker 1>graduate school works for you or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you want to find out ahead of the</v>

168
00:11:35.161 --> 00:11:38.490
<v Speaker 1>time if possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether the person who wants to work</v>

169
00:11:38.491 --> 00:11:42.900
<v Speaker 1>with you as someone who then who is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who you're,</v>

170
00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:47.700
<v Speaker 1>who you think you can get along with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they're working on is less critical</v>

171
00:11:47.701 --> 00:11:50.910
<v Speaker 1>I think because it's not if you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you want to do research or you</v>

172
00:11:50.911 --> 00:11:52.800
<v Speaker 1>might think you do but you don't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to,</v>

173
00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:58.330
<v Speaker 1>so I would also strongly suggest that</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you write your applications for</v>

174
00:11:58.331 --> 00:12:02.590
<v Speaker 1>graduate school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make the person tell people who</v>

175
00:12:02.591 --> 00:12:04.270
<v Speaker 1>you're writing to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who you are,</v>

176
00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:10.380
<v Speaker 1>but don't specify a research interest</v>
<v Speaker 1>too closely because hardly anyone is</v>

177
00:12:10.751 --> 00:12:12.010
<v Speaker 1>doing half research.</v>

178
00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:16.000
<v Speaker 1>And why give people an excuse not to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take you.</v>

179
00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:20.290
<v Speaker 1>You're looking for an excuse not to take</v>
<v Speaker 1>you 81 so if I'm looking for graduate</v>

180
00:12:20.291 --> 00:12:23.380
<v Speaker 1>students,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a staff of a hundred applications</v>

181
00:12:23.381 --> 00:12:27.750
<v Speaker 1>or maybe 150 I get rid of 75 of those so</v>
<v Speaker 1>fast that they might've,</v>

182
00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.260
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>might as well have not even apply.</v>

183
00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:32.950
<v Speaker 1>They're just gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually what I do is I make a</v>

184
00:12:32.951 --> 00:12:37.180
<v Speaker 1>spreadsheet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put in grades and the gre scores and I</v>

185
00:12:37.181 --> 00:12:41.080
<v Speaker 1>called the lenders have breakfast and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>some across the rank order them,</v>

186
00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:45.160
<v Speaker 1>I knock off the bar and everyone else</v>
<v Speaker 1>does that too.</v>

187
00:12:45.161 --> 00:12:47.050
<v Speaker 1>Even though they might not do it in such</v>
<v Speaker 1>a</v>

188
00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:52.270
<v Speaker 1>quantitative way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they should because that's the most</v>

189
00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:57.010
<v Speaker 1>efficient and accurate way of doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But everyone else looks at that pile of</v>

190
00:12:57.011 --> 00:12:59.070
<v Speaker 1>resumes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more to do the same thing.</v>

191
00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:00.513
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

192
00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:08.390
<v Speaker 1>so you're already 50% of the people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>applied,</v>

193
00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:11.090
<v Speaker 1>they weren't going to get in it like</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>

194
00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:14.930
<v Speaker 1>that's already cop caught.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He don't want off of this type of</v>

195
00:13:14.931 --> 00:13:16.130
<v Speaker 1>statement of interest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says,</v>

196
00:13:16.131 --> 00:13:17.200
<v Speaker 1>well I just want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

197
00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:21.440
<v Speaker 1>look at the left hemisphere where hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have specialization for second</v>

198
00:13:21.441 --> 00:13:25.520
<v Speaker 1>language learners who are children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's probably one person in North</v>

199
00:13:25.521 --> 00:13:28.310
<v Speaker 1>America studying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so anyone else who might be</v>

200
00:13:28.311 --> 00:13:31.970
<v Speaker 1>interested in your application because</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your qualifications could still look</v>

201
00:13:31.971 --> 00:13:33.380
<v Speaker 1>at that and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well he didn't want to work with me.</v>

202
00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:38.240
<v Speaker 1>And then you're out deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can say what you work on or be</v>

203
00:13:38.241 --> 00:13:41.450
<v Speaker 1>interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what you should do.</v>

204
00:13:41.451 --> 00:13:45.090
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not asking you to falsify your</v>
<v Speaker 1>letter if at 10 because that's foolish.</v>

205
00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:50.410
<v Speaker 1>But what I would take you to consider is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you don't know that much about</v>

206
00:13:52.281 --> 00:13:53.390
<v Speaker 1>psychology and</v>

207
00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:57.650
<v Speaker 1>why did you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When did you specialize as a graduate</v>

208
00:13:57.651 --> 00:14:00.200
<v Speaker 1>student is you started to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in a sexy,</v>

209
00:14:00.201 --> 00:14:04.250
<v Speaker 1>narrow as you start off with without a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of knowledge about one specific</v>

210
00:14:04.251 --> 00:14:07.220
<v Speaker 1>topic as you narrowed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it comes a time when you start to</v>

211
00:14:07.221 --> 00:14:10.640
<v Speaker 1>broaden out again cause you get into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>seal talking deeply enough.</v>

212
00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:15.440
<v Speaker 1>So you started acting starting to tech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start to have to consider the</v>

213
00:14:15.441 --> 00:14:17.930
<v Speaker 1>contextual issues that surround that</v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee.</v>

214
00:14:17.931 --> 00:14:19.830
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you are a saint richards</v>

215
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.370
<v Speaker 1>neuroscience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you ended up studying language</v>

216
00:14:22.371 --> 00:14:24.560
<v Speaker 1>development as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At some point you're going to run into</v>

217
00:14:24.561 --> 00:14:26.180
<v Speaker 1>the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

218
00:14:26.181 --> 00:14:31.181
<v Speaker 1>Because language development depends on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so psychology and since it's an</v>

219
00:14:31.311 --> 00:14:34.360
<v Speaker 1>amorphous feel and there's an entry</v>
<v Speaker 1>points,</v>

220
00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:38.640
<v Speaker 1>all the entry points are narrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But once you pass through the narrow</v>

221
00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:40.280
<v Speaker 1>your point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in the field.</v>

222
00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:45.020
<v Speaker 1>So it doesn't matter that much</v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically what you'd be doing your</v>

223
00:14:45.021 --> 00:14:47.240
<v Speaker 1>work on for your master's degree in</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular,</v>

224
00:14:47.241 --> 00:14:49.490
<v Speaker 1>cause you don't do enough to specify</v>
<v Speaker 1>that at all.</v>

225
00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:51.190
<v Speaker 1>And you'll be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're fortunate,</v>

226
00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:54.430
<v Speaker 1>your supervisor will basically tell him</v>
<v Speaker 1>what to do for your master's degree.</v>

227
00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:56.060
<v Speaker 1>It always takes a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

228
00:14:56.630 --> 00:15:00.110
<v Speaker 1>Well it takes you two months just to</v>
<v Speaker 1>clue in when you first started a new</v>

229
00:15:00.111 --> 00:15:03.500
<v Speaker 1>program and then you're already a</v>
<v Speaker 1>quarter of the way through the first</v>

230
00:15:03.501 --> 00:15:06.500
<v Speaker 1>semester somebody hurting us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That pretty much has to hand you a</v>

231
00:15:06.501 --> 00:15:11.501
<v Speaker 1>project and you have to walk through it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what it's about is important as</v>

232
00:15:12.021 --> 00:15:14.840
<v Speaker 1>the fact that it's at hand and you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>done it.</v>

233
00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:18.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying this well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what you're interested in doesn't</v>

234
00:15:18.141 --> 00:15:20.120
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It matters an awful lot,</v>

235
00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:22.950
<v Speaker 1>but you don't want to prematurely and</v>
<v Speaker 1>narrow.</v>

236
00:15:22.951 --> 00:15:26.690
<v Speaker 1>We specify you're building an interest</v>
<v Speaker 1>when what you're relying on is</v>

237
00:15:26.691 --> 00:15:30.230
<v Speaker 1>information that's not all that reliable</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're not an expert enough in</v>

238
00:15:30.231 --> 00:15:33.800
<v Speaker 1>psychology where it needs to make that</v>
<v Speaker 1>have determined the decision about what</v>

239
00:15:33.801 --> 00:15:34.850
<v Speaker 1>it is that you're going to study.</v>

240
00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:38.030
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have enough 70 all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>things I never thought I would study.</v>

241
00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:41.730
<v Speaker 1>Things I didn't think were were studying</v>
<v Speaker 1>that turned out to be wrong.</v>

242
00:15:41.731 --> 00:15:43.580
<v Speaker 1>We were plenty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're studying an intern up to the</v>

243
00:15:43.581 --> 00:15:47.000
<v Speaker 1>necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So um,</v>

244
00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:51.370
<v Speaker 1>learn your bloody stats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should be a wizard with spss or some</v>

245
00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:53.480
<v Speaker 1>others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the computer program.</v>

246
00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:56.870
<v Speaker 1>From an economic perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing that you'll learn as a</v>

247
00:15:56.871 --> 00:15:59.810
<v Speaker 1>psychology graduate students that's more</v>
<v Speaker 1>valuable than statistics.</v>

248
00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:04.780
<v Speaker 1>If you use statistics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the all sorts of things open up to you</v>

249
00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:09.650
<v Speaker 1>don't know the experimental work and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to be a statistical expert really</v>

250
00:16:09.651 --> 00:16:13.970
<v Speaker 1>could be a good scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Cross disciplinary collaboration</v>

251
00:16:13.971 --> 00:16:16.940
<v Speaker 1>because most other social sciences stoke</v>
<v Speaker 1>half here,</v>

252
00:16:16.941 --> 00:16:21.560
<v Speaker 1>this statistical expertise that</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologists do consulting for</v>

253
00:16:21.561 --> 00:16:22.640
<v Speaker 1>businesses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

254
00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:26.780
<v Speaker 1>there's all sorts of value in doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>statistics and understanding.</v>

255
00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:29.750
<v Speaker 1>So for those of you who are in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>earlier years,</v>

256
00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:33.230
<v Speaker 1>don't shy away from statistics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the more practical end of it,</v>

257
00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.870
<v Speaker 1>which would be the computer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

258
00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.670
<v Speaker 1>the pc or Mac programs.</v>

259
00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:41.180
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say pc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>generally pc programs that enable you to</v>

260
00:16:41.181 --> 00:16:43.380
<v Speaker 1>do statistics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should get good at that part in</v>

261
00:16:43.381 --> 00:16:45.260
<v Speaker 1>someone who will teach you how to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>statistics.</v>

262
00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:50.480
<v Speaker 1>Statistics is actually extremely</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting once you start looking at</v>

263
00:16:50.481 --> 00:16:55.000
<v Speaker 1>your own data because it's a lot more</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I mean that technically at all.</v>

264
00:16:55.001 --> 00:16:58.160
<v Speaker 1>If you pull a slot machines arm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there isn't much of a chance that you're</v>

265
00:16:58.161 --> 00:17:00.710
<v Speaker 1>going to get a good outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for some channels and so it's</v>

266
00:17:00.711 --> 00:17:03.590
<v Speaker 1>exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A off is variable reinforcement and</v>

267
00:17:03.591 --> 00:17:07.430
<v Speaker 1>research is like that and statistics are</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly like that because maybe you've</v>

268
00:17:07.431 --> 00:17:12.431
<v Speaker 1>spent six months putting together a data</v>
<v Speaker 1>set and you are raising the variables to</v>

269
00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:17.660
<v Speaker 1>ask ess statistical machine so to speak</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you both handle it.</v>

270
00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:22.400
<v Speaker 1>Now you just learned ways or you wasted</v>
<v Speaker 1>your drive for six months or you hit the</v>

271
00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:24.570
<v Speaker 1>Jackpot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's actually pretty exciting.</v>

272
00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:27.940
<v Speaker 1>It's different when you're doing in</v>
<v Speaker 1>class or working on someone else's data</v>

273
00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:30.740
<v Speaker 1>set because what they know you care,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you've got,</v>

274
00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:33.890
<v Speaker 1>when you've got something in the game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an entirely different process.</v>

275
00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:37.610
<v Speaker 1>Should also tell you that statistics is</v>
<v Speaker 1>not arithmetic and it's not.</v>

276
00:17:37.611 --> 00:17:41.540
<v Speaker 1>Mathematics is more like surgery and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a moral endeavor,</v>

277
00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:43.520
<v Speaker 1>which is funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't think that was one</v>

278
00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:46.190
<v Speaker 1>statistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is a moral endeavor because there</v>

279
00:17:46.191 --> 00:17:51.191
<v Speaker 1>aren't any real rules for doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A data is an amorphous and vague entity</v>

280
00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:56.800
<v Speaker 1>and there might be information in it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>your job is to carve off the garbage and</v>

281
00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:59.430
<v Speaker 1>to keep down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to pull up the information that</v>

282
00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:03.570
<v Speaker 1>reporters doesn't require.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The automatic application of a set of</v>

283
00:18:03.571 --> 00:18:06.150
<v Speaker 1>statistical rules that just won't work</v>
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>

284
00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:10.260
<v Speaker 1>Your job is to figure out where the</v>
<v Speaker 1>truth is embedded in this messy thing</v>

285
00:18:10.261 --> 00:18:13.650
<v Speaker 1>that you just produced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this vertical study because most</v>

286
00:18:13.651 --> 00:18:16.620
<v Speaker 1>studies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're complete disasters you've never</v>

287
00:18:16.621 --> 00:18:19.140
<v Speaker 1>been or how to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right until you've already done it and</v>

288
00:18:19.141 --> 00:18:21.990
<v Speaker 1>so there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are mass and whether or not you're</v>

289
00:18:21.991 --> 00:18:24.720
<v Speaker 1>going to be able to pull something on</v>
<v Speaker 1>that mastic constitutes genuine</v>

290
00:18:24.721 --> 00:18:25.350
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

291
00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:30.350
<v Speaker 1>Depends on how skillful you aren't using</v>
<v Speaker 1>the statistical tools and how carefully</v>

292
00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:33.180
<v Speaker 1>you make your decisions ethically while</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were,</v>

293
00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:37.260
<v Speaker 1>you're attacking the data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because for example,</v>

294
00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:41.010
<v Speaker 1>there would be a pretty damn highly</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivated to come out with something</v>

295
00:18:41.011 --> 00:18:45.270
<v Speaker 1>where p is less than 0.05 right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because otherwise it's not technically</v>

296
00:18:45.271 --> 00:18:48.490
<v Speaker 1>publishable even though that's a rather</v>
<v Speaker 1>foolish criteria.</v>

297
00:18:48.491 --> 00:18:51.510
<v Speaker 1>But that's still the point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you put six months in the study</v>

298
00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:56.260
<v Speaker 1>and you know you have to decide where</v>
<v Speaker 1>the outliers are and where the masses</v>

299
00:18:56.310 --> 00:19:00.190
<v Speaker 1>who to throw out concentrate on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the little career day,</v>

300
00:19:00.191 --> 00:19:02.310
<v Speaker 1>we'll let the doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your mind is going to be pushing pretty</v>

301
00:19:02.311 --> 00:19:07.260
<v Speaker 1>hard in the direction of money with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>data in a way it makes what you want to</v>

302
00:19:07.261 --> 00:19:10.970
<v Speaker 1>come out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can bet that 40% of published</v>

303
00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:14.580
<v Speaker 1>studies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cited studies at least are absolutely no</v>

304
00:19:14.581 --> 00:19:19.581
<v Speaker 1>utility whatsoever because the way they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were produced was biased by the fact</v>

305
00:19:19.951 --> 00:19:22.710
<v Speaker 1>that the person growth of wanting to</v>
<v Speaker 1>publish the study.</v>

306
00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:25.750
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a terrible thing because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it works the whole feel,</v>

307
00:19:25.751 --> 00:19:29.140
<v Speaker 1>but it's even worse if you have to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>the person that's doing it because you</v>

308
00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:31.330
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fool yourself yourself into discovering</v>

309
00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:34.590
<v Speaker 1>something that isn't there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you will convince yourself that it</v>

310
00:19:34.591 --> 00:19:37.260
<v Speaker 1>is there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then just spend the next 15 years</v>

311
00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:40.950
<v Speaker 1>chasing something that doesn't exist and</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to prove to yourself and others</v>

312
00:19:40.951 --> 00:19:43.830
<v Speaker 1>that it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that accounts for a big chunk of</v>

313
00:19:43.831 --> 00:19:46.050
<v Speaker 1>what passes for psychology and</v>
<v Speaker 1>researches.</v>

314
00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:51.320
<v Speaker 1>It's a standard in some ways and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>journals are changing the way they</v>

315
00:19:52.051 --> 00:19:55.970
<v Speaker 1>accept papers right now because this</v>
<v Speaker 1>happens so frequently.</v>

316
00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:59.760
<v Speaker 1>So one of the way things want to do if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to be paid an academic</v>

317
00:19:59.761 --> 00:20:01.830
<v Speaker 1>psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you want to be a scientist as a</v>

318
00:20:01.831 --> 00:20:03.420
<v Speaker 1>careers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you benefit your,</v>

319
00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:05.010
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

320
00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:08.040
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to decide what it is that</v>

321
00:20:08.041 --> 00:20:08.970
<v Speaker 1>you're doing.</v>

322
00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:14.010
<v Speaker 1>And what I'm saying that you might be</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing is building a career which is a</v>

323
00:20:14.011 --> 00:20:15.690
<v Speaker 1>social enterprise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a proud name,</v>

324
00:20:15.691 --> 00:20:20.430
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy into for us and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means that what you're focusing on is</v>

325
00:20:20.431 --> 00:20:22.410
<v Speaker 1>climbing up a private,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a dominance hierarchy.</v>

326
00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:27.030
<v Speaker 1>That's not the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is trying to pursue truth insights.</v>

327
00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:30.630
<v Speaker 1>Those are completely different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you pursue the truth in science,</v>

328
00:20:30.631 --> 00:20:34.410
<v Speaker 1>you might also January and career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you generate a career,</v>

329
00:20:34.411 --> 00:20:39.240
<v Speaker 1>you might also pursue truth and science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the probability is relatively low.</v>

330
00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:41.880
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would suggest that you pursue truth in</v>

331
00:20:41.881 --> 00:20:43.680
<v Speaker 1>science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is,</v>

332
00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:45.181
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

333
00:20:45.181 --> 00:20:48.160
<v Speaker 1>you won't get corrupt and second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you corrupt other people,</v>

334
00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:51.850
<v Speaker 1>but perhaps more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from an existential perspective,</v>

335
00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:55.420
<v Speaker 1>20 years down the road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you won't look back at your life and be</v>

336
00:20:55.421 --> 00:20:59.020
<v Speaker 1>disgusted by the whole thing and sinful</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not even to teach or to talk to</v>

337
00:20:59.021 --> 00:21:02.200
<v Speaker 1>students or to be a good graduate</v>
<v Speaker 1>advisor because you're sick and tired of</v>

338
00:21:02.201 --> 00:21:03.970
<v Speaker 1>the whole business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

339
00:21:03.971 --> 00:21:06.900
<v Speaker 1>and that's exactly what happens to</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who could do things in a crop.</v>

340
00:21:06.901 --> 00:21:07.960
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's cynical.</v>

341
00:21:07.961 --> 00:21:11.410
<v Speaker 1>And why did it go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It shouldn't be cynical because they're</v>

342
00:21:11.411 --> 00:21:13.560
<v Speaker 1>the sorts of people that you should be</v>
<v Speaker 1>cynical about.</v>

343
00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:18.880
<v Speaker 1>So the other thing you should decide to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to pursue experimental</v>

344
00:21:18.881 --> 00:21:22.420
<v Speaker 1>psychology as a career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>duly you actually care about scientific</v>

345
00:21:22.421 --> 00:21:24.520
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that matter to you?</v>

346
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.120
<v Speaker 1>If the answer is no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say go into business.</v>

347
00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:33.070
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing wrong with going into</v>
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

348
00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:36.730
<v Speaker 1>I've got in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is important.</v>

349
00:21:36.731 --> 00:21:39.550
<v Speaker 1>It's not easy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you want,</v>

350
00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:44.470
<v Speaker 1>if what you're after is this sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>status that comes along with a business</v>

351
00:21:44.471 --> 00:21:46.300
<v Speaker 1>career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get hit.</v>

352
00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:47.480
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to have to be,</v>

353
00:21:47.481 --> 00:21:49.720
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might as well just go into business</v>

354
00:21:49.721 --> 00:21:51.910
<v Speaker 1>and do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to make much money as</v>

355
00:21:51.911 --> 00:21:56.911
<v Speaker 1>it as an experimental psychologist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're after status and the sort</v>

356
00:21:57.011 --> 00:22:00.790
<v Speaker 1>of status that comes along business and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sort of productivity and social</v>

357
00:22:00.791 --> 00:22:04.180
<v Speaker 1>relations that come along with fitness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just go into business.</v>

358
00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:05.710
<v Speaker 1>Don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do it.</v>

359
00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:10.780
<v Speaker 1>Don't sidetrack yourself off into</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's in a sense of more in</v>

360
00:22:10.781 --> 00:22:12.850
<v Speaker 1>pursuit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

361
00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:15.940
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so do your stats and get good at it.</v>

362
00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:18.400
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might be resentful about having to</v>

363
00:22:18.401 --> 00:22:22.820
<v Speaker 1>do it because a lot of people who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of oriented towards the humanistic</v>

364
00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:25.400
<v Speaker 1>psychology are pretty irritated folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>statistics.</v>

365
00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:28.240
<v Speaker 1>So I was certainly one of those people</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it didn't come naturally.</v>

366
00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:33.930
<v Speaker 1>But if you can't have to get a tutor and</v>
<v Speaker 1>hit age and take more stats courses,</v>

367
00:22:34.181 --> 00:22:36.160
<v Speaker 1>then you think you need because you'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>need them.</v>

368
00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:39.520
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you go onto graduate school and</v>

369
00:22:39.521 --> 00:22:44.350
<v Speaker 1>you're sort of crippled in terms of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to approach statistics,</v>

370
00:22:44.351 --> 00:22:46.860
<v Speaker 1>you'll pay the price for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll get an understanding of papers,</v>

371
00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:49.060
<v Speaker 1>we'll go do your own analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stab me.</v>

372
00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:53.980
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I everywhere,</v>

373
00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:55.181
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>

374
00:22:55.181 --> 00:22:56.620
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't afford to apply everywhere</v>

375
00:22:56.621 --> 00:23:00.000
<v Speaker 1>because each application is under $50</v>
<v Speaker 1>riding on this.</v>

376
00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:05.080
<v Speaker 1>What is it now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>$100 $150 that's silly.</v>

377
00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:07.420
<v Speaker 1>That's not a cost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an investment.</v>

378
00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:10.050
<v Speaker 1>And you need to distinguish between</v>
<v Speaker 1>costs and investments.</v>

379
00:23:10.051 --> 00:23:12.760
<v Speaker 1>And if you get in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you thinking?</v>

380
00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:16.960
<v Speaker 1>What are you think of?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Experiment a phd is worth,</v>

381
00:23:16.961 --> 00:23:19.360
<v Speaker 1>let's say you get an afternoon last</v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

382
00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:20.663
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

383
00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:26.223
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

384
00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:29.650
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it 100,000 for females?</v>

385
00:23:29.651 --> 00:23:31.090
<v Speaker 1>The doors?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think his work?</v>

386
00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:33.863
<v Speaker 2>Pardon?</v>

387
00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:35.763
<v Speaker 1>Ballpark.</v>

388
00:23:36.850 --> 00:23:37.683
<v Speaker 2>Saturday.</v>

389
00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:40.850
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's good for how many years</v>

390
00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:44.153
<v Speaker 1>maybe?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

391
00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:47.210
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's hundred freaking on the doors,</v>

392
00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:48.810
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's your tension word?</v>

393
00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:53.240
<v Speaker 1>Were other two and you were undressed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

394
00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:55.640
<v Speaker 1>you underestimate the salary in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>latter part of their career.</v>

395
00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:59.420
<v Speaker 1>So it was probably 7 million doors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

396
00:23:59.421 --> 00:24:01.460
<v Speaker 1>so now you know what you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in that,</v>

397
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.220
<v Speaker 1>you get that APP,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get that acceptance letter in the</v>

398
00:24:04.221 --> 00:24:06.170
<v Speaker 1>mail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's worth 7 million doors if you play</v>

399
00:24:06.171 --> 00:24:08.360
<v Speaker 1>it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're a clinical psychologist is</v>

400
00:24:08.361 --> 00:24:12.500
<v Speaker 1>probably worth twice that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're after a $14 million price,</v>

401
00:24:12.501 --> 00:24:14.690
<v Speaker 1>you ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well why is it so competitive while now?</v>

402
00:24:14.691 --> 00:24:17.240
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's so competitive.</v>

403
00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:19.880
<v Speaker 1>Lots of people would like to have $14</v>
<v Speaker 1>million.</v>

404
00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:24.080
<v Speaker 1>So it's hard to get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

405
00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:29.920
<v Speaker 1>so then if you're applying and it's $100</v>
<v Speaker 1>$150 let's say you've got a one in 10</v>

406
00:24:31.131 --> 00:24:35.000
<v Speaker 1>chance or one in 20 chance of getting in</v>
<v Speaker 1>and any given school.</v>

407
00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:37.460
<v Speaker 1>So let's see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you pay for a one in 20</v>

408
00:24:37.461 --> 00:24:39.200
<v Speaker 1>chance of $14 million?</v>

409
00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:47.290
<v Speaker 1>How would you calculate that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

410
00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:51.800
<v Speaker 1>14 million divided by 20 so you pay</v>
<v Speaker 1>about $700,000 something like that.</v>

411
00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:57.370
<v Speaker 1>So you pay $700,000 not a hundred so</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's have that because you were</v>

412
00:24:57.861 --> 00:25:00.050
<v Speaker 1>skeptical about your chances of winning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fine.</v>

413
00:25:00.051 --> 00:25:05.051
<v Speaker 1>So then you paid $350,000 well don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>Balk at 200 it's a bargain.</v>

414
00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:10.520
<v Speaker 1>And don't get too irritated about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>application process.</v>

415
00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:14.090
<v Speaker 1>It's annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to annoy you because if</v>

416
00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:17.120
<v Speaker 1>you get annoyed and quit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they won't have to look.</v>

417
00:25:17.121 --> 00:25:19.340
<v Speaker 1>You've got an application and that's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>end of you.</v>

418
00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:24.380
<v Speaker 1>So take a big amount of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do your application because they're</v>

419
00:25:24.381 --> 00:25:27.870
<v Speaker 1>really important and do lots of many is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the APP.</v>

420
00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:30.380
<v Speaker 1>If you can afford,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think about points,</v>

421
00:25:30.381 --> 00:25:34.700
<v Speaker 1>bdos throw some applications down there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's especially true if you're a hot</v>

422
00:25:34.701 --> 00:25:39.080
<v Speaker 1>student and you're a hot student.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you've got a basically an a average</v>

423
00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:44.350
<v Speaker 1>and the gre of 90 percentile or above,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people will be interested in you.</v>

424
00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:47.510
<v Speaker 1>And that means it might get a</v>
<v Speaker 1>scholarship to the American school or do</v>

425
00:25:47.511 --> 00:25:50.030
<v Speaker 1>you want to pay the tuition?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

426
00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:52.160
<v Speaker 1>and that might especially be the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't.</v>

427
00:25:52.161 --> 00:25:54.010
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you want me to go back with you at</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harvard,</v>

428
00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:56.600
<v Speaker 1>although little at night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's lots of state schools down</v>

429
00:25:56.601 --> 00:25:58.430
<v Speaker 1>there that are excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The big research schools,</v>

430
00:25:58.431 --> 00:26:01.010
<v Speaker 1>and maybe they'll paint it from down and</v>
<v Speaker 1>study.</v>

431
00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:06.550
<v Speaker 1>So not only do you get your crap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>70 million or $14 million,</v>

432
00:26:06.561 --> 00:26:09.110
<v Speaker 1>but someone will give you some money to</v>
<v Speaker 1>help you get it.</v>

433
00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:12.620
<v Speaker 1>So that's a pretty good deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So don't lays out all over the bloody</v>

434
00:26:12.621 --> 00:26:14.930
<v Speaker 1>applications.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really important.</v>

435
00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:22.050
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now local back to more general things</v>

436
00:26:22.281 --> 00:26:26.930
<v Speaker 1>for a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now we might want to talk about what</v>

437
00:26:26.931 --> 00:26:29.870
<v Speaker 1>makes people successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

438
00:26:29.871 --> 00:26:32.690
<v Speaker 1>And do you want also think about what</v>
<v Speaker 1>success means,</v>

439
00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:35.570
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what success means.</v>

440
00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:37.630
<v Speaker 1>I can give you a couple of rules of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thumb of both.</v>

441
00:26:37.631 --> 00:26:38.061
<v Speaker 1>Dot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

442
00:26:38.061 --> 00:26:40.430
<v Speaker 1>the first thing is if you want to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>successful,</v>

443
00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:42.560
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's put that,</v>

444
00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:44.580
<v Speaker 1>let's use a different phrase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we could say,</v>

445
00:26:44.581 --> 00:26:46.440
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say you want to have a good life.</v>

446
00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:51.390
<v Speaker 1>And I don't mean good in that it's happy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and easy or any of those things I need</v>

447
00:26:51.391 --> 00:26:54.070
<v Speaker 1>sorta hood classic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to have a platonic need.</v>

448
00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:55.590
<v Speaker 1>Good life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

449
00:26:55.591 --> 00:26:58.290
<v Speaker 1>so how would one go about doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

450
00:26:58.291 --> 00:27:03.291
<v Speaker 1>the first thing I would say is do what</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people do unless you have a really</v>

451
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.840
<v Speaker 1>good reason not to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what people,</v>

452
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:08.880
<v Speaker 1>what human beings do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a good life.</v>

453
00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:12.450
<v Speaker 1>They have friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a circle of friends,</v>

454
00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:14.730
<v Speaker 1>some of whom they can talk to.</v>

455
00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:18.310
<v Speaker 1>Careful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You help the important things.</v>

456
00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:21.430
<v Speaker 1>So you need that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have an intimate relationship</v>

457
00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:25.360
<v Speaker 1>with someone that is stable across time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

458
00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:29.590
<v Speaker 1>Well without that you're kind of chaotic</v>
<v Speaker 1>and loss and plus new when we have half</v>

459
00:27:29.770 --> 00:27:34.120
<v Speaker 1>your brain because people are pair</v>
<v Speaker 1>bonding animals and we're kind of</v>

460
00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:38.410
<v Speaker 1>communicative and if you have a partner</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can trust who's got your back</v>

461
00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:43.680
<v Speaker 1>that you can talk to and planning with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're twice as wise as the person</v>

462
00:27:44.171 --> 00:27:47.320
<v Speaker 1>that you're competing because it's just</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

463
00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:50.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is there sexual reproduction instead</v>

464
00:27:50.471 --> 00:27:52.560
<v Speaker 1>of coal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coal,</v>

465
00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:54.040
<v Speaker 1>reproduction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is that</v>

466
00:27:57.690 --> 00:27:59.610
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys are taking biology courses.</v>

467
00:27:59.611 --> 00:28:02.130
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty fundamental question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the answer to that?</v>

468
00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:06.850
<v Speaker 1>Variations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was part of it though,</v>

469
00:28:06.851 --> 00:28:07.511
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

470
00:28:07.511 --> 00:28:08.344
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

471
00:28:10.850 --> 00:28:13.940
<v Speaker 1>as a unit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you called yourself first of all the</v>

472
00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:17.210
<v Speaker 1>parasites to get again in no time flat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But apart from that,</v>

473
00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:21.110
<v Speaker 1>do you have a bunch of straight on to</v>
<v Speaker 1>weaknesses and they're kind of random</v>

474
00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:23.870
<v Speaker 1>and then you'll pair up with someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has to match the strengths and</v>

475
00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:24.870
<v Speaker 1>weaknesses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Eric,</v>

476
00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:27.470
<v Speaker 1>you ran it and hopefully when you pair</v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

477
00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:30.920
<v Speaker 1>most of the places you're weak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that person will be strong and vice</v>

478
00:28:30.921 --> 00:28:32.780
<v Speaker 1>versa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that makes you a much more,</v>

479
00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:35.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more properly solidified unit.</v>

480
00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:39.440
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes a weakness is a match and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where you will fight nonstop.</v>

481
00:28:39.650 --> 00:28:41.570
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll have to be a promise.</v>

482
00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:46.220
<v Speaker 1>You're a lot better off with somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's especially true if you also</v>

483
00:28:46.221 --> 00:28:49.040
<v Speaker 1>want to have children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're foolish enough to have</v>

484
00:28:49.041 --> 00:28:51.290
<v Speaker 1>children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know you guys,</v>

485
00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:57.380
<v Speaker 1>most of the women in your most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be under 25 so there's probably a</v>

486
00:28:57.381 --> 00:28:59.510
<v Speaker 1>fair number of people who think you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>not going to have children.</v>

487
00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:01.990
<v Speaker 1>Must have plenty of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll dispense with that foolish idea</v>

488
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.580
<v Speaker 1>right now because all that means is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just have your,</v>

489
00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:07.730
<v Speaker 1>you'd be more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one thing.</v>

490
00:29:07.731 --> 00:29:09.980
<v Speaker 1>It means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and second it means you don't know who</v>

491
00:29:09.981 --> 00:29:13.160
<v Speaker 1>the hell you are because my experience</v>
<v Speaker 1>is feeding it virtually.</v>

492
00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:15.560
<v Speaker 1>I think this is virtually without</v>
<v Speaker 1>exception.</v>

493
00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:18.440
<v Speaker 1>Every woman I'd ever met,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they thought they wanted</v>

494
00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:23.330
<v Speaker 1>children at the age of 21 or 22 or 23 or</v>
<v Speaker 1>24 if they were basically mentally</v>

495
00:29:23.331 --> 00:29:25.820
<v Speaker 1>healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were desperate for children by the</v>

496
00:29:25.821 --> 00:29:30.821
<v Speaker 1>time you were 30 and that kicks in about</v>
<v Speaker 1>28 and so expect it because it's going</v>

497
00:29:31.431 --> 00:29:33.210
<v Speaker 1>to happen and you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

498
00:29:33.211 --> 00:29:35.420
<v Speaker 1>I know it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to happen to me.</v>

499
00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:37.700
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can take that if you want,</v>

500
00:29:37.701 --> 00:29:40.420
<v Speaker 1>but I'm basically what I'm telling you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

501
00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:43.150
<v Speaker 1>my work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done a lot of work with really high</v>

502
00:29:43.151 --> 00:29:43.984
<v Speaker 1>achieving.</v>

503
00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:49.170
<v Speaker 1>Most of these were female partners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Senior partners is being offered and</v>

504
00:29:49.661 --> 00:29:51.790
<v Speaker 1>being a senior partner of a big law</v>
<v Speaker 1>firm.</v>

505
00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:56.290
<v Speaker 1>That's as hard as being a successful</v>
<v Speaker 1>clinical psychologist and you have to be</v>

506
00:29:56.291 --> 00:29:58.960
<v Speaker 1>at the top of your class as an</v>
<v Speaker 1>undergraduate.</v>

507
00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:02.710
<v Speaker 1>Then you have to get into a really good</v>
<v Speaker 1>law school and you have to be really</v>

508
00:30:02.711 --> 00:30:06.190
<v Speaker 1>good at that law school and you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go off an article and you have to be</v>

509
00:30:06.191 --> 00:30:10.570
<v Speaker 1>kept as an article in student and</v>
<v Speaker 1>generally you're not because the loss</v>

510
00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:12.460
<v Speaker 1>big law firms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

511
00:30:12.461 --> 00:30:15.130
<v Speaker 1>pulling Arctic new students,</v>
<v Speaker 1>working with deaf and throw away all the</v>

512
00:30:15.131 --> 00:30:18.490
<v Speaker 1>ones that don't make it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you make it well then you get to the</v>

513
00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:22.450
<v Speaker 1>associate and then they'll get it to</v>
<v Speaker 1>bolster those two and then if you're</v>

514
00:30:22.451 --> 00:30:25.630
<v Speaker 1>really good at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll be a senior partner and so that's</v>

515
00:30:25.631 --> 00:30:28.300
<v Speaker 1>tough and mode and make your email and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've done that.</v>

516
00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:30.220
<v Speaker 1>Your blood will committed to your</v>
<v Speaker 1>career.</v>

517
00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:35.340
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the time you hit 28 to 30 and you're</v>

518
00:30:35.441 --> 00:30:37.360
<v Speaker 1>working 70 hours a week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be thinking,</v>

519
00:30:37.361 --> 00:30:41.050
<v Speaker 1>what the hell am I working?</v>
<v Speaker 1>70 hours a week four which is reviewed</v>

520
00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:43.280
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good question and you're,</v>

521
00:30:43.281 --> 00:30:47.170
<v Speaker 1>your attention is going to turn happy</v>
<v Speaker 1>children as it should and the way you</v>

522
00:30:47.171 --> 00:30:49.780
<v Speaker 1>solve that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a female and you want a career</v>

523
00:30:49.781 --> 00:30:52.870
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a partner who's got clue and</v>

524
00:30:52.871 --> 00:30:56.740
<v Speaker 1>can provide some support and be you</v>
<v Speaker 1>outsource most of your domestic,</v>

525
00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:59.930
<v Speaker 1>most of the domestic responsibilities</v>
<v Speaker 1>that go along with the household.</v>

526
00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:01.150
<v Speaker 1>Yap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yap Anatomy.</v>

527
00:31:01.450 --> 00:31:04.190
<v Speaker 1>Maybe have to have a cook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't do any housework.</v>

528
00:31:04.191 --> 00:31:07.300
<v Speaker 1>She pay attention to your kids with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit of time that you have and</v>

529
00:31:07.301 --> 00:31:09.670
<v Speaker 1>that would work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Daycare care doesn't work.</v>

530
00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:13.510
<v Speaker 1>You're bloody law firm isn't going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take care of your children that are not</v>

531
00:31:13.511 --> 00:31:15.060
<v Speaker 1>going to set up the paid care in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>firm.</v>

532
00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:17.620
<v Speaker 1>That does work anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a nanny will work.</v>

533
00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:21.250
<v Speaker 1>And so you might as well be thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>things along that line because if you</v>

534
00:31:21.251 --> 00:31:24.270
<v Speaker 1>want to have a career and you're smart</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're hardworking and you showed</v>

535
00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:26.750
<v Speaker 1>how the career as you want to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>children,</v>

536
00:31:26.751 --> 00:31:30.670
<v Speaker 1>then you have to set your life so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do those two difficult things</v>

537
00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:35.110
<v Speaker 1>without dragging yourself stark raving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mad or exhausting yourself or destroying</v>

538
00:31:35.111 --> 00:31:37.750
<v Speaker 1>your relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's about the only way that I've</v>

539
00:31:37.751 --> 00:31:40.210
<v Speaker 1>seen so far that it's possible to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

540
00:31:40.610 --> 00:31:45.160
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so anyone's back to the back to career.</v>

541
00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:47.220
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now we've already established that</v>

542
00:31:47.221 --> 00:31:50.830
<v Speaker 1>what you're after is worth a lot and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to get and it's hard to get</v>

543
00:31:50.831 --> 00:31:53.170
<v Speaker 1>cause it's worth a lot and there's lots</v>
<v Speaker 1>of people chasing it.</v>

544
00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:56.410
<v Speaker 1>Now the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what can you do to give yourself an</v>

545
00:31:56.411 --> 00:31:57.244
<v Speaker 1>edge?</v>

546
00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:59.200
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

547
00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:04.260
<v Speaker 1>what makes skew good perception from a</v>
<v Speaker 1>career perspective?</v>

548
00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:06.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one is I you,</v>

549
00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:09.460
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're pretty much stuck with what</v>

550
00:32:09.461 --> 00:32:12.870
<v Speaker 1>you've got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can maintain it by exercising.</v>

551
00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:17.250
<v Speaker 1>It turns out physical exercise is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>best way you maintain your and thousands</v>

552
00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:19.690
<v Speaker 1>across time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It starts to plummet pretty</v>

553
00:32:19.691 --> 00:32:24.691
<v Speaker 1>precipitously after your voting did 24</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's downhill the 70 and then we'll</v>

554
00:32:24.970 --> 00:32:26.650
<v Speaker 1>after that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things get worse.</v>

555
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.960
<v Speaker 1>So you keep yourself in good physical</v>
<v Speaker 1>condition that's going to make a big</v>

556
00:32:31.961 --> 00:32:34.420
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would also say if you want to play a</v>

557
00:32:34.421 --> 00:32:37.030
<v Speaker 1>sharp gauge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you're going to be on the edge of</v>

558
00:32:37.031 --> 00:32:40.990
<v Speaker 1>things competing with people who are in</v>
<v Speaker 1>say in the top 1% top,</v>

559
00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:44.880
<v Speaker 1>you better get your drug and alcohol and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you send control because that compromise</v>

560
00:32:44.890 --> 00:32:46.520
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You better make sure that you're</v>

561
00:32:46.521 --> 00:32:50.600
<v Speaker 1>sleeping as well regulated and you'd</v>
<v Speaker 1>better make sure that you eat proper.</v>

562
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:53.750
<v Speaker 1>And those are there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not small and it's their big</v>

563
00:32:53.751 --> 00:32:57.830
<v Speaker 1>things cause you do the mammary day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say you can start to look</v>

564
00:32:57.831 --> 00:33:00.410
<v Speaker 1>at yourself now get up at the same time</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyday.</v>

565
00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:04.160
<v Speaker 1>Start learning how to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say get up to eight or seven 30</v>

566
00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:09.370
<v Speaker 1>because that's when civilized people get</v>
<v Speaker 1>up and the people you're competing with</v>

567
00:33:09.571 --> 00:33:10.404
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're really good.</v>

568
00:33:11.050 --> 00:33:14.930
<v Speaker 1>They're all already up at six and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're working by seven and they'll</v>

569
00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:18.870
<v Speaker 1>work you right into the ground because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people who are at the top and their</v>

570
00:33:18.871 --> 00:33:21.060
<v Speaker 1>discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's basically what you're talking</v>

571
00:33:21.061 --> 00:33:22.710
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're talking about doing something</v>

572
00:33:23.010 --> 00:33:26.430
<v Speaker 1>that requires phd level education as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>career,</v>

573
00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:28.620
<v Speaker 1>they're not popping around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

574
00:33:28.621 --> 00:33:31.780
<v Speaker 1>So here's the question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about this for a minute.</v>

575
00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:36.290
<v Speaker 1>So think about your typical day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now think about this.</v>

576
00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:40.490
<v Speaker 1>How much time do you waste?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you've been defined based any way</v>

577
00:33:40.491 --> 00:33:44.420
<v Speaker 1>you want the weight to define it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I would say time is wasted.</v>

578
00:33:44.421 --> 00:33:48.690
<v Speaker 1>When is that what you plan to keep you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

579
00:33:48.790 --> 00:33:50.620
<v Speaker 1>You know what it feels like to waste</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

580
00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:52.630
<v Speaker 1>You feel like a moron,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

581
00:33:52.810 --> 00:33:55.000
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know it was a feeling that</v>

582
00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:58.330
<v Speaker 1>really for me it's like a feeling like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that needs to take a shower.</v>

583
00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:02.140
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I deviated from the appropriate path.</v>

584
00:34:02.141 --> 00:34:02.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

585
00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:03.940
<v Speaker 1>Youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hail,</v>

586
00:34:03.941 --> 00:34:07.030
<v Speaker 1>some [inaudible].</v>

587
00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:08.740
<v Speaker 1>That's not the good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

588
00:34:08.741 --> 00:34:11.380
<v Speaker 1>so now you thought about that typical</v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

589
00:34:11.410 --> 00:34:13.270
<v Speaker 1>How much time do you waste?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

590
00:34:13.271 --> 00:34:14.990
<v Speaker 1>so let's find out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

591
00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:19.740
<v Speaker 1>how many people waste more than half an</v>
<v Speaker 1>hour?</v>

592
00:34:21.010 --> 00:34:21.843
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

593
00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:26.230
<v Speaker 1>Is there anybody here who thinks they</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't waste half an hour?</v>

594
00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:29.700
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you do take that,</v>

00:34:29.790 --> 00:34:31.420
<v Speaker 1>please do tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause you know,</v>

596
00:34:31.421 --> 00:34:34.450
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're efficient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people learn to be efficient.</v>

597
00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:35.381
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many ways?</v>

598
00:34:35.381 --> 00:34:38.160
<v Speaker 1>Two O's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

599
00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:40.450
<v Speaker 1>How bout,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how bout three?</v>

600
00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:43.060
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many think they waste less than</v>

601
00:34:43.061 --> 00:34:44.680
<v Speaker 1>three hours?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

602
00:34:45.430 --> 00:34:46.660
<v Speaker 1>One person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

603
00:34:46.661 --> 00:34:51.010
<v Speaker 1>I'll come back to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Four hours.</v>

604
00:34:52.810 --> 00:34:55.030
<v Speaker 1>Five hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

605
00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:59.390
<v Speaker 1>you better wake up people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say five hours.</v>

606
00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:00.880
<v Speaker 1>I won't embarrass you further.</v>

607
00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:05.553
<v Speaker 3>What's your time?</v>

608
00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:10.010
<v Speaker 1>No Matt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's come on.</v>

609
00:35:10.011 --> 00:35:12.800
<v Speaker 1>Let's make him money that's told to use</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

610
00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:14.450
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to evaluate.</v>

611
00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:17.150
<v Speaker 1>Value</v>
<v Speaker 1>your time.</v>

612
00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:21.860
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is that wrong?</v>

613
00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:24.890
<v Speaker 1>That's minimum wage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

614
00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:26.020
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

615
00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:28.040
<v Speaker 1>We're going to have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to play a capitalist here.</v>

616
00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:31.130
<v Speaker 1>It's normally valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to pay you again for the</v>

617
00:35:31.131 --> 00:35:33.010
<v Speaker 1>amount of money to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

618
00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:33.860
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're just,</v>

619
00:35:33.861 --> 00:35:38.861
<v Speaker 1>we're just talking about economic belt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all she has to be quantified.</v>

620
00:35:39.310 --> 00:35:40.750
<v Speaker 1>We're going to quantify,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

621
00:35:40.870 --> 00:35:42.690
<v Speaker 1>It's not tended the port.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

622
00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:47.400
<v Speaker 1>Because he have a future Janet quarters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you're worth.</v>

623
00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:50.370
<v Speaker 1>If you're tired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if what you do,</v>

624
00:35:50.371 --> 00:35:52.980
<v Speaker 1>how is it contributing to who you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be in the future.</v>

625
00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:55.300
<v Speaker 1>So it's more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much is,</v>

626
00:35:58.140 --> 00:35:58.591
<v Speaker 1>okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

627
00:35:58.591 --> 00:36:01.530
<v Speaker 1>let's look into this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you managed your career goals</v>

628
00:36:01.531 --> 00:36:04.570
<v Speaker 1>in his head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feeling then you're making the</v>

629
00:36:04.571 --> 00:36:06.880
<v Speaker 1>amount of money you should be paying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we've got a whole,</v>

630
00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:10.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm here a lot back in the seventy five</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand seventy five thousand dollars a</v>

631
00:36:10.371 --> 00:36:14.690
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's about $6,000 a month or about</v>

632
00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:17.980
<v Speaker 1>1500 bucks a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we'll assume 40 hours,</v>

633
00:36:18.350 --> 00:36:20.860
<v Speaker 1>that's about $45 an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

634
00:36:20.861 --> 00:36:23.560
<v Speaker 1>let's assume that you're worth 35 you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>

635
00:36:23.590 --> 00:36:24.980
<v Speaker 1>if you're slow Haiti,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

636
00:36:24.990 --> 00:36:26.620
<v Speaker 1>you're not worth that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

637
00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:30.700
<v Speaker 1>but the time that you spend it now isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>invested,</v>

638
00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:32.400
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even though you might not be,</v>

639
00:36:32.401 --> 00:36:35.880
<v Speaker 1>he paid for it this second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your banking one in sports.</v>

640
00:36:35.890 --> 00:36:39.760
<v Speaker 1>So we paid for later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can't be fake and it's 10 bucks.</v>

641
00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:42.760
<v Speaker 1>So we'll say we'll say 40 because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes the math easier.</v>

642
00:36:42.761 --> 00:36:47.180
<v Speaker 1>So how much time you're wasting a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five hours fast switch partners for it.</v>

643
00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:52.680
<v Speaker 1>200 times 5,000 multiply it by seven</v>
<v Speaker 1>because after all,</v>

644
00:36:53.911 --> 00:36:57.220
<v Speaker 1>we're wasting time on the weekends too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's 1400 week.</v>

645
00:36:57.250 --> 00:37:00.130
<v Speaker 1>How many weeks in a month?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Four.</v>

646
00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:01.690
<v Speaker 1>What's four times 1400</v>

647
00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:03.533
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

648
00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:07.760
<v Speaker 1>5,600 so we'll say hi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this same argument,</v>

649
00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:10.910
<v Speaker 1>5,000 a month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many months in a year</v>

650
00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:17.310
<v Speaker 1>you're wasting $60,000 a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

651
00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:23.060
<v Speaker 1>So maybe you should stop doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>$60,000</v>

652
00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:27.480
<v Speaker 1>and there are people that people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they give me competing with,</v>

653
00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:30.710
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be wasting my time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe you're going to be wasting</v>

654
00:37:30.711 --> 00:37:35.120
<v Speaker 1>$30,000 or 15,000 of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're wasting five hours a day,</v>

655
00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:37.790
<v Speaker 1>you better get your act together because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to pay for that.</v>

656
00:37:37.791 --> 00:37:40.160
<v Speaker 1>And the way is that foolish waste of</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

657
00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:42.980
<v Speaker 1>Now Iq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there isn't much you can do about it.</v>

658
00:37:42.981 --> 00:37:47.210
<v Speaker 1>We already said that you could actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>saw us and maybe you can read and you</v>

659
00:37:47.211 --> 00:37:50.900
<v Speaker 1>can read it as broadly as you possibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>can until you should read every day.</v>

660
00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:55.010
<v Speaker 1>That would be helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe you should read nonfiction,</v>

661
00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:56.780
<v Speaker 1>especially if you want to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientist,</v>

662
00:37:57.370 --> 00:38:00.260
<v Speaker 1>what maybe he couldn't work on to work</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard.</v>

663
00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:04.520
<v Speaker 1>And one rule of thumb to that is how</v>
<v Speaker 1>much time you waste.</v>

664
00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:07.620
<v Speaker 1>Now you can do a little more in depth</v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis and when you speak down,</v>

665
00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:09.950
<v Speaker 1>because I could also ask him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I assume he said,</v>

666
00:38:09.951 --> 00:38:13.680
<v Speaker 1>come and see me and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what else do you do it or you want the</v>

667
00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:14.560
<v Speaker 1>Scorps?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we said,</v>

668
00:38:14.570 --> 00:38:17.090
<v Speaker 1>well how much are you working on it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>

669
00:38:17.091 --> 00:38:19.160
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew ivory six times today.</v>

670
00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:24.900
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's what I asked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I asked how much time you're spending</v>

671
00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:29.250
<v Speaker 1>working on because first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should be in the library for six</v>

672
00:38:29.251 --> 00:38:31.320
<v Speaker 1>times a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just insane.</v>

673
00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:36.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anyone at all except for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>very small fraction of people who are</v>

674
00:38:36.281 --> 00:38:39.310
<v Speaker 1>extremely disciplined,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well put together who could concentrate</v>

675
00:38:39.311 --> 00:38:42.220
<v Speaker 1>on difficult material for six hours in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>row.</v>

676
00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:45.700
<v Speaker 1>You're lucky if you can manage three</v>
<v Speaker 1>like real work.</v>

677
00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.820
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing you do is half of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your time in the library and naming and</v>

678
00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:51.400
<v Speaker 1>double your discipline.</v>

679
00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:55.630
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's say we could look at a typical</v>

680
00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:57.010
<v Speaker 1>hour that you're working and I might</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

681
00:38:57.011 --> 00:38:59.290
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how hard are you working during that</v>

682
00:38:59.290 --> 00:39:01.260
<v Speaker 1>hour?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You how hard you be working if someone</v>

683
00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:02.650
<v Speaker 1>pulled it out with a gun and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

684
00:39:02.651 --> 00:39:05.100
<v Speaker 1>if you don't work as hard as you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>connect to around under to shoot,</v>

685
00:39:05.770 --> 00:39:06.730
<v Speaker 1>and then you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

686
00:39:06.731 --> 00:39:10.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking about one 10th as hard</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I can [inaudible] actually that's a</v>

687
00:39:10.851 --> 00:39:11.684
<v Speaker 1>moat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

688
00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:14.950
<v Speaker 1>I bet you that's about right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason I use that fingers,</v>

689
00:39:14.951 --> 00:39:19.480
<v Speaker 1>because I figured out a long time ago</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you have a given task to do and</v>

690
00:39:19.481 --> 00:39:22.050
<v Speaker 1>you sit for five or 10 minutes and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think Coppin,</v>

691
00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:23.740
<v Speaker 1>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this headline is faster.</v>

692
00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:27.500
<v Speaker 1>You can almost always figuring out how</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do it 10 times faster and some kind</v>

693
00:39:27.501 --> 00:39:31.810
<v Speaker 1>of better and can kind of staff strep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's also something to really know</v>

694
00:39:31.811 --> 00:39:35.800
<v Speaker 1>because what you'll find as you mature</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your career is that you'll be asked</v>

695
00:39:35.801 --> 00:39:38.230
<v Speaker 1>to do way more than is humanly possible.</v>

696
00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:41.440
<v Speaker 1>And the way that you learn how to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is you get way faster than you</v>

697
00:39:41.441 --> 00:39:44.680
<v Speaker 1>think you could be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And just using the 10 items,</v>

698
00:39:45.170 --> 00:39:47.260
<v Speaker 1>Margaret Little fountains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an excellent one,</v>

699
00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:50.050
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's remarkable how much you can do in a</v>

700
00:39:50.051 --> 00:39:54.220
<v Speaker 1>very short period of time if you set</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself up with that expectation.</v>

701
00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:57.180
<v Speaker 1>So then when you remember what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking is worthwhile,</v>

702
00:39:57.240 --> 00:40:00.360
<v Speaker 1>then you might think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>$40 it's an underestimated your time to</v>

703
00:40:00.361 --> 00:40:01.780
<v Speaker 1>actually work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them has to be physical.</v>

704
00:40:02.650 --> 00:40:03.850
<v Speaker 1>You're young again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

705
00:40:05.770 --> 00:40:08.140
<v Speaker 1>every hour that you have now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you shape yourself,</v>

706
00:40:08.141 --> 00:40:10.120
<v Speaker 1>pays off through the old course of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

707
00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:13.960
<v Speaker 1>You know a lot of what I do now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't a did when I was 20 but what</v>

708
00:40:13.961 --> 00:40:17.110
<v Speaker 1>you do now that you're 23 has been</v>
<v Speaker 1>effecting when you're my age.</v>

709
00:40:17.111 --> 00:40:20.730
<v Speaker 1>So your time is actually worth more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though you can't get any better,</v>

710
00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:22.210
<v Speaker 1>can pay for [inaudible].</v>

711
00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:27.430
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so those might rethink what learning to</v>

712
00:40:27.431 --> 00:40:30.160
<v Speaker 1>do is to figure out how to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>efficient.</v>

713
00:40:30.370 --> 00:40:35.110
<v Speaker 1>And you've got to be ruthless with</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself to be efficient and then to be</v>

714
00:40:35.111 --> 00:40:37.180
<v Speaker 1>efficient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you were going to pursue a</v>

715
00:40:37.181 --> 00:40:40.570
<v Speaker 1>career efficient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people win and they don't just wait a</v>

716
00:40:40.571 --> 00:40:41.920
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

717
00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:43.900
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys have probably learned that most</v>

718
00:40:43.901 --> 00:40:46.090
<v Speaker 1>things in life are normally distributed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right</v>

719
00:40:50.290 --> 00:40:51.101
<v Speaker 1>height.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

720
00:40:51.101 --> 00:40:53.800
<v Speaker 1>you should have learned that if you're a</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology student and you haven't</v>

721
00:40:53.801 --> 00:40:55.420
<v Speaker 1>learned that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's really something wrong</v>

722
00:40:55.450 --> 00:40:59.830
<v Speaker 1>because that's like the basic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the basic premise of statistics.</v>

723
00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:03.190
<v Speaker 1>So of most statistics anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so all right,</v>

724
00:41:03.191 --> 00:41:06.100
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe the average span is five for 10</v>

725
00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:09.700
<v Speaker 1>and then there's a standard deviation</v>
<v Speaker 1>around that.</v>

726
00:41:09.701 --> 00:41:12.280
<v Speaker 1>If maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it's probably something like six</v>

727
00:41:12.281 --> 00:41:17.281
<v Speaker 1>inches and then 85% of men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>60 60%,</v>

728
00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:22.210
<v Speaker 1>65% of men fall in that range.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

729
00:41:22.211 --> 00:41:24.630
<v Speaker 1>So and heights like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weights like that.</v>

730
00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:29.640
<v Speaker 1>When intelligence is like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most things are distributed according to</v>

731
00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:32.650
<v Speaker 1>the normal distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but lifeboat comes,</v>

732
00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:36.620
<v Speaker 1>they're distributed according to a frito</v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution</v>

733
00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:42.650
<v Speaker 1>and that's a free of distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

734
00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:45.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody know how much money Bill Gates</v>

735
00:41:45.321 --> 00:41:46.154
<v Speaker 1>House</v>

736
00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:48.533
<v Speaker 2>about</v>

737
00:41:49.210 --> 00:41:53.130
<v Speaker 1>or you don't get me out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how much money did the top 10 richest</v>

738
00:41:53.131 --> 00:41:56.520
<v Speaker 1>man in the last half,</v>
<v Speaker 1>300 billion,</v>

739
00:41:57.180 --> 00:41:59.880
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a thousand gallons for every</v>

740
00:41:59.881 --> 00:42:03.330
<v Speaker 1>single person in the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is more than the average family</v>

741
00:42:03.331 --> 00:42:06.450
<v Speaker 1>hasn't savings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the top 40 men in the United States</v>

742
00:42:06.451 --> 00:42:10.190
<v Speaker 1>have more money than all the rest of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans have put together and saying</v>

743
00:42:10.191 --> 00:42:12.930
<v Speaker 1>it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the talk hundred richest man in the</v>

744
00:42:12.931 --> 00:42:14.900
<v Speaker 1>world have more money than the bar and</v>
<v Speaker 1>she would believe it,</v>

745
00:42:16.410 --> 00:42:19.290
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is a great distribution.</v>

746
00:42:19.590 --> 00:42:21.690
<v Speaker 1>It see the same thing with creative</v>
<v Speaker 1>production.</v>

747
00:42:21.691 --> 00:42:26.691
<v Speaker 1>So let's say you're looking at Ph d</v>
<v Speaker 1>students and you want to know how many</v>

748
00:42:27.151 --> 00:42:29.430
<v Speaker 1>publications they have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

749
00:42:29.431 --> 00:42:30.960
<v Speaker 1>the media now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is one.</v>

750
00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:35.390
<v Speaker 1>The medium is the number that most</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have for.</v>

751
00:42:35.410 --> 00:42:38.940
<v Speaker 1>It's not the means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's if you cough up for typical phd</v>

752
00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:41.460
<v Speaker 1>student,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do I have to call her and said</v>

753
00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:44.760
<v Speaker 1>publications can say one.</v>

754
00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:50.390
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well if you're not retired one cause one</v>

755
00:42:50.410 --> 00:42:52.650
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it doesn't count.</v>

756
00:42:52.890 --> 00:42:56.520
<v Speaker 1>It's more than a zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's only one more than zero.</v>

757
00:42:57.030 --> 00:43:01.560
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then there's going to be the top 1%</v>

758
00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:07.160
<v Speaker 1>of the students way the hell over here</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're going to have 22% of the</v>

759
00:43:08.061 --> 00:43:11.340
<v Speaker 1>time they graduate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is about as many as been typical</v>

760
00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:16.350
<v Speaker 1>associate professor has that tenure and</v>
<v Speaker 1>north of the people you'll be competing</v>

761
00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:20.580
<v Speaker 1>on the job market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they published the be in their phd</v>

762
00:43:20.581 --> 00:43:24.180
<v Speaker 1>for five years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll publish more papers a year and</v>

763
00:43:24.181 --> 00:43:28.770
<v Speaker 1>have promote and there'll be higher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so just for the sake of comparison,</v>

764
00:43:29.370 --> 00:43:33.070
<v Speaker 1>the typical professor at a top rate</v>
<v Speaker 1>research institution,</v>

765
00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:37.110
<v Speaker 1>according to North America polishes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could be three to four papers a year.</v>

766
00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:42.030
<v Speaker 1>So the graduate students that are hot</v>
<v Speaker 1>prospects on the job market,</v>

767
00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:45.060
<v Speaker 1>and that makes it likely that you'll get</v>
<v Speaker 1>an academic job,</v>

768
00:43:45.061 --> 00:43:50.061
<v Speaker 1>although not certain are oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>producing technical associate and</v>

769
00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:54.560
<v Speaker 1>assistant professors at universities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's hardly any of these people</v>

770
00:43:54.561 --> 00:43:58.200
<v Speaker 1>and all of the science is done by these</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

771
00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:02.600
<v Speaker 1>sort of the rest of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just wanting to be,</v>

772
00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:06.850
<v Speaker 1>so all the people who aren't waiting on</v>
<v Speaker 1>at that tail end,</v>

773
00:44:07.110 --> 00:44:10.040
<v Speaker 1>they're just keeping the institutions</v>
<v Speaker 1>running.</v>

774
00:44:11.070 --> 00:44:15.990
<v Speaker 1>So what's the typical profit margin for</v>
<v Speaker 1>a typical corporation year after year?</v>

775
00:44:17.350 --> 00:44:18.183
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>

776
00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:25.180
<v Speaker 1>Well guess how much money do you get?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much interest do you get when you</v>

777
00:44:25.181 --> 00:44:28.590
<v Speaker 1>put your money in the bay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matt?</v>

778
00:44:29.550 --> 00:44:31.540
<v Speaker 1>Do percentage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

779
00:44:31.590 --> 00:44:35.340
<v Speaker 1>so obviously you've talked to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened even with the 2% and no</v>

780
00:44:35.341 --> 00:44:36.490
<v Speaker 1>one would ever destined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

781
00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:39.840
<v Speaker 1>so it's gotta to be more than 2% okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's around five,</v>

782
00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:42.300
<v Speaker 1>5%.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm really efficient.</v>

783
00:44:42.301 --> 00:44:46.130
<v Speaker 1>Company runs on a 5% margin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means it's been,</v>

784
00:44:46.131 --> 00:44:51.131
<v Speaker 1>is 95% of its fine just exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything is that we'll stay stand</v>

785
00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:56.580
<v Speaker 1>mobile phones just existed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of the power comes into how many of</v>

786
00:44:58.270 --> 00:44:59.760
<v Speaker 1>you put yourself in the coffin?</v>

787
00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:04.780
<v Speaker 2>I'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>let you guys sweat and go here.</v>

788
00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:49.080
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you want to put yourself up at</v>

789
00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:50.710
<v Speaker 1>this end of the distribution,</v>

790
00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:00.320
<v Speaker 2>you do it</v>

791
00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:03.110
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can give you an example.</v>

792
00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:04.850
<v Speaker 1>Differences in people's could.</v>

793
00:46:07.310 --> 00:46:08.143
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>

794
00:46:10.450 --> 00:46:15.450
<v Speaker 1>Are you 65,000 pieces as far three 65</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

795
00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:18.800
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the median number of pieces,</v>

796
00:46:18.801 --> 00:46:21.790
<v Speaker 1>parts for people produces zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

797
00:46:21.791 --> 00:46:23.890
<v Speaker 1>So that's a huge difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But almost all of them.</v>

798
00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:25.580
<v Speaker 1>Fields of creative production.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

799
00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:29.060
<v Speaker 1>almost everyone does nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a few people do.</v>

800
00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:31.840
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

801
00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:35.040
<v Speaker 1>Bach Js,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bach,</v>

802
00:46:35.041 --> 00:46:38.970
<v Speaker 1>he wrote so much music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you took all smeared districts and</v>

803
00:46:38.971 --> 00:46:43.971
<v Speaker 1>you just copied the</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 years and he was actually writing the</v>

804
00:46:45.241 --> 00:46:48.470
<v Speaker 1>music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just popping up so people can get</v>

805
00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:53.540
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably productive and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the ones who have to stomach</v>

806
00:46:55.550 --> 00:46:57.030
<v Speaker 1>premiers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

807
00:46:57.060 --> 00:47:02.060
<v Speaker 1>so what do you need to do that wow</v>
<v Speaker 1>can do much about your intelligence,</v>

808
00:47:02.571 --> 00:47:05.490
<v Speaker 1>but we can learn the word and work</v>
<v Speaker 1>matters.</v>

809
00:47:05.491 --> 00:47:09.630
<v Speaker 1>Conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a trade is a big predictor of</v>

810
00:47:09.631 --> 00:47:12.640
<v Speaker 1>longterm life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Success and conscientious people are</v>

811
00:47:12.670 --> 00:47:14.880
<v Speaker 1>ordering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which isn't quite as relevant and</v>

812
00:47:14.881 --> 00:47:17.340
<v Speaker 1>industrious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>industrious people.</v>

813
00:47:17.730 --> 00:47:19.800
<v Speaker 1>When they put their mind to something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do it.</v>

814
00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:23.820
<v Speaker 1>There's no wasting time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the people I know who were really</v>

815
00:47:23.821 --> 00:47:28.110
<v Speaker 1>successful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so they were up in the top one 10th</v>

816
00:47:28.111 --> 00:47:32.500
<v Speaker 1>of 1% which is only 1000 break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you guys are already,</v>

817
00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:36.700
<v Speaker 1>he's probably one in a hundred if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at your Iq and your work ethic.</v>

818
00:47:37.390 --> 00:47:41.590
<v Speaker 1>So one in 10 of you is one in a thousand</v>
<v Speaker 1>or so.</v>

819
00:47:42.730 --> 00:47:45.310
<v Speaker 1>People like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't waste any time.</v>

820
00:47:46.210 --> 00:47:50.020
<v Speaker 1>And I really mean that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they five minutes be productive,</v>

821
00:47:50.021 --> 00:47:51.970
<v Speaker 1>we'll be more than five minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And most people do that.</v>

822
00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:56.020
<v Speaker 1>And that's not an exaggeration because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've learned to be bloody</v>

823
00:47:56.021 --> 00:47:57.940
<v Speaker 1>efficiently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do not waste time.</v>

824
00:47:58.330 --> 00:48:00.840
<v Speaker 1>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can I do things too fast?</v>

825
00:48:00.860 --> 00:48:02.860
<v Speaker 1>And they think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can I do this one thing.</v>

826
00:48:02.861 --> 00:48:05.350
<v Speaker 1>So it does five things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>similar pace.</v>

827
00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:08.620
<v Speaker 1>And also I kill five birds with one</v>
<v Speaker 1>stone instead of two.</v>

828
00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:13.900
<v Speaker 1>And that way they maximal use of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>current and they disciplined themselves</v>

829
00:48:13.901 --> 00:48:18.120
<v Speaker 1>and also the big rock in a cost of</v>
<v Speaker 1>battle with themselves about doing what</v>

830
00:48:18.130 --> 00:48:18.963
<v Speaker 1>they should be doing.</v>

831
00:48:19.210 --> 00:48:23.260
<v Speaker 1>They just bloody well do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why they can produce,</v>

832
00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:27.760
<v Speaker 1>they can produce at these levels reading</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost beyond human imagination.</v>

833
00:48:28.990 --> 00:48:33.640
<v Speaker 1>So discipline really matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're wasting time and you want</v>

834
00:48:33.641 --> 00:48:35.380
<v Speaker 1>to pursue a different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most career,</v>

835
00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:37.810
<v Speaker 1>better learn how to get that under</v>
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>

836
00:48:38.110 --> 00:48:40.630
<v Speaker 1>The best way to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as I can tell us,</v>

837
00:48:40.631 --> 00:48:43.090
<v Speaker 1>can pick something that's difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that,</v>

838
00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:44.470
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you'd like to do.</v>

839
00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:47.950
<v Speaker 1>It's difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something that's kind of beyond you and</v>

840
00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:50.190
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bang your head against him will probably</v>

841
00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:54.130
<v Speaker 1>that a couple of years of like really</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard work to mold yourself into</v>

842
00:48:54.131 --> 00:48:57.730
<v Speaker 1>something that is utterly useless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a,</v>

843
00:48:57.790 --> 00:49:01.540
<v Speaker 1>there's a big payoff associated with</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and I think that's something you</v>

844
00:49:01.541 --> 00:49:06.541
<v Speaker 1>can do merely by warrantying it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>attending to and that if you do that</v>

845
00:49:09.550 --> 00:49:10.540
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

846
00:49:11.180 --> 00:49:13.180
<v Speaker 1>you get disciplined and that's really</v>
<v Speaker 1>useful.</v>

847
00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:16.300
<v Speaker 1>It's why it doesn't matter so much what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you studied when you first go to</v>

848
00:49:16.301 --> 00:49:18.500
<v Speaker 1>graduate school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What really matters is that you started</v>

849
00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:23.520
<v Speaker 1>something and you really study at heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now when I went to graduate school,</v>

850
00:49:23.921 --> 00:49:26.560
<v Speaker 1>I went to Grad school and neal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had a great time.</v>

851
00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:31.830
<v Speaker 1>I had a great social life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We be spent a lot of time going into</v>

852
00:49:31.850 --> 00:49:35.440
<v Speaker 1>restaurants and going to bars and play</v>
<v Speaker 1>softball in a blacks.</v>

853
00:49:35.650 --> 00:49:37.690
<v Speaker 1>But all the people I went to graduate</v>
<v Speaker 1>school with,</v>

854
00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:41.290
<v Speaker 1>they worked like 10 hours a day and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>work like mad dogs.</v>

855
00:49:41.291 --> 00:49:43.210
<v Speaker 1>And so that was fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we're done their 10 hours,</v>

856
00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:44.560
<v Speaker 1>then they can go off and have fun with</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

857
00:49:44.561 --> 00:49:49.060
<v Speaker 1>There was no lock in about during the</v>
<v Speaker 1>work period and whether they were hung</v>

858
00:49:49.061 --> 00:49:51.160
<v Speaker 1>over or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go out and they enjoy their work.</v>

859
00:49:52.090 --> 00:49:56.620
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what you have learned to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do and it makes your life more enjoyable</v>

860
00:49:56.621 --> 00:49:57.970
<v Speaker 1>and entertaining,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not less.</v>

861
00:49:58.030 --> 00:49:59.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you really want to waste five hours a</v>

862
00:49:59.981 --> 00:50:02.050
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to 30 or wasting time.</v>

863
00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:06.220
<v Speaker 1>If you live 90 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wasted 30 years and if you waste 30</v>

864
00:50:06.221 --> 00:50:08.370
<v Speaker 1>years you'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you wonder why you are attending</v>

865
00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:13.390
<v Speaker 1>Edwards slash come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty easy to figure out if you</v>

866
00:50:13.481 --> 00:50:14.660
<v Speaker 1>always 30 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

867
00:50:15.460 --> 00:50:19.060
<v Speaker 1>And why should because you're just</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasting your time.</v>

868
00:50:19.540 --> 00:50:22.270
<v Speaker 1>So it's best to really learn how to stop</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing that.</v>

869
00:50:22.510 --> 00:50:25.140
<v Speaker 1>It'd be a terrible battle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially for those of you crossing,</v>

870
00:50:25.450 --> 00:50:27.040
<v Speaker 1>you lost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are like,</v>

871
00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:31.310
<v Speaker 1>you really have to rewire it yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>and get that under control.</v>

872
00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:37.270
<v Speaker 1>So if you want to be successful at a</v>
<v Speaker 1>high competition career and that's what</v>

873
00:50:37.521 --> 00:50:37.810
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

874
00:50:37.810 --> 00:50:38.643
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

875
00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:42.420
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to start from it and ask them</v>

876
00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:46.190
<v Speaker 1>questions and then I'll tell you a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit about what options you have.</v>

877
00:50:46.250 --> 00:50:48.110
<v Speaker 1>If you choose psychology psychology's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>career,</v>

878
00:50:48.111 --> 00:50:50.610
<v Speaker 1>what sort of things laying themselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>open to so,</v>

879
00:50:51.110 --> 00:50:53.330
<v Speaker 1>so if you have any questions,</v>

880
00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:59.760
<v Speaker 3>now's the time to as a pass from</v>
<v Speaker 3>extracurricular activities per se,</v>

881
00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:07.690
<v Speaker 3>something outside of the career will</v>
<v Speaker 3>help you get into Grad school there.</v>

882
00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:12.960
<v Speaker 1>No</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the Gres that slipped past.</v>

883
00:51:14.340 --> 00:51:19.340
<v Speaker 1>The rest of this law mean if you hit c.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing is it's a multiple threshold</v>

884
00:51:20.281 --> 00:51:22.650
<v Speaker 1>cutoff system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So first of all,</v>

885
00:51:22.651 --> 00:51:24.420
<v Speaker 1>you have to get aids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't,</v>

886
00:51:24.421 --> 00:51:26.420
<v Speaker 1>you're out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then if you have a's,</v>

887
00:51:26.421 --> 00:51:28.740
<v Speaker 1>you have to have certain gre lows and if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>

888
00:51:28.741 --> 00:51:32.910
<v Speaker 1>you're out give you have certain grades</v>
<v Speaker 1>and certain gre was Dan.</v>

889
00:51:32.911 --> 00:51:37.140
<v Speaker 1>You're in vantage random factors that</v>
<v Speaker 1>determine whether or not you're going to</v>

890
00:51:37.141 --> 00:51:40.440
<v Speaker 1>get shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is partly why you want to maximize</v>

891
00:51:40.441 --> 00:51:44.460
<v Speaker 1>your probability of success by applying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to many any place.</v>

892
00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:47.070
<v Speaker 1>Because let's say that you're a</v>
<v Speaker 1>threshold student.</v>

893
00:51:47.610 --> 00:51:49.410
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to look over your application.</v>

894
00:51:49.770 --> 00:51:51.690
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going to determine when the right</v>

895
00:51:51.700 --> 00:51:55.650
<v Speaker 1>data do I need us to eat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>

896
00:51:55.870 --> 00:52:00.080
<v Speaker 1>do you want to have to find it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have funding if you can get shirt</v>

897
00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:00.750
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

898
00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:02.370
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or um,</v>

899
00:52:02.940 --> 00:52:06.120
<v Speaker 1>MRC funding as a graduate student,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that helps a lot.</v>

900
00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:08.840
<v Speaker 1>And if you're above threshold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you sort of act two actual and then</v>

901
00:52:08.841 --> 00:52:10.950
<v Speaker 1>you got funding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really easy for a professor and</v>

902
00:52:10.951 --> 00:52:12.020
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

903
00:52:12.060 --> 00:52:16.260
<v Speaker 1>you're not gonna eat up granite</v>
<v Speaker 1>resources.</v>

904
00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:20.800
<v Speaker 1>So that's really helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can apply for Grad school,</v>

905
00:52:21.900 --> 00:52:24.510
<v Speaker 1>you have to still have the same level of</v>
<v Speaker 1>attainment.</v>

906
00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:27.940
<v Speaker 1>Some extra curricular activities can</v>
<v Speaker 1>help with that you have or don't have</v>

907
00:52:27.941 --> 00:52:32.941
<v Speaker 1>experience and you can write at a decent</v>
<v Speaker 1>research proposal that increase the</v>

908
00:52:33.211 --> 00:52:35.000
<v Speaker 1>probability that you can get a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fellowship.</v>

909
00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:40.090
<v Speaker 1>So laboratory experience and upstairs</v>
<v Speaker 1>lobby sterns also helps when you get to</v>

910
00:52:40.091 --> 00:52:41.790
<v Speaker 1>Grad School,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause you know what the hell is her</v>

911
00:52:41.791 --> 00:52:43.340
<v Speaker 1>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get a jump on it,</v>

912
00:52:44.030 --> 00:52:46.190
<v Speaker 1>but as long as you help them get in</v>
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

913
00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:51.360
<v Speaker 1>If I'm looking at two students who</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically cross threshold the say way</v>

914
00:52:51.450 --> 00:52:55.550
<v Speaker 1>and one of them has extra lab experience</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe know some computer program,</v>

915
00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:59.230
<v Speaker 1>you'd have some useful skills or it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>good statistically,</v>

916
00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:01.440
<v Speaker 1>well men are all certainly prefer that.</v>

917
00:53:01.590 --> 00:53:06.590
<v Speaker 1>But I won't even see the applications</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless those first two things are matt</v>

918
00:53:06.801 --> 00:53:09.450
<v Speaker 1>and I promptly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And not even deciding that.</v>

919
00:53:09.870 --> 00:53:13.290
<v Speaker 1>Because usually what happens when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>apply is said there's a committee of</v>

920
00:53:13.291 --> 00:53:17.310
<v Speaker 1>administrators that that was the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>pass and they don't even let you through</v>

921
00:53:17.311 --> 00:53:21.540
<v Speaker 1>the your application through the door to</v>
<v Speaker 1>see the professors unless you meet the</v>

922
00:53:21.541 --> 00:53:24.720
<v Speaker 1>minimum criteria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

923
00:53:24.721 --> 00:53:28.280
<v Speaker 1>students desperate to give the extra</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience that we get into graduate</v>

924
00:53:28.290 --> 00:53:32.220
<v Speaker 1>schools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a publication you couldn't help but</v>

925
00:53:32.221 --> 00:53:35.700
<v Speaker 1>they're hard to get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you do a like an honors research</v>

926
00:53:35.701 --> 00:53:37.140
<v Speaker 1>project for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it works,</v>

927
00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:40.590
<v Speaker 1>you can write it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but almost no one does that because by</v>

928
00:53:40.591 --> 00:53:43.260
<v Speaker 1>the time you're down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're down project and you've written</v>

929
00:53:43.261 --> 00:53:45.990
<v Speaker 1>up your thesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're only one 10th the way to having</v>

930
00:53:45.991 --> 00:53:48.720
<v Speaker 1>it published.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's something else to think about</v>

931
00:53:48.721 --> 00:53:50.340
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to be an academic cycle,</v>

932
00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:57.800
<v Speaker 1>everything ever do will be rejected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And not just the middle name,</v>

933
00:53:57.801 --> 00:54:01.040
<v Speaker 1>either your work for something once for</v>
<v Speaker 1>six months we'll write your first</v>

934
00:54:01.041 --> 00:54:05.840
<v Speaker 1>research paper and you set it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe not doing a very good journal and</v>

935
00:54:05.841 --> 00:54:07.880
<v Speaker 1>you'll get free reduced back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they'll say,</v>

936
00:54:08.450 --> 00:54:11.840
<v Speaker 1>this is the stupidest thing I've ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>seen and you might as well quit.</v>

937
00:54:12.370 --> 00:54:13.160
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

938
00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:16.670
<v Speaker 1>and you'll get those letters throughout</v>
<v Speaker 1>her whole career and you'll say,</v>

939
00:54:16.671 --> 00:54:19.960
<v Speaker 1>well this doesn't suck as much as it</v>
<v Speaker 1>could.</v>

940
00:54:19.970 --> 00:54:24.030
<v Speaker 1>So to really work hard on it and use</v>
<v Speaker 1>this part of yeah and he would dress</v>

941
00:54:24.031 --> 00:54:27.880
<v Speaker 1>these 30 concerns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we'll be willing to look at it</v>

942
00:54:27.890 --> 00:54:29.390
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But don't get your hopes up.</v>

943
00:54:29.570 --> 00:54:31.420
<v Speaker 1>And that's when you go have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

944
00:54:31.940 --> 00:54:35.540
<v Speaker 1>a pint at the local bar because that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best news you're going to hit this</v>

945
00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:38.060
<v Speaker 1>month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's another thing to think about</v>

946
00:54:38.061 --> 00:54:39.920
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're,</v>

947
00:54:39.921 --> 00:54:42.200
<v Speaker 1>when you're thinking about whether this</v>
<v Speaker 1>tourney careers for you,</v>

948
00:54:42.201 --> 00:54:44.600
<v Speaker 1>because if you're rather high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you needed the motion,</v>

949
00:54:46.190 --> 00:54:48.470
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get punched in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>stomach a lot.</v>

950
00:54:48.470 --> 00:54:51.460
<v Speaker 1>And you've got to ask yourself whether</v>
<v Speaker 1>or not you can learn to tolerate that.</v>

951
00:54:51.590 --> 00:54:53.620
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a function of the,</v>

952
00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:56.930
<v Speaker 1>of the business because it's hard to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>published,</v>

953
00:54:56.931 --> 00:54:58.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rejection rate to do the</v>

954
00:54:58.290 --> 00:55:02.900
<v Speaker 1>journalist's 95 to 99% which is worse</v>
<v Speaker 1>than your application.</v>

955
00:55:03.110 --> 00:55:05.080
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your chances of getting accepted to</v>

956
00:55:05.340 --> 00:55:07.670
<v Speaker 1>graduate school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just looking for reasons not to</v>

957
00:55:07.671 --> 00:55:09.800
<v Speaker 1>promise your damn paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it can be,</v>

958
00:55:09.801 --> 00:55:11.660
<v Speaker 1>because there's a mistaken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might give you guys,</v>

959
00:55:11.661 --> 00:55:13.480
<v Speaker 1>it's too good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want,</v>

960
00:55:13.510 --> 00:55:16.340
<v Speaker 1>and it scares people and there were</v>
<v Speaker 1>political reasons or whatever,</v>

961
00:55:16.341 --> 00:55:19.870
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of rejection and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true for most of,</v>

962
00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:22.610
<v Speaker 1>so you have to get used to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in academia,</v>

963
00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:25.970
<v Speaker 1>I think in some ways it's works because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're always trying to publish in.</v>

964
00:55:26.150 --> 00:55:28.850
<v Speaker 1>The answer is always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't want your stupid paper.</v>

965
00:55:28.851 --> 00:55:30.080
<v Speaker 1>We've got $100 ones.</v>

966
00:55:30.730 --> 00:55:35.730
<v Speaker 3>So I guess you could use</v>
<v Speaker 3>research and teaching,</v>

967
00:55:38.710 --> 00:55:41.380
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

968
00:55:43.590 --> 00:55:48.290
<v Speaker 3>want to widen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The psychologist might choose to work</v>

969
00:55:48.450 --> 00:55:50.430
<v Speaker 3>faster rather than full time.</v>

970
00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:52.073
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

971
00:55:53.050 --> 00:55:56.530
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so one of the answers to that is why you</v>

972
00:55:56.531 --> 00:55:58.810
<v Speaker 1>would ever want to be a professor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

973
00:55:58.811 --> 00:56:01.240
<v Speaker 1>So here's why you might want to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>professor.</v>

974
00:56:01.660 --> 00:56:06.160
<v Speaker 1>One of the things you might watch at</v>
<v Speaker 1>home yourself want to see when you're</v>

975
00:56:06.161 --> 00:56:11.161
<v Speaker 1>talking with other people does your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is your tendency to turn the</v>

976
00:56:11.830 --> 00:56:15.540
<v Speaker 1>conversation to ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means you're open.</v>

977
00:56:15.550 --> 00:56:16.840
<v Speaker 1>That's a trait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Openness.</v>

978
00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:20.020
<v Speaker 1>If you tend to turn the conversation to</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas,</v>

979
00:56:20.410 --> 00:56:22.870
<v Speaker 1>then you're yearning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're already,</v>

980
00:56:23.850 --> 00:56:24.070
<v Speaker 1>you're</v>

981
00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:26.860
<v Speaker 4>old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That that's a good reason to be a</v>

982
00:56:26.861 --> 00:56:31.850
<v Speaker 4>professor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't know if your mom can you talk</v>

983
00:56:31.851 --> 00:56:34.570
<v Speaker 4>to your friends and want you use most of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the time to talk about people are</v>

984
00:56:34.571 --> 00:56:36.610
<v Speaker 4>meaning what he did last night here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those are fine.</v>

985
00:56:36.850 --> 00:56:40.250
<v Speaker 4>Those are cross probably needs more than</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're extroverted or maybe you talk</v>

986
00:56:40.251 --> 00:56:41.950
<v Speaker 4>about relationships and that means more</v>
<v Speaker 4>than that.</v>

987
00:56:41.951 --> 00:56:45.370
<v Speaker 4>You were agreeable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not really the kind of</v>

988
00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:50.290
<v Speaker 4>temperament that is suited for an</v>
<v Speaker 4>intellectual pursuit because it's about</v>

989
00:56:50.291 --> 00:56:53.720
<v Speaker 4>ideas fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you also have to ask some,</v>

990
00:56:53.890 --> 00:56:58.270
<v Speaker 4>what would you like to teach?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And teaching is teaching is brutal for</v>

991
00:56:58.271 --> 00:56:59.760
<v Speaker 4>people who don't want light.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

992
00:56:59.770 --> 00:57:01.720
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have professors like this,</v>

993
00:57:01.930 --> 00:57:05.020
<v Speaker 4>a standing in front of the board,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they look down,</v>

994
00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:07.660
<v Speaker 4>they mumble,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're so bloody terrified at the</v>

995
00:57:07.661 --> 00:57:08.950
<v Speaker 4>students.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They won't even look at them.</v>

996
00:57:08.951 --> 00:57:11.020
<v Speaker 4>And everyone there is like checking</v>
<v Speaker 4>facebook.</v>

997
00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:13.370
<v Speaker 4>It's all off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>

998
00:57:13.371 --> 00:57:16.420
<v Speaker 4>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you don't like to engage in audience,</v>

999
00:57:16.630 --> 00:57:20.260
<v Speaker 4>you're going to spend the most</v>
<v Speaker 4>exhausting part of your career teaching</v>

1000
00:57:20.261 --> 00:57:24.040
<v Speaker 4>because teaching,</v>
<v Speaker 4>teaching writing is very exhausting.</v>

1001
00:57:24.070 --> 00:57:26.860
<v Speaker 4>So there's three clinical work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but right up there it was teaching</v>

1002
00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:31.090
<v Speaker 4>because I lectures of performance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it takes a tremendous amount of energy</v>

1003
00:57:32.070 --> 00:57:34.840
<v Speaker 4>and who has to do with my role pins and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's boring.</v>

1004
00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:40.030
<v Speaker 4>But otherwise it's like spontaneous jazz</v>
<v Speaker 4>for 90 minutes.</v>

1005
00:57:40.031 --> 00:57:43.270
<v Speaker 4>It's very tiring.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when I teach three courses in the</v>

1006
00:57:43.270 --> 00:57:46.680
<v Speaker 4>spring,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just flooded by mark and I got a lot</v>

1007
00:57:46.681 --> 00:57:48.240
<v Speaker 4>of energy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you,</v>

1008
00:57:48.310 --> 00:57:52.080
<v Speaker 4>you also have to decide if you want that</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you'd have to just start.</v>

1009
00:57:52.420 --> 00:57:54.770
<v Speaker 4>Do you like mentoring students?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Graduate Students.</v>

1010
00:57:54.771 --> 00:57:56.610
<v Speaker 4>So I read it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got training,</v>

1011
00:57:56.630 --> 00:58:00.490
<v Speaker 4>I read it like I need a second.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really liked mentoring graduate</v>

1012
00:58:00.491 --> 00:58:02.320
<v Speaker 4>students.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it would be university professors.</v>

1013
00:58:02.380 --> 00:58:05.470
<v Speaker 4>Perfect for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got used to being rejected.</v>

1014
00:58:05.530 --> 00:58:07.900
<v Speaker 4>The paper's being rejected.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I learned how to deal with that in about</v>

1015
00:58:07.901 --> 00:58:10.300
<v Speaker 4>three or four years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He used to just piss me off.</v>

1016
00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:15.290
<v Speaker 4>I'd be naturally three months after or</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't have to get the envelope.</v>

1017
00:58:15.410 --> 00:58:19.100
<v Speaker 4>I open it cause he know what it says.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It says up here,</v>

1018
00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:24.990
<v Speaker 4>but you're learning off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Take that personally because it's not a</v>

1019
00:58:24.991 --> 00:58:29.991
<v Speaker 4>person and just hate everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you learn to tolerate,</v>

1020
00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:34.250
<v Speaker 4>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now you ask me why he would be a</v>

1021
00:58:34.251 --> 00:58:36.370
<v Speaker 4>clinical psychologist as well as the</v>
<v Speaker 4>professor.</v>

1022
00:58:40.910 --> 00:58:45.910
<v Speaker 4>That depends to some degree on what kind</v>
<v Speaker 4>of breadth of experience you were in</v>

1023
00:58:46.191 --> 00:58:47.750
<v Speaker 4>corn towards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

1024
00:58:49.890 --> 00:58:50.723
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1025
00:58:50.900 --> 00:58:53.870
<v Speaker 4>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>life is better if I'm doing a lot of</v>

1026
00:58:53.871 --> 00:58:57.110
<v Speaker 4>different things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so being a clinician,</v>

1027
00:58:57.111 --> 00:58:58.670
<v Speaker 4>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a clinician,</v>

1028
00:58:59.330 --> 00:59:04.330
<v Speaker 4>I do consulting with businesses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a professor and I run a little</v>

1029
00:59:05.070 --> 00:59:08.600
<v Speaker 4>testing company that evaluates</v>
<v Speaker 4>employees.</v>

1030
00:59:09.260 --> 00:59:11.670
<v Speaker 4>I have other,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am not been jobs.</v>

1031
00:59:11.690 --> 00:59:14.530
<v Speaker 4>I think I have seven jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I figured at one point it</v>

1032
00:59:14.540 --> 00:59:19.100
<v Speaker 4>fluctuates between five and seven.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the reason I do that because I</v>

1033
00:59:19.101 --> 00:59:24.050
<v Speaker 4>learned how to do flat out all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it turns out I'm kind of wired for that.</v>

1034
00:59:24.051 --> 00:59:27.380
<v Speaker 4>So it's better for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's better.</v>

1035
00:59:27.890 --> 00:59:30.230
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm loved doing clinical work.</v>

1036
00:59:30.890 --> 00:59:34.550
<v Speaker 4>It's sometimes people wonder too how you</v>
<v Speaker 4>can do it because you say more people</v>

1037
00:59:34.551 --> 00:59:36.350
<v Speaker 4>bring their problems to you all the</v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

1038
00:59:36.351 --> 00:59:41.351
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it like that because social work is</v>

1039
00:59:41.371 --> 00:59:42.980
<v Speaker 4>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

1040
00:59:43.010 --> 00:59:46.530
<v Speaker 4>I think you're insane to be a social</v>
<v Speaker 4>worker if they do with thinking about</v>

1041
00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:52.420
<v Speaker 4>all the jobs that we'll just hammer you</v>
<v Speaker 4>to death over a five year period that</v>

1042
00:59:52.761 --> 00:59:54.290
<v Speaker 4>I'm teaching junior high school kids.</v>

1043
00:59:57.780 --> 00:59:59.480
<v Speaker 4>But see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the thing about being a clinical</v>

1044
00:59:59.481 --> 01:00:01.850
<v Speaker 4>psychologist is the people who come to</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you have problems.</v>

1045
01:00:01.851 --> 01:00:05.090
<v Speaker 4>But they don't want to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why they're coming to see it</v>

1046
01:00:05.091 --> 01:00:07.070
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so what you're doing isn't dealing with</v>

1047
01:00:07.071 --> 01:00:09.860
<v Speaker 4>people who have promised.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're dealing with people who want you</v>

1048
01:00:09.861 --> 01:00:13.820
<v Speaker 4>to get rid of their problems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the trajectory is up hill and it</v>

1049
01:00:13.821 --> 01:00:16.850
<v Speaker 4>doesn't really matter how bad the curves</v>
<v Speaker 4>situation because if there's hope in the</v>

1050
01:00:16.851 --> 01:00:17.631
<v Speaker 4>future,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

1051
01:00:17.631 --> 01:00:19.740
<v Speaker 4>because you're oriented toward the</v>
<v Speaker 4>future.</v>

1052
01:00:19.741 --> 01:00:23.600
<v Speaker 4>And so if you're working with your</v>
<v Speaker 4>clients and they want to have better</v>

1053
01:00:23.601 --> 01:00:26.960
<v Speaker 4>lives and you're helping them do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's</v>

1054
01:00:29.770 --> 01:00:33.520
<v Speaker 4>it's a fine thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a great thing to be able to do</v>

1055
01:00:37.250 --> 01:00:42.250
<v Speaker 2>pursue the professorships instead of</v>
<v Speaker 2>full time clinician work because grab</v>

1056
01:00:43.491 --> 01:00:45.220
<v Speaker 2>her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>secure them that way.</v>

1057
01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:50.400
<v Speaker 4>It depends on the Grad program.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's two kinds of,</v>

1058
01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:53.880
<v Speaker 4>there's actually three kinds of clinical</v>
<v Speaker 4>graduate programs,</v>

1059
01:00:54.510 --> 01:00:58.530
<v Speaker 4>the graduate programs that are</v>
<v Speaker 4>characteristic of large research</v>

1060
01:00:58.531 --> 01:01:02.700
<v Speaker 4>institutions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So say like Miguel and Miguel is mostly</v>

1061
01:01:02.701 --> 01:01:07.701
<v Speaker 4>a scientific institute institution with</v>
<v Speaker 4>a side Bar of clinical training.</v>

1062
01:01:09.090 --> 01:01:11.450
<v Speaker 4>And most research institutions are like</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1063
01:01:11.850 --> 01:01:14.340
<v Speaker 4>And so most APA approved,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's how it used to be.</v>

1064
01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:15.810
<v Speaker 4>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>APA approved.</v>

1065
01:01:15.811 --> 01:01:20.811
<v Speaker 4>American psychological association group</v>
<v Speaker 4>of programs tend to be research oriented</v>

1066
01:01:21.890 --> 01:01:25.110
<v Speaker 4>and they provide technical training.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what they expect of you if you're a</v>

1067
01:01:25.111 --> 01:01:27.720
<v Speaker 4>student,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there has to be a scientist and to be</v>

1068
01:01:27.721 --> 01:01:31.530
<v Speaker 4>trained as a clinician.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now also Seidi programs,</v>

1069
01:01:31.531 --> 01:01:36.030
<v Speaker 4>they're more common in the U s they'll</v>
<v Speaker 4>charge about $40,000 a year annual</v>

1070
01:01:36.031 --> 01:01:40.410
<v Speaker 4>training basically just as a clinician.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then there are clinical programs</v>

1071
01:01:40.411 --> 01:01:43.490
<v Speaker 4>that are doing major research</v>
<v Speaker 4>institutions but are still stealing</v>

1072
01:01:43.770 --> 01:01:47.820
<v Speaker 4>public universities where most of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>emphasis is on clinical training and</v>

1073
01:01:47.821 --> 01:01:49.650
<v Speaker 4>classes on experimental work.</v>

1074
01:01:49.890 --> 01:01:54.830
<v Speaker 4>And they're usually not designed to Iran</v>
<v Speaker 4>on geared out producing academics who</v>

1075
01:01:54.831 --> 01:01:57.900
<v Speaker 4>could trade clinical psychologists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is what the big research</v>

1076
01:01:57.901 --> 01:01:59.490
<v Speaker 4>universities are for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And yeah,</v>

1077
01:01:59.510 --> 01:02:01.620
<v Speaker 4>often when you go there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we deal,</v>

1078
01:02:02.670 --> 01:02:04.470
<v Speaker 4>if you were a successful clinical</v>
<v Speaker 4>student,</v>

1079
01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:08.110
<v Speaker 4>he became a professor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was the unsuccessful clinic as</v>

1080
01:02:08.111 --> 01:02:11.280
<v Speaker 4>students who became a clinical</v>
<v Speaker 4>psychologist and you know,</v>

1081
01:02:11.281 --> 01:02:13.110
<v Speaker 4>you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well that's because that was all they</v>

1082
01:02:13.111 --> 01:02:13.841
<v Speaker 4>can do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>

1083
01:02:13.841 --> 01:02:18.570
<v Speaker 4>That's a cynical way of looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In some ways it's true because to be a</v>

1084
01:02:18.571 --> 01:02:21.620
<v Speaker 4>professor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a research institute like the Ot and the</v>

1085
01:02:21.621 --> 01:02:24.570
<v Speaker 4>clinical psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to be able to be a scientist</v>

1086
01:02:24.571 --> 01:02:25.404
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1087
01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:27.690
<v Speaker 4>and to do everything that's associated</v>
<v Speaker 4>with that.</v>

1088
01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:30.400
<v Speaker 4>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's,</v>

1089
01:02:30.690 --> 01:02:34.980
<v Speaker 4>it's a good option if you can pull it</v>
<v Speaker 4>off because you have all the stability</v>

1090
01:02:34.981 --> 01:02:38.090
<v Speaker 4>that he was alone with my in there in</v>
<v Speaker 4>university plus you have old</v>

1091
01:02:38.110 --> 01:02:41.540
<v Speaker 4>undergraduates and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you'd like them to graduates,</v>

1092
01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:44.520
<v Speaker 4>if you don't like undergraduates here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't like people,</v>

1093
01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:45.840
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause I mean undergraduate,</v>

1094
01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:47.960
<v Speaker 4>they're all shiny and clean and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

1095
01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:51.080
<v Speaker 4>they're all happy about their futures</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're all probably going to be</v>

1096
01:02:51.081 --> 01:02:52.190
<v Speaker 4>reasonably successful.</v>

1097
01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:55.840
<v Speaker 4>It cannot be able to undergraduates,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you might as well go big old crime until</v>

1098
01:02:55.841 --> 01:02:58.000
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because that's about as good as it gets</v>

1099
01:02:58.001 --> 01:03:00.190
<v Speaker 4>among human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1100
01:03:00.191 --> 01:03:03.360
<v Speaker 4>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so if you're a professor,</v>

1101
01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:05.800
<v Speaker 4>you get to stay in the happy meal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You and then,</v>

1102
01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:08.110
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do my clinical work in my consulting</v>

1103
01:03:08.111 --> 01:03:10.060
<v Speaker 4>work as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's sort of like the best of both</v>

1104
01:03:10.061 --> 01:03:12.190
<v Speaker 4>worlds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there's a lot of,</v>

1105
01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:15.790
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of preparation that goes</v>
<v Speaker 4>into doing all those things.</v>

1106
01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:19.330
<v Speaker 4>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to do,</v>

1107
01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:23.440
<v Speaker 4>I think I had been 2000 hours of</v>
<v Speaker 4>supervised practice when I came back to</v>

1108
01:03:23.441 --> 01:03:27.700
<v Speaker 4>Ontario after I was in Massachusetts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even though I was licensed in</v>

1109
01:03:27.701 --> 01:03:29.630
<v Speaker 4>Massachusetts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's,</v>

1110
01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:32.740
<v Speaker 4>if it takes quite a bit of work to keep</v>
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>

1111
01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:35.440
<v Speaker 4>cause just after you get your clinical</v>
<v Speaker 4>phd,</v>

1112
01:03:35.441 --> 01:03:36.910
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't have a psychologist yet,</v>

1113
01:03:36.911 --> 01:03:41.350
<v Speaker 4>you have to do another 2000 hours of</v>
<v Speaker 4>supervised practice.</v>

1114
01:03:41.860 --> 01:03:45.550
<v Speaker 4>And to do that as well as to do what you</v>
<v Speaker 4>need to do in order to pursue an</v>

1115
01:03:45.551 --> 01:03:49.430
<v Speaker 4>academic career means,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1116
01:03:49.750 --> 01:03:51.580
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you better be efficient.</v>

1117
01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:54.790
<v Speaker 4>So other questions?</v>

1118
01:03:59.120 --> 01:03:59.760
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1119
01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:02.250
<v Speaker 4>Is that a good play everyone?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Basically.</v>

1120
01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:04.670
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've heard from a lot of people that you</v>

1121
01:04:04.671 --> 01:04:09.671
<v Speaker 4>should look for supervisors who are</v>
<v Speaker 4>working on areas that Uri and the cat</v>

1122
01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:14.210
<v Speaker 4>straight a's in 98% do whatever you</v>
<v Speaker 4>want.</v>

1123
01:04:15.260 --> 01:04:19.370
<v Speaker 4>If you don't apply everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I would say even if you do apply</v>

1124
01:04:19.371 --> 01:04:21.090
<v Speaker 4>everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can almost say no.</v>

1125
01:04:21.950 --> 01:04:24.860
<v Speaker 4>You know what a delightful deal you</v>
<v Speaker 4>applied 40 places,</v>

1126
01:04:24.861 --> 01:04:27.050
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or 30 places for it realistically.</v>

1127
01:04:27.170 --> 01:04:31.580
<v Speaker 4>And four people give you an offer and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you fly out there and they try to tell</v>

1128
01:04:31.581 --> 01:04:33.790
<v Speaker 4>you how wonderful you are and try to get</v>
<v Speaker 4>you to come in.</v>

1129
01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:37.370
<v Speaker 4>You get to say no to three of them and</v>
<v Speaker 4>pick the best one that's deal.</v>

1130
01:04:38.090 --> 01:04:40.190
<v Speaker 4>So that's what you want to set yourself</v>
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>

1131
01:04:41.260 --> 01:04:42.370
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know if you,</v>

1132
01:04:42.371 --> 01:04:45.850
<v Speaker 4>if you really know what you want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is doubtful,</v>

1133
01:04:45.851 --> 01:04:50.040
<v Speaker 4>but maybe you do because sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 4>people do and you can specify who you'd</v>

1134
01:04:50.050 --> 01:04:52.060
<v Speaker 4>like to work with and they're interested</v>
<v Speaker 4>in.</v>

1135
01:04:52.061 --> 01:04:53.680
<v Speaker 4>You can target it that carefully.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

1136
01:04:53.681 --> 01:04:57.400
<v Speaker 4>more power to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's very rare and for most people</v>

1137
01:04:57.401 --> 01:04:59.260
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not a good strategy.</v>

1138
01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:01.960
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've had lots of students</v>

1139
01:05:03.590 --> 01:05:06.860
<v Speaker 4>asking you about how to get into,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well let's say specifically clinicals,</v>

1140
01:05:06.950 --> 01:05:09.830
<v Speaker 4>graduate school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I say applied in lots of places.</v>

1141
01:05:09.950 --> 01:05:12.440
<v Speaker 4>Then they don't they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why do you wait for places and their</v>

1142
01:05:12.441 --> 01:05:14.610
<v Speaker 4>threshold students and they don't get</v>
<v Speaker 4>here?</v>

1143
01:05:15.110 --> 01:05:16.430
<v Speaker 4>Well that's pretty rough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1144
01:05:16.431 --> 01:05:18.130
<v Speaker 4>they languished a year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes</v>

1145
01:05:18.130 --> 01:05:21.640
<v Speaker 1>two years as they try again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually by the second year of not giving</v>

1146
01:05:21.641 --> 01:05:23.830
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they listen and apply.</v>

1147
01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:27.360
<v Speaker 1>It's 30 places and then they get it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they think juicing will fire them.</v>

1148
01:05:27.410 --> 01:05:30.830
<v Speaker 1>That the first year I would have been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1149
01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:36.250
<v Speaker 1>waiting at the local bar for two years</v>
<v Speaker 1>while I was trying to get into graduate</v>

1150
01:05:36.251 --> 01:05:38.440
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if if,</v>

1151
01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:43.060
<v Speaker 1>if you're 100% credible and you've got</v>
<v Speaker 1>the inside track,</v>

1152
01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:45.550
<v Speaker 1>you know there's normal rules don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>apply to you,</v>

1153
01:05:45.551 --> 01:05:48.550
<v Speaker 1>then that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's a numbers game.</v>

1154
01:05:48.610 --> 01:05:50.890
<v Speaker 1>And with most things that are low</v>
<v Speaker 1>profitability,</v>

1155
01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:54.370
<v Speaker 1>the way you maximize your chances of</v>
<v Speaker 1>success has to do with the law.</v>

1156
01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:57.370
<v Speaker 1>As you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have a one in 10 chance of</v>

1157
01:05:57.371 --> 01:05:59.950
<v Speaker 1>getting into somewhere and you apply to</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 places,</v>

1158
01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:03.430
<v Speaker 1>you know you're probably going to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>into to.</v>

1159
01:06:04.150 --> 01:06:07.710
<v Speaker 1>But if you play eight places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might get unlucky and get it.</v>

1160
01:06:07.740 --> 01:06:08.573
<v Speaker 1>They're not</v>

1161
01:06:09.060 --> 01:06:09.893
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

1162
01:06:11.830 --> 01:06:14.570
<v Speaker 1>not here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not at St George Scarborough,</v>

1163
01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:17.690
<v Speaker 1>possibly they're working on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's hard to set up a clinical</v>

1164
01:06:17.700 --> 01:06:20.160
<v Speaker 1>program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need a lot of medical faculty and</v>

1165
01:06:20.161 --> 01:06:23.100
<v Speaker 1>you need to be tied in with hospitals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a multi year process.</v>

1166
01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:27.750
<v Speaker 1>So not this foreseeable future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but your classical clinical program,</v>

1167
01:06:27.751 --> 01:06:29.160
<v Speaker 1>Ryerson hasn't been program.</v>

1168
01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:30.133
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1169
01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:34.500
<v Speaker 1>Is there a clinical program or noisy or</v>
<v Speaker 1>counseling</v>

1170
01:06:36.530 --> 01:06:40.330
<v Speaker 1>is plentiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1171
01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:42.520
<v Speaker 1>Other questions?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1172
01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:47.630
<v Speaker 2>Change from advising students for quite</v>
<v Speaker 2>a psychology,</v>

1173
01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:53.600
<v Speaker 1>it's easier to like if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's easier to get into graduate school</v>

1174
01:06:54.050 --> 01:06:56.600
<v Speaker 1>if it's not clinically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does that mean?</v>

1175
01:06:56.601 --> 01:06:58.820
<v Speaker 1>It's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still hard,</v>

1176
01:06:58.821 --> 01:07:01.250
<v Speaker 1>but it's not an impossible like it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>with clinical.</v>

1177
01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:05.240
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem with that is that although</v>

1178
01:07:05.241 --> 01:07:06.580
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1179
01:07:06.581 --> 01:07:10.320
<v Speaker 1>it's moderately difficult we'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or even extremely difficult to get him</v>

1180
01:07:10.321 --> 01:07:15.321
<v Speaker 1>into an experimental program period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is is that when the</v>

1181
01:07:15.891 --> 01:07:20.891
<v Speaker 1>difficulty comes a little later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the difficulty then becomes getting a</v>

1182
01:07:20.961 --> 01:07:25.961
<v Speaker 1>job because it's just as hard to get a</v>
<v Speaker 1>job as a social psychologist as it is to</v>

1183
01:07:28.251 --> 01:07:32.060
<v Speaker 1>get a job as any other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean an academic job as any other</v>

1184
01:07:32.061 --> 01:07:35.930
<v Speaker 1>kinds of psychologists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the entry barrier for graduate school</v>

1185
01:07:35.931 --> 01:07:39.860
<v Speaker 1>is less at the entrance barrier into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>job market might even be higher.</v>

1186
01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:44.430
<v Speaker 1>So and so what you have to do is all</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing and group,</v>

1187
01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:44.840
<v Speaker 1>we've got it.</v>

1188
01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:48.710
<v Speaker 1>This is something to remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are not going to graduate school for</v>

1189
01:07:48.711 --> 01:07:52.190
<v Speaker 1>the classes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you want to do is barely packs</v>

1190
01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:56.690
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise you're working too</v>
<v Speaker 1>much on the classes because the classes</v>

1191
01:07:56.691 --> 01:08:00.110
<v Speaker 1>are useless there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to learn a damn thing</v>

1192
01:08:00.140 --> 01:08:02.330
<v Speaker 1>and all they do is take you away from</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you should be doing.</v>

1193
01:08:02.660 --> 01:08:05.810
<v Speaker 1>And what you shouldn't be doing is</v>
<v Speaker 1>publishing papers cause that's all that</v>

1194
01:08:05.811 --> 01:08:08.360
<v Speaker 1>matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you publish it on papers,</v>

1195
01:08:08.810 --> 01:08:13.810
<v Speaker 1>you'll get a job assuming that you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not flawed in some remark,</v>

1196
01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:17.970
<v Speaker 1>obvious other way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1197
01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:20.720
<v Speaker 1>so that you've got to remember that when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go to graduate school.</v>

1198
01:08:20.721 --> 01:08:23.900
<v Speaker 1>So if you pass and graduate course you</v>
<v Speaker 1>get a name.</v>

1199
01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:27.290
<v Speaker 1>That's how graduate courses work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything other than the name is that</v>

1200
01:08:27.291 --> 01:08:30.500
<v Speaker 1>failure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a bunch of complicated</v>

1201
01:08:30.501 --> 01:08:33.830
<v Speaker 1>reasons for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To pass the graduate class,</v>

1202
01:08:33.831 --> 01:08:36.200
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to do a decent job there.</v>

1203
01:08:36.220 --> 01:08:41.220
<v Speaker 1>They're easier than undergraduate costs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't matter.</v>

1204
01:08:41.810 --> 01:08:44.510
<v Speaker 1>You have to pass them because if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know picky on the program,</v>

1205
01:08:44.570 --> 01:08:46.340
<v Speaker 1>but if you passed them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's irrelevant.</v>

1206
01:08:46.341 --> 01:08:47.990
<v Speaker 1>No one cares.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's ever going to look at your</v>

1207
01:08:47.991 --> 01:08:52.940
<v Speaker 1>planning graduate transcript for grades</v>
<v Speaker 1>except for maybe the grant.</v>

1208
01:08:52.941 --> 01:08:55.860
<v Speaker 1>You know the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fellowship granting agency,</v>

1209
01:08:55.861 --> 01:08:58.850
<v Speaker 1>so that's the money exception,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you pass the course,</v>

1210
01:08:58.851 --> 01:09:01.600
<v Speaker 1>you get an a anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason you get a's if you passed the</v>

1211
01:09:01.601 --> 01:09:04.310
<v Speaker 1>courses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you don't get a,</v>

1212
01:09:05.150 --> 01:09:09.020
<v Speaker 1>let's say I give 30% of my graduate</v>
<v Speaker 1>students these,</v>

1213
01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:12.680
<v Speaker 1>then they don't get graduate fellowships</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the graduate fellowship programs</v>

1214
01:09:12.681 --> 01:09:16.310
<v Speaker 1>will only get a graduate fellowships to</v>
<v Speaker 1>students who have aids.</v>

1215
01:09:16.610 --> 01:09:20.780
<v Speaker 1>So the way the university is to to that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is you get a's if you pass,</v>

1216
01:09:20.810 --> 01:09:23.820
<v Speaker 1>otherwise you fail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to work hard enough to get</v>

1217
01:09:23.830 --> 01:09:25.220
<v Speaker 1>ready for the course to pass.</v>

1218
01:09:26.050 --> 01:09:29.180
<v Speaker 1>Have you done that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you have to work really hard to get</v>

1219
01:09:29.181 --> 01:09:31.990
<v Speaker 1>your down publications zone because</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1220
01:09:32.010 --> 01:09:35.840
<v Speaker 1>that's what will be them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how hot a prospect you are when you</v>

1221
01:09:35.841 --> 01:09:39.950
<v Speaker 1>graduate and you want to be in social</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology.</v>

1222
01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:44.210
<v Speaker 1>Each year was going to be five or six</v>
<v Speaker 1>strategies in North America.</v>

1223
01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:49.520
<v Speaker 1>Everyone wants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there the guys on the tail here and</v>

1224
01:09:49.521 --> 01:09:53.420
<v Speaker 1>then there's everyone else and everyone</v>
<v Speaker 1>else has a hell of a time.</v>

1225
01:09:53.700 --> 01:09:56.240
<v Speaker 1>It was top five students or six</v>
<v Speaker 1>students.</v>

1226
01:09:56.241 --> 01:09:59.030
<v Speaker 1>They have their pick of jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where you want to be.</v>

1227
01:09:59.180 --> 01:10:03.530
<v Speaker 1>And to do that you need to publish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bar keeps going up because he gets,</v>

1228
01:10:03.980 --> 01:10:06.380
<v Speaker 1>even though it's hard to publish because</v>
<v Speaker 1>people tell,</v>

1229
01:10:06.381 --> 01:10:10.790
<v Speaker 1>you know computers have made the process</v>
<v Speaker 1>more straightforward,</v>

1230
01:10:11.630 --> 01:10:13.970
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the journals are right at your</v>

1231
01:10:13.971 --> 01:10:15.860
<v Speaker 1>fingertips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to spend a day looking</v>

1232
01:10:15.861 --> 01:10:19.480
<v Speaker 1>for each journal like you did when I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a graduate student and then the journal</v>

1233
01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:22.280
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be there anyways cause you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>get them instantly and you can do your</v>

1234
01:10:22.281 --> 01:10:24.420
<v Speaker 1>stats on your lap car.</v>

1235
01:10:24.830 --> 01:10:29.830
<v Speaker 1>Whereas I had to use a mainframe in 1985</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I tell you manage for that nate name</v>

1236
01:10:29.861 --> 01:10:32.390
<v Speaker 1>for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I used a computer,</v>

1237
01:10:32.410 --> 01:10:36.710
<v Speaker 1>you know anything about statistics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The manual was as long as this table was</v>

1238
01:10:36.711 --> 01:10:40.520
<v Speaker 1>one book on metal rods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that law,</v>

1239
01:10:40.710 --> 01:10:45.710
<v Speaker 1>so like to do an a Nova was a nightmare</v>
<v Speaker 1>having just done so.</v>

1240
01:10:46.170 --> 01:10:49.640
<v Speaker 1>So some of the barriers to publication</v>
<v Speaker 1>number of followup,</v>

1241
01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:53.310
<v Speaker 1>but the consequences of that as the talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>students published form says learning</v>

1242
01:10:53.370 --> 01:10:54.860
<v Speaker 1>easier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just,</v>

1243
01:10:56.810 --> 01:10:59.840
<v Speaker 1>you have to spend the exactly the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of times you would have before</v>

1244
01:10:59.841 --> 01:11:02.060
<v Speaker 1>except now even though it's hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to,</v>

1245
01:11:02.061 --> 01:11:06.760
<v Speaker 1>you're going to need 10 to 12</v>
<v Speaker 1>publications and a couple of book</v>

1246
01:11:06.770 --> 01:11:09.390
<v Speaker 1>chapters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of those should be first offer.</v>

1247
01:11:09.410 --> 01:11:12.380
<v Speaker 1>You should be the first offer on five or</v>
<v Speaker 1>six of those papers and two of them</v>

1248
01:11:12.381 --> 01:11:14.370
<v Speaker 1>should be in picture and then you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>set.</v>

1249
01:11:14.370 --> 01:11:17.940
<v Speaker 1>But I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hit that you better do you run it</v>

1250
01:11:17.941 --> 01:11:19.360
<v Speaker 1>because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1251
01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:23.550
<v Speaker 1>it's not yet by and the students and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem with graduate school,</v>

1252
01:11:23.551 --> 01:11:25.080
<v Speaker 1>and this is something else to understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1253
01:11:26.260 --> 01:11:28.530
<v Speaker 1>people will leave you alone in Grad</v>
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>

1254
01:11:28.890 --> 01:11:32.220
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is you can float</v>
<v Speaker 1>around vacating for five years,</v>

1255
01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:35.280
<v Speaker 1>graduate with one publication and</v>
<v Speaker 1>disappeared.</v>

1256
01:11:36.930 --> 01:11:40.740
<v Speaker 1>So it's dangerous graduate schools</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous that way because no one would</v>

1257
01:11:40.741 --> 01:11:43.830
<v Speaker 1>be on your case to make sure that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the top students.</v>

1258
01:11:44.250 --> 01:11:47.010
<v Speaker 1>So you have lots of freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you are also ask yourself,</v>

1259
01:11:47.011 --> 01:11:49.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you want for him and Ken and</v>

1260
01:11:49.471 --> 01:11:51.870
<v Speaker 1>tolerate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do you want,</v>

1261
01:11:51.871 --> 01:11:54.750
<v Speaker 1>well people float drift if they have too</v>
<v Speaker 1>much freedom,</v>

1262
01:11:55.200 --> 01:12:00.030
<v Speaker 1>can you tolerate the questionnaires?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you discipline yourself enough to be</v>

1263
01:12:00.031 --> 01:12:02.400
<v Speaker 1>successful without someone?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically,</v>

1264
01:12:02.401 --> 01:12:04.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm watching you a big hey you in the</v>

1265
01:12:04.261 --> 01:12:05.160
<v Speaker 1>back of the hip.</v>

1266
01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:08.010
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a tough question because</v>

1267
01:12:09.690 --> 01:12:13.770
<v Speaker 1>it's not easy to become that future</v>
<v Speaker 1>oriented and that discipline.</v>

1268
01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:16.920
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's the social sector.</v>

1269
01:12:16.950 --> 01:12:19.710
<v Speaker 1>The other thing I also mentioned about</v>
<v Speaker 1>social psychologist,</v>

1270
01:12:19.870 --> 01:12:23.700
<v Speaker 1>learn of your psychometrics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause most of the social psychology is</v>

1271
01:12:23.701 --> 01:12:26.940
<v Speaker 1>nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a reason for that.</v>

1272
01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:31.160
<v Speaker 1>The reason is is that social</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologists don't do all this and that</v>

1273
01:12:31.210 --> 01:12:33.940
<v Speaker 1>very well and they're starting to clamp</v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

1274
01:12:33.950 --> 01:12:37.770
<v Speaker 1>Like all the journalists have adopted</v>
<v Speaker 1>the new code of ethics for publications</v>

1275
01:12:37.771 --> 01:12:41.880
<v Speaker 1>and reasonably done it because so much</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what particular this polished and</v>

1276
01:12:41.881 --> 01:12:46.120
<v Speaker 1>social psychology is simply not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So learner,</v>

1277
01:12:46.150 --> 01:12:48.330
<v Speaker 1>psychometrics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and third year statistics and that will</v>

1278
01:12:48.331 --> 01:12:51.960
<v Speaker 1>redo your website and social psych.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of things to be discovered</v>

1279
01:12:51.961 --> 01:12:55.320
<v Speaker 1>in social psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to be hard headed and not</v>

1280
01:12:55.350 --> 01:12:56.610
<v Speaker 1>eat after your career.</v>

1281
01:12:57.170 --> 01:13:02.170
<v Speaker 3>So</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't necessarily make sense or</v>

1282
01:13:03.370 --> 01:13:04.203
<v Speaker 3>missions.</v>

1283
01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:16.720
<v Speaker 1>How many good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what percentage of classes have you</v>

1284
01:13:16.721 --> 01:13:18.250
<v Speaker 1>taken in the last few that were good?</v>

1285
01:13:19.420 --> 01:13:23.110
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe.</v>

1286
01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:26.560
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there you go.</v>

1287
01:13:26.561 --> 01:13:30.820
<v Speaker 1>It's worse in graduate school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So 90% of the time in classes will be a</v>

1288
01:13:30.821 --> 01:13:32.950
<v Speaker 1>waste.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to learn to be a clinician?</v>

1289
01:13:32.980 --> 01:13:34.960
<v Speaker 1>You could start now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

1290
01:13:34.980 --> 01:13:35.980
<v Speaker 1>Carl Rogers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1291
01:13:35.981 --> 01:13:36.910
<v Speaker 1>Abraham,</v>
<v Speaker 1>NASA,</v>

1292
01:13:36.970 --> 01:13:38.950
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carl Young reading Sigmund Freud.</v>

1293
01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:41.620
<v Speaker 1>If there's lots of great clinicians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>read them,</v>

1294
01:13:41.980 --> 01:13:44.020
<v Speaker 1>read them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'll help a lot</v>

1295
01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:46.290
<v Speaker 3>isn't that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't that mean that the system is</v>

1296
01:13:46.291 --> 01:13:47.700
<v Speaker 3>flawed?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because yes,</v>

1297
01:13:48.700 --> 01:13:52.110
<v Speaker 1>all systems are flawed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of them are like really flawed</v>

1298
01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:54.670
<v Speaker 1>systems are murderers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're in a system and it's not</v>

1299
01:13:54.671 --> 01:13:56.950
<v Speaker 1>stopping you to death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually working.</v>

1300
01:13:56.951 --> 01:13:57.784
<v Speaker 1>Not too bad.</v>

1301
01:13:57.850 --> 01:14:02.850
<v Speaker 3>If you were supposed to be smart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are so wise.</v>

1302
01:14:04.870 --> 01:14:05.580
<v Speaker 3>One,</v>

1303
01:14:05.580 --> 01:14:08.610
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember earlier in the lecture I</v>

1304
01:14:08.611 --> 01:14:10.560
<v Speaker 1>thought we talk to you about businesses</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1305
01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:11.980
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>business is run</v>

1306
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:15.070
<v Speaker 4>on a 5% profit margin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That means they spin it.</v>

1307
01:14:15.071 --> 01:14:18.370
<v Speaker 4>And that's an efficient business because</v>
<v Speaker 4>most businesses fail.</v>

1308
01:14:18.670 --> 01:14:23.670
<v Speaker 4>So really well run businesses produce 5%</v>
<v Speaker 4>profit year after year.</v>

1309
01:14:24.100 --> 01:14:28.870
<v Speaker 4>That means they spend 95% of their time</v>
<v Speaker 4>just existed.</v>

1310
01:14:29.770 --> 01:14:32.590
<v Speaker 4>And that's how systems work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>System Spin,</v>

1311
01:14:32.980 --> 01:14:36.700
<v Speaker 4>good system spend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Only 95% of their time existed.</v>

1312
01:14:37.030 --> 01:14:40.630
<v Speaker 4>Bad system spend about 125% of their</v>
<v Speaker 4>time existed,</v>

1313
01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:44.650
<v Speaker 4>which means that not only do they not</v>
<v Speaker 4>produce anything of any value,</v>

1314
01:14:44.850 --> 01:14:48.230
<v Speaker 4>a sock resources from other things that</v>
<v Speaker 4>are producing things about.</v>

1315
01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.370
<v Speaker 4>And so really look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really important.</v>

1316
01:14:51.550 --> 01:14:54.910
<v Speaker 4>I know you're skeptical about this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's because you don't know what</v>

1317
01:14:54.911 --> 01:14:57.010
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about and you should</v>
<v Speaker 4>listen to me.</v>

1318
01:14:57.970 --> 01:15:02.290
<v Speaker 4>Most systems don't work and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 4>them are murderers.</v>

1319
01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:07.000
<v Speaker 4>And so if you go off to graduate school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not appointing hard cause you're</v>

1320
01:15:07.001 --> 01:15:09.130
<v Speaker 4>not this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No you're not.</v>

1321
01:15:09.780 --> 01:15:10.613
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well</v>

1322
01:15:12.550 --> 01:15:14.260
<v Speaker 4>that's what you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

1323
01:15:14.290 --> 01:15:15.123
<v Speaker 4>Another question.</v>

1324
01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:19.120
<v Speaker 2>What would you recommend to take the</v>
<v Speaker 2>gre?</v>

1325
01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:31.520
<v Speaker 4>Most people usually take it say in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>summer before they start two o'clock and</v>

1326
01:15:31.831 --> 01:15:35.730
<v Speaker 4>that's probably vote right because I</v>
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't push it too close to when you</v>

1327
01:15:35.820 --> 01:15:40.620
<v Speaker 4>applaud because it's just the</v>
<v Speaker 4>application process is stressful and you</v>

1328
01:15:40.621 --> 01:15:42.810
<v Speaker 4>probably would want to clutter that was</v>
<v Speaker 4>up much.</v>

1329
01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:48.330
<v Speaker 4>I would also say</v>
<v Speaker 4>people do a lot of study for the gre.</v>

1330
01:15:48.730 --> 01:15:52.110
<v Speaker 4>It's north at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you want like the one thing you can</v>

1331
01:15:52.111 --> 01:15:56.440
<v Speaker 4>study for is the psychology of Uri and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the best way to do now sprawling</v>

1332
01:15:56.470 --> 01:16:01.470
<v Speaker 4>breeding introductory textbook or two.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I wouldn't kill yourself spending</v>

1333
01:16:02.191 --> 01:16:06.300
<v Speaker 4>for the dra because it's not going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>help that much.</v>

1334
01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:10.760
<v Speaker 4>So part of it because it's like the</v>
<v Speaker 4>vocabulary that said</v>

1335
01:16:12.690 --> 01:16:16.770
<v Speaker 4>if build up your vocabulary over rated</v>
<v Speaker 4>to 25,000 hours of studying,</v>

1336
01:16:17.310 --> 01:16:18.780
<v Speaker 4>add another hundred hours for that</v>

1337
01:16:19.740 --> 01:16:22.370
<v Speaker 2>strong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1338
01:16:24.450 --> 01:16:27.510
<v Speaker 4>during the summer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe early fall and then you probably</v>

1339
01:16:27.511 --> 01:16:31.680
<v Speaker 4>have to apply from November to January.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So anyways,</v>

1340
01:16:31.681 --> 01:16:34.790
<v Speaker 4>back to your question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you want to,</v>

1341
01:16:34.830 --> 01:16:36.360
<v Speaker 4>what do you have to do with the</v>
<v Speaker 4>university?</v>

1342
01:16:36.361 --> 01:16:40.170
<v Speaker 4>And this is what you have to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Graduate School as well is what the</v>

1343
01:16:40.171 --> 01:16:43.770
<v Speaker 4>institution does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it opens up the space of identity and</v>

1344
01:16:43.771 --> 01:16:46.080
<v Speaker 4>the identity is you're a graduate</v>
<v Speaker 4>student.</v>

1345
01:16:46.590 --> 01:16:47.850
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what does that mean?</v>

1346
01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:50.820
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it means any number of things.</v>

1347
01:16:50.821 --> 01:16:53.160
<v Speaker 4>It means you can language for five years</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you want.</v>

1348
01:16:53.460 --> 01:16:57.150
<v Speaker 4>But what it does mean is now you have a</v>
<v Speaker 4>stamp of approval on your forehead.</v>

1349
01:16:57.750 --> 01:17:02.370
<v Speaker 4>And so you sit around and read and learn</v>
<v Speaker 4>things and you don't have to worry about</v>

1350
01:17:02.371 --> 01:17:06.750
<v Speaker 4>whether or not you're useful because</v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone has said by all of the possible</v>

1351
01:17:06.751 --> 01:17:10.170
<v Speaker 4>measurement you appear to be useful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that means you can get to have the</v>

1352
01:17:10.171 --> 01:17:11.570
<v Speaker 4>luxury and educating yourself.</v>

1353
01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:15.470
<v Speaker 4>Now you can go off to the institution</v>
<v Speaker 4>and 90% of the courses won't be</v>

1354
01:17:15.471 --> 01:17:17.660
<v Speaker 4>worthwhile just like they are hammering</v>
<v Speaker 4>institution.</v>

1355
01:17:17.930 --> 01:17:20.180
<v Speaker 4>But some of them will be really</v>
<v Speaker 4>worthwhile.</v>

1356
01:17:20.660 --> 01:17:23.780
<v Speaker 4>And so your job is to discriminate</v>
<v Speaker 4>between the things that are worthwhile.</v>

1357
01:17:23.781 --> 01:17:28.550
<v Speaker 4>I'm the thing is the dark and to really</v>
<v Speaker 4>focus on where you can get educated and</v>

1358
01:17:28.551 --> 01:17:30.470
<v Speaker 4>there's lots of places to get educated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1359
01:17:30.471 --> 01:17:33.960
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll have your placements and you'll</v>

1360
01:17:33.980 --> 01:17:38.420
<v Speaker 4>have clients and you'll learn I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's an opportunity right there to</v>

1361
01:17:38.421 --> 01:17:40.250
<v Speaker 4>learn because that would be the real</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

1362
01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:44.300
<v Speaker 4>And you will need people who know what</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're talking about and you want to</v>

1363
01:17:44.301 --> 01:17:46.770
<v Speaker 4>stick to them like glue because they'll</v>
<v Speaker 4>teach you fixed.</v>

1364
01:17:47.170 --> 01:17:50.960
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's okay that systems don't work</v>

1365
01:17:50.961 --> 01:17:55.070
<v Speaker 4>very well because they have to spend</v>
<v Speaker 4>most of their time just existed because</v>

1366
01:17:55.071 --> 01:17:56.880
<v Speaker 4>they're complicated things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1367
01:17:57.090 --> 01:18:01.040
<v Speaker 4>So</v>
<v Speaker 4>the reason I use the business example is</v>

1368
01:18:01.041 --> 01:18:04.700
<v Speaker 4>because businesses pay a big price for</v>
<v Speaker 4>inefficiency.</v>

1369
01:18:04.950 --> 01:18:07.160
<v Speaker 4>They just do was dive into the ground</v>
<v Speaker 4>and disappeared.</v>

1370
01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:12.400
<v Speaker 4>And so if even a business can only</v>
<v Speaker 4>manage 5% genuine productivity,</v>

1371
01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:18.240
<v Speaker 4>that keeps you a rule of thumb against</v>
<v Speaker 4>what she should judge institutions in</v>

1372
01:18:18.651 --> 01:18:21.140
<v Speaker 4>general,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's hard to make something work.</v>

1373
01:18:21.141 --> 01:18:24.110
<v Speaker 4>And when you look around the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most countries don't work.</v>

1374
01:18:24.140 --> 01:18:28.150
<v Speaker 4>Most governmental systems don't work and</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of them get so out of control that</v>

1375
01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:31.640
<v Speaker 4>they killed him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what you hope for you hope you can</v>

1376
01:18:31.641 --> 01:18:36.590
<v Speaker 4>get into somewhere that has possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 4>opens up a space for you to do what you</v>

1377
01:18:36.591 --> 01:18:38.630
<v Speaker 4>can do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're disciplined and ready to go up</v>

1378
01:18:38.631 --> 01:18:41.610
<v Speaker 4>and that's good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the classes,</v>

1379
01:18:41.650 --> 01:18:43.490
<v Speaker 4>moderate classes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not going to be worthwhile.</v>

1380
01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:45.900
<v Speaker 4>That's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You put in as much effort as you need</v>

1381
01:18:45.901 --> 01:18:49.550
<v Speaker 4>you to pass them and you pay attention</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the things outside of that where</v>

1382
01:18:49.551 --> 01:18:50.540
<v Speaker 4>you're actually learning.</v>

1383
01:18:51.550 --> 01:18:52.383
<v Speaker 3>Awesome.</v>

1384
01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:57.980
<v Speaker 4>Well it depends on the institution that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you go to.</v>

1385
01:18:58.040 --> 01:19:01.340
<v Speaker 4>Like if you go into a psy d program,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is just professional training,</v>

1386
01:19:01.460 --> 01:19:03.980
<v Speaker 4>they won't care if you published.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not trying to produce people who</v>

1387
01:19:03.981 --> 01:19:07.250
<v Speaker 4>are scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The idea with the ADA programs is that</v>

1388
01:19:07.251 --> 01:19:11.570
<v Speaker 4>you cannot be a good clinician unless</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're a scientist and there's some real</v>

1389
01:19:11.571 --> 01:19:14.870
<v Speaker 4>truth and that's what the issue is</v>
<v Speaker 4>really hurt people.</v>

1390
01:19:15.420 --> 01:19:17.210
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Didn't mess up someone's memory.</v>

1391
01:19:17.330 --> 01:19:19.610
<v Speaker 4>No trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're a foolish clinician,</v>

1392
01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:25.240
<v Speaker 4>you can cause a lot of misery and grief</v>
<v Speaker 4>because people especially confused in</v>

1393
01:19:25.441 --> 01:19:28.610
<v Speaker 4>vain people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll open themselves up to you and</v>

1394
01:19:29.090 --> 01:19:32.430
<v Speaker 4>you can that and whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh Kevin,</v>

1395
01:19:32.490 --> 01:19:37.190
<v Speaker 4>biases and lack of clarity you bring to</v>
<v Speaker 4>the situation has every possibility of</v>

1396
01:19:37.191 --> 01:19:39.560
<v Speaker 4>making things worse for them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1397
01:19:39.561 --> 01:19:42.820
<v Speaker 4>so the big research institutions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they want to train the thing</v>

1398
01:19:42.990 --> 01:19:44.560
<v Speaker 3>critically and</v>

1399
01:19:47.100 --> 01:19:50.460
<v Speaker 4>as a critical thinker is someone who's</v>
<v Speaker 4>good at getting rid of what isn't</v>

1400
01:19:50.461 --> 01:19:53.770
<v Speaker 4>necessary and keeping what is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1401
01:19:54.050 --> 01:19:55.860
<v Speaker 4>often when you think of critical</v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking,</v>

1402
01:19:55.861 --> 01:19:57.730
<v Speaker 4>you think of criticizing things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1403
01:19:57.990 --> 01:20:00.090
<v Speaker 4>this isn't good at that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If that isn't the point,</v>

1404
01:20:00.091 --> 01:20:03.520
<v Speaker 4>the point is to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well that's not as good as this,</v>

1405
01:20:03.521 --> 01:20:06.150
<v Speaker 4>so I'll keep this is that it isn't as</v>
<v Speaker 4>good as this.</v>

1406
01:20:06.180 --> 01:20:09.810
<v Speaker 4>It's what you do when you the pain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get rid of what's not perfect,</v>

1407
01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:12.780
<v Speaker 4>keep the rest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's what you have to do when you</v>

1408
01:20:12.781 --> 01:20:15.210
<v Speaker 4>go and get educated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As a graduate student,</v>

1409
01:20:15.211 --> 01:20:19.620
<v Speaker 4>I would say if you want to be a</v>
<v Speaker 4>clinician re the great clinicians,</v>

1410
01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:24.810
<v Speaker 4>you'll learn more from them then then</v>
<v Speaker 4>then from anyone else except your</v>

1411
01:20:24.811 --> 01:20:29.811
<v Speaker 4>clients and with your clients.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Best thing to do with them is listened</v>

1412
01:20:29.851 --> 01:20:33.600
<v Speaker 4>to them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is something that Carl Rogers,</v>

1413
01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:35.340
<v Speaker 4>that's one good reason to recall.</v>

1414
01:20:35.390 --> 01:20:37.860
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one thing that will Carl Rogers is he</v>

1415
01:20:37.861 --> 01:20:42.861
<v Speaker 4>really figured out her list and people</v>
<v Speaker 4>love to be listened to because most</v>

1416
01:20:43.501 --> 01:20:47.400
<v Speaker 4>people don't have anybody to talk to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And because they don't have anybody to</v>

1417
01:20:47.401 --> 01:20:49.260
<v Speaker 4>talk to you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can't organize their brands.</v>

1418
01:20:49.290 --> 01:20:51.930
<v Speaker 4>Because the way people organize their</v>
<v Speaker 4>brains is by talking.</v>

1419
01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:52.861
<v Speaker 4>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1420
01:20:52.861 --> 01:20:55.380
<v Speaker 4>I've got this problem and I don't know</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do about it.</v>

1421
01:20:55.410 --> 01:20:56.011
<v Speaker 4>So he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1422
01:20:56.011 --> 01:20:57.360
<v Speaker 4>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's the problem?</v>

1423
01:20:57.390 --> 01:20:58.200
<v Speaker 4>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1424
01:20:58.200 --> 01:21:00.690
<v Speaker 4>it might be this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it might be that you might be this,</v>

1425
01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:04.290
<v Speaker 4>maybe it's this reminds me of bath.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's like they're laying out the</v>

1426
01:21:04.291 --> 01:21:05.970
<v Speaker 4>situation on the table.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we say,</v>

1427
01:21:05.971 --> 01:21:07.770
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we keep telling me less laying the whole</v>

1428
01:21:07.771 --> 01:21:09.780
<v Speaker 4>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then they're afraid of that because</v>

1429
01:21:09.781 --> 01:21:10.980
<v Speaker 4>they don't want to weigh in the whole</v>
<v Speaker 4>problem.</v>

1430
01:21:11.110 --> 01:21:12.600
<v Speaker 4>So you convinced them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's okay,</v>

1431
01:21:12.620 --> 01:21:15.810
<v Speaker 4>lay the whole problem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll worry about sorting it afterwards.</v>

1432
01:21:15.990 --> 01:21:18.990
<v Speaker 4>So they made the whole problem and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>they look at it and you think,</v>

1433
01:21:18.991 --> 01:21:21.060
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well this isn't really the problem and</v>

1434
01:21:21.061 --> 01:21:22.860
<v Speaker 4>neither is this and this isn't the</v>
<v Speaker 4>problem with it.</v>

1435
01:21:22.861 --> 01:21:27.410
<v Speaker 4>Neither is that this is the parole.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then it sorta cut down to size right</v>

1436
01:21:27.420 --> 01:21:28.920
<v Speaker 4>off the bat when you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1437
01:21:29.730 --> 01:21:31.880
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you want to have happen?</v>

1438
01:21:32.630 --> 01:21:34.230
<v Speaker 4>So I'm not sure what I want to have</v>
<v Speaker 4>happen.</v>

1439
01:21:34.231 --> 01:21:37.900
<v Speaker 4>So they lay all that out and then they</v>
<v Speaker 4>push away what is it necessary.</v>

1440
01:21:37.901 --> 01:21:41.170
<v Speaker 4>Now they have the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now they'd have what they would like as</v>

1441
01:21:41.171 --> 01:21:42.700
<v Speaker 4>a solution.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you say,</v>

1442
01:21:42.701 --> 01:21:44.110
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well you know,</v>

1443
01:21:44.260 --> 01:21:47.950
<v Speaker 4>what steps can we institute little</v>
<v Speaker 4>stamps that you would actually do to</v>

1444
01:21:48.640 --> 01:21:50.650
<v Speaker 4>transform this problem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you to this solution.</v>

1445
01:21:51.340 --> 01:21:54.130
<v Speaker 4>And that's very entertaining.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very useful for people.</v>

1446
01:21:54.700 --> 01:21:58.750
<v Speaker 4>And so one of the things you can do</v>
<v Speaker 4>right off the bat is a junior clinician</v>

1447
01:21:58.751 --> 01:22:00.580
<v Speaker 4>is listen to the person.</v>

1448
01:22:00.790 --> 01:22:02.530
<v Speaker 4>And if you don't understand what you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>saying,</v>

1449
01:22:02.590 --> 01:22:03.880
<v Speaker 4>just ask them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Say,</v>

1450
01:22:03.881 --> 01:22:05.890
<v Speaker 4>no I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can get that.</v>

1451
01:22:05.891 --> 01:22:07.480
<v Speaker 4>So I'm clear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or maybe you say,</v>

1452
01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:10.300
<v Speaker 4>you just said that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but 10 minutes ago you said this and</v>

1453
01:22:10.301 --> 01:22:13.540
<v Speaker 4>they seem to be opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I don't understand how those two</v>

1454
01:22:13.541 --> 01:22:17.020
<v Speaker 4>things can both be true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And by doing it any walk them through</v>

1455
01:22:17.021 --> 01:22:19.270
<v Speaker 4>the process,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like your brain is organized at the</v>

1456
01:22:19.271 --> 01:22:24.271
<v Speaker 4>highest level linguistically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so if you walked through people</v>

1457
01:22:24.371 --> 01:22:28.460
<v Speaker 4>through a process of carefully</v>
<v Speaker 4>articulating their situation in order,</v>

1458
01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:33.480
<v Speaker 4>this is the brain and you can do that as</v>
<v Speaker 4>soon as a pretty junior clinicians as</v>

1459
01:22:33.521 --> 01:22:36.280
<v Speaker 4>long as you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as long as you're listening.</v>

1460
01:22:37.110 --> 01:22:39.170
<v Speaker 2>So yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would she say?</v>

1461
01:22:47.050 --> 01:22:48.790
<v Speaker 4>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1462
01:22:49.480 --> 01:22:51.910
<v Speaker 4>well I think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's two things you need to be</v>

1463
01:22:51.911 --> 01:22:56.110
<v Speaker 4>motivated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why do you need to have a clear</v>

1464
01:22:56.111 --> 01:23:00.100
<v Speaker 4>conception of what your life could be</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if it was really good.</v>

1465
01:23:01.060 --> 01:23:02.530
<v Speaker 4>So I can say if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is,</v>

1466
01:23:02.531 --> 01:23:05.350
<v Speaker 4>oh by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's an extra sentence you guys do.</v>

1467
01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:06.180
<v Speaker 4>If you do this,</v>

1468
01:23:06.180 --> 01:23:10.150
<v Speaker 1>we'll help you with what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go to this website</v>

1469
01:23:17.090 --> 01:23:20.210
<v Speaker 1>and there's four exercises there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're writing exercises and if you do,</v>

1470
01:23:20.211 --> 01:23:24.320
<v Speaker 1>then I knew that I knew would be like</v>
<v Speaker 1>three times as efficient as you are now.</v>

1471
01:23:24.890 --> 01:23:27.830
<v Speaker 1>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One exercise I'll ask you,</v>

1472
01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:31.070
<v Speaker 1>write an autobiography.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other is another exercise,</v>

1473
01:23:31.170 --> 01:23:33.980
<v Speaker 1>Alaska,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do some personality analysis to</v>

1474
01:23:33.981 --> 01:23:36.710
<v Speaker 1>figure out what your faults are and how</v>
<v Speaker 1>you overcome them.</v>

1475
01:23:36.711 --> 01:23:38.360
<v Speaker 1>Another one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last few to figure out what your</v>

1476
01:23:38.361 --> 01:23:40.790
<v Speaker 1>virtues are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you can capitalize on them.</v>

1477
01:23:41.090 --> 01:23:44.360
<v Speaker 1>And then the last one asks you to figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

1478
01:23:44.580 --> 01:23:46.760
<v Speaker 1>here's wanted to ask you to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically it says,</v>

1479
01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:48.590
<v Speaker 1>here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to get yourself in the right</v>

1480
01:23:48.591 --> 01:23:50.240
<v Speaker 1>state of mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's the state of mind.</v>

1481
01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:54.560
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that you were taking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were charged with taking care of</v>

1482
01:23:54.561 --> 01:23:56.360
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

1483
01:23:56.970 --> 01:23:59.140
<v Speaker 1>So now you're someone that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to take care of.</v>

1484
01:23:59.510 --> 01:24:03.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't care what you think of yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>because people are [inaudible],</v>

1485
01:24:04.140 --> 01:24:06.310
<v Speaker 1>you know you don't take care of himself</v>
<v Speaker 1>very well.</v>

1486
01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:09.860
<v Speaker 1>Put that aside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to assume you're going to</v>

1487
01:24:09.861 --> 01:24:12.350
<v Speaker 1>take care of yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're going to figure out what would</v>

1488
01:24:12.351 --> 01:24:15.650
<v Speaker 1>be best for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not what you want or what would make you</v>

1489
01:24:15.651 --> 01:24:18.200
<v Speaker 1>happy or any of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would be best for him.</v>

1490
01:24:18.730 --> 01:24:22.940
<v Speaker 1>So you need to have a vision of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can ask yourself that three to</v>

1491
01:24:22.941 --> 01:24:27.170
<v Speaker 1>five years ago I had the best life I</v>
<v Speaker 1>could have.</v>

1492
01:24:28.100 --> 01:24:29.030
<v Speaker 1>What would that be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like?</v>

1493
01:24:29.450 --> 01:24:34.450
<v Speaker 1>Loneliness or exercise kind of steps you</v>
<v Speaker 1>through that and asks you to think about</v>

1494
01:24:34.610 --> 01:24:38.510
<v Speaker 1>people you admire or you think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>your friends and your family and your</v>

1495
01:24:38.511 --> 01:24:41.450
<v Speaker 1>career and the way you structured your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life day to day.</v>

1496
01:24:41.630 --> 01:24:46.630
<v Speaker 1>And you try to meditate on what that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be like if it was off demised.</v>

1497
01:24:48.370 --> 01:24:49.190
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

1498
01:24:49.190 --> 01:24:54.190
<v Speaker 1>and then the exercise steps you through</v>
<v Speaker 1>a process of clarifying that.</v>

1499
01:24:56.270 --> 01:24:57.770
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now that's your little vision of</v>

1500
01:24:57.771 --> 01:25:00.110
<v Speaker 1>habit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1501
01:25:00.111 --> 01:25:03.170
<v Speaker 1>so now you've got that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what your life could be like if</v>

1502
01:25:03.171 --> 01:25:04.640
<v Speaker 1>you were living at brock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1503
01:25:04.641 --> 01:25:07.520
<v Speaker 1>now you need to do the opposite of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which this program,</v>

1504
01:25:07.521 --> 01:25:12.260
<v Speaker 1>why do we also asking everybody has a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of how they can fall apart.</v>

1505
01:25:13.070 --> 01:25:16.850
<v Speaker 1>All you do is look at how you already</v>
<v Speaker 1>have fallen apart and then you multiply</v>

1506
01:25:16.851 --> 01:25:21.000
<v Speaker 1>it out and you think of up with people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you see on the street or that you</v>

1507
01:25:21.130 --> 01:25:25.040
<v Speaker 1>and you seen devastated marriages or who</v>
<v Speaker 1>have terrible relationships with your</v>

1508
01:25:25.041 --> 01:25:26.660
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you think,</v>

1509
01:25:26.661 --> 01:25:30.920
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would my life be like if I really</v>

1510
01:25:30.921 --> 01:25:34.600
<v Speaker 1>let it fall apart?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you meditate on that property,</v>

1511
01:25:34.610 --> 01:25:38.600
<v Speaker 1>that should really scary and it's just</v>
<v Speaker 1>hearing the deeply.</v>

1512
01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:41.660
<v Speaker 1>So you should pick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no way I'm doing that.</v>

1513
01:25:42.470 --> 01:25:46.520
<v Speaker 1>What ever happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not giving that.</v>

1514
01:25:46.760 --> 01:25:50.870
<v Speaker 1>So then you've got your little happen</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you've got your little hat and you</v>

1515
01:25:50.871 --> 01:25:55.160
<v Speaker 1>know what the difference between,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you can start to conceive of</v>

1516
01:25:55.161 --> 01:25:57.950
<v Speaker 1>your day to day life in relationship to</v>
<v Speaker 1>those two things.</v>

1517
01:25:58.610 --> 01:26:03.610
<v Speaker 1>And you can decide which one you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does he do that proper?</v>

1518
01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:09.140
<v Speaker 4>I get hit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a DD process because if your life</v>

1519
01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:14.440
<v Speaker 4>really gets out of control,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not only you are you miserable beyond</v>

1520
01:26:14.901 --> 01:26:18.920
<v Speaker 4>comprehension but still perfectly</v>
<v Speaker 4>capable of making it worse,</v>

1521
01:26:19.170 --> 01:26:24.170
<v Speaker 4>you're a little source of community</v>
<v Speaker 4>pathobiology everywhere you go you make</v>

1522
01:26:24.291 --> 01:26:27.620
<v Speaker 4>it worse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's how really that really is</v>

1523
01:26:27.621 --> 01:26:30.650
<v Speaker 4>hell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I would recommend that state.</v>

1524
01:26:31.130 --> 01:26:34.650
<v Speaker 4>I would recommend that you stay as far</v>
<v Speaker 4>away from here as you possibly can.</v>

1525
01:26:35.750 --> 01:26:39.380
<v Speaker 4>So you need to know those extremes cause</v>
<v Speaker 4>those are like the extremes of human</v>

1526
01:26:39.381 --> 01:26:42.290
<v Speaker 4>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you need to know that they exist and</v>

1527
01:26:42.291 --> 01:26:46.130
<v Speaker 4>what they are for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you can construe your existence</v>

1528
01:26:46.131 --> 01:26:49.820
<v Speaker 4>in relationship to those two things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that can help me feel motivated.</v>

1529
01:26:51.020 --> 01:26:51.853
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1530
01:26:53.250 --> 01:26:55.440
<v Speaker 4>and in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's good to do it as a meditative</v>

1531
01:26:55.460 --> 01:26:58.440
<v Speaker 4>process.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Making meditatively is different than</v>

1532
01:26:58.441 --> 01:27:02.450
<v Speaker 4>thinking in a directive way cause it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so here's a meditative exercises.</v>

1533
01:27:02.451 --> 01:27:04.640
<v Speaker 4>You can try this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a very useful exercise.</v>

1534
01:27:04.641 --> 01:27:07.800
<v Speaker 4>So try this tomorrow morning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you do this regular,</v>

1535
01:27:07.801 --> 01:27:10.930
<v Speaker 4>you'll change your life and sees it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a simple thing to do.</v>

1536
01:27:10.950 --> 01:27:15.950
<v Speaker 4>Technically sit on the edge of your bed</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you wake up and ask yourself like</v>

1537
01:27:16.081 --> 01:27:19.380
<v Speaker 4>you were asking</v>
<v Speaker 4>a friend,</v>

1538
01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:22.950
<v Speaker 4>not someone you knew well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but some of you,</v>

1539
01:27:23.070 --> 01:27:26.550
<v Speaker 4>you have positive feelings towards you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'd like for things to go well for</v>

1540
01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:31.560
<v Speaker 4>this person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ask yourself what you could do to make</v>

1541
01:27:31.741 --> 01:27:36.420
<v Speaker 4>the day progressed in the best possible</v>
<v Speaker 4>manner.</v>

1542
01:27:36.900 --> 01:27:40.710
<v Speaker 4>So you ask yourself what you could do to</v>
<v Speaker 4>do that.</v>

1543
01:27:40.770 --> 01:27:43.410
<v Speaker 4>And then you ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you actually would?</v>

1544
01:27:44.700 --> 01:27:46.710
<v Speaker 4>And you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll get an answer and the answer will</v>

1545
01:27:46.711 --> 01:27:49.680
<v Speaker 4>drift up from the depths of your</v>
<v Speaker 4>unconscious.</v>

1546
01:27:49.681 --> 01:27:50.514
<v Speaker 4>You'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1547
01:27:50.670 --> 01:27:53.400
<v Speaker 4>here's things that I've been avoided.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I should have,</v>

1548
01:27:53.401 --> 01:27:54.830
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>chip away at those are the event.</v>

1549
01:27:54.831 --> 01:27:59.831
<v Speaker 4>And maybe I'd be this little thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>without getting hosanna full about it.</v>

1550
01:28:01.140 --> 01:28:06.000
<v Speaker 4>And then tonight my life would be one</v>
<v Speaker 4>10th of 1% better.</v>

1551
01:28:07.290 --> 01:28:10.620
<v Speaker 4>Just very much to go to admission for</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone who isn't very disciplined.</v>

1552
01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:16.170
<v Speaker 4>But one 10th of 1% is the law.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one in a thousand days at one 10th of</v>

1553
01:28:16.171 --> 01:28:19.050
<v Speaker 4>1% if no compounding,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a hundred percent better.</v>

1554
01:28:20.610 --> 01:28:21.443
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1555
01:28:22.450 --> 01:28:24.520
<v Speaker 4>those things can be motivated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the things,</v>

1556
01:28:24.700 --> 01:28:26.470
<v Speaker 4>one of the things I've learned from my</v>
<v Speaker 4>own research,</v>

1557
01:28:26.500 --> 01:28:28.380
<v Speaker 4>because I do a lot of research and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>can tell Jerry,</v>

1558
01:28:28.381 --> 01:28:32.470
<v Speaker 4>is because it was very interested in why</v>
<v Speaker 4>people were motivated to do terrible</v>

1559
01:28:32.471 --> 01:28:35.860
<v Speaker 4>things to other b.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the reason they're motivated to do</v>

1560
01:28:35.861 --> 01:28:38.020
<v Speaker 4>terrible things is because they left</v>
<v Speaker 4>their vice fall.</v>

1561
01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:40.360
<v Speaker 4>And your life is hard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1562
01:28:40.361 --> 01:28:43.980
<v Speaker 4>If your wife is basically tragic in its</v>
<v Speaker 4>essence.</v>

1563
01:28:44.410 --> 01:28:48.400
<v Speaker 4>And so life is a difficult word.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you don't carry that burden</v>

1564
01:28:48.401 --> 01:28:51.160
<v Speaker 4>property,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it will make you resentful and that will</v>

1565
01:28:51.161 --> 01:28:55.000
<v Speaker 4>make you cruel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so if you don't want to be resentful</v>

1566
01:28:55.001 --> 01:28:57.400
<v Speaker 4>and cruel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially if you know what that means,</v>

1567
01:28:58.060 --> 01:29:02.400
<v Speaker 4>then you'll do what you can put yourself</v>
<v Speaker 4>together because you'd be a force for</v>

1568
01:29:02.670 --> 01:29:05.790
<v Speaker 4>good rather than evil.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a lot better.</v>

1569
01:29:07.620 --> 01:29:10.830
<v Speaker 4>It's a lot better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's almost no limit to how much</v>

1570
01:29:10.831 --> 01:29:15.630
<v Speaker 4>people can suffer studying to see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is also one of the reasons I</v>

1571
01:29:15.631 --> 01:29:20.310
<v Speaker 4>really like the clinical psychologist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean being a clinical psychologist</v>

1572
01:29:20.370 --> 01:29:25.230
<v Speaker 4>keeps you very much in touch with the</v>
<v Speaker 4>actuality of people's lives and that's</v>

1573
01:29:25.231 --> 01:29:29.430
<v Speaker 4>very unbelievably useful and it's so</v>
<v Speaker 4>useful.</v>

1574
01:29:29.431 --> 01:29:34.431
<v Speaker 4>Like I spend 2025 hours a week every</v>
<v Speaker 4>week helping people walk through their</v>

1575
01:29:36.811 --> 01:29:41.811
<v Speaker 4>most difficult problems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't imagine doing anything more</v>

1576
01:29:43.261 --> 01:29:47.700
<v Speaker 4>possibly useful for informing you will</v>
<v Speaker 4>come out to straighten out your own</v>

1577
01:29:47.701 --> 01:29:48.534
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

1578
01:29:49.830 --> 01:29:50.663
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1579
01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:56.220
<v Speaker 4>it's worth doing it seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These are just oxes locally.</v>

1580
01:29:56.230 --> 01:29:58.450
<v Speaker 4>We've been doing research with the sweep</v>
<v Speaker 4>exercises.</v>

1581
01:29:58.990 --> 01:30:02.080
<v Speaker 4>We used the first,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the future offering on a group of</v>

1582
01:30:02.081 --> 01:30:04.490
<v Speaker 4>students have Miguel Hooper academically</v>
<v Speaker 4>struggling,</v>

1583
01:30:05.390 --> 01:30:07.690
<v Speaker 4>academic probation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there are still a smart,</v>

1584
01:30:07.691 --> 01:30:09.640
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you have to add behind the allocated</v>

1585
01:30:09.670 --> 01:30:12.040
<v Speaker 4>to the gill,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they were failing.</v>

1586
01:30:12.220 --> 01:30:15.750
<v Speaker 4>So we had to go through this program.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We used to have balance control.</v>

1587
01:30:15.850 --> 01:30:19.340
<v Speaker 4>It was a perfect experimental design.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1588
01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:24.600
<v Speaker 4>we raised their grade point average 25%</v>
<v Speaker 4>drop the drop out rate from 30% to zero.</v>

1589
01:30:25.210 --> 01:30:28.330
<v Speaker 4>It's a massive change.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now we've been using the same program,</v>

1590
01:30:28.450 --> 01:30:31.510
<v Speaker 4>the future part of this on a bit at a</v>
<v Speaker 4>business school in,</v>

1591
01:30:31.570 --> 01:30:35.950
<v Speaker 4>in broader now we've used it on two</v>
<v Speaker 4>consecutive cohorts of 800 incoming</v>

1592
01:30:35.951 --> 01:30:40.420
<v Speaker 4>students and we draw their drop rate</v>
<v Speaker 4>from 50% to 30% and raised their grade</v>

1593
01:30:40.421 --> 01:30:45.421
<v Speaker 4>point average 25% and I mean I've used</v>
<v Speaker 4>the future authoring program regularly</v>

1594
01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:48.910
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on people like know,</v>

1595
01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.460
<v Speaker 4>and also apply it to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'll change your life.</v>

1596
01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:55.450
<v Speaker 4>So people very seldom sit down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

1597
01:30:55.451 --> 01:30:57.160
<v Speaker 4>you have to think through who the hell</v>
<v Speaker 4>you are,</v>

1598
01:30:58.070 --> 01:30:59.140
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where you come from,</v>

1599
01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:01.990
<v Speaker 4>how did it shape you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's really useful thing to do if</v>

1600
01:31:01.991 --> 01:31:04.750
<v Speaker 4>you're going to be a clinician,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like psych when else,</v>

1601
01:31:04.751 --> 01:31:06.610
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It kind of gives you a sense of who you</v>

1602
01:31:06.611 --> 01:31:09.130
<v Speaker 4>are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you also have to take some time</v>

1603
01:31:09.131 --> 01:31:11.290
<v Speaker 4>to think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well what do you want from your life?</v>

1604
01:31:11.630 --> 01:31:14.110
<v Speaker 4>Like what sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what sort of features do you want to be</v>

1605
01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:16.390
<v Speaker 4>cause human being.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an amazing thing.</v>

1606
01:31:17.080 --> 01:31:19.180
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like we can be just the most wretched of</v>

1607
01:31:19.181 --> 01:31:22.510
<v Speaker 4>creatures,</v>
<v Speaker 4>murderous and corrupt beyond belief.</v>

1608
01:31:22.590 --> 01:31:24.640
<v Speaker 4>But a person who has their act together</v>
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

1609
01:31:24.641 --> 01:31:28.510
<v Speaker 4>I'm like a force of nature and that's a</v>
<v Speaker 4>lot better.</v>

1610
01:31:28.511 --> 01:31:30.850
<v Speaker 4>So you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well you want to be a force of nature,</v>

1611
01:31:30.970 --> 01:31:32.830
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause you got the opportunity.</v>

1612
01:31:32.831 --> 01:31:34.810
<v Speaker 4>You guys are smart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're young.</v>

1613
01:31:35.110 --> 01:31:36.370
<v Speaker 4>I imagine you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're healthy.</v>

1614
01:31:36.371 --> 01:31:38.620
<v Speaker 4>And also you can at least manage</v>
<v Speaker 4>university.</v>

1615
01:31:38.990 --> 01:31:41.110
<v Speaker 4>It's like what the hell are you waiting</v>
<v Speaker 4>for?</v>

1616
01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:43.600
<v Speaker 4>Hammer yourself together and see what</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can do.</v>

1617
01:31:44.170 --> 01:31:48.400
<v Speaker 4>It's worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Make your life way better.</v>

1618
01:31:51.640 --> 01:31:52.473
<v Speaker 2>I'm</v>

1619
01:31:52.790 --> 01:31:56.840
<v Speaker 4>imagine that would be better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if that's what you want,</v>

1620
01:31:58.540 --> 01:31:59.373
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1621
01:32:00.350 --> 01:32:02.040
<v Speaker 4>it's a good thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's,</v>

1622
01:32:02.041 --> 01:32:04.690
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know any other way that people</v>

1623
01:32:04.691 --> 01:32:06.520
<v Speaker 4>would take it now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sorry.</v>

1624
01:32:06.610 --> 01:32:11.610
<v Speaker 4>I give a lot of agencies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As you step through your life,</v>

1625
01:32:12.410 --> 01:32:15.310
<v Speaker 4>you will see that there are certain</v>
<v Speaker 4>things that sort of call out to you.</v>

1626
01:32:15.311 --> 01:32:18.400
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to grab your attention in</v>
<v Speaker 4>voluntarily,</v>

1627
01:32:19.420 --> 01:32:24.100
<v Speaker 4>and that's a very interesting thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>because people think that there are sort</v>

1628
01:32:24.101 --> 01:32:27.790
<v Speaker 4>of the masters of their own destiny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know that you own you.</v>

1629
01:32:27.880 --> 01:32:30.130
<v Speaker 4>People often will make that argument</v>
<v Speaker 4>about suicide.</v>

1630
01:32:30.131 --> 01:32:31.570
<v Speaker 4>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's my body.</v>

1631
01:32:31.571 --> 01:32:32.950
<v Speaker 4>I can do what I want with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1632
01:32:32.951 --> 01:32:33.784
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

1633
01:32:34.090 --> 01:32:38.350
<v Speaker 4>Neither of those things happen to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>true and if you act it out and you'll</v>

1634
01:32:38.351 --> 01:32:39.620
<v Speaker 4>pay for it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the rent,</v>

1635
01:32:39.621 --> 01:32:41.500
<v Speaker 4>there's reasons it's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not.</v>

1636
01:32:41.501 --> 01:32:46.420
<v Speaker 4>Some arbitrary idea is that you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>governed by forces that you don't</v>

1637
01:32:46.421 --> 01:32:49.360
<v Speaker 4>understand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>knows of the forces the psychoanalysts</v>

1638
01:32:49.480 --> 01:32:50.010
<v Speaker 4>identify.</v>

1639
01:32:50.010 --> 01:32:55.010
<v Speaker 4>It's unconscious and unconscious forces</v>
<v Speaker 4>are the things that make you interested</v>

1640
01:32:56.411 --> 01:32:58.600
<v Speaker 4>in things because you can't control</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1641
01:32:58.610 --> 01:33:01.630
<v Speaker 4>You know that if you're reading some</v>
<v Speaker 4>blood boring paper,</v>

1642
01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:04.570
<v Speaker 4>some other person might find that the</v>
<v Speaker 4>most thrilling thing in the world.</v>

1643
01:33:04.750 --> 01:33:08.850
<v Speaker 4>You can't even concentrate on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'd rather do the dishes or you're</v>

1644
01:33:08.900 --> 01:33:12.060
<v Speaker 4>thinking about the girlfriend you hadn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>grade age or or something,</v>

1645
01:33:12.130 --> 01:33:14.260
<v Speaker 4>your mind wanders,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he can't focus on this.</v>

1646
01:33:14.261 --> 01:33:16.390
<v Speaker 4>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well I have to focus on because there's</v>

1647
01:33:16.391 --> 01:33:18.430
<v Speaker 4>a testimonial.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like your unconscious mind,</v>

1648
01:33:18.431 --> 01:33:19.780
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't care.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1649
01:33:19.870 --> 01:33:23.740
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll go back into the carpenter or or</v>

1650
01:33:23.741 --> 01:33:26.680
<v Speaker 4>clean out underneath cleaning the dust</v>
<v Speaker 4>bunnies out from underneath the bed,</v>

1651
01:33:26.681 --> 01:33:30.250
<v Speaker 4>anything but read this paper and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>there'll be another paper that's twice</v>

1652
01:33:30.251 --> 01:33:34.360
<v Speaker 4>as difficult and you're compelled by it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll just stick to it like glue and if</v>

1653
01:33:34.390 --> 01:33:36.790
<v Speaker 4>you'll remember it right away and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>think,</v>

1654
01:33:36.820 --> 01:33:37.690
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why is that?</v>

1655
01:33:37.690 --> 01:33:41.260
<v Speaker 4>Why can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why is the one thing so easy for you to</v>

1656
01:33:41.261 --> 01:33:44.500
<v Speaker 4>get other things so difficult and even</v>
<v Speaker 4>worst whitehead in choose.</v>

1657
01:33:45.310 --> 01:33:47.200
<v Speaker 4>That's a strange thing because you</v>
<v Speaker 4>think,</v>

1658
01:33:47.201 --> 01:33:48.700
<v Speaker 4>well if you were in control you just</v>
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>

1659
01:33:48.730 --> 01:33:52.240
<v Speaker 4>well I'm going to be interested in this</v>
<v Speaker 4>paper and well good luck with that.</v>

1660
01:33:52.570 --> 01:33:55.130
<v Speaker 4>And so it is new.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Decided what we were interested with</v>

1661
01:33:55.520 --> 01:33:57.100
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you go to ask yourself,</v>

1662
01:33:58.030 --> 01:34:01.330
<v Speaker 4>what the hell is it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when you start asking yourself that</v>

1663
01:34:01.331 --> 01:34:02.980
<v Speaker 4>question,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's when you start to become a</v>

1664
01:34:02.981 --> 01:34:06.190
<v Speaker 4>clinical psychologist because that's a</v>
<v Speaker 4>hell of a question.</v>

1665
01:34:06.730 --> 01:34:08.470
<v Speaker 4>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in terms of motivation,</v>

1666
01:34:08.471 --> 01:34:11.290
<v Speaker 4>one of the things you can learn is to</v>
<v Speaker 4>how is,</v>

1667
01:34:11.291 --> 01:34:14.290
<v Speaker 4>how to follow those things that compel</v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

1668
01:34:15.670 --> 01:34:18.610
<v Speaker 4>And you have to be careful when you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing that because you also have to,</v>

1669
01:34:18.850 --> 01:34:22.960
<v Speaker 4>you have to balance that with the</v>
<v Speaker 4>certain degree of honesty because if</v>

1670
01:34:22.961 --> 01:34:27.430
<v Speaker 4>you're dishonest and deceitful video,</v>
<v Speaker 4>corrupt the workings of your neural</v>

1671
01:34:27.431 --> 01:34:31.630
<v Speaker 4>mechanisms and then the light would be</v>
<v Speaker 4>shining from places you don't want it to</v>

1672
01:34:31.631 --> 01:34:34.480
<v Speaker 4>shrink from.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you're going to pursue the things</v>

1673
01:34:34.481 --> 01:34:37.120
<v Speaker 4>that compel you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which you can do,</v>

1674
01:34:37.121 --> 01:34:38.830
<v Speaker 4>which I think is a very good thing to</v>
<v Speaker 4>do,</v>

1675
01:34:38.831 --> 01:34:43.320
<v Speaker 4>that's a quest by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You also have to straight yourself only</v>

1676
01:34:43.330 --> 01:34:45.640
<v Speaker 4>ethically because otherwise you will end</v>
<v Speaker 4>up taking some,</v>

1677
01:34:46.060 --> 01:34:49.990
<v Speaker 4>some bad terms and you can get</v>
<v Speaker 4>ridiculously motivated if you do that</v>

1678
01:34:49.991 --> 01:34:53.020
<v Speaker 4>because you'll end up living in a world</v>
<v Speaker 4>where everything is so interesting to</v>

1679
01:34:53.021 --> 01:34:56.670
<v Speaker 4>you all the time that you can hardly</v>
<v Speaker 4>stand and know</v>

1680
01:34:59.090 --> 01:35:02.090
<v Speaker 3>that's a good place to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1681
01:35:05.540 --> 01:35:06.670
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just wondering.</v>

1682
01:35:12.530 --> 01:35:17.530
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just some degree on what you do with it,</v>

1683
01:35:18.291 --> 01:35:21.390
<v Speaker 4>but I think it's a good idea actually.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1684
01:35:21.410 --> 01:35:25.490
<v Speaker 4>and if you could,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you could make use of the time and so</v>

1685
01:35:25.491 --> 01:35:29.900
<v Speaker 4>you have to decide is do you have</v>
<v Speaker 4>something to do with during that year is</v>

1686
01:35:29.930 --> 01:35:33.170
<v Speaker 4>productive and that will further your</v>
<v Speaker 4>development that will make you more</v>

1687
01:35:33.171 --> 01:35:34.610
<v Speaker 4>mature.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That would be the best thing.</v>

1688
01:35:34.700 --> 01:35:39.700
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If</v>

1689
01:35:43.590 --> 01:35:44.610
<v Speaker 3>you want it to do,</v>

1690
01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:50.811
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1691
01:35:50.811 --> 01:35:53.320
<v Speaker 4>no you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You remember it look like anybody you</v>

1692
01:35:53.321 --> 01:35:57.520
<v Speaker 4>want to work with is going to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>reasonably sensible because unless you</v>

1693
01:35:57.521 --> 01:36:01.570
<v Speaker 4>want to work with someone who isn't and</v>
<v Speaker 4>anybody who's reasonably since sensible</v>

1694
01:36:01.571 --> 01:36:02.510
<v Speaker 4>is going to think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well you know,</v>

1695
01:36:02.511 --> 01:36:04.960
<v Speaker 4>this person's young,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they should go kick around a little bit.</v>

1696
01:36:06.050 --> 01:36:08.830
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe one of the problems with a place</v>

1697
01:36:08.831 --> 01:36:10.450
<v Speaker 4>like the University of Toronto for</v>
<v Speaker 4>example,</v>

1698
01:36:10.451 --> 01:36:12.250
<v Speaker 4>is it Lord for the students here like at</v>
<v Speaker 4>home for their home</v>

1699
01:36:12.430 --> 01:36:13.960
<v Speaker 3>undergraduate career.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1700
01:36:13.980 --> 01:36:16.170
<v Speaker 3>well that's not preparation for graduate</v>
<v Speaker 3>school.</v>

1701
01:36:16.780 --> 01:36:17.613
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1702
01:36:17.890 --> 01:36:22.030
<v Speaker 4>if it will foster your independence and</v>
<v Speaker 4>make you more disciplined and broaden</v>

1703
01:36:22.031 --> 01:36:26.520
<v Speaker 4>your experience,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no one with any sense.</v>

1704
01:36:26.521 --> 01:36:28.440
<v Speaker 4>It's been a look on that as anything</v>
<v Speaker 4>positive.</v>

1705
01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:37.990
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say that again.</v>

1706
01:36:43.200 --> 01:36:44.750
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're going to go to medicine,</v>

1707
01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:46.710
<v Speaker 4>medical school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've probably pursue a career in</v>

1708
01:36:46.711 --> 01:36:48.840
<v Speaker 4>psychiatry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1709
01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:52.470
<v Speaker 4>And the difference between a</v>
<v Speaker 4>psychiatrist and a psychologist is that,</v>

1710
01:36:53.010 --> 01:36:57.420
<v Speaker 4>well the psychiatrist is an MD</v>
<v Speaker 4>psychiatrist can and does prescribe</v>

1711
01:36:57.421 --> 01:36:59.640
<v Speaker 4>drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's nothing wrong with that,</v>

1712
01:36:59.641 --> 01:37:01.530
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're a clinical psychologist and</v>

1713
01:37:01.531 --> 01:37:04.770
<v Speaker 4>somebody comes to see you when they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>like suicidally depressed,</v>

1714
01:37:04.830 --> 01:37:06.840
<v Speaker 4>what do you tell them as well?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1715
01:37:06.900 --> 01:37:09.630
<v Speaker 4>we're not gonna make a lot of progress</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you kind of risks in the next two</v>

1716
01:37:09.631 --> 01:37:11.280
<v Speaker 4>weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you might want to think about taking</v>

1717
01:37:11.281 --> 01:37:13.610
<v Speaker 4>some antidepressants so you've got no</v>
<v Speaker 4>energy.</v>

1718
01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:14.760
<v Speaker 4>Put your life back together.</v>

1719
01:37:15.090 --> 01:37:17.370
<v Speaker 3>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to be</v>

1720
01:37:19.050 --> 01:37:21.110
<v Speaker 4>dogmatic about any of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1721
01:37:21.460 --> 01:37:24.510
<v Speaker 4>so drug therapies could be extremely</v>
<v Speaker 4>useful.</v>

1722
01:37:24.540 --> 01:37:27.810
<v Speaker 4>But generally if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you take the medical group,</v>

1723
01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:32.960
<v Speaker 4>you become a psychiatrist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well you can't prescribe directly,</v>

1724
01:37:37.511 --> 01:37:40.260
<v Speaker 4>but that doesn't really matter because</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll learn enough about</v>

1725
01:37:40.270 --> 01:37:43.150
<v Speaker 4>pharmacotherapy in graduate school.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I've know what I need with my</v>

1726
01:37:43.151 --> 01:37:44.890
<v Speaker 4>clients.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just write them a letter to take to</v>

1727
01:37:44.891 --> 01:37:45.724
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

1728
01:37:46.620 --> 01:37:47.850
<v Speaker 3>Generally the GP,</v>

1729
01:37:49.510 --> 01:37:52.180
<v Speaker 4>so you'll know you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll learn what the basic</v>

1730
01:37:52.181 --> 01:37:56.310
<v Speaker 4>antidepressants are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those will be drugs you use most often.</v>

1731
01:37:56.570 --> 01:38:00.360
<v Speaker 4>Do you recommend most often because are</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're blogging he affected or most</v>

1732
01:38:00.810 --> 01:38:05.810
<v Speaker 4>conditions that involve excess negative</v>
<v Speaker 4>emotion now and then somebody will need</v>

1733
01:38:06.371 --> 01:38:09.460
<v Speaker 4>an antibiotic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're a clinical psychologist with a</v>

1734
01:38:09.461 --> 01:38:11.320
<v Speaker 4>private practice that won't happen very</v>
<v Speaker 4>often.</v>

1735
01:38:12.400 --> 01:38:13.860
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1736
01:38:14.500 --> 01:38:19.500
<v Speaker 4>medical schools a long haul.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you're interested in primarily in</v>

1737
01:38:20.531 --> 01:38:23.980
<v Speaker 4>working with people in a problem solving</v>
<v Speaker 4>capacity,</v>

1738
01:38:24.580 --> 01:38:26.920
<v Speaker 4>it could be the clinical psychology is a</v>
<v Speaker 4>better choice.</v>

1739
01:38:26.921 --> 01:38:28.780
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you might be medically oriented.</v>

1740
01:38:28.781 --> 01:38:30.900
<v Speaker 4>Lots of people are medically oriented</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if,</v>

1741
01:38:31.120 --> 01:38:32.740
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if the more,</v>

1742
01:38:33.860 --> 01:38:36.580
<v Speaker 4>if the more physiological element of</v>
<v Speaker 4>care,</v>

1743
01:38:36.760 --> 01:38:40.690
<v Speaker 4>Pos q and medical schools a good option.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some people do both.</v>

1744
01:38:41.910 --> 01:38:43.660
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to talk about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

1745
01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:45.460
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some people do both.</v>

1746
01:38:52.410 --> 01:38:53.410
<v Speaker 3>It'd be focusing on,</v>

1747
01:38:53.830 --> 01:38:55.630
<v Speaker 4>you mean for first year of graduate</v>
<v Speaker 4>school?</v>

1748
01:38:58.360 --> 01:39:03.360
<v Speaker 4>First year undergraduate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well what you should really give it your</v>

1749
01:39:03.431 --> 01:39:05.560
<v Speaker 4>first year as an undergraduate because</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should,</v>

1750
01:39:05.950 --> 01:39:08.350
<v Speaker 4>you should,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should take a wide variety of</v>

1751
01:39:08.351 --> 01:39:11.800
<v Speaker 4>courses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You should sort of find out what you</v>

1752
01:39:11.801 --> 01:39:16.150
<v Speaker 4>might be interested in it and you should</v>
<v Speaker 4>learn to learn to work and learn to</v>

1753
01:39:16.151 --> 01:39:19.360
<v Speaker 4>socialize because those things are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1754
01:39:19.390 --> 01:39:22.480
<v Speaker 4>the things that make people successful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I talked about two of them,</v>

1755
01:39:22.481 --> 01:39:23.980
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Intelligence,</v>

1756
01:39:24.370 --> 01:39:27.670
<v Speaker 4>conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's discipline creativities and other</v>

1757
01:39:27.671 --> 01:39:29.320
<v Speaker 4>ones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's pretty hard to develop if you</v>

1758
01:39:29.321 --> 01:39:32.200
<v Speaker 4>don't already have one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the fourth thing that makes people</v>

1759
01:39:32.201 --> 01:39:34.900
<v Speaker 4>successful across time is Bradford</v>
<v Speaker 4>social network.</v>

1760
01:39:35.560 --> 01:39:39.070
<v Speaker 4>And so learning to socialize and to</v>
<v Speaker 4>develop a large connection,</v>

1761
01:39:39.480 --> 01:39:42.010
<v Speaker 4>large social connection,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's unbelievably useful.</v>

1762
01:39:42.011 --> 01:39:44.240
<v Speaker 4>So you should get good at those when</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're in your first year,</v>

1763
01:39:44.890 --> 01:39:46.120
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that statue pretty.</v>

1764
01:39:46.270 --> 01:39:49.300
<v Speaker 4>So if you come out of your first year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're still in university,</v>

1765
01:39:49.420 --> 01:39:50.141
<v Speaker 4>you got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1766
01:39:50.141 --> 01:39:52.670
<v Speaker 4>five courses under your belt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Doug decently,</v>

1767
01:39:52.671 --> 01:39:56.230
<v Speaker 4>you have a circle of friends.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He started sort of start to establish</v>

1768
01:39:56.470 --> 01:39:59.120
<v Speaker 4>what you might be interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good.</v>

1769
01:39:59.340 --> 01:40:00.280
<v Speaker 4>And I was successful.</v>

1770
01:40:00.860 --> 01:40:02.730
<v Speaker 3>What do you think is the time that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>bought to the site?</v>

1771
01:40:05.080 --> 01:40:06.550
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the first thing I would say is it's</v>

1772
01:40:06.551 --> 01:40:08.410
<v Speaker 4>always better to do something than</v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing.</v>

1773
01:40:09.250 --> 01:40:14.140
<v Speaker 4>So don't wait around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what I mean by that practically is</v>

1774
01:40:14.890 --> 01:40:19.540
<v Speaker 4>if you're not sure what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>taking casts and do that and do it hard.</v>

1775
01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:22.780
<v Speaker 4>And as you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll learn what's good above what</v>

1776
01:40:22.781 --> 01:40:24.880
<v Speaker 4>isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then in somewhere down the road,</v>

1777
01:40:24.881 --> 01:40:27.010
<v Speaker 4>six months to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and be in a better position to figure</v>

1778
01:40:27.011 --> 01:40:29.320
<v Speaker 4>out what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you keep doing that,</v>

1779
01:40:29.710 --> 01:40:31.990
<v Speaker 4>sooner or later you'll figure out</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly what you want.</v>

1780
01:40:32.500 --> 01:40:36.700
<v Speaker 4>But don't wait around waiting is you</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't learn anything when you were</v>

1781
01:40:36.701 --> 01:40:39.400
<v Speaker 4>lingual way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's better to go off and try things</v>

1782
01:40:39.670 --> 01:40:42.940
<v Speaker 4>and to try too hard because then you</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually inform yourself.</v>

1783
01:40:43.510 --> 01:40:45.070
<v Speaker 4>And other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no real rule.</v>

1784
01:40:45.071 --> 01:40:50.071
<v Speaker 4>It takes people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it takes people of varying amounts of</v>

1785
01:40:51.191 --> 01:40:55.060
<v Speaker 4>time to establish an identity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If don't have a well capitalized on,</v>

1786
01:40:55.061 --> 01:40:58.720
<v Speaker 4>you have to be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the time you're 30 you're starting</v>

1787
01:40:58.721 --> 01:41:00.760
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it started to not be good.</v>

1788
01:41:01.540 --> 01:41:04.930
<v Speaker 4>And if it's really not there were still</v>
<v Speaker 4>by 40</v>

1789
01:41:07.030 --> 01:41:10.720
<v Speaker 4>that's really not so good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you're confused,</v>

1790
01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:16.200
<v Speaker 4>get some credentials,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to have something to show for</v>

1791
01:41:17.951 --> 01:41:21.250
<v Speaker 4>your effort.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you pay attention and you focus</v>

1792
01:41:21.251 --> 01:41:22.350
<v Speaker 4>and you work hard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll figure it out.</v>

1793
01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:22.600
<v Speaker 4>But</v>

1794
01:41:22.600 --> 01:41:23.433
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1795
01:41:25.140 --> 01:41:25.651
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>

1796
01:41:25.651 --> 01:41:29.250
<v Speaker 4>but as I said before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the best thing to do to begin with this,</v>

1797
01:41:29.510 --> 01:41:33.480
<v Speaker 4>you want to see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you may not know this,</v>

1798
01:41:33.510 --> 01:41:37.110
<v Speaker 4>but the schools that you attended before</v>
<v Speaker 4>you went to university,</v>

1799
01:41:37.710 --> 01:41:42.390
<v Speaker 4>they were establishing their basic</v>
<v Speaker 4>structure was established in the late 18</v>

1800
01:41:42.391 --> 01:41:47.391
<v Speaker 4>hundreds and they were originally set up</v>
<v Speaker 4>to teach the children and factory</v>

1801
01:41:47.791 --> 01:41:51.750
<v Speaker 4>workers to be factory workers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their factories.</v>

1802
01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:55.650
<v Speaker 4>You can tell just by looking at them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even this to some degree,</v>

1803
01:41:55.651 --> 01:41:58.290
<v Speaker 4>it's still the factory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the wrong model.</v>

1804
01:41:59.400 --> 01:42:02.790
<v Speaker 4>Probably factories is you're not going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to work in a bloody factor.</v>

1805
01:42:03.570 --> 01:42:06.480
<v Speaker 4>You're going to have a career.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And to have occur,</v>

1806
01:42:06.570 --> 01:42:09.000
<v Speaker 4>you have to figure out who you want to</v>
<v Speaker 4>be.</v>

1807
01:42:09.990 --> 01:42:14.310
<v Speaker 4>And so one of the things you want to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing over the next while is getting,</v>

1808
01:42:14.430 --> 01:42:18.600
<v Speaker 4>this is why I have a liberal arts</v>
<v Speaker 4>education is so useful because a liberal</v>

1809
01:42:18.601 --> 01:42:23.601
<v Speaker 4>arts education helps teach you what a</v>
<v Speaker 4>person could be and that's not the same</v>

1810
01:42:24.451 --> 01:42:25.270
<v Speaker 4>as getting a job.</v>

1811
01:42:25.270 --> 01:42:29.640
<v Speaker 4>And the university is not for getting a</v>
<v Speaker 4>job universities for figuring out what</v>

1812
01:42:29.641 --> 01:42:34.530
<v Speaker 4>sort of person you could be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so it's also useful to take</v>

1813
01:42:34.531 --> 01:42:37.590
<v Speaker 4>philosophy courses and to take</v>
<v Speaker 4>literature courses and to broaden</v>

1814
01:42:37.591 --> 01:42:42.480
<v Speaker 4>yourself so that you get a a better idea</v>
<v Speaker 4>of what the difference is between a</v>

1815
01:42:42.481 --> 01:42:45.150
<v Speaker 4>great person and the and the trivial</v>
<v Speaker 4>person.</v>

1816
01:42:45.690 --> 01:42:47.460
<v Speaker 4>And then me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's not a very modern idea</v>

1817
01:42:47.461 --> 01:42:50.820
<v Speaker 4>because we'd like to think that all</v>
<v Speaker 4>people are the same and that's that's if</v>

1818
01:42:50.821 --> 01:42:52.890
<v Speaker 4>all people aren't the same,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he must have just stopped doing what</v>

1819
01:42:52.891 --> 01:42:56.010
<v Speaker 4>you're doing right now because you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>the as the same as you're ever going to</v>

1820
01:42:56.011 --> 01:42:59.190
<v Speaker 4>get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If there's differences in quality,</v>

1821
01:42:59.200 --> 01:43:03.540
<v Speaker 4>then you should infer what's high</v>
<v Speaker 4>quality and then you should also know</v>

1822
01:43:03.541 --> 01:43:06.240
<v Speaker 4>what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so if your first year you wouldn't</v>

1823
01:43:06.330 --> 01:43:11.240
<v Speaker 4>get helps to to do some thinking and to</v>
<v Speaker 4>be guided by people who the culture of</v>

1824
01:43:11.241 --> 01:43:15.720
<v Speaker 4>recognizes as great thinkers because</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've thought about what it means to</v>

1825
01:43:15.721 --> 01:43:20.610
<v Speaker 4>be human and why that matters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you might as well aim as high</v>

1826
01:43:20.611 --> 01:43:24.480
<v Speaker 4>as you can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hae not be a good thing to start sorting</v>

1827
01:43:24.481 --> 01:43:26.130
<v Speaker 4>out the first couple of years</v>
<v Speaker 4>university.</v>

1828
01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:31.610
<v Speaker 2>So</v>
<v Speaker 2>graduate programs,</v>

1829
01:43:31.760 --> 01:43:36.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure I should go straight or</v>
<v Speaker 2>right off for ask as well.</v>

1830
01:43:37.500 --> 01:43:40.200
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Masters are useless.</v>

1831
01:43:42.150 --> 01:43:43.530
<v Speaker 4>I mean for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for</v>

1832
01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:47.100
<v Speaker 4>most places,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for clinically,</v>

1833
01:43:47.130 --> 01:43:49.770
<v Speaker 4>most places you can't practice with the</v>
<v Speaker 4>master's degree anymore.</v>

1834
01:43:49.771 --> 01:43:53.900
<v Speaker 4>In most programs have the masters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you could still practice in</v>

1835
01:43:53.901 --> 01:43:56.360
<v Speaker 4>Elbert radicle bet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm not even sure about that</v>

1836
01:43:56.420 --> 01:44:00.550
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For an academic career generally maybe</v>

1837
01:44:00.570 --> 01:44:02.990
<v Speaker 4>depends on why you want to take the</v>
<v Speaker 4>extra education.</v>

1838
01:44:03.020 --> 01:44:05.660
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're going to go into business or</v>

1839
01:44:05.661 --> 01:44:08.870
<v Speaker 4>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a master's degree might help you.</v>

1840
01:44:10.280 --> 01:44:15.090
<v Speaker 4>But if you're after the academic career,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a phd is you want,</v>

1841
01:44:15.620 --> 01:44:18.200
<v Speaker 4>and then it probably doesn't matter</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether you take a program that has a</v>

1842
01:44:18.201 --> 01:44:19.950
<v Speaker 4>master's Mphd or just each,</v>

1843
01:44:23.350 --> 01:44:28.350
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1844
01:44:34.420 --> 01:44:35.750
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what about,</v>

1845
01:44:39.980 --> 01:44:40.701
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm less,</v>

1846
01:44:40.701 --> 01:44:43.010
<v Speaker 4>I'm less informed about those sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 4>status.</v>

1847
01:44:43.340 --> 01:44:46.550
<v Speaker 4>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as long as you can practice with the</v>

1848
01:44:46.551 --> 01:44:49.220
<v Speaker 4>master's degree,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then that's no problem.</v>

1849
01:44:49.221 --> 01:44:54.221
<v Speaker 4>But if you know</v>
<v Speaker 4>that that's a different career path to</v>

1850
01:44:54.421 --> 01:44:58.640
<v Speaker 4>be not as sometimes put you in as a</v>
<v Speaker 4>school counselor or something like that,</v>

1851
01:44:58.940 --> 01:45:01.790
<v Speaker 4>and that's perfectly fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the patient choice.</v>

1852
01:45:02.090 --> 01:45:05.370
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I won't say in some ways it's a,</v>

1853
01:45:05.640 --> 01:45:09.980
<v Speaker 4>it's a more defined in less demanding</v>
<v Speaker 4>life and that can be,</v>

1854
01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:13.020
<v Speaker 4>that can be extremely useful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1855
01:45:13.021 --> 01:45:16.760
<v Speaker 4>what an academic career or something or</v>
<v Speaker 4>a career like that.</v>

1856
01:45:16.940 --> 01:45:21.560
<v Speaker 4>It's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of all consuming and that</v>

1857
01:45:21.561 --> 01:45:25.430
<v Speaker 4>isn't necessarily for everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It certainly isn't forever.</v>

1858
01:45:25.970 --> 01:45:28.160
<v Speaker 4>And it should.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it should be for everyone.</v>

1859
01:45:28.400 --> 01:45:30.120
<v Speaker 4>You have to be compelled in that</v>
<v Speaker 4>direction.</v>

1860
01:45:30.260 --> 01:45:35.260
<v Speaker 4>It be the choice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know you'd have to be more specific in</v>

1861
01:45:44.221 --> 01:45:46.110
<v Speaker 4>the question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know exactly what you're asking.</v>

1862
01:45:49.320 --> 01:45:50.153
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1863
01:45:56.310 --> 01:46:00.460
<v Speaker 4>The best of your best bet is to contact</v>
<v Speaker 4>the college and find out what their</v>

1864
01:46:00.461 --> 01:46:05.010
<v Speaker 4>registration.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good luck with that because their</v>

1865
01:46:05.011 --> 01:46:08.320
<v Speaker 4>registration rules are pretty vague and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's hard to pin down,</v>

1866
01:46:08.350 --> 01:46:11.680
<v Speaker 4>but that is what you should do to</v>
<v Speaker 4>protect yourself and you should get it</v>

1867
01:46:11.681 --> 01:46:16.540
<v Speaker 4>in writing because it's all on the phone</v>
<v Speaker 4>that that's nothing.</v>

1868
01:46:17.140 --> 01:46:19.590
<v Speaker 4>You need to get it and run it and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>can't really,</v>

1869
01:46:19.690 --> 01:46:22.300
<v Speaker 4>I can't really give you any more</v>
<v Speaker 4>specific information than that.</v>

1870
01:46:26.850 --> 01:46:31.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1871
01:46:38.060 --> 01:46:41.830
<v Speaker 4>I can't tell you a lot about that</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I looked beside the hold.</v>

1872
01:46:41.831 --> 01:46:45.290
<v Speaker 4>The whole side of the street is outside</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the academic street.</v>

1873
01:46:45.620 --> 01:46:49.220
<v Speaker 4>They're professional schools.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're mostly set up in the US.</v>

1874
01:46:49.290 --> 01:46:53.820
<v Speaker 4>They take a large number of students</v>
<v Speaker 4>feeding the acceptance criteria of much</v>

1875
01:46:53.821 --> 01:46:57.150
<v Speaker 4>lower,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the price you paid for that is the</v>

1876
01:46:57.151 --> 01:46:59.070
<v Speaker 4>incredibly high tuition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'll,</v>

1877
01:46:59.080 --> 01:47:03.780
<v Speaker 4>he'll walk up by $200,000 debt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now that might be okay.</v>

1878
01:47:03.930 --> 01:47:07.110
<v Speaker 4>You might get to pay that off because</v>
<v Speaker 4>you being included,</v>

1879
01:47:07.480 --> 01:47:09.660
<v Speaker 4>local mission can be relatively</v>
<v Speaker 4>lucrative.</v>

1880
01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:13.650
<v Speaker 4>Typical hourly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The rate is maybe first beginner is</v>

1881
01:47:13.651 --> 01:47:18.651
<v Speaker 4>maybe to get your practice going and be</v>
<v Speaker 4>perhaps 102 hundred $25 an hour,</v>

1882
01:47:19.770 --> 01:47:23.840
<v Speaker 4>and then that can go all the way up to</v>
<v Speaker 4>the $8,300 an hour.</v>

1883
01:47:23.841 --> 01:47:25.110
<v Speaker 4>Oh Ho.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's uncommon.</v>

1884
01:47:25.170 --> 01:47:30.170
<v Speaker 4>One 75 was probably more typical.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so if you see six clients a day,</v>

1885
01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:34.170
<v Speaker 4>let's say five,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's $1,000 a day.</v>

1886
01:47:34.650 --> 01:47:39.650
<v Speaker 4>So it's about $250,000 a year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you can pay off for $200,000 debt</v>

1887
01:47:39.760 --> 01:47:42.090
<v Speaker 4>pretty fast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

1888
01:47:42.120 --> 01:47:45.090
<v Speaker 4>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you set up a successful clinical</v>

1889
01:47:45.091 --> 01:47:48.800
<v Speaker 4>career afterwards and there is quite a</v>
<v Speaker 4>financial or a clinical psychologist,</v>

1890
01:47:48.960 --> 01:47:52.680
<v Speaker 4>there's no glut on the market,</v>
<v Speaker 4>although people have to pay you</v>

1891
01:47:52.681 --> 01:47:55.430
<v Speaker 4>privately or through the insurance</v>
<v Speaker 4>companies because it's not an old hip</v>

1892
01:47:55.440 --> 01:47:56.273
<v Speaker 4>service.</v>

1893
01:48:08.230 --> 01:48:10.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well there's only about 40 large</v>

1894
01:48:10.241 --> 01:48:13.660
<v Speaker 4>research institutions in North America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can find them on the web,</v>

1895
01:48:13.930 --> 01:48:16.020
<v Speaker 4>they're the ones you already may know</v>
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>

1896
01:48:16.060 --> 01:48:21.060
<v Speaker 4>And then there was a sprinkling of</v>
<v Speaker 4>smaller institutions and their emphasis</v>

1897
01:48:21.161 --> 01:48:24.040
<v Speaker 4>on research productivity is a lot less,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or they're not,</v>

1898
01:48:24.340 --> 01:48:29.170
<v Speaker 4>they're not as competitive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you could attend those places to get</v>

1899
01:48:29.171 --> 01:48:33.370
<v Speaker 4>a decent training as a scientific</v>
<v Speaker 4>thinker at the same time that you</v>

1900
01:48:33.550 --> 01:48:37.930
<v Speaker 4>acquire your clinic license.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's perfectly reasonable thing to do.</v>

1901
01:48:38.740 --> 01:48:42.230
<v Speaker 4>So that's why at the beginning I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1902
01:48:42.380 --> 01:48:46.390
<v Speaker 4>I brought them because there's a big</v>
<v Speaker 4>difference.</v>

1903
01:48:46.660 --> 01:48:50.170
<v Speaker 4>There's some difference between</v>
<v Speaker 4>universities and the differences on</v>

1904
01:48:50.200 --> 01:48:52.090
<v Speaker 4>trivial,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there was a massive difference</v>

1905
01:48:52.091 --> 01:48:54.210
<v Speaker 4>between being at a university and not</v>
<v Speaker 4>meeting.</v>

1906
01:48:54.220 --> 01:48:56.740
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you have the</v>

1907
01:48:58.390 --> 01:49:02.920
<v Speaker 4>privilege of being able to choose which</v>
<v Speaker 4>university you're going to go too well,</v>

1908
01:49:02.921 --> 01:49:03.400
<v Speaker 4>great.</v>

1909
01:49:03.400 --> 01:49:06.640
<v Speaker 4>But you don't want to sacrifice the</v>
<v Speaker 4>binary choice,</v>

1910
01:49:07.650 --> 01:49:09.400
<v Speaker 4>the pause,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the binary choice just to</v>

1911
01:49:11.740 --> 01:49:14.620
<v Speaker 4>fiddle around with the Diet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1912
01:49:14.621 --> 01:49:16.120
<v Speaker 4>so I'm going to close,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry,</v>

1913
01:49:16.450 --> 01:49:18.290
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going to get a very quick</v>
<v Speaker 4>overview.</v>

1914
01:49:18.310 --> 01:49:20.930
<v Speaker 4>So here's what you did do as a</v>
<v Speaker 4>psychologist,</v>

1915
01:49:21.760 --> 01:49:25.300
<v Speaker 4>you're that if you're an experimental</v>
<v Speaker 4>psychologist,</v>

1916
01:49:25.810 --> 01:49:29.050
<v Speaker 4>generally you're heading for an academic</v>
<v Speaker 4>career.</v>

1917
01:49:29.320 --> 01:49:32.980
<v Speaker 4>However,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are opportunities and research</v>

1918
01:49:33.070 --> 01:49:37.720
<v Speaker 4>enterprises outside of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So in businesses for example,</v>

1919
01:49:38.890 --> 01:49:42.310
<v Speaker 4>also the activity market for a</v>
<v Speaker 4>psychologist is really opening up</v>

1920
01:49:42.311 --> 01:49:46.490
<v Speaker 4>because psychologists are increasingly</v>
<v Speaker 4>being hired at economics departments and</v>

1921
01:49:46.510 --> 01:49:51.510
<v Speaker 4>business.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And as a junior professor at a psych</v>

1922
01:49:51.731 --> 01:49:54.250
<v Speaker 4>department,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you start with the [inaudible] at the</v>

1923
01:49:54.251 --> 01:49:56.920
<v Speaker 4>business school.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's start with the selling of up to 50</v>

1924
01:49:57.570 --> 01:50:00.910
<v Speaker 4>so business schools are having</v>
<v Speaker 4>psychologists because they're figuring</v>

1925
01:50:00.911 --> 01:50:02.560
<v Speaker 4>out that we know what we're talking</v>
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>

1926
01:50:02.920 --> 01:50:07.210
<v Speaker 4>Whereas Business Phds and economists and</v>
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>

1927
01:50:07.330 --> 01:50:10.420
<v Speaker 4>not usually because their models of</v>
<v Speaker 4>human beings are wronged and they don't</v>

1928
01:50:10.421 --> 01:50:11.830
<v Speaker 4>know their statistics very well.</v>

1929
01:50:12.070 --> 01:50:15.130
<v Speaker 4>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the athletic opportunities for</v>

1930
01:50:15.131 --> 01:50:19.390
<v Speaker 4>experiment with a phd or Spanish,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a good time to be a psychologist.</v>

1931
01:50:19.750 --> 01:50:23.650
<v Speaker 4>So it's relatively hard to get it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when you're in,</v>

1932
01:50:23.651 --> 01:50:26.710
<v Speaker 4>you better be productive because you</v>
<v Speaker 4>won't be a credible candidate if you're</v>

1933
01:50:26.711 --> 01:50:28.180
<v Speaker 4>not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you've got to get disciplined.</v>

1934
01:50:28.181 --> 01:50:31.550
<v Speaker 4>On the clinical side,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's almost nothing more valuable</v>

1935
01:50:31.551 --> 01:50:34.900
<v Speaker 4>than a clinical degree because you can</v>
<v Speaker 4>work as a clinician,</v>

1936
01:50:35.950 --> 01:50:39.730
<v Speaker 4>can work in a hospital,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can work in academia and you can</v>

1937
01:50:39.731 --> 01:50:43.840
<v Speaker 4>work as a consultant or you can do any</v>
<v Speaker 4>combination of those things.</v>

1938
01:50:43.841 --> 01:50:47.230
<v Speaker 4>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have a vast range of possibilities</v>

1939
01:50:47.231 --> 01:50:50.230
<v Speaker 4>open up for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you have a clinical phd,</v>

1940
01:50:50.410 --> 01:50:54.040
<v Speaker 4>it takes a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a six year phd and the new few</v>

1941
01:50:54.040 --> 01:50:58.330
<v Speaker 4>years of training after that and it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>hard to get in and when you're in it's</v>

1942
01:50:58.331 --> 01:50:59.800
<v Speaker 4>competitive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you have to work,</v>

1943
01:50:59.801 --> 01:51:04.360
<v Speaker 4>but if you can pull it off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it sets you up for a vast range of</v>

1944
01:51:04.361 --> 01:51:08.170
<v Speaker 4>possibilities in your future now and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then</v>

1945
01:51:09.820 --> 01:51:12.910
<v Speaker 4>to conclude that personally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you want to set yourself up for this</v>

1946
01:51:12.911 --> 01:51:17.911
<v Speaker 4>sort of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>learn not to waste time because that's</v>

1947
01:51:18.401 --> 01:51:21.190
<v Speaker 4>the one thing you can do that sort of</v>
<v Speaker 4>under your control that will make you</v>

1948
01:51:21.191 --> 01:51:23.530
<v Speaker 4>more competitive and start to take a</v>
<v Speaker 4>boat.</v>

1949
01:51:23.920 --> 01:51:27.280
<v Speaker 4>They hard about how you want your life</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be and how you don't want it to be</v>

1950
01:51:27.281 --> 01:51:31.030
<v Speaker 4>because that can increase your</v>
<v Speaker 4>motivation to do things properly.</v>

1951
01:51:31.630 --> 01:51:35.110
<v Speaker 4>So</v>
<v Speaker 4>all take,</v>

1952
01:51:35.111 --> 01:51:37.170
<v Speaker 4>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then there's another question that you'd</v>

1953
01:51:37.171 --> 01:51:38.880
<v Speaker 4>like to think that then we should</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably stop.</v>

1954
01:51:38.900 --> 01:51:41.040
<v Speaker 4>So it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anybody have a question that hasn't been</v>

1955
01:51:41.060 --> 01:51:42.210
<v Speaker 4>your sds?</v>

1956
01:51:47.970 --> 01:51:51.010
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't.</v>

1957
01:51:51.130 --> 01:51:56.050
<v Speaker 4>Here's what you have to realize.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not your suffering.</v>

1958
01:51:56.710 --> 01:52:01.540
<v Speaker 4>You have your own suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your client is entitled to,</v>

1959
01:52:01.541 --> 01:52:06.541
<v Speaker 4>their suffering is part of their like</v>
<v Speaker 4>adding your own misery for theirs is not</v>

1960
01:52:07.601 --> 01:52:12.580
<v Speaker 4>going to help them all doesn't muddle up</v>
<v Speaker 4>your thinking and it encroaches on their</v>

1961
01:52:12.581 --> 01:52:15.520
<v Speaker 4>territory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not there to take over their</v>

1962
01:52:15.521 --> 01:52:18.520
<v Speaker 4>version.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're here to help them attain clarity,</v>

1963
01:52:18.580 --> 01:52:20.850
<v Speaker 4>figure out how to lift properly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so it's your,</v>

1964
01:52:21.030 --> 01:52:26.030
<v Speaker 4>you have an ethical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's ethically required to stay detached</v>

1965
01:52:26.351 --> 01:52:29.290
<v Speaker 4>enough so that you're not damaged by the</v>
<v Speaker 4>encounter.</v>

1966
01:52:30.070 --> 01:52:32.830
<v Speaker 4>And you'll learn to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody motors to do that.</v>

1967
01:52:32.831 --> 01:52:34.840
<v Speaker 4>In graduate school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'd be surprised like,</v>

1968
01:52:34.841 --> 01:52:37.090
<v Speaker 4>cause it get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a perfectly valid question and</v>

1969
01:52:37.091 --> 01:52:41.440
<v Speaker 4>everybody wonders,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you learn how to do that and it's</v>

1970
01:52:41.441 --> 01:52:45.200
<v Speaker 4>still called Ollie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you learn how it's the right thing to</v>

1971
01:52:45.201 --> 01:52:46.640
<v Speaker 4>do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

1972
01:52:48.240 --> 01:52:51.240
<v Speaker 4>one more question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1973
01:52:52.130 --> 01:52:54.610
<v Speaker 4>The question about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you said some.</v>

1974
01:52:59.170 --> 01:53:00.590
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1975
01:53:00.810 --> 01:53:02.520
<v Speaker 4>how do you know if they're doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because they</v>

1976
01:53:05.310 --> 01:53:09.060
<v Speaker 4>look at your last year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this only started happening in the last</v>

1977
01:53:09.060 --> 01:53:10.440
<v Speaker 4>couple of years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I had a student last year,</v>

1978
01:53:11.100 --> 01:53:13.030
<v Speaker 4>two years since she didn't get in</v>
<v Speaker 4>anywhere.</v>

1979
01:53:13.500 --> 01:53:16.860
<v Speaker 4>It was she found out that just because</v>
<v Speaker 4>they looked earlier,</v>

1980
01:53:16.861 --> 01:53:19.680
<v Speaker 4>she had a pretty bad two year or two</v>
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>

1981
01:53:19.681 --> 01:53:24.180
<v Speaker 4>Would you be relevant?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hopefully she'll solve that by applying</v>

1982
01:53:24.181 --> 01:53:25.710
<v Speaker 4>to more places.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But</v>

1983
01:53:25.980 --> 01:53:28.380
<v Speaker 5>as the number of applications grow,</v>

1984
01:53:28.760 --> 01:53:33.760
<v Speaker 4>then the reason you know the methods by</v>
<v Speaker 4>which people will be dispensed with get</v>

1985
01:53:34.161 --> 01:53:35.930
<v Speaker 4>more general,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's reasonable,</v>

1986
01:53:35.931 --> 01:53:39.050
<v Speaker 4>but that's irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Reasonable has nothing to do with like</v>

1987
01:53:39.320 --> 01:53:41.510
<v Speaker 4>your best.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's just like I said this to apply</v>

1988
01:53:41.511 --> 01:53:44.780
<v Speaker 4>to more places</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if you don't check weight,</v>

1989
01:53:44.800 --> 01:53:49.800
<v Speaker 4>if you're a or a minus 80 80th</v>
<v Speaker 4>percentile junior reasonable bob,</v>

1990
01:53:51.050 --> 01:53:53.540
<v Speaker 4>you're recruiting a candidate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you hit it hard enough,</v>

1991
01:53:53.870 --> 01:53:56.220
<v Speaker 4>you'll probably find a place to go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1992
01:53:57.260 --> 01:53:58.380
<v Speaker 4>In the last two years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

1993
01:53:58.550 --> 01:54:01.180
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's still all right.</v>

1994
01:54:01.960 --> 01:54:06.960
<v Speaker 4>So</v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible]</v>

1995
01:54:13.890 --> 01:54:16.190
<v Speaker 4>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>On behalf of anyone</v>

1996
01:54:21.900 --> 01:54:26.900
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] I said yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you may or may not know this,</v>

1997
01:54:32.101 --> 01:54:34.990
<v Speaker 4>but the faculty and the student faculty</v>
<v Speaker 4>ratio of university</v>

1998
01:54:36.500 --> 01:54:41.500
<v Speaker 4>campuses for</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is outrageous and you guys put up.</v>

1999
01:54:43.910 --> 01:54:48.750
<v Speaker 4>So one of the things you might consider</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing is not putting up some letters to</v>

2000
01:54:48.751 --> 01:54:53.260
<v Speaker 4>the dean about the fact that you're a</v>
<v Speaker 4>450 of you to be shocked.</v>

2001
01:54:53.260 --> 01:54:56.880
<v Speaker 4>Me Number</v>
<v Speaker 4>five gram.</v>

2002
01:54:58.170 --> 01:55:03.170
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so 407,000 so you pay $3 million in</v>

2003
01:55:06.430 --> 01:55:09.100
<v Speaker 4>tuition for each professor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nam Salary,</v>

2004
01:55:10.710 --> 01:55:15.710
<v Speaker 4>50,000 got some</v>
<v Speaker 4>overhead is 300,000 you paid 10 times as</v>

2005
01:55:17.521 --> 01:55:20.330
<v Speaker 4>much as you should.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Her factory seller,</v>

2006
01:55:20.700 --> 01:55:25.110
<v Speaker 4>you're getting screwed and the reason</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're getting screwed as because he put</v>

2007
01:55:25.111 --> 01:55:29.460
<v Speaker 4>up and it's really not good because one</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the things that would help you</v>

2008
01:55:29.850 --> 01:55:34.710
<v Speaker 4>progress through your academic career as</v>
<v Speaker 4>a psychologist property is if you could</v>

2009
01:55:34.711 --> 01:55:38.480
<v Speaker 4>actually get access to a professor now</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then I'm talking about things.</v>

2010
01:55:39.120 --> 01:55:42.390
<v Speaker 4>So I would highly recommend it to do</v>
<v Speaker 4>this with the PSA.</v>

2011
01:55:43.290 --> 01:55:44.010
<v Speaker 4>Do something</v>

2012
01:55:44.010 --> 01:55:49.010
<v Speaker 1>about you're getting ripped off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no excuse for hundreds of one is</v>

2013
01:55:49.411 --> 01:55:54.411
<v Speaker 1>appalling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's 51 is a decent 451 your subsidized</v>

2014
01:55:55.490 --> 01:55:58.620
<v Speaker 1>the whole bloody university and there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>no excuse for it.</v>

2015
01:55:58.621 --> 01:56:01.950
<v Speaker 1>And he like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't bother me because I just</v>

2016
01:56:01.951 --> 01:56:03.900
<v Speaker 1>don't talk to students.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2017
01:56:03.980 --> 01:56:07.620
<v Speaker 1>Because I have a certain amount of time</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll talk to as many students as I</v>

2018
01:56:07.621 --> 01:56:10.100
<v Speaker 1>can and pass that I didn't talk to</v>
<v Speaker 1>students cause I can't.</v>

2019
01:56:10.410 --> 01:56:15.410
<v Speaker 1>So it isn't bothering me except that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you what?</v>

2020
01:56:16.591 --> 01:56:19.590
<v Speaker 1>You should do something about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is no excuse for it.</v>

2021
01:56:19.591 --> 01:56:22.960
<v Speaker 1>And unless you pushed on university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will know what I'm doing.</v>

2022
01:56:23.490 --> 01:56:28.020
<v Speaker 1>So when you're paying 3 million bucks</v>
<v Speaker 1>per professor just hired here,</v>

2023
01:56:28.021 --> 01:56:31.680
<v Speaker 1>we only know English professors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not good.</v>

2024
01:56:31.740 --> 01:56:35.160
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's the worst faculty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the student to faculty ratio of any</v>

2025
01:56:35.161 --> 01:56:40.161
<v Speaker 1>department at the University of Toronto</v>
<v Speaker 1>by a huge margin and a bone psychology</v>

2026
01:56:41.431 --> 01:56:44.220
<v Speaker 1>departments across North America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about the worst.</v>

2027
01:56:44.680 --> 01:56:47.980
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should use</v>

2028
01:56:49.500 --> 01:56:52.990
<v Speaker 2>no one</v>
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

2029
01:57:05.250 --> 01:57:06.640
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have a rough kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>truck.</v>

2030
01:57:06.650 --> 01:57:08.980
<v Speaker 2>Does he downloaded design basically</v>
<v Speaker 2>going now,</v>

2031
01:57:11.630 --> 01:57:12.950
<v Speaker 2>have you talked to Shelly Carson.</v>
