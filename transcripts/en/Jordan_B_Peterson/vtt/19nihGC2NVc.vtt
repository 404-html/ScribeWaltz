1
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.780
<v Speaker 1>Hi there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I released,</v>

2
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.410
<v Speaker 1>this is the third of three videos that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm releasing this morning.</v>

3
00:00:22.411 --> 00:00:23.244
<v Speaker 1>And the first one deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just read the letter from the </v>

4
00:00:25.381 --> 00:00:28.380
<v Speaker 1>university administration requesting my </v>
<v Speaker 1>silence.</v>

5
00:00:28.381 --> 00:00:29.214
<v Speaker 1>And then in the second one I detailed </v>
<v Speaker 1>out my response and said that I was </v>

6
00:00:32.911 --> 00:00:36.360
<v Speaker 1>going to meet with the dean of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Faculty of Arts and Sciences,</v>

7
00:00:36.361 --> 00:00:37.194
<v Speaker 1>David Cameron.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I had gone to meet with David on </v>

8
00:00:40.441 --> 00:00:44.610
<v Speaker 1>Friday to discuss what had happened and </v>
<v Speaker 1>to discuss the letter.</v>

9
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.253
<v Speaker 1>And we had a good meeting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had a good meeting and he's a </v>

10
00:00:48.421 --> 00:00:50.340
<v Speaker 1>reasonable person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

11
00:00:50.341 --> 00:00:51.174
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I suggested because I thought before </v>

12
00:00:53.101 --> 00:00:55.320
<v Speaker 1>the meeting and I talked to my family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

13
00:00:55.321 --> 00:00:56.154
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the best possible way this could </v>

14
00:00:57.061 --> 00:01:00.170
<v Speaker 1>move forward so that it would be in </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's best interest,</v>

15
00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.870
<v Speaker 1>mine and the universities and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>broader public and the students and,</v>

16
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.190
<v Speaker 1>and everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we thought that the best thing to</v>

17
00:01:08.191 --> 00:01:10.710
<v Speaker 1>happen would be that the university </v>
<v Speaker 1>could agree to host a,</v>

18
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.300
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a debate,</v>

19
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.163
<v Speaker 1>a public debate about the issue about </v>
<v Speaker 1>bill see 16 and about legislation like </v>

20
00:01:17.101 --> 00:01:19.430
<v Speaker 1>it and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

21
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.273
<v Speaker 1>that would be officially hosted by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>university and I could present my case </v>

22
00:01:22.651 --> 00:01:27.360
<v Speaker 1>and whoever wanted to present their case</v>
<v Speaker 1>contrary to what I've been stating would</v>

23
00:01:27.361 --> 00:01:28.320
<v Speaker 1>be invited to.</v>

24
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.213
<v Speaker 1>And so the Dean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>David Cameron said that he had to talk </v>

25
00:01:32.401 --> 00:01:35.850
<v Speaker 1>to some people and that he would get </v>
<v Speaker 1>back to me as soon as possible.</v>

26
00:01:35.851 --> 00:01:39.480
<v Speaker 1>And so over the weekend he talked to </v>
<v Speaker 1>mark Gertler,</v>

27
00:01:39.481 --> 00:01:42.420
<v Speaker 1>who's the president of the university </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the provost,</v>

28
00:01:42.421 --> 00:01:46.080
<v Speaker 1>sheryl red air and the vp of hr,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kelly,</v>

29
00:01:46.081 --> 00:01:48.540
<v Speaker 1>Hannah Moffitt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they agreed to go forward with it.</v>

30
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.170
<v Speaker 1>And so I was thrilled and I still am </v>
<v Speaker 1>thrilled and,</v>

31
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.080
<v Speaker 1>and so good because that means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

32
00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:58.080
<v Speaker 1>one of the things we talked about was </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we could talk about this,</v>

33
00:01:58.081 --> 00:02:01.260
<v Speaker 1>like civilized human beings and we could</v>
<v Speaker 1>discuss the real issues here.</v>

34
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.363
<v Speaker 1>And maybe as well we could use the </v>
<v Speaker 1>University of Toronto as a model to all </v>

35
00:02:05.971 --> 00:02:08.220
<v Speaker 1>universities who've been dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>this sort of thing too,</v>

36
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.350
<v Speaker 1>about how to actually deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

37
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.243
<v Speaker 1>like people who are rational and </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent and careful and thoughtful </v>

38
00:02:14.971 --> 00:02:15.804
<v Speaker 1>in all of that.</v>

39
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.040
<v Speaker 1>And so they agreed to the public debate </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we talked about two other issues.</v>

40
00:02:20.041 --> 00:02:20.874
<v Speaker 1>One was they were concerned during the </v>
<v Speaker 1>meeting about the possibility of </v>

41
00:02:24.391 --> 00:02:26.970
<v Speaker 1>security violations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

42
00:02:26.971 --> 00:02:27.804
<v Speaker 1>demonstrations and that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they thought for a while about </v>

43
00:02:30.241 --> 00:02:32.610
<v Speaker 1>only holding it online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they decided not to do that,</v>

44
00:02:32.611 --> 00:02:36.060
<v Speaker 1>to do it as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a university function live,</v>

45
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.943
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we talked about security concerns </v>

46
00:02:41.101 --> 00:02:43.560
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and agreed at least tentatively that the</v>

47
00:02:43.561 --> 00:02:47.550
<v Speaker 1>rule would be that unwarranted </v>
<v Speaker 1>disruptions will be stopped.</v>

48
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.180
<v Speaker 1>So that because both sides are going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be represented in this debate and,</v>

49
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.093
<v Speaker 1>and I hope they can find someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>articulate and intelligent to make a </v>

50
00:02:55.231 --> 00:02:57.330
<v Speaker 1>case for the other side because that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what we want.</v>

51
00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.230
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

52
00:02:59.231 --> 00:03:00.064
<v Speaker 1>this is unbelievably good news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievably good news because it </v>

53
00:03:02.501 --> 00:03:03.334
<v Speaker 1>means that the university has decided to</v>
<v Speaker 1>uphold its position as an investigator </v>

54
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.650
<v Speaker 1>into complex intellectual matters.</v>

55
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.250
<v Speaker 1>And that we can discuss this like with </v>
<v Speaker 1>like civilized human beings.</v>

56
00:03:15.251 --> 00:03:18.040
<v Speaker 1>And so my Kudos to the University of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Toronto,</v>

57
00:03:18.041 --> 00:03:18.874
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've said from the beginning that this </v>

58
00:03:20.171 --> 00:03:23.650
<v Speaker 1>is an institute that I've respected and </v>
<v Speaker 1>admired and I'm grateful to for,</v>

59
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.050
<v Speaker 1>for providing me with the position that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I have.</v>

60
00:03:26.051 --> 00:03:30.520
<v Speaker 1>And I am so absolutely thrilled that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they decided to do the right thing.</v>

61
00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.380
<v Speaker 1>And not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I got to tell you,</v>

62
00:03:32.381 --> 00:03:36.010
<v Speaker 1>and this is God's honest truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>David thanked me for bringing the issues</v>

63
00:03:36.011 --> 00:03:37.720
<v Speaker 1>to their attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he meant it.</v>

64
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.350
<v Speaker 1>So hurray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so good.</v>

65
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.010
<v Speaker 1>So strike one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

66
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.870
<v Speaker 1>Mark went up on the wall for free speech</v>
<v Speaker 1>and for the University of Toronto.</v>

67
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.393
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'd like to thank all the people </v>

68
00:03:52.961 --> 00:03:53.794
<v Speaker 1>that have been supporting me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been very helpful and your letters </v>

69
00:03:55.961 --> 00:03:58.000
<v Speaker 1>were very useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

70
00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.740
<v Speaker 1>we can talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can talk,</v>

71
00:03:59.741 --> 00:04:02.620
<v Speaker 1>we can talk these things through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's do it.</v>

72
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:04.930
<v Speaker 1>Excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bye.</v>
