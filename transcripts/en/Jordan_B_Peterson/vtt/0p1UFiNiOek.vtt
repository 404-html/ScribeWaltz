1
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.780
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.770
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so as some of you may know,</v>

3
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.920
<v Speaker 2>I went to give a talk at mcmaster </v>
<v Speaker 2>university on Friday.</v>

4
00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:54.303
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

5
00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.913
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6
00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.853
<v Speaker 2>it was originally supposed to be a panel</v>
<v Speaker 2>with three other people and also a </v>

7
00:01:02.381 --> 00:01:07.381
<v Speaker 2>moderator and the panelists and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>moderator either chose to or were forced</v>

8
00:01:07.391 --> 00:01:12.391
<v Speaker 2>to buy wild as a consequence of public </v>
<v Speaker 2>pressure being applied to them for being</v>

9
00:01:12.821 --> 00:01:15.250
<v Speaker 2>willing to appear with me on the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>stage.</v>

10
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.433
<v Speaker 2>And so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went there and talked and there was a </v>

11
00:01:17.621 --> 00:01:18.640
<v Speaker 2>lot of protesting,</v>

12
00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:32.613
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of disruption and that's fine </v>

13
00:01:34.061 --> 00:01:37.960
<v Speaker 2>because people can say what they want </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I suppose they can do what they want</v>

14
00:01:37.961 --> 00:01:39.970
<v Speaker 2>to and I'm not complaining about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

15
00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.730
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I got home tonight,</v>

16
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.660
<v Speaker 2>I found this other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

17
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.100
<v Speaker 2>missive from mcmaster university,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

18
00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.080
<v Speaker 2>this organization called,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

19
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.973
<v Speaker 2>pack vic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I want to read it to you because it </v>

20
00:01:53.861 --> 00:01:55.930
<v Speaker 2>actually does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it irritates me half to death.</v>

21
00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.400
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

22
00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:58.690
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll read,</v>

23
00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.730
<v Speaker 2>I'll read it to you and you can make up </v>
<v Speaker 2>your own mind.</v>

24
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.833
<v Speaker 2>March 16th,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2017 statement re mcmaster event </v>

25
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.930
<v Speaker 2>featuring Dr. Jordan Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>professor of psychology,</v>

26
00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.660
<v Speaker 2>University of Toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are deeply troubled.</v>

27
00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.853
<v Speaker 2>The Dr. Jordan Peterson has been invited</v>
<v Speaker 2>to speak at mcmaster at an upcoming </v>

28
00:02:18.431 --> 00:02:19.264
<v Speaker 2>event about quote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom of speech and quote and </v>

29
00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.270
<v Speaker 2>political correctness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most recently,</v>

30
00:02:25.271 --> 00:02:26.104
<v Speaker 2>Dr. Peterson has gained notoriety for </v>
<v Speaker 2>his refusal to use the preferred </v>

31
00:02:29.651 --> 00:02:32.560
<v Speaker 2>pronouns of trans and gender </v>
<v Speaker 2>nonconforming colleagues.</v>

32
00:02:32.561 --> 00:02:33.394
<v Speaker 2>The students at u of t defending his </v>
<v Speaker 2>callous disregard for their personhood </v>

33
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.433
<v Speaker 2>through a misguided deference to his </v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom of speech and his distaste for </v>

34
00:02:41.141 --> 00:02:41.974
<v Speaker 2>political correctness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but freedom of speech doesn't now it </v>

35
00:02:44.741 --> 00:02:45.574
<v Speaker 2>hasn't ever meant that we can or should </v>
<v Speaker 2>be able to say whatever we like in </v>

36
00:02:49.031 --> 00:02:52.600
<v Speaker 2>public spaces regardless of the impact </v>
<v Speaker 2>of our speech on others.</v>

37
00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.853
<v Speaker 2>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the concept of freedom of speech has </v>

38
00:02:55.571 --> 00:03:00.571
<v Speaker 2>most often been mobilized to protect </v>
<v Speaker 2>specifically counter mnemonic ideas,</v>

39
00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.050
<v Speaker 2>ideas that actually challenge rather </v>
<v Speaker 2>than reiterate the status quo.</v>

40
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.143
<v Speaker 2>Freedom of speech was also not conceived</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a means to protect normative ideas </v>

41
00:03:10.631 --> 00:03:13.600
<v Speaker 2>from contact station by marginalized </v>
<v Speaker 2>communities,</v>

42
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:14.643
<v Speaker 2>but to protect those who speech might </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually contest normative or </v>

43
00:03:17.771 --> 00:03:18.604
<v Speaker 2>nationalist ideals from sensor </v>
<v Speaker 2>punishment or retaliation by state </v>

44
00:03:22.391 --> 00:03:23.224
<v Speaker 2>forces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing rebellious or </v>

45
00:03:25.391 --> 00:03:26.224
<v Speaker 2>revolutionary about insisting on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>naturalness of the now long debunked </v>

46
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.970
<v Speaker 2>gender binary or of what Dr. Peterson </v>
<v Speaker 2>describes as quote,</v>

47
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.720
<v Speaker 2>the biological fact and quote of sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference.</v>

48
00:03:37.721 --> 00:03:40.840
<v Speaker 2>Neatly categorizable as quote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>male quote,</v>

49
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.890
<v Speaker 2>end quote and quote female and quote a </v>
<v Speaker 2>quote,</v>

50
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.140
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can hardly read this.</v>

51
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.903
<v Speaker 2>There is nothing rebellious or </v>
<v Speaker 2>revolutionary about insisting on the </v>

52
00:03:53.171 --> 00:03:57.610
<v Speaker 2>naturalness of the open parentheses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now long debunked,</v>

53
00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:58.683
<v Speaker 2>closed parentheses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gender binary or of what Dr. Peterson </v>

54
00:04:02.621 --> 00:04:03.454
<v Speaker 2>describes as the open quote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>biological fact closed quote of sexual </v>

55
00:04:07.961 --> 00:04:11.320
<v Speaker 2>difference,</v>
<v Speaker 2>neatly categorizable as open quote,</v>

56
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.730
<v Speaker 2>male and quote and open quote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>female end quote,</v>

57
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.060
<v Speaker 2>open parentheses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>open quote,</v>

58
00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.960
<v Speaker 2>fact closed quote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>subjected to intense critique,</v>

59
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.220
<v Speaker 2>questioning and reconsideration by </v>
<v Speaker 2>numerous scholars in the humanities,</v>

60
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:28.143
<v Speaker 2>social sciences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and even the biological sciences for </v>

61
00:04:30.431 --> 00:04:34.270
<v Speaker 2>several decades now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which demonstrates the limited extent of</v>

62
00:04:34.271 --> 00:04:35.104
<v Speaker 2>Dr Peterson's knowledge on this subject </v>
<v Speaker 2>since he seems either an entirely </v>

63
00:04:39.041 --> 00:04:39.874
<v Speaker 2>unaware of this body of literature or </v>
<v Speaker 2>else unwilling to engage with the </v>

64
00:04:43.121 --> 00:04:45.670
<v Speaker 2>challenge it poses for his own </v>
<v Speaker 2>arguments,</v>

65
00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.020
<v Speaker 2>close parentheses.</v>

66
00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:48.543
<v Speaker 2>There is nothing subversive or radical </v>
<v Speaker 2>about suggesting that one ought to be </v>

67
00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:52.624
<v Speaker 2>entitled to read the complexities of </v>
<v Speaker 2>gender identification on the basis of a </v>

68
00:04:56.471 --> 00:05:00.070
<v Speaker 2>quick and unwanted scrutiny of others </v>
<v Speaker 2>bodies and appearance.</v>

69
00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.130
<v Speaker 2>This is not a freedom that needs to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>defended,</v>

70
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.113
<v Speaker 2>but rather than simplistic reassertion </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the status quo of ideas about gender </v>

71
00:05:07.601 --> 00:05:08.434
<v Speaker 2>and sexual difference that have become </v>
<v Speaker 2>and stubbornly remained very widespread </v>

72
00:05:11.861 --> 00:05:12.694
<v Speaker 2>and common sensical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even in the face of mountains of </v>

73
00:05:15.191 --> 00:05:16.024
<v Speaker 2>academic evidence to the contrary and </v>
<v Speaker 2>legislative changes made to protect the </v>

74
00:05:19.301 --> 00:05:22.300
<v Speaker 2>human rights of trans and gender </v>
<v Speaker 2>nonconforming persons.</v>

75
00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:23.463
<v Speaker 2>So let us not pretend the Dr. Peterson </v>
<v Speaker 2>is a staunch defender of any sort of </v>

76
00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.070
<v Speaker 2>open quote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom close quote.</v>

77
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.083
<v Speaker 2>What he is defending instead appears to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be his misguided presumption that is </v>

78
00:05:34.721 --> 00:05:35.554
<v Speaker 2>right to uphold the status quo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trump's the right of others to exist in </v>

79
00:05:38.351 --> 00:05:41.350
<v Speaker 2>public spaces and be treated with </v>
<v Speaker 2>respect and dignity,</v>

80
00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:46.410
<v Speaker 2>free from hatred and discrimination and </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a world where hate and discrimination</v>

81
00:05:46.541 --> 00:05:49.330
<v Speaker 2>continued to flourish and appear to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the rise,</v>

82
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.980
<v Speaker 2>his way of expressing his right amounts </v>
<v Speaker 2>to a presumptive sense of entitlement to</v>

83
00:05:53.981 --> 00:05:57.160
<v Speaker 2>deny others their status as fully and </v>
<v Speaker 2>complex Lee human.</v>

84
00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.500
<v Speaker 2>There was nothing new about Dr </v>
<v Speaker 2>Peterson's position.</v>

85
00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:04.370
<v Speaker 2>Then it is a position taken by </v>
<v Speaker 2>multitudes of others before him.</v>

86
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:05.773
<v Speaker 2>There was also little to be gained by </v>
<v Speaker 2>debating Dr. Peterson because he </v>

87
00:06:08.481 --> 00:06:09.314
<v Speaker 2>presents no argument founded on evidence</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would actually be worthy of debate </v>

88
00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:17.150
<v Speaker 2>unless one is of the view that certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are less than fully and calm,</v>

89
00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:18.483
<v Speaker 2>flex a human of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and are deserving of being treated with </v>

90
00:06:21.171 --> 00:06:24.110
<v Speaker 2>callous disregard for their personhood </v>
<v Speaker 2>in public spaces,</v>

91
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:28.910
<v Speaker 2>in which case such views because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>rest on faulty evidence and because they</v>

92
00:06:28.911 --> 00:06:29.744
<v Speaker 2>stand directly in the way of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>substantive inclusion of marginalized </v>

93
00:06:32.421 --> 00:06:33.254
<v Speaker 2>communities in our public institutions </v>
<v Speaker 2>are deeply unsettling and required </v>

94
00:06:36.701 --> 00:06:41.240
<v Speaker 2>critical questioning and contestation </v>
<v Speaker 2>whenever and wherever they articulated.</v>

95
00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:42.973
<v Speaker 2>We stand in solidarity with Trans and </v>
<v Speaker 2>gender nonconforming members of our </v>

96
00:06:46.101 --> 00:06:50.210
<v Speaker 2>communities who have been called upon </v>
<v Speaker 2>repeatedly in the last several months to</v>

97
00:06:50.211 --> 00:06:54.800
<v Speaker 2>publicly respond to and challenge Dr </v>
<v Speaker 2>Peterson's views and to articulate again</v>

98
00:06:54.801 --> 00:06:55.634
<v Speaker 2>and again why are they should be able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>participate fully and meaningfully and </v>

99
00:06:58.671 --> 00:07:02.030
<v Speaker 2>public institutions in ways that reflect</v>
<v Speaker 2>their humanity.</v>

100
00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:03.553
<v Speaker 2>We anticipate that Dr Peterson's talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>will and should result in public </v>

101
00:07:07.581 --> 00:07:08.414
<v Speaker 2>critical opposition to his ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including public opposition to how he's </v>

102
00:07:11.511 --> 00:07:13.970
<v Speaker 2>treated trans and gender nonconforming </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

103
00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:16.220
<v Speaker 2>which may take the form of public </v>
<v Speaker 2>protest</v>

104
00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:38.343
<v Speaker 2>in the present climate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Proponents of free speech may try to </v>

105
00:07:40.541 --> 00:07:41.374
<v Speaker 2>paint such opposition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just another indicator that Dr </v>

106
00:07:43.601 --> 00:07:46.420
<v Speaker 2>Peterson's freedom of speech is in fact </v>
<v Speaker 2>under threat.</v>

107
00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:49.660
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we suggest that were ever free speech is</v>

108
00:07:49.661 --> 00:07:53.830
<v Speaker 2>valued protest to must be valued as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>legitimate exercise of that freedom,</v>

109
00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.113
<v Speaker 2>but protest does more than this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It also leads to articulate and demand </v>

110
00:07:58.061 --> 00:07:58.894
<v Speaker 2>the kind of university and the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>society many of us are fighting for one </v>

111
00:08:02.051 --> 00:08:02.884
<v Speaker 2>in which we recognize that speech or </v>
<v Speaker 2>action that reduces the humanity of any </v>

112
00:08:06.161 --> 00:08:08.770
<v Speaker 2>group or people is not an exercise of </v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom,</v>

113
00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:09.753
<v Speaker 2>but instead poses a threat to us all.</v>

00:08:26.381 --> 00:08:27.214
<v Speaker 2>union queer students,</v>
<v Speaker 2>community central coordinator and the </v>

118
00:08:29.711 --> 00:08:34.090
<v Speaker 2>mcmaster students union women and Gender</v>
<v Speaker 2>Equity Neck network coordinator.</v>

119
00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:35.770
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>

120
00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:36.933
<v Speaker 2>So here's the point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This letter states there is nothing </v>

121
00:08:40.391 --> 00:08:41.224
<v Speaker 2>rebellious or revolutionary about </v>
<v Speaker 2>insisting on the naturalness of the now </v>

122
00:08:45.281 --> 00:08:50.281
<v Speaker 2>long debunked gender binary or of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dr. Peterson describes as the biological</v>

123
00:08:50.501 --> 00:08:54.430
<v Speaker 2>fact of sexual difference,</v>
<v Speaker 2>neatly categorizable as male and female,</v>

124
00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:55.653
<v Speaker 2>a fact subjected to intense critique,</v>
<v Speaker 2>questioning and reconsideration by </v>

125
00:08:58.801 --> 00:09:01.320
<v Speaker 2>numerous scholars in the humanities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>social sciences,</v>

126
00:09:01.321 --> 00:09:04.770
<v Speaker 2>and even the biological sciences for </v>
<v Speaker 2>several decades now,</v>

127
00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:05.963
<v Speaker 2>which demonstrates the limited extent of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dr Peterson's knowledge on this subject </v>

128
00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:10.223
<v Speaker 2>since he seems either leak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>either an entirely unaware of this body </v>

129
00:09:13.441 --> 00:09:14.274
<v Speaker 2>of literature or else unwilling to </v>
<v Speaker 2>engage with the challenge it poses for </v>

130
00:09:17.701 --> 00:09:20.040
<v Speaker 2>his own arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

131
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:21.143
<v Speaker 2>no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is what I'll say about that to </v>

132
00:09:25.111 --> 00:09:25.944
<v Speaker 2>the members of the PAC buik president </v>
<v Speaker 2>advisory committee on building an </v>

133
00:09:29.431 --> 00:09:30.264
<v Speaker 2>inclusive community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you would like to debate with me </v>

134
00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:34.043
<v Speaker 2>about the issue of gender and sexuality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm willing to do that with as many </v>

135
00:09:37.891 --> 00:09:41.130
<v Speaker 2>people as you want to put forward at any</v>
<v Speaker 2>time you want,</v>

136
00:09:41.131 --> 00:09:42.870
<v Speaker 2>at any place of your choosing.</v>

137
00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:46.890
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully sooner rather than later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you're not willing to do that,</v>

138
00:09:46.891 --> 00:09:47.724
<v Speaker 2>and you're going to write cowardly </v>
<v Speaker 2>little letters like this and make them </v>

139
00:09:49.621 --> 00:09:52.860
<v Speaker 2>make them public instead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might suggest that if you're unwilling</v>

140
00:09:52.861 --> 00:09:53.694
<v Speaker 2>to defend your ideas of public,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you should just shut up and go </v>

141
00:09:55.981 --> 00:09:58.530
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I might also suggest that you should</v>

142
00:09:58.531 --> 00:09:59.364
<v Speaker 2>stop teaching students to kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>nonsense that you are teaching them </v>

143
00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:03.940
<v Speaker 2>anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have much more to say than that,</v>

144
00:10:03.941 --> 00:10:04.774
<v Speaker 2>except I'll just repeat it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no problem defending my ideas </v>

145
00:10:09.151 --> 00:10:13.410
<v Speaker 2>about gender and sexual difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you guys think that you know what</v>

146
00:10:13.411 --> 00:10:14.244
<v Speaker 2>the hell you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then why don't you come out and face me </v>

147
00:10:16.471 --> 00:10:21.000
<v Speaker 2>instead of sending your student proxies </v>
<v Speaker 2>to complain about me when I come to your</v>

148
00:10:21.001 --> 00:10:25.560
<v Speaker 2>university to try to make a case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're a polling Lee cowardly.</v>

149
00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:29.340
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm calling you out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come and debate me whenever you want.</v>

150
00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:30.713
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

151
00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:39.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get</v>

152
00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:35.620
<v Speaker 1>me</v>
<v Speaker 1>killed.</v>

153
00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:04.120
<v Speaker 1>You</v>
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

154
00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:06.460
<v Speaker 1>in this world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two kinds of people.</v>

155
00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:09.110
<v Speaker 1>My friend loaded guns.</v>
