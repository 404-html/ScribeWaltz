1
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.930
<v Speaker 1>It's on me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There we go.</v>

2
00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:04.860
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're live.</v>

3
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:06.210
<v Speaker 1>We're live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Cow.</v>

4
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.051
<v Speaker 1>Hello,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Youtube.</v>

5
00:00:07.051 --> 00:00:10.440
<v Speaker 1>We are live in Phoenix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're at Comerica theater.</v>

6
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.940
<v Speaker 1>I've got this Jordan Peterson guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Simon.</v>

7
00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm somehow hosting on his channel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't see right.</v>

8
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.590
<v Speaker 1>We're about to do what are maybe 13th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>14th,</v>

9
00:00:19.591 --> 00:00:21.120
<v Speaker 1>15th.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all starting to blend.</v>

10
00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:24.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a good way for this one.</v>

11
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.780
<v Speaker 1>You really stepped up in the wardrobe </v>
<v Speaker 1>department.</v>

12
00:00:27.781 --> 00:00:31.200
<v Speaker 1>I feel very sharp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sharp.</v>

13
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.450
<v Speaker 1>This thing has been unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

14
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:34.673
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty remarkable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this theater in Phoenix is one of </v>

15
00:00:37.951 --> 00:00:40.290
<v Speaker 1>the most interesting ones yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very big.</v>

16
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.050
<v Speaker 1>It's about eight stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>High side.</v>

17
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.083
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So about about 4,000 people waiting in </v>

18
00:00:46.111 --> 00:00:48.390
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about 105 and Phoenix today.</v>

19
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.750
<v Speaker 1>They're actually only here to purchase </v>
<v Speaker 1>the arch and</v>

20
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:53.693
<v Speaker 1>pretty much I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I literally went to the gym twice today </v>

21
00:00:55.681 --> 00:00:58.560
<v Speaker 1>to sweat indoors because it was so hot </v>
<v Speaker 1>outdoors.</v>

22
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.420
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we've been bouncing around.</v>

23
00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.840
<v Speaker 1>We just did three stops and tenses that </v>
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>

24
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.190
<v Speaker 1>Everything has been great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

25
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.283
<v Speaker 1>and what I say to you every night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say it before we started and then at </v>

26
00:01:09.091 --> 00:01:10.650
<v Speaker 1>the end it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

27
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.550
<v Speaker 1>everything that they say about this man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about this tour,</v>

28
00:01:14.551 --> 00:01:15.384
<v Speaker 1>about everything going on here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's completely the reverse of the </v>

29
00:01:18.601 --> 00:01:19.390
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

30
00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.760
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

31
00:01:20.761 --> 00:01:21.594
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spent a fair bit of time after the </v>

32
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.060
<v Speaker 1>lectures talking to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's usually about 150 people that I get</v>

33
00:01:27.061 --> 00:01:27.894
<v Speaker 1>to say hello to and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everybody has 15 seconds or so to </v>

34
00:01:32.221 --> 00:01:34.260
<v Speaker 1>tell me a story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't</v>

35
00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.430
<v Speaker 1>really low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Audio is low.</v>

36
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.550
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to talk louder.</v>

37
00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:39.331
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

38
00:01:39.331 --> 00:01:42.420
<v Speaker 1>We're going to talk louder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see if we can pick it up.</v>

39
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.480
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Energy,</v>

40
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.353
<v Speaker 1>peanuts in men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I talked to about 150 people </v>

41
00:01:48.571 --> 00:01:51.370
<v Speaker 1>afterwards and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

42
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:52.523
<v Speaker 1>they all have a story to tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most of the stories are variants on </v>

43
00:01:55.621 --> 00:01:58.260
<v Speaker 1>a theme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that they're happy to listen to</v>

44
00:01:58.261 --> 00:02:01.980
<v Speaker 1>the lectures because it's helping them </v>
<v Speaker 1>clarify their thinking or providing them</v>

45
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.960
<v Speaker 1>with words that they haven't had before.</v>

46
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:05.483
<v Speaker 1>Describe things they know to be true or </v>
<v Speaker 1>they tell me that they're doing better </v>

47
00:02:09.571 --> 00:02:13.520
<v Speaker 1>as a couple or the father and son </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're or or father and the daughter or</v>

48
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.490
<v Speaker 1>mother and the daughter and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting along better or it's a couple of</v>

49
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.080
<v Speaker 1>just decided to get engaged and their </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship is better.</v>

50
00:02:21.081 --> 00:02:24.290
<v Speaker 1>Or a father who's he was doing better </v>
<v Speaker 1>with his kids are,</v>

51
00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.240
<v Speaker 1>but none of it's political.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's political.</v>

52
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.220
<v Speaker 1>It's maybe it's maybe 10 percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>political and I'll.</v>

53
00:02:31.221 --> 00:02:35.490
<v Speaker 1>I'll talk to the camera for a second for</v>
<v Speaker 1>this because everyday when they tell you</v>

54
00:02:35.491 --> 00:02:38.370
<v Speaker 1>that Jordan's got angry white men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

55
00:02:38.371 --> 00:02:42.480
<v Speaker 1>That's first off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would guess it's about 60 slash 40,</v>

56
00:02:42.481 --> 00:02:46.050
<v Speaker 1>usually a male to female.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are gay people.</v>

57
00:02:46.051 --> 00:02:48.090
<v Speaker 1>There are black people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>white people,</v>

58
00:02:48.091 --> 00:02:51.720
<v Speaker 1>Asian people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were Muslims last night and Jews.</v>

59
00:02:51.721 --> 00:02:53.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of that diversity.</v>

60
00:02:53.611 --> 00:02:55.110
<v Speaker 1>That actually doesn't matter.</v>

61
00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.950
<v Speaker 1>It's all there and they just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just consistently lie about it.</v>

62
00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.083
<v Speaker 1>I think that it seems to me that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say the mainstream media types </v>

63
00:03:05.771 --> 00:03:06.604
<v Speaker 1>that have been pillaring me in various </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways don't have a lexicon for dealing </v>

64
00:03:13.031 --> 00:03:15.280
<v Speaker 1>with a phenomena that's primarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological.</v>

65
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.190
<v Speaker 1>They have to make this fundamentally </v>
<v Speaker 1>political,</v>

66
00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.710
<v Speaker 1>the political aspects of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

67
00:03:20.711 --> 00:03:24.460
<v Speaker 1>and so far as I'm not a fan of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>radical leftists for example.</v>

68
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.260
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by the way,</v>

69
00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.720
<v Speaker 1>you had been slamming the radical right </v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

70
00:03:28.721 --> 00:03:29.554
<v Speaker 1>I mean your whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is the irony of the </v>

71
00:03:30.971 --> 00:03:34.150
<v Speaker 1>situation is you talk about the identity</v>
<v Speaker 1>politics,</v>

72
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:35.223
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the danger of that as much almost </v>

73
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.610
<v Speaker 1>onstage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like collecting this.</v>

74
00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a bad route.</v>

75
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.373
<v Speaker 1>I think it takes us down a path and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that in destiny of a tribal path </v>

76
00:03:46.181 --> 00:03:49.900
<v Speaker 1>is bloodshed and I don't care whether </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the west wing or the right.</v>

77
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.003
<v Speaker 1>I'm more perturbed about the left lane </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of their dominance in the </v>

78
00:03:54.761 --> 00:03:58.230
<v Speaker 1>universities in particular and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>

79
00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lots were lower this came from,</v>

80
00:04:00.041 --> 00:04:02.830
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the collectivist issue that's the,</v>

81
00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:04.043
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has an almost everything that we've </v>

82
00:04:05.831 --> 00:04:06.664
<v Speaker 1>been talking about that I'm talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about with the audience is about the </v>

83
00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:10.624
<v Speaker 1>western tradition of individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility essentially also not </v>

84
00:04:13.421 --> 00:04:16.480
<v Speaker 1>individual rights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although they're part of the discussion.</v>

85
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:17.703
<v Speaker 1>It's funny to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would also say that in the </v>

86
00:04:20.591 --> 00:04:21.424
<v Speaker 1>collectivist lexical and there's no such</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing as free speech and there's really </v>

87
00:04:23.651 --> 00:04:24.484
<v Speaker 1>no such thing as individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility and so in so far as I'm </v>

88
00:04:28.781 --> 00:04:30.790
<v Speaker 1>able to make a case for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes me an enemy,</v>

89
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.540
<v Speaker 1>but even more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes the dialogue outside of their.</v>

90
00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.180
<v Speaker 1>The way they frame the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know what to do about it.</v>

91
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to handle it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they invent an enemy essentially.</v>

92
00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:42.293
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't really do the work </v>

93
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:43.803
<v Speaker 1>intellectually to counter the arguments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they just do the same old thing we </v>

94
00:04:46.981 --> 00:04:50.700
<v Speaker 1>were saying right before we started how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a year and a half ago.</v>

95
00:04:50.701 --> 00:04:51.840
<v Speaker 1>We didn't even know each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>

96
00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.600
<v Speaker 1>The first time we ever did anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>together was,</v>

97
00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.290
<v Speaker 1>I think it was November,</v>
<v Speaker 1>second of 2016,</v>

98
00:04:58.291 --> 00:05:00.090
<v Speaker 1>which was a day or two before the </v>
<v Speaker 1>American election.</v>

99
00:05:00.091 --> 00:05:02.340
<v Speaker 1>It feels like a lifetime ago when we </v>
<v Speaker 1>did,</v>

100
00:05:02.341 --> 00:05:05.490
<v Speaker 1>I just moved into my house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know my studio yet and we did a</v>

101
00:05:05.491 --> 00:05:06.324
<v Speaker 1>little google hangout thing and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>audio was terrible and the video is bad </v>

102
00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.430
<v Speaker 1>and you were telling me that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio Story,</v>

103
00:05:11.431 --> 00:05:12.264
<v Speaker 1>which now most of your audience knows </v>
<v Speaker 1>about and you were getting teary eyed </v>

104
00:05:14.671 --> 00:05:17.520
<v Speaker 1>and it and it ended and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I truly,</v>

105
00:05:17.521 --> 00:05:18.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've said this to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

106
00:05:18.781 --> 00:05:20.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't know exactly what to make of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy.</v>

107
00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:21.473
<v Speaker 1>And then subsequently you came on my </v>
<v Speaker 1>show many times and we've done a couple </v>

108
00:05:24.631 --> 00:05:25.464
<v Speaker 1>of hours together and we did the sit </v>
<v Speaker 1>down with Shapiro and it's like every </v>

109
00:05:29.221 --> 00:05:31.590
<v Speaker 1>month or two months this thing just </v>
<v Speaker 1>levels up,</v>

110
00:05:31.591 --> 00:05:34.680
<v Speaker 1>levels up and it feels more real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It feels more concrete.</v>

111
00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.620
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're all kind of growing together.</v>

112
00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.370
<v Speaker 1>But I gotta tell you man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we crossed 600,000 youtube subscribers.</v>

113
00:05:41.371 --> 00:05:44.160
<v Speaker 1>I think on the same day you got to like </v>
<v Speaker 1>one point two.</v>

114
00:05:44.161 --> 00:05:46.520
<v Speaker 1>Right now I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm almost at $800.</v>

115
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:51.100
<v Speaker 1>So it stopped me a good sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like competition.</v>

116
00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:53.110
<v Speaker 1>I do like competition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do like that,</v>

117
00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:56.500
<v Speaker 1>but it's just so cool watching this </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole thing growing.</v>

118
00:05:56.501 --> 00:05:59.980
<v Speaker 1>Luckily as as hundreds of millions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people come online,</v>

119
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.530
<v Speaker 1>we're not gonna run out of audience </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's another 2 billion people</v>

120
00:06:03.531 --> 00:06:04.364
<v Speaker 1>to join,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to join the electronic web with enough </v>

121
00:06:06.891 --> 00:06:09.070
<v Speaker 1>bandwidth to start streaming videos.</v>

122
00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.903
<v Speaker 1>So it looks to me like this whole online</v>
<v Speaker 1>video and audio and podcasts world is </v>

123
00:06:13.641 --> 00:06:17.300
<v Speaker 1>just getting its legs underneath it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God only knows where it's gonna go.</v>

124
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:18.223
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well since we're a behind the scenes in </v>

125
00:06:19.491 --> 00:06:20.324
<v Speaker 1>the green room here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just do a couple of behind the </v>

126
00:06:21.171 --> 00:06:22.790
<v Speaker 1>scenes things here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First off,</v>

127
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:23.773
<v Speaker 1>just how you feel while doing this whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing on my health is improving very </v>

128
00:06:26.781 --> 00:06:27.710
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm much,</v>

129
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:28.573
<v Speaker 1>much better than I was a month ago and </v>
<v Speaker 1>in comparatively better than I was a </v>

130
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:32.750
<v Speaker 1>year ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

131
00:06:32.751 --> 00:06:33.584
<v Speaker 1>So that's really working out well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm having a very nice time with the </v>

132
00:06:37.191 --> 00:06:38.870
<v Speaker 1>audiences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're unbelievably,</v>

133
00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:40.610
<v Speaker 1>isn't it incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

134
00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:43.540
<v Speaker 1>meeting these people like just literally</v>
<v Speaker 1>every.</v>

135
00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:45.790
<v Speaker 1>We haven't had one protest or no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

136
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:48.590
<v Speaker 1>just everywhere they're planning </v>
<v Speaker 1>something in Portland.</v>

137
00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:49.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

138
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.220
<v Speaker 1>we'll see about port credit or if it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna happen,</v>

139
00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.820
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna happen in Portland,</v>

140
00:06:52.821 --> 00:06:53.571
<v Speaker 1>but being really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

141
00:06:53.571 --> 00:06:55.220
<v Speaker 1>every night after the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

142
00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:58.370
<v Speaker 1>you meet a certain amount of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>afterwards and I usually go out into the</v>

143
00:06:58.371 --> 00:06:59.010
<v Speaker 1>crowd.</v>

144
00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:00.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's hundreds,</v>

145
00:07:00.081 --> 00:07:02.120
<v Speaker 1>sometimes thousands of people wait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

146
00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:03.630
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just want to hug you.</v>

147
00:07:03.631 --> 00:07:08.060
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of hugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty vicious people.</v>

148
00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:09.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

149
00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:10.700
<v Speaker 1>It's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not a Germaphobe.</v>

150
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

151
00:07:12.441 --> 00:07:16.730
<v Speaker 1>Well the other thing too is if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm protested enrichment or,</v>

152
00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.830
<v Speaker 1>or Portland to any degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to videotape the lecture elite</v>

153
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:21.703
<v Speaker 1>and put it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put it online and then people can see </v>

154
00:07:23.061 --> 00:07:24.890
<v Speaker 1>what's being protested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

155
00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:26.053
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the plan when we do </v>

156
00:07:27.111 --> 00:07:29.420
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've pretty much been different every</v>

157
00:07:29.421 --> 00:07:30.254
<v Speaker 1>single night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we've done about 15 shows and I </v>

158
00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:33.770
<v Speaker 1>mix it up a little bit every night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

159
00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:35.820
<v Speaker 1>and then a couple of jokes in there that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are the mainstays,</v>

160
00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:40.560
<v Speaker 1>some lobsters stuff and the rest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can dispatch the logs have to be</v>

161
00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:41.361
<v Speaker 1>in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

162
00:07:41.361 --> 00:07:42.194
<v Speaker 1>But you pretty much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the hour and a half that you do </v>

163
00:07:43.521 --> 00:07:45.140
<v Speaker 1>and then especially when we do the q and</v>
<v Speaker 1>a after,</v>

164
00:07:45.141 --> 00:07:49.740
<v Speaker 1>which is totally off the cuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're kind of just going in and out and</v>

165
00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:52.100
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you do three rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you do eight rules,</v>

166
00:07:52.101 --> 00:07:53.090
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you know rules.</v>

167
00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:54.350
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

168
00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:55.213
<v Speaker 1>well I'm trying to develop a very large </v>
<v Speaker 1>corpus of stories around each of the </v>

169
00:08:00.381 --> 00:08:01.214
<v Speaker 1>chapters and then I can mix and match </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and I'm also trying to push the </v>

170
00:08:04.371 --> 00:08:07.910
<v Speaker 1>ideas that I've been developing in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>book farther ahead with each talk.</v>

171
00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:09.253
<v Speaker 1>And so I spent a lot of time talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the relationship between </v>

172
00:08:12.231 --> 00:08:17.231
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies and goals and and and </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference in status.</v>

173
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:19.903
<v Speaker 1>That's been a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's been a main theme and the </v>

174
00:08:21.621 --> 00:08:26.360
<v Speaker 1>relationship between Truth and quality </v>
<v Speaker 1>of existence.</v>

175
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:29.540
<v Speaker 1>That's another one that there's a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful positive relationship.</v>

176
00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.870
<v Speaker 1>They're necessary and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of those themes,</v>

177
00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:34.173
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no end to the amount you can </v>

178
00:08:34.851 --> 00:08:35.684
<v Speaker 1>develop them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And each venue gives me an opportunity </v>

179
00:08:37.911 --> 00:08:38.744
<v Speaker 1>to push it a little bit farther and </v>
<v Speaker 1>clarify what I'm thinking and get the </v>

180
00:08:41.991 --> 00:08:42.824
<v Speaker 1>story a little bit tighter and see how </v>
<v Speaker 1>the audience see how the individuals in </v>

181
00:08:45.921 --> 00:08:47.090
<v Speaker 1>the audience are reacting.</v>

182
00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:52.420
<v Speaker 1>And so I liked the fact that you opened </v>
<v Speaker 1>with some with a humorous intro and then</v>

183
00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:54.373
<v Speaker 1>the q and a has an element of lightness </v>
<v Speaker 1>and comedy in it because one of the </v>

184
00:08:57.601 --> 00:08:58.434
<v Speaker 1>things I learned a long time ago was </v>
<v Speaker 1>that even if you're dealing with </v>

185
00:09:00.661 --> 00:09:04.740
<v Speaker 1>something that's extremely serious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can't do it with a comedic touch,</v>

186
00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:08.700
<v Speaker 1>then you haven't got the balance right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if it's deadly serious stuff.</v>

187
00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:12.780
<v Speaker 1>They love it when you make them laugh </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes accidentally.</v>

188
00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:14.640
<v Speaker 1>Then like they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they love that.</v>

189
00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:16.660
<v Speaker 1>They really love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

190
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:18.610
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:19.950
<v Speaker 1>you got to show today.</v>
