1
00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:00.943
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:04.213
<v Speaker 2>did you see the news?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Professor Jordan Peterson of the </v>

3
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.233
<v Speaker 2>University of Toronto,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the professor who's been fighting so </v>

4
00:00:09.261 --> 00:00:10.094
<v Speaker 2>valiantly for free speech and academic </v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom and against political </v>

5
00:00:12.951 --> 00:00:16.910
<v Speaker 2>correctness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has had his scholarly funding cut off</v>

6
00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.570
<v Speaker 2>his grant application to continue as </v>
<v Speaker 2>academic research.</v>

7
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.890
<v Speaker 2>It was rejected for the first time in </v>
<v Speaker 2>his career 10 times.</v>

8
00:00:24.891 --> 00:00:29.240
<v Speaker 2>He's applied 10 times as being granted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a successful professor,</v>

9
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.570
<v Speaker 2>beloved by his students,</v>
<v Speaker 2>huge popular following,</v>

10
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:33.613
<v Speaker 2>lots of published research.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'd normally be treated like an </v>

11
00:00:35.811 --> 00:00:36.644
<v Speaker 2>academic star,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as soon as he was attacked by the </v>

12
00:00:38.811 --> 00:00:42.380
<v Speaker 2>forces of political correctness and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>refused to submit to them.</v>

13
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.480
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just by coincidence,</v>

14
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.480
<v Speaker 2>he was cut off by an anonymous </v>
<v Speaker 2>government committee.</v>

15
00:00:47.481 --> 00:00:48.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not buying it.</v>

16
00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.400
<v Speaker 2>Just to be clear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this research money isn't his salary,</v>

17
00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:53.383
<v Speaker 2>it's the budget he needs to do his </v>
<v Speaker 2>research to hire graduate students and </v>

18
00:00:57.141 --> 00:01:00.380
<v Speaker 2>other out of pocket expenses to pursue </v>
<v Speaker 2>his scholarships.</v>

19
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.220
<v Speaker 2>That's what's being rejected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've cut off his studies,</v>

20
00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.750
<v Speaker 2>which just happens to include studying </v>
<v Speaker 2>the psychology of political correctness.</v>

21
00:01:08.751 --> 00:01:11.210
<v Speaker 2>So I said to professor Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

22
00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:12.943
<v Speaker 2>we can raise some money ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't need to depend on the </v>

23
00:01:15.051 --> 00:01:17.060
<v Speaker 2>government and they're anonymous </v>
<v Speaker 2>bureaucrats.</v>

24
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.000
<v Speaker 2>I know for a fact that hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of people,</v>

25
00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.760
<v Speaker 2>millions actually have watched his </v>
<v Speaker 2>videos,</v>

26
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.860
<v Speaker 2>read about them in the news,</v>
<v Speaker 2>support them.</v>

27
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.550
<v Speaker 2>What if everyone chipped in a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 2>for his research ourselves.</v>

28
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.090
<v Speaker 2>What if we set up a </v>
<v Speaker 2>website@wwwdotsupportpetersonresearch.com</v>

29
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.000
<v Speaker 2>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure,</v>

30
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:39.440
<v Speaker 2>let's give it a try.</v>

31
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.553
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why my research application</v>
<v Speaker 1>west rejected the reviews are anonymous </v>

32
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.933
<v Speaker 1>and all the reasons are not yet in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the first time my funding </v>

33
00:01:51.191 --> 00:01:52.024
<v Speaker 1>request is being rejected in 20 years of</v>
<v Speaker 1>applications and I think it's important </v>

34
00:01:55.211 --> 00:01:56.044
<v Speaker 1>research.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's basic science and more rarely it </v>

35
00:01:58.561 --> 00:02:01.270
<v Speaker 1>has immediate demonstrated public </v>
<v Speaker 1>applicability,</v>

36
00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:02.583
<v Speaker 1>which is hypothetically one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>social sciences and humanities research </v>

37
00:02:05.201 --> 00:02:06.370
<v Speaker 1>councils,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mandates.</v>

38
00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:07.743
<v Speaker 1>I requested funding to continue research</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the fundamentals of personality </v>

39
00:02:11.081 --> 00:02:14.260
<v Speaker 1>psychology by not published a paper in </v>
<v Speaker 1>2007.</v>

40
00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.900
<v Speaker 1>Dr Colin de Young was the primary </v>
<v Speaker 1>author,</v>

41
00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.610
<v Speaker 1>the differentiated the standard big five</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality model into 10 aspects.</v>

42
00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.010
<v Speaker 1>That's extroversion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism,</v>

43
00:02:24.011 --> 00:02:26.320
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness and openness.</v>

44
00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.240
<v Speaker 1>How we differentiate each of them into </v>
<v Speaker 1>to some some traits we call them aspects</v>

45
00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.040
<v Speaker 1>and that's become very widely used among</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists as has the work we've done on</v>

46
00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.883
<v Speaker 1>creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to understand everything we can </v>

47
00:02:37.841 --> 00:02:38.674
<v Speaker 1>about personality as it's an important </v>
<v Speaker 1>predictor of human behavior and I want </v>

48
00:02:41.861 --> 00:02:43.690
<v Speaker 1>to do the fundamental research property.</v>

49
00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.183
<v Speaker 1>We've also been assessing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship between personality and </v>

50
00:02:47.021 --> 00:02:48.670
<v Speaker 1>political belief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>liberal,</v>

51
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.833
<v Speaker 1>conservative and now politically correct</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's the first time the latter has </v>

52
00:02:53.201 --> 00:02:54.034
<v Speaker 1>been investigated scientifically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those beliefs are having a huge impact </v>

53
00:02:56.741 --> 00:02:59.230
<v Speaker 1>on our culture and we believe it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>important to understand.</v>

54
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:01.383
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've been producing online </v>

55
00:03:02.261 --> 00:03:04.990
<v Speaker 1>interventions such as the self authoring</v>
<v Speaker 1>suite.</v>

56
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.033
<v Speaker 1>You could see that@selfauthoring.com and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's helped thousands of students get </v>

57
00:03:09.491 --> 00:03:10.324
<v Speaker 1>better grades and stay in school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've raised the grade point average of </v>

58
00:03:12.761 --> 00:03:17.080
<v Speaker 1>students 25 percent drop the dropout </v>
<v Speaker 1>rate by about 20 percent and that's been</v>

59
00:03:17.081 --> 00:03:17.914
<v Speaker 1>especially useful for men and also for </v>
<v Speaker 1>non Western ethic minority students and </v>

60
00:03:21.221 --> 00:03:24.550
<v Speaker 1>we want to continue the basic research </v>
<v Speaker 1>upon which such programs depend.</v>

61
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.610
<v Speaker 1>I should know too that none of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>salary,</v>

62
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.800
<v Speaker 1>none of this research money goes to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of it.</v>

63
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.820
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't supplement my salary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't pay any of my personal expenses.</v>

64
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:35.043
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty much all spent on the celery</v>
<v Speaker 1>and tuition of my three graduate </v>

65
00:03:37.721 --> 00:03:40.960
<v Speaker 1>students and I have three excellent </v>
<v Speaker 1>graduate students and helps me support a</v>

66
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.943
<v Speaker 1>postpartum postdoctoral student.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The remainder pays research subjects </v>

67
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.790
<v Speaker 1>with a bit leftover for travel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're supposed to present the results of</v>

68
00:03:48.791 --> 00:03:49.624
<v Speaker 1>our research at scientific conferences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We spend a little bit on computer </v>

69
00:03:52.241 --> 00:03:54.310
<v Speaker 1>equipment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's bare bones funding.</v>

70
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.020
<v Speaker 1>Am I live is very efficient in spending,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the rejection of my grant application</v>

71
00:03:59.021 --> 00:03:59.854
<v Speaker 1>primarily hurts my students as well as </v>
<v Speaker 1>bringing the research effectively to a </v>

72
00:04:02.861 --> 00:04:05.530
<v Speaker 1>halt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'd like to try to crowd fund it.</v>

73
00:04:05.531 --> 00:04:08.830
<v Speaker 1>I think that would be interesting for </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who support my work,</v>

74
00:04:08.831 --> 00:04:12.310
<v Speaker 1>who've watched my videos or listening to</v>
<v Speaker 1>my podcasts are for anyone interested in</v>

75
00:04:12.311 --> 00:04:13.144
<v Speaker 1>the research that I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I could invite you to join us </v>

76
00:04:15.341 --> 00:04:17.350
<v Speaker 1>and be part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doing so.</v>

77
00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:18.183
<v Speaker 1>It would also help me learn whether that</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of funding for scientists as </v>

78
00:04:20.651 --> 00:04:21.484
<v Speaker 1>possible because I've already been </v>
<v Speaker 1>contacted by others whose research was </v>

79
00:04:24.551 --> 00:04:26.830
<v Speaker 1>curtailed for what appeared to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>political reasons,</v>

80
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.873
<v Speaker 1>so if it can be done for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps it can be done on a more </v>

81
00:04:29.471 --> 00:04:30.304
<v Speaker 1>permanent basis for others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be interesting to investigate that </v>

82
00:04:32.501 --> 00:04:33.334
<v Speaker 1>and see if it's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My application was for a five year </v>

83
00:04:35.951 --> 00:04:36.784
<v Speaker 1>grant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's less daunting if we do it one </v>

84
00:04:38.441 --> 00:04:40.570
<v Speaker 1>year at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>

85
00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:41.413
<v Speaker 1>You can see anyone interested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conceived by a full proposal and a </v>

86
00:04:43.901 --> 00:04:44.734
<v Speaker 1>shorter summary of it beneath this video</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now also app support Peterson </v>

87
00:04:48.461 --> 00:04:51.070
<v Speaker 1>research.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't come back to you.</v>

88
00:04:51.071 --> 00:04:53.700
<v Speaker 1>Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks Professor</v>

89
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.190
<v Speaker 2>Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll chip in the first $100.</v>

90
00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.640
<v Speaker 2>It's the least I can do in the name of </v>
<v Speaker 2>free speech and academic freedom.</v>

91
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.530
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that's too much for you,</v>

92
00:05:01.531 --> 00:05:05.190
<v Speaker 2>well please consider $10.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you can do more than $100,</v>

93
00:05:05.191 --> 00:05:06.024
<v Speaker 2>please do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyone who contributes $100 will get </v>

94
00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:14.030
<v Speaker 2>access to an exclusive thank you video </v>
<v Speaker 2>from Professor Peterson for just $100.</v>

95
00:05:15.271 --> 00:05:16.104
<v Speaker 2>Donors and anyone who contributes $250 </v>
<v Speaker 2>will be invited to a reception where he </v>

96
00:05:22.531 --> 00:05:23.364
<v Speaker 2>and his students will discuss his </v>
<v Speaker 2>progress and if you contribute the </v>

97
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.950
<v Speaker 2>thousand dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll get all of the above as well as a</v>

98
00:05:28.951 --> 00:05:33.570
<v Speaker 2>bound copy of the finished research </v>
<v Speaker 2>personally autographed by him.</v>

99
00:05:33.571 --> 00:05:38.571
<v Speaker 2>So let's do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go to support Peterson research.com.</v>

100
00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:39.733
<v Speaker 2>We'll send all of the net proceeds </v>
<v Speaker 2>directly to professor Peterson </v>

101
00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:43.163
<v Speaker 2>specifically for this research project.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's show the university and the </v>

102
00:05:47.101 --> 00:05:49.320
<v Speaker 2>government panel that rejected this </v>
<v Speaker 2>project.</v>

103
00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:50.603
<v Speaker 2>The Canadians believe in Professor </v>
<v Speaker 2>Peterson and his research and we're not </v>

104
00:05:54.061 --> 00:05:56.460
<v Speaker 2>willing to let him or his work be </v>
<v Speaker 2>silenced.</v>

105
00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:01.550
<v Speaker 2>Let's show Canada and the world that our</v>
<v Speaker 2>universities are still free.</v>

106
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:07.300
<v Speaker 2>Go to support Peterson research.com and </v>
<v Speaker 2>let's help a great professor and scholar</v>

107
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:10.520
<v Speaker 2>complete his work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
