<v Speaker 2>psychology people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jeffrey Miller.</v>

6
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:36.323
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We live in this till the day that we </v>

7
00:00:37.381 --> 00:00:38.214
<v Speaker 2>die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Survival or the feet only the strong </v>

8
00:00:40.351 --> 00:00:44.070
<v Speaker 2>survive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's walk and went on outside.</v>

9
00:00:44.071 --> 00:00:47.490
<v Speaker 2>No Man is safe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can run but you can't have ever,</v>

10
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.060
<v Speaker 2>you come to my black,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll see some territoriality.</v>

11
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.400
<v Speaker 2>You please wear a kill or be killed is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the mentality would get his street.</v>

12
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.280
<v Speaker 2>It's just a necessary strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to play the hand.</v>

13
00:00:56.281 --> 00:00:57.570
<v Speaker 2>You're dealt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What can magic?</v>

14
00:00:57.571 --> 00:00:58.404
<v Speaker 2>We escaped from the habitat that she was</v>
<v Speaker 2>born in three homicides and when </v>

15
00:01:01.621 --> 00:01:05.490
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood is cops came and kicked the</v>
<v Speaker 2>crooked door with no warning.</v>

16
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:06.453
<v Speaker 2>I started roughing up my young cousins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's only 17 and counterpoint in the </v>

17
00:01:09.901 --> 00:01:12.810
<v Speaker 2>oven plus a concussion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she ain't done nothing.</v>

18
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:13.763
<v Speaker 2>So keep your mouth shut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't jump to judgment on the lads were </v>

19
00:01:15.991 --> 00:01:16.620
<v Speaker 2>living.</v>

20
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.150
<v Speaker 2>Just close your eyes and listen with </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

21
00:01:18.151 --> 00:01:20.130
<v Speaker 2>Pre counsel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Homicide statistics.</v>

22
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.950
<v Speaker 2>So if you think the criminal man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just bacon,</v>

23
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.830
<v Speaker 2>you're mistaken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is calculated risk taking.</v>

24
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:26.723
<v Speaker 2>We did banana situation with the low </v>
<v Speaker 2>life expectancy and a major discrepancy </v>

25
00:01:30.721 --> 00:01:31.554
<v Speaker 2>between the haves and the have nots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And You wonder why the padlock on every </v>

26
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.210
<v Speaker 2>cashbox smashed off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>

27
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.460
<v Speaker 2>You can't call a pathological.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>

28
00:01:38.461 --> 00:01:40.710
<v Speaker 2>that's a logical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can try to understand it,</v>

29
00:01:40.711 --> 00:01:41.544
<v Speaker 2>but you can't stop a doe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Unless you address the root causes </v>

30
00:01:43.911 --> 00:01:48.180
<v Speaker 2>is the conscious and unconscious </v>
<v Speaker 2>decisions to discount future prospects.</v>

31
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.333
<v Speaker 2>C'Mon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's obvious the beekeeper bouncing </v>

32
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.930
<v Speaker 2>homicide rate keeps mounting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which leaves this deep discounting and a</v>

33
00:01:54.931 --> 00:01:56.460
<v Speaker 2>lot of violence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not.</v>

34
00:01:56.461 --> 00:01:57.294
<v Speaker 2>A virus is a rational response to high </v>
<v Speaker 2>risk environments and short time </v>

35
00:02:00.541 --> 00:02:01.374
<v Speaker 2>horizons with high stakes and highly </v>
<v Speaker 2>visible prizes and you wonder why we're </v>

36
00:02:04.441 --> 00:02:05.370
<v Speaker 2>criminal minded.</v>

37
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.080
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't say we'll get satisfaction and</v>

38
00:02:08.081 --> 00:02:08.914
<v Speaker 2>for patient with self control and delete</v>
<v Speaker 2>gratification when the only job that </v>

39
00:02:12.091 --> 00:02:12.924
<v Speaker 2>pays his casket baking death is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimate plan cancellation to check the </v>

40
00:02:16.831 --> 00:02:17.664
<v Speaker 2>facts and recent data release.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It shows a pattern of increasing </v>

41
00:02:19.981 --> 00:02:20.814
<v Speaker 2>competition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of young guys off struggling </v>

42
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:23.693
<v Speaker 2>status seeking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>causing the crabs and make the social </v>

43
00:02:25.681 --> 00:02:29.520
<v Speaker 2>fabric weekend and life expectancy also </v>
<v Speaker 2>predicts teen pregnancy.</v>

44
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:30.503
<v Speaker 2>The need to leave a legacy genetically </v>
<v Speaker 2>will never be completely control </v>

45
00:02:33.281 --> 00:02:34.140
<v Speaker 2>contraceptive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

46
00:02:34.141 --> 00:02:35.280
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the transparent.</v>

47
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.353
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if your kids would never meet </v>
<v Speaker 2>the grandparents unless they followed </v>

48
00:02:38.821 --> 00:02:43.100
<v Speaker 2>the Bristol Pailin Plan for parenthood </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they see these young girls were</v>

49
00:02:43.101 --> 00:02:43.934
<v Speaker 2>fall down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Carolyn's do get pregnant before </v>

50
00:02:45.241 --> 00:02:47.490
<v Speaker 2>marriage is such a tragedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apparently.</v>

51
00:02:47.491 --> 00:02:48.324
<v Speaker 2>It's also a reproductive strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when you could see them </v>

52
00:02:50.701 --> 00:02:53.160
<v Speaker 2>adjusting activity when their </v>
<v Speaker 2>circumstances change.</v>

53
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.820
<v Speaker 2>In both the cases of the young ladies </v>
<v Speaker 2>with babies in the mail risk takers,</v>

54
00:02:56.821 --> 00:03:00.280
<v Speaker 2>you see people that depth into their </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation and it's the same in different</v>

55
00:03:00.281 --> 00:03:01.660
<v Speaker 2>places and with different reasons.</v>

56
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.860
<v Speaker 2>This is not about ethical justification.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's evolutionary psych in,</v>

57
00:03:05.861 --> 00:03:07.450
<v Speaker 2>it's just the basics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm still,</v>

58
00:03:07.451 --> 00:03:08.284
<v Speaker 2>people call this behavior maladaptive </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of our reaction when violence </v>

59
00:03:11.411 --> 00:03:12.244
<v Speaker 2>happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if we really want to change the </v>

60
00:03:13.331 --> 00:03:14.164
<v Speaker 2>outcome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then maybe we should just start </v>

61
00:03:15.341 --> 00:03:18.940
<v Speaker 2>questioning how it's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the bottom line is that a nick woody</v>

62
00:03:18.941 --> 00:03:19.774
<v Speaker 2>and life expectancy or the ultimate </v>
<v Speaker 2>causes of crime and the results of </v>

63
00:03:23.291 --> 00:03:24.124
<v Speaker 2>crime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me that's true that you could bind </v>

64
00:03:25.631 --> 00:03:28.690
<v Speaker 2>together in a feedback loop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it got some moves to make now.</v>

65
00:03:28.691 --> 00:03:31.690
<v Speaker 2>So I'll be back soon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just don't ask me what I'm about to do,</v>

66
00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.160
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I can't see,</v>

67
00:03:33.161 --> 00:03:33.994
<v Speaker 2>so what's left the on tour effect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're my death and my goal is to </v>

68
00:03:36.361 --> 00:03:38.500
<v Speaker 2>stay alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Survival of the fee.</v>

69
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.300
<v Speaker 2>Only the strong survive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

70
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.160
<v Speaker 2>We live in this till the day that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>die.</v>

71
00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:43.363
<v Speaker 2>It's the Bible.</v>

72

<v Speaker 2>Only the strong survive been this till </v>
<v Speaker 2>the tea that we die survivals are the </v>

73
00:03:48.371 --> 00:03:50.440

<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

74

<v Speaker 2>We live in this till the tape that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>die.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Only the strong survive this till the </v>

76
00:03:56.681 --> 00:03:58.780
<v Speaker 2>day that we die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Survival of the fee.</v>

77
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.580
<v Speaker 2>Only the strong survive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

<v Speaker 2>We live in this till the tea that we dad</v>

98
00:05:34.421 --> 00:05:38.140
<v Speaker 3>evolutionary perspective on risk taking </v>
<v Speaker 3>and interpersonal violence,</v>

99
00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.540
<v Speaker 3>especially male male conflict</v>

107
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.273
<v Speaker 3>most outstanding psychologists and </v>
<v Speaker 3>perhaps you could say that about </v>

108
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:17.143
<v Speaker 3>psychologists in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's done some incredibly </v>

109
00:06:19.731 --> 00:06:24.731
<v Speaker 3>interesting research on the relationship</v>
<v Speaker 3>between inequality and male violence and</v>

110
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:30.320
<v Speaker 3>inequality and other topics too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So welcome Dr Daily.</v>

111
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:33.680
<v Speaker 3>Thank you Jordan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's nice to be talking to you.</v>

112
00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:34.933
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking forward to our conversation </v>

113
00:06:35.931 --> 00:06:37.790
<v Speaker 3>a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you just wrote a book,</v>

114
00:06:37.791 --> 00:06:41.240
<v Speaker 3>which I'm going to show people called </v>
<v Speaker 3>killing the competition</v>

115
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:44.900
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just read it.</v>

116
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:45.973
<v Speaker 3>It was very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I thought maybe I could get you to </v>

117
00:06:48.981 --> 00:06:50.970
<v Speaker 3>start by talking a little bit about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>book and,</v>

118
00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.570
<v Speaker 3>and also how you tell us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tell us the story that would be the,</v>

119
00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:55.940
<v Speaker 3>the good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a good thing to do.</v>

120
00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:57.873
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the general issue that is addressed in </v>

121
00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:05.080
<v Speaker 4>the book is the relationship between </v>
<v Speaker 4>economic and inequality,</v>

122
00:07:05.081 --> 00:07:10.081
<v Speaker 4>which is usually indexed as income </v>
<v Speaker 4>inequality and homicide rates.</v>

123
00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:11.523
<v Speaker 4>And it's been known for a long time by </v>
<v Speaker 4>sociologists that income inequality is </v>

124
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.500
<v Speaker 4>the single best predictor they've got of</v>
<v Speaker 4>homicide rates across countries,</v>

125
00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:21.483
<v Speaker 4>across states,</v>
<v Speaker 4>within the u s across cities within the </v>

126
00:07:23.981 --> 00:07:28.981
<v Speaker 4>u s and some other kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 4>jurisdictional comparisons and there has</v>

127
00:07:30.191 --> 00:07:31.024
<v Speaker 4>been controversy about why that is and </v>
<v Speaker 4>whether any quality itself is truly the </v>

128
00:07:35.591 --> 00:07:38.230
<v Speaker 4>problem or whether it's just a correlate</v>
<v Speaker 4>of something else.</v>

129
00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:39.413
<v Speaker 4>And in this book I tried to make the </v>
<v Speaker 4>case that no inequality really is the </v>

130
00:07:41.861 --> 00:07:42.694
<v Speaker 4>problem and some of the arguments that </v>
<v Speaker 4>have been events for suggesting that </v>

131
00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:46.203
<v Speaker 4>Amir correlate of violence rather than </v>
<v Speaker 4>in some way causal to violence are </v>

132
00:07:49.781 --> 00:07:50.614
<v Speaker 4>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can you tell us a little bit about how </v>

133
00:07:53.771 --> 00:07:56.530
<v Speaker 4>you calculate inequality and what the </v>
<v Speaker 4>measure is?</v>

134
00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.690
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>income inequality.</v>

135
00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:02.680
<v Speaker 4>There's a number of different measures </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are used by economists and I'm just</v>

136
00:08:02.681 --> 00:08:05.260
<v Speaker 4>borrowing the dominant ones from </v>
<v Speaker 4>economists.</v>

137
00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:09.010
<v Speaker 4>The number one one is something called </v>
<v Speaker 4>the Gini Index Gin.</v>

138
00:08:09.011 --> 00:08:11.590
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I used to assume that that was some kind</v>

139
00:08:11.591 --> 00:08:12.424
<v Speaker 4>of a acronym,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but actually it was the name of an </v>

140
00:08:13.991 --> 00:08:18.991
<v Speaker 4>Italian economist and it's a measured </v>
<v Speaker 4>that is rages from zero to one.</v>

141
00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:21.423
<v Speaker 4>It would be zero if everybody had </v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly the same income or exactly the </v>

142
00:08:25.451 --> 00:08:26.284
<v Speaker 4>same wealth if you're doing wealth </v>
<v Speaker 4>inequality and it would approach one as </v>

143
00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:31.653
<v Speaker 4>income or wealth was concentrated more </v>
<v Speaker 4>and more in the hands of few and then a </v>

144
00:08:35.591 --> 00:08:36.424
<v Speaker 4>single individual and in principle would</v>
<v Speaker 4>go to one in the extreme if all wealth </v>

145
00:08:40.451 --> 00:08:43.660
<v Speaker 4>were held by Bill Gates and done in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>rest of us had anything.</v>

146
00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:47.043
<v Speaker 3>Now you analyze the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the judy coefficient to have different </v>

147
00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:51.730
<v Speaker 3>levels of of jurisdiction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

148
00:08:51.731 --> 00:08:52.564
<v Speaker 3>so I noticed in your work that you've </v>
<v Speaker 3>looked at countries and states within </v>

149
00:08:57.331 --> 00:08:58.164
<v Speaker 3>countries and I think that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly true in the u s so tell us </v>

150
00:09:01.651 --> 00:09:03.210
<v Speaker 3>a little bit about what you found.</v>

151
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:04.913
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well with within the U S and again this </v>

152
00:09:07.331 --> 00:09:08.164
<v Speaker 4>has been done by sociologists for some </v>
<v Speaker 4>time within the u s and cross </v>

153
00:09:11.581 --> 00:09:13.040
<v Speaker 4>nationally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

154
00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.810
<v Speaker 4>the Gini Coefficient is a very good </v>
<v Speaker 4>predictor of homicide.</v>

155
00:09:16.811 --> 00:09:21.190
<v Speaker 4>The correlation tends to be on the order</v>
<v Speaker 4>of 0.7 in many studies,</v>

156
00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:22.053
<v Speaker 4>which means that the variants in either </v>
<v Speaker 4>measure 50% of it could be a count of </v>

157
00:09:26.891 --> 00:09:27.724
<v Speaker 4>four by no variability.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the other measure when I'm saying </v>

158
00:09:30.101 --> 00:09:32.050
<v Speaker 4>between homicide and income and </v>
<v Speaker 4>equality,</v>

159
00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:36.150
<v Speaker 4>and actually it even works on a </v>
<v Speaker 4>neighborhood level.</v>

160
00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:37.013
<v Speaker 4>My late wife Margaux and I publish some </v>
<v Speaker 4>analyses in Chicago that showed they </v>

161
00:09:39.981 --> 00:09:42.580
<v Speaker 4>didn't cut any quality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wasn't very strong predictor of homicide</v>

162
00:09:42.581 --> 00:09:45.190
<v Speaker 4>rates across neighborhoods within </v>
<v Speaker 4>Chicago.</v>

163
00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:46.650
<v Speaker 4>Tell us a little bit about</v>

164
00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:47.733
<v Speaker 3>you did in Chicago cause that that </v>
<v Speaker 3>research is extremely interesting and </v>

165
00:09:50.291 --> 00:09:51.220
<v Speaker 3>also when you did it.</v>

166
00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:53.660
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's see.</v>

167
00:09:53.661 --> 00:09:54.494
<v Speaker 4>We did our work in Chicago in the early </v>
<v Speaker 4>nineties and at that time Chicago had a </v>

168
00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:03.980
<v Speaker 4>very high homicide rate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not the worst in the United States,</v>

169
00:10:03.981 --> 00:10:04.814
<v Speaker 4>but one of the worst in the United </v>
<v Speaker 4>States and in fact have more homicides </v>

170
00:10:07.251 --> 00:10:08.870
<v Speaker 4>every year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the whole of Canada,</v>

171
00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:13.340
<v Speaker 4>which makes it a substantial enough </v>
<v Speaker 4>phenomenon that you can sort of look for</v>

172
00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:18.050
<v Speaker 4>causal factors or correlates without a </v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of stochastic noise.</v>

173
00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:19.280
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

174
00:10:19.281 --> 00:10:20.114
<v Speaker 4>Chicago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chicago is divided up into some 77 I </v>

175
00:10:22.911 --> 00:10:25.070
<v Speaker 4>believe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>neighborhoods by,</v>

176
00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:26.863
<v Speaker 4>there's a longstanding tradition of </v>
<v Speaker 4>urban sociology in Chicago and there's </v>

177
00:10:29.661 --> 00:10:30.494
<v Speaker 4>these sort of well recognized 77 </v>
<v Speaker 4>neighborhoods in any way for these </v>

178
00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:35.023
<v Speaker 4>neighborhoods.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were able to amass a variety of </v>

179
00:10:38.331 --> 00:10:40.820
<v Speaker 4>neighborhoods,</v>
<v Speaker 4>specific information including an income</v>

180
00:10:40.821 --> 00:10:44.440
<v Speaker 4>distributions on homicides and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

181
00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:45.403
<v Speaker 4>working with the Chicago police who were</v>
<v Speaker 4>collaborators in some of this work and </v>

182
00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:51.080
<v Speaker 4>Margo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

183
00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:52.513
<v Speaker 4>went to the Illinois Department of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Health to try and get information on </v>

184
00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:57.883
<v Speaker 4>other death rates and birth rates and </v>
<v Speaker 4>demographic structure of each of the </v>

185
00:11:02.151 --> 00:11:02.984
<v Speaker 4>neighborhoods.</v>

186
00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:07.190
<v Speaker 4>And she wanted to compute the life </v>
<v Speaker 4>expectancy because the idea that she had</v>

187
00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:08.383
<v Speaker 4>was the local life expectancy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would he affect the extent to which </v>

188
00:11:11.331 --> 00:11:16.331
<v Speaker 4>people were willing to sort of escalate </v>
<v Speaker 4>dangerously in competitive situations in</v>

189
00:11:17.571 --> 00:11:18.404
<v Speaker 4>competitive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that was our construal of what most </v>

190
00:11:20.751 --> 00:11:21.584
<v Speaker 4>homicides in Chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're about where guys killing each </v>

191
00:11:24.141 --> 00:11:27.050
<v Speaker 4>other when dissed embars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

192
00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.033
<v Speaker 4>circumstances in which there is some </v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of competition and it gets </v>

193
00:11:30.861 --> 00:11:34.130
<v Speaker 4>dangerous and are our basic idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They are.</v>

194
00:11:34.131 --> 00:11:38.350
<v Speaker 4>And elsewhere has been that a lot of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>variability in homicide rates,</v>

195
00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:41.690
<v Speaker 4>the most violent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>volatile component of homicide rates has</v>

196
00:11:41.691 --> 00:11:44.150
<v Speaker 4>to do with this male male competition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And where,</v>

197
00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.073
<v Speaker 4>where I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when does it get dangerous and where or </v>

198
00:11:46.441 --> 00:11:51.441
<v Speaker 4>when does it sort of dampen down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And for Chicago Anyway,</v>

199
00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:54.820
<v Speaker 4>the Illinois Department of Health had </v>
<v Speaker 4>never,</v>

200
00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:59.170
<v Speaker 4>nobody had ever computed neighborhoods </v>
<v Speaker 4>specific life expectancy,</v>

201
00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:03.810
<v Speaker 4>but the data were available to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>age specific [inaudible] and sell.</v>

202
00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:04.653
<v Speaker 4>I was available to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so we computed a significant life </v>

203
00:12:06.971 --> 00:12:10.840
<v Speaker 4>expectancies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>income equality and many other variables</v>

204
00:12:10.841 --> 00:12:11.674
<v Speaker 4>that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>criminologists have considered relevant </v>

205
00:12:15.071 --> 00:12:18.130
<v Speaker 4>in past studies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>racial heterogeneity and blah,</v>

206
00:12:18.131 --> 00:12:18.964
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blah and tried to see what were your </v>

207
00:12:21.071 --> 00:12:21.904
<v Speaker 4>best predictor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So homicide and in that particular </v>

208
00:12:23.501 --> 00:12:25.720
<v Speaker 4>study,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everywhere else we've worked,</v>

209
00:12:25.721 --> 00:12:26.554
<v Speaker 4>we've mostly found incoming equality </v>
<v Speaker 4>would be number one in that particular </v>

210
00:12:30.101 --> 00:12:30.934
<v Speaker 4>study,</v>
<v Speaker 4>incoming equality was a very good </v>

211
00:12:32.531 --> 00:12:33.364
<v Speaker 4>predictor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the best predictor was male life </v>

212
00:12:35.951 --> 00:12:39.760
<v Speaker 4>expectancy at age,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at birth or an age 15.</v>

213
00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:42.940
<v Speaker 4>And in order to compute,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like of course you say homicide rates,</v>

214
00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:44.163
<v Speaker 4>homicide reduces male life expectancy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you have to remove homicides </v>

215
00:12:47.131 --> 00:12:52.060
<v Speaker 4>statistically as a cause of death and </v>
<v Speaker 4>say life expectancy net of the impact of</v>

216
00:12:52.061 --> 00:12:52.894
<v Speaker 4>homicide,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was our best predictor of homicide </v>

217
00:12:54.791 --> 00:12:55.624
<v Speaker 4>rates.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And life expectancy is very variable in </v>

218
00:12:57.791 --> 00:13:00.460
<v Speaker 4>the city of Chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I assume that other US cities,</v>

219
00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:01.563
<v Speaker 4>I mean the worst neighborhoods,</v>
<v Speaker 4>male life expectancy at birth was down </v>

220
00:13:04.271 --> 00:13:07.540
<v Speaker 4>in the 50s as bad as in the worst </v>
<v Speaker 4>countries in the world,</v>

221
00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:08.733
<v Speaker 4>in the best neighborhoods,</v>
<v Speaker 4>male life expectancy was up in the I </v>

222
00:13:11.511 --> 00:13:14.920
<v Speaker 4>think was over 80 or in the high </v>
<v Speaker 4>seventies in any case,</v>

223
00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:15.983
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>corresponding to what you might expect </v>

224
00:13:17.891 --> 00:13:21.010
<v Speaker 4>in Scandinavia are the places but the </v>
<v Speaker 4>best life expectancy in the world.</v>

225
00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:21.843
<v Speaker 4>So it was a huge range.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was our best predictor than if you </v>

226
00:13:24.341 --> 00:13:26.620
<v Speaker 4>try and do a multivariate analysis where</v>
<v Speaker 4>you look for,</v>

227
00:13:26.621 --> 00:13:27.454
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what else predicts some the residual </v>

228
00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:32.440
<v Speaker 4>variability and there wasn't much </v>
<v Speaker 4>research tool variability.</v>

229
00:13:32.441 --> 00:13:36.250
<v Speaker 4>The second best indeed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the only secondary predictor that seemed</v>

230
00:13:36.251 --> 00:13:37.084
<v Speaker 4>to be statistically significant was </v>
<v Speaker 4>income inequality across the </v>

231
00:13:39.941 --> 00:13:40.780
<v Speaker 4>neighborhoods.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was,</v>

232
00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:43.960
<v Speaker 4>that was the thrust of our,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our study in Chicago.</v>

233
00:13:43.961 --> 00:13:48.040
<v Speaker 4>And I got lots to see more work on life </v>
<v Speaker 4>expectancy as a predictor of violence,</v>

234
00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:49.870
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of a university.</v>

235
00:13:49.871 --> 00:13:51.470
<v Speaker 4>Take them all right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Y'All crib it all.</v>

236
00:13:51.471 --> 00:13:52.304
<v Speaker 4>And just mark,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've tried to do the same thing in </v>

237
00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:56.830
<v Speaker 4>Montreal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he felt that a Montreal,</v>

238
00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:58.113
<v Speaker 4>the difference in life expectancy for </v>
<v Speaker 4>men between the worst and the best </v>

239
00:14:00.701 --> 00:14:03.880
<v Speaker 4>neighborhoods was only six years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whereas Chicago,</v>

240
00:14:03.881 --> 00:14:05.800
<v Speaker 4>it was 24 years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

241
00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:08.500
<v Speaker 4>So what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you think accounted for the vast</v>

242
00:14:08.501 --> 00:14:11.460
<v Speaker 4>difference in life expectancy between </v>
<v Speaker 4>Chicago and Montreal?</v>

243
00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:15.580
<v Speaker 4>Was life expectancy itself associated </v>
<v Speaker 4>with income inequality?</v>

244
00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:17.231
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>

245
00:14:17.231 --> 00:14:18.064
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's part of the problem of </v>
<v Speaker 4>course in all this kind of research </v>

246
00:14:20.241 --> 00:14:22.000
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not experimental research.</v>

247
00:14:22.001 --> 00:14:22.834
<v Speaker 4>You don't control independent variables </v>
<v Speaker 4>and everything of potential interest is </v>

248
00:14:25.571 --> 00:14:27.670
<v Speaker 4>correlated with everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

249
00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:29.193
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>income inequality alone accounts for </v>

250
00:14:31.031 --> 00:14:34.480
<v Speaker 4>more than half the variance in homicide </v>
<v Speaker 4>rates across Chicago neighborhoods.</v>

251
00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:37.780
<v Speaker 4>So does life expectancy alone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

252
00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:40.930
<v Speaker 4>so does percent below the poverty line </v>
<v Speaker 4>alone.</v>

253
00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:42.190
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

254
00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:44.380
<v Speaker 4>like these things are all correlated </v>
<v Speaker 4>with each other.</v>

255
00:14:44.381 --> 00:14:48.160
<v Speaker 4>And so try to tease apart what's most </v>
<v Speaker 4>important is tricky.</v>

256
00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:49.383
<v Speaker 4>So the low life expectancy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chicago neighborhoods is not due to </v>

257
00:14:53.091 --> 00:14:54.170
<v Speaker 4>violence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A student,</v>

258
00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:55.093
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's too overwhelming lead to </v>

259
00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:58.890
<v Speaker 4>differential disease.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

260
00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.580
<v Speaker 4>in Chicago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

261
00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:04.200
<v Speaker 4>privatization of medicine in the U s was</v>
<v Speaker 4>so extremely tight.</v>

262
00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:05.113
<v Speaker 4>We were doing this research.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Emergency rooms in the worst </v>

263
00:15:08.481 --> 00:15:11.270
<v Speaker 4>neighborhoods in Chicago had closed down</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they got bankrupt.</v>

264
00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:12.353
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they didn't have enough money to remain </v>

265
00:15:13.611 --> 00:15:17.960
<v Speaker 4>open and therefore if you got stabbed or</v>
<v Speaker 4>shot in a bad neighborhood in Chicago,</v>

266
00:15:17.961 --> 00:15:18.794
<v Speaker 4>you had to be transported somewhere else</v>
<v Speaker 4>to try and keep you alive because there </v>

267
00:15:22.371 --> 00:15:23.540
<v Speaker 4>was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

268
00:15:23.541 --> 00:15:27.500
<v Speaker 4>the hospitals and shut their emergency </v>
<v Speaker 4>rooms or had shut down completely.</v>

269
00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:30.860
<v Speaker 4>So there's all sorts of factors that </v>
<v Speaker 4>contribute to a,</v>

270
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:33.620
<v Speaker 4>to differential death rates.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

271
00:15:33.621 --> 00:15:36.370
<v Speaker 4>kids in the worst neighborhood are </v>
<v Speaker 4>exposed to high levels of wed.</v>

272
00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:38.143
<v Speaker 4>There's some evidence that lead exposure</v>
<v Speaker 4>and childhoods is a big predictor of </v>

273
00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:44.480
<v Speaker 4>variability of life expectancy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

274
00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:45.553
<v Speaker 4>all kinds of internal diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were more susceptible to the </v>

275
00:15:49.011 --> 00:15:51.500
<v Speaker 4>effects of bad nutrition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were more susceptible to.</v>

276
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:56.590
<v Speaker 4>So if you divide causes of death and </v>
<v Speaker 4>just so called external causes,</v>

277
00:15:57.591 --> 00:15:58.424
<v Speaker 4>which basically means homicides,</v>
<v Speaker 4>suicides and accidents and internal </v>

278
00:16:01.971 --> 00:16:02.804
<v Speaker 4>causes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is more or less synonymous with </v>

279
00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:07.640
<v Speaker 4>what we ordinarily think of as disease </v>
<v Speaker 4>internal causes,</v>

280
00:16:07.641 --> 00:16:08.474
<v Speaker 4>we're still the biggest source of </v>
<v Speaker 4>differential mortality across </v>

281
00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:12.053
<v Speaker 4>neighborhoods.</v>

282
00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:13.653
<v Speaker 5>So you could make by the sounds of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could make a reasonable case that </v>

283
00:16:16.481 --> 00:16:20.350
<v Speaker 5>the same social safety net in Canada is </v>
<v Speaker 5>flattening out the bottom of the,</v>

284
00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:23.710
<v Speaker 5>of the income distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially the provision of healthcare.</v>

285
00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:25.060
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I also</v>

286
00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:28.380
<v Speaker 5>was informed a while back,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

287
00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:29.853
<v Speaker 5>that the rate of entrepreneurship in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Canada is actually higher than in than </v>

288
00:16:33.071 --> 00:16:33.904
<v Speaker 5>in the u s and part of the reason for </v>
<v Speaker 5>that is that because healthcare is </v>

289
00:16:36.491 --> 00:16:37.324
<v Speaker 5>provided,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people can take a risk of walking away </v>

290
00:16:39.251 --> 00:16:42.250
<v Speaker 5>from their jobs without putting their </v>
<v Speaker 5>family completely at risk.</v>

291
00:16:42.251 --> 00:16:43.084
<v Speaker 5>And so one of the perverse effects of </v>
<v Speaker 5>socialized medicine is that it elevates </v>

292
00:16:46.391 --> 00:16:49.780
<v Speaker 5>the rates of entrepreneurship.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I also wanted to mention,</v>

293
00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:50.350
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>

294
00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:54.240
<v Speaker 5>your work was absolutely striking to me </v>
<v Speaker 5>because of the effect sizes.</v>

295
00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:58.010
<v Speaker 5>Now for people who don't know about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

296
00:16:58.540 --> 00:16:59.373
<v Speaker 5>how to compare effects sizes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I should point out that you never see a </v>

297
00:17:02.021 --> 00:17:06.820
<v Speaker 5>correlation of 0.7 between any two </v>
<v Speaker 5>variables in the social sciences.</v>

298
00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:07.773
<v Speaker 5>So there's a guy named Hamp Hale who did</v>
<v Speaker 5>an empirical analysis of effect size </v>

299
00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:12.200
<v Speaker 5>comparisons,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

300
00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:14.950
<v Speaker 5>about four or five years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Might be longer than that now.</v>

301
00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:20.730
<v Speaker 5>And he concluded that 95% of social </v>
<v Speaker 5>science studies had a effect size of 0.5</v>

302
00:17:21.791 --> 00:17:22.624
<v Speaker 5>or less.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so to see a correlation of 0.7 is </v>

303
00:17:25.061 --> 00:17:28.630
<v Speaker 5>absolutely overwhelming when you also </v>
<v Speaker 5>take into account that measurement error</v>

304
00:17:28.631 --> 00:17:32.320
<v Speaker 5>is decreasing the potency of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>relationship to some degree.</v>

305
00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:33.070
<v Speaker 5>So that's,</v>

306
00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:35.100
<v Speaker 4>and when you take into account that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

307
00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:36.053
<v Speaker 4>that those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that 0.5 represents studies that were </v>

308
00:17:39.151 --> 00:17:40.950
<v Speaker 4>published because they got something.</v>

309
00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:42.410
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>

310
00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:43.370
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

311
00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:44.443
<v Speaker 5>so 0.7 it's absolutely overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've never seen effect sizes that big </v>

312
00:17:48.291 --> 00:17:51.810
<v Speaker 5>between two variables of interest in any</v>
<v Speaker 5>other domain that I can recall.</v>

313
00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:54.240
<v Speaker 5>And then the other thing that's worth </v>
<v Speaker 5>pointing out,</v>

314
00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:56.130
<v Speaker 5>and we can talk about this a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 5>too,</v>

315
00:17:56.131 --> 00:17:59.700
<v Speaker 5>is the other thing that's so radical </v>
<v Speaker 5>about your research is that it,</v>

316
00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:01.290
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this,</v>

317
00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:02.153
<v Speaker 5>this what emerges out of the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>out of the manner in which the Gini </v>

318
00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:06.143
<v Speaker 5>Coefficient is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is calculated because it's only a </v>

319
00:18:08.281 --> 00:18:10.440
<v Speaker 5>measure of relative poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

320
00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:12.680
<v Speaker 5>and it's the predictor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You,</v>

321
00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:13.533
<v Speaker 5>you also generate it data indicating </v>
<v Speaker 5>that places where everyone was </v>

322
00:18:17.461 --> 00:18:21.960
<v Speaker 5>relatively poor or say relatively </v>
<v Speaker 5>working class like North Dakota and some</v>

323
00:18:21.961 --> 00:18:22.794
<v Speaker 5>of the Canadian provinces had very low </v>
<v Speaker 5>homicide rates and also places where </v>

324
00:18:26.911 --> 00:18:28.740
<v Speaker 5>everyone was rich.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

325
00:18:28.741 --> 00:18:29.574
<v Speaker 5>So to rate reiterate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what you're seeing is that what's </v>

326
00:18:31.621 --> 00:18:35.530
<v Speaker 5>driving male homicide is the existence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And for,</v>

327
00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:37.050
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>correct me if I'm wrong,</v>

328
00:18:37.051 --> 00:18:37.884
<v Speaker 5>the existence of a steep economic </v>
<v Speaker 5>dominance hierarchy that makes it </v>

329
00:18:41.911 --> 00:18:42.744
<v Speaker 5>difficult for the young men to obtain </v>
<v Speaker 5>status through what you might describe </v>

330
00:18:46.591 --> 00:18:49.110
<v Speaker 5>as conventional and socially productive </v>
<v Speaker 5>means.</v>

331
00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:53.340
<v Speaker 5>And so instead they turned to violence </v>
<v Speaker 5>as a means of establishing status.</v>

332
00:18:53.341 --> 00:18:54.174
<v Speaker 5>And most of that's within race and </v>
<v Speaker 5>between young men jockeying for </v>

333
00:18:57.661 --> 00:18:59.580
<v Speaker 5>position.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that all correct?</v>

334
00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:00.341
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

335
00:19:00.341 --> 00:19:02.880
<v Speaker 4>I think that's a pretty fair </v>
<v Speaker 4>characterization.</v>

336
00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:04.050
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

337
00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:05.820
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's worth stressing.</v>

338
00:19:05.821 --> 00:19:06.654
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That income inequality is in principle </v>

339
00:19:08.461 --> 00:19:09.294
<v Speaker 4>and in practice dissociable from just </v>
<v Speaker 4>averaging cub or 4% below the poverty </v>

340
00:19:13.891 --> 00:19:17.700
<v Speaker 4>line or other measures of cell called </v>
<v Speaker 4>absolute a deprivation,</v>

341
00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:20.200
<v Speaker 4>they're often correlated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

342
00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:23.280
<v Speaker 4>income inequality across a certain set </v>
<v Speaker 4>of jurisdictions,</v>

343
00:19:23.281 --> 00:19:26.050
<v Speaker 4>maybe fairly strongly correlated with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

344
00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:28.320
<v Speaker 4>the percent below the poverty line.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For example.</v>

345
00:19:28.321 --> 00:19:31.830
<v Speaker 4>It'd be surprising if it was not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should correlated,</v>

346
00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:32.910
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

347
00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:34.710
<v Speaker 4>but they're not necessarily as you said.</v>

348
00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:37.210
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you demonstrate it or you were one of</v>

349
00:19:37.211 --> 00:19:39.040
<v Speaker 5>the first people to demonstrate where </v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

350
00:19:39.041 --> 00:19:39.874
<v Speaker 5>the first,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in fact maybe that it wasn't poverty </v>

351
00:19:41.801 --> 00:19:42.634
<v Speaker 5>that was causing this kind of crime.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was relative poverty and that that </v>

352
00:19:45.071 --> 00:19:47.320
<v Speaker 5>changes the interpretation of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>situation.</v>

353
00:19:47.321 --> 00:19:48.550
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dramatically.</v>

354
00:19:48.551 --> 00:19:49.384
<v Speaker 5>So tell us a little bit about why you </v>
<v Speaker 5>think that males are competing in this </v>

355
00:19:54.041 --> 00:19:56.350
<v Speaker 5>deadly manner.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's driving that behavior?</v>

356
00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:59.530
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very interesting,</v>

357
00:19:59.531 --> 00:20:00.364
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think men are sensitive to or </v>

358
00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:04.173
<v Speaker 4>interested in relative position status </v>
<v Speaker 4>of maintaining face in competitive </v>

359
00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:12.460
<v Speaker 4>billions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in a sense,</v>

360
00:20:12.461 --> 00:20:14.840
<v Speaker 4>all videos are a bit competitive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

361
00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:15.933
<v Speaker 4>and the willingness to use bio,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's partly s can be thought of as kind </v>

362
00:20:20.651 --> 00:20:25.651
<v Speaker 4>of a disdain for the future or I walked </v>
<v Speaker 4>by now,</v>

363
00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:26.693
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm willing to do something that </v>

364
00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:28.863
<v Speaker 4>threatens by wife,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like escalate and competition are not </v>

365
00:20:31.571 --> 00:20:32.404
<v Speaker 4>backed out or not walk away from an </v>
<v Speaker 4>insult because I'm thinking very short </v>

366
00:20:38.471 --> 00:20:43.471
<v Speaker 4>term the rewards for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for being passive.</v>

367
00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:45.730
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're,</v>

368
00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:49.000
<v Speaker 4>if you're a nice of Prosperous </v>
<v Speaker 4>University,</v>

369
00:20:49.001 --> 00:20:52.870
<v Speaker 4>student of age 20,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have good life prospects,</v>

370
00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:57.010
<v Speaker 4>your chances for eventually becoming a </v>
<v Speaker 4>well paid,</v>

371
00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:58.013
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe people will laugh at this are </v>

372
00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:00.543
<v Speaker 4>still reasonably good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your chances for eventually burying are </v>

373
00:21:02.831 --> 00:21:06.580
<v Speaker 4>still reasonably good if you're the same</v>
<v Speaker 4>age guide to guy,</v>

374
00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:07.571
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

375
00:21:07.571 --> 00:21:08.404
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>urban ghetto with a 48% of the </v>

376
00:21:11.231 --> 00:21:11.890
<v Speaker 4>appointment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

377
00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:12.723
<v Speaker 4>Or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you have very much more Ed ed with </v>

378
00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:19.870
<v Speaker 4>uncertainty about the stability of </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever income you do get with,</v>

379
00:21:19.871 --> 00:21:20.704
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

380
00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:21.633
<v Speaker 4>the future of node,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you're more willing to take a risk </v>

381
00:21:25.361 --> 00:21:26.194
<v Speaker 4>now in the pursuit of status now and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>produce suit of sexual opportunity now </v>

382
00:21:30.661 --> 00:21:35.530
<v Speaker 4>in the pursuit of monetary rewards,</v>
<v Speaker 4>illegal or illicit now.</v>

383
00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:36.723
<v Speaker 4>And also the maintenance of face,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like social reputation is the one </v>

384
00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:42.063
<v Speaker 4>resource you've got.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you've got other resources you could </v>

385
00:21:45.281 --> 00:21:50.281
<v Speaker 4>walk away from threats or or</v>
<v Speaker 4>disrespect,</v>

386
00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:54.430
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>add and reap your rewards later.</v>

387
00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:55.533
<v Speaker 4>If social status is all you've got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it becomes an important thing to </v>

388
00:21:58.721 --> 00:21:59.554
<v Speaker 4>defend.</v>

389
00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:01.123
<v Speaker 5>So I read some research a while back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It looked at the relationship between </v>

390
00:22:04.701 --> 00:22:05.534
<v Speaker 5>socioeconomic status among men and </v>
<v Speaker 5>number of sexual partners and also </v>

391
00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:13.580
<v Speaker 5>socioeconomic status among women,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a number of sexual partners.</v>

392
00:22:13.581 --> 00:22:17.080
<v Speaker 5>And that's another domain where you see </v>
<v Speaker 5>these kinds of whopping correlations.</v>

393
00:22:17.081 --> 00:22:17.914
<v Speaker 5>So the correlation between socioeconomic</v>
<v Speaker 5>status for men and number of available </v>

394
00:22:22.431 --> 00:22:27.431
<v Speaker 5>sexual partners is about 0.6 or 0.7.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whereas for women it's negative 0.12 and</v>

395
00:22:29.001 --> 00:22:29.834
<v Speaker 5>so do you think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so do you think that it's reasonable to </v>

396
00:22:33.381 --> 00:22:34.214
<v Speaker 5>assume that either at the phylogenetic </v>
<v Speaker 5>level level or the on a genetic level </v>

397
00:22:37.971 --> 00:22:38.804
<v Speaker 5>leave either evolutionarily speaking or </v>
<v Speaker 5>even as a consequence of rational </v>

398
00:22:41.571 --> 00:22:45.290
<v Speaker 5>calculation that part of the reason that</v>
<v Speaker 5>men are perhaps the main reason that men</v>

399
00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:46.483
<v Speaker 5>are engaging in these status </v>
<v Speaker 5>competitions is because of female hyper </v>

400
00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:51.440
<v Speaker 5>gummy?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that a reasonable,</v>

401
00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:53.330
<v Speaker 5>is that a reasonable hypothesis?</v>

402
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:56.940
<v Speaker 4>Hypercarbia and as you say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>set up simple access.</v>

403
00:22:56.941 --> 00:22:58.020
<v Speaker 4>I mean there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is</v>

404
00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:00.353
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the association that you mentioned is </v>

405
00:23:02.821 --> 00:23:03.654
<v Speaker 4>presumably a very longstanding one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is to say that bed ups with status </v>

406
00:23:06.961 --> 00:23:11.700
<v Speaker 4>et resources have had access to partners</v>
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>

407
00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:15.720
<v Speaker 4>And probably multiple partners </v>
<v Speaker 4>simultaneously or serially.</v>

408
00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:16.893
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to a degree that bed of lower status </v>

409
00:23:19.051 --> 00:23:19.884
<v Speaker 4>have dot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's high variates it eventual </v>

410
00:23:21.571 --> 00:23:26.220
<v Speaker 4>reproduction among males in mammals </v>
<v Speaker 4>generally.</v>

411
00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:27.083
<v Speaker 4>And although the situation is less </v>
<v Speaker 4>extreme and people that have been the </v>

412
00:23:30.291 --> 00:23:32.160
<v Speaker 4>other battles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the same is true for people.</v>

413
00:23:32.161 --> 00:23:32.994
<v Speaker 4>I mean what you say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have high variates compared to </v>

414
00:23:35.521 --> 00:23:36.061
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

415
00:23:36.061 --> 00:23:38.310
<v Speaker 4>high variates compared to women for </v>
<v Speaker 4>example,</v>

416
00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:41.550
<v Speaker 4>of the variability and eventual </v>
<v Speaker 4>reproductive success as well.</v>

417
00:23:41.551 --> 00:23:45.730
<v Speaker 4>Where for women than for men or husband.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now you say sexual to it,</v>

418
00:23:45.731 --> 00:23:46.564
<v Speaker 4>but I think that's exactly the right </v>
<v Speaker 4>level to be working out got in </v>

419
00:23:48.141 --> 00:23:48.974
<v Speaker 4>contemporary societies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the reason why that matters is </v>

420
00:23:53.271 --> 00:23:54.104
<v Speaker 4>because ancestrally that translated into</v>
<v Speaker 4>differential reproduction in a moderate </v>

421
00:23:57.810 --> 00:24:01.400
<v Speaker 4>environment of which you don't cut.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Perceptive technology is available,</v>

422
00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:03.810
<v Speaker 4>especially to women than,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

423
00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:06.380
<v Speaker 4>that that correlation may be broken </v>
<v Speaker 4>down.</v>

424
00:24:06.381 --> 00:24:11.270
<v Speaker 4>But the motives to seek sexual </v>
<v Speaker 4>opportunity,</v>

425
00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:12.980
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>remain relevant.</v>

426
00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:17.240
<v Speaker 5>So one of the things that I wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 5>talk to you about too,</v>

427
00:24:17.241 --> 00:24:18.380
<v Speaker 5>is to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you,</v>

428
00:24:18.381 --> 00:24:19.214
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you made a comment in your book about </v>

429
00:24:20.391 --> 00:24:21.224
<v Speaker 5>Adrian Rates and Adrian rains has </v>
<v Speaker 5>written a book recently about the </v>

430
00:24:24.441 --> 00:24:25.274
<v Speaker 5>biological predictors of criminality.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you make a strong case that in some </v>

431
00:24:30.591 --> 00:24:32.070
<v Speaker 5>sense the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

432
00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:32.993
<v Speaker 5>the turning to violence that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>characteristic of men in uncertain </v>

433
00:24:35.451 --> 00:24:40.160
<v Speaker 5>situations is rational because it </v>
<v Speaker 5>drives,</v>

434
00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:41.053
<v Speaker 5>it actually legitimately drive status </v>
<v Speaker 5>increase and that produces a variety of </v>

435
00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:45.823
<v Speaker 5>positive effects.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So in some sense it's a rational </v>

436
00:24:48.141 --> 00:24:51.590
<v Speaker 5>response to a radically uncertain </v>
<v Speaker 5>environment where competition is high.</v>

437
00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:56.180
<v Speaker 5>Now reigns would say no biological type </v>
<v Speaker 5>researchers they look at,</v>

438
00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:57.163
<v Speaker 5>they look more at the individual level </v>
<v Speaker 5>and conclude that it's individuals who </v>

439
00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:02.640
<v Speaker 5>have various forms of prefrontal damage </v>
<v Speaker 5>or,</v>

440
00:25:02.641 --> 00:25:03.474
<v Speaker 5>or characterological issues associated </v>
<v Speaker 5>with antisocial personality disorder </v>

441
00:25:08.151 --> 00:25:11.660
<v Speaker 5>that are more likely to engage in </v>
<v Speaker 5>violent acts.</v>

442
00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:13.490
<v Speaker 5>And you can track that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

443
00:25:13.491 --> 00:25:15.770
<v Speaker 5>Rashard Trombley has done some of this </v>
<v Speaker 5>work in Quebec.</v>

444
00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:17.233
<v Speaker 5>You can track the emergence of </v>
<v Speaker 5>aggression at an individual level all </v>

445
00:25:20.151 --> 00:25:20.984
<v Speaker 5>the way back to children at two years of</v>
<v Speaker 5>age because it turns out that children </v>

446
00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:26.570
<v Speaker 5>who are two are the most violent </v>
<v Speaker 5>children,</v>

447
00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:28.003
<v Speaker 5>particularly the boys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but mostly a subset of boys who who </v>

448
00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:35.210
<v Speaker 5>can't fight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hit and bite and steel at two,</v>

449
00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:38.600
<v Speaker 5>most of whom are socialized by the age </v>
<v Speaker 5>of four,</v>

450
00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:42.440
<v Speaker 5>but a subset of whom are not socialized </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then they become,</v>

451
00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:44.860
<v Speaker 5>they're more likely to become the </v>
<v Speaker 5>lifetime offenders.</v>

452
00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:46.003
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so what I'm wondering is maybe you </v>

453
00:25:47.481 --> 00:25:52.220
<v Speaker 5>can reconcile the difference between the</v>
<v Speaker 5>two research streams like this.</v>

454
00:25:52.221 --> 00:25:53.054
<v Speaker 5>Imagine that as the economic gradient </v>
<v Speaker 5>increases and the dominance hierarchy </v>

455
00:25:56.991 --> 00:26:01.520
<v Speaker 5>becomes steeper and steeper,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the men who are prone to be violent,</v>

456
00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:02.943
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's the disagreeable men that start to </v>

457
00:26:05.571 --> 00:26:06.404
<v Speaker 5>be violet first,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe ones that have an impulse control </v>

458
00:26:09.081 --> 00:26:11.330
<v Speaker 5>problem or that are character a </v>
<v Speaker 5>logically like,</v>

459
00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:12.193
<v Speaker 5>like the violent two year olds that are </v>
<v Speaker 5>character logically predisposed to be </v>

460
00:26:14.691 --> 00:26:15.524
<v Speaker 5>violent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It seems to me that those would be the </v>

461
00:26:16.791 --> 00:26:17.690
<v Speaker 5>ones that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

462
00:26:17.691 --> 00:26:22.100
<v Speaker 5>as the pressure increases,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those men who are more prone to violence</v>

463
00:26:22.101 --> 00:26:25.880
<v Speaker 5>for other reasons are going to be the </v>
<v Speaker 5>people who react with violence first.</v>

464
00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:28.190
<v Speaker 5>You think that's a reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 5>hypothesis?</v>

465
00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:29.413
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's a very reasonable </v>

466
00:26:29.991 --> 00:26:31.030
<v Speaker 4>hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

467
00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:36.020
<v Speaker 4>my objection to atria raids book was </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I think he vast,</v>

468
00:26:36.050 --> 00:26:36.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

469
00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:39.650
<v Speaker 4>there's definitely evidence that betty </v>
<v Speaker 4>kinds of,</v>

470
00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:40.583
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>violet criminal offenders have got </v>

471
00:26:42.351 --> 00:26:46.590
<v Speaker 4>something wrong with their braids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Eight Rehab Ray bloods to extrapolate to</v>

472
00:26:46.591 --> 00:26:49.010
<v Speaker 4>the conclusion that violent criminals I </v>
<v Speaker 4>did.</v>

473
00:26:49.011 --> 00:26:49.844
<v Speaker 4>Deep criminals in general have got </v>
<v Speaker 4>something broken about their braids and </v>

474
00:26:53.041 --> 00:26:56.700
<v Speaker 4>it's like criminality is pathological.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

475
00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:57.653
<v Speaker 4>criminality is not pathological.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People steal for cost benefit related </v>

476
00:27:03.991 --> 00:27:05.170
<v Speaker 4>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

477
00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:06.293
<v Speaker 4>the crime is a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you like God help us social </v>

478
00:27:12.181 --> 00:27:14.360
<v Speaker 4>construction in the sense that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

479
00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:19.320
<v Speaker 4>certain behaviors are criminalized by a </v>
<v Speaker 4>larger social group.</v>

480
00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:20.183
<v Speaker 4>It ordered to the turn up because self </v>
<v Speaker 4>interested individuals but otherwise </v>

481
00:27:23.881 --> 00:27:24.661
<v Speaker 4>pursued them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

482
00:27:24.661 --> 00:27:27.930
<v Speaker 4>how do you make people stop exploiting </v>
<v Speaker 4>others,</v>

483
00:27:27.931 --> 00:27:28.764
<v Speaker 4>stealing from others</v>
<v Speaker 4>by criminalizing those activities and </v>

484
00:27:32.831 --> 00:27:33.664
<v Speaker 4>imposing penalties.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know there's a rational choice </v>

485
00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:37.343
<v Speaker 4>of stream of theorizing within </v>
<v Speaker 4>criminology that that other people like </v>

486
00:27:41.681 --> 00:27:43.650
<v Speaker 4>Adrian Ray just dismiss out of head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

487
00:27:43.651 --> 00:27:46.740
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Criminal offenses are pathological.</v>

488
00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:50.430
<v Speaker 4>Yeah and I think that's silly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well it seems unnecessary</v>

489
00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:54.710
<v Speaker 5>because it is also difficult to make a </v>
<v Speaker 5>marriage between the two issues.</v>

490
00:27:54.711 --> 00:27:55.544
<v Speaker 5>Like one of the best predictors,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know I do research on individual </v>

491
00:27:58.311 --> 00:27:59.144
<v Speaker 5>differences in personality and the best </v>
<v Speaker 5>personality predictor of incarceration </v>

492
00:28:02.691 --> 00:28:03.524
<v Speaker 5>is low agreeableness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's one of the dimensions on which </v>

493
00:28:05.751 --> 00:28:10.751
<v Speaker 5>men and women differ the most.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so as you become more disagreeable,</v>

494
00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.790
<v Speaker 5>you become more self oriented I would </v>
<v Speaker 5>say.</v>

495
00:28:13.791 --> 00:28:14.624
<v Speaker 5>And that can push past the point where </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're so self interested that you're </v>

496
00:28:17.931 --> 00:28:18.764
<v Speaker 5>willing to prey on others.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so those are the guys that as well </v>

497
00:28:22.911 --> 00:28:25.400
<v Speaker 5>as the guys who lack impulse control,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those are the guys,</v>

498
00:28:25.401 --> 00:28:26.234
<v Speaker 5>the first guys to turn to violence,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say when the socioeconomic </v>

499
00:28:28.911 --> 00:28:29.744
<v Speaker 5>conditions become sufficiently unstable </v>
<v Speaker 5>so that a conscientious approach is not </v>

500
00:28:34.551 --> 00:28:35.384
<v Speaker 5>tenable.</v>

501
00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:38.010
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's at the marriage between that kind</v>

502
00:28:38.011 --> 00:28:38.844
<v Speaker 4>of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Keg Ed ed thinking about irrelevant so </v>

503
00:28:41.041 --> 00:28:45.750
<v Speaker 4>that any quality is that there's guys at</v>
<v Speaker 4>the top who are white,</v>

504
00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:46.613
<v Speaker 4>the violet people you described,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's people doing very well who are </v>

505
00:28:50.161 --> 00:28:50.994
<v Speaker 4>very happy to explain to others,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the costs of individual bio it </v>

506
00:28:54.691 --> 00:28:55.524
<v Speaker 4>action are high enough and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>opportunities to exploit other people </v>

507
00:28:58.231 --> 00:29:01.010
<v Speaker 4>through sight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she'll be just through your lawyers,</v>

508
00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:02.063
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>through whatever tactics are available </v>

509
00:29:05.041 --> 00:29:06.180
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

510
00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:07.193
<v Speaker 4>well he'll bullies are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are safe enough that they opt to behave </v>

511
00:29:11.611 --> 00:29:12.444
<v Speaker 4>with those directions,</v>

512
00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:14.053
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because they've gone to their longterm </v>

513
00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:16.533
<v Speaker 5>future is relatively stable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so that longterm planning and </v>

514
00:29:19.721 --> 00:29:23.350
<v Speaker 5>regulation of behavior actually play an </v>
<v Speaker 5>important economic role.</v>

515
00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:24.983
<v Speaker 4>Add,</v>
<v Speaker 4>add,</v>

516
00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:25.973
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then in the case of somebody like </v>

517
00:29:27.031 --> 00:29:28.560
<v Speaker 4>Donald Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

518
00:29:28.561 --> 00:29:29.394
<v Speaker 4>he looks like somebody who's suffering a</v>
<v Speaker 4>little bit of an impulse control </v>

519
00:29:31.711 --> 00:29:34.080
<v Speaker 4>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially sort of during the night when</v>

520
00:29:34.081 --> 00:29:37.890
<v Speaker 4>he wakes up and does his twitter account</v>
<v Speaker 4>is too close at head.</v>

521
00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:39.053
<v Speaker 4>But he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's rich enough to bully people at </v>

522
00:29:42.881 --> 00:29:45.610
<v Speaker 4>other ways that actually heads on </v>
<v Speaker 4>violence.</v>

523
00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:48.040
<v Speaker 4>Although come to think of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

524
00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:49.293
<v Speaker 4>the famous remark that he made during </v>
<v Speaker 4>the campaign about women suggests </v>

525
00:29:53.501 --> 00:29:54.440
<v Speaker 4>perhaps that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

526
00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:56.500
<v Speaker 4>it depends on your definition of heads </v>
<v Speaker 4>on violence,</v>

527
00:29:56.501 --> 00:29:57.700
<v Speaker 4>I guess that qualifies.</v>

528
00:29:58.120 --> 00:29:58.953
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

529
00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:00.133
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a very large body of research </v>

530
00:30:02.021 --> 00:30:05.320
<v Speaker 5>that indicates that alcohol is a major </v>
<v Speaker 5>contributor to criminality too,</v>

531
00:30:05.321 --> 00:30:07.720
<v Speaker 5>especially with regards to men.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

532
00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:09.033
<v Speaker 5>and so both 50% of people who were </v>
<v Speaker 5>murdered have a decent blood alcohol </v>

533
00:30:12.641 --> 00:30:13.474
<v Speaker 5>level and about 50% of murders.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think that's partly that stat is </v>

534
00:30:17.171 --> 00:30:18.004
<v Speaker 5>equal equalizes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think because much violence among men </v>

535
00:30:21.101 --> 00:30:21.934
<v Speaker 5>is exactly the sort that you described </v>
<v Speaker 5>where it's a status dispute and it's </v>

536
00:30:24.851 --> 00:30:27.370
<v Speaker 5>more or less a toss up who's going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>come out as a winner.</v>

537
00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:28.563
<v Speaker 5>But then I guess what's happening with </v>
<v Speaker 5>alcohol perhaps is that because it's a </v>

538
00:30:31.541 --> 00:30:36.541
<v Speaker 5>disinhibitor because it reduces anxiety </v>
<v Speaker 5>and anxiety is one of the suppressors of</v>

539
00:30:36.581 --> 00:30:40.270
<v Speaker 5>aggressive behavior that men who are </v>
<v Speaker 5>already on the edge,</v>

540
00:30:40.271 --> 00:30:41.104
<v Speaker 5>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because of the unstable environment and </v>

541
00:30:42.461 --> 00:30:43.294
<v Speaker 5>the steep dominance arc,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're also more likely lose control </v>

542
00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:46.533
<v Speaker 5>when they're drinking.</v>

543
00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:47.703
<v Speaker 5>And maybe that's also fuel.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is something to that I'm curious </v>

544
00:30:49.781 --> 00:30:50.560
<v Speaker 5>about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

545
00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:52.930
<v Speaker 5>you can think about it as a rational </v>
<v Speaker 5>calculation,</v>

546
00:30:52.931 --> 00:30:55.810
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm also curious about the degree to</v>

547
00:30:55.811 --> 00:30:58.900
<v Speaker 5>which it's fueled by emergent negative </v>
<v Speaker 5>emotions.</v>

548
00:30:58.901 --> 00:30:59.734
<v Speaker 5>So it's easy for people who are in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>steep dominance hierarchies to regard </v>

549
00:31:05.471 --> 00:31:06.304
<v Speaker 5>this system as unfair and to become </v>
<v Speaker 5>resentful and angry about it as perhaps </v>

550
00:31:10.151 --> 00:31:10.984
<v Speaker 5>they should be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not suggesting that that's </v>

551
00:31:12.281 --> 00:31:13.114
<v Speaker 5>necessarily an irrational response,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it seems that if the anger is </v>

552
00:31:17.531 --> 00:31:18.364
<v Speaker 5>simmering underneath the surface,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that it's waiting in some sense for an </v>

553
00:31:21.581 --> 00:31:26.480
<v Speaker 5>opportunity to break free and alcohol in</v>
<v Speaker 5>a bar or at home perhaps provides that,</v>

554
00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:27.910
<v Speaker 5>that that route.</v>

555
00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:32.180
<v Speaker 4>What you say makes evidence says to be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I made a boat,</v>

556
00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:33.393
<v Speaker 4>it's probably worth injecting a bit of a</v>
<v Speaker 4>caution about the word rationality </v>

557
00:31:36.851 --> 00:31:38.470
<v Speaker 4>generally well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but talks about,</v>

558
00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:40.900
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rationality and cry,</v>

559
00:31:40.901 --> 00:31:43.450
<v Speaker 4>but perhaps especially a confrontational</v>
<v Speaker 4>violence.</v>

560
00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:44.913
<v Speaker 4>The point is not that the person has </v>
<v Speaker 4>making good and carefully weigh </v>

561
00:31:48.081 --> 00:31:49.600
<v Speaker 4>decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

562
00:31:49.601 --> 00:31:50.434
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

563
00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:54.430
<v Speaker 4>emotions are the handmaid of what I </v>
<v Speaker 4>would call ecological rationality.</v>

564
00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:55.443
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they help you know how you should feel </v>

565
00:31:57.911 --> 00:32:00.130
<v Speaker 4>about certain things and how you should </v>
<v Speaker 4>react to them.</v>

566
00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:05.460
<v Speaker 4>And the rationality clay as more on clay</v>
<v Speaker 4>above this person gets riled up,</v>

567
00:32:07.090 --> 00:32:10.030
<v Speaker 4>resents x ad there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Eddie should it.</v>

568
00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:13.030
<v Speaker 4>There's good reason to get routed up at </v>
<v Speaker 4>breeze at x.</v>

569
00:32:13.031 --> 00:32:18.031
<v Speaker 4>But the fact that alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 4>perhaps this inhibits so that you know,</v>

570
00:32:19.151 --> 00:32:19.984
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the truly rational ballots between </v>

571
00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:26.080
<v Speaker 4>inhibitory and aggressive emotions is </v>
<v Speaker 4>altered.</v>

572
00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:30.280
<v Speaker 4>The idea that ration that alcohol </v>
<v Speaker 4>interferes with,</v>

573
00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:33.880
<v Speaker 4>with cognitive process,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is the point that people are start</v>

574
00:32:33.881 --> 00:32:35.980
<v Speaker 4>making stupid decisions when they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>drunk,</v>

575
00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:37.113
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>decide to get behind the wheel or </v>

576
00:32:38.231 --> 00:32:39.064
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think this plays very heavily yet to </v>

577
00:32:40.341 --> 00:32:41.174
<v Speaker 4>the reason why.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So Betty Hobbyist sides tend to happen </v>

578
00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:45.103
<v Speaker 4>in contexts like two drunks is </v>
<v Speaker 4>assaulting each other and stuff or you </v>

579
00:32:49.050 --> 00:32:49.883
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people who are somewhat under the </v>

580
00:32:51.771 --> 00:32:54.500
<v Speaker 4>influence of alcohol and insulting each </v>
<v Speaker 4>other rather than uh,</v>

581
00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:56.151
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with you,</v>

582
00:32:56.151 --> 00:32:56.984
<v Speaker 4>if you have more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you have more bed til wherewithal at </v>

583
00:33:00.231 --> 00:33:01.064
<v Speaker 4>the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you probably have better capacities to </v>

584
00:33:03.021 --> 00:33:07.340
<v Speaker 4>confuse date to diffuse dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 4>situations through,</v>

585
00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:08.750
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

586
00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:14.900
<v Speaker 4>ways that don't tail losing face by,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by being articulate.</v>

587
00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:18.380
<v Speaker 5>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

588
00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:19.713
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have other tools at your disposal </v>

589
00:33:20.931 --> 00:33:23.450
<v Speaker 5>rather than immediate recourse to your </v>
<v Speaker 5>fists.</v>

590
00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:24.710
<v Speaker 5>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

591
00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:29.480
<v Speaker 5>So if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>two and your Chicago Studies,</v>

592
00:33:29.481 --> 00:33:33.740
<v Speaker 5>this is one of the things that I found </v>
<v Speaker 5>particularly fascinating was you tracked</v>

593
00:33:33.741 --> 00:33:34.574
<v Speaker 5>the consequences of killing someone in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Chicago and the consequences were </v>

594
00:33:38.601 --> 00:33:40.430
<v Speaker 5>something of the following sort.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

595
00:33:40.431 --> 00:33:41.264
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you are likely to be charged with </v>

596
00:33:42.231 --> 00:33:43.064
<v Speaker 5>something like second degree murder.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It would be difficult for the police to </v>

597
00:33:46.281 --> 00:33:49.220
<v Speaker 5>find people to testify against you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if they did,</v>

598
00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:54.080
<v Speaker 5>generally what they would say is that it</v>
<v Speaker 5>was a two way altercation.</v>

599
00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:57.890
<v Speaker 5>And so in many cases you could plead </v>
<v Speaker 5>self defense.</v>

600
00:33:57.950 --> 00:33:58.783
<v Speaker 5>Often it didn't go before a jury because</v>
<v Speaker 5>the perpetrator plea bargain to down to </v>

601
00:34:02.811 --> 00:34:06.440
<v Speaker 5>manslaughter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The sentence was something on the,</v>

602
00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:07.393
<v Speaker 5>on the order of a couple of years and </v>
<v Speaker 5>people were generally out of prison in </v>

603
00:34:10.611 --> 00:34:11.444
<v Speaker 5>18 months with a substantial boost in </v>
<v Speaker 5>their social capital because now they </v>

604
00:34:14.841 --> 00:34:18.590
<v Speaker 5>were like dangerous sons of bitches not </v>
<v Speaker 5>to be messed with.</v>

605
00:34:18.591 --> 00:34:19.424
<v Speaker 5>And that was quite clear and also </v>
<v Speaker 5>perhaps also improved so to speak by </v>

606
00:34:22.791 --> 00:34:25.940
<v Speaker 5>their soldier and in prison is that is </v>
<v Speaker 5>if I got that right,</v>

607
00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:28.550
<v Speaker 4>except for what detail?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

608
00:34:28.910 --> 00:34:30.680
<v Speaker 4>actually it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our Chicago studies,</v>

609
00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:31.543
<v Speaker 4>we didn't have as good followup </v>
<v Speaker 4>information is what you're talking </v>

610
00:34:33.891 --> 00:34:34.400
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>

611
00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:35.233
<v Speaker 4>this was a early,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a piece of research in the city of </v>

612
00:34:36.981 --> 00:34:40.310
<v Speaker 4>Detroit that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that led to most of those findings.</v>

613
00:34:40.311 --> 00:34:41.630
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

614
00:34:41.631 --> 00:34:43.000
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

615
00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:45.320
<v Speaker 4>hardly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's interesting.</v>

616
00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:47.143
<v Speaker 4>We had a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we had a single year sample of cases of </v>

617
00:34:49.161 --> 00:34:54.161
<v Speaker 4>Detroit and there were I think 590 </v>
<v Speaker 4>homicide to Detroit that one year night,</v>

618
00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:58.060
<v Speaker 4>he'd 72 at which time Detroit did have </v>
<v Speaker 4>the highest homicide rate.</v>

619
00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:02.870
<v Speaker 4>The U s s a large majority of these are </v>
<v Speaker 4>bail bail dispute.</v>

620
00:35:02.871 --> 00:35:03.704
<v Speaker 4>So some sort of status disputes usually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but sometimes robberies and just as you </v>

621
00:35:09.891 --> 00:35:10.750
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

622
00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:15.170
<v Speaker 4>witnesses are unlikely to come forward </v>
<v Speaker 4>and have the prosecutors are stretched.</v>

623
00:35:15.171 --> 00:35:16.004
<v Speaker 4>They don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't have the resources that they </v>

624
00:35:18.801 --> 00:35:21.930
<v Speaker 4>would need to pursue every case.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so they,</v>

625
00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:24.920
<v Speaker 4>many cases were dismissed.</v>

626
00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:25.753
<v Speaker 4>I'd be not even prosecuted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>never buy play bark and something like </v>

627
00:35:27.831 --> 00:35:28.664
<v Speaker 4>approximately half of all male male </v>
<v Speaker 4>macho dispute homicides in Detroit that </v>

628
00:35:32.061 --> 00:35:34.760
<v Speaker 4>were solved.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're not prosecuted.</v>

629
00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:39.150
<v Speaker 4>And the expectation that there was a </v>
<v Speaker 4>self defense argument that bites,</v>

630
00:35:39.450 --> 00:35:39.951
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>

631
00:35:39.951 --> 00:35:42.930
<v Speaker 4>with the jury that of the half that were</v>
<v Speaker 4>prosecuted,</v>

632
00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:45.090
<v Speaker 4>almost all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

633
00:35:45.091 --> 00:35:48.810
<v Speaker 4>we're plea bargained down to bad </v>
<v Speaker 4>slaughter and the majority of them got a</v>

634
00:35:48.811 --> 00:35:49.740
<v Speaker 4>conviction,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

635
00:35:49.741 --> 00:35:52.920
<v Speaker 4>It's three years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>50% of the time off for good behavior.</v>

636
00:35:52.921 --> 00:35:53.754
<v Speaker 4>If you've behaved nicely,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you go to Jackson State Prison in </v>

637
00:35:56.041 --> 00:35:57.080
<v Speaker 4>Michigan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

638
00:35:57.150 --> 00:35:59.760
<v Speaker 4>18 months later you're back out on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>streets of Detroit.</v>

639
00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:02.400
<v Speaker 4>And Margo in particular was very </v>
<v Speaker 4>addressed.</v>

640
00:36:02.430 --> 00:36:03.263
<v Speaker 4>The question of whether killing in these</v>
<v Speaker 4>contexts might either to actually </v>

641
00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:08.280
<v Speaker 4>ultimately pay off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For guys,</v>

642
00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:13.440
<v Speaker 4>I tend to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the view that actually killing is that,</v>

643
00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:15.780
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's overstepping the bounds of utility,</v>

644
00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:16.830
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

645
00:36:16.830 --> 00:36:21.780
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that deadly threats are very selfish,</v>

646
00:36:21.781 --> 00:36:24.150
<v Speaker 4>rested and ineffectual,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but up again.</v>

647
00:36:24.410 --> 00:36:27.090
<v Speaker 4>But that actually following through onto</v>
<v Speaker 4>this may be the,</v>

648
00:36:27.091 --> 00:36:27.924
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

649
00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:28.793
<v Speaker 4>that nod functional tip of the iceberg,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I honestly don't know that that's </v>

650
00:36:31.861 --> 00:36:34.920
<v Speaker 4>true of these kinds of cases for them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for exactly this reason that,</v>

651
00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:35.933
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>guys get some social capital out of </v>

652
00:36:37.621 --> 00:36:39.330
<v Speaker 4>having done it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

653
00:36:39.331 --> 00:36:39.900
<v Speaker 4>hypothetically,</v>

654
00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:41.280
<v Speaker 5>will your mom,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Unimog ammo there,</v>

655
00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:45.710
<v Speaker 5>the tribe tribes in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in South America and South America,</v>

656
00:36:45.711 --> 00:36:47.060
<v Speaker 5>I believe are central,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's south.</v>

657
00:36:47.061 --> 00:36:48.360
<v Speaker 5>South America.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

658
00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:49.633
<v Speaker 5>The more war,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like men have a much higher rep </v>

659
00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:54.830
<v Speaker 5>production rate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the ones who've killed more.</v>

660
00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:55.611
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

661
00:36:55.611 --> 00:36:58.940
<v Speaker 5>obviously it isn't necessarily the case </v>
<v Speaker 5>that that's directly translatable,</v>

662
00:36:59.330 --> 00:37:02.810
<v Speaker 5>but there is some utility in being a </v>
<v Speaker 5>successful warrior.</v>

663
00:37:02.811 --> 00:37:03.644
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's actually one of the reasons that </v>

664
00:37:05.031 --> 00:37:08.000
<v Speaker 5>I think that capitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so to speak,</v>

665
00:37:08.001 --> 00:37:13.001
<v Speaker 5>is underappreciated because in a very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm speaking in a very specific sense is</v>

666
00:37:13.371 --> 00:37:14.204
<v Speaker 5>that there are disagreeable and wore </v>
<v Speaker 5>like men and some of them are very </v>

667
00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:19.963
<v Speaker 5>powerful in many ways,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not only physically but intellectually </v>

668
00:37:22.701 --> 00:37:26.930
<v Speaker 5>in character logically and and with with</v>
<v Speaker 5>great ambition.</v>

669
00:37:26.931 --> 00:37:27.764
<v Speaker 5>And the thing about capitalism is that </v>
<v Speaker 5>it enables them to wage war in a manner </v>

670
00:37:31.431 --> 00:37:32.264
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's not deadly and to become </v>

671
00:37:34.911 --> 00:37:38.150
<v Speaker 5>successful that way and and to channel </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're there,</v>

672
00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:42.170
<v Speaker 5>they're in intense competitive energy </v>
<v Speaker 5>into something that,</v>

673
00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:46.130
<v Speaker 5>well I think often is often for a social</v>
<v Speaker 5>good.</v>

674
00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:47.023
<v Speaker 5>Now it depends on how disagreeable the </v>
<v Speaker 5>person is and how selfish they are of </v>

675
00:37:49.611 --> 00:37:50.444
<v Speaker 5>course.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But people like that also tend to get </v>

676
00:37:51.531 --> 00:37:52.364
<v Speaker 5>punished in their,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in their cooperative interactions with </v>

677
00:37:54.741 --> 00:37:55.574
<v Speaker 5>other people.</v>

678
00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:57.970
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I partly agree,</v>

679
00:37:57.971 --> 00:38:01.930
<v Speaker 4>but I also feel that they offered toward</v>
<v Speaker 4>the social good is a bit hopeful.</v>

680
00:38:01.931 --> 00:38:02.764
<v Speaker 4>I bead up to the degree that people are </v>
<v Speaker 4>successful at a fairly unrestrained </v>

681
00:38:07.601 --> 00:38:08.434
<v Speaker 4>capitalist of competition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's usually at the expense of large </v>

682
00:38:12.161 --> 00:38:12.994
<v Speaker 4>numbers of people at the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it depends how unrestrained that </v>

683
00:38:16.901 --> 00:38:17.734
<v Speaker 4>capitalist competition is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was thinking of social good as in </v>

684
00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:22.960
<v Speaker 4>better than war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

685
00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:25.540
<v Speaker 4>Well better than war for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For sure.</v>

686
00:38:25.541 --> 00:38:26.374
<v Speaker 4>And sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and sometimes the way you succeed is by </v>

687
00:38:28.451 --> 00:38:32.320
<v Speaker 4>producing goods that actually make </v>
<v Speaker 4>people's lives better.</v>

688
00:38:32.570 --> 00:38:36.130
<v Speaker 4>Have no quarrel with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now I also</v>

689
00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:39.400
<v Speaker 5>wanted to ask you in the last couple of </v>
<v Speaker 5>chapters of your book,</v>

690
00:38:39.401 --> 00:38:42.460
<v Speaker 5>you turned to what I would regard as </v>
<v Speaker 5>more political issues.</v>

691
00:38:42.461 --> 00:38:45.790
<v Speaker 5>And so I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I w and I am,</v>

692
00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:46.743
<v Speaker 5>I'm very interested in inequality </v>
<v Speaker 5>because [inaudible] recapitulate for a </v>

693
00:38:50.170 --> 00:38:51.003
<v Speaker 5>minute.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So your work and the work of other </v>

694
00:38:51.461 --> 00:38:55.180
<v Speaker 5>people seems to indicate that as </v>
<v Speaker 5>inequality increases and dominance,</v>

695
00:38:55.181 --> 00:38:56.014
<v Speaker 5>hierarchies get steeper.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not only do young men get more violent </v>

696
00:38:58.781 --> 00:38:59.614
<v Speaker 5>and so society becomes less stable,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's also detrimental impacts on </v>

697
00:39:03.101 --> 00:39:05.520
<v Speaker 5>things like population health and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

698
00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:06.610
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

699
00:39:06.730 --> 00:39:07.563
<v Speaker 5>and that was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was documented quite nicely in the </v>

700
00:39:08.921 --> 00:39:11.080
<v Speaker 5>spirit level.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so I'm going to,</v>

701
00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:12.093
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>address a couple of criticisms of the </v>

702
00:39:13.691 --> 00:39:16.180
<v Speaker 5>research and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then I want to ask you,</v>

703
00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:21.040
<v Speaker 5>I want to have a discussion about your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're more prescriptive views,</v>

704
00:39:21.041 --> 00:39:22.450
<v Speaker 5>if that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

705
00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:23.433
<v Speaker 5>so the first issue,</v>
<v Speaker 5>someone just emailed me this a while </v>

706
00:39:25.811 --> 00:39:28.300
<v Speaker 5>back and when I was talking about </v>
<v Speaker 5>inequality and they said,</v>

707
00:39:28.301 --> 00:39:29.134
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what about places like China where the </v>

708
00:39:31.961 --> 00:39:32.794
<v Speaker 5>rates of inequality are starting to </v>
<v Speaker 5>skyrocket quite substantially and have </v>

709
00:39:35.501 --> 00:39:36.334
<v Speaker 5>been for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

710
00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:38.980
<v Speaker 5>several years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe it'd be several decades,</v>

711
00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:40.053
<v Speaker 5>yet the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the homicide rate doesn't seem to be </v>

712
00:39:42.341 --> 00:39:43.420
<v Speaker 5>budging much.</v>

713
00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:45.880
<v Speaker 5>And so I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well that was interesting.</v>

714
00:39:45.881 --> 00:39:48.660
<v Speaker 5>Maybe there's something different about </v>
<v Speaker 5>East Asian communities,</v>

715
00:39:48.661 --> 00:39:51.070
<v Speaker 5>so they tend to have very low crime </v>
<v Speaker 5>rates to begin with.</v>

716
00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:53.800
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like places like Japan for example,</v>

717
00:39:53.801 --> 00:39:54.634
<v Speaker 5>have very low crime rates.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so I'm wondering if what you think </v>

718
00:39:57.041 --> 00:39:57.874
<v Speaker 5>about that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that a reasonable criticism and how </v>

719
00:39:59.681 --> 00:40:00.550
<v Speaker 5>would you address it?</v>

720
00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.320
<v Speaker 4>Fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

721
00:40:03.321 --> 00:40:06.260
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think we could characterize,</v>

722
00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:10.310
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>orientals as less violent than box.</v>

723
00:40:10.311 --> 00:40:14.960
<v Speaker 4>It had holes or anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think history tells us otherwise that,</v>

724
00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:15.823
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's been a lot of severe and </v>

725
00:40:18.051 --> 00:40:20.780
<v Speaker 4>dangerous violence in Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in history,</v>

726
00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:21.673
<v Speaker 4>and did China in history.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how good data we have on </v>

727
00:40:25.791 --> 00:40:26.624
<v Speaker 4>Chinese homicide rates,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what I've seen is that they have </v>

728
00:40:28.371 --> 00:40:29.204
<v Speaker 4>been going up a bit lately,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but still the point that inequality has </v>

729
00:40:32.931 --> 00:40:33.764
<v Speaker 4>been skyrocketing going to be partly </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's an interesting question about </v>

730
00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:39.830
<v Speaker 4>time lags effect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some people,</v>

731
00:40:39.890 --> 00:40:40.640
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how,</v>

732
00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:41.473
<v Speaker 4>how sued is an increased inequality </v>
<v Speaker 4>effect going to play out as nasty </v>

733
00:40:47.211 --> 00:40:49.180
<v Speaker 4>interpersonal behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

734
00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:53.960
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people respond to inequality as a result</v>

735
00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:55.820
<v Speaker 4>of their lifetime experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

736
00:40:55.821 --> 00:40:56.654
<v Speaker 4>you were talking about young kids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll read very young children already </v>

737
00:40:59.691 --> 00:41:03.050
<v Speaker 4>being predictable and the extent to </v>
<v Speaker 4>which they're willing to,</v>

738
00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:04.363
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>use violet tactics against other people </v>

739
00:41:06.321 --> 00:41:07.400
<v Speaker 4>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

740
00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:11.360
<v Speaker 4>Asig three and four year olds could give</v>
<v Speaker 4>you some surprisingly good prediction of</v>

741
00:41:11.361 --> 00:41:12.530
<v Speaker 4>how they'll behave as adults.</v>

742
00:41:13.010 --> 00:41:13.843
<v Speaker 4>It's not inconceivable that the effects </v>
<v Speaker 4>of inequality even are influencing </v>

743
00:41:17.931 --> 00:41:22.040
<v Speaker 4>people's development prenatally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

744
00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:22.961
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the uterus,</v>

745
00:41:22.961 --> 00:41:23.794
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Environments that they experience as a </v>

746
00:41:24.921 --> 00:41:25.754
<v Speaker 4>function of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of inequitable environments and the </v>

747
00:41:27.771 --> 00:41:31.040
<v Speaker 4>stresses of fraught social comparisons </v>
<v Speaker 4>and so on that happened.</v>

748
00:41:31.041 --> 00:41:34.130
<v Speaker 4>And those environments could be </v>
<v Speaker 4>influencing at all life stages.</v>

749
00:41:34.131 --> 00:41:34.964
<v Speaker 4>So I don't think we have any strong </v>
<v Speaker 4>basis for expecting rapid changing </v>

750
00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:43.250
<v Speaker 4>inequality to be a company to the short </v>
<v Speaker 4>term by rapid change of violence.</v>

751
00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:47.120
<v Speaker 4>Of that said there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

752
00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:48.013
<v Speaker 4>it's certainly the case that there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>other things that matter and government </v>

753
00:41:52.071 --> 00:41:54.740
<v Speaker 4>controls are wad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

754
00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:55.633
<v Speaker 4>I think strong governments that </v>
<v Speaker 4>monopolize the legitimate use of </v>

755
00:41:59.931 --> 00:42:03.560
<v Speaker 4>violence can keep a lit of violence for </v>
<v Speaker 4>a long time.</v>

756
00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:04.730
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

757
00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:05.953
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

758
00:42:06.090 --> 00:42:10.030
<v Speaker 4>I would question whether they can keep </v>
<v Speaker 4>it played on it indefinitely,</v>

759
00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:12.380
<v Speaker 4>but they could keep a lid on it for a </v>
<v Speaker 4>long time if you,</v>

760
00:42:13.970 --> 00:42:18.970
<v Speaker 4>if you execute all</v>
<v Speaker 4>charged birders.</v>

761
00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:20.913
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I presumed that that would keep the </v>

762
00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:23.953
<v Speaker 4>incidents and birder doubt and not only </v>
<v Speaker 4>because those people could be </v>

763
00:42:26.571 --> 00:42:27.410
<v Speaker 4>recidivists.</v>

764
00:42:27.930 --> 00:42:28.501
<v Speaker 5>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

765
00:42:28.501 --> 00:42:31.650
<v Speaker 5>so there's an element of potentially of </v>
<v Speaker 5>authoritarian control.</v>

766
00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:33.780
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then the other gentleman did,</v>

767
00:42:33.781 --> 00:42:34.614
<v Speaker 5>I think is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is particularly interesting is the time </v>

768
00:42:36.961 --> 00:42:37.980
<v Speaker 5>lag argument.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

769
00:42:38.450 --> 00:42:43.450
<v Speaker 5>you don't know over what period of time </v>
<v Speaker 5>precisely inequality has it's pernicious</v>

770
00:42:43.591 --> 00:42:47.490
<v Speaker 5>effects and maybe it's not even the span</v>
<v Speaker 5>of one lifetime.</v>

771
00:42:48.110 --> 00:42:49.640
<v Speaker 5>It,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do.</v>

772
00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:53.370
<v Speaker 5>Do you have any data on that that that </v>
<v Speaker 5>would help help answer the question?</v>

773
00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:54.700
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did.</v>

774
00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:55.533
<v Speaker 4>I did make reference in my book killing </v>
<v Speaker 4>the competition to one sociological </v>

775
00:43:01.271 --> 00:43:03.490
<v Speaker 4>study that was looking at effects of </v>
<v Speaker 4>inequality.</v>

776
00:43:03.570 --> 00:43:04.403
<v Speaker 4>Ud mortality generally at the notion </v>
<v Speaker 4>that inequality affects mortality </v>

777
00:43:08.201 --> 00:43:10.870
<v Speaker 4>generally is mediated by what you were </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about,</v>

778
00:43:10.871 --> 00:43:12.640
<v Speaker 4>about health effects.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The idea that,</v>

779
00:43:13.230 --> 00:43:13.991
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

780
00:43:13.991 --> 00:43:14.824
<v Speaker 4>stresses of social comparisons produce </v>
<v Speaker 4>greater vulnerability to stress related </v>

781
00:43:19.991 --> 00:43:22.000
<v Speaker 4>diseases and Admin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fap,</v>

782
00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:23.013
<v Speaker 4>many diseases,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most diseases maybe even are stress </v>

783
00:43:25.650 --> 00:43:27.850
<v Speaker 4>related in their ultimate impacts on </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

784
00:43:28.090 --> 00:43:28.923
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so there's this one sociological study </v>

785
00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:31.893
<v Speaker 4>by a guy named Shag at Ohio state,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which sought effects of economic </v>

786
00:43:36.911 --> 00:43:37.744
<v Speaker 4>inequality of mortality in general,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and came to the conclusion that there </v>

787
00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:43.430
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the effects were lag,</v>

788
00:43:43.431 --> 00:43:44.264
<v Speaker 4>that the maximum impact on current </v>
<v Speaker 4>mortality was any quality seven years </v>

789
00:43:48.101 --> 00:43:50.020
<v Speaker 4>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which sounds kind of funny,</v>

790
00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:52.990
<v Speaker 4>but he had analyses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which seemed to show,</v>

791
00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:56.460
<v Speaker 4>and I'm a bit wary about the legitimacy </v>
<v Speaker 4>of these analyses,</v>

792
00:43:56.470 --> 00:43:57.303
<v Speaker 4>but they seem to me to show and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>seem to show to him that it equality of </v>

793
00:44:01.751 --> 00:44:06.010
<v Speaker 4>a few years ago affects the chats that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll die now.</v>

794
00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:08.050
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>net of the effects of,</v>

795
00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:09.680
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>age and sex and</v>

796
00:44:11.350 --> 00:44:12.183
<v Speaker 4>other predictors of mortality and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's sort of the Qbo and have </v>

797
00:44:16.211 --> 00:44:18.450
<v Speaker 4>consequences of betty years of Mrj,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

798
00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:21.370
<v Speaker 4>of past inequality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So seven years ago was the worst,</v>

799
00:44:21.371 --> 00:44:26.371
<v Speaker 4>but six and eight also battered </v>
<v Speaker 4>additively five years ago and died years</v>

800
00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:30.010
<v Speaker 4>ago also mattered additively 10 years </v>
<v Speaker 4>ago also mattered.</v>

801
00:44:30.250 --> 00:44:31.083
<v Speaker 4>So that how bad inequality was in your </v>
<v Speaker 4>past seems to affect your likelihood of </v>

802
00:44:35.371 --> 00:44:38.820
<v Speaker 4>dying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now the effects of violence have a,</v>

803
00:44:39.090 --> 00:44:39.923
<v Speaker 4>have a look dead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to figure out how you could </v>

804
00:44:41.701 --> 00:44:45.030
<v Speaker 4>get a decent enough data set to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

805
00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:47.160
<v Speaker 4>But I don't think it's impossible</v>

806
00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:50.253
<v Speaker 5>health effects.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I'm going to lay out an account of </v>

807
00:44:52.511 --> 00:44:53.344
<v Speaker 5>the men.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can tell me what you think about </v>

808
00:44:54.671 --> 00:44:55.391
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And all right,</v>

809
00:44:55.391 --> 00:44:57.940
<v Speaker 5>so you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

810
00:44:57.941 --> 00:44:58.774
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

811
00:44:58.930 --> 00:45:02.680
<v Speaker 5>you're brain is always trying to </v>
<v Speaker 5>calculate to some degree how good things</v>

812
00:45:02.681 --> 00:45:03.514
<v Speaker 5>are going for you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's an extraordinarily difficult </v>

813
00:45:05.201 --> 00:45:06.034
<v Speaker 5>calculation because life is uncertain </v>
<v Speaker 5>and ultimately uncertain and it's </v>

814
00:45:10.751 --> 00:45:14.800
<v Speaker 5>difficult to predict the future except </v>
<v Speaker 5>perhaps by using the past as a marker.</v>

815
00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:15.993
<v Speaker 5>And so what seems to happen is that our </v>
<v Speaker 5>nervous and our nervous systems are </v>

816
00:45:19.421 --> 00:45:20.254
<v Speaker 5>always interested in how prepared we </v>
<v Speaker 5>should be for emergency at any given </v>

817
00:45:23.231 --> 00:45:25.810
<v Speaker 5>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And as far as I can tell there,</v>

818
00:45:25.870 --> 00:45:28.240
<v Speaker 5>there are a number of ways that we </v>
<v Speaker 5>calibrate that.</v>

819
00:45:28.630 --> 00:45:32.140
<v Speaker 5>One is baseline levels of trait </v>
<v Speaker 5>neuroticism,</v>

820
00:45:32.530 --> 00:45:36.190
<v Speaker 5>so that sensitivity to anxiety and </v>
<v Speaker 5>uncertainty and emotional pain.</v>

821
00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:40.060
<v Speaker 5>And so you seem to be born roughly </v>
<v Speaker 5>speaking at a,</v>

822
00:45:40.350 --> 00:45:41.183
<v Speaker 5>at,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at an at your average level of </v>

823
00:45:43.511 --> 00:45:44.344
<v Speaker 5>neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which can vary substantially between </v>

824
00:45:45.851 --> 00:45:46.180
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

825
00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:50.620
<v Speaker 5>It can be also adjusted at puberty and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then the environment can move you in one</v>

826
00:45:50.621 --> 00:45:52.630
<v Speaker 5>direction or another.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So for example,</v>

827
00:45:52.631 --> 00:45:53.464
<v Speaker 5>if you have a highly anxious child and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you encourage them to go out and </v>

828
00:45:56.801 --> 00:45:57.634
<v Speaker 5>explore,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then you can move them towards the </v>

829
00:45:59.201 --> 00:46:02.290
<v Speaker 5>normal range of Jerry Kagan has </v>
<v Speaker 5>demonstrated that quite nicely.</v>

830
00:46:02.291 --> 00:46:03.310
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the first,</v>

831
00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:04.473
<v Speaker 5>the first estimate of how worried you </v>
<v Speaker 5>should be about the future is like </v>

832
00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:12.100
<v Speaker 5>genetic roll of the dice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some people will be born extraordinarily</v>

833
00:46:12.101 --> 00:46:13.570
<v Speaker 5>worried,</v>
<v Speaker 5>roughly speaking,</v>

834
00:46:13.571 --> 00:46:16.150
<v Speaker 5>and some people would be born hardly </v>
<v Speaker 5>worried at all.</v>

835
00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:17.193
<v Speaker 5>And then that can be modified by the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by the particulars of the social </v>

836
00:46:19.961 --> 00:46:21.400
<v Speaker 5>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

837
00:46:21.401 --> 00:46:22.234
<v Speaker 5>So then the next thing it seems to me to</v>
<v Speaker 5>be part of the calculation is </v>

838
00:46:25.750 --> 00:46:26.583
<v Speaker 5>comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How well are you doing compared to </v>

839
00:46:28.601 --> 00:46:29.434
<v Speaker 5>others?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That seems to be adjusted by mechanisms </v>

840
00:46:32.141 --> 00:46:36.100
<v Speaker 5>that associate perceived social status </v>
<v Speaker 5>with Serotonin,</v>

841
00:46:36.190 --> 00:46:40.630
<v Speaker 5>serotonergic activity such that as you </v>
<v Speaker 5>move up a dominance hierarchy,</v>

842
00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:41.693
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your serotonin levels rise so that your </v>

843
00:46:45.070 --> 00:46:45.903
<v Speaker 5>impulsivity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which would be partly sensitive </v>

844
00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:51.190
<v Speaker 5>sensitivity to immediate reward </v>
<v Speaker 5>declines.</v>

845
00:46:51.430 --> 00:46:54.580
<v Speaker 5>And so does your sensitivity to negative</v>
<v Speaker 5>emotion.</v>

846
00:46:55.270 --> 00:46:58.570
<v Speaker 5>Whereas if you plummet down to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>bottom of a hierarchy,</v>

847
00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:02.470
<v Speaker 5>you start to become more reward seeking </v>
<v Speaker 5>and also more anxious.</v>

848
00:47:02.471 --> 00:47:03.304
<v Speaker 5>And the reason for that more anxious and</v>
<v Speaker 5>is because the bottom of the dominance </v>

849
00:47:06.791 --> 00:47:07.624
<v Speaker 5>hierarchy actually is a more dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 5>place to be because you don't have </v>

850
00:47:10.121 --> 00:47:10.954
<v Speaker 5>access to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't have reliable access as reliable </v>

851
00:47:14.051 --> 00:47:18.000
<v Speaker 5>to shelter or food or mating resources </v>
<v Speaker 5>or healthcare.</v>

852
00:47:18.090 --> 00:47:19.930
<v Speaker 5>When you even see this in birds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

853
00:47:19.931 --> 00:47:21.070
<v Speaker 5>so if,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

854
00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:24.190
<v Speaker 5>a flu sweeps through an avian </v>
<v Speaker 5>population,</v>

855
00:47:24.550 --> 00:47:28.450
<v Speaker 5>it's the bedraggled birds at the bottom </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the dominance hierarchy to die first.</v>

856
00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:33.970
<v Speaker 5>And so then one more thing and then,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then I tell me what you think about this</v>

857
00:47:33.971 --> 00:47:34.804
<v Speaker 5>is that you have anything that seems to </v>
<v Speaker 5>happen is that as you plummet down the </v>

858
00:47:37.901 --> 00:47:38.734
<v Speaker 5>dominance hierarchy and your mind </v>
<v Speaker 5>settles into a more depressed and </v>

859
00:47:42.161 --> 00:47:42.994
<v Speaker 5>anxious state,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the levels of cortisol that you produce </v>

860
00:47:45.641 --> 00:47:46.474
<v Speaker 5>chronically rise and cortisol is a good </v>
<v Speaker 5>hormone for activating you but in but </v>

861
00:47:51.131 --> 00:47:53.050
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but in high doses,</v>

862
00:47:53.051 --> 00:47:55.960
<v Speaker 5>high continual doses,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it starts to produce brain damage,</v>

863
00:47:55.970 --> 00:47:56.803
<v Speaker 5>particularly in the hippocampus and it </v>
<v Speaker 5>also suppresses immunological function </v>

864
00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:04.360
<v Speaker 5>which makes you more susceptible to </v>
<v Speaker 5>infectious diseases.</v>

865
00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:05.463
<v Speaker 5>So that seems to be approximately the </v>
<v Speaker 5>process and so it's no wonder that </v>

866
00:48:07.901 --> 00:48:10.210
<v Speaker 5>people are trying to flee away from the </v>
<v Speaker 5>bottom up,</v>

867
00:48:10.211 --> 00:48:12.610
<v Speaker 5>the dominance hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Does that seem reasonable?</v>

868
00:48:13.740 --> 00:48:14.550
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Give me a,</v>

869
00:48:14.550 --> 00:48:15.960
<v Speaker 4>give me a moment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've got a cough,</v>

870
00:48:15.961 --> 00:48:17.190
<v Speaker 4>a blow by note.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

871
00:48:25.710 --> 00:48:30.710
<v Speaker 4>Hay fever season in southern Ontario.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

872
00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:33.113
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wish I were a better behavioral </v>

873
00:48:34.201 --> 00:48:35.034
<v Speaker 4>endocrinologist and a do a bit more with</v>
<v Speaker 4>more expert in some of the processes </v>

874
00:48:40.411 --> 00:48:41.244
<v Speaker 4>that you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but a lot of that makes sense to be the </v>

875
00:48:44.130 --> 00:48:46.590
<v Speaker 4>fraught social comparisons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

876
00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:51.010
<v Speaker 4>the evidence certainly is that it's more</v>
<v Speaker 4>stressful to be low.</v>

877
00:48:51.020 --> 00:48:52.500
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can you bet a high rank Kagan,</v>

878
00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:56.880
<v Speaker 4>we've had a little myth that all hot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>big,</v>

879
00:48:56.881 --> 00:48:59.620
<v Speaker 4>a very high rank puts all this burden of</v>
<v Speaker 4>decision making.</v>

880
00:48:59.621 --> 00:49:01.350
<v Speaker 4>He got you and that's terribly </v>
<v Speaker 4>stressful.</v>

881
00:49:01.351 --> 00:49:03.630
<v Speaker 4>It makes you vulnerable to heart attack </v>
<v Speaker 4>and Blah Blah Blah.</v>

882
00:49:04.170 --> 00:49:06.690
<v Speaker 4>And the day to say the opposite,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the data say that's not true.</v>

883
00:49:06.691 --> 00:49:10.890
<v Speaker 4>The more power and status if you like </v>
<v Speaker 4>decision making authority,</v>

884
00:49:10.891 --> 00:49:11.724
<v Speaker 4>you have the less vulnerable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you seem to be distressed related </v>

885
00:49:14.641 --> 00:49:16.630
<v Speaker 4>diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>

886
00:49:17.450 --> 00:49:19.530
<v Speaker 4>a lot of what you're saying makes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>makes evident sense to me.</v>

887
00:49:19.530 --> 00:49:21.960
<v Speaker 4>Then the developmental story that you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>telling.</v>

888
00:49:21.961 --> 00:49:22.794
<v Speaker 4>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

889
00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:26.520
<v Speaker 4>I think it's right that people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

890
00:49:26.650 --> 00:49:31.650
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how important the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>throw up the genetic diocese.</v>

891
00:49:31.831 --> 00:49:35.010
<v Speaker 4>I think it's an extremely interesting </v>
<v Speaker 4>puzzle,</v>

892
00:49:35.011 --> 00:49:35.844
<v Speaker 4>evolutionarily.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why there's is much heritable genetic </v>

893
00:49:38.761 --> 00:49:42.570
<v Speaker 4>variability in CBE.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Equally important domains as there is,</v>

894
00:49:42.810 --> 00:49:44.790
<v Speaker 4>and I'm not convinced anybody has,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

895
00:49:44.810 --> 00:49:46.980
<v Speaker 4>real really understands what bond you </v>
<v Speaker 4>weights,</v>

896
00:49:46.981 --> 00:49:49.230
<v Speaker 4>how much variability there is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But any case,</v>

897
00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:52.380
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that things are adjustable,</v>

898
00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:57.500
<v Speaker 4>it responds to what you encounter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And and a response to social status,</v>

899
00:49:58.111 --> 00:49:58.944
<v Speaker 4>perceived social status of responses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>social comparisons makes evident sense </v>

900
00:50:03.451 --> 00:50:04.284
<v Speaker 4>to me and again I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know enough about the putative </v>

901
00:50:10.381 --> 00:50:11.214
<v Speaker 4>damaging affects of excessively </v>
<v Speaker 4>prolonged exposure to say high cortisol </v>

902
00:50:16.981 --> 00:50:17.814
<v Speaker 4>levels to be sure whether there isn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>still sub adaptation sub actual </v>

903
00:50:24.660 --> 00:50:29.660
<v Speaker 4>functionality to the response to long </v>
<v Speaker 4>term exposure lurking beneath the sea.</v>

904
00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:30.933
<v Speaker 4>Big breakdown in the system because it </v>
<v Speaker 4>just seems to me that sort of a </v>

905
00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:36.290
<v Speaker 4>Darwinian,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not evolutionary.</v>

906
00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:39.410
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>social scientists said psychiatrists and</v>

907
00:50:39.411 --> 00:50:44.411
<v Speaker 4>psychologists have been too quick too</v>
<v Speaker 4>a soup pathology when they see states of</v>

908
00:50:48.241 --> 00:50:51.300
<v Speaker 4>affairs that do a deed have damaging </v>
<v Speaker 4>consequences,</v>

909
00:50:51.301 --> 00:50:54.130
<v Speaker 4>but they had subbed nevertheless have </v>
<v Speaker 4>some utility.</v>

910
00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:55.940
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wish I do a little more about,</v>

911
00:50:56.420 --> 00:50:57.253
<v Speaker 5>I think both the low serotonin and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>high cortisol levels are interesting in </v>

912
00:51:00.171 --> 00:51:01.004
<v Speaker 5>that regard because what does happen is </v>
<v Speaker 5>the combination of those two things </v>

913
00:51:04.371 --> 00:51:09.371
<v Speaker 5>makes you a more impulsive and be more </v>
<v Speaker 5>prepared for emergency action.</v>

914
00:51:10.550 --> 00:51:13.430
<v Speaker 5>Both of those things are very useful in </v>
<v Speaker 5>an uncertain environment.</v>

915
00:51:14.130 --> 00:51:14.963
<v Speaker 5>Detrimental.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The detrimental consequences seem to </v>

916
00:51:17.211 --> 00:51:19.640
<v Speaker 5>occur as a consequence of prolonged </v>
<v Speaker 5>overload.</v>

917
00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:20.503
<v Speaker 5>Is that because your body is utilizing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>imagine what your body is doing is </v>

918
00:51:24.621 --> 00:51:25.454
<v Speaker 5>utilizing more units of resource per </v>
<v Speaker 5>moment of time because of the necessity </v>

919
00:51:30.111 --> 00:51:30.944
<v Speaker 5>for preparation for unexpected events.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that can become physiologically </v>

920
00:51:34.641 --> 00:51:37.270
<v Speaker 5>exhausting in the long run.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I think it,</v>

921
00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:39.090
<v Speaker 5>it does,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

922
00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:40.353
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it seems to me that those biochemical </v>

923
00:51:42.261 --> 00:51:47.261
<v Speaker 5>effects do underlie the sort of adaptive</v>
<v Speaker 5>responses that you described except that</v>

924
00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:51.410
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>too much is too much and if it's hard to</v>

925
00:51:51.411 --> 00:51:52.244
<v Speaker 5>live at the bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what that means is you age faster and </v>

926
00:51:53.991 --> 00:51:57.800
<v Speaker 5>you don't live as long and you also have</v>
<v Speaker 5>higher susceptibility to disease.</v>

927
00:51:57.890 --> 00:51:58.723
<v Speaker 5>And maybe in some sense that's the price</v>
<v Speaker 5>you pay for the adaptive impulsivity </v>

928
00:52:02.370 --> 00:52:06.950
<v Speaker 5>that's also necessary to give you a </v>
<v Speaker 5>chance to shoot back up the hierarchy if</v>

929
00:52:06.951 --> 00:52:08.600
<v Speaker 5>that's the sort of thing that you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>looking for.</v>

930
00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:09.651
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

931
00:52:09.651 --> 00:52:10.484
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't help thinking about sort of the </v>

932
00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:15.920
<v Speaker 4>evolutionary theories of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

933
00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:21.460
<v Speaker 4>of Senescence and bodily repair that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

934
00:52:22.110 --> 00:52:22.943
<v Speaker 4>or pioneer by Sir Peter Medawar back in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the 50s and develop more by George </v>

935
00:52:27.230 --> 00:52:28.350
<v Speaker 4>Williams.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The idea that,</v>

936
00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:29.213
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

937
00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:31.793
<v Speaker 4>betty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>betty things involve some sort of trade </v>

938
00:52:33.271 --> 00:52:38.271
<v Speaker 4>off between expenditure for expenditure </v>
<v Speaker 4>of energy,</v>

939
00:52:39.121 --> 00:52:39.954
<v Speaker 4>of accumulative resources,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of capacity in the pursuit of something </v>

940
00:52:43.081 --> 00:52:48.081
<v Speaker 4>now at the expense of</v>
<v Speaker 4>reduced capacity to be successful later.</v>

941
00:52:50.340 --> 00:52:53.010
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so you know,</v>

942
00:52:53.011 --> 00:52:56.760
<v Speaker 4>what breeze of why these chronic states </v>
<v Speaker 4>may have logged herb.</v>

943
00:52:57.040 --> 00:52:57.873
<v Speaker 4>I'm a damaging effects is because </v>
<v Speaker 4>selection against big of these chronic </v>

944
00:53:01.381 --> 00:53:02.214
<v Speaker 4>states has not been strong because those</v>
<v Speaker 4>who are in them for a long time didn't </v>

945
00:53:06.541 --> 00:53:09.180
<v Speaker 4>historically tend to live very long </v>
<v Speaker 4>anyway.</v>

946
00:53:09.210 --> 00:53:10.200
<v Speaker 4>And they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're being,</v>

947
00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:11.513
<v Speaker 4>if you like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>motivated or prepared to engage at a </v>

948
00:53:14.371 --> 00:53:18.300
<v Speaker 4>high risk activities that at least have </v>
<v Speaker 4>subjects of short term payoff,</v>

949
00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:20.340
<v Speaker 4>which is more or less what you said </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually.</v>

950
00:53:21.270 --> 00:53:21.871
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

951
00:53:21.871 --> 00:53:25.230
<v Speaker 5>you talked about miss,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's call it a misbegotten,</v>

952
00:53:25.590 --> 00:53:28.490
<v Speaker 5>that there's stress at the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>dominance hierarchy,</v>

953
00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:29.333
<v Speaker 5>just like there is stress at the bottom </v>
<v Speaker 5>and the stress at the top is </v>

954
00:53:31.770 --> 00:53:34.080
<v Speaker 5>responsibility and decision making and </v>
<v Speaker 5>all of that.</v>

955
00:53:34.081 --> 00:53:35.380
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

956
00:53:35.530 --> 00:53:38.310
<v Speaker 5>I do believe that there's truth in that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's an important,</v>

957
00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:41.820
<v Speaker 5>another important biological element </v>
<v Speaker 5>that needs to be considered.</v>

958
00:53:41.821 --> 00:53:42.930
<v Speaker 5>And so there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

959
00:53:43.050 --> 00:53:43.883
<v Speaker 5>there's plenty of work done in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>domains of clinical psychology and some </v>

960
00:53:48.151 --> 00:53:52.200
<v Speaker 5>of this is psychophysiological and neuro</v>
<v Speaker 5>physiological for that matter,</v>

961
00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:53.573
<v Speaker 5>showing that a stress of an equivalent </v>
<v Speaker 5>magnitude as fewer negative effects if </v>

962
00:53:59.881 --> 00:54:03.720
<v Speaker 5>it's taken on voluntarily.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So because what happens,</v>

963
00:54:03.721 --> 00:54:07.830
<v Speaker 5>what happens is that if you voluntarily </v>
<v Speaker 5>engage in a stressful activity,</v>

964
00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:11.910
<v Speaker 5>your approach systems are activated </v>
<v Speaker 5>rather than your defense systems.</v>

965
00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:16.290
<v Speaker 5>And the approach systems are associated </v>
<v Speaker 5>with positive emotion and with,</v>

966
00:54:16.350 --> 00:54:17.170
<v Speaker 5>and with much.</v>

967
00:54:17.170 --> 00:54:21.720
<v Speaker 5>And where is the negative emotions are </v>
<v Speaker 5>associated with this defensive posturing</v>

968
00:54:21.721 --> 00:54:22.554
<v Speaker 5>that includes preparation for emergency </v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's much more physiologically </v>

969
00:54:25.621 --> 00:54:28.320
<v Speaker 5>damaging.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so whether something,</v>

970
00:54:28.410 --> 00:54:32.100
<v Speaker 5>whether you pick up a load voluntarily </v>
<v Speaker 5>or have it thrust upon you,</v>

971
00:54:32.370 --> 00:54:34.800
<v Speaker 5>seems to make a big difference to how </v>
<v Speaker 5>heavy it is.</v>

972
00:54:35.010 --> 00:54:36.060
<v Speaker 5>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's very,</v>

973
00:54:36.061 --> 00:54:36.894
<v Speaker 5>it's a very interesting piece of a set </v>
<v Speaker 5>of research studies as far as I'm </v>

974
00:54:41.191 --> 00:54:42.024
<v Speaker 5>concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's quite fascinating that that can be </v>

975
00:54:43.561 --> 00:54:45.000
<v Speaker 5>the case.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

976
00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:47.850
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So let me ask you another question.</v>

977
00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:48.713
<v Speaker 5>Let's get down to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we might say brass tacks here so we can </v>

978
00:54:51.541 --> 00:54:56.480
<v Speaker 5>make a case that inequality destabilize </v>
<v Speaker 5>the societies and,</v>

979
00:54:56.580 --> 00:54:57.413
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and cranks up the male on male homicide </v>

980
00:54:59.071 --> 00:54:59.904
<v Speaker 5>rate and the destabilization of curves </v>
<v Speaker 5>because young men become more and more </v>

981
00:55:03.841 --> 00:55:04.674
<v Speaker 5>unpredictable and violent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so you could make a conservative </v>

982
00:55:06.991 --> 00:55:07.824
<v Speaker 5>case as well as the liberal case for not</v>
<v Speaker 5>having a society that takes inequality </v>

983
00:55:13.291 --> 00:55:16.770
<v Speaker 5>to an extreme because conservatives,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at least in principle,</v>

984
00:55:16.771 --> 00:55:20.220
<v Speaker 5>should be concerned with the maintenance</v>
<v Speaker 5>of social stability over the long run.</v>

985
00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:22.020
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

986
00:55:22.230 --> 00:55:23.490
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

987
00:55:23.491 --> 00:55:25.860
<v Speaker 5>And so then you might make a case for </v>
<v Speaker 5>income redistribution,</v>

988
00:55:25.861 --> 00:55:26.694
<v Speaker 5>but that gets very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very troublesome because it's not that </v>

989
00:55:28.771 --> 00:55:29.604
<v Speaker 5>easy to redistribute income.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's what I want to talk to you </v>

990
00:55:32.761 --> 00:55:33.594
<v Speaker 5>about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

991
00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:36.840
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're in a situation of course,</v>

992
00:55:36.841 --> 00:55:39.890
<v Speaker 5>where the top 1% of the population,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

993
00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:41.303
<v Speaker 5>controls a substantial proportion of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>economic resources and the top 1% of </v>

994
00:55:45.391 --> 00:55:46.224
<v Speaker 5>that top 1% controls the bulk of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now I've looked into that quite deeply </v>

995
00:55:50.761 --> 00:55:55.761
<v Speaker 5>and that that distribution is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not a normal distribution of money.</v>

996
00:55:56.190 --> 00:55:57.023
<v Speaker 5>It's a perigo distribution of money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the weird thing about pareto </v>

997
00:56:00.031 --> 00:56:02.730
<v Speaker 5>distributions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so that's a distribution where many,</v>

998
00:56:02.731 --> 00:56:04.950
<v Speaker 5>many people end up with zero.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

999
00:56:04.951 --> 00:56:09.951
<v Speaker 5>just a few people end up with a lot is </v>
<v Speaker 5>that a prieto distribution characterizes</v>

1000
00:56:10.620 --> 00:56:13.440
<v Speaker 5>zero sum games that are played out to </v>
<v Speaker 5>their conclusion.</v>

1001
00:56:13.530 --> 00:56:16.140
<v Speaker 5>So like monopoly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody starts in the middle,</v>

1002
00:56:16.170 --> 00:56:17.003
<v Speaker 5>but then random trading produces an </v>
<v Speaker 5>eventual prieto shaped distribution </v>

1003
00:56:20.431 --> 00:56:23.590
<v Speaker 5>where lots of people start to stack up </v>
<v Speaker 5>on the loser side.</v>

1004
00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:24.633
<v Speaker 5>One person accelerates towards victory </v>
<v Speaker 5>until finally everyone's at zero except </v>

1005
00:56:28.151 --> 00:56:28.984
<v Speaker 5>one person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's the logical outcome of random </v>

1006
00:56:31.151 --> 00:56:31.984
<v Speaker 5>trading game.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's the first thing that's </v>

1007
00:56:33.461 --> 00:56:35.440
<v Speaker 5>interesting about the prieto </v>
<v Speaker 5>distribution.</v>

1008
00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:39.760
<v Speaker 5>The second thing that's interesting is </v>
<v Speaker 5>that pareto distributions,</v>

1009
00:56:40.150 --> 00:56:40.983
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they prieto distributions emerge in </v>

1010
00:56:43.481 --> 00:56:46.360
<v Speaker 5>every domain of creative human </v>
<v Speaker 5>production,</v>

1011
00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:49.420
<v Speaker 5>not just the distribution of money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So for example,</v>

1012
00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:50.953
<v Speaker 5>we did an analysis of the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of creative achievement across the </v>

1013
00:56:54.161 --> 00:56:56.330
<v Speaker 5>lifespan using uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>using,</v>

1014
00:56:56.370 --> 00:56:57.203
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>an instrument called the creative </v>

1015
00:56:58.271 --> 00:56:59.104
<v Speaker 5>achievement questionnaire.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what it did was assess people's </v>

1016
00:57:01.780 --> 00:57:06.190
<v Speaker 5>levels of competence across 13 potential</v>
<v Speaker 5>domains of creative activity.</v>

1017
00:57:06.550 --> 00:57:09.940
<v Speaker 5>And so we were looking at production </v>
<v Speaker 5>rather than creative thinking per se,</v>

1018
00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:11.013
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Although those two things are related </v>

1019
00:57:12.071 --> 00:57:12.904
<v Speaker 5>and quite tightly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we wanted to know who actually </v>

1020
00:57:15.041 --> 00:57:16.810
<v Speaker 5>accomplished things in the world.</v>

1021
00:57:16.870 --> 00:57:20.080
<v Speaker 5>And so for musical ability,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

1022
00:57:20.140 --> 00:57:24.380
<v Speaker 5>the zero score would be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have no training or,</v>

1023
00:57:24.410 --> 00:57:28.660
<v Speaker 5>or talent in this area.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the maximum score would be,</v>

1024
00:57:29.110 --> 00:57:29.770
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my,</v>

1025
00:57:29.770 --> 00:57:32.230
<v Speaker 5>my comp,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my original compositions of being played</v>

1026
00:57:32.231 --> 00:57:33.064
<v Speaker 5>for international audiences.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so we've now administered that to </v>

1027
00:57:35.921 --> 00:57:36.754
<v Speaker 5>hunt to hundreds of people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the median score is zero across all </v>

1028
00:57:39.971 --> 00:57:42.070
<v Speaker 5>13 domains.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a very,</v>

1029
00:57:42.071 --> 00:57:43.100
<v Speaker 5>very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1030
00:57:43.540 --> 00:57:44.373
<v Speaker 5>precise burrito distribution with a few </v>
<v Speaker 5>people who are the outliers producing </v>

1031
00:57:47.861 --> 00:57:51.160
<v Speaker 5>the overwhelming majority of the goods.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you also,</v>

1032
00:57:51.310 --> 00:57:54.570
<v Speaker 5>and that there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's also a law that desota price,</v>

1033
00:57:54.750 --> 00:57:57.790
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>came up with back in the 1960s governing</v>

1034
00:57:58.060 --> 00:58:03.060
<v Speaker 5>the output of scientific papers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he found that the square root of the</v>

1035
00:58:03.161 --> 00:58:07.600
<v Speaker 5>number of people operating within an </v>
<v Speaker 5>academic domain produced half the papers</v>

1036
00:58:07.720 --> 00:58:09.760
<v Speaker 5>that were published in that domain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1037
00:58:09.790 --> 00:58:10.740
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1038
00:58:10.810 --> 00:58:11.643
<v Speaker 5>so that's not so bad if there's 10 </v>
<v Speaker 5>researchers because then three of them </v>

1039
00:58:14.141 --> 00:58:15.970
<v Speaker 5>are producing half the papers.</v>

1040
00:58:16.270 --> 00:58:19.300
<v Speaker 5>But if there's a thousand researchers </v>
<v Speaker 5>operating in a domain,</v>

1041
00:58:19.301 --> 00:58:21.880
<v Speaker 5>then 30 of them are producing half the </v>
<v Speaker 5>papers.</v>

1042
00:58:22.540 --> 00:58:23.373
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so and then one more complication and </v>

1043
00:58:25.031 --> 00:58:29.410
<v Speaker 5>then I'm going to let you let you have </v>
<v Speaker 5>at this.</v>

1044
00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:30.633
<v Speaker 5>So I'd be looking for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>now you can think that the prio </v>

1045
00:58:32.681 --> 00:58:33.514
<v Speaker 5>distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which by the way characterizes the </v>

1046
00:58:35.111 --> 00:58:37.450
<v Speaker 5>distribution of wealth in every known </v>
<v Speaker 5>society,</v>

1047
00:58:37.451 --> 00:58:41.350
<v Speaker 5>although the degree to which the </v>
<v Speaker 5>distribution is skewed differs.</v>

1048
00:58:42.040 --> 00:58:46.540
<v Speaker 5>You can say that the Prieto distribution</v>
<v Speaker 5>is a consequence of the,</v>

1049
00:58:46.930 --> 00:58:49.420
<v Speaker 5>of the final playing out of a random </v>
<v Speaker 5>trading game.</v>

1050
00:58:49.660 --> 00:58:50.493
<v Speaker 5>But then here's the complication.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is something that's been bothering </v>

1051
00:58:53.801 --> 00:58:54.634
<v Speaker 5>me for years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There are predictors of longterm life </v>

1052
00:58:58.181 --> 00:58:59.014
<v Speaker 5>success in relatively stable societies </v>
<v Speaker 5>and the best predictors are in this </v>

1053
00:59:04.601 --> 00:59:06.760
<v Speaker 5>order.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The first predictor is Iq,</v>

1054
00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:10.840
<v Speaker 5>the second predictor is trait </v>
<v Speaker 5>conscientiousness and it's about half as</v>

1055
00:59:10.841 --> 00:59:11.674
<v Speaker 5>powerful as Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the third predictor is low </v>

1056
00:59:13.661 --> 00:59:17.470
<v Speaker 5>neuroticism and it's about half as </v>
<v Speaker 5>powerful as conscientiousness.</v>

1057
00:59:17.770 --> 00:59:21.890
<v Speaker 5>So if you get a good measure of Iq and a</v>
<v Speaker 5>good measure of conscientiousness,</v>

1058
00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:26.150
<v Speaker 5>then you can predict about 25% of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>variance in performance,</v>

1059
00:59:26.151 --> 00:59:30.290
<v Speaker 5>especially across managerial,</v>
<v Speaker 5>administrative and academic domains.</v>

1060
00:59:30.590 --> 00:59:33.410
<v Speaker 5>And then with regards to entrepreneurial</v>
<v Speaker 5>performance,</v>

1061
00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:38.030
<v Speaker 5>you can use Iq and trade openness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is the creativity measure.</v>

1062
00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:39.313
<v Speaker 5>So there are powerful individual </v>
<v Speaker 5>differences that are driving </v>

1063
00:59:43.100 --> 00:59:46.400
<v Speaker 5>differential performance and also </v>
<v Speaker 5>driving this prieto distribution.</v>

1064
00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:51.410
<v Speaker 5>And so it's not merely a random game,</v>
<v Speaker 5>although how these people manage to make</v>

1065
00:59:51.411 --> 00:59:55.520
<v Speaker 5>it into not a random game is beyond me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But there is evidence that,</v>

1066
00:59:55.700 --> 00:59:56.533
<v Speaker 5>that our society does hierarchically </v>
<v Speaker 5>arrange itself at least to some degree </v>

1067
01:00:00.291 --> 01:00:01.124
<v Speaker 5>by ability and competence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so then the question is how do you </v>

1068
01:00:04.311 --> 01:00:09.311
<v Speaker 5>factor that into the equation when </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're thinking about practical,</v>

1069
01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:10.753
<v Speaker 5>let's call them income.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it's so much income </v>

1070
01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:13.993
<v Speaker 5>redistribution is that it's an attempt </v>
<v Speaker 5>by society to stop too many people from </v>

1071
01:00:17.421 --> 01:00:18.254
<v Speaker 5>stacking up at zero and therefore </v>
<v Speaker 5>logically turning to violence and that </v>

1072
01:00:22.071 --> 01:00:23.360
<v Speaker 5>sort of thing as an alternative.</v>

1073
01:00:24.510 --> 01:00:27.030
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as well as an attempt to just</v>

1074
01:00:30.150 --> 01:00:33.180
<v Speaker 4>improve the level of justice in society.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The idea,</v>

1075
01:00:33.270 --> 01:00:33.931
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1076
01:00:33.931 --> 01:00:34.764
<v Speaker 4>especially if there's an element,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a strong element of randomness and who </v>

1077
01:00:37.171 --> 01:00:38.004
<v Speaker 4>ends up where then there's something </v>
<v Speaker 4>unjust about large numbers being stuck </v>

1078
01:00:41.491 --> 01:00:42.900
<v Speaker 4>down at the Xero.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

1079
01:00:42.901 --> 01:00:44.340
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1080
01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:47.400
<v Speaker 4>you say how is it possible to </v>
<v Speaker 4>redistribute,</v>

1081
01:00:47.401 --> 01:00:49.590
<v Speaker 4>but countries vary and the extent which </v>
<v Speaker 4>they do this,</v>

1082
01:00:49.591 --> 01:00:53.070
<v Speaker 4>they very into the extent to which they </v>
<v Speaker 4>tax inheritance,</v>

1083
01:00:53.071 --> 01:00:58.071
<v Speaker 4>they value barrier and the extent to </v>
<v Speaker 4>which they tax liar or cubs of they vary</v>

1084
01:00:58.621 --> 01:00:59.454
<v Speaker 4>and the extent to which they provide </v>
<v Speaker 4>education and health care try provide </v>

1085
01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:08.040
<v Speaker 4>relatively a universally trying to make </v>
<v Speaker 4>opportunity,</v>

1086
01:01:08.041 --> 01:01:12.210
<v Speaker 4>relatively universal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They vary in these things and you know,</v>

1087
01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:14.753
<v Speaker 4>some of the happiest countries in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world and I think the most productive </v>

1088
01:01:17.221 --> 01:01:18.780
<v Speaker 4>countries in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1089
01:01:18.810 --> 01:01:19.643
<v Speaker 4>the Nordic countries,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Japan have the relatively equitable </v>

1090
01:01:23.730 --> 01:01:27.930
<v Speaker 4>because they rigged this gay board that </v>
<v Speaker 4>some other countries if you like.</v>

1091
01:01:28.170 --> 01:01:29.550
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you know,</v>

1092
01:01:29.551 --> 01:01:30.660
<v Speaker 4>you say that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1093
01:01:31.260 --> 01:01:34.620
<v Speaker 4>what stacks up at the top tend to be the</v>
<v Speaker 4>most competent creative people.</v>

1094
01:01:34.621 --> 01:01:35.454
<v Speaker 4>And to imply that to some degree we have</v>
<v Speaker 4>a meritocracy and to some degree we do </v>

1095
01:01:39.001 --> 01:01:41.190
<v Speaker 4>have a shock.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

1096
01:01:42.210 --> 01:01:43.043
<v Speaker 4>the four wall Bollard Bard ehrs have as </v>
<v Speaker 4>much wealth as the hundred billion </v>

1097
01:01:47.641 --> 01:01:51.960
<v Speaker 4>poorest Americans putting together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they did nothing to earn it.</v>

1098
01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:54.420
<v Speaker 4>You could say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1099
01:01:54.450 --> 01:01:58.920
<v Speaker 4>they're high quality people because they</v>
<v Speaker 4>got half of their genes from Sam Walton.</v>

1100
01:01:58.921 --> 01:02:00.450
<v Speaker 4>Did he did something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Darn it.</v>

1101
01:02:00.630 --> 01:02:01.463
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that seems like a pretty weak argument </v>

1102
01:02:02.761 --> 01:02:05.220
<v Speaker 4>for why they should control that much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1103
01:02:05.570 --> 01:02:06.403
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if inheritance were more severely taxed </v>

1104
01:02:09.361 --> 01:02:11.730
<v Speaker 4>in order to provide public goods for </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody,</v>

1105
01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:14.440
<v Speaker 4>would this society to be worse off </v>
<v Speaker 4>would,</v>

1106
01:02:14.490 --> 01:02:15.323
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>flattening out that curve of </v>

1107
01:02:17.041 --> 01:02:20.340
<v Speaker 4>accomplished but actually reduced?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1108
01:02:20.341 --> 01:02:21.340
<v Speaker 4>I think there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

1109
01:02:21.550 --> 01:02:22.383
<v Speaker 4>there's some evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wish I could pull it to the forefront </v>

1110
01:02:24.251 --> 01:02:29.251
<v Speaker 4>of my mind about the utility of </v>
<v Speaker 4>distributing grab buddy,</v>

1111
01:02:29.710 --> 01:02:30.543
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more or less equitably and certain </v>

1112
01:02:32.810 --> 01:02:33.643
<v Speaker 4>sciences,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the amount of science you get for your </v>

1113
01:02:35.431 --> 01:02:38.640
<v Speaker 4>buck is better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where you give lots of lots of people,</v>

1114
01:02:38.641 --> 01:02:41.520
<v Speaker 4>relatively small grants that will,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you give us a small number of people,</v>

1115
01:02:41.521 --> 01:02:42.790
<v Speaker 4>relatively large grades.</v>

1116
01:02:43.630 --> 01:02:44.463
<v Speaker 5>That's interesting because I've worked </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the grant system in the u s and </v>

1117
01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:50.260
<v Speaker 5>Canada and the grant system in the u s </v>
<v Speaker 5>is more of the,</v>

1118
01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:53.290
<v Speaker 5>give a few people a huge amount of money</v>
<v Speaker 5>for variety.</v>

1119
01:02:53.291 --> 01:02:56.750
<v Speaker 5>And in Canada it's distributed more </v>
<v Speaker 5>equitably.</v>

1120
01:02:56.751 --> 01:03:01.210
<v Speaker 5>And I must say that I vastly prefer the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Canadian system now.</v>

1121
01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:01.560
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1122
01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:02.393
<v Speaker 4>I agree with you and I think the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Canadian system has been moving </v>

1123
01:03:04.441 --> 01:03:06.360
<v Speaker 4>regrettably of the direction of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>American.</v>

1124
01:03:06.540 --> 01:03:07.373
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it partly depends on the field of </v>

1125
01:03:07.861 --> 01:03:08.611
<v Speaker 4>science.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course,</v>

1126
01:03:08.611 --> 01:03:09.630
<v Speaker 4>if you need a buddy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

1127
01:03:09.631 --> 01:03:12.690
<v Speaker 4>drug collider,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you need billions,</v>

1128
01:03:12.690 --> 01:03:13.523
<v Speaker 4>millions of dollars if you're a </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychologist like you or be a thing to </v>

1129
01:03:17.371 --> 01:03:18.204
<v Speaker 4>seem to work better in many ways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you fund the higher proportion of </v>

1130
01:03:22.171 --> 01:03:26.610
<v Speaker 4>grads with a lower variance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the amount awarded.</v>

1131
01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:30.420
<v Speaker 4>What I first came to mcmaster,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was exactly,</v>

1132
01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:32.153
<v Speaker 4>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I shouldn't say what I first came by by </v>

1133
01:03:33.450 --> 01:03:34.283
<v Speaker 4>saying let's say the late eighties and </v>
<v Speaker 4>early nineties essentially everybody in </v>

1134
01:03:39.001 --> 01:03:39.834
<v Speaker 4>the department how to research grab from</v>
<v Speaker 4>either end circ that the natural </v>

1135
01:03:43.771 --> 01:03:46.470
<v Speaker 4>sciences and Engineering Research </v>
<v Speaker 4>Council of Canada or sure.</v>

1136
01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:49.220
<v Speaker 4>The social sciences and Humanities </v>
<v Speaker 4>Research Council of Canada,</v>

1137
01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:51.570
<v Speaker 4>usually the former at our particular </v>
<v Speaker 4>department,</v>

1138
01:03:52.140 --> 01:03:54.750
<v Speaker 4>everybody in the department had an </v>
<v Speaker 4>active research lab.</v>

1139
01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:58.860
<v Speaker 4>Everybody created the opportunity for </v>
<v Speaker 4>two or three students to do a bachelor's</v>

1140
01:03:58.861 --> 01:04:02.390
<v Speaker 4>thesis of their lab each year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That would things get more variable.</v>

1141
01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:04.810
<v Speaker 4>People Start People's people who are </v>
<v Speaker 4>being productive,</v>

1142
01:04:04.811 --> 01:04:08.100
<v Speaker 4>who are getting out of scientific paper </v>
<v Speaker 4>or to doing decent work,</v>

1143
01:04:08.101 --> 01:04:11.290
<v Speaker 4>making a contribution to knowledge when </v>
<v Speaker 4>they start big to die.</v>

1144
01:04:11.340 --> 01:04:13.050
<v Speaker 4>These grads,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1145
01:04:13.051 --> 01:04:17.040
<v Speaker 4>like you refuse to or three times of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>competition say,</v>

1146
01:04:17.190 --> 01:04:18.390
<v Speaker 4>well the hell with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1147
01:04:18.391 --> 01:04:22.040
<v Speaker 4>I mean I've got tell you I've got a good</v>
<v Speaker 4>pinch of wind up.</v>

1148
01:04:22.050 --> 01:04:23.820
<v Speaker 4>I think I'll become a real estate </v>
<v Speaker 4>speculator.</v>

1149
01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:25.560
<v Speaker 4>The opportunities for</v>

1150
01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:29.313
<v Speaker 4>the dissemination of research </v>
<v Speaker 4>opportunity to a larger number of </v>

1151
01:04:31.751 --> 01:04:33.970
<v Speaker 4>students shrink.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1152
01:04:34.450 --> 01:04:35.283
<v Speaker 4>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's been a disaster in surgery or I </v>

1153
01:04:37.841 --> 01:04:38.610
<v Speaker 4>guess,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1154
01:04:38.610 --> 01:04:41.100
<v Speaker 4>an area where I was raised animal </v>
<v Speaker 4>behavior studies.</v>

1155
01:04:42.610 --> 01:04:47.610
<v Speaker 4>If you just look at either the number of</v>
<v Speaker 4>papers in top ranked journals by country</v>

1156
01:04:49.180 --> 01:04:50.013
<v Speaker 4>according to how they allocate their </v>
<v Speaker 4>funds or how much buddy is allocated to </v>

1157
01:04:53.291 --> 01:04:54.124
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the buddy allocated to it as the less </v>

1158
01:04:55.631 --> 01:04:59.080
<v Speaker 4>strong predictor of you'd expect of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>equitability is a stronger predictor.</v>

1159
01:04:59.290 --> 01:05:00.123
<v Speaker 4>Sweet and Canada used to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>last time I looked both reg far above </v>

1160
01:05:04.391 --> 01:05:05.224
<v Speaker 4>the United States in numbers of papers </v>
<v Speaker 4>per capita getting into top quality </v>

1161
01:05:10.811 --> 01:05:14.700
<v Speaker 4>research gertels inedible behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's one little addict.</v>

1162
01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:15.910
<v Speaker 4>Don't know way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>

1163
01:05:16.150 --> 01:05:18.160
<v Speaker 4>but I would be very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if there's some</v>

1164
01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:20.580
<v Speaker 5>generality to this flowed well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are there,</v>

1165
01:05:20.590 --> 01:05:22.110
<v Speaker 5>I wonder though,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1166
01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:23.133
<v Speaker 5>to play devil's advocate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the thing about distributing </v>

1167
01:05:25.691 --> 01:05:26.524
<v Speaker 5>research funds more equitably is that </v>
<v Speaker 5>you are distributing them among a </v>

1168
01:05:29.531 --> 01:05:30.364
<v Speaker 5>population that's already being </v>
<v Speaker 5>extraordinarily highly selected for </v>

1169
01:05:32.690 --> 01:05:33.523
<v Speaker 5>capability.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so it seems counterproductive </v>

1170
01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:39.370
<v Speaker 5>because it's for all the flaws of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>university system,</v>

1171
01:05:39.371 --> 01:05:42.670
<v Speaker 5>which are manifold.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is still extraordinarily difficult to</v>

1172
01:05:42.671 --> 01:05:43.950
<v Speaker 5>become a professor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a,</v>

1173
01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:45.073
<v Speaker 5>it's a multitiered selection system.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so the people who do become </v>

1174
01:05:49.090 --> 01:05:53.170
<v Speaker 5>professors are on average,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very intelligent and on average,</v>

1175
01:05:53.171 --> 01:05:54.004
<v Speaker 5>very hardworking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And we know that because we know what </v>

1176
01:05:55.781 --> 01:05:56.614
<v Speaker 5>the predictors are of success in </v>
<v Speaker 5>academia and its intelligence and </v>

1177
01:06:00.070 --> 01:06:01.670
<v Speaker 5>conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>unsurprisingly,</v>

1178
01:06:01.690 --> 01:06:05.100
<v Speaker 5>although creativity seems to play almost</v>
<v Speaker 5>zero rule had that.</v>

1179
01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:06.700
<v Speaker 5>Well the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1180
01:06:06.870 --> 01:06:09.760
<v Speaker 5>but that's partly because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sciences and algorithmic gay,</v>

1181
01:06:09.790 --> 01:06:10.623
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And just beating away at it busily is a </v>

1182
01:06:13.061 --> 01:06:14.620
<v Speaker 5>very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very powerful mechanism.</v>

1183
01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:17.290
<v Speaker 5>So I'm not the least bit cynical about </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

1184
01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:19.780
<v Speaker 5>I mean the reason that science works is </v>
<v Speaker 5>because it's,</v>

1185
01:06:19.870 --> 01:06:22.840
<v Speaker 5>in some sense it has the aspect of </v>
<v Speaker 5>factory production.</v>

1186
01:06:22.841 --> 01:06:23.674
<v Speaker 5>It can be distributed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anyone can learn to do it and you get </v>

1187
01:06:26.261 --> 01:06:28.990
<v Speaker 5>along way is by nibbling at the edges.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1188
01:06:28.991 --> 01:06:32.410
<v Speaker 5>it's continual,</v>
<v Speaker 5>continual slow progress when millions of</v>

1189
01:06:32.411 --> 01:06:34.960
<v Speaker 5>people are doing it is progress.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's plenty rapid.</v>

1190
01:06:35.530 --> 01:06:37.120
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1191
01:06:37.121 --> 01:06:37.954
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so there are definitely situations in </v>

1192
01:06:39.281 --> 01:06:43.000
<v Speaker 5>which denying people resources seems to </v>
<v Speaker 5>be completely counterproductive and that</v>

1193
01:06:43.001 --> 01:06:44.860
<v Speaker 5>would be one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

1194
01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:49.360
<v Speaker 5>now the other question though is I would</v>
<v Speaker 5>say,</v>

1195
01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:50.233
<v Speaker 5>and also that's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's also an effective means of </v>

1196
01:06:53.081 --> 01:06:56.590
<v Speaker 5>funneling resources to let's say a wide </v>
<v Speaker 5>range of professors.</v>

1197
01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:57.513
<v Speaker 5>It actually works the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the problems with general income </v>

1198
01:07:00.761 --> 01:07:02.800
<v Speaker 5>redistribution is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as far as I can tell,</v>

1199
01:07:02.801 --> 01:07:05.050
<v Speaker 5>is that we don't really know how to do </v>
<v Speaker 5>it very well.</v>

1200
01:07:05.590 --> 01:07:07.270
<v Speaker 5>And one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean look here,</v>

1201
01:07:07.271 --> 01:07:08.104
<v Speaker 5>here's an example.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can tell me what you think about </v>

1202
01:07:09.341 --> 01:07:11.440
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I used to work,</v>

1203
01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:14.060
<v Speaker 5>I used to live in northern Alberta when </v>
<v Speaker 5>the oil price,</v>

1204
01:07:14.250 --> 01:07:15.850
<v Speaker 5>sporadic oil,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oops were going on.</v>

1205
01:07:15.851 --> 01:07:16.684
<v Speaker 5>And my observation was that if you </v>
<v Speaker 5>wanted to make money in Alberta when an </v>

1206
01:07:21.161 --> 01:07:24.370
<v Speaker 5>oil boom was going on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you didn't go out and work on the rigs.</v>

1207
01:07:24.580 --> 01:07:25.413
<v Speaker 5>Although if you did that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could make a tremendous amount of </v>

1208
01:07:27.281 --> 01:07:28.114
<v Speaker 5>money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now it was all young men who did that </v>

1209
01:07:29.830 --> 01:07:32.500
<v Speaker 5>pretty much say between the ages of 16 </v>
<v Speaker 5>and 25,</v>

1210
01:07:32.501 --> 01:07:33.334
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they were making fantastic amounts </v>

1211
01:07:35.291 --> 01:07:36.124
<v Speaker 5>of money,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they verged almost all of them came </v>

1212
01:07:38.681 --> 01:07:39.514
<v Speaker 5>out of it with nothing to show for it </v>
<v Speaker 5>because they would work for two weeks </v>

1213
01:07:42.821 --> 01:07:43.654
<v Speaker 5>and then go into town and it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>have a blowout party for four days and </v>

1214
01:07:46.271 --> 01:07:50.410
<v Speaker 5>spent everything they got and expensive </v>
<v Speaker 5>cars and wreck them and so forth.</v>

1215
01:07:50.410 --> 01:07:52.580
<v Speaker 5>So it was reckless behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1216
01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:55.810
<v Speaker 5>that I think was a kid in some sense to </v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

1217
01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:56.740
<v Speaker 5>to that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1218
01:07:56.830 --> 01:07:58.600
<v Speaker 5>to the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to the steep dominance,</v>

1219
01:07:58.601 --> 01:08:01.090
<v Speaker 5>hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>violence and that sort of thing.</v>

1220
01:08:01.091 --> 01:08:01.924
<v Speaker 5>That for status seeking that you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>describing the people who really made </v>

1221
01:08:05.681 --> 01:08:08.290
<v Speaker 5>money where the bartenders,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>

1222
01:08:08.291 --> 01:08:09.121
<v Speaker 5>because they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

1223
01:08:09.121 --> 01:08:11.980
<v Speaker 5>they absorbed all the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the excess profits.</v>

1224
01:08:11.981 --> 01:08:12.814
<v Speaker 5>And actually generally,</v>
<v Speaker 5>generally speaking or comparatively </v>

1225
01:08:15.681 --> 01:08:16.514
<v Speaker 5>speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're able to utilize the money </v>

1226
01:08:18.441 --> 01:08:19.550
<v Speaker 5>properly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

1227
01:08:19.610 --> 01:08:24.440
<v Speaker 5>the point I'm making is that an oil boom</v>
<v Speaker 5>isn't very effective way of distributing</v>

1228
01:08:24.441 --> 01:08:25.274
<v Speaker 5>wealth down the economic louder.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it didn't necessarily seem to me to </v>

1229
01:08:28.641 --> 01:08:29.474
<v Speaker 5>be a very effective one because it </v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't because the money flowed back up </v>

1230
01:08:33.201 --> 01:08:36.800
<v Speaker 5>to the top 1% damn near as fast as you </v>
<v Speaker 5>can shovel it downwards.</v>

1231
01:08:36.801 --> 01:08:37.634
<v Speaker 5>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the thing about that damn prieto </v>

1232
01:08:39.471 --> 01:08:43.010
<v Speaker 5>distribution is that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it seems there are people,</v>

1233
01:08:43.011 --> 01:08:43.844
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a,</v>

1234
01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:45.433
<v Speaker 5>there's a group,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a scientific subfield called </v>

1235
01:08:47.691 --> 01:08:48.524
<v Speaker 5>econo physicists and they actually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they actually modeled the distribution </v>

1236
01:08:52.671 --> 01:08:57.500
<v Speaker 5>of money in an economy using the same </v>
<v Speaker 5>equations that model the distribution of</v>

1237
01:08:57.501 --> 01:08:58.940
<v Speaker 5>a gas into a vacuum.</v>

1238
01:08:59.690 --> 01:09:04.690
<v Speaker 5>So there's something that's natural law </v>
<v Speaker 5>like about this that the economists call</v>

1239
01:09:05.061 --> 01:09:06.530
<v Speaker 5>it the matthew principle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1240
01:09:06.590 --> 01:09:07.423
<v Speaker 5>To those who have everything more will </v>
<v Speaker 5>be given and from those who have </v>

1241
01:09:09.951 --> 01:09:11.450
<v Speaker 5>nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything will be taken.</v>

1242
01:09:11.451 --> 01:09:12.284
<v Speaker 5>And I don't think that we've done a good</v>
<v Speaker 5>job of grappling with the actual </v>

1243
01:09:15.321 --> 01:09:19.220
<v Speaker 5>complexity of this and we tend to split </v>
<v Speaker 5>up into politically opposed,</v>

1244
01:09:19.580 --> 01:09:20.413
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what would you call camps and argue </v>

1245
01:09:22.101 --> 01:09:24.770
<v Speaker 5>about the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the solution to inequality.</v>

1246
01:09:24.771 --> 01:09:27.710
<v Speaker 5>And the left wing solution is something </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1247
01:09:27.980 --> 01:09:29.240
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>distribute the money,</v>

1248
01:09:29.241 --> 01:09:32.480
<v Speaker 5>take it from the rich,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially they undeserving rich.</v>

1249
01:09:32.481 --> 01:09:36.560
<v Speaker 5>If you can identify them and give it to </v>
<v Speaker 5>the poor and the conservatives say,</v>

1250
01:09:36.561 --> 01:09:39.530
<v Speaker 5>well no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the poorest of the poor should bootstrap</v>

1251
01:09:39.531 --> 01:09:43.190
<v Speaker 5>themselves up and maybe be provided with</v>
<v Speaker 5>more opportunity and that might equalize</v>

1252
01:09:43.191 --> 01:09:44.024
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it isn't clear to me that we're </v>

1253
01:09:45.231 --> 01:09:47.960
<v Speaker 5>actually grappling with the magnitude of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the problem.</v>

1254
01:09:48.470 --> 01:09:49.303
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it isn't clear</v>

1255
01:09:49.330 --> 01:09:50.163
<v Speaker 4>either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what you say about equalizing </v>

1256
01:09:51.931 --> 01:09:52.764
<v Speaker 4>opportunity for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it a set to distributing the </v>

1257
01:09:54.930 --> 01:09:55.763
<v Speaker 4>resources because one way you equalize </v>
<v Speaker 4>opportunity is by having universal high </v>

1258
01:09:59.941 --> 01:10:04.440
<v Speaker 4>quality health care that's paid for by </v>
<v Speaker 4>sub sort of government.</v>

1259
01:10:04.441 --> 01:10:07.350
<v Speaker 4>Wherever you sub taxes picked up </v>
<v Speaker 4>somewhere.</v>

1260
01:10:07.690 --> 01:10:09.850
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>free education,</v>

1261
01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:15.810
<v Speaker 4>universal access to education is </v>
<v Speaker 4>certainly another,</v>

1262
01:10:15.811 --> 01:10:16.650
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1263
01:10:16.710 --> 01:10:20.970
<v Speaker 4>it's another way that an effect you </v>
<v Speaker 4>create a more egalitarian society.</v>

1264
01:10:21.150 --> 01:10:21.900
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there are,</v>

1265
01:10:21.900 --> 01:10:24.520
<v Speaker 4>there are certain domains,</v>
<v Speaker 4>certainly education and healthcare,</v>

1266
01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:26.700
<v Speaker 4>maybe some others that are not spraying </v>
<v Speaker 4>to mine.</v>

1267
01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:27.893
<v Speaker 4>Well I suppose the improvement of </v>
<v Speaker 4>various sorts of infra infrastructure </v>

1268
01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:31.330
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1269
01:10:31.350 --> 01:10:33.630
<v Speaker 4>make it easier to get from point a to </v>
<v Speaker 4>point b.</v>

1270
01:10:33.710 --> 01:10:35.220
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1271
01:10:35.990 --> 01:10:38.090
<v Speaker 4>public,</v>
<v Speaker 4>publicly subsidized treads,</v>

1272
01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:40.590
<v Speaker 4>things like that can certainly be </v>
<v Speaker 4>contributors as well.</v>

1273
01:10:40.710 --> 01:10:42.300
<v Speaker 4>Now that's equalizing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all right.</v>

1274
01:10:42.301 --> 01:10:45.330
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to take anybody a give to</v>
<v Speaker 4>get specifically to anybody else.</v>

1275
01:10:45.690 --> 01:10:47.720
<v Speaker 4>Then there's things like a guaranteed </v>
<v Speaker 4>minimum,</v>

1276
01:10:47.721 --> 01:10:50.670
<v Speaker 4>a big cub at first.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It sounds like a crazy idea.</v>

1277
01:10:50.671 --> 01:10:51.690
<v Speaker 4>The idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1278
01:10:51.691 --> 01:10:52.524
<v Speaker 4>you should just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we should take government accrued </v>

1279
01:10:56.341 --> 01:10:57.174
<v Speaker 4>resources which comes from some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>taxation and we should just make sure </v>

1280
01:10:59.911 --> 01:11:04.380
<v Speaker 4>everybody has 15,000 bucks a year to </v>
<v Speaker 4>start or something like that.</v>

1281
01:11:04.630 --> 01:11:05.463
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it sounds kind of wacky because they </v>

1282
01:11:07.561 --> 01:11:10.530
<v Speaker 4>standard argument against it from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>right has been that,</v>

1283
01:11:10.780 --> 01:11:14.670
<v Speaker 4>well underbite incentives and nobody </v>
<v Speaker 4>will produce all if you know,</v>

1284
01:11:14.671 --> 01:11:19.170
<v Speaker 4>if we could all be welfare rights,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well want to be welfare queens mostly.</v>

1285
01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:23.590
<v Speaker 4>And where this stuff has been tried by </v>
<v Speaker 4>understanding is that,</v>

1286
01:11:23.710 --> 01:11:28.290
<v Speaker 4>that it's been surprisingly successful </v>
<v Speaker 4>that there was an experiment better Toba</v>

1287
01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:32.190
<v Speaker 4>where a minimum big cub was tried for </v>
<v Speaker 4>awhile where,</v>

1288
01:11:34.170 --> 01:11:35.370
<v Speaker 4>Gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1289
01:11:35.371 --> 01:11:40.350
<v Speaker 4>I remember that</v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] about to try it.</v>

1290
01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:43.980
<v Speaker 4>Manatoba Toba has tried it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was an NDP government I think,</v>

1291
01:11:43.981 --> 01:11:46.680
<v Speaker 4>which them what replaced by conservative</v>
<v Speaker 4>or,</v>

1292
01:11:47.580 --> 01:11:49.760
<v Speaker 4>or nominally liberal governor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but um,</v>

1293
01:11:50.310 --> 01:11:51.143
<v Speaker 4>then sort of cad the results.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the results came to light later and </v>

1294
01:11:54.811 --> 01:11:55.644
<v Speaker 4>showed that for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the number of people who chose not to </v>

1295
01:11:57.931 --> 01:12:00.560
<v Speaker 4>work did not go up under this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1296
01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:04.110
<v Speaker 4>at that have various beneficial effects.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think rebates,</v>

1297
01:12:04.111 --> 01:12:04.944
<v Speaker 4>vc,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think even the idea of putting </v>

1298
01:12:06.991 --> 01:12:07.824
<v Speaker 4>buddy in the heads of everybody from the</v>
<v Speaker 4>great collective wealth that has </v>

1299
01:12:11.821 --> 01:12:15.450
<v Speaker 4>accumulated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>could be socially beneficial,</v>

1300
01:12:15.451 --> 01:12:18.480
<v Speaker 4>could be economically beneficial.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It could be environmentally beneficial.</v>

1301
01:12:21.540 --> 01:12:24.450
<v Speaker 4>Certainly the debates like education and</v>
<v Speaker 4>health care,</v>

1302
01:12:24.630 --> 01:12:27.420
<v Speaker 4>that's in effect a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>redistribution,</v>

1303
01:12:27.450 --> 01:12:31.440
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That seems easy to effectuate.</v>

1304
01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:32.453
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>easy it not easy to effectuate in terms </v>

1305
01:12:35.071 --> 01:12:40.050
<v Speaker 4>of convincing people politically or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or overcoming the propaganda against it.</v>

1306
01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:43.260
<v Speaker 4>But</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't have a whole bunch of a,</v>

1307
01:12:43.261 --> 01:12:48.261
<v Speaker 4>obviously a whole bunch of of our wealth</v>
<v Speaker 4>is embodied in the infrastructure.</v>

1308
01:12:49.420 --> 01:12:51.000
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really noticed this for example,</v>

1309
01:12:51.001 --> 01:12:51.834
<v Speaker 4>when I lived in Montreal because </v>
<v Speaker 4>Montreal is a great city and one of the </v>

1310
01:12:56.071 --> 01:12:59.190
<v Speaker 4>things that distinguishes Montreal for </v>
<v Speaker 4>most cities that I've lived in,</v>

1311
01:12:59.460 --> 01:13:03.960
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially western cities is that people</v>

1312
01:13:03.961 --> 01:13:06.540
<v Speaker 4>live in the city.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't live in their houses.</v>

1313
01:13:06.780 --> 01:13:07.613
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the fact that the city is </v>

1314
01:13:09.331 --> 01:13:12.000
<v Speaker 4>extraordinarily livable so you can walk </v>
<v Speaker 4>everywhere.</v>

1315
01:13:12.330 --> 01:13:14.520
<v Speaker 4>There's always something to do that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>exciting.</v>

1316
01:13:14.700 --> 01:13:15.533
<v Speaker 4>There's a tremendously active street </v>
<v Speaker 4>life means that there's access to </v>

1317
01:13:19.380 --> 01:13:20.213
<v Speaker 4>infrastructure and social capital </v>
<v Speaker 4>related wealth just distributed </v>

1318
01:13:24.031 --> 01:13:24.864
<v Speaker 4>everywhere.</v>

1319
01:13:24.990 --> 01:13:27.330
<v Speaker 4>And that's a lovely thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1320
01:13:27.450 --> 01:13:30.450
<v Speaker 4>so I see cows,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm kind of looking for solutions to the</v>

1321
01:13:30.451 --> 01:13:31.284
<v Speaker 4>prieto distribution problem that </v>
<v Speaker 4>conservatives and liberals alike could </v>

1322
01:13:34.350 --> 01:13:35.183
<v Speaker 4>agree upon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so some of those you outlined </v>

1323
01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:38.633
<v Speaker 4>improve the infrastructure of our </v>
<v Speaker 4>society because those are public goods </v>

1324
01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:44.760
<v Speaker 4>that benefit everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then also improve productivity.</v>

1325
01:13:44.761 --> 01:13:46.620
<v Speaker 4>It seems to be no downside to that at </v>
<v Speaker 4>all.</v>

1326
01:13:46.621 --> 01:13:47.454
<v Speaker 4>Also raises employment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>improve the quality of education right </v>

1327
01:13:51.181 --> 01:13:52.014
<v Speaker 4>from right from day one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is something that I think we do a </v>

1328
01:13:54.121 --> 01:13:56.100
<v Speaker 4>very bad job of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1329
01:13:56.380 --> 01:13:59.000
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then the issue with healthcare,</v>

1330
01:13:59.070 --> 01:13:59.903
<v Speaker 4>it's my understanding that the Canadian </v>
<v Speaker 4>healthcare system for it and it has </v>

1331
01:14:03.301 --> 01:14:04.720
<v Speaker 4>flaws,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1332
01:14:05.220 --> 01:14:07.740
<v Speaker 4>because it's of course dealing with an </v>
<v Speaker 4>impossible problem,</v>

1333
01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:12.460
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>still uses much less of its capital</v>

1334
01:14:12.580 --> 01:14:15.010
<v Speaker 5>on maintaining itself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And for example,</v>

1335
01:14:15.170 --> 01:14:16.003
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>having to maintain an infrastructure </v>

1336
01:14:17.981 --> 01:14:18.814
<v Speaker 5>that collects money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know that the hospitals in the u s </v>

1337
01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:22.353
<v Speaker 5>spend something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some substantial proportion of the </v>

1338
01:14:24.371 --> 01:14:26.680
<v Speaker 5>revenue,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't remember precisely,</v>

1339
01:14:26.681 --> 01:14:29.770
<v Speaker 5>but it's between 17 and 30%,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I remember correctly.</v>

1340
01:14:30.010 --> 01:14:33.370
<v Speaker 5>Just gathering the money for their </v>
<v Speaker 5>services,</v>

1341
01:14:33.610 --> 01:14:35.910
<v Speaker 5>which seems to be rather counter </v>
<v Speaker 5>productive use of the [inaudible]</v>

1342
01:14:35.930 --> 01:14:39.520
<v Speaker 4>resources.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder how much is spent on billboards</v>

1343
01:14:39.521 --> 01:14:43.550
<v Speaker 4>advertising their hospitals to drive the</v>
<v Speaker 4>interstate highways of the,</v>

1344
01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:48.610
<v Speaker 4>it's astonishing how much</v>
<v Speaker 4>information about,</v>

1345
01:14:48.750 --> 01:14:49.583
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cub to such and such where we have the </v>

1346
01:14:51.191 --> 01:14:55.390
<v Speaker 4>best cancer doctors that it isn't well </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the,</v>

1347
01:14:55.420 --> 01:14:57.520
<v Speaker 4>and Americans pay a lot for their </v>
<v Speaker 4>healthcare.</v>

1348
01:14:58.150 --> 01:14:59.640
<v Speaker 4>They do it easily.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did they do indeed.</v>

1349
01:14:59.670 --> 01:15:02.610
<v Speaker 4>I spent three years there recently and </v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1350
01:15:03.100 --> 01:15:03.933
<v Speaker 4>we paid a lot for healthcare coverage </v>
<v Speaker 4>that turned out not in fact to be held </v>

1351
01:15:08.721 --> 01:15:10.930
<v Speaker 4>up thorough a coverage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1352
01:15:10.931 --> 01:15:12.310
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I lived in the states do,</v>

1353
01:15:12.311 --> 01:15:13.144
<v Speaker 4>and I have decent coverage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was teaching in Boston there I had a </v>

1354
01:15:16.211 --> 01:15:17.950
<v Speaker 4>pretty good program,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it wasn't,</v>

1355
01:15:18.070 --> 01:15:18.950
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't say it was</v>

1356
01:15:19.060 --> 01:15:22.240
<v Speaker 5>manifestly different from my Canadian </v>
<v Speaker 5>experience,</v>

1357
01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:23.193
<v Speaker 5>which has been mixed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But of course it is very important to </v>

1358
01:15:25.751 --> 01:15:26.584
<v Speaker 5>note that hell that making people </v>
<v Speaker 5>healthy is impossible because everybody </v>

1359
01:15:30.340 --> 01:15:33.580
<v Speaker 5>gets sick and ages and dies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so it's an impossible task.</v>

1360
01:15:33.581 --> 01:15:34.414
<v Speaker 5>And it also indicates to me that that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>perhaps one of the reasons why it </v>

1361
01:15:37.391 --> 01:15:38.224
<v Speaker 5>doesn't fit so nicely into a free market</v>
<v Speaker 5>model because the free market assumes </v>

1362
01:15:43.151 --> 01:15:43.984
<v Speaker 5>that there's not infinite demand for </v>
<v Speaker 5>something and there is actually near </v>

1363
01:15:46.571 --> 01:15:48.100
<v Speaker 5>infinite demand for healthcare,</v>

1364
01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:51.650
<v Speaker 4>especially if they're dying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's that and there's also just,</v>

1365
01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:52.400
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1366
01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:55.490
<v Speaker 4>it's an impossible problem because of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the aging population.</v>

1367
01:15:55.491 --> 01:15:58.850
<v Speaker 4>It's an impossible problem because you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

1368
01:15:58.851 --> 01:16:03.851
<v Speaker 4>governments have one of the determinants</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the costs of the healthcare system is</v>

1369
01:16:03.951 --> 01:16:04.784
<v Speaker 4>held many empties.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got out there billing it and </v>

1370
01:16:06.470 --> 01:16:07.303
<v Speaker 4>governments have a tendency to one </v>
<v Speaker 4>respond to this by restricting the </v>

1371
01:16:12.471 --> 01:16:14.690
<v Speaker 4>number of new medics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1372
01:16:15.140 --> 01:16:18.020
<v Speaker 4>so as to restrict that a birth people </v>
<v Speaker 4>billing,</v>

1373
01:16:18.021 --> 01:16:18.854
<v Speaker 4>but this is not much of a solution but </v>
<v Speaker 4>you have large numbers of people try to </v>

1374
01:16:21.831 --> 01:16:23.900
<v Speaker 4>find a family doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just successfully,</v>

1375
01:16:24.860 --> 01:16:25.693
<v Speaker 4>okay so there is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is some meritocratic structure </v>

1376
01:16:28.831 --> 01:16:28.900
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

1377
01:16:28.900 --> 01:16:29.733
<v Speaker 5>To our society in so far as Iq </v>
<v Speaker 5>conscientiousness and openness predict </v>

1378
01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:34.713
<v Speaker 5>longterm life success.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's a good thing because that's </v>

1379
01:16:36.611 --> 01:16:39.220
<v Speaker 5>an indicator of of health and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>society.</v>

1380
01:16:39.250 --> 01:16:44.250
<v Speaker 5>I would say it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's if your society is set up to,</v>

1381
01:16:44.890 --> 01:16:45.723
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to allow people who are intelligent and </v>

1382
01:16:48.431 --> 01:16:51.880
<v Speaker 5>conscientious nearer the pinnacles of </v>
<v Speaker 5>power structures,</v>

1383
01:16:51.881 --> 01:16:52.714
<v Speaker 5>that's a good thing for everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now you could still have an argument </v>

1384
01:16:54.851 --> 01:16:57.370
<v Speaker 5>about how steep that gradient it should </v>
<v Speaker 5>be.</v>

1385
01:16:57.840 --> 01:17:02.080
<v Speaker 5>But then with regards to the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to the guaranteed annual income issue,</v>

1386
01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:03.873
<v Speaker 5>I'm also concerned that the importance </v>
<v Speaker 5>of individual differences there are not </v>

1387
01:17:07.871 --> 01:17:09.710
<v Speaker 5>being considered.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So for example,</v>

1388
01:17:10.730 --> 01:17:14.000
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what people who are </v>
<v Speaker 5>extremely low in conscientiousness would</v>

1389
01:17:14.001 --> 01:17:18.080
<v Speaker 5>do with an annual income because they're</v>
<v Speaker 5>not inclined to work.</v>

1390
01:17:18.081 --> 01:17:18.914
<v Speaker 5>And it isn't obvious to me that </v>
<v Speaker 5>providing them with an easy way out is </v>

1391
01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:25.070
<v Speaker 5>the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because providing unconscientious people</v>

1392
01:17:25.071 --> 01:17:28.010
<v Speaker 5>with an easy way out seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>actually quite counterproductive.</v>

1393
01:17:28.220 --> 01:17:29.870
<v Speaker 5>And conscientiousness is a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1394
01:17:29.871 --> 01:17:32.150
<v Speaker 5>it's a decent predictor of longterm </v>
<v Speaker 5>success.</v>

1395
01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:35.990
<v Speaker 5>And we also don't know to what degree </v>
<v Speaker 5>necessity is a motivator,</v>

1396
01:17:35.991 --> 01:17:37.850
<v Speaker 5>which is of course the conservative </v>
<v Speaker 5>argument.</v>

1397
01:17:38.330 --> 01:17:39.980
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

1398
01:17:39.981 --> 01:17:40.814
<v Speaker 5>and we also don't know how homogenous </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's and small as society has to be </v>

1399
01:17:44.361 --> 01:17:47.900
<v Speaker 5>before income redistribution programs </v>
<v Speaker 5>will actually be successful.</v>

1400
01:17:48.110 --> 01:17:52.130
<v Speaker 5>It seems easier to implement them in </v>
<v Speaker 5>relatively homogenous societies like the</v>

1401
01:17:52.131 --> 01:17:54.560
<v Speaker 5>Scandinavian countries or the G or </v>
<v Speaker 5>Japan,</v>

1402
01:17:54.590 --> 01:17:58.520
<v Speaker 5>which is where they tend to have been </v>
<v Speaker 5>implemented with more success.</v>

1403
01:17:58.730 --> 01:18:01.310
<v Speaker 5>So that's a con complicated phenomena as</v>
<v Speaker 5>well.</v>

1404
01:18:01.940 --> 01:18:02.773
<v Speaker 5>And then the other thing that's really </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to come up on his heart in the </v>

1405
01:18:05.421 --> 01:18:07.400
<v Speaker 5>next 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would say,</v>

1406
01:18:07.850 --> 01:18:08.683
<v Speaker 5>this is how it looks to me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that I think computational devices </v>

1407
01:18:12.171 --> 01:18:15.500
<v Speaker 5>are a multiplier of intelligence and </v>
<v Speaker 5>conscientiousness.</v>

1408
01:18:16.190 --> 01:18:21.170
<v Speaker 5>Because if you're smart and you know how</v>
<v Speaker 5>to use a computer and your diligence,</v>

1409
01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:22.033
<v Speaker 5>so as conscientious person would be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then you're much more deadly than you </v>

1410
01:18:26.391 --> 01:18:29.360
<v Speaker 5>would be without your computer because </v>
<v Speaker 5>it multiplies your,</v>

1411
01:18:29.390 --> 01:18:30.223
<v Speaker 5>and there's a huge difference between </v>
<v Speaker 5>someone who really knows how to use a </v>

1412
01:18:32.481 --> 01:18:34.490
<v Speaker 5>computer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>including knowing how to program it.</v>

1413
01:18:35.390 --> 01:18:36.620
<v Speaker 5>The someone who's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1414
01:18:36.650 --> 01:18:40.070
<v Speaker 5>literate enough to use their ipad to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to do a google search.</v>

1415
01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:43.550
<v Speaker 5>And so I think one of the things that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>also driving inequality,</v>

1416
01:18:43.610 --> 01:18:45.980
<v Speaker 5>particularly in societies like the </v>
<v Speaker 5>United States,</v>

1417
01:18:45.981 --> 01:18:46.814
<v Speaker 5>is that increasingly people who are </v>
<v Speaker 5>smart and conscientious can do a </v>

1418
01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:52.910
<v Speaker 5>tremendous amount of work without having</v>
<v Speaker 5>to hire anyone.</v>

1419
01:18:53.660 --> 01:18:54.493
<v Speaker 5>So we have these tiny companies that </v>
<v Speaker 5>employ almost no one that gathered </v>

1420
01:18:57.611 --> 01:19:01.490
<v Speaker 5>massive resources to themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's going to be a problem.</v>

1421
01:19:01.850 --> 01:19:03.080
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's a good example.</v>

1422
01:19:03.081 --> 01:19:05.540
<v Speaker 5>Here's one of the thing that's coming.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

1423
01:19:05.541 --> 01:19:06.374
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Tesla guys are working pretty hard </v>

1424
01:19:07.641 --> 01:19:08.474
<v Speaker 5>on autonomous vehicles and then make it </v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of progress and they're not the </v>

1425
01:19:11.241 --> 01:19:12.380
<v Speaker 5>only one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So obviously,</v>

1426
01:19:12.710 --> 01:19:13.543
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the biggest employer for males in North </v>

1427
01:19:15.021 --> 01:19:18.560
<v Speaker 5>America is as driver.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't.</v>

1428
01:19:19.090 --> 01:19:19.780
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1429
01:19:19.780 --> 01:19:20.613
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the biggest single employment </v>

1430
01:19:21.561 --> 01:19:23.030
<v Speaker 5>category.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

1431
01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:24.300
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're,</v>

1432
01:19:24.380 --> 01:19:25.250
<v Speaker 5>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're,</v>

1433
01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:26.353
<v Speaker 5>we're increasingly eradicating the </v>
<v Speaker 5>possibility for people who are on the </v>

1434
01:19:30.231 --> 01:19:31.064
<v Speaker 5>lower end of the intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 5>distribution and the lower end of the </v>

1435
01:19:33.531 --> 01:19:38.030
<v Speaker 5>conscientiousness distribution to find a</v>
<v Speaker 5>place in society.</v>

1436
01:19:38.031 --> 01:19:39.860
<v Speaker 5>And it's possible that providing them </v>
<v Speaker 5>with,</v>

1437
01:19:39.970 --> 01:19:43.850
<v Speaker 5>with minimal resources to survive might </v>
<v Speaker 5>be sufficient to solve that problem.</v>

1438
01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:46.190
<v Speaker 5>But I doubt it because as they say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1439
01:19:46.191 --> 01:19:50.720
<v Speaker 5>man does not live on bread alone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it seems to me that people need that</v>

1440
01:19:50.721 --> 01:19:51.554
<v Speaker 5>quest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The degree to which people need to find </v>

1441
01:19:53.481 --> 01:19:54.314
<v Speaker 5>a productive and credible place in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>functional society is something that we </v>

1442
01:19:57.921 --> 01:20:00.650
<v Speaker 5>haven't yet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We don't know the parameters of that.</v>

1443
01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:01.993
<v Speaker 5>They'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1444
01:20:02.220 --> 01:20:03.760
<v Speaker 5>I don't disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1445
01:20:03.761 --> 01:20:04.461
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1446
01:20:04.461 --> 01:20:08.370
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of course the loss of decently</v>

1447
01:20:08.370 --> 01:20:09.203
<v Speaker 4>paid work of and two dates,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they beige or computer revolution to </v>

1448
01:20:14.451 --> 01:20:15.840
<v Speaker 4>some extent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or at least the,</v>

1449
01:20:15.850 --> 01:20:18.030
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1450
01:20:18.450 --> 01:20:22.950
<v Speaker 4>modern electronic device and your phone </v>
<v Speaker 4>could do everything revolution.</v>

1451
01:20:23.310 --> 01:20:25.350
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I live in Hamilton,</v>

1452
01:20:25.351 --> 01:20:26.184
<v Speaker 4>Ontario,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where were former whale watch bucket </v>

1453
01:20:29.491 --> 01:20:30.450
<v Speaker 4>taub with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1454
01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:35.190
<v Speaker 4>with an enormous number of people </v>
<v Speaker 4>working in decently paid,</v>

1455
01:20:36.460 --> 01:20:39.060
<v Speaker 4>working class jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And those jobs,</v>

1456
01:20:39.061 --> 01:20:39.894
<v Speaker 4>but evaporating and pay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If drivers evaporators work is going to </v>

1457
01:20:47.340 --> 01:20:49.800
<v Speaker 4>change work opportunities are going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>change.</v>

1458
01:20:49.801 --> 01:20:50.634
<v Speaker 4>And I take your point that people need </v>
<v Speaker 4>something that they can think of as </v>

1459
01:20:55.290 --> 01:20:58.980
<v Speaker 4>useful work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Useful work.</v>

1460
01:20:59.220 --> 01:21:00.400
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's interesting we're talking,</v>

1461
01:21:00.420 --> 01:21:01.253
<v Speaker 4>we're two males talking about this and </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're probably thinking from a sub what </v>

1462
01:21:03.601 --> 01:21:04.434
<v Speaker 4>bail perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of useful work that is </v>

1463
01:21:07.050 --> 01:21:11.610
<v Speaker 4>minimally or not at all comp compensated</v>
<v Speaker 4>than a predominantly female don't maids,</v>

1464
01:21:11.930 --> 01:21:14.250
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>daycare kinds of things,</v>

1465
01:21:14.510 --> 01:21:16.950
<v Speaker 4>various so called charitable activities </v>
<v Speaker 4>and so on.</v>

1466
01:21:17.460 --> 01:21:19.530
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1467
01:21:19.590 --> 01:21:20.423
<v Speaker 4>the idea that people need something to </v>
<v Speaker 4>occupy their time with that feels </v>

1468
01:21:24.451 --> 01:21:25.284
<v Speaker 4>worthwhile.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That editors have been twist social </v>

1469
01:21:26.701 --> 01:21:28.740
<v Speaker 4>arena where they engage with other </v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

1470
01:21:28.980 --> 01:21:29.813
<v Speaker 4>that they come home satisfied,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they've done something useful and </v>

1471
01:21:32.131 --> 01:21:32.964
<v Speaker 4>they also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't have a chicken in every pot </v>

1472
01:21:34.891 --> 01:21:37.950
<v Speaker 4>besides I need a work opportunities </v>
<v Speaker 4>shrink.</v>

1473
01:21:38.370 --> 01:21:42.190
<v Speaker 4>And if the next mark Zuckerberg kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>play a hundred people to pull,</v>

1474
01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:45.030
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tens of billions of dollars,</v>

1475
01:21:45.540 --> 01:21:48.070
<v Speaker 4>then where's that gonna come from?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is,</v>

1476
01:21:48.210 --> 01:21:49.043
<v Speaker 4>it may come from various sorts of unpaid</v>
<v Speaker 4>work with a guaranteed cub that you </v>

1477
01:21:55.450 --> 01:21:56.283
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>enables that work to be paid and still </v>

1478
01:21:57.961 --> 01:21:59.760
<v Speaker 4>be fulfilling?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1479
01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:02.360
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well that's a good thing to think about.</v>

1480
01:22:02.361 --> 01:22:03.050
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe,</v>

1481
01:22:03.050 --> 01:22:03.883
<v Speaker 5>maybe people will learn how to go out </v>
<v Speaker 5>into the community and spontaneously do </v>

1482
01:22:07.881 --> 01:22:08.714
<v Speaker 5>useful things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Although I can tell you that my </v>

1483
01:22:10.911 --> 01:22:13.570
<v Speaker 5>experience trying to find gainful,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1484
01:22:13.670 --> 01:22:14.503
<v Speaker 5>let's call it volunteer employments for </v>
<v Speaker 5>people who are on the lower end of the </v>

1485
01:22:17.661 --> 01:22:20.480
<v Speaker 5>ability distribution has been </v>
<v Speaker 5>absolutely,</v>

1486
01:22:20.900 --> 01:22:22.390
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1487
01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:23.233
<v Speaker 5>it's difficult beyond imagination </v>
<v Speaker 5>because it turns out that finding a </v>

1488
01:22:26.211 --> 01:22:29.120
<v Speaker 5>volunteer position is actually no less </v>
<v Speaker 5>difficult.</v>

1489
01:22:29.121 --> 01:22:30.740
<v Speaker 5>And finding a job,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

1490
01:22:30.741 --> 01:22:31.574
<v Speaker 5>you have to go through a relatively </v>
<v Speaker 5>complicated process of police screening </v>

1491
01:22:34.580 --> 01:22:35.413
<v Speaker 5>for most jobs and you have to produce a </v>
<v Speaker 5>resume and you have to be able to work </v>

1492
01:22:37.881 --> 01:22:38.714
<v Speaker 5>in an office environment and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you need to have all the abilities that </v>

1493
01:22:41.541 --> 01:22:44.480
<v Speaker 5>you would have if you were actually </v>
<v Speaker 5>having a real job.</v>

1494
01:22:44.930 --> 01:22:47.930
<v Speaker 5>And so that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that makes things complicated as well.</v>

1495
01:22:48.330 --> 01:22:49.470
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1496
01:22:49.471 --> 01:22:50.304
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to come back also to what you </v>

1497
01:22:51.301 --> 01:22:56.190
<v Speaker 4>were saying about the predictive power </v>
<v Speaker 4>of Iq and conscientiousness,</v>

1498
01:22:56.191 --> 01:22:59.280
<v Speaker 4>which I don't dispute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm also not one of these people who</v>

1499
01:22:59.281 --> 01:23:03.150
<v Speaker 4>suffers that the delusion that these </v>
<v Speaker 4>things are totally open quotes,</v>

1500
01:23:03.151 --> 01:23:04.980
<v Speaker 4>socially determined,</v>
<v Speaker 4>close quotes.</v>

1501
01:23:04.990 --> 01:23:05.823
<v Speaker 4>I mean I understand and believe that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they have high heritability at </v>

1502
01:23:09.131 --> 01:23:13.570
<v Speaker 4>identifiable genetic sources in that </v>
<v Speaker 4>variability and so on.</v>

1503
01:23:13.900 --> 01:23:16.240
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the standard old joke used to be,</v>

1504
01:23:16.241 --> 01:23:19.070
<v Speaker 4>you can tell me because you know more </v>
<v Speaker 4>about personality psychology that I do,</v>

1505
01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:21.970
<v Speaker 4>the standard old junk used to be that </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything's 50% heritable.</v>

1506
01:23:22.290 --> 01:23:23.123
<v Speaker 4>That uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1507
01:23:23.340 --> 01:23:24.173
<v Speaker 4>that pretty much anything that you could</v>
<v Speaker 4>measure as a trait that has any </v>

1508
01:23:27.011 --> 01:23:27.844
<v Speaker 4>stability within the lifetime also turns</v>
<v Speaker 4>out to have a heritability somewhere to </v>

1509
01:23:30.851 --> 01:23:35.851
<v Speaker 4>your 0.5.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there's the other 0.5 of,</v>

1510
01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:37.233
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some people have low iqs because they </v>

1511
01:23:40.541 --> 01:23:42.910
<v Speaker 4>were exposed to two buck chuck </v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible].</v>

1512
01:23:43.220 --> 01:23:44.710
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1513
01:23:44.711 --> 01:23:48.140
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe that conscientiousness,</v>

1514
01:23:48.150 --> 01:23:50.220
<v Speaker 4>this can probably be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1515
01:23:50.930 --> 01:23:51.763
<v Speaker 4>like I believe you suggested earlier </v>
<v Speaker 4>that we know something about this </v>

1516
01:23:54.311 --> 01:23:56.840
<v Speaker 4>already about developmental determinants</v>
<v Speaker 4>of swell,</v>

1517
01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:00.460
<v Speaker 4>of shifts in conscientiousness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1518
01:24:00.461 --> 01:24:01.630
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

1519
01:24:02.110 --> 01:24:02.943
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have to caution ourselves against </v>

1520
01:24:04.451 --> 01:24:05.284
<v Speaker 4>talking about these individual </v>
<v Speaker 4>difference factors as if they are a </v>

1521
01:24:08.191 --> 01:24:09.024
<v Speaker 4>beautiful attributes of individuals that</v>
<v Speaker 4>are going to undermine any sort of </v>

1522
01:24:14.500 --> 01:24:18.170
<v Speaker 4>progressive improvement of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of that just for people who are,</v>

1523
01:24:18.171 --> 01:24:18.601
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>

1524
01:24:18.601 --> 01:24:19.340
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>

1525
01:24:19.340 --> 01:24:24.340
<v Speaker 4>are going to create bad byproducts of </v>
<v Speaker 4>attempts to produce social justice.</v>

1526
01:24:25.091 --> 01:24:27.020
<v Speaker 4>It's just going to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to leave here,</v>

1527
01:24:27.290 --> 01:24:31.030
<v Speaker 4>you're dumb and Kanchi it just people </v>
<v Speaker 4>out there being parasites or something.</v>

1528
01:24:31.470 --> 01:24:32.020
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1529
01:24:32.020 --> 01:24:33.190
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>

1530
01:24:33.260 --> 01:24:38.260
<v Speaker 5>there is of course decent evidence that </v>
<v Speaker 5>their socio cultural effects on Iq,</v>

1531
01:24:39.051 --> 01:24:39.884
<v Speaker 5>I mean the flynn effect,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is named after the man who </v>

1532
01:24:43.820 --> 01:24:45.320
<v Speaker 5>described the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1533
01:24:45.340 --> 01:24:46.173
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the phenomenon indicates that the </v>

1534
01:24:48.201 --> 01:24:49.034
<v Speaker 5>average Iq has been increasing quite </v>
<v Speaker 5>substantially over the last hundred </v>

1535
01:24:52.970 --> 01:24:54.140
<v Speaker 5>years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the reason for that,</v>

1536
01:24:55.130 --> 01:24:58.400
<v Speaker 5>no one knows for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But one of the putative reasons for that</v>

1537
01:24:58.401 --> 01:25:02.330
<v Speaker 5>is that we've lifted the bottom out of </v>
<v Speaker 5>catastrophe.</v>

1538
01:25:02.780 --> 01:25:05.780
<v Speaker 5>So there aren't people whose iqs are </v>
<v Speaker 5>stunted by,</v>

1539
01:25:06.110 --> 01:25:06.943
<v Speaker 5>by exposure to zero information during </v>
<v Speaker 5>critical developmental periods and who </v>

1540
01:25:11.451 --> 01:25:12.650
<v Speaker 5>didn't get enough to eat.</v>

1541
01:25:13.180 --> 01:25:14.013
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause I was gonna say Superior Bell </v>

1542
01:25:15.210 --> 01:25:16.510
<v Speaker 4>Nutrition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody there a probation.</v>

1543
01:25:16.511 --> 01:25:16.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1544
01:25:16.930 --> 01:25:17.591
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>

1545
01:25:17.591 --> 01:25:18.520
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we've,</v>

1546
01:25:18.700 --> 01:25:19.533
<v Speaker 5>we've wiped out in many ways,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we've wiped out the worst effects of </v>

1547
01:25:23.081 --> 01:25:26.560
<v Speaker 5>privation and that's increasingly true </v>
<v Speaker 5>as well.</v>

1548
01:25:26.561 --> 01:25:31.360
<v Speaker 5>On,</v>
<v Speaker 5>on the worldwide scale worldwide stage.</v>

1549
01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:34.390
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's about 150,000 people a day right</v>

1550
01:25:34.391 --> 01:25:38.020
<v Speaker 5>now being lifted out of absolute poverty</v>
<v Speaker 5>by UN standards,</v>

1551
01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:38.913
<v Speaker 5>the fastest improvement in the history </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the world by a huge margin and also </v>

1552
01:25:41.861 --> 01:25:45.610
<v Speaker 5>about 300,000 people a day being hooked </v>
<v Speaker 5>up to the electrical grid.</v>

1553
01:25:45.970 --> 01:25:50.800
<v Speaker 5>So we are making some progress,</v>
<v Speaker 5>removing the absolute privation problem,</v>

1554
01:25:50.801 --> 01:25:55.060
<v Speaker 5>which is a nontrivial problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The problem with most of the attempts to</v>

1555
01:25:55.061 --> 01:25:58.840
<v Speaker 5>raise Iq is that they don't change the </v>
<v Speaker 5>variance in Iq.</v>

1556
01:25:58.841 --> 01:25:59.674
<v Speaker 5>They tend to raise the average Iq across</v>
<v Speaker 5>the population and that leaves the </v>

1557
01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:06.680
<v Speaker 5>inequality I Iq inequality problem,</v>
<v Speaker 5>basically untouched.</v>

1558
01:26:06.681 --> 01:26:11.681
<v Speaker 5>So there have been studies trying to </v>
<v Speaker 5>estimate how much socioeconomic,</v>

1559
01:26:12.110 --> 01:26:13.100
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pressure,</v>

1560
01:26:13.101 --> 01:26:18.101
<v Speaker 5>let's say you have to place on an </v>
<v Speaker 5>individual to raise their iq lowering.</v>

1561
01:26:18.260 --> 01:26:19.660
<v Speaker 5>It's easy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1562
01:26:19.940 --> 01:26:23.150
<v Speaker 5>Because making something worse is always</v>
<v Speaker 5>easier than making something better.</v>

1563
01:26:23.350 --> 01:26:26.660
<v Speaker 5>But if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you take a,</v>

1564
01:26:26.810 --> 01:26:27.643
<v Speaker 5>an identical twin who's adopted out at </v>
<v Speaker 5>birth in order to produce a 15 point </v>

1565
01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:34.610
<v Speaker 5>increase in Iq compared to the other </v>
<v Speaker 5>twin,</v>

1566
01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:36.313
<v Speaker 5>which is a one standard deviation </v>
<v Speaker 5>increase and about the same as the </v>

1567
01:26:38.661 --> 01:26:42.400
<v Speaker 5>average difference between a university </v>
<v Speaker 5>student in,</v>

1568
01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:45.410
<v Speaker 5>in an average state college and an </v>
<v Speaker 5>average high school student,</v>

1569
01:26:45.710 --> 01:26:50.710
<v Speaker 5>you have to move the one twin from the </v>
<v Speaker 5>fifth percentile of socioeconomic status</v>

1570
01:26:51.231 --> 01:26:52.064
<v Speaker 5>to the 95th percentile.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you need about a three standard </v>

1571
01:26:55.101 --> 01:26:55.934
<v Speaker 5>deviation improvement and socioeconomic </v>
<v Speaker 5>conditions to produce a one standard </v>

1572
01:26:59.481 --> 01:27:03.320
<v Speaker 5>deviation improvement in Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it looks like it can be done,</v>

1573
01:27:03.321 --> 01:27:05.210
<v Speaker 5>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's expensive,</v>

1574
01:27:05.690 --> 01:27:06.523
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and</v>

1575
01:27:06.770 --> 01:27:07.870
<v Speaker 4>I see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see what you're saying.</v>

1576
01:27:07.871 --> 01:27:11.590
<v Speaker 4>I'm kind of surprised</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually.</v>

1577
01:27:11.591 --> 01:27:12.424
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>given,</v>

1578
01:27:12.430 --> 01:27:13.263
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we just mentioned bell nutrition as one </v>

1579
01:27:14.471 --> 01:27:17.830
<v Speaker 4>possible source of low Iq one possible </v>
<v Speaker 4>developmental source.</v>

1580
01:27:17.831 --> 01:27:19.390
<v Speaker 4>I'm kind of surprised that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1581
01:27:19.690 --> 01:27:22.720
<v Speaker 4>to the degree that the flynn effect </v>
<v Speaker 4>might be due to things like,</v>

1582
01:27:22.721 --> 01:27:25.720
<v Speaker 4>or reduction of the number of people </v>
<v Speaker 4>exposed to severe malnutrition,</v>

1583
01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:30.520
<v Speaker 4>that wouldn't have also simultaneously </v>
<v Speaker 4>truncated the variance a little bit.</v>

1584
01:27:30.720 --> 01:27:32.460
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that seems like they said,</v>

1585
01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:35.300
<v Speaker 5>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let me restate that.</v>

1586
01:27:35.450 --> 01:27:38.270
<v Speaker 5>It has truncated,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it has truncated the variance,</v>

1587
01:27:38.271 --> 01:27:41.630
<v Speaker 5>although the data on that isn't clear </v>
<v Speaker 5>isn't as clear.</v>

1588
01:27:42.110 --> 01:27:42.943
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

1589
01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:43.833
<v Speaker 5>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do believe that it's a reasonable </v>

1590
01:27:45.051 --> 01:27:47.030
<v Speaker 5>inference to make that the variance has </v>
<v Speaker 5>been truncated.</v>

1591
01:27:47.031 --> 01:27:47.864
<v Speaker 5>It's also hidden to some degree because </v>
<v Speaker 5>the Iq tests are always renew warm to </v>

1592
01:27:51.021 --> 01:27:53.430
<v Speaker 5>keep the variance set of standard 15 </v>
<v Speaker 5>points.</v>

1593
01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:54.170
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

1594
01:27:54.170 --> 01:27:55.003
<v Speaker 5>so it makes it difficult to look </v>
<v Speaker 5>retrospectively and see what's happened </v>

1595
01:27:58.191 --> 01:27:59.930
<v Speaker 5>to the variance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

1596
01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:01.153
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1597
01:28:01.490 --> 01:28:03.020
<v Speaker 5>the other problem too is that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1598
01:28:03.021 --> 01:28:03.854
<v Speaker 5>you get these stories now and then about</v>
<v Speaker 5>these companies that come out with the </v>

1599
01:28:05.921 --> 01:28:06.754
<v Speaker 5>claims that their brain exercises can </v>
<v Speaker 5>improve Iq in the literature on that is </v>

1600
01:28:10.221 --> 01:28:11.054
<v Speaker 5>damn dismal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can tell you it's that the holy grail </v>

1601
01:28:13.521 --> 01:28:14.354
<v Speaker 5>is to produce cognitive exercises that </v>
<v Speaker 5>produce a legitimate impact on fluid </v>

1602
01:28:17.961 --> 01:28:19.670
<v Speaker 5>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And like,</v>

1603
01:28:19.700 --> 01:28:21.470
<v Speaker 5>there has been a lot of work down on </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

1604
01:28:21.471 --> 01:28:24.410
<v Speaker 5>And the answer is so far is that it </v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't work.</v>

1605
01:28:24.820 --> 01:28:27.330
<v Speaker 4>So what about the game?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What about the video gaming?</v>

1606
01:28:27.350 --> 01:28:28.183
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know there has been a suggestion that </v>

1607
01:28:29.411 --> 01:28:34.000
<v Speaker 4>playing video games actually improves at</v>
<v Speaker 4>least sub aspects of intelligence.</v>

1608
01:28:34.300 --> 01:28:37.270
<v Speaker 4>There's a couple of studies that </v>
<v Speaker 4>indicated that video games might improve</v>

1609
01:28:37.271 --> 01:28:38.580
<v Speaker 4>spatial intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

1610
01:28:39.250 --> 01:28:41.320
<v Speaker 5>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think this is,</v>

1611
01:28:41.350 --> 01:28:42.183
<v Speaker 5>this is a critical problem or apps,</v>
<v Speaker 5>an insoluble one or at least no one's </v>

1612
01:28:45.841 --> 01:28:48.230
<v Speaker 5>solved it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that what you get is that if you,</v>

1613
01:28:48.380 --> 01:28:51.670
<v Speaker 5>if you exercise yourself substantially </v>
<v Speaker 5>on a given game,</v>

1614
01:28:51.671 --> 01:28:54.190
<v Speaker 5>you can radically accelerate your </v>
<v Speaker 5>performance in the game.</v>

1615
01:28:54.370 --> 01:28:57.040
<v Speaker 5>So you can get much better at those </v>
<v Speaker 5>specific skill share.</v>

1616
01:28:57.041 --> 01:29:00.370
<v Speaker 5>But you don't get generalization across </v>
<v Speaker 5>cognitive sets,</v>

1617
01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:02.610
<v Speaker 5>which is what really hoping for because </v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought,</v>

1618
01:29:02.611 --> 01:29:04.230
<v Speaker 5>I thought that was the claim from </v>
<v Speaker 5>somebody.</v>

1619
01:29:04.740 --> 01:29:07.530
<v Speaker 5>They have shown some increases in </v>
<v Speaker 5>spatial Iq,</v>

1620
01:29:07.531 --> 01:29:08.364
<v Speaker 5>but there's not very many studies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I would say they're far over </v>

1621
01:29:11.211 --> 01:29:14.760
<v Speaker 5>balanced by the other side of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>research equation,</v>

1622
01:29:14.761 --> 01:29:15.594
<v Speaker 5>which continually says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I've looked at this because I'm </v>

1623
01:29:17.851 --> 01:29:20.730
<v Speaker 5>really interested in the improvement of </v>
<v Speaker 5>Iq.</v>

1624
01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:23.160
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the holy grail in some sense.</v>

1625
01:29:23.161 --> 01:29:24.480
<v Speaker 5>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

1626
01:29:24.540 --> 01:29:25.373
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1627
01:29:26.250 --> 01:29:27.170
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1628
01:29:27.380 --> 01:29:28.213
<v Speaker 5>the overwhelming preponderance of </v>
<v Speaker 5>evidence suggests that you don't get </v>

1629
01:29:31.141 --> 01:29:33.660
<v Speaker 5>generalization outside the narrow </v>
<v Speaker 5>domain.</v>

1630
01:29:34.140 --> 01:29:35.940
<v Speaker 5>Now why that is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and even this,</v>

1631
01:29:35.941 --> 01:29:36.830
<v Speaker 5>it's even worse,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

1632
01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:37.830
<v Speaker 5>because you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1633
01:29:38.280 --> 01:29:39.113
<v Speaker 5>imagine that you could take five </v>
<v Speaker 5>different domains of intelligence still </v>

1634
01:29:42.360 --> 01:29:43.193
<v Speaker 5>associated type with the g and you had </v>
<v Speaker 5>people practice routines in all five </v>

1635
01:29:48.241 --> 01:29:49.074
<v Speaker 5>dimensions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe you'd get generalization under </v>

1636
01:29:50.941 --> 01:29:53.010
<v Speaker 5>those circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the,</v>

1637
01:29:53.100 --> 01:29:53.933
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the results of the research attempting </v>

1638
01:29:55.801 --> 01:29:56.634
<v Speaker 5>that indicate that no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as soon as you move away from those </v>

1639
01:29:58.411 --> 01:30:01.680
<v Speaker 5>specific practice instances,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't get generalization.</v>

1640
01:30:02.020 --> 01:30:02.940
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1641
01:30:03.170 --> 01:30:05.300
<v Speaker 4>I guess it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess the subways,</v>

1642
01:30:05.780 --> 01:30:06.613
<v Speaker 4>some of this is to be expected from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>consideration that everything is an </v>

1643
01:30:09.171 --> 01:30:13.100
<v Speaker 4>allocation problem with it within the </v>
<v Speaker 4>body at Brae in,</v>

1644
01:30:13.101 --> 01:30:13.934
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1645
01:30:14.210 --> 01:30:15.200
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1646
01:30:15.201 --> 01:30:16.034
<v Speaker 4>by a large,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an approvement blood domain tends to be </v>

1647
01:30:20.721 --> 01:30:24.790
<v Speaker 4>bought at the expense of something else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1648
01:30:25.970 --> 01:30:26.803
<v Speaker 4>just that.</v>

1649
01:30:27.140 --> 01:30:29.240
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then conscientiousness,</v>

1650
01:30:29.270 --> 01:30:31.670
<v Speaker 5>I can tell you some research we've done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's cool.</v>

1651
01:30:31.940 --> 01:30:32.773
<v Speaker 5>Although we haven't been able to </v>
<v Speaker 5>demonstrate that it's actually improved </v>

1652
01:30:34.911 --> 01:30:35.744
<v Speaker 5>conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the first thing to note about </v>

1653
01:30:37.251 --> 01:30:39.860
<v Speaker 5>conscientiousness is that no one </v>
<v Speaker 5>understands it at all.</v>

1654
01:30:40.370 --> 01:30:44.750
<v Speaker 5>Especially the industriousness element.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no plausible biological,</v>

1655
01:30:44.751 --> 01:30:49.370
<v Speaker 5>psychological neurophysiological or </v>
<v Speaker 5>animal models for conscientiousness.</v>

1656
01:30:49.850 --> 01:30:50.683
<v Speaker 5>All we've got is self reports.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We can't even find tasks that </v>

1657
01:30:53.061 --> 01:30:56.300
<v Speaker 5>conscientious people do better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's unbelievable.</v>

1658
01:30:56.900 --> 01:31:00.330
<v Speaker 5>But I'm self reports really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Also freeport,</v>

1659
01:31:00.380 --> 01:31:03.200
<v Speaker 5>well you can get reports from teachers </v>
<v Speaker 5>and parents and so forth,</v>

1660
01:31:03.201 --> 01:31:05.040
<v Speaker 5>but it's all human report.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1661
01:31:05.220 --> 01:31:06.053
<v Speaker 5>The only way we can measure it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and we know like in my lab we probably </v>

1662
01:31:08.421 --> 01:31:12.050
<v Speaker 5>tried 200 tasks trying to find something</v>
<v Speaker 5>that conscientiousness,</v>

1663
01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:14.570
<v Speaker 5>conscientious people do better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No luck.</v>

1664
01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:16.153
<v Speaker 5>We can derive it from linguistic </v>
<v Speaker 5>analysis of verbal output now to some </v>

1665
01:31:18.771 --> 01:31:20.480
<v Speaker 5>degree.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that's still,</v>

1666
01:31:20.481 --> 01:31:21.890
<v Speaker 5>that's not a task,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

1667
01:31:22.010 --> 01:31:24.700
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So now we,</v>

1668
01:31:24.701 --> 01:31:25.534
<v Speaker 5>we produced a series of programs called </v>
<v Speaker 5>the self authoring suite and one of </v>

1669
01:31:28.821 --> 01:31:29.654
<v Speaker 5>them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the future authoring program to writing </v>

1670
01:31:31.341 --> 01:31:36.140
<v Speaker 5>program that helps people lay out their </v>
<v Speaker 5>plans for the future in,</v>

1671
01:31:36.141 --> 01:31:38.330
<v Speaker 5>in detail.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they have to consider their,</v>

1672
01:31:38.331 --> 01:31:41.930
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their intimate relationships,</v>

1673
01:31:41.931 --> 01:31:44.000
<v Speaker 5>their career goals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their educational goals,</v>

1674
01:31:44.001 --> 01:31:44.834
<v Speaker 5>their use of time outside work,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their plans to maintain mental and </v>

1675
01:31:47.181 --> 01:31:49.670
<v Speaker 5>physical health,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their use of drugs and alcohol.</v>

1676
01:31:49.820 --> 01:31:53.570
<v Speaker 5>They have to write for 15 minutes about </v>
<v Speaker 5>what kind of life they'd like to have if</v>

1677
01:31:53.571 --> 01:31:56.870
<v Speaker 5>they were taking care of themselves </v>
<v Speaker 5>three to five years in the future.</v>

1678
01:31:57.170 --> 01:31:59.060
<v Speaker 5>And then to write for the same amount of</v>
<v Speaker 5>time,</v>

1679
01:31:59.320 --> 01:32:03.070
<v Speaker 5>how terrible their life could be if all </v>
<v Speaker 5>their bad habits took control.</v>

1680
01:32:03.630 --> 01:32:07.060
<v Speaker 5>And then they have to turn the positive </v>
<v Speaker 5>vision into an implementable plan.</v>

1681
01:32:07.430 --> 01:32:11.860
<v Speaker 5>And we've managed to improve their </v>
<v Speaker 5>college grades by about 20% and drop out</v>

1682
01:32:11.861 --> 01:32:12.370
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>drop,</v>

1683
01:32:12.370 --> 01:32:17.200
<v Speaker 5>drop their dropout rate by about 25% </v>
<v Speaker 5>over about 10,000 students now.</v>

1684
01:32:17.530 --> 01:32:18.363
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we tried to see if that was mediated by </v>

1685
01:32:20.261 --> 01:32:23.320
<v Speaker 5>an improvement and conscientiousness and</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was no evidence for that.</v>

1686
01:32:23.950 --> 01:32:28.950
<v Speaker 5>What it was mediated by was number of </v>
<v Speaker 5>words written during the exercise.</v>

1687
01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:32.740
<v Speaker 5>So it turns out that thinking more about</v>
<v Speaker 5>your future helps,</v>

1688
01:32:32.890 --> 01:32:34.600
<v Speaker 5>the more you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the more it helps.</v>

1689
01:32:34.750 --> 01:32:36.120
<v Speaker 5>And maybe that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1690
01:32:36.130 --> 01:32:36.963
<v Speaker 5>maybe that would translate into an </v>
<v Speaker 5>improvement in conscientiousness across </v>

1691
01:32:39.251 --> 01:32:40.084
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

1692
01:32:40.370 --> 01:32:41.203
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there haven't been any credible studies </v>

1693
01:32:43.511 --> 01:32:44.344
<v Speaker 5>that I know of indicating that there are</v>
<v Speaker 5>exercises that can be done to improve </v>

1694
01:32:48.760 --> 01:32:50.500
<v Speaker 5>conscientiousness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's also,</v>

1695
01:32:50.950 --> 01:32:51.783
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>troublesome and worrisome because that </v>

1696
01:32:53.741 --> 01:32:55.300
<v Speaker 5>would be a nice thing to be able to do.</v>

1697
01:32:55.620 --> 01:32:58.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I haven't thought much about it.</v>

1698
01:32:58.991 --> 01:32:59.824
<v Speaker 4>They don't know much about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>literature on conscientiousness as a </v>

1699
01:33:01.771 --> 01:33:02.604
<v Speaker 4>trait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the word seems to connote to me as </v>

1700
01:33:05.221 --> 01:33:09.060
<v Speaker 4>an ordinary English speaker has a strong</v>
<v Speaker 4>social element to it as well.</v>

1701
01:33:09.061 --> 01:33:09.894
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of like a conscientious person</v>
<v Speaker 4>is somebody who doesn't forget his </v>

1702
01:33:12.901 --> 01:33:14.290
<v Speaker 4>obligations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1703
01:33:14.610 --> 01:33:18.210
<v Speaker 4>your index of conscientiousness and a </v>
<v Speaker 4>university professor is,</v>

1704
01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:19.393
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody has asked you to write them a </v>

1705
01:33:21.241 --> 01:33:24.120
<v Speaker 4>reference letter for getting into </v>
<v Speaker 4>graduate school or whatever.</v>

1706
01:33:24.290 --> 01:33:26.480
<v Speaker 4>Do you actually prioritize getting the </v>
<v Speaker 4>DAB thing done?</v>

1707
01:33:26.481 --> 01:33:29.520
<v Speaker 4>I'd Tibor is there some risks that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll just forget about it and shove it</v>

1708
01:33:29.521 --> 01:33:33.240
<v Speaker 4>to them somewhere else?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I imagine cut,</v>

1709
01:33:33.241 --> 01:33:34.074
<v Speaker 4>she had just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is having a strong element of </v>

1710
01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:36.833
<v Speaker 4>attentiveness to social obligation and </v>
<v Speaker 4>to the wellbeing of others as it is </v>

1711
01:33:41.281 --> 01:33:43.920
<v Speaker 4>defined and the personality of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>literature doesn't have any of that.</v>

1712
01:33:44.020 --> 01:33:44.580
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would,</v>

1713
01:33:44.580 --> 01:33:45.413
<v Speaker 5>I would say not so much attention to the</v>
<v Speaker 5>wellbeing of others because that's more </v>

1714
01:33:47.981 --> 01:33:50.800
<v Speaker 5>trait agreeableness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's more than maternal dimension.</v>

1715
01:33:50.801 --> 01:33:54.970
<v Speaker 5>But there's definitely a massive effect </v>
<v Speaker 5>of social obligation,</v>

1716
01:33:55.270 --> 01:33:56.103
<v Speaker 5>which is part of the reason why </v>
<v Speaker 5>conservatives tend to be hired </v>

1717
01:33:58.721 --> 01:34:02.260
<v Speaker 5>conscientiousness than liberals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's not well being of others.</v>

1718
01:34:02.261 --> 01:34:05.370
<v Speaker 5>It's duty.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so the,</v>

1719
01:34:05.371 --> 01:34:06.204
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the conscientious types may form and </v>

1720
01:34:08.321 --> 01:34:11.010
<v Speaker 5>maintain social contracts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

1721
01:34:11.290 --> 01:34:12.123
<v Speaker 5>they implement their plans and they seem</v>
<v Speaker 5>to feel shame and self contempt when </v>

1722
01:34:17.561 --> 01:34:18.394
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when they fail to live up to their </v>

1723
01:34:19.721 --> 01:34:20.554
<v Speaker 5>social obligations.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so that's another thing that's </v>

1724
01:34:22.211 --> 01:34:23.044
<v Speaker 5>interesting about the income </v>
<v Speaker 5>redistribution idea because it's </v>

1725
01:34:25.541 --> 01:34:26.374
<v Speaker 5>conceivable to me that conscientious </v>
<v Speaker 5>people would hate that because </v>

1726
01:34:30.370 --> 01:34:32.710
<v Speaker 5>conscientious people do very badly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

1727
01:34:32.711 --> 01:34:33.370
<v Speaker 5>if they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1728
01:34:33.370 --> 01:34:36.160
<v Speaker 5>if they're laid off from work,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even if it's not their fault,</v>

1729
01:34:36.250 --> 01:34:39.010
<v Speaker 5>they still take themselves apart for </v>
<v Speaker 5>their failure.</v>

1730
01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:40.553
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so conscientious people in </v>

1731
01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:46.840
<v Speaker 5>particular seem to find inactivity </v>
<v Speaker 5>without productivity,</v>

1732
01:34:47.780 --> 01:34:50.830
<v Speaker 5>highly aversive and adverse,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if enough to really cause them,</v>

1733
01:34:50.890 --> 01:34:52.510
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>major health problems.</v>

1734
01:34:52.990 --> 01:34:54.500
<v Speaker 5>So well,</v>

1735
01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:55.833
<v Speaker 4>could,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that brings us back to what we were </v>

1736
01:34:56.691 --> 01:34:58.970
<v Speaker 4>discussing a little while ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The problem of</v>

1737
01:35:02.410 --> 01:35:03.243
<v Speaker 4>ensuring that large numbers people have </v>
<v Speaker 4>access to bd goofball work in an age at </v>

1738
01:35:08.771 --> 01:35:11.050
<v Speaker 4>which it is more and more the case that </v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1739
01:35:11.170 --> 01:35:16.170
<v Speaker 4>that big components of the economy are </v>
<v Speaker 4>blue bag away with very few employees.</v>

1740
01:35:18.100 --> 01:35:21.850
<v Speaker 4>I that's going to continue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's probably going to escalate</v>

1741
01:35:23.580 --> 01:35:25.720
<v Speaker 4>or back to that same topic to some </v>
<v Speaker 4>extent.</v>

1742
01:35:25.740 --> 01:35:28.000
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But again,</v>

1743
01:35:28.001 --> 01:35:28.834
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I think,</v>

1744
01:35:29.260 --> 01:35:30.093
<v Speaker 4>I think any inequality of opportunity is</v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of they bought of our bedrock of </v>

1745
01:35:36.721 --> 01:35:38.170
<v Speaker 4>any quality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1746
01:35:38.420 --> 01:35:41.310
<v Speaker 4>Having its impact upon us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1747
01:35:41.340 --> 01:35:43.500
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's certainly the bond but bedrock of,</v>

1748
01:35:43.900 --> 01:35:47.800
<v Speaker 4>of why we should care about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Odd,</v>

1749
01:35:47.801 --> 01:35:50.620
<v Speaker 4>moral and social justice grouts it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1750
01:35:50.621 --> 01:35:53.410
<v Speaker 4>well why should people who,</v>

1751
01:35:54.800 --> 01:35:55.320
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1752
01:35:55.320 --> 01:36:00.010
<v Speaker 4>why should bloods birthright affect the </v>
<v Speaker 4>opportunity is available to what and</v>

1753
01:36:01.010 --> 01:36:01.843
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's also a social catastrophe because </v>

1754
01:36:03.770 --> 01:36:04.603
<v Speaker 5>hypothetically you want to set up a </v>
<v Speaker 5>society so that whatever someone has to </v>

1755
01:36:08.691 --> 01:36:09.524
<v Speaker 5>offer is maximally offerable to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>community because otherwise the </v>

1756
01:36:13.341 --> 01:36:15.110
<v Speaker 5>community loses.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1757
01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:15.951
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it seems to be,</v>

1758
01:36:15.951 --> 01:36:16.784
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think one of the great examples of </v>

1759
01:36:18.081 --> 01:36:19.880
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>although I don't think this accounts for</v>

1760
01:36:19.881 --> 01:36:20.714
<v Speaker 5>all of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that the relationship between the </v>

1761
01:36:22.311 --> 01:36:23.144
<v Speaker 5>provision of women's rights by countries</v>
<v Speaker 5>and their economic productivity is </v>

1762
01:36:26.031 --> 01:36:26.864
<v Speaker 5>staggeringly high.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I think that also has to do with o </v>

1763
01:36:30.290 --> 01:36:34.550
<v Speaker 5>openness in general to transformation </v>
<v Speaker 5>and change with,</v>

1764
01:36:34.610 --> 01:36:35.443
<v Speaker 5>with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with the provision of women's rights </v>

1765
01:36:36.621 --> 01:36:38.750
<v Speaker 5>being an index of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But nonetheless,</v>

1766
01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:41.870
<v Speaker 5>it's a great predictor of eventual </v>
<v Speaker 5>economic success.</v>

1767
01:36:42.170 --> 01:36:43.020
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so our park,</v>

1768
01:36:43.110 --> 01:36:43.943
<v Speaker 4>we get a ducks and partly perhaps bar </v>
<v Speaker 4>more direct effect that after all it </v>

1769
01:36:47.500 --> 01:36:50.140
<v Speaker 4>slightly over half the population,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1770
01:36:50.590 --> 01:36:54.220
<v Speaker 4>maybe their talents are better utilized.</v>

1771
01:36:55.700 --> 01:36:56.533
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well that's certainly what we would </v>

1772
01:36:57.311 --> 01:36:58.480
<v Speaker 5>hope.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think,</v>

1773
01:36:58.690 --> 01:36:59.523
<v Speaker 5>I think as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the evidence at least suggests </v>

1774
01:37:01.481 --> 01:37:02.350
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1775
01:37:02.410 --> 01:37:02.861
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1776
01:37:02.861 --> 01:37:06.790
<v Speaker 5>so let me recapitulate because we should</v>
<v Speaker 5>probably fold this up.</v>

1777
01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:11.350
<v Speaker 5>It's so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so as far as I'm concerned,</v>

1778
01:37:11.351 --> 01:37:12.184
<v Speaker 5>your work was revolutionary because it </v>
<v Speaker 5>undermined the general proposition that </v>

1779
01:37:16.151 --> 01:37:20.410
<v Speaker 5>the fundamental cause of crime and </v>
<v Speaker 5>violent crime in particular was poverty.</v>

1780
01:37:20.950 --> 01:37:22.840
<v Speaker 5>Instead you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you flipped it,</v>

1781
01:37:23.070 --> 01:37:24.910
<v Speaker 5>you flipped it on edge,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so to speak.</v>

1782
01:37:24.911 --> 01:37:28.540
<v Speaker 5>And made the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>made the claim well substantiated by the</v>

1783
01:37:28.541 --> 01:37:29.374
<v Speaker 5>research that it's relative poverty that</v>
<v Speaker 5>drives violent crime because of status </v>

1784
01:37:34.661 --> 01:37:38.600
<v Speaker 5>seeking primarily among young men and </v>
<v Speaker 5>older.</v>

1785
01:37:38.620 --> 01:37:42.760
<v Speaker 5>There are effects of absolute privation </v>
<v Speaker 5>and that would be the poverty.</v>

1786
01:37:42.761 --> 01:37:43.594
<v Speaker 5>It's the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the effects of relative deprivation of </v>

1787
01:37:47.081 --> 01:37:49.720
<v Speaker 5>status are much more,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say,</v>

1788
01:37:50.050 --> 01:37:52.930
<v Speaker 5>especially in our societies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>much more socially significant.</v>

1789
01:37:53.320 --> 01:37:54.153
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And up the status competition is driven </v>

1790
01:37:55.861 --> 01:38:00.210
<v Speaker 5>at least in part by the desire of men to</v>
<v Speaker 5>attain status,</v>

1791
01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:04.320
<v Speaker 5>to obtain access to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to women roughly speaking.</v>

1792
01:38:04.350 --> 01:38:05.183
<v Speaker 5>And it's partly because women outsourced</v>
<v Speaker 5>the problem of mate selection to the </v>

1793
01:38:09.031 --> 01:38:10.950
<v Speaker 5>male competition domain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1794
01:38:10.980 --> 01:38:13.230
<v Speaker 5>So the males compete,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the women peel off the top.</v>

1795
01:38:13.380 --> 01:38:15.450
<v Speaker 5>It's like a market solution in some </v>
<v Speaker 5>sense.</v>

1796
01:38:16.540 --> 01:38:17.373
<v Speaker 5>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then having pointed out that </v>

1797
01:38:20.250 --> 01:38:25.230
<v Speaker 5>inequality not only drives male homicide</v>
<v Speaker 5>but also tends to destabilize societies.</v>

1798
01:38:25.770 --> 01:38:30.770
<v Speaker 5>There is an impetus for people to </v>
<v Speaker 5>consider how we can stop the winner from</v>

1799
01:38:31.141 --> 01:38:35.160
<v Speaker 5>taking all without becoming unduly or </v>
<v Speaker 5>authoritarian about it or,</v>

1800
01:38:35.340 --> 01:38:38.580
<v Speaker 5>or,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or impeding individual productivity.</v>

1801
01:38:38.700 --> 01:38:42.170
<v Speaker 5>Given the fact that there is individual </v>
<v Speaker 5>variation in yes,</v>

1802
01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:45.090
<v Speaker 5>in the elements that actually produce </v>
<v Speaker 5>productivity.</v>

1803
01:38:45.091 --> 01:38:49.380
<v Speaker 5>That's our set of social problems,</v>
<v Speaker 5>exacerbated by the fact that we're going</v>

1804
01:38:49.381 --> 01:38:51.870
<v Speaker 5>to be wiping out employment for huge </v>
<v Speaker 5>categories,</v>

1805
01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:55.740
<v Speaker 5>particularly of men over the next 15 </v>
<v Speaker 5>years.</v>

1806
01:38:55.880 --> 01:38:57.080
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let me,</v>

1807
01:38:57.081 --> 01:38:58.580
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in this context,</v>

1808
01:38:59.090 --> 01:38:59.923
<v Speaker 4>just make a point that I spent most of a</v>
<v Speaker 4>chapter of my book on and that is that </v>

1809
01:39:04.430 --> 01:39:08.190
<v Speaker 4>the notion that inequality is somehow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1810
01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:09.193
<v Speaker 4>the engine of productivity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's been pretty much rejected by </v>

1811
01:39:13.820 --> 01:39:14.653
<v Speaker 4>economists themselves in recent years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've come to the conclusion that </v>

1812
01:39:17.660 --> 01:39:18.493
<v Speaker 4>relatively equitable places actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>have more of economic productivity in </v>

1813
01:39:23.871 --> 01:39:26.690
<v Speaker 4>the ensuing period of time than those </v>
<v Speaker 4>that start out boring,</v>

1814
01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:29.000
<v Speaker 4>inequitable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's a lot of reasons for that.</v>

1815
01:39:29.340 --> 01:39:31.350
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the one that I think is most striking to</v>

1816
01:39:31.351 --> 01:39:36.351
<v Speaker 4>you that I would commend people to look </v>
<v Speaker 4>into is the concept of useless,</v>

1817
01:39:36.891 --> 01:39:37.724
<v Speaker 4>if you like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are wasteful expenditure on guard wave </v>

1818
01:39:39.711 --> 01:39:40.544
<v Speaker 4>or relatively on equal societies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A guard waiver is a term coined by </v>

1819
01:39:44.010 --> 01:39:44.843
<v Speaker 4>economists samples and Arjun Jayadev.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what they've shown is that the </v>

1820
01:39:49.041 --> 01:39:53.090
<v Speaker 4>number of people who are employed just </v>
<v Speaker 4>jobs like being security guards,</v>

1821
01:39:53.380 --> 01:39:55.400
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>goes up as it equality goes up.</v>

1822
01:39:55.401 --> 01:39:57.290
<v Speaker 4>It's no great surprise when you think </v>
<v Speaker 4>about it,</v>

1823
01:39:57.590 --> 01:40:00.920
<v Speaker 4>but you could defy guard labor bar </v>
<v Speaker 4>broadly or more narrowly.</v>

1824
01:40:00.921 --> 01:40:05.540
<v Speaker 4>And the general result is that a large </v>
<v Speaker 4>proportion of people are engaged at work</v>

1825
01:40:05.541 --> 01:40:06.374
<v Speaker 4>then is it a sense nod productive?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just trying to prevent people from </v>

1826
01:40:08.841 --> 01:40:09.674
<v Speaker 4>usurping the property of other people </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that this is a very wasteful </v>

1827
01:40:14.331 --> 01:40:15.164
<v Speaker 4>consequences of extreme inequality and </v>
<v Speaker 4>economic waste that's reduced to </v>

1828
01:40:19.341 --> 01:40:22.370
<v Speaker 4>relatively equitable societies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there are others.</v>

1829
01:40:23.740 --> 01:40:24.573
<v Speaker 4>As the</v>

1830
01:40:24.720 --> 01:40:25.553
<v Speaker 5>society becomes more unequal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it tilts towards authoritarianism at </v>

1831
01:40:29.130 --> 01:40:29.970
<v Speaker 5>multiple levels.</v>

1832
01:40:30.220 --> 01:40:32.380
<v Speaker 4>Organization,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's one that just,</v>

1833
01:40:33.130 --> 01:40:33.963
<v Speaker 4>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was just going to say add towards </v>

1834
01:40:35.020 --> 01:40:38.350
<v Speaker 4>exactly this and it's counterproductive </v>
<v Speaker 4>even from the point of view of,</v>

1835
01:40:38.351 --> 01:40:40.540
<v Speaker 4>of simple,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1836
01:40:40.541 --> 01:40:42.580
<v Speaker 4>economic criteria,</v>
<v Speaker 4>GDP,</v>

1837
01:40:42.581 --> 01:40:44.170
<v Speaker 4>it so odd that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1838
01:40:44.530 --> 01:40:45.363
<v Speaker 4>that inequality gets in the way that for</v>
<v Speaker 4>a bunch of reasons and other really </v>

1839
01:40:48.191 --> 01:40:50.770
<v Speaker 4>interesting when the ball's has,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1840
01:40:51.340 --> 01:40:56.340
<v Speaker 4>has articulated it in a book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Paul's b o w l e s sat bowls to people I</v>

1841
01:40:56.641 --> 01:40:57.950
<v Speaker 4>don't look about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1842
01:40:58.390 --> 01:40:59.223
<v Speaker 4>I think that's book was called the new </v>
<v Speaker 4>politics of any quality of </v>

1843
01:41:02.651 --> 01:41:04.420
<v Speaker 4>redistribution to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I liked it a lot.</v>

1844
01:41:05.380 --> 01:41:07.600
<v Speaker 4>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One thing that he's shown that I thought</v>

1845
01:41:07.601 --> 01:41:08.434
<v Speaker 4>was very interesting and it never </v>
<v Speaker 4>entered my head before I read was that </v>

1846
01:41:12.010 --> 01:41:17.010
<v Speaker 4>the actual quality of goods it is </v>
<v Speaker 4>society can be damaged by severity,</v>

1847
01:41:17.051 --> 01:41:18.310
<v Speaker 4>quality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When</v>

1848
01:41:20.050 --> 01:41:20.883
<v Speaker 4>rich individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which firms have the capacity to keep </v>

1849
01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:29.520
<v Speaker 4>innovators and small companies from </v>
<v Speaker 4>establishing themselves.</v>

1850
01:41:29.531 --> 01:41:30.364
<v Speaker 4>You mentioned before about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>differences and entrepreneurial </v>

1851
01:41:33.040 --> 01:41:33.873
<v Speaker 4>undertakings and where large numbers of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people with worthy small business plans </v>

1852
01:41:39.251 --> 01:41:42.130
<v Speaker 4>can't capitalize them properly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It can't get off the ground.</v>

1853
01:41:42.131 --> 01:41:42.964
<v Speaker 4>You've actually got a phenomenon of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people with lots of wealth and shoddy </v>

1854
01:41:47.471 --> 01:41:48.304
<v Speaker 4>products can drive people with better </v>
<v Speaker 4>quality products who are trying to get </v>

1855
01:41:51.311 --> 01:41:52.144
<v Speaker 4>started at the bottom out of the bar </v>
<v Speaker 4>camp with negative results for just the </v>

1856
01:41:56.351 --> 01:41:57.184
<v Speaker 4>consumer.</v>

1857
01:41:57.510 --> 01:41:58.343
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the society having people stack up at </v>

1858
01:41:59.941 --> 01:42:00.774
<v Speaker 5>zero zero turns out to be a very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very difficult place to get out of </v>

1859
01:42:04.130 --> 01:42:06.420
<v Speaker 5>because you can't leverage yourself out </v>
<v Speaker 5>of it.</v>

1860
01:42:06.790 --> 01:42:07.623
<v Speaker 5>And what's also in those really unequal </v>
<v Speaker 5>societies to like say Central American </v>

1861
01:42:10.801 --> 01:42:11.634
<v Speaker 5>societies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's also becomes increasingly </v>

1862
01:42:13.261 --> 01:42:14.094
<v Speaker 5>unpleasant for the people who are </v>
<v Speaker 5>wealthy because they're only wealthy in </v>

1863
01:42:16.201 --> 01:42:20.010
<v Speaker 5>a very narrowly defined way because they</v>
<v Speaker 5>can't go outside.</v>

1864
01:42:20.130 --> 01:42:20.963
<v Speaker 5>They can't let their children go out on </v>
<v Speaker 5>into public because they'll get </v>

1865
01:42:23.761 --> 01:42:24.690
<v Speaker 5>kidnapped.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1866
01:42:24.870 --> 01:42:28.820
<v Speaker 5>the societies get pretty ugly when the </v>
<v Speaker 5>fences have to be really high and yes,</v>

1867
01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:30.210
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so,</v>

1868
01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:33.000
<v Speaker 5>so</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

1869
01:42:33.150 --> 01:42:35.860
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the rich countries,</v>

1870
01:42:36.550 --> 01:42:39.270
<v Speaker 4>rich countries of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those problems are not absent.</v>

1871
01:42:39.300 --> 01:42:40.133
<v Speaker 4>I mean there are certainly worse than </v>
<v Speaker 4>the u s than they are in Canada or most </v>

1872
01:42:42.571 --> 01:42:43.404
<v Speaker 4>of western Europe.</v>

1873
01:42:45.510 --> 01:42:47.050
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1874
01:42:47.051 --> 01:42:48.460
<v Speaker 5>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was really good.</v>

1875
01:42:48.750 --> 01:42:52.510
<v Speaker 5>I'm very happy that you agreed to do a </v>
<v Speaker 5>podcast with Ben and I mean,</v>

1876
01:42:52.540 --> 01:42:54.340
<v Speaker 5>I found your work well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

1877
01:42:54.490 --> 01:42:55.323
<v Speaker 5>I definitely regard you as one of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>people who's been highly influential on </v>

1878
01:42:59.081 --> 01:42:59.950
<v Speaker 5>my thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1879
01:42:59.951 --> 01:43:02.140
<v Speaker 5>I think that work on relative poverty is</v>
<v Speaker 5>just,</v>

1880
01:43:02.660 --> 01:43:05.560
<v Speaker 5>and the effect sizes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the work you guys did in Chicago,</v>

1881
01:43:06.130 --> 01:43:10.780
<v Speaker 5>your work on indicating the adaptive </v>
<v Speaker 5>utility of,</v>

1882
01:43:11.170 --> 01:43:14.070
<v Speaker 5>of uncertainty related dominous </v>
<v Speaker 5>challenges in,</v>

1883
01:43:14.071 --> 01:43:14.904
<v Speaker 5>in unequal societies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All of that's brilliant I think can </v>

1884
01:43:17.170 --> 01:43:18.003
<v Speaker 5>nicely biologically predicated in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>science has done extremely soundly and </v>

1885
01:43:21.251 --> 01:43:24.310
<v Speaker 5>it has remarkable policy implications </v>
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

1886
01:43:24.311 --> 01:43:27.610
<v Speaker 5>and it changes the view around crime </v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

1887
01:43:27.940 --> 01:43:28.773
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and wealth and in a very important way </v>

1888
01:43:30.671 --> 01:43:32.950
<v Speaker 5>to tilt it over towards the inequality </v>
<v Speaker 5>side.</v>

1889
01:43:32.951 --> 01:43:33.784
<v Speaker 5>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it fits so nicely in with the </v>

1890
01:43:35.591 --> 01:43:37.450
<v Speaker 5>dominance hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>literature and all of that.</v>

1891
01:43:37.451 --> 01:43:39.790
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's really profound stuff as far as I'm</v>

1892
01:43:39.791 --> 01:43:40.624
<v Speaker 5>concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I'm really glad you had a chance to </v>

1893
01:43:42.281 --> 01:43:43.330
<v Speaker 5>share it with everyone.</v>

1894
01:43:44.220 --> 01:43:47.250
<v Speaker 4>Thank you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I appreciate those kind words.</v>

1895
01:43:47.251 --> 01:43:49.950
<v Speaker 4>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>flattery will get you everywhere.</v>

1896
01:43:50.990 --> 01:43:52.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well the thing is,</v>

1897
01:43:52.190 --> 01:43:55.340
<v Speaker 5>the best kind of flattery is truth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

1898
01:43:55.490 --> 01:43:56.323
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would certainly recommend that people </v>

1899
01:43:58.071 --> 01:43:58.904
<v Speaker 5>take a look at your book if they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>interested in what we've been </v>

1900
01:44:00.801 --> 01:44:01.790
<v Speaker 5>discussing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>

1901
01:44:01.791 --> 01:44:04.070
<v Speaker 5>that's killing the competition,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is,</v>

1902
01:44:04.071 --> 01:44:05.690
<v Speaker 5>it's very readable,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would say.</v>

1903
01:44:05.691 --> 01:44:09.230
<v Speaker 5>It provides a lovely argument with </v>
<v Speaker 5>regards to inequality,</v>

1904
01:44:09.500 --> 01:44:13.050
<v Speaker 5>addresses the major criticisms,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think very effectively and,</v>

1905
01:44:13.051 --> 01:44:13.884
<v Speaker 5>and starts to lay out what is going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>be an increasingly necessary public </v>

1906
01:44:17.181 --> 01:44:20.840
<v Speaker 5>discussion about how civilized societies</v>
<v Speaker 5>can,</v>

1907
01:44:21.200 --> 01:44:24.500
<v Speaker 5>can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>can ensure that they don't collapse into</v>

1908
01:44:24.501 --> 01:44:27.450
<v Speaker 5>two extreme distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1909
01:44:27.820 --> 01:44:28.653
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>w into two extreme distributions of </v>

1910
01:44:31.011 --> 01:44:33.080
<v Speaker 5>wealth or other resources.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a real danger.</v>

1911
01:44:33.081 --> 01:44:34.370
<v Speaker 5>It's a conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 5>unconscious,</v>

1912
01:44:34.580 --> 01:44:35.413
<v Speaker 5>constant danger.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It needs to be thought through and </v>

1913
01:44:36.951 --> 01:44:40.450
<v Speaker 5>addressed very intelligently.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So thanks again.</v>

1914
01:44:40.490 --> 01:44:42.320
<v Speaker 5>Hopefully,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe we'll get another chance to talk,</v>

1915
01:44:42.321 --> 01:44:44.510
<v Speaker 5>hopefully a couple of hundred thousand </v>
<v Speaker 5>people to watch this.</v>

1916
01:44:44.511 --> 01:44:46.080
<v Speaker 5>That will be good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That'll okay.</v>

1917
01:44:46.081 --> 01:44:47.480
<v Speaker 5>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Thanks a lot.</v>

1918
01:44:47.690 --> 01:44:50.660
<v Speaker 5>You Bet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] signing off.</v>

1919
01:44:50.970 --> 01:44:51.803
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
