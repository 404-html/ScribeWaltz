1
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.490
<v Speaker 1>You know when the computer starts up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has to boot.</v>

2
00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.950
<v Speaker 1>Bootstrap is what that means at</v>
<v Speaker 1>bootstraps itself by continuing to</v>

3
00:00:41.051 --> 00:00:44.530
<v Speaker 1>engage in more and more complex</v>
<v Speaker 1>processes as it starts up,</v>

4
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.490
<v Speaker 1>so it starts up with a simple process</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that triggers a more complex process</v>

5
00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.690
<v Speaker 1>and that triggers a more complex process</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that way the computer boots itself</v>

6
00:00:52.691 --> 00:00:54.220
<v Speaker 1>into existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

7
00:00:54.221 --> 00:00:57.340
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what we did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except we did it over like 3 billion</v>

8
00:00:57.341 --> 00:00:57.971
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

9
00:00:57.971 --> 00:01:01.960
<v Speaker 1>We started out as these unbelievably</v>
<v Speaker 1>simple organisms that could pretty much</v>

10
00:01:01.961 --> 00:01:06.961
<v Speaker 1>do nothing at all except replicate and</v>
<v Speaker 1>develop much more and more complex forms</v>

11
00:01:08.381 --> 00:01:12.040
<v Speaker 1>over this tremendously long period of</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary history.</v>

12
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.740
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's how we solve the problem that</v>

13
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.730
<v Speaker 1>you can't know anything without knowing</v>
<v Speaker 1>something and that you can't have</v>

14
00:01:18.731 --> 00:01:21.490
<v Speaker 1>knowledge without generating it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a little knowledge,</v>

15
00:01:21.491 --> 00:01:23.170
<v Speaker 1>a little more generation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little knowledge,</v>

16
00:01:23.171 --> 00:01:24.820
<v Speaker 1>a little more generational little</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge.</v>

17
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.070
<v Speaker 1>This huge spiraling cross as an expense</v>
<v Speaker 1>extends over vast amounts of time,</v>

18
00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.340
<v Speaker 1>information encoded in your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

19
00:01:33.341 --> 00:01:36.460
<v Speaker 1>As part of your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as part of the nature of your being and</v>

20
00:01:36.461 --> 00:01:40.390
<v Speaker 1>information encoded in your culture</v>
<v Speaker 1>reflected inside you and acted out in</v>

21
00:01:40.391 --> 00:01:41.224
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>

22
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.940
<v Speaker 1>and as scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

23
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.120
<v Speaker 1>with this 500 year history of science</v>
<v Speaker 1>behind us,</v>

24
00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.750
<v Speaker 1>we always believed that it's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>material substrate of things.</v>

25
00:01:55.751 --> 00:01:59.920
<v Speaker 1>That's the reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is more complicated than that</v>

26
00:01:59.921 --> 00:02:04.420
<v Speaker 1>because even the material substrate that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we consider us scientists isn't merely</v>

27
00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.910
<v Speaker 1>unformed stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

28
00:02:06.911 --> 00:02:09.160
<v Speaker 1>It has structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's patterned,</v>

29
00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.450
<v Speaker 1>it's full of information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there are physicists working now who</v>

30
00:02:13.451 --> 00:02:18.130
<v Speaker 1>believed that conceptualization of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ground of being the material grounded of</v>

31
00:02:18.131 --> 00:02:23.131
<v Speaker 1>being as the information is a more</v>
<v Speaker 1>fruitful metaphor than conceptualization</v>

32
00:02:23.471 --> 00:02:26.020
<v Speaker 1>of the ground of being as like unformed</v>
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>

33
00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.700
<v Speaker 1>It's not unformed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

34
00:02:27.701 --> 00:02:32.701
<v Speaker 1>It's pattern and regular informative so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you investigated it reveals</v>

35
00:02:32.921 --> 00:02:35.590
<v Speaker 1>order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not just a material structure.</v>

36
00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.600
<v Speaker 1>So if you go back to Democritus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

37
00:02:37.601 --> 00:02:40.480
<v Speaker 1>The person who originated the atomic</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis,</v>

38
00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.300
<v Speaker 1>democritus actually says two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not One.</v>

39
00:02:43.301 --> 00:02:46.780
<v Speaker 1>He says everything's made out of atoms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Little bits of stuff,</v>

40
00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.700
<v Speaker 1>but the other thing he says is Adam's</v>
<v Speaker 1>array themselves in space array</v>

41
00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.700
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what that means is that the atomic</v>

42
00:02:54.701 --> 00:02:58.750
<v Speaker 1>structure of things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his pattern and the pattern is just as</v>

43
00:02:58.751 --> 00:03:00.460
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The atoms themselves,</v>

44
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.260
<v Speaker 1>it's the pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the knowledge,</v>

45
00:03:02.261 --> 00:03:03.011
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A pattern.</v>

46
00:03:03.011 --> 00:03:03.970
<v Speaker 1>That's the information.</v>

47
00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.440
<v Speaker 1>So while we encounter as conscious</v>
<v Speaker 1>beings is this complex sleep pattern to</v>

48
00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.060
<v Speaker 1>ray,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we then turned into knowledge,</v>

49
00:03:17.061 --> 00:03:19.190
<v Speaker 1>usable knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

50
00:03:19.191 --> 00:03:21.410
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would this metaphorical</v>

51
00:03:21.411 --> 00:03:24.140
<v Speaker 1>representation work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the way I want you to look at</v>

52
00:03:24.141 --> 00:03:27.470
<v Speaker 1>this figure is like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine this as distant,</v>

53
00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.550
<v Speaker 1>right as lurking in the background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is the ground of all being</v>

54
00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.570
<v Speaker 1>manifesting itself as one primordial</v>
<v Speaker 1>archetype or one,</v>

55
00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.410
<v Speaker 1>one metaphor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one standard mode of metaphorical</v>

56
00:03:39.411 --> 00:03:42.800
<v Speaker 1>representation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why this figure?</v>

57
00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.660
<v Speaker 1>While this is complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

58
00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.280
<v Speaker 1>if you show men picture of a beautiful</v>
<v Speaker 1>woman with her eyes avert while you're</v>

59
00:03:52.791 --> 00:03:55.340
<v Speaker 1>doing a brain scan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mapping of their nucleus,</v>

60
00:03:55.341 --> 00:03:57.740
<v Speaker 1>accumbent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing happens.</v>

61
00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.770
<v Speaker 1>Why is that relevant?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

62
00:04:00.771 --> 00:04:04.190
<v Speaker 1>the nucleus accumbens is part of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>underlying emotional circuitry that</v>

63
00:04:04.191 --> 00:04:08.630
<v Speaker 1>governs approach behavior and pleasure</v>
<v Speaker 1>and approach behavior and pleasure very</v>

64
00:04:08.631 --> 00:04:11.840
<v Speaker 1>tightly intertwined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you show the same picture of a</v>

65
00:04:11.841 --> 00:04:16.550
<v Speaker 1>beautiful woman with her eyes locked on</v>
<v Speaker 1>his is nucleus accumbens will light up.</v>

66
00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.250
<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

67
00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.810
<v Speaker 1>it's partly because men are innately</v>
<v Speaker 1>attuned to who to female beauty.</v>

68
00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.350
<v Speaker 1>Female beauty has a standard form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's replicable cross culturally,</v>

69
00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.330
<v Speaker 1>it constitutes the average human human</v>
<v Speaker 1>female form,</v>

70
00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.380
<v Speaker 1>but more than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gays locking is an indication of</v>

71
00:04:36.381 --> 00:04:40.340
<v Speaker 1>shared attention and it's also the</v>
<v Speaker 1>indication of the initial establishment</v>

72
00:04:40.341 --> 00:04:44.480
<v Speaker 1>of a shared attentional space and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>an invitation and that invitation</v>

73
00:04:44.481 --> 00:04:47.510
<v Speaker 1>activates approach circuits really even</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's just a picture.</v>

74
00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.690
<v Speaker 1>So when you can see this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you walk into any drugstore or any,</v>

75
00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.360
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any drug store that sells magazines,</v>

76
00:04:53.361 --> 00:04:57.800
<v Speaker 1>what do you see on the men's magazines?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see an infinite array of beautiful</v>

77
00:04:57.801 --> 00:05:00.860
<v Speaker 1>women and in the female magazines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the women's magazines,</v>

78
00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.590
<v Speaker 1>you see an infinite array of beautiful</v>
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>

79
00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.500
<v Speaker 1>Now just exactly why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

80
00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.260
<v Speaker 1>there's something absolutely compelling</v>
<v Speaker 1>about female beauty,</v>

81
00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:13.280
<v Speaker 1>and then you have to ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell does compelling mean?</v>

82
00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:17.210
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what compelling means is you're</v>

83
00:05:17.211 --> 00:05:22.211
<v Speaker 1>busily engaged in a goal directed task</v>
<v Speaker 1>and something happens in your peripheral</v>

84
00:05:22.611 --> 00:05:23.990
<v Speaker 1>vision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

85
00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:27.620
<v Speaker 1>that attracts your attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that attention is attracted by</v>

86
00:05:27.621 --> 00:05:29.960
<v Speaker 1>processes that are fundamentally</v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious,</v>

87
00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:35.260
<v Speaker 1>which means processes that occur before</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can think so you can imagine a loose</v>

88
00:05:37.131 --> 00:05:42.131
<v Speaker 1>collection of college age males having a</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation in a bar when someone</v>

89
00:05:43.791 --> 00:05:48.791
<v Speaker 1>beautiful walks by and one or more of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them capture out of the corner of their</v>

90
00:05:49.131 --> 00:05:51.320
<v Speaker 1>eyes orientation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

91
00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.300
<v Speaker 1>Unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

92
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:57.560
<v Speaker 1>Because there's something about that</v>
<v Speaker 1>pattern form that grips attentional</v>

93
00:05:57.561 --> 00:06:00.530
<v Speaker 1>systems and direct observation towards</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

94
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:06.650
<v Speaker 1>So then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

95
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.940
<v Speaker 1>human beings are really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really complicated pattern processes and</v>

96
00:06:10.941 --> 00:06:11.774
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

97
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.470
<v Speaker 1>partly what we're trying to get a handle</v>
<v Speaker 1>on here is the nature of the world and</v>

98
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.920
<v Speaker 1>partly what we know already is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are aspects of the world that you</v>

99
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:22.100
<v Speaker 1>can't understand always and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

100
00:06:22.101 --> 00:06:24.710
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are trying to get a grip on the</v>

101
00:06:24.711 --> 00:06:28.010
<v Speaker 1>fact that there are parts of the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can understand so that there's</v>

102
00:06:28.011 --> 00:06:32.510
<v Speaker 1>this transcendent element to being that</v>
<v Speaker 1>always escapes encapsulation.</v>

103
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:35.180
<v Speaker 1>How would you represent it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

104
00:06:35.181 --> 00:06:39.080
<v Speaker 1>it's the transcendent element of things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that always attracts your attention</v>

105
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:44.590
<v Speaker 1>implicitly beyond your control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so allow noise or a scream or the cry of</v>

106
00:06:44.931 --> 00:06:49.310
<v Speaker 1>a baby or anything horrific,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

107
00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:51.890
<v Speaker 1>Blood broken bodies.</v>

108
00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:59.260
<v Speaker 1>These are stimuli that are so</v>
<v Speaker 1>representative of trouble that you can't</v>

109
00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:04.630
<v Speaker 1>help but attend to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you can imagine that all of the</v>

110
00:07:05.261 --> 00:07:07.010
<v Speaker 1>stimuli,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

111
00:07:07.011 --> 00:07:11.090
<v Speaker 1>that you can't help but attend to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be a male dominated into</v>

112
00:07:11.091 --> 00:07:16.091
<v Speaker 1>representations of the transcendent</v>
<v Speaker 1>aspect of reality,</v>

113
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:19.790
<v Speaker 1>and that's what you see in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>representation right here.</v>

114
00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:25.090
<v Speaker 1>So you see a weird intermingling of</v>
<v Speaker 1>female sexuality plus some very distinct</v>

115
00:07:28.581 --> 00:07:32.600
<v Speaker 1>genital symbolism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why genital so imagine that that's a</v>

116
00:07:32.601 --> 00:07:34.730
<v Speaker 1>Volvo opening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why</v>

117
00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:41.000
<v Speaker 1>before we had any scientific knowledge</v>
<v Speaker 1>at all at school 10,000 years ago,</v>

118
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:44.900
<v Speaker 1>what the hell is inside a body?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While we knew that,</v>

119
00:07:44.901 --> 00:07:46.430
<v Speaker 1>I guess a little bit from hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

120
00:07:46.431 --> 00:07:49.910
<v Speaker 1>We knew the interior of a body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it about the interior of a body</v>

121
00:07:49.911 --> 00:07:53.960
<v Speaker 1>that allows new forms to be generated?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How is it that mothers can give birth to</v>

122
00:07:53.961 --> 00:07:54.620
<v Speaker 1>children?</v>

123
00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:59.000
<v Speaker 1>How is it that one form that's complex</v>
<v Speaker 1>and attractive and mysterious can give</v>

124
00:07:59.001 --> 00:08:03.170
<v Speaker 1>rise to another form?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is that useful knowledge from a</v>

125
00:08:03.171 --> 00:08:07.070
<v Speaker 1>representational perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's some association between</v>

126
00:08:07.071 --> 00:08:10.520
<v Speaker 1>the Feminine Form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a metaphorical perspective and the</v>

127
00:08:10.521 --> 00:08:14.000
<v Speaker 1>capacity for nature to give rise to new</v>
<v Speaker 1>forms</v>

128
00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:20.240
<v Speaker 1>and then you see a representation of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>typical monstrous form that's Kelly,</v>

129
00:08:20.241 --> 00:08:25.241
<v Speaker 1>the Hindu goddess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the devour and in this representation.</v>

130
00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:29.820
<v Speaker 1>So she's like a more developed version</v>
<v Speaker 1>of tie a mat.</v>

131
00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:34.790
<v Speaker 1>That's a good way of thinking about her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's not so much unspeakable anymore.</v>

132
00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:37.760
<v Speaker 1>You could actually say a few things</v>
<v Speaker 1>about Kelly.</v>

133
00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:39.230
<v Speaker 1>You could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

134
00:08:39.231 --> 00:08:43.040
<v Speaker 1>she's like a spider because she has</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight legs and she weaves a web of fate</v>

135
00:08:43.041 --> 00:08:43.821
<v Speaker 1>and you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

136
00:08:43.821 --> 00:08:47.060
<v Speaker 1>her web is made out of fire because if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get too near to her,</v>

137
00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:51.170
<v Speaker 1>you'll burn up and you could say she</v>
<v Speaker 1>glares at you with eyes that are</v>

138
00:08:51.171 --> 00:08:54.770
<v Speaker 1>unblinking and you could say she has a</v>
<v Speaker 1>tongue like a tiger,</v>

139
00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:59.800
<v Speaker 1>and you could say that she carries</v>
<v Speaker 1>weapons of destruction and it has a head</v>

140
00:08:59.801 --> 00:09:02.100
<v Speaker 1>dress of skulls and that her hair is on</v>
<v Speaker 1>fire.</v>

141
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:06.840
<v Speaker 1>And you could say that she's giving</v>
<v Speaker 1>birth to this guy as nature gives birth</v>

142
00:09:06.841 --> 00:09:10.080
<v Speaker 1>to human beings and is devouring him at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same time,</v>

143
00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:13.830
<v Speaker 1>intestines first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you could say,</v>

144
00:09:13.831 --> 00:09:16.620
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could imagine that the first few</v>

145
00:09:16.621 --> 00:09:21.621
<v Speaker 1>people that made a representation like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that shock themselves quite badly.</v>

146
00:09:23.521 --> 00:09:24.630
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because this is a.</v>

147
00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:28.800
<v Speaker 1>This is a representation of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of fear itself in a sense,</v>

148
00:09:28.801 --> 00:09:31.650
<v Speaker 1>but not exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also a representation of those</v>

149
00:09:31.651 --> 00:09:36.651
<v Speaker 1>stimuli that if you're human are going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make you both afraid and compelled</v>

150
00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:40.200
<v Speaker 1>just like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to look away from fire even if</v>

151
00:09:40.201 --> 00:09:43.290
<v Speaker 1>it's burning something down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you wanted to have around</v>

152
00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:51.480
<v Speaker 1>rats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you raise a route to juvenile status</v>

153
00:09:51.481 --> 00:09:56.481
<v Speaker 1>and then washed and cat odor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will completely short circuit why?</v>

154
00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:00.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rats never seen a cat.</v>

155
00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:03.150
<v Speaker 1>So exactly what the hell is it</v>
<v Speaker 1>responding to you think,</v>

156
00:10:03.151 --> 00:10:03.811
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can say,</v>

157
00:10:03.811 --> 00:10:05.970
<v Speaker 1>well it's not a conditioned stimulus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

158
00:10:05.971 --> 00:10:07.680
<v Speaker 1>Because the routes never encountered a</v>
<v Speaker 1>cat.</v>

159
00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:12.900
<v Speaker 1>There's something deep in the brain of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that wrap that knows something about cat</v>

160
00:10:12.901 --> 00:10:17.370
<v Speaker 1>odor was never encountered a cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So exactly what is it perceiving?</v>

161
00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:19.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense,</v>

162
00:10:19.111 --> 00:10:21.660
<v Speaker 1>I think the notion that it's perceiving</v>
<v Speaker 1>is wrong,</v>

163
00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:24.960
<v Speaker 1>it isn't perceiving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just going like this.</v>

164
00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:29.070
<v Speaker 1>That's the representation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While I'm with chimpanzees who are more</v>

165
00:10:29.071 --> 00:10:31.440
<v Speaker 1>complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are other stimuli that evoke</v>

166
00:10:31.441 --> 00:10:34.530
<v Speaker 1>exactly that kind of response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chimps don't like snakes,</v>

167
00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:36.270
<v Speaker 1>dander alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plastic,</v>

168
00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:39.270
<v Speaker 1>rubber doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't like snakes.</v>

169
00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.970
<v Speaker 1>If you put one in their case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get as far away from the snake as</v>

170
00:10:41.971 --> 00:10:45.240
<v Speaker 1>they can as quickly as possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they look at it because I</v>

171
00:10:45.241 --> 00:10:48.060
<v Speaker 1>suppose if you're a chimpanzee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you don't like snakes,</v>

172
00:10:48.061 --> 00:10:49.590
<v Speaker 1>it's a good idea to know where they are.</v>

173
00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:51.940
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's similar to repel,</v>

174
00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:55.470
<v Speaker 1>repelling snake plus attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

175
00:10:55.471 --> 00:10:57.600
<v Speaker 1>Well you better look at it and see where</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to go.</v>

176
00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:01.650
<v Speaker 1>Chimpanzees don't like unconscious</v>
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzees,</v>

177
00:11:01.651 --> 00:11:05.850
<v Speaker 1>so if you knock a chimpanzee out with</v>
<v Speaker 1>anesthetic and you bring the body of the</v>

178
00:11:05.851 --> 00:11:07.770
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzee back into the chimpanzee</v>
<v Speaker 1>cage,</v>

179
00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:10.650
<v Speaker 1>the chimps do exactly the same thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>away from the body,</v>

180
00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:14.460
<v Speaker 1>but they look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't like masks made of chimpanzee</v>

181
00:11:14.461 --> 00:11:17.640
<v Speaker 1>faces while three year old kids don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>like masks either.</v>

182
00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:21.030
<v Speaker 1>There are these underlying perceptual</v>
<v Speaker 1>primitive,</v>

183
00:11:21.031 --> 00:11:26.031
<v Speaker 1>so to speak that likely activate lower</v>
<v Speaker 1>limbic mechanisms in our brains that say</v>

184
00:11:26.791 --> 00:11:31.791
<v Speaker 1>to us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a place suddenly where something</v>

185
00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:36.330
<v Speaker 1>unexpected that you probably do not like</v>
<v Speaker 1>or will not like is very,</v>

186
00:11:36.331 --> 00:11:39.210
<v Speaker 1>very likely to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can imagine that an environment</v>

187
00:11:39.211 --> 00:11:44.211
<v Speaker 1>characterized by</v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious bodies or blood or the</v>

188
00:11:44.401 --> 00:11:46.950
<v Speaker 1>presence of spiders or snakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>

189
00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:50.730
<v Speaker 1>Might be a place where primates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>such as yourself may encounter things</v>

190
00:11:50.731 --> 00:11:53.680
<v Speaker 1>that they don't know how to cope with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Therefore afraid.</v>

191
00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:56.080
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>SaMe with fear of the dark,</v>

192
00:11:56.081 --> 00:12:00.520
<v Speaker 1>and then you could imagine that the dark</v>
<v Speaker 1>is populated with all of these monsters</v>

193
00:12:00.521 --> 00:12:03.820
<v Speaker 1>of the unknown and you get some notion</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what's happening to children who are</v>

194
00:12:03.821 --> 00:12:06.190
<v Speaker 1>afraid of the dark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are they afraid of the dark?</v>

195
00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:09.490
<v Speaker 1>because in the dark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the place you don't know,</v>

196
00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:13.090
<v Speaker 1>learned things that could hurt a</v>
<v Speaker 1>creature like you.</v>

197
00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:17.140
<v Speaker 1>What things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how we can't exactly say,</v>

198
00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:20.800
<v Speaker 1>but if you give children exposure to</v>
<v Speaker 1>books and to adult conversation and to</v>

199
00:12:20.801 --> 00:12:23.470
<v Speaker 1>television soon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those limbic structures that are</v>

200
00:12:23.471 --> 00:12:28.471
<v Speaker 1>populating the darkness with unnameable</v>
<v Speaker 1>fear start to populate it up with</v>

201
00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:33.580
<v Speaker 1>skeletons and vampires and monsters and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so forth and so on,</v>

202
00:12:33.581 --> 00:12:37.900
<v Speaker 1>has the representational structures that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the brain is capable of generating,</v>

203
00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:39.550
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

204
00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:42.700
<v Speaker 1>fear of inducing things are like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're bloody.</v>

205
00:12:42.701 --> 00:12:44.590
<v Speaker 1>They're dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They look like serpents.</v>

206
00:12:44.591 --> 00:12:46.900
<v Speaker 1>They look like insects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They lurk in the dark.</v>

207
00:12:46.901 --> 00:12:48.550
<v Speaker 1>They sneak up on you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera,</v>

208
00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:51.790
<v Speaker 1>all mangled together into some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>monsters form.</v>

209
00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:55.000
<v Speaker 1>Now I want to read you a story.</v>

210
00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:01.350
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let me give you a little background</v>

211
00:13:01.351 --> 00:13:04.950
<v Speaker 1>to this story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This story popped into my head in one</v>

212
00:13:04.951 --> 00:13:08.310
<v Speaker 1>chunk like complete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I thought was kind of interesting,</v>

213
00:13:08.311 --> 00:13:13.311
<v Speaker 1>but it was also a story that emerged in</v>
<v Speaker 1>solution to a problem I'd been thinking</v>

214
00:13:14.521 --> 00:13:17.760
<v Speaker 1>about for a long time because I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing with this guy who didn't want to</v>

215
00:13:17.761 --> 00:13:20.460
<v Speaker 1>grow up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's caught in a kind of peter pan</v>

216
00:13:20.461 --> 00:13:23.400
<v Speaker 1>situation and peter pan pan means</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

217
00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:24.263
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pan,</v>

218
00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:28.200
<v Speaker 1>like pantheistic and peter pan is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>child who won't grow up.</v>

219
00:13:28.201 --> 00:13:29.460
<v Speaker 1>Now he's magical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

220
00:13:29.461 --> 00:13:30.121
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

221
00:13:30.121 --> 00:13:31.800
<v Speaker 1>Children live in a magical world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

222
00:13:31.801 --> 00:13:34.620
<v Speaker 1>They're rife with possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's magical.</v>

223
00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:39.060
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't want to grow up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he lives in neverland with the lost</v>

224
00:13:39.061 --> 00:13:41.310
<v Speaker 1>boys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neverland doesn't really exist in the</v>

225
00:13:41.311 --> 00:13:46.311
<v Speaker 1>lost boys are obviously boys who haven't</v>
<v Speaker 1>managed to establish some mode of being</v>

226
00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:50.990
<v Speaker 1>and he's in constant battle with captain</v>
<v Speaker 1>hook and captain hook's a tyrant,</v>

227
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:51.811
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A pirate,</v>

228
00:13:51.811 --> 00:13:56.640
<v Speaker 1>a negative manifestation of the negative</v>
<v Speaker 1>archetype of social order.</v>

229
00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:01.140
<v Speaker 1>And captain hook is always fighting</v>
<v Speaker 1>peter pan because peter pan represents</v>

230
00:14:01.141 --> 00:14:03.930
<v Speaker 1>childhood and vulnerability and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't want to be vulnerable,</v>

231
00:14:03.931 --> 00:14:08.931
<v Speaker 1>so they're locked in this sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>eternal bout and lots of people I think</v>

232
00:14:09.421 --> 00:14:14.421
<v Speaker 1>more commonly men but not necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 1>get caught in this peter pan problem.</v>

233
00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:17.640
<v Speaker 1>So I was dealing wiTh</v>

234
00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:23.050
<v Speaker 1>person who was caught in this situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't want to grow up,</v>

235
00:14:23.051 --> 00:14:28.051
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't sacrifice childhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so this story popped into my head.</v>

236
00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:33.550
<v Speaker 1>It's called cock-a-doodle-doo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once upon a time there was a man who had</v>

237
00:14:33.551 --> 00:14:37.420
<v Speaker 1>a long hard journey ahead of him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was trudging along the way over</v>

238
00:14:37.421 --> 00:14:41.080
<v Speaker 1>boulders and through brushes when he saw</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little shiny him with big white teeth</v>

239
00:14:41.081 --> 00:14:43.330
<v Speaker 1>and the black toupee sitting by the side</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the road,</v>

240
00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:49.250
<v Speaker 1>he was drumming on a log with two white</v>
<v Speaker 1>bones and humming oddly to himself.</v>

241
00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:52.370
<v Speaker 1>The little gnome said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>john,</v>

242
00:14:52.371 --> 00:14:55.340
<v Speaker 1>why woRk so hard?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why I walked so fast?</v>

243
00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:57.470
<v Speaker 1>Who knows if you'll ever get there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

244
00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:00.170
<v Speaker 1>come over here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have something to show you.</v>

245
00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:04.100
<v Speaker 1>So john walked off the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was sick of walking anyway because</v>

246
00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:07.700
<v Speaker 1>people kept throwing sticks and stones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adam little gnome said,</v>

247
00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:12.200
<v Speaker 1>I have a shiny red jewel that I would</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to sell you cheap.</v>

248
00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:15.890
<v Speaker 1>Here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for beneath his cloak,</v>

249
00:15:15.891 --> 00:15:18.080
<v Speaker 1>he pulled the biggest ruby that the man</v>
<v Speaker 1>had ever seen.</v>

250
00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:21.560
<v Speaker 1>It must've weighed 100 pounds and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>shown like the sun.</v>

251
00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:25.010
<v Speaker 1>The gnome said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you like it?</v>

252
00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:28.790
<v Speaker 1>It'S an enchanted stone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What will you offer me for it?</v>

253
00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:31.910
<v Speaker 1>And the man said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have much,</v>

254
00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.430
<v Speaker 1>much money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll give you everything.</v>

255
00:15:34.431 --> 00:15:37.010
<v Speaker 1>I have the known look displeased.</v>

256
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:39.950
<v Speaker 1>So john added,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could pay some more monthly.</v>

257
00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:42.950
<v Speaker 1>So the gnome excepted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fair enough,</v>

258
00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:44.180
<v Speaker 1>buy now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pay later.</v>

259
00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:47.750
<v Speaker 1>Sounds good for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm all for the installment plan.</v>

260
00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:52.130
<v Speaker 1>So the man gave the gnome all his money</v>
<v Speaker 1>and promise to pay the rest later,</v>

261
00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:54.470
<v Speaker 1>and the gnome walk back into the bush by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the road,</v>

262
00:15:54.471 --> 00:15:56.570
<v Speaker 1>clacking his teeth and giggling and</v>
<v Speaker 1>twitching.</v>

263
00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:01.340
<v Speaker 1>The more the man thought about this ruby</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the great deal he got,</v>

264
00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:04.310
<v Speaker 1>the happier he became.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He started back on the road with a light</v>

265
00:16:04.311 --> 00:16:06.320
<v Speaker 1>heart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but soon discovered that he couldn't</v>

266
00:16:06.321 --> 00:16:09.500
<v Speaker 1>make much progress because 100 pounds</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a lot to carry.</v>

267
00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:12.380
<v Speaker 1>He said to himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why continue?</v>

268
00:16:12.381 --> 00:16:13.910
<v Speaker 1>anyways?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have what I want.</v>

269
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:17.090
<v Speaker 1>I'll just stand here holding my ruby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when people walk by,</v>

270
00:16:17.091 --> 00:16:22.091
<v Speaker 1>they can see how well I've already done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he stopped a little while.</v>

271
00:16:22.551 --> 00:16:24.920
<v Speaker 1>One of his little while later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of his friends came along,</v>

272
00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:26.000
<v Speaker 1>so I'm standing there.</v>

273
00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:28.130
<v Speaker 1>His friends said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>john,</v>

274
00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:31.610
<v Speaker 1>why don't you come along with me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've just opened a new business and I</v>

275
00:16:31.611 --> 00:16:34.130
<v Speaker 1>could really use some help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come along quick.</v>

276
00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:38.330
<v Speaker 1>it will be opening soon and thought that</v>
<v Speaker 1>sounded good.</v>

277
00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:40.640
<v Speaker 1>But his friend was in a hurry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said he couldn't.</v>

278
00:16:40.641 --> 00:16:44.360
<v Speaker 1>He see the ruby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How could he speed along beside him?</v>

279
00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:47.480
<v Speaker 1>Where would he put his jewel?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he said,</v>

280
00:16:47.481 --> 00:16:49.280
<v Speaker 1>thanks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have to take care of my jewel.</v>

281
00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:52.370
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'll see you later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His friend looked at him like he was</v>

282
00:16:52.371 --> 00:16:54.200
<v Speaker 1>crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was trying to get somewhere</v>

283
00:16:54.201 --> 00:16:56.510
<v Speaker 1>quick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he just shrugged a bit and said,</v>

284
00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:57.493
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>john,</v>

285
00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:00.710
<v Speaker 1>see you later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he sped on down the road.</v>

286
00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:03.080
<v Speaker 1>A little while later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another friend came by and he said,</v>

287
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:04.310
<v Speaker 1>john,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nice to see you.</v>

288
00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:07.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm going back to school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are lots of wonderful things to</v>

289
00:17:07.581 --> 00:17:09.230
<v Speaker 1>learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great things to do.</v>

290
00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:12.770
<v Speaker 1>The world is full of unsolved problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could use some company.</v>

291
00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:16.880
<v Speaker 1>What would you like to come along?</v>
<v Speaker 1>John thought that sounded pretty good,</v>

292
00:17:16.881 --> 00:17:18.800
<v Speaker 1>but this friend who looked like he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a hurry,</v>

293
00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:22.340
<v Speaker 1>he started standing beside the road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holding the jewel was tiring and he</v>

294
00:17:22.341 --> 00:17:25.670
<v Speaker 1>needed all the energy you had for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he said to his friend,</v>

295
00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:28.310
<v Speaker 1>thanks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have to take care of my jewel.</v>

296
00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:31.430
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it beautiful?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'll see you later.</v>

297
00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:33.560
<v Speaker 1>His friend looked at him like he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy,</v>

298
00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:35.360
<v Speaker 1>but he was trying to get somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 1>quick,</v>

299
00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:36.710
<v Speaker 1>so he just shrugged and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hope.</v>

300
00:17:36.711 --> 00:17:39.560
<v Speaker 1>Everything goes all right with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See you later.</v>

301
00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:43.700
<v Speaker 1>Many friends came and went.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the years,</v>

302
00:17:43.701 --> 00:17:46.280
<v Speaker 1>went by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the jewel got heavier and heavier,</v>

303
00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:48.890
<v Speaker 1>but the man got more and more attached</v>
<v Speaker 1>to it.</v>

304
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:52.650
<v Speaker 1>The only thing was nobody seemed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>notice how beautiful it was.</v>

305
00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:56.940
<v Speaker 1>People would rush by and talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>their plans and nobody had a ruby as big</v>

306
00:17:56.950 --> 00:18:01.380
<v Speaker 1>and nobody seemed likely to get a ruby</v>
<v Speaker 1>is big and you think that someone</v>

307
00:18:01.381 --> 00:18:05.360
<v Speaker 1>might've had said something like at</v>
<v Speaker 1>least nice ruby john,</v>

308
00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:08.700
<v Speaker 1>sure wish I had one like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it never happened.</v>

309
00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:11.940
<v Speaker 1>Then one day someone new came down the</v>
<v Speaker 1>road.</v>

310
00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.670
<v Speaker 1>He was bent over and he was thin and his</v>
<v Speaker 1>hair was gray.</v>

311
00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:18.210
<v Speaker 1>Although he didn't look that old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was carrying a big dirty rock</v>

312
00:18:18.211 --> 00:18:20.730
<v Speaker 1>carefully in his arms and he wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>making much progress.</v>

313
00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:24.090
<v Speaker 1>The strange figure approached and</v>
<v Speaker 1>glanced up at john.</v>

314
00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:28.140
<v Speaker 1>Then he grinned and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where are you standing there so stupidly</v>

315
00:18:28.141 --> 00:18:29.820
<v Speaker 1>with a big ugly rock and you're tired.</v>

316
00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:32.100
<v Speaker 1>Old hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You look pretty daft.</v>

317
00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:35.400
<v Speaker 1>I bet you wish you had a big ruby like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one I am carrying.</v>

318
00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:38.070
<v Speaker 1>And john thought this poor man is</v>
<v Speaker 1>diluted.</v>

319
00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:41.580
<v Speaker 1>He's carrying a rock because you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ruby.</v>

320
00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:42.900
<v Speaker 1>So he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>excuse me sir,</v>

321
00:18:42.901 --> 00:18:45.870
<v Speaker 1>but you are sadly mistaken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the one with the jewel.</v>

322
00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:49.320
<v Speaker 1>I met a little known by the side of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>road and he sold it to me.</v>

323
00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:53.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm still paying for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although not so very much.</v>

324
00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:56.880
<v Speaker 1>You are carrying a rock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tired.</v>

325
00:18:56.881 --> 00:18:58.050
<v Speaker 1>Stranger looked annoyed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

326
00:18:58.051 --> 00:18:59.520
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what game you're playing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mr.</v>

327
00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:02.280
<v Speaker 1>You have a rock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a jewel.</v>

328
00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:06.570
<v Speaker 1>The little gnome you described sold it</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me and he said it was the only one.</v>

329
00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:10.950
<v Speaker 1>I've been carrying it for 20 years and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll never let it go.</v>

330
00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:13.950
<v Speaker 1>And john said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'd been carrying mine for 20 years</v>

331
00:19:13.951 --> 00:19:14.400
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

332
00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:18.600
<v Speaker 1>it can be just a rock rocker jewel on</v>
<v Speaker 1>and on.</v>

333
00:19:18.601 --> 00:19:21.120
<v Speaker 1>They argued.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly I would step the little gnome</v>

334
00:19:21.121 --> 00:19:24.090
<v Speaker 1>as if he'd never left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only this time he wasn't so little,</v>

335
00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:27.660
<v Speaker 1>he was bigger and redder and menacing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and his laugh sounded like the rattling</v>

336
00:19:27.661 --> 00:19:30.750
<v Speaker 1>of chains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quit arguing youtube.</v>

337
00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:33.450
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen a site quite so</v>
<v Speaker 1>pathetic.</v>

338
00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:37.500
<v Speaker 1>You're carrying rocks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both of you and if you would have ever</v>

339
00:19:37.501 --> 00:19:39.780
<v Speaker 1>had the sense to put them down for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>second or two,</v>

340
00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:43.350
<v Speaker 1>you would have seen that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh well,</v>

341
00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:46.200
<v Speaker 1>at least you were diligent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I played a mean trick.</v>

342
00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:50.190
<v Speaker 1>I feel bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to give you What you really</v>

343
00:19:50.191 --> 00:19:53.850
<v Speaker 1>deserve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you want what you really deserve?</v>

344
00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:56.940
<v Speaker 1>and john and the thin stranger nodded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eagerly.</v>

345
00:19:56.970 --> 00:20:00.390
<v Speaker 1>finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they thought you haven't seen anything</v>

346
00:20:00.391 --> 00:20:02.730
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's wrote down your rocks.</v>

347
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:07.020
<v Speaker 1>So john and the thin stranger obeyed</v>
<v Speaker 1>each rock,</v>

348
00:20:07.021 --> 00:20:07.920
<v Speaker 1>split down the middle.</v>

349
00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:11.310
<v Speaker 1>When it hit the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>outflow the river of ravenous white</v>

350
00:20:11.311 --> 00:20:15.480
<v Speaker 1>worms which rushed towards the men and</v>
<v Speaker 1>devoured them whole while they thrashed</v>

351
00:20:15.481 --> 00:20:20.481
<v Speaker 1>about and screamed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Soon nothing was left except a leg bone</v>

352
00:20:20.611 --> 00:20:24.030
<v Speaker 1>from each.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The little gnome pick them up and walked</v>

353
00:20:24.031 --> 00:20:27.720
<v Speaker 1>off the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He sat down by a hollow log and started</v>

354
00:20:27.721 --> 00:20:31.610
<v Speaker 1>to drum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He drummed any waited and he hummed and</v>

355
00:20:31.611 --> 00:20:36.611
<v Speaker 1>hawed a little tune</v>
<v Speaker 1>picture of food feeds the whole Hungary</v>

356
00:20:37.381 --> 00:20:39.930
<v Speaker 1>clan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the image of good mix,</v>

357
00:20:39.931 --> 00:20:43.830
<v Speaker 1>the whole healthy men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why walk for miles?</v>

358
00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:46.590
<v Speaker 1>Why do the work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just smile.</v>

359
00:20:46.591 --> 00:20:49.990
<v Speaker 1>The smile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>success after all is a quirk.</v>

360
00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:53.140
<v Speaker 1>Life isn't real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the message I give.</v>

361
00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:56.770
<v Speaker 1>It's easy that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus who wants to live?</v>

362
00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:06.540
<v Speaker 1>So needless to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy that I was telling this story to</v>

363
00:21:06.541 --> 00:21:10.320
<v Speaker 1>never listened to it and things really</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't go well for him for a long,</v>

364
00:21:10.321 --> 00:21:14.700
<v Speaker 1>long time and they really didn't go well</v>
<v Speaker 1>for him until he was willing to give up</v>

365
00:21:14.701 --> 00:21:16.800
<v Speaker 1>some of the things he was carrying</v>
<v Speaker 1>along.</v>

366
00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:19.080
<v Speaker 1>So he had acquired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

367
00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:24.390
<v Speaker 1>a numBer of things that he couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>afford and the fact that he was carrying</v>

368
00:21:24.391 --> 00:21:26.730
<v Speaker 1>them right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>paying for them month after month,</v>

369
00:21:26.731 --> 00:21:28.890
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't afford to get an education,</v>

370
00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:33.420
<v Speaker 1>was perfectly willing to sacrifice the</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility of getting an education for</v>

371
00:21:33.421 --> 00:21:36.510
<v Speaker 1>the image of success rather than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>reverse.</v>

372
00:21:36.511 --> 00:21:38.970
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was completely irritated that the</v>

373
00:21:38.971 --> 00:21:42.120
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he had all these trappings of</v>

374
00:21:42.121 --> 00:21:43.950
<v Speaker 1>success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which no one he admired,</v>

375
00:21:43.951 --> 00:21:46.800
<v Speaker 1>also admired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he absolutely wasn't getting</v>

376
00:21:46.801 --> 00:21:49.950
<v Speaker 1>anywhere and he thought that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendously unfair,</v>

377
00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:53.640
<v Speaker 1>but the truth of the matter was that</v>
<v Speaker 1>how'd he put down what he was carrying</v>

378
00:21:53.641 --> 00:21:56.430
<v Speaker 1>for even a moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then he would have been able to get to</v>

379
00:21:56.431 --> 00:22:01.431
<v Speaker 1>where he wanted to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a motif that succinctly and</v>

380
00:22:03.331 --> 00:22:07.890
<v Speaker 1>dramatically describes the necessity for</v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice.</v>

381
00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:16.020
<v Speaker 1>One of the things you see in</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapy very,</v>

382
00:22:16.021 --> 00:22:21.021
<v Speaker 1>very commonly is that the person who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming for help does the same damn thing</v>

383
00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:26.880
<v Speaker 1>over and over and over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And every time they do it,</v>

384
00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:31.680
<v Speaker 1>it has the same consequence bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they ended up with the same kind of.</v>

385
00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:34.560
<v Speaker 1>They ended up in the same kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>

386
00:22:34.561 --> 00:22:36.060
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It starts out well,</v>

387
00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:38.820
<v Speaker 1>and the person turns against them and</v>
<v Speaker 1>starts to abuse them.</v>

388
00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:42.060
<v Speaker 1>They get abused repeatedly than a dan's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they meet someone else and the</v>

389
00:22:42.061 --> 00:22:44.100
<v Speaker 1>cycle continues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem to matter who they're</v>

390
00:22:44.101 --> 00:22:46.350
<v Speaker 1>out with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either they pick a person like this or</v>

391
00:22:46.351 --> 00:22:48.300
<v Speaker 1>they turn the person into someone like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

392
00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:52.380
<v Speaker 1>They lose jobs the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are there educational hopes failed the</v>

393
00:22:52.381 --> 00:22:53.910
<v Speaker 1>same way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

394
00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:55.290
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the person thinks,</v>

395
00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:58.740
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the structure of the world is so unfair.</v>

396
00:22:58.741 --> 00:23:01.080
<v Speaker 1>Everyone else seems to be getting along</v>
<v Speaker 1>just fine,</v>

397
00:23:01.081 --> 00:23:03.420
<v Speaker 1>but me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get hit in the head over and over</v>

398
00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:04.920
<v Speaker 1>exactly the same way.</v>

399
00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:06.330
<v Speaker 1>And then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

400
00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:10.050
<v Speaker 1>what is the structure of the world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

401
00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:11.700
<v Speaker 1>And then you remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

402
00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:15.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the things you don't understand</v>

403
00:23:15.151 --> 00:23:19.050
<v Speaker 1>and there's the things you do understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the things you do understand</v>

404
00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:23.250
<v Speaker 1>structure you and protect you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know sometimes the things you do</v>

405
00:23:23.251 --> 00:23:26.220
<v Speaker 1>understand are the right things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

406
00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:29.280
<v Speaker 1>You're valuing something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're carrying something that's an</v>

407
00:23:29.281 --> 00:23:34.050
<v Speaker 1>impediment to your further progress and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's frequently the case that it's the</v>

408
00:23:34.051 --> 00:23:37.440
<v Speaker 1>kind of impediment that under no</v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions do you want to give up</v>

409
00:23:37.441 --> 00:23:39.330
<v Speaker 1>because there's something about you that</v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

410
00:23:39.331 --> 00:23:42.170
<v Speaker 1>like john says about the ruby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

411
00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:45.170
<v Speaker 1>it's a ruby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who the hell cares if it weighs 100</v>

412
00:23:45.171 --> 00:23:47.240
<v Speaker 1>pounds and I have to stand by the road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

413
00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:51.410
<v Speaker 1>I still got the ruby and all you'd ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to do is put the damn thing down</v>

414
00:23:51.411 --> 00:23:53.600
<v Speaker 1>and wander off and everything would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>just fine,</v>

415
00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:55.100
<v Speaker 1>but you won't do it.</v>

416
00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:57.770
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you don't want to give up what</v>

417
00:23:57.771 --> 00:24:00.320
<v Speaker 1>you know because you don't want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice anything.</v>

418
00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:04.400
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>long before people had any psychological</v>

419
00:24:04.401 --> 00:24:08.230
<v Speaker 1>acumen or any psychological knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd already figured out that if you</v>

420
00:24:08.231 --> 00:24:13.231
<v Speaker 1>are going to take on a figure like this</v>
<v Speaker 1>and expect to get absolutely anywhere</v>

421
00:24:14.541 --> 00:24:17.210
<v Speaker 1>with her right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the horrors of the world,</v>

422
00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:21.110
<v Speaker 1>you bloody well better be willing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice whatever is necessary to keep</v>

423
00:24:21.111 --> 00:24:23.690
<v Speaker 1>you going along your path right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>

424
00:24:23.691 --> 00:24:25.370
<v Speaker 1>the things that you have to sacrifice</v>
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>

425
00:24:25.371 --> 00:24:26.990
<v Speaker 1>often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things that you're most</v>

426
00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:32.200
<v Speaker 1>particularly compelled by our grip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by or value the things that you want to</v>

427
00:24:32.421 --> 00:24:37.130
<v Speaker 1>give up least,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why in archaic societies where</v>

428
00:24:37.131 --> 00:24:40.190
<v Speaker 1>all of this is dramatized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people's sacrifice,</v>

429
00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:47.400
<v Speaker 1>an animal that they value particularly</v>
<v Speaker 1>or earlier than that even a child that</v>

430
00:24:48.811 --> 00:24:53.811
<v Speaker 1>they value particularly right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dramatically portraying the idea of</v>

431
00:24:53.851 --> 00:24:56.490
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to give something up if you</v>

432
00:24:56.491 --> 00:25:00.270
<v Speaker 1>Want to make an inroad on what she</v>
<v Speaker 1>represents,</v>

433
00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:05.220
<v Speaker 1>and so then you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the purpose of sacrifice is to turn the</v>

434
00:25:05.221 --> 00:25:09.330
<v Speaker 1>terrible aspect of the world into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>benevolent aspect of the world,</v>

435
00:25:09.331 --> 00:25:14.331
<v Speaker 1>and this is diana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a hindu goddess of a greek or roman</v>

436
00:25:14.881 --> 00:25:16.410
<v Speaker 1>goddess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same</v>

437
00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:23.700
<v Speaker 1>idea applies in the hindu case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you make the appropriate sacrifices,</v>

438
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.290
<v Speaker 1>then the terrible aspect of the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>turns into the benevolent aspect of the</v>

439
00:25:28.291 --> 00:25:33.270
<v Speaker 1>world and it is the case that even</v>
<v Speaker 1>empirical studies of success indicate</v>

440
00:25:33.271 --> 00:25:35.610
<v Speaker 1>that intelligence is a handy thing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

441
00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:38.640
<v Speaker 1>but hard work and dedication is a handy</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing to have to.</v>

442
00:25:38.641 --> 00:25:42.390
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly willing to sacrifice the</v>

443
00:25:42.391 --> 00:25:46.980
<v Speaker 1>impulsive pleasure of the president for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hopes of payback in the future.</v>

444
00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:50.370
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you sacrifice immediate gratification to</v>

445
00:25:50.371 --> 00:25:53.670
<v Speaker 1>obtain an appropriate social role to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take your place in society.</v>

446
00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:55.860
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely a sacrifice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

447
00:25:56.130 --> 00:26:01.070
<v Speaker 1>Because you put off pleasures in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>moment to obtain longterm stability in</v>

448
00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:06.360
<v Speaker 1>productivity</v>
<v Speaker 1>to turn the world into this</v>

449
00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:11.580
<v Speaker 1>and so then you can say,</v>

450
00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:16.650
<v Speaker 1>this is how the world falls apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As it's explored,</v>

451
00:26:16.651 --> 00:26:18.090
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so first of all,</v>

452
00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:21.890
<v Speaker 1>there's the thing that you can't even</v>
<v Speaker 1>name that only fills you with dread,</v>

453
00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:26.790
<v Speaker 1>but also with a sense of possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that manifests itself in your life</v>

454
00:26:26.791 --> 00:26:29.400
<v Speaker 1>as something concrete that you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

455
00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:33.000
<v Speaker 1>promising and threat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that divides itself up into those</v>

456
00:26:33.001 --> 00:26:37.650
<v Speaker 1>aspects of the world that you value in</v>
<v Speaker 1>and admire and that whole promise for</v>

457
00:26:37.651 --> 00:26:40.110
<v Speaker 1>you and those aspects of the world that</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>

458
00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:44.730
<v Speaker 1>And that's a differentiation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a consequence of exploration.</v>

459
