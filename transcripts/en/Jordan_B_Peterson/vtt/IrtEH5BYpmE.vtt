46
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.360
<v Speaker 3>thank you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you were speaking earlier about how</v>

47
00:03:13.361 --> 00:03:17.560
<v Speaker 3>much it should cost to come to the </v>

48
00:03:17.561 --> 00:03:18.394
<v Speaker 3>house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have known people that have mortgaged </v>

49
00:03:19.301 --> 00:03:22.680
<v Speaker 3>their houses for the emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

50
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.513
<v Speaker 3>but I just want to tell you one little </v>
<v Speaker 3>story about this teaching on the </v>

51
00:03:26.501 --> 00:03:28.060
<v Speaker 3>environment at the University of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Michigan,</v>

52
00:03:28.061 --> 00:03:31.350
<v Speaker 3>which the opening session of it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eh,</v>

53
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:32.303
<v Speaker 3>had attracted 18,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>people to an auditorium and we had to </v>

54
00:03:35.711 --> 00:03:36.544
<v Speaker 3>turn people away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we had a special secret deal with </v>

55
00:03:38.951 --> 00:03:42.520
<v Speaker 3>the president of the university because </v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody got this place for free.</v>

56
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.680
<v Speaker 3>And I was a fundraiser for all of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

57
00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:47.043
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a big week long event that I </v>

58
00:03:48.791 --> 00:03:49.624
<v Speaker 3>won't go into details on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the funny thing about it was one </v>

59
00:03:52.211 --> 00:03:53.044
<v Speaker 3>night at home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get this phone call from a guy who I </v>

60
00:03:55.271 --> 00:03:57.970
<v Speaker 3>didn't know and tall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he introduced himself and he said,</v>

61
00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it is a,</v>

62
00:03:59.151 --> 00:03:59.984
<v Speaker 3>he had read our perspectives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which had been published in some books </v>

63
00:04:02.231 --> 00:04:03.064
<v Speaker 3>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

64
00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.973
<v Speaker 3>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a righteous at the </v>

65
00:04:05.291 --> 00:04:06.510
<v Speaker 3>university,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wants you to chart,</v>

66
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.820
<v Speaker 3>wants to charge you $5,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>for one night.</v>

67
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.760
<v Speaker 3>And I explained to him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of the university said,</v>

68
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.160
<v Speaker 3>nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but nobody gets this for free.</v>

69
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:16.250
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

70
00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:17.980
<v Speaker 3>you're no exceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've,</v>

71
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.500
<v Speaker 3>our group was called an act </v>
<v Speaker 3>environmental action now.</v>

72
00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.300
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

73
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.730
<v Speaker 3>we were preparing to raise the money and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

74
00:04:24.731 --> 00:04:26.440
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really like what you're doing.</v>

75
00:04:26.441 --> 00:04:29.080
<v Speaker 3>I'm prepared to give you $5,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>to support it,</v>

76
00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.310
<v Speaker 3>but I want you to go to the university </v>
<v Speaker 3>president and say my name,</v>

77
00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.410
<v Speaker 3>and then say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

78
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.700
<v Speaker 3>he would give $10,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the university agreed not to,</v>

79
00:04:39.701 --> 00:04:40.750
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

80
00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:41.360
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

81
00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.740
<v Speaker 3>charges 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the [inaudible].</v>

82
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.370
<v Speaker 3>So I phoned up the head of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>university development,</v>

83
00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.740
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who is president for that.</v>

84
00:04:50.741 --> 00:04:53.020
<v Speaker 3>And he immediately said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

85
00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.220
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he phoned you.</v>

86
00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:56.493
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>please come and see the president </v>

87
00:04:57.491 --> 00:04:58.324
<v Speaker 3>tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I go and the president of the </v>

88
00:05:00.371 --> 00:05:05.371
<v Speaker 3>University of Michigan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a labor negotiator and lawyer,</v>

89
00:05:05.951 --> 00:05:07.840
<v Speaker 3>I guess a very nice man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

90
00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.060
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I walked into his office and I have this</v>

91
00:05:10.061 --> 00:05:10.894
<v Speaker 3>kind of sheepish grin on his face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew before he opened his mouth that </v>

92
00:05:13.301 --> 00:05:14.134
<v Speaker 3>we'd won and it turned out this was one </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the biggest benefactors to the </v>

93
00:05:16.661 --> 00:05:18.880
<v Speaker 3>university.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in fact,</v>

94
00:05:18.881 --> 00:05:19.630
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

95
00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:20.463
<v Speaker 3>his family on guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his wife's family owned a newspaper </v>

96
00:05:23.351 --> 00:05:28.351
<v Speaker 3>chain running out of Chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And apparently her mother didn't want to</v>

97
00:05:28.631 --> 00:05:31.480
<v Speaker 3>give any money away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Her father wanted to give money away.</v>

98
00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.300
<v Speaker 3>So instead they gave it to the kids who </v>
<v Speaker 3>gave it to good causes,</v>

99
00:05:34.301 --> 00:05:35.770
<v Speaker 3>like the University of Michigan.</v>

100
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:39.490
<v Speaker 3>And so we got our money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the funny thing about all those pins</v>

101
00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.380
<v Speaker 3>and that and also the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

102
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:42.071
<v Speaker 3>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this spin,</v>

103
00:05:42.071 --> 00:05:46.780
<v Speaker 3>but those things that they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the funny thing about that was that the,</v>

104
00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.540
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>university put a condition that we could</v>

105
00:05:49.541 --> 00:05:53.140
<v Speaker 3>charge no more than 50 cents admission </v>
<v Speaker 3>to this events event.</v>

106
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.710
<v Speaker 3>So between selling the pins and the 50 </v>
<v Speaker 3>cent admissions,</v>

107
00:05:56.711 --> 00:05:58.730
<v Speaker 3>I was the financial finances,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

108
00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:59.810
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chairman.</v>

109
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:03.770
<v Speaker 3>So everyday I would go around campus and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had this great network of people that</v>

110
00:06:03.771 --> 00:06:05.960
<v Speaker 3>were selling pins and selling tickets </v>
<v Speaker 3>for the event.</v>

111
00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:07.343
<v Speaker 3>And I had a suitcase,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I think we still have our own </v>

112
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.830
<v Speaker 3>little silver suitcase.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there was a normal little suitcase,</v>

113
00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.270
<v Speaker 3>wasn't too big because it was filled </v>
<v Speaker 3>with coins.</v>

114
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:19.070
<v Speaker 3>So every afternoon I would try and </v>
<v Speaker 3>casually walk across for fear of getting</v>

115
00:06:19.071 --> 00:06:19.940
<v Speaker 3>robbed because it was</v>

116
00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:20.853
<v Speaker 4>fairly close to a rough city in Detroit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I be trying to be casual and my arm </v>

117
00:06:23.991 --> 00:06:27.710
<v Speaker 4>was beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

118
00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:31.000
<v Speaker 3>there was a Latin and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just gave a talk last night at,</v>

119
00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.943
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>w Pearson College on the West Coast to </v>

120
00:06:34.451 --> 00:06:37.180
<v Speaker 3>phd students from Royal Roads University</v>
<v Speaker 3>and needs very,</v>

121
00:06:37.181 --> 00:06:38.014
<v Speaker 3>very bright and competent young people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that go into the baccalaureate program </v>

122
00:06:41.021 --> 00:06:43.240
<v Speaker 3>and have the privilege of attending </v>
<v Speaker 3>Pearson College.</v>

123
00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:47.380
<v Speaker 3>And so I tried to give them a talk on </v>
<v Speaker 3>leaders,</v>

124
00:06:47.381 --> 00:06:48.214
<v Speaker 3>laggards in the rest of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I've been thinking about that </v>

125
00:06:50.531 --> 00:06:52.650
<v Speaker 3>already in what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

126
00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:53.583
<v Speaker 3>Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because in the oceans area we deal with </v>

127
00:06:55.691 --> 00:06:56.524
<v Speaker 3>leaders and there's lots of them and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>deal with lots of laggards who see the </v>

128
00:07:00.461 --> 00:07:03.370
<v Speaker 3>world in very narrow sorts of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

129
00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:04.263
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we also see the rest of us who are the </v>

130
00:07:06.101 --> 00:07:06.934
<v Speaker 3>people in this room that you and me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we can't all be experts in the </v>

131
00:07:10.361 --> 00:07:12.580
<v Speaker 3>oceans and I'm not expert on all sorts </v>
<v Speaker 3>of things.</v>

132
00:07:12.581 --> 00:07:13.414
<v Speaker 3>I go out for a frequent kayak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>writes and talks with a guy who's a </v>

133
00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:18.633
<v Speaker 3>physical oceanographer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the best in the field that this </v>

134
00:07:20.091 --> 00:07:21.540
<v Speaker 3>in Victoria.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

135
00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:22.420
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

136
00:07:22.421 --> 00:07:25.690
<v Speaker 3>he gets into discussions with me that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>have no idea what he's talking about.</v>

137
00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:26.743
<v Speaker 3>And I try and</v>

138
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:31.870
<v Speaker 4>like 200 foot waves and things like this</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I just don't understand because it's</v>

139
00:07:31.971 --> 00:07:32.190
<v Speaker 4>all</v>

140
00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:36.000
<v Speaker 3>mathematical and it's all been said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're all learners.</v>

141
00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:40.560
<v Speaker 3>We're all people who want to do good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we have to deal with some people who</v>

142
00:07:40.561 --> 00:07:43.900
<v Speaker 3>really have very strong vested interest </v>
<v Speaker 3>as well and who are,</v>

143
00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:45.900
<v Speaker 3>it'd be happy to take the last fish out </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the,</v>

144
00:07:45.901 --> 00:07:49.230
<v Speaker 3>see if they can put it into the money </v>
<v Speaker 3>from that into their pocket.</v>

145
00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:52.920
<v Speaker 3>So I'm going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>

146
00:07:52.921 --> 00:07:53.754
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we should give a Jordan and </v>

147
00:07:56.641 --> 00:07:58.230
<v Speaker 3>honorary something</v>

148
00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:01.280
<v Speaker 4>in ocean studies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ocean</v>

149
00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.620
<v Speaker 3>sciences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But Ocean studies is different and we do</v>

150
00:08:03.621 --> 00:08:04.454
<v Speaker 3>need psychologists and people with human</v>
<v Speaker 3>behavior understandings to bring the </v>

151
00:08:09.591 --> 00:08:13.040
<v Speaker 3>message out about the oceans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's been one of the problems.</v>

152
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:13.903
<v Speaker 3>Scientists don't do a very good job even</v>
<v Speaker 3>though they're very good scientists and </v>

153
00:08:17.721 --> 00:08:18.554
<v Speaker 3>some of them do fortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's people like Jacques </v>

154
00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:24.560
<v Speaker 3>Cousteau and so forth and many others </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that and organizations,</v>

155
00:08:24.561 --> 00:08:25.190
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

156
00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:27.620
<v Speaker 3>that really try hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Many of the big foundations,</v>

157
00:08:27.621 --> 00:08:31.160
<v Speaker 3>conservation international,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a whole range of ocean oriented,</v>

158
00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:32.420
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bodies and so forth.</v>

159
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:37.070
<v Speaker 3>But it's still not enough and it won't </v>
<v Speaker 3>be enough,</v>

160
00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:39.440
<v Speaker 3>I think until people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

161
00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:44.830
<v Speaker 3>who actually have a lot of interest in </v>
<v Speaker 3>oceans but wa but still lack feel.</v>

162
00:08:45.501 --> 00:08:48.380
<v Speaker 3>They lack the means to do things about </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

163
00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:49.151
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

164
00:08:49.151 --> 00:08:50.960
<v Speaker 3>and I would include,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

165
00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:51.823
<v Speaker 3>not the MPs and that are members of </v>
<v Speaker 3>parliament tend to understand the </v>

166
00:08:55.981 --> 00:08:56.550
<v Speaker 3>oceans.</v>

167
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:58.710
<v Speaker 3>And some people say to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they turn,</v>

168
00:08:58.711 --> 00:08:59.544
<v Speaker 3>if people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people in some places in Canada to </v>

169
00:09:01.021 --> 00:09:03.870
<v Speaker 3>turn their backs in the oceans are more </v>
<v Speaker 3>interested in agriculture and the things</v>

170
00:09:03.871 --> 00:09:04.704
<v Speaker 3>that happened on land.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's a strong feeling that people </v>

171
00:09:08.131 --> 00:09:08.964
<v Speaker 3>have that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our parliamentarians have not risen to </v>

172
00:09:12.391 --> 00:09:14.040
<v Speaker 3>the challenge even though they've </v>
<v Speaker 3>signed,</v>

173
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:15.023
<v Speaker 3>the government has signed those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things that </v>

174
00:09:17.401 --> 00:09:21.960
<v Speaker 3>differentiates us from Australia is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Australians generally,</v>

175
00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:23.910
<v Speaker 3>they all live in the course is one </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>

176
00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:25.890
<v Speaker 3>surf on it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fish from it,</v>

177
00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.650
<v Speaker 3>do everything near the water and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

178
00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:29.484
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they actually have the strong political </v>

179
00:09:31.291 --> 00:09:33.390
<v Speaker 3>will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's politicians there,</v>

180
00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:37.140
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who have taken the oceans as a cause and</v>

181
00:09:37.141 --> 00:09:38.310
<v Speaker 3>who are very powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

182
00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.140
<v Speaker 3>politicians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's helped a lot.</v>

183
00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:43.770
<v Speaker 3>And I'll come to that later in the talk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I want to start off.</v>

184
00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:44.591
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

185
00:09:44.591 --> 00:09:45.900
<v Speaker 3>I've got a lot to say.</v>

186
00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.930
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to try and say it as concisely</v>
<v Speaker 3>as I can in watch the clock.</v>

187
00:09:48.931 --> 00:09:51.660
<v Speaker 3>So we'll have some time for discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

188
00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:52.733
<v Speaker 3>and I want to start generally looking at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the global situation and then I want to </v>

189
00:09:57.391 --> 00:10:01.470
<v Speaker 3>home in on Canada because we as Canadian</v>
<v Speaker 3>sitting here and,</v>

190
00:10:01.471 --> 00:10:04.650
<v Speaker 3>and maybe some students who are not from</v>
<v Speaker 3>Canada here.</v>

191
00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:05.783
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the country where you're trying </v>

192
00:10:06.901 --> 00:10:09.600
<v Speaker 3>to understand right now how we do things</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's very,</v>

193
00:10:09.601 --> 00:10:11.070
<v Speaker 3>very important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

194
00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:13.740
<v Speaker 3>I think we're going to learn a lot from </v>
<v Speaker 3>other countries.</v>

195
00:10:13.741 --> 00:10:15.540
<v Speaker 3>Some of the Asian countries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good and bad,</v>

196
00:10:15.541 --> 00:10:17.460
<v Speaker 3>we'll learn that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've worked with,</v>

197
00:10:17.461 --> 00:10:19.770
<v Speaker 3>have some very interesting models for </v>
<v Speaker 3>fisheries management.</v>

198
00:10:19.771 --> 00:10:20.604
<v Speaker 3>China for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they say they laugh at our fisheries </v>

199
00:10:22.651 --> 00:10:23.840
<v Speaker 3>models.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me tell you the,</v>

200
00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:26.010
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the LLC for example,</v>

201
00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:26.873
<v Speaker 3>and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we haven't got the money or the time to </v>

202
00:10:29.041 --> 00:10:32.910
<v Speaker 3>be able to debate the finer points of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the models that you have.</v>

203
00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:37.020
<v Speaker 3>What we do is we just stop all fishing </v>
<v Speaker 3>during the spawning season for about two</v>

204
00:10:37.021 --> 00:10:37.854
<v Speaker 3>or three or four months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget exactly what it is in the </v>

205
00:10:39.211 --> 00:10:40.650
<v Speaker 3>summertime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>

206
00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:43.590
<v Speaker 3>And it isn't that they're doing it </v>
<v Speaker 3>perfectly,</v>

207
00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:46.890
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of elements of that simple </v>
<v Speaker 3>mechanism worked for them.</v>

208
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:48.023
<v Speaker 3>Maybe sometimes we need simpler things </v>
<v Speaker 3>rather than the very involved debate </v>

209
00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:53.423
<v Speaker 3>that goes on between the scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fishery scientists who tend to be </v>

210
00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:59.580
<v Speaker 3>all concerned about fishing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>population dynamics.</v>

211
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:00.833
<v Speaker 3>People like myself that deal with </v>
<v Speaker 3>ecosystems and think about food chains </v>

212
00:11:04.051 --> 00:11:06.270
<v Speaker 3>and think about habitat destruction and </v>
<v Speaker 3>so forth.</v>

213
00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:07.733
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then others who take yet another </v>

214
00:11:09.451 --> 00:11:10.284
<v Speaker 3>point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the fisheries economist who </v>

215
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:14.070
<v Speaker 3>said they get the price rate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

216
00:11:14.071 --> 00:11:14.904
<v Speaker 3>individually transferable quotas and all</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorts of exotica that I think are often </v>

217
00:11:19.411 --> 00:11:22.110
<v Speaker 3>useful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there is no simple answer.</v>

218
00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:23.183
<v Speaker 3>So I'm going to be filling in the blanks</v>
<v Speaker 3>here that Jordan has left me plenty to </v>

219
00:11:27.061 --> 00:11:27.894
<v Speaker 3>fill in.</v>

220
00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:28.711
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

221
00:11:28.711 --> 00:11:29.544
<v Speaker 3>and I'm going to be focusing a lot on </v>
<v Speaker 3>habitat a lot on the ecosystem because </v>

222
00:11:34.921 --> 00:11:37.830
<v Speaker 3>it's my belief that in addition to </v>
<v Speaker 3>worrying about fishing,</v>

223
00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:40.830
<v Speaker 3>you have to worry about what's happening</v>
<v Speaker 3>to where fish live,</v>

224
00:11:40.831 --> 00:11:41.664
<v Speaker 3>which is in the water feeding on things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that in that marvelous food chain there </v>

225
00:11:45.601 --> 00:11:47.220
<v Speaker 3>was described there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

226
00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:47.940
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

227
00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:48.773
<v Speaker 3>indeed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we don't take that into account in </v>

228
00:11:50.461 --> 00:11:51.294
<v Speaker 3>our decision making about fisheries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then we only know about a quarter of </v>

229
00:11:55.800 --> 00:12:00.320
<v Speaker 3>what's really happening out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I just want to remind us first of all</v>

230
00:12:00.321 --> 00:12:01.330
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

231
00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:06.100
<v Speaker 3>it's fair to say that our planet is </v>
<v Speaker 3>about water and the water is saltwater.</v>

232
00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:08.720
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>70% of the,</v>

233
00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:10.660
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the earth's surface is covered by it.</v>

234
00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:14.890
<v Speaker 3>We depend on every single person in this</v>
<v Speaker 3>planet,</v>

235
00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:19.780
<v Speaker 3>whether or not they live in Afghanistan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether they live in British Columbia,</v>

236
00:12:19.781 --> 00:12:23.230
<v Speaker 3>Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or Indonesia or any of the other places.</v>

237
00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:24.543
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we depend on a variety of ecological </v>

238
00:12:27.521 --> 00:12:30.550
<v Speaker 3>services from the oceans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I won't go into that right now.</v>

239
00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:31.463
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's very important to recognize </v>

240
00:12:33.131 --> 00:12:34.150
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Secondly,</v>

241
00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:37.780
<v Speaker 3>it is a history book of the Earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We look at the sediments,</v>

242
00:12:37.781 --> 00:12:38.614
<v Speaker 3>we know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>understand where we get our oxygen from </v>

243
00:12:40.511 --> 00:12:42.670
<v Speaker 3>and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's complex,</v>

244
00:12:42.671 --> 00:12:43.504
<v Speaker 3>but we can understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we also depend on that as we look </v>

245
00:12:47.321 --> 00:12:52.210
<v Speaker 3>for the resources we explained.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where do we find out about how anchovies</v>

246
00:12:52.211 --> 00:12:56.710
<v Speaker 3>go up and down because of El Nino and La</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nina from the ocean sediments.</v>

247
00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:59.620
<v Speaker 3>And we looked for the scales of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes essential meets there.</v>

248
00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:01.630
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes they're not there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

249
00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:05.500
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and our use sediments and so forth.</v>

250
00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:06.363
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that oil that we use is basically </v>

251
00:13:08.081 --> 00:13:11.470
<v Speaker 3>from phytoplankton from the sea and </v>
<v Speaker 3>other sea creatures.</v>

252
00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:12.533
<v Speaker 3>It.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

253
00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:13.583
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have to do understand that it's a </v>

254
00:13:15.161 --> 00:13:18.280
<v Speaker 3>basis of natural wealth and of our </v>
<v Speaker 3>prosperity,</v>

255
00:13:18.281 --> 00:13:23.050
<v Speaker 3>half the people in the planet live close</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the ocean and that is always going to</v>

256
00:13:23.051 --> 00:13:23.884
<v Speaker 3>be the case.</v>

257
00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:26.620
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their prosperity through trade,</v>

258
00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:30.130
<v Speaker 3>through fishing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>through all sorts of different things we</v>

259
00:13:30.131 --> 00:13:30.964
<v Speaker 3>know about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the oceans government's trade </v>

260
00:13:33.461 --> 00:13:37.630
<v Speaker 3>settlement patterns and it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we now know and understand where they're</v>

261
00:13:37.631 --> 00:13:38.464
<v Speaker 3>clearly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it also governs climate and therefore </v>

262
00:13:40.181 --> 00:13:43.270
<v Speaker 3>climate change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's also the source of conflict,</v>

263
00:13:43.271 --> 00:13:47.380
<v Speaker 3>calamity and crises.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't like to talk about crises,</v>

264
00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:48.820
<v Speaker 3>but I have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

265
00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:49.943
<v Speaker 3>and particularly in this talk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people say the ocean is in crisis and I </v>

266
00:13:54.431 --> 00:13:56.140
<v Speaker 3>think it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>frankly,</v>

267
00:13:56.141 --> 00:13:58.990
<v Speaker 3>despite all what we said at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>beginning of your talk,</v>

268
00:13:58.991 --> 00:14:01.990
<v Speaker 3>Jordan and I would like to think that </v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

269
00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:04.010
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

270
00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:07.000
<v Speaker 3>things are nice out there on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment globally.</v>

271
00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:07.863
<v Speaker 3>They're in a downhill turn for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a way of looking at crisis </v>

272
00:14:13.061 --> 00:14:14.800
<v Speaker 3>that I think it's very important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

273
00:14:14.801 --> 00:14:15.634
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go back to some of the experiences </v>

274
00:14:16.521 --> 00:14:17.740
<v Speaker 3>that has been a lot of time in China.</v>

275
00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:21.280
<v Speaker 3>China doesn't like to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 3>barriers,</v>

276
00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:23.560
<v Speaker 3>about not being able to do things and so</v>
<v Speaker 3>forth.</v>

277
00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:25.990
<v Speaker 3>What they cautioned me and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

278
00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:27.940
<v Speaker 3>talk about crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

279
00:14:27.941 --> 00:14:28.774
<v Speaker 3>If you wish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we understand we face crisis for a long </v>

280
00:14:31.541 --> 00:14:32.470
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We face crises.</v>

281
00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:37.840
<v Speaker 3>How do you turn crisis into opportunity?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's very important.</v>

282
00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:39.123
<v Speaker 3>Chinese do that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Crisis to opportunity and they actually </v>

283
00:14:41.651 --> 00:14:42.484
<v Speaker 3>do it often.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're able to solve the crises and </v>

284
00:14:44.381 --> 00:14:46.900
<v Speaker 3>they're better off open new </v>
<v Speaker 3>opportunities.</v>

285
00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:52.070
<v Speaker 3>I talked about what I call [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 3>crisis to sustainability.</v>

286
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:55.520
<v Speaker 3>How do we turn these things into a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sustainable development pattern?</v>

287
00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:57.470
<v Speaker 3>Not easy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not impossible.</v>

288
00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:58.873
<v Speaker 3>And particularly when I'm talking with </v>
<v Speaker 3>an audience and includes people of the </v>

289
00:15:02.571 --> 00:15:03.404
<v Speaker 3>next generation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to have to solve all the </v>

290
00:15:05.181 --> 00:15:06.014
<v Speaker 3>messes and problems and open the new </v>
<v Speaker 3>opportunities that come with new </v>

291
00:15:09.651 --> 00:15:10.930
<v Speaker 3>technologies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>etc.</v>

292
00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:13.940
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to leave you with a message</v>

293
00:15:13.941 --> 00:15:18.710
<v Speaker 3>of failure and a message of </v>
<v Speaker 3>impossibility.</v>

294
00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:23.950
<v Speaker 3>It has to be a message of opportunity </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then a message of hope and so forth.</v>

295
00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:27.980
<v Speaker 3>And I think we can apply that to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ocean.</v>

296
00:15:27.981 --> 00:15:28.814
<v Speaker 3>So some of the examples that I'm going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to present or things that seem to be </v>

297
00:15:31.701 --> 00:15:35.600
<v Speaker 3>going better now than they were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say 10 years or 20 years ago.</v>

298
00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:40.400
<v Speaker 3>So please keep that in mind if it gets </v>
<v Speaker 3>too gross and just remember,</v>

299
00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:41.423
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm basically an optimist and want to </v>

300
00:15:43.881 --> 00:15:44.714
<v Speaker 3>see hope for the future and hope that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the people who carry the burden forward </v>

301
00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:50.473
<v Speaker 3>and the institutions that I hope Finn </v>
<v Speaker 3>can become as at one of those can make </v>

302
00:15:55.161 --> 00:15:58.030
<v Speaker 3>real contributions to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking at Youth Finn,</v>

303
00:15:58.070 --> 00:15:58.903
<v Speaker 4>like that person over there and some of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the others that I met earlier this </v>

304
00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:03.343
<v Speaker 4>afternoon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really am honored that I can be here </v>

305
00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:07.223
<v Speaker 4>to</v>

306
00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:10.760
<v Speaker 3>kick off what I hope will be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>successful effort on the part,</v>

307
00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:14.880
<v Speaker 3>not just a view of t students but </v>
<v Speaker 3>students across the country.</v>

308
00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:16.013
<v Speaker 3>Because we need,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need this kind of support and </v>

309
00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:19.613
<v Speaker 3>understanding and real action that can </v>
<v Speaker 3>come out of the bigger people who carry </v>

310
00:16:25.171 --> 00:16:27.090
<v Speaker 3>challenges forward into the next </v>
<v Speaker 3>generation.</v>

311
00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:32.340
<v Speaker 3>The reason I was speaking at Pearson and</v>
<v Speaker 3>happy to do so here's in college is that</v>

312
00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:35.190
<v Speaker 3>I am going further and further down the </v>
<v Speaker 3>food chain.</v>

313
00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:36.870
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel that,</v>

314
00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:37.723
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have to be working in a very </v>

315
00:16:40.081 --> 00:16:44.550
<v Speaker 3>intelligent way and communicating with </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that are still in high schools,</v>

316
00:16:44.551 --> 00:16:48.730
<v Speaker 3>junior high schools and elementary </v>
<v Speaker 3>schools so that they come into the,</v>

317
00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:54.290
<v Speaker 3>the university world with an attitude of</v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibility to some extent,</v>

318
00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:56.933
<v Speaker 3>but understanding particularly of things</v>
<v Speaker 3>where they can make a difference in the </v>

319
00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:02.290
<v Speaker 3>years ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So those are some preliminary,</v>

320
00:17:02.291 --> 00:17:03.124
<v Speaker 3>the points.</v>

321
00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:06.630
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now we get into the nasty stuff.</v>

322
00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:07.763
<v Speaker 3>Ocean health and decline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to hear these things and </v>

323
00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:11.243
<v Speaker 3>there's a new index and I've given a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of words in some of these </v>

324
00:17:13.831 --> 00:17:15.990
<v Speaker 3>slides.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't even try and read them all,</v>

325
00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:17.760
<v Speaker 3>listened to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm just,</v>

326
00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:19.083
<v Speaker 3>we're trying to take a videotape of this</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we're going to intersperse some of </v>

327
00:17:23.341 --> 00:17:25.590
<v Speaker 3>the slides.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I want a little bit more detail.</v>

328
00:17:25.591 --> 00:17:26.424
<v Speaker 3>That's why I put it in here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also a ways that you can find this </v>

329
00:17:29.041 --> 00:17:29.874
<v Speaker 3>information easily.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's this new thing that people </v>

330
00:17:32.611 --> 00:17:35.130
<v Speaker 3>have been trying for some time to get an</v>
<v Speaker 3>integrated,</v>

331
00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:37.350
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>overview of ocean health.</v>

332
00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:40.230
<v Speaker 3>And you can see it's not very good </v>
<v Speaker 3>overall in the world.</v>

333
00:17:40.231 --> 00:17:43.430
<v Speaker 3>60 out of 100.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you go on the website,</v>

334
00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:45.290
<v Speaker 3>you can find what each country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

335
00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:46.980
<v Speaker 3>where it's good and not good.</v>

336
00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:49.560
<v Speaker 3>Interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Canada gets 70 out a hundred.</v>

337
00:17:49.561 --> 00:17:50.870
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

338
00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:54.480
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe we can a trumpet a success in some</v>

339
00:17:54.481 --> 00:17:57.090
<v Speaker 3>areas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I would say that,</v>

340
00:17:57.091 --> 00:17:57.924
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>certainly I don't see things in great </v>

341
00:17:59.851 --> 00:18:02.650
<v Speaker 3>shape right now in Canada in the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>way that Jordan,</v>

342
00:18:02.651 --> 00:18:03.360
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

343
00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:05.430
<v Speaker 3>an artist as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so let's,</v>

344
00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:07.470
<v Speaker 3>let's talk about health for just a </v>
<v Speaker 3>second.</v>

345
00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:10.890
<v Speaker 3>Two quick examples.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Beautiful place,</v>

346
00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:12.900
<v Speaker 3>a broken archipelago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

347
00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:15.070
<v Speaker 3>broaden archipelagos where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

348
00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:17.520
<v Speaker 3>Alexandra Morton and others,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

349
00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:18.510
<v Speaker 3>feel that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

350
00:18:18.511 --> 00:18:23.511
<v Speaker 3>the cage salmon that are aquaculture </v>
<v Speaker 3>there are carrying an excessive parasite</v>

351
00:18:23.581 --> 00:18:24.414
<v Speaker 3>load,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the wild salmon coming down the </v>

352
00:18:25.681 --> 00:18:28.140
<v Speaker 3>pink Simon for very remote rivers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

353
00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:32.700
<v Speaker 3>on the BC coast are picking up the </v>
<v Speaker 3>parasite load and dying off.</v>

354
00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:36.960
<v Speaker 3>This is a big tussle between science and</v>
<v Speaker 3>citizen science.</v>

355
00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:38.510
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

356
00:18:38.511 --> 00:18:39.344
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

357
00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:44.220
<v Speaker 3>I must say it's not a resolved issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm kind of on Alexandra Morton side,</v>

358
00:18:44.221 --> 00:18:45.054
<v Speaker 3>I think on this.</v>

359
00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:47.760
<v Speaker 3>But in general,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the health of the oceans,</v>

360
00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:50.820
<v Speaker 3>the health of ecosystems and what it </v>
<v Speaker 3>means to us,</v>

361
00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:51.733
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>brings it back right into economic </v>

362
00:18:52.531 --> 00:18:53.700
<v Speaker 3>terms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

363
00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:55.350
<v Speaker 3>this is another big puzzle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

364
00:18:55.351 --> 00:18:57.340
<v Speaker 3>this man who I spend a day with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

365
00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:59.760
<v Speaker 3>several years ago took this picture and </v>
<v Speaker 3>his doctor,</v>

366
00:18:59.761 --> 00:19:00.594
<v Speaker 3>Peter Ross,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's just lost this job because the </v>

367
00:19:02.851 --> 00:19:07.170
<v Speaker 3>whole group of people and toxicology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the deal with ocean toxicological issues</v>

368
00:19:07.171 --> 00:19:11.150
<v Speaker 3>paid for often by people from other </v>
<v Speaker 3>countries like the United States or a,</v>

369
00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:13.860
<v Speaker 3>and give us data that's absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 3>essential.</v>

370
00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:14.993
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from monitoring different Adam mainly </v>

371
00:19:17.851 --> 00:19:20.370
<v Speaker 3>seals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but up and down the coast so you can see</v>

372
00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:21.323
<v Speaker 3>where pollutants are coming across from </v>
<v Speaker 3>Asia because of they hit the northern </v>

373
00:19:23.791 --> 00:19:24.624
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can find out the effects of drugs </v>

374
00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:31.200
<v Speaker 3>and diseases that come out in their </v>
<v Speaker 3>sewage from cities like Vancouver.</v>

375
00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:33.710
<v Speaker 3>And then if you go down towards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

376
00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:34.893
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the southern part of what's now called </v>

377
00:19:35.701 --> 00:19:36.534
<v Speaker 3>the sailor's sea puget sound where </v>
<v Speaker 3>they've been building naval ships and </v>

378
00:19:39.271 --> 00:19:41.310
<v Speaker 3>you can find all that heavy metal issues</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so forth.</v>

379
00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:41.511
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

380
00:19:41.511 --> 00:19:42.344
<v Speaker 3>I get a feeling for things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there was a network that he was </v>

381
00:19:44.701 --> 00:19:45.980
<v Speaker 3>involved with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

382
00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:47.093
<v Speaker 3>and they've all lost their job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't seem to want that information </v>

383
00:19:49.651 --> 00:19:50.990
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

384
00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:51.843
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are we getting the right kind of </v>

385
00:19:52.261 --> 00:19:54.800
<v Speaker 3>information on the health of the oceans?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I would submit if,</v>

386
00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:58.270
<v Speaker 3>if we don't have people like Peter Ross,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

387
00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:01.860
<v Speaker 3>then it's quite difficult to get that </v>
<v Speaker 3>information.</v>

388
00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:04.420
<v Speaker 3>I should also add,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a hilarious working with him.</v>

389
00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:05.633
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd wearing a hockey helmet because </v>

390
00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:08.173
<v Speaker 3>there's two ways that you get the seals </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you don't really want to be the </v>

391
00:20:10.351 --> 00:20:11.610
<v Speaker 3>seal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The seal is going to live,</v>

392
00:20:11.611 --> 00:20:12.444
<v Speaker 3>but it's going to have a few scars after</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's been visited or she from Peter </v>

393
00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:18.230
<v Speaker 3>Ross.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>

394
00:20:18.231 --> 00:20:19.064
<v Speaker 3>the one way he likes to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you quietly go up in your boat and </v>

395
00:20:22.021 --> 00:20:22.854
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

396
00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:28.110
<v Speaker 3>put on your hockey helmet and then you </v>
<v Speaker 3>run like hell into the water and uh,</v>

397
00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:29.093
<v Speaker 3>under the shore and grabbed the seal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have to be of a certain size and </v>

398
00:20:31.131 --> 00:20:31.964
<v Speaker 3>they're standardized.</v>

399
00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:33.173
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're lucky you don't got your head </v>

400
00:20:33.991 --> 00:20:36.560
<v Speaker 3>on the rocks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>slippery rocks with lots of LG.</v>

401
00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:38.990
<v Speaker 3>The other way in which he doesn't want </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do it,</v>

402
00:20:38.991 --> 00:20:39.824
<v Speaker 3>but it also works is that a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the seal school in the water and then </v>

403
00:20:42.931 --> 00:20:44.060
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

404
00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:48.970
<v Speaker 3>he's got a thin nylon net out set out </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the seals go into the nab,</v>

405
00:20:48.971 --> 00:20:51.760
<v Speaker 3>their startle and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he tries to get the,</v>

406
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:52.833
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one or two sales and make sure that no </v>

407
00:20:54.341 --> 00:20:55.174
<v Speaker 3>others are in there and you get about </v>
<v Speaker 3>five minutes before the steels that are </v>

408
00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:59.080
<v Speaker 3>struggling and maybe withdrawn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

409
00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:00.213
<v Speaker 3>but he has been very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very good scientist and it pains me </v>

410
00:21:02.381 --> 00:21:03.580
<v Speaker 3>greatly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'll do fine.</v>

411
00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:08.950
<v Speaker 3>Whether that network can continue its </v>
<v Speaker 3>work properly is beyond me.</v>

412
00:21:10.511 --> 00:21:11.344
<v Speaker 3>I don't see how it can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>health is also about people in </v>

413
00:21:13.511 --> 00:21:14.910
<v Speaker 3>communities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

414
00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:17.950
<v Speaker 3>if you live on the west coast or on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>east coast,</v>

415
00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:21.790
<v Speaker 3>this is a prime thing that people feel </v>
<v Speaker 3>the loss,</v>

416
00:21:21.791 --> 00:21:25.750
<v Speaker 3>they feel the loss of livelihood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the loss of integrity,</v>

417
00:21:25.751 --> 00:21:26.584
<v Speaker 3>of work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they felt important over the years </v>

418
00:21:28.061 --> 00:21:31.180
<v Speaker 3>as fishermen or various other ocean </v>
<v Speaker 3>related,</v>

419
00:21:31.181 --> 00:21:32.014
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

420
00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:33.003
<v Speaker 3>activities.</v>

421
00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:34.083
<v Speaker 3>And whether it's in Prince Rupert,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in northern British Columbia or whether </v>

422
00:21:36.671 --> 00:21:37.420
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

423
00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:42.370
<v Speaker 3>in communities in the south shore of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>newfoundland or Nova Scotia.</v>

424
00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:46.900
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is this very serious issue and it's</v>

425
00:21:46.901 --> 00:21:51.610
<v Speaker 3>one that we don't seem to do as good a </v>
<v Speaker 3>job in Canada as places like Norway,</v>

426
00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:54.760
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and maybe Australia and handling.</v>

427
00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:57.010
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we can come back to that point,</v>

428
00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:58.473
<v Speaker 3>a new line,</v>
<v Speaker 3>new livelihoods and merge Lunenburg a </v>

429
00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:03.160
<v Speaker 3>school of sailing school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That beautiful schooner,</v>

430
00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:05.080
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sea kayaking,</v>

431
00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:08.440
<v Speaker 3>a summer thing we'll watching.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

432
00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:13.650
<v Speaker 3>and interestingly if you were into music</v>
<v Speaker 3>folk festivals and the the folk festival</v>

433
00:22:14.521 --> 00:22:15.354
<v Speaker 3>and part of it is held right on the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the seashore and boats come and go </v>

434
00:22:18.521 --> 00:22:21.040
<v Speaker 3>like this beautiful big one in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>background in middle of the picture,</v>

435
00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:26.320
<v Speaker 3>but this also calamity in the oceans and</v>
<v Speaker 3>calamity takes many forms.</v>

436
00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:29.230
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cyclone Nargis for example,</v>

437
00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:29.830
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

438
00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:34.830
<v Speaker 3>in Burma where over almost 140,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>people were killed by terrible Maldives.</v>

439
00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:40.690
<v Speaker 3>The prime spokes country for climate </v>
<v Speaker 3>change,</v>

440
00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:46.180
<v Speaker 3>melt ice basically disappear with sea </v>
<v Speaker 3>level rise in that given amount of time.</v>

441
00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:47.373
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then there's the insidious kinds of </v>

442
00:22:48.851 --> 00:22:53.470
<v Speaker 3>things like ocean acidification,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I won't go through this slide,</v>

443
00:22:53.471 --> 00:22:58.180
<v Speaker 3>but just to say that oceans and climate </v>
<v Speaker 3>change are intimately related,</v>

444
00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:03.570
<v Speaker 3>but don't get nearly as much attention </v>
<v Speaker 3>as the atmospheric side of things.</v>

445
00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:04.563
<v Speaker 3>I happen to think that on both the </v>
<v Speaker 3>mitigation side and just the general </v>

446
00:23:09.341 --> 00:23:10.174
<v Speaker 3>scientific knowledge base,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the oceans are basically still </v>

447
00:23:13.691 --> 00:23:16.180
<v Speaker 3>largely ignored compared to their </v>
<v Speaker 3>significance.</v>

448
00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:18.303
<v Speaker 3>Then we go on to things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is an area that I'm very </v>

449
00:23:20.501 --> 00:23:22.810
<v Speaker 3>familiar with and this brings me to </v>
<v Speaker 3>tears sometimes.</v>

450
00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:26.410
<v Speaker 3>There's an area of the world called the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Coral Triangle,</v>

451
00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:29.590
<v Speaker 3>Indonesia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Philippines,</v>

452
00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:33.300
<v Speaker 3>parts of Malaysia and parts of Papua New</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guinea area.</v>

453
00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:37.240
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is the leading center for ocean</v>

454
00:23:37.241 --> 00:23:38.470
<v Speaker 3>biodiversity in the world.</v>

455
00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:39.813
<v Speaker 3>It's the thing that drove me first to </v>
<v Speaker 3>live in Indonesia was the fact that I </v>

456
00:23:43.991 --> 00:23:47.480
<v Speaker 3>was working in the Caribbean on </v>
<v Speaker 3>something for my master's thesis.</v>

457
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:52.990
<v Speaker 3>And I realized that for every species of</v>
<v Speaker 3>this little crab that I was looking at,</v>

458
00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:56.420
<v Speaker 3>there was a six or seven species and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>coral triangle area,</v>

459
00:23:57.050 --> 00:23:57.883
<v Speaker 3>if you go to that area,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that reefs are being destroyed at an </v>

460
00:24:00.651 --> 00:24:04.160
<v Speaker 3>incredible rate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Partly it's stupidity,</v>

461
00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:08.030
<v Speaker 3>it's greed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's market demand for certain things.</v>

462
00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:13.270
<v Speaker 3>I could go on Fisher poisoned so he can </v>
<v Speaker 3>get maybe a 10th of them for aquarium,</v>

463
00:24:14.241 --> 00:24:14.961
<v Speaker 3>fish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>salt water,</v>

464
00:24:14.961 --> 00:24:17.360
<v Speaker 3>aquarium,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fish that's coming under control a bit.</v>

465
00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:18.973
<v Speaker 3>People go off and risk their lives to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have in the last decades risk their </v>

466
00:24:24.141 --> 00:24:26.930
<v Speaker 3>lives to go into old munitions dump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

467
00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:28.610
<v Speaker 3>dumps in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

468
00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:32.200
<v Speaker 3>west Papuan in Papua New Guinea to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to uh,</v>

469
00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:33.133
<v Speaker 3>take the explosives to take them out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the shells and then go back and blow up </v>

470
00:24:36.231 --> 00:24:37.064
<v Speaker 3>reese with them.</v>

471
00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:40.610
<v Speaker 3>And I've seen these raves in some cases,</v>
<v Speaker 3>small islands for example,</v>

472
00:24:40.611 --> 00:24:43.870
<v Speaker 3>in South Sulawesi where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where the,</v>

473
00:24:43.871 --> 00:24:44.704
<v Speaker 3>the very lives of people depend on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>integrity of the reef because they </v>

474
00:24:47.721 --> 00:24:50.600
<v Speaker 3>protect the small islands around where </v>
<v Speaker 3>people live.</v>

475
00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:51.973
<v Speaker 3>And still people will come in from </v>
<v Speaker 3>outside and blow off the reefs just to </v>

476
00:24:54.471 --> 00:24:55.760
<v Speaker 3>get the fish done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fish,</v>

477
00:24:55.761 --> 00:24:58.040
<v Speaker 3>take the fish goodbye,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go to another reef.</v>

478
00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:01.280
<v Speaker 3>And the damage that's rigged and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>process is,</v>

479
00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:02.123
<v Speaker 3>is quite incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll come back to the coral triangle </v>

480
00:25:04.041 --> 00:25:07.490
<v Speaker 3>because the countries now recognize </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

481
00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:08.563
<v Speaker 3>that it's urgent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is a crisis situation and they're </v>

482
00:25:11.211 --> 00:25:13.190
<v Speaker 3>trying their best to do a number of </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

483
00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:17.120
<v Speaker 3>One of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the important points is that they</v>

484
00:25:17.121 --> 00:25:19.940
<v Speaker 3>talk about a blue carbon budget.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>

485
00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:22.760
<v Speaker 3>the reefs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they're properly managed and not will</v>

486
00:25:22.761 --> 00:25:27.650
<v Speaker 3>extract a great deal of a greenhouse </v>
<v Speaker 3>gases as a consequence of the reef being</v>

487
00:25:27.651 --> 00:25:29.330
<v Speaker 3>there and more or less do it </v>
<v Speaker 3>permanently.</v>

488
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:33.380
<v Speaker 3>So there's always good news and there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>lots of bad news,</v>

489
00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:35.770
<v Speaker 3>West Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

490
00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:38.930
<v Speaker 3>the fishing the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the term,</v>

491
00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:40.213
<v Speaker 3>which I don't really like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a illegal unreported and it's </v>

492
00:25:44.781 --> 00:25:46.580
<v Speaker 3>unsustainable as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

493
00:25:46.581 --> 00:25:47.414
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fishing.</v>

494
00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:48.543
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is one of the prime areas that </v>

495
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.730
<v Speaker 3>is um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

496
00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:55.640
<v Speaker 3>bringing people in from the surrounding </v>
<v Speaker 3>countries and taking fish,</v>

497
00:25:55.650 --> 00:25:57.830
<v Speaker 3>cod,</v>
<v Speaker 3>taking fishing illegally.</v>

498
00:25:58.130 --> 00:26:02.570
<v Speaker 3>And then these fish will be transported </v>
<v Speaker 3>office as a Korean vessel on the bottom.</v>

499
00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:06.920
<v Speaker 3>So it will be transported to Korea I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibly through Europe,</v>

500
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:07.710
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

501
00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:10.730
<v Speaker 3>and some sold in theU as well on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bottom.</v>

502
00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:11.591
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

503
00:26:11.591 --> 00:26:12.424
<v Speaker 3>a mothership with a illegal trawlers </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are out there and there's now </v>

504
00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:19.670
<v Speaker 3>spotting mechanisms where the local </v>
<v Speaker 3>populations,</v>

505
00:26:19.671 --> 00:26:23.420
<v Speaker 3>because as was already said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people now have access to equipment like</v>

506
00:26:23.421 --> 00:26:24.254
<v Speaker 3>this waterproof cameras and this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that and the other access to the </v>

507
00:26:26.871 --> 00:26:29.660
<v Speaker 3>internet to know exactly which chip it </v>
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

508
00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:30.503
<v Speaker 3>It's a fishing and people that go out in</v>
<v Speaker 3>their canoes and take pictures and then </v>

509
00:26:34.131 --> 00:26:34.964
<v Speaker 3>report that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this was one of the interesting </v>

510
00:26:36.531 --> 00:26:39.350
<v Speaker 3>things that technology can be very </v>
<v Speaker 3>helpful in this process.</v>

511
00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:40.963
<v Speaker 3>And then finally I'm going to talk quite</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bit this evening about the Arctic </v>

512
00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:45.420
<v Speaker 3>changing environment and development </v>
<v Speaker 3>pressures.</v>

513
00:26:45.421 --> 00:26:49.110
<v Speaker 3>These are some photos I wish I had been </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a nice position to be able to fake.</v>

514
00:26:49.111 --> 00:26:51.960
<v Speaker 3>These are taken by department of </v>
<v Speaker 3>fisheries and oceans staff,</v>

515
00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:53.363
<v Speaker 3>but in our whales and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>belugas coming up in the little areas </v>

516
00:26:58.050 --> 00:26:59.910
<v Speaker 3>that are open in the Arctic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

517
00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:03.090
<v Speaker 3>we know there's going to be lots more </v>
<v Speaker 3>areas open in the future,</v>

518
00:27:03.091 --> 00:27:05.550
<v Speaker 3>but we don't know what the fate of these</v>
<v Speaker 3>animals will be.</v>

519
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.480
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did this diagram to try and understand</v>

520
00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:12.990
<v Speaker 3>the overall governance of ocean use.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

521
00:27:12.991 --> 00:27:13.824
<v Speaker 3>and I know a lot about that mainly </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I've worked with some very </v>

522
00:27:15.991 --> 00:27:17.700
<v Speaker 3>interesting layers and others,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

523
00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:21.300
<v Speaker 3>people involved with fisheries </v>
<v Speaker 3>management and [inaudible] management.</v>

524
00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:25.830
<v Speaker 3>And don't worry about all the details I </v>
<v Speaker 3>find I did this diagram,</v>

525
00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:30.720
<v Speaker 3>but the year 2000 hasn't really changed </v>
<v Speaker 3>much except that now there's a,</v>

526
00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:33.810
<v Speaker 3>not just the 1992 Rio,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as was pointed out,</v>

527
00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:36.270
<v Speaker 3>we're up to 2012,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rio plus 20.</v>

528
00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:38.350
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>

529
00:27:38.351 --> 00:27:39.184
<v Speaker 3>the important point here is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever we do with the oceans now </v>

530
00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:44.413
<v Speaker 3>doesn't just involve Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't just involve a province in </v>

531
00:27:47.341 --> 00:27:49.950
<v Speaker 3>Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It involves international management,</v>

532
00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:54.000
<v Speaker 3>the use of global consensus documents </v>
<v Speaker 3>like the law of the sea.</v>

533
00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:58.860
<v Speaker 3>It involves trade in an investment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a activities of various sorts.</v>

534
00:27:58.861 --> 00:28:02.670
<v Speaker 3>And I'm going to talk about some of </v>
<v Speaker 3>these national and local interests,</v>

535
00:28:02.671 --> 00:28:07.050
<v Speaker 3>which are often very vested interest and</v>
<v Speaker 3>not in the best interest of the ocean,</v>

536
00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:08.003
<v Speaker 3>but sometimes they are and they're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>listened to and the generation of </v>

537
00:28:10.591 --> 00:28:12.010
<v Speaker 3>knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

538
00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:14.370
<v Speaker 3>which comes not just as knowledge from </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientists,</v>

539
00:28:14.371 --> 00:28:15.204
<v Speaker 3>but it comes from people that have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>flame in their belly like we heard in </v>

540
00:28:20.461 --> 00:28:22.260
<v Speaker 3>our last talk and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

541
00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:27.320
<v Speaker 3>people that are in native communities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first nations community groups,</v>

542
00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:30.270
<v Speaker 3>and many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many other interests.</v>

543
00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:33.270
<v Speaker 3>So knowledge now is drawn from many </v>
<v Speaker 3>places.</v>

544
00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:37.790
<v Speaker 3>How do we put that knowledge together?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we have things like a very,</v>

545
00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:38.933
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very good thing called the global ocean </v>

546
00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:42.870
<v Speaker 3>forum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But don't have time to go into the AE,</v>

547
00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:44.063
<v Speaker 3>but I suggest you take a look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this has become kind of a pressure </v>

548
00:28:46.741 --> 00:28:50.700
<v Speaker 3>group at the international level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you can see,</v>

549
00:28:50.701 --> 00:28:52.070
<v Speaker 3>don't worry about all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

550
00:28:52.071 --> 00:28:54.300
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of different areas and all</v>

551
00:28:54.301 --> 00:28:55.134
<v Speaker 3>of these areas relate back to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamentals of Aquatic Resource </v>

552
00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:00.683
<v Speaker 3>Management,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fisheries.</v>

553
00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:03.060
<v Speaker 3>There's also a new,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

554
00:29:03.061 --> 00:29:03.894
<v Speaker 3>yet another I hasten to add and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>know what they're going to be able to </v>

555
00:29:07.501 --> 00:29:08.334
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A global ocean commission that's been </v>

556
00:29:09.991 --> 00:29:13.890
<v Speaker 3>established launched just a few weeks </v>
<v Speaker 3>ago with a focus on the high seas.</v>

557
00:29:13.891 --> 00:29:16.150
<v Speaker 3>Those areas of the deep blue that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

558
00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:19.590
<v Speaker 3>Jordan correctly pointed out are not </v>
<v Speaker 3>necessarily all the productive areas,</v>

559
00:29:19.591 --> 00:29:23.850
<v Speaker 3>but they do play a major role still in </v>
<v Speaker 3>our use of the oceans.</v>

560
00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:26.880
<v Speaker 3>And one of the big questions is what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who should,</v>

561
00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:29.640
<v Speaker 3>how should high seas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

562
00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:33.180
<v Speaker 3>marine protected areas be set up and how</v>
<v Speaker 3>should they be managed?</v>

563
00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:36.660
<v Speaker 3>Because all those neat things like fin </v>
<v Speaker 3>tuna,</v>

564
00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:38.063
<v Speaker 3>that goal in a big circle around from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Gulf of Mexico up to east coast of </v>

565
00:29:41.621 --> 00:29:42.454
<v Speaker 3>Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 3>across the West Africa and then across </v>

566
00:29:43.861 --> 00:29:46.630
<v Speaker 3>it here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if they face a gauntlet of fisheries</v>

567
00:29:46.631 --> 00:29:47.464
<v Speaker 3>boats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a tremendous number of each of those </v>

568
00:29:49.271 --> 00:29:50.104
<v Speaker 3>fishes worth $50,000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One or two of those fish means the </v>

569
00:29:53.591 --> 00:29:57.250
<v Speaker 3>difference for Canadian fishermen </v>
<v Speaker 3>between a good year and a bad year.</v>

570
00:29:57.670 --> 00:30:00.400
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so the incentive to keep fee to have</v>

571
00:30:00.401 --> 00:30:01.234
<v Speaker 3>sustainability of the harvest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's also Japanese in the high </v>

572
00:30:03.671 --> 00:30:06.280
<v Speaker 3>seas and those people in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mediterranean side,</v>

573
00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:07.420
<v Speaker 3>et Cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's a lot of,</v>

574
00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:09.850
<v Speaker 3>some illegal fishing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>

575
00:30:09.851 --> 00:30:13.030
<v Speaker 3>Paul Martin's a Canadian number of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I wish him luck,</v>

576
00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:14.193
<v Speaker 3>but we frankly have had lots of very </v>
<v Speaker 3>good advice from global ocean </v>

577
00:30:19.121 --> 00:30:23.230
<v Speaker 3>commissions and we haven't seen the </v>
<v Speaker 3>uptake of that advice nearly as strongly</v>

578
00:30:23.231 --> 00:30:24.064
<v Speaker 3>as we should.</v>

579
00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:25.250
<v Speaker 3>And that's a troubling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

580
00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:28.270
<v Speaker 3>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm entitled the,</v>

581
00:30:28.271 --> 00:30:29.230
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Talk,</v>

582
00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:31.480
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just for the taking.</v>

583
00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:36.250
<v Speaker 3>And I really mean that the oceans are </v>
<v Speaker 3>not just there for us to take.</v>

584
00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:39.130
<v Speaker 3>We have to give,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have to give a lot.</v>

585
00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:43.960
<v Speaker 3>You have to give our best to make the </v>
<v Speaker 3>uses of the ocean sustainable.</v>

586
00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:45.273
<v Speaker 3>We have to understand that other </v>
<v Speaker 3>creatures on this planet have a strong </v>

587
00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:55.170
<v Speaker 3>rationale for being included in the list</v>
<v Speaker 3>of voters of the ocean and the people,</v>

588
00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:58.450
<v Speaker 3>the creatures that have some take on </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

589
00:30:58.530 --> 00:31:02.050
<v Speaker 3>a massive set of resources up there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

590
00:31:02.051 --> 00:31:02.884
<v Speaker 3>but for us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we at least can talk back and forth as </v>

591
00:31:04.781 --> 00:31:06.670
<v Speaker 3>humans to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

592
00:31:06.671 --> 00:31:07.660
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

593
00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:08.733
<v Speaker 3>we have to devise what I'd call a </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsible care approach for </v>

594
00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:12.593
<v Speaker 3>candidates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I'm going to go through some of </v>

595
00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:15.713
<v Speaker 3>what I consider the elements of that to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be including some of the things that </v>

596
00:31:18.461 --> 00:31:19.780
<v Speaker 3>directly relate to fisheries.</v>

597
00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:22.720
<v Speaker 3>First question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this comes from,</v>

598
00:31:22.810 --> 00:31:23.800
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>John Fraser,</v>

599
00:31:23.801 --> 00:31:28.750
<v Speaker 3>who I think a lot of former minister of </v>
<v Speaker 3>fisheries and oceans candidate who lives</v>

600
00:31:28.751 --> 00:31:30.820
<v Speaker 3>in the west coast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he talks,</v>

601
00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:32.043
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a person who is totally and </v>

602
00:31:34.961 --> 00:31:38.890
<v Speaker 3>absolutely committed to the health and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the wellbeing of the oceans and says,</v>

603
00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:42.460
<v Speaker 3>who speaks for the oceans and what are </v>
<v Speaker 3>they doing about it?</v>

604
00:31:43.030 --> 00:31:45.190
<v Speaker 3>And I think that for your group,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Finn,</v>

605
00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:46.263
<v Speaker 3>you should ask that question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should be one of the groups that </v>

606
00:31:48.851 --> 00:31:51.820
<v Speaker 3>speaking for the oceans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what are you going to do about it?</v>

607
00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:55.060
<v Speaker 3>What is it that you can do to make a </v>
<v Speaker 3>difference?</v>

608
00:31:55.210 --> 00:31:58.150
<v Speaker 3>And that question should be first and </v>
<v Speaker 3>foremost in your mind.</v>

609
00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:03.250
<v Speaker 3>Here's a couple of Canadian authors do </v>
<v Speaker 3>add to the very good list.</v>

610
00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:05.950
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that was a short list by the way,</v>

611
00:32:05.951 --> 00:32:06.370
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

612
00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:07.203
<v Speaker 3>Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

613
00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:08.860
<v Speaker 3>mentioned there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's lots of others,</v>

614
00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:10.960
<v Speaker 3>but the book's Seasick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

615
00:32:10.961 --> 00:32:13.930
<v Speaker 3>written by Ilana Mitchell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>former global mail writer.</v>

616
00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:17.650
<v Speaker 3>She put a couple of years of her life </v>
<v Speaker 3>into writing this book and it's very,</v>

617
00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:20.410
<v Speaker 3>very good and it's been highly </v>
<v Speaker 3>acclaimed.</v>

618
00:32:20.411 --> 00:32:21.820
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

619
00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:22.713
<v Speaker 3>and it's based on science,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she's not a scientist first and say </v>

620
00:32:26.181 --> 00:32:27.014
<v Speaker 3>that she's a journalist trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>explain things about the oceans and you </v>

621
00:32:29.801 --> 00:32:32.470
<v Speaker 3>can see from our title of what her </v>
<v Speaker 3>conclusion is.</v>

622
00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:34.340
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Farley Mowat,</v>

623
00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:37.660
<v Speaker 3>who's often a controversial figure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but his book,</v>

624
00:32:37.661 --> 00:32:38.494
<v Speaker 3>Sea of slaughter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll go more detail about the things </v>

625
00:32:40.521 --> 00:32:41.354
<v Speaker 3>that Jordan was talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about this unending slaughter of </v>

626
00:32:44.061 --> 00:32:47.530
<v Speaker 3>creatures from the ocean over the last </v>
<v Speaker 3>500 years in Canada.</v>

627
00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:49.033
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I once showed a film about sea of </v>

628
00:32:50.661 --> 00:32:54.700
<v Speaker 3>slaughter at Dalhousie University and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the graduate students that,</v>

629
00:32:54.701 --> 00:32:55.534
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>asked me to stop it in the middle and </v>

630
00:32:56.631 --> 00:32:57.464
<v Speaker 3>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can't take anymore if this is what </v>

631
00:32:59.601 --> 00:33:02.600
<v Speaker 3>the situation is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why are you spending your time on this?</v>

632
00:33:02.601 --> 00:33:05.150
<v Speaker 3>Why don't you just give up and try and </v>
<v Speaker 3>do something simpler?</v>

633
00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:08.060
<v Speaker 3>That's enough the way I'm constructed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess.</v>

634
00:33:08.490 --> 00:33:11.690
<v Speaker 3>But the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not pleasant greeting,</v>

635
00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:15.050
<v Speaker 3>but it's a reality check about what we </v>
<v Speaker 3>have done in the past.</v>

636
00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:19.580
<v Speaker 3>And I'd also like to pay tribute to some</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who,</v>

637
00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:20.930
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

638
00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:21.793
<v Speaker 3>Canada as a nation has produced some of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the best fisheries and ocean scientists </v>

639
00:33:25.711 --> 00:33:26.544
<v Speaker 3>in the world at one point in time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were probably with along with a few </v>

640
00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:32.040
<v Speaker 3>European countries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

641
00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:33.133
<v Speaker 3>having the best scientific journals and </v>
<v Speaker 3>so forth and paying the most attention </v>

642
00:33:37.221 --> 00:33:41.210
<v Speaker 3>in terms of free access to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>information and,</v>

643
00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:46.180
<v Speaker 3>and good research codes of ethics and </v>
<v Speaker 3>funding in,</v>

644
00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:48.370
<v Speaker 3>in the ocean sciences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

645
00:33:48.371 --> 00:33:49.204
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've only put three names up here of </v>

646
00:33:51.651 --> 00:33:55.310
<v Speaker 3>people who are involved as an ocean </v>
<v Speaker 3>studies or ocean science,</v>

647
00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:56.593
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that have regrettably passed </v>

648
00:33:57.981 --> 00:33:59.180
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

649
00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:01.550
<v Speaker 3>if they were still alive and there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>

650
00:34:01.551 --> 00:34:04.070
<v Speaker 3>many of my colleagues that I could put </v>
<v Speaker 3>up here,</v>

651
00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:07.880
<v Speaker 3>I'd be hard pressed to choose which </v>
<v Speaker 3>ones.</v>

652
00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:12.020
<v Speaker 3>But let me just give you this very brief</v>
<v Speaker 3>profile of these people ran,</v>

653
00:34:12.140 --> 00:34:16.010
<v Speaker 3>ran myers ransom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Myers worked for the government and left</v>

654
00:34:16.011 --> 00:34:18.230
<v Speaker 3>the government wanting to be more </v>
<v Speaker 3>independent,</v>

655
00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:19.363
<v Speaker 3>became a leading.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a professor at Dalhousie University </v>

656
00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:28.990
<v Speaker 3>and got a great following from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world's press because he told it like it</v>

657
00:34:30.531 --> 00:34:31.364
<v Speaker 3>was using his accurate scientific </v>
<v Speaker 3>approaches as best he could about the </v>

658
00:34:36.621 --> 00:34:37.454
<v Speaker 3>state of fisheries in various parts of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world and including those in the </v>

659
00:34:42.201 --> 00:34:44.330
<v Speaker 3>east coast of Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Elizabeth Matador,</v>

660
00:34:44.410 --> 00:34:45.243
<v Speaker 3>Gazer who many people worship around the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world and she is the daughter of Thomas </v>

661
00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:51.823
<v Speaker 3>Mann,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the great author and a wonderful person </v>

662
00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:56.690
<v Speaker 3>who gave herself over completely to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>oceans,</v>

663
00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:57.553
<v Speaker 3>also at Dalhousie University,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but head at the International Oceans </v>

664
00:35:00.650 --> 00:35:01.483
<v Speaker 3>Institute and trained and got the money </v>
<v Speaker 3>to train by hounding people like Bureau </v>

665
00:35:05.210 --> 00:35:07.640
<v Speaker 3>Trudeau and others in Canada saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>please give me money.</v>

666
00:35:07.641 --> 00:35:09.290
<v Speaker 3>And then using that money to get more </v>
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>

667
00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:10.513
<v Speaker 3>And so thousands of people now have been</v>
<v Speaker 3>trained in understanding the </v>

668
00:35:14.061 --> 00:35:16.370
<v Speaker 3>complexities of oceans because of her </v>
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>

669
00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:18.410
<v Speaker 3>She was also a great author,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

670
00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:22.190
<v Speaker 3>on the oceans as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the third person who died recently,</v>

671
00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:25.400
<v Speaker 3>who I had the good fortune to work with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who is a psychologist.</v>

672
00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:28.400
<v Speaker 3>So not all is lost for you in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>field.</v>

673
00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:32.350
<v Speaker 3>He sorted out how to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

674
00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:37.120
<v Speaker 3>reduce the damage from the interaction </v>
<v Speaker 3>between fishermen and Wales and,</v>

675
00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:37.963
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

676
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:41.430
<v Speaker 3>Newfoundland that was his first claim to</v>
<v Speaker 3>fame.</v>

677
00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:42.293
<v Speaker 3>Many more things since then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he learned how using basic </v>

678
00:35:45.691 --> 00:35:46.524
<v Speaker 3>behavioral things that involve both the </v>
<v Speaker 3>behavior of the whales and the behavior </v>

679
00:35:50.491 --> 00:35:52.140
<v Speaker 3>of the fishermen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that when whales got,</v>

680
00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:53.003
<v Speaker 3>which is very frequent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which when whales got caught in the </v>

681
00:35:55.291 --> 00:35:57.180
<v Speaker 3>fisherman's traps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we called traps.</v>

682
00:35:57.630 --> 00:35:58.620
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

683
00:35:58.650 --> 00:36:00.330
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and these are big whales,</v>

684
00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:01.640
<v Speaker 3>really big whales.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

685
00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:04.140
<v Speaker 3>and everybody got upset at the Wales,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got upset enough from,</v>

686
00:36:04.141 --> 00:36:04.974
<v Speaker 3>died fishermen put themselves in danger </v>
<v Speaker 3>but lost a great deal of money and who </v>

687
00:36:08.401 --> 00:36:09.390
<v Speaker 3>wants to kill a whale?</v>

688
00:36:09.690 --> 00:36:10.523
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he worked that out and had teams that </v>

689
00:36:12.361 --> 00:36:14.520
<v Speaker 3>could actually go out and do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

690
00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:16.380
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he did many more things.</v>

691
00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:17.410
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

692
00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:18.323
<v Speaker 3>and these are people who made a </v>
<v Speaker 3>substantial contribution in their </v>

693
00:36:21.301 --> 00:36:26.301
<v Speaker 3>lifetimes and serve as an inspiration </v>
<v Speaker 3>for me and for many others.</v>

694
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:28.890
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting down,</v>

695
00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:29.753
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just suggesting maybe if you're </v>

696
00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:32.813
<v Speaker 3>serious about wanting to understand what</v>
<v Speaker 3>we should be asking as research </v>

697
00:36:36.301 --> 00:36:37.134
<v Speaker 3>questions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's what some of the nation </v>

698
00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:43.350
<v Speaker 3>scientists in Canada and are talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

699
00:36:43.590 --> 00:36:46.200
<v Speaker 3>and they bring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they bring in these four areas.</v>

700
00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:47.483
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bray improve the fundamental scientific </v>

701
00:36:48.931 --> 00:36:49.764
<v Speaker 3>understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we've got to have the information </v>

702
00:36:51.451 --> 00:36:52.284
<v Speaker 3>about monitoring and how you use that </v>
<v Speaker 3>information and you have to look at </v>

703
00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:58.650
<v Speaker 3>really understanding the impacts of </v>
<v Speaker 3>human activities.</v>

704
00:36:59.010 --> 00:36:59.843
<v Speaker 3>And then you've got to bring this </v>
<v Speaker 3>information back into governance and </v>

705
00:37:01.801 --> 00:37:02.634
<v Speaker 3>management.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it isn't just about managing a </v>

706
00:37:04.441 --> 00:37:06.870
<v Speaker 3>specific fish stock.</v>

707
00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:10.890
<v Speaker 3>We've gone beyond that now because when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you try and do it,</v>

708
00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:15.450
<v Speaker 3>we find often it's almost impossible </v>
<v Speaker 3>because there's big questions that,</v>

709
00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:18.810
<v Speaker 3>that are ignored in that approach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

710
00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:20.820
<v Speaker 3>this is a rather interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

711
00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:21.720
<v Speaker 3>new,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

712
00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:25.310
<v Speaker 3>and document this just come out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it gets to the,</v>

713
00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:28.110
<v Speaker 3>what I'm going to try and say in some of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the things tonight.</v>

714
00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:31.280
<v Speaker 3>Then there's other people that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there's this,</v>

715
00:37:31.290 --> 00:37:35.310
<v Speaker 3>the scientific community speaks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then there's all these folks,</v>

716
00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:36.293
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

717
00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:39.030
<v Speaker 3>see pause.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Canadian parks and wilderness society.</v>

718
00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:41.820
<v Speaker 3>The Vancouver aquarium is a great place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

719
00:37:41.821 --> 00:37:43.710
<v Speaker 3>ecology action center,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nova Scotia,</v>

720
00:37:43.711 --> 00:37:45.630
<v Speaker 3>the living ocean society in the west </v>
<v Speaker 3>coast,</v>

721
00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:46.553
<v Speaker 3>wwf,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that major programs that relate back to </v>

722
00:37:48.631 --> 00:37:49.680
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

723
00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:54.030
<v Speaker 3>and I would really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really strongly underlying first nations</v>

724
00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:57.900
<v Speaker 3>and all three coast of Canada for coast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we include the maritimes,</v>

725
00:37:58.280 --> 00:37:59.113
<v Speaker 3>we include the Great Lakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have an incredibly important role </v>

726
00:38:02.461 --> 00:38:06.690
<v Speaker 3>because they have constitutional rights </v>
<v Speaker 3>that relate back to the oceans.</v>

727
00:38:07.530 --> 00:38:08.363
<v Speaker 3>So we have this opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've got the longest coastline in the </v>

728
00:38:10.861 --> 00:38:15.690
<v Speaker 3>world and our maritime estate people </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't often recognize is about,</v>

729
00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:17.610
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>depending on how you count it,</v>

730
00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:21.060
<v Speaker 3>but it could be as high as 70% of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>land area.</v>

731
00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:24.660
<v Speaker 3>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's an important figure to remember.</v>

732
00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:26.570
<v Speaker 3>And then we have this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

733
00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:27.653
<v Speaker 3>purple exclusive economic zone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which from 1977 onwards has been the </v>

734
00:38:33.151 --> 00:38:33.984
<v Speaker 3>opportunity side for Canada has been as </v>
<v Speaker 3>if we only had our hands on the </v>

735
00:38:37.571 --> 00:38:38.404
<v Speaker 3>management of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now we haven't had it for since </v>

736
00:38:40.571 --> 00:38:42.520
<v Speaker 3>1977.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We could do much better,</v>

737
00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:45.940
<v Speaker 3>get much more value from our use of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ocean.</v>

738
00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:48.220
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we could make it much more sustainable.</v>

739
00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:50.830
<v Speaker 3>Reality is sometimes been a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>different now.</v>

740
00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:51.713
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you'll allow me a little bit of a </v>

741
00:38:53.501 --> 00:38:55.600
<v Speaker 3>West Coast Navitas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

742
00:38:55.750 --> 00:39:00.550
<v Speaker 3>from coast to coast to coast to coast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we started in Vancouver,</v>

743
00:39:00.551 --> 00:39:03.780
<v Speaker 3>but the one I like here is just near my </v>
<v Speaker 3>home in Oak Bay,</v>

744
00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:05.340
<v Speaker 3>Victoria,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

745
00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:06.250
<v Speaker 3>boxing day.</v>

746
00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:11.380
<v Speaker 3>And you think of boxing day sales while </v>
<v Speaker 3>the people in and uh,</v>

747
00:39:11.530 --> 00:39:13.410
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oak Bay,</v>

748
00:39:13.411 --> 00:39:14.244
<v Speaker 3>think of sailing in a different sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>way of boxing day and they are out and </v>

749
00:39:17.711 --> 00:39:21.160
<v Speaker 3>the water in their wetsuits and their </v>
<v Speaker 3>boats with my baker in the background.</v>

750
00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:24.910
<v Speaker 3>But here's another amazing thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The western Arctic,</v>

751
00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:26.153
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that ice highway goes 40 kilometers and </v>

752
00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:30.863
<v Speaker 3>it comes up from the new vick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've traveled all along the Mackenzie </v>

753
00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:35.103
<v Speaker 3>River,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you'd go to little hamlet of </v>

754
00:39:36.490 --> 00:39:37.323
<v Speaker 3>Tuktoyaktuk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is important strategically for a </v>

755
00:39:39.191 --> 00:39:40.024
<v Speaker 3>number of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the last 40 kilometers you're </v>

756
00:39:41.891 --> 00:39:44.470
<v Speaker 3>actually traveling on the Arctic Ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the frozen ocean.</v>

757
00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:45.783
<v Speaker 3>So they've just announced this week that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are going to put in an all season </v>

758
00:39:49.451 --> 00:39:52.810
<v Speaker 3>road,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which will be $300 million.</v>

759
00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:53.883
<v Speaker 3>And of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the reasons for that is simply </v>

760
00:39:55.991 --> 00:39:58.960
<v Speaker 3>that they won't be able to use ice </v>
<v Speaker 3>highways up there much longer.</v>

761
00:39:59.190 --> 00:40:02.110
<v Speaker 3>This becomes a seasoned becomes too </v>
<v Speaker 3>short and tenuous.</v>

762
00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:03.693
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this was one of a person that I did </v>

763
00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:09.590
<v Speaker 3>a lot of mentoring with Janell Kennedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

764
00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:14.890
<v Speaker 3>on the eastern Arctic where of course </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a primary or for what's going to</v>

765
00:40:15.281 --> 00:40:18.010
<v Speaker 3>happen in the future with icebergs and </v>
<v Speaker 3>so forth.</v>

766
00:40:18.530 --> 00:40:19.363
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also one of the most interesting </v>

767
00:40:20.591 --> 00:40:21.424
<v Speaker 3>areas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

768
00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:26.080
<v Speaker 3>because we don't know very much about </v>
<v Speaker 3>the continental shelf and that area.</v>

769
00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:31.140
<v Speaker 3>Some people say it's better known on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>surface of the moon than it is on the,</v>

770
00:40:32.621 --> 00:40:34.560
<v Speaker 3>along the bottom of that area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

771
00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:35.793
<v Speaker 3>people are already looking at it though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for oil and gas exploitation for </v>

772
00:40:38.711 --> 00:40:42.340
<v Speaker 3>shipping purposes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're also looking for,</v>

773
00:40:42.341 --> 00:40:46.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm a fisheries surprising how many </v>
<v Speaker 3>things are happening in the Arctic right</v>

774
00:40:46.721 --> 00:40:49.420
<v Speaker 3>now where people want to go up and test </v>
<v Speaker 3>fish and the east coast.</v>

775
00:40:49.421 --> 00:40:51.670
<v Speaker 3>It's for things like cod and the west </v>
<v Speaker 3>coast.</v>

776
00:40:51.850 --> 00:40:52.683
<v Speaker 3>There's already salmon moving around </v>
<v Speaker 3>into all of this at Pacific salmon are </v>

777
00:40:56.951 --> 00:41:01.570
<v Speaker 3>now found in some Arctic rivers to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>other coast.</v>

778
00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:03.393
<v Speaker 3>Gander.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in a narrow small airplane with </v>

779
00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:07.420
<v Speaker 3>John Lean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the person they will,</v>

780
00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:10.210
<v Speaker 3>men Gander and Fogo island,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

781
00:41:10.310 --> 00:41:13.900
<v Speaker 3>all covered in ice at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then to a place where,</v>

782
00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:16.480
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really enjoy being,</v>

783
00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:19.920
<v Speaker 3>which is Lunenberg Nova Scotia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the great shipping,</v>

784
00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:23.020
<v Speaker 3>a wooden ship building and so forth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

785
00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:26.170
<v Speaker 3>basis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it happened to be there the day they</v>

786
00:41:26.171 --> 00:41:30.460
<v Speaker 3>were relaunching the bluenose to um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost newly built.</v>

787
00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.350
<v Speaker 3>And it's kind of interesting if you look</v>
<v Speaker 3>along that shoreline,</v>

788
00:41:33.370 --> 00:41:35.720
<v Speaker 3>there is the sea shepherd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would know the sea shepherd,</v>

789
00:41:35.721 --> 00:41:38.660
<v Speaker 3>Paul Watson's both,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which has been pounded by Canada,</v>

790
00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:40.250
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

791
00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:42.410
<v Speaker 3>for reasons that I won't explain it </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>

792
00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:44.760
<v Speaker 3>And then you can see these other large </v>
<v Speaker 3>boats.</v>

793
00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:45.673
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can see the dartmouth ferry and </v>

794
00:41:47.151 --> 00:41:49.640
<v Speaker 3>the small naval vessel and dry dock </v>
<v Speaker 3>there as well.</v>

795
00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:50.983
<v Speaker 3>It really is an active little spot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but don't forget that the oceans </v>

796
00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:58.370
<v Speaker 3>influence extends to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ontario,</v>

797
00:41:58.640 --> 00:41:59.473
<v Speaker 3>not only directly through the New </v>
<v Speaker 3>Orleans region and particularly </v>

798
00:42:04.131 --> 00:42:07.670
<v Speaker 3>therefore for Quebec,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also the water comes out of Ontario,</v>

799
00:42:07.671 --> 00:42:09.290
<v Speaker 3>the quality of the water and so forth.</v>

800
00:42:09.690 --> 00:42:10.523
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>creatures from the ocean come up into </v>

801
00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:14.840
<v Speaker 3>the Great Lakes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

802
00:42:15.470 --> 00:42:16.303
<v Speaker 3>including those El wives and some other </v>
<v Speaker 3>little things that are really nasty and </v>

803
00:42:19.431 --> 00:42:23.270
<v Speaker 3>cost us billions of dollars in </v>
<v Speaker 3>management of these species.</v>

804
00:42:23.810 --> 00:42:24.643
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

805
00:42:25.070 --> 00:42:25.903
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's also officially considered in </v>

806
00:42:27.891 --> 00:42:28.724
<v Speaker 3>Canada that these are inland seas that </v>
<v Speaker 3>deserve to fall under the purview of </v>

807
00:42:33.171 --> 00:42:34.004
<v Speaker 3>fisheries and oceans for some things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we think of the Gulf of Saint </v>

808
00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:38.023
<v Speaker 3>Lawrence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

809
00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:38.873
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a very interesting body of water </v>

810
00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:41.143
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what I'd like you to look at is </v>

811
00:42:42.561 --> 00:42:45.740
<v Speaker 3>those little circles and then I'm going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to show you some more circles.</v>

812
00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:47.053
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the most interesting things for </v>

813
00:42:48.741 --> 00:42:52.280
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've tried to simplify my understanding,</v>

814
00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:53.143
<v Speaker 3>a very complex oceanography is to look </v>
<v Speaker 3>at the things that go round and round </v>

815
00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:59.120
<v Speaker 3>and dryers and circles of one sort or </v>
<v Speaker 3>another.</v>

816
00:42:59.430 --> 00:43:00.263
<v Speaker 3>The simple example is when you go see </v>
<v Speaker 3>kayaking and you're out there straining </v>

817
00:43:02.931 --> 00:43:06.020
<v Speaker 3>against the current and so forth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe the tides against it and there's a</v>

818
00:43:06.021 --> 00:43:08.000
<v Speaker 3>strong current and maybe a wind blowing </v>
<v Speaker 3>against you.</v>

819
00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:09.433
<v Speaker 3>So you go in and shore and then you find</v>
<v Speaker 3>a countercurrent and then you're just </v>

820
00:43:13.490 --> 00:43:14.323
<v Speaker 3>swept along because that countercurrent </v>
<v Speaker 3>is going this way while the main </v>

821
00:43:16.971 --> 00:43:17.804
<v Speaker 3>currents going that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you get a free ride instead of being </v>

822
00:43:20.181 --> 00:43:23.240
<v Speaker 3>out at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So lots of other things get free rides.</v>

823
00:43:23.241 --> 00:43:24.074
<v Speaker 3>So if you look at what's called the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Haida Eddie here and see these little </v>

824
00:43:26.541 --> 00:43:29.870
<v Speaker 3>swirls out in the going out into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ocean there,</v>

825
00:43:30.350 --> 00:43:31.183
<v Speaker 3>well they're driven by the fresh water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is all that red stuff coming down </v>

826
00:43:33.921 --> 00:43:36.230
<v Speaker 3>from the rivers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the Skeena river and some others.</v>

827
00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:37.860
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>

828
00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:38.893
<v Speaker 3>those swirls are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are driven by the current patterns of </v>

829
00:43:42.051 --> 00:43:42.884
<v Speaker 3>the ocean and they go out and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>transport all the larvae from the </v>

830
00:43:46.941 --> 00:43:50.150
<v Speaker 3>insurer and the nutrients out to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>offshore.</v>

831
00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:55.180
<v Speaker 3>So you talked to Jordan about the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Simone's and one of these.</v>

832
00:43:56.091 --> 00:43:58.520
<v Speaker 3>Now Boys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sema is just out there,</v>

833
00:43:58.540 --> 00:43:59.740
<v Speaker 3>up near the top end of it.</v>

834
00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:00.750
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

835
00:44:00.990 --> 00:44:03.530
<v Speaker 3>that second set of swirls off there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

836
00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:05.220
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

837
00:44:05.330 --> 00:44:06.163
<v Speaker 3>that's how it gets all the fish that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are out there that make it very </v>

838
00:44:09.981 --> 00:44:12.830
<v Speaker 3>special and why it's a high productivity</v>
<v Speaker 3>area.</v>

839
00:44:13.310 --> 00:44:14.143
<v Speaker 3>Another one is in the beaufort gyre up </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the Arctic and that's a collection </v>

840
00:44:18.381 --> 00:44:21.500
<v Speaker 3>point for the whales in the Arctic and </v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the,</v>

841
00:44:21.501 --> 00:44:23.570
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fish species as well because of the high</v>

842
00:44:23.571 --> 00:44:26.240
<v Speaker 3>productivity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>same when the Gulf stream.</v>

843
00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:29.750
<v Speaker 3>And here's a good example of how little </v>
<v Speaker 3>we understand.</v>

844
00:44:30.350 --> 00:44:31.183
<v Speaker 3>For a long time the oceanographers </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't understand that there were these </v>

845
00:44:33.451 --> 00:44:36.810
<v Speaker 3>dryers and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that area of the Gulf stream.</v>

846
00:44:36.990 --> 00:44:39.990
<v Speaker 3>So the Gulf stream is going off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>coming up the coast of the United States</v>

847
00:44:39.991 --> 00:44:40.824
<v Speaker 3>and heading off to Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's all these counter </v>

848
00:44:42.271 --> 00:44:43.104
<v Speaker 3>currents that are swirling around just </v>
<v Speaker 3>like the ones I'd be looking for on a </v>

849
00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:46.230
<v Speaker 3>kayak.</v>

850
00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:47.063
<v Speaker 3>And then they're warm water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're drinking warm water in off the </v>

851
00:44:48.901 --> 00:44:51.270
<v Speaker 3>ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if these,</v>

852
00:44:51.370 --> 00:44:52.203
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>countercurrent is happened to be in </v>

853
00:44:54.451 --> 00:44:59.451
<v Speaker 3>place just at the time that the scallops</v>
<v Speaker 3>which are down on the Georges Bank shelf</v>

854
00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:03.620
<v Speaker 3>are spawning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the little creatures coming up,</v>

855
00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:07.920
<v Speaker 3>it gets swept away by the warm water </v>
<v Speaker 3>cause they're cold water creatures and,</v>

856
00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:09.930
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't get a good spa in that year.</v>

857
00:45:10.290 --> 00:45:12.930
<v Speaker 3>So if you're going to try and understand</v>
<v Speaker 3>the management of things,</v>

858
00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:15.660
<v Speaker 3>you have to understand phenomena like </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

859
00:45:15.661 --> 00:45:18.840
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the gyrus and the eddies and the oceans.</v>

860
00:45:19.350 --> 00:45:22.620
<v Speaker 3>And this is my first introduction here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If things,</v>

861
00:45:22.650 --> 00:45:24.300
<v Speaker 3>ecological,</v>
<v Speaker 3>physical,</v>

862
00:45:24.301 --> 00:45:25.134
<v Speaker 3>ecological phenomena that that won't </v>
<v Speaker 3>come out through an examination of </v>

863
00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:33.180
<v Speaker 3>studying fishing pressure cause their </v>
<v Speaker 3>environmental and focus.</v>

864
00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:35.490
<v Speaker 3>And there's lots of those kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 3>things in the oceans.</v>

865
00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:39.690
<v Speaker 3>So this is led to great tusks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't believe,</v>

866
00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:41.850
<v Speaker 3>it's just like among economists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

867
00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:42.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

868
00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:46.890
<v Speaker 3>what's the saying that if you get a </v>
<v Speaker 3>three economists in the room,</v>

869
00:45:46.891 --> 00:45:48.060
<v Speaker 3>you'll get four opinions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

870
00:45:48.061 --> 00:45:48.894
<v Speaker 3>or something like that.</v>

871
00:45:49.290 --> 00:45:51.480
<v Speaker 3>And it was the same is true with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fisheries biologist.</v>

872
00:45:51.481 --> 00:45:55.230
<v Speaker 3>I've actually sat in the office of an </v>
<v Speaker 3>ecological,</v>

873
00:45:55.650 --> 00:45:58.860
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ocean scientist in British Columbia.</v>

874
00:45:58.861 --> 00:46:01.230
<v Speaker 3>I just happened to be there when he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

875
00:46:01.350 --> 00:46:03.360
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is after the cod disaster.</v>

876
00:46:03.690 --> 00:46:04.523
<v Speaker 3>And he had just published a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an article with some others in science </v>

877
00:46:07.861 --> 00:46:08.694
<v Speaker 3>magazine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very highly respected Journal saying </v>

878
00:46:10.591 --> 00:46:11.424
<v Speaker 3>that the fisheries management people </v>
<v Speaker 3>basically didn't understand what they </v>

879
00:46:14.071 --> 00:46:15.100
<v Speaker 3>were doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A,</v>

880
00:46:15.210 --> 00:46:18.330
<v Speaker 3>which I agreed with him by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we were talking about that the phone</v>

881
00:46:18.331 --> 00:46:19.164
<v Speaker 3>rings just at that moment from a fishery</v>
<v Speaker 3>scientist who I won't give the name of </v>

882
00:46:22.381 --> 00:46:23.214
<v Speaker 3>an eastern Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but who worked for government and who </v>

883
00:46:24.931 --> 00:46:25.764
<v Speaker 3>was threatening to sue him for </v>
<v Speaker 3>defamation of character because they </v>

884
00:46:29.521 --> 00:46:30.990
<v Speaker 3>had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were at odds,</v>

885
00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:32.173
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were analyzing the same problem </v>

886
00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:36.053
<v Speaker 3>from entirely different points of view.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And particularly when I lived in Nova </v>

887
00:46:39.061 --> 00:46:39.894
<v Speaker 3>Scotia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could give you endless stories of </v>

888
00:46:41.611 --> 00:46:41.940
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

889
00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:43.070
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they,</v>

890
00:46:43.071 --> 00:46:44.120
<v Speaker 3>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

891
00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:45.053
<v Speaker 3>in one case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a whole very large ecosystem </v>

892
00:46:47.161 --> 00:46:47.994
<v Speaker 3>group and they were shut down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were shut down by the higher ups </v>

893
00:46:52.410 --> 00:46:53.243
<v Speaker 3>because they were producing data that </v>
<v Speaker 3>were at odds with what the population </v>

894
00:46:56.701 --> 00:46:57.534
<v Speaker 3>dynamics people were producing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm giving a simplified version of </v>

895
00:47:00.091 --> 00:47:00.770
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

896
00:47:00.770 --> 00:47:02.490
<v Speaker 3>so the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

897
00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:03.493
<v Speaker 3>and I used to say this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the students when I was teaching a </v>

898
00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:06.170
<v Speaker 3>fisheries things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

899
00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:08.040
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a Nova Scotia,</v>

900
00:47:08.670 --> 00:47:10.350
<v Speaker 3>don't trust the experts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

901
00:47:10.351 --> 00:47:11.184
<v Speaker 3>form your own opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The experts are often very wrong and </v>

902
00:47:13.921 --> 00:47:17.040
<v Speaker 3>they wear blinders just like everybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>else in society.</v>

903
00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:20.640
<v Speaker 3>And one of the biggest ones is about </v>
<v Speaker 3>fisheries management.</v>

904
00:47:21.210 --> 00:47:22.043
<v Speaker 3>Same could be said at times in the past </v>
<v Speaker 3>for forest management with fisheries </v>

905
00:47:25.261 --> 00:47:27.930
<v Speaker 3>management is inherently even more </v>
<v Speaker 3>complex.</v>

906
00:47:27.931 --> 00:47:31.270
<v Speaker 3>At least trees stand in line and can be </v>
<v Speaker 3>counted.</v>

907
00:47:31.930 --> 00:47:33.340
<v Speaker 3>Rarely is that the case with fish.</v>

908
00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:36.210
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of water kearns money,</v>

909
00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:37.840
<v Speaker 3>other things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So here's,</v>

910
00:47:37.841 --> 00:47:40.480
<v Speaker 3>here's just a little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a collection of books,</v>

911
00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:44.800
<v Speaker 3>a Nikah triple that collection about </v>
<v Speaker 3>these different points of view.</v>

912
00:47:44.830 --> 00:47:48.790
<v Speaker 3>And I won't go into details now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is a side story here.</v>

913
00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:51.160
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is in Lunenberg Nova Scotia.</v>

914
00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:53.440
<v Speaker 3>And how many have ever been to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Lunanburg?</v>

915
00:47:53.590 --> 00:47:56.200
<v Speaker 3>How many have ever been to Nova Scotia?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Great,</v>

916
00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:56.920
<v Speaker 3>great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

917
00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:59.350
<v Speaker 3>if you go down to the Lunanburg,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll see that it's very moving,</v>

918
00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:00.850
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very moving.</v>

919
00:48:00.851 --> 00:48:02.080
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

920
00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:03.610
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>set of,</v>

921
00:48:03.610 --> 00:48:04.443
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would you call these obelisks </v>

922
00:48:06.641 --> 00:48:07.480
<v Speaker 3>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess,</v>

923
00:48:08.110 --> 00:48:13.110
<v Speaker 3>and they list as much as possible the </v>
<v Speaker 3>names of people who were killed at sea.</v>

924
00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:17.560
<v Speaker 3>In some cases there might be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't have all the names because it</v>

925
00:48:17.561 --> 00:48:21.290
<v Speaker 3>would be 50 or 100 people were killed in</v>
<v Speaker 3>1927.</v>

926
00:48:21.550 --> 00:48:22.870
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>while we were living there,</v>

927
00:48:22.871 --> 00:48:26.260
<v Speaker 3>there was a terrible incident,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but these are just people from Lunenburg</v>

928
00:48:26.261 --> 00:48:30.560
<v Speaker 3>area cause this was the grand banks </v>
<v Speaker 3>fisheries and um,</v>

929
00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:31.840
<v Speaker 3>and it's very moving to see it.</v>

930
00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:33.800
<v Speaker 3>But the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

931
00:48:33.970 --> 00:48:34.803
<v Speaker 3>we remember a lot about our ocean passed</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we even tend to glorify it or feel </v>

932
00:48:38.741 --> 00:48:41.920
<v Speaker 3>sad about it or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what have we actually learned,</v>

933
00:48:42.010 --> 00:48:42.843
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's a just a little window </v>

934
00:48:44.561 --> 00:48:45.394
<v Speaker 3>dressing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is couple of postage stamps to </v>

935
00:48:46.931 --> 00:48:50.320
<v Speaker 3>remind us about the glorious past.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's the,</v>

936
00:48:50.321 --> 00:48:52.430
<v Speaker 3>I'm a fellow on the right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

937
00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:56.050
<v Speaker 3>Angus Walters was a very famous captain </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the fastest of the,</v>

938
00:48:56.051 --> 00:48:57.010
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the ships,</v>

939
00:48:57.011 --> 00:49:01.210
<v Speaker 3>the bluenose Newfoundland.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's that abundant cod population.</v>

940
00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:06.840
<v Speaker 3>But the interesting thing is the man </v>
<v Speaker 3>that told us early on stuff let is still</v>

941
00:49:07.481 --> 00:49:10.100
<v Speaker 3>being quoted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is Harold in this,</v>

942
00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:11.680
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the University of Toronto,</v>

943
00:49:12.550 --> 00:49:13.383
<v Speaker 3>who was an economist who dealt with this</v>
<v Speaker 3>idea of heartland and hinterland in </v>

944
00:49:17.470 --> 00:49:20.500
<v Speaker 3>Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the fact that we were hewers of wood</v>

945
00:49:20.590 --> 00:49:23.470
<v Speaker 3>drawers of water for traders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also,</v>

946
00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:24.353
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we dipped into the emotion and he wrote </v>

947
00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:31.120
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happens when you get a really,</v>

948
00:49:31.121 --> 00:49:34.190
<v Speaker 3>truly abundant resource like the cod </v>
<v Speaker 3>fishery?</v>

949
00:49:34.190 --> 00:49:35.023
<v Speaker 3>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

950
00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:39.100
<v Speaker 3>that's his book written in 1940,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very prescient.</v>

951
00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:42.780
<v Speaker 3>And basically he's saying as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

952
00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:46.990
<v Speaker 3>an abundant tradable resource can fuel </v>
<v Speaker 3>and economy,</v>

953
00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:49.920
<v Speaker 3>but it also traps you in many ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

954
00:49:49.921 --> 00:49:52.900
<v Speaker 3>and that is what has happened in Canada </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a sense.</v>

955
00:49:52.901 --> 00:49:53.734
<v Speaker 3>We've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've relied on super abundant natural </v>

956
00:49:55.991 --> 00:49:57.160
<v Speaker 3>resources,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just fish,</v>

957
00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:58.760
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it,</v>

958
00:49:58.761 --> 00:49:59.594
<v Speaker 3>it allows us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought a lot about this over the </v>

959
00:50:01.210 --> 00:50:02.043
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to understand why we behave </v>

960
00:50:03.130 --> 00:50:05.500
<v Speaker 3>towards the resources we do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like for example,</v>

961
00:50:05.501 --> 00:50:07.720
<v Speaker 3>with a cod,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we lived in Nova Scotia,</v>

962
00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:10.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'd go in and buy this fish.</v>

963
00:50:10.590 --> 00:50:11.790
<v Speaker 3>There was awful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

964
00:50:12.010 --> 00:50:14.740
<v Speaker 3>in the stores.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You couldn't get good cod in the stores.</v>

965
00:50:15.310 --> 00:50:18.550
<v Speaker 3>And the reason it wasn't good was </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it was mishandled,</v>

966
00:50:18.700 --> 00:50:20.590
<v Speaker 3>right from the time it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't nice,</v>

967
00:50:21.010 --> 00:50:25.120
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't bled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you'd have a nice open flesh and uh,</v>

968
00:50:25.140 --> 00:50:25.973
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was treated as if it was going off </v>

969
00:50:27.100 --> 00:50:28.150
<v Speaker 3>the care where else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

970
00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:30.230
<v Speaker 3>to be treated a salted cod,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

971
00:50:30.231 --> 00:50:31.610
<v Speaker 3>low value commodity.</v>

972
00:50:32.450 --> 00:50:33.890
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some other people,</v>

973
00:50:33.891 --> 00:50:34.724
<v Speaker 3>Icelanders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Norwegians and some others didn't do </v>

974
00:50:36.201 --> 00:50:37.670
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They treated the fish property,</v>

975
00:50:37.671 --> 00:50:38.504
<v Speaker 3>they got a very good value added and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they started respecting the resource </v>

976
00:50:42.281 --> 00:50:43.114
<v Speaker 3>base even more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's the important thing for those </v>

977
00:50:46.641 --> 00:50:49.910
<v Speaker 3>with an economic bent to recognize is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you can,</v>

978
00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:53.210
<v Speaker 3>one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the ways in which we can actually</v>

979
00:50:53.211 --> 00:50:56.600
<v Speaker 3>get more out of our resource get is to </v>
<v Speaker 3>add value to it,</v>

980
00:50:56.780 --> 00:51:00.350
<v Speaker 3>handle it carefully,</v>
<v Speaker 3>respect each fish that we catch,</v>

981
00:51:00.730 --> 00:51:05.730
<v Speaker 3>which gets again into why is it that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>can go in and use trawlers and take that</v>

982
00:51:05.981 --> 00:51:08.600
<v Speaker 3>small fraction of the fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But anyways,</v>

983
00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:10.460
<v Speaker 3>a lot of this stuff goes back to harold </v>
<v Speaker 3>in us.</v>

984
00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:14.060
<v Speaker 3>And now the other thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I hear I differ a bit from what,</v>

985
00:51:14.061 --> 00:51:16.180
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was said about the,</v>

986
00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:17.510
<v Speaker 3>the empty oceans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

987
00:51:17.511 --> 00:51:18.344
<v Speaker 3>the oceans are empty because we've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've knocked out a lot of the food </v>

988
00:51:20.841 --> 00:51:23.480
<v Speaker 3>chain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there still can be an abundance.</v>

989
00:51:23.660 --> 00:51:25.390
<v Speaker 3>And as you correctly pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

990
00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:28.190
<v Speaker 3>Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you like eating a jellyfish,</v>

991
00:51:28.191 --> 00:51:29.024
<v Speaker 3>which I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do there and I keep asking my Chinese </v>

992
00:51:33.651 --> 00:51:35.060
<v Speaker 3>colleagues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

993
00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:36.073
<v Speaker 3>well why is it that you eat a chicken </v>
<v Speaker 3>feed or certain other things with some </v>

994
00:51:40.461 --> 00:51:41.900
<v Speaker 3>of the certain other things?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

995
00:51:41.901 --> 00:51:43.490
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't for the taste,</v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly,</v>

996
00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:47.810
<v Speaker 3>it's for the crunch and crunch feller </v>
<v Speaker 3>and jellyfishes one of those things.</v>

997
00:51:48.410 --> 00:51:50.150
<v Speaker 3>And the same with Indonesians and </v>
<v Speaker 3>others.</v>

998
00:51:50.330 --> 00:51:52.310
<v Speaker 3>They liked the crunch and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>delicious.</v>

999
00:51:52.550 --> 00:51:53.383
<v Speaker 3>Now they're dried in Newfoundland.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Newfoundland couldn't believe it's good </v>

1000
00:51:55.461 --> 00:51:56.294
<v Speaker 3>luck when they discovered the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were actually people in the world that </v>

1001
00:51:57.891 --> 00:52:00.530
<v Speaker 3>want to do eat jellyfish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

1002
00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:01.633
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they started drying them and </v>

1003
00:52:02.331 --> 00:52:04.130
<v Speaker 3>exporting them into at least a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>flat patties,</v>

1004
00:52:04.131 --> 00:52:04.964
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's certain other things that I </v>

1005
00:52:06.801 --> 00:52:08.450
<v Speaker 3>could mention as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Squid.</v>

1006
00:52:08.770 --> 00:52:10.100
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course it's one of them.</v>

1007
00:52:10.340 --> 00:52:13.400
<v Speaker 3>And so what you find is a notion that </v>
<v Speaker 3>gets,</v>

1008
00:52:13.830 --> 00:52:14.663
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very abundant in those creatures that </v>

1009
00:52:17.181 --> 00:52:19.790
<v Speaker 3>can be low on the food chain often and </v>
<v Speaker 3>what we call it,</v>

1010
00:52:19.791 --> 00:52:21.030
<v Speaker 3>the tritus food chains.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1011
00:52:21.031 --> 00:52:22.940
<v Speaker 3>the stuff that rains down into the water</v>
<v Speaker 3>column.</v>

1012
00:52:23.210 --> 00:52:27.890
<v Speaker 3>So lots of fishermen are now happy to </v>
<v Speaker 3>see no cod and Nova and a,</v>

1013
00:52:28.070 --> 00:52:29.720
<v Speaker 3>well now I don't know about Nova Scotia </v>
<v Speaker 3>so much,</v>

1014
00:52:29.721 --> 00:52:31.490
<v Speaker 3>but certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoops,</v>

1015
00:52:31.850 --> 00:52:35.720
<v Speaker 3>everything shut off of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess if you've got it still,</v>

1016
00:52:35.740 --> 00:52:36.573
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have,</v>

1017
00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:38.773
<v Speaker 3>can I ask some technical help up here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I've got nothing on my screen and </v>

1018
00:52:42.310 --> 00:52:43.520
<v Speaker 3>then really like seeing the screen.</v>

1019
00:52:45.890 --> 00:52:46.723
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's okay.</v>

1020
00:52:46.730 --> 00:52:47.600
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Talk to her.</v>

1021
00:52:47.650 --> 00:52:48.483
<v Speaker 3>It's just okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then how do I get it to go back </v>

1022
00:52:51.561 --> 00:52:53.790
<v Speaker 3>here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1023
00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:56.120
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we now have very,</v>

1024
00:52:56.121 --> 00:52:56.954
<v Speaker 3>very valuable snow crowd in northern </v>
<v Speaker 3>shrimp and basically the ecosystem has </v>

1025
00:53:01.461 --> 00:53:04.490
<v Speaker 3>changed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't expect the car to come back unless</v>

1026
00:53:04.491 --> 00:53:07.790
<v Speaker 3>something catastrophic happens to these </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys because these are replaced,</v>

1027
00:53:07.791 --> 00:53:11.840
<v Speaker 3>basically replaced the card.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll see card for sure.</v>

1028
00:53:12.050 --> 00:53:12.883
<v Speaker 3>We'll see some other groundfish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we probably won't see them in the </v>

1029
00:53:14.511 --> 00:53:16.880
<v Speaker 3>abundance because these guys are eating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the food train now.</v>

1030
00:53:17.630 --> 00:53:18.620
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1031
00:53:18.750 --> 00:53:20.780
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not necessarily a bad thing,</v>

1032
00:53:21.230 --> 00:53:22.063
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there's fewer card if you're asked </v>

1033
00:53:23.901 --> 00:53:24.734
<v Speaker 3>the fishermen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of them have made it a lot of </v>

1034
00:53:25.861 --> 00:53:27.810
<v Speaker 3>money off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These new species will say,</v>

1035
00:53:27.811 --> 00:53:29.130
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're making more money,</v>

1036
00:53:29.131 --> 00:53:30.360
<v Speaker 3>we've got better votes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>et Cetera.</v>

1037
00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:33.900
<v Speaker 3>The question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I've tried to look at this question,</v>

1038
00:53:33.901 --> 00:53:35.880
<v Speaker 3>but some people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the auditor general's office,</v>

1039
00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:36.823
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some years ago and we concluded that </v>

1040
00:53:39.361 --> 00:53:40.194
<v Speaker 3>there was no knowledge base to support </v>
<v Speaker 3>the hypothesis that these actually were </v>

1041
00:53:44.071 --> 00:53:46.140
<v Speaker 3>being sustainably harvest and the new </v>
<v Speaker 3>ones.</v>

1042
00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:48.400
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we might end up with the same problem,</v>

1043
00:53:49.230 --> 00:53:52.620
<v Speaker 3>but let's go back again to what a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another thing that was mentioned earlier</v>

1044
00:53:52.950 --> 00:53:55.530
<v Speaker 3>and that is electronic gear and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>forth.</v>

1045
00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:57.450
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not exactly new,</v>

1046
00:53:57.451 --> 00:54:00.180
<v Speaker 3>but it's in this period from about 1970 </v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

1047
00:54:00.510 --> 00:54:02.200
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this man got a,</v>

1048
00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:05.880
<v Speaker 3>an honorary doctorate from I think the </v>
<v Speaker 3>University of New Brunswick.</v>

1049
00:54:06.450 --> 00:54:07.283
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this oddly enough was one of his </v>

1050
00:54:10.231 --> 00:54:12.930
<v Speaker 3>boats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I have in the sea and the dry dock</v>

1051
00:54:12.931 --> 00:54:14.580
<v Speaker 3>in Lunenburg.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1052
00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:15.511
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1053
00:54:15.511 --> 00:54:16.344
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Captain Medford Matthews was a real </v>

1054
00:54:18.181 --> 00:54:20.640
<v Speaker 3>innovator with gear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he brought in and saw,</v>

1055
00:54:20.641 --> 00:54:24.690
<v Speaker 3>this wasn't the first trawler that came </v>
<v Speaker 3>by any means into the region.</v>

1056
00:54:24.900 --> 00:54:25.501
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

1057
00:54:25.501 --> 00:54:27.540
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of like the early brand of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1058
00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:28.770
<v Speaker 3>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1059
00:54:28.770 --> 00:54:33.180
<v Speaker 3>trawlers that are of a modern type and </v>
<v Speaker 3>well equipped with all the gear that can</v>

1060
00:54:33.181 --> 00:54:36.090
<v Speaker 3>take a lot of fish soner things and </v>
<v Speaker 3>other equipment.</v>

1061
00:54:36.570 --> 00:54:37.590
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's what they look like.</v>

1062
00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:38.433
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's another one with a couple of </v>

1063
00:54:40.591 --> 00:54:41.424
<v Speaker 3>kayakers for scale.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And these things are essentially the </v>

1064
00:54:43.831 --> 00:54:47.200
<v Speaker 3>bulldozers of the sea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

1065
00:54:47.201 --> 00:54:49.530
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they do so much damage to the bottom.</v>

1066
00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:51.113
<v Speaker 3>They rip things up and I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>eventually probably will see these </v>

1067
00:54:55.741 --> 00:54:58.200
<v Speaker 3>things phased out for other types of </v>
<v Speaker 3>gear.</v>

1068
00:54:58.201 --> 00:55:02.130
<v Speaker 3>That's my hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in the interim,</v>

1069
00:55:02.490 --> 00:55:03.323
<v Speaker 3>these are deadly machines for from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>point of view of what they can hold for </v>

1070
00:55:06.061 --> 00:55:06.894
<v Speaker 3>fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean that they can't be made </v>

1071
00:55:09.961 --> 00:55:14.430
<v Speaker 3>to be useful contributors towards </v>
<v Speaker 3>sustainability if they're held in check.</v>

1072
00:55:14.970 --> 00:55:15.803
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1073
00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:17.633
<v Speaker 3>particularly when you get in these big </v>
<v Speaker 3>vessels and then you'd get a facilities </v>

1074
00:55:22.051 --> 00:55:25.830
<v Speaker 3>on them or factory boats that can </v>
<v Speaker 3>accompany them,</v>

1075
00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:27.113
<v Speaker 3>that can take an immense amount and stay</v>
<v Speaker 3>at sea for long periods of time because </v>

1076
00:55:31.291 --> 00:55:35.640
<v Speaker 3>they can devastate a whole region of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ocean very quickly.</v>

1077
00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:37.553
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then we move to what happens to fish </v>

1078
00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:42.840
<v Speaker 3>after it gets caught.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1079
00:55:44.190 --> 00:55:48.630
<v Speaker 3>if you look at this plant at the top,</v>
<v Speaker 3>national seafoods,</v>

1080
00:55:48.730 --> 00:55:52.530
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the worlds one of the world's major,</v>

1081
00:55:52.531 --> 00:55:54.360
<v Speaker 3>a fishing companies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1082
00:55:54.450 --> 00:55:55.283
<v Speaker 3>and one of the largest ones in candidate</v>
<v Speaker 3>this plant located in Lunanburg was the </v>

1083
00:55:59.071 --> 00:56:02.130
<v Speaker 3>world's largest fish plant in the 1980s.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1084
00:56:02.190 --> 00:56:05.430
<v Speaker 3>my daughter Laura,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will quite well remember when we used to</v>

1085
00:56:05.431 --> 00:56:08.880
<v Speaker 3>go down to the cottage some days we were</v>
<v Speaker 3>down in window of this,</v>

1086
00:56:08.881 --> 00:56:09.960
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1087
00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:10.711
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1088
00:56:10.711 --> 00:56:11.544
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a plant and it was just a bad smell and </v>

1089
00:56:13.921 --> 00:56:15.350
<v Speaker 3>they were taking all the remains of </v>
<v Speaker 3>making,</v>

1090
00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:17.910
<v Speaker 3>cooking it to make it into fish meal and</v>
<v Speaker 3>selling it.</v>

1091
00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:22.200
<v Speaker 3>But what does national seafood do now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1092
00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:27.130
<v Speaker 3>white fleshed fish such as cod,</v>
<v Speaker 3>haddock,</v>

1093
00:56:28.390 --> 00:56:29.223
<v Speaker 3>pollack,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a bunch of others are kind of what </v>

1094
00:56:31.660 --> 00:56:34.000
<v Speaker 3>some people in the banking business </v>
<v Speaker 3>would call fungible.</v>

1095
00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:37.600
<v Speaker 3>I either all you can exchange them </v>
<v Speaker 3>interchangeably.</v>

1096
00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:39.100
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're white flash,</v>

1097
00:56:39.101 --> 00:56:39.934
<v Speaker 3>we can make them a deficient chips.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can even take something like </v>

1098
00:56:41.441 --> 00:56:42.920
<v Speaker 3>Tilapia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1099
00:56:42.940 --> 00:56:45.520
<v Speaker 3>which is a freshwater fish and call it </v>
<v Speaker 3>cod.</v>

1100
00:56:46.060 --> 00:56:48.580
<v Speaker 3>And that happens sometimes illegally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it happens.</v>

1101
00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:49.953
<v Speaker 3>So in today's market supply chain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because China has become the most </v>

1102
00:56:53.021 --> 00:56:56.080
<v Speaker 3>efficient processor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get all this fish go into China and</v>

1103
00:56:56.081 --> 00:56:58.960
<v Speaker 3>it goes through big ports like Rotterdam</v>
<v Speaker 3>where it gets all muddled up.</v>

1104
00:56:58.961 --> 00:57:01.720
<v Speaker 3>It could come from west Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could come from southern America,</v>

1105
00:57:01.721 --> 00:57:06.721
<v Speaker 3>whatever gets turned into chunks of fish</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are partially processed there.</v>

1106
00:57:09.070 --> 00:57:09.903
<v Speaker 3>Then it comes back to companies like the</v>
<v Speaker 3>one in Lunanburg where people squirt </v>

1107
00:57:14.741 --> 00:57:15.574
<v Speaker 3>some nice things on top of it and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>make it a little fancier and make it </v>

1108
00:57:17.921 --> 00:57:19.720
<v Speaker 3>into a frozen dinner or something like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1109
00:57:20.140 --> 00:57:20.973
<v Speaker 3>Then it gets step made in Canada and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then sent to the United States are </v>

1110
00:57:23.951 --> 00:57:26.050
<v Speaker 3>consumed in Canada or maybe in Europe </v>
<v Speaker 3>even.</v>

1111
00:57:26.620 --> 00:57:27.490
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's,</v>

1112
00:57:27.491 --> 00:57:28.324
<v Speaker 3>that's a reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you were listening to the radio </v>

1113
00:57:30.101 --> 00:57:30.934
<v Speaker 3>and the last few weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's been a release of a report that </v>

1114
00:57:33.461 --> 00:57:38.461
<v Speaker 3>estimates that something like 30% of </v>
<v Speaker 3>this fish is actually mislabeled because</v>

1115
00:57:39.071 --> 00:57:39.904
<v Speaker 3>once it gets to Rotterdam or wherever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't know whether it's a card or </v>

1116
00:57:42.221 --> 00:57:43.054
<v Speaker 3>whatever it happens to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So market supply chains go through this </v>

1117
00:57:45.971 --> 00:57:46.804
<v Speaker 3>complex thing and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it makes it very difficult for us to </v>

1118
00:57:50.501 --> 00:57:51.334
<v Speaker 3>know a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether we're really eating what we </v>

1119
00:57:53.441 --> 00:57:55.510
<v Speaker 3>think is caught or whatever else it </v>
<v Speaker 3>might be.</v>

1120
00:57:55.810 --> 00:57:58.360
<v Speaker 3>B,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it was caught sustainably,</v>

1121
00:57:58.610 --> 00:57:59.443
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or even whether it went through some </v>

1122
00:58:01.811 --> 00:58:02.870
<v Speaker 3>mission happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

1123
00:58:03.260 --> 00:58:06.730
<v Speaker 3>and it's a process that lowered the </v>
<v Speaker 3>quality of the fish.</v>

1124
00:58:07.120 --> 00:58:09.790
<v Speaker 3>So this has become a major,</v>
<v Speaker 3>major problem,</v>

1125
00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:10.630
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1126
00:58:10.630 --> 00:58:11.463
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1127
00:58:11.470 --> 00:58:14.590
<v Speaker 3>ocean management and in management of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the seafood chains,</v>

1128
00:58:14.591 --> 00:58:16.030
<v Speaker 3>the sort of thing that you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

1129
00:58:16.030 --> 00:58:19.690
<v Speaker 3>If you want to be a good citizen and </v>
<v Speaker 3>only eats sustainably produced fish.</v>

1130
00:58:20.380 --> 00:58:22.000
<v Speaker 3>Fortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are solutions.</v>

1131
00:58:22.610 --> 00:58:23.443
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just to give you another example of </v>

1132
00:58:25.781 --> 00:58:26.770
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1133
00:58:26.771 --> 00:58:31.090
<v Speaker 3>and this is an area where Australia was </v>
<v Speaker 3>furious with us.</v>

1134
00:58:31.420 --> 00:58:32.830
<v Speaker 3>See these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this large fish,</v>

1135
00:58:32.831 --> 00:58:36.340
<v Speaker 3>the Patagonian toothfish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which some of you may have eaten us.</v>

1136
00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:38.440
<v Speaker 3>How many people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I shouldn't ask the question,</v>

1137
00:58:38.470 --> 00:58:42.130
<v Speaker 3>but if you want to raise your hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have you ever eaten Chilean Sea Bass?</v>

1138
00:58:43.210 --> 00:58:43.930
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1139
00:58:43.930 --> 00:58:44.763
<v Speaker 3>Chilean sea bass is one of those fancy </v>
<v Speaker 3>names that's given for something that's </v>

1140
00:58:48.101 --> 00:58:48.934
<v Speaker 3>actually a fish coming from Antarctica.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And for the most part unsustainably </v>

1141
00:58:53.201 --> 00:58:55.420
<v Speaker 3>produced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And at one point in time,</v>

1142
00:58:55.421 --> 00:58:57.640
<v Speaker 3>this has been cleaned up quite a bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>

1143
00:58:57.641 --> 00:59:01.150
<v Speaker 3>but it was going from Antarctica,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1144
00:59:01.151 --> 00:59:03.780
<v Speaker 3>an pretty much an unregulated fishery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1145
00:59:03.790 --> 00:59:06.900
<v Speaker 3>even though the Australians were really </v>
<v Speaker 3>making a pitch for it and,</v>

1146
00:59:06.970 --> 00:59:10.540
<v Speaker 3>and then he would go to China,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would be handled there,</v>

1147
00:59:10.660 --> 00:59:11.493
<v Speaker 3>then it would come to Canada and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>it'd be try and shipped to the United </v>

1148
00:59:14.170 --> 00:59:15.520
<v Speaker 3>States as Canadian fish.</v>

1149
00:59:16.210 --> 00:59:17.650
<v Speaker 3>Australians weren't very happy about </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1150
00:59:17.651 --> 00:59:19.000
<v Speaker 3>I can tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1151
00:59:19.030 --> 00:59:20.200
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but again,</v>

1152
00:59:20.201 --> 00:59:21.034
<v Speaker 3>this just illustrates things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So one of the ways to get around us is </v>

1153
00:59:24.591 --> 00:59:28.760
<v Speaker 3>through all these various choices that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can make and people that help you to</v>

1154
00:59:28.761 --> 00:59:29.594
<v Speaker 3>make good choices.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It started with the Monterey Bay </v>

1155
00:59:31.101 --> 00:59:34.580
<v Speaker 3>aquarium and now the Vancouver aquarium </v>
<v Speaker 3>is in their seafood watch.</v>

1156
00:59:35.110 --> 00:59:35.943
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most critical thing is something </v>

1157
00:59:36.921 --> 00:59:40.100
<v Speaker 3>started by wwf and some others in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>private sector,</v>

1158
00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:41.380
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the,</v>

1159
00:59:41.420 --> 00:59:43.130
<v Speaker 3>what's called the Marine Stewardship </v>
<v Speaker 3>Council,</v>

1160
00:59:43.250 --> 00:59:44.083
<v Speaker 3>which is now certifying some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some species of fish and interestingly </v>

1161
00:59:48.650 --> 00:59:49.483
<v Speaker 3>many chefs now in the world will refuse </v>
<v Speaker 3>even in countries and places like Hong </v>

1162
00:59:54.020 --> 00:59:57.440
<v Speaker 3>Kong and some of the big hotels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they will refuse to handle fish that are</v>

1163
00:59:57.441 --> 00:59:58.274
<v Speaker 3>not certified.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is a real step forward and I </v>

1164
01:00:01.971 --> 01:00:04.430
<v Speaker 3>could tell you some interesting stories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'd better move on.</v>

1165
01:00:04.610 --> 01:00:05.443
<v Speaker 3>So just go to a fish choice.com</v>
<v Speaker 3>and take a look at some of the things </v>

1166
01:00:09.561 --> 01:00:12.020
<v Speaker 3>that are on there or any of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>individual websites.</v>

1167
01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:13.393
<v Speaker 3>This is the future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a future that responsible </v>

1168
01:00:16.910 --> 01:00:20.090
<v Speaker 3>seafood companies like national see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see us,</v>

1169
01:00:20.091 --> 01:00:20.924
<v Speaker 3>what they would be faced with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of us and countries like China are </v>

1170
01:00:23.061 --> 01:00:26.210
<v Speaker 3>now starting to recognize that they will</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to become involved.</v>

1171
01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:30.170
<v Speaker 3>Then there are some of the really nasty </v>
<v Speaker 3>things like a shark's fin.</v>

1172
01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:32.600
<v Speaker 3>I took this picture in a Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 3>restaurant.</v>

1173
01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:35.250
<v Speaker 3>But the interesting thing there is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1174
01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:38.570
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] the guy who was so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so tall,</v>

1175
01:00:38.571 --> 01:00:39.404
<v Speaker 3>and he reaches to this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a basketball player from China and </v>

1176
01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:43.233
<v Speaker 3>respected,</v>
<v Speaker 3>highly respected within China and a </v>

1177
01:00:45.651 --> 01:00:46.484
<v Speaker 3>person who doesn't just play basketball,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's very interested in public </v>

1178
01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:50.260
<v Speaker 3>policy issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1179
01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:55.780
<v Speaker 3>and he came out and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will not have my wife to be and I will</v>

1180
01:00:57.351 --> 01:00:58.860
<v Speaker 3>not have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1181
01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:03.200
<v Speaker 3>shark fin soup served as it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>traditionally done at Chinese weddings.</v>

1182
01:01:03.770 --> 01:01:07.460
<v Speaker 3>And I'm going to encourage all my fellow</v>
<v Speaker 3>basketball players in sports figures and</v>

1183
01:01:07.461 --> 01:01:08.990
<v Speaker 3>so forth to do the same.</v>

1184
01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:14.380
<v Speaker 3>He's probably had more impact than any </v>
<v Speaker 3>other single thing of the scientists and</v>

1185
01:01:14.691 --> 01:01:15.524
<v Speaker 3>others who bring their hands because </v>
<v Speaker 3>China is a primary place now for shark </v>

1186
01:01:18.831 --> 01:01:23.831
<v Speaker 3>fin soup and where all those 70 million </v>
<v Speaker 3>or more shark fins are going now.</v>

1187
01:01:25.790 --> 01:01:28.580
<v Speaker 3>Little known facts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the facts,</v>

1188
01:01:29.390 --> 01:01:30.223
<v Speaker 3>but it's always interested me in Nova </v>
<v Speaker 3>Scotia that there's been a sort of </v>

1189
01:01:33.081 --> 01:01:35.150
<v Speaker 3>fishery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you go back far enough,</v>

1190
01:01:35.151 --> 01:01:35.984
<v Speaker 3>there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was all sorts of books written by </v>

1191
01:01:37.131 --> 01:01:39.200
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Zane gray type of books.</v>

1192
01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:40.473
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very rich people used to go to Nova </v>

1193
01:01:42.410 --> 01:01:45.950
<v Speaker 3>Scotia and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and catch them off as a sport fishery.</v>

1194
01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:49.400
<v Speaker 3>But in the 1940s,</v>
<v Speaker 3>still even,</v>

1195
01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:50.121
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was,</v>

1196
01:01:50.121 --> 01:01:50.954
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1197
01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:55.820
<v Speaker 3>a harpoon sort fishery in glace bay up </v>
<v Speaker 3>in Cape Breton Island,</v>

1198
01:01:56.090 --> 01:01:59.210
<v Speaker 3>hundreds and hundreds of boats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is just one picture from the,</v>

1199
01:01:59.211 --> 01:02:01.610
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the era.</v>

1200
01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:02.833
<v Speaker 3>And they had these canoes that they went</v>
<v Speaker 3>out in and men would go out there with </v>

1201
01:02:05.511 --> 01:02:09.230
<v Speaker 3>Harpoon waiting to catch up 400 or more </v>
<v Speaker 3>phone swordfish.</v>

1202
01:02:10.070 --> 01:02:12.920
<v Speaker 3>The interesting point about it is it </v>
<v Speaker 3>still exists,</v>

1203
01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:14.353
<v Speaker 3>and one of the points right now is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the marine stewardship council has been </v>

1204
01:02:18.081 --> 01:02:22.380
<v Speaker 3>asked to certify harpooned fisheries in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the United States and in Canada.</v>

1205
01:02:22.930 --> 01:02:26.340
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then also the pelagic longline.</v>

1206
01:02:26.341 --> 01:02:28.790
<v Speaker 3>Now you've got introduced to the long </v>
<v Speaker 3>line and,</v>

1207
01:02:28.870 --> 01:02:32.700
<v Speaker 3>and some people wrap their hands to put </v>
<v Speaker 3>their hands to their heart and say,</v>

1208
01:02:32.701 --> 01:02:36.210
<v Speaker 3>the long line is the way to go because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not involving those trawlers.</v>

1209
01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:39.030
<v Speaker 3>But with the long line does is catches </v>
<v Speaker 3>turtles,</v>

1210
01:02:39.031 --> 01:02:42.240
<v Speaker 3>sharks and all sorts of other things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are not the ones that species,</v>

1211
01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:43.473
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the same time as they're catching </v>

1212
01:02:44.581 --> 01:02:45.550
<v Speaker 3>swordfish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1213
01:02:46.050 --> 01:02:46.620
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1214
01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:48.270
<v Speaker 3>controversially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1215
01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:52.740
<v Speaker 3>the Marine Stewardship Council has </v>
<v Speaker 3>awarded the Northwest Atlantic Canadians</v>

1216
01:02:53.090 --> 01:02:56.910
<v Speaker 3>sort of fishery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which amongst about $10 million a year,</v>

1217
01:02:57.350 --> 01:02:58.510
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1218
01:02:58.590 --> 01:03:00.780
<v Speaker 3>certification that they were doing it </v>
<v Speaker 3>properly.</v>

1219
01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:02.130
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not so sure.</v>

1220
01:03:02.190 --> 01:03:03.840
<v Speaker 3>I don't know now this one.</v>

1221
01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:04.733
<v Speaker 3>But the interesting thing is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>already awarded the spirit fishery for </v>

1222
01:03:10.981 --> 01:03:12.090
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>

1223
01:03:12.091 --> 01:03:12.924
<v Speaker 3>the yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the spear of fishery for the swordfish </v>

1224
01:03:15.031 --> 01:03:16.030
<v Speaker 3>re,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1225
01:03:16.110 --> 01:03:18.420
<v Speaker 3>they're still using spirits out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you go,</v>

1226
01:03:18.570 --> 01:03:21.030
<v Speaker 3>if you're google something along those </v>
<v Speaker 3>lines,</v>

1227
01:03:21.031 --> 01:03:24.450
<v Speaker 3>you can actually see little things for </v>
<v Speaker 3>sportsmen in the United States.</v>

1228
01:03:24.451 --> 01:03:27.550
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>going out and votes and throwing this or</v>

1229
01:03:27.570 --> 01:03:32.570
<v Speaker 3>harpoons at getting swordfish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you can see what happens that uh,</v>

1230
01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:34.023
<v Speaker 3>the government in the late nineties </v>
<v Speaker 3>really put a clamp on things cause you </v>

1231
01:03:36.541 --> 01:03:40.770
<v Speaker 3>could see the decline on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the sort of fish going down there and</v>

1232
01:03:40.771 --> 01:03:44.850
<v Speaker 3>what below what is considered a maximum </v>
<v Speaker 3>sustainable yield of biomass.</v>

1233
01:03:45.390 --> 01:03:48.810
<v Speaker 3>And you can see as the consequences of </v>
<v Speaker 3>stopping that fishery,</v>

1234
01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:49.673
<v Speaker 3>how it's built up to the point now where</v>
<v Speaker 3>they feel that they can re-institute </v>

1235
01:03:53.350 --> 01:03:56.340
<v Speaker 3>illimited sort of fishery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So these are the sorts of things.</v>

1236
01:03:56.340 --> 01:03:58.110
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is an odd ball little example.</v>

1237
01:03:58.140 --> 01:04:00.990
<v Speaker 3>It's not one of the great fisheries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's dozens,</v>

1238
01:04:01.020 --> 01:04:01.853
<v Speaker 3>even hundreds of these other kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 3>fisheries out there that don't get the </v>

1239
01:04:04.741 --> 01:04:06.510
<v Speaker 3>same kind of presses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They cod fishery.</v>

1240
01:04:07.220 --> 01:04:08.340
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the big ones.</v>

1241
01:04:08.380 --> 01:04:09.213
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the biggest single thing we have going </v>

1242
01:04:10.591 --> 01:04:13.660
<v Speaker 3>for us now is the lobster and then had </v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

1243
01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:17.190
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a ground fish that is still retaining</v>

1244
01:04:17.191 --> 01:04:20.460
<v Speaker 3>some place in the and the scale of </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

1245
01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:21.353
<v Speaker 3>A very nice fish to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But these are the things that sustain </v>

1246
01:04:23.791 --> 01:04:25.530
<v Speaker 3>the small communities in the social </v>
<v Speaker 3>work,</v>

1247
01:04:25.531 --> 01:04:27.810
<v Speaker 3>Nova Scotia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bay of fundy and so forth.</v>

1248
01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:33.200
<v Speaker 3>But the point here is that the haddock </v>
<v Speaker 3>went down and it went down maybe because</v>

1249
01:04:34.171 --> 01:04:35.004
<v Speaker 3>of what we're fishing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it wasn't on the scale of over </v>

1250
01:04:37.051 --> 01:04:38.090
<v Speaker 3>fishing of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1251
01:04:38.430 --> 01:04:42.450
<v Speaker 3>of the card and almost certainly water </v>
<v Speaker 3>temperature has played a role in it.</v>

1252
01:04:42.660 --> 01:04:43.493
<v Speaker 3>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's cause and effect between fishing </v>

1253
01:04:45.631 --> 01:04:48.450
<v Speaker 3>pressure and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fish abundance?</v>

1254
01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:50.820
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes not very clear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's another one.</v>

1255
01:04:51.270 --> 01:04:52.180
<v Speaker 3>This just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1256
01:04:52.230 --> 01:04:55.860
<v Speaker 3>a friend of mine took this picture last </v>
<v Speaker 3>weekend or the weekend before,</v>

1257
01:04:56.400 --> 01:05:00.220
<v Speaker 3>one day a fishery and you get all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>collections of boats going out and,</v>

1258
01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:01.063
<v Speaker 3>and they kill immensely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They take huge schools of herring and </v>

1259
01:05:04.801 --> 01:05:07.140
<v Speaker 3>then the goals and other birds are </v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

1260
01:05:07.141 --> 01:05:07.974
<v Speaker 3>eagles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>et cetera.</v>

1261
01:05:08.430 --> 01:05:09.263
<v Speaker 3>And the point here though is that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>abundance of herring is that the </v>

1262
01:05:13.171 --> 01:05:15.780
<v Speaker 3>greatest level in the last 30 to 40 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>

1263
01:05:16.750 --> 01:05:17.583
<v Speaker 3>responsible fishery scientist would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have no idea of why they would make </v>

1264
01:05:20.971 --> 01:05:23.530
<v Speaker 3>claim credit to and sales because our </v>
<v Speaker 3>careful management,</v>

1265
01:05:23.770 --> 01:05:25.750
<v Speaker 3>but it's been up and down and up and </v>
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

1266
01:05:26.170 --> 01:05:26.561
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1267
01:05:26.561 --> 01:05:27.394
<v Speaker 3>you don't have time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was an awful lot of interesting </v>

1268
01:05:28.841 --> 01:05:32.560
<v Speaker 3>stories about this fishery and about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>way the native people,</v>

1269
01:05:32.830 --> 01:05:36.520
<v Speaker 3>the first nations along the coast </v>
<v Speaker 3>perceive how it should be managed,</v>

1270
01:05:36.550 --> 01:05:38.410
<v Speaker 3>where they wouldn't have any of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>bullets up there.</v>

1271
01:05:38.411 --> 01:05:39.244
<v Speaker 3>They would be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's mainly managed for herring </v>

1272
01:05:41.141 --> 01:05:41.681
<v Speaker 3>row,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1273
01:05:41.681 --> 01:05:43.540
<v Speaker 3>they eggs and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

1274
01:05:43.541 --> 01:05:46.090
<v Speaker 3>they go to Japan and places like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1275
01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:47.740
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1276
01:05:47.890 --> 01:05:52.890
<v Speaker 3>they would manage by lifting the things </v>
<v Speaker 3>out on of Kelp where they'd been spawned</v>

1277
01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:57.220
<v Speaker 3>by the official themselves and get rid </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the bullets period.</v>

1278
01:05:57.670 --> 01:06:01.330
<v Speaker 3>So there's different points of view of </v>
<v Speaker 3>what you can do and some of those things</v>

1279
01:06:01.390 --> 01:06:03.120
<v Speaker 3>I think are going to be the things for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the future.</v>

1280
01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:05.013
<v Speaker 3>Salmon.</v>

1281
01:06:06.790 --> 01:06:10.360
<v Speaker 3>I have spent a lot of my life looking at</v>
<v Speaker 3>reading about,</v>

1282
01:06:10.780 --> 01:06:11.613
<v Speaker 3>trying to understand Simon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll be the first to say it's really </v>

1283
01:06:13.871 --> 01:06:16.960
<v Speaker 3>difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not the only person to say that.</v>

1284
01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:18.113
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's aboriginal interests which are </v>

1285
01:06:19.961 --> 01:06:23.170
<v Speaker 3>strongly constitutionally supportive </v>
<v Speaker 3>commercial interests,</v>

1286
01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:26.770
<v Speaker 3>which often are on the decline sports </v>
<v Speaker 3>fisheries interests,</v>

1287
01:06:26.830 --> 01:06:27.663
<v Speaker 3>which claim to produce about five to 16 </v>
<v Speaker 3>times the value per fish landed because </v>

1288
01:06:33.701 --> 01:06:35.920
<v Speaker 3>fishermen spent a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1289
01:06:35.921 --> 01:06:39.880
<v Speaker 3>and then there's agriculture and </v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody,</v>

1290
01:06:39.881 --> 01:06:42.460
<v Speaker 3>anybody here from BC?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>

1291
01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:43.473
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that this is not exactly an </v>

1292
01:06:44.381 --> 01:06:46.150
<v Speaker 3>easy subject in British Columbia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1293
01:06:46.151 --> 01:06:49.080
<v Speaker 3>everybody has an opinion on it and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

1294
01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:50.980
<v Speaker 3>it's really difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But look at this.</v>

1295
01:06:51.490 --> 01:06:52.600
<v Speaker 3>This is a plot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1296
01:06:52.630 --> 01:06:53.463
<v Speaker 3>several years ago of watersheds and </v>
<v Speaker 3>counter because you have to involve the </v>

1297
01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.680
<v Speaker 3>freshwater watersheds in British </v>
<v Speaker 3>Columbia.</v>

1298
01:06:59.681 --> 01:07:02.050
<v Speaker 3>I should say we're sockeye salmon is in </v>
<v Speaker 3>decline.</v>

1299
01:07:02.051 --> 01:07:05.950
<v Speaker 3>So the yellow and red watersheds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>huge watershed is under threat.</v>

1300
01:07:06.010 --> 01:07:07.040
<v Speaker 3>That's likely to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1301
01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:08.280
<v Speaker 3>increase,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1302
01:07:08.470 --> 01:07:09.303
<v Speaker 3>because of global warming and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>streams are warming up and other things </v>

1303
01:07:12.281 --> 01:07:13.114
<v Speaker 3>happening in the watersheds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Pine Bark Beetle killing all the </v>

1304
01:07:14.921 --> 01:07:17.740
<v Speaker 3>trees,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trees go and water runs off,</v>

1305
01:07:17.770 --> 01:07:18.603
<v Speaker 3>isn't there for the spawning season.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the salmon's truly in trouble no </v>

1306
01:07:22.151 --> 01:07:24.400
<v Speaker 3>matter what aquaculture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1307
01:07:24.401 --> 01:07:26.020
<v Speaker 3>if you're looking at a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a net like this,</v>

1308
01:07:26.021 --> 01:07:28.510
<v Speaker 3>this is a fairly well run,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1309
01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:29.990
<v Speaker 3>agriculture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1310
01:07:30.310 --> 01:07:31.143
<v Speaker 3>setting in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on each of those netted areas holds </v>

1311
01:07:34.481 --> 01:07:37.000
<v Speaker 3>about 50,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>fish this size.</v>

1312
01:07:37.460 --> 01:07:39.550
<v Speaker 3>And if you've ever seen anything like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that close up,</v>

1313
01:07:39.551 --> 01:07:43.810
<v Speaker 3>it's quite amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is just fish pack in place.</v>

1314
01:07:44.050 --> 01:07:46.430
<v Speaker 3>The fish aren't discontented.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1315
01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:47.390
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1316
01:07:47.620 --> 01:07:49.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's varying points of view about it,</v>

1317
01:07:50.140 --> 01:07:52.080
<v Speaker 3>but some of you may know that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1318
01:07:52.140 --> 01:07:53.680
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our prime minister appointed,</v>

1319
01:07:53.710 --> 01:07:54.590
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1320
01:07:54.780 --> 01:07:55.613
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>justice from British Columbia who was </v>

1321
01:07:56.981 --> 01:08:01.030
<v Speaker 3>called the Koan commission to look at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the future of the Fraser River Salmon,</v>

1322
01:08:01.031 --> 01:08:02.020
<v Speaker 3>the biggest bear run.</v>

1323
01:08:02.710 --> 01:08:03.401
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1324
01:08:03.401 --> 01:08:04.900
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't read all of this,</v>

1325
01:08:04.901 --> 01:08:08.530
<v Speaker 3>but the basic point is that a Cohen </v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

1326
01:08:08.590 --> 01:08:10.270
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if people were expecting that,</v>

1327
01:08:10.271 --> 01:08:13.060
<v Speaker 3>I'd find a smoking gun one causality to </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1328
01:08:13.420 --> 01:08:14.740
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no way.</v>

1329
01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:15.633
<v Speaker 3>And I think I certainly felt that would </v>
<v Speaker 3>be what he would come up with at the </v>

1330
01:08:18.231 --> 01:08:19.910
<v Speaker 3>end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's all sorts of factors,</v>

1331
01:08:20.210 --> 01:08:21.043
<v Speaker 3>but read what he says.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fraser River sockeye face and uncertain </v>

1332
01:08:23.211 --> 01:08:26.340
<v Speaker 3>future shrinking resources,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1333
01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:27.223
<v Speaker 3>which may result in delays in </v>
<v Speaker 3>implementing reforms and research as </v>

1334
01:08:31.031 --> 01:08:32.360
<v Speaker 3>shrinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shrinking resources,</v>

1335
01:08:32.361 --> 01:08:35.840
<v Speaker 3>being less money around dfo has been cut</v>
<v Speaker 3>badly.</v>

1336
01:08:36.970 --> 01:08:37.803
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning that the stressors to with </v>

1337
01:08:39.221 --> 01:08:40.054
<v Speaker 3>Sockeye are exposed will continue and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the deterioration of sockeye habitat </v>

1338
01:08:43.281 --> 01:08:44.114
<v Speaker 3>will get worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The water's constituting Fraser River </v>

1339
01:08:46.221 --> 01:08:47.054
<v Speaker 3>sockeye habitat or warming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then pointing out that basically </v>

1340
01:08:51.740 --> 01:08:55.100
<v Speaker 3>because the government had taken a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 3>of amendments before receiving as a,</v>

1341
01:08:55.370 --> 01:08:56.203
<v Speaker 3>to the fisheries act that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in fact the future of management of the </v>

1342
01:09:00.260 --> 01:09:03.140
<v Speaker 3>Fraser River is unknown and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>putting it in the most positive terms.</v>

1343
01:09:03.630 --> 01:09:04.670
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>

1344
01:09:05.010 --> 01:09:07.340
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are guarded comments,</v>

1345
01:09:07.341 --> 01:09:09.290
<v Speaker 3>the whole report,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the summary of that,</v>

1346
01:09:09.470 --> 01:09:10.303
<v Speaker 3>if you want to get a sense of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>particular very important resource and </v>

1347
01:09:13.611 --> 01:09:15.770
<v Speaker 3>why it's difficult to manage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>read that report.</v>

1348
01:09:16.430 --> 01:09:18.420
<v Speaker 3>So my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

1349
01:09:18.421 --> 01:09:19.370
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>concern.</v>

1350
01:09:19.730 --> 01:09:20.563
<v Speaker 3>So we have these various things that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>can do in Canada for the oceans and two </v>

1351
01:09:23.901 --> 01:09:26.030
<v Speaker 3>big things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is the Fisheries Act,</v>

1352
01:09:26.420 --> 01:09:27.230
<v Speaker 3>which was in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1353
01:09:27.230 --> 01:09:28.063
<v Speaker 3>is in a very old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the first pieces of legislation </v>

1354
01:09:30.111 --> 01:09:30.944
<v Speaker 3>we had encountered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I won't give you a ball boring and </v>

1355
01:09:33.411 --> 01:09:34.244
<v Speaker 3>dull description of all the parts of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it sets the basis for conservation </v>

1356
01:09:37.941 --> 01:09:38.774
<v Speaker 3>of fish for pollution control and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>number of other things related to </v>

1357
01:09:41.331 --> 01:09:42.800
<v Speaker 3>habitat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>etc.</v>

1358
01:09:43.460 --> 01:09:44.293
<v Speaker 3>And also sovereignty over our resource </v>
<v Speaker 3>and sovereignty between the federal </v>

1359
01:09:49.431 --> 01:09:51.700
<v Speaker 3>government and provincial governments </v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1360
01:09:51.710 --> 01:09:53.360
<v Speaker 3>and its management.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1361
01:09:53.361 --> 01:09:55.070
<v Speaker 3>it's a very important piece of </v>
<v Speaker 3>legislation.</v>

1362
01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:57.920
<v Speaker 3>It's been changed quite dramatically in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the last year.</v>

1363
01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:01.880
<v Speaker 3>Placing less emphasis on the habitat </v>
<v Speaker 3>aspect in particular.</v>

1364
01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:03.233
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we also have the oceans act in </v>

1365
01:10:04.431 --> 01:10:05.264
<v Speaker 3>Canada and this was a new piece of </v>
<v Speaker 3>legislation that came out in the 1990s </v>

1366
01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:13.800
<v Speaker 3>and essentially set a new basis of </v>
<v Speaker 3>management around ecosystems,</v>

1367
01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:16.010
<v Speaker 3>sustainable development in another </v>
<v Speaker 3>words,</v>

1368
01:10:16.011 --> 01:10:21.011
<v Speaker 3>balancing between the various kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 3>uses of the ocean and specified the need</v>

1369
01:10:21.261 --> 01:10:25.520
<v Speaker 3>for attention to marine protected areas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also,</v>

1370
01:10:25.950 --> 01:10:26.783
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was called la eventually became </v>

1371
01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:30.193
<v Speaker 3>called wool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most large ocean management areas to </v>

1372
01:10:31.671 --> 01:10:33.980
<v Speaker 3>take big chunks of the ocean and try and</v>
<v Speaker 3>develop,</v>

1373
01:10:34.020 --> 01:10:35.570
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>plans for them.</v>

1374
01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:39.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to give you a very brief </v>
<v Speaker 3>overview of a few of these and you can,</v>

1375
01:10:39.150 --> 01:10:39.983
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>th this talk will be available to </v>

1376
01:10:41.391 --> 01:10:45.200
<v Speaker 3>anybody that wants it and you can see in</v>
<v Speaker 3>more detail but,</v>

1377
01:10:45.230 --> 01:10:46.520
<v Speaker 3>but the Lomas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1378
01:10:46.521 --> 01:10:47.780
<v Speaker 3>represent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1379
01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:48.993
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>move towards the ecosystem based </v>

1380
01:10:50.001 --> 01:10:54.530
<v Speaker 3>approach and one that's based on </v>
<v Speaker 3>consultation among the various users,</v>

1381
01:10:54.531 --> 01:10:57.230
<v Speaker 3>whether they're first nations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether they're oil and gas,</v>

1382
01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:01.190
<v Speaker 3>fisheries and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's building relationships and dialogue</v>

1383
01:11:01.460 --> 01:11:05.600
<v Speaker 3>among the various users.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the idea is to plan for surprises,</v>

1384
01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:06.853
<v Speaker 3>plan for management strategies that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>could actually implement and get that </v>

1385
01:11:11.241 --> 01:11:13.130
<v Speaker 3>information in advance of development.</v>

1386
01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:16.103
<v Speaker 3>So a one that I'm very familiar with is </v>
<v Speaker 3>eastern east coast Scotian shelf and </v>

1387
01:11:21.841 --> 01:11:23.660
<v Speaker 3>they produce good work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1388
01:11:23.730 --> 01:11:25.380
<v Speaker 3>and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I won't talk about it anymore.</v>

1389
01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:28.410
<v Speaker 3>One that's citizen led,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1390
01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:32.700
<v Speaker 3>scientists led and led by both Canada </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the United States is the area of the</v>

1391
01:11:32.701 --> 01:11:35.010
<v Speaker 3>Gulf of Maine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly Georges Bank.</v>

1392
01:11:35.011 --> 01:11:35.844
<v Speaker 3>As part of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then happened to the Bay of Fundy </v>

1393
01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:40.600
<v Speaker 3>and a here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the federal government has a limited,</v>

1394
01:11:40.601 --> 01:11:43.110
<v Speaker 3>it has taken a limited rural,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1395
01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:47.580
<v Speaker 3>and it's been the states and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>provinces working together.</v>

1396
01:11:47.670 --> 01:11:49.920
<v Speaker 3>That's really done some very innovative </v>
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>

1397
01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:52.890
<v Speaker 3>Won't have time to go into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I wanted to say just one thing,</v>

1398
01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:55.860
<v Speaker 3>if you take this is the boundary line </v>
<v Speaker 3>between the two countries.</v>

1399
01:11:55.970 --> 01:11:57.780
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>painfully worked out.</v>

1400
01:11:58.110 --> 01:12:01.350
<v Speaker 3>And I can tell you interesting stories </v>
<v Speaker 3>about that cause I was at some level and</v>

1401
01:12:01.351 --> 01:12:02.910
<v Speaker 3>some of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was very interesting.</v>

1402
01:12:03.300 --> 01:12:04.133
<v Speaker 3>But if you look up towards the Bay of </v>
<v Speaker 3>fundy and into north towards New </v>

1403
01:12:07.380 --> 01:12:08.213
<v Speaker 3>Brunswick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

1404
01:12:08.530 --> 01:12:09.363
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just to the right at the top of the </v>

1405
01:12:11.611 --> 01:12:13.350
<v Speaker 3>line,</v>
<v Speaker 3>top line,</v>

1406
01:12:13.930 --> 01:12:14.763
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whales and ships collide up there </v>

1407
01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:20.273
<v Speaker 3>because that's where it's a natural,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of these areas with lots of </v>

1408
01:12:22.591 --> 01:12:25.020
<v Speaker 3>occurrence flowing and dryers and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>forth.</v>

1409
01:12:25.380 --> 01:12:26.213
<v Speaker 3>And it's incredibly productive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whales come up there to feed in the </v>

1410
01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:30.090
<v Speaker 3>summer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of the scarcest whales,</v>

1411
01:12:30.091 --> 01:12:30.924
<v Speaker 3>humpbacks are there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but some of the other whales and they </v>

1412
01:12:32.881 --> 01:12:35.910
<v Speaker 3>collide with the ships.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you get these ships going up into,</v>

1413
01:12:36.630 --> 01:12:39.600
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly for an oil refinery located</v>

1414
01:12:39.601 --> 01:12:42.390
<v Speaker 3>up there and they find a whale draped </v>
<v Speaker 3>over this.</v>

1415
01:12:42.391 --> 01:12:45.430
<v Speaker 3>They have a kind of a bulbous front on </v>
<v Speaker 3>them and there was a whale of dead whale</v>

1416
01:12:45.431 --> 01:12:46.320
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1417
01:12:46.321 --> 01:12:48.490
<v Speaker 3>and so the right whales particularly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1418
01:12:48.540 --> 01:12:50.910
<v Speaker 3>there's only about 300 of them left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

1419
01:12:51.180 --> 01:12:52.630
<v Speaker 3>and they were being knocked off right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>left,</v>

1420
01:12:53.340 --> 01:12:54.820
<v Speaker 3>no pun intended,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1421
01:12:55.030 --> 01:12:55.863
<v Speaker 3>in that area.</v>

1422
01:12:56.400 --> 01:13:00.030
<v Speaker 3>So there was a simple solution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a very simple solution.</v>

1423
01:13:00.570 --> 01:13:01.403
<v Speaker 3>And one that's worked remarkably well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just changed the shipping lanes </v>

1424
01:13:04.861 --> 01:13:05.694
<v Speaker 3>slightly and they put in place a kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>a spotting mechanism cause you can see </v>

1425
01:13:08.491 --> 01:13:09.324
<v Speaker 3>the whales and so people would know </v>
<v Speaker 3>where the whales tended to be clustered </v>

1426
01:13:11.881 --> 01:13:12.714
<v Speaker 3>on a given day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's some leeway in where the </v>

1427
01:13:13.861 --> 01:13:17.230
<v Speaker 3>ships go and problem not completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>solve,</v>

1428
01:13:17.231 --> 01:13:19.950
<v Speaker 3>but let's say 80% salt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's,</v>

1429
01:13:19.980 --> 01:13:20.813
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there really are win win situations out </v>

1430
01:13:22.351 --> 01:13:26.550
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the charge for that was led by,</v>

1431
01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:29.580
<v Speaker 3>you can see how Nova Scotia goes down to</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of a little point,</v>

1432
01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:31.170
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not the big part of Nova Scotia,</v>

1433
01:13:31.171 --> 01:13:33.750
<v Speaker 3>but there's a little kind of peninsula </v>
<v Speaker 3>and beautiful place.</v>

1434
01:13:34.140 --> 01:13:39.140
<v Speaker 3>Now the school teacher was living out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there and she took it upon herself to be</v>

1435
01:13:39.481 --> 01:13:40.314
<v Speaker 3>part of the solution and organize local </v>
<v Speaker 3>groups to actually spot and be able to </v>

1436
01:13:45.541 --> 01:13:46.374
<v Speaker 3>say where the whales would be and </v>
<v Speaker 3>demonstrated to the scientists who </v>

1437
01:13:49.231 --> 01:13:50.340
<v Speaker 3>didn't really believe in this.</v>

1438
01:13:50.340 --> 01:13:53.910
<v Speaker 3>I don't think very strongly that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it could actually be a solution.</v>

1439
01:13:54.390 --> 01:13:55.223
<v Speaker 3>So it started from a citizen and I have </v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of respect for what I see is </v>

1440
01:13:58.660 --> 01:14:01.000
<v Speaker 3>citizen science in the oceans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1441
01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:01.913
<v Speaker 3>throughout this country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could give you many other examples in </v>

1442
01:14:03.391 --> 01:14:05.280
<v Speaker 3>the west coast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the Arctic and so forth.</v>

1443
01:14:06.420 --> 01:14:07.253
<v Speaker 3>Another one that I think involves a </v>
<v Speaker 3>heavy degree of citizen input is the </v>

1444
01:14:11.231 --> 01:14:12.580
<v Speaker 3>same,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Gulf of Saint Lawrence,</v>

1445
01:14:12.690 --> 01:14:14.020
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>action plan,</v>

1446
01:14:14.021 --> 01:14:16.410
<v Speaker 3>which is being implemented primarily </v>
<v Speaker 3>through a,</v>

1447
01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:18.040
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a environment Canada.</v>

1448
01:14:18.490 --> 01:14:19.323
<v Speaker 3>And here there's something called Zip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't need to go into the details of </v>

1449
01:14:21.390 --> 01:14:22.223
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but zip committees exist throughout the </v>

1450
01:14:23.291 --> 01:14:24.124
<v Speaker 3>golf,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in and around particularly around go </v>

1451
01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:28.420
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all just all of life.</v>

1452
01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:31.280
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>

1453
01:14:31.290 --> 01:14:32.123
<v Speaker 3>the neat thing about it is that a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it brings the stakeholders together and </v>

1454
01:14:35.501 --> 01:14:36.334
<v Speaker 3>they come to real solutions about local </v>
<v Speaker 3>problems that affect their part of the </v>

1455
01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:41.410
<v Speaker 3>Gulf of Saint Lawrence.</v>

1456
01:14:41.410 --> 01:14:42.243
<v Speaker 3>And the government and others provide a </v>
<v Speaker 3>broader input into overall what the St </v>

1457
01:14:48.100 --> 01:14:48.933
<v Speaker 3>Lawrence Action Plan would look like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's some degree of coherence </v>

1458
01:14:50.501 --> 01:14:51.334
<v Speaker 3>throughout the whole region.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now these are good things that are </v>

1459
01:14:53.261 --> 01:14:54.850
<v Speaker 3>happening and they've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1460
01:14:55.450 --> 01:14:58.330
<v Speaker 3>they've been developed by people working</v>
<v Speaker 3>together,</v>

1461
01:14:58.450 --> 01:14:59.283
<v Speaker 3>painstakingly working together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might add for more than a decade of </v>

1462
01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:03.993
<v Speaker 3>interaction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>overcoming all sorts of obstacles or </v>

1463
01:15:06.131 --> 01:15:08.080
<v Speaker 3>differing points of view,</v>
<v Speaker 3>narrow points of view,</v>

1464
01:15:08.081 --> 01:15:08.914
<v Speaker 3>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So these are some of the good things </v>

1465
01:15:10.211 --> 01:15:12.490
<v Speaker 3>that are happening in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1466
01:15:12.491 --> 01:15:16.090
<v Speaker 3>one that I helped to get underway in </v>
<v Speaker 3>terms of some of,</v>

1467
01:15:16.180 --> 01:15:19.330
<v Speaker 3>I won't go into all sorts of stories </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it for time reasons,</v>

1468
01:15:19.331 --> 01:15:23.560
<v Speaker 3>but a terrible name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Penn Sema Pacific North Coast integrated</v>

1469
01:15:23.561 --> 01:15:25.750
<v Speaker 3>management area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this includes,</v>

1470
01:15:25.950 --> 01:15:26.960
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I,</v>

1471
01:15:26.961 --> 01:15:29.830
<v Speaker 3>I hate the word also worldclass the </v>
<v Speaker 3>phrase world class,</v>

1472
01:15:29.831 --> 01:15:34.831
<v Speaker 3>but the oceans in this area are stunning</v>
<v Speaker 3>in terms of the diversity of life,</v>

1473
01:15:35.810 --> 01:15:36.643
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and also the intactness of the </v>

1474
01:15:37.931 --> 01:15:42.931
<v Speaker 3>ecosystems in this whole area in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>northern part of Vancouver Island.</v>

1475
01:15:43.950 --> 01:15:45.700
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>up to Prince Rupert,</v>

1476
01:15:45.730 --> 01:15:48.790
<v Speaker 3>there's only 15 or 20,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>people living in that whole area.</v>

1477
01:15:49.140 --> 01:15:52.780
<v Speaker 3>And that's an area that's probably about</v>
<v Speaker 3>as long as the cost of much of the coast</v>

1478
01:15:52.781 --> 01:15:53.950
<v Speaker 3>of Norway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>

1479
01:15:54.380 --> 01:15:57.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm absolutely fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>intact ecosystems.</v>

1480
01:15:57.491 --> 01:15:58.324
<v Speaker 3>You can fly at a reasonably low levels </v>
<v Speaker 3>and see gigantic sunfish floating on </v>

1481
01:16:02.411 --> 01:16:04.540
<v Speaker 3>their side into the weigh a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 3>pounds or more.</v>

1482
01:16:05.020 --> 01:16:05.853
<v Speaker 3>You can see whales,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can see if you're in a boat where </v>

1483
01:16:08.741 --> 01:16:11.350
<v Speaker 3>the seabirds go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's important,</v>

1484
01:16:11.380 --> 01:16:12.370
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1485
01:16:12.510 --> 01:16:14.710
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fisheries activities in that as well.</v>

1486
01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:16.710
<v Speaker 3>There's a wonderful atlas of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1487
01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:19.480
<v Speaker 3>if you want to look at it online and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can download that,</v>

1488
01:16:19.810 --> 01:16:21.340
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1489
01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:22.233
<v Speaker 3>there's all sorts of other activities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is drawn from that atlas just </v>

1490
01:16:25.211 --> 01:16:26.900
<v Speaker 3>showing who's got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1491
01:16:27.250 --> 01:16:28.083
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oil and gas exploratory wells and </v>

1492
01:16:29.420 --> 01:16:31.330
<v Speaker 3>tenures in the area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1493
01:16:31.370 --> 01:16:31.781
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1494
01:16:31.781 --> 01:16:33.730
<v Speaker 3>all sorts of people have staked that </v>
<v Speaker 3>territory.</v>

1495
01:16:33.730 --> 01:16:35.590
<v Speaker 3>There's another one that shows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1496
01:16:35.850 --> 01:16:37.480
<v Speaker 3>all sorts of different fisheries </v>
<v Speaker 3>interests.</v>

1497
01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:39.370
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>interspersed with those,</v>

1498
01:16:39.460 --> 01:16:40.780
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I've got the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1499
01:16:40.781 --> 01:16:42.020
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1500
01:16:42.820 --> 01:16:45.010
<v Speaker 3>I took it out for time reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1501
01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:48.430
<v Speaker 3>if I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I could show you where the corals are</v>

1502
01:16:48.910 --> 01:16:51.310
<v Speaker 3>and where there's the thing called a </v>
<v Speaker 3>glass sponges,</v>

1503
01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:55.270
<v Speaker 3>which we thought were creatures that had</v>
<v Speaker 3>gone extinct.</v>

1504
01:16:55.330 --> 01:16:56.163
<v Speaker 3>They were studying as fossils in Germany</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that was where they found the </v>

1505
01:16:58.931 --> 01:16:59.764
<v Speaker 3>veranda.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The areas I think that are fossilized </v>

1506
01:17:02.861 --> 01:17:06.070
<v Speaker 3>now in Germany and suddenly about 15 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>

1507
01:17:06.130 --> 01:17:11.120
<v Speaker 3>somebody discovered that there was huge </v>
<v Speaker 3>beds of these things around this area.</v>

1508
01:17:11.121 --> 01:17:13.460
<v Speaker 3>They're primarily in the area that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of a pale orange.</v>

1509
01:17:14.090 --> 01:17:17.270
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what are you going to do about it?</v>

1510
01:17:17.690 --> 01:17:18.523
<v Speaker 3>These were areas that were just </v>
<v Speaker 3>beginning to be used heavily by </v>

1511
01:17:20.961 --> 01:17:23.660
<v Speaker 3>trawlers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The trawlers were starting to plow right</v>

1512
01:17:23.661 --> 01:17:25.520
<v Speaker 3>through these ancient beds because these</v>
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>

1513
01:17:25.521 --> 01:17:27.140
<v Speaker 3>some of these are thousands of years </v>
<v Speaker 3>old.</v>

1514
01:17:27.670 --> 01:17:28.470
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1515
01:17:28.470 --> 01:17:29.540
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1516
01:17:29.541 --> 01:17:31.100
<v Speaker 3>stock was put to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1517
01:17:31.460 --> 01:17:33.830
<v Speaker 3>and now they're all applauded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know where they are.</v>

1518
01:17:33.860 --> 01:17:37.130
<v Speaker 3>There's an exclusion zones for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>corals for the,</v>

1519
01:17:37.131 --> 01:17:38.510
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fisheries in the same,</v>

1520
01:17:39.210 --> 01:17:41.490
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Iran up till about 2000,</v>

1521
01:17:41.930 --> 01:17:44.930
<v Speaker 3>there was an official almost denial that</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a,</v>

1522
01:17:44.970 --> 01:17:45.803
<v Speaker 3>the soft corals that were found on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>east coast and the fishermen had been </v>

1523
01:17:48.411 --> 01:17:49.244
<v Speaker 3>complaining about a particularly long </v>
<v Speaker 3>liners that the trawlers were going </v>

1524
01:17:51.831 --> 01:17:52.664
<v Speaker 3>through and bringing up these things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I went to a Fisher Fishery </v>

1525
01:17:56.180 --> 01:17:57.013
<v Speaker 3>Association for museum and Southwest </v>
<v Speaker 3>Nova Scotia and the handle these big </v>

1526
01:17:59.481 --> 01:18:04.481
<v Speaker 3>corals and if you went on the west coast</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do some of the commercial,</v>

1527
01:18:04.731 --> 01:18:07.290
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sports fishing shops and boats,</v>

1528
01:18:07.540 --> 01:18:10.100
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>places they'd have them on the wall.</v>

1529
01:18:10.101 --> 01:18:11.630
<v Speaker 3>The same thing on the west coast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1530
01:18:11.690 --> 01:18:15.740
<v Speaker 3>officially they didn't exist and finally</v>
<v Speaker 3>they did exist.</v>

1531
01:18:15.741 --> 01:18:16.574
<v Speaker 3>And now there's all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 3>exclusionary is for the red corals as </v>

1532
01:18:18.771 --> 01:18:19.400
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

1533
01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:22.220
<v Speaker 3>So progress but it's slow and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>painful.</v>

1534
01:18:22.610 --> 01:18:23.443
<v Speaker 3>The northern gateway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to even touch tonight if </v>

1535
01:18:25.131 --> 01:18:30.131
<v Speaker 3>you want to ask me questions about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is the prime example now of why</v>

1536
01:18:30.381 --> 01:18:31.214
<v Speaker 3>we need something like Benzema to </v>
<v Speaker 3>generate the kind of data that would be </v>

1537
01:18:34.881 --> 01:18:37.100
<v Speaker 3>helpful to know how much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1538
01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:39.770
<v Speaker 3>what is their actual risk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unfortunately,</v>

1539
01:18:40.310 --> 01:18:41.143
<v Speaker 3>for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the government has decided to more or </v>

1540
01:18:43.281 --> 01:18:44.540
<v Speaker 3>less,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not totally,</v>

1541
01:18:44.541 --> 01:18:46.290
<v Speaker 3>but more or less,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1542
01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:50.500
<v Speaker 3>got the cooperation that had been </v>
<v Speaker 3>established hoop and Sema and,</v>

1543
01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:52.760
<v Speaker 3>and that mechanism it seems to be lost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1544
01:18:53.390 --> 01:18:56.300
<v Speaker 3>another one in the north is the Beaufort</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sea partnership,</v>

1545
01:18:56.630 --> 01:18:57.463
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in which is a complicated thing and you </v>

1546
01:18:59.241 --> 01:19:00.074
<v Speaker 3>can see the vision of it is basically a </v>
<v Speaker 3>ecosystem health and supporting </v>

1547
01:19:04.311 --> 01:19:05.144
<v Speaker 3>sustainable communities and economies </v>
<v Speaker 3>for future generations as well as the </v>

1548
01:19:08.661 --> 01:19:09.494
<v Speaker 3>present.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem with the Beaufort Sea </v>

1549
01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:15.380
<v Speaker 3>partnership is there's a lot of things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that relate to land claims and,</v>

1550
01:19:15.381 --> 01:19:16.730
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1551
01:19:17.210 --> 01:19:19.350
<v Speaker 3>northern,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1552
01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:23.300
<v Speaker 3>local peoples up there that have made it</v>
<v Speaker 3>very difficult.</v>

1553
01:19:23.530 --> 01:19:26.600
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not blaming them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's just there's a lot of obstacles</v>

1554
01:19:26.601 --> 01:19:29.780
<v Speaker 3>in the way still to make this move as </v>
<v Speaker 3>fast as it should.</v>

1555
01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:31.313
<v Speaker 3>Another one where another mechanism is </v>
<v Speaker 3>in place now and we're starting to get </v>

1556
01:19:35.511 --> 01:19:38.150
<v Speaker 3>in places lancaster sound,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lancaster sound,</v>

1557
01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:41.330
<v Speaker 3>who is one of the first places where </v>
<v Speaker 3>there were see use planning in Canada.</v>

1558
01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:42.513
<v Speaker 3>And at that time that was in the 1980s.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People were kind of looking at it as a </v>

1559
01:19:45.651 --> 01:19:49.370
<v Speaker 3>bit of a curiosity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now this is a very important part of the</v>

1560
01:19:49.460 --> 01:19:50.293
<v Speaker 3>northwest passage that will become one </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the areas used for shipping </v>

1561
01:19:53.271 --> 01:19:54.104
<v Speaker 3>eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a large part of that has now </v>

1562
01:19:56.421 --> 01:19:59.990
<v Speaker 3>proposed as a national conservation area</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1563
01:20:00.010 --> 01:20:00.980
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1564
01:20:00.981 --> 01:20:04.370
<v Speaker 3>it'll be very interesting to see what </v>
<v Speaker 3>this will actually mean in reality.</v>

1565
01:20:04.790 --> 01:20:05.623
<v Speaker 3>Now I want to point out the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the national marine conservation area </v>

1566
01:20:09.300 --> 01:20:13.500
<v Speaker 3>because we actually have legislation </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying that all the representative areas</v>

1567
01:20:13.501 --> 01:20:16.020
<v Speaker 3>in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's 26 or 27 of them,</v>

1568
01:20:16.021 --> 01:20:16.854
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

1569
01:20:17.100 --> 01:20:17.933
<v Speaker 3>Each of those kinds of habitats should </v>
<v Speaker 3>have representative areas where you </v>

1570
01:20:21.631 --> 01:20:26.130
<v Speaker 3>could actually pinpoint and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aha,</v>

1571
01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:28.560
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this area is protected within that.</v>

1572
01:20:28.561 --> 01:20:29.394
<v Speaker 3>And it will tell us about the area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could be abused for fisheries </v>

1573
01:20:32.581 --> 01:20:33.920
<v Speaker 3>management and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1574
01:20:34.020 --> 01:20:36.410
<v Speaker 3>helping to replenish their stocks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1575
01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:37.313
<v Speaker 3>were far from there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just to highlight again what Jordan was </v>

1576
01:20:41.551 --> 01:20:42.480
<v Speaker 3>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>

1577
01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:43.433
<v Speaker 3>look at the small percentage of </v>
<v Speaker 3>protected areas in the oceans in Canada </v>

1578
01:20:47.790 --> 01:20:48.623
<v Speaker 3>compared to the line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And most people would say on the land </v>

1579
01:20:50.491 --> 01:20:51.450
<v Speaker 3>areas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not enough.</v>

1580
01:20:52.020 --> 01:20:52.853
<v Speaker 3>So I don't look at the detail of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but these shows all these different </v>

1581
01:20:56.760 --> 01:20:58.320
<v Speaker 3>types of areas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1582
01:20:58.550 --> 01:20:59.383
<v Speaker 3>you can look at Hudson Bay for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or the north and south part of west </v>

1583
01:21:05.431 --> 01:21:06.480
<v Speaker 3>coast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pacific coast.</v>

1584
01:21:06.780 --> 01:21:08.850
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of areas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but particularly in the Arctic,</v>

1585
01:21:09.110 --> 01:21:09.880
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

1586
01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:14.220
<v Speaker 3>we need a lot more effort.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things that a c pause,</v>

1587
01:21:14.221 --> 01:21:17.340
<v Speaker 3>which has been a prime,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a contributor to this,</v>

1588
01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:18.593
<v Speaker 3>they have a whole list of things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they feel are urgent priorities for </v>

1589
01:21:22.001 --> 01:21:23.100
<v Speaker 3>marine protected areas.</v>

1590
01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:25.920
<v Speaker 3>And they're not all being acted on at </v>
<v Speaker 3>this point in time.</v>

1591
01:21:26.670 --> 01:21:30.060
<v Speaker 3>So we do have a document and talk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>talk,</v>

1592
01:21:30.061 --> 01:21:30.661
<v Speaker 3>talk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>talk.</v>

1593
01:21:30.661 --> 01:21:34.110
<v Speaker 3>It's very cheap called the national </v>
<v Speaker 3>network of Mbas.</v>

1594
01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:37.470
<v Speaker 3>Do we have a national network of Mbas in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Canada?</v>

1595
01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:38.873
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well here's one point of view from a </v>

1596
01:21:40.111 --> 01:21:43.380
<v Speaker 3>person who I respect a lot through the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Pew Foundation.</v>

1597
01:21:43.381 --> 01:21:44.214
<v Speaker 3>Daniel Pauly from UBC fishery center is </v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the people that really </v>

1598
01:21:47.191 --> 01:21:48.024
<v Speaker 3>understands the oceans and fisheries </v>
<v Speaker 3>very well in Canada and around the </v>

1599
01:21:50.551 --> 01:21:52.020
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1600
01:21:52.070 --> 01:21:53.670
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's been running something,</v>

1601
01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:55.193
<v Speaker 3>a database called MPA global,</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at marine protected areas all </v>

1602
01:21:58.381 --> 01:21:59.214
<v Speaker 3>around the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then if you go and look at the </v>

1603
01:22:01.231 --> 01:22:04.620
<v Speaker 3>Canadian entries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's 574 of them,</v>

1604
01:22:04.710 --> 01:22:08.070
<v Speaker 3>including provincial coastal parks and </v>
<v Speaker 3>ecological reserves and so forth.</v>

1605
01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:12.180
<v Speaker 3>I can go out in my kayak and go right </v>
<v Speaker 3>around the ecological reserves,</v>

1606
01:22:12.420 --> 01:22:14.400
<v Speaker 3>two kilometers off shore from where I </v>
<v Speaker 3>live,</v>

1607
01:22:14.710 --> 01:22:15.630
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for birds,</v>

1608
01:22:15.780 --> 01:22:18.480
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rain parks in British Columbia,</v>

1609
01:22:18.481 --> 01:22:19.560
<v Speaker 3>there's dozens of them.</v>

1610
01:22:19.830 --> 01:22:21.240
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're mainly for,</v>

1611
01:22:21.300 --> 01:22:23.690
<v Speaker 3>they've been chosen not for their </v>
<v Speaker 3>ecological value,</v>

1612
01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:25.500
<v Speaker 3>although sometimes there is ecological </v>
<v Speaker 3>value,</v>

1613
01:22:25.501 --> 01:22:29.490
<v Speaker 3>but it's nice safe shelters for boats </v>
<v Speaker 3>that go up and down the coast,</v>

1614
01:22:29.491 --> 01:22:30.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>small,</v>

1615
01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:31.740
<v Speaker 3>pleasurable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a big pleasure bullets.</v>

1616
01:22:32.190 --> 01:22:32.970
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1617
01:22:32.970 --> 01:22:36.930
<v Speaker 3>this is kind of overstates the case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not Daniel polly's fault.</v>

1618
01:22:36.931 --> 01:22:39.990
<v Speaker 3>This is following certain criteria.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1619
01:22:40.350 --> 01:22:45.350
<v Speaker 3>we're starting to see this now emerge as</v>
<v Speaker 3>networks within the regions.</v>

1620
01:22:46.260 --> 01:22:48.050
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1621
01:22:48.300 --> 01:22:51.090
<v Speaker 3>there's whale sanctuaries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>coral sanctuaries,</v>

1622
01:22:51.930 --> 01:22:52.763
<v Speaker 3>and a place called the gully where a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the really interesting whales that </v>

1623
01:22:56.491 --> 01:22:57.324
<v Speaker 3>are off shore from Nova Scotia collect </v>
<v Speaker 3>now and then there's a lot of actually </v>

1624
01:23:01.231 --> 01:23:04.650
<v Speaker 3>land based ones so that you're primarily</v>
<v Speaker 3>for birds and protection of wetlands.</v>

1625
01:23:05.890 --> 01:23:09.010
<v Speaker 3>The problem with this is can you really </v>
<v Speaker 3>call it a network?</v>

1626
01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:10.610
<v Speaker 3>What are the criteria?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

1627
01:23:10.660 --> 01:23:13.150
<v Speaker 3>how will it relate?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How will all of this relate,</v>

1628
01:23:13.290 --> 01:23:15.280
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I've got on this diagram?</v>

1629
01:23:15.580 --> 01:23:18.460
<v Speaker 3>How will it relate to sustainable </v>
<v Speaker 3>fisheries management?</v>

1630
01:23:18.940 --> 01:23:21.640
<v Speaker 3>Because that's the kind of question that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we should be asking.</v>

1631
01:23:21.940 --> 01:23:25.660
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we're asking that question</v>
<v Speaker 3>very well and Canada now,</v>

1632
01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:26.793
<v Speaker 3>but I would urge fin to be thinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about that when you're thinking about </v>

1633
01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:31.833
<v Speaker 3>sustainability of seafood and so forth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how does it relate back to the other </v>

1634
01:23:35.021 --> 01:23:38.800
<v Speaker 3>things in the ocean ecosystem and how </v>
<v Speaker 3>can we use those tools better?</v>

1635
01:23:39.460 --> 01:23:40.680
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Penn Sema,</v>

1636
01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:41.913
<v Speaker 3>this diagram shows the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these different places that I </v>

1637
01:23:46.781 --> 01:23:47.614
<v Speaker 3>mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the corals and other areas that deserve </v>

1638
01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:51.220
<v Speaker 3>some sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1639
01:23:51.900 --> 01:23:52.733
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>protection of one sort or another from </v>

1640
01:23:55.240 --> 01:23:57.350
<v Speaker 3>here and now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1641
01:23:57.940 --> 01:23:58.773
<v Speaker 3>management issues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things like the trawlers and other </v>

1642
01:24:01.241 --> 01:24:03.040
<v Speaker 3>activities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oil and gas in some cases.</v>

1643
01:24:03.490 --> 01:24:08.490
<v Speaker 3>Now here is the makings of at least a </v>
<v Speaker 3>west coast northwest coast network.</v>

1644
01:24:10.780 --> 01:24:13.210
<v Speaker 3>Here's what I'd like to see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1645
01:24:13.990 --> 01:24:17.560
<v Speaker 3>if you look at Penn seem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I've taken it up to the 200 miles on</v>

1646
01:24:17.561 --> 01:24:20.380
<v Speaker 3>it because I feel we should be going out</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the 200 miles on this,</v>

1647
01:24:20.860 --> 01:24:23.650
<v Speaker 3>but if you had a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I call it boy to brooks.</v>

1648
01:24:24.130 --> 01:24:26.920
<v Speaker 3>Brooks peninsula is a really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should've put a picture of it.</v>

1649
01:24:26.921 --> 01:24:28.810
<v Speaker 3>And it's so interesting to see it from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the air.</v>

1650
01:24:29.460 --> 01:24:29.991
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1651
01:24:29.991 --> 01:24:30.824
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a finger of land that goes out to the </v>

1652
01:24:32.171 --> 01:24:34.600
<v Speaker 3>sea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that an interesting place?</v>

1653
01:24:34.601 --> 01:24:35.434
<v Speaker 3>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1654
01:24:35.500 --> 01:24:36.333
<v Speaker 3>during the Second World War when we were</v>
<v Speaker 3>patrolling all along the coast for a </v>

1655
01:24:39.340 --> 01:24:43.120
<v Speaker 3>ship's coming across automation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of ship,</v>

1656
01:24:43.150 --> 01:24:48.150
<v Speaker 3>a lot of airplanes were lost in the boy </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the brooks peninsula because right at</v>

1657
01:24:49.631 --> 01:24:52.770
<v Speaker 3>that point there's a change in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>current and you get all,</v>

1658
01:24:52.940 --> 01:24:53.773
<v Speaker 3>so there's a north and south current </v>
<v Speaker 3>coming and they change seasonally and </v>

1659
01:24:57.460 --> 01:25:01.210
<v Speaker 3>right at that point you can get a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've talked to a pilot about this when I</v>

1660
01:25:01.211 --> 01:25:02.044
<v Speaker 3>was flying over it with him and he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying that he had actually seen what </v>

1661
01:25:05.150 --> 01:25:08.740
<v Speaker 3>looked like Niagara Falls coming up </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of the currents are clashing.</v>

1662
01:25:08.740 --> 01:25:11.830
<v Speaker 3>You get this water coming up rising out </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the ocean.</v>

1663
01:25:12.340 --> 01:25:13.091
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

1664
01:25:13.091 --> 01:25:13.924
<v Speaker 3>he said it was just like this wall of </v>
<v Speaker 3>water coming up and then crashing down </v>

1665
01:25:16.781 --> 01:25:17.614
<v Speaker 3>the other side in the atmosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So these are the things that only pilot </v>

1666
01:25:21.291 --> 01:25:21.821
<v Speaker 3>see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess,</v>

1667
01:25:21.821 --> 01:25:23.650
<v Speaker 3>but he said it exceedingly dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 3>area,</v>

1668
01:25:23.980 --> 01:25:25.430
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's uh,</v>

1669
01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:26.433
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a very important area separating the </v>

1670
01:25:27.791 --> 01:25:30.400
<v Speaker 3>north and the south and the kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 3>animal migrations,</v>

1671
01:25:30.401 --> 01:25:34.360
<v Speaker 3>whales and so forth and see birds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then if you look at the top end,</v>

1672
01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:37.750
<v Speaker 3>there's the boys see mode and there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>sea mounts.</v>

1673
01:25:37.751 --> 01:25:41.020
<v Speaker 3>These mountains that rise up almost to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ocean,</v>

1674
01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:42.850
<v Speaker 3>top of the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1675
01:25:43.030 --> 01:25:43.863
<v Speaker 3>but in the case of Boise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mounted comes within 75 feet of the </v>

1676
01:25:47.201 --> 01:25:48.034
<v Speaker 3>surface.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I have talked to people that have </v>

1677
01:25:50.351 --> 01:25:51.184
<v Speaker 3>gone out there and their cell phones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>big sailboats and scuba dived on that </v>

1678
01:25:54.881 --> 01:25:55.480
<v Speaker 3>seem odd.</v>

1679
01:25:55.480 --> 01:25:58.360
<v Speaker 3>It's filled with life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's absolutely filled with life.</v>

1680
01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:01.750
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so we have a whole series of these.</v>

1681
01:26:01.930 --> 01:26:02.763
<v Speaker 3>This is the only one that gets any </v>
<v Speaker 3>protection whatsoever from fishing as </v>

1682
01:26:06.411 --> 01:26:07.244
<v Speaker 3>far as I can tell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's other things in the scone </v>

1683
01:26:08.870 --> 01:26:11.080
<v Speaker 3>olins and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1684
01:26:11.510 --> 01:26:16.070
<v Speaker 3>rarity is very important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll look in the estuaries.</v>

1685
01:26:16.230 --> 01:26:17.900
<v Speaker 3>Another one of these strange little </v>
<v Speaker 3>fish,</v>

1686
01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:19.233
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that I won't go into the sponge </v>

1687
01:26:20.361 --> 01:26:24.890
<v Speaker 3>reefs and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is not just a big blend,</v>

1688
01:26:25.100 --> 01:26:28.070
<v Speaker 3>a body of light blue or anything like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1689
01:26:28.071 --> 01:26:29.780
<v Speaker 3>When you start looking at what's on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bottom,</v>

1690
01:26:30.110 --> 01:26:33.590
<v Speaker 3>it needs protection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Sea otters coming back,</v>

1691
01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:34.680
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1692
01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:36.290
<v Speaker 3>and they're part of the ecosystem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

1693
01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:37.593
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some first nations hate them because </v>

1694
01:26:40.370 --> 01:26:41.203
<v Speaker 3>they're taking moistures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're taking all sorts of creatures </v>

1695
01:26:43.581 --> 01:26:45.400
<v Speaker 3>that they want to harvest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1696
01:26:45.950 --> 01:26:49.570
<v Speaker 3>the coral reefs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've mentioned way Hannah's,</v>

1697
01:26:49.810 --> 01:26:50.643
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is land co managed between Parks </v>

1698
01:26:53.751 --> 01:26:58.751
<v Speaker 3>Canada and now a marine conservation </v>
<v Speaker 3>under area under the Marine Conservation</v>

1699
01:26:58.970 --> 01:27:03.330
<v Speaker 3>Act and the Haida people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the most innovative systems of co</v>

1700
01:27:03.331 --> 01:27:05.510
<v Speaker 3>management anywhere in the world.</v>

1701
01:27:06.110 --> 01:27:11.110
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is fabulous and this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to mean a whole different approach</v>

1702
01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:14.820
<v Speaker 3>towards fisheries management in the area</v>
<v Speaker 3>towards,</v>

1703
01:27:14.900 --> 01:27:15.733
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how the Haida people perceive their </v>

1704
01:27:18.021 --> 01:27:18.854
<v Speaker 3>responsibilities and how the government </v>
<v Speaker 3>of Canada and the province of Canada </v>

1705
01:27:21.951 --> 01:27:22.860
<v Speaker 3>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1706
01:27:23.060 --> 01:27:24.920
<v Speaker 3>it's all done in a Cole management </v>
<v Speaker 3>basis.</v>

1707
01:27:25.130 --> 01:27:28.400
<v Speaker 3>This is one of the most exciting things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you can possibly imagine.</v>

1708
01:27:29.030 --> 01:27:33.110
<v Speaker 3>And this is what the southern end can </v>
<v Speaker 3>see down that yellow tip,</v>

1709
01:27:33.350 --> 01:27:34.183
<v Speaker 3>the southern end,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which happens to be where the highest </v>

1710
01:27:37.401 --> 01:27:38.234
<v Speaker 3>recorded winds were ever recorded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was off a test oil rig there in </v>

1711
01:27:42.351 --> 01:27:43.184
<v Speaker 3>the 1970s,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was 200 kilometers and hour </v>

1712
01:27:45.831 --> 01:27:49.400
<v Speaker 3>or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is the kind of habitat that's up</v>

1713
01:27:49.401 --> 01:27:50.234
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you can see the animals that are </v>

1714
01:27:50.871 --> 01:27:54.050
<v Speaker 3>living there at the sea lions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the beautiful area.</v>

1715
01:27:54.700 --> 01:27:56.860
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oops.</v>

1716
01:27:58.150 --> 01:28:03.150
<v Speaker 3>Cmon um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>above that rock fish,</v>

1717
01:28:03.830 --> 01:28:07.730
<v Speaker 3>those fish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many of them are 70 years old.</v>

1718
01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:10.550
<v Speaker 3>And as some of my colleagues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want to protect them to say,</v>

1719
01:28:10.551 --> 01:28:13.850
<v Speaker 3>would you eat your grandparents because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're delicious.</v>

1720
01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:19.000
<v Speaker 3>They're served on many menus and a not </v>
<v Speaker 3>very sustainably harvested.</v>

1721
01:28:21.590 --> 01:28:25.430
<v Speaker 3>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>before boys see mount,</v>

1722
01:28:25.431 --> 01:28:27.710
<v Speaker 3>while it was still under consideration,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just a,</v>

1723
01:28:27.750 --> 01:28:28.700
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1724
01:28:28.820 --> 01:28:29.653
<v Speaker 3>a plot of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the depth contours and these currents </v>

1725
01:28:32.451 --> 01:28:35.390
<v Speaker 3>that circulate around on the boys seem </v>
<v Speaker 3>odd,</v>

1726
01:28:35.990 --> 01:28:40.640
<v Speaker 3>but fishermen were being told to go out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there and fish while they still could.</v>

1727
01:28:41.330 --> 01:28:44.150
<v Speaker 3>So even in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is safe,</v>

1728
01:28:44.210 --> 01:28:45.043
<v Speaker 3>seven or eight years ago when it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>actively knowing that boise is going to </v>

1729
01:28:48.351 --> 01:28:51.200
<v Speaker 3>be handled,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was boats going out there.</v>

1730
01:28:51.530 --> 01:28:52.363
<v Speaker 3>So now that problem is solved,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's all these other problems </v>

1731
01:28:55.460 --> 01:28:56.293
<v Speaker 3>along the coast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Should you allow bullets to go out to </v>

1732
01:28:58.041 --> 01:29:01.880
<v Speaker 3>other seamounts triangle island?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1733
01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:03.820
<v Speaker 3>most amazing place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1734
01:29:05.190 --> 01:29:07.200
<v Speaker 3>the day I went out there and the pilot </v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

1735
01:29:07.201 --> 01:29:08.034
<v Speaker 3>you were lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get one to two days a year when it </v>

1736
01:29:10.711 --> 01:29:12.810
<v Speaker 3>looks like this is not covered in rain </v>
<v Speaker 3>fog.</v>

1737
01:29:13.110 --> 01:29:14.910
<v Speaker 3>You can see the little blip on the top </v>
<v Speaker 3>of it.</v>

1738
01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:17.490
<v Speaker 3>That was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a light house.</v>

1739
01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:20.220
<v Speaker 3>They put the light house up in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1740
01:29:20.850 --> 01:29:22.080
<v Speaker 3>in the club level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So no,</v>

1741
01:29:22.081 --> 01:29:23.730
<v Speaker 3>the light house keepers could never see </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1742
01:29:24.180 --> 01:29:25.013
<v Speaker 3>The weather was so bad there that </v>
<v Speaker 3>lighthouse keepers often would get no </v>

1743
01:29:28.021 --> 01:29:32.040
<v Speaker 3>food for two or three months at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1744
01:29:32.310 --> 01:29:33.143
<v Speaker 3>sadly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the lighthouse keepers went </v>

1745
01:29:34.291 --> 01:29:36.060
<v Speaker 3>crazy out there as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1746
01:29:36.061 --> 01:29:38.130
<v Speaker 3>and there's only the base of the light </v>
<v Speaker 3>house,</v>

1747
01:29:38.190 --> 01:29:39.023
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>left,</v>

1748
01:29:39.300 --> 01:29:41.220
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hurricane blew the Adelaide house itself</v>

1749
01:29:41.221 --> 01:29:42.470
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1750
01:29:42.780 --> 01:29:43.613
<v Speaker 3>and so they also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the leading scientists that </v>

1751
01:29:45.331 --> 01:29:46.920
<v Speaker 3>studied,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a great place,</v>

1752
01:29:46.921 --> 01:29:49.350
<v Speaker 3>one of the great nesting areas for </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain,</v>

1753
01:29:49.380 --> 01:29:50.213
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1754
01:29:50.220 --> 01:29:52.230
<v Speaker 3>important seabirds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1755
01:29:52.310 --> 01:29:54.720
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sadly one of the scientists fell off the</v>

1756
01:29:54.721 --> 01:29:55.554
<v Speaker 3>cliff and she died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a wonderful book though that's </v>

1757
01:29:57.811 --> 01:29:59.700
<v Speaker 3>been written about triangle island,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1758
01:30:00.060 --> 01:30:02.450
<v Speaker 3>with a lot of watercolors and so forth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1759
01:30:02.580 --> 01:30:05.970
<v Speaker 3>by an artist that went out at a later </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

1760
01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:06.511
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1761
01:30:06.511 --> 01:30:08.340
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a very interesting spot.</v>

1762
01:30:08.790 --> 01:30:10.500
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you think those things are?</v>

1763
01:30:11.140 --> 01:30:11.973
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>innovation with ocean technology and </v>

1764
01:30:13.591 --> 01:30:16.950
<v Speaker 3>sovereignty issues such as signing onto </v>
<v Speaker 3>the law of the sea.</v>

1765
01:30:16.951 --> 01:30:19.830
<v Speaker 3>We never ratified the law of the seed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example.</v>

1766
01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:25.620
<v Speaker 3>I think it's time to revisit and </v>
<v Speaker 3>strengthen our commitment to the ocean.</v>

1767
01:30:26.100 --> 01:30:29.100
<v Speaker 3>I think we've made a start with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>oceans action plan,</v>

1768
01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:30.880
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1769
01:30:31.120 --> 01:30:31.953
<v Speaker 3>we've got some good points and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>faltering in some key areas and not </v>

1770
01:30:34.861 --> 01:30:38.580
<v Speaker 3>enough resources or even attention is </v>
<v Speaker 3>being given to do it.</v>

1771
01:30:39.210 --> 01:30:41.670
<v Speaker 3>Ask when the last time this was reviewed</v>
<v Speaker 3>in parliament,</v>

1772
01:30:41.671 --> 01:30:44.130
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fisheries,</v>

1773
01:30:44.760 --> 01:30:45.593
<v Speaker 3>as far as I can see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the committee that deals with fisheries </v>

1774
01:30:50.010 --> 01:30:54.150
<v Speaker 3>and oceans matters and the current </v>
<v Speaker 3>parliament is,</v>

1775
01:30:54.230 --> 01:30:55.063
<v Speaker 3>we pretty much dysfunctional,</v>
<v Speaker 3>certainly not dealing with the kinds of </v>

1776
01:30:57.421 --> 01:30:59.160
<v Speaker 3>questions that we're talking about here </v>
<v Speaker 3>tonight.</v>

1777
01:30:59.670 --> 01:31:04.670
<v Speaker 3>It will probably receive the report of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Commissioner on the environment,</v>

1778
01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:05.850
<v Speaker 3>sustainable development.</v>

1779
01:31:05.850 --> 01:31:07.680
<v Speaker 3>An Mba's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thank you.</v>

1780
01:31:07.710 --> 01:31:08.543
<v Speaker 3>We probably won't be needing any serious</v>
<v Speaker 3>discussion of this longterm discussion </v>

1781
01:31:11.671 --> 01:31:13.410
<v Speaker 3>of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you very much for your hard work.</v>

1782
01:31:13.860 --> 01:31:16.560
<v Speaker 3>And that's what things are degraded to </v>
<v Speaker 3>at various times.</v>

1783
01:31:16.561 --> 01:31:19.200
<v Speaker 3>Now we need much more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1784
01:31:19.330 --> 01:31:20.163
<v Speaker 3>so in the work of Finn and with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope your other colleagues around the </v>

1785
01:31:23.251 --> 01:31:28.050
<v Speaker 3>country that you will join the voices of</v>
<v Speaker 3>those who do speak,</v>

1786
01:31:28.051 --> 01:31:32.310
<v Speaker 3>I think responsibly and sensibly about </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1787
01:31:32.510 --> 01:31:33.343
<v Speaker 3>and for the a boat and for the oceans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that you will take these kinds of </v>

1788
01:31:37.531 --> 01:31:38.364
<v Speaker 3>broader perspectives and keep those in </v>
<v Speaker 3>mind even as you focus very strongly on </v>

1789
01:31:43.080 --> 01:31:43.913
<v Speaker 3>underneath for going after the </v>
<v Speaker 3>individual species and looking at the </v>

1790
01:31:46.651 --> 01:31:50.460
<v Speaker 3>problems related to all of the fish that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are out in the ocean.</v>

1791
01:31:50.850 --> 01:31:51.683
<v Speaker 3>Because it's clear we're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>eating more varieties of them and we're </v>

1792
01:31:55.981 --> 01:31:58.470
<v Speaker 3>going to find some very scarce still in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the future.</v>

1793
01:31:59.020 --> 01:32:01.030
<v Speaker 3>So thank you very much for your </v>
<v Speaker 3>attention this evening.</v>

1794
01:32:01.150 --> 01:32:06.150
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

1795
01:32:14.930 --> 01:32:17.030
<v Speaker 3>how'd your attention for a long time </v>
<v Speaker 3>tonight?</v>

1796
01:32:17.390 --> 01:32:19.620
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

1797
01:32:20.660 --> 01:32:23.240
<v Speaker 3>but you're welcome to ask questions if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd like to do that.</v>

1798
01:32:23.241 --> 01:32:24.770
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you ask a question,</v>

1799
01:32:24.771 --> 01:32:27.260
<v Speaker 3>then I'll repeat it because then we can </v>
<v Speaker 3>capture it on video,</v>

1800
01:32:27.920 --> 01:32:30.230
<v Speaker 3>but he'd be more than pleased to take </v>
<v Speaker 3>questions.</v>

1801
01:32:30.231 --> 01:32:35.231
<v Speaker 3>So if anyone has one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1802
01:32:35.480 --> 01:32:37.730
<v Speaker 3>Just the general problem of </v>
<v Speaker 3>sustainability.</v>

1803
01:32:38.180 --> 01:32:43.120
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if anyone's heard of Donald</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wright's idea of a progress draw.</v>

1804
01:32:43.670 --> 01:32:47.840
<v Speaker 3>So like our ancestors killing two </v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes,</v>

1805
01:32:47.841 --> 01:32:50.330
<v Speaker 3>let's say over one is a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's progress.</v>

1806
01:32:50.660 --> 01:32:51.493
<v Speaker 3>But once they could drive 200 off a </v>
<v Speaker 3>cliff and kill an entire herd and then </v>

1807
01:32:55.431 --> 01:32:56.264
<v Speaker 3>like he'll more herds until they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all our ancestors in those areas would </v>

1808
01:32:59.631 --> 01:33:01.850
<v Speaker 3>starve to death because they'd kill all </v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes essentially.</v>

1809
01:33:02.260 --> 01:33:03.720
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be progress drop.</v>

1810
01:33:03.800 --> 01:33:06.290
<v Speaker 3>What a book from dawn [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was wondering,</v>

1811
01:33:06.291 --> 01:33:07.124
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you guys have any thoughts about if </v>

1812
01:33:09.171 --> 01:33:10.004
<v Speaker 3>that applies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that's like an oversimplistic </v>

1813
01:33:11.690 --> 01:33:14.580
<v Speaker 3>generalization or if it fits it.</v>

1814
01:33:14.590 --> 01:33:15.423
<v Speaker 3>Is there anything that you do about it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the question is whether the idea of </v>

1815
01:33:18.691 --> 01:33:19.524
<v Speaker 3>progress trap is relevant to this issue </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a progress trapped is the expansion </v>

1816
01:33:23.551 --> 01:33:27.360
<v Speaker 3>of technology to harvest beyond </v>
<v Speaker 3>sustainable limits,</v>

1817
01:33:27.510 --> 01:33:29.220
<v Speaker 3>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you want to take that?</v>

1818
01:33:29.250 --> 01:33:30.260
<v Speaker 3>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

1819
01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:31.230
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1820
01:33:31.231 --> 01:33:32.064
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's part of a larger problem of traps </v>

1821
01:33:34.530 --> 01:33:38.550
<v Speaker 3>and progress traps is certainly one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we get caught in those traps because</v>

1822
01:33:38.551 --> 01:33:41.490
<v Speaker 3>something works well for us for at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time hearing.</v>

1823
01:33:41.610 --> 01:33:43.410
<v Speaker 3>And Sonia was true in the fisheries </v>
<v Speaker 3>case.</v>

1824
01:33:43.890 --> 01:33:48.890
<v Speaker 3>And then when it doesn't work well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're still adhering to that approach.</v>

1825
01:33:49.770 --> 01:33:50.603
<v Speaker 3>So one of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is one of the reasons why I </v>

1826
01:33:52.141 --> 01:33:54.270
<v Speaker 3>bring up the ecosystem work and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>forth,</v>

1827
01:33:54.630 --> 01:33:58.590
<v Speaker 3>we have to open our mind to alternative </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibilities.</v>

1828
01:33:58.650 --> 01:33:59.483
<v Speaker 3>And also there's another little phrase </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you is called the option for </v>

1829
01:34:01.930 --> 01:34:03.380
<v Speaker 3>closure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1830
01:34:03.440 --> 01:34:03.961
<v Speaker 3>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1831
01:34:03.961 --> 01:34:06.210
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you lay out all the different uses in</v>

1832
01:34:06.211 --> 01:34:07.720
<v Speaker 3>the ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1833
01:34:08.010 --> 01:34:10.710
<v Speaker 3>and everybody's scrambling for space in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ocean,</v>

1834
01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:11.633
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fishermen don't want aquaculture </v>

1835
01:34:12.721 --> 01:34:15.420
<v Speaker 3>because they can't park their boats or </v>
<v Speaker 3>their nets are in the way,</v>

1836
01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:16.890
<v Speaker 3>whatever it happens to be.</v>

1837
01:34:17.010 --> 01:34:17.843
<v Speaker 3>The oil people want one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The aquaculture is don't want to do old </v>

1838
01:34:19.971 --> 01:34:20.804
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>et cetera.</v>

1839
01:34:20.970 --> 01:34:23.910
<v Speaker 3>So you've got to have some rational case</v>
<v Speaker 3>for making choices,</v>

1840
01:34:24.210 --> 01:34:26.640
<v Speaker 3>but option for closure if you do it </v>
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

1841
01:34:26.940 --> 01:34:28.920
<v Speaker 3>And zoning is one of the ways to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1842
01:34:29.180 --> 01:34:31.320
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>allows for more to go on,</v>

1843
01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:32.633
<v Speaker 3>but at a lower risk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what we're doing now I think is </v>

1844
01:34:35.731 --> 01:34:36.564
<v Speaker 3>moving back towards a sectoral approach </v>
<v Speaker 3>where it happens right now that the </v>

1845
01:34:40.921 --> 01:34:44.080
<v Speaker 3>sector happens to be oil and gas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could equally be some other sector,</v>

1846
01:34:44.120 --> 01:34:47.370
<v Speaker 3>the could be deep ocean mining for </v>
<v Speaker 3>example,</v>

1847
01:34:47.371 --> 01:34:49.410
<v Speaker 3>or shallow ocean mining.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1848
01:34:49.470 --> 01:34:50.303
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so we have to have a more rational </v>

1849
01:34:52.951 --> 01:34:57.620
<v Speaker 3>basis and just following whatever we </v>
<v Speaker 3>think at the moment is the best know.</v>

1850
01:34:57.920 --> 01:34:58.670
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1851
01:34:58.670 --> 01:34:59.503
<v Speaker 3>so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's really dealing with the progress </v>

1852
01:35:00.531 --> 01:35:01.690
<v Speaker 3>trap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1853
01:35:01.940 --> 01:35:04.990
<v Speaker 3>I think there's also a kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and maybe the company said,</v>

1854
01:35:05.270 --> 01:35:08.060
<v Speaker 3>but it kind of a conceptual trap </v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes as well.</v>

1855
01:35:08.090 --> 01:35:08.923
<v Speaker 3>And our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

1856
01:35:08.930 --> 01:35:12.350
<v Speaker 3>we adhere to ideas and therefore wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>open our minds up,</v>

1857
01:35:12.620 --> 01:35:16.700
<v Speaker 3>but then something comes along.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could be some terrible accident,</v>

1858
01:35:17.100 --> 01:35:18.580
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the classic cases,</v>

1859
01:35:18.590 --> 01:35:21.320
<v Speaker 3>the Exxon Valdez or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And suddenly,</v>

1860
01:35:21.321 --> 01:35:22.154
<v Speaker 3>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in a whole new environment of </v>

1861
01:35:23.841 --> 01:35:27.380
<v Speaker 3>thinking and you're not prepared for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have solutions.</v>

1862
01:35:27.381 --> 01:35:28.214
<v Speaker 3>You don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>haven't thought your way through the </v>

1863
01:35:29.541 --> 01:35:30.374
<v Speaker 3>kind of knowledge basis you need.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's another kind of trap that </v>

1864
01:35:33.651 --> 01:35:37.190
<v Speaker 3>we have to face because that's why I say</v>
<v Speaker 3>think about accidents.</v>

1865
01:35:37.790 --> 01:35:42.140
<v Speaker 3>Many of the changes in our society are </v>
<v Speaker 3>the result of accidents and something so</v>

1866
01:35:42.141 --> 01:35:45.620
<v Speaker 3>awful happens that we have to think of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>new way of doing things.</v>

1867
01:35:45.950 --> 01:35:46.783
<v Speaker 3>And so a lot of what I think of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientific community is dealing with in </v>

1868
01:35:52.311 --> 01:35:56.780
<v Speaker 3>the oceans right now is to say we've got</v>
<v Speaker 3>to prepare ourselves for a future that's</v>

1869
01:35:56.781 --> 01:35:57.614
<v Speaker 3>very uncertain and therefore we need to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a lot of knowledge and we have to </v>

1870
01:36:01.580 --> 01:36:05.330
<v Speaker 3>ask a lot of what ifs so that we are </v>
<v Speaker 3>prepared to make um,</v>

1871
01:36:05.390 --> 01:36:07.610
<v Speaker 3>direction shifts as necessary in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>future.</v>

1872
01:36:07.611 --> 01:36:08.444
<v Speaker 3>Whether they're from climate change or </v>
<v Speaker 3>some horrible accident or just changing </v>

1873
01:36:11.631 --> 01:36:16.190
<v Speaker 3>priorities and society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of those priorities for sure is that</v>

1874
01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:19.820
<v Speaker 3>all those certification programs are </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to become the way we do business.</v>

1875
01:36:20.210 --> 01:36:23.390
<v Speaker 3>And those people who are not engaged in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1876
01:36:23.391 --> 01:36:24.890
<v Speaker 3>in the fisheries are going to learn the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hard way.</v>

1877
01:36:25.100 --> 01:36:27.170
<v Speaker 3>That's my prediction for five to 10 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

1878
01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:34.480
<v Speaker 5>What would be the negative consequences,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially economic consequences,</v>

1879
01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:40.360
<v Speaker 5>the loss of jobs or those mysteries.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'll let some of those fee.</v>

1880
01:36:41.160 --> 01:36:44.400
<v Speaker 3>The question is the negative potential </v>
<v Speaker 3>negative consequences of zoning?</v>

1881
01:36:45.700 --> 01:36:46.351
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1882
01:36:46.351 --> 01:36:48.030
<v Speaker 3>it's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really good question.</v>

1883
01:36:48.540 --> 01:36:49.373
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well to start with it is if you impose </v>

1884
01:36:54.360 --> 01:36:55.193
<v Speaker 3>zoning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost certainly going to have a </v>

1885
01:36:56.941 --> 01:36:57.774
<v Speaker 3>lot of negative consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of which is people simply won't </v>

1886
01:37:00.091 --> 01:37:04.170
<v Speaker 3>accept it and therefore the illegal </v>
<v Speaker 3>activities will take a,</v>

1887
01:37:04.230 --> 01:37:05.063
<v Speaker 3>so the first thing about zoning is it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>gotta be done on a consultative and </v>

1888
01:37:08.850 --> 01:37:11.400
<v Speaker 3>collegial and some conclusions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the wrong word,</v>

1889
01:37:11.401 --> 01:37:14.670
<v Speaker 3>collaborative way and bringing </v>
<v Speaker 3>stakeholders together.</v>

1890
01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:16.830
<v Speaker 3>That's essential.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise,</v>

1891
01:37:16.920 --> 01:37:19.350
<v Speaker 3>there's all sorts of ways around zoning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1892
01:37:19.351 --> 01:37:21.380
<v Speaker 3>the second thing about zoning is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1893
01:37:22.380 --> 01:37:23.213
<v Speaker 3>if there are economic trade offs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one has to look at that carefully </v>

1894
01:37:28.290 --> 01:37:29.123
<v Speaker 3>because there may be ways to avoid them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you don't look at the economics </v>

1895
01:37:31.951 --> 01:37:32.784
<v Speaker 3>carefully,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you can do really dumb things with </v>

1896
01:37:34.471 --> 01:37:35.304
<v Speaker 3>economic zone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The third thing is if you're going to </v>

1897
01:37:37.591 --> 01:37:42.480
<v Speaker 3>make an assertion like we have both made</v>
<v Speaker 3>tonight that we think Mbas,</v>

1898
01:37:42.780 --> 01:37:43.613
<v Speaker 3>which is a type of zoning can be helpful</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the overall issue of fisheries </v>

1899
01:37:47.341 --> 01:37:48.174
<v Speaker 3>management.</v>

1900
01:37:48.690 --> 01:37:51.750
<v Speaker 3>Eventually maybe we can get away with </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying that for a number of years,</v>

1901
01:37:51.751 --> 01:37:52.584
<v Speaker 3>maybe even decades.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eventually we've got to show the </v>

1902
01:37:54.061 --> 01:37:54.894
<v Speaker 3>results.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there to be a lot of monitoring and </v>

1903
01:37:56.461 --> 01:37:58.590
<v Speaker 3>so forth as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise,</v>

1904
01:37:59.130 --> 01:38:01.170
<v Speaker 3>it's your word against my word,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so to speak.</v>

1905
01:38:01.800 --> 01:38:04.590
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so those are some of the consequences on</v>

1906
01:38:04.591 --> 01:38:07.620
<v Speaker 3>the positive side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you do things right with zoning,</v>

1907
01:38:07.830 --> 01:38:10.740
<v Speaker 3>you can actually get added value.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can have,</v>

1908
01:38:11.260 --> 01:38:13.800
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well give you an example.</v>

1909
01:38:14.070 --> 01:38:17.280
<v Speaker 3>There was a full page ad in the paper,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1910
01:38:17.340 --> 01:38:19.350
<v Speaker 3>in and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1911
01:38:19.530 --> 01:38:20.363
<v Speaker 3>British Columbia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was probably a number of the </v>

1912
01:38:21.211 --> 01:38:26.211
<v Speaker 3>papers by a group of people in engaged </v>
<v Speaker 3>in marine tourism on the discovery,</v>

1913
01:38:28.950 --> 01:38:30.360
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somme area,</v>

1914
01:38:30.540 --> 01:38:35.540
<v Speaker 3>which is up the coast a little ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the point was in this case that they</v>

1915
01:38:35.551 --> 01:38:36.384
<v Speaker 3>feared a bunch of clear cutting there </v>
<v Speaker 3>was going to totally destroy or largely </v>

1916
01:38:39.841 --> 01:38:41.520
<v Speaker 3>destroyed the potential for tourism.</v>

1917
01:38:42.090 --> 01:38:43.620
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1918
01:38:43.830 --> 01:38:44.663
<v Speaker 3>you zone that you don't let that happen </v>
<v Speaker 3>or do you just let it happen while </v>

1919
01:38:49.141 --> 01:38:53.430
<v Speaker 3>they've got the rights to clear cutting </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the people are saying,</v>

1920
01:38:53.431 --> 01:38:54.810
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to lose their livelihoods.</v>

1921
01:38:55.020 --> 01:38:57.090
<v Speaker 3>People aren't going to want to come up </v>
<v Speaker 3>and see clear cuts.</v>

1922
01:38:57.440 --> 01:38:58.273
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so those are things that if you do get </v>

1923
01:39:00.781 --> 01:39:01.614
<v Speaker 3>together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's probably a good solution and </v>

1924
01:39:04.170 --> 01:39:08.130
<v Speaker 3>everybody gives at the end of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's probably a solution.</v>

1925
01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:09.073
<v Speaker 3>It's the same as that example between </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I gave of the whales going and </v>

1926
01:39:11.850 --> 01:39:12.683
<v Speaker 3>avoiding that ship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Legends for years there was resistance </v>

1927
01:39:14.521 --> 01:39:17.070
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's going to be shifts crashing into</v>

1928
01:39:17.071 --> 01:39:18.870
<v Speaker 3>each other and all sorts of things or it</v>
<v Speaker 3>won't work,</v>

1929
01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:20.940
<v Speaker 3>work perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1930
01:39:20.941 --> 01:39:22.320
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that was the zoning one.</v>

1931
01:39:22.321 --> 01:39:23.154
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so look for the positive side of it and </v>

1932
01:39:25.650 --> 01:39:28.890
<v Speaker 3>anticipate if there are negative things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can they be addressed?</v>

1933
01:39:32.130 --> 01:39:32.963
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1934
01:39:32.980 --> 01:39:35.190
<v Speaker 5>just from the point of view of an </v>
<v Speaker 5>organization like Finn,</v>

1935
01:39:36.340 --> 01:39:37.360
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1936
01:39:37.660 --> 01:39:40.180
<v Speaker 5>I read that the eye you use,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1937
01:39:40.510 --> 01:39:41.343
<v Speaker 5>also engage in a lot of odious behaviors</v>
<v Speaker 5>that aren't necessarily related to what </v>

1938
01:39:44.231 --> 01:39:45.520
<v Speaker 5>you talked about tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1939
01:39:45.870 --> 01:39:47.890
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>human trafficking drugs now,</v>

1940
01:39:47.891 --> 01:39:49.360
<v Speaker 5>that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm just wondering,</v>

1941
01:39:49.450 --> 01:39:50.500
<v Speaker 5>in order to help,</v>

1942
01:39:51.270 --> 01:39:52.103
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1943
01:39:53.630 --> 01:39:56.090
<v Speaker 5>give the issue more political </v>
<v Speaker 5>prominence,</v>

1944
01:39:56.180 --> 01:39:59.960
<v Speaker 5>is there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you see linkages possible or possibly</v>

1945
01:39:59.961 --> 01:40:04.250
<v Speaker 5>between this issue and others that </v>
<v Speaker 5>people that other groups or other people</v>

1946
01:40:04.251 --> 01:40:04.941
<v Speaker 5>make,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1947
01:40:04.941 --> 01:40:08.870
<v Speaker 5>sort of considered to be sort of trigger</v>
<v Speaker 5>ideas if you understand the question?</v>

1948
01:40:09.300 --> 01:40:10.920
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so the question is,</v>

1949
01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:11.873
<v Speaker 5>given that there are illegal fishing </v>
<v Speaker 5>activities in that those illegal </v>

1950
01:40:15.061 --> 01:40:19.230
<v Speaker 5>activities spill into other domains of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the illegality light,</v>

1951
01:40:19.260 --> 01:40:21.450
<v Speaker 5>perhaps drug trafficking and human </v>
<v Speaker 5>trafficking,</v>

1952
01:40:21.780 --> 01:40:25.170
<v Speaker 5>are there ways of making political </v>
<v Speaker 5>capital out of those connections?</v>

1953
01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:28.670
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's interesting that the,</v>

1954
01:40:28.671 --> 01:40:29.361
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you you,</v>

1955
01:40:29.361 --> 01:40:30.194
<v Speaker 3>and I think that's relatively new,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that people have been trying to make </v>

1956
01:40:32.361 --> 01:40:35.330
<v Speaker 3>those linkages even though we've known </v>
<v Speaker 3>that there are linkages.</v>

1957
01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:38.150
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I th I think,</v>

1958
01:40:38.151 --> 01:40:40.280
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the answer in quick answer is yes,</v>

1959
01:40:40.820 --> 01:40:43.230
<v Speaker 3>but it has to be done very carefully.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1960
01:40:43.700 --> 01:40:44.533
<v Speaker 3>and it has to be done on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has to be evidence based and it has </v>

1961
01:40:47.991 --> 01:40:48.824
<v Speaker 3>to be done not just at a kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>global thinking level or won't lead and </v>

1962
01:40:51.581 --> 01:40:55.010
<v Speaker 3>where it has to be God down a very </v>
<v Speaker 3>serious things.</v>

1963
01:40:55.030 --> 01:40:56.810
<v Speaker 3>To give you one example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1964
01:40:57.310 --> 01:41:00.760
<v Speaker 3>in the 1980s,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1965
01:41:01.150 --> 01:41:06.150
<v Speaker 3>the fisheries industry and south of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Thailand really went into decline and it</v>

1966
01:41:07.211 --> 01:41:08.044
<v Speaker 3>was fish docks if been over fishing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>all they could catch her jellyfish and </v>

1967
01:41:11.470 --> 01:41:13.000
<v Speaker 3>squid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1968
01:41:13.300 --> 01:41:14.133
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's thousands of boats and so </v>

1969
01:41:15.971 --> 01:41:16.804
<v Speaker 3>many of them turned into predatory </v>
<v Speaker 3>action against the Vietnamese refugees </v>

1970
01:41:19.931 --> 01:41:21.100
<v Speaker 3>coming out of Vietnam.</v>

1971
01:41:21.580 --> 01:41:23.320
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was a terrible situation,</v>

1972
01:41:23.321 --> 01:41:24.920
<v Speaker 3>really awful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1973
01:41:25.210 --> 01:41:28.570
<v Speaker 3>well one of the things that happened was</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1974
01:41:29.590 --> 01:41:30.850
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thailand,</v>

1975
01:41:31.540 --> 01:41:33.880
<v Speaker 3>which was very concerned and the rest of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world was as well,</v>

1976
01:41:34.180 --> 01:41:38.570
<v Speaker 3>but tyler and decided that they would </v>
<v Speaker 3>take on the function of turning the,</v>

1977
01:41:38.580 --> 01:41:39.413
<v Speaker 3>this past industry into a processing </v>
<v Speaker 3>industry for the world's tuna and </v>

1978
01:41:43.361 --> 01:41:44.194
<v Speaker 3>successfully managed to build a whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>new industrial basis around taking </v>

1979
01:41:48.101 --> 01:41:49.780
<v Speaker 3>frozen tuna from everywhere in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

1980
01:41:49.781 --> 01:41:50.614
<v Speaker 3>So if you look at all your canned to </v>
<v Speaker 3>interview happened to eat tuna that </v>

1981
01:41:53.770 --> 01:41:54.603
<v Speaker 3>you'll find most of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's been that Camden and Thailand ever </v>

1982
01:41:57.341 --> 01:41:58.174
<v Speaker 3>since.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it created a new industry as it at </v>

1983
01:42:00.851 --> 01:42:01.684
<v Speaker 3>least picked up some of the jobs and got</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of a lot of the illegal other </v>

1984
01:42:05.411 --> 01:42:06.244
<v Speaker 3>activities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And including a lot of the illegal </v>

1985
01:42:07.841 --> 01:42:08.674
<v Speaker 3>fisheries activities because of the ties</v>
<v Speaker 3>were also going off into Indonesian </v>

1986
01:42:11.201 --> 01:42:13.600
<v Speaker 3>waters and elsewhere and just savaging,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1987
01:42:13.950 --> 01:42:16.270
<v Speaker 3>this fish docks there in terms of stocks</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so forth.</v>

1988
01:42:16.660 --> 01:42:18.760
<v Speaker 3>So there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there can be solutions to that.</v>

1989
01:42:19.300 --> 01:42:24.160
<v Speaker 3>I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on this iau you thing it's a huge issue.</v>

1990
01:42:24.550 --> 01:42:27.560
<v Speaker 3>FAO has been very useful on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1991
01:42:27.610 --> 01:42:30.190
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of countries are now buying in</v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

1992
01:42:30.300 --> 01:42:31.133
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a very good way including many </v>

1993
01:42:32.470 --> 01:42:35.680
<v Speaker 3>developing nations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we're making progress on it,</v>

1994
01:42:36.100 --> 01:42:36.933
<v Speaker 3>but as a long way to go still.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so anything that can link it to the </v>

1995
01:42:39.971 --> 01:42:40.804
<v Speaker 3>other illegal activities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of which are very audience to </v>

1996
01:42:42.551 --> 01:42:43.890
<v Speaker 3>countries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1997
01:42:44.170 --> 01:42:45.010
<v Speaker 3>that would be helpful.</v>

1998
01:42:50.700 --> 01:42:51.533
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>aggressive activism like a sea shepherd </v>

1999
01:42:54.810 --> 01:42:58.140
<v Speaker 3>can be positive or do you think that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's counter productive?</v>

2000
01:42:59.130 --> 01:43:03.360
<v Speaker 3>The question is whether aggressive </v>
<v Speaker 3>action like that of the sea shepherd can</v>

2001
01:43:03.361 --> 01:43:06.400
<v Speaker 3>be productive for with her overall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's counter row.</v>

2002
01:43:07.500 --> 01:43:09.180
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a personal view on this.</v>

2003
01:43:10.170 --> 01:43:11.003
<v Speaker 3>My personal view,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is I think a agreed upon by at </v>

2004
01:43:12.991 --> 01:43:13.824
<v Speaker 3>least some of my colleagues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not everybody is that we need a number </v>

2005
01:43:16.801 --> 01:43:20.680
<v Speaker 3>of different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is a war that's being fought and,</v>

2006
01:43:21.070 --> 01:43:21.903
<v Speaker 3>and sea shepherd is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is fighting actively on some fronts </v>

2007
01:43:26.941 --> 01:43:31.560
<v Speaker 3>where others fear to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we need people who are on the front,</v>

2008
01:43:31.561 --> 01:43:34.230
<v Speaker 3>whether it's Greenpeace,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's a sea shepherd,</v>

2009
01:43:34.620 --> 01:43:36.810
<v Speaker 3>whether it's people who are milder and </v>
<v Speaker 3>their actions,</v>

2010
01:43:36.811 --> 01:43:37.860
<v Speaker 3>but still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2011
01:43:38.010 --> 01:43:40.800
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the case of Sierra Club,</v>

2012
01:43:40.860 --> 01:43:41.693
<v Speaker 3>no taking a harder stance decided which </v>
<v Speaker 3>might include some actions that are not </v>

2013
01:43:45.931 --> 01:43:46.764
<v Speaker 3>very nice but not on the level of going </v>
<v Speaker 3>out and ramping ships or whatever that </v>

2014
01:43:50.200 --> 01:43:51.620
<v Speaker 3>of sea shepherd has been accused of.</v>

2015
01:43:52.150 --> 01:43:52.983
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that there's a wide spectrum of </v>

2016
01:43:56.571 --> 01:43:59.660
<v Speaker 3>things are needed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of which are on that far end.</v>

2017
01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:04.820
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want people to be injured in the</v>

2018
01:44:04.821 --> 01:44:09.680
<v Speaker 3>process,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're making a point in a dramatic</v>

2019
01:44:09.681 --> 01:44:13.070
<v Speaker 3>way that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that others cannot make.</v>

2020
01:44:13.640 --> 01:44:16.160
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then there are the people that,</v>

2021
01:44:16.161 --> 01:44:17.740
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2022
01:44:18.430 --> 01:44:22.400
<v Speaker 3>that go out and there's lots of them go </v>
<v Speaker 3>out and make movies.</v>

2023
01:44:22.430 --> 01:44:23.263
<v Speaker 3>They go out and do active research with </v>
<v Speaker 3>money that's raised for their cause and </v>

2024
01:44:28.341 --> 01:44:30.400
<v Speaker 3>then the many of the NGO's fallenness </v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2025
01:44:30.410 --> 01:44:32.660
<v Speaker 3>and so they're not going that far,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's still,</v>

2026
01:44:32.960 --> 01:44:33.793
<v Speaker 3>there's still activist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>highly activists and they're going out </v>

2027
01:44:36.051 --> 01:44:36.884
<v Speaker 3>and they're looking at the problems </v>
<v Speaker 3>locally and internationally and so </v>

2028
01:44:39.381 --> 01:44:41.360
<v Speaker 3>forth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're valuable.</v>

2029
01:44:42.770 --> 01:44:47.150
<v Speaker 3>There's people like myself that have </v>
<v Speaker 3>chosen to work closer to government.</v>

2030
01:44:47.420 --> 01:44:49.280
<v Speaker 3>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2031
01:44:49.281 --> 01:44:50.114
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to believe that I understand </v>
<v Speaker 3>some things about science and I want to </v>

2032
01:44:53.631 --> 01:44:55.580
<v Speaker 3>see that translated into public policy.</v>

2033
01:44:56.030 --> 01:45:00.490
<v Speaker 3>If I ever went out and did something </v>
<v Speaker 3>like Seasha,</v>

2034
01:45:00.500 --> 01:45:01.333
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I certainly wouldn't be welcome in some </v>

2035
01:45:02.121 --> 01:45:05.420
<v Speaker 3>of the circles that I traveled with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with government people or whatever.</v>

2036
01:45:05.750 --> 01:45:06.583
<v Speaker 3>So you make choices.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there are scientists that </v>

2037
01:45:09.080 --> 01:45:10.130
<v Speaker 3>often,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2038
01:45:10.310 --> 01:45:12.770
<v Speaker 3>want to remain very close to their </v>
<v Speaker 3>science,</v>

2039
01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:13.873
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it happens to be and would </v>

2040
01:45:15.411 --> 01:45:20.120
<v Speaker 3>prefer to bring that information freely </v>
<v Speaker 3>and well out to the public and so forth,</v>

2041
01:45:20.121 --> 01:45:22.640
<v Speaker 3>but not be the front liners themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2042
01:45:22.641 --> 01:45:24.650
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then there's others as well.</v>

2043
01:45:24.970 --> 01:45:27.380
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also believe in the power of one,</v>

2044
01:45:27.590 --> 01:45:29.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>individuals like the school teacher.</v>

2045
01:45:29.631 --> 01:45:31.970
<v Speaker 3>And the whales in Nova Scotia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2046
01:45:32.300 --> 01:45:37.300
<v Speaker 3>that was just an ordinary school teacher</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a small rural school district who did</v>

2047
01:45:37.911 --> 01:45:41.060
<v Speaker 3>something that was really very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very valuable at the time.</v>

2048
01:45:42.020 --> 01:45:45.800
<v Speaker 3>And we can find many other examples.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could tell you dozens of stories.</v>

2049
01:45:46.250 --> 01:45:48.180
<v Speaker 3>There's people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2050
01:45:48.830 --> 01:45:52.130
<v Speaker 3>an organization that deals with </v>
<v Speaker 3>fisheries management.</v>

2051
01:45:52.150 --> 01:45:52.983
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a collective sort of basis and the </v>

2052
01:45:54.621 --> 01:45:57.920
<v Speaker 3>west coast of Vancouver Island.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they stick their necks out.</v>

2053
01:45:58.040 --> 01:45:58.873
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they work collectively between first </v>

2054
01:45:59.961 --> 01:46:01.190
<v Speaker 3>nations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2055
01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:03.890
<v Speaker 3>and with governments,</v>
<v Speaker 3>federal,</v>

2056
01:46:03.891 --> 01:46:04.724
<v Speaker 3>provincial to support,</v>
<v Speaker 3>supported from a variety of different </v>

2057
01:46:05.811 --> 01:46:06.644
<v Speaker 3>sources.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they manage a lot of species that </v>

2058
01:46:08.361 --> 01:46:10.640
<v Speaker 3>are not the big flashy salmon or so </v>
<v Speaker 3>forth,</v>

2059
01:46:10.670 --> 01:46:11.503
<v Speaker 3>but other things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're making progress in setting </v>

2060
01:46:14.031 --> 01:46:16.370
<v Speaker 3>the basis for a new form of fisheries </v>
<v Speaker 3>management.</v>

2061
01:46:16.740 --> 01:46:17.750
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's tough.</v>

2062
01:46:17.780 --> 01:46:18.613
<v Speaker 3>Let me tell you how tough it is because </v>
<v Speaker 3>I've looked at this organization quite </v>

2063
01:46:21.171 --> 01:46:22.580
<v Speaker 3>closely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2064
01:46:22.610 --> 01:46:23.331
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2065
01:46:23.331 --> 01:46:24.164
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we need people that are activists in </v>

2066
01:46:26.211 --> 01:46:27.820
<v Speaker 3>different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2067
01:46:27.980 --> 01:46:30.590
<v Speaker 3>we need people that are educators.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need researchers,</v>

2068
01:46:31.010 --> 01:46:32.630
<v Speaker 3>whole range.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>

2069
01:46:32.631 --> 01:46:33.590
<v Speaker 3>I do think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2070
01:46:33.710 --> 01:46:34.543
<v Speaker 3>I must admit that I have a higher degree</v>
<v Speaker 3>of respect for Paul Watson than many </v>

2071
01:46:40.041 --> 01:46:42.830
<v Speaker 3>people might have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's,</v>

2072
01:46:42.890 --> 01:46:44.070
<v Speaker 3>he's shown us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

2073
01:46:44.071 --> 01:46:46.160
<v Speaker 3>Sean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of light into some very,</v>

2074
01:46:46.161 --> 01:46:47.180
<v Speaker 3>very dark corners.</v>

2075
01:46:51.940 --> 01:46:52.773
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I kind of have this legal and the </v>

2076
01:46:54.321 --> 01:46:57.960
<v Speaker 5>same question I'm interested in how we </v>
<v Speaker 5>could introduce this.</v>

2077
01:46:58.320 --> 01:47:02.880
<v Speaker 5>How can I extract something on a more </v>
<v Speaker 5>daily interaction that we have,</v>

2078
01:47:03.330 --> 01:47:06.890
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like choosing the better flavor or a,</v>

2079
01:47:06.970 --> 01:47:10.200
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are there any maybe way of like,</v>

2080
01:47:10.201 --> 01:47:12.570
<v Speaker 5>because with food on land,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you know,</v>

2081
01:47:12.700 --> 01:47:14.430
<v Speaker 5>quality is an important aspect.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you can,</v>

2082
01:47:14.431 --> 01:47:15.264
<v Speaker 5>I guess you could take an individual to </v>
<v Speaker 5>a farm showing the process of what I </v>

2083
01:47:18.830 --> 01:47:22.080
<v Speaker 5>think of choice is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but how do you show something has this,</v>

2084
01:47:22.500 --> 01:47:26.550
<v Speaker 5>I mean we don't have the same connection</v>
<v Speaker 5>with the fish because we could.</v>

2085
01:47:26.630 --> 01:47:29.930
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So is there another way of educating and</v>

2086
01:47:29.970 --> 01:47:31.260
<v Speaker 5>what genuinely the public</v>

2087
01:47:31.670 --> 01:47:33.660
<v Speaker 3>wasn't?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He picked the first try,</v>

2088
01:47:33.670 --> 01:47:34.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

2089
01:47:34.240 --> 01:47:37.800
<v Speaker 3>you're a person who deals with </v>
<v Speaker 3>behavioral psychology sorts of things.</v>

2090
01:47:37.801 --> 01:47:38.634
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which of this is all about psychology </v>

2091
01:47:41.011 --> 01:47:44.080
<v Speaker 3>and behavior has been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well the question is consumerism.</v>

2092
01:47:44.190 --> 01:47:48.030
<v Speaker 3>What can you know what can be done to </v>
<v Speaker 3>link these issues to behavior on a,</v>

2093
01:47:48.470 --> 01:47:50.110
<v Speaker 3>at a local level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2094
01:47:51.930 --> 01:47:52.920
<v Speaker 3>you don't have something.</v>

2095
01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:54.193
<v Speaker 5>Maybe if there's like a project that you</v>
<v Speaker 5>have or there already is circulating </v>

2096
01:47:57.770 --> 01:47:59.780
<v Speaker 5>that maybe we can take people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

2097
01:47:59.820 --> 01:48:02.670
<v Speaker 5>he can be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because this is an intellectual talk how</v>

2098
01:48:02.671 --> 01:48:03.504
<v Speaker 5>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I can't really voice this </v>

2099
01:48:05.811 --> 01:48:10.190
<v Speaker 5>information process adequately.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So maybe if I can point individually.</v>

2100
01:48:10.570 --> 01:48:11.270
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2101
01:48:11.270 --> 01:48:12.103
<v Speaker 3>the only,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only real effective means of </v>

2102
01:48:14.710 --> 01:48:15.543
<v Speaker 3>changing individual behavior that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think would actually work is for people </v>

2103
01:48:18.941 --> 01:48:22.540
<v Speaker 3>to write their nps and the members of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the cabinet.</v>

2104
01:48:23.080 --> 01:48:23.913
<v Speaker 3>Because believe it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>politicians actually pay attention to </v>

2105
01:48:25.931 --> 01:48:26.764
<v Speaker 3>letters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so a lot of what we've talked about </v>

2106
01:48:30.130 --> 01:48:30.963
<v Speaker 3>tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially the marine protected areas </v>

2107
01:48:31.841 --> 01:48:36.340
<v Speaker 3>issue isn't going to be moved forward </v>
<v Speaker 3>unless the politician sense that there's</v>

2108
01:48:36.341 --> 01:48:39.160
<v Speaker 3>actual public demand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the frameworks already there,</v>

2109
01:48:39.161 --> 01:48:40.720
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've signed the treaties and so on.</v>

2110
01:48:40.721 --> 01:48:43.300
<v Speaker 3>But the way they're reading the </v>
<v Speaker 3>population is,</v>

2111
01:48:43.360 --> 01:48:44.193
<v Speaker 3>it's perfectly okay to ignore that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the only way to change that as far </v>

2112
01:48:48.521 --> 01:48:49.354
<v Speaker 3>as I can tell is to indicate that it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually not okay to ignore it because </v>

2113
01:48:53.441 --> 01:48:54.910
<v Speaker 3>right now it is okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2114
01:48:55.100 --> 01:48:58.930
<v Speaker 3>and that's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Our political system actually does work.</v>

2115
01:48:59.110 --> 01:48:59.943
<v Speaker 3>It's much more permeable than people </v>
<v Speaker 3>really think because in some ways it's </v>

2116
01:49:04.031 --> 01:49:05.680
<v Speaker 3>left to its own devices.</v>

2117
01:49:05.710 --> 01:49:06.543
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most people don't really participate in </v>

2118
01:49:08.111 --> 01:49:11.050
<v Speaker 3>the political system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it leaves it in the hands of the very</v>

2119
01:49:11.051 --> 01:49:11.884
<v Speaker 3>small minority who do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's surprisingly permeable if </v>

2120
01:49:15.401 --> 01:49:18.760
<v Speaker 3>you're interested in permeating it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so while that's,</v>

2121
01:49:18.761 --> 01:49:20.750
<v Speaker 3>that's my take,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least at the political level,</v>

2122
01:49:21.280 --> 01:49:22.170
<v Speaker 3>that's one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2123
01:49:22.230 --> 01:49:24.130
<v Speaker 3>let,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me give you four or five things that</v>

2124
01:49:24.131 --> 01:49:25.940
<v Speaker 3>I think are really useful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2125
01:49:26.440 --> 01:49:27.520
<v Speaker 3>one is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2126
01:49:27.530 --> 01:49:29.120
<v Speaker 3>if you have the trust in them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2127
01:49:29.180 --> 01:49:30.013
<v Speaker 3>these seafood guides are very helpful </v>
<v Speaker 3>and so you can use those in your own </v>

2128
01:49:34.481 --> 01:49:36.670
<v Speaker 3>personal life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you go into a restaurant,</v>

2129
01:49:37.160 --> 01:49:39.460
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ask them has this,</v>

2130
01:49:39.550 --> 01:49:42.910
<v Speaker 3>and if you happen to enjoy fish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ask them,</v>

2131
01:49:43.360 --> 01:49:45.520
<v Speaker 3>tell me about this fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is a species?</v>

2132
01:49:45.820 --> 01:49:48.340
<v Speaker 3>Where was it captured from?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2133
01:49:48.790 --> 01:49:51.850
<v Speaker 3>what is it certified fish that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>serving?</v>

2134
01:49:52.690 --> 01:49:54.490
<v Speaker 3>Ask the chef to come out and talk to </v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

2135
01:49:54.670 --> 01:49:55.503
<v Speaker 3>I've done that.</v>

2136
01:49:55.820 --> 01:49:56.331
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2137
01:49:56.331 --> 01:50:01.331
<v Speaker 3>and go in if you use an ipad or an </v>
<v Speaker 3>iphone and challenge them on some things</v>

2138
01:50:02.681 --> 01:50:04.120
<v Speaker 3>when they say they don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2139
01:50:04.121 --> 01:50:04.954
<v Speaker 3>there's no information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I did this once in a very </v>

2140
01:50:08.411 --> 01:50:10.600
<v Speaker 3>respectable restaurant in Vancouver and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I warned them,</v>

2141
01:50:10.601 --> 01:50:11.081
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2142
01:50:11.081 --> 01:50:14.340
<v Speaker 3>I'm bringing a group of people who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>leaders in this whole seafood process.</v>

2143
01:50:14.350 --> 01:50:15.730
<v Speaker 3>They're going to have all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 3>questions.</v>

2144
01:50:16.030 --> 01:50:16.863
<v Speaker 3>So I brought my ipad was brand new in </v>
<v Speaker 3>those days and did this come out six </v>

2145
01:50:19.421 --> 01:50:20.254
<v Speaker 3>months before and we sat down and half </v>
<v Speaker 3>an hour by the time that the poor chefs </v>

2146
01:50:25.661 --> 01:50:26.494
<v Speaker 3>were sweating and let me tie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they answered all the questions </v>

2147
01:50:28.120 --> 01:50:28.953
<v Speaker 3>correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got all information and we got past </v>

2148
01:50:30.791 --> 01:50:31.624
<v Speaker 3>all these fancy names and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's what another way in dealing </v>

2149
01:50:34.871 --> 01:50:37.510
<v Speaker 3>with the food industry do it at a </v>
<v Speaker 3>supermarket.</v>

2150
01:50:37.810 --> 01:50:42.040
<v Speaker 3>If you're not getting good answers right</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the president of the company and say,</v>

2151
01:50:42.041 --> 01:50:42.874
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in whatever chain had happened to </v>

2152
01:50:44.561 --> 01:50:45.394
<v Speaker 3>be local or national and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I could not get any answer above </v>

2153
01:50:48.521 --> 01:50:51.970
<v Speaker 3>whether the crowd that you're serving </v>
<v Speaker 3>with sustainably produced.</v>

2154
01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:56.500
<v Speaker 3>Can you tell me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if they can't go after them and say,</v>

2155
01:50:56.530 --> 01:50:57.570
<v Speaker 3>please,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really want to,</v>

2156
01:50:57.571 --> 01:50:58.404
<v Speaker 3>not an honest answer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'll bet you the answer and you'll </v>

2157
01:51:01.120 --> 01:51:04.000
<v Speaker 3>make your decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a third way is,</v>

2158
01:51:04.001 --> 01:51:04.834
<v Speaker 3>as you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go to the politicians and keep going to </v>

2159
01:51:06.761 --> 01:51:07.594
<v Speaker 3>the politicians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Find out who the politicians locally </v>

2160
01:51:09.821 --> 01:51:10.654
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the really have an interest in the </v>

2161
01:51:11.771 --> 01:51:12.604
<v Speaker 3>subject because there are little </v>
<v Speaker 3>clusters of people that don't get very </v>

2162
01:51:15.341 --> 01:51:17.830
<v Speaker 3>much support in both the Senate and in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the house.</v>

2163
01:51:18.070 --> 01:51:18.903
<v Speaker 3>There really are interested in they </v>
<v Speaker 3>cross party lines and some of these </v>

2164
01:51:20.891 --> 01:51:22.600
<v Speaker 3>things as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2165
01:51:22.630 --> 01:51:25.350
<v Speaker 3>and so that's another way of doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But go to this.</v>

2166
01:51:25.420 --> 01:51:28.210
<v Speaker 3>I think that unsustainable development </v>
<v Speaker 3>in general,</v>

2167
01:51:28.240 --> 01:51:29.073
<v Speaker 3>we have to go to the cities and what's </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything but Toronto and political </v>

2168
01:51:33.821 --> 01:51:36.490
<v Speaker 3>system right now and how much this would</v>
<v Speaker 3>come up to the top.</v>

2169
01:51:36.490 --> 01:51:39.740
<v Speaker 3>But I know certainly in the West Coast </v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

2170
01:51:39.760 --> 01:51:41.290
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of places in the east </v>
<v Speaker 3>coast,</v>

2171
01:51:41.291 --> 01:51:42.124
<v Speaker 3>it's very central.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People will talk about it to you and </v>

2172
01:51:44.261 --> 01:51:46.210
<v Speaker 3>they are the places where action is </v>
<v Speaker 3>taking,</v>

2173
01:51:46.690 --> 01:51:49.690
<v Speaker 3>taking on interesting approaches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2174
01:51:49.720 --> 01:51:50.553
<v Speaker 3>the next one is to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can only do this yourself by </v>

2175
01:51:55.450 --> 01:51:56.283
<v Speaker 3>looking at different organizations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>decide which organizations you're going </v>

2176
01:51:59.321 --> 01:52:00.154
<v Speaker 3>to support and support them in ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just maybe giving them some money </v>

2177
01:52:03.191 --> 01:52:05.710
<v Speaker 3>from time to time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but ask how you can help because,</v>

2178
01:52:05.810 --> 01:52:06.660
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2179
01:52:06.700 --> 01:52:08.950
<v Speaker 3>just to give you a couple of examples,</v>
<v Speaker 3>world wildlife fund,</v>

2180
01:52:09.250 --> 01:52:12.520
<v Speaker 3>a Canadian parks and wilderness society </v>
<v Speaker 3>both have excellent,</v>

2181
01:52:12.580 --> 01:52:16.010
<v Speaker 3>excellent people that need support,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2182
01:52:16.011 --> 01:52:16.844
<v Speaker 3>and not just money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they need people behind them in </v>

2183
01:52:19.751 --> 01:52:21.510
<v Speaker 3>various ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's various things.</v>

2184
01:52:21.860 --> 01:52:25.720
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I guess finally if you have children</v>

2185
01:52:25.840 --> 01:52:28.630
<v Speaker 3>will have children or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>work with kids.</v>

2186
01:52:29.170 --> 01:52:34.170
<v Speaker 3>Kids genuinely want to do things better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They understand kids,</v>

2187
01:52:34.990 --> 01:52:36.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're cute animal.</v>

2188
01:52:36.630 --> 01:52:39.870
<v Speaker 4>Well I was a bit insulted about that </v>
<v Speaker 4>fish that your child.</v>

2189
01:52:42.390 --> 01:52:46.180
<v Speaker 4>But I thought it was kind cute myself </v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

2190
01:52:46.210 --> 01:52:47.090
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2191
01:52:47.390 --> 01:52:48.223
<v Speaker 3>the important point is that kids love </v>
<v Speaker 3>whales are our little granddaughter </v>

2192
01:52:51.261 --> 01:52:54.440
<v Speaker 3>who's eight years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she proudly announces,</v>

2193
01:52:54.470 --> 01:52:57.670
<v Speaker 3>oh I'm doing a research project on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>Pacific Dolphin.</v>

2194
01:52:58.090 --> 01:52:59.870
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and by the time she finished that thing,</v>

2195
01:52:59.871 --> 01:53:03.170
<v Speaker 3>she knew a lot about Pacific dolphins </v>
<v Speaker 3>help people that way,</v>

2196
01:53:03.200 --> 01:53:05.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get at young people,</v>

2197
01:53:05.480 --> 01:53:06.313
<v Speaker 3>young people who really want to because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they are upset by these things and they </v>

2198
01:53:09.471 --> 01:53:11.930
<v Speaker 3>see it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of stuff on television and</v>

2199
01:53:11.931 --> 01:53:12.764
<v Speaker 3>so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Internet and they are getting done </v>

2200
01:53:14.811 --> 01:53:17.660
<v Speaker 3>that there's a problem and they happened</v>
<v Speaker 3>to love these things.</v>

2201
01:53:17.661 --> 01:53:18.494
<v Speaker 3>They love dolphins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they love seals and they decided the </v>

2202
01:53:20.811 --> 01:53:21.644
<v Speaker 3>other certainly whales and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can't understand why these things </v>

2203
01:53:25.161 --> 01:53:28.700
<v Speaker 3>are in trouble or the fish that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>might eat her in trouble.</v>

2204
01:53:29.030 --> 01:53:29.863
<v Speaker 3>So those are some concrete ways that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can actually address this and keep that </v>

2205
01:53:33.620 --> 01:53:36.320
<v Speaker 3>list in mind as you move ahead with Finn</v>
<v Speaker 3>as well.</v>

2206
01:53:36.400 --> 01:53:40.610
<v Speaker 3>Cause I think it's a really important </v>
<v Speaker 3>question when I'm talking and we all are</v>

2207
01:53:40.611 --> 01:53:42.410
<v Speaker 3>talking that may maybe a bit abstract </v>
<v Speaker 3>they hear,</v>

2208
01:53:42.411 --> 01:53:45.970
<v Speaker 3>but in each case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can bring these things down to,</v>

2209
01:53:45.980 --> 01:53:47.180
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to real life.</v>
