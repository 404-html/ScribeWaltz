1
00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:05.480
<v Speaker 1>Thank you all very much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you,</v>

2
00:00:05.481 --> 00:00:10.481
<v Speaker 1>Barbara for first and second for </v>
<v Speaker 1>attending.</v>

3
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.080
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to try to do something very</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult this evening.</v>

4
00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to try to put the idea of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights,</v>

5
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.650
<v Speaker 1>the right to free speech in the broadest</v>
<v Speaker 1>possible historical context.</v>

6
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.680
<v Speaker 1>I want to start with a comment though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know we have an idea of built into </v>

7
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.700
<v Speaker 1>our human rights legislation that all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rights are equal in some sense,</v>

8
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.740
<v Speaker 1>and that can't be true because rights </v>
<v Speaker 1>conflict with one another and when </v>

9
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.520
<v Speaker 1>things conflict they have to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchically organized and what that </v>

10
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.731
<v Speaker 1>means is that there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an implication that there is a </v>

11
00:00:51.731 --> 00:00:55.151
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy of rights as well as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy of responsibilities and that </v>

12
00:00:55.151 --> 00:00:58.601
<v Speaker 1>it's also incumbent on us to determine </v>
<v Speaker 1>the nature of that hierarchy and to </v>

13
00:00:58.601 --> 00:00:59.930
<v Speaker 1>determine what constitutes the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sovereign,</v>

14
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.470
<v Speaker 1>let's say the sovereign right and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>would say you might think of that as a </v>

15
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.371
<v Speaker 1>modern conundrum that would only be of </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest to countries that have </v>

16
00:01:10.551 --> 00:01:12.560
<v Speaker 1>formalized bills of rights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

17
00:01:12.561 --> 00:01:14.300
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a new problem.</v>

18
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.300
<v Speaker 1>It's an extraordinarily old problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there is no difference between </v>

19
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.180
<v Speaker 1>determining the hierarchy of your rights</v>
<v Speaker 1>and determining how to live together </v>

20
00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.050
<v Speaker 1>successfully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is exactly the same problem.</v>

21
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.190
<v Speaker 1>One is only articulated in the legal </v>
<v Speaker 1>forum and the problem of how we should </v>

22
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.240
<v Speaker 1>live together in the most productive </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible manner.</v>

23
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.710
<v Speaker 1>Everything considered is as old as </v>
<v Speaker 1>mankind itself.</v>

24
00:01:39.711 --> 00:01:44.711
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say far older than now because </v>

25
00:01:44.711 --> 00:01:47.200
<v Speaker 1>the same problem the devil's social </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals weigh down the phylogenetic </v>

26
00:01:47.451 --> 00:01:51.380
<v Speaker 1>chain and so this is an unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 1>archaic problem now.</v>

27
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.070
<v Speaker 1>Years ago when I started thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose in in earnest,</v>

28
00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:04.050
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to address what I later </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognized as a postmodern problem and </v>

29
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.810
<v Speaker 1>the problem was this was in the late </v>
<v Speaker 1>seventies and early eighties when the </v>

30
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.240
<v Speaker 1>Cold War was madly raging because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>peaked in 1962 and it peaked again in </v>

31
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.770
<v Speaker 1>about 1984 votes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course at that time people were </v>

32
00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.131
<v Speaker 1>very terrified about potential outcome </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Cold War and for very good </v>

33
00:02:24.131 --> 00:02:24.131
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>

34
00:02:24.131 --> 00:02:25.430
<v Speaker 1>And I was curious about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was curious about this,</v>

35
00:02:25.431 --> 00:02:28.670
<v Speaker 1>like insanely curious about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was obsessing me.</v>

36
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.890
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two things,</v>

37
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.010
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't understand why the world has </v>
<v Speaker 1>divided itself into two opposing </v>

38
00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.210
<v Speaker 1>narratives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why that had happened at all,</v>

39
00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.730
<v Speaker 1>and also why these narratives were of </v>
<v Speaker 1>such importance to people apparently </v>

40
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.561
<v Speaker 1>that we were willing to arm ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>far beyond the teeth and risk massive </v>

41
00:02:48.141 --> 00:02:52.320
<v Speaker 1>mutual annihilation to battle the battle</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

42
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.070
<v Speaker 1>The conflict between these two ways of </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at the world.</v>

43
00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:56.370
<v Speaker 1>And I was curious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

44
00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.780
<v Speaker 1>first the first question were these </v>
<v Speaker 1>merely two ways of looking at the world </v>

45
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.270
<v Speaker 1>now because you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

46
00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.380
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no shortage of ways to live in </v>

47
00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.380
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a moral,</v>

48
00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.650
<v Speaker 1>morally relativistic stance and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something to that obviously because </v>

49
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.650
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different people,</v>

50
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.290
<v Speaker 1>different occupations and a different </v>
<v Speaker 1>outlook and,</v>

51
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.620
<v Speaker 1>and so forth at different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different political beliefs.</v>

52
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.290
<v Speaker 1>So there's obviously many ways that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>can thrive in the world.</v>

53
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.470
<v Speaker 1>And so some degree of flexibility with </v>
<v Speaker 1>regards to what constitutes your </v>

54
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:26.750
<v Speaker 1>fundamental axioms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously is,</v>

55
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.900
<v Speaker 1>is necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

56
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.160
<v Speaker 1>but there's a deeper question and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a very deep question.</v>

57
00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.950
<v Speaker 1>I actually think it's the question at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bottom of the postmodern conundrum,</v>

58
00:03:35.951 --> 00:03:38.160
<v Speaker 1>which is whether or not there are any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

59
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.320
<v Speaker 1>reliable Meta narratives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say overarching narratives that </v>

60
00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.320
<v Speaker 1>can unite people in some fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

61
00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.490
<v Speaker 1>And so I was curious where were these </v>
<v Speaker 1>just to arbitrary ways of looking at the</v>

62
00:03:48.491 --> 00:03:53.491
<v Speaker 1>world both potentially equally valid and</v>
<v Speaker 1>where we are battling that out because </v>

63
00:03:53.591 --> 00:03:58.591
<v Speaker 1>we didn't know and there was no other </v>
<v Speaker 1>way to battle it out or was there </v>

64
00:03:58.591 --> 00:04:01.921
<v Speaker 1>something deeper at stake?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it possible that one or the other </v>

65
00:04:01.921 --> 00:04:05.491
<v Speaker 1>system was correct in some deep manner?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I believe I do truly believe that I </v>

66
00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.880
<v Speaker 1>entered that</v>

67
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.980
<v Speaker 1>that universe of questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say with as openness of mind is </v>

68
00:04:14.081 --> 00:04:16.390
<v Speaker 1>possible because I actually wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>find out the answer,</v>

69
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because.</v>

70
00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.030
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seemed to me the fundamental question</v>

71
00:04:19.031 --> 00:04:24.031
<v Speaker 1>that obviously we fought a whole cold </v>
<v Speaker 1>war about it was the fundamental </v>

72
00:04:24.031 --> 00:04:24.031
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who was this?</v>

73
00:04:24.031 --> 00:04:26.650
<v Speaker 1>It was the question everyone's minds </v>
<v Speaker 1>should have been concentrated on.</v>

74
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.600
<v Speaker 1>And so I started to study deeply this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this particular question.</v>

75
00:04:31.601 --> 00:04:32.650
<v Speaker 1>The first question was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

76
00:04:32.651 --> 00:04:35.050
<v Speaker 1>what were beliefs made out of like what </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly is it?</v>

77
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.160
<v Speaker 1>What are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are we talking about when we talk </v>

78
00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.160
<v Speaker 1>about a belief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does it mean that you have beliefs,</v>

79
00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.750
<v Speaker 1>our beliefs structured and also that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a psychological question rather than a </v>

80
00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.020
<v Speaker 1>political or economic question and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>took me a long time to figure out </v>

81
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.901
<v Speaker 1>because I didn't know if the fundamental</v>
<v Speaker 1>mental question was going to be </v>

82
00:04:51.901 --> 00:04:54.331
<v Speaker 1>sociological or political or economic or</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological energy turned out to be </v>

83
00:04:54.431 --> 00:04:56.790
<v Speaker 1>psychological or perhaps it turned out </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be spiritual.</v>

84
00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:01.820
<v Speaker 1>That's another way of thinking about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and if,</v>

85
00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.560
<v Speaker 1>if you could grasp beliefs,</v>

86
00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.970
<v Speaker 1>what would constitute a credible belief </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what would it mean for a belief to </v>

87
00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:21.321
<v Speaker 1>be credible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I can give you a little hint about </v>

88
00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:21.321
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned this from Shawn Psj,</v>

89
00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:23.220
<v Speaker 1>the developmental psychologists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant,</v>

90
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:27.180
<v Speaker 1>brilliant theorists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>genuine genius.</v>

91
00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:32.450
<v Speaker 1>He was interested in how children </v>
<v Speaker 1>organized games and he thought it's </v>

92
00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:36.021
<v Speaker 1>games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the organ or the Organization of Games </v>

93
00:05:36.021 --> 00:05:37.560
<v Speaker 1>by children as the precursor to adult </v>
<v Speaker 1>interaction.</v>

94
00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.590
<v Speaker 1>And he made some very interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>observations about games.</v>

95
00:05:40.591 --> 00:05:42.750
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially pretend games which are quite</v>

96
00:05:42.751 --> 00:05:45.690
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated because children will get </v>
<v Speaker 1>together and play pretend games and what</v>

97
00:05:45.691 --> 00:05:48.720
<v Speaker 1>they'll do is they act out a simulation </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the world.</v>

98
00:05:48.721 --> 00:05:51.330
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they play house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all get together and they cast each</v>

99
00:05:51.331 --> 00:05:56.331
<v Speaker 1>other in different roles and then they </v>
<v Speaker 1>each act out those roles and they do </v>

100
00:05:56.331 --> 00:06:00.231
<v Speaker 1>that and now in order to simulate </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that they're going to have to </v>

101
00:06:00.231 --> 00:06:00.231
<v Speaker 1>adapt to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he has.</v>

102
00:06:00.231 --> 00:06:04.930
<v Speaker 1>Jay noted a couple of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first thing you noted was that </v>

103
00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:06.170
<v Speaker 1>children playing games can play the </v>
<v Speaker 1>games in a group.</v>

104
00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.110
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can play a game in a group.</v>

105
00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:15.300
<v Speaker 1>But if you take them out of the group </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you ask them what the rules of the </v>

106
00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:15.300
<v Speaker 1>game are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't know.</v>

107
00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.110
<v Speaker 1>They can't articulate the rules of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>game yet.</v>

108
00:06:18.111 --> 00:06:20.420
<v Speaker 1>When you put them together in the group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can play the game.</v>

109
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.850
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh that's just like adults.</v>

110
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.100
<v Speaker 1>You see because.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because.</v>

111
00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:30.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we wouldn't need a psychology </v>

112
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:30.380
<v Speaker 1>otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

113
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:30.380
<v Speaker 1>Because we'd all be transparent to </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves already.</v>

114
00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:35.410
<v Speaker 1>So what that means is when we all get </v>
<v Speaker 1>together and play a game like the one </v>

115
00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:35.420
<v Speaker 1>that we're playing in this room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

116
00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.940
<v Speaker 1>we all can play the game when we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>

117
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.010
<v Speaker 1>but if we brought us out and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

118
00:06:40.011 --> 00:06:42.140
<v Speaker 1>what are the rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we wouldn't able to articulate them.</v>

119
00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:47.560
<v Speaker 1>And then I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that means that those rules evolve </v>

120
00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.050
<v Speaker 1>in a real sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they evolved in a behavioral </v>

121
00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:50.050
<v Speaker 1>competition and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's.</v>

122
00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:51.440
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot like what's happening with </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>

123
00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:56.480
<v Speaker 1>If you look at how a chimpanzee troop is</v>
<v Speaker 1>organized or a wolf pack and social </v>

124
00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.610
<v Speaker 1>animals for that matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going way down the phylogenetic chain,</v>

125
00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:03.140
<v Speaker 1>they have to interact with one another </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a manner that that sustains the group</v>

126
00:07:03.141 --> 00:07:08.141
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise they all die obviously</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it sustains the individuals within </v>

127
00:07:08.141 --> 00:07:10.250
<v Speaker 1>the group and offers the individual some</v>
<v Speaker 1>some scope of action.</v>

128
00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:15.580
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a set of implicit </v>
<v Speaker 1>constraints on the manner in which </v>

129
00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:19.150
<v Speaker 1>creatures interact or they don't live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And and Piaget also came to the same </v>

130
00:07:20.211 --> 00:07:22.010
<v Speaker 1>conclusion with regards to children's </v>
<v Speaker 1>games.</v>

131
00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:27.310
<v Speaker 1>And this is where he made a distinction </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so crucial because piaget was </v>

132
00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:31.361
<v Speaker 1>actually interested in bridging the gap </v>
<v Speaker 1>between science and religion and I was </v>

133
00:07:31.361 --> 00:07:32.160
<v Speaker 1>his fundamental,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fundamental motivation,</v>

134
00:07:32.161 --> 00:07:37.161
<v Speaker 1>although very few people know that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he was interested in bridging the gap </v>

135
00:07:37.161 --> 00:07:40.541
<v Speaker 1>between science and ethics and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was interested in how ethics </v>

136
00:07:40.541 --> 00:07:43.480
<v Speaker 1>evolved as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a concept and then as practically </v>

137
00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:44.840
<v Speaker 1>applicable as something that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>practically applicable.</v>

138
00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:48.410
<v Speaker 1>And he made some very interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>comments about games and said,</v>

139
00:07:48.411 --> 00:07:51.260
<v Speaker 1>well look what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what constitutes a good game?</v>

140
00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:52.910
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

141
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:58.270
<v Speaker 1>one rule is everybody plays voluntarily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a really good game.</v>

142
00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.610
<v Speaker 1>And then he made another claim which was</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite cool,</v>

143
00:08:01.611 --> 00:08:04.760
<v Speaker 1>which was imagine that you had a game a </v>
<v Speaker 1>and B and b,</v>

144
00:08:04.761 --> 00:08:07.740
<v Speaker 1>and they were competing against the </v>
<v Speaker 1>target and in,</v>

145
00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:12.790
<v Speaker 1>in game beat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were being forced to play in a </v>

146
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:14.950
<v Speaker 1>game a people were playing voluntarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you track their track record </v>

147
00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:16.100
<v Speaker 1>with regards to competitors advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Over time,</v>

148
00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:19.880
<v Speaker 1>the game that people were playing </v>
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily would win because the people</v>

149
00:08:19.881 --> 00:08:22.760
<v Speaker 1>who were playing wouldn't have to waste </v>
<v Speaker 1>any effort in enforcement costs.</v>

150
00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:23.900
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

151
00:08:23.901 --> 00:08:28.901
<v Speaker 1>that's so smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so smart because because you can </v>

152
00:08:28.901 --> 00:08:32.141
<v Speaker 1>see the idea of the emergence of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>ethic theory and not an ethic that's </v>

153
00:08:32.141 --> 00:08:32.360
<v Speaker 1>rationally constructed.</v>

154
00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.320
<v Speaker 1>It's an ethic that's actually emerging </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the board.</v>

155
00:08:34.321 --> 00:08:36.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm up now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche,</v>

156
00:08:36.661 --> 00:08:41.661
<v Speaker 1>he also pointed out that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are epic actually emerged from the </v>

157
00:08:41.661 --> 00:08:41.661
<v Speaker 1>bottom up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't rational.</v>

158
00:08:41.661 --> 00:08:44.300
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't top down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't enlightenment oriented.</v>

159
00:08:44.301 --> 00:08:49.301
<v Speaker 1>Even though the enlightenment might've </v>
<v Speaker 1>codifying it as part of a process of </v>

160
00:08:49.301 --> 00:08:53.420
<v Speaker 1>notification that took place over a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>long period of time and so and then I </v>

161
00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:55.740
<v Speaker 1>read other things to say about the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>that animals organized the troops.</v>

162
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:59.420
<v Speaker 1>This was later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's relevant to our talk today that</v>

163
00:08:59.421 --> 00:09:04.421
<v Speaker 1>primatologist Frans de Waal for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is trying to find out what makes </v>

164
00:09:04.421 --> 00:09:05.250
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzee troops stable across time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

165
00:09:05.251 --> 00:09:08.730
<v Speaker 1>you kind of have this idea that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzee troop is driven,</v>

166
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:10.770
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the most dominant,</v>

167
00:09:10.771 --> 00:09:12.660
<v Speaker 1>powerful male,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most aggressive,</v>

168
00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:16.260
<v Speaker 1>cruel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tyrannical chimpanzee dominates.</v>

169
00:09:16.261 --> 00:09:18.300
<v Speaker 1>And that isn't what friends do all </v>
<v Speaker 1>found.</v>

170
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:23.630
<v Speaker 1>What he found was that in order that </v>
<v Speaker 1>those sorts of chimpanzee troops have </v>

171
00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:27.801
<v Speaker 1>leaders that meet very violent and </v>
<v Speaker 1>because no matter how Thai radical you </v>

172
00:09:27.801 --> 00:09:30.870
<v Speaker 1>are as top Cim to chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three quarters of your size can take you</v>

173
00:09:30.871 --> 00:09:34.200
<v Speaker 1>out and they will and chimpanzees are </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably,</v>

174
00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:38.820
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably brutal and very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very strong and so tyrannical chimpanzee</v>

175
00:09:38.821 --> 00:09:40.110
<v Speaker 1>troops are unstable.</v>

176
00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:44.310
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's how major league </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovery now because it starts to.</v>

177
00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:49.520
<v Speaker 1>It starts to open up the possibility </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the ethic upon which functional </v>

178
00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:52.800
<v Speaker 1>states are predicated is far deeper than</v>
<v Speaker 1>any near story or any near rationality,</v>

179
00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:57.890
<v Speaker 1>and that's a really exciting possibility</v>
<v Speaker 1>because what it means is that there </v>

180
00:09:57.890 --> 00:09:59.640
<v Speaker 1>might be something at the bottom of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>ethic that's really there.</v>

181
00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.280
<v Speaker 1>It's not just some arbitrary constructed</v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative.</v>

182
00:10:02.281 --> 00:10:07.281
<v Speaker 1>It's not just one set of ways to live in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world among many and I would say I </v>

183
00:10:07.281 --> 00:10:08.590
<v Speaker 1>would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I tried to outline this partly in 12</v>

184
00:10:08.591 --> 00:10:13.591
<v Speaker 1>rules for life and more in detail in </v>
<v Speaker 1>maps of meaning that the evidence on </v>

185
00:10:13.591 --> 00:10:17.151
<v Speaker 1>that is already in is that there is a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a convergence ethic that </v>

186
00:10:17.791 --> 00:10:22.791
<v Speaker 1>emerges from the bottom up over </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary spans of time over millions</v>

187
00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:27.830
<v Speaker 1>of years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over hundreds of thousands of years or </v>

188
00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:29.421
<v Speaker 1>tens of thousands of years as people </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn how to act in a manner that </v>

189
00:10:29.421 --> 00:10:33.870
<v Speaker 1>sustains them as individuals now and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>week from now,</v>

190
00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:35.340
<v Speaker 1>a month from now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year from now,</v>

191
00:10:35.341 --> 00:10:39.540
<v Speaker 1>so it has to be iterative that sustains </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and their families simultaneously.</v>

192
00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:44.690
<v Speaker 1>It sustains them and their families and </v>
<v Speaker 1>their communities across all those </v>

193
00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:46.140
<v Speaker 1>timeframes simultaneously and that's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

194
00:10:46.141 --> 00:10:51.141
<v Speaker 1>very tight set of constraints and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>there might be a very large number of </v>

195
00:10:51.141 --> 00:10:54.801
<v Speaker 1>ways to interpret the world as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>postmoderns postmodernists accurately </v>

196
00:10:54.801 --> 00:10:56.640
<v Speaker 1>have it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are not a very large number of</v>

197
00:10:56.641 --> 00:10:59.340
<v Speaker 1>ways to exist successfully in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

198
00:10:59.341 --> 00:11:04.341
<v Speaker 1>it's extraordinary to constraint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's constrained by the necessity of </v>

199
00:11:04.341 --> 00:11:08.061
<v Speaker 1>playing an iterative voluntary game and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a tight constraint as any of you </v>

200
00:11:08.071 --> 00:11:09.090
<v Speaker 1>who are married.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

201
00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:10.500
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

202
00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:15.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's absolutely definitively </v>

203
00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.730
<v Speaker 1>because you see the marriages are very </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting balancing act because it has</v>

204
00:11:17.731 --> 00:11:19.950
<v Speaker 1>to be good for you and it has to be good</v>
<v Speaker 1>for your wife,</v>

205
00:11:19.951 --> 00:11:24.951
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also has to be good for the two </v>

206
00:11:24.951 --> 00:11:27.171
<v Speaker 1>of you and it has to depend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's super ordinary to each of </v>

207
00:11:27.171 --> 00:11:30.321
<v Speaker 1>you as individuals and it has to be good</v>
<v Speaker 1>for you in a way that's good for your </v>

208
00:11:30.321 --> 00:11:33.651
<v Speaker 1>children and that has to work in society</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it has to be something that you can </v>

209
00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:34.500
<v Speaker 1>play out moment by moment and hour to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hour,</v>

210
00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:36.600
<v Speaker 1>day to day and month to month and week </v>
<v Speaker 1>to week.</v>

211
00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:40.140
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know perfectly well that there isn't</v>

212
00:11:40.141 --> 00:11:43.320
<v Speaker 1>much deviation from the straight and </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrow path if you're going to play that</v>

213
00:11:43.321 --> 00:11:48.321
<v Speaker 1>game because there's just too many ways </v>
<v Speaker 1>of falling into trouble and there's way </v>

214
00:11:48.321 --> 00:11:49.410
<v Speaker 1>more ways of falling into trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The North falling into trouble.</v>

215
00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:50.320
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

216
00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:52.500
<v Speaker 1>so that's the first thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine this.</v>

217
00:11:52.501 --> 00:11:53.950
<v Speaker 1>So this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the idea.</v>

218
00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:54.390
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

219
00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:58.950
<v Speaker 1>the ethic emerges from the bottom up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As we learn how to organize ourselves in</v>

220
00:11:58.951 --> 00:12:02.010
<v Speaker 1>evermore complex society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sustainable societies,</v>

221
00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:04.440
<v Speaker 1>and we don't know what we're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

222
00:12:04.441 --> 00:12:09.441
<v Speaker 1>but then what happens is because we are </v>
<v Speaker 1>insanely curious and capable of self </v>

223
00:12:09.441 --> 00:12:10.890
<v Speaker 1>recognition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we start to tell stories about how it is</v>

224
00:12:10.891 --> 00:12:13.740
<v Speaker 1>that we're acting and the stories have </v>
<v Speaker 1>two forms.</v>

225
00:12:13.741 --> 00:12:18.660
<v Speaker 1>One story is about the structures that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we exist in and that's the stories about</v>

226
00:12:18.661 --> 00:12:20.610
<v Speaker 1>other people and every stories about </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people,</v>

227
00:12:20.611 --> 00:12:25.611
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because we live in a social world and </v>

228
00:12:25.611 --> 00:12:25.611
<v Speaker 1>you never see a story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never go to a movie,</v>

229
00:12:25.611 --> 00:12:29.451
<v Speaker 1>you never read a novel that he isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>about society and no wonder because </v>

230
00:12:29.451 --> 00:12:31.800
<v Speaker 1>that's our environment society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So stories are about society and they're</v>

231
00:12:31.801 --> 00:12:36.801
<v Speaker 1>about how societies succeed and fail and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there about how individuals within that </v>

232
00:12:36.801 --> 00:12:41.181
<v Speaker 1>society succeed or fail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because what we're trying to do is to </v>

233
00:12:41.181 --> 00:12:41.181
<v Speaker 1>watch her.</v>

234
00:12:41.181 --> 00:12:43.010
<v Speaker 1>So I mean again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the massive historical timeframes.</v>

235
00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:48.210
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to watch how it is that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>act when we act properly and figure out </v>

236
00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:51.771
<v Speaker 1>how to do it as individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the first way we do that is to coat </v>

237
00:12:51.771 --> 00:12:52.250
<v Speaker 1>it in stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what stories are for.</v>

238
00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:57.440
<v Speaker 1>That's what great literature is for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why there are great villains and </v>

239
00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:00.921
<v Speaker 1>great heroes and great literature </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you want to know how to be a </v>

240
00:13:00.921 --> 00:13:04.011
<v Speaker 1>great hero unless you want to be a great</v>
<v Speaker 1>villain and if you want to be a great </v>

241
00:13:04.011 --> 00:13:07.581
<v Speaker 1>hero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can learn from great villains the </v>

242
00:13:07.581 --> 00:13:07.830
<v Speaker 1>opposite of how to act and so you get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get incredible,</v>

243
00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:13.160
<v Speaker 1>incredibly sophisticated representations</v>
<v Speaker 1>emerging out of that process so that </v>

244
00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:14.670
<v Speaker 1>they take on an archetype of form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so for example,</v>

245
00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:19.910
<v Speaker 1>the the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the motif of the hostile brothers which </v>

246
00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:22.320
<v Speaker 1>has developed into and Christianity into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the twin adversaries of Christ and Satan</v>

247
00:13:22.321 --> 00:13:27.321
<v Speaker 1>or Cain and Abel are the idea of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hero who thrives in the social world and</v>

248
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:29.850
<v Speaker 1>brings renewal to the cosmos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

249
00:13:29.851 --> 00:13:34.851
<v Speaker 1>against the deadly adversaries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly what you need to </v>

250
00:13:34.851 --> 00:13:34.851
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

251
00:13:34.851 --> 00:13:39.351
<v Speaker 1>it's not arbitrary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not an arbitrary set of </v>

252
00:13:39.351 --> 00:13:41.931
<v Speaker 1>propositions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's predicated on the observation of </v>

253
00:13:41.931 --> 00:13:42.480
<v Speaker 1>successful and unsuccessful patterns of </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior over very,</v>

254
00:13:42.481 --> 00:13:43.250
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

255
00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:48.320
<v Speaker 1>very long stretches of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a behavioral platform and </v>

256
00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:51.660
<v Speaker 1>then there's a narrative representation </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that platform.</v>

257
00:13:51.661 --> 00:13:56.661
<v Speaker 1>Then the two things start to interact </v>
<v Speaker 1>because once you have drama and </v>

258
00:13:56.661 --> 00:13:59.751
<v Speaker 1>literature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can learn from drama and literature </v>

259
00:13:59.751 --> 00:14:02.151
<v Speaker 1>and ultra how you behave and your ethic </v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes portable and then what happens </v>

260
00:14:02.151 --> 00:14:02.730
<v Speaker 1>after that is that</v>

261
00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:11.130
<v Speaker 1>what happens after that is that thinkers</v>
<v Speaker 1>who now have both the behavioral strata </v>

262
00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:14.050
<v Speaker 1>and the representational strata in front</v>
<v Speaker 1>of them,</v>

263
00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:20.280
<v Speaker 1>the procedural ethic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that behavioral ethic plus the story </v>

264
00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:20.470
<v Speaker 1>representation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Step one,</v>

265
00:14:20.471 --> 00:14:22.930
<v Speaker 1>step back from that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially after it's written down.</v>

266
00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:28.090
<v Speaker 1>This is why the Bible are of such </v>
<v Speaker 1>critical importance because the pattern,</v>

267
00:14:28.091 --> 00:14:33.091
<v Speaker 1>the dramatic patterns are then written </v>
<v Speaker 1>down and then you can step back from </v>

268
00:14:33.091 --> 00:14:34.390
<v Speaker 1>them with your consciousness and you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>start to analyze them for their,</v>

269
00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:39.690
<v Speaker 1>for the rule based content.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see that emerging to some degree in </v>

270
00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:43.351
<v Speaker 1>the story of Moses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's actually what's laid out in part </v>

271
00:14:43.351 --> 00:14:45.751
<v Speaker 1>in the story of Moses because Moses is </v>
<v Speaker 1>leading his people through the desert </v>

272
00:14:45.751 --> 00:14:49.140
<v Speaker 1>and watching how they fight and watching</v>
<v Speaker 1>how they behave and then he has this </v>

273
00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:49.140
<v Speaker 1>tree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's all very,</v>

274
00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:53.701
<v Speaker 1>very dramatic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he has this tremendous revelation </v>

275
00:14:53.701 --> 00:14:54.730
<v Speaker 1>which is this is how we already act.</v>

276
00:14:55.310 --> 00:15:00.310
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens is the rules are </v>

277
00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:02.240
<v Speaker 1>codified on the basis of the observation</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the patterns that are already extent </v>

278
00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.370
<v Speaker 1>that are functional as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation of consciousness.</v>

279
00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:09.610
<v Speaker 1>At that point you have your ethic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is far deeper than anything that </v>

280
00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:13.181
<v Speaker 1>you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>start to be articulated out into the </v>

281
00:15:13.181 --> 00:15:13.610
<v Speaker 1>body of laws,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the point at which you have,</v>

282
00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:15.860
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>true philosophy and the beginning of the</v>

283
00:15:15.861 --> 00:15:20.861
<v Speaker 1>body of laws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called the body of laws for a </v>

284
00:15:20.861 --> 00:15:20.861
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

285
00:15:20.861 --> 00:15:25.270
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was all just amazing to </v>

286
00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:26.180
<v Speaker 1>have who have to have observed them to </v>
<v Speaker 1>think about that bottom up process.</v>

287
00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:31.490
<v Speaker 1>Then I started reading a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious mythology and I ran across </v>

288
00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:35.651
<v Speaker 1>this motif that was developed very in </v>
<v Speaker 1>great detail by a Romanian Murcia,</v>

289
00:15:36.741 --> 00:15:38.450
<v Speaker 1>Eliana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is a great scholar of religion.</v>

290
00:15:38.451 --> 00:15:43.451
<v Speaker 1>So group wrote remarkable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remarkable books including a history of </v>

291
00:15:43.451 --> 00:15:44.660
<v Speaker 1>religious ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is highly recommended book.</v>

292
00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:49.660
<v Speaker 1>And he talked about this interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>motif that I had run across and other </v>

293
00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:51.710
<v Speaker 1>writings on mythology and and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in religious stories,</v>

294
00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:54.500
<v Speaker 1>which was the battle of the Gods in </v>
<v Speaker 1>heaven across time.</v>

295
00:15:54.501 --> 00:15:56.900
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things they pointed out </v>
<v Speaker 1>was that if you,</v>

296
00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:59.300
<v Speaker 1>if you looked at the development of </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious system,</v>

297
00:15:59.301 --> 00:16:04.301
<v Speaker 1>so say the development of the religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>system that came to dominate in </v>

298
00:16:04.301 --> 00:16:05.240
<v Speaker 1>Mesopotamia when the Mesopotamian tribes</v>
<v Speaker 1>came together.</v>

299
00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:07.390
<v Speaker 1>So imagine each of those tribes have </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own gone,</v>

300
00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:09.170
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when they came together,</v>

301
00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:14.410
<v Speaker 1>that was terribly fractious because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know what happens when different people </v>

302
00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:17.291
<v Speaker 1>with different gods get together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's suddenly it's ugly and it's no </v>

303
00:16:17.291 --> 00:16:18.590
<v Speaker 1>wonder because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they each have an ethic and they,</v>

304
00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:23.630
<v Speaker 1>they're living within the ethic and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're using it to structure their </v>

305
00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:23.630
<v Speaker 1>worlds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the ethics apparently Clyde.</v>

306
00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:28.480
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens at the civilization </v>
<v Speaker 1>level is that there's constant </v>

307
00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:31.640
<v Speaker 1>negotiation and cognitive transformation</v>
<v Speaker 1>within the individual populations,</v>

308
00:16:31.641 --> 00:16:36.641
<v Speaker 1>but that's represented over the large </v>
<v Speaker 1>span of time as a battle between the </v>

309
00:16:36.641 --> 00:16:38.210
<v Speaker 1>gods that represent the different tribes</v>
<v Speaker 1>in heaven.</v>

310
00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:42.290
<v Speaker 1>And so then what happens across time as </v>
<v Speaker 1>all those gods organized themselves into</v>

311
00:16:42.291 --> 00:16:46.400
<v Speaker 1>a hierarchy and one God comes out on top</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that God is the Supreme God.</v>

312
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:48.560
<v Speaker 1>And then the society is like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mesopotamia,</v>

313
00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:51.050
<v Speaker 1>Mesopotamia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That also happened in ancient Greece.</v>

314
00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:56.500
<v Speaker 1>They assume that they're sovereign is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the person who acts out in a sovereign </v>

315
00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:57.620
<v Speaker 1>God because you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

316
00:16:57.621 --> 00:17:00.260
<v Speaker 1>where does the concept of sovereignty </v>
<v Speaker 1>come from?</v>

317
00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:05.590
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's not just brute force and it's </v>

318
00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:06.020
<v Speaker 1>not because brute force doesn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has to have some other basis.</v>

319
00:17:06.021 --> 00:17:09.950
<v Speaker 1>What's the basis of sovereignty?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the basis of authority?</v>

320
00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:11.930
<v Speaker 1>Not Power Authority,</v>
<v Speaker 1>competence,</v>

321
00:17:11.931 --> 00:17:13.250
<v Speaker 1>authority,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

322
00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:18.400
<v Speaker 1>Well how has that played out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's played out by the battle between </v>

323
00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.360
<v Speaker 1>ethics systems of ethics that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>represented in religious language across</v>

324
00:17:20.361 --> 00:17:25.361
<v Speaker 1>vast epochs of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the societies of God's would </v>

325
00:17:25.361 --> 00:17:29.240
<v Speaker 1>say organize themselves into a hierarchy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they have a god at the top and </v>

326
00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:31.520
<v Speaker 1>that's actually laid right out in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Enuma elish for example,</v>

327
00:17:31.521 --> 00:17:36.521
<v Speaker 1>which is the oldest creation story that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we have and out of which it's derived </v>

328
00:17:37.251 --> 00:17:37.880
<v Speaker 1>from the same.</v>

329
00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:43.570
<v Speaker 1>What would you say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cultural substrate as the stories in </v>

330
00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:43.570
<v Speaker 1>genesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

331
00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:47.110
<v Speaker 1>although it represents a variant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Mesopotamians had older gods </v>

332
00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:51.090
<v Speaker 1>aggregate themselves together because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were threatened by the unknown.</v>

333
00:17:51.091 --> 00:17:53.970
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens in the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the Mesopotamian creation myth,</v>

334
00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:57.960
<v Speaker 1>the unknown gives rise to the gods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They become very fractious and compete,</v>

335
00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:00.390
<v Speaker 1>and then the unknown decides to destroy </v>
<v Speaker 1>them again,</v>

336
00:18:00.391 --> 00:18:03.090
<v Speaker 1>like God destroying Noah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was people in the flood.</v>

337
00:18:03.091 --> 00:18:05.370
<v Speaker 1>It's the same basic idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an idea there.</v>

338
00:18:05.371 --> 00:18:10.371
<v Speaker 1>The idea is that we emerge out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unknown and we're always threatened by </v>

339
00:18:10.441 --> 00:18:12.810
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only as individuals but as a group,</v>

340
00:18:12.811 --> 00:18:17.811
<v Speaker 1>and that means that we need to figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>out what it is that should guide us in </v>

341
00:18:17.811 --> 00:18:19.110
<v Speaker 1>order to continually confront the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unknown and prevail.</v>

342
00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:24.290
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens in Mesopotamia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gods all get together in a congress </v>

343
00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:26.730
<v Speaker 1>and they basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they elect a new God and he's a new kind</v>

344
00:18:26.731 --> 00:18:27.180
<v Speaker 1>of God.</v>

345
00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:28.830
<v Speaker 1>His name is Martin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

346
00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:32.520
<v Speaker 1>He has eyes all the way around his head </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so he pays attention.</v>

347
00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:35.550
<v Speaker 1>That's not the same as thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a different thing.</v>

348
00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:37.080
<v Speaker 1>Attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the same thing.</v>

349
00:18:37.081 --> 00:18:40.140
<v Speaker 1>The Egyptians representative in worship </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the eye of horus.</v>

350
00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:44.040
<v Speaker 1>The idea that what you should do if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to survive in this world and if you</v>

351
00:18:44.041 --> 00:18:49.041
<v Speaker 1>want to play a voluntary game that </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody could participate in your </v>

352
00:18:49.041 --> 00:18:50.100
<v Speaker 1>bloody eyes better be open because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>are the things that will save you,</v>

353
00:18:50.101 --> 00:18:52.560
<v Speaker 1>and that's the tension and the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that mark did,</v>

354
00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:55.500
<v Speaker 1>he spoke magic words and so when he </v>
<v Speaker 1>spoke,</v>

355
00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:58.110
<v Speaker 1>the night sky would appear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Day sky would appearance,</v>

356
00:18:58.111 --> 00:19:03.111
<v Speaker 1>so the Mesopotamians figured out in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their great religious story that the </v>

357
00:19:03.111 --> 00:19:05.850
<v Speaker 1>fundamental sovereign God was he who </v>
<v Speaker 1>pays attention and speaks the truth,</v>

358
00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:10.050
<v Speaker 1>and that's something that's something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

359
00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:12.660
<v Speaker 1>that's not something you punish people </v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

360
00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:13.920
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

361
00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:16.860
<v Speaker 1>Because there's this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the deepest idea of mankind.</v>

362
00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:20.640
<v Speaker 1>It's developed in detail in Genesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Old Testament.</v>

363
00:19:20.641 --> 00:19:24.450
<v Speaker 1>It's the fundamental idea of genesis </v>
<v Speaker 1>that God uses the logos,</v>

364
00:19:24.451 --> 00:19:28.710
<v Speaker 1>the word of God to cast hotel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we all face.</v>

365
00:19:28.711 --> 00:19:30.240
<v Speaker 1>That's what we face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Potential.</v>

366
00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:33.750
<v Speaker 1>You know that you know that the future </v>
<v Speaker 1>is unstructured.</v>

367
00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.690
<v Speaker 1>You have a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a potential within you that can</v>

368
00:19:36.691 --> 00:19:39.690
<v Speaker 1>meet that and there's a potential that </v>
<v Speaker 1>characterizes the future.</v>

369
00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:42.300
<v Speaker 1>You meet it with eyes open,</v>
<v Speaker 1>end with truthful speech,</v>

370
00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:47.480
<v Speaker 1>and that's what happens in genesis </v>
<v Speaker 1>because God uses the logos which is </v>

371
00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:50.580
<v Speaker 1>truthful speech to cast the pre </v>
<v Speaker 1>cosmogony potential into habitable order</v>

372
00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:53.910
<v Speaker 1>and then he says it's good and there </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a hint there,</v>

373
00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:55.350
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you think,</v>

374
00:19:55.351 --> 00:19:57.240
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is habitable order good?</v>

375
00:19:57.241 --> 00:20:00.600
<v Speaker 1>Because life is very difficult and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>a real question whether or not the order</v>

376
00:20:00.601 --> 00:20:05.601
<v Speaker 1>that we inhabit is good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the hypothesis in the Old Testament </v>

377
00:20:05.601 --> 00:20:07.200
<v Speaker 1>is that if truthful speech gives rise to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the order,</v>

378
00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:12.290
<v Speaker 1>then that order will be good and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>really something man like that's really </v>

379
00:20:12.661 --> 00:20:13.830
<v Speaker 1>something to apprehend.</v>

380
00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:19.040
<v Speaker 1>It's fundamental theological </v>
<v Speaker 1>presupposition that the way that you </v>

381
00:20:19.111 --> 00:20:24.111
<v Speaker 1>take the potential upon which the cosmos</v>
<v Speaker 1>is predicated and cast to the into the </v>

382
00:20:24.111 --> 00:20:28.050
<v Speaker 1>order that allows everyone to thrive is </v>
<v Speaker 1>by using truthful speech.</v>

383
00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:33.770
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't be something if that was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>case and the thing is you know it's the </v>

384
00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:36.981
<v Speaker 1>case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you know it because you do not </v>

385
00:20:36.981 --> 00:20:37.350
<v Speaker 1>admire yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're deceitful,</v>

386
00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:40.200
<v Speaker 1>you admire yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you have those rare moments in your</v>

387
00:20:40.201 --> 00:20:44.670
<v Speaker 1>life where you can actually stand up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>say what's true regardless of the cost,</v>

388
00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:49.880
<v Speaker 1>and if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you give that respect to other </v>

389
00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:53.191
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you treat them as if they're the </v>

390
00:20:53.191 --> 00:20:54.991
<v Speaker 1>locale of the divine speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the casts potential into habitable </v>

391
00:20:54.991 --> 00:20:55.600
<v Speaker 1>order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they like you,</v>

392
00:20:55.810 --> 00:21:00.810
<v Speaker 1>maybe they even love you and they get </v>
<v Speaker 1>along with you when you could work with </v>

393
00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:01.060
<v Speaker 1>them and you can cooperate with them and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can compete with them.</v>

394
00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:06.300
<v Speaker 1>So not only is it the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental axiom that regulates </v>

395
00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:10.231
<v Speaker 1>your relationship with yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the fundamental axiom that </v>

396
00:21:10.231 --> 00:21:13.321
<v Speaker 1>regulates your interactions with other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and if you do not give them that </v>

397
00:21:13.321 --> 00:21:17.670
<v Speaker 1>that honor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the presupposition for their </v>

398
00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:17.740
<v Speaker 1>natural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

399
00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:22.770
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the idea that you haven't </v>

400
00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:22.770
<v Speaker 1>natural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

401
00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:22.770
<v Speaker 1>is the idea that you have some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>intrinsic value.</v>

402
00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:26.170
<v Speaker 1>If you don't treat people as if they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have that intrinsic right,</v>

403
00:21:26.171 --> 00:21:29.260
<v Speaker 1>they are not happy with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if they don't know why,</v>

404
00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:34.650
<v Speaker 1>because everyone wants to be treated as </v>
<v Speaker 1>if they have freewill and is if they </v>

405
00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:37.870
<v Speaker 1>confront potential and as if they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>capable of making moral choices and that</v>

406
00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:42.930
<v Speaker 1>they should be rewarded when they do </v>
<v Speaker 1>things right and perhaps punished when </v>

407
00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:46.111
<v Speaker 1>they do things wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone wants that and everyone knows </v>

408
00:21:46.111 --> 00:21:49.021
<v Speaker 1>it and so well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what does that all have to do with </v>

409
00:21:49.021 --> 00:21:49.021
<v Speaker 1>free speech?</v>

410
00:21:49.021 --> 00:21:50.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

411
00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:52.030
<v Speaker 1>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly right.</v>

412
00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:56.770
<v Speaker 1>So free speech isn't free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

413
00:21:56.771 --> 00:22:00.150
<v Speaker 1>people think of free speech is Kinda </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a decoration,</v>

414
00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:03.100
<v Speaker 1>something like that in your life and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that at all.</v>

415
00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:06.790
<v Speaker 1>It's not the ability to speak truth to </v>
<v Speaker 1>power,</v>

416
00:22:06.791 --> 00:22:09.250
<v Speaker 1>although it is also that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that.</v>

417
00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:13.420
<v Speaker 1>It's way more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Free speech is how you think.</v>

418
00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:19.130
<v Speaker 1>It's not thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know the word genesis relies on to </v>

419
00:22:19.391 --> 00:22:21.250
<v Speaker 1>create cosmos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say in the story.</v>

420
00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:26.430
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the image of God in which you're </v>

421
00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:26.830
<v Speaker 1>made male and female.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That gives you that fundamental value.</v>

422
00:22:26.831 --> 00:22:28.990
<v Speaker 1>That's at the core of our idea of </v>
<v Speaker 1>natural,</v>

423
00:22:28.991 --> 00:22:33.991
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not thinking it's speaking and the </v>

424
00:22:33.991 --> 00:22:34.630
<v Speaker 1>reason for that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

425
00:22:34.631 --> 00:22:37.240
<v Speaker 1>you can hardly think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard to think.</v>

426
00:22:37.241 --> 00:22:39.040
<v Speaker 1>You have to be trained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like mad to think.</v>

427
00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:44.250
<v Speaker 1>You have to be able to divide yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>internally into a couple of different </v>

428
00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:47.551
<v Speaker 1>people and then you have to let those </v>
<v Speaker 1>people have a war in your head and that </v>

429
00:22:47.551 --> 00:22:50.620
<v Speaker 1>means you have to develop characters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have opinions in great detail,</v>

430
00:22:50.621 --> 00:22:55.621
<v Speaker 1>opinions that might be contrary to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>own and then you have to withstand the </v>

431
00:22:55.621 --> 00:22:58.981
<v Speaker 1>tension of letting them have it out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you only see that thinking in great </v>

432
00:22:58.981 --> 00:22:58.981
<v Speaker 1>literature.</v>

433
00:22:58.981 --> 00:23:03.780
<v Speaker 1>Like you see that in Dostoevsky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's an absolute master of that and you </v>

434
00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:03.970
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can think a little bit,</v>

435
00:23:03.971 --> 00:23:07.840
<v Speaker 1>but mostly you're biased and you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>confirmation bias and you see things the</v>

436
00:23:07.841 --> 00:23:12.841
<v Speaker 1>way you see them and you have massive </v>
<v Speaker 1>blind spots in your ignorance as hell </v>

437
00:23:12.841 --> 00:23:12.841
<v Speaker 1>and you just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just,</v>

438
00:23:12.841 --> 00:23:14.110
<v Speaker 1>you just can't think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can talk.</v>

439
00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:17.410
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is if you talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people will correct you.</v>

440
00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:20.140
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's thinking.</v>

441
00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:25.350
<v Speaker 1>So if you get up and you have something </v>
<v Speaker 1>to say and you say it stupidly because </v>

442
00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:29.251
<v Speaker 1>of course you will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because what you know then other people </v>

443
00:23:29.251 --> 00:23:29.710
<v Speaker 1>will tell you where you're wrong and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can learn,</v>

444
00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:31.240
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then everybody can think.</v>

445
00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:34.240
<v Speaker 1>And so what that also means is that to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be free,</v>

446
00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:37.180
<v Speaker 1>to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even to tell the truth means you have to</v>

447
00:23:37.181 --> 00:23:42.181
<v Speaker 1>be free to be stupid and ignorant and </v>
<v Speaker 1>malevolent and bitter because that is </v>

448
00:23:42.181 --> 00:23:46.951
<v Speaker 1>who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is what you are because you're a </v>

449
00:23:46.951 --> 00:23:46.951
<v Speaker 1>fraud.</v>

450
00:23:46.951 --> 00:23:48.370
<v Speaker 2>So the idea that</v>

451
00:23:48.490 --> 00:23:53.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't use your free speech if it's </v>

452
00:23:53.490 --> 00:23:53.490
<v Speaker 1>offensive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

453
00:23:53.490 --> 00:23:55.380
<v Speaker 1>it's an idea that is so you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's naive.</v>

454
00:23:55.410 --> 00:23:57.070
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's malevolence.</v>

455
00:23:57.071 --> 00:24:02.071
<v Speaker 1>It's a real battle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which of the which of those two things </v>

456
00:24:02.071 --> 00:24:04.591
<v Speaker 1>are worse?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would go with malevolence because it </v>

457
00:24:04.591 --> 00:24:07.021
<v Speaker 1>detracts suck at it tax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something that's so absolutely </v>

458
00:24:07.021 --> 00:24:07.021
<v Speaker 1>fundamental.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

459
00:24:07.021 --> 00:24:09.460
<v Speaker 1>well of course people who are speaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>freely are going to be offensive.</v>

460
00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:14.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you ever had a serious discussion </v>

461
00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:14.920
<v Speaker 1>with anyone in your life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm in a serious discussion.</v>

462
00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:17.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean this sort of discussion you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're with your wife,</v>

463
00:24:17.471 --> 00:24:22.471
<v Speaker 1>when you're wondering whether your </v>
<v Speaker 1>marriage is going to survive or you or </v>

464
00:24:22.471 --> 00:24:25.591
<v Speaker 1>with your kids when they've done </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that is really not in their </v>

465
00:24:25.591 --> 00:24:26.170
<v Speaker 1>best longterm interest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean a serious discussion.</v>

466
00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:29.050
<v Speaker 1>You can't even get off the ground </v>
<v Speaker 1>without being offensive.</v>

467
00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:34.350
<v Speaker 1>You can't get off the ground with </v>
<v Speaker 1>defending yourself in a conversation </v>

468
00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:37.681
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't even want to admit how you </v>

469
00:24:37.681 --> 00:24:39.781
<v Speaker 1>feel or how you think to yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you think you can have a difficult </v>

470
00:24:39.781 --> 00:24:43.651
<v Speaker 1>conversation without offending people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that means is you're not having a </v>

471
00:24:43.651 --> 00:24:45.520
<v Speaker 1>difficult conversation because for an </v>
<v Speaker 1>easy conversation,</v>

472
00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:48.370
<v Speaker 1>by definition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one gets upset about that.</v>

473
00:24:48.371 --> 00:24:50.550
<v Speaker 1>There's no real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no real disagreement.</v>

474
00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:54.250
<v Speaker 1>There's and there's no real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real world problem to be solved.</v>

475
00:24:54.550 --> 00:24:59.550
<v Speaker 1>It's just trivial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like discussing last night sports </v>

476
00:24:59.550 --> 00:24:59.680
<v Speaker 1>event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing to it.</v>

477
00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:05.160
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to have a conversation </v>
<v Speaker 1>about something that matters in the </v>

478
00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:06.370
<v Speaker 1>world is made out of what matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good thing to remember.</v>

479
00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:09.010
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to have a discussion </v>
<v Speaker 1>about what matters.</v>

480
00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:14.310
<v Speaker 1>If you're really going to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone is going to be offended by </v>

481
00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:17.891
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if there's something rotten </v>

482
00:25:17.891 --> 00:25:18.680
<v Speaker 1>in the state of Denmark and you happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be the one that is pointing it out,</v>

483
00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:19.970
<v Speaker 1>so then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

484
00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:21.320
<v Speaker 1>your freedom of speech.</v>

485
00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:23.900
<v Speaker 1>That's not about you being able to speak</v>
<v Speaker 1>truth to power.</v>

486
00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:29.080
<v Speaker 1>That's about you being able to chart </v>
<v Speaker 1>your destiny in the world and more than </v>

487
00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:33.491
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's even more important enough because </v>

488
00:25:33.491 --> 00:25:33.491
<v Speaker 1>you know life is hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't get to think.</v>

489
00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:35.540
<v Speaker 1>When you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you walk through your life,</v>

490
00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:40.720
<v Speaker 1>you will fall into a pit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt about that because </v>

491
00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:43.451
<v Speaker 1>that's what thinking is for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to stop you from having any more </v>

492
00:25:43.451 --> 00:25:46.871
<v Speaker 1>catastrophes that are absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary and it's a terribly difficult </v>

493
00:25:46.871 --> 00:25:46.940
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if,</v>

494
00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:52.150
<v Speaker 1>if that's interfered with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't that you don't get to speak </v>

495
00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:55.091
<v Speaker 1>truth to power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that you do not get to act in the </v>

496
00:25:55.091 --> 00:25:58.010
<v Speaker 1>world in a manner that allows you to to </v>
<v Speaker 1>eliminate endless,</v>

497
00:25:58.011 --> 00:26:03.011
<v Speaker 1>unnecessary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hellish suffering and not just for you </v>

498
00:26:03.011 --> 00:26:03.710
<v Speaker 1>but for you and your family and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>

499
00:26:03.711 --> 00:26:05.690
<v Speaker 1>And so the enemies of free speech.</v>

500
00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:09.920
<v Speaker 1>They're the enemies of the process that </v>
<v Speaker 1>turns potential into habitable order.</v>

501
00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:13.520
<v Speaker 1>There are enemies of the divine </v>
<v Speaker 1>principle and worse,</v>

502
00:26:13.521 --> 00:26:15.760
<v Speaker 1>they're their own enemies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

503
00:26:15.761 --> 00:26:17.610
<v Speaker 1>Because this isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

504
00:26:17.611 --> 00:26:19.920
<v Speaker 1>some of us believe in free speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and some of us don't.</v>

505
00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:22.920
<v Speaker 1>It's way deeper than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't believe in free speech,</v>

506
00:26:22.921 --> 00:26:25.530
<v Speaker 1>you don't believe in the implicit </v>
<v Speaker 1>divinity of mankind.</v>

507
00:26:25.531 --> 00:26:27.690
<v Speaker 1>You don't believe in the sovereignty of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the individual.</v>

508
00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:30.300
<v Speaker 1>You don't believe in sovereignty as </v>
<v Speaker 1>such.</v>

509
00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:33.720
<v Speaker 1>You're a totalitarian of some sort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means you attribute all the divine</v>

510
00:26:33.721 --> 00:26:36.780
<v Speaker 1>power to yourself and then we know where</v>
<v Speaker 1>that leads,</v>

511
00:26:36.781 --> 00:26:41.781
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter whether it's on the </v>

512
00:26:41.781 --> 00:26:43.071
<v Speaker 1>right or the left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we had any sense that we took a look </v>

513
00:26:43.071 --> 00:26:45.861
<v Speaker 1>at 20th century history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know exactly things go and we could </v>

514
00:26:45.861 --> 00:26:50.061
<v Speaker 1>easily choose not to go there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when we see someone like Ryan </v>

515
00:26:50.061 --> 00:26:53.420
<v Speaker 1>who's in prison by a reprehensible </v>
<v Speaker 1>dictatorships that we have the gall to </v>

516
00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:57.531
<v Speaker 1>call our lis than what we see is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>system that's not only hell bent on the </v>

517
00:26:59.011 --> 00:27:02.360
<v Speaker 1>destruction of an innocent and good man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

518
00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:07.500
<v Speaker 1>but directly antithetical to everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>that all of us have.</v>

519
00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:12.830
<v Speaker 1>Our society's put forward as necessary </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the continual betterment of being </v>

520
00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:14.020
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

521
00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:23.430
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

522
00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:27.940
<v Speaker 1>Am I being so absolutely appalled by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Western world.</v>

523
00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:32.970
<v Speaker 1>We need response to the attacks of </v>
<v Speaker 1>totalitarians upon our freedom of speech</v>

524
00:27:32.971 --> 00:27:35.400
<v Speaker 1>though the what was done with Solomon </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rushdie,</v>

525
00:27:35.401 --> 00:27:36.900
<v Speaker 1>that was a big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big,</v>

526
00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:38.280
<v Speaker 1>big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big mistake,</v>

527
00:27:38.281 --> 00:27:39.800
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it wasn't rushed.</v>

528
00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:44.840
<v Speaker 1>It was the free speaking artistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>tradition of the West and not only of </v>

529
00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:45.290
<v Speaker 1>the West,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

530
00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:47.040
<v Speaker 1>The free speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>artistic,</v>

531
00:27:47.041 --> 00:27:51.540
<v Speaker 1>creative tradition upon which the cosmos</v>
<v Speaker 1>is properly established.</v>

532
00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:56.720
<v Speaker 1>That's what it was and we all bow down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all bowed down with no resistance </v>

533
00:27:57.011 --> 00:27:59.130
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a massive error.</v>

534
00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:00.990
<v Speaker 1>We're going to pay for that for a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>long time.</v>

535
00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:03.510
<v Speaker 1>We did the same thing with the Danish </v>
<v Speaker 1>cartoons</v>

536
00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:12.170
<v Speaker 1>and you don't want to think about these </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of things is happening far away.</v>

537
00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:15.520
<v Speaker 1>Nothing happens far away when it </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened somewhere else.</v>

538
00:28:15.521 --> 00:28:20.521
<v Speaker 1>It's happening right here too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's why we're all here today </v>

539
00:28:20.521 --> 00:28:21.970
<v Speaker 1>because we recognize that at least on </v>
<v Speaker 1>some level and we have to stop.</v>

540
00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:25.600
<v Speaker 1>We need to stop being so naive about </v>
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>

541
00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:30.660
<v Speaker 1>let's say our moral relativism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to take a look at history and </v>

542
00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:33.841
<v Speaker 1>biology in a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very fundamental way and we need to </v>

543
00:28:33.841 --> 00:28:36.631
<v Speaker 1>really understand what our culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what our culture and cultures everywhere</v>

544
00:28:37.131 --> 00:28:42.131
<v Speaker 1>are predicated on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is the idea that the sovereign </v>

545
00:28:42.131 --> 00:28:45.211
<v Speaker 1>voice of the individual is the power </v>
<v Speaker 1>that casts potential into habitable and </v>

546
00:28:45.401 --> 00:28:47.020
<v Speaker 1>restructures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tyrannical order,</v>

547
00:28:47.021 --> 00:28:49.030
<v Speaker 1>when it needs to be restructured.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

548
00:28:49.031 --> 00:28:54.031
<v Speaker 1>and that's what each of us are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the divine presence in each of </v>

549
00:28:54.031 --> 00:28:56.881
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I do believe that there is no more </v>

550
00:28:56.881 --> 00:28:56.881
<v Speaker 1>fundamental truths than that.</v>

551
00:28:56.881 --> 00:28:58.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that you can dig down </v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath that.</v>

552
00:28:58.901 --> 00:29:03.901
<v Speaker 1>I think that's bedrock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the foundation stone of the </v>

553
00:29:03.901 --> 00:29:04.420
<v Speaker 1>house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the cornerstone of the house,</v>

554
00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:08.170
<v Speaker 1>and it requires everyone to courageously</v>
<v Speaker 1>confront the tyranny,</v>

555
00:29:08.171 --> 00:29:11.920
<v Speaker 1>that's them and the unknown that </v>
<v Speaker 1>surrounds them and to work for their own</v>

556
00:29:11.921 --> 00:29:16.921
<v Speaker 1>benefit and for the benefit of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>families and for the benefit of their </v>

557
00:29:16.921 --> 00:29:19.771
<v Speaker 1>communities and to do everything they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can to benefit the world and to live </v>

558
00:29:19.771 --> 00:29:23.870
<v Speaker 1>with true speech as the highest value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how we sorted out the world and </v>

559
00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:28.341
<v Speaker 1>we can sort it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are sorting it out at a very rapid </v>

560
00:29:28.341 --> 00:29:28.740
<v Speaker 1>rate and we could do that much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much more effectively.</v>

561
00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:33.510
<v Speaker 1>I do believe that it's incumbent on us </v>
<v Speaker 1>to understand the absolutely fundamental</v>

562
00:29:33.511 --> 00:29:38.511
<v Speaker 1>role that these processes take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know we're here today because we all </v>

563
00:29:38.511 --> 00:29:38.580
<v Speaker 1>have at least an intimation of that.</v>

564
00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:43.580
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that there's something about </v>

565
00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:45.261
<v Speaker 1>free speech that's central,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we cannot allow a tax on it to go </v>

566
00:29:45.261 --> 00:29:46.660
<v Speaker 1>unchallenged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter where they occur,</v>

567
00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:52.110
<v Speaker 1>but it's very useful to have an </v>
<v Speaker 1>articulated and to know that this is </v>

568
00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:55.500
<v Speaker 1>bedrock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right and it's not something arbitrary </v>

569
00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:56.200
<v Speaker 1>and it's not a mere game that we're only</v>
<v Speaker 1>playing in the west.</v>

570
00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:57.730
<v Speaker 1>None of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something.</v>

571
00:29:57.790 --> 00:30:02.790
<v Speaker 1>It's the most fundamental truth that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>human race has ever discovered and we </v>

572
00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:06.000
<v Speaker 1>lose it at our absolute peril and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not that it's worse than that,</v>

573
00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:11.010
<v Speaker 1>the peril because there are worse things</v>
<v Speaker 1>than death and the worst things than </v>

574
00:30:11.010 --> 00:30:14.851
<v Speaker 1>death is hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we saw plenty of that in the 20th </v>

575
00:30:14.851 --> 00:30:15.550
<v Speaker 1>century and when we left freedom of </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech go,</v>

576
00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:18.640
<v Speaker 1>that's where we're headed and unless we </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to go there,</v>

577
00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:20.760
<v Speaker 1>then we should stop aiming for.</v>

578
00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:29.830
<v Speaker 2>Thank you,</v>

579
00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:38.780
<v Speaker 1>so thank you very much for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>invitation.</v>

580
00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:39.930
<v Speaker 1>Can I?</v>

581
00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:45.630
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
