1
00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:06.980
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>today we're going to talk about you and</v>

2
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.830
<v Speaker 1>I find that tremendously entertaining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:14.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

4
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure I ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've ever read anyone is intelligent as</v>

5
00:00:18.421 --> 00:00:19.840
<v Speaker 1>you'll accept,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe need shift.</v>

6
00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:22.363
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

7
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.830
<v Speaker 1>it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's accused of many things such as</v>

8
00:00:26.831 --> 00:00:31.210
<v Speaker 1>starting a new religion by some rather</v>
<v Speaker 1>unscrupulous biographers.</v>

9
00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.500
<v Speaker 1>But what he did was actually far more</v>
<v Speaker 1>radical than anything he's ever been</v>

10
00:00:35.501 --> 00:00:38.050
<v Speaker 1>accused of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One other thing I should tell you too is</v>

11
00:00:38.051 --> 00:00:40.130
<v Speaker 1>young as often been accused of Anti</v>
<v Speaker 1>Semitism,</v>

12
00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.170
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things that came to light</v>
<v Speaker 1>in last year was that he was working as</v>

13
00:00:44.171 --> 00:00:48.100
<v Speaker 1>an agent for the American government</v>
<v Speaker 1>during World War II and frequently set</v>

14
00:00:48.101 --> 00:00:51.610
<v Speaker 1>updates on Hitler psychological</v>
<v Speaker 1>condition to the highest levels of the</v>

15
00:00:51.611 --> 00:00:54.130
<v Speaker 1>American government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He never told anybody about that.</v>

16
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.060
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

17
00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a little hard on all accusations</v>

18
00:00:58.931 --> 00:01:00.280
<v Speaker 1>of antisemitism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

19
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.580
<v Speaker 1>which I've never thought had held any</v>
<v Speaker 1>merit anyways.</v>

20
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.340
<v Speaker 1>So young.</v>

21
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.760
<v Speaker 1>He was a strange guy in many ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily imaginative.</v>

22
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:23.410
<v Speaker 1>He could get lost in daydreams and was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendously powerful visualizer.</v>

23
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.420
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of what he discovered</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a consequence of engaging in</v>

24
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.430
<v Speaker 1>longterm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>elaborated and fantasies and in these</v>

25
00:01:41.961 --> 00:01:46.961
<v Speaker 1>fantasies he could have conversations</v>
<v Speaker 1>with figures of his imagination and</v>

26
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.820
<v Speaker 1>communicate with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a client at one point who was a</v>

27
00:01:55.611 --> 00:02:00.611
<v Speaker 1>very prolific dreamer and she can talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>to her characters in your dreams and ask</v>

28
00:02:00.681 --> 00:02:05.450
<v Speaker 1>them what they meant symbolically and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would tell her that was really</v>

29
00:02:05.451 --> 00:02:08.600
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've only seen one person who who was</v>

30
00:02:08.601 --> 00:02:10.100
<v Speaker 1>capable of doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was.</v>

31
00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it helped her that much</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the final analysis,</v>

32
00:02:13.611 --> 00:02:16.100
<v Speaker 1>but she couldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And young was very,</v>

33
00:02:16.101 --> 00:02:19.790
<v Speaker 1>very interested in the depths of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>human imagination.</v>

34
00:02:19.791 --> 00:02:24.410
<v Speaker 1>Now his</v>
<v Speaker 1>body of work</v>

35
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.660
<v Speaker 1>can be viewed as an amalgam of many</v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

36
00:02:29.661 --> 00:02:34.520
<v Speaker 1>but he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had deep knowledge of Latin and Greek</v>

37
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.490
<v Speaker 1>and he'd studied l chemical manuscripts</v>
<v Speaker 1>for many,</v>

38
00:02:40.491 --> 00:02:43.700
<v Speaker 1>many years as an older man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he was very interested in the</v>

39
00:02:43.701 --> 00:02:47.450
<v Speaker 1>emergence of the idea of science from</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he considered the collective</v>

40
00:02:47.451 --> 00:02:51.170
<v Speaker 1>imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in many ways his primary modern</v>

41
00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:56.171
<v Speaker 1>intellectual influences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say we're Nietzsche and Freud</v>

42
00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:03.100
<v Speaker 1>and you'll really set out some somewhat</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Piaget too,</v>

43
00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.390
<v Speaker 1>address the gap between religion and</v>
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>

44
00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.450
<v Speaker 1>but he did it for different reasons than</v>
<v Speaker 1>piaget.</v>

45
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.270
<v Speaker 1>You'll took niches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comments about the death of God very</v>

46
00:03:16.271 --> 00:03:19.450
<v Speaker 1>seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things need shape</v>

47
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.900
<v Speaker 1>predicted at the end of the 19th century</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that there were going to be two</v>

48
00:03:26.261 --> 00:03:29.860
<v Speaker 1>major consequences of the collapse of</v>
<v Speaker 1>formal religious belief.</v>

49
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.200
<v Speaker 1>He believed that that would lead people</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a morally relativistic condition that</v>

50
00:03:35.201 --> 00:03:39.910
<v Speaker 1>would prove psychologically intolerable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you adopt a morally</v>

51
00:03:39.911 --> 00:03:43.210
<v Speaker 1>relativist position and you take it to</v>
<v Speaker 1>its final conclusion,</v>

52
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.430
<v Speaker 1>then everything is of equal value and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no gradient between things.</v>

53
00:03:48.431 --> 00:03:50.380
<v Speaker 1>There's no better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no worse.</v>

54
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.420
<v Speaker 1>And in the final analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>

55
00:03:52.421 --> 00:03:54.010
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no good and there's no evil.</v>

56
00:03:54.011 --> 00:03:58.840
<v Speaker 1>And the problem with that is you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually orient yourself in a world that</v>

57
00:03:58.841 --> 00:04:02.290
<v Speaker 1>has those properties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because in order to act as we've already</v>

58
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.410
<v Speaker 1>talked about with regards to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cybernetic models,</v>

59
00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.650
<v Speaker 1>you have to be aiming at something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's better than what you have now.</v>

60
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.080
<v Speaker 1>Or there's no reason to expend the</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy.</v>

61
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.590
<v Speaker 1>And so you need the gradient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need a value differentiation in</v>

62
00:04:14.591 --> 00:04:19.591
<v Speaker 1>order to act and niches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Analysis was predicated on the idea that</v>

63
00:04:22.341 --> 00:04:26.540
<v Speaker 1>if the value hierarchy collapsed well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only would people not be motivated</v>

64
00:04:26.541 --> 00:04:29.900
<v Speaker 1>to do anything anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they would also be extraordinarily</v>

65
00:04:29.901 --> 00:04:34.280
<v Speaker 1>confused and depressed because the value</v>
<v Speaker 1>would go out of their life and the</v>

66
00:04:34.281 --> 00:04:38.000
<v Speaker 1>consequence of that would be that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>would become somewhat nihilistic or</v>

67
00:04:38.001 --> 00:04:42.710
<v Speaker 1>maybe absolutely nihilistic or that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>would turn to ideological rigid</v>

68
00:04:42.711 --> 00:04:45.860
<v Speaker 1>ideological systems as a replacement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

69
00:04:45.861 --> 00:04:46.694
<v Speaker 1>what niche him</v>

70
00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.760
<v Speaker 1>offered as an alternative to that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>that human beings could create their own</v>

71
00:04:52.761 --> 00:04:55.850
<v Speaker 1>values,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so his idea was that the superman,</v>

72
00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.280
<v Speaker 1>the overmanned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on how you look at it,</v>

73
00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:03.670
<v Speaker 1>would be the person who was capable of</v>
<v Speaker 1>transcending the value list universe</v>

74
00:05:05.991 --> 00:05:10.991
<v Speaker 1>that the decline of religion had left</v>
<v Speaker 1>with us and creating their own values as</v>

75
00:05:11.001 --> 00:05:16.001
<v Speaker 1>a conscious act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem with that is that it isn't</v>

76
00:05:17.391 --> 00:05:22.040
<v Speaker 1>obvious that you can create your own</v>
<v Speaker 1>values as a conscious act because it's</v>

77
00:05:22.041 --> 00:05:24.650
<v Speaker 1>not obvious that values are consciously</v>
<v Speaker 1>create it,</v>

78
00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.420
<v Speaker 1>and I think this is why the</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalysts had so much to add to the</v>

79
00:05:29.421 --> 00:05:33.170
<v Speaker 1>philosophical debate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least the philosophical debate that</v>

80
00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.580
<v Speaker 1>developed to the point of Nietzsche's</v>
<v Speaker 1>observations.</v>

81
00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.940
<v Speaker 1>When Freud entered the scene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of the unconscious was in the</v>

82
00:05:43.941 --> 00:05:46.430
<v Speaker 1>air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Freud formalized it to a much</v>

83
00:05:46.431 --> 00:05:51.020
<v Speaker 1>greater degree than anyone else had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Freud's theory really is deeply</v>

84
00:05:51.021 --> 00:05:51.854
<v Speaker 1>biological.</v>

85
00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:52.850
<v Speaker 1>You know his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his.</v>

86
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:55.970
<v Speaker 1>It's biological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's social as well,</v>

87
00:05:55.971 --> 00:06:00.680
<v Speaker 1>but his proposition proposition that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is an id is fundamentally the</v>

88
00:06:00.681 --> 00:06:05.420
<v Speaker 1>proposition that you're not necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 1>your consciousness for sure is not the</v>

89
00:06:05.421 --> 00:06:07.820
<v Speaker 1>master in its own house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

90
00:06:07.821 --> 00:06:11.690
<v Speaker 1>I think part of the reason that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to go after Freud,</v>

91
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.320
<v Speaker 1>there's a variety of reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of them is that modern people</v>

92
00:06:15.321 --> 00:06:19.820
<v Speaker 1>basically accept radical Freud and</v>
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions more or less as givens.</v>

93
00:06:19.821 --> 00:06:22.430
<v Speaker 1>Now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so if you're a brilliant thinker and</v>

94
00:06:22.431 --> 00:06:27.431
<v Speaker 1>your thought permeates the society to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the point where your most radical</v>

95
00:06:27.441 --> 00:06:32.270
<v Speaker 1>propositions are accepted by everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of it's really left or your errors,</v>

96
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:35.940
<v Speaker 1>and so it's easy to concentrate on</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud's errors because we've already</v>

97
00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:39.380
<v Speaker 1>digested everything he had to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was particularly profound.</v>

98
00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:42.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't imagine perhaps I'm wrong,</v>

99
00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:47.570
<v Speaker 1>but I don't imagine that there's anyone</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this room to whom the news that many</v>

100
00:06:47.571 --> 00:06:52.040
<v Speaker 1>of your motivations aren't conscious</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes as a surprise.</v>

101
00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even psychologists have admitted that in</v>

102
00:06:55.221 --> 00:06:56.600
<v Speaker 1>the last 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

103
00:06:56.601 --> 00:06:58.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they talk about the cognitive</v>

104
00:06:58.101 --> 00:07:02.810
<v Speaker 1>unconscious with which I think is a real</v>
<v Speaker 1>slight of hand maneuver to stop them</v>

105
00:07:02.811 --> 00:07:06.380
<v Speaker 1>from having to Credit Freud with his</v>
<v Speaker 1>discoveries.</v>

106
00:07:06.381 --> 00:07:09.920
<v Speaker 1>And I also think that Freud's notion of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the unconscious is far more</v>

107
00:07:09.921 --> 00:07:14.330
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated than the cognitive</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists notion because Freud viewed</v>

108
00:07:14.331 --> 00:07:18.770
<v Speaker 1>the unconscious as a place that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically populated by fragmented</v>

109
00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:22.880
<v Speaker 1>personalities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not cognitive schemes of one form or</v>

110
00:07:22.881 --> 00:07:24.200
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Processes,</v>

111
00:07:24.201 --> 00:07:27.400
<v Speaker 1>but things that were like living beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

112
00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:28.220
<v Speaker 1>when you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

113
00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:31.340
<v Speaker 1>are there living beings in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious and the answer to that is,</v>

114
00:07:31.341 --> 00:07:33.140
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you alive or not?</v>

115
00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:36.350
<v Speaker 1>And you're alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're composed of living</v>

116
00:07:36.351 --> 00:07:40.610
<v Speaker 1>subcomponents and they're not machines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least not in any way that we</v>

117
00:07:40.611 --> 00:07:43.070
<v Speaker 1>understand machines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're fragmentary,</v>

118
00:07:43.071 --> 00:07:45.500
<v Speaker 1>subpersonalities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and each of them have their own</v>

119
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:50.420
<v Speaker 1>worldview and rationalizations and</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional structure and goals.</v>

120
00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:54.350
<v Speaker 1>And so that's why when you get hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see the world through the eyes of a</v>

121
00:07:54.351 --> 00:07:58.460
<v Speaker 1>hungry person and you think thoughts</v>
<v Speaker 1>about food and your emotional reactions</v>

122
00:07:58.461 --> 00:08:01.250
<v Speaker 1>depend on whether food is available or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it isn't,</v>

123
00:08:01.251 --> 00:08:04.310
<v Speaker 1>and maybe whether or not the food you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want is available and whether it isn't</v>

124
00:08:04.311 --> 00:08:07.610
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's nature,</v>

125
00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:12.110
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imposing its necessities on you as a</v>

126
00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:14.930
<v Speaker 1>living being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for Freud,</v>

127
00:08:14.931 --> 00:08:19.460
<v Speaker 1>that was the end and Freud thought of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Ed really as something that was</v>

128
00:08:19.461 --> 00:08:23.870
<v Speaker 1>primordial and primitive and he and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

129
00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.340
<v Speaker 1>and that's one of the things that really</v>
<v Speaker 1>separated him from you.</v>

130
00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:33.920
<v Speaker 1>And I think young is much more accurate</v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

131
00:08:33.921 --> 00:08:35.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the perspective of evolutionary</v>

132
00:08:35.841 --> 00:08:36.980
<v Speaker 1>psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

133
00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:42.340
<v Speaker 1>I think he's radically underestimated as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a thinker whose thought was unbelievably</v>

134
00:08:42.981 --> 00:08:46.820
<v Speaker 1>deeply grounded in biology and like</v>
<v Speaker 1>young was a remarkable person because</v>

135
00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:51.830
<v Speaker 1>his notion of history and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship between history and the</v>

136
00:08:51.831 --> 00:08:56.340
<v Speaker 1>human psyche,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what covered spans time that we're</v>

137
00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:00.630
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>until modern historians and evolutionary</v>

138
00:09:00.631 --> 00:09:04.770
<v Speaker 1>psychologist started to talk about deep</v>
<v Speaker 1>time and the fact that you know,</v>

139
00:09:04.771 --> 00:09:09.390
<v Speaker 1>the entire 4 billion year history of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world is in some sense relevant to us</v>

140
00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:11.940
<v Speaker 1>talk to us as beings or at least the 3</v>
<v Speaker 1>billion,</v>

141
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.090
<v Speaker 1>three point 5 billion year history that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's been life on the planet.</v>

142
00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:21.360
<v Speaker 1>Ancient history for European</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophers was like 500 to 2000 years</v>

143
00:09:21.361 --> 00:09:26.361
<v Speaker 1>ago and young thought way past that way</v>
<v Speaker 1>back farther than that and started to</v>

144
00:09:26.761 --> 00:09:31.080
<v Speaker 1>take into serious account the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are the origins of our psyche.</v>

145
00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:35.130
<v Speaker 1>The ground of our psyche is deeply</v>
<v Speaker 1>biological and that it's an emergent</v>

146
00:09:35.131 --> 00:09:36.780
<v Speaker 1>property.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for Freud,</v>

147
00:09:36.781 --> 00:09:39.990
<v Speaker 1>Freud's idea of the unconscious is</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhat difficult to understand because</v>

148
00:09:39.991 --> 00:09:42.150
<v Speaker 1>there's sort of two elements to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the ID,</v>

149
00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:47.540
<v Speaker 1>which is the source of primordial</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation and Freud concentrated mostly</v>

150
00:09:47.611 --> 00:09:50.880
<v Speaker 1>on aggression and sexuality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason he concentrated on those</v>

151
00:09:50.881 --> 00:09:52.770
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although we concentrated on what he</v>

152
00:09:52.771 --> 00:09:54.810
<v Speaker 1>called the death instinct later in his</v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

153
00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:59.610
<v Speaker 1>the reason he concentrated on those two</v>
<v Speaker 1>primarily wasn't because he regarded</v>

154
00:09:59.611 --> 00:10:03.390
<v Speaker 1>them necessarily as the most compelling</v>
<v Speaker 1>of motivations,</v>

155
00:10:03.391 --> 00:10:08.070
<v Speaker 1>but he regarded those motivations as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ones that were most difficult for most</v>

156
00:10:08.071 --> 00:10:11.550
<v Speaker 1>people to integrate successfully into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the social world.</v>

157
00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:17.300
<v Speaker 1>So he thought that they were most likely</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be repressed and therefore under</v>

158
00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:21.120
<v Speaker 1>developed and immature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's.</v>

159
00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:26.700
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a reasonable proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that modern people would have to</v>

160
00:10:26.701 --> 00:10:31.380
<v Speaker 1>add eating to that because since the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time of Freud we've gone,</v>

161
00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:36.410
<v Speaker 1>I would say from a high proportion of</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexually related pathologies to a very,</v>

162
00:10:37.561 --> 00:10:39.870
<v Speaker 1>very high proportion of eating related</v>
<v Speaker 1>pathologies.</v>

163
00:10:39.871 --> 00:10:42.810
<v Speaker 1>But that's in some sense beside the</v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

164
00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:46.020
<v Speaker 1>So that's one part of the Freudian</v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious,</v>

165
00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:49.770
<v Speaker 1>sort of an implicit unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the other part of the Freudian</v>

166
00:10:49.771 --> 00:10:54.420
<v Speaker 1>unconscious is those things that have</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened to you that you've repressed</v>

167
00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:58.650
<v Speaker 1>because you don't like what they imply.</v>

168
00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:02.380
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are very different kinds of</v>

169
00:11:02.381 --> 00:11:05.080
<v Speaker 1>unconscious because one of them is</v>
<v Speaker 1>dependent on your experience.</v>

170
00:11:05.081 --> 00:11:08.170
<v Speaker 1>And the other isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you could think of young actually as</v>

171
00:11:08.171 --> 00:11:09.070
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

172
00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:14.430
<v Speaker 1>a deep archeologist of the ID</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Freud,</v>

173
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:17.600
<v Speaker 1>Freud thought about the and sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>primordial terms.</v>

174
00:11:17.601 --> 00:11:20.870
<v Speaker 1>So his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his angry id would be,</v>

175
00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:26.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a beast that's out of control.</v>

176
00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:32.050
<v Speaker 1>But you</v>
<v Speaker 1>recognize that the unconscious was far</v>

177
00:11:33.411 --> 00:11:38.411
<v Speaker 1>more sophisticated in many ways than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious parts of your being and that</v>

178
00:11:41.361 --> 00:11:44.630
<v Speaker 1>it guided your adaptation in ways that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't understand</v>

179
00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:48.350
<v Speaker 1>and that those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ways in which had guarded your</v>

180
00:11:48.351 --> 00:11:50.360
<v Speaker 1>adaptation and structured your</v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding,</v>

181
00:11:50.361 --> 00:11:55.361
<v Speaker 1>we're universal hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>biological and</v>

182
00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:03.360
<v Speaker 1>far more sophisticated than a somewhat</v>
<v Speaker 1>primordial notion of biological drive</v>

183
00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:05.433
<v Speaker 1>might indicate.</v>

184
00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:07.773
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

185
00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:10.540
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that you might</v>
<v Speaker 1>consider,</v>

186
00:12:10.541 --> 00:12:12.850
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that from the union perspective,</v>

187
00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.380
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the forces that ancient people</v>
<v Speaker 1>consider diabetes.</v>

188
00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:19.383
<v Speaker 2>We're</v>

189
00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:24.130
<v Speaker 1>personified representations of</v>
<v Speaker 1>instinctual systems.</v>

190
00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:25.330
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

191
00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:27.610
<v Speaker 1>here's a way of thinking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is the way of thinking about</v>

192
00:12:27.611 --> 00:12:31.210
<v Speaker 1>the collective unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is humans in some sense,</v>

193
00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:33.730
<v Speaker 1>young's replacement term for the fraud</v>
<v Speaker 1>and ID.</v>

194
00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:37.770
<v Speaker 1>So Mars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

195
00:12:37.771 --> 00:12:40.130
<v Speaker 1>is the god of war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roman God of war.</v>

196
00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:43.100
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

197
00:12:43.101 --> 00:12:46.570
<v Speaker 1>what does it mean for there to be a god</v>
<v Speaker 1>of war?</v>

198
00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:49.550
<v Speaker 1>And the answer or Venus is the god of</v>
<v Speaker 1>love actually,</v>

199
00:12:49.551 --> 00:12:50.210
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

200
00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:52.340
<v Speaker 1>of sexual attraction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more particularly,</v>

201
00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:57.110
<v Speaker 1>or have sexual possession,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is even a better way of thinking</v>

202
00:12:57.111 --> 00:12:59.720
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you say,</v>

203
00:12:59.721 --> 00:13:01.970
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would people conceptualize of those</v>

204
00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:07.430
<v Speaker 1>phenomena as gods?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Greek set,</v>

205
00:13:07.431 --> 00:13:09.410
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that human beings were the play things</v>

206
00:13:09.411 --> 00:13:10.370
<v Speaker 1>of the gods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

207
00:13:10.371 --> 00:13:11.810
<v Speaker 1>that's what Shakespeare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

208
00:13:11.811 --> 00:13:12.960
<v Speaker 1>that was Shakespeare who said that?</v>

209
00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:17.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's one way of thinking about it.</v>

210
00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:23.050
<v Speaker 1>What's older you or aggression?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now answer to that is,</v>

211
00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:26.720
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're 23 and the system that mediates</v>

212
00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:31.750
<v Speaker 1>biological aggression in mammals and</v>
<v Speaker 1>their progenitors is tens of millions of</v>

213
00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:38.950
<v Speaker 1>years old and if you think you control</v>
<v Speaker 1>it rather than the other way around,</v>

214
00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:43.370
<v Speaker 1>you're diluted about your central</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>

215
00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:47.300
<v Speaker 1>Part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of it is that you don't control it</v>

216
00:13:47.301 --> 00:13:50.360
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens is that you never go</v>

217
00:13:50.361 --> 00:13:54.650
<v Speaker 1>anywhere where you need to use it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that happens to</v>

218
00:13:54.651 --> 00:13:56.420
<v Speaker 1>soldiers in war time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

219
00:13:56.421 --> 00:14:01.190
<v Speaker 1>is they go somewhere where they could</v>
<v Speaker 1>use it and out it comes and the</v>

220
00:14:01.191 --> 00:14:05.120
<v Speaker 1>consequence of its emergencies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so traumatic that they develop</v>

221
00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:08.330
<v Speaker 1>posttraumatic stress disorder because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they observe themselves doing things</v>

222
00:14:08.331 --> 00:14:12.320
<v Speaker 1>that are hyper aggressive that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>could have never imagined that someone</v>

223
00:14:12.321 --> 00:14:16.510
<v Speaker 1>like them could have manifested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you think,</v>

224
00:14:16.511 --> 00:14:18.490
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about Venus as a goddess?</v>

225
00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:21.130
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you fall in love with someone</v>

226
00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:23.670
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who</v>

227
00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:27.700
<v Speaker 1>is that a choice?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't look like a choice.</v>

228
00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:30.430
<v Speaker 1>If it's a choice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's often an incredibly self</v>

229
00:14:30.431 --> 00:14:35.431
<v Speaker 1>destructive and idiotic choice and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>often one that ruins people's entire</v>

230
00:14:35.651 --> 00:14:39.100
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more like a state of possession and</v>

231
00:14:39.101 --> 00:14:39.761
<v Speaker 1>then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

232
00:14:39.761 --> 00:14:41.380
<v Speaker 1>possession by what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

233
00:14:41.381 --> 00:14:46.000
<v Speaker 1>it's a dynamic living system and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>also immortal in some sense,</v>

234
00:14:46.001 --> 00:14:48.730
<v Speaker 1>which is another reason why</v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualizing it as a daddy makes</v>

235
00:14:48.731 --> 00:14:52.730
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean the phenomena of love,</v>

236
00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:57.290
<v Speaker 1>which is the manifestation of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>complex biological system,</v>

237
00:14:57.291 --> 00:15:01.220
<v Speaker 1>will be alarm long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will be around long after you're gone</v>

238
00:15:01.221 --> 00:15:06.221
<v Speaker 1>and was there long before you showed up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when it manifests itself,</v>

239
00:15:06.531 --> 00:15:11.240
<v Speaker 1>so to speak within you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're possessed by it and you do its</v>

240
00:15:11.241 --> 00:15:15.800
<v Speaker 1>bidding and you may do its bidding</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite what you most deeply want.</v>

241
00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:20.570
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>modern people tend to think that the</v>

242
00:15:20.571 --> 00:15:25.571
<v Speaker 1>conscious parts of their brain that say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or let's say the more newly evolved</v>

243
00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:29.750
<v Speaker 1>elements of their brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we don't actually know what the</v>

244
00:15:29.751 --> 00:15:34.751
<v Speaker 1>relationship is between consciousness</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the newly developed parts of the</v>

245
00:15:35.061 --> 00:15:36.950
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The assumption is often made that the</v>

246
00:15:36.951 --> 00:15:41.951
<v Speaker 1>reason we're conscious is because we've</v>
<v Speaker 1>developed a very spectacular cortical</v>

247
00:15:42.261 --> 00:15:46.280
<v Speaker 1>cap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but consciousness appears to be far</v>

248
00:15:46.281 --> 00:15:50.150
<v Speaker 1>older than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's an erroneous assumption.</v>

249
00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:54.830
<v Speaker 1>But we do tend to believe that the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>complex and sophisticated parts of our</v>

250
00:15:54.831 --> 00:15:58.880
<v Speaker 1>brain are the cortical cap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the complex cortical cap that's quite</v>

251
00:15:58.881 --> 00:16:03.650
<v Speaker 1>enlarged in human beings relative to our</v>
<v Speaker 1>body size because it's the most.</v>

252
00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:08.770
<v Speaker 1>It's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the newest systems and it's also</v>

253
00:16:08.991 --> 00:16:13.280
<v Speaker 1>part of the systems that allow us to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>such things as communicate with language</v>

254
00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:18.200
<v Speaker 1>and think in abstract symbols.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's a different way of thinking</v>

255
00:16:18.201 --> 00:16:20.120
<v Speaker 1>about this from a biological</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>

256
00:16:20.121 --> 00:16:24.470
<v Speaker 1>and that is what makes you think the</v>
<v Speaker 1>newest system is the most sophisticated</v>

257
00:16:24.471 --> 00:16:27.890
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you assume that the oldest</v>

258
00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:32.300
<v Speaker 1>system is the most sophisticated one</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's been around for a while.</v>

259
00:16:32.301 --> 00:16:36.140
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mechanism in in your neurological,</v>

260
00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:41.510
<v Speaker 1>the mechanism that underlies your</v>
<v Speaker 1>conception of your relationship to the</v>

261
00:16:41.511 --> 00:16:43.370
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

262
00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:49.620
<v Speaker 1>is at least 300 million years old and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason it's lasted 300 million years</v>

263
00:16:51.771 --> 00:16:56.771
<v Speaker 1>is because it knows what it's doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far older than your parts of the</v>

264
00:16:58.711 --> 00:17:03.711
<v Speaker 1>brain that make you conscious in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically human way and it's so</v>

265
00:17:03.751 --> 00:17:07.230
<v Speaker 1>deeply embedded in your brain in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense that you have almost no voluntary</v>

266
00:17:07.231 --> 00:17:09.300
<v Speaker 1>control over it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why,</v>

267
00:17:09.301 --> 00:17:11.460
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that happens to people</v>

268
00:17:11.461 --> 00:17:16.461
<v Speaker 1>who are depressed is that the system</v>
<v Speaker 1>that reports their dominance,</v>

269
00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:19.260
<v Speaker 1>dominance status</v>

270
00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:24.040
<v Speaker 1>reports that they're low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

271
00:17:24.041 --> 00:17:26.140
<v Speaker 1>sometimes that's true because they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>not depressed.</v>

272
00:17:26.141 --> 00:17:29.170
<v Speaker 1>They just have an awful life and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually at the bottom of the dominance</v>

273
00:17:29.171 --> 00:17:30.730
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's not the same as being</v>

274
00:17:30.731 --> 00:17:33.530
<v Speaker 1>depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes it malfunctioned,</v>

275
00:17:33.531 --> 00:17:38.531
<v Speaker 1>so someone who's competent and well</v>
<v Speaker 1>situated in life and who appears to have</v>

276
00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:43.770
<v Speaker 1>everything that a person could possibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>desire in order to have a decent and</v>

277
00:17:44.801 --> 00:17:48.210
<v Speaker 1>meaningful and positive life are still</v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophic,</v>

278
00:17:48.211 --> 00:17:50.610
<v Speaker 1>really depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what seems to happen in those</v>

279
00:17:50.611 --> 00:17:54.690
<v Speaker 1>circumstances is that the dominance</v>
<v Speaker 1>counter for one reason or another,</v>

280
00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:59.040
<v Speaker 1>is acting as if they're incredibly low</v>
<v Speaker 1>status when they're in fact not.</v>

281
00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:02.310
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's a good definition of</v>
<v Speaker 1>clinical depression.</v>

282
00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:06.840
<v Speaker 1>I also think that part of the reason</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's mixed results with regards</v>

283
00:18:06.841 --> 00:18:11.130
<v Speaker 1>to antidepressant trials is because</v>
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants don't help you if you're</v>

284
00:18:11.131 --> 00:18:12.900
<v Speaker 1>at the bottom of the dominance</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>

285
00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:14.520
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how good they.</v>

286
00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:18.540
<v Speaker 1>You're not depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just have a terrible life that is</v>

287
00:18:18.541 --> 00:18:22.710
<v Speaker 1>not the same thing and they need to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>carefully distinguished.</v>

288
00:18:22.711 --> 00:18:27.120
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're unemployed and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>facing the loss of your home and maybe</v>

289
00:18:27.121 --> 00:18:29.490
<v Speaker 1>your partner's going to leave you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>your children hate you,</v>

290
00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:32.790
<v Speaker 1>an antidepressant is very unlikely to</v>
<v Speaker 1>fix that.</v>

291
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.000
<v Speaker 1>Now to the degree that misbehavior on</v>
<v Speaker 1>your part called caused by impulsivity</v>

292
00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:43.410
<v Speaker 1>and increased aggression and decreased</v>
<v Speaker 1>mood because of your reaction to that</v>

293
00:18:43.411 --> 00:18:48.300
<v Speaker 1>circumstances is making it worse than</v>
<v Speaker 1>the antidepressant might help you and</v>

294
00:18:48.301 --> 00:18:52.350
<v Speaker 1>maybe the antidepressant will help you</v>
<v Speaker 1>regain enough cognitive control so that</v>

295
00:18:52.351 --> 00:18:54.870
<v Speaker 1>you can plan your way out of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>

296
00:18:55.290 --> 00:19:00.290
<v Speaker 1>but as a medication in and of itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no possible way it can lift you</v>

297
00:19:00.361 --> 00:19:03.780
<v Speaker 1>out of those often catastrophic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>complex and disintegrating</v>

298
00:19:03.781 --> 00:19:08.781
<v Speaker 1>circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if your life is fine but you</v>

299
00:19:08.851 --> 00:19:11.100
<v Speaker 1>feel terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

300
00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:14.070
<v Speaker 1>it's much more likely that an</v>
<v Speaker 1>antidepressant can help with that</v>

301
00:19:14.071 --> 00:19:17.010
<v Speaker 1>because in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it's going to do is to readjust</v>

302
00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:20.500
<v Speaker 1>your dominance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reporting of your dominance counter,</v>

303
00:19:20.501 --> 00:19:23.520
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the level that's appropriate for your</v>

304
00:19:23.521 --> 00:19:25.710
<v Speaker 1>level of competence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really what you want.</v>

305
00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:28.290
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people say you should have high self</v>

306
00:19:28.291 --> 00:19:30.960
<v Speaker 1>esteem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say idiot say that you should</v>

307
00:19:30.961 --> 00:19:32.670
<v Speaker 1>have high self esteem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a.</v>

308
00:19:32.671 --> 00:19:37.671
<v Speaker 1>it's an unbelievably corrupt construct</v>
<v Speaker 1>in many ways because it's actually very,</v>

309
00:19:37.801 --> 00:19:41.850
<v Speaker 1>very highly correlated with baseline</v>
<v Speaker 1>levels of neuroticism negatively,</v>

310
00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:45.150
<v Speaker 1>which is a fundamental personality</v>
<v Speaker 1>traits and baseline levels of</v>

311
00:19:45.151 --> 00:19:48.390
<v Speaker 1>extroversion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so someone with lower self esteem is</v>

312
00:19:48.391 --> 00:19:51.420
<v Speaker 1>generally someone who's introverted and</v>
<v Speaker 1>has high levels of negative emotion.</v>

313
00:19:51.421 --> 00:19:54.660
<v Speaker 1>It's a trait like phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't clear at all that calling that</v>

314
00:19:54.661 --> 00:19:57.390
<v Speaker 1>low self esteem has any utility</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever,</v>

315
00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:59.280
<v Speaker 1>but then you also might ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

316
00:19:59.281 --> 00:20:02.910
<v Speaker 1>how much self esteem should you have?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

317
00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:06.720
<v Speaker 1>that's a very complex question because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can clearly have way too much.</v>

318
00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:11.990
<v Speaker 1>That's what would make you a narcissist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would say your self esteem should</v>

319
00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:17.390
<v Speaker 1>be roughly equivalent to the esteem in</v>
<v Speaker 1>which your held by members of your</v>

320
00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:19.070
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>

321
00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:21.720
<v Speaker 1>You know your family and your society</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're judging you,</v>

322
00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:26.670
<v Speaker 1>at least in part on your competence and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't think that you're more</v>

323
00:20:26.671 --> 00:20:30.450
<v Speaker 1>competent than you are and you shouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>think that you're less competent than</v>

324
00:20:30.451 --> 00:20:32.940
<v Speaker 1>you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should think that you're as</v>

325
00:20:32.941 --> 00:20:36.810
<v Speaker 1>competent as you are and sometimes that</v>
<v Speaker 1>means you're not competent at all</v>

326
00:20:36.811 --> 00:20:39.480
<v Speaker 1>because you don't know what you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes it means that you're quite</v>

327
00:20:39.481 --> 00:20:40.560
<v Speaker 1>competent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

328
00:20:40.561 --> 00:20:45.561
<v Speaker 1>I think it's complicated by the fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you should also regard yourself not</v>

329
00:20:45.721 --> 00:20:49.120
<v Speaker 1>only as who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as who you could be.</v>

330
00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:51.850
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so if you're of lowly dominant</v>

331
00:20:51.851 --> 00:20:54.850
<v Speaker 1>status,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which for example in some sense you guys</v>

332
00:20:54.851 --> 00:20:58.000
<v Speaker 1>are because you're young and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>starting your lives,</v>

333
00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:03.640
<v Speaker 1>the fact that there's a lot of potential</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you still are able to manifest</v>

334
00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:08.670
<v Speaker 1>should tilt the self assessment balance</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your favor to a fair degree.</v>

335
00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:13.520
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>

336
00:21:13.521 --> 00:21:18.380
<v Speaker 1>so yoga was very interested in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>depths of the psyche and hit.</v>

337
00:21:18.381 --> 00:21:22.130
<v Speaker 1>For him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The unconscious wasn't a repository of</v>

338
00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:27.760
<v Speaker 1>repressed experiences and it wasn't a</v>
<v Speaker 1>repository of underdeveloped and</v>

339
00:21:28.671 --> 00:21:33.671
<v Speaker 1>irritated biological systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was instead the underlying structure</v>

340
00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:41.140
<v Speaker 1>of consciousness itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you believe that human experience at</v>

341
00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:47.890
<v Speaker 1>as it's consciously manifested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was structured by underlying</v>

342
00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:57.350
<v Speaker 1>patterns of behavior that were specific</v>
<v Speaker 1>and unique to to the,</v>

343
00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:01.860
<v Speaker 1>to the human,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to human kind.</v>

344
00:22:01.861 --> 00:22:06.480
<v Speaker 1>Although shared to some degree with</v>
<v Speaker 1>other animals and then on top of that a</v>

345
00:22:06.481 --> 00:22:09.930
<v Speaker 1>realm of images stick and symbolic</v>
<v Speaker 1>representation,</v>

346
00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:15.680
<v Speaker 1>that in part was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a consequence of representation of those</v>

347
00:22:16.001 --> 00:22:18.790
<v Speaker 1>underlying behaviors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's the way of thinking about it.</v>

348
00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:24.750
<v Speaker 1>We act in a human way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that means,</v>

349
00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:29.490
<v Speaker 1>and we'd been acting in a human way for</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as there's been human beings and</v>

350
00:22:29.491 --> 00:22:32.670
<v Speaker 1>we've been acting in a mammalian way for</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as there's been mammals.</v>

351
00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:35.850
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings are quite peculiar</v>

352
00:22:35.851 --> 00:22:40.380
<v Speaker 1>creatures because not only do we act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we also watch ourselves act and we</v>

353
00:22:40.381 --> 00:22:45.381
<v Speaker 1>represent those actions and you unbelief</v>
<v Speaker 1>that as a consequence of</v>

354
00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.240
<v Speaker 1>us manifesting</v>

355
00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:56.420
<v Speaker 1>a specific set of typically human</v>
<v Speaker 1>behaviors over hundreds of thousands or</v>

356
00:22:57.271 --> 00:23:01.860
<v Speaker 1>perhaps millions of years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We also evolved the cognitive apparatus</v>

357
00:23:01.861 --> 00:23:06.510
<v Speaker 1>that was capable of representing those</v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns of behavior and that cognitive</v>

358
00:23:06.511 --> 00:23:11.160
<v Speaker 1>apparatus expressed the representations</v>
<v Speaker 1>of those fundamental patterns of</v>

359
00:23:11.161 --> 00:23:14.610
<v Speaker 1>behavior in images,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stick and symbolic form,</v>

360
00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:18.810
<v Speaker 1>and the basic images to can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Symbolic form is something like drama.</v>

361
00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:20.910
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would that be?</v>

362
00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:21.630
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

363
00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:24.540
<v Speaker 1>It's obvious in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is drama?</v>

364
00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:30.390
<v Speaker 1>Drama is the representation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the abstract representation of patterns</v>

365
00:23:30.391 --> 00:23:32.730
<v Speaker 1>of behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you do when you go to a</v>

366
00:23:32.731 --> 00:23:36.090
<v Speaker 1>movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you watch people manifest their</v>

367
00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:39.990
<v Speaker 1>characteristic behaviors and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>might know that there's.</v>

368
00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:41.910
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's characteristic</v>

369
00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:46.700
<v Speaker 1>Kwanzaa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unique of behavior that are portrayed in</v>

370
00:23:46.701 --> 00:23:48.950
<v Speaker 1>drama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

371
00:23:48.951 --> 00:23:51.560
<v Speaker 1>there's the bad guy and he wears the</v>
<v Speaker 1>black hat,</v>

372
00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:55.310
<v Speaker 1>know a cowboy movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and whenever you go to a movie,</v>

373
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:58.790
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty clear to you right away who</v>
<v Speaker 1>the good guys are and the bad guys are,</v>

374
00:23:58.791 --> 00:24:03.500
<v Speaker 1>and you accept the distinction between</v>
<v Speaker 1>good and bad guys as an a priority</v>

375
00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:04.880
<v Speaker 1>acceptable distinction.</v>

376
00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:06.140
<v Speaker 1>So you would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

377
00:24:06.141 --> 00:24:09.800
<v Speaker 1>that's the action of an archetype.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What underlies that is the archetypal</v>

378
00:24:09.801 --> 00:24:13.160
<v Speaker 1>story of the hostile brothers and</v>
<v Speaker 1>hostile brothers,</v>

379
00:24:13.161 --> 00:24:14.870
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or Cain and Abel,</v>

380
00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:17.870
<v Speaker 1>which is the story of Cain and Abel in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Genesis,</v>

381
00:24:17.871 --> 00:24:21.670
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is really the second story that that's</v>

382
00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:25.460
<v Speaker 1>in that origin myth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's the first story about real</v>

383
00:24:25.461 --> 00:24:27.440
<v Speaker 1>human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

384
00:24:27.441 --> 00:24:29.090
<v Speaker 1>Because Adam and eve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

385
00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:32.570
<v Speaker 1>we're created by God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas Cain and Abel were born,</v>

386
00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:34.550
<v Speaker 1>the first brothers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

387
00:24:34.551 --> 00:24:35.810
<v Speaker 1>what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

388
00:24:35.811 --> 00:24:38.660
<v Speaker 1>one of them became insanely jealous of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other and murdered him,</v>

389
00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:42.600
<v Speaker 1>so that's a pretty harsh story when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think that you know,</v>

390
00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:43.903
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

391
00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:46.800
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the monotheistic religions of,</v>

392
00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:48.770
<v Speaker 1>of the West,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

393
00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:52.070
<v Speaker 1>put as one of their foundational</v>
<v Speaker 1>stories.</v>

394
00:24:52.071 --> 00:24:57.071
<v Speaker 1>The idea that there is a twin pair of</v>
<v Speaker 1>forces operating the human psyche that</v>

395
00:24:57.741 --> 00:25:02.240
<v Speaker 1>can be conceptualized as brothers who</v>
<v Speaker 1>are murderously opposed to one another.</v>

396
00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:06.990
<v Speaker 1>It's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's part of the reason why that story</v>

397
00:25:06.991 --> 00:25:09.030
<v Speaker 1>hasn't disappeared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so powerful.</v>

398
00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:12.960
<v Speaker 1>It's so shocking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so powerful that it can't</v>

399
00:25:12.961 --> 00:25:15.630
<v Speaker 1>disappear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason for that is that it's</v>

400
00:25:15.631 --> 00:25:18.180
<v Speaker 1>true in a sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

401
00:25:18.181 --> 00:25:23.181
<v Speaker 1>Like it's true that a reasonable drama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not all of them obviously,</v>

402
00:25:23.911 --> 00:25:28.050
<v Speaker 1>but a large proportion of them has a bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy and a good guy.</v>

403
00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:29.490
<v Speaker 1>And then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

404
00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:32.990
<v Speaker 1>what would the archetypes be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

405
00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:37.980
<v Speaker 1>the archetypes would be the ultimate</v>
<v Speaker 1>good guy and the ultimate bad guy,</v>

406
00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:40.620
<v Speaker 1>and there's representations of the</v>

407
00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:44.230
<v Speaker 1>ultimate good guy in the ultimate bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

408
00:25:44.231 --> 00:25:46.990
<v Speaker 1>Young was very influenced by</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity and part of the reason for</v>

409
00:25:46.991 --> 00:25:49.480
<v Speaker 1>that is that he grew up in a state that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was Protestant,</v>

410
00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:54.160
<v Speaker 1>primarily Christian and a number of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>immediate ancestors were pastors,</v>

411
00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:58.600
<v Speaker 1>so he grew up in an atmosphere that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty saturated by religious ideas and</v>

412
00:25:58.601 --> 00:26:01.390
<v Speaker 1>so a lot of his thinking was heavily</v>
<v Speaker 1>influenced by Christianity.</v>

413
00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:06.930
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things he pointed out was</v>
<v Speaker 1>that just like Cain and Abel who are</v>

414
00:26:07.511 --> 00:26:09.520
<v Speaker 1>archetypes in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're archetypes of the.</v>

415
00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:13.420
<v Speaker 1>They're the Old Testament version of</v>
<v Speaker 1>archetypes of the hostile brothers,</v>

416
00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:16.870
<v Speaker 1>Christ and Satan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our archetypes and the reason they're</v>

417
00:26:16.871 --> 00:26:20.470
<v Speaker 1>archetypes is because virtually by</v>
<v Speaker 1>definition,</v>

418
00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:24.010
<v Speaker 1>the satanic symbol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

419
00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:28.180
<v Speaker 1>is a representation of symbolic</v>
<v Speaker 1>representation of everything that's</v>

420
00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:31.330
<v Speaker 1>terrible about human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an archetype.</v>

421
00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:34.330
<v Speaker 1>You can't imagine anything worse than</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

422
00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:36.190
<v Speaker 1>so it's like a limit case.</v>

423
00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:39.040
<v Speaker 1>And then when you go to a movie and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>see bad guys,</v>

424
00:26:39.041 --> 00:26:42.340
<v Speaker 1>you can think of them as partial</v>
<v Speaker 1>approximations of the archetype.</v>

425
00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:45.540
<v Speaker 1>Or you can think about them as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>archetype.</v>

426
00:26:45.541 --> 00:26:49.740
<v Speaker 1>Differentiated in a manner that makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>exposure to the archetype fresh and</v>

427
00:26:49.741 --> 00:26:54.180
<v Speaker 1>interesting because you just don't want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go and see the same old bad guy over</v>

428
00:26:54.181 --> 00:26:58.950
<v Speaker 1>and over and over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to explore the entire complex</v>

429
00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:05.070
<v Speaker 1>behavioral and representational system</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the archetype of the,</v>

430
00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:10.220
<v Speaker 1>of evil in every conceivable situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in the same way you want to explore</v>

431
00:27:10.351 --> 00:27:14.580
<v Speaker 1>the archetype of good and the reason you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to do that in principle,</v>

432
00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:20.660
<v Speaker 1>depending on your motivations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to control the influence of the</v>

433
00:27:24.751 --> 00:27:28.410
<v Speaker 1>factors that underlie the negative</v>
<v Speaker 1>archetype in your life.</v>

434
00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:33.600
<v Speaker 1>And to manifest the factors that</v>
<v Speaker 1>underlie the positive archetype.</v>

435
00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:35.790
<v Speaker 1>And that's why you hope for the good</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

436
00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:39.270
<v Speaker 1>It's also why generally speaking in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>drama,</v>

437
00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:44.400
<v Speaker 1>you embody that good guy while you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching the movie.</v>

438
00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:46.200
<v Speaker 1>So I can give you an example of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

439
00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:50.460
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I learned to do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>my son when I took them to movies</v>

440
00:27:50.461 --> 00:27:54.930
<v Speaker 1>because when he was a little guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took him to fairly intense movies and</v>

441
00:27:54.931 --> 00:27:57.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes too intense,</v>

442
00:27:57.211 --> 00:28:01.050
<v Speaker 1>but I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I taught him when he</v>

443
00:28:01.051 --> 00:28:02.760
<v Speaker 1>was afraid was keep your eye on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hero,</v>

444
00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:05.670
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't be afraid or it's not real.</v>

445
00:28:05.671 --> 00:28:09.870
<v Speaker 1>It's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could easily make a case that had</v>

446
00:28:09.871 --> 00:28:14.580
<v Speaker 1>movie is more real than normal life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would you watch it otherwise?</v>

447
00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:19.590
<v Speaker 1>What a movie is his normal life stripped</v>
<v Speaker 1>of everything that's trivial.</v>

448
00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:23.700
<v Speaker 1>So if you strip a representation of</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that's trivial,</v>

449
00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:25.530
<v Speaker 1>what makes you think that isn't more</v>
<v Speaker 1>real?</v>

450
00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:31.430
<v Speaker 1>So is fiction more real than life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

451
00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:33.570
<v Speaker 1>is abstraction more real than reality?</v>

452
00:28:35.150 --> 00:28:36.800
<v Speaker 1>It certainly is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In many cases.</v>

453
00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:39.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are people who believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

454
00:28:39.051 --> 00:28:43.790
<v Speaker 1>that mathematical representations are</v>
<v Speaker 1>are the most real of phenomena.</v>

455
00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:46.120
<v Speaker 1>They certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a very powerful mathematician,</v>

456
00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:49.100
<v Speaker 1>they certainly become.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or if your society is very powerful</v>

457
00:28:49.101 --> 00:28:51.590
<v Speaker 1>mathematically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it certainly gives you a tremendous</v>

458
00:28:51.591 --> 00:28:55.100
<v Speaker 1>amount of control over your environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea that abstractions aren't</v>

459
00:28:55.101 --> 00:29:00.101
<v Speaker 1>real is that's a silly idea and the idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>that fiction isn't real,</v>

460
00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:05.720
<v Speaker 1>it all that indicates is a confusion</v>
<v Speaker 1>about what constitutes real</v>

461
00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:11.930
<v Speaker 1>movie as a representation of</v>
<v Speaker 1>characteristic behavioral patterns</v>

462
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:16.670
<v Speaker 1>extending across time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it can be a more or less useful,</v>

463
00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:21.290
<v Speaker 1>accurate</v>
<v Speaker 1>distillation of those representations.</v>

464
00:29:21.291 --> 00:29:26.291
<v Speaker 1>And generally what we assume is that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>greater the fictional representation</v>

465
00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:32.420
<v Speaker 1>because we make a distinction between</v>
<v Speaker 1>great fictional representations and you</v>

466
00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:34.880
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>second rate fictional representations.</v>

467
00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:37.070
<v Speaker 1>So Shakespeare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

468
00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:42.490
<v Speaker 1>is a master at exploring the contours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the archetype in a complex,</v>

469
00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:46.120
<v Speaker 1>realistic and useful manner.</v>

470
00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:53.270
<v Speaker 1>Now you'll also believe so that there</v>
<v Speaker 1>were these patterns of behavior and they</v>

471
00:29:53.271 --> 00:29:57.470
<v Speaker 1>would constitute the typical behavioral</v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns of Human Beings.</v>

472
00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:04.180
<v Speaker 1>And then we evolved a system of</v>
<v Speaker 1>representations of those patterns and</v>

473
00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:07.310
<v Speaker 1>that would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would enable us to understand the</v>

474
00:30:07.311 --> 00:30:10.340
<v Speaker 1>patterns in a way that other animals</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't because we're self conscious,</v>

475
00:30:10.341 --> 00:30:12.080
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what does it mean to be self</v>

476
00:30:12.081 --> 00:30:14.810
<v Speaker 1>conscious?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't just mean that you know that</v>

477
00:30:14.811 --> 00:30:18.950
<v Speaker 1>you exist as a separate entity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just a state of conscious</v>

478
00:30:18.951 --> 00:30:23.090
<v Speaker 1>awareness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a knowledge condition you have at</v>

479
00:30:23.091 --> 00:30:28.091
<v Speaker 1>your fingertips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A very large representational storehouse</v>

480
00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:31.580
<v Speaker 1>of abstract knowledge about what human</v>
<v Speaker 1>beings are like.</v>

481
00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:34.910
<v Speaker 1>And that's developed over tens of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years,</v>

482
00:30:34.911 --> 00:30:36.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a collective activity.</v>

483
00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:39.620
<v Speaker 1>The generation of all these stories we</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell about each other.</v>

484
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have ancient stories.</v>

485
00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:44.750
<v Speaker 1>The oldest stories we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

486
00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:49.960
<v Speaker 1>are Mesopotamian stories far as I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the oldest Mesopotamian story,</v>

487
00:30:50.331 --> 00:30:54.110
<v Speaker 1>or one of the oldest Mesopotamian</v>
<v Speaker 1>stories we have is a hero story where</v>

488
00:30:54.111 --> 00:30:56.270
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the God Marduk</v>

489
00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:02.820
<v Speaker 1>fights a great dragon and cuts her into</v>
<v Speaker 1>pieces and makes the world and you might</v>

490
00:31:04.241 --> 00:31:05.074
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

491
00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:10.520
<v Speaker 1>what the Mesopotamians you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean the world's created</v>

492
00:31:10.521 --> 00:31:13.430
<v Speaker 1>over the pieces of a great dragon?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

493
00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:17.930
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a Piagetian idea with a bit of</v>

494
00:31:17.931 --> 00:31:20.450
<v Speaker 1>narrative complexity added to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

495
00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:22.910
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you create the world?</v>

496
00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:26.000
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you confront the unknown and you</v>

497
00:31:26.001 --> 00:31:30.380
<v Speaker 1>transform it into the known or you</v>
<v Speaker 1>confront unexplored territory and you</v>

498
00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:33.440
<v Speaker 1>transform it into explored territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you might say,</v>

499
00:31:33.441 --> 00:31:36.290
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what exactly is the unknown?</v>

500
00:31:36.291 --> 00:31:40.310
<v Speaker 1>Or what exactly is unexplored territory?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as scientists would say,</v>

501
00:31:40.311 --> 00:31:41.180
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

502
00:31:41.181 --> 00:31:44.270
<v Speaker 1>if you walk out in the field that you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>never been in before,</v>

503
00:31:44.810 --> 00:31:48.500
<v Speaker 1>there's soil and material elements and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what's really there.</v>

504
00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:54.720
<v Speaker 1>But that isn't exactly what's really</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

505
00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:59.550
<v Speaker 1>It depends on your timeframe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things I could say about</v>

506
00:31:59.551 --> 00:32:00.510
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

507
00:32:00.511 --> 00:32:05.070
<v Speaker 1>is that if you wander outside the</v>
<v Speaker 1>boundaries of your knowledge,</v>

508
00:32:06.890 --> 00:32:10.460
<v Speaker 1>if you wandered outside the boundaries</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your territory when you were an</v>

509
00:32:10.461 --> 00:32:14.690
<v Speaker 1>animal or when you were a more archaic</v>
<v Speaker 1>human being,</v>

510
00:32:15.050 --> 00:32:18.470
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you are going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>run into something that was going to</v>

511
00:32:18.471 --> 00:32:22.100
<v Speaker 1>tear you apart and eat you was extremely</v>
<v Speaker 1>high.</v>

512
00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:24.500
<v Speaker 1>And so then I could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

513
00:32:24.530 --> 00:32:28.430
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental nature of the unknown is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that which tears you apart in each you</v>

514
00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:30.380
<v Speaker 1>and you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

515
00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:35.440
<v Speaker 1>is that what sort of reality is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say,</v>

516
00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:38.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you hear evolutionary psychologists</v>

517
00:32:38.391 --> 00:32:41.870
<v Speaker 1>talk sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that we evolved on the African</v>

518
00:32:41.871 --> 00:32:46.180
<v Speaker 1>Veldt and now our nervous systems are</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of adapted for that primordial</v>

519
00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:48.560
<v Speaker 1>environment and not really for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>modern environment.</v>

520
00:32:48.561 --> 00:32:51.650
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a mismatch between us in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the modern world.</v>

521
00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:53.960
<v Speaker 1>It's like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's an absolutely</v>

522
00:32:53.961 --> 00:32:58.961
<v Speaker 1>reprehensible theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because we didn't just evolve on</v>

523
00:32:59.421 --> 00:32:59.960
<v Speaker 1>the velt.</v>

524
00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:02.000
<v Speaker 1>We've been evolving for a very long</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

525
00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:04.220
<v Speaker 1>We spent a lot more time in trees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

526
00:33:04.221 --> 00:33:08.390
<v Speaker 1>than we did on the Veldt and while we</v>
<v Speaker 1>were spending time in trees,</v>

527
00:33:08.391 --> 00:33:11.270
<v Speaker 1>a lot of us were eaten by snakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

528
00:33:11.271 --> 00:33:16.010
<v Speaker 1>and so that's another reason why the the</v>
<v Speaker 1>unknown itself is represented as this</v>

529
00:33:16.011 --> 00:33:20.810
<v Speaker 1>terrible predatory reptilian beast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the human being is represented</v>

530
00:33:20.811 --> 00:33:24.770
<v Speaker 1>as that which or the conscious element</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the human being which is represented</v>

531
00:33:24.771 --> 00:33:28.910
<v Speaker 1>by the Mesopotamians as a god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the highest God actually in the</v>

532
00:33:28.911 --> 00:33:31.250
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy of Gods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was a brilliant method,</v>

533
00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:35.840
<v Speaker 1>Mesopotamian realization because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mesopotamians basically concluded in</v>

534
00:33:35.841 --> 00:33:37.790
<v Speaker 1>their drama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their religious drama,</v>

535
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.920
<v Speaker 1>that the highest faculty of the human</v>
<v Speaker 1>being was the capacity to consciously</v>

536
00:33:42.921 --> 00:33:46.820
<v Speaker 1>attend to the unknown and to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>something new out of it.</v>

537
00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:48.920
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a Piagetian idea,</v>

538
00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:50.840
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what piaget was talking</v>

539
00:33:50.841 --> 00:33:55.841
<v Speaker 1>about when he talked about the necessity</v>
<v Speaker 1>of comprehending knowledge as a process</v>

540
00:33:56.601 --> 00:33:58.520
<v Speaker 1>rather than as a collection of fact.</v>

541
00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:00.260
<v Speaker 1>It's a process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the process?</v>

542
00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:05.120
<v Speaker 1>Confront what you don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boldly go where no one has ever gone,</v>

543
00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:06.770
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean Star Trek.</v>

544
00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:11.800
<v Speaker 1>That's where a systematizing minds get</v>
<v Speaker 1>their mythology.</v>

545
00:34:12.630 --> 00:34:14.660
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's rife with mythology and it's</v>

546
00:34:14.661 --> 00:34:17.900
<v Speaker 1>initial statement is a mythological</v>
<v Speaker 1>statement and it's a statement of the</v>

547
00:34:17.901 --> 00:34:22.110
<v Speaker 1>eternal explorer and that's an</v>
<v Speaker 1>archetypal idea and you know,</v>

548
00:34:22.130 --> 00:34:23.180
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

549
00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:27.110
<v Speaker 1>are you still threatened by those</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible things that threatened your</v>

550
00:34:27.111 --> 00:34:30.260
<v Speaker 1>ancestors on the Veldt?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And normally people would say,</v>

551
00:34:30.261 --> 00:34:32.120
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there are no lions,</v>

552
00:34:32.121 --> 00:34:35.330
<v Speaker 1>but that's because they don't get the</v>
<v Speaker 1>categories right.</v>

553
00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:40.720
<v Speaker 1>Lion is a subcategory of unknown</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible thing and you guys are</v>

554
00:34:41.121 --> 00:34:44.120
<v Speaker 1>surrounded by unknown horrible things</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like people have always been</v>

555
00:34:44.121 --> 00:34:48.950
<v Speaker 1>surrounded by unknown horrible things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so because you're just as prone to</v>

556
00:34:48.951 --> 00:34:50.780
<v Speaker 1>disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not quite as prone,</v>

557
00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:55.520
<v Speaker 1>but fundamentally you're a finite being</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's things everywhere that act</v>

558
00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:59.870
<v Speaker 1>in a predatory manner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in relationship to you and you will die.</v>

559
00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:04.150
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea that the material</v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions of our environment have</v>

560
00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:08.830
<v Speaker 1>changed in a qualitative manner since</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time we spent on the belt is an.</v>

561
00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:13.780
<v Speaker 1>It's an error of category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mythological categories of our</v>

562
00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:17.880
<v Speaker 1>categories that represent environmental</v>
<v Speaker 1>entities,</v>

563
00:35:17.881 --> 00:35:20.540
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of which are social that have</v>

564
00:35:20.541 --> 00:35:25.541
<v Speaker 1>existed for vast stretches of time and</v>
<v Speaker 1>which exceed our capacity to detect.</v>

565
00:35:26.331 --> 00:35:31.331
<v Speaker 1>With our census,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so one representation for example is the</v>

566
00:35:31.821 --> 00:35:36.821
<v Speaker 1>great father or the wise old man and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>wise old man of the great father is a</v>

567
00:35:37.501 --> 00:35:39.540
<v Speaker 1>representation of the dominance</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>

568
00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:42.720
<v Speaker 1>Now the problem with the dominance</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy is you can't see it,</v>

569
00:35:43.770 --> 00:35:48.600
<v Speaker 1>but it's there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really there and then figures like</v>

570
00:35:48.601 --> 00:35:51.240
<v Speaker 1>the great mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the terror because most of</v>

571
00:35:51.241 --> 00:35:55.290
<v Speaker 1>the archetypal figures come in pairs a</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive element and a negative element</v>

572
00:35:55.291 --> 00:35:59.760
<v Speaker 1>and that's because virtually everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>that manifests itself to you in a</v>

573
00:35:59.761 --> 00:36:03.540
<v Speaker 1>complex environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're living being takes with one</v>

574
00:36:03.541 --> 00:36:05.640
<v Speaker 1>hand and gives with the other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

575
00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:10.670
<v Speaker 1>so nature is benevolent and kind and</v>
<v Speaker 1>wise and the source of all new knowledge</v>

576
00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:16.430
<v Speaker 1>and also cancer and malarial mosquitoes</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the tetsy fly and the Guinea worm</v>

577
00:36:17.161 --> 00:36:21.450
<v Speaker 1>and all these things that are horrifying</v>
<v Speaker 1>and destructive beyond belief and you're</v>

578
00:36:21.451 --> 00:36:23.280
<v Speaker 1>stuck with both and then society.</v>

579
00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:26.160
<v Speaker 1>We talked about this before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the great father.</v>

580
00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:30.720
<v Speaker 1>On the one hand here you are</v>
<v Speaker 1>benevolently protected by your social</v>

581
00:36:30.721 --> 00:36:32.550
<v Speaker 1>surround.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>

582
00:36:33.570 --> 00:36:38.400
<v Speaker 1>social structures tend towards tyranny</v>
<v Speaker 1>and authoritarianism and they'll press</v>

583
00:36:38.401 --> 00:36:41.250
<v Speaker 1>the individuals within them at the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>time that they sustain their</v>

584
00:36:41.251 --> 00:36:44.040
<v Speaker 1>development,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that's a dichotomous archetype</v>

585
00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:48.780
<v Speaker 1>and then there's the individual who's on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one hand a remarkable and wonderful</v>

586
00:36:48.781 --> 00:36:53.781
<v Speaker 1>creature and on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who's capable of atrocities like</v>

587
00:36:54.571 --> 00:36:57.120
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the characterized the auctions of many</v>

588
00:36:57.121 --> 00:37:01.470
<v Speaker 1>millions of people in the 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are all archetypes.</v>

589
00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:06.990
<v Speaker 1>There are more archetypes than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the archetype of the predatory rep</v>

590
00:37:06.991 --> 00:37:10.950
<v Speaker 1>tail with something to offer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is essentially a dragon is the</v>

591
00:37:10.951 --> 00:37:13.290
<v Speaker 1>most fundamental archetipal</v>
<v Speaker 1>representation.</v>

592
00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:18.270
<v Speaker 1>You found that representation in l</v>
<v Speaker 1>chemical manuscripts mostly in the form</v>

593
00:37:18.271 --> 00:37:21.540
<v Speaker 1>of the Earl burls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a snake that eats its own tail</v>

594
00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:26.190
<v Speaker 1>and it's a symbol of matter and spirit</v>
<v Speaker 1>in union because the snake is sort of</v>

595
00:37:26.250 --> 00:37:30.480
<v Speaker 1>matter and the wings on the snake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dragon make it spirit.</v>

596
00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:35.480
<v Speaker 1>So it's like the fundamental elements of</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality or matter in spirit in some kind</v>

597
00:37:35.521 --> 00:37:37.900
<v Speaker 1>of conjoined,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

598
00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:43.770
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the fundamental task of the human</v>

599
00:37:43.771 --> 00:37:47.250
<v Speaker 1>being is to come to terms with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature of that unknown thing.</v>

600
00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:48.780
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about it this way.</v>

601
00:37:48.781 --> 00:37:52.470
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would ancient people represent the</v>

602
00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:58.040
<v Speaker 1>unknown as such as a Reptilian self</v>
<v Speaker 1>contained reptilian form that was both</v>

603
00:38:00.181 --> 00:38:02.220
<v Speaker 1>spiritual and Matt and material?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

604
00:38:02.221 --> 00:38:07.221
<v Speaker 1>here's the reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First the unknown is dangerous and you</v>

605
00:38:07.861 --> 00:38:12.780
<v Speaker 1>could be at spray so you better have</v>
<v Speaker 1>that representation at hand and then you</v>

606
00:38:12.781 --> 00:38:13.351
<v Speaker 1>might ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

607
00:38:13.351 --> 00:38:16.020
<v Speaker 1>is that really the unknown?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I would say,</v>

608
00:38:16.021 --> 00:38:18.000
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends absolutely on what you mean</v>

609
00:38:18.001 --> 00:38:23.001
<v Speaker 1>by really from a Darwinian perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the best way to conceptualize</v>

610
00:38:23.251 --> 00:38:25.320
<v Speaker 1>the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you might say,</v>

611
00:38:25.321 --> 00:38:28.020
<v Speaker 1>well that doesn't make it real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I might say,</v>

612
00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:30.150
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you sure about that?</v>

613
00:38:30.210 --> 00:38:34.710
<v Speaker 1>Is there anything more real than than</v>
<v Speaker 1>representations derived from Darwinian?</v>

614
00:38:35.890 --> 00:38:37.750
<v Speaker 1>The darwinists would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

615
00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:40.870
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so why does it matter in spirit?</v>

616
00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:43.770
<v Speaker 1>Why is it weighing in and on the ground</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the same time?</v>

617
00:38:43.771 --> 00:38:45.160
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is.</v>

618
00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:48.670
<v Speaker 1>You can also understand this from a phd</v>
<v Speaker 1>and perspective and so that is because</v>

619
00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:54.040
<v Speaker 1>when you encounter the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you separate the material world in the</v>

620
00:38:54.041 --> 00:38:57.460
<v Speaker 1>spiritual world and the spiritual</v>
<v Speaker 1>wilderness is the psychological world</v>

621
00:38:57.820 --> 00:38:59.920
<v Speaker 1>and so what you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you encounter the unknown,</v>

622
00:38:59.921 --> 00:39:04.390
<v Speaker 1>as you parse some of it up into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world and you incorporate other elements</v>

623
00:39:04.391 --> 00:39:08.110
<v Speaker 1>of it into yourself and the best way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about that,</v>

624
00:39:08.111 --> 00:39:11.380
<v Speaker 1>I think from a conceptual perspective so</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes more understandable,</v>

625
00:39:11.381 --> 00:39:16.210
<v Speaker 1>is that what you encounter when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>encounter the unknown is patterned</v>

626
00:39:16.211 --> 00:39:21.211
<v Speaker 1>information and you take some of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>pattern and information into yourself.</v>

627
00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:25.360
<v Speaker 1>Even by doing something as simple as</v>
<v Speaker 1>gripping something you want to pick up</v>

628
00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:29.560
<v Speaker 1>because you're imitating the pattern of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that you want to pick up.</v>

629
00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:34.210
<v Speaker 1>And that's how you're transforming it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Structure into an element of your being.</v>

630
00:39:34.211 --> 00:39:35.920
<v Speaker 1>And so when you're exploring the</v>
<v Speaker 1>unknown,</v>

631
00:39:35.921 --> 00:39:39.490
<v Speaker 1>it's constructivist idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're simultaneously constructing the</v>

632
00:39:39.491 --> 00:39:44.020
<v Speaker 1>world and constructing yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and thus the inference is the unknown is</v>

633
00:39:44.021 --> 00:39:48.490
<v Speaker 1>made out of that which can be parsed out</v>
<v Speaker 1>into psyche and matter.</v>

634
00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:52.150
<v Speaker 1>And it's dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a perfectly reasonable</v>

635
00:39:52.151 --> 00:39:54.820
<v Speaker 1>representation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why it won't go away.</v>

636
00:39:56.170 --> 00:40:01.170
<v Speaker 1>So Young's fundamental contribution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say is the is his analysis of</v>

637
00:40:01.761 --> 00:40:04.570
<v Speaker 1>hero mythology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say that's the fundamental</v>

638
00:40:04.571 --> 00:40:05.830
<v Speaker 1>element of his thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

639
00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:10.330
<v Speaker 1>the relationship between that and Nisha</v>
<v Speaker 1>is fundamentally this Nicha believed</v>

640
00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:12.640
<v Speaker 1>that once the religious systems</v>
<v Speaker 1>collapsed,</v>

641
00:40:12.641 --> 00:40:15.940
<v Speaker 1>we would have to consciously produce our</v>
<v Speaker 1>new set of values.</v>

642
00:40:15.941 --> 00:40:20.941
<v Speaker 1>But young believed that the psyche was</v>
<v Speaker 1>the source of all value and the so that</v>

643
00:40:21.071 --> 00:40:23.890
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't a matter of creating new</v>
<v Speaker 1>values.</v>

644
00:40:24.370 --> 00:40:28.900
<v Speaker 1>It was a matter of discovering the</v>
<v Speaker 1>values that were already lying dormant</v>

645
00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:30.790
<v Speaker 1>and implicit within us.</v>

646
00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:34.120
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the next thing I would say about</v>

647
00:40:34.121 --> 00:40:36.190
<v Speaker 1>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you all know this,</v>

648
00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:41.170
<v Speaker 1>you just don't know you know it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the reasons to be to be</v>

649
00:40:41.290 --> 00:40:46.290
<v Speaker 1>educated from a literary and historical</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective is that you can come to</v>

650
00:40:46.541 --> 00:40:50.620
<v Speaker 1>understand what you already know because</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't understand it,</v>

651
00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:54.670
<v Speaker 1>then there's an element of your being</v>
<v Speaker 1>the element that knows it and acts it</v>

652
00:40:54.671 --> 00:40:56.650
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's another element which is</v>

653
00:40:56.651 --> 00:41:00.610
<v Speaker 1>sort of you as a personality that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely at odds with one another,</v>

654
00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:04.210
<v Speaker 1>and that makes you weak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's it makes you something that's</v>

655
00:41:04.211 --> 00:41:08.140
<v Speaker 1>divided within itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you're doing everything you can as a</v>

656
00:41:08.141 --> 00:41:12.550
<v Speaker 1>general rule to incorporate this</v>
<v Speaker 1>information now for a long time.</v>

657
00:41:12.551 --> 00:41:17.230
<v Speaker 1>It seems as if as long as we acted it</v>
<v Speaker 1>out and represented it symbolically and</v>

658
00:41:17.231 --> 00:41:21.010
<v Speaker 1>didn't argue about the assumptions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was more or less okay,</v>

659
00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:26.340
<v Speaker 1>but we're past that now and in order for</v>
<v Speaker 1>us to benefit from the same protective</v>

660
00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:35.120
<v Speaker 1>structures that our ancestors benefited</v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

661
00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:38.510
<v Speaker 1>we now have to understand what they mean</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciously.</v>

662
00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:43.700
<v Speaker 1>And that's really what young was up to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What he was really trying to do was to</v>

663
00:41:43.701 --> 00:41:47.900
<v Speaker 1>resurrect deep religious representations</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the dead,</v>

664
00:41:47.901 --> 00:41:51.110
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to make them conscious so people</v>

665
00:41:51.111 --> 00:41:55.330
<v Speaker 1>could align themselves with them again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm going to show you something</v>

666
00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:56.510
<v Speaker 1>that's related to that.</v>

667
00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:16.880
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

668
00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:19.970
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to show you something</v>
<v Speaker 1>from Pinocchio.</v>

669
00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:22.730
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is an initiation ritual.</v>

670
00:42:23.810 --> 00:42:26.600
<v Speaker 1>It's a journey to the depths,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's journey to the underworld.</v>

671
00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:32.170
<v Speaker 1>It's the consequence of a collapse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In previous personality and the</v>

672
00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:37.670
<v Speaker 1>disintegration of that previous</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality into a chaotic state,</v>

673
00:42:37.850 --> 00:42:42.350
<v Speaker 1>prime prior to rebirth now what happens</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Pinocchio,</v>

674
00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:46.760
<v Speaker 1>which by the way was released at about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same time that World War Two was was</v>

675
00:42:46.761 --> 00:42:51.761
<v Speaker 1>brewing and which also contains one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best representations of of the of</v>

676
00:42:54.351 --> 00:42:58.160
<v Speaker 1>the individual motivations for fascism</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I've ever seen anywhere.</v>

677
00:42:58.370 --> 00:43:00.890
<v Speaker 1>That's the scenes that are associated</v>
<v Speaker 1>with pleasure island.</v>

678
00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:04.520
<v Speaker 1>Remember all the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The puppet is trying to become a real</v>

679
00:43:04.521 --> 00:43:05.121
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

680
00:43:05.121 --> 00:43:08.990
<v Speaker 1>So he's a Marionette to begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something else is pulling his strings</v>

681
00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:13.640
<v Speaker 1>well for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's your habitual state of being.</v>

682
00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:19.390
<v Speaker 1>Something else is pulling your strings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the idea that you're autonomous is</v>

683
00:43:19.401 --> 00:43:23.180
<v Speaker 1>the consequence of something else</v>
<v Speaker 1>pulling your strings and for you.</v>

684
00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:28.250
<v Speaker 1>What you needed to do was find out</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly who and what is pulling your</v>

685
00:43:28.251 --> 00:43:31.490
<v Speaker 1>strings and decide if that's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>direction in which you want to go,</v>

686
00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:34.160
<v Speaker 1>and that's really what happens to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio because we're going to watch</v>

687
00:43:34.161 --> 00:43:36.770
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio Part of it in the Pinocchio</v>
<v Speaker 1>Story.</v>

688
00:43:36.771 --> 00:43:39.890
<v Speaker 1>He starts out as a marionette.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now he's a Marionette,</v>

689
00:43:39.891 --> 00:43:42.740
<v Speaker 1>made by a good father because Japan was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good father.</v>

690
00:43:42.741 --> 00:43:46.340
<v Speaker 1>He's a good craftsman and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's a marionette with a benevolent</v>

691
00:43:46.341 --> 00:43:48.500
<v Speaker 1>puppeteer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as soon as he developed some</v>

692
00:43:48.501 --> 00:43:53.180
<v Speaker 1>autonomy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then he becomes pray to forces that are</v>

693
00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:55.940
<v Speaker 1>elements of the demonic archetype.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

694
00:43:56.300 --> 00:44:01.250
<v Speaker 1>the worst bad guy in the entire movie</v>
<v Speaker 1>turns into Satan himself at one point in</v>

695
00:44:01.251 --> 00:44:04.460
<v Speaker 1>the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically has horns in a bright red face</v>

696
00:44:04.461 --> 00:44:08.480
<v Speaker 1>and he manifests himself as so</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrifying that the coyote,</v>

697
00:44:09.250 --> 00:44:10.083
<v Speaker 1>coyote,</v>

698
00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:15.960
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] Fox and the cap that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to corrupt Pinocchio or terrified</v>

699
00:44:15.961 --> 00:44:19.440
<v Speaker 1>because they get like they're criminals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're petty criminals and deceptive</v>

700
00:44:19.590 --> 00:44:21.780
<v Speaker 1>and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when they get a look at who's</v>

701
00:44:21.781 --> 00:44:23.910
<v Speaker 1>pulling their strings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's enough to terrify them.</v>

702
00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:29.390
<v Speaker 1>And so Pinocchio goes through a series</v>
<v Speaker 1>of temptations of various sorts,</v>

703
00:44:30.031 --> 00:44:33.930
<v Speaker 1>including authority and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Freudian temptation is to remain</v>

704
00:44:33.931 --> 00:44:36.840
<v Speaker 1>weak and sickly instead of becoming a</v>
<v Speaker 1>real person.</v>

705
00:44:36.841 --> 00:44:41.280
<v Speaker 1>So it's an eternal problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And another problem that faces Pinocchio</v>

706
00:44:41.281 --> 00:44:46.281
<v Speaker 1>is that he's offered false celebrity as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a way of solving his life's problems.</v>

707
00:44:46.691 --> 00:44:49.290
<v Speaker 1>So he's offered the opportunity to</v>
<v Speaker 1>become an actor.</v>

708
00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:54.560
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is a deceitful fake</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's constructed a persona that makes</v>

709
00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:57.210
<v Speaker 1>him appear far more valuable than he</v>
<v Speaker 1>really is.</v>

710
00:44:57.211 --> 00:45:01.800
<v Speaker 1>So the movie outlines to pathological</v>
<v Speaker 1>modes of movement towards maturity,</v>

711
00:45:01.801 --> 00:45:06.600
<v Speaker 1>one being a phony and the other taking</v>
<v Speaker 1>the easy way out,</v>

712
00:45:06.601 --> 00:45:11.601
<v Speaker 1>and the and hyper are valuing all your</v>
<v Speaker 1>pathology so that you become dependent.</v>

713
00:45:14.070 --> 00:45:18.720
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then another mode of pathological</v>

714
00:45:18.721 --> 00:45:23.400
<v Speaker 1>development is offered to Pinocchio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to do nothing but engage in</v>

715
00:45:23.401 --> 00:45:26.160
<v Speaker 1>short term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>impulsive and destructive play.</v>

716
00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:29.070
<v Speaker 1>And that's on treasure island.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when he pleasure island,</v>

717
00:45:29.071 --> 00:45:33.030
<v Speaker 1>but when he goes to pleasure island,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he finds that it's actually ruled by</v>

718
00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:38.330
<v Speaker 1>demonic forces with faceless entities</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are transforming all the pleasure</v>

719
00:45:40.471 --> 00:45:45.471
<v Speaker 1>seeking marionettes to braying donkeys</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are slaves like.</v>

720
00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:54.340
<v Speaker 1>So Pinocchio escapes from that end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He does it basically by jumping into the</v>

721
00:45:54.341 --> 00:45:57.400
<v Speaker 1>unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's where we're going to start</v>

722
00:45:57.550 --> 00:46:01.330
<v Speaker 1>our exposure to his initiation.</v>

723
00:46:32.890 --> 00:46:34.840
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now you can imagine what's happened</v>

724
00:46:34.841 --> 00:46:38.440
<v Speaker 1>is he was on pleasure island and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything went to hell fundamentally.</v>

725
00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:42.040
<v Speaker 1>And so he jumped into the water to</v>
<v Speaker 1>escape from that.</v>

726
00:46:42.070 --> 00:46:44.320
<v Speaker 1>That's equivalent to plunging into</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos.</v>

727
00:46:44.321 --> 00:46:49.321
<v Speaker 1>And Chaos was an escape from</v>
<v Speaker 1>pathological tyranny and now he's trying</v>

728
00:46:49.751 --> 00:46:53.980
<v Speaker 1>to go home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is the psyche in it's searched</v>

729
00:46:53.981 --> 00:46:56.830
<v Speaker 1>for maturation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>runs into an obstacle which is the</v>

730
00:46:56.831 --> 00:47:00.930
<v Speaker 1>tyrannical element of the great father</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it cannot cope with and it trucks</v>

731
00:47:00.940 --> 00:47:04.330
<v Speaker 1>home runs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hope to defeat typical part of a hero's</v>

732
00:47:04.331 --> 00:47:06.880
<v Speaker 1>story is the initial defeat of the hero</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he</v>

733
00:47:08.410 --> 00:47:12.490
<v Speaker 1>encounters usually either the terrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>great father or the terrible great</v>

734
00:47:12.491 --> 00:47:14.620
<v Speaker 1>mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so and so.</v>

735
00:47:14.621 --> 00:47:19.621
<v Speaker 1>This is a retrogressive you'll would</v>
<v Speaker 1>call this retrogressive restoration of</v>

736
00:47:19.871 --> 00:47:23.410
<v Speaker 1>the persona,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's sort of like maybe you're a well</v>

737
00:47:23.411 --> 00:47:26.410
<v Speaker 1>adapted adolescent and you live at home</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're happy adolescent and</v>

738
00:47:26.411 --> 00:47:28.600
<v Speaker 1>everything's good at home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you go out to try to be an</v>

739
00:47:28.601 --> 00:47:31.210
<v Speaker 1>adult and you fail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then when you come back home you try</v>

740
00:47:31.211 --> 00:47:35.260
<v Speaker 1>to act like a happy adolescent again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're not what you are in fact is</v>

741
00:47:35.261 --> 00:47:36.280
<v Speaker 1>an unhappy adult.</v>

742
00:47:36.670 --> 00:47:40.150
<v Speaker 1>And if you move back to the happy</v>
<v Speaker 1>adolescent mode of being,</v>

743
00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:45.400
<v Speaker 1>then it's false and pathological.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't go home again.</v>

744
00:47:45.550 --> 00:47:49.510
<v Speaker 1>Another typical motif in literature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the cricket.</v>

745
00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:52.480
<v Speaker 1>I can't tell you everything about this</v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

746
00:47:53.110 --> 00:47:55.120
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you a couple of strange</v>
<v Speaker 1>things about it.</v>

747
00:47:55.150 --> 00:47:57.160
<v Speaker 1>One is that the cricket is Jimminy</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cricket,</v>

748
00:47:57.161 --> 00:47:58.840
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the initials of Jimminy cricket or</v>

749
00:47:58.850 --> 00:48:03.790
<v Speaker 1>RJC and Jimminy cricket was a common</v>
<v Speaker 1>Southern American</v>

750
00:48:05.470 --> 00:48:10.470
<v Speaker 1>mild form of a cursing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the equivalent of Jesus Christ.</v>

751
00:48:11.170 --> 00:48:14.790
<v Speaker 1>And so you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course the cricket is Pinocchio's</v>

752
00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:18.820
<v Speaker 1>conscience and well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then you might ask yourself why in</v>

753
00:48:18.821 --> 00:48:23.821
<v Speaker 1>the world would a pejorative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mildly pejorative term for Jesus Christ</v>

754
00:48:25.331 --> 00:48:30.331
<v Speaker 1>be applied to a cricket who's guiding a</v>
<v Speaker 1>puppet into the water to rescue his</v>

755
00:48:30.761 --> 00:48:33.610
<v Speaker 1>father from a whale?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would any of that happen?</v>

756
00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:36.250
<v Speaker 1>And answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know why,</v>

757
00:48:36.251 --> 00:48:40.210
<v Speaker 1>but you can't say why you can't say why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

758
00:48:40.570 --> 00:48:44.290
<v Speaker 1>or what it is that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the mere fact that it makes sense</v>

759
00:48:44.410 --> 00:48:48.520
<v Speaker 1>and it does is an indication from union</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective that you're operating in an</v>

760
00:48:48.521 --> 00:48:49.390
<v Speaker 1>archetipal level.</v>

761
00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:52.390
<v Speaker 1>You understand this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I could say,</v>

762
00:48:52.391 --> 00:48:54.730
<v Speaker 1>here's an example of why the cricket is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bug.</v>

763
00:48:55.540 --> 00:48:56.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things bug you,</v>

764
00:48:56.980 --> 00:48:59.260
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We say that things bug me.</v>

765
00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:02.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should do something about the things</v>

766
00:49:02.021 --> 00:49:06.400
<v Speaker 1>that bug you because that's your</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscience calling to you.</v>

767
00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:11.680
<v Speaker 1>It's it's destiny in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>manifesting itself as an unconscious</v>

768
00:49:11.681 --> 00:49:16.030
<v Speaker 1>impulse that really bugs me means if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>

769
00:49:16.031 --> 00:49:18.100
<v Speaker 1>you should do something about it because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think about it,</v>

770
00:49:18.130 --> 00:49:19.840
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of things out there that</v>

771
00:49:19.841 --> 00:49:22.300
<v Speaker 1>might bug you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but lots of them don't.</v>

772
00:49:22.330 --> 00:49:24.210
<v Speaker 1>But as some of them do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

773
00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:27.100
<v Speaker 1>why do those bug you and not other</v>
<v Speaker 1>things?</v>

774
00:49:28.030 --> 00:49:30.610
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a complicated question,</v>

775
00:49:30.611 --> 00:49:34.870
<v Speaker 1>but one potential answer to it is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's part of your psyche that's</v>

776
00:49:34.871 --> 00:49:38.680
<v Speaker 1>oriented towards further development.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Young would call that the self and</v>

777
00:49:38.681 --> 00:49:42.840
<v Speaker 1>that's like the totality of everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you could be and it's,</v>

778
00:49:42.910 --> 00:49:43.743
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

779
00:49:43.870 --> 00:49:46.180
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a strange sort of entity in some</v>

780
00:49:46.181 --> 00:49:50.170
<v Speaker 1>sense because it's partly potential and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's potential that expands across time.</v>

781
00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:55.560
<v Speaker 1>But the way that your potential totality</v>
<v Speaker 1>calls to you in the present is by</v>

782
00:49:56.410 --> 00:50:01.150
<v Speaker 1>placing things in front of you that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>your problem and they announced</v>

783
00:50:01.151 --> 00:50:04.780
<v Speaker 1>themselves as your problem and they do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that by bothering you.</v>

784
00:50:06.990 --> 00:50:11.910
<v Speaker 1>So then if you pick up the task of</v>
<v Speaker 1>fixing the things that bothers you,</v>

785
00:50:12.090 --> 00:50:16.740
<v Speaker 1>then you find the pathway to further</v>
<v Speaker 1>expansion of your personality.</v>

786
00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:19.710
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what's happening with</v>

787
00:50:19.711 --> 00:50:21.180
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that's really</v>

788
00:50:21.181 --> 00:50:24.090
<v Speaker 1>interesting about the Pinocchio movie</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that makes it incredibly</v>

789
00:50:24.091 --> 00:50:26.310
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that despite the fact that the</v>

790
00:50:26.311 --> 00:50:29.810
<v Speaker 1>cricket is a Avatar of Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

791
00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:32.780
<v Speaker 1>the cricket has things to learn just</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Pinocchio.</v>

792
00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:35.870
<v Speaker 1>And so that's very cool because it's so</v>
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>

793
00:50:35.871 --> 00:50:38.750
<v Speaker 1>It's so sophisticated because it means</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you do have a conscience that</v>

794
00:50:38.751 --> 00:50:42.230
<v Speaker 1>guides you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but until you establish a dialogue with</v>

795
00:50:42.231 --> 00:50:45.650
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both you and the conscience or immature,</v>

796
00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:50.510
<v Speaker 1>you have to establish a conscious dialog</v>
<v Speaker 1>with it and then interact together in a</v>

797
00:50:50.511 --> 00:50:52.670
<v Speaker 1>manner that propels your development</v>
<v Speaker 1>across time.</v>

798
00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:56.750
<v Speaker 1>And that'll stop you from being a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marionette of forces that would make you</v>

799
00:50:56.751 --> 00:51:00.230
<v Speaker 1>a brain donkey who does nothing but</v>
<v Speaker 1>slave away in salt mines.</v>

800
00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:03.020
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

801
00:51:03.021 --> 00:51:05.420
<v Speaker 1>so Pinocchio goes home and that doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>

802
00:51:05.421 --> 00:51:07.160
<v Speaker 1>and that's where we're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Start here.</v>

803
00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:03.960
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's happened there?</v>

804
00:52:04.470 --> 00:52:05.790
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

805
00:52:05.791 --> 00:52:09.810
<v Speaker 1>many things at multiple levels of</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality simultaneously.</v>

806
00:52:09.930 --> 00:52:12.750
<v Speaker 1>And that's the characteristic of an</v>
<v Speaker 1>archetypal story.</v>

807
00:52:13.350 --> 00:52:16.770
<v Speaker 1>So on one level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio's too old to go home,</v>

808
00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:21.300
<v Speaker 1>he can't go home to his father because</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense he's already transcended</v>

809
00:52:21.301 --> 00:52:23.340
<v Speaker 1>his father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there are things,</v>

810
00:52:23.341 --> 00:52:25.290
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that your father can't help you with.</v>

811
00:52:25.291 --> 00:52:26.880
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>

812
00:52:26.910 --> 00:52:29.670
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't know any more about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation than you do and he can't.</v>

813
00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.010
<v Speaker 1>And so that's where his knowledge limits</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

814
00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:34.530
<v Speaker 1>So that would be sort of on the personal</v>
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>

815
00:52:34.770 --> 00:52:37.550
<v Speaker 1>And then on the trends personal level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would be the deeper,</v>

816
00:52:37.740 --> 00:52:40.950
<v Speaker 1>deeper archetipal level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's happening to Pinocchio is exactly</v>

817
00:52:40.951 --> 00:52:43.140
<v Speaker 1>what needs you described at the end of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 19th century,</v>

818
00:52:43.510 --> 00:52:47.130
<v Speaker 1>because remember that Japan has his</v>
<v Speaker 1>creator and now he's dead.</v>

819
00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:50.160
<v Speaker 1>He's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so Pinocchio is bereft of,</v>

820
00:52:50.490 --> 00:52:51.323
<v Speaker 1>of</v>

821
00:52:52.370 --> 00:52:53.720
<v Speaker 1>placement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

822
00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:58.610
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his soul has been corrupted and he</v>

823
00:52:58.611 --> 00:53:02.720
<v Speaker 1>doesn't know what to do about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when he returns to his family home</v>

824
00:53:02.721 --> 00:53:06.710
<v Speaker 1>or when he returns to his tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he finds is nothing.</v>

825
00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:09.530
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then what happens?</v>

826
00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:11.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is another thing that you'll</v>

827
00:53:11.151 --> 00:53:16.040
<v Speaker 1>swallow with just no problem whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While this dove comes along that's sort</v>

828
00:53:16.041 --> 00:53:19.310
<v Speaker 1>of Goldman glowing and drops a note</v>
<v Speaker 1>right in front of him.</v>

829
00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:22.160
<v Speaker 1>Now you may remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and perhaps you don't,</v>

830
00:53:22.161 --> 00:53:27.161
<v Speaker 1>but the star from which the dove comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a representation of the blue fairy</v>

831
00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:33.630
<v Speaker 1>and the blue fairy is the positive</v>
<v Speaker 1>element of the unknown in Pinocchio</v>

832
00:53:33.630 --> 00:53:36.060
<v Speaker 1>Movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what it basically is saying that</v>

833
00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:40.830
<v Speaker 1>when you're despairing because your</v>
<v Speaker 1>father has died and your tradition has</v>

834
00:53:40.831 --> 00:53:44.400
<v Speaker 1>nothing to offer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the positive element of the unknown</v>

835
00:53:44.401 --> 00:53:47.160
<v Speaker 1>may provide you with a message about</v>
<v Speaker 1>where to go.</v>

836
00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:52.160
<v Speaker 1>If you pay enough attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be an intuition or it would</v>

837
00:53:52.171 --> 00:53:56.310
<v Speaker 1>be the automatic attraction of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>interest to a new thing by forces that</v>

838
00:53:56.311 --> 00:53:59.880
<v Speaker 1>you do not understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the real ways of coming to</v>

839
00:53:59.881 --> 00:54:04.881
<v Speaker 1>grips with the idea of the act of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious is to understand that you</v>

840
00:54:04.921 --> 00:54:06.960
<v Speaker 1>cannot control what you're interested</v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

841
00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:09.780
<v Speaker 1>And so then you might ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

842
00:54:09.781 --> 00:54:13.050
<v Speaker 1>if it's not you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>

843
00:54:14.100 --> 00:54:16.560
<v Speaker 1>And if you think about that problem long</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough,</v>

844
00:54:16.770 --> 00:54:21.270
<v Speaker 1>you'll start to understand what you was</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about because that is the way</v>

845
00:54:21.271 --> 00:54:26.160
<v Speaker 1>that you can understand in your own life</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the things that direct you as a</v>

846
00:54:26.161 --> 00:54:29.580
<v Speaker 1>being are not things that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciously choose.</v>

847
00:54:29.610 --> 00:54:31.680
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not even things that you can</v>

848
00:54:31.681 --> 00:54:35.370
<v Speaker 1>consciously choose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're directed by other forces.</v>

849
00:54:37.260 --> 00:54:40.680
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dove drops a message in front of</v>

850
00:54:40.681 --> 00:54:42.930
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the cricket.</v>

851
00:54:46.770 --> 00:54:51.750
<v Speaker 1>Now it's the cricket that reads it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's the same idea as what bugs you,</v>

852
00:54:51.870 --> 00:54:54.540
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cricket is an interpreter.</v>

853
00:55:23.380 --> 00:55:25.270
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now what have we found out?</v>

854
00:55:25.300 --> 00:55:27.820
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we found out that God,</v>

855
00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:32.680
<v Speaker 1>the father and God the father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Creator are not in fact dad,</v>

856
00:55:33.460 --> 00:55:37.150
<v Speaker 1>which is what needs should pronounced</v>
<v Speaker 1>but alive in some weird way,</v>

857
00:55:37.151 --> 00:55:39.220
<v Speaker 1>and this horrible creature at the bottom</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the ocean.</v>

858
00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:45.130
<v Speaker 1>And so what is Pinocchio decided to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He decides to go find them.</v>

859
00:55:46.870 --> 00:55:48.970
<v Speaker 1>That's actually what you're doing at</v>
<v Speaker 1>university by the way,</v>

860
00:55:50.170 --> 00:55:54.100
<v Speaker 1>for all the chaos that you experience</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you come to university and all the</v>

861
00:55:54.101 --> 00:55:58.900
<v Speaker 1>uncertainty and all the doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you're trying to do is to resurrect</v>

862
00:55:58.901 --> 00:56:01.360
<v Speaker 1>your dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>father from the bottom of the ocean,</v>

863
00:56:02.170 --> 00:56:05.980
<v Speaker 1>and if you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you won't be a Marionette and if you</v>

864
00:56:05.981 --> 00:56:07.420
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will be.</v>

865
00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:26.490
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is very interesting because the</v>

866
00:56:26.491 --> 00:56:30.180
<v Speaker 1>conscience here plays a very dichotomous</v>
<v Speaker 1>role,</v>

867
00:56:30.630 --> 00:56:33.570
<v Speaker 1>so on the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio is often ahead of his</v>

868
00:56:33.571 --> 00:56:34.980
<v Speaker 1>conscience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

869
00:56:34.981 --> 00:56:39.090
<v Speaker 1>So he's taking the leading role and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dialogue is kind of choppy and neither</v>

870
00:56:39.091 --> 00:56:42.990
<v Speaker 1>of them know exactly what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in this situation it's very</v>

871
00:56:42.991 --> 00:56:47.430
<v Speaker 1>paradoxical because you can see</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio's been half turned into bring</v>

872
00:56:47.431 --> 00:56:50.310
<v Speaker 1>Jack Ass at this point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something you might well consider when</v>

873
00:56:50.311 --> 00:56:52.680
<v Speaker 1>you remember your adolescence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

874
00:56:54.180 --> 00:56:58.740
<v Speaker 1>at this point that that the cricket,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his conscience does two things.</v>

875
00:56:58.890 --> 00:57:02.730
<v Speaker 1>It warns them how horrible this is going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be and how utterly dangerous it is.</v>

876
00:57:02.910 --> 00:57:06.390
<v Speaker 1>And then at the same time it helps them</v>
<v Speaker 1>prepare and goes along with them.</v>

877
00:57:06.391 --> 00:57:09.030
<v Speaker 1>And so it's quite comical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So watch what happens here.</v>

878
00:57:32.420 --> 00:57:33.980
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I've cut this a little bit,</v>

879
00:57:33.981 --> 00:57:37.460
<v Speaker 1>but what happens in the movie is that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes to the bottom of the ocean and he</v>

880
00:57:37.461 --> 00:57:41.450
<v Speaker 1>starts to ask about monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as soon as he asked any of the fish</v>

881
00:57:41.451 --> 00:57:45.860
<v Speaker 1>down there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the denizens of the sub oceanic world</v>

882
00:57:46.220 --> 00:57:48.980
<v Speaker 1>where monster ways they just run away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so monster,</v>

883
00:57:48.981 --> 00:57:51.980
<v Speaker 1>who is he who cannot be named,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

884
00:57:52.100 --> 00:57:54.710
<v Speaker 1>And I'm sure you've encountered that in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your reading before,</v>

885
00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:56.090
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>

886
00:57:56.420 --> 00:57:58.250
<v Speaker 1>that's the hallmark of</v>

887
00:58:00.910 --> 00:58:04.040
<v Speaker 1>in the Harry Potter series,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

888
00:58:04.041 --> 00:58:06.140
<v Speaker 1>See now you've done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

889
00:58:07.850 --> 00:58:11.360
<v Speaker 1>So this represents something so terrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it can't even be talked about.</v>

890
00:58:11.720 --> 00:58:14.150
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what happens is Pinocchio ends up not</v>

891
00:58:14.151 --> 00:58:17.900
<v Speaker 1>only at the bottom of the ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he has to go to the deepest part of</v>

892
00:58:17.901 --> 00:58:21.860
<v Speaker 1>the bottom of the ocean where the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible thing rests.</v>

893
00:58:22.580 --> 00:58:26.030
<v Speaker 1>And so we're cutting to the point where</v>
<v Speaker 1>he does that.</v>

894
00:58:58.490 --> 00:59:01.970
<v Speaker 1>So now you might ask how did Japan will</v>
<v Speaker 1>get into the whale?</v>

895
00:59:02.030 --> 00:59:04.520
<v Speaker 1>And answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's never really made that clear in the</v>

896
00:59:04.521 --> 00:59:07.700
<v Speaker 1>movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can tell you some things about</v>

897
00:59:07.701 --> 00:59:08.534
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that</v>

898
00:59:10.330 --> 00:59:11.163
<v Speaker 2>okay</v>

899
00:59:11.170 --> 00:59:16.000
<v Speaker 1>if you conceptualize your historical</v>
<v Speaker 1>tradition as a personality,</v>

900
00:59:16.180 --> 00:59:18.700
<v Speaker 1>like a body of laws and customs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say</v>

901
00:59:20.650 --> 00:59:23.750
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's dead,</v>

902
00:59:24.020 --> 00:59:26.710
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's composed of the past and</v>

903
00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:29.630
<v Speaker 1>because it's dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can't come up with anything new,</v>

904
00:59:30.290 --> 00:59:35.290
<v Speaker 1>so if it encounters something new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it it stopped and that's what's happened</v>

905
00:59:35.900 --> 00:59:40.900
<v Speaker 1>to Japan is that he's engulfed by this</v>
<v Speaker 1>entity that represents the absolute</v>

906
00:59:41.811 --> 00:59:44.360
<v Speaker 1>unknown and he cannot figure out how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get out,</v>

907
00:59:44.390 --> 00:59:47.030
<v Speaker 1>and the reason for that is none of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>things he knows,</v>

908
00:59:47.300 --> 00:59:50.750
<v Speaker 1>so none of the things that history has</v>
<v Speaker 1>produced as a body of knowledge are</v>

909
00:59:50.751 --> 00:59:53.870
<v Speaker 1>sufficient to deal with the fundamental</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

910
00:59:54.590 --> 00:59:59.590
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean they're useless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just means that just like the puppet</v>

911
01:00:00.531 --> 01:00:04.640
<v Speaker 1>is lost without the farther,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the farther is also lost without the</v>

912
01:00:04.641 --> 01:00:08.240
<v Speaker 1>puppet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the relationship between you</v>

913
01:00:08.241 --> 01:00:09.770
<v Speaker 1>and history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your history.</v>

914
01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:12.800
<v Speaker 1>When you study history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think while you're studying a record</v>

915
01:00:12.801 --> 01:00:14.840
<v Speaker 1>of events in the past and that's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

916
01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:20.240
<v Speaker 1>What you're studying is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances that gave rise to you as</v>

917
01:00:20.241 --> 01:00:21.590
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a being,</v>

918
01:00:21.950 --> 01:00:26.720
<v Speaker 1>and unless you understand your history</v>
<v Speaker 1>in every way you possibly can,</v>

919
01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:31.580
<v Speaker 1>then you're an incomplete creature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know enough to move forward</v>

920
01:00:33.530 --> 01:00:38.530
<v Speaker 1>in the same way your culture being</v>
<v Speaker 1>composed of dead father's,</v>

921
01:00:39.410 --> 01:00:42.500
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't progress without you because</v>

922
01:00:42.501 --> 01:00:47.501
<v Speaker 1>you're its eyes and there's an Egyptian</v>
<v Speaker 1>story that features the God Horus,</v>

923
01:00:47.721 --> 01:00:51.740
<v Speaker 1>who I've talked to you about before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who actually resurrect his father from</v>

924
01:00:51.741 --> 01:00:55.830
<v Speaker 1>the dad by giving him an I</v>
<v Speaker 1>so Japan,</v>

925
01:00:55.831 --> 01:00:58.340
<v Speaker 1>I can't figure out how to get out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this whale without help.</v>

926
01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:18.570
<v Speaker 1>So he's kind of pushing up tombstones</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

927
01:01:18.571 --> 01:01:19.404
<v Speaker 1>You might note,</v>

928
01:01:22.710 --> 01:01:25.050
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now something very sophisticated happens</v>

929
01:01:25.051 --> 01:01:29.520
<v Speaker 1>here so and I have to explain it to you</v>
<v Speaker 1>at multiple levels at the same time.</v>

930
01:01:29.521 --> 01:01:34.521
<v Speaker 1>So now Japan is hungry and when the</v>
<v Speaker 1>whale opens its mouth,</v>

931
01:01:37.650 --> 01:01:39.750
<v Speaker 1>a lot of fish come in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

932
01:01:39.751 --> 01:01:41.390
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I want you to think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

933
01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:43.080
<v Speaker 1>you can just put this in the back of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your mind,</v>

934
01:01:43.081 --> 01:01:47.400
<v Speaker 1>is that one of the oldest sister,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the oldest symbolic</v>

935
01:01:47.401 --> 01:01:52.320
<v Speaker 1>representations of Christ is a fish and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of his followers were fishermen,</v>

936
01:01:52.321 --> 01:01:56.910
<v Speaker 1>and so there's this weird relationship</v>
<v Speaker 1>between the messianic figure who's at</v>

937
01:01:56.911 --> 01:01:59.010
<v Speaker 1>the base of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least at the base of Christian</v>

938
01:01:59.011 --> 01:02:02.430
<v Speaker 1>culture and the idea of things that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>pulled up from the depths.</v>

939
01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:04.770
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what happens in this part of the</v>

940
01:02:04.771 --> 01:02:06.300
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so amazing.</v>

941
01:02:06.810 --> 01:02:10.830
<v Speaker 1>So Japan was looking for fish and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>reason for that is he doesn't think he</v>

942
01:02:10.831 --> 01:02:13.050
<v Speaker 1>can get out of the whale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so he might as well have some fish</v>

943
01:02:13.051 --> 01:02:16.470
<v Speaker 1>while he's while he's in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so he's given up on getting out.</v>

944
01:02:16.890 --> 01:02:20.610
<v Speaker 1>Now what happens is that the whale</v>
<v Speaker 1>swallows as if he's a fish,</v>

945
01:02:22.450 --> 01:02:26.170
<v Speaker 1>so Pinocchio was put into the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>category as fish and it happens.</v>

946
01:02:26.470 --> 01:02:30.580
<v Speaker 1>It happens to Japan a couple of times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He Mistakes Pinocchio for a fish.</v>

947
01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:33.430
<v Speaker 1>You'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what that means in some senses that</v>

948
01:02:33.431 --> 01:02:36.190
<v Speaker 1>you pedo can't distinguish between the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fish.</v>

949
01:02:36.191 --> 01:02:39.400
<v Speaker 1>That will feed you for the day and</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is that Pinocchio</v>

950
01:02:39.580 --> 01:02:41.740
<v Speaker 1>represents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you could think about Pinocchio</v>

951
01:02:41.741 --> 01:02:46.180
<v Speaker 1>as a fisherman instead of as a fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you can think about it this way.</v>

952
01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:47.140
<v Speaker 1>And here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a.</v>

953
01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:49.120
<v Speaker 1>here's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an old saying,</v>

954
01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:51.940
<v Speaker 1>if you give a man a fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feed him for one day,</v>

955
01:02:51.941 --> 01:02:54.610
<v Speaker 1>but if you teach him to fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feed him forever.</v>

956
01:02:54.820 --> 01:02:58.660
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea is it's better to</v>
<v Speaker 1>develop the skill to acquire something</v>

957
01:02:58.661 --> 01:03:00.970
<v Speaker 1>than it is to have the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

958
01:03:00.971 --> 01:03:05.710
<v Speaker 1>what Pinocchio represents is</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like a mega fish.</v>

959
01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:07.870
<v Speaker 1>I know this is a strange way of thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

960
01:03:09.070 --> 01:03:11.140
<v Speaker 1>Japan was problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't that he's hungry.</v>

961
01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:15.880
<v Speaker 1>His problem is that he can't get out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whale and so what he's fishing for</v>

962
01:03:16.390 --> 01:03:20.020
<v Speaker 1>isn't something to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something that will help them get</v>

963
01:03:20.021 --> 01:03:23.290
<v Speaker 1>out of the whale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he can't recognize the difference</v>

964
01:03:23.291 --> 01:03:27.850
<v Speaker 1>between the approximate solution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is so that he'll no longer be</v>

965
01:03:27.851 --> 01:03:29.590
<v Speaker 1>hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's got a very short term outlook</v>

966
01:03:29.770 --> 01:03:31.710
<v Speaker 1>and a solution to the much broader</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>

967
01:03:31.711 --> 01:03:35.420
<v Speaker 1>So what happens is the whale swallows a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of fish in Pinocchio's in there</v>

968
01:03:35.421 --> 01:03:40.421
<v Speaker 1>and Japan was fishing away and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>catches Pinocchio and Pinocchio</v>

969
01:03:40.450 --> 01:03:44.170
<v Speaker 1>Announces Himself and Japan says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tells them to be quiet because he's</v>

970
01:03:44.171 --> 01:03:46.990
<v Speaker 1>interfering with him fishing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when he turns to Hug Pinocchio</v>

971
01:03:47.020 --> 01:03:49.780
<v Speaker 1>because he wakes up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he actually hugs a fish and then he</v>

972
01:03:49.781 --> 01:03:53.050
<v Speaker 1>discards the fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then he figures out the Pinocchios</v>

973
01:03:53.051 --> 01:03:54.400
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then Japan,</v>

974
01:03:54.401 --> 01:03:55.110
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>decides that.</v>

975
01:03:55.110 --> 01:03:56.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to have to live inside the</v>

976
01:03:56.411 --> 01:04:00.370
<v Speaker 1>whale and it's another I idea of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>blindness at this point because he's.</v>

977
01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:02.800
<v Speaker 1>He's composed of the dead past so to</v>
<v Speaker 1>speak.</v>

978
01:04:03.130 --> 01:04:07.270
<v Speaker 1>So what Pinocchio does it start to</v>
<v Speaker 1>destroy the ship itself,</v>

979
01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:11.560
<v Speaker 1>which is what they're floating in and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whale to start a fire and the fire</v>

980
01:04:11.561 --> 01:04:13.450
<v Speaker 1>makes the whale mad enough to spit them</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

981
01:04:13.451 --> 01:04:16.570
<v Speaker 1>And the whale then transforms itself</v>
<v Speaker 1>into a dragon and tries to kill them</v>

982
01:04:16.571 --> 01:04:18.970
<v Speaker 1>because it's a fire breathing entity at</v>
<v Speaker 1>that point.</v>

983
01:04:19.210 --> 01:04:24.100
<v Speaker 1>And so part of the understory is it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>better to figure out how to fish than to</v>

984
01:04:24.101 --> 01:04:28.090
<v Speaker 1>fish or that more profoundly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's better to figure out how to do</v>

985
01:04:28.091 --> 01:04:30.910
<v Speaker 1>something than to merely benefit from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing itself.</v>

986
01:04:31.150 --> 01:04:34.540
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio represents that which can do</v>
<v Speaker 1>new things.</v>

987
01:04:34.690 --> 01:04:39.040
<v Speaker 1>So he's a hero and he's willing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>destroy part of the current order that's</v>

988
01:04:39.041 --> 01:04:44.041
<v Speaker 1>the ship in order to produce a new</v>
<v Speaker 1>strategy that will actually free them</v>

989
01:04:45.031 --> 01:04:47.070
<v Speaker 1>from the way out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now he wants to get his farther out of</v>

990
01:04:47.071 --> 01:04:49.770
<v Speaker 1>there too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what happens in the next five</v>

991
01:04:49.771 --> 01:04:50.610
<v Speaker 1>minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>

992
01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:35.820
<v Speaker 2>Come down here.</v>

993
01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:44.200
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now there's a shark here because</v>

994
01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:49.440
<v Speaker 1>essentially in some sense the entity</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going to provide the solution to</v>

995
01:08:49.751 --> 01:08:52.360
<v Speaker 1>this very complex problem has arrived on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the scene,</v>

996
01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:55.150
<v Speaker 1>but it's quite damaged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

997
01:08:55.151 --> 01:08:57.940
<v Speaker 1>it's been speaking improperly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

998
01:08:57.941 --> 01:09:02.941
<v Speaker 1>So that's an adolescent representation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it braise a lot of nonsense and it's</v>

999
01:09:03.221 --> 01:09:06.100
<v Speaker 1>been corrupted in a variety of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>

1000
01:09:06.101 --> 01:09:09.070
<v Speaker 1>to to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what that means is that as you mature</v>

1001
01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:12.910
<v Speaker 1>and you're moving away from your mere</v>
<v Speaker 1>marionette status,</v>

1002
01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:15.730
<v Speaker 1>your interaction with society like Russo</v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

1003
01:09:15.731 --> 01:09:18.520
<v Speaker 1>corrupts you in all sorts of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're participating in that</v>

1004
01:09:18.521 --> 01:09:19.870
<v Speaker 1>corruption,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it still happens.</v>

1005
01:09:20.140 --> 01:09:23.680
<v Speaker 1>But in the representation in the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth of the matter is,</v>

1006
01:09:23.681 --> 01:09:27.460
<v Speaker 1>is doesn't matter if you've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupted to some degree,</v>

1007
01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:31.540
<v Speaker 1>as long as you have an absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrificed to your capacity for true</v>

1008
01:09:31.541 --> 01:09:34.570
<v Speaker 1>speech and vision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know that's a pretty hopeful</v>

1009
01:09:35.020 --> 01:09:38.620
<v Speaker 1>message because Pinocchio is by no means</v>
<v Speaker 1>a perfect entity,</v>

1010
01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:40.240
<v Speaker 1>but he might be good enough.</v>

1011
01:10:08.740 --> 01:10:11.320
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's also an indication there of white</v>

1012
01:10:11.321 --> 01:10:16.321
<v Speaker 1>people are often unwilling to form of</v>
<v Speaker 1>representation with a so to speak form a</v>

1013
01:10:18.731 --> 01:10:22.330
<v Speaker 1>relationship with the archetype of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>great father because to some degree the</v>

1014
01:10:22.331 --> 01:10:26.380
<v Speaker 1>archetype is a figure of perfection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the individual in relationship to</v>

1015
01:10:26.381 --> 01:10:28.900
<v Speaker 1>that archetype is always pathologically</v>
<v Speaker 1>flawed.</v>

1016
01:10:29.230 --> 01:10:31.570
<v Speaker 1>And so the embarrassment of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>realization,</v>

1017
01:10:31.571 --> 01:10:33.760
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly what's happening to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio Right now,</v>

1018
01:10:33.940 --> 01:10:36.220
<v Speaker 1>is often enough to stop people from</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it.</v>

1019
01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:39.070
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what that would say to say what that</v>

1020
01:10:39.071 --> 01:10:44.071
<v Speaker 1>means in some sense is that in order for</v>
<v Speaker 1>you to mature in the fullest possible</v>

1021
01:10:44.171 --> 01:10:48.400
<v Speaker 1>manner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to understand the manner in</v>

1022
01:10:48.401 --> 01:10:50.860
<v Speaker 1>which you're deeply flawed in</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to the,</v>

1023
01:10:51.190 --> 01:10:54.040
<v Speaker 1>to your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your potential as it might be</v>

1024
01:10:54.041 --> 01:10:57.220
<v Speaker 1>historically determined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very bitter thing to do.</v>

1025
01:10:57.240 --> 01:10:58.900
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's much easier and people do this all</v>

1026
01:10:58.901 --> 01:11:02.740
<v Speaker 1>the time to engage in half witted</v>
<v Speaker 1>formulaic,</v>

1027
01:11:03.340 --> 01:11:06.250
<v Speaker 1>ideological criticisms of the system as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a whole.</v>

1028
01:11:06.251 --> 01:11:07.720
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1029
01:11:07.900 --> 01:11:12.250
<v Speaker 1>the probability that the system is more</v>
<v Speaker 1>flawed than you is pretty damn low.</v>

1030
01:11:12.550 --> 01:11:14.410
<v Speaker 1>So you want to start with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1031
01:11:14.490 --> 01:11:17.790
<v Speaker 1>getting rid of your donkey ears in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>tail and stopped bringing nonsense</v>

1032
01:11:17.791 --> 01:11:20.790
<v Speaker 1>before you judge the entire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1033
01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:25.830
<v Speaker 1>historical process by which human beings</v>
<v Speaker 1>have come into being.</v>

1034
01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:29.010
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of what that means.</v>

1035
01:11:48.180 --> 01:11:53.180
<v Speaker 2>What do you</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat</v>

1036
01:12:06.190 --> 01:12:11.190
<v Speaker 2>when you eat</v>
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>

1037
01:12:12.410 --> 01:12:13.700
<v Speaker 2>Whole Pinocchio.</v>

1038
01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:21.050
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is very interesting too because.</v>

1039
01:12:21.110 --> 01:12:24.410
<v Speaker 1>So Pinocchio ends up being a master of</v>
<v Speaker 1>fire.</v>

1040
01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:29.800
<v Speaker 1>While you can think about that as there</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a book written awhile back by a</v>

1041
01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:34.370
<v Speaker 1>primatologist who also wrote demonic</v>
<v Speaker 1>males,</v>

1042
01:12:34.490 --> 01:12:39.140
<v Speaker 1>Richard rang him and he talked about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>origin of fire and as far as Wrangham is</v>

1043
01:12:39.141 --> 01:12:41.330
<v Speaker 1>concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we invented fire about 2 million years</v>

1044
01:12:41.331 --> 01:12:46.331
<v Speaker 1>ago and that enabled us to cook food and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that enabled us to swap intestinal</v>

1045
01:12:47.301 --> 01:12:50.960
<v Speaker 1>length for brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at a chimpanzee,</v>

1046
01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:54.410
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzees are like the ultimate in</v>
<v Speaker 1>couch potatoes,</v>

1047
01:12:54.650 --> 01:12:55.311
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>

1048
01:12:55.311 --> 01:12:56.720
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're about this high and they're</v>

1049
01:12:56.721 --> 01:13:00.080
<v Speaker 1>shaped like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have this huge barrel body and the</v>

1050
01:13:00.081 --> 01:13:03.500
<v Speaker 1>reason they have that is because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat leaves and so they have to spend</v>

1051
01:13:03.501 --> 01:13:06.680
<v Speaker 1>like eight hours a day eating leaves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will eat meat if they can get it.</v>

1052
01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:09.680
<v Speaker 1>They have to spend like eight hours a</v>
<v Speaker 1>day eating leaves and just chewing them</v>

1053
01:13:09.681 --> 01:13:11.660
<v Speaker 1>over and over because like leaves a.</v>

1054
01:13:11.660 --> 01:13:14.560
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to be eating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're pretty tough than inedible</v>

1055
01:13:14.660 --> 01:13:15.840
<v Speaker 1>and B,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have any new tricks.</v>

1056
01:13:15.900 --> 01:13:17.390
<v Speaker 1>Nutritive quality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just speak up.</v>

1057
01:13:17.660 --> 01:13:20.300
<v Speaker 1>So the chimpanzee has to spend all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>its time chewing,</v>

1058
01:13:20.570 --> 01:13:23.240
<v Speaker 1>which is rather mindless endeavor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All things considered.</v>

1059
01:13:23.870 --> 01:13:26.840
<v Speaker 1>Whereas human beings 2 million years ago</v>
<v Speaker 1>or thereabouts,</v>

1060
01:13:27.110 --> 01:13:29.330
<v Speaker 1>invented fire and as a consequence of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1061
01:13:29.450 --> 01:13:34.450
<v Speaker 1>we could cook meat and meat is</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly energy rich and so and it's</v>

1062
01:13:35.301 --> 01:13:40.010
<v Speaker 1>easy to digest once it's cooked and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>the consequence of the invention of fire</v>

1063
01:13:40.011 --> 01:13:45.011
<v Speaker 1>was that were the way we are today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could have a brain instead of a gut.</v>

1064
01:13:46.220 --> 01:13:50.630
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea that Pinocchio's mastery</v>
<v Speaker 1>of fire,</v>

1065
01:13:51.170 --> 01:13:54.170
<v Speaker 1>and it's as something more than merely a</v>
<v Speaker 1>means of cooking.</v>

1066
01:13:54.171 --> 01:13:55.340
<v Speaker 1>That's how it started out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1067
01:13:55.341 --> 01:13:59.960
<v Speaker 1>But you can think of our entire</v>
<v Speaker 1>technological capacity as stemming from</v>

1068
01:13:59.961 --> 01:14:02.840
<v Speaker 1>the mastery of fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the other thing you can think of,</v>

1069
01:14:02.841 --> 01:14:07.520
<v Speaker 1>and this is very much worth considering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that Pinocchio Masters Fire and that</v>

1070
01:14:07.521 --> 01:14:09.110
<v Speaker 1>turns the whale into a dragon.</v>

1071
01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:12.100
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea there too is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is an old idea,</v>

1072
01:14:12.101 --> 01:14:17.101
<v Speaker 1>is that our technological prowess is</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that makes nature itself</v>

1073
01:14:20.260 --> 01:14:22.450
<v Speaker 1>angry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course you might say,</v>

1074
01:14:22.451 --> 01:14:23.470
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you believe this?</v>

1075
01:14:23.471 --> 01:14:24.940
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1076
01:14:24.941 --> 01:14:27.100
<v Speaker 1>how many of you have environmentalist</v>
<v Speaker 1>leanings?</v>

1077
01:14:27.101 --> 01:14:30.720
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly the story that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>following you,</v>

1078
01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:34.630
<v Speaker 1>because you're still wondering about</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether not mastery of fire was in</v>

1079
01:14:34.631 --> 01:14:38.380
<v Speaker 1>somehow against the natural order and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it will end up in all of our depths</v>

1080
01:14:38.710 --> 01:14:40.600
<v Speaker 1>and you know that's a reasonable thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>to worry about,</v>

1081
01:14:40.630 --> 01:14:45.010
<v Speaker 1>but not mastering it was going to end up</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty badly too.</v>

1082
01:14:45.190 --> 01:14:46.023
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1083
01:15:02.510 --> 01:15:05.200
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>

1084
01:17:31.090 --> 01:17:33.550
<v Speaker 1>So here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens is that in the midst of</v>

1085
01:17:33.551 --> 01:17:36.630
<v Speaker 1>this complete chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio has a choice and the choices</v>

1086
01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:39.010
<v Speaker 1>you can either save themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a very,</v>

1087
01:17:39.011 --> 01:17:44.011
<v Speaker 1>very selfish choice and reduces him to</v>
<v Speaker 1>an Aa historical individual because he</v>

1088
01:17:44.921 --> 01:17:49.921
<v Speaker 1>has no relationship left with his father</v>
<v Speaker 1>or he can put himself at great risk and</v>

1089
01:17:50.260 --> 01:17:52.290
<v Speaker 1>rescue his father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1090
01:17:52.410 --> 01:17:54.970
<v Speaker 1>finish the process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop his father from drowning and</v>

1091
01:17:55.600 --> 01:18:00.600
<v Speaker 1>complete the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1092
01:18:26.881 --> 01:18:31.881
<v Speaker 1>so</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio Dies and then his father</v>

1093
01:18:31.981 --> 01:18:36.981
<v Speaker 1>brings him home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so because he's rescued is farther,</v>

1094
01:18:52.700 --> 01:18:57.700
<v Speaker 1>the benevolent spirit of nature appears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Resurrect him and turns them into a real</v>

1095
01:19:00.540 --> 01:19:05.540
<v Speaker 1>human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's pretty funny as far as I'm</v>

1096
01:19:15.751 --> 01:19:20.160
<v Speaker 1>concerned that the answer to Nietzsche's</v>
<v Speaker 1>Greek question manifested itself in</v>

1097
01:19:20.161 --> 01:19:23.830
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mid 19 thirties in the forms of a Gnat</v>

1098
01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:27.390
<v Speaker 1>form of an animated child's movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

1099
01:19:27.391 --> 01:19:28.900
<v Speaker 1>and that's an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an example.</v>

1100
01:19:28.901 --> 01:19:32.430
<v Speaker 1>That's an example of a number of things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an example of how archetypes work.</v>

1101
01:19:32.820 --> 01:19:37.290
<v Speaker 1>It's also an example of how artists are</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the edge of discovery all the time</v>

1102
01:19:37.530 --> 01:19:39.570
<v Speaker 1>and they discover things they don't even</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>

1103
01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:42.480
<v Speaker 1>So we'll see you next Tuesday.</v>
