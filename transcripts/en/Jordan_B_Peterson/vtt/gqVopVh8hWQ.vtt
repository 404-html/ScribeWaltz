1
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.480
<v Speaker 1>I guess it starts right away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can check here.</v>

2
00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:17.763
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's life.</v>

3
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.520
<v Speaker 1>And that's that.</v>

4
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.600
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like we're ready to go.</v>

5
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.360
<v Speaker 2>So welcome everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

6
00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.260
<v Speaker 2>let's see how the q and a and goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got a number of,</v>

7
00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:39.123
<v Speaker 2>of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the questions that people have already </v>

8
00:00:40.691 --> 00:00:42.520
<v Speaker 2>submitted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'll probably start with those.</v>

9
00:00:42.521 --> 00:00:45.310
<v Speaker 2>And for those of you who are on the live</v>
<v Speaker 2>chat,</v>

10
00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.173
<v Speaker 2>you can submit questions too and I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll probably just move back and forth </v>

11
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.620
<v Speaker 2>between the ones that are pre submitted </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the ones that you guys are asking.</v>

12
00:00:53.621 --> 00:00:54.850
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and yes,</v>

13
00:00:54.851 --> 00:00:56.690
<v Speaker 2>it will be uploaded later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

14
00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.070
<v Speaker 2>I think youtube does that automatically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really good to see all of you,</v>

15
00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.490
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are people from all over the world here?</v>

16
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.170
<v Speaker 2>London and Vancouver.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And let's see,</v>

17
00:01:08.171 --> 00:01:09.460
<v Speaker 2>where else are you guys from?</v>

18
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.443
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

19
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.313
<v Speaker 2>well Toronto,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not quite as exciting since I </v>

20
00:01:14.581 --> 00:01:16.140
<v Speaker 2>live here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Quebec,</v>

21
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.980
<v Speaker 2>Calgary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Edmonton,</v>

22
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:21.623
<v Speaker 2>Vienna.</v>

23
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.960
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

24
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.130
<v Speaker 2>Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Auckland,</v>

25
00:01:24.131 --> 00:01:25.540
<v Speaker 2>New Zealand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Montreal,</v>

26
00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.940
<v Speaker 2>Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here we go.</v>

27
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.070
<v Speaker 2>Morocco,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Netherlands.</v>

28
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing that this can,</v>

29
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.620
<v Speaker 2>this can happen like that as far as I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>concerned.</v>

30
00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.550
<v Speaker 2>So it's going to take me just a bit to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get adapted to what I'm doing.</v>

31
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.190
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First question,</v>

32
00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.473
<v Speaker 2>what is your advice for finding a sane </v>
<v Speaker 2>sound therapist and do you think a </v>

33
00:01:50.561 --> 00:01:51.394
<v Speaker 2>fruitful psychotherapeutic relationship </v>
<v Speaker 2>requires a therapist to have specific </v>

34
00:01:54.401 --> 00:01:55.234
<v Speaker 2>temperamental compatibility or even </v>
<v Speaker 2>literacy and interests that align with </v>

35
00:01:58.661 --> 00:02:00.880
<v Speaker 2>the patient?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

36
00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:01.773
<v Speaker 2>I would say with regards to finding a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sane and sound therapists there some </v>

37
00:02:04.981 --> 00:02:06.880
<v Speaker 2>practical things you can do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

38
00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:08.283
<v Speaker 2>I guess this is more relevant if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>live in North America and I'm not sure </v>

39
00:02:10.601 --> 00:02:13.630
<v Speaker 2>exactly what the training requirements </v>
<v Speaker 2>are and other places in the world,</v>

40
00:02:13.631 --> 00:02:18.631
<v Speaker 2>but your best bet I would say is to find</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who's appropriately trained.</v>

41
00:02:18.941 --> 00:02:19.774
<v Speaker 2>And I would regard someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>appropriately trained as a </v>

42
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.863
<v Speaker 2>psychotherapist to be someone who's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're safer if you go with </v>

43
00:02:27.311 --> 00:02:28.144
<v Speaker 2>someone who's trained at one of the big </v>
<v Speaker 2>research schools and you have a </v>

44
00:02:30.311 --> 00:02:31.144
<v Speaker 2>therapist who's well versed in </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychotherapeutic practice but who's </v>

45
00:02:35.081 --> 00:02:35.914
<v Speaker 2>also sufficiently educated </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientifically to be able to understand </v>

46
00:02:38.951 --> 00:02:40.030
<v Speaker 2>the scientific literature.</v>

47
00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.863
<v Speaker 2>And you can be pretty certain of that if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you find a therapist who's got their </v>

48
00:02:45.851 --> 00:02:47.290
<v Speaker 2>phd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

49
00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.213
<v Speaker 2>rather than a psy d now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not that there's anything necessarily </v>

50
00:02:50.351 --> 00:02:52.390
<v Speaker 2>wrong with Saudis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they go,</v>

51
00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.243
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go received their phd from an American </v>

52
00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.460
<v Speaker 2>Psychological Association approved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

53
00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.433
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>school of clinical and those schools </v>

54
00:03:01.241 --> 00:03:03.460
<v Speaker 2>operate under what's called the bolder </v>
<v Speaker 2>model.</v>

55
00:03:03.461 --> 00:03:06.790
<v Speaker 2>And the boulder model is promotes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

56
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.010
<v Speaker 2>what now what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's it called,</v>

57
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.040
<v Speaker 2>science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>science practitioner as,</v>

58
00:03:12.041 --> 00:03:16.660
<v Speaker 2>as the optimal ideal combination for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychotherapist.</v>

59
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.580
<v Speaker 2>So someone who's trained </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychotherapeutic,</v>

60
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:19.653
<v Speaker 2>but also has research experience and can</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand the relevant scientific </v>

61
00:03:23.321 --> 00:03:26.650
<v Speaker 2>literature as it pertains to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to mental health.</v>

62
00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.850
<v Speaker 2>So that would be the first thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The second thing I would say is,</v>

63
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.170
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I go to see yours,</v>

64
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:34.103
<v Speaker 2>a psychotherapist once and maybe go to </v>
<v Speaker 2>see a couple of them and find someone </v>

65
00:03:37.601 --> 00:03:42.310
<v Speaker 2>that listens to you because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychotherapist shouldn't be someone who</v>

66
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.810
<v Speaker 2>solves your problems for you or offers </v>
<v Speaker 2>even really offers you advice.</v>

67
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:47.643
<v Speaker 2>Although sometimes that can be helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really what the psychotherapists should </v>

68
00:03:50.981 --> 00:03:51.814
<v Speaker 2>do is be someone who can help you </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand what problem it is that </v>

69
00:03:54.941 --> 00:03:55.774
<v Speaker 2>you're facing so that that can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>delineated properly to help you </v>

70
00:03:59.171 --> 00:04:00.004
<v Speaker 2>articulate what it is that you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what your vision of mental health </v>

71
00:04:02.471 --> 00:04:05.590
<v Speaker 2>might be and what you'd like to attain </v>
<v Speaker 2>in psychotherapy,</v>

72
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.860
<v Speaker 2>and then who helps you strategize </v>
<v Speaker 2>towards that end.</v>

73
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.113
<v Speaker 2>And so you want someone who will really </v>
<v Speaker 2>listen to you that you feel comfortable </v>

74
00:04:13.751 --> 00:04:14.584
<v Speaker 2>telling the truth too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's also incredibly </v>

75
00:04:17.441 --> 00:04:18.640
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to,</v>

76
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:20.970
<v Speaker 2>you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

77
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.820
<v Speaker 2>if you can't tell your psychotherapist </v>
<v Speaker 2>the truth,</v>

78
00:04:24.821 --> 00:04:25.654
<v Speaker 2>then you're not going to get anywhere in</v>
<v Speaker 2>therapy because you won't be able to </v>

79
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:30.970
<v Speaker 2>actually outline the nature of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental problems.</v>

80
00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:32.373
<v Speaker 2>So that's vital and go see someone and </v>
<v Speaker 2>see if you're happy with the way that </v>

81
00:04:38.021 --> 00:04:40.600
<v Speaker 2>you're interacting with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the most relevant issue.</v>

82
00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.980
<v Speaker 2>So</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the first question.</v>

83
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.983
<v Speaker 2>Now the next one was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do I think s fruitful psychotherapeutic </v>

84
00:04:49.511 --> 00:04:50.344
<v Speaker 2>relationship requires the therapist to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have specific temperamental </v>

85
00:04:52.481 --> 00:04:56.290
<v Speaker 2>compatibility or even literacy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>interests that align with the patient?</v>

86
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.400
<v Speaker 2>I think that</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

87
00:05:02.401 --> 00:05:03.234
<v Speaker 2>I think it's difficult to work with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>therapist who is less intelligent than </v>

88
00:05:06.031 --> 00:05:06.864
<v Speaker 2>you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of a rough way of </v>

89
00:05:09.421 --> 00:05:10.254
<v Speaker 2>conceptualizing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But a lot of what a therapist does is </v>

90
00:05:12.391 --> 00:05:13.224
<v Speaker 2>help you strategize and the person has </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be able to think analytically and </v>

91
00:05:15.721 --> 00:05:16.554
<v Speaker 2>probably at least to some degree to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same with the same degree of complexity </v>

92
00:05:20.671 --> 00:05:22.550
<v Speaker 2>that you're capable of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

93
00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.440
<v Speaker 2>it's not necessarily a good idea to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to out think your,</v>

94
00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.750
<v Speaker 2>your therapist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

95
00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.710
<v Speaker 2>Dr. Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard you recently say that if a woman</v>

96
00:05:40.711 --> 00:05:44.700
<v Speaker 2>doesn't want a baby by age 30 that </v>
<v Speaker 2>something is unhealthy.</v>

97
00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:49.260
<v Speaker 2>I take no offense to that assertion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rather I am taking it very seriously.</v>

98
00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:51.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm 34 years old in a longterm </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship,</v>

99
00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:55.590
<v Speaker 2>but don't feel desire to have children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always thought that I would one day,</v>

100
00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:56.543
<v Speaker 2>but I'm getting older and that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting older and that day still hasn't </v>

101
00:05:58.971 --> 00:06:01.130
<v Speaker 2>come.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm terrified of reasoning,</v>

102
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.380
<v Speaker 2>realizing too late that I should have </v>
<v Speaker 2>had a family.</v>

103
00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.340
<v Speaker 2>But I'm also terrified of having them </v>
<v Speaker 2>and regretting it because it never truly</v>

104
00:06:07.341 --> 00:06:08.174
<v Speaker 2>want it to be a mother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I have any ideology at </v>

105
00:06:10.341 --> 00:06:11.174
<v Speaker 2>play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a feminist or anything like </v>

106
00:06:12.531 --> 00:06:14.720
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you say something might be wrong or</v>

107
00:06:14.721 --> 00:06:16.220
<v Speaker 2>unhealthy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where might I look?</v>

108
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.910
<v Speaker 2>Any advice on how to make this change </v>
<v Speaker 2>but won't make this choice?</v>

109
00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.920
<v Speaker 2>P S my boyfriend and I both had he </v>
<v Speaker 2>depaul mothers perhaps that is relevant.</v>

110
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:30.130
<v Speaker 2>Well it might be relevant given that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>saw fit to um,</v>

111
00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:31.343
<v Speaker 2>included as a potential detail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the rules that I would </v>

112
00:06:33.981 --> 00:06:34.814
<v Speaker 2>operate by as a psychotherapist is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>if a client is inclined to add a detail </v>

113
00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:40.483
<v Speaker 2>to the</v>

114
00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:41.920
<v Speaker 1>okay</v>

115
00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:42.753
<v Speaker 2>to the formulation of a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the details are likely to be </v>

116
00:06:45.401 --> 00:06:46.970
<v Speaker 2>relevant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

117
00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:50.360
<v Speaker 2>but I can't tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

118
00:06:50.361 --> 00:06:53.260
<v Speaker 2>Because of course I can't use it a rule </v>
<v Speaker 2>of thumb.</v>

119
00:06:53.261 --> 00:06:54.650
<v Speaker 2>And so you might object,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

120
00:06:54.651 --> 00:06:55.484
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't have used a rule of thumb to</v>
<v Speaker 2>say something like if a woman doesn't </v>

121
00:06:58.161 --> 00:07:00.800
<v Speaker 2>want a baby by the age of 30,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that something is unhealthy.</v>

122
00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:01.963
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are going to be exceptions to every </v>

123
00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:04.423
<v Speaker 2>general rule.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But my attitude to this essentially is </v>

124
00:07:08.271 --> 00:07:09.104
<v Speaker 2>that we have all come from an unbroken </v>
<v Speaker 2>string of 3.5 million years of </v>

125
00:07:14.061 --> 00:07:17.780
<v Speaker 2>successful mothers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the probability that that's going</v>

126
00:07:17.781 --> 00:07:22.781
<v Speaker 2>to be part and parcel of the healthy </v>
<v Speaker 2>woman's desire and not only a woman,</v>

127
00:07:24.471 --> 00:07:25.304
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously men desire to have a family </v>

128
00:07:26.361 --> 00:07:28.280
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and often very intensely.</v>

129
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:29.383
<v Speaker 2>It's just that men have a much longer </v>
<v Speaker 2>time span over which to consider such </v>

130
00:07:32.811 --> 00:07:33.644
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So perhaps the chips aren't down so </v>

131
00:07:36.921 --> 00:07:40.150
<v Speaker 2>rapidly and to the same degree for men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

132
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:45.550
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't be so bold as to say that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's anything wrong with you,</v>

133
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:48.110
<v Speaker 2>the questionnaire specifically.</v>

134
00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:49.473
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you have the sort of temperament </v>

135
00:07:50.781 --> 00:07:53.480
<v Speaker 2>that isn't particularly inclined towards</v>
<v Speaker 2>maternal behavior.</v>

136
00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:54.453
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that might be someone who's low in </v>

137
00:07:55.401 --> 00:07:59.000
<v Speaker 2>agreeableness and well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be the primary issue.</v>

138
00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:03.230
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so I wouldn't take my word for it,</v>

139
00:08:03.231 --> 00:08:04.064
<v Speaker 2>that if you don't want to have a child </v>
<v Speaker 2>in your 30 that there is necessarily </v>

140
00:08:07.041 --> 00:08:10.310
<v Speaker 2>something specifically wrong with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I would say as a rule of thumb,</v>

141
00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:15.560
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's part of the normal panoply of human</v>

142
00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:18.590
<v Speaker 2>desires and values.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if,</v>

143
00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.860
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there's violent objection to having a</v>

144
00:08:21.861 --> 00:08:22.694
<v Speaker 2>family or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then generally that seems to me to be </v>

145
00:08:25.581 --> 00:08:29.000
<v Speaker 2>indicative of something that might be at</v>
<v Speaker 2>least worth looking into.</v>

146
00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:41.170
<v Speaker 2>I'll try a live one here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a live question.</v>

147
00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:42.700
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

148
00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:43.533
<v Speaker 2>What do I think of Paul Joseph Watson </v>
<v Speaker 2>position that populism is the new punk </v>

149
00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.120
<v Speaker 2>slash counterculture?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

150
00:08:49.121 --> 00:08:49.954
<v Speaker 2>that's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually happened to watch that video </v>

151
00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:57.030
<v Speaker 2>a couple of days ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question.</v>

152
00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:58.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see that,</v>

153
00:08:58.410 --> 00:08:59.243
<v Speaker 2>you see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say some indication of that on </v>

154
00:09:00.421 --> 00:09:01.254
<v Speaker 2>Youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although it's not easy to get an </v>

155
00:09:02.911 --> 00:09:03.744
<v Speaker 2>unbiased sample of what's going on on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Youtube because of course youtube tends </v>

156
00:09:07.951 --> 00:09:08.784
<v Speaker 2>to present you with things that are akin</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the things that you're already </v>

157
00:09:11.881 --> 00:09:12.714
<v Speaker 2>watching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does appear to me that the </v>

158
00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.133
<v Speaker 2>conservative commentators on youtube are</v>
<v Speaker 2>playing somewhat of the same role that </v>

159
00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:25.920
<v Speaker 2>the counter culture played,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's call it more traditionally.</v>

160
00:09:25.921 --> 00:09:28.350
<v Speaker 2>Even though that's a funny thing to say </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the counterculture.</v>

161
00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.010
<v Speaker 2>What I'm wondering more is whether or </v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

162
00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.830
<v Speaker 2>not so much whether it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>counterculture,</v>

163
00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:34.673
<v Speaker 2>but if it's something that's more </v>
<v Speaker 2>specifically associated with a place </v>

164
00:09:37.201 --> 00:09:38.034
<v Speaker 2>that men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>young men are finding their new </v>

165
00:09:39.571 --> 00:09:41.400
<v Speaker 2>political voice online.</v>

166
00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:42.913
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the reason that I'm wondering </v>

167
00:09:44.551 --> 00:09:45.384
<v Speaker 2>about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although there are a number of female </v>

168
00:09:46.561 --> 00:09:51.180
<v Speaker 2>conservative commentators who also </v>
<v Speaker 2>become popular online is because many of</v>

169
00:09:51.181 --> 00:09:52.014
<v Speaker 2>the commentators appear to be man and </v>
<v Speaker 2>many of the people who are following </v>

170
00:09:54.811 --> 00:09:57.600
<v Speaker 2>them also appear to be men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

171
00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:01.680
<v Speaker 2>and it's not obvious to me that men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's easy now for men,</v>

172
00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:06.630
<v Speaker 2>especially young men to have a political</v>
<v Speaker 2>voice on campus for example,</v>

173
00:10:06.631 --> 00:10:09.040
<v Speaker 2>or perhaps even in public.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

174
00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:11.910
<v Speaker 2>and so maybe they're turning to youtube </v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

175
00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:17.450
<v Speaker 2>to find these viewpoints that aren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>being district disseminated is widely in</v>

176
00:10:19.381 --> 00:10:21.540
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the popular media.</v>

177
00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:23.183
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

178
00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:29.270
<v Speaker 2>was there ever a time when you saw a </v>
<v Speaker 2>therapist of some kind?</v>

179
00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:30.260
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

180
00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.410
<v Speaker 2>actually I haven't ever seen a therapist</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

181
00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:36.080
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that might seem strange.</v>

182
00:10:36.081 --> 00:10:38.270
<v Speaker 2>I suppose given that I am a </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologist,</v>

183
00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:39.663
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really like talking about my </v>

184
00:10:40.581 --> 00:10:42.950
<v Speaker 2>problems with other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As it turns out,</v>

185
00:10:42.951 --> 00:10:46.100
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather keep them to myself and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

186
00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:50.030
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would say having said that is that</v>

187
00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:51.163
<v Speaker 2>I've read an awful lot of the writings </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the great clinical psychologists and </v>

188
00:10:55.251 --> 00:11:00.251
<v Speaker 2>psychiatrists and I would say that I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>used them as psychotherapeutic aids.</v>

189
00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:02.820
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that plays,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

190
00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very similar role that can play a very</v>

191
00:11:06.021 --> 00:11:08.030
<v Speaker 2>similar role.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

192
00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:37.090
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just had to update the link.</v>

193
00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:38.123
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

194
00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:40.960
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's try another question here from,</v>

195
00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:41.853
<v Speaker 2>from the prepared questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried to rank order these by the </v>

196
00:11:43.671 --> 00:11:44.750
<v Speaker 2>number of people that</v>

197
00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:46.773
<v Speaker 1>mmm.</v>

198
00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:49.020
<v Speaker 2>Indicated an interest in them.</v>

199
00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:50.583
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

200
00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:12.383
<v Speaker 2>you emphasize the spoken truth and </v>
<v Speaker 2>negotiation as the alternative to war </v>

201
00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:18.323
<v Speaker 2>and site Solzhenitsyn as a brilliant </v>
<v Speaker 2>documenter of the potential or </v>

202
00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:22.403
<v Speaker 2>inevitable fallout of deceit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in soldiers nip since diagnosis of </v>

203
00:12:28.111 --> 00:12:30.300
<v Speaker 2>the factors leading to the Gulag </v>
<v Speaker 2>archipelago,</v>

204
00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:31.673
<v Speaker 2>he also included the failure of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>to take a violent stand to disrupt </v>

205
00:12:34.471 --> 00:12:36.480
<v Speaker 2>tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And here's a quote</v>

206
00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:41.760
<v Speaker 2>and how will we burned in the camps </v>
<v Speaker 2>later thinking,</v>

207
00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:43.523
<v Speaker 2>what would things would be like if every</v>
<v Speaker 2>security operative when he went out at </v>

208
00:12:46.561 --> 00:12:47.394
<v Speaker 2>night to make an arrest?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Had been uncertain whether he would </v>

209
00:12:49.261 --> 00:12:50.094
<v Speaker 2>return alive and had to say goodbye to </v>
<v Speaker 2>his family or if during periods of mass </v>

210
00:12:54.451 --> 00:12:56.370
<v Speaker 2>arrests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as for example,</v>

211
00:12:56.371 --> 00:12:59.910
<v Speaker 2>in Leningrad when they arrested a </v>
<v Speaker 2>quarter of the entire city,</v>

212
00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:01.613
<v Speaker 2>people had not simply sat there in their</v>
<v Speaker 2>layers paling with terror at every bang </v>

213
00:13:04.711 --> 00:13:07.440
<v Speaker 2>of the downstairs door and every step on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the staircase,</v>

214
00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:08.453
<v Speaker 2>but at understood they had nothing left </v>
<v Speaker 2>to lose and then boldly set up in the </v>

215
00:13:10.711 --> 00:13:14.120
<v Speaker 2>downstairs hall and ambush of half a </v>
<v Speaker 2>dozen people with axes,</v>

216
00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:15.240
<v Speaker 2>hammers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pokers,</v>

217
00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:16.313
<v Speaker 2>or whatever else was at hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The organs would very quickly have </v>

218
00:13:19.141 --> 00:13:19.974
<v Speaker 2>suffered a shortage of officers and </v>
<v Speaker 2>transport and notwithstanding all of </v>

219
00:13:22.681 --> 00:13:25.350
<v Speaker 2>Stalins thirst,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cursive machine would have ground to</v>

220
00:13:25.351 --> 00:13:26.184
<v Speaker 2>a halt if if we didn't love freedom </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough and even the more we had no real </v>

221
00:13:32.521 --> 00:13:35.880
<v Speaker 2>awareness of the situation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we purely and simply deserved everything</v>

222
00:13:35.881 --> 00:13:37.080
<v Speaker 2>that happened afterwards.</v>

223
00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:39.013
<v Speaker 2>End of quote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there appears to be a point where the </v>

224
00:13:41.251 --> 00:13:42.084
<v Speaker 2>price of our sovereignty and liberty </v>
<v Speaker 2>must be paid with blood in addition to </v>

225
00:13:44.761 --> 00:13:46.980
<v Speaker 2>the vulnerability required by the spoken</v>
<v Speaker 2>truth.</v>

226
00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:48.293
<v Speaker 2>Here are my questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you agree that there is such a point </v>

227
00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:54.220
<v Speaker 2>or to the weapons in power we possess </v>
<v Speaker 2>today make violence in,</v>

228
00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:56.430
<v Speaker 2>in viable course of action?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

229
00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:57.293
<v Speaker 2>well I would say first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of what soldier nicheness talking </v>

230
00:14:00.841 --> 00:14:01.674
<v Speaker 2>about actually is the right to self </v>
<v Speaker 2>defense and you have the right to self </v>

231
00:14:04.381 --> 00:14:05.214
<v Speaker 2>defense and you have the right to use </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever force is necessary and </v>

232
00:14:08.431 --> 00:14:11.040
<v Speaker 2>reasonable when you're defending </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself and you know,</v>

233
00:14:11.041 --> 00:14:13.920
<v Speaker 2>in under the American constitution for </v>
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>

234
00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:17.040
<v Speaker 2>it's predicated on the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least in part,</v>

235
00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:18.353
<v Speaker 2>that you have not only the right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but perhaps the moral obligation to </v>

236
00:14:21.211 --> 00:14:25.410
<v Speaker 2>resist tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so obviously,</v>

237
00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:27.090
<v Speaker 2>so that that's a difference.</v>

238
00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:27.953
<v Speaker 2>That's very different from using </v>
<v Speaker 2>violence for specifically political </v>

239
00:14:30.991 --> 00:14:32.820
<v Speaker 2>ends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's art.</v>

240
00:14:32.821 --> 00:14:36.330
<v Speaker 2>Do you have the right to defend yourself</v>
<v Speaker 2>against incursions into your own home or</v>

241
00:14:36.331 --> 00:14:39.960
<v Speaker 2>into your own family?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think the answer to that is you do</v>

242
00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:44.430
<v Speaker 2>part of the reason that it has </v>
<v Speaker 2>manifested itself,</v>

243
00:14:44.431 --> 00:14:47.160
<v Speaker 2>so that being dangerous is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>appropriate response.</v>

244
00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:48.593
<v Speaker 2>Now then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well how do you know how to calibrate </v>

245
00:14:51.831 --> 00:14:54.020
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your defensive response?</v>

246
00:14:54.021 --> 00:14:54.801
<v Speaker 2>And I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

247
00:14:54.801 --> 00:14:57.800
<v Speaker 2>we have some legal guidelines for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

248
00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:01.820
<v Speaker 2>that would be the guidelines governing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>governing self defense in general.</v>

249
00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:07.720
<v Speaker 2>I guess maybe it's time for a more </v>
<v Speaker 2>aggressive response when you're prepared</v>

250
00:15:08.181 --> 00:15:10.550
<v Speaker 2>to pay the price for that or aggressive </v>
<v Speaker 2>response.</v>

251
00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:11.403
<v Speaker 2>Do you have to think it through?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you certainly have the right to </v>

252
00:15:13.491 --> 00:15:14.324
<v Speaker 2>protect yourself and your family and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and your property from inappropriate </v>

253
00:15:19.161 --> 00:15:22.040
<v Speaker 2>incursion by other individuals or by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>state.</v>

254
00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:26.030
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and without knowing the specifics of any</v>

255
00:15:26.031 --> 00:15:28.790
<v Speaker 2>given circumstance that might call for </v>
<v Speaker 2>such a response.</v>

256
00:15:28.791 --> 00:15:32.030
<v Speaker 2>It's difficult to be any more straight </v>
<v Speaker 2>forward about that.</v>

257
00:15:32.031 --> 00:15:32.864
<v Speaker 2>But I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm certainly wouldn't regard myself </v>

258
00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:38.210
<v Speaker 2>precisely as a pacifist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

259
00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:40.580
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I believe that there are,</v>

260
00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:43.760
<v Speaker 2>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's reasonable to meet</v>

261
00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:48.173
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how would I say you have the right to </v>

262
00:15:50.431 --> 00:15:53.550
<v Speaker 2>self defense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's as clearly as I can formulate it.</v>

263
00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:56.240
<v Speaker 2>Can I ask your thoughts on Brexit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

264
00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:57.153
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a question coming from the live </v>

265
00:15:58.321 --> 00:15:58.921
<v Speaker 2>chat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

266
00:15:58.921 --> 00:16:00.570
<v Speaker 2>You can have my thoughts on brexit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tom.</v>

267
00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:03.480
<v Speaker 2>The other day I was doing a lecture on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

268
00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:07.260
<v Speaker 2>on the stories in genesis and one of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>stories that I analyze briefly,</v>

269
00:16:07.261 --> 00:16:11.580
<v Speaker 2>and this will be posted very soon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the story of the Tower of Babel.</v>

270
00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:14.100
<v Speaker 2>And I've been very curious about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>

271
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:17.760
<v Speaker 2>It comes after Noah's flood myth in </v>
<v Speaker 2>genesis and</v>

272
00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:20.503
<v Speaker 2>it's very interesting story in what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens is that human beings get </v>

273
00:16:24.381 --> 00:16:25.214
<v Speaker 2>together and they decide to build a </v>
<v Speaker 2>massive building and the human beings </v>

274
00:16:30.321 --> 00:16:31.154
<v Speaker 2>that are building that building all </v>
<v Speaker 2>speak in one voice and they have this </v>

275
00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:35.683
<v Speaker 2>grand vision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you might regard as a utopian </v>

276
00:16:37.551 --> 00:16:39.380
<v Speaker 2>vision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what I think it is,</v>

277
00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:40.543
<v Speaker 2>that they can build a building so high </v>
<v Speaker 2>that within it everyone will speak the </v>

278
00:16:44.481 --> 00:16:46.820
<v Speaker 2>same language and it will reach all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way to have it.</v>

279
00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:51.800
<v Speaker 2>And so you could see it in some sense as</v>
<v Speaker 2>an attempt to usurp the transcendent.</v>

280
00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:54.110
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of read it as an EA,</v>

281
00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:56.960
<v Speaker 2>an early precursor of the story that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Milton told him,</v>

282
00:16:56.961 --> 00:16:58.580
<v Speaker 2>paradise lost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where Satan,</v>

283
00:16:58.581 --> 00:17:01.250
<v Speaker 2>who's God's highest avidly angel and </v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps,</v>

284
00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:02.383
<v Speaker 2>and who's Lucifer?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That the brightest light in the psychic </v>

285
00:17:06.501 --> 00:17:07.990
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy you might say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

286
00:17:07.991 --> 00:17:12.530
<v Speaker 2>and the spirit of untrammeled </v>
<v Speaker 2>rationality decides that he can wage war</v>

287
00:17:12.531 --> 00:17:13.364
<v Speaker 2>in heaven and overcome God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>overcome the ultimate in the </v>

288
00:17:16.371 --> 00:17:17.330
<v Speaker 2>transcendent value.</v>

289
00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:18.163
<v Speaker 2>When I read that as a cautionary tale </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the pride that goes along with </v>

290
00:17:22.851 --> 00:17:23.684
<v Speaker 2>intellectual presupposition in the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>pride that produced the totalitarian </v>

291
00:17:26.451 --> 00:17:27.284
<v Speaker 2>states of the 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens with the Tower of Babel is </v>

292
00:17:29.961 --> 00:17:30.794
<v Speaker 2>that human beings start to build this a </v>
<v Speaker 2>unitary homogenous structure who's </v>

293
00:17:36.531 --> 00:17:37.364
<v Speaker 2>pentacle will reach into God's heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He domain perhaps thereby taking the </v>

294
00:17:42.111 --> 00:17:42.944
<v Speaker 2>place of the transcendent God gets wind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of that and goes to earth and takes the </v>

295
00:17:47.901 --> 00:17:50.790
<v Speaker 2>people or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or transforms the people who are,</v>

296
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.410
<v Speaker 2>who are building the building and who in</v>
<v Speaker 2>principle it would house into a polyglot</v>

297
00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:56.273
<v Speaker 2>of people speaking different languages </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then scatters them all over the </v>

298
00:17:58.861 --> 00:18:00.420
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

299
00:18:00.421 --> 00:18:01.254
<v Speaker 2>what I think that means is that if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>try to build a homogenous totalitarian </v>

300
00:18:06.871 --> 00:18:09.570
<v Speaker 2>structure that you searched the </v>
<v Speaker 2>transcendent,</v>

301
00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:12.660
<v Speaker 2>it will begin to badly fragment from </v>
<v Speaker 2>within.</v>

302
00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:15.540
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's a warning against </v>
<v Speaker 2>gigantism.</v>

303
00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:19.380
<v Speaker 2>And I think one of the things that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening in Europe is that we're seeing</v>

304
00:18:19.381 --> 00:18:22.410
<v Speaker 2>the folly of the idea of too big to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fail.</v>

305
00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:23.603
<v Speaker 2>What we're seeing instead is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>manifestation of so big it will </v>

306
00:18:27.271 --> 00:18:28.104
<v Speaker 2>certainly fail and I think the reason </v>
<v Speaker 2>for that is that there has to be a </v>

307
00:18:31.771 --> 00:18:32.604
<v Speaker 2>certain degree of homogeneity within </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything that can be categorized as an </v>

308
00:18:36.001 --> 00:18:36.834
<v Speaker 2>organization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the degree of heterogeneity within </v>

309
00:18:39.721 --> 00:18:44.721
<v Speaker 2>the organization becomes too extreme and</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the organization becomes too large,</v>

310
00:18:45.061 --> 00:18:48.030
<v Speaker 2>then it's very difficult for people to </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel any affinity with it.</v>

311
00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:49.223
<v Speaker 2>They're going to fragment back into </v>
<v Speaker 2>their subsidiary identity groups and </v>

312
00:18:52.591 --> 00:18:54.360
<v Speaker 2>those might be national groups for </v>
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>

313
00:18:54.361 --> 00:18:55.194
<v Speaker 2>which seems to be what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's happening in Europe and then the </v>

314
00:18:57.331 --> 00:18:58.164
<v Speaker 2>whole thing is going to fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I have some sympathy for that </v>

315
00:19:00.541 --> 00:19:01.374
<v Speaker 2>because I think that it's necessary for </v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings at an individual level to </v>

316
00:19:05.131 --> 00:19:08.700
<v Speaker 2>feel some sort of affinity for the power</v>
<v Speaker 2>structures that they find themselves in.</v>

317
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:09.833
<v Speaker 2>And maybe being one 300 Mil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one 300000000th of an entity is to be </v>

318
00:19:15.121 --> 00:19:19.410
<v Speaker 2>too much of a non entity to feel any </v>
<v Speaker 2>real affinity for that structure.</v>

319
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:23.280
<v Speaker 2>So that's part of what I think's </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening with regards to brexit.</v>

320
00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:28.010
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

321
00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:30.860
<v Speaker 2>so let's see what happens here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A little another.</v>

322
00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:32.780
<v Speaker 2>Let's take another live question here</v>

323
00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:38.860
<v Speaker 2>is remove the toxic people in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wholly.</v>

324
00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:40.630
<v Speaker 2>Good advice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

325
00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:41.523
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say it's wholly good advice </v>

326
00:19:42.761 --> 00:19:46.090
<v Speaker 2>because no single piece of advice could </v>
<v Speaker 2>be considered as holy good,</v>

327
00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:47.073
<v Speaker 2>except perhaps for tell the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that one might be outside that </v>

328
00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:55.980
<v Speaker 2>that rule of thumb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it depends very much on what you mean by</v>

329
00:19:56.411 --> 00:20:01.390
<v Speaker 2>toxic and also who's doing the judgment </v>
<v Speaker 2>with regards to toxicity.</v>

330
00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:02.793
<v Speaker 2>My sense is that you should surround </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself with people who genuinely want </v>

331
00:20:09.611 --> 00:20:12.610
<v Speaker 2>the best for you or perhaps more </v>
<v Speaker 2>specifically,</v>

332
00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:16.240
<v Speaker 2>genuinely want the best for the best </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of you.</v>

333
00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:17.853
<v Speaker 2>And if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the people around you are not </v>

334
00:20:19.991 --> 00:20:20.824
<v Speaker 2>supporting you in your endeavors and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they put you down and they punish you </v>

335
00:20:23.321 --> 00:20:24.154
<v Speaker 2>for your virtues or even punish you too </v>
<v Speaker 2>intensely for your faults and failed to </v>

336
00:20:28.061 --> 00:20:28.894
<v Speaker 2>reward you when you're doing what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>should be doing and fail to engage in </v>

337
00:20:32.441 --> 00:20:35.800
<v Speaker 2>reciprocal interactions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there comes a point where you would</v>

338
00:20:35.801 --> 00:20:38.890
<v Speaker 2>be better off finding someone who is </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually on your side.</v>

339
00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:41.440
<v Speaker 2>And that can even be the case with </v>
<v Speaker 2>family members.</v>

340
00:20:41.441 --> 00:20:43.990
<v Speaker 2>Although of course that's a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult decision to make.</v>

341
00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:45.183
<v Speaker 2>But sometimes people do have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>misfortune of being up with family </v>

342
00:20:48.011 --> 00:20:48.844
<v Speaker 2>members who are so who are operating in </v>
<v Speaker 2>a manner that's so counterproductive to </v>

343
00:20:52.661 --> 00:20:53.494
<v Speaker 2>their health that it's better for them </v>
<v Speaker 2>despite the pain to cease communication </v>

344
00:20:57.341 --> 00:20:58.640
<v Speaker 2>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

345
00:20:58.690 --> 00:20:59.523
<v Speaker 2>and sometimes paradoxically enough that </v>
<v Speaker 2>can also facilitate communication </v>

346
00:21:03.341 --> 00:21:04.174
<v Speaker 2>because sometimes you have to draw a </v>
<v Speaker 2>line in the sand before people are </v>

347
00:21:06.191 --> 00:21:07.024
<v Speaker 2>willing to undergo the serious self </v>
<v Speaker 2>consideration that print would proceed </v>

348
00:21:11.261 --> 00:21:14.140
<v Speaker 2>any real transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

349
00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:15.393
<v Speaker 2>but I would say even if even if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't like the idea of removing the </v>

350
00:21:19.811 --> 00:21:20.644
<v Speaker 2>toxic people in your life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should certainly endeavor to </v>

351
00:21:23.261 --> 00:21:24.094
<v Speaker 2>surround yourself with the sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that you would want to surround </v>

352
00:21:26.951 --> 00:21:29.800
<v Speaker 2>someone that you regarded as your friend</v>
<v Speaker 2>or loved one.</v>

353
00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:31.113
<v Speaker 2>So you need to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to extend the same courtesy to </v>

354
00:21:35.111 --> 00:21:35.944
<v Speaker 2>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially to the part of yourself that </v>

355
00:21:37.371 --> 00:21:39.850
<v Speaker 2>striving upward that you would to </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone that you cared for.</v>

356
00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:41.163
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

357
00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:48.283
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do I think of the phrase diversity </v>

358
00:21:52.941 --> 00:21:54.980
<v Speaker 2>is our strength?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

359
00:21:54.981 --> 00:21:55.814
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a slogan and the word </v>
<v Speaker 2>slogan is derived from the Welsh two </v>

360
00:22:00.741 --> 00:22:02.600
<v Speaker 2>words slew ag,</v>
<v Speaker 2>s,</v>

361
00:22:02.601 --> 00:22:03.340
<v Speaker 2>l,</v>
<v Speaker 2>U,</v>

362
00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:03.501
<v Speaker 2>H,</v>
<v Speaker 2>g,</v>

363
00:22:03.501 --> 00:22:04.910
<v Speaker 2>H and Gerome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>g,</v>

364
00:22:04.911 --> 00:22:05.571
<v Speaker 2>H,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

365
00:22:05.571 --> 00:22:06.141
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>r,</v>

366
00:22:06.141 --> 00:22:06.974
<v Speaker 2>m,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and slew a Garam is the battle cry of </v>

367
00:22:09.351 --> 00:22:10.184
<v Speaker 2>the dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the problem with that sort of slogan </v>

368
00:22:13.191 --> 00:22:14.024
<v Speaker 2>is that it replaces independent thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's certainly possible that quote </v>

369
00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:20.360
<v Speaker 2>diversity is a strength,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an end quote.</v>

370
00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:23.180
<v Speaker 2>But the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the hell do you mean by diversity?</v>

371
00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:28.040
<v Speaker 2>And if the idea is that diverse modes of</v>
<v Speaker 2>approaching situations,</v>

372
00:22:28.041 --> 00:22:28.874
<v Speaker 2>nestle necessarily emerge because you've</v>
<v Speaker 2>gathered people together who were of </v>

373
00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:33.433
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are different in their whatever </v>

374
00:22:36.081 --> 00:22:39.530
<v Speaker 2>group identity marker happens to be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>privileged one at the moment,</v>

375
00:22:39.531 --> 00:22:40.364
<v Speaker 2>to use the postmodernists language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no indication whatsoever that </v>

376
00:22:42.891 --> 00:22:47.390
<v Speaker 2>that's going to produce diversity of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of strategic plan for example.</v>

377
00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:48.853
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an empty phrase and it's a </v>

378
00:22:51.801 --> 00:22:55.220
<v Speaker 2>dangerous phrase because diversity can </v>
<v Speaker 2>be a weakness.</v>

379
00:22:55.221 --> 00:22:56.890
<v Speaker 2>It's just as much as it can be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

380
00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:58.790
<v Speaker 2>can be a strength.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

381
00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:01.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's all right.</v>

382
00:23:01.401 --> 00:23:03.830
<v Speaker 2>It's a slogan and I don't like slogans </v>
<v Speaker 2>very much.</v>

383
00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:04.903
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

384
00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:10.520
<v Speaker 2>do you have any practical advice?</v>

385
00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:15.063
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

386
00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:16.630
<v Speaker 2>It's still on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just the cameras.</v>

387
00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:22.120
<v Speaker 2>The camera turned off for some reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have any practical advice?</v>

388
00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:27.350
<v Speaker 2>It's still an audio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

389
00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:28.193
<v Speaker 2>Well we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have all this new technology here </v>

390
00:23:29.161 --> 00:23:30.420
<v Speaker 2>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And sorry about that.</v>

391
00:23:30.421 --> 00:23:32.640
<v Speaker 2>It's still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're still working out the bugs.</v>

392
00:23:32.641 --> 00:23:36.130
<v Speaker 2>I bought new cameras and new lighting </v>
<v Speaker 2>and all of that and um,</v>

393
00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:39.930
<v Speaker 2>it does strange things that we don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand yet.</v>

394
00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:42.840
<v Speaker 2>And so it looks like I'm back on.</v>

395
00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:47.703
<v Speaker 2>So do you have any practical advice on </v>
<v Speaker 2>how I can improve my ability to </v>

396
00:23:50.151 --> 00:23:53.000
<v Speaker 2>concentrate and pay attention to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world around me?</v>

397
00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:55.130
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

398
00:23:55.131 --> 00:24:00.131
<v Speaker 2>I have some practical advice without the</v>
<v Speaker 2>first piece of practical advice.</v>

399
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.890
<v Speaker 2>Often the devil's in the details,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

400
00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:09.370
<v Speaker 2>but often some practical advice as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Regulate your,</v>

401
00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:13.360
<v Speaker 2>regulate your habits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

402
00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:16.760
<v Speaker 2>try to get up at approximately the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>time each morning.</v>

403
00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:19.760
<v Speaker 2>I would recommend that you get up </v>
<v Speaker 2>approximately when other people get up.</v>

404
00:24:19.761 --> 00:24:22.610
<v Speaker 2>So that would be something in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood of seven 30 or eight in the</v>

405
00:24:22.611 --> 00:24:25.190
<v Speaker 2>morning or perhaps earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps a little bit later.</v>

406
00:24:25.191 --> 00:24:28.070
<v Speaker 2>But you want to stabilize that because </v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

407
00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:31.900
<v Speaker 2>your circadian rhythms operate more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

408
00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:33.373
<v Speaker 2>what would you call it to fluidly and </v>
<v Speaker 2>your mood is likely to be regulated </v>

409
00:24:37.611 --> 00:24:41.840
<v Speaker 2>better if there's islands of stability </v>
<v Speaker 2>in your daily routines.</v>

410
00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:44.480
<v Speaker 2>Human beings like daily routines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like dogs,</v>

411
00:24:44.481 --> 00:24:47.690
<v Speaker 2>like daily routines and so regulate your</v>
<v Speaker 2>sleep.</v>

412
00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:49.143
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say when you get up in the </v>

413
00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:51.230
<v Speaker 2>morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat breakfast,</v>

414
00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:52.093
<v Speaker 2>that's a really important thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't tell you how many people I've </v>

415
00:24:55.011 --> 00:24:59.840
<v Speaker 2>treated in my clinical practice who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>proclivity for emotional instability and</v>

416
00:24:59.841 --> 00:25:01.220
<v Speaker 2>depression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anxiety,</v>

417
00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:03.530
<v Speaker 2>general hopelessness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

418
00:25:03.531 --> 00:25:08.531
<v Speaker 2>emotional pain and gloom and doom as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well as capacity to concentrate.</v>

419
00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:10.123
<v Speaker 2>We're property regulated or inhibited or</v>
<v Speaker 2>produced by merely ensuring that they </v>

420
00:25:15.681 --> 00:25:16.514
<v Speaker 2>ate a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say a protein and fat rich </v>

421
00:25:18.621 --> 00:25:21.290
<v Speaker 2>breakfast relatively soon after they </v>
<v Speaker 2>wake up.</v>

422
00:25:21.291 --> 00:25:23.030
<v Speaker 2>And that's especially too if they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>stressed.</v>

423
00:25:23.031 --> 00:25:27.410
<v Speaker 2>And as it turns out that if you stress </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself after a fast,</v>

424
00:25:27.411 --> 00:25:29.360
<v Speaker 2>which is of course what you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>undertaken,</v>

425
00:25:29.361 --> 00:25:32.330
<v Speaker 2>if you haven't eaten since the night </v>
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>

426
00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:36.230
<v Speaker 2>that your body produces enough insulin </v>
<v Speaker 2>to deplete your,</v>

427
00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:39.530
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your to deplete the sugar in your blood.</v>

428
00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:40.783
<v Speaker 2>And then it's very difficult for you to </v>
<v Speaker 2>become regulated properly with regards </v>

429
00:25:43.701 --> 00:25:46.910
<v Speaker 2>to your metabolism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>metabolism until you sleep again.</v>

430
00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:51.860
<v Speaker 2>And so it can be regulating your sleep </v>
<v Speaker 2>and your breakfast.</v>

431
00:25:51.861 --> 00:25:52.694
<v Speaker 2>Eating habits in particular can be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very effective way of regulating your </v>

432
00:25:55.251 --> 00:25:57.710
<v Speaker 2>mood and increasing your capacity to </v>
<v Speaker 2>concentrate.</v>

433
00:25:58.610 --> 00:25:59.443
<v Speaker 2>The other thing I would say is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>spending some time scheduling your time </v>

434
00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:07.300
<v Speaker 2>is also extraordinarily useful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I can tell you a little bit about</v>

435
00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:09.260
<v Speaker 2>about how to use schedule as </v>
<v Speaker 2>effectively.</v>

436
00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:10.513
<v Speaker 2>So the first thing I would do is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first thing I would say is that you </v>

437
00:26:14.721 --> 00:26:15.554
<v Speaker 2>should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

438
00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:20.030
<v Speaker 2>you should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should develop a longterm plan.</v>

439
00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:23.330
<v Speaker 2>You can use something like the future </v>
<v Speaker 2>authoring program,</v>

440
00:26:23.331 --> 00:26:24.164
<v Speaker 2>which most of you are familiar with </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of course you would have got a </v>

441
00:26:26.001 --> 00:26:26.834
<v Speaker 2>key to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Almost everyone as a consequence of </v>

442
00:26:29.361 --> 00:26:30.194
<v Speaker 2>being a patron is you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to set up your vision like </v>

443
00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:33.770
<v Speaker 2>Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

444
00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:37.400
<v Speaker 2>when he's looking at the Star before </v>
<v Speaker 2>Pinocchio's transformation takes place,</v>

445
00:26:37.401 --> 00:26:38.234
<v Speaker 2>you have to set up your longterm vision </v>
<v Speaker 2>to have some vision of the good towards </v>

446
00:26:42.051 --> 00:26:42.884
<v Speaker 2>which you're working and some vision </v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps of the hell that you're </v>

447
00:26:45.901 --> 00:26:46.734
<v Speaker 2>avoiding.</v>

448
00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:47.813
<v Speaker 2>And then I would say once you set up </v>
<v Speaker 2>that vision so that you know how to </v>

449
00:26:50.041 --> 00:26:50.874
<v Speaker 2>Orient Yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you should start designing your </v>

450
00:26:52.981 --> 00:26:53.814
<v Speaker 2>days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can do that very effectively </v>

451
00:26:54.901 --> 00:26:58.710
<v Speaker 2>with a calendar like Google calendar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And instead of many people say,</v>

452
00:26:58.711 --> 00:27:02.100
<v Speaker 2>well I hate using a schedule and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or I hate using a calendar.</v>

453
00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:03.593
<v Speaker 2>And what I would say about that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that if you hate using a schedule or </v>

454
00:27:06.781 --> 00:27:08.850
<v Speaker 2>a calendar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're probably using it wrong.</v>

455
00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:14.330
<v Speaker 2>What you're doing is using the calendar </v>
<v Speaker 2>as an external tyrant that's telling you</v>

456
00:27:15.871 --> 00:27:16.704
<v Speaker 2>what you should do if you were going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be a conventionally good person each </v>

457
00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:23.070
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you load yourself up with,</v>

458
00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:26.850
<v Speaker 2>with arbitrary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll say arbitrary responsibilities,</v>

459
00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:29.370
<v Speaker 2>but that's not really how you should use</v>
<v Speaker 2>a schedule.</v>

460
00:27:30.090 --> 00:27:30.923
<v Speaker 2>What you should use a schedule to do is </v>
<v Speaker 2>to design the day that you would most </v>

461
00:27:35.461 --> 00:27:36.294
<v Speaker 2>like to have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And obviously that's going to include </v>

462
00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:40.223
<v Speaker 2>accepting some responsibility and </v>
<v Speaker 2>undertaking to make progress on those </v>

463
00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:45.690
<v Speaker 2>things that you have to make progress </v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

464
00:27:45.691 --> 00:27:47.940
<v Speaker 2>to keep your life from collapsing into </v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos.</v>

465
00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:49.073
<v Speaker 2>But it should also mean that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>schedule in activities that make you </v>

466
00:27:52.321 --> 00:27:53.154
<v Speaker 2>actually want to have that day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if you're using a schedule </v>

467
00:27:56.281 --> 00:27:57.114
<v Speaker 2>properly that it can be your friend and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that can also be something that can </v>

468
00:28:00.031 --> 00:28:03.810
<v Speaker 2>increase your capacity to concentrate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I would say,</v>

469
00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:05.100
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>

470
00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:06.750
<v Speaker 2>if you're very scattered,</v>

471
00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:10.910
<v Speaker 2>then you can start to train yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might say,</v>

472
00:28:10.911 --> 00:28:11.744
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

473
00:28:12.050 --> 00:28:14.300
<v Speaker 2>I need to learn to read without </v>
<v Speaker 2>distraction.</v>

474
00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:16.850
<v Speaker 2>So maybe what you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>

475
00:28:16.851 --> 00:28:19.010
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well for the next week I'm going to read</v>

476
00:28:19.011 --> 00:28:22.640
<v Speaker 2>10 minutes a day and I'm going to try to</v>
<v Speaker 2>limit the distractions.</v>

477
00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:26.180
<v Speaker 2>And if you're successful at that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you could try 12 minutes a day.</v>

478
00:28:26.181 --> 00:28:29.150
<v Speaker 2>And if you're successful at that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could try 15 minutes a day.</v>

479
00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:30.433
<v Speaker 2>And the trick is to set a goal for </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself that is slightly beyond your </v>

480
00:28:34.131 --> 00:28:34.964
<v Speaker 2>current level of performance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>enough to be challenging enough to be </v>

481
00:28:38.241 --> 00:28:41.960
<v Speaker 2>worthwhile if you accomplished but not </v>
<v Speaker 2>so difficult that you're likely to fail.</v>

482
00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:43.213
<v Speaker 2>And then practice incrementally day by </v>
<v Speaker 2>day trying to inculcate the habits that </v>

483
00:28:46.611 --> 00:28:47.444
<v Speaker 2>you want to inculcate and assume that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll take you a number of months or </v>

484
00:28:50.481 --> 00:28:53.780
<v Speaker 2>even a number of years in order to </v>
<v Speaker 2>become very fluent at the habit.</v>

485
00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:55.133
<v Speaker 2>The important thing is to start </v>
<v Speaker 2>improving incrementally because </v>

486
00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:03.230
<v Speaker 2>incremental improvement pays off like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>compound interest.</v>

487
00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:04.543
<v Speaker 2>And so I would also say that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>trajectory that you're on is more </v>

488
00:29:06.741 --> 00:29:07.574
<v Speaker 2>important than your starting point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's also an extraordinarily </v>

489
00:29:09.831 --> 00:29:10.664
<v Speaker 2>optimistic observation because it means </v>
<v Speaker 2>that direction is more important than </v>

490
00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:17.990
<v Speaker 2>current position and enemy current </v>
<v Speaker 2>position matters obviously,</v>

491
00:29:17.991 --> 00:29:18.824
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it does matter as much as </v>

492
00:29:20.241 --> 00:29:21.074
<v Speaker 2>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you want to learn to concentrate </v>

493
00:29:23.541 --> 00:29:26.690
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>define what constitutes concentration,</v>

494
00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:27.733
<v Speaker 2>break it into micro habits and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>start practicing instantiation of those </v>

495
00:29:31.371 --> 00:29:33.380
<v Speaker 2>micro habits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

496
00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:38.750
<v Speaker 2>very good advice here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Robbie Kelly says,</v>

497
00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:42.070
<v Speaker 2>how do you eat an elephant?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You bite one chunk at a time.</v>

498
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:45.730
<v Speaker 2>Well that's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's also the hallmark of behavior</v>

499
00:29:45.731 --> 00:29:47.020
<v Speaker 2>therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the issue.</v>

500
00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:50.830
<v Speaker 2>So what a behavior therapist does and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm an admirer of behavior therapy,</v>

501
00:29:50.831 --> 00:29:55.831
<v Speaker 2>although there's other psychotherapeutic</v>
<v Speaker 2>approaches that I also appreciate too to</v>

502
00:29:56.261 --> 00:29:57.094
<v Speaker 2>a great degree for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for more that are in some sense more </v>

503
00:30:00.221 --> 00:30:03.330
<v Speaker 2>conceptually sophisticated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But one of the things you do if you're a</v>

504
00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:04.173
<v Speaker 2>behavior therapist is take the problem </v>
<v Speaker 2>at hand and decompose it into its micro </v>

505
00:30:08.321 --> 00:30:11.470
<v Speaker 2>elements and then practice </v>
<v Speaker 2>implementation of the micro elements.</v>

506
00:30:11.471 --> 00:30:15.070
<v Speaker 2>And that can be the integration of new </v>
<v Speaker 2>habits is already mentioned,</v>

507
00:30:15.071 --> 00:30:18.850
<v Speaker 2>but that's also a great way of learning </v>
<v Speaker 2>to face the things that you're avoiding.</v>

508
00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:22.180
<v Speaker 2>Learning to confront the things you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>avoiding that frightened you were,</v>

509
00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:25.570
<v Speaker 2>it stopped you in your trucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

510
00:30:25.571 --> 00:30:26.404
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're scared of going to parties or </v>

511
00:30:27.731 --> 00:30:28.564
<v Speaker 2>maybe scared of going out in public,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can also always go to the nearest </v>

512
00:30:30.971 --> 00:30:34.570
<v Speaker 2>bar for 10 minutes and sit there and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and have a drink and then leave,</v>

513
00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:35.433
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then maybe expand that up to 12 </v>

514
00:30:36.971 --> 00:30:37.804
<v Speaker 2>minutes and then maybe dare at one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the dare at one point when you grow up </v>

515
00:30:41.751 --> 00:30:42.850
<v Speaker 2>to say hi to someone.</v>

516
00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:44.253
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't ever underestimate the utility of </v>

517
00:30:46.661 --> 00:30:49.660
<v Speaker 2>incremental improvement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can get a tremendous distance by,</v>

518
00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:54.640
<v Speaker 2>by engaging in incremental improvement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

519
00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:56.950
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's see here.</v>

520
00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:07.740
<v Speaker 2>Why did I know how to upload my talk at </v>
<v Speaker 2>Western?</v>

521
00:31:07.741 --> 00:31:10.200
<v Speaker 2>University of that will be being </v>
<v Speaker 2>uploaded.</v>

522
00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:11.063
<v Speaker 2>There's a couple of talks I did that </v>
<v Speaker 2>just aren't the people that were </v>

523
00:31:13.381 --> 00:31:15.360
<v Speaker 2>preparing them just haven't got back to </v>
<v Speaker 2>me yet.</v>

524
00:31:15.390 --> 00:31:20.310
<v Speaker 2>I have a podcast that went quite nicely </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a German interviewer that I'm going</v>

525
00:31:20.311 --> 00:31:22.170
<v Speaker 2>to upload this weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was,</v>

526
00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:24.180
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

527
00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:25.703
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the western university talk will be </v>

528
00:31:27.001 --> 00:31:29.460
<v Speaker 2>uploaded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also did a talk in Calgary recently,</v>

529
00:31:29.730 --> 00:31:32.640
<v Speaker 2>which I talked about something new.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talked about equity,</v>

530
00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:33.503
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I believe is absolutely </v>

531
00:31:34.381 --> 00:31:36.060
<v Speaker 2>catastrophic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

532
00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:38.400
<v Speaker 2>goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say that's equality of outcome.</v>

533
00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:39.503
<v Speaker 2>I think the reason that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>catastrophic is because you can't have </v>

534
00:31:42.931 --> 00:31:43.764
<v Speaker 2>equality of outcome because you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>fractionate the group differences </v>

535
00:31:47.011 --> 00:31:49.320
<v Speaker 2>between people and an infinite number of</v>
<v Speaker 2>ways.</v>

536
00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:53.160
<v Speaker 2>So even if you did manage to produce </v>
<v Speaker 2>equality of outcome by you know,</v>

537
00:31:53.161 --> 00:31:56.700
<v Speaker 2>the two top contenders for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for prime group identity right now,</v>

538
00:31:56.701 --> 00:31:59.550
<v Speaker 2>which are race and gender being pushed </v>
<v Speaker 2>very hard by the left,</v>

539
00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:02.850
<v Speaker 2>which I would say is something that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>very racist and very sexist.</v>

540
00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:04.493
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might be able to reach equality of </v>

541
00:32:06.571 --> 00:32:07.404
<v Speaker 2>outcome across race and gender,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although you couldn't practically </v>

542
00:32:09.511 --> 00:32:11.760
<v Speaker 2>speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's say hypothetically you could,</v>

543
00:32:12.090 --> 00:32:14.640
<v Speaker 2>well then you'd still have to start to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fragment race.</v>

544
00:32:14.670 --> 00:32:18.030
<v Speaker 2>So what do you mean by race exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you going to stick with the three?</v>

545
00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:20.063
<v Speaker 2>Well you might describe them as </v>
<v Speaker 2>canonical racial differences negroid </v>

546
00:32:22.711 --> 00:32:23.544
<v Speaker 2>caucasoid in Asian or are you going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>start to fragment Asians into their </v>

547
00:32:27.091 --> 00:32:30.080
<v Speaker 2>various subtypes and exactly how are you</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to do that or no,</v>

548
00:32:30.081 --> 00:32:30.914
<v Speaker 2>are you going to do the same thing with </v>
<v Speaker 2>black people or are you going to just </v>

549
00:32:33.241 --> 00:32:36.330
<v Speaker 2>assume that they're all the same?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how do you know when someone's black</v>

550
00:32:36.331 --> 00:32:38.460
<v Speaker 2>and not just dark brown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>

551
00:32:38.461 --> 00:32:39.294
<v Speaker 2>or medium or light brown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'd also like to point out just in </v>

552
00:32:42.741 --> 00:32:45.350
<v Speaker 2>case anyone hasn't noticed that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't black and white,</v>

553
00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:47.660
<v Speaker 2>they're actually Tan and Brown.</v>

554
00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:50.480
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm saying that because there aren't</v>

555
00:32:50.481 --> 00:32:52.700
<v Speaker 2>clear distinctions between the racial </v>
<v Speaker 2>divides.</v>

556
00:32:52.701 --> 00:32:53.534
<v Speaker 2>And so you have to fragment race and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then obviously you have to fragment </v>

557
00:32:56.901 --> 00:32:59.330
<v Speaker 2>gender at least according to the gender </v>
<v Speaker 2>theorists.</v>

558
00:32:59.331 --> 00:33:03.050
<v Speaker 2>And then you have other problems of </v>
<v Speaker 2>group identity.</v>

559
00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:03.903
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you ensure that people are equally </v>

560
00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:11.030
<v Speaker 2>represented across levels of </v>
<v Speaker 2>attractiveness or height or extroversion</v>

561
00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:11.953
<v Speaker 2>or introversion or emotional stability </v>
<v Speaker 2>or mental health or physical health or </v>

562
00:33:17.751 --> 00:33:19.730
<v Speaker 2>age or?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

563
00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:20.593
<v Speaker 2>as you get the picture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to continue to repeat </v>

564
00:33:22.491 --> 00:33:24.170
<v Speaker 2>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is a,</v>

565
00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:26.480
<v Speaker 2>there is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are as many,</v>

566
00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:29.443
<v Speaker 2>there are an infinite number of </v>
<v Speaker 2>canonical group identities and there's </v>

567
00:33:31.581 --> 00:33:32.414
<v Speaker 2>no way of making a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an objective hierarchy out of them in </v>

568
00:33:35.721 --> 00:33:36.554
<v Speaker 2>terms of value.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you can't equate for equality of </v>

569
00:33:38.961 --> 00:33:41.690
<v Speaker 2>outcome up across all potential category</v>
<v Speaker 2>schemes.</v>

570
00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:44.360
<v Speaker 2>And so equality of outcome is a futile </v>
<v Speaker 2>endeavor.</v>

571
00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:48.020
<v Speaker 2>All that it does is transfer the power </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the free market should.</v>

572
00:33:48.510 --> 00:33:49.343
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially the free market as an </v>

573
00:33:50.841 --> 00:33:54.980
<v Speaker 2>externalized computational machine </v>
<v Speaker 2>should be calculating for us,</v>

574
00:33:55.010 --> 00:33:56.900
<v Speaker 2>even though it's an imperfect </v>
<v Speaker 2>calculation,</v>

575
00:33:57.330 --> 00:33:58.163
<v Speaker 2>all it does is transfer the power of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that collective and impersonal decision </v>

576
00:34:01.371 --> 00:34:04.940
<v Speaker 2>making into the hands of a coterie of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who will abs.</v>

577
00:34:05.050 --> 00:34:08.150
<v Speaker 2>Even if the initial people who have that</v>
<v Speaker 2>power don't misuse it,</v>

578
00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:10.850
<v Speaker 2>the people who take their place will </v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly misuse it.</v>

579
00:34:11.150 --> 00:34:12.530
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have Calgary,</v>

580
00:34:12.531 --> 00:34:15.590
<v Speaker 2>I did a talk on equity and tried to </v>
<v Speaker 2>outline some of these things.</v>

581
00:34:15.591 --> 00:34:16.424
<v Speaker 2>Trying to understand exactly what is </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong with the idea of equality of </v>

582
00:34:19.761 --> 00:34:20.594
<v Speaker 2>outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mean the historical data obviously </v>

583
00:34:21.981 --> 00:34:24.170
<v Speaker 2>indicates that it's a catastrophic </v>
<v Speaker 2>doctrine,</v>

584
00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:27.860
<v Speaker 2>but I think there are technical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychological,</v>

585
00:34:27.861 --> 00:34:28.694
<v Speaker 2>computational and complexity related </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasons why the doctrine of equality of </v>

586
00:34:33.051 --> 00:34:34.460
<v Speaker 2>outcome is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is uh,</v>

587
00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:37.340
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it's an impossible goal.</v>

588
00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:40.850
<v Speaker 2>It cannot be achieved even in principle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

589
00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:43.910
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

590
00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:02.500
<v Speaker 2>let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thinking skeptic says,</v>

591
00:35:02.501 --> 00:35:03.740
<v Speaker 2>I love you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dr [inaudible].</v>

592
00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:04.990
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank you very much.</v>

593
00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:06.460
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking skeptic.</v>

594
00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:09.030
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's conceivable that I love youtube,</v>

595
00:35:09.070 --> 00:35:09.903
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know because I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we'll assume that we can start from </v>

596
00:35:12.251 --> 00:35:13.084
<v Speaker 2>that perspective anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thoughts on the use of amphetamine to </v>

597
00:35:15.851 --> 00:35:17.760
<v Speaker 2>improve conscientiousness?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

598
00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:18.873
<v Speaker 2>the longterm data on use of amphetamine </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a treatment for attention deficit </v>

599
00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:25.900
<v Speaker 2>disorders suggest that there are no </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive medium to longterm benefits.</v>

600
00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:27.063
<v Speaker 2>So I would say that if you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>take a data driven approach to that </v>

601
00:35:30.250 --> 00:35:31.083
<v Speaker 2>issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you would draw the conclusion that </v>

602
00:35:32.801 --> 00:35:35.070
<v Speaker 2>it's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a useful long term,</v>

603
00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:36.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>solution.</v>

604
00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:38.073
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

605
00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:42.103
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

606
00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:46.760
<v Speaker 2>I experienced tremendous abuse as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>child and it's led to me being a doormat</v>

607
00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:47.633
<v Speaker 2>for abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I seek out people who reject me and </v>

608
00:35:50.131 --> 00:35:52.980
<v Speaker 2>reject people who seek me out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do I break this cycle?</v>

609
00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:54.540
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's a really,</v>

610
00:35:54.541 --> 00:35:55.374
<v Speaker 2>really hard question and the reason that</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard apart from the fact that your </v>

611
00:35:58.891 --> 00:36:02.670
<v Speaker 2>situation is very complex is that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>devil's always in the details.</v>

612
00:36:03.210 --> 00:36:08.210
<v Speaker 2>What I would recommend though is that if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to break that cycle,</v>

613
00:36:08.401 --> 00:36:11.490
<v Speaker 2>the first thing you need to do is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out what it is that you want.</v>

614
00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:16.320
<v Speaker 2>You need to understand where it is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to go in your life and you need</v>

615
00:36:16.321 --> 00:36:17.154
<v Speaker 2>to understand what people would look </v>
<v Speaker 2>like if they were the kind of people </v>

616
00:36:21.121 --> 00:36:23.970
<v Speaker 2>that you could surround yourself with to</v>
<v Speaker 2>facilitate that goal.</v>

617
00:36:23.971 --> 00:36:24.804
<v Speaker 2>And so I would again recommend that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>do the future authoring program so that </v>

618
00:36:27.781 --> 00:36:28.614
<v Speaker 2>you can get your goals in order and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to start thinking through how </v>

619
00:36:32.611 --> 00:36:36.480
<v Speaker 2>it is that you would like to be treated </v>
<v Speaker 2>and what your strategies would be.</v>

620
00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:37.553
<v Speaker 2>Even in principle if you find yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>not being treated that way and then you </v>

621
00:36:41.101 --> 00:36:44.430
<v Speaker 2>have to start practicing that at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>level of micro routine.</v>

622
00:36:45.090 --> 00:36:47.220
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think one of the ways that you can</v>

623
00:36:47.221 --> 00:36:48.054
<v Speaker 2>do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is something I often recommend </v>

624
00:36:49.381 --> 00:36:50.214
<v Speaker 2>to agreeable people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that he will see that there are </v>

625
00:36:53.611 --> 00:36:54.444
<v Speaker 2>people who treat you in a manner that </v>
<v Speaker 2>leads to the development of your </v>

626
00:36:57.511 --> 00:36:59.340
<v Speaker 2>resentment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feelings of resentment.</v>

627
00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:04.770
<v Speaker 2>And now there's roughly two reasons why </v>
<v Speaker 2>you might feel resentful and one is that</v>

628
00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:05.993
<v Speaker 2>your just windy and someone is calling </v>
<v Speaker 2>you on your misbehavior or you're </v>

629
00:37:09.511 --> 00:37:12.300
<v Speaker 2>failing because you should be failing </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're not.</v>

630
00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:17.220
<v Speaker 2>Your character isn't well developed </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough to merely adjust to the error and</v>

631
00:37:17.221 --> 00:37:18.054
<v Speaker 2>to fix yourself up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the other is that you're being </v>

632
00:37:20.521 --> 00:37:23.880
<v Speaker 2>genuinely taken advantage of and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to put a stop to it.</v>

633
00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:25.343
<v Speaker 2>And the only way that you can really </v>
<v Speaker 2>figure that out is by thinking it </v>

634
00:37:27.331 --> 00:37:30.110
<v Speaker 2>through or writing it down or perhaps by</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking to someone that,</v>

635
00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:31.003
<v Speaker 2>that you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that cares for you in a positive </v>

636
00:37:32.971 --> 00:37:33.804
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

637
00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:40.473
<v Speaker 2>Once you've done that and once you </v>
<v Speaker 2>realize that you're resentful because </v>

638
00:37:43.961 --> 00:37:44.794
<v Speaker 2>you are being interfered with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's incumbent on you to say </v>

639
00:37:47.501 --> 00:37:48.334
<v Speaker 2>something so that it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it comes to a stop and you'll have to </v>

640
00:37:51.011 --> 00:37:53.650
<v Speaker 2>practice that it and you'll be bad at it</v>
<v Speaker 2>to begin with.</v>

641
00:37:54.430 --> 00:37:55.263
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might be that your interact with </v>

642
00:37:56.261 --> 00:37:57.094
<v Speaker 2>someone and you don't realize until </v>
<v Speaker 2>hours later that you don't like the </v>

643
00:38:00.101 --> 00:38:01.990
<v Speaker 2>interaction that you had something to </v>
<v Speaker 2>say.</v>

644
00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:03.093
<v Speaker 2>You might have to sit at home and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out what it is that you should </v>

645
00:38:05.531 --> 00:38:06.364
<v Speaker 2>say should have said and then go back </v>
<v Speaker 2>and tell the person you're going to be </v>

646
00:38:08.741 --> 00:38:10.810
<v Speaker 2>awkward and bad at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's a good start.</v>

647
00:38:11.470 --> 00:38:14.530
<v Speaker 2>And maybe you need to write out why it </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that you shouldn't be allowing people</v>

648
00:38:14.531 --> 00:38:15.364
<v Speaker 2>to mistreat you so that you replace your</v>
<v Speaker 2>habitual proclivity that was may be </v>

649
00:38:19.930 --> 00:38:20.763
<v Speaker 2>instilled in you when you were a child </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a thought through and mature </v>

650
00:38:23.531 --> 00:38:25.630
<v Speaker 2>philosophy of interpersonal </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship.</v>

651
00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:28.060
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a reasonable start.</v>

652
00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:33.880
<v Speaker 2>So is it safe to go into psychology in </v>
<v Speaker 2>university?</v>

653
00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:37.120
<v Speaker 2>Definitely not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not safe to study psychology.</v>

654
00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:39.790
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not really the issue.</v>

655
00:38:39.791 --> 00:38:40.624
<v Speaker 2>I think what you mean has is has </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychology been so corrupted by let's </v>

656
00:38:44.441 --> 00:38:45.274
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>political correctness so that it's no </v>

657
00:38:46.181 --> 00:38:49.020
<v Speaker 2>longer a reasonable pathway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's no,</v>

658
00:38:49.070 --> 00:38:49.903
<v Speaker 2>no longer a reasonable discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would say I don't think it's </v>

659
00:38:53.021 --> 00:38:53.854
<v Speaker 2>corrupted to that degree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would also say that one of the </v>

660
00:38:56.801 --> 00:38:59.260
<v Speaker 2>things you need to understand if you are</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to university,</v>

661
00:38:59.261 --> 00:39:04.261
<v Speaker 2>that is that fundamentally university is</v>
<v Speaker 2>a place where you educate yourself.</v>

662
00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:05.493
<v Speaker 2>Now you can seek out people who have </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge and confer with them about </v>

663
00:39:09.311 --> 00:39:10.144
<v Speaker 2>your own education,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the primary responsibility has to </v>

664
00:39:12.191 --> 00:39:13.024
<v Speaker 2>fall to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the libraries and [inaudible] full of </v>

665
00:39:14.981 --> 00:39:15.814
<v Speaker 2>great books.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can find out what the great </v>

666
00:39:17.531 --> 00:39:18.364
<v Speaker 2>books are in a relative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a relatively short order manner by </v>

667
00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:23.080
<v Speaker 2>just by even just looking online.</v>

668
00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:24.633
<v Speaker 2>And you can do a tremendous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>reading and a tremendous amount of </v>

669
00:39:26.711 --> 00:39:27.544
<v Speaker 2>writing on your own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can do that very effectively if </v>

670
00:39:29.921 --> 00:39:34.921
<v Speaker 2>you also treat your university </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience with the same degree of,</v>

671
00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:37.040
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

672
00:39:37.210 --> 00:39:39.010
<v Speaker 2>what would you call diligence that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>might,</v>

673
00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:41.680
<v Speaker 2>that you might put towards a full time </v>
<v Speaker 2>job.</v>

674
00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:43.473
<v Speaker 2>So you want to find the professors that </v>
<v Speaker 2>have something to say and select them </v>

675
00:39:47.410 --> 00:39:48.243
<v Speaker 2>and you want to do the readings of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>great books and you want to learn to </v>

676
00:39:50.171 --> 00:39:51.700
<v Speaker 2>write.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you do that,</v>

677
00:39:51.701 --> 00:39:52.534
<v Speaker 2>then you'll receive an education.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can do that pretty much at any </v>

678
00:39:54.641 --> 00:39:59.350
<v Speaker 2>university I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what music do I like?</v>

679
00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:02.860
<v Speaker 2>I like a lot of different music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like a lot of different genres.</v>

680
00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:06.100
<v Speaker 2>I listen to rock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a dinosaur.</v>

681
00:40:06.101 --> 00:40:10.220
<v Speaker 2>So I listened to classic rock all often </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the 70s I'm,</v>

682
00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:11.103
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was wired up and imprinted on that </v>

683
00:40:12.521 --> 00:40:12.850
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

684
00:40:12.850 --> 00:40:17.850
<v Speaker 2>But I listened to rock music from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fifties through today.</v>

685
00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:21.190
<v Speaker 2>I really liked the band arcade fire for </v>
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>

686
00:40:21.191 --> 00:40:22.810
<v Speaker 2>a beach houses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a new band.</v>

687
00:40:22.811 --> 00:40:23.644
<v Speaker 2>I kind of liked them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a band called Devotchka that I </v>

688
00:40:26.171 --> 00:40:27.490
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're out of Seattle.</v>

689
00:40:27.491 --> 00:40:29.500
<v Speaker 2>I think they're really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love Tom Waits.</v>

690
00:40:29.830 --> 00:40:30.663
<v Speaker 2>I like old country music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Western stuff from the forties </v>

691
00:40:32.890 --> 00:40:35.710
<v Speaker 2>thirties forties and 50s.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I listened to jazz.</v>

692
00:40:35.711 --> 00:40:38.410
<v Speaker 2>I like blues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I listen to classical music.</v>

693
00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:40.360
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

694
00:40:40.690 --> 00:40:42.640
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I mentioned Tom White's already,</v>

695
00:40:42.641 --> 00:40:47.641
<v Speaker 2>who I think is an absolute genius,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't remember who said it once,</v>

696
00:40:47.861 --> 00:40:49.960
<v Speaker 2>but someone said there was only two </v>
<v Speaker 2>kinds of music,</v>

697
00:40:49.961 --> 00:40:53.080
<v Speaker 2>good music and bad music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I really believe that's true.</v>

698
00:40:53.081 --> 00:40:53.914
<v Speaker 2>And so I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've found what I regard as great music </v>

699
00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:58.080
<v Speaker 2>in all sorts of genres.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

700
00:40:58.750 --> 00:41:02.680
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say I'm a hip hop officio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's some of it that I've learned</v>

701
00:41:02.681 --> 00:41:03.460
<v Speaker 2>to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

702
00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:05.230
<v Speaker 2>I really like m and m's rap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

703
00:41:05.231 --> 00:41:07.750
<v Speaker 2>I think that's an absolutely remarkable </v>
<v Speaker 2>song.</v>

704
00:41:07.751 --> 00:41:08.584
<v Speaker 2>He's unbelievably skilled in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>ability to annunciate and I think </v>

705
00:41:11.651 --> 00:41:15.100
<v Speaker 2>there's high quality music being </v>
<v Speaker 2>produced across a wide range of genres.</v>

706
00:41:15.101 --> 00:41:17.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't like pop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>generally speaking.</v>

707
00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:20.410
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it all sounds like bad.</v>

708
00:41:20.411 --> 00:41:24.190
<v Speaker 2>1970s disco to me and I didn't like bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>1970s disco,</v>

709
00:41:24.370 --> 00:41:28.960
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's what I liked for music.</v>

710
00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:30.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's see,</v>

711
00:41:30.281 --> 00:41:31.420
<v Speaker 2>what else have we got here?</v>

712
00:41:33.850 --> 00:41:34.060
<v Speaker 2>What</v>

713
00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:34.893
<v Speaker 2>do I think of the comments?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The role favorable to me on that recent </v>

714
00:41:37.241 --> 00:41:39.520
<v Speaker 2>Hamilton article.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hamilton's a city,</v>

715
00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:42.580
<v Speaker 2>the city where mcmaster university is </v>
<v Speaker 2>being disappeared.</v>

716
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:44.410
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what to think of that.</v>

717
00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:45.730
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

718
00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:47.980
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my gut instinct,</v>

719
00:41:47.981 --> 00:41:50.590
<v Speaker 2>and I would use this as a good rule of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thumb,</v>

720
00:41:50.591 --> 00:41:55.591
<v Speaker 2>is to assume ignorance or error or </v>
<v Speaker 2>stupidity before you assume malevolence.</v>

721
00:41:57.011 --> 00:42:00.490
<v Speaker 2>And so you have to go through those </v>
<v Speaker 2>alternative explanations first.</v>

722
00:42:00.491 --> 00:42:01.324
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why the comments were </v>

723
00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:03.840
<v Speaker 2>shutdown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

724
00:42:03.970 --> 00:42:06.550
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be easy to assume the worst,</v>

725
00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:09.730
<v Speaker 2>but there's no reason to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to jump to the assumption</v>

726
00:42:09.731 --> 00:42:10.564
<v Speaker 2>of the worst to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I thought it was curious and so I </v>

727
00:42:13.751 --> 00:42:16.750
<v Speaker 2>tweeted it and I do think it's curious </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I do think that the,</v>

728
00:42:17.110 --> 00:42:17.943
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the threat of invisible Internet </v>

729
00:42:20.831 --> 00:42:21.664
<v Speaker 2>censorship is a real one because w we </v>
<v Speaker 2>are conversing increasingly in this </v>

730
00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:27.213
<v Speaker 2>public artificial intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>giant invisible corporation mediated </v>

731
00:42:32.021 --> 00:42:32.740
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

732
00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:35.590
<v Speaker 2>And we don't know what the rules are and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't know who can make them.</v>

733
00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:36.513
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that's something we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>really going to have to watch out for </v>

734
00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:40.103
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you can see that happening with </v>

735
00:42:40.961 --> 00:42:44.710
<v Speaker 2>facebook and twitter and perhaps with </v>
<v Speaker 2>youtube,</v>

736
00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:46.570
<v Speaker 2>although I think youtube still pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>clean,</v>

737
00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:47.433
<v Speaker 2>although you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen people complaining that </v>

738
00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:54.720
<v Speaker 2>they're losing subscribers and that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that their content is being restricted.</v>

739
00:42:54.970 --> 00:42:55.803
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing is the company is going gonna </v>

740
00:42:56.441 --> 00:42:57.274
<v Speaker 2>make some mistakes there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to do multiple things at </v>

741
00:43:00.491 --> 00:43:01.990
<v Speaker 2>the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so like I said,</v>

742
00:43:01.991 --> 00:43:04.240
<v Speaker 2>I would assume,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

743
00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:05.223
<v Speaker 2>error and ignorance and stupidity and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then malevolence in that order and you </v>

744
00:43:08.861 --> 00:43:09.694
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give,</v>

745
00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:13.150
<v Speaker 2>give people who are trying to mediate </v>
<v Speaker 2>these new technologies a bit of a break,</v>

746
00:43:13.151 --> 00:43:13.984
<v Speaker 2>but that's still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should be awake because there is </v>

747
00:43:17.050 --> 00:43:17.883
<v Speaker 2>always the potential for new and </v>
<v Speaker 2>unforeseen threats to emerge to freedom </v>

748
00:43:21.491 --> 00:43:23.410
<v Speaker 2>of speech when it's electronically </v>
<v Speaker 2>mediated.</v>

749
00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:24.783
<v Speaker 2>So</v>
<v Speaker 2>how will rescuing my father from the </v>

750
00:43:33.601 --> 00:43:38.601
<v Speaker 2>belly of the whale helped me with </v>
<v Speaker 2>regards to leftist ideology?</v>

751
00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:42.720
<v Speaker 2>Well I hope it would help you with </v>
<v Speaker 2>regards to ideologies in general.</v>

752
00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:48.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a serious,</v>

753
00:43:48.421 --> 00:43:50.040
<v Speaker 2>that's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very serious question</v>

754
00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:54.013
<v Speaker 2>to believe that rescuing your father </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the belly of the whale would </v>

755
00:43:58.280 --> 00:43:59.113
<v Speaker 2>inoculate you against ideology is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>accept it particular interpretation of </v>

756
00:44:03.051 --> 00:44:04.520
<v Speaker 2>what that story means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

757
00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:07.280
<v Speaker 2>my interpretation of that story is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the whale,</v>

758
00:44:07.850 --> 00:44:12.850
<v Speaker 2>the whale dragon is a symbol of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>predatory unknown.</v>

759
00:44:13.850 --> 00:44:16.430
<v Speaker 2>So it's a symbol of the dangers that </v>
<v Speaker 2>lurk in the unknown.</v>

760
00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:17.713
<v Speaker 2>And the idea that the father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dying father or the or the ghost </v>

761
00:44:21.790 --> 00:44:22.623
<v Speaker 2>father or the deceased father is lying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somehow inert in that landscape means </v>

762
00:44:28.371 --> 00:44:29.204
<v Speaker 2>that encountering chaos can help you </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand more clearly what the value </v>

763
00:44:34.111 --> 00:44:34.944
<v Speaker 2>was in traditional order.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's not only traditional order </v>

764
00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:38.620
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

765
00:44:38.620 --> 00:44:42.060
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that is the domain say of the,</v>

766
00:44:42.270 --> 00:44:43.103
<v Speaker 2>of the resurrecting farther.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's partly the farther represents </v>

767
00:44:47.101 --> 00:44:51.900
<v Speaker 2>partly the spirit of the social order </v>
<v Speaker 2>and partly the,</v>

768
00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:55.590
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the implicit logos that's characteristic</v>

769
00:44:55.591 --> 00:44:59.070
<v Speaker 2>of the individual that acts to create </v>
<v Speaker 2>society across time.</v>

770
00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:04.020
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you identify with tradition as,</v>

771
00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:04.973
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as the foundation of being and you </v>

772
00:45:07.770 --> 00:45:12.330
<v Speaker 2>understand what identifying with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>spirit that creates tradition means,</v>

773
00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:15.420
<v Speaker 2>then that gives you a means of orienting</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>

774
00:45:15.421 --> 00:45:19.200
<v Speaker 2>That's far preferable to any pure </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideology,</v>

775
00:45:19.201 --> 00:45:23.340
<v Speaker 2>whether it's hiding in the nationals </v>
<v Speaker 2>structures that the right promotes,</v>

776
00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:25.920
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which tend towards rigidity,</v>

777
00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:29.250
<v Speaker 2>rigidity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and hyper order or drowning in the chaos</v>

778
00:45:29.251 --> 00:45:30.084
<v Speaker 2>that the left producers in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>attempts both to demolish order sort of </v>

779
00:45:35.071 --> 00:45:37.100
<v Speaker 2>on the negative end and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

780
00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:41.550
<v Speaker 2>transmuted say on the positive end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's better to,</v>

781
00:45:42.690 --> 00:45:45.750
<v Speaker 2>I think it's better to act your life out</v>
<v Speaker 2>as an individual,</v>

782
00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:50.280
<v Speaker 2>to incorporate the traditions that your </v>
<v Speaker 2>society has have brought forward to you,</v>

783
00:45:50.281 --> 00:45:51.680
<v Speaker 2>into your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to,</v>

784
00:45:51.830 --> 00:45:54.000
<v Speaker 2>to do what other people do and to do it </v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

785
00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:55.650
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to grow up,</v>

786
00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:56.753
<v Speaker 2>to move out of your house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to adopt the responsibilities of a </v>

787
00:45:59.701 --> 00:46:01.860
<v Speaker 2>family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to learn how to be honest,</v>

788
00:46:01.890 --> 00:46:02.723
<v Speaker 2>to take on the heavy load of helping to </v>
<v Speaker 2>reduce unnecessary suffering in the </v>

789
00:46:06.661 --> 00:46:09.540
<v Speaker 2>world and to try to make something </v>
<v Speaker 2>productive and useful of yourself.</v>

790
00:46:09.541 --> 00:46:12.480
<v Speaker 2>And that's a lot more interesting and </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaningful than trying to,</v>

791
00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:13.783
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>manifest yourself as the incarnation of </v>

792
00:46:17.911 --> 00:46:19.740
<v Speaker 2>a pathological ideology.</v>

793
00:46:45.370 --> 00:46:46.203
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

794
00:46:47.470 --> 00:46:49.210
<v Speaker 2>What the hell is it doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dying?</v>

795
00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:01.630
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I turned it back on.</v>

796
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:03.833
<v Speaker 2>You don't game,</v>

797
00:47:06.050 --> 00:47:07.570
<v Speaker 1>you stopped recording too,</v>

798
00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:29.280
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm,</v>

799
00:47:29.350 --> 00:47:31.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I looks like I'm back.</v>

800
00:47:31.001 --> 00:47:33.140
<v Speaker 2>There's a lag on the q and a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>

801
00:47:33.141 --> 00:47:33.974
<v Speaker 2>it's somewhat difficult to d Sherman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the Shaman to what did the Sherman </v>

802
00:47:38.711 --> 00:47:39.760
<v Speaker 2>and D Sherman?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

803
00:47:40.030 --> 00:47:41.650
<v Speaker 2>Hi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm</v>

804
00:47:52.370 --> 00:47:53.203
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody says that this is the fault of </v>

805
00:47:58.491 --> 00:48:00.080
<v Speaker 2>postmodernist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably is,</v>

806
00:48:00.081 --> 00:48:01.200
<v Speaker 2>it probably is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

807
00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:02.073
<v Speaker 2>that would be my guest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're probably putting like some kind </v>

808
00:48:04.011 --> 00:48:07.010
<v Speaker 2>of electronic bug in my camera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why it's shutting off.</v>

809
00:48:07.011 --> 00:48:09.730
<v Speaker 2>I'll sort that out later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Julian,</v>

810
00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:12.620
<v Speaker 2>we need you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess you heard that a,</v>

811
00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:14.420
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

812
00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:15.470
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

813
00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:20.680
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

814
00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:25.600
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How,</v>

815
00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:27.240
<v Speaker 2>don't yell at Julian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get you now.</v>

816
00:48:27.241 --> 00:48:28.240
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to yell at him.</v>

817
00:48:28.241 --> 00:48:29.690
<v Speaker 2>He's my son.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can yell at him.</v>

818
00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:32.050
<v Speaker 2>He's my technical support actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's really good at it then.</v>

819
00:48:32.051 --> 00:48:34.660
<v Speaker 2>I hardly ever yell at them to rough life</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me though.</v>

820
00:48:36.410 --> 00:48:38.770
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say here,</v>

821
00:48:48.270 --> 00:48:49.950
<v Speaker 2>take another question from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>

822
00:48:50.100 --> 00:48:52.650
<v Speaker 2>so someone says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's up with the socks?</v>

823
00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:54.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I have,</v>

824
00:48:54.330 --> 00:48:55.163
<v Speaker 2>I guess I need to dim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I need to indicate to the rest </v>

825
00:48:58.171 --> 00:48:59.004
<v Speaker 2>of you just exactly what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see these are the socks that we're </v>

826
00:49:01.051 --> 00:49:02.960
<v Speaker 2>talking about here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

827
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:07.340
<v Speaker 2>my wife bought me some fancy socks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>

828
00:49:07.550 --> 00:49:08.383
<v Speaker 2>my wife bought me some fancy socks for </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christmas and so I guess she thought my </v>

829
00:49:11.311 --> 00:49:12.144
<v Speaker 2>style needed upgrading.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess it was partly because I got </v>

830
00:49:14.461 --> 00:49:19.140
<v Speaker 2>completely reward robe to here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess that might be a word in the last</v>

831
00:49:19.140 --> 00:49:19.973
<v Speaker 2>few months I lost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've lost a tremendous amount of weight </v>

832
00:49:21.451 --> 00:49:24.510
<v Speaker 2>in the last year about 40 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

833
00:49:24.511 --> 00:49:26.820
<v Speaker 2>some of that might be due to social </v>
<v Speaker 2>justice warriors.</v>

834
00:49:26.821 --> 00:49:29.880
<v Speaker 2>So although it's really not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's because I've transformed my diet.</v>

835
00:49:29.881 --> 00:49:30.714
<v Speaker 2>I seem to have a variety of dietary </v>
<v Speaker 2>sensitivities that seem to be </v>

836
00:49:35.010 --> 00:49:36.570
<v Speaker 2>contributing to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

837
00:49:36.930 --> 00:49:37.763
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had a history of depression and </v>

838
00:49:40.081 --> 00:49:42.180
<v Speaker 2>that looks like it might be associated </v>
<v Speaker 2>with diet.</v>

839
00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:46.800
<v Speaker 2>And my daughter who's been very ill with</v>
<v Speaker 2>a variety of health problems,</v>

840
00:49:46.801 --> 00:49:49.440
<v Speaker 2>including extraordinarily serious </v>
<v Speaker 2>arthritis.</v>

841
00:49:49.710 --> 00:49:53.940
<v Speaker 2>She lost her ankle and her hip to </v>
<v Speaker 2>arthritis when she was 17.</v>

842
00:49:54.510 --> 00:49:58.470
<v Speaker 2>She's figured out that a lot of her </v>
<v Speaker 2>autoimmune problems were associated with</v>

843
00:49:58.471 --> 00:50:00.040
<v Speaker 2>severe dietary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

844
00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:03.410
<v Speaker 2>sensitivity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we share some symptom overlap.</v>

845
00:50:03.411 --> 00:50:05.970
<v Speaker 2>So I've had some autoimmune illness </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems.</v>

846
00:50:05.971 --> 00:50:09.480
<v Speaker 2>And so she went on a very restrictive </v>
<v Speaker 2>diet,</v>

847
00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:13.450
<v Speaker 2>which was basically only chicken and </v>
<v Speaker 2>vegetables and it,</v>

848
00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:16.800
<v Speaker 2>it stopped the vast majority of her </v>
<v Speaker 2>symptoms,</v>

849
00:50:16.801 --> 00:50:20.880
<v Speaker 2>including extreme fatigue and depression</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the arthritis itself.</v>

850
00:50:20.881 --> 00:50:25.290
<v Speaker 2>And it had quite a market impact on her </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the point where she could stop taking</v>

851
00:50:25.291 --> 00:50:27.560
<v Speaker 2>antidepressants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so about a year and half ago,</v>

852
00:50:27.561 --> 00:50:29.620
<v Speaker 2>she convinced me to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

853
00:50:30.650 --> 00:50:34.550
<v Speaker 2>try the diet for a month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that meant well,</v>

854
00:50:34.610 --> 00:50:35.443
<v Speaker 2>it meant eating nothing but meat and </v>
<v Speaker 2>vegetables and that would beef chicken </v>

855
00:50:38.691 --> 00:50:39.710
<v Speaker 2>and vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

856
00:50:39.740 --> 00:50:41.330
<v Speaker 2>No carbohydrates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no nuts,</v>

857
00:50:41.450 --> 00:50:43.010
<v Speaker 2>no nightshades,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no beans,</v>

858
00:50:43.820 --> 00:50:45.800
<v Speaker 2>no dairy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no chocolate,</v>

859
00:50:45.830 --> 00:50:47.480
<v Speaker 2>no fruit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no sugar.</v>

860
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:48.343
<v Speaker 2>Like unbelievably restrictive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been a real pain because it's </v>

861
00:50:50.990 --> 00:50:53.300
<v Speaker 2>really compromised my social life </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're like,</v>

862
00:50:53.301 --> 00:50:56.360
<v Speaker 2>who's going to invite you out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because so many people,</v>

863
00:50:56.570 --> 00:50:57.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

864
00:50:57.520 --> 00:51:00.080
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so much of what people do socially,</v>

865
00:51:00.081 --> 00:51:02.720
<v Speaker 2>it revolves around eating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you're really a royal pain in the</v>

866
00:51:02.721 --> 00:51:06.470
<v Speaker 2>neck with when it comes to your dietary </v>
<v Speaker 2>proclivities,</v>

867
00:51:06.471 --> 00:51:09.530
<v Speaker 2>then people are just not going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>very happy about you.</v>

868
00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:11.353
<v Speaker 2>Anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried the Diet for a month and I lost </v>

869
00:51:13.461 --> 00:51:14.760
<v Speaker 2>about seven pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I've,</v>

870
00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:16.340
<v Speaker 2>and I quit snoring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

871
00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:18.860
<v Speaker 2>which had been plaguing me to some </v>
<v Speaker 2>degree.</v>

872
00:51:18.861 --> 00:51:20.630
<v Speaker 2>And so I thought that was pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>

873
00:51:20.631 --> 00:51:21.890
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

874
00:51:21.891 --> 00:51:23.840
<v Speaker 2>so I just stayed on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I lost,</v>

875
00:51:24.890 --> 00:51:26.990
<v Speaker 2>I kept losing them about that much </v>
<v Speaker 2>weight per month.</v>

876
00:51:26.991 --> 00:51:30.350
<v Speaker 2>So I went down from about 212 pounds to </v>
<v Speaker 2>my current weight,</v>

877
00:51:30.351 --> 00:51:31.184
<v Speaker 2>which is about one 70,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is about where it was when I was </v>

878
00:51:34.401 --> 00:51:37.010
<v Speaker 2>in graduate school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so anyways,</v>

879
00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:39.080
<v Speaker 2>this is a long answer to this question.</v>

880
00:51:39.810 --> 00:51:40.643
<v Speaker 1>MMM.</v>

881
00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:45.480
<v Speaker 2>Because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all my clothing became tent like,</v>

882
00:51:45.660 --> 00:51:46.493
<v Speaker 2>and I had to throw all of it away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I got some new clothes in more </v>

883
00:51:50.461 --> 00:51:53.550
<v Speaker 2>recently and including some very </v>
<v Speaker 2>colorful socks.</v>

884
00:51:53.730 --> 00:51:56.140
<v Speaker 2>So I guess that's my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

885
00:51:57.360 --> 00:51:59.670
<v Speaker 2>what would you say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what else to say about it,</v>

886
00:51:59.671 --> 00:52:00.504
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I have these colorful socks and </v>

887
00:52:01.710 --> 00:52:04.740
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're kind of interesting and stylish.</v>

888
00:52:04.741 --> 00:52:09.290
<v Speaker 2>And so that's what's with the socks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a complicated answer.</v>

889
00:52:09.291 --> 00:52:10.470
<v Speaker 2>Hey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

890
00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:12.153
<v Speaker 1>mmm.</v>

891
00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:22.750
<v Speaker 2>Can you please take some questions </v>
<v Speaker 2>submitted via patron advance?</v>

892
00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:24.890
<v Speaker 2>I did do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did take questions.</v>

893
00:52:24.891 --> 00:52:27.770
<v Speaker 2>I guess you might mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do I answer that?</v>

894
00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:29.750
<v Speaker 2>Will I answer some more of the questions</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

895
00:52:29.751 --> 00:52:30.680
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can do that.</v>

896
00:52:30.890 --> 00:52:31.723
<v Speaker 2>I think what I would recommend everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we'll get better at this and I'm </v>

897
00:52:34.911 --> 00:52:35.930
<v Speaker 2>going to keep doing it.</v>

898
00:52:36.650 --> 00:52:39.810
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where'd it go here?</v>

899
00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:44.773
<v Speaker 2>There are a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many of the questions that were </v>

900
00:52:46.231 --> 00:52:47.064
<v Speaker 2>submitted on Patrion were very long and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's going to work </v>

901
00:52:50.521 --> 00:52:52.030
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

902
00:52:52.530 --> 00:52:55.260
<v Speaker 2>it takes a long time to read the long </v>
<v Speaker 2>questions and</v>

903
00:52:56.720 --> 00:52:58.670
<v Speaker 2>that means I can't answer very many of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

904
00:52:58.671 --> 00:52:59.504
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to submit a question on </v>

905
00:53:01.521 --> 00:53:03.650
<v Speaker 2>Patrion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least for the time being,</v>

906
00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:04.693
<v Speaker 2>you might,</v>
<v Speaker 2>might want to make them not more than </v>

907
00:53:05.841 --> 00:53:08.570
<v Speaker 2>about maybe for la,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four or five lines long.</v>

908
00:53:09.350 --> 00:53:10.183
<v Speaker 2>Cause I also have to scan through a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of questions to find out which ones not </v>

909
00:53:13.911 --> 00:53:16.670
<v Speaker 2>only are worth answering because I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>many of them are worth answering.</v>

910
00:53:16.671 --> 00:53:20.360
<v Speaker 2>But which ones I've got an answer at </v>
<v Speaker 2>hand for because I can't</v>

911
00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:22.783
<v Speaker 2>sit here and think and produce dead air </v>
<v Speaker 2>for periods of time for this to work </v>

912
00:53:27.541 --> 00:53:31.290
<v Speaker 2>properly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we'll figure this out as we go along.</v>

913
00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:33.530
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

914
00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:37.730
<v Speaker 2>Dr. Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your lectures,</v>

915
00:53:37.731 --> 00:53:40.970
<v Speaker 2>you speak a lot about toughening people </v>
<v Speaker 2>up as someone who went through college,</v>

916
00:53:40.971 --> 00:53:41.804
<v Speaker 2>got a humanities degree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bought completely into postmodern </v>

917
00:53:44.061 --> 00:53:46.820
<v Speaker 2>ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And until hearing your lectures couldn't</v>

918
00:53:46.821 --> 00:53:48.830
<v Speaker 2>pawn pinpoint that feeling of </v>
<v Speaker 2>aimlessness,</v>

919
00:53:48.831 --> 00:53:51.230
<v Speaker 2>hopelessness and the aversion to </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility,</v>

920
00:53:51.350 --> 00:53:55.070
<v Speaker 2>where do you recommend they start?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've particularly seen this inability to</v>

921
00:53:55.071 --> 00:53:55.904
<v Speaker 2>be tough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to negotiate and to bring up my inner </v>

922
00:53:58.221 --> 00:54:01.640
<v Speaker 2>tyrant who is really just afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or You said it does bring out your inner</v>

923
00:54:01.641 --> 00:54:04.970
<v Speaker 2>tyrant who is really just afraid it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not going to get what it wants.</v>

924
00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:07.850
<v Speaker 2>How do you begin to work with that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

925
00:54:07.870 --> 00:54:09.140
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good question.</v>

926
00:54:09.770 --> 00:54:12.800
<v Speaker 2>And the next question is how can men </v>
<v Speaker 2>become more dangerous?</v>

927
00:54:12.830 --> 00:54:13.663
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can answer both of those at the same </v>

928
00:54:14.601 --> 00:54:15.434
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say for people who are too </v>

929
00:54:18.381 --> 00:54:19.214
<v Speaker 2>agreeable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first thing that you need to know </v>

930
00:54:22.110 --> 00:54:25.230
<v Speaker 2>what the first thing you need to figure </v>
<v Speaker 2>out is what is it that you want?</v>

931
00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:28.073
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

932
00:54:28.510 --> 00:54:29.343
<v Speaker 2>because if you don't want anything and </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't know what you want and you </v>

933
00:54:31.691 --> 00:54:32.524
<v Speaker 2>don't know what your strategy is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how are you ever going to be able to </v>

934
00:54:35.050 --> 00:54:37.750
<v Speaker 2>conjure up the courage to stand for what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you believe in?</v>

935
00:54:37.751 --> 00:54:41.110
<v Speaker 2>You don't believe in anything and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have any arguments at hand.</v>

936
00:54:41.410 --> 00:54:42.243
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's part of the reason that we </v>

937
00:54:42.821 --> 00:54:47.180
<v Speaker 2>developed the future authoring program </v>
<v Speaker 2>was so that people could not only figure</v>

938
00:54:47.181 --> 00:54:49.990
<v Speaker 2>out what they wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to identify the goals in life,</v>

939
00:54:49.991 --> 00:54:53.320
<v Speaker 2>which is identifying those goals as an </v>
<v Speaker 2>integrating force,</v>

940
00:54:53.740 --> 00:54:54.573
<v Speaker 2>but also to articulate the arguments </v>
<v Speaker 2>that make them capable of defending </v>

941
00:54:57.761 --> 00:54:58.421
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

942
00:54:58.421 --> 00:55:01.090
<v Speaker 2>like if I'm going to challenge you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say you come to me and you say,</v>

943
00:55:01.091 --> 00:55:02.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

944
00:55:03.070 --> 00:55:06.610
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to raise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's taken you a lot of courage to</v>

945
00:55:06.611 --> 00:55:07.760
<v Speaker 2>conjure to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

946
00:55:07.890 --> 00:55:10.930
<v Speaker 2>to be able to step into the office of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your boss and say,</v>

947
00:55:10.931 --> 00:55:12.250
<v Speaker 2>well I want to raise.</v>

948
00:55:12.730 --> 00:55:13.630
<v Speaker 2>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well no,</v>

949
00:55:13.631 --> 00:55:15.160
<v Speaker 2>we don't have any extra money at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

950
00:55:15.161 --> 00:55:16.630
<v Speaker 2>And you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well okay.</v>

951
00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:20.440
<v Speaker 2>And then you leave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's not a good negotiation.</v>

952
00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:24.430
<v Speaker 2>If you want something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first thing you have to do is set up</v>

953
00:55:24.431 --> 00:55:27.400
<v Speaker 2>options for yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you really want to negotiate for a</v>

954
00:55:27.401 --> 00:55:28.750
<v Speaker 2>raise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

955
00:55:28.840 --> 00:55:30.430
<v Speaker 2>cause it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll use this as an example.</v>

956
00:55:31.060 --> 00:55:31.893
<v Speaker 2>The first thing you have to do is decide</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether or not you deserve to have a </v>

957
00:55:34.061 --> 00:55:36.250
<v Speaker 2>race.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you can't just ask for one.</v>

958
00:55:36.251 --> 00:55:37.084
<v Speaker 2>You have to make a case for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so how do you know if you're in a </v>

959
00:55:40.541 --> 00:55:42.490
<v Speaker 2>position to ask for a raise?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

960
00:55:42.491 --> 00:55:43.324
<v Speaker 2>part of it is that you have options.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I would say put your cv or your </v>

961
00:55:47.831 --> 00:55:52.831
<v Speaker 2>resume in order and make it tight and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then look around to see what other other</v>

962
00:55:54.100 --> 00:55:54.933
<v Speaker 2>employment options you have that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>would in fact take and see what your </v>

963
00:55:58.541 --> 00:55:59.650
<v Speaker 2>market value is.</v>

964
00:55:59.830 --> 00:56:00.663
<v Speaker 2>And because you have to have options,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be able to say no one in </v>

965
00:56:03.071 --> 00:56:03.904
<v Speaker 2>negotiation and then decide how much of </v>
<v Speaker 2>a raise you want and why it would be in </v>

966
00:56:10.001 --> 00:56:12.550
<v Speaker 2>the person's best interest to offer you </v>
<v Speaker 2>the race,</v>

967
00:56:12.580 --> 00:56:14.560
<v Speaker 2>make a case for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one,</v>

968
00:56:14.590 --> 00:56:15.760
<v Speaker 2>one of the reasons is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

969
00:56:15.761 --> 00:56:19.750
<v Speaker 2>I've got this other job opportunity that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pursuing and I like working here,</v>

970
00:56:19.751 --> 00:56:22.510
<v Speaker 2>but I'm going to take this other </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity because it pays me more.</v>

971
00:56:23.050 --> 00:56:25.330
<v Speaker 2>And you can't just say that if it's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>the case,</v>

972
00:56:25.331 --> 00:56:26.164
<v Speaker 2>if it's not true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's an absolutely foolish </v>

973
00:56:27.641 --> 00:56:30.430
<v Speaker 2>negotiating strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to have options,</v>

974
00:56:30.431 --> 00:56:32.710
<v Speaker 2>you have to negotiate from a position of</v>
<v Speaker 2>strength.</v>

975
00:56:33.220 --> 00:56:36.640
<v Speaker 2>And so you have to know what you want </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you have to have options.</v>

976
00:56:36.641 --> 00:56:37.474
<v Speaker 2>And then you have to develop strategies </v>
<v Speaker 2>for communicating what it is that </v>

977
00:56:39.941 --> 00:56:42.590
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're asking for and you,</v>

978
00:56:42.630 --> 00:56:44.950
<v Speaker 2>you have to be forthright about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

979
00:56:44.980 --> 00:56:47.440
<v Speaker 2>but you have to think through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasons because otherwise you won't have</v>

980
00:56:47.441 --> 00:56:50.740
<v Speaker 2>enough courage to tolerate the conflict </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it might entail to,</v>

981
00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:53.380
<v Speaker 2>to withstand the negotiation.</v>

982
00:56:53.710 --> 00:56:57.310
<v Speaker 2>And I think if you're an agreeable type,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one way of,</v>

983
00:56:57.370 --> 00:56:58.390
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

984
00:56:58.780 --> 00:56:59.613
<v Speaker 2>of fortifying yourself is to understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>how much misery and conflict you may be </v>

985
00:57:03.431 --> 00:57:08.431
<v Speaker 2>storing up for yourself in the future if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you refuse or if you refuse to engage in</v>

986
00:57:08.861 --> 00:57:11.530
<v Speaker 2>reasonable negotiation on your own </v>
<v Speaker 2>behalf in the present.</v>

987
00:57:11.950 --> 00:57:15.460
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so one of the ways I get myself to do,</v>

988
00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:18.640
<v Speaker 2>to engage in conflict that I might not </v>
<v Speaker 2>have wanted to engage in.</v>

989
00:57:18.670 --> 00:57:19.503
<v Speaker 2>And despite what you might think because</v>
<v Speaker 2>of what's happened to me over the next </v>

990
00:57:21.671 --> 00:57:24.670
<v Speaker 2>six months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a person who particularly enjoys</v>

991
00:57:24.671 --> 00:57:25.504
<v Speaker 2>conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a person who knows that unless you </v>

992
00:57:28.151 --> 00:57:31.660
<v Speaker 2>engage in a certain amount of conflict </v>
<v Speaker 2>to stand up for what you want,</v>

993
00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:35.470
<v Speaker 2>that your life turns into hell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And maybe the lives of people around you</v>

994
00:57:35.471 --> 00:57:38.350
<v Speaker 2>turns into hell too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'd rather have the damn conflict,</v>

995
00:57:38.351 --> 00:57:39.700
<v Speaker 2>which I find quite stressful.</v>

996
00:57:40.150 --> 00:57:43.420
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather have the conflict and allow </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything to degenerate around me.</v>

997
00:57:44.080 --> 00:57:45.310
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

998
00:57:45.340 --> 00:57:46.173
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you say you bring out your </v>

999
00:57:48.641 --> 00:57:51.910
<v Speaker 2>inner tyrant who is really just afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to get what it wants.</v>

1000
00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:53.013
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get what you negotiate for and if </v>

1001
00:57:55.481 --> 00:57:58.600
<v Speaker 2>you put yourself in a position of power </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you give yourself options,</v>

1002
00:57:58.601 --> 00:58:01.390
<v Speaker 2>then you will get what you most more </v>
<v Speaker 2>frequently than not,</v>

1003
00:58:01.391 --> 00:58:03.400
<v Speaker 2>you'll get what it is that you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1004
00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:04.503
<v Speaker 2>but not because you want it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but because you have a variety of </v>

1005
00:58:07.811 --> 00:58:08.644
<v Speaker 2>options available to you that would </v>
<v Speaker 2>enable you to move forward more </v>

1006
00:58:11.261 --> 00:58:13.780
<v Speaker 2>effectively in life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1007
00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:19.800
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's see.</v>

1008
00:58:24.740 --> 00:58:28.940
<v Speaker 2>Note for Juliet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will this live stream be archived?</v>

1009
00:58:28.950 --> 00:58:30.090
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will be archived.</v>

1010
00:58:30.130 --> 00:58:32.070
<v Speaker 2>Our Youtube seems to do that </v>
<v Speaker 2>automatically.</v>

1011
00:58:32.850 --> 00:58:33.683
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1012
00:58:35.450 --> 00:58:37.910
<v Speaker 2>is this chat really just patrons?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1013
00:58:37.911 --> 00:58:39.170
<v Speaker 2>It's just patrons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1014
00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:40.353
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's reasonable for the people who are </v>

1015
00:58:41.961 --> 00:58:44.410
<v Speaker 2>supporting the channel to have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1016
00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:45.313
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to what it's reasonable for me to thank </v>

1017
00:58:48.351 --> 00:58:51.080
<v Speaker 2>the people that are supporting the </v>
<v Speaker 2>channel in a specific way.</v>

1018
00:58:51.710 --> 00:58:53.200
<v Speaker 2>I know that you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I,</v>

1019
00:58:53.320 --> 00:58:57.980
<v Speaker 2>I talked to a number of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are happy that your efforts are also</v>

1020
00:58:58.190 --> 00:59:01.010
<v Speaker 2>contributing to the fact that very many </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

1021
00:59:01.011 --> 00:59:01.844
<v Speaker 2>and it's about 8 million now by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very many people are able to watch </v>

1022
00:59:05.391 --> 00:59:06.224
<v Speaker 2>these lectures online and many people </v>
<v Speaker 2>are translating them and doing all of </v>

1023
00:59:08.901 --> 00:59:09.710
<v Speaker 2>that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1024
00:59:09.710 --> 00:59:10.543
<v Speaker 2>so the information that's available in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the lectures is spreading very rapidly </v>

1025
00:59:12.981 --> 00:59:13.814
<v Speaker 2>and the support that you've uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>provided me with has not only </v>

1026
00:59:18.770 --> 00:59:21.050
<v Speaker 2>facilitated that and improve the </v>
<v Speaker 2>quality,</v>

1027
00:59:21.620 --> 00:59:22.453
<v Speaker 2>these offerings substantially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but has also enabled me to start </v>

1028
00:59:25.161 --> 00:59:28.910
<v Speaker 2>thinking about what I might do in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>future that's more extensive.</v>

1029
00:59:29.660 --> 00:59:30.493
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so one of the things I thought I </v>

1030
00:59:35.001 --> 00:59:37.910
<v Speaker 2>would do is to thank the Patriot people </v>
<v Speaker 2>specifically for,</v>

1031
00:59:38.060 --> 00:59:40.580
<v Speaker 2>for devoting their resources to this </v>
<v Speaker 2>project.</v>

1032
00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:44.360
<v Speaker 2>And I doing the q and a's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do them once a month.</v>

1033
00:59:44.900 --> 00:59:45.860
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1034
00:59:46.630 --> 00:59:47.000
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1035
00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:47.833
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just Patriot on people who are </v>

1036
00:59:49.460 --> 00:59:51.830
<v Speaker 2>going to be able to submit the cue the </v>
<v Speaker 2>questions.</v>

1037
00:59:51.950 --> 00:59:55.040
<v Speaker 2>Although everybody will be able to watch</v>
<v Speaker 2>them on Youtube because why not?</v>

1038
00:59:55.300 --> 00:59:56.780
<v Speaker 2>It's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no harm done there.</v>

1039
00:59:56.781 --> 00:59:58.820
<v Speaker 2>And it's nothing but benefit as far as I</v>
<v Speaker 2>can tell.</v>

1040
00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:02.150
<v Speaker 2>So I'm Benjamin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rude says Jordan,</v>

1041
01:00:02.151 --> 01:00:04.640
<v Speaker 2>why don't you use a dedicated microphone</v>
<v Speaker 2>and headphones?</v>

1042
01:00:04.641 --> 01:00:08.360
<v Speaker 2>There is a painful reverb slash echo </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you interview host people.</v>

1043
01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:09.980
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I've taken care of that.</v>

1044
01:00:09.981 --> 01:00:14.000
<v Speaker 2>I've got a very good set of earbuds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got new lighting.</v>

1045
01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:15.073
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got to though I have a very good </v>

1046
01:00:16.761 --> 01:00:18.890
<v Speaker 2>microphone even though I wasn't using it</v>
<v Speaker 2>very well.</v>

1047
01:00:18.891 --> 01:00:19.724
<v Speaker 2>And so I think I probably got that </v>
<v Speaker 2>solved and certainly the camera is much </v>

1048
01:00:22.581 --> 01:00:24.680
<v Speaker 2>better than the one before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1049
01:00:24.830 --> 01:00:27.320
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's see,</v>

1050
01:00:27.350 --> 01:00:28.790
<v Speaker 2>what else have we got to say here?</v>

1051
01:00:34.370 --> 01:00:35.203
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1052
01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:49.413
<v Speaker 2>One of the things also that I might </v>
<v Speaker 2>comment on it that's quite interesting </v>

1053
01:00:52.001 --> 01:00:56.830
<v Speaker 2>is that I've read a lot of the youtube </v>
<v Speaker 2>comments that accompany my video isn't,</v>

1054
01:00:56.890 --> 01:00:57.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1055
01:00:57.700 --> 01:00:58.533
<v Speaker 2>most of the time my experience is on </v>
<v Speaker 2>youtube that if you read the youtube </v>

1056
01:01:01.061 --> 01:01:04.840
<v Speaker 2>comments gives you a seeking feeling </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the potential future of humanity.</v>

1057
01:01:05.230 --> 01:01:06.063
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1058
01:01:06.370 --> 01:01:07.203
<v Speaker 2>people seem to use the opportunity </v>
<v Speaker 2>provided by anonymity to be some </v>

1059
01:01:11.201 --> 01:01:12.034
<v Speaker 2>strange,</v>
<v Speaker 2>frequently some strange combination of </v>

1060
01:01:13.901 --> 01:01:16.600
<v Speaker 2>arrogant and obnoxious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1061
01:01:16.910 --> 01:01:18.310
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on balance.</v>

1062
01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:20.260
<v Speaker 2>And I would say it's more than on </v>
<v Speaker 2>balance.</v>

1063
01:01:20.261 --> 01:01:21.094
<v Speaker 2>It's in the vast majority of cases the </v>
<v Speaker 2>comments that have been appended to my </v>

1064
01:01:24.611 --> 01:01:27.430
<v Speaker 2>youtube videos apart from the odd troll </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1065
01:01:27.580 --> 01:01:30.910
<v Speaker 2>and the odd person making the sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>comments that no one should make,</v>

1066
01:01:31.330 --> 01:01:32.920
<v Speaker 2>the quality of the comments has been </v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

1067
01:01:32.921 --> 01:01:35.080
<v Speaker 2>very high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm very happy about that.</v>

1068
01:01:35.081 --> 01:01:38.140
<v Speaker 2>And maybe that's an accurate reflection </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the people that are,</v>

1069
01:01:38.230 --> 01:01:41.320
<v Speaker 2>are watching the information that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>provided by the videos.</v>

1070
01:01:41.321 --> 01:01:45.070
<v Speaker 2>It's rather difficult information and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't think it's particularly welcome to</v>

1071
01:01:45.071 --> 01:01:48.340
<v Speaker 2>those who only want to cause trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

1072
01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:54.240
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dr. Peterson,</v>

1073
01:01:54.251 --> 01:01:55.084
<v Speaker 2>I'm a psychology student.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think is the role of </v>

1074
01:01:57.281 --> 01:02:00.310
<v Speaker 2>psychology in the selective </v>
<v Speaker 2>reconstruction of ethics?</v>

1075
01:02:01.030 --> 01:02:01.863
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1076
01:02:03.090 --> 01:02:03.923
<v Speaker 2>I think that that's part of the reason </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I'm a great admirer of both Freud </v>

1077
01:02:06.781 --> 01:02:10.470
<v Speaker 2>and young and Rogers to that degree to </v>
<v Speaker 2>to some degree,</v>

1078
01:02:10.471 --> 01:02:11.304
<v Speaker 2>I know you don't and not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't only limit it to them </v>

1079
01:02:14.251 --> 01:02:17.250
<v Speaker 2>because I've learned a lot from reading </v>
<v Speaker 2>the great clinicians,</v>

1080
01:02:17.730 --> 01:02:18.563
<v Speaker 2>the great clinicians are attempting to </v>
<v Speaker 2>determine what the appropriate ethic is </v>

1081
01:02:23.731 --> 01:02:24.564
<v Speaker 2>that promotes both healthy lives and </v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy societies and they've made a </v>

1082
01:02:27.451 --> 01:02:28.950
<v Speaker 2>fair bit of progress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1083
01:02:28.951 --> 01:02:29.784
<v Speaker 2>and maybe this gives some credence to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sam Harris's claim that you can derive </v>

1084
01:02:33.391 --> 01:02:34.940
<v Speaker 2>an ought from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>An is a,</v>

1085
01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:39.510
<v Speaker 2>certainly an is can inform an art,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although it certainly doesn't,</v>

1086
01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:41.310
<v Speaker 2>there's too many is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to,</v>

1087
01:02:41.430 --> 01:02:44.520
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to derive arts with in,</v>

1088
01:02:44.610 --> 01:02:47.100
<v Speaker 2>in various,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the fundamental problem,</v>

1089
01:02:47.670 --> 01:02:50.520
<v Speaker 2>but it's certainly the case that one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the things,</v>

1090
01:02:50.550 --> 01:02:51.383
<v Speaker 2>the pieces of wisdom that you can see </v>
<v Speaker 2>emerge across psychotherapists is that </v>

1091
01:02:54.690 --> 01:02:55.523
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are strengthened by voluntary </v>

1092
01:02:57.001 --> 01:02:58.860
<v Speaker 2>exposure to the things that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>avoiding.</v>

1093
01:02:59.430 --> 01:03:00.263
<v Speaker 2>And that's a big deal because I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's not much different than a </v>

1094
01:03:03.511 --> 01:03:04.344
<v Speaker 2>practical application of the lessons </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are embodied in Orthodox </v>

1095
01:03:07.530 --> 01:03:12.530
<v Speaker 2>represented rep that are represented in </v>
<v Speaker 2>an image and drama in hero mythology.</v>

1096
01:03:12.811 --> 01:03:13.644
<v Speaker 2>Because the hero is the person who goes </v>
<v Speaker 2>forth to voluntarily confront the </v>

1097
01:03:16.441 --> 01:03:17.274
<v Speaker 2>unknown and gained something as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequence and benefits the community </v>

1098
01:03:20.910 --> 01:03:22.140
<v Speaker 2>as a consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1099
01:03:22.141 --> 01:03:22.974
<v Speaker 2>and that is very little different than </v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea of exposure therapy and </v>

1100
01:03:25.681 --> 01:03:29.250
<v Speaker 2>psychotherapy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that seems to me to be the base,</v>

1101
01:03:29.251 --> 01:03:30.084
<v Speaker 2>the core basis of a certain kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ethic is that human development is </v>

1102
01:03:33.001 --> 01:03:33.834
<v Speaker 2>facilitated by voluntary exploration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>confrontation and exploration of the </v>

1103
01:03:37.561 --> 01:03:38.394
<v Speaker 2>unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that looks something like it's all </v>

1104
01:03:40.770 --> 01:03:41.603
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if she can precisely say </v>

1105
01:03:42.571 --> 01:03:43.404
<v Speaker 2>that that's an ought from an is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's certainly 10 it's certainly </v>

1106
01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:47.213
<v Speaker 2>trending in that direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So psychologists can help us understand </v>

1107
01:03:51.990 --> 01:03:52.823
<v Speaker 2>the nature of human beings and by </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding the nature of human </v>

1108
01:03:55.171 --> 01:03:56.004
<v Speaker 2>beings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we may be able to better understand how </v>

1109
01:03:57.901 --> 01:04:00.390
<v Speaker 2>it is that human beings might optimally </v>
<v Speaker 2>behave.</v>

1110
01:04:00.990 --> 01:04:01.823
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that may also not merely be a </v>

1111
01:04:04.471 --> 01:04:09.471
<v Speaker 2>consequence of laying out the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the vast array of empirical facts that's</v>

1112
01:04:11.491 --> 01:04:13.650
<v Speaker 2>associated with psychological </v>
<v Speaker 2>investigation.</v>

1113
01:04:13.651 --> 01:04:14.484
<v Speaker 2>It might also be a consequence of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sorts of things that piaget talked </v>

1114
01:04:18.121 --> 01:04:18.954
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the observation of how </v>

1115
01:04:20.521 --> 01:04:21.354
<v Speaker 2>societies right from the small societies</v>
<v Speaker 2>of childhood all the way up organize </v>

1116
01:04:26.581 --> 01:04:30.060
<v Speaker 2>themselves into coherent and functional </v>
<v Speaker 2>large scale units.</v>

1117
01:04:30.510 --> 01:04:31.343
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1118
01:04:34.910 --> 01:04:35.743
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you walk the line between being </v>

1119
01:04:45.591 --> 01:04:48.380
<v Speaker 2>too agreeable or disagreeable when in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship,</v>

1120
01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:49.633
<v Speaker 2>not making it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not making it boring or impossible to </v>

1121
01:04:51.501 --> 01:04:53.360
<v Speaker 2>work with the other person?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1122
01:04:53.361 --> 01:04:54.194
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you walk the line between being too </v>

1123
01:04:55.671 --> 01:05:00.671
<v Speaker 2>agreeable or disagreeable by self </v>
<v Speaker 2>reflection at by self reflection,</v>

1124
01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:07.240
<v Speaker 2>listening and negotiation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the self reflection is um,</v>

1125
01:05:10.750 --> 01:05:13.420
<v Speaker 2>continual self analysis about whether or</v>
<v Speaker 2>not you,</v>

1126
01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:14.313
<v Speaker 2>the relationship is fulfilling those </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that you need to be fulfilled in </v>

1127
01:05:17.230 --> 01:05:19.360
<v Speaker 2>to commit to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1128
01:05:19.361 --> 01:05:20.194
<v Speaker 2>self reflection is continuing analysis </v>
<v Speaker 2>of whether you're acting in the other </v>

1129
01:05:23.651 --> 01:05:24.484
<v Speaker 2>person's best interest in a way that </v>
<v Speaker 2>facilitates your own interest in a </v>

1130
01:05:27.611 --> 01:05:28.444
<v Speaker 2>manner that makes the relationship </v>
<v Speaker 2>likely to last and maybe to extend out </v>

1131
01:05:31.391 --> 01:05:35.980
<v Speaker 2>beneficial beneficial consequences into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the broader community.</v>

1132
01:05:36.730 --> 01:05:37.563
<v Speaker 2>And then less by listening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get a chance to see how the other </v>

1133
01:05:40.271 --> 01:05:43.930
<v Speaker 2>person views the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by negotiating you enjoy,</v>

1134
01:05:43.990 --> 01:05:48.990
<v Speaker 2>you engage in joint problem solving and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the person will tell you often if you're</v>

1135
01:05:49.151 --> 01:05:50.590
<v Speaker 2>being a pushover,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1136
01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:54.010
<v Speaker 2>you never tell me what you want to do it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1137
01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:54.873
<v Speaker 2>and then you get angry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That that's often an indication that </v>

1138
01:05:57.011 --> 01:05:57.844
<v Speaker 2>you're being a pushover or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or maybe you don't take enough during </v>

1139
01:06:01.181 --> 01:06:02.014
<v Speaker 2>sex or maybe you give,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you give too much or you don't take </v>

1140
01:06:04.691 --> 01:06:05.524
<v Speaker 2>enough during sex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is actually quite frustrating for </v>

1141
01:06:07.001 --> 01:06:10.270
<v Speaker 2>the other person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's self reflection,</v>

1142
01:06:10.690 --> 01:06:14.530
<v Speaker 2>listening and negotiation that that'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>help.</v>

1143
01:06:14.590 --> 01:06:16.360
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's basically the,</v>

1144
01:06:16.990 --> 01:06:18.220
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1145
01:06:18.430 --> 01:06:20.920
<v Speaker 2>short and straight forward answer to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1146
01:06:21.660 --> 01:06:22.493
<v Speaker 1>MMM.</v>

1147
01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:31.580
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's see here.</v>

1148
01:06:33.810 --> 01:06:35.670
<v Speaker 2>Somebody said that Julian is cute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1149
01:06:35.671 --> 01:06:37.800
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell him that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure he'll be happy to hear that.</v>

1150
01:06:37.801 --> 01:06:38.634
<v Speaker 2>I think he's cute too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although he's 25 year old man and he's </v>

1151
01:06:41.071 --> 01:06:44.250
<v Speaker 2>not necessarily all that thrilled when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>refer to him as cute.</v>

1152
01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:48.420
<v Speaker 2>He's actually quite tough and that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think is actually tough plus cute.</v>

1153
01:06:48.421 --> 01:06:50.760
<v Speaker 2>That's a killer combination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1154
01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:54.753
<v Speaker 2>Elvin artists says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love your serious tone when answering </v>

1155
01:06:57.431 --> 01:06:58.450
<v Speaker 2>dumb questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1156
01:06:58.451 --> 01:07:01.510
<v Speaker 2>thank you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate the positive feedback.</v>

1157
01:07:01.511 --> 01:07:02.344
<v Speaker 2>It's how tall and my Dr. Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It depends on whether I'm sitting down </v>

1158
01:07:05.171 --> 01:07:06.004
<v Speaker 2>or standing up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So at the moment I'm about three foot </v>

1159
01:07:08.201 --> 01:07:09.700
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but generally speaking,</v>

1160
01:07:09.701 --> 01:07:11.770
<v Speaker 2>if I'm standing up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm about six foot one.</v>

1161
01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:13.113
<v Speaker 2>So you could ask me some more questions </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that because it's getting late at </v>

1162
01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:17.373
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so those questions are really easy </v>

1163
01:07:18.490 --> 01:07:19.323
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1164
01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:21.910
<v Speaker 2>to answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone says,</v>

1165
01:07:21.911 --> 01:07:24.310
<v Speaker 2>my father is dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who Do I save from the whale?</v>

1166
01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:25.031
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's easy.</v>

1167
01:07:25.031 --> 01:07:27.190
<v Speaker 2>You save your spiritual father from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whale.</v>

1168
01:07:27.870 --> 01:07:30.310
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>saunder behind her sis.</v>

1169
01:07:30.311 --> 01:07:32.020
<v Speaker 2>My feet lost weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1170
01:07:32.140 --> 01:07:34.900
<v Speaker 2>possibly I haven't weighed them </v>
<v Speaker 2>independently of my body,</v>

1171
01:07:35.110 --> 01:07:36.850
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is certainly possible.</v>

1172
01:07:37.380 --> 01:07:38.213
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chinese culture mansplain says plus one </v>

1173
01:07:41.111 --> 01:07:42.130
<v Speaker 2>for Paleo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1174
01:07:42.550 --> 01:07:43.383
<v Speaker 2>I know a number of people who have </v>
<v Speaker 2>benefited substantially from a Paleo </v>

1175
01:07:46.061 --> 01:07:47.140
<v Speaker 2>Diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including,</v>

1176
01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:48.033
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a relative of mine who's a great genius </v>

1177
01:07:49.961 --> 01:07:52.690
<v Speaker 2>and whose life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whose probably in better shape,</v>

1178
01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:53.733
<v Speaker 2>better shape.</v>

1179
01:07:53.830 --> 01:07:55.780
<v Speaker 2>Now that he's 60,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then he was,</v>

1180
01:07:55.781 --> 01:07:56.614
<v Speaker 2>when he was 45,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he made very radical dietary </v>

1181
01:07:59.530 --> 01:08:00.363
<v Speaker 2>transformations of approximately the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same sort that I've made in my keys in </v>

1182
01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:06.970
<v Speaker 2>extremely good physical shape and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and doing very well mentally.</v>

1183
01:08:06.971 --> 01:08:07.804
<v Speaker 2>And so there is a lot more to the Diet </v>
<v Speaker 2>picture then we know and at least for </v>

1184
01:08:11.621 --> 01:08:12.454
<v Speaker 2>some people a heavy carbohydrate diet </v>
<v Speaker 2>seems to be absolutely catastrophic and </v>

1185
01:08:16.401 --> 01:08:17.234
<v Speaker 2>it's something I wouldn't have expected </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm one of those people who </v>

1186
01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:23.030
<v Speaker 2>regarded people who was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who were hyper concerned with their diet</v>

1187
01:08:23.031 --> 01:08:23.864
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>

1188
01:08:23.930 --> 01:08:26.240
<v Speaker 2>as tending towards the unbearably </v>
<v Speaker 2>neurotic.</v>

1189
01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:28.730
<v Speaker 2>And I certainly learned my lesson about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1190
01:08:28.870 --> 01:08:32.900
<v Speaker 2>I no doubt in any group of people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>are hyper concerned about something,</v>

1191
01:08:32.901 --> 01:08:35.000
<v Speaker 2>there are people who are unnecessarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>concerned,</v>

1192
01:08:35.001 --> 01:08:38.570
<v Speaker 2>but there's definitely something going </v>
<v Speaker 2>on with our diets,</v>

1193
01:08:39.170 --> 01:08:40.003
<v Speaker 2>especially in North America because </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone is overweight and far too many </v>

1194
01:08:43.011 --> 01:08:44.510
<v Speaker 2>people are depressed.</v>

1195
01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:45.873
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I do think that it has something to </v>

1196
01:08:47.541 --> 01:08:49.130
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hesitate to say this,</v>

1197
01:08:49.131 --> 01:08:49.964
<v Speaker 2>but I do think that it has something to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do with eating too much green derived </v>

1198
01:08:54.701 --> 01:08:58.610
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>specifically perhaps wheat and dairy.</v>

1199
01:08:59.420 --> 01:09:01.270
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's there,</v>

1200
01:09:01.290 --> 01:09:02.123
<v Speaker 2>the situation may be more complicated </v>
<v Speaker 2>than that and it's not an area of </v>

1201
01:09:04.881 --> 01:09:05.714
<v Speaker 2>specific expertise for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm hesitant to say anything more </v>

1202
01:09:09.051 --> 01:09:09.884
<v Speaker 2>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Robby Kelly says storing is from </v>

1203
01:09:12.201 --> 01:09:13.034
<v Speaker 2>being overweight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sleep paralysis stops muscles in the </v>

1204
01:09:14.901 --> 01:09:17.270
<v Speaker 2>throat from keeping the fat away from </v>
<v Speaker 2>crushing windpipe.</v>

1205
01:09:17.510 --> 01:09:17.961
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1206
01:09:17.961 --> 01:09:19.910
<v Speaker 2>I thought that too when I stopped </v>
<v Speaker 2>snoring.</v>

1207
01:09:19.911 --> 01:09:24.500
<v Speaker 2>But the thing is after I changed my diet</v>
<v Speaker 2>to basically a paleo diet,</v>

1208
01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:25.753
<v Speaker 2>I stopped snoring within a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It happened long before I lost enough </v>

1209
01:09:28.731 --> 01:09:30.560
<v Speaker 2>weight to make that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that canonical reason.</v>

1210
01:09:30.950 --> 01:09:31.783
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1211
01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:37.240
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see.</v>

1212
01:09:38.250 --> 01:09:39.083
<v Speaker 2>A commenter says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paleo meat plus vegetables did great </v>

1213
01:09:41.131 --> 01:09:43.440
<v Speaker 2>things for my depression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>weight and health in general.</v>

1214
01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:43.981
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1215
01:09:43.981 --> 01:09:44.880
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is,</v>

1216
01:09:44.910 --> 01:09:45.850
<v Speaker 2>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1217
01:09:46.370 --> 01:09:47.203
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is something that's characteristic </v>

1218
01:09:49.441 --> 01:09:50.274
<v Speaker 2>of many people's experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Loser lesser 55 says his snoring a bad </v>

1219
01:09:54.361 --> 01:09:55.350
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1220
01:09:55.410 --> 01:09:56.243
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not if you enjoy it and not if you're </v>

1221
01:09:57.180 --> 01:09:58.950
<v Speaker 2>partner enjoys it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yes,</v>

1222
01:09:58.951 --> 01:09:59.784
<v Speaker 2>generally it's a bad thing because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>interferes with your sleep and anything </v>

1223
01:10:03.361 --> 01:10:06.200
<v Speaker 2>that interferes with your sleep is </v>
<v Speaker 2>generally a bad thing I get.</v>

1224
01:10:06.210 --> 01:10:07.043
<v Speaker 2>And it can devolve into sleep apnea </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you spend substantial periods of </v>

1225
01:10:10.141 --> 01:10:13.340
<v Speaker 2>time each night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not breathing and uh,</v>

1226
01:10:13.350 --> 01:10:15.300
<v Speaker 2>that can cause very serious health </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems.</v>

1227
01:10:15.301 --> 01:10:16.134
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1228
01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:17.520
<v Speaker 2>so yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can be,</v>

1229
01:10:17.550 --> 01:10:18.383
<v Speaker 2>it generally snoring is a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what would you recommend to someone </v>

1230
01:10:22.561 --> 01:10:23.394
<v Speaker 2>who wants to try to be productive in </v>
<v Speaker 2>their free time but always gets sucked </v>

1231
01:10:26.191 --> 01:10:28.650
<v Speaker 2>in by video games and other </v>
<v Speaker 2>distractions?</v>

1232
01:10:29.250 --> 01:10:32.370
<v Speaker 2>While I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>define more carefully,</v>

1233
01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:35.970
<v Speaker 2>precisely what you mean by productive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So get,</v>

1234
01:10:35.971 --> 01:10:36.804
<v Speaker 2>get a plan in order,</v>
<v Speaker 2>delineate the plan down to the level of </v>

1235
01:10:40.111 --> 01:10:43.260
<v Speaker 2>a daily routine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Set up a daily routine,</v>

1236
01:10:43.261 --> 01:10:44.094
<v Speaker 2>using a calendar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put in times that you're going to get </v>

1237
01:10:47.191 --> 01:10:51.000
<v Speaker 2>sucked in by video games and other </v>
<v Speaker 2>distractions because obviously you enjoy</v>

1238
01:10:51.001 --> 01:10:51.834
<v Speaker 2>that and then set yourself up so that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's difficult to get access to those </v>

1239
01:10:56.161 --> 01:10:56.994
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1240
01:10:57.250 --> 01:10:58.083
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1241
01:10:59.940 --> 01:11:01.380
<v Speaker 2>that's the answer to that question.</v>

1242
01:11:13.250 --> 01:11:13.860
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1243
01:11:13.860 --> 01:11:15.300
<v Speaker 2>More technical trouble here.</v>

1244
01:11:16.870 --> 01:11:17.770
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of that,</v>

1245
01:11:23.110 --> 01:11:24.880
<v Speaker 2>why in the world do you think it's doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

1246
01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:29.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So technological mysteries.</v>

1247
01:11:29.770 --> 01:11:32.950
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1248
01:11:34.810 --> 01:11:37.510
<v Speaker 2>let's see here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Congratulations on the socks,</v>

1249
01:11:37.511 --> 01:11:39.790
<v Speaker 2>the weight loss and better sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stay healthy.</v>

1250
01:11:39.791 --> 01:11:40.571
<v Speaker 2>We need you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1251
01:11:40.571 --> 01:11:41.404
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing my best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had a lot of health problems over </v>

1252
01:11:42.971 --> 01:11:43.804
<v Speaker 2>the last,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I guess to some degree over the </v>

1253
01:11:45.791 --> 01:11:49.600
<v Speaker 2>course of my entire life though I had a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very terrible time in December,</v>

1254
01:11:50.380 --> 01:11:55.060
<v Speaker 2>but I think I'm doing okay and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think the health problems were a</v>

1255
01:11:55.061 --> 01:11:57.430
<v Speaker 2>consequence of all the political </v>
<v Speaker 2>controversy that I'd be in.</v>

1256
01:11:57.431 --> 01:12:00.910
<v Speaker 2>I just think they happened to Cole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although one probably didn't really help</v>

1257
01:12:00.911 --> 01:12:02.380
<v Speaker 2>the other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1258
01:12:06.700 --> 01:12:07.533
<v Speaker 2>all right.</v>

1259
01:12:09.860 --> 01:12:12.890
<v Speaker 2>Hey Julian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Julian,</v>

1260
01:12:14.450 --> 01:12:17.400
<v Speaker 2>someone thinks that your cute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1261
01:12:17.610 --> 01:12:19.290
<v Speaker 2>someone thinks you're cute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1262
01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:20.183
<v Speaker 2>you want to come and look at these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people and they can judge for </v>

1263
01:12:21.801 --> 01:12:22.670
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1264
01:12:22.671 --> 01:12:23.190
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why not?</v>

1265
01:12:23.190 --> 01:12:24.770
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is Julian.</v>

1266
01:12:24.940 --> 01:12:26.120
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's my son.</v>

1267
01:12:26.121 --> 01:12:29.160
<v Speaker 2>He's been helping me with all of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>technical issues that,</v>

1268
01:12:29.230 --> 01:12:32.750
<v Speaker 2>that I've been coming up against or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>last few months.</v>

1269
01:12:32.751 --> 01:12:35.120
<v Speaker 2>And so he wouldn't think I was cute if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you knew me.</v>

1270
01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:37.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's exactly right.</v>

1271
01:12:37.491 --> 01:12:40.640
<v Speaker 2>So I think actually if you know anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you pretty much stopped thinking they're</v>

1272
01:12:40.641 --> 01:12:42.780
<v Speaker 2>cute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

1273
01:12:42.781 --> 01:12:44.960
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

1274
01:12:44.961 --> 01:12:46.400
<v Speaker 2>so let's see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what else have we got here?</v>

1275
01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:50.630
<v Speaker 2>What type of therapy should I seek for </v>
<v Speaker 2>my social anxiety with so many different</v>

1276
01:12:50.631 --> 01:12:52.050
<v Speaker 2>options available?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1277
01:12:52.460 --> 01:12:53.293
<v Speaker 2>I would say the most straight forward </v>
<v Speaker 2>form of therapy for something like </v>

1278
01:12:56.451 --> 01:12:57.284
<v Speaker 2>social anxiety is behavioral therapy and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the behavioral therapists are very </v>

1279
01:12:59.931 --> 01:13:00.530
<v Speaker 2>practical.</v>

1280
01:13:00.530 --> 01:13:02.480
<v Speaker 2>And so if it's relatively straight </v>
<v Speaker 2>forward,</v>

1281
01:13:02.481 --> 01:13:04.280
<v Speaker 2>social anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1282
01:13:04.310 --> 01:13:06.890
<v Speaker 2>exposure therapy is very useful for that</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of thing.</v>

1283
01:13:06.891 --> 01:13:09.820
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes social skills training,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't feel that you have the,</v>

1284
01:13:10.140 --> 01:13:10.973
<v Speaker 2>the like the skill and wherewithal to </v>
<v Speaker 2>conduct yourself appropriately in a </v>

1285
01:13:13.731 --> 01:13:15.710
<v Speaker 2>social environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And some people aren't,</v>

1286
01:13:15.711 --> 01:13:18.650
<v Speaker 2>weren't socialized very well and so they</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have those skills or they didn't,</v>

1287
01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:20.870
<v Speaker 2>they didn't get the opportunity to </v>
<v Speaker 2>practice.</v>

1288
01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:22.033
<v Speaker 2>I would say what's probably more </v>
<v Speaker 2>important is that you find a therapist </v>

1289
01:13:24.171 --> 01:13:25.004
<v Speaker 2>that you're comfortable with and who is </v>
<v Speaker 2>pushing you and helping you and </v>

1290
01:13:28.491 --> 01:13:32.030
<v Speaker 2>listening to you in a proper manner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But behavioral therapy is very,</v>

1291
01:13:32.031 --> 01:13:37.031
<v Speaker 2>very effective for relatively straight </v>
<v Speaker 2>forward ils issues of anxiety and um,</v>

1292
01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:40.490
<v Speaker 2>and skill deficit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>

1293
01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:43.270
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1294
01:13:43.370 --> 01:13:44.510
<v Speaker 2>What else have we got here?</v>

1295
01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:53.033
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1296
01:13:54.410 --> 01:13:58.700
<v Speaker 2>Do you think science is a different </v>
<v Speaker 2>domain then spirituality or religion and</v>

1297
01:13:58.701 --> 01:14:00.910
<v Speaker 2>therefore can't answer questions each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other's domain?</v>

1298
01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:01.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

1299
01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:02.233
<v Speaker 2>I do essentially believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that science is pretty good at </v>

1300
01:14:05.031 --> 01:14:05.864
<v Speaker 2>laying out the landscape of empirical </v>
<v Speaker 2>facts and that the religious is the </v>

1301
01:14:12.131 --> 01:14:14.620
<v Speaker 2>domain that attempts to answer the </v>
<v Speaker 2>question,</v>

1302
01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:15.633
<v Speaker 2>how is it that we should act in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world and there's overlap between the </v>

1303
01:14:19.001 --> 01:14:21.130
<v Speaker 2>two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't be entirely separate domains,</v>

1304
01:14:21.131 --> 01:14:21.964
<v Speaker 2>but roughly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the distinction and I think the </v>

1305
01:14:24.071 --> 01:14:28.810
<v Speaker 2>reason is is that value free empirical </v>
<v Speaker 2>facts cannot.</v>

1306
01:14:28.870 --> 01:14:33.640
<v Speaker 2>You cannot derive values from a set of </v>
<v Speaker 2>value free empirical facts and empirical</v>

1307
01:14:33.641 --> 01:14:34.474
<v Speaker 2>facts by their nature are value free,</v>
<v Speaker 2>partly because the value is eradicated </v>

1308
01:14:38.831 --> 01:14:41.380
<v Speaker 2>from the empirical fact by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientific method.</v>

1309
01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:43.870
<v Speaker 2>That's actually what the scientific </v>
<v Speaker 2>method does.</v>

1310
01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:45.033
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It cannot do it completely because </v>

1311
01:14:46.060 --> 01:14:46.893
<v Speaker 2>scientists tend to concentrate on facts </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they assume are relevant to the </v>

1312
01:14:50.921 --> 01:14:52.300
<v Speaker 2>solution of a given problem.</v>

1313
01:14:52.510 --> 01:14:53.343
<v Speaker 2>They don't just randomly search for </v>
<v Speaker 2>facts and that's a good thing because </v>

1314
01:14:55.901 --> 01:14:56.734
<v Speaker 2>there's an infinite number of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>irrelevant facts to get separate them </v>

1315
01:14:59.261 --> 01:15:01.160
<v Speaker 2>completely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that the,</v>

1316
01:15:01.170 --> 01:15:02.003
<v Speaker 2>some domains are separate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that the scientific domain is </v>

1317
01:15:04.061 --> 01:15:08.320
<v Speaker 2>necessarily nested inside the </v>
<v Speaker 2>metaphysically religious domain.</v>

1318
01:15:08.321 --> 01:15:09.154
<v Speaker 2>And I believe that that domain is </v>
<v Speaker 2>isomorphic in some sense with the </v>

1319
01:15:11.591 --> 01:15:12.424
<v Speaker 2>Darwinian domain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the point I was trying to </v>

1320
01:15:13.961 --> 01:15:16.360
<v Speaker 2>make in the discussions I had with Sam </v>
<v Speaker 2>Harris.</v>

1321
01:15:16.630 --> 01:15:18.310
<v Speaker 2>I have a lecture about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tom,</v>

1322
01:15:18.580 --> 01:15:22.180
<v Speaker 2>the name of which I don't precisely </v>
<v Speaker 2>remember unfortunately at the moment,</v>

1323
01:15:22.210 --> 01:15:27.130
<v Speaker 2>but it's a lecture on Darwinian versus </v>
<v Speaker 2>Newtonian approaches to the truth.</v>

1324
01:15:27.330 --> 01:15:31.210
<v Speaker 2>And I tried to delineate my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my thoughts about that more particularly</v>

1325
01:15:31.990 --> 01:15:33.670
<v Speaker 2>in that video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1326
01:15:36.110 --> 01:15:40.430
<v Speaker 2>how old was I when everything you </v>
<v Speaker 2>understood started to come together?</v>

1327
01:15:41.390 --> 01:15:44.240
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that really started happening to</v>

1328
01:15:44.241 --> 01:15:45.074
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

1329
01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:50.390
<v Speaker 2>started probably happening to me when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was in my early twenties.</v>

1330
01:15:50.570 --> 01:15:53.930
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the most important realization I</v>

1331
01:15:53.931 --> 01:15:54.764
<v Speaker 2>had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I outlined this realization in my </v>

1332
01:15:57.621 --> 01:15:59.690
<v Speaker 2>book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the preface of my book maps,</v>

1333
01:15:59.750 --> 01:16:00.583
<v Speaker 2>maps of meaning that I realized at about</v>
<v Speaker 2>that age that almost everything I said </v>

1334
01:16:05.421 --> 01:16:06.254
<v Speaker 2>was a false set of one form or another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was either I was using language </v>

1335
01:16:11.060 --> 01:16:11.893
<v Speaker 2>instrumentally in order to win arguments</v>
<v Speaker 2>or to attain dominance or to indicate </v>

1336
01:16:15.741 --> 01:16:19.640
<v Speaker 2>that I was intelligent or to use it for </v>
<v Speaker 2>victory,</v>

1337
01:16:19.641 --> 01:16:20.390
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

1338
01:16:20.390 --> 01:16:21.223
<v Speaker 2>for narrow local personal victory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I realized that when I was in my </v>

1339
01:16:27.020 --> 01:16:27.853
<v Speaker 2>early twenties and I started to cause a </v>
<v Speaker 2>voice in some sense of voice started </v>

1340
01:16:30.561 --> 01:16:31.394
<v Speaker 2>inside my head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I now regard as something </v>

1341
01:16:33.111 --> 01:16:36.620
<v Speaker 2>equivalent to the cricket in Pinocchio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it basically continued,</v>

1342
01:16:36.710 --> 01:16:41.710
<v Speaker 2>continually informed me that the things </v>
<v Speaker 2>I was saying weren't in some fundamental</v>

1343
01:16:41.901 --> 01:16:42.950
<v Speaker 2>sense weren't true.</v>

1344
01:16:42.950 --> 01:16:43.783
<v Speaker 2>And it was very disquieting because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>voice that was commenting on what I was </v>

1345
01:16:48.291 --> 01:16:53.291
<v Speaker 2>saying was making comments of that sort.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't call him disparaging act,</v>

1346
01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:57.490
<v Speaker 2>our voices of voice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was more just a,</v>

1347
01:16:58.100 --> 01:16:58.933
<v Speaker 2>a matter of fact commentary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was saying it about about 95% of </v>

1348
01:17:02.901 --> 01:17:04.250
<v Speaker 2>what I was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I thought,</v>

1349
01:17:04.251 --> 01:17:06.260
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a strange conundrum because now I</v>

1350
01:17:06.261 --> 01:17:07.094
<v Speaker 2>don't know if I'm the voice that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>criticizing what I'm saying or if I'm </v>

1351
01:17:10.641 --> 01:17:12.770
<v Speaker 2>the thing that's saying what's being </v>
<v Speaker 2>criticized,</v>

1352
01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:16.400
<v Speaker 2>how do you figure that out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I decided that I would take a chance</v>

1353
01:17:16.401 --> 01:17:17.234
<v Speaker 2>and assumed that the part that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>suggesting that I wasn't saying things </v>

1354
01:17:20.811 --> 01:17:21.644
<v Speaker 2>truthfully was accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I started to practice only saying </v>

1355
01:17:24.681 --> 01:17:27.090
<v Speaker 2>things that that voice wouldn't object </v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

1356
01:17:27.410 --> 01:17:28.243
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's also equivalent to </v>
<v Speaker 2>some degree to trying to say only those </v>

1357
01:17:31.191 --> 01:17:34.760
<v Speaker 2>things that make you strong instead of </v>
<v Speaker 2>weak or that make you,</v>

1358
01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:35.913
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that do not fill you with a post speech </v>

1359
01:17:37.971 --> 01:17:39.890
<v Speaker 2>sense of shame and regret.</v>

1360
01:17:40.460 --> 01:17:42.200
<v Speaker 2>And I really think that was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>beginning of,</v>

1361
01:17:42.201 --> 01:17:43.710
<v Speaker 2>of all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1362
01:17:43.790 --> 01:17:44.623
<v Speaker 2>about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was at the same time though that I </v>

1363
01:17:45.831 --> 01:17:49.550
<v Speaker 2>was starting to work out to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are starting to work on the problem that</v>

1364
01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:51.860
<v Speaker 2>I think is obsessed my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my entire life,</v>

1365
01:17:51.861 --> 01:17:56.780
<v Speaker 2>which is what's the pathway between </v>
<v Speaker 2>nihilism and totalitarianism?</v>

1366
01:17:57.020 --> 01:18:00.260
<v Speaker 2>Is there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there a genuine pathway between those</v>

1367
01:18:00.261 --> 01:18:02.780
<v Speaker 2>two pathological extremes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1368
01:18:02.781 --> 01:18:03.614
<v Speaker 2>and I think those things wove together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a serious problem to solve and I </v>

1369
01:18:06.951 --> 01:18:07.784
<v Speaker 2>also tried to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tried to begin to sort out my language </v>

1370
01:18:09.980 --> 01:18:12.710
<v Speaker 2>and really to learn how to work as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1371
01:18:12.711 --> 01:18:14.880
<v Speaker 2>and that was in my early twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1372
01:18:14.990 --> 01:18:17.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean I had lots of things to </v>
<v Speaker 2>straighten out in my life.</v>

1373
01:18:17.870 --> 01:18:18.770
<v Speaker 2>Many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many things.</v>

1374
01:18:18.771 --> 01:18:20.960
<v Speaker 2>And I still have many things to </v>
<v Speaker 2>straighten out in my life,</v>

1375
01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:24.530
<v Speaker 2>but I think that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1376
01:18:26.770 --> 01:18:27.603
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1377
01:18:39.610 --> 01:18:40.443
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But isn't the future authoring program </v>

1378
01:18:41.741 --> 01:18:43.720
<v Speaker 2>just praying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

1379
01:18:43.750 --> 01:18:45.220
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1380
01:18:45.221 --> 01:18:48.970
<v Speaker 2>whenever you ask a question and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>question is of the form,</v>

1381
01:18:49.060 --> 01:18:53.140
<v Speaker 2>is x equal to y?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The answer is always,</v>

1382
01:18:53.230 --> 01:18:56.980
<v Speaker 2>it depends on how you define x.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it depends on how you define why and</v>

1383
01:18:57.020 --> 01:18:58.930
<v Speaker 2>it's not a copout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1384
01:18:59.110 --> 01:19:00.820
<v Speaker 2>your question really means something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1385
01:19:00.821 --> 01:19:01.654
<v Speaker 2>are there important similarities between</v>
<v Speaker 2>what people conventionally described as </v>

1386
01:19:06.251 --> 01:19:07.084
<v Speaker 2>prayer and the meditative exercise that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you might undertake while doing the </v>

1387
01:19:09.941 --> 01:19:11.260
<v Speaker 2>future authoring?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would say yes,</v>

1388
01:19:11.261 --> 01:19:12.094
<v Speaker 2>there are important similarities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's reasonable to say </v>

1389
01:19:14.741 --> 01:19:15.574
<v Speaker 2>that they're the same because people </v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't automatically assume that they </v>

1390
01:19:17.861 --> 01:19:18.694
<v Speaker 2>were the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not obviously in the same </v>

1391
01:19:19.811 --> 01:19:20.644
<v Speaker 2>category.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I would say that completing the </v>

1392
01:19:23.201 --> 01:19:26.560
<v Speaker 2>future authoring exercise is to a large </v>
<v Speaker 2>degree,</v>

1393
01:19:27.110 --> 01:19:27.943
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>putting into practice in a very </v>

1394
01:19:29.711 --> 01:19:30.544
<v Speaker 2>pragmatic way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ethical guidelines that were </v>

1395
01:19:32.861 --> 01:19:33.694
<v Speaker 2>outlined in the sermon on the mount.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because what the sermon on the mount </v>

1396
01:19:35.771 --> 01:19:36.604
<v Speaker 2>basically says is something like aim at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the highest good that you can conceive </v>

1397
01:19:39.971 --> 01:19:43.780
<v Speaker 2>of and then concentrate on the day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that.</v>

1398
01:19:43.781 --> 01:19:47.170
<v Speaker 2>And there's also a tremendous call to </v>
<v Speaker 2>truth in that sermon.</v>

1399
01:19:47.171 --> 01:19:48.700
<v Speaker 2>So yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1400
01:19:50.260 --> 01:19:53.710
<v Speaker 2>Sam Dogan asks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is my favorite biblical story?</v>

1401
01:19:55.640 --> 01:19:57.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I have a favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1402
01:19:57.201 --> 01:19:59.270
<v Speaker 2>some of them I've analyzed more than </v>
<v Speaker 2>others.</v>

1403
01:19:59.271 --> 01:20:01.630
<v Speaker 2>I guess maybe that's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe the story that,</v>

1404
01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:02.633
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1405
01:20:03.090 --> 01:20:07.400
<v Speaker 2>that</v>
<v Speaker 2>packs the most punch for unitive of,</v>

1406
01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:08.490
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

1407
01:20:10.290 --> 01:20:11.123
<v Speaker 2>of conceptual effort</v>
<v Speaker 2>per unit of conceptual effort is the </v>

1408
01:20:15.061 --> 01:20:17.430
<v Speaker 2>story of Cain and Abel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is really quite a story.</v>

1409
01:20:17.790 --> 01:20:19.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very,</v>

1410
01:20:19.081 --> 01:20:23.340
<v Speaker 2>very short and it's unbelievably punchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1411
01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:29.190
<v Speaker 2>so far that's the one that's been most </v>
<v Speaker 2>remarkably illuminating to me.</v>

1412
01:20:29.370 --> 01:20:31.190
<v Speaker 2>Now that's not it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a tough,</v>

1413
01:20:31.220 --> 01:20:32.053
<v Speaker 2>tough question because I could say the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same thing about the story of Adam and </v>

1414
01:20:34.171 --> 01:20:37.680
<v Speaker 2>eve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean when I understood like,</v>

1415
01:20:38.070 --> 01:20:38.903
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gaining some of the insights that I've </v>

1416
01:20:41.431 --> 01:20:44.640
<v Speaker 2>had into these stories has really been a</v>
<v Speaker 2>mind altering experience.</v>

1417
01:20:44.641 --> 01:20:45.421
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1418
01:20:45.421 --> 01:20:46.254
<v Speaker 2>when I understood why it is in our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least I believe I understood why it </v>

1419
01:20:50.701 --> 01:20:51.534
<v Speaker 2>is that in the story of Adam and Eve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that human beings accrued the knowledge </v>

1420
01:20:54.601 --> 01:20:55.434
<v Speaker 2>of good and evil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they were transformed into moral </v>

1421
01:20:57.361 --> 01:21:01.080
<v Speaker 2>agents when the scales fell from their </v>
<v Speaker 2>eyes and they realized they were naked.</v>

1422
01:21:01.080 --> 01:21:03.420
<v Speaker 2>That was unbelievably powerful </v>
<v Speaker 2>revelation for me.</v>

1423
01:21:03.421 --> 01:21:04.254
<v Speaker 2>And the revelation was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for those of you who haven't heard me </v>

1424
01:21:06.121 --> 01:21:06.954
<v Speaker 2>talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's no difference between </v>

1425
01:21:09.181 --> 01:21:10.014
<v Speaker 2>recognizing that you're naked and </v>
<v Speaker 2>vulnerable and mortal and that you're </v>

1426
01:21:12.721 --> 01:21:15.300
<v Speaker 2>going to die so that you're a vulnerable</v>
<v Speaker 2>creature.</v>

1427
01:21:15.830 --> 01:21:19.140
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and being able to take advantage of that</v>

1428
01:21:19.141 --> 01:21:22.200
<v Speaker 2>vulnerability as it's manifested in </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself and other people.</v>

1429
01:21:22.470 --> 01:21:23.303
<v Speaker 2>So you cannot be evil without knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 2>of your own vulnerability and the </v>

1430
01:21:26.431 --> 01:21:27.264
<v Speaker 2>vulnerability of others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can be evil as soon as you know </v>

1431
01:21:29.791 --> 01:21:30.624
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because as soon as you understand that </v>

1432
01:21:31.591 --> 01:21:34.620
<v Speaker 2>vulnerability,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you understand how to exploit it.</v>

1433
01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:37.290
<v Speaker 2>So animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1434
01:21:37.291 --> 01:21:41.130
<v Speaker 2>predatory animals don't exploit the </v>
<v Speaker 2>vulnerability of their,</v>

1435
01:21:41.820 --> 01:21:43.560
<v Speaker 2>of their prey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they killed them.</v>

1436
01:21:43.561 --> 01:21:46.110
<v Speaker 2>And so in that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose it's an exploitation,</v>

1437
01:21:46.350 --> 01:21:49.590
<v Speaker 2>but they don't take conscious advantage </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the prey.</v>

1438
01:21:49.591 --> 01:21:52.680
<v Speaker 2>Knowing what would hurt them as </v>
<v Speaker 2>individuals,</v>

1439
01:21:52.681 --> 01:21:53.514
<v Speaker 2>the milks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't torture and they certainly </v>

1440
01:21:55.321 --> 01:21:57.960
<v Speaker 2>can't torture intensely and for long </v>
<v Speaker 2>periods of times,</v>

1441
01:21:57.961 --> 01:22:01.020
<v Speaker 2>like human beings scout now it requires </v>
<v Speaker 2>self consciousness.</v>

1442
01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:02.273
<v Speaker 2>And so it's the emergence of self </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness that gives people moral </v>

1443
01:22:05.130 --> 01:22:05.963
<v Speaker 2>agency because they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they develop the capacity for evil at </v>

1444
01:22:08.971 --> 01:22:11.910
<v Speaker 2>that point and developing the capacity </v>
<v Speaker 2>for evil.</v>

1445
01:22:11.911 --> 01:22:14.580
<v Speaker 2>They offer also develop the capacity for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the opposite.</v>

1446
01:22:14.610 --> 01:22:15.443
<v Speaker 2>Which minimum is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the decision not to be as Google would </v>

1447
01:22:20.011 --> 01:22:23.250
<v Speaker 2>put it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not to be any more evil than necessary.</v>

1448
01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:25.110
<v Speaker 2>Let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1449
01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:44.330
<v Speaker 2>Dr. Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>am I in the Illuminati?</v>

1450
01:22:44.930 --> 01:22:46.220
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1451
01:22:47.700 --> 01:22:50.810
<v Speaker 2>if I wasn't in the Illuminati and I said</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1452
01:22:50.930 --> 01:22:53.180
<v Speaker 2>that would just be proof that I was in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Illuminati.</v>

1453
01:22:53.181 --> 01:22:54.014
<v Speaker 2>So I don't see any way I can answer that</v>
<v Speaker 2>question without obviously offering </v>

1454
01:22:58.911 --> 01:23:01.760
<v Speaker 2>proof that I am in the Illuminati.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1455
01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:04.910
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1456
01:23:05.170 --> 01:23:06.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm in the Illuminati.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How's that?</v>

1457
01:23:06.790 --> 01:23:07.990
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that might work out?</v>

1458
01:23:08.260 --> 01:23:09.093
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1459
01:23:21.490 --> 01:23:22.600
<v Speaker 2>let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jordan,</v>

1460
01:23:22.660 --> 01:23:24.850
<v Speaker 2>Dr. Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will you visit Fredericton,</v>

1461
01:23:25.540 --> 01:23:27.690
<v Speaker 2>New Brunswick?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have visited Fredericton.</v>

1462
01:23:27.790 --> 01:23:30.130
<v Speaker 2>I actually had quite a nice time there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1463
01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:31.660
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm try,</v>

1464
01:23:31.690 --> 01:23:32.523
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try to limit my travel to </v>
<v Speaker 2>about once every six weeks because I </v>

1465
01:23:35.981 --> 01:23:38.650
<v Speaker 2>have a bunch of other obligations that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to keep up with.</v>

1466
01:23:39.100 --> 01:23:40.960
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and at the moment,</v>

1467
01:23:40.961 --> 01:23:41.794
<v Speaker 2>Fredericton isn't on my travel schedule.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am releasing a book in the early part </v>

1468
01:23:46.511 --> 01:23:47.344
<v Speaker 2>of 2018 it's called 12 rules for life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an antidote to chaos and it's 12 essays </v>

1469
01:23:54.971 --> 01:23:58.760
<v Speaker 2>that I derived from a set of answers </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I gave on the website.</v>

1470
01:23:58.790 --> 01:24:00.340
<v Speaker 2>Cora,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the question,</v>

1471
01:24:00.370 --> 01:24:03.070
<v Speaker 2>what are the most valuable things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone should know?</v>

1472
01:24:03.340 --> 01:24:05.440
<v Speaker 2>What are the most valuable things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone should know?</v>

1473
01:24:05.470 --> 01:24:06.303
<v Speaker 2>I think I wrote 42 little rules there </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can find </v>

1474
01:24:09.041 --> 01:24:12.110
<v Speaker 2>them@jordanbpeterson.com some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1475
01:24:12.270 --> 01:24:13.103
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're accompanied by photographic </v>

1476
01:24:14.201 --> 01:24:18.130
<v Speaker 2>images that one of my viewers has kindly</v>
<v Speaker 2>donated to the project.</v>

1477
01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:21.970
<v Speaker 2>People have been doing all sorts of Nice</v>
<v Speaker 2>and creative things for me,</v>

1478
01:24:21.971 --> 01:24:24.970
<v Speaker 2>helping me facilitate what I'm doing on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Youtube.</v>

1479
01:24:24.971 --> 01:24:27.020
<v Speaker 2>And they did that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1480
01:24:27.340 --> 01:24:28.173
<v Speaker 2>the reason I mentioned that is because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>presume that when that book is released </v>

1481
01:24:31.221 --> 01:24:35.320
<v Speaker 2>that I'll be going on a speaking tour </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's possible that Fredericton would</v>

1482
01:24:35.321 --> 01:24:36.154
<v Speaker 2>be on that agenda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know because none of that </v>

1483
01:24:38.051 --> 01:24:41.170
<v Speaker 2>has been formulated yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1484
01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:42.490
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the book,</v>

1485
01:24:42.900 --> 01:24:43.733
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy with the book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been writing it for about three </v>

1486
01:24:45.311 --> 01:24:46.144
<v Speaker 2>years and it's been quite thoroughly </v>
<v Speaker 2>edited and commented on by my editor at </v>

1487
01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:51.393
<v Speaker 2>Penguin Random House is publishing it in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Canada and fed a number of friends of </v>

1488
01:24:54.131 --> 01:24:57.510
<v Speaker 2>mine who are good authors and sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 2>excellent authors,</v>

1489
01:24:57.900 --> 01:24:58.840
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>review it.</v>

1490
01:24:59.350 --> 01:25:00.440
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1491
01:25:01.170 --> 01:25:02.003
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that should give me the opportunity to </v>

1492
01:25:02.951 --> 01:25:05.080
<v Speaker 2>do some more traveling and to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 2>the book.</v>

1493
01:25:05.081 --> 01:25:07.600
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1494
01:25:07.780 --> 01:25:08.613
<v Speaker 2>so let's say a Dr. Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did the postmodernist so </v>

1495
01:25:12.701 --> 01:25:14.860
<v Speaker 2>successfully take over the education </v>
<v Speaker 2>system?</v>

1496
01:25:14.890 --> 01:25:16.840
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should certainly knew,</v>

1497
01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:21.280
<v Speaker 2>wish I knew the answer to that dedicated</v>
<v Speaker 2>effort over three decades would do it.</v>

1498
01:25:21.281 --> 01:25:23.770
<v Speaker 2>But I would also say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1499
01:25:23.771 --> 01:25:28.510
<v Speaker 2>if people are continually funded by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>public purse for the political activity,</v>

1500
01:25:28.511 --> 01:25:32.980
<v Speaker 2>they can spend a tremendous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>time concentrating on it.</v>

1501
01:25:33.580 --> 01:25:34.413
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when you also add to that the fact </v>

1502
01:25:36.551 --> 01:25:39.280
<v Speaker 2>that 80% of humanities papers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1503
01:25:39.310 --> 01:25:40.143
<v Speaker 2>Garner zero citations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means essentially that no one </v>

1504
01:25:42.581 --> 01:25:45.310
<v Speaker 2>reads them or if they do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't do anything with them,</v>

1505
01:25:45.850 --> 01:25:46.683
<v Speaker 2>then you don't have to spend a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>time concentrating on what you're </v>

1506
01:25:49.691 --> 01:25:52.780
<v Speaker 2>writing because it tends to be a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>low quality,</v>

1507
01:25:52.781 --> 01:25:56.020
<v Speaker 2>at least judged by the standards of </v>
<v Speaker 2>attracting readership.</v>

1508
01:25:56.021 --> 01:25:56.854
<v Speaker 2>And so I would say we've devoted a </v>
<v Speaker 2>substantial proportion of the public </v>

1509
01:26:00.221 --> 01:26:01.054
<v Speaker 2>funding of higher education to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>production of precisely the kind of </v>

1510
01:26:03.561 --> 01:26:08.561
<v Speaker 2>ideological ideologically minded </v>
<v Speaker 2>activists who are aiming precisely at,</v>

1511
01:26:09.410 --> 01:26:10.243
<v Speaker 2>at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at occupying positions of power </v>

1512
01:26:11.811 --> 01:26:12.644
<v Speaker 2>everywhere they possibly can and </v>
<v Speaker 2>transforming the social institutions </v>

1513
01:26:15.561 --> 01:26:18.350
<v Speaker 2>into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into puppets of their particular form of</v>

1514
01:26:18.351 --> 01:26:19.970
<v Speaker 2>possession.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1515
01:26:21.770 --> 01:26:22.603
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1516
01:26:26.300 --> 01:26:27.133
<v Speaker 2>Iq and wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the relationship between Iq and </v>

1517
01:26:29.451 --> 01:26:30.284
<v Speaker 2>wisdom?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say virtually no relationship </v>

1518
01:26:32.001 --> 01:26:34.670
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There no evidence of any relationship.</v>

1519
01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:36.770
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1520
01:26:36.830 --> 01:26:39.650
<v Speaker 2>wisdom seems to be something more like </v>
<v Speaker 2>the balance between,</v>

1521
01:26:39.651 --> 01:26:40.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1522
01:26:40.100 --> 01:26:42.680
<v Speaker 2>a large set of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of abilities and virtues.</v>

1523
01:26:42.681 --> 01:26:45.620
<v Speaker 2>And there is no evidence that I know of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1524
01:26:45.860 --> 01:26:50.090
<v Speaker 2>that people with higher iqs are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are wiser than people without high iqs.</v>

1525
01:26:50.230 --> 01:26:52.280
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see any evidence for that.</v>

1526
01:26:52.700 --> 01:26:53.533
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think it's partly because you can </v>

1527
01:26:56.601 --> 01:26:57.470
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

1528
01:26:57.740 --> 01:26:58.573
<v Speaker 2>your capacity to think can lead you into</v>
<v Speaker 2>very bad places just as well in some </v>

1529
01:27:03.021 --> 01:27:05.210
<v Speaker 2>sense as it can lead you into very good </v>
<v Speaker 2>places.</v>

1530
01:27:05.450 --> 01:27:07.070
<v Speaker 2>So it's a tool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very,</v>

1531
01:27:07.071 --> 01:27:09.890
<v Speaker 2>very powerful tool and it's a tool that </v>
<v Speaker 2>can be wielded for,</v>

1532
01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:10.873
<v Speaker 2>for better or for worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even in relationship to your own </v>

1533
01:27:13.371 --> 01:27:15.620
<v Speaker 2>wellbeing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you seen many people who,</v>

1534
01:27:16.310 --> 01:27:17.143
<v Speaker 2>whose intelligence and rationality has </v>
<v Speaker 2>become nothing but the kind of critical </v>

1535
01:27:20.031 --> 01:27:22.430
<v Speaker 2>force that completely undermines their </v>
<v Speaker 2>capacity to live?</v>

1536
01:27:22.460 --> 01:27:24.980
<v Speaker 2>It makes them nihilistic and bitter and </v>
<v Speaker 2>resentful and,</v>

1537
01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:26.180
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1538
01:27:26.180 --> 01:27:27.013
<v Speaker 2>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and proud as well because it's very </v>

1539
01:27:28.581 --> 01:27:29.414
<v Speaker 2>intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People tend to be very proud of their </v>

1540
01:27:30.591 --> 01:27:31.424
<v Speaker 2>intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is also a mistake because they're </v>

1541
01:27:33.291 --> 01:27:34.124
<v Speaker 2>not the creators of that intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 2>and have no reason to take personal </v>

1542
01:27:36.681 --> 01:27:38.210
<v Speaker 2>credit for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1543
01:27:38.211 --> 01:27:40.130
<v Speaker 2>but wisdom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever wisdom is,</v>

1544
01:27:40.140 --> 01:27:40.973
<v Speaker 2>doesn't seem to be related to in any </v>
<v Speaker 2>straight forward manner to street </v>

1545
01:27:43.311 --> 01:27:45.140
<v Speaker 2>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1546
01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:46.873
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1547
01:27:51.700 --> 01:27:54.610
<v Speaker 2>someone says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I made the mistake of using,</v>

1548
01:27:55.670 --> 01:27:56.503
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic and recreational drugs to </v>

1549
01:27:58.901 --> 01:28:02.170
<v Speaker 2>access when I was young and I'm sorry I </v>
<v Speaker 2>missed,</v>

1550
01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:03.193
<v Speaker 2>I can't see the question right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to have to regenerate it </v>

1551
01:28:05.261 --> 01:28:09.040
<v Speaker 2>for memory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the consequence of that I believe is</v>

1552
01:28:09.041 --> 01:28:12.640
<v Speaker 2>that my ability to think has become very</v>
<v Speaker 2>cloudy and uncertain.</v>

1553
01:28:13.450 --> 01:28:14.283
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know what to do about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say that you should probably go </v>

1554
01:28:16.451 --> 01:28:19.600
<v Speaker 2>talk to a psychologist or a psychiatrist</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there,</v>

1555
01:28:19.730 --> 01:28:23.620
<v Speaker 2>there may be things that could be done </v>
<v Speaker 2>to sharpen your thinking up again,</v>

1556
01:28:23.650 --> 01:28:26.590
<v Speaker 2>and maybe some of them perversely enough</v>
<v Speaker 2>might be pharmacological.</v>

1557
01:28:26.591 --> 01:28:27.460
<v Speaker 2>Perhaps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1558
01:28:27.461 --> 01:28:31.390
<v Speaker 2>what you're describing could be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequence of something like depression</v>

1559
01:28:31.870 --> 01:28:34.610
<v Speaker 2>or even post traumatic stress disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1560
01:28:34.930 --> 01:28:37.780
<v Speaker 2>so because the evidence on the longterm </v>
<v Speaker 2>use of,</v>

1561
01:28:37.870 --> 01:28:40.240
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of psychedelic drugs for example,</v>

1562
01:28:40.720 --> 01:28:45.160
<v Speaker 2>isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't indicate that in that overall</v>

1563
01:28:45.161 --> 01:28:45.994
<v Speaker 2>they produce negative health </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences of the sort that you're </v>

1564
01:28:48.071 --> 01:28:48.820
<v Speaker 2>describing.</v>

1565
01:28:48.820 --> 01:28:53.110
<v Speaker 2>Now you might've had adulterated drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might've been one of those people.</v>

1566
01:28:53.111 --> 01:28:53.944
<v Speaker 2>And there do seem to be people like that</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are prone to negative consequences </v>

1567
01:28:57.491 --> 01:29:02.491
<v Speaker 2>for using various recreational drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I would say if you really think that</v>

1568
01:29:02.851 --> 01:29:04.950
<v Speaker 2>your cognitive ability has been </v>
<v Speaker 2>impaired,</v>

1569
01:29:04.951 --> 01:29:05.784
<v Speaker 2>you should probably go talk to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologist or a psychiatrist and see </v>

1570
01:29:07.711 --> 01:29:10.260
<v Speaker 2>if you can do something about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because sometimes,</v>

1571
01:29:10.261 --> 01:29:11.094
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>antidepressants or drugs like </v>

1572
01:29:12.391 --> 01:29:14.400
<v Speaker 2>Wellbutrin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is also an antidepressant,</v>

1573
01:29:14.401 --> 01:29:18.480
<v Speaker 2>but a different kind can be very useful </v>
<v Speaker 2>in restoring mental clarity.</v>

1574
01:29:18.810 --> 01:29:20.010
<v Speaker 2>It's worth a shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1575
01:29:20.100 --> 01:29:21.570
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to go through life like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1576
01:29:21.930 --> 01:29:23.240
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1577
01:29:24.990 --> 01:29:25.823
<v Speaker 2>Do I believe in the power of Lord Keck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think of the rise of belief </v>

1578
01:29:29.461 --> 01:29:30.960
<v Speaker 2>and need magic?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1579
01:29:31.260 --> 01:29:34.230
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's any different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the use of archetypal imagery.</v>

1580
01:29:34.290 --> 01:29:39.290
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know if if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean obviously archetypal imagery,</v>

1581
01:29:40.571 --> 01:29:43.690
<v Speaker 2>it has tremendous power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when,</v>

1582
01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:44.593
<v Speaker 2>when right now people are obsessed with </v>
<v Speaker 2>archetypes of chaos and Kik is a </v>

1583
01:29:48.721 --> 01:29:51.160
<v Speaker 2>manifestation of an archetype of chaos </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1584
01:29:51.200 --> 01:29:53.280
<v Speaker 2>and transformation because the frog is </v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

1585
01:29:53.700 --> 01:29:55.620
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a spirit of transformation.</v>

1586
01:29:55.621 --> 01:29:56.454
<v Speaker 2>I talked about that did an interview </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a great Russian Orthodox carver </v>

1587
01:30:00.511 --> 01:30:01.344
<v Speaker 2>named Jonathan Powell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's very knowledgeable about such </v>

1588
01:30:03.451 --> 01:30:04.380
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we did a,</v>

1589
01:30:04.470 --> 01:30:05.350
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1590
01:30:05.580 --> 01:30:08.430
<v Speaker 2>a youtube video on the metaphysics of </v>
<v Speaker 2>pepe.</v>

1591
01:30:08.431 --> 01:30:11.100
<v Speaker 2>And so if you're interested in that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might want to take a look at that.</v>

1592
01:30:12.280 --> 01:30:13.113
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1593
01:30:19.900 --> 01:30:22.870
<v Speaker 2>is there a universal female story </v>
<v Speaker 2>opposite to the hero myth?</v>

1594
01:30:23.140 --> 01:30:24.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there is.</v>

1595
01:30:24.161 --> 01:30:27.060
<v Speaker 2>I think it's beauty and the beast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1596
01:30:27.100 --> 01:30:32.100
<v Speaker 2>although I think that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the taming of the partner,</v>

1597
01:30:35.110 --> 01:30:38.050
<v Speaker 2>the taming of the wild partner as an as </v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

1598
01:30:38.170 --> 01:30:40.840
<v Speaker 2>as a myth is applicable to men and </v>
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>

1599
01:30:40.870 --> 01:30:41.703
<v Speaker 2>There's an element of taming that goes </v>
<v Speaker 2>on in a relationship regardless of the </v>

1600
01:30:45.911 --> 01:30:48.640
<v Speaker 2>sex of the people who were involved in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the relationship.</v>

1601
01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:51.280
<v Speaker 2>So men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>team women and women take men.</v>

1602
01:30:51.940 --> 01:30:52.773
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the idea of taming and </v>

1603
01:30:55.781 --> 01:30:56.614
<v Speaker 2>civilizing men is more directly a part </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the fundamental archetype of the </v>

1604
01:31:00.491 --> 01:31:01.324
<v Speaker 2>feminine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that for a variety of </v>

1605
01:31:03.281 --> 01:31:04.114
<v Speaker 2>reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think beauty and the beast might </v>

1606
01:31:05.501 --> 01:31:08.710
<v Speaker 2>be the canonical female heroes story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1607
01:31:08.830 --> 01:31:10.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would like to elaborate on that.</v>

1608
01:31:10.901 --> 01:31:11.734
<v Speaker 2>But what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm starting to get tired and I don't </v>

1609
01:31:13.241 --> 01:31:16.990
<v Speaker 2>have the mental energy to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I may do a video on beauty and the beast</v>

1610
01:31:16.991 --> 01:31:18.520
<v Speaker 2>though I'd like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would like to do that.</v>

1611
01:31:19.390 --> 01:31:21.340
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1612
01:31:27.610 --> 01:31:28.443
<v Speaker 2>what do I think is the archetype whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>significance of the popularity of the </v>

1613
01:31:31.031 --> 01:31:33.400
<v Speaker 2>anti hero in American television?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1614
01:31:33.401 --> 01:31:34.510
<v Speaker 2>well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's easy.</v>

1615
01:31:34.570 --> 01:31:38.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the anti hero nature,</v>

1616
01:31:39.550 --> 01:31:44.550
<v Speaker 2>nature made the proposition that he said</v>
<v Speaker 2>that morality is cowardice.</v>

1617
01:31:45.640 --> 01:31:48.040
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not exactly what he said.</v>

1618
01:31:48.430 --> 01:31:49.263
<v Speaker 2>What he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what he said in a more elaborated for </v>

1619
01:31:51.891 --> 01:31:52.724
<v Speaker 2>him is that very frequently people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>afraid to do things and they're often </v>

1620
01:31:57.551 --> 01:31:58.384
<v Speaker 2>things that other people regard bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And because they don't want to admit to </v>

1621
01:32:01.781 --> 01:32:05.710
<v Speaker 2>themselves that the reason they won't do</v>
<v Speaker 2>those things that are regarded as bad is</v>

1622
01:32:05.711 --> 01:32:06.544
<v Speaker 2>because they're cowardly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They pretended to that it's because </v>

1623
01:32:08.531 --> 01:32:09.364
<v Speaker 2>they're moral.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so often conventional morality is a </v>

1624
01:32:12.461 --> 01:32:13.294
<v Speaker 2>consequence of conventional cowardice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the problem with conventional </v>

1625
01:32:16.421 --> 01:32:19.810
<v Speaker 2>cowardice is that it's not sufficient to</v>
<v Speaker 2>solve serious problems.</v>

1626
01:32:20.050 --> 01:32:24.160
<v Speaker 2>And so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's necessary for a man and perhaps for</v>

1627
01:32:24.161 --> 01:32:24.994
<v Speaker 2>a woman as well to become a bit of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>monster or even a lot of a monster in </v>

1628
01:32:28.691 --> 01:32:31.030
<v Speaker 2>order to move through life successfully.</v>

1629
01:32:31.450 --> 01:32:36.450
<v Speaker 2>And that doesn't mean precisely that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to act out being a monster,</v>

1630
01:32:37.570 --> 01:32:38.403
<v Speaker 2>but it means that you need to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be a monster when the circumstances </v>

1631
01:32:41.201 --> 01:32:42.034
<v Speaker 2>demanded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the reason that anti heroes like </v>

1632
01:32:44.051 --> 01:32:45.400
<v Speaker 2>Walter White,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1633
01:32:45.730 --> 01:32:50.730
<v Speaker 2>are so popular in American culture is </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the criminal Walter White was by</v>

1634
01:32:51.281 --> 01:32:56.080
<v Speaker 2>no obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was in no obvious way,</v>

1635
01:32:56.081 --> 01:33:01.081
<v Speaker 2>less moral than the conventional and </v>
<v Speaker 2>cowardly Walter White.</v>

1636
01:33:01.900 --> 01:33:04.570
<v Speaker 2>Now you might say he went from one </v>
<v Speaker 2>extreme to another,</v>

1637
01:33:04.600 --> 01:33:05.433
<v Speaker 2>which he did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also the case that in order to </v>

1638
01:33:08.860 --> 01:33:09.693
<v Speaker 2>expand past the domains of conventional </v>
<v Speaker 2>morality slash cowardice from the </v>

1639
01:33:13.541 --> 01:33:14.374
<v Speaker 2>Nietzschean perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's necessary to incorporate elements </v>

1640
01:33:17.861 --> 01:33:18.694
<v Speaker 2>of the shadow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's in some sense what needs you </v>

1641
01:33:20.981 --> 01:33:23.890
<v Speaker 2>meant when he said that we need to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>beyond good and evil.</v>

1642
01:33:23.891 --> 01:33:24.724
<v Speaker 2>And it's certainly what you meant when </v>
<v Speaker 2>he said that it's necessary for someone </v>

1643
01:33:27.701 --> 01:33:28.534
<v Speaker 2>who wants to burst forth from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>potentially pathological combined </v>

1644
01:33:32.380 --> 01:33:36.150
<v Speaker 2>confines of their conventional persona </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the,</v>

1645
01:33:36.310 --> 01:33:40.750
<v Speaker 2>the journey towards individuation and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the development of the self was that</v>

1646
01:33:40.810 --> 01:33:42.790
<v Speaker 2>the shadow had to be incorporated.</v>

1647
01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:46.480
<v Speaker 2>And that means often in part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the capacity for aggression,</v>

1648
01:33:46.860 --> 01:33:49.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the capacity for sexual expression,</v>

1649
01:33:49.420 --> 01:33:53.860
<v Speaker 2>the capacity to defy defy convention,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that capacity to take your own road.</v>

1650
01:33:54.170 --> 01:33:55.003
<v Speaker 2>And that's all predicated on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>development of an inner relationship </v>

1651
01:33:57.761 --> 01:33:58.594
<v Speaker 2>with the monster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's the same idea that's expressed </v>

1652
01:34:00.701 --> 01:34:01.534
<v Speaker 2>in Harry Potter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Harry Potter is actually able to combat </v>

1653
01:34:04.991 --> 01:34:05.824
<v Speaker 2>voldemort who's essentially Satan for </v>
<v Speaker 2>all intents and purposes because he has </v>

1654
01:34:10.060 --> 01:34:13.330
<v Speaker 2>a pace of evil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lodged firmly within him.</v>

1655
01:34:13.750 --> 01:34:15.440
<v Speaker 2>And it's also what makes him a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1656
01:34:15.580 --> 01:34:18.400
<v Speaker 2>redeeming rule breaker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1657
01:34:18.610 --> 01:34:21.850
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the anti hero is the shadow,</v>

1658
01:34:22.330 --> 01:34:23.163
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the shadow is the thing that the </v>

1659
01:34:25.871 --> 01:34:28.330
<v Speaker 2>persona needs to incorporate to become </v>
<v Speaker 2>the hero.</v>

1660
01:34:29.260 --> 01:34:32.980
<v Speaker 2>So</v>
<v Speaker 2>South Fresno says,</v>

1661
01:34:32.981 --> 01:34:36.010
<v Speaker 2>I preached a sermon and use some of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>cane enables stuff.</v>

1662
01:34:36.040 --> 01:34:37.000
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's good.</v>

1663
01:34:37.001 --> 01:34:39.670
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my cane enables stuff though much as I'd</v>

1664
01:34:39.671 --> 01:34:40.780
<v Speaker 2>like to take credit for it.</v>

1665
01:34:41.090 --> 01:34:42.640
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm happy to hear that.</v>

1666
01:34:42.690 --> 01:34:43.800
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1667
01:34:44.200 --> 01:34:45.033
<v Speaker 2>I hope it worked well and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that there were people at your </v>

1668
01:34:46.751 --> 01:34:49.090
<v Speaker 2>sermon because otherwise that would be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

1669
01:34:49.570 --> 01:34:51.070
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1670
01:34:51.100 --> 01:34:52.810
<v Speaker 2>Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's your favorite mean?</v>

1671
01:34:52.811 --> 01:34:55.930
<v Speaker 2>Made a view?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1672
01:34:57.020 --> 01:34:58.410
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1673
01:34:58.910 --> 01:35:00.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I've developed a </v>
<v Speaker 2>favorite.</v>

1674
01:35:01.250 --> 01:35:03.530
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me think about that for a minute.</v>

1675
01:35:04.550 --> 01:35:07.220
<v Speaker 2>I find the fact that they're being made </v>
<v Speaker 2>of great amusement,</v>

1676
01:35:07.250 --> 01:35:08.083
<v Speaker 2>I think it's absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's absolutely absurd and ridiculous </v>

1677
01:35:10.551 --> 01:35:13.100
<v Speaker 2>and I can't believe that it's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1678
01:35:13.790 --> 01:35:15.770
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that that's not much of an answer</v>

1679
01:35:15.771 --> 01:35:16.760
<v Speaker 2>to your question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1680
01:35:17.270 --> 01:35:19.820
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find the whole category,</v>

1681
01:35:21.670 --> 01:35:23.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what to say about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's surreal.</v>

1682
01:35:24.940 --> 01:35:27.370
<v Speaker 2>It's a surreal phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1683
01:35:27.371 --> 01:35:32.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the association that has emerged between</v>

1684
01:35:32.021 --> 01:35:34.990
<v Speaker 2>me and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and kermit the frog and pepe,</v>

1685
01:35:35.020 --> 01:35:36.910
<v Speaker 2>I also find that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1686
01:35:36.970 --> 01:35:41.970
<v Speaker 2>that was actually the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>market form of synchronicity that I,</v>

1687
01:35:43.190 --> 01:35:44.023
<v Speaker 2>I've ever seen manifest itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was really something quite </v>

1688
01:35:46.251 --> 01:35:49.940
<v Speaker 2>remarkable and amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I talk about that also with Jonathan</v>

1689
01:35:49.940 --> 01:35:52.100
<v Speaker 2>Patio on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the metaphysics of pepe.</v>

1690
01:35:52.790 --> 01:35:53.623
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1691
01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:20.460
<v Speaker 2>turned off again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1692
01:36:20.580 --> 01:36:21.413
<v Speaker 2>I turned it back on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems to turn off on a relatively </v>

1693
01:36:23.581 --> 01:36:25.500
<v Speaker 2>regular basis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there must be something.</v>

1694
01:36:25.620 --> 01:36:26.453
<v Speaker 2>There must be some setting that we just </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't understand that any of you have a </v>

1695
01:36:28.561 --> 01:36:29.394
<v Speaker 2>Canon camera and you use it for video </v>
<v Speaker 2>broadcasting and it shuts off now and </v>

1696
01:36:33.751 --> 01:36:35.840
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know why you could,</v>

1697
01:36:35.841 --> 01:36:37.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put that in the comment section.</v>

1698
01:36:37.420 --> 01:36:38.253
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure we'll figure it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it does seem to be a regular </v>

1699
01:36:40.261 --> 01:36:41.850
<v Speaker 2>occurrence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1700
01:36:42.280 --> 01:36:43.113
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm going to sign out here pretty </v>

1701
01:36:44.671 --> 01:36:45.504
<v Speaker 2>quick because I'm starting to wear out </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't want to say anything </v>

1702
01:36:48.330 --> 01:36:49.163
<v Speaker 2>pathologically idiotic for public </v>
<v Speaker 2>consumption and that could happen and </v>

1703
01:36:53.101 --> 01:36:54.960
<v Speaker 2>that would be a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1704
01:36:55.320 --> 01:36:56.700
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's see.</v>

1705
01:36:56.701 --> 01:36:58.290
<v Speaker 2>I'll ask answer one more question.</v>

1706
01:36:59.370 --> 01:37:00.203
<v Speaker 1>MMM.</v>

1707

<v Speaker 2>go to sleep at Canon.</v>

1708
01:37:15.251 --> 01:37:16.960
<v Speaker 2>Cameras in the tea range.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go to sleep.</v>

1709
01:37:16.990 --> 01:37:18.010
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you very much.</v>

1710

1712
01:37:22.420 --> 01:37:23.253
<v Speaker 2>please correct me if I'm wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that that is the delightful </v>

1713
01:37:26.561 --> 01:37:29.140
<v Speaker 2>gentleman from Mexico who's produced </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1714
01:37:29.850 --> 01:37:32.590
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>excellent graphic intro that I use on my</v>

1715
01:37:32.591 --> 01:37:34.900
<v Speaker 2>videos and he's produced another one for</v>
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

1716
01:37:35.110 --> 01:37:38.830
<v Speaker 2>which I'm going to be using on my </v>
<v Speaker 2>youtube interviews.</v>

1717
01:37:38.920 --> 01:37:40.890
<v Speaker 2>So thank you very much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Luis,</v>

<v Speaker 2>or Louie and I will check that out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1720
01:37:45.520 --> 01:37:47.290
<v Speaker 2>that's a good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's good hint.</v>

1721
01:37:47.291 --> 01:37:50.290
<v Speaker 2>Thank you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are my personal spiritual practices</v>

1722
01:37:50.291 --> 01:37:52.270
<v Speaker 2>and rituals?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1723
01:37:53.940 --> 01:37:56.650
<v Speaker 2>the simpsons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1724
01:37:57.210 --> 01:37:58.043
<v Speaker 2>I'm absolutely addicted to the simpsons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I've watched every single </v>

1725
01:38:00.391 --> 01:38:02.730
<v Speaker 2>episode of the simpsons at least five </v>
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>

1726
01:38:02.970 --> 01:38:03.803
<v Speaker 2>Generally what I do is I start with </v>
<v Speaker 2>episode one and I go through all of </v>

1727
01:38:06.211 --> 01:38:07.044
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that takes about a year or maybe a </v>

1728
01:38:09.690 --> 01:38:10.523
<v Speaker 2>year and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I started at the beginning and </v>

1729
01:38:11.911 --> 01:38:13.110
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I go through them again.</v>

1730
01:38:13.140 --> 01:38:14.940
<v Speaker 2>And I also watched the trailer park </v>
<v Speaker 2>boys.</v>

1731
01:38:14.941 --> 01:38:17.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm very embarrassed to state to say </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1732
01:38:17.041 --> 01:38:17.874
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've also quite addicted to the trailer </v>

1733
01:38:19.261 --> 01:38:22.560
<v Speaker 2>park boys and that's outside on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what to say about that,</v>

1734
01:38:22.580 --> 01:38:23.413
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1735
01:38:23.580 --> 01:38:24.413
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that bubbles is one of the most </v>

1736
01:38:25.770 --> 01:38:29.190
<v Speaker 2>remarkable comedic characters that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Canadian comics have ever developed.</v>

1737
01:38:29.191 --> 01:38:30.024
<v Speaker 2>And I think the same thing about ricky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really think that show is a profane </v>

1738
01:38:34.590 --> 01:38:35.423
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and distasteful work of genius and it's </v>

1739
01:38:38.671 --> 01:38:39.504
<v Speaker 2>a guilty pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I guess those are my spiritual </v>

1740
01:38:41.140 --> 01:38:44.070
<v Speaker 2>practice watching the simpsons in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>trailer park boys.</v>

1741
01:38:44.550 --> 01:38:45.383
<v Speaker 2>I should also tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because this is a funny story and </v>

1742
01:38:46.861 --> 01:38:47.694
<v Speaker 2>because my son happens to be sitting </v>
<v Speaker 2>here with me and he can tell you that </v>

1743
01:38:49.681 --> 01:38:52.050
<v Speaker 2>this is the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When my kids were little,</v>

1744
01:38:52.051 --> 01:38:52.884
<v Speaker 2>we didn't have a television and the only</v>
<v Speaker 2>television show I ever let them watch </v>

1745
01:38:56.251 --> 01:38:58.380
<v Speaker 2>was the simpsons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1746
01:38:58.381 --> 01:39:00.360
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when they were really little,</v>

1747
01:39:00.361 --> 01:39:01.194
<v Speaker 2>I used to cover up their eyes when itchy</v>
<v Speaker 2>and scratchy came on because I thought </v>

1748
01:39:03.691 --> 01:39:04.890
<v Speaker 2>that was a bit too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1749
01:39:05.230 --> 01:39:06.063
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought that the simpsons was a very </v>

1750
01:39:07.231 --> 01:39:10.440
<v Speaker 2>honest satirical show and that it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>teaching them the proper,</v>

1751
01:39:12.390 --> 01:39:15.900
<v Speaker 2>the proper rules of life and they didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>seem to turn out too badly.</v>

1752
01:39:15.901 --> 01:39:17.610
<v Speaker 2>And they have really good senses of </v>
<v Speaker 2>humor.</v>

1753
01:39:17.611 --> 01:39:18.660
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1754
01:39:18.750 --> 01:39:21.630
<v Speaker 2>so it seems to have worked on all </v>
<v Speaker 2>Simpson Diet.</v>

1755
01:39:21.660 --> 01:39:23.970
<v Speaker 2>That's not the ritual I recommend for </v>
<v Speaker 2>children.</v>

1756
01:39:24.090 --> 01:39:25.680
<v Speaker 2>I didn't take them to church,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

1757
01:39:26.070 --> 01:39:26.903
<v Speaker 2>I had them watch the simpsons on regular</v>
<v Speaker 2>basis and probably I should be hauled </v>

1758
01:39:30.061 --> 01:39:31.760
<v Speaker 2>off in front of the child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1759
01:39:31.770 --> 01:39:34.260
<v Speaker 2>child welfare people for that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>admitting it.</v>

1760
01:39:34.260 --> 01:39:35.093
<v Speaker 2>And that's why I need to stop because </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you other things that I've </v>

1761
01:39:37.051 --> 01:39:39.740
<v Speaker 2>done and I'll get myself in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

1762
01:39:40.470 --> 01:39:42.870
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1763
01:39:42.930 --> 01:39:43.763
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Louie Guillermo Martinez has been </v>

1764
01:39:45.091 --> 01:39:48.120
<v Speaker 2>zone says also when no one presses any </v>
<v Speaker 2>buttons.</v>

1765
01:39:48.630 --> 01:39:49.800
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1766
01:39:50.010 --> 01:39:50.843
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it is set to automatically shut off </v>

1767
01:39:52.501 --> 01:39:54.570
<v Speaker 2>because it assumes that no one is doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

1768
01:39:54.660 --> 01:39:55.493
<v Speaker 2>Do you know Louis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I can do to stop it from shutting </v>

1769
01:39:57.631 --> 01:39:58.464
<v Speaker 2>off because I don't want to get up in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the middle of a broadcast and like push </v>

1770
01:40:01.381 --> 01:40:02.760
<v Speaker 2>a button.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1771
01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:05.010
<v Speaker 2>so much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much appreciated.</v>

1772
01:40:05.550 --> 01:40:07.350
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1773
01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:10.400
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm going to stop guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1774
01:40:11.580 --> 01:40:12.413
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate the support very much and </v>

1775
01:40:14.281 --> 01:40:17.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing my best to put it to the best </v>
<v Speaker 2>of all possible uses.</v>

1776
01:40:17.671 --> 01:40:18.504
<v Speaker 2>One thing I couldn't tell you is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that I'm doing this series on </v>

1777
01:40:21.661 --> 01:40:22.140
<v Speaker 2>the Bible.</v>

1778
01:40:22.140 --> 01:40:22.973
<v Speaker 2>You may know that or may not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to start I believe May 16th </v>

1779
01:40:25.321 --> 01:40:26.154
<v Speaker 2>but possibly May 23rd and I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go through the Bible from beginning to </v>

1780
01:40:30.031 --> 01:40:33.270
<v Speaker 2>end describing the psychological </v>
<v Speaker 2>significance of the stories.</v>

1781
01:40:33.271 --> 01:40:35.580
<v Speaker 2>But another thing that I've got involved</v>
<v Speaker 2>in recently,</v>

1782
01:40:35.581 --> 01:40:38.460
<v Speaker 2>and this is in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's in its early stages of development,</v>

1783
01:40:38.461 --> 01:40:39.294
<v Speaker 2>but I met a group of of moderate Muslim </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectuals in Toronto a couple of </v>

1784
01:40:44.911 --> 01:40:49.410
<v Speaker 2>times now and they're planning a </v>
<v Speaker 2>reformist movement,</v>

1785
01:40:49.530 --> 01:40:52.530
<v Speaker 2>a reformist Islam movement that will be </v>
<v Speaker 2>grounded in Canada.</v>

1786
01:40:52.531 --> 01:40:55.570
<v Speaker 2>And I hope to be involved in out in some</v>
<v Speaker 2>integral manner,</v>

1787
01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:56.433
<v Speaker 2>partly as a consequence of doing youtube</v>
<v Speaker 2>videos and podcast interviews on the </v>

1788
01:41:00.011 --> 01:41:00.844
<v Speaker 2>topic of Islam and on how it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how it's more extremist elements might </v>

1789
01:41:05.381 --> 01:41:08.050
<v Speaker 2>be properly Moto Mod,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your ma moderate it.</v>

1790
01:41:08.470 --> 01:41:09.303
<v Speaker 2>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a big deal and who knows if </v>

1791
01:41:11.021 --> 01:41:11.854
<v Speaker 2>that'll go anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's definitely something that I </v>

1792
01:41:13.631 --> 01:41:16.720
<v Speaker 2>want to devote my attention towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it seems like an extraordinarily</v>

1793
01:41:16.780 --> 01:41:17.590
<v Speaker 2>important topic.</v>

1794
01:41:17.590 --> 01:41:20.290
<v Speaker 2>And so with any luck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be able to concentrate my attention</v>

1795
01:41:20.291 --> 01:41:21.124
<v Speaker 2>on elucidating the psychological </v>
<v Speaker 2>significance of the biblical stories </v>

1796
01:41:24.161 --> 01:41:24.994
<v Speaker 2>from beginning to end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also engage in a dialogue with </v>

1797
01:41:27.310 --> 01:41:28.143
<v Speaker 2>intelligent and careful and thoughtful </v>
<v Speaker 2>moderate Muslims about how we might </v>

1798
01:41:31.421 --> 01:41:32.254
<v Speaker 2>bridge the gap between our two </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilizations in a manner that would be </v>

1799
01:41:35.381 --> 01:41:38.200
<v Speaker 2>productive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's part of what I'm,</v>

1800
01:41:39.340 --> 01:41:42.580
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm aiming out utilizing the</v>
<v Speaker 2>resources that you,</v>

1801
01:41:42.581 --> 01:41:43.414
<v Speaker 2>people are partly providing me with as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well as continuing to develop the </v>

1802
01:41:46.451 --> 01:41:48.120
<v Speaker 2>youtube channel and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

1803
01:41:48.160 --> 01:41:48.993
<v Speaker 2>the biblical lectures will be taped by </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same people who'd be doing my </v>

1804
01:41:51.161 --> 01:41:52.030
<v Speaker 2>lectures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1805
01:41:52.580 --> 01:41:53.980
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's part of,</v>

1806
01:41:54.100 --> 01:41:57.970
<v Speaker 2>that's part of the upcoming plan over </v>
<v Speaker 2>the next couple of years.</v>

1807
01:41:57.971 --> 01:41:58.804
<v Speaker 2>So I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that might be enough if I could do </v>

1808
01:42:00.131 --> 01:42:03.790
<v Speaker 2>those two things extraordinarily well or</v>
<v Speaker 2>even well,</v>

1809
01:42:03.791 --> 01:42:05.530
<v Speaker 2>hopefully I could do them </v>
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily well,</v>

1810
01:42:05.531 --> 01:42:08.650
<v Speaker 2>but if I could devote my efforts to </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing that credibly,</v>

1811
01:42:08.651 --> 01:42:10.660
<v Speaker 2>that would be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be really worth,</v>

1812
01:42:10.680 --> 01:42:12.130
<v Speaker 2>that would be something really worth </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

1813
01:42:12.670 --> 01:42:13.503
<v Speaker 2>So thank you all and thank you for </v>
<v Speaker 2>putting up with the technical glitches </v>

1814
01:42:17.711 --> 01:42:18.970
<v Speaker 2>and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'll,</v>

1815
01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:20.850
<v Speaker 2>I'll get better at this as I go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1816
01:42:20.950 --> 01:42:22.900
<v Speaker 2>you know how it is when you first do </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

1817
01:42:22.901 --> 01:42:26.170
<v Speaker 2>It's okay if you're a fool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as long as you're not any more of a fool</v>

1818
01:42:26.171 --> 01:42:27.004
<v Speaker 2>than you have to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you get better at things by doing </v>

1819
01:42:29.291 --> 01:42:32.110
<v Speaker 2>them somewhat badly to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

1820
01:42:32.860 --> 01:42:33.693
<v Speaker 2>thanks very much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll see some of you again in a month </v>

1821
01:42:35.260 --> 01:42:36.093
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1822
01:42:36.580 --> 01:42:37.413
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>over now and thanks to Julian very much </v>

1823
01:42:39.971 --> 01:42:42.730
<v Speaker 2>for helping me sort this out and set it </v>
<v Speaker 2>up good night.</v>

1824
01:42:50.150 --> 01:42:50.983
<v Speaker 1>Hm.</v>
