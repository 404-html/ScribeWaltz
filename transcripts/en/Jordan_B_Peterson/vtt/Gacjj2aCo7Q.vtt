1
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.090
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're always in a situation,</v>

2
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.600
<v Speaker 1>and this is occurs across multiple</v>
<v Speaker 1>levels of analysis because I could say,</v>

3
00:00:09.601 --> 00:00:11.010
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when are you in the garden?</v>

4
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:12.720
<v Speaker 1>And one answer could be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

5
00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:16.020
<v Speaker 1>when you're in a beautiful house or in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful hotel or in a well functioning</v>

6
00:00:16.021 --> 00:00:20.010
<v Speaker 1>institution or in a city that's working,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can also say you're in a garden</v>

7
00:00:20.011 --> 00:00:25.011
<v Speaker 1>when your conception of the world is</v>
<v Speaker 1>sufficient that when you enacted it</v>

8
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.070
<v Speaker 1>allows the world to be fruitful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a garden too,</v>

9
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.460
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because so your internal psychological</v>

10
00:00:32.461 --> 00:00:34.920
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the conceptions that you use first of</v>

11
00:00:34.921 --> 00:00:36.960
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there obviously analogous to culture,</v>

12
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.100
<v Speaker 1>but they're also analogous to a garden</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that way and light culture,</v>

13
00:00:41.101 --> 00:00:45.530
<v Speaker 1>they can be disrupted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know what it's like people,</v>

14
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.560
<v Speaker 1>they say this all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish that hadn't happened and what</v>

15
00:00:50.611 --> 00:00:55.611
<v Speaker 1>they mean by that is Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in a pretty good place before that</v>

16
00:00:55.831 --> 00:00:57.480
<v Speaker 1>event occurred.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

17
00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.650
<v Speaker 1>on a big moral eric and really do that</v>
<v Speaker 1>to you.</v>

18
00:00:59.651 --> 00:01:01.380
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do something that you really think</v>

19
00:01:01.381 --> 00:01:05.370
<v Speaker 1>is stupid and you know you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just shattered.</v>

20
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.410
<v Speaker 1>Really sometimes sheltered enough to</v>
<v Speaker 1>develop post traumatic stress disorder</v>

21
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.490
<v Speaker 1>so you can't get rid of the snakes.</v>

22
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.830
<v Speaker 1>That's the first idea in the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then the issue is,</v>

23
00:01:20.831 --> 00:01:21.940
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you do with the stakes?</v>

24
00:01:21.941 --> 00:01:26.350
<v Speaker 1>What God basically told even Adam not</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

25
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.710
<v Speaker 1>he didn't really tell them not to</v>
<v Speaker 1>interact with the snakes and he put a</v>

26
00:01:29.711 --> 00:01:32.170
<v Speaker 1>snake in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's partly because in a sense</v>

27
00:01:32.171 --> 00:01:35.410
<v Speaker 1>it's not possible to create a garden</v>
<v Speaker 1>without having a snake in it because you</v>

28
00:01:35.411 --> 00:01:38.230
<v Speaker 1>can't keep everything out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not possible.</v>

29
00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.750
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the snake comes along and it says,</v>

30
00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.120
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you do this thing that God</v>

31
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.230
<v Speaker 1>for bade a lot of wonderful things will</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

32
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.270
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is where it gets.</v>

33
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.760
<v Speaker 1>It gets extraordinarily complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

34
00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.290
<v Speaker 1>let me finish this part of the story and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we'll go back.</v>

35
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.630
<v Speaker 1>The serpent said unto the woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shall not surely die for God knows</v>

36
00:02:05.631 --> 00:02:08.720
<v Speaker 1>that in the day you eat thereof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then your eyes will be opened and you</v>

37
00:02:08.721 --> 00:02:10.520
<v Speaker 1>will be as gods knowing good and evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

38
00:02:10.521 --> 00:02:12.920
<v Speaker 1>so what can we conclude from that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

39
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.750
<v Speaker 1>first thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that their eyes were closed because</v>

40
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.910
<v Speaker 1>if they weren't closed and how could</v>
<v Speaker 1>they be opened and the second thing is</v>

41
00:02:22.911 --> 00:02:24.710
<v Speaker 1>they didn't know the difference between</v>
<v Speaker 1>good and evil.</v>

42
00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.820
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that explains the whole shame naked</v>

43
00:02:28.821 --> 00:02:31.310
<v Speaker 1>and not ashamed issue because if your</v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes are closed,</v>

44
00:02:31.311 --> 00:02:32.880
<v Speaker 1>while that's irrelevant and if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

45
00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.880
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's no moral knowledge,</v>

46
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.380
<v Speaker 1>there's obviously no shame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's happening here is that there's</v>

47
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:40.243
<v Speaker 1>a very,</v>

48
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:42.643
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

49
00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.090
<v Speaker 1>profound distinction being made between</v>
<v Speaker 1>the before fruit eating state of being</v>

50
00:02:50.141 --> 00:02:55.141
<v Speaker 1>in the after fruit eating state of being</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the before fruit eating and snake</v>

51
00:02:55.241 --> 00:02:59.020
<v Speaker 1>interacting mode of being and the after</v>
<v Speaker 1>fruit eating and snake interacting mode</v>

52
00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.300
<v Speaker 1>of being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's reasonable to think of</v>

53
00:03:01.301 --> 00:03:04.030
<v Speaker 1>that on a historical timeline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

54
00:03:04.031 --> 00:03:09.031
<v Speaker 1>that that is one of the major.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are two of the major forces that</v>

55
00:03:09.941 --> 00:03:13.150
<v Speaker 1>shaped our evolutionary history and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that things were different before</v>

56
00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:15.850
<v Speaker 1>that and after that is a perfectly</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable presupposition.</v>

57
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.200
<v Speaker 1>Something put us on the path to very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very rapid cortical development.</v>

58
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.930
<v Speaker 1>Vision is certainly one of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>factors.</v>

59
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.330
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the fruit eating element,</v>

60
00:03:25.331 --> 00:03:28.900
<v Speaker 1>well that's where we have color vision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when it isn't obvious exactly what</v>

61
00:03:28.901 --> 00:03:32.170
<v Speaker 1>that did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it did a lot and things so.</v>

62
00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.050
<v Speaker 1>And then the next thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there's no moral knowledge now</v>

63
00:03:36.051 --> 00:03:40.100
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting because it implies</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's some tight link between</v>

64
00:03:40.101 --> 00:03:42.500
<v Speaker 1>having your eyes closed and not having</v>
<v Speaker 1>moral knowledge.</v>

65
00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.010
<v Speaker 1>So to have your eyes closed just to not</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be able to see.</v>

66
00:03:46.011 --> 00:03:48.140
<v Speaker 1>So there's a kind of unconsciousness</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

67
00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.700
<v Speaker 1>And when the woman saw that the tree was</v>
<v Speaker 1>good for food and that it was pleasant</v>

68
00:03:52.701 --> 00:03:56.930
<v Speaker 1>to the eyes and a tree to be desired to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make one wise,</v>

69
00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.950
<v Speaker 1>she took of the fruit thereof and did</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat and gave also unto her husband with</v>

70
00:04:00.951 --> 00:04:01.850
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he did eat</v>

71
00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.140
<v Speaker 1>and the eyes of both of them were opened</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they knew they were naked and they</v>

72
00:04:09.141 --> 00:04:11.720
<v Speaker 1>sewed fig leaves together and made</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves aprons.</v>

73
00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.510
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's quite an interesting sequence</v>

74
00:04:14.511 --> 00:04:16.640
<v Speaker 1>of events.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're tempted by this thing that's</v>

75
00:04:16.641 --> 00:04:21.641
<v Speaker 1>subtle and dangerous and the consequence</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the temptation is the ingestion of</v>

76
00:04:21.711 --> 00:04:23.930
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The incorporation of something with</v>

77
00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.650
<v Speaker 1>transformative properties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the transformation is profound.</v>

78
00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.490
<v Speaker 1>What happens is they open their eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

79
00:04:31.491 --> 00:04:34.940
<v Speaker 1>that's coming to consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what that is.</v>

80
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.710
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when a kitten opens its eyes,</v>

81
00:04:36.711 --> 00:04:38.600
<v Speaker 1>it finally enters the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

82
00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.110
<v Speaker 1>so people had their eyes closed before</v>
<v Speaker 1>this event.</v>

83
00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:47.493
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they weren't.</v>

84
00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:53.020
<v Speaker 1>They weren't conscious in the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that would account for the unity of</v>

85
00:04:53.021 --> 00:04:55.450
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not separated from.</v>

86
00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.800
<v Speaker 1>They're not separate beings on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ground of existence.</v>

87
00:04:59.801 --> 00:05:01.870
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they have the same kind of life as</v>

88
00:05:01.871 --> 00:05:02.800
<v Speaker 1>animals too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

89
00:05:02.801 --> 00:05:06.850
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just unconscious or at least non</v>

90
00:05:06.851 --> 00:05:10.810
<v Speaker 1>self conscious entities of nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no nakedness,</v>

91
00:05:10.811 --> 00:05:12.460
<v Speaker 1>there's no knowledge of good and evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

92
00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.650
<v Speaker 1>do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't blame a lion for eating it,</v>

93
00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.220
<v Speaker 1>for eating a sheep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

94
00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.360
<v Speaker 1>They used to eat sheep in the Middle</v>
<v Speaker 1>East,</v>

95
00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.150
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't think that's an evil.</v>

96
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.480
<v Speaker 1>They don't think of the lion is evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just think that that's what lions</v>

97
00:05:25.481 --> 00:05:27.700
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now someone comes along and steals your</v>

98
00:05:27.701 --> 00:05:29.200
<v Speaker 1>sheep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a whole different issue.</v>

99
00:05:29.201 --> 00:05:32.140
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden there's a moral issue</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's overlaid upon that and you say,</v>

100
00:05:32.141 --> 00:05:32.741
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>

101
00:05:32.741 --> 00:05:34.390
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is all of a sudden there were moral</v>

102
00:05:34.391 --> 00:05:37.060
<v Speaker 1>issue and then the answer to that would</v>
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

103
00:05:37.061 --> 00:05:39.220
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the person either does know the</v>

104
00:05:39.221 --> 00:05:41.770
<v Speaker 1>difference between good and bad or</v>
<v Speaker 1>should know it,</v>

105
00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:43.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if he says,</v>

106
00:05:43.811 --> 00:05:45.460
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just acting like a lion,</v>

107
00:05:45.461 --> 00:05:46.720
<v Speaker 1>that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just not gonna.</v>

108
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.200
<v Speaker 1>No one's gonna accept that as an excuse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is there's a</v>

109
00:05:50.201 --> 00:05:54.490
<v Speaker 1>basic assumption that there's something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you know that lions don't and why?</v>

110
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:55.870
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because your eyes are open in a</v>

111
00:05:55.871 --> 00:05:57.440
<v Speaker 1>different way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

112
00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.860
<v Speaker 1>well that seems to be reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they opened their eyes and bang,</v>

113
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:03.080
<v Speaker 1>they know they're naked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

114
00:06:03.081 --> 00:06:05.600
<v Speaker 1>That's an interesting juxtaposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

115
00:06:05.601 --> 00:06:10.601
<v Speaker 1>so let's say you develop a higher form</v>
<v Speaker 1>of consciousness and that makes you self</v>

116
00:06:10.941 --> 00:06:12.710
<v Speaker 1>conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's two things happening here.</v>

117
00:06:12.711 --> 00:06:15.660
<v Speaker 1>There's an elevation of consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but out of that spring,</v>

118
00:06:15.661 --> 00:06:18.050
<v Speaker 1>self consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you've got to think,</v>

119
00:06:18.051 --> 00:06:19.610
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does selfconsciousness mean</v>

120
00:06:19.611 --> 00:06:22.070
<v Speaker 1>exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

121
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.980
<v Speaker 1>because you're not fully self conscious</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason you're not fully self</v>

122
00:06:25.981 --> 00:06:28.070
<v Speaker 1>consciousness because you don't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything about yourself,</v>

123
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:29.510
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're,</v>

124
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.610
<v Speaker 1>you're ignorant of a lot of your own</v>
<v Speaker 1>being,</v>

125
00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:32.930
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of your being.</v>

126
00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:34.240
<v Speaker 1>You're not ignorant about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

127
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:35.960
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can identify yourself as an</v>

128
00:06:35.961 --> 00:06:39.440
<v Speaker 1>individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you've got the identify yourself in</v>

129
00:06:39.441 --> 00:06:41.780
<v Speaker 1>the mirror trick down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of the standard trick for</v>

130
00:06:41.781 --> 00:06:42.920
<v Speaker 1>animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>self consciousness,</v>

131
00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:44.830
<v Speaker 1>but that's only the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the bear,</v>

132
00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:49.040
<v Speaker 1>beginnings of self consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're so.</v>

133
00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.470
<v Speaker 1>If you're self conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know where your boundaries are</v>

134
00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:54.530
<v Speaker 1>because what's inside the boundary is</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and what's outside isn't you?</v>

135
00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:57.170
<v Speaker 1>But then there's other boundaries that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have.</v>

136
00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.070
<v Speaker 1>There's a temporal boundary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

137
00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.720
<v Speaker 1>there's the time when you weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there was the time when you won't</v>

138
00:07:02.721 --> 00:07:04.940
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so there's a boundary of space,</v>

139
00:07:04.941 --> 00:07:08.570
<v Speaker 1>but there's a boundary in time and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>means that as soon as you become self</v>

140
00:07:08.571 --> 00:07:10.820
<v Speaker 1>conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that you're going to die.</v>

141
00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:14.960
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the type link between the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fruit of the tree of knowledge of good</v>

142
00:07:14.961 --> 00:07:19.760
<v Speaker 1>and evil and the and death in the Old</v>
<v Speaker 1>Testament or in the genesis story.</v>

143
00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.150
<v Speaker 1>So and you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you were going to die before</v>

144
00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:27.890
<v Speaker 1>and fair enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a big difference between a</v>

145
00:07:27.891 --> 00:07:30.560
<v Speaker 1>death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that death of a self conscious entity</v>

146
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.970
<v Speaker 1>and death in the one case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a natural process that you know</v>

147
00:07:34.971 --> 00:07:37.370
<v Speaker 1>that that's natural death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

148
00:07:37.371 --> 00:07:38.300
<v Speaker 1>And the other one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

149
00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:42.830
<v Speaker 1>it's a catastrophe of being for the self</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious individual.</v>

150
00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.110
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the other thing that happens is</v>

151
00:07:45.111 --> 00:07:49.820
<v Speaker 1>in the genesis story that that discovery</v>
<v Speaker 1>is portrayed as a permanent rift in the</v>

152
00:07:49.821 --> 00:07:52.520
<v Speaker 1>structure of Ba.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's such a deep sin.</v>

153
00:07:52.521 --> 00:07:56.330
<v Speaker 1>It's like all of a sudden everything is</v>
<v Speaker 1>different and it will never be the same</v>

154
00:07:56.331 --> 00:07:57.830
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No matter what happens,</v>

155
00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:01.550
<v Speaker 1>you know when you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well obviously God was an enemy of</v>

156
00:08:01.551 --> 00:08:03.330
<v Speaker 1>higher consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

157
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:05.000
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of interpretations of</v>

158
00:08:05.001 --> 00:08:06.290
<v Speaker 1>generous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That took exactly that.</v>

159
00:08:06.291 --> 00:08:08.950
<v Speaker 1>Stats said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well God was an enemy of higher</v>

160
00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:09.793
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

161
00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:13.400
<v Speaker 1>You wanted things to remain in an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in an unconscious paradise and that it</v>

162
00:08:13.401 --> 00:08:15.060
<v Speaker 1>was human,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

163
00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:19.670
<v Speaker 1>unwillingness to behave and curiosity</v>
<v Speaker 1>that God has sent to the problem that</v>

164
00:08:19.671 --> 00:08:22.070
<v Speaker 1>we're in and it's actually actually a</v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe,</v>

165
00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:24.680
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then other people who were sort of</v>

166
00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:29.200
<v Speaker 1>high that had more say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>admiration for the illumination and self</v>

167
00:08:29.201 --> 00:08:33.110
<v Speaker 1>consciousness elements said that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that tempted human beings was a</v>

168
00:08:33.111 --> 00:08:36.020
<v Speaker 1>greater God than the God that originally</v>
<v Speaker 1>did the creation.</v>

169
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:38.380
<v Speaker 1>That was a gnostic idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

170
00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:43.500
<v Speaker 1>So the serpent therapy becomes an agent</v>
<v Speaker 1>of revelation in a sense,</v>

171
00:08:44.031 --> 00:08:45.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anyways,</v>

172
00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:47.060
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've laid out the problem,</v>

173
00:08:47.061 --> 00:08:49.790
<v Speaker 1>this is the problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden people woke up and when</v>

174
00:08:49.791 --> 00:08:51.920
<v Speaker 1>they woke up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they noticed who they were and they</v>

175
00:08:51.921 --> 00:08:53.930
<v Speaker 1>weren't happy about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do they notice?</v>

176
00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:55.470
<v Speaker 1>They're naked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

177
00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:56.940
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what?</v>

178
00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:57.751
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

179
00:08:57.751 --> 00:08:58.590
<v Speaker 1>you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what?</v>

180
00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:00.990
<v Speaker 1>Instantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the first thing they do is make</v>

181
00:09:00.991 --> 00:09:01.824
<v Speaker 1>fig leaves.</v>

182
00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:06.800
<v Speaker 1>They make</v>
<v Speaker 1>clothing out of fiddly and cover</v>

183
00:09:06.801 --> 00:09:08.720
<v Speaker 1>themselves up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While you know,</v>

184
00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:13.370
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's culture and you think,</v>

185
00:09:13.371 --> 00:09:15.740
<v Speaker 1>well what's good?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the utility of culture?</v>

186
00:09:15.741 --> 00:09:18.530
<v Speaker 1>But that's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Culture is the barrier between us and</v>

187
00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:21.200
<v Speaker 1>our own nakedness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the barrier between our nakedness</v>

188
00:09:21.201 --> 00:09:23.240
<v Speaker 1>and the natural world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

189
00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.970
<v Speaker 1>why do you put on clothes so you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>freeze to death,</v>

190
00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:28.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're not as easily attacked.</v>

191
00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:32.300
<v Speaker 1>It's like as soon as you know you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>naked and vulnerable and you're self</v>

192
00:09:32.301 --> 00:09:34.250
<v Speaker 1>conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you extend yourself across time,</v>

193
00:09:34.251 --> 00:09:36.800
<v Speaker 1>you discovered time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that not only are you</v>

194
00:09:36.801 --> 00:09:39.050
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to be vulnerable in the</v>

195
00:09:39.051 --> 00:09:41.180
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So are your children and their children.</v>

196
00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:44.870
<v Speaker 1>It's like the whole nature of being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you've added a dimension to</v>

197
00:09:44.871 --> 00:09:48.140
<v Speaker 1>the nature of being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've added time to it and it's a</v>

198
00:09:48.141 --> 00:09:49.880
<v Speaker 1>radical transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>

199
00:09:49.881 --> 00:09:51.890
<v Speaker 1>well that's good because lions don't eat</v>
<v Speaker 1>you as often.</v>

200
00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:53.540
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

201
00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:58.160
<v Speaker 1>the zebras don't seem that upset on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>plains of the Serengeti when the lions</v>

202
00:09:58.161 --> 00:10:00.980
<v Speaker 1>are around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One's going to pick one off now and</v>

203
00:10:00.981 --> 00:10:02.150
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the lion,</v>

204
00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:04.310
<v Speaker 1>the zebras aren't running around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

205
00:10:04.311 --> 00:10:07.700
<v Speaker 1>with anxiety disorders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>popping value them all the time because</v>

206
00:10:07.701 --> 00:10:10.730
<v Speaker 1>the lions are there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not the case with human</v>

207
00:10:10.731 --> 00:10:12.170
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see a line and we think,</v>

208
00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.810
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some at some point that line's going to</v>

209
00:10:14.811 --> 00:10:18.650
<v Speaker 1>want to eat one of us and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and lions in general will do that.</v>

210
00:10:18.651 --> 00:10:21.800
<v Speaker 1>So not only do we have to solve the</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem of that line right now,</v>

211
00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:25.190
<v Speaker 1>we have to solve the problem of all</v>
<v Speaker 1>lions for all time,</v>

212
00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:28.310
<v Speaker 1>which we actually seem to be doing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>very good job of now because soon there</v>

213
00:10:28.311 --> 00:10:30.690
<v Speaker 1>won't be any of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

214
00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:32.420
<v Speaker 1>so that sort of thing can get out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>hand.</v>

215
00:10:32.421 --> 00:10:33.800
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you get the point.</v>

216
00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:38.540
<v Speaker 1>So okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they sewed fig leaves together and</v>

217
00:10:38.541 --> 00:10:41.360
<v Speaker 1>they made themselves aprons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

218
00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:46.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sexual element of it too is I think</v>

219
00:10:46.961 --> 00:10:51.961
<v Speaker 1>also that the reason sexuality is tied</v>
<v Speaker 1>in there so tightly is because the most</v>

220
00:10:52.721 --> 00:10:56.680
<v Speaker 1>sexual parts of a human being are also</v>
<v Speaker 1>the parts that are the most vulnerable.</v>

221
00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.390
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not only,</v>

222
00:10:58.391 --> 00:11:00.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability to judgment</v>

223
00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:04.540
<v Speaker 1>and vulnerability to exploitation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a huge deal,</v>

224
00:11:04.541 --> 00:11:08.830
<v Speaker 1>especially in the case of women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's also the fact that just from a</v>

225
00:11:08.831 --> 00:11:11.770
<v Speaker 1>purely physical perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are the most delicate tissues.</v>

226
00:11:11.771 --> 00:11:14.890
<v Speaker 1>And so the fact that they are fully</v>
<v Speaker 1>exposed is really a big problem.</v>

227
00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:18.520
<v Speaker 1>So okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now they're naked.</v>

228
00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:20.050
<v Speaker 1>They got aprons on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

229
00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:23.700
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not in unconscious paradise</v>

230
00:11:23.701 --> 00:11:25.350
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then what happens?</v>

231
00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:29.160
<v Speaker 1>And they heard the voice of the Lord God</v>
<v Speaker 1>walking in the garden in the cool of the</v>

232
00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.720
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Adam and his wife hid themselves</v>

233
00:11:30.721 --> 00:11:33.390
<v Speaker 1>from the presence of the Lord God</v>
<v Speaker 1>amongst the trees of the garden.</v>

234
00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:39.570
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine how you could possibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>pack more meaning into two sentences.</v>

235
00:11:39.571 --> 00:11:40.050
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

236
00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:44.880
<v Speaker 1>you can tell people have been at this</v>
<v Speaker 1>for like 25,000 years because see what</v>

237
00:11:44.881 --> 00:11:47.650
<v Speaker 1>happens here is that there's an idea to</v>
<v Speaker 1>begin with,</v>

238
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:50.700
<v Speaker 1>that there's a complete unity between</v>
<v Speaker 1>God and his creation,</v>

239
00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:52.950
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that there's the natural order is</v>

240
00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:56.050
<v Speaker 1>undisturbed and all of a sudden that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>fractured.</v>

241
00:11:56.650 --> 00:12:01.300
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens is that human beings</v>
<v Speaker 1>are divorced from the divinity.</v>

242
00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:04.840
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And not only are they divorced from it,</v>

243
00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:09.100
<v Speaker 1>they're unwilling to expose themselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>to it.</v>

244
00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:10.750
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so think about.</v>

245
00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:15.460
<v Speaker 1>Think about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will take a take a side step for a</v>

246
00:12:15.461 --> 00:12:16.294
<v Speaker 1>minute.</v>

247
00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:27.521
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

248
00:12:27.521 --> 00:12:32.521
<v Speaker 1>imagine that you could exist in a manner</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was on perfect.</v>

249
00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:35.770
<v Speaker 1>The question might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

250
00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:39.190
<v Speaker 1>what would stop you from doing it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

251
00:12:39.191 --> 00:12:42.790
<v Speaker 1>one thing might be that you couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>envision something as useless as you are</v>

252
00:12:42.791 --> 00:12:45.620
<v Speaker 1>actually managing that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you,</v>

253
00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:48.490
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you think about what stands in the</v>

254
00:12:48.491 --> 00:12:52.870
<v Speaker 1>road of people as obstacles to their</v>
<v Speaker 1>full self realization,</v>

255
00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:58.180
<v Speaker 1>the easiest way to encapsulate that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they view themselves as inadequate.</v>

256
00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.700
<v Speaker 1>Now there's other things as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to take the</v>

257
00:13:00.701 --> 00:13:05.050
<v Speaker 1>responsibility and so forth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know it's very difficult to heat</v>

258
00:13:05.051 --> 00:13:08.650
<v Speaker 1>a divine call.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say when you're stuck in this</v>

259
00:13:08.651 --> 00:13:13.651
<v Speaker 1>little ratty contraption that is prone</v>
<v Speaker 1>to disease and I'm prone to shame and</v>

260
00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:18.250
<v Speaker 1>prone to age and prone to death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's like how can you continue in</v>

261
00:13:18.251 --> 00:13:21.610
<v Speaker 1>some divine manner when you've come to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the realization that there are,</v>

262
00:13:21.611 --> 00:13:22.990
<v Speaker 1>you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

263
00:13:22.991 --> 00:13:26.200
<v Speaker 1>and people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly people derive the conclusion</v>

264
00:13:26.201 --> 00:13:29.230
<v Speaker 1>fairly frequently that there are so</v>
<v Speaker 1>appalling,</v>

265
00:13:29.231 --> 00:13:32.620
<v Speaker 1>but it would be better if they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>obliterated along with everyone else.</v>

266
00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:37.390
<v Speaker 1>It's not as if the realization of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature of our own physical being was</v>

267
00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:40.810
<v Speaker 1>something that freed people up to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>courageous.</v>

268
00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:42.760
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was quite the reverse.</v>

269
00:13:42.761 --> 00:13:45.940
<v Speaker 1>Although I think people can still be</v>
<v Speaker 1>courageous in front of it and in spite</v>

270
00:13:45.941 --> 00:13:47.950
<v Speaker 1>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's definitely in spite of it.</v>

271
00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:51.370
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the classic definitions of true</v>

272
00:13:51.371 --> 00:13:54.100
<v Speaker 1>courage aren't that you're not afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that you're afraid,</v>

273
00:13:54.101 --> 00:13:55.990
<v Speaker 1>but you do it anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

274
00:13:55.991 --> 00:13:57.560
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you that fear is,</v>

275
00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:01.360
<v Speaker 1>and shame is an integral part of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as you realize that you're</v>

276
00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:05.320
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable to social evaluation and</v>
<v Speaker 1>natural degeneration,</v>

277
00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:07.720
<v Speaker 1>you're stuck with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so then bang,</v>

278
00:14:07.721 --> 00:14:10.360
<v Speaker 1>you're divorced from your divine mode of</v>
<v Speaker 1>being,</v>

279
00:14:10.361 --> 00:14:13.210
<v Speaker 1>we'll say partly at least because you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>just afraid to manifest it.</v>

280
00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:14.740
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what happened.</v>

281
00:14:14.741 --> 00:14:17.830
<v Speaker 1>So Adam and Eve hide from God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it seems to be really</v>

282
00:14:17.831 --> 00:14:21.040
<v Speaker 1>counterproductive because you might</v>
<v Speaker 1>think that if they didn't hide from God,</v>

283
00:14:21.041 --> 00:14:22.240
<v Speaker 1>then there wouldn't be a problem.</v>

284
00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:26.740
<v Speaker 1>They can be naked and no problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that isn't what happened and the</v>

285
00:14:26.741 --> 00:14:28.900
<v Speaker 1>Lord God calls onto Adam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says unto him,</v>

286
00:14:28.901 --> 00:14:30.340
<v Speaker 1>where are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where are you?</v>

287
00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:33.280
<v Speaker 1>And Adam says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard your voice in the garden,</v>

288
00:14:33.281 --> 00:14:37.090
<v Speaker 1>so there's a call there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was afraid because I was naked.</v>

289
00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:39.400
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that pretty much explains it and I hit</v>

290
00:14:39.401 --> 00:14:41.170
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

291
00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:44.050
<v Speaker 1>And God said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who told you that you were naked?</v>

292
00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:47.950
<v Speaker 1>Have you eaten of the tree whereof I</v>
<v Speaker 1>commanded thee that thou shouldn't show</v>

293
00:14:47.951 --> 00:14:50.770
<v Speaker 1>this naughty?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who told me that that was naked?</v>

294
00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:54.980
<v Speaker 1>I believe women told men that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a very accurate summation</v>

295
00:14:54.981 --> 00:14:56.630
<v Speaker 1>of the relationship between men and</v>
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>

296
00:14:57.310 --> 00:15:00.740
<v Speaker 1>What all we develop consciousness across</v>
<v Speaker 1>the span of evolutionary history.</v>

297
00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:02.390
<v Speaker 1>And I believe it for a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>

298
00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:06.120
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual selection is a huge factor in,</v>

299
00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:10.880
<v Speaker 1>in what created human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And women primarily do the selection.</v>

300
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.030
<v Speaker 1>They're the bottleneck and they're the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bottleneck.</v>

301
00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:16.040
<v Speaker 1>Because women can't have that many</v>
<v Speaker 1>offspring,</v>

302
00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:19.280
<v Speaker 1>they can only have a few.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that makes them the bottleneck by</v>

303
00:15:19.281 --> 00:15:22.970
<v Speaker 1>definition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And women are so choosy about men that</v>

304
00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:25.220
<v Speaker 1>twice as many women have children as</v>
<v Speaker 1>men.</v>

305
00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:29.360
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what that means is on average means</v>

306
00:15:29.361 --> 00:15:31.850
<v Speaker 1>that I know it's kind of hard to</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand,</v>

307
00:15:31.851 --> 00:15:34.970
<v Speaker 1>but imagine every single woman has one</v>
<v Speaker 1>child.</v>

308
00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:39.170
<v Speaker 1>And then imagine half the men have zero</v>
<v Speaker 1>and half of them have to.</v>

309
00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:41.720
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the case.</v>

310
00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:45.530
<v Speaker 1>So statistically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>half man,</v>

311
00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:48.980
<v Speaker 1>half of all men were write offs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's actually worse than that</v>

312
00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:52.700
<v Speaker 1>because some men have so many offspring</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is not even funny,</v>

313
00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:54.470
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that Kinda cuts,</v>

314
00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:58.850
<v Speaker 1>it cuts the number of successful men</v>
<v Speaker 1>down by many.</v>

315
00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:04.480
<v Speaker 1>So women are a bottleneck and they do</v>
<v Speaker 1>judgment and and rightly so and they</v>

316
00:16:05.091 --> 00:16:07.730
<v Speaker 1>judged them according to their</v>
<v Speaker 1>insufficiency.</v>

317
00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:10.910
<v Speaker 1>And that is what makes men</v>
<v Speaker 1>unselfconscious obviously.</v>

318
00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:13.970
<v Speaker 1>And it's the thing that makes them more</v>
<v Speaker 1>self conscious than anything else.</v>

319
00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:17.540
<v Speaker 1>Now to men's credit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me tell you about the bower birds.</v>

320
00:16:17.541 --> 00:16:19.430
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So bowerbirds,</v>

321
00:16:19.431 --> 00:16:23.000
<v Speaker 1>they're very cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They live on the ground and the males</v>

322
00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:24.960
<v Speaker 1>make these incredibly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

323
00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:27.200
<v Speaker 1>we've a nest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of like a hammock.</v>

324
00:16:27.201 --> 00:16:29.630
<v Speaker 1>It's real soft.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they hang that into tree and</v>

325
00:16:29.631 --> 00:16:33.350
<v Speaker 1>then they sweep out their front yard and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they decorate it with bits of like</v>

326
00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:35.850
<v Speaker 1>the blue leaves are over here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's some red leaves here</v>

327
00:16:35.851 --> 00:16:37.460
<v Speaker 1>and there's a nice display of green</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

328
00:16:37.461 --> 00:16:40.450
<v Speaker 1>And maybe there's some glass there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like this little art work,</v>

329
00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:43.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the bower birds have these more or</v>

330
00:16:43.461 --> 00:16:47.030
<v Speaker 1>less enroll say in the same territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the females come hopping along</v>

331
00:16:47.031 --> 00:16:50.060
<v Speaker 1>and they take a look at this thing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they like it,</v>

332
00:16:50.061 --> 00:16:52.760
<v Speaker 1>well then they're willing to become a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little more friendly with that</v>

333
00:16:52.761 --> 00:16:53.720
<v Speaker 1>particular bowerbird.</v>

334
00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:55.490
<v Speaker 1>And if they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they fly away.</v>

335
00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:58.250
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if the male bowerbird has three</v>

336
00:16:58.251 --> 00:17:00.710
<v Speaker 1>female visitors and nothing pans out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then he,</v>

337
00:17:00.711 --> 00:17:02.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has a little fit and erases all</v>

338
00:17:02.751 --> 00:17:04.820
<v Speaker 1>creation that he asked to do another</v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

339
00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:09.590
<v Speaker 1>And so like you just have to think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that for 15 minutes and it pretty much</v>

340
00:17:09.591 --> 00:17:14.591
<v Speaker 1>explains human beings just like men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One response that man could have had was</v>

341
00:17:14.991 --> 00:17:17.660
<v Speaker 1>just to go hide in a shell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some of them do that.</v>

342
00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:21.360
<v Speaker 1>That is absolutely a common response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to never come out and spend the rest</v>

343
00:17:21.361 --> 00:17:24.410
<v Speaker 1>of his life playing video games in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>basement and eating Cheetos,</v>

344
00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:26.010
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then you know,</v>

345
00:17:26.090 --> 00:17:27.820
<v Speaker 1>the other responses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

346
00:17:27.850 --> 00:17:31.670
<v Speaker 1>all better transform myself into</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that isn't going to produce</v>

347
00:17:31.671 --> 00:17:34.730
<v Speaker 1>that response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a central part of,</v>

348
00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:37.040
<v Speaker 1>that's a central part of male</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation.</v>

349
00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:39.410
<v Speaker 1>It's a central element of male</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation.</v>

350
00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:43.130
<v Speaker 1>So if you're ever wondering why men are</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way they are,</v>

351
00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:46.670
<v Speaker 1>that real answer to that is because</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how they evolve to oppress women.</v>

352
00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:49.620
<v Speaker 1>So because obviously if that wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have happened,</v>

353
00:17:49.621 --> 00:17:53.550
<v Speaker 1>given that sexual selection is such a</v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful selecting force among human</v>

354
00:17:53.551 --> 00:17:55.710
<v Speaker 1>beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it wouldn't have worked out.</v>

355
00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:58.500
<v Speaker 1>So men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women don't make men self conscious,</v>

356
00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:00.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it's more than that too,</v>

357
00:18:00.811 --> 00:18:05.220
<v Speaker 1>because you could see a positive</v>
<v Speaker 1>feedback loop emerging as we got more</v>

358
00:18:05.221 --> 00:18:07.560
<v Speaker 1>cognitively sophisticated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

359
00:18:07.561 --> 00:18:10.260
<v Speaker 1>when you can think of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that was an arms race between men,</v>

360
00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:13.050
<v Speaker 1>women and snakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

361
00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:16.260
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we got more cognitively</v>

362
00:18:16.261 --> 00:18:18.570
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the prices we paid for that was</v>

363
00:18:18.571 --> 00:18:22.200
<v Speaker 1>that our hand expanded and one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>prices women paid for that was that</v>

364
00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:26.550
<v Speaker 1>childbirth became increasingly difficult</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the babies kept getting born</v>

365
00:18:26.551 --> 00:18:28.560
<v Speaker 1>younger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that meant that women became</v>

366
00:18:28.561 --> 00:18:28.890
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>

367
00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:33.330
<v Speaker 1>As we became more cognitively able,</v>
<v Speaker 1>paradoxically,</v>

368
00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:37.290
<v Speaker 1>women became more vulnerable at certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>key points of their lives because they</v>

369
00:18:37.291 --> 00:18:40.440
<v Speaker 1>had increasingly fragile babies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

370
00:18:40.441 --> 00:18:42.270
<v Speaker 1>how did women deal with that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

371
00:18:42.271 --> 00:18:47.271
<v Speaker 1>I think they shamed men into becoming</v>
<v Speaker 1>caregivers of children because how else</v>

372
00:18:47.671 --> 00:18:51.330
<v Speaker 1>would it have happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the typical mit mammo mail doesn't</v>

373
00:18:51.331 --> 00:18:54.870
<v Speaker 1>hang around provisioning the litter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

374
00:18:54.871 --> 00:18:57.540
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the males will eat the comms.</v>

375
00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:01.140
<v Speaker 1>You don't want a black male.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Black bear around wolves are an</v>

376
00:19:01.141 --> 00:19:04.500
<v Speaker 1>exception to this and you know there are</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals that are an exception.</v>

377
00:19:04.501 --> 00:19:06.810
<v Speaker 1>It happens in other species other than</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings,</v>

378
00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:11.220
<v Speaker 1>but human beings have this incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>long period of dependence that also</v>

379
00:19:11.221 --> 00:19:15.210
<v Speaker 1>requires a relationship for that</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to the remain in tact.</v>

380
00:19:15.211 --> 00:19:18.210
<v Speaker 1>There has to be a fair bit of integrity</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the communication between the</v>

381
00:19:18.211 --> 00:19:20.790
<v Speaker 1>partners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a real moral demand there as</v>

382
00:19:20.791 --> 00:19:21.624
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

383
00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:26.210
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adam doesn't show himself here as a</v>

384
00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:28.320
<v Speaker 1>particularly courageous individual</v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

385
00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:31.260
<v Speaker 1>which I think is quite comical when God</v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

386
00:19:31.261 --> 00:19:33.030
<v Speaker 1>hold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who told you that you were naked?</v>

387
00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:36.000
<v Speaker 1>Have you eaten of that tree?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which I told you not to.</v>

388
00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:39.870
<v Speaker 1>The man says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the woman who you gave to me,</v>

389
00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:42.510
<v Speaker 1>she gave me the tree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tree,</v>

390
00:19:42.511 --> 00:19:44.790
<v Speaker 1>and I did eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is it doesn't say much for his</v>

391
00:19:44.791 --> 00:19:48.660
<v Speaker 1>moral character because he rats out the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first chance he gets so,</v>

392
00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:53.870
<v Speaker 1>which I also think isn't like the comedy</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that is underrated in this story.</v>

393
00:19:54.241 --> 00:19:57.840
<v Speaker 1>That's a very funny sequence of events</v>
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

394
00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:02.640
<v Speaker 1>and so the God talks to the woman who</v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

395
00:20:02.641 --> 00:20:03.870
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's this that you did?</v>

396
00:20:03.871 --> 00:20:05.220
<v Speaker 1>And the woman said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the serpent.</v>

397
00:20:05.221 --> 00:20:08.220
<v Speaker 1>It was the serpent's fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The serpent beguiled me and I did eat.</v>

398
00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:13.610
<v Speaker 1>Let me show you out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I've showed you this picture</v>

399
00:20:13.611 --> 00:20:15.530
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's such a crazy cool picture.</v>

400
00:20:15.531 --> 00:20:16.580
<v Speaker 1>I want to show it to you again.</v>

401
00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:35.690
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

402
00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:37.880
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason this just doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>seem to be working.</v>

403
00:20:37.881 --> 00:20:40.610
<v Speaker 1>So I'll tell you about the picture and</v>
<v Speaker 1>still it's a very car with</v>

404
00:20:40.611 --> 00:20:44.720
<v Speaker 1>representation and Christian iconography</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what it basically shows us that Mary</v>

405
00:20:44.721 --> 00:20:46.450
<v Speaker 1>is holding up this incident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

406
00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:49.240
<v Speaker 1>up off the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's got her foot on a snake or a</v>

407
00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:50.270
<v Speaker 1>lizard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

408
00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:53.110
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't take a biological genius to</v>

409
00:20:53.111 --> 00:20:56.020
<v Speaker 1>figure out what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means like the good mother keeps the</v>

410
00:20:56.021 --> 00:20:58.690
<v Speaker 1>baby away from predatory reptiles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

411
00:20:58.691 --> 00:21:02.320
<v Speaker 1>and so you can see that as part of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>feedback loop that developed,</v>

412
00:21:02.321 --> 00:21:05.440
<v Speaker 1>so there's predation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's particularly focused on women and</v>

413
00:21:05.441 --> 00:21:07.060
<v Speaker 1>children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly what it would be</v>

414
00:21:07.061 --> 00:21:11.560
<v Speaker 1>focused on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So and then in order for that to not be</v>

415
00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:14.980
<v Speaker 1>to not the catastrophic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the women are appealing to the men</v>

416
00:21:14.981 --> 00:21:17.860
<v Speaker 1>for protection and that starts to</v>
<v Speaker 1>increase because the women gets more</v>

417
00:21:17.861 --> 00:21:20.260
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable as we get smarter and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>babies get smaller.</v>

418
00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:25.260
<v Speaker 1>And so there's this triadic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive feedback loop that occurs that</v>

419
00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:28.090
<v Speaker 1>wraps up brain development and we need</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

420
00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:30.520
<v Speaker 1>There has to be a reason for the brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>development.</v>

421
00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:32.550
<v Speaker 1>This is called a baldwin effect by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

422
00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:35.890
<v Speaker 1>in biology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Baldwin effect is where something</v>

423
00:21:35.891 --> 00:21:39.610
<v Speaker 1>happens to produce an outcome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something biological happens that</v>

424
00:21:39.611 --> 00:21:43.300
<v Speaker 1>produces a cultural outcome that</v>
<v Speaker 1>increases the probability that that</v>

425
00:21:43.301 --> 00:21:46.510
<v Speaker 1>biological adaptations will serve</v>
<v Speaker 1>fitness.</v>

426
00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:49.900
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beavers cut down trees.</v>

427
00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:51.970
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what that means is that the beavers</v>

428
00:21:51.971 --> 00:21:54.820
<v Speaker 1>that are more adapted to aquatic</v>
<v Speaker 1>environments do better.</v>

429
00:21:54.821 --> 00:21:58.660
<v Speaker 1>So as the beavers get more adapted to</v>
<v Speaker 1>aquatic environments and cutting down</v>

430
00:21:58.661 --> 00:22:00.430
<v Speaker 1>trees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they cut down more trees and make more</v>

431
00:22:00.431 --> 00:22:03.460
<v Speaker 1>aquatic environments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the thing spins until you get an</v>

432
00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:06.730
<v Speaker 1>animal that's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really well adapted to doing precisely</v>

433
00:22:06.731 --> 00:22:07.990
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

434
00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:10.690
<v Speaker 1>something happened to our cortex up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

435
00:22:10.691 --> 00:22:13.170
<v Speaker 1>very short order and it was shorter or</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

436
00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:17.440
<v Speaker 1>it was so short that the human female</v>
<v Speaker 1>pelvic structure could barely keep up,</v>

437
00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:21.550
<v Speaker 1>which is why birth is so rough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And why so many children die in</v>

438
00:22:21.551 --> 00:22:22.384
<v Speaker 1>childbirth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

439
00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:25.810
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't happen much anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it used to happen a lot.</v>

440
00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:28.840
<v Speaker 1>But before that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle of the 20th century,</v>

441
00:22:28.841 --> 00:22:30.910
<v Speaker 1>women were dying in childbirth all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

442
00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:35.320
<v Speaker 1>Plus it's extraordinarily difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even though the baby is born</v>

443
00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:37.810
<v Speaker 1>premature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for all intents and purposes,</v>

444
00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:40.090
<v Speaker 1>it's still hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is the hand is</v>

445
00:22:40.091 --> 00:22:43.930
<v Speaker 1>so big and it's even compressible</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the baby's head isn't fully</v>

446
00:22:43.931 --> 00:22:46.390
<v Speaker 1>formed when it's born.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bones have gaps in them.</v>

447
00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:50.650
<v Speaker 1>So the baby's head compresses and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like mad visibly.</v>

448
00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:51.933
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

449
00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:57.820
<v Speaker 1>so the woman says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

450
00:22:57.821 --> 00:23:00.570
<v Speaker 1>it was the serpent's fault,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>

451
00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:04.000
<v Speaker 1>when you could almost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could also say this ties into the</v>

452
00:23:04.001 --> 00:23:07.450
<v Speaker 1>issue of women induced selfconsciousness</v>
<v Speaker 1>among men.</v>

453
00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:11.500
<v Speaker 1>So like if the woman's primary primary</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem is predation,</v>

454
00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:14.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for her and the infant because of her</v>

455
00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:18.670
<v Speaker 1>being burdened with the infants and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>infant's complete and absolute inability</v>

456
00:23:18.671 --> 00:23:22.120
<v Speaker 1>to defend itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's going to drive the probability</v>

457
00:23:22.121 --> 00:23:25.390
<v Speaker 1>that she's going to select someone for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>partner who can get rid of the damn</v>

458
00:23:25.391 --> 00:23:27.430
<v Speaker 1>snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you know,</v>

459
00:23:27.431 --> 00:23:30.610
<v Speaker 1>when you see that echoed over and over</v>
<v Speaker 1>and human iconography,</v>

460
00:23:30.611 --> 00:23:32.920
<v Speaker 1>it's like the hero is the person who</v>
<v Speaker 1>confronts the Dragon.</v>

461
00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:34.870
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what do you do when you confront?</v>

462
00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:36.040
<v Speaker 1>Drag it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get the girl.</v>

463
00:23:36.041 --> 00:23:38.000
<v Speaker 1>That's the first thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But more importantly,</v>

464
00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:41.890
<v Speaker 1>you get something of value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a real transmutation.</v>

465
00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:45.890
<v Speaker 1>It's so interesting because what</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened was not only we figure out how</v>

466
00:23:45.891 --> 00:23:50.690
<v Speaker 1>to defend ourselves against predators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we figured out that going after them</v>

467
00:23:50.691 --> 00:23:54.380
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily was unbelievably useful</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you might ask,</v>

468
00:23:54.381 --> 00:23:55.640
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell transformed,</v>

469
00:23:56.210 --> 00:23:58.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frugivores into carnivores.</v>

470
00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:00.543
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

471
00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:03.890
<v Speaker 1>chimps will eat and they do hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will eat monkeys,</v>

472
00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:07.040
<v Speaker 1>but they primarily live on leaves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is pointless,</v>

473
00:24:07.041 --> 00:24:08.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the leaves have no calories</v>

474
00:24:08.691 --> 00:24:10.190
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

475
00:24:10.191 --> 00:24:13.880
<v Speaker 1>human beings like we got transformed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are primarily fruit eaters and we</v>

476
00:24:13.881 --> 00:24:16.370
<v Speaker 1>turned into hunters and we're thin and</v>
<v Speaker 1>fast,</v>

477
00:24:16.371 --> 00:24:21.371
<v Speaker 1>which is very unlike a chimpanzee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So not only were women selecting men who</v>

478
00:24:22.071 --> 00:24:25.520
<v Speaker 1>were able and willing to protect</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves against predators,</v>

479
00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:30.760
<v Speaker 1>but that got translated even farther</v>
<v Speaker 1>into selection for,</v>

480
00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:36.580
<v Speaker 1>for partners who would go out partly to</v>
<v Speaker 1>protect and partly also didn't want to</v>

481
00:24:36.741 --> 00:24:40.550
<v Speaker 1>bring something back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I know it's pretty,</v>

482
00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:42.800
<v Speaker 1>it's a pretty smart arrangement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All things considered.</v>

483
00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:44.200
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

484
00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:47.240
<v Speaker 1>one of the prices that women pay for</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is that they're partly selecting</v>

485
00:24:47.241 --> 00:24:49.400
<v Speaker 1>for male aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

486
00:24:49.401 --> 00:24:52.160
<v Speaker 1>because the males aren't going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to be able to do that</v>

487
00:24:52.161 --> 00:24:56.090
<v Speaker 1>sort of thing unless they're tough and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to go out and do it</v>

488
00:24:56.091 --> 00:24:57.890
<v Speaker 1>unless they're relatively fearless.</v>

489
00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:00.200
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you end up with a,</v>

490
00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:04.400
<v Speaker 1>you got this weird balance between</v>
<v Speaker 1>needing a semi Predator and needing</v>

491
00:25:04.401 --> 00:25:07.310
<v Speaker 1>someone who's going to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>integrate themselves into the household.</v>

492
00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:10.160
<v Speaker 1>So that's the beauty and the beast thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as I can tell.</v>

493
00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:11.990
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

494
00:25:11.991 --> 00:25:16.760
<v Speaker 1>So the law God says to the serpent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you've done this,</v>

495
00:25:16.761 --> 00:25:21.620
<v Speaker 1>you're cursed above all cattle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cattle were generally animals and above</v>

496
00:25:21.621 --> 00:25:24.740
<v Speaker 1>every beast of the field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>upon thy belly you will go and dust you</v>

497
00:25:24.741 --> 00:25:26.300
<v Speaker 1>will eat all the days of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

498
00:25:26.301 --> 00:25:29.600
<v Speaker 1>So the serpent scoped a problem there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

499
00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:35.360
<v Speaker 1>be interesting to find out exactly why</v>
<v Speaker 1>those damn things lost their legs</v>

500
00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:38.090
<v Speaker 1>because you know that snakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>snakes,</v>

501
00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:42.680
<v Speaker 1>lizards aren't snakes that grew legs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Snakes are lizards that lost their legs.</v>

502
00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:44.990
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why did the hell did they lose their</v>

503
00:25:44.991 --> 00:25:47.330
<v Speaker 1>legs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what was it about the specifics of</v>

504
00:25:47.331 --> 00:25:51.530
<v Speaker 1>their environment and their diet and</v>
<v Speaker 1>their locale that meant that legless</v>

505
00:25:51.531 --> 00:25:52.640
<v Speaker 1>movement was better?</v>

506
00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:53.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're sneakier,</v>

507
00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:55.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can slither through the grass,</v>

508
00:25:55.701 --> 00:25:58.430
<v Speaker 1>they can climb trees to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although he does do that,</v>

509
00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:02.510
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know enough about snakes to</v>
<v Speaker 1>know exactly why it was that they lost</v>

510
00:26:02.511 --> 00:26:06.410
<v Speaker 1>their legs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but be interesting to find out and unto</v>

511
00:26:06.411 --> 00:26:08.920
<v Speaker 1>the woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I will put enmity between Dow and</v>

512
00:26:08.921 --> 00:26:13.130
<v Speaker 1>the woman and between seed and her seed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt</v>

513
00:26:13.131 --> 00:26:14.240
<v Speaker 1>bruise his heel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

514
00:26:14.241 --> 00:26:17.930
<v Speaker 1>so it's just another representation of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that there's going to be enmity</v>

515
00:26:17.931 --> 00:26:22.931
<v Speaker 1>between human beings and predatory will</v>
<v Speaker 1>say predatory reptiles under the woman.</v>

516
00:26:23.571 --> 00:26:24.021
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

517
00:26:24.021 --> 00:26:26.600
<v Speaker 1>greatly multiply that I sorrow and thy</v>
<v Speaker 1>conception.</v>

518
00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:31.310
<v Speaker 1>That's not hard to figure out in sorrow</v>
<v Speaker 1>shalt thou bring forth children and thy</v>

519
00:26:31.311 --> 00:26:34.370
<v Speaker 1>desire shall be to thy husband and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>shall rule over thee.</v>

520
00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:39.500
<v Speaker 1>Notice that doesn't say should it just</v>
<v Speaker 1>says Shell,</v>

521
00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:41.210
<v Speaker 1>and that's not the same thing at all.</v>

522
00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:42.650
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a curse.</v>

523
00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:47.010
<v Speaker 1>It's not a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a proposition about how the</v>

524
00:26:47.011 --> 00:26:49.800
<v Speaker 1>world should be optimally structured.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's far different than not.</v>

525
00:26:49.801 --> 00:26:50.341
<v Speaker 1>It says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

526
00:26:50.341 --> 00:26:52.830
<v Speaker 1>there's been a sequence of events and</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is going to be the outcome.</v>

527
00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:56.430
<v Speaker 1>Childbirth is going to be hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be really difficult to</v>

528
00:26:56.850 --> 00:27:00.960
<v Speaker 1>raise children and you're going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>subject to the oppression of men.</v>

529
00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:01.681
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

530
00:27:01.681 --> 00:27:04.670
<v Speaker 1>well that's definitely what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then to Adam,</v>

531
00:27:04.671 --> 00:27:06.740
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you listened to your wife and</v>

532
00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:08.700
<v Speaker 1>ate of the tree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I told you not to,</v>

533
00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:13.200
<v Speaker 1>the ground is cursed for your sake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll eat it in sorrow all the days of</v>

534
00:27:13.201 --> 00:27:17.940
<v Speaker 1>your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll bring up thorns and thistles and</v>

535
00:27:17.941 --> 00:27:20.910
<v Speaker 1>you'll eat the herb of the field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the introduce deduction of the</v>

536
00:27:20.911 --> 00:27:22.770
<v Speaker 1>necessity of agriculture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

537
00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:26.130
<v Speaker 1>You're no longer living in a garden</v>
<v Speaker 1>where things are just growing for free.</v>

538
00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:28.950
<v Speaker 1>You're out there like dig in with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>stick and planting things,</v>

539
00:27:28.951 --> 00:27:31.080
<v Speaker 1>which is work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know when you think,</v>

540
00:27:31.081 --> 00:27:33.720
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do animals work and the answer that is</v>

541
00:27:33.721 --> 00:27:37.020
<v Speaker 1>no human beings work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The answer to that is yes.</v>

542
00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:40.710
<v Speaker 1>Why do human beings work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about because we discovered time,</v>

543
00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:44.610
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because work means why do you work while</v>

544
00:27:44.611 --> 00:27:46.560
<v Speaker 1>you worked for the future?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously,</v>

545
00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:50.040
<v Speaker 1>and you don't have the future unless</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've discovered time and you don't</v>

546
00:27:50.041 --> 00:27:52.140
<v Speaker 1>care about the future unless you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're vulnerable.</v>

547
00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:56.160
<v Speaker 1>So these things are tangled together and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the cost of self consciousness is</v>

548
00:27:56.161 --> 00:28:00.780
<v Speaker 1>that we're life becomes work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>life becomes suffering and work.</v>

549
00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:05.910
<v Speaker 1>So it doesn't necessarily seem like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly good deal in the sweat of</v>

550
00:28:05.911 --> 00:28:09.240
<v Speaker 1>value face you shall eat bread until you</v>
<v Speaker 1>return to the ground for out of it.</v>

551
00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:12.900
<v Speaker 1>You were taken for your dust and unto</v>
<v Speaker 1>dust you will return.</v>

552
00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:18.100
<v Speaker 1>And Adam called his wasting eve because</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was the mother of all living and add</v>

553
00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:22.350
<v Speaker 1>unto Adam also and to his wife did the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lord God make coats of skins and clothed</v>

554
00:28:22.351 --> 00:28:23.101
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So okay,</v>

555
00:28:23.101 --> 00:28:23.934
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

556
00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:26.670
<v Speaker 1>that's certainly part of the origin of</v>
<v Speaker 1>clothing,</v>

557
00:28:26.671 --> 00:28:28.530
<v Speaker 1>especially in the colder climates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

558
00:28:28.531 --> 00:28:32.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like you get the animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's a Predator and you wear it</v>

559
00:28:32.251 --> 00:28:33.540
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to begin with,</v>

560
00:28:33.541 --> 00:28:35.750
<v Speaker 1>we lived inside of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

561
00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:38.580
<v Speaker 1>So I suspect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I don't know this for sure,</v>

562
00:28:38.610 --> 00:28:42.660
<v Speaker 1>although I know it fairly well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the earliest dwellings were mammoth</v>

563
00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:47.580
<v Speaker 1>skins with mammoth bone poles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can see,</v>

564
00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:49.260
<v Speaker 1>see how that might've come about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

565
00:28:49.261 --> 00:28:50.640
<v Speaker 1>Because you're out there hunting a</v>
<v Speaker 1>mammoth.</v>

566
00:28:50.641 --> 00:28:53.220
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're living in a cave or</v>
<v Speaker 1>wherever the hell people live,</v>

567
00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:56.490
<v Speaker 1>or maybe you made something out of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

568
00:28:56.650 --> 00:29:00.300
<v Speaker 1>grasp Heidi and I don't know what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paleolithic people were living in,</v>

569
00:29:00.570 --> 00:29:01.710
<v Speaker 1>but it starts to get cold.</v>

570
00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:03.600
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the ice age starts creeping up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

571
00:29:03.601 --> 00:29:06.540
<v Speaker 1>And so you stab yourself a nice mammoth</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a storm comes up.</v>

572
00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:09.330
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you've skinned it out,</v>

573
00:29:09.331 --> 00:29:11.390
<v Speaker 1>at least in principle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you carry the meat home.</v>

574
00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:15.180
<v Speaker 1>The logical thing to do is to get the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hell underneath the skin and after a day</v>

575
00:29:15.181 --> 00:29:17.460
<v Speaker 1>or two in his throw them underneath</v>
<v Speaker 1>erotic mammas skin,</v>

576
00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:18.303
<v Speaker 1>you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

577
00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:22.320
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't be a bad idea to like do</v>
<v Speaker 1>something to the skin so that it's not</v>

578
00:29:22.321 --> 00:29:26.130
<v Speaker 1>quite as intolerable to live under as it</v>
<v Speaker 1>might be if that's a tent,</v>

579
00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:27.960
<v Speaker 1>like a tent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His skin with bones,</v>

580
00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:30.390
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the movement from that to this</v>

581
00:29:30.391 --> 00:29:31.680
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

582
00:29:31.681 --> 00:29:33.600
<v Speaker 1>it's a matter of degree rather than</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind.</v>

583
00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:38.490
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the Lord God sent the man and</v>

584
00:29:38.491 --> 00:29:41.860
<v Speaker 1>woman or the Lord God says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>behold the man is become one of us to</v>

585
00:29:41.861 --> 00:29:42.694
<v Speaker 1>know good and evil.</v>

586
00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:47.390
<v Speaker 1>So that's the sign of divinity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to know good and evil,</v>

587
00:29:47.391 --> 00:29:51.080
<v Speaker 1>to have a moral sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now lest he put forth his hand and</v>

588
00:29:51.081 --> 00:29:53.750
<v Speaker 1>take also of the tree of life and eat</v>
<v Speaker 1>and live forever.</v>

589
00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:58.130
<v Speaker 1>Therefore the Lord God sent him forth</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the garden of Eden to till the</v>

590
00:29:58.131 --> 00:30:01.160
<v Speaker 1>ground from whence he was taken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we drove out the man and he placed at</v>

591
00:30:01.161 --> 00:30:04.730
<v Speaker 1>the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a flaming sword which turned every</v>

592
00:30:04.731 --> 00:30:08.660
<v Speaker 1>way to keep the way of the tree of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

593
00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:10.970
<v Speaker 1>the last part of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to understand,</v>

594
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tree of life issue.</v>

595
00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:17.570
<v Speaker 1>So the idea there is that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's at least in principle,</v>

596
00:30:18.050 --> 00:30:22.030
<v Speaker 1>a substance capable of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what,</v>

597
00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:26.060
<v Speaker 1>of conferring and mortality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we don't have access to that.</v>

598
00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:28.240
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

599
00:30:28.250 --> 00:30:31.160
<v Speaker 1>part of the return to Eden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is also the movement towards</v>

600
00:30:31.161 --> 00:30:33.380
<v Speaker 1>heaven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is also the perfection of life,</v>

601
00:30:33.381 --> 00:30:37.340
<v Speaker 1>is to defeat death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously into find the elixir of</v>

602
00:30:37.341 --> 00:30:39.440
<v Speaker 1>immortality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which by the way was the goal of the</v>

603
00:30:39.441 --> 00:30:43.430
<v Speaker 1>entire l chemical pursuit and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>what turned into science and well,</v>

604
00:30:43.431 --> 00:30:45.560
<v Speaker 1>what's the goal of science?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

605
00:30:45.561 --> 00:30:48.470
<v Speaker 1>it's to make us healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wealthy and live,</v>

606
00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:50.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conceivably forever.</v>

607
00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:54.140
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like people aren't continually</v>

608
00:30:54.141 --> 00:30:56.480
<v Speaker 1>trying to get the fruit of the tree of</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

609
00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:58.460
<v Speaker 1>Now there's a lot more to it than that,</v>

610
00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:01.500
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ending of that,</v>

611
00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:04.680
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what you have there is the expulsion</v>

612
00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:08.280
<v Speaker 1>of human beings from an unconscious</v>
<v Speaker 1>paradise into history.</v>

613
00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:10.830
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly how the Bible is</v>
<v Speaker 1>structured.</v>

614
00:31:10.831 --> 00:31:14.460
<v Speaker 1>Like what happens is there's these</v>
<v Speaker 1>stories in genesis that are very,</v>

615
00:31:14.461 --> 00:31:16.770
<v Speaker 1>very old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the these stories.</v>

616
00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:19.770
<v Speaker 1>There's the story of Cain and Abel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the story of,</v>

617
00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:23.430
<v Speaker 1>of a Babel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tower of Babel.</v>

618
00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:27.660
<v Speaker 1>There's the story of Noah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then roughly speaking,</v>

619
00:31:27.661 --> 00:31:31.230
<v Speaker 1>although it happens a bit with no</v>
<v Speaker 1>history starts because then when you get</v>

620
00:31:31.290 --> 00:31:34.320
<v Speaker 1>past that you get to the post flood</v>
<v Speaker 1>period,</v>

621
00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:39.390
<v Speaker 1>select the pre flood period is so back</v>
<v Speaker 1>in prehistory that it's all archaic</v>

622
00:31:39.391 --> 00:31:43.440
<v Speaker 1>mythology and the post flood period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which basically starts with Abraham,</v>

623
00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:46.440
<v Speaker 1>starts to become a history of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture of Israel.</v>

624
00:31:46.441 --> 00:31:48.240
<v Speaker 1>So it's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually literally</v>

625
00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:54.870
<v Speaker 1>it's the history of a culture instead of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mythologizing nation of radical</v>

626
00:31:54.871 --> 00:31:57.420
<v Speaker 1>prehistory of the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

627
00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:01.320
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'll,</v>

628
00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:05.860
<v Speaker 1>I'll also just tell you briefly the Cain</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Abel story because we're there and</v>

629
00:32:05.861 --> 00:32:07.610
<v Speaker 1>we might as well do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is,</v>

630
00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:09.110
<v Speaker 1>this story is</v>

631
00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:17.790
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking 12 sentences long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

632
00:32:17.791 --> 00:32:19.170
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So adamant.</v>

633
00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:24.330
<v Speaker 1>Any habit child came and add and eve</v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

634
00:32:25.501 --> 00:32:27.360
<v Speaker 1>I have gotten a man from the Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

635
00:32:27.361 --> 00:32:30.900
<v Speaker 1>she bore his brother Abel and Abel was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>keeper of sheep,</v>

636
00:32:30.901 --> 00:32:35.040
<v Speaker 1>but Cain was a tiller of the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's some antagonism between the,</v>

637
00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:37.620
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shepherds and the farmers.</v>

638
00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:40.870
<v Speaker 1>And that's like there's always an</v>
<v Speaker 1>between shepherds and farmers because of</v>

639
00:32:40.871 --> 00:32:44.000
<v Speaker 1>the shepherds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sheep to graze all over the place.</v>

640
00:32:44.001 --> 00:32:46.880
<v Speaker 1>And that farmers want the shape to stay</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hell out of the,</v>

641
00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:49.430
<v Speaker 1>out of the fields,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

642
00:32:49.431 --> 00:32:51.560
<v Speaker 1>and that was all played out again in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>American west.</v>

643
00:32:51.561 --> 00:32:53.360
<v Speaker 1>There was huge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

644
00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:56.750
<v Speaker 1>conflict between the farmers and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ranchers for exactly the same reason.</v>

645
00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:00.530
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it came in process of time.</v>

646
00:33:00.531 --> 00:33:03.230
<v Speaker 1>It came to pass that cain brought of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fruit of the ground,</v>

647
00:33:03.231 --> 00:33:04.520
<v Speaker 1>an offering unto the Lord.</v>

648
00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:06.320
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is a strange thing.</v>

649
00:33:06.321 --> 00:33:09.740
<v Speaker 1>So we've already talked about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>discovery of time and the necessity for</v>

650
00:33:09.741 --> 00:33:10.940
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

651
00:33:10.941 --> 00:33:11.774
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

652
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:15.560
<v Speaker 1>we don't exactly know how people</v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize if those ideas.</v>

653
00:33:15.561 --> 00:33:18.230
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like they were cave men are</v>
<v Speaker 1>all sitting around the fire one day and</v>

654
00:33:18.231 --> 00:33:18.681
<v Speaker 1>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

655
00:33:18.681 --> 00:33:21.500
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just discovered tomorrow we should do</v>

656
00:33:21.501 --> 00:33:23.180
<v Speaker 1>something about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should get to work.</v>

657
00:33:23.181 --> 00:33:26.990
<v Speaker 1>It was God only knows how that happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It came out of the inarticulate,</v>

658
00:33:27.290 --> 00:33:31.970
<v Speaker 1>biological substructure that is our past</v>
<v Speaker 1>and started to manifest itself.</v>

659
00:33:31.971 --> 00:33:34.460
<v Speaker 1>God only knows and imaginative ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of those,</v>

660
00:33:34.461 --> 00:33:37.220
<v Speaker 1>imagine that the ideas is the idea of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sacrifice.</v>

661
00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:39.590
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the conceptualization of God.</v>

662
00:33:39.591 --> 00:33:43.670
<v Speaker 1>The father as that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which extends across time and judges,</v>

663
00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:48.470
<v Speaker 1>then you make sacrificial offerings to</v>
<v Speaker 1>that which could be of your labor.</v>

664
00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:52.100
<v Speaker 1>This is the fruits of your labor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the difference is trivial.</v>

665
00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:53.900
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look what I've done.</v>

666
00:33:53.901 --> 00:33:56.180
<v Speaker 1>Is this good enough for you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And believe me,</v>

667
00:33:56.181 --> 00:33:58.160
<v Speaker 1>you guys are asking that question all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

668
00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:01.850
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's just nonstop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this good enough?</v>

669
00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:04.190
<v Speaker 1>Is this good enough?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this sacrifice enough,</v>

670
00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:06.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what are you hoping for while you're</v>

671
00:34:06.081 --> 00:34:08.120
<v Speaker 1>hoping for the blessings of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

672
00:34:08.121 --> 00:34:09.890
<v Speaker 1>I would say for all intents and</v>
<v Speaker 1>purposes,</v>

673
00:34:09.891 --> 00:34:11.990
<v Speaker 1>you're hoping for the blessings of God</v>
<v Speaker 1>the father.</v>

674
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:14.420
<v Speaker 1>Now you might think about it in pure</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural terms.</v>

675
00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:17.780
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From a psychological perspective,</v>

676
00:34:17.781 --> 00:34:22.070
<v Speaker 1>it hardly makes any difference at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The point is is that to conceptualize</v>

677
00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:26.810
<v Speaker 1>culture across time as a judgmental male</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a really smart idea.</v>

678
00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:28.460
<v Speaker 1>It's a really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really smart idea.</v>

679
00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:31.640
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it's just judgmental mail that</v>

680
00:34:31.641 --> 00:34:33.440
<v Speaker 1>you have to make offerings to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

681
00:34:33.441 --> 00:34:33.891
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

682
00:34:33.891 --> 00:34:36.200
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty much exactly right.</v>

683
00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:38.390
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's what's happening and so people</v>

684
00:34:38.391 --> 00:34:39.170
<v Speaker 1>are acting this out.</v>

685
00:34:39.170 --> 00:34:44.170
<v Speaker 1>You have to make sacrifices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cane brings some vegetables and fruit</v>

686
00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:46.000
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

687
00:34:46.001 --> 00:34:47.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>able brings no,</v>

688
00:34:47.331 --> 00:34:51.710
<v Speaker 1>he brings like some lamps and these are</v>
<v Speaker 1>the high quality labs right there,</v>

689
00:34:51.711 --> 00:34:56.711
<v Speaker 1>the choice cuts and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know that partly because the</v>

690
00:34:56.961 --> 00:34:59.690
<v Speaker 1>firstling of the flock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's the first born,</v>

691
00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:01.820
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say lambs,</v>

692
00:35:02.090 --> 00:35:05.510
<v Speaker 1>they're there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had a reputation as the most</v>

693
00:35:05.511 --> 00:35:08.990
<v Speaker 1>valuable and partly because of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>firstborn son was the most valuable.</v>

694
00:35:08.991 --> 00:35:12.890
<v Speaker 1>It's the same kind of idea and there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>reason the first born son was most</v>

695
00:35:12.891 --> 00:35:16.940
<v Speaker 1>valuable and part of the reason is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that unless you give all your land to</v>

696
00:35:16.941 --> 00:35:21.941
<v Speaker 1>one of your children by 12 generations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of your offspring are living on</v>

697
00:35:21.951 --> 00:35:25.670
<v Speaker 1>something the size of a postage stamp</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're all starving to death.</v>

698
00:35:25.970 --> 00:35:29.480
<v Speaker 1>So it's unfair in a sense that it only</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes to the firstborn son.</v>

699
00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:34.070
<v Speaker 1>But if it's an agricultural community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no better solution.</v>

700
00:35:34.070 --> 00:35:36.670
<v Speaker 1>And then at least you can tell your</v>
<v Speaker 1>second born son like,</v>

701
00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:37.900
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

702
00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:39.490
<v Speaker 1>you're a fine guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

703
00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:42.300
<v Speaker 1>it would be wonderful if you could get</v>
<v Speaker 1>something but you don't get it.</v>

704
00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:45.330
<v Speaker 1>And it's not your fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a mindful leader.</v>

705
00:35:45.331 --> 00:35:48.780
<v Speaker 1>It's just that's just the rule and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good deal for everybody.</v>

706
00:35:48.781 --> 00:35:49.980
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't get the farm,</v>

707
00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:53.160
<v Speaker 1>you have to go make your own way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at least there's no enmity</v>

708
00:35:53.161 --> 00:35:55.890
<v Speaker 1>associated with it necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

709
00:35:55.891 --> 00:36:00.891
<v Speaker 1>cane makes this offering that looks like</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about equality and God is happy</v>

710
00:36:02.461 --> 00:36:07.290
<v Speaker 1>about that</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Lord had respect unto Abel and</v>

711
00:36:07.291 --> 00:36:08.580
<v Speaker 1>to his offering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the book,</v>

712
00:36:08.610 --> 00:36:12.090
<v Speaker 1>the story that makes this ambiguous say</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can kind of guess that the reason</v>

713
00:36:12.091 --> 00:36:14.970
<v Speaker 1>that Abel gets away with it is because</v>
<v Speaker 1>while a,</v>

714
00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:17.250
<v Speaker 1>he's bringing neat rather than</v>
<v Speaker 1>vegetables.</v>

715
00:36:17.251 --> 00:36:18.600
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's higher quality,</v>

716
00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:20.970
<v Speaker 1>much more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much more nutrient dense.</v>

717
00:36:20.970 --> 00:36:25.560
<v Speaker 1>It's much higher quality offering a food</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it's also the of the meat.</v>

718
00:36:25.561 --> 00:36:28.890
<v Speaker 1>It's the highest quality and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the next thing that happens is</v>

719
00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:31.500
<v Speaker 1>it's acceptable to God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

720
00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:34.890
<v Speaker 1>it might be the enabled just got it</v>
<v Speaker 1>right and God was happy or maybe God's</v>

721
00:36:34.891 --> 00:36:38.260
<v Speaker 1>happy about able for some completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary reason it out it and it</v>

722
00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:41.910
<v Speaker 1>actually doesn't matter at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get value out of both</v>

723
00:36:41.911 --> 00:36:43.200
<v Speaker 1>interpretations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

724
00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:47.250
<v Speaker 1>I would say to err on the safe side that</v>
<v Speaker 1>offered the most valuable things is</v>

725
00:36:47.251 --> 00:36:50.500
<v Speaker 1>probably your best bet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is an art.</v>

726
00:36:50.530 --> 00:36:53.970
<v Speaker 1>There's some respect for the arbitrary</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature of God to hear too.</v>

727
00:36:53.971 --> 00:36:57.840
<v Speaker 1>You can't exactly be sure why he's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>happy with Kane.</v>

728
00:36:58.290 --> 00:37:00.750
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter until Cain and his</v>

729
00:37:00.751 --> 00:37:03.540
<v Speaker 1>offering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had not respect and Cain was very</v>

730
00:37:03.541 --> 00:37:06.600
<v Speaker 1>wroth angry that his and his countenance</v>
<v Speaker 1>fall.</v>

731
00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:08.820
<v Speaker 1>So like this is a permanent</v>
<v Speaker 1>disappointment for him.</v>

732
00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:10.880
<v Speaker 1>He's angry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>resentful,</v>

733
00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:13.050
<v Speaker 1>unhappy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>miserable.</v>

734
00:37:13.830 --> 00:37:16.680
<v Speaker 1>All of those things he's failing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it says.</v>

735
00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:19.050
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if God isn't pleased by his</v>

736
00:37:19.051 --> 00:37:21.510
<v Speaker 1>offerings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens is he's failing and this</v>

737
00:37:21.511 --> 00:37:24.990
<v Speaker 1>makes him very angry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the Lord says,</v>

738
00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:26.730
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's up with you?</v>

739
00:37:26.731 --> 00:37:30.180
<v Speaker 1>Why are you angry and why has your face</v>
<v Speaker 1>fallen the way it has?</v>

740
00:37:30.810 --> 00:37:32.490
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says more,</v>

741
00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:35.400
<v Speaker 1>and this is where it gets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems.</v>

742
00:37:35.401 --> 00:37:38.850
<v Speaker 1>The story seems to reveal that this</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually has something to do with Kane</v>

743
00:37:38.851 --> 00:37:41.670
<v Speaker 1>rather than something to do with God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So God says,</v>

744
00:37:41.730 --> 00:37:43.770
<v Speaker 1>if you do well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>won't you be accepted?</v>

745
00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:45.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that implies he wasn't doing well.</v>

746
00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:50.430
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't do well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's your fault.</v>

747
00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:53.370
<v Speaker 1>And so God is saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

748
00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:55.950
<v Speaker 1>don't bring your damn problems to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>buck.</v>

749
00:37:55.951 --> 00:37:56.491
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

750
00:37:56.491 --> 00:37:59.580
<v Speaker 1>if this isn't working out for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because you're just not doing it</v>

751
00:37:59.581 --> 00:38:00.250
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

752
00:38:00.250 --> 00:38:02.130
<v Speaker 1>You know you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not into this properly,</v>

753
00:38:02.131 --> 00:38:05.580
<v Speaker 1>you're not doing well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also you're blending things that</v>

754
00:38:05.581 --> 00:38:08.250
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be blamed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there's an interesting part of this.</v>

755
00:38:08.370 --> 00:38:13.050
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way that the story is sin lies at</v>

756
00:38:13.051 --> 00:38:16.110
<v Speaker 1>your door was told,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was told in a metaphorical structure</v>

757
00:38:16.111 --> 00:38:20.940
<v Speaker 1>and sin was something that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualized as I lustful predatory</v>

758
00:38:20.941 --> 00:38:25.560
<v Speaker 1>animal like a cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it was probably at Kane's door.</v>

759
00:38:25.561 --> 00:38:28.980
<v Speaker 1>That's the metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the idea is that cane allows this</v>

760
00:38:28.981 --> 00:38:33.981
<v Speaker 1>thing in to have intercourse with him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's this participation in like a</v>

761
00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:39.070
<v Speaker 1>sexualized merger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a,</v>

762
00:38:39.130 --> 00:38:42.170
<v Speaker 1>there's an implication there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the implication is not only is</v>

763
00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:46.000
<v Speaker 1>there's sin out the door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but cain invites it in.</v>

764
00:38:46.510 --> 00:38:50.350
<v Speaker 1>And how's it creative relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an intimately creative relationship</v>

765
00:38:50.351 --> 00:38:53.500
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's ridiculously smart because</v>

766
00:38:53.530 --> 00:38:57.860
<v Speaker 1>that's what happens if people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>resentful because their offerings were</v>

767
00:38:57.910 --> 00:39:00.700
<v Speaker 1>either second rate or got rejected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

768
00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:03.160
<v Speaker 1>one of the pathways is first they get</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

769
00:39:03.161 --> 00:39:06.460
<v Speaker 1>very angry and their accountant is false</v>
<v Speaker 1>or they're resentful and hostile and</v>

770
00:39:06.461 --> 00:39:07.720
<v Speaker 1>then the next thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

771
00:39:07.721 --> 00:39:12.721
<v Speaker 1>the little resentful fantasy start to</v>
<v Speaker 1>emerge and instead of thinking,</v>

772
00:39:12.791 --> 00:39:15.730
<v Speaker 1>Huh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not a very productive way to go</v>

773
00:39:15.731 --> 00:39:16.990
<v Speaker 1>because it is like a door.</v>

774
00:39:17.410 --> 00:39:18.410
<v Speaker 1>They think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

775
00:39:18.490 --> 00:39:20.350
<v Speaker 1>let's just see where we can go with</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

776
00:39:20.351 --> 00:39:22.240
<v Speaker 1>And like after five or six years of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

777
00:39:22.241 --> 00:39:24.940
<v Speaker 1>you're in a prime position to go shoot</v>
<v Speaker 1>up Dawson College.</v>

778
00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:28.630
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can go very far down that rabbit</v>

779
00:39:28.631 --> 00:39:29.650
<v Speaker 1>hole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

780
00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:34.000
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's clearly motivated by the rejection</v>

781
00:39:34.001 --> 00:39:36.220
<v Speaker 1>of the fruits of your being by</v>
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>

782
00:39:36.221 --> 00:39:37.750
<v Speaker 1>That's how you're going to interpret it</v>

783
00:39:39.830 --> 00:39:40.663
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

784
00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:43.870
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then so,</v>

785
00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:46.480
<v Speaker 1>so kane obviously he's not happy with</v>
<v Speaker 1>that response.</v>

786
00:39:46.481 --> 00:39:49.750
<v Speaker 1>Not In the least because it says exactly</v>
<v Speaker 1>the opposite of what he would like it to</v>

787
00:39:49.751 --> 00:39:50.290
<v Speaker 1>say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

788
00:39:50.290 --> 00:39:52.390
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's his own fault that he could do</v>

789
00:39:52.391 --> 00:39:55.720
<v Speaker 1>something about it and then he doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>get to blame being and God,</v>

790
00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:01.430
<v Speaker 1>so ken goes and has a chat with Abel and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it came to pass when they were in the</v>

791
00:40:01.431 --> 00:40:04.340
<v Speaker 1>field that Cain rose up against Abel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his brother and killed him.</v>

792
00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:07.730
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first story about real human beings</v>

793
00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:12.380
<v Speaker 1>in the Bible is a murder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a fratricide and it's.</v>

794
00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:15.560
<v Speaker 1>It's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the antagonistic brothers,</v>

795
00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:18.770
<v Speaker 1>one who is an archetype of good that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>able,</v>

796
00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:21.980
<v Speaker 1>the others who have an archetype of evil</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those develop across time.</v>

797
00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:24.650
<v Speaker 1>It's an it's an echoing or appreciate</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

798
00:40:24.690 --> 00:40:28.100
<v Speaker 1>That's another way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the battle between Christ and Satan,</v>

799
00:40:28.101 --> 00:40:32.840
<v Speaker 1>because those are more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are more purely archetipal figures</v>

800
00:40:32.841 --> 00:40:35.750
<v Speaker 1>and much more fleshed out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the earliest manifestation of</v>

801
00:40:35.751 --> 00:40:38.690
<v Speaker 1>that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hostile brothers and what you get.</v>

802
00:40:38.691 --> 00:40:43.691
<v Speaker 1>It's so sophisticated because basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it says is that if you do badly or</v>

803
00:40:44.271 --> 00:40:49.271
<v Speaker 1>you work hard either way and God rejects</v>
<v Speaker 1>your offerings and you become angry and</v>

804
00:40:49.761 --> 00:40:51.950
<v Speaker 1>resentful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing you're going to do is go</v>

805
00:40:51.951 --> 00:40:55.190
<v Speaker 1>after the best thing you could possibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine and do your best to wipe it out</v>

806
00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:56.631
<v Speaker 1>and you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

807
00:40:56.631 --> 00:40:57.710
<v Speaker 1>why would you do that?</v>

808
00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:59.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's a bunch of reasons,</v>

809
00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:01.310
<v Speaker 1>well first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would feel good.</v>

810
00:41:01.730 --> 00:41:05.060
<v Speaker 1>Second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get revenge against God because of</v>

811
00:41:05.061 --> 00:41:07.550
<v Speaker 1>course this is God's favorite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you can take him out of the</v>

812
00:41:07.551 --> 00:41:09.170
<v Speaker 1>equation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like that's a great deal.</v>

813
00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:12.470
<v Speaker 1>Third,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ideal against which you're</v>

814
00:41:12.471 --> 00:41:16.880
<v Speaker 1>negatively contrasting yourself is now</v>
<v Speaker 1>gone because that's the problem with</v>

815
00:41:16.881 --> 00:41:19.310
<v Speaker 1>having an ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have an ideal,</v>

816
00:41:19.370 --> 00:41:24.370
<v Speaker 1>then you're unworthy and it that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you think the ideal is attainable or</v>

817
00:41:24.441 --> 00:41:27.170
<v Speaker 1>even if you can move towards it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if all of a sudden the ideal is</v>

818
00:41:27.171 --> 00:41:31.400
<v Speaker 1>unattainable and you're sort of cast</v>
<v Speaker 1>among the damned the probability that</v>

819
00:41:31.401 --> 00:41:33.020
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be able to view that</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideal.</v>

820
00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:37.280
<v Speaker 1>Anything other than your enemy is very</v>
<v Speaker 1>low and so cain kills them,</v>

821
00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:41.690
<v Speaker 1>so that's interesting because that</v>
<v Speaker 1>really means that's the end of it.</v>

822
00:41:41.691 --> 00:41:44.630
<v Speaker 1>For cain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's destroyed his own ideal.</v>

823
00:41:45.170 --> 00:41:46.310
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you live then?</v>

824
00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:48.260
<v Speaker 1>How do you live?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you've destroyed your own ideal,</v>

825
00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:51.620
<v Speaker 1>you've got nowhere to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so kane is so angry that he's</v>

826
00:41:51.621 --> 00:41:55.080
<v Speaker 1>willing to destroy his own ideal to</v>
<v Speaker 1>obtain revenge and and,</v>

827
00:41:55.081 --> 00:41:55.914
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's</v>

828
00:41:57.650 --> 00:42:02.650
<v Speaker 1>12 lines story right at the beginning of</v>
<v Speaker 1>history and that's the layout for the</v>

829
00:42:04.251 --> 00:42:05.960
<v Speaker 1>spirit of humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says,</v>

830
00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:09.140
<v Speaker 1>we became self conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our eyes open,</v>

831
00:42:09.141 --> 00:42:11.890
<v Speaker 1>we became self conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We recognized our vulnerability and an</v>

832
00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:16.340
<v Speaker 1>attempt to overcome that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We started to work and sacrifice,</v>

833
00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:18.830
<v Speaker 1>but the problem with that is sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 1>that didn't work.</v>

834
00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:21.620
<v Speaker 1>Maybe because God was feeling</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly arbitrary that day or</v>

835
00:42:21.621 --> 00:42:23.570
<v Speaker 1>because we're kind of useless either</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

836
00:42:23.571 --> 00:42:27.050
<v Speaker 1>When it doesn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not good because it's our only</v>

837
00:42:27.350 --> 00:42:29.660
<v Speaker 1>remaining defense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then what?</v>

838
00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:32.900
<v Speaker 1>Well then it's a choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more,</v>

839
00:42:32.930 --> 00:42:35.210
<v Speaker 1>it's more choice right there between</v>
<v Speaker 1>good and evil.</v>

840
00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:37.190
<v Speaker 1>And that's all foreshadowed in the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

841
00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:42.350
<v Speaker 1>So now I'll add one more thing to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It took me a long time to figure out,</v>

842
00:42:42.351 --> 00:42:42.741
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

843
00:42:42.741 --> 00:42:45.890
<v Speaker 1>what the hell is the connection between</v>
<v Speaker 1>the knowledge of good and evil and</v>

844
00:42:45.891 --> 00:42:49.100
<v Speaker 1>nakedness and vulnerability and an</v>
<v Speaker 1>awareness,</v>

845
00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:51.560
<v Speaker 1>and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

846
00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:55.160
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's production and there's evil,</v>

847
00:42:56.810 --> 00:42:59.360
<v Speaker 1>so the lion kills the foreign and eats</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

848
00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:01.550
<v Speaker 1>It's rough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a tragedy.</v>

849
00:43:05.490 --> 00:43:08.390
<v Speaker 1>Do you capture an enemy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you keep them alive for three</v>

850
00:43:08.391 --> 00:43:13.010
<v Speaker 1>weeks in pain before you kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot more there than tragedy</v>

851
00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:16.070
<v Speaker 1>that's malevolence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he might say,</v>

852
00:43:16.071 --> 00:43:17.780
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is it that you can come up with</v>

853
00:43:17.781 --> 00:43:20.480
<v Speaker 1>malevolence?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say as soon as your self</v>

854
00:43:20.481 --> 00:43:22.560
<v Speaker 1>conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can come up with malevolence because</v>

855
00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:26.120
<v Speaker 1>if I know how I'm vulnerable and I know</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're like me,</v>

856
00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:30.590
<v Speaker 1>all I have to do is figure out what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>worst possible thing would be for me and</v>

857
00:43:30.591 --> 00:43:35.030
<v Speaker 1>then I can do it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you don't get the knowledge of</v>

858
00:43:35.031 --> 00:43:40.031
<v Speaker 1>self conscious vulnerability without</v>
<v Speaker 1>instantly also obtaining the Norwich of</v>

859
00:43:40.371 --> 00:43:43.610
<v Speaker 1>the difference between good and evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's also another thing that</v>

860
00:43:43.611 --> 00:43:47.150
<v Speaker 1>really distinguishes people because we</v>
<v Speaker 1>can do things that are so terrible that</v>

861
00:43:47.151 --> 00:43:51.470
<v Speaker 1>they make any of the things that animals</v>
<v Speaker 1>do look positively forgivable.</v>

862
00:43:52.490 --> 00:43:56.870
<v Speaker 1>So you know that long without self</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness comes this tremendous</v>

863
00:43:56.871 --> 00:44:01.871
<v Speaker 1>widening of the capacity for fracture</v>
<v Speaker 1>from just natural tragedy,</v>

864
00:44:02.901 --> 00:44:07.010
<v Speaker 1>let's say just natural life to this</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole spectrum of the ultimate in good</v>

865
00:44:07.011 --> 00:44:09.860
<v Speaker 1>and the ultimate evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then as soon as that happens,</v>

866
00:44:09.861 --> 00:44:13.340
<v Speaker 1>the first thing we have is a display of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that in in dramatic form.</v>

867
00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:15.500
<v Speaker 1>And that's the Cain and Abel Story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

868
00:44:15.590 --> 00:44:18.800
<v Speaker 1>interestingly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is the last thing that I'll</v>

869
00:44:18.801 --> 00:44:21.270
<v Speaker 1>tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God doesn't kill Cain.</v>

870
00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:26.420
<v Speaker 1>We can talk about why that is later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But cain has children and s and keynes</v>

871
00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:30.890
<v Speaker 1>descendants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think three generations down.</v>

872
00:44:31.650 --> 00:44:34.630
<v Speaker 1>So if you killed one again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sons,</v>

873
00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:37.020
<v Speaker 1>he killed seven of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They kill seven of you.</v>

874
00:44:37.410 --> 00:44:39.720
<v Speaker 1>And if you kill one of keynes</v>
<v Speaker 1>grandchildren,</v>

875
00:44:39.721 --> 00:44:44.660
<v Speaker 1>then they killed 49 of you and then and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so forth until you get to this guy named</v>

876
00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:48.000
<v Speaker 1>Tubal Kane who is either the grandson or</v>
<v Speaker 1>the great grandson.</v>

877
00:44:48.001 --> 00:44:50.550
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember which.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in tradition,</v>

878
00:44:50.551 --> 00:44:52.830
<v Speaker 1>he's the first person who makes weapons</v>
<v Speaker 1>of war.</v>

879
00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:59.600
<v Speaker 1>So there's this idea that the sacrifice</v>
<v Speaker 1>fails and that produces this descent</v>

880
00:44:59.911 --> 00:45:04.911
<v Speaker 1>into murderous resentment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that can amplify across a</v>

881
00:45:05.731 --> 00:45:10.560
<v Speaker 1>culture and possess more and more people</v>
<v Speaker 1>until what happens is it finally erupts</v>

882
00:45:10.561 --> 00:45:12.090
<v Speaker 1>in full,</v>
<v Speaker 1>full scale war.</v>

883
00:45:12.330 --> 00:45:14.130
<v Speaker 1>And that's more than territoriality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

884
00:45:14.131 --> 00:45:18.210
<v Speaker 1>It's more than a territorial dispute</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can understand territorial</v>

885
00:45:18.211 --> 00:45:20.670
<v Speaker 1>disputes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is territorial dispute with</v>

886
00:45:20.671 --> 00:45:22.530
<v Speaker 1>malevolence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

887
00:45:22.531 --> 00:45:23.850
<v Speaker 1>that's something that you,</v>

888
00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:28.660
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't need any explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

889
00:45:28.730 --> 00:45:30.320
<v Speaker 1>everyone understands what that is.</v>
