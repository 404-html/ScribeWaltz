1
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.320
<v Speaker 1>Hi everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Happy New Year.</v>

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:05.933
<v Speaker 1>I've got some things to say to junior </v>
<v Speaker 1>high and high school students and their </v>

3
00:00:09.301 --> 00:00:10.134
<v Speaker 1>parents about the politicization that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>occurring in the public school system </v>

4
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.490
<v Speaker 1>and what should be done about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have some very radical suggestions,</v>

5
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.070
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I am not putting forth lightly.</v>

6
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.493
<v Speaker 1>I think that it is time for public </v>
<v Speaker 1>school students and their parents to </v>

7
00:00:28.681 --> 00:00:29.514
<v Speaker 1>actively rebel against the </v>
<v Speaker 1>indoctrination that is being offered in </v>

8
00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:33.834
<v Speaker 1>the guise of education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But before such a recommendation can be </v>

9
00:00:37.591 --> 00:00:41.100
<v Speaker 1>reasonably offered or considered by its </v>
<v Speaker 1>recipients.</v>

10
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.480
<v Speaker 1>Some careful argumentation and review of</v>
<v Speaker 1>recent events is in order,</v>

11
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.010
<v Speaker 1>so please bear with me while I walk </v>
<v Speaker 1>through that process.</v>

12
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.150
<v Speaker 1>It's important to get these things right</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not to rush.</v>

13
00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.560
<v Speaker 1>About a year ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually on September 27th,</v>

14
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:01.463
<v Speaker 1>2016 I made a series of videos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them criticized a new piece of </v>

15
00:01:06.091 --> 00:01:10.480
<v Speaker 1>federal legislation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill see 16 bill [inaudible] is,</v>

16
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.333
<v Speaker 1>and I'm reading this directly from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government website and act to amend the </v>

17
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.580
<v Speaker 1>Canadian Human Rights Act and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>criminal code.</v>

18
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.470
<v Speaker 1>Here's the summary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This enactment amends the Canadian Human</v>

19
00:01:22.471 --> 00:01:23.304
<v Speaker 1>Rights Act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To add gender identity and gender </v>

20
00:01:24.841 --> 00:01:28.200
<v Speaker 1>expression to the list of prohibited </v>
<v Speaker 1>grounds of discrimination.</v>

21
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.843
<v Speaker 1>The enactment also amends the criminal </v>
<v Speaker 1>code to extend the protection against </v>

22
00:01:33.031 --> 00:01:33.864
<v Speaker 1>hate propaganda set out in that act to </v>
<v Speaker 1>any section of the public that is </v>

23
00:01:38.101 --> 00:01:38.934
<v Speaker 1>distinguished by gender identity or </v>
<v Speaker 1>expression and to clearly set out that </v>

24
00:01:43.471 --> 00:01:46.770
<v Speaker 1>evidence that an offense was motivated </v>
<v Speaker 1>by bias,</v>

25
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.873
<v Speaker 1>prejudice or hate based on gender </v>
<v Speaker 1>identity or expression constitutes an </v>

26
00:01:51.781 --> 00:01:52.614
<v Speaker 1>aggravating circumstance that a court </v>
<v Speaker 1>must take into consideration when it </v>

27
00:01:55.981 --> 00:01:56.814
<v Speaker 1>imposes a sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you may notice on careful reading </v>

28
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.420
<v Speaker 1>that the act modifies the criminal code </v>
<v Speaker 1>to clearly set out that evidence that an</v>

29
00:02:07.141 --> 00:02:12.141
<v Speaker 1>old fence was motivated by bias.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Prejudice or hate extends the purview of</v>

30
00:02:12.631 --> 00:02:17.070
<v Speaker 1>what might constitute hate to a degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's I think completely unacceptable,</v>

31
00:02:17.071 --> 00:02:19.650
<v Speaker 1>but that's the least of the problems </v>
<v Speaker 1>with this bill.</v>

32
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.980
<v Speaker 1>You can't really tell what the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems are though,</v>

33
00:02:22.981 --> 00:02:23.814
<v Speaker 1>unless you go read the policy guidelines</v>
<v Speaker 1>that were established by the Ontario </v>

34
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:28.553
<v Speaker 1>Human Rights Commission,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which already guide interpretation of </v>

35
00:02:29.731 --> 00:02:30.564
<v Speaker 1>similar legislation in Ontario and would</v>
<v Speaker 1>be used by the federal government's own </v>

36
00:02:33.811 --> 00:02:37.210
<v Speaker 1>admission to guide the interpretation of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill [inaudible].</v>

37
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.210
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I made the videos,</v>

38
00:02:39.211 --> 00:02:40.044
<v Speaker 1>I said as much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said that there were two fundamental </v>

39
00:02:42.211 --> 00:02:43.044
<v Speaker 1>dangers to this bill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One was that because of the Ontario </v>

40
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.920
<v Speaker 1>Human Rights Commission is a radical and</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous organization bent on producing</v>

41
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.833
<v Speaker 1>the most punitive possible policies in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the pursuit of its radical neo Marxist </v>

42
00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.390
<v Speaker 1>postmodern agenda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the legislation would introduce the</v>

43
00:03:04.391 --> 00:03:05.224
<v Speaker 1>possibility of persecution or let's say </v>
<v Speaker 1>prosecution for so-called offenses that </v>

44
00:03:09.971 --> 00:03:14.560
<v Speaker 1>should never be considered within the </v>
<v Speaker 1>proper domain of legal prosecution.</v>

45
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.453
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also objected to the manner in which </v>

46
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.280
<v Speaker 1>the relationship between biological sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gender identity,</v>

47
00:03:21.281 --> 00:03:22.114
<v Speaker 1>gender expression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sexual orientation was written into </v>

48
00:03:24.821 --> 00:03:25.654
<v Speaker 1>the Ontario Human Rights Commission's </v>
<v Speaker 1>policies and therefore essentially into </v>

49
00:03:28.121 --> 00:03:28.954
<v Speaker 1>the law pointing out that the law now </v>
<v Speaker 1>demands that we consider those four </v>

50
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.843
<v Speaker 1>different phenomena as essentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>independent when they are in fact very </v>

51
00:03:37.421 --> 00:03:38.254
<v Speaker 1>tightly causally linked and as well that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the claim that's being made both </v>

52
00:03:42.461 --> 00:03:47.260
<v Speaker 1>implicit and explicit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that those four sets of phenomena differ</v>

53
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.560
<v Speaker 1>within each strata as a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>socialization,</v>

54
00:03:50.561 --> 00:03:51.394
<v Speaker 1>in fact is also wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also undermines the primary </v>

55
00:03:54.041 --> 00:03:54.874
<v Speaker 1>arguments that transsexual people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>gay people used to buttress the reality </v>

56
00:04:00.641 --> 00:04:01.630
<v Speaker 1>of the our identity.</v>

57
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:02.553
<v Speaker 1>Namely that they have a biological </v>
<v Speaker 1>proclivity that directs them towards </v>

58
00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.290
<v Speaker 1>such identities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>expressions,</v>

59
00:04:08.291 --> 00:04:09.124
<v Speaker 1>and orientations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I pointed all of those things out and </v>

60
00:04:11.771 --> 00:04:12.604
<v Speaker 1>that we were in danger of legislating </v>
<v Speaker 1>compelled speech in relationship to </v>

61
00:04:15.821 --> 00:04:16.654
<v Speaker 1>preferred pronouns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are the pronouns that people who </v>

62
00:04:18.971 --> 00:04:19.804
<v Speaker 1>vary in their gender identity </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothetically want to use to be </v>

63
00:04:22.301 --> 00:04:23.134
<v Speaker 1>referred to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I pointed out that we were in danger of </v>

64
00:04:25.601 --> 00:04:29.080
<v Speaker 1>making compelled speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something required in Canada so that for</v>

65
00:04:29.081 --> 00:04:32.260
<v Speaker 1>the first time in our history and in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>history of the British common law,</v>

66
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.350
<v Speaker 1>the government would be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>legislate the content of your speech,</v>

67
00:04:35.351 --> 00:04:38.440
<v Speaker 1>which is quite different than </v>
<v Speaker 1>legislating what you can't say,</v>

68
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.780
<v Speaker 1>which is already something that's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous.</v>

69
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:44.290
<v Speaker 1>There were a variety of consequences of </v>
<v Speaker 1>making this video,</v>

70
00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.560
<v Speaker 1>which were much more dramatic than I </v>
<v Speaker 1>presume they might be.</v>

71
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:48.783
<v Speaker 1>Although I did know that bill </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] posed to genuine threat to </v>

72
00:04:52.001 --> 00:04:53.470
<v Speaker 1>the integrity of our state.</v>

73
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:54.663
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first consequence was that a very </v>

74
00:04:56.531 --> 00:05:00.790
<v Speaker 1>large number of faculty members at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>University of Toronto decided that I had</v>

75
00:05:00.791 --> 00:05:05.791
<v Speaker 1>made the campus an unsafe place by my </v>
<v Speaker 1>statements and petitioned the university</v>

76
00:05:06.731 --> 00:05:07.564
<v Speaker 1>to do something about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there were a number of </v>

77
00:05:09.371 --> 00:05:10.204
<v Speaker 1>demonstrations and then the University </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Toronto sent me two letters telling </v>

78
00:05:12.911 --> 00:05:17.410
<v Speaker 1>me that I was violating their policies </v>
<v Speaker 1>and probably the law in Ontario,</v>

79
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.930
<v Speaker 1>which was something I had warned about </v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

80
00:05:19.931 --> 00:05:20.764
<v Speaker 1>because the law was written in such a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dismal manner and over inclusive manner </v>

81
00:05:25.031 --> 00:05:30.031
<v Speaker 1>to ensure that even criticizing it could</v>
<v Speaker 1>be prosecuted under its guidelines let's</v>

82
00:05:30.161 --> 00:05:30.994
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there was a debate that the </v>

83
00:05:33.071 --> 00:05:33.904
<v Speaker 1>university held were defenders of bill </v>
<v Speaker 1>see 16 insisted that I was all the </v>

84
00:05:38.231 --> 00:05:39.064
<v Speaker 1>terrible things that I had been called </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that I was misinterpreting the bill </v>

85
00:05:42.341 --> 00:05:43.174
<v Speaker 1>and that the dangers that I forced saw </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a consequence of its implementation </v>

86
00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:48.320
<v Speaker 1>would never manifest themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

87
00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:49.413
<v Speaker 2>rather than to address himself to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientific evidence concerning gender </v>

88
00:05:53.621 --> 00:05:54.454
<v Speaker 2>identity and expression and by adopting </v>
<v Speaker 2>rhetorical strategies more common to </v>

89
00:05:59.151 --> 00:06:03.620
<v Speaker 2>Breitbart news.com then a university </v>
<v Speaker 2>professors lecture,</v>

90
00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:04.813
<v Speaker 2>Dr. Peterson goes on to discredit the </v>
<v Speaker 2>very construct on political grounds </v>

91
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:14.270
<v Speaker 2>instead of on grounds provided by </v>
<v Speaker 2>scholarly evidence that these constructs</v>

92
00:06:14.271 --> 00:06:15.104
<v Speaker 2>are in no particular order leftist </v>
<v Speaker 2>radical and politically correct on the </v>

93
00:06:20.681 --> 00:06:23.930
<v Speaker 2>subject of pronouns and gender </v>
<v Speaker 2>expression.</v>

94
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.870
<v Speaker 2>Dr. Peterson is emphatic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That quote,</v>

95
00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:28.003
<v Speaker 2>I don't recognize another person's right</v>
<v Speaker 2>to determine what pronouns I use to </v>

96
00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:32.474
<v Speaker 2>address them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I won't do it for the vast majority of </v>

97
00:06:35.751 --> 00:06:36.584
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes on to say gender identity and </v>

98
00:06:38.781 --> 00:06:43.070
<v Speaker 2>sexual orientation and I guess he means </v>
<v Speaker 2>sex are the same thing.</v>

99
00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:46.730
<v Speaker 2>And quote as for the definition of </v>
<v Speaker 2>transgender,</v>

100
00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.760
<v Speaker 2>Dr. Peterson claims that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I quote,</v>

101
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people,</v>

102
00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:54.463
<v Speaker 2>these terms stand for good things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that these people use these </v>

103
00:06:58.551 --> 00:06:59.384
<v Speaker 2>terms as a pretense that they stand for </v>
<v Speaker 2>good things as a pretext for them to </v>

104
00:07:04.881 --> 00:07:08.720
<v Speaker 2>continue their nefarious activities and </v>
<v Speaker 2>quote,</v>

105
00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:14.270
<v Speaker 2>well this is hardly the stuff of </v>
<v Speaker 2>academic scholarship</v>

106
00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:17.360
<v Speaker 1>now and I should say to the university's</v>
<v Speaker 1>credit by the way,</v>

107
00:07:17.361 --> 00:07:22.070
<v Speaker 1>that once they got on their feet after </v>
<v Speaker 1>sending me the original two letters,</v>

108
00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:23.173
<v Speaker 1>they seem to have come down quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>strongly on the side of free speech in </v>

109
00:07:25.701 --> 00:07:26.534
<v Speaker 1>the last year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's something positive that's </v>

110
00:07:28.131 --> 00:07:28.964
<v Speaker 1>come out of all this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the truth of the matter was that I </v>

111
00:07:33.051 --> 00:07:33.884
<v Speaker 1>am none of those things and that I had </v>
<v Speaker 1>read the bill and it's surrounding </v>

112
00:07:37.761 --> 00:07:38.594
<v Speaker 1>policies extremely carefully and what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>worse actually understood them and that </v>

113
00:07:42.081 --> 00:07:42.914
<v Speaker 1>what I had done was merely communicate </v>
<v Speaker 1>my understanding and I would say my </v>

114
00:07:46.191 --> 00:07:50.210
<v Speaker 1>proper and accurate understanding of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bill to a public that was actually quite</v>

115
00:07:50.211 --> 00:07:54.500
<v Speaker 1>willing to take the time to investigate </v>
<v Speaker 1>the issue and follow it carefully.</v>

116
00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:58.310
<v Speaker 1>The press initially was very ambivalent </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards me,</v>

117
00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.790
<v Speaker 1>but as some of the leading journalists </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Canada,</v>

118
00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:02.893
<v Speaker 1>including Christie Blatchford and aunt </v>
<v Speaker 1>anella are too so and eventually conrad </v>

119
00:08:06.561 --> 00:08:07.394
<v Speaker 1>black and also Margaret Winter early </v>
<v Speaker 1>listened to the videos that I had made </v>

120
00:08:10.791 --> 00:08:13.550
<v Speaker 1>it and then actually read the policies </v>
<v Speaker 1>in question.</v>

121
00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:18.080
<v Speaker 1>They understood that the bill did it in </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact pose a threat to free speech in the</v>

122
00:08:18.081 --> 00:08:21.980
<v Speaker 1>manner that I had described and came out</v>
<v Speaker 1>very strongly on my side.</v>

123
00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:24.253
<v Speaker 1>Now I have some sympathy for the fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I was tarred with a variety of </v>

124
00:08:27.561 --> 00:08:28.394
<v Speaker 1>epithets immediately after having made </v>
<v Speaker 1>the video because I was warning that </v>

125
00:08:32.121 --> 00:08:32.954
<v Speaker 1>there was something not good going on in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada and whenever anybody warrants </v>

126
00:08:36.831 --> 00:08:37.664
<v Speaker 1>that you should be skeptical of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>because Canada has been a very stable </v>

127
00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:43.640
<v Speaker 1>and well functioning state for a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>long period of time.</v>

128
00:08:43.641 --> 00:08:46.820
<v Speaker 1>So when someone pops out of his rabbit </v>
<v Speaker 1>hole or it comes out of the swamp,</v>

129
00:08:46.821 --> 00:08:50.450
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and says there's something rotten in the</v>

130
00:08:50.451 --> 00:08:52.610
<v Speaker 1>state of Denmark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the proper response is,</v>

131
00:08:52.611 --> 00:08:53.444
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's probably something wrong with </v>

132
00:08:54.231 --> 00:08:55.064
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the next investigative strategy is </v>

133
00:08:57.961 --> 00:08:58.621
<v Speaker 1>to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

134
00:08:58.621 --> 00:08:59.454
<v Speaker 1>here's a bunch of things that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>typically wrong with people that have </v>

135
00:09:01.861 --> 00:09:03.660
<v Speaker 1>something wrong with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bigoted,</v>

136
00:09:03.661 --> 00:09:05.070
<v Speaker 1>transphobic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>racist,</v>

137
00:09:05.071 --> 00:09:05.904
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera.</v>

138
00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:06.893
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're one of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we'll throw those at you and see </v>

139
00:09:09.481 --> 00:09:11.310
<v Speaker 1>if they stick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if they stick,</v>

140
00:09:11.311 --> 00:09:12.144
<v Speaker 1>then we don't have to pay any attention </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the problem and maybe it will go </v>

141
00:09:14.431 --> 00:09:15.264
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the truth of the matter is that I </v>

142
00:09:17.311 --> 00:09:18.144
<v Speaker 1>was and am none of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was fortunate because there was </v>

143
00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:21.894
<v Speaker 1>evidence that that was the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have videotaped virtually everything </v>

144
00:09:25.141 --> 00:09:29.340
<v Speaker 1>I've said to students in the entire 25 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years of my university tenure.</v>

145
00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:34.730
<v Speaker 1>And so everything that I thought was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter of public record and I had posted</v>

146
00:09:35.041 --> 00:09:38.280
<v Speaker 1>it on youtube in the form of hundreds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>lectures.</v>

147
00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:39.263
<v Speaker 1>Not only is there nothing scurrilous and</v>
<v Speaker 1>self damning in those videos is quite </v>

148
00:09:43.171 --> 00:09:44.004
<v Speaker 1>the contrary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have found the content extremely </v>

149
00:09:46.321 --> 00:09:48.720
<v Speaker 1>useful from a psychological perspective </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

150
00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:51.060
<v Speaker 1>and that's now up into the millions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

151
00:09:51.061 --> 00:09:51.894
<v Speaker 1>And so it turns out that I'm not the bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy of the supporters of this bill's </v>

152
00:09:55.771 --> 00:09:56.670
<v Speaker 1>imagination.</v>

153
00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:57.683
<v Speaker 1>Now the other tactic employed by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who have been unhappy about what </v>

154
00:10:02.371 --> 00:10:07.371
<v Speaker 1>I have been saying is to assume that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>an alt right or even a far right figure,</v>

155
00:10:08.341 --> 00:10:09.174
<v Speaker 1>which is an accusation that has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>leveled at me many times in the last </v>

156
00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:15.840
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's also a reason for that.</v>

157
00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.033
<v Speaker 1>The reason for that is that the group of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people to the right of the radical left </v>

158
00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:21.323
<v Speaker 1>is a very large group and it includes </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone from socialists say of the </v>

159
00:10:24.781 --> 00:10:25.614
<v Speaker 1>classic 1970s type all the way to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most far right Nazis imaginable who are </v>

160
00:10:29.791 --> 00:10:30.624
<v Speaker 1>all united in their opposition to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>radical left agenda and thus form what </v>

161
00:10:35.701 --> 00:10:38.250
<v Speaker 1>you might describe as a group by </v>
<v Speaker 1>default.</v>

162
00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:39.503
<v Speaker 1>Now the fact that some of the members of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a group by default are unsavory </v>

163
00:10:44.101 --> 00:10:44.934
<v Speaker 1>characters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does not demonstrate that all of the </v>

164
00:10:47.131 --> 00:10:49.560
<v Speaker 1>members of that group are of that type.</v>

165
00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:54.480
<v Speaker 1>Now it's very convenient for the radical</v>
<v Speaker 1>left and much more straight forward than</v>

166
00:10:54.481 --> 00:10:55.314
<v Speaker 1>actually formulating arguments to assume</v>
<v Speaker 1>that everyone who doesn't think exactly </v>

167
00:10:58.861 --> 00:11:01.710
<v Speaker 1>what they think is some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>monstrous figure,</v>

168
00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:06.810
<v Speaker 1>but it happens to not be the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are many reasonable people,</v>

169
00:11:06.811 --> 00:11:07.644
<v Speaker 1>in fact a vast majority of reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are firmly opposed to the </v>

170
00:11:10.441 --> 00:11:11.274
<v Speaker 1>agenda of the radical left and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely unreasonable to lump them in </v>

171
00:11:14.371 --> 00:11:17.910
<v Speaker 1>with outright far right and not see type</v>
<v Speaker 1>figures.</v>

172
00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:22.740
<v Speaker 1>Part of the reason that the postmodern </v>
<v Speaker 1>neo Marxist find themselves compelled to</v>

173
00:11:22.741 --> 00:11:23.574
<v Speaker 1>do so is because they believe that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>are correct and that they have right on </v>

174
00:11:27.541 --> 00:11:28.374
<v Speaker 1>their side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if it turns out that anyone </v>

175
00:11:30.871 --> 00:11:31.704
<v Speaker 1>reasonable is objecting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the fact of that reasonable </v>

176
00:11:33.901 --> 00:11:37.650
<v Speaker 1>opposition would make it necessary for </v>
<v Speaker 1>some things to be rethought.</v>

177
00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:38.813
<v Speaker 1>And so it's much easier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would also say much more </v>

178
00:11:40.951 --> 00:11:41.784
<v Speaker 1>gratifying to an inner sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>resentment and vengefulness to merely </v>

179
00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:50.100
<v Speaker 1>tar everyone who doesn't agree with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same brush.</v>

180
00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:50.933
<v Speaker 1>And the argument be damned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This brings us to the most fundamental </v>

181
00:11:55.961 --> 00:11:56.794
<v Speaker 1>reason why there has been such </v>
<v Speaker 1>vociferous opposition generated in </v>

182
00:12:01.271 --> 00:12:02.104
<v Speaker 1>relationship to what I've been saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's because I got the </v>

183
00:12:05.681 --> 00:12:06.514
<v Speaker 1>interpretation of bill see 16 and its </v>
<v Speaker 1>surrounding policies and the pernicious </v>

184
00:12:11.021 --> 00:12:15.550
<v Speaker 1>postmodern Neil Marxist doctrine that </v>
<v Speaker 1>gave rise to it essentially correct.</v>

185
00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:19.510
<v Speaker 1>And it's in the best interest of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>who are pushing this pernicious doctrine</v>

186
00:12:19.511 --> 00:12:20.344
<v Speaker 1>and its legislative consequences to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything possible to discredit me so </v>

187
00:12:23.921 --> 00:12:24.754
<v Speaker 1>that the facts of the matter remain </v>
<v Speaker 1>hidden from the general public and </v>

188
00:12:27.731 --> 00:12:32.260
<v Speaker 1>perhaps even from those who have </v>
<v Speaker 1>formulated the doctrine themselves.</v>

189
00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:33.603
<v Speaker 1>So I read bill [inaudible] and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>surrounding policies that would guide </v>

190
00:12:37.211 --> 00:12:41.590
<v Speaker 1>it's interpretation as formulated by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ontario Human Rights Commission.</v>

191
00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:42.933
<v Speaker 1>And then I informed the public to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>best of my ability about the content of </v>

192
00:12:46.631 --> 00:12:49.720
<v Speaker 1>that legislation and policies and its </v>
<v Speaker 1>intent.</v>

193
00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:52.810
<v Speaker 1>And we've outlined the consequences.</v>

194
00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:58.920
<v Speaker 1>Two major questions remain is what I had</v>
<v Speaker 1>to say to be trusted.</v>

195
00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:04.060
<v Speaker 1>And if I was correct in my analysis and </v>
<v Speaker 1>diagnosis,</v>

196
00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:07.300
<v Speaker 1>what steps should be taken now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if any,</v>

197
00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:08.313
<v Speaker 1>to rectify the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's begin with the question of </v>

198
00:13:12.251 --> 00:13:15.490
<v Speaker 1>whether or not my interpretation is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be trusted.</v>

199
00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:20.020
<v Speaker 1>And we'll start that with a brief </v>
<v Speaker 1>overview.</v>

200
00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:24.430
<v Speaker 1>And then an analysis of the recent </v>
<v Speaker 1>events at Wilfrid laurier university.</v>

201
00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:26.223
<v Speaker 1>As you may know or may not know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but should know at Wilfrid laurier </v>

202
00:13:29.831 --> 00:13:31.000
<v Speaker 1>university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Recently,</v>

203
00:13:31.001 --> 00:13:31.834
<v Speaker 1>a teaching assistant named Lindsay </v>
<v Speaker 1>Shepherd found herself in hot water </v>

204
00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:36.183
<v Speaker 1>because she had the temerity to play a </v>
<v Speaker 1>video clip from TV shows the agenda in </v>

205
00:13:41.561 --> 00:13:42.394
<v Speaker 1>the class that she was charged with </v>
<v Speaker 1>conducting as a consequence of playing </v>

206
00:13:46.031 --> 00:13:46.864
<v Speaker 1>the video clip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was brought in front of a </v>

207
00:13:48.791 --> 00:13:51.790
<v Speaker 1>disciplinary panel consisting of three </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals,</v>

208
00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:52.893
<v Speaker 1>Nathan Ramboo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canna Herbert Pimlott and Adriana Joel </v>

209
00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:58.113
<v Speaker 1>ramboo counter and Pimlott our </v>
<v Speaker 1>professors in the communications </v>

210
00:14:01.091 --> 00:14:01.924
<v Speaker 1>department at Wilfrid Laurier University</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Andrea Joel is an administrator who </v>

211
00:14:05.861 --> 00:14:10.300
<v Speaker 1>was hired as a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>legislation introduced by Kathleen Wynne</v>

212
00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:11.553
<v Speaker 1>to conduct exactly the sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>disciplinary investigation that she sat </v>

213
00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:18.970
<v Speaker 1>in on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now Lindsay Shepherd had the presence of</v>

214
00:14:18.971 --> 00:14:23.971
<v Speaker 1>mind and the fear to tape the </v>
<v Speaker 1>disciplinary hearing and after the story</v>

215
00:14:27.251 --> 00:14:28.084
<v Speaker 1>about what had happened was released,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lindsey released the entire audio tape </v>

216
00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:33.963
<v Speaker 1>and caused a national and international </v>
<v Speaker 1>scandal and would be interested to see </v>

217
00:14:37.841 --> 00:14:41.950
<v Speaker 1>the original complaint or complaints </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I don't really have any context.</v>

218
00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:44.540
<v Speaker 1>What exactly that problem ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>

219
00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:46.050
<v Speaker 1>can I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

220
00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:51.890
<v Speaker 1>Can I just ask anything to maybe just </v>
<v Speaker 1>provide us with full frame?</v>

221
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:52.813
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one.</v>

222
00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:53.673
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just like to hear the whole like your </v>

223
00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:58.050

224
00:14:58.060 --> 00:14:59.750
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what took place.</v>

225
00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:02.200
<v Speaker 3>So if you could just give us the whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>story and then,</v>

<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>

227
00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:06.410
<v Speaker 3>I just feel that because I'm just </v>
<v Speaker 3>sitting in the night.</v>

228
00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:08.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

229
00:15:08.331 --> 00:15:09.164
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

230
00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:11.210
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have to teach about grammar.</v>

231
00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:12.433
<v Speaker 3>And in the Pearson book there was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>section about pronouns and using like </v>

232
00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:19.340
<v Speaker 3>gendered language.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I wanted to make it more engaging.</v>

233
00:15:19.341 --> 00:15:22.400
<v Speaker 3>So what I did is we were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

234
00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:25.250
<v Speaker 3>in paper is using,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say as,</v>

235
00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:26.173
<v Speaker 3>as like a singular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then we're also talking about like </v>

236
00:15:28.731 --> 00:15:31.340
<v Speaker 3>his and hers and like how to construct </v>
<v Speaker 3>sentences with that.</v>

237
00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:36.260
<v Speaker 3>And then to contextualize it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I brought up like a youtube debate,</v>

238
00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:39.080
<v Speaker 3>so debate with both sides during </v>
<v Speaker 3>Peterson sides.</v>

239
00:15:39.081 --> 00:15:40.970
<v Speaker 3>And this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this fellow named Nicolas Matt,</v>

240
00:15:40.971 --> 00:15:42.170
<v Speaker 3>who was also a prophet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uft.</v>

241
00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:43.550
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they,</v>

242
00:15:43.551 --> 00:15:45.510
<v Speaker 3>you don't have the name of the video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

243
00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:48.110
<v Speaker 3>it was from the agenda with Steve Pagan,</v>

244
00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:52.090
<v Speaker 4>what's in a name,</v>
<v Speaker 4>potentially a great deal.</v>

245
00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:55.840
<v Speaker 4>University of Toronto,</v>
<v Speaker 4>psychology professor Jordan Peterson has</v>

246
00:15:55.841 --> 00:15:56.674
<v Speaker 4>a fight on his hands after objecting to </v>
<v Speaker 4>proposed legislation that he says would </v>

247
00:16:00.191 --> 00:16:01.024
<v Speaker 4>violate his freedom of speech by forcing</v>
<v Speaker 4>him to address transgendered people </v>

248
00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:05.523
<v Speaker 4>using the pronouns of their choosing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joining us now to better understand the </v>

249
00:16:08.711 --> 00:16:12.070
<v Speaker 4>issue and debate what's at stake in </v>

<v Speaker 4>hottest topics in the country today.</v>

263
00:16:50.681 --> 00:16:55.060
<v Speaker 4>with our conversation here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to give people a sense of how hot</v>

264
00:16:55.061 --> 00:16:59.890
<v Speaker 4>this has got.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A starting on the downtown campus or the</v>

<v Speaker 4>University of Toronto.</v>

266
00:17:07.830 --> 00:17:08.663
<v Speaker 5>Well as you can see that you're honored.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some free speech are capable of making </v>

267
00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:12.303
<v Speaker 5>the lords the brine articulately noise </v>
<v Speaker 5>free speech mechanism by which we keep </v>

268
00:17:17.051 --> 00:17:20.660
<v Speaker 5>our society functioning.</v>
<v Speaker 5>By doing this,</v>

269
00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:32.110
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to post this online that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>would like people to not to be,</v>

270
00:17:32.111 --> 00:17:36.130
<v Speaker 3>to be more accommodating of trans people</v>
<v Speaker 3>and people of color at your events.</v>

271
00:17:36.131 --> 00:17:37.910
<v Speaker 3>In future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would a person of color.</v>

272
00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:40.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm a person of color and I felt very </v>
<v Speaker 3>accommodating here.</v>

273
00:17:40.541 --> 00:17:43.240
<v Speaker 3>There had been multiple,</v>
<v Speaker 3>multiple recorded instances.</v>

274
00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:45.400
<v Speaker 3>I'm trans people killing themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

275
00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:47.210
<v Speaker 3>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they are,</v>

276
00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:49.530
<v Speaker 3>because they are not being integrated </v>
<v Speaker 3>into society.</v>

277
00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:52.590
<v Speaker 3>If it wasn't for this long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I asked you to refer to me.</v>

278
00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:54.383
<v Speaker 3>What'd you do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do you have the authority to </v>

279
00:17:55.141 --> 00:17:59.910
<v Speaker 3>determine whether or not an individual </v>
<v Speaker 3>is worthy of you using their pronouns?</v>

280
00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:01.523
<v Speaker 3>Like if I asked you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would you please use they them pronouns </v>

281
00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:04.190
<v Speaker 3>for me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

282
00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:08.520
<v Speaker 3>What do you want us to jump through?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are my pronouns.</v>

283
00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:10.970
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>With um,</v>

284
00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:12.940
<v Speaker 4>indulgence of everybody else on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>program.</v>

285
00:18:12.941 --> 00:18:13.774
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to start with Professor </v>
<v Speaker 4>Peterson off the top here for a while </v>

286
00:18:15.401 --> 00:18:19.960
<v Speaker 4>because as I suggested you thought long </v>
<v Speaker 4>and hard about this,</v>

287
00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:23.980
<v Speaker 4>you posted a few things up to youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

288
00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:26.260
<v Speaker 4>because you had been thinking long and </v>
<v Speaker 4>hard about it.</v>

289
00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:30.160
<v Speaker 4>One and a half million hits later,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jordan,</v>

290
00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:32.260
<v Speaker 4>one and a half million,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's later.</v>

291
00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:35.680
<v Speaker 4>This has become a huge issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So let's start there.</v>

292
00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:39.160
<v Speaker 4>Why did you post those views to youtube </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the first place?</v>

293
00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:42.950
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's proximate and distal reasons.</v>

294
00:18:42.951 --> 00:18:46.310
<v Speaker 6>The proximate reasons was because I </v>
<v Speaker 6>received some correspondence from,</v>

295
00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:47.533
<v Speaker 6>from,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

296
00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:51.220
<v Speaker 6>from clients of mine who had been,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

297
00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:52.783
<v Speaker 6>I would say persecuted in a variety of </v>
<v Speaker 6>ways by people who were politically </v>

298
00:18:56.151 --> 00:18:56.984
<v Speaker 6>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And they sent me some documentation </v>

299
00:19:00.051 --> 00:19:00.884
<v Speaker 6>about bill [inaudible] 16 and the </v>
<v Speaker 6>associated policy statements on the </v>

300
00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:05.473
<v Speaker 6>Ontario Human Rights Commission,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which I read and was not very happy </v>

301
00:19:08.031 --> 00:19:08.960
<v Speaker 6>about.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

302
00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:10.273
<v Speaker 6>and also because the University of </v>
<v Speaker 6>Toronto decided to make anti racism and </v>

303
00:19:13.671 --> 00:19:14.504
<v Speaker 6>anti bias training,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so called anti racism and anti bias </v>

304
00:19:16.611 --> 00:19:17.444
<v Speaker 6>training mandatory,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which are regarded as an inappropriate </v>

305
00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:21.313
<v Speaker 6>incursion into the domain of political </v>
<v Speaker 6>opinion by the university </v>

306
00:19:24.231 --> 00:19:26.210
<v Speaker 6>administration.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Have you taken that training yet?</v>

307
00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:27.680
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I don't have to.</v>

308
00:19:27.681 --> 00:19:28.300
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

309
00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:29.133
<v Speaker 6>it's the HR department personnel that </v>
<v Speaker 6>have to take it if they decide that you </v>

310
00:19:32.001 --> 00:19:32.834
<v Speaker 6>have to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>will you?</v>

311
00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:34.880
<v Speaker 6>No Way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not a chance.</v>

312
00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:37.010
<v Speaker 6>And what's the other,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you referred to persecution that friends</v>

313
00:19:37.011 --> 00:19:39.420
<v Speaker 6>are clients of yours had experienced,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so yeah.</v>

314
00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:40.303
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

315
00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:41.173
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there are lots of places now where the </v>

316
00:19:43.641 --> 00:19:46.640
<v Speaker 6>workplace has become,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would say excessively politicized.</v>

317
00:19:46.641 --> 00:19:49.700
<v Speaker 6>And so people who have viewpoints,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and this also involves,</v>

318
00:19:49.701 --> 00:19:50.534
<v Speaker 6>includes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would say fairly radical leftist view </v>

319
00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:55.880
<v Speaker 6>points.</v>
<v Speaker 6>People don't feel comfortable at all in,</v>

320
00:19:55.910 --> 00:19:56.743
<v Speaker 6>in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in being able to use the language of </v>

321
00:19:57.951 --> 00:19:58.784
<v Speaker 6>their choice or to have even no opinions</v>
<v Speaker 6>about a variety of different things </v>

322
00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:02.593
<v Speaker 6>essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guess what I'm asking you is to lay </v>

323
00:20:03.591 --> 00:20:05.930
<v Speaker 6>the case out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What is it you find offensive about this</v>

324
00:20:05.931 --> 00:20:07.160
<v Speaker 6>legislation?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

325
00:20:07.161 --> 00:20:07.994
<v Speaker 6>fundamentally the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there were two things that really </v>

326
00:20:09.411 --> 00:20:10.244
<v Speaker 6>bothered me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>although there have been other things </v>

327
00:20:11.181 --> 00:20:12.014
<v Speaker 6>I've thought about since.</v>
<v Speaker 6>One was that I was being asked as </v>

328
00:20:14.931 --> 00:20:18.530
<v Speaker 6>everyone is to use a certain set of </v>
<v Speaker 6>words that I think are the constructions</v>

329
00:20:18.531 --> 00:20:21.120
<v Speaker 6>of people who have a political ideology </v>
<v Speaker 6>that I don't believe in,</v>

330
00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:23.150
<v Speaker 6>that I also regard is as dangerous.</v>

331
00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:24.013
<v Speaker 6>What are those words?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Those are the made up words to read </v>

332
00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:28.490
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that people now describe as um,</v>

333
00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:32.030
<v Speaker 6>as gender neutral.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so to me,</v>

334
00:20:32.031 --> 00:20:32.864
<v Speaker 6>they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're there an attempt to control </v>

335
00:20:35.481 --> 00:20:36.314
<v Speaker 6>language and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and in a direction that isn't happening </v>

336
00:20:39.051 --> 00:20:40.820
<v Speaker 6>organically.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not happening naturally.</v>

337
00:20:40.821 --> 00:20:41.654
<v Speaker 6>People aren't picking up these words in </v>
<v Speaker 6>the typical way that new words are </v>

338
00:20:44.001 --> 00:20:46.770
<v Speaker 6>picked up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but by force and by FIA 10,</v>

339
00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:49.600
<v Speaker 6>I would say by force,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because there's legislative power behind</v>

340
00:20:49.601 --> 00:20:51.640
<v Speaker 6>them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like these made up words,</v>

341
00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:53.740
<v Speaker 6>xe and Zer and that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What about,</v>

342
00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:57.430
<v Speaker 6>they're not all made up where it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>quote unquote made up words for example,</v>

343
00:20:57.490 --> 00:20:58.690
<v Speaker 6>they is one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

344
00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:00.760
<v Speaker 6>But we speak to an individual as they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

345
00:21:00.761 --> 00:21:03.970
<v Speaker 6>But we can't dispense with the </v>
<v Speaker 6>distinction between singular and plural.</v>

346
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:04.833
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know that the advocates of that </v>

347
00:21:05.681 --> 00:21:06.514
<v Speaker 6>particular approach say that they has </v>
<v Speaker 6>been used forever as a singular and </v>

348
00:21:09.071 --> 00:21:10.300
<v Speaker 6>that's actually not correct.</v>

349
00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:13.480
<v Speaker 6>It's used as a singular in very </v>
<v Speaker 6>exceptional circumstances.</v>

350
00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:15.550
<v Speaker 6>So we understand your views and where </v>
<v Speaker 6>you're coming from.</v>

351
00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:16.683
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you decided to lay these views out in </v>

352
00:21:18.731 --> 00:21:21.820
<v Speaker 6>some youtube discourses.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

353
00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:24.340
<v Speaker 6>You put them up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the response has been overwhelming.</v>

354
00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:26.710
<v Speaker 6>Did you anticipate that you would get </v>
<v Speaker 6>this kind of feedback?</v>

355
00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:27.843
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there was no way of anticipating this </v>

356
00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:30.790
<v Speaker 6>and I think you mentioned in the Intro,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

357
00:21:30.791 --> 00:21:34.570
<v Speaker 6>that this is a consequence of what I've </v>
<v Speaker 6>done and I don't think that's true.</v>

358
00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:37.300
<v Speaker 6>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a consequence of the fact I thought</v>

359
00:21:37.301 --> 00:21:39.250
<v Speaker 6>about it then.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think the right metaphor is that,</v>

360
00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:40.773
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a large forest and it's been a </v>

361
00:21:42.461 --> 00:21:43.294
<v Speaker 6>hot,</v>
<v Speaker 6>dry summer or maybe a drought and </v>

362
00:21:45.101 --> 00:21:45.934
<v Speaker 6>there's plenty of deadwood gathered and </v>
<v Speaker 6>I lit a spark and you can't blame the </v>

363
00:21:49.181 --> 00:21:50.014
<v Speaker 6>forest fire on the spark.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There is out there an appetite against </v>

364
00:21:52.961 --> 00:21:55.090
<v Speaker 6>political correctness,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is what you have described.</v>

365
00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:55.923
<v Speaker 6>This says in fact your youtube videos </v>
<v Speaker 6>called professor against political </v>

366
00:21:58.301 --> 00:21:59.134
<v Speaker 6>correctness.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But let's make sure we're all speaking </v>

367
00:22:00.491 --> 00:22:02.470
<v Speaker 6>the same language here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You would define that,</v>

368
00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:05.290
<v Speaker 6>how political correctness,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

369
00:22:05.291 --> 00:22:08.860
<v Speaker 6>I think it's a particular kind of </v>
<v Speaker 6>ideological game and I think the outcome</v>

370
00:22:08.861 --> 00:22:09.694
<v Speaker 6>is two fold.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's to make the player feel morally </v>

371
00:22:11.171 --> 00:22:12.004
<v Speaker 6>superior and also to take rather serious</v>
<v Speaker 6>acts swings at the foundation of </v>

372
00:22:17.381 --> 00:22:18.214
<v Speaker 6>society.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so the game is identify a domain of </v>

373
00:22:20.981 --> 00:22:21.814
<v Speaker 6>human endeavor.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Note that there's a distribution of </v>

374
00:22:24.281 --> 00:22:25.114
<v Speaker 6>success.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Some people are doing comparatively </v>

375
00:22:26.591 --> 00:22:28.630
<v Speaker 6>better and some people are doing </v>
<v Speaker 6>comparatively worse.</v>

376
00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:30.123
<v Speaker 6>Define those doing worse as victims.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Define those doing better as </v>

377
00:22:33.431 --> 00:22:36.430
<v Speaker 6>perpetrators.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Identify with the victims,</v>

378
00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:40.630
<v Speaker 6>have yourself a set of enemies handy to </v>
<v Speaker 6>vent your resentment on.</v>

379
00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:44.410
<v Speaker 6>Feel good about it even though it didn't</v>
<v Speaker 6>really require any work on your part.</v>

380
00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:45.513
<v Speaker 6>And then endlessly repeat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And let's do one more question here and </v>

381
00:22:48.131 --> 00:22:49.870
<v Speaker 6>then we'll get everybody else into the </v>
<v Speaker 6>conversation.</v>

382
00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:52.480
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>of course that since this story broke,</v>

383
00:22:52.481 --> 00:22:54.400
<v Speaker 6>you've been called a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

384
00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:57.180
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one of which is a trans phobe.</v>

385
00:22:57.310 --> 00:23:00.010
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Some people have accused you of um,</v>

386
00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:03.730
<v Speaker 6>using the free speech issue to mask </v>
<v Speaker 6>what's really going on here,</v>

387
00:23:03.731 --> 00:23:04.564
<v Speaker 6>which is an attempt to deprive other </v>
<v Speaker 6>people of what they believe are their </v>

388
00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:08.973
<v Speaker 6>legitimate rights.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well I know when to give you the </v>

389
00:23:10.031 --> 00:23:10.864
<v Speaker 6>opportunity to speak to whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 6>you are a trans phobe well I can tell </v>

390
00:23:13.421 --> 00:23:14.254
<v Speaker 6>you that I've received more letters from</v>
<v Speaker 6>transsexual people supporting me then </v>

391
00:23:17.051 --> 00:23:17.884
<v Speaker 6>opposing me and I never said anything </v>
<v Speaker 6>really about transsexual people about </v>

392
00:23:21.491 --> 00:23:23.470
<v Speaker 6>their existence.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Although that was the first thing that I</v>

393
00:23:23.471 --> 00:23:24.304
<v Speaker 6>was accused of doing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I didn't say that transsexual people </v>

394
00:23:26.981 --> 00:23:29.380
<v Speaker 6>didn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I said that gender identity,</v>

395
00:23:29.381 --> 00:23:33.010
<v Speaker 6>gender expression and biological sex do </v>
<v Speaker 6>not vary independently,</v>

396
00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:34.023
<v Speaker 6>which they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so this issue is in some sense only </v>

397
00:23:37.331 --> 00:23:40.870
<v Speaker 6>peripherally about about transsexual </v>
<v Speaker 6>issues.</v>

398
00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:46.080
<v Speaker 6>It's more centrally about gender issues.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then on top of it's the biggest</v>

399
00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:48.510
<v Speaker 4>issue is is that it's a free speech </v>
<v Speaker 4>issue.</v>

400
00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:49.613
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let us continue to explore all of those </v>

401
00:23:51.931 --> 00:23:54.770
<v Speaker 4>issues that you have just raised.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

402
00:23:54.930 --> 00:23:56.430
<v Speaker 4>what do we do this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's take a moment.</v>

403
00:23:56.431 --> 00:23:58.170
<v Speaker 4>We're going to explain a few basic </v>
<v Speaker 4>things here.</v>

404
00:23:58.530 --> 00:23:59.363
<v Speaker 4>The issue of so called non traditional </v>
<v Speaker 4>pronouns goes together with non </v>

405
00:24:01.461 --> 00:24:04.500
<v Speaker 4>traditional gender identities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>New York City for example,</v>

406
00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:09.810
<v Speaker 4>recognizes 31 such gender expressions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In other words besides man and woman,</v>

407
00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:13.650
<v Speaker 4>there are 29 other gender expressions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For example,</v>

408
00:24:13.651 --> 00:24:15.120
<v Speaker 4>Penn Gender Queer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gender,</v>

409
00:24:15.121 --> 00:24:15.954
<v Speaker 4>gender fluid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>crossdresser by gendered gender blender </v>

410
00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:20.850
<v Speaker 4>and the list goes on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Nicholas,</v>

411
00:24:20.851 --> 00:24:24.150
<v Speaker 4>this is where I want to bring you in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>discussion because you teach this,</v>

412
00:24:24.151 --> 00:24:24.984
<v Speaker 4>you teach trans studies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you would give us a brief primer </v>

413
00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:28.973
<v Speaker 4>on so many gender identities that in </v>
<v Speaker 4>your view require non traditional </v>

414
00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:35.880
<v Speaker 4>pronouns.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Basically</v>

415
00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:41.440
<v Speaker 3>not correct that there is such a thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>as biological sex and I'm a historian of</v>

416
00:24:41.441 --> 00:24:42.274
<v Speaker 3>medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can unpack that for you at great </v>

417
00:24:43.931 --> 00:24:46.900
<v Speaker 3>length if you want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in the interest of time I won't.</v>

418
00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:50.920
<v Speaker 3>So that's a very popular misconceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like a youtube debate.</v>

419
00:24:50.921 --> 00:24:54.010
<v Speaker 3>It was one hour long but I showed about </v>
<v Speaker 3>five minutes and then some,</v>

420
00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:56.470
<v Speaker 3>I mean the students were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were very interested.</v>

421
00:24:56.471 --> 00:24:58.450
<v Speaker 3>I could tell they're all of their eyes </v>
<v Speaker 3>were on the screen.</v>

422
00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:01.870
<v Speaker 3>And after when we had a debate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were people of all opinions.</v>

423
00:25:01.871 --> 00:25:04.330
<v Speaker 3>And like from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from what I could see,</v>

424
00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:06.220
<v Speaker 3>it was a very friendly debate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

425
00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:09.550
<v Speaker 3>obviously this person who had an issue </v>
<v Speaker 3>did not express it to me.</v>

426
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.910
<v Speaker 3>They just went straight to whoever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

427
00:25:12.911 --> 00:25:13.900
<v Speaker 3>I don't really know what happened.</v>

428
00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:16.420
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

429
00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:19.500
<v Speaker 7>just for some additional context.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So you come,</v>

430
00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:21.540
<v Speaker 7>you came from uft,</v>
<v Speaker 7>is that right?</v>

431
00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:22.310
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no.</v>

432
00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:23.143
<v Speaker 7>You,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

433
00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:24.450
<v Speaker 7>you mess up.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You,</v>

434
00:25:24.451 --> 00:25:25.290
<v Speaker 7>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So you weren't,</v>

435
00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:27.220
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like one of Jordan Peterson,</v>

436
00:25:27.221 --> 00:25:29.250
<v Speaker 7>the students know.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

437
00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:33.000
<v Speaker 7>so just to give you some context though,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Jordan Peterson is,</v>

438
00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:36.120
<v Speaker 7>he is a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a figure that's uh,</v>

439
00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:39.750
<v Speaker 7>basically highly involved with the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>with the alt right.</v>

440
00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:42.160
<v Speaker 7>He lectures about,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

441
00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:47.070
<v Speaker 7>basically like critiquing of feminism,</v>
<v Speaker 7>critiquing,</v>

442
00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:48.570
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>trans rights.</v>

443
00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:50.071
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm familiar.</v>

444
00:25:50.071 --> 00:25:51.080
<v Speaker 7>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't see,</v>

445
00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:52.200
<v Speaker 7>I follow up on,</v>
<v Speaker 7>on critique.</v>

446
00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:53.350
<v Speaker 7>You okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So yeah,</v>

447
00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:56.190
<v Speaker 3>nothing is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can you share people from those ideas?</v>

448
00:25:56.970 --> 00:25:57.803
<v Speaker 3>Am I supposed to comfort them and make </v>
<v Speaker 3>sure that they are insulated away from </v>

449
00:26:01.411 --> 00:26:03.590
<v Speaker 3>this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like is that what the point of visits?</v>

450
00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:07.500
<v Speaker 3>Because to me that is so against what a </v>
<v Speaker 3>university is about.</v>

451
00:26:07.650 --> 00:26:12.450
<v Speaker 3>So against it I was not taking sides.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was presenting both arguments.</v>

452
00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:12.950
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

453
00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:17.950
<v Speaker 7>So the thing of it is about this is if </v>
<v Speaker 7>you're presenting something like this,</v>

454
00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:19.310
<v Speaker 7>it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

455
00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:23.570
<v Speaker 7>you have to think about the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 7>teaching climate that you're creating.</v>

456
00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:24.853
<v Speaker 7>And this is actually,</v>
<v Speaker 7>these arguments are counter to the </v>

457
00:26:28.881 --> 00:26:32.030
<v Speaker 7>Canadian human rights code.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

458
00:26:32.031 --> 00:26:34.370
<v Speaker 7>ever since I know that you talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

459
00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:35.563
<v Speaker 7>see 16 ever since this past,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it is discriminatory to be targeting </v>

460
00:26:41.241 --> 00:26:42.650
<v Speaker 7>someone,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

461
00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:45.330
<v Speaker 7>due their gender identity or gender </v>
<v Speaker 7>expression.</v>

462
00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:48.390
<v Speaker 7>So bringing something like that up in </v>
<v Speaker 7>class,</v>

463
00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:49.253
<v Speaker 7>not critically.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I understand that you're trying to </v>

464
00:26:50.821 --> 00:26:51.780
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was critical.</v>

465
00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:55.430
<v Speaker 7>I introduced it critically.</v>
<v Speaker 7>How so?</v>

466
00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:56.750
<v Speaker 7>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like I said,</v>

467
00:26:56.751 --> 00:26:58.140
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was in the spirit of debate.</v>

468
00:26:58.350 --> 00:26:59.183
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>In the spirit of the debate is slightly </v>

469
00:27:01.441 --> 00:27:03.390
<v Speaker 7>different than being like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>

470
00:27:03.391 --> 00:27:04.224
<v Speaker 7>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is like a problematic idea that we </v>

471
00:27:06.241 --> 00:27:08.970
<v Speaker 7>want to meet when we want to unpack.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But that's taking sides.</v>

472
00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:10.353
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like it's taking sides for me to be </v>

473
00:27:11.191 --> 00:27:12.630
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh look at this guy.</v>

474
00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:14.580
<v Speaker 7>Like everything that comes out,</v>
<v Speaker 7>his mouth is bs,</v>

475
00:27:14.581 --> 00:27:15.840
<v Speaker 7>but we're going to watch anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

476
00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:20.760
<v Speaker 7>So I understand the position that you </v>
<v Speaker 7>coming from and your positionality,</v>

477
00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:26.180
<v Speaker 7>but the reality is that it has created a</v>
<v Speaker 7>toxic climate for some of the students.</v>

478
00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:29.323
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it,</v>

479
00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:32.490
<v Speaker 7>it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like how many one,</v>

480
00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:33.690
<v Speaker 7>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>May I speak?</v>

481
00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:36.780
<v Speaker 7>I have no,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I had no concept of,</v>

482
00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:40.200
<v Speaker 7>of like how many people complained,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like what their complaint was.</v>

483
00:27:40.201 --> 00:27:42.660
<v Speaker 7>You haven't showed me the complaint.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yes,</v>

484
00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:45.900
<v Speaker 7>I understand that this is upsetting,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but there's also a confidential,</v>

485
00:27:45.901 --> 00:27:48.420
<v Speaker 7>at the end,</v>
<v Speaker 7>confidentiality matters.</v>

486
00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:50.560
<v Speaker 7>The number of people is confidential.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>

487
00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:52.273
<v Speaker 7>It is one or multiple students who have </v>
<v Speaker 7>come forward saying that this is </v>

488
00:27:56.311 --> 00:27:59.100
<v Speaker 7>something that they were concerned about</v>
<v Speaker 7>it and that it made them uncomfortable.</v>

489
00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:02.880
<v Speaker 7>If this is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>for example,</v>

490
00:28:02.881 --> 00:28:03.714
<v Speaker 7>a trans student,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is basically debating whether or </v>

491
00:28:06.511 --> 00:28:10.920
<v Speaker 7>not a trans student should have rights </v>
<v Speaker 7>within one of their classes.</v>

492
00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:12.223
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and that's not something that is really </v>

493
00:28:13.591 --> 00:28:14.424
<v Speaker 7>acceptable in the context of the kind of</v>
<v Speaker 7>learning environment that we're trying </v>

494
00:28:17.611 --> 00:28:18.444
<v Speaker 7>to create.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It would be the equivalent of debating </v>

495
00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:23.670
<v Speaker 7>whether or not,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

496
00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:24.643
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a student of color should have rights </v>

497
00:28:26.241 --> 00:28:28.350
<v Speaker 7>or,</v>
<v Speaker 7>or should be allowed to be married.</v>

498
00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:31.050
<v Speaker 7>Do you see where you'd like how this is </v>
<v Speaker 7>not,</v>

499
00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:32.303
<v Speaker 7>this is not something that's </v>
<v Speaker 7>intellectually neutral that is kind of </v>

500
00:28:36.061 --> 00:28:37.190
<v Speaker 7>up for debate.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This,</v>

501
00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:38.083
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is the charter of rights and </v>

502
00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:42.390
<v Speaker 7>debate,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I mean,</v>

503
00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:45.570
<v Speaker 7>you're perfectly welcome to your own </v>
<v Speaker 7>opinions,</v>

504
00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:50.370
<v Speaker 7>but when you're bringing it into the </v>
<v Speaker 7>context of the classroom,</v>

505
00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:51.563
<v Speaker 7>that can become problematic.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm not going to become something that </v>

506
00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:56.243
<v Speaker 7>is the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>creates an unsafe learning environment </v>

507
00:28:58.651 --> 00:29:01.230
<v Speaker 7>for students,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but when they leave the university,</v>

508
00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:03.300
<v Speaker 7>they're going to be exposed to these </v>
<v Speaker 7>ideas.</v>

509
00:29:03.301 --> 00:29:08.301
<v Speaker 7>So I don't see how I'm doing a </v>
<v Speaker 7>disservice to the class by exposing them</v>

510
00:29:08.431 --> 00:29:10.320
<v Speaker 7>to ideas that are really out there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I'm sorry,</v>

511
00:29:10.321 --> 00:29:11.154
<v Speaker 7>I'm crying.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm stressed out because this to me is </v>

512
00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:16.890
<v Speaker 7>so wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Can I mention the gender violence,</v>

513
00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:19.320
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>generating actual violence?</v>

514
00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:23.460
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so I agree that,</v>

515
00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:25.740
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it does gender balance,</v>

516
00:29:25.741 --> 00:29:28.260
<v Speaker 7>I think just include sexual violence,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it also includes,</v>

517
00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:31.530
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>targeting folks based on gender.</v>

518
00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:33.270
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so that includes transphobia,</v>

519
00:29:33.271 --> 00:29:34.680
<v Speaker 7>Bi phobia,</v>
<v Speaker 7>homophobia.</v>

520
00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:37.740
<v Speaker 7>All those sorts of things I protected </v>
<v Speaker 7>under the policy.</v>

521
00:29:37.741 --> 00:29:40.730
<v Speaker 7>And so those are things that Laurie has,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

522
00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:41.883
<v Speaker 7>upheld as values,</v>
<v Speaker 7>as well as the Ontario Human Rights </v>

523
00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:46.263
<v Speaker 7>Code.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

524
00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:49.720
<v Speaker 7>and so those are things that we're </v>
<v Speaker 7>responsible for,</v>

525
00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:53.140
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>not,</v>

526
00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:54.123
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>impacting our students in that way and </v>

527
00:29:57.191 --> 00:29:58.024
<v Speaker 7>not,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

528
00:29:58.270 --> 00:30:00.580
<v Speaker 7>not spreading transphobia.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

529
00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:04.690
<v Speaker 7>So what I have a problem with is I </v>
<v Speaker 7>didn't target anybody who did.</v>

530
00:30:04.691 --> 00:30:05.524
<v Speaker 7>I Target Trans folks how by telling my </v>
<v Speaker 7>ideas that are really out there by </v>

531
00:30:09.941 --> 00:30:11.950
<v Speaker 7>telling them that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But</v>

532
00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:14.433
<v Speaker 7>really it's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's not just telling them in </v>

533
00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:26.010
<v Speaker 7>legitimizing this as a valid perspective</v>
<v Speaker 7>as this is another valid perspective and</v>

534
00:30:26.551 --> 00:30:29.230
<v Speaker 7>university,</v>
<v Speaker 7>all perspectives are valid.</v>

535
00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:31.800
<v Speaker 7>That's not necessarily true.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

536
00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:32.673
<v Speaker 7>this,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is something that's being debated </v>

537
00:30:33.971 --> 00:30:34.804
<v Speaker 7>in current society and I don't feel the </v>
<v Speaker 7>need to shield people from what's going </v>

538
00:30:38.111 --> 00:30:38.944
<v Speaker 7>on in society.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like to imagine that this is happening </v>

539
00:30:41.291 --> 00:30:43.810
<v Speaker 7>in university.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's just a bad.</v>

540
00:30:43.870 --> 00:30:44.703
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So just to give you a context also </v>

541
00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:50.620
<v Speaker 7>within all of this is happening.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

542
00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:54.190
<v Speaker 7>Laurie a's being blanketed with white </v>
<v Speaker 7>supremacist,</v>

543
00:30:54.610 --> 00:30:56.320
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>posters currently.</v>

544
00:30:56.850 --> 00:30:59.320
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's another debate in society,</v>

545
00:30:59.770 --> 00:31:00.603
<v Speaker 7>which is whether or not North America </v>
<v Speaker 7>should be a set of white nationalist </v>

546
00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:09.610
<v Speaker 7>states and that it should be ethnically </v>
<v Speaker 7>cleanse of other people.</v>

547
00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:10.593
<v Speaker 7>That is also a current debate society.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Would you show something in your </v>

548
00:31:15.701 --> 00:31:17.340
<v Speaker 7>tutorial that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

549
00:31:17.341 --> 00:31:18.340
<v Speaker 7>had,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

550
00:31:18.550 --> 00:31:19.383
<v Speaker 7>white supremacists and non white </v>
<v Speaker 7>supremacists debating whether or not </v>

551
00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:24.730
<v Speaker 7>other people should live in North </v>
<v Speaker 7>America.</v>

552
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.840
<v Speaker 7>Is that something that you would show,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

553
00:31:27.910 --> 00:31:31.120
<v Speaker 7>if that was related to the content of </v>
<v Speaker 7>the week and we were talking about right</v>

554
00:31:31.121 --> 00:31:32.320
<v Speaker 7>wing speech bubbles?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Maybe</v>

555
00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:35.500
<v Speaker 7>it depends on the content.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like,</v>

556
00:31:35.650 --> 00:31:36.483
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if there's really ideas that are </v>

557
00:31:37.091 --> 00:31:40.000
<v Speaker 7>existing out there like that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>then I mean,</v>

558
00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:42.430
<v Speaker 7>look,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the thing is like,</v>

559
00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:46.420
<v Speaker 7>I don't see what's transphobic about </v>
<v Speaker 7>showing a video of Jordan Peterson.</v>

560
00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:49.210
<v Speaker 7>He's a real person.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He is that he's out there,</v>

561
00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:50.533
<v Speaker 7>he's a real person,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but he's a real person who has engaged </v>

562
00:31:54.021 --> 00:31:58.350
<v Speaker 7>in targeted behavior that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

563
00:31:58.620 --> 00:31:59.080
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>or,</v>

564
00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:00.590
<v Speaker 7>or,</v>
<v Speaker 7>or targeting of,</v>

565
00:32:00.591 --> 00:32:02.420
<v Speaker 7>of Trans Students,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

566
00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:03.710
<v Speaker 7>in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

567
00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:05.930
<v Speaker 7>like basically doxing them,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

568
00:32:05.931 --> 00:32:06.764
<v Speaker 7>if you know the term,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like giving out their personal </v>

569
00:32:08.151 --> 00:32:09.740
<v Speaker 7>information so that they will be </v>
<v Speaker 7>attacked,</v>

570
00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:11.060
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>harassed.</v>

571
00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:14.930
<v Speaker 7>So that death threats will find them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

572
00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:17.420
<v Speaker 7>this is something that he has done to </v>
<v Speaker 7>his own students,</v>

573
00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:19.970
<v Speaker 7>he has done to other students.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

574
00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.460
<v Speaker 7>and this is also something that the </v>
<v Speaker 7>students are aware of.</v>

575
00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:26.150
<v Speaker 7>So this is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is basically like playing,</v>

576
00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:28.153
<v Speaker 7>not to kind of do the thing where </v>
<v Speaker 7>everything is kind of compared to </v>

577
00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:34.920
<v Speaker 7>Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but this is like neutrally playing uh,</v>

578
00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:35.763
<v Speaker 7>a speech by,</v>
<v Speaker 7>by Hitler or Milo Yiannopoulos from </v>

579
00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:39.163
<v Speaker 7>Gamer gate.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is the kind of thing that </v>

580
00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:42.943
<v Speaker 7>departmentally in terms of like critical</v>
<v Speaker 7>communication studies and in terms of </v>

581
00:32:46.821 --> 00:32:51.821
<v Speaker 7>the course of what we're trying to do is</v>
<v Speaker 7>diametrically opposed to everything that</v>

582
00:32:52.851 --> 00:32:54.620
<v Speaker 7>we've been talking about in the lectures</v>

583
00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:56.013
<v Speaker 1>faculty and administration at Wilfrid </v>
<v Speaker 1>laurier university reacted in a number </v>

584
00:32:59.681 --> 00:33:03.310
<v Speaker 1>of different matters to the release of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this tape information.</v>

585
00:33:03.610 --> 00:33:04.443
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to first read you some </v>
<v Speaker 1>excerpts from the independent fact </v>

586
00:33:07.151 --> 00:33:07.984
<v Speaker 1>finding report commissioned by Wilfrid </v>
<v Speaker 1>Laurier University President Deborah </v>

587
00:33:11.411 --> 00:33:12.940
<v Speaker 1>mcclachi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>

588
00:33:13.630 --> 00:33:14.463
<v Speaker 1>I believe it is time for some clarity </v>
<v Speaker 1>around the events of the past few weeks </v>

589
00:33:17.471 --> 00:33:18.304
<v Speaker 1>here at Wilfrid laurier university </v>
<v Speaker 1>stemming from the very regrettable </v>

590
00:33:21.671 --> 00:33:22.504
<v Speaker 1>meeting that followed the showing of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>TV show clip by a teaching assistant </v>

591
00:33:25.690 --> 00:33:26.523
<v Speaker 1>during a tutorial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were numerous errors in judgment </v>

592
00:33:30.431 --> 00:33:31.264
<v Speaker 1>made in the handling of the meeting with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ms. Lindsay Shepherd the ta of the </v>

593
00:33:34.541 --> 00:33:37.030
<v Speaker 1>tutorial and question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

594
00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:39.760
<v Speaker 1>the meeting never should have happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>

595
00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:45.240
<v Speaker 1>No formal complaint nor informal concern</v>
<v Speaker 1>relative to a lorry.</v>

596
00:33:45.241 --> 00:33:49.090
<v Speaker 1>A policy was registered about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>screening of the video.</v>

597
00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:52.060
<v Speaker 1>This was confirmed in the fact finding </v>
<v Speaker 1>report.</v>

598
00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:57.070
<v Speaker 1>There was no wrongdoing on the part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ms. Shepherd in showing the clip from TV</v>

599
00:33:57.220 --> 00:33:58.053
<v Speaker 1>in her tutorial showing a TV oh clip for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the purposes of an academic discussion </v>

600
00:34:03.310 --> 00:34:05.560
<v Speaker 1>is a reasonable classroom teaching tool.</v>

601
00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:06.543
<v Speaker 1>Any instructional material needs to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>grounded in the appropriate academic </v>

602
00:34:09.761 --> 00:34:10.594
<v Speaker 1>underpinnings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To put it in context for the relevance </v>

603
00:34:12.761 --> 00:34:13.594
<v Speaker 1>of the learning outcomes of the course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ensuing discussion also needs to be </v>

604
00:34:17.111 --> 00:34:17.944
<v Speaker 1>handled properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have no reason to believe this </v>

605
00:34:20.021 --> 00:34:23.620
<v Speaker 1>discussion was not handled well in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tutorial in question.</v>

606
00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:29.760
<v Speaker 1>So after Debra mcclachi commissioned an </v>
<v Speaker 1>independent fact finder,</v>

607
00:34:31.330 --> 00:34:33.700
<v Speaker 1>Lindsay Shepherd was completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>exonerated.</v>

608
00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:34.713
<v Speaker 1>I'll put a link to where you can read </v>
<v Speaker 1>the university presidents entire </v>

609
00:34:37.810 --> 00:34:40.450
<v Speaker 1>response to the disciplinary meeting in </v>
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>

610
00:34:40.570 --> 00:34:41.403
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is how Debra mcclachi sums the </v>

611
00:34:45.191 --> 00:34:46.024
<v Speaker 1>situation up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For those who have chosen to use this </v>

612
00:34:48.401 --> 00:34:49.234
<v Speaker 1>incident as an indictment of Wilfrid </v>
<v Speaker 1>laurier university or the plight of </v>

613
00:34:52.751 --> 00:34:57.751
<v Speaker 1>Canadian universities in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say your assertion is unreasonable and</v>

614
00:34:57.941 --> 00:35:00.610
<v Speaker 1>unfounded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While that really is the question,</v>

615
00:35:00.611 --> 00:35:03.220
<v Speaker 1>isn't it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was this a unique occurrence,</v>

616
00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:06.340
<v Speaker 1>a consequence of the misbehavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shall we say,</v>

617
00:35:06.341 --> 00:35:09.430
<v Speaker 1>of two ill informed professors and an </v>
<v Speaker 1>administrator,</v>

618
00:35:09.490 --> 00:35:14.410
<v Speaker 1>or was this actually diagnostic of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>genuine state of Canadian universities,</v>

619
00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:16.480
<v Speaker 1>perhaps universities in the Western </v>
<v Speaker 1>world?</v>

620
00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:20.920
<v Speaker 1>We have to review the evidence at hand </v>
<v Speaker 1>first.</v>

621
00:35:20.921 --> 00:35:23.350
<v Speaker 1>We have what happened at Wilfrid laurier</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

622
00:35:23.830 --> 00:35:24.663
<v Speaker 1>I would like to point out that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>events there were more serious and less </v>

623
00:35:28.181 --> 00:35:31.150
<v Speaker 1>predictable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even then what I had warned about when I</v>

624
00:35:31.151 --> 00:35:34.930
<v Speaker 1>made my original video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I assumed that people would be,</v>

625
00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:38.460
<v Speaker 1>could be prosecuted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>failure to use</v>

626
00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:43.140
<v Speaker 8>preferred pronouns,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and I was objecting to that as a example</v>

627
00:35:43.141 --> 00:35:43.974
<v Speaker 8>of compelled speech,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but I never imagined that a teaching </v>

628
00:35:46.831 --> 00:35:50.610
<v Speaker 8>assistant would be accused of breaking </v>
<v Speaker 8>provincial and federal laws.</v>

629
00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:51.593
<v Speaker 8>Bill see 16 specifically for daring to </v>
<v Speaker 8>show a video about people discussing </v>

630
00:35:56.551 --> 00:36:01.140
<v Speaker 8>such issues on a public television </v>
<v Speaker 8>station and then also accused of being a</v>

631
00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:02.153
<v Speaker 8>transform,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which is let it be noted now a crime </v>

632
00:36:05.251 --> 00:36:09.240
<v Speaker 8>under the criminal code provisions of </v>
<v Speaker 8>Bill See 16 furthermore,</v>

633
00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:13.710
<v Speaker 8>in the aftermath of her release of this </v>
<v Speaker 8>discussion,</v>

634
00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:19.040
<v Speaker 8>shepherd was accused of all of the right</v>
<v Speaker 8>wing attributes that had been leveled at</v>

635
00:36:20.071 --> 00:36:20.904
<v Speaker 8>me,</v>
<v Speaker 8>all of which are also arguably </v>

636
00:36:24.090 --> 00:36:24.923
<v Speaker 8>prosecutable under the ages of bill see </v>
<v Speaker 8>16 now we don't want to underemphasize </v>

637
00:36:31.921 --> 00:36:32.754
<v Speaker 8>the importance of this.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Remember that these were two faculty </v>

638
00:36:34.621 --> 00:36:37.830
<v Speaker 8>members and as well and administrator </v>
<v Speaker 8>Andrea Joel,</v>

639
00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:42.900
<v Speaker 8>who is hired precisely for this purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So that's the first piece of evidence.</v>

640
00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:44.993
<v Speaker 8>Next we might consider the response from</v>
<v Speaker 8>others at Wilfrid laurier university </v>

641
00:36:48.391 --> 00:36:49.224
<v Speaker 8>itself as well as professors and pundits</v>
<v Speaker 8>outside that university in other </v>

642
00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:54.593
<v Speaker 8>departments and institutions.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm going to start with a letter that </v>

643
00:36:57.331 --> 00:36:58.164
<v Speaker 8>was written by 20 members of the </v>
<v Speaker 8>Department of communication studies at </v>

644
00:37:01.111 --> 00:37:03.810
<v Speaker 8>Wilfrid Laurier,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which is the same department that houses</v>

645
00:37:04.050 --> 00:37:05.640
<v Speaker 8>Ramboo,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Kana and Pimlott.</v>

646
00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:07.860
<v Speaker 8>Here's what they had to say about the </v>
<v Speaker 8>matter.</v>

647
00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:10.050
<v Speaker 8>I'm going to paraphrase.</v>

648
00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:12.953
<v Speaker 8>A meeting with shepard was secretly </v>
<v Speaker 8>recorded and sent to the media by that </v>

649
00:37:15.931 --> 00:37:17.550
<v Speaker 8>ta,</v>
<v Speaker 8>this act,</v>

650
00:37:17.551 --> 00:37:20.910
<v Speaker 8>spark columns and op eds that rushed to </v>
<v Speaker 8>assess the meeting.</v>

651
00:37:21.090 --> 00:37:24.990
<v Speaker 8>Generalizing from this single event,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a diagnosis of our program,</v>

652
00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:28.200
<v Speaker 8>the university and the state of higher </v>
<v Speaker 8>education in Canada.</v>

653
00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:29.453
<v Speaker 8>We welcome the widening range of </v>
<v Speaker 8>perspectives on this situation that are </v>

654
00:37:32.221 --> 00:37:34.410
<v Speaker 8>beginning to emerge in the public </v>
<v Speaker 8>sphere.</v>

655
00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:38.680
<v Speaker 8>We recognize that the meeting was </v>
<v Speaker 8>mishandled.</v>

656
00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:41.800
<v Speaker 8>We specifically acknowledge the power </v>
<v Speaker 8>imbalance in the meeting.</v>

657
00:37:42.070 --> 00:37:44.650
<v Speaker 8>As doctor Ramboo.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Kenna acknowledged in his open letter to</v>

658
00:37:44.651 --> 00:37:49.600
<v Speaker 8>his ta in future meetings were serious </v>
<v Speaker 8>matters pertaining to the conduct of Tas</v>

659
00:37:49.601 --> 00:37:50.434
<v Speaker 8>are under discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We acknowledged that students should be </v>

660
00:37:52.121 --> 00:37:55.030
<v Speaker 8>encouraged to bring someone representing</v>
<v Speaker 8>them and their interests.</v>

661
00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:56.073
<v Speaker 8>We would support a graduate student </v>
<v Speaker 8>initiative to unionize ta's which could </v>

662
00:37:59.501 --> 00:38:00.334
<v Speaker 8>provide student employees with a </v>
<v Speaker 8>grievance process and other forms of </v>

663
00:38:02.831 --> 00:38:06.610
<v Speaker 8>support in cases such as this one as we </v>
<v Speaker 8>understand it,</v>

664
00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:07.593
<v Speaker 8>doctor ramboo counted,</v>
<v Speaker 8>did not operate unilaterally when he </v>

665
00:38:09.521 --> 00:38:11.620
<v Speaker 8>called a meeting with his ta.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Rather,</v>

666
00:38:11.621 --> 00:38:12.454
<v Speaker 8>we believe he acted in response to a </v>
<v Speaker 8>disclosure made by one or more students </v>

667
00:38:15.221 --> 00:38:18.910
<v Speaker 8>to university offices set up to provide </v>
<v Speaker 8>confidential support.</v>

668
00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:21.880
<v Speaker 8>Upon being notified of this disclosure,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Dr Ramboo,</v>

669
00:38:21.881 --> 00:38:22.714
<v Speaker 8>Kenna as course instructor,</v>
<v Speaker 8>understood that he had a responsibility </v>

670
00:38:25.421 --> 00:38:29.470
<v Speaker 8>to act in line with university policies </v>
<v Speaker 8>including those laid out in the gendered</v>

671
00:38:29.471 --> 00:38:30.910
<v Speaker 8>and sexual violence policy.</v>

672
00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:33.460
<v Speaker 8>Now I'm going to interject here for a </v>
<v Speaker 8>minute.</v>

673
00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:34.533
<v Speaker 8>That's a very interesting because </v>
<v Speaker 8>president mcclachi has basically </v>

674
00:38:37.511 --> 00:38:38.344
<v Speaker 8>complained that Rambo counter and </v>
<v Speaker 8>Pimlott and Joel herself acted outside </v>

675
00:38:42.071 --> 00:38:44.350
<v Speaker 8>the policies that the university has </v>
<v Speaker 8>established.</v>

676
00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:45.303
<v Speaker 8>However,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the faculty members writing and </v>

677
00:38:46.271 --> 00:38:50.110
<v Speaker 8>supportive their callings claim that the</v>
<v Speaker 8>reason that Rambo County and Pimlott and</v>

678
00:38:50.111 --> 00:38:50.944
<v Speaker 8>Joel as well acted in the manner they </v>
<v Speaker 8>did was because they were following </v>

679
00:38:53.891 --> 00:38:55.900
<v Speaker 8>those policies.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So which is it?</v>

680
00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:58.450
<v Speaker 8>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 8>here's my 2 cents for what it's worth.</v>

681
00:38:58.630 --> 00:39:03.400
<v Speaker 8>My suspicions are that the policies are </v>
<v Speaker 8>written so badly like bill see 16 itself</v>

682
00:39:03.401 --> 00:39:04.234
<v Speaker 8>and the surrounding policies at the </v>
<v Speaker 8>Ontario Human Rights Commission that </v>

683
00:39:06.701 --> 00:39:09.280
<v Speaker 8>either of those interpretations are </v>
<v Speaker 8>possible.</v>

684
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:10.833
<v Speaker 8>It's convenient for the university to </v>
<v Speaker 8>disavow responsibility for the actions </v>

685
00:39:13.811 --> 00:39:14.644
<v Speaker 8>of its faculty member and it's </v>
<v Speaker 8>administrators and it's convenient for </v>

686
00:39:16.811 --> 00:39:17.644
<v Speaker 8>the faculty members and administrators </v>
<v Speaker 8>to say that they were just following </v>

687
00:39:20.201 --> 00:39:25.201
<v Speaker 8>policy and it's not clear at all that </v>
<v Speaker 8>the independent fact finding council has</v>

688
00:39:27.731 --> 00:39:29.740
<v Speaker 8>settled that to anyone's satisfaction.</v>

689
00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:31.413
<v Speaker 8>Either way,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's serious business back to the </v>

690
00:39:34.031 --> 00:39:34.864
<v Speaker 8>letter,</v>
<v Speaker 8>while the free speech of a single </v>

691
00:39:36.941 --> 00:39:40.090
<v Speaker 8>individual has dominated discussion </v>
<v Speaker 8>surrounding this situation,</v>

692
00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:43.930
<v Speaker 8>academic freedom is also a decisive term</v>
<v Speaker 8>in this context.</v>

693
00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:44.913
<v Speaker 8>Dr Rambo,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Kenna exercises academic freedom as a </v>

694
00:39:46.901 --> 00:39:47.734
<v Speaker 8>core supervisor by setting parameters </v>
<v Speaker 8>for the multiple tutorials that </v>

695
00:39:50.951 --> 00:39:51.784
<v Speaker 8>supplement his lecture.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It is within the scope of a supervising </v>

696
00:39:55.211 --> 00:39:56.044
<v Speaker 8>professors academic freedom to have </v>
<v Speaker 8>workplace meetings with Tas regarding </v>

697
00:39:58.961 --> 00:40:01.540
<v Speaker 8>how course material is taught.</v>
<v Speaker 8>All right,</v>

698
00:40:01.541 --> 00:40:06.541
<v Speaker 8>so I have to interject again.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It isn't obvious to me that this meeting</v>

699
00:40:08.290 --> 00:40:09.123
<v Speaker 8>with shepard constituted a normative </v>
<v Speaker 8>workplace meeting with a ta regarding </v>

700
00:40:14.231 --> 00:40:15.064
<v Speaker 8>how course material is taught and the </v>
<v Speaker 8>fundamental reason for that is the </v>

701
00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:21.040
<v Speaker 8>appearance at the meeting of the </v>
<v Speaker 8>administrator,</v>

702
00:40:21.041 --> 00:40:23.980
<v Speaker 8>Andrea Joel,</v>
<v Speaker 8>as well as the numerous accusations that</v>

703
00:40:23.981 --> 00:40:24.814
<v Speaker 8>were leveled at Shepherd.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So I think that that sentence is </v>

704
00:40:27.281 --> 00:40:28.990
<v Speaker 8>disingenuous.</v>
<v Speaker 8>At best.</v>

705
00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:30.093
<v Speaker 8>We maintain that the use of materials </v>
<v Speaker 8>that invite controversy into the </v>

706
00:40:32.501 --> 00:40:35.890
<v Speaker 8>classroom need to be approached with </v>
<v Speaker 8>pedagogical care and forethought.</v>

707
00:40:36.610 --> 00:40:38.680
<v Speaker 8>Public debates about freedom of </v>
<v Speaker 8>expression,</v>

708
00:40:38.830 --> 00:40:39.663
<v Speaker 8>while valuable can have a silencing </v>
<v Speaker 8>effect on the free speech of other </v>

709
00:40:42.971 --> 00:40:43.804
<v Speaker 8>members of the public.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We uphold the rights of Trans nonbinary </v>

710
00:40:46.751 --> 00:40:47.584
<v Speaker 8>and queer folk to be addressed in our </v>
<v Speaker 8>classrooms in ways that they define </v>

711
00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:53.290
<v Speaker 8>those in positions of authority in the </v>
<v Speaker 8>classroom.</v>

712
00:40:53.291 --> 00:40:54.520
<v Speaker 8>Faculty,</v>
<v Speaker 8>instructors,</v>

713
00:40:54.521 --> 00:40:58.210
<v Speaker 8>teaching assistants are not sitting </v>
<v Speaker 8>equally around the table with students.</v>

714
00:40:58.360 --> 00:40:59.193
<v Speaker 8>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they have a responsibility to foster an </v>

715
00:41:01.061 --> 00:41:03.490
<v Speaker 8>environment of mutual respect and </v>
<v Speaker 8>critical thinking.</v>

716
00:41:03.730 --> 00:41:04.563
<v Speaker 8>One wherein students should never feel </v>
<v Speaker 8>that either their grades or their </v>

717
00:41:06.761 --> 00:41:09.640
<v Speaker 8>wellbeing could be impacted because of </v>
<v Speaker 8>their gender,</v>

718
00:41:09.641 --> 00:41:10.840
<v Speaker 8>sexuality,</v>
<v Speaker 8>race,</v>

719
00:41:10.930 --> 00:41:13.300
<v Speaker 8>class,</v>
<v Speaker 8>or any other facet of their identity.</v>

720
00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:14.733
<v Speaker 8>We appreciate that our university has </v>
<v Speaker 8>mechanisms through which students who </v>

721
00:41:17.141 --> 00:41:17.974
<v Speaker 8>feel unsafe,</v>
<v Speaker 8>unfairly treated or have experienced </v>

722
00:41:20.261 --> 00:41:21.094
<v Speaker 8>intolerance in the classroom or </v>
<v Speaker 8>otherwise in the role of students can </v>

723
00:41:23.531 --> 00:41:26.200
<v Speaker 8>make appeals and find support and </v>
<v Speaker 8>resources to help them.</v>

724
00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:27.363
<v Speaker 8>We also acknowledge that we can do a </v>
<v Speaker 8>better job of making students aware of </v>

725
00:41:30.101 --> 00:41:30.934
<v Speaker 8>these mechanisms.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We are always so grateful when students </v>

726
00:41:33.441 --> 00:41:34.274
<v Speaker 8>do approach campus offices designed for </v>
<v Speaker 8>reporting problematic classroom </v>

727
00:41:37.161 --> 00:41:40.370
<v Speaker 8>situations as their courage makes us do </v>
<v Speaker 8>our jobs better.</v>

728
00:41:40.490 --> 00:41:41.323
<v Speaker 8>We thank you for coming forward.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You are such valued members of our </v>

729
00:41:43.671 --> 00:41:44.504
<v Speaker 8>community.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Charges that are program shelter </v>

730
00:41:46.321 --> 00:41:48.770
<v Speaker 8>students from real world issues or </v>
<v Speaker 8>fosters classrooms.</v>

731
00:41:48.771 --> 00:41:49.604
<v Speaker 8>Inhospitable to discussing contentious </v>
<v Speaker 8>issues from different vantage points </v>

732
00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:52.963
<v Speaker 8>seem to us simply preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We reject efforts of those who have </v>

733
00:41:56.541 --> 00:42:01.430
<v Speaker 8>seized this episode as a strategic </v>
<v Speaker 8>opportunity to disparage disciplines and</v>

734
00:42:01.431 --> 00:42:02.264
<v Speaker 8>scholars with commitments to improving </v>
<v Speaker 8>social and economic inequality within </v>

735
00:42:05.571 --> 00:42:07.910
<v Speaker 8>universities and in society.</v>
<v Speaker 8>At Large.</v>

736
00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:09.103
<v Speaker 8>Commentary on this event in the press.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And social media has emboldened </v>

737
00:42:11.631 --> 00:42:12.464
<v Speaker 8>individuals who see themselves as noble </v>
<v Speaker 8>defenders of free speech to intimidate </v>

738
00:42:15.981 --> 00:42:20.150
<v Speaker 8>our faculty and students to the point </v>
<v Speaker 8>that protective measures have been taken</v>

739
00:42:20.151 --> 00:42:22.550
<v Speaker 8>in an attempt to secure their safety.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

740
00:42:22.551 --> 00:42:25.010
<v Speaker 8>So another bit of commentary is </v>
<v Speaker 8>necessary there.</v>

741
00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:28.970
<v Speaker 8>So there was a concerted effort made by </v>
<v Speaker 8>the Neo Marxists,</v>

742
00:42:28.971 --> 00:42:29.804
<v Speaker 8>postmodern radical leftist types to </v>
<v Speaker 8>paint lindsay shepherd as the </v>

743
00:42:33.081 --> 00:42:36.650
<v Speaker 8>perpetrator and the faculty members and </v>
<v Speaker 8>administrators who were involved in this</v>

744
00:42:36.651 --> 00:42:37.484
<v Speaker 8>issue as the true victims.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And that's where this bit of </v>

745
00:42:39.381 --> 00:42:40.214
<v Speaker 8>conceptualization is coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Perhaps the most remarkable of such </v>

746
00:42:43.881 --> 00:42:47.860
<v Speaker 8>comments about shepherd was broadcast on</v>
<v Speaker 8>our national broadcaster,</v>

747
00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:49.880
<v Speaker 8>CBC,</v>
<v Speaker 8>TV Sunday,</v>

748
00:42:49.881 --> 00:42:53.360
<v Speaker 8>scrum where a number of journalists,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Vicky,</v>

749
00:42:53.361 --> 00:42:55.520
<v Speaker 8>Moshe,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Shama John Edmondson,</v>

750
00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:59.360
<v Speaker 8>and Susan Riley.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We're discussing people of the year.</v>

751
00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:04.310
<v Speaker 8>It was Vicky Mashama that made the </v>
<v Speaker 8>comments that I've clipped.</v>

752
00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:06.020
<v Speaker 9>John,</v>
<v Speaker 9>who would your pick be?</v>

753
00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:07.880
<v Speaker 9>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>another young woman,</v>

754
00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:08.913
<v Speaker 9>um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>Lindsay Shepherd who have heard a lot </v>

755
00:43:10.341 --> 00:43:11.001
<v Speaker 9>about,</v>
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

756
00:43:11.001 --> 00:43:14.060
<v Speaker 9>she was the young teaching assistant </v>
<v Speaker 9>that Laurier University,</v>

757
00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:16.520
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>who was called on the carpet for showing</v>

758
00:43:16.521 --> 00:43:18.720
<v Speaker 9>a video of Jordan Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And it was the,</v>

759
00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:19.603
<v Speaker 9>the recording of that disciplinary </v>
<v Speaker 9>hearing that went viral and that really </v>

760
00:43:23.391 --> 00:43:24.224
<v Speaker 9>exploded the whole issue of the debate </v>
<v Speaker 9>that's occurring within the social </v>

761
00:43:26.751 --> 00:43:29.900
<v Speaker 9>sciences and humanities od the right of </v>
<v Speaker 9>freedom of expression,</v>

762
00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:33.110
<v Speaker 9>the right of freedom of research versus </v>
<v Speaker 9>the right of protection,</v>

763
00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:35.480
<v Speaker 9>the right to safe spaces.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Uh,</v>

764
00:43:35.481 --> 00:43:37.840
<v Speaker 9>the right not to be a subject to </v>
<v Speaker 9>regression.</v>

765
00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:39.103
<v Speaker 9>This is a virulent debate that's </v>
<v Speaker 9>happening on university campuses across </v>

766
00:43:42.771 --> 00:43:44.090
<v Speaker 9>the country.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>

767
00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:45.860
<v Speaker 9>some of us have written about it in the </v>
<v Speaker 9>past,</v>

768
00:43:45.861 --> 00:43:47.450
<v Speaker 9>but it has to be said,</v>
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

769
00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:49.400
<v Speaker 9>well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>no matter where you are on this debate,</v>

770
00:43:49.610 --> 00:43:53.210
<v Speaker 9>it was Ms. Sheppard and that and that </v>
<v Speaker 9>tape that,</v>

771
00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:54.133
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>blue this entire issue open and made it </v>

772
00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:58.970
<v Speaker 9>a part of the national discourse.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And for that she deserves great credit.</v>

773
00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:00.513
<v Speaker 4>I disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that she is someone that exists </v>

774
00:44:03.071 --> 00:44:05.440
<v Speaker 4>and I think a lot of people responded to</v>
<v Speaker 4>her for the same reasons.</v>

775
00:44:05.441 --> 00:44:08.650
<v Speaker 4>They tend to respond to things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is that she's a young crying white</v>

776
00:44:08.651 --> 00:44:09.484
<v Speaker 4>girl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there are lots of moments in which </v>

777
00:44:10.631 --> 00:44:12.850
<v Speaker 4>the academic freedom conversation could </v>
<v Speaker 4>have been had.</v>

778
00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:13.863
<v Speaker 4>And guts has been skipped over serially.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I don't think that choosing </v>

779
00:44:17.450 --> 00:44:20.620
<v Speaker 4>appropriate person to have launched this</v>
<v Speaker 4>conversation because as it turned out,</v>

780
00:44:20.830 --> 00:44:22.180
<v Speaker 4>she leans hard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

781
00:44:22.181 --> 00:44:23.380
<v Speaker 4>and some of her choices,</v>

782
00:44:23.850 --> 00:44:25.440
<v Speaker 9>well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>whether you like when she needs or not,</v>

783
00:44:25.441 --> 00:44:26.274
<v Speaker 9>we're having this debate here on this </v>
<v Speaker 9>show now and we're having it because of </v>

784
00:44:28.891 --> 00:44:29.724
<v Speaker 9>Ms. Sheppard</v>

785
00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:33.120
<v Speaker 8>back to the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>against this politics of revenge.</v>

786
00:44:33.121 --> 00:44:33.954
<v Speaker 8>We acknowledged the moral imperative to </v>
<v Speaker 8>support and protect our colleagues and </v>

787
00:44:36.781 --> 00:44:37.614
<v Speaker 8>students.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We urge our colleagues at Lori and </v>

788
00:44:39.391 --> 00:44:43.110
<v Speaker 8>beyond to monitor carefully how this </v>
<v Speaker 8>event has been framed and taken up.</v>

789
00:44:43.590 --> 00:44:44.423
<v Speaker 8>Another bit of commentary for me.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I would also encourage colleagues at </v>

790
00:44:47.701 --> 00:44:52.020
<v Speaker 8>Lori and beyond to monitor carefully how</v>
<v Speaker 8>this event has been framed and taken up.</v>

791
00:44:52.110 --> 00:44:54.000
<v Speaker 8>I guess that's exactly what I'm doing </v>
<v Speaker 8>now.</v>

792
00:44:54.690 --> 00:44:58.650
<v Speaker 8>We agree with Lorius president that we </v>
<v Speaker 8>live in an increasingly polarized world.</v>

793
00:44:58.950 --> 00:45:02.220
<v Speaker 8>Understanding the forces and discontent </v>
<v Speaker 8>driving this polarization,</v>

794
00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:03.413
<v Speaker 8>including how they are at play in this </v>
<v Speaker 8>situation and with what consequences is </v>

795
00:45:06.151 --> 00:45:10.440
<v Speaker 8>a collective task in which we all have a</v>
<v Speaker 8>stake and 20 undersigned,</v>

796
00:45:10.441 --> 00:45:11.274
<v Speaker 8>faculty and affiliate members of the </v>
<v Speaker 8>Department of Communication Studies </v>

797
00:45:13.441 --> 00:45:14.274
<v Speaker 8>signed this.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Although the signatories of this letter </v>

798
00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:18.533
<v Speaker 8>admit that the meeting was mishandled.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They do not say much about how with the </v>

799
00:45:22.411 --> 00:45:26.610
<v Speaker 8>exception that shepherd was not provided</v>
<v Speaker 8>with independent or support.</v>

800
00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:30.630
<v Speaker 8>To the contrary,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they state that Ramboo Kana at all.</v>

801
00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:35.750
<v Speaker 8>We're simply following university </v>
<v Speaker 8>policies put in place as quote mechanism</v>

802
00:45:36.051 --> 00:45:36.884
<v Speaker 8>through which students who feel unsafe,</v>
<v Speaker 8>unfairly treated or have experienced </v>

803
00:45:40.741 --> 00:45:41.574
<v Speaker 8>intolerance in the classroom or </v>
<v Speaker 8>otherwise in the role as a student can </v>

804
00:45:45.151 --> 00:45:48.120
<v Speaker 8>make appeals and find support and </v>
<v Speaker 8>resources to help them.</v>

805
00:45:49.050 --> 00:45:49.883
<v Speaker 8>Thus,</v>
<v Speaker 8>although mcclachi and these letter </v>

806
00:45:51.841 --> 00:45:52.674
<v Speaker 8>writers both claim in their way that </v>
<v Speaker 8>this incident is not diagnostic of the </v>

807
00:45:56.821 --> 00:45:57.654
<v Speaker 8>state of the program,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the university and the state of higher </v>

808
00:46:00.961 --> 00:46:01.794
<v Speaker 8>education in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 8>both the statement from mcclatchy and </v>

809
00:46:04.591 --> 00:46:08.910
<v Speaker 8>the Department of Communications </v>
<v Speaker 8>indicate in fact that something has gone</v>

810
00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:09.953
<v Speaker 8>deeply and profoundly wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Ramboo Canada's colleagues state that </v>

811
00:46:13.711 --> 00:46:14.544
<v Speaker 8>Ramboo Canna Pimlott at all did nothing </v>
<v Speaker 8>wrong except shepherds lack of </v>

812
00:46:18.451 --> 00:46:22.140
<v Speaker 8>independent representation.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And if they did do something wrong,</v>

813
00:46:22.290 --> 00:46:26.310
<v Speaker 8>it was merely because they were </v>
<v Speaker 8>following policy which was laudatory and</v>

814
00:46:26.311 --> 00:46:30.270
<v Speaker 8>admirable in its intent,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if not in its implementation.</v>

815
00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:32.093
<v Speaker 8>Now the Wilfred Laurier a faculty </v>
<v Speaker 8>association also weighed in on this </v>

816
00:46:35.371 --> 00:46:36.204
<v Speaker 8>issue,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and here's the gist of what they had to </v>

817
00:46:38.071 --> 00:46:38.904
<v Speaker 8>say.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'll put a link to the entire letter in </v>

818
00:46:40.681 --> 00:46:41.514
<v Speaker 8>the description of this video,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but this is what they considered most </v>

819
00:46:44.521 --> 00:46:48.090
<v Speaker 8>worthy of note</v>
<v Speaker 8>to be clear.</v>

820
00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:53.120
<v Speaker 8>W L Ufa condemns the violent speech and </v>
<v Speaker 8>actions that have unfortunately become a</v>

821
00:46:53.641 --> 00:46:56.850
<v Speaker 8>daily occurrence on our campuses.</v>
<v Speaker 8>In particular,</v>

822
00:46:56.970 --> 00:46:57.803
<v Speaker 8>the harm that has been leveled at our </v>
<v Speaker 8>trans community and its supporters is </v>

823
00:47:00.631 --> 00:47:01.464
<v Speaker 8>unacceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 8>W L UFA stands in solidarity with our </v>

824
00:47:04.771 --> 00:47:05.604
<v Speaker 8>Lgbtq t community as they continue to </v>
<v Speaker 8>battle their way through walls of </v>

825
00:47:10.081 --> 00:47:10.914
<v Speaker 8>ignorance and oppression.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Walls that seem to have been </v>

826
00:47:13.081 --> 00:47:16.500
<v Speaker 8>disproportionately fortified in the last</v>
<v Speaker 8>few weeks.</v>

827
00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:17.993
<v Speaker 8>So that's commentary on then Lindsay </v>
<v Speaker 8>Shepherd affair from the faculty </v>

828
00:47:21.151 --> 00:47:21.984
<v Speaker 8>association,</v>
<v Speaker 8>representing all of the professors at </v>

829
00:47:23.821 --> 00:47:24.654
<v Speaker 8>Wilfrid laurier university.</v>
<v Speaker 8>No comment whatsoever of substance on </v>

830
00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:30.550
<v Speaker 8>the nature of the meeting itself.</v>

831
00:47:30.550 --> 00:47:31.383
<v Speaker 8>Only an expression of concern for the </v>
<v Speaker 8>hypothetically and very poorly </v>

832
00:47:34.121 --> 00:47:34.954
<v Speaker 8>documented by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 8>unsafe conditions for faculty and </v>

833
00:47:38.291 --> 00:47:39.124
<v Speaker 8>students that have arisen at Wilfrid </v>
<v Speaker 8>laurier university in the aftermath of </v>

834
00:47:42.341 --> 00:47:44.500
<v Speaker 8>the release of shepherds tape of the </v>
<v Speaker 8>meeting.</v>

835
00:47:45.550 --> 00:47:46.383
<v Speaker 8>Now I said that I was speaking to junior</v>
<v Speaker 8>high and high school students at the </v>

836
00:47:49.481 --> 00:47:50.314
<v Speaker 8>beginning of this video and so far I've </v>
<v Speaker 8>only talked about the state of our </v>

837
00:47:53.591 --> 00:47:54.424
<v Speaker 8>universities,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but I'm doing this and providing this </v>

838
00:47:56.531 --> 00:47:57.364
<v Speaker 8>extensive background because </v>
<v Speaker 8>universities provide the teachers for </v>

839
00:47:59.921 --> 00:48:00.754
<v Speaker 8>our public schools as well as the </v>
<v Speaker 8>destination place for the most </v>

840
00:48:03.731 --> 00:48:07.120
<v Speaker 8>academically able of the students who </v>
<v Speaker 8>come through the school system.</v>

841
00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:11.110
<v Speaker 8>Thus,</v>
<v Speaker 8>before making my recommendations,</v>

842
00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:12.213
<v Speaker 8>which I will do with all seriousness,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I have to document my discontent </v>

843
00:48:15.701 --> 00:48:16.534
<v Speaker 8>thoroughly.</v>

844
00:48:18.430 --> 00:48:19.263
<v Speaker 8>I'm therefore going to talk about the </v>
<v Speaker 8>response to the shepherd if they're </v>

845
00:48:21.911 --> 00:48:26.860
<v Speaker 8>outside of Wilfrid laurier university </v>
<v Speaker 8>before returning to the point at hand.</v>

846
00:48:27.670 --> 00:48:28.503
<v Speaker 8>I'm doing that to demonstrate that the </v>
<v Speaker 8>state of affairs indicated by Lindsay </v>

847
00:48:33.281 --> 00:48:37.300
<v Speaker 8>shepherds tape is by no means unique to </v>
<v Speaker 8>Wilford Lori a itself.</v>

848
00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:42.670
<v Speaker 8>I'm going to start with a few video </v>
<v Speaker 8>clips featuring professor Rinaldo,</v>

849
00:48:42.671 --> 00:48:43.504
<v Speaker 8>a wall caught of the women and Gender </v>
<v Speaker 8>Studies Institute at the Ontario </v>

850
00:48:47.830 --> 00:48:52.830
<v Speaker 8>Institute for the studies of Education.</v>
<v Speaker 8>These clips are taken once again,</v>

851
00:48:53.081 --> 00:48:57.190
<v Speaker 8>interestingly enough from TV shows the </v>
<v Speaker 8>agenda with Steve Pakan.</v>

852
00:48:57.670 --> 00:49:01.480
<v Speaker 8>Walcott recently appeared on the agenda </v>
<v Speaker 8>to discuss the events.</v>

853
00:49:01.630 --> 00:49:02.463
<v Speaker 8>I'm speaking with you about today.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I chose to highlight Walcott because </v>

854
00:49:06.731 --> 00:49:07.564
<v Speaker 8>he's director of the women and Gender </v>
<v Speaker 8>Studies Institute at the Ontario </v>

855
00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:13.480
<v Speaker 8>Institute for the studies of Education </v>
<v Speaker 8>and oil.</v>

856
00:49:13.481 --> 00:49:14.314
<v Speaker 8>Z as it's known is perhaps the most </v>
<v Speaker 8>influential educational institute </v>

857
00:49:18.550 --> 00:49:19.383
<v Speaker 8>concerned with Public School curriculum </v>
<v Speaker 8>in all of Canada and therefore an </v>

858
00:49:23.051 --> 00:49:23.884
<v Speaker 8>organization whose decisions are of </v>
<v Speaker 8>critical importance for determining the </v>

859
00:49:28.241 --> 00:49:29.074
<v Speaker 8>nature of what's taught from </v>
<v Speaker 8>kindergarten all the way through high </v>

860
00:49:32.231 --> 00:49:34.210
<v Speaker 8>school,</v>
<v Speaker 8>not only in Ontario,</v>

861
00:49:34.211 --> 00:49:38.080
<v Speaker 8>but because of its influence all across </v>
<v Speaker 8>Canada and perhaps beyond.</v>

862
00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:39.303
<v Speaker 8>I firmly believe that Walcott's attitude</v>
<v Speaker 8>is indicative of the ideological stance </v>

863
00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:46.593
<v Speaker 8>that characterizes the philosophy that </v>
<v Speaker 8>is taught to those who will be the </v>

864
00:49:50.981 --> 00:49:51.814
<v Speaker 8>teachers of young people in the public </v>
<v Speaker 8>school system in Canada from </v>

865
00:49:54.791 --> 00:49:56.410
<v Speaker 8>kindergarten through high school.</v>

866
00:49:58.720 --> 00:49:59.553
<v Speaker 4>The incidents at Wilfrid laurier </v>
<v Speaker 4>university have certainly provoked a </v>

867
00:50:01.701 --> 00:50:02.534
<v Speaker 4>debate within academia and beyond on </v>
<v Speaker 4>finding that sweet spot between freedom </v>

868
00:50:06.441 --> 00:50:09.530
<v Speaker 4>of expression and respecting the </v>
<v Speaker 4>diversity of the student body.</v>

869
00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:13.280
<v Speaker 4>Is it possible to satisfy both of those </v>
<v Speaker 4>legitimate aims?</v>

870
00:50:13.730 --> 00:50:16.610
<v Speaker 4>Let's find out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can we welcome in alphabetical order?</v>

871
00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:21.410
<v Speaker 4>Shannon Day professor of philosophy at </v>
<v Speaker 4>University of Waterloo and Mcfarland,</v>

872
00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:24.020
<v Speaker 4>professor of political science,</v>
<v Speaker 4>University of Waterloo,</v>

873
00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:26.930
<v Speaker 4>Thomas Merit Canada research chair in </v>
<v Speaker 4>genomics,</v>

874
00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:28.100
<v Speaker 4>bioinformatics</v>

875
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:31.010
<v Speaker 10>at Laurentian University in Sudbury,</v>
<v Speaker 10>Janice Stein,</v>

876
00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:31.933
<v Speaker 10>founding director of the Munk School of </v>
<v Speaker 10>global affairs at the University of </v>

877
00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:35.323
<v Speaker 10>Toronto and Rinaldo Walcott,</v>
<v Speaker 10>associate professor in social justice </v>

878
00:50:38.211 --> 00:50:39.044
<v Speaker 10>education at Oise,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the Ontario Institute for Studies in </v>

879
00:50:41.781 --> 00:50:42.770
<v Speaker 10>education.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Okay,</v>

880
00:50:42.771 --> 00:50:46.140
<v Speaker 10>so a couple of things we want to answer </v>
<v Speaker 10>that I'd take the loan lung for you on a</v>

881
00:50:46.141 --> 00:50:46.974
<v Speaker 10>desk.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So what do we are actually fan today in </v>

882
00:50:48.771 --> 00:50:49.604
<v Speaker 10>2017 it's a long cultural award.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I had new wage in a university in the </v>

883
00:50:54.050 --> 00:50:54.883
<v Speaker 10>60s when women studies and I happened to</v>
<v Speaker 10>be the director of lemming studies at </v>

884
00:50:56.841 --> 00:50:57.674
<v Speaker 10>the same university as Janice when </v>
<v Speaker 10>women's studies and black studies broke </v>

885
00:51:00.471 --> 00:51:01.304
<v Speaker 10>into the North American University.</v>
<v Speaker 10>That's been a consistent push against </v>

886
00:51:05.751 --> 00:51:06.584
<v Speaker 10>them from the 60s on until the present.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And part of this debate around free </v>

887
00:51:10.401 --> 00:51:11.234
<v Speaker 10>speech around academic freedom are ways </v>
<v Speaker 10>to diminish the fundamental impact of </v>

888
00:51:15.471 --> 00:51:16.304
<v Speaker 10>women's studies and black studies and </v>
<v Speaker 10>other ethnic studies has had on the </v>

889
00:51:18.621 --> 00:51:21.890
<v Speaker 10>university all the way up to having </v>
<v Speaker 10>women as presidents.</v>

890
00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:24.500
<v Speaker 10>And Bim and that's vice presidents in </v>
<v Speaker 10>writing institutions.</v>

891
00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:26.990
<v Speaker 10>I teach difficult material all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 10>My students,</v>

892
00:51:26.991 --> 00:51:29.510
<v Speaker 10>I don't have to give trigger warnings,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I don't have to do any of that.</v>

893
00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:33.200
<v Speaker 10>It's not about what's in our books </v>
<v Speaker 10>that's at stake here.</v>

894
00:51:33.350 --> 00:51:36.800
<v Speaker 10>It's about a reframing of the university</v>
<v Speaker 10>where people like myself,</v>

895
00:51:36.801 --> 00:51:37.634
<v Speaker 10>indigenous people,</v>
<v Speaker 10>Queer people are making a demand on an </v>

896
00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:40.933
<v Speaker 10>institution that had headed to a </v>
<v Speaker 10>previously locked us out and we're </v>

897
00:51:43.851 --> 00:51:44.684
<v Speaker 10>seeing that our voices matter too and </v>
<v Speaker 10>we're saying that the ways in which the </v>

898
00:51:47.991 --> 00:51:48.824
<v Speaker 10>languages of academic freedom and free </v>
<v Speaker 10>and free speech have been framed within </v>

899
00:51:51.801 --> 00:51:52.634
<v Speaker 10>the context of the university has often </v>
<v Speaker 10>provided pathways in particular for </v>

900
00:51:56.331 --> 00:51:59.060
<v Speaker 10>straight white men to say really cruel,</v>
<v Speaker 10>harmful,</v>

901
00:51:59.061 --> 00:51:59.894
<v Speaker 10>hurtful things and words do hurt and now</v>
<v Speaker 10>we're responding to that and we're </v>

902
00:52:03.651 --> 00:52:04.400
<v Speaker 10>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 10>no,</v>

903
00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:05.233
<v Speaker 10>this can't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 10>This kind of happened in our workplaces </v>

904
00:52:07.130 --> 00:52:08.210
<v Speaker 10>where we come to,</v>
<v Speaker 10>where we are,</v>

905
00:52:08.211 --> 00:52:09.770
<v Speaker 10>where we come to study and so on.</v>

906
00:52:09.890 --> 00:52:10.723
<v Speaker 10>This is a cultural war that's being </v>
<v Speaker 10>waged within a particular institution </v>

907
00:52:13.370 --> 00:52:14.810
<v Speaker 10>and we should be extremely clear about </v>
<v Speaker 10>that.</v>

908
00:52:14.990 --> 00:52:15.823
<v Speaker 10>This is a pushback against the way in </v>
<v Speaker 10>which academic scholarship as actually </v>

909
00:52:19.311 --> 00:52:20.144
<v Speaker 10>revealed on the opinions of the </v>
<v Speaker 10>university as a kind of white </v>

910
00:52:22.431 --> 00:52:26.330
<v Speaker 10>supremacists logic or senior </v>
<v Speaker 10>administrators jump into pr mode.</v>

911
00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:27.343
<v Speaker 10>Not to address what's happening inside </v>
<v Speaker 10>in Firstie but to quell the Shelton </v>

912
00:52:30.531 --> 00:52:33.230
<v Speaker 10>voiseys largely of the right way.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Outside university.</v>

913
00:52:33.410 --> 00:52:36.050
<v Speaker 10>I see this everyday at my university at </v>
<v Speaker 10>University of Toronto.</v>

914
00:52:36.190 --> 00:52:38.210
<v Speaker 10>We have the ongoing Jordan Peterson </v>
<v Speaker 10>matter,</v>

915
00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:39.133
<v Speaker 10>right?</v>
<v Speaker 10>Their response is not been to say </v>

916
00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:42.410
<v Speaker 10>women's studies,</v>
<v Speaker 10>Black Studies,</v>

917
00:52:42.411 --> 00:52:43.244
<v Speaker 10>African studies.</v>
<v Speaker 10>These kinds of studies have been </v>

918
00:52:45.411 --> 00:52:47.510
<v Speaker 10>tremendous contributions to the </v>
<v Speaker 10>university.</v>

919
00:52:47.690 --> 00:52:48.523
<v Speaker 10>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 10>there's been a profound silence as </v>

920
00:52:50.511 --> 00:52:51.344
<v Speaker 10>though the work that folks who work in </v>
<v Speaker 10>those areas do does not matter that </v>

921
00:52:54.201 --> 00:52:55.034
<v Speaker 10>overwatch,</v>
<v Speaker 10>all wealth and generative intellectual </v>

922
00:52:58.460 --> 00:53:02.360
<v Speaker 10>spirit serve the university and that </v>
<v Speaker 10>that is their fundamental flaw.</v>

923
00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:03.343
<v Speaker 10>That where we've seen our senior </v>
<v Speaker 10>administrators become managers in favor </v>

924
00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:11.090
<v Speaker 10>of the donors in favor of a secured </v>
<v Speaker 10>right wing mom,</v>

925
00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:12.073
<v Speaker 10>you'll never see the soul call laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Actually getting that kind of response </v>

926
00:53:14.361 --> 00:53:15.194
<v Speaker 10>from university administrators don't </v>
<v Speaker 10>agree with you and another one that I </v>

927
00:53:18.441 --> 00:53:21.320
<v Speaker 10>think it's much more subtle and it's </v>
<v Speaker 10>much more complex.</v>

928
00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:22.783
<v Speaker 10>Actually the role of your receipt </v>
<v Speaker 10>administrators is not get into those </v>

929
00:53:26.731 --> 00:53:28.320
<v Speaker 10>debates.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Um,</v>

930
00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:32.970
<v Speaker 10>what really matters is that all the </v>
<v Speaker 10>programs you talked about,</v>

931
00:53:32.971 --> 00:53:34.860
<v Speaker 10>which are very important,</v>
<v Speaker 10>and from my perspective,</v>

932
00:53:34.861 --> 00:53:37.530
<v Speaker 10>a core part of the university,</v>
<v Speaker 10>um,</v>

933
00:53:37.620 --> 00:53:38.453
<v Speaker 10>thrive if and faculty members and </v>
<v Speaker 10>students feel free to come into the </v>

934
00:53:43.021 --> 00:53:43.854
<v Speaker 10>classroom and have these debates,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the role of university administrators </v>

935
00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:49.193
<v Speaker 10>fundamentally beyond everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And many of them are scars in their own </v>

936
00:53:51.931 --> 00:53:52.764
<v Speaker 10>right,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but their role in their current jobs is </v>

937
00:53:54.871 --> 00:53:57.870
<v Speaker 10>to protect those rights.</v>
<v Speaker 10>But what I'll say to there,</v>

938
00:53:58.700 --> 00:54:03.360
<v Speaker 10>there's silence is an abrogation of </v>
<v Speaker 10>those rights by their very silence,</v>

939
00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:04.590
<v Speaker 10>by the very silence.</v>

940
00:54:04.630 --> 00:54:05.463
<v Speaker 10>What they're saying is that some of the </v>
<v Speaker 10>voices matter more than others within </v>

941
00:54:08.311 --> 00:54:10.080
<v Speaker 10>the context of the institution.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Think that's true.</v>

942
00:54:10.210 --> 00:54:10.801
<v Speaker 10>I,</v>
<v Speaker 10>well,</v>

943
00:54:10.801 --> 00:54:11.634
<v Speaker 10>we fundamentally disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Let's look what the University of </v>

944
00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:15.870
<v Speaker 10>Toronto,</v>
<v Speaker 10>one concrete example did.</v>

945
00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:19.650
<v Speaker 10>And when Jordan Peterson's work became </v>
<v Speaker 10>very controversial,</v>

946
00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:22.380
<v Speaker 10>they did what he versus she do.</v>
<v Speaker 10>They organize the debate</v>

947
00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:26.500
<v Speaker 10>that was fundamentally flawed.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And Jordan Peterson,</v>

948
00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:28.590
<v Speaker 10>it was not even the question of Jordan </v>
<v Speaker 10>Peterson his work,</v>

949
00:54:28.650 --> 00:54:31.260
<v Speaker 10>because he doesn't work in the areas </v>
<v Speaker 10>that he's claiming to criticize.</v>

950
00:54:32.020 --> 00:54:33.900
<v Speaker 10>He does.</v>
<v Speaker 10>He has no expertise in them.</v>

951
00:54:34.090 --> 00:54:34.923
<v Speaker 10>If I as a black faculty,</v>
<v Speaker 10>University of Toronto had engage in the </v>

952
00:54:37.141 --> 00:54:37.974
<v Speaker 10>kinds of things that Jordan Peterson </v>
<v Speaker 10>engaged and I am sure I would have been </v>

953
00:54:40.591 --> 00:54:45.180
<v Speaker 10>drummed out of the university.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I think we're sidestepping the issue.</v>

954
00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:46.433
<v Speaker 10>The issue is really one about the,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the role that university has played in </v>

955
00:54:49.681 --> 00:54:50.514
<v Speaker 10>helping to purchase the very kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 10>oppressions that many of us teach them </v>

956
00:54:53.161 --> 00:54:53.580
<v Speaker 10>research.</v>

957
00:54:53.580 --> 00:54:54.413
<v Speaker 10>Right now the university is deeply </v>
<v Speaker 10>implicated and producing certain kinds </v>

958
00:54:57.511 --> 00:55:00.720
<v Speaker 10>of logics of white supremacy and if we </v>
<v Speaker 10>don't grapple with that,</v>

959
00:55:00.750 --> 00:55:01.583
<v Speaker 10>then we can actually begin to grapple </v>
<v Speaker 10>with the claims that people who have </v>

960
00:55:04.171 --> 00:55:06.570
<v Speaker 10>been tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 10>who have been consistently oppressed and</v>

961
00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:07.433
<v Speaker 10>Chateaux now entering into the </v>
<v Speaker 10>university are making claims on that </v>

962
00:55:10.261 --> 00:55:11.094
<v Speaker 10>institution to better respond to them.</v>
<v Speaker 10>This is what this is fundamentally </v>

963
00:55:14.221 --> 00:55:17.550
<v Speaker 10>about,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but also I would say to you Steve,</v>

964
00:55:17.670 --> 00:55:18.503
<v Speaker 10>that what happens is it's not from </v>
<v Speaker 10>women's studies and black studies that </v>

965
00:55:20.761 --> 00:55:21.594
<v Speaker 10>these,</v>
<v Speaker 10>that these kinds of things emerge from </v>

966
00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:24.293
<v Speaker 10>if neutrally from white male scholars by</v>
<v Speaker 10>the majority often making claims about </v>

967
00:55:28.561 --> 00:55:30.660
<v Speaker 10>things for which they have no expertise </v>
<v Speaker 10>in.</v>

968
00:55:30.900 --> 00:55:35.130
<v Speaker 10>And then we find the entire institution </v>
<v Speaker 10>coming into place to support their right</v>

969
00:55:35.131 --> 00:55:38.210
<v Speaker 10>to speech.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Fundamentally a prosthetic you argued in</v>

970
00:55:38.220 --> 00:55:39.990
<v Speaker 10>seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 10>um,</v>

971
00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:40.853
<v Speaker 10>and engage and say if there are scholars</v>
<v Speaker 10>in the university who have no expertise </v>

972
00:55:45.810 --> 00:55:46.643
<v Speaker 10>as you claim who are speaking and </v>
<v Speaker 10>writing about things which they are not </v>

973
00:55:52.050 --> 00:55:52.883
<v Speaker 10>really qualified to speak about,</v>
<v Speaker 10>is precisely when there's free debate </v>

974
00:55:57.781 --> 00:55:58.614
<v Speaker 10>and academic freedom at that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 10>shotty work is exposed and that's where </v>

975
00:56:03.121 --> 00:56:04.890
<v Speaker 10>I want to agree with what it is.</v>

976
00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:09.180
<v Speaker 10>A marketplace of free ideas has not </v>
<v Speaker 10>consistently worked for nonwhite people.</v>

977
00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:10.890
<v Speaker 10>You should be honest about that.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I think that,</v>

978
00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:11.740
<v Speaker 10>I think we're,</v>
<v Speaker 10>we're,</v>

979
00:56:11.740 --> 00:56:12.451
<v Speaker 10>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 10>again,</v>

980
00:56:12.451 --> 00:56:15.030
<v Speaker 10>there's a confusion here,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I think having,</v>

981
00:56:15.210 --> 00:56:19.130
<v Speaker 10>you call it marketplace and I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I call an an a Gora,</v>

982
00:56:19.170 --> 00:56:22.920
<v Speaker 10>which is a different thing,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but an open public square,</v>

983
00:56:22.930 --> 00:56:26.860
<v Speaker 10>not a marketplace and open public square</v>
<v Speaker 10>of free debate,</v>

984
00:56:26.861 --> 00:56:30.480
<v Speaker 10>not only for faculty members where </v>
<v Speaker 10>academic freedom has me,</v>

985
00:56:30.670 --> 00:56:33.460
<v Speaker 10>but for students.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Students also have to be,</v>

986
00:56:33.461 --> 00:56:37.780
<v Speaker 10>feel free to say things that maybe </v>
<v Speaker 10>unpopular,</v>

987
00:56:37.900 --> 00:56:40.930
<v Speaker 10>maybe unconventional,</v>
<v Speaker 10>maybe risky.</v>

988
00:56:41.060 --> 00:56:42.340
<v Speaker 10>Not Illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 10>No,</v>

989
00:56:42.341 --> 00:56:43.950
<v Speaker 10>of course not.</v>
<v Speaker 10>A Waco,</v>

990
00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:44.933
<v Speaker 10>right.</v>
<v Speaker 10>We have marketplaces and a gorgeous </v>

991
00:56:46.841 --> 00:56:50.020
<v Speaker 10>where people didn't debate other </v>
<v Speaker 10>people's humanity as well.</v>

992
00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:50.973
<v Speaker 10>Right now what we do is in classrooms we</v>
<v Speaker 10>have people debate whether or not trans </v>

993
00:56:54.041 --> 00:56:55.810
<v Speaker 10>identities are are,</v>
<v Speaker 10>are,</v>

994
00:56:55.830 --> 00:56:56.663
<v Speaker 10>are,</v>
<v Speaker 10>are,</v>

995
00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:01.810
<v Speaker 10>but that's how universities evolve and </v>
<v Speaker 10>that's how they improve.</v>

996
00:57:01.850 --> 00:57:02.683
<v Speaker 10>Second evolve,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but also saying that some things are </v>

997
00:57:04.181 --> 00:57:05.350
<v Speaker 10>intolerable.</v>
<v Speaker 10>What?</v>

998
00:57:05.390 --> 00:57:09.610
<v Speaker 10>What is the fear of saying that some </v>
<v Speaker 10>forms of speech and tolerable in a world</v>

999
00:57:09.611 --> 00:57:10.444
<v Speaker 10>where we already have limits on speech,</v>
<v Speaker 10>we've seen it happening in the first </v>

1000
00:57:13.481 --> 00:57:14.440
<v Speaker 10>year.</v>
<v Speaker 10>BDS,</v>

1001
00:57:14.441 --> 00:57:16.260
<v Speaker 10>we've seen it happen.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Israeli apartheid week.</v>

1002
00:57:16.420 --> 00:57:20.410
<v Speaker 10>We've seen the university and many </v>
<v Speaker 10>skillful kinds of ways limit speech.</v>

1003
00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:22.660
<v Speaker 10>Clearly it's morally and ethically </v>
<v Speaker 10>bankrupt.</v>

1004
00:57:22.661 --> 00:57:27.610
<v Speaker 10>The petitions in has harsh terms as I </v>
<v Speaker 10>can to debate other people's humanity.</v>

1005
00:57:27.910 --> 00:57:28.743
<v Speaker 10>If we can't begin there,</v>
<v Speaker 10>then there's something fundamentally </v>

1006
00:57:31.631 --> 00:57:33.420
<v Speaker 10>wrong with the university as an </v>
<v Speaker 10>institution.</v>

1007
00:57:33.490 --> 00:57:37.750
<v Speaker 10>This seemed to be one of the confusing </v>
<v Speaker 10>aspects of the situation at Aa in so far</v>

1008
00:57:37.751 --> 00:57:42.751
<v Speaker 10>as one of the professors who was </v>
<v Speaker 10>upgrading the teaching assistant for the</v>

1009
00:57:43.691 --> 00:57:44.524
<v Speaker 10>way she conducted the class didn't seem </v>
<v Speaker 10>to understand what the Canadian human </v>

1010
00:57:47.921 --> 00:57:52.360
<v Speaker 10>rights code prevented or didn't prevent,</v>
<v Speaker 10>covered or didn't cover.</v>

1011
00:57:52.690 --> 00:57:55.570
<v Speaker 10>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 10>do you wonder whether faculty need a bit</v>

1012
00:57:55.571 --> 00:57:58.630
<v Speaker 10>of a refresher on what's legal or </v>
<v Speaker 10>illegal in their classrooms?</v>

1013
00:57:58.750 --> 00:57:59.583
<v Speaker 10>And let's say his name,</v>
<v Speaker 10>Professor Rambo Cooker found himself in </v>

1014
00:58:02.321 --> 00:58:03.154
<v Speaker 10>a very difficult situation.</v>
<v Speaker 10>He's also an untenured man of color and </v>

1015
00:58:06.611 --> 00:58:09.280
<v Speaker 10>we know I've been a professor for over </v>
<v Speaker 10>two decades.</v>

1016
00:58:09.490 --> 00:58:11.130
<v Speaker 10>I know that as a,</v>
<v Speaker 10>yeah,</v>

1017
00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:13.060
<v Speaker 10>on tenured black professor,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but I'm,</v>

1018
00:58:13.061 --> 00:58:13.894
<v Speaker 10>I had white ta's that often felt that </v>
<v Speaker 10>they could do the course better than I </v>

1019
00:58:16.661 --> 00:58:17.494
<v Speaker 10>could too.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And they often overstretched their own </v>

1020
00:58:19.751 --> 00:58:20.584
<v Speaker 10>responsibilities as tas.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I am sure that in the context of this </v>

1021
00:58:23.621 --> 00:58:24.454
<v Speaker 10>one particular instance that there's </v>
<v Speaker 10>much more surrounding that professors </v>

1022
00:58:27.971 --> 00:58:28.804
<v Speaker 10>all experience with this young white </v>
<v Speaker 10>woman that share race isn't parliaments </v>

1023
00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:34.930
<v Speaker 10>peaks to this longer deeper histories </v>
<v Speaker 10>again,</v>

1024
00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:38.020
<v Speaker 10>that the best academic and scholarly </v>
<v Speaker 10>work in women's studies,</v>

1025
00:58:38.021 --> 00:58:38.854
<v Speaker 10>black studies and and otherwise I'm </v>
<v Speaker 10>going to have to use this term sub all </v>

1026
00:58:40.901 --> 00:58:43.240
<v Speaker 10>disciplines raising,</v>
<v Speaker 10>which is that,</v>

1027
00:58:43.241 --> 00:58:45.640
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 10>we see that kind of response when it's a</v>

1028
00:58:45.641 --> 00:58:46.510
<v Speaker 10>young white woman.</v>

1029
00:58:46.630 --> 00:58:49.930
<v Speaker 10>We see that kind of response when it's a</v>
<v Speaker 10>white woman in parliament.</v>

1030
00:58:50.260 --> 00:58:52.690
<v Speaker 10>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 10>And it's not just about hypocrisy.</v>

1031
00:58:52.870 --> 00:58:57.670
<v Speaker 10>It's about a log embedded history of </v>
<v Speaker 10>home matters who counts.</v>

1032
00:58:57.850 --> 00:59:01.630
<v Speaker 10>This is about a culture war where we're,</v>
<v Speaker 10>we're representative.</v>

1033
00:59:01.631 --> 00:59:02.464
<v Speaker 10>Democracies have had to yield more space</v>
<v Speaker 10>that people who've been normally shut </v>

1034
00:59:06.821 --> 00:59:07.654
<v Speaker 10>out and as we come into these </v>
<v Speaker 10>institutions and we asked for their </v>

1035
00:59:11.111 --> 00:59:13.840
<v Speaker 10>transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 10>things are beginning to fray.</v>

1036
00:59:13.980 --> 00:59:17.650
<v Speaker 10>Much of this is about the Christ of </v>
<v Speaker 10>Whiteness taking place in the context of</v>

1037
00:59:17.651 --> 00:59:19.510
<v Speaker 10>the university is the crisis of </v>
<v Speaker 10>Whiteness.</v>

1038
00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:22.130
<v Speaker 10>The crisis of whiteness is that white </v>
<v Speaker 10>people are no longer</v>

1039
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:24.890
<v Speaker 11>allowed to simply say and behave in ways</v>
<v Speaker 11>that they could.</v>

1040
00:59:24.891 --> 00:59:25.724
<v Speaker 11>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 11>in the 50s in the context of the </v>

1041
00:59:26.691 --> 00:59:28.760
<v Speaker 11>university,</v>
<v Speaker 11>we not push back on it.</v>

1042
00:59:28.850 --> 00:59:31.600
<v Speaker 11>We now call the illegitimate.</v>
<v Speaker 11>We now call it intolerable.</v>

1043
00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:37.040
<v Speaker 11>Now that we've talked about universities</v>
<v Speaker 11>and those who teach the teachers and the</v>

1044
00:59:37.041 --> 00:59:37.874
<v Speaker 11>ideology that possesses them say,</v>
<v Speaker 11>we're going to move a little bit closer </v>

1045
00:59:41.121 --> 00:59:41.954
<v Speaker 11>to the school system itself.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I want to focus on the elementary </v>

1046
00:59:44.811 --> 00:59:45.644
<v Speaker 11>teachers,</v>
<v Speaker 11>Federation of Ontario and the Toronto </v>

1047
00:59:48.620 --> 00:59:49.453
<v Speaker 11>District School Board.</v>
<v Speaker 11>These are institutions that are unique </v>

1048
00:59:51.801 --> 00:59:52.634
<v Speaker 11>in some senses to Ontario,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but I believe they are reflective or </v>

1049
00:59:55.881 --> 00:59:56.714
<v Speaker 11>perhaps even lead the way in the </v>
<v Speaker 11>development of the kind of curricula </v>

1050
00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:00.553
<v Speaker 11>that are or soon will be used to cross </v>
<v Speaker 11>Canada and the rest of the Western </v>

1051
01:00:04.071 --> 01:00:07.370
<v Speaker 11>world.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Given how fast information now travels.</v>

1052
01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:09.373
<v Speaker 11>The first question we might ask is what </v>
<v Speaker 11>should children and young adults be </v>

1053
01:00:13.131 --> 01:00:16.730
<v Speaker 11>taught and not taught from kindergarten </v>
<v Speaker 11>through high school?</v>

1054
01:00:17.810 --> 01:00:19.790
<v Speaker 11>My answer to that is quite straight </v>
<v Speaker 11>forward.</v>

1055
01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:20.893
<v Speaker 11>They should be taught to read and write </v>
<v Speaker 11>and speak skillfully and gracefully and </v>

1056
01:00:24.861 --> 01:00:27.830
<v Speaker 11>that should be done with a minimum of </v>
<v Speaker 11>political bias.</v>

1057
01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:32.510
<v Speaker 11>If you agree with that sentiment,</v>
<v Speaker 11>however imperfect you might find it,</v>

1058
01:00:32.750 --> 01:00:33.583
<v Speaker 11>then you need to realize that it is not </v>
<v Speaker 11>in the least the guiding principle of </v>

1059
01:00:36.501 --> 01:00:37.334
<v Speaker 11>the current public education system.</v>
<v Speaker 11>The people who are teaching your </v>

1060
01:00:40.611 --> 01:00:43.160
<v Speaker 11>children no longer believe,</v>
<v Speaker 11>for example,</v>

1061
01:00:43.250 --> 01:00:46.310
<v Speaker 11>that children can be taught without </v>
<v Speaker 11>political bias.</v>

1062
01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:47.533
<v Speaker 11>They also believe that there are </v>
<v Speaker 11>particular political viewpoints are so </v>

1063
01:00:50.001 --> 01:00:50.834
<v Speaker 11>self evidently and finally correct that </v>
<v Speaker 11>it is proper and just to concentrate on </v>

1064
01:00:55.220 --> 01:00:59.780
<v Speaker 11>inculcating them into children as early </v>
<v Speaker 11>as kindergarten regardless of what their</v>

1065
01:00:59.781 --> 01:01:01.820
<v Speaker 11>parents or anyone else might want.</v>

1066
01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:05.353
<v Speaker 11>I do not believe that this is a goal </v>
<v Speaker 11>shared by even a majority of teachers </v>

1067
01:01:09.770 --> 01:01:12.710
<v Speaker 11>and many have written to me indicating </v>
<v Speaker 11>their dissatisfaction,</v>

1068
01:01:13.250 --> 01:01:14.083
<v Speaker 11>but a small noisy domineering victim </v>
<v Speaker 11>hood claiming coterie of radically left </v>

1069
01:01:19.131 --> 01:01:19.964
<v Speaker 11>wing thinkers have commandeered the </v>
<v Speaker 11>controls and they're steering the ship </v>

1070
01:01:23.391 --> 01:01:24.224
<v Speaker 11>where they want it to go.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Screaming bloody murder if anyone dares </v>

1071
01:01:27.531 --> 01:01:28.364
<v Speaker 11>to question or worse oppose.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Both the Elementary Teachers Federation </v>

1072
01:01:34.670 --> 01:01:35.503
<v Speaker 11>of Ontario,</v>
<v Speaker 11>which operates at the provincial slash </v>

1073
01:01:36.741 --> 01:01:41.180
<v Speaker 11>state level and the Toronto District </v>
<v Speaker 11>School board which operates at the level</v>

1074
01:01:41.181 --> 01:01:42.014
<v Speaker 11>of the city have explicitly adopted a </v>
<v Speaker 11>social justice program and if </v>

1075
01:01:46.401 --> 01:01:47.234
<v Speaker 11>implemented curriculum based on its </v>
<v Speaker 11>principles from kindergarten through </v>

1076
01:01:50.301 --> 01:01:51.134
<v Speaker 11>grade eight was similar programs </v>
<v Speaker 11>operating in the remainder of junior </v>

1077
01:01:54.201 --> 01:01:55.034
<v Speaker 11>high and high school.</v>
<v Speaker 11>The ETF oh elementary teachers remember </v>

1078
01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:04.280
<v Speaker 11>is equity oriented.</v>
<v Speaker 11>This means equality of outcome,</v>

1079
01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:05.173
<v Speaker 11>not equality of opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 11>and that is a radical left wing even </v>

1080
01:02:09.051 --> 01:02:13.430
<v Speaker 11>marxists goal.</v>
<v Speaker 11>They described their own organization as</v>

1081
01:02:13.431 --> 01:02:14.264
<v Speaker 11>a quote,</v>
<v Speaker 11>Social Justice Union end quote and have </v>

1082
01:02:17.391 --> 01:02:18.224
<v Speaker 11>produced educational material aimed in </v>
<v Speaker 11>their own words at fostering a climate </v>

1083
01:02:22.501 --> 01:02:24.420
<v Speaker 11>of social justice in Ontario.</v>

1084
01:02:26.310 --> 01:02:31.310
<v Speaker 11>This material is part of the social </v>
<v Speaker 11>justice begins with me initiative,</v>

1085
01:02:31.770 --> 01:02:34.290
<v Speaker 11>the ETF,</v>
<v Speaker 11>oh elementary teachers,</v>

1086
01:02:34.291 --> 01:02:36.810
<v Speaker 11>Federation of Ontario claims.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Furthermore,</v>

1087
01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:41.940
<v Speaker 11>that the education system is a key means</v>
<v Speaker 11>of delivering messages around inclusion,</v>

1088
01:02:41.941 --> 01:02:42.774
<v Speaker 11>diversity and welcoming environments.</v>
<v Speaker 11>They have developed a curriculum of </v>

1089
01:02:46.501 --> 01:02:50.580
<v Speaker 11>children's literature aimed at </v>
<v Speaker 11>delivering precisely this message,</v>

1090
01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:51.953
<v Speaker 11>thus bending art as ideologues always </v>
<v Speaker 11>due to the purposes of propaganda </v>

1091
01:02:56.970 --> 01:03:01.170
<v Speaker 11>justified by their belief that their and</v>
<v Speaker 11>justify their means.</v>

1092
01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:02.933
<v Speaker 11>The Social Justice and equity project </v>
<v Speaker 11>encompasses all elements of the </v>

1093
01:03:06.871 --> 01:03:10.440
<v Speaker 11>curriculum including language arts,</v>
<v Speaker 11>mathematics,</v>

1094
01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:13.020
<v Speaker 11>science and technology,</v>
<v Speaker 11>and the arts.</v>

1095
01:03:14.310 --> 01:03:15.143
<v Speaker 11>Even the very act of reading is taught </v>
<v Speaker 11>from a neo Marxist slash postmodernist </v>

1096
01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:20.093
<v Speaker 11>radical left perspective as students are</v>
<v Speaker 11>encouraged after finishing a given book </v>

1097
01:03:24.510 --> 01:03:25.343
<v Speaker 11>to identify the power claims of the </v>
<v Speaker 11>author and to know which groups have </v>

1098
01:03:28.651 --> 01:03:31.680
<v Speaker 11>been excluded from consideration by that</v>
<v Speaker 11>author.</v>

1099
01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:34.373
<v Speaker 11>The Toronto District School Board for </v>
<v Speaker 11>its part has its own social justice </v>

1100
01:03:38.101 --> 01:03:41.400
<v Speaker 11>action plan committed as it is to </v>
<v Speaker 11>fairness,</v>

1101
01:03:41.430 --> 01:03:42.780
<v Speaker 11>equity,</v>
<v Speaker 11>human rights,</v>

1102
01:03:43.110 --> 01:03:45.150
<v Speaker 11>and economic egalitarianism.</v>

1103
01:03:45.750 --> 01:03:48.420
<v Speaker 11>That is the slogan of a political </v>
<v Speaker 11>manifesto,</v>

1104
01:03:48.570 --> 01:03:49.403
<v Speaker 11>not a proper statement for an </v>
<v Speaker 11>administrative board whose proper role </v>

1105
01:03:52.891 --> 01:03:55.620
<v Speaker 11>is the local governance of the education</v>
<v Speaker 11>system.</v>

1106
01:03:56.250 --> 01:04:01.250
<v Speaker 11>No matter the t d s be unabashedly </v>
<v Speaker 11>announces its progressive agenda with no</v>

1107
01:04:01.771 --> 01:04:02.604
<v Speaker 11>consideration whatsoever given to the </v>
<v Speaker 11>fact that indoctrination and education </v>

1108
01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:09.420
<v Speaker 11>exist at precyse cross-purposes to one </v>
<v Speaker 11>another.</v>

1109
01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:10.973
<v Speaker 11>Their policies continue.</v>
<v Speaker 11>The TDSB has a shared responsibility to </v>

1110
01:04:14.941 --> 01:04:18.750
<v Speaker 11>contribute to positive social change </v>
<v Speaker 11>both locally and globally.</v>

1111
01:04:19.110 --> 01:04:23.610
<v Speaker 11>Learning about and engaging in social </v>
<v Speaker 11>justice issues such as equity,</v>

1112
01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:25.920
<v Speaker 11>diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 11>abuse against women,</v>

1113
01:04:26.010 --> 01:04:26.843
<v Speaker 11>poverty reduction and Environmental Ism </v>
<v Speaker 11>will make school a more relevant and </v>

1114
01:04:30.241 --> 01:04:31.920
<v Speaker 11>meaningful for all students.</v>

1115
01:04:32.730 --> 01:04:33.490
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1116
01:04:33.490 --> 01:04:36.660
<v Speaker 11>And will also ensure as much as this can</v>
<v Speaker 11>be done by fee,</v>

1117
01:04:36.661 --> 01:04:37.494
<v Speaker 11>yet it's students within the system </v>
<v Speaker 11>adopt the political stance deemed </v>

1118
01:04:40.940 --> 01:04:44.000
<v Speaker 11>appropriate by their administrators and </v>
<v Speaker 11>teachers.</v>

1119
01:04:45.110 --> 01:04:45.943
<v Speaker 11>Now make no mistake about it.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I know perfectly well that there is a </v>

1120
01:04:49.971 --> 01:04:50.804
<v Speaker 11>need for right and left wing viewpoints,</v>
<v Speaker 11>the right as a proclivity towards </v>

1121
01:04:54.591 --> 01:04:55.424
<v Speaker 11>counterproductive stacy's and sameness </v>
<v Speaker 11>and has to be balanced by the more </v>

1122
01:04:59.181 --> 01:05:00.014
<v Speaker 11>innovative thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 11>That is part and parcel of the </v>

1123
01:05:02.121 --> 01:05:06.320
<v Speaker 11>psychological processes that also drive </v>
<v Speaker 11>left wing political belief.</v>

1124
01:05:07.250 --> 01:05:08.083
<v Speaker 11>So my objection to the indoctrination of</v>
<v Speaker 11>children by the state and city has </v>

1125
01:05:11.751 --> 01:05:12.584
<v Speaker 11>nothing specifically to do with a </v>
<v Speaker 11>dislike of the opinions of those who </v>

1126
01:05:16.191 --> 01:05:20.200
<v Speaker 11>occupy what is after all half of the </v>
<v Speaker 11>political spectrum.</v>

1127
01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:22.440
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1128
01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:27.000
<v Speaker 11>but the fact that it's such views are a </v>
<v Speaker 11>necessary part of Bellin's public debate</v>

1129
01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:27.953
<v Speaker 11>by no means justifies transforming </v>
<v Speaker 11>public education into a system of </v>

1130
01:05:31.801 --> 01:05:35.520
<v Speaker 11>indoctrination.</v>
<v Speaker 11>And that is exactly what has happened.</v>

1131
01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:39.330
<v Speaker 11>It has to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 11>It has to stop.</v>

1132
01:05:39.331 --> 01:05:40.164
<v Speaker 11>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 11>many people have already discussed with </v>

1133
01:05:41.581 --> 01:05:42.414
<v Speaker 11>me their intent to pull their children </v>
<v Speaker 11>out of the public education system </v>

1134
01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:46.193
<v Speaker 11>because of this transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but that is not the proper solution </v>

1135
01:05:50.010 --> 01:05:50.843
<v Speaker 11>assistant belongs after all to the </v>
<v Speaker 11>parents and children who use it and it </v>

1136
01:05:53.831 --> 01:05:54.664
<v Speaker 11>does not.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Right that any faction bends its </v>

1137
01:05:56.041 --> 01:05:56.874
<v Speaker 11>function to their own use.</v>
<v Speaker 11>So I'm going to recommend something </v>

1138
01:06:02.061 --> 01:06:02.894
<v Speaker 11>radical.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I have no idea how to set the </v>

1139
01:06:05.301 --> 01:06:10.100
<v Speaker 11>universities right in any simple manner.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Some of you know I've started working on</v>

1140
01:06:10.101 --> 01:06:13.730
<v Speaker 11>an online humanities university,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but that is a major project,</v>

1141
01:06:13.940 --> 01:06:16.670
<v Speaker 11>unlikely to bear fruit until years in </v>
<v Speaker 11>the future.</v>

1142
01:06:17.890 --> 01:06:18.350
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1143
01:06:18.350 --> 01:06:21.590
<v Speaker 11>the humanities as they stand broadly </v>
<v Speaker 11>speaking,</v>

1144
01:06:21.591 --> 01:06:23.030
<v Speaker 11>geography,</v>
<v Speaker 11>history,</v>

1145
01:06:23.180 --> 01:06:25.700
<v Speaker 11>languages and literature,</v>
<v Speaker 11>Gender Studies,</v>

1146
01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:29.900
<v Speaker 11>cultural studies as well as many of the </v>
<v Speaker 11>social and applied sciences,</v>

1147
01:06:30.230 --> 01:06:32.390
<v Speaker 11>anthropology,</v>
<v Speaker 11>sociology,</v>

1148
01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:37.420
<v Speaker 11>social work as well as law and the </v>
<v Speaker 11>faculties of education most specifically</v>

1149
01:06:37.970 --> 01:06:38.803
<v Speaker 11>are occupied by radical left neo </v>
<v Speaker 11>marxists who will stay in their </v>

1150
01:06:42.051 --> 01:06:44.450
<v Speaker 11>positions for decades into the future.</v>

1151
01:06:45.250 --> 01:06:46.083
<v Speaker 11>The corruption that characterizes their </v>
<v Speaker 11>academic practices has spread widely </v>

1152
01:06:49.751 --> 01:06:50.584
<v Speaker 11>into the general culture,</v>
<v Speaker 11>political and corporate as well as </v>

1153
01:06:53.351 --> 01:06:54.184
<v Speaker 11>educational.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Although it is only the latter that </v>

1154
01:06:56.261 --> 01:06:57.094
<v Speaker 11>concerns us at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I think the only real hope of </v>

1155
01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:04.060
<v Speaker 11>forestalling further deterioration of </v>
<v Speaker 11>this sort that would require,</v>

1156
01:07:04.061 --> 01:07:04.894
<v Speaker 11>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 11>large scale exodus from the public </v>

1157
01:07:06.671 --> 01:07:07.504
<v Speaker 11>school system,</v>
<v Speaker 11>which I think is inevitable if present </v>

1158
01:07:09.791 --> 01:07:13.240
<v Speaker 11>trends continue is for the users of such</v>
<v Speaker 11>systems,</v>

1159
01:07:13.330 --> 01:07:14.163
<v Speaker 11>school children and young adults and </v>
<v Speaker 11>their parents to put a stop to its </v>

1160
01:07:17.531 --> 01:07:21.880
<v Speaker 11>politicization.</v>
<v Speaker 11>We have now reviewed evidence indicating</v>

1161
01:07:21.881 --> 01:07:22.714
<v Speaker 11>widespread ideological corruption at the</v>
<v Speaker 11>level of the professoriate </v>

1162
01:07:26.650 --> 01:07:29.770
<v Speaker 11>administration,</v>
<v Speaker 11>university department,</v>

1163
01:07:30.070 --> 01:07:35.070
<v Speaker 11>University and higher education systems </v>
<v Speaker 11>in general as well as a refusal to admit</v>

1164
01:07:35.861 --> 01:07:38.680
<v Speaker 11>to that corruption and a proclivity to </v>
<v Speaker 11>name,</v>

1165
01:07:38.681 --> 01:07:43.681
<v Speaker 11>call deride shame and protest when such </v>
<v Speaker 11>issues are brought to light.</v>

1166
01:07:44.810 --> 01:07:45.120
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1167
01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:45.953
<v Speaker 11>Such corruption particularly although </v>
<v Speaker 11>not uniquely typifies the faculties of </v>

1168
01:07:50.521 --> 01:07:55.170
<v Speaker 11>education where those who teach your </v>
<v Speaker 11>children are in turn taught.</v>

1169
01:07:55.950 --> 01:07:56.783
<v Speaker 11>Because of this,</v>
<v Speaker 11>the public education system has become </v>

1170
01:07:59.521 --> 01:08:04.140
<v Speaker 11>politicized and that politicization is </v>
<v Speaker 11>broadening and deepening,</v>

1171
01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:05.213
<v Speaker 11>presenting social danger in the form of </v>
<v Speaker 11>the involuntary indoctrination of </v>

1172
01:08:09.151 --> 01:08:13.680
<v Speaker 11>children and compromising the proper </v>
<v Speaker 11>function of public education itself,</v>

1173
01:08:13.980 --> 01:08:14.813
<v Speaker 11>which is the creation,</v>
<v Speaker 11>autonomous self governing free thinking </v>

1174
01:08:18.561 --> 01:08:19.394
<v Speaker 11>individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 11>So I am recommending the following </v>

1175
01:08:22.161 --> 01:08:27.161
<v Speaker 11>concrete actions affected and concern </v>
<v Speaker 11>families should first discuss the issues</v>

1176
01:08:28.611 --> 01:08:29.444
<v Speaker 11>and formulate a plan.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I think the following two books are </v>

1177
01:08:32.691 --> 01:08:33.524
<v Speaker 11>invaluable.</v>
<v Speaker 11>One more proximately locally and one </v>

1178
01:08:36.381 --> 01:08:37.214
<v Speaker 11>more distally.</v>
<v Speaker 11>There's a book called understanding </v>

1179
01:08:39.921 --> 01:08:40.754
<v Speaker 11>postmodernism by Steven our hex.</v>
<v Speaker 11>The whole book provides a good </v>

1180
01:08:44.481 --> 01:08:45.314
<v Speaker 11>introduction to the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but the first chapter in particular </v>

1181
01:08:48.051 --> 01:08:48.884
<v Speaker 11>provides a solid overview.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I think the Gulag archipelago by </v>

1182
01:08:53.180 --> 01:08:58.040
<v Speaker 11>Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn is also required </v>
<v Speaker 11>reading for many reasons,</v>

1183
01:08:58.820 --> 01:08:59.653
<v Speaker 11>not the least of which is his masterful </v>
<v Speaker 11>analysis of the relationship between </v>

1184
01:09:03.561 --> 01:09:04.394
<v Speaker 11>radical left wing thinking and the </v>
<v Speaker 11>absolute collapse into tyranny and </v>

1185
01:09:07.881 --> 01:09:08.714
<v Speaker 11>catastrophe that characterized all such </v>
<v Speaker 11>experiments in the course of the last </v>

1186
01:09:12.441 --> 01:09:14.120
<v Speaker 11>125 years.</v>

1187
01:09:17.290 --> 01:09:22.290
<v Speaker 11>More directly,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I think students should with the backing</v>

1188
01:09:22.451 --> 01:09:23.284
<v Speaker 11>of their parents if possible,</v>
<v Speaker 11>leave their junior high and high school </v>

1189
01:09:27.131 --> 01:09:30.700
<v Speaker 11>classes.</v>
<v Speaker 11>If any of the following topics arise,</v>

1190
01:09:31.090 --> 01:09:35.740
<v Speaker 11>this means they should stand up notre </v>
<v Speaker 11>objections to the content.</v>

1191
01:09:36.460 --> 01:09:39.970
<v Speaker 11>This sounds like indoctrination to me </v>
<v Speaker 11>rather than education,</v>

1192
01:09:40.060 --> 01:09:45.060
<v Speaker 11>so I'm leaving and then leave.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Perhaps they could encourage a classmate</v>

1193
01:09:45.251 --> 01:09:49.630
<v Speaker 11>slash friend to videotape their actions </v>
<v Speaker 11>and posted on Youtube.</v>

1194
01:09:50.710 --> 01:09:54.670
<v Speaker 11>It wouldn't take very many students </v>
<v Speaker 11>performing such an act to produce a very</v>

1195
01:09:54.671 --> 01:09:55.504
<v Speaker 11>powerful effect and it is certain that </v>
<v Speaker 11>many who won't have the courage to do </v>

1196
01:09:59.231 --> 01:10:00.064
<v Speaker 11>so.</v>
<v Speaker 11>We'll agree secretly that such action </v>

1197
01:10:02.111 --> 01:10:02.944
<v Speaker 11>was necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Here are the topics I regard as </v>

1198
01:10:06.891 --> 01:10:10.280
<v Speaker 11>indicative of indoctrination rather than</v>
<v Speaker 11>education.</v>

1199
01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:12.590
<v Speaker 11>Diversity.</v>

1200
01:10:13.890 --> 01:10:14.040
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1201
01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:16.860
<v Speaker 11>Inclusivity,</v>
<v Speaker 11>equity.</v>

1202
01:10:17.940 --> 01:10:21.090
<v Speaker 11>Conveniently,</v>
<v Speaker 11>these form the acronym die,</v>

1203
01:10:21.450 --> 01:10:22.283
<v Speaker 11>which is exactly what the philosophy </v>
<v Speaker 11>underpinning their grouping and use </v>

1204
01:10:25.350 --> 01:10:30.190
<v Speaker 11>should be encouraged to do.</v>
<v Speaker 11>White privilege,</v>

1205
01:10:30.550 --> 01:10:33.910
<v Speaker 11>systemic racism,</v>
<v Speaker 11>gender.</v>

1206
01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:37.553
<v Speaker 11>I'm not claiming that there is nothing </v>
<v Speaker 11>to be learned about such topics or even </v>

1207
01:10:40.621 --> 01:10:41.454
<v Speaker 11>that they shouldn't be discussed.</v>
<v Speaker 11>What I am saying is if they are brought </v>

1208
01:10:44.221 --> 01:10:47.520
<v Speaker 11>up in an elementary,</v>
<v Speaker 11>junior high or high school classroom,</v>

1209
01:10:47.790 --> 01:10:48.623
<v Speaker 11>the odds are very high that the lesson </v>
<v Speaker 11>to be learned will be one driven by </v>

1210
01:10:52.350 --> 01:10:53.183
<v Speaker 11>ideological slash propagandistic </v>
<v Speaker 11>concerns rather than one aimed at the </v>

1211
01:10:57.211 --> 01:11:00.390
<v Speaker 11>inculcation of knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 11>wisdom or skill.</v>

1212
01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:01.960
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

1213
01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:05.500
<v Speaker 11>here are the words again,</v>
<v Speaker 11>diversity,</v>

1214
01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.760
<v Speaker 11>inclusivity,</v>
<v Speaker 11>equity,</v>

1215
01:11:10.870 --> 01:11:15.870
<v Speaker 11>white privilege,</v>
<v Speaker 11>systemic racism and gender.</v>

1216
01:11:17.450 --> 01:11:17.620
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1217
01:11:17.620 --> 01:11:19.990
<v Speaker 11>There will be mistakes made with such an</v>
<v Speaker 11>approach.</v>

1218
01:11:20.110 --> 01:11:20.943
<v Speaker 11>Some who discussed issues such as </v>
<v Speaker 11>inclusivity and equity are going to be </v>

1219
01:11:24.311 --> 01:11:25.144
<v Speaker 11>more reasonable than others,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but that does not change the fact that </v>

1220
01:11:27.671 --> 01:11:28.504
<v Speaker 11>the philosophy driving the pushing </v>
<v Speaker 11>forward of such topics is essentially </v>

1221
01:11:32.350 --> 01:11:33.183
<v Speaker 11>ideological and propaganda stick.</v>
<v Speaker 11>So I think such active resistance will </v>

1222
01:11:37.571 --> 01:11:42.571
<v Speaker 11>get the point across very effectively.</v>
<v Speaker 11>It is too bad and to just come to this,</v>

1223
01:11:44.230 --> 01:11:49.120
<v Speaker 11>but in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 11>it has think long and hard about it.</v>

1224
01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:51.223
<v Speaker 11>My feeling is this,</v>
<v Speaker 11>if effective action is not taken now to </v>

1225
01:11:54.831 --> 01:11:58.280
<v Speaker 11>counteract the politicization of the </v>
<v Speaker 11>public school curriculum,</v>

1226
01:11:58.460 --> 01:11:59.293
<v Speaker 11>the need for such action will merely </v>
<v Speaker 11>increase and it will take much more to </v>

1227
01:12:03.171 --> 01:12:07.250
<v Speaker 11>forestall the process later.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Pick your poison.</v>

1228
01:12:08.820 --> 01:12:09.120
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1229
01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:13.710
<v Speaker 11>Good luck the best you and your family </v>
<v Speaker 11>and happy new year.</v>
