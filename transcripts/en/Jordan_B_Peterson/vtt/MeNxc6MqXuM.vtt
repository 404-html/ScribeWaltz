1
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:40.660
<v Speaker 1>Hey everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here we go.</v>

2
00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:47.643
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw somebody ask right off the bat if </v>

3
00:06:50.741 --> 00:06:53.800
<v Speaker 1>there were any women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they said girls actually,</v>

4
00:06:53.801 --> 00:06:56.480
<v Speaker 1>if there are any women in the audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5
00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:59.200
<v Speaker 1>and if there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's good.</v>

6
00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:02.710
<v Speaker 1>So welcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

7
00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:08.320
<v Speaker 1>thanks to all you Patriot people for </v>
<v Speaker 1>your continued support.</v>

8
00:07:08.321 --> 00:07:10.560
<v Speaker 1>It's a really big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's made a huge difference in,</v>

9
00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:11.763
<v Speaker 1>you're a big part of the reason that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Biblical lecture was so ridiculously </v>

10
00:07:14.891 --> 00:07:15.724
<v Speaker 1>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think more than 2 million people have </v>

11
00:07:17.051 --> 00:07:17.884
<v Speaker 1>watched it so far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's success by any stretch of the </v>

12
00:07:21.641 --> 00:07:25.450
<v Speaker 1>imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's start with some questions here.</v>

13
00:07:25.451 --> 00:07:30.370
<v Speaker 1>I've got to live chat going and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we also set it up so that,</v>

14
00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:32.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had,</v>

15
00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:35.830
<v Speaker 1>we had questions taken to begin with </v>
<v Speaker 1>without people could up vote,</v>

16
00:07:35.831 --> 00:07:40.831
<v Speaker 1>which seems to be a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's start with one from practice cube.</v>

17
00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.780
<v Speaker 1>What would be a practical approach for </v>
<v Speaker 1>developing your shadow?</v>

18
00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:45.340
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good one.</v>

19
00:07:45.341 --> 00:07:46.174
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's do a little review of union </v>

20
00:07:47.231 --> 00:07:48.064
<v Speaker 1>psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first thing is if you want to know </v>

21
00:07:49.181 --> 00:07:51.670
<v Speaker 1>about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the proper sources,</v>

22
00:07:51.671 --> 00:07:56.170
<v Speaker 1>Carl Jung's collected works volume nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>volume nine,</v>

23
00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:01.330
<v Speaker 1>and there's two parts to volume nine a </v>
<v Speaker 1>and be published as separate texts.</v>

24
00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:06.750
<v Speaker 1>And volume nine is called archetypes of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the collective unconscious and the other</v>

25
00:08:07.571 --> 00:08:08.404
<v Speaker 1>one is called a ion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in archetypes of the collective </v>

26
00:08:11.951 --> 00:08:15.160
<v Speaker 1>unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a good discussion of the persona</v>

27
00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:20.161
<v Speaker 1>and the shadow and the persona you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>say is a good way of thinking about it.</v>

28
00:08:21.281 --> 00:08:22.114
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you watch all those Rom coms where </v>

29
00:08:24.101 --> 00:08:24.934
<v Speaker 1>there's always kind of a Beta male guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's being real friendly and always </v>

30
00:08:28.271 --> 00:08:29.104
<v Speaker 1>failing miserably with women because </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically he's lying to himself and to </v>

31
00:08:31.811 --> 00:08:33.190
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

32
00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:34.293
<v Speaker 1>he's a persona and a persona is the face</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you show to the world when you're </v>

33
00:08:39.701 --> 00:08:44.701
<v Speaker 1>trying to pretend and to convince </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself and others that you're,</v>

34
00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:48.190
<v Speaker 1>I would say harmless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we could say a good person,</v>

35
00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:50.590
<v Speaker 1>but a good person isn't harmless.</v>

36
00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:55.740
<v Speaker 1>A good person is capable of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

37
00:08:56.311 --> 00:08:58.410
<v Speaker 1>maybe a good person is capable of </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>

38
00:08:58.411 --> 00:09:01.770
<v Speaker 1>but is willing to hold that in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>beyonce.</v>

39
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:04.570
<v Speaker 1>I read this interesting commentary a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little while.</v>

40
00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:07.860
<v Speaker 1>I'll go on a statement by Christ in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>New Testament.</v>

41
00:09:07.861 --> 00:09:08.694
<v Speaker 1>And the statement generally interpreted </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the meek shall inherit the </v>

42
00:09:11.971 --> 00:09:12.804
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I was looking up the multiple </v>

43
00:09:14.071 --> 00:09:14.904
<v Speaker 1>translations of the word meek.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Meek is actually derived from a </v>

44
00:09:18.571 --> 00:09:19.970
<v Speaker 1>Greek word of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

45
00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:21.053
<v Speaker 1>because the Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least some of the original forms of </v>

46
00:09:23.551 --> 00:09:25.440
<v Speaker 1>the Bible were in Greek.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

47
00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:30.300
<v Speaker 1>and that word didn't exactly mean meek.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It meant something like,</v>

48
00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:31.653
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

49
00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:38.020
<v Speaker 1>those who have weapons and the ability </v>
<v Speaker 1>to use them,</v>

50
00:09:38.021 --> 00:09:38.854
<v Speaker 1>but sir,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but determined to keep them sheets will </v>

51
00:09:41.351 --> 00:09:42.184
<v Speaker 1>inherit the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that means that people who are </v>

52
00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:48.730
<v Speaker 1>capable of force,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

53
00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:53.190
<v Speaker 1>but decide not to use it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are in the proper moral position.</v>

54
00:09:53.191 --> 00:09:55.480
<v Speaker 1>And Neat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You commented on that a fair bit too.</v>

55
00:09:55.481 --> 00:09:56.314
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

56
00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:57.400
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

57
00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:58.233
<v Speaker 1>thought of most moral morality has </v>
<v Speaker 1>cowardice not because morality itself </v>

58
00:10:01.271 --> 00:10:02.104
<v Speaker 1>was cowardice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because most people who are cowards </v>

59
00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:06.603
<v Speaker 1>disguise their coward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cowardice as morality and they claim </v>

60
00:10:11.051 --> 00:10:14.350
<v Speaker 1>that they're harmlessness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is actually a consequence of their</v>

61
00:10:14.351 --> 00:10:17.080
<v Speaker 1>fear and inability to be harmful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

62
00:10:17.081 --> 00:10:21.190
<v Speaker 1>or to be dangerous is actually a sign of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their moral integrity.</v>

63
00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:24.940
<v Speaker 1>And that's a really bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

64
00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:25.923
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're an ax murderer but you don't </v>

65
00:10:27.311 --> 00:10:29.890
<v Speaker 1>have an ax,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean that your moral.</v>

66
00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:35.410
<v Speaker 1>So now with regards to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's the persona and the persona is</v>

67
00:10:35.411 --> 00:10:36.520
<v Speaker 1>the mask that you wear.</v>

68
00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:37.353
<v Speaker 1>And that's what persona means is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mask that you wear to convince yourself </v>

69
00:10:40.391 --> 00:10:42.250
<v Speaker 1>and the world that you're not a terrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>monster.</v>

70
00:10:42.251 --> 00:10:43.870
<v Speaker 1>So that when you look at yourself in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mirror,</v>

71
00:10:43.871 --> 00:10:46.210
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to run away screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

72
00:10:46.211 --> 00:10:48.340
<v Speaker 1>when you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's a bit of an overstatement,</v>

73
00:10:48.341 --> 00:10:53.341
<v Speaker 1>but [inaudible] was very interested in </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomena such as say,</v>

74
00:10:55.121 --> 00:10:55.954
<v Speaker 1>psychological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the psychological phenomena that would </v>

75
00:10:58.331 --> 00:10:59.164
<v Speaker 1>characterize the actions of someone who </v>
<v Speaker 1>might be an Auschwitz camp guard for </v>

76
00:11:02.261 --> 00:11:04.090
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

77
00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:05.853
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty monstrous form of </v>

78
00:11:06.671 --> 00:11:07.504
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the thing about Auschwitz camp </v>

79
00:11:09.821 --> 00:11:10.654
<v Speaker 1>guards is that there's no reason to </v>
<v Speaker 1>assume really that they were much </v>

80
00:11:13.931 --> 00:11:15.880
<v Speaker 1>different than normal people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

81
00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:17.710
<v Speaker 1>there would have been exceptions </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>

82
00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:18.873
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what that means is that perhaps you </v>

83
00:11:21.491 --> 00:11:22.324
<v Speaker 1>two could be an Auschwitz camp guard and</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps he would even derive some </v>

84
00:11:24.551 --> 00:11:26.470
<v Speaker 1>enjoyment out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might think not,</v>

85
00:11:26.471 --> 00:11:28.630
<v Speaker 1>but you shouldn't think not so quickly.</v>

86
00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:29.883
<v Speaker 1>And what that also implies is that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could see what that meant when you </v>

87
00:11:33.161 --> 00:11:34.780
<v Speaker 1>looked in the mirror and looked at </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

88
00:11:34.781 --> 00:11:35.614
<v Speaker 1>you might run away screaming because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd have a revelation of just exactly </v>

89
00:11:38.741 --> 00:11:42.430
<v Speaker 1>what the human being is capable of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very unpleasant revelation.</v>

90
00:11:42.431 --> 00:11:43.264
<v Speaker 1>And also one of the things that stops </v>
<v Speaker 1>people from being enlightened because </v>

91
00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:47.373
<v Speaker 1>that revelation of the evil of the self </v>
<v Speaker 1>is part of the journey to enlightenment </v>

92
00:11:50.801 --> 00:11:51.634
<v Speaker 1>and an early part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the shadow be all the parts of the </v>

93
00:11:54.311 --> 00:11:55.144
<v Speaker 1>personality that the persona rejects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that might be the aggressive </v>

94
00:11:58.631 --> 00:11:59.464
<v Speaker 1>elements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certainly the case that's the case with </v>

95
00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:05.920
<v Speaker 1>for people who are hyper agreeable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now you can tell,</v>

96
00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:06.963
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two pathways to the development </v>

97
00:12:09.011 --> 00:12:11.530
<v Speaker 1>of the shadow and they're tightly </v>
<v Speaker 1>aligned with one another.</v>

98
00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:12.963
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental pathway is truth and </v>

99
00:12:15.071 --> 00:12:17.440
<v Speaker 1>that's to face the bitter truth about </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

100
00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.600
<v Speaker 1>But to break that down more </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly,</v>

101
00:12:19.601 --> 00:12:24.010
<v Speaker 1>you might think about that as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity to observe your own resentment.</v>

102
00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:28.000
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be resentful and bitter </v>
<v Speaker 1>in many situations because you don't get</v>

103
00:12:28.001 --> 00:12:30.460
<v Speaker 1>what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you watch that resentment,</v>

104
00:12:30.461 --> 00:12:31.400
<v Speaker 1>bitterness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clc,</v>

105
00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:32.253
<v Speaker 1>that it produces fantasies that can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably dark and that can be very </v>

106
00:12:36.101 --> 00:12:36.934
<v Speaker 1>frightening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might not want to admit to </v>

107
00:12:38.081 --> 00:12:38.914
<v Speaker 1>yourself that you're actually capable of</v>
<v Speaker 1>having fantasies like that or impulses </v>

108
00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:45.400
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or aggressive feelings like that.</v>

109
00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:46.713
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is is that if those </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggressive feelings and impulses and </v>

110
00:12:50.051 --> 00:12:52.270
<v Speaker 1>fantasies are integrated into your </v>
<v Speaker 1>character,</v>

111
00:12:52.271 --> 00:12:55.660
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're opening up a dialogue </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a part of yourself that can be very</v>

112
00:12:55.661 --> 00:12:56.494
<v Speaker 1>forceful and strong and dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's really useful to be dangerous </v>

113
00:13:00.671 --> 00:13:04.150
<v Speaker 1>because if you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can be dangerous,</v>

114
00:13:04.151 --> 00:13:05.740
<v Speaker 1>you often don't have to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

115
00:13:05.741 --> 00:13:07.660
<v Speaker 1>it's often weak people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

116
00:13:07.661 --> 00:13:09.790
<v Speaker 1>it's weak men generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who rape,</v>

117
00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:11.313
<v Speaker 1>you know that that's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very common occurrence and that's a </v>

118
00:13:13.091 --> 00:13:15.250
<v Speaker 1>violent act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's born out of weakness,</v>

119
00:13:15.251 --> 00:13:16.990
<v Speaker 1>not out of strength,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

120
00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:21.040
<v Speaker 1>And so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you attend to your resentment honestly,</v>

121
00:13:21.041 --> 00:13:23.530
<v Speaker 1>and you observe yourself and what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually like.</v>

122
00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:24.543
<v Speaker 1>You got to pay attention as if you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know yourself as if you might harbor </v>

123
00:13:26.951 --> 00:13:29.440
<v Speaker 1>hidden devils and then maybe they'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>emerge.</v>

124
00:13:29.441 --> 00:13:30.274
<v Speaker 1>Now you'll also felt that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>embedded inside the shout at where the </v>

125
00:13:33.131 --> 00:13:35.680
<v Speaker 1>contras sexual tendencies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so for example,</v>

126
00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:39.490
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you see people who are well </v>
<v Speaker 1>developed men let's say.</v>

127
00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:40.413
<v Speaker 1>And we can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can also talk about women in this </v>

128
00:13:41.831 --> 00:13:44.890
<v Speaker 1>regard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men who've integrated their shadow often</v>

129
00:13:44.891 --> 00:13:45.724
<v Speaker 1>also develop a kind of peculiar grace </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be a consequence of not only </v>

130
00:13:49.481 --> 00:13:53.420
<v Speaker 1>allowing their aggressive side to step </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward but also their,</v>

131
00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:56.410
<v Speaker 1>their feminine and Compassionate side </v>
<v Speaker 1>that might,</v>

132
00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:57.333
<v Speaker 1>that they may have kept squelched </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of embarrassment about it or </v>

133
00:13:59.261 --> 00:14:02.200
<v Speaker 1>because they'd been harassed for being </v>
<v Speaker 1>weak or any number of things.</v>

134
00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:03.363
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the practical approach for </v>

135
00:14:04.241 --> 00:14:09.241
<v Speaker 1>developing your shadow I would say is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>contemplate and consider your resentment</v>

136
00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:10.683
<v Speaker 1>and notice what it says and cause your </v>
<v Speaker 1>resentment will also tell you what you </v>

137
00:14:13.451 --> 00:14:14.410
<v Speaker 1>have to say.</v>

138
00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:16.550
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at,</v>

139
00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.070
<v Speaker 1>look at what happened to Google this </v>
<v Speaker 1>weekend.</v>

140
00:14:18.071 --> 00:14:20.470
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>James Damore wrote that memo and you can</v>

141
00:14:20.471 --> 00:14:21.304
<v Speaker 1>imagine he was pretty angry and perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 1>even somewhat resentful at having to </v>

142
00:14:24.851 --> 00:14:25.684
<v Speaker 1>attend that diversity seminar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm really just using this as an </v>

143
00:14:27.581 --> 00:14:28.414
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what he did was decide that that </v>

144
00:14:31.661 --> 00:14:35.080
<v Speaker 1>meant that he had something that he had </v>
<v Speaker 1>to say and then look at the consequences</v>

145
00:14:35.081 --> 00:14:37.480
<v Speaker 1>of that man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an absolutely unbelievable.</v>

146
00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:38.613
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if your feet and pressed at work or </v>

147
00:14:40.211 --> 00:14:42.430
<v Speaker 1>you're oppressed in your life for or you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

148
00:14:42.431 --> 00:14:43.264
<v Speaker 1>or you're oppressing yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you got a notice that you're </v>

149
00:14:45.581 --> 00:14:46.414
<v Speaker 1>feeling oppressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have to notice that you're </v>

150
00:14:47.351 --> 00:14:50.890
<v Speaker 1>feeling resentful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>resentful and angry and bitter.</v>

151
00:14:50.891 --> 00:14:51.724
<v Speaker 1>And maybe even like Cain in the story of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cain Abel Cause Cain is sort of the </v>

152
00:14:54.771 --> 00:14:55.604
<v Speaker 1>architectural bitter man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to decide what it is </v>

153
00:14:57.981 --> 00:15:01.310
<v Speaker 1>that you need to do in order to remove </v>
<v Speaker 1>from yourself that bitterness.</v>

154
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:03.860
<v Speaker 1>And that's usually means that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that you have to say.</v>

155
00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.860
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to say it because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're sold depends on it.</v>

156
00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:08.810
<v Speaker 1>And not only does your soul depending on</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

157
00:15:08.811 --> 00:15:12.350
<v Speaker 1>I would say the fate of the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>depends on it because you know you might</v>

158
00:15:12.351 --> 00:15:14.860
<v Speaker 1>be wrong and then you should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>straightened out.</v>

159
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:17.570
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're just being whiny and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to talk to somebody about that.</v>

160
00:15:17.571 --> 00:15:20.630
<v Speaker 1>But it may be that you're actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>detecting something wrong,</v>

161
00:15:20.631 --> 00:15:21.464
<v Speaker 1>some tyranny that's directed towards you</v>
<v Speaker 1>and other people and it's like your </v>

162
00:15:24.231 --> 00:15:25.064
<v Speaker 1>moral obligation to speak up about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so many workplaces become toxic to </v>

163
00:15:28.851 --> 00:15:29.684
<v Speaker 1>use a terrible clash cliche because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the people in them won't speak up for </v>

164
00:15:32.991 --> 00:15:37.010
<v Speaker 1>what they actually want or they speak up</v>
<v Speaker 1>too late and then they're all twisted up</v>

165
00:15:37.011 --> 00:15:37.844
<v Speaker 1>about it and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know they're torturing other </v>

166
00:15:39.291 --> 00:15:41.990
<v Speaker 1>people because they're so unhappy and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>forth and so on.</v>

167
00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:43.153
<v Speaker 1>So practical approach for developing new</v>
<v Speaker 1>shout of fundamentally is radical </v>

168
00:15:46.911 --> 00:15:47.744
<v Speaker 1>honesty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Young said that I know a genuine </v>

169
00:15:50.061 --> 00:15:52.610
<v Speaker 1>moral effort was a good substitute for </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapy.</v>

170
00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:53.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

171
00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:55.870
<v Speaker 1>What is my opinion on open </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships,</v>

172
00:15:55.871 --> 00:15:58.720
<v Speaker 1>polyamory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other forms of non monogamy?</v>

173
00:15:59.050 --> 00:15:59.883
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that as a medium to longterm </v>

174
00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:03.063
<v Speaker 1>strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're completely untenable because </v>

175
00:16:05.441 --> 00:16:07.390
<v Speaker 1>human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as I'm concerned,</v>

176
00:16:07.391 --> 00:16:09.640
<v Speaker 1>are fundamentally pair bonding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

177
00:16:09.641 --> 00:16:12.730
<v Speaker 1>if you're just talking about casual sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

178
00:16:12.731 --> 00:16:15.070
<v Speaker 1>I think casual sex is a contradiction in</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms.</v>

179
00:16:15.071 --> 00:16:17.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's anything about sex</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's casual.</v>

180
00:16:17.141 --> 00:16:19.900
<v Speaker 1>And I think that people are deceiving </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves badly whenever they think.</v>

181
00:16:19.901 --> 00:16:22.020
<v Speaker 1>So they might like to live in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

182
00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:25.720
<v Speaker 1>1970s playboy adolescent fantasy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't,</v>

183
00:16:25.721 --> 00:16:28.900
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen that work under any </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances whatsoever.</v>

184
00:16:28.901 --> 00:16:29.734
<v Speaker 1>And I think people get hurt badly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also a bad medium to longterm </v>

185
00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:34.210
<v Speaker 1>strategy because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

186
00:16:34.211 --> 00:16:35.380
<v Speaker 1>pair bonding is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

187
00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:39.010
<v Speaker 1>is the most stable arrangement we know </v>
<v Speaker 1>of at least so far.</v>

188
00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:40.750
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't even put it that way.</v>

189
00:16:40.751 --> 00:16:42.440
<v Speaker 1>It's the only stable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

190
00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:45.610
<v Speaker 1>mode of being that we know for the long </v>
<v Speaker 1>run.</v>

191
00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:48.400
<v Speaker 1>And that's especially the case when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>bring children into the equation.</v>

192
00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:49.770
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

193
00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:53.980
<v Speaker 1>I think it's delusional fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that people who are,</v>

194
00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:56.200
<v Speaker 1>who believe that such things work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

195
00:16:56.201 --> 00:16:57.034
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they're open people in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>creative and their exploratory and all </v>

196
00:16:59.261 --> 00:17:00.094
<v Speaker 1>of that and fair enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but often they're just unconscientious </v>

197
00:17:01.961 --> 00:17:02.794
<v Speaker 1>and they don't want to take any </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility and they want to live in </v>

198
00:17:05.201 --> 00:17:08.560
<v Speaker 1>this wish fulfillment fantasy where </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody can have all the sex they want</v>

199
00:17:08.561 --> 00:17:09.394
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's always wonderful and no one </v>

200
00:17:10.841 --> 00:17:11.800
<v Speaker 1>gets hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

201
00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:12.663
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that just doesn't work in the real </v>

202
00:17:13.571 --> 00:17:14.950
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

203
00:17:16.830 --> 00:17:19.410
<v Speaker 1>my girlfriend is quite overweight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I really love her.</v>

204
00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:21.360
<v Speaker 1>Should I try to encourage her to lose </v>
<v Speaker 1>weight?</v>

205
00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:22.523
<v Speaker 1>Aside from personal preference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this likely to explode into a major </v>

206
00:17:24.991 --> 00:17:25.920
<v Speaker 1>issue down the road?</v>

207
00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:28.073
<v Speaker 2>Huh.</v>

208
00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:37.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that you can fool yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>about what you're attracted to and yes,</v>

209
00:17:37.481 --> 00:17:40.510
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly likely to develop into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>major issue down the road.</v>

210
00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:43.100
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's tough,</v>

211
00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:44.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

212
00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:46.700
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

213
00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.040
<v Speaker 2>the devil's in</v>

214
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:50.910
<v Speaker 1>the details,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

215
00:17:50.911 --> 00:17:52.980
<v Speaker 1>should you try to encourage her to lose </v>
<v Speaker 1>weight?</v>

216
00:17:52.981 --> 00:17:53.814
<v Speaker 1>I guess the question is how would you do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that without disrupting the </v>

217
00:17:56.311 --> 00:17:58.020
<v Speaker 1>relationship?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

218
00:17:58.760 --> 00:17:59.230
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

219
00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:01.570
<v Speaker 1>And without knowing more about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>details of that,</v>

220
00:18:01.571 --> 00:18:05.980
<v Speaker 1>I would say that I don't know how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell what to tell you to do about that.</v>

221
00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:11.080
<v Speaker 1>I think that it's necessary to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>truthful in a relationship period.</v>

222
00:18:11.081 --> 00:18:13.990
<v Speaker 1>But I also think that you can't use the </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth to hurt,</v>

223
00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:15.063
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth is a very complicated thing </v>

224
00:18:16.181 --> 00:18:17.014
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a sword and it cuts and you can't </v>

225
00:18:20.021 --> 00:18:22.000
<v Speaker 1>use it to hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

226
00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:22.863
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you would be subtle enough to </v>

227
00:18:23.891 --> 00:18:24.724
<v Speaker 1>figure out some way that you could both </v>
<v Speaker 1>embark on a health promoting endeavor </v>

228
00:18:28.921 --> 00:18:31.970
<v Speaker 1>together and that would work out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

229
00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:33.550
<v Speaker 1>but I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

230
00:18:33.551 --> 00:18:34.384
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're in under stable longterm </v>

231
00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:37.023
<v Speaker 1>relationship with someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty much necessary for both of </v>

232
00:18:40.451 --> 00:18:44.710
<v Speaker 1>you to address all the issues that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>making you unhappy with each other.</v>

233
00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:46.270
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

234
00:18:46.271 --> 00:18:47.104
<v Speaker 1>assuming there's some give and take on </v>
<v Speaker 1>that because otherwise the relationship </v>

235
00:18:50.591 --> 00:18:52.630
<v Speaker 1>can easily come apart at the seams.</v>

236
00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:55.870
<v Speaker 1>Like I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my wife and I are both very hard on each</v>

237
00:18:55.871 --> 00:18:58.840
<v Speaker 1>other about our physical appearance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

238
00:18:58.841 --> 00:18:59.674
<v Speaker 1>And I had gained a fair bit of weight </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the time I was say 40 until the </v>

239
00:19:02.801 --> 00:19:03.634
<v Speaker 1>time I was 50 about probably because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was eating things that weren't good for </v>

240
00:19:06.161 --> 00:19:06.994
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say that was primarily </v>

241
00:19:07.691 --> 00:19:08.524
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you if you want to lose </v>

242
00:19:09.881 --> 00:19:11.740
<v Speaker 1>weight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you stop eating carbohydrates,</v>

243
00:19:11.741 --> 00:19:12.640
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll lose weight.</v>

244
00:19:12.641 --> 00:19:14.260
<v Speaker 1>Like you wouldn't believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

245
00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:17.020
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't necessarily recommend it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it has some dangerous,</v>

246
00:19:17.021 --> 00:19:19.360
<v Speaker 1>but it certainly works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

247
00:19:19.361 --> 00:19:20.194
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the alternative to protect to the </v>

248
00:19:23.441 --> 00:19:25.540
<v Speaker 1>alternative is to pretend that </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's all right.</v>

249
00:19:25.541 --> 00:19:28.900
<v Speaker 1>And all that means is that you're likely</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get drunk sometimes some day and have</v>

250
00:19:28.901 --> 00:19:32.440
<v Speaker 1>an affair out of bitterness and spite in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that you're no longer attracted</v>

251
00:19:32.441 --> 00:19:33.070
<v Speaker 1>to your partner.</v>

252
00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:36.940
<v Speaker 1>So it's pretty rough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a pretty rough way of thinking</v>

253
00:19:36.941 --> 00:19:38.500
<v Speaker 1>about things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but life's pretty rough.</v>

254
00:19:38.501 --> 00:19:43.150
<v Speaker 1>So what is the story behind the logo </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you use in your intros?</v>

255
00:19:43.151 --> 00:19:45.740
<v Speaker 1>Where did it come from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

256
00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:48.580
<v Speaker 1>that logo is called the meaning of </v>
<v Speaker 1>music.</v>

257
00:19:48.581 --> 00:19:49.414
<v Speaker 1>And it's actually a sculpture that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>made in 1985 that's about s five and a </v>

258
00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:55.533
<v Speaker 1>half feet by half,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five and a half feet and about eight </v>

259
00:19:57.161 --> 00:19:59.470
<v Speaker 1>inches thick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's made out of foam core,</v>

260
00:19:59.471 --> 00:20:01.600
<v Speaker 1>which is this bay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a subset.</v>

261
00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:02.493
<v Speaker 1>It's a material that's often used as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>backing for paintings or for when you </v>

262
00:20:06.161 --> 00:20:06.994
<v Speaker 1>get them framed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's it's styrofoam sheet about a </v>

263
00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:10.473
<v Speaker 1>quarter of an inch thick with paper on </v>
<v Speaker 1>both sides and you can cut it very </v>

264
00:20:12.341 --> 00:20:13.174
<v Speaker 1>accurately with an exacto knife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what I did was make a stack of </v>

265
00:20:16.961 --> 00:20:17.850
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

266
00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:18.993
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those foam core sheets about 80 inches </v>

267
00:20:21.311 --> 00:20:25.630
<v Speaker 1>high and it made the thing in quarters </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that it would fit together on the</v>

268
00:20:25.631 --> 00:20:27.850
<v Speaker 1>wall because it would have been too big </v>
<v Speaker 1>to maneuver easily.</v>

269
00:20:27.851 --> 00:20:28.710
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

270
00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:29.913
<v Speaker 1>it's a very complicated image.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually a three dimensional </v>

271
00:20:35.141 --> 00:20:36.880
<v Speaker 1>representation of a,</v>

272
00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:44.970
<v Speaker 1>it's a three dimensional representation </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a two dimensional representation of a</v>

273
00:20:44.971 --> 00:20:49.000
<v Speaker 1>four dimensional object and that four </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensional object you could think of as</v>

274
00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:54.520
<v Speaker 1>it's a representation of time and space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I can tell you,</v>

275
00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:57.670
<v Speaker 1>I kind of have to hint at what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>painting means.</v>

276
00:20:57.671 --> 00:21:00.250
<v Speaker 1>It or the sculpture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means the same thing.</v>

277
00:21:00.251 --> 00:21:01.300
<v Speaker 1>That music means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

278
00:21:01.301 --> 00:21:05.050
<v Speaker 1>how music unfolds and then something </v>
<v Speaker 1>else unfolds within it.</v>

279
00:21:05.051 --> 00:21:08.140
<v Speaker 1>And then it unfolds again within it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a rose opening into the,</v>

280
00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:09.333
<v Speaker 1>into the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or like a lotus flower that sort of </v>

281
00:21:11.951 --> 00:21:12.784
<v Speaker 1>comes up from the darkest steps up </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the dark water and then blooms </v>

282
00:21:16.241 --> 00:21:19.030
<v Speaker 1>on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the surface of the water and the sun.</v>

283
00:21:19.031 --> 00:21:20.860
<v Speaker 1>And that's where the Buddha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

284
00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:22.060
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you say?</v>

285
00:21:22.061 --> 00:21:25.150
<v Speaker 1>Symbol symbolically rest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it can imagine that thing opening and</v>

286
00:21:25.151 --> 00:21:27.880
<v Speaker 1>then imagine that that's what that </v>
<v Speaker 1>painting is an image of.</v>

287
00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:31.180
<v Speaker 1>And that's the same thing as music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a Mandela image.</v>

288
00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:34.450
<v Speaker 1>And for young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Mandela was a symbol of the self and</v>

289
00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:37.090
<v Speaker 1>the self was something that unfolds like</v>
<v Speaker 1>music,</v>

290
00:21:37.091 --> 00:21:40.060
<v Speaker 1>which is actually why we like music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like the,</v>

291
00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:43.150
<v Speaker 1>the rose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rose that you see,</v>

292
00:21:43.151 --> 00:21:43.791
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

293
00:21:43.791 --> 00:21:46.210
<v Speaker 1>the geometric rose that you see in stain</v>
<v Speaker 1>glass.</v>

294
00:21:46.211 --> 00:21:47.640
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

295
00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:51.670
<v Speaker 1>that's the Stain Glass Window that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio's reprehensible,</v>

296
00:21:51.671 --> 00:21:52.710
<v Speaker 1>compatriot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

297
00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:53.820
<v Speaker 1>what's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lamp.</v>

298
00:21:53.821 --> 00:21:54.654
<v Speaker 1>Wick breaks when he's in pleasure island</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he throws it rock to destroy the </v>

299
00:21:57.521 --> 00:22:01.740
<v Speaker 1>model home and to demolish the </v>
<v Speaker 1>substructure of Western civilization.</v>

300
00:22:01.741 --> 00:22:02.574
<v Speaker 1>And so I had a very intense religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience at one point when I was </v>

301
00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:10.390
<v Speaker 1>contemplating that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when I drew the image to begin with,</v>

302
00:22:10.391 --> 00:22:12.400
<v Speaker 1>I drew it in about 10 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of rough.</v>

303
00:22:12.401 --> 00:22:13.234
<v Speaker 1>And then I used a straight edge to </v>
<v Speaker 1>straighten it all open and a protractor </v>

304
00:22:16.391 --> 00:22:18.550
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a compass to make the curves.</v>

305
00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:20.800
<v Speaker 1>But I drew it very quickly and I'd been </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about,</v>

306
00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:22.930
<v Speaker 1>I've been reading young a lot at that </v>
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>

307
00:22:22.931 --> 00:22:24.160
<v Speaker 1>like for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for months,</v>

308
00:22:24.161 --> 00:22:24.994
<v Speaker 1>months of intense reading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that image sort of popped out of me </v>

309
00:22:28.211 --> 00:22:29.160
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

310
00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:30.033
<v Speaker 1>very suddenly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it took about three months to make </v>

311
00:22:31.631 --> 00:22:32.464
<v Speaker 1>the actual image.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I had only a quarter of it </v>

312
00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:37.090
<v Speaker 1>hanging on my wall because it was so </v>
<v Speaker 1>big.</v>

313
00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:39.870
<v Speaker 1>And I had finished it after about three </v>
<v Speaker 1>months of work.</v>

314
00:22:39.871 --> 00:22:40.704
<v Speaker 1>So this was back in 1985 when I was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>graduate student and I was listening to </v>

315
00:22:43.601 --> 00:22:46.510
<v Speaker 1>the Jupiter symphony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the piece of music that I use,</v>

316
00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:49.180
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was used for the intro to my,</v>

317
00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:51.700
<v Speaker 1>to my videos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a Mozart symphony.</v>

318
00:22:51.701 --> 00:22:53.250
<v Speaker 1>And this happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

319
00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:56.710
<v Speaker 1>So this happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was really watching that,</v>

320
00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:59.140
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mandela that quarter,</v>

321
00:22:59.141 --> 00:22:59.974
<v Speaker 1>Mandela,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I had made intensely and caught </v>

322
00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:02.753
<v Speaker 1>listening to the music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to understand what the music </v>

323
00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:06.250
<v Speaker 1>music was signifying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

324
00:23:06.251 --> 00:23:09.850
<v Speaker 1>because music has intrinsic meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a very strange thing.</v>

325
00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:10.683
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the part of the reason for that is that </v>

326
00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:16.720
<v Speaker 1>language has meaning and our language </v>
<v Speaker 1>has a musical quality,</v>

327
00:23:16.721 --> 00:23:17.554
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's process mostly by the right </v>

328
00:23:18.791 --> 00:23:20.380
<v Speaker 1>hemisphere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that when people speak,</v>

329
00:23:20.381 --> 00:23:21.214
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a melody in their language and </v>

330
00:23:23.561 --> 00:23:25.600
<v Speaker 1>that carries a lot of the emotional </v>
<v Speaker 1>import.</v>

331
00:23:25.601 --> 00:23:28.720
<v Speaker 1>And then what musicians have done is </v>
<v Speaker 1>figured out how to use that,</v>

332
00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:29.723
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

333
00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:32.830
<v Speaker 1>that musical faculty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's call it that,</v>

334
00:23:32.831 --> 00:23:37.831
<v Speaker 1>no one semantic musical faculty to sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of purely denote meaning.</v>

335
00:23:37.871 --> 00:23:40.240
<v Speaker 1>That's part of what music means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

336
00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:43.060
<v Speaker 1>but I was still trying to understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>what the meaning was.</v>

337
00:23:43.061 --> 00:23:43.894
<v Speaker 1>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's the meaning of music and I </v>

338
00:23:47.061 --> 00:23:48.680
<v Speaker 1>was trying to figure out how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>articulate that.</v>

339
00:23:48.681 --> 00:23:49.514
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly why I made the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sculpture was to get a grip on it </v>

340
00:23:53.091 --> 00:23:56.690
<v Speaker 1>and to understand it in anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was really,</v>

341
00:23:56.691 --> 00:23:58.070
<v Speaker 1>really concentrating hard on that.</v>

342
00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:58.903
<v Speaker 1>Mandela and that sculpture and I had </v>
<v Speaker 1>been working on it intensely for about </v>

343
00:24:02.601 --> 00:24:03.381
<v Speaker 1>three months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

344
00:24:03.381 --> 00:24:06.020
<v Speaker 1>so that's a lot of meditation on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>single idea.</v>

345
00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:10.490
<v Speaker 1>And I was standing in my living room and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I had this very strange experience.</v>

346
00:24:10.491 --> 00:24:11.324
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

347
00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:12.303
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't explain this properly because </v>

348
00:24:13.671 --> 00:24:16.400
<v Speaker 1>there's no way of really describing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll do my best.</v>

349
00:24:16.401 --> 00:24:17.234
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when those renaissance painting </v>

350
00:24:18.511 --> 00:24:20.570
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well first of all,</v>

351
00:24:20.571 --> 00:24:23.240
<v Speaker 1>you see great cloud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>

352
00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:27.430
<v Speaker 1>great sunny skies with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with massive what?</v>

353
00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:29.023
<v Speaker 1>Stupendous impressive bills of clouds </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then light shining through the </v>

354
00:24:32.331 --> 00:24:33.164
<v Speaker 1>sunlight shining through in streams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes that's captured very </v>

355
00:24:35.421 --> 00:24:40.340
<v Speaker 1>beautifully by especially English later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>later artists usually that or later than</v>

356
00:24:40.341 --> 00:24:41.174
<v Speaker 1>the renaissance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you see it renaissance paintings </v>

357
00:24:42.321 --> 00:24:43.730
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you all,</v>

358
00:24:43.731 --> 00:24:45.770
<v Speaker 1>you also see it in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

359
00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:46.783
<v Speaker 1>in renaissance paintings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the earlier phase of the </v>

360
00:24:48.741 --> 00:24:49.574
<v Speaker 1>renaissance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sky opening up in God sort of </v>

361
00:24:51.261 --> 00:24:52.610
<v Speaker 1>peering for through the clouds.</v>

362
00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:56.030
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly what seemed to happen</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me is that I had this sense,</v>

363
00:24:56.031 --> 00:24:56.864
<v Speaker 1>it was like a vision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I was still in my living room </v>

364
00:24:58.731 --> 00:25:00.720
<v Speaker 1>in Nuuk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but inside the theater of,</v>

365
00:25:00.721 --> 00:25:03.200
<v Speaker 1>of my imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could feel the,</v>

366
00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:06.170
<v Speaker 1>the sky opening up now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't the sky,</v>

367
00:25:06.171 --> 00:25:07.004
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say the only way I can really </v>

368
00:25:09.441 --> 00:25:10.274
<v Speaker 1>think about it is that with was </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like another dimension and </v>

369
00:25:13.161 --> 00:25:16.070
<v Speaker 1>then I can feel this force descend upon </v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

370
00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:18.530
<v Speaker 1>which I think was something that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

371
00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:23.510
<v Speaker 1>would have been considered classically </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like the holy ghost I suppose.</v>

372
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:26.720
<v Speaker 1>And it filled me with this intense sense</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

373
00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:27.590
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

374
00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:29.570
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Paradise.</v>

375
00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:35.360
<v Speaker 1>A Paradise Ul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

376
00:25:35.731 --> 00:25:36.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to say it though.</v>

377
00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:38.343
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

378
00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:42.080
<v Speaker 1>While it was like being in heaven for </v>
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

379
00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:42.943
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some brief period of time and I could </v>

380
00:25:44.991 --> 00:25:45.824
<v Speaker 1>feel myself transformed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>transmuted as a consequence of this </v>

381
00:25:48.351 --> 00:25:49.184
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

382
00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:53.150
<v Speaker 1>and it was as if I was in the presence </v>
<v Speaker 1>of something that was living,</v>

383
00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:54.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

384
00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:57.800
<v Speaker 1>I suppose that was an experience of God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to put it that way.</v>

385
00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:00.590
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's certainly what it seemed like an,</v>

386
00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:01.443
<v Speaker 1>and I felt that I could live that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could live transfigured like that </v>

387
00:26:04.311 --> 00:26:06.740
<v Speaker 1>permanently if I desired it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

388
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:07.783
<v Speaker 1>my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be able to walk down the </v>

389
00:26:08.481 --> 00:26:11.480
<v Speaker 1>street in this sort of elevated state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

390
00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:12.813
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how I would act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how he would interact with </v>

391
00:26:14.721 --> 00:26:15.554
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how people would interact </v>

392
00:26:16.281 --> 00:26:18.410
<v Speaker 1>with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't think that I could do it.</v>

393
00:26:18.411 --> 00:26:21.560
<v Speaker 1>And then I felt that whatever had </v>
<v Speaker 1>descended,</v>

394
00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:24.410
<v Speaker 1>it seemed that as if it was soro full in</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and it,</v>

395
00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:28.310
<v Speaker 1>and it departed from me slowly and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with no,</v>

396
00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:30.830
<v Speaker 1>like with no punitive intent.</v>

397
00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:31.663
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I wouldn't say with any </v>

398
00:26:32.481 --> 00:26:33.314
<v Speaker 1>dissatisfaction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was as if the gift had been offered </v>

399
00:26:35.301 --> 00:26:38.300
<v Speaker 1>that I wasn't in no position to receive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

400
00:26:38.301 --> 00:26:39.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went,</v>

401
00:26:39.770 --> 00:26:40.603
<v Speaker 1>I talked to my wife soon afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shook for about physically for about </v>

402
00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:45.290
<v Speaker 1>half an hour after that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

403
00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:47.610
<v Speaker 1>experience like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I was shaking,</v>

404
00:26:47.611 --> 00:26:48.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

405
00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:48.983
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you shake after a car accident if </v>

406
00:26:50.431 --> 00:26:51.264
<v Speaker 1>you've ever been in a car accident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my pupils were completely dilated </v>

407
00:26:53.941 --> 00:26:56.370
<v Speaker 1>and I had a couple of experiences like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

408
00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:58.770
<v Speaker 1>like echoes of it a couple of times </v>
<v Speaker 1>after that.</v>

409
00:26:58.771 --> 00:27:00.330
<v Speaker 1>And so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a very,</v>

410
00:27:00.331 --> 00:27:02.940
<v Speaker 1>very powerful experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've certainly never forgotten that.</v>

411
00:27:02.941 --> 00:27:04.830
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

412
00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:06.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno why,</v>

413
00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:08.040
<v Speaker 1>I dunno what to think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

414
00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:11.190
<v Speaker 1>God only knows what the world is really </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

415
00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:12.053
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've had a variety of very strange </v>

416
00:27:13.381 --> 00:27:16.500
<v Speaker 1>experiences that have convinced me that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we know very little about anything.</v>

417
00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:18.000
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

418
00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:21.600
<v Speaker 1>for those who are very creative but high</v>
<v Speaker 1>in neuroticism,</v>

419
00:27:21.601 --> 00:27:22.434
<v Speaker 1>how should one work to gain emotional </v>
<v Speaker 1>stability in order to go out into chaos </v>

420
00:27:25.261 --> 00:27:27.720
<v Speaker 1>to do more creative things?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a really good question.</v>

421
00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:28.853
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned about that by reading Ewing's </v>

422
00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:32.850
<v Speaker 1>works on El Camino,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weirdly enough.</v>

423
00:27:32.851 --> 00:27:35.820
<v Speaker 1>And so back again in graduate school </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was writing,</v>

424
00:27:35.821 --> 00:27:36.654
<v Speaker 1>starting to write maps and meaning and </v>
<v Speaker 1>really tearing myself apart </v>

425
00:27:38.491 --> 00:27:42.180
<v Speaker 1>psychologically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to understand evil,</v>

426
00:27:42.181 --> 00:27:43.014
<v Speaker 1>I suppose the evil of the Cold War and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the evil of the individuals who compose </v>

427
00:27:45.991 --> 00:27:47.880
<v Speaker 1>Nazi Germany and Stella,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this Russia.</v>

428
00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:50.280
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

429
00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:52.410
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was reading Carl Jung because he,</v>

430
00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:53.273
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wrote his tracks on alchemy where a </v>

431
00:27:55.321 --> 00:27:57.690
<v Speaker 1>lot about self transformation and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about,</v>

432
00:27:58.150 --> 00:27:58.983
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to explain his works on </v>

433
00:28:00.421 --> 00:28:01.254
<v Speaker 1>Alchemy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but suffice it to say that his advice </v>

434
00:28:03.991 --> 00:28:06.450
<v Speaker 1>was something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the advice he derived from the alchemist</v>

435
00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:07.523
<v Speaker 1>was that if you are going to make mess </v>
<v Speaker 1>around with very complicated and </v>

436
00:28:09.961 --> 00:28:12.810
<v Speaker 1>dangerous matters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good way of putting it.</v>

437
00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:15.240
<v Speaker 1>That you should really put your life </v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

438
00:28:15.241 --> 00:28:16.074
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say the right way to deal</v>
<v Speaker 1>with your neuroticism is to increase </v>

439
00:28:19.081 --> 00:28:19.914
<v Speaker 1>your conscientiousness because we also </v>
<v Speaker 1>know that the higher your </v>

440
00:28:22.381 --> 00:28:23.214
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lower year neuroticism </v>

441
00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:27.150
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness does seem to keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism and check.</v>

442
00:28:27.151 --> 00:28:29.730
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and have said this to many people,</v>

443
00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:31.890
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clean your room,</v>

444
00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:36.150
<v Speaker 1>organize your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like get a routine,</v>

445
00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:39.060
<v Speaker 1>get up every day at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go to bed at the same time.</v>

446
00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:44.240
<v Speaker 1>Established disciplined habits and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>will help a lot schedule like,</v>

447
00:28:44.251 --> 00:28:46.080
<v Speaker 1>and here's how to use a schedule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Use it.</v>

448
00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:47.970
<v Speaker 1>Use a calendar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I use Google calendar,</v>

449
00:28:47.971 --> 00:28:50.160
<v Speaker 1>but don't use it as a tyrant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

450
00:28:50.170 --> 00:28:53.070
<v Speaker 1>you want to use your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>use a calendar as if it's your,</v>

451
00:28:53.071 --> 00:28:56.550
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your confidant and advisor.</v>

452
00:28:56.850 --> 00:28:58.860
<v Speaker 1>And what you want to do is use the </v>
<v Speaker 1>calendar,</v>

453
00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:01.020
<v Speaker 1>sit down and open the calendar and </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

454
00:29:01.021 --> 00:29:02.430
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well here's what I'm going to do.</v>

455
00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:07.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to design a week of days that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I would really like to have.</v>

456
00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:09.143
<v Speaker 1>So what that would mean is that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>would schedule things that you would </v>

457
00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:14.540
<v Speaker 1>consider meaningful and productive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

458
00:29:15.030 --> 00:29:15.863
<v Speaker 1>on a daily basis so that you feel that </v>
<v Speaker 1>your life is justified by having a day </v>

459
00:29:20.461 --> 00:29:21.294
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also to schedule enough of your </v>

460
00:29:23.581 --> 00:29:24.414
<v Speaker 1>responsibilities so that you make </v>
<v Speaker 1>progress day by day instead of falling </v>

461
00:29:27.061 --> 00:29:27.894
<v Speaker 1>farther behind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what that'll do is it doesn't </v>

462
00:29:30.421 --> 00:29:33.600
<v Speaker 1>directly affect your neurophysiology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

463
00:29:33.601 --> 00:29:34.434
<v Speaker 1>you're reacting as a neurotic person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a person high in neuroticism say you </v>

464
00:29:37.741 --> 00:29:42.220
<v Speaker 1>react to uncertainty and the unexpected </v>
<v Speaker 1>with more physiological preparedness and</v>

465
00:29:42.221 --> 00:29:45.130
<v Speaker 1>more expenditure of energy than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>typical person.</v>

466
00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:46.233
<v Speaker 1>And so what you want to do is organize </v>
<v Speaker 1>your surroundings because it's a lot </v>

467
00:29:49.211 --> 00:29:50.044
<v Speaker 1>easier to organize your surroundings at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least to begin with than it is to do </v>

468
00:29:52.871 --> 00:29:55.450
<v Speaker 1>radical reconstruction on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental temperament,</v>

469
00:29:55.451 --> 00:29:57.070
<v Speaker 1>which you might not be able to do at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

470
00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:00.820
<v Speaker 1>So I would say discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>discipline.</v>

471
00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:03.820
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing I would say for </v>
<v Speaker 1>creative people,</v>

472
00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:04.713
<v Speaker 1>and this is true for people in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's really important for creative </v>

473
00:30:06.911 --> 00:30:09.520
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that if you want to be creative,</v>

474
00:30:09.521 --> 00:30:11.410
<v Speaker 1>which is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very dangerous and very,</v>

475
00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:12.303
<v Speaker 1>very unlikely to succeed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although absolutely necessary if you </v>

476
00:30:16.031 --> 00:30:16.864
<v Speaker 1>happened to be high in openness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you should organize the rest of </v>

477
00:30:19.391 --> 00:30:20.224
<v Speaker 1>your life except for your creative </v>
<v Speaker 1>endeavors in a pretty traditional and </v>

478
00:30:23.771 --> 00:30:25.840
<v Speaker 1>conservative manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can do that,</v>

479
00:30:25.841 --> 00:30:30.280
<v Speaker 1>because what that does is buttress you </v>
<v Speaker 1>against the unexpected and give you some</v>

480
00:30:30.281 --> 00:30:32.020
<v Speaker 1>stability on many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

481
00:30:32.021 --> 00:30:34.510
<v Speaker 1>along many of the potential dimensions </v>
<v Speaker 1>of your life.</v>

482
00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:38.200
<v Speaker 1>And that frees you up to take larger </v>
<v Speaker 1>risks in the creative domain.</v>

483
00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:39.453
<v Speaker 1>Now it's hard for creative people to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that because they're sort of blasting </v>

484
00:30:41.531 --> 00:30:42.341
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

485
00:30:42.341 --> 00:30:44.500
<v Speaker 1>laterally in all directions </v>
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously.</v>

486
00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:49.000
<v Speaker 1>But you exhaust yourself that way and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you also risk scattering yourself.</v>

487
00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:51.400
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Louie waterson here at,</v>

488
00:30:51.401 --> 00:30:52.234
<v Speaker 1>at a question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would you suggest someone who's a </v>

489
00:30:53.531 --> 00:30:57.370
<v Speaker 1>jack of all trades and master of none </v>
<v Speaker 1>conduct themselves while you're probably</v>

490
00:30:57.371 --> 00:30:59.170
<v Speaker 1>high in openness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high in creativity.</v>

491
00:30:59.171 --> 00:31:01.600
<v Speaker 1>And one of the dangers of being high and</v>
<v Speaker 1>creativity,</v>

492
00:31:01.601 --> 00:31:03.460
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're also high in </v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism,</v>

493
00:31:03.461 --> 00:31:04.294
<v Speaker 1>is that it's hard for creative people to</v>
<v Speaker 1>catalyze an identity because they're </v>

494
00:31:07.361 --> 00:31:09.610
<v Speaker 1>basically pan like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

495
00:31:09.611 --> 00:31:12.010
<v Speaker 1>like Peter Pan or like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or like Pan,</v>

496
00:31:12.011 --> 00:31:12.844
<v Speaker 1>which means everything that God of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>forest is the god of everything to some </v>

497
00:31:15.611 --> 00:31:17.710
<v Speaker 1>degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the problem with being everything is</v>

498
00:31:17.711 --> 00:31:20.890
<v Speaker 1>that you're also nothing at the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>time because you never specialized.</v>

499
00:31:20.891 --> 00:31:25.720
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say that if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that being a jack of all trades,</v>

500
00:31:25.721 --> 00:31:26.554
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty damn useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I would also say that it's really </v>

501
00:31:28.871 --> 00:31:29.704
<v Speaker 1>necessary to buckle down and find one </v>
<v Speaker 1>primary motive discipline and Jack or </v>

502
00:31:34.751 --> 00:31:35.080
<v Speaker 1>Louie.</v>

503
00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:37.960
<v Speaker 1>If you can't figure out what you should </v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

504
00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:38.913
<v Speaker 1>then guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just pick something that you think that </v>

505
00:31:41.681 --> 00:31:44.800
<v Speaker 1>you could hit hard and concentrate on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to be perfect at it.</v>

506
00:31:44.801 --> 00:31:45.634
<v Speaker 1>You don't even have to get it right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but pick something rather than nothing </v>

507
00:31:48.521 --> 00:31:50.950
<v Speaker 1>or pick something rather than all </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

508
00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:55.030
<v Speaker 1>And then set yourself to master that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

509
00:31:55.630 --> 00:31:57.300
<v Speaker 1>you need to have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

510
00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:58.180
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

511
00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:00.190
<v Speaker 1>discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a primary discipline.</v>

512
00:32:00.191 --> 00:32:02.290
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely necessary to succeed in </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

513
00:32:02.291 --> 00:32:04.180
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you have a primary discipline,</v>

514
00:32:04.181 --> 00:32:05.014
<v Speaker 1>then you can branch out and become a </v>
<v Speaker 1>multiplicity in your disciplined </v>

515
00:32:08.351 --> 00:32:09.184
<v Speaker 1>approach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you're absolutely bloody </v>

516
00:32:10.331 --> 00:32:11.164
<v Speaker 1>unstoppable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you really need that initial </v>

517
00:32:12.701 --> 00:32:14.680
<v Speaker 1>disciplinary routine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

518
00:32:14.681 --> 00:32:17.580
<v Speaker 1>this is something neat you knew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knew very well.</v>

519
00:32:18.130 --> 00:32:19.240
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

520
00:32:19.241 --> 00:32:21.250
<v Speaker 1>I just wrote about this today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that um,</v>

521
00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:23.313
<v Speaker 1>it was the long unfreedom of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Europe subjugation to the dogmatic </v>

522
00:32:27.551 --> 00:32:28.384
<v Speaker 1>structures of the Catholic Church that </v>
<v Speaker 1>in noble the European mind and gave it </v>

523
00:32:31.871 --> 00:32:36.340
<v Speaker 1>the capacity to widely range that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually developed.</v>

524
00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:37.173
<v Speaker 1>But it was that initial subjugation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that initial voluntary slavery that </v>

525
00:32:40.551 --> 00:32:41.384
<v Speaker 1>produced the discipline that produced </v>
<v Speaker 1>the spirit that can then go out and do </v>

526
00:32:45.561 --> 00:32:47.240
<v Speaker 1>other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's really,</v>

527
00:32:47.241 --> 00:32:50.900
<v Speaker 1>really useful to subjugate yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>something to something voluntarily.</v>

528
00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:53.180
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's partly why it's useful to</v>

529
00:32:53.181 --> 00:32:54.014
<v Speaker 1>practice a religious faith because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>subject yourself to a disciplinary </v>

530
00:32:58.161 --> 00:33:00.020
<v Speaker 1>structure that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might think,</v>

531
00:33:00.021 --> 00:33:01.700
<v Speaker 1>well that's all oppressive and all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

532
00:33:01.701 --> 00:33:05.210
<v Speaker 1>And of course that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also makes you disciplined.</v>

533
00:33:05.211 --> 00:33:06.740
<v Speaker 1>And once you're disciplined,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're,</v>

534
00:33:06.741 --> 00:33:07.574
<v Speaker 1>you're like a sharpened sword man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like well tempered blade and then you </v>

535
00:33:10.731 --> 00:33:12.500
<v Speaker 1>can go out there and operate in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

536
00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:14.510
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you haven't found your passion,</v>

537
00:33:14.511 --> 00:33:16.790
<v Speaker 1>then I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well don't wait around till you find the</v>

538
00:33:16.791 --> 00:33:20.990
<v Speaker 1>damn thing because you may never find it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is pick something and focus on it,</v>

539
00:33:20.991 --> 00:33:21.260
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

540
00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:22.093
<v Speaker 1>And if you move strongly and </v>
<v Speaker 1>forthrightly towards it for a number of </v>

541
00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:27.710
<v Speaker 1>months at least,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or even a number of years,</v>

542
00:33:27.711 --> 00:33:30.350
<v Speaker 1>and then you find,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that wasn't the thing for you,</v>

543
00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:31.393
<v Speaker 1>it isn't going to be a waste anyways </v>
<v Speaker 1>because most of the time the pursuit of </v>

544
00:33:34.431 --> 00:33:35.264
<v Speaker 1>any discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge pays off even if it doesn't </v>

545
00:33:37.311 --> 00:33:39.890
<v Speaker 1>pay off in the way that you initially </v>
<v Speaker 1>expect.</v>

546
00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:41.053
<v Speaker 1>So Alex Burnstein said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the female equivalent of the </v>

547
00:33:44.631 --> 00:33:46.070
<v Speaker 1>hero archetype?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmm,</v>

548
00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:48.510
<v Speaker 1>that's a great question man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

549
00:33:48.810 --> 00:33:52.580
<v Speaker 1>I spent a lot of time thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this and of course the women in my class</v>

550
00:33:52.581 --> 00:33:55.970
<v Speaker 1>and perhaps some of the women online to </v>
<v Speaker 1>are irritated or,</v>

551
00:33:56.090 --> 00:33:56.923
<v Speaker 1>or put off or maybe just alienated and </v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps properly sold by the fact that </v>

552
00:34:00.891 --> 00:34:04.970
<v Speaker 1>the archetypal hero is masculine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there's complex reasons for that and</v>

553
00:34:04.971 --> 00:34:05.804
<v Speaker 1>I would recommend for those who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually interested in such things to </v>

554
00:34:08.871 --> 00:34:09.704
<v Speaker 1>read Eric Noi Amens the origins and </v>
<v Speaker 1>history of consciousness and also the </v>

555
00:34:13.491 --> 00:34:14.324
<v Speaker 1>great mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are two great works of union </v>

556
00:34:15.741 --> 00:34:16.574
<v Speaker 1>psychology.</v>

557
00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:17.750
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Camille Paglia,</v>

558
00:34:17.751 --> 00:34:20.240
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a big fan of both of those books.</v>

559
00:34:20.390 --> 00:34:21.223
<v Speaker 1>For those of you who might be interested</v>
<v Speaker 1>because Norman does the best job that I </v>

560
00:34:24.411 --> 00:34:25.244
<v Speaker 1>know of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of describing why the symbolism of the </v>

561
00:34:28.941 --> 00:34:31.130
<v Speaker 1>hero is laid out the way it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why Mother Nature,</v>

562
00:34:31.131 --> 00:34:34.220
<v Speaker 1>his mother feminine and why the hero is </v>
<v Speaker 1>masculine now,</v>

563
00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:35.143
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But here's how I've come to understand </v>

564
00:34:36.771 --> 00:34:39.700
<v Speaker 1>it and I'm going to use Christian </v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolic language because I uh,</v>

565
00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:41.990
<v Speaker 1>because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the quickest,</v>

566
00:34:41.991 --> 00:34:44.180
<v Speaker 1>it's the shortest route to this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>explanation.</v>

567
00:34:44.181 --> 00:34:47.840
<v Speaker 1>So I would say that in the male psyche,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Dragon,</v>

568
00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:50.540
<v Speaker 1>the dragon slaying hero is at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>forefront.</v>

569
00:34:50.541 --> 00:34:52.760
<v Speaker 1>And so that would be Christ in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>architectural mode.</v>

570
00:34:52.761 --> 00:34:53.594
<v Speaker 1>Because this dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he defeats is the evil that that is </v>

571
00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:59.240
<v Speaker 1>encompassed in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in within the figure of Satan.</v>

572
00:34:59.241 --> 00:35:03.320
<v Speaker 1>So that'd be like the ultimate dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then behind that is the feminine,</v>

573
00:35:03.350 --> 00:35:04.970
<v Speaker 1>that compassionate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the caring.</v>

574
00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:07.880
<v Speaker 1>And that would be embodied say in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christian figure of Mary.</v>

575
00:35:07.881 --> 00:35:11.420
<v Speaker 1>So you have an in both male,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the male and female soul,</v>

576
00:35:11.421 --> 00:35:13.700
<v Speaker 1>let's say you have Christ and Mary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the mail,</v>

577
00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:15.680
<v Speaker 1>Christ is foremost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>foremost,</v>

578
00:35:15.681 --> 00:35:17.420
<v Speaker 1>that's the dragon slayer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll say.</v>

579
00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:18.673
<v Speaker 1>And Mary is the secondary character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And although both should be very well </v>

580
00:35:22.251 --> 00:35:23.270
<v Speaker 1>developed and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

581
00:35:23.271 --> 00:35:24.104
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that means that makes for a much </v>

582
00:35:25.251 --> 00:35:26.900
<v Speaker 1>better character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in the female,</v>

583
00:35:26.901 --> 00:35:30.920
<v Speaker 1>it's the other way around is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>maternal slash feminine.</v>

584
00:35:30.921 --> 00:35:35.921
<v Speaker 1>So let's say Mary is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is at the forefront and Christ is in the</v>

585
00:35:35.961 --> 00:35:37.100
<v Speaker 1>background,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dragon slayers,</v>

586
00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:38.940
<v Speaker 1>the background,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but should be well developed.</v>

587
00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:41.280
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>young felt that,</v>

588
00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:42.233
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was possible for men to develop the </v>

589
00:35:43.561 --> 00:35:46.950
<v Speaker 1>more feminine side of themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the last half of life,</v>

590
00:35:46.951 --> 00:35:47.784
<v Speaker 1>which is also when he felt that women </v>
<v Speaker 1>should develop the more masculine side </v>

591
00:35:50.011 --> 00:35:50.550
<v Speaker 1>of themselves.</v>

592
00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:51.570
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can,</v>

593
00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:52.853
<v Speaker 1>could debate that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a perfectly reasonable </v>

594
00:35:53.911 --> 00:35:54.744
<v Speaker 1>proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we should note that the figure of </v>

595
00:35:56.611 --> 00:35:57.890
<v Speaker 1>Mary is actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

596
00:35:58.020 --> 00:35:59.370
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is actually,</v>

597
00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:02.970
<v Speaker 1>what would you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a heroic figure in and of itself,</v>

598
00:36:02.971 --> 00:36:05.250
<v Speaker 1>because like you can really understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

599
00:36:05.251 --> 00:36:08.220
<v Speaker 1>If you look at Michelangelo's Pieta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in that great sculpture,</v>

600
00:36:08.221 --> 00:36:12.300
<v Speaker 1>you see Mary Who's holding the crucified</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ and that's basically her son,</v>

601
00:36:12.301 --> 00:36:12.970
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her,</v>

602
00:36:12.970 --> 00:36:14.370
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her son,</v>

603
00:36:14.371 --> 00:36:15.204
<v Speaker 1>who's just being offered up to the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>and betrayed by his friends and broken </v>

604
00:36:17.791 --> 00:36:19.590
<v Speaker 1>on the cross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

605
00:36:19.591 --> 00:36:22.260
<v Speaker 1>he's being subject to the worst that </v>
<v Speaker 1>life can throw at him.</v>

606
00:36:22.261 --> 00:36:23.094
<v Speaker 1>And the thing about Mary is that she </v>
<v Speaker 1>knew initially when she agreed to give </v>

607
00:36:27.661 --> 00:36:30.450
<v Speaker 1>birth to the savior of mankind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he would be broken.</v>

608
00:36:30.451 --> 00:36:34.680
<v Speaker 1>And that's an archetypal story because </v>
<v Speaker 1>women know in their heart of hearts that</v>

609
00:36:34.681 --> 00:36:37.860
<v Speaker 1>their children are going to be broken </v>
<v Speaker 1>and killed by the world.</v>

610
00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:40.770
<v Speaker 1>That that's the human condition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a car.</v>

611
00:36:40.771 --> 00:36:44.070
<v Speaker 1>And of course a woman who's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a woman who's well developed,</v>

612
00:36:44.071 --> 00:36:47.160
<v Speaker 1>loves her child more than herself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>loves her job more than anyone else,</v>

613
00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:49.860
<v Speaker 1>which is something you can't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand until you've had a child.</v>

614
00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:51.173
<v Speaker 1>But he's still willing to bring that </v>
<v Speaker 1>child into the world knowing full well </v>

615
00:36:54.331 --> 00:36:57.870
<v Speaker 1>what his or her fate will be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a real heroism and APP.</v>

616
00:36:58.500 --> 00:36:59.333
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's the standard here </v>

617
00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:04.140
<v Speaker 1>wisdom that a woman can undertake where </v>
<v Speaker 1>she develops her masculine side,</v>

618
00:37:04.141 --> 00:37:06.000
<v Speaker 1>which is basically what happens for </v>
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>

619
00:37:06.001 --> 00:37:06.990
<v Speaker 1>in sleeping beauty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

620
00:37:07.410 --> 00:37:08.243
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when sleeping beauty is awakened by the </v>

621
00:37:09.421 --> 00:37:11.220
<v Speaker 1>princess kiss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can think of that.</v>

622
00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:13.800
<v Speaker 1>You can think of her being rescued by an</v>
<v Speaker 1>actual man.</v>

623
00:37:13.801 --> 00:37:17.400
<v Speaker 1>But you can also think of that as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>masculine part of her psyche,</v>

624
00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:18.563
<v Speaker 1>waking up her unconscious femininity so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the two of them can unite and rule </v>

625
00:37:22.021 --> 00:37:22.590
<v Speaker 1>the kingdom.</v>

626
00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:25.380
<v Speaker 1>It's perfectly reasonable interpretation</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that story.</v>

627
00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:26.753
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that would be the development of </v>

628
00:37:29.191 --> 00:37:30.490
<v Speaker 1>the masculine side in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

629
00:37:30.491 --> 00:37:31.324
<v Speaker 1>in a female that decide that stout </v>
<v Speaker 1>stalwart and forthright and willing to </v>

630
00:37:34.411 --> 00:37:37.180
<v Speaker 1>go forth into the world and con and </v>
<v Speaker 1>conquer uncertainty.</v>

631
00:37:37.181 --> 00:37:38.014
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's the beauty and the </v>

632
00:37:39.451 --> 00:37:41.090
<v Speaker 1>beast archetype,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is,</v>

633
00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:41.953
<v Speaker 1>is in some sense the primary female </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual archetype and beauty and the </v>

634
00:37:44.941 --> 00:37:47.470
<v Speaker 1>beast is another kind of dragon slaying </v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

635
00:37:47.471 --> 00:37:49.770
<v Speaker 1>It's more like a dragon taming story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose,</v>

636
00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:51.750
<v Speaker 1>where the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the woman,</v>

637
00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:54.300
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the virginal woman who's,</v>

638
00:37:54.301 --> 00:37:57.300
<v Speaker 1>who's out for an adventure finds a </v>
<v Speaker 1>beastly male.</v>

639
00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:00.450
<v Speaker 1>And that's the dangerous man that I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about earlier,</v>

640
00:38:00.451 --> 00:38:02.670
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The man who has the capacity say to kill</v>

641
00:38:02.671 --> 00:38:07.020
<v Speaker 1>the capacity to harm the capacity for </v>
<v Speaker 1>violence at hand,</v>

642
00:38:07.021 --> 00:38:10.320
<v Speaker 1>right at hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then proceeds to tame him,</v>

643
00:38:10.321 --> 00:38:11.490
<v Speaker 1>which is a real adventure.</v>

644
00:38:11.490 --> 00:38:12.323
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know that this is the case because </v>

645
00:38:13.831 --> 00:38:15.210
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can refer to those,</v>

646
00:38:15.211 --> 00:38:16.044
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bro or those raw rom coms that are so </v>

647
00:38:18.151 --> 00:38:18.984
<v Speaker 1>popular now with the failed Beta males </v>
<v Speaker 1>always trying to make friends with the </v>

648
00:38:22.051 --> 00:38:22.884
<v Speaker 1>girl and failing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The girls are interested in the rough </v>

649
00:38:24.781 --> 00:38:25.614
<v Speaker 1>guys who have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who have the capacity to also be </v>

650
00:38:28.231 --> 00:38:31.050
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated and to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's not say tamed,</v>

651
00:38:31.051 --> 00:38:35.920
<v Speaker 1>but civilized into channeling their </v>
<v Speaker 1>harsh roughness,</v>

652
00:38:35.950 --> 00:38:40.950
<v Speaker 1>their capacity for evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even into productive competition.</v>

653
00:38:41.171 --> 00:38:42.004
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and because competition can be very </v>

654
00:38:44.411 --> 00:38:45.244
<v Speaker 1>productive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the sharing fourth of the </v>

655
00:38:46.691 --> 00:38:49.360
<v Speaker 1>fruits of that competition with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with family.</v>

656
00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:52.920
<v Speaker 1>And so those are all heroic aspects of </v>
<v Speaker 1>feminine being and,</v>

657
00:38:52.921 --> 00:38:55.210
<v Speaker 1>and they're not to be taken lightly </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

658
00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:58.750
<v Speaker 1>Major life tasks and major life </v>
<v Speaker 1>contributions,</v>

659
00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:00.033
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I guess another part of the heroic </v>

660
00:39:01.361 --> 00:39:02.194
<v Speaker 1>element of the female is the subjugation</v>
<v Speaker 1>of her own privacy with regards to her </v>

661
00:39:07.361 --> 00:39:07.780
<v Speaker 1>child.</v>

662
00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:09.610
<v Speaker 1>Because my daughter just had a child by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way.</v>

663
00:39:09.611 --> 00:39:11.530
<v Speaker 1>So I'm a grandfather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so hooray for that.</v>

664
00:39:11.531 --> 00:39:14.590
<v Speaker 1>And it went really nicely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm so happy about that because a,</v>

665
00:39:14.591 --> 00:39:16.600
<v Speaker 1>I love my daughter and be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>

666
00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:19.420
<v Speaker 1>really liked kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're so great.</v>

667
00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:21.790
<v Speaker 1>And so now I've got to have kid around </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

668
00:39:21.791 --> 00:39:23.560
<v Speaker 1>So that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

669
00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:24.663
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you notice very </v>

670
00:39:25.361 --> 00:39:26.194
<v Speaker 1>rapidly if you're a parent is that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>bring someone into the world who is now </v>

671
00:39:29.441 --> 00:39:32.260
<v Speaker 1>more important under all circumstances </v>
<v Speaker 1>than you are.</v>

672
00:39:32.261 --> 00:39:33.094
<v Speaker 1>And there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a heroic subjugation of </v>

673
00:39:35.291 --> 00:39:37.510
<v Speaker 1>selfishness that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that goes along with that.</v>

674
00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:40.510
<v Speaker 1>That's characteristic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Deeply characteristic of the property,</v>

675
00:39:40.511 --> 00:39:41.344
<v Speaker 1>develop feminine spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what is that that you are doing to </v>

676
00:39:45.371 --> 00:39:46.204
<v Speaker 1>avoid becoming arrogant?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're current situation is very </v>

677
00:39:48.401 --> 00:39:50.350
<v Speaker 1>inviting for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

678
00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:55.150
<v Speaker 1>well I would say a good dose of </v>
<v Speaker 1>existential terror curia that you know,</v>

679
00:39:55.151 --> 00:39:55.984
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a saying in the old testament </v>

680
00:39:57.491 --> 00:39:59.800
<v Speaker 1>that the fear of God is the beginning of</v>
<v Speaker 1>wisdom and like,</v>

681
00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:02.590
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's some real truth in that,</v>

682
00:40:02.591 --> 00:40:04.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I don't want to make a mistake.</v>

683
00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:05.613
<v Speaker 1>And so I live in constant terror that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to utter some damning phrase </v>

684
00:40:10.481 --> 00:40:12.460
<v Speaker 1>that's going to sync everything I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

685
00:40:12.461 --> 00:40:13.294
<v Speaker 1>And so I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you feel that way about the </v>

686
00:40:14.861 --> 00:40:15.694
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then either probability that you're </v>

687
00:40:18.011 --> 00:40:18.844
<v Speaker 1>going to be arrogant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty damn low and like I don't </v>

688
00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:22.420
<v Speaker 1>feel I have any reason to be arrogant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

689
00:40:22.690 --> 00:40:23.523
<v Speaker 1>like here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's something you could do if you're </v>

690
00:40:24.911 --> 00:40:26.860
<v Speaker 1>really interested in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's really hard.</v>

691
00:40:26.861 --> 00:40:27.694
<v Speaker 1>There's a paper by Carl Jung called the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relations between the ego and </v>

692
00:40:29.951 --> 00:40:33.970
<v Speaker 1>nonconscious and it's an unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant paper.</v>

693
00:40:33.971 --> 00:40:34.804
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it has to do with what young called </v>

694
00:40:37.001 --> 00:40:37.834
<v Speaker 1>ego inflation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so imagine that as you move up a </v>

695
00:40:41.141 --> 00:40:41.974
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy of authority or competence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to call them dominance </v>

696
00:40:44.831 --> 00:40:47.380
<v Speaker 1>or power hierarchies because I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that's reasonable.</v>

697
00:40:47.530 --> 00:40:49.090
<v Speaker 1>But as you move up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you're,</v>

698
00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:49.953
<v Speaker 1>you have the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have the temptation of having your </v>

699
00:40:52.181 --> 00:40:56.230
<v Speaker 1>ego inflate to match your hypothetical </v>
<v Speaker 1>position of status.</v>

700
00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:57.063
<v Speaker 1>But what that is is in some sense the </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking on of the archetype as if it's a </v>

701
00:41:01.811 --> 00:41:06.550
<v Speaker 1>personal triumph or a personal construct</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a per personal invention,</v>

702
00:41:06.551 --> 00:41:09.130
<v Speaker 1>and you'll one very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very strongly against that.</v>

703
00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:10.103
<v Speaker 1>And he knew what he was talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of course you had his followers </v>

704
00:41:12.431 --> 00:41:13.264
<v Speaker 1>and was an extraordinarily powerful man </v>
<v Speaker 1>from a spiritual and a physical </v>

705
00:41:15.761 --> 00:41:16.594
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was certainly no pushover and a very </v>

706
00:41:18.191 --> 00:41:21.640
<v Speaker 1>brave person and he had the temptation </v>
<v Speaker 1>of becoming,</v>

707
00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:23.260
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cult leader for example,</v>

708
00:41:23.261 --> 00:41:25.060
<v Speaker 1>which people have accused him of being </v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

709
00:41:25.061 --> 00:41:27.640
<v Speaker 1>which he certainly wasn't and he knew </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

710
00:41:28.330 --> 00:41:29.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

711
00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:34.200
<v Speaker 1>if you have the privilege of in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a hierarchy,</v>

712
00:41:35.690 --> 00:41:38.420
<v Speaker 1>what that means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that rising is real,</v>

713
00:41:38.421 --> 00:41:39.254
<v Speaker 1>is that the archetype is operating </v>
<v Speaker 1>through you and that you can't take </v>

714
00:41:42.291 --> 00:41:43.670
<v Speaker 1>credit for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to,</v>

715
00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:47.150
<v Speaker 1>you have to separate your personality in</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense from the architect.</v>

716
00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:49.820
<v Speaker 1>I can give you a funny example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

717
00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:53.540
<v Speaker 1>and I hope that nobody takes this wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's very comical.</v>

718
00:41:53.690 --> 00:41:56.210
<v Speaker 1>You know how all the superheroes have an</v>
<v Speaker 1>alter ego.</v>

719
00:41:56.840 --> 00:42:00.290
<v Speaker 1>So you can't be superman unless you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>also Clark Kent and you can't be,</v>

720
00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:02.390
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Batman isn't such a good example because</v>

721
00:42:02.391 --> 00:42:04.820
<v Speaker 1>he gets to be playboy billionaire like </v>
<v Speaker 1>iron man,</v>

722
00:42:04.821 --> 00:42:06.530
<v Speaker 1>but Superman's better example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

723
00:42:06.531 --> 00:42:10.960
<v Speaker 1>he's this mild mannered in meek reporter</v>
<v Speaker 1>and without that he can't be superman.</v>

724
00:42:11.090 --> 00:42:11.923
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's the reason that's such a </v>

725
00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:18.710
<v Speaker 1>well established comic trope is because </v>
<v Speaker 1>comics are deeply mythological.</v>

726
00:42:18.711 --> 00:42:22.760
<v Speaker 1>And there's the idea there that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>person has these two elements.</v>

727
00:42:22.761 --> 00:42:26.600
<v Speaker 1>One is the archetipal and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with the infinite.</v>

728
00:42:26.601 --> 00:42:29.030
<v Speaker 1>It's like the God in man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could say that.</v>

729
00:42:29.490 --> 00:42:30.323
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a great icon by the way of </v>

730
00:42:31.971 --> 00:42:35.690
<v Speaker 1>Christ as pantokrator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the very earliest icons that show</v>

731
00:42:35.691 --> 00:42:38.960
<v Speaker 1>him with two different facial halves.</v>

732
00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:39.853
<v Speaker 1>The eyes are different and the face is </v>
<v Speaker 1>asymmetrical and one one face is the </v>

733
00:42:43.401 --> 00:42:44.234
<v Speaker 1>face of God have faces to have face of </v>
<v Speaker 1>God and the other is the half face of </v>

734
00:42:46.911 --> 00:42:48.170
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's holding a book.</v>

735
00:42:48.171 --> 00:42:49.004
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm having Jonathan Pashto who's a </v>

736
00:42:50.841 --> 00:42:51.674
<v Speaker 1>brilliant carver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm having him carved me that image so </v>

737
00:42:54.711 --> 00:42:58.520
<v Speaker 1>that I can put it in my front porch </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I love it in a Christ is holding</v>

738
00:42:58.521 --> 00:42:59.390
<v Speaker 1>a book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

739
00:42:59.391 --> 00:42:59.871
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

740
00:42:59.871 --> 00:43:00.704
<v Speaker 1>it's such a beautiful image,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this idea of man as a duality between </v>

741
00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:09.230
<v Speaker 1>the finite and the infinite and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and simultaneously holding forth this,</v>

742
00:43:09.231 --> 00:43:11.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wealth of knowledge that's been gathered</v>

743
00:43:11.241 --> 00:43:16.100
<v Speaker 1>by the human race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's mine mind expanding visual imagery.</v>

744
00:43:16.970 --> 00:43:17.840
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

745
00:43:18.590 --> 00:43:20.840
<v Speaker 1>back to the arrogance issue is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

746
00:43:20.841 --> 00:43:24.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so Kara co I'm so what would you say</v>

747
00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:26.173
<v Speaker 1>attuned to the fact that I'm barely </v>
<v Speaker 1>staying on that line between chaos and </v>

748
00:43:29.751 --> 00:43:30.584
<v Speaker 1>order and that any foolishness on my </v>
<v Speaker 1>part or any attempt to manipulate the </v>

749
00:43:34.461 --> 00:43:37.250
<v Speaker 1>situation for my own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say selfish,</v>

750
00:43:37.251 --> 00:43:38.630
<v Speaker 1>personal gain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

751
00:43:38.631 --> 00:43:40.920
<v Speaker 1>that sort of impulsive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

752
00:43:41.330 --> 00:43:44.290
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and shallow and immature and,</v>

753
00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:47.540
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and shortsighted personal gain that,</v>

754
00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:48.433
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that willingness or wished to Lord it </v>

755
00:43:50.001 --> 00:43:52.910
<v Speaker 1>over other people or to feel in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense superior man.</v>

756
00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:55.760
<v Speaker 1>If I go there with the exposure that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got right now,</v>

757
00:43:55.761 --> 00:43:57.800
<v Speaker 1>I'd be so fast that it wouldn't even be </v>
<v Speaker 1>funny.</v>

758
00:43:57.801 --> 00:44:00.080
<v Speaker 1>And that would not be pretty and I would</v>
<v Speaker 1>not want that.</v>

759
00:44:00.081 --> 00:44:00.914
<v Speaker 1>So I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing my best man to keep myself on </v>

760
00:44:04.101 --> 00:44:04.934
<v Speaker 1>the ground and whereas where I want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be and I've got my family to help me </v>

761
00:44:08.151 --> 00:44:10.400
<v Speaker 1>without and I've got my friends who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>offering me,</v>

762
00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:13.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>corrective criticism on an ongoing basis</v>

763
00:44:13.161 --> 00:44:13.994
<v Speaker 1>and I listened to the negative comments </v>
<v Speaker 1>on eat on youtube and I try to pay </v>

764
00:44:16.461 --> 00:44:19.550
<v Speaker 1>attention to them and evaluate them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>not just dismiss them out of hand.</v>

765
00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:20.953
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if their crude or crass or any of those </v>

766
00:44:22.281 --> 00:44:24.590
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I'm less likely to pay attention to</v>

767
00:44:24.591 --> 00:44:25.490
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

768
00:44:25.491 --> 00:44:28.280
<v Speaker 1>even when I'm called far right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I pay attention to that.</v>

769
00:44:28.281 --> 00:44:29.114
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because well you got to listen to your </v>

770
00:44:31.531 --> 00:44:31.860
<v Speaker 1>enemy.</v>

771
00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:33.840
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another new testament.</v>

772
00:44:33.841 --> 00:44:34.674
<v Speaker 1>In junction you should listen to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>enemy because your enemy will tell you </v>

773
00:44:36.691 --> 00:44:39.150
<v Speaker 1>things about yourself that no one else </v>
<v Speaker 1>will tell you.</v>

774
00:44:39.390 --> 00:44:41.160
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of those things might not be true,</v>

775
00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:42.053
<v Speaker 1>but some of the might be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if your enemy tells you something </v>

776
00:44:44.011 --> 00:44:45.750
<v Speaker 1>terrible about yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true,</v>

777
00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:47.820
<v Speaker 1>then he's immediately become your best </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend.</v>

778
00:44:47.821 --> 00:44:48.654
<v Speaker 1>Because you bloody well want to know if </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something terrible about you so </v>

779
00:44:51.211 --> 00:44:52.044
<v Speaker 1>that you can get it rectified before it </v>
<v Speaker 1>ruins your life and ruins your family's </v>

780
00:44:55.291 --> 00:44:56.124
<v Speaker 1>life and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>detrimentally affects the course of the </v>

781
00:44:58.831 --> 00:45:00.270
<v Speaker 1>world and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

782
00:45:00.810 --> 00:45:01.643
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in one of your lectures you said the </v>

783
00:45:03.031 --> 00:45:05.610
<v Speaker 1>film frozen was garbage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I said garbage.</v>

784
00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:09.480
<v Speaker 1>I think I said reprehensible propaganda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I believe it was.</v>

785
00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:11.760
<v Speaker 1>Can you elaborate on your thoughts on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the film?</v>

786
00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:14.850
<v Speaker 1>I can't because I haven't seen it </v>
<v Speaker 1>recently enough to,</v>

787
00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:16.033
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only thing I can say is that I left </v>

788
00:45:17.311 --> 00:45:18.144
<v Speaker 1>the film with a strong sense that it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>produced for ideological reasons and it </v>

789
00:45:21.571 --> 00:45:23.970
<v Speaker 1>was produced as a sort of anti sleeping </v>
<v Speaker 1>beauty.</v>

790
00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:24.803
<v Speaker 1>And I felt that was entirely </v>
<v Speaker 1>inappropriate because it wasn't a </v>

791
00:45:27.691 --> 00:45:30.360
<v Speaker 1>genuine artistic attempt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was an ideological statement.</v>

792
00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:33.750
<v Speaker 1>I actually really liked [inaudible] I </v>
<v Speaker 1>hope I'm pronouncing that properly.</v>

793
00:45:33.751 --> 00:45:35.640
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked that,</v>

794
00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:36.503
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that little girl in the movie allied </v>

795
00:45:37.711 --> 00:45:38.544
<v Speaker 1>herself with is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very powerful but rather uncivilized </v>

796
00:45:41.191 --> 00:45:42.024
<v Speaker 1>masculine force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought they got the archetypal </v>

797
00:45:43.770 --> 00:45:46.200
<v Speaker 1>balance in that film really quite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really quite nicely.</v>

798
00:45:46.201 --> 00:45:48.200
<v Speaker 1>So I thought it was quite beautifully </v>
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

799
00:45:48.220 --> 00:45:52.710
<v Speaker 1>So I liked Marianna quite a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What were you like when I was 25?</v>

800
00:45:54.050 --> 00:45:55.740
<v Speaker 1>Hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

801
00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:58.950
<v Speaker 1>I was obsessed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm 25,</v>

802
00:45:58.951 --> 00:45:59.784
<v Speaker 1>so that would have been 87.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd been in graduate school for two </v>

803
00:46:02.161 --> 00:46:03.240
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

804
00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:04.973
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

805
00:46:05.430 --> 00:46:10.050
<v Speaker 1>when I was 25 or so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably weighed about 138 pounds.</v>

806
00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:15.080
<v Speaker 1>I smoked like a pack of cigarettes day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I drank tremendous amount of alcohol.</v>

807
00:46:15.721 --> 00:46:16.554
<v Speaker 1>I was from northern Alberta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this rough little town up in northern </v>

808
00:46:18.571 --> 00:46:19.610
<v Speaker 1>Alberta called fairview.</v>

809
00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:20.453
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were long winters there and my </v>

810
00:46:21.721 --> 00:46:22.554
<v Speaker 1>friends were heavy drinkers and most of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them dropped out of school by the time </v>

811
00:46:24.901 --> 00:46:27.690
<v Speaker 1>they were 15 or 16.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Went off to work on the oil rigs.</v>

812
00:46:27.691 --> 00:46:31.260
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a rough town and we drank a lot.</v>

813
00:46:31.261 --> 00:46:33.810
<v Speaker 1>And I started when I was 14.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

814
00:46:33.870 --> 00:46:37.080
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I was,</v>

815
00:46:37.110 --> 00:46:39.000
<v Speaker 1>I had a lot of bad habits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

816
00:46:39.001 --> 00:46:39.834
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

817
00:46:40.290 --> 00:46:42.600
<v Speaker 1>things that were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I wasn't in great shape physically,</v>

818
00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:47.100
<v Speaker 1>and I was also still intellectually </v>
<v Speaker 1>obsessed by as I am now.</v>

819
00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:48.413
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

820
00:46:49.110 --> 00:46:51.660
<v Speaker 1>so that would've been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would've been an 85,</v>

821
00:46:51.661 --> 00:46:54.870
<v Speaker 1>but when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I decided around that about 85,</v>

822
00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:57.570
<v Speaker 1>84 or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a little earlier that I was really</v>

823
00:46:57.571 --> 00:46:59.910
<v Speaker 1>going to try to get my act together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

824
00:46:59.911 --> 00:47:02.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I started doing that.</v>

825
00:47:02.161 --> 00:47:02.880
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

826
00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:03.713
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

827
00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:05.520
<v Speaker 1>I quit smoking.</v>

828
00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:06.653
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that took a long time because I </v>

829
00:47:07.141 --> 00:47:09.750
<v Speaker 1>eventually had to quit drinking too in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order to quit smoking.</v>

830
00:47:09.751 --> 00:47:13.110
<v Speaker 1>And I started working out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>started playing sports,</v>

831
00:47:13.111 --> 00:47:14.850
<v Speaker 1>which I'd never done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a small kid.</v>

832
00:47:14.851 --> 00:47:17.190
<v Speaker 1>I been skipped a grade and I was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>small,</v>

833
00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:19.380
<v Speaker 1>small for my age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So sports were never,</v>

834
00:47:19.381 --> 00:47:23.130
<v Speaker 1>especially team sports were never really</v>
<v Speaker 1>a domain of expertise for me.</v>

835
00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:24.373
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I skied and went trapping with </v>

836
00:47:25.831 --> 00:47:26.664
<v Speaker 1>my dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went,</v>

837
00:47:26.910 --> 00:47:29.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cross country skiing and camping and all</v>

838
00:47:29.201 --> 00:47:30.034
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

839
00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:31.030
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

840
00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:35.080
<v Speaker 1>when I went to graduate school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started swimming the first,</v>

841
00:47:35.770 --> 00:47:36.790
<v Speaker 1>the first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

842
00:47:37.870 --> 00:47:42.760
<v Speaker 1>physical exercise routine I did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I enrolled in a swim suicides course,</v>

843
00:47:42.761 --> 00:47:43.594
<v Speaker 1>I think it was called.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was me and this like really </v>

844
00:47:44.741 --> 00:47:47.920
<v Speaker 1>overweight kid and like these 60 year </v>
<v Speaker 1>old women and men,</v>

845
00:47:47.921 --> 00:47:48.754
<v Speaker 1>they could out exercise me like mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was really embarrassing me in the </v>

846
00:47:51.490 --> 00:47:52.630
<v Speaker 1>overweight kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

847
00:47:52.631 --> 00:47:53.464
<v Speaker 1>we'd be just panting ourselves three </v>
<v Speaker 1>quarters to death at the end of the </v>

848
00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:56.733
<v Speaker 1>bloody workout in these 60 year old </v>
<v Speaker 1>women who weren't in great shape or </v>

849
00:47:59.351 --> 00:47:59.861
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

850
00:47:59.861 --> 00:48:03.580
<v Speaker 1>chatting away as if nothing was going on</v>
<v Speaker 1>at all in the pool.</v>

851
00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:08.140
<v Speaker 1>So that was quite embarrassing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as was going to the weight room,</v>

852
00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:09.273
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because when I started I could barely </v>

853
00:48:10.151 --> 00:48:14.170
<v Speaker 1>best bench press 75 pounds and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>used to keep coming over and helping me,</v>

854
00:48:14.171 --> 00:48:17.070
<v Speaker 1>which was last thing I bloody well </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted but certainly needed.</v>

855
00:48:17.071 --> 00:48:20.380
<v Speaker 1>And I got to the point where I could </v>
<v Speaker 1>bench press 225 pounds.</v>

856
00:48:20.381 --> 00:48:21.214
<v Speaker 1>I think that was the best I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I gained about 30 pounds of muscle </v>

857
00:48:23.291 --> 00:48:26.140
<v Speaker 1>in a year and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was good thing.</v>

858
00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:28.960
<v Speaker 1>So like I was kind of a wild man and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

859
00:48:28.961 --> 00:48:31.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm a little bit manic in my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my,</v>

860
00:48:31.091 --> 00:48:32.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>temperament and so,</v>

861
00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:33.473
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

862
00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:36.550
<v Speaker 1>I was kind of going every direction at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same time,</v>

863
00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:38.620
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

864
00:48:39.070 --> 00:48:39.903
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't regret that I had a fine time </v>

865
00:48:41.321 --> 00:48:45.700
<v Speaker 1>when I was a kid and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I needed really to get disciplined and I</v>

866
00:48:45.701 --> 00:48:49.420
<v Speaker 1>had to do it because I was working on </v>
<v Speaker 1>these hard problems that,</v>

867
00:48:49.690 --> 00:48:50.523
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I've been discussing with all of </v>

868
00:48:51.521 --> 00:48:53.230
<v Speaker 1>you and I've been working on them </v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

869
00:48:53.530 --> 00:48:54.363
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obsessively since I was probably about </v>

870
00:48:57.071 --> 00:48:58.680
<v Speaker 1>18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe even earlier than that.</v>

871
00:48:59.140 --> 00:48:59.973
<v Speaker 1>Got to the point around 25 when I was in</v>
<v Speaker 1>graduate school trying to get my Phd's </v>

872
00:49:03.380 --> 00:49:06.430
<v Speaker 1>doing all my research.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I published 15 papers by the time I</v>

873
00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:07.413
<v Speaker 1>graduated with my phd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was by I think by a fairly large </v>

874
00:49:10.301 --> 00:49:11.134
<v Speaker 1>measure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most papers that any graduate </v>

875
00:49:12.401 --> 00:49:14.410
<v Speaker 1>student at that time it ever published </v>
<v Speaker 1>at mcgill.</v>

876
00:49:14.530 --> 00:49:15.363
<v Speaker 1>I think that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Might have been twice as many or maybe </v>

877
00:49:17.050 --> 00:49:19.120
<v Speaker 1>twice as many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe even three times as many.</v>

878
00:49:19.450 --> 00:49:21.280
<v Speaker 1>And at the same time I wrote maps of </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning,</v>

879
00:49:21.281 --> 00:49:23.110
<v Speaker 1>which was a terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible,</v>

880
00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:24.333
<v Speaker 1>terribly difficult thing to do cause I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was writing about three hours a day </v>

881
00:49:26.771 --> 00:49:31.480
<v Speaker 1>doing that and I couldn't do all that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and continue with my misbehavior.</v>

882
00:49:31.481 --> 00:49:33.490
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my sort of my,</v>

883
00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:34.960
<v Speaker 1>what would you say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>

884
00:49:35.230 --> 00:49:37.420
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my hedonistic,</v>

885
00:49:38.010 --> 00:49:41.710
<v Speaker 1>my hedonistic</v>
<v Speaker 1>ma,</v>

886
00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:45.340
<v Speaker 1>my massive hedonistic consumption of </v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol and all of that.</v>

887
00:49:45.341 --> 00:49:46.174
<v Speaker 1>I just couldn't keep it up and also work</v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously on the issues that were at </v>

888
00:49:48.881 --> 00:49:49.180
<v Speaker 1>hand.</v>

889
00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:51.220
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to stop.</v>

890
00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:56.140
<v Speaker 1>That's a sacrifice I had to stop messing</v>
<v Speaker 1>about and straight myself out.</v>

891
00:49:56.141 --> 00:49:59.470
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got married when my,</v>

892
00:49:59.740 --> 00:50:02.920
<v Speaker 1>the woman who is my wife Tammy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who I've known since she was eight years</v>

893
00:50:02.921 --> 00:50:03.754
<v Speaker 1>old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she lived across the street from me and </v>

894
00:50:04.381 --> 00:50:07.540
<v Speaker 1>this little town called fairview and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was in love with her like the first time</v>

895
00:50:07.541 --> 00:50:09.490
<v Speaker 1>I saw her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is quite bloody thing.</v>

896
00:50:09.790 --> 00:50:10.623
<v Speaker 1>So that's worked out pretty well for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But she came to live with me about the </v>

897
00:50:14.171 --> 00:50:15.010
<v Speaker 1>same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

898
00:50:15.011 --> 00:50:15.844
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we decided jointly to get our act </v>

899
00:50:17.261 --> 00:50:19.270
<v Speaker 1>together and we swore that we tell each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other the truth,</v>

900
00:50:19.271 --> 00:50:21.370
<v Speaker 1>which I think she's actually done better</v>
<v Speaker 1>than me.</v>

901
00:50:21.371 --> 00:50:22.204
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think she's lied to me ever in </v>

902
00:50:24.551 --> 00:50:26.800
<v Speaker 1>our entire marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is unbelievable.</v>

903
00:50:26.801 --> 00:50:29.420
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been so useful because I can really</v>

904
00:50:29.421 --> 00:50:31.970
<v Speaker 1>tell her things that we can really talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I tell you,</v>

905
00:50:31.971 --> 00:50:33.590
<v Speaker 1>if you want to have a good relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

906
00:50:33.890 --> 00:50:34.723
<v Speaker 1>you embedded in the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you don't embed it in the </v>

907
00:50:36.501 --> 00:50:37.880
<v Speaker 1>truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have a relationship.</v>

908
00:50:37.881 --> 00:50:39.110
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just lies.</v>

909
00:50:39.111 --> 00:50:41.090
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a tissue of lies and it will,</v>

910
00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:45.050
<v Speaker 1>it will dissolve in the chaos as soon as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a crisis comes along.</v>

911
00:50:45.051 --> 00:50:47.450
<v Speaker 1>So the truth is a terrible thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not,</v>

912
00:50:47.540 --> 00:50:49.730
<v Speaker 1>not compared to false hood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

913
00:50:50.610 --> 00:50:52.640
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's look at the live chat here.</v>

914
00:50:53.790 --> 00:50:54.623
<v Speaker 3>MMM.</v>

915
00:51:08.990 --> 00:51:09.823
<v Speaker 1>Please get a better quality microphone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While I'm really hoping that the </v>

916
00:51:12.111 --> 00:51:15.260
<v Speaker 1>microphone that I'm using right now is </v>
<v Speaker 1>working well,</v>

917
00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:16.850
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it should be,</v>

918
00:51:16.851 --> 00:51:18.680
<v Speaker 1>it's a really good microphone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

919
00:51:18.681 --> 00:51:19.514
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

920
00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:21.620
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you call on a road?</v>

921
00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:25.160
<v Speaker 1>And I thought I was using it for quite a</v>
<v Speaker 1>while there,</v>

922
00:51:25.161 --> 00:51:29.840
<v Speaker 1>but I'd reorganized my office and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually had unplugged the road.</v>

923
00:51:29.841 --> 00:51:30.674
<v Speaker 1>And so my voice was unwittingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unbeknownst to me coming through this </v>

924
00:51:33.621 --> 00:51:34.850
<v Speaker 1>little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

925
00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:35.953
<v Speaker 1>large tech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high def micro or a video camera that I </v>

926
00:51:39.141 --> 00:51:42.320
<v Speaker 1>have on top of my speakers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it might even be doing that for now.</v>

927
00:51:42.410 --> 00:51:44.390
<v Speaker 1>Right now as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for all I know,</v>

928
00:51:44.570 --> 00:51:46.400
<v Speaker 1>I hope not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

929
00:51:46.401 --> 00:51:49.910
<v Speaker 1>it says the microphone is road in team n</v>
<v Speaker 1>t u s B.</v>

930
00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:51.313
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

931
00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:55.700
<v Speaker 1>maybe God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope so.</v>

932
00:51:56.360 --> 00:51:57.200
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

933
00:51:57.230 --> 00:51:58.063
<v Speaker 1>I've been mastering a lot of technical </v>
<v Speaker 1>equipment in the last year and so I've </v>

934
00:52:02.091 --> 00:52:02.924
<v Speaker 1>got most of it under control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know if I have all of it </v>

935
00:52:04.581 --> 00:52:07.760
<v Speaker 1>under control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So some fan,</v>

936
00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:10.040
<v Speaker 1>and I wish I remembered his name because</v>
<v Speaker 1>he deserves it.</v>

937
00:52:10.041 --> 00:52:13.150
<v Speaker 1>Sent me this microphone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Hooray for him and hopefully I'm,</v>

938
00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:15.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get access to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

939
00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:17.960
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see here.</v>

940
00:52:27.290 --> 00:52:28.123
<v Speaker 1>I'm 20.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My parents had made it clear they don't </v>

941
00:52:29.751 --> 00:52:31.910
<v Speaker 1>want me to leave home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are both drug addicted,</v>

942
00:52:34.190 --> 00:52:36.800
<v Speaker 1>depressed and antisocial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do I leave without killing?</v>

943
00:52:36.801 --> 00:52:38.630
<v Speaker 1>The only positive relationship they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

944
00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:41.450
<v Speaker 1>Well I think you'll have to ask yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>a different question.</v>

945
00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:46.760
<v Speaker 1>I think you might have to ask yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>the question of how do you maintain that</v>

946
00:52:46.761 --> 00:52:50.600
<v Speaker 1>positive relationship into the future if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't leave and have your own life.</v>

947
00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:51.913
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause you have to be thinking over five </v>

948
00:52:53.211 --> 00:52:55.370
<v Speaker 1>year periods here or even decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And first of all,</v>

949
00:52:55.371 --> 00:52:56.204
<v Speaker 1>you deserve to have your own life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like your parents should be fostering </v>

950
00:52:59.781 --> 00:53:00.614
<v Speaker 1>your independence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's their moral duty to foster your </v>

951
00:53:02.391 --> 00:53:03.224
<v Speaker 1>independence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now hopefully they can do that in a way </v>

952
00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:05.623
<v Speaker 1>that makes you strong and that makes you</v>
<v Speaker 1>better able to have a relationship with </v>

953
00:53:08.631 --> 00:53:11.210
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they have no right to use their,</v>

954
00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:12.980
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their dependence,</v>

955
00:53:12.981 --> 00:53:13.814
<v Speaker 1>let's say as an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an impediment to you becoming </v>

956
00:53:16.971 --> 00:53:19.100
<v Speaker 1>independent drug,</v>
<v Speaker 1>addicted,</v>

957
00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:20.810
<v Speaker 1>antidepressant and anti antisocial.</v>

958
00:53:20.930 --> 00:53:22.550
<v Speaker 1>Despite all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they should be saying,</v>

959
00:53:22.551 --> 00:53:25.230
<v Speaker 1>you get the hell away from us as fast as</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can and you get out there and have a</v>

960
00:53:25.231 --> 00:53:27.150
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you can put yourself together and</v>

961
00:53:27.151 --> 00:53:30.150
<v Speaker 1>we get to see you from time to time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't that be a wonderful thing?</v>

962
00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:32.700
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

963
00:53:33.060 --> 00:53:35.820
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't get in your children's way,</v>

964
00:53:35.970 --> 00:53:38.580
<v Speaker 1>you don't get in your children's way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

965
00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:40.050
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

966
00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:43.800
<v Speaker 1>and I can't give you advice because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know you and the devil's always in</v>

967
00:53:43.801 --> 00:53:44.634
<v Speaker 1>the details,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can say generally that you won't </v>

968
00:53:47.311 --> 00:53:48.144
<v Speaker 1>be able to maintain a positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with your parents if you </v>

969
00:53:49.861 --> 00:53:52.440
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at the cost of your own destiny.</v>

970
00:53:52.470 --> 00:53:54.420
<v Speaker 1>Let's say that that isn't going to work </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

971
00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:57.330
<v Speaker 1>So when no one has the right to deprive </v>
<v Speaker 1>you of that destiny,</v>

972
00:53:57.390 --> 00:53:59.460
<v Speaker 1>family or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

973
00:53:59.530 --> 00:54:00.363
<v Speaker 1>you're to operate out there in the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an independent soul and to make </v>

974
00:54:04.231 --> 00:54:05.064
<v Speaker 1>your way through the world and to offer </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you have to offer and those who </v>

975
00:54:07.291 --> 00:54:08.124
<v Speaker 1>love you should be behind you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>encouraging you to do that in every </v>

976
00:54:11.401 --> 00:54:13.020
<v Speaker 1>possible way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if they aren't,</v>

977
00:54:13.021 --> 00:54:16.050
<v Speaker 1>then you have to seriously think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not a,</v>

978
00:54:16.051 --> 00:54:18.690
<v Speaker 1>whether or not they have your best </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest in mind and B,</v>

979
00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:19.673
<v Speaker 1>whether or not it might be better for </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and for them if you went and did </v>

980
00:54:22.380 --> 00:54:25.980
<v Speaker 1>what you needed to do anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would say that.</v>

981
00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:27.413
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

982
00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:29.240
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

983
00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:32.450
<v Speaker 1>Do you have in mind a more specific </v>
<v Speaker 1>breakdown of the social sciences?</v>

984
00:54:32.570 --> 00:54:35.210
<v Speaker 1>I presume you mean in relationship to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the postmodern,</v>

985
00:54:35.390 --> 00:54:36.223
<v Speaker 1>neo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marxist and have taken over so much of </v>

986
00:54:37.491 --> 00:54:38.324
<v Speaker 1>the university?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say philosophy seems to be in </v>

987
00:54:40.371 --> 00:54:41.930
<v Speaker 1>pretty good shape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strangely enough.</v>

988
00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:44.470
<v Speaker 1>It isn't exactly clear why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

989
00:54:44.690 --> 00:54:45.523
<v Speaker 1>that's mostly my impression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that in the rest of the </v>

990
00:54:48.021 --> 00:54:48.854
<v Speaker 1>university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the discipline has at least one foot </v>

991
00:54:50.541 --> 00:54:53.540
<v Speaker 1>in science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's relatively safe.</v>

992
00:54:53.541 --> 00:54:54.374
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say psychology is </v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively safe discipline because it's </v>

993
00:54:56.991 --> 00:54:57.824
<v Speaker 1>quite nicely constrained by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessity of taking biology into </v>

994
00:55:00.111 --> 00:55:03.110
<v Speaker 1>account.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's less true with social psychology.</v>

995
00:55:03.350 --> 00:55:04.183
<v Speaker 1>But it's certainly true with clinical </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology and it's even more true with </v>

996
00:55:06.291 --> 00:55:09.420
<v Speaker 1>neuroscience and the animal behavioral </v>
<v Speaker 1>side of things and stay,</v>

997
00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:11.510
<v Speaker 1>well statistics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>statistics isn't science,</v>

998
00:55:11.511 --> 00:55:13.790
<v Speaker 1>but at least it's a rigorous methodology</v>
<v Speaker 1>methodologically.</v>

999
00:55:14.090 --> 00:55:18.500
<v Speaker 1>If the discipline is very heavy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heavily theoretically theory dependent,</v>

1000
00:55:18.501 --> 00:55:20.960
<v Speaker 1>like say sociology or let's say women's </v>
<v Speaker 1>studies,</v>

1001
00:55:20.961 --> 00:55:22.760
<v Speaker 1>which I have virtually no respect for.</v>

1002
00:55:23.230 --> 00:55:24.063
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that that's really relevant because </v>

1003
00:55:26.241 --> 00:55:28.100
<v Speaker 1>whether or not I respect it isn't the </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue.</v>

1004
00:55:28.101 --> 00:55:30.950
<v Speaker 1>The issue is whether or not it actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a high quality discipline.</v>

1005
00:55:30.951 --> 00:55:33.110
<v Speaker 1>And I don't believe it's a high quality </v>
<v Speaker 1>discipline at all.</v>

1006
00:55:33.620 --> 00:55:35.040
<v Speaker 1>I would also say though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

1007
00:55:35.060 --> 00:55:35.893
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to make a video about this</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the next couple of weeks and advice </v>

1008
00:55:38.151 --> 00:55:40.850
<v Speaker 1>to university students when I launched </v>
<v Speaker 1>that website,</v>

1009
00:55:40.851 --> 00:55:45.440
<v Speaker 1>had been talking about that helps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll help people identify their courses</v>

1010
00:55:45.441 --> 00:55:46.274
<v Speaker 1>as postmodern slash neo Marxist so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can either take them if they want </v>

1011
00:55:49.731 --> 00:55:52.850
<v Speaker 1>to be indoctrinated or avoid them if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to actually have an education.</v>

1012
00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:56.930
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's your responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1013
00:55:56.970 --> 00:56:01.970
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's your responsibility to get educated</v>

1014
00:56:02.481 --> 00:56:05.840
<v Speaker 1>at university and sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite the university we could,</v>

1015
00:56:05.841 --> 00:56:07.610
<v Speaker 1>we could say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1016
00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:11.710
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are great books.</v>

1017
00:56:11.740 --> 00:56:12.573
<v Speaker 1>You can find out what they are and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can read them and you know what the </v>

1018
00:56:15.281 --> 00:56:17.280
<v Speaker 1>university does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Society is our,</v>

1019
00:56:17.281 --> 00:56:19.900
<v Speaker 1>for you and identity for four years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a student,</v>

1020
00:56:19.930 --> 00:56:23.050
<v Speaker 1>you're a university student.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a credible identity.</v>

1021
00:56:23.230 --> 00:56:25.300
<v Speaker 1>It offers you a lot of freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you might say,</v>

1022
00:56:25.540 --> 00:56:29.380
<v Speaker 1>you might have to get educated despite </v>
<v Speaker 1>your courses and you know,</v>

1023
00:56:29.410 --> 00:56:30.243
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's a bad deal because the </v>

1024
00:56:31.181 --> 00:56:32.950
<v Speaker 1>courses should be educating you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1025
00:56:32.951 --> 00:56:33.784
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to look at it from a more </v>

1026
00:56:35.171 --> 00:56:36.004
<v Speaker 1>realistic perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't expect the university to be a </v>

1027
00:56:37.991 --> 00:56:38.824
<v Speaker 1>perfect institution any more than you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>a perfect person and at least it offers </v>

1028
00:56:42.761 --> 00:56:43.594
<v Speaker 1>you an identity to shield yourself with </v>
<v Speaker 1>while you're undergoing the difficult </v>

1029
00:56:48.070 --> 00:56:50.740
<v Speaker 1>process of educating yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say,</v>

1030
00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:52.630
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1031
00:56:54.260 --> 00:56:55.093
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1032
00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:57.033
<v Speaker 1>take responsibility for education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Find professors that you respect and </v>

1033
00:57:00.311 --> 00:57:03.080
<v Speaker 1>who's who and who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

1034
00:57:04.150 --> 00:57:05.530
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who challenge you.</v>

1035
00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:06.673
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and don't,</v>

1036
00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:08.710
<v Speaker 1>don't fall prey to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the,</v>

1037
00:57:08.770 --> 00:57:10.580
<v Speaker 1>to the cynical attitude that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1038
00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:13.420
<v Speaker 1>you take the course for the grade or </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you should write what the professor</v>

1039
00:57:13.421 --> 00:57:14.171
<v Speaker 1>wants to hear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1040
00:57:14.171 --> 00:57:17.590
<v Speaker 1>you have to be a real corrupt professor </v>
<v Speaker 1>before you'll mark a student for,</v>

1041
00:57:17.620 --> 00:57:20.110
<v Speaker 1>for producing an opinion contrary to </v>
<v Speaker 1>yours.</v>

1042
00:57:20.111 --> 00:57:21.160
<v Speaker 1>That's high quality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1043
00:57:21.161 --> 00:57:25.600
<v Speaker 1>even the more corrupt professors even in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more corrupt disciplines I think are</v>

1044
00:57:25.780 --> 00:57:28.240
<v Speaker 1>fairly rarely guilty of that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1045
00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:29.433
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1046
00:57:29.890 --> 00:57:34.270
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's grounded in science,</v>

1047
00:57:34.271 --> 00:57:35.110
<v Speaker 1>it's more likely to be</v>

1048
00:57:35.150 --> 00:57:37.190
<v Speaker 2>b,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a</v>

1049
00:57:38.110 --> 00:57:39.820
<v Speaker 1>reliable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the first thing to do.</v>

1050
00:57:39.850 --> 00:57:40.683
<v Speaker 1>But the second thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the second thing is to know what's </v>

1051
00:57:42.671 --> 00:57:43.504
<v Speaker 1>your responsibility to get educated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the libraries are full of great </v>

1052
00:57:45.851 --> 00:57:46.684
<v Speaker 1>books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can figure out what the great books </v>

1053
00:57:47.501 --> 00:57:47.981
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1054
00:57:47.981 --> 00:57:50.350
<v Speaker 1>in half an hour you could make list of </v>
<v Speaker 1>50 great books.</v>

1055
00:57:50.530 --> 00:57:53.320
<v Speaker 1>I have one on my website.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can read all those,</v>

1056
00:57:53.321 --> 00:57:54.154
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that takes about two years probably to </v>

1057
00:57:55.241 --> 00:57:58.390
<v Speaker 1>really do a proper job of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We read the great classics,</v>

1058
00:57:58.420 --> 00:58:00.850
<v Speaker 1>Scientific and Literary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>historical,</v>

1059
00:58:00.851 --> 00:58:01.684
<v Speaker 1>all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll get educated and then you'll be </v>

1060
00:58:03.491 --> 00:58:08.110
<v Speaker 1>sharp and coherent and articulate and </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful and able to formulate arguments</v>

1061
00:58:08.111 --> 00:58:12.340
<v Speaker 1>and able to negotiate and able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>formulate problems and solve them.</v>

1062
00:58:12.341 --> 00:58:13.174
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what you should be doing </v>

1063
00:58:14.321 --> 00:58:16.510
<v Speaker 1>when you get educated and it has </v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendous,</v>

1064
00:58:16.511 --> 00:58:17.344
<v Speaker 1>tremendous economic value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that includes education in the </v>

1065
00:58:19.631 --> 00:58:21.190
<v Speaker 1>humanities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1066
00:58:21.960 --> 00:58:25.720
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did I fail any classes in university?</v>

1067
00:58:26.350 --> 00:58:28.780
<v Speaker 1>I had to retake stats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't good at stats.</v>

1068
00:58:28.781 --> 00:58:30.850
<v Speaker 1>I got it eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1069
00:58:31.330 --> 00:58:32.320
<v Speaker 1>I needed to know,</v>

1070
00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:35.710
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm no mathematical genius,</v>

1071
00:58:35.711 --> 00:58:38.620
<v Speaker 1>we can start with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I also needed to know,</v>

1072
00:58:38.621 --> 00:58:40.480
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't take the assumptions on </v>
<v Speaker 1>faith,</v>

1073
00:58:40.481 --> 00:58:45.280
<v Speaker 1>which was really quite problematic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I couldn't just memorize,</v>

1074
00:58:45.281 --> 00:58:47.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to understand and that didn't work</v>

1075
00:58:47.561 --> 00:58:50.650
<v Speaker 1>out so well for stats analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't understand at that time that I</v>

1076
00:58:50.651 --> 00:58:52.540
<v Speaker 1>had to keep up with it sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>rigorously.</v>

1077
00:58:52.690 --> 00:58:54.670
<v Speaker 1>But I got to be a pretty decent </v>
<v Speaker 1>statistician.</v>

1078
00:58:54.671 --> 00:58:56.440
<v Speaker 1>At least I understand the statistics </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

1079
00:58:56.441 --> 00:58:58.450
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't do very well in statistics,</v>

1080
00:58:58.451 --> 00:58:59.284
<v Speaker 1>but most of my grades otherwise were </v>
<v Speaker 1>they in my grades in high school except </v>

1081
00:59:03.281 --> 00:59:04.114
<v Speaker 1>for grade 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I bet my dad that I could get a </v>

1082
00:59:06.370 --> 00:59:06.941
<v Speaker 1>straight eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think God,</v>

1083
00:59:06.941 --> 00:59:08.550
<v Speaker 1>exactly that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1084
00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:09.393
<v Speaker 1>my grades in junior high and high school</v>
<v Speaker 1>are pretty dismal because I absolutely </v>

1085
00:59:11.981 --> 00:59:14.980
<v Speaker 1>detested school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Partly for my own reasons,</v>

1086
00:59:14.981 --> 00:59:16.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of my own problems,</v>

1087
00:59:16.271 --> 00:59:17.104
<v Speaker 1>but an immaturity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But also because I found it painfully </v>

1088
00:59:21.890 --> 00:59:22.730
<v Speaker 1>unchallenging</v>

1089
00:59:22.760 --> 00:59:24.170
<v Speaker 4>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1090
00:59:24.230 --> 00:59:26.000
<v Speaker 4>but in university,</v>
<v Speaker 4>college and university,</v>

1091
00:59:26.001 --> 00:59:26.834
<v Speaker 4>I got very good grades and which was a </v>
<v Speaker 4>good thing because I would have never </v>

1092
00:59:28.941 --> 00:59:30.920
<v Speaker 4>got into clinical graduate school </v>
<v Speaker 4>without that.</v>

1093
00:59:30.921 --> 00:59:34.280
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to 25 pounds isn't bad.</v>

1094
00:59:34.281 --> 00:59:35.750
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well I only weighed one 60,</v>

1095
00:59:35.751 --> 00:59:37.040
<v Speaker 4>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was pretty good.</v>

1096
00:59:37.041 --> 00:59:40.310
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was funny because it was </v>
<v Speaker 4>only one day I was able to manage that.</v>

1097
00:59:40.311 --> 00:59:43.070
<v Speaker 4>I could do 200 with fair bit of </v>
<v Speaker 4>regularity and a bench press.</v>

1098
00:59:43.071 --> 00:59:43.904
<v Speaker 4>But one day man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did two oh five and that worked and I </v>

1099
00:59:46.671 --> 00:59:47.504
<v Speaker 4>did two 10 in that worked and I got all </v>
<v Speaker 4>the way to two 25 and I was never able </v>

1100
00:59:50.001 --> 00:59:52.610
<v Speaker 4>to duplicate it again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that was pretty interesting.</v>

1101
00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:53.953
<v Speaker 4>So jared,</v>
<v Speaker 4>chance as you claim hierarchies are </v>

1102
00:59:57.171 --> 01:00:01.250
<v Speaker 4>efficient enough yet you claim 99% of </v>
<v Speaker 4>creative people get stuck at the bottom.</v>

1103
01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:02.810
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

1104
01:00:02.810 --> 01:00:04.870
<v Speaker 4>Well that's not a contradiction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1105
01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:08.990
<v Speaker 4>what kind of propels you up?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hierarchies of authority is intelligence</v>

1106
01:00:08.991 --> 01:00:10.310
<v Speaker 4>and conscientiousness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1107
01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:11.960
<v Speaker 4>And so then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1108
01:00:11.961 --> 01:00:14.720
<v Speaker 4>what about creativity?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it looks like creativity.</v>

1109
01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:16.670
<v Speaker 4>Creativity is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as you sort of know,</v>

1110
01:00:16.671 --> 01:00:19.930
<v Speaker 4>is an out of the box phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the problem is,</v>

1111
01:00:19.931 --> 01:00:20.764
<v Speaker 4>is that if you're within a hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a ladder upward that you can </v>

1112
01:00:24.111 --> 01:00:24.944
<v Speaker 4>climb rung by rung.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And basically to do that you have to do </v>

1113
01:00:27.021 --> 01:00:28.700
<v Speaker 4>your damn job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>

1114
01:00:29.210 --> 01:00:30.140
<v Speaker 4>Now you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1115
01:00:30.141 --> 01:00:31.430
<v Speaker 4>well isn't creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1116
01:00:31.431 --> 01:00:33.470
<v Speaker 4>necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the answer to that is absolutely,</v>

1117
01:00:33.471 --> 01:00:36.830
<v Speaker 4>but it's not that useful when you're at </v>
<v Speaker 4>the bottom because who the hell wants to</v>

1118
01:00:36.831 --> 01:00:39.350
<v Speaker 4>hear your damn creative ideas when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're just starting out?</v>

1119
01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:42.080
<v Speaker 4>You know you're just a pain in the neck </v>
<v Speaker 4>even if you're right,</v>

1120
01:00:42.110 --> 01:00:45.200
<v Speaker 4>even if you're brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're just a pain in the neck if you're</v>

1121
01:00:45.201 --> 01:00:48.410
<v Speaker 4>creative at the bottom because you come </v>
<v Speaker 4>up with all these radical ideas that are</v>

1122
01:00:48.411 --> 01:00:51.350
<v Speaker 4>going to shape out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shake up the structure of the hierarchy,</v>

1123
01:00:51.590 --> 01:00:52.423
<v Speaker 4>and plus you haven't what indicated your</v>
<v Speaker 4>credibility of demonstrated your </v>

1124
01:00:55.731 --> 01:00:57.200
<v Speaker 4>credibility to any great degree.</v>

1125
01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:00.230
<v Speaker 4>So people are going to just write you </v>
<v Speaker 4>off as a,</v>

1126
01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:01.573
<v Speaker 4>they'll just going to write you off </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's easier than taking you </v>

1127
01:01:02.901 --> 01:01:03.950
<v Speaker 4>seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

1128
01:01:03.951 --> 01:01:07.040
<v Speaker 4>the funny thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that as you climb up the hierarchy,</v>

1129
01:01:07.370 --> 01:01:08.203
<v Speaker 4>creativity becomes increasingly </v>
<v Speaker 4>necessary until when you're at the very </v>

1130
01:01:10.911 --> 01:01:12.470
<v Speaker 4>top,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's absolutely vital.</v>

1131
01:01:12.471 --> 01:01:15.380
<v Speaker 4>And many,</v>
<v Speaker 4>many companies suffer from the fact that</v>

1132
01:01:15.410 --> 01:01:16.670
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1133
01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:18.313
<v Speaker 4>would you say promote conscientious </v>
<v Speaker 4>people continually up the ladder and </v>

1134
01:01:21.741 --> 01:01:24.200
<v Speaker 4>then they end up at the top with no </v>
<v Speaker 4>creative people.</v>

1135
01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:25.093
<v Speaker 4>But it's hard for the creative people to</v>
<v Speaker 4>climb to the top because creativity </v>

1136
01:01:28.011 --> 01:01:31.850
<v Speaker 4>isn't one of those things that ratchets </v>
<v Speaker 4>you up a hierarchy of competence.</v>

1137
01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:32.893
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so there are efficient on the </v>

1138
01:01:34.071 --> 01:01:34.904
<v Speaker 4>conscientious end and efficient on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligent and but creativity is a </v>

1139
01:01:38.301 --> 01:01:39.134
<v Speaker 4>whole different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean partly because how the hell do </v>

1140
01:01:41.691 --> 01:01:44.990
<v Speaker 4>you evaluate a creative person?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't by definition,</v>

1141
01:01:44.991 --> 01:01:45.824
<v Speaker 4>because to have a structure of </v>
<v Speaker 4>devaluation means that something has to </v>

1142
01:01:49.221 --> 01:01:51.440
<v Speaker 4>be done in a tried and true and </v>
<v Speaker 4>measurable manner.</v>

1143
01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:53.290
<v Speaker 4>And that is what a creative person does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He like,</v>

1144
01:01:53.310 --> 01:01:54.950
<v Speaker 4>they make a left turn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1145
01:01:54.990 --> 01:01:56.690
<v Speaker 4>90 degree turn and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1146
01:01:56.810 --> 01:01:58.520
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to do it completely </v>
<v Speaker 4>differently.</v>

1147
01:01:58.521 --> 01:01:59.910
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well how are you?</v>

1148
01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:00.793
<v Speaker 4>How is someone going to evaluate you if </v>
<v Speaker 4>you do that now you might be right and </v>

1149
01:02:03.950 --> 01:02:04.783
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>creative people are often wrong but </v>

1150
01:02:06.621 --> 01:02:09.680
<v Speaker 4>sometimes and vitally dead right when no</v>
<v Speaker 4>one else's.</v>

1151
01:02:09.710 --> 01:02:12.290
<v Speaker 4>But it's a really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really problematic.</v>

1152
01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:14.000
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're a creative person,</v>

1153
01:02:14.001 --> 01:02:14.834
<v Speaker 4>you're your best bet I would say is to </v>
<v Speaker 4>discipline yourself and ground yourself </v>

1154
01:02:18.231 --> 01:02:19.064
<v Speaker 4>in something relatively practical that </v>
<v Speaker 4>will enable you to eek out some sort of </v>

1155
01:02:22.411 --> 01:02:23.244
<v Speaker 4>living.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then to practice your creative </v>

1156
01:02:24.961 --> 01:02:27.000
<v Speaker 4>endeavor on the side,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can head,</v>

1157
01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:27.853
<v Speaker 4>ha ha,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can head to head long into it and </v>

1158
01:02:29.101 --> 01:02:31.050
<v Speaker 4>try to make money and be creative at the</v>
<v Speaker 4>same time.</v>

1159
01:02:31.051 --> 01:02:32.100
<v Speaker 4>But I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

1160
01:02:32.110 --> 01:02:32.943
<v Speaker 4>my experience has taught me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is a lot of experience and a </v>

1161
01:02:34.951 --> 01:02:37.320
<v Speaker 4>lot of watching and it's not something </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm happy to say,</v>

1162
01:02:37.321 --> 01:02:39.060
<v Speaker 4>is that it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>

1163
01:02:39.061 --> 01:02:39.894
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very difficult for creative people to </v>

1164
01:02:41.131 --> 01:02:42.420
<v Speaker 4>monetize their creativity.</v>

1165
01:02:42.420 --> 01:02:45.180
<v Speaker 4>And most of the time it's an exercise in</v>
<v Speaker 4>futility.</v>

1166
01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:46.313
<v Speaker 4>So what you have to do is stabilize </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself in some sort of productive and </v>

1167
01:02:49.321 --> 01:02:51.720
<v Speaker 4>traditional domain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>

1168
01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:52.793
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>use your extra time to work creatively </v>

1169
01:02:54.331 --> 01:02:56.670
<v Speaker 4>and see if you can branch out that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1170
01:02:56.671 --> 01:02:58.560
<v Speaker 4>you can always try to start a small </v>
<v Speaker 4>business to,</v>

1171
01:02:58.561 --> 01:03:00.450
<v Speaker 4>or even a big business.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But again,</v>

1172
01:03:00.451 --> 01:03:02.640
<v Speaker 4>not some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a high risk,</v>

1173
01:03:02.641 --> 01:03:04.320
<v Speaker 4>high return proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Yeah,</v>

1174
01:03:04.340 --> 01:03:06.990
<v Speaker 4>actually there's a technology that goes </v>
<v Speaker 4>along with that too.</v>

1175
01:03:06.991 --> 01:03:08.760
<v Speaker 4>You can't do that like a fool,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1176
01:03:08.761 --> 01:03:10.800
<v Speaker 4>you have to know what you're doing in </v>
<v Speaker 4>order to do that.</v>

1177
01:03:10.801 --> 01:03:12.060
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1178
01:03:14.310 --> 01:03:18.210
<v Speaker 4>what evil daddy will enslave the human </v>
<v Speaker 4>race come the eclipse.</v>

1179
01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:19.313
<v Speaker 4>I think that's probably the god Keck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That would be my guess as far as I'd </v>

1180
01:03:22.141 --> 01:03:23.280
<v Speaker 4>been able to tell us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So forth.</v>

1181
01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:24.413
<v Speaker 4>Could you please tell the difference </v>
<v Speaker 4>between equity and equality and why is </v>

1182
01:03:26.671 --> 01:03:27.750
<v Speaker 4>equity dangerous?</v>

1183
01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:29.880
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not actually equity and equality.</v>

1184
01:03:29.881 --> 01:03:32.730
<v Speaker 4>It's equity and equality of opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1185
01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:35.460
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a truism,</v>

1186
01:03:35.461 --> 01:03:38.790
<v Speaker 4>I think that's agreed upon by liberals </v>
<v Speaker 4>and conservatives alike,</v>

1187
01:03:39.090 --> 01:03:39.923
<v Speaker 4>that the interests of individuals and </v>
<v Speaker 4>society are best served by opening the </v>

1188
01:03:44.071 --> 01:03:49.071
<v Speaker 4>door to the participation of all who are</v>
<v Speaker 4>qualified regardless of their,</v>

1189
01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:50.273
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of attributes in domains that have </v>

1190
01:03:51.721 --> 01:03:54.060
<v Speaker 4>nothing to do with the qualifications </v>
<v Speaker 4>for the position.</v>

1191
01:03:54.090 --> 01:03:57.030
<v Speaker 4>So imagine that as a worker,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1192
01:03:57.330 --> 01:03:59.370
<v Speaker 4>and that would include managers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>executives,</v>

1193
01:03:59.371 --> 01:04:00.780
<v Speaker 4>et Cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As a worker,</v>

1194
01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:04.200
<v Speaker 4>you have a function like a tool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're a tool.</v>

1195
01:04:04.410 --> 01:04:05.243
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I wouldn't,</v>

1196
01:04:05.250 --> 01:04:08.610
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't be too down on that.</v>

1197
01:04:08.611 --> 01:04:11.920
<v Speaker 4>It's good to be good for something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

1198
01:04:13.290 --> 01:04:14.123
<v Speaker 4>we W W it's in society's best interest </v>
<v Speaker 4>that those who are able to be the most </v>

1199
01:04:17.791 --> 01:04:20.280
<v Speaker 4>efficient tools are the ones that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>placed in the position.</v>

1200
01:04:20.281 --> 01:04:24.510
<v Speaker 4>And so you want to open up the </v>
<v Speaker 4>competitive landscape to all players,</v>

1201
01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:25.553
<v Speaker 4>not least so that society can most </v>
<v Speaker 4>effectively exploit the people who are </v>

1202
01:04:28.831 --> 01:04:29.610
<v Speaker 4>most productive.</v>

1203
01:04:29.610 --> 01:04:30.443
<v Speaker 4>Now it also has the side benefit of </v>
<v Speaker 4>allowing individuals to utilize their </v>

1204
01:04:33.301 --> 01:04:35.460
<v Speaker 4>talents and to take their place in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>social world.</v>

1205
01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:39.180
<v Speaker 4>But people are very diverse in their </v>
<v Speaker 4>abilities,</v>

1206
01:04:39.181 --> 01:04:42.570
<v Speaker 4>like incredibly diverse in their </v>
<v Speaker 4>abilities and that's mostly evidence for</v>

1207
01:04:42.571 --> 01:04:44.310
<v Speaker 4>example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the domain of intelligence,</v>

1208
01:04:44.311 --> 01:04:46.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because while the,</v>

1209
01:04:46.130 --> 01:04:46.963
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the range that includes the majority of </v>

1210
01:04:48.451 --> 01:04:52.260
<v Speaker 4>people runs from an Iq of about 85 or </v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say 72,</v>

1211
01:04:52.261 --> 01:04:53.094
<v Speaker 4>an Iq of 130,</v>
<v Speaker 4>although there's plenty of people who </v>

1212
01:04:55.051 --> 01:05:00.000
<v Speaker 4>are outside those domains is like at 70,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're pretty intellectually impaired,</v>

1213
01:05:00.001 --> 01:05:00.834
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to graduate from high </v>

1214
01:05:01.651 --> 01:05:04.430
<v Speaker 4>school with an Iq of 70,</v>
<v Speaker 4>except under very,</v>

1215
01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:08.160
<v Speaker 4>very extreme circumstances with an Iq of</v>
<v Speaker 4>83,</v>

1216
01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:12.150
<v Speaker 4>which is about 10% of the population,</v>
<v Speaker 4>85 is 15%.</v>

1217
01:05:12.420 --> 01:05:16.770
<v Speaker 4>You're going to have a hard time reading</v>
<v Speaker 4>well enough to follow instructions it on</v>

1218
01:05:16.771 --> 01:05:18.250
<v Speaker 4>with an Iq of 115.</v>

1219
01:05:18.250 --> 01:05:19.790
<v Speaker 4>You're going to do pretty well at uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1220
01:05:19.860 --> 01:05:20.693
<v Speaker 4>sort of mid level community college.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so an Iq of 145 is going to prepare </v>

1221
01:05:25.031 --> 01:05:27.430
<v Speaker 4>you for like high success and complex </v>
<v Speaker 4>domain,</v>

1222
01:05:27.431 --> 01:05:28.264
<v Speaker 4>say like law or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or managerial positions where the </v>

1223
01:05:30.941 --> 01:05:32.980
<v Speaker 4>environment is transforming very </v>
<v Speaker 4>radically.</v>

1224
01:05:33.190 --> 01:05:38.190
<v Speaker 4>There is immense differences between </v>
<v Speaker 4>people in their cognitive ability and so</v>

1225
01:05:38.650 --> 01:05:39.483
<v Speaker 4>and in their conscientiousness and in </v>
<v Speaker 4>their negative emotionality and all and </v>

1226
01:05:43.121 --> 01:05:43.954
<v Speaker 4>in their energy levels and oh and in </v>
<v Speaker 4>their creativity and all sorts of </v>

1227
01:05:46.421 --> 01:05:48.450
<v Speaker 4>traits.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And because of that,</v>

1228
01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:49.433
<v Speaker 4>that individual diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no reason to assume that there </v>

1229
01:05:53.081 --> 01:05:56.200
<v Speaker 4>is going to be equality of outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's what equity is.</v>

1230
01:05:57.070 --> 01:05:58.660
<v Speaker 4>I've got to change the battery in my </v>
<v Speaker 4>camera</v>

1231
01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:37.730
<v Speaker 3>and we're back.</v>

1232
01:06:46.910 --> 01:06:51.230
<v Speaker 4>Apologies for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>With this Dlsr Dslr,</v>

1233
01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:53.240
<v Speaker 4>whichever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1234
01:06:53.450 --> 01:06:56.060
<v Speaker 4>there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I won't go into it.</v>

1235
01:06:56.510 --> 01:06:59.870
<v Speaker 4>I have to change the battery boat about </v>
<v Speaker 4>after about an hour or so.</v>

1236
01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:02.120
<v Speaker 4>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>back to intelligence.</v>

1237
01:07:02.150 --> 01:07:04.250
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what was I saying?</v>

1238
01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:16.800
<v Speaker 4>Talking about individual differences and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the differences.</v>

1239
01:07:16.801 --> 01:07:18.840
<v Speaker 4>Differences in intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

1240
01:07:18.841 --> 01:07:20.700
<v Speaker 4>Equality of outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1241
01:07:22.620 --> 01:07:26.430
<v Speaker 4>the only way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>given the wide range of human capacity,</v>

1242
01:07:26.950 --> 01:07:27.783
<v Speaker 3>mmm.</v>

1243
01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:31.790
<v Speaker 4>First step for you don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1244
01:07:32.330 --> 01:07:33.830
<v Speaker 4>organize your society</v>

1245
01:07:36.380 --> 01:07:37.213
<v Speaker 4>such that every single category of </v>
<v Speaker 4>outcome has exactly proportional </v>

1246
01:07:40.851 --> 01:07:44.780
<v Speaker 4>representation from every single </v>
<v Speaker 4>possible category of person.</v>

1247
01:07:45.260 --> 01:07:46.093
<v Speaker 4>Because that isn't you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to use so much social force in </v>

1248
01:07:50.571 --> 01:07:53.540
<v Speaker 4>order to make that occur.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That the consequences,</v>

1249
01:07:53.541 --> 01:07:56.090
<v Speaker 4>the negative consequences will far </v>
<v Speaker 4>outweigh the benefits.</v>

1250
01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:57.073
<v Speaker 4>It's better to open up the marketplace </v>
<v Speaker 4>to allow a very large range of </v>

1251
01:08:00.951 --> 01:08:05.951
<v Speaker 4>hierarchies to emerge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then to let people compete for their</v>

1252
01:08:06.980 --> 01:08:09.890
<v Speaker 4>position to compete and cooperate for </v>
<v Speaker 4>their own positions.</v>

1253
01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:13.400
<v Speaker 4>And the other problem with equity is </v>
<v Speaker 4>like who the hell is going to make the,</v>

1254
01:08:13.460 --> 01:08:16.010
<v Speaker 4>who's going to decide which groups are </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be categorized?</v>

1255
01:08:16.310 --> 01:08:18.110
<v Speaker 4>You want to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's an example for you.</v>

1256
01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:20.990
<v Speaker 4>Let's imagine you stratify the </v>
<v Speaker 4>population by Iq,</v>

1257
01:08:21.020 --> 01:08:22.460
<v Speaker 4>which,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which we do by the way.</v>

1258
01:08:22.461 --> 01:08:25.280
<v Speaker 4>Although,</v>
<v Speaker 4>although we don't do it as evidently and</v>

1259
01:08:25.281 --> 01:08:29.090
<v Speaker 4>obviously as we do say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>buy sex or perhaps even by race,</v>

1260
01:08:29.730 --> 01:08:30.563
<v Speaker 4>are you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>would you actually recommend that an </v>

1261
01:08:32.180 --> 01:08:36.290
<v Speaker 4>equal number of people be drawn from </v>
<v Speaker 4>every category of Iq to be surgeons?</v>

1262
01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:38.150
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's palpably absurd.</v>

1263
01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:39.313
<v Speaker 4>So there's too much social engineering </v>
<v Speaker 4>required to produce equity of outcome </v>

1264
01:08:43.581 --> 01:08:44.211
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1265
01:08:44.211 --> 01:08:46.520
<v Speaker 4>having said that as well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1266
01:08:46.980 --> 01:08:47.791
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1267
01:08:47.791 --> 01:08:50.630
<v Speaker 4>the historical data on equity are </v>
<v Speaker 4>absolute declare.</v>

1268
01:08:50.631 --> 01:08:51.464
<v Speaker 4>The societies that have tried to aim at </v>
<v Speaker 4>equity are the terrible communistic </v>

1269
01:08:54.501 --> 01:08:55.334
<v Speaker 4>societies of the 20th century and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>were so goddamn ma so unbelievably </v>

1270
01:09:01.460 --> 01:09:02.293
<v Speaker 4>murderous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And counterproductive that it beggars </v>

1271
01:09:04.911 --> 01:09:05.744
<v Speaker 4>the imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I can't even believe we have a </v>

1272
01:09:07.191 --> 01:09:10.310
<v Speaker 4>conversation about equity because it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>such a pathological idea.</v>

1273
01:09:10.311 --> 01:09:11.144
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's completely invalidated by the </v>

1274
01:09:12.471 --> 01:09:14.210
<v Speaker 4>historical data.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1275
01:09:14.930 --> 01:09:15.763
<v Speaker 4>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does my average daily schedule </v>

1276
01:09:17.511 --> 01:09:18.680
<v Speaker 4>consist of?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1277
01:09:18.681 --> 01:09:19.514
<v Speaker 4>that's fairly straight forward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get up around somewhere between six </v>

1278
01:09:22.191 --> 01:09:23.024
<v Speaker 4>and eight and then I work till 10 as,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as hard as I can flat out every single </v>

1279
01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:29.301
<v Speaker 4>day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1280
01:09:29.301 --> 01:09:32.960
<v Speaker 4>and I've been doing that for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with very little variation,</v>

1281
01:09:32.990 --> 01:09:35.780
<v Speaker 4>although it's been much more extreme in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the last year for like,</v>

1282
01:09:35.781 --> 01:09:38.510
<v Speaker 4>since 1985,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I work probably,</v>

1283
01:09:39.290 --> 01:09:41.960
<v Speaker 4>well I work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say 14 hours a day,</v>

1284
01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:44.600
<v Speaker 4>at least 14 hours a day.</v>

1285
01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:49.160
<v Speaker 4>And so that said about a hundred hours a</v>
<v Speaker 4>week and that time that I don't do that,</v>

1286
01:09:49.161 --> 01:09:52.790
<v Speaker 4>I spend with friends and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but mostly with my family.</v>

1287
01:09:53.210 --> 01:09:54.140
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1288
01:09:54.770 --> 01:09:55.603
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I work as efficiently as I possibly </v>

1289
01:09:57.531 --> 01:10:00.170
<v Speaker 4>can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm always trying to do everything I can</v>

1290
01:10:00.171 --> 01:10:01.004
<v Speaker 4>as fast as I possibly can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm accustomed to that because like </v>

1291
01:10:03.771 --> 01:10:04.910
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been doing it for,</v>

1292
01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:09.050
<v Speaker 4>I've been doing it for 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's my daily schedule.</v>

1293
01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:12.350
<v Speaker 4>And I don't know even what I would do if</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't do that.</v>

1294
01:10:12.390 --> 01:10:14.840
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have this cottage that I go to,</v>

1295
01:10:14.841 --> 01:10:15.674
<v Speaker 4>although I generally spend time writing </v>
<v Speaker 4>up there and I go swimming with my wife </v>

1296
01:10:18.381 --> 01:10:22.700
<v Speaker 4>and we go canoeing and I can take a </v>
<v Speaker 4>break in that way.</v>

1297
01:10:22.970 --> 01:10:26.330
<v Speaker 4>But most of the time if I take a break </v>
<v Speaker 4>even up at the cottage,</v>

1298
01:10:26.331 --> 01:10:29.030
<v Speaker 4>generally what I do is like carpentry </v>
<v Speaker 4>and fix the place up.</v>

1299
01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:29.863
<v Speaker 4>And I don't like to be unoccupied.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have to be occupied doing something </v>

1300
01:10:33.620 --> 01:10:38.330
<v Speaker 4>productive all the time because </v>
<v Speaker 4>otherwise I'm not pleased with myself.</v>

1301
01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:39.410
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1302
01:10:39.411 --> 01:10:40.244
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I decided a long time ago that I was </v>

1303
01:10:41.301 --> 01:10:43.910
<v Speaker 4>going to try to live a hyper efficient </v>
<v Speaker 4>and hyper productive life.</v>

1304
01:10:43.911 --> 01:10:45.780
<v Speaker 4>And so it's been a challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1305
01:10:45.860 --> 01:10:46.693
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's an enjoyable thing for me to some </v>

1306
01:10:47.661 --> 01:10:48.494
<v Speaker 4>degree because I'm very interested in </v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to figure out how much I can </v>

1307
01:10:51.321 --> 01:10:53.120
<v Speaker 4>possibly do in the shortest period of </v>
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>

1308
01:10:53.121 --> 01:10:53.954
<v Speaker 4>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that keeps you alert and awake and </v>

1309
01:10:56.301 --> 01:10:59.690
<v Speaker 4>it's a great challenge and it lends my </v>
<v Speaker 4>life a substantial amount of meaning and</v>

1310
01:10:59.691 --> 01:11:01.160
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's been very successful.</v>

1311
01:11:01.161 --> 01:11:02.210
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1312
01:11:02.660 --> 01:11:04.370
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that's kind of what it's like.</v>

1313
01:11:05.930 --> 01:11:06.501
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

1314
01:11:06.501 --> 01:11:08.720
<v Speaker 4>Let's see what else these chat people </v>
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>

1315
01:11:09.350 --> 01:11:13.040
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh wow.</v>

1316
01:11:13.110 --> 01:11:13.943
<v Speaker 4>Apparently.</v>

1317
01:11:14.580 --> 01:11:14.880
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1318
01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:17.670
<v Speaker 4>Broken mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In tolstoy's confession,</v>

1319
01:11:17.671 --> 01:11:18.504
<v Speaker 4>he talks about meaning in faith.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had many problems with religion and </v>

1320
01:11:21.211 --> 01:11:22.044
<v Speaker 4>the church.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How can a nonreligious person find a </v>

1321
01:11:23.791 --> 01:11:26.520
<v Speaker 4>meaningful nonreligious faith?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1322
01:11:26.521 --> 01:11:27.630
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1323
01:11:27.631 --> 01:11:29.640
<v Speaker 4>it depends on what you mean by </v>
<v Speaker 4>nonreligious.</v>

1324
01:11:30.090 --> 01:11:32.100
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say for broken mind,</v>

1325
01:11:32.490 --> 01:11:33.323
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1326
01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:36.360
<v Speaker 4>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was thinking about this today.</v>

1327
01:11:36.361 --> 01:11:37.194
<v Speaker 4>I was writing about this today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was reading about Dostoyevsky as </v>

1328
01:11:38.761 --> 01:11:39.810
<v Speaker 4>compared to Nicha,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1329
01:11:39.811 --> 01:11:43.440
<v Speaker 4>and nature was a great critic of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Christianity and so as Dostoyevsky,</v>

1330
01:11:43.830 --> 01:11:44.663
<v Speaker 4>but dusty Yefsky I think trumped Nicha </v>
<v Speaker 4>with regards to his attitude towards </v>

1331
01:11:48.630 --> 01:11:50.490
<v Speaker 4>Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think you could really see this.</v>

1332
01:11:50.491 --> 01:11:54.810
<v Speaker 4>He could read the brothers [inaudible] I</v>
<v Speaker 4>would really recommend that broken mind.</v>

1333
01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:56.790
<v Speaker 4>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Get your hands on Dostoevsky,</v>

1334
01:11:56.791 --> 01:12:00.420
<v Speaker 4>read everything you can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He wrote cause Dostoyevsky re really and</v>

1335
01:12:00.421 --> 01:12:02.130
<v Speaker 4>you like tolstoy's confession,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1336
01:12:02.250 --> 01:12:04.260
<v Speaker 4>read Dostoyevsky.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

1337
01:12:04.261 --> 01:12:07.130
<v Speaker 4>Dostoyevsky has this character in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>brothers Karamazov um,</v>

1338
01:12:07.380 --> 01:12:08.213
<v Speaker 4>Alioscha</v>

1339
01:12:08.750 --> 01:12:09.583
<v Speaker 4>and Osha is a monastic novitiate and </v>
<v Speaker 4>who's kind of a naive guy </v>

1340
01:12:13.641 --> 01:12:15.410
<v Speaker 4>intellectually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>although very good person.</v>

1341
01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:18.410
<v Speaker 4>I'm a simple person intellectually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>

1342
01:12:18.411 --> 01:12:21.140
<v Speaker 4>perhaps not naive and he has this older </v>
<v Speaker 4>brother Ivan,</v>

1343
01:12:21.141 --> 01:12:24.770
<v Speaker 4>who is a devastating intellect and a </v>
<v Speaker 4>handsome man and a rake with a women and</v>

1344
01:12:24.771 --> 01:12:25.570
<v Speaker 4>like really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1345
01:12:25.570 --> 01:12:26.403
<v Speaker 4>like a well put together human being.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Although quite nihilistic and cutting </v>

1346
01:12:29.121 --> 01:12:29.954
<v Speaker 4>and his intellect and Ivan can </v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely demolish Ellie Osha in a </v>

1347
01:12:34.700 --> 01:12:35.533
<v Speaker 4>debate and does quite regularly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But Ellie Osha basically wins the </v>

1348
01:12:38.691 --> 01:12:39.524
<v Speaker 4>argument in the book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say as the book plays itself out </v>

1349
01:12:41.660 --> 01:12:44.750
<v Speaker 4>by acting like a good person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I would say,</v>

1350
01:12:45.310 --> 01:12:47.720
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you want to develop a religious faith</v>

1351
01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:48.583
<v Speaker 4>in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>forget about trying to develop faith in </v>

1352
01:12:50.601 --> 01:12:53.180
<v Speaker 4>God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you can will yourself into</v>

1353
01:12:53.181 --> 01:12:54.710
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not even sure that you should,</v>

1354
01:12:55.010 --> 01:12:55.843
<v Speaker 4>but I do think that you can decide that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to do what you can to live </v>

1355
01:13:00.531 --> 01:13:04.100
<v Speaker 4>a meaningful life and be a good person </v>
<v Speaker 4>and start to meditate on what that means</v>

1356
01:13:04.101 --> 01:13:05.720
<v Speaker 4>and then to start to put it in practice.</v>

1357
01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:06.553
<v Speaker 4>And then you find your religious faith </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the domain of action rather than </v>

1358
01:13:08.751 --> 01:13:09.584
<v Speaker 4>conceptualization.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's really the primary domain in </v>

1359
01:13:11.931 --> 01:13:14.120
<v Speaker 4>which it should be manifested anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the,</v>

1360
01:13:14.180 --> 01:13:16.490
<v Speaker 4>the primary Christian commitment for </v>
<v Speaker 4>example,</v>

1361
01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:20.780
<v Speaker 4>is the imitation of Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not the belief in his divinity,</v>

1362
01:13:20.781 --> 01:13:21.614
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or the belief that he died for the sins </v>

1363
01:13:22.731 --> 01:13:25.250
<v Speaker 4>of mankind or any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm not making light of that.</v>

1364
01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:26.473
<v Speaker 4>But the primary moral injunction is to </v>
<v Speaker 4>try to live the archetipal life within </v>

1365
01:13:30.951 --> 01:13:32.990
<v Speaker 4>the confines of your own subjective </v>
<v Speaker 4>being,</v>

1366
01:13:32.991 --> 01:13:36.200
<v Speaker 4>to try to live the most divine life that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can.</v>

1367
01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:37.393
<v Speaker 4>And if you try that and if you take that</v>
<v Speaker 4>seriously and if you meditate upon that </v>

1368
01:13:40.401 --> 01:13:41.234
<v Speaker 4>and ask yourself what it might mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I think you'll find the religious </v>

1369
01:13:44.241 --> 01:13:46.940
<v Speaker 4>element of your life fleshing itself out</v>
<v Speaker 4>quite nicely.</v>

1370
01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:52.300
<v Speaker 4>So that's the answer to that question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thoughts on the drug epidemic?</v>

1371
01:13:56.840 --> 01:13:57.673
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure there is an epidemic any </v>

1372
01:13:59.020 --> 01:13:59.853
<v Speaker 4>more than there always has been.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know that there is now a tilt towards </v>

1373
01:14:04.491 --> 01:14:08.570
<v Speaker 4>drugs in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the u s in particular like meth and,</v>

1374
01:14:08.690 --> 01:14:09.570
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1375
01:14:09.770 --> 01:14:12.400
<v Speaker 4>fentanyl and the other opiates.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now it's quite a catastrophe.</v>

1376
01:14:12.780 --> 01:14:13.613
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1377
01:14:16.500 --> 01:14:20.970
<v Speaker 4>a lot of that is occurring among people </v>
<v Speaker 4>who don't have meaning in their lives.</v>

1378
01:14:20.971 --> 01:14:23.280
<v Speaker 4>I would say you might think that's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>fast I'll answer,</v>

1379
01:14:23.281 --> 01:14:24.180
<v Speaker 4>but it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1380
01:14:24.181 --> 01:14:25.800
<v Speaker 4>like here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's the wrap literature.</v>

1381
01:14:25.801 --> 01:14:28.140
<v Speaker 4>Like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you take a rat lab rat,</v>

1382
01:14:28.590 --> 01:14:30.180
<v Speaker 4>typical lab rat is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1383
01:14:30.300 --> 01:14:35.300
<v Speaker 4>genetically bred to be identical with </v>
<v Speaker 4>many other lab routes and he lives alone</v>

1384
01:14:36.721 --> 01:14:37.554
<v Speaker 4>in a cage and he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's got a pretty miserable route life </v>

1385
01:14:40.321 --> 01:14:41.154
<v Speaker 4>because routes are social animals and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't like to live in cages by </v>

1386
01:14:43.291 --> 01:14:44.124
<v Speaker 4>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you can get a lab rat in a cage </v>

1387
01:14:45.661 --> 01:14:47.790
<v Speaker 4>addicted to cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cocaine and no time flat.</v>

1388
01:14:47.791 --> 01:14:48.624
<v Speaker 4>And he'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he'll like press a lever for cocaine </v>

1389
01:14:50.881 --> 01:14:51.714
<v Speaker 4>reward to pretty much to the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the exclusion of all else including </v>

1390
01:14:55.261 --> 01:14:56.094
<v Speaker 4>sex and often including food.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you take that same rat and you </v>

1391
01:14:59.311 --> 01:15:01.500
<v Speaker 4>put them in a rat family,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1392
01:15:01.501 --> 01:15:02.334
<v Speaker 4>in a rat social hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a rat environment and give him </v>

1393
01:15:04.411 --> 01:15:08.010
<v Speaker 4>something that rat rat like to do so </v>
<v Speaker 4>that he can be satisfied,</v>

1394
01:15:08.130 --> 01:15:10.500
<v Speaker 4>it's very difficult to get them addicted</v>
<v Speaker 4>to cocaine.</v>

1395
01:15:10.860 --> 01:15:11.693
<v Speaker 4>And so I would say the reason that </v>
<v Speaker 4>people take psychomotor stimulants and </v>

1396
01:15:13.921 --> 01:15:14.754
<v Speaker 4>all the drugs have serious abuse or </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychomotor stimulants regardless of </v>

1397
01:15:17.671 --> 01:15:20.670
<v Speaker 4>what else they might be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they activate the dopaminergic system,</v>

1398
01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:25.440
<v Speaker 4>which is the system that tracks reward </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that that is associated,</v>

1399
01:15:25.441 --> 01:15:28.830
<v Speaker 4>that's activated when you pursue velop </v>
<v Speaker 4>valuable goal directed behavior.</v>

1400
01:15:29.340 --> 01:15:30.930
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you don't have that,</v>

1401
01:15:30.931 --> 01:15:33.640
<v Speaker 4>if you don't have a valid goal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you don't have no,</v>

1402
01:15:33.710 --> 01:15:36.690
<v Speaker 4>no real valid meaning in your life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't have a valid ambition,</v>

1403
01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:39.690
<v Speaker 4>then you don't have any way of </v>
<v Speaker 4>activating that system.</v>

1404
01:15:39.691 --> 01:15:41.340
<v Speaker 4>And why the hell wouldn't you take </v>
<v Speaker 4>drugs?</v>

1405
01:15:41.550 --> 01:15:45.960
<v Speaker 4>It's like you have to have something </v>
<v Speaker 4>better to do to not addict yourself,</v>

1406
01:15:46.050 --> 01:15:46.883
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

1407
01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:50.540
<v Speaker 4>so I would say that a huge part of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>current epidemic in,</v>

1408
01:15:50.541 --> 01:15:52.410
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the u s in particular is,</v>

1409
01:15:52.650 --> 01:15:57.650
<v Speaker 4>is manifest among broken men who have no</v>
<v Speaker 4>real place in society and providing them</v>

1410
01:15:57.721 --> 01:15:58.554
<v Speaker 4>with money isn't going to help that they</v>
<v Speaker 4>need a productive and meaningful </v>

1411
01:16:00.541 --> 01:16:02.880
<v Speaker 4>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And which is the paramount,</v>

1412
01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:06.270
<v Speaker 4>the paramount goal should be the </v>
<v Speaker 4>paramount goal of social,</v>

1413
01:16:06.780 --> 01:16:08.890
<v Speaker 4>of social policy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For example,</v>

1414
01:16:08.891 --> 01:16:09.350
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

1415
01:16:09.350 --> 01:16:10.183
<v Speaker 4>it isn't the alleviation of poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's really the issue because people </v>

1416
01:16:12.721 --> 01:16:13.554
<v Speaker 4>in the West aren't poor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There might be a bit of a distribution </v>

1417
01:16:15.451 --> 01:16:16.620
<v Speaker 4>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we're not poor.</v>

1418
01:16:16.980 --> 01:16:19.680
<v Speaker 4>What we have is a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1419
01:16:20.310 --> 01:16:21.510
<v Speaker 4>what would you say?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

1420
01:16:22.350 --> 01:16:23.183
<v Speaker 4>we have a problem of meaningful </v>
<v Speaker 4>engagement and that's what has to be </v>

1421
01:16:25.891 --> 01:16:27.990
<v Speaker 4>addressed and that's why I do the work </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I'm doing.</v>

1422
01:16:28.410 --> 01:16:29.243
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

1423
01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:32.233
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1424
01:16:32.370 --> 01:16:33.203
<v Speaker 4>Are you aware of the similarities in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>work of Anthony Robbins and with lot of </v>

1425
01:16:35.761 --> 01:16:37.590
<v Speaker 4>what you are doing in the self authoring</v>
<v Speaker 4>suite?</v>

1426
01:16:37.940 --> 01:16:38.773
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not specifically aware of the </v>

1427
01:16:39.961 --> 01:16:40.794
<v Speaker 4>similarities,</v>
<v Speaker 4>although I know that Anthony Robbins is </v>

1428
01:16:42.301 --> 01:16:43.134
<v Speaker 4>a well known motivational speaker and </v>
<v Speaker 4>generally motivational speakers try to </v>

1429
01:16:46.801 --> 01:16:49.560
<v Speaker 4>motivate people to pursue something </v>
<v Speaker 4>productive in their life.</v>

1430
01:16:49.860 --> 01:16:50.700
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1431
01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:51.953
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say likely that there are </v>

1432
01:16:54.180 --> 01:16:55.170
<v Speaker 4>motivational.</v>

1433
01:16:55.920 --> 01:16:56.420
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1434
01:16:56.420 --> 01:16:59.550
<v Speaker 4>There are people who are concerned with </v>
<v Speaker 4>motivation that are working at different</v>

1435
01:16:59.551 --> 01:17:00.384
<v Speaker 4>levels of the communication strata.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm working at a fairly abstract </v>

1436
01:17:03.571 --> 01:17:08.571
<v Speaker 4>level and hopefully Mr Robinson's </v>
<v Speaker 4>working at a level that is productive,</v>

1437
01:17:09.260 --> 01:17:10.093
<v Speaker 4>helpful to lots of people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He certainly had a very stable and long </v>

1438
01:17:11.841 --> 01:17:12.674
<v Speaker 4>career.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1439
01:17:13.020 --> 01:17:13.853
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>although I'm not aware of any specific </v>

1440
01:17:15.231 --> 01:17:17.510
<v Speaker 4>similarities past that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

1441
01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:26.040
<v Speaker 4>what do you think about Adhd?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have it,</v>

1442
01:17:26.041 --> 01:17:28.510
<v Speaker 4>I am frustrated by my failures in life </v>
<v Speaker 4>because of it.</v>

1443
01:17:28.540 --> 01:17:31.600
<v Speaker 4>I am trying to become a cam a chemist </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I am failing at school.</v>

1444
01:17:32.350 --> 01:17:36.370
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think adhd is a catch all diagnosis.</v>

1445
01:17:36.371 --> 01:17:40.930
<v Speaker 4>I think that people who are extroverted </v>
<v Speaker 4>and unconscientious for example,</v>

1446
01:17:40.931 --> 01:17:43.330
<v Speaker 4>often manifest the traits of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

1447
01:17:43.540 --> 01:17:45.250
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>attention deficit disorder.</v>

1448
01:17:45.730 --> 01:17:46.563
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know that there isn't any real </v>

1449
01:17:47.981 --> 01:17:51.730
<v Speaker 4>evidence of longterm utility and cycle </v>
<v Speaker 4>and cycle.</v>

1450
01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:54.790
<v Speaker 4>What a psycho pharmacological treatment </v>
<v Speaker 4>for Adhd.</v>

1451
01:17:55.150 --> 01:17:56.410
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say though,</v>

1452
01:17:56.411 --> 01:17:59.740
<v Speaker 4>if you are having a hard time </v>
<v Speaker 4>concentrating on your goals,</v>

1453
01:17:59.980 --> 01:18:03.160
<v Speaker 4>that what you should probably do is set </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself up with a therapist,</v>

1454
01:18:03.161 --> 01:18:04.660
<v Speaker 4>find someone you can talk to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1455
01:18:04.661 --> 01:18:07.120
<v Speaker 4>so see two or three therapists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know it's expensive,</v>

1456
01:18:07.121 --> 01:18:07.954
<v Speaker 4>but so is not having a life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Find someone you can talk to and then </v>

1457
01:18:11.261 --> 01:18:14.410
<v Speaker 4>make it and someone practical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably a behavioral therapist would be</v>

1458
01:18:14.411 --> 01:18:15.130
<v Speaker 4>best.</v>

1459
01:18:15.130 --> 01:18:20.080
<v Speaker 4>And then have them set goals with you </v>
<v Speaker 4>and help you strategize to stay on track</v>

1460
01:18:20.081 --> 01:18:21.820
<v Speaker 4>week to week.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the best thing.</v>

1461
01:18:21.821 --> 01:18:24.610
<v Speaker 4>Or to set that up with a friend if he </v>
<v Speaker 4>can't do it with the therapist.</v>

1462
01:18:24.611 --> 01:18:28.390
<v Speaker 4>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the best advice I have for that.</v>

1463
01:18:28.391 --> 01:18:29.530
<v Speaker 4>And keep at it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1464
01:18:29.860 --> 01:18:32.350
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but break your,</v>

1465
01:18:32.380 --> 01:18:35.710
<v Speaker 4>you gotta learn to schedule.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got to learn to break your days down</v>

1466
01:18:35.711 --> 01:18:36.544
<v Speaker 4>into disciplined sub sections and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>got to practice out at and practice at </v>

1467
01:18:40.271 --> 01:18:41.104
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there isn't an easier answer that I </v>

1468
01:18:42.761 --> 01:18:43.594
<v Speaker 4>know of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But having someone that will help keep </v>

1469
01:18:45.431 --> 01:18:47.200
<v Speaker 4>your responsible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think can be useful.</v>

1470
01:18:47.201 --> 01:18:51.040
<v Speaker 4>I've seen that be useful for people who </v>
<v Speaker 4>have attention deficit disorder.</v>

1471
01:18:51.041 --> 01:18:51.874
<v Speaker 4>Let's say</v>

1472
01:18:56.840 --> 01:18:57.673
<v Speaker 4>you compare at once compared religion </v>
<v Speaker 4>and science as tools that can be used </v>

1473
01:19:00.321 --> 01:19:02.330
<v Speaker 4>more accurately to understand your </v>
<v Speaker 4>position.</v>

1474
01:19:02.660 --> 01:19:06.920
<v Speaker 4>Do you think gender and biological sex </v>
<v Speaker 4>are two tools in describing an identity?</v>

1475
01:19:07.670 --> 01:19:08.503
<v Speaker 4>Not really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that most of what I think most </v>

1476
01:19:11.091 --> 01:19:14.540
<v Speaker 4>of the work on gender is rubbish to put </v>
<v Speaker 4>it bluntly.</v>

1477
01:19:14.950 --> 01:19:17.510
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get what is meant by it.</v>

1478
01:19:17.511 --> 01:19:18.344
<v Speaker 4>You know that there is a socio cultural </v>
<v Speaker 4>layer specifying gendered behavior on </v>

1479
01:19:21.771 --> 01:19:22.604
<v Speaker 4>top of biological sexual identity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think it's been so polluted by </v>

1480
01:19:25.761 --> 01:19:28.730
<v Speaker 4>political idiocy that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a concept.</v>

1481
01:19:28.731 --> 01:19:32.660
<v Speaker 4>It's almost entirely invalidated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's used for perverse purposes.</v>

1482
01:19:32.661 --> 01:19:35.600
<v Speaker 4>It's not used as a tool of understanding</v>
<v Speaker 4>in most situations.</v>

1483
01:19:35.930 --> 01:19:36.960
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1484
01:19:37.010 --> 01:19:37.843
<v Speaker 4>I think that the concept of gender could</v>
<v Speaker 4>be useful if it was used to specify the </v>

1485
01:19:42.871 --> 01:19:47.570
<v Speaker 4>purely socio cultural layer of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of like sex type behavior.</v>

1486
01:19:47.690 --> 01:19:50.030
<v Speaker 4>And I think it could conceivably be used</v>
<v Speaker 4>in that way.</v>

1487
01:19:50.031 --> 01:19:52.250
<v Speaker 4>But I see very little evidence that it </v>
<v Speaker 4>ever is.</v>

1488
01:19:52.610 --> 01:19:53.443
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1489
01:19:55.630 --> 01:19:56.040
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1490
01:19:56.040 --> 01:19:59.340
<v Speaker 4>My brother is a soldier in Iraq as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>clinical psychologist.</v>

1491
01:19:59.430 --> 01:20:00.263
<v Speaker 4>What should one do when coming from such</v>
<v Speaker 4>a chaotic place back to a tame and </v>

1492
01:20:03.181 --> 01:20:05.130
<v Speaker 4>structured one?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1493
01:20:05.131 --> 01:20:09.030
<v Speaker 4>I guess that would depend to some degree</v>
<v Speaker 4>on exactly the nature of his experiences</v>

1494
01:20:09.031 --> 01:20:10.450
<v Speaker 4>in Iraq.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1495
01:20:10.620 --> 01:20:13.620
<v Speaker 4>so it's hard for me to elaborate on that</v>
<v Speaker 4>further.</v>

1496
01:20:13.860 --> 01:20:16.650
<v Speaker 4>I mean I would say though that one thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>he could really do,</v>

1497
01:20:16.651 --> 01:20:17.484
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is somewhat self serving I or </v>

1498
01:20:19.051 --> 01:20:19.884
<v Speaker 4>could appear to be somewhat self serving</v>
<v Speaker 4>I suppose is I would strongly recommend </v>

1499
01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:23.993
<v Speaker 4>that your brother do the self authoring </v>
<v Speaker 4>suite when he comes back because it'll </v>

1500
01:20:27.210 --> 01:20:28.043
<v Speaker 4>help him and probably concentrated on </v>
<v Speaker 4>the future authoring program to begin </v>

1501
01:20:31.081 --> 01:20:33.930
<v Speaker 4>with because it might take a while when </v>
<v Speaker 4>he gets back,</v>

1502
01:20:33.931 --> 01:20:34.764
<v Speaker 4>before he can meditate on his </v>
<v Speaker 4>experiences without that meditation </v>

1503
01:20:38.871 --> 01:20:40.610
<v Speaker 4>being harmful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So for example,</v>

1504
01:20:40.790 --> 01:20:41.623
<v Speaker 4>there's pretty good evidence if you've </v>
<v Speaker 4>had a traumatic experience that you </v>

1505
01:20:43.701 --> 01:20:44.534
<v Speaker 4>shouldn't re subject yourself to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>traumatic experience repeatedly before </v>

1506
01:20:49.431 --> 01:20:52.160
<v Speaker 4>say about 18 months or something like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that is past.</v>

1507
01:20:52.370 --> 01:20:54.860
<v Speaker 4>And it isn't exactly obvious why that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>the case,</v>

1508
01:20:54.861 --> 01:20:57.170
<v Speaker 4>but there's a pretty good literature </v>
<v Speaker 4>indicating that it is.</v>

1509
01:20:57.410 --> 01:20:58.243
<v Speaker 4>So I would say that when he makes the </v>
<v Speaker 4>transition from Iraq back to enormous </v>

1510
01:21:02.100 --> 01:21:02.933
<v Speaker 4>normative society,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the first thing you should do is </v>

1511
01:21:04.131 --> 01:21:05.210
<v Speaker 4>generate a plan.</v>

1512
01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:05.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1513
01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:06.793
<v Speaker 4>And our plan about how we would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this would be the same even if you </v>

1514
01:21:08.921 --> 01:21:10.600
<v Speaker 4>were coming out of something like prison</v>
<v Speaker 4>or,</v>

1515
01:21:10.780 --> 01:21:14.050
<v Speaker 4>or making a change,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a radical change in your occupation,</v>

1516
01:21:14.051 --> 01:21:15.710
<v Speaker 4>is you need a plan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1517
01:21:15.730 --> 01:21:16.563
<v Speaker 4>You need a plan so that you can fake </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you can't just make that </v>

1518
01:21:19.631 --> 01:21:21.310
<v Speaker 4>adjustment without knowing what you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing.</v>

1519
01:21:21.550 --> 01:21:24.580
<v Speaker 4>So that's what I would recommend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if he does come back traumatized,</v>

1520
01:21:24.581 --> 01:21:26.200
<v Speaker 4>and I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1521
01:21:26.201 --> 01:21:27.034
<v Speaker 4>traumatic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>traumatized soldiers often have to </v>

1522
01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:31.590
<v Speaker 4>develop a very comprehensive philosophy </v>
<v Speaker 4>of good and evil.</v>

1523
01:21:31.591 --> 01:21:32.424
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so that would either mean perhaps </v>

1524
01:21:33.731 --> 01:21:34.564
<v Speaker 4>talking to a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a decent clinical psychologist about </v>

1525
01:21:36.641 --> 01:21:40.480
<v Speaker 4>what his experiences were or perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 4>reading some of the literature.</v>

1526
01:21:40.481 --> 01:21:41.314
<v Speaker 4>And I've outlined those books on my </v>
<v Speaker 4>website@jordanbpeterson.com that can be </v>

1527
01:21:44.291 --> 01:21:45.124
<v Speaker 4>really helpful in understanding and </v>
<v Speaker 4>helping someone understand the evils of </v>

1528
01:21:48.821 --> 01:21:52.390
<v Speaker 4>atrocity and warfare didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And even the necessary evils,</v>

1529
01:21:52.391 --> 01:21:54.010
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of atrocity and warfare.</v>

1530
01:21:54.370 --> 01:21:59.370
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1531
01:22:01.441 --> 01:22:02.274
<v Speaker 4>let's see here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think a lot of your work is the </v>

1532
01:22:05.431 --> 01:22:10.431
<v Speaker 4>form of the bargaining stage of grief?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1533
01:22:12.490 --> 01:22:13.323
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that there's these stages </v>

1534
01:22:15.011 --> 01:22:16.870
<v Speaker 4>of grief that had been identified.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1535
01:22:17.530 --> 01:22:19.100
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember who did the work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1536
01:22:19.350 --> 01:22:20.130
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

1537
01:22:20.130 --> 01:22:22.510
<v Speaker 4>it seems to have been quite helpful work</v>
<v Speaker 4>for many people.</v>

1538
01:22:22.700 --> 01:22:23.533
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1539
01:22:25.030 --> 01:22:30.030
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I'm bargaining exactly.</v>

1540
01:22:30.580 --> 01:22:32.860
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I'm suggesting that people</v>
<v Speaker 4>bargain.</v>

1541
01:22:32.861 --> 01:22:35.680
<v Speaker 4>I think I'm suggesting that people work </v>
<v Speaker 4>in sacrificing,</v>

1542
01:22:36.100 --> 01:22:37.530
<v Speaker 4>you could think about that as </v>
<v Speaker 4>bargaining.</v>

1543
01:22:37.990 --> 01:22:40.750
<v Speaker 4>Bargaining has the connotation more of </v>
<v Speaker 4>pleading.</v>

1544
01:22:41.290 --> 01:22:41.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1545
01:22:41.530 --> 01:22:42.363
<v Speaker 4>Well let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I don't think that work and </v>

1546
01:22:44.071 --> 01:22:46.130
<v Speaker 4>sacrifice constitute pleading.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1547
01:22:46.140 --> 01:22:46.973
<v Speaker 4>I think that they're actually really </v>
<v Speaker 4>effective means of dealing with the </v>

1548
01:22:49.291 --> 01:22:50.124
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that people can be highly </v>

1549
01:22:51.091 --> 01:22:53.340
<v Speaker 4>effective and competent much more than </v>
<v Speaker 4>they think.</v>

1550
01:22:53.850 --> 01:22:54.683
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1551
01:22:55.110 --> 01:22:57.630
<v Speaker 4>it's an interesting question and I can </v>
<v Speaker 4>see why you posed it,</v>

1552
01:22:57.631 --> 01:22:57.961
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1553
01:22:57.961 --> 01:22:59.430
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't believe it.</v>

1554
01:22:59.670 --> 01:23:00.503
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1555
01:23:01.020 --> 01:23:01.853
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1556
01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:02.833
<v Speaker 4>Could you comment on the Buddhist </v>
<v Speaker 4>concept of impermanence and the nature </v>

1557
01:23:06.071 --> 01:23:08.710
<v Speaker 4>of reality being given,</v>
<v Speaker 4>being what gives it meaning?</v>

1558
01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:10.360
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a good one.</v>

1559
01:23:11.110 --> 01:23:14.260
<v Speaker 4>And how that concept conflicts with </v>
<v Speaker 4>ideas of eternal life in heaven.</v>

1560
01:23:14.290 --> 01:23:15.123
<v Speaker 4>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

1561
01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:17.650
<v Speaker 4>that's a lot of questions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a lot of hard questions.</v>

1562
01:23:17.980 --> 01:23:20.910
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whoa.</v>

1563
01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:24.370
<v Speaker 4>Let's start with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to only answer one of those.</v>

1564
01:23:24.371 --> 01:23:27.940
<v Speaker 4>I think it's just too much effort to get</v>
<v Speaker 4>all three of them in the same.</v>

1565
01:23:28.060 --> 01:23:31.630
<v Speaker 4>It's like hitting three fast balls with </v>
<v Speaker 4>the same swing of the bat.</v>

1566
01:23:31.631 --> 01:23:32.740
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I can manage it.</v>

1567
01:23:34.750 --> 01:23:38.710
<v Speaker 4>How does the finite nature of reality </v>
<v Speaker 4>give it?</v>

1568
01:23:38.711 --> 01:23:39.544
<v Speaker 4>Meaning?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How is it that the finite nature of </v>

1569
01:23:41.111 --> 01:23:43.120
<v Speaker 4>reality is what gives it meaning?</v>
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

1570
01:23:43.121 --> 01:23:45.340
<v Speaker 4>that's such a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1571
01:23:46.060 --> 01:23:47.590
<v Speaker 4>I can answer this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1572
01:23:47.591 --> 01:23:48.424
<v Speaker 4>Bleakley I'm going to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 4>something that happened to the comic </v>

1573
01:23:51.161 --> 01:23:51.994
<v Speaker 4>book character Superman in the late </v>
<v Speaker 4>seventies so superman was </v>

1574
01:23:55.720 --> 01:23:56.553
<v Speaker 4>extraordinarily popular from the 1930s </v>
<v Speaker 4>right up to the 1970s but one of the </v>

1575
01:24:00.971 --> 01:24:03.760
<v Speaker 4>things that happened is that as he </v>
<v Speaker 4>became more and more popular,</v>

1576
01:24:03.761 --> 01:24:06.040
<v Speaker 4>he also got more and more powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1577
01:24:06.041 --> 01:24:08.140
<v Speaker 4>So by the 80s Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1578
01:24:08.141 --> 01:24:11.080
<v Speaker 4>you could bounce a hydrogen bomb off </v>
<v Speaker 4>superman's chest and he could,</v>

1579
01:24:11.170 --> 01:24:14.620
<v Speaker 4>he could juggle planets and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's all well and good.</v>

1580
01:24:14.621 --> 01:24:15.454
<v Speaker 4>Except what are you going to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what kind of adventure is he going to </v>

1581
01:24:17.171 --> 01:24:18.130
<v Speaker 4>have?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1582
01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:19.570
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1583
01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:22.870
<v Speaker 4>if you can't blow them up with an a </v>
<v Speaker 4>hydrogen bomb and he can juggle planets,</v>

1584
01:24:23.140 --> 01:24:25.450
<v Speaker 4>nothing interesting can happen to him.</v>

1585
01:24:25.630 --> 01:24:26.463
<v Speaker 4>He can be anywhere he wants at any time </v>
<v Speaker 4>and he can do anything he wants with no </v>

1586
01:24:29.561 --> 01:24:31.220
<v Speaker 4>effort at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at,</v>

1587
01:24:31.221 --> 01:24:31.930
<v Speaker 4>at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at,</v>

1588
01:24:31.930 --> 01:24:35.200
<v Speaker 4>at an under any circumstances </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatsoever.</v>

1589
01:24:35.201 --> 01:24:38.800
<v Speaker 4>So he's like a permanent deus ex ex </v>
<v Speaker 4>Makena.</v>

1590
01:24:38.801 --> 01:24:39.634
<v Speaker 4>I think I've got that right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is superman is boring because God </v>

1591
01:24:43.271 --> 01:24:47.050
<v Speaker 4>always comes in at this last moment and </v>
<v Speaker 4>saves him from whatever predicament he's</v>

1592
01:24:47.051 --> 01:24:48.190
<v Speaker 4>in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1593
01:24:48.490 --> 01:24:52.180
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>contemplating that perversely enough can</v>

1594
01:24:52.181 --> 01:24:54.820
<v Speaker 4>give you some appreciation for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>finitude of life.</v>

1595
01:24:54.821 --> 01:24:58.510
<v Speaker 4>It's like we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're like infinity captured in,</v>

1596
01:24:58.690 --> 01:24:59.800
<v Speaker 4>in the finite,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1597
01:24:59.801 --> 01:25:02.620
<v Speaker 4>like a genie and capsulated in the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the lamp,</v>

1598
01:25:02.621 --> 01:25:03.520
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and genius,</v>

1599
01:25:03.550 --> 01:25:07.240
<v Speaker 4>the gene root word of genius by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's not an accidental comparison.</v>

1600
01:25:07.780 --> 01:25:08.613
<v Speaker 4>And it's this strange combination of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of infinite capacity that characterized </v>

1601
01:25:13.700 --> 01:25:14.533
<v Speaker 4>as human beings to some degree with this</v>
<v Speaker 4>terrible finite limitation that does in </v>

1602
01:25:17.651 --> 01:25:20.530
<v Speaker 4>fact make our lives the adventures that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they are.</v>

1603
01:25:20.770 --> 01:25:24.130
<v Speaker 4>And so this is quite nicely documented </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the Tao Te Ching,</v>

1604
01:25:24.131 --> 01:25:25.900
<v Speaker 4>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I would really recommend,</v>

1605
01:25:25.901 --> 01:25:26.734
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1606
01:25:26.860 --> 01:25:29.380
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the translation by Seth Rosenthal.</v>

1607
01:25:29.381 --> 01:25:32.320
<v Speaker 4>I already think it's elegant and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>the Taoists are very good at,</v>

1608
01:25:32.380 --> 01:25:33.213
<v Speaker 4>at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at,</v>

1609
01:25:33.250 --> 01:25:36.450
<v Speaker 4>at formulating the utility of </v>
<v Speaker 4>nonexistence.</v>

1610
01:25:36.460 --> 01:25:37.293
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's actually a verse in the </v>

1611
01:25:39.250 --> 01:25:41.800
<v Speaker 4>Tao Te Ching called the utility of </v>
<v Speaker 4>nonexistence where they talk about the,</v>

1612
01:25:42.190 --> 01:25:44.310
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the empty space in a part,</v>

1613
01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:46.510
<v Speaker 4>giving it its utility and the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1614
01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:47.353
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that's what the pot isn't in some </v>

1615
01:25:50.171 --> 01:25:51.780
<v Speaker 4>sense that makes it what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1616
01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:52.913
<v Speaker 4>and that's also the case with human </v>
<v Speaker 4>beings is that we have these intense </v>

1617
01:25:55.481 --> 01:25:56.314
<v Speaker 4>limitations that we can then attempt to </v>
<v Speaker 4>transcend and that it's meaningful to </v>

1618
01:26:01.631 --> 01:26:04.310
<v Speaker 4>transcend those limitations in such an </v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting way.</v>

1619
01:26:04.311 --> 01:26:07.250
<v Speaker 4>And I don't know what that means in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>final metaphysical analysis,</v>

1620
01:26:07.730 --> 01:26:10.640
<v Speaker 4>but you see that we do this voluntarily </v>
<v Speaker 4>to ourselves too,</v>

1621
01:26:10.641 --> 01:26:11.474
<v Speaker 4>because board people will place </v>
<v Speaker 4>restrictions on themselves just for </v>

1622
01:26:15.651 --> 01:26:16.250
<v Speaker 4>entertainment.</v>

1623
01:26:16.250 --> 01:26:18.260
<v Speaker 4>That's exactly what we do when we play a</v>
<v Speaker 4>game.</v>

1624
01:26:18.261 --> 01:26:19.190
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

1625
01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:20.713
<v Speaker 4>if you're playing chess,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you subject yourself to all sorts of </v>

1626
01:26:22.341 --> 01:26:24.080
<v Speaker 4>arbitrary limitations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1627
01:26:24.081 --> 01:26:24.914
<v Speaker 4>There's only a certain number of things </v>
<v Speaker 4>you can do with the chessboard and the </v>

1628
01:26:26.631 --> 01:26:29.030
<v Speaker 4>chest chessmen and then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1629
01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:30.673
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you open up a whole universe of </v>

1630
01:26:32.751 --> 01:26:35.330
<v Speaker 4>possibilities by adopting those </v>
<v Speaker 4>limitations.</v>

1631
01:26:35.331 --> 01:26:36.164
<v Speaker 4>And there's something about that that </v>
<v Speaker 4>speaks deeply to the absolute nature of </v>

1632
01:26:38.541 --> 01:26:43.340
<v Speaker 4>reality and maybe justifies the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the tragic finitude of being.</v>

1633
01:26:43.341 --> 01:26:44.460
<v Speaker 4>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1634
01:26:44.490 --> 01:26:46.250
<v Speaker 4>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's how it looks to me.</v>

1635
01:26:46.251 --> 01:26:47.690
<v Speaker 4>And I've thought about that quite </v>
<v Speaker 4>deeply.</v>

1636
01:26:47.691 --> 01:26:48.524
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

1637
01:26:51.790 --> 01:26:55.650
<v Speaker 4>can an introvert thrive in the field of </v>
<v Speaker 4>law or should they avoid it altogether?</v>

1638
01:26:55.800 --> 01:26:57.440
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually we,</v>

1639
01:26:57.480 --> 01:27:00.690
<v Speaker 4>we gathered a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of data on lawyers and,</v>

1640
01:27:00.730 --> 01:27:03.300
<v Speaker 4>and extroversion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't predict law.</v>

1641
01:27:03.630 --> 01:27:05.550
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what would you say proficiency at law at</v>

1642
01:27:05.551 --> 01:27:08.730
<v Speaker 4>all?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not associated with it at all.</v>

1643
01:27:09.140 --> 01:27:11.490
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what predicts proficiency in law,</v>

1644
01:27:11.491 --> 01:27:16.170
<v Speaker 4>his intelligence and conscientiousness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then after that,</v>

1645
01:27:16.200 --> 01:27:19.350
<v Speaker 4>relatively low agreeableness because </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a very competitive enterprise,</v>

1646
01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:22.770
<v Speaker 4>high emotional stability.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So low neuroticism,</v>

1647
01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:25.350
<v Speaker 4>but introverted lawyers do fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

1648
01:27:25.500 --> 01:27:28.710
<v Speaker 4>if you're an introverted lawyer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's going to be some challenges.</v>

1649
01:27:29.340 --> 01:27:33.330
<v Speaker 4>And those challenges would be developing</v>
<v Speaker 4>the social skills necessary,</v>

1650
01:27:33.331 --> 01:27:34.164
<v Speaker 4>say to stand up in the courtroom if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>happen to be a lawyer who's going to do </v>

1651
01:27:36.550 --> 01:27:40.410
<v Speaker 4>courtroom work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's plenty of like solitary work</v>

1652
01:27:40.411 --> 01:27:41.244
<v Speaker 4>that a lawyer can engage in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then the other problem might be for </v>

1653
01:27:43.861 --> 01:27:44.694
<v Speaker 4>an introverted lawyer that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to develop your web of </v>

1654
01:27:47.401 --> 01:27:49.170
<v Speaker 4>connections,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your social network,</v>

1655
01:27:49.171 --> 01:27:51.030
<v Speaker 4>and of course you want to do that in any</v>
<v Speaker 4>enterprise,</v>

1656
01:27:51.031 --> 01:27:51.270
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1657
01:27:51.270 --> 01:27:53.430
<v Speaker 4>So it's a challenge for introverts in </v>
<v Speaker 4>general.</v>

1658
01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:54.473
<v Speaker 4>But I would say there's absolutely no </v>
<v Speaker 4>reason whatsoever to assume that law is </v>

1659
01:27:57.751 --> 01:27:59.550
<v Speaker 4>a discipline that an introvert should </v>
<v Speaker 4>avoid.</v>

1660
01:27:59.730 --> 01:28:00.361
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1661
01:28:00.361 --> 01:28:02.820
<v Speaker 4>go for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you need to be conscientious,</v>

1662
01:28:02.821 --> 01:28:03.560
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause low.</v>

1663
01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:06.840
<v Speaker 4>It really matters if you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>conscientious as a lawyer and you should</v>

1664
01:28:06.841 --> 01:28:07.674
<v Speaker 4>have a pretty decent verbal intelligence</v>
<v Speaker 4>because otherwise it's going to be a </v>

1665
01:28:09.631 --> 01:28:10.464
<v Speaker 4>hard road because the lawyers have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>deal with an awful lot of verbal </v>

1666
01:28:13.171 --> 01:28:15.510
<v Speaker 4>material and they have to formulate </v>
<v Speaker 4>complex arguments.</v>

1667
01:28:15.511 --> 01:28:17.190
<v Speaker 4>They have to be able to write and </v>
<v Speaker 4>communicate.</v>

1668
01:28:17.191 --> 01:28:18.420
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1669
01:28:18.450 --> 01:28:19.283
<v Speaker 4>you got it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want to think about those elements </v>

1670
01:28:20.281 --> 01:28:21.810
<v Speaker 4>of your temperament more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say.</v>

1671
01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:28.913
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1672
01:28:29.020 --> 01:28:29.853
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1673
01:28:30.410 --> 01:28:30.700
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1674
01:28:30.700 --> 01:28:33.330
<v Speaker 4>Dr. Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you believe the evidence for God lies</v>

1675
01:28:33.331 --> 01:28:35.200
<v Speaker 4>primarily inner inner,</v>
<v Speaker 4>inner,</v>

1676
01:28:35.290 --> 01:28:37.170
<v Speaker 4>inner personal experiences?</v>

1677
01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:46.473
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1678
01:28:48.620 --> 01:28:49.060
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

1679
01:28:49.060 --> 01:28:53.000
<v Speaker 4>it lies to a great degree in </v>
<v Speaker 4>interpersonal experiences,</v>

1680
01:28:53.001 --> 01:28:56.540
<v Speaker 4>although I don't even know if you could </v>
<v Speaker 4>call that necessarily evidence for God.</v>

1681
01:28:56.780 --> 01:28:59.300
<v Speaker 4>It depends on what you're willing to </v>
<v Speaker 4>accept as evidence.</v>

1682
01:28:59.301 --> 01:29:02.060
<v Speaker 4>Like even that experience that I had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1683
01:29:02.550 --> 01:29:07.440
<v Speaker 4>that I described earlier in the q and a </v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't evidence for the existence of God.</v>

1684
01:29:07.470 --> 01:29:08.251
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

1685
01:29:08.251 --> 01:29:12.090
<v Speaker 4>it was certainly a religious experience </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I found it extremely,</v>

1686
01:29:12.091 --> 01:29:14.610
<v Speaker 4>extremely compelling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But from a scientific perspective,</v>

1687
01:29:14.611 --> 01:29:17.460
<v Speaker 4>it's almost worthless as evidence </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's purely subjective.</v>

1688
01:29:17.730 --> 01:29:20.100
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there are elements of experience</v>

1689
01:29:20.101 --> 01:29:20.934
<v Speaker 4>that cannot be God at objectively.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I'm willing to take subjective </v>

1690
01:29:24.061 --> 01:29:24.894
<v Speaker 4>experience under some circumstances as </v>
<v Speaker 4>evidence in so far as if I have a </v>

1691
01:29:28.051 --> 01:29:30.090
<v Speaker 4>subjective experience that I find </v>
<v Speaker 4>credible,</v>

1692
01:29:30.270 --> 01:29:33.210
<v Speaker 4>I'm willing to act on what I believe to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be its meaning.</v>

1693
01:29:33.510 --> 01:29:37.410
<v Speaker 4>And so I'll test out my interpretation </v>
<v Speaker 4>of that experience pragmatically.</v>

1694
01:29:37.620 --> 01:29:40.410
<v Speaker 4>And that's good enough for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm willing to consider that evidence,</v>

1695
01:29:40.411 --> 01:29:42.720
<v Speaker 4>but you can't really consider that </v>
<v Speaker 4>scientific evidence.</v>

1696
01:29:43.050 --> 01:29:44.820
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1697
01:29:47.700 --> 01:29:49.920
<v Speaker 4>but then what other evidence is there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1698
01:29:49.921 --> 01:29:50.754
<v Speaker 4>there's also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's call it the evidence that's </v>

1699
01:29:52.740 --> 01:29:55.560
<v Speaker 4>instantiated in the great religious </v>
<v Speaker 4>texts of mankind,</v>

1700
01:29:55.561 --> 01:29:58.380
<v Speaker 4>the great philosophical texts and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>great literary text as well.</v>

1701
01:29:58.381 --> 01:30:02.430
<v Speaker 4>And I wouldn't exactly call that </v>
<v Speaker 4>subjective experience because you can,</v>

1702
01:30:02.760 --> 01:30:05.390
<v Speaker 4>you can garner it through your exposure </v>
<v Speaker 4>to culture and,</v>

1703
01:30:05.670 --> 01:30:06.503
<v Speaker 4>but you know whether or not that </v>
<v Speaker 4>constitutes evidence depends on what </v>

1704
01:30:09.301 --> 01:30:12.390
<v Speaker 4>you're willing to define as and accept </v>
<v Speaker 4>as evidence.</v>

1705
01:30:12.660 --> 01:30:13.493
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

1706
01:30:21.160 --> 01:30:23.800
<v Speaker 4>I'm told that my overanalyzing is double</v>
<v Speaker 4>edged sword,</v>

1707
01:30:23.830 --> 01:30:25.750
<v Speaker 4>but I'm suffering from being this way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1708
01:30:25.751 --> 01:30:27.610
<v Speaker 4>well you're probably,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1709
01:30:27.700 --> 01:30:30.550
<v Speaker 4>hi and openness and maybe you're very </v>
<v Speaker 4>verbally intelligence,</v>

1710
01:30:30.551 --> 01:30:31.384
<v Speaker 4>so you're pretty much stuck with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you've got a bit of mania to you </v>

1711
01:30:33.491 --> 01:30:34.324
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I don't mean that in a negative </v>

1712
01:30:35.351 --> 01:30:37.870
<v Speaker 4>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I find relief when I drink alcohol,</v>

1713
01:30:37.871 --> 01:30:41.110
<v Speaker 4>smoke or take certain drugs because it </v>
<v Speaker 4>slows down my thought process.</v>

1714
01:30:41.350 --> 01:30:43.750
<v Speaker 4>How can I use my over analysis to my </v>
<v Speaker 4>advantage?</v>

1715
01:30:43.990 --> 01:30:44.823
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say find yourself a difficult </v>

1716
01:30:45.971 --> 01:30:47.890
<v Speaker 4>cognitive problem to solve.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1717
01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:49.630
<v Speaker 4>pick a challenge,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pick a challenge.</v>

1718
01:30:49.631 --> 01:30:51.730
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you also might consider,</v>

1719
01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:56.560
<v Speaker 4>you might consider talking to someone </v>
<v Speaker 4>you find relief when you drink alcohol.</v>

1720
01:30:56.680 --> 01:30:59.620
<v Speaker 4>That might be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that might be an indication that some of</v>

1721
01:30:59.621 --> 01:31:04.060
<v Speaker 4>what you're overanalyzing isn't so much </v>
<v Speaker 4>a consequence of access cognitive power,</v>

1722
01:31:04.061 --> 01:31:06.280
<v Speaker 4>but an excessive of high negative </v>
<v Speaker 4>emotion.</v>

1723
01:31:06.670 --> 01:31:10.210
<v Speaker 4>And so that would be illustrated in say </v>
<v Speaker 4>high trait neuroticism.</v>

1724
01:31:10.570 --> 01:31:11.403
<v Speaker 4>We're going to release the big five </v>
<v Speaker 4>aspects scale here later this month and </v>

1725
01:31:13.930 --> 01:31:14.763
<v Speaker 4>you'll be able to take that and it'll </v>
<v Speaker 4>give you a pretty good detailed </v>

1726
01:31:16.990 --> 01:31:17.823
<v Speaker 4>description of your personality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's two dimensions of </v>

1727
01:31:19.691 --> 01:31:21.760
<v Speaker 4>neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>withdrawal and volatility.</v>

1728
01:31:21.761 --> 01:31:25.600
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're overanalyzing because you're,</v>

1729
01:31:25.660 --> 01:31:27.580
<v Speaker 4>you're um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you call that?</v>

1730
01:31:28.270 --> 01:31:32.230
<v Speaker 4>Ruminating that can be a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 4>high levels of anxiety.</v>

1731
01:31:32.231 --> 01:31:33.064
<v Speaker 4>And the reason I'm suggesting that is </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you said you find relief when </v>

1732
01:31:35.441 --> 01:31:36.274
<v Speaker 4>you drink alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And alcohol is a very powerful and </v>

1733
01:31:37.870 --> 01:31:40.210
<v Speaker 4>anxiety lytic agent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>antianxiety agent.</v>

1734
01:31:40.570 --> 01:31:41.403
<v Speaker 4>And so lots of people who have high </v>
<v Speaker 4>levels of anxiety do ruminate and so </v>

1735
01:31:44.741 --> 01:31:46.180
<v Speaker 4>overanalyze,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say.</v>

1736
01:31:46.420 --> 01:31:50.150
<v Speaker 4>And they find relief when they drink </v>
<v Speaker 4>because alcohol is a primary anxiety.</v>

1737
01:31:50.151 --> 01:31:52.140
<v Speaker 4>Lytic like valium,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like Benzodiazepines,</v>

1738
01:31:52.220 --> 01:31:53.053
<v Speaker 4>barbiturates.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the fact that alcohol gives you </v>

1739
01:31:55.631 --> 01:31:56.464
<v Speaker 4>relief probably indicates that some of </v>
<v Speaker 4>what's driving your overanalysis is </v>

1740
01:31:59.831 --> 01:32:04.690
<v Speaker 4>anxiety and then you could exercise can </v>
<v Speaker 4>really help with that.</v>

1741
01:32:04.840 --> 01:32:05.673
<v Speaker 4>I would also recommend,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is something we need to think </v>

1742
01:32:07.091 --> 01:32:08.620
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what your eating habits are</v>

1743
01:32:08.621 --> 01:32:09.454
<v Speaker 4>like are your sleeping habits.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you are an anxious person and </v>

1744
01:32:11.801 --> 01:32:15.040
<v Speaker 4>that's manifesting itself in say </v>
<v Speaker 4>neurotic over analysis,</v>

1745
01:32:15.220 --> 01:32:17.080
<v Speaker 4>there's two things you can do very </v>
<v Speaker 4>rapidly.</v>

1746
01:32:17.110 --> 01:32:19.390
<v Speaker 4>Three things really that will help quell</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1747
01:32:19.710 --> 01:32:22.150
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well for things even number one,</v>

1748
01:32:22.860 --> 01:32:23.150
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1749
01:32:23.150 --> 01:32:23.983
<v Speaker 4>get up at the same time everyday and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>would recommend in the morning cause </v>

1750
01:32:26.391 --> 01:32:27.224
<v Speaker 4>that's when people generally get up and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's good to do what everyone else does </v>

1751
01:32:29.511 --> 01:32:31.040
<v Speaker 4>is nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have a good reason not to.</v>

1752
01:32:31.550 --> 01:32:34.760
<v Speaker 4>Number two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eat a large breakfast,</v>

1753
01:32:35.180 --> 01:32:37.340
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Keep it carbohydrate light,</v>

1754
01:32:37.370 --> 01:32:38.203
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't,</v>

1755
01:32:38.210 --> 01:32:40.450
<v Speaker 4>don't eat toast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>toast and like uh,</v>

1756
01:32:40.700 --> 01:32:42.500
<v Speaker 4>fruit loops.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not going to do the trick.</v>

1757
01:32:42.740 --> 01:32:46.040
<v Speaker 4>Make it fat and protein heavy and eat </v>
<v Speaker 4>more than you want.</v>

1758
01:32:46.041 --> 01:32:47.550
<v Speaker 4>You might say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not hungry in the mornings.</v>

1759
01:32:47.580 --> 01:32:51.410
<v Speaker 4>Like this has nothing to do with what </v>
<v Speaker 4>you want or what your appetite is.</v>

1760
01:32:51.411 --> 01:32:53.150
<v Speaker 4>It's like you need to eat in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>morning.</v>

1761
01:32:53.630 --> 01:32:54.463
<v Speaker 4>If you're an anxious person and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't eat in the morning and then you </v>

1762
01:32:57.621 --> 01:33:00.230
<v Speaker 4>stress yourself out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your body hyper produces insulin,</v>

1763
01:33:00.231 --> 01:33:01.064
<v Speaker 4>it takes all the blood sugar out of your</v>
<v Speaker 4>blood and that disregulates your </v>

1764
01:33:04.281 --> 01:33:05.810
<v Speaker 4>metabolism for the entire day.</v>

1765
01:33:05.810 --> 01:33:07.730
<v Speaker 4>You can't reset it till you go to sleep </v>
<v Speaker 4>at night.</v>

1766
01:33:07.731 --> 01:33:08.564
<v Speaker 4>And I've had lots of anxious clients who</v>
<v Speaker 4>would say fall into the over analytic </v>

1767
01:33:11.751 --> 01:33:12.584
<v Speaker 4>category who were like virtually cured </v>
<v Speaker 4>by eating a large breakfast every </v>

1768
01:33:16.101 --> 01:33:16.934
<v Speaker 4>morning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would highly recommend that you could </v>

1769
01:33:18.291 --> 01:33:19.124
<v Speaker 4>try some physical exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Weightlifting is really good for curing </v>

1770
01:33:21.501 --> 01:33:23.390
<v Speaker 4>anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the other thing you could do,</v>

1771
01:33:23.391 --> 01:33:24.224
<v Speaker 4>as I alluded to earlier today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is to make a schedule and start </v>

1772
01:33:27.231 --> 01:33:30.980
<v Speaker 4>attending to your daily micro routines.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>

1773
01:33:30.981 --> 01:33:33.080
<v Speaker 4>you've got to figure out what your over </v>
<v Speaker 4>analysis is.</v>

1774
01:33:33.081 --> 01:33:37.250
<v Speaker 4>It might be cognitive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like maybe you have a very active mind,</v>

1775
01:33:37.251 --> 01:33:40.310
<v Speaker 4>you know you're fast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>verbally are you fast verbally.</v>

1776
01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:41.233
<v Speaker 4>One way you can find that out is to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>something like write down as many </v>

1777
01:33:43.491 --> 01:33:44.324
<v Speaker 4>letters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>words as you can that begin with the </v>

1778
01:33:46.011 --> 01:33:48.770
<v Speaker 4>letter s for example.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In in three minutes,</v>

1779
01:33:48.771 --> 01:33:49.604
<v Speaker 4>do that with a bunch of your friends.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you're someone who writes down </v>

1780
01:33:51.411 --> 01:33:52.244
<v Speaker 4>way more words than anyone else,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you're verbally fluent and that </v>

1781
01:33:55.011 --> 01:33:56.900
<v Speaker 4>might be driving some of your over </v>
<v Speaker 4>analysis.</v>

1782
01:33:56.901 --> 01:33:57.734
<v Speaker 4>But my guess is that you're suffering </v>
<v Speaker 4>from some rumination that's related to </v>

1783
01:34:01.791 --> 01:34:03.160
<v Speaker 4>anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I told,</v>

1784
01:34:03.230 --> 01:34:06.290
<v Speaker 4>told you what I think the simplest ways </v>
<v Speaker 4>aren't to rectify that.</v>

1785
01:34:06.740 --> 01:34:08.870
<v Speaker 4>So hope that works out for you.</v>

1786
01:34:10.820 --> 01:34:12.440
<v Speaker 4>Let's see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what else have we got here?</v>

1787
01:34:12.710 --> 01:34:17.710
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Alhmad warrior says,</v>

1788
01:34:24.601 --> 01:34:27.000
<v Speaker 4>can you answer this question,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dr. Peterson?</v>

1789
01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:30.840
<v Speaker 4>And the answer is I can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm not going to.</v>

1790
01:34:31.500 --> 01:34:33.060
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's see.</v>

1791
01:34:33.700 --> 01:34:34.533
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1792
01:34:40.180 --> 01:34:42.460
<v Speaker 4>Loki doodle says I cleaned my room </v>
<v Speaker 4>finally.</v>

1793
01:34:42.461 --> 01:34:45.400
<v Speaker 4>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hope that it has a pronounced positive</v>

1794
01:34:45.401 --> 01:34:46.234
<v Speaker 4>effect on the rest of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know it's funny because since last </v>

1795
01:34:49.720 --> 01:34:50.553
<v Speaker 4>September I would say I redid my house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to put a video online about </v>

1796
01:34:53.021 --> 01:34:53.854
<v Speaker 4>that cause I had a camera crew in here </v>
<v Speaker 4>this week videoing the whole house </v>

1797
01:34:56.471 --> 01:34:58.550
<v Speaker 4>because it's quite interesting I would </v>
<v Speaker 4>say.</v>

1798
01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:02.630
<v Speaker 4>But since I've stepped into this chaotic</v>
<v Speaker 4>domain last September,</v>

1799
01:35:02.810 --> 01:35:03.643
<v Speaker 4>my room has been a mess.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The rest of the house hasn't been too </v>

1800
01:35:05.301 --> 01:35:07.070
<v Speaker 4>bad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I've never got to cleaning my room.</v>

1801
01:35:07.071 --> 01:35:07.904
<v Speaker 4>I finally did this weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what was interesting because when I </v>

1802
01:35:10.281 --> 01:35:11.114
<v Speaker 4>did it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I've been doing a lot of other </v>

1803
01:35:12.441 --> 01:35:13.520
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's,</v>

1804
01:35:13.521 --> 01:35:14.330
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1805
01:35:14.330 --> 01:35:16.350
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't help.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1806
01:35:16.430 --> 01:35:17.263
<v Speaker 4>keep at bay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The negative psychological consequences </v>

1807
01:35:20.121 --> 01:35:21.710
<v Speaker 4>of being in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

1808
01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:25.100
<v Speaker 4>in material chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I cleaned my room this weekend,</v>

1809
01:35:25.101 --> 01:35:28.430
<v Speaker 4>it made it easier for me to finish this </v>
<v Speaker 4>chapter that I've been obsessing about.</v>

1810
01:35:28.431 --> 01:35:29.930
<v Speaker 4>So that was quite interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1811
01:35:30.290 --> 01:35:31.123
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cleaning and organizing your room is no </v>

1812
01:35:32.721 --> 01:35:34.700
<v Speaker 4>joke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a great meditative exercise,</v>

1813
01:35:34.701 --> 01:35:38.510
<v Speaker 4>especially if you take it seriously and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not trying to make it look neat.</v>

1814
01:35:38.750 --> 01:35:39.583
<v Speaker 4>Although that's not a bad aim.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're trying to turn the room into </v>

1815
01:35:41.391 --> 01:35:44.690
<v Speaker 4>somewhere that the person you want to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>could live.</v>

1816
01:35:45.170 --> 01:35:46.003
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

1817
01:35:51.040 --> 01:35:51.873
<v Speaker 4>what</v>

1818
01:35:59.380 --> 01:36:00.213
<v Speaker 4>do I believe that there was any </v>
<v Speaker 4>connection between leftist identity </v>

1819
01:36:02.261 --> 01:36:03.094
<v Speaker 4>politics of past decades in the emergent</v>
<v Speaker 4>white identity politics of the alt </v>

1820
01:36:05.751 --> 01:36:06.401
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

1821
01:36:06.401 --> 01:36:08.350
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a direct causal </v>
<v Speaker 4>connection.</v>

1822
01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:09.513
<v Speaker 4>It only stands to reason that if </v>
<v Speaker 4>identity politics is going to be the </v>

1823
01:36:13.661 --> 01:36:15.960
<v Speaker 4>acceptable mode of communication,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the,</v>

1824
01:36:16.130 --> 01:36:20.020
<v Speaker 4>that there are people who are on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>white side of the equation.</v>

1825
01:36:20.021 --> 01:36:20.854
<v Speaker 4>Let's say we're going to decide that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're going to play exactly the same </v>

1826
01:36:23.021 --> 01:36:24.100
<v Speaker 4>game,</v>
<v Speaker 4>clearly,</v>

1827
01:36:24.101 --> 01:36:25.600
<v Speaker 4>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1828
01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:27.240
<v Speaker 4>and horribly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1829
01:36:27.340 --> 01:36:28.173
<v Speaker 4>because I'm no fan of identity politics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what's sauce for the goose is sauce </v>

1830
01:36:31.661 --> 01:36:33.040
<v Speaker 4>for the Gander.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1831
01:36:33.041 --> 01:36:35.920
<v Speaker 4>but I would recommend that people don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>do it because you know,</v>

1832
01:36:35.921 --> 01:36:38.560
<v Speaker 4>the radical leftists and their damn </v>
<v Speaker 4>identity politics is,</v>

1833
01:36:38.561 --> 01:36:39.394
<v Speaker 4>that's unbelievably pathological.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you decided to fight that by </v>

1834
01:36:42.221 --> 01:36:43.720
<v Speaker 4>playing the same game,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you think,</v>

1835
01:36:43.721 --> 01:36:44.554
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll play the same game and then I'll </v>

1836
01:36:45.071 --> 01:36:45.340
<v Speaker 4>win.</v>

1837
01:36:45.340 --> 01:36:45.911
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1838
01:36:45.911 --> 01:36:48.970
<v Speaker 4>you won't because by playing the game </v>
<v Speaker 4>you lose.</v>

1839
01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:49.953
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing about your political </v>
<v Speaker 4>opponents is you don't play the damn </v>

1840
01:36:52.481 --> 01:36:54.310
<v Speaker 4>game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You play a different game.</v>

1841
01:36:54.760 --> 01:36:55.750
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1842
01:36:55.751 --> 01:36:56.584
<v Speaker 4>what I've been trying to encourage </v>
<v Speaker 4>people to do is instead of playing the </v>

1843
01:36:58.571 --> 01:36:59.404
<v Speaker 4>collectivist game,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that would include alt-right </v>

1844
01:37:01.060 --> 01:37:02.410
<v Speaker 4>identity politics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>

1845
01:37:02.670 --> 01:37:03.503
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is to play the individual's game and to </v>

1846
01:37:05.561 --> 01:37:07.930
<v Speaker 4>get their act together the best revenge </v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say,</v>

1847
01:37:08.050 --> 01:37:09.760
<v Speaker 4>but you shouldn't be doing it for </v>
<v Speaker 4>revenge.</v>

1848
01:37:09.790 --> 01:37:10.623
<v Speaker 4>But the best revenge against the </v>
<v Speaker 4>collective last of us collectivist </v>

1849
01:37:13.341 --> 01:37:14.174
<v Speaker 4>leftists is to live a stalwart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>meaningful and high quality individual </v>

1850
01:37:18.161 --> 01:37:18.994
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's also the pathway that </v>

1851
01:37:20.531 --> 01:37:23.170
<v Speaker 4>requires the most responsibility and </v>
<v Speaker 4>sacrifice.</v>

1852
01:37:23.171 --> 01:37:26.380
<v Speaker 4>And so I think is the most honorable and</v>
<v Speaker 4>least self deceptive.</v>

1853
01:37:26.710 --> 01:37:27.543
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

1854
01:37:35.740 --> 01:37:38.200
<v Speaker 4>what is your view on the Book Slash </v>
<v Speaker 4>Movie Fight Club?</v>

1855
01:37:38.201 --> 01:37:41.680
<v Speaker 4>I thought fight club was deeply fascist </v>
<v Speaker 4>in a very interesting way.</v>

1856
01:37:42.100 --> 01:37:43.420
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I,</v>

1857
01:37:43.490 --> 01:37:44.323
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying that I'm saying that some in </v>
<v Speaker 4>some way dismissively although I </v>

1858
01:37:47.861 --> 01:37:50.070
<v Speaker 4>actually liked the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I also think it was a,</v>

1859
01:37:50.071 --> 01:37:52.970
<v Speaker 4>it was fascist because it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

1860
01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.590
<v Speaker 4>it was a celebration in some sense of </v>
<v Speaker 4>force.</v>

1861
01:37:55.591 --> 01:37:59.460
<v Speaker 4>It was fascist sort of in the same way </v>
<v Speaker 4>that the iron man character is fascist,</v>

1862
01:37:59.461 --> 01:38:00.540
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1863
01:38:00.930 --> 01:38:01.763
<v Speaker 4>but I also thought it was a really </v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting exploration of the idea of </v>

1864
01:38:04.651 --> 01:38:06.930
<v Speaker 4>developing the shadow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

1865
01:38:07.290 --> 01:38:10.590
<v Speaker 4>and I do believe that if men don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>become consciously dangerous,</v>

1866
01:38:10.591 --> 01:38:11.424
<v Speaker 4>they become unconsciously dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so it's much better to become </v>

1867
01:38:13.681 --> 01:38:16.110
<v Speaker 4>consciously dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's something that every man should</v>

1868
01:38:16.111 --> 01:38:16.944
<v Speaker 4>really aim at.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you should be someone that no one </v>

1869
01:38:19.021 --> 01:38:19.854
<v Speaker 4>will mess with now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then you should keep that under </v>

1870
01:38:21.751 --> 01:38:22.710
<v Speaker 4>control,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1871
01:38:22.711 --> 01:38:24.000
<v Speaker 4>You should be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

1872
01:38:24.001 --> 01:38:26.430
<v Speaker 4>you should be harmless and naive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you're a child,</v>

1873
01:38:26.820 --> 01:38:29.130
<v Speaker 4>then you should develop your capacity to</v>
<v Speaker 4>be dangerous,</v>

1874
01:38:29.310 --> 01:38:32.550
<v Speaker 4>then you should bring that capacity to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be dangerous under control.</v>

1875
01:38:32.790 --> 01:38:35.190
<v Speaker 4>Then that makes you a man as far as I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>concerned.</v>

1876
01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:36.353
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

1877
01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:42.630
<v Speaker 4>Jared Chan says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just wanted to thank you very much.</v>

1878
01:38:42.660 --> 01:38:43.830
<v Speaker 4>Love you heaps,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1879
01:38:44.270 --> 01:38:46.550

1880
01:38:46.551 --> 01:38:47.361
<v Speaker 4>Thanks to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1881
01:38:47.361 --> 01:38:49.490
<v Speaker 4>you have to read them slowly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1882
01:38:49.491 --> 01:38:51.590
<v Speaker 4>There's no way you can read those fast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1883
01:38:51.591 --> 01:38:52.424
<v Speaker 4>watch out for yourself because those </v>
<v Speaker 4>things play vicious games with your </v>

1884
01:38:54.831 --> 01:38:56.660
<v Speaker 4>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So praying for you.</v>

1885
01:38:56.690 --> 01:38:58.340
<v Speaker 4>Well good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could use some prayer,</v>

1886
01:38:58.341 --> 01:39:00.050
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So thanks jared.</v>

1887
01:39:00.051 --> 01:39:03.170
<v Speaker 4>Much appreciate it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So good luck with the reading and,</v>

1888
01:39:03.171 --> 01:39:04.100
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1889
01:39:04.101 --> 01:39:04.934
<v Speaker 4>make sure you're doing something </v>
<v Speaker 4>practical and easy at the same time </v>

1890
01:39:07.041 --> 01:39:08.870
<v Speaker 4>because young,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's hard on person.</v>

1891
01:39:09.140 --> 01:39:09.973
<v Speaker 4>That's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you really want to twist your head </v>

1892
01:39:11.391 --> 01:39:13.040
<v Speaker 4>and a knot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could do some reading.</v>

1893
01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:15.320
<v Speaker 4>You could read some niche at the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

1894
01:39:15.321 --> 01:39:16.450
<v Speaker 4>It's a nice adjunct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1895
01:39:16.650 --> 01:39:19.100
<v Speaker 4>though you'll wrote some books on nature</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1896
01:39:19.140 --> 01:39:19.910
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his,</v>

1897
01:39:19.910 --> 01:39:22.400
<v Speaker 4>his commentaries on thus spake Sarah </v>
<v Speaker 4>Booster.</v>

1898
01:39:22.730 --> 01:39:23.563
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1899
01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:25.340
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good to hear from you.</v>

1900
01:39:25.341 --> 01:39:26.780
<v Speaker 4>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thanks very much man.</v>

1901
01:39:28.260 --> 01:39:28.550
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1902
01:39:28.550 --> 01:39:29.660
<v Speaker 4>so let's see.</v>

1903
01:39:51.530 --> 01:39:52.363
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>still haven't quite mastered this live </v>

1904
01:39:53.601 --> 01:39:55.340
<v Speaker 4>chat thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It zooms around quite a bit.</v>

1905
01:39:55.760 --> 01:39:56.593
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when was that high school student </v>

1906
01:39:57.291 --> 01:39:58.124
<v Speaker 4>program?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You were coming without coming out with </v>

1907
01:39:59.301 --> 01:40:00.200
<v Speaker 4>happening?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1908
01:40:00.201 --> 01:40:01.034
<v Speaker 4>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1909
01:40:01.460 --> 01:40:02.293
<v Speaker 4>that's the future authoring.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the self authoring program for high </v>

1910
01:40:04.071 --> 01:40:04.970
<v Speaker 4>school students,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

1911
01:40:05.180 --> 01:40:07.490
<v Speaker 4>we're trying to get that out by,</v>
<v Speaker 4>within a month,</v>

1912
01:40:07.550 --> 01:40:10.580
<v Speaker 4>but I can't say for sure because it's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>software development program,</v>

1913
01:40:10.581 --> 01:40:13.010
<v Speaker 4>but we're aiming out to fall,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's for sure.</v>

1914
01:40:13.011 --> 01:40:14.270
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1915
01:40:14.360 --> 01:40:15.980
<v Speaker 4>I know we're hoping it'll be a killer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1916
01:40:16.010 --> 01:40:18.890
<v Speaker 4>like the university self authoring </v>
<v Speaker 4>program was,</v>

1917
01:40:18.891 --> 01:40:19.610
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1918
01:40:19.610 --> 01:40:20.443
<v Speaker 4>for those of you who don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you probably all know cause you're </v>

1919
01:40:22.281 --> 01:40:23.114
<v Speaker 4>patriotic subscribers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the future authoring program seems </v>

1920
01:40:25.551 --> 01:40:28.700
<v Speaker 4>to improve the performance of college </v>
<v Speaker 4>students by about 25%.</v>

1921
01:40:28.701 --> 01:40:30.830
<v Speaker 4>We're hoping with the high school </v>
<v Speaker 4>students to uh,</v>

1922
01:40:31.880 --> 01:40:32.713
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1923
01:40:33.980 --> 01:40:34.813
<v Speaker 4>we'll have the same impact at a much </v>
<v Speaker 4>earlier age and to teach kids to define </v>

1924
01:40:37.921 --> 01:40:40.800
<v Speaker 4>themselves voluntarily and to start </v>
<v Speaker 4>charting their destiny.</v>

1925
01:40:40.801 --> 01:40:41.634
<v Speaker 4>That would be a lovely thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we're going to sell directly to the </v>

1926
01:40:42.871 --> 01:40:46.230
<v Speaker 4>high school students instead of trying </v>
<v Speaker 4>to go into schools and so forth,</v>

1927
01:40:46.231 --> 01:40:49.680
<v Speaker 4>which I think would be just an exercise </v>
<v Speaker 4>in frustration and utility.</v>

1928
01:40:50.340 --> 01:40:52.920
<v Speaker 4>I shouldn't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I don't know how this got set up.</v>

1929
01:40:52.921 --> 01:40:53.754
<v Speaker 4>I probably push some button that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't even notice is that some of you </v>

1930
01:40:55.691 --> 01:40:56.524
<v Speaker 4>seem to be donating money and the money </v>
<v Speaker 4>is associated with questions and I've </v>

1931
01:40:59.921 --> 01:41:00.754
<v Speaker 4>clicked on some of those and I hope,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure what to make of that </v>

1932
01:41:03.761 --> 01:41:04.594
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because I don't know how it happened </v>

1933
01:41:06.101 --> 01:41:06.934
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I want to make sure that I get </v>

1934
01:41:08.561 --> 01:41:10.450
<v Speaker 4>questions from everyone as much as I </v>
<v Speaker 4>can.</v>

1935
01:41:10.451 --> 01:41:13.780
<v Speaker 4>So if I miss you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hope that you're not donating unless I</v>

1936
01:41:13.781 --> 01:41:15.280
<v Speaker 4>actually click on your question.</v>

1937
01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:17.560
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if that isn't the case,</v>

1938
01:41:17.561 --> 01:41:18.394
<v Speaker 4>then I apologize.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to keep up with as many </v>

1939
01:41:19.811 --> 01:41:23.980
<v Speaker 4>questions as I possibly can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thoughts on the Jews.</v>

1940
01:41:24.340 --> 01:41:25.173
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the first thing I could say about Jews </v>

1941
01:41:26.111 --> 01:41:28.690
<v Speaker 4>is that a lot of my friends are happen </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be Jewish.</v>

1942
01:41:28.691 --> 01:41:29.524
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's partly because Jewish</v>
<v Speaker 4>people and me and that's in part a </v>

1943
01:41:33.821 --> 01:41:35.650
<v Speaker 4>cultural thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are very,</v>

1944
01:41:35.651 --> 01:41:36.484
<v Speaker 4>very interested in ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I happened to be very interested in </v>

1945
01:41:38.501 --> 01:41:41.410
<v Speaker 4>ideas and so I have a great affinity for</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jewish people.</v>

1946
01:41:41.411 --> 01:41:42.640
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1947
01:41:42.700 --> 01:41:43.533
<v Speaker 4>and I think that Jewish people are </v>
<v Speaker 4>overrepresented in positions of </v>

1948
01:41:46.601 --> 01:41:47.434
<v Speaker 4>competence and authority and that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>often because they're extraordinarily </v>

1949
01:41:50.171 --> 01:41:50.951
<v Speaker 4>competent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1950
01:41:50.951 --> 01:41:51.970
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hurry for them.</v>

1951
01:41:52.030 --> 01:41:54.220
<v Speaker 4>That's how it looks to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

1952
01:41:55.900 --> 01:41:58.720
<v Speaker 4>what do you have to say about girls who </v>
<v Speaker 4>grew up without fathers?</v>

1953
01:42:00.610 --> 01:42:01.443
<v Speaker 4>Be Very careful in who you choose as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>mate because you don't have that much </v>

1954
01:42:04.211 --> 01:42:06.400
<v Speaker 4>experience with what constitutes a good </v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1955
01:42:06.760 --> 01:42:08.620
<v Speaker 4>And so I would say be cautious,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1956
01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:12.850
<v Speaker 4>Be Cautious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look for someone who treats you well and</v>

1957
01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:14.320
<v Speaker 4>not because of weakness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1958
01:42:14.321 --> 01:42:15.670
<v Speaker 4>who's who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't be,</v>

1959
01:42:15.970 --> 01:42:19.330
<v Speaker 4>don't confuse being afraid to offend you</v>
<v Speaker 4>with treating you well.</v>

1960
01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:20.433
<v Speaker 4>Someone who treats you well as someone </v>
<v Speaker 4>who's tough and forthright and self </v>

1961
01:42:23.101 --> 01:42:23.934
<v Speaker 4>reliant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but who is able to listen and to </v>

1962
01:42:26.560 --> 01:42:28.960
<v Speaker 4>negotiate in particular and to tell you </v>
<v Speaker 4>the truth.</v>

1963
01:42:29.320 --> 01:42:30.370
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1964
01:42:30.400 --> 01:42:33.670
<v Speaker 4>and don't give yourself away too easily.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's what I would say to girls,</v>

1965
01:42:33.671 --> 01:42:35.860
<v Speaker 4>period is don't give yourself away too </v>
<v Speaker 4>easily.</v>

1966
01:42:35.861 --> 01:42:37.780
<v Speaker 4>It's a big mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'll regret it.</v>

1967
01:42:38.210 --> 01:42:39.250
<v Speaker 4>You'll regret it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

1968
01:42:50.410 --> 01:42:54.430
<v Speaker 4>I'm starting to slow down here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nature was pretty fun to read.</v>

1969
01:42:54.431 --> 01:42:55.690
<v Speaker 4>Got All his works.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nino,</v>

1970
01:42:55.691 --> 01:42:56.524
<v Speaker 4>the sinner.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that should really help you with </v>

1971
01:42:57.611 --> 01:42:58.840
<v Speaker 4>your sitting there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nino.</v>

1972
01:42:59.140 --> 01:43:00.700
<v Speaker 4>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nicha he's a,</v>

1973
01:43:00.730 --> 01:43:02.080
<v Speaker 4>he's a trip,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's for sure.</v>

1974
01:43:02.081 --> 01:43:03.810
<v Speaker 4>If you guys are thinking about reading </v>
<v Speaker 4>each of,</v>

1975
01:43:03.811 --> 01:43:06.090
<v Speaker 4>don't start with thus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thus spake Sarah through story.</v>

1976
01:43:06.091 --> 01:43:08.740
<v Speaker 4>You should read that last,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would start with beyond good and evil.</v>

1977
01:43:09.220 --> 01:43:10.053
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a fun is a pretty weird way to describe </v>

1978
01:43:12.311 --> 01:43:14.020
<v Speaker 4>it though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Read Dostoyevsky too.</v>

1979
01:43:14.021 --> 01:43:14.854
<v Speaker 4>That'd be good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What advice would you give to a person </v>

1980
01:43:17.291 --> 01:43:18.124
<v Speaker 4>high in agreeableness and </v>
<v Speaker 4>conscientiousness get a significant </v>

1981
01:43:20.621 --> 01:43:24.490
<v Speaker 4>other who is left leaning or one who is </v>
<v Speaker 4>leaning towards radical leftism?</v>

1982
01:43:25.450 --> 01:43:26.283
<v Speaker 4>I would say get a significant other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't get a significant other based on </v>

1983
01:43:29.831 --> 01:43:31.330
<v Speaker 4>their political,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1984
01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:32.680
<v Speaker 4>predispositions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1985
01:43:33.210 --> 01:43:34.043
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get a significant other that you can </v>

1986
01:43:35.861 --> 01:43:36.694
<v Speaker 4>trust and that you are attracted to and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you want to build a life with and </v>

1987
01:43:39.490 --> 01:43:40.323
<v Speaker 4>leave the political stuff for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for when it's necessary because the </v>

1988
01:43:43.421 --> 01:43:46.120
<v Speaker 4>political stuff should only be engaged </v>
<v Speaker 4>in when it's necessary.</v>

1989
01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:49.300
<v Speaker 4>Do you think Islam is compatible with </v>
<v Speaker 4>the West?</v>

1990
01:43:52.120 --> 01:43:55.060
<v Speaker 4>Not In any self evident manner.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1991
01:43:55.480 --> 01:43:56.313
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>although I would also say that Islam is </v>

1992
01:43:57.341 --> 01:43:58.360
<v Speaker 4>part of the West,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1993
01:43:58.361 --> 01:44:00.520
<v Speaker 4>we should actually give that some </v>
<v Speaker 4>consideration.</v>

1994
01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:03.520
<v Speaker 4>Do you mean is Islam compatible with </v>
<v Speaker 4>Christianity?</v>

1995
01:44:03.960 --> 01:44:06.490
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hope so,</v>

1996
01:44:06.520 --> 01:44:07.353
<v Speaker 4>but it isn't obvious to me in what </v>
<v Speaker 4>manner it's compatible with </v>

1997
01:44:10.151 --> 01:44:11.260
<v Speaker 4>Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll see.</v>

1998
01:44:11.261 --> 01:44:14.380
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't mean that Muslims aren't </v>
<v Speaker 4>compatible with Western society.</v>

1999
01:44:14.381 --> 01:44:15.214
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2000
01:44:15.460 --> 01:44:19.960
<v Speaker 4>many Muslims are no more radical Muslims</v>
<v Speaker 4>than Christians are radical Christians.</v>

2001
01:44:19.961 --> 01:44:20.794
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>many Muslims aren't any more Muslims </v>

2002
01:44:22.511 --> 01:44:24.490
<v Speaker 4>than many Christians are Christians.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

2003
01:44:24.910 --> 01:44:25.743
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say generally speaking across </v>

2004
01:44:27.671 --> 01:44:28.504
<v Speaker 4>populations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people are pretty decent and as </v>

2005
01:44:31.061 --> 01:44:32.170
<v Speaker 4>individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2006
01:44:32.440 --> 01:44:33.273
<v Speaker 4>generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that doesn't necessarily mean that </v>

2007
01:44:35.741 --> 01:44:38.200
<v Speaker 4>the belief systems that they inhabit or </v>
<v Speaker 4>commensurate.</v>

2008
01:44:38.201 --> 01:44:39.034
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2009
01:44:39.910 --> 01:44:40.743
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

2010
01:44:40.830 --> 01:44:41.920
<v Speaker 4>All Cap,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2011
01:44:41.921 --> 01:44:44.600
<v Speaker 4>Says I think you should fortify your </v>
<v Speaker 4>ideas on Christianity.</v>

2012
01:44:44.660 --> 01:44:49.660
<v Speaker 4>I am doing my best to do exactly that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So Dr. Peterson,</v>

2013
01:44:50.391 --> 01:44:53.390
<v Speaker 4>what was your relationship like with </v>
<v Speaker 4>your mother and father hits pr?</v>

2014
01:44:53.410 --> 01:44:54.920
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>andy is pretty good.</v>

2015
01:44:54.921 --> 01:44:56.480
<v Speaker 4>They're both still alive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thank God.</v>

2016
01:44:56.481 --> 01:44:59.840
<v Speaker 4>I just went up and saw my dad for his </v>
<v Speaker 4>80th birthday.</v>

2017
01:44:59.841 --> 01:45:01.530
<v Speaker 4>He's in good shape.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2018
01:45:01.910 --> 01:45:04.310
<v Speaker 4>I actually gave him a Keka Stan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he flag as a joke,</v>

2019
01:45:04.311 --> 01:45:05.144
<v Speaker 4>which he really appreciated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I think he's got that flying up in </v>

2020
01:45:07.461 --> 01:45:09.800
<v Speaker 4>his cabin way the hell up in northern </v>
<v Speaker 4>Saskatchewan,</v>

2021
01:45:09.801 --> 01:45:12.150
<v Speaker 4>which I think is pretty comical.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2022
01:45:12.590 --> 01:45:13.423
<v Speaker 4>I loved my parents deeply there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've been a great source of support </v>

2023
01:45:16.611 --> 01:45:18.200
<v Speaker 4>for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My father,</v>

2024
01:45:18.320 --> 01:45:20.930
<v Speaker 4>I had some struggles with my father when</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was an adolescent,</v>

2025
01:45:20.931 --> 01:45:24.620
<v Speaker 4>partly because I think partly because I </v>
<v Speaker 4>was depressed and so was he.</v>

2026
01:45:25.100 --> 01:45:27.620
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was a great father when I was a young</v>

2027
01:45:27.740 --> 01:45:28.130
<v Speaker 4>child.</v>

2028
01:45:28.130 --> 01:45:31.490
<v Speaker 4>He spent so much time with me and paid </v>
<v Speaker 4>so much attention to me and taught me to</v>

2029
01:45:31.491 --> 01:45:36.140
<v Speaker 4>read and like I have nothing but great </v>
<v Speaker 4>memories of him before grade six.</v>

2030
01:45:36.141 --> 01:45:38.820
<v Speaker 4>And then we had about three years that </v>
<v Speaker 4>were rocky mall,</v>

2031
01:45:38.821 --> 01:45:39.654
<v Speaker 4>more than that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably about five years that were </v>

2032
01:45:40.941 --> 01:45:42.320
<v Speaker 4>rocky,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2033
01:45:42.650 --> 01:45:45.620
<v Speaker 4>which we both contributed to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so did other circumstances,</v>

2034
01:45:45.621 --> 01:45:49.310
<v Speaker 4>but mean since I moved away from home,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I did at 16,</v>

2035
01:45:49.810 --> 01:45:51.950
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've got along just fine and I think we</v>

2036
01:45:51.951 --> 01:45:52.784
<v Speaker 4>have an absolutely superb relationship </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they've been incredibly useful and </v>

2037
01:45:55.581 --> 01:45:57.120
<v Speaker 4>supportive in the last year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2038
01:45:57.350 --> 01:46:01.160
<v Speaker 4>and my mother is a wonderful person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's a little too agreeable for her own</v>

2039
01:46:01.161 --> 01:46:02.390
<v Speaker 4>good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she's tough.</v>

2040
01:46:02.990 --> 01:46:04.520
<v Speaker 4>And she had a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2041
01:46:04.650 --> 01:46:05.483
<v Speaker 4>she raised three kids and she went out </v>
<v Speaker 4>and had a career and she's put up with </v>

2042
01:46:07.941 --> 01:46:10.220
<v Speaker 4>my dad who's a pretty tough,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stubborn guy.</v>

2043
01:46:10.670 --> 01:46:11.503
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2044
01:46:12.380 --> 01:46:13.213
<v Speaker 4>she's a lovely person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love her deeply and she's been very </v>

2045
01:46:15.381 --> 01:46:16.460
<v Speaker 4>good to my kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2046
01:46:16.461 --> 01:46:17.690
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2047
01:46:18.020 --> 01:46:18.650
<v Speaker 4>I've had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2048
01:46:18.650 --> 01:46:21.050
<v Speaker 4>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have had a good relationship with them</v>

2049
01:46:21.051 --> 01:46:21.884
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say it's just gotten better and </v>

2050
01:46:22.791 --> 01:46:25.280
<v Speaker 4>better as we've got older and straighten</v>
<v Speaker 4>ourselves out.</v>

2051
01:46:25.281 --> 01:46:27.290
<v Speaker 4>And I would say that about my whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>family,</v>

2052
01:46:27.291 --> 01:46:31.310
<v Speaker 4>including my sister and my brother and </v>
<v Speaker 4>their family and it's functioning pretty</v>

2053
01:46:31.311 --> 01:46:33.680
<v Speaker 4>damn well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so thank God for that man.</v>

2054
01:46:34.310 --> 01:46:35.143
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

2055
01:46:37.410 --> 01:46:39.780
<v Speaker 4>I have a friend who's considering </v>
<v Speaker 4>majoring in psychology.</v>

2056
01:46:39.781 --> 01:46:41.440
<v Speaker 4>What advice would I give them?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2057
01:46:42.150 --> 01:46:44.670
<v Speaker 4>stick to the biological end of it as </v>
<v Speaker 4>much as possible.</v>

2058
01:46:44.750 --> 01:46:47.160
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with the exception of the clinical great</v>

2059
01:46:47.161 --> 01:46:47.994
<v Speaker 4>clinical works because they're very much</v>
<v Speaker 4>reading master your damn statistics </v>

2060
01:46:51.691 --> 01:46:54.360
<v Speaker 4>because that'll open up career doors for</v>

2063
01:46:59.281 --> 01:47:01.860
<v Speaker 4>valuable that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's almost incomprehensible.</v>

2064
01:47:02.250 --> 01:47:03.083
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

2066

<v Speaker 4>learn to analyze the research reports </v>
<v Speaker 4>and pay attention and it can be an </v>

2067
01:47:10.141 --> 01:47:13.530
<v Speaker 4>absolutely great career.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right guys,</v>

2068
01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:18.560
<v Speaker 4>it's been a long day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I spent most of today writing my chapter</v>

2069
01:47:20.461 --> 01:47:22.770
<v Speaker 4>seven of my new book called 12 rules for</v>
<v Speaker 4>life,</v>

2070
01:47:22.771 --> 01:47:25.860
<v Speaker 4>which is absolutely deadly chapter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just about killed me.</v>

2071
01:47:26.220 --> 01:47:27.053
<v Speaker 4>I have gone over today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went over every word and every </v>

2072
01:47:29.911 --> 01:47:34.170
<v Speaker 4>sentence and rewrote them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's a chapter on sacrifice and work</v>

2073
01:47:34.171 --> 01:47:38.430
<v Speaker 4>and the battle between good and evil and</v>
<v Speaker 4>Christianity and,</v>

2074
01:47:38.490 --> 01:47:42.000
<v Speaker 4>and the nature of a meaningful life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's,</v>

2075
01:47:42.030 --> 01:47:44.440
<v Speaker 4>it's been hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

2076
01:47:45.310 --> 01:47:45.750
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2077
01:47:45.750 --> 01:47:46.583
<v Speaker 4>And I'm tired and although this has been</v>
<v Speaker 4>great fun and I would like to say in </v>

2078
01:47:50.431 --> 01:47:51.600
<v Speaker 4>closing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>once again,</v>

2079
01:47:51.630 --> 01:47:54.840
<v Speaker 4>thank you very much for the support and </v>
<v Speaker 4>for all of the,</v>

2080
01:47:55.140 --> 01:47:55.973
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm absolutely overwhelmed by the </v>

2081
01:47:57.510 --> 01:48:01.230
<v Speaker 4>positive response my work has got over </v>
<v Speaker 4>the last year.</v>

2082
01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:04.250
<v Speaker 4>It's been very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2083
01:48:04.470 --> 01:48:09.470
<v Speaker 4>I've been amazingly well compensated </v>
<v Speaker 4>both financially and psychologically for</v>

2084
01:48:11.131 --> 01:48:13.140
<v Speaker 4>my efforts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I'm thrilled about.</v>

2085
01:48:13.170 --> 01:48:18.170
<v Speaker 4>And I hope that I can keep delivering to</v>
<v Speaker 4>you what it is that you seem to be.</v>

2086
01:48:19.650 --> 01:48:21.750
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what would you say?</v>

2087
01:48:22.590 --> 01:48:23.423
<v Speaker 4>I hope that I can continue to deliver </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is that I'd been delivering </v>

2088
01:48:28.201 --> 01:48:29.034
<v Speaker 4>in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That all of you have been finding a </v>

2089
01:48:31.021 --> 01:48:32.880
<v Speaker 4>value.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am doing my best to do that.</v>

2090
01:48:32.881 --> 01:48:33.714
<v Speaker 4>I think it's the right way forward out </v>
<v Speaker 4>of this bloody chaotic political mess </v>

2091
01:48:36.841 --> 01:48:38.130
<v Speaker 4>that we're in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the,</v>

2092
01:48:38.131 --> 01:48:38.791
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I mean,</v>

2093
01:48:38.791 --> 01:48:39.624
<v Speaker 4>I've been thinking about that for years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know that the way out of the </v>

2094
01:48:41.641 --> 01:48:46.641
<v Speaker 4>ideological morass is the strengthening </v>
<v Speaker 4>and fortification of the individual.</v>

2095
01:48:46.861 --> 01:48:50.010
<v Speaker 4>And I hope you all participate in that </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's,</v>

2096
01:48:51.420 --> 01:48:52.260
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

2097
01:48:53.190 --> 01:48:55.980
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a Cliche,</v>

2098
01:48:55.981 --> 01:48:57.930
<v Speaker 4>but I'm getting tired.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's the best I can do.</v>

2099
01:48:57.931 --> 01:48:58.764
<v Speaker 4>There's no limits to what a person who </v>
<v Speaker 4>decides to put themselves together can </v>

2100
01:49:02.281 --> 01:49:03.114
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I would very much encourage all </v>

2101
01:49:05.161 --> 01:49:05.994
<v Speaker 4>of you to aim at that because what the </v>
<v Speaker 4>hell else have you got to do in this </v>

2102
01:49:09.151 --> 01:49:11.070
<v Speaker 4>like veil of tears?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's tragic.</v>

2103
01:49:11.071 --> 01:49:14.250
<v Speaker 4>Veil of tears,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but put yourself together and prevail.</v>

2104
01:49:14.640 --> 01:49:16.230
<v Speaker 4>And so on that note,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2105
01:49:16.680 --> 01:49:18.900
<v Speaker 4>over now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'll talk to you all in a month.</v>
