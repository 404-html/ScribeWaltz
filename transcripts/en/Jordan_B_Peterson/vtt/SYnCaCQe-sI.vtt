1
00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.153
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you shocked at the amount of people </v>

2
00:00:03.971 --> 00:00:06.880
<v Speaker 1>that live in western societies here in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Norway,</v>

3
00:00:06.881 --> 00:00:08.980
<v Speaker 1>especially when we were in Sweden a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of days ago,</v>

4
00:00:08.981 --> 00:00:09.814
<v Speaker 1>but all the countries that we've been in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that live in free societies yet are </v>

5
00:00:13.191 --> 00:00:15.700
<v Speaker 1>completely afraid to say what they </v>
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>

6
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.300
<v Speaker 1>Is it absolutely shocking to you?</v>

7
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.433
<v Speaker 2>I think the most.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what I've been most shocked </v>

8
00:00:23.781 --> 00:00:24.614
<v Speaker 2>about in all of that is what's happened </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the UK with the police starting to </v>

9
00:00:29.721 --> 00:00:32.870
<v Speaker 2>prosecute people for crimes of </v>
<v Speaker 2>offensiveness.</v>

10
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.033
<v Speaker 2>That's just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's probably partly </v>

11
00:00:36.261 --> 00:00:37.094
<v Speaker 2>because I'm an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I see that as broadly reflective </v>

12
00:00:39.201 --> 00:00:40.034
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of something that's happening in the </v>

13
00:00:40.731 --> 00:00:41.564
<v Speaker 2>West in general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's particularly shocking and </v>

14
00:00:43.791 --> 00:00:46.460
<v Speaker 2>appalling to me as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a western Canadian,</v>

15
00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because obviously Canada was part of the</v>

16
00:00:49.371 --> 00:00:50.204
<v Speaker 2>British empire and when I grew up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there was a pretty tight affinity </v>

17
00:00:53.301 --> 00:00:56.240
<v Speaker 2>still in western Canada with the British</v>
<v Speaker 2>empire.</v>

18
00:00:56.241 --> 00:00:59.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our maps where the dominion of Canada,</v>

19
00:00:59.391 --> 00:01:00.920
<v Speaker 2>it was still pink,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

20
00:01:00.921 --> 00:01:02.390
<v Speaker 2>it was still a part of the British </v>
<v Speaker 2>empire.</v>

21
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.260
<v Speaker 2>We saying God save the Queen Constantly </v>
<v Speaker 2>at public gatherings.</v>

22
00:01:06.261 --> 00:01:10.850
<v Speaker 2>That's gone by the wayside and so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

23
00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.823
<v Speaker 2>I've always regarded British common law </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the British parliamentary tradition </v>

24
00:01:17.331 --> 00:01:19.070
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>

25
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.270
<v Speaker 2>One of it perhaps the highest </v>
<v Speaker 2>achievement of western civilization.</v>

26
00:01:23.271 --> 00:01:25.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean you could argue about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

27
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.990
<v Speaker 2>it's in the top 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

28
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.270
<v Speaker 2>and then to see the Brits who also have </v>
<v Speaker 2>this phenomenal sense of humor,</v>

29
00:01:32.271 --> 00:01:33.104
<v Speaker 2>this ability to say anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter how outrageous about anyone </v>

30
00:01:36.411 --> 00:01:39.620
<v Speaker 2>and to include themselves in the joke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

31
00:01:39.621 --> 00:01:40.454
<v Speaker 2>Which is such an elegant way of </v>
<v Speaker 2>expressing comedic freedom to see them </v>

32
00:01:46.011 --> 00:01:48.890
<v Speaker 2>going down this road is just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>

33
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.210
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

34
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.300
<v Speaker 2>it's what is it exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

35
00:01:53.301 --> 00:01:55.940
<v Speaker 2>it's deeply saddening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's for sure.</v>

36
00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.953
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what's horrifying and it's not </v>

37
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.113
<v Speaker 2>exactly the right wording.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the word for it is </v>

38
00:02:03.201 --> 00:02:04.034
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Certainly sorrow that's associated with </v>

39
00:02:05.241 --> 00:02:07.670
<v Speaker 2>a disbelief.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also that at,</v>

40
00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.010
<v Speaker 2>at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at,</v>

41
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.080
<v Speaker 2>at watching that happen in what I still </v>
<v Speaker 2>think is the central core of the idea of</v>

42
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.700
<v Speaker 2>individual sovereignty and freedom as </v>
<v Speaker 2>expressed across the western world.</v>

43
00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.983
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then there's similar manifestations </v>

44
00:02:23.511 --> 00:02:24.344
<v Speaker 2>of that everywhere else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the police per prosecuting people </v>

45
00:02:27.051 --> 00:02:28.180
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

46
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.510
<v Speaker 2>asking people to turn in their neighbors</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they say something offensive.</v>

47
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.150
<v Speaker 2>And that's happening in the UK.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

48
00:02:35.151 --> 00:02:35.600
<v Speaker 2>Litter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

49
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.433
<v Speaker 2>we saw that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

50
00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody sent me posters,</v>

51
00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.280
<v Speaker 2>pictures of posters in the Scottish </v>
<v Speaker 2>subway,</v>

52
00:02:43.281 --> 00:02:44.270
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the metro,</v>

53
00:02:44.271 --> 00:02:45.530
<v Speaker 2>in the tube,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

54
00:02:45.531 --> 00:02:50.531
<v Speaker 2>saying inviting people to inform on </v>
<v Speaker 2>their neighbors for being offensive.</v>

55
00:02:50.571 --> 00:02:52.610
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the hell,</v>

56
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:53.190
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

57
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.620
<v Speaker 2>So I knew this was coming because.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I knew</v>

58
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.250
<v Speaker 2>we brought our first speech laws in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Canada back in the 19 eighties.</v>

59
00:03:03.251 --> 00:03:05.920
<v Speaker 2>We were after this character named Ernst</v>
<v Speaker 2>Zandel,</v>

60
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.470
<v Speaker 2>who is particularly despicable piece of </v>
<v Speaker 2>work,</v>

61
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.333
<v Speaker 2>hard hat wearing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right wing antisemitism Holocaust </v>

62
00:03:12.821 --> 00:03:13.690
<v Speaker 2>denier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

63
00:03:13.691 --> 00:03:18.691
<v Speaker 2>he had it all that guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was his</v>

64
00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.853
<v Speaker 2>shenanigans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>careless malevolent shenanigans that </v>

65
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.630
<v Speaker 2>entice Canadians into producing hate </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech legislation.</v>

66
00:03:30.631 --> 00:03:31.800
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

67
00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.990
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not good.</v>

68
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.140
<v Speaker 2>It's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're making a big mistake.</v>

69
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.960
<v Speaker 2>We're going to pay for this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to unfold over a long time.</v>

70
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.820
<v Speaker 2>Who defines hate</v>

71
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.660
<v Speaker 2>the crucial issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like it's a scientific category</v>

72
00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.943
<v Speaker 2>to judgment and the answer is those whom</v>
<v Speaker 2>you least want to have the power to </v>

73
00:03:54.051 --> 00:03:57.530
<v Speaker 2>define it because they're the ones that </v>
<v Speaker 2>will take that power to themselves.</v>

74
00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:00.260
<v Speaker 2>And if you think that isn't gonna Affect</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you get to say,</v>

75
00:04:00.261 --> 00:04:04.400
<v Speaker 2>well you've got another thing coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think it's,</v>

76
00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:05.653
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to pay for it and hopefully </v>

77
00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.093
<v Speaker 2>hopefully we'll wake up and push back </v>
<v Speaker 2>before we have to pay too high a price </v>

78
00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.830
<v Speaker 2>to pay for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

79
00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we're going to deserve to pay for it</v>

80
00:04:21.981 --> 00:04:26.000
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's talking to you</v>

81
00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.610
<v Speaker 3>last night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Last night that</v>

82
00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.320
<v Speaker 2>was on this British show called question</v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

83
00:04:38.321 --> 00:04:41.080
<v Speaker 2>which is very famous British show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there was a,</v>

84
00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.420
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a woman parliamentarian.</v>

85
00:04:43.421 --> 00:04:45.250
<v Speaker 2>They're from Ireland who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is pretty bright.</v>

86
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:46.473
<v Speaker 2>I like listening to her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm the host asked me about this </v>

87
00:04:51.221 --> 00:04:52.560
<v Speaker 2>character named count.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dang,</v>

88
00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:53.403
<v Speaker 2>Kyla,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you know about him and </v>

89
00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:56.103
<v Speaker 2>his girlfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a comedian while he thinks he's a </v>

90
00:04:59.141 --> 00:05:01.030
<v Speaker 2>comedian and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

91
00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.893
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are lots of Comedians who think </v>

92
00:05:04.541 --> 00:05:05.374
<v Speaker 2>they're comedians that aren't funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not saying he's not funny </v>

93
00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:10.030
<v Speaker 2>because other people think that he's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedian too,</v>

94
00:05:10.031 --> 00:05:12.430
<v Speaker 2>but he presents himself as a comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Count.</v>

95
00:05:12.431 --> 00:05:15.340
<v Speaker 2>Dang killer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's actually a joke,</v>

96
00:05:15.341 --> 00:05:20.341
<v Speaker 2>that name and his girlfriend had a pug </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I liked count Dan Kennedy because he</v>

97
00:05:21.311 --> 00:05:24.940
<v Speaker 2>hated that Pug and I'm not very fond of </v>
<v Speaker 2>pugs.</v>

98
00:05:24.941 --> 00:05:27.490
<v Speaker 2>I think they're hideous little creatures</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

99
00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:28.690
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

100
00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:30.243
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really hate them if a pug comes </v>

101
00:05:33.071 --> 00:05:35.950
<v Speaker 2>along then all pet it and everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's just sort of like the,</v>

102
00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.260
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this little dog with these bugs,</v>

103
00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you hit it on the back of the head,</v>

104
00:05:42.341 --> 00:05:43.630
<v Speaker 2>the eyes will pop out.</v>

105
00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.910
<v Speaker 2>And so because they've been so </v>
<v Speaker 2>genetically mishandled and so,</v>

106
00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.171
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

107
00:05:50.171 --> 00:05:51.004
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you realize we're putting this on </v>

108
00:05:52.571 --> 00:05:56.780
<v Speaker 2>youtube and you're just done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're unleashing a whole new world.</v>

109
00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:58.360
<v Speaker 2>People.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

110
00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.353
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

111
00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:00.430
<v Speaker 2>Whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

112
00:06:00.431 --> 00:06:02.080
<v Speaker 2>So you can have your and you can love </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

113
00:06:02.081 --> 00:06:02.914
<v Speaker 2>My Dad had this dog that was so damn </v>
<v Speaker 2>hideous and useless that it was just a </v>

114
00:06:05.651 --> 00:06:08.230
<v Speaker 2>miracle and he loved it to death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

115
00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:09.670
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fine,</v>

116
00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:10.533
<v Speaker 2>that's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's kind of an ironic attitude </v>

117
00:06:12.911 --> 00:06:17.480
<v Speaker 2>in the dismissal of pugs and Denckla </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't like his girlfriend's punk.</v>

118
00:06:17.481 --> 00:06:19.960
<v Speaker 2>And so he thought he'd play a mean trick</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

119
00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:24.250
<v Speaker 2>or amine slash funny trick and teach it </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do a hail Hitler salute.</v>

120
00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:26.370
<v Speaker 2>Which I actually thought was quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>funny.</v>

121
00:06:26.371 --> 00:06:27.990
<v Speaker 2>It's like I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

122
00:06:27.991 --> 00:06:32.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't see that as glorifying Hitler </v>
<v Speaker 2>hits up Pug for God's sake.</v>

123
00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:34.223
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

124
00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:37.140
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you call those Doberman,</v>

125
00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a pug that's like teaching a wrap</v>

126
00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:43.770
<v Speaker 2>to do hail Hitler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Salute.</v>

127
00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.530
<v Speaker 2>I love how this has come down to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>breed of dogs with you.</v>

128
00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:50.900
<v Speaker 2>These things matter in terms of their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way they're represented,</v>

129
00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:51.763
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>

130
00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:53.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

131
00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:58.050
<v Speaker 2>he taught it to so horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He and I'm gonna be so killed for this.</v>

132
00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.580
<v Speaker 2>He taught him to do it's little salute </v>
<v Speaker 2>when he said gas the Jews,</v>

133
00:07:04.581 --> 00:07:08.450
<v Speaker 2>which is not funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It except it's horribly funny,</v>

134
00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:09.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing.</v>

135
00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:11.070
<v Speaker 2>Well look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so yeah,</v>

136
00:07:11.071 --> 00:07:12.330
<v Speaker 2>you laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

137
00:07:12.331 --> 00:07:14.250
<v Speaker 2>Because you're all horrible and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

138
00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:17.800
<v Speaker 2>and you know perfectly well that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>horribly funny</v>

139
00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:26.273
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need,</v>

140
00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:27.323
<v Speaker 2>we need to be able to be horribly funny </v>
<v Speaker 2>because life is horrible and we and we </v>

141
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:32.383
<v Speaker 2>need to be able to find.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to be able to allow people the </v>

142
00:07:36.471 --> 00:07:37.304
<v Speaker 2>freedom to find the ability to transcend</v>
<v Speaker 2>that horror with comedy and a mark of a </v>

143
00:07:42.951 --> 00:07:47.750
<v Speaker 2>free society is that comedians can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>just exactly what the is,</v>

144
00:07:47.751 --> 00:07:50.780
<v Speaker 2>which there people who push the edge of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's acceptable.</v>

145
00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.780
<v Speaker 2>If you're a brilliant comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get right to the edge,</v>

146
00:07:53.781 --> 00:07:54.614
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you dance there and the audience is </v>

147
00:07:55.851 --> 00:07:58.360
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sarah Silvermans a good example of that.</v>

148
00:07:58.361 --> 00:07:59.720
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you can just see her.</v>

149
00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:01.610
<v Speaker 2>She's gone all politically correct </v>
<v Speaker 2>recently.</v>

150
00:08:01.611 --> 00:08:04.070
<v Speaker 2>But when she was in her heyday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could just see Sarah,</v>

151
00:08:04.071 --> 00:08:06.490
<v Speaker 2>she's so smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd see you're sitting there and she'd</v>

152
00:08:06.491 --> 00:08:10.940
<v Speaker 2>think of something just spectacularly </v>
<v Speaker 2>evil and horrible.</v>

153
00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:13.370
<v Speaker 2>And she think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

154
00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.010
<v Speaker 2>and then she say it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

155
00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:15.853
<v Speaker 2>and everyone would just crack up because</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the darkest part of their soul had </v>

156
00:08:18.981 --> 00:08:22.430
<v Speaker 2>once thought something like that and she</v>
<v Speaker 2>dared to outer red 10.</v>

157
00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:25.760
<v Speaker 2>And by honoring it she also </v>
<v Speaker 2>simultaneously transcended it,</v>

158
00:08:25.761 --> 00:08:27.990
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the beauty of comedy and,</v>

159
00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.880
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and well.</v>

160
00:08:29.881 --> 00:08:31.680
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they went after Dane,</v>

161
00:08:31.681 --> 00:08:34.530
<v Speaker 2>Kyla and nailed him legally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I thought that's an,</v>

162
00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:36.720
<v Speaker 2>that's in Great Britain as well last </v>
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>

163
00:08:36.721 --> 00:08:40.690
<v Speaker 2>So they brought this up on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on question time and you know,</v>

164
00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:41.733
<v Speaker 2>the Irish woman who said she went off on</v>
<v Speaker 2>a talk about how terrible Kristallnacht </v>

165
00:08:47.821 --> 00:08:48.654
<v Speaker 2>wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what an awful thing Auschwitz Holocaust </v>

166
00:08:51.541 --> 00:08:52.560
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

167
00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:53.543
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

168
00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:03.660
<v Speaker 2>you're not that morally virtuous to </v>
<v Speaker 2>notice that.</v>

169
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:05.933
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it didn't have anything to do </v>

170
00:09:07.561 --> 00:09:09.360
<v Speaker 2>with the topic at hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

171
00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:13.050
<v Speaker 2>yet you wouldn't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You notice that unless you were implying</v>

172
00:09:13.051 --> 00:09:15.810
<v Speaker 2>that where there are people around you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including this count,</v>

173
00:09:15.811 --> 00:09:18.510
<v Speaker 2>dank killer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who didn't notice that.</v>

174
00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:20.213
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It had nothing to do with whether he </v>

175
00:09:21.421 --> 00:09:23.820
<v Speaker 2>should have been prosecuted for his </v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid joke.</v>

176
00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:25.860
<v Speaker 2>And you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

177
00:09:25.861 --> 00:09:28.290
<v Speaker 2>you could say I was a stupid joke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which it certainly was.</v>

178
00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:30.900
<v Speaker 2>You could say that it was a hateful </v>
<v Speaker 2>joke,</v>

179
00:09:30.901 --> 00:09:31.734
<v Speaker 2>which I don't agree with by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you could say that and I think you </v>

180
00:09:34.171 --> 00:09:36.780
<v Speaker 2>could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could make a credible case for that.</v>

181
00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:40.620
<v Speaker 2>But then to say that because you think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the holocaust was bad,</v>

182
00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:42.900
<v Speaker 2>he should be criminally prosecuted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

183
00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.190
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry man,</v>

184
00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:47.580
<v Speaker 2>you've crossed the line and there's no </v>
<v Speaker 2>excuse for it.</v>

185
00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:53.090
<v Speaker 2>And so that's part of what's worrisome </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the state of discourse in the free</v>

186
00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:56.940
<v Speaker 2>West.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That same thing,</v>

187
00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:59.070
<v Speaker 2>comedians won't go to university </v>
<v Speaker 2>campuses,</v>

188
00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:01.530
<v Speaker 2>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't get to be funny.</v>

189
00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.100
<v Speaker 2>So if you can't be funny then you're not</v>
<v Speaker 2>free.</v>

190
00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:08.540
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gesture and the king's courts,</v>

191
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:10.350
<v Speaker 2>the only person who gets to tell the </v>
<v Speaker 2>truth.</v>

192
00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:13.170
<v Speaker 2>And if the king is such a tyrant that he</v>
<v Speaker 2>kills his gesture,</v>

193
00:10:13.171 --> 00:10:15.870
<v Speaker 2>then you know that the evil king is in </v>
<v Speaker 2>charge.</v>

194
00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.390
<v Speaker 2>And so when we can't tolerate our </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedians,</v>

195
00:10:18.391 --> 00:10:18.991
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

196
00:10:18.991 --> 00:10:21.030
<v Speaker 2>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're the canaries in the coal mine as</v>

197
00:10:21.031 --> 00:10:21.960
<v Speaker 2>far as I'm concerned.</v>

198
00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:28.060
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

199
00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:37.743
<v Speaker 2>My wife that I wouldn't hit any hornets </v>
<v Speaker 2>with any Hornet's nest with sticks for </v>

200
00:10:42.401 --> 00:10:46.090
<v Speaker 2>like a day and now I just hit a big </v>
<v Speaker 2>hornet's nest with the stick.</v>

201
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:49.070
<v Speaker 2>So sorry Tammy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's here somewhere.</v>

202
00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:50.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Give it up for Jordan's wife,</v>

203
00:10:50.721 --> 00:10:51.560
<v Speaker 2>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's been.</v>

204
00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:57.500
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>
