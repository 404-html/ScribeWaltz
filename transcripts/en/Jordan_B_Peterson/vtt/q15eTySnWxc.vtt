1
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.190
<v Speaker 1>Okay</v>
<v Speaker 1>on</v>

2
00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.850
<v Speaker 1>to more trait</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness.</v>

3
00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.640
<v Speaker 2>Conscientiousness is a good predictor of</v>
<v Speaker 2>longterm life success.</v>

4
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.860
<v Speaker 2>It's a good predictor negatively of </v>
<v Speaker 2>divorce.</v>

5
00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.770
<v Speaker 2>So I'm more conscientious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are less likely to get divorced.</v>

6
00:00:29.771 --> 00:00:33.130
<v Speaker 2>It's a really good predictor of grades.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a decent predictor of income.</v>

7
00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.670
<v Speaker 2>It's a good predictor of social status,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eventual social status.</v>

8
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.940
<v Speaker 2>It seems to be particularly good at </v>
<v Speaker 2>predicting</v>

9
00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:42.363
<v Speaker 2>outcomes for people who are engaged in </v>
<v Speaker 2>managerial administrative and process </v>

10
00:00:47.201 --> 00:00:48.034
<v Speaker 2>management occupations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so all of those occupations are </v>

11
00:00:53.831 --> 00:00:56.800
<v Speaker 2>characterized by the necessity of </v>
<v Speaker 2>reliability,</v>

12
00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.220
<v Speaker 2>integrity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

13
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.280
<v Speaker 2>attention to detail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not associated with creativity,</v>

14
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.260
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's openness.</v>

15
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.500
<v Speaker 2>So the open people are better artists </v>
<v Speaker 2>and entrepreneurs by all appearances.</v>

16
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.933
<v Speaker 2>So</v>
<v Speaker 2>all together conscientiousness seems to </v>

17
00:01:19.601 --> 00:01:20.434
<v Speaker 2>be relatively positive trait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then you might wonder why there </v>

18
00:01:24.501 --> 00:01:25.750
<v Speaker 2>was a distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

19
00:01:25.751 --> 00:01:29.230
<v Speaker 2>Like why isn't everybody hyper </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientious?</v>

20
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.500
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it appears at least in part that as with</v>

21
00:01:34.751 --> 00:01:35.584
<v Speaker 2>all the other personality dimensions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's increasing price to be paid as </v>

22
00:01:39.281 --> 00:01:44.110
<v Speaker 2>you deviate from the average.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so unconscientious people,</v>

23
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.130
<v Speaker 2>they tend to rely on others to support </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

24
00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.820
<v Speaker 2>They're not particularly ambitious or </v>
<v Speaker 2>reliable.</v>

25
00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:55.773
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

26
00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.700
<v Speaker 2>But they're not particularly rigid </v>
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>

27
00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.080
<v Speaker 2>And so one possibility might be that low</v>
<v Speaker 2>levels of conscientiousness are an asset</v>

28
00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.840
<v Speaker 2>at certain times when combined with </v>
<v Speaker 2>other traits.</v>

29
00:02:07.841 --> 00:02:12.841
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the data isn't all in on this yet,</v>

30
00:02:13.031 --> 00:02:17.620
<v Speaker 2>but it seems to me quite likely that </v>
<v Speaker 2>orderliness,</v>

31
00:02:17.621 --> 00:02:18.454
<v Speaker 2>which is an aspect of conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness breaks down into </v>

32
00:02:22.001 --> 00:02:22.834
<v Speaker 2>orderliness and industriousness and </v>
<v Speaker 2>those actually seem to be importantly </v>

33
00:02:27.881 --> 00:02:28.714
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think orderliness probably puts an </v>

34
00:02:31.511 --> 00:02:34.370
<v Speaker 2>additional constraint on creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

35
00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.950
<v Speaker 2>So we've studied entrepreneurs for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>long time and uh,</v>

36
00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:41.613
<v Speaker 2>it's clear that higher levels of </v>
<v Speaker 2>orderliness certainly aren't associated </v>

37
00:02:44.801 --> 00:02:47.140
<v Speaker 2>with entrepreneur entrepreneurial </v>
<v Speaker 2>capacity.</v>

38
00:02:47.141 --> 00:02:51.540
<v Speaker 2>And I have the sneaking suspicion that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's because you know,</v>

39
00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:52.383
<v Speaker 2>orderly people are very concerned with </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing whatever needs to be done in the </v>

40
00:02:56.021 --> 00:02:58.240
<v Speaker 2>particular way that it's supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>

41
00:02:58.241 --> 00:03:02.050
<v Speaker 2>And the with that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that if you're a creative,</v>

42
00:03:02.051 --> 00:03:04.150
<v Speaker 2>so if you're engaged in a creative </v>
<v Speaker 2>enterprise,</v>

43
00:03:04.151 --> 00:03:05.980
<v Speaker 2>the thing flips around on you a lot.</v>

44
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.210
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a lot of transformations as</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're moving towards the end and that's</v>

45
00:03:10.211 --> 00:03:13.150
<v Speaker 2>not exactly something in orderly person </v>
<v Speaker 2>is going to appreciate.</v>

46
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.750
<v Speaker 2>I also suspect that orderly people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>likely to,</v>

47
00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.600
<v Speaker 2>there are two likely to obey rules to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>entrepreneurial or creative.</v>

48
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.180
<v Speaker 2>Now obviously obeying rules has its </v>
<v Speaker 2>utility,</v>

49
00:03:25.181 --> 00:03:26.140
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it doesn't,</v>

50
00:03:26.141 --> 00:03:26.974
<v Speaker 2>when the rules are wrong or when they </v>
<v Speaker 2>start to interfere with something that </v>

51
00:03:29.831 --> 00:03:34.360
<v Speaker 2>might be conceptualized as higher a </v>
<v Speaker 2>higher value than the rules themselves.</v>

52
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:36.243
<v Speaker 2>For conscientious people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not self evident that there are </v>

53
00:03:39.101 --> 00:03:43.300
<v Speaker 2>more important values than following the</v>
<v Speaker 2>rules and doing things properly.</v>

54
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.180
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

55
00:03:46.181 --> 00:03:47.014
<v Speaker 2>that's part of what makes them reliable </v>
<v Speaker 2>workers and decent citizens and all of </v>

56
00:03:49.901 --> 00:03:50.734
<v Speaker 2>that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also partly what tips them towards </v>

57
00:03:52.751 --> 00:03:53.584
<v Speaker 2>conservatism on the political spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the best predictors of political </v>

58
00:03:57.011 --> 00:04:01.150
<v Speaker 2>conservatism are low openness and high </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness,</v>

59
00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.193
<v Speaker 2>particularly orderliness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So actually liberals and conservatives </v>

60
00:04:05.261 --> 00:04:08.920
<v Speaker 2>don't seem to be much different than one</v>
<v Speaker 2>another in terms of industriousness,</v>

61
00:04:08.921 --> 00:04:12.910
<v Speaker 2>but they're quite markedly different in </v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of orderliness or,</v>

62
00:04:12.911 --> 00:04:13.691
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could say,</v>

63
00:04:13.691 --> 00:04:14.524
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what predicts liberalism is high </v>

64
00:04:15.461 --> 00:04:18.640
<v Speaker 2>openness and low conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly orderliness,</v>

65
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.853
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you don't necessarily have to </v>

66
00:04:21.131 --> 00:04:25.000
<v Speaker 2>just be predicting con conservatism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

67
00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:28.643
<v Speaker 1>now</v>

68
00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.843
<v Speaker 2>you remember the big two model.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So conscientiousness lumps in with </v>

69
00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.010
<v Speaker 2>emotional stability and agreeableness to</v>
<v Speaker 2>produce stability.</v>

70
00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.430
<v Speaker 2>And as people age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they become more stable,</v>

71
00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:44.293
<v Speaker 2>they become more conscientious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more emotionally stable and more </v>

72
00:04:46.131 --> 00:04:47.360
<v Speaker 2>agreeable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

73
00:04:47.361 --> 00:04:48.194
<v Speaker 2>you probably interpret that somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 2>pleasantly as an improvement in </v>

74
00:04:51.231 --> 00:04:52.064
<v Speaker 2>maturity.</v>

75
00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:53.423
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

76
00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.280
<v Speaker 2>and conscientiousness is quite highly </v>
<v Speaker 2>correlated with neuroticism negatively.</v>

77
00:04:59.281 --> 00:05:02.700
<v Speaker 2>So it turns out generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the more conscientious you are,</v>

78
00:05:02.701 --> 00:05:05.750
<v Speaker 2>the less neurotic you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we,</v>

79
00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:06.773
<v Speaker 2>we think that that might be actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of the tendency of </v>

80
00:05:08.911 --> 00:05:13.911
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness as a trait manifested </v>
<v Speaker 2>across time to stabilize environments.</v>

81
00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.610
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you're a conscientious person,</v>

82
00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.040
<v Speaker 2>imagine that because you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientious,</v>

83
00:05:20.041 --> 00:05:20.874
<v Speaker 2>but not perfectionistic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say you stay on top of your </v>

84
00:05:24.241 --> 00:05:27.180
<v Speaker 2>homework and you get your assignments </v>
<v Speaker 2>done,</v>

85
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.180
<v Speaker 2>let's even say ahead of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

86
00:05:30.181 --> 00:05:31.014
<v Speaker 2>partly what that means is that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount that you have to worry about how </v>

87
00:05:34.741 --> 00:05:35.574
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be doing decreases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course if you're conscientious </v>

88
00:05:38.511 --> 00:05:39.344
<v Speaker 2>and over time your field of </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunities opens up from an </v>

89
00:05:43.981 --> 00:05:44.814
<v Speaker 2>employment perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>plus your income increases and you've </v>

90
00:05:47.191 --> 00:05:48.024
<v Speaker 2>stabilized the environment around you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's less uncertainty in it </v>

91
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:52.500
<v Speaker 2>and more security.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

92
00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:54.023
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could easily be that </v>

93
00:05:54.451 --> 00:05:57.000
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness has its effect on </v>
<v Speaker 2>neuroticism,</v>

94
00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.060
<v Speaker 2>stabilizing the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking the uncertainty out of it,</v>

95
00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.193
<v Speaker 2>and then making people not so much </v>
<v Speaker 2>really less like lower in neuroticism </v>

96
00:06:05.701 --> 00:06:09.060
<v Speaker 2>but just less likely to be anxious and </v>
<v Speaker 2>in emotional pain in general.</v>

97
00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:10.523
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

98
00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.490
<v Speaker 2>so here's some distinctions between </v>
<v Speaker 2>orderliness and industriousness.</v>

99
00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:22.240
<v Speaker 2>You guys can decide where you fit on </v>
<v Speaker 2>these.</v>

100
00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:23.373
<v Speaker 2>So if you're orderly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't leave your belongings around </v>

101
00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:29.010
<v Speaker 2>you like order,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's I'm surprised at one,</v>

102
00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:32.590
<v Speaker 2>you keep things tidy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you follow a schedule,</v>

103
00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.010
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

104
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.850
<v Speaker 2>you're bothered by messy people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want everything to be just right.</v>

105
00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.370
<v Speaker 2>You're bothered by disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>

106
00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:41.930
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you like routine,</v>

107
00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:46.430
<v Speaker 2>you see that rules are observed and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want every detail taken care of.</v>

108
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.190
<v Speaker 2>So the other thing you can kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand likely is the door.</v>

109
00:06:49.191 --> 00:06:50.750
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people aren't that much fun,</v>

110
00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.870
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I also think that's relevant because</v>

111
00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:55.093
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people have different kinds of social </v>

112
00:06:56.601 --> 00:06:57.500
<v Speaker 2>value,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

113
00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:01.550
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes you value people because </v>
<v Speaker 2>of their ability to contribute,</v>

114
00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:05.330
<v Speaker 2>perhaps from an economic perspective </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're hard workers and they're</v>

115
00:07:05.331 --> 00:07:06.590
<v Speaker 2>productive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

116
00:07:06.591 --> 00:07:07.424
<v Speaker 2>when you think about Comedians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedians have a fairly high social </v>

117
00:07:10.221 --> 00:07:13.430
<v Speaker 2>value as far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the probability that they're orderly</v>

118
00:07:13.431 --> 00:07:15.950
<v Speaker 2>as a class is pretty much zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

119
00:07:15.951 --> 00:07:20.951
<v Speaker 2>people are high in high in extroversion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clearly low in agreeableness,</v>

120
00:07:22.011 --> 00:07:22.844
<v Speaker 2>generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're just not going to make </v>

121
00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:28.250
<v Speaker 2>rude comments about people to get alive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what comedians do.</v>

122
00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:29.083
<v Speaker 2>At least 50% of the time unless you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>disagreeable and they have to be pretty </v>

123
00:07:32.511 --> 00:07:37.511
<v Speaker 2>low in conscientiousness because like </v>
<v Speaker 2>really a conscientious comedian,</v>

124
00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:38.743
<v Speaker 2>is this just not going to happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The lifestyle doesn't lend itself to </v>

125
00:07:41.211 --> 00:07:41.721
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

126
00:07:41.721 --> 00:07:43.130
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's erratic.</v>

127
00:07:43.131 --> 00:07:43.964
<v Speaker 2>Your employment is going to be erratic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The probability that you're going to be </v>

128
00:07:45.861 --> 00:07:48.500
<v Speaker 2>regularly employed is low.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're up at night all the time.</v>

129
00:07:48.501 --> 00:07:50.380
<v Speaker 2>You're always partying because that </v>
<v Speaker 2>would go,</v>

130
00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:51.950
<v Speaker 2>that's the meal you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're in,</v>

131
00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.670
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

132
00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:55.460
<v Speaker 2>and then you might,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

133
00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:59.180
<v Speaker 2>you might think the same about people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who are artistic performers,</v>

134
00:07:59.181 --> 00:08:00.320
<v Speaker 2>like musicians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

135
00:08:00.321 --> 00:08:02.360
<v Speaker 2>if you want to be a rock musician for </v>
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>

136
00:08:02.361 --> 00:08:03.194
<v Speaker 2>when you're a teenager,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course that makes you just a typical </v>

137
00:08:04.971 --> 00:08:05.804
<v Speaker 2>teenager in some ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you're going to pursue that into </v>

138
00:08:08.421 --> 00:08:09.254
<v Speaker 2>adulthood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of many more stable </v>

139
00:08:11.001 --> 00:08:13.130
<v Speaker 2>occupations that you have to forego.</v>

140
00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:15.440
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you have to be willing to adopt the</v>

141
00:08:15.441 --> 00:08:19.430
<v Speaker 2>route of erratic and unpredictable </v>
<v Speaker 2>lifestyle that would go along with being</v>

142
00:08:19.431 --> 00:08:20.264
<v Speaker 2>say a traveling musician.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that also has to not make you feel </v>

143
00:08:22.881 --> 00:08:24.230
<v Speaker 2>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

144
00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:28.430
<v Speaker 2>we don't exactly know what makes people </v>
<v Speaker 2>industrious or,</v>

145
00:08:28.431 --> 00:08:29.264
<v Speaker 2>or conscientious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but avoiding feeling bad seems to be </v>

146
00:08:33.471 --> 00:08:37.230
<v Speaker 2>some seems to have something to do with </v>
<v Speaker 2>it except that it's complicated.</v>

147
00:08:37.231 --> 00:08:38.064
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the hypothesis fundamentally </v>

148
00:08:39.801 --> 00:08:40.634
<v Speaker 2>behind the big five traits analysis is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that all the negative emotions load </v>

149
00:08:43.611 --> 00:08:45.320
<v Speaker 2>together on a single factor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

150
00:08:45.321 --> 00:08:49.520
<v Speaker 2>So that's fundamentally neuroticism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then you might say,</v>

151
00:08:49.521 --> 00:08:50.354
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's neuroticism that all the </v>

152
00:08:51.471 --> 00:08:52.304
<v Speaker 2>negative emotions are loading on what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>left over for the conscientious people </v>

153
00:08:55.621 --> 00:08:56.454
<v Speaker 2>to use to feel bad with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we think that conscientiousness </v>

154
00:09:01.531 --> 00:09:02.364
<v Speaker 2>isn't a well understood dementia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's understood from a measurement </v>

155
00:09:06.931 --> 00:09:08.820
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can measure it quite accurately,</v>

156
00:09:08.821 --> 00:09:09.654
<v Speaker 2>but mostly only using questionnaires,</v>
<v Speaker 2>either self report or other persons a </v>

157
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:13.950
<v Speaker 2>report.</v>

158
00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:14.783
<v Speaker 2>We don't have any direct measures of </v>
<v Speaker 2>industriousness and so and so that's </v>

159
00:09:19.981 --> 00:09:24.060
<v Speaker 2>kind of strange because it's such a </v>
<v Speaker 2>potent phenomena that you think that you</v>

160
00:09:24.061 --> 00:09:27.570
<v Speaker 2>could come up with lab tasks that </v>
<v Speaker 2>industrious people for example,</v>

161
00:09:27.571 --> 00:09:30.480
<v Speaker 2>would do a better job that than non </v>
<v Speaker 2>industrious people,</v>

162
00:09:30.481 --> 00:09:34.440
<v Speaker 2>but we haven't been able to identify one</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we probably screamed 50 years,</v>

163
00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:38.310
<v Speaker 2>50 to 75 different tasks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never got any effect at all.</v>

164
00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.193
<v Speaker 2>With orderliness though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've had more luck because what </v>

165
00:09:42.811 --> 00:09:47.811
<v Speaker 2>orderliness seems to be associated with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although not overwhelmingly powerfully,</v>

166
00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:53.130
<v Speaker 2>is disgust,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sensitivity and so discussed seems to be</v>

167
00:09:53.131 --> 00:09:58.131
<v Speaker 2>an emotional axis that's distinct to </v>
<v Speaker 2>some degree from neuroticism.</v>

168
00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:00.300
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might say,</v>

169
00:10:00.301 --> 00:10:01.530
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the disgusting things,</v>

170
00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:03.480
<v Speaker 2>if you're too close to a disgusting </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

171
00:10:03.481 --> 00:10:06.720
<v Speaker 2>you'd also get anxious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's probably true,</v>

172
00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:07.793
<v Speaker 2>but the emotion of disgust isn't the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same as the emotion of anxiety or the </v>

173
00:10:11.761 --> 00:10:13.500
<v Speaker 2>emotion of pain.</v>

174
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:18.690
<v Speaker 2>Disgust is a revulsion emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a getaway from me emotion.</v>

175
00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:21.420
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's an emotion that will </v>
<v Speaker 2>elicit anger,</v>

176
00:10:21.421 --> 00:10:22.254
<v Speaker 2>defensive anger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to push something disgusting the way or </v>

177
00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:28.200
<v Speaker 2>to be contemptuous of it or to roll your</v>
<v Speaker 2>eyes at it.</v>

178
00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:31.650
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's an interesting little fact.</v>

179
00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:36.750
<v Speaker 2>One of the best predictors of impending </v>
<v Speaker 2>divorce is eye rolling.</v>

180
00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:40.890
<v Speaker 2>So if you have a couple in therapy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you notice that when one talks,</v>

181
00:10:40.891 --> 00:10:44.640
<v Speaker 2>the other rolls their eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that that's just not very good.</v>

182
00:10:44.641 --> 00:10:47.040
<v Speaker 2>So that's something to remember in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>own relationships.</v>

183
00:10:47.041 --> 00:10:49.020
<v Speaker 2>If you're starting to roll your eyes at </v>
<v Speaker 2>your partner,</v>

184
00:10:49.021 --> 00:10:50.100
<v Speaker 2>you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

185
00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:51.263
<v Speaker 2>that's a contemporary response.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a disgust response if you're </v>

186
00:10:54.091 --> 00:10:57.030
<v Speaker 2>starting to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's either time to stop or time to</v>

187
00:10:57.031 --> 00:10:59.850
<v Speaker 2>start looking for a new partner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

188
00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:02.513
<v Speaker 2>now the orderliness discussed connection</v>
<v Speaker 2>turns out to be theoretically extremely </v>

189
00:11:06.631 --> 00:11:07.464
<v Speaker 2>interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're going to talk about that in </v>

190
00:11:08.341 --> 00:11:09.930
<v Speaker 2>some detail as we move forward.</v>

191
00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:12.300
<v Speaker 2>But I'll go through industriousness </v>
<v Speaker 2>next.</v>

192
00:11:12.301 --> 00:11:16.380
<v Speaker 2>And so an industrious person carries out</v>
<v Speaker 2>their plans.</v>

193
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:20.010
<v Speaker 2>Now that might be the critical element </v>
<v Speaker 2>of industriousness.</v>

194
00:11:20.011 --> 00:11:23.430
<v Speaker 2>So if you look at the general </v>
<v Speaker 2>neuropsychological literature,</v>

195
00:11:23.431 --> 00:11:24.264
<v Speaker 2>what you generally derived from that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the prefrontal cortex is involved </v>

196
00:11:28.441 --> 00:11:31.470
<v Speaker 2>in behavioral regulation because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>prefrontal Cortex is the,</v>

197
00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:35.400
<v Speaker 2>is the part of the brain that people use</v>
<v Speaker 2>to generate plans.</v>

198
00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:40.700
<v Speaker 2>And dorsolateral prefrontal cortical </v>
<v Speaker 2>function is primarily cognitive,</v>

199
00:11:42.481 --> 00:11:44.700
<v Speaker 2>at least in so far as we've been able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>measure it.</v>

200
00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:45.953
<v Speaker 2>And the cognitive abilities of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex appear </v>

201
00:11:49.481 --> 00:11:52.890
<v Speaker 2>to be quite tightly linked to fluid </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence as we discussed before.</v>

202
00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:54.123
<v Speaker 2>And so it also stands to reason to some </v>
<v Speaker 2>degree that your ability to plan and </v>

203
00:11:57.761 --> 00:11:58.594
<v Speaker 2>your intelligence might be associated </v>
<v Speaker 2>with your ability to carry out your </v>

204
00:12:02.531 --> 00:12:07.531
<v Speaker 2>plans are not to waste time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The cortex overall has been viewed as an</v>

205
00:12:07.571 --> 00:12:09.550
<v Speaker 2>organ that inhibits impulsivity.</v>

206
00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:12.190
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as we've discussed,</v>

207
00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:13.323
<v Speaker 2>the idea that impulsivity is inhibited </v>
<v Speaker 2>is probably not the world's most </v>

208
00:12:17.111 --> 00:12:17.944
<v Speaker 2>sophisticated idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably more that impulsivity is </v>

209
00:12:21.041 --> 00:12:21.874
<v Speaker 2>unnecessary if you've developed a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sufficiently sophisticated personality </v>

210
00:12:25.721 --> 00:12:26.554
<v Speaker 2>because you can get what you need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have through more complex and </v>

211
00:12:29.261 --> 00:12:31.540
<v Speaker 2>sophisticated means with less social </v>
<v Speaker 2>conflict.</v>

212
00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:34.870
<v Speaker 2>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this idea that's been maintained</v>

213
00:12:34.871 --> 00:12:37.930
<v Speaker 2>in the neuropsychological literature for</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very long time,</v>

214
00:12:37.931 --> 00:12:42.931
<v Speaker 2>that the ability to plan is associated </v>
<v Speaker 2>with increased control over impulsivity.</v>

215
00:12:44.891 --> 00:12:47.890
<v Speaker 2>But the problem with that theory is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't seem to be true.</v>

216
00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:52.810
<v Speaker 2>So there's no correlation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The correlation between intelligence and</v>

217
00:12:52.811 --> 00:12:56.770
<v Speaker 2>industriousness is zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's weird because man,</v>

218
00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.020
<v Speaker 2>if you take intelligence and correlate </v>
<v Speaker 2>it with something,</v>

219
00:12:59.021 --> 00:13:01.420
<v Speaker 2>it's correlated with almost everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

220
00:13:01.421 --> 00:13:05.470
<v Speaker 2>So even disgust sensitivity if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we measured this test sensitivity and</v>

221
00:13:05.471 --> 00:13:08.890
<v Speaker 2>there's a variety of ways of doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we find is more intelligent,</v>

222
00:13:08.891 --> 00:13:10.900
<v Speaker 2>people are less disgust sensitive.</v>

223
00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:12.640
<v Speaker 2>So even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

224
00:13:12.641 --> 00:13:15.190
<v Speaker 2>the connection there is by no means </v>
<v Speaker 2>obvious,</v>

225
00:13:15.191 --> 00:13:16.024
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you could just as easily think </v>

226
00:13:17.021 --> 00:13:21.070
<v Speaker 2>that intelligent people would be less or</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be more disgusted sensitive.</v>

227
00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:24.310
<v Speaker 2>But that hasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that isn't how it is now.</v>

228
00:13:24.311 --> 00:13:25.144
<v Speaker 2>The idea of carrying out your plans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an interesting one because </v>

229
00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:31.060
<v Speaker 2>imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about what cognition is like,</v>

230
00:13:31.061 --> 00:13:34.480
<v Speaker 2>especially abstract cognition of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind that we were talking about last,</v>

231
00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:35.660
<v Speaker 2>last,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

232
00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:39.250
<v Speaker 2>last class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In order to abstract,</v>

233
00:13:39.251 --> 00:13:44.251
<v Speaker 2>you have to separate the objects of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>internal manipulation from the world,</v>

234
00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:47.050
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here,</v>

235
00:13:47.051 --> 00:13:49.420
<v Speaker 2>here's an example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you go to sleep at night,</v>

236
00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:52.480
<v Speaker 2>there's a little switch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for lack of a better term,</v>

237
00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:53.763
<v Speaker 2>that shuts your body down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what happens is that when you're </v>

238
00:13:57.731 --> 00:13:58.564
<v Speaker 2>dreaming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course you're dreaming about running </v>

239
00:13:59.531 --> 00:14:02.710
<v Speaker 2>around and you move your eyes while </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're dreaming.</v>

240
00:14:02.711 --> 00:14:03.544
<v Speaker 2>Now it turns out that the motor systems </v>
<v Speaker 2>that control your eyes aren't shutdown </v>

241
00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:07.360
<v Speaker 2>because who cares?</v>

242
00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:09.610
<v Speaker 2>You can move your eyes and still be in </v>
<v Speaker 2>bed asleep,</v>

243
00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:10.503
<v Speaker 2>not running around in your dream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you take a cat or another animal </v>

244
00:14:13.961 --> 00:14:14.794
<v Speaker 2>and you destroy that off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>switch the capitol run around and act </v>

245
00:14:19.301 --> 00:14:21.490
<v Speaker 2>out its dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay?</v>

246
00:14:21.491 --> 00:14:23.950
<v Speaker 2>So it's thinking is linked to its </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior.</v>

247
00:14:23.951 --> 00:14:26.140
<v Speaker 2>So integrity that when it runs a </v>
<v Speaker 2>simulation,</v>

248
00:14:26.141 --> 00:14:27.760
<v Speaker 2>it's going to act it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

249
00:14:27.761 --> 00:14:28.594
<v Speaker 2>human beings don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happens when we think or we often </v>

250
00:14:31.931 --> 00:14:32.764
<v Speaker 2>don't do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are times when we can avoid doing </v>

251
00:14:35.141 --> 00:14:36.550
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

252
00:14:36.551 --> 00:14:37.384
<v Speaker 2>when you think you sit there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you generate up your world of </v>

253
00:14:39.491 --> 00:14:40.324
<v Speaker 2>abstraction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have your abstract representations </v>

254
00:14:42.701 --> 00:14:44.410
<v Speaker 2>and you manipulate them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you might think,</v>

255
00:14:44.411 --> 00:14:46.390
<v Speaker 2>well this is what I'm going to do to </v>
<v Speaker 2>tomorrow.</v>

256
00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:47.373
<v Speaker 2>You run a simulation in your head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you wouldn't be able to do that if </v>

257
00:14:50.051 --> 00:14:54.410
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't pull the simulated you away</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the actual view,</v>

258
00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:54.680
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

259
00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:55.513
<v Speaker 2>You have to divorce the representation </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the thing it's representing in </v>

260
00:14:58.521 --> 00:14:59.354
<v Speaker 2>order to manipulate it abstractly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that opens up the possibility that </v>

261
00:15:02.901 --> 00:15:07.670
<v Speaker 2>you can think through things perfectly </v>
<v Speaker 2>well without ever enacting your plans.</v>

262
00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:11.720
<v Speaker 2>And that's actually what you see in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>therapeutic realm.</v>

263
00:15:11.721 --> 00:15:15.140
<v Speaker 2>If you have a client who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>unconscientious,</v>

264
00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:16.723
<v Speaker 2>you've got a real problem because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>person won't do anything that they say </v>

265
00:15:19.941 --> 00:15:21.380
<v Speaker 2>they're going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

266
00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:23.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>generally speaking,</v>

267
00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:25.213
<v Speaker 2>especially for behavioral therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens is that someone will come </v>

268
00:15:27.591 --> 00:15:28.424
<v Speaker 2>in with a problem and you discuss an </v>
<v Speaker 2>array of potential solutions and you </v>

269
00:15:32.541 --> 00:15:33.374
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an intelligent person could do that </v>

270
00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:35.773
<v Speaker 2>better than an unintelligent person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you decide which of those </v>

271
00:15:39.561 --> 00:15:41.780
<v Speaker 2>potential solutions might be </v>
<v Speaker 2>implemented.</v>

272
00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:44.270
<v Speaker 2>And then you wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

273
00:15:44.271 --> 00:15:47.390
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to put too much of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>burden on the person because you want to</v>

274
00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:52.160
<v Speaker 2>make the probability that they'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually implement the change very high.</v>

275
00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:52.993
<v Speaker 2>So you do it quite slowly because people</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't that good at implementing </v>

276
00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:58.340
<v Speaker 2>behavioral changes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

277
00:15:58.370 --> 00:15:59.203
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hopefully the person comes back and </v>

278
00:16:00.021 --> 00:16:00.441
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

279
00:16:00.441 --> 00:16:04.100
<v Speaker 2>I've tried this and here's the outcome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you modify it accordingly.</v>

280
00:16:04.101 --> 00:16:04.934
<v Speaker 2>It's got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's called essentially called </v>

281
00:16:05.901 --> 00:16:08.080
<v Speaker 2>collaborative empiricism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

282
00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:09.913
<v Speaker 2>but the problem with doing that with </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who's unconscientious is that </v>

283
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:13.400
<v Speaker 2>they'll come back and they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

284
00:16:13.401 --> 00:16:14.960
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get around to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

285
00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:15.853
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what are you supposed to do about </v>

286
00:16:16.731 --> 00:16:17.564
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like if the person doesn't get </v>

287
00:16:19.131 --> 00:16:20.960
<v Speaker 2>around to doing things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that'll help.</v>

288
00:16:20.961 --> 00:16:23.930
<v Speaker 2>How can you get them to get around to </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing anything that'll help?</v>

289
00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:24.793
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of those flaws that seems to </v>

290
00:16:26.301 --> 00:16:29.390
<v Speaker 2>interfere with the process itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

291
00:16:29.391 --> 00:16:31.340
<v Speaker 2>Now I could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

292
00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:32.383
<v Speaker 2>maybe you could make the person </v>
<v Speaker 2>enthusiastic about it and they'd be </v>

293
00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:37.580
<v Speaker 2>driven by enthusiasm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is more of a positive emotion.</v>

294
00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:38.413
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe you could terrify them half to </v>
<v Speaker 2>death by the negative consequences of </v>

295
00:16:41.901 --> 00:16:44.270
<v Speaker 2>not doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is also useful.</v>

296
00:16:44.271 --> 00:16:48.470
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe they're agreeable and so they'd</v>
<v Speaker 2>be willing to do it for someone else.</v>

297
00:16:48.471 --> 00:16:50.450
<v Speaker 2>Like there's other places or if they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>open,</v>

298
00:16:50.451 --> 00:16:52.070
<v Speaker 2>you can think of a creative way to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

299
00:16:52.071 --> 00:16:54.110
<v Speaker 2>There's other places you can get </v>
<v Speaker 2>leverage,</v>

300
00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:58.370
<v Speaker 2>but without the conscientiousness </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a real problem.</v>

301
00:16:58.371 --> 00:16:59.930
<v Speaker 2>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really difficult.</v>

302
00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:01.783
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So industriousness seems to be </v>

303
00:17:02.601 --> 00:17:05.540
<v Speaker 2>associated with the ability or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>willingness.</v>

304
00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:06.493
<v Speaker 2>God only knows to take plans that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>formulated and then to implement them </v>

305
00:17:10.101 --> 00:17:10.934
<v Speaker 2>into behavior in [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 2>the voluntarily into behavior and you </v>

306
00:17:15.111 --> 00:17:15.944
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone knows that's a relatively </v>

307
00:17:16.731 --> 00:17:17.960
<v Speaker 2>difficult thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

308
00:17:17.961 --> 00:17:20.810
<v Speaker 2>if you're trying to settle yourself down</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do a task,</v>

309
00:17:20.811 --> 00:17:24.320
<v Speaker 2>especially when you don't want to do so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not enthusiastic about it.</v>

310
00:17:24.321 --> 00:17:25.550
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That can't carry you.</v>

311
00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:28.820
<v Speaker 2>Do you want to settle down and do a task</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're not enthusiastic about?</v>

312
00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:30.680
<v Speaker 2>That takes effort?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

313
00:17:30.681 --> 00:17:31.514
<v Speaker 2>you could say it takes willpower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I actually think the conscientious </v>

314
00:17:34.881 --> 00:17:36.080
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially,</v>

315
00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:39.430
<v Speaker 2>I think especially the orderly person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is an addict,</v>

316
00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:40.573
<v Speaker 2>is a person who admires willpower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that seems to be associated with </v>

317
00:17:44.391 --> 00:17:47.720
<v Speaker 2>something like due to fullness as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a moral construct.</v>

318
00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:48.793
<v Speaker 2>So a conscientious person will do </v>
<v Speaker 2>something because they should do it or </v>

319
00:17:51.181 --> 00:17:52.014
<v Speaker 2>because they have a duty to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's partly also why you see </v>

320
00:17:54.421 --> 00:17:57.210
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness as an element of </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservatism.</v>

321
00:17:57.211 --> 00:17:59.640
<v Speaker 2>Because conservatives tend to be more </v>
<v Speaker 2>patriotic,</v>

322
00:17:59.641 --> 00:18:00.474
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they are more willing to think of </v>

323
00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:07.020
<v Speaker 2>their moral obligation in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>service to the structured community.</v>

324
00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:12.180
<v Speaker 2>Now we just did a factor analysis of </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative belief,</v>

325
00:18:12.181 --> 00:18:13.014
<v Speaker 2>conservative versus liberal belief.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of my students is presenting </v>

326
00:18:15.571 --> 00:18:17.100
<v Speaker 2>that for her phd defense.</v>

327
00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:20.960
<v Speaker 2>We took a long time to do it about four </v>
<v Speaker 2>years to really get the measures down.</v>

328
00:18:20.961 --> 00:18:21.794
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hear about social conservative than </v>

329
00:18:23.491 --> 00:18:27.450
<v Speaker 2>fiscal social conservatism and fiscal </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservatism,</v>

330
00:18:27.451 --> 00:18:29.100
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the social conservatives,</v>

331
00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:32.220
<v Speaker 2>conservatives are usually in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the states,</v>

332
00:18:32.221 --> 00:18:34.470
<v Speaker 2>they're prolife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

333
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:37.200
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

334
00:18:37.201 --> 00:18:38.034
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're usually not fans of gay </v>

335
00:18:39.691 --> 00:18:41.580
<v Speaker 2>marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>

336
00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:43.711
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

337
00:18:43.711 --> 00:18:46.860
<v Speaker 2>they're not advocates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Generally speaking of a welfare state,</v>

338
00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:51.640
<v Speaker 2>they're against single parent families </v>
<v Speaker 2>or that,</v>

339
00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:53.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's all social conservative.</v>

340
00:18:53.721 --> 00:18:55.170
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a moral,</v>

341
00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:56.243
<v Speaker 2>it's a moral dimension of belief.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas fiscal conservativism is </v>

342
00:18:59.041 --> 00:19:01.400
<v Speaker 2>something like don't run deficits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

343
00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:03.960
<v Speaker 2>if you want it to put it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>simply don't spend,</v>

344
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:06.780
<v Speaker 2>the government shouldn't spend any more </v>
<v Speaker 2>money a than it has.</v>

345
00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:07.693
<v Speaker 2>And so that's an important principle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it also isn't an agent of economic </v>

346
00:19:12.151 --> 00:19:13.710
<v Speaker 2>development.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not really seen that way.</v>

347
00:19:13.711 --> 00:19:15.540
<v Speaker 2>They're more like minimal government </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

348
00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:19.560
<v Speaker 2>but we got no evidence for a split </v>
<v Speaker 2>between fiscal and social conservatism.</v>

349
00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:20.393
<v Speaker 2>So I don't think it exists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just a media invention </v>

350
00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:24.153
<v Speaker 2>because we did construct validation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the sort that I've been talking to you </v>

351
00:19:26.491 --> 00:19:29.280
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we got instead were three factors.</v>

352
00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:31.073
<v Speaker 2>We got masculine independence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what we decided to call it </v>

353
00:19:34.291 --> 00:19:36.270
<v Speaker 2>because it was much more common among </v>
<v Speaker 2>men.</v>

354
00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:38.520
<v Speaker 2>And it kind of looked like </v>
<v Speaker 2>libertarianism,</v>

355
00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:39.953
<v Speaker 2>which is a brand of conservatism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is basically you go and do your </v>

356
00:19:42.931 --> 00:19:43.764
<v Speaker 2>bloody thing and I'll do my thing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll either leave each other alone or </v>

357
00:19:46.441 --> 00:19:47.274
<v Speaker 2>if we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll compete and one of us can win and </v>

358
00:19:48.481 --> 00:19:51.420
<v Speaker 2>that'll be just fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it looked like,</v>

359
00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:54.150
<v Speaker 2>so one of the things that's interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>about that,</v>

360
00:19:54.151 --> 00:19:57.420
<v Speaker 2>and it really got me thinking was that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

361
00:19:58.260 --> 00:19:59.093
<v Speaker 2>that classic explanation for why </v>
<v Speaker 2>Conservatives are conservative is </v>

362
00:20:02.161 --> 00:20:04.560
<v Speaker 2>because they're afraid of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're afraid,</v>

363
00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:06.240
<v Speaker 2>but there's just no evidence for that.</v>

364
00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:09.870
<v Speaker 2>Conservatives are less neurotic than </v>
<v Speaker 2>liberals by a substantial margin.</v>

365
00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:11.093
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is evidence that they have a </v>

366
00:20:12.301 --> 00:20:15.630
<v Speaker 2>negativity bias,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I don't really want to explain,</v>

367
00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:16.643
<v Speaker 2>but what that means sometimes is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll actually pay more attention to </v>

368
00:20:19.351 --> 00:20:22.600
<v Speaker 2>negative information rather than less in</v>
<v Speaker 2>comparison to liberal.</v>

369
00:20:22.601 --> 00:20:27.210
<v Speaker 2>So what it means is not clear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the masculine independence dimension</v>

370
00:20:27.211 --> 00:20:28.044
<v Speaker 2>is a very interesting one because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>implies that there's a reason for </v>

371
00:20:30.781 --> 00:20:31.614
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy beyond structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't win unless you play a </v>

372
00:20:34.981 --> 00:20:35.814
<v Speaker 2>structure game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know what a lot of what the </v>

373
00:20:38.401 --> 00:20:39.234
<v Speaker 2>masculine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>independent types want is they want to </v>

374
00:20:40.771 --> 00:20:44.430
<v Speaker 2>say just get the damn rules straight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really care what they are,</v>

375
00:20:44.431 --> 00:20:46.440
<v Speaker 2>but if you get them straight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all follow them.</v>

376
00:20:46.441 --> 00:20:48.550
<v Speaker 2>But that'll so hierarchy because that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

377
00:20:48.551 --> 00:20:50.160
<v Speaker 2>as soon as you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's approved,</v>

378
00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:51.043
<v Speaker 2>produced a value structure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you produce a hierarchy because people </v>

379
00:20:53.741 --> 00:20:55.950
<v Speaker 2>compete towards fulfilling the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

380
00:20:56.050 --> 00:20:59.780
<v Speaker 2>they compete towards the end game and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that'll immediately produced a hierarchy</v>

381
00:20:59.781 --> 00:21:01.330
<v Speaker 2>out of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

382
00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:02.710
<v Speaker 2>accomplishment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>

383
00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:04.210
<v Speaker 2>And then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

384
00:21:04.211 --> 00:21:07.360
<v Speaker 2>why would men be particularly motivated </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do that?</v>

385
00:21:07.361 --> 00:21:08.194
<v Speaker 2>And the answer seems to be because of </v>
<v Speaker 2>hyper gummy and hypergo b is the </v>

386
00:21:10.421 --> 00:21:13.900
<v Speaker 2>tendency of women to make across her up </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominance hierarchies.</v>

387
00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:14.943
<v Speaker 2>So the males compete with one another </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they want to because they want to </v>

388
00:21:17.531 --> 00:21:18.364
<v Speaker 2>win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] and part of the consequence </v>

389
00:21:19.571 --> 00:21:23.110
<v Speaker 2>of winning is that they have much more </v>
<v Speaker 2>success with women.</v>

390
00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:25.450
<v Speaker 2>And that's a primary motivator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

391
00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:27.420
<v Speaker 2>so that's interesting because it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

392
00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:32.650
<v Speaker 2>it provides a rationale for supporting a</v>
<v Speaker 2>relatively structured hierarchy that has</v>

393
00:21:32.711 --> 00:21:34.560
<v Speaker 2>nothing to do with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

394
00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:35.703
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having to deal with the negative </v>

395
00:21:37.211 --> 00:21:40.810
<v Speaker 2>consequences of not having a stable </v>
<v Speaker 2>worldview.</v>

396
00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:41.950
<v Speaker 2>It's more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

397
00:21:41.951 --> 00:21:44.860
<v Speaker 2>there's another thing to think about to </v>
<v Speaker 2>hear with regards to hierarchies.</v>

398
00:21:44.861 --> 00:21:49.390
<v Speaker 2>It's like</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have an ideal,</v>

399
00:21:49.391 --> 00:21:52.420
<v Speaker 2>you immediately have a hierarch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you,</v>

400
00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:53.313
<v Speaker 2>because of course let's say that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a bunch of children and gymnasium </v>

401
00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:57.513
<v Speaker 2>and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well let's do somersaults to the other </v>

402
00:22:00.101 --> 00:22:01.300
<v Speaker 2>side of the wall.</v>

403
00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:02.313
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an implication there and the </v>

404
00:22:03.191 --> 00:22:05.790
<v Speaker 2>implication is that you can be better or</v>
<v Speaker 2>worse at it.</v>

405
00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:06.673
<v Speaker 2>So the kids will immediately compete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially the boys immediately compete </v>

406
00:22:10.031 --> 00:22:13.240
<v Speaker 2>to roll to the other side of the wall as</v>
<v Speaker 2>fast as they possibly can.</v>

407
00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:16.750
<v Speaker 2>And so if you want it to get rid of </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy,</v>

408
00:22:16.751 --> 00:22:17.584
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to get rid of values.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that seems like a really stupid </v>

409
00:22:19.661 --> 00:22:20.890
<v Speaker 2>thing to do to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

410
00:22:20.891 --> 00:22:21.724
<v Speaker 2>because without values,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have no positive motivation because </v>

411
00:22:24.371 --> 00:22:28.090
<v Speaker 2>you feel almost all your positive </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivation in relationship to a goal.</v>

412
00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:29.253
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it's not attainment of the goal </v>

413
00:22:30.701 --> 00:22:32.620
<v Speaker 2>that makes people happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Generally speaking,</v>

414
00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:33.813
<v Speaker 2>it's observation of the fact that their </v>
<v Speaker 2>efforts are contributing to them moving </v>

415
00:22:37.361 --> 00:22:39.730
<v Speaker 2>towards a value goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

416
00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:41.560
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's masculine and independence.</v>

417
00:22:41.561 --> 00:22:42.394
<v Speaker 2>That was one dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another dimension was basically </v>

418
00:22:45.311 --> 00:22:46.144
<v Speaker 2>religious traditionalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there was more women who were </v>

419
00:22:48.401 --> 00:22:49.234
<v Speaker 2>aligned with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was interesting because we found </v>

420
00:22:51.131 --> 00:22:53.350
<v Speaker 2>more women on the far left of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>spectrum too,</v>

421
00:22:53.351 --> 00:22:54.550
<v Speaker 2>which I'll talk about in a minute.</v>

422
00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:57.190
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the last one was something like</v>

423
00:22:57.191 --> 00:22:59.500
<v Speaker 2>ethnocentrism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like,</v>

424
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're not like us,</v>

425
00:23:01.061 --> 00:23:03.310
<v Speaker 2>go away basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

426
00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:05.970
<v Speaker 2>but none of those were fiscal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>social or none of them.</v>

427
00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:09.310
<v Speaker 2>None of those were fiscal or social.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was quite interesting.</v>

428
00:23:09.311 --> 00:23:12.040
<v Speaker 2>And it also shows you the utility of </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting your measurements right.</v>

429
00:23:12.041 --> 00:23:13.960
<v Speaker 2>Because if you don't get your </v>
<v Speaker 2>measurements right,</v>

430
00:23:13.961 --> 00:23:15.430
<v Speaker 2>you don't even know what you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

431
00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:16.503
<v Speaker 2>And conservatism characterized along </v>
<v Speaker 2>those three dimensions is a lot </v>

432
00:23:19.631 --> 00:23:23.380
<v Speaker 2>different than conservative as in </v>
<v Speaker 2>characterized as fiscal versus social.</v>

433
00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:26.530
<v Speaker 2>They're not the same phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

434
00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:29.373
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So back to the industrious person </v>

435
00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:35.230
<v Speaker 2>carries out his or her plants wastes </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

436
00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:38.350
<v Speaker 2>Negative con industrious people don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>waste time.</v>

437
00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:44.610
<v Speaker 2>So they stay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they stay focused on their goal or they,</v>

438
00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:48.650
<v Speaker 2>they continue acting in relationship to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the goal that's more accurate.</v>

439
00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:50.870
<v Speaker 2>Finds it difficult to get down to work.</v>

440
00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:53.060
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that isn't characteristic of industrious</v>

441
00:23:53.061 --> 00:23:55.370
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can see the willpower element to</v>

442
00:23:55.371 --> 00:23:56.510
<v Speaker 2>that to some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

443
00:23:56.511 --> 00:24:01.511
<v Speaker 2>you can tell yourself to sit down and </v>
<v Speaker 2>work and you will so messes things up.</v>

444
00:24:03.441 --> 00:24:04.274
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that isn't what an industrious person </v>

445
00:24:05.661 --> 00:24:07.580
<v Speaker 2>does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Finishes what he or she starts.</v>

446
00:24:07.581 --> 00:24:08.414
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Puts his or her mind on the task at </v>

447
00:24:10.431 --> 00:24:11.264
<v Speaker 2>hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there seems to be an intentional </v>

448
00:24:12.351 --> 00:24:13.700
<v Speaker 2>phenomena there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

449
00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:17.570
<v Speaker 2>Is the person is able to focus in </v>
<v Speaker 2>without distractions.</v>

450
00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:20.060
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets things done quickly.</v>

451
00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:21.133
<v Speaker 2>Well industrious people seem to be fans </v>
<v Speaker 2>of efficiency and you can kind of see </v>

452
00:24:24.621 --> 00:24:26.720
<v Speaker 2>the relationship between efficiency in </v>
<v Speaker 2>order.</v>

453
00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:27.703
<v Speaker 2>Although you can also see at times where</v>
<v Speaker 2>the demand for more efficiency would </v>

454
00:24:30.951 --> 00:24:31.784
<v Speaker 2>require the disruption of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of something that was previously </v>

455
00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:34.933
<v Speaker 2>orderly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So an industrious person and an orderly </v>

456
00:24:36.771 --> 00:24:38.180
<v Speaker 2>person might have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

457
00:24:38.181 --> 00:24:41.510
<v Speaker 2>a dispute about that always knows what </v>
<v Speaker 2>he or she is doing.</v>

458
00:24:41.511 --> 00:24:42.344
<v Speaker 2>So that's again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a kind of certainty and </v>

459
00:24:43.791 --> 00:24:47.330
<v Speaker 2>direction that's associated with that </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't postpone decisions,</v>

460
00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:48.193
<v Speaker 2>isn't easily distract and orderliness is</v>
<v Speaker 2>the big predictor of longterm life </v>

461
00:24:52.821 --> 00:24:53.654
<v Speaker 2>success.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now orderliness is more predictive of </v>

462
00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:57.493
<v Speaker 2>success in jobs that require careful </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention to the management of process </v>

463
00:25:00.591 --> 00:25:01.424
<v Speaker 2>so that if something has become </v>
<v Speaker 2>something has been turned into an </v>

464
00:25:03.771 --> 00:25:06.260
<v Speaker 2>algorithm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that means there's a process by which</v>

465
00:25:06.261 --> 00:25:07.094
<v Speaker 2>it might be done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then in order to be a person is very </v>

466
00:25:09.201 --> 00:25:10.600
<v Speaker 2>good at making sure that the,</v>

467
00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:13.150
<v Speaker 1>that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that,</v>

468
00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:18.330
<v Speaker 2>that the algorithm runs exactly as it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to without error.</v>

469
00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:19.433
<v Speaker 2>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness actually has quite a </v>

470
00:25:20.701 --> 00:25:21.534
<v Speaker 2>good predictor of scientific </v>
<v Speaker 2>productivity because one of the things </v>

471
00:25:24.091 --> 00:25:24.924
<v Speaker 2>that science does in large part is </v>
<v Speaker 2>reduce the reliance on intelligence and </v>

472
00:25:30.811 --> 00:25:33.000
<v Speaker 2>increase the reliance on </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness.</v>

473
00:25:33.001 --> 00:25:34.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's one of its powers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

474
00:25:34.831 --> 00:25:39.030
<v Speaker 2>Because you can be a not spectacularly </v>
<v Speaker 2>bright scientists,</v>

475
00:25:39.031 --> 00:25:39.864
<v Speaker 2>but if you're good at methodology and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're detail oriented and you know the </v>

476
00:25:43.591 --> 00:25:46.320
<v Speaker 2>literature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can figure out what the next problem</v>

477
00:25:46.321 --> 00:25:49.410
<v Speaker 2>is to solve what's micro problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause you know where the problems are.</v>

478
00:25:49.411 --> 00:25:52.560
<v Speaker 2>And then science is like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost like a meat grinder.</v>

479
00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:54.240
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you turn the crank property,</v>

480
00:25:54.241 --> 00:25:56.700
<v Speaker 2>you feed in raw information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you turn the crank property,</v>

481
00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:59.460
<v Speaker 2>you're going to make the next,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

482
00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:00.383
<v Speaker 2>tiny step forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's maybe the more open scientists </v>

483
00:26:03.391 --> 00:26:04.224
<v Speaker 2>to leap way the hell into the future and</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely transform a field at the </v>

484
00:26:07.561 --> 00:26:08.394
<v Speaker 2>level of fundamental presupposition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But most of the scientists are just </v>

485
00:26:12.091 --> 00:26:14.550
<v Speaker 2>nibbling on the edges between order and </v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos.</v>

486
00:26:14.551 --> 00:26:16.050
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a whole monstrous,</v>

487
00:26:16.051 --> 00:26:19.080
<v Speaker 2>massive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the moving forward tiny amounts at once.</v>

488
00:26:19.081 --> 00:26:21.570
<v Speaker 2>And so that's partly what makes science </v>
<v Speaker 2>extremely powerful.</v>

489
00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:23.303
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

490
00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:27.110
<v Speaker 2>We don't know why people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>industrious,</v>

491
00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:28.843
<v Speaker 2>we can't figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a sneaking suspicion I told you </v>

492
00:26:32.841 --> 00:26:33.674
<v Speaker 2>that maybe part of it is that they want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to win within a defined framework and </v>

493
00:26:38.991 --> 00:26:41.770
<v Speaker 2>then that might be associated with </v>
<v Speaker 2>hyperglycemia.</v>

494
00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:45.450
<v Speaker 2>Now one of the things you see is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a gender difference between men</v>

495
00:26:45.451 --> 00:26:47.430
<v Speaker 2>and women in relationship to </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness,</v>

496
00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:48.533
<v Speaker 2>not conscientiousness overall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but women are more orderly than men and </v>

497
00:26:51.841 --> 00:26:52.674
<v Speaker 2>men are more industrious than women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that kind of goes along with the </v>

498
00:26:54.871 --> 00:26:55.704
<v Speaker 2>hyper gummy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you remember high pergamum he has </v>

499
00:26:57.931 --> 00:27:01.350
<v Speaker 2>this tendency that I described already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the case had many,</v>

500
00:27:01.351 --> 00:27:04.620
<v Speaker 2>many among many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many types of creature.</v>

501
00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:09.030
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there might be that as a motivation,</v>

502
00:27:09.031 --> 00:27:09.864
<v Speaker 2>although I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that you can simply say </v>

503
00:27:12.841 --> 00:27:15.750
<v Speaker 2>that men think that if they get </v>
<v Speaker 2>successful,</v>

504
00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:18.720
<v Speaker 2>they're going to have more luck with </v>
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>

505
00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:22.680
<v Speaker 2>Although that's certainly a conscious </v>
<v Speaker 2>realization on the part of many men.</v>

506
00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:25.570
<v Speaker 2>I think it's such a deep phenomena </v>
<v Speaker 2>though that it's bill,</v>

507
00:27:25.571 --> 00:27:29.430
<v Speaker 2>it's more like it's built into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivational system a priority,</v>

508
00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:33.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so anyways,</v>

509
00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:36.840
<v Speaker 2>so that would go on the masculine </v>
<v Speaker 2>independence front.</v>

510
00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:37.733
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we still haven't been able to </v>

511
00:27:40.291 --> 00:27:42.780
<v Speaker 2>manipulate that with any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to any great degree.</v>

512
00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:48.260
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we're thinking as well that what </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientious people are doing is not so</v>

513
00:27:48.541 --> 00:27:53.541
<v Speaker 2>much striving to get to the talk as they</v>
<v Speaker 2>are trying really hard to stay away from</v>

514
00:27:53.581 --> 00:27:56.940
<v Speaker 2>the bottom and now would go along with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

515
00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:01.800
<v Speaker 2>with the orderliness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>industriousness overlap,</v>

516
00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:03.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say if,</v>

517
00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:04.613
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

518
00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:08.700
<v Speaker 2>part of what makes you orderly and </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhat industrious is disgust,</v>

519
00:28:08.701 --> 00:28:11.340
<v Speaker 2>sensitivity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that you might want to</v>

520
00:28:11.341 --> 00:28:12.174
<v Speaker 2>do is flee from the bottom of dominance </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies because the bottom of the </v>

521
00:28:16.201 --> 00:28:17.034
<v Speaker 2>dominance hierarchy is a bad place to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the perspective of maintenance of </v>

522
00:28:21.061 --> 00:28:21.510
<v Speaker 2>health.</v>

523
00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:22.343
<v Speaker 2>Like people at the bottom of dominance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies are generally speaking in </v>

524
00:28:25.411 --> 00:28:28.410
<v Speaker 2>much rougher shape than the people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>are closer to the talk.</v>

525
00:28:28.411 --> 00:28:32.160
<v Speaker 2>And so part of being industriousness </v>
<v Speaker 2>might want,</v>

526
00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:33.023
<v Speaker 2>might be maybe you're motivated by not </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanting to fail and then you might </v>

527
00:28:37.021 --> 00:28:38.280
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's anxiety,</v>

528
00:28:38.281 --> 00:28:39.960
<v Speaker 2>but maybe not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

529
00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:41.123
<v Speaker 2>conscientious people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say you have someone walking down </v>

530
00:28:43.261 --> 00:28:45.570
<v Speaker 2>the street and they encounter a homeless</v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

531
00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:46.673
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is a conscientious person more or less </v>

532
00:28:48.691 --> 00:28:49.524
<v Speaker 2>likely to give the conscientious person </v>
<v Speaker 2>money or give the homeless person to </v>

533
00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:56.850
<v Speaker 2>give the homeless person money?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think?</v>

534
00:28:58.140 --> 00:28:59.100
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

535
00:28:59.101 --> 00:29:01.680
<v Speaker 2>No agreeable person that they'll give </v>
<v Speaker 2>the person money.</v>

536
00:29:01.681 --> 00:29:03.360
<v Speaker 2>The conscientious first and especially </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

537
00:29:03.361 --> 00:29:06.770
<v Speaker 2>wasn't that sort of hyper orderly or say</v>
<v Speaker 2>get a job.</v>

538
00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:10.770
<v Speaker 2>And they do that because conscientious </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are also more judgmental.</v>

539
00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:13.680
<v Speaker 2>And that goes along with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

540
00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:16.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hierarchical attitude.</v>

541
00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:17.250
<v Speaker 2>I think they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

542
00:29:17.251 --> 00:29:18.084
<v Speaker 2>they genuinely run on the principal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but being higher up in the hierarchy is </v>

543
00:29:21.391 --> 00:29:25.560
<v Speaker 2>better and that there's something wrong </v>
<v Speaker 2>with you from a moral perspective if you</v>

544
00:29:25.561 --> 00:29:26.640
<v Speaker 2>happen to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

545
00:29:26.641 --> 00:29:27.474
<v Speaker 2>among the failures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so one possibility is that part of </v>

546
00:29:30.541 --> 00:29:31.374
<v Speaker 2>the reason that conscientious people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>industrious people are that way is </v>

547
00:29:33.751 --> 00:29:34.584
<v Speaker 2>because they judge themselves quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>harshly and they really do not want to </v>

548
00:29:38.011 --> 00:29:39.660
<v Speaker 2>fail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's not because they're anxious,</v>

549
00:29:39.661 --> 00:29:40.494
<v Speaker 2>it's because they're disgusted self </v>
<v Speaker 2>disgusted by the possibility that they </v>

550
00:29:44.441 --> 00:29:45.274
<v Speaker 2>might count among the failures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that grounded it in an entirely </v>

551
00:29:49.841 --> 00:29:54.841
<v Speaker 2>different motivational system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now there's some other things about</v>

552
00:29:57.580 --> 00:30:00.850
<v Speaker 2>how about conscientiousness that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty interesting.</v>

553
00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:03.940
<v Speaker 2>I think they're kind of revolutionarily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

554
00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:07.150
<v Speaker 2>So the first thing I told you was that </v>
<v Speaker 2>overall,</v>

555
00:30:07.151 --> 00:30:08.450
<v Speaker 2>especially for industries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to us,</v>

556
00:30:08.451 --> 00:30:11.410
<v Speaker 2>we have no theoretical model,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no neuropsychological bottle,</v>

557
00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:14.500
<v Speaker 2>no psychological model and no </v>
<v Speaker 2>pharmacological model.</v>

558
00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:15.513
<v Speaker 2>I could add to that no animal model.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's pretty damn weird because </v>

559
00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:21.033
<v Speaker 2>pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty.</v>

560
00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:21.873
<v Speaker 2>Almost always when you discover </v>
<v Speaker 2>something psychometrically and it's </v>

561
00:30:24.131 --> 00:30:24.964
<v Speaker 2>stable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can start connecting it to other </v>

562
00:30:26.771 --> 00:30:28.180
<v Speaker 2>things that you've discovered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

563
00:30:28.181 --> 00:30:29.014
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>extroversion is associated with </v>

564
00:30:29.981 --> 00:30:30.814
<v Speaker 2>incentive reward and neuroticism is </v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with the anxiety systems and </v>

565
00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:35.673
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stability looks like it's associated </v>

566
00:30:36.941 --> 00:30:40.450
<v Speaker 2>with higher levels of Serotonin and </v>
<v Speaker 2>openness looks like it's associated with</v>

567
00:30:40.451 --> 00:30:45.451
<v Speaker 2>decreased latent inhibition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we know we've got some insight into</v>

568
00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:49.810
<v Speaker 2>what's going on at other levels of </v>
<v Speaker 2>analysis with regards to these traits.</v>

569
00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:53.530
<v Speaker 2>Conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

570
00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:56.710
<v Speaker 2>except for this connection between </v>
<v Speaker 2>orderliness and discussed.</v>

571
00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:58.470
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

572
00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:03.420
<v Speaker 2>well that's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are there conscientious animals?</v>

573
00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:04.740
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a tough one.</v>

574
00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:09.030
<v Speaker 2>You might say yes because sled dogs and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that sort of thing and,</v>

575
00:31:09.031 --> 00:31:12.540
<v Speaker 2>and like Australian blue heelers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

576
00:31:12.541 --> 00:31:13.580
<v Speaker 2>they're super intelligence.</v>

577
00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:15.330
<v Speaker 2>So that is something to take into </v>
<v Speaker 2>account.</v>

578
00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:17.910
<v Speaker 2>But they also really seem to like to </v>
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>

579
00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:21.510
<v Speaker 2>But I would say they're probably more </v>
<v Speaker 2>enthusiastic than conscientious,</v>

580
00:31:21.810 --> 00:31:23.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause they love to work.</v>

581
00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:24.840
<v Speaker 2>They're out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're wagging their tail.</v>

582
00:31:24.841 --> 00:31:27.600
<v Speaker 2>It's like that's not what you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're doing telephone sales.</v>

583
00:31:27.601 --> 00:31:28.860
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

584
00:31:29.570 --> 00:31:34.080
<v Speaker 2>but</v>
<v Speaker 2>like sort of like this idea of some kind</v>

585
00:31:34.081 --> 00:31:37.100
<v Speaker 2>of value,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more gentlemen indicted in Ibm.</v>

586
00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:41.370
<v Speaker 2>So I don't think animals has this kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

587
00:31:41.371 --> 00:31:42.490
<v Speaker 2>whenever more rude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

588
00:31:42.491 --> 00:31:45.250
<v Speaker 2>it's not obvious like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because if you look at chimpanzees,</v>

589
00:31:45.251 --> 00:31:46.850
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

590
00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:48.063
<v Speaker 2>the chimpanzees and other primates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have pretty stable dominance </v>

591
00:31:50.921 --> 00:31:53.970
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies there actually hereditary </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

592
00:31:54.270 --> 00:31:55.103
<v Speaker 2>the top primates are pretty rough on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bottom primates and a lot of it looks </v>

593
00:32:00.341 --> 00:32:02.530
<v Speaker 2>like contempt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

594
00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:04.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because what else would it be?</v>

595
00:32:04.661 --> 00:32:05.800
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>

596
00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:09.190
<v Speaker 2>But by the same token,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that easy to generate an animal</v>

597
00:32:09.191 --> 00:32:10.330
<v Speaker 2>model of disgust.</v>

598
00:32:10.330 --> 00:32:12.130
<v Speaker 2>That's another problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

599
00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:13.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think about dogs,</v>

600
00:32:13.391 --> 00:32:15.670
<v Speaker 2>those bloody things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not disgusted by anything.</v>

601
00:32:16.150 --> 00:32:16.983
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're enthusiastic about lots of </v>

602
00:32:18.071 --> 00:32:20.710
<v Speaker 2>things that no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing in its right mind should ever be</v>

603
00:32:20.711 --> 00:32:24.560
<v Speaker 2>enthusiastic about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>

604
00:32:24.561 --> 00:32:25.270
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

605
00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:30.040
<v Speaker 2>so</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right.</v>

606
00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:32.650
<v Speaker 2>So overall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're conscientious,</v>

607
00:32:32.890 --> 00:32:34.810
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be more satisfied with </v>
<v Speaker 2>your life,</v>

608
00:32:34.811 --> 00:32:37.900
<v Speaker 2>especially as you've progressed through </v>
<v Speaker 2>time and you're going to be more,</v>

609
00:32:38.050 --> 00:32:39.890
<v Speaker 2>more happy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be happier.</v>

610
00:32:40.670 --> 00:32:44.240
<v Speaker 2>Which is funny because of course </v>
<v Speaker 2>happiness is basically extroversion.</v>

611
00:32:44.241 --> 00:32:47.360
<v Speaker 2>So you might ask what does that have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do with conscientiousness?</v>

612
00:32:47.361 --> 00:32:48.194
<v Speaker 2>But what it seems to happen is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of your conscientious across </v>

613
00:32:50.091 --> 00:32:50.924
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your life actually stabilizes and gets </v>

614
00:32:52.641 --> 00:32:56.090
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so even though you might not be more</v>

615
00:32:56.091 --> 00:32:57.680
<v Speaker 2>happy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll be less miserable.</v>

616
00:32:57.681 --> 00:32:58.514
<v Speaker 2>And they'll tell you if you give people </v>
<v Speaker 2>a choice between les miserable and </v>

617
00:33:01.131 --> 00:33:03.890
<v Speaker 2>happier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll take less miserable because it's</v>

618
00:33:03.891 --> 00:33:05.420
<v Speaker 2>really painful to be miserable.</v>

619
00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:09.740
<v Speaker 2>But it's only so it's only moderately </v>
<v Speaker 2>good to be happy.</v>

620
00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:10.873
<v Speaker 2>We have a much bigger capacity for </v>
<v Speaker 2>negative emotion then for positive </v>

621
00:33:13.101 --> 00:33:13.934
<v Speaker 2>emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's positively related to life </v>

622
00:33:17.781 --> 00:33:18.614
<v Speaker 2>satisfaction and happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also positively related to </v>

623
00:33:21.081 --> 00:33:21.914
<v Speaker 2>depression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Conscientious people are more likely to </v>

624
00:33:23.481 --> 00:33:24.314
<v Speaker 2>get depressed now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's part of the reason why there </v>

625
00:33:27.231 --> 00:33:29.330
<v Speaker 2>might be some variation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Conscientiousness.</v>

626
00:33:29.331 --> 00:33:31.820
<v Speaker 2>So you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well conscientious people do really well</v>

627
00:33:31.821 --> 00:33:32.654
<v Speaker 2>when they're fully employed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you fire someone who's </v>

628
00:33:35.211 --> 00:33:36.044
<v Speaker 2>conscientious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do not have a good time with it </v>

629
00:33:38.391 --> 00:33:39.224
<v Speaker 2>because the judgmental part of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>personality starts to wreak havoc with </v>

630
00:33:43.311 --> 00:33:44.260
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

631
00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:46.790
<v Speaker 2>because their attitude is if you work </v>
<v Speaker 2>hard,</v>

632
00:33:46.791 --> 00:33:48.410
<v Speaker 2>you can get ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

633
00:33:48.411 --> 00:33:49.244
<v Speaker 2>And so that's an index.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your success is an index of your moral </v>

634
00:33:51.381 --> 00:33:52.430
<v Speaker 2>value,</v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially.</v>

635
00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.650
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so then you lose your,</v>

636
00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:55.783
<v Speaker 2>your employment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the hell are you supposed to </v>

637
00:33:56.871 --> 00:33:57.704
<v Speaker 2>conclude?</v>

638
00:33:57.980 --> 00:33:58.813
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't conclude that the whole </v>

639
00:34:00.411 --> 00:34:01.244
<v Speaker 2>system is rotten,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're very unlikely to do that if </v>

640
00:34:03.141 --> 00:34:05.750
<v Speaker 2>you're conscientious cause you're sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a patriotic type and,</v>

641
00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:06.560
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

642
00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:07.393
<v Speaker 2>you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you identify quite strongly with the </v>

643
00:34:09.141 --> 00:34:11.420
<v Speaker 2>structure of the system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And plus,</v>

644
00:34:11.870 --> 00:34:12.703
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientious people are very concerned </v>

645
00:34:14.571 --> 00:34:16.400
<v Speaker 2>with justice and they might think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

646
00:34:16.401 --> 00:34:19.340
<v Speaker 2>if I'm going to have this attitude </v>
<v Speaker 2>towards other people who failed,</v>

647
00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:20.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are unemployed,</v>

648
00:34:20.571 --> 00:34:23.150
<v Speaker 2>let's say I have to have the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>attitude towards me.</v>

649
00:34:23.151 --> 00:34:25.160
<v Speaker 2>And so what you see with conscientious </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

650
00:34:25.490 --> 00:34:27.100
<v Speaker 2>if they're having,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

651
00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:27.943
<v Speaker 2>maybe they've got laid off at work </v>
<v Speaker 2>really through absolutely no fault of </v>

652
00:34:31.071 --> 00:34:31.904
<v Speaker 2>their own,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are just torn up by it because one </v>

653
00:34:35.901 --> 00:34:36.734
<v Speaker 2>of the things they do that's different </v>
<v Speaker 2>for an unconscientious first and </v>

654
00:34:38.721 --> 00:34:40.460
<v Speaker 2>everything is always someone else's </v>
<v Speaker 2>fault.</v>

655
00:34:41.090 --> 00:34:43.200
<v Speaker 2>But for a conscientious person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the opposite.</v>

656
00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:45.050
<v Speaker 2>And everything is always their fault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

657
00:34:45.051 --> 00:34:47.690
<v Speaker 2>the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an advantage to that a cause.</v>

658
00:34:47.691 --> 00:34:50.360
<v Speaker 2>If you take responsibility for your </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation,</v>

659
00:34:50.361 --> 00:34:55.361
<v Speaker 2>then there's a possibility that you'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>make whatever changes you can to improve</v>

660
00:34:55.431 --> 00:34:56.680
<v Speaker 2>your situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

661
00:34:56.700 --> 00:35:01.700
<v Speaker 2>So even if you're only 10% at fault,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you take responsibility for that,</v>

662
00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:06.260
<v Speaker 2>then you can fix that 10% and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>things will work out better for you.</v>

663
00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:07.483
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some advantages to </v>

664
00:35:08.331 --> 00:35:11.240
<v Speaker 2>overestimating the degree to which </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're at fault.</v>

665
00:35:11.241 --> 00:35:11.991
<v Speaker 2>And if you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

666
00:35:11.991 --> 00:35:13.460
<v Speaker 2>it's the system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

667
00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:14.670
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>

668
00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:15.890
<v Speaker 2>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go fix that.</v>

669
00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:16.753
<v Speaker 2>Like it's not going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not a very effective means of </v>

670
00:35:19.131 --> 00:35:22.670
<v Speaker 2>coping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in psychotic depression,</v>

671
00:35:22.671 --> 00:35:24.200
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a very,</v>

672
00:35:24.201 --> 00:35:27.950
<v Speaker 2>very extreme form of depression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you often see is that the depressed</v>

673
00:35:27.951 --> 00:35:28.784
<v Speaker 2>person erroneously concludes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a metaphysical conclusion </v>

674
00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:36.920
<v Speaker 2>almost that their faults are integrally </v>
<v Speaker 2>tied to the,</v>

675
00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:39.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to everything that happens that's bad in</v>

676
00:35:39.721 --> 00:35:40.554
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

677
00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:45.330
<v Speaker 2>And so they take on all of the guilt for</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that's gone wrong.</v>

678
00:35:45.331 --> 00:35:46.164
<v Speaker 2>And obviously that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a point at which that's a </v>

679
00:35:47.941 --> 00:35:50.640
<v Speaker 2>relatively counterproductive conclusion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

680
00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:55.140
<v Speaker 2>especially because often when bad things</v>
<v Speaker 2>happen to you in life,</v>

681
00:35:56.370 --> 00:36:01.350
<v Speaker 2>there's a random element and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't really treat yourself properly</v>

682
00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:04.290
<v Speaker 2>unless you take that random element into</v>
<v Speaker 2>account.</v>

683
00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:06.750
<v Speaker 2>Now you can overestimate it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what you do.</v>

684
00:36:06.751 --> 00:36:09.240
<v Speaker 2>If you're under,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm unconscientious and you could,</v>

685
00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:13.080
<v Speaker 2>could overestimate it if you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>unconscientious and underestimated,</v>

686
00:36:13.090 --> 00:36:16.320
<v Speaker 2>if you're conscientious and there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be times when you paid for both</v>

687
00:36:16.321 --> 00:36:18.300
<v Speaker 2>of those attitudes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

688
00:36:18.301 --> 00:36:20.610
<v Speaker 2>conscientious people don't do very well </v>
<v Speaker 2>when they're,</v>

689
00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:23.310
<v Speaker 2>when they're not doing very well because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

690
00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:25.590
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they judge themselves very harshly.</v>

691
00:36:26.330 --> 00:36:30.450
<v Speaker 2>And so that's partly what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's related to guilt.</v>

692
00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:31.973
<v Speaker 2>It's not a hat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a funny thing because there's an </v>

693
00:36:34.141 --> 00:36:37.140
<v Speaker 2>element of guilt that's associated with </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness too.</v>

694
00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:41.190
<v Speaker 2>So conscientious people feel guilt less </v>
<v Speaker 2>often,</v>

695
00:36:41.730 --> 00:36:43.200
<v Speaker 2>but they're more sensitive to it.</v>

696
00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:45.880
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you think,</v>

697
00:36:45.881 --> 00:36:48.550
<v Speaker 2>well that's kind of paradoxical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not exactly paradoxical.</v>

698
00:36:48.551 --> 00:36:49.384
<v Speaker 2>If you're sensitive to guilt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might arrange things so that you </v>

699
00:36:51.071 --> 00:36:51.904
<v Speaker 2>have nothing to feel guilty about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what conscientious people </v>

700
00:36:54.611 --> 00:36:57.490
<v Speaker 2>seem to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so guilt,</v>

701
00:36:59.020 --> 00:36:59.853
<v Speaker 2>guilt and shame seemed to be emotions </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are integrity associated with </v>

702
00:37:02.621 --> 00:37:06.670
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness and they're kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult to disentangle it,</v>

703
00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:07.623
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And maybe they're not even really </v>

704
00:37:08.471 --> 00:37:11.830
<v Speaker 2>separate things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But shame seems to be something that you</v>

705
00:37:11.831 --> 00:37:14.860
<v Speaker 2>feel when you fail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps in the eyes of others.</v>

706
00:37:14.861 --> 00:37:15.694
<v Speaker 2>And guilt is something that you feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you fail according to your own </v>

707
00:37:18.761 --> 00:37:19.594
<v Speaker 2>standards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I know that that's kind of a messy </v>

708
00:37:21.011 --> 00:37:21.844
<v Speaker 2>definition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but conscientious people do seem to be </v>

709
00:37:24.461 --> 00:37:25.294
<v Speaker 2>more prone to shame and guilt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And those seem to be in principle </v>

710
00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:30.333
<v Speaker 2>mediated by different systems than the </v>
<v Speaker 2>systems that mediate anxiety and </v>

711
00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:37.090
<v Speaker 2>emotional pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we don't know what the systems are.</v>

712
00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:42.600
<v Speaker 2>Now you can also think about it</v>
<v Speaker 2>in relationship to something,</v>

713
00:37:42.741 --> 00:37:44.600
<v Speaker 2>you know what to what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>existentialists called,</v>

714
00:37:44.601 --> 00:37:47.360
<v Speaker 2>like the existential burden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

715
00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:51.590
<v Speaker 2>people are always doing things in </v>
<v Speaker 2>groups.</v>

716
00:37:55.350 --> 00:37:59.550
<v Speaker 2>The groups are often oriented to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to produce a certain outcome,</v>

717
00:37:59.551 --> 00:38:00.384
<v Speaker 2>like a hunting party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could say that if we're thinking of </v>

718
00:38:01.741 --> 00:38:03.940
<v Speaker 2>it from an evolutionary perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's it,</v>

719
00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:05.373
<v Speaker 2>there's a goal and it's an important </v>
<v Speaker 2>goal and they're going to be good </v>

720
00:38:09.151 --> 00:38:10.740
<v Speaker 2>hunters and hundreds of that aren't so </v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

721
00:38:11.310 --> 00:38:12.143
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

722
00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:14.513
<v Speaker 2>part of the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is to think of a hierarchy as </v>

723
00:38:17.131 --> 00:38:17.964
<v Speaker 2>something other than a dominance </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy because the dominance </v>

724
00:38:20.011 --> 00:38:23.190
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy theory is slightly flawed </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it implies that the hierarchy is</v>

725
00:38:23.191 --> 00:38:25.020
<v Speaker 2>only based on power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

726
00:38:25.021 --> 00:38:25.854
<v Speaker 2>But that's not right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you have a hunting party or a </v>

727
00:38:28.471 --> 00:38:33.420
<v Speaker 2>building crew or anything like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of what elevates one man above the</v>

728
00:38:33.421 --> 00:38:35.440
<v Speaker 2>other in the dominance hierarchy isn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>

729
00:38:35.441 --> 00:38:37.150
<v Speaker 2>It's competence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

730
00:38:37.151 --> 00:38:37.984
<v Speaker 2>So the best hunter has the highest </v>
<v Speaker 2>reputation or the best builder has the </v>

731
00:38:40.781 --> 00:38:41.614
<v Speaker 2>highest reputation or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it depends on what the hierarchy is </v>

732
00:38:43.901 --> 00:38:44.734
<v Speaker 2>devoted for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the person who's best at that rises </v>

733
00:38:46.391 --> 00:38:47.410
<v Speaker 2>to the top,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

734
00:38:47.411 --> 00:38:50.110
<v Speaker 2>all other things being equal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's often the case.</v>

735
00:38:50.111 --> 00:38:51.970
<v Speaker 2>Even if people don't like them very </v>
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>

736
00:38:52.330 --> 00:38:54.580
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've done investigations into corporate</v>

737
00:38:54.581 --> 00:38:55.414
<v Speaker 2>structures where someone will be </v>
<v Speaker 2>approved by a relatively large majority </v>

738
00:38:59.921 --> 00:39:03.160
<v Speaker 2>of the people who worked for the company</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're hyper competent,</v>

739
00:39:03.161 --> 00:39:05.290
<v Speaker 2>but no one really likes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

740
00:39:05.290 --> 00:39:08.320
<v Speaker 2>And so you can't really think of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>

741
00:39:08.350 --> 00:39:11.170
<v Speaker 2>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>either a popularity contest or something</v>

742
00:39:11.171 --> 00:39:12.004
<v Speaker 2>that's based on power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that a decent hierarchies </v>

743
00:39:15.011 --> 00:39:17.800
<v Speaker 2>almost never based on power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>based on competence.</v>

744
00:39:17.830 --> 00:39:21.820
<v Speaker 2>Now those two things get tangled up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but well,</v>

745
00:39:21.821 --> 00:39:25.720
<v Speaker 2>so then you think one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's going to make people</v>

746
00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:28.323
<v Speaker 2>prone to being successful is to feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>some responsibility in relationship to </v>

747
00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:38.740
<v Speaker 2>their capacity to attain a goal in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>group situation.</v>

748
00:39:38.770 --> 00:39:39.603
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's partly the origin of </v>
<v Speaker 2>both conscientiousness and guilt and </v>

749
00:39:43.001 --> 00:39:44.290
<v Speaker 2>shame.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

750
00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:45.333
<v Speaker 2>lots of times if you talk to unemployed </v>
<v Speaker 2>people and you know we hear a lot about </v>

751
00:39:50.231 --> 00:39:52.110
<v Speaker 2>rates of depression and that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

752
00:39:52.111 --> 00:39:54.610
<v Speaker 2>but what kind of boneheaded about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way we measure things?</v>

753
00:39:54.611 --> 00:39:58.090
<v Speaker 2>Like if you want to be depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best thing to do is lose your job.</v>

754
00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:02.380
<v Speaker 2>And then you really got to ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you depressed or are you unemployed?</v>

755
00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:04.240
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those aren't the same thing.</v>

756
00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:05.620
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you might say,</v>

757
00:40:05.621 --> 00:40:08.590
<v Speaker 2>well for some people unemployment </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't make them depressed.</v>

758
00:40:08.591 --> 00:40:09.101
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

759
00:40:09.101 --> 00:40:09.934
<v Speaker 2>we know that that's the unconscientious </v>
<v Speaker 2>people or maybe the unconscientious </v>

760
00:40:12.311 --> 00:40:14.080
<v Speaker 2>people and the emotionally stable </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

761
00:40:14.081 --> 00:40:17.620
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for the people who are conscientious</v>

762
00:40:17.621 --> 00:40:20.740
<v Speaker 2>and also maybe somewhat neurotic man </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just going to wipe them out.</v>

763
00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:23.890
<v Speaker 2>But to think about that as psychological</v>
<v Speaker 2>is rather foolish.</v>

764
00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:25.233
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

765
00:40:25.690 --> 00:40:29.530
<v Speaker 2>it's an actual loss and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>responding to it in an actual way.</v>

766
00:40:30.010 --> 00:40:32.740
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

767
00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:33.783
<v Speaker 2>and usually people who are unemployed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean part of the reason that they get </v>

768
00:40:36.251 --> 00:40:38.530
<v Speaker 2>depressed is because they're worried </v>
<v Speaker 2>about their future,</v>

769
00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:40.930
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's not the only reason.</v>

770
00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:44.410
<v Speaker 2>What they often talk about is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've let people down.</v>

771
00:40:44.650 --> 00:40:45.483
<v Speaker 2>So that'd be people in their family or </v>
<v Speaker 2>they let themselves down or they're </v>

772
00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:48.633
<v Speaker 2>performing underneath their capacity or </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just useless and aren't </v>

773
00:40:51.491 --> 00:40:52.324
<v Speaker 2>contributing.</v>

774
00:40:52.450 --> 00:40:54.570
<v Speaker 2>And those are all places where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

775
00:40:54.590 --> 00:40:55.423
<v Speaker 2>their guilt will start to eat them up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And those are the sorts of things that </v>

776
00:40:57.911 --> 00:41:00.430
<v Speaker 2>seem also to be associated with </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness.</v>

777
00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:01.563
<v Speaker 2>It's like the idea that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're part of a team of sled dogs in </v>

778
00:41:05.471 --> 00:41:06.304
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a responsibility to pull your </v>

779
00:41:08.381 --> 00:41:10.030
<v Speaker 2>weight and if you're not pulling your </v>
<v Speaker 2>weight,</v>

780
00:41:10.031 --> 00:41:11.920
<v Speaker 2>then there's something contemptible </v>
<v Speaker 2>about you.</v>

781
00:41:11.921 --> 00:41:15.010
<v Speaker 2>And if you happen to be one of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who aren't pulling their weight,</v>

782
00:41:15.011 --> 00:41:16.750
<v Speaker 2>then there's something contemptible </v>
<v Speaker 2>about you,</v>

783
00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:17.673
<v Speaker 2>even if it's you making the judgment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So and conscientious people are </v>

784
00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:23.140
<v Speaker 2>definitely more judgmental.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

785
00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:24.363
<v Speaker 2>if you read them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you tell them stories about people </v>

786
00:41:27.551 --> 00:41:28.384
<v Speaker 2>who performed various criminal and cause</v>
<v Speaker 2>I criminal acts and you get them to </v>

787
00:41:31.871 --> 00:41:36.530
<v Speaker 2>estimate the sentence that they should </v>
<v Speaker 2>be subjected to the conscientious people</v>

788
00:41:36.531 --> 00:41:38.930
<v Speaker 2>will reliably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

789
00:41:38.931 --> 00:41:41.420
<v Speaker 2>put people in prison for longer periods </v>
<v Speaker 2>of time.</v>

790
00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:42.313
<v Speaker 2>They don't like violations of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't like violations of norms or </v>

791
00:41:45.021 --> 00:41:48.680
<v Speaker 2>violations of rules and so and so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

792
00:41:48.681 --> 00:41:49.514
<v Speaker 2>so one of the reasons that people might </v>
<v Speaker 2>bet there might be a distribution and </v>

793
00:41:52.341 --> 00:41:55.670
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness is like maybe when the</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole economy collapses,</v>

794
00:41:55.671 --> 00:41:56.504
<v Speaker 2>which happens fairly frequently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the conscientious people just wipe </v>

795
00:41:59.331 --> 00:42:00.530
<v Speaker 2>themselves out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

796
00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:01.393
<v Speaker 2>they're so depressed and so self </v>
<v Speaker 2>judgemental and so crushed that they </v>

797
00:42:05.481 --> 00:42:07.730
<v Speaker 2>can't handle the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you know,</v>

798
00:42:07.731 --> 00:42:08.900
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you call that?</v>

799
00:42:08.901 --> 00:42:10.500
<v Speaker 2>That's the very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

800
00:42:10.501 --> 00:42:13.580
<v Speaker 2>it's variability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not the word I was looking for.</v>

801
00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:16.130
<v Speaker 2>So they get clipped off when things </v>
<v Speaker 2>fail.</v>

802
00:42:16.170 --> 00:42:18.200
<v Speaker 2>Co I'm conscientious person doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>really care.</v>

803
00:42:18.201 --> 00:42:19.034
<v Speaker 2>And that's actually sort of almost like </v>
<v Speaker 2>the defining characteristic of an </v>

804
00:42:22.161 --> 00:42:24.380
<v Speaker 2>unconscientious person is they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>really care.</v>

805
00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:28.850
<v Speaker 2>And that's an interesting thing too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's often more fun to be around</v>

806
00:42:28.851 --> 00:42:29.684
<v Speaker 2>unconscientious people than it is to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're unconscientious people because </v>

807
00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:36.380
<v Speaker 2>it's very hard to relax around people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who are really orderly and judgmental.</v>

808
00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:39.440
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't even sit improperly or you get</v>

809
00:42:39.441 --> 00:42:41.990
<v Speaker 2>judged for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if you're in someone's house and</v>

810
00:42:41.991 --> 00:42:43.970
<v Speaker 2>they're unconscientious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

811
00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:45.980
<v Speaker 2>and you throw your beer can on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>floor,</v>

812
00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:48.050
<v Speaker 2>they'll just laugh and throw their beer </v>
<v Speaker 2>camera,</v>

813
00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:50.030
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's,</v>

814
00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:54.680
<v Speaker 2>I think it's difficult to relax with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with really hyper conscientious people.</v>

815
00:42:54.890 --> 00:42:56.570
<v Speaker 2>It's probably difficult to have fun with</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

816
00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:59.180
<v Speaker 2>I think it's difficult for them to </v>
<v Speaker 2>relax.</v>

817
00:42:59.390 --> 00:43:00.190
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

818
00:43:00.190 --> 00:43:03.530
<v Speaker 2>they tend like conservative people tend </v>
<v Speaker 2>to read less,</v>

819
00:43:04.010 --> 00:43:04.850
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you might think,</v>

820
00:43:04.851 --> 00:43:05.684
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that might be associated with their </v>

821
00:43:07.041 --> 00:43:10.430
<v Speaker 2>interest in intellectual activity </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're also lower and openness.</v>

822
00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:14.480
<v Speaker 2>But I think it's also because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>regard reading as a waste of time,</v>

823
00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:18.230
<v Speaker 2>not because they exactly regard reading </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a waste of time,</v>

824
00:43:18.231 --> 00:43:21.890
<v Speaker 2>but they feel guilty if they're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>working and instead they're sitting down</v>

825
00:43:21.891 --> 00:43:22.724
<v Speaker 2>reading of us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing sitting down reading </v>

826
00:43:23.931 --> 00:43:24.531
<v Speaker 2>a book?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

827
00:43:24.531 --> 00:43:29.120
<v Speaker 2>there's work to be done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they're very work oriented.</v>

828
00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:33.650
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

829
00:43:36.190 --> 00:43:38.350
<v Speaker 2>orderliness is a good predictor of </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservatism,</v>

830
00:43:38.351 --> 00:43:41.140
<v Speaker 2>as we've already said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's associated with disgust,</v>

831
00:43:41.141 --> 00:43:44.230
<v Speaker 2>sensitivity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and preference for order and tradition,</v>

832
00:43:44.410 --> 00:43:47.320
<v Speaker 2>not egalitarianism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then you think,</v>

833
00:43:47.321 --> 00:43:50.020
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where's the egalitarian motivations?</v>

834
00:43:50.021 --> 00:43:52.740
<v Speaker 2>And they all seem to pile up pretty much</v>
<v Speaker 2>on agreeableness.</v>

835
00:43:53.470 --> 00:43:55.570
<v Speaker 2>So the conscientious people basically </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

836
00:43:55.571 --> 00:43:59.320
<v Speaker 2>you can get ahead if you play the game </v>
<v Speaker 2>properly and you abide by the rules that</v>

837
00:43:59.321 --> 00:44:02.050
<v Speaker 2>and you work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the agreeable people say,</v>

838
00:44:02.051 --> 00:44:02.531
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

839
00:44:02.531 --> 00:44:04.780
<v Speaker 2>but there's lots of people who can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>really manage that.</v>

840
00:44:04.781 --> 00:44:05.614
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not just going to push them off a </v>

841
00:44:06.521 --> 00:44:08.080
<v Speaker 2>cliff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They need to be taken care of.</v>

842
00:44:08.081 --> 00:44:11.200
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the situation wasn't fair to begin with.</v>

843
00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:12.513
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

844
00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:14.930
<v Speaker 2>and there's a battle between that all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>

845
00:44:14.931 --> 00:44:15.764
<v Speaker 2>And there's a battle because </v>
<v Speaker 2>agreeableness and conscientiousness are </v>

846
00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:20.193
<v Speaker 2>orthogonal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means that they actually traverse </v>

847
00:44:22.451 --> 00:44:24.250
<v Speaker 2>different ethics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

848
00:44:24.670 --> 00:44:26.800
<v Speaker 2>And they're not opposites on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>continuum,</v>

849
00:44:26.830 --> 00:44:28.450
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness and agreeableness.</v>

850
00:44:28.450 --> 00:44:30.280
<v Speaker 2>That's not it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

851
00:44:30.281 --> 00:44:32.330
<v Speaker 2>and it looks like in order for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

852
00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:35.670
<v Speaker 2>in order for people to adjust to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world of human beings,</v>

853
00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:40.320
<v Speaker 2>you have to be agreeable to some measure</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you have to be conscientious to some</v>

854
00:44:40.321 --> 00:44:42.570
<v Speaker 2>measure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the question is how much of each,</v>

855
00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:45.330
<v Speaker 2>and the answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it depends on the circumstances and</v>

856
00:44:45.331 --> 00:44:48.390
<v Speaker 2>where you place yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But at the same question applies to the,</v>

857
00:44:48.650 --> 00:44:49.483
<v Speaker 2>to the polity at large,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how agreeable should it be versus how </v>

858
00:44:53.041 --> 00:44:55.260
<v Speaker 2>conscientious should it be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a very,</v>

859
00:44:55.261 --> 00:44:56.011
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

860
00:44:56.011 --> 00:44:56.844
<v Speaker 2>it's not a problem with a solution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The solution is only to be derived from </v>

861
00:45:01.021 --> 00:45:01.854
<v Speaker 2>a continual dialogue say between the </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientious people and the agreeable </v>

862
00:45:04.711 --> 00:45:05.544
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the answer varies as the </v>

863
00:45:08.101 --> 00:45:08.934
<v Speaker 2>environment varies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can't come up with an end </v>

864
00:45:11.911 --> 00:45:14.610
<v Speaker 2>solution to that problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

865
00:45:16.670 --> 00:45:17.060
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

866
00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:18.950
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the conscientious people,</v>

867
00:45:18.951 --> 00:45:20.540
<v Speaker 2>so we'll say the conservatives for </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

868
00:45:20.690 --> 00:45:24.230
<v Speaker 2>for the sake of argument,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they liked hierarchies.</v>

869
00:45:24.231 --> 00:45:25.064
<v Speaker 2>They like order,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they like a game that everyone can play </v>

870
00:45:27.731 --> 00:45:32.731
<v Speaker 2>and some people can win and they make </v>
<v Speaker 2>the assumption that if you play properly</v>

871
00:45:33.291 --> 00:45:35.240
<v Speaker 2>and you win,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>

872
00:45:35.330 --> 00:45:38.870
<v Speaker 2>that you've done something good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

873
00:45:38.871 --> 00:45:41.900
<v Speaker 2>the problem is is that if you steepen up</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hierarchy enough,</v>

874
00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:43.633
<v Speaker 2>no one gets to climb it and then the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole bloody society starts to crumble </v>

875
00:45:46.461 --> 00:45:48.720
<v Speaker 2>and breakdown because the rates of </v>
<v Speaker 2>violence go way up.</v>

876
00:45:48.721 --> 00:45:49.554
<v Speaker 2>So you can see there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an upper bound to the steepness </v>

877
00:45:52.431 --> 00:45:53.960
<v Speaker 2>of a hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you might say,</v>

878
00:45:53.961 --> 00:45:54.794
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where conscientiousness hits </v>

879
00:45:56.480 --> 00:46:00.220
<v Speaker 2>limit hits its limit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or You could even say that's where merit</v>

880
00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:02.720
<v Speaker 2>meritocracy hypothetically hits its </v>
<v Speaker 2>limit.</v>

881
00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:05.330
<v Speaker 2>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're intelligent and conscientious,</v>

882
00:46:05.331 --> 00:46:07.880
<v Speaker 2>you're much more likely to rise to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>top of a hierarchy.</v>

883
00:46:08.330 --> 00:46:09.530
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>

884
00:46:09.830 --> 00:46:10.663
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you want smart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hardworking people at the top of </v>

885
00:46:12.561 --> 00:46:13.910
<v Speaker 2>structures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if,</v>

886
00:46:13.930 --> 00:46:16.820
<v Speaker 2>if it's steep like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well then,</v>

887
00:46:18.890 --> 00:46:19.380
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

888
00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:21.180
<v Speaker 2>there's a point at which that isn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>sustainable.</v>

889
00:46:21.690 --> 00:46:23.880
<v Speaker 2>And so the hierarchy has to be flat and </v>
<v Speaker 2>somehow,</v>

890
00:46:24.540 --> 00:46:25.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one.</v>

891
00:46:25.230 --> 00:46:27.570
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's also something that agreeable</v>

892
00:46:27.571 --> 00:46:29.070
<v Speaker 2>people would say right off the bat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

893
00:46:29.071 --> 00:46:32.310
<v Speaker 2>what about the strata at the bottom or </v>
<v Speaker 2>just above the bottom?</v>

894
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:33.833
<v Speaker 2>How are you going to ensure that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't fall right out of the game </v>

895
00:46:36.310 --> 00:46:38.520
<v Speaker 2>altogether,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a perfectly reasonable,</v>

896
00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:41.760
<v Speaker 2>a reasonable question and answer to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

897
00:46:41.761 --> 00:46:44.040
<v Speaker 2>both those questions as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't know how to do that.</v>

898
00:46:44.041 --> 00:46:47.250
<v Speaker 2>And so we're trying to solve that </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem continually as we go along.</v>

899
00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:52.590
<v Speaker 2>So orderly people also have harsh </v>
<v Speaker 2>judgments and moral transgressions.</v>

900
00:46:52.591 --> 00:46:53.424
<v Speaker 2>We talked about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now there's an idea of a behavioral </v>

901
00:46:54.961 --> 00:46:57.360
<v Speaker 2>immune system here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now this is a cool,</v>

902
00:46:57.900 --> 00:46:58.733
<v Speaker 2>cool</v>

903
00:46:59.450 --> 00:47:00.283
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>

904
00:47:08.910 --> 00:47:09.743
<v Speaker 2>So disgust is considered to be one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the basic human emotions defined by a </v>

905
00:47:13.051 --> 00:47:17.460
<v Speaker 2>strong repulsion and desire to withdraw </v>
<v Speaker 2>from and the listening stimulus or event</v>

906
00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:19.313
<v Speaker 2>physically disgust as a company by a </v>
<v Speaker 2>distinct facial expression involving </v>

907
00:47:22.171 --> 00:47:24.270
<v Speaker 2>constriction of the oral and nasal </v>
<v Speaker 2>cavities.</v>

908
00:47:24.271 --> 00:47:27.630
<v Speaker 2>So it's something like that to close </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself off.</v>

909
00:47:28.410 --> 00:47:32.590
<v Speaker 2>Evolutionary of people make that face </v>
<v Speaker 2>when they hear a dirty joke that they're</v>

910
00:47:32.591 --> 00:47:36.430
<v Speaker 2>really quite offended by evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 2>models of disgust.</v>

911
00:47:36.431 --> 00:47:38.560
<v Speaker 2>Propose that it's emotion helped to </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolve,</v>

912
00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:43.150
<v Speaker 2>evolve to help us avoid contaminated or </v>
<v Speaker 2>harmful foods or other potential sources</v>

913
00:47:43.151 --> 00:47:47.140
<v Speaker 2>of disease such as sexual contact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that's interesting.</v>

914
00:47:47.141 --> 00:47:49.750
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's also an idea that floats</v>

915
00:47:49.751 --> 00:47:50.584
<v Speaker 2>around the general culture and I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's be more elaborated upon partly </v>

916
00:47:53.981 --> 00:47:54.814
<v Speaker 2>since the time of Freud by particularly </v>
<v Speaker 2>since the 60s that sexual disgust is </v>

917
00:47:58.451 --> 00:48:01.570
<v Speaker 2>culturally produced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you can just drop that idea.</v>

918
00:48:01.870 --> 00:48:02.703
<v Speaker 2>It's not the case at all any more than </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussed related to food is culturally </v>

919
00:48:05.651 --> 00:48:07.780
<v Speaker 2>produced,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cultural moves it.</v>

920
00:48:08.050 --> 00:48:12.340
<v Speaker 2>But the disgust response to sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>contact and to food is extremely,</v>

921
00:48:12.810 --> 00:48:15.160
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful innately.</v>

922
00:48:15.161 --> 00:48:15.994
<v Speaker 2>And you know that because otherwise </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone would always be sleeping with </v>

923
00:48:18.521 --> 00:48:20.230
<v Speaker 2>everyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there has to,</v>

924
00:48:20.231 --> 00:48:24.160
<v Speaker 2>because obviously sexual contact is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>primary motivator.</v>

925
00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:25.233
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something has to regulate it and you </v>

926
00:48:26.351 --> 00:48:28.570
<v Speaker 2>might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well good sense is what should regulate.</v>

927
00:48:28.571 --> 00:48:29.051
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

928
00:48:29.051 --> 00:48:30.070
<v Speaker 2>right man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good sense,</v>

929
00:48:30.071 --> 00:48:32.890
<v Speaker 2>doesn't regulate good sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't regulate anything.</v>

930
00:48:33.430 --> 00:48:34.263
<v Speaker 2>And so there's no way that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen is the regulator for sexual </v>

931
00:48:37.541 --> 00:48:38.374
<v Speaker 2>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's grounded in contempt and </v>

932
00:48:39.581 --> 00:48:40.261
<v Speaker 2>disgust,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

933
00:48:40.261 --> 00:48:41.094
<v Speaker 2>And we saw a lot of that in the parts of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the crumb video that we watched because </v>

934
00:48:44.471 --> 00:48:48.970
<v Speaker 2>the crumb brothers were always being the</v>
<v Speaker 2>targets of contempt and disgust.</v>

935
00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:50.560
<v Speaker 2>So that's pretty rough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

936
00:48:50.561 --> 00:48:52.420
<v Speaker 2>you got to think about why that is too.</v>

937
00:48:52.420 --> 00:48:55.480
<v Speaker 2>It's sexually transmitted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Diseases are no joke.</v>

938
00:48:55.990 --> 00:48:56.823
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we don't know how long human beings </v>

939
00:48:57.821 --> 00:48:58.654
<v Speaker 2>have been plagued by them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you can presume that it's pretty </v>

940
00:49:00.071 --> 00:49:02.440
<v Speaker 2>much since the beginning of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

941
00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:07.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean syphilis was important from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>new world to the old world and was very,</v>

942
00:49:09.311 --> 00:49:10.144
<v Speaker 2>very hard on Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was one of the reasons that the </v>

943
00:49:11.471 --> 00:49:14.110
<v Speaker 2>victorians were so strict in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexual behavior.</v>

944
00:49:14.111 --> 00:49:14.944
<v Speaker 2>The syphilis was a nasty disease until </v>
<v Speaker 2>we've more or less finally brought it </v>

945
00:49:18.191 --> 00:49:21.250
<v Speaker 2>under control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's quite susceptible to antibiotics.</v>

946
00:49:21.550 --> 00:49:22.271
<v Speaker 2>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

947
00:49:22.271 --> 00:49:25.330
<v Speaker 2>transmissible to infants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is also a major catastrophe.</v>

948
00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:28.000
<v Speaker 2>And then of course aids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was,</v>

949
00:49:28.030 --> 00:49:28.863
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the primary vector for the spread of </v>

950
00:49:30.011 --> 00:49:33.810
<v Speaker 2>aids was promiscuity and the virus </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolved.</v>

951
00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:37.510
<v Speaker 2>Capitalize on promiscuity cause it does </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and you know,</v>

952
00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:41.500
<v Speaker 2>that could easily wiped us out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wiped out tens of millions of people.</v>

953
00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:43.030
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

954
00:49:43.031 --> 00:49:45.520
<v Speaker 2>we're pretty smart and got it under </v>
<v Speaker 2>control pretty fast.</v>

955
00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:46.353
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in some ways it could have easily been </v>

956
00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:49.653
<v Speaker 2>otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also AIDS turned out to be not that </v>

957
00:49:51.521 --> 00:49:53.140
<v Speaker 2>easy to catch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

958
00:49:53.141 --> 00:49:53.974
<v Speaker 2>you actually had to engage in sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>contact and generally you had to engage </v>

959
00:49:57.850 --> 00:50:02.850
<v Speaker 2>in sexual contact of a relatively </v>
<v Speaker 2>nonstandard type because the,</v>

960
00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:08.200
<v Speaker 2>the most typically used tissues are more</v>
<v Speaker 2>robust to the probability of infection.</v>

961
00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:12.690
<v Speaker 2>So we have any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any number of,</v>

962
00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:15.610
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's any number of reasons for people</v>

963
00:50:15.611 --> 00:50:18.700
<v Speaker 2>to be disgusted by sexual contact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

964
00:50:19.620 --> 00:50:20.453
<v Speaker 2>and that's something that has to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>contended with in addition to its role </v>

965
00:50:22.811 --> 00:50:25.600
<v Speaker 2>in directly helping to expel harmful </v>
<v Speaker 2>foods from the body.</v>

966
00:50:25.750 --> 00:50:29.180
<v Speaker 2>Discussed also forms an component of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>behavioral immune system,</v>

967
00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:30.463
<v Speaker 2>the suite of psychological mechanisms </v>
<v Speaker 2>that aid in the detection and avoidance </v>

968
00:50:33.891 --> 00:50:37.580
<v Speaker 2>of potential contaminants before they </v>
<v Speaker 2>can make contact with the body.</v>

969
00:50:38.570 --> 00:50:39.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

970
00:50:39.190 --> 00:50:42.070
<v Speaker 2>so there's the immune system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

971
00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:46.870
<v Speaker 2>It attacks invading pathogens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's an analog in your behavior,</v>

972
00:50:46.871 --> 00:50:49.330
<v Speaker 2>which is that you're unlikely to </v>
<v Speaker 2>approach,</v>

973
00:50:49.660 --> 00:50:53.710
<v Speaker 2>touch and consume anything that happens </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be disgusting.</v>

974
00:50:53.711 --> 00:50:55.990
<v Speaker 2>And it's a weird system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

975
00:50:56.530 --> 00:50:57.363
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are unlikely to want to touch a </v>

976
00:51:00.311 --> 00:51:01.144
<v Speaker 2>sterilized cockroach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't mean one that's unable to </v>

977
00:51:03.311 --> 00:51:04.001
<v Speaker 2>breathe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

978
00:51:04.001 --> 00:51:04.834
<v Speaker 2>I mean one that that's being treated but</v>
<v Speaker 2>heated so that it's free of </v>

979
00:51:08.021 --> 00:51:09.640
<v Speaker 2>contaminants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People don't like to do that.</v>

980
00:51:09.641 --> 00:51:12.040
<v Speaker 2>They won't eat and this will hardly come</v>
<v Speaker 2>as any surprise.</v>

981
00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:16.150
<v Speaker 2>High quality chocolate molded to </v>
<v Speaker 2>resemble dog feces.</v>

982
00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:19.930
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so and everyone laughs about that.</v>

983
00:51:19.931 --> 00:51:20.764
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is kind of an interesting </v>

984
00:51:21.311 --> 00:51:22.144
<v Speaker 2>response.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like of course no one would do that </v>

985
00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:24.100
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

986
00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:24.933
<v Speaker 2>exactly know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although you cannot attribute that to </v>

987
00:51:27.341 --> 00:51:28.174
<v Speaker 2>logic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can just attribute to the fact that </v>

988
00:51:30.581 --> 00:51:31.414
<v Speaker 2>you know that if you are in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation how you would feel and the </v>

989
00:51:33.851 --> 00:51:37.300
<v Speaker 2>first thing you would feel is certainly </v>
<v Speaker 2>not hungry and then turn it off.</v>

990
00:51:37.301 --> 00:51:39.010
<v Speaker 2>Which is an interesting way of thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

991
00:51:39.011 --> 00:51:40.360
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it turned off,</v>

992
00:51:40.361 --> 00:51:44.590
<v Speaker 2>it's essentially a sexual expression </v>
<v Speaker 2>turned off and then you'd feel,</v>

993
00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:49.900
<v Speaker 2>I think you'd feel like a moron so to </v>
<v Speaker 2>speak if you ate it right it to yourself</v>

994
00:51:49.901 --> 00:51:51.730
<v Speaker 2>and to anybody who also happened to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>

995
00:51:51.731 --> 00:51:53.860
<v Speaker 2>There would be something about self </v>
<v Speaker 2>contamination,</v>

996
00:51:54.070 --> 00:51:54.903
<v Speaker 2>voluntary self contamination there that </v>
<v Speaker 2>would make you appear really not very </v>

997
00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:01.420
<v Speaker 2>admirable or honorable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that.</v>

998
00:52:01.750 --> 00:52:04.480
<v Speaker 2>So no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the question becomes,</v>

999
00:52:04.481 --> 00:52:05.314
<v Speaker 2>and this is where things get tricky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just exactly what should you be </v>

1000
00:52:07.781 --> 00:52:08.990
<v Speaker 2>disgusted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bart.</v>

1001
00:52:11.550 --> 00:52:12.383
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1002
00:52:12.740 --> 00:52:16.430
<v Speaker 2>so here's another example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you get people to spit into a,</v>

1003
00:52:16.490 --> 00:52:17.130
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1004
00:52:17.130 --> 00:52:17.963
<v Speaker 2>to put saliva into a cup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will not take it back in their </v>

1005
00:52:20.001 --> 00:52:21.830
<v Speaker 2>mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't you think?</v>

1006
00:52:21.831 --> 00:52:23.440
<v Speaker 2>Well that's kind of strange too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1007
00:52:23.490 --> 00:52:25.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the cup is sterilized,</v>

1008
00:52:25.011 --> 00:52:25.710
<v Speaker 2>we'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

1009
00:52:25.710 --> 00:52:27.290
<v Speaker 2>Sterilized while it was just in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>mouth,</v>

1010
00:52:27.291 --> 00:52:30.530
<v Speaker 2>like half a second before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the Hell is wrong with it now?</v>

1011
00:52:30.740 --> 00:52:33.470
<v Speaker 2>And the answer is it's no longer in your</v>
<v Speaker 2>mouth.</v>

1012
00:52:33.471 --> 00:52:34.820
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's an,</v>

1013
00:52:34.970 --> 00:52:35.803
<v Speaker 2>there's an identification of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>exterior of the body envelope as one of </v>

1014
00:52:39.231 --> 00:52:42.200
<v Speaker 2>the things that defines you and not you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1015
00:52:42.201 --> 00:52:43.034
<v Speaker 2>the immune system per se,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was always defining you and not you </v>

1016
00:52:45.770 --> 00:52:48.530
<v Speaker 2>getting rid of things that aren't you </v>
<v Speaker 2>and keeping the things that are you.</v>

1017
00:52:48.531 --> 00:52:52.280
<v Speaker 2>And that's extended out to our behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can get,</v>

1018
00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:55.700
<v Speaker 2>here's the sorts of things that Jonathan</v>
<v Speaker 2>Haidt has been,</v>

1019
00:52:56.140 --> 00:52:56.973
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>discovering hate was really the guy who </v>

1020
00:52:58.851 --> 00:53:01.310
<v Speaker 2>did the first major work on discussed.</v>

1021
00:53:01.490 --> 00:53:02.450
<v Speaker 2>It's a big deal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1022
00:53:02.451 --> 00:53:04.230
<v Speaker 2>Like two thumbs up for him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1023
00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:09.260
<v Speaker 2>he's discovered something genuine </v>
<v Speaker 2>inducing disgust responses,</v>

1024
00:53:09.261 --> 00:53:11.420
<v Speaker 2>whether via a fall order,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a dis odor,</v>

1025
00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:12.313
<v Speaker 2>a disgusting work environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or we calling it disgusting experience </v>

1026
00:53:14.930 --> 00:53:15.763
<v Speaker 2>led individuals to assign harsher </v>
<v Speaker 2>punishments to others who had committed </v>

1027
00:53:19.101 --> 00:53:19.934
<v Speaker 2>moral transgressions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's interesting because what it </v>

1028
00:53:22.281 --> 00:53:24.410
<v Speaker 2>also means is that the sense of </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussing,</v>

1029
00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:25.393
<v Speaker 2>at least in part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that the core of what we might </v>

1030
00:53:27.211 --> 00:53:32.211
<v Speaker 2>describe as our desire for justice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So which we tend to think as a primary,</v>

1031
00:53:32.231 --> 00:53:33.064
<v Speaker 2>that cognitive thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but most of the things that we do and </v>

1032
00:53:36.001 --> 00:53:39.690
<v Speaker 2>hold dear are not primarily cognitive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're grounded in,</v>

1033
00:53:40.070 --> 00:53:40.903
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomena that are deeply embedded </v>

1034
00:53:43.651 --> 00:53:44.484
<v Speaker 2>within us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Harsh moral judgments can even be </v>

1035
00:53:47.281 --> 00:53:50.220
<v Speaker 2>induced following the consumption of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bitter drink.</v>

1036
00:53:50.670 --> 00:53:53.910
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>poisoning this things are often bitter,</v>

1037
00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:57.030
<v Speaker 2>even though bitter things are sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 2>not poisons.</v>

1038
00:53:57.030 --> 00:53:57.863
<v Speaker 2>And the bitter flavor evokes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>discussed the same disgust related </v>

1039
00:54:01.921 --> 00:54:05.310
<v Speaker 2>facial expressions or observed in </v>
<v Speaker 2>response to unpleasant tastes.</v>

1040
00:54:05.340 --> 00:54:10.290
<v Speaker 2>Disgusting photographs and receiving </v>
<v Speaker 2>unfair treatment in an economic game.</v>

1041
00:54:10.770 --> 00:54:12.780
<v Speaker 2>So that basically means that if you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>playing,</v>

1042
00:54:12.781 --> 00:54:16.500
<v Speaker 2>imagine some kids are playing together </v>
<v Speaker 2>and one of the kids cheats,</v>

1043
00:54:16.860 --> 00:54:17.693
<v Speaker 2>or you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well the other kids are going to be </v>

1044
00:54:18.571 --> 00:54:20.340
<v Speaker 2>angry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or they other kids are going to be upset</v>

1045
00:54:20.341 --> 00:54:21.174
<v Speaker 2>or the other kids are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>anxious because they've upset the </v>

1046
00:54:22.531 --> 00:54:23.700
<v Speaker 2>structure of the game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1047
00:54:23.701 --> 00:54:25.290
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe all those things happen,</v>

1048
00:54:25.950 --> 00:54:28.500
<v Speaker 2>but one thing that happens as well as </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussed,</v>

1049
00:54:28.830 --> 00:54:32.040
<v Speaker 2>it's like how could you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then of course if you're disgusting,</v>

1050
00:54:32.190 --> 00:54:33.023
<v Speaker 2>the probability that you're going to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>shunted out of the dominance hierarchy </v>

1051
00:54:35.551 --> 00:54:37.290
<v Speaker 2>all together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty damn high.</v>

1052
00:54:39.770 --> 00:54:43.130
<v Speaker 2>Concerns about cleanliness and feelings </v>
<v Speaker 2>of disgust have likewise been related to</v>

1053
00:54:43.131 --> 00:54:43.964
<v Speaker 2>political attitudes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>situational reminders of the importance </v>

1054
00:54:47.211 --> 00:54:48.044
<v Speaker 2>of physical cleanliness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>such as asking participants to wipe </v>

1055
00:54:50.721 --> 00:54:51.554
<v Speaker 2>their hands with antiseptic wipes tends </v>
<v Speaker 2>to increase self-reported political </v>

1056
00:54:55.281 --> 00:54:56.114
<v Speaker 2>conservatism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Such a finding is consistent with the </v>

1057
00:54:59.061 --> 00:54:59.894
<v Speaker 2>notion that purity tends to be valued </v>
<v Speaker 2>more highly by conservatives then by </v>

1058
00:55:03.921 --> 00:55:08.240
<v Speaker 2>liberals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well for much of human history,</v>

1059
00:55:09.290 --> 00:55:10.123
<v Speaker 2>female virginity in particular was </v>
<v Speaker 2>highly valued and sometimes the </v>

1060
00:55:13.641 --> 00:55:18.470
<v Speaker 2>punishments for deviating from that were</v>
<v Speaker 2>and still can be extraordinarily high.</v>

1061
00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:23.360
<v Speaker 2>Well part of the reason why you might </v>
<v Speaker 2>ask why precisely is that,</v>

1062
00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:27.410
<v Speaker 2>and part of the reason is an exaggerated</v>
<v Speaker 2>disgust response.</v>

1063
00:55:28.790 --> 00:55:29.623
<v Speaker 2>Individuals who report being disgusted </v>
<v Speaker 2>more easily also tend to hold more </v>

1064
00:55:33.291 --> 00:55:36.080
<v Speaker 2>conservative political views on topics </v>
<v Speaker 2>including abortion,</v>

1065
00:55:36.081 --> 00:55:37.280
<v Speaker 2>gay marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tax cuts,</v>

1066
00:55:37.281 --> 00:55:38.114
<v Speaker 2>and affirmative action.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In addition to the effects that have </v>

1067
00:55:40.311 --> 00:55:43.010
<v Speaker 2>emerged when using self reported disgust</v>
<v Speaker 2>sensitivity,</v>

1068
00:55:43.190 --> 00:55:44.023
<v Speaker 2>more conservative political views have </v>
<v Speaker 2>also been associated with stronger </v>

1069
00:55:46.461 --> 00:55:49.820
<v Speaker 2>physiological reactivity to disgusting </v>
<v Speaker 2>images.</v>

1070
00:56:05.050 --> 00:56:05.883
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So preferences for order and tradition </v>

1071
00:56:07.811 --> 00:56:12.010
<v Speaker 2>on the one hand in preferences for </v>
<v Speaker 2>egalitarianism on the other appear to be</v>

1072
00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:16.200
<v Speaker 2>taking be related to two core dimensions</v>
<v Speaker 2>of moral value.</v>

1073
00:56:16.310 --> 00:56:17.143
<v Speaker 2>So the um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>preferences for order and tradition are </v>

1074
00:56:20.351 --> 00:56:22.690
<v Speaker 2>associated with higher levels of </v>
<v Speaker 2>orderliness and</v>

1075
00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:25.233
<v Speaker 2>as well as lower levels of openness and </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellect and preferences for </v>

1076
00:56:27.611 --> 00:56:28.444
<v Speaker 2>egalitarianism are uniquely associated </v>
<v Speaker 2>with compassion and aspect of </v>

1077
00:56:31.541 --> 00:56:32.380
<v Speaker 2>agreeableness.</v>

1078
00:56:34.570 --> 00:56:35.403
<v Speaker 2>Political conservatism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now this is where the claims get </v>

1079
00:56:38.050 --> 00:56:38.883
<v Speaker 2>frightening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think political conservatism can be </v>

1080
00:56:40.991 --> 00:56:41.824
<v Speaker 2>thought of as a social immune system </v>
<v Speaker 2>reflecting the extension of pathogen </v>

1081
00:56:45.011 --> 00:56:49.210
<v Speaker 2>avoidance mechanisms to the integrity of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the social system just as the behavioral</v>

1082
00:56:49.211 --> 00:56:50.044
<v Speaker 2>immune system has been conceptualized as</v>
<v Speaker 2>helping to maintain the purity and </v>

1083
00:56:52.811 --> 00:56:53.644
<v Speaker 2>integrity of an individual body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to me the same pathogen avoidance </v>

1084
00:56:56.621 --> 00:56:57.454
<v Speaker 2>system helped me in the abstract </v>
<v Speaker 2>integrity of the social order in </v>

1085
00:57:00.461 --> 00:57:01.294
<v Speaker 2>particular to the social immune system </v>
<v Speaker 2>would help to maintain order by </v>

1086
00:57:03.431 --> 00:57:04.264
<v Speaker 2>suppressing any actions or individuals </v>
<v Speaker 2>that deviate from a group's accepted </v>

1087
00:57:07.001 --> 00:57:09.760
<v Speaker 2>social traditions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1088
00:57:09.790 --> 00:57:13.780
<v Speaker 2>Now we're going to make a bit of a segue</v>
<v Speaker 2>here from this.</v>

1089
00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:15.850
<v Speaker 2>It has been reported,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>

1090
00:57:15.851 --> 00:57:19.720
<v Speaker 2>that that regions with higher levels of </v>
<v Speaker 2>disease prevalence tend to be associated</v>

1091
00:57:19.721 --> 00:57:23.050
<v Speaker 2>with higher levels of social conformity </v>
<v Speaker 2>and autocratic rule.</v>

1092
00:57:23.230 --> 00:57:26.890
<v Speaker 2>Individuals who feel more vulnerable to </v>
<v Speaker 2>disease likewise report higher levels of</v>

1093
00:57:26.891 --> 00:57:28.560
<v Speaker 2>ethnocentrism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>xenophobia,</v>

1094
00:57:28.810 --> 00:57:30.820
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's something else to consider.</v>

1095
00:57:31.210 --> 00:57:33.700
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you know this,</v>

1096
00:57:34.330 --> 00:57:39.330
<v Speaker 2>but when the Spaniards landed in Central</v>
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>

1097
00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:42.193
<v Speaker 1>they had</v>

1098
00:57:42.620 --> 00:57:46.820
<v Speaker 2>being from a European population that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was punched and traded in cities,</v>

1099
00:57:47.060 --> 00:57:49.940
<v Speaker 2>and the cities were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from our perspective,</v>

1100
00:57:50.180 --> 00:57:51.013
<v Speaker 2>disgusting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>filthy close proximity with animals and </v>

1101
00:57:55.940 --> 00:57:59.180
<v Speaker 2>subject to continual waves of epidemic </v>
<v Speaker 2>disease.</v>

1102
00:57:59.420 --> 00:58:01.730
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the upside of that for the Europeans was</v>

1103
00:58:01.731 --> 00:58:02.564
<v Speaker 2>that all the ones that didn't die </v>
<v Speaker 2>developed immunity to these various </v>

1104
00:58:06.261 --> 00:58:07.790
<v Speaker 2>diseases even know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1105
00:58:09.170 --> 00:58:13.520
<v Speaker 2>I would suspect that over time it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>the majority of people who died from one</v>

1106
00:58:13.521 --> 00:58:16.400
<v Speaker 2>epidemic disease or another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1107
00:58:16.401 --> 00:58:19.580
<v Speaker 2>so then the Spaniards went to the new </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

1108
00:58:19.730 --> 00:58:22.550
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for one reason or another,</v>

1109
00:58:22.551 --> 00:58:25.160
<v Speaker 2>there were hardly any epidemic diseases </v>
<v Speaker 2>in North America.</v>

1110
00:58:25.161 --> 00:58:25.994
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was partly because of a relative </v>

1111
00:58:27.171 --> 00:58:28.004
<v Speaker 2>dearth of domestic animals and partly </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there weren't as many big </v>

1112
00:58:30.531 --> 00:58:32.540
<v Speaker 2>closely packed cities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

1113
00:58:32.541 --> 00:58:35.030
<v Speaker 2>God only knows what the overall reason </v>
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>

1114
00:58:35.780 --> 00:58:36.680
<v Speaker 2>So what happened?</v>

1115
00:58:37.790 --> 00:58:38.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1116
00:58:38.410 --> 00:58:42.400
<v Speaker 2>all the native Americans died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>95% of them.</v>

1117
00:58:43.380 --> 00:58:45.730
<v Speaker 2>They died from smallpox.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They died from measles.</v>

1118
00:58:45.731 --> 00:58:47.410
<v Speaker 2>They died from mumps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1119
00:58:47.411 --> 00:58:52.150
<v Speaker 2>guide from chicken pox in successive </v>
<v Speaker 2>waves of epidemic,</v>

1120
00:58:53.140 --> 00:58:57.060
<v Speaker 2>demolish mint centered in Central </v>
<v Speaker 2>American rating.</v>

1121
00:58:57.061 --> 00:58:58.930
<v Speaker 2>I would all across North American,</v>
<v Speaker 2>South America,</v>

1122
00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:01.810
<v Speaker 2>so that by the time the Europeans landed</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1123
00:59:01.990 --> 00:59:04.840
<v Speaker 2>because the Spaniards got there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say in the late 14 hundreds right,</v>

1124
00:59:04.870 --> 00:59:09.010
<v Speaker 2>early 15 hundreds and so the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people who landed at Plymouth Rock,</v>

1125
00:59:09.011 --> 00:59:09.844
<v Speaker 2>and that's kind of often what you think </v>
<v Speaker 2>about as the beginning of the European </v>

1126
00:59:12.910 --> 00:59:16.600
<v Speaker 2>colonization of North America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was like a hundred years later.</v>

1127
00:59:17.350 --> 00:59:18.730
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone was dead by then.</v>

1128
00:59:19.510 --> 00:59:21.320
<v Speaker 2>And their reports that when the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the,</v>

1129
00:59:21.380 --> 00:59:25.700
<v Speaker 2>when the white settlers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that religious escapees really landed at</v>

1130
00:59:25.701 --> 00:59:27.060
<v Speaker 2>Plymouth Rock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the data's,</v>

1131
00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:27.913
<v Speaker 2>we're happy to see them because there </v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't enough people left bringing in </v>

1132
00:59:29.590 --> 00:59:30.423
<v Speaker 2>the crops.</v>

1133
00:59:31.900 --> 00:59:34.090
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so why am I telling you this?</v>

1134
00:59:34.091 --> 00:59:34.924
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in return syphilis was delivered to </v>

1135
00:59:36.730 --> 00:59:38.230
<v Speaker 2>Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least that's the theory,</v>

1136
00:59:38.770 --> 00:59:40.470
<v Speaker 2>although it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1137
00:59:41.050 --> 00:59:41.883
<v Speaker 2>there isn't any certainty about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it seemed to appear at about the </v>

1138
00:59:43.931 --> 00:59:46.390
<v Speaker 2>same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the Europeans brought endless numbers</v>

1139
00:59:46.391 --> 00:59:47.224
<v Speaker 2>of horrible diseases to the new world </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the new world returned the </v>

1140
00:59:50.141 --> 00:59:52.750
<v Speaker 2>favor with one horrible disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's a point here,</v>

1141
00:59:53.260 --> 00:59:54.790
<v Speaker 2>while I'm still in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this still happens.</v>

1142
00:59:54.791 --> 00:59:57.710
<v Speaker 2>So if you go into the Amazon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you find your tribe that you know,</v>

1143
00:59:57.740 --> 00:59:58.573
<v Speaker 2>hasn't been discovered yet or anywhere </v>
<v Speaker 2>else in the world and you go up and you </v>

1144
01:00:01.091 --> 01:00:02.050
<v Speaker 2>shake their hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1145
01:00:02.051 --> 01:00:04.210
<v Speaker 2>that's great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're all dancing like a month.</v>

1146
01:00:05.110 --> 01:00:07.690
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so why is this important?</v>

1147
01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:08.973
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't know how often this sort of </v>

1148
01:00:10.421 --> 01:00:11.254
<v Speaker 2>thing has happened in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it could easily be the case that </v>

1149
01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:15.333
<v Speaker 2>part of the reason that people are leery</v>
<v Speaker 2>of people who aren't like them is </v>

1150
01:00:18.371 --> 01:00:21.790
<v Speaker 2>because over our evolutionary of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>course of our evolutionary history,</v>

1151
01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:25.420
<v Speaker 2>it was at least moderately probable that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you read.</v>

1152
01:00:25.450 --> 01:00:26.283
<v Speaker 2>If you ran into another group of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if they didn't kill you and you </v>

1153
01:00:29.501 --> 01:00:30.334
<v Speaker 2>immediately went to war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the mere contact would devastate </v>

1154
01:00:33.851 --> 01:00:34.690
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1155
01:00:34.691 --> 01:00:37.990
<v Speaker 2>And you can imagine how that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing would be attributed to things like</v>

1156
01:00:37.991 --> 01:00:41.920
<v Speaker 2>magical power of curses or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever have you when people are trying</v>

1157
01:00:41.921 --> 01:00:44.320
<v Speaker 2>to strive for an explanation for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomenon.</v>

1158
01:00:45.130 --> 01:00:48.580
<v Speaker 2>So that's a nasty little idea.</v>

1159
01:00:50.830 --> 01:00:52.210
<v Speaker 2>Now check this out.</v>

1160
01:00:56.860 --> 01:00:57.380
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1161
01:00:57.380 --> 01:00:58.430
<v Speaker 2>So this study,</v>

1162
01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:05.950
<v Speaker 2>according to a parasite stress </v>
<v Speaker 2>hypothesis,</v>

1163
01:01:05.951 --> 01:01:06.784
<v Speaker 2>authoritarian governments are more </v>
<v Speaker 2>likely to emerge in regions </v>

1164
01:01:08.771 --> 01:01:12.190
<v Speaker 2>characterized by a high prevalence of </v>
<v Speaker 2>disease causing pathogens.</v>

1165
01:01:12.370 --> 01:01:15.820
<v Speaker 2>Recent cross national evidence is </v>
<v Speaker 2>consistent with this hypothesis,</v>

1166
01:01:16.030 --> 01:01:19.180
<v Speaker 2>but there are inferential limitations </v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with that evidence.</v>

1167
01:01:19.390 --> 01:01:22.960
<v Speaker 2>We report to studies that address some </v>
<v Speaker 2>of these limitations and provide further</v>

1168
01:01:22.961 --> 01:01:23.794
<v Speaker 2>tests of the hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Study one revealed that parasite </v>

1169
01:01:27.790 --> 01:01:28.623
<v Speaker 2>prevalence strongly predicted cross </v>
<v Speaker 2>national differences on measures </v>

1170
01:01:31.331 --> 01:01:32.164
<v Speaker 2>assessing individual's authoritarian </v>
<v Speaker 2>personalities and that this affects the </v>

1171
01:01:35.381 --> 01:01:39.280
<v Speaker 2>tedious statistically mediated the </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship between parasite prevalence</v>

1172
01:01:39.281 --> 01:01:41.110
<v Speaker 2>and authoritarian governance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1173
01:01:41.111 --> 01:01:44.320
<v Speaker 2>so let's unpack that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does it mean more disease?</v>

1174
01:01:44.620 --> 01:01:49.620
<v Speaker 2>The more the people are authoritarian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more the people are authoritarian at</v>

1175
01:01:49.751 --> 01:01:50.584
<v Speaker 2>the local level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the level of their individual </v>

1176
01:01:51.941 --> 01:01:52.774
<v Speaker 2>beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more likely the government is to be </v>

1177
01:01:54.251 --> 01:01:56.590
<v Speaker 2>authoritarian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's disease,</v>

1178
01:01:57.970 --> 01:02:01.030
<v Speaker 2>individual government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1179
01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:02.193
<v Speaker 2>So that's really something</v>
<v Speaker 2>study to tested the parasite stress </v>

1180
01:02:06.341 --> 01:02:06.970
<v Speaker 2>hypothesis.</v>

1181
01:02:06.970 --> 01:02:09.640
<v Speaker 2>In a sample of traditional small scale </v>
<v Speaker 2>societies,</v>

1182
01:02:09.910 --> 01:02:10.743
<v Speaker 2>revolt results revealed that parasite </v>
<v Speaker 2>prevalence predicted measures of </v>

1183
01:02:14.021 --> 01:02:14.854
<v Speaker 2>authoritarian governance and did so </v>
<v Speaker 2>evenly when even when statistically </v>

1184
01:02:18.191 --> 01:02:21.090
<v Speaker 2>controlling for threats to human </v>
<v Speaker 2>welfare,</v>

1185
01:02:21.630 --> 01:02:25.140
<v Speaker 2>what additional threat famine also </v>
<v Speaker 2>uniquely predicted.</v>

1186
01:02:25.141 --> 01:02:26.910
<v Speaker 2>Authoritarianism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1187
01:02:26.911 --> 01:02:30.390
<v Speaker 2>But I should also point out that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>historical reasons for famine,</v>

1188
01:02:30.391 --> 01:02:31.224
<v Speaker 2>we're often tightly associated with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>historical reasons for disease </v>

1189
01:02:34.081 --> 01:02:34.920
<v Speaker 2>prevalence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

1190
01:02:34.921 --> 01:02:35.754
<v Speaker 2>if you were invaded by rats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are going to eat everything that </v>

1191
01:02:37.951 --> 01:02:38.784
<v Speaker 2>you produced and the probability that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to bring disease along </v>

1192
01:02:40.651 --> 01:02:44.310
<v Speaker 2>with them was pretty damn high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But look at the correlations together.</v>

1193
01:02:44.311 --> 01:02:45.144
<v Speaker 2>These results further substantiate the </v>
<v Speaker 2>parasite stress hypothesis of </v>

1194
01:02:47.671 --> 01:02:48.504
<v Speaker 2>authoritarianism and suggested societal </v>
<v Speaker 2>differences in authoritarian governance </v>

1195
01:02:51.811 --> 01:02:52.644
<v Speaker 2>result in part from cultural differences</v>
<v Speaker 2>and individual's authoritarian </v>

1196
01:02:55.381 --> 01:02:57.930
<v Speaker 2>personalities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1197
01:02:58.080 --> 01:02:58.913
<v Speaker 2>What's the correlation between </v>
<v Speaker 2>authoritarian governance and pathogen </v>

1198
01:03:01.441 --> 01:03:02.274
<v Speaker 2>prevalence?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Point four to remember what we said </v>

1199
01:03:04.771 --> 01:03:06.630
<v Speaker 2>about effect sizes.</v>

1200
01:03:06.780 --> 01:03:11.010
<v Speaker 2>That's as powerful an effect as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship between Iq and grades.</v>

1201
01:03:11.730 --> 01:03:13.530
<v Speaker 2>It's a whopping effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1202
01:03:13.531 --> 01:03:16.290
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of error in these </v>
<v Speaker 2>measurements so you can be sure that the</v>

1203
01:03:16.291 --> 01:03:17.124
<v Speaker 2>true correlation is higher</v>
<v Speaker 2>famine was also associated with </v>

1204
01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:23.970
<v Speaker 2>authoritarian governance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1205
01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:29.250
<v Speaker 2>so wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read that paper and I thought really,</v>

1206
01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:31.860
<v Speaker 2>could that really be the case?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what happens is that,</v>

1207
01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:36.000
<v Speaker 2>especially as the incidents of </v>
<v Speaker 2>transmissible diseases increase,</v>

1208
01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:38.670
<v Speaker 2>people clamp down on their moral </v>
<v Speaker 2>structures.</v>

1209
01:03:38.671 --> 01:03:39.504
<v Speaker 2>They don't let you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't allow contact between each </v>

1210
01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:44.093
<v Speaker 2>between.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They tightened the borders at every </v>

1211
01:03:45.781 --> 01:03:47.340
<v Speaker 2>level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at every level.</v>

1212
01:03:47.610 --> 01:03:49.080
<v Speaker 2>Sexual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>personal,</v>

1213
01:03:49.650 --> 01:03:52.260
<v Speaker 2>familial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the level of the village,</v>

1214
01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:55.170
<v Speaker 2>at the level of the state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they closed the borders.</v>

1215
01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:56.033
<v Speaker 2>You know when you can think of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimate border as the surface of your </v>

1216
01:03:58.111 --> 01:04:00.420
<v Speaker 2>skin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know it is very few people.</v>

1217
01:04:00.630 --> 01:04:01.463
<v Speaker 2>There are very few people who believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>that border should be so open that they </v>

1218
01:04:04.981 --> 01:04:08.940
<v Speaker 2>don't want control over the border of </v>
<v Speaker 2>their own skin.</v>

1219
01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:10.770
<v Speaker 2>And then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1220
01:04:10.771 --> 01:04:13.500
<v Speaker 2>how far out should that be extended in?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The answer to that is,</v>

1221
01:04:13.501 --> 01:04:14.580
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's debatable,</v>

1222
01:04:15.150 --> 01:04:15.983
<v Speaker 2>but there's obviously a limit on</v>
<v Speaker 2>universality of access and there's </v>

1223
01:04:22.801 --> 01:04:24.150
<v Speaker 2>reason for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1224
01:04:24.151 --> 01:04:26.700
<v Speaker 2>there's multiple reasons for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this appears to be one of them.</v>

1225
01:04:27.270 --> 01:04:29.010
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that indicates,</v>

1226
01:04:29.011 --> 01:04:31.800
<v Speaker 2>and this is mind boggling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who would have guessed this,</v>

1227
01:04:32.070 --> 01:04:32.903
<v Speaker 2>is that perhaps the best way to fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>authoritarianism across the world is to </v>

1228
01:04:36.241 --> 01:04:37.074
<v Speaker 2>institute effective public health </v>
<v Speaker 2>programs and get rid of the infectious </v>

1229
01:04:39.241 --> 01:04:41.550
<v Speaker 2>diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now who would have guessed that?</v>

1230
01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:42.780
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1231
01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:43.613
<v Speaker 2>it makes sense to some degree if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the general level of danger and </v>

1232
01:04:48.151 --> 01:04:48.984
<v Speaker 2>threat is actually lowered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe people don't have to be so </v>

1233
01:04:51.781 --> 01:04:56.220
<v Speaker 2>defensive and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a judgmental and,</v>

1234
01:04:56.490 --> 01:04:59.610
<v Speaker 2>and xenophobic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1235
01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:01.433
<v Speaker 2>we think often that it's political </v>
<v Speaker 2>argumentation that does this sort of </v>

1236
01:05:03.661 --> 01:05:03.960
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

1237
01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:06.420
<v Speaker 2>But</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1238
01:05:06.421 --> 01:05:09.390
<v Speaker 2>there's no malaria in North America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no malaria in Europe.</v>

1239
01:05:09.510 --> 01:05:11.010
<v Speaker 2>There was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1240
01:05:11.011 --> 01:05:12.630
<v Speaker 2>200 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Washington,</v>

1241
01:05:12.631 --> 01:05:15.090
<v Speaker 2>Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those places were malarial pits,</v>

1242
01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:17.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was public health that got rid of</v>

1243
01:05:17.751 --> 01:05:18.584
<v Speaker 2>almost all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe we're all liberal and friendly </v>

1244
01:05:20.751 --> 01:05:23.780
<v Speaker 2>because we don't have any infectious </v>
<v Speaker 2>diseases would not be something.</v>

1245
01:05:25.490 --> 01:05:27.320
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our 0.42 correlation,</v>

1246
01:05:27.321 --> 01:05:30.170
<v Speaker 2>this was a big study too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a big correlation.</v>

1247
01:05:30.171 --> 01:05:32.990
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen a correlation like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially Laura.</v>

1248
01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:36.380
<v Speaker 2>Think about the probability that those </v>
<v Speaker 2>things would be related.</v>

1249
01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:37.303
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is the self report measure of political </v>

1250
01:05:38.751 --> 01:05:41.270
<v Speaker 2>belief.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the other is a public health measure</v>

1251
01:05:41.271 --> 01:05:42.104
<v Speaker 2>of disease prevalence and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>probability that those things would be </v>

1252
01:05:44.781 --> 01:05:46.880
<v Speaker 2>associated just fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1253
01:05:46.970 --> 01:05:50.990
<v Speaker 2>you would just never guess that unless </v>
<v Speaker 2>you came to it the hard way through this</v>

1254
01:05:50.991 --> 01:05:54.650
<v Speaker 2>entire logic that we just discussed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1255
01:05:55.230 --> 01:05:56.063
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1256
01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:03.890
<v Speaker 2>so while I was going through this </v>
<v Speaker 2>literature,</v>

1257
01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:08.590
<v Speaker 2>I was also reading Hitler's table talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Hitler's table talk was a collection</v>

1258
01:06:08.591 --> 01:06:09.424
<v Speaker 2>of his spontaneous speeches delivered </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the dinner table from 1939 to 1942 </v>

1259
01:06:15.191 --> 01:06:18.070
<v Speaker 2>which was roughly the period where the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nazis were winning the war.</v>

1260
01:06:18.580 --> 01:06:22.300
<v Speaker 2>And I noticed something that I haven't </v>
<v Speaker 2>noticed before and what I noticed before</v>

1261
01:06:22.301 --> 01:06:26.800
<v Speaker 2>was that Hitler had a very powerful </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavioral immune system.</v>

1262
01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:29.440
<v Speaker 2>And so what did that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

1263
01:06:29.441 --> 01:06:32.050
<v Speaker 2>you often hear that the Nazis </v>
<v Speaker 2>annihilated that.</v>

1264
01:06:32.051 --> 01:06:35.470
<v Speaker 2>The people that they annihilated because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were afraid of them,</v>

1265
01:06:35.590 --> 01:06:38.140
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you then you think about Nazis,</v>

1266
01:06:38.141 --> 01:06:39.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you think,</v>

1267
01:06:39.490 --> 01:06:41.500
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe fear wasn't there.</v>

1268
01:06:41.501 --> 01:06:43.990
<v Speaker 2>Overwhelming characteristic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1269
01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:46.810
<v Speaker 2>it's some more like brutality or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>

1270
01:06:46.811 --> 01:06:50.320
<v Speaker 2>but it's not fear then you don't picture</v>
<v Speaker 2>them trembling in their boots,</v>

1271
01:06:50.321 --> 01:06:51.154
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>down in the basement or something like </v>

1272
01:06:52.121 --> 01:06:52.330
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1273
01:06:52.330 --> 01:06:54.430
<v Speaker 2>It's not that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1274
01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:55.990
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

1275
01:06:55.991 --> 01:07:00.991
<v Speaker 2>so I was reading his book and Hitler was</v>
<v Speaker 2>very high in openness by the way,</v>

1276
01:07:03.070 --> 01:07:05.410
<v Speaker 2>and very high in orderliness by all </v>
<v Speaker 2>appearances.</v>

1277
01:07:05.411 --> 01:07:08.980
<v Speaker 2>And so he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his vision for the area in race,</v>

1278
01:07:08.981 --> 01:07:10.810
<v Speaker 2>so he had this race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>racial theory,</v>

1279
01:07:10.811 --> 01:07:11.644
<v Speaker 2>right in the racial theory was that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>proper inhabitants of Europe and </v>

1280
01:07:14.530 --> 01:07:18.470
<v Speaker 2>hypothetically the world were blonde,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blue eyed ariens,</v>

1281
01:07:19.930 --> 01:07:23.080
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really not a category and that,</v>

1282
01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:24.873
<v Speaker 2>and that it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world would be a better place if </v>

1283
01:07:26.980 --> 01:07:30.820
<v Speaker 2>they were the dominant group and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the other groups were gone.</v>

1284
01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:32.193
<v Speaker 2>Also then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well how did Hitler conceptualize this </v>

1285
01:07:34.811 --> 01:07:35.644
<v Speaker 2>area in race?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the answer is he conceptualized it </v>

1286
01:07:37.811 --> 01:07:38.644
<v Speaker 2>as a body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the body of it was the body of </v>

1287
01:07:42.011 --> 01:07:42.844
<v Speaker 2>the area in race.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he conceptualized all the </v>

1288
01:07:44.771 --> 01:07:49.180
<v Speaker 2>people that he was out to annihilate as </v>
<v Speaker 2>parasitical invaders.</v>

1289
01:07:49.810 --> 01:07:54.810
<v Speaker 2>And so Hitler's metaphor for the Nazi </v>
<v Speaker 2>genocide wasn't fear.</v>

1290
01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:58.480
<v Speaker 2>It was discussed.</v>

1291
01:07:59.550 --> 01:08:00.383
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1292
01:08:00.460 --> 01:08:05.460
<v Speaker 2>And that's a whole different idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now let me tell you some things about,</v>

1293
01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:06.580
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1294
01:08:06.580 --> 01:08:09.100
<v Speaker 2>with regards to the orderly part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1295
01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:10.480
<v Speaker 2>you can just check out the,</v>

1296
01:08:12.830 --> 01:08:13.663
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1297
01:08:18.710 --> 01:08:19.543
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just not going to see a more </v>

1298
01:08:20.721 --> 01:08:21.554
<v Speaker 2>orderly gathering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The people then the picture on the </v>

1299
01:08:22.821 --> 01:08:24.110
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1300
01:08:24.530 --> 01:08:27.810
<v Speaker 2>at Nuremberg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was the prime place where the Nazi</v>

1301
01:08:27.811 --> 01:08:28.644
<v Speaker 2>staged their celebrations was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>biggest gathering field ever made in </v>

1302
01:08:33.471 --> 01:08:34.304
<v Speaker 2>human history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People arrange themselves hundreds of </v>

1303
01:08:37.010 --> 01:08:40.070
<v Speaker 2>thousands of people into perfect </v>
<v Speaker 2>squares,</v>

1304
01:08:40.190 --> 01:08:42.400
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you remember that Jack boot,</v>

1305
01:08:42.750 --> 01:08:43.583
<v Speaker 2>a goose step march and the Hail Hitler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's all done an absolutely </v>

1306
01:08:48.051 --> 01:08:52.130
<v Speaker 2>perfect sequence and Hitler was a great </v>
<v Speaker 2>admirer of willpower.</v>

1307
01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:53.113
<v Speaker 2>He was very happy that he could stand in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the back of his car for eight hours and </v>

1308
01:08:55.851 --> 01:08:59.150
<v Speaker 2>keep his hand out like this and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>bathed four times a day.</v>

1309
01:09:00.650 --> 01:09:01.483
<v Speaker 2>So what you saw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what seems to have driven what happened </v>

1310
01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:06.223
<v Speaker 2>in Nazi Germany and perhaps is one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the things that drive right wing </v>

1311
01:09:10.460 --> 01:09:15.020
<v Speaker 2>political movements to this day is </v>
<v Speaker 2>heightened sensitivity to discussed.</v>

1312
01:09:17.230 --> 01:09:18.063
<v Speaker 2>Now here's how it all got going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is a very brief overview and </v>

1313
01:09:21.281 --> 01:09:24.730
<v Speaker 2>many other things happened when Hitler </v>
<v Speaker 2>came to power.</v>

1314
01:09:24.731 --> 01:09:25.564
<v Speaker 2>And that was about 1933 thereabouts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He put into place a variety of public </v>

1315
01:09:29.921 --> 01:09:32.950
<v Speaker 2>health initiatives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of them for example,</v>

1316
01:09:32.951 --> 01:09:36.460
<v Speaker 2>was he built these vans that had x ray </v>
<v Speaker 2>machines.</v>

1317
01:09:36.461 --> 01:09:37.294
<v Speaker 2>And then when he went around everywhere </v>
<v Speaker 2>and screen people for tuberculosis </v>

1318
01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:41.500
<v Speaker 2>seemed like a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1319
01:09:41.501 --> 01:09:46.210
<v Speaker 2>And then one of the things he did after </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was go on a factory beautification,</v>

1320
01:09:46.780 --> 01:09:48.640
<v Speaker 2>a binge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>

1321
01:09:48.641 --> 01:09:49.474
<v Speaker 2>And so partly that was driven by </v>
<v Speaker 2>openness because he wanted things to be </v>

1322
01:09:52.031 --> 01:09:52.864
<v Speaker 2>aesthetically pleasing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of it was driven by </v>

1323
01:09:54.281 --> 01:09:55.114
<v Speaker 2>orderliness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you're supposed to go into your </v>

1324
01:09:56.411 --> 01:09:57.244
<v Speaker 2>factory and sweep the damn thing out and</v>
<v Speaker 2>fix the yard in front of it and plant </v>

1325
01:10:00.161 --> 01:10:03.490
<v Speaker 2>some flowers and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make it a look all nice and suburban and</v>

1326
01:10:03.491 --> 01:10:04.480
<v Speaker 2>under control.</v>

1327
01:10:05.140 --> 01:10:06.160
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was,</v>

1328
01:10:06.161 --> 01:10:08.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe still not such a bad idea.</v>

1329
01:10:08.860 --> 01:10:11.920
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you go into your factory,</v>

1330
01:10:11.921 --> 01:10:12.754
<v Speaker 2>while there's rats there and there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like bugs and things that shouldn't be </v>

1331
01:10:14.951 --> 01:10:16.000
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so maybe you think,</v>

1332
01:10:16.001 --> 01:10:17.740
<v Speaker 2>well let's get rid of the rats and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bugs.</v>

1333
01:10:17.741 --> 01:10:22.741
<v Speaker 2>And so then you use an insecticide spray</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not spray happened to be Zyklon B,</v>

1334
01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:26.230
<v Speaker 2>which we'll return to momentarily while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So after that,</v>

1335
01:10:26.231 --> 01:10:29.800
<v Speaker 2>then Hitler went on a euthanasia kick </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was sort of like,</v>

1336
01:10:29.801 --> 01:10:33.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can get rid of the people who are not</v>

1337
01:10:33.491 --> 01:10:35.410
<v Speaker 2>contributing and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are</v>

1338
01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:39.280
<v Speaker 2>not fit to live,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shall we say.</v>

1339
01:10:40.030 --> 01:10:43.450
<v Speaker 2>And so that started with euthanasia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it started with people who are in</v>

1340
01:10:43.451 --> 01:10:44.284
<v Speaker 2>mental hospitals for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people who had biological </v>

1341
01:10:47.081 --> 01:10:47.914
<v Speaker 2>intellectual deficits in such.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And from there it went to people have </v>

1342
01:10:52.971 --> 01:10:55.730
<v Speaker 2>the wrong religious tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And from there,</v>

1343
01:10:55.731 --> 01:10:58.960
<v Speaker 2>and that was first of all only being </v>
<v Speaker 2>rounded up and herded into council,</v>

1344
01:10:58.961 --> 01:10:59.794
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or first deprived of your property and </v>

1345
01:11:01.250 --> 01:11:04.100
<v Speaker 2>of your identity and then rounded up and</v>
<v Speaker 2>put and put into camps.</v>

1346
01:11:04.310 --> 01:11:05.143
<v Speaker 2>But what it ended up with was genocidal </v>
<v Speaker 2>and isolation in gas chambers with </v>

1347
01:11:10.011 --> 01:11:12.830
<v Speaker 2>Zyklon B.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1348
01:11:13.140 --> 01:11:14.100
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1349
01:11:14.101 --> 01:11:19.101
<v Speaker 2>the Nazis would describe the people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were tormenting as parasites and as</v>

1350
01:11:20.670 --> 01:11:25.670
<v Speaker 2>insects and as rats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's not fear language,</v>

1351
01:11:26.970 --> 01:11:31.890
<v Speaker 2>that's discussed language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's an appalling</v>

1352
01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:35.933
<v Speaker 2>paradox because the behavioral immune </v>
<v Speaker 2>system along with the immune system is </v>

1353
01:11:39.961 --> 01:11:40.794
<v Speaker 2>clearly designed to stop people from </v>
<v Speaker 2>dying right in your immune system </v>

1354
01:11:45.991 --> 01:11:49.710
<v Speaker 2>distinguishes between you and not you </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you do the same thing at many levels</v>

1355
01:11:49.711 --> 01:11:51.480
<v Speaker 2>of behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially sexually.</v>

1356
01:11:51.750 --> 01:11:54.690
<v Speaker 2>And you know who's going to say that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's anything wrong with that.</v>

1357
01:11:54.691 --> 01:11:55.524
<v Speaker 2>It's the same thing when you try to keep</v>
<v Speaker 2>your bathroom cleaned in your kitchen </v>

1358
01:11:57.481 --> 01:12:00.240
<v Speaker 2>clean and the city streets cleaned in </v>
<v Speaker 2>all of that and you think,</v>

1359
01:12:00.241 --> 01:12:01.860
<v Speaker 2>well that's all for the good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1360
01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:04.110
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but look what happens when that gets out</v>

1361
01:12:04.111 --> 01:12:05.910
<v Speaker 2>of control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1362
01:12:05.911 --> 01:12:08.550
<v Speaker 2>And that's a terrible thing in a sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's,</v>

1363
01:12:08.810 --> 01:12:09.643
<v Speaker 2>it's one thing if something that's bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>in and of itself gets out of hand and </v>

1364
01:12:13.801 --> 01:12:14.634
<v Speaker 2>then make something really bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's really a whole different </v>

1365
01:12:16.621 --> 01:12:20.340
<v Speaker 2>category of awful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When something appears to be pretty much</v>

1366
01:12:20.460 --> 01:12:21.293
<v Speaker 2>are only for benefit and it gets out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>control and it gets so horrible that it </v>

1367
01:12:24.991 --> 01:12:28.050
<v Speaker 2>produces a worse effects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the effects that it was designed to</v>

1368
01:12:28.051 --> 01:12:28.884
<v Speaker 2>prevent.</v>

1369
01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:39.350
<v Speaker 2>I want to just show you a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>a film that goes along with this.</v>

1370
01:12:39.900 --> 01:12:40.733
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is an example of Nazi order as </v>

1371
01:12:42.751 --> 01:12:43.584
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's at Nuremberg and I need to </v>

1372
01:12:44.581 --> 01:12:48.210
<v Speaker 2>explain this picture to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the Nuremberg field was massive.</v>

1373
01:12:48.211 --> 01:12:49.320
<v Speaker 2>As I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see those,</v>

1374
01:12:49.470 --> 01:12:50.303
<v Speaker 2>those curtains,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are lights and the lights are the </v>

1375
01:12:53.490 --> 01:12:57.510
<v Speaker 2>search lights from the lift Wafa which </v>
<v Speaker 2>was the Nazi air force.</v>

1376
01:12:57.511 --> 01:13:01.440
<v Speaker 2>And Hitler would put those up behind him</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he was speaking.</v>

1377
01:13:01.441 --> 01:13:02.274
<v Speaker 2>And so then he'd be have a curtain of </v>
<v Speaker 2>lights behind him that stretched up so </v>

1378
01:13:06.121 --> 01:13:08.280
<v Speaker 2>high into the sky that you couldn't see </v>
<v Speaker 2>the top of them.</v>

1379
01:13:08.670 --> 01:13:11.580
<v Speaker 2>And everybody was organized out there in</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're in their,</v>

1380
01:13:11.581 --> 01:13:13.350
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the marching field.</v>

1381
01:13:13.590 --> 01:13:16.650
<v Speaker 2>See there is a good example there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at those people on the left top,</v>

1382
01:13:16.651 --> 01:13:21.510
<v Speaker 2>left there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're organized in multiple dimensions</v>

1383
01:13:21.511 --> 01:13:22.344
<v Speaker 2>simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then on the right you see a </v>

1384
01:13:24.211 --> 01:13:25.044
<v Speaker 2>Nuremberg parade ground and there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of thousands of people there </v>

1385
01:13:28.051 --> 01:13:31.140
<v Speaker 2>and they're all in absolutely perfect </v>
<v Speaker 2>corridors.</v>

1386
01:13:34.820 --> 01:13:38.860
<v Speaker 2>These are comments from the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from Hitler and from the Nazis.</v>

1387
01:13:40.990 --> 01:13:41.823
<v Speaker 2>People,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world will recognize the Jew as </v>

1388
01:13:42.911 --> 01:13:43.744
<v Speaker 2>world parasite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there will be kind of a time when </v>

1389
01:13:45.341 --> 01:13:48.400
<v Speaker 2>there will be one united front of all </v>
<v Speaker 2>people against the Jewish world.</v>

1390
01:13:48.401 --> 01:13:49.234
<v Speaker 2>Parasite and humanity will be freed from</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most severe illness from which he </v>

1391
01:13:52.430 --> 01:13:55.210
<v Speaker 2>suffered for thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1392
01:13:55.211 --> 01:13:56.044
<v Speaker 2>and here's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's some quotes from Hitler from a </v>

1393
01:13:58.871 --> 01:14:01.480
<v Speaker 2>paper called Hitler's ideology embodied </v>
<v Speaker 2>metaphor,</v>

1394
01:14:01.481 --> 01:14:02.590
<v Speaker 2>fantasy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In history,</v>

1395
01:14:04.210 --> 01:14:08.110
<v Speaker 2>the state did not power possess the </v>
<v Speaker 2>power to manifest the disease.</v>

1396
01:14:08.111 --> 01:14:10.990
<v Speaker 2>The menacing decay of the right was </v>
<v Speaker 2>manifest.</v>

1397
01:14:13.060 --> 01:14:16.270
<v Speaker 2>Politicians tinkering around on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>German national body.</v>

1398
01:14:16.390 --> 01:14:18.760
<v Speaker 2>So most of the forms of our general </v>
<v Speaker 2>disease,</v>

1399
01:14:18.761 --> 01:14:22.630
<v Speaker 2>but blindly ignored the virus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At the time of the unification,</v>

1400
01:14:22.631 --> 01:14:23.464
<v Speaker 2>the inner decay was already in full </v>
<v Speaker 2>swing and the general situation was </v>

1401
01:14:26.531 --> 01:14:27.364
<v Speaker 2>deteriorating from year to year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The station did not grow inwardly </v>

1402
01:14:30.701 --> 01:14:33.400
<v Speaker 2>healthier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but obviously languished more and more.</v>

1403
01:14:33.730 --> 01:14:37.900
<v Speaker 2>The symptoms of decay of the prewar </v>
<v Speaker 2>period can be reduced to racial causes.</v>

1404
01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:42.580
<v Speaker 2>Anyone who wants to cure this era,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was inwardly sick and rotten,</v>

1405
01:14:42.790 --> 01:14:43.623
<v Speaker 2>must first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sum up the courage to make clear the </v>

1406
01:14:45.191 --> 01:14:46.024
<v Speaker 2>causes of this disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think that they must demonstrate </v>

1407
01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:50.193
<v Speaker 2>that they are ready for appeasement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so as to stay that deadly cancerous </v>

1408
01:14:52.751 --> 01:14:57.220
<v Speaker 2>ulcer through a policy of moderation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If this battle should not come,</v>

1409
01:14:57.221 --> 01:15:01.030
<v Speaker 2>Germany would decay and at best would </v>
<v Speaker 2>sync to ruin like a rotting corpse.</v>

1410
01:15:02.530 --> 01:15:03.760
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get the idea.</v>

1411
01:15:04.780 --> 01:15:05.613
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so interesting to me because you </v>

1412
01:15:07.501 --> 01:15:09.550
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is straight psychological research.</v>

1413
01:15:09.580 --> 01:15:11.080
<v Speaker 2>Most of it's psychometric,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1414
01:15:11.081 --> 01:15:11.914
<v Speaker 2>and all of a sudden out of that comes </v>
<v Speaker 2>this finding that orderliness is linked </v>

1415
01:15:14.201 --> 01:15:17.260
<v Speaker 2>to conservatism and it's linked to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavioral immune system.</v>

1416
01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:18.213
<v Speaker 2>And poof,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a completely new explanation </v>

1417
01:15:19.571 --> 01:15:22.900
<v Speaker 2>for what happened with the Nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1418
01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:28.060
<v Speaker 2>so that's what happens when orderliness </v>
<v Speaker 2>gets out of hand.</v>

1419
01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:29.223
<v Speaker 2>And it's interesting too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the Germans are known for their </v>

1420
01:15:30.851 --> 01:15:33.130
<v Speaker 2>orderliness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for their engineering prowess,</v>

1421
01:15:33.250 --> 01:15:36.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the organization and cleanliness and</v>

1422
01:15:36.790 --> 01:15:39.580
<v Speaker 2>freedom from corruption of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>political state.</v>

1423
01:15:40.090 --> 01:15:43.540
<v Speaker 2>And yet this is what happens when it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>taken to an extreme.</v>
