1
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.160
<v Speaker 1>You're here</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

2
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.800
<v Speaker 1>How do I know that I'm actually live?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey guys.</v>

3
00:01:13.801 --> 00:01:18.801
<v Speaker 1>Can you hear me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hi everyone.</v>

4
00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.510
<v Speaker 1>Good to see you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm a little tired side tonight.</v>

5
00:01:34.151 --> 00:01:38.260
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to start with a relatively </v>
<v Speaker 1>straightforward question.</v>

6
00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.863
<v Speaker 1>Somebody asked what's up with all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lenin pictures in your house and then </v>

7
00:01:45.581 --> 00:01:47.320
<v Speaker 1>how is it to look at them every day?</v>

8
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.000
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about</v>

9
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.133
<v Speaker 1>in 2001 in a fit of collective insanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I decided to start seeing if I could </v>

10
00:02:04.421 --> 00:02:08.560
<v Speaker 1>find Soviet era artifacts online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mostly through Ebay.</v>

11
00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:10.563
<v Speaker 1>I had read a paper by James Pennebaker </v>
<v Speaker 1>who claimed the past events start to </v>

12
00:02:15.341 --> 00:02:20.341
<v Speaker 1>become historically significant about 15</v>
<v Speaker 1>years after the after the relevant event</v>

13
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.360
<v Speaker 1>and so 2001 was 15 years after the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fault,</v>

14
00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.330
<v Speaker 1>essentially after the fall of the Berlin</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wall or close enough.</v>

15
00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.183
<v Speaker 1>And so I started looking on Ebay to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>what sort of Soviet artifacts or might </v>

16
00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.540
<v Speaker 1>be able to find.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

17
00:02:37.541 --> 00:02:38.374
<v Speaker 1>I was kind of curious about what would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be available for purchase and I also </v>

18
00:02:41.531 --> 00:02:45.480
<v Speaker 1>thought it was deeply ironic that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most free market of,</v>

19
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.810
<v Speaker 1>of what would you call platforms ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>devised,</v>

20
00:02:48.811 --> 00:02:53.811
<v Speaker 1>which would be Ebay could now be used to</v>
<v Speaker 1>scavenge communist era artists,</v>

21
00:02:54.581 --> 00:02:55.840
<v Speaker 1>Alex from Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

22
00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.550
<v Speaker 1>it just seemed like to be someone who </v>
<v Speaker 1>was during the Cold War,</v>

23
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:01.780
<v Speaker 1>the fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

24
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.973
<v Speaker 1>that I could buy things like heads of </v>
<v Speaker 1>linen on Ebay was just too comical to </v>

25
00:03:06.941 --> 00:03:08.380
<v Speaker 1>not to pass up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

26
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.203
<v Speaker 1>And so I started buying things that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>had some familiarity with because of </v>

27
00:03:13.631 --> 00:03:17.050
<v Speaker 1>what I'd read historically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the first thing I bought was about a</v>

28
00:03:17.051 --> 00:03:17.884
<v Speaker 1>three by five silk flag that was awarded</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a factory for meeting its five year </v>

29
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:23.523
<v Speaker 1>production quota.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know what you know about </v>

30
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.830
<v Speaker 1>those infamous quotas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what would happen is that there were</v>

31
00:03:29.831 --> 00:03:30.664
<v Speaker 1>addictive sent down on high about how </v>
<v Speaker 1>much factories were supposed to produce </v>

32
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.890
<v Speaker 1>and the implied,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

33
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.690
<v Speaker 1>what the implication was produced or </v>
<v Speaker 1>else by any means necessary.</v>

34
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.200
<v Speaker 1>And so two things happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three things happened.</v>

35
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.140
<v Speaker 1>The goods were often shawty because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were rushed,</v>

36
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.513
<v Speaker 1>there was deception about how much was </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually produced and then people were </v>

37
00:03:54.161 --> 00:03:58.990
<v Speaker 1>radically overworked and under supplied,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was a bad bad system,</v>

38
00:03:58.991 --> 00:03:59.824
<v Speaker 1>but it was very interesting to actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>have one of these flags and see what </v>

39
00:04:02.561 --> 00:04:06.070
<v Speaker 1>they were like and then I bought a </v>
<v Speaker 1>clock,</v>

40
00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:07.263
<v Speaker 1>a stainless steel clock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>windup clock that was a submarine clock </v>

41
00:04:10.091 --> 00:04:10.924
<v Speaker 1>and it was bomb proof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I thought that would be handy if </v>

42
00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.450
<v Speaker 1>someone ever bombed my house and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>needed to know what time it was.</v>

43
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:17.703
<v Speaker 1>So I bought that and then I found this </v>
<v Speaker 1>painting that's actually off to my left </v>

44
00:04:21.521 --> 00:04:25.420
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's five Russian revolutionaries,</v>

45
00:04:25.421 --> 00:04:26.254
<v Speaker 1>all young and quite stalwart looking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>standing on the edge of a cliff with a </v>

46
00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.090
<v Speaker 1>red soldier or a white soldier off to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the side.</v>

47
00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.820
<v Speaker 1>They're all shackled together and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>preparing to execute them.</v>

48
00:04:36.821 --> 00:04:37.654
<v Speaker 1>That was a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a fairly common Soviet motif </v>

49
00:04:42.281 --> 00:04:47.281
<v Speaker 1>and I'm on my right side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a and a decorated Soviet war hero</v>

50
00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.903
<v Speaker 1>who's working in a steel foundry and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of the Soviet or glorified I </v>

51
00:04:53.951 --> 00:04:57.550
<v Speaker 1>suppose the working class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I suppose there's nothing wrong with</v>

52
00:04:57.551 --> 00:04:58.384
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on the degree of </v>

53
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.810
<v Speaker 1>propagandistic content and </v>
<v Speaker 1>falsifications,</v>

54
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:02.663
<v Speaker 1>but</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're kind of like Norman Rockwell </v>

55
00:05:06.071 --> 00:05:06.904
<v Speaker 1>paintings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except they don't have the same degree </v>

56
00:05:08.201 --> 00:05:10.420
<v Speaker 1>of sentimentality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is quite interesting.</v>

57
00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.360
<v Speaker 1>And what's it like to have them around?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

58
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.943
<v Speaker 1>pretty much every square inch of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>house is covered with paintings and a </v>

59
00:05:17.291 --> 00:05:18.124
<v Speaker 1>fair number of them are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't suppose the sorts of paintings </v>

60
00:05:20.561 --> 00:05:22.270
<v Speaker 1>that people would usually have in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

61
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:23.103
<v Speaker 1>There was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them are of the Second World </v>

62
00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:25.173
<v Speaker 1>War.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them are strongly political and </v>

63
00:05:28.691 --> 00:05:30.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

64
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.500
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well sometimes people say,</v>

65
00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.870
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't want to live in a museum.</v>

66
00:05:37.871 --> 00:05:42.700
<v Speaker 1>And I guess that isn't how I feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually like living in the museum.</v>

67
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.890
<v Speaker 1>And I liked having these historical </v>
<v Speaker 1>artifacts,</v>

68
00:05:44.891 --> 00:05:49.891
<v Speaker 1>so around and I really liked watching </v>
<v Speaker 1>the propaganda and the art more in the,</v>

69
00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:51.213
<v Speaker 1>in the paintings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because many of these paintings were </v>

70
00:05:53.381 --> 00:05:56.980
<v Speaker 1>produced by very talented impressionist </v>
<v Speaker 1>artists who were trained.</v>

71
00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.620
<v Speaker 1>The classical European tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They spent months making these paintings</v>

72
00:06:00.621 --> 00:06:05.240
<v Speaker 1>and yet their subordinate in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a political ideology.</v>

73
00:06:05.241 --> 00:06:06.074
<v Speaker 1>But what's interesting is that as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>political ideology recedes into the </v>

74
00:06:09.861 --> 00:06:13.850
<v Speaker 1>past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more purely artistic elements of the</v>

75
00:06:13.851 --> 00:06:14.684
<v Speaker 1>paintings seem to remain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's cool to kind of watch it's </v>

76
00:06:18.531 --> 00:06:19.364
<v Speaker 1>very slow process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's very interesting to watch the </v>

77
00:06:22.071 --> 00:06:26.840
<v Speaker 1>art itself emerged triumphant over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>propaganda and then,</v>

78
00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these things also reminded me of,</v>

79
00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:29.883
<v Speaker 1>of what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm interested in and that's the </v>

80
00:06:33.741 --> 00:06:34.574
<v Speaker 1>study of videology and they reminded me </v>
<v Speaker 1>how powerful ideology can be and how </v>

81
00:06:38.991 --> 00:06:42.530
<v Speaker 1>many different pathways that can take </v>
<v Speaker 1>two to,</v>

82
00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:44.480
<v Speaker 1>to control I suppose it.</v>

83
00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.750
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it also reminds me of the reality of</v>

84
00:06:47.751 --> 00:06:51.010
<v Speaker 1>the 20th century because it was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible reality.</v>

85
00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:54.440
<v Speaker 1>And if we forget it then we weren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>likely to repeat it.</v>

86
00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:56.443
<v Speaker 1>Now my kids grew up in this house and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>asked them about it because I suppose </v>

87
00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:04.910
<v Speaker 1>the paintings are fairly heavy and maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>even somewhat frightening,</v>

88
00:07:04.911 --> 00:07:08.760
<v Speaker 1>but they really liked it and the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I.</v>

89
00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:09.673
<v Speaker 1>It gives me a reason to invite people </v>
<v Speaker 1>into my house and gives me something to </v>

90
00:07:12.621 --> 00:07:13.454
<v Speaker 1>play with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

91
00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:14.463
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I need things to play with by </v>

92
00:07:18.231 --> 00:07:22.430
<v Speaker 1>all appearances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the story of the,</v>

93
00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.940
<v Speaker 1>of the Soviet paintings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

94
00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:36.253
<v Speaker 1>please tell us about your ideas of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem of gender integrated combat </v>

95
00:07:39.321 --> 00:07:40.154
<v Speaker 1>units and how it affects morale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Please talk about the role trans people </v>

96
00:07:43.971 --> 00:07:46.280
<v Speaker 1>should or should not serve in combat </v>
<v Speaker 1>units.</v>

97
00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:48.620
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

98
00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:50.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say that I'm</v>

99
00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:55.110
<v Speaker 1>exactly an expert in that regard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

100
00:07:57.230 --> 00:08:02.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how gender</v>
<v Speaker 1>power,</v>

101
00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:02.963
<v Speaker 1>multiple gender combat units are going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to work my because I'm fundamentally a </v>

102
00:08:07.011 --> 00:08:07.844
<v Speaker 1>traditionalist in most ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mostly because I'm afraid of the </v>

103
00:08:11.271 --> 00:08:13.790
<v Speaker 1>unintended consequences of radical </v>
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>

104
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:15.223
<v Speaker 1>I would say that it's dangerous to </v>
<v Speaker 1>adjust a system that's working and it's </v>

105
00:08:18.801 --> 00:08:19.634
<v Speaker 1>very hard for me to imagine a situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in a combat situation where </v>

106
00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:29.180
<v Speaker 1>the women and men can actually be </v>
<v Speaker 1>treated equally.</v>

107
00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:32.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that the broader society </v>
<v Speaker 1>would even want to see that.</v>

108
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:35.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean I suppose there are exceptions to</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of thing.</v>

109
00:08:35.781 --> 00:08:36.614
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

110
00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:39.860
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the situation perhaps in Israel,</v>

111
00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:44.360
<v Speaker 1>although I suspect even in Israel that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the women take the more,</v>

112
00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:49.010
<v Speaker 1>the less combat heavy jobs now I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know that but,</v>

113
00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:51.980
<v Speaker 1>and maybe I'm just being prejudiced in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that answer,</v>

114
00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:52.843
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

115
00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:00.700
<v Speaker 1>it just doesn't seem to me to be a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>wise idea.</v>

116
00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:03.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what role trans people should serve.</v>

117
00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:06.550
<v Speaker 1>I really can't say I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have anything,</v>

118
00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:09.130
<v Speaker 1>any advice about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just not</v>

119
00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:15.910
<v Speaker 1>informed enough to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>a conclusion about that.</v>

120
00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.430
<v Speaker 1>I think it's very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

121
00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:20.043
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to some people in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Canadian armed forces in recent months </v>

122
00:09:23.141 --> 00:09:23.974
<v Speaker 1>and I do think it's very strange that </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the sort of problem that our </v>

123
00:09:28.151 --> 00:09:30.320
<v Speaker 1>military is actually trying to solve </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

124
00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:31.653
<v Speaker 1>You'd think that there would be more </v>
<v Speaker 1>important things to concentrate on then </v>

125
00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.440
<v Speaker 1>rapid gender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

126
00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:38.733
<v Speaker 1>equalization in the military.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't see why that's such a </v>

127
00:09:42.791 --> 00:09:43.624
<v Speaker 1>priority,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe that's just my old fashioned </v>

128
00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:49.660
<v Speaker 1>conservatism speaking it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be,</v>

129
00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:52.423
<v Speaker 1>it could be that I'm derek fake asks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you see love arrows in your </v>

130
00:09:57.941 --> 00:10:00.970
<v Speaker 1>general world view?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where does love come from?</v>

131
00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:02.710
<v Speaker 1>You guys?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

132
00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:05.590
<v Speaker 1>Asking possibly hard questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

133
00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:11.400
<v Speaker 1>I think that truth has to be embodied </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside love or in embedded inside love.</v>

134
00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:12.663
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not easy to figure out a hierarchy </v>

135
00:10:15.161 --> 00:10:16.870
<v Speaker 1>of values,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of ultimate values.</v>

136
00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:22.180
<v Speaker 1>There's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The great traditional values of the good</v>

137
00:10:22.181 --> 00:10:25.390
<v Speaker 1>and the beautiful and the true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

138
00:10:25.391 --> 00:10:26.224
<v Speaker 1>to courageous and that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not easy to figure out how you </v>

139
00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:31.533
<v Speaker 1>arrange those hierarchically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seems to me that truth is likely </v>

140
00:10:36.461 --> 00:10:37.294
<v Speaker 1>something that serves a master of one </v>
<v Speaker 1>form or another at least ethical truth </v>

141
00:10:41.291 --> 00:10:46.291
<v Speaker 1>and love is something like the decision </v>
<v Speaker 1>that being is fundamentally good or it's</v>

142
00:10:47.651 --> 00:10:50.440
<v Speaker 1>the decision to act as if being as </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally good.</v>

143
00:10:50.441 --> 00:10:52.450
<v Speaker 1>That might be the right way of thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

144
00:10:52.451 --> 00:10:53.284
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought about this in relationship to </v>

145
00:10:55.931 --> 00:10:59.830
<v Speaker 1>my son when he was little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three years old and like unbearably cute</v>

146
00:10:59.831 --> 00:11:03.160
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little three year olds,</v>

147
00:11:03.161 --> 00:11:05.020
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're fairly easily hurt.</v>

148
00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:06.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're quite robust in some ways,</v>

149
00:11:06.731 --> 00:11:07.564
<v Speaker 1>but they're fairly easily hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can run out into traffic and you </v>

150
00:11:10.481 --> 00:11:11.314
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they skinned their knees and they bang </v>

151
00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:15.190
<v Speaker 1>heads on table sued,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

152
00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:16.093
<v Speaker 1>they're prone to emotional breakdown and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have all these extreme fragilities </v>

153
00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:26.650
<v Speaker 1>that make you nervous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

154
00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:27.753
<v Speaker 1>and alert and attended as an adult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that also expose you directly to </v>

155
00:11:32.471 --> 00:11:33.304
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the fact of the potential tragedy of </v>

156
00:11:35.351 --> 00:11:36.184
<v Speaker 1>life coaches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the reasons why having </v>

157
00:11:38.201 --> 00:11:41.740
<v Speaker 1>children matures you in a way that </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing else can.</v>

158
00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:43.780
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I imagined,</v>

159
00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:46.780
<v Speaker 1>I've written about this in my new book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>12 rules for life.</v>

160
00:11:46.781 --> 00:11:47.614
<v Speaker 1>I imagined that I could remove his </v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerabilities one by one so that he </v>

161
00:11:52.091 --> 00:11:53.410
<v Speaker 1>couldn't be hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

162
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:54.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

163
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:55.863
<v Speaker 1>well I could make them into a robot and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was 15 feet tall and made out of </v>

164
00:12:00.611 --> 00:12:04.530
<v Speaker 1>metal and that would remove his physical</v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability,</v>

165
00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:07.100
<v Speaker 1>can have tremendous strength and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

166
00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:11.410
<v Speaker 1>you could turn them into something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>a superhero with all these,</v>

167
00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:16.450
<v Speaker 1>with all these strengths instead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these exceptional vulnerabilities.</v>

168
00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:17.283
<v Speaker 1>But what I realized very rapidly was </v>
<v Speaker 1>that every time he removed a </v>

169
00:12:20.711 --> 00:12:21.544
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you removed an essential part of the </v>

170
00:12:24.101 --> 00:12:24.791
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

171
00:12:24.791 --> 00:12:25.624
<v Speaker 1>a part that you really love because with</v>
<v Speaker 1>that little three year old boy kid for </v>

172
00:12:29.051 --> 00:12:32.050
<v Speaker 1>example mean it's there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's there,</v>

173
00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:33.753
<v Speaker 1>it's there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fragility in some sense that's a huge </v>

174
00:12:35.921 --> 00:12:39.070
<v Speaker 1>part of their charm and appeal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like you'd wish it on them,</v>

175
00:12:39.071 --> 00:12:43.630
<v Speaker 1>but it's part of their.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's part of their value as beings and I</v>

176
00:12:43.631 --> 00:12:44.464
<v Speaker 1>think that reflects something like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>paradoxical situation that the Dallas </v>

177
00:12:49.121 --> 00:12:54.121
<v Speaker 1>referred to when when they in the Tao Te</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ching and they talk about the what makes</v>

178
00:12:54.401 --> 00:12:57.280
<v Speaker 1>a plot valuable is the empty space </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside it.</v>

179
00:12:57.281 --> 00:13:00.670
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's what it's not as much as what it is</v>

180
00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:01.743
<v Speaker 1>that makes it well actual first of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>real but also useful and there's </v>

181
00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:10.270
<v Speaker 1>something really profound about that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that limitations.</v>

182
00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:14.530
<v Speaker 1>So I would say limitation is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>precondition for being.</v>

183
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:16.263
<v Speaker 1>And it's really I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to get this right so that you </v>

184
00:13:18.821 --> 00:13:19.654
<v Speaker 1>can follow it because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the most useful thoughts I </v>

185
00:13:22.001 --> 00:13:25.180
<v Speaker 1>think that has ever occurred to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first is the</v>

186
00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:31.000
<v Speaker 1>limits are a precondition for being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like rules are preconditioned for a</v>

187
00:13:31.001 --> 00:13:33.910
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't play a game where you can</v>

188
00:13:33.911 --> 00:13:34.744
<v Speaker 1>make any move at any time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to narrow the playing field </v>

189
00:13:37.611 --> 00:13:38.444
<v Speaker 1>substantially and you have to put </v>
<v Speaker 1>restrictions on what can be done in </v>

190
00:13:41.981 --> 00:13:42.814
<v Speaker 1>order for anything to be done and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe being is this paradoxical state </v>

191
00:13:46.781 --> 00:13:51.781
<v Speaker 1>where there's there's just enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>limitation to maximize possibility,</v>

192
00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:56.650
<v Speaker 1>something like that and that seems right</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me why that would be.</v>

193
00:13:56.651 --> 00:13:57.484
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe that's something like an </v>

194
00:13:58.751 --> 00:14:01.570
<v Speaker 1>answer to why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why there's anything,</v>

195
00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:02.543
<v Speaker 1>why anything was created or I know I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking metaphysically but but I still </v>

196
00:14:07.571 --> 00:14:10.540
<v Speaker 1>think it's worthwhile doing so and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

197
00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:12.940
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

198
00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:14.163
<v Speaker 1>if limitation is the precondition for </v>
<v Speaker 1>being then then that that introduces </v>

199
00:14:18.361 --> 00:14:19.194
<v Speaker 1>suffering into the world and tragedy </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of course suffering and tragedy </v>

200
00:14:22.121 --> 00:14:22.954
<v Speaker 1>or consequence of limitation and so then</v>
<v Speaker 1>the situation is that if you want to </v>

201
00:14:27.041 --> 00:14:30.400
<v Speaker 1>have the being where possibility is </v>
<v Speaker 1>maximized,</v>

202
00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:35.730
<v Speaker 1>you have to accept the limitations that </v>
<v Speaker 1>produced tragedy and so that's maybe the</v>

203
00:14:35.741 --> 00:14:37.330
<v Speaker 1>justification for tragedy.</v>

204
00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:39.730
<v Speaker 1>Assuming that such a thing needs to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>justified.</v>

205
00:14:39.731 --> 00:14:44.731
<v Speaker 1>And then the final thought in that three</v>
<v Speaker 1>part series as well.</v>

206
00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:46.083
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's a way to live so that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tragedy that's an intrinsic part of </v>

207
00:14:49.721 --> 00:14:50.554
<v Speaker 1>limited being becomes bearable or </v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes even something like celebrate </v>

208
00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:55.333
<v Speaker 1>and I guess that would be akin to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nietzsche's wish for the eternal return </v>

209
00:14:59.421 --> 00:15:00.254
<v Speaker 1>like he thought you should live so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>if every moment that you lived recurred </v>

210
00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:05.870
<v Speaker 1>eternally that that would be a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

211
00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:11.120
<v Speaker 1>and so it's a heroic motive being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's conceivable that are heroic mode of</v>

212
00:15:11.121 --> 00:15:14.360
<v Speaker 1>being that requires the adoption of </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility,</v>

213
00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:15.513
<v Speaker 1>gives your life sufficient gravitas and </v>
<v Speaker 1>weight and meaning so that the tragedy </v>

214
00:15:19.671 --> 00:15:23.810
<v Speaker 1>of being can be withstood without </v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming corrupt,</v>

215
00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:26.990
<v Speaker 1>and I would certainly hope that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be the case.</v>

216
00:15:26.991 --> 00:15:29.960
<v Speaker 1>And I think there's some reasons to </v>
<v Speaker 1>assume that it might be.</v>

217
00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:31.363
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you talk more about the </v>

218
00:15:37.101 --> 00:15:37.934
<v Speaker 1>resurrection?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This remains a stumbling block for many </v>

219
00:15:40.551 --> 00:15:43.940
<v Speaker 1>of your more atheistic followers who </v>
<v Speaker 1>have otherwise embraced your approach to</v>

220
00:15:43.941 --> 00:15:46.940
<v Speaker 1>understanding Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>

221
00:15:46.941 --> 00:15:50.330
<v Speaker 1>I can only talk about it symbolically to</v>
<v Speaker 1>begin with and that's,</v>

222
00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:52.730
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not sufficient,</v>

223
00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:54.223
<v Speaker 1>but I hope as I moved through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Biblical series that I can zero in on </v>

224
00:15:58.221 --> 00:16:00.270
<v Speaker 1>that more and more particularly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

225
00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:05.140
<v Speaker 3>the idea of the dying and resurrected </v>
<v Speaker 3>God is a very old idea.</v>

226
00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:06.713
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's echoed in such things as the </v>

227
00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:12.400
<v Speaker 3>imagery save the Phoenix which burns </v>
<v Speaker 3>itself up.</v>

228
00:16:12.401 --> 00:16:16.270
<v Speaker 3>And then Ms Dot Torres itself to its,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to its early form.</v>

229
00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:20.740
<v Speaker 3>And I think speaking purely </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychologically,</v>

230
00:16:20.741 --> 00:16:25.741
<v Speaker 3>that idea of the dying and resurrected </v>
<v Speaker 3>savior is something like a reflection of</v>

231
00:16:26.111 --> 00:16:30.310
<v Speaker 3>the fact that in order to progress </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychologically,</v>

232
00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:33.910
<v Speaker 3>you have to let go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially in the face of obstacles.</v>

233
00:16:33.911 --> 00:16:38.110
<v Speaker 3>You have to let go of those things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are impeding your progress that might be</v>

234
00:16:38.111 --> 00:16:38.944
<v Speaker 3>very dear to your heart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to let them go and let them </v>

235
00:16:41.231 --> 00:16:42.064
<v Speaker 3>die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you have to let a new part of </v>

236
00:16:43.151 --> 00:16:46.720
<v Speaker 3>yourself be born.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So because when you're wrong,</v>

237
00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:49.120
<v Speaker 3>you have to let the part of you that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong,</v>

238
00:16:49.121 --> 00:16:52.120
<v Speaker 3>die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then a new part spring to life.</v>

239
00:16:52.121 --> 00:16:53.010
<v Speaker 3>In some sense.</v>

240
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:54.263
<v Speaker 3>It's a new part that's partly a union of</v>
<v Speaker 3>your mind and union of the information </v>

241
00:16:58.391 --> 00:16:59.224
<v Speaker 3>that's contained in the error that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>committed and it's like the birth in </v>

242
00:17:02.411 --> 00:17:03.244
<v Speaker 3>some sense of the new spirit and so you </v>
<v Speaker 3>could say that there's this idea that </v>

243
00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:09.603
<v Speaker 3>you have to have faith in Christ because</v>
<v Speaker 3>Christ is the way and the truth and the </v>

244
00:17:12.551 --> 00:17:15.190
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one comes to the father but through,</v>

245
00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:18.670
<v Speaker 3>but through him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What that means symbolically as far as I</v>

246
00:17:18.671 --> 00:17:19.504
<v Speaker 3>can tell that is that you have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>embrace the process of voluntary death </v>

247
00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:28.260
<v Speaker 3>and rebirth in order to continue moving </v>
<v Speaker 3>forward properly in your life and it.</v>

248
00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:29.373
<v Speaker 3>It's also that process of death and </v>
<v Speaker 3>rebirth that rejuvenates the father and </v>

249
00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:33.843
<v Speaker 3>it's also that process of death and </v>
<v Speaker 3>rebirth that produces the father to </v>

250
00:17:36.761 --> 00:17:37.594
<v Speaker 3>begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you think about the father is the </v>

251
00:17:38.921 --> 00:17:39.754
<v Speaker 3>symbol of of culture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so at minimum the idea of the </v>

252
00:17:44.681 --> 00:17:45.514
<v Speaker 3>resurrected Christ is the idea that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>should identify not with that part of </v>

253
00:17:49.741 --> 00:17:54.420
<v Speaker 3>yourself that stagnant and dead and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>already knows but is prone to error.</v>

254
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:58.890
<v Speaker 3>You should identify with that part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself that's always stretching beyond</v>

255
00:17:58.891 --> 00:17:59.724
<v Speaker 3>what you currently know and has the </v>
<v Speaker 3>faith to let go of old certainties so </v>

256
00:18:03.781 --> 00:18:07.560
<v Speaker 3>that new patterns of being can be </v>
<v Speaker 3>brought into place.</v>

257
00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:08.993
<v Speaker 3>And so now that's a purely psychological</v>
<v Speaker 3>explanation and I think I made the case </v>

258
00:18:15.421 --> 00:18:16.254
<v Speaker 3>in my biblical lectures that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>striving for a psychological </v>

259
00:18:18.481 --> 00:18:20.640
<v Speaker 3>interpretation at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

260
00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:21.863
<v Speaker 3>my experience with the biblical stories </v>
<v Speaker 3>is that there are layers of depth in </v>

261
00:18:26.971 --> 00:18:27.804
<v Speaker 3>them that are sufficiently profound </v>
<v Speaker 3>perhaps because of the staggering </v>

262
00:18:32.791 --> 00:18:33.624
<v Speaker 3>hyperlinking of the text and its </v>
<v Speaker 3>association with almost the entire </v>

263
00:18:36.871 --> 00:18:41.280
<v Speaker 3>Corpus of Western literature that as you</v>
<v Speaker 3>keep digging,</v>

264
00:18:41.281 --> 00:18:43.050
<v Speaker 3>you find more and more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

265
00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:44.433
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what to make of the more </v>

266
00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:48.760
<v Speaker 3>metaphysical claims,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

267
00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:50.213
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm going to leave it at that </v>

268
00:18:51.301 --> 00:18:53.370
<v Speaker 3>because I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's only speculation.</v>

269
00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:57.810
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see,</v>

270
00:18:57.870 --> 00:18:58.703
<v Speaker 3>I guess it is that we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really don't believe that we </v>

271
00:19:00.661 --> 00:19:05.661
<v Speaker 3>understand consciousness and we don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand its role in the cosmos.</v>

272
00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:07.133
<v Speaker 3>It could be that consciousness is just </v>
<v Speaker 3>an epiphenomenon of materialist </v>

273
00:19:09.871 --> 00:19:10.704
<v Speaker 3>processes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a couple of things to me </v>

274
00:19:13.531 --> 00:19:15.940
<v Speaker 3>that seems to mitigate against that </v>
<v Speaker 3>explanation,</v>

275
00:19:15.941 --> 00:19:16.774
<v Speaker 3>and the first is that we don't have an </v>
<v Speaker 3>account of consciousness that's that's </v>

276
00:19:21.631 --> 00:19:22.464
<v Speaker 3>useful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have no idea how the material </v>

277
00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:24.953
<v Speaker 3>substrate of the brain produces this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This awareness and self awareness that </v>

278
00:19:29.281 --> 00:19:34.281
<v Speaker 3>seems to be crucially important in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>existence of the cosmos and so far as if</v>

279
00:19:34.981 --> 00:19:36.840
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing to experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

280
00:19:36.841 --> 00:19:39.960
<v Speaker 3>It's very difficult to say in what way </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it exists.</v>

281
00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:41.303
<v Speaker 3>You need a viewer and an observer and </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientists sort of gerrymandered out by </v>

282
00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:46.013
<v Speaker 3>positing a hypothetical observer when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they talk about a phenomena where there </v>

283
00:19:49.831 --> 00:19:50.664
<v Speaker 3>is no actual observer and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness could be just an EPA </v>

284
00:19:54.261 --> 00:19:55.094
<v Speaker 3>phenomena,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it could also be something central </v>

285
00:19:56.671 --> 00:19:57.504
<v Speaker 3>to the nature of being and certainly </v>
<v Speaker 3>mythological stories presented that way </v>

286
00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:02.130
<v Speaker 3>that there's.</v>

287
00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:02.963
<v Speaker 3>There's nature now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would be nurtured from a scientific </v>

288
00:20:05.011 --> 00:20:05.844
<v Speaker 3>perspective and there's the social world</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be the great father from the </v>

289
00:20:08.671 --> 00:20:09.504
<v Speaker 3>mythological perspective and and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>all there is from a scientific </v>

290
00:20:13.111 --> 00:20:15.630
<v Speaker 3>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but from a mythological perspective,</v>

291
00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:16.493
<v Speaker 3>there's active consciousness and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>associated with the idea of the logos </v>

292
00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:24.930
<v Speaker 3>and the logos seems to be something like</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you think about it as consciousness,</v>

293
00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:29.640
<v Speaker 3>it seems to be this thing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>encounters the potential of future being</v>

294
00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:32.880
<v Speaker 3>and then determines at least in part how</v>
<v Speaker 3>to shape it.</v>

295
00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:35.910
<v Speaker 3>Obviously we're constrained in many </v>
<v Speaker 3>ways.</v>

296
00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:36.953
<v Speaker 3>We can't shape things in any old way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we can certainly advance in the </v>

297
00:20:41.671 --> 00:20:45.690
<v Speaker 3>direction of our imagination and quite </v>
<v Speaker 3>staggering and compelling manner.</v>

298
00:20:45.691 --> 00:20:48.880
<v Speaker 3>And then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that real?</v>

299
00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:54.260
<v Speaker 3>Is is is the idea that we have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness and that it's free in some</v>

300
00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:59.880
<v Speaker 3>in in incomprehensible sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that it plays a role in constructing</v>

301
00:21:00.101 --> 00:21:00.940
<v Speaker 3>the cosmos?</v>

302
00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:03.700
<v Speaker 3>Is that real?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I would say,</v>

303
00:21:03.701 --> 00:21:05.470
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it depends on what you mean by real,</v>

304
00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:10.540
<v Speaker 3>but I would also point out that you act </v>
<v Speaker 3>as if it's real and that are functional.</v>

305
00:21:10.541 --> 00:21:11.374
<v Speaker 3>Legal systems like the legal systems of </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the West are predicated on the </v>

306
00:21:15.071 --> 00:21:18.430
<v Speaker 3>acceptance of its reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was an idea that took many,</v>

307
00:21:18.431 --> 00:21:22.420
<v Speaker 3>many thousands of years to be merge </v>
<v Speaker 3>know.</v>

308
00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:25.840
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only sovereign was well was the king</v>

309
00:21:25.841 --> 00:21:28.510
<v Speaker 3>and God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the nobles became sovereign and</v>

310
00:21:28.511 --> 00:21:32.080
<v Speaker 3>then men became sovereign.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then with the Christian revolution,</v>

311
00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:34.820
<v Speaker 3>every individual's soul became </v>
<v Speaker 3>sovereign.</v>

312
00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:36.063
<v Speaker 3>That idea of of individual sovereignty </v>
<v Speaker 3>and worth is the core presupposition of </v>

313
00:21:40.031 --> 00:21:42.130
<v Speaker 3>our legal system and our cultural </v>
<v Speaker 3>systems.</v>

314
00:21:42.131 --> 00:21:42.964
<v Speaker 3>And so we all walk around acting as if </v>
<v Speaker 3>every one of us is a divine center of </v>

315
00:21:48.551 --> 00:21:53.060
<v Speaker 3>logos because we give each other the </v>
<v Speaker 3>respect of,</v>

316
00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:57.070
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of individual citizens who are sovereign</v>

317
00:21:57.580 --> 00:21:59.260
<v Speaker 3>and that are equal before the law.</v>

318
00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:02.740
<v Speaker 3>And the funny thing is is if someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't treat you that way,</v>

319
00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:07.790
<v Speaker 3>he treats you as if you're free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Will is an illusion or refuses to regard</v>

320
00:22:08.861 --> 00:22:13.861
<v Speaker 3>you as someone who plays a active part </v>
<v Speaker 3>in choosing outcome of their life.</v>

321
00:22:14.321 --> 00:22:15.880
<v Speaker 3>Then you get very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very annoyed.</v>

322
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:19.780
<v Speaker 3>And so if it's an illusion and perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 3>it is,</v>

323
00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:24.070
<v Speaker 3>we don't understand an alternative to it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's unbelievably,</v>

324
00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:29.230
<v Speaker 3>it's unbelievably functional.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So okay,</v>

325
00:22:29.231 --> 00:22:31.210
<v Speaker 3>so back to love.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

326
00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:32.773
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will make the case that a limitation is </v>

327
00:22:38.351 --> 00:22:39.184
<v Speaker 3>necessary for being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we can make the case that </v>

328
00:22:42.071 --> 00:22:46.480
<v Speaker 3>tragedy is an inevitable consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 3>limitation.</v>

329
00:22:46.481 --> 00:22:47.590
<v Speaker 3>And then we might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

330
00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:48.433
<v Speaker 3>is being worth the tragedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think the answer yes to that is </v>

331
00:22:53.771 --> 00:22:54.604
<v Speaker 3>love.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the answer no to that is the </v>

332
00:22:56.321 --> 00:23:00.310
<v Speaker 3>opposite of love because when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you love someone,</v>

333
00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:04.810
<v Speaker 3>you love them in spite of or even </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of their vulnerability,</v>

334
00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:07.540
<v Speaker 3>not that you don't want them to </v>
<v Speaker 3>transcend that because you do.</v>

335
00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:08.913
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think that love is the acceptance </v>

336
00:23:12.941 --> 00:23:13.774
<v Speaker 3>of the price of being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the way you manifest your </v>

337
00:23:16.211 --> 00:23:18.910
<v Speaker 3>acceptance of the price of being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because if you love someone,</v>

338
00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:20.163
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have their vulnerabilities like </v>

339
00:23:21.461 --> 00:23:22.294
<v Speaker 3>every human being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but your basic judgment is that despite </v>

340
00:23:27.041 --> 00:23:27.874
<v Speaker 3>the fact that they have these </v>
<v Speaker 3>vulnerabilities that are even fatal and </v>

341
00:23:31.211 --> 00:23:32.044
<v Speaker 3>that are certainly tragic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's better that they were then </v>

342
00:23:35.211 --> 00:23:37.750
<v Speaker 3>that they weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's,</v>

343
00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:42.040
<v Speaker 3>and I think that's the right attitude to</v>
<v Speaker 3>have towards being itself.</v>

344
00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:43.240
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

345
00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:46.490
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an optimistic attitude</v>

346
00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:51.500
<v Speaker 1>and I think it has to be predicated on </v>
<v Speaker 1>faith because I don't think that you can</v>

347
00:23:51.501 --> 00:23:56.290
<v Speaker 1>necessarily derive that conclusion by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by looking at the available evidence.</v>

348
00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:00.020
<v Speaker 1>The evidence is kind of 50 slash 50 and </v>
<v Speaker 1>in many situations,</v>

349
00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:01.493
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can tell you if you adopt the </v>

350
00:24:03.891 --> 00:24:07.100
<v Speaker 1>other attitude that being is </v>
<v Speaker 1>unjustifiable,</v>

351
00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:11.180
<v Speaker 1>then that leads you down a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very dark road and then you assume start</v>

352
00:24:11.181 --> 00:24:15.710
<v Speaker 1>to work in a way that makes things far </v>
<v Speaker 1>more intolerable then they should be.</v>

353
00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:18.590
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

354
00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:23.960
<v Speaker 1>that's my answer to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any tips on avoiding booze?</v>

355
00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:26.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a real tough one.</v>

356
00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:28.070
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say a couple of things.</v>

357
00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:30.770
<v Speaker 1>There is a drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a binge drinker,</v>

358
00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:32.203
<v Speaker 1>there is a drug called naltrexone that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could consider and you take mail </v>

359
00:24:35.331 --> 00:24:38.480
<v Speaker 1>trucks on every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't really have any psychological</v>

360
00:24:38.481 --> 00:24:41.900
<v Speaker 1>effect on you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you're a naltrexone responder,</v>

361
00:24:41.901 --> 00:24:46.040
<v Speaker 1>what'll happen is that it will dampen </v>
<v Speaker 1>your positive response to alcohol.</v>

362
00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:46.873
<v Speaker 1>So some people who are alcoholic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of them have a very pronounced </v>

363
00:24:50.061 --> 00:24:51.770
<v Speaker 1>opiate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a,</v>

364
00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:55.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an opiate effect from alcohol.</v>

365
00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:56.203
<v Speaker 1>It looks like it's mediated by Beta </v>
<v Speaker 1>endorphin and now trick zone into is an </v>

366
00:24:59.511 --> 00:25:00.950
<v Speaker 1>opiate blocker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

367
00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:02.403
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what naltrexone seems to do is dampen </v>

368
00:25:05.241 --> 00:25:08.690
<v Speaker 1>the positive response and the positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>response,</v>

369
00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:09.733
<v Speaker 1>which would be opiate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then dopaminergic is the same </v>

370
00:25:13.161 --> 00:25:16.220
<v Speaker 1>response that makes you want to keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>drinking when you start drinking.</v>

371
00:25:16.221 --> 00:25:19.040
<v Speaker 1>So if you're one of those people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>has a drink and then has to have another</v>

372
00:25:19.041 --> 00:25:21.080
<v Speaker 1>one and then has to have another one and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

373
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:21.943
<v Speaker 1>soon all your money's gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the probability that you have an </v>

374
00:25:24.561 --> 00:25:25.394
<v Speaker 1>opiate response is pretty high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now trick someone can help with </v>

375
00:25:28.221 --> 00:25:29.054
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

376
00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:32.540
<v Speaker 1>generally when people take naltrexone </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they keep drinking,</v>

377
00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:34.580
<v Speaker 1>they try to control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they keep drinking.</v>

378
00:25:34.581 --> 00:25:38.630
<v Speaker 1>And they learn over time that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol doesn't have the same punch.</v>

379
00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:39.493
<v Speaker 1>It's still pleasant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't have the same </v>

380
00:25:40.311 --> 00:25:42.740
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming punch that it did at one </v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

381
00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:46.490
<v Speaker 1>So that would be one suggestion and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>worth trying.</v>

382
00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:48.043
<v Speaker 1>The other is like make a plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say do the future authoring </v>

383
00:25:50.781 --> 00:25:54.260
<v Speaker 1>program because it isn't that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to avoid booze.</v>

384
00:25:54.261 --> 00:25:55.094
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that you're trying to restructure </v>

385
00:25:57.051 --> 00:25:58.280
<v Speaker 1>your whole life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

386
00:25:58.310 --> 00:26:01.730
<v Speaker 1>because if you're a drinker then all </v>
<v Speaker 1>your friends are drinkers and,</v>

387
00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:06.560
<v Speaker 1>and you're used to drinking in every </v>
<v Speaker 1>social situation and the places that you</v>

388
00:26:06.561 --> 00:26:10.790
<v Speaker 1>go to socialize or places that you drink</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like it's really built in as a whole</v>

389
00:26:10.791 --> 00:26:11.624
<v Speaker 1>set of habits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what you have to do is kind of </v>

390
00:26:14.181 --> 00:26:16.610
<v Speaker 1>redesign your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you have to think of things.</v>

391
00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:21.380
<v Speaker 1>You can't just stop drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to figure out what you're going</v>

392
00:26:21.381 --> 00:26:25.370
<v Speaker 1>to start doing instead of drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a hole that you have to fill in.</v>

393
00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:26.653
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the future authoring program will also </v>

394
00:26:28.521 --> 00:26:32.210
<v Speaker 1>help you figure out what your life could</v>
<v Speaker 1>look like in the absence of alcohol.</v>

395
00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:34.003
<v Speaker 1>And what kind of hell you could end up </v>
<v Speaker 1>in if you keep drinking and it causes </v>

396
00:26:38.421 --> 00:26:42.200
<v Speaker 1>all the problems that it can cause and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think you really need to like,</v>

397
00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:43.093
<v Speaker 1>you need to think the hail that can </v>
<v Speaker 1>occur and you have to think through how </v>

398
00:26:46.771 --> 00:26:47.604
<v Speaker 1>your life could be valuable with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol so that you can be motivated </v>

399
00:26:51.121 --> 00:26:54.720
<v Speaker 1>enough to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to try to regulate it.</v>

400
00:26:54.721 --> 00:26:57.810
<v Speaker 1>And I would also say if you failed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>slip,</v>

401
00:26:58.290 --> 00:27:00.720
<v Speaker 1>don't berate yourself and beat yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

402
00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:03.920
<v Speaker 1>Just start quitting again because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

403
00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:07.050
<v Speaker 1>if you could cut your alcohol intake </v>
<v Speaker 1>down 75 percent,</v>

404
00:27:07.051 --> 00:27:07.884
<v Speaker 1>that's a hell of lot better than zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And often people go all or nothing just </v>

405
00:27:11.551 --> 00:27:13.560
<v Speaker 1>like they do with their quitting </v>
<v Speaker 1>cigarettes.</v>

406
00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:16.110
<v Speaker 1>And in all those quit for a month and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then have a cigarette.</v>

407
00:27:16.111 --> 00:27:17.010
<v Speaker 1>And I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

408
00:27:17.011 --> 00:27:17.844
<v Speaker 1>now I'm now I've broken the pact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they'll smoke a whole pack and </v>

409
00:27:20.551 --> 00:27:23.550
<v Speaker 1>they'll be smoking again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to do that.</v>

410
00:27:23.551 --> 00:27:24.384
<v Speaker 1>You can just decide that you slipped and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're going to get back on the </v>

411
00:27:27.601 --> 00:27:30.600
<v Speaker 1>wagon again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And no one can take a long time.</v>

412
00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:34.080
<v Speaker 1>But I do believe that you need a better </v>
<v Speaker 1>vision of life,</v>

413
00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:34.943
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to find something to do that's </v>

414
00:27:36.211 --> 00:27:39.290
<v Speaker 1>better than alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that might take some,</v>

415
00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:40.253
<v Speaker 1>some real consideration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if alcohol is a very potent </v>

416
00:27:43.981 --> 00:27:44.814
<v Speaker 1>drug for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I would also say don't hesitate to </v>

417
00:27:47.371 --> 00:27:48.830
<v Speaker 1>try the NALTREXONE.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It.</v>

418
00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:53.430
<v Speaker 1>It's got a pretty decent clinical </v>
<v Speaker 1>history and it's basically harmless.</v>

419
00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:58.820
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've listened carefully to your Cain and</v>

420
00:28:00.951 --> 00:28:01.784
<v Speaker 1>Abel lecture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but waves of contempt for existence </v>

421
00:28:04.221 --> 00:28:05.054
<v Speaker 1>itself keep coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a part of me that revels in </v>

422
00:28:07.521 --> 00:28:11.420
<v Speaker 1>riding these waves waves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but can I harness them for good?</v>

423
00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:13.370
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys,</v>

424
00:28:13.371 --> 00:28:14.204
<v Speaker 1>you ask the hardest questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Waves of contempt of exists for </v>

425
00:28:18.051 --> 00:28:20.120
<v Speaker 1>existence itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep coming.</v>

426
00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:29.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess what I would say is</v>

427
00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:41.340
<v Speaker 1>it's probably time for a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual psychoanalysis.</v>

428
00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:44.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't necessarily mean that you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to go and find a therapist.</v>

429
00:28:44.861 --> 00:28:45.694
<v Speaker 1>I would say</v>

430
00:28:48.010 --> 00:28:49.390
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're generalizing.</v>

431
00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:50.253
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see waves of contempt for existence </v>

432
00:28:52.061 --> 00:28:53.050
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep coming,</v>

433
00:28:53.051 --> 00:28:55.300
<v Speaker 1>but I don't believe that that's exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

434
00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:57.970
<v Speaker 1>And I'm certainly not accusing you of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being deceitful.</v>

435
00:28:58.010 --> 00:29:00.190
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more like low resolution.</v>

436
00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:02.013
<v Speaker 1>My suspicions are is that there's a set </v>
<v Speaker 1>of experiences that you've had that are </v>

437
00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:06.903
<v Speaker 1>characteristic to your own personal life</v>
<v Speaker 1>that have caused you to do caused you </v>

438
00:29:11.381 --> 00:29:12.214
<v Speaker 1>some bitterness and some resentment and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that those haven't been thought through </v>

439
00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:20.860
<v Speaker 1>and usually thinking through means at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least in some part,</v>

440
00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:21.753
<v Speaker 1>trying to take as much responsibility </v>
<v Speaker 1>for those for altering the conditions </v>

441
00:29:25.481 --> 00:29:28.900
<v Speaker 1>under which those things happen going </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward into the future as possible.</v>

442
00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:33.700
<v Speaker 1>Like the purpose of memories to stop you</v>
<v Speaker 1>from doing the same stupid things in the</v>

443
00:29:33.701 --> 00:29:34.534
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

444
00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:35.463
<v Speaker 1>That that's the purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you've had experiences that </v>

445
00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:39.393
<v Speaker 1>have made you bitter and resentful or </v>
<v Speaker 1>are still in experiences that are doing </v>

446
00:29:43.031 --> 00:29:43.864
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you need to do a careful micro </v>

447
00:29:45.421 --> 00:29:46.254
<v Speaker 1>analysis of what those are and see if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see if you can flip your </v>

448
00:29:49.271 --> 00:29:50.590
<v Speaker 1>attitude in some matter.</v>

449
00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:52.810
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying this is easy,</v>

450
00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:53.673
<v Speaker 1>but the first thing you can do is at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least figure out what those memories </v>

451
00:29:56.771 --> 00:30:00.430
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I might recommend trying to pass the</v>

452
00:30:00.431 --> 00:30:01.264
<v Speaker 1>authoring program because what the past </v>
<v Speaker 1>authoring program does is ask you to </v>

453
00:30:04.931 --> 00:30:05.764
<v Speaker 1>break your life up into six parks and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then to identify the emotionally </v>

454
00:30:09.731 --> 00:30:14.731
<v Speaker 1>significant occurrences during each of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those epochs and you can kind of tell if</v>

455
00:30:14.921 --> 00:30:17.740
<v Speaker 1>something needs work from a memory </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>

456
00:30:17.741 --> 00:30:22.350
<v Speaker 1>if if it occurred more than about 18 </v>
<v Speaker 1>months ago and when you remember it,</v>

457
00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:23.193
<v Speaker 1>it still causes like a wave of sadness </v>
<v Speaker 1>or anger or really any kind of negative </v>

458
00:30:27.161 --> 00:30:27.994
<v Speaker 1>emotion because what that means is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain is still targeting that </v>

459
00:30:31.331 --> 00:30:32.164
<v Speaker 1>experience as threatening and unexplored</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what that means is that in some </v>

460
00:30:36.611 --> 00:30:37.444
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of you or a part of the that could </v>

461
00:30:39.071 --> 00:30:42.880
<v Speaker 1>exist is still stuck in that memory </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can go back and do a careful</v>

462
00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:44.253
<v Speaker 1>causal analysis of the events that led </v>
<v Speaker 1>up to the unfortunate circumstance and </v>

463
00:30:49.270 --> 00:30:53.860
<v Speaker 1>try to map out your role and even if </v>
<v Speaker 1>your role is minor,</v>

464
00:30:54.250 --> 00:30:56.980
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be things that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could have done differently to avoid it.</v>

465
00:30:57.110 --> 00:30:59.080
<v Speaker 1>And that's what you need to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the future.</v>

466
00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:04.270
<v Speaker 1>I would say you try to shed all your </v>
<v Speaker 1>personal resentment.</v>

467
00:31:04.570 --> 00:31:08.170
<v Speaker 1>A part of that too is to not take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not take things too personally.</v>

468
00:31:08.171 --> 00:31:10.930
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like one of the advantages of developing</v>

469
00:31:10.931 --> 00:31:11.764
<v Speaker 1>what I would regard as a mythologically </v>
<v Speaker 1>centered view of the cosmos is that you </v>

470
00:31:15.461 --> 00:31:16.294
<v Speaker 1>understand that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason there's nothing personal </v>

471
00:31:20.201 --> 00:31:22.270
<v Speaker 1>about the fact that terrible things </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened to you.</v>

472
00:31:22.271 --> 00:31:24.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you're directly causally involved</v>

473
00:31:24.491 --> 00:31:25.324
<v Speaker 1>as as it says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe in the Old Testament rains on </v>

474
00:31:28.001 --> 00:31:31.810
<v Speaker 1>the just and the unjust alike and no </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are,</v>

475
00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:32.793
<v Speaker 1>and this is an existentialist motif.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The tragedy and difficulty and even the </v>

476
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:37.833
<v Speaker 1>confrontation with evil are built into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the structure of existence and it's not </v>

477
00:31:41.081 --> 00:31:45.040
<v Speaker 1>aimed at you personally and it while as </v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

478
00:31:45.041 --> 00:31:48.550
<v Speaker 1>it may be the price that we pay for </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence itself and you can say,</v>

479
00:31:48.551 --> 00:31:52.230
<v Speaker 1>well that price is too high to pay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but well,</v>

480
00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:54.580
<v Speaker 1>as I mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you start taking that way,</v>

481
00:31:54.581 --> 00:31:56.500
<v Speaker 1>then you make everything much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much worse.</v>

482
00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:57.783
<v Speaker 1>It seems better to shoulder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're cross voluntarily and stumble </v>

483
00:32:01.911 --> 00:32:03.880
<v Speaker 1>forward towards the light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

484
00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:05.043
<v Speaker 1>That's the best strategy and I would say</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that just because it's the best </v>

485
00:32:08.261 --> 00:32:11.830
<v Speaker 1>strategy doesn't even necessarily mean </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's always going to work like this</v>

486
00:32:11.831 --> 00:32:16.570
<v Speaker 1>is no optimistic scenario like a dragon </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight is no optimistic scenario.</v>

487
00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:17.733
<v Speaker 1>Confront the dragon and get the gold and</v>
<v Speaker 1>get the girl and bring it back to to </v>

488
00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:25.920
<v Speaker 1>share with the community the gold and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that sounds all well and good,</v>

489
00:32:26.021 --> 00:32:28.900
<v Speaker 1>but after all it is a dragon and many </v>
<v Speaker 1>people get eaten by them.</v>

490
00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:32.020
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the myth basically says,</v>

491
00:32:32.021 --> 00:32:32.854
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your best bet is to open your eyes and </v>

492
00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:36.003
<v Speaker 1>speak the truth and look forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forthright and confront the things that </v>

493
00:32:39.550 --> 00:32:40.383
<v Speaker 1>are the hydrus that are raising their </v>
<v Speaker 1>hands and their tentacles constantly to </v>

494
00:32:45.170 --> 00:32:47.870
<v Speaker 1>frighten you and stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to fight the tyranny of,</v>

495
00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:50.680
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the social structure when,</v>

496
00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:55.280
<v Speaker 1>when it's oppressing you unduly and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's.</v>

497
00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:57.920
<v Speaker 1>And that's what you have to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I would say if,</v>

498
00:32:58.180 --> 00:32:59.013
<v Speaker 1>if contempt is there now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now it's really worth digging into </v>

499
00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:04.040
<v Speaker 1>because that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would also be the source.</v>

500
00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:05.113
<v Speaker 1>That would be the place where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>discover union shattered because you </v>

501
00:33:07.311 --> 00:33:08.144
<v Speaker 1>would discover depth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Contempt is an unbelievably destructive </v>

502
00:33:10.701 --> 00:33:11.534
<v Speaker 1>force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Contempt is a particularly destructive </v>

503
00:33:12.921 --> 00:33:16.670
<v Speaker 1>force and it would be useful for you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>try to think about.</v>

504
00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:18.650
<v Speaker 1>You can use fantasy to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

505
00:33:18.651 --> 00:33:21.470
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you let that contempt manifest itself</v>

506
00:33:21.471 --> 00:33:26.150
<v Speaker 1>fully in like a dream or a daydream and </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you let it go on a rampage.</v>

507
00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:28.850
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the vision exactly?</v>

508
00:33:29.230 --> 00:33:31.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean is it the destruction of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>town?</v>

509
00:33:31.630 --> 00:33:32.463
<v Speaker 1>Is the destruction of the country?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you want the entire world to blow up </v>

510
00:33:34.971 --> 00:33:37.090
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or are there specific people that you're</v>

511
00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:39.290
<v Speaker 1>angry out or maybe you're angry at </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

512
00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:44.320
<v Speaker 1>like you need to figure out those waves </v>
<v Speaker 1>of contempt or unarticulated elements of</v>

513
00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:47.060
<v Speaker 1>experience and they're part of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>shadow.</v>

514
00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:51.590
<v Speaker 1>So can you harness them for good?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

515
00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:54.770
<v Speaker 1>I think the more you understand your </v>
<v Speaker 1>dark urges,</v>

516
00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:55.993
<v Speaker 1>the more likely you are to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>regulate and control them and to use </v>

517
00:33:59.541 --> 00:34:03.530
<v Speaker 1>them as part of your power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When a person or authority,</v>

518
00:34:03.531 --> 00:34:04.364
<v Speaker 1>let's say a person who has authority is </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who's integrated the dangerous </v>

519
00:34:08.151 --> 00:34:08.984
<v Speaker 1>parts of themselves and that's part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what gives their words Gravitas and </v>

520
00:34:11.601 --> 00:34:14.480
<v Speaker 1>weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so yes,</v>

521
00:34:14.481 --> 00:34:16.460
<v Speaker 1>I think you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can harness them for good.</v>

522
00:34:16.490 --> 00:34:17.323
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's the right thing to </v>

523
00:34:19.071 --> 00:34:19.904
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it will involve a fair bit of </v>

524
00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:25.040
<v Speaker 1>painful soul searching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

525
00:34:26.050 --> 00:34:28.250
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see what else we've got here.</v>

526
00:34:39.150 --> 00:34:39.983
<v Speaker 1>Can you hazard a guess where Europe is </v>
<v Speaker 1>clamping down on speech critical of </v>

527
00:34:42.421 --> 00:34:45.780
<v Speaker 1>Islam when Islam is causing lots of </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems with rape,</v>

528
00:34:45.781 --> 00:34:46.740
<v Speaker 1>gangs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrorism,</v>

529
00:34:46.741 --> 00:34:48.840
<v Speaker 1>and generally being a menace?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

530
00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.290
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose the first,</v>

531
00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:59.850
<v Speaker 1>let's say if I was going to oppose that </v>
<v Speaker 1>statement,</v>

532
00:34:59.851 --> 00:35:03.720
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well perhaps it's a propaganda stick.</v>

533
00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:06.900
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it,</v>

534
00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:11.960
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy to blame what's happening in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe on Islamic immigrants?</v>

535
00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:16.500
<v Speaker 1>I guess part of the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that at least as far as I can tell,</v>

536
00:35:16.501 --> 00:35:17.334
<v Speaker 1>the news has become sufficiently </v>
<v Speaker 1>unreliable because it's so polarized </v>

537
00:35:20.341 --> 00:35:22.140
<v Speaker 1>that we can't really tell what's going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

538
00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:23.453
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the reason that you're at this </v>

539
00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:27.593
<v Speaker 1>time being down on speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>critical of Islam is partly the same </v>

540
00:35:30.421 --> 00:35:31.254
<v Speaker 1>reason that the entire Western world is </v>
<v Speaker 1>clamping down on speech that's critical </v>

541
00:35:34.591 --> 00:35:37.830
<v Speaker 1>of anything that is associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>identity,</v>

542
00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:38.040
<v Speaker 1>which</v>

543
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:42.120
<v Speaker 3>is pretty much any set of ideas that </v>
<v Speaker 3>unites people and it's.</v>

544
00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:46.320
<v Speaker 3>It's a consequence of the collective </v>
<v Speaker 3>decision that we made.</v>

545
00:35:46.321 --> 00:35:47.154
<v Speaker 3>That egalitarianism and a conflict </v>
<v Speaker 3>avoidance constitute the two highest </v>

546
00:35:52.801 --> 00:35:55.860
<v Speaker 3>virtues and they trump everything else </v>
<v Speaker 3>including free speech.</v>

547
00:35:56.460 --> 00:36:01.050
<v Speaker 3>Now why that's happened is very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very difficult thing to say.</v>

548
00:36:01.051 --> 00:36:01.884
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I suspect to some degree that it's a </v>

549
00:36:04.531 --> 00:36:07.770
<v Speaker 3>consequence of women becoming involved </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the political system,</v>

550
00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:08.993
<v Speaker 3>which is something that we've never </v>
<v Speaker 3>experienced before and women are more </v>

551
00:36:12.031 --> 00:36:16.650
<v Speaker 3>agreeable</v>
<v Speaker 3>by nature than men and variable.</v>

552
00:36:16.651 --> 00:36:19.860
<v Speaker 3>People are are compassionate towards </v>
<v Speaker 3>those.</v>

553
00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:23.610
<v Speaker 3>They see a suffering and that seems to </v>
<v Speaker 3>include any minority,</v>

554
00:36:23.611 --> 00:36:27.510
<v Speaker 3>especially when you combine that with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of neo Marxist doctrine that claims</v>

555
00:36:27.511 --> 00:36:30.240
<v Speaker 3>that anyone who has an advantage swiped </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

556
00:36:30.241 --> 00:36:31.074
<v Speaker 3>And I think in the Islamic situation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can get it real conflict there </v>

557
00:36:34.261 --> 00:36:35.094
<v Speaker 3>because it's obviously the case that </v>
<v Speaker 3>many Islamic practices are not </v>

558
00:36:39.121 --> 00:36:43.020
<v Speaker 3>commensurate with postmodern neo Marxist</v>
<v Speaker 3>feminism,</v>

559
00:36:43.021 --> 00:36:43.854
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they seem to get a free pass and I </v>

560
00:36:45.331 --> 00:36:46.164
<v Speaker 3>guess that's because the idea that all </v>
<v Speaker 3>cultures are equal trumps the </v>

561
00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:53.970
<v Speaker 3>requirement for human rights for women.</v>

562
00:36:54.350 --> 00:36:55.183
<v Speaker 3>And and maybe the other thing that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>even darker is that there's a fair bit </v>

563
00:37:00.001 --> 00:37:00.834
<v Speaker 3>of revolutionary fervor in the more </v>
<v Speaker 3>radical end of the political spectrum </v>

564
00:37:05.381 --> 00:37:09.690
<v Speaker 3>and that radical fervor is devoted </v>
<v Speaker 3>towards tearing down the patriarchy.</v>

565
00:37:09.691 --> 00:37:12.270
<v Speaker 3>And of course that's basically Western </v>
<v Speaker 3>civilization.</v>

566
00:37:12.271 --> 00:37:13.104
<v Speaker 3>And so if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because Islam isn't part of Western </v>

567
00:37:15.991 --> 00:37:19.920
<v Speaker 3>civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it can be seen as an ally in that,</v>

568
00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:22.920
<v Speaker 3>in that attempt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it looks like to me.</v>

569
00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:28.110
<v Speaker 3>I also think that ignorance and all of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that contribute.</v>

570
00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:28.973
<v Speaker 3>It isn't obvious that people who</v>
<v Speaker 3>are afraid of such things as </v>

571
00:37:33.901 --> 00:37:37.200
<v Speaker 3>Islamophobia really understand anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>about Islam.</v>

572
00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:39.540
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't say I understand anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>about Islam,</v>

573
00:37:39.541 --> 00:37:41.160
<v Speaker 3>even though I've read a fair bit about </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

574
00:37:41.161 --> 00:37:45.540
<v Speaker 3>It's very difficult to put yourself </v>
<v Speaker 3>inside a different belief system.</v>

575
00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:46.823
<v Speaker 3>I'm somewhat apprehensive about Islam </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it looks to me like it's a </v>

576
00:37:52.201 --> 00:37:53.034
<v Speaker 3>totalizing system as well as a religion </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's a totalizing system because </v>

577
00:37:57.331 --> 00:37:59.400
<v Speaker 3>everything has to come under his </v>
<v Speaker 3>purview,</v>

578
00:37:59.401 --> 00:38:03.960
<v Speaker 3>including law and and everything that </v>
<v Speaker 3>goes along with that.</v>

579
00:38:03.961 --> 00:38:04.794
<v Speaker 3>There's no separation between church and</v>
<v Speaker 3>state and so I don't see how that's </v>

580
00:38:08.221 --> 00:38:09.054
<v Speaker 3>commensurate with the western mode of </v>
<v Speaker 3>existence and I don't think people want </v>

581
00:38:12.031 --> 00:38:14.610
<v Speaker 3>to have that conversation because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to say,</v>

582
00:38:14.611 --> 00:38:15.990
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

583
00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:19.440
<v Speaker 3>Everyone diverse as they are and </v>
<v Speaker 3>important as that.</v>

584
00:38:19.441 --> 00:38:23.640
<v Speaker 3>Diversity is apparently such that </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone has to be represented equally.</v>

585
00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:24.743
<v Speaker 3>The diversity isn't really of anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>about anything fundamental and we can </v>

586
00:38:28.681 --> 00:38:29.514
<v Speaker 3>all get along without a problem and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm afraid that that's extraordinarily </v>

587
00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:36.543
<v Speaker 3>naive.</v>

588
00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:42.240
<v Speaker 1>And then I suppose there's also an </v>
<v Speaker 1>element of something like Western guilt.</v>

589
00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:47.770
<v Speaker 1>I guess perhaps for what has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>described as our imperialists past</v>

590
00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:50.250
<v Speaker 4>the</v>

591
00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:52.490
<v Speaker 1>that there's been a very longterm </v>
<v Speaker 1>assault</v>

592
00:38:52.590 --> 00:38:54.900
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the,</v>

593
00:38:55.650 --> 00:38:56.910
<v Speaker 4>what would you call moral</v>

594
00:38:57.940 --> 00:38:58.773
<v Speaker 1>on the morality of the West.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're often viewed as the rapers and </v>

595
00:39:02.441 --> 00:39:03.274
<v Speaker 1>pillagers of the world and that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes along with the environmentalist </v>

596
00:39:05.681 --> 00:39:06.514
<v Speaker 1>ethos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think we do have a fair bit of </v>

597
00:39:09.701 --> 00:39:12.130
<v Speaker 1>guilt about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's warranted or not.</v>

598
00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:14.253
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>history is a bloody nightmare and it </v>

599
00:39:15.551 --> 00:39:16.384
<v Speaker 1>doesn't matter where you look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say at least in the west is </v>

600
00:39:18.821 --> 00:39:21.940
<v Speaker 1>brought advantages along with its </v>
<v Speaker 1>disadvantages.</v>

601
00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:23.703
<v Speaker 1>And I think that our attitude towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuality is fundamentally correct </v>

602
00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:28.273
<v Speaker 1>and absolutely vital.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would also say that the only </v>

603
00:39:30.461 --> 00:39:33.820
<v Speaker 1>countries in the world that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially worth living in,</v>

604
00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:34.833
<v Speaker 1>in any real sense are the ones that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>predicated on the Judeo Christian </v>

605
00:39:38.110 --> 00:39:42.550
<v Speaker 1>tradition and manifested in western the </v>
<v Speaker 1>western body of laws.</v>

606
00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:43.923
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's still plenty of guilt and </v>

607
00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:49.160
<v Speaker 1>there's plenty of people who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

608
00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:50.043
<v Speaker 1>who are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what contemptuous of being out as we </v>

609
00:39:54.221 --> 00:39:55.630
<v Speaker 1>discussed in the last question.</v>

610
00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:56.463
<v Speaker 1>And also angry with the political system</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're powerless or maybe </v>

611
00:39:59.411 --> 00:40:02.110
<v Speaker 1>they've been hurt by male authority </v>
<v Speaker 1>figures.</v>

612
00:40:02.490 --> 00:40:04.420
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that happens very frequently.</v>

613
00:40:04.421 --> 00:40:09.421
<v Speaker 1>And so they have absolutely no trust in </v>
<v Speaker 1>higher in hierarchical structures.</v>

614
00:40:10.061 --> 00:40:10.894
<v Speaker 1>And there you might add to that to </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain amount of laziness because the </v>

615
00:40:15.101 --> 00:40:15.934
<v Speaker 1>thing about hierarchical structures is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they impose values on people and </v>

616
00:40:18.821 --> 00:40:19.654
<v Speaker 1>then in order to progress in that value </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure that you have to discipline </v>

617
00:40:21.941 --> 00:40:22.774
<v Speaker 1>yourself and work hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And many of the radical leftists </v>

618
00:40:25.811 --> 00:40:26.644
<v Speaker 1>happened to be very low in </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness and so they don't </v>

619
00:40:29.081 --> 00:40:32.980
<v Speaker 1>believe in hard work and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that people get to where they're</v>

620
00:40:32.981 --> 00:40:35.920
<v Speaker 1>going by hard work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

621
00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:37.090
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one other thing,</v>

622
00:40:37.091 --> 00:40:37.924
<v Speaker 1>there's a group of people I think who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are basically personality disorder and </v>

623
00:40:40.601 --> 00:40:41.434
<v Speaker 1>in those are the ones that had never had</v>
<v Speaker 1>a positive relationship with anything </v>

624
00:40:44.771 --> 00:40:45.760
<v Speaker 1>that was masculine.</v>

625
00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:50.170
<v Speaker 1>And so whenever they see anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>masculine that has motive power and that</v>

626
00:40:50.171 --> 00:40:53.560
<v Speaker 1>would include authority and competence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just power,</v>

627
00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:55.263
<v Speaker 1>they assume that that's tyrannical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's part of the postmodern </v>

628
00:40:58.121 --> 00:40:58.954
<v Speaker 1>assumption that all power higher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all hierarchies are hierarchies of </v>

629
00:41:01.601 --> 00:41:03.770
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the truth of the matter is,</v>

630
00:41:03.771 --> 00:41:04.604
<v Speaker 1>is that hierarchies in the West are </v>
<v Speaker 1>usually hierarchies of authority and </v>

631
00:41:07.810 --> 00:41:09.460
<v Speaker 1>competence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

632
00:41:09.461 --> 00:41:10.294
<v Speaker 1>they're oriented towards getting a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain task done and they actually do </v>

633
00:41:12.611 --> 00:41:14.740
<v Speaker 1>get the task done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

634
00:41:14.741 --> 00:41:19.741
<v Speaker 1>but we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm dubious about our own ethical,</v>

635
00:41:22.330 --> 00:41:25.210
<v Speaker 1>what would you say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Integrity,</v>

636
00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:26.373
<v Speaker 1>and I guess that's also why it's of </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular importance for people to try </v>

637
00:41:29.351 --> 00:41:30.184
<v Speaker 1>to act honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you don't act honestly and </v>

638
00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:33.913
<v Speaker 1>then you start to doubt your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>integrity and then when people come </v>

639
00:41:35.991 --> 00:41:36.824
<v Speaker 1>after you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be weak and that's a </v>

640
00:41:38.411 --> 00:41:40.670
<v Speaker 1>really bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

641
00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:44.960
<v Speaker 1>how has the online personality tests </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming along?</v>

642
00:41:45.110 --> 00:41:46.130
<v Speaker 1>Can't wait for it.</v>

643
00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:49.063
<v Speaker 1>It's coming along pretty well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have all the reports written and we </v>

644
00:41:52.401 --> 00:41:53.700
<v Speaker 1>have the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

645
00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:57.200
<v Speaker 1>the underlying computer architecture </v>
<v Speaker 1>finished,</v>

646
00:41:57.201 --> 00:42:00.050
<v Speaker 1>and at the moment we're just polishing </v>
<v Speaker 1>it up essentially.</v>

647
00:42:00.051 --> 00:42:00.884
<v Speaker 1>And we're hoping that you'll be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get a very detailed description of all </v>

648
00:42:05.871 --> 00:42:08.120
<v Speaker 1>five of the big five traits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

649
00:42:08.121 --> 00:42:10.850
<v Speaker 1>Extroversion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a positive emotion dimension.</v>

650
00:42:12.110 --> 00:42:14.840
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that will break down into enthusiasm and</v>

651
00:42:14.841 --> 00:42:19.700
<v Speaker 1>assertiveness and neuroticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That breaks down into withdrawal.</v>

652
00:42:19.730 --> 00:42:23.750
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're in a state of withdrawal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're frozen with fear and,</v>

653
00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:26.390
<v Speaker 1>and don't want to do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're afraid to go out.</v>

654
00:42:26.450 --> 00:42:27.283
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're afraid to engage in any complex </v>

655
00:42:29.301 --> 00:42:32.270
<v Speaker 1>task because you might fail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll doubt yourself intensely.</v>

656
00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:33.433
<v Speaker 1>That's withdrawal in neuroticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then volatility is that kind of </v>

657
00:42:36.351 --> 00:42:39.800
<v Speaker 1>impulsive touchiness that people often </v>
<v Speaker 1>develop when they're in a bad mood,</v>

658
00:42:39.801 --> 00:42:40.634
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where if you reach your finger up to </v>

659
00:42:41.631 --> 00:42:42.464
<v Speaker 1>touch them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll flinch and maybe slap you and </v>

660
00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:44.993
<v Speaker 1>they're over sensitive to small slights </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they don't have much of a sense of </v>

661
00:42:48.411 --> 00:42:49.220
<v Speaker 1>humor.</v>

662
00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:50.053
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and agreeableness doubt subdivides into </v>

663
00:42:52.641 --> 00:42:57.050
<v Speaker 1>compassion and politeness and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberal types are more compassionate and</v>

664
00:42:57.380 --> 00:42:58.213
<v Speaker 1>the conservative types are more polite </v>
<v Speaker 1>and politeness seems to be something </v>

665
00:43:02.001 --> 00:43:02.834
<v Speaker 1>like acting in accordance with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>social norms governing interpersonal </v>

666
00:43:06.291 --> 00:43:07.124
<v Speaker 1>interaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas compassion seems to be the </v>

667
00:43:09.261 --> 00:43:11.900
<v Speaker 1>proclivity to side with the weakest </v>
<v Speaker 1>party,</v>

668
00:43:12.110 --> 00:43:12.943
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's the primary maternal </v>

669
00:43:15.321 --> 00:43:20.321
<v Speaker 1>dimension because the perhaps along with</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher levels of negative emotion,</v>

670
00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:25.880
<v Speaker 1>because it's obviously the case that </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're dealing with children,</v>

671
00:43:25.881 --> 00:43:26.714
<v Speaker 1>especially infants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you should take the side of the </v>

672
00:43:29.391 --> 00:43:32.420
<v Speaker 1>weaker party pretty much no matter what </v>
<v Speaker 1>the logical argument.</v>

673
00:43:32.421 --> 00:43:36.200
<v Speaker 1>It's right because an infant who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>crying is always right,</v>

674
00:43:36.290 --> 00:43:40.250
<v Speaker 1>especially if it's under a year old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no logic to it.</v>

675
00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:41.113
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an a priori fact that a crying </v>

676
00:43:42.951 --> 00:43:47.060
<v Speaker 1>infant is correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we don't know how that translates</v>

677
00:43:47.061 --> 00:43:50.510
<v Speaker 1>into the political sphere because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most direct translation would be,</v>

678
00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:54.260
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a complaining person is always right.</v>

679
00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:55.760
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

680
00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:56.593
<v Speaker 1>I see that manifesting itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say quite clearly in the </v>

681
00:43:59.691 --> 00:44:00.524
<v Speaker 1>politically correct domain is that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>always side with the person who's </v>

682
00:44:04.310 --> 00:44:05.143
<v Speaker 1>manifesting negative emotion and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>always assume that there's an external </v>

683
00:44:08.841 --> 00:44:12.050
<v Speaker 1>reason that needs to be rectified in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order to,</v>

684
00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:14.060
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to deal with that.</v>

685
00:44:14.061 --> 00:44:15.110
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

686
00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:16.303
<v Speaker 1>it isn't obvious to me that </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness as an ethic is something </v>

687
00:44:18.801 --> 00:44:22.100
<v Speaker 1>that's transformable into the political </v>
<v Speaker 1>or the adult landscape.</v>

688
00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:23.533
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

689
00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:25.513
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

690
00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:27.343
<v Speaker 1>we don't know these sorts of things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't even talk about them because </v>

691
00:44:29.781 --> 00:44:32.880
<v Speaker 1>people automatically assume that that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexist,</v>

692
00:44:32.970 --> 00:44:37.190
<v Speaker 1>misogynist stick or even though there </v>
<v Speaker 1>are agreeable man as well as a grant,</v>

693
00:44:37.191 --> 00:44:41.070
<v Speaker 1>but women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because men are quite maternal for,</v>

694
00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:41.933
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the kind of large apes and mammals </v>

695
00:44:43.861 --> 00:44:44.694
<v Speaker 1>that we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we need to take these sorts of </v>

696
00:44:46.771 --> 00:44:47.604
<v Speaker 1>things seriously because it isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>obvious to me that in an ethic of </v>

697
00:44:50.161 --> 00:44:53.470
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness can govern a complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics.</v>

698
00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:54.433
<v Speaker 1>Looks to me more like conscientiousness </v>
<v Speaker 1>is something that needs to govern arm's </v>

699
00:44:57.841 --> 00:44:59.820
<v Speaker 1>length,</v>
<v Speaker 1>transactions and that sort of thing.</v>

700
00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:00.713
<v Speaker 1>Rather than treating everyone like kin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you just can't do so you don't </v>

701
00:45:03.241 --> 00:45:05.850
<v Speaker 1>have the energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>

702
00:45:05.851 --> 00:45:06.684
<v Speaker 1>The test will also associate </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientious or assess </v>

703
00:45:09.450 --> 00:45:11.790
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's orderliness,</v>

704
00:45:11.791 --> 00:45:14.070
<v Speaker 1>which is seems to be associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>disgust,</v>

705
00:45:14.071 --> 00:45:19.071
<v Speaker 1>sensitivity and is a good predictor of </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative belief and industriousness,</v>

706
00:45:19.261 --> 00:45:23.190
<v Speaker 1>which is something like the well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's what it says exactly.</v>

707
00:45:23.191 --> 00:45:28.191
<v Speaker 1>It's the proclivity to engage in </v>
<v Speaker 1>effortful work towards a defined goal in</v>

708
00:45:28.261 --> 00:45:29.094
<v Speaker 1>a reliable manner and it's the second </v>
<v Speaker 1>best predictor of longterm life success </v>

709
00:45:32.341 --> 00:45:35.250
<v Speaker 1>after Icu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the final thing it'll upset,</v>

710
00:45:35.550 --> 00:45:36.383
<v Speaker 1>assesses openness to experience which is</v>
<v Speaker 1>more or less half creativity at half </v>

711
00:45:41.491 --> 00:45:46.491
<v Speaker 1>interest in ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you take the test,</v>

712
00:45:46.831 --> 00:45:47.664
<v Speaker 1>you'll get a boat up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about a 10 page report and sketch </v>

713
00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:50.573
<v Speaker 1>quite detailed and it tells you where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you fit on a percentile basis and what </v>

714
00:45:55.561 --> 00:45:58.170
<v Speaker 1>your strengths and weaknesses are going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be as a consequence.</v>

715
00:45:58.170 --> 00:45:59.003
<v Speaker 1>And we're going to produce a couple's </v>
<v Speaker 1>version so that two of you can take it </v>

716
00:46:02.191 --> 00:46:05.880
<v Speaker 1>and then you'll get a report that tells </v>
<v Speaker 1>you how you're similar and different and</v>

717
00:46:05.881 --> 00:46:06.714
<v Speaker 1>where you're likely to to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>disagreements and agreements where it's </v>

718
00:46:09.721 --> 00:46:10.554
<v Speaker 1>going to be difficult to negotiate a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consensus that'd be where your Wyatt </v>

719
00:46:13.490 --> 00:46:14.323
<v Speaker 1>widely different from one another on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>trait that gets hard for an extrovert </v>

720
00:46:18.661 --> 00:46:22.530
<v Speaker 1>and an introvert to come to an agreement</v>
<v Speaker 1>about how much socializing they're going</v>

721
00:46:22.531 --> 00:46:24.810
<v Speaker 1>to do because the extrovert says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

722
00:46:24.811 --> 00:46:27.030
<v Speaker 1>let's socialize all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the introvert says,</v>

723
00:46:27.031 --> 00:46:27.510
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

724
00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:31.980
<v Speaker 1>once a year would be plenty for me and </v>
<v Speaker 1>those aren't opinions right there.</v>

725
00:46:32.110 --> 00:46:32.943
<v Speaker 1>They're built in preferences that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>far beneath the realm of opinion and if </v>

726
00:46:37.321 --> 00:46:39.720
<v Speaker 1>you're high in openness and your partner</v>
<v Speaker 1>is low in openness,</v>

727
00:46:39.721 --> 00:46:40.554
<v Speaker 1>like you're going to be interested in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the theater and arts and literature and </v>

728
00:46:44.310 --> 00:46:45.143
<v Speaker 1>philosophy and and talking about ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>and and going to museums and that sort </v>

729
00:46:49.951 --> 00:46:50.220
<v Speaker 1>of thing.</v>

730
00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:53.210
<v Speaker 1>And your partner is in some sense it </v>
<v Speaker 1>will be like they're colorblind.</v>

731
00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:56.220
<v Speaker 1>They just won't find that sort of thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>engaging and interesting at all.</v>

732
00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:57.653
<v Speaker 1>And you might be able to shift someone a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit to a higher degree of </v>

733
00:47:00.721 --> 00:47:01.590
<v Speaker 1>openness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

734
00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:03.450
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not an easy thing to do.</v>

735
00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:04.373
<v Speaker 1>So we think in the literature seems to </v>
<v Speaker 1>indicate that you should be fairly well </v>

736
00:47:08.851 --> 00:47:11.460
<v Speaker 1>matched on most of your traits with your</v>
<v Speaker 1>partner,</v>

737
00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:12.613
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the possible exception of </v>

738
00:47:13.471 --> 00:47:16.780
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism because it isn't obvious </v>
<v Speaker 1>that two people are highly neurotic,</v>

739
00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:17.623
<v Speaker 1>can get along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

740
00:47:17.850 --> 00:47:20.700
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism is a pretty good predictor </v>
<v Speaker 1>of marital unhappiness,</v>

741
00:47:20.701 --> 00:47:24.270
<v Speaker 1>just like it's a good predictor of every</v>
<v Speaker 1>other form of unhappiness.</v>

742
00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:30.020
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>Benjamin would says,</v>

743
00:47:46.381 --> 00:47:48.750
<v Speaker 1>my room is a den of iniquity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

744
00:47:48.751 --> 00:47:51.360
<v Speaker 1>congratulations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not an easy thing to pull off.</v>

745
00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:55.260
<v Speaker 1>I guess you might be asking yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's that student for you?</v>

746
00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:57.660
<v Speaker 1>Obviously you're being funny and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>just fine.</v>

747
00:47:57.661 --> 00:47:58.494
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

748
00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:11.530
<v Speaker 1>what advice would you give to someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking to quit porn?</v>

749
00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:13.233
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gave some advice a little earlier </v>

750
00:48:14.381 --> 00:48:15.214
<v Speaker 1>about quitting alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say it isn't that you're </v>

751
00:48:19.271 --> 00:48:20.104
<v Speaker 1>trying to quit porn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the right way to think about </v>

752
00:48:22.451 --> 00:48:23.284
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The right way to think about it is that </v>

753
00:48:24.401 --> 00:48:27.130
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to figure out how to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>a better life.</v>

754
00:48:27.670 --> 00:48:30.370
<v Speaker 1>And so you have to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

755
00:48:30.790 --> 00:48:31.623
<v Speaker 1>I would say do the future authoring </v>
<v Speaker 1>program and keep your porn addiction in </v>

756
00:48:34.721 --> 00:48:38.740
<v Speaker 1>mind and think so in the first part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the future authoring program,</v>

757
00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:43.810
<v Speaker 1>it asks you a bunch of questions about </v>
<v Speaker 1>what your life could be like in three to</v>

758
00:48:43.811 --> 00:48:44.644
<v Speaker 1>five years if you took care of yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you were someone that you cared </v>

759
00:48:46.901 --> 00:48:48.540
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

760
00:48:49.210 --> 00:48:50.043
<v Speaker 1>and then it asks you questions about </v>
<v Speaker 1>your friends and your family and your </v>

761
00:48:54.791 --> 00:48:58.530
<v Speaker 1>career and your time outside of work and</v>
<v Speaker 1>your health and you know,</v>

762
00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:01.690
<v Speaker 1>the important dimensions of life and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it asks you to spend</v>

763
00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:04.743
<v Speaker 1>20 minutes writing about how good your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life could be in three to five years if </v>

764
00:49:07.121 --> 00:49:09.340
<v Speaker 1>you got your act together and did what </v>
<v Speaker 1>was good for you.</v>

765
00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:12.160
<v Speaker 1>And then it asked you to write about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hail you could be in if you didn't.</v>

766
00:49:12.650 --> 00:49:16.510
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say you really need to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that because porn isn't the issue.</v>

767
00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:19.540
<v Speaker 1>The issue is that you're not living your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life the way you want to.</v>

768
00:49:19.541 --> 00:49:24.340
<v Speaker 1>And so you need a vision of life that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>more compelling than the porn.</v>

769
00:49:24.341 --> 00:49:27.570
<v Speaker 1>And you need a counter vision to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>frightens you know,</v>

770
00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:28.533
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise porn is obviously </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily gratifying in the short </v>

771
00:49:32.291 --> 00:49:32.940
<v Speaker 1>term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

772
00:49:32.940 --> 00:49:33.773
<v Speaker 1>but you seem to be suffering from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>medium to longterm consequences of its </v>

773
00:49:36.851 --> 00:49:37.684
<v Speaker 1>use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you need a story that you can </v>

774
00:49:40.421 --> 00:49:41.254
<v Speaker 1>tell yourself that's really deeply </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought through about why this is not </v>

775
00:49:44.831 --> 00:49:46.660
<v Speaker 1>appropriate for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's what?</v>

776
00:49:46.661 --> 00:49:47.494
<v Speaker 1>It's how it's hurting you and how it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>minimizing you admit perhaps making you </v>

777
00:49:50.741 --> 00:49:54.160
<v Speaker 1>embarrassed and ashamed and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>socially isolated and all of that.</v>

778
00:49:54.550 --> 00:49:55.383
<v Speaker 1>So I would say think about it as </v>
<v Speaker 1>cleaning up your psyche and your </v>

779
00:49:59.501 --> 00:50:02.030
<v Speaker 1>behavior rather than merely start </v>
<v Speaker 1>stopping,</v>

780
00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:04.453
<v Speaker 1>stopping poor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you also might want to write down </v>

781
00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:07.863
<v Speaker 1>and you could do this in the negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>vision part of the future authoring </v>

782
00:50:10.421 --> 00:50:11.254
<v Speaker 1>program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to write down everything bad </v>

783
00:50:12.641 --> 00:50:13.474
<v Speaker 1>that you think porn is doing to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>because obviously you have some </v>

784
00:50:16.241 --> 00:50:18.790
<v Speaker 1>suspicions that this is not good for </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

785
00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:19.653
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That it's,</v>

786
00:50:19.890 --> 00:50:20.723
<v Speaker 1>it's actually harming you in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>important way and so you need to be </v>

787
00:50:24.911 --> 00:50:25.744
<v Speaker 1>fully cognizant of what those ways are </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then take them seriously and decide </v>

788
00:50:29.151 --> 00:50:29.984
<v Speaker 1>if that's the pathway through life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On which you wish to travel and so and </v>

789
00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:36.940
<v Speaker 1>then I would also say good luck to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

790
00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:39.860
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very good idea to identify one of</v>

791
00:50:39.861 --> 00:50:42.110
<v Speaker 1>your weaknesses and work on time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can.</v>

792
00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:44.670
<v Speaker 1>You can strengthen yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>substantially by doing that.</v>

793
00:50:47.810 --> 00:50:50.420
<v Speaker 1>Is there a way to take any of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>classes online?</v>

794
00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:53.240
<v Speaker 1>Will you be establishing an online </v>
<v Speaker 1>university?</v>

795
00:50:54.050 --> 00:50:57.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no way at the moment to take any</v>

796
00:50:57.081 --> 00:50:57.914
<v Speaker 1>of my classes online for credit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I presume is what you're asking </v>

797
00:51:02.410 --> 00:51:03.243
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the lectures that I've done for the </v>

798
00:51:04.401 --> 00:51:05.234
<v Speaker 1>classes are online on youtube for many </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the classes so you can get the </v>

799
00:51:09.801 --> 00:51:10.634
<v Speaker 1>information and you can do the reading</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't be accredited for it and </v>

800
00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:16.393
<v Speaker 1>that's partly due to University of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>University of Toronto hasn't set up the </v>

801
00:51:21.081 --> 00:51:23.960
<v Speaker 1>university to make that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>straightforward thing yet.</v>

802
00:51:24.020 --> 00:51:25.970
<v Speaker 1>And the accreditation problem is a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

803
00:51:26.570 --> 00:51:29.060
<v Speaker 1>Will you be establishing an online </v>
<v Speaker 1>university?</v>

804
00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:30.493
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

805
00:51:31.250 --> 00:51:33.590
<v Speaker 1>that depends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depends.</v>

806
00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:38.710
<v Speaker 1>My health has been uneven for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>substantial amount of time and when it's</v>

807
00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:40.213
<v Speaker 1>down as it is right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm probably only five percent as </v>

808
00:51:43.851 --> 00:51:47.270
<v Speaker 1>productive as I am when it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I'm functioning at full bore,</v>

809
00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:49.093
<v Speaker 1>I seem to have developed a series of or </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovered a series of food </v>

810
00:51:51.951 --> 00:51:56.150
<v Speaker 1>sensitivities that I share with my </v>
<v Speaker 1>daughter and it's very,</v>

811
00:51:56.180 --> 00:51:57.013
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reaction to eating the wrong thing </v>

812
00:51:58.581 --> 00:52:00.850
<v Speaker 1>is extremely vicious.</v>

813
00:52:01.070 --> 00:52:04.760
<v Speaker 1>Basically flattens me out for a month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

814
00:52:04.820 --> 00:52:08.330
<v Speaker 1>I can't think properly and I can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>organize my actions.</v>

815
00:52:08.331 --> 00:52:09.164
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would really very much like to pursue </v>

816
00:52:13.281 --> 00:52:16.430
<v Speaker 1>this idea of an online university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've talked to many people about it,</v>

817
00:52:16.970 --> 00:52:17.803
<v Speaker 1>but it's a very complex project and to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>large degree it's going to be dependent </v>

818
00:52:21.651 --> 00:52:24.830
<v Speaker 1>on the state of my health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I'm healthy,</v>

819
00:52:24.831 --> 00:52:28.550
<v Speaker 1>I can do a very large number of things </v>
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously and I'm very enthusiastic</v>

820
00:52:28.551 --> 00:52:32.120
<v Speaker 1>about them and very efficient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when I'm not,</v>

821
00:52:32.180 --> 00:52:33.013
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

822
00:52:33.230 --> 00:52:34.063
<v Speaker 1>I really wonder if I'm even going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to keep up the minimal </v>

823
00:52:37.970 --> 00:52:40.550
<v Speaker 1>responsibilities necessary to keep my </v>
<v Speaker 1>life in order.</v>

824
00:52:40.551 --> 00:52:42.620
<v Speaker 1>And that's actually very terrifying </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought.</v>

825
00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:45.960
<v Speaker 1>So I'd love to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

826
00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:46.813
<v Speaker 1>and I would also say I'm starting it to </v>
<v Speaker 1>some degree because I believe these </v>

827
00:52:50.511 --> 00:52:51.344
<v Speaker 1>biblical lectures are crucial to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>establishment of something like an on </v>

828
00:52:55.220 --> 00:53:00.220
<v Speaker 1>line humanities university because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that like our culture is made up</v>

829
00:53:01.911 --> 00:53:05.360
<v Speaker 1>of strata of stories that might be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good way of thinking about it.</v>

830
00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:10.160
<v Speaker 1>Like hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the levels of stories and the base story</v>

831
00:53:10.161 --> 00:53:10.994
<v Speaker 1>is definitely the stories that are laid </v>
<v Speaker 1>out in the Bible for better or for </v>

832
00:53:14.121 --> 00:53:17.450
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in order to understand our culture,</v>

833
00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:18.553
<v Speaker 1>I think you have to have a grounding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be grounded in an </v>

834
00:53:21.381 --> 00:53:22.214
<v Speaker 1>understanding of the Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm trying to make that as a </v>

835
00:53:26.311 --> 00:53:27.144
<v Speaker 1>religious in some sense as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not necessarily because I believe that </v>

836
00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:34.740
<v Speaker 1>an a religious approach to the Bible is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most appropriate,</v>

837
00:53:34.741 --> 00:53:35.574
<v Speaker 1>but because I want to investigate it </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the least amount of metaphysical </v>

838
00:53:39.301 --> 00:53:40.134
<v Speaker 1>baggage possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm hoping in that way to help </v>

839
00:53:43.350 --> 00:53:47.430
<v Speaker 1>people stabilize their identities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To eliminate the idea of the development</v>

840
00:53:47.431 --> 00:53:48.264
<v Speaker 1>of the divine individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which I think is Western culture is </v>

841
00:53:50.671 --> 00:53:54.090
<v Speaker 1>glorious contribution to human </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization.</v>

842
00:53:54.091 --> 00:53:56.670
<v Speaker 1>And the thing that lifted us all out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>slavery and,</v>

843
00:53:57.020 --> 00:53:58.010
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

844
00:53:58.100 --> 00:53:58.933
<v Speaker 1>and penury and serfdom and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of those subordinate roles into </v>

845
00:54:04.710 --> 00:54:09.450
<v Speaker 1>the society of relatively free and </v>
<v Speaker 1>autonomous individuals that we are today</v>

846
00:54:09.860 --> 00:54:10.693
<v Speaker 1>and we can't let that doe and I think it</v>
<v Speaker 1>will go unless we have something very </v>

847
00:54:13.471 --> 00:54:15.330
<v Speaker 1>strong metaphysically at the bottom.</v>

848
00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:16.493
<v Speaker 1>I think we're weak without it because we</v>
<v Speaker 1>fractionate and everybody believes a </v>

849
00:54:19.890 --> 00:54:21.990
<v Speaker 1>thousand different things and it's sorta</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

850
00:54:21.991 --> 00:54:23.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you saw what happened to that.</v>

851
00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:28.170
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wall Street protest,</v>

852
00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:29.600
<v Speaker 1>occupy Wall Street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

853
00:54:29.610 --> 00:54:30.443
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's no wonder people were irritated </v>

854
00:54:32.431 --> 00:54:33.264
<v Speaker 1>about what happened in 2008.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although periodic financial collapses </v>

855
00:54:37.291 --> 00:54:40.290
<v Speaker 1>are pretty common and it isn't always </v>
<v Speaker 1>obvious who to blame.</v>

856
00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:43.290
<v Speaker 1>A lot of that was innovation driven as </v>
<v Speaker 1>it turned out law.</v>

857
00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:44.513
<v Speaker 1>Some of it was corruption,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some of them was just unbridled </v>

858
00:54:46.621 --> 00:54:47.454
<v Speaker 1>innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because like the mortgage tronches </v>

859
00:54:50.101 --> 00:54:53.790
<v Speaker 1>were very brilliant in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they had unexpected consequences.</v>

860
00:54:53.791 --> 00:54:55.190
<v Speaker 1>But in any case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

861
00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:58.590
<v Speaker 1>there was a protest against the fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

862
00:54:58.950 --> 00:54:59.783
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bulk of the catastrophe seemed to </v>

863
00:55:02.371 --> 00:55:04.980
<v Speaker 1>fall on the poor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is of course always the case,</v>

864
00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:06.233
<v Speaker 1>but there was no organization whatsoever</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the side of the Wall Street Occupy </v>

865
00:55:11.431 --> 00:55:12.590
<v Speaker 1>Wall Street protesters.</v>

866
00:55:12.590 --> 00:55:13.423
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they believed such a wide variety of </v>

867
00:55:14.941 --> 00:55:15.774
<v Speaker 1>things that they are unable to to </v>
<v Speaker 1>organize themselves in any effective </v>

868
00:55:19.021 --> 00:55:21.030
<v Speaker 1>manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And basically as far as I can tell,</v>

869
00:55:21.031 --> 00:55:25.110
<v Speaker 1>all they did was go out and indicate </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they were displeased.</v>

870
00:55:25.530 --> 00:55:30.530
<v Speaker 1>But that's not a very effective strategy</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you're displeased and even if</v>

871
00:55:32.581 --> 00:55:35.100
<v Speaker 1>you're displeased for a reason and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>valid reason,</v>

872
00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:36.353
<v Speaker 1>you still need to have some sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what it would be that would rectify </v>

873
00:55:39.661 --> 00:55:41.310
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because otherwise there's no.</v>

874
00:55:42.150 --> 00:55:46.180
<v Speaker 1>There's no movement forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

875
00:55:46.181 --> 00:55:48.360
<v Speaker 1>so part of the reason I'm doing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>biblical lectures,</v>

876
00:55:48.361 --> 00:55:49.194
<v Speaker 1>which I think are perhaps the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>important thing I'm doing and I hope to </v>

877
00:55:52.321 --> 00:55:53.154
<v Speaker 1>continue because of that is because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to do whatever I can to give those </v>

878
00:55:57.541 --> 00:56:01.740
<v Speaker 1>stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their due credit and to investigate very</v>

879
00:56:01.741 --> 00:56:02.574
<v Speaker 1>thoroughly the manner in which the </v>
<v Speaker 1>literary imagination of Western </v>

880
00:56:06.841 --> 00:56:07.674
<v Speaker 1>civilization that Judeo Christian </v>
<v Speaker 1>tradition manifested itself to produce </v>

881
00:56:12.001 --> 00:56:14.760
<v Speaker 1>the idea of the autonomous invaluable </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>

882
00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:17.100
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that's our magic idea,</v>

883
00:56:17.101 --> 00:56:17.934
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's at the basis of everything that </v>

884
00:56:18.901 --> 00:56:19.734
<v Speaker 1>we do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I guess I'm going to be contributing </v>

885
00:56:22.051 --> 00:56:26.200
<v Speaker 1>to the online university in that manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to try the other,</v>

886
00:56:26.201 --> 00:56:27.034
<v Speaker 1>but I can't promise anything because for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reasons that I already indicated we </v>

887
00:56:31.271 --> 00:56:32.104
<v Speaker 1>were thinking of one tactic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what you guys think about </v>

888
00:56:34.751 --> 00:56:37.960
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was thinking very interesting.</v>

889
00:56:37.961 --> 00:56:38.794
<v Speaker 1>First course might be like a five hour </v>
<v Speaker 1>introduction to the history of the </v>

890
00:56:42.971 --> 00:56:43.804
<v Speaker 1>cosmos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I was talking with my brother in </v>

891
00:56:45.821 --> 00:56:49.090
<v Speaker 1>law who would be willing to fund some of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this along with me.</v>

892
00:56:49.390 --> 00:56:50.223
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe with some crowdfunding we'd </v>

893
00:56:52.181 --> 00:56:55.000
<v Speaker 1>like to host a competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

894
00:56:55.300 --> 00:56:56.133
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the competition would be for the </v>

895
00:56:57.581 --> 00:57:01.720
<v Speaker 1>best five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our summary of the history of the cosmos</v>

896
00:57:01.721 --> 00:57:02.554
<v Speaker 1>from the Big Bang to the present and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>would lay it wide open for people with </v>

897
00:57:07.961 --> 00:57:10.300
<v Speaker 1>regards to what sort of technology they </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to use,</v>

898
00:57:10.301 --> 00:57:13.930
<v Speaker 1>whether it was animation or lecture or </v>
<v Speaker 1>readings or whatever,</v>

899
00:57:14.260 --> 00:57:15.093
<v Speaker 1>and to offer like a $10,000 first prize </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a $5,000 second prize and a $3,000 </v>

900
00:57:20.741 --> 00:57:22.090
<v Speaker 1>third prize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

901
00:57:22.090 --> 00:57:24.700
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe get people to vote on </v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

902
00:57:25.100 --> 00:57:26.830
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

903
00:57:26.831 --> 00:57:29.350
<v Speaker 1>which production was of the highest </v>
<v Speaker 1>quality.</v>

904
00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:30.633
<v Speaker 1>And because what should happen with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>online university I think is that we </v>

905
00:57:34.931 --> 00:57:35.764
<v Speaker 1>should set up a way of funding creative </v>
<v Speaker 1>content producers instead of maybe </v>

906
00:57:40.121 --> 00:57:40.954
<v Speaker 1>focusing on the content itself because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's thousands of people out there </v>

907
00:57:44.201 --> 00:57:46.940
<v Speaker 1>who are very educated and who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps even underemployed,</v>

908
00:57:47.080 --> 00:57:50.710
<v Speaker 1>who have very specific expertise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who could make courses.</v>

909
00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:53.800
<v Speaker 1>And there's just no reason not to </v>
<v Speaker 1>harness that.</v>

910
00:57:54.340 --> 00:57:57.850
<v Speaker 1>And so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've been thinking about it a lot,</v>

911
00:57:58.180 --> 00:58:00.540
<v Speaker 1>but the bottom line is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

912
00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:06.130
<v Speaker 1>how function light am or become over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>next while.</v>

913
00:58:06.170 --> 00:58:07.540
<v Speaker 1>Because I'm certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

914
00:58:07.541 --> 00:58:10.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm only running at about five percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the moment and it's,</v>

915
00:58:10.111 --> 00:58:11.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

916
00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:12.153
<v Speaker 1>it stops me from certainly stops me from</v>
<v Speaker 1>enthusiastic tackling extraordinarily </v>

917
00:58:16.571 --> 00:58:19.240
<v Speaker 1>difficult problems with starting an </v>
<v Speaker 1>online university.</v>

918
00:58:19.810 --> 00:58:24.760
<v Speaker 1>So I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this year has taken a reasonable toll on</v>

919
00:58:24.761 --> 00:58:25.594
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also this dietary sensitivity issue </v>

920
00:58:28.660 --> 00:58:31.930
<v Speaker 1>is</v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated beyond belief.</v>

921
00:58:31.931 --> 00:58:32.764
<v Speaker 1>I can't really go out and eat and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>very difficult to travel and if I eat </v>

922
00:58:35.831 --> 00:58:36.664
<v Speaker 1>the wrong thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm basically in some variant of health </v>

923
00:58:39.831 --> 00:58:41.170
<v Speaker 1>for about a month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

924
00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:44.500
<v Speaker 1>anyhow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll see.</v>

925
00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:46.030
<v Speaker 1>We'll see how that all goes.</v>

926
00:58:52.010 --> 00:58:52.843
<v Speaker 1>What do you make of the manosphere is </v>
<v Speaker 1>claimed that women's liberation has led </v>

927
00:58:55.491 --> 00:58:56.324
<v Speaker 1>to our weakened ability to pair bond,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the breakdown of the institution of </v>

928
00:58:59.421 --> 00:59:03.410
<v Speaker 1>marriage and sexual inequity in favor of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alpha men?</v>

929
00:59:11.420 --> 00:59:12.253
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

930
00:59:13.130 --> 00:59:17.240
<v Speaker 1>I guess probably I would say that to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>degree that all of that is true,</v>

931
00:59:19.300 --> 00:59:20.133
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say that the Women's </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberation movement is what's done it </v>

932
00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:24.193
<v Speaker 1>because I don't believe that the Women's</v>
<v Speaker 1>liberation movement is the primary </v>

933
00:59:26.751 --> 00:59:28.520
<v Speaker 1>driver of Women's liberation.</v>

934
00:59:31.170 --> 00:59:34.920
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a secondary consequences of</v>

935
00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:35.793
<v Speaker 1>far more radical biological revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's the invention of the birth </v>

936
00:59:39.961 --> 00:59:41.840
<v Speaker 1>control pill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

937
00:59:41.850 --> 00:59:42.683
<v Speaker 1>because the birth control pill </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially allowed females for the </v>

938
00:59:46.951 --> 00:59:47.784
<v Speaker 1>first time in evolutionary history to </v>
<v Speaker 1>gain voluntary control over the </v>

939
00:59:50.311 --> 00:59:55.311
<v Speaker 1>reproductive function and a tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of political upheaval followed in</v>

940
00:59:56.461 --> 01:00:00.870
<v Speaker 1>the aftermath of that and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are engaged in that political</v>

941
01:00:00.871 --> 01:00:01.704
<v Speaker 1>upheaval like to think about it as </v>
<v Speaker 1>causal because they like to think that </v>

942
01:00:04.111 --> 01:00:04.944
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their efforts say on agitating in favor </v>

943
01:00:07.801 --> 01:00:08.634
<v Speaker 1>of of women's equal rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was actually the causal factor that </v>

944
01:00:12.451 --> 01:00:14.550
<v Speaker 1>produced the sociological </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation.</v>

945
01:00:14.551 --> 01:00:15.384
<v Speaker 1>But I think the evidence for that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily weak given me </v>

946
01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:21.060
<v Speaker 1>unbelievable magnitude of the birth </v>
<v Speaker 1>control pill.</v>

947
01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:26.520
<v Speaker 1>So with the birth control pill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women become more like men,</v>

948
01:00:27.150 --> 01:00:27.983
<v Speaker 1>much more like man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also it seems to be the case that </v>

949
01:00:31.411 --> 01:00:34.710
<v Speaker 1>women on the birth control pill don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>like masculine men as much.</v>

950
01:00:34.710 --> 01:00:36.840
<v Speaker 1>There's studies showing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

951
01:00:36.841 --> 01:00:37.674
<v Speaker 1>if you show women in the face of it are </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same man at different or the same </v>

952
01:00:42.241 --> 01:00:43.074
<v Speaker 1>men at different phases of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>dilatory cycle and all you do is widen </v>

953
01:00:46.261 --> 01:00:49.350
<v Speaker 1>the Gr,</v>
<v Speaker 1>narrow the job of the men that the women</v>

954
01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:52.680
<v Speaker 1>are at the peak of their observation </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they're maximally fertile like the</v>

955
01:00:52.681 --> 01:00:55.730
<v Speaker 1>wide jaw men better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when they're infertile,</v>

956
01:00:55.740 --> 01:00:58.830
<v Speaker 1>they liked the narrow John mid better </v>
<v Speaker 1>and wider jog.</v>

957
01:00:58.831 --> 01:00:59.664
<v Speaker 1>Men have higher levels of testosterone </v>
<v Speaker 1>and and the pill mimics infertility and </v>

958
01:01:03.751 --> 01:01:06.540
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't know what these radical,</v>

959
01:01:06.570 --> 01:01:07.403
<v Speaker 1>biological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hormonal transformations have done to </v>

960
01:01:09.301 --> 01:01:12.850
<v Speaker 1>the relationship between men and women </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

961
01:01:13.030 --> 01:01:16.500
<v Speaker 1>women too are trying to experiment with </v>
<v Speaker 1>their new mode of being.</v>

962
01:01:16.501 --> 01:01:17.334
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well now they're not destined at an </v>

963
01:01:18.961 --> 01:01:19.794
<v Speaker 1>early age to become,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to transform themselves into mothers or </v>

964
01:01:23.251 --> 01:01:26.010
<v Speaker 1>to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or to allow themselves to be transformed</v>

965
01:01:26.011 --> 01:01:29.520
<v Speaker 1>by nature into mother's even though it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>possible that they might be much happier</v>

966
01:01:29.521 --> 01:01:30.354
<v Speaker 1>if that happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that that's necessarily </v>

967
01:01:33.991 --> 01:01:34.824
<v Speaker 1>the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is good evidence that women's </v>

968
01:01:36.750 --> 01:01:40.500
<v Speaker 1>general level of unhappiness has </v>
<v Speaker 1>increased since the early 19 sixties.</v>

969
01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:41.813
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

970
01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:43.380
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

971
01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:49.760
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what has been the consequences of that?</v>

972
01:01:49.810 --> 01:01:50.643
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first consequence was wild sexual </v>

973
01:01:52.161 --> 01:01:55.910
<v Speaker 1>experimentation and why not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would you expect?</v>

974
01:01:55.911 --> 01:01:58.760
<v Speaker 1>It's like all of a sudden reproductions </v>
<v Speaker 1>under control.</v>

975
01:01:59.170 --> 01:02:02.480
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That women can be as promiscuous as men?</v>

976
01:02:03.290 --> 01:02:05.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's what it means.</v>

977
01:02:05.390 --> 01:02:06.223
<v Speaker 1>We don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was part of the big sixties </v>

978
01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:09.433
<v Speaker 1>experiment and it isn't the obviously </v>
<v Speaker 1>obvious that that went particularly </v>

979
01:02:13.011 --> 01:02:13.844
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

980
01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:14.733
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

981
01:02:15.590 --> 01:02:18.950
<v Speaker 1>it certainly led to the pornography </v>
<v Speaker 1>location of our society,</v>

982
01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:19.793
<v Speaker 1>which I think is been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really think is actually quite </v>

983
01:02:21.331 --> 01:02:22.750
<v Speaker 1>dreadful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

984
01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:24.233
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's my innate prudishness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know what seems to me that </v>

985
01:02:27.930 --> 01:02:31.110
<v Speaker 1>pornography demeans the participants as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well as the viewers.</v>

986
01:02:31.111 --> 01:02:31.944
<v Speaker 1>There's something second rate and </v>
<v Speaker 1>furtive about it and I think that </v>

987
01:02:34.651 --> 01:02:37.570
<v Speaker 1>everybody who engages in it knows that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

988
01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:38.611
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

989
01:02:38.611 --> 01:02:39.444
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

990
01:02:39.530 --> 01:02:42.180
<v Speaker 1>it's an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a substitute for the real adventure</v>

991
01:02:42.181 --> 01:02:43.014
<v Speaker 1>of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I do think that it leads to a </v>

992
01:02:45.541 --> 01:02:48.900
<v Speaker 1>certain kind of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps contempt.</v>

993
01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:52.020
<v Speaker 1>It leads to contempt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>

994
01:02:52.540 --> 01:02:53.630
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

995
01:02:53.830 --> 01:02:55.320
<v Speaker 1>and that can't be a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

996
01:02:55.321 --> 01:02:56.154
<v Speaker 1>I don't ever think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you guys can ask yourself this </v>

997
01:02:58.111 --> 01:03:03.111
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever met anybody who can finish</v>

998
01:03:03.811 --> 01:03:04.644
<v Speaker 1>masturbating and then was proud about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and who stood up straighter because of </v>

999
01:03:08.041 --> 01:03:09.870
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you felt that they'd really conquered</v>

1000
01:03:09.871 --> 01:03:11.670
<v Speaker 1>life as a consequence?</v>

1001
01:03:11.670 --> 01:03:13.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't believe that that's the,</v>

1002
01:03:14.470 --> 01:03:19.470
<v Speaker 1>that that's the general post </v>
<v Speaker 1>masturbation feeling.</v>

1003
01:03:19.620 --> 01:03:21.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that it's,</v>

1004
01:03:22.350 --> 01:03:23.160
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1005
01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:26.090
<v Speaker 1>it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something you do when you,</v>

1006
01:03:26.260 --> 01:03:27.093
<v Speaker 1>when you don't have the right thing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do and it's an admission that you're a </v>

1007
01:03:29.941 --> 01:03:32.910
<v Speaker 1>second player essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>

1008
01:03:33.450 --> 01:03:36.600
<v Speaker 1>So the pornography location was a bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1009
01:03:37.070 --> 01:03:37.903
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that women's lives have been </v>

1010
01:03:43.771 --> 01:03:45.900
<v Speaker 1>complicated too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say buy this,</v>

1011
01:03:45.930 --> 01:03:46.763
<v Speaker 1>buy this transformation to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it isn't easy now for women to </v>

1012
01:03:51.001 --> 01:03:54.990
<v Speaker 1>decide that they want to make being a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother a primary focus of their life.</v>

1013
01:03:54.991 --> 01:03:59.991
<v Speaker 1>Because increasingly it's necessary for </v>
<v Speaker 1>families to have two incomes.</v>

1014
01:04:00.091 --> 01:04:02.340
<v Speaker 1>And I think the reason for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two reasons for that.</v>

1015
01:04:02.341 --> 01:04:03.174
<v Speaker 1>One is that when women started to flood </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the labor market was approximately </v>

1016
01:04:06.991 --> 01:04:07.824
<v Speaker 1>the same time that the market started to</v>
<v Speaker 1>open to places like India and China and </v>

1017
01:04:11.341 --> 01:04:13.350
<v Speaker 1>working wages started to flatten.</v>

1018
01:04:13.710 --> 01:04:14.543
<v Speaker 1>But then you also have the fact that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you doubled the labor pool by </v>

1019
01:04:18.451 --> 01:04:19.284
<v Speaker 1>introducing women into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps you half the value of labor and </v>

1020
01:04:22.050 --> 01:04:23.970
<v Speaker 1>that might maybe do even worse than </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1021
01:04:23.971 --> 01:04:24.804
<v Speaker 1>If women are more agreeable and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>likely to work part time and more </v>

1022
01:04:28.171 --> 01:04:31.470
<v Speaker 1>willing to take lesser hours and lower </v>
<v Speaker 1>pay,</v>

1023
01:04:31.710 --> 01:04:32.543
<v Speaker 1>which seems to be the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then maybe you flatten the labor market </v>

1024
01:04:34.951 --> 01:04:39.951
<v Speaker 1>even more so in terms of increasing </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual inequity in favor of Alpha Man.</v>

1025
01:04:41.820 --> 01:04:42.653
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that Breaks Down Pair Bonding </v>

1026
01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:48.810
<v Speaker 1>matrimony is going to do that because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1027
01:04:49.290 --> 01:04:50.123
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual access for males is a prieto </v>

1028
01:04:52.540 --> 01:04:53.373
<v Speaker 1>distributed phenomena where a small </v>
<v Speaker 1>proportion of the males get most of the </v>

1029
01:04:57.810 --> 01:04:59.170
<v Speaker 1>invitations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

1030
01:04:59.171 --> 01:05:02.130
<v Speaker 1>And the thing that is a bulwark against </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is,</v>

1031
01:05:02.220 --> 01:05:03.053
<v Speaker 1>is monogamy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of the reason that societies </v>

1032
01:05:05.191 --> 01:05:06.024
<v Speaker 1>are set up to be monogamous is so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that proclivity is controlled because </v>

1033
01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:15.060
<v Speaker 1>it's not good for children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say if,</v>

1034
01:05:15.210 --> 01:05:16.043
<v Speaker 1>if they don't have access to a and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not good for women if they're all </v>

1035
01:05:19.451 --> 01:05:20.284
<v Speaker 1>competing for the same man and then it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not good for the men who aren't being </v>

1036
01:05:22.571 --> 01:05:24.790
<v Speaker 1>chosen because they're not being chosen.</v>

1037
01:05:24.850 --> 01:05:29.850
<v Speaker 1>And so that just seems to be a recipe </v>
<v Speaker 1>for resentment and,</v>

1038
01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:33.490
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and aggression.</v>

1039
01:05:33.491 --> 01:05:36.280
<v Speaker 1>And I think the evolutionary psychology </v>
<v Speaker 1>data on that,</v>

1040
01:05:36.281 --> 01:05:38.270
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1041
01:05:40.180 --> 01:05:41.013
<v Speaker 1>that's what I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's the women's </v>

1042
01:05:43.751 --> 01:05:45.630
<v Speaker 1>liberation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the birth control pill.</v>

1043
01:05:45.631 --> 01:05:47.160
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1044
01:05:48.070 --> 01:05:50.980
<v Speaker 1>don't underestimate the significance of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the birth control pill.</v>

1045
01:05:50.981 --> 01:05:53.860
<v Speaker 1>It's like the hydrogen bomb or that or </v>
<v Speaker 1>the computer chip.</v>

1046
01:05:53.861 --> 01:05:58.861
<v Speaker 1>It's a world revolutionary technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for all we know it might do us in,</v>

1047
01:05:59.140 --> 01:06:00.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean in the West,</v>

1048
01:06:00.790 --> 01:06:04.010
<v Speaker 1>the birth rate is far below replacement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1049
01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:07.210
<v Speaker 1>that's as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a multigenerational strategy.</v>

1050
01:06:07.211 --> 01:06:09.160
<v Speaker 1>That's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an absolute dead end.</v>

1051
01:06:09.161 --> 01:06:11.740
<v Speaker 1>And of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one can talk about that because,</v>

1052
01:06:12.310 --> 01:06:13.143
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for obvious the obvious reasons of </v>

1053
01:06:14.591 --> 01:06:17.350
<v Speaker 1>egalitarianism and diversity and all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1054
01:06:17.410 --> 01:06:21.370
<v Speaker 1>but the declining birth rate in the West</v>
<v Speaker 1>is really,</v>

1055
01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:22.653
<v Speaker 1>I would say a catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to be one of those people </v>

1056
01:06:26.641 --> 01:06:28.720
<v Speaker 1>who think the planet has too many people</v>
<v Speaker 1>on it,</v>

1057
01:06:28.721 --> 01:06:29.554
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1058
01:06:33.850 --> 01:06:34.683
<v Speaker 1>you have said that the humanity become </v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupt and for a person to avoid the </v>

1059
01:06:38.921 --> 01:06:43.150
<v Speaker 1>dangers of the postmodern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neo Marxist ideologies and not enroll.</v>

1060
01:06:43.540 --> 01:06:44.373
<v Speaker 1>Would you agree the same applies to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>institute of marriage with laws as they </v>

1061
01:06:47.441 --> 01:06:48.274
<v Speaker 1>are?</v>

1062
01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:54.950
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say that.</v>

1063
01:06:56.900 --> 01:06:59.870
<v Speaker 1>I guess partly because I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand what the alternative is.</v>

1064
01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:00.733
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first I would say that to the degree </v>

1065
01:07:01.911 --> 01:07:02.744
<v Speaker 1>that men are just your unjustly upset </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the way the marriage laws are set </v>

1066
01:07:06.741 --> 01:07:08.900
<v Speaker 1>up and I think they have reason to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned,</v>

1067
01:07:09.380 --> 01:07:10.213
<v Speaker 1>especially with regards to the custody </v>
<v Speaker 1>of children and the probability of </v>

1068
01:07:13.011 --> 01:07:13.844
<v Speaker 1>paying virtually endless alimony with </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably severe penalties for </v>

1069
01:07:18.381 --> 01:07:19.214
<v Speaker 1>failure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that it's incumbent on men to </v>

1070
01:07:21.711 --> 01:07:25.100
<v Speaker 1>organize themselves politically and </v>
<v Speaker 1>rectify that.</v>

1071
01:07:25.101 --> 01:07:27.830
<v Speaker 1>And so I don't think that the answer is </v>
<v Speaker 1>avoiding marriage.</v>

1072
01:07:27.831 --> 01:07:28.664
<v Speaker 1>I think the answer is political </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization and pressure on the right </v>

1073
01:07:31.881 --> 01:07:35.780
<v Speaker 1>institutions to rectify this because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>needs to be rectified.</v>

1074
01:07:36.260 --> 01:07:37.093
<v Speaker 1>And I don't like the idea of telling </v>
<v Speaker 1>young men to avoid permanent </v>

1075
01:07:41.991 --> 01:07:45.320
<v Speaker 1>relationships with women because as far </v>
<v Speaker 1>as I'm concerned,</v>

1076
01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:48.500
<v Speaker 1>this is my traditional wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose manifesting itself.</v>

1077
01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:51.890
<v Speaker 1>There aren't that many pathways to life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1078
01:07:52.340 --> 01:07:54.140
<v Speaker 1>you need a career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need,</v>

1079
01:07:54.610 --> 01:07:57.170
<v Speaker 1>you need an interesting things to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>with your,</v>

1080
01:07:57.440 --> 01:08:01.220
<v Speaker 1>with your time outside of your career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting and meaningful things.</v>

1081
01:08:01.221 --> 01:08:02.054
<v Speaker 1>You need a family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need an intimate relationship to </v>

1082
01:08:04.371 --> 01:08:07.640
<v Speaker 1>twine yourself together with someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>else so that well,</v>

1083
01:08:07.641 --> 01:08:08.474
<v Speaker 1>so that you're protected during times of</v>
<v Speaker 1>crisis and able to celebrate during </v>

1084
01:08:12.411 --> 01:08:14.110
<v Speaker 1>times of joy and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1085
01:08:14.340 --> 01:08:19.340
<v Speaker 1>and so you set up a stable structure so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can have children and have them</v>

1086
01:08:20.001 --> 01:08:25.001
<v Speaker 1>feel secure and unable to play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like that's life man.</v>

1087
01:08:25.130 --> 01:08:25.963
<v Speaker 1>And if you miss any of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then your life is fragmented and </v>

1088
01:08:29.841 --> 01:08:31.400
<v Speaker 1>fractured it and you're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>hurt.</v>

1089
01:08:31.401 --> 01:08:35.420
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not saying that's absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 1>true for every single person.</v>

1090
01:08:35.421 --> 01:08:36.254
<v Speaker 1>There's always exceptions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm concerned with the bulk of </v>

1091
01:08:38.781 --> 01:08:39.614
<v Speaker 1>people and the and what the bulk of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people have already done and like your </v>

1092
01:08:43.941 --> 01:08:46.460
<v Speaker 1>life just isn't in some ways that </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated.</v>

1093
01:08:46.670 --> 01:08:47.503
<v Speaker 1>You need to bear a social weight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to have a family and commit </v>

1094
01:08:51.321 --> 01:08:54.830
<v Speaker 1>yourself to that and it's in those </v>
<v Speaker 1>commitments that you find the meaning in</v>

1095
01:08:54.831 --> 01:08:59.831
<v Speaker 1>your life and so if you don't have them </v>
<v Speaker 1>then while you float and drift and,</v>

1096
01:09:00.650 --> 01:09:01.483
<v Speaker 1>and when people float and drift,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they usually don't float somewhere good </v>

1097
01:09:04.191 --> 01:09:05.024
<v Speaker 1>and they usually drift somewhere bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that there are problems with </v>

1098
01:09:11.061 --> 01:09:14.570
<v Speaker 1>the way the marriage laws are set up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're quite serious.</v>

1099
01:09:14.571 --> 01:09:16.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do think that they</v>

1100
01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:18.793
<v Speaker 1>persecute men often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think the answer to that is </v>

1101
01:09:21.651 --> 01:09:22.484
<v Speaker 1>to tell young men to avoid permanent </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships with young women at all </v>

1102
01:09:26.211 --> 01:09:27.044
<v Speaker 1>costs because that isn't very anti life </v>
<v Speaker 1>doctrine and it's a cure that's worse </v>

1103
01:09:31.401 --> 01:09:34.340
<v Speaker 1>than the disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I would say.</v>

1104
01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:41.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm beginning to sort myself out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks to you.</v>

1105
01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:42.953
<v Speaker 1>While I'm very glad to hear that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a question about scheduling your </v>

1106
01:09:45.661 --> 01:09:46.494
<v Speaker 1>time trying to make a schedule and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaotic job with constantly changing </v>

1107
01:09:51.001 --> 01:09:55.890
<v Speaker 1>shifts and hours tips,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or should I find a new job altogether?</v>

1108
01:09:57.480 --> 01:09:59.550
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1109
01:09:59.850 --> 01:10:00.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1110
01:10:00.590 --> 01:10:01.423
<v Speaker 1>I can't answer that Josh because I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know enough about the details of your </v>

1111
01:10:04.611 --> 01:10:06.380
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I would say,</v>

1112
01:10:06.381 --> 01:10:08.780
<v Speaker 1>and maybe you've tried this already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is you know,</v>

1113
01:10:09.410 --> 01:10:11.390
<v Speaker 1>try to make two plans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1114
01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:12.613
<v Speaker 1>Because when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're trying to think something </v>

1115
01:10:14.031 --> 01:10:16.520
<v Speaker 1>like this through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to think it through in detail.</v>

1116
01:10:17.020 --> 01:10:22.020
<v Speaker 1>And so one plan would be how you would </v>
<v Speaker 1>conduct your life optimally and organize</v>

1117
01:10:22.701 --> 01:10:23.534
<v Speaker 1>your time if you kept your current job </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you want to make that as acceptable </v>

1118
01:10:27.621 --> 01:10:28.454
<v Speaker 1>and positive as possible and then make </v>
<v Speaker 1>out another plan where you shift jobs </v>

1119
01:10:31.971 --> 01:10:32.804
<v Speaker 1>and you have no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a more stable working arrangement </v>

1120
01:10:36.110 --> 01:10:39.380
<v Speaker 1>and then think about what your life </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be like if you had that.</v>

1121
01:10:39.381 --> 01:10:42.440
<v Speaker 1>And then because you've laid out a </v>
<v Speaker 1>detailed map of both,</v>

1122
01:10:42.441 --> 01:10:44.390
<v Speaker 1>you're in a much better position to </v>
<v Speaker 1>compare them.</v>

1123
01:10:45.020 --> 01:10:46.480
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1124
01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:49.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might need to talk to somebody about</v>

1125
01:10:49.611 --> 01:10:50.030
<v Speaker 1>that too.</v>

1126
01:10:50.030 --> 01:10:54.470
<v Speaker 1>But that's what I would recommend </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's just too complicated a job,</v>

1127
01:10:54.471 --> 01:10:55.304
<v Speaker 1>like if you find that your sleep is </v>
<v Speaker 1>chronically disrupted and you can </v>

1128
01:10:58.581 --> 01:11:02.390
<v Speaker 1>organize your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that shift changes,</v>

1129
01:11:02.450 --> 01:11:06.380
<v Speaker 1>no trivial thing and it can really throw</v>
<v Speaker 1>your mood regulation for a loop too.</v>

1130
01:11:06.381 --> 01:11:07.810
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know if that's happening to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1131
01:11:07.850 --> 01:11:08.683
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's also something else that's </v>

1132
01:11:09.531 --> 01:11:14.531
<v Speaker 1>worth taking into consideration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I say map out an alternative reality</v>

1133
01:11:15.781 --> 01:11:19.350
<v Speaker 1>where you don't have those problems and </v>
<v Speaker 1>see how much better that looks,</v>

1134
01:11:19.460 --> 01:11:20.293
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I presume there's some advantages to </v>

1135
01:11:21.601 --> 01:11:22.434
<v Speaker 1>your current job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when it also depends on what your </v>

1136
01:11:24.571 --> 01:11:25.404
<v Speaker 1>options are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how hard would it be for you to </v>

1137
01:11:27.181 --> 01:11:29.280
<v Speaker 1>find another job and couldn't find a </v>
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>

1138
01:11:29.281 --> 01:11:32.640
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe the best thing to do would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>to try to find a job that's better,</v>

1139
01:11:32.850 --> 01:11:35.200
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't have shifts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1140
01:11:35.250 --> 01:11:38.550
<v Speaker 1>and maybe that'll take you a year or two</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can be very difficult,</v>

1141
01:11:38.551 --> 01:11:41.280
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year or two,</v>

1142
01:11:41.850 --> 01:11:44.280
<v Speaker 1>is it a shorter period of time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Often that it seemed.</v>

1143
01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:47.310
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I would recommend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1144
01:11:53.370 --> 01:11:58.140
<v Speaker 1>your idea of realer than real appears to</v>
<v Speaker 1>parallel Plato's theory of the forms.</v>

1145
01:11:58.500 --> 01:12:02.700
<v Speaker 1>Is this the source of the idea or are </v>
<v Speaker 1>you reconceived and ancient philosophy?</v>

1146
01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:04.433
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God only knows what the source of an </v>

1147
01:12:05.581 --> 01:12:06.780
<v Speaker 1>idea is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1148
01:12:06.940 --> 01:12:08.260
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1149
01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:09.533
<v Speaker 1>my sense of plato's forms was it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they weren't exactly narrative </v>

1150
01:12:13.741 --> 01:12:16.440
<v Speaker 1>instructure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I think that I think that there</v>

1151
01:12:16.441 --> 01:12:17.274
<v Speaker 1>isn't at least an analogous relationship</v>
<v Speaker 1>between the idea of archetypes and the </v>

1152
01:12:21.301 --> 01:12:23.190
<v Speaker 1>idea of formed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1153
01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:28.180
<v Speaker 1>I think plato was talking more about </v>
<v Speaker 1>forms of,</v>

1154
01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:30.370
<v Speaker 1>of tangible objects in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1155
01:12:30.390 --> 01:12:34.410
<v Speaker 1>where I'm talking more about permanent </v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns of behavior,</v>

1156
01:12:35.020 --> 01:12:36.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because</v>

1157
01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:40.913
<v Speaker 1>what are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what our culture is essentially is a </v>

1158
01:12:42.541 --> 01:12:46.350
<v Speaker 1>dance of permanent patterns of behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1159
01:12:46.410 --> 01:12:48.250
<v Speaker 1>there's a fair bit of variability in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1160
01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:49.153
<v Speaker 1>in the patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there is variability in a </v>

1161
01:12:51.061 --> 01:12:53.790
<v Speaker 1>basketball game or a soccer game or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

1162
01:12:53.850 --> 01:12:54.683
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's obviously predictability and </v>

1163
01:12:56.041 --> 01:12:57.570
<v Speaker 1>variability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1164
01:12:57.571 --> 01:13:01.200
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the predictable elements are the,</v>

1165
01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:04.320
<v Speaker 1>or equivalent in some sense to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>platonic forms,</v>

1166
01:13:04.321 --> 01:13:05.154
<v Speaker 1>which is the point that you're making.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's the discovery of those more </v>

1167
01:13:08.970 --> 01:13:13.970
<v Speaker 1>permanent forms that emerges as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of the spinning of stories,</v>

1168
01:13:16.351 --> 01:13:17.184
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're watching each other </v>

1169
01:13:18.061 --> 01:13:18.894
<v Speaker 1>constantly and we're articulating what </v>
<v Speaker 1>we see and then we're amalgamating the </v>

1170
01:13:22.861 --> 01:13:25.590
<v Speaker 1>articulations and we're sifting them </v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

1171
01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:28.800
<v Speaker 1>for fundamental patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like a good example of that.</v>

1172
01:13:28.940 --> 01:13:29.773
<v Speaker 1>It's something that I just recently </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovered when I did the biblical </v>

1173
01:13:31.531 --> 01:13:33.660
<v Speaker 1>lectures on Abraham.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1174
01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:38.100
<v Speaker 1>I didn't understand that Abraham was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>late bloomer.</v>

1175
01:13:38.100 --> 01:13:38.933
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was like the guy who stayed in his </v>

1176
01:13:40.021 --> 01:13:41.700
<v Speaker 1>mother's basement for too long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1177
01:13:41.970 --> 01:13:45.660
<v Speaker 1>he's 75 when God calls him on an </v>
<v Speaker 1>adventure.</v>

1178
01:13:45.661 --> 01:13:50.661
<v Speaker 1>And God basically tells him to leave his</v>
<v Speaker 1>family and his countrymen in his kinsmen</v>

1179
01:13:51.031 --> 01:13:54.270
<v Speaker 1>and to go into the land of the stranger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's.</v>

1180
01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:58.680
<v Speaker 1>See there's an archetypal pattern there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the pattern is,</v>

1181
01:13:58.740 --> 01:13:59.573
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the pattern of the call and it's </v>

1182
01:14:03.180 --> 01:14:05.790
<v Speaker 1>deeply,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something that people experienced,</v>

1183
01:14:05.791 --> 01:14:07.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an adolescent,</v>

1184
01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:08.473
<v Speaker 1>healthy adolescent wants to get away </v>
<v Speaker 1>from his or her stultifying a dependent </v>

1185
01:14:16.601 --> 01:14:19.540
<v Speaker 1>upbringing and go out into the world of </v>
<v Speaker 1>adventure.</v>

1186
01:14:19.541 --> 01:14:22.690
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the biblical stories that's,</v>

1187
01:14:22.870 --> 01:14:27.870
<v Speaker 1>that's symbolically represented as </v>
<v Speaker 1>something akin to a divine call,</v>

1188
01:14:28.511 --> 01:14:29.344
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is quite interesting </v>

1189
01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:34.630
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't understand these calls,</v>

1190
01:14:34.631 --> 01:14:36.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have an impulse to do something.</v>

1191
01:14:36.401 --> 01:14:37.960
<v Speaker 1>Something captures your interest.</v>

1192
01:14:37.990 --> 01:14:39.790
<v Speaker 1>Something captures your motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1193
01:14:39.890 --> 01:14:42.190
<v Speaker 1>it's not like it's self generated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1194
01:14:42.790 --> 01:14:44.560
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1195
01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:45.433
<v Speaker 1>the idea that the call to adventure is </v>
<v Speaker 1>produced by something like a </v>

1196
01:14:48.311 --> 01:14:51.340
<v Speaker 1>transcendent deity is a really </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting idea.</v>

1197
01:14:51.370 --> 01:14:53.000
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depends on what you mean by data.</v>

1198
01:14:53.001 --> 01:14:53.834
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can think about it as an ancient </v>

1199
01:14:54.911 --> 01:14:56.350
<v Speaker 1>brain circuit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose,</v>

1200
01:14:56.351 --> 01:14:58.960
<v Speaker 1>although I don't know if that really </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes it things any clearer,</v>

1201
01:14:59.380 --> 01:15:04.330
<v Speaker 1>but there is an impulse within people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that pulls them out into the world to go</v>

1202
01:15:04.331 --> 01:15:05.164
<v Speaker 1>away from their safe circumstances and </v>
<v Speaker 1>to make their fortunate where there's </v>

1203
01:15:08.891 --> 01:15:09.724
<v Speaker 1>famine and tyranny and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and threats to the integrity of the </v>

1204
01:15:12.431 --> 01:15:13.264
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are all things that Abraham </v>

1205
01:15:14.171 --> 01:15:16.360
<v Speaker 1>immediately encounters when he listens </v>
<v Speaker 1>to God.</v>

1206
01:15:16.990 --> 01:15:17.823
<v Speaker 1>And so that seems to be something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's realer than real </v>

1207
01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:22.833
<v Speaker 1>because everyone experiences that to </v>
<v Speaker 1>some degree or everyone can relate to </v>

1208
01:15:26.141 --> 01:15:26.974
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a deep,</v>

1209
01:15:27.010 --> 01:15:27.843
<v Speaker 1>deep theme and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm looking for in the biblical </v>

1210
01:15:31.931 --> 01:15:34.990
<v Speaker 1>stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in other mythological representations is</v>

1211
01:15:34.991 --> 01:15:35.824
<v Speaker 1>these deep universal themes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now is that a reconceptualization of </v>

1212
01:15:40.451 --> 01:15:43.360
<v Speaker 1>ancient philosophy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard to say because,</v>

1213
01:15:43.570 --> 01:15:45.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I derived the idea of the archetype,</v>

1214
01:15:45.550 --> 01:15:46.383
<v Speaker 1>at least in part from reading new and </v>
<v Speaker 1>young of course was influenced because </v>

1215
01:15:50.291 --> 01:15:52.660
<v Speaker 1>he had a great classical education by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ancients.</v>

1216
01:15:52.661 --> 01:15:55.690
<v Speaker 1>And so exactly where these ideas come </v>
<v Speaker 1>from isn't clear.</v>

1217
01:15:56.170 --> 01:15:57.003
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1218
01:15:58.540 --> 01:16:02.920
<v Speaker 1>so I guess that's pretty much all I have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to say about that.</v>

1219
01:16:19.980 --> 01:16:22.350
<v Speaker 1>Nothing motivates me aside from eating </v>
<v Speaker 1>and sleeping.</v>

1220
01:16:22.351 --> 01:16:24.930
<v Speaker 1>I lie in my bed all day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one on my computer,</v>

1221
01:16:24.931 --> 01:16:26.550
<v Speaker 1>not on my phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not doing anything.</v>

1222
01:16:26.551 --> 01:16:29.160
<v Speaker 1>I just lie there thinking what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening to me.</v>

1223
01:16:29.940 --> 01:16:34.230
<v Speaker 1>I would say that you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is not a diagnostic comment and</v>

1224
01:16:34.231 --> 01:16:36.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't know enough about you to provide</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of information,</v>

1225
01:16:36.841 --> 01:16:41.841
<v Speaker 1>but I would recommend that you see a </v>
<v Speaker 1>therapist and be screened for depression</v>

1226
01:16:42.301 --> 01:16:46.470
<v Speaker 1>because that's what it looks like to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say that if it's depression,</v>

1227
01:16:46.471 --> 01:16:49.800
<v Speaker 1>you should do something about it because</v>
<v Speaker 1>depression is very hard on people.</v>

1228
01:16:49.801 --> 01:16:50.634
<v Speaker 1>It produces a lot of stress hormones </v>
<v Speaker 1>like cortisol and that can hurt you in </v>

1229
01:16:54.540 --> 01:16:54.961
<v Speaker 1>May,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1230
01:16:54.961 --> 01:16:57.270
<v Speaker 1>if it's only been a couple of days I </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't worry about it.</v>

1231
01:16:57.271 --> 01:17:00.450
<v Speaker 1>But if it's a chronic pattern then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should go talk to somebody,</v>

1232
01:17:00.451 --> 01:17:02.030
<v Speaker 1>even your family doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1233
01:17:02.031 --> 01:17:06.000
<v Speaker 1>and there's always the possibility that </v>
<v Speaker 1>a low dose of an antidepressant might be</v>

1234
01:17:06.001 --> 01:17:07.180
<v Speaker 1>worth trying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1235
01:17:07.190 --> 01:17:08.490
<v Speaker 1>in a month if it fixed you.</v>

1236
01:17:08.490 --> 01:17:11.510
<v Speaker 1>But I would say don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't stay in that situation,</v>

1237
01:17:11.511 --> 01:17:12.650
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go,</v>

1238
01:17:12.710 --> 01:17:15.320
<v Speaker 1>go find out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do whatever you have to do to get out of</v>

1239
01:17:15.321 --> 01:17:16.154
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And especially the fact that you're not </v>

1240
01:17:17.451 --> 01:17:19.880
<v Speaker 1>on your computer and no one on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>phone not doing anything,</v>

1241
01:17:19.910 --> 01:17:20.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1242
01:17:20.570 --> 01:17:21.403
<v Speaker 1>you're ruminating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just lying there thinking that's </v>

1243
01:17:23.570 --> 01:17:27.020
<v Speaker 1>loops of negative emotion and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have any positive emotion,</v>

1244
01:17:27.021 --> 01:17:27.854
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why you're not on your computer </v>

1245
01:17:28.941 --> 01:17:29.774
<v Speaker 1>or your phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the characteristics of </v>

1246
01:17:32.181 --> 01:17:33.014
<v Speaker 1>depression or I suppose to have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>characteristics is a decrease in </v>

1247
01:17:35.451 --> 01:17:36.284
<v Speaker 1>positive motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that means that you're not </v>

1248
01:17:38.061 --> 01:17:38.894
<v Speaker 1>interested in anything and an increase </v>
<v Speaker 1>in negative emotion and that can </v>

1249
01:17:41.451 --> 01:17:45.140
<v Speaker 1>manifest itself in that I'm just lying </v>
<v Speaker 1>there thinking,</v>

1250
01:17:45.170 --> 01:17:48.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so go talk to someone,</v>

1251
01:17:49.010 --> 01:17:51.650
<v Speaker 1>go talk to someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell someone that this is happening,</v>

1252
01:17:51.890 --> 01:17:54.770
<v Speaker 1>gift to your family doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let them know what's happening,</v>

1253
01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:57.950
<v Speaker 1>get them to give you a depression </v>
<v Speaker 1>screening and uh,</v>

1254
01:17:58.270 --> 01:17:59.103
<v Speaker 1>and see what you can do about it because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are effective treatments for </v>

1255
01:18:02.390 --> 01:18:03.223
<v Speaker 1>depression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes antidepressants work like </v>

1256
01:18:04.791 --> 01:18:06.680
<v Speaker 1>a absolute charm</v>

1257
01:18:10.100 --> 01:18:13.460
<v Speaker 1>to tap into the dopaminergic system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You said you needed to value goal.</v>

1258
01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:15.650
<v Speaker 1>Is there any way to tap into the opioid </v>
<v Speaker 1>system?</v>

1259
01:18:16.250 --> 01:18:19.790
<v Speaker 1>I want to be more connected to people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but part of me can't get myself to care.</v>

1260
01:18:20.570 --> 01:18:21.141
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1261
01:18:21.141 --> 01:18:21.974
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so maybe you're a little bit on the </v>

1262
01:18:23.961 --> 01:18:25.940
<v Speaker 1>disagreeable side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a possibility.</v>

1263
01:18:26.270 --> 01:18:27.103
<v Speaker 1>There's some interesting clinical </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence that suggests that one of the </v>

1264
01:18:30.530 --> 01:18:31.363
<v Speaker 1>things that disagreeable people can do </v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to facilitate their </v>

1265
01:18:35.060 --> 01:18:37.880
<v Speaker 1>interactions with other people is to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>people favors.</v>

1266
01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:42.560
<v Speaker 1>And so what you might say is that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could start by acting like you care.</v>

1267
01:18:43.130 --> 01:18:46.400
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe you could learn how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>care through doing that,</v>

1268
01:18:46.401 --> 01:18:47.234
<v Speaker 1>so maybe you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I'm going to do something nice for </v>

1269
01:18:49.221 --> 01:18:52.480
<v Speaker 1>someone once every two days for a month </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1270
01:18:52.620 --> 01:18:54.770
<v Speaker 1>and think about it a little bit and see </v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1271
01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:57.680
<v Speaker 1>see if that changes you because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1272
01:18:57.681 --> 01:18:58.514
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you think yourself into change</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes you act yourself into </v>

1273
01:19:01.761 --> 01:19:02.594
<v Speaker 1>changing your thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what I would start by </v>

1274
01:19:06.141 --> 01:19:08.210
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1275
01:19:09.020 --> 01:19:14.020
<v Speaker 1>you could also be more connected to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people regardless of whether you care,</v>

1276
01:19:14.121 --> 01:19:14.954
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say that it would take you six </v>

1277
01:19:16.071 --> 01:19:20.150
<v Speaker 1>months of practice or even a year of </v>
<v Speaker 1>practice before you cared.</v>

1278
01:19:20.870 --> 01:19:23.030
<v Speaker 1>But that's not so long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're young.</v>

1279
01:19:23.540 --> 01:19:24.373
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1280
01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:27.580
<v Speaker 1>that's what I say about that.</v>

1281
01:19:39.260 --> 01:19:43.130
<v Speaker 1>Do we know if Dr Peterson has just been </v>
<v Speaker 1>overrun by his emails?</v>

1282
01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:44.233
<v Speaker 1>I thought he would find meaningful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people are telling me it's unlikely </v>

1283
01:19:46.671 --> 01:19:47.780
<v Speaker 1>to leave and see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1284
01:19:47.781 --> 01:19:48.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I guess,</v>

1285
01:19:49.490 --> 01:19:52.550
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I'm so overwhelmed by my email that</v>

1286
01:19:52.850 --> 01:19:55.130
<v Speaker 1>it's just unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1287
01:19:55.590 --> 01:19:56.423
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably have 10,000 emails that are </v>

1288
01:19:58.341 --> 01:20:01.310
<v Speaker 1>unanswered and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at some point I just,</v>

1289
01:20:02.420 --> 01:20:05.450
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say exactly that I gave up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's close enough,</v>

1290
01:20:05.890 --> 01:20:06.723
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to respond to the ones that </v>

1291
01:20:07.981 --> 01:20:10.620
<v Speaker 1>will destroy my life if I don't respond </v>
<v Speaker 1>to them,</v>

1292
01:20:10.650 --> 01:20:13.450
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's really sad because um,</v>

1293
01:20:13.830 --> 01:20:17.010
<v Speaker 1>people are sending me really good </v>
<v Speaker 1>letters and I've been trying to think of</v>

1294
01:20:17.011 --> 01:20:17.844
<v Speaker 1>a method of having someone go through my</v>
<v Speaker 1>email to identify the letters that are </v>

1295
01:20:22.740 --> 01:20:23.573
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably help,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heartfelt and valuable because it's a </v>

1296
01:20:26.071 --> 01:20:27.780
<v Speaker 1>shame to miss them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1297
01:20:28.010 --> 01:20:31.110
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just haven't had any choice,</v>

1298
01:20:31.510 --> 01:20:32.343
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically except when I'm not feeling </v>

1299
01:20:34.681 --> 01:20:34.920
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

1300
01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:35.461
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1301
01:20:35.461 --> 01:20:40.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm basically working from seven in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>morning til 11 at night trying to finish</v>

1302
01:20:40.171 --> 01:20:42.660
<v Speaker 1>my book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I have to page proofs for now.</v>

1303
01:20:42.661 --> 01:20:47.550
<v Speaker 1>So that's getting closer to keep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to keep up with my obligations,</v>

1304
01:20:48.030 --> 01:20:48.863
<v Speaker 1>including making the videos and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>preparing the biblical lectures and </v>

1305
01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:57.560
<v Speaker 1>trying to zip here and there and talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm very sorry that to all of you.</v>

1306
01:21:00.331 --> 01:21:01.164
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that many of you have written </v>
<v Speaker 1>me letters and that you've put a lot of </v>

1307
01:21:03.631 --> 01:21:05.950
<v Speaker 1>heart and soul into them and thanking </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

1308
01:21:05.951 --> 01:21:08.110
<v Speaker 1>You were describing a problem that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have or,</v>

1309
01:21:08.230 --> 01:21:13.230
<v Speaker 1>or a solution that you've generated or </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas and I really feel bad that I can't</v>

1310
01:21:13.381 --> 01:21:14.730
<v Speaker 1>answer them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can't.</v>

1311
01:21:14.731 --> 01:21:16.920
<v Speaker 1>So at some point you just think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1312
01:21:16.921 --> 01:21:18.450
<v Speaker 1>that's just how it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1313
01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:19.313
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't do what you can do when </v>

1314
01:21:21.151 --> 01:21:24.450
<v Speaker 1>there's no sense being overwhelmingly </v>
<v Speaker 1>tormented by it.</v>

1315
01:21:24.451 --> 01:21:25.540
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1316
01:21:26.070 --> 01:21:27.510
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the situation.</v>

1317
01:21:27.511 --> 01:21:30.090
<v Speaker 1>So please don't take it personally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1318
01:21:57.950 --> 01:21:58.783
<v Speaker 1>Dr Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am considering going into the </v>

1319
01:22:00.141 --> 01:22:00.974
<v Speaker 1>education stream slash system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have any advice for me not to </v>

1320
01:22:05.121 --> 01:22:07.880
<v Speaker 1>become a mouthpiece for indoctrinating </v>
<v Speaker 1>young students?</v>

1321
01:22:09.470 --> 01:22:10.303
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing I would recommend is that you </v>

1322
01:22:13.461 --> 01:22:15.770
<v Speaker 1>don't write essays that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in.</v>

1323
01:22:16.910 --> 01:22:17.743
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a sin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a sin to use your words </v>

1324
01:22:21.390 --> 01:22:23.060
<v Speaker 1>falsely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that,</v>

1325
01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:27.110
<v Speaker 1>like there's a good series of social </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology experiments that show,</v>

1326
01:22:27.111 --> 01:22:27.944
<v Speaker 1>like imagine that you bring someone into</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lab and you have them write an essay </v>

1327
01:22:31.611 --> 01:22:34.940
<v Speaker 1>about or fill out a questionnaire about </v>
<v Speaker 1>their political opinions,</v>

1328
01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:35.793
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you get a baseline measure of their </v>

1329
01:22:37.071 --> 01:22:40.520
<v Speaker 1>political stance and then you ask them </v>
<v Speaker 1>to write a thousand words,</v>

1330
01:22:40.550 --> 01:22:41.383
<v Speaker 1>maybe they identify as right wing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you get them to write a </v>

1331
01:22:44.420 --> 01:22:48.140
<v Speaker 1>thousand word essay on why a particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>left wing position is true.</v>

1332
01:22:48.710 --> 01:22:49.543
<v Speaker 1>And then you have them come back in two </v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks and you give them the same </v>

1333
01:22:52.011 --> 01:22:52.844
<v Speaker 1>political belief questionnaire they'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell have shifted quite radically </v>

1334
01:22:55.881 --> 01:22:56.930
<v Speaker 1>towards the left.</v>

1335
01:22:57.350 --> 01:22:58.183
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't think through their positions in </v>

1336
01:23:01.431 --> 01:23:02.264
<v Speaker 1>great detail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you get them to think through </v>

1337
01:23:04.990 --> 01:23:05.823
<v Speaker 1>a contrary position in great detail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that starts to become more </v>

1338
01:23:08.741 --> 01:23:09.574
<v Speaker 1>convincing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you go into a field like </v>

1339
01:23:11.501 --> 01:23:12.820
<v Speaker 1>education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really,</v>

1340
01:23:13.130 --> 01:23:17.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm pathologically overrun by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>postmodern,</v>

1341
01:23:17.591 --> 01:23:18.424
<v Speaker 1>neo Marxist types.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to experience a tremendous </v>

1342
01:23:21.071 --> 01:23:23.110
<v Speaker 1>amount of pressure to falsify your </v>
<v Speaker 1>words.</v>

1343
01:23:23.111 --> 01:23:24.940
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be afraid that if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do that,</v>

1344
01:23:24.941 --> 01:23:29.941
<v Speaker 1>you're going to fail and maybe sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will be punished by a professor,</v>

1345
01:23:29.981 --> 01:23:30.814
<v Speaker 1>but I would say in most circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still optimistic enough to believe </v>

1346
01:23:33.671 --> 01:23:37.480
<v Speaker 1>that if you write a good essay that </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't ideologically proper,</v>

1347
01:23:37.481 --> 01:23:38.314
<v Speaker 1>you'll still get a good grade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I would say if you write a good </v>

1348
01:23:40.691 --> 01:23:43.750
<v Speaker 1>essay that's not ideologically proper </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you do get a good grade,</v>

1349
01:23:43.751 --> 01:23:45.610
<v Speaker 1>that's probably a good time to fight.</v>

1350
01:23:46.510 --> 01:23:48.910
<v Speaker 1>So because you either fight or </v>
<v Speaker 1>capitulate,</v>

1351
01:23:48.911 --> 01:23:49.744
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1352
01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:52.480
<v Speaker 1>that's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the hard truth.</v>

1353
01:23:52.481 --> 01:23:53.314
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not saying it would be easy and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>would also say don't make unnecessary </v>

1354
01:23:58.181 --> 01:23:59.014
<v Speaker 1>enemies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1355
01:23:59.020 --> 01:24:01.000
<v Speaker 1>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything doesn't have to be a battle,</v>

1356
01:24:01.001 --> 01:24:03.460
<v Speaker 1>but now and then you're going to know </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you know,</v>

1357
01:24:03.461 --> 01:24:07.450
<v Speaker 1>you'll hate writing the essay because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to sacrifice your soul in order</v>

1358
01:24:07.451 --> 01:24:10.120
<v Speaker 1>to put the words down and then you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1359
01:24:10.230 --> 01:24:14.470
<v Speaker 1>you demand to warp your character and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you just don't recover easily from that.</v>

1360
01:24:14.471 --> 01:24:16.420
<v Speaker 1>So I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do that,</v>

1361
01:24:16.421 --> 01:24:17.770
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not good.</v>

1362
01:24:26.170 --> 01:24:27.003
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever dressed professor Kevin?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mcdonald's work on an ethnic conflict </v>

1363
01:24:29.831 --> 01:24:32.620
<v Speaker 1>theory of Judaism as a group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary strategy,</v>

1364
01:24:32.621 --> 01:24:35.800
<v Speaker 1>visa vi gentile societies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very provocative,</v>

1365
01:24:35.801 --> 01:24:39.190
<v Speaker 1>but I find much of it persuasive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you read any of his work?</v>

1366
01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:42.070
<v Speaker 1>This is going to be a very disappointing</v>
<v Speaker 1>answer.</v>

1367
01:24:42.071 --> 01:24:46.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid because the answer is no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't read any of his work,</v>

1368
01:24:46.361 --> 01:24:51.140
<v Speaker 1>so I'm afraid I'm not going to be able </v>
<v Speaker 1>to answer that question unfortunately,</v>

1369
01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:52.990
<v Speaker 1>so apologies for that.</v>

1370
01:24:59.830 --> 01:25:00.663
<v Speaker 1>I've definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've recently developed a nasty case of </v>

1371
01:25:02.291 --> 01:25:05.470
<v Speaker 1>hypno phobia and generally suffer from </v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety surrounding sleep.</v>

1372
01:25:05.471 --> 01:25:07.840
<v Speaker 1>It's become a significant negative force</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my life,</v>

1373
01:25:07.870 --> 01:25:08.703
<v Speaker 1>cause unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm rather well put together and </v>

1374
01:25:10.421 --> 01:25:13.060
<v Speaker 1>successful across many domains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any advice?</v>

1375
01:25:13.300 --> 01:25:15.370
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to bed later.</v>

1376
01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:17.073
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that happens to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people when they're having a hard time </v>

1377
01:25:19.811 --> 01:25:21.730
<v Speaker 1>going to sleep and their sleep is </v>
<v Speaker 1>disrupted,</v>

1378
01:25:21.731 --> 01:25:22.564
<v Speaker 1>is that they tend to go to bed earlier </v>
<v Speaker 1>to catch up on their sleep and that </v>

1379
01:25:25.271 --> 01:25:26.104
<v Speaker 1>actually has a counter that's cut that </v>
<v Speaker 1>works at counter purposes to what </v>

1380
01:25:30.581 --> 01:25:31.414
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to attempt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you want to do is delay your sleep </v>

1381
01:25:34.301 --> 01:25:37.060
<v Speaker 1>until you're really quite tired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So stay up much later.</v>

1382
01:25:37.061 --> 01:25:38.830
<v Speaker 1>Get up at the same time in the morning </v>
<v Speaker 1>game,</v>

1383
01:25:38.831 --> 01:25:39.664
<v Speaker 1>but move your sleep time later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe half an hour night until you </v>

1384
01:25:42.911 --> 01:25:44.780
<v Speaker 1>actually do fall asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1385
01:25:45.070 --> 01:25:49.450
<v Speaker 1>the other thing that you could look into</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that there are relaxation exercises.</v>

1386
01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:50.553
<v Speaker 1>Behavior therapists offer those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm sure you could find one online </v>

1387
01:25:53.001 --> 01:25:53.834
<v Speaker 1>and breathing exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so often what you do is imagine </v>

1388
01:25:56.561 --> 01:25:57.394
<v Speaker 1>you're laying in your bed and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>nervous and so what you do is you </v>

1389
01:26:00.161 --> 01:26:00.994
<v Speaker 1>concentrate on your feet and you flex </v>
<v Speaker 1>your and then breathe in and out and </v>

1390
01:26:05.361 --> 01:26:06.194
<v Speaker 1>relax them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you flex your ankles or the </v>

1391
01:26:08.271 --> 01:26:09.104
<v Speaker 1>soles of your feet and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and breathe in and out and relax and do </v>

1392
01:26:12.831 --> 01:26:13.664
<v Speaker 1>that with every muscle group all the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>up your body and remember to breathe </v>

1393
01:26:17.181 --> 01:26:20.270
<v Speaker 1>deeply and regularly and that can help </v>
<v Speaker 1>regulate your anxiety.</v>

1394
01:26:20.330 --> 01:26:24.590
<v Speaker 1>So I would say stay up later till you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly tired.</v>

1395
01:26:25.460 --> 01:26:27.950
<v Speaker 1>The other thing you might try and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sleeping in a different room.</v>

1396
01:26:29.570 --> 01:26:30.403
<v Speaker 1>And then the final thing is there aren't</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty effective sleep medications like </v>

1397
01:26:34.290 --> 01:26:37.520
<v Speaker 1>Zappos for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just seems to be pretty effective.</v>

1398
01:26:37.521 --> 01:26:39.770
<v Speaker 1>And if you're really having a hard time </v>
<v Speaker 1>sleeping,</v>

1399
01:26:39.771 --> 01:26:44.150
<v Speaker 1>maybe you could try something like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and see if it and see if it helps.</v>

1400
01:26:44.151 --> 01:26:44.984
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to try it forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But so the simplest thing to do though </v>

1401
01:26:48.171 --> 01:26:49.004
<v Speaker 1>is to go to bed later and because you'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>be more tired and more likely to fall </v>

1402
01:26:51.771 --> 01:26:52.604
<v Speaker 1>asleep then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's really not going to cause you </v>

1403
01:26:53.871 --> 01:26:56.240
<v Speaker 1>any trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I recommend.</v>

1404
01:27:15.230 --> 01:27:19.370
<v Speaker 1>What do we do once our ego has helped us</v>
<v Speaker 1>plan the dominance hierarchy to secure a</v>

1405
01:27:19.380 --> 01:27:20.213
<v Speaker 1>mate?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why then should we keep looking for a </v>

1406
01:27:21.621 --> 01:27:25.040
<v Speaker 1>mate and how to curtail that instinct?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1407
01:27:25.041 --> 01:27:28.670
<v Speaker 1>I think part of the way that you curtail</v>
<v Speaker 1>that in state is that you have,</v>

1408
01:27:29.390 --> 01:27:31.700
<v Speaker 1>you have this sort of life that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have with a mate.</v>

1409
01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:35.460
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the purpose of pair bonding?</v>

1410
01:27:35.461 --> 01:27:38.180
<v Speaker 1>And one of the fundamental purposes of </v>
<v Speaker 1>pair bonding,</v>

1411
01:27:38.210 --> 01:27:38.961
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a couple.</v>

1412
01:27:38.961 --> 01:27:39.794
<v Speaker 1>One is that it solves the sexual access </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems so that you don't have to </v>

1413
01:27:43.220 --> 01:27:47.320
<v Speaker 1>continue to obsess about who you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be within and,</v>

1414
01:27:47.430 --> 01:27:48.390
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1415
01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:50.120
<v Speaker 1>and where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how.</v>

1416
01:27:50.450 --> 01:27:52.670
<v Speaker 1>And so you can get on with other </v>
<v Speaker 1>elements of your life,</v>

1417
01:27:52.671 --> 01:27:54.650
<v Speaker 1>but I mean with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with your meat,</v>

1418
01:27:54.651 --> 01:27:55.484
<v Speaker 1>you have to decide what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does it mean that you're now </v>

1419
01:27:56.811 --> 01:27:58.370
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1420
01:27:58.371 --> 01:27:59.720
<v Speaker 1>what year it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>companionship.</v>

1421
01:27:59.740 --> 01:28:02.690
<v Speaker 1>Obviously in friendship and their shared</v>
<v Speaker 1>interests,</v>

1422
01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:03.553
<v Speaker 1>you have to decide what they are and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>would say that you should continue </v>

1423
01:28:05.811 --> 01:28:06.644
<v Speaker 1>dating your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your partner at least once a week or </v>

1424
01:28:09.201 --> 01:28:12.500
<v Speaker 1>perhaps twice a week because otherwise </v>
<v Speaker 1>the romance goes out of your life.</v>

1425
01:28:12.860 --> 01:28:13.693
<v Speaker 1>But then also you have to decide about </v>
<v Speaker 1>children and and eventually about </v>

1426
01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:20.180
<v Speaker 1>grandchildren because you know you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to get them old and new.</v>

1427
01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:21.153
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get older and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>mature and children are a huge part of </v>

1428
01:28:23.811 --> 01:28:27.260
<v Speaker 1>life and they get a bad rap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is really unfortunate because,</v>

1429
01:28:27.590 --> 01:28:30.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'm different in this regard.</v>

1430
01:28:30.620 --> 01:28:31.453
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps I am to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I never regretted having kids for </v>

1431
01:28:34.041 --> 01:28:36.920
<v Speaker 1>even one second because there are so </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean.</v>

1432
01:28:37.640 --> 01:28:40.940
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden you have an intimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with new people.</v>

1433
01:28:40.941 --> 01:28:43.820
<v Speaker 1>That is as close as any relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you've ever had.</v>

1434
01:28:44.060 --> 01:28:48.110
<v Speaker 1>You have the opportunity to make that </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship as pristine as you possibly</v>

1435
01:28:48.111 --> 01:28:49.040
<v Speaker 1>can mean.</v>

1436
01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:51.140
<v Speaker 1>It can be a lot of catastrophe involved </v>
<v Speaker 1>in it,</v>

1437
01:28:51.470 --> 01:28:52.303
<v Speaker 1>but it's a great opportunity and there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>just nothing wrong with having some </v>

1438
01:28:54.981 --> 01:28:56.830
<v Speaker 1>additional people that love you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1439
01:28:57.260 --> 01:28:58.093
<v Speaker 1>and so what you do is you turn your </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to the issues of maturity and </v>

1440
01:29:02.970 --> 01:29:03.803
<v Speaker 1>your junior year attention away from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>issues of being a juvenile and you do </v>

1441
01:29:07.321 --> 01:29:10.890
<v Speaker 1>that partly by knowing that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually better to do so.</v>

1442
01:29:11.240 --> 01:29:14.520
<v Speaker 1>You know there's nothing more absurd </v>
<v Speaker 1>than the 40 year old 20 year old.</v>

1443
01:29:15.110 --> 01:29:15.943
<v Speaker 1>It gets ugly and there's something like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something like spoiled milk </v>

1444
01:29:19.261 --> 01:29:20.094
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It goes off and you have to gracefully </v>

1445
01:29:23.401 --> 01:29:24.234
<v Speaker 1>accept the challenges of each stage of </v>
<v Speaker 1>life and things work a lot better when </v>

1446
01:29:27.991 --> 01:29:30.840
<v Speaker 1>you do that much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much better and you also have to,</v>

1447
01:29:31.130 --> 01:29:31.963
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>work on and perfect your sex life with </v>

1448
01:29:34.471 --> 01:29:35.304
<v Speaker 1>your partner and express what you need </v>
<v Speaker 1>and want and teach each other what's </v>

1449
01:29:38.731 --> 01:29:42.510
<v Speaker 1>necessary to keep things exciting and </v>
<v Speaker 1>and and new.</v>

1450
01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:44.273
<v Speaker 1>It's not an easy thing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's very much worthwhile because </v>

1451
01:29:46.831 --> 01:29:47.664
<v Speaker 1>then you can combine sexual excitement </v>
<v Speaker 1>with intimacy and there's no better </v>

1452
01:29:51.121 --> 01:29:53.070
<v Speaker 1>combination than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1453
01:29:53.640 --> 01:29:54.473
<v Speaker 1>and love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can all be nested inside love and </v>

1454
01:29:56.420 --> 01:29:59.430
<v Speaker 1>inside in our destiny that's intertwined</v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

1455
01:29:59.790 --> 01:30:01.260
<v Speaker 1>That's the best you've got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1456
01:30:01.261 --> 01:30:01.950
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1457
01:30:01.950 --> 01:30:04.050
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what life has to offer.</v>

1458
01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:06.340
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1459
01:30:06.810 --> 01:30:10.890
<v Speaker 1>that's what you do is you accept the </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility of the next stage of life</v>

1460
01:30:10.891 --> 01:30:11.724
<v Speaker 1>and you don't mourn the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose that also means that when </v>

1461
01:30:14.881 --> 01:30:15.714
<v Speaker 1>you're young you do what young people do</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that you don't want to do it </v>

1462
01:30:17.821 --> 01:30:19.260
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1463
01:30:33.670 --> 01:30:37.210
<v Speaker 1>I need to ask a very serious question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pickles are green olives.</v>

1464
01:30:37.950 --> 01:30:39.190
<v Speaker 1>Hm?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a tough one.</v>

1465
01:30:39.920 --> 01:30:43.510
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the moment I can't eat pickles so I'd</v>

1466
01:30:43.511 --> 01:30:45.920
<v Speaker 1>have to go with green all upside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you really like green olives?</v>

1467
01:30:45.950 --> 01:30:48.880
<v Speaker 1>Especially if they're spicy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'd probably,</v>

1468
01:30:49.060 --> 01:30:51.160
<v Speaker 1>if I had to make a choice it would be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tough one,</v>

1469
01:30:51.161 --> 01:30:53.140
<v Speaker 1>but I think I'd probably go with green </v>
<v Speaker 1>olives.</v>

1470
01:30:53.770 --> 01:30:54.603
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1471
01:31:08.560 --> 01:31:10.890
<v Speaker 1>do you have any advice for someone who </v>
<v Speaker 1>may be asexual?</v>

1472
01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:14.800
<v Speaker 1>I want to have a husband and children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm 27 and haven't felt a connection</v>

1473
01:31:14.801 --> 01:31:15.634
<v Speaker 1>with anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just seeing everyone as friends so </v>

1474
01:31:17.441 --> 01:31:20.890
<v Speaker 1>far in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1475
01:31:20.891 --> 01:31:23.590
<v Speaker 1>he might want to see a sex therapist </v>
<v Speaker 1>that might help.</v>

1476
01:31:23.830 --> 01:31:24.663
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess the other thing I would say as </v>

1477
01:31:26.381 --> 01:31:27.280
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1478
01:31:27.370 --> 01:31:30.920
<v Speaker 1>it might not be too bad an idea to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1479
01:31:31.690 --> 01:31:35.860
<v Speaker 1>act out what you want perhaps in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>absence of any necessary desire.</v>

1480
01:31:35.861 --> 01:31:36.390
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1481
01:31:36.390 --> 01:31:39.430
<v Speaker 1>you might be so far have fallen so far </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside yourself.</v>

1482
01:31:39.431 --> 01:31:41.510
<v Speaker 1>Then it's very difficult to get out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1483
01:31:42.760 --> 01:31:45.030
<v Speaker 1>what are sex therapist would do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be in,</v>

1484
01:31:45.110 --> 01:31:46.720
<v Speaker 1>once you were in some kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

1485
01:31:46.721 --> 01:31:47.554
<v Speaker 1>friendship that you wanted to move </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward would be to have you guys </v>

1486
01:31:51.731 --> 01:31:55.210
<v Speaker 1>practice interacting in an intimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>manner,</v>

1487
01:31:55.211 --> 01:31:57.910
<v Speaker 1>stage by stage so that you could get </v>
<v Speaker 1>accustomed to it,</v>

1488
01:31:57.911 --> 01:31:58.744
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you need to explore whether that's </v>

1489
01:32:01.690 --> 01:32:05.050
<v Speaker 1>essential reality as you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or if it's fear or if it's,</v>

1490
01:32:05.470 --> 01:32:06.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be fear of rejection,</v>

1491
01:32:06.881 --> 01:32:07.714
<v Speaker 1>it might be fear of sexuality might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're slow to warm up and </v>

1492
01:32:10.780 --> 01:32:11.613
<v Speaker 1>introverted.</v>

1493
01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:15.580
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think seeing a sex therapist might</v>

1494
01:32:15.581 --> 01:32:20.581
<v Speaker 1>not be a bad idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1495
01:32:22.841 --> 01:32:25.420
<v Speaker 1>I guess the other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I say this with some hesitation,</v>

1496
01:32:25.421 --> 01:32:28.720
<v Speaker 1>is that if you find someone you like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you could be friends with,</v>

1497
01:32:28.721 --> 01:32:29.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could try.</v>

1498
01:32:30.250 --> 01:32:31.083
<v Speaker 1>I'm initiating a romantic relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>and practice it for a couple of months </v>

1499
01:32:34.661 --> 01:32:36.190
<v Speaker 1>and see what happens because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1500
01:32:36.191 --> 01:32:38.560
<v Speaker 1>maybe you'd warm up across time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly,</v>

1501
01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:41.980
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly a possibility.</v>

1502
01:32:42.490 --> 01:32:43.323
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have systemic juvenile idiopathic </v>

1503
01:32:54.051 --> 01:32:54.884
<v Speaker 1>arthritis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you mentioned your daughter has </v>

1504
01:32:55.821 --> 01:32:58.370
<v Speaker 1>something akin to it in a diet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Helped him with her fatigue.</v>

1505
01:32:58.670 --> 01:33:03.670
<v Speaker 1>May I ask what diet she used cheers from</v>
<v Speaker 1>Calgary if you go to,</v>

1506
01:33:04.690 --> 01:33:08.360
<v Speaker 1>if you look up mckayla Peterson don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>eat that,</v>

1507
01:33:08.570 --> 01:33:10.820
<v Speaker 1>that's her blog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't eat that.</v>

1508
01:33:11.420 --> 01:33:15.590
<v Speaker 1>And she has a lot of advice there about </v>
<v Speaker 1>diets that you could try and,</v>

1509
01:33:15.860 --> 01:33:17.870
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1510
01:33:17.871 --> 01:33:20.440
<v Speaker 1>I would say do it with some hesitation </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Catia,</v>

1511
01:33:20.460 --> 01:33:22.280
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1512
01:33:24.190 --> 01:33:27.850
<v Speaker 1>that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seemed to help her a lot.</v>

1513
01:33:28.450 --> 01:33:32.410
<v Speaker 1>So do you plan your day much or your </v>
<v Speaker 1>time generally?</v>

1514
01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:34.360
<v Speaker 1>Does this lead to higher productivity?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1515
01:33:34.361 --> 01:33:35.194
<v Speaker 1>I plan my day obsessively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My calendar is always absolutely full </v>

1516
01:33:38.081 --> 01:33:41.470
<v Speaker 1>and often weeks in advance and I plan in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the morning,</v>

1517
01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:43.480
<v Speaker 1>especially when I'm on top of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1518
01:33:44.020 --> 01:33:49.020
<v Speaker 1>And I plan each hour and I probably plan</v>
<v Speaker 1>each minute and yes,</v>

1519
01:33:49.961 --> 01:33:52.130
<v Speaker 1>it leads to way higher productivity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

1520
01:33:52.780 --> 01:33:54.940
<v Speaker 1>you decide what your goals are going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>

1521
01:33:54.970 --> 01:33:55.803
<v Speaker 1>You place them in the calendar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>use the calendar as your friend day </v>

1522
01:33:58.480 --> 01:34:01.600
<v Speaker 1>because what you want to do with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>calendar is designed a day that you want</v>

1523
01:34:01.601 --> 01:34:05.260
<v Speaker 1>to have or a day that would be good for </v>
<v Speaker 1>you in a day that would be good for you,</v>

1524
01:34:05.261 --> 01:34:07.750
<v Speaker 1>is one that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're,</v>

1525
01:34:07.751 --> 01:34:09.430
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1526
01:34:09.431 --> 01:34:12.380
<v Speaker 1>when you end the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel that you've moved,</v>

1527
01:34:12.790 --> 01:34:15.190
<v Speaker 1>moved yourself ahead towards your </v>
<v Speaker 1>values,</v>

1528
01:34:15.220 --> 01:34:16.053
<v Speaker 1>goals and that you've kept chaos under </v>
<v Speaker 1>control and that enables you to sleep </v>

1529
01:34:20.530 --> 01:34:22.300
<v Speaker 1>soundly and with a good conscience.</v>

1530
01:34:22.300 --> 01:34:25.690
<v Speaker 1>And to know that the next day is going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be at least not worse than that.</v>

1531
01:34:25.691 --> 01:34:28.240
<v Speaker 1>Date.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Planning is unbelievably useful.</v>

1532
01:34:28.241 --> 01:34:29.410
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1533
01:34:29.580 --> 01:34:30.413
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to sound like a broken </v>

1534
01:34:31.271 --> 01:34:33.520
<v Speaker 1>record with regards to the future </v>
<v Speaker 1>authoring program,</v>

1535
01:34:33.521 --> 01:34:35.080
<v Speaker 1>but it really is useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1536
01:34:35.470 --> 01:34:38.290
<v Speaker 1>you need to figure out what it is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're aiming at and why.</v>

1537
01:34:38.291 --> 01:34:42.070
<v Speaker 1>And then you need to figure out how </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to break that down over the</v>

1538
01:34:42.070 --> 01:34:42.903
<v Speaker 1>months and the weeks and the days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I would approach your calendar like </v>

1539
01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:46.720
<v Speaker 1>it's your best friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think,</v>

1540
01:34:46.721 --> 01:34:47.554
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to design a weak man that I </v>

1541
01:34:49.091 --> 01:34:49.924
<v Speaker 1>really want to have and that means you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can schedule in leisure and all the </v>

1542
01:34:52.661 --> 01:34:54.310
<v Speaker 1>things that you want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would,</v>

1543
01:34:54.311 --> 01:34:57.800
<v Speaker 1>you absolutely should do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's also quite to,</v>

1544
01:34:58.050 --> 01:34:58.883
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give yourself minimal time to do </v>

1545
01:35:01.701 --> 01:35:02.534
<v Speaker 1>something complicated because it's quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>challenging to see if you can do far </v>

1546
01:35:05.781 --> 01:35:08.030
<v Speaker 1>more than you thought in far less time.</v>

1547
01:35:08.570 --> 01:35:11.210
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a fun game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing you can do is like,</v>

1548
01:35:11.211 --> 01:35:15.170
<v Speaker 1>if you're avoiding something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could schedule in five minutes of it</v>

1549
01:35:15.171 --> 01:35:15.621
<v Speaker 1>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1550
01:35:15.621 --> 01:35:18.710
<v Speaker 1>like if you're avoiding looking at some </v>
<v Speaker 1>bills because you're afraid of them,</v>

1551
01:35:18.711 --> 01:35:19.544
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your first step might be to schedule in </v>

1552
01:35:21.771 --> 01:35:23.900
<v Speaker 1>five minutes where you just look at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bill,</v>

1553
01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:24.913
<v Speaker 1>you don't do anything else and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might be able to entice yourself </v>

1554
01:35:27.381 --> 01:35:28.490
<v Speaker 1>into doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1555
01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:29.953
<v Speaker 1>but I would say learning to plan is </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably useful to schedule your </v>

1556
01:35:34.071 --> 01:35:35.630
<v Speaker 1>time because that's your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1557
01:35:36.210 --> 01:35:38.450
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but scheduled the life you want,</v>

1558
01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:41.960
<v Speaker 1>that means you have to schedule your </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibilities often,</v>

1559
01:35:42.030 --> 01:35:42.863
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because responsibilities are those </v>

1560
01:35:45.051 --> 01:35:47.420
<v Speaker 1>things that ruin your life if you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>fulfill them.</v>

1561
01:35:47.421 --> 01:35:48.420
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1562
01:35:49.350 --> 01:35:51.950
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>safety advisor,</v>

1563
01:35:51.951 --> 01:35:54.590
<v Speaker 1>northern Alberta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>asking what's the best personality tests</v>

1564
01:35:54.591 --> 01:35:56.810
<v Speaker 1>for my coworker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ground level of management.</v>

1565
01:35:56.811 --> 01:36:00.440
<v Speaker 1>Any recommended practices to promote </v>
<v Speaker 1>mental health with remote workers?</v>

1566
01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:04.780
<v Speaker 1>Well answered the first part of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>using big five personality test.</v>

1567
01:36:05.340 --> 01:36:10.160
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what my camera just like trucks.</v>

1568
01:36:53.380 --> 01:36:55.240
<v Speaker 1>Sorry about that guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm back.</v>

1569
01:36:57.190 --> 01:36:58.930
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully everything is functioning </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

1570
01:37:20.580 --> 01:37:21.413
<v Speaker 1>Question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is capitalism compatible with your </v>

1571
01:37:23.101 --> 01:37:23.934
<v Speaker 1>definition of good?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it requires ever increasing uses of </v>

1572
01:37:26.581 --> 01:37:30.690
<v Speaker 1>the finite resources of the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where once depleted would mean our end.</v>

1573
01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:31.793
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say capitalism isn't compatible </v>

1574
01:37:33.841 --> 01:37:34.674
<v Speaker 1>with my definition of good if it </v>
<v Speaker 1>requires every increasing uses of the </v>

1575
01:37:37.681 --> 01:37:41.940
<v Speaker 1>finite resources of the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's by no means self evident even</v>

1576
01:37:41.941 --> 01:37:44.220
<v Speaker 1>though the Scuttlebutt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

1577
01:37:44.221 --> 01:37:45.054
<v Speaker 1>especially among the environmentalist </v>
<v Speaker 1>oriented types who might have some </v>

1578
01:37:48.691 --> 01:37:49.980
<v Speaker 1>sympathy for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

1579
01:37:49.981 --> 01:37:52.050
<v Speaker 1>especially with regards to ocean </v>
<v Speaker 1>depletion.</v>

1580
01:37:52.510 --> 01:37:53.343
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a huge argument and there has </v>

1581
01:37:54.511 --> 01:37:55.344
<v Speaker 1>been for many years between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>economists and the biologists and this </v>

1582
01:37:57.871 --> 01:37:58.704
<v Speaker 1>is a really important thing to know and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the economists point out that human </v>

1583
01:38:01.861 --> 01:38:05.880
<v Speaker 1>ingenuity is such that we're continually</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to make more with less.</v>

1584
01:38:05.881 --> 01:38:09.840
<v Speaker 1>And certainly over the last well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>500 years,</v>

1585
01:38:10.940 --> 01:38:14.400
<v Speaker 1>especially in the last 150 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just absolutely evident.</v>

1586
01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:15.233
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people say we're going to run out </v>

1587
01:38:16.531 --> 01:38:17.364
<v Speaker 1>of energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's absolutely </v>

1588
01:38:18.151 --> 01:38:18.984
<v Speaker 1>preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's just crazy as thinking </v>

1589
01:38:20.701 --> 01:38:22.770
<v Speaker 1>we're going to run out of mattered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1590
01:38:22.890 --> 01:38:23.723
<v Speaker 1>we're going through a bit of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottleneck right now because you know </v>

1591
01:38:26.130 --> 01:38:26.963
<v Speaker 1>the population is going to increase to </v>
<v Speaker 1>about 9 billion and then it's gonna </v>

1592
01:38:29.370 --> 01:38:30.930
<v Speaker 1>decrease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1593
01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:35.310
<v Speaker 1>that's the most reliable projections and</v>
<v Speaker 1>$9 million isn't a lot more than we have</v>

1594
01:38:35.311 --> 01:38:36.144
<v Speaker 1>now and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's gonna be some environmental </v>

1595
01:38:39.001 --> 01:38:39.834
<v Speaker 1>disruption as a consequence of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think there's any reason to </v>

1596
01:38:42.451 --> 01:38:43.284
<v Speaker 1>assume that all that capitalism </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily requires every increasing </v>

1597
01:38:46.501 --> 01:38:48.750
<v Speaker 1>uses of the finite resources of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet.</v>

1598
01:38:49.110 --> 01:38:49.943
<v Speaker 1>It's also not obvious to what degree the</v>
<v Speaker 1>resources of the planet are actually </v>

1599
01:38:52.501 --> 01:38:53.334
<v Speaker 1>finite because we continually think up </v>
<v Speaker 1>new uses for things that nobody thought </v>

1600
01:38:58.381 --> 01:38:59.214
<v Speaker 1>had any use at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it depends to some degree on </v>

1601
01:39:02.281 --> 01:39:07.281
<v Speaker 1>whether or not you're willing to bet on </v>
<v Speaker 1>human imaginativeness or you're going to</v>

1602
01:39:07.681 --> 01:39:08.514
<v Speaker 1>be a male.</v>

1603
01:39:08.710 --> 01:39:09.543
<v Speaker 1>A pessimist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not saying that there are </v>

1604
01:39:11.350 --> 01:39:12.183
<v Speaker 1>reasons for both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying that it is by no means </v>

1605
01:39:14.461 --> 01:39:16.470
<v Speaker 1>self evident that things are getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>

1606
01:39:16.980 --> 01:39:19.470
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I can give you an example.</v>

1607
01:39:19.471 --> 01:39:20.340
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1608
01:39:20.820 --> 01:39:23.880
<v Speaker 1>in the last,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the last 15 years,</v>

1609
01:39:24.690 --> 01:39:25.523
<v Speaker 1>the millennium goal for the UN was to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have world poverty like absolute </v>

1610
01:39:28.231 --> 01:39:30.570
<v Speaker 1>poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's less than a dollar 50 a day by</v>

1611
01:39:30.571 --> 01:39:31.404
<v Speaker 1>50 percent within 15 years and that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually reached ahead of schedule and </v>

1612
01:39:35.790 --> 01:39:36.623
<v Speaker 1>we've lived in hundreds of millions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people into the middle class over the </v>

1613
01:39:38.941 --> 01:39:42.330
<v Speaker 1>last 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there is an increasing inequality</v>

1614
01:39:42.331 --> 01:39:43.164
<v Speaker 1>in the west because the working class </v>
<v Speaker 1>taken the brunt of that say that </v>

1615
01:39:46.951 --> 01:39:50.040
<v Speaker 1>redistribution to third world countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But by the same token,</v>

1616
01:39:50.041 --> 01:39:50.874
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no starvation in the world </v>

1617
01:39:52.171 --> 01:39:55.530
<v Speaker 1>anymore except really for reasons of </v>
<v Speaker 1>misdistribution and,</v>

1618
01:39:55.940 --> 01:39:56.773
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1619
01:39:56.910 --> 01:39:58.260
<v Speaker 1>and political purpose.</v>

1620
01:39:58.560 --> 01:40:01.830
<v Speaker 1>And people are becoming richer and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>educated all the time.</v>

1621
01:40:01.860 --> 01:40:06.000
<v Speaker 1>And we are waking up to our planet to </v>
<v Speaker 1>your responsibilities.</v>

1622
01:40:06.030 --> 01:40:10.180
<v Speaker 1>Once people stopped starving to death </v>
<v Speaker 1>and having to burn like dirt and,</v>

1623
01:40:10.410 --> 01:40:11.570
<v Speaker 1>and eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1624
01:40:11.610 --> 01:40:14.370
<v Speaker 1>substandard food that they've scraped </v>
<v Speaker 1>out at the Brown.</v>

1625
01:40:14.700 --> 01:40:18.060
<v Speaker 1>They do start to turn their attention to</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that might be more aesthetic.</v>

1626
01:40:18.061 --> 01:40:18.894
<v Speaker 1>And so look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's any reason to be </v>

1627
01:40:20.281 --> 01:40:22.440
<v Speaker 1>pessimistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Fundamentally.</v>

1628
01:40:23.100 --> 01:40:23.933
<v Speaker 1>And I guess the reason that capitalism </v>
<v Speaker 1>is compatible with my definition of </v>

1629
01:40:27.190 --> 01:40:28.950
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say that exactly.</v>

1630
01:40:28.951 --> 01:40:29.784
<v Speaker 1>I would say that I don't see an </v>
<v Speaker 1>alternative that has manifested itself </v>

1631
01:40:33.780 --> 01:40:36.810
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't have far more negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>

1632
01:40:37.220 --> 01:40:39.480
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of a minimal pessimism issue.</v>

1633
01:40:39.481 --> 01:40:42.480
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well this is the best devil that we have</v>

1634
01:40:42.990 --> 01:40:46.830
<v Speaker 1>and I do believe it is because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful societies,</v>

1635
01:40:46.831 --> 01:40:47.664
<v Speaker 1>by any stretch of the imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by virtually any metric are the </v>

1636
01:40:51.870 --> 01:40:54.010
<v Speaker 1>capitalist societies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certainly the case,</v>

1637
01:40:54.011 --> 01:40:54.844
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the Soviet Union demolished far </v>

1638
01:40:57.161 --> 01:41:02.161
<v Speaker 1>more of its natural resources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Too Far less productive consequence than</v>

1639
01:41:02.621 --> 01:41:03.454
<v Speaker 1>the west did hearsay evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's suggestions that between 10 and </v>

1640
01:41:06.401 --> 01:41:07.234
<v Speaker 1>15 percent of the total area of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Soviet Union has been rendered more or </v>

1641
01:41:10.181 --> 01:41:14.620
<v Speaker 1>less permanently uninhabitable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the question is compared to what?</v>

1642
01:41:17.250 --> 01:41:19.950
<v Speaker 1>All right guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's late</v>

1643
01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:25.270
<v Speaker 1>and by the answered lots of questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's 10:20.</v>

1644
01:41:25.990 --> 01:41:29.080
<v Speaker 1>So a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jordan,</v>

1645
01:41:29.081 --> 01:41:30.880
<v Speaker 1>hope you're doing well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Says I am.</v>

1646
01:41:30.881 --> 01:41:34.240
<v Speaker 1>Who Am glad to see you live?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad to see me alive too.</v>

1647
01:41:34.490 --> 01:41:37.150
<v Speaker 1>That's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And hopefully that will continue.</v>

1648
01:41:37.720 --> 01:41:38.553
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1649
01:41:39.400 --> 01:41:40.233
<v Speaker 1>anyways guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you very much for attending to </v>

1650
01:41:43.631 --> 01:41:44.560
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once again,</v>

1651
01:41:45.550 --> 01:41:46.383
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm always gratified by the response to </v>

1652
01:41:47.861 --> 01:41:52.300
<v Speaker 1>these q and a's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fun to see what your questions are,</v>

1653
01:41:52.301 --> 01:41:52.770
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>

1654
01:41:52.770 --> 01:41:54.680
<v Speaker 1>they'd been really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were really difficult tonight.</v>

1655
01:41:54.681 --> 01:41:55.514
<v Speaker 1>Then I'm very impressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean some of them I was afraid to </v>

1656
01:41:57.521 --> 01:42:01.960
<v Speaker 1>answer and so if you didn't get your </v>
<v Speaker 1>question answered and it was up near the</v>

1657
01:42:02.260 --> 01:42:03.093
<v Speaker 1>top of the vote last,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then part of the reason I didn't answer </v>

1658
01:42:06.821 --> 01:42:07.654
<v Speaker 1>it is because I was actually afraid I </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be able to generate something </v>

1659
01:42:09.641 --> 01:42:14.080
<v Speaker 1>intelligent enough on the fly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

1660
01:42:14.890 --> 01:42:16.920
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks very much and uh,</v>

1661
01:42:17.080 --> 01:42:20.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to start the biblical lectures</v>
<v Speaker 1>again in October and I've got some other</v>

1662
01:42:20.951 --> 01:42:24.250
<v Speaker 1>videos to release if I can get myself </v>
<v Speaker 1>organized to,</v>

1663
01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:29.400
<v Speaker 1>to edit them and put them up and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll see you in a month.</v>

1664
01:42:29.890 --> 01:42:33.010
<v Speaker 1>So thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks very much.</v>

1665
01:42:33.110 --> 01:42:33.943
<v Speaker 1>Good night.</v>
