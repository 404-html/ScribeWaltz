WEBVTT

1
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:03.750
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.160
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to show you guys,</v>

3
00:00:05.161 --> 00:00:05.994
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4
00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:08.800
<v Speaker 1>totally relevant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone here.</v>

5
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.380
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for future offering,</v>

6
00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.680
<v Speaker 1>can we still send it to Christine </v>
<v Speaker 1>because she's not here?</v>

7
00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.740
<v Speaker 2>I can't ask her that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Assuming the best.</v>

8
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.280
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

9
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.540
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we should send it,</v>

10
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.113
<v Speaker 2>I will as soon as I find out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I suspect that things will go on as </v>

11
00:00:32.381 --> 00:00:35.530
<v Speaker 2>normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So just do what we've been doing.</v>

12
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:39.690
<v Speaker 2>That's the theory</v>

13
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.680
<v Speaker 1>factors yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

14
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

15
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think she is.</v>

16
00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.003
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

17
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.433
<v Speaker 1>Can you be on strike you like shame on </v>
<v Speaker 1>you for being straight cause you're not </v>

18
00:01:01.241 --> 00:01:02.320
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just feel like,</v>

19
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.290
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just wondering,</v>

20
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.540
<v Speaker 1>could you be on strike if you're pointed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to another?</v>

21
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.320
<v Speaker 2>Well they're near on a virtual strike.</v>

22
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.060
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that office.</v>

23
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.310
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I'll,</v>

24
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:27.633
<v Speaker 2>should we sign all the stupid things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't send her the damn essays and </v>

25
00:01:30.721 --> 00:01:32.940
<v Speaker 2>we'll see what happens or in the future </v>
<v Speaker 2>or three stuff.</v>

26
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.670
<v Speaker 2>Eventually they're going to get graded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they don't,</v>

27
00:01:35.671 --> 00:01:38.730
<v Speaker 2>I will figure out what to do about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to be left hanging with</v>

28
00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:40.110
<v Speaker 2>this course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

29
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.480
<v Speaker 2>so just do the word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do the work.</v>

30
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.690
<v Speaker 2>We'll figure out how you get your damn </v>
<v Speaker 2>credit.</v>

31
00:01:45.691 --> 00:01:46.524
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do everything I can so that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not left hanging because I don't </v>

32
00:01:49.591 --> 00:01:51.380
<v Speaker 2>think that's reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

33
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.090
<v Speaker 2>did the beef isn't with you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

34
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.490
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so don't worry about it for now.</v>

35
00:01:56.491 --> 00:01:59.580
<v Speaker 2>Just proceed as if everything will be </v>
<v Speaker 2>worked out.</v>

36
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.710
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

37
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:02.693
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I want to show you some images and </v>

38
00:02:04.411 --> 00:02:06.450
<v Speaker 2>these are great farther images </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally.</v>

39
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.313
<v Speaker 2>And I want you to take a look at them </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're powerful propaganda </v>

40
00:02:10.141 --> 00:02:12.150
<v Speaker 2>images and we want to see what they </v>
<v Speaker 2>represent.</v>

41
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.450
<v Speaker 2>So on the right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see Hitler there?</v>

42
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.610
<v Speaker 2>Who's taking over from,</v>

43
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.650
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

44
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.870
<v Speaker 2>Hindenburg I believe that's right.</v>

45
00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:23.403
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

46
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.080
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was the president before Hitler came,</v>

47
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.920
<v Speaker 2>came aboard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you see that there's the transfer</v>

48
00:02:30.921 --> 00:02:34.700
<v Speaker 2>of power from the wise old man to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the emergent hero.</v>

49
00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.250
<v Speaker 2>That's the image on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

50
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.580
<v Speaker 2>And so then on the right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

51
00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.100
<v Speaker 2>so what do you think about that picture?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does it represent?</v>

52
00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.370
<v Speaker 2>What's going on there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>

53
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll just look at,</v>

54
00:02:53.361 --> 00:02:54.500
<v Speaker 2>just look at the image.</v>

55
00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.570
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the balance of representing</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big order,</v>

56
00:02:58.571 --> 00:03:02.380
<v Speaker 1>the balance between tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>MMM</v>

57
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.120
<v Speaker 2>turney and security,</v>
<v Speaker 2>security.</v>

58
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.660
<v Speaker 2>It's the balance be doing all the Cyrus </v>
<v Speaker 2>and horace,</v>

59
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:12.880
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's different than that.</v>

60
00:03:12.881 --> 00:03:14.560
<v Speaker 2>That's close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

61
00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:19.561
<v Speaker 2>it's a call to heroism from the youth </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the father who's far seeing and you</v>

62
00:03:21.191 --> 00:03:22.024
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>composed serving as the protector and </v>

63
00:03:24.731 --> 00:03:25.564
<v Speaker 2>the model.</v>

64
00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.173
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

65
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.950
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's your sort of ideal area in youth.</v>

66
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's an interesting picture,</v>

67
00:03:35.581 --> 00:03:36.414
<v Speaker 2>a because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's actually a picture that represents </v>

68
00:03:39.721 --> 00:03:43.230
<v Speaker 2>a child in a way that you very seldom </v>
<v Speaker 2>see children represented.</v>

69
00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:44.623
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the child is very serious and </v>

70
00:03:45.691 --> 00:03:46.524
<v Speaker 2>determined and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not an acceptable image of a </v>

71
00:03:49.441 --> 00:03:50.274
<v Speaker 2>child.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Generally speaking in a culture that's </v>

72
00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:53.173
<v Speaker 2>optimistic and naive because the kids </v>
<v Speaker 2>are always like their little innocent </v>

73
00:03:55.711 --> 00:03:58.470
<v Speaker 2>things that have no power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that's wrong.</v>

74
00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:02.520
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>

75
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:03.301
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>

76
00:04:03.301 --> 00:04:06.720
<v Speaker 2>He's a great father.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the all seeing great farther in the</v>

77
00:04:06.721 --> 00:04:07.554
<v Speaker 2>background.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like the wizard of Oz </v>

78
00:04:08.401 --> 00:04:09.480
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

79
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.070
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

80
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these partly order,</v>

81
00:04:13.621 --> 00:04:16.830
<v Speaker 2>and that was a huge part of Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's partly was attractive because</v>

82
00:04:16.831 --> 00:04:17.664
<v Speaker 2>Germany was absolutely in chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that made order more and more </v>

83
00:04:21.451 --> 00:04:22.470
<v Speaker 2>attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

84
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.750
<v Speaker 2>So when Hitler was a very orderly </v>
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>

85
00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:26.303
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

86
00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.790
<v Speaker 2>and so what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would that be the case?</v>

87
00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.090
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

88
00:04:37.091 --> 00:04:39.490
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that means they're above you.</v>

89
00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.980
<v Speaker 2>You're looking up at an ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

90
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.440
<v Speaker 2>And that's because they're in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominance hierarchy.</v>

91
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.840
<v Speaker 2>You're kneeling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's another way of thinking about it.</v>

92
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.200
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are also lift from above.</v>

93
00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.193
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's far seeing right there looking </v>

94
00:04:57.001 --> 00:04:59.490
<v Speaker 2>far ahead into the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

95
00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.740
<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

96
00:05:01.741 --> 00:05:05.160
<v Speaker 2>So then there's the picture on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what do you think about that?</v>

97
00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:07.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

98
00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.880
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

99
00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:08.713
<v Speaker 2>maybe I can make it a little bit bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you have is Hitler on the right of </v>

100
00:05:12.231 --> 00:05:15.980
<v Speaker 2>the picture in the left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then a huge number of people crowded</v>

101
00:05:15.981 --> 00:05:19.760
<v Speaker 2>around him and they're all smiling and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and joyful.</v>

102
00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:25.190
<v Speaker 2>And so that's a representation of Hitler</v>
<v Speaker 2>as the jovial farther of the race.</v>

103
00:05:25.191 --> 00:05:26.840
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you'll see it set at a,</v>

104
00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.660
<v Speaker 2>at a table.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what do people do at a table?</v>

105
00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:31.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

106
00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.580
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they share it.</v>

107
00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.010
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's a very familial,</v>

108
00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.670
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a very familial enterprise.</v>

109
00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.270
<v Speaker 2>And to share food with someone is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>bring them into your house.</v>

110
00:05:42.271 --> 00:05:43.104
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to be the distributor of food is to </v>

111
00:05:44.611 --> 00:05:47.370
<v Speaker 2>be the benevolent father.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then on the right,</v>

112
00:05:47.371 --> 00:05:49.710
<v Speaker 2>you see Hitler addressing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

113
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.920
<v Speaker 2>I large political crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

114
00:05:52.921 --> 00:05:55.740
<v Speaker 2>he's up on a high platform with his men </v>
<v Speaker 2>behind him,</v>

115
00:05:55.741 --> 00:05:56.574
<v Speaker 2>and then these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these eagles carrying the swastika sort </v>

116
00:05:58.911 --> 00:06:01.340
<v Speaker 2>of arrayed behind him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's up again.</v>

117
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:02.773
<v Speaker 2>So very good at theatrically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Nazis were very good at using </v>

118
00:06:06.531 --> 00:06:07.364
<v Speaker 2>theatrical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

119
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:13.450
<v Speaker 2>So then you see him on the left there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think about that picture?</v>

120
00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's Stoic and resolute,</v>

121
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.830
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

122
00:06:18.831 --> 00:06:20.060
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

123
00:06:20.061 --> 00:06:24.680
<v Speaker 2>And then you have the middle picture </v>
<v Speaker 2>where the Germans are basically marching</v>

124
00:06:24.681 --> 00:06:27.890
<v Speaker 2>with what are really remade Roman </v>
<v Speaker 2>banners,</v>

125
00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.440
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what do you,</v>

126
00:06:30.441 --> 00:06:32.690
<v Speaker 2>what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does that image show</v>

127
00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:35.793
<v Speaker 1>very?</v>

128
00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:37.650
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly right.</v>

129
00:06:37.651 --> 00:06:38.484
<v Speaker 2>It shows uniformity and solidarity and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the uniformity comes out because </v>

130
00:06:42.541 --> 00:06:44.550
<v Speaker 2>everyone's the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

131
00:06:44.551 --> 00:06:47.370
<v Speaker 2>And that makes them a powerful united </v>
<v Speaker 2>force.</v>

132
00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:50.070
<v Speaker 2>Now you might ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

133
00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:53.760
<v Speaker 2>why would people want that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what's the answer to that</v>

134
00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:58.830
<v Speaker 2>and power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

135
00:06:58.831 --> 00:06:59.664
<v Speaker 2>you want to be part of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a powerful united force or do you </v>

136
00:07:03.901 --> 00:07:08.010
<v Speaker 2>want to be like the weak member of an if</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely fragmented society,</v>

137
00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now you might say,</v>

138
00:07:11.281 --> 00:07:15.000
<v Speaker 2>well I don't want to be too integrated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

139
00:07:15.001 --> 00:07:15.834
<v Speaker 2>one thing I would say is don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>overestimate the degree to which you </v>

140
00:07:18.541 --> 00:07:20.610
<v Speaker 2>don't want to be too integrated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause you know,</v>

141
00:07:20.611 --> 00:07:22.650
<v Speaker 2>modern people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in the west,</v>

142
00:07:22.651 --> 00:07:24.720
<v Speaker 2>they like to think of themselves as </v>
<v Speaker 2>individuals.</v>

143
00:07:24.721 --> 00:07:27.450
<v Speaker 2>It's like I have a hypothesis about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

144
00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:33.120
<v Speaker 2>I think people in the West are actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>the most conforming people in the entire</v>

145
00:07:33.121 --> 00:07:33.954
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

146
00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:34.900
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

147
00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:35.733
<v Speaker 2>And that's why they can sort of dance </v>
<v Speaker 2>around on top of that pr like they're </v>

148
00:07:38.651 --> 00:07:39.484
<v Speaker 2>free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason is everyone stops at the </v>

149
00:07:42.281 --> 00:07:44.410
<v Speaker 2>red lights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

150
00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:45.393
<v Speaker 2>everyone obeys everything virtually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you can dress weirdly and maybe </v>

151
00:07:49.931 --> 00:07:50.764
<v Speaker 2>you can have a bizarre opinion and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can go off and do something that's a </v>

152
00:07:53.381 --> 00:07:55.360
<v Speaker 2>little out of the ordinary in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>corner,</v>

153
00:07:55.361 --> 00:08:00.361
<v Speaker 2>but 99% of the time you're a conformist </v>
<v Speaker 2>right to the damn bone.</v>

154
00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.700
<v Speaker 2>And that's a good thing because if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't,</v>

155
00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.790
<v Speaker 2>the society wouldn't be so stable and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>predictable across,</v>

156
00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reasonable spans of time.</v>

157
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:10.903
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the idea that the west is </v>

158
00:08:11.921 --> 00:08:12.754
<v Speaker 2>individualistic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like we might represent </v>

159
00:08:14.171 --> 00:08:15.004
<v Speaker 2>individualism as a form of daddy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>aspire to it and we might even worship </v>

160
00:08:18.941 --> 00:08:21.880
<v Speaker 2>it when it occurs because we do with </v>
<v Speaker 2>celebrities and so forth.</v>

161
00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:23.043
<v Speaker 2>But that's by boat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By no means reasonable to assume that </v>

162
00:08:25.931 --> 00:08:27.880
<v Speaker 2>the west is primarily individualistic.</v>

163
00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:29.470
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

164
00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:34.420
<v Speaker 2>I grew up in western Canada and in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Edmonton,</v>

165
00:08:34.421 --> 00:08:35.254
<v Speaker 2>if there's a light that's red,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you know you're supposed to not </v>

166
00:08:37.961 --> 00:08:38.794
<v Speaker 2>walk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people will stand there on the street </v>

167
00:08:41.501 --> 00:08:45.310
<v Speaker 2>when it's 40 below and wait until the </v>
<v Speaker 2>light changes.</v>

168
00:08:45.311 --> 00:08:48.400
<v Speaker 2>Even if they can't see your car anywhere</v>
<v Speaker 2>near in any direction.</v>

169
00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:50.980
<v Speaker 2>Like it was quite shocking to me when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>first moved to Montreal.</v>

170
00:08:50.981 --> 00:08:52.780
<v Speaker 2>And people were Jay walking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

171
00:08:52.781 --> 00:08:56.190
<v Speaker 2>I thought God himself was going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>strike me down with if I did it.</v>

172
00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:57.253
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now that the roads are narrow and so </v>

173
00:08:58.681 --> 00:09:00.300
<v Speaker 2>that's part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

174
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:01.163
<v Speaker 2>but montrealers there's definitely a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>pushier as pedestrians than people in </v>

175
00:09:04.681 --> 00:09:05.514
<v Speaker 2>the west.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the other thing that's quite </v>

176
00:09:06.661 --> 00:09:07.494
<v Speaker 2>interesting about the west traffic </v>
<v Speaker 2>patterns is that if you're standing on </v>

177
00:09:09.841 --> 00:09:13.260
<v Speaker 2>the road looking like you might want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>cross,</v>

178
00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:16.290
<v Speaker 2>even if it's Jay walk and get a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>stop and let you cross,</v>

179
00:09:16.291 --> 00:09:18.270
<v Speaker 2>it's quite annoying because you just </v>
<v Speaker 2>standing there and it's like,</v>

180
00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:19.523
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five people stop and then you have to </v>

181
00:09:21.091 --> 00:09:23.670
<v Speaker 2>walk across the street just not to </v>
<v Speaker 2>disappoint them.</v>

182
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:27.660
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing about conformity is it is it,</v>

183
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:30.750
<v Speaker 2>it makes for a tremendous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>stability.</v>

184
00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:31.913
<v Speaker 2>And believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we wouldn't be promoting nonconformity </v>

185
00:09:33.961 --> 00:09:38.040
<v Speaker 2>if everyone was nonconforming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'd be thinking,</v>

186
00:09:38.041 --> 00:09:38.874
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's time to get this whole thing </v>

187
00:09:39.481 --> 00:09:41.430
<v Speaker 2>conforming quite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite tightly.</v>

188
00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:44.790
<v Speaker 2>One of the things I'd been thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about Islam lately is that,</v>

189
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:47.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

190
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:49.380
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you wanted to find a religion,</v>

191
00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:53.220
<v Speaker 2>we determine is a religion religion of </v>
<v Speaker 2>peace or of,</v>

192
00:09:53.221 --> 00:09:54.660
<v Speaker 2>of war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you think,</v>

193
00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:57.360
<v Speaker 2>well it might depend on the level of </v>
<v Speaker 2>analysis.</v>

194
00:09:57.361 --> 00:09:58.194
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that Islam did was </v>

195
00:09:59.881 --> 00:10:00.714
<v Speaker 2>take a society that was very tribal and </v>
<v Speaker 2>fractious and united across a large </v>

196
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.080
<v Speaker 2>portion of territory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know what,</v>

197
00:10:10.081 --> 00:10:10.914
<v Speaker 2>it did that by expanding its domains and</v>
<v Speaker 2>incorporating other people and also </v>

198
00:10:14.161 --> 00:10:14.994
<v Speaker 2>going to war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So on the fringes of the Islamic </v>

199
00:10:17.281 --> 00:10:18.114
<v Speaker 2>expansion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was all sorts of bloodshed and </v>

200
00:10:19.891 --> 00:10:20.724
<v Speaker 2>misery.</v>

201
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:24.120
<v Speaker 2>But then inside it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was this hierarchical organization</v>

202
00:10:24.121 --> 00:10:24.954
<v Speaker 2>of people that were basically only </v>
<v Speaker 2>organized into little bitty tribal </v>

203
00:10:27.691 --> 00:10:30.180
<v Speaker 2>groups before that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you might say,</v>

204
00:10:30.181 --> 00:10:31.014
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that within the expanding bubble of </v>

205
00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:34.950
<v Speaker 2>influence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was peaceful.</v>

206
00:10:34.951 --> 00:10:38.340
<v Speaker 2>And then on the fringes it was violent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you might say,</v>

207
00:10:38.341 --> 00:10:40.050
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does that mean over the long run?</v>

208
00:10:40.051 --> 00:10:40.884
<v Speaker 2>Is that warlike or peaceful?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't really know how to answer </v>

209
00:10:43.651 --> 00:10:45.240
<v Speaker 2>that question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

210
00:10:45.241 --> 00:10:47.760
<v Speaker 2>because it depends on which angle you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at it from.</v>

211
00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:49.313
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we certainly know that as humanity </v>

212
00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:55.020
<v Speaker 2>aggregated itself into a larger and </v>
<v Speaker 2>larger collectives,</v>

213
00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:59.370
<v Speaker 2>there was a lot of conflict that had to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be had in order for that to occur.</v>

214
00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:01.950
<v Speaker 2>But the consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you think about our,</v>

215
00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:05.370
<v Speaker 2>our lives at the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the probability that one of you will get</v>

216
00:11:05.371 --> 00:11:08.080
<v Speaker 2>killed by a homicide is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

217
00:11:08.081 --> 00:11:11.430
<v Speaker 2>it's vanishingly low.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you might ask yourself,</v>

218
00:11:11.431 --> 00:11:13.560
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much bloodshed and conflict did that</v>

219
00:11:13.561 --> 00:11:16.140
<v Speaker 2>take in?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

220
00:11:16.141 --> 00:11:20.070
<v Speaker 2>before everyone was hammered together so</v>
<v Speaker 2>damn tightly that well,</v>

221
00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:21.233
<v Speaker 2>here's another way of looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is it possible for women to have </v>

222
00:11:25.501 --> 00:11:26.670
<v Speaker 2>rights in the West?</v>

223
00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:28.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

224
00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:31.710
<v Speaker 2>I think the answer to that is because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they can go outside without being raped.</v>

225
00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:33.663
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole culture is so damn peaceful </v>

226
00:11:36.071 --> 00:11:41.071
<v Speaker 2>now that it's a woman can present </v>
<v Speaker 2>herself alone,</v>

227
00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:46.390
<v Speaker 2>two strange men and not die as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequence of it.</v>

228
00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:47.591
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

229
00:11:47.591 --> 00:11:49.570
<v Speaker 2>well then you can start talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>rights.</v>

230
00:11:49.571 --> 00:11:50.770
<v Speaker 2>It's before that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's</v>

231
00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:54.250
<v Speaker 3>whatever</v>

232
00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:56.080
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not right.</v>

233
00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.630
<v Speaker 2>Mostly what it is is protection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

234
00:11:58.631 --> 00:11:59.464
<v Speaker 2>you have to be protected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's lots of places in the world </v>

235
00:12:02.111 --> 00:12:03.970
<v Speaker 2>where that's still exactly the way it </v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

236
00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:05.373
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that even when I was traveling </v>

237
00:12:06.881 --> 00:12:09.910
<v Speaker 2>through Europe years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the eighties you know,</v>

238
00:12:09.911 --> 00:12:13.810
<v Speaker 2>I traveled with a friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a woman and her boyfriend,</v>

239
00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:16.960
<v Speaker 2>and when we went through Italy for </v>
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>

240
00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:18.063
<v Speaker 2>she was blonde.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was just harassed to death by the </v>

241
00:12:20.261 --> 00:12:21.370
<v Speaker 2>Italian men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

242
00:12:21.371 --> 00:12:22.810
<v Speaker 2>not in any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not in any way.</v>

243
00:12:22.811 --> 00:12:26.170
<v Speaker 2>That was brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it does.</v>

244
00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:30.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we took her over to Greece as well,</v>

245
00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:31.173
<v Speaker 2>and we went to this place called Patras </v>
<v Speaker 2>and patches had this absolutely weird </v>

246
00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:38.980
<v Speaker 2>celebration that was like the fourth </v>
<v Speaker 2>biggest celebration in the world.</v>

247
00:12:38.981 --> 00:12:39.814
<v Speaker 2>I'd never even heard of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things they do there is </v>

248
00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:46.330
<v Speaker 2>everybody goes on the street with these </v>
<v Speaker 2>plastic bats,</v>

249
00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:47.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're really light plastic.</v>

250
00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:50.350
<v Speaker 2>Pat's the kinds kid would use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were like this big round.</v>

251
00:12:50.351 --> 00:12:53.080
<v Speaker 2>They're plastic was firm enough so that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a bat,</v>

252
00:12:53.081 --> 00:12:53.914
<v Speaker 2>but soft enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you go whack with it in a semi </v>

253
00:12:56.231 --> 00:12:58.300
<v Speaker 2>playful way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't going to hurt.</v>

254
00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:01.360
<v Speaker 2>And then everybody also spraying each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other with silly string,</v>

255
00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:03.610
<v Speaker 2>which I thought was an extremely </v>
<v Speaker 2>bizarre,</v>

256
00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:04.683
<v Speaker 2>I mean that stuff was not old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like there's a million people out in </v>

257
00:13:06.641 --> 00:13:07.474
<v Speaker 2>the street and everybody's hitting each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other with bats and spraying each other </v>

258
00:13:10.121 --> 00:13:12.700
<v Speaker 2>with silly string.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this poor girl,</v>

259
00:13:12.701 --> 00:13:15.160
<v Speaker 2>she must be hit like 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>times,</v>

260
00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:16.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

261
00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:20.050
<v Speaker 2>and it wasn't malevolent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was playful,</v>

262
00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:20.891
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it had to be,</v>

263
00:13:20.891 --> 00:13:23.170
<v Speaker 2>because when everyone's hitting </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody else with bats,</v>

264
00:13:23.171 --> 00:13:25.300
<v Speaker 2>it bloody well better state playful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

265
00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:26.163
<v Speaker 2>But the pro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing is is that she couldn't move </v>

266
00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:32.350
<v Speaker 2>with anywhere near the same freedom that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could move.</v>

267
00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:33.753
<v Speaker 2>And that's only a tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tiny echo of what it would have been </v>

268
00:13:37.901 --> 00:13:42.610
<v Speaker 2>like in many places 500 years ago or a </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousand years ago.</v>

269
00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:44.200
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

270
00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:45.393
<v Speaker 2>there's this basis of absolute </v>
<v Speaker 2>conformity that's a prerequisite to as </v>

271
00:13:48.641 --> 00:13:49.474
<v Speaker 2>freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially freedom for people who are </v>

272
00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:52.323
<v Speaker 2>vulnerable in many ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's part of what's being </v>

273
00:13:55.901 --> 00:13:57.730
<v Speaker 2>celebrated in that image.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

274
00:13:57.731 --> 00:13:58.564
<v Speaker 2>if people are in the state of chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one thing that really attracts </v>

275
00:14:01.661 --> 00:14:03.220
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're attracted by order.</v>

276
00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:04.870
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

277
00:14:04.871 --> 00:14:07.000
<v Speaker 2>you always have to give the devil his </v>
<v Speaker 2>due.</v>

278
00:14:07.001 --> 00:14:10.020
<v Speaker 2>If you're trying to understand something</v>
<v Speaker 2>like not see as it,</v>

279
00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:14.770
<v Speaker 2>you have to understand why it might be </v>
<v Speaker 2>attractive to someone like you.</v>

280
00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:20.760
<v Speaker 2>Now the question is in part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why did it go so pathologically wrong?</v>

281
00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:23.980
<v Speaker 2>Well that's part of what we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>untangle,</v>

282
00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:25.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you might say,</v>

283
00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:28.720
<v Speaker 2>well you might have benevolent motives </v>
<v Speaker 2>in establishing order,</v>

284
00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:32.590
<v Speaker 2>but order shades into tyranny and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

285
00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:33.483
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your motivations for establishing </v>

286
00:14:35.801 --> 00:14:39.490
<v Speaker 2>tyranny might be completely self serving</v>
<v Speaker 2>and cruel.</v>

287
00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:40.623
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there may be a process that gets you to </v>

288
00:14:42.041 --> 00:14:45.370
<v Speaker 2>self serving and cruel certainly is what</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened with the Nazis.</v>

289
00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:47.890
<v Speaker 2>And the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that they're all along.</v>

290
00:14:47.891 --> 00:14:50.890
<v Speaker 2>Was it something that emerged?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it like the snake in the garden that</v>

291
00:14:50.891 --> 00:14:53.630
<v Speaker 2>was going to present itself?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

292
00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:56.210
<v Speaker 2>and you have Hitler on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the right there.</v>

293
00:14:56.211 --> 00:15:00.080
<v Speaker 2>And that's a Nazi art statue behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

294
00:15:00.081 --> 00:15:02.900
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of got this quasi Greek </v>
<v Speaker 2>element,</v>

295
00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:03.913
<v Speaker 2>although,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the Hitler was an admirer of </v>

296
00:15:06.171 --> 00:15:07.004
<v Speaker 2>classical statuary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then everything's exaggerated about </v>

297
00:15:10.041 --> 00:15:12.920
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's this sort of hyper masculine,</v>

298
00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:16.953
<v Speaker 2>well it's like hyper masculinize Greek </v>
<v Speaker 2>sculpture that was the part of the Nazi </v>

299
00:15:19.961 --> 00:15:20.794
<v Speaker 2>aesthetic.</v>

300
00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:29.580
<v Speaker 2>So that one on the left says one folk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one country,</v>

301
00:15:29.581 --> 00:15:31.590
<v Speaker 2>one leader.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what fear means,</v>

302
00:15:31.591 --> 00:15:32.424
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there you see that Hitler's head </v>

303
00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:37.380
<v Speaker 2>is assimilated to the idea of a country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

304
00:15:37.381 --> 00:15:38.214
<v Speaker 2>So it says this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something about this country </v>

305
00:15:40.321 --> 00:15:44.610
<v Speaker 2>that's Hitler's hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like you might think,</v>

306
00:15:44.611 --> 00:15:48.180
<v Speaker 2>do you ever use symbols like that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the answer is,</v>

307
00:15:48.181 --> 00:15:49.014
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sure every time you give someone a </v>

308
00:15:49.951 --> 00:15:51.660
<v Speaker 2>coin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

309
00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:54.810
<v Speaker 2>So Hitler's head is like the head of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>realm.</v>

310
00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:58.680
<v Speaker 2>And so what does that mean in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in some sense it means that the realm is</v>

311
00:15:58.681 --> 00:16:02.520
<v Speaker 2>an embodiment of Hitler or it's an </v>
<v Speaker 2>embodiment of the leader.</v>

312
00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:03.473
<v Speaker 2>And actually around me is the embodiment</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the leader because it's a body of </v>

313
00:16:06.301 --> 00:16:07.134
<v Speaker 2>laws.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what it represents is a mode of </v>

314
00:16:08.551 --> 00:16:10.980
<v Speaker 2>being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's what that expresses.</v>

315
00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:14.220
<v Speaker 2>And then you have him on the left there </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

316
00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:15.233
<v Speaker 2>you can kind of see what sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotions he thought were morally </v>

317
00:16:18.211 --> 00:16:21.480
<v Speaker 2>appropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's almost a career teacher,</v>

318
00:16:21.481 --> 00:16:22.314
<v Speaker 2>except there's about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an element of seriousness about </v>

319
00:16:24.331 --> 00:16:27.780
<v Speaker 2>it that's that that stops it from being </v>
<v Speaker 2>a caricatured.</v>

320
00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:31.020
<v Speaker 2>And so what do you have to say about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that picture on the right?</v>

321
00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:32.070
<v Speaker 2>What does that say to you?</v>

322
00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:42.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

323
00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:47.060
<v Speaker 2>So those are all positive things so far </v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't they?</v>

324
00:16:47.061 --> 00:16:47.894
<v Speaker 2>Could be argued to be that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see anything that isn't like that </v>

325
00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:53.210
<v Speaker 2>there's some disdain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

326
00:16:53.211 --> 00:16:54.410
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who said that?</v>

327
00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:56.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems,</v>

328
00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:57.830
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some disdain.</v>

329
00:16:57.831 --> 00:17:01.100
<v Speaker 2>It's partly the narrowed eyebrows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's partly the fact that his face is up</v>

330
00:17:01.101 --> 00:17:05.060
<v Speaker 2>a little bit and disdain is associated </v>
<v Speaker 2>with contempt and disgust.</v>

331
00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:06.163
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I would also say there was some </v>

332
00:17:07.431 --> 00:17:10.550
<v Speaker 2>arrogance in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Partly it's the sideways pose,</v>

333
00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:12.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause it's a real pose.</v>

334
00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:13.423
<v Speaker 2>And so</v>

335
00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:21.410
<v Speaker 3>I'd almost say I looked at it and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think you almost answered that.</v>

336
00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:27.050
<v Speaker 3>Normally he kind of touches ugly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>scary.</v>

337
00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:31.560
<v Speaker 3>But this one's almost like timid little </v>
<v Speaker 3>boy.</v>

338
00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:32.413
<v Speaker 3>I grew up,</v>

339
00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:37.380
<v Speaker 2>well I think one of the things that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think you can see in the picture is over</v>

340
00:17:37.381 --> 00:17:39.400
<v Speaker 2>compensation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

341
00:17:39.401 --> 00:17:44.401
<v Speaker 2>because you shouldn't be any more </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominant that is necessary,</v>

342
00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:46.413
<v Speaker 2>but you really have to be well put </v>
<v Speaker 2>together not to be more dominant is </v>

343
00:17:49.291 --> 00:17:50.124
<v Speaker 2>necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think the dominance is a </v>

344
00:17:51.841 --> 00:17:56.841
<v Speaker 2>compensation at least in part for </v>
<v Speaker 2>childhood inadequacy and weakness.</v>

345
00:17:57.090 --> 00:18:02.090
<v Speaker 2>That was actually one of the central </v>
<v Speaker 2>axioms of Adler Adlerian theory.</v>

346
00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:03.503
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that what people were doing as they </v>

347
00:18:04.381 --> 00:18:05.214
<v Speaker 2>progressed towards adulthood was </v>
<v Speaker 2>compensating for the inferiority of </v>

348
00:18:08.311 --> 00:18:10.020
<v Speaker 2>their childhood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

349
00:18:10.021 --> 00:18:13.080
<v Speaker 2>and he said they'd often overcompensate </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

350
00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:13.943
<v Speaker 2>if you watch your own behavior you will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could see that happening all the </v>

351
00:18:17.071 --> 00:18:18.540
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Happens all the time.</v>

352
00:18:18.541 --> 00:18:22.940
<v Speaker 2>It's extraordinarily difficult not to </v>
<v Speaker 2>push any harder than you have to win.</v>

353
00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:23.803
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's because you're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>look better than you are tougher than </v>

354
00:18:26.491 --> 00:18:27.210
<v Speaker 2>you are.</v>

355
00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:28.043
<v Speaker 2>And I think there is an element that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can see in that cause it's like it's a </v>

356
00:18:31.501 --> 00:18:32.880
<v Speaker 2>bit too much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

357
00:18:32.881 --> 00:18:33.714
<v Speaker 2>And I would also say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things I've noticed about </v>

358
00:18:35.851 --> 00:18:36.684
<v Speaker 2>people who have really mastered </v>
<v Speaker 2>something is that they can do it with a </v>

359
00:18:40.021 --> 00:18:42.330
<v Speaker 2>touch of humor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if it's really serious.</v>

360
00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:43.673
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I had this thought when I was </v>

361
00:18:44.581 --> 00:18:47.250
<v Speaker 2>teaching this material probably 15 years</v>
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>

362
00:18:47.251 --> 00:18:50.130
<v Speaker 2>I thought there was a little voice in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>head that said,</v>

363
00:18:50.131 --> 00:18:50.581
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

364
00:18:50.581 --> 00:18:52.080
<v Speaker 2>you should lighten up a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I thought,</v>

365
00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:54.460
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about genocides,</v>

366
00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:54.900
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

367
00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:55.733
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to lighten up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I thought if I was thinking </v>

368
00:18:59.851 --> 00:19:00.684
<v Speaker 2>about young's notion of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the gesture and the joker as a </v>

369
00:19:03.661 --> 00:19:06.370
<v Speaker 2>precursor to the savior there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this element of,</v>

370
00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:07.483
<v Speaker 2>of subversion and humor that goes along </v>
<v Speaker 2>with attempting to crack a difficult </v>

371
00:19:11.221 --> 00:19:12.980
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

372
00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:15.600
<v Speaker 2>I thought about that for about five </v>
<v Speaker 2>years and I thought,</v>

373
00:19:15.601 --> 00:19:16.291
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's right.</v>

374
00:19:16.291 --> 00:19:17.190
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

375
00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:18.323
<v Speaker 2>if there isn't</v>

376
00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:19.620
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

377
00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:20.453
<v Speaker 2>if there isn't something that's akin to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the sort of thing that a comedian does </v>

378
00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:28.740
<v Speaker 2>when you're talking about something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're doing it too seriously.</v>

379
00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:31.890
<v Speaker 2>It means you haven't mastered it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't do it with a light touch.</v>

380
00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:34.650
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think you can see that in him.</v>

381
00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:39.243
<v Speaker 2>Well there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's one on the left there that's </v>

382
00:19:40.661 --> 00:19:43.900
<v Speaker 2>Hitler for president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what do you,</v>

383
00:19:43.901 --> 00:19:45.100
<v Speaker 2>what do you see in that</v>

384
00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:50.030
<v Speaker 3>clear direction?</v>

385
00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:51.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What else?</v>

386
00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:52.680
<v Speaker 2>How would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

387
00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:57.680
<v Speaker 2>how is there an indication of clear </v>
<v Speaker 2>direction is sort of posture.</v>

388
00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:03.593
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

389
00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:06.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

390
00:20:06.491 --> 00:20:07.440
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

391
00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:08.350
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

392
00:20:08.351 --> 00:20:08.831
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

393
00:20:08.831 --> 00:20:11.160
<v Speaker 2>it's very intense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

394
00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:12.033
<v Speaker 2>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a force moving upward and </v>

395
00:20:14.291 --> 00:20:17.140
<v Speaker 2>he's at the top of the forest of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>lines go weirdly,</v>

396
00:20:17.141 --> 00:20:17.974
<v Speaker 2>they go to the left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is quite interesting because </v>

397
00:20:19.361 --> 00:20:20.194
<v Speaker 2>generally the way you would read a </v>
<v Speaker 2>poster like that is that harsh movement </v>

398
00:20:23.711 --> 00:20:25.390
<v Speaker 2>to the left is regressive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

399
00:20:25.391 --> 00:20:27.130
<v Speaker 2>It's backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

400
00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:29.343
<v Speaker 2>you can understand why that might be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's clearly the thing that sits on </v>

401
00:20:32.621 --> 00:20:35.200
<v Speaker 2>top of the pillars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember I showed you a picture of,</v>

402
00:20:35.201 --> 00:20:35.831
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cyrus,</v>

403
00:20:35.831 --> 00:20:38.800
<v Speaker 2>you may not remember this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was all cyrus's hand on a pillar.</v>

404
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:39.833
<v Speaker 2>It's the same idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know that his body is the body of </v>

405
00:20:42.041 --> 00:20:44.560
<v Speaker 2>the state and the state has this </v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful movement forward.</v>

406
00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:45.603
<v Speaker 2>Then there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is an infamous picture this in the </v>

407
00:20:47.261 --> 00:20:50.980
<v Speaker 2>middle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what do you think about that?</v>

408
00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:55.250
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a knight.</v>

409
00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:57.110
<v Speaker 2>He's a white knight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact.</v>

410
00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:58.513
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's assimilated to the idea of </v>

411
00:21:00.291 --> 00:21:02.270
<v Speaker 2>medieval nobility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

412
00:21:02.271 --> 00:21:05.300
<v Speaker 2>and in its purest form,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a knight of the people,</v>

413
00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:06.950
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

414
00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:08.210
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

415
00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:09.043
<v Speaker 2>there's a Wagnerian element to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was a great admirer of Wagner </v>

416
00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:12.253
<v Speaker 2>Wagnerian music right away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Hitler wanted to put music halls in </v>

417
00:21:14.691 --> 00:21:17.390
<v Speaker 2>every classical music halls in every </v>
<v Speaker 2>city in Europe.</v>

418
00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:22.130
<v Speaker 2>It was starting to obsession of his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was obsessed with Wagnerian opera.</v>

419
00:21:22.131 --> 00:21:26.840
<v Speaker 2>And he claimed that he had quasi </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious experiences listening to it,</v>

420
00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:30.320
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So He's a very strange character because</v>

421
00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:31.813
<v Speaker 2>Hitler was extremely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>appears to have been extremely high and </v>

422
00:21:35.081 --> 00:21:35.914
<v Speaker 2>openness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is not something you would expect </v>

423
00:21:37.521 --> 00:21:39.580
<v Speaker 2>for someone who was a tyrant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

424
00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:40.423
<v Speaker 2>because conservative people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically very low in openness and very </v>

425
00:21:43.941 --> 00:21:44.774
<v Speaker 2>high in orderliness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he appeared to be someone who is </v>

426
00:21:46.731 --> 00:21:49.370
<v Speaker 2>very high in orderliness and very high </v>
<v Speaker 2>in openness.</v>

427
00:21:49.371 --> 00:21:51.770
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that made him charismatic,</v>

428
00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:54.260
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a deeply conservative element</v>

429
00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:58.640
<v Speaker 2>and an element that was obsessed with </v>
<v Speaker 2>will and antithetical to chaos.</v>

430
00:21:58.641 --> 00:22:03.310
<v Speaker 2>But he was able to bring this tremendous</v>
<v Speaker 2>artistic force into his pope,</v>

431
00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:06.140
<v Speaker 2>politicking and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was captivating to people,</v>

432
00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:27.453
<v Speaker 1>hmm.</v>

433
00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:16.370
<v Speaker 2>To what was conference Satori.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

434
00:23:16.371 --> 00:23:18.890
<v Speaker 2>Well I think that's a perfectly </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasonable way of thinking about it.</v>

435
00:23:18.891 --> 00:23:21.710
<v Speaker 2>But I also think he was open by </v>
<v Speaker 2>temperament.</v>

436
00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:22.903
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the things that happens to</v>
<v Speaker 2>open people is that if they listened to </v>

437
00:23:26.361 --> 00:23:28.940
<v Speaker 2>music that really captures them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

438
00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:30.860
<v Speaker 2>the hair stands up on the back of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>neck.</v>

439
00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:34.310
<v Speaker 2>There they are experienced experiences </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of ad hand,</v>

440
00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:36.013
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I also think it's very easy for </v>

441
00:23:37.071 --> 00:23:39.620
<v Speaker 2>people to assume that if they're having </v>
<v Speaker 2>that experience,</v>

442
00:23:39.621 --> 00:23:42.770
<v Speaker 2>that they're being inhabited by </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that's akin to divinity.</v>

443
00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:44.720
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

444
00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:45.963
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to make light of that </v>

445
00:23:46.941 --> 00:23:49.850
<v Speaker 2>kind of experience because music is </v>
<v Speaker 2>incredibly gripping.</v>

446
00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:52.310
<v Speaker 2>Almost everyone likes music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

447
00:23:52.311 --> 00:23:54.830
<v Speaker 2>some people like conventional music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>

448
00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:58.610
<v Speaker 2>they can tolerate a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>exposure to the divine force of music.</v>

449
00:23:58.820 --> 00:23:59.653
<v Speaker 2>Not much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's usually conservatives because </v>

450
00:24:00.861 --> 00:24:04.430
<v Speaker 2>they listened to very conventional pop </v>
<v Speaker 2>music.</v>

451
00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:08.930
<v Speaker 2>And then there's this wide variation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but almost across almost all people,</v>

452
00:24:08.931 --> 00:24:13.700
<v Speaker 2>music produces this influx of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Dionysian force,</v>

453
00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:16.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really hyper conservative.</v>

454
00:24:16.221 --> 00:24:18.820
<v Speaker 2>So band music and dancing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

455
00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:22.130
<v Speaker 2>So because it's subversive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

456
00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:24.560
<v Speaker 2>and then you have the one on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the right.</v>

457
00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:26.270
<v Speaker 2>So tell me about that one.</v>

458
00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:39.640
<v Speaker 1>Especially the middle one that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>barely when facing the Friday.</v>

459
00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:44.780
<v Speaker 1>So you can imagine you staring at the of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and the next one is like light behind</v>

460
00:24:45.691 --> 00:24:50.190
<v Speaker 1>him acting out like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to save everything.</v>

461
00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:51.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

462
00:24:51.501 --> 00:24:54.600
<v Speaker 2>He's at the forefront of the heroic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

463
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:57.770
<v Speaker 2>what would you call that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's enrollment formation.</v>

464
00:24:58.490 --> 00:24:59.360
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

465
00:24:59.361 --> 00:25:01.380
<v Speaker 2>He's at the very forefront of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

466
00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:02.990
<v Speaker 2>And so yes.</v>

467
00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:04.163
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did say</v>

468
00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:05.861
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go ahead.</v>

469
00:25:05.861 --> 00:25:06.694
<v Speaker 2>Go ahead.</v>

470
00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:08.080
<v Speaker 1>Oh my</v>

471
00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:11.330
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

472
00:25:11.331 --> 00:25:12.470
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what's happening,</v>

473
00:25:12.471 --> 00:25:13.304
<v Speaker 2>if you look at that image,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like that's Christ with the Holy </v>

474
00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:17.173
<v Speaker 2>Ghost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Holy Ghost is represented by a dog </v>

475
00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:19.963
<v Speaker 2>and that's often associated and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christian symbolism with the Messenger </v>

476
00:25:23.361 --> 00:25:26.870
<v Speaker 2>of God manifesting itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In some sense.</v>

477
00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:30.890
<v Speaker 2>One of the deeper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deepest Christian ideas is the idea that</v>

478
00:25:30.891 --> 00:25:35.891
<v Speaker 2>when Christ died and left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was something left behind that was</v>

479
00:25:35.931 --> 00:25:36.764
<v Speaker 2>still divine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that could communicate with human </v>

480
00:25:38.211 --> 00:25:39.044
<v Speaker 2>beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was partly outside at partly </v>

481
00:25:40.761 --> 00:25:41.594
<v Speaker 2>inside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the thing about Hitler is that it's </v>

482
00:25:43.401 --> 00:25:47.450
<v Speaker 2>not a dove that's an eagle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>An Eagle is a carrion eater,</v>

483
00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:48.950
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a bird of prey.</v>

484
00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:50.413
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's very interesting image because </v>

485
00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:53.323
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to come to terms with the fact </v>

486
00:25:55.311 --> 00:25:59.930
<v Speaker 2>that Hitler was a master of speech and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that made him a master of logos,</v>

487
00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:02.270
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that speech and communication,</v>

488
00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:04.730
<v Speaker 2>but the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

489
00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:08.720
<v Speaker 2>that that seemed to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's difficult to deny that that</v>

490
00:26:08.721 --> 00:26:11.510
<v Speaker 2>was perverted in the favor of something </v>
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

491
00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:12.583
<v Speaker 2>And so the spirit that is coming out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the sun and flying b behind Hitler is a </v>

492
00:26:17.151 --> 00:26:20.890
<v Speaker 2>devouring carry on eating bird of prey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

493
00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:21.591
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

494
00:26:21.591 --> 00:26:22.940
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people think eagles,</v>

495
00:26:22.941 --> 00:26:24.110
<v Speaker 2>they're powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is the,</v>

496
00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:26.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the national bird of the United States,</v>

497
00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:27.133
<v Speaker 2>Benjamin Franklin recommended that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be the Turkey and everyone laughs </v>

498
00:26:29.961 --> 00:26:31.950
<v Speaker 2>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

499
00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:33.230
<v Speaker 2>it's worth thinking about.</v>

500
00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:36.570
<v Speaker 1>Can't you also kind of say the Burger </v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

501
00:26:36.610 --> 00:26:37.443
<v Speaker 1>Would be like a felt in the chorus in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>way that he has this great vision and </v>

502
00:26:41.441 --> 00:26:42.110
<v Speaker 1>sight?</v>

503
00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:43.620
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

504
00:26:43.621 --> 00:26:44.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean</v>

505
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:45.720
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no shortage of it.</v>

506
00:26:45.721 --> 00:26:50.040
<v Speaker 3>I've things about eagles that inspire </v>
<v Speaker 3>admiration in people,</v>

507
00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:53.200
<v Speaker 3>but it's not a dove.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

508
00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:55.990
<v Speaker 2>So the message and it's black,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not white,</v>

509
00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:57.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the message is quite,</v>

510
00:26:57.820 --> 00:26:59.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the flag itself,</v>

511
00:26:59.171 --> 00:27:00.004
<v Speaker 2>those are the three primary colors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you look around cultures </v>

512
00:27:02.771 --> 00:27:06.250
<v Speaker 2>worldwide and you look at names for </v>
<v Speaker 2>colors,</v>

513
00:27:06.790 --> 00:27:09.670
<v Speaker 2>every culture has a name for black,</v>
<v Speaker 2>white and red.</v>

514
00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:10.743
<v Speaker 2>And then after that the color is </v>
<v Speaker 2>fragments so that some are more </v>

515
00:27:13.871 --> 00:27:15.700
<v Speaker 2>frequently named than others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

516
00:27:15.701 --> 00:27:18.160
<v Speaker 2>because you can start well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like his orange rand.</v>

517
00:27:18.550 --> 00:27:19.600
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

518
00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:23.260
<v Speaker 2>yes and no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It depends on how differentiated your,</v>

519
00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:24.880
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your languages.</v>

520
00:27:24.881 --> 00:27:26.470
<v Speaker 2>But black,</v>
<v Speaker 2>white and red,</v>

521
00:27:27.010 --> 00:27:29.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fruit day and night.</v>

522
00:27:29.921 --> 00:27:32.470
<v Speaker 2>That's one way of looking at her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's blood day and night.</v>

523
00:27:33.010 --> 00:27:33.843
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or it's rage day and night or war day </v>

524
00:27:36.461 --> 00:27:38.290
<v Speaker 2>and night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's a powerful symbol.</v>

525
00:27:38.291 --> 00:27:41.230
<v Speaker 2>It's also a sun symbol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a sanskrit symbol,</v>

526
00:27:41.231 --> 00:27:43.840
<v Speaker 2>but it's rotating backwards instead of </v>
<v Speaker 2>forwards.</v>

527
00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:45.213
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

528
00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:46.870
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

529
00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:47.703
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the Nazis were very aware in many </v>

530
00:27:49.901 --> 00:27:52.450
<v Speaker 2>ways of the meanings of the images that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were using.</v>

531
00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:53.823
<v Speaker 2>But I'm showing you this because I want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to show you how the archetypes were </v>

532
00:27:57.551 --> 00:28:02.551
<v Speaker 2>captured by the propagandist </v>
<v Speaker 2>propagandists or hold the archetypes are</v>

533
00:28:03.611 --> 00:28:04.444
<v Speaker 2>actually manifesting themselves in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense to produce the kind of powerful </v>

534
00:28:08.171 --> 00:28:09.004
<v Speaker 2>grip that Hitler had over his audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was certainly the archetypes of </v>

535
00:28:11.891 --> 00:28:13.690
<v Speaker 2>order,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the archetypes of heroism.</v>

536
00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:18.160
<v Speaker 2>All of those are being put at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>service of a political ideology.</v>

537
00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:21.520
<v Speaker 2>Riley's father images or individual </v>
<v Speaker 2>images.</v>

538
00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:23.890
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're both,</v>

539
00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:26.740
<v Speaker 2>it depends on the image,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

540
00:28:26.741 --> 00:28:31.741
<v Speaker 2>So in some images he's more like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>father of the people and other images.</v>

541
00:28:31.931 --> 00:28:35.110
<v Speaker 2>He's more like the heroic Mara Duck at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

542
00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:37.840
<v Speaker 2>at the forefront of the march into </v>
<v Speaker 2>battle with,</v>

543
00:28:38.030 --> 00:28:41.860
<v Speaker 2>with the illuminated God's behind them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

544
00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:45.490
<v Speaker 2>and there's no reason for him not to </v>
<v Speaker 2>take on both symbolic aspects.</v>

545
00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:47.620
<v Speaker 2>Like we know for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that as far as the,</v>

546
00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:49.083
<v Speaker 2>as the Egyptians were concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ideal pharaoh was Hafele Cyrus and </v>

547
00:28:52.091 --> 00:28:53.800
<v Speaker 2>half horace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

548
00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:54.813
<v Speaker 2>So embodied stability and also the </v>
<v Speaker 2>vision and the capacity to update that </v>

549
00:28:59.501 --> 00:29:01.030
<v Speaker 2>stability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

550
00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:06.100
<v Speaker 2>so this is actually counter propaganda </v>
<v Speaker 2>or maybe it's not,</v>

551
00:29:06.101 --> 00:29:06.934
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's an attempt to represent the </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of Hitler that isn't being </v>

552
00:29:09.011 --> 00:29:14.011
<v Speaker 2>represented by the German propaganda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So on the left you have,</v>

553
00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:19.300
<v Speaker 2>well those are Nazi snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've got swastikas all over them.</v>

554
00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:24.700
<v Speaker 2>And so that's an interesting image as </v>
<v Speaker 2>far as I'm concerned because you see how</v>

555
00:29:24.701 --> 00:29:28.960
<v Speaker 2>logical it is to use the image of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>knotted up snakes.</v>

556
00:29:28.961 --> 00:29:30.790
<v Speaker 2>And there's a frog in there too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way.</v>

557
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.650
<v Speaker 2>Snakes and frogs all nodded together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes a,</v>

558
00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:37.670
<v Speaker 2>a representation of the enemy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the evil enemy.</v>

559
00:29:37.690 --> 00:29:39.550
<v Speaker 2>Like you get that at a glance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

560
00:29:39.551 --> 00:29:40.570
<v Speaker 2>You don't need that bloody thing.</v>

561
00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:42.430
<v Speaker 2>Interpreted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Makes perfect sense.</v>

562
00:29:43.090 --> 00:29:45.100
<v Speaker 2>You know when you see the same things </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>

563
00:29:45.101 --> 00:29:45.934
<v Speaker 2>And Leonardo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I showed you some of the in </v>

564
00:29:47.651 --> 00:29:52.270
<v Speaker 2>representations of Mary when she's </v>
<v Speaker 2>holding the infant out of the way of the</v>

565
00:29:52.271 --> 00:29:54.400
<v Speaker 2>snake or the lizard that she's stepping </v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

566
00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:57.940
<v Speaker 2>It's a very similar idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you have Hitler's head there as</v>

567
00:29:57.941 --> 00:30:00.010
<v Speaker 2>a spreading hydra.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

568
00:30:00.011 --> 00:30:01.480
<v Speaker 2>he's sort of like a finger of death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

569
00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:05.890
<v Speaker 2>he's sort of like Ursula in the Little </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mermaid,</v>

570
00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:07.510
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Except he's,</v>

571
00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:08.920
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

572
00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:10.023
<v Speaker 2>it's not only a masculine image that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the spreading tentacles that </v>

573
00:30:13.091 --> 00:30:13.924
<v Speaker 2>snake like again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so there's an element of the Medusa </v>

574
00:30:15.731 --> 00:30:18.790
<v Speaker 2>there that's a very archaic symbol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

575
00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:21.940
<v Speaker 2>And then you have another image on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right there,</v>

576
00:30:21.941 --> 00:30:22.774
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

577
00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:28.040
<v Speaker 2>a graphical representation of Hitler and</v>
<v Speaker 2>his head is tangled up with the snake.</v>

578
00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:30.053
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

579
00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:33.810
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

580
00:30:33.810 --> 00:30:34.830
<v Speaker 2>you can see,</v>

581
00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:36.410
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

582
00:30:36.410 --> 00:30:40.400
<v Speaker 2>the reason those images have power is </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there</v>

583
00:30:41.450 --> 00:30:45.980
<v Speaker 2>they're taking the power that's implicit</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the archetype and harnessing it for a</v>

584
00:30:45.981 --> 00:30:49.560
<v Speaker 2>message that's been sent in a sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually what propaganda is like,</v>

585
00:30:49.561 --> 00:30:50.394
<v Speaker 2>if you know the nature of the message </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're using the archetype to </v>

586
00:30:53.691 --> 00:30:55.790
<v Speaker 2>promote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's propaganda.</v>

587
00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:56.953
<v Speaker 2>If you're trying to figure something </v>
<v Speaker 2>else out and the symbolic </v>

588
00:30:59.510 --> 00:31:02.960
<v Speaker 2>representations come to mind as part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the creative process,</v>

589
00:31:03.170 --> 00:31:04.003
<v Speaker 2>then that's not propaganda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then it also usually means that you </v>

590
00:31:06.741 --> 00:31:10.280
<v Speaker 2>end up producing a piece of art that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually don't understand.</v>

591
00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:11.713
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's still lots of renaissance </v>

592
00:31:12.711 --> 00:31:13.544
<v Speaker 2>artists like that you like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it contains information that we haven't </v>

593
00:31:15.621 --> 00:31:18.170
<v Speaker 2>even come close to processing yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

594
00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:22.250
<v Speaker 2>and I think most artistic </v>
<v Speaker 2>representations or you know,</v>

595
00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:26.390
<v Speaker 2>partly propaganda and properly our pro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>partly art,</v>

596
00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:27.950
<v Speaker 2>it depends on the representation.</v>

597
00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:33.670
<v Speaker 2>So then on the left you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again that's,</v>

598
00:31:33.730 --> 00:31:34.563
<v Speaker 2>that's anti Nazi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an anti Nazi poster and you have </v>

599
00:31:37.691 --> 00:31:38.524
<v Speaker 2>the idea of the dark figure lurking in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the background who sort of everywhere </v>

600
00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:44.673
<v Speaker 2>gazing at you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's like George Orwell's big </v>

601
00:31:46.721 --> 00:31:47.351
<v Speaker 2>brother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

602
00:31:47.351 --> 00:31:48.184
<v Speaker 2>So that's definitely harnessing the idea</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the terrible aspect of the great </v>

603
00:31:51.011 --> 00:31:53.260
<v Speaker 2>father.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I really liked this one on the,</v>

604
00:31:53.530 --> 00:31:57.220
<v Speaker 2>on the right because that's basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's the virgin and child,</v>

605
00:31:57.221 --> 00:31:57.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a,</v>

606
00:31:57.940 --> 00:31:58.773
<v Speaker 2>it's not precisely a Christian image.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter because that's not </v>

607
00:32:00.971 --> 00:32:01.804
<v Speaker 2>precisely a Christian representation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she's beautiful and young and she's </v>

608
00:32:05.081 --> 00:32:07.390
<v Speaker 2>holding something that's very vulnerable</v>
<v Speaker 2>in her arms.</v>

609
00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:11.100
<v Speaker 2>And then you see these hands at the top </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

610
00:32:11.290 --> 00:32:12.710
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nazi.</v>

611
00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:14.500
<v Speaker 2>And at the bottom there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Japanese,</v>

612
00:32:14.650 --> 00:32:15.483
<v Speaker 2>because the symbols are on them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so one's coming from one end and </v>

613
00:32:17.921 --> 00:32:20.380
<v Speaker 2>one's coming from the other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what are the hands look like?</v>

614
00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:23.393
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

615
00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:24.051
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

616
00:32:24.051 --> 00:32:24.980
<v Speaker 2>but why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>

617
00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:25.440
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

618
00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:26.960
<v Speaker 2>what makes them evil?</v>

619
00:32:28.210 --> 00:32:29.043
<v Speaker 3>Shadows.</v>

620
00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:30.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have claws.</v>

621
00:32:30.521 --> 00:32:32.050
<v Speaker 2>So they're predatory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

622
00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:33.273
<v Speaker 2>And their wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they're sort of like death and </v>

623
00:32:35.411 --> 00:32:37.000
<v Speaker 2>they're black.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

624
00:32:37.001 --> 00:32:38.410
<v Speaker 2>the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so obvious,</v>

625
00:32:38.411 --> 00:32:39.020
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

626
00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:40.850
<v Speaker 2>those are evil hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question is,</v>

627
00:32:40.851 --> 00:32:43.580
<v Speaker 2>why do you know that they're evil hands?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

628
00:32:43.581 --> 00:32:47.270
<v Speaker 2>what is it about the image that </v>
<v Speaker 2>announces itself in that way?</v>

629
00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:52.040
<v Speaker 2>It's also partly because of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>juxtaposition with the image of purity.</v>

630
00:32:52.041 --> 00:32:52.874
<v Speaker 2>So that's really the absolute corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great farther reaching out for the </v>

631
00:32:57.621 --> 00:33:02.621
<v Speaker 2>absolute perfect feminine and hero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the baby hero and threatening that.</v>

632
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:15.080
<v Speaker 2>So there's some anti Jewish propaganda </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the right there.</v>

633
00:33:15.081 --> 00:33:18.590
<v Speaker 2>So first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Jewish guy is represented as a money</v>

634
00:33:18.591 --> 00:33:22.910
<v Speaker 2>changer and he's associated with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Soviet Union because they,</v>

635
00:33:23.010 --> 00:33:23.843
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the onsies drew a tight relationship </v>

636
00:33:25.071 --> 00:33:25.904
<v Speaker 2>between Jews and communism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that was amalgamated into the </v>

637
00:33:30.291 --> 00:33:32.380
<v Speaker 2>same kind of threat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

638
00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:35.150
<v Speaker 2>and certainly the case that Germany was </v>
<v Speaker 2>threatened by communism.</v>

639
00:33:35.151 --> 00:33:36.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's absolutely no doubt about</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

640
00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:40.250
<v Speaker 2>but say sort of lump their enemies into </v>
<v Speaker 2>one category.</v>

641
00:33:40.251 --> 00:33:44.090
<v Speaker 2>And so what do you think about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>representation on the right?</v>

642
00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:49.120
<v Speaker 2>What does it say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe so.</v>

643
00:33:55.970 --> 00:33:57.020
<v Speaker 2>A whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you say?</v>

644
00:33:58.620 --> 00:33:59.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No I don't.</v>

645
00:33:59.630 --> 00:34:03.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So his eyes are closed.</v>

646
00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:05.570
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

647
00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:08.810
<v Speaker 2>his hands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his outstretched with money and he seems</v>

648
00:34:08.811 --> 00:34:09.644
<v Speaker 2>to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say is hand head is oriented </v>

649
00:34:11.181 --> 00:34:13.280
<v Speaker 2>towards the money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

650
00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:14.510
<v Speaker 2>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that right?</v>

651
00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:18.590
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know what he's leaning on </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

652
00:34:18.591 --> 00:34:19.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what that is,</v>

653
00:34:22.490 --> 00:34:25.010
<v Speaker 2>but it's obviously not a flattery </v>
<v Speaker 2>representation.</v>

654
00:34:25.011 --> 00:34:28.040
<v Speaker 2>And then you have the middle </v>
<v Speaker 2>representation.</v>

655
00:34:28.041 --> 00:34:28.874
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

656
00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:37.473
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

657
00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:44.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good one.</v>

658
00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:44.641
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

659
00:34:44.641 --> 00:34:46.890
<v Speaker 2>There is a goal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an element to that.</v>

660
00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:48.540
<v Speaker 2>Do you want to explain what that means?</v>

661
00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:00.830
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

662
00:35:05.610 --> 00:35:07.800
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a Zombie.</v>

663
00:35:07.930 --> 00:35:08.763
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carry out the will of the last </v>

664
00:35:25.930 --> 00:35:26.763
<v Speaker 1>murderous.</v>

665
00:35:29.490 --> 00:35:30.180
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

666
00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:31.013
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

667
00:35:31.050 --> 00:35:31.883
<v Speaker 2>so there's that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a sort of undead element to the </v>

668
00:35:33.631 --> 00:35:37.230
<v Speaker 2>representation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Blind focused only on money.</v>

669
00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:39.290
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

670
00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:43.140
<v Speaker 2>and then also aligned with this terrible</v>
<v Speaker 2>destructive force of communism.</v>

671
00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:45.190
<v Speaker 2>So another comment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

672
00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:51.561
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

673
00:35:51.561 --> 00:35:52.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good point.</v>

674
00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:53.630
<v Speaker 2>Good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

675
00:35:53.810 --> 00:35:54.643
<v Speaker 2>So then there's the middle one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you see the juxtaposition of the </v>

676
00:35:58.391 --> 00:36:02.290
<v Speaker 2>Jewish Star of David with the communist </v>
<v Speaker 2>hammer and sickle,</v>

677
00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:06.790
<v Speaker 2>and you see the whole world on fire and </v>
<v Speaker 2>death emerging from that.</v>

678
00:36:06.791 --> 00:36:08.020
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a,</v>

679
00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:11.530
<v Speaker 2>there's an idea of the ultimate call </v>
<v Speaker 2>apocalypse behind that.</v>

680
00:36:11.531 --> 00:36:12.364
<v Speaker 2>There's an idea of hell behind that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's an idea of like the living dead </v>

681
00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:17.740
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>

682
00:36:18.010 --> 00:36:18.843
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is something that's sitting on </v>

683
00:36:20.171 --> 00:36:22.840
<v Speaker 2>top of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very say titanic image,</v>

684
00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:27.150
<v Speaker 2>I think it says,</v>

685
00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:29.820
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

686
00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:31.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's Bolshevik.</v>

687
00:36:31.381 --> 00:36:33.570
<v Speaker 2>Part of that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know if there's an amalgam,</v>

688
00:36:33.571 --> 00:36:34.404
<v Speaker 2>there is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if is miss is a reference to Jewishness </v>

689
00:36:37.381 --> 00:36:40.560
<v Speaker 2>or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it says Bolshevism unmasked.</v>

690
00:36:40.561 --> 00:36:41.610
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that.</v>

691
00:36:42.910 --> 00:36:43.743
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

692
00:36:45.610 --> 00:36:46.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the idea that,</v>

693
00:36:46.990 --> 00:36:50.530
<v Speaker 2>that the Nazis were anticommunist was </v>
<v Speaker 2>very powerful idea for people.</v>

694
00:36:50.531 --> 00:36:54.310
<v Speaker 2>It made the morality of the situation </v>
<v Speaker 2>very murky in many ways.</v>

695
00:36:54.311 --> 00:36:55.144
<v Speaker 2>Because for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the Nazis went into Russia through </v>

696
00:36:57.821 --> 00:36:58.654
<v Speaker 2>the Ukraine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Ukrainian started to fight with the </v>

697
00:37:00.491 --> 00:37:02.980
<v Speaker 2>Nazis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like alongside of them to get rid of the</v>

698
00:37:02.981 --> 00:37:05.290
<v Speaker 2>communists because as far as they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>concerned,</v>

699
00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:08.260
<v Speaker 2>the communists were worse than the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nazis.</v>

700
00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:11.860
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a race to the bottom,</v>

701
00:37:11.861 --> 00:37:14.890
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it's so interesting because you</v>

702
00:37:14.891 --> 00:37:15.724
<v Speaker 2>see the fire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the destructive fire in the middle and </v>

703
00:37:17.171 --> 00:37:19.810
<v Speaker 2>then on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well those are crematoriums,</v>

704
00:37:19.811 --> 00:37:20.644
<v Speaker 2>I believe they're from Auschwitz and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that those are the remnants of the </v>

705
00:37:23.110 --> 00:37:27.370
<v Speaker 2>destroyed bodies in the ovens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

706
00:37:27.371 --> 00:37:30.280
<v Speaker 2>all of that death and destruction was </v>
<v Speaker 2>being projected.</v>

707
00:37:30.281 --> 00:37:31.114
<v Speaker 2>In some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the evil was being projected on to </v>

708
00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:36.940
<v Speaker 2>the communists and the Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

709
00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:38.793
<v Speaker 2>that allowed the exactly the same thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>to manifest itself in actuality in </v>

710
00:37:42.881 --> 00:37:47.881
<v Speaker 2>Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the laying out of the body.</v>

711
00:37:51.111 --> 00:37:55.060
<v Speaker 2>So on the left and then that's Hitler </v>
<v Speaker 2>closer to the end of the war.</v>

712
00:37:55.061 --> 00:37:58.330
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's looking pretty haggard and</v>

713
00:38:00.250 --> 00:38:03.430
<v Speaker 2>his mouth is down and his countenance </v>
<v Speaker 2>has fallen,</v>

714
00:38:03.431 --> 00:38:06.640
<v Speaker 2>which is a phrase that we'll encounter </v>
<v Speaker 2>next week.</v>

715
00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:10.093
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

716
00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:14.090
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see this image of Hitler on the left</v>

717
00:38:14.091 --> 00:38:14.924
<v Speaker 2>and he sort of friend to children with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the mother looking on happily in the </v>

718
00:38:18.051 --> 00:38:18.884
<v Speaker 2>back and everybody's smiling and happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then in the middle you see someone </v>

719
00:38:21.801 --> 00:38:24.620
<v Speaker 2>who's been burned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that happened when the</v>

720
00:38:24.621 --> 00:38:28.400
<v Speaker 2>Nazis marched the Jews out of the camps </v>
<v Speaker 2>when the allies were coming is now,</v>

721
00:38:28.401 --> 00:38:31.310
<v Speaker 2>and then they'd put a bunch of people in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the barn and light it on fire.</v>

722
00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:33.740
<v Speaker 2>And I believe that that's an image from </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

723
00:38:34.490 --> 00:38:37.090
<v Speaker 2>And then that's prisoner at the bottom </v>
<v Speaker 2>from one of the,</v>

724
00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:40.360
<v Speaker 2>who didn't die from one of the Holocaust</v>
<v Speaker 2>counts.</v>

725
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.170
<v Speaker 2>So I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

726
00:38:44.171 --> 00:38:46.180
<v Speaker 2>the problem with the image on the last</v>

727
00:38:47.050 --> 00:38:47.480
<v Speaker 3>okay</v>

728
00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:50.450
<v Speaker 2>is that it doesn't factor in the image </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the middle.</v>

729
00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:53.730
<v Speaker 2>And that's the thing about propaganda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

730
00:38:53.731 --> 00:38:55.380
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all good.</v>

731
00:38:55.381 --> 00:38:56.214
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

732
00:38:56.220 --> 00:38:57.053
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if it's presenting itself as all </v>

733
00:38:58.711 --> 00:39:01.080
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you got to ask yourself,</v>

734
00:39:01.081 --> 00:39:02.610
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where's the snake?</v>

735
00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:04.133
<v Speaker 2>Cause there's always a snake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would say the more [inaudible] </v>

736
00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:10.530
<v Speaker 2>represents itself as pure good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bigger the snake.</v>

737
00:39:11.130 --> 00:39:11.963
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dostoyevsky knew that when he started </v>

738
00:39:13.951 --> 00:39:17.940
<v Speaker 2>writing anti utopian anti Utopian ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in notes from underground,</v>

739
00:39:17.941 --> 00:39:21.150
<v Speaker 2>he'd already figured out that if someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>was promising you haven't,</v>

740
00:39:21.151 --> 00:39:25.080
<v Speaker 2>that the probability that there was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hell lurking in there somewhere was,</v>

741
00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:26.273
<v Speaker 2>well it was 100% so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and part of the reason that I've been </v>

742
00:39:29.401 --> 00:39:33.130
<v Speaker 2>working on the ideas in this book and </v>
<v Speaker 2>presenting them to people for so long is</v>

743
00:39:33.131 --> 00:39:33.964
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to inoculate people against </v>
<v Speaker 2>the temptations of Utopian thinking and </v>

744
00:39:37.591 --> 00:39:38.424
<v Speaker 2>propaganda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you should always be asking </v>

745
00:39:39.931 --> 00:39:42.270
<v Speaker 2>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where's the other half?</v>

746
00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:44.310
<v Speaker 2>If nature is all beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

747
00:39:44.311 --> 00:39:46.410
<v Speaker 2>what about the destructive part?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want,</v>

748
00:39:46.411 --> 00:39:48.720
<v Speaker 2>if you're offering a utopia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

749
00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:49.613
<v Speaker 2>aren't you also a devil in a tyrant?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what are you going to do with that </v>

750
00:39:52.771 --> 00:39:53.604
<v Speaker 2>part?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have what what you're gonna do is </v>

751
00:39:54.691 --> 00:39:55.321
<v Speaker 2>you're going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

752
00:39:55.321 --> 00:39:58.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm not the devil on the tire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's those people over there.</v>

753
00:39:58.830 --> 00:39:59.663
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which only proves that you are in fact </v>

754
00:40:00.811 --> 00:40:01.644
<v Speaker 2>both the devil and the tyrant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's much easier for people to put </v>

755
00:40:04.681 --> 00:40:06.600
<v Speaker 2>that out somewhere else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

756
00:40:06.601 --> 00:40:08.070
<v Speaker 2>because do you really want to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>

757
00:40:08.071 --> 00:40:08.904
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you said at the beginning of the class </v>

758
00:40:09.871 --> 00:40:10.704
<v Speaker 2>you wrote out what horrible things might</v>
<v Speaker 2>happen to you if you didn't behave </v>

759
00:40:13.111 --> 00:40:13.944
<v Speaker 2>properly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's unsettling because you have </v>

760
00:40:15.811 --> 00:40:20.010
<v Speaker 2>to recognize in yourself the capacity to</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring something like that about.</v>

761
00:40:20.130 --> 00:40:20.963
<v Speaker 2>It's even worse than that because people</v>
<v Speaker 2>can bring that sort of thing about and </v>

762
00:40:23.461 --> 00:40:25.590
<v Speaker 2>really enjoy it while it's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

763
00:40:25.591 --> 00:40:29.130
<v Speaker 2>in a really corrupt and destructive way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a revenge.</v>

764
00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:32.580
<v Speaker 2>They're looking for revenge and if they </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to take it on themselves,</v>

765
00:40:32.610 --> 00:40:35.130
<v Speaker 2>that's no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just makes the revenge even sweeter.</v>

766
00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:39.673
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

767
00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:42.670
<v Speaker 2>So there's juxtapositions again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

768
00:40:42.671 --> 00:40:43.504
<v Speaker 2>so I've got the crowd that surrounding </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hitler all happy at the dinner table </v>

769
00:40:46.271 --> 00:40:47.104
<v Speaker 2>there on the left and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's cartloads of bodies that were </v>

770
00:40:49.871 --> 00:40:52.660
<v Speaker 2>taken away from the concentration </v>
<v Speaker 2>council and the allies came in.</v>

771
00:40:55.170 --> 00:40:57.750
<v Speaker 2>So there's the tyrannical father and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

772
00:40:58.110 --> 00:41:00.690
<v Speaker 2>and the positive for other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

773
00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:10.993
<v Speaker 2>not I believe is from Nuremberg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although I'm not absolutely certain </v>

774
00:41:13.461 --> 00:41:14.294
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Nuremberg was the place where the </v>

775
00:41:15.321 --> 00:41:17.600
<v Speaker 2>massive Nazi spectacles were held.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

776
00:41:17.601 --> 00:41:20.630
<v Speaker 2>when you can see the Greek and Roman </v>
<v Speaker 2>symbolism there,</v>

777
00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:21.743
<v Speaker 2>like the classical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea that it was a reestablishment </v>

778
00:41:23.931 --> 00:41:28.931
<v Speaker 2>of our enlightened classical society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brilliant use of light against dark,</v>

779
00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:30.013
<v Speaker 2>which something was something that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nazi as the beats were good at the use </v>

780
00:41:34.711 --> 00:41:38.010
<v Speaker 2>of fire and light and black,</v>
<v Speaker 2>white and red contrast.</v>

781
00:41:38.011 --> 00:41:39.720
<v Speaker 2>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very powerful imagery.</v>

782
00:42:11.250 --> 00:42:12.083
<v Speaker 2>I would say literature does great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Literature does because it presents </v>

783
00:42:18.011 --> 00:42:21.880
<v Speaker 2>people as the battleground between chaos</v>
<v Speaker 2>and order in good and evil,</v>

784
00:42:22.690 --> 00:42:23.860
<v Speaker 2>every person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

785
00:42:23.861 --> 00:42:26.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone might be tilted towards the good</v>

786
00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:30.880
<v Speaker 2>and in a great piece of literature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're not,</v>

787
00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:34.330
<v Speaker 2>they're not comic book Superhero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

788
00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:35.493
<v Speaker 2>and I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even the comic books when they were DC </v>

789
00:42:37.781 --> 00:42:39.610
<v Speaker 2>comic books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was pretty damn clear.</v>

790
00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:41.440
<v Speaker 2>Superman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was all good.</v>

791
00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:42.333
<v Speaker 2>The evils evil villains,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were all villainous when the </v>

792
00:42:45.341 --> 00:42:47.090
<v Speaker 2>marvel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

793
00:42:48.490 --> 00:42:51.460
<v Speaker 2>what would you call mythologist sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>emerged in the 1960s.</v>

794
00:42:51.461 --> 00:42:54.460
<v Speaker 2>All the characters became more nuanced </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

795
00:42:54.461 --> 00:42:58.060
<v Speaker 2>they're more palatable to I would say a </v>
<v Speaker 2>a martyred mind.</v>

796
00:42:58.061 --> 00:43:01.060
<v Speaker 2>But also of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>older people are paying attention to the</v>

797
00:43:01.061 --> 00:43:01.894
<v Speaker 2>comic book characters now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not for before they were for </v>

798
00:43:03.881 --> 00:43:05.560
<v Speaker 2>like 10 year olds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

799
00:43:05.561 --> 00:43:06.394
<v Speaker 2>so they like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they couldn't handle the complexity of </v>

800
00:43:08.531 --> 00:43:10.630
<v Speaker 2>something that was more than one thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the same time.</v>

801
00:43:11.130 --> 00:43:11.963
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like if you look at great </v>

802
00:43:13.991 --> 00:43:14.824
<v Speaker 2>literature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the heroes are often 51% good and 49% </v>

803
00:43:21.070 --> 00:43:21.940
<v Speaker 2>evil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

804
00:43:21.941 --> 00:43:26.770
<v Speaker 2>and there's a tremendous battle going on</v>
<v Speaker 2>inside them and outside of them.</v>

805
00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:30.460
<v Speaker 2>And so that makes it a lot more nuanced </v>
<v Speaker 2>and complex,</v>

806
00:43:30.461 --> 00:43:33.580
<v Speaker 2>but it's also in some ways much more </v>
<v Speaker 2>frustrating to read.</v>

807
00:43:34.390 --> 00:43:35.223
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I would say the greater the </v>

808
00:43:37.511 --> 00:43:38.344
<v Speaker 2>literature and the more it approximates </v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't the more balanced the portrayal </v>

809
00:43:42.551 --> 00:43:45.850
<v Speaker 2>of the entire scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have the chaos in the background,</v>

810
00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:49.810
<v Speaker 2>you have the positive and negative </v>
<v Speaker 2>feminine and various manners.</v>

811
00:43:49.811 --> 00:43:52.240
<v Speaker 2>You have the tyrant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the secure father,</v>

812
00:43:52.241 --> 00:43:56.230
<v Speaker 2>you have the adversary and the hero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had the whole picture is painted.</v>

813
00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:59.080
<v Speaker 2>You see the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in any great art.</v>

814
00:43:59.950 --> 00:44:01.690
<v Speaker 2>So that's what makes it great.</v>

815
00:44:08.270 --> 00:44:09.290
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly it,</v>

816
00:44:09.291 --> 00:44:10.124
<v Speaker 2>it did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It tilts into either oversimplification </v>

817
00:44:11.961 --> 00:44:13.730
<v Speaker 2>or propaganda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

818
00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:15.500
<v Speaker 2>and it's dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially,</v>

819
00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:18.650
<v Speaker 2>especially when it harnesses the </v>
<v Speaker 2>archetypal forces.</v>

820
00:44:18.651 --> 00:44:19.484
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things that's happened </v>
<v Speaker 2>since Nietzsche announced the death of </v>

821
00:44:22.341 --> 00:44:27.341
<v Speaker 2>God is that political entities have </v>
<v Speaker 2>appropriated the archetypes.</v>

822
00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:28.671
<v Speaker 2>We think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

823
00:44:28.671 --> 00:44:32.790
<v Speaker 2>the gods are still in those archetypes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no getting rid of them.</v>

824
00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:35.760
<v Speaker 2>So the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's going to be using them?</v>

825
00:44:35.761 --> 00:44:37.650
<v Speaker 2>And for what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

826
00:44:37.651 --> 00:44:38.431
<v Speaker 2>cause we think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

827
00:44:38.431 --> 00:44:40.080
<v Speaker 2>we've transcended all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

828
00:44:40.081 --> 00:44:40.914
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

829
00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:43.080
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go see the avengers,</v>

830
00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:46.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you haven't transcended at all.</v>

831
00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:47.213
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're more bone headed about it then </v>

832
00:44:48.301 --> 00:44:49.134
<v Speaker 2>people were 200 years ago because now </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's comic book superheroes instead of </v>

833
00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:54.600
<v Speaker 2>transcendent daddies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

834
00:44:54.601 --> 00:44:57.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't see that as a consumption,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a conceptual improvement.</v>

835
00:44:58.170 --> 00:45:00.870
<v Speaker 2>I see it as a regression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

836
00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:04.020
<v Speaker 2>and that's a general who shot himself to</v>
<v Speaker 2>death.</v>

837
00:45:04.310 --> 00:45:05.550
<v Speaker 2>A Nazi general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

838
00:45:05.551 --> 00:45:10.551
<v Speaker 2>win the victory of the allies was </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain and Hitler by that time.</v>

839
00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:13.020
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

840
00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:18.020
<v Speaker 2>Basically the way Hitler rationalized </v>
<v Speaker 2>his defeat was the Germans let me down,</v>

841
00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:22.410
<v Speaker 2>Berlin should burn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if the Russians come in and rape and</v>

842
00:45:22.411 --> 00:45:25.440
<v Speaker 2>pillage the people who had happens to </v>
<v Speaker 2>deserve it.</v>

843
00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:29.220
<v Speaker 2>So that was his final judgment on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>German people.</v>

844
00:45:29.221 --> 00:45:31.140
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't that there was something wrong</v>
<v Speaker 2>with him,</v>

845
00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:33.450
<v Speaker 2>is that it was that they just failed </v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

846
00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:36.300
<v Speaker 2>And so they weren't up to the glorious </v>
<v Speaker 2>task that he had set them.</v>

847
00:45:36.450 --> 00:45:39.510
<v Speaker 2>And so they deserved all the rack and </v>
<v Speaker 2>ruin that was being visited on them.</v>

848
00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:41.193
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when I look at that and I see what </v>

849
00:45:42.661 --> 00:45:43.494
<v Speaker 2>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hitler shot himself in a bunker far </v>

850
00:45:45.091 --> 00:45:47.510
<v Speaker 2>below ba Berlin when Europe was on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

851
00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:49.500
<v Speaker 2>Thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What makes you think that wasn't what he</v>

852
00:45:49.501 --> 00:45:53.900
<v Speaker 2>was after from the beginning?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one thinks that they think of,</v>

853
00:45:53.901 --> 00:45:55.990
<v Speaker 2>well he know he wanted to build an </v>
<v Speaker 2>empire,</v>

854
00:45:55.991 --> 00:45:58.270
<v Speaker 2>dominate the world and all those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

855
00:45:58.600 --> 00:45:59.890
<v Speaker 2>why would you think that?</v>

856
00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:00.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

857
00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:05.240
<v Speaker 2>there's an old psychoanalytic idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't understand the motivation,</v>

858
00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:09.290
<v Speaker 2>look at the consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in further motivation,</v>

859
00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:11.773
<v Speaker 2>it's extraordinarily intelligent idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can't figure out what someone's </v>

860
00:46:14.221 --> 00:46:15.270
<v Speaker 2>up to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

861
00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:18.570
<v Speaker 2>What happens when they do whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing?</v>

862
00:46:19.550 --> 00:46:20.383
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's utter catastrophe and pain and </v>

863
00:46:22.021 --> 00:46:22.920
<v Speaker 2>ruined,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might think,</v>

864
00:46:22.921 --> 00:46:23.754
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well there was some part of them that </v>

865
00:46:24.121 --> 00:46:25.130
<v Speaker 2>was aiming at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

866
00:46:25.230 --> 00:46:26.063
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to factor out the effects of </v>

867
00:46:27.841 --> 00:46:28.674
<v Speaker 2>random chance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was nothing random about what </v>

868
00:46:31.411 --> 00:46:34.140
<v Speaker 2>Hitler did to Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Quite the contrary.</v>

869
00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:35.970
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you might ask yourself,</v>

870
00:46:35.971 --> 00:46:39.480
<v Speaker 2>why did he open up a two front war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

871
00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:40.493
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't historically ignorant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You kind of knew by that point that </v>

872
00:46:43.051 --> 00:46:46.500
<v Speaker 2>attacking Russia was probably not the </v>
<v Speaker 2>best thing to do if you actually want it</v>

873
00:46:46.501 --> 00:46:47.400
<v Speaker 2>to win the war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

874
00:46:47.401 --> 00:46:48.234
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could say that he was arrogant and </v>

875
00:46:51.150 --> 00:46:54.210
<v Speaker 2>overvalued the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the power of the,</v>

876
00:46:54.270 --> 00:46:55.103
<v Speaker 2>of the Nazi war machine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was two contemptuous of the </v>

877
00:46:57.391 --> 00:46:59.700
<v Speaker 2>Russians and part of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no doubt.</v>

878
00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:01.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

879
00:47:01.350 --> 00:47:04.050
<v Speaker 2>Tell it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But by the same token,</v>

880
00:47:04.051 --> 00:47:04.884
<v Speaker 2>you can't suppress the suspicion that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the darkest parts of him thought that's </v>

881
00:47:10.111 --> 00:47:13.680
<v Speaker 2>the fastest way to rack and ruin the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly produced it.</v>

882
00:47:15.330 --> 00:47:16.163
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

883
00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:16.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

884
00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:21.900
<v Speaker 2>Why assume that the person is aiming for</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they say they're aiming for,</v>

885
00:47:22.511 --> 00:47:23.344
<v Speaker 2>especially if they use means that are as</v>
<v Speaker 2>undeniably evil is anything you could </v>

886
00:47:27.821 --> 00:47:32.821
<v Speaker 2>possibly come across top left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's Stellan.</v>

887
00:47:33.361 --> 00:47:34.194
<v Speaker 2>And so there is an old guy kissing a </v>
<v Speaker 2>statue of Stella and a gold statue of </v>

888
00:47:37.191 --> 00:47:38.970
<v Speaker 2>Stella,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's after the wall fell.</v>

889
00:47:39.350 --> 00:47:41.490
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>installing was an otter monster,</v>

890
00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:43.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he made Hitler into,</v>

891
00:47:43.530 --> 00:47:44.490
<v Speaker 2>he made Hitler</v>

892
00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:49.380
<v Speaker 2>in many ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hitler was a piker compared to style it.</v>

893
00:47:49.650 --> 00:47:50.483
<v Speaker 2>And one of the very final things about </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hitler that's extraordinarily funny in </v>

894
00:47:53.101 --> 00:47:57.360
<v Speaker 2>the worst possible manner is that one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only people he ever trusted,</v>

895
00:47:57.450 --> 00:47:58.283
<v Speaker 2>sorry Stellan one of the people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>only people that still in ever trusted </v>

896
00:48:01.651 --> 00:48:03.990
<v Speaker 2>was Hitler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we prepared,</v>

897
00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:09.020
<v Speaker 2>he failed to prepare the Russian army,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Soviet army for a potential invasion</v>

898
00:48:09.361 --> 00:48:11.820
<v Speaker 2>by the Germans because Hitler said he </v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't invade.</v>

899
00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:14.130
<v Speaker 2>And so when the Germans finally showed </v>
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

900
00:48:14.131 --> 00:48:17.640
<v Speaker 2>they just blew the Russians back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were completely unprepared,</v>

901
00:48:18.030 --> 00:48:18.863
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if the Russians couldn't have had </v>

902
00:48:19.591 --> 00:48:21.750
<v Speaker 2>the Germans freeze to death because of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the winter,</v>

903
00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:26.160
<v Speaker 2>there's little doubt that the Germans </v>
<v Speaker 2>would have overrun the Soviet Union.</v>

904
00:48:26.430 --> 00:48:28.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean the Russians were tough and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>fought like mad,</v>

905
00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:32.070
<v Speaker 2>but they were completely and utterly </v>
<v Speaker 2>unprepared.</v>

906
00:48:33.170 --> 00:48:38.170
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

907
00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:42.970
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what we've been doing now,</v>

908
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:44.010
<v Speaker 2>like we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want,</v>

909
00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:44.853
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of working towards the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're moving up the food chain in some </v>

910
00:48:48.071 --> 00:48:48.904
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we talked about chaos and we talked </v>

911
00:48:50.201 --> 00:48:51.034
<v Speaker 2>about the great mother and now we've </v>
<v Speaker 2>talked about the great father and we're </v>

912
00:48:53.381 --> 00:48:56.380
<v Speaker 2>sort of tilting up towards the final </v>
<v Speaker 2>level of analysis,</v>

913
00:48:56.410 --> 00:48:57.243
<v Speaker 2>which is the relationship between the </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual and the adversary and then </v>

914
00:49:00.311 --> 00:49:04.030
<v Speaker 2>the relationship between both of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the other levels.</v>

915
00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:04.971
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we,</v>

916
00:49:04.971 --> 00:49:05.804
<v Speaker 2>we touched on that a little bit today </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we could see how Hitler was </v>

917
00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:11.590
<v Speaker 2>presented both as great father but also </v>
<v Speaker 2>as you know,</v>

918
00:49:11.650 --> 00:49:12.483
<v Speaker 2>heroic leader into the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see the same thing with style in </v>

919
00:49:14.981 --> 00:49:17.200
<v Speaker 2>there where he's shown us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

920
00:49:17.350 --> 00:49:20.530
<v Speaker 2>leader of the ship of state and he's far</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I'm concerned.</v>

921
00:49:20.531 --> 00:49:22.840
<v Speaker 2>He's nothing different than captain hook</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's a tyrant.</v>

922
00:49:22.841 --> 00:49:25.930
<v Speaker 2>Because he's afraid that he's afraid of </v>
<v Speaker 2>his own mortality.</v>

923
00:49:26.070 --> 00:49:26.903
<v Speaker 2>He is afraid of the fact that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>crocodiles already got a piece of him </v>

924
00:49:29.230 --> 00:49:32.230
<v Speaker 2>and turns them into a tire and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrified of chaos.</v>

925
00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:35.020
<v Speaker 2>Terrified of the positive feminine for </v>
<v Speaker 2>that matter.</v>

926
00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:37.190
<v Speaker 2>And there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

927
00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:39.250
<v Speaker 2>you see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well there's stolen,</v>

928
00:49:39.490 --> 00:49:40.323
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

929
00:49:40.350 --> 00:49:45.070
<v Speaker 2>the farther of all Soviet people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>loving music,</v>

930
00:49:45.790 --> 00:49:48.190
<v Speaker 2>friend to women and children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

931
00:49:48.191 --> 00:49:49.024
<v Speaker 2>and there's a statue of style and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was toppled after the Berlin wall fell </v>

932
00:49:51.731 --> 00:49:52.564
<v Speaker 2>and it's covered with red paint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While you can imagine what that </v>

933
00:49:54.221 --> 00:49:55.054
<v Speaker 2>indicates,</v>

934
00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:59.020
<v Speaker 2>I really liked the one on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that style.</v>

935
00:49:59.100 --> 00:49:59.933
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look at that and I think you could </v>

936
00:50:03.631 --> 00:50:04.464
<v Speaker 2>hardly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you were attempting to build a </v>

937
