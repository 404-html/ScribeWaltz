1
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:05.550
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.780
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to tell you today about a </v>
<v Speaker 2>way of looking at the world that I think</v>

3
00:00:09.781 --> 00:00:13.650
<v Speaker 2>is substantially different from the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>that most people look at the world.</v>

4
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:14.543
<v Speaker 2>And the way I want to tell you about </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at the world today is I think </v>

5
00:00:19.471 --> 00:00:22.260
<v Speaker 2>more inclusive than a standard sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>materialist view.</v>

6
00:00:22.261 --> 00:00:24.210
<v Speaker 2>Like the standard scientific view of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

7
00:00:24.211 --> 00:00:27.390
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that it's made up of familiar objects</v>

8
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.510
<v Speaker 2>and that the world is in essence a </v>
<v Speaker 2>material place.</v>

9
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.823
<v Speaker 2>But there's some very potent limitations</v>
<v Speaker 2>of that viewpoint despite the fact that </v>

10
00:00:37.411 --> 00:00:42.330
<v Speaker 2>it's given us tremendous power and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>limitations are essentially as follows,</v>

11
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.830
<v Speaker 2>the essential materialist view can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell us anything about consciousness,</v>

12
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.310
<v Speaker 2>which is probably the primary fact of </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>

13
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:54.683
<v Speaker 2>Neuroscientists in recent years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mostly in the last decade of being </v>

14
00:00:57.871 --> 00:01:00.060
<v Speaker 2>trying to crack the problem of </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness,</v>

15
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.180
<v Speaker 2>and they have absolutely made no </v>
<v Speaker 2>progress.</v>

16
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.260
<v Speaker 2>They've tried to associate consciousness</v>
<v Speaker 2>with neuronal activity,</v>

17
00:01:07.261 --> 00:01:08.094
<v Speaker 2>but that seems to be an incomplete </v>
<v Speaker 2>answer because there's many forms of </v>

18
00:01:10.591 --> 00:01:11.424
<v Speaker 2>neuronal activity in the brain that </v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't accompanied by consciousness at </v>

19
00:01:13.711 --> 00:01:14.544
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only do neuroscientists understand </v>

20
00:01:17.551 --> 00:01:18.384
<v Speaker 2>virtually nothing about consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they can't even really figure out </v>

21
00:01:20.641 --> 00:01:24.780
<v Speaker 2>what it's function is and they can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand why our brains would go to so</v>

22
00:01:24.781 --> 00:01:28.830
<v Speaker 2>much effort to make us aware of things </v>
<v Speaker 2>when it isn't clear at all,</v>

23
00:01:28.831 --> 00:01:29.664
<v Speaker 2>that awareness is necessary for life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially given that there are many </v>

24
00:01:32.401 --> 00:01:35.250
<v Speaker 2>life forms on the planet that don't seem</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be aware at all.</v>

25
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.970
<v Speaker 2>The standard materialist view is also </v>
<v Speaker 2>insufficient.</v>

26
00:01:38.971 --> 00:01:41.670
<v Speaker 2>Many other ways it's insufficient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Philosophically,</v>

27
00:01:41.671 --> 00:01:45.990
<v Speaker 2>I think as you probably all know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because our conception that portrays the</v>

28
00:01:45.991 --> 00:01:50.190
<v Speaker 2>world is made up of objects is in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>really fundamental way dead.</v>

29
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:51.673
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't seem to have a place in it </v>

30
00:01:52.531 --> 00:01:53.364
<v Speaker 2>for human beings or a place in it for </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning or a mode whereby you might be </v>

31
00:01:57.031 --> 00:01:57.864
<v Speaker 2>able to conceptualize the real existence</v>
<v Speaker 2>of something like an emotion or a dream </v>

32
00:02:00.781 --> 00:02:01.770
<v Speaker 2>or a motivation.</v>

33
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.903
<v Speaker 2>All phenomena which are just as </v>
<v Speaker 2>mysterious to neuroscientists send to </v>

34
00:02:06.151 --> 00:02:09.900
<v Speaker 2>scientists in general has consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

35
00:02:09.901 --> 00:02:13.830
<v Speaker 2>the problem with this seems to be mostly</v>
<v Speaker 2>experiential.</v>

36
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.180
<v Speaker 2>If you have to ask people what they know</v>
<v Speaker 2>more than anything else,</v>

37
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.740
<v Speaker 2>they know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>number one,</v>

38
00:02:19.741 --> 00:02:21.390
<v Speaker 2>that they're conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They know.</v>

39
00:02:21.391 --> 00:02:25.560
<v Speaker 2>Number two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that their internal experiential life is</v>

40
00:02:25.561 --> 00:02:28.050
<v Speaker 2>composed of emotions and motivational </v>
<v Speaker 2>states,</v>

41
00:02:28.051 --> 00:02:28.884
<v Speaker 2>which although not rational in essential</v>
<v Speaker 2>structure are so real and relevant that </v>

42
00:02:33.301 --> 00:02:36.180
<v Speaker 2>virtually everything that people do is </v>
<v Speaker 2>predicated on them.</v>

43
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.673
<v Speaker 2>So our current viewpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 2>despite its ability to give us </v>

44
00:02:41.581 --> 00:02:42.414
<v Speaker 2>tremendous technological power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seems to eradicate from formal </v>

45
00:02:45.241 --> 00:02:46.074
<v Speaker 2>consideration many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many essential experiences that are </v>

46
00:02:49.171 --> 00:02:50.520
<v Speaker 2>vital to life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

47
00:02:50.521 --> 00:02:52.410
<v Speaker 2>even perhaps primary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

48
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to suggest to you today that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an alternative viewpoint.</v>

49
00:02:56.911 --> 00:03:01.911
<v Speaker 2>And I think also it's one that although </v>
<v Speaker 2>you may be hearing about it formally for</v>

50
00:03:02.171 --> 00:03:03.004
<v Speaker 2>the first time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is also something that you know </v>

51
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:05.343
<v Speaker 2>unbelievably deeply how thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago playdough propose that all </v>

52
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.270
<v Speaker 2>knowledge was remembering.</v>

53
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:14.103
<v Speaker 2>And of course we don't believe that </v>
<v Speaker 2>today because we believe we gathered </v>

54
00:03:15.671 --> 00:03:17.980
<v Speaker 2>knowledge as a consequence of contact </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the world.</v>

55
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.190
<v Speaker 2>But you'll see today that the knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I'm going to share with you,</v>

56
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.320
<v Speaker 2>we'll strike a deep chord of </v>
<v Speaker 2>remembering.</v>

57
00:03:23.321 --> 00:03:24.154
<v Speaker 2>And it's because everything that you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>done throughout your life is in one way </v>

58
00:03:26.591 --> 00:03:29.620
<v Speaker 2>or another predicated on what I'm going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to tell you today.</v>

59
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to demonstrate this in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>peculiar way,</v>

60
00:03:32.681 --> 00:03:35.470
<v Speaker 2>I think because I'm going to start by </v>
<v Speaker 2>telling you a story,</v>

61
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.300
<v Speaker 2>and the reason I'm going to do that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>because models of the world that include</v>

62
00:03:40.301 --> 00:03:41.200
<v Speaker 2>phenomena,</v>
<v Speaker 2>light,</v>

63
00:03:41.201 --> 00:03:44.170
<v Speaker 2>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and emotions and motivations and actions</v>

64
00:03:44.171 --> 00:03:45.004
<v Speaker 2>and interactions are generally portrayed</v>
<v Speaker 2>formally in stories and not in </v>

65
00:03:49.751 --> 00:03:50.584
<v Speaker 2>scientific theories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it does turn out to be that stories </v>

66
00:03:53.261 --> 00:03:55.420
<v Speaker 2>themselves have an identifiable </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure,</v>

67
00:03:55.421 --> 00:03:58.120
<v Speaker 2>even a grammar that makes them </v>
<v Speaker 2>comprehensible.</v>

68
00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:59.703
<v Speaker 2>Furthermore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it turns out that even the simplest </v>

69
00:04:01.451 --> 00:04:02.284
<v Speaker 2>stories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if they're elegantly </v>

70
00:04:03.191 --> 00:04:07.660
<v Speaker 2>constructed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have an unbelievably profound underlying</v>

71
00:04:07.661 --> 00:04:08.494
<v Speaker 2>meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can frequently see this most </v>

72
00:04:10.001 --> 00:04:11.710
<v Speaker 2>particularly in children's stories.</v>

73
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.400
<v Speaker 2>So I remember I showed my son when he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was four years old,</v>

74
00:04:15.401 --> 00:04:16.780
<v Speaker 2>the Disney movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pinocchio,</v>

75
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:19.930
<v Speaker 2>which on the surface of it is a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>strange tale,</v>

76
00:04:19.931 --> 00:04:23.260
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a wooden puppet who wants to become</v>

77
00:04:23.261 --> 00:04:24.094
<v Speaker 2>real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he has to rescue his father from the </v>

78
00:04:26.681 --> 00:04:27.514
<v Speaker 2>belly of a whale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A structured that could by no means be </v>

79
00:04:30.461 --> 00:04:31.294
<v Speaker 2>considered rational.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is in fact so surprising and </v>

80
00:04:33.851 --> 00:04:37.390
<v Speaker 2>unexpected that it's remarkable to </v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine that grown men and women,</v>

81
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:38.343
<v Speaker 2>including children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can sit in a movie theater and watch a </v>

82
00:04:41.591 --> 00:04:44.950
<v Speaker 2>story like that unfold without ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking for a second.</v>

83
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.933
<v Speaker 2>That it's absolutely peculiar that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>can be taken in by such a tail and </v>

84
00:04:49.361 --> 00:04:54.361
<v Speaker 2>regard it experientially as real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pinocchio is a deep,</v>

85
00:04:54.611 --> 00:04:55.444
<v Speaker 2>deep story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has echoes that go back three or </v>

86
00:04:57.491 --> 00:04:58.324
<v Speaker 2>4,000 years to the earliest stories that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know and it's so rich with </v>

87
00:05:00.761 --> 00:05:04.810
<v Speaker 2>information that a child can watch it </v>
<v Speaker 2>over and over and over and over.</v>

88
00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.830
<v Speaker 2>I think my son Watched Pinocchio 30 </v>
<v Speaker 2>Times a why?</v>

89
00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.903
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's either because a child can't tell </v>

90
00:05:11.591 --> 00:05:12.424
<v Speaker 2>the difference between fantasy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>reality or it's because there's </v>

91
00:05:15.851 --> 00:05:19.630
<v Speaker 2>something to those stories that's much </v>
<v Speaker 2>more potent than we actually consciously</v>

92
00:05:19.631 --> 00:05:21.400
<v Speaker 2>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's kind of interesting too,</v>

93
00:05:21.401 --> 00:05:22.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you go to a,</v>

94
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:26.170
<v Speaker 2>if you go to a video rental </v>
<v Speaker 2>establishment,</v>

95
00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:27.333
<v Speaker 2>you'll find that in the top 10 highest </v>
<v Speaker 2>grossing movies of all time are for </v>

96
00:05:30.581 --> 00:05:32.830
<v Speaker 2>Disney movies that are animated </v>
<v Speaker 2>fairytales,</v>

97
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.380
<v Speaker 2>essentially retelling of mythological </v>
<v Speaker 2>stories.</v>

98
00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.380
<v Speaker 2>They strike a deep chord.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

99
00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:40.323
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shakespeare was of course a great </v>

100
00:05:41.501 --> 00:05:42.334
<v Speaker 2>literary figure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>said it perhaps better than anyone else </v>

101
00:05:45.251 --> 00:05:46.084
<v Speaker 2>has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is not surprising cause he said </v>

102
00:05:47.351 --> 00:05:48.184
<v Speaker 2>many things better than anyone else has.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said all the world's a stage and all </v>

103
00:05:51.581 --> 00:05:53.080
<v Speaker 2>the men and women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>merely players,</v>

104
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.943
<v Speaker 2>they have their exits and their </v>
<v Speaker 2>entrances and one man in his time plays </v>

105
00:05:56.771 --> 00:05:57.680
<v Speaker 2>many parts.</v>

106
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.873
<v Speaker 2>And so following from that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can imagine that a story is know </v>

107
00:06:01.791 --> 00:06:02.624
<v Speaker 2>more about the props in the world than a</v>
<v Speaker 2>play that you go see as about the props </v>

108
00:06:07.941 --> 00:06:09.200
<v Speaker 2>on the stage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

109
00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.140
<v Speaker 2>dramas about the manner in which people </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually exist,</v>

110
00:06:12.141 --> 00:06:14.570
<v Speaker 2>the emotions that they feel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the motivational states they encounter,</v>

111
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.420
<v Speaker 2>the problems they have to solve when </v>
<v Speaker 2>they interact with each other.</v>

112
00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:18.493
<v Speaker 2>And the play's the thing from that </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular perspective in which we can </v>

113
00:06:21.711 --> 00:06:22.544
<v Speaker 2>capture those aspects of our experience </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are not only real but essentially </v>

114
00:06:26.751 --> 00:06:27.584
<v Speaker 2>human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to tell you a little story to </v>

115
00:06:29.631 --> 00:06:32.750
<v Speaker 2>begin this off with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a kid story written for children of</v>

116
00:06:32.751 --> 00:06:34.910
<v Speaker 2>about four years of age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's very,</v>

117
00:06:34.911 --> 00:06:37.760
<v Speaker 2>very elegant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried to cut it down for this talk,</v>

118
00:06:37.761 --> 00:06:38.594
<v Speaker 2>but I found I couldn't because it was so</v>
<v Speaker 2>well edited that every single piece of </v>

119
00:06:41.091 --> 00:06:44.780
<v Speaker 2>it had to fit in to make the story </v>
<v Speaker 2>complete and I'm going to show you first</v>

120
00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.280
<v Speaker 2>the structure of the story.</v>

121
00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:47.293
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a very useful diagram in many </v>

122
00:06:51.231 --> 00:06:52.400
<v Speaker 2>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very simple.</v>

123
00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.300
<v Speaker 2>Basically it says this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whenever you're doing anything,</v>

124
00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:00.440
<v Speaker 2>you inhabit a bounded world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you know like for example,</v>

125
00:07:00.441 --> 00:07:01.274
<v Speaker 2>you're sitting here in this lecture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's things you are paying attention </v>

126
00:07:02.661 --> 00:07:03.494
<v Speaker 2>to and things you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I took most of you out of this room </v>

127
00:07:05.181 --> 00:07:09.440
<v Speaker 2>right now and asked you definitively </v>
<v Speaker 2>what color the rug was,</v>

128
00:07:09.441 --> 00:07:11.270
<v Speaker 2>you would know or what color your chair </v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

129
00:07:11.271 --> 00:07:12.104
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or what the person next to you was </v>

130
00:07:13.011 --> 00:07:14.840
<v Speaker 2>wearing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and bless that person happens to be your</v>

131
00:07:14.841 --> 00:07:15.674
<v Speaker 2>husband or your wife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't remember any of those </v>

132
00:07:17.421 --> 00:07:18.254
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that is when you're </v>

133
00:07:19.161 --> 00:07:21.620
<v Speaker 2>in a situation like this and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>attending to a speaker,</v>

134
00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.580
<v Speaker 2>most of the occurrences that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>unfolding around you are irrelevant.</v>

135
00:07:25.581 --> 00:07:28.520
<v Speaker 2>You don't store them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You only focus on certain things.</v>

136
00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:31.310
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you decide what to focus on given</v>

137
00:07:31.311 --> 00:07:32.144
<v Speaker 2>that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is virtually unlimited number of </v>

138
00:07:33.471 --> 00:07:34.610
<v Speaker 2>things to pay attention to.</v>

139
00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:36.263
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

140
00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:37.533
<v Speaker 2>you have to conceive of yourself as </v>
<v Speaker 2>being somewhere always and you have to </v>

141
00:07:41.111 --> 00:07:43.690
<v Speaker 2>conceive of yourself as going somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you could say,</v>

142
00:07:43.691 --> 00:07:46.540
<v Speaker 2>and in a real sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world you inhabit is a journey.</v>

143
00:07:46.541 --> 00:07:51.070
<v Speaker 2>It's a journey from point a to point b,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a journey from what is to what should be</v>

144
00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:52.203
<v Speaker 2>a journey from the place you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is insufficient in some important </v>

145
00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:59.920
<v Speaker 2>manner to a place that in some important</v>
<v Speaker 2>manner is going to be better.</v>

146
00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:02.410
<v Speaker 2>A standard story has exactly that </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure.</v>

147
00:08:02.411 --> 00:08:03.610
<v Speaker 2>Child comes home and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

148
00:08:03.611 --> 00:08:06.310
<v Speaker 2>what happened to you today on the way to</v>
<v Speaker 2>school,</v>

149
00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:07.413
<v Speaker 2>setting up the little narrative </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure and the child will unfold the </v>

150
00:08:09.431 --> 00:08:10.264
<v Speaker 2>sequence of events that he encountered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the stories more interesting than </v>

151
00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:16.810
<v Speaker 2>just a recount of exactly what happened </v>
<v Speaker 2>to him.</v>

152
00:08:16.811 --> 00:08:21.130
<v Speaker 2>It usually involves the encounter with </v>
<v Speaker 2>something unexpected on the way to point</v>

153
00:08:21.131 --> 00:08:25.420
<v Speaker 2>b and a description of the manner in </v>
<v Speaker 2>which that encounter with the unexpected</v>

154
00:08:25.421 --> 00:08:27.820
<v Speaker 2>was resolved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Typical story.</v>

155
00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:29.500
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would you want to know that?</v>

156
00:08:29.501 --> 00:08:31.300
<v Speaker 2>Why would you want to listen to it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

157
00:08:31.301 --> 00:08:35.230
<v Speaker 2>it's because on your journey from point </v>
<v Speaker 2>a to point b,</v>

158
00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:37.960
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of unexpected things always </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen,</v>

159
00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:39.333
<v Speaker 2>and if someone else has encountered </v>
<v Speaker 2>something unexpected and conjured up a </v>

160
00:08:41.981 --> 00:08:42.814
<v Speaker 2>decent solution to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could well be worth your time to </v>

161
00:08:45.281 --> 00:08:46.114
<v Speaker 2>listen</v>

162
00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:49.523
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

163
00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:53.310
<v Speaker 2>Maybe there's a pattern to encountering </v>
<v Speaker 2>unexpected things.</v>

164
00:08:53.311 --> 00:08:56.730
<v Speaker 2>Maybe there's a proper way to encounter </v>
<v Speaker 2>the unexpected.</v>

165
00:08:56.731 --> 00:08:59.970
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's the case that in our </v>
<v Speaker 2>collective wisdom,</v>

166
00:08:59.971 --> 00:09:00.804
<v Speaker 2>as human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've gathered up representations of </v>

167
00:09:03.661 --> 00:09:08.070
<v Speaker 2>ways to encounter the unexpected that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>put forth in our stories.</v>

168
00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.980
<v Speaker 2>How should you face what you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand?</v>

169
00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:13.740
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now I'm going to tell you this story.</v>

170
00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:15.173
<v Speaker 2>It's written for four year old kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I want you to take a look at it for </v>

171
00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:19.224
<v Speaker 2>a moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a different perspective and see if </v>

172
00:09:21.031 --> 00:09:24.540
<v Speaker 2>you can imagine exactly what it is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's saying.</v>

173
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:28.943
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

174
00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:33.480
<v Speaker 2>There's no such thing as a dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

175
00:09:33.481 --> 00:09:34.440
<v Speaker 2>we all know that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

176
00:09:34.441 --> 00:09:37.440
<v Speaker 2>A dragon is a fictitious creature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reptilian,</v>

177
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:42.900
<v Speaker 2>terrible lives forever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>breathes fire hordes,</v>

178
00:09:42.901 --> 00:09:46.620
<v Speaker 2>Gould,</v>
<v Speaker 2>strange combination of attributes.</v>

179
00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:52.160
<v Speaker 2>Why would something terrible and ancient</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold a treasure.</v>

180
00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:00.403
<v Speaker 2>Billy bixby was rather surprised when he</v>
<v Speaker 2>woke up one morning and found a dragon </v>

181
00:10:03.981 --> 00:10:04.814
<v Speaker 2>in his room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a small dragon about the size of </v>

182
00:10:06.681 --> 00:10:11.681
<v Speaker 2>a kitten.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The dragon wagged it's tail happily when</v>

183
00:10:11.961 --> 00:10:13.250
<v Speaker 2>billy patted his head.</v>

184
00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:17.140
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

185
00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:17.921
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

186
00:10:17.921 --> 00:10:18.754
<v Speaker 2>in Chinese mythology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dragon is a positive figure in European </v>

187
00:10:24.101 --> 00:10:24.934
<v Speaker 2>mythology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The dragon is something to face in </v>

188
00:10:26.531 --> 00:10:31.531
<v Speaker 2>combat and destroy or something to face </v>
<v Speaker 2>in combat and build something out of the</v>

189
00:10:32.321 --> 00:10:33.154
<v Speaker 2>pieces left over from the Dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Billy went downstairs to tell his </v>

190
00:10:37.781 --> 00:10:38.614
<v Speaker 2>mother,</v>

191
00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:39.553
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

192
00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:42.890
<v Speaker 2>there's no such thing as a dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Said Billy's mother.</v>

193
00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:43.993
<v Speaker 2>And she said it like she meant it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember once my daughter had a </v>

194
00:10:47.541 --> 00:10:49.760
<v Speaker 2>nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was about four.</v>

195
00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:51.433
<v Speaker 2>This was at the time when she first </v>
<v Speaker 2>started to notice graffiti and litter </v>

196
00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:54.793
<v Speaker 2>and both graffiti and her bothered her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She couldn't understand the motivations </v>

197
00:10:57.711 --> 00:10:58.544
<v Speaker 2>behind the graffiti artists and she </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't like the fact that there was </v>

198
00:11:01.131 --> 00:11:05.540
<v Speaker 2>litter cluttering up the world's order.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason she got sensitive to that</v>

199
00:11:05.541 --> 00:11:08.120
<v Speaker 2>as a child was because children are </v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

200
00:11:08.121 --> 00:11:09.740
<v Speaker 2>really dependent on order.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

201
00:11:09.741 --> 00:11:10.574
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the reason for that is that their </v>

202
00:11:11.361 --> 00:11:13.640
<v Speaker 2>realm of competence is rather </v>
<v Speaker 2>restricted.</v>

203
00:11:13.641 --> 00:11:14.474
<v Speaker 2>So they'd like to see things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mac mass stops a little kids for </v>

204
00:11:16.911 --> 00:11:19.730
<v Speaker 2>example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not happy with you if you play a</v>

205
00:11:19.731 --> 00:11:21.710
<v Speaker 2>game with them and then mess around with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rules of the game.</v>

206
00:11:21.711 --> 00:11:22.700
<v Speaker 2>They don't like that at all.</v>

207
00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:27.350
<v Speaker 2>They think that that's immoral activity </v>
<v Speaker 2>to shake up the structure of the game.</v>

208
00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:30.080
<v Speaker 2>Well anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while she was pondering all this,</v>

209
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:31.063
<v Speaker 2>she uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>came into our bedroom one night and </v>

210
00:11:32.751 --> 00:11:33.590
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dad,</v>

211
00:11:33.591 --> 00:11:35.210
<v Speaker 2>I had a nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we all know,</v>

212
00:11:35.211 --> 00:11:36.380
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nightmares aren't real.</v>

213
00:11:36.381 --> 00:11:38.690
<v Speaker 2>Just like dragons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dreams aren't real.</v>

214
00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:39.763
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which raises the question of why in the </v>

215
00:11:40.851 --> 00:11:41.684
<v Speaker 2>world you'd bother having them six or </v>
<v Speaker 2>seven hours a night every single day of </v>

216
00:11:44.811 --> 00:11:45.644
<v Speaker 2>your life and why they're a recognized </v>
<v Speaker 2>feature of animal behavior all the way </v>

217
00:11:49.161 --> 00:11:52.490
<v Speaker 2>down to the amphibian level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She said,</v>

218
00:11:52.491 --> 00:11:54.790
<v Speaker 2>I dreamt that was a clear flowing </v>
<v Speaker 2>stream,</v>

219
00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:58.660
<v Speaker 2>but in the stream there was all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 2>garbage and it scared me and bothered me</v>

220
00:11:58.661 --> 00:11:59.650
<v Speaker 2>so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I woke up.</v>

221
00:11:59.651 --> 00:12:00.670
<v Speaker 2>So I told her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

222
00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:05.260
<v Speaker 2>close your eyes and imagine the stream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's full of garbage.</v>

223
00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:07.510
<v Speaker 2>What should you do about it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She said,</v>

224
00:12:07.511 --> 00:12:08.344
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should take the garbage out of the </v>

225
00:12:08.861 --> 00:12:09.140
<v Speaker 2>street.</v>

226
00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:09.821
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

227
00:12:09.821 --> 00:12:12.610
<v Speaker 2>so picture this dream,</v>
<v Speaker 2>picture yourself,</v>

228
00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:16.480
<v Speaker 2>cleaning the garbage out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She calmed down and went back to sleep.</v>

229
00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:17.500
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

230
00:12:17.501 --> 00:12:18.334
<v Speaker 2>because dreams concentrate on threat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know that they present threats to </v>

231
00:12:21.821 --> 00:12:22.654
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>threats you haven't been able to deal </v>

232
00:12:23.291 --> 00:12:24.124
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

233
00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:25.053
<v Speaker 2>there's a part of your brain that tracks</v>
<v Speaker 2>threats and it's not really all that </v>

234
00:12:28.271 --> 00:12:29.380
<v Speaker 2>smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In some ways,</v>

235
00:12:29.381 --> 00:12:31.000
<v Speaker 2>all it does is say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

236
00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:32.103
<v Speaker 2>here's the problem and it's waiting for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the rest of your brain to conjure up </v>

237
00:12:34.631 --> 00:12:35.464
<v Speaker 2>some solution to that problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if it doesn't conjure up a solution </v>

238
00:12:38.201 --> 00:12:42.340
<v Speaker 2>and it just presents the problem over </v>
<v Speaker 2>and over and over and over and over.</v>

239
00:12:42.341 --> 00:12:44.650
<v Speaker 2>So people who have posttraumatic stress </v>
<v Speaker 2>disorder,</v>

240
00:12:44.651 --> 00:12:45.484
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who've been really upset by their </v>

241
00:12:47.051 --> 00:12:47.884
<v Speaker 2>contact with something unexpected,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dream about the same tragedy forever </v>

242
00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:52.473
<v Speaker 2>until they solve it and they solve it by</v>
<v Speaker 2>facing it and living it over and over </v>

243
00:12:59.080 --> 00:12:59.980
<v Speaker 2>voluntarily.</v>

244
00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:03.220
<v Speaker 2>So you might think right off the bat </v>
<v Speaker 2>from listening to that little story that</v>

245
00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:06.850
<v Speaker 2>suggesting to your four year old </v>
<v Speaker 2>daughter who's just had a nightmare,</v>

246
00:13:06.851 --> 00:13:07.684
<v Speaker 2>that her fears aren't real and that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dream representation of them isn't real </v>

247
00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:12.003
<v Speaker 2>because it's not tangible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a table might not really be the </v>

248
00:13:14.291 --> 00:13:18.520
<v Speaker 2>best approach to the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you see billy,</v>

249
00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:21.160
<v Speaker 2>he's pretty much got it right right off </v>
<v Speaker 2>the bat,</v>

250
00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:23.620
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The dragon wagged his tail happily.</v>

251
00:13:23.621 --> 00:13:24.454
<v Speaker 2>When billy padded it's head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bailey went downstairs to tell his </v>

252
00:13:27.251 --> 00:13:31.030
<v Speaker 2>mother there's no such thing as a dragon</v>
<v Speaker 2>said billy's mother,</v>

253
00:13:31.031 --> 00:13:36.031
<v Speaker 2>and she said it like she meant it</v>
<v Speaker 2>till there's a dragon in this house.</v>

254
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:37.833
<v Speaker 2>Now the next thing he might wonder is </v>
<v Speaker 2>how often have you actually gone into a </v>

255
00:13:41.021 --> 00:13:41.854
<v Speaker 2>house where there's a dragon?</v>
<v Speaker 2>My guess is if you don't take this </v>

256
00:13:44.711 --> 00:13:45.544
<v Speaker 2>particularly specifically and allow </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself to use your imagination and to </v>

257
00:13:48.821 --> 00:13:49.654
<v Speaker 2>think metaphorically for a moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've all encountered dozens of houses </v>

258
00:13:52.961 --> 00:13:55.930
<v Speaker 2>that were filled right to the rafters </v>
<v Speaker 2>with various dragons,</v>

259
00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:57.063
<v Speaker 2>all of which were being studiously </v>
<v Speaker 2>ignored by the people who inhabited the </v>

260
00:13:59.411 --> 00:14:03.730
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Billy went back to his room and began to</v>

261
00:14:03.731 --> 00:14:06.940
<v Speaker 2>dress the dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>came close to billy in a friendly manner</v>

262
00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:09.070
<v Speaker 2>and wagged his tail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but billy didn't pat it.</v>

263
00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:12.130
<v Speaker 2>If there's no such thing as something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's silly to pat it on the head.</v>

264
00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:18.160
<v Speaker 2>Billy washed his face and hands and went</v>
<v Speaker 2>down to breakfast.</v>

265
00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:20.380
<v Speaker 2>The dragon went along.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was bigger.</v>

266
00:14:20.381 --> 00:14:25.381
<v Speaker 2>Now almost the size of a dog</v>
<v Speaker 2>belly sat down at the table.</v>

267
00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.273
<v Speaker 2>The dragon sat down on the table.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This sort of thing was not usually </v>

268
00:14:32.951 --> 00:14:33.784
<v Speaker 2>permitted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there wasn't much billy's mother </v>

269
00:14:34.931 --> 00:14:35.764
<v Speaker 2>could do about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She'd already said there was no such </v>

270
00:14:37.361 --> 00:14:40.090
<v Speaker 2>thing as a dragon and if there's no such</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

271
00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:42.850
<v Speaker 2>you can't tell it to get down off the </v>
<v Speaker 2>table.</v>

272
00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:48.273
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I sit with friends of mine who</v>
<v Speaker 2>have very young children to eat saint </v>

273
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:56.630
<v Speaker 2>and the children two or three years old </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't sit out the table.</v>

274
00:14:56.631 --> 00:14:57.464
<v Speaker 2>They sit on the table or they run around</v>
<v Speaker 2>the table or they run around the table </v>

275
00:15:00.381 --> 00:15:04.250
<v Speaker 2>and pull things off the table or they </v>
<v Speaker 2>run around the house and pull things off</v>

276
00:15:04.251 --> 00:15:05.084
<v Speaker 2>all the shelves in the house and keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>their parents so busy chasing them </v>

277
00:15:08.541 --> 00:15:10.190
<v Speaker 2>around that they have no time </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever.</v>

278
00:15:10.191 --> 00:15:12.440
<v Speaker 2>Do we interact as adults?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

279
00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:13.453
<v Speaker 2>you have to wonder under those </v>
<v Speaker 2>circumstances whether you're dealing </v>

280
00:15:15.531 --> 00:15:18.740
<v Speaker 2>with a child or a dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>

281
00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:23.980
<v Speaker 2>And you also might wonder whether or not</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dragon is large and unruly.</v>

282
00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:26.173
<v Speaker 2>Precisely because the parents are </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely unwilling to admit that it </v>

283
00:15:28.551 --> 00:15:29.750
<v Speaker 2>actually exists.</v>

284
00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:37.970
<v Speaker 2>Mother made some pancakes for billy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brought the dragon,</v>

285
00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:39.690
<v Speaker 2>ate the mall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mother made some more,</v>

286
00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:40.823
<v Speaker 2>but to drag an eight those two mother </v>
<v Speaker 2>kept making pancakes until she ran out </v>

287
00:15:43.561 --> 00:15:45.870
<v Speaker 2>of batter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Billy only got one of them,</v>

288
00:15:45.871 --> 00:15:47.700
<v Speaker 2>but he said that's all he really wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

289
00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:49.133
<v Speaker 2>one time,</v>

290
00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:50.823
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

291
00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:54.413
<v Speaker 2>an acquaintance of ours in Boston </v>
<v Speaker 2>brought their son over to be Babysat at </v>

292
00:15:58.261 --> 00:15:59.094
<v Speaker 2>our house and his nanny had just been in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a car accident so he was being shunted </v>

293
00:16:02.731 --> 00:16:03.600
<v Speaker 2>from house to house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

294
00:16:03.601 --> 00:16:07.620
<v Speaker 2>his parents went off to work and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he didn't have very good reputation.</v>

295
00:16:07.621 --> 00:16:10.410
<v Speaker 2>This kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was about four and a,</v>

296
00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:14.253
<v Speaker 2>he came over to our house and with his </v>
<v Speaker 2>mother in the morning and she dropped </v>

297
00:16:16.391 --> 00:16:17.320
<v Speaker 2>him off and she said,</v>

298
00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:20.350
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he probably won't eat all day,</v>

299
00:16:20.351 --> 00:16:22.540
<v Speaker 2>but that's all right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh and I thought,</v>

300
00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:25.930
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's four.</v>

301
00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:27.640
<v Speaker 2>If he doesn't eat all day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

302
00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:30.370
<v Speaker 2>that's not all right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

303
00:16:30.371 --> 00:16:31.204
<v Speaker 2>Cause kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they don't eat their basically </v>

304
00:16:32.801 --> 00:16:33.540
<v Speaker 2>horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

305
00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:34.600
<v Speaker 2>If they don't sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't eat.</v>

306
00:16:34.601 --> 00:16:35.434
<v Speaker 2>They're horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it isn't all right that he doesn't </v>

307
00:16:36.911 --> 00:16:37.571
<v Speaker 2>eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then you think,</v>

308
00:16:37.571 --> 00:16:38.404
<v Speaker 2>well maybe there's some sort of dragon </v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with this child that happens </v>

309
00:16:41.621 --> 00:16:44.350
<v Speaker 2>to be interviewing perhaps with his </v>
<v Speaker 2>ability to eat.</v>

310
00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:45.573
<v Speaker 2>So I came back at noon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my wife had taken care of the children </v>

311
00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:48.513
<v Speaker 2>that day and I walked in the house and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the other four or five kids that we had </v>

312
00:16:52.571 --> 00:16:53.404
<v Speaker 2>in house were off playing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this little kid was standing in the </v>

313
00:16:55.541 --> 00:16:57.940
<v Speaker 2>corner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like really isolated and looking,</v>

314
00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:00.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>upset fundamentally.</v>

315
00:17:00.611 --> 00:17:01.444
<v Speaker 2>So I went over and I poked him a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 2>because generally if you poke a kid a </v>

316
00:17:04.181 --> 00:17:05.014
<v Speaker 2>little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

317
00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:06.610
<v Speaker 2>well they'll go like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

318
00:17:06.611 --> 00:17:07.444
<v Speaker 2>the sort of back off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But sooner or later you can crack them </v>

319
00:17:09.731 --> 00:17:11.710
<v Speaker 2>and they'll smile and then they'll play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not this kid,</v>

320
00:17:11.711 --> 00:17:12.544
<v Speaker 2>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no bloody way who's going to </v>

321
00:17:12.971 --> 00:17:13.804
<v Speaker 2>play with me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was like he'd already learned </v>

322
00:17:15.671 --> 00:17:16.504
<v Speaker 2>that adults should either be ignored or </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they were trouble and he wasn't </v>

323
00:17:21.221 --> 00:17:23.200
<v Speaker 2>gonna let any adult into his little </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

324
00:17:23.201 --> 00:17:24.034
<v Speaker 2>So there was absolutely a dragon </v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with that little boy and it </v>

325
00:17:27.071 --> 00:17:28.570
<v Speaker 2>was eating all his pancakes.</v>

326
00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:35.100
<v Speaker 2>Billy went upstairs to brush his teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mother started clearing the table.</v>

327
00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:37.890
<v Speaker 2>The dragon who was quite as big as </v>
<v Speaker 2>mother by this time,</v>

328
00:17:37.891 --> 00:17:40.200
<v Speaker 2>made himself comfortable on the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>rug and went to sleep.</v>

329
00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:46.290
<v Speaker 2>I really like this one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the time billy came back downstairs,</v>

330
00:17:46.291 --> 00:17:48.390
<v Speaker 2>the dragon had grown so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He filled the hall.</v>

331
00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:49.703
<v Speaker 2>Billy had to go around by way of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>living room to get to where his mother </v>

332
00:17:51.961 --> 00:17:52.794
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know dragon's group's who fast </v>

333
00:17:54.811 --> 00:17:57.120
<v Speaker 2>said billy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no such thing as a dragon.</v>

334
00:17:57.121 --> 00:17:58.290
<v Speaker 2>Said mother firmly</v>

335
00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:04.180
<v Speaker 2>cleaning the downstairs took mother all </v>
<v Speaker 2>morning.</v>

336
00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:09.520
<v Speaker 2>Well with the dragon in the way and </v>
<v Speaker 2>having to climb in and out of windows to</v>

337
00:18:09.521 --> 00:18:11.680
<v Speaker 2>get from room to room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

338
00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:13.473
<v Speaker 2>you think back in your own experience </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you've gone to a house where </v>

339
00:18:15.401 --> 00:18:16.234
<v Speaker 2>there's a dragon hiding underneath the </v>
<v Speaker 2>living room rug and nobody's saying </v>

340
00:18:19.031 --> 00:18:20.980
<v Speaker 2>anything about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you think,</v>

341
00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:26.250
<v Speaker 2>how long does it take to get something </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely simple done in a house that's</v>

342
00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:31.030
<v Speaker 2>absolutely jammed to the rafters with </v>
<v Speaker 2>unfinished business forever,</v>

343
00:18:31.031 --> 00:18:31.864
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Organizing people in a household like </v>

344
00:18:33.341 --> 00:18:34.174
<v Speaker 2>that to even do something as simple as </v>
<v Speaker 2>go out for breakfast in the morning or </v>

345
00:18:36.941 --> 00:18:40.000
<v Speaker 2>even perhaps to make a meal is virtually</v>
<v Speaker 2>impossible.</v>

346
00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:42.100
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

347
00:18:42.101 --> 00:18:42.934
<v Speaker 2>because there's something going on in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the household that has been studiously </v>

348
00:18:46.631 --> 00:18:47.464
<v Speaker 2>ignored for a very long time and has </v>
<v Speaker 2>grown so large as a consequence that it </v>

349
00:18:51.701 --> 00:18:56.701
<v Speaker 2>occupies the whole domain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By noon,</v>

350
00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:02.200
<v Speaker 2>the dragon filled the house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's head hung out the front door.</v>

351
00:19:02.201 --> 00:19:03.034
<v Speaker 2>It's tail hung out the back door and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't a room in the house that </v>

352
00:19:05.501 --> 00:19:07.360
<v Speaker 2>didn't have some part of the dragon in </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

353
00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:17.140
<v Speaker 2>When the dragon awoke from his nap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was hungry.</v>

354
00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:18.873
<v Speaker 2>You Bake for truck went by.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The smell of fresh bread was more than </v>

355
00:19:20.921 --> 00:19:21.754
<v Speaker 2>the dragon could resist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He ran down the street after the bakery </v>

356
00:19:24.041 --> 00:19:25.750
<v Speaker 2>truck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The house went along.</v>

357
00:19:25.751 --> 00:19:27.460
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the shell on a snail.</v>

358
00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:39.880
<v Speaker 2>The mailman was just coming up the path </v>
<v Speaker 2>with some mail for the big speeds.</v>

359
00:19:39.881 --> 00:19:43.750
<v Speaker 2>When their house rushed past him and </v>
<v Speaker 2>headed down the street,</v>

360
00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:45.700
<v Speaker 2>he chased the big space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How has for a few blocks,</v>

361
00:19:45.701 --> 00:19:47.200
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he couldn't catch it.</v>

362
00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:50.983
<v Speaker 2>When mister bixby came home for lunch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first thing he noticed was that his </v>

363
00:19:54.351 --> 00:19:58.640
<v Speaker 2>house was gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Luckily one of the neighbors was able to</v>

364
00:19:58.641 --> 00:20:00.420
<v Speaker 2>tell them which way it went.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

365
00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:04.280
<v Speaker 2>that sort of thing happens to people not</v>
<v Speaker 2>infrequently to write,</v>

366
00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:05.173
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not really looking around much </v>

367
00:20:07.161 --> 00:20:07.994
<v Speaker 2>at what's going on and they come home </v>
<v Speaker 2>from work one day and their house is </v>

368
00:20:11.061 --> 00:20:12.500
<v Speaker 2>gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what does that mean?</v>

369
00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:13.423
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe their children have become </v>

370
00:20:15.861 --> 00:20:20.210
<v Speaker 2>completely alienated from them or maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>their wife has decided suddenly,</v>

371
00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:22.880
<v Speaker 2>but of course not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So suddenly to leave.</v>

372
00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:25.580
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

373
00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:26.443
<v Speaker 2>according to this story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's because something ignored was </v>

374
00:20:28.551 --> 00:20:33.551
<v Speaker 2>growing in the house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mr Bixby in his car and went looking for</v>

375
00:20:34.441 --> 00:20:35.274
<v Speaker 2>the house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He studied all the houses as he drove </v>

376
00:20:36.571 --> 00:20:38.760
<v Speaker 2>along.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Finally he saw one that looked familiar.</v>

377
00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:41.820
<v Speaker 2>Billy and Mrs Bixby,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're waving from an upstairs window.</v>

378
00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:43.183
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

379
00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:53.010
<v Speaker 2>You know when in the 1890s in India when</v>
<v Speaker 2>a house was being built,</v>

380
00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:54.473
<v Speaker 2>the local priest equivalent to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>priest would come by to set the </v>

381
00:20:58.441 --> 00:21:01.140
<v Speaker 2>foundation stone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when he set the foundation stone,</v>

382
00:21:01.141 --> 00:21:04.740
<v Speaker 2>he take a big spike and drove it into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ground.</v>

383
00:21:04.741 --> 00:21:07.890
<v Speaker 2>And the reason he drove it into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ground at the place where the foundation</v>

384
00:21:07.891 --> 00:21:08.724
<v Speaker 2>was going to be laid was to keep the </v>
<v Speaker 2>great dragon that is underneath the </v>

385
00:21:11.401 --> 00:21:12.234
<v Speaker 2>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Firmly pinned down by its head so it </v>

386
00:21:14.701 --> 00:21:17.070
<v Speaker 2>couldn't move and shake the house to </v>
<v Speaker 2>bits.</v>

387
00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:18.930
<v Speaker 2>And what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

388
00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:20.333
<v Speaker 2>it means the same thing that's meant in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the new testament when you're told not </v>

389
00:21:22.501 --> 00:21:24.630
<v Speaker 2>to build your house on a foundation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>sand,</v>

390
00:21:24.631 --> 00:21:25.464
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter how good the house is </v>

391
00:21:27.001 --> 00:21:30.030
<v Speaker 2>or how well constructed it is or how </v>
<v Speaker 2>rich it is.</v>

392
00:21:30.031 --> 00:21:34.260
<v Speaker 2>If the foundation has made out of sand </v>
<v Speaker 2>or if it rests on top of a dragon,</v>

393
00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:37.320
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing in that household that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever going to be accomplished.</v>

394
00:21:37.321 --> 00:21:39.600
<v Speaker 2>That's positive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the wealth,</v>

395
00:21:39.601 --> 00:21:43.320
<v Speaker 2>the display that the house might consist</v>
<v Speaker 2>of is nothing but a sham.</v>

396
00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:47.103
<v Speaker 2>Mr Bixby climbed over the dragon's head </v>
<v Speaker 2>onto the porch roof and through the </v>

397
00:21:49.961 --> 00:21:53.860
<v Speaker 2>upstairs window.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did this happen?</v>

398
00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:58.240
<v Speaker 2>Mr Bixby asked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the dragon said,</v>

399
00:21:58.241 --> 00:22:00.850
<v Speaker 2>billy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no such thing.</v>

400
00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:03.150
<v Speaker 2>Mother started to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a dragon.</v>

401
00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:07.690
<v Speaker 2>Billy insisted a very big dragon and </v>
<v Speaker 2>billy patted the dragon on the head.</v>

402
00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:16.650
<v Speaker 2>The dragon wagged his tail happily then </v>
<v Speaker 2>even faster than it had grown.</v>

403
00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:21.860
<v Speaker 2>The dragon started getting smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Soon it was kitten size again.</v>

404
00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:31.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't mind dragons this side said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mother,</v>

405
00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:41.330
<v Speaker 2>why did it have to grow so big?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure I said billy,</v>

406
00:22:41.331 --> 00:22:43.340
<v Speaker 2>but I think it just want it to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>noticed.</v>

407
00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:51.053
<v Speaker 2>So the first thing you might think about</v>
<v Speaker 2>is just what happens if you don't pay a </v>

408
00:22:53.191 --> 00:22:55.440
<v Speaker 2>bill?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like really don't pay it.</v>

409
00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:57.420
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean when it first comes in,</v>

410
00:22:57.421 --> 00:22:58.254
<v Speaker 2>it's only the size of a kitten.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you leave it alone for two or </v>

411
00:23:00.571 --> 00:23:01.404
<v Speaker 2>three years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty much grows into a full </v>

412
00:23:02.581 --> 00:23:03.880
<v Speaker 2>fledge dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

413
00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:05.190
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

414
00:23:05.191 --> 00:23:09.270
<v Speaker 2>because things that you ignore have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>life of their own complex life,</v>

415
00:23:09.271 --> 00:23:13.590
<v Speaker 2>like a bill bills attached to a whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>industrial complex,</v>

416
00:23:13.591 --> 00:23:14.424
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of whose major functions is to make </v>

417
00:23:16.681 --> 00:23:19.560
<v Speaker 2>sure that you pay the bill and if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't pay the bill,</v>

418
00:23:19.561 --> 00:23:22.380
<v Speaker 2>then you immediately find out what it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>connected to.</v>

419
00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:24.600
<v Speaker 2>It's connected to something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Manson,</v>

420
00:23:24.601 --> 00:23:25.434
<v Speaker 2>very troublesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you allow all the full force of </v>

421
00:23:27.121 --> 00:23:29.430
<v Speaker 2>that thing to manifest itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not pretty.</v>

422
00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:35.900
<v Speaker 2>So one lesson from this story is that if</v>
<v Speaker 2>something's nagging at you just a bit,</v>

423
00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:40.103
<v Speaker 2>it's probably better to deal with it </v>
<v Speaker 2>before it turns into a full fledge </v>

424
00:23:42.551 --> 00:23:43.200
<v Speaker 2>dragon.</v>

425
00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:44.040
<v Speaker 2>And then you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

426
00:23:44.041 --> 00:23:46.280
<v Speaker 2>what if it's already full fledge dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

427
00:23:46.281 --> 00:23:47.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then what's your option?</v>

428
00:23:47.431 --> 00:23:49.640
<v Speaker 2>And this is there is nothing left but to</v>
<v Speaker 2>run away.</v>

429
00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:54.680
<v Speaker 2>And so then I can tell you what we know </v>
<v Speaker 2>from 50 years of studying the outcome of</v>

430
00:23:54.681 --> 00:23:58.670
<v Speaker 2>clinical psychological interventions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's take an extreme case,</v>

431
00:23:58.671 --> 00:23:59.504
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say something truly terrible has </v>

432
00:24:01.131 --> 00:24:03.230
<v Speaker 2>happened to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as a consequence of that,</v>

433
00:24:03.231 --> 00:24:08.231
<v Speaker 2>you're in shock post traumatic shock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a condition that's sufficiently</v>

434
00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:13.370
<v Speaker 2>serious to damage your brain over time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not only a psychological disorder,</v>

435
00:24:13.371 --> 00:24:15.650
<v Speaker 2>it's a physical disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're really stressed,</v>

436
00:24:15.651 --> 00:24:19.550
<v Speaker 2>your cortisol levels shoot up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if your cortisol level shoot up that</v>

437
00:24:19.551 --> 00:24:21.860
<v Speaker 2>cortisol and high dose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a neurotoxin,</v>

438
00:24:21.861 --> 00:24:22.694
<v Speaker 2>it starts to damage your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's take a very extreme case and </v>

439
00:24:25.551 --> 00:24:28.940
<v Speaker 2>imagine that you've been violently </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexually assaulted.</v>

440
00:24:28.941 --> 00:24:31.520
<v Speaker 2>And as a consequence of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in post traumatic shock.</v>

441
00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:32.563
<v Speaker 2>How do you get cured?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that means you can't really go </v>

442
00:24:34.761 --> 00:24:35.594
<v Speaker 2>outside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You certainly can't encounter anything </v>

443
00:24:36.501 --> 00:24:37.334
<v Speaker 2>that's associated with the event.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your sense of integrity and personal </v>

444
00:24:40.251 --> 00:24:41.084
<v Speaker 2>safety of being completely destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there any way you can get back on </v>

445
00:24:44.091 --> 00:24:44.924
<v Speaker 2>your feet and all?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a woman named Edna Foa in New </v>

446
00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:48.943
<v Speaker 2>York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think one of the world's top clinical </v>

447
00:24:49.881 --> 00:24:50.714
<v Speaker 2>psychologist and she's been dealing with</v>
<v Speaker 2>women who have post traumatic stress </v>

448
00:24:53.001 --> 00:24:53.834
<v Speaker 2>disorder for decades and she's found a </v>
<v Speaker 2>treatment that works and the treatment </v>

449
00:25:00.441 --> 00:25:03.980
<v Speaker 2>is this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She has the women relive the event in as</v>

450
00:25:03.981 --> 00:25:04.814
<v Speaker 2>much detail as possible over and over in</v>
<v Speaker 2>their imagination with the accompanying </v>

451
00:25:09.351 --> 00:25:10.184
<v Speaker 2>emotion and she's found because she's </v>
<v Speaker 2>done physiological measurements on her </v>

452
00:25:12.711 --> 00:25:13.544
<v Speaker 2>clients,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that those women that allow themselves </v>

453
00:25:14.751 --> 00:25:19.040
<v Speaker 2>to get the most fully upset as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequence of the reliving get better,</v>

454
00:25:19.041 --> 00:25:19.874
<v Speaker 2>faster and stay better longer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The clinical evidence is absolutely </v>

455
00:25:23.571 --> 00:25:25.940
<v Speaker 2>clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you take someone to therapy,</v>

456
00:25:25.941 --> 00:25:27.890
<v Speaker 2>you're basically doing two things to </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

457
00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:29.060
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>

458
00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:29.893
<v Speaker 2>you allow them to confess what's wrong </v>
<v Speaker 2>with them because it's really useful to </v>

459
00:25:31.971 --> 00:25:34.250
<v Speaker 2>actually say what it is that's bothering</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

460
00:25:34.251 --> 00:25:35.084
<v Speaker 2>It makes it clear and distinct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You help the person get their story </v>

461
00:25:40.001 --> 00:25:41.690
<v Speaker 2>straight because you have to have your </v>
<v Speaker 2>story straight,</v>

462
00:25:41.691 --> 00:25:42.524
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to know where you're coming </v>

463
00:25:43.071 --> 00:25:43.904
<v Speaker 2>from and you have to know where you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going because otherwise there's no </v>

464
00:25:45.591 --> 00:25:46.424
<v Speaker 2>structure for your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the third thing is if your path </v>

465
00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:55.190
<v Speaker 2>from point a to b is being blocked by </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that you're afraid of,</v>

466
00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:58.160
<v Speaker 2>you better learn to confront it because </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't,</v>

467
00:25:58.970 --> 00:25:59.803
<v Speaker 2>it will grow and expand until it turns </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the kind of dragon that occupies </v>

468
00:26:03.501 --> 00:26:04.340
<v Speaker 2>your whole house.</v>

469
00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:14.460
<v Speaker 2>This is another representation of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>story that's a simple story.</v>

470
00:26:14.461 --> 00:26:17.950
<v Speaker 2>I think it's one that's really most </v>
<v Speaker 2>applicable to children at.</v>

471
00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:23.110
<v Speaker 2>There are aspects of it that are most </v>
<v Speaker 2>applicable to children.</v>

472
00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:25.060
<v Speaker 2>Sexual desire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One obviously isn't.</v>

473
00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:26.223
<v Speaker 2>It's a map of motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It basically says this and it's easy to </v>

474
00:26:28.811 --> 00:26:30.880
<v Speaker 2>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you think go to a movie,</v>

475
00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:32.470
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter what country it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>made.</v>

476
00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:34.840
<v Speaker 2>There's certain things that always </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen,</v>

477
00:26:34.841 --> 00:26:37.240
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like two broad classes of fiction,</v>

478
00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:38.133
<v Speaker 2>adventure and romance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's an adventure to go to new lands </v>

479
00:26:40.901 --> 00:26:43.770
<v Speaker 2>and discover something new and become </v>
<v Speaker 2>transformed a consequence.</v>

480
00:26:43.771 --> 00:26:44.604
<v Speaker 2>What's a romance to meet another person </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's certainly as complicated as </v>

481
00:26:48.031 --> 00:26:51.210
<v Speaker 2>anything you could meet on an adventure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

482
00:26:51.211 --> 00:26:55.410
<v Speaker 2>to be transformed as a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the contact to fundamental plots.</v>

483
00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:56.453
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are there fundamental plots and why </v>

484
00:26:59.581 --> 00:27:02.300
<v Speaker 2>can we understand them without them </v>
<v Speaker 2>being explained to us what it's,</v>

485
00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:05.010
<v Speaker 2>because fundamentally we're all very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very similar.</v>

486
00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:09.570
<v Speaker 2>We have a finite set of basic needs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

487
00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:11.003
<v Speaker 2>hot people would rather be cool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thirsty people would rather have water </v>

488
00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:16.710
<v Speaker 2>hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people would rather eat.</v>

489
00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:20.700
<v Speaker 2>And these motivations color what we </v>
<v Speaker 2>conceive of as our ultimate destiny.</v>

490
00:27:20.701 --> 00:27:22.350
<v Speaker 2>So in the Old Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

491
00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:23.573
<v Speaker 2>an agrarian community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>often hungry paradise was construed as </v>

492
00:27:26.881 --> 00:27:28.620
<v Speaker 2>the land of milk and honey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

493
00:27:28.621 --> 00:27:29.610
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

494
00:27:29.611 --> 00:27:33.090
<v Speaker 2>milk is high in fat and honey is high in</v>
<v Speaker 2>glucose.</v>

495
00:27:33.091 --> 00:27:34.800
<v Speaker 2>And if you're hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really hungry,</v>

496
00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:38.040
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing you want more than fat </v>
<v Speaker 2>and sugar.</v>

497
00:27:41.530 --> 00:27:43.840
<v Speaker 2>Affiliative desire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we like to be around other people,</v>

498
00:27:43.841 --> 00:27:44.674
<v Speaker 2>sexual desire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fundamental sub element of a romantic </v>

499
00:27:47.531 --> 00:27:48.364
<v Speaker 2>plot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These underlying motivational systems </v>

500
00:27:49.991 --> 00:27:54.991
<v Speaker 2>have ours set us up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bounded world within which we live.</v>

501
00:27:55.121 --> 00:27:57.820
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you fall in love with someone and you</v>

502
00:27:57.821 --> 00:28:00.070
<v Speaker 2>construe your destiny as being with </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

503
00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:01.353
<v Speaker 2>any indication that they're pleased with</v>
<v Speaker 2>you is going to produce a rash of </v>

504
00:28:04.871 --> 00:28:06.370
<v Speaker 2>positive emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

505
00:28:06.610 --> 00:28:07.443
<v Speaker 2>Because our emotional systems are set up</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that any sign that we're moving </v>

506
00:28:10.631 --> 00:28:15.631
<v Speaker 2>towards our goal is responded to with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>rush of positive emotion and conversely,</v>

507
00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:17.163
<v Speaker 2>a frown from the person that you love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in the initial ages of an </v>

508
00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:25.600
<v Speaker 2>initial stages of a romance is met with </v>
<v Speaker 2>a flood of negative effect.</v>

509
00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:26.943
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

510
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.560
<v Speaker 2>Because anything that stops us on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>path that we've chosen produces negative</v>

511
00:28:33.561 --> 00:28:34.394
<v Speaker 2>emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how we're set up and our </v>

512
00:28:36.081 --> 00:28:38.390
<v Speaker 2>emotional systems are actually quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>straight forward.</v>

513
00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:39.590
<v Speaker 2>We pause it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A goal.</v>

514
00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:42.800
<v Speaker 2>The thing about people is that we can </v>
<v Speaker 2>pause it virtually anything as a goal.</v>

515
00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:45.590
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>distinguishes us from animals,</v>

516
00:28:45.591 --> 00:28:46.424
<v Speaker 2>so we can all be thrilled to death when </v>
<v Speaker 2>our favorite soccer team scores a goal </v>

517
00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:51.380
<v Speaker 2>because we participate in what they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

518
00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:56.060
<v Speaker 2>The same way we participate in watching </v>
<v Speaker 2>a protagonist on a movie or in a book,</v>

519
00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:58.070
<v Speaker 2>we can feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We embody it.</v>

520
00:28:58.100 --> 00:28:58.933
<v Speaker 2>We even know now that the neural systems</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I utilize to watch a movie involve </v>

521
00:29:03.801 --> 00:29:06.740
<v Speaker 2>the same neural systems that the actor </v>
<v Speaker 2>is utilizing,</v>

522
00:29:06.741 --> 00:29:07.574
<v Speaker 2>acting out the part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you say you understand someone </v>

523
00:29:09.681 --> 00:29:10.514
<v Speaker 2>else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you mean is your body is set to do </v>

524
00:29:13.221 --> 00:29:14.450
<v Speaker 2>exactly the same thing.</v>

525
00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:15.283
<v Speaker 2>Their body is and your emotional systems</v>
<v Speaker 2>are locked on exactly the same way </v>

526
00:29:18.471 --> 00:29:19.304
<v Speaker 2>there's are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when they experience something and </v>

527
00:29:20.201 --> 00:29:22.550
<v Speaker 2>you're watching it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you experienced an echo of it.</v>

528
00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:23.533
<v Speaker 2>And that's what understanding means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it turns out as well that those </v>

529
00:29:26.361 --> 00:29:27.194
<v Speaker 2>neural systems that allow us to embody </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone else and to imitate them are </v>

530
00:29:31.071 --> 00:29:35.120
<v Speaker 2>right underneath the structures that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we've evolved to use for language.</v>

531
00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:36.073
<v Speaker 2>And what that indicates is that mostly </v>
<v Speaker 2>what we use language for is to tell </v>

532
00:29:39.591 --> 00:29:43.960
<v Speaker 2>stories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to tell about the way that people act so</v>

533
00:29:43.961 --> 00:29:46.930
<v Speaker 2>that we can derive information not about</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the world's made of.</v>

534
00:29:46.931 --> 00:29:49.660
<v Speaker 2>Cause we don't really care about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>some fundamental way,</v>

535
00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:52.540
<v Speaker 2>but instead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how should we act?</v>

536
00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:56.200
<v Speaker 2>That's the fundamental question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How should we act now?</v>

537
00:29:56.201 --> 00:30:01.201
<v Speaker 2>If you go see a movie about a thug,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the message there is given that the thug</v>

538
00:30:02.571 --> 00:30:05.930
<v Speaker 2>generally comes to not so good and don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>act like a thug.</v>

539
00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:07.430
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

540
00:30:07.431 --> 00:30:09.980
<v Speaker 2>Though it might be compelling as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lifestyle,</v>

541
00:30:09.981 --> 00:30:12.050
<v Speaker 2>at least sufficiently compelling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you'll watch it.</v>

542
00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:17.380
<v Speaker 2>It's not a good longterm strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is a good long term strategy?</v>

543
00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:21.073
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've been collecting stories as people </v>

544
00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:24.680
<v Speaker 2>we don't know how long really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't know,</v>

545
00:30:24.770 --> 00:30:28.040
<v Speaker 2>a hundred thousand years maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's being creatures like us,</v>

546
00:30:28.041 --> 00:30:28.874
<v Speaker 2>indistinguishable from us for 100,000 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years and we know that society's that </v>

547
00:30:32.961 --> 00:30:37.670
<v Speaker 2>appear to be more or less as archaic as </v>
<v Speaker 2>those old societies tell stories,</v>

548
00:30:37.671 --> 00:30:39.440
<v Speaker 2>have rituals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have mythology.</v>

549
00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:42.950
<v Speaker 2>We have ancient written stories like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Enuma Elish,</v>

550
00:30:42.951 --> 00:30:44.990
<v Speaker 2>which is a Sumerian story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the oldest written story.</v>

551
00:30:44.991 --> 00:30:45.824
<v Speaker 2>We have 4,000 years old based on a oral </v>
<v Speaker 2>tradition that's probably 20,000 years </v>

552
00:30:51.321 --> 00:30:52.154
<v Speaker 2>older than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've been collecting stories for a </v>

553
00:30:53.331 --> 00:30:54.650
<v Speaker 2>long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>long time.</v>

554
00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:58.260
<v Speaker 1>What do they mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are they good for?</v>

555
00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:00.421
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine this,</v>

556
00:31:00.421 --> 00:31:02.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you tell a story to your husband or your</v>

557
00:31:02.731 --> 00:31:03.330
<v Speaker 2>wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

558
00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:05.460
<v Speaker 2>but something interesting that you saw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

559
00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:06.503
<v Speaker 2>Well then imagine that you could collect</v>
<v Speaker 2>a thousand of the most interesting </v>

560
00:31:09.871 --> 00:31:13.260
<v Speaker 2>stories and then imagine that you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>some kind of literary genius like,</v>

561
00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:14.683
<v Speaker 2>like Shakespeare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you could take those thousand </v>

562
00:31:15.871 --> 00:31:20.871
<v Speaker 2>interesting stories and boil them down </v>
<v Speaker 2>to a hundred really interesting stories.</v>

563
00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:21.953
<v Speaker 2>And then imagine that you had 10,000 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years to gather up those hundred most </v>

564
00:31:25.081 --> 00:31:25.914
<v Speaker 2>interesting stories and average them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you could come out with one perfect </v>

565
00:31:29.221 --> 00:31:30.780
<v Speaker 2>story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best story,</v>

566
00:31:30.781 --> 00:31:33.690
<v Speaker 2>the most interesting story that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could possibly tell.</v>

567
00:31:34.290 --> 00:31:35.430
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what a myth is.</v>

568
00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:38.520
<v Speaker 2>It's the most interesting story you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibly tell.</v>

569
00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:41.160
<v Speaker 2>And just as this little story that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>just told you,</v>

570
00:31:41.161 --> 00:31:43.320
<v Speaker 2>how to an underlying mythological </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure,</v>

571
00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:47.190
<v Speaker 2>virtually every story you ever see has </v>
<v Speaker 2>such a structure.</v>

572
00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:48.233
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's compelling to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you meet someone who's </v>

573
00:31:50.401 --> 00:31:53.940
<v Speaker 2>charismatic or who holds your attention </v>
<v Speaker 2>or who you're interested in,</v>

574
00:31:54.150 --> 00:31:58.320
<v Speaker 2>the probability that they're acting out </v>
<v Speaker 2>a mythological fragment is very,</v>

575
00:31:58.321 --> 00:32:00.900
<v Speaker 2>very high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why it is that your attention</v>

576
00:32:00.901 --> 00:32:02.070
<v Speaker 2>is captivated by them.</v>

577
00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:06.810
<v Speaker 2>What's the world like from this </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective?</v>

578
00:32:07.530 --> 00:32:07.981
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

579
00:32:07.981 --> 00:32:09.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're all sitting in this room.</v>

580
00:32:09.241 --> 00:32:11.520
<v Speaker 2>You think if I took out of here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how would you describe it?</v>

581
00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:13.290
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd say it was full of chairs.</v>

582
00:32:13.291 --> 00:32:15.720
<v Speaker 2>There was a table lights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

583
00:32:15.721 --> 00:32:17.700
<v Speaker 2>why would you pick that level of </v>
<v Speaker 2>resolution?</v>

584
00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:18.750
<v Speaker 2>They like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why wouldn't you say,</v>

585
00:32:18.751 --> 00:32:19.531
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

586
00:32:19.531 --> 00:32:23.670
<v Speaker 2>the average ceiling tile had about </v>
<v Speaker 2>15,000 dots on it.</v>

587
00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:26.730
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't seem like a relevant data </v>
<v Speaker 2>point,</v>

588
00:32:26.731 --> 00:32:28.200
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You say the same thing about the rug.</v>

589
00:32:28.201 --> 00:32:29.034
<v Speaker 2>There's no nothing stopping you from </v>
<v Speaker 2>counting the number of stains or the </v>

590
00:32:31.771 --> 00:32:32.604
<v Speaker 2>number of red spots or the way the light</v>
<v Speaker 2>plays off your partner's shirt or the </v>

591
00:32:36.121 --> 00:32:38.880
<v Speaker 2>shine on your shoes and if you are an </v>
<v Speaker 2>artist say,</v>

592
00:32:38.881 --> 00:32:40.790
<v Speaker 2>and to make a representation of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>room,</v>

593
00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:41.773
<v Speaker 2>you'd concentrate on aspects of it were </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely different from those that </v>

594
00:32:44.121 --> 00:32:44.990
<v Speaker 2>you're concentrating on.</v>

595
00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:48.530
<v Speaker 2>Now you talk about chairs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>TV cameras,</v>

596
00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:50.060
<v Speaker 2>cabinets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tables,</v>

597
00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:52.940
<v Speaker 2>why they're functional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're objects,</v>

598
00:32:52.941 --> 00:32:53.930
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their tools,</v>

599
00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:56.090
<v Speaker 2>they're tools there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things you can use.</v>

600
00:32:56.510 --> 00:32:59.180
<v Speaker 2>Normally when you're going from point a </v>
<v Speaker 2>to point B,</v>

601
00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:02.300
<v Speaker 2>you divide up the world into things you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can use.</v>

602
00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:05.330
<v Speaker 2>Those are things you see your perceptual</v>
<v Speaker 2>systems do,</v>

603
00:33:05.331 --> 00:33:09.620
<v Speaker 2>this things you can use and things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>might get in the way.</v>

604
00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:13.040
<v Speaker 2>And as you move from motivated world to </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivated world,</v>

605
00:33:13.041 --> 00:33:13.874
<v Speaker 2>the little stories that you inhabit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he chopped the world up in different </v>

606
00:33:15.741 --> 00:33:16.574
<v Speaker 2>paces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a piano for a concert pianist is </v>

607
00:33:19.071 --> 00:33:19.904
<v Speaker 2>different as a different phenomenon than</v>
<v Speaker 2>a piano for someone who has no musical </v>

608
00:33:23.151 --> 00:33:23.984
<v Speaker 2>education,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're always passing up the world </v>

609
00:33:25.911 --> 00:33:28.960
<v Speaker 2>in terms of what it's good for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how it can serve your purposes,</v>

610
00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:32.870
<v Speaker 2>and you even see it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the question is,</v>

611
00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:34.693
<v Speaker 2>the complicated question isn't so much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you parse up the world into </v>

612
00:33:37.581 --> 00:33:39.410
<v Speaker 2>things that are useful to you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like chairs.</v>

613
00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:41.383
<v Speaker 2>The complicated question is what do you </v>
<v Speaker 2>do when something that you don't expect </v>

614
00:33:46.071 --> 00:33:46.904
<v Speaker 2>happens?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So imagine you've had a 15 year long </v>

615
00:33:50.151 --> 00:33:50.984
<v Speaker 2>marriage</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you find lipstick on your husband's </v>

616
00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:57.263
<v Speaker 2>color.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not once but three times and then you </v>

617
00:33:59.931 --> 00:34:00.764
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

618
00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:04.170
<v Speaker 2>I thought I had a map,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

619
00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:05.693
<v Speaker 2>I thought we were both in the same game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought we were both going from point </v>

620
00:34:08.911 --> 00:34:09.744
<v Speaker 2>a to the same point B.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought we had established a shared </v>

621
00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:13.643
<v Speaker 2>structure of interpretation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I find that there's some aspect of </v>

622
00:34:17.221 --> 00:34:21.300
<v Speaker 2>his apparent behavior that's completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>outside my scope of interpretation.</v>

623
00:34:21.301 --> 00:34:23.250
<v Speaker 2>What do you do while you can choose to </v>
<v Speaker 2>ignore that,</v>

624
00:34:23.251 --> 00:34:24.420
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's easy to do that.</v>

625
00:34:24.421 --> 00:34:26.040
<v Speaker 2>Why would you not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would you ignore it?</v>

626
00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:30.210
<v Speaker 2>Because if you don't ignore it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to think he's not who I thought</v>

627
00:34:30.211 --> 00:34:31.044
<v Speaker 2>he was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's really not a good thing to </v>

628
00:34:32.491 --> 00:34:34.230
<v Speaker 2>think because people are really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

629
00:34:34.290 --> 00:34:35.123
<v Speaker 2>really complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if they're not who you think they </v>

630
00:34:37.411 --> 00:34:39.480
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have no idea who they might be.</v>

631
00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:41.250
<v Speaker 2>And you also might think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

632
00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:42.593
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'm not who I think I am because </v>
<v Speaker 2>after all I got sucked into this </v>

633
00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:46.553
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought I had pretty much understood </v>

634
00:34:48.211 --> 00:34:49.044
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it turns out that I certainly don't </v>

635
00:34:50.641 --> 00:34:51.474
<v Speaker 2>understand the opposite gender.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's some indication that I </v>

636
00:34:54.091 --> 00:34:57.750
<v Speaker 2>really don't even understand myself </v>
<v Speaker 2>because fundamentally I'm so clueless.</v>

637
00:34:57.990 --> 00:34:59.130
<v Speaker 2>And then you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

638
00:34:59.190 --> 00:35:00.023
<v Speaker 2>when did this start?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This cluelessness how long have I been </v>

639
00:35:02.521 --> 00:35:03.570
<v Speaker 2>blind?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

640
00:35:03.571 --> 00:35:06.120
<v Speaker 2>do you really want to ask that question </v>
<v Speaker 2>will not generally.</v>

641
00:35:06.121 --> 00:35:06.954
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's easier to keep the dragon in the </v>

642
00:35:07.981 --> 00:35:10.200
<v Speaker 2>closet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is where it tends to live.</v>

643
00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:14.100
<v Speaker 2>What happens when you encounter </v>
<v Speaker 2>something you don't?</v>

644
00:35:24.650 --> 00:35:27.380
<v Speaker 2>For a long time psychologist thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>that people learned fear,</v>

645
00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:30.180
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your typical person,</v>

646
00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:33.140
<v Speaker 2>your typical lab rat was a common </v>
<v Speaker 2>creature.</v>

647
00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:34.753
<v Speaker 2>Now it's a funny thing and because if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you take a lab rat out of his cage and </v>

648
00:35:38.491 --> 00:35:40.470
<v Speaker 2>you put them in a new cage where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to teach him,</v>

649
00:35:40.471 --> 00:35:41.304
<v Speaker 2>say to be afraid of something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be afraid of a light paired with a </v>

650
00:35:43.171 --> 00:35:44.004
<v Speaker 2>shock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a typical psychological </v>

651
00:35:44.881 --> 00:35:47.710
<v Speaker 2>experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The funny thing about the rat is you got</v>

652
00:35:47.711 --> 00:35:51.450
<v Speaker 2>to let him calm down before he's normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

653
00:35:51.451 --> 00:35:54.960
<v Speaker 2>except that you might think that the not</v>
<v Speaker 2>comrade is also the normal route,</v>

654
00:35:54.961 --> 00:35:55.794
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You take the rat out of this cage and </v>

655
00:35:56.551 --> 00:35:58.380
<v Speaker 2>you put them in the new cage and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>does he do?</v>

656
00:35:58.800 --> 00:35:59.980
<v Speaker 2>He goes like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

657
00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:01.050
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

658
00:36:01.051 --> 00:36:02.040
<v Speaker 2>he's a rat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

659
00:36:02.041 --> 00:36:02.874
<v Speaker 2>Someone might eat him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's a bit nervous about being in </v>

660
00:36:05.041 --> 00:36:05.880
<v Speaker 2>this new situation.</v>

661
00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:08.340
<v Speaker 2>Rats do not like being in new </v>
<v Speaker 2>situations.</v>

662
00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:09.323
<v Speaker 2>They don't like bright light.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you put them in a new situation </v>

663
00:36:11.311 --> 00:36:13.440
<v Speaker 2>that's brightly lit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go right over to the corner because</v>

664
00:36:13.441 --> 00:36:14.274
<v Speaker 2>they think maybe cats won't find them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rats are so afraid of cats that they </v>

665
00:36:17.461 --> 00:36:19.860
<v Speaker 2>never even have to meet a cat to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>afraid of them.</v>

666
00:36:19.861 --> 00:36:23.010
<v Speaker 2>So you can take a rat that's never seen </v>
<v Speaker 2>a cat in his life.</v>

667
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:25.920
<v Speaker 2>And if you let him smell some cat odor </v>
<v Speaker 2>or show him a cat,</v>

668
00:36:26.290 --> 00:36:27.270
<v Speaker 2>he'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

669
00:36:27.271 --> 00:36:29.910
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you show a route,</v>

670
00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:32.310
<v Speaker 2>a cat somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't expect it.</v>

671
00:36:32.970 --> 00:36:37.770
<v Speaker 2>He will run back to his burrow and </v>
<v Speaker 2>scream for 24 hours.</v>

672
00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:42.000
<v Speaker 2>Now you imagine how scared you'd have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be to screen for 24 hours,</v>

673
00:36:42.001 --> 00:36:44.190
<v Speaker 2>especially given rattle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He lives about a year.</v>

674
00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:46.740
<v Speaker 2>So that would be for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like screaming,</v>

675
00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:49.650
<v Speaker 2>that'd be like screaming for three </v>
<v Speaker 2>months.</v>

676
00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:50.543
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

677
00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:56.700
<v Speaker 2>So the rat runs back to his burrow and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he screams and every other rat who hears</v>

678
00:36:56.701 --> 00:36:57.990
<v Speaker 2>him scream,</v>
<v Speaker 2>freezes.</v>

679
00:36:58.050 --> 00:37:02.370
<v Speaker 2>And they all stay like that for 24 hours</v>
<v Speaker 2>until they sort of calm down.</v>

680
00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:04.013
<v Speaker 2>And then the first thing they do is they</v>
<v Speaker 2>go back to the place where they saw the </v>

681
00:37:05.701 --> 00:37:09.330
<v Speaker 2>cat and they start to map it out so they</v>
<v Speaker 2>do these things called corner runs,</v>

682
00:37:09.331 --> 00:37:12.120
<v Speaker 2>which is so the rat and wants to go back</v>
<v Speaker 2>to this territory.</v>

683
00:37:12.121 --> 00:37:12.954
<v Speaker 2>He knows the territory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be a place where he gets food </v>

684
00:37:14.730 --> 00:37:18.030
<v Speaker 2>is the cat's still there while you might</v>
<v Speaker 2>think stay in the borough,</v>

685
00:37:18.031 --> 00:37:18.864
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then maybe you don't get something </v>

686
00:37:19.621 --> 00:37:20.454
<v Speaker 2>to eat so the rat goes back to the place</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the cap was carefully and then he </v>

687
00:37:25.471 --> 00:37:26.304
<v Speaker 2>hunches down and he runs over part of it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if nothing kills him then he goes </v>

688
00:37:29.941 --> 00:37:30.774
<v Speaker 2>back and does the same thing with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little more of the territory until </v>

689
00:37:32.401 --> 00:37:34.800
<v Speaker 2>finally the rats of running all over the</v>
<v Speaker 2>territory again.</v>

690
00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:38.610
<v Speaker 2>Then they go back to eating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making love,</v>

691
00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:39.653
<v Speaker 2>paying attention to their families </v>
<v Speaker 2>because rats are quite social despite </v>

692
00:37:42.210 --> 00:37:43.043
<v Speaker 2>the fact that they're rat</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rat smart enough to go back to the </v>

693
00:37:47.221 --> 00:37:48.510
<v Speaker 2>scene of the crime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>

694
00:37:48.511 --> 00:37:50.040
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to let the dragon,</v>

695
00:37:50.041 --> 00:37:50.874
<v Speaker 2>that might be their grow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The rat knows that if something is </v>

696
00:37:53.731 --> 00:37:55.310
<v Speaker 2>terrifying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it should be investigated,</v>

697
00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:56.370
<v Speaker 2>not run away from.</v>

698
00:37:59.250 --> 00:38:00.083
<v Speaker 2>The question is what do you encounter </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you encounter something you don't </v>

699
00:38:02.581 --> 00:38:03.840
<v Speaker 2>expect and so you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

700
00:38:03.841 --> 00:38:05.640
<v Speaker 2>you've got your spouse mapped out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

701
00:38:05.641 --> 00:38:07.230
<v Speaker 2>But then they do something you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>expect,</v>

702
00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:09.030
<v Speaker 2>which hopefully happens fairly </v>
<v Speaker 2>regularly,</v>

703
00:38:09.031 --> 00:38:09.864
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because otherwise you get bored with </v>

704
00:38:10.471 --> 00:38:11.304
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do something you don't expect and </v>

705
00:38:12.511 --> 00:38:13.760
<v Speaker 2>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Aha,</v>

706
00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:15.960
<v Speaker 2>who is that person?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Precisely.</v>

707
00:38:16.110 --> 00:38:16.943
<v Speaker 2>And what that means is that what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what that means is that when you </v>

708
00:38:20.101 --> 00:38:23.760
<v Speaker 2>encounter something unexpected,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you actually can't see what's there.</v>

709
00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:26.820
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it's too complicated.</v>

710
00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:27.863
<v Speaker 2>You might have to spend a month talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>to your spouse to figure out just </v>

711
00:38:31.891 --> 00:38:34.830
<v Speaker 2>exactly why they have that particular </v>
<v Speaker 2>peculiar opinion.</v>

712
00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:38.350
<v Speaker 2>You have to explore and dig to find out </v>
<v Speaker 2>how they map the world.</v>

713
00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:39.393
<v Speaker 2>If you encounter something unexpected,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first thing you see is not the </v>

714
00:38:41.951 --> 00:38:42.784
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first thing you see is just a sense </v>

715
00:38:45.611 --> 00:38:46.444
<v Speaker 2>of discomfort and fear combined with </v>
<v Speaker 2>some late and curiosity that the world </v>

716
00:38:51.281 --> 00:38:53.080
<v Speaker 2>is not the way you thought it was.</v>

717
00:38:54.130 --> 00:38:54.963
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you find out what the world is </v>

718
00:38:56.561 --> 00:38:59.050
<v Speaker 2>actually like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to investigate it.</v>

719
00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:01.870
<v Speaker 2>You have to investigate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It means you have to take a risk.</v>

720
00:39:01.871 --> 00:39:02.704
<v Speaker 2>You have to move forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The same way that people do in </v>

721
00:39:03.731 --> 00:39:04.564
<v Speaker 2>psychotherapy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to find the thing that you're </v>

722
00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:09.850
<v Speaker 2>bordering on avoiding and going and map </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

723
00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:11.320
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a curious thing.</v>

724
00:39:11.321 --> 00:39:14.110
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>common anxiety disorders,</v>

725
00:39:14.111 --> 00:39:14.944
<v Speaker 2>agora phobia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Agora phobia is a generalized anxiety </v>

726
00:39:18.221 --> 00:39:19.054
<v Speaker 2>disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people who suffer severely from </v>

727
00:39:20.741 --> 00:39:24.460
<v Speaker 2>Agora Phobia often get to the point </v>
<v Speaker 2>where because of their panics,</v>

728
00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:25.863
<v Speaker 2>they're housebound.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't go outside their room or </v>

729
00:39:28.181 --> 00:39:29.050
<v Speaker 2>their house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

730
00:39:29.051 --> 00:39:31.270
<v Speaker 2>they'd run away from their room or their</v>
<v Speaker 2>house too if they could,</v>

731
00:39:31.271 --> 00:39:32.104
<v Speaker 2>but there's nowhere to run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're pretty much stuck being </v>

732
00:39:34.031 --> 00:39:36.040
<v Speaker 2>somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

733
00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:40.150
<v Speaker 2>an agoraphobic comes in for therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

734
00:39:40.151 --> 00:39:40.984
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you do with them?</v>

735
00:39:41.290 --> 00:39:42.041
<v Speaker 2>And you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

736
00:39:42.041 --> 00:39:44.020
<v Speaker 2>then I agoraphobic says I can't go on </v>
<v Speaker 2>elevators.</v>

737
00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:45.341
<v Speaker 2>And you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

738
00:39:45.341 --> 00:39:48.040
<v Speaker 2>well let's go try.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you say,</v>

739
00:39:48.041 --> 00:39:48.874
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well</v>

740
00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:52.660
<v Speaker 2>relax.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's teach the person to breathe.</v>

741
00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:54.400
<v Speaker 2>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't help that much,</v>

742
00:39:54.401 --> 00:39:57.310
<v Speaker 2>but it makes them feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can do this without teaching them to</v>

743
00:39:57.311 --> 00:39:58.750
<v Speaker 2>relax.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter a bit,</v>

744
00:39:58.870 --> 00:40:01.120
<v Speaker 2>but it does help them feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You say,</v>

745
00:40:01.121 --> 00:40:02.430
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well there's the elevator saying,</v>

746
00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:04.720
<v Speaker 2>how close can you get to the elevator?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They say,</v>

747
00:40:04.721 --> 00:40:05.021
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

748
00:40:05.021 --> 00:40:05.854
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't really get more than like 20 </v>

749
00:40:07.751 --> 00:40:08.590
<v Speaker 2>feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's maximum.</v>

750
00:40:08.591 --> 00:40:08.891
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

751
00:40:08.891 --> 00:40:09.724
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's just go up to 20 feet there and I </v>

752
00:40:12.341 --> 00:40:13.174
<v Speaker 2>may do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you let them stand there and </v>

753
00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:17.280
<v Speaker 2>stand there and stand there and stand </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and stand there.</v>

754
00:40:17.281 --> 00:40:20.620
<v Speaker 2>And sooner or later they get bored of </v>
<v Speaker 2>being 20 feet from the elevator.</v>

755
00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:22.270
<v Speaker 2>And then you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well look,</v>

756
00:40:22.271 --> 00:40:22.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let,</v>

757
00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:24.580
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't you go 10 feet?</v>

758
00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:26.890
<v Speaker 2>And I didn't know I couldn't go 10 feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's too close.</v>

759
00:40:27.130 --> 00:40:29.140
<v Speaker 2>How about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could you go three more feet?</v>

760
00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:30.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I could do that.</v>

761
00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:31.383
<v Speaker 2>So they go three more feet and then he </v>
<v Speaker 2>let them stand there and they find out </v>

762
00:40:34.121 --> 00:40:36.190
<v Speaker 2>nothing terrible is happening sooner or </v>
<v Speaker 2>later.</v>

763
00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:39.460
<v Speaker 2>And then they go another three feet and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then they go another three feet and then</v>

764
00:40:39.461 --> 00:40:40.294
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like confronting the elevator </v>

765
00:40:42.490 --> 00:40:45.490
<v Speaker 2>and then they're inside the elevator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they're going like this because they</v>

766
00:40:45.491 --> 00:40:47.140
<v Speaker 2>don't want to look at the elevator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

767
00:40:47.141 --> 00:40:47.771
<v Speaker 2>So you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

768
00:40:47.771 --> 00:40:49.690
<v Speaker 2>you've got to look at the elevator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can look at the numbers.</v>

769
00:40:49.691 --> 00:40:51.970
<v Speaker 2>You got to look at the buttons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

770
00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:53.740
<v Speaker 2>so they do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you think,</v>

771
00:40:53.741 --> 00:40:55.090
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could we go up a floor?</v>

772
00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:56.680
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we couldn't go up and floor.</v>

773
00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:57.880
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I'll tell you what,</v>

774
00:40:58.240 --> 00:40:59.290
<v Speaker 2>we'll just close the door.</v>

775
00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:01.360
<v Speaker 2>I'll put my hand and it'll open again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could you do that?</v>

776
00:41:01.450 --> 00:41:02.283
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could do that step by step sooner </v>

777
00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:06.490
<v Speaker 2>later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And usually sooner.</v>

778
00:41:06.491 --> 00:41:07.570
<v Speaker 2>Bang.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've gone up a floor.</v>

779
00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:08.980
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then what happens?</v>

780
00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:11.253
<v Speaker 2>They go home and have a fight with her </v>
<v Speaker 2>husband that's been brewing for like 15 </v>

781
00:41:13.811 --> 00:41:15.250
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

782
00:41:15.730 --> 00:41:16.563
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not because the elevators </v>

783
00:41:17.171 --> 00:41:20.380
<v Speaker 2>symbolically related to the fight has </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing to do with it.</v>

784
00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:26.140
<v Speaker 2>It's because what the person learns in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the combat with the unknown,</v>

785
00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:28.570
<v Speaker 2>which just happens to be taking the </v>
<v Speaker 2>guise of an elevator,</v>

786
00:41:28.810 --> 00:41:29.643
<v Speaker 2>is that they can confront things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>frightened them without being destroyed </v>

787
00:41:32.681 --> 00:41:35.540
<v Speaker 2>by the confrontation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what you see immediately,</v>

788
00:41:35.541 --> 00:41:38.540
<v Speaker 2>and this was contrary to in the original</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychoanalytic prediction,</v>

789
00:41:38.541 --> 00:41:39.860
<v Speaker 2>is that man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

790
00:41:39.861 --> 00:41:41.330
<v Speaker 2>you take that person out and you teach </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

791
00:41:41.331 --> 00:41:42.164
<v Speaker 2>they can go on the elevator and right </v>
<v Speaker 2>off the bat they're going to shopping </v>

792
00:41:44.331 --> 00:41:45.500
<v Speaker 2>malls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're in taxis,</v>

793
00:41:45.501 --> 00:41:48.740
<v Speaker 2>they're back in the subway and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>standing up for themselves at home.</v>

794
00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:50.720
<v Speaker 2>Generalization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

795
00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:53.660
<v Speaker 2>Because they didn't learn that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>elevator wasn't frightening.</v>

796
00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:55.063
<v Speaker 2>How doesn't let they learned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they learned that despite the fact that </v>

797
00:41:57.561 --> 00:42:00.440
<v Speaker 2>the elevator was this terrifying as </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything they've ever encountered,</v>

798
00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:01.453
<v Speaker 2>they were actually up to the challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now that's a really useful thing to </v>

799
00:42:04.551 --> 00:42:05.301
<v Speaker 2>teach someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

800
00:42:05.301 --> 00:42:08.720
<v Speaker 2>Because have you have an obsessive </v>
<v Speaker 2>compulsive patient?</v>

801
00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:10.460
<v Speaker 2>Now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had one who actually used to work with</v>

802
00:42:10.461 --> 00:42:11.294
<v Speaker 2>radiation or he was Tara.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He worked in some kind of bio lab in </v>

803
00:42:14.301 --> 00:42:15.134
<v Speaker 2>Montreal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People with obsessive compulsive </v>

804
00:42:16.851 --> 00:42:20.600
<v Speaker 2>disorder often fairly frightened if </v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll contaminate someone else.</v>

805
00:42:20.601 --> 00:42:21.434
<v Speaker 2>So like typical obsessive compulsive </v>
<v Speaker 2>obsession would be all go to a shopping </v>

806
00:42:25.281 --> 00:42:27.350
<v Speaker 2>market.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll touch some fruit from,</v>

807
00:42:27.351 --> 00:42:28.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some third world country.</v>

808
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:29.833
<v Speaker 2>I'll get some nasty bacterial disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll bring it home and I'll give it to </v>

809
00:42:32.121 --> 00:42:34.610
<v Speaker 2>my kids while you tell them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

810
00:42:34.611 --> 00:42:39.230
<v Speaker 2>you know the chances of that are like </v>
<v Speaker 2>one in 150,000 when they look at you and</v>

811
00:42:39.231 --> 00:42:40.064
<v Speaker 2>they think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if the chances are only </v>

812
00:42:42.381 --> 00:42:46.640
<v Speaker 2>150,000 what if my kids die?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you think,</v>

813
00:42:46.641 --> 00:42:47.091
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

814
00:42:47.091 --> 00:42:48.710
<v Speaker 2>that does pose a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't it?</v>

815
00:42:48.711 --> 00:42:49.544
<v Speaker 2>Because it isn't exactly clear from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>logical perspective where you should </v>

816
00:42:52.551 --> 00:42:53.930
<v Speaker 2>draw the risk line.</v>

817
00:42:57.450 --> 00:42:58.690
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the obsessive compulsive,</v>

818
00:42:58.691 --> 00:43:00.010
<v Speaker 2>you do exactly the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You say,</v>

819
00:43:00.011 --> 00:43:00.431
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

820
00:43:00.431 --> 00:43:01.600
<v Speaker 2>your fears real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No kidding.</v>

821
00:43:01.601 --> 00:43:02.434
<v Speaker 2>Because lurking at the bottom of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>fear is the same fear that everybody </v>

822
00:43:05.261 --> 00:43:06.190
<v Speaker 2>else has.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

823
00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:09.070
<v Speaker 2>Same fear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might die,</v>

824
00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:11.800
<v Speaker 2>I might get sick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might lose the people that I love.</v>

825
00:43:11.830 --> 00:43:14.620
<v Speaker 2>Not only might that happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to happen.</v>

826
00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:17.320
<v Speaker 2>Why aren't people afraid of that all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time?</v>

827
00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:22.390
<v Speaker 2>We don't really know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obsessive person becomes aware of it.</v>

828
00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:24.640
<v Speaker 2>What do you tell them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You say do it anyway,</v>

829
00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:26.193
<v Speaker 2>do it anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they learned quickly that if they </v>

830
00:43:28.301 --> 00:43:30.520
<v Speaker 2>don't run away from the thing they </v>
<v Speaker 2>afraid of,</v>

831
00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:32.800
<v Speaker 2>there's something in them that responds </v>
<v Speaker 2>to it.</v>

832
00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:38.100
<v Speaker 2>They learned that the fear is not larger</v>
<v Speaker 2>than they are now.</v>

833
00:43:38.171 --> 00:43:40.480
<v Speaker 2>I like getting the phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his case in particular,</v>

834
00:43:40.481 --> 00:43:42.190
<v Speaker 2>because you've always might wonder with </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

835
00:43:42.191 --> 00:43:43.060
<v Speaker 2>like what's the limit?</v>

836
00:43:43.090 --> 00:43:43.601
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

837
00:43:43.601 --> 00:43:44.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That sounds good in theory,</v>

838
00:43:44.801 --> 00:43:46.970
<v Speaker 2>but what if something really terrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened to you?</v>

839
00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:47.861
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's happened,</v>

840
00:43:47.861 --> 00:43:48.694
<v Speaker 2>dad?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The forest patient starts up there with </v>

841
00:43:49.991 --> 00:43:50.824
<v Speaker 2>terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

842
00:43:50.830 --> 00:43:52.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's up there with terrible,</v>

843
00:43:52.850 --> 00:43:57.850
<v Speaker 2>right stripped of social dignity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>violated physically that combines two of</v>

844
00:43:58.421 --> 00:44:01.420
<v Speaker 2>people's most specific fears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

845
00:44:01.421 --> 00:44:04.390
<v Speaker 2>then there's other kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>confrontation to it.</v>

846
00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:05.313
<v Speaker 2>I liked the story of Solzhenitsyn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's really a good one because </v>

847
00:44:07.211 --> 00:44:08.620
<v Speaker 2>there's different kinds of dragons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

848
00:44:08.621 --> 00:44:11.950
<v Speaker 2>There's natural dragons like death and </v>
<v Speaker 2>disease,</v>

849
00:44:12.070 --> 00:44:15.340
<v Speaker 2>and then there's social dragons like </v>
<v Speaker 2>bureaucracies and tyrannies.</v>

850
00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:20.290
<v Speaker 2>Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you may or may not know as a prisoner in</v>

851
00:44:20.291 --> 00:44:23.710
<v Speaker 2>the salt Soviet ghoulag concentration </v>
<v Speaker 2>camp system,</v>

852
00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:24.813
<v Speaker 2>that by his report at least killed 60 </v>
<v Speaker 2>million people between 1919 to 1959 </v>

853
00:44:28.721 --> 00:44:29.740
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>60 million.</v>

854
00:44:29.770 --> 00:44:31.800
<v Speaker 2>That's 10 times as many as Hitler </v>
<v Speaker 2>killed,</v>

855
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:36.460
<v Speaker 2>at least with regards to the genocide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>60 million people soldier knits,</v>

856
00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:37.830
<v Speaker 2>and he had a pretty nasty life.</v>

857
00:44:37.830 --> 00:44:38.461
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

858
00:44:38.461 --> 00:44:41.460
<v Speaker 2>he's on the Russian front,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was a nasty place to be.</v>

859
00:44:41.990 --> 00:44:44.940
<v Speaker 2>Then he was captured by the Germans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they didn't like Russians.</v>

860
00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:48.030
<v Speaker 2>So they put them in separate prisoners </v>
<v Speaker 2>of war camp,</v>

861
00:44:48.031 --> 00:44:48.864
<v Speaker 2>partly because Stella and who was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>consummate paranoid wouldn't sign the </v>

862
00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:54.180
<v Speaker 2>Geneva Convention on the treatment of </v>
<v Speaker 2>prisoners of war.</v>

863
00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:58.380
<v Speaker 2>So the German set up extra pow camps for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Russians,</v>

864
00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:02.490
<v Speaker 2>and they starve generally so badly that </v>
<v Speaker 2>if other POW is we're in the vicinity,</v>

865
00:45:02.491 --> 00:45:03.324
<v Speaker 2>they throw food packages over the wire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though they themselves weren't </v>

866
00:45:06.451 --> 00:45:09.300
<v Speaker 2>particularly well fed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then,</v>

867
00:45:09.301 --> 00:45:10.134
<v Speaker 2>so the war ends and the Russians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we ended solution gets up and goes back </v>

868
00:45:11.941 --> 00:45:12.661
<v Speaker 2>to Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

869
00:45:12.661 --> 00:45:13.710
<v Speaker 2>And what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's thinking,</v>

870
00:45:13.711 --> 00:45:14.311
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

871
00:45:14.311 --> 00:45:15.144
<v Speaker 2>this is over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We help defend the father land we're </v>

872
00:45:17.971 --> 00:45:19.650
<v Speaker 2>going to get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if not a hero's welcome,</v>

873
00:45:19.651 --> 00:45:21.630
<v Speaker 2>at least some welcome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But stellan figured,</v>

874
00:45:21.631 --> 00:45:22.464
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

875
00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:26.640
<v Speaker 2>These Russians had been to the west.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were contaminated by their exposure</v>

876
00:45:26.641 --> 00:45:29.730
<v Speaker 2>to the Western economic system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as a consequence of that,</v>

877
00:45:29.731 --> 00:45:31.830
<v Speaker 2>they posed a threat to the integrity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Soviet state.</v>

878
00:45:31.831 --> 00:45:33.810
<v Speaker 2>So he just threw them all in </v>
<v Speaker 2>concentration camps.</v>

879
00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:35.453
<v Speaker 2>So fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Solzhenitsyn sitting there in this </v>

880
00:45:37.501 --> 00:45:41.160
<v Speaker 2>concentration camp on a coal pile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a coal pile,</v>

881
00:45:41.161 --> 00:45:41.994
<v Speaker 2>which contain this kind of clay that his</v>
<v Speaker 2>compatriots would eat because they were </v>

882
00:45:44.761 --> 00:45:47.370
<v Speaker 2>so damn hungry that it was better to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have the clay in their stomach,</v>

883
00:45:47.371 --> 00:45:48.840
<v Speaker 2>that nothing at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he thought,</v>

884
00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:53.130
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the hell did I do to get here?</v>

885
00:45:53.970 --> 00:45:55.890
<v Speaker 2>Which is really a remarkable thing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

886
00:45:55.891 --> 00:45:56.724
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because like there was the second world </v>

887
00:45:57.721 --> 00:46:01.320
<v Speaker 2>war and that probably couldn't been </v>
<v Speaker 2>pinned directly on him.</v>

888
00:46:01.590 --> 00:46:03.480
<v Speaker 2>And then there's Stellan who was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

889
00:46:03.481 --> 00:46:05.490
<v Speaker 2>really one of the world's worst </v>
<v Speaker 2>monsters.</v>

890
00:46:05.850 --> 00:46:09.300
<v Speaker 2>And then there's the concentration camp </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the POW camp.</v>

891
00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:11.900
<v Speaker 2>And like a lot of things happened to </v>
<v Speaker 2>soldier Knutsen,</v>

892
00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:15.680
<v Speaker 2>but he said he had nothing but time to </v>
<v Speaker 2>think in this concentration camp.</v>

893
00:46:15.681 --> 00:46:18.030
<v Speaker 2>And he wasn't really that happy with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way things turned out.</v>

894
00:46:18.031 --> 00:46:21.360
<v Speaker 2>So he made a vow in the camp and the vow</v>
<v Speaker 2>was this.</v>

895
00:46:21.361 --> 00:46:24.270
<v Speaker 2>He said he is going to go back over his </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole life,</v>

896
00:46:24.330 --> 00:46:25.163
<v Speaker 2>whole life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right from day one and try to remember </v>

897
00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:31.140
<v Speaker 2>every time he ever did something he </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought was wrong.</v>

898
00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:32.551
<v Speaker 2>He thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

899
00:46:32.551 --> 00:46:33.384
<v Speaker 2>not someone else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that that gave his conscience a </v>

900
00:46:35.701 --> 00:46:37.740
<v Speaker 2>Pang.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How'd he said?</v>

901
00:46:37.741 --> 00:46:38.574
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>since I don't have anything better to </v>

902
00:46:39.271 --> 00:46:40.104
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to spend like the next 10 </v>

903
00:46:40.591 --> 00:46:44.880
<v Speaker 2>years seeing if I can undo all those </v>
<v Speaker 2>little knots in my soul that I tied.</v>

904
00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:46.343
<v Speaker 2>And the consequence of that was that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrote a book called the Gulag </v>

905
00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:48.841
<v Speaker 2>Archipelago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

906
00:46:48.841 --> 00:46:51.510
<v Speaker 2>Three volume book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>1900 pages long.</v>

907
00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:52.433
<v Speaker 2>He memorized it because there wasn't any</v>
<v Speaker 2>paper and pencil available for him in </v>

908
00:46:55.381 --> 00:46:56.214
<v Speaker 2>prison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it circulated in the </v>

909
00:46:58.381 --> 00:46:59.214
<v Speaker 2>underground and the Soviet Union for </v>
<v Speaker 2>years before it got published in the </v>

910
00:47:01.501 --> 00:47:02.334
<v Speaker 2>last published in 1975 definitely one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the literary events that brought down </v>

911
00:47:07.351 --> 00:47:09.600
<v Speaker 2>the Soviet Union.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think that's kind of interesting,</v>

912
00:47:09.601 --> 00:47:11.190
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>To think this one guy,</v>

913
00:47:11.191 --> 00:47:13.410
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got numbers tattooed on his arm.</v>

914
00:47:13.411 --> 00:47:15.750
<v Speaker 2>He's a skinny as a rail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's three quarters dead.</v>

915
00:47:15.751 --> 00:47:18.060
<v Speaker 2>He's been beat to death in 15 different </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways.</v>

916
00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:19.583
<v Speaker 2>He decides under completely unreasonable</v>
<v Speaker 2>circumstances that he's going to take </v>

917
00:47:23.011 --> 00:47:26.070
<v Speaker 2>personal responsibility for the position</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he happens to find himself in.</v>

918
00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:27.053
<v Speaker 2>The consequence of that 25 years later </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that Solzhenitsyn's still around but </v>

919
00:47:30.311 --> 00:47:31.144
<v Speaker 2>the Soviet Union isn't and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that can't be the way the world </v>

920
00:47:34.151 --> 00:47:36.370
<v Speaker 2>works now Canon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you think this too,</v>

921
00:47:36.371 --> 00:47:38.470
<v Speaker 2>like do we really know how the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>works?</v>

922
00:47:38.471 --> 00:47:39.304
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've had a pretty nasty century in the </v>

923
00:47:41.530 --> 00:47:41.921
<v Speaker 2>last hundred years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

924
00:47:41.921 --> 00:47:44.020
<v Speaker 2>We had the Nazis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had mt say tongue.</v>

925
00:47:44.290 --> 00:47:45.123
<v Speaker 2>We had the recent tragedies in Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't seem to learn anything about </v>

926
00:47:47.891 --> 00:47:50.290
<v Speaker 2>genocide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone like Solzhenitsyn says,</v>

927
00:47:50.291 --> 00:47:51.124
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

928
00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:54.940
<v Speaker 1>might be your fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

929
00:47:55.450 --> 00:47:56.350
<v Speaker 1>What are you ignoring?</v>

930
00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:00.170
<v Speaker 2>Good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you make peace with your own family?</v>

931
00:48:00.590 --> 00:48:01.640
<v Speaker 2>It's not so easy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

932
00:48:02.270 --> 00:48:03.103
<v Speaker 2>It's probably no easier than making </v>
<v Speaker 2>peace between the Israelis and the </v>

933
00:48:04.821 --> 00:48:05.654
<v Speaker 2>Palestinians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are we encounter when we </v>

934
00:48:11.281 --> 00:48:12.930
<v Speaker 2>encountered something we don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand?</v>

935
00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:18.540
<v Speaker 2>We don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not the simple world of objects.</v>

936
00:48:18.690 --> 00:48:21.420
<v Speaker 2>The simple world of objects is something</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've learned to see.</v>

937
00:48:21.630 --> 00:48:25.950
<v Speaker 2>The real world is way more complicated </v>
<v Speaker 2>than what we just see.</v>

938
00:48:26.250 --> 00:48:27.390
<v Speaker 2>Let me give you an example.</v>

939
00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:34.640
<v Speaker 2>When I was in Montreal in 1985 my </v>
<v Speaker 2>computer crashed.</v>

940
00:48:36.350 --> 00:48:37.790
<v Speaker 2>So what do you do when your computer </v>
<v Speaker 2>crashes?</v>

941
00:48:37.791 --> 00:48:38.624
<v Speaker 2>While we're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not computer encounter something </v>

942
00:48:39.951 --> 00:48:41.240
<v Speaker 2>unexpected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It crashes.</v>

943
00:48:41.241 --> 00:48:43.130
<v Speaker 2>It can't do a damn thing about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to fix it.</v>

944
00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:45.890
<v Speaker 2>So I checked the monitoring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was okay.</v>

945
00:48:45.900 --> 00:48:48.230
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't go on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seemed all right.</v>

946
00:48:49.170 --> 00:48:52.040
<v Speaker 2>Then I noticed my labs weren't working,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I went to the fuse box.</v>

947
00:48:52.041 --> 00:48:56.060
<v Speaker 2>So all the fuses seemed okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then I went outside to go down to the</v>

948
00:48:56.061 --> 00:48:59.000
<v Speaker 2>corner store to get a cigarette and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>saw that outside.</v>

949
00:48:59.001 --> 00:49:01.010
<v Speaker 2>All the lights were off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the traffic lights were off,</v>

950
00:49:01.580 --> 00:49:03.290
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole city was in darkness.</v>

951
00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:07.040
<v Speaker 2>Then I found out the next day that there</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a solar wind,</v>

952
00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:09.253
<v Speaker 2>big solar flare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put out a big cloud of electrons zipped </v>

953
00:49:12.471 --> 00:49:13.304
<v Speaker 2>along to Earth at the speed of light,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put an electrical pulse through the </v>

954
00:49:16.341 --> 00:49:17.240
<v Speaker 2>Hydro Electric Grid.</v>

955
00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:20.810
<v Speaker 2>And Quebec crashed my computer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

956
00:49:21.350 --> 00:49:22.183
<v Speaker 2>I hadn't thought until that point that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the integrity of my computer was </v>

957
00:49:26.121 --> 00:49:26.954
<v Speaker 2>dependent on the stability of the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything is way more complicated than </v>

958
00:49:31.551 --> 00:49:33.980
<v Speaker 2>it looks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when you just look at something,</v>

959
00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:36.800
<v Speaker 2>you see a very simple representation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's actually there.</v>

960
00:49:37.550 --> 00:49:40.520
<v Speaker 2>What do you encounter when you encounter</v>
<v Speaker 2>something unexpected?</v>

961
00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:42.950
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you first encounter it,</v>

962
00:49:43.550 --> 00:49:47.780
<v Speaker 2>you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All you know is that frightens you,</v>

963
00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:51.830
<v Speaker 2>but it makes you curious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think dragons,</v>

964
00:49:51.831 --> 00:49:54.410
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every primates afraid of lizards,</v>

965
00:49:54.890 --> 00:49:57.380
<v Speaker 2>including us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chimpanzees don't like snakes.</v>

966
00:49:57.381 --> 00:49:58.880
<v Speaker 2>If you take a champ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's never seen a snake.</v>

967
00:49:58.881 --> 00:50:02.240
<v Speaker 2>You throw it us to show it a snake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will hit the roof of its cage.</v>

968
00:50:02.750 --> 00:50:07.460
<v Speaker 2>Then it'll look at the snake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would a drag and hoard gold?</v>

969
00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:12.150
<v Speaker 2>Because a dragon represents everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're afraid of.</v>

970
00:50:12.990 --> 00:50:15.360
<v Speaker 2>What's embedded in everything that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're afraid of.</v>

971
00:50:16.740 --> 00:50:21.060
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely everything that you need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>find run from what you're afraid of,</v>

972
00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:22.793
<v Speaker 2>run from exactly what you need to find.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the oldest dramatic </v>

973
00:50:36.921 --> 00:50:39.470
<v Speaker 2>representations we know of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not this specific painting.</v>

974
00:50:39.471 --> 00:50:43.730
<v Speaker 2>This is Saint George and the dragon </v>
<v Speaker 2>dragon lives in the ground</v>

975
00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:47.253
<v Speaker 2>chase,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thereby heroes of a previous generation </v>

976
00:50:50.710 --> 00:50:54.280
<v Speaker 2>now and then re-emerging kills people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

977
00:50:54.310 --> 00:50:55.810
<v Speaker 2>These are skulls around it's</v>

978
00:50:56.670 --> 00:50:57.503
<v Speaker 1>layer.</v>

979
00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:01.070
<v Speaker 2>It threatens the integrity of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>

980
00:51:01.490 --> 00:51:06.260
<v Speaker 2>Like everything unexpected does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hero comes out,</v>

981
00:51:08.210 --> 00:51:12.760
<v Speaker 2>slays the dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>freeze the treasure.</v>

982
00:51:13.210 --> 00:51:14.890
<v Speaker 2>This case it's a virgin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a woman</v>

983
00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:25.613
<v Speaker 2>dragon's hoard gold because the thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>you most need is always to be found </v>

984
00:51:30.650 --> 00:51:31.483
<v Speaker 2>where you least want to look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to close this with another </v>

985
00:51:35.851 --> 00:51:36.684
<v Speaker 2>dream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is dream my five year old nephew </v>

986
00:51:41.161 --> 00:51:41.994
<v Speaker 2>had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now he got to get the context of this </v>

987
00:51:44.461 --> 00:51:46.410
<v Speaker 2>stream right here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>After this dream,</v>

988
00:51:46.530 --> 00:51:51.530
<v Speaker 2>parents were divorced</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there were dragons in the house.</v>

989
00:51:54.750 --> 00:51:55.583
<v Speaker 2>He was about four at this time is </v>
<v Speaker 2>running around the house with this </v>

990
00:51:57.361 --> 00:52:00.420
<v Speaker 2>little plastic night helmet on and its </v>
<v Speaker 2>sword is zipping around,</v>

991
00:52:00.421 --> 00:52:03.330
<v Speaker 2>killing things with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing this all at the time and even when</v>

992
00:52:03.331 --> 00:52:04.650
<v Speaker 2>he went to sleep at night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'd put this,</v>

993
00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:08.550
<v Speaker 2>the a sword by his pillow and the night </v>
<v Speaker 2>helmet on his pillow.</v>

994
00:52:08.710 --> 00:52:09.543
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every night or every second night or </v>

995
00:52:10.981 --> 00:52:13.650
<v Speaker 2>every third night for six months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'd been waking up screaming.</v>

996
00:52:13.770 --> 00:52:14.603
<v Speaker 2>Now why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>While he was about to go to </v>

997
00:52:15.691 --> 00:52:16.381
<v Speaker 2>kindergarten,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

998
00:52:16.381 --> 00:52:18.340
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a real threshold for kid,</v>

999
00:52:18.370 --> 00:52:21.210
<v Speaker 2>way from maternal dependence </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally into the real world.</v>

1000
00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:23.610
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a new thing.</v>

1001
00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:29.360
<v Speaker 2>But also there was upset in his house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was there one night when he woke up</v>

1002
00:52:29.671 --> 00:52:30.960
<v Speaker 2>screaming next morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1003
00:52:30.961 --> 00:52:32.280
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you dream anything?</v>

1004
00:52:32.281 --> 00:52:34.500
<v Speaker 2>And so he launched into this story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

1005
00:52:36.670 --> 00:52:37.503
<v Speaker 2>dwarf.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was in this field and these little </v>

1006
00:52:40.121 --> 00:52:44.050
<v Speaker 2>creatures like dwarves were coming up to</v>
<v Speaker 2>him and they didn't have any arms.</v>

1007
00:52:44.051 --> 00:52:47.230
<v Speaker 2>They just had legs and they were bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big beaks.</v>

1008
00:52:47.290 --> 00:52:48.123
<v Speaker 2>And they were covered with hair and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Greece and on top of their head was </v>

1009
00:52:50.501 --> 00:52:51.334
<v Speaker 2>across,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shaved into this hair and there's lots </v>

1010
00:52:54.131 --> 00:52:54.964
<v Speaker 2>and lots of these doors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were jumping on him with their </v>

1011
00:52:56.801 --> 00:52:57.750
<v Speaker 2>beaks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>biting him.</v>

1012
00:52:58.020 --> 00:53:00.250
<v Speaker 2>And we all looked at him thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1013
00:53:00.251 --> 00:53:01.660
<v Speaker 2>it's no wonder you're waking up </v>
<v Speaker 2>screaming,</v>

1014
00:53:01.690 --> 00:53:02.231
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1015
00:53:02.231 --> 00:53:03.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't sound so good.</v>

1016
00:53:03.641 --> 00:53:04.301
<v Speaker 2>And then he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1017
00:53:04.301 --> 00:53:07.210
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's more right back in the distance.</v>

1018
00:53:07.211 --> 00:53:08.044
<v Speaker 2>There's a dragon and the dragon is </v>
<v Speaker 2>puffing out fire and smoke and every </v>

1019
00:53:12.611 --> 00:53:15.670
<v Speaker 2>time he pops out foreign smoke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it turns into these dwarfs.</v>

1020
00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:17.350
<v Speaker 2>Big problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1021
00:53:17.351 --> 00:53:19.720
<v Speaker 2>Just like the problem with the Hydra in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Greek mythology,</v>

1022
00:53:19.930 --> 00:53:23.320
<v Speaker 2>cut off one head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven more appear.</v>

1023
00:53:23.410 --> 00:53:24.243
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So are you going to do about these kill </v>

1024
00:53:26.011 --> 00:53:28.410
<v Speaker 2>one big deal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 more common.</v>

1025
00:53:29.610 --> 00:53:30.443
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what can you do about that now in </v>

1026
00:53:33.691 --> 00:53:34.524
<v Speaker 2>illegal trial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would have been an inadmissible </v>

1027
00:53:35.881 --> 00:53:36.714
<v Speaker 2>question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1028
00:53:36.990 --> 00:53:37.823
<v Speaker 2>That's called leading the witness </v>
<v Speaker 2>because what I told him was despite the </v>

1029
00:53:41.281 --> 00:53:42.114
<v Speaker 2>horror of this situation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you maybe could do something about it </v>

1030
00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:46.950
<v Speaker 2>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hi,</v>

1031
00:53:46.980 --> 00:53:49.080
<v Speaker 2>I'd take my sword.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get my dad.</v>

1032
00:53:49.230 --> 00:53:50.190
<v Speaker 2>That's a good idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1033
00:53:50.191 --> 00:53:52.800
<v Speaker 2>Dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the real dad and then there's the</v>

1034
00:53:52.801 --> 00:53:54.060
<v Speaker 2>tradition dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1035
00:53:54.061 --> 00:53:54.894
<v Speaker 2>You might as well have your father by </v>
<v Speaker 2>your side if you're going to go into </v>

1036
00:53:56.221 --> 00:53:57.690
<v Speaker 2>battle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd take my sword,</v>

1037
00:53:57.691 --> 00:54:00.300
<v Speaker 2>I get my dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go to where the dragon was.</v>

1038
00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:02.033
<v Speaker 2>I jumped up on his head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put both of his eyes out with this </v>

1039
00:54:03.661 --> 00:54:06.880
<v Speaker 2>sword.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd go down his throat to the place with</v>

1040
00:54:06.881 --> 00:54:07.714
<v Speaker 2>the fire comes out.</v>

1041
00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:11.580
<v Speaker 2>I can cut a piece of that box out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd use it as a shield and I thought,</v>

1042
00:54:11.730 --> 00:54:13.770
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's unbelievable.</v>

1043
00:54:13.830 --> 00:54:15.810
<v Speaker 2>Unbelievable that he could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's perfect,</v>

1044
00:54:15.811 --> 00:54:17.490
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no sense going after the dwarves</v>

1045
00:54:17.510 --> 00:54:21.450
<v Speaker 2>because thousands of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might as well go after the dragon.</v>

1046
00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:25.350
<v Speaker 2>What happens if you go after the Dragon?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get a piece of it,</v>

1047
00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:28.020
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A piece of its center nature,</v>

1048
00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:32.730
<v Speaker 2>a piece that can defend you against </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything including other dragons.</v>

1049
00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:33.773
<v Speaker 2>So what if this was the case you think </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolutionarily speaking or religiously </v>

1050
00:54:39.121 --> 00:54:41.760
<v Speaker 2>speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if we were adapted to the world?</v>

1051
00:54:42.410 --> 00:54:46.080
<v Speaker 2>And what if it's not the simple place of</v>
<v Speaker 2>dead objects that we think it is?</v>

1052
00:54:46.081 --> 00:54:49.890
<v Speaker 2>What if it's something a lot more alive?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lot more like a story?</v>

1053
00:54:51.290 --> 00:54:52.950
<v Speaker 2>What if the story is something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>

1054
00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:59.300
<v Speaker 2>You have absolutely everything you need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have to use all of it.</v>

1055
00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:01.673
<v Speaker 2>If you run away from any of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in particular the parts of it that </v>

1056
00:55:04.411 --> 00:55:05.244
<v Speaker 2>frighten you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you know there's endless reasons </v>

1057
00:55:06.811 --> 00:55:09.330
<v Speaker 2>to run away from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you run away from any of it,</v>

1058
00:55:09.690 --> 00:55:14.070
<v Speaker 2>you don't get that piece of the Dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you miss even one piece,</v>

1059
00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:17.490
<v Speaker 2>there's a chink in your armor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a place where you're vulnerable.</v>

1060
00:55:17.610 --> 00:55:20.520
<v Speaker 2>If you make even one mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you lessen yourself.</v>

1061
00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:23.610
<v Speaker 2>If you less than yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to run away more.</v>

1062
00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:25.860
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when someone wants to lean on you,</v>

1063
00:55:26.790 --> 00:55:29.340
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to be able to lean on </v>
<v Speaker 2>you because you'll just fall over.</v>

1064
00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:30.953
<v Speaker 2>What if it was the case that we were </v>
<v Speaker 2>adapted to the world really adapted to </v>

1065
00:55:34.111 --> 00:55:37.980
<v Speaker 2>it so that if we made full use of all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the talents we had,</v>

1066
00:55:38.430 --> 00:55:39.263
<v Speaker 2>we'd be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if it was the case that if we set </v>

1067
00:55:42.541 --> 00:55:46.590
<v Speaker 2>out consciously to never run away from </v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

1068
00:55:46.591 --> 00:55:50.040
<v Speaker 2>we know we shouldn't run away from that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything would be all right.</v>

1069
00:55:51.230 --> 00:55:52.063
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1070
00:55:53.370 --> 00:55:55.110
<v Speaker 2>you can think whatever you want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

1071
00:55:55.111 --> 00:55:55.944
<v Speaker 2>but this is what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's bloody amazing that that </v>

1072
00:55:58.921 --> 00:55:59.754
<v Speaker 2>Little Kid's book that I read you at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>beginning of this lecture had all that </v>

1073
00:56:03.301 --> 00:56:04.134
<v Speaker 2>information in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so you might ask yourself when you </v>

1074
00:56:06.391 --> 00:56:10.050
<v Speaker 2>leave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that information isn't true,</v>

1075
00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:15.690
<v Speaker 2>how the hell did it get there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

1076
00:56:19.370 --> 00:56:23.960
