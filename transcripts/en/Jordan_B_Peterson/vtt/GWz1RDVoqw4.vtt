1
00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.050
<v Speaker 1>Well Dave and I are here today to talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about Patrion.</v>

2
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.123
<v Speaker 1>And so all start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've been engaged in lengthy series of </v>

3
00:00:07.771 --> 00:00:08.604
<v Speaker 1>email exchanges with all of the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>in our network and no one is happy at </v>

4
00:00:13.591 --> 00:00:14.424
<v Speaker 1>all with what's been happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we've been determining what our </v>

5
00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:21.060
<v Speaker 1>options are and we looked at subscribes </v>
<v Speaker 1>to our,</v>

6
00:00:21.061 --> 00:00:24.480
<v Speaker 1>but it looks like paypal decided to cut </v>
<v Speaker 1>funding out from them.</v>

7
00:00:24.481 --> 00:00:25.314
<v Speaker 1>And so it doesn't look like moving to an</v>
<v Speaker 1>alternative provider and an alternative </v>

8
00:00:28.981 --> 00:00:32.040
<v Speaker 1>commercial pro provider that's out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>our bailiwick,</v>

9
00:00:32.041 --> 00:00:33.660
<v Speaker 1>out of our control is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>viable.</v>

10
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.093
<v Speaker 1>So Dave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't you describe what we talked </v>

11
00:00:36.901 --> 00:00:37.734
<v Speaker 1>about today?</v>

12
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:38.783
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well first I think we should just make </v>

13
00:00:40.231 --> 00:00:41.064
<v Speaker 2>it very clear for everybody how </v>
<v Speaker 2>significant what happened to Carl </v>

14
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.673
<v Speaker 2>Benjamin Sargon of a cod is it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>matter what you think of him or whether </v>

15
00:00:49.501 --> 00:00:50.334
<v Speaker 2>you agree with him or any of that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The banning of him for doing something </v>

16
00:00:54.391 --> 00:00:58.440
<v Speaker 2>that was not on the Patriot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on platform that wasn't even done on his</v>

17
00:00:58.441 --> 00:01:03.441
<v Speaker 2>channel because of a word he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where he was using the word against the,</v>

18
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:04.703
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the alt right or the Neo Nazis or </v>

19
00:01:06.391 --> 00:01:11.190
<v Speaker 2>whatever you want to call them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a massive move of that line of what's</v>

20
00:01:11.191 --> 00:01:12.024
<v Speaker 2>acceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now there's all sorts of debates we can </v>

21
00:01:14.161 --> 00:01:16.470
<v Speaker 2>have and we've had them of what lines </v>
<v Speaker 2>should be,</v>

22
00:01:16.471 --> 00:01:17.304
<v Speaker 2>if there should be lines at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that this guy got booted </v>

23
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.980
<v Speaker 2>with no chance of recourse with no </v>
<v Speaker 2>warning,</v>

24
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.963
<v Speaker 2>just just like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just an extension of everything </v>

25
00:01:26.851 --> 00:01:28.010
<v Speaker 2>else that we've all been talking</v>

26
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.933
<v Speaker 1>also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also given that it's also the case </v>

27
00:01:31.371 --> 00:01:34.490
<v Speaker 1>that he didn't break patrons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rules of engagement,</v>

28
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:35.713
<v Speaker 1>the ones that they stated and that Kanye</v>
<v Speaker 1>had talked to you about the fact that </v>

29
00:01:39.231 --> 00:01:43.130
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't going to happen and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Patrion hasn't responded well to this.</v>

30
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.513
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

31
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.520
<v Speaker 2>Jack Conti came into my studio in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>home and said he,</v>

32
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.690
<v Speaker 2>he said a phrase that I had never heard </v>
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

33
00:01:51.691 --> 00:01:55.020
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you had heard it before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Manifest observable behaviors.</v>

34
00:01:55.021 --> 00:01:56.640
<v Speaker 2>So you had never even heard that phrase </v>
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>

35
00:01:56.641 --> 00:01:57.241
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

36
00:01:57.241 --> 00:01:59.310
<v Speaker 2>I thought maybe this was just something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that went past me.</v>

37
00:01:59.311 --> 00:02:00.144
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now of course manifest observable </v>

38
00:02:01.321 --> 00:02:03.390
<v Speaker 2>behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mob mob you can make,</v>

39
00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a real,</v>

40
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.010
<v Speaker 2>there's a real beauty there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

41
00:02:08.011 --> 00:02:08.844
<v Speaker 2>but so the point was that it had to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>about behavior and then in their terms </v>

42
00:02:11.941 --> 00:02:12.774
<v Speaker 2>of service,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it also had to be about what was </v>

43
00:02:13.831 --> 00:02:14.664
<v Speaker 2>happening on platforms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So every firewall here of what would </v>

44
00:02:18.081 --> 00:02:22.920
<v Speaker 2>have been acceptable patrion failed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they've put us in a position where,</v>

45
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.023
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told you I called you last Saturday </v>

46
00:02:25.231 --> 00:02:28.080
<v Speaker 2>and when this was really catching fire </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I said,</v>

47
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.943
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Patrion is about 65 to 70% of my rep </v>

48
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.360
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a company now with employees,</v>

49
00:02:33.361 --> 00:02:34.141
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>full timers,</v>

50
00:02:34.141 --> 00:02:34.974
<v Speaker 2>part timers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was actually considering deleting it </v>

51
00:02:37.321 --> 00:02:38.154
<v Speaker 2>right then and there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which no one in their right mind would </v>

52
00:02:40.141 --> 00:02:41.670
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No business person would do.</v>

53
00:02:41.671 --> 00:02:43.650
<v Speaker 2>And I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've taken big risks in the past.</v>

54
00:02:43.651 --> 00:02:46.380
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before I was on Patrion we were at,</v>

55
00:02:46.381 --> 00:02:48.960
<v Speaker 2>or tv I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>me and my producer and my director,</v>

56
00:02:48.961 --> 00:02:50.940
<v Speaker 2>we all quit our jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lost our health insurance,</v>

57
00:02:50.941 --> 00:02:52.920
<v Speaker 2>all that to join patriots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not,</v>

58
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.530
<v Speaker 2>I like taking risks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then I realized,</v>

59
00:02:55.531 --> 00:02:56.364
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to figure out a plan and that's </v>

60
00:02:57.511 --> 00:02:58.860
<v Speaker 2>exactly why we're doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

61
00:02:58.861 --> 00:02:59.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

62
00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.620
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

63
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.720
<v Speaker 1>and we would have moved faster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we,</v>

64
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.003
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I did set up a subscribes to our </v>

65
00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:04.834
<v Speaker 1>account,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I never quite finished setting </v>

66
00:03:06.251 --> 00:03:07.084
<v Speaker 1>it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because subscribes star seem to </v>

67
00:03:08.711 --> 00:03:12.010
<v Speaker 1>fall apart almost immediately under </v>
<v Speaker 1>attack.</v>

68
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:13.263
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also it wasn't obvious that I also </v>

69
00:03:15.281 --> 00:03:16.114
<v Speaker 1>read the terms of agreement and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't obvious that we weren't going to </v>

70
00:03:17.861 --> 00:03:20.200
<v Speaker 1>be just in exactly the same situation </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

71
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:21.453
<v Speaker 1>And there's only so many mistakes you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can make before the mistakes start to </v>

72
00:03:23.981 --> 00:03:24.814
<v Speaker 1>become fatal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we want it to come up with a serious </v>

73
00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.930
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

74
00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:28.630
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

75
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.040
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and stable solution.</v>

76
00:03:30.041 --> 00:03:33.970
<v Speaker 1>And I have been working on for months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally for months,</v>

77
00:03:33.971 --> 00:03:34.804
<v Speaker 1>it's been six months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd been working on a system to allow </v>

78
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:39.543
<v Speaker 1>authors and other people who engage </v>
<v Speaker 1>publicly on intellectually issues to </v>

79
00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.680
<v Speaker 1>interact more effectively with their </v>
<v Speaker 1>readers and viewers and listeners.</v>

80
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.273
<v Speaker 1>And it occurred to me this week that </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a bit of modification that that </v>

81
00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:58.600
<v Speaker 1>could serve exactly the function that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're hoping it would serve.</v>

82
00:03:58.601 --> 00:03:59.434
<v Speaker 1>So what we're going to try to do as fast</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we possibly can is to set the system </v>

83
00:04:03.641 --> 00:04:06.610
<v Speaker 1>up on a subscriber model that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>analogous to Patrion.</v>

84
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.560
<v Speaker 1>It'll have a bunch of additional </v>
<v Speaker 1>features,</v>

85
00:04:08.561 --> 00:04:10.090
<v Speaker 1>which I don't want to talk about right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

86
00:04:10.091 --> 00:04:12.400
<v Speaker 1>and I don't want to over promise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the system is,</v>

87
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:13.623
<v Speaker 1>is because the system is new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're gonna try to get that rolled </v>

88
00:04:18.461 --> 00:04:20.380
<v Speaker 1>out as fast as we possibly can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

89
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.473
<v Speaker 1>and we have a number of people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in hypothetically interested </v>

90
00:04:24.191 --> 00:04:27.670
<v Speaker 1>in moving their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their subscription service over to it.</v>

91
00:04:27.671 --> 00:04:32.590
<v Speaker 1>Dave and I are very seriously planning </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do this as soon as we can do it in an</v>

92
00:04:32.591 --> 00:04:34.700
<v Speaker 1>intelligent way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what,</v>

93
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:36.251
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

94
00:04:36.251 --> 00:04:38.920
<v Speaker 2>one of the interesting things here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we haven't talked about this,</v>

95
00:04:38.921 --> 00:04:40.930
<v Speaker 2>but I'm guessing you were experiences </v>
<v Speaker 2>just like mine,</v>

96
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:42.063
<v Speaker 2>the amount of emails that I have </v>
<v Speaker 2>received and kind of course tweets and </v>

97
00:04:44.321 --> 00:04:46.870
<v Speaker 2>everything else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but most of the emails from developers,</v>

98
00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.870
<v Speaker 2>from investors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from regular people,</v>

99
00:04:49.871 --> 00:04:52.030
<v Speaker 2>from engineers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean just anyone going,</v>

100
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.073
<v Speaker 2>this is the one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you know the issue with all of </v>

101
00:04:55.091 --> 00:04:59.140
<v Speaker 2>these free speech things is it's like </v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to swing too early before</v>

102
00:04:59.141 --> 00:05:02.020
<v Speaker 2>you realize that the problem's gotten to</v>
<v Speaker 2>critical mass as,</v>

103
00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.300
<v Speaker 2>but then most likely you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>swing too late.</v>

104
00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.330
<v Speaker 2>The lines will have so far that we may </v>
<v Speaker 2>be on the outside of them.</v>

105
00:05:07.331 --> 00:05:10.990
<v Speaker 2>And that's why this one I think was so </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting because Carl,</v>

106
00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:12.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>

107
00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.893
<v Speaker 2>five or six years ago when I started </v>
<v Speaker 2>waking up to what was going on with the </v>

108
00:05:16.211 --> 00:05:18.400
<v Speaker 2>left obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then all of the free speech stuff,</v>

109
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.510
<v Speaker 2>everyone said you've got to talk to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sargon of Akkad easy guide.</v>

110
00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.970
<v Speaker 2>So this is the guy that's been ahead of </v>
<v Speaker 2>all of it.</v>

111
00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.300
<v Speaker 1>So are going to was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was big.</v>

112
00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.150
<v Speaker 1>He was very helpful to me when I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>first under attack,</v>

113
00:05:30.151 --> 00:05:33.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's a brave God and,</v>

114
00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:34.613
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a real mistake what patron has </v>

115
00:05:36.091 --> 00:05:38.220
<v Speaker 1>done to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as I said,</v>

116
00:05:38.221 --> 00:05:41.160
<v Speaker 1>everybody in our network is extremely </v>
<v Speaker 1>upset about it.</v>

117
00:05:41.161 --> 00:05:43.080
<v Speaker 1>Like we've been sending emails back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>forth,</v>

118
00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.310
<v Speaker 1>well probably with 30 or 40 people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so as Dave said earlier,</v>

119
00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:48.323
<v Speaker 1>we wanted to make this video today to </v>
<v Speaker 1>let everybody that we're communicating </v>

120
00:05:51.151 --> 00:05:56.151
<v Speaker 1>with know that we have not been sleeping</v>
<v Speaker 1>on this front man.</v>

121
00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.550
<v Speaker 1>People are trying to figure out what to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

122
00:05:58.551 --> 00:06:01.790
<v Speaker 1>So this stops happening and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

123
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:02.863
<v Speaker 1>and we have a good plan and we're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to try to implement it as soon as </v>

124
00:06:05.451 --> 00:06:06.284
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I would ask everybody who's </v>

125
00:06:07.611 --> 00:06:08.444
<v Speaker 1>listening to be in a reasonably patient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine that this will take somewhere </v>

126
00:06:12.711 --> 00:06:15.050
<v Speaker 1>between a week and a month to sort out </v>
<v Speaker 1>properly.</v>

127
00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:16.443
<v Speaker 1>We're going to try to get something up </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the next week hopefully before </v>

128
00:06:19.851 --> 00:06:21.750
<v Speaker 1>Christmas if we can't manage that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

129
00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.900
<v Speaker 1>cause when you implement something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

130
00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.440
<v Speaker 1>there are technical complications that </v>
<v Speaker 1>might emerge that you don't foresee.</v>

131
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:28.633
<v Speaker 1>But I don't want people to get the </v>
<v Speaker 1>impression that we're taking this </v>

132
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.730
<v Speaker 1>lightly or lying down and that we're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking for a,</v>

133
00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:38.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a permanent alternative because we are,</v>

134
00:06:38.301 --> 00:06:40.790
<v Speaker 1>and I think we can come up with a better</v>
<v Speaker 1>alternative.</v>

135
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.860
<v Speaker 1>And that's the plan.</v>

136
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:43.811
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

137
00:06:43.811 --> 00:06:44.644
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly what I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would just add that it was like we </v>

138
00:06:46.721 --> 00:06:48.340
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were waiting for a moment.</v>

139
00:06:48.341 --> 00:06:50.920
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've watched these doors slowly closing</v>

140
00:06:50.921 --> 00:06:51.880
<v Speaker 2>on us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of us,</v>

141
00:06:51.881 --> 00:06:53.590
<v Speaker 2>whether it's twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's facebook,</v>

142
00:06:53.591 --> 00:06:55.300
<v Speaker 2>who's getting banned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's getting shadow,</v>

143
00:06:55.301 --> 00:06:57.250
<v Speaker 2>banned payment processing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything else.</v>

144
00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:00.430
<v Speaker 2>And we are taking this as seriously as </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>

145
00:07:00.431 --> 00:07:01.264
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

146
00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:02.253
<v Speaker 2>Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's working harder than anyone on the </v>

147
00:07:03.371 --> 00:07:04.204
<v Speaker 2>face of the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somehow you manage to also partly build </v>

148
00:07:07.131 --> 00:07:09.240
<v Speaker 2>the platform over the course of the past</v>
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>

149
00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:10.420
<v Speaker 2>And in the middle of all of that,</v>

150
00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:11.343
<v Speaker 1>I knew that this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we knew that this was lurking in the </v>

151
00:07:13.001 --> 00:07:15.030
<v Speaker 1>background and that this was going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>a problem.</v>

152
00:07:15.031 --> 00:07:15.864
<v Speaker 1>And Dave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've spent lots of time talking to </v>

153
00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:18.633
<v Speaker 1>investors and developers about building </v>
<v Speaker 1>alternatives to these platforms that </v>

154
00:07:22.751 --> 00:07:23.584
<v Speaker 1>seem to be willing to throw their weight</v>
<v Speaker 1>around it and increasingly arbitrary </v>

155
00:07:27.581 --> 00:07:29.370
<v Speaker 1>manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's not like it's a simple thing to</v>

156
00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:30.253
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People want somebody to say enough is </v>

157
00:07:32.631 --> 00:07:33.331
<v Speaker 2>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

158
00:07:33.331 --> 00:07:35.780
<v Speaker 2>I've mentioned this in a live stream I </v>
<v Speaker 2>did the other day,</v>

159
00:07:35.781 --> 00:07:38.080
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've watched my patrion dropped.</v>

160
00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:41.630
<v Speaker 2>We've lost around 600 patrons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think about 5,000 bucks a month.</v>

161
00:07:41.631 --> 00:07:42.464
<v Speaker 2>But in a weird way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've actually been inspired by it </v>

162
00:07:45.021 --> 00:07:46.120
<v Speaker 2>because I'm watching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

163
00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:47.063
<v Speaker 2>great for themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like on one hand people are </v>

164
00:07:49.131 --> 00:07:52.460
<v Speaker 2>emailing me and they're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm dropping my patronage and I'm really</v>

165
00:07:52.461 --> 00:07:54.740
<v Speaker 2>pissed and it's not about you and I want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to support you.</v>

166
00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:56.630
<v Speaker 2>And on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my business side is going,</v>

167
00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:58.520
<v Speaker 2>that's not great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

168
00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:00.350
<v Speaker 2>but we will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we will solve this thing.</v>

169
00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:01.620
<v Speaker 1>I have nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>

170
00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:05.040
<v Speaker 1>I've lost a thousand subscribers and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel exactly the same way.</v>

171
00:08:05.041 --> 00:08:05.551
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

172
00:08:05.551 --> 00:08:08.250
<v Speaker 1>they're telling patron to go to hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

173
00:08:08.251 --> 00:08:11.250
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not so good for me on the financial</v>

174
00:08:11.251 --> 00:08:12.084
<v Speaker 1>front,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although that's not too big a </v>

175
00:08:12.601 --> 00:08:16.040
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're taking the right stand and,</v>

176
00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:17.670
<v Speaker 1>and encouraging us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

177
00:08:17.671 --> 00:08:20.490
<v Speaker 1>or encouraging someone to do something </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this.</v>

178
00:08:20.491 --> 00:08:21.600
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

179
00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:23.530
<v Speaker 2>that's what I like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like what you said.</v>

180
00:08:23.531 --> 00:08:26.100
<v Speaker 2>If we can just ask you guys to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasonably patient,</v>

181
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:26.983
<v Speaker 2>we're talking to everybody that you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>think of and some people that you can't </v>

182
00:08:29.981 --> 00:08:30.870
<v Speaker 2>think of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>

183
00:08:30.871 --> 00:08:31.780
<v Speaker 2>we're going to fix this.</v>

184
00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:32.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

185
00:08:32.951 --> 00:08:33.784
<v Speaker 1>Well we're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least we're going to do our best </v>

186
00:08:34.871 --> 00:08:36.880
<v Speaker 1>to fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be some bumps along the</v>

187
00:08:36.881 --> 00:08:37.690
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

188
00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:40.510
<v Speaker 1>because we're now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to speed this process up to,</v>

189
00:08:40.511 --> 00:08:42.730
<v Speaker 1>so you'll have to consider this a Beta </v>
<v Speaker 1>version,</v>

190
00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.920
<v Speaker 1>but at minimum we hope to provide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

191
00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:46.023
<v Speaker 1>an easy way of switching to a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>subscription service within the next </v>

192
00:08:50.201 --> 00:08:52.210
<v Speaker 1>very short while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

193
00:08:52.211 --> 00:08:53.044
<v Speaker 1>and thank you everyone for your </v>
<v Speaker 1>continued patients and your continued </v>

194
00:08:57.121 --> 00:08:57.954
<v Speaker 1>support and your attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And your thoughts and your reaction to </v>

195
00:09:01.111 --> 00:09:02.820
<v Speaker 1>all of this and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

196
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:05.880
<v Speaker 1>it's very much appreciated and it does </v>
<v Speaker 1>help us,</v>

197
00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:10.500
<v Speaker 1>I would say maintain motivation to </v>
<v Speaker 1>continue doing this constantly.</v>

198
00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:12.810
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that I have all these patrons,</v>

199
00:09:12.811 --> 00:09:13.644
<v Speaker 1>subscribers certainly is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons that I tried to put my youtube </v>

200
00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:18.953
<v Speaker 1>channel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say first and foremost </v>

201
00:09:20.731 --> 00:09:22.820
<v Speaker 1>because it's had to take a backseat to </v>
<v Speaker 1>this lecture tour.</v>

202
00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:23.663
<v Speaker 1>But man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's way the hell up there on my </v>

203
00:09:24.901 --> 00:09:26.790
<v Speaker 1>priority list.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

204
00:09:26.791 --> 00:09:29.930
<v Speaker 1>And it gives us all sorts of flexibility</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do all sorts of things.</v>

205
00:09:29.931 --> 00:09:32.790
<v Speaker 1>That gave me a little bit of flexibility</v>
<v Speaker 1>to join you on this tour.</v>

206
00:09:32.791 --> 00:09:33.624
<v Speaker 1>So I'm incredibly humbled and </v>
<v Speaker 1>appreciative of everybody that does </v>

207
00:09:36.691 --> 00:09:38.130
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fjord and I will,</v>

208
