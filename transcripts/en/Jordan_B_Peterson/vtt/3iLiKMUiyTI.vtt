1
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.120
<v Speaker 1>So I think the best way to continue to </v>
<v Speaker 1>walk you through the,</v>

2
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.263
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thinkers that we're planning to </v>

3
00:00:21.071 --> 00:00:21.904
<v Speaker 1>cover is to do that with examples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some they stick better and they're more </v>

4
00:00:25.901 --> 00:00:26.734
<v Speaker 1>interesting and it's very difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand you outside of a narrative </v>

5
00:00:30.131 --> 00:00:33.070
<v Speaker 1>context.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm going to walk you through the</v>

6
00:00:33.071 --> 00:00:35.440
<v Speaker 1>lion king today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of you have seen the lion king?</v>

7
00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.320
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how many of you haven't?</v>

8
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.031
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

9
00:00:40.031 --> 00:00:40.864
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you obviously were raised in a box </v>

10
00:00:42.911 --> 00:00:44.290
<v Speaker 1>somewhere out in the middle of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>field.</v>

11
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.140
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

12
00:00:47.141 --> 00:00:47.561
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

13
00:00:47.561 --> 00:00:50.350
<v Speaker 1>it's an amazingly popular animated </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>

14
00:00:50.351 --> 00:00:54.580
<v Speaker 1>I think it was the most highest grossing</v>
<v Speaker 1>animated movie ever made until frozen,</v>

15
00:00:54.581 --> 00:00:58.720
<v Speaker 1>which I actually absolutely detested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the lion king,</v>

16
00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.913
<v Speaker 1>the lion king is actually consciously </v>
<v Speaker 1>influenced by archetypes as well as </v>

17
00:01:02.651 --> 00:01:05.890
<v Speaker 1>unconsciously influenced by them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a bit of a cheat,</v>

18
00:01:05.891 --> 00:01:06.850
<v Speaker 1>I would say in some sense.</v>

19
00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:07.960
<v Speaker 1>But it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

20
00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.090
<v Speaker 1>for the purposes that we're using it </v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

21
00:01:10.091 --> 00:01:13.570
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm partly,</v>

22
00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:14.643
<v Speaker 1>what you might think about is that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>its relationship to archetipal themes </v>

23
00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:19.713
<v Speaker 1>that made it so overwhelmingly popular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same being the case with say books and </v>

24
00:01:24.161 --> 00:01:27.100
<v Speaker 1>movies like Harry Potter or the entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>Marvel series.</v>

25
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.360
<v Speaker 1>The Marvel series is quite interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know somebody who wrote for Batman and</v>

26
00:01:31.361 --> 00:01:33.760
<v Speaker 1>for Wolverine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know Batman isn't a marvel comic,</v>

27
00:01:33.761 --> 00:01:37.420
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things that he told me </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was quite interesting was that once</v>

28
00:01:37.421 --> 00:01:40.690
<v Speaker 1>these characters take off and establish </v>
<v Speaker 1>a life of their own,</v>

29
00:01:40.691 --> 00:01:41.524
<v Speaker 1>they have a backstory and which becomes </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the mythology that's </v>

30
00:01:43.781 --> 00:01:45.790
<v Speaker 1>collectively held by the readers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you,</v>

31
00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.013
<v Speaker 1>you can invent an alternative universe </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you can muck about with the </v>

32
00:01:49.301 --> 00:01:51.340
<v Speaker 1>backstory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but otherwise you better stick with it.</v>

33
00:01:51.341 --> 00:01:52.174
<v Speaker 1>Or the readers are going to write you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and tell you that you've got the story </v>

34
00:01:53.981 --> 00:01:54.280
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

35
00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.113
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a bit of a collaboration </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the writers and the readers </v>

36
00:01:57.731 --> 00:01:59.770
<v Speaker 1>after these things take on a life of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own.</v>

37
00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.270
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course the,</v>

38
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:03.880
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tend to,</v>

39
00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.080
<v Speaker 1>the comic books in particular tend to </v>
<v Speaker 1>tend towards mythological themes very,</v>

40
00:02:08.081 --> 00:02:10.240
<v Speaker 1>very rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so anyways,</v>

41
00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.700
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carl Young was a fascinating person.</v>

42
00:02:12.701 --> 00:02:16.870
<v Speaker 1>I think you can read his biography,</v>
<v Speaker 1>autobiography slash,</v>

43
00:02:16.871 --> 00:02:18.280
<v Speaker 1>biography,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is called memories,</v>

44
00:02:18.281 --> 00:02:19.114
<v Speaker 1>dreams and reflections,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which in many ways I think is an </v>

45
00:02:21.071 --> 00:02:24.970
<v Speaker 1>unfortunate book because it's usually </v>
<v Speaker 1>the only book that people read that that</v>

46
00:02:24.971 --> 00:02:25.804
<v Speaker 1>is more or less by young but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it is more popularly at popularly </v>

47
00:02:29.591 --> 00:02:31.480
<v Speaker 1>accessible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is probably a good thing,</v>

48
00:02:31.481 --> 00:02:33.270
<v Speaker 1>but it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

49
00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.160
<v Speaker 1>it's not as rigorous as his other books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

50
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:37.403
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem with someone like young as </v>

51
00:02:38.441 --> 00:02:39.274
<v Speaker 1>you kind of have to read them as much as</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can in the original because </v>

52
00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.470
<v Speaker 1>interpreting him is not a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>straightforward forward matter.</v>

53
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:45.733
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a very visionary person by which </v>

54
00:02:48.191 --> 00:02:52.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean he had an incredible visual </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagination and he used that a lot.</v>

55
00:02:52.091 --> 00:02:52.924
<v Speaker 1>He used it in his therapy practice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that most of his therapy </v>

56
00:02:56.111 --> 00:02:58.750
<v Speaker 1>clients were high in trade openness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

57
00:02:58.751 --> 00:03:01.030
<v Speaker 1>I have lot of clients who are high in </v>
<v Speaker 1>trait openness.</v>

58
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.290
<v Speaker 1>They kind of seek me out because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>high in trade openness and you know,</v>

59
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.120
<v Speaker 1>they watch my videos and that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and they're interested in what I'm</v>

60
00:03:07.121 --> 00:03:11.350
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And many of them are are astute dreamers</v>

61
00:03:11.351 --> 00:03:12.184
<v Speaker 1>and prolific dreamers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And many open people in my experience </v>

62
00:03:14.921 --> 00:03:15.754
<v Speaker 1>have archetipal dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas people who are lower and </v>

63
00:03:17.621 --> 00:03:18.454
<v Speaker 1>openness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they either don't dream at all or they </v>

64
00:03:19.691 --> 00:03:20.524
<v Speaker 1>don't remember their dreams as much or </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not interested in them and </v>

65
00:03:23.381 --> 00:03:26.020
<v Speaker 1>they're not interested in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mythological underpinnings of them.</v>

66
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:27.183
<v Speaker 1>So I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've taught psychology roughly speaking </v>

67
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:31.533
<v Speaker 1>to many different types of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including lawyers and lawyers and </v>

68
00:03:34.331 --> 00:03:35.164
<v Speaker 1>physicians and they tend to be higher in</v>
<v Speaker 1>trait conscientiousness then in </v>

69
00:03:37.841 --> 00:03:38.674
<v Speaker 1>openness.</v>

70
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.460
<v Speaker 1>And they're much more interested in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>practical applications of psychology and</v>

71
00:03:42.461 --> 00:03:45.400
<v Speaker 1>maybe the big five theories than they </v>
<v Speaker 1>are in the narrative underpinnings.</v>

72
00:03:45.401 --> 00:03:48.800
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people say that when they went to union,</v>

73
00:03:48.801 --> 00:03:51.130
<v Speaker 1>they had union dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't.</v>

74
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.140
<v Speaker 1>And then when they went to Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had Friday and dreams.</v>

75
00:03:53.141 --> 00:03:55.480
<v Speaker 1>And I don't really believe that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly true.</v>

76
00:03:55.481 --> 00:03:57.310
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a matter of selection </v>
<v Speaker 1>bias,</v>

77
00:03:57.311 --> 00:03:58.144
<v Speaker 1>a priori selection bias on the part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the people who were likely to go see </v>

78
00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.460
<v Speaker 1>either of those two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

79
00:04:03.461 --> 00:04:04.294
<v Speaker 1>but I've been struck by some clients in </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular how unbelievably continually </v>

80
00:04:09.161 --> 00:04:09.994
<v Speaker 1>they can generate deep archetypal dreams</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a really coherent narrative </v>

81
00:04:13.241 --> 00:04:15.340
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really phenomenal.</v>

82
00:04:15.341 --> 00:04:16.174
<v Speaker 1>And how revealing those dreams are </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem with archetipal dreams is that </v>

83
00:04:18.851 --> 00:04:20.260
<v Speaker 1>they're not really personal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

84
00:04:20.261 --> 00:04:21.094
<v Speaker 1>So if you're looking for a personal way </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of a situation and archetipal dream </v>

85
00:04:23.981 --> 00:04:24.814
<v Speaker 1>doesn't help you that much because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>gives you the general pattern rather </v>

86
00:04:26.891 --> 00:04:28.750
<v Speaker 1>than a specific solution to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

87
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.380
<v Speaker 1>But a good dream will do both at once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>

88
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.940
<v Speaker 1>A young was an astute student of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud's,</v>

89
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:37.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll cover freud next.</v>

90
00:04:37.811 --> 00:04:40.240
<v Speaker 1>Although generally in personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>courses the,</v>

91
00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:41.483
<v Speaker 1>the order is reversed Freud first and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can because of their temporal </v>

92
00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.380
<v Speaker 1>of the temporal order of their thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

93
00:04:47.381 --> 00:04:48.214
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's better to start with young </v>

94
00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.330
<v Speaker 1>because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's as if you,</v>

95
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.600
<v Speaker 1>Freud excavated into the basement and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then young excavated into many,</v>

96
00:04:55.601 --> 00:04:58.240
<v Speaker 1>many floors underneath the basement of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mind.</v>

97
00:04:58.241 --> 00:04:59.074
<v Speaker 1>And so from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're transitioning from an archaic </v>

98
00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.420
<v Speaker 1>understanding of archaic modes of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking towards Freud,</v>

99
00:05:04.421 --> 00:05:06.580
<v Speaker 1>it's better to go through yield because </v>
<v Speaker 1>young is,</v>

100
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:07.773
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Freud in theory is a subset of </v>

101
00:05:09.821 --> 00:05:10.654
<v Speaker 1>union theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally just like Newtonian </v>

102
00:05:12.281 --> 00:05:17.200
<v Speaker 1>physics is a subset of Einsteinian </v>
<v Speaker 1>physics and I think that Freud knew that</v>

103
00:05:17.201 --> 00:05:20.560
<v Speaker 1>even to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although he was very much opposed to any</v>

104
00:05:20.561 --> 00:05:24.280
<v Speaker 1>sort of religious thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mythological religious thinking,</v>

105
00:05:24.281 --> 00:05:25.114
<v Speaker 1>I would say he was a real 19th century </v>
<v Speaker 1>materialist and he didn't like the fact </v>

106
00:05:28.841 --> 00:05:29.674
<v Speaker 1>that humans work started to delve into </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious themes in a manner that </v>

107
00:05:33.731 --> 00:05:36.130
<v Speaker 1>actually in some sense validated those </v>
<v Speaker 1>themes.</v>

108
00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:36.963
<v Speaker 1>And so that's actually why they split.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They split when you published a book </v>

109
00:05:39.131 --> 00:05:43.690
<v Speaker 1>called symbols of transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human was also a deep student of nature.</v>

110
00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.823
<v Speaker 1>Nature wrote a book called [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of an old testament </v>

111
00:05:48.101 --> 00:05:49.990
<v Speaker 1>revelation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poetry kind of book.</v>

112
00:05:49.991 --> 00:05:50.824
<v Speaker 1>It's a strange one and I wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>recommend if you want to read Nietzsche </v>

113
00:05:53.261 --> 00:05:55.480
<v Speaker 1>that you start with that one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most people do.</v>

114
00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.660
<v Speaker 1>But you get a seminar on thus spake </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sarah through Sta,</v>

115
00:05:59.661 --> 00:06:01.850
<v Speaker 1>which is about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got this wrong,</v>

116
00:06:01.851 --> 00:06:02.684
<v Speaker 1>it's somewhere between 700 and 1100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>pages long and it only covers the first </v>

117
00:06:06.141 --> 00:06:06.974
<v Speaker 1>third of the book and thus spake Sarah </v>
<v Speaker 1>Theaster is actually quite a short book </v>

118
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:10.993
<v Speaker 1>and so well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can imagine how much you had to </v>

119
00:06:13.701 --> 00:06:14.534
<v Speaker 1>know about Nicha to derive that many </v>
<v Speaker 1>words out of that few words and nature </v>

120
00:06:19.041 --> 00:06:19.880
<v Speaker 1>was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

121
00:06:19.881 --> 00:06:20.714
<v Speaker 1>an absolute absolute genius and young </v>
<v Speaker 1>was actually trying to answer the </v>

122
00:06:25.011 --> 00:06:27.290
<v Speaker 1>question that Nietzsche posed </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally,</v>

123
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.610
<v Speaker 1>which is why part of the reason why it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>incorrect historically to consider him a</v>

124
00:06:31.611 --> 00:06:33.710
<v Speaker 1>freud and he was so niche.</v>

125
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:34.543
<v Speaker 1>It basically stated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say explicitly that scientific </v>

126
00:06:39.051 --> 00:06:39.884
<v Speaker 1>empiricism slash rationalism had </v>
<v Speaker 1>resulted in the death of the </v>

127
00:06:42.891 --> 00:06:45.350
<v Speaker 1>mythological tradition of the west,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>

128
00:06:45.351 --> 00:06:48.260
<v Speaker 1>That's niche comment on the death of </v>
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>

129
00:06:48.261 --> 00:06:49.094
<v Speaker 1>And in that comment he also said that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that God was dead was going to </v>

130
00:06:52.581 --> 00:06:53.414
<v Speaker 1>produce tremendous ideational and social</v>
<v Speaker 1>historical upheavals that would result </v>

131
00:06:58.101 --> 00:06:58.934
<v Speaker 1>in the deaths of millions of people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he didn't say all that in one </v>

132
00:07:02.031 --> 00:07:02.541
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

133
00:07:02.541 --> 00:07:03.374
<v Speaker 1>it's spread between,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of it's in will to power and I </v>

134
00:07:07.401 --> 00:07:08.900
<v Speaker 1>can't remember the source of the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

135
00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:09.973
<v Speaker 1>Some of it's referenced in [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Nietzsche believed that in order to </v>

136
00:07:14.001 --> 00:07:17.630
<v Speaker 1>overcome that collapse of traditional </v>
<v Speaker 1>values with the idea,</v>

137
00:07:17.631 --> 00:07:18.464
<v Speaker 1>say of God as its cornerstone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people would have to become creatures </v>

138
00:07:22.791 --> 00:07:25.790
<v Speaker 1>that could produce their own values as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>replacement,</v>

139
00:07:25.791 --> 00:07:30.490
<v Speaker 1>that we would have to become capable of </v>
<v Speaker 1>generating autonomous values and young.</v>

140
00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:33.470
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's easier said than done because</v>

141
00:07:33.471 --> 00:07:34.304
<v Speaker 1>trying to impose a set of values on </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself is very difficult because </v>

142
00:07:36.621 --> 00:07:37.454
<v Speaker 1>you're not very cooperative and you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you try to get yourself to do </v>

143
00:07:39.711 --> 00:07:42.050
<v Speaker 1>something that you don't want to do or </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's hard,</v>

144
00:07:42.051 --> 00:07:45.140
<v Speaker 1>you just won't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's not like you can just invent</v>

145
00:07:45.141 --> 00:07:46.940
<v Speaker 1>your own values and then go along with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

146
00:07:46.941 --> 00:07:47.774
<v Speaker 1>That just doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what young and the Floridians </v>

147
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:51.530
<v Speaker 1>did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud first I would say,</v>

148
00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:54.650
<v Speaker 1>was to start looking into looking into </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's fantasies,</v>

149
00:07:54.651 --> 00:07:55.484
<v Speaker 1>autonomous fantasies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious fantasies to see if they </v>

150
00:07:57.951 --> 00:07:58.784
<v Speaker 1>could to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and and discovered that values bubbled </v>

151
00:08:02.631 --> 00:08:05.660
<v Speaker 1>up of their own accord into those </v>
<v Speaker 1>fantasies.</v>

152
00:08:05.661 --> 00:08:06.860
<v Speaker 1>And you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

153
00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:07.694
<v Speaker 1>if you've become enamored of someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you might start fantasizing about </v>

154
00:08:10.611 --> 00:08:12.230
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you read off the fantasy,</v>

155
00:08:12.231 --> 00:08:14.420
<v Speaker 1>then you can tell what you're after and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're up to.</v>

156
00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:15.253
<v Speaker 1>And so the motivational force composes </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fantasy and fried was more </v>

157
00:08:19.371 --> 00:08:21.140
<v Speaker 1>interested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not in a personal sense.</v>

158
00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:24.080
<v Speaker 1>So in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in so far as your fantasies might reveal</v>

159
00:08:24.081 --> 00:08:25.970
<v Speaker 1>your personal history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

160
00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.820
<v Speaker 1>if you have a burst of negative emotion </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a clinical session,</v>

161
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:29.833
<v Speaker 1>there'll be a fantasy that goes along </v>
<v Speaker 1>with that and an association of ideas </v>

162
00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:33.260
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

163
00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.960
<v Speaker 1>that kind of manifest themselves of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own accord.</v>

164
00:08:35.961 --> 00:08:39.080
<v Speaker 1>And they're not necessarily coherent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>logical third link by emotion.</v>

165
00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.110
<v Speaker 1>That's the free association technique in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freudian Psychology.</v>

166
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:45.080
<v Speaker 1>And they also might manifest themselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>in dreams and fantasies.</v>

167
00:08:45.081 --> 00:08:48.980
<v Speaker 1>And so Freud started doing the analysis </v>
<v Speaker 1>of these spontaneous,</v>

168
00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:49.843
<v Speaker 1>let's call them fantasies and Ewan </v>
<v Speaker 1>linked that more Freud did this first </v>

169
00:08:53.391 --> 00:08:54.224
<v Speaker 1>with the depaul oedipal complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you linked up spontaneous </v>

170
00:08:57.631 --> 00:08:59.730
<v Speaker 1>fantasies and dreams with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with myth,</v>

171
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:00.623
<v Speaker 1>mythology and fantasy across history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course piaget did the same thing </v>

172
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.240
<v Speaker 1>from a completely different standpoint.</v>

173
00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:07.253
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that a lot of that's embedded in </v>

174
00:09:07.861 --> 00:09:08.694
<v Speaker 1>this movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we might as well just walk through </v>

175
00:09:09.691 --> 00:09:10.650
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

176
00:09:10.651 --> 00:09:13.470
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first question might be,</v>

177
00:09:13.471 --> 00:09:14.940
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is a lion and king,</v>

178
00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.470
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because that'd be,</v>

179
00:09:16.471 --> 00:09:18.670
<v Speaker 1>it makes sense to people that aligned </v>
<v Speaker 1>could be a king.</v>

180
00:09:18.671 --> 00:09:20.820
<v Speaker 1>And of course a lion is an apex </v>
<v Speaker 1>predator.</v>

181
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:22.013
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means it's at the top of the food </v>

182
00:09:23.161 --> 00:09:24.210
<v Speaker 1>chain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>

183
00:09:24.211 --> 00:09:27.480
<v Speaker 1>And it's sort of golden like the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's also useful.</v>

184
00:09:27.481 --> 00:09:28.314
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has that main that makes it look </v>

185
00:09:29.431 --> 00:09:30.264
<v Speaker 1>majestic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course it's very physically </v>

186
00:09:31.261 --> 00:09:33.190
<v Speaker 1>powerful and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

187
00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:35.820
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's intimidating.</v>

188
00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:38.490
<v Speaker 1>And so it's something that you run away </v>
<v Speaker 1>from as well.</v>

189
00:09:38.491 --> 00:09:41.130
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you're awestruck by the fact that,</v>

190
00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.113
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like snail king just doesn't make </v>

191
00:09:43.321 --> 00:09:44.160
<v Speaker 1>any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

192
00:09:44.161 --> 00:09:45.580
<v Speaker 1>But Lion King,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that works.</v>

193
00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:49.740
<v Speaker 1>And you got to think about those things </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's not self evident why a lion</v>

194
00:09:49.741 --> 00:09:50.970
<v Speaker 1>would work as a king,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a,</v>

195
00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:52.500
<v Speaker 1>but a snail wouldn't.</v>

196
00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:56.910
<v Speaker 1>But it fits in with your metaphorical </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding of the way the world works</v>

197
00:09:56.911 --> 00:09:57.744
<v Speaker 1>much better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the lion king makes sense and </v>

198
00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.313
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when things like that that aren't </v>

199
00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:03.773
<v Speaker 1>rationally self evident makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to ask yourself in what </v>

200
00:10:06.871 --> 00:10:10.320
<v Speaker 1>metaphorical context do they make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have the lion king.</v>

201
00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:15.570
<v Speaker 1>Now the movie opens with a sunrise and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sunrise is equivalent to the dawn of</v>

202
00:10:15.571 --> 00:10:18.330
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that in many archaic stories,</v>

203
00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:22.680
<v Speaker 1>the son was a hero like horace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>

204
00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:27.690
<v Speaker 1>was a solar king</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apollo in particular,</v>

205
00:10:27.691 --> 00:10:32.130
<v Speaker 1>but Apollo Greek Greek myth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea was that the sun was,</v>

206
00:10:32.131 --> 00:10:33.900
<v Speaker 1>this was the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

207
00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.033
<v Speaker 1>the hero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hero who illuminated the sky in the </v>

208
00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:38.573
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so here are wisdom and illumination </v>

209
00:10:39.871 --> 00:10:42.630
<v Speaker 1>and enlightenment are all tangled </v>
<v Speaker 1>together metaphorically.</v>

210
00:10:42.631 --> 00:10:45.900
<v Speaker 1>And then at night what would happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be that son would fight with the,</v>

211
00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:46.853
<v Speaker 1>with the dragon of darkness basically or</v>
<v Speaker 1>with evil all night and then rise again </v>

212
00:10:50.731 --> 00:10:51.990
<v Speaker 1>victorious in the morning.</v>

213
00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:53.940
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a death and rebirth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The minutes,</v>

214
00:10:53.941 --> 00:10:54.880
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very cold,</v>

215
00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:56.820
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very common mythological theme.</v>

216
00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:00.450
<v Speaker 1>And the reason the sun is associated </v>
<v Speaker 1>with consciousness as far as I can tell,</v>

217
00:11:00.451 --> 00:11:02.820
<v Speaker 1>is that we're not nocturnal creatures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

218
00:11:02.821 --> 00:11:04.650
<v Speaker 1>We are awake during the day and we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

219
00:11:04.651 --> 00:11:05.484
<v Speaker 1>very visual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Half our brain is devoted to visual </v>

220
00:11:06.901 --> 00:11:10.890
<v Speaker 1>processing and to be a lightened and </v>
<v Speaker 1>illuminated means to develop,</v>

221
00:11:10.891 --> 00:11:13.500
<v Speaker 1>to move towards a higher state of </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

222
00:11:13.501 --> 00:11:17.580
<v Speaker 1>And we naturally use light symbolism to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to represent that,</v>

223
00:11:17.581 --> 00:11:18.414
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the light bulb on the top of </v>

224
00:11:19.051 --> 00:11:20.460
<v Speaker 1>someone's head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

225
00:11:20.461 --> 00:11:24.180
<v Speaker 1>you don't say I was in dark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you learn something new,</v>

226
00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.313
<v Speaker 1>and so again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that fits into this underlying </v>

227
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:31.080
<v Speaker 1>metaphorical substrate that that's I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think deeply biologically grounded,</v>

228
00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:33.870
<v Speaker 1>but also sociology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>socially grounded.</v>

229
00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.360
<v Speaker 1>So it's a new day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the start of a new day.</v>

230
00:11:36.361 --> 00:11:39.360
<v Speaker 1>And a day day actually means like </v>
<v Speaker 1>French.</v>

231
00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:42.960
<v Speaker 1>Your Nae Means Day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the day trek in some sense.</v>

232
00:11:42.961 --> 00:11:46.810
<v Speaker 1>And how to comport yourself during the </v>
<v Speaker 1>day is the fundamental question.</v>

233
00:11:46.811 --> 00:11:48.990
<v Speaker 1>And the day is the canonical unit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

234
00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:52.440
<v Speaker 1>And so you have to know how to comport </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself during the day.</v>

235
00:11:52.441 --> 00:11:53.274
<v Speaker 1>And part of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a journey from consciousness into </v>

236
00:11:54.701 --> 00:11:55.870
<v Speaker 1>unconsciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

237
00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:58.300
<v Speaker 1>and that return.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like a Paulo,</v>

238
00:11:58.400 --> 00:11:59.240
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've,</v>

239
00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:02.200
<v Speaker 1>you descend into unconsciousness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then reemerge.</v>

240
00:12:02.201 --> 00:12:04.150
<v Speaker 1>And of course that's not metaphorical at</v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

241
00:12:04.151 --> 00:12:04.984
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You descend into the underworld of </v>

242
00:12:07.121 --> 00:12:10.270
<v Speaker 1>darkness and dreams and strange things </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened out there.</v>

243
00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:11.860
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you awake.</v>

244
00:12:11.861 --> 00:12:14.890
<v Speaker 1>If you're fortunate or unfortunate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on your state of mind,</v>

245
00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:17.560
<v Speaker 1>you will wake in the morning and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>new day,</v>

246
00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:21.040
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the dream world seems to help you</v>

247
00:12:21.041 --> 00:12:22.690
<v Speaker 1>sort out your thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

248
00:12:22.691 --> 00:12:25.150
<v Speaker 1>if you keep people awake for an extended</v>
<v Speaker 1>period of time,</v>

249
00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:26.343
<v Speaker 1>then they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

250
00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:27.820
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

251
00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.530
<v Speaker 1>they lose their minds essentially.</v>

252
00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:30.633
<v Speaker 1>The dream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the unconsciousness and the dream state </v>

253
00:12:32.741 --> 00:12:35.170
<v Speaker 1>seem absolutely critical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the maintenance of mental health,</v>

254
00:12:35.171 --> 00:12:36.004
<v Speaker 1>although people don't exactly understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>why it looks like dreams might help you </v>

255
00:12:39.131 --> 00:12:41.800
<v Speaker 1>forget because forgetting is really </v>
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

256
00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:42.663
<v Speaker 1>You just can't wait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just can't remember everything that </v>

257
00:12:45.191 --> 00:12:46.870
<v Speaker 1>happened to you get so damn cluttered </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

258
00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:48.970
<v Speaker 1>that you'd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd fall apart.</v>

259
00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:51.700
<v Speaker 1>And so you reduce things to the just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when you're doing that,</v>

260
00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:52.743
<v Speaker 1>you pack them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you compress them in some </v>

261
00:12:54.041 --> 00:12:54.874
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You pack them into a smaller space and </v>

262
00:12:56.111 --> 00:12:57.670
<v Speaker 1>get rid of everything that isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>relevant.</v>

263
00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:00.640
<v Speaker 1>And the dream seems to now be part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

264
00:13:00.641 --> 00:13:01.474
<v Speaker 1>It also seems to be a place where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>deeply encode learning that might've </v>

265
00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:04.713
<v Speaker 1>been done that day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is something that Freud actually </v>

266
00:13:06.461 --> 00:13:09.100
<v Speaker 1>noted in his interpretation of dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a great book.</v>

267
00:13:09.101 --> 00:13:11.230
<v Speaker 1>If you're ever going to read a book that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud wrote,</v>

268
00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:14.710
<v Speaker 1>the interpretation of dreams is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>proper one to read in my estimation.</v>

269
00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:18.100
<v Speaker 1>It's a brilliant book and it laid the </v>
<v Speaker 1>groundwork for a lot of what you did.</v>

270
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:19.833
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how the movie starts and the </v>

271
00:13:21.191 --> 00:13:22.990
<v Speaker 1>animals come out into the light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

272
00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.620
<v Speaker 1>that's a metaphor for the dawning of </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness to come out into the light</v>

273
00:13:26.621 --> 00:13:30.850
<v Speaker 1>where you can see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so this is a baby giraffe and babies</v>

274
00:13:30.851 --> 00:13:32.770
<v Speaker 1>emerge into the light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>

275
00:13:32.771 --> 00:13:34.060
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like I said,</v>

276
00:13:34.061 --> 00:13:34.894
<v Speaker 1>that that's a representation of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the emergence or expansion of </v>

277
00:13:37.841 --> 00:13:39.850
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so this is how the movie starts.</v>

278
00:13:39.851 --> 00:13:42.310
<v Speaker 1>It starts with very expansive music as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

279
00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:46.150
<v Speaker 1>celebratory music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's to indicate to you to set the</v>

280
00:13:46.151 --> 00:13:46.984
<v Speaker 1>tone for the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also to indicate to you that you're </v>

281
00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:52.990
<v Speaker 1>about to watch something of import.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the opening scene is actually a real</v>

282
00:13:52.991 --> 00:13:53.824
<v Speaker 1>scene of genius in my estimation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The animators did a great job and it </v>

283
00:13:56.021 --> 00:13:57.610
<v Speaker 1>goes along very nicely with the music.</v>

284
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.650
<v Speaker 1>And so you see this lit place and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you see this rock pride rock,</v>

285
00:14:02.651 --> 00:14:04.810
<v Speaker 1>I believe it's called in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

286
00:14:04.811 --> 00:14:06.580
<v Speaker 1>and it's the center.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the center.</v>

287
00:14:06.581 --> 00:14:08.740
<v Speaker 1>It's like the spot that's marked by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cathedral,</v>

288
00:14:08.741 --> 00:14:11.410
<v Speaker 1>which is an x or across,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're right in the middle of that.</v>

289
00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:14.740
<v Speaker 1>And so it's the center of the light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another way of thinking about it.</v>

290
00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:19.690
<v Speaker 1>Or it's the center of the territory or </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the home or it's the fire in the in</v>

291
00:14:19.691 --> 00:14:22.540
<v Speaker 1>the wilderness or it's the tree in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>center where you live.</v>

292
00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:26.170
<v Speaker 1>It's all of those things at once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's inhabited territory with you at the</v>

293
00:14:26.171 --> 00:14:27.004
<v Speaker 1>center and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rock represents tradition because </v>

294
00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:31.173
<v Speaker 1>people tend to inscribe their traditions</v>
<v Speaker 1>on rock right or two to build them into </v>

295
00:14:35.351 --> 00:14:36.184
<v Speaker 1>rock like the pyramid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could think about that as a </v>

296
00:14:37.571 --> 00:14:39.310
<v Speaker 1>pyramid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an Egyptian pyramid,</v>

297
00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:40.930
<v Speaker 1>and it's the right way to think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

298
00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:42.003
<v Speaker 1>You could also think about it as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy with the apex </v>

299
00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:46.150
<v Speaker 1>Predator at the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the line.</v>

300
00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:49.420
<v Speaker 1>So it makes sense that the lion would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the light on the rock.</v>

301
00:14:49.421 --> 00:14:51.590
<v Speaker 1>That's a pyramid in the middle of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>territory.</v>

302
00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:52.783
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense to people </v>

303
00:14:53.331 --> 00:14:56.420
<v Speaker 1>psychologically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because that's what the state is,</v>

304
00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:57.343
<v Speaker 1>the state is a hierarchy with with </v>
<v Speaker 1>something at the top that occupies a </v>

305
00:15:00.831 --> 00:15:04.550
<v Speaker 1>space that has been illuminated and made</v>
<v Speaker 1>safe by consciousness.</v>

306
00:15:04.551 --> 00:15:07.550
<v Speaker 1>That's what the state is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's all represented right away in</v>

307
00:15:07.551 --> 00:15:08.384
<v Speaker 1>this movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all the animals come to to observe </v>

308
00:15:11.421 --> 00:15:12.254
<v Speaker 1>what's happening in the pyramid and at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the top because they need to know what </v>

309
00:15:14.841 --> 00:15:18.110
<v Speaker 1>happens as at the top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly to organize their world.</v>

310
00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:19.123
<v Speaker 1>That's the pyramid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also to see how the organizational </v>

311
00:15:21.501 --> 00:15:24.140
<v Speaker 1>principle works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why they're all gathering.</v>

312
00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:25.243
<v Speaker 1>And so they're gathering in the light in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the morning to observe something new </v>

313
00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:31.490
<v Speaker 1>that's going to be born that's of </v>
<v Speaker 1>significant importance.</v>

314
00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:36.020
<v Speaker 1>And that's the birth of the hero and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this little bird here Zazu right?</v>

315
00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:39.590
<v Speaker 1>It's the zoo is like horus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Egyptian God who was a falcon.</v>

316
00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:40.633
<v Speaker 1>And an eye at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is the king's eye in this king's </v>

317
00:15:44.391 --> 00:15:45.530
<v Speaker 1>eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this movie,</v>

318
00:15:45.531 --> 00:15:48.260
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He flies up above outside of the pyramid</v>

319
00:15:48.261 --> 00:15:51.320
<v Speaker 1>so he can see everything that goes on </v>
<v Speaker 1>and reports to the king.</v>

320
00:15:51.321 --> 00:15:52.154
<v Speaker 1>And so partly what that indicates is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the thing that's at the top of the </v>

321
00:15:55.131 --> 00:15:55.964
<v Speaker 1>pyramid needs to be an eye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly why you see an eye on </v>

322
00:15:58.731 --> 00:16:01.280
<v Speaker 1>the top of the pyramid on the back of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the American dollar bill.</v>

323
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:02.263
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly the same idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or if you look at the Washington </v>

324
00:16:04.161 --> 00:16:05.930
<v Speaker 1>Monument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a pyramid at the top,</v>

325
00:16:05.931 --> 00:16:08.780
<v Speaker 1>you see that it's capped with aluminum </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you think,</v>

326
00:16:08.781 --> 00:16:09.710
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why aluminum?</v>

327
00:16:09.711 --> 00:16:12.740
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that was it was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most expensive metal at that time.</v>

328
00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:15.530
<v Speaker 1>And so the notion is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that at the top of the pyramid,</v>

329
00:16:15.531 --> 00:16:18.680
<v Speaker 1>there's something that actually doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>belong in the pyramid.</v>

330
00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:22.250
<v Speaker 1>It's something that goes up above the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pyramid and can see everything.</v>

331
00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:24.050
<v Speaker 1>And so you could think about it this </v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

332
00:16:24.051 --> 00:16:26.510
<v Speaker 1>is that you're going to be in a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>pyramids in your life,</v>

333
00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:29.780
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and different states and families.</v>

334
00:16:29.781 --> 00:16:33.440
<v Speaker 1>And all of that and they'll arrange </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves into a hierarchy and there'll</v>

335
00:16:33.441 --> 00:16:34.274
<v Speaker 1>be something at the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the top is the thing that can do </v>

336
00:16:36.471 --> 00:16:37.304
<v Speaker 1>well across hierarchies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not stuck in any one pyramid at </v>

337
00:16:40.551 --> 00:16:44.600
<v Speaker 1>10 it's partly associated with vision </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the ability to see a long,</v>

338
00:16:44.601 --> 00:16:45.434
<v Speaker 1>long distance also to see what you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to see and to report that back to </v>

339
00:16:48.711 --> 00:16:50.780
<v Speaker 1>the king.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the king,</v>

340
00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:51.733
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as you guys are concerned from a </v>

341
00:16:53.991 --> 00:16:56.510
<v Speaker 1>psychological perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's your Super Ego.</v>

342
00:16:56.690 --> 00:17:00.230
<v Speaker 1>That's the Freudian perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or it might be the moral system by which</v>

343
00:17:00.231 --> 00:17:03.860
<v Speaker 1>you comport yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but your eyes are the thing that updates</v>

344
00:17:03.861 --> 00:17:04.430
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

345
00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:06.290
<v Speaker 1>You need it to Orient Yourself in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

346
00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:09.110
<v Speaker 1>You need it to Orient Yourself among </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people,</v>

347
00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:12.320
<v Speaker 1>but your eye and your capacity to pay </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention,</v>

348
00:17:12.321 --> 00:17:13.154
<v Speaker 1>especially to what you don't want to pay</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to is the thing that </v>

349
00:17:15.681 --> 00:17:16.514
<v Speaker 1>continually updates that model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly as piaget laid out with </v>

350
00:17:18.951 --> 00:17:20.150
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

351
00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:22.910
<v Speaker 1>and all of that's packed into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagery in the first,</v>

352
00:17:23.090 --> 00:17:24.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>few minutes of this movie.</v>

353
00:17:24.771 --> 00:17:27.410
<v Speaker 1>And that's actually why it really relies</v>
<v Speaker 1>on imagery.</v>

354
00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:30.110
<v Speaker 1>Why this isn't just a lecture by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologist.</v>

355
00:17:30.111 --> 00:17:32.930
<v Speaker 1>You know when you go to see the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because the images,</v>

356
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:35.000
<v Speaker 1>they say a picture is worth a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 1>words,</v>

357
00:17:35.001 --> 00:17:35.834
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's thousands of pictures in </v>

358
00:17:37.341 --> 00:17:38.174
<v Speaker 1>this movie obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe a picture is worth more words </v>

359
00:17:40.641 --> 00:17:43.250
<v Speaker 1>than you can actually use to describe </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

360
00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:46.940
<v Speaker 1>If the picture is is profound enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we have many,</v>

361
00:17:46.941 --> 00:17:47.774
<v Speaker 1>many pictures like that and he deeply </v>
<v Speaker 1>picture is virtually inexhaustible in </v>

362
00:17:51.871 --> 00:17:55.950
<v Speaker 1>terms of its semantically with regards </v>
<v Speaker 1>to its explanation.</v>

363
00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:58.020
<v Speaker 1>Images are very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very dense.</v>

364
00:17:58.021 --> 00:17:59.760
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the animals all gathered.</v>

365
00:17:59.761 --> 00:18:03.210
<v Speaker 1>Now the animals are also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had representations from the Freud in</v>

366
00:18:03.211 --> 00:18:04.044
<v Speaker 1>perspective and the Ed is the part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your psyche from the Freudian </v>

367
00:18:06.571 --> 00:18:08.670
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's animalistic and,</v>

368
00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:10.020
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and full of,</v>

369
00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:12.240
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of implicit drives,</v>

370
00:18:12.241 --> 00:18:15.930
<v Speaker 1>sexual and aggressive in particular as </v>
<v Speaker 1>far as Freud was concerned.</v>

371
00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:16.943
<v Speaker 1>And that's because those two drives say </v>
<v Speaker 1>unlike thirst or hunger are much more </v>

372
00:18:20.581 --> 00:18:25.380
<v Speaker 1>difficult to integrate into proper </v>
<v Speaker 1>social being and tend to be excluded and</v>

373
00:18:25.381 --> 00:18:28.590
<v Speaker 1>left unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so a lot of Friday and psychology,</v>

374
00:18:28.591 --> 00:18:29.424
<v Speaker 1>and I would say psychology in general is</v>
<v Speaker 1>focused on the integration of sexual </v>

375
00:18:33.241 --> 00:18:35.880
<v Speaker 1>impulses and aggressive impulses into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the psyche.</v>

376
00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:40.890
<v Speaker 1>I would also add to that anxiety because</v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety is also a major problem.</v>

377
00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:45.630
<v Speaker 1>Anxiety and negative emotion that's pain</v>
<v Speaker 1>like is also a major problem for people.</v>

378
00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:46.643
<v Speaker 1>And so the animals represent those ed </v>
<v Speaker 1>like impulses that have to be organized </v>

379
00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:54.730
<v Speaker 1>hierarchically before you can become an </v>
<v Speaker 1>integrated being in precisely the piaget</v>

380
00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:55.501
<v Speaker 1>had manner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

381
00:18:55.501 --> 00:18:56.880
<v Speaker 1>Because Piaget would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

382
00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.073
<v Speaker 1>the child comes into the world with </v>
<v Speaker 1>reflexes and maybe a more modern </v>

383
00:19:00.661 --> 00:19:04.620
<v Speaker 1>psychologists would also con concentrate</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the implicit motivations.</v>

384
00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:08.610
<v Speaker 1>And those have to be organized inside </v>
<v Speaker 1>the child into some kind of hierarchy of</v>

385
00:19:08.611 --> 00:19:13.410
<v Speaker 1>unity before the child can organize him </v>
<v Speaker 1>or herself into the broader unity of the</v>

386
00:19:13.411 --> 00:19:14.244
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's basically what's being </v>

387
00:19:15.151 --> 00:19:17.010
<v Speaker 1>represented here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

388
00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:22.260
<v Speaker 1>so Zazu the eyes of the king comes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>checkout the king,</v>

389
00:19:22.261 --> 00:19:25.920
<v Speaker 1>and that's what's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the king's name?</v>

390
00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:27.450
<v Speaker 1>Mufasa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

391
00:19:27.451 --> 00:19:29.520
<v Speaker 1>And he is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had a very regal looking person,</v>

392
00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:32.490
<v Speaker 1>a lion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he stands up straight and tall.</v>

393
00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:33.323
<v Speaker 1>And that means that he's high in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Serotonin because Saratonin governs </v>

394
00:19:35.671 --> 00:19:37.050
<v Speaker 1>posture reflection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if so,</v>

395
00:19:37.051 --> 00:19:39.510
<v Speaker 1>if you're dominant and near the top of </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies,</v>

396
00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:43.470
<v Speaker 1>you tend to expand so that you look </v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger than than you could if you shrunk</v>

397
00:19:43.471 --> 00:19:45.450
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're low dominant person,</v>

398
00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:49.770
<v Speaker 1>you wander around like this so that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>look small and weak and you don't pose a</v>

399
00:19:49.771 --> 00:19:51.390
<v Speaker 1>threat to anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're at the top,</v>

400
00:19:51.391 --> 00:19:54.240
<v Speaker 1>you expand yourself so that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>command the space.</v>

401
00:19:54.241 --> 00:19:57.300
<v Speaker 1>And that's why he has that particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of regal posture.</v>

402
00:19:57.301 --> 00:19:59.010
<v Speaker 1>And if you look at his facial </v>
<v Speaker 1>expression,</v>

403
00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:01.860
<v Speaker 1>you see that it's quite severe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He like he's,</v>

404
00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:05.040
<v Speaker 1>he's capable of kindness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's also harsh and judgmental.</v>

405
00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:07.830
<v Speaker 1>And that's what society is like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what the superego is like.</v>

406
00:20:07.831 --> 00:20:10.290
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is that he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>integrated his aggression.</v>

407
00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:11.333
<v Speaker 1>And I've seen this happen in my clinical</v>
<v Speaker 1>clients when they come in and they're </v>

408
00:20:13.891 --> 00:20:14.724
<v Speaker 1>too agreeable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they look like Simba looks later in the </v>

409
00:20:17.221 --> 00:20:20.940
<v Speaker 1>movie when he's an adolescent and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of like a deer in headlights.</v>

410
00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:23.190
<v Speaker 1>Everything is coming in and nothing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming out.</v>

411
00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:24.413
<v Speaker 1>But when the person integrates their </v>
<v Speaker 1>shadow and gets the aggressive part of </v>

412
00:20:27.301 --> 00:20:28.950
<v Speaker 1>themselves integrated into their </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality,</v>

413
00:20:28.951 --> 00:20:31.290
<v Speaker 1>their faces hardened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you look at people,</v>

414
00:20:31.291 --> 00:20:33.840
<v Speaker 1>you can tell because the people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>too agreeable,</v>

415
00:20:33.841 --> 00:20:36.330
<v Speaker 1>look childlike and innocent and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who will,</v>

416
00:20:36.331 --> 00:20:39.900
<v Speaker 1>a hyper aggressive person will look mean</v>
<v Speaker 1>and cruel.</v>

417
00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:43.410
<v Speaker 1>But</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see if that's good.</v>

418
00:20:43.411 --> 00:20:44.970
<v Speaker 1>That's still working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

419
00:20:44.971 --> 00:20:47.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've seen people's face changes,</v>

420
00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:50.530
<v Speaker 1>change face change in the course of </v>
<v Speaker 1>therapy,</v>

421
00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:52.510
<v Speaker 1>men and women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

422
00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:56.320
<v Speaker 1>and what happens is they start to look </v>
<v Speaker 1>more mature and it's more like they're,</v>

423
00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:59.800
<v Speaker 1>they're judging the world as well as </v>
<v Speaker 1>interacting with it properly.</v>

424
00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:02.720
<v Speaker 1>Once they integrate that more </v>
<v Speaker 1>disagreeable part of it,</v>

425
00:21:02.721 --> 00:21:04.030
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very necessary.</v>

426
00:21:04.031 --> 00:21:08.140
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of the incorporation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the union shadow or the incorporation of</v>

427
00:21:08.141 --> 00:21:10.090
<v Speaker 1>the unconscious from a Freudian </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>

428
00:21:10.091 --> 00:21:13.420
<v Speaker 1>but old Musap Musafa there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's already got that,</v>

429
00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:16.210
<v Speaker 1>he's already got that covered.</v>

430
00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:18.190
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's capable.</v>

431
00:21:18.191 --> 00:21:19.024
<v Speaker 1>Like obviously he can smile and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>fully capable of the full range of </v>

432
00:21:21.971 --> 00:21:23.890
<v Speaker 1>expressions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's a tough looking character.</v>

433
00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:29.170
<v Speaker 1>And now this they'll baboon here who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be basically just a fool.</v>

434
00:21:29.171 --> 00:21:30.004
<v Speaker 1>When the story was first written,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he turned into what's essentially a </v>

435
00:21:31.961 --> 00:21:32.794
<v Speaker 1>sharman across time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he represents the self from the </v>

436
00:21:36.341 --> 00:21:37.174
<v Speaker 1>union perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the self is everything you could be </v>

437
00:21:39.371 --> 00:21:40.204
<v Speaker 1>across time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you imagine that there's you and </v>

438
00:21:42.161 --> 00:21:44.830
<v Speaker 1>there's the potential inside you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that is,</v>

439
00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:45.693
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and potential is an interesting idea </v>

440
00:21:47.231 --> 00:21:51.640
<v Speaker 1>because it's represents something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't yet real yet we act like it's real</v>

441
00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:54.400
<v Speaker 1>because people will say to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should live up to your potential.</v>

442
00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:55.653
<v Speaker 1>And that potential is partly what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could be if you interacted with the </v>

443
00:21:58.751 --> 00:22:02.200
<v Speaker 1>world in a manner that would gain you </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most information,</v>

444
00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:02.920
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

445
00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:06.050
<v Speaker 1>Because you build yourself out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>information in the [inaudible] sense.</v>

446
00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:07.143
<v Speaker 1>But it's deeper than that too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we know that if you take </v>

447
00:22:09.041 --> 00:22:11.080
<v Speaker 1>yourself and you put yourself in a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment,</v>

448
00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:13.510
<v Speaker 1>new genes turn on in your nervous </v>
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>

449
00:22:13.511 --> 00:22:14.344
<v Speaker 1>they encode for new proteins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you're full of biological </v>

450
00:22:17.441 --> 00:22:18.274
<v Speaker 1>potential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That won't be realized unless you move </v>

451
00:22:19.961 --> 00:22:23.890
<v Speaker 1>yourself around in the world into </v>
<v Speaker 1>different challenging circumstances.</v>

452
00:22:23.891 --> 00:22:24.724
<v Speaker 1>And that'll turn on different circuits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not merely that you're </v>

453
00:22:27.041 --> 00:22:27.874
<v Speaker 1>incorporating information from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside world in the constructivist </v>

454
00:22:30.131 --> 00:22:30.964
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that by exposing yourself to </v>

455
00:22:32.591 --> 00:22:33.424
<v Speaker 1>different environments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put different physiological demands </v>

456
00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:37.000
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on yourself,</v>

457
00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:41.980
<v Speaker 1>all the way down to the genetic level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that manifests new elements of you.</v>

458
00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:44.290
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that happens to</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

459
00:22:44.291 --> 00:22:46.810
<v Speaker 1>and this is a very common cultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>notion,</v>

460
00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:47.823
<v Speaker 1>is that you should go on a pilgrimage at</v>
<v Speaker 1>some point to somewhere central in that </v>

461
00:22:51.281 --> 00:22:52.114
<v Speaker 1>would be say like the Rock and the pride</v>
<v Speaker 1>rock and the lion king because you take </v>

462
00:22:55.511 --> 00:22:56.344
<v Speaker 1>yourself out of your dopey little </v>
<v Speaker 1>village and that's just the little </v>

463
00:22:58.421 --> 00:23:01.540
<v Speaker 1>bounded you that everyone knows and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't very expanded.</v>

464
00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:05.140
<v Speaker 1>And then you go somewhere dark and </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous to the central place.</v>

465
00:23:05.141 --> 00:23:08.020
<v Speaker 1>And while you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have adventures and they toughen you</v>

466
00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:09.063
<v Speaker 1>and pull more out of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like partly because you're becoming </v>

467
00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:14.920
<v Speaker 1>informed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means information,</v>

468
00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:18.220
<v Speaker 1>it means you're becoming more organized </v>
<v Speaker 1>at every level of analysis.</v>

469
00:23:18.221 --> 00:23:21.910
<v Speaker 1>But there's also more of you too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a very classic idea.</v>

470
00:23:21.911 --> 00:23:25.000
<v Speaker 1>And then in cathedrals in Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially at charter,</v>

471
00:23:25.001 --> 00:23:27.430
<v Speaker 1>there's a big maze on the floor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a circular maize,</v>

472
00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:28.533
<v Speaker 1>which is a symbolic representation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the pilgrimage for people who couldn't </v>

473
00:23:31.301 --> 00:23:32.134
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a huge circle divided into </v>

474
00:23:33.971 --> 00:23:35.980
<v Speaker 1>quadrants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a union Mandela.</v>

475
00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:40.120
<v Speaker 1>And you enter the maize at one point and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have to walk through the entire</v>

476
00:23:40.121 --> 00:23:41.470
<v Speaker 1>maze north,</v>
<v Speaker 1>east,</v>

477
00:23:41.471 --> 00:23:44.320
<v Speaker 1>west,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and south before you get to the center.</v>

478
00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:48.020
<v Speaker 1>And the center is symbolized by a flower</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's carved in stone.</v>

479
00:23:48.021 --> 00:23:49.340
<v Speaker 1>It looks like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's big.</v>

480
00:23:49.341 --> 00:23:49.971
<v Speaker 1>This means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

481
00:23:49.971 --> 00:23:50.331
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

482
00:23:50.331 --> 00:23:51.164
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's large so that you can walk it and </v>

483
00:23:52.941 --> 00:23:55.490
<v Speaker 1>that's a symbolic pilgrimage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes you to the center.</v>

484
00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:58.460
<v Speaker 1>That's the center of the Cross because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it tended cathedral.</v>

485
00:23:58.461 --> 00:24:01.850
<v Speaker 1>And that's the point of acceptance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of voluntary suffering.</v>

486
00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:04.910
<v Speaker 1>That's what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you walk through,</v>

487
00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:05.893
<v Speaker 1>you can call that a circum ambulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go to all the quarters of the world </v>

488
00:24:08.991 --> 00:24:11.300
<v Speaker 1>to find yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>

489
00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:14.990
<v Speaker 1>well the self is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the baboon in this particular,</v>

490
00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:17.750
<v Speaker 1>in this pr,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's a mandrill actually in this</v>

491
00:24:17.751 --> 00:24:20.240
<v Speaker 1>particular representation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he lives in the tree.</v>

492
00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:22.130
<v Speaker 1>He lives in the tree of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a bale,</v>

493
00:24:22.131 --> 00:24:23.510
<v Speaker 1>Bab tree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this particular,</v>

494
00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:24.463
<v Speaker 1>so he's the spirit that inhabits the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tree of life and he's the eternal wise </v>

495
00:24:28.671 --> 00:24:29.870
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a way of thinking.</v>

496
00:24:29.871 --> 00:24:31.550
<v Speaker 1>So is the king,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's,</v>

497
00:24:31.551 --> 00:24:35.090
<v Speaker 1>he's sort of a superordinate king or an </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside king in some sense.</v>

498
00:24:35.091 --> 00:24:39.320
<v Speaker 1>He's the repository of ancient wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the king is the manner in which that</v>

499
00:24:39.321 --> 00:24:41.420
<v Speaker 1>wisdom is currently being acted out in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

500
00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:44.150
<v Speaker 1>And so their friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that means that the king,</v>

501
00:24:44.151 --> 00:24:47.360
<v Speaker 1>he's a good king because if they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the king was a bad king,</v>

502
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:48.343
<v Speaker 1>he would be alienated from himself and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would make him shallow and one </v>

503
00:24:51.771 --> 00:24:53.900
<v Speaker 1>dimensional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that would make him a bad ruler.</v>

504
00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:56.210
<v Speaker 1>No union with the traditions of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>past.</v>

505
00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:57.253
<v Speaker 1>To be a good ruler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to rescue your father from the </v>

506
00:24:59.511 --> 00:25:00.344
<v Speaker 1>underworld and integrate that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course that's a main theme in </v>

507
00:25:03.171 --> 00:25:05.210
<v Speaker 1>this entire movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

508
00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:12.090
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a new mystery to solve.</v>

509
00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:38.340
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the hero was born and that's what the</v>

510
00:25:38.341 --> 00:25:40.140
<v Speaker 1>rising sun represents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everybody goes,</v>

511
00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:41.160
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't that cute?</v>

512
00:25:41.161 --> 00:25:44.490
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're biologically wired,</v>

513
00:25:44.491 --> 00:25:48.270
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're agreeable to </v>
<v Speaker 1>respond with caretaking activity to cute</v>

514
00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:51.240
<v Speaker 1>to cuteness and cuteness is button,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nose,</v>

515
00:25:51.241 --> 00:25:52.680
<v Speaker 1>big eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>small mouth,</v>

516
00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:55.950
<v Speaker 1>roundhead symmetry and helpless </v>
<v Speaker 1>movements.</v>

517
00:25:55.951 --> 00:25:59.070
<v Speaker 1>And you'll respond to that across the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire class of Mammalian,</v>

518
00:25:59.290 --> 00:26:01.860
<v Speaker 1>of Mammalian creatures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even maybe down to lizards.</v>

519
00:26:01.861 --> 00:26:03.150
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't that cute?</v>

520
00:26:03.151 --> 00:26:04.170
<v Speaker 1>It's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a lizard.</v>

521
00:26:04.171 --> 00:26:06.590
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

522
00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:08.460
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's an archetype as well.</v>

523
00:26:08.461 --> 00:26:11.730
<v Speaker 1>That's the archetype of the vulnerable </v>
<v Speaker 1>hero at bore,</v>

524
00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:14.010
<v Speaker 1>the vulnerable hero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>newly born.</v>

525
00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:15.143
<v Speaker 1>And that should invoke a desire mostly </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the part of males to encourage and </v>

526
00:26:19.561 --> 00:26:22.290
<v Speaker 1>mostly on the part of females to neuro </v>
<v Speaker 1>to nurture.</v>

527
00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:26.160
<v Speaker 1>But males and females are quite cross </v>
<v Speaker 1>wired among human beings.</v>

528
00:26:26.161 --> 00:26:28.380
<v Speaker 1>And so there's encouragement from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>

529
00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:30.450
<v Speaker 1>And there's also near nurturing from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

530
00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:33.780
<v Speaker 1>And of course those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those curves in some sense overlap.</v>

531
00:26:33.781 --> 00:26:36.900
<v Speaker 1>So there's more nurturing males and more</v>
<v Speaker 1>encouraging females.</v>

532
00:26:36.901 --> 00:26:37.734
<v Speaker 1>But that's roughly the archetype.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he looks cute and everybody goes </v>

533
00:26:40.471 --> 00:26:41.304
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's because the animators nailed </v>

534
00:26:42.511 --> 00:26:43.170
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

535
00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:46.620
<v Speaker 1>the essential features of cuteness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's also in the light,</v>

536
00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:47.483
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then the Sharman mandrill </v>

537
00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:54.180
<v Speaker 1>basically baptizes him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's essentially what he's doing.</v>

538
00:26:54.181 --> 00:26:56.460
<v Speaker 1>And he uses something that's symbolic of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sun,</v>

539
00:26:56.610 --> 00:26:57.443
<v Speaker 1>which is this ripe fruit and fruits are </v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolic of the sun because of course </v>

540
00:27:00.391 --> 00:27:02.790
<v Speaker 1>they need the sun to ripen and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>round like the sun.</v>

541
00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:05.460
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people know that they need light.</v>

542
00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:07.320
<v Speaker 1>But and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so anyways,</v>

543
00:27:07.321 --> 00:27:08.154
<v Speaker 1>the animators make a relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the fruit that the Shaman is </v>

544
00:27:11.971 --> 00:27:15.720
<v Speaker 1>going to break and the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he's also being baptized into the</v>

545
00:27:15.721 --> 00:27:16.554
<v Speaker 1>sun and that means that he's being </v>
<v Speaker 1>baptized into the light or that he's </v>

546
00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:20.820
<v Speaker 1>being transformed into a hero.</v>

547
00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:23.940
<v Speaker 1>And so then everyone's happy and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically,</v>

548
00:27:23.941 --> 00:27:24.774
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the divine father in the divine mother </v>

549
00:27:26.071 --> 00:27:28.980
<v Speaker 1>and the divine son and the self who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking care of that.</v>

550
00:27:28.981 --> 00:27:33.810
<v Speaker 1>And there's a union between the baby and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wise old man because the baby is all</v>

551
00:27:33.811 --> 00:27:37.350
<v Speaker 1>the potential that's realized in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>self.</v>

552
00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:38.483
<v Speaker 1>And there's an old idea that the way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>full maturity is to find what you lost </v>

553
00:27:43.051 --> 00:27:46.170
<v Speaker 1>as a child had regain it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a brilliant idea.</v>

554
00:27:46.171 --> 00:27:46.790
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

555
00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:48.720
<v Speaker 1>that echoes through miss all over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

556
00:27:48.721 --> 00:27:52.740
<v Speaker 1>And that means you have to regain your </v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity once you're disciplined and you</v>

557
00:27:52.741 --> 00:27:53.574
<v Speaker 1>know how to do something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to regain your capacity for </v>

558
00:27:55.261 --> 00:27:56.094
<v Speaker 1>play and sort of for wide eyed wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's maybe the child like part of </v>

559
00:27:59.641 --> 00:28:02.570
<v Speaker 1>your spirit and the reintegration of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that child,</v>

560
00:28:02.571 --> 00:28:07.571
<v Speaker 1>like part with the adult grownup part </v>
<v Speaker 1>revivified as the adult grownup part and</v>

561
00:28:08.041 --> 00:28:11.520
<v Speaker 1>allows the child to manifest itself in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>disciplined way in the world.</v>

562
00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:13.530
<v Speaker 1>And so that's all being hinted that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

563
00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:17.910
<v Speaker 1>And then they show the Sharman shows the</v>
<v Speaker 1>baby,</v>

564
00:28:17.911 --> 00:28:18.744
<v Speaker 1>the newborn hero to the crowded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very cool what happens in the </v>

565
00:28:21.391 --> 00:28:23.490
<v Speaker 1>movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the animals spontaneously,</v>

566
00:28:23.491 --> 00:28:24.324
<v Speaker 1>Neil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I can give you an example of that </v>

567
00:28:25.711 --> 00:28:29.190
<v Speaker 1>kind of spontaneous action in a crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine you're watching a</v>

568
00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:33.330
<v Speaker 1>gymnastics performance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

569
00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:34.333
<v Speaker 1>And it's like at a high level world </v>
<v Speaker 1>class performance and someone comes out </v>

570
00:28:36.811 --> 00:28:40.350
<v Speaker 1>there and they do this routine that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>just dead letter perfect.</v>

571
00:28:40.351 --> 00:28:41.184
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they stop and everybody claps like </v>

572
00:28:43.051 --> 00:28:43.884
<v Speaker 1>mad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

573
00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:44.753
<v Speaker 1>And it's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then the next contestant comes </v>

574
00:28:46.951 --> 00:28:48.990
<v Speaker 1>out and they're basically in real </v>
<v Speaker 1>trouble because you know,</v>

575
00:28:48.991 --> 00:28:52.710
<v Speaker 1>this person just got 9.7 out of 10 and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was perfect.</v>

576
00:28:52.711 --> 00:28:55.860
<v Speaker 1>So how do you beat perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so will they come out there and then</v>

577
00:28:55.861 --> 00:28:56.694
<v Speaker 1>you watch them and you're right on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>edge of your seat because what you see </v>

578
00:28:58.651 --> 00:29:03.210
<v Speaker 1>them do is something extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>disciplined just like the last person to</v>

579
00:29:03.211 --> 00:29:03.600
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>

580
00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:04.433
<v Speaker 1>But they push themselves into that zone </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just beyond their discipline </v>

581
00:29:07.291 --> 00:29:08.124
<v Speaker 1>capacity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can tell every second you're </v>

582
00:29:09.601 --> 00:29:12.150
<v Speaker 1>watching it that they're that close to </v>
<v Speaker 1>disaster.</v>

583
00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:14.540
<v Speaker 1>And so you're right on the edge of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>seat and,</v>

584
00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:17.400
<v Speaker 1>and you know that they're doing a high </v>
<v Speaker 1>wire act without a net.</v>

585
00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:19.950
<v Speaker 1>And so when they finally land </v>
<v Speaker 1>triumphantly,</v>

586
00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:22.200
<v Speaker 1>you'll all stand up and clap </v>
<v Speaker 1>spontaneously.</v>

587
00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:23.273
<v Speaker 1>And it's because you've just witnessed </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who's a master at playing a </v>

588
00:29:25.711 --> 00:29:26.544
<v Speaker 1>game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's also a master at improving how to </v>

589
00:29:28.681 --> 00:29:29.514
<v Speaker 1>play that game at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people love that more than anything </v>

590
00:29:32.131 --> 00:29:32.964
<v Speaker 1>to see that it's just absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming cause it's a testament to </v>

591
00:29:35.581 --> 00:29:39.810
<v Speaker 1>the human spirit and you'll respond </v>
<v Speaker 1>automatically and unconsciously to that.</v>

592
00:29:39.811 --> 00:29:40.644
<v Speaker 1>And that's why that's an analogy to why </v>
<v Speaker 1>the animals all spontaneously bow when </v>

593
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:46.833
<v Speaker 1>now what happens is they sh he shows the</v>
<v Speaker 1>lion king and the sun breaks and shines </v>

594
00:29:50.981 --> 00:29:52.990
<v Speaker 1>on that the hero at the same time.</v>

595
00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:54.033
<v Speaker 1>So there's this concordance between an </v>
<v Speaker 1>earthly event and as so called heavenly </v>

596
00:29:57.161 --> 00:29:59.380
<v Speaker 1>event and human would call that </v>
<v Speaker 1>synchronous.</v>

597
00:29:59.590 --> 00:30:04.540
<v Speaker 1>That's his idea of synchronicity where </v>
<v Speaker 1>something important subjectively is also</v>

598
00:30:04.541 --> 00:30:05.374
<v Speaker 1>signified by something that appears in </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative keeping with that in the </v>

599
00:30:08.531 --> 00:30:09.364
<v Speaker 1>outside world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's one of the most controversial </v>

600
00:30:11.081 --> 00:30:11.914
<v Speaker 1>elements of his theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've experienced a variety of </v>

601
00:30:14.261 --> 00:30:16.810
<v Speaker 1>synchronous events and they often happen</v>
<v Speaker 1>in therapy,</v>

602
00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:17.973
<v Speaker 1>especially around dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're very hard to communicate </v>

603
00:30:20.351 --> 00:30:23.980
<v Speaker 1>because they're so specific to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>context in which it occurs.</v>

604
00:30:23.981 --> 00:30:26.620
<v Speaker 1>They're very difficult to explain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

605
00:30:27.010 --> 00:30:30.610
<v Speaker 1>it's the syncronous event that make </v>
<v Speaker 1>drops all the animals to their knees.</v>

606
00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:31.593
<v Speaker 1>So there's the sun coming out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's shining on them and all the </v>

607
00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:35.463
<v Speaker 1>primates go mad for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's of course exactly what we do </v>

608
00:30:37.811 --> 00:30:41.500
<v Speaker 1>when we applaud and then we switched to </v>
<v Speaker 1>scar.</v>

609
00:30:41.530 --> 00:30:45.580
<v Speaker 1>Now scar is Mufasa's brother evil </v>
<v Speaker 1>brother.</v>

610
00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:48.460
<v Speaker 1>The king always has an evil brother and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so does the hero.</v>

611
00:30:48.461 --> 00:30:49.294
<v Speaker 1>The hero always has an adversary and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>reason for that is the king always has </v>

612
00:30:52.301 --> 00:30:55.900
<v Speaker 1>an evil brother and that means that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>state always has it.</v>

613
00:30:55.901 --> 00:30:56.734
<v Speaker 1>Tyrannical element.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the tyrannical element exists for </v>

614
00:30:58.991 --> 00:31:03.670
<v Speaker 1>two reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is the state deteriorates of its own</v>

615
00:31:03.671 --> 00:31:06.670
<v Speaker 1>accord and that's an entropy </v>
<v Speaker 1>observation.</v>

616
00:31:06.671 --> 00:31:09.940
<v Speaker 1>What that means is that the state is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>construction of the past,</v>

617
00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:10.953
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the present isn't the same as the </v>

618
00:31:12.731 --> 00:31:13.564
<v Speaker 1>past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to the degree that the past is </v>

619
00:31:15.701 --> 00:31:17.770
<v Speaker 1>mismatched with the demands of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>present,</v>

620
00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:19.060
<v Speaker 1>then it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's,</v>

621
00:31:19.090 --> 00:31:21.880
<v Speaker 1>then it's a tyrannical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's malfunctioning.</v>

622
00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:25.090
<v Speaker 1>And so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a continual problem with the state.</v>

623
00:31:25.091 --> 00:31:27.940
<v Speaker 1>It's always two steps behind the </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>

624
00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:32.410
<v Speaker 1>And so then that means that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>awareness of living people has to update</v>

625
00:31:32.411 --> 00:31:34.630
<v Speaker 1>the state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so elliot and Murcia,</v>

626
00:31:34.631 --> 00:31:36.640
<v Speaker 1>Eliana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a great historian of religions,</v>

627
00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:37.713
<v Speaker 1>looked at flood stories from all over </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world because there are flood </v>

628
00:31:39.761 --> 00:31:42.640
<v Speaker 1>stories from all over the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because there are floods all over</v>

629
00:31:42.641 --> 00:31:43.390
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

630
00:31:43.390 --> 00:31:45.640
<v Speaker 1>But that there's a psychological reason </v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

631
00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:49.420
<v Speaker 1>So you imagine that New Orleans was </v>
<v Speaker 1>wiped out by a hurricane,</v>

632
00:31:49.421 --> 00:31:50.110
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A flood,</v>

633
00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:50.681
<v Speaker 1>and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

634
00:31:50.681 --> 00:31:52.540
<v Speaker 1>that was an act of God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you think,</v>

635
00:31:52.541 --> 00:31:54.040
<v Speaker 1>wait a second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a second.</v>

636
00:31:54.970 --> 00:31:57.010
<v Speaker 1>They knew those damn dikes weren't going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to hold.</v>

637
00:31:57.011 --> 00:31:58.810
<v Speaker 1>They knew they weren't built strong </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>

638
00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:02.170
<v Speaker 1>They took the money that was allocated </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the dikes and spent it badly.</v>

639
00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:06.310
<v Speaker 1>And that was willful blindness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you could say that it was God who</v>

640
00:32:06.311 --> 00:32:08.020
<v Speaker 1>caused the flood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

641
00:32:08.021 --> 00:32:08.854
<v Speaker 1>metaphorically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you could also say that it was the </v>

642
00:32:10.211 --> 00:32:11.044
<v Speaker 1>degeneration of the state and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>willful blindness of the politicians </v>

643
00:32:15.311 --> 00:32:16.144
<v Speaker 1>that caused the flood in Holland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They build the dikes to withstand the </v>

644
00:32:18.911 --> 00:32:22.660
<v Speaker 1>worst storm in 10,000 years in the use </v>
<v Speaker 1>other than us.</v>

645
00:32:22.661 --> 00:32:25.480
<v Speaker 1>They built them to withstand the worst </v>
<v Speaker 1>storm in a hundred years.</v>

646
00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:27.460
<v Speaker 1>And they knew that that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>insufficient.</v>

647
00:32:27.910 --> 00:32:30.130
<v Speaker 1>And so the flood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's a flood,</v>

648
00:32:30.131 --> 00:32:31.000
<v Speaker 1>while you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

649
00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:32.980
<v Speaker 1>that's an act of nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can also say,</v>

650
00:32:32.981 --> 00:32:35.320
<v Speaker 1>just wait a sec.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe if there was a flood,</v>

651
00:32:35.321 --> 00:32:39.290
<v Speaker 1>because we looked the other way and </v>
<v Speaker 1>because our systems are out of date,</v>

652
00:32:39.530 --> 00:32:43.250
<v Speaker 1>and that's why in flood stories there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a continual theme,</v>

653
00:32:43.251 --> 00:32:44.084
<v Speaker 1>which is the people get wiped out by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>flood because God judges them harshly </v>

654
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:52.880
<v Speaker 1>for their senility and they're willful </v>
<v Speaker 1>blindness.</v>

655
00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:56.660
<v Speaker 1>And it's a story that's very much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll have a flood in your life,</v>

656
00:32:57.380 --> 00:32:58.213
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll be a flood of chaos and you will </v>

657
00:32:59.481 --> 00:33:03.050
<v Speaker 1>find a of one form or another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you'll find when you investigate the</v>

658
00:33:03.051 --> 00:33:05.660
<v Speaker 1>causes of the flood that some of it will</v>
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

659
00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:08.300
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes this is the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just random.</v>

660
00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:09.163
<v Speaker 1>You just got singled out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got a terrible disease and that's </v>

661
00:33:11.721 --> 00:33:13.190
<v Speaker 1>the end of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or something like that.</v>

662
00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:16.430
<v Speaker 1>But there'll be other situations where </v>
<v Speaker 1>the flood comes and you're surrounded by</v>

663
00:33:16.431 --> 00:33:18.080
<v Speaker 1>chaos and you'll look into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll think,</v>

664
00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:21.860
<v Speaker 1>I knew this was coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew I wasn't paying attention.</v>

665
00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:22.873
<v Speaker 1>I knew I hadn't sorted things out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the consequences of that will have </v>

666
00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:27.163
<v Speaker 1>cascaded and wiped you out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you're in real trouble because </v>

667
00:33:29.631 --> 00:33:32.480
<v Speaker 1>not only did you get wiped out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you also know it's your fault.</v>

668
00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:33.523
<v Speaker 1>And that is not a good thing that makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>you bitter and resentful and murderous </v>

669
00:33:37.041 --> 00:33:38.690
<v Speaker 1>would not happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

670
00:33:38.691 --> 00:33:40.910
<v Speaker 1>scar is scarred,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

671
00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:42.013
<v Speaker 1>So what that implies is he's had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty rough life and he's kind of </v>

672
00:33:44.121 --> 00:33:47.120
<v Speaker 1>skinny and he said he was born in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>low end of the gene pool.</v>

673
00:33:47.121 --> 00:33:47.954
<v Speaker 1>And so he has reasons to be resentful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's also hyper intelligent and </v>

674
00:33:51.021 --> 00:33:51.854
<v Speaker 1>rational.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's one of the things you see very </v>

675
00:33:53.421 --> 00:33:58.070
<v Speaker 1>commonly about the evil adversary of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>state or of the individuals,</v>

676
00:33:58.190 --> 00:34:00.320
<v Speaker 1>often intelligent and hyper rational.</v>

677
00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:01.423
<v Speaker 1>And the best commentator on that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably John Milton in paradise lost </v>

678
00:34:05.301 --> 00:34:08.420
<v Speaker 1>because that's how he represents Lucifer</v>
<v Speaker 1>or Satan,</v>

679
00:34:08.450 --> 00:34:11.090
<v Speaker 1>who's the spirit of rationality and </v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment.</v>

680
00:34:11.091 --> 00:34:12.770
<v Speaker 1>Strangely enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hence Lucifer,</v>

681
00:34:12.771 --> 00:34:15.320
<v Speaker 1>the bringer of light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that,</v>

682
00:34:15.321 --> 00:34:16.154
<v Speaker 1>as far as I can tell them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is something that Milton figured </v>

683
00:34:17.721 --> 00:34:18.554
<v Speaker 1>out when he compiled all these ancient </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories about evil and tried to make </v>

684
00:34:21.501 --> 00:34:22.334
<v Speaker 1>them coherent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that the problem with irrationality </v>

685
00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:29.660
<v Speaker 1>with rationality is that it tends to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fall in love with its own productions,</v>

686
00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:30.883
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then it comes up with a theory </v>

687
00:34:31.761 --> 00:34:34.730
<v Speaker 1>and it makes that a totality and then it</v>
<v Speaker 1>won't let go.</v>

688
00:34:34.731 --> 00:34:35.564
<v Speaker 1>So the rational mind has a totalitarian </v>
<v Speaker 1>element and we know that to some degree </v>

689
00:34:38.901 --> 00:34:39.734
<v Speaker 1>because that kind of rationality seems </v>
<v Speaker 1>more left hemisphere focused and the </v>

690
00:34:43.371 --> 00:34:44.204
<v Speaker 1>left hemisphere tends to impose </v>
<v Speaker 1>structured order on the world and be </v>

691
00:34:47.601 --> 00:34:49.370
<v Speaker 1>updated by the right hemisphere.</v>

692
00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:52.700
<v Speaker 1>And the right hemisphere generally </v>
<v Speaker 1>updates it with negative information and</v>

693
00:34:52.701 --> 00:34:55.850
<v Speaker 1>with fantasy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the left hemisphere will impose a</v>

694
00:34:55.851 --> 00:34:56.684
<v Speaker 1>coherent structure on the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really necessary for you to </v>

695
00:34:59.031 --> 00:34:59.864
<v Speaker 1>live in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is there's a tension </v>

696
00:35:01.521 --> 00:35:02.354
<v Speaker 1>between coherence and completeness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly why you need two </v>

697
00:35:05.181 --> 00:35:06.014
<v Speaker 1>hemispheres.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need one to represent the world and </v>

698
00:35:07.671 --> 00:35:12.020
<v Speaker 1>you need one to keep track of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>exceptions and to feed those slowly into</v>

699
00:35:12.021 --> 00:35:12.854
<v Speaker 1>the representational system so that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>so that it can stay updated without </v>

700
00:35:16.191 --> 00:35:19.520
<v Speaker 1>collapsing into complete chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

701
00:35:19.610 --> 00:35:20.443
<v Speaker 1>scar and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got this like droopy mouth in this </v>

702
00:35:23.241 --> 00:35:26.300
<v Speaker 1>whiny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>arrogant voice and he feels hard done by</v>

703
00:35:26.301 --> 00:35:28.270
<v Speaker 1>and he's resentful and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in,</v>

704
00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:31.670
<v Speaker 1>in classic hero stories are stories of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the state as well.</v>

705
00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:34.430
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is an Egyptian take on it.</v>

706
00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:35.380
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cyrus was,</v>

707
00:35:35.410 --> 00:35:38.920
<v Speaker 1>was the god of the state and who later </v>
<v Speaker 1>became Satan,</v>

708
00:35:38.921 --> 00:35:40.500
<v Speaker 1>that name became Satan.</v>

709
00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:42.660
<v Speaker 1>Has It transformed through Coptic </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity?</v>

710
00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:46.830
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cyrus had a brother named set and set.</v>

711
00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:49.980
<v Speaker 1>He didn't pay attention to set enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>

712
00:35:50.210 --> 00:35:53.340
<v Speaker 1>Instead was always scheming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scheming to overthrow the kingdom,</v>

713
00:35:53.341 --> 00:35:57.960
<v Speaker 1>just like scar is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Egyptians said straightforwardly</v>

714
00:35:57.961 --> 00:36:00.750
<v Speaker 1>that the reason that oh cyrus got </v>
<v Speaker 1>overthrown by sad,</v>

715
00:36:00.751 --> 00:36:01.584
<v Speaker 1>he got chopped into pieces and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>pieces distributed throughout the state </v>

716
00:36:04.081 --> 00:36:04.914
<v Speaker 1>in the mythological representation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those pieces were actually the </v>

717
00:36:07.741 --> 00:36:10.470
<v Speaker 1>provinces of Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>technically speaking.</v>

718
00:36:10.471 --> 00:36:10.880
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

719
00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:13.200
<v Speaker 1>and that's what the Egyptians thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's quite cool.</v>

720
00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:18.000
<v Speaker 1>But the Egyptian said explicitly that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason that ocirus got overthrown by</v>

721
00:36:18.001 --> 00:36:20.670
<v Speaker 1>set was because he was willfully blind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>old,</v>

722
00:36:20.671 --> 00:36:22.230
<v Speaker 1>senile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and willfully blind.</v>

723
00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:23.213
<v Speaker 1>Same idea as the flood myth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't see that quite here because </v>

724
00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:31.220
<v Speaker 1>Mufasa is sort of on to set or to scar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but scar is more treacherous than Mo.</v>

725
00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:32.303
<v Speaker 1>Fasa believes and he gets that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gets at who Fossa by going through </v>

726
00:36:35.461 --> 00:36:36.294
<v Speaker 1>his son.</v>

727
00:36:36.450 --> 00:36:38.370
<v Speaker 1>Bye Bye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By playing on the,</v>

728
00:36:38.371 --> 00:36:42.180
<v Speaker 1>on the impulsivity and juvenile </v>
<v Speaker 1>qualities of his son.</v>

729
00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:43.373
<v Speaker 1>And so obviously there's some antagonism</v>
<v Speaker 1>between these two as you can see by </v>

730
00:36:46.741 --> 00:36:51.120
<v Speaker 1>their facial expressions there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's the good example of scar.</v>

731
00:36:51.121 --> 00:36:51.954
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got that droopy kind of whiny </v>

732
00:36:53.370 --> 00:36:54.203
<v Speaker 1>malevolent face and that malevolent </v>
<v Speaker 1>voice that Jeremy Irons pulls it off so </v>

733
00:36:57.211 --> 00:36:59.880
<v Speaker 1>incredibly well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's,</v>

734
00:36:59.881 --> 00:37:02.250
<v Speaker 1>he's always skulking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a creature of the night.</v>

735
00:37:02.251 --> 00:37:03.084
<v Speaker 1>He always skulks around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not a creature of the day in any </v>

736
00:37:05.401 --> 00:37:07.200
<v Speaker 1>sense of the word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

737
00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:08.543
<v Speaker 1>obviously Mufasa is golden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the sun and scars dark like the </v>

738
00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:13.590
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another thing,</v>

739
00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:14.970
<v Speaker 1>another clue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another hint.</v>

740
00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:16.920
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the tree.</v>

741
00:37:16.921 --> 00:37:19.170
<v Speaker 1>That's the tree of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We already talked about that.</v>

742
00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:20.213
<v Speaker 1>I think that represents the multiple </v>
<v Speaker 1>levels at which you exist </v>

743
00:37:22.831 --> 00:37:25.350
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the way from the Subatomic,</v>

744
00:37:25.351 --> 00:37:27.390
<v Speaker 1>all the way up to the cosmic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

745
00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:29.160
<v Speaker 1>And that's a different kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimension.</v>

746
00:37:29.370 --> 00:37:30.203
<v Speaker 1>And that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the place that the self inhabits </v>

747
00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:34.530
<v Speaker 1>and it can kind of move up and down </v>
<v Speaker 1>those dimensions.</v>

748
00:37:34.890 --> 00:37:38.600
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the Sharman lives inside that tree.</v>

749
00:37:38.601 --> 00:37:42.390
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was our first introduction to him,</v>

750
00:37:42.391 --> 00:37:44.910
<v Speaker 1>basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's the spirit of the ancient tree.</v>

751
00:37:44.911 --> 00:37:46.710
<v Speaker 1>That's another way of thinking about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

752
00:37:46.711 --> 00:37:48.960
<v Speaker 1>very common element in stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

753
00:37:48.961 --> 00:37:51.390
<v Speaker 1>The spirit of the ancient tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

754
00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:52.650
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now,</v>

755
00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:54.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mufasa has taken,</v>

756
00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:57.450
<v Speaker 1>taken Simba up to the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pyramid,</v>

757
00:37:57.451 --> 00:37:58.370
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the,</v>

758
00:37:58.620 --> 00:37:59.970
<v Speaker 1>the aluminum place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

759
00:37:59.971 --> 00:38:00.804
<v Speaker 1>or the place of the eye where you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>really see a long ways and he's </v>

760
00:38:03.811 --> 00:38:06.240
<v Speaker 1>explaining to him what his kingdom is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be.</v>

761
00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:09.420
<v Speaker 1>And you see the sun of course appears at</v>
<v Speaker 1>that to begin with.</v>

762
00:38:09.421 --> 00:38:11.490
<v Speaker 1>And that's another hint about being at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the top.</v>

763
00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:13.830
<v Speaker 1>That's the illuminated part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pyramid.</v>

764
00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:14.993
<v Speaker 1>And so they're up there talking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what Mufasa tells Simba is that his </v>

765
00:38:18.151 --> 00:38:20.940
<v Speaker 1>kingdom is every place the light has </v>
<v Speaker 1>touched.</v>

766
00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:22.133
<v Speaker 1>And that's so brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things you'll notice if </v>

767
00:38:24.241 --> 00:38:27.000
<v Speaker 1>you move into a new apartment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like a cat.</v>

768
00:38:27.090 --> 00:38:27.923
<v Speaker 1>Cats don't like changing houses and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to zoom around in every corner to </v>

769
00:38:30.871 --> 00:38:34.470
<v Speaker 1>see exactly what the hell is going on </v>
<v Speaker 1>there before they calm down.</v>

770
00:38:34.471 --> 00:38:37.750
<v Speaker 1>They need to know they can hide and </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the potential dangers are.</v>

771
00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:38.943
<v Speaker 1>And what you'll find if you move into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>new place that you will not be </v>

772
00:38:41.021 --> 00:38:43.540
<v Speaker 1>comfortable there until you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>investigated,</v>

773
00:38:43.541 --> 00:38:47.590
<v Speaker 1>potentially cleaned and repaired every </v>
<v Speaker 1>single square inch of it,</v>

774
00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:51.610
<v Speaker 1>the more attention you pay to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more it will become yours.</v>

775
00:38:51.611 --> 00:38:54.730
<v Speaker 1>And that's far more than mirror,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like material ownership,</v>

776
00:38:54.731 --> 00:38:55.564
<v Speaker 1>which is also relevant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in order to feel comfortable </v>

777
00:38:57.971 --> 00:39:02.680
<v Speaker 1>somewhere and to dominate that place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be in meshed in that place,</v>

778
00:39:02.890 --> 00:39:04.090
<v Speaker 1>you have to attend to it.</v>

779
00:39:04.090 --> 00:39:04.923
<v Speaker 1>You have to shine light on every corner </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you have to do that with yourself </v>

780
00:39:08.201 --> 00:39:10.840
<v Speaker 1>and with your relationships as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so anyways,</v>

781
00:39:10.841 --> 00:39:15.380
<v Speaker 1>Mufasa tells Simba that his kingdom is </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that the light shines on.</v>

782
00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:18.100
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's a metaphor there too,</v>

783
00:39:18.101 --> 00:39:20.710
<v Speaker 1>which is that what you've shown light </v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

784
00:39:20.711 --> 00:39:21.544
<v Speaker 1>which is what you've come to understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>and master is surrounded by an other </v>

785
00:39:24.491 --> 00:39:27.130
<v Speaker 1>world of all the things that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>

786
00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:28.293
<v Speaker 1>And some of those would be natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>things and some of them would be </v>

787
00:39:29.951 --> 00:39:30.784
<v Speaker 1>tyrannical things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some of those would be things you </v>

788
00:39:32.561 --> 00:39:33.394
<v Speaker 1>don't want to know about yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're outside of where you've </v>

789
00:39:35.771 --> 00:39:36.604
<v Speaker 1>managed to shine the light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's exactly what Mufasa tells </v>

790
00:39:38.951 --> 00:39:39.784
<v Speaker 1>Simba.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

791
00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:42.040
<v Speaker 1>we live in this pyramid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're at the top.</v>

792
00:39:42.041 --> 00:39:45.550
<v Speaker 1>There's a domain of light around it </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's explored territory.</v>

793
00:39:45.790 --> 00:39:48.730
<v Speaker 1>Outside of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's explore unexplored territory.</v>

794
00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:49.773
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly the unconscious </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you fill it with fantasy and </v>

795
00:39:52.541 --> 00:39:57.460
<v Speaker 1>it's partly what you just don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then move fossa tells Simba and it's</v>

796
00:39:57.461 --> 00:40:01.780
<v Speaker 1>sort of like God telling Adam and Eve in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the garden of Eden not to eat the apple.</v>

797
00:40:01.930 --> 00:40:05.770
<v Speaker 1>Mufasa tells Simba there's this outside </v>
<v Speaker 1>place that's dark,</v>

798
00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:09.100
<v Speaker 1>that's not part of your kingdom and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should not go there.</v>

799
00:40:09.370 --> 00:40:12.580
<v Speaker 1>And that's really interesting because </v>
<v Speaker 1>Simba doesn't even know about that place</v>

800
00:40:12.581 --> 00:40:13.414
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so Mufasa is doing something very </v>

801
00:40:15.521 --> 00:40:16.354
<v Speaker 1>contradictory there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like telling them that it exists </v>

802
00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:20.183
<v Speaker 1>and heightening his curiosity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also saying that he should go there </v>

803
00:40:22.571 --> 00:40:26.410
<v Speaker 1>almost ensuring that that's exactly what</v>
<v Speaker 1>Simba is going to do.</v>

804
00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:31.420
<v Speaker 1>You See this in the Pinocchio Movie to </v>
<v Speaker 1>where Pinocchio is planning to jump into</v>

805
00:40:31.421 --> 00:40:32.254
<v Speaker 1>the ocean to go get uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Japan from the underworld and he's </v>

806
00:40:36.131 --> 00:40:38.170
<v Speaker 1>following his conscience is along with </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

807
00:40:38.170 --> 00:40:39.003
<v Speaker 1>Jimminy cricket and the cricket is </v>
<v Speaker 1>warning him about all the dangers that </v>

808
00:40:41.671 --> 00:40:45.460
<v Speaker 1>he'll face down there and telling him </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he will be fish food personally.</v>

809
00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:46.533
<v Speaker 1>And while he's doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio ties a knot around his donkey </v>

810
00:40:49.271 --> 00:40:50.104
<v Speaker 1>tail around rock so he can sink and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>little cricket helps them tie the </v>

811
00:40:53.231 --> 00:40:54.064
<v Speaker 1>naughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So while he's warning them about the </v>

812
00:40:55.571 --> 00:40:57.550
<v Speaker 1>adventure he's going to undertake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the same time,</v>

813
00:40:57.551 --> 00:41:00.670
<v Speaker 1>he's encouraging to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's that paradoxical thing,</v>

814
00:41:00.671 --> 00:41:02.920
<v Speaker 1>which is that if you go outside what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

815
00:41:02.921 --> 00:41:03.754
<v Speaker 1>it will cause a fall because it'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>damage your knowledge structures and </v>

816
00:41:06.821 --> 00:41:09.670
<v Speaker 1>you'll go down into chaos and that can </v>
<v Speaker 1>really destroy you.</v>

817
00:41:09.671 --> 00:41:12.220
<v Speaker 1>So you shouldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But by the same token,</v>

818
00:41:12.221 --> 00:41:14.320
<v Speaker 1>if you do do it and you do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>successfully,</v>

819
00:41:14.530 --> 00:41:15.363
<v Speaker 1>then the new you that arises can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>stronger and more complete than the </v>

820
00:41:18.701 --> 00:41:19.480
<v Speaker 1>previous youth.</v>

821
00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:21.760
<v Speaker 1>So you should do it and you shouldn't do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

822
00:41:21.761 --> 00:41:24.190
<v Speaker 1>And that's anyone sensible says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

823
00:41:24.191 --> 00:41:25.510
<v Speaker 1>don't bother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

824
00:41:25.511 --> 00:41:27.610
<v Speaker 1>but sensible isn't enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>

825
00:41:27.611 --> 00:41:31.210
<v Speaker 1>You have to also be not sensible enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to live.</v>

826
00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:32.223
<v Speaker 1>And your typical hero and potter's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>really good example is always a rule </v>

827
00:41:35.331 --> 00:41:37.280
<v Speaker 1>breaker always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he,</v>

828
00:41:37.281 --> 00:41:38.114
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rules he breaks are like there's </v>

829
00:41:40.131 --> 00:41:40.964
<v Speaker 1>judiciousness behind the rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Breaking the hero breaks a rule in the </v>

830
00:41:44.601 --> 00:41:47.180
<v Speaker 1>service of a higher good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's still breaking the rules.</v>

831
00:41:47.181 --> 00:41:48.014
<v Speaker 1>And that's what puts him outside the </v>
<v Speaker 1>boundary of the social of the social </v>

832
00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:52.010
<v Speaker 1>establishment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

833
00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:54.553
<v Speaker 1>now at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Simba also gets introduced to scar and </v>

834
00:41:58.100 --> 00:41:58.933
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

835
00:41:58.940 --> 00:41:59.773
<v Speaker 1>that has two meanings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is that scar is the tyrannical </v>

836
00:42:02.001 --> 00:42:04.520
<v Speaker 1>element of the state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so as a child,</v>

837
00:42:04.521 --> 00:42:05.354
<v Speaker 1>when you're being socialized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you encounter the tyranny of the state </v>

838
00:42:08.121 --> 00:42:09.710
<v Speaker 1>and one of the best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>

839
00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:10.820
<v Speaker 1>there's no way around it.</v>

840
00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:12.193
<v Speaker 1>One of the best examples of that is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>children are always running around </v>

841
00:42:14.331 --> 00:42:16.130
<v Speaker 1>having fun and they're really bubbly </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

842
00:42:16.290 --> 00:42:21.290
<v Speaker 1>and impulsive and joyous and playful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that causes a lot of trouble because</v>

843
00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:24.710
<v Speaker 1>positive emotion is very disruptive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll run around and break things,</v>

844
00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:26.810
<v Speaker 1>they'll hurt themselves and they'll get </v>
<v Speaker 1>into trouble.</v>

845
00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:29.240
<v Speaker 1>And so you're always saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>calm down,</v>

846
00:42:29.241 --> 00:42:30.380
<v Speaker 1>sit down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>behave,</v>

847
00:42:30.381 --> 00:42:31.214
<v Speaker 1>don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not because they're crying or </v>

848
00:42:32.901 --> 00:42:33.734
<v Speaker 1>angry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because they're so damn happy and </v>

849
00:42:35.211 --> 00:42:39.500
<v Speaker 1>impulsive that no one could stand them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so and so that's a tyranny.</v>

850
00:42:39.501 --> 00:42:41.120
<v Speaker 1>It's like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The state puts,</v>

851
00:42:41.121 --> 00:42:43.550
<v Speaker 1>puts pressure on you to regulate your </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions,</v>

852
00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:46.040
<v Speaker 1>positive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>negative and positive,</v>

853
00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:48.290
<v Speaker 1>and it crushes you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It crushes the life out of you,</v>

854
00:42:48.291 --> 00:42:50.090
<v Speaker 1>a lot of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you end up,</v>

855
00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:50.953
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your age and you're all mopey because </v>

856
00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:54.290
<v Speaker 1>the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially because you've been forced to</v>

857
00:42:54.291 --> 00:42:58.940
<v Speaker 1>sit down in school for like 17 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're all mopey and it's no wonder,</v>

858
00:42:58.941 --> 00:42:59.774
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've had the spirit taken out of you </v>

859
00:43:00.741 --> 00:43:01.574
<v Speaker 1>by the process of discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but without that you'd be completely </v>

860
00:43:03.981 --> 00:43:04.490
<v Speaker 1>useless.</v>

861
00:43:04.490 --> 00:43:06.980
<v Speaker 1>So it's another one of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>paradoxical,</v>

862
00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:08.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gifts.</v>

863
00:43:08.721 --> 00:43:09.554
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and catastrophes that you encounter as </v>

864
00:43:11.421 --> 00:43:13.280
<v Speaker 1>you move through life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

865
00:43:13.310 --> 00:43:14.990
<v Speaker 1>Simba,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at how happy he is.</v>

866
00:43:14.991 --> 00:43:15.621
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

867
00:43:15.621 --> 00:43:17.780
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't know a damn thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's so naive.</v>

868
00:43:17.781 --> 00:43:19.190
<v Speaker 1>You can tell by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh look,</v>

869
00:43:19.191 --> 00:43:20.900
<v Speaker 1>it's so my uncle scar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

870
00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:22.093
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is not a guy you smile at </v>

871
00:43:23.991 --> 00:43:24.824
<v Speaker 1>clearly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's all positive emotion and joy </v>

872
00:43:27.381 --> 00:43:28.214
<v Speaker 1>and enthusiasm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's not good because that means </v>

873
00:43:30.261 --> 00:43:32.570
<v Speaker 1>this character can take serious </v>
<v Speaker 1>advantage of it.</v>

874
00:43:32.571 --> 00:43:36.590
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly what he does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so scarp pretends to be on his side,</v>

875
00:43:36.591 --> 00:43:38.360
<v Speaker 1>which is what a good pedophile always </v>
<v Speaker 1>does,</v>

876
00:43:38.361 --> 00:43:39.920
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

877
00:43:40.250 --> 00:43:40.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

878
00:43:40.810 --> 00:43:44.630
<v Speaker 1>you take advantage of the child's </v>
<v Speaker 1>trusting nature and openness in order to</v>

879
00:43:44.631 --> 00:43:45.770
<v Speaker 1>exploit them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

880
00:43:45.771 --> 00:43:48.080
<v Speaker 1>that's what horrible people do that all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time,</v>

881
00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:51.530
<v Speaker 1>including the parents of children and </v>
<v Speaker 1>other children themselves.</v>

882
00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:52.880
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

883
00:43:52.881 --> 00:43:54.350
<v Speaker 1>there's this false,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been looking at,</v>

884
00:43:54.351 --> 00:43:56.360
<v Speaker 1>the animators are so damn brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

885
00:43:56.660 --> 00:43:58.910
<v Speaker 1>look at that expression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really like,</v>

886
00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:00.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just look at that and you think,</v>

887
00:44:00.501 --> 00:44:02.120
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just a facial expression.</v>

888
00:44:02.121 --> 00:44:05.360
<v Speaker 1>But of course it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some damn animators worked a really hard</v>

889
00:44:05.361 --> 00:44:06.194
<v Speaker 1>to get that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're really observant and they </v>

890
00:44:07.791 --> 00:44:10.070
<v Speaker 1>distill the facial looks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look how big the face is,</v>

891
00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:12.120
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It covers the whole head and,</v>

892
00:44:12.250 --> 00:44:14.810
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've got the eyebrow lifts proper and</v>

893
00:44:14.811 --> 00:44:18.740
<v Speaker 1>they've got this horrible sanctimonious </v>
<v Speaker 1>smile and the tilt of the head then,</v>

894
00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:19.813
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he sort of crushing him while he's </v>

895
00:44:21.051 --> 00:44:23.180
<v Speaker 1>hugging them at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>

896
00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:24.380
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

897
00:44:24.381 --> 00:44:25.214
<v Speaker 1>it took a lot of thought for every </v>
<v Speaker 1>single one of these frames to be put </v>

898
00:44:27.561 --> 00:44:28.340
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

899
00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:31.440
<v Speaker 1>There's a tremendous amount of cognitive</v>
<v Speaker 1>effort that went that.</v>

900
00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:33.150
<v Speaker 1>So none of this is accidental.</v>

901
00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:35.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that pretty much says everything.</v>

902
00:44:35.221 --> 00:44:36.054
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate that kid could hardly wait until </v>

903
00:44:38.251 --> 00:44:41.040
<v Speaker 1>he's gone and didn't die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pull one over on them.</v>

904
00:44:41.041 --> 00:44:41.874
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a real testament to an adult's </v>

905
00:44:43.111 --> 00:44:47.640
<v Speaker 1>genius when he can fool a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then Simba encounters the anima.</v>

906
00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:48.743
<v Speaker 1>That's the anima,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Union Anima and the Anima is the </v>

907
00:44:51.301 --> 00:44:54.900
<v Speaker 1>feminine counterpart in the soul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she,</v>

908
00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:57.510
<v Speaker 1>well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could tell what she does to him,</v>

909
00:44:57.511 --> 00:44:58.344
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because she's got this super silly </v>

910
00:44:59.821 --> 00:45:00.654
<v Speaker 1>ascend and what would you say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Judgemental and Teasey look on her face </v>

911
00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:06.990
<v Speaker 1>and she's really tried to put him down </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's working like bad.</v>

912
00:45:06.991 --> 00:45:10.050
<v Speaker 1>He's not very happy about that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she's the thing,</v>

913
00:45:10.051 --> 00:45:12.000
<v Speaker 1>this is what the enema does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the soul,</v>

914
00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:16.260
<v Speaker 1>she's the thing that teaches the </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploratory hero that,</v>

915
00:45:16.650 --> 00:45:19.020
<v Speaker 1>that it's not everything it could be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

916
00:45:19.021 --> 00:45:21.780
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of this can be read </v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple ways,</v>

917
00:45:21.781 --> 00:45:22.614
<v Speaker 1>but it's part of the eternal tendency of</v>
<v Speaker 1>women to make men self conscious by </v>

918
00:45:26.671 --> 00:45:28.080
<v Speaker 1>their sexual subjectivity.</v>

919
00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:31.740
<v Speaker 1>That's part of it because that makes men</v>
<v Speaker 1>self conscious like nothing else.</v>

920
00:45:31.741 --> 00:45:32.574
<v Speaker 1>And it's also perhaps being one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomena that's produced the </v>

921
00:45:35.341 --> 00:45:38.220
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary arms race in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this sex,</v>

922
00:45:38.221 --> 00:45:41.850
<v Speaker 1>is it among human beings that's caused </v>
<v Speaker 1>our rapid cortical expansion and our,</v>

923
00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:44.760
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our quick movement away from chimpanzees</v>

924
00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:48.690
<v Speaker 1>who aren't selective majors by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So look at him.</v>

925
00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:50.250
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just want to slap him,</v>

926
00:45:50.251 --> 00:45:51.120
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's uh,</v>

927
00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:53.310
<v Speaker 1>he's the son of a king,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he's very,</v>

928
00:45:53.311 --> 00:45:56.580
<v Speaker 1>very privileged and he confuses his </v>
<v Speaker 1>privilege with competence.</v>

929
00:45:56.850 --> 00:45:57.683
<v Speaker 1>Richard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course all of you do because you are </v>

930
00:45:58.651 --> 00:45:59.484
<v Speaker 1>all sons of the king,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why you can sit here in the </v>

931
00:46:00.961 --> 00:46:01.794
<v Speaker 1>university and you confuse your </v>
<v Speaker 1>privilege with competence as well </v>

932
00:46:05.370 --> 00:46:06.203
<v Speaker 1>because it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has nothing to do with any of you that </v>

933
00:46:08.521 --> 00:46:10.710
<v Speaker 1>the lights are on and it's place is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>peaceful.</v>

934
00:46:10.711 --> 00:46:12.810
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you take that for granted and it can</v>

935
00:46:12.811 --> 00:46:15.540
<v Speaker 1>make you false and arrogant like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Jesus.</v>

936
00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:17.670
<v Speaker 1>That's just so sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You look at that kid,</v>

937
00:46:17.671 --> 00:46:19.900
<v Speaker 1>you think he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's in for real trouble,</v>

938
00:46:19.901 --> 00:46:21.630
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thinks he knows everything.</v>

939
00:46:21.631 --> 00:46:24.330
<v Speaker 1>And of course that he has a wrestling </v>
<v Speaker 1>match with,</v>

940
00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:26.940
<v Speaker 1>what's her name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's it,</v>

941
00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:28.680
<v Speaker 1>was it Nala?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

942
00:46:28.681 --> 00:46:31.620
<v Speaker 1>it has a wrestling match with knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She just pins him every time.</v>

943
00:46:31.621 --> 00:46:32.460
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gotcha.</v>

944
00:46:32.461 --> 00:46:33.294
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pinned the again and that's basically </v>

945
00:46:34.921 --> 00:46:35.754
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that happens with men </v>

946
00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:40.130
<v Speaker 1>when they meet a woman who they really </v>
<v Speaker 1>desire and admires,</v>

947
00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:42.600
<v Speaker 1>they project an ideal onto her </v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately.</v>

948
00:46:42.601 --> 00:46:44.580
<v Speaker 1>That's an anima projection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that Adam,</v>

949
00:46:44.581 --> 00:46:47.520
<v Speaker 1>a projection judges them and they act </v>
<v Speaker 1>all inferior and stupid.</v>

950
00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:49.860
<v Speaker 1>And it's partly because they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why.</v>

951
00:46:50.250 --> 00:46:51.083
<v Speaker 1>And so then they go down in defeat </v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly to this thing that they're </v>

952
00:46:54.661 --> 00:46:57.030
<v Speaker 1>projecting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which at least has some concordance with</v>

953
00:46:57.031 --> 00:46:58.830
<v Speaker 1>the actual woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not that much.</v>

954
00:46:59.220 --> 00:46:59.851
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

955
00:46:59.851 --> 00:47:02.880
<v Speaker 1>they keep wrestling and then they're on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fringe of the kingdom.</v>

956
00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:03.713
<v Speaker 1>This wrestling match between this pairs </v>
<v Speaker 1>of opposites takes them to the edge of </v>

957
00:47:07.261 --> 00:47:09.660
<v Speaker 1>the kingdom and they end up in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>elephants' graveyard.</v>

958
00:47:09.661 --> 00:47:10.920
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

959
00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:12.750
<v Speaker 1>and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's bones everywhere.</v>

960
00:47:12.751 --> 00:47:14.700
<v Speaker 1>And so now they're out into the Kingdom </v>
<v Speaker 1>of death.</v>

961
00:47:14.701 --> 00:47:17.880
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is that these two </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids,</v>

962
00:47:17.881 --> 00:47:19.890
<v Speaker 1>as they've grown up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>encountered death,</v>

963
00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:22.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go outside the light and it's very,</v>

964
00:47:22.441 --> 00:47:25.320
<v Speaker 1>very shocking for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're very curious about it.</v>

965
00:47:25.321 --> 00:47:28.380
<v Speaker 1>Obviously they go to explore the </v>
<v Speaker 1>skeletons and all of that,</v>

966
00:47:28.381 --> 00:47:30.880
<v Speaker 1>even though they were not to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but their curiosity,</v>

967
00:47:30.881 --> 00:47:34.600
<v Speaker 1>they can't stay away from death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are too curious about it.</v>

968
00:47:34.601 --> 00:47:37.150
<v Speaker 1>And so they develop knowledge of death </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that.</v>

969
00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:39.400
<v Speaker 1>And then of course out there in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dead,</v>

970
00:47:39.401 --> 00:47:41.860
<v Speaker 1>lounds is where the hyenas are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly right.</v>

971
00:47:41.861 --> 00:47:43.510
<v Speaker 1>Cause Hyenas are scavengers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

972
00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:45.460
<v Speaker 1>And they can break bones with their </v>
<v Speaker 1>teeth.</v>

973
00:47:45.461 --> 00:47:47.890
<v Speaker 1>They're really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really quite the animal.</v>

974
00:47:47.890 --> 00:47:50.740
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you kind of have a shudder of repugnance</v>

975
00:47:50.741 --> 00:47:53.050
<v Speaker 1>when you see those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's partly,</v>

976
00:47:53.051 --> 00:47:55.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we shared an evolutionary landscape with</v>

977
00:47:55.571 --> 00:47:58.180
<v Speaker 1>the ancestors of hyenas for a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very long time.</v>

978
00:47:58.181 --> 00:47:59.830
<v Speaker 1>And like vultures too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

979
00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:04.450
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't imagine something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be more well designed to look like</v>

980
00:48:04.451 --> 00:48:07.180
<v Speaker 1>it was a horrible thing than a vulture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

981
00:48:07.181 --> 00:48:08.014
<v Speaker 1>And there's this weird concordance and </v>
<v Speaker 1>crows and ravens are like that to carry </v>

982
00:48:11.411 --> 00:48:12.250
<v Speaker 1>an eaters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

983
00:48:12.670 --> 00:48:13.503
<v Speaker 1>eagles are kind of an exception,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they look just as creepy as they </v>

984
00:48:15.881 --> 00:48:17.980
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really quite interesting.</v>

985
00:48:17.981 --> 00:48:21.220
<v Speaker 1>And of course hyenas fall into that </v>
<v Speaker 1>category and they laugh too,</v>

986
00:48:21.221 --> 00:48:22.330
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

987
00:48:22.570 --> 00:48:23.403
<v Speaker 1>really you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you also have to laugh really with all </v>

988
00:48:25.691 --> 00:48:27.340
<v Speaker 1>these other things you have going for </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

989
00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:28.453
<v Speaker 1>And anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hyenas and hyenas are enemies of </v>

990
00:48:30.371 --> 00:48:32.860
<v Speaker 1>lions and they can take lions down their</v>
<v Speaker 1>tough things.</v>

991
00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:35.440
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not one hyena obviously,</v>

992
00:48:35.441 --> 00:48:38.500
<v Speaker 1>but a bunch of hyenas can give a line </v>
<v Speaker 1>and pretty damn rough time.</v>

993
00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:39.753
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and these little lines are really no </v>

994
00:48:41.771 --> 00:48:44.590
<v Speaker 1>match for the hyenas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they get threatened very,</v>

995
00:48:44.591 --> 00:48:46.980
<v Speaker 1>very rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the hygienists,</v>

996
00:48:46.990 --> 00:48:49.030
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just completely out of its mind.</v>

997
00:48:49.450 --> 00:48:50.283
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting and you see this with the </v>

998
00:48:52.481 --> 00:48:54.760
<v Speaker 1>muppets too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was often a puppet that was like a</v>

999
00:48:54.761 --> 00:48:57.400
<v Speaker 1>crazy puppet and its eyes would move in </v>
<v Speaker 1>different directions.</v>

1000
00:48:57.730 --> 00:48:58.563
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things that happens with </v>

1001
00:48:59.291 --> 00:49:02.410
<v Speaker 1>people who are schizophrenia as they </v>
<v Speaker 1>show involuntary eye movements,</v>

1002
00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:03.513
<v Speaker 1>and it's because you have a brain center</v>
<v Speaker 1>that controls your eyes voluntarily and </v>

1003
00:49:06.611 --> 00:49:08.830
<v Speaker 1>you have another one that controls them </v>
<v Speaker 1>in voluntarily.</v>

1004
00:49:08.831 --> 00:49:09.664
<v Speaker 1>So you can see that look ahead and try </v>
<v Speaker 1>to move your eyes smoothly back and </v>

1005
00:49:12.821 --> 00:49:13.510
<v Speaker 1>forth.</v>

1006
00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:15.370
<v Speaker 1>You can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll see that they jerk,</v>

1007
00:49:15.490 --> 00:49:16.660
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you watch,</v>

1008
00:49:16.810 --> 00:49:19.360
<v Speaker 1>put a finger in front of your face and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then do this,</v>

1009
00:49:19.630 --> 00:49:20.463
<v Speaker 1>they'll move perfectly smoothly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's because you're using </v>

1010
00:49:22.391 --> 00:49:26.350
<v Speaker 1>different eye control centers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one voluntary and one more involuntary.</v>

1011
00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:28.990
<v Speaker 1>And the involuntary one is actually more</v>
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated.</v>

1012
00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:33.460
<v Speaker 1>And so in schizophrenia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the involuntary eye control centers tend</v>

1013
00:49:33.461 --> 00:49:36.100
<v Speaker 1>to disrupt the voluntary eye control </v>
<v Speaker 1>centers.</v>

1014
00:49:36.101 --> 00:49:39.640
<v Speaker 1>And that's likely part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hallucinatory process,</v>

1015
00:49:39.641 --> 00:49:40.474
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you have the ego in the </v>

1016
00:49:41.691 --> 00:49:42.524
<v Speaker 1>schizophrenia that's being disrupted by </v>
<v Speaker 1>processes underneath fantasies and that </v>

1017
00:49:45.911 --> 00:49:49.090
<v Speaker 1>sort of thing that looks like it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>reflected in involuntary eye movements,</v>

1018
00:49:49.091 --> 00:49:50.530
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like dream movements.</v>

1019
00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:51.693
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much for the crazy hyena and they're </v>

1020
00:49:54.011 --> 00:49:54.844
<v Speaker 1>in real trouble now the kings I who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be keeping an eye on this </v>

1021
00:49:57.401 --> 00:50:00.220
<v Speaker 1>and we're supposed to be watching Simba </v>
<v Speaker 1>is trying to intervene,</v>

1022
00:50:00.221 --> 00:50:03.190
<v Speaker 1>but I mean look at him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like delicious little bird.</v>

1023
00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:06.550
<v Speaker 1>And so that's not working out very well </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>

1024
00:50:06.551 --> 00:50:11.551
<v Speaker 1>And then you see this immediate </v>
<v Speaker 1>juxtaposition of the domain of death and</v>

1025
00:50:12.011 --> 00:50:14.080
<v Speaker 1>the hyenas with hell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1026
00:50:14.081 --> 00:50:15.490
<v Speaker 1>And everyone looks at that and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

1027
00:50:15.491 --> 00:50:15.810
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1028
00:50:15.810 --> 00:50:16.643
<v Speaker 1>they know exactly what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's no surprise to anyone that that </v>

1029
00:50:18.821 --> 00:50:19.654
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I suppose that's partly because on </v>

1030
00:50:21.731 --> 00:50:26.731
<v Speaker 1>the velt where we evolved in large part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not by no means all part fire was an</v>

1031
00:50:26.771 --> 00:50:28.940
<v Speaker 1>ever present danger in the grasslands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1032
00:50:28.970 --> 00:50:30.500
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

1033
00:50:30.501 --> 00:50:31.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good,</v>

1034
00:50:31.970 --> 00:50:34.370
<v Speaker 1>that's a good example of hail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1035
00:50:35.290 --> 00:50:36.920
<v Speaker 1>Huh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well</v>

1036
00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:39.343
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll do some more of this when we meet </v>

1037
00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:42.920
<v Speaker 1>on Tuesday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bye.</v>
