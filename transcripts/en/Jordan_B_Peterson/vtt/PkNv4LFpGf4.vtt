1
00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:05.800
<v Speaker 1>Many of you will no doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember Lindsay Shepherd,</v>

2
00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:07.383
<v Speaker 1>she was the teaching assistant in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Department of communications at Wilfrid </v>

3
00:00:10.331 --> 00:00:11.164
<v Speaker 1>laurier university who was subjected to </v>
<v Speaker 1>a three member panel of inquiry after </v>

4
00:00:14.831 --> 00:00:15.664
<v Speaker 1>she showed a video taken from Canadian </v>
<v Speaker 1>public television of me debating the </v>

5
00:00:19.181 --> 00:00:22.620
<v Speaker 1>compelled speech legislation introduced </v>
<v Speaker 1>in federal bills.</v>

6
00:00:22.621 --> 00:00:23.454
<v Speaker 1>See 16 she showed my discussion with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nicholas Matt who held the opposite </v>

7
00:00:27.701 --> 00:00:28.534
<v Speaker 1>position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here is part of the discussion and </v>

8
00:00:31.151 --> 00:00:33.280
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do we do this?</v>

9
00:00:33.281 --> 00:00:34.114
<v Speaker 1>Let's take a moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to explain a few basic </v>

10
00:00:35.171 --> 00:00:36.004
<v Speaker 1>things here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The issue of so called non traditional </v>

11
00:00:37.721 --> 00:00:40.630
<v Speaker 1>pronouns goes together with </v>
<v Speaker 1>nontraditional gender identities.</v>

12
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.720
<v Speaker 1>New York City for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>recognizes 31 such gender expressions.</v>

13
00:00:45.881 --> 00:00:47.380
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>besides man and woman,</v>

14
00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.250
<v Speaker 1>there are 29 other gender expressions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

15
00:00:51.251 --> 00:00:52.720
<v Speaker 1>Penn Gender Queer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gender,</v>

16
00:00:52.721 --> 00:00:53.554
<v Speaker 1>gender fluid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crossdresser by gendered gender blender </v>

17
00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.590
<v Speaker 1>and the list goes on and Nicholas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is where I want to bring you in the</v>

18
00:00:59.591 --> 00:01:02.810
<v Speaker 1>discussion because you teach this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you teach trans studies,</v>

19
00:01:02.811 --> 00:01:03.644
<v Speaker 1>so if you would give us a brief primer </v>
<v Speaker 1>on so many gender identities that in </v>

20
00:01:08.501 --> 00:01:12.250
<v Speaker 1>your view require non traditional </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronouns.</v>

21
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:13.263
<v Speaker 1>Basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not correct that there is such a </v>

22
00:01:16.571 --> 00:01:19.420
<v Speaker 1>thing as biological sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm a historian of medicine.</v>

23
00:01:19.421 --> 00:01:22.210
<v Speaker 1>I can unpack that for you at great </v>
<v Speaker 1>length if you want.</v>

24
00:01:22.211 --> 00:01:24.490
<v Speaker 1>But in the interest of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't.</v>

25
00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.700
<v Speaker 1>The three member panel included </v>
<v Speaker 1>professors,</v>

26
00:01:27.701 --> 00:01:28.960
<v Speaker 1>Nathan Ramboo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canna,</v>

27
00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:29.943
<v Speaker 1>her supervisor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her bird Pimlott in charge of the </v>

28
00:01:32.171 --> 00:01:33.004
<v Speaker 1>master's program and Adriana Joel </v>
<v Speaker 1>Manager of gendered violence and sexual </v>

29
00:01:37.361 --> 00:01:38.194
<v Speaker 1>assault prevention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shepherd tape the meeting and released </v>

30
00:01:41.321 --> 00:01:42.154
<v Speaker 1>it publicly producing what I think was </v>
<v Speaker 1>the biggest scandal that ever envelop </v>

31
00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:46.203
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canadian University and certainly the </v>

32
00:01:47.621 --> 00:01:51.070
<v Speaker 1>only one in living memory that became </v>
<v Speaker 1>news internationally.</v>

33
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.040
<v Speaker 2>Nothing has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you share people from those ideas?</v>

34
00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:55.653
<v Speaker 2>Am I supposed to come for them and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make sure that they are insulated away </v>

35
00:01:59.051 --> 00:02:00.100
<v Speaker 2>from this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like is that,</v>

36
00:02:00.101 --> 00:02:00.934
<v Speaker 2>what's the point of this is because to </v>
<v Speaker 2>me that is so against what a university </v>

37
00:02:04.871 --> 00:02:06.460
<v Speaker 2>is about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So against it,</v>

38
00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.310
<v Speaker 2>I was not taking sides.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was presenting both arguments.</v>

39
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.183
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the thing of it is about this is if </v>

40
00:02:14.171 --> 00:02:16.540
<v Speaker 2>you're presenting something like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

41
00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:17.583
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to think about the kind of </v>

42
00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.800
<v Speaker 2>teaching climate that you're creating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is actually,</v>

43
00:02:23.801 --> 00:02:28.801
<v Speaker 2>these arguments are counter to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Canadian human rights code.</v>

44
00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.690
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever since I know that you talked about,</v>

45
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.990
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] ever since this past,</v>

46
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.670
<v Speaker 2>it is discriminatory to be targeting </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone,</v>

47
00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:40.803
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>due to their gender identity or gender </v>

48
00:02:42.551 --> 00:02:43.384
<v Speaker 2>expression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So bringing something like that up in </v>

49
00:02:45.641 --> 00:02:47.230
<v Speaker 2>class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not critically,</v>

50
00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.880
<v Speaker 2>and I understand that you're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

51
00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:49.743
<v Speaker 2>it was critical.</v>

52
00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.310
<v Speaker 2>I introduced it critically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How so?</v>

53
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:54.560
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

54
00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.530
<v Speaker 2>it was in the spirit of debate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

55
00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.060
<v Speaker 2>In the spirit of the debate is slightly </v>
<v Speaker 2>different than being like,</v>

56
00:03:01.061 --> 00:03:01.750
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

57
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.500
<v Speaker 2>this is like a problematic idea that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>want when we want to unpack.</v>

58
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:06.423
<v Speaker 2>But that's taking sides.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's taking sides for me to be </v>

59
00:03:09.041 --> 00:03:09.701
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

60
00:03:09.701 --> 00:03:10.534
<v Speaker 2>look at this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like everything that comes out of his </v>

61
00:03:11.681 --> 00:03:13.330
<v Speaker 2>mouth is bs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're going to watch anyway.</v>

62
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:14.283
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I understand the position that you </v>

63
00:03:17.001 --> 00:03:22.001
<v Speaker 2>were coming from and your positionality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the reality is that it has created a</v>

64
00:03:22.721 --> 00:03:25.970
<v Speaker 2>toxic climate for some of the students.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

65
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.000
<v Speaker 2>you know how many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's great.</v>

66
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:29.590
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how many,</v>

67
00:03:29.591 --> 00:03:30.424
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

68
00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:31.570
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>May I speak?</v>

69
00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.353
<v Speaker 2>I have no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no concept of of like how many </v>

70
00:03:35.801 --> 00:03:38.080
<v Speaker 2>people complained like what their </v>
<v Speaker 2>complaint was.</v>

71
00:03:38.081 --> 00:03:40.510
<v Speaker 2>You haven't showed me the complaint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

72
00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.510
<v Speaker 2>I understand that this is upsetting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's also confidential at the end</v>

73
00:03:44.511 --> 00:03:47.680
<v Speaker 2>of confidentiality matters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The number of people's confidential.</v>

74
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.633
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

75
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.553
<v Speaker 1>Although the university apologize </v>
<v Speaker 1>publicly for its treatment of shepherd </v>

76
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:53.243
<v Speaker 1>as did Ramboo Kenna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is not clear at all that the powers </v>

77
00:03:55.831 --> 00:03:56.664
<v Speaker 1>that be so to speak learned their lesson</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the mistreatment of shepherd not </v>

78
00:04:00.391 --> 00:04:05.391
<v Speaker 1>only continued but arguably intensified,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so she decided to press her case legally</v>

79
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.033
<v Speaker 1>and presented the statement of claim </v>
<v Speaker 1>against the three and Wilfred laurier </v>

80
00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.160
<v Speaker 1>early in the second week of June.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It lists in painful detail the many ways</v>

81
00:04:16.531 --> 00:04:17.364
<v Speaker 1>that this situation was mishandled </v>
<v Speaker 1>during and after the initial </v>

82
00:04:20.101 --> 00:04:20.934
<v Speaker 1>inquisition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also discussed the situation with </v>

83
00:04:24.151 --> 00:04:28.920
<v Speaker 1>Howard Levitt shepherds lawyer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I decided that Wilford Loria had learned</v>

84
00:04:28.921 --> 00:04:29.754
<v Speaker 1>very little from its public </v>
<v Speaker 1>embarrassment and the shepherds claims </v>

85
00:04:32.161 --> 00:04:35.010
<v Speaker 1>were valid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>justifiable and necessary,</v>

86
00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.053
<v Speaker 1>including her statement that our future </v>
<v Speaker 1>lack of employability in academia was </v>

87
00:04:39.691 --> 00:04:44.310
<v Speaker 1>improbable to say the least.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been on hiring committees and I can</v>

88
00:04:44.311 --> 00:04:48.450
<v Speaker 1>tell you that even then the slightest </v>
<v Speaker 1>whiff of scandal is enough to disqualify</v>

89
00:04:48.451 --> 00:04:51.660
<v Speaker 1>a candidate</v>
<v Speaker 1>and consequence.</v>

90
00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.920
<v Speaker 1>Not only did I decide to read and post </v>
<v Speaker 1>the entirety of shepherds claims,</v>

91
00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.843
<v Speaker 1>which I will do in a few minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also decided to launch a claim of my </v>

92
00:04:59.671 --> 00:05:00.504
<v Speaker 1>own against the same defendants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that two lawsuits might make </v>

93
00:05:03.991 --> 00:05:04.824
<v Speaker 1>the point better than one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll read some of my claim to after </v>

94
00:05:08.551 --> 00:05:09.384
<v Speaker 1>shepherds and you can all make up your </v>
<v Speaker 1>own minds about the suitability of this </v>

95
00:05:12.841 --> 00:05:13.770
<v Speaker 1>course of action.</v>

96

<v Speaker 1>Ontario Superior Court of Justice </v>
<v Speaker 1>between Lindsay Shepherd,</v>

152
00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:20.003
<v Speaker 1>who had only met with Shepard twice </v>
<v Speaker 1>about his course and only then briefly </v>

153
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:27.330
<v Speaker 1>ironically given his complaint against </v>
<v Speaker 1>her as delineated below.</v>

154
00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.313
<v Speaker 1>He provided her with very limited </v>
<v Speaker 1>direction as to the content to provide </v>

155
00:09:31.231 --> 00:09:32.064
<v Speaker 1>to her students in his classes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The topic for one of our communication </v>

156
00:09:36.181 --> 00:09:40.170
<v Speaker 1>classes held on November 1st,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2017 was grammar.</v>

157
00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:41.453
<v Speaker 1>She taught three classes that day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shepherd introduced the topic of the </v>

158
00:09:45.151 --> 00:09:45.984
<v Speaker 1>grammatical correctness of gender </v>
<v Speaker 1>neutral language in the evolution of </v>

159
00:09:48.991 --> 00:09:49.824
<v Speaker 1>various languages and do facilitate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Discussion on this subject showed a </v>

160
00:09:53.671 --> 00:09:54.504
<v Speaker 1>field minute extract from a TV Ontario </v>
<v Speaker 1>program moderated by and Pakan </v>

161
00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:00.023
<v Speaker 1>consisting of a debate between professor</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jordan Peterson of the University of </v>

162
00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:05.603
<v Speaker 1>Toronto,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Psychology Department and Nicholas Matt </v>

163
00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:09.960
<v Speaker 1>from the University of Toronto's sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>diversity studies program,</v>

164
00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:13.163
<v Speaker 1>Peterson and Nicholas Matt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're debating compelled gender </v>

165
00:10:15.211 --> 00:10:16.044
<v Speaker 1>pronouns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peterson argued against being required </v>

166
00:10:18.181 --> 00:10:19.014
<v Speaker 1>to use these new words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which he argued had not developed </v>

167
00:10:21.421 --> 00:10:22.254
<v Speaker 1>organically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matt took an opposing position shortly </v>

168
00:10:25.921 --> 00:10:26.754
<v Speaker 1>following that class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ramboo Kana ordered her to attend a </v>

169
00:10:28.801 --> 00:10:29.634
<v Speaker 1>meeting the very next day with himself </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pimlott the program coordinator for the </v>

170
00:10:33.691 --> 00:10:34.524
<v Speaker 1>entire Master's program and Adrian Joel </v>
<v Speaker 1>Acting Director of the diversity and </v>

171
00:10:38.611 --> 00:10:39.540
<v Speaker 1>equity office.</v>

172
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:40.823
<v Speaker 1>Both Rambo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kana and Pimlott had considerable </v>

173
00:10:42.571 --> 00:10:45.120
<v Speaker 1>authority over shepherds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fate at the university,</v>

174
00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:50.400
<v Speaker 1>apparently so to Joel Shepherd had never</v>
<v Speaker 1>been called into such a meeting.</v>

175
00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:51.713
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rambo Kana to that point had barely </v>

176
00:10:53.311 --> 00:10:56.580
<v Speaker 1>acknowledged her existence at this </v>
<v Speaker 1>session.</v>

177
00:10:56.610 --> 00:11:00.360
<v Speaker 1>All three lambasted shepherd viciously </v>
<v Speaker 1>attacking her personally,</v>

178
00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:01.343
<v Speaker 1>falsely alleging that there had been a </v>
<v Speaker 1>complaint or complaints about her </v>

179
00:11:03.871 --> 00:11:07.560
<v Speaker 1>tutorial and insisting that in playing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the TV Ontario clip,</v>

180
00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.690
<v Speaker 1>she had been threatening to her </v>
<v Speaker 1>students.</v>

181
00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:11.213
<v Speaker 1>Ramboo Kanick claimed that are showing </v>
<v Speaker 1>this TV Ontario clip breached the </v>

182
00:11:14.341 --> 00:11:17.700
<v Speaker 1>Charter of rights and freedoms and </v>
<v Speaker 1>federal bill [inaudible],</v>

183
00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:20.790
<v Speaker 1>which is not even govern provincially </v>
<v Speaker 1>regulated universities,</v>

184
00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:24.420
<v Speaker 1>created an unsafe learning environment </v>
<v Speaker 1>and was illegal.</v>

185
00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:25.823
<v Speaker 1>Shepherd was accused of Targeting Trans </v>
<v Speaker 1>folks even though Shepard had chosen no </v>

186
00:11:29.311 --> 00:11:33.480
<v Speaker 1>side had up until that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disagreed with what she understood to be</v>

187
00:11:33.481 --> 00:11:37.320
<v Speaker 1>Peterson's perspective and presented the</v>
<v Speaker 1>arguments and the debate neutrally.</v>

188
00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:38.723
<v Speaker 1>Rambo Kana attacked and slandered </v>
<v Speaker 1>Peterson claiming that he was part of </v>

189
00:11:41.491 --> 00:11:42.324
<v Speaker 1>the alt right and that playing a clip of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peterson without first providing any </v>

190
00:11:45.751 --> 00:11:50.751
<v Speaker 1>previous context to the students was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like neutrally playing a speech by Adolf</v>

191
00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:51.683
<v Speaker 1>Hitler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shepherd argued the doing is he asked </v>

192
00:11:53.981 --> 00:11:56.440
<v Speaker 1>would be taking sides and that was not </v>
<v Speaker 1>her role.</v>

193
00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:57.603
<v Speaker 1>She was then further rebuked for taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>that position at various points during </v>

194
00:12:01.751 --> 00:12:04.720
<v Speaker 1>that almost hour long vicious and </v>
<v Speaker 1>abusive attack,</v>

195
00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:08.140
<v Speaker 1>shepherd was reduced to tears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ironically,</v>

196
00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.153
<v Speaker 1>rather than being a present day </v>
<v Speaker 1>personification of Adolf Hitler as </v>

197
00:12:11.831 --> 00:12:16.180
<v Speaker 1>Ramboo county implied Jordan Peterson </v>
<v Speaker 1>has spent decades educating his students</v>

198
00:12:16.181 --> 00:12:17.014
<v Speaker 1>about the evils of the Holocaust and </v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically as part of his </v>

199
00:12:19.901 --> 00:12:20.734
<v Speaker 1>psychological teachings has studied and </v>
<v Speaker 1>taught how individuals degenerate </v>

200
00:12:23.681 --> 00:12:25.930
<v Speaker 1>ethically to the point where they take </v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

201
00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:28.410
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

202
00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:30.930
<v Speaker 1>To the point where they take part in </v>
<v Speaker 1>atrocities.</v>

203
00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:33.473
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

204
00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:34.533
<v Speaker 1>As part of his psychological teachings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has studied and taught how </v>

205
00:12:37.151 --> 00:12:37.984
<v Speaker 1>individuals degenerate ethically to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>point where they take part in </v>

206
00:12:40.691 --> 00:12:43.090
<v Speaker 1>atrocities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>During the meeting,</v>

207
00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:46.720
<v Speaker 1>shepherd was effectively attack as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>protege and supporter of Peterson.</v>

208
00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:48.183
<v Speaker 1>Pimlott continued to libel Peterson </v>
<v Speaker 1>explaining that people like him live in </v>

209
00:12:51.311 --> 00:12:52.144
<v Speaker 1>a fantasy world of false conspiracy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>accusing Shepard of being an agent of </v>

210
00:12:56.021 --> 00:12:56.854
<v Speaker 1>those ideas because she had neutrally </v>
<v Speaker 1>shown this video with it's opposing </v>

211
00:12:59.861 --> 00:13:00.694
<v Speaker 1>viewpoints.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ramboo can have falsely but </v>

212
00:13:02.831 --> 00:13:03.664
<v Speaker 1>imaginatively claimed that shepherd </v>
<v Speaker 1>herself was targeting people based on </v>

213
00:13:07.031 --> 00:13:07.864
<v Speaker 1>their gender identity or gender </v>
<v Speaker 1>expression and in doing so had violated </v>

214
00:13:11.501 --> 00:13:15.970
<v Speaker 1>the Federal Human Rights Code of Bill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See 16 although shepherds conduct was in</v>

215
00:13:15.971 --> 00:13:18.460
<v Speaker 1>no way violet of of that or any law.</v>

216
00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:19.783
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

217
00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:20.633
<v Speaker 1>Sheppard asked the individual defendants</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether her job as a teaching assistant </v>

218
00:13:23.341 --> 00:13:25.950
<v Speaker 1>was to shield her students from debate </v>
<v Speaker 1>and ideas.</v>

219
00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:27.113
<v Speaker 1>Ramboo Kana asserted that it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then accused her of targeting </v>

220
00:13:29.941 --> 00:13:32.640
<v Speaker 1>students due to their gender expression </v>
<v Speaker 1>and identity.</v>

221
00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:36.180
<v Speaker 1>When Shepard pointed out that she had </v>
<v Speaker 1>not taken sides in this debate,</v>

222
00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:39.510
<v Speaker 1>the three rebuked her for creating a </v>
<v Speaker 1>toxic climate.</v>

223
00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:41.183
<v Speaker 1>The three refused to advise shepherd </v>
<v Speaker 1>what the complaint was or who </v>

224
00:13:44.521 --> 00:13:45.354
<v Speaker 1>complained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>claiming that even the number of </v>

225
00:13:47.101 --> 00:13:51.210
<v Speaker 1>complaints was confidential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As was subsequently ascertained,</v>

226
00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.220
<v Speaker 1>there had been no complaint at all.</v>

227
00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:54.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

228
00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:54.983
<v Speaker 1>shepherd protested that she did not </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand how we're teaching methods </v>

229
00:13:57.571 --> 00:13:58.404
<v Speaker 1>constituted any disservice to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>university since the idea is in the </v>

230
00:14:01.231 --> 00:14:03.720
<v Speaker 1>video were already part of social </v>
<v Speaker 1>currency.</v>

231
00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:09.180
<v Speaker 1>Joel responded without any foundation </v>
<v Speaker 1>accusing her of spreading transphobia.</v>

232
00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.033
<v Speaker 1>Ramboo Kana added to jewel's attack by </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially comparing her actions to </v>

233
00:14:14.581 --> 00:14:15.414
<v Speaker 1>white supremacy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Contrary to the allegations of the </v>

234
00:14:18.241 --> 00:14:19.074
<v Speaker 1>defendants at this meeting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shepherd conducted herself at this </v>

235
00:14:21.631 --> 00:14:22.464
<v Speaker 1>seminar precisely as her role required </v>
<v Speaker 1>and singularly represented the </v>

236
00:14:25.681 --> 00:14:29.490
<v Speaker 1>principles of the Wilfrid laurier </v>
<v Speaker 1>university act for this,</v>

237
00:14:29.491 --> 00:14:33.060
<v Speaker 1>she was viciously attacked by Rambo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canna Pimlott and Joel.</v>

238
00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:36.360
<v Speaker 1>They continued to abuse her even after </v>
<v Speaker 1>she began sobbing,</v>

239
00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:40.080
<v Speaker 1>accusing Shepard of causing harm to </v>
<v Speaker 1>unnamed students.</v>

240
00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.590
<v Speaker 1>Shepherd apologized for crying during </v>
<v Speaker 1>the meeting.</v>

241
00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:44.513
<v Speaker 1>Pleading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am stressed out because to me this is </v>

242
00:14:46.831 --> 00:14:47.664
<v Speaker 1>wrong so wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>noting that the very spirit of the </v>

243
00:14:50.311 --> 00:14:54.770
<v Speaker 1>university to challenge ideas that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>already have and reminding them that she</v>

244
00:14:54.771 --> 00:14:56.720
<v Speaker 1>had not taken any side or position.</v>

245
00:14:58.070 --> 00:14:58.903
<v Speaker 1>The meeting concluded with Shepard being</v>
<v Speaker 1>advised even after she promised to show </v>

246
00:15:01.941 --> 00:15:06.680
<v Speaker 1>no further videos of Peterson or </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything of the like that she now had to</v>

247
00:15:06.681 --> 00:15:11.540
<v Speaker 1>run all of her seminar notes passed </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ramboo Kenna to obtain specific approval</v>

248
00:15:11.541 --> 00:15:12.374
<v Speaker 1>for any future clips of anyone that she </v>
<v Speaker 1>attended to show and that Rambo Canna </v>

249
00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:18.920
<v Speaker 1>might have to sit in on her future </v>
<v Speaker 1>classes.</v>

250
00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:22.340
<v Speaker 1>She was prohibited from showing any </v>
<v Speaker 1>further videos.</v>

251
00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:25.610
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they suggested to her that her job might</v>

252
00:15:25.611 --> 00:15:26.444
<v Speaker 1>be in jeopardy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The conduct of the defendants was </v>

253
00:15:29.391 --> 00:15:33.680
<v Speaker 1>objectively outrageous and flagrant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had reckless disregard for the fact</v>

254
00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:34.603
<v Speaker 1>that the foreseeable consequences of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their conduct would cause shepard to </v>

255
00:15:37.101 --> 00:15:39.770
<v Speaker 1>suffer emotional distress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which it did.</v>

256
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:41.623
<v Speaker 1>There are various policies of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>university which constitute a contract </v>

<v Speaker 1>None of this occurred.</v>

264
00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:18.403
<v Speaker 1>more appropriately dealt with elsewhere,</v>

<v Speaker 1>inhibit academic freedom.</v>

278
00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:20.173
<v Speaker 1>It was used by Ramboo Kana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joel and Pimlott for precisely that </v>

00:17:23.031 --> 00:17:23.864
<v Speaker 1>purpose.</v>

283
00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:40.813
<v Speaker 1>maliciously and in bad faith and it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimately determined by the university </v>

284
00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:46.520
<v Speaker 1>that this meeting never should have </v>
<v Speaker 1>occurred.</v>

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:50.250
<v Speaker 1>No action has been taken by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>university against them and shepherd was</v>

286
00:17:50.251 --> 00:17:53.160
<v Speaker 1>provided no protection from their </v>

00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:54.323
<v Speaker 1>and or offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A poisoned environment can arise even </v>

303
00:18:57.781 --> 00:18:58.614
<v Speaker 1>from a single incident.</v>

305
00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:08.370
<v Speaker 1>Ramboo Bukana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pimlott and Joel created a poisoned work</v>

306
00:19:08.371 --> 00:19:09.204
<v Speaker 1>environment for shepherd and thereby </v>
<v Speaker 1>breached the university's contractual </v>

307
00:19:11.701 --> 00:19:12.930
<v Speaker 1>obligations to shepherd.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Article Four Point Oh four states that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the university will take appropriate </v>

309
00:19:18.601 --> 00:19:22.380
<v Speaker 1>steps to fairly investigate,</v>

311
00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:29.850
<v Speaker 1>No such steps were taken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

312
00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:30.713
<v Speaker 1>shepherd was wrongly attacked by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>members of the administration until </v>

313
00:19:33.331 --> 00:19:37.770
<v Speaker 1>public and alumni outcry forced the </v>
<v Speaker 1>university to retreat from its position.</v>

314
00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:43.880
<v Speaker 1>Following this meeting being publicized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mcclachi president of the university was</v>

315
00:19:43.891 --> 00:19:46.170
<v Speaker 1>interviewed on the agenda by Steve </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pakan,</v>

316
00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:47.153
<v Speaker 1>the same show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from which the clip of the debate </v>

317
00:19:48.691 --> 00:19:49.524
<v Speaker 1>between Dr. Peterson and Matt was taken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was repeatedly asked by Pakan </v>

318
00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:54.533
<v Speaker 1>whether Shepard had done anything wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>by showing this clip from his earlier </v>

319
00:19:57.901 --> 00:19:58.734
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mcclatchy effectively defended the </v>

320
00:20:00.751 --> 00:20:02.940
<v Speaker 1>conduct of Ramboo County,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joel and Pimlott.</v>

321
00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:07.320
<v Speaker 1>She refused to acknowledge the shepherd </v>
<v Speaker 1>had not acted improperly,</v>

322
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:08.183
<v Speaker 1>despite pagans continuing to press her </v>
<v Speaker 1>on this shepherd had the foresight to </v>

323
00:20:12.031 --> 00:20:15.990
<v Speaker 1>taper inquisition when it began and </v>
<v Speaker 1>after outrage from the public and alumni</v>

324
00:20:15.991 --> 00:20:16.770
<v Speaker 1>erupted.</v>

325
00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:20.400
<v Speaker 1>The president of the university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Debra mcclachi and Ramboo.</v>

326
00:20:20.401 --> 00:20:24.300
<v Speaker 1>Kenna issued apologies in Ramboo Kennis </v>
<v Speaker 1>forced apology.</v>

327
00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:25.193
<v Speaker 1>He continued to lie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>still insisting that there had been a </v>

328
00:20:27.541 --> 00:20:30.900
<v Speaker 1>complaint and that he had been doing his</v>
<v Speaker 1>duty by addressing it.</v>

329
00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:32.303
<v Speaker 1>It was only when public and alumni </v>
<v Speaker 1>outrage group that mcclachi was </v>

330
00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:36.683
<v Speaker 1>ultimately forced to admit that what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened to Ms. Shepherd in the meeting </v>

331
00:20:39.841 --> 00:20:43.650
<v Speaker 1>was shameful and that the material she </v>
<v Speaker 1>showed was entirely appropriate.</v>

332
00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:44.723
<v Speaker 1>That was a quote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was only after an investigator </v>

333
00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:49.270
<v Speaker 1>found that there never had been any </v>
<v Speaker 1>complaints,</v>

334
00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:51.910
<v Speaker 1>formal or informal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that Ramboo Kinda Pim.</v>

335
00:20:51.911 --> 00:20:54.010
<v Speaker 1>Lots and Joel statements to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>contrary.</v>

336
00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:54.933
<v Speaker 1>We're false and deceitful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The university admitted in this </v>

337
00:20:57.701 --> 00:20:58.534
<v Speaker 1>statement from its president that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>meeting never should have happened at </v>

338
00:21:00.821 --> 00:21:03.070
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No formal complaint,</v>

339
00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:08.160
<v Speaker 1>nor even an informal concern relative to</v>
<v Speaker 1>university policy had been registered as</v>

340
00:21:08.861 --> 00:21:10.150
<v Speaker 1>to the screening of the video.</v>

341
00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:11.673
<v Speaker 1>The president only when besieged </v>
<v Speaker 1>acknowledged that these errors and </v>

342
00:21:14.261 --> 00:21:15.094
<v Speaker 1>judgment were compounded by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>misapplication of the university's </v>

343
00:21:18.071 --> 00:21:21.610
<v Speaker 1>policies and procedures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that basic guidelines and best practices</v>

344
00:21:21.611 --> 00:21:22.444
<v Speaker 1>on how to appropriately execute the </v>
<v Speaker 1>roles and responsibilities of staff and </v>

345
00:21:25.271 --> 00:21:26.104
<v Speaker 1>faculty were ignored or not understood </v>
<v Speaker 1>that procedures on how to apply </v>

346
00:21:29.321 --> 00:21:33.470
<v Speaker 1>university policies and under what </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances were not followed and that</v>

347
00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:36.100
<v Speaker 1>institutional failure allowed this to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

348
00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:40.600
<v Speaker 1>The president noted that as there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>institutional failure,</v>

349
00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:44.350
<v Speaker 1>the responsibility ultimately started </v>
<v Speaker 1>and ended with her.</v>

350
00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:45.483
<v Speaker 1>She further acknowledged that Ms. </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sheppard was targeted with vitriol by </v>

351
00:21:49.481 --> 00:21:50.314
<v Speaker 1>members of the university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mcclatchy admitted that shepherd was </v>

352
00:21:53.021 --> 00:21:53.854
<v Speaker 1>involved in absolutely no wrongdoing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>publicly stated that the university was </v>

353
00:21:58.241 --> 00:22:01.300
<v Speaker 1>taking action to ensure that this did </v>
<v Speaker 1>not occur again,</v>

354
00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:05.740
<v Speaker 1>a claim that was and remains entirely </v>
<v Speaker 1>false.</v>

355
00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:08.440
<v Speaker 1>Shepherd has never received redress of </v>
<v Speaker 1>any kind,</v>

356
00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:12.400
<v Speaker 1>nor has she been consulted about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>input that this treatment has had on her</v>

357
00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:13.840
<v Speaker 1>and her career prospects.</v>

358
00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:14.943
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was subjected to continuing abuse </v>

359
00:22:17.711 --> 00:22:18.544
<v Speaker 1>and it talks at climate from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>university and its representatives as </v>

360
00:22:21.161 --> 00:22:26.161
<v Speaker 1>described below</v>
<v Speaker 1>in mcclatchy's apology on November 21st,</v>

361
00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:28.173
<v Speaker 1>2017 she states that quote supports were</v>
<v Speaker 1>in place to support student involvement </v>

362
00:22:31.841 --> 00:22:32.674
<v Speaker 1>in a situation who are targeted with </v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme vitriol through the situation </v>

363
00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:36.903
<v Speaker 1>and quote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yet she and the university offered </v>

364
00:22:38.801 --> 00:22:42.940
<v Speaker 1>shepherd no such support in mcclachi </v>
<v Speaker 1>claiming to be troubled.</v>

365
00:22:42.941 --> 00:22:45.830
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote everyone and quote involved in the</v>

366
00:22:45.831 --> 00:22:48.340
<v Speaker 1>situation was targeted with extreme </v>
<v Speaker 1>vitriol.</v>

367
00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:52.270
<v Speaker 1>She showed the same and equal concern </v>
<v Speaker 1>for shepherds predators.</v>

368
00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:56.500
<v Speaker 1>As for Shepard herself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The president also acknowledged that the</v>

369
00:22:56.501 --> 00:23:01.000
<v Speaker 1>rationale for invoking the gender and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual violence policy did not exist,</v>

370
00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:04.840
<v Speaker 1>that it was misapplied and that this was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a significant overreach.</v>

371
00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:06.243
<v Speaker 1>Shepherd relies on mcclatchy's </v>
<v Speaker 1>admissions here in mcclachi claim that </v>

372
00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:11.673
<v Speaker 1>quote Lauria is committed to the abiding</v>
<v Speaker 1>principles of freedom of speech and </v>

373
00:23:14.771 --> 00:23:18.930
<v Speaker 1>freedom of expression and quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her conduct throughout entirely betrayed</v>

374
00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:23.940
<v Speaker 1>that goal in Ramboo Canis disingenuous </v>
<v Speaker 1>apology to Shepard on November 21st,</v>

375
00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:27.370
<v Speaker 1>2017 he stated open quote.</v>

376
00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:28.413
<v Speaker 1>While I still cannot discuss the student</v>
<v Speaker 1>concerns raised about the tutorial and </v>

377
00:23:32.711 --> 00:23:33.544
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no student concern had even been </v>

378
00:23:35.831 --> 00:23:36.664
<v Speaker 1>raised about the tutorial prior to his </v>
<v Speaker 1>and his codefendants bullying of </v>

379
00:23:39.671 --> 00:23:40.504
<v Speaker 1>shepherd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He acknowledged that his meeting with a </v>

380
00:23:42.161 --> 00:23:42.994
<v Speaker 1>panel of three people would be an </v>
<v Speaker 1>intimidating for shepherd and would not </v>

381
00:23:46.731 --> 00:23:50.120
<v Speaker 1>have invited a productive discussion </v>
<v Speaker 1>ramboo can.</v>

382
00:23:50.121 --> 00:23:50.954
<v Speaker 1>His apology claimed that he quote did </v>
<v Speaker 1>not do enough to try to support her </v>

383
00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:58.460
<v Speaker 1>shepherd and quote when he did </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely nothing at all,</v>

384
00:23:58.490 --> 00:23:59.323
<v Speaker 1>but instead attacked her following the </v>
<v Speaker 1>public outcry the next time shepard met </v>

385
00:24:03.501 --> 00:24:04.334
<v Speaker 1>with her students,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chair of the Department of </v>

386
00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:09.110
<v Speaker 1>Communications.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peter Erkhart attended that tutorial and</v>

387
00:24:09.111 --> 00:24:09.944
<v Speaker 1>offered shepard students but not </v>
<v Speaker 1>shepherd emotional support suggesting </v>

388
00:24:14.061 --> 00:24:17.240
<v Speaker 1>that they would be welcome to go to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>campus wellness center.</v>

389
00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:20.630
<v Speaker 1>He sat at the back of the room for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire tutorial,</v>

390
00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:21.553
<v Speaker 1>effectively shutting down any discussion</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the issue and undermining shepherd's </v>

391
00:24:24.711 --> 00:24:26.030
<v Speaker 1>role in her classroom.</v>

392
00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:28.063
<v Speaker 1>Erkhart proceeded on behalf of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>university to publicly insult shepherd </v>

393
00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:35.840
<v Speaker 1>when asked by email,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by Maclean's magazine why he appeared in</v>

394
00:24:35.841 --> 00:24:37.910
<v Speaker 1>her class on that day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He responded,</v>

395
00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:40.550
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I assume she recorded it.</v>

396
00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:44.090
<v Speaker 1>Why not ask her for the recording and </v>
<v Speaker 1>quote.</v>

397
00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:47.540
<v Speaker 1>He then sent maclean's a second email.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Open quote,</v>

398
00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:48.830
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a pro.</v>

399
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:49.783
<v Speaker 1>I should have assumed that you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>already heard that particular recording </v>

400
00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:53.173
<v Speaker 1>and quote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Using his position of power and </v>

401
00:24:54.531 --> 00:24:58.340
<v Speaker 1>authority over shepherd to intimidate </v>
<v Speaker 1>and embarrass her publicly.</v>

402
00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:04.040
<v Speaker 1>Professor Elisia Slowinski,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who shepherd was taking a masters course</v>

403
00:25:04.041 --> 00:25:04.874
<v Speaker 1>from asked in front of the class for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Shepard to put away her laptop and then </v>

404
00:25:08.721 --> 00:25:09.554
<v Speaker 1>said in front of other master's students</v>
<v Speaker 1>that she gave this instruction because </v>

405
00:25:12.561 --> 00:25:13.394
<v Speaker 1>she did not want to be recorded even </v>
<v Speaker 1>when shepard assured her that she was </v>

406
00:25:16.701 --> 00:25:17.534
<v Speaker 1>not recording the class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Further alienating and creating a toxic </v>

407
00:25:20.421 --> 00:25:21.620
<v Speaker 1>environment for shepherd.</v>

408
00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:23.533
<v Speaker 1>Following these events,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ramboo Canis course ended and shepherd </v>

409
00:25:26.631 --> 00:25:30.290
<v Speaker 1>was assigned to be the teaching </v>
<v Speaker 1>assistant to Professor Judith Nicholson,</v>

410
00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:31.273
<v Speaker 1>a professor of communication who had </v>
<v Speaker 1>publicly taken a negative position </v>

411
00:25:34.491 --> 00:25:37.550
<v Speaker 1>against shepherd prior to shepard being </v>
<v Speaker 1>assigned to her.</v>

412
00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:39.193
<v Speaker 1>Before that semester even started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nicholson had signed an open letter </v>

413
00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:45.140
<v Speaker 1>supporting Pimlott and Ramboo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kenna.</v>

414
00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:48.820
<v Speaker 1>This made the university assigning </v>
<v Speaker 1>shepard to her tutor.</v>

415
00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:49.673
<v Speaker 1>Lich entirely inappropriate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>created a poisoned environment for </v>

416
00:25:52.371 --> 00:25:55.130
<v Speaker 1>shepherd and made it impossible for her </v>
<v Speaker 1>to succeed.</v>

417
00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:56.653
<v Speaker 1>Shepherds apprehensions about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nicholson's lack of objectivity toward </v>

418
00:25:59.301 --> 00:26:00.134
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're quickly born out on three </v>

419
00:26:02.151 --> 00:26:04.940
<v Speaker 1>occasions during their relatively brief </v>
<v Speaker 1>dealings,</v>

420
00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:05.893
<v Speaker 1>Nicholson without provocation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>harassed and abused shepherd and </v>

421
00:26:08.721 --> 00:26:12.890
<v Speaker 1>deliberately create a difficulty for her</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the outset of their meeting,</v>

422
00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:15.950
<v Speaker 1>Nicholson told shepherd that it was her </v>
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>

423
00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:16.873
<v Speaker 1>academic freedom and quote and that no </v>
<v Speaker 1>one is permitted to make the university </v>

424
00:26:20.211 --> 00:26:21.044
<v Speaker 1>look bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>implying that shepherd had improperly </v>

425
00:26:23.151 --> 00:26:23.420
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

426
00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:25.730
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the second occasion,</v>

427
00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:29.120
<v Speaker 1>she sent out a course syllabus with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>territorial acknowledgement,</v>

428
00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:29.961
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>E.</v>

429
00:26:29.961 --> 00:26:33.260
<v Speaker 1>A reference to the aboriginal tribe </v>
<v Speaker 1>which had once been on the land,</v>

430
00:26:33.261 --> 00:26:34.094
<v Speaker 1>which Wilford Lauria was on shepherd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Considering this irrelevant to the </v>

431
00:26:38.001 --> 00:26:38.834
<v Speaker 1>syllabus and a ludicrous act of </v>
<v Speaker 1>political correctness and virtue </v>

432
00:26:41.781 --> 00:26:42.614
<v Speaker 1>signaling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cut that part of the note and tweeted </v>

433
00:26:44.671 --> 00:26:45.504
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>noting that such acknowledgements were </v>

434
00:26:46.591 --> 00:26:49.170
<v Speaker 1>now even on the syllabus of university </v>
<v Speaker 1>courses,</v>

435
00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:50.453
<v Speaker 1>Nicholson demanded in front of the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>teaching assistants that she delete her </v>

436
00:26:53.401 --> 00:26:54.234
<v Speaker 1>tweet when shepard protested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that all she was tweeting was the </v>

437
00:26:57.181 --> 00:27:00.510
<v Speaker 1>university logo with the course name and</v>
<v Speaker 1>territorial acknowledgement.</v>

438
00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:04.260
<v Speaker 1>Nicholson threatened to take her to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dean if she did not remove it.</v>

439
00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:08.910
<v Speaker 1>Nicholson also absurdly claimed that </v>
<v Speaker 1>this territorial acknowledgement was her</v>

440
00:27:08.911 --> 00:27:09.744
<v Speaker 1>intellectual property.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She proceeded to complain to the Dean </v>

441
00:27:12.421 --> 00:27:13.254
<v Speaker 1>about Shepherd's tweet in an attempt to </v>
<v Speaker 1>further endanger shepherds position in </v>

442
00:27:16.681 --> 00:27:17.514
<v Speaker 1>the university.</v>

443
00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:22.170
<v Speaker 1>The Dean informed Nicholson that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>acknowledgement was not her intellectual</v>

444
00:27:22.171 --> 00:27:23.004
<v Speaker 1>property and called an urgent meeting </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the two departments which shepherd </v>

445
00:27:26.551 --> 00:27:27.384
<v Speaker 1>was associated with the communication </v>
<v Speaker 1>studies and the cultural analysis and </v>

446
00:27:30.511 --> 00:27:34.170
<v Speaker 1>social theory departments at least in </v>
<v Speaker 1>part to discuss these issues.</v>

447
00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:35.483
<v Speaker 1>It was clear that if shepherd had </v>
<v Speaker 1>tweeted positively about the land </v>

448
00:27:38.041 --> 00:27:41.160
<v Speaker 1>acknowledgement she would not have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>in difficulty with Nicholson.</v>

449
00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:43.073
<v Speaker 1>The third occasion was in March,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2018 when shepard needed to reschedule </v>

450
00:27:46.411 --> 00:27:47.244
<v Speaker 1>her last class of the year and utilize </v>
<v Speaker 1>polling software with a link to </v>

451
00:27:50.161 --> 00:27:50.994
<v Speaker 1>available alternate days for her class </v>
<v Speaker 1>to fill out their available alternate </v>

452
00:27:54.241 --> 00:27:57.270
<v Speaker 1>dates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When Shepard found times that all of her</v>

453
00:27:57.271 --> 00:27:58.104
<v Speaker 1>students were available to meet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she emailed Nicholson to seek her </v>

454
00:28:00.721 --> 00:28:01.554
<v Speaker 1>approval for the new dates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nicholson reprimanded her copying two </v>

455
00:28:05.551 --> 00:28:06.384
<v Speaker 1>deans claiming falsely that shepherd had</v>
<v Speaker 1>moved these classes without Nicholson's </v>

456
00:28:09.691 --> 00:28:10.524
<v Speaker 1>consent in advance even though the </v>
<v Speaker 1>letter was just such a request and the </v>

457
00:28:14.041 --> 00:28:17.370
<v Speaker 1>request on its face was premised on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nicholson's consent.</v>

458
00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:18.863
<v Speaker 1>When Shepard advised Nicholson that she </v>
<v Speaker 1>never had any intention of changing the </v>

459
00:28:21.721 --> 00:28:22.554
<v Speaker 1>date without Nicholson's approval,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was why her letter explicitly </v>

460
00:28:25.471 --> 00:28:26.304
<v Speaker 1>requested that approval.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nicholson counseled shepherds tutorial </v>

461
00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:32.250
<v Speaker 1>entirely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was despite the fact that alternate</v>

462
00:28:32.251 --> 00:28:35.040
<v Speaker 1>dates were available for Shepard and our</v>
<v Speaker 1>students to attend.</v>

463
00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:36.323
<v Speaker 1>Nicholson instructed shepard students to</v>
<v Speaker 1>attend sessions of the other teaching </v>

464
00:28:39.481 --> 00:28:40.314
<v Speaker 1>assistants on dates which were largely </v>
<v Speaker 1>coincident with dates which shepard and </v>

465
00:28:43.711 --> 00:28:44.544
<v Speaker 1>her students had arranged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since this was to have been shepherds </v>

466
00:28:47.071 --> 00:28:49.890
<v Speaker 1>last class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she never saw her students again.</v>

467
00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:51.863
<v Speaker 1>Ethan Jackson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a transgender activist who has attacked </v>

468
00:28:54.901 --> 00:28:57.330
<v Speaker 1>shepard throughout the events described </v>
<v Speaker 1>herein,</v>

469
00:28:57.630 --> 00:28:58.463
<v Speaker 1>launched a formal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>patently frivolous harassment complaint </v>

470
00:29:01.531 --> 00:29:06.150
<v Speaker 1>against her to which even after Ms. </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sheppard had completed her coursework at</v>

471
00:29:06.151 --> 00:29:09.000
<v Speaker 1>the university so she would not see </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jackson again.</v>

472
00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:13.560
<v Speaker 1>The university responded by proceeding </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a formal investigation.</v>

473
00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:14.573
<v Speaker 1>Despite its inherently vexatious bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>faith and frivolous allegations which </v>

474
00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:19.973
<v Speaker 1>pursuant to the applicable policies the </v>
<v Speaker 1>university should not have proceeded </v>

475
00:29:23.851 --> 00:29:24.684
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

476
00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:30.260
<v Speaker 1>Jackson had an online crowd funding page</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeking a sex change operation,</v>

477
00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:34.050
<v Speaker 1>which was initially denied because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>his mental health issues.</v>

478
00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:35.273
<v Speaker 1>Additionally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jackson was banned from the University </v>

479
00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:41.950
<v Speaker 1>of Waterloo campus in 2013 for </v>
<v Speaker 1>protesting and d platforming,</v>

480
00:29:41.951 --> 00:29:42.784
<v Speaker 1>a member of parliament who was to give a</v>
<v Speaker 1>speech on abortion by dressing up as a </v>

481
00:29:46.391 --> 00:29:47.224
<v Speaker 1>giant vulva and yelling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jackson was invariably hostile to </v>

482
00:29:51.251 --> 00:29:56.251
<v Speaker 1>shepherd Jackson's allegations against </v>
<v Speaker 1>shepherd where that a,</v>

483
00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:57.543
<v Speaker 1>she was on her telephone during one </v>
<v Speaker 1>class and purportedly disengaged from </v>

484
00:30:00.401 --> 00:30:03.190
<v Speaker 1>participation in that class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>B,</v>

485
00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:08.340
<v Speaker 1>Ms. Sheppard had made four tweets with </v>
<v Speaker 1>screenshots from Jackson's controversial</v>

486
00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:09.363
<v Speaker 1>social media account.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sea Shepherd responded to Jackson </v>

487
00:30:13.511 --> 00:30:14.344
<v Speaker 1>walking into the printing room and </v>
<v Speaker 1>angrily ordering her to leave the room </v>

488
00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:20.320
<v Speaker 1>and cease using the communications </v>
<v Speaker 1>department printer,</v>

489
00:30:20.410 --> 00:30:21.243
<v Speaker 1>which she required for communications </v>
<v Speaker 1>coursework by referring to him as petty </v>

490
00:30:25.091 --> 00:30:25.924
<v Speaker 1>and pathetic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>D when Shepard and two others were </v>

491
00:30:28.721 --> 00:30:32.380
<v Speaker 1>putting up posters for a lorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a society for open inquiry meeting.</v>

492
00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:33.393
<v Speaker 1>He claimed that they had followed him </v>
<v Speaker 1>and his colleague as they were walking </v>

493
00:30:36.101 --> 00:30:36.934
<v Speaker 1>around the halls and that shepherds </v>
<v Speaker 1>posters had signage which he found </v>

494
00:30:39.671 --> 00:30:40.504
<v Speaker 1>offensive posters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which he acknowledges removing from the </v>

495
00:30:42.911 --> 00:30:43.744
<v Speaker 1>walls without authorization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The complaint of Jackson was made </v>

496
00:30:48.071 --> 00:30:48.904
<v Speaker 1>maliciously after classes were over for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the year at a time when he and shepard </v>

497
00:30:52.211 --> 00:30:53.044
<v Speaker 1>would not ever be interacting again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since shepherd is not enrolled in a </v>

498
00:30:56.261 --> 00:30:57.094
<v Speaker 1>courses for the following session,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite Jackson's complaint being </v>

499
00:31:00.671 --> 00:31:03.010
<v Speaker 1>inherently self contradictory and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ludicrous,</v>

500
00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:07.030
<v Speaker 1>the university not only proceeded to </v>
<v Speaker 1>summon Shepard for an investigation,</v>

501
00:31:07.210 --> 00:31:08.043
<v Speaker 1>but threatened her with repercussions if</v>
<v Speaker 1>she disclosed Jackson's complaint to </v>

502
00:31:11.351 --> 00:31:12.184
<v Speaker 1>anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The attacks on shepherd have rendered </v>

503
00:31:14.561 --> 00:31:18.340
<v Speaker 1>her unemployable in academia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>resulting in her abandoning her previous</v>

504
00:31:18.341 --> 00:31:19.174
<v Speaker 1>ambitions of obtaining her phd or even </v>
<v Speaker 1>teaching at a university as a masters </v>

505
00:31:22.811 --> 00:31:26.680
<v Speaker 1>graduate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shepherd has suffered nervous shock as a</v>

506
00:31:26.681 --> 00:31:27.514
<v Speaker 1>result of the conduct of the defendants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was the foreseeable and intended </v>

507
00:31:30.701 --> 00:31:31.534
<v Speaker 1>result.</v>

508
00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:32.673
<v Speaker 1>In the alternative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the reasonably foreseeable </v>

509
00:31:34.841 --> 00:31:35.674
<v Speaker 1>outcome of their conduct and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>defendants were negligent in their </v>

510
00:31:38.531 --> 00:31:39.430
<v Speaker 1>treatment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of Her.</v>

511
00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:43.980
<v Speaker 1>So that's shepherds claim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As I said,</v>

512
00:31:43.981 --> 00:31:47.550
<v Speaker 1>after I reviewed this and talked in </v>
<v Speaker 1>detail to shepherds lawyer,</v>

513
00:31:47.730 --> 00:31:48.563
<v Speaker 1>I concluded that Wilfred Laurier had not</v>
<v Speaker 1>learned what needed to be learned and </v>

514
00:31:51.571 --> 00:31:55.470
<v Speaker 1>launched a claim of my own this week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It reads in part</v>

515
00:31:57.090 --> 00:32:00.390
<v Speaker 1>the plaintiff that's me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>claims against the defendants,</v>

516
00:32:00.391 --> 00:32:03.060
<v Speaker 1>Nathan Ramboo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canna Herbert Pimlott Atria,</v>

517
00:32:03.061 --> 00:32:08.061
<v Speaker 1>Joel and Wilfrid laurier university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the following 500,000 for defamation,</v>

518
00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:13.940
<v Speaker 1>500,000 for injurious false hood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>500,000 in punitive damages,</v>

519
00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:18.690
<v Speaker 1>prejudgment and post judgement interest </v>
<v Speaker 1>in accordance with the courts of Justice</v>

520
00:32:18.690 --> 00:32:22.230
<v Speaker 1>Act costs on a substantial indemnity </v>
<v Speaker 1>basis and such.</v>

521
00:32:22.231 --> 00:32:26.490
<v Speaker 1>Further and other relief as counsel may </v>
<v Speaker 1>advise and this honorable court may deem</v>

522
00:32:26.491 --> 00:32:29.640
<v Speaker 1>just the plaintiff's claim against </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ramboo,</v>

523
00:32:29.641 --> 00:32:30.474
<v Speaker 1>Canna Pimlott Joel and the university </v>
<v Speaker 1>defamatory statements on Youtube on or </v>

524
00:32:35.311 --> 00:32:36.144
<v Speaker 1>about November 2nd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2017 Rambo Kana his then teaching </v>

525
00:32:40.191 --> 00:32:41.024
<v Speaker 1>assistant Lindsay Shepherd to attend </v>
<v Speaker 1>what turned out to be a disciplinary </v>

526
00:32:44.061 --> 00:32:44.894
<v Speaker 1>meeting with himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pimlott and Joel to discuss her having </v>

527
00:32:47.601 --> 00:32:51.110
<v Speaker 1>shown an extract from a TV Ontario </v>
<v Speaker 1>program to our students.</v>

528
00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:52.063
<v Speaker 1>The TV Ontario program moderated by </v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve Pagan consisted of a debate </v>

529
00:32:55.611 --> 00:33:00.611
<v Speaker 1>between Peterson and Nicholas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matt at the meeting on or about November</v>

530
00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:02.113
<v Speaker 1>2nd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2017 Rambo Kana Pim lot and Joel each </v>

531
00:33:03.141 --> 00:33:05.840
<v Speaker 1>made numerous defamatory statements </v>
<v Speaker 1>about Peterson,</v>

532
00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:09.650
<v Speaker 1>all of which the others endorsed both </v>
<v Speaker 1>expressedly and implied.</v>

533
00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:11.323
<v Speaker 1>The meetings content has since been </v>
<v Speaker 1>posted online on a video sharing </v>

534
00:33:14.391 --> 00:33:17.150
<v Speaker 1>website,</v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube and is available on the Internet</v>

535
00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:18.043
<v Speaker 1>where it is open to the public and </v>
<v Speaker 1>easily accessible by anyone who wishes </v>

536
00:33:20.691 --> 00:33:21.524
<v Speaker 1>to view its content.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm skipping a bit here at the meeting </v>

537
00:33:24.411 --> 00:33:25.244
<v Speaker 1>on or about November 2nd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2017 Rambo cannot Pimlott and Joel </v>

538
00:33:28.911 --> 00:33:29.744
<v Speaker 1>falsely and maliciously made numerous </v>
<v Speaker 1>defamatory statements about Peterson </v>

539
00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:33.703
<v Speaker 1>including but not limited to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>following defamatory statements made by </v>

540
00:33:38.151 --> 00:33:42.440
<v Speaker 1>Ramboo Canna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Peterson identified student protestors</v>

541
00:33:42.441 --> 00:33:46.250
<v Speaker 1>by posting their social media accounts </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the purpose of other people bullying</v>

542
00:33:46.251 --> 00:33:50.690
<v Speaker 1>and threatening them online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>B Peterson is basically debating whether</v>

543
00:33:50.691 --> 00:33:53.000
<v Speaker 1>or not a trans student should have </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights.</v>

544
00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:54.133
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peterson's position would be the </v>

545
00:33:55.731 --> 00:33:56.564
<v Speaker 1>equivalent of debating whether or not a </v>
<v Speaker 1>student of color should have rights or </v>

546
00:33:58.851 --> 00:33:59.684
<v Speaker 1>should be allowed to be married.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Contrary to the charter of rights and </v>

547
00:34:02.121 --> 00:34:02.954
<v Speaker 1>freedoms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dee Peterson has engaged in the </v>

548
00:34:05.211 --> 00:34:06.044
<v Speaker 1>targeting of trans students,</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving out their personal information </v>

549
00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:11.960
<v Speaker 1>for the purpose of having them attack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>harassed so that death threats will find</v>

550
00:34:11.961 --> 00:34:13.880
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is something that Peterson has done</v>

551
00:34:13.881 --> 00:34:16.910
<v Speaker 1>to his own students,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peterson has done to other students.</v>

552
00:34:17.450 --> 00:34:18.283
<v Speaker 1>He playing a speech by Peterson is </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically like playing a speech by </v>

553
00:34:21.951 --> 00:34:22.784
<v Speaker 1>Hitler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>F Peterson's opinion is like alt-right </v>

554
00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:28.790
<v Speaker 1>opinions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>white supremacist opinions,</v>

555
00:34:28.850 --> 00:34:31.250
<v Speaker 1>Anti Trans Opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anti gay opinion,</v>

556
00:34:31.370 --> 00:34:33.590
<v Speaker 1>anti woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>misogynist opinion.</v>

557
00:34:33.890 --> 00:34:37.970
<v Speaker 1>G Peterson's view is whether trans </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are people or not.</v>

558
00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:39.343
<v Speaker 1>Defamatory statements made by Pimlott </v>
<v Speaker 1>Peterson is academically suspect to say </v>

559
00:34:43.911 --> 00:34:44.744
<v Speaker 1>the least.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He does not have the substantial </v>

560
00:34:45.981 --> 00:34:48.410
<v Speaker 1>academic evidence to be a credible </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

561
00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:51.650
<v Speaker 1>B,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peterson's positions don't have credible</v>

562
00:34:51.651 --> 00:34:55.610
<v Speaker 1>evidence just like Charles Murray with </v>
<v Speaker 1>his race claims of white superiority.</v>

563
00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:56.653
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peterson brings hatred and targets </v>

564
00:34:58.431 --> 00:34:59.264
<v Speaker 1>groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dee Peterson Exhibits Charlatan Ism II </v>

565
00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:07.250
<v Speaker 1>Peterson has nothing really that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>credible in terms of research defamatory</v>

566
00:35:07.251 --> 00:35:11.270
<v Speaker 1>statements made by Joel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Peterson's position is causing harm to</v>

567
00:35:11.271 --> 00:35:15.350
<v Speaker 1>trans students by framing their identity</v>
<v Speaker 1>as invalid or their pronouns as invalid.</v>

568
00:35:15.351 --> 00:35:17.390
<v Speaker 1>Contrary to the Ontario Human Rights </v>
<v Speaker 1>Code.</v>

569
00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:23.120
<v Speaker 1>B Peterson is spreading transphobia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm skipping ahead a bit.</v>

570
00:35:23.121 --> 00:35:23.954
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the said words in their natural and </v>

571
00:35:26.601 --> 00:35:27.434
<v Speaker 1>ordinary meaning and the connotation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the comments obvious to any reader were </v>

572
00:35:31.011 --> 00:35:36.011
<v Speaker 1>meant and were understood to mean that </v>

00:37:13.261 --> 00:37:14.094

<v Speaker 1>careless university professors and </v>

606
00:37:17.401 --> 00:37:18.234
<v Speaker 1>administrators blinded by their own </v>
