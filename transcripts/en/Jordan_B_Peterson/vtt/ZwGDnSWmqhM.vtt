1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:00.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.190
<v Speaker 2>When I had talked to people about doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>the future authoring program,</v>

3
00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:04.203
<v Speaker 2>they often put it off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's not surprising because it's </v>

4
00:00:05.921 --> 00:00:07.730
<v Speaker 2>hard and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and b,</v>

5
00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:08.980
<v Speaker 2>but it's more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think,</v>

6
00:00:08.981 --> 00:00:10.150
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how to write.</v>

7
00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:14.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do a bad job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really like assignments.</v>

8
00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have to do it perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to wait till I have enough time.</v>

9
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:19.773
<v Speaker 2>And like one of those is enough to stop </v>
<v Speaker 2>you cold and all five of them you're </v>

10
00:00:22.301 --> 00:00:24.550
<v Speaker 2>just done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I tell people,</v>

11
00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:25.623
<v Speaker 2>do it haphazardly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a tiny bit at a time and badly because </v>

12
00:00:31.781 --> 00:00:32.614
<v Speaker 2>you can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tell my students when they're doing </v>

13
00:00:34.451 --> 00:00:35.284
<v Speaker 2>their thesis master's thesis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>write a really bad first draft and then </v>

14
00:00:38.441 --> 00:00:39.274
<v Speaker 2>we have a little conversation about that</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they don't think I mean that </v>

15
00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.070
<v Speaker 2>because it sounds like a cliche in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>

16
00:00:45.071 --> 00:00:47.500
<v Speaker 2>It's not a cliche,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a cliche at all.</v>

17
00:00:47.501 --> 00:00:48.334
<v Speaker 2>It means</v>

18
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.090
<v Speaker 2>you're a terrible writer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

19
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.070
<v Speaker 2>but if someone put a gun to your head </v>
<v Speaker 2>and said,</v>

20
00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.960
<v Speaker 2>you have to have your a hundred page </v>
<v Speaker 2>thesis done by next Monday or I'll shoot</v>

21
00:00:59.961 --> 00:01:02.660
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I don't care how terrible it is.</v>

22
00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.780
<v Speaker 2>You would sit down and write it and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing is,</v>

23
00:01:05.781 --> 00:01:08.630
<v Speaker 2>then you have it right then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you have something and then you can</v>

24
00:01:08.631 --> 00:01:10.730
<v Speaker 2>fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can iterate and fix it.</v>

25
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.610
<v Speaker 2>That bad first draft.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the most valuable thing.</v>

26
00:01:13.611 --> 00:01:17.270
<v Speaker 2>And so that's what you need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need a bad first draft of yourself.</v>

27
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:18.733
<v Speaker 2>And there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an idea that young developed </v>

28
00:01:20.961 --> 00:01:23.480
<v Speaker 2>about the trickster and the gesture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the comedian,</v>

29
00:01:23.481 --> 00:01:24.314
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That the trickster is the precursor to </v>

30
00:01:26.001 --> 00:01:26.834
<v Speaker 2>the savior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's one of the things I learned </v>

31
00:01:28.191 --> 00:01:29.024
<v Speaker 2>from young that was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so unlikely you'd never think that </v>

32
00:01:31.731 --> 00:01:34.070
<v Speaker 2>it's so amazing that that might be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>case.</v>

33
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.320
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

34
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.470
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

35
00:01:36.471 --> 00:01:38.900
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the satirical in the erotic and the,</v>

36
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.050
<v Speaker 2>and the troublemaker that the comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fool,</v>

37
00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.470
<v Speaker 2>the fool is the precursor to the savior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

38
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.750
<v Speaker 2>Because you're a fool when you start </v>
<v Speaker 2>something new.</v>

39
00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:49.940
<v Speaker 2>And so if you're not willing to be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fool,</v>

40
00:01:49.941 --> 00:01:52.280
<v Speaker 2>then you'll never start anything new.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you never start anything new,</v>

41
00:01:52.281 --> 00:01:53.114
<v Speaker 2>then you won't develop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the willingness to be a fool is </v>

42
00:01:55.821 --> 00:01:59.150
<v Speaker 2>the precursor to transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the same as humility.</v>

43
00:01:59.151 --> 00:02:01.190
<v Speaker 2>And so if you're going to write your </v>
<v Speaker 2>destiny,</v>

44
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.113
<v Speaker 2>you can do a bad first job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to get smarter as you move </v>

45
00:02:04.851 --> 00:02:06.830
<v Speaker 2>forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing is that,</v>

46
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.290
<v Speaker 2>so something beckons to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what happens here.</v>

47
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.130
<v Speaker 2>Maybe the star that Japan wished on was </v>
<v Speaker 2>the wrong damn star,</v>

48
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.290
<v Speaker 2>but at least it was a star,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

49
00:02:15.291 --> 00:02:16.940
<v Speaker 2>At least it was in the sky.</v>

50
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.230
<v Speaker 2>At least it moved him forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you say in your life or something</v>

51
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.040
<v Speaker 2>grips you and fills you with interest </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you think,</v>

52
00:02:25.041 --> 00:02:25.970
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should I do that?</v>

53
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.910
<v Speaker 2>And the answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if not that,</v>

54
00:02:28.911 --> 00:02:32.720
<v Speaker 2>then something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if it's a mistake?</v>

55
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.690
<v Speaker 2>It's a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rest assured,</v>

56
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.180
<v Speaker 2>what do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to stumble around,</v>

57
00:02:38.181 --> 00:02:39.920
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what's going to happen is this,</v>

58
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.730
<v Speaker 2>you're going to move to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to not stay in stacy's.</v>

59
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.330
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to wander around in </v>
<v Speaker 2>circles.</v>

60
00:02:44.331 --> 00:02:46.160
<v Speaker 2>And I see people like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>

61
00:02:46.161 --> 00:02:48.110
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never knew what to do and now I'm 40</v>

62
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:50.810
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not so good.</v>

63
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.720
<v Speaker 2>That's not so good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you might say,</v>

64
00:02:53.721 --> 00:02:56.060
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there is literature to that suggests</v>

65
00:02:56.061 --> 00:02:56.894
<v Speaker 2>that people are a lot more unhappy when </v>
<v Speaker 2>they look back in their lives about the </v>

66
00:03:01.631 --> 00:03:02.464
<v Speaker 2>things they didn't do than they are </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the mistakes they made while they </v>

67
00:03:05.531 --> 00:03:06.520
<v Speaker 2>were doing things.</v>

68
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.590
<v Speaker 2>And so that's really worth thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about too,</v>

69
00:03:08.591 --> 00:03:09.424
<v Speaker 2>because there's redemptive mistakes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>a redemptive mistake would be a mistake </v>

70
00:03:13.631 --> 00:03:15.370
<v Speaker 2>that you make when you go out try to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

71
00:03:15.371 --> 00:03:16.204
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you actually,</v>

72
00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.931
<v Speaker 2>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

73
00:03:16.931 --> 00:03:17.764
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try and do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you're not good at it and you make </v>

74
00:03:19.661 --> 00:03:21.150
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like what?</v>

75
00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:22.043
<v Speaker 2>What's the consequence if you pay </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention is you're not quite so stupid </v>

76
00:03:24.701 --> 00:03:27.430
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing is you've been informed</v>

77
00:03:27.431 --> 00:03:29.440
<v Speaker 2>by your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the results of your errors.</v>

78
00:03:29.441 --> 00:03:32.030
<v Speaker 2>And so what happens is you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

79
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.920
<v Speaker 2>you follow the beacon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you follow the light and you're blind.</v>

80
00:03:35.921 --> 00:03:37.170
<v Speaker 2>So you don't know where the light is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

81
00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.480
<v Speaker 2>it's dimly apprehended only and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>afraid to follow it.</v>

82
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.290
<v Speaker 2>But you decided to take some stumbling </v>
<v Speaker 2>steps towards it.</v>

83
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.870
<v Speaker 2>And as you take stumbling steps towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

84
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.913
<v Speaker 2>you become illuminated and enlightened </v>
<v Speaker 2>and informed because of the nature of </v>

85
00:03:51.611 --> 00:03:52.444
<v Speaker 2>your experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you're pushing yourself beyond </v>

86
00:03:53.801 --> 00:03:54.634
<v Speaker 2>where you are and you're going into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>country that you have not yet been in </v>

87
00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:58.323
<v Speaker 2>and you learn something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what happens then is the star </v>

88
00:04:00.551 --> 00:04:01.384
<v Speaker 2>moves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you move 10 feet towards it and you </v>

89
00:04:03.431 --> 00:04:03.821
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

90
00:04:03.821 --> 00:04:05.380
<v Speaker 2>that's not right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get it right.</v>

91
00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.420
<v Speaker 2>It isn't there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually there.</v>

92
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:08.583
<v Speaker 2>And so then you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see it somewhere else and you shift </v>

93
00:04:10.391 --> 00:04:13.900
<v Speaker 2>yourself slightly and you move forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what happens is that</v>

94
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:21.450
<v Speaker 2>you continue as you change the thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that guides you forward moves,</v>

95
00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.430
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like God in the,</v>

96
00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:25.840
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the desert,</v>

97
00:04:25.841 --> 00:04:26.674
<v Speaker 2>in Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pillar of light that you're </v>

98
00:04:27.431 --> 00:04:28.810
<v Speaker 2>following,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's moving.</v>

99
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.780
<v Speaker 2>It's not a permanent thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You move towards it,</v>

100
00:04:31.781 --> 00:04:34.000
<v Speaker 2>it moves away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it guides you forward.</v>

101
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.350
<v Speaker 2>And so you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

102
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.820
<v Speaker 2>is what I'm aiming at paradise itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the answer to that is no,</v>

103
00:04:39.821 --> 00:04:40.654
<v Speaker 2>because what do you know you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't see paradise if it was </v>

104
00:04:43.091 --> 00:04:45.670
<v Speaker 2>right in front of you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you might get a glimmer of it.</v>

105
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.313
<v Speaker 2>And so you move towards it and you grow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the next time you open your </v>

106
00:04:50.951 --> 00:04:52.870
<v Speaker 2>eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see a little bit more clearly.</v>

107
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.690
<v Speaker 2>And that's what happens is that just </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens over and over,</v>

108
00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.250
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It keeps moving.</v>

109
00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.430
<v Speaker 2>And so you move like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the thing that's so cool is that all</v>

110
00:05:04.861 --> 00:05:05.694
<v Speaker 2>those zigs and zags you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and each of those zags is and Zags is a </v>

111
00:05:08.491 --> 00:05:10.200
<v Speaker 2>catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hit a wall,</v>

112
00:05:10.201 --> 00:05:12.570
<v Speaker 2>my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I had to die a little bit and I</v>

113
00:05:12.571 --> 00:05:15.480
<v Speaker 2>barely got back up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a phoenix transformation at each,</v>

114
00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.090
<v Speaker 2>at each turn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's painful.</v>

115
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.430
<v Speaker 2>But the thing is is that even though </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've,</v>

116
00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:24.450
<v Speaker 2>you've traveled 20 miles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say on that road,</v>

117
00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.670
<v Speaker 2>and you've only moved three miles </v>
<v Speaker 2>forward,</v>

118
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.510
<v Speaker 2>you've moved three miles forward instead</v>
<v Speaker 2>of falling backwards.</v>

119
00:05:30.511 --> 00:05:33.630
<v Speaker 2>Because that's the thing too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that if you stand still,</v>

120
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:38.040
<v Speaker 2>you fall backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You cannot stand still because the world</v>

121
00:05:38.041 --> 00:05:38.874
<v Speaker 2>moves away from you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you stand still and there's no </v>

122
00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.680
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's only backwards.</v>

123
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.680
<v Speaker 2>And so if you're not moving backward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back forwards,</v>

124
00:05:46.681 --> 00:05:49.780
<v Speaker 2>then you're moving backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's more,</v>

125
00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.690
<v Speaker 2>more of the underlying truth of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the matthew principle,</v>

126
00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:59.820
<v Speaker 2>to those who have everything more will </v>
<v Speaker 2>be given from those who have nothing.</v>

127
00:05:59.821 --> 00:06:02.730
<v Speaker 2>Everything will be taken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a warning.</v>

128
00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:08.090
<v Speaker 2>Do not stay in one place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

129
00:06:08.601 --> 00:06:10.090
<v Speaker 2>as you zig and zag,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe the,</v>

130
00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:15.620
<v Speaker 2>maybe the cataclysm of each </v>
<v Speaker 2>transformation starts to lessen.</v>

131
00:06:15.621 --> 00:06:18.860
<v Speaker 2>There's not so much of you that has to </v>
<v Speaker 2>die with every mistake</v>

132
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:24.470
<v Speaker 2>and maybe you end up oriented at least </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasonably properly.</v>

133
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.530
<v Speaker 2>And if you were sensible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would have been your trip,</v>

134
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.060
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that,</v>

135
00:06:29.061 --> 00:06:30.550
<v Speaker 2>and perhaps it's a lot worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did Not.</v>

136
00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.930
<v Speaker 2>Perhaps there's no shortage of </v>
<v Speaker 2>backtracking,</v>

137
00:06:32.931 --> 00:06:35.840
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't matter because as you </v>
<v Speaker 2>stumbled forward,</v>

138
00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:39.440
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you eliminate and inform yourself.</v>

139
00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:40.483
<v Speaker 2>And perhaps that's partly because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world is made of information and if you </v>

140
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.943
<v Speaker 2>encounter it and tangle with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it informs you and then you become </v>

141
00:06:49.551 --> 00:06:53.150
<v Speaker 2>informed and then you're in formation </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you're ready.</v>
