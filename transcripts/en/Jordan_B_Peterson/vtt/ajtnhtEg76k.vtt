1
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.000
<v Speaker 1>I talked a little bit last time about </v>
<v Speaker 1>what we were going to cover,</v>

2
00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:08.460
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't get quite through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to finish that.</v>

3
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.650
<v Speaker 1>For those of you who weren't here last </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

4
00:00:10.651 --> 00:00:12.450
<v Speaker 1>you can watch the lecture because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>online.</v>

5
00:00:12.451 --> 00:00:13.710
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

6
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.090
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we stopped at the depths.</v>

7
00:00:16.091 --> 00:00:16.924
<v Speaker 1>Psychologists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really those are the psychoanalysts and </v>

8
00:00:18.681 --> 00:00:22.590
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalysts are people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned with,</v>

9
00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:24.760
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

10
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.550
<v Speaker 1>well for a psychoanalyst,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

11
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.700
<v Speaker 1>you're a collection of loosely </v>
<v Speaker 1>integrated spirits.</v>

12
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.680
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or sub personalities.</v>

13
00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:34.623
<v Speaker 1>You're not a unity and no sub </v>
<v Speaker 1>personalities have their basis in while </v>

14
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.620
<v Speaker 1>in all sorts of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might have their basis in past,</v>

15
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:42.513
<v Speaker 1>especially traumatic experience or in </v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns of socialization that </v>

16
00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:47.493
<v Speaker 1>characterized your family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they might also have their basis in </v>

17
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.810
<v Speaker 1>fundamental biological motivational </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems.</v>

18
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.020
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a psychoanalyst would conceptualize it,</v>

19
00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.003
<v Speaker 1>anger or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or perhaps sexual attraction as a sub </v>

20
00:01:00.751 --> 00:01:03.310
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that,</v>

21
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.473
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what it's like when you get </v>

22
00:01:04.871 --> 00:01:05.704
<v Speaker 1>angry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get angry at someone you love and </v>

23
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

24
00:01:09.701 --> 00:01:10.534
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

25
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:11.803
<v Speaker 1>it's some level you're wishing harm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that might only be that you want to </v>

26
00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:17.620
<v Speaker 1>win the argument and you want them to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>nicely crushed while you do it.</v>

27
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:18.663
<v Speaker 1>But so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's a desire that comes along </v>

28
00:01:20.351 --> 00:01:21.184
<v Speaker 1>with the anger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

29
00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.050
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of other things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen to,</v>

30
00:01:23.051 --> 00:01:25.570
<v Speaker 1>so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone's annoying you,</v>

31
00:01:25.571 --> 00:01:26.404
<v Speaker 1>even if you love them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the profitability that at that moment </v>

32
00:01:28.631 --> 00:01:29.464
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be able to easily access</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the memories you have about how </v>

33
00:01:32.681 --> 00:01:33.514
<v Speaker 1>annoying they are and have difficult </v>
<v Speaker 1>time accessing the memories about how </v>

34
00:01:36.851 --> 00:01:39.430
<v Speaker 1>wonderful they mean he was quite high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

35
00:01:39.431 --> 00:01:40.264
<v Speaker 1>and you know that because sometimes you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get angry with someone who had an </v>

36
00:01:42.161 --> 00:01:42.994
<v Speaker 1>argument with them and you sort of clue </v>
<v Speaker 1>in later you'll snap out of you're more </v>

37
00:01:46.151 --> 00:01:48.490
<v Speaker 1>or less possessed state and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

38
00:01:48.491 --> 00:01:49.324
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

39
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.810
<v Speaker 1>I really wasn't taking the context into </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind and I was kind of harsh,</v>

40
00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.340
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

41
00:01:54.341 --> 00:01:55.780
<v Speaker 1>so and so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you think,</v>

42
00:01:55.781 --> 00:01:56.614
<v Speaker 1>well who's in control?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the question the </v>

43
00:01:58.871 --> 00:01:59.704
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalysts are really interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And their answer is it's not generally </v>

44
00:02:03.041 --> 00:02:03.874
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's very terrifying reading in </v>

45
00:02:06.101 --> 00:02:06.934
<v Speaker 1>some sense because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people like to think of themselves as </v>

46
00:02:09.011 --> 00:02:12.010
<v Speaker 1>masters of their own house so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's just,</v>

47
00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.990
<v Speaker 1>it's only vaguely true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know people,</v>

48
00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.460
<v Speaker 1>you know that too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause you make</v>

49
00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.280
<v Speaker 1>maybe new years eve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

50
00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.390
<v Speaker 1>what do you call those resolutions?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How you're going to be a better person.</v>

51
00:02:25.391 --> 00:02:27.180
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the most common ones is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

52
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.870
<v Speaker 1>you're going to hit the gym three times </v>
<v Speaker 1>a week.</v>

53
00:02:28.871 --> 00:02:29.411
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

54
00:02:29.411 --> 00:02:32.650
<v Speaker 1>you're not actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so very few people do.</v>

55
00:02:32.651 --> 00:02:34.480
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

56
00:02:34.481 --> 00:02:37.310
<v Speaker 1>it's hard and so you don't want to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard things and what they aren't.</v>

57
00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.160
<v Speaker 1>The reason for that is because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard.</v>

58
00:02:39.161 --> 00:02:39.994
<v Speaker 1>So it doesn't take much explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's also because you can't just </v>

59
00:02:42.491 --> 00:02:43.324
<v Speaker 1>tell yourself what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's annoying too because life </v>

60
00:02:46.181 --> 00:02:47.590
<v Speaker 1>would be a lot easier if you could just </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

61
00:02:47.591 --> 00:02:48.424
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you don't sit down study for two </v>

62
00:02:50.291 --> 00:02:51.124
<v Speaker 1>hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't watch cats on youtube or whatever </v>

63
00:02:52.721 --> 00:02:54.520
<v Speaker 1>it is that you're watching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And No,</v>

64
00:02:54.521 --> 00:02:54.971
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

65
00:02:54.971 --> 00:02:55.804
<v Speaker 1>that isn't what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You sit there and you study for a while </v>

66
00:02:57.311 --> 00:02:58.144
<v Speaker 1>and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're thinking about cats and next </v>

67
00:02:59.321 --> 00:03:03.250
<v Speaker 1>thing you know you're watching haunted </v>
<v Speaker 1>mansion's in London or some damn thing,</v>

68
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:04.533
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

69
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:06.123
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a scary idea in some sense </v>

70
00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:10.450
<v Speaker 1>because if you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

71
00:03:10.451 --> 00:03:12.580
<v Speaker 1>if you're not really master of your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>house,</v>

72
00:03:12.581 --> 00:03:13.414
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have yourself under full </v>

73
00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.720
<v Speaker 1>voluntary control and you certainly </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

74
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.030
<v Speaker 1>then what does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

75
00:03:19.031 --> 00:03:19.864
<v Speaker 1>Freud is interesting in that regard </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he really talked about the </v>

76
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.033
<v Speaker 1>motive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>power of fundamental motivational </v>

77
00:03:25.931 --> 00:03:28.960
<v Speaker 1>systems mostly for Freud it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggression in sexuality,</v>

78
00:03:28.961 --> 00:03:29.621
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those are,</v>

79
00:03:29.621 --> 00:03:30.820
<v Speaker 1>those are big motivators.</v>

80
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.810
<v Speaker 1>Let's make no mistake about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he thought of you as,</v>

81
00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.853
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

82
00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.330
<v Speaker 1>that the conscious part of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality may be as the,</v>

83
00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.000
<v Speaker 1>it's like the captain of a ship with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very unruly crew.</v>

84
00:03:43.001 --> 00:03:46.450
<v Speaker 1>It's a nice metaphor because of course </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ships on the ocean and the ocean can</v>

85
00:03:46.451 --> 00:03:47.284
<v Speaker 1>be very stormy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you can only sort of plot your </v>

86
00:03:49.961 --> 00:03:52.300
<v Speaker 1>course and you have to work with what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>thrown at you.</v>

87
00:03:52.301 --> 00:03:56.360
<v Speaker 1>And then the unruly crew is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's all your drives.</v>

88
00:03:56.361 --> 00:03:58.390
<v Speaker 1>It drives is the wrong way of thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

89
00:03:58.950 --> 00:03:59.783
<v Speaker 1>That I liked the psychoanalytic notion </v>
<v Speaker 1>of subpersonality because a </v>

90
00:04:03.821 --> 00:04:07.360
<v Speaker 1>subpersonality has a viewpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's things it wants and it plants.</v>

91
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.450
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

92
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.250
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an,</v>

93
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.220
<v Speaker 1>it's a living entity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not some dead cognitive system.</v>

94
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.390
<v Speaker 1>So Freud was interested in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>more about,</v>

95
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.710
<v Speaker 1>I would say the biological underpinnings</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the subpersonalities,</v>

96
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:20.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he was,</v>

97
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:21.753
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was quite biologically oriented and </v>

98
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.780
<v Speaker 1>he realized that sexuality and </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggression,</v>

99
00:04:25.781 --> 00:04:30.550
<v Speaker 1>we're very fundamental sub personalities</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's young and young is much</v>

100
00:04:30.551 --> 00:04:31.384
<v Speaker 1>more terrifying than Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really saying a lot because </v>

101
00:04:33.491 --> 00:04:34.630
<v Speaker 1>Freud's quite terrified.</v>

102
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.050
<v Speaker 1>But Young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

103
00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.710
<v Speaker 1>he's just terrified beyond belief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

104
00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:39.813
<v Speaker 1>for you the sub personalities that make </v>
<v Speaker 1>you up are thousands and thousands of </v>

105
00:04:44.651 --> 00:04:45.484
<v Speaker 1>years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're cultural constructions that are </v>

106
00:04:46.751 --> 00:04:50.710
<v Speaker 1>thousands and thousands of years old and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have you in their grip.</v>

107
00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.540
<v Speaker 1>So for union,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

108
00:04:52.541 --> 00:04:54.880
<v Speaker 1>one of the things he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't remember where it was,</v>

109
00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.100
<v Speaker 1>I love this phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so true.</v>

110
00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.450
<v Speaker 1>And you can think about this for like </v>
<v Speaker 1>five years and,</v>

111
00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.620
<v Speaker 1>and you can still think about it after </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

112
00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.650
<v Speaker 1>One of the things young said was that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't have ideas,</v>

113
00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:06.573
<v Speaker 1>ideas have people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's really something to think </v>

114
00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:12.790
<v Speaker 1>about because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just think about your own situation.</v>

115
00:05:12.791 --> 00:05:16.720
<v Speaker 1>So no doubt you have political views and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think I have political views.</v>

116
00:05:16.721 --> 00:05:19.420
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well no you don't because you share them</v>

117
00:05:19.421 --> 00:05:22.810
<v Speaker 1>with a lot of other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there are certainly not yours.</v>

118
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:24.063
<v Speaker 1>And not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've had a very lengthy historical </v>

119
00:05:28.091 --> 00:05:30.400
<v Speaker 1>development far before you ever showed </v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

120
00:05:30.401 --> 00:05:33.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're rooted in rooted right at the</v>

121
00:05:33.461 --> 00:05:34.294
<v Speaker 1>depths of your culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then of course they'd been </v>

122
00:05:36.041 --> 00:05:36.874
<v Speaker 1>elaborated by one philosopher or another</v>
<v Speaker 1>extensively over the last two or 300 </v>

123
00:05:40.751 --> 00:05:43.180
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's this whole system of thought</v>

124
00:05:43.181 --> 00:05:44.770
<v Speaker 1>and Poof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it had habits.</v>

125
00:05:44.771 --> 00:05:45.820
<v Speaker 1>Your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you think,</v>

126
00:05:45.821 --> 00:05:47.740
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got political views.</v>

127
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.810
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

128
00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:51.483
<v Speaker 1>the political views have you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very salutary thought </v>

129
00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:56.493
<v Speaker 1>because it's one of the ways to stop </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself from being possessed because </v>

130
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:02.780
<v Speaker 1>people get possessed all the time by </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>

131
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.730
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what happened in Nazi Germany.</v>

132
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:06.620
<v Speaker 1>That's what happened in the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 1>Union.</v>

133
00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.280
<v Speaker 1>It happens everywhere all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might think,</v>

134
00:06:10.281 --> 00:06:13.160
<v Speaker 1>well possessed is a little strong but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

135
00:06:13.161 --> 00:06:15.110
<v Speaker 1>it's not actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very nice,</v>

136
00:06:15.111 --> 00:06:15.944
<v Speaker 1>it's a metaphor obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the right kind of metaphor </v>

137
00:06:19.221 --> 00:06:22.100
<v Speaker 1>because a body of ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like political ideas,</v>

138
00:06:22.101 --> 00:06:24.050
<v Speaker 1>there are living thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

139
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:25.123
<v Speaker 1>they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not some dead dusty words on a </v>

140
00:06:27.531 --> 00:06:28.430
<v Speaker 1>bookshelf somewhere.</v>

141
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.340
<v Speaker 1>They're an integral part of a dynamic </v>
<v Speaker 1>society and,</v>

142
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.270
<v Speaker 1>and the motive force,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those ideas have motivates you.</v>

143
00:06:35.271 --> 00:06:36.104
<v Speaker 1>You're in their grip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you can tell when you're talking </v>

144
00:06:39.381 --> 00:06:41.150
<v Speaker 1>to someone who's completely possessed by</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

145
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.460
<v Speaker 1>by an idea system or in India logical </v>
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>

146
00:06:43.461 --> 00:06:47.600
<v Speaker 1>cause they'll just bore you to death </v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you happen to believe exactly the</v>

147
00:06:47.601 --> 00:06:48.434
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they will spout out a few of their </v>

148
00:06:49.701 --> 00:06:50.534
<v Speaker 1>fundamental belief axioms and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can identify which system they're part </v>

149
00:06:54.171 --> 00:06:58.190
<v Speaker 1>of and then they just speak in cliches </v>
<v Speaker 1>from that point onward.</v>

150
00:06:58.191 --> 00:06:59.024
<v Speaker 1>And you can predict everything you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to say if you know the </v>

151
00:07:00.921 --> 00:07:04.160
<v Speaker 1>axioms of the system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's very,</v>

152
00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.690
<v Speaker 1>it's very non authentic speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that would be a way that,</v>

153
00:07:08.691 --> 00:07:11.120
<v Speaker 1>say someone like Rogers or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

154
00:07:11.121 --> 00:07:11.954
<v Speaker 1>or Abraham Maslow who were humanists of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the 1960s might talk about it because </v>

155
00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:16.273
<v Speaker 1>the person isn't speaking from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>depths of their own experience or from </v>

156
00:07:18.561 --> 00:07:20.990
<v Speaker 1>even their embodied knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

157
00:07:20.991 --> 00:07:23.390
<v Speaker 1>they're just mouthpieces for abstract </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>

158
00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:24.703
<v Speaker 1>And so it's very frightening to realize </v>
<v Speaker 1>the extent to which you can be the </v>

159
00:07:29.061 --> 00:07:31.400
<v Speaker 1>mouthpiece for abstract ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

160
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.100
<v Speaker 1>And it's actually one of the dangers of </v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming educated,</v>

161
00:07:34.101 --> 00:07:36.500
<v Speaker 1>especially in a mass system like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>university system.</v>

162
00:07:36.501 --> 00:07:37.334
<v Speaker 1>Because a lot of what happens to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you come to university is that </v>

163
00:07:39.381 --> 00:07:44.381
<v Speaker 1>you're fed a set of</v>
<v Speaker 1>pre digested ideas.</v>

164
00:07:45.111 --> 00:07:46.880
<v Speaker 1>I suppose that's one way of thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>

165
00:07:46.881 --> 00:07:48.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's very easy for you to think,</v>

166
00:07:48.951 --> 00:07:49.250
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

167
00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:51.800
<v Speaker 1>those are now your ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not,</v>

168
00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:55.520
<v Speaker 1>they're not lots of ideas that you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to earn.</v>

169
00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:57.163
<v Speaker 1>And if it's a great idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you really have to earn it because </v>

170
00:08:00.111 --> 00:08:03.230
<v Speaker 1>why should you just be able to come </v>
<v Speaker 1>along and like pluck up a great idea.</v>

171
00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:05.023
<v Speaker 1>That's not how things work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to earn things that are </v>

172
00:08:06.921 --> 00:08:08.690
<v Speaker 1>valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

173
00:08:08.691 --> 00:08:10.790
<v Speaker 1>the depth psychologist man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're so good at that.</v>

174
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:13.970
<v Speaker 1>It's lovely to read them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the problem too is with a lot of the</v>

175
00:08:13.971 --> 00:08:14.804
<v Speaker 1>people we're going to talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to summarize their </v>

176
00:08:16.911 --> 00:08:18.440
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

177
00:08:18.441 --> 00:08:21.320
<v Speaker 1>cause often the devil's in the details.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

178
00:08:21.321 --> 00:08:23.750
<v Speaker 1>you might look at someone like piaget is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good example.</v>

179
00:08:23.751 --> 00:08:25.670
<v Speaker 1>The constructivists that we talked about</v>
<v Speaker 1>briefly,</v>

180
00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:27.770
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy wrote dozens of books.</v>

181
00:08:27.771 --> 00:08:28.604
<v Speaker 1>He can't just summarize those suckers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not one coherent theory that you </v>

182
00:08:31.941 --> 00:08:33.640
<v Speaker 1>can boil down to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

183
00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:34.513
<v Speaker 1>10 axioms and then you can read it while</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're flying from Toronto to Montreal </v>

184
00:08:37.911 --> 00:08:38.780
<v Speaker 1>and Poof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're appears.</v>

185
00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:41.330
<v Speaker 1>Yet even psychologists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it doesn't work like that.</v>

186
00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:42.673
<v Speaker 1>The people who may,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who formulated these theories were </v>

187
00:08:44.151 --> 00:08:46.910
<v Speaker 1>extremely intelligent and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

188
00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:48.003
<v Speaker 1>and there are often great writers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so a lot of the knowledge is </v>

189
00:08:50.571 --> 00:08:51.404
<v Speaker 1>actually in the writing itself and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>in what you can extract out from the </v>

190
00:08:54.291 --> 00:08:55.124
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

191
00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:57.600
<v Speaker 1>and most of the theorists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud Young,</v>

192
00:08:57.601 --> 00:08:58.770
<v Speaker 1>it's harder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but freud,</v>

193
00:08:58.771 --> 00:09:02.250
<v Speaker 1>Rogers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people like that you can extract out the</v>

194
00:09:02.251 --> 00:09:04.650
<v Speaker 1>gist of their theories and then you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

195
00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:06.293
<v Speaker 1>what would you say?</v>

196
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:10.360
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can stereotype it or you can correct</v>

197
00:09:10.361 --> 00:09:11.160
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure it.</v>

198
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:11.993
<v Speaker 1>And then you can point out how your </v>
<v Speaker 1>caricatures observed and then you can </v>

199
00:09:14.581 --> 00:09:16.620
<v Speaker 1>feel like you're even smarter than </v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud.</v>

200
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:17.640
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not.</v>

201
00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:18.773
<v Speaker 1>So it's not a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so these people should also be </v>

202
00:09:21.571 --> 00:09:24.390
<v Speaker 1>approached with respect cause man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have so much to tell you.</v>

203
00:09:24.391 --> 00:09:26.520
<v Speaker 1>It's so useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

204
00:09:26.521 --> 00:09:29.070
<v Speaker 1>So we talked about the depth </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologist,</v>

205
00:09:29.071 --> 00:09:32.640
<v Speaker 1>we talked about the constructivists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we didn't talk about the humanists,</v>

206
00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:33.923
<v Speaker 1>the existentialists and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenologists and a mouthful of </v>

207
00:09:36.121 --> 00:09:36.901
<v Speaker 1>words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

208
00:09:36.901 --> 00:09:40.560
<v Speaker 1>So let's put a little bit of foundation </v>
<v Speaker 1>under those.</v>

209
00:09:40.561 --> 00:09:41.394
<v Speaker 1>So if you're a humanist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be a humanist means really to be a </v>

210
00:09:45.301 --> 00:09:50.220
<v Speaker 1>creature of the enlightenment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a human is thought in some sense,</v>

211
00:09:50.221 --> 00:09:51.810
<v Speaker 1>at least this is what the humanist </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

212
00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:52.703
<v Speaker 1>they think of it as post religious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think of a humanistic thought as </v>

213
00:09:58.051 --> 00:10:03.051
<v Speaker 1>putting the value of the human being at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the center of the cosmos in some sense,</v>

214
00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:04.223
<v Speaker 1>valuing the person as they are and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>also valuing the person that they could </v>

215
00:10:07.291 --> 00:10:08.124
<v Speaker 1>be and and promoting the pathways of </v>
<v Speaker 1>development that would allow people to </v>

216
00:10:15.151 --> 00:10:19.440
<v Speaker 1>become what they could be as creatures </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are valuable in their own right.</v>

217
00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:24.680
<v Speaker 1>So a humanist for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be very skeptical of claims.</v>

218
00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:30.200
<v Speaker 1>So let's say standard Christian claims,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I use that example because the realm</v>

219
00:10:31.711 --> 00:10:36.480
<v Speaker 1>of ideas that these thinkers emerged out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of was almost always Judeo Christian.</v>

220
00:10:36.481 --> 00:10:37.410
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

221
00:10:37.411 --> 00:10:39.810
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the roots of their thinking are in those</v>

222
00:10:39.811 --> 00:10:42.990
<v Speaker 1>systems and you can't understand their </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking without understanding that.</v>

223
00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:47.970
<v Speaker 1>And so part of humanism was a rebellion </v>
<v Speaker 1>against the idea that life on earth,</v>

224
00:10:47.971 --> 00:10:48.804
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was of limited value because everything </v>

225
00:10:50.281 --> 00:10:53.280
<v Speaker 1>of any importance was going to happen in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the afterlife after you die.</v>

226
00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:55.620
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

227
00:10:55.621 --> 00:10:57.570
<v Speaker 1>it's here and now it's right now that </v>
<v Speaker 1>matters.</v>

228
00:10:58.020 --> 00:10:58.853
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>life in the present is what's important </v>

229
00:11:00.931 --> 00:11:01.764
<v Speaker 1>and you don't need some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>afterlife for some kind of belief in a </v>

230
00:11:04.351 --> 00:11:07.890
<v Speaker 1>transcendent reality in order to find </v>
<v Speaker 1>value right here and now.</v>

231
00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:09.330
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>

232
00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:11.070
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of good things about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea,</v>

233
00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:12.101
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

234
00:11:12.101 --> 00:11:12.934
<v Speaker 1>and the whole idea that you can improve </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself in some sense is that </v>

235
00:11:16.381 --> 00:11:17.460
<v Speaker 1>humanistic idea.</v>

236
00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:18.330
<v Speaker 1>And most of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

237
00:11:18.331 --> 00:11:20.910
<v Speaker 1>how many of you believe that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>improve yourself?</v>

238
00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:25.530
<v Speaker 1>So is there anybody who doesn't believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's,</v>

239
00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:26.543
<v Speaker 1>that's willing to admit it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So usually people only don't believe </v>

240
00:11:29.791 --> 00:11:31.920
<v Speaker 1>that if they're very depressed or </v>
<v Speaker 1>hopeless,</v>

241
00:11:31.921 --> 00:11:33.390
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not self evident,</v>

242
00:11:33.391 --> 00:11:34.224
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

243
00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.153
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in many cultures you can think of </v>

244
00:11:36.331 --> 00:11:37.830
<v Speaker 1>medieval culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

245
00:11:37.831 --> 00:11:41.040
<v Speaker 1>in Europe where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were sort of stuck in your position.</v>

246
00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:43.500
<v Speaker 1>There was no real idea of self </v>
<v Speaker 1>improvement.</v>

247
00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:44.453
<v Speaker 1>You could try not to sin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you aren't going to get like </v>

248
00:11:46.681 --> 00:11:49.950
<v Speaker 1>radically better in some way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were just who you are.</v>

249
00:11:49.951 --> 00:11:51.810
<v Speaker 1>And that was that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But not,</v>

250
00:11:51.811 --> 00:11:52.644
<v Speaker 1>that's not the case for the no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Existentialists there are kind of a </v>

251
00:11:56.411 --> 00:11:57.244
<v Speaker 1>different kettle of fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know when Fred talks about </v>

252
00:12:00.821 --> 00:12:01.654
<v Speaker 1>psychopathology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of personality is about </v>

253
00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:04.750
<v Speaker 1>pathology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

254
00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:05.583
<v Speaker 1>How personal this can go wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud kind of thinks of the normal </v>

255
00:12:08.231 --> 00:12:12.100
<v Speaker 1>person roughly speaking as healthy in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their normality,</v>

256
00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:13.143
<v Speaker 1>but perhaps transformed into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathological version of themselves by </v>

257
00:12:16.391 --> 00:12:17.224
<v Speaker 1>some sort of past trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that might often be an abusive </v>

258
00:12:20.081 --> 00:12:20.950
<v Speaker 1>childhood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

259
00:12:20.951 --> 00:12:21.784
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe a sexually abusive childhood </v>

260
00:12:23.471 --> 00:12:24.304
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud talked a lot about that and it </v>

261
00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:28.930
<v Speaker 1>happens fairly frequently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for Freud,</v>

262
00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:32.710
<v Speaker 1>all things considered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you weren't healthy,</v>

263
00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:34.630
<v Speaker 1>there was a reason for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

264
00:12:34.631 --> 00:12:35.464
<v Speaker 1>something terrible that happened to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you needed to come to terms with </v>

265
00:12:37.721 --> 00:12:38.554
<v Speaker 1>that terrible thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However you might do that and put </v>

266
00:12:40.691 --> 00:12:41.524
<v Speaker 1>yourself back together and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could wander along being a healthy </v>

267
00:12:43.571 --> 00:12:45.440
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the existentialists,</v>

268
00:12:45.441 --> 00:12:46.274
<v Speaker 1>that's not how they think at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think that standard human being is </v>

269
00:12:49.631 --> 00:12:50.464
<v Speaker 1>pathological.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason they think that is </v>

270
00:12:53.081 --> 00:12:55.810
<v Speaker 1>because they think that self conscious </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence,</v>

271
00:12:55.811 --> 00:12:56.644
<v Speaker 1>so life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the life of a creature that knows it's </v>

272
00:12:59.381 --> 00:13:01.330
<v Speaker 1>bounded in time and space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

273
00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:06.510
<v Speaker 1>Knows it's vulnerable to disease and </v>
<v Speaker 1>illness and death and the loss of things</v>

274
00:13:07.061 --> 00:13:08.500
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they love.</v>

275
00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:13.030
<v Speaker 1>And the disintegration of all things in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense is that's enough of a problem</v>

276
00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:17.620
<v Speaker 1>to give you problems without having to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been abused by it.</v>

277
00:13:17.621 --> 00:13:18.454
<v Speaker 1>And so the existentialists view life </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself as a problem of sufficient </v>

278
00:13:22.901 --> 00:13:27.901
<v Speaker 1>magnitude that it can destabilize you </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentally merely by being aware of it.</v>

279
00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:29.973
<v Speaker 1>And so they also believe that often what</v>
<v Speaker 1>people do as a consequence of that is </v>

280
00:13:33.161 --> 00:13:35.290
<v Speaker 1>flee from their own awareness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

281
00:13:35.291 --> 00:13:38.050
<v Speaker 1>So how do you deal with the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>life is suffering?</v>

282
00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:39.280
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't think about it.</v>

283
00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:41.680
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for an existentialist,</v>

284
00:13:41.681 --> 00:13:45.040
<v Speaker 1>that's not a very good answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would also say generally speaking,</v>

285
00:13:45.041 --> 00:13:45.874
<v Speaker 1>for clinical psychologists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's also not a very good answer </v>

286
00:13:47.801 --> 00:13:48.634
<v Speaker 1>because the literature suggests pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>damn strongly that the harder you run </v>

287
00:13:53.591 --> 00:13:54.424
<v Speaker 1>from something you're afraid of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the larger it becomes and the faster it </v>

288
00:13:57.461 --> 00:13:58.294
<v Speaker 1>chases you.</v>

289
00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:03.750
<v Speaker 1>So avoidance of avoidance is generally a</v>
<v Speaker 1>very bad strategy.</v>

290
00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.073
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not always the case because </v>

291
00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:09.250
<v Speaker 1>sometimes if you can't do anything about</v>
<v Speaker 1>something really,</v>

292
00:14:09.251 --> 00:14:10.210
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

293
00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:12.123
<v Speaker 1>there's not a lot of sense spending a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of time planning and struggling </v>

294
00:14:15.191 --> 00:14:15.941
<v Speaker 1>against it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

295
00:14:15.941 --> 00:14:19.210
<v Speaker 1>when sometimes people are in generally </v>
<v Speaker 1>genuinely hopeless situations,</v>

296
00:14:19.211 --> 00:14:20.470
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but often did not.</v>

297
00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:23.830
<v Speaker 1>So I really liked the [inaudible] man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're,</v>

298
00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:24.500
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

299
00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:27.090
<v Speaker 1>all the people that we're going to talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about there,</v>

300
00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:30.400
<v Speaker 1>you're thinking is extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>valuable.</v>

301
00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:33.100
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it helps situate you in your own life.</v>

302
00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:33.963
<v Speaker 1>It helps clarify the nature of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to other people in the </v>

303
00:14:36.581 --> 00:14:37.414
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It helps you lay out what your future </v>

304
00:14:39.221 --> 00:14:43.600
<v Speaker 1>could be if you were the creatures that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could be really wonderful.</v>

305
00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:48.210
<v Speaker 1>Phenomenologists there are tricky bunch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

306
00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:52.340
<v Speaker 1>fundamental phenomenologist was Martin </v>
<v Speaker 1>Heidegger,</v>

307
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:57.790
<v Speaker 1>who was also somewhat also somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 1>tangled up with the Nazis.</v>

308
00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:59.690
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

309
00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:01.700
<v Speaker 1>which was clearly not a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

310
00:15:01.701 --> 00:15:02.534
<v Speaker 1>people debate about whether or not you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can separate out his philosophy from </v>

311
00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:08.990
<v Speaker 1>what tangled them up with the Nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think you can,</v>

312
00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:12.140
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

313
00:15:12.141 --> 00:15:12.974
<v Speaker 1>heidegger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heidegger learned to take a fresh look </v>

314
00:15:17.931 --> 00:15:20.780
<v Speaker 1>at the nature of reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so heidegger,</v>

315
00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:21.693
<v Speaker 1>his idea was that we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we made a fundamental philosophical era </v>

316
00:15:24.801 --> 00:15:27.950
<v Speaker 1>way back when when we were Greek,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient Greek,</v>

317
00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:31.010
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that we started concentrating on the</v>

318
00:15:31.011 --> 00:15:33.460
<v Speaker 1>wrong elements of he didn't read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't recall it.</v>

319
00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:34.303
<v Speaker 1>Reality calls it being so a </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenologist is someone who's </v>

320
00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:40.130
<v Speaker 1>concerned with Ba and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think,</v>

321
00:15:40.131 --> 00:15:42.470
<v Speaker 1>well what's the difference between being</v>
<v Speaker 1>in reality?</v>

322
00:15:42.471 --> 00:15:43.304
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is it depends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depends on how you define being and </v>

323
00:15:46.371 --> 00:15:51.371
<v Speaker 1>it depends on how you define reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So heidegger's observation was that for,</v>

324
00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:54.110
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for modern people,</v>

325
00:15:54.111 --> 00:15:59.090
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality is sort of a d animated material</v>

326
00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.080
<v Speaker 1>objective.</v>

327
00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:03.260
<v Speaker 1>Substrata it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's dead in its essence,</v>

328
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:04.183
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the things that are most real are </v>

329
00:16:06.351 --> 00:16:07.184
<v Speaker 1>precisely those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can think about that it's all </v>

330
00:16:08.461 --> 00:16:10.640
<v Speaker 1>objective reality for all intents and </v>
<v Speaker 1>purposes.</v>

331
00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:11.773
<v Speaker 1>But what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what heidegger tried to point out is </v>

332
00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:17.600
<v Speaker 1>that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a choice in some sense because your</v>

333
00:16:17.601 --> 00:16:21.830
<v Speaker 1>knowledge is finite because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally ignorant about all things.</v>

334
00:16:21.831 --> 00:16:26.480
<v Speaker 1>You have to decide that certain things </v>
<v Speaker 1>are true and then act from that point.</v>

335
00:16:26.481 --> 00:16:28.100
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heidegger's point was,</v>

336
00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:29.203
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of things that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>decide about at the very fundamental </v>

337
00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:33.950
<v Speaker 1>level of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of axiom.</v>

338
00:16:33.951 --> 00:16:36.260
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things you can decide </v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

339
00:16:36.261 --> 00:16:37.094
<v Speaker 1>is whether or not the objective world is</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's more real or whether or not your </v>

340
00:16:41.091 --> 00:16:45.230
<v Speaker 1>lived experience is what's more real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you might think,</v>

341
00:16:45.231 --> 00:16:46.064
<v Speaker 1>well what's the distinction there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say the distinction is </v>

342
00:16:49.101 --> 00:16:49.934
<v Speaker 1>probably something like watching someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>in pain on a video and being in pain </v>

343
00:16:54.621 --> 00:16:56.240
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

344
00:16:56.241 --> 00:17:00.140
<v Speaker 1>so is a good example of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of an element of being,</v>

345
00:17:00.141 --> 00:17:05.060
<v Speaker 1>because it's obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's obviously you experienced it within</v>

346
00:17:05.061 --> 00:17:05.894
<v Speaker 1>your own.</v>

347
00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:11.870
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to talk about this because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>uses different terminology.</v>

348
00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:16.760
<v Speaker 1>Pain is an element of your big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

349
00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:18.320
<v Speaker 1>it's not something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

350
00:17:18.321 --> 00:17:19.154
<v Speaker 1>the pain itself is not something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can even conceptualize in objective </v>

351
00:17:21.951 --> 00:17:23.420
<v Speaker 1>terms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can measure it,</v>

352
00:17:23.421 --> 00:17:24.254
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe your heart rate goes up when </v>

353
00:17:24.921 --> 00:17:28.280
<v Speaker 1>you're in pain or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or your facial expressions change,</v>

354
00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:30.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can index it.</v>

355
00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:35.090
<v Speaker 1>But the indexes are not the phenomena </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's hence phenomenology.</v>

356
00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:36.493
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the phenomenologists have built </v>

357
00:17:38.031 --> 00:17:42.170
<v Speaker 1>up an entire system of thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>predicated on the initial axiom that the</v>

358
00:17:42.171 --> 00:17:43.004
<v Speaker 1>best way to approach life is to assume </v>
<v Speaker 1>that being is the fundamental reality </v>

359
00:17:47.721 --> 00:17:50.700
<v Speaker 1>rather than the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the fundamental level.</v>

360
00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:52.350
<v Speaker 1>And then you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

361
00:17:52.351 --> 00:17:54.150
<v Speaker 1>why do people farther with that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing?</v>

362
00:17:54.151 --> 00:17:57.890
<v Speaker 1>And part of it is one of the cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is an existentialist plate.</v>

363
00:17:58.050 --> 00:17:58.883
<v Speaker 1>One of the consequences of developing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the objective theory of existence was </v>

364
00:18:03.151 --> 00:18:06.420
<v Speaker 1>obviously all of the amazing technology </v>
<v Speaker 1>we have around us and you know,</v>

365
00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:07.860
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank God for that.</v>

366
00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:09.890
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise we'd be sitting outside </v>
<v Speaker 1>freezing.</v>

367
00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.033
<v Speaker 1>But one of the consequences of that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>once people established or objective </v>

368
00:18:14.581 --> 00:18:15.414
<v Speaker 1>reality and then defined it as </v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimately real terrible questions of </v>

369
00:18:19.561 --> 00:18:20.910
<v Speaker 1>the meaning of life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ropes,</v>

370
00:18:20.911 --> 00:18:22.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if the world,</v>

371
00:18:22.021 --> 00:18:24.540
<v Speaker 1>the universe is made out of nothing but </v>
<v Speaker 1>dead matter,</v>

372
00:18:24.541 --> 00:18:25.374
<v Speaker 1>it's eternally existing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're nothing but a candle flash in the </v>

373
00:18:28.591 --> 00:18:29.424
<v Speaker 1>wind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea creeps into your mind that </v>

374
00:18:31.111 --> 00:18:33.690
<v Speaker 1>perhaps all of the damn suffering isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>worth it or,</v>

375
00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:35.730
<v Speaker 1>or can put it another way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

376
00:18:35.731 --> 00:18:36.564
<v Speaker 1>does your life really have any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any real meaning or is that just an </v>

377
00:18:39.511 --> 00:18:41.280
<v Speaker 1>illusion?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

378
00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:42.443
<v Speaker 1>heidegger would say the reason that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have that problem is because you're </v>

379
00:18:45.451 --> 00:18:47.460
<v Speaker 1>approaching the entire problem wrong.</v>

380
00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:50.070
<v Speaker 1>Clearly things have meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just don't.</v>

381
00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:50.933
<v Speaker 1>If you make the hypothesis that's what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>our objective is ultimately real and </v>

382
00:18:54.961 --> 00:18:58.470
<v Speaker 1>everything else is merely a secondary </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of that.</v>

383
00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:01.110
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's complicated.</v>

384
00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:03.060
<v Speaker 1>It takes a while to get your head around</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

385
00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:04.183
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the humanists and the existentialists </v>

386
00:19:07.141 --> 00:19:08.880
<v Speaker 1>and to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the phenomenologists,</v>

387
00:19:08.881 --> 00:19:11.400
<v Speaker 1>they all came out of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there isn't,</v>

388
00:19:11.401 --> 00:19:13.590
<v Speaker 1>there was a variety of sources for their</v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts.</v>

389
00:19:13.591 --> 00:19:17.580
<v Speaker 1>And I would say one of them is the clash</v>
<v Speaker 1>between religion and science or between,</v>

390
00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:20.490
<v Speaker 1>between value and objective truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to,</v>

391
00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:24.450
<v Speaker 1>to rectify the division.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Piaget himself was trying to do some</v>

392
00:19:24.451 --> 00:19:25.830
<v Speaker 1>of that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was young,</v>

393
00:19:25.831 --> 00:19:27.210
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

394
00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:28.253
<v Speaker 1>and the other thing is a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>existentialist and humanist work was </v>

395
00:19:30.901 --> 00:19:33.030
<v Speaker 1>post World War II.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

396
00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:34.493
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after World War Two happened with its </v>

397
00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:39.750
<v Speaker 1>immense catastrophes of course people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who were thinking about human nature,</v>

398
00:19:39.751 --> 00:19:43.710
<v Speaker 1>we're very interested in why such a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing could happen and existentialism at</v>

399
00:19:43.711 --> 00:19:44.544
<v Speaker 1>least as a psychological school arose in</v>
<v Speaker 1>part as a reaction to the horrors of </v>

400
00:19:48.031 --> 00:19:48.864
<v Speaker 1>World War II.</v>

401
00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:49.883
<v Speaker 1>It's a very serious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very serious branch of </v>

402
00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:52.853
<v Speaker 1>psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it would mostly characterize </v>

403
00:19:54.251 --> 00:19:58.980
<v Speaker 1>thinking in the 1950s before the hippies</v>
<v Speaker 1>came along and made everything sweetness</v>

404
00:19:58.981 --> 00:20:00.510
<v Speaker 1>and light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

405
00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:03.510
<v Speaker 1>which is more where Roger's in a maslow </v>
<v Speaker 1>outfit.</v>

406
00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:06.150
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're going to talk about them a fair</v>

407
00:20:06.151 --> 00:20:06.984
<v Speaker 1>bit that the three different categories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a kind of a strange approach in </v>

408
00:20:10.531 --> 00:20:11.364
<v Speaker 1>some sense that this class takes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I talked to you about some </v>

409
00:20:13.381 --> 00:20:16.110
<v Speaker 1>psychologists in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that period.</v>

410
00:20:16.111 --> 00:20:16.944
<v Speaker 1>But the other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people I talked to you mostly about </v>

411
00:20:18.721 --> 00:20:21.300
<v Speaker 1>aren't sec,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not technically psychologists.</v>

412
00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:23.580
<v Speaker 1>Depends on what you mean by </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologist.</v>

413
00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:24.863
<v Speaker 1>After all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talk a lot about Nietzsche and </v>

414
00:20:26.191 --> 00:20:29.700
<v Speaker 1>Dostoevsky and also a lot about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russian literary figure.</v>

415
00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:34.110
<v Speaker 1>Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn who wrote a book </v>
<v Speaker 1>called the Gulag archipelago,</v>

416
00:20:34.111 --> 00:20:34.944
<v Speaker 1>which was one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a few cataclysmic events that </v>

417
00:20:39.931 --> 00:20:43.500
<v Speaker 1>brought the totalitarian system of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Soviet Union to a halt.</v>

418
00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:44.813
<v Speaker 1>And you can argue about what they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of them for sure with social </v>

419
00:20:48.191 --> 00:20:50.920
<v Speaker 1>nuts as published publication of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gulag Archipelago,</v>

420
00:20:50.921 --> 00:20:55.630
<v Speaker 1>which is a 2,700 word book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2,700 page book.</v>

421
00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:56.693
<v Speaker 1>Can I get that right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That describes what it was like to be </v>

422
00:21:00.941 --> 00:21:04.540
<v Speaker 1>there and how many people died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a,</v>

423
00:21:04.541 --> 00:21:07.960
<v Speaker 1>it's a searing book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He won a Nobel prize and he deserved it.</v>

424
00:21:07.961 --> 00:21:12.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>soldier had some remarkable person.</v>

425
00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:14.680
<v Speaker 1>He's like the Dostoyevsky of the 20th </v>
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>

426
00:21:14.681 --> 00:21:15.514
<v Speaker 1>And that's really saying something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Dostoyevsky is another person I use </v>

427
00:21:18.641 --> 00:21:22.660
<v Speaker 1>a lot in that section.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And both Dostoyevsky and nature regarded</v>

428
00:21:22.661 --> 00:21:25.450
<v Speaker 1>themselves as psychologists </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally.</v>

429
00:21:25.451 --> 00:21:26.284
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's funny because when you think about </v>

430
00:21:27.731 --> 00:21:28.600
<v Speaker 1>scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

431
00:21:28.601 --> 00:21:31.060
<v Speaker 1>usually think about people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>conducting experiments,</v>

432
00:21:31.061 --> 00:21:33.380
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then one of the things,</v>

433
00:21:33.381 --> 00:21:35.260
<v Speaker 1>and you'll notice this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you think about it,</v>

434
00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:36.463
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot of you have taken a fair </v>
<v Speaker 1>number of science courses or one of one </v>

435
00:21:39.101 --> 00:21:39.934
<v Speaker 1>form or another.</v>

436
00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:40.893
<v Speaker 1>And you know a lot of what you're taught</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're taught how to do sides is </v>

437
00:21:43.871 --> 00:21:45.420
<v Speaker 1>how to generate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

438
00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:49.150
<v Speaker 1>how to lay out that experiment property,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to get the methodology right,</v>

439
00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:52.000
<v Speaker 1>how to do the analysis property,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe how to structure the,</v>

440
00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:54.850
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the revealing of your findings in proper</v>

441
00:21:54.851 --> 00:21:56.450
<v Speaker 1>scientific format.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

442
00:21:56.451 --> 00:21:57.284
<v Speaker 1>and how to test a hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things that you're never </v>

443
00:21:59.651 --> 00:22:00.484
<v Speaker 1>really told about as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the hell do you generate the </v>

444
00:22:02.081 --> 00:22:04.210
<v Speaker 1>hypotheses to begin with?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>

445
00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:07.700
<v Speaker 1>really that's at least half of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

446
00:22:07.701 --> 00:22:10.210
<v Speaker 1>And it's probably a lot more than half </v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem.</v>

447
00:22:10.211 --> 00:22:15.211
<v Speaker 1>And so part of being a scientist is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to be a hypothesis generator,</v>

448
00:22:15.701 --> 00:22:19.780
<v Speaker 1>not just a hypothesis test or maybe you </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to be both to be a true scientist,</v>

449
00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:23.560
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe not.</v>

450
00:22:23.561 --> 00:22:26.080
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you can just generate </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary hypothesis.</v>

451
00:22:26.081 --> 00:22:26.914
<v Speaker 1>And it's certainly the case that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>like dusty Sdn Nietzsche were </v>

452
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:32.710
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably good hypotheses generators.</v>

453
00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:33.761
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

454
00:22:33.761 --> 00:22:38.080
<v Speaker 1>they're thinking in many ways underlies </v>
<v Speaker 1>the entire development of thought,</v>

455
00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:39.183
<v Speaker 1>that sort of thought that you guys are </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to encounter in university </v>

456
00:22:40.871 --> 00:22:41.704
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're thinking underlies the entire </v>

457
00:22:42.911 --> 00:22:43.744
<v Speaker 1>development of the edifice of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say both scientific and </v>

458
00:22:46.931 --> 00:22:49.990
<v Speaker 1>nonscientific thought across the entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire 20th century.</v>

459
00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:54.400
<v Speaker 1>And so it's quite entertaining to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go down there and you know,</v>

460
00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:55.263
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wander around the roots of these sorts </v>

461
00:22:56.741 --> 00:22:57.574
<v Speaker 1>of things because you find out how </v>
<v Speaker 1>things are linked together and why </v>

462
00:23:00.941 --> 00:23:03.460
<v Speaker 1>they're linked together and how they </v>
<v Speaker 1>developed and what that means.</v>

463
00:23:03.461 --> 00:23:04.294
<v Speaker 1>And also what it means for you to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>those ideas and why you have them and </v>

464
00:23:07.511 --> 00:23:09.910
<v Speaker 1>what role they play in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

465
00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:12.790
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so after that,</v>

466
00:23:12.791 --> 00:23:13.624
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty much in some sense you </v>
<v Speaker 1>might think that's where the clinical </v>

467
00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:21.760
<v Speaker 1>and philosophical part of the course </v>
<v Speaker 1>ends.</v>

468
00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:22.623
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm a clinical psychologist and most</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the people who are great personality </v>

469
00:23:26.711 --> 00:23:28.510
<v Speaker 1>theorists were clinical psychologists.</v>

470
00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:32.770
<v Speaker 1>And that explains to some degree why the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first part of the courses philosophical,</v>

471
00:23:32.771 --> 00:23:33.604
<v Speaker 1>because the thing about clinical </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologists and psychiatrists and </v>

472
00:23:36.131 --> 00:23:41.131
<v Speaker 1>medical doctors for that matter is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not exactly scientists.</v>

473
00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:45.680
<v Speaker 1>They're more like engineers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what an engineer wants to do,</v>

474
00:23:45.681 --> 00:23:46.514
<v Speaker 1>they might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an engineer might use scientific </v>

475
00:23:47.601 --> 00:23:49.220
<v Speaker 1>knowledge and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good for them.</v>

476
00:23:49.221 --> 00:23:50.054
<v Speaker 1>They should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but really what they want to do is make </v>

477
00:23:51.861 --> 00:23:54.140
<v Speaker 1>something change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to build something,</v>

478
00:23:54.141 --> 00:23:57.370
<v Speaker 1>they want to transform something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to act on the world in,</v>

479
00:23:57.650 --> 00:24:00.440
<v Speaker 1>in a beneficial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>generally in a beneficial way.</v>

480
00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:04.580
<v Speaker 1>While the same thing as the case with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the health domains,</v>

481
00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:07.790
<v Speaker 1>it's like someone comes to you with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological problem.</v>

482
00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:11.630
<v Speaker 1>What you want to do is you want to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>it better and better.</v>

483
00:24:11.631 --> 00:24:12.464
<v Speaker 1>It's not a scientific category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to the degree that you're a </v>

484
00:24:15.591 --> 00:24:16.820
<v Speaker 1>practical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you can say,</v>

485
00:24:16.821 --> 00:24:17.654
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's scientific because worst means </v>

486
00:24:18.711 --> 00:24:19.430
<v Speaker 1>abnormal.</v>

487
00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:20.690
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not right.</v>

488
00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:24.110
<v Speaker 1>You can make that case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's shallow because there's lots of</v>

489
00:24:24.111 --> 00:24:26.420
<v Speaker 1>times when you don't consider normal </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy,</v>

490
00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can send her exceptional,</v>

491
00:24:29.181 --> 00:24:31.000
<v Speaker 1>healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right or,</v>

492
00:24:31.001 --> 00:24:34.760
<v Speaker 1>or maybe you consider exceptional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>desirable and desirable.</v>

493
00:24:34.761 --> 00:24:36.890
<v Speaker 1>It might even be better than healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

494
00:24:36.891 --> 00:24:37.724
<v Speaker 1>So you can't get out of the value domain</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're trying to interact with </v>

495
00:24:40.881 --> 00:24:44.030
<v Speaker 1>people and sort out their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because partly what you're,</v>

496
00:24:44.031 --> 00:24:46.760
<v Speaker 1>what you're always asking is what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong?</v>

497
00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:49.520
<v Speaker 1>What's the matter?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are you dissatisfied?</v>

498
00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:52.100
<v Speaker 1>Why are you suffering?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why aren't you productive?</v>

499
00:24:52.101 --> 00:24:54.470
<v Speaker 1>Why do you fight with everyone?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

500
00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:57.830
<v Speaker 1>why can't you sleep at night?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you wake up screaming,</v>

501
00:24:58.430 --> 00:24:59.263
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why can't you pursue anything that's to </v>

502
00:25:01.881 --> 00:25:04.970
<v Speaker 1>your own benefit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you hurt everyone that you know,</v>

503
00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:07.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are moral questions.</v>

504
00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:09.050
<v Speaker 1>And then the next problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

505
00:25:09.051 --> 00:25:10.250
<v Speaker 1>well what are we going to do about it?</v>

506
00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:11.113
<v Speaker 1>What do you want?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How would you like your life to look if </v>

507
00:25:12.921 --> 00:25:13.754
<v Speaker 1>it could look the way you wanted it to?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then how are we going to get from </v>

508
00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:16.963
<v Speaker 1>where you are to that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those are all their engineering </v>

509
00:25:19.551 --> 00:25:20.384
<v Speaker 1>questions in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but above all their ethical questions </v>

510
00:25:22.701 --> 00:25:25.300
<v Speaker 1>because they deal with how to act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not,</v>

511
00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:28.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to just slide over that big</v>

512
00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:28.843
<v Speaker 1>because that's generally what happens </v>
<v Speaker 1>because physicians and clinical </v>

513
00:25:31.581 --> 00:25:34.730
<v Speaker 1>psychologists and psychiatrists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though their physicians,</v>

514
00:25:34.731 --> 00:25:37.850
<v Speaker 1>they like to think that what they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing is science and that's not right.</v>

515
00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:42.170
<v Speaker 1>It's informed by science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's not the same thing.</v>

516
00:25:42.171 --> 00:25:43.004
<v Speaker 1>It's particularly true with doctors </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're not even trained to be </v>

517
00:25:44.901 --> 00:25:46.730
<v Speaker 1>scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

518
00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:49.250
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's that.</v>

519
00:25:49.251 --> 00:25:52.070
<v Speaker 1>So then the next part of the course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last half,</v>

520
00:25:52.071 --> 00:25:53.120
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty,</v>

521
00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:54.033
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it concentrates on two elements of </v>

522
00:25:55.131 --> 00:25:58.070
<v Speaker 1>personality theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more modern elements I would say,</v>

523
00:25:58.071 --> 00:26:01.190
<v Speaker 1>although not more valuable necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of that.</v>

524
00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:02.533
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly very neurobiological because we </v>

525
00:26:07.521 --> 00:26:11.810
<v Speaker 1>made a lot of strides in the last 5,000 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

526
00:26:11.811 --> 00:26:15.200
<v Speaker 1>let's say in understanding the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

527
00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:18.890
<v Speaker 1>the structure and the function of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>

528
00:26:18.891 --> 00:26:20.840
<v Speaker 1>Like the things we don't know about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain,</v>

529
00:26:20.841 --> 00:26:22.430
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

530
00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:26.200
<v Speaker 1>there are lots of things we don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand about the brain.</v>

531
00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:27.890
<v Speaker 1>We have no idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

532
00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:30.620
<v Speaker 1>what its relationship is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness,</v>

533
00:26:30.621 --> 00:26:33.080
<v Speaker 1>except that more or less it seems </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary.</v>

534
00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:34.940
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so all,</v>

535
00:26:34.941 --> 00:26:35.774
<v Speaker 1>even even that you can dispute to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree because they're great case </v>

536
00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:41.420
<v Speaker 1>histories of people who were born with </v>
<v Speaker 1>hydrocephalus.</v>

537
00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:45.180
<v Speaker 1>And so that means that your skull </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically fills with water.</v>

538
00:26:45.181 --> 00:26:49.380
<v Speaker 1>And the most famous case of that was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>French guy who,</v>

539
00:26:49.381 --> 00:26:50.214
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went for an Mri for God only knows what </v>

540
00:26:52.231 --> 00:26:53.580
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It had nothing to do with,</v>

541
00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:55.650
<v Speaker 1>with uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was eventually discovered,</v>

542
00:26:55.651 --> 00:26:59.370
<v Speaker 1>but he only had 5% of his cortical </v>
<v Speaker 1>tissue is whole brain.</v>

543
00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:00.233
<v Speaker 1>His whole head was full of cerebral </v>
<v Speaker 1>spinal fluid and the brain was just a </v>

544
00:27:03.541 --> 00:27:06.060
<v Speaker 1>little skin around the side that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a balloon.</v>

545
00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:08.340
<v Speaker 1>And as far as they could tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was nothing wrong with them.</v>

546
00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:09.280
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>

547
00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:10.523
<v Speaker 1>well isn't that interesting?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the Hell is all the risks that </v>

548
00:27:12.361 --> 00:27:14.010
<v Speaker 1>brain for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

549
00:27:14.011 --> 00:27:15.420
<v Speaker 1>and then you get the other issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

550
00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you ever heard of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

551
00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:21.030
<v Speaker 1>can't remember her name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's peppered.</v>

552
00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:24.930
<v Speaker 1>She had a famous parrot and African </v>
<v Speaker 1>gray.</v>

553
00:27:24.931 --> 00:27:29.250
<v Speaker 1>You can look it up talking African gray </v>
<v Speaker 1>parrot and that damn parrot,</v>

554
00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:30.113
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing could talk like a four year </v>

555
00:27:31.201 --> 00:27:32.034
<v Speaker 1>old kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Way better than any chimpanzee full </v>

556
00:27:34.291 --> 00:27:36.180
<v Speaker 1>sentences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seemed to know what it was doing.</v>

557
00:27:36.181 --> 00:27:38.670
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's a parrot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

558
00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:42.690
<v Speaker 1>It's brain is this big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how is that even possible?</v>

559
00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:44.430
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

560
00:27:44.431 --> 00:27:46.890
<v Speaker 1>so there's lots of things we don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the brain really,</v>

561
00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:49.020
<v Speaker 1>and he's unbelievably complicated.</v>

562
00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:52.260
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we have learned a lot of things that</v>

563
00:27:52.261 --> 00:27:53.094
<v Speaker 1>are interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We kind of understand the existence and </v>

564
00:27:55.501 --> 00:27:59.520
<v Speaker 1>the location of the fundamental reward </v>
<v Speaker 1>and pain and anxiety circuits.</v>

565
00:27:59.521 --> 00:28:00.690
<v Speaker 1>That's a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are,</v>

566
00:28:00.691 --> 00:28:02.910
<v Speaker 1>those are like discovering major </v>
<v Speaker 1>continents,</v>

567
00:28:02.911 --> 00:28:03.744
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we understand to some degree how people </v>

568
00:28:05.191 --> 00:28:07.230
<v Speaker 1>learn and under what conditions they </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn.</v>

569
00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:08.603
<v Speaker 1>And we understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say to some degree what the </v>

570
00:28:12.661 --> 00:28:15.900
<v Speaker 1>fundamental motivations and emotions are</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

571
00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:18.870
<v Speaker 1>those are not scientific categories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivations and emotions,</v>

572
00:28:18.871 --> 00:28:21.420
<v Speaker 1>their linguistic categories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what we're stuck with.</v>

573
00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:22.780
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we,</v>

574
00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:26.040
<v Speaker 1>we know a fair bit about their </v>
<v Speaker 1>underlying neuro biological basis.</v>

575
00:28:26.041 --> 00:28:26.874
<v Speaker 1>And I want to take you through that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some detail because for a bunch of </v>

576
00:28:29.941 --> 00:28:30.774
<v Speaker 1>reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because it provides a nice </v>

577
00:28:32.551 --> 00:28:33.384
<v Speaker 1>scientific underpinning to a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypotheses and precept positions of the </v>

578
00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:39.150
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalysis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

579
00:28:39.151 --> 00:28:40.050
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

580
00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:43.020
<v Speaker 1>Freud hypothesized the existence of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>end.</v>

581
00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:47.430
<v Speaker 1>Now there is no way I had in your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't really matter because the</v>

582
00:28:47.431 --> 00:28:48.630
<v Speaker 1>ID,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ID of the,</v>

583
00:28:48.631 --> 00:28:51.000
<v Speaker 1>it is a functional category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a tool.</v>

584
00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:54.090
<v Speaker 1>But there are lots of Ed like structures</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your brain,</v>

585
00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:55.463
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of them in particular is the </v>

586
00:28:56.431 --> 00:29:00.360
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus and not thing like human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings like to think that they're really</v>

587
00:29:00.361 --> 00:29:02.400
<v Speaker 1>impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cortical cap is the thing that's,</v>

588
00:29:02.401 --> 00:29:03.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in charge of things.</v>

589
00:29:03.691 --> 00:29:04.524
<v Speaker 1>But your hypothalamus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is this little tiny thing that </v>

590
00:29:06.781 --> 00:29:10.950
<v Speaker 1>sits at the top of your spinal cord man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what's running you.</v>

591
00:29:11.610 --> 00:29:16.020
<v Speaker 1>And let you know as long as you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>hungry or not angry or not chasing after</v>

592
00:29:16.021 --> 00:29:19.500
<v Speaker 1>sexual excitement and not gambling and </v>
<v Speaker 1>not addicted.</v>

593
00:29:19.501 --> 00:29:23.940
<v Speaker 1>So as long as you're completely well fed</v>
<v Speaker 1>and warm and comfortable,</v>

594
00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:27.750
<v Speaker 1>then you can think and you're more or </v>
<v Speaker 1>less in control.</v>

595
00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:30.210
<v Speaker 1>But as soon as any of those things go </v>
<v Speaker 1>astray,</v>

596
00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:32.190
<v Speaker 1>it's subcortical all the way.</v>

597
00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:33.660
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can see this,</v>

598
00:29:33.661 --> 00:29:36.360
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in conditions like Anorexia,</v>

599
00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:37.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because Anorexia,</v>

600
00:29:37.501 --> 00:29:41.530
<v Speaker 1>you can think of Anorexia as a war </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the cortex and the hypothalamus.</v>

601
00:29:41.531 --> 00:29:42.460
<v Speaker 1>And I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

602
00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:46.900
<v Speaker 1>the only time the cortex wins is when </v>
<v Speaker 1>the anorexic dies.</v>

603
00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:48.153
<v Speaker 1>Because other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the hypothalamus that wins all the </v>

604
00:29:49.661 --> 00:29:50.494
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why anorexics cannot stop </v>

605
00:29:51.881 --> 00:29:53.830
<v Speaker 1>themselves from Benji.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

606
00:29:53.831 --> 00:29:54.664
<v Speaker 1>So they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll cut their body weight down to </v>

607
00:29:55.931 --> 00:29:59.710
<v Speaker 1>say 75% of what it should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's hard.</v>

608
00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:00.573
<v Speaker 1>Like you really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not easy to starve yourself like </v>

609
00:30:03.371 --> 00:30:05.620
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they'll still binge like mad,</v>

610
00:30:05.621 --> 00:30:07.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and need a whole gallon of ice cream and</v>

611
00:30:07.261 --> 00:30:09.970
<v Speaker 1>two bags of bread and they can't stop </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

612
00:30:09.971 --> 00:30:10.804
<v Speaker 1>And that's because your hypothalamus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would rather you didn't starve to </v>

613
00:30:12.971 --> 00:30:14.920
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're not paying attention,</v>

614
00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:16.383
<v Speaker 1>if you're not on top of the game or </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe if you've been hurt recently and </v>

615
00:30:19.151 --> 00:30:21.280
<v Speaker 1>so your resources or your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

616
00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:22.593
<v Speaker 1>what would you say you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the negative emotion has been </v>

617
00:30:24.821 --> 00:30:26.680
<v Speaker 1>interfering with your cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity.</v>

618
00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:28.960
<v Speaker 1>The hypothalamus will come up and grab </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and say,</v>

619
00:30:28.961 --> 00:30:29.830
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're hungry.</v>

620
00:30:29.831 --> 00:30:32.320
<v Speaker 1>And it's off to the fridge with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

621
00:30:32.321 --> 00:30:33.154
<v Speaker 1>so two in the morning you're going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating everything in there in a kind of </v>

622
00:30:36.081 --> 00:30:37.900
<v Speaker 1>a daze and you'll snap out of that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

623
00:30:37.901 --> 00:30:39.160
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell was that?</v>

624
00:30:39.161 --> 00:30:41.770
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's the end folks.</v>

625
00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:45.430
<v Speaker 1>And it's no trivial thing and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good thing too because if it didn't tell</v>

626
00:30:45.431 --> 00:30:49.480
<v Speaker 1>you what to do all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like think about how foolish you are.</v>

627
00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:51.820
<v Speaker 1>If you had to breathe voluntarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

628
00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:53.860
<v Speaker 1>how many days do you think you'd go </v>
<v Speaker 1>through?</v>

629
00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:54.803
<v Speaker 1>It's like you wake up one day and an </v>
<v Speaker 1>hour later you'd forget to breathe and </v>

630
00:30:57.791 --> 00:31:00.100
<v Speaker 1>then you'd be dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like your,</v>

631
00:31:00.101 --> 00:31:00.934
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain doesn't let you do anything </v>

632
00:31:02.621 --> 00:31:03.454
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes care of all that in the </v>

633
00:31:05.771 --> 00:31:06.700
<v Speaker 1>background,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

634
00:31:06.701 --> 00:31:08.080
<v Speaker 1>cause you're just not that smart.</v>

635
00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:09.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know how to digest things.</v>

636
00:31:09.791 --> 00:31:10.624
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you actually don't know how you walk </v>

637
00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:17.430
<v Speaker 1>even though you can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there are fundamental subsystem,</v>

638
00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:20.110
<v Speaker 1>some of them that aren't even conscious </v>
<v Speaker 1>weirdly enough,</v>

639
00:31:20.111 --> 00:31:20.944
<v Speaker 1>even though they're neurological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing all the heavy lifting and </v>

640
00:31:23.261 --> 00:31:24.094
<v Speaker 1>like your cortex is along there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's along for the ride and some </v>

641
00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:28.630
<v Speaker 1>sanction and sort of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in control.</v>

642
00:31:28.631 --> 00:31:30.050
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

643
00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:32.260
<v Speaker 1>not really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

644
00:31:32.261 --> 00:31:33.094
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to talk a fair bit about </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental brain structures and the </v>

645
00:31:35.771 --> 00:31:39.390
<v Speaker 1>function of those structures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause I liked functional neuroanatomy.</v>

646
00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:41.410
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to know just what the brain</v>

647
00:31:41.411 --> 00:31:42.244
<v Speaker 1>is made out of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I want to know what all the parts </v>

648
00:31:43.241 --> 00:31:47.200
<v Speaker 1>are doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's difficult papers in their</v>

649
00:31:47.201 --> 00:31:51.100
<v Speaker 1>swans and that's a hard paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the grit paper by gray,</v>

650
00:31:51.790 --> 00:31:52.623
<v Speaker 1>those are papers that were written by I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think genius level neuropsychologists </v>

651
00:31:56.351 --> 00:31:57.184
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they put their whole life's work into a </v>

652
00:31:59.261 --> 00:32:01.240
<v Speaker 1>paper and so you know you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pick it up,</v>

653
00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:02.081
<v Speaker 1>you're going to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

654
00:32:02.081 --> 00:32:02.800
<v Speaker 1>this is hard.</v>

655
00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:03.730
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

656
00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:06.970
<v Speaker 1>some genius spent 30 years writing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be hard.</v>

657
00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:11.560
<v Speaker 1>But there are so informative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're worth the struggle if,</v>

658
00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:14.500
<v Speaker 1>if that's the sort of thing you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>struggle with.</v>

659
00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:15.813
<v Speaker 1>So that's the biological end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the psychometric ended </v>

660
00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:19.750
<v Speaker 1>site,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychometrics,</v>

661
00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:23.290
<v Speaker 1>very unpopular field of psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even among psychologists.</v>

662
00:32:23.291 --> 00:32:26.320
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychometric nutritions,</v>

663
00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:27.393
<v Speaker 1>I guess have actually discovered things </v>
<v Speaker 1>and people hate what they've discovered </v>

664
00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:32.740
<v Speaker 1>and no wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

665
00:32:32.741 --> 00:32:35.850
<v Speaker 1>it was people who do psychometrics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>engineers actually who had,</v>

666
00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:38.710
<v Speaker 1>who entered psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who discovered intelligence,</v>

667
00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:44.290
<v Speaker 1>technical psychometric intelligence Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people will tell you there's lots of</v>

668
00:32:44.361 --> 00:32:46.190
<v Speaker 1>kinds of intelligence like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

669
00:32:46.191 --> 00:32:48.440
<v Speaker 1>there aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's wrong.</v>

670
00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:49.663
<v Speaker 1>And it's wrong in this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The statistics that psychologists use </v>

671
00:32:53.781 --> 00:32:56.000
<v Speaker 1>were invented by the people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovered Iq.</v>

672
00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:57.733
<v Speaker 1>And that means every single thing that a</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologist has ever claimed that's </v>

673
00:33:00.651 --> 00:33:05.480
<v Speaker 1>been verified in some way using some </v>
<v Speaker 1>statistical process has been verified,</v>

674
00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:07.730
<v Speaker 1>verified,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same way that Iq was verified.</v>

675
00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:09.013
<v Speaker 1>And so you don't get to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the Iq stuff's invalid without </v>

676
00:33:11.721 --> 00:33:15.020
<v Speaker 1>saying all of psychology and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>other fields is invalid too because it's</v>

677
00:33:15.021 --> 00:33:15.854
<v Speaker 1>the same methods of proof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's even worse than that because </v>

678
00:33:18.291 --> 00:33:20.900
<v Speaker 1>like the relationship between Iq and </v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

679
00:33:20.901 --> 00:33:21.734
<v Speaker 1>success is way stronger than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship between almost any other </v>

680
00:33:24.921 --> 00:33:28.280
<v Speaker 1>psychological phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And almost anything else.</v>

681
00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:31.070
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for you guys even know,</v>

682
00:33:31.790 --> 00:33:32.623
<v Speaker 1>you know you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're all far above average in </v>

683
00:33:34.091 --> 00:33:34.924
<v Speaker 1>intelligence because otherwise you </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be here like at least 85th </v>

684
00:33:37.341 --> 00:33:38.174
<v Speaker 1>percentile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's something to think about </v>

685
00:33:39.391 --> 00:33:43.340
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of that is determined by </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological factors and also a huge chunk</v>

686
00:33:43.341 --> 00:33:45.680
<v Speaker 1>of the reason that you're here is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

687
00:33:45.681 --> 00:33:46.514
<v Speaker 1>you one part of the genetic lottery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like hurray for you and no one's </v>

688
00:33:49.331 --> 00:33:51.830
<v Speaker 1>screwed it up too badly as you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>growing up,</v>

689
00:33:52.390 --> 00:33:54.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even among you guys,</v>

690
00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:54.913
<v Speaker 1>that correlation between your </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence and your and your grade </v>

691
00:33:57.951 --> 00:34:01.040
<v Speaker 1>point average is quite high even though </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a truncated sample,</v>

692
00:34:01.041 --> 00:34:01.250
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

693
00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:02.083
<v Speaker 1>Cause you're all pretty bright and even </v>
<v Speaker 1>though there's a lot of error in the </v>

694
00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:09.020
<v Speaker 1>grade measurement system because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't only index intelligence,</v>

695
00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:12.620
<v Speaker 1>it's still very powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the one,</v>

696
00:34:12.621 --> 00:34:13.490
<v Speaker 1>the peep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

697
00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:17.660
<v Speaker 1>if you controlled for conscientious and </v>
<v Speaker 1>other elements of personality,</v>

698
00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:20.360
<v Speaker 1>which you can do statistically in 20 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

699
00:34:20.361 --> 00:34:21.194
<v Speaker 1>the peep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 10% of the people in this room who </v>

700
00:34:22.791 --> 00:34:25.910
<v Speaker 1>have the highest Iq is we'll have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>highest income virtually.</v>

701
00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:27.110
<v Speaker 1>Certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

702
00:34:27.111 --> 00:34:29.180
<v Speaker 1>unless some terrible thing happens to </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

703
00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:30.253
<v Speaker 1>you can overcome it to some degree if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're really hardworking cause then </v>

704
00:34:33.201 --> 00:34:34.550
<v Speaker 1>that's conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

705
00:34:34.551 --> 00:34:35.384
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's also a trait which seems to </v>

706
00:34:36.291 --> 00:34:39.560
<v Speaker 1>have quite a heavy biological loading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So well,</v>

707
00:34:39.561 --> 00:34:43.220
<v Speaker 1>so that's the sort of thing that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>hate about psychometricians because they</v>

708
00:34:43.221 --> 00:34:46.880
<v Speaker 1>come up with these facts and there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>facts that are really dismal.</v>

709
00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:49.160
<v Speaker 1>And I can give you an example.</v>

710
00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:49.993
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you guys all have an Iq of over 150 </v>

711
00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:54.703
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking a hundred makes you </v>
<v Speaker 1>about as smart as the typical high </v>

712
00:34:57.471 --> 00:34:59.420
<v Speaker 1>school rapping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

713
00:34:59.421 --> 00:35:04.421
<v Speaker 1>115 that's kind of the low end for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for managing the rigors of a,</v>

714
00:35:04.890 --> 00:35:08.300
<v Speaker 1>a fairly high end university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

715
00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:10.430
<v Speaker 1>one 15 you're still going to have a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of trouble.</v>

716
00:35:10.431 --> 00:35:12.680
<v Speaker 1>Are you going to have to work like mad?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

717
00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:17.770
<v Speaker 1>but okay so 150 now that's one standard </v>
<v Speaker 1>deviation above the mean.</v>

718
00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:22.580
<v Speaker 1>One standard deviation below the mean is</v>
<v Speaker 1>an Iq of 85.</v>

719
00:35:22.581 --> 00:35:23.414
<v Speaker 1>Now there's just as many people out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there in the world who have an Iq of 85 </v>

720
00:35:25.971 --> 00:35:28.730
<v Speaker 1>as there are people who are able to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>to college.</v>

721
00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:31.010
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you think,</v>

722
00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:37.010
<v Speaker 1>what can you do if you have an Iq of 85 </v>
<v Speaker 1>and well,</v>

723
00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:38.123
<v Speaker 1>one answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the u s army has been doing </v>

724
00:35:39.421 --> 00:35:42.150
<v Speaker 1>psychometric testing for a hundred and </v>
<v Speaker 1>some years,</v>

725
00:35:42.210 --> 00:35:43.650
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a whole bunch of reasons.</v>

726
00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:45.360
<v Speaker 1>But they've done a lot of the basic </v>
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>

727
00:35:45.361 --> 00:35:46.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

728
00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:48.233
<v Speaker 1>one thing about the u s army is they </v>
<v Speaker 1>like to have recruits and you can </v>

729
00:35:51.871 --> 00:35:52.704
<v Speaker 1>understand why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because do you really want to go off </v>

730
00:35:54.121 --> 00:35:56.910
<v Speaker 1>somewhere and get shot?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is generally no.</v>

731
00:35:56.911 --> 00:36:00.390
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like there were people </v>
<v Speaker 1>lining up to get into the army.</v>

732
00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:02.670
<v Speaker 1>Even in peace time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to get people.</v>

733
00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:06.690
<v Speaker 1>And also the Americans have used the u s</v>
<v Speaker 1>army as a,</v>

734
00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:08.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine you have a,</v>

735
00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:10.740
<v Speaker 1>an underclass of people who aren't doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>very well,</v>

736
00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:13.500
<v Speaker 1>which is the case in every society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you want to boost.</v>

737
00:36:13.501 --> 00:36:14.940
<v Speaker 1>Some of them up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

738
00:36:14.941 --> 00:36:17.250
<v Speaker 1>into something resembling the middle </v>
<v Speaker 1>class.</v>

739
00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:18.233
<v Speaker 1>You can do that fairly effectively by </v>
<v Speaker 1>inducting new young men in particular </v>

740
00:36:21.151 --> 00:36:22.980
<v Speaker 1>into the army because they get some </v>
<v Speaker 1>training,</v>

741
00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:24.053
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they get some discipline and maybe </v>

742
00:36:24.991 --> 00:36:26.970
<v Speaker 1>they can kinda clamber up into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle class.</v>

743
00:36:26.970 --> 00:36:31.970
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a lot of policy reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A why the American army or enforces want</v>

744
00:36:32.611 --> 00:36:34.500
<v Speaker 1>people and be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

745
00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:37.170
<v Speaker 1>just to be in the army,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also for social reasons,</v>

746
00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:38.273
<v Speaker 1>positive social reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're not likely not to let you in </v>

747
00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:45.390
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the consequence of a hundred years of Iq</v>

748
00:36:45.391 --> 00:36:49.200
<v Speaker 1>testing was the PR was the establishment</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a law in the United States.</v>

749
00:36:49.201 --> 00:36:53.490
<v Speaker 1>You cannot induct anyone into the army,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cannot accept them into the army.</v>

750
00:36:53.491 --> 00:36:58.020
<v Speaker 1>If they have an Iq of less than 82 </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's 10% of the population.</v>

751
00:36:59.100 --> 00:36:59.933
<v Speaker 1>So you think about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means one person in 10 cannot do </v>

752
00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:07.880
<v Speaker 1>anything that is a positive value in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization.</v>

753
00:37:08.881 --> 00:37:09.714
<v Speaker 1>It's rather complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not more complex than other </v>

754
00:37:11.761 --> 00:37:14.730
<v Speaker 1>organizations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's desperate for people,</v>

755
00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:17.910
<v Speaker 1>not thing they an offer has positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>value.</v>

756
00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:21.510
<v Speaker 1>It's worse to have them in the army than</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to have them there at all.</v>

757
00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:23.003
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you know that that's a terrible way </v>

758
00:37:24.331 --> 00:37:25.310
<v Speaker 1>of putting it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's an,</v>

759
00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:26.163
<v Speaker 1>it's a horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a horrible statistic because it </v>

760
00:37:29.101 --> 00:37:30.000
<v Speaker 1>also means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

761
00:37:30.001 --> 00:37:34.110
<v Speaker 1>if you think about the army as roughly </v>
<v Speaker 1>equivalent to the world in some sense in</v>

762
00:37:34.111 --> 00:37:34.944
<v Speaker 1>terms of its complexity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means that there's 10% of the </v>

763
00:37:37.861 --> 00:37:42.240
<v Speaker 1>population who just cannot really exist </v>
<v Speaker 1>well in a complex cognitive society.</v>

764
00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:44.371
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you might say,</v>

765
00:37:44.371 --> 00:37:45.120
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

766
00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:47.190
<v Speaker 1>something should be done about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like good luck.</v>

767
00:37:47.191 --> 00:37:49.890
<v Speaker 1>People had been trying to do something </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that for a very long time.</v>

768
00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:51.413
<v Speaker 1>There's been billions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if not trillions of dollars poured into </v>

769
00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:58.500
<v Speaker 1>attempts to do cognitive remediation in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States.</v>

770
00:37:58.530 --> 00:37:59.363
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to mention that we actually have an </v>

771
00:38:00.631 --> 00:38:03.990
<v Speaker 1>education system and the cool is </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually to make people smarter.</v>

772
00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:07.830
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to talk a lot about </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychometrics.</v>

773
00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:09.263
<v Speaker 1>And the thing about the psychometricians</v>
<v Speaker 1>is they're basically brute force status </v>

774
00:38:11.801 --> 00:38:14.150
<v Speaker 1>Titian's in some ways they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>atheoretical,</v>

775
00:38:14.770 --> 00:38:15.603
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they use computer power roughly </v>

776
00:38:17.461 --> 00:38:18.294
<v Speaker 1>speaking and advanced statistical </v>
<v Speaker 1>techniques to look at large data sets </v>

777
00:38:21.091 --> 00:38:22.320
<v Speaker 1>and extract out patterns.</v>

778
00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:23.580
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

779
00:38:23.581 --> 00:38:25.920
<v Speaker 1>I hated the big five when I first came </v>
<v Speaker 1>on it.</v>

780
00:38:25.921 --> 00:38:26.790
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

781
00:38:26.791 --> 00:38:29.580
<v Speaker 1>this is boring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's no theory behind it.</v>

782
00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:30.533
<v Speaker 1>It's not prescriptive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not interested in any literary </v>

783
00:38:33.091 --> 00:38:35.130
<v Speaker 1>manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it doesn't have a good story.</v>

784
00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:36.970
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it came out of,</v>

785
00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:40.360
<v Speaker 1>it's so dry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

786
00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:42.760
<v Speaker 1>it works and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

787
00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:48.160
<v Speaker 1>that's how it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to spend a lot of time on</v>

788
00:38:48.161 --> 00:38:48.994
<v Speaker 1>psychometrics and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my lab two is done if they're a bit of </v>

789
00:38:51.581 --> 00:38:54.880
<v Speaker 1>work over the last 10 years elaborating </v>
<v Speaker 1>out the big five model.</v>

790
00:38:54.881 --> 00:38:55.714
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things we'll talk about is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big 10 model and what it does </v>

791
00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:01.840
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is break each of the five into two,</v>

792
00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:04.480
<v Speaker 1>we call them aspects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're pretty interesting.</v>

793
00:39:04.481 --> 00:39:06.340
<v Speaker 1>Like they predict political belief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

794
00:39:06.341 --> 00:39:07.174
<v Speaker 1>quite nicely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So conservatives tend to be more </v>

795
00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:10.863
<v Speaker 1>orderly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is part of conscientiousness and </v>

796
00:39:12.491 --> 00:39:14.410
<v Speaker 1>less creative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less open.</v>

797
00:39:14.770 --> 00:39:17.680
<v Speaker 1>And Liberals tend to be more open and </v>
<v Speaker 1>less conscientious,</v>

798
00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:18.633
<v Speaker 1>which a cynic would say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why they're so into income </v>

799
00:39:20.441 --> 00:39:22.840
<v Speaker 1>redistribution because they actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't work.</v>

800
00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:24.213
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the conservatives work like mad and the </v>

801
00:39:25.691 --> 00:39:26.710
<v Speaker 1>liberals say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

802
00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:28.870
<v Speaker 1>how about some of that money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

803
00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:31.060
<v Speaker 1>the system's unfair and the conservative</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

804
00:39:31.061 --> 00:39:33.640
<v Speaker 1>well no we worked hard and we're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>giving you any.</v>

805
00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:37.540
<v Speaker 1>Well you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they both have flaws in their theories,</v>

806
00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:40.000
<v Speaker 1>but liberals by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make very good entrepreneurs.</v>

807
00:39:40.090 --> 00:39:40.923
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

808
00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:41.793
<v Speaker 1>let me rephrase that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most entrepreneurs are liberal in their </v>

809
00:39:44.921 --> 00:39:48.370
<v Speaker 1>political outlook and that's because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're high in openness.</v>

810
00:39:48.371 --> 00:39:49.204
<v Speaker 1>So the way it really seems to work is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that liberal minded people start </v>

811
00:39:52.331 --> 00:39:57.220
<v Speaker 1>businesses and conservatives run them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're necessary for one another.</v>

812
00:39:57.640 --> 00:39:59.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well cause the liberals being open,</v>

813
00:39:59.381 --> 00:40:00.880
<v Speaker 1>they're off to the next idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

814
00:40:01.330 --> 00:40:03.370
<v Speaker 1>And they don't want to attend to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>damn details.</v>

815
00:40:03.370 --> 00:40:05.650
<v Speaker 1>They get bored by that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not particularly orderly,</v>

816
00:40:05.651 --> 00:40:06.484
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But once you've established a process </v>

817
00:40:08.231 --> 00:40:09.064
<v Speaker 1>and it works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need someone to watch to make sure </v>

818
00:40:10.571 --> 00:40:11.404
<v Speaker 1>the process keeps working well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not very interesting if you're a </v>

819
00:40:13.481 --> 00:40:15.040
<v Speaker 1>creative person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

820
00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:16.660
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

821
00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:23.310
<v Speaker 1>that's basically that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the course.</v>

822
00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:28.400
<v Speaker 1>So now at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I think what I'll do now is I'm going</v>

823
00:40:32.371 --> 00:40:33.204
<v Speaker 1>to tell you a story and you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>think it has absolutely nothing to do </v>

824
00:40:35.851 --> 00:40:39.540
<v Speaker 1>with what we've been talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's okay.</v>

825
00:40:41.010 --> 00:40:45.010
<v Speaker 1>That's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I picked this weird</v>

826
00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:48.640
<v Speaker 1>picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

827
00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:49.993
<v Speaker 1>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a picture of Jonah Biblical </v>

828
00:40:52.661 --> 00:40:55.600
<v Speaker 1>character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So 2,500 year old story.</v>

829
00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:56.853
<v Speaker 1>So that's a pretty old story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And generally if a story is 2,500 years </v>

830
00:41:00.431 --> 00:41:02.230
<v Speaker 1>old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot older than that.</v>

831
00:41:02.410 --> 00:41:03.243
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just happened to be written down </v>

832
00:41:04.031 --> 00:41:05.980
<v Speaker 1>2,500 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

833
00:41:05.981 --> 00:41:10.270
<v Speaker 1>that long ago it wasn't like there were </v>
<v Speaker 1>novels and books and that you could find</v>

834
00:41:10.271 --> 00:41:11.920
<v Speaker 1>50 different stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

835
00:41:11.921 --> 00:41:12.880
<v Speaker 1>at your fingertips.</v>

836
00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:13.713
<v Speaker 1>There were a few stories and everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>knew them and God only knows how long </v>

837
00:41:16.301 --> 00:41:17.830
<v Speaker 1>they'd been around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was a very,</v>

838
00:41:17.831 --> 00:41:18.581
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

839
00:41:18.581 --> 00:41:19.414
<v Speaker 1>very long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this was written down 2,500 years </v>

840
00:41:22.091 --> 00:41:22.924
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we don't really have any idea how </v>

841
00:41:24.161 --> 00:41:28.960
<v Speaker 1>old it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in some sense it's almost infinitely</v>

842
00:41:28.961 --> 00:41:31.630
<v Speaker 1>old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least on any human scale.</v>

843
00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:36.000
<v Speaker 1>Now you see this picture and what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>see is this thing that,</v>

844
00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:37.033
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's a mid evil idea of a whale is </v>

845
00:41:40.131 --> 00:41:41.370
<v Speaker 1>what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

846
00:41:41.371 --> 00:41:42.204
<v Speaker 1>when you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that isn't really what a way it </v>

847
00:41:43.041 --> 00:41:45.830
<v Speaker 1>looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's kind of right.</v>

848
00:41:45.831 --> 00:41:48.830
<v Speaker 1>But a medieval Wale wasn't the whale </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we have.</v>

849
00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:51.830
<v Speaker 1>Like whale in medieval times meant </v>
<v Speaker 1>large,</v>

850
00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:55.070
<v Speaker 1>terrifying underwater thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

851
00:41:55.071 --> 00:41:55.904
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe that was maybe a giant </v>
<v Speaker 1>squid was the whale and the whale was a </v>

852
00:41:59.211 --> 00:42:01.190
<v Speaker 1>whale in the shark was a whale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

853
00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:05.130
<v Speaker 1>the category is not the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that kind of accounts for the,</v>

854
00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:07.153
<v Speaker 1>that in pure ignorance is what accounts </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the kind of strange mythologized </v>

855
00:42:11.121 --> 00:42:11.954
<v Speaker 1>representation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's still a representation of </v>

856
00:42:13.971 --> 00:42:15.500
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a little generalized.</v>

857
00:42:15.530 --> 00:42:20.210
<v Speaker 1>Now what he's doing is vomiting Jonah up</v>
<v Speaker 1>onto dry land.</v>

858
00:42:20.690 --> 00:42:22.430
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you think that's,</v>

859
00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:25.040
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty damn weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of you have Seen Pinocchio?</v>

860
00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:27.590
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

861
00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:31.250
<v Speaker 1>how many of you haven't really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you haven't Seen Pinocchio?</v>

862
00:42:31.251 --> 00:42:33.100
<v Speaker 1>What kind of parents did you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyways?</v>

863
00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:38.090
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you remember in Pinocchio Pinocchio</v>

864
00:42:38.091 --> 00:42:38.924
<v Speaker 1>was father is stuck in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>La and then Pinocchio has to go down </v>

865
00:42:40.941 --> 00:42:41.774
<v Speaker 1>there and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

866
00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:43.033
<v Speaker 1>and rescue him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things you didn't notice </v>

867
00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:47.960
<v Speaker 1>when you were watching Pinocchio is just</v>
<v Speaker 1>how daft that is.</v>

868
00:42:47.961 --> 00:42:48.794
<v Speaker 1>There you are sitting there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're watching a puppet go down into </v>

869
00:42:52.431 --> 00:42:55.610
<v Speaker 1>the ocean to rescue his father from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>whale.</v>

870
00:42:56.210 --> 00:42:57.140
<v Speaker 1>And you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>

871
00:42:57.180 --> 00:42:58.580
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

872
00:43:00.050 --> 00:43:01.370
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's interesting.</v>

873
00:43:01.371 --> 00:43:02.420
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

874
00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:06.530
<v Speaker 1>Why does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why does that make sense?</v>

875
00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:09.280
<v Speaker 1>Cause it doesn't make any sense but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

876
00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:10.970
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see that's a,</v>

877
00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:14.180
<v Speaker 1>that's a good example of the grip of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>architectural idea.</v>

878
00:43:14.690 --> 00:43:15.523
<v Speaker 1>Cause in archetipal ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very deep and old idea that makes </v>

879
00:43:18.441 --> 00:43:20.780
<v Speaker 1>sense to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though if someone points out to you</v>

880
00:43:20.781 --> 00:43:21.614
<v Speaker 1>that you believe it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you more or less do while you're </v>

881
00:43:23.391 --> 00:43:25.190
<v Speaker 1>watching the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

882
00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:27.090
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really weird that I believe that.</v>

883
00:43:27.090 --> 00:43:27.960
<v Speaker 1>Just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

884
00:43:28.690 --> 00:43:29.523
<v Speaker 1>that isn't a puppet going down into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ocean to rescue his father from a whale </v>

885
00:43:33.531 --> 00:43:34.630
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just so you know it,</v>

886
00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:35.593
<v Speaker 1>it's a drawing of a puppet going down </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the ocean to rescue as far from a </v>

887
00:43:38.361 --> 00:43:41.210
<v Speaker 1>whale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like divorced from reality,</v>

888
00:43:41.211 --> 00:43:45.560
<v Speaker 1>my life in all sorts of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what's so interesting is you go into</v>

889
00:43:45.561 --> 00:43:47.750
<v Speaker 1>the theater and watch something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there.</v>

890
00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:49.490
<v Speaker 1>If someone taps you on the shoulder and </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

891
00:43:49.491 --> 00:43:50.900
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know what you're doing?</v>

892
00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:52.070
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

893
00:43:52.070 --> 00:43:54.140
<v Speaker 1>why don't you shut up and let me watch </v>
<v Speaker 1>the movie?</v>

894
00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:55.760
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't notice.</v>

895
00:43:55.761 --> 00:43:56.594
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very peculiar and very peculiar </v>

896
00:43:58.041 --> 00:44:01.040
<v Speaker 1>thing sitting here watching this and not</v>
<v Speaker 1>noticing how strange I am,</v>

897
00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:02.450
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

898
00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:03.553
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's partly why I'm going to tell you </v>

899
00:44:05.091 --> 00:44:08.780
<v Speaker 1>this story because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's true,</v>

900
00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:11.450
<v Speaker 1>even though it isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

901
00:44:11.450 --> 00:44:12.081
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

902
00:44:12.081 --> 00:44:13.910
<v Speaker 1>that's a funny thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a very,</v>

903
00:44:13.911 --> 00:44:18.500
<v Speaker 1>very strange professor at the University</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Alberta.</v>

904
00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:21.320
<v Speaker 1>He died a few years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got in a bus,</v>

905
00:44:21.350 --> 00:44:22.183
<v Speaker 1>I think it was in Winnipeg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he never got off the bus and no one </v>

906
00:44:23.751 --> 00:44:26.240
<v Speaker 1>ever saw him again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he had,</v>

907
00:44:26.241 --> 00:44:29.360
<v Speaker 1>he'd been a prison psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he worked in the maximum security prison</v>

908
00:44:29.361 --> 00:44:32.640
<v Speaker 1>and University of Alberta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So who maybe he met one of his old</v>

909
00:44:34.170 --> 00:44:35.070
<v Speaker 1>clients,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

910
00:44:35.071 --> 00:44:36.900
<v Speaker 1>it's possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's very strange,</v>

911
00:44:36.901 --> 00:44:38.120
<v Speaker 1>very strange ending.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

912
00:44:38.130 --> 00:44:39.460
<v Speaker 1>one time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

913
00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:41.670
<v Speaker 1>we are talking about fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

914
00:44:41.671 --> 00:44:42.930
<v Speaker 1>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

915
00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:46.500
<v Speaker 1>he said fiction is a lie that can tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>you the truth.</v>

916
00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:49.710
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very interesting way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about it.</v>

917
00:44:49.711 --> 00:44:50.544
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you read fiction and you know </v>

918
00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:54.503
<v Speaker 1>it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not obviously because it's not </v>

919
00:44:56.761 --> 00:44:59.130
<v Speaker 1>really about a thing that actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened,</v>

920
00:44:59.610 --> 00:45:02.850
<v Speaker 1>but it's more than that some ways </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if it's good fiction,</v>

921
00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:05.790
<v Speaker 1>it's about a whole bunch of things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen sort of like that.</v>

922
00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:08.310
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a distillation,</v>

923
00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:12.250
<v Speaker 1>it's like someone tells you a long story</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you know,</v>

924
00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:13.060
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

925
00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:16.530
<v Speaker 1>you talked to your partner and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>asked you what was that all about?</v>

926
00:45:16.531 --> 00:45:18.660
<v Speaker 1>And then you tell them in two sentences </v>
<v Speaker 1>what it was about.</v>

927
00:45:18.661 --> 00:45:20.970
<v Speaker 1>You boil it down to the just right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

928
00:45:20.971 --> 00:45:23.850
<v Speaker 1>a really good story is the gist of </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

929
00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:28.500
<v Speaker 1>And some of the really old stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the really weird ones like Jonah and the</v>

930
00:45:28.501 --> 00:45:30.830
<v Speaker 1>whale for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which as I said is,</v>

931
00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:31.753
<v Speaker 1>is told to some degree in the story of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio there the gist of a lot of </v>

932
00:45:35.071 --> 00:45:38.880
<v Speaker 1>things and people have been boiling </v>
<v Speaker 1>those damn stories down for,</v>

933
00:45:39.390 --> 00:45:40.500
<v Speaker 1>for a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

934
00:45:40.501 --> 00:45:41.281
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

935
00:45:41.281 --> 00:45:44.100
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very long period of time.</v>

936
00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:47.130
<v Speaker 1>Thousands of people over thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

937
00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:49.830
<v Speaker 1>And they come up with these weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories that people remember</v>

938
00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:52.500
<v Speaker 1>and then people think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

939
00:45:52.501 --> 00:45:53.311
<v Speaker 1>they're real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

940
00:45:53.311 --> 00:45:53.911
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are,</v>

941
00:45:53.911 --> 00:45:54.744
<v Speaker 1>but they're not real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way a scientific story is real to </v>

942
00:45:56.370 --> 00:45:58.020
<v Speaker 1>different kinds of real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's,</v>

943
00:45:58.021 --> 00:45:59.250
<v Speaker 1>here's the story of Jonah.</v>

944
00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:04.573
<v Speaker 1>So it's an old Jewish story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's probably a very intimate in in </v>

945
00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:10.660
<v Speaker 1>the Qur'an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know that variant.</v>

946
00:46:10.661 --> 00:46:12.120
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe there isn't.</v>

947
00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:16.930
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jonah lives in 500 BC and uh,</v>

948
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:19.980
<v Speaker 1>God has a chat with them one day and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

949
00:46:19.981 --> 00:46:21.240
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jonah there,</v>

950
00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:22.620
<v Speaker 1>there's this city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nineveh,</v>

951
00:46:22.621 --> 00:46:24.720
<v Speaker 1>and the people there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

952
00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:26.153
<v Speaker 1>they're really not on the straight and </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrow and things are going to go to </v>

953
00:46:28.711 --> 00:46:32.940
<v Speaker 1>hell in a handbasket very rapidly if </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone doesn't do something about that.</v>

954
00:46:32.941 --> 00:46:35.730
<v Speaker 1>So I think that you should go to Nineveh</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you should tell the king and all the</v>

955
00:46:35.731 --> 00:46:37.530
<v Speaker 1>people that are there that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really there,</v>

956
00:46:37.770 --> 00:46:38.603
<v Speaker 1>they're just not doing the right thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Joan and being a perfectly </v>

957
00:46:40.861 --> 00:46:45.240
<v Speaker 1>intelligent person says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want me to go to a city and you want</v>

958
00:46:45.241 --> 00:46:46.074
<v Speaker 1>to go meet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't tell the king like this </v>

959
00:46:47.191 --> 00:46:50.070
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian die who has absolute power</v>
<v Speaker 1>of everything,</v>

960
00:46:50.071 --> 00:46:51.750
<v Speaker 1>that there's something wrong with what </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's doing,</v>

961
00:46:51.751 --> 00:46:53.130
<v Speaker 1>that all of the citizens are corrupt.</v>

962
00:46:53.250 --> 00:46:54.980
<v Speaker 1>That's what you want me to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

963
00:46:55.150 --> 00:46:58.170
<v Speaker 1>and Jonah says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no way I'm doing that because as</v>

964
00:46:58.171 --> 00:46:59.310
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a smart guy.</v>

965
00:46:59.670 --> 00:47:04.560
<v Speaker 1>So he runs off and he goes to this town </v>
<v Speaker 1>and as he's running off,</v>

966
00:47:04.561 --> 00:47:06.450
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he rents a boat more or less.</v>

967
00:47:06.451 --> 00:47:07.284
<v Speaker 1>And it's a big boat and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>fishermen on it and they're going to </v>

968
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:10.980
<v Speaker 1>like row him somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God can't find it,</v>

969
00:47:11.010 --> 00:47:15.060
<v Speaker 1>which is not going to be an easy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so god of course,</v>

970
00:47:15.061 --> 00:47:15.894
<v Speaker 1>can't be fooled by such relatively poor </v>
<v Speaker 1>strategic choices because he's </v>

971
00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:22.410
<v Speaker 1>omniscient and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he's out on the water,</v>

972
00:47:22.411 --> 00:47:23.700
<v Speaker 1>Jonah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's the fishermen there.</v>

973
00:47:23.701 --> 00:47:24.534
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so God calls up this big storm and the </v>

974
00:47:26.491 --> 00:47:27.324
<v Speaker 1>fishermen are shorting out about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>and because they're going to swamp the </v>

975
00:47:29.711 --> 00:47:32.290
<v Speaker 1>boat and then they're all going to die </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're not that happy about that.</v>

976
00:47:32.290 --> 00:47:36.370
<v Speaker 1>So what they decided to do is throw </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything overboard so that the boat is</v>

977
00:47:36.371 --> 00:47:37.204
<v Speaker 1>light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't help much because the </v>

978
00:47:37.931 --> 00:47:40.870
<v Speaker 1>storm gets worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then all of them start praying.</v>

979
00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:42.730
<v Speaker 1>They all have different gods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

980
00:47:42.910 --> 00:47:47.080
<v Speaker 1>it's like a little garden competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One fishermen talks to one God and other</v>

981
00:47:47.081 --> 00:47:49.630
<v Speaker 1>fishermen talks to another God and </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing's happening.</v>

982
00:47:49.631 --> 00:47:52.900
<v Speaker 1>So Jonah happens to be asleep in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hold of the ship.</v>

983
00:47:52.930 --> 00:47:56.080
<v Speaker 1>Now he's already told them that he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>been running from his God.</v>

984
00:47:56.500 --> 00:47:57.520
<v Speaker 1>And so they think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ha,</v>

985
00:47:57.580 --> 00:47:58.413
<v Speaker 1>we better go wake up Jonah because maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the guy that's causing all the </v>

986
00:48:00.881 --> 00:48:01.714
<v Speaker 1>trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they'd go down there and they wake </v>

987
00:48:02.261 --> 00:48:05.080
<v Speaker 1>him up and they ask him about his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his God.</v>

988
00:48:05.081 --> 00:48:05.914
<v Speaker 1>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well my God made the heavens and the </v>

989
00:48:07.361 --> 00:48:08.194
<v Speaker 1>earth and their gods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were doing anything that </v>

990
00:48:10.001 --> 00:48:10.834
<v Speaker 1>magnificent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're pretty freaked out about </v>

991
00:48:11.891 --> 00:48:12.100
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

992
00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:13.270
<v Speaker 1>And so they tell Joan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

993
00:48:13.271 --> 00:48:15.550
<v Speaker 1>what the hell are you running away from </v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy for?</v>

994
00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:17.740
<v Speaker 1>It's not a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Jonah says,</v>

995
00:48:17.741 --> 00:48:18.401
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

996
00:48:18.401 --> 00:48:20.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it's my fault that this storm </v>
<v Speaker 1>has come up.</v>

997
00:48:20.441 --> 00:48:23.050
<v Speaker 1>So why you just throw me over?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they say,</v>

998
00:48:23.051 --> 00:48:23.884
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't really do that because you </v>

999
00:48:24.791 --> 00:48:26.440
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't run away like that,</v>

1000
00:48:26.441 --> 00:48:29.890
<v Speaker 1>but you're not a murderer or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can't just toss you over.</v>

1001
00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:31.990
<v Speaker 1>And so they decided to try to row to </v>
<v Speaker 1>shore,</v>

1002
00:48:31.991 --> 00:48:32.824
<v Speaker 1>but God's not having any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he raises up a big storm and it's </v>

1003
00:48:35.621 --> 00:48:37.930
<v Speaker 1>getting worse and worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And finally the fishermen say,</v>

1004
00:48:37.931 --> 00:48:38.980
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1005
00:48:39.370 --> 00:48:40.203
<v Speaker 1>over you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And June is into that because he knows </v>

1006
00:48:41.861 --> 00:48:44.770
<v Speaker 1>he's a bad guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so a all swallows them.</v>

1007
00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:46.293
<v Speaker 1>Now you think that's probably not </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly right because first if a whale </v>

1008
00:48:49.370 --> 00:48:50.950
<v Speaker 1>swallowed you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you'd be dead.</v>

1009
00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:54.670
<v Speaker 1>And it was probably a shark anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like you're going to be private</v>

1010
00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:56.770
<v Speaker 1>down there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a big cavern.</v>

1011
00:48:56.771 --> 00:48:58.330
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the Pinocchio Whale,</v>

1012
00:48:58.690 --> 00:49:01.780
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's solid and there's no oxygen.</v>

1013
00:49:01.810 --> 00:49:03.790
<v Speaker 1>And so your dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that isn't what happens.</v>

1014
00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:04.653
<v Speaker 1>Joan is in the whale and he's Kinda </v>
<v Speaker 1>freaked out by this cause now he's in a </v>

1015
00:49:08.201 --> 00:49:10.390
<v Speaker 1>whale and there's a storm in God's angry</v>
<v Speaker 1>at him.</v>

1016
00:49:10.391 --> 00:49:12.940
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing he does is pray and </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell God what an idiot.</v>

1017
00:49:12.941 --> 00:49:13.720
<v Speaker 1>He isn't it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1018
00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:14.710
<v Speaker 1>he'd like to be forgiven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1019
00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:18.820
<v Speaker 1>so the whale zips up to shore and vomits</v>
<v Speaker 1>him onto the beach,</v>

1020
00:49:18.821 --> 00:49:19.654
<v Speaker 1>which is the very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very undignified mode of arriving </v>

1021
00:49:23.411 --> 00:49:24.730
<v Speaker 1>anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1022
00:49:25.630 --> 00:49:27.760
<v Speaker 1>so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the Jonah Story.</v>

1023
00:49:27.761 --> 00:49:30.490
<v Speaker 1>And then of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jonah picks himself up and he thinks he,</v>

1024
00:49:30.491 --> 00:49:31.324
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1025
00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:32.980
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't so good.</v>

1026
00:49:32.981 --> 00:49:33.814
<v Speaker 1>It was a little rough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe I'm going off to Nineveh </v>

1027
00:49:35.381 --> 00:49:36.214
<v Speaker 1>to tell the ninevites or whoever they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were that they're just not living </v>

1028
00:49:39.061 --> 00:49:42.160
<v Speaker 1>properly because that's a lot better </v>
<v Speaker 1>than making God angry,</v>

1029
00:49:42.161 --> 00:49:42.430
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1030
00:49:42.430 --> 00:49:45.640
<v Speaker 1>Cause what with the storms in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>fishermen and the whales and all that.</v>

1031
00:49:45.641 --> 00:49:46.474
<v Speaker 1>So then he goes off to Nineveh and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>tells them what's going on and it seems </v>

1032
00:49:49.871 --> 00:49:51.780
<v Speaker 1>to more or less work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1033
00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:54.940
<v Speaker 1>so that's a very interesting story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you think,</v>

1034
00:49:54.941 --> 00:49:58.540
<v Speaker 1>well how did people believe that me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one question might be,</v>

1035
00:49:58.541 --> 00:49:59.950
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you believe that story?</v>

1036
00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:03.730
<v Speaker 1>And then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>

1037
00:50:04.090 --> 00:50:04.923
<v Speaker 1>but then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe that's more complex question </v>

1038
00:50:06.551 --> 00:50:07.384
<v Speaker 1>than you might think because it turns </v>
<v Speaker 1>out that I believe the Pinocchio Story </v>

1039
00:50:10.330 --> 00:50:11.350
<v Speaker 1>and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>

1040
00:50:11.351 --> 00:50:13.660
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I would say,</v>

1041
00:50:13.690 --> 00:50:15.950
<v Speaker 1>well it kind of depends on what you mean</v>
<v Speaker 1>by bleed,</v>

1042
00:50:15.970 --> 00:50:16.803
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you watched it and while you </v>

1043
00:50:19.511 --> 00:50:20.590
<v Speaker 1>were watching it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1044
00:50:20.591 --> 00:50:22.210
<v Speaker 1>you are into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You understood it.</v>

1045
00:50:22.211 --> 00:50:24.580
<v Speaker 1>You didn't want it to be disrupted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You followed it.</v>

1046
00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:27.290
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you believe it?</v>

1047
00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:28.273
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were like a four year old skeptics </v>

1048
00:50:29.381 --> 00:50:30.380
<v Speaker 1>sitting there thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1049
00:50:30.381 --> 00:50:31.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>puppet whale.</v>

1050
00:50:31.460 --> 00:50:32.420
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't bad.</v>

1051
00:50:32.421 --> 00:50:33.254
<v Speaker 1>No you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're acting out your belief in it by </v>

1052
00:50:35.211 --> 00:50:36.044
<v Speaker 1>being engaged in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if someone taps you on the shoulder </v>

1053
00:50:38.091 --> 00:50:41.030
<v Speaker 1>and wakes you up 30 years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 years later,</v>

1054
00:50:41.031 --> 00:50:41.571
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

1055
00:50:41.571 --> 00:50:42.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1056
00:50:43.310 --> 00:50:46.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of remarkable what you believe</v>

1057
00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:48.320
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of you are star wars?</v>

1058
00:50:48.321 --> 00:50:51.200
<v Speaker 1>Like a fist unidos?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1059
00:50:51.201 --> 00:50:52.330
<v Speaker 1>you won't admit it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will you?</v>

1060
00:50:52.750 --> 00:50:54.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's lots of you in here.</v>

1061
00:50:54.771 --> 00:50:56.240
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

1062
00:50:56.241 --> 00:50:59.030
<v Speaker 1>And so that's all mythologies and told </v>
<v Speaker 1>him mythology.</v>

1063
00:50:59.031 --> 00:51:01.070
<v Speaker 1>You know that of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the person who,</v>

1064
00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:02.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was his name?</v>

1065
00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:04.220
<v Speaker 1>The guy who came up with the star wars </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea?</v>

1066
00:51:04.221 --> 00:51:07.040
<v Speaker 1>Lucas Lucas was a student of Joseph </v>
<v Speaker 1>Campbell.</v>

1067
00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:07.993
<v Speaker 1>Joseph Campbell was a psychologist slash</v>
<v Speaker 1>mythologist and the star wars stories </v>

1068
00:51:13.371 --> 00:51:16.160
<v Speaker 1>are updated mythology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like Harry Potter and all the other</v>

1069
00:51:16.161 --> 00:51:17.990
<v Speaker 1>things that capture people's </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagination.</v>

1070
00:51:17.991 --> 00:51:22.880
<v Speaker 1>So you bloody well do believe this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a reason for it to now,</v>
