1
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:15.913
<v Speaker 1>Well</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might as well start by writing down </v>

2
00:00:19.461 --> 00:00:20.294
<v Speaker 1>that url.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll show it to you again at the end of </v>

3
00:00:23.781 --> 00:00:26.660
<v Speaker 1>class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where the syllabus is.</v>

4
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:28.693
<v Speaker 1>The syllabus will tell you pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything you need to know about the </v>

5
00:00:31.371 --> 00:00:33.680
<v Speaker 1>class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

6
00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.140
<v Speaker 1>there's a text,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is it.</v>

7
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.560
<v Speaker 1>It consists of readings from a larger </v>
<v Speaker 1>text.</v>

8
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.013
<v Speaker 1>I use it because it's old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of the theorists that we're </v>

9
00:00:48.831 --> 00:00:52.400
<v Speaker 1>going to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>are also old.</v>

10
00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:53.743
<v Speaker 1>And so I found this particular text </v>
<v Speaker 1>accurate and many of the people that </v>

11
00:01:00.501 --> 00:01:04.070
<v Speaker 1>we're going to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>are very,</v>

12
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very sophisticated views of personality.</v>

13
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.633
<v Speaker 1>And I think that it does you a </v>
<v Speaker 1>disservice unless you read something </v>

14
00:01:15.891 --> 00:01:20.891
<v Speaker 1>that's sufficiently sophisticated so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you actually understand at least to</v>

15
00:01:21.111 --> 00:01:25.760
<v Speaker 1>some degree what the people that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to study,</v>

16
00:01:25.761 --> 00:01:30.650
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we might as well start,</v>

17
00:01:30.651 --> 00:01:34.340
<v Speaker 1>I suppose with a definition of </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality,</v>

18
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.320
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to define something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>that general because</v>

19
00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:42.753
<v Speaker 1>when you're speaking about human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that simple to figure out what </v>

20
00:01:46.421 --> 00:01:49.510
<v Speaker 1>constitutes personality and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>constitutes something else.</v>

21
00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.393
<v Speaker 1>But</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to hit at it from a couple </v>

22
00:01:55.751 --> 00:01:56.584
<v Speaker 1>of different perspectives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And while I'm doing so I would like you </v>

23
00:02:01.841 --> 00:02:02.950
<v Speaker 1>also have to consider</v>

24
00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.270
<v Speaker 1>the nature of what you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn.</v>

25
00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.360
<v Speaker 1>Human personality is essentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>unfathomable.</v>

26
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.633
<v Speaker 1>Human beings are unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated and we're Nastad in systems </v>

27
00:02:18.611 --> 00:02:19.444
<v Speaker 1>that are also unbelievably complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are more patterns of connections </v>

28
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.233
<v Speaker 1>between neurons in your brain than there</v>
<v Speaker 1>are subatomic particles in the universe </v>

29
00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:29.043
<v Speaker 1>by a substantial margin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can look up Gerald Edelman if you </v>

30
00:02:32.561 --> 00:02:37.561
<v Speaker 1>want to find out about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's not unreasonable.</v>

31
00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.393
<v Speaker 1>Could point out that you're the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated thing we know of by many </v>

32
00:02:43.841 --> 00:02:44.674
<v Speaker 1>orders of magnitude and the probability </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can understand yourself in </v>

33
00:02:50.411 --> 00:02:54.850
<v Speaker 1>anything approaching totality is </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily low.</v>

34
00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.130
<v Speaker 1>So this makes the study of personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>something very</v>

35
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.260
<v Speaker 1>daring and hopeless and complicated.</v>

36
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.353
<v Speaker 1>Now we're going to cycle through a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>large number of theorists and what </v>

37
00:03:13.931 --> 00:03:16.660
<v Speaker 1>you'll find is that although there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>commonalities between them,</v>

38
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.850
<v Speaker 1>there are market differences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then you might ask yourself,</v>

39
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.003
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the point of studying this </v>

40
00:03:28.491 --> 00:03:33.430
<v Speaker 1>sequence of theorists and ideas?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there's no point of agreement between</v>

41
00:03:33.431 --> 00:03:34.264
<v Speaker 1>them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say first there are points of </v>

42
00:03:37.841 --> 00:03:38.674
<v Speaker 1>agreement between them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although personality hasn't advanced to </v>

43
00:03:43.031 --> 00:03:43.864
<v Speaker 1>the point where I would say that we have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a margin theory that's free of internal </v>

44
00:03:48.461 --> 00:03:52.690
<v Speaker 1>contradictions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I would also say that</v>

45
00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.450
<v Speaker 1>personality is a hybrid discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's partly science,</v>

46
00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:03.813
<v Speaker 1>but it's partly engineering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The clinical element of it I would say </v>

47
00:04:08.591 --> 00:04:09.424
<v Speaker 1>is more like engineering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what engineers do is try to do </v>

48
00:04:11.531 --> 00:04:12.364
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They try to make something happen and </v>

49
00:04:14.741 --> 00:04:15.574
<v Speaker 1>they are informed by theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the point is still to build </v>

50
00:04:18.761 --> 00:04:19.594
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you're working as a clinical </v>

51
00:04:22.061 --> 00:04:22.894
<v Speaker 1>psychologist and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and most of the initial theorists that </v>

52
00:04:24.791 --> 00:04:25.624
<v Speaker 1>we'll discuss for the first little more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than a third to a half of the course or </v>

53
00:04:28.991 --> 00:04:29.824
<v Speaker 1>clinical theorists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to build something and </v>

54
00:04:34.601 --> 00:04:36.310
<v Speaker 1>they're dealing with very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very difficult</v>

55
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.640
<v Speaker 1>conceptual problems because</v>

56
00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.873
<v Speaker 1>they're either trying to cure mental </v>
<v Speaker 1>disorders or maybe even unhappiness and </v>

57
00:04:47.711 --> 00:04:51.760
<v Speaker 1>trying to bring about health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the problem with that is that</v>

58
00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.093
<v Speaker 1>it's not a straight forward thing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>define a mental disorder from a </v>

59
00:04:57.521 --> 00:04:58.354
<v Speaker 1>scientific perspective because what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy mentally and what's not is </v>

60
00:05:04.061 --> 00:05:09.061
<v Speaker 1>partly social judgment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's partly socially constructed and</v>

61
00:05:10.901 --> 00:05:11.734
<v Speaker 1>it partly has to do with norms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it partly has to do with ideals </v>

62
00:05:15.701 --> 00:05:20.170
<v Speaker 1>because you might also say that to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy is to be normal,</v>

63
00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.740
<v Speaker 1>but you could also say that to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy is to be ideal.</v>

64
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.233
<v Speaker 1>And then of course you run into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem of having to conceptualize an </v>

65
00:05:28.721 --> 00:05:33.721
<v Speaker 1>ideal and it isn't self evident that </v>
<v Speaker 1>science is capable of conceptualizing an</v>

66
00:05:36.941 --> 00:05:41.941
<v Speaker 1>ideal because ideals tend to fall into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the domain of moral judgments,</v>

67
00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.053
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or philosophical judgements rather than </v>

68
00:05:46.121 --> 00:05:48.610
<v Speaker 1>scientific judgements per se.</v>

69
00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:52.263
<v Speaker 1>So what I would say to you is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be worthwhile to approach this </v>

70
00:05:58.341 --> 00:06:02.390
<v Speaker 1>course as if you were an engineer of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>human spirit,</v>

71
00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.590
<v Speaker 1>an engineer of your own spirit to begin </v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

72
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:11.630
<v Speaker 1>but also an engineer of the spirits of </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people.</v>

73
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.840
<v Speaker 1>Because as you interact with other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

74
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.720
<v Speaker 1>you inevitably tell them what you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what you don't want.</v>

75
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:26.180
<v Speaker 1>When they give you what you want</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what you admire,</v>

76
00:06:26.181 --> 00:06:29.180
<v Speaker 1>you respond positively to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You pay attention to them,</v>

77
00:06:29.181 --> 00:06:31.520
<v Speaker 1>you smile at them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you focus,</v>

78
00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.000
<v Speaker 1>you focus your thoughts on them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you interact with them.</v>

79
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:39.710
<v Speaker 1>Then you reward them for acting in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular manner.</v>

80
00:06:39.711 --> 00:06:42.890
<v Speaker 1>And when they don't respond the way that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want,</v>

81
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:43.993
<v Speaker 1>then you punish them with a lock or by </v>
<v Speaker 1>turning away or by rejecting their </v>

82
00:06:49.041 --> 00:06:52.220
<v Speaker 1>friendship or when you were a child by </v>
<v Speaker 1>refusing to play for them,</v>

83
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.440
<v Speaker 1>play with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so</v>

84
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.870
<v Speaker 1>we're engaged in the co creation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>personalities,</v>

85
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:05.320
<v Speaker 1>our own and others and that also brings </v>
<v Speaker 1>up the same question,</v>

86
00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:12.140
<v Speaker 1>what is it that we are all collectively </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to be</v>

87
00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:14.780
<v Speaker 1>and trying to create?</v>

88
00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:17.400
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

89
00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:18.233
<v Speaker 1>I suspect that you all have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience of falling short of the </v>

90
00:07:21.991 --> 00:07:22.824
<v Speaker 1>ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an ideal that you hold for yourself or </v>

91
00:07:25.921 --> 00:07:30.921
<v Speaker 1>an ideal that other people hold for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suspect that you all feel the negative</v>

92
00:07:32.341 --> 00:07:34.560
<v Speaker 1>consequences of falling short of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideal.</v>

93
00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:37.483
<v Speaker 1>Freud would conceptualize that as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>superego imposing its judgment on the </v>

94
00:07:43.521 --> 00:07:45.230
<v Speaker 1>ego,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you being ego,</v>

95
00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:50.000
<v Speaker 1>the superego being</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hybrid,</v>

96
00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:50.853
<v Speaker 1>I suppose of</v>
<v Speaker 1>external external forces and also your </v>

97
00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:01.330
<v Speaker 1>internalization of those judgments and </v>
<v Speaker 1>forces.</v>

98
00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:08.210
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality per se I would say</v>

99
00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:12.473
<v Speaker 1>has these elements of ideal and how </v>
<v Speaker 1>structural elements in oil as well and </v>

100
00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:19.970
<v Speaker 1>we're going to talk about those more in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the second half of the class.</v>

101
00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:26.630
<v Speaker 1>The structural elements can be lined up </v>
<v Speaker 1>and outlined more scientifically.</v>

102
00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:30.380
<v Speaker 1>The second half of the cow class </v>
<v Speaker 1>concentrates more on</v>

103
00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:32.953
<v Speaker 1>physiology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain physiology and on statistical </v>

104
00:08:36.471 --> 00:08:38.570
<v Speaker 1>approaches to the description of </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>

105
00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:40.203
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose you might say that that </v>

106
00:08:41.691 --> 00:08:42.890
<v Speaker 1>outlines the territory.</v>

107
00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:48.870
<v Speaker 1>The course is called personality and its</v>
<v Speaker 1>transformations because</v>

108
00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:53.100
<v Speaker 1>we have personalities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's who you are now.</v>

109
00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:58.700
<v Speaker 1>But our are also capable of </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation of change.</v>

110
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:02.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously we think about that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>learning.</v>

111
00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:04.143
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of that might be regarded as </v>

112
00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:12.230
<v Speaker 1>factual learning and some of it might be</v>
<v Speaker 1>regarded as learning how to perceive and</v>

113
00:09:14.041 --> 00:09:14.874
<v Speaker 1>behave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say that the clinical </v>

114
00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:22.770
<v Speaker 1>psychologists that will cover to begin </v>
<v Speaker 1>with</v>

115
00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:25.253
<v Speaker 1>are much more concerned with the nature </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the implicit structures that shape </v>

116
00:09:30.481 --> 00:09:35.481
<v Speaker 1>your perceptions and also the implicit </v>
<v Speaker 1>structures that shape your behaviors and</v>

117
00:09:38.101 --> 00:09:43.101
<v Speaker 1>how they're integrated in relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>to your negative emotion,</v>

118
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:44.873
<v Speaker 1>health and wellbeing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the thinkers in the second half </v>

119
00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:50.483
<v Speaker 1>are more concerned about laying out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>structural elements of those features </v>

120
00:09:54.121 --> 00:09:59.010
<v Speaker 1>and relating them to underlying say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanistic phenomena,</v>

121
00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:02.730
<v Speaker 1>making the assumption which seems </v>
<v Speaker 1>warranted,</v>

122
00:10:02.731 --> 00:10:07.440
<v Speaker 1>that there's some relationship between </v>
<v Speaker 1>your personality and the manner in which</v>

123
00:10:07.441 --> 00:10:08.400
<v Speaker 1>your brain functions.</v>

124
00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:11.003
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to try</v>
<v Speaker 1>to provide you with a Meta narrative </v>

125
00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:18.600
<v Speaker 1>that will help you unite these different</v>
<v Speaker 1>theories.</v>

126
00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:20.393
<v Speaker 1>I've often found it useful when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to remember something to have a </v>

127
00:10:22.771 --> 00:10:23.604
<v Speaker 1>story to hang the fact on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise you're faced with the </v>

128
00:10:26.971 --> 00:10:29.550
<v Speaker 1>necessity of doing nothing but </v>
<v Speaker 1>memorization.</v>

129
00:10:29.551 --> 00:10:30.384
<v Speaker 1>And it isn't obvious to me that </v>
<v Speaker 1>memorization actually constitutes </v>

130
00:10:33.271 --> 00:10:34.920
<v Speaker 1>knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

131
00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:40.490
<v Speaker 1>what constitutes knowledge is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>generation of a cognitive structure that</v>

132
00:10:40.921 --> 00:10:45.921
<v Speaker 1>enables you to conduct yourself more </v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriately in life.</v>

133
00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:47.633
<v Speaker 1>And so I suppose you might say that of </v>
<v Speaker 1>course in psychology you could argue </v>

134
00:10:51.661 --> 00:10:52.494
<v Speaker 1>that of course in psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in personality is of course </v>

135
00:10:55.651 --> 00:10:56.484
<v Speaker 1>in applied wisdom as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Assuming that wisdom is in part your </v>

136
00:11:01.081 --> 00:11:04.110
<v Speaker 1>capacity to understand yourselves so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you don't,</v>

137
00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:09.720
<v Speaker 1>so that you don't present too much of an</v>
<v Speaker 1>intolerable mystery to yourself.</v>

138
00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:15.170
<v Speaker 1>And also to understand others so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can predict their behavior,</v>

139
00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:20.430
<v Speaker 1>understand their motivations and </v>
<v Speaker 1>negotiate with them,</v>

140
00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:22.163
<v Speaker 1>listen to them and formulate joint games</v>
<v Speaker 1>with them so that you can integrate </v>

141
00:11:27.871 --> 00:11:31.860
<v Speaker 1>yourself reasonably well with another </v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

142
00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:34.920
<v Speaker 1>with a family and in society.</v>

143
00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:40.143
<v Speaker 1>Well the structural elements of </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality might be regarded as the </v>

144
00:11:43.901 --> 00:11:44.734
<v Speaker 1>implicit structures that govern your </v>
<v Speaker 1>perception and that tilt you towards </v>

145
00:11:50.341 --> 00:11:51.174
<v Speaker 1>certain kinds of behaviors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can give you some examples can talk </v>

146
00:11:53.711 --> 00:11:54.544
<v Speaker 1>about the big five model just briefly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The big five personality model is a </v>

147
00:12:00.071 --> 00:12:02.350
<v Speaker 1>statistical model which we'll cover in </v>
<v Speaker 1>detail,</v>

148
00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:03.453
<v Speaker 1>trained by trait part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly during the second half of the </v>

149
00:12:06.911 --> 00:12:07.744
<v Speaker 1>course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way that the big five was generated </v>

150
00:12:10.721 --> 00:12:15.160
<v Speaker 1>was that it's dread being generated over</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 50 years.</v>

151
00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:16.863
<v Speaker 1>That personality psychologists gathered </v>
<v Speaker 1>together adjectives within the English </v>

152
00:12:21.131 --> 00:12:26.131
<v Speaker 1>language first that were used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>describe human beings as many adjectives</v>

153
00:12:27.071 --> 00:12:27.904
<v Speaker 1>is they could collect and then subjected</v>
<v Speaker 1>them to a process called factor </v>

154
00:12:31.871 --> 00:12:32.704
<v Speaker 1>analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what factor analysis does is enable </v>

155
00:12:34.301 --> 00:12:35.134
<v Speaker 1>you statistically to determine in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense how similar adjectives are to one </v>

156
00:12:39.731 --> 00:12:40.181
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

157
00:12:40.181 --> 00:12:41.014
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you gave a thousand people a list of </v>

158
00:12:47.471 --> 00:12:48.304
<v Speaker 1>adjectives to describe themselves with </v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the adjectives was happy and </v>

159
00:12:51.611 --> 00:12:52.444
<v Speaker 1>another of the adjectives was social,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd find that those who rated </v>

160
00:12:57.101 --> 00:13:01.300
<v Speaker 1>themselves high on happy would also rate</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves high on social.</v>

161
00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:02.403
<v Speaker 1>And those who rated themselves low on </v>
<v Speaker 1>happy would also rate themselves low on </v>

162
00:13:05.291 --> 00:13:06.124
<v Speaker 1>social.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by looking at those patterns of </v>

163
00:13:08.741 --> 00:13:09.574
<v Speaker 1>Covariation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can determine what the essential </v>

164
00:13:11.981 --> 00:13:12.814
<v Speaker 1>dimensions are of human personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the dimensions is roughly </v>

165
00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:20.290
<v Speaker 1>happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's extroversion.</v>

166
00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:25.840
<v Speaker 1>Another dimension is neuroticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a negative emotion dimension.</v>

167
00:13:25.841 --> 00:13:30.841
<v Speaker 1>So if you ask someone if they're anxious</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they score high,</v>

168
00:13:31.451 --> 00:13:32.284
<v Speaker 1>say on a scale of one to seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're also likely to score high on </v>

169
00:13:35.441 --> 00:13:36.274
<v Speaker 1>another item that says that they're sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it turns out that negative emotions </v>

170
00:13:40.871 --> 00:13:41.704
<v Speaker 1>clump together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that people who experience more </v>

171
00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:45.183
<v Speaker 1>of one negative emotion have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>propensity to experience more of all of </v>

172
00:13:48.431 --> 00:13:49.264
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's another dimension called </v>

173
00:13:51.221 --> 00:13:52.054
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And agreeable people are self </v>

174
00:13:55.301 --> 00:13:58.570
<v Speaker 1>sacrificing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>compassionate and polite.</v>

175
00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:01.240
<v Speaker 1>If you're dealing with an agreeable </v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

176
00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:05.050
<v Speaker 1>they don't like conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they care for other people.</v>

177
00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:06.453
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're dealing with an agreeable </v>

178
00:14:07.811 --> 00:14:08.644
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're likely to put your concerns </v>

179
00:14:10.991 --> 00:14:12.100
<v Speaker 1>ahead of theirs.</v>

180
00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:13.653
<v Speaker 1>They're non competitive and cooperative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a dimension where women are women </v>

181
00:14:18.771 --> 00:14:19.604
<v Speaker 1>score more highly than men on </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness across cultures including </v>

182
00:14:22.901 --> 00:14:23.734
<v Speaker 1>those cultures where the largest steps </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been taken towards producing an </v>

183
00:14:28.121 --> 00:14:30.850
<v Speaker 1>egalitarian social circumstance like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Scandinavia.</v>

184
00:14:30.851 --> 00:14:31.684
<v Speaker 1>Actually the gender differences in </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality there are larger than they </v>

185
00:14:34.361 --> 00:14:36.760
<v Speaker 1>are anywhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

186
00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:38.403
<v Speaker 1>another trait is conscientiousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conscientiousness is an excellent trait </v>

187
00:14:42.581 --> 00:14:45.940
<v Speaker 1>if you want to do well in school and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>

188
00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:48.040
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're a manager and </v>
<v Speaker 1>administrator.</v>

189
00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.160
<v Speaker 1>I can't say we understand a lot about </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness,</v>

190
00:14:52.161 --> 00:14:55.400
<v Speaker 1>although it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it reliably emerges from factor analytic</v>

191
00:14:55.401 --> 00:14:57.920
<v Speaker 1>studies of adjective groups across </v>
<v Speaker 1>different countries.</v>

192
00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:02.000
<v Speaker 1>Conscientious people are diligent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>industrious and orderly.</v>

193
00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:05.930
<v Speaker 1>Their orderliness tilts them towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>political conservatism by the way,</v>

194
00:15:05.931 --> 00:15:08.780
<v Speaker 1>because it turns out that your inbuilt </v>
<v Speaker 1>temperament,</v>

195
00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:09.643
<v Speaker 1>your inbuilt personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which constitutes a set of filters </v>

196
00:15:12.981 --> 00:15:13.814
<v Speaker 1>through which you view the world also </v>
<v Speaker 1>alters the manner in which you process </v>

197
00:15:18.021 --> 00:15:21.950
<v Speaker 1>information and influences the way that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you vote.</v>

198
00:15:21.951 --> 00:15:24.900
<v Speaker 1>And so you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I do believe that this is true,</v>

199
00:15:24.901 --> 00:15:27.500
<v Speaker 1>are we've been doing a lot of research </v>
<v Speaker 1>on this as of late.</v>

200
00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:33.960
<v Speaker 1>The more accurate a measure you take of </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's political beliefs,</v>

201
00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:37.530
<v Speaker 1>the more you find that personality is </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's predicting them.</v>

202
00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:41.430
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's a reasonable thing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about because you know,</v>

203
00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:45.750
<v Speaker 1>you have to have to figure out ways of </v>
<v Speaker 1>simplifying the world,</v>

204
00:15:45.751 --> 00:15:47.550
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you just can't do everything.</v>

205
00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:48.983
<v Speaker 1>And so people are specialized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have specialized niches that they </v>

206
00:15:51.601 --> 00:15:52.434
<v Speaker 1>occupy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can think about them as social </v>

207
00:15:53.521 --> 00:15:56.100
<v Speaker 1>niches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A niche is a place where your particular</v>

208
00:15:56.101 --> 00:16:00.690
<v Speaker 1>skills would serve to maintain you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're extroverted,</v>

209
00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:04.590
<v Speaker 1>you're going to look for a social niche </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you like to be around people.</v>

210
00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:05.663
<v Speaker 1>And if you're introverted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to spend much more time on </v>

211
00:16:07.111 --> 00:16:09.120
<v Speaker 1>your own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're an introverted person,</v>

212
00:16:09.121 --> 00:16:09.954
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to want a job where you're </v>

213
00:16:12.901 --> 00:16:13.734
<v Speaker 1>not selling and where you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>surrounded by groups of people who are </v>

214
00:16:16.051 --> 00:16:18.840
<v Speaker 1>making social demands on you all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time because it will wear you out.</v>

215
00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:22.230
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if you're extroverted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just exactly what you want.</v>

216
00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:23.663
<v Speaker 1>And so the extrovert sees the world as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>place of social opportunity and the </v>

217
00:16:27.541 --> 00:16:31.620
<v Speaker 1>introverts sees the world as a place to </v>
<v Speaker 1>retreat from and spend time alone.</v>

218
00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:36.960
<v Speaker 1>And it turns out that both of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>modes of being are valid.</v>

219
00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:39.000
<v Speaker 1>The issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least to some degree,</v>

220
00:16:39.001 --> 00:16:39.834
<v Speaker 1>is whether or not you're fortunate </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to match your temperament with </v>

221
00:16:43.651 --> 00:16:44.484
<v Speaker 1>the demands of the environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I suppose also whether you're </v>

222
00:16:46.441 --> 00:16:47.274
<v Speaker 1>fortunate enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fortunate enough so that you're born in </v>

223
00:16:49.861 --> 00:16:50.694
<v Speaker 1>an era where there actually is a niche </v>
<v Speaker 1>for your particular temperament because </v>

224
00:16:53.941 --> 00:16:56.880
<v Speaker 1>it isn't necessarily the case that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>will be the case.</v>

225
00:16:57.210 --> 00:16:58.043
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that all of these temperamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensions very because of evolutionary </v>

226
00:17:02.821 --> 00:17:03.930
<v Speaker 1>pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

227
00:17:03.931 --> 00:17:05.880
<v Speaker 1>So there's a distribution of </v>
<v Speaker 1>extroversion,</v>

228
00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:08.730
<v Speaker 1>a normal distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people are somewhere in the middle.</v>

229
00:17:08.731 --> 00:17:10.980
<v Speaker 1>And then as you go out towards the </v>
<v Speaker 1>extremes,</v>

230
00:17:10.981 --> 00:17:11.814
<v Speaker 1>there are fewer and fewer people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is that on average </v>

231
00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:16.463
<v Speaker 1>across large spans of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there have been environments that match </v>

232
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.120
<v Speaker 1>every single position on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution with most,</v>

233
00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:26.310
<v Speaker 1>most of the environments matching the </v>
<v Speaker 1>center.</v>

234
00:17:26.311 --> 00:17:27.144
<v Speaker 1>Because otherwise we wouldn't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolved that way and so sometimes being </v>

235
00:17:30.331 --> 00:17:34.110
<v Speaker 1>really extroverted is going to work well</v>
<v Speaker 1>for you in a minority of environments,</v>

236
00:17:34.111 --> 00:17:37.380
<v Speaker 1>a minority of niches and sometimes it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>just going to be a catastrophe.</v>

237
00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:42.000
<v Speaker 1>I suspect for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you live in a tyrannical society</v>

238
00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:44.610
<v Speaker 1>where any sign of</v>

239
00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:46.010
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

240
00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:46.963
<v Speaker 3>of</v>

241
00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.970
<v Speaker 1>personally oriented activity is likely </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get you in trouble,</v>

242
00:17:50.971 --> 00:17:55.440
<v Speaker 1>that being extroverted and low in </v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism wouldn't be a very good idea</v>

243
00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:56.333
<v Speaker 1>because you're going to be mouthy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>happy and saying a lot of things unable </v>

244
00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:02.820
<v Speaker 1>to keep your thoughts to yourself and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be relatively fearless.</v>

245
00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:03.713
<v Speaker 1>Now I don't know that for sure because </v>
<v Speaker 1>we haven't done the studies that </v>

246
00:18:06.271 --> 00:18:10.350
<v Speaker 1>precisely match temperamental proclivity</v>
<v Speaker 1>to environmental demand,</v>

247
00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:15.620
<v Speaker 1>but you get what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so conscientious people.</v>

248
00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:19.740
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientious people are industrious and</v>

249
00:18:19.741 --> 00:18:22.170
<v Speaker 1>orderly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We knew a little bit about orderliness.</v>

250
00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:26.610
<v Speaker 1>It seems to be associated strangely </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough with disgust sensitivity,</v>

251
00:18:26.611 --> 00:18:28.930
<v Speaker 1>which I suppose isn't that surprising.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

252
00:18:28.931 --> 00:18:32.490
<v Speaker 1>if you take an orderly person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you put them in a messy kitchen,</v>

253
00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:33.773
<v Speaker 1>they respond with disgust and want </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing more than to straighten it all </v>

254
00:18:37.651 --> 00:18:38.484
<v Speaker 1>out and organize it and clean it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's tremendous variability in </v>

255
00:18:40.981 --> 00:18:44.580
<v Speaker 1>orderliness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as I said,</v>

256
00:18:44.581 --> 00:18:46.590
<v Speaker 1>orderliness predicts political </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatism.</v>

257
00:18:46.591 --> 00:18:48.930
<v Speaker 1>It's not the only thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's certainly one of the things.</v>

258
00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:50.773
<v Speaker 3>MMM.</v>

259
00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:56.780
<v Speaker 1>The correlation between </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness and grades,</v>

260
00:18:56.781 --> 00:19:00.540
<v Speaker 1>it's about 0.4.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about 16% of the variance.</v>

261
00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:01.663
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the second best predictor of </v>

262
00:19:02.751 --> 00:19:06.590
<v Speaker 1>university grades after intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we'll talk about intelligence during</v>

263
00:19:06.591 --> 00:19:11.120
<v Speaker 1>this course to intelligence is actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>a relatively straight forward concept.</v>

264
00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:15.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I'll get into it today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but conscientious people,</v>

265
00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:16.243
<v Speaker 1>their industriousness and their </v>
<v Speaker 1>orderliness makes them schedule their </v>

266
00:19:18.501 --> 00:19:20.930
<v Speaker 1>time so they make efficient use of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

267
00:19:20.931 --> 00:19:22.640
<v Speaker 1>They use schedules and that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

268
00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:27.050
<v Speaker 1>We haven't been able to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything about the underlying biology or</v>

269
00:19:27.051 --> 00:19:27.884
<v Speaker 1>psychology of industriousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've tried really dozens and dozens of </v>

270
00:19:31.791 --> 00:19:32.624
<v Speaker 1>tests attempting to find a laboratory </v>
<v Speaker 1>measure on which industrious people do </v>

271
00:19:38.091 --> 00:19:39.920
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we failed completely.</v>

272
00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:42.380
<v Speaker 1>And there's no animal models of </v>
<v Speaker 1>industriousness either.</v>

273
00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:43.573
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say it's great mystery </v>
<v Speaker 1>that remains at the heart of trade </v>

274
00:19:46.281 --> 00:19:47.900
<v Speaker 1>psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

275
00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:50.510
<v Speaker 1>and maybe it's a human specific </v>
<v Speaker 1>category,</v>

276
00:19:50.511 --> 00:19:51.344
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can think of sled dogs maybe </v>

277
00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:53.863
<v Speaker 1>of being industrious and maybe it may be</v>
<v Speaker 1>sheep dogs and animals that work like </v>

278
00:19:56.991 --> 00:19:57.824
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of course they've been trained by </v>

279
00:19:58.431 --> 00:19:59.120
<v Speaker 1>human beings.</v>

280
00:19:59.120 --> 00:19:59.953
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't obvious that animals are </v>

281
00:20:02.811 --> 00:20:03.644
<v Speaker 1>industrious the same way we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean industriousness involves </v>

282
00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:10.910
<v Speaker 1>sacrificing the present for the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

283
00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:15.740
<v Speaker 1>And it seems like you have to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize time in order to sacrifice</v>

284
00:20:15.741 --> 00:20:19.520
<v Speaker 1>the present for the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I would recommend</v>

285
00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:21.343
<v Speaker 1>that you do as students in this course </v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe in every course speaking of </v>

286
00:20:25.731 --> 00:20:26.564
<v Speaker 1>industriousness is come up with a plan </v>
<v Speaker 1>of attack for the course and use a </v>

287
00:20:30.321 --> 00:20:31.430
<v Speaker 1>scheduler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

288
00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:35.510
<v Speaker 1>if you treat your university career like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fulltime job,</v>

289
00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:36.853
<v Speaker 1>you're much more likely to succeed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you keep up on the readings and </v>

290
00:20:40.221 --> 00:20:43.730
<v Speaker 1>you keep up on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the essays and all of that,</v>

291
00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:44.953
<v Speaker 1>then you're much less likely as well to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fall into despair when you get too far </v>

292
00:20:49.211 --> 00:20:50.044
<v Speaker 1>behind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Using a google calendar or something </v>

293
00:20:52.001 --> 00:20:52.834
<v Speaker 1>like that to organize a schedule for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>entire semester at the beginning of the </v>

294
00:20:56.861 --> 00:20:57.694
<v Speaker 1>semester can be invaluable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're not very </v>

295
00:21:00.161 --> 00:21:03.520
<v Speaker 1>industriousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very industrious because it can keep you</v>

296
00:21:03.521 --> 00:21:04.150
<v Speaker 1>on track.</v>

297
00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:07.630
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things we know about </v>
<v Speaker 1>industrious people is that they are very</v>

298
00:21:07.631 --> 00:21:11.440
<v Speaker 1>good at using schedules and planning the</v>
<v Speaker 1>use of their time.</v>

299
00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:15.100
<v Speaker 1>And so I would like to say that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should all be smarter,</v>

300
00:21:15.101 --> 00:21:16.960
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know how you could be </v>
<v Speaker 1>smarter.</v>

301
00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:20.110
<v Speaker 1>We don't know anything about how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>improve intelligence.</v>

302
00:21:20.111 --> 00:21:20.944
<v Speaker 1>And I suppose we don't really know </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything about how to improve </v>

303
00:21:23.141 --> 00:21:23.974
<v Speaker 1>industriousness either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I can tell you that people who are </v>

304
00:21:26.381 --> 00:21:27.214
<v Speaker 1>industrious come up with a strategy for </v>
<v Speaker 1>solving the problem that's ahead of </v>

305
00:21:31.391 --> 00:21:32.224
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they do whatever they can to </v>

306
00:21:33.341 --> 00:21:35.530
<v Speaker 1>stick to the strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so for example,</v>

307
00:21:35.531 --> 00:21:39.940
<v Speaker 1>if you sat down today or tomorrow for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of hours,</v>

308
00:21:39.941 --> 00:21:43.120
<v Speaker 1>three hours and you filled in a google </v>
<v Speaker 1>calendar,</v>

309
00:21:43.121 --> 00:21:48.121
<v Speaker 1>whatever you happen to use with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>strategy for studying and a list of when</v>

310
00:21:48.371 --> 00:21:50.380
<v Speaker 1>all your assignments are due and all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

311
00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:52.930
<v Speaker 1>and when you're going to sit down and </v>
<v Speaker 1>study,</v>

312
00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:54.633
<v Speaker 1>then you won't be in a position where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to cram for 10 hours a day </v>

313
00:21:57.310 --> 00:22:01.090
<v Speaker 1>hopelessly right before you know an </v>
<v Speaker 1>important exam.</v>

314
00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:03.520
<v Speaker 1>It's also a very ineffective way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>studying.</v>

315
00:22:03.521 --> 00:22:04.750
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm being,</v>

316
00:22:04.751 --> 00:22:07.240
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who cram for 10 hours say they're</v>

317
00:22:07.241 --> 00:22:09.550
<v Speaker 1>studying for 10 hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they rarely are because,</v>

318
00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:13.990
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't study for 10 hours.</v>

319
00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:17.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't have the power of concentration </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would enable me to do that for that</v>

320
00:22:17.651 --> 00:22:18.484
<v Speaker 1>prolonged period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can manage about three hours of </v>

321
00:22:20.771 --> 00:22:21.604
<v Speaker 1>intense intellectual activity before I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty done and it's also the case that </v>

322
00:22:26.141 --> 00:22:26.974
<v Speaker 1>if you study and then sleep and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>study and then sleep and then study and </v>

323
00:22:29.591 --> 00:22:31.060
<v Speaker 1>then sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you space it out,</v>

324
00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:33.340
<v Speaker 1>then you're much more likely to </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember.</v>

325
00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:34.863
<v Speaker 1>It's also much more likely that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>much more likely to remember if you try </v>

326
00:22:37.751 --> 00:22:38.584
<v Speaker 1>to recall the material.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so highlighting in that sort of </v>

327
00:22:40.781 --> 00:22:43.150
<v Speaker 1>thing isn't very useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But reading,</v>

328
00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:44.163
<v Speaker 1>closing the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>summarizing what you've read without </v>

329
00:22:46.631 --> 00:22:49.300
<v Speaker 1>opening the damn book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's useful.</v>

330
00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:50.673
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>practicing remembering and that's what </v>

331
00:22:53.951 --> 00:22:56.950
<v Speaker 1>you have to practice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're practicing memorization,</v>

332
00:22:56.951 --> 00:22:57.784
<v Speaker 1>you have to practice remembering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't just go over the thing over </v>

333
00:23:00.731 --> 00:23:01.564
<v Speaker 1>and over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'll help you with recognition </v>

334
00:23:02.831 --> 00:23:04.450
<v Speaker 1>memory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some,</v>

335
00:23:04.451 --> 00:23:06.040
<v Speaker 1>but it won't help you with recall </v>
<v Speaker 1>memory.</v>

336
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.950
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last trade is openness.</v>

337
00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:10.383
<v Speaker 1>Openness is a creativity trait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also associated with intelligence </v>

338
00:23:13.721 --> 00:23:16.750
<v Speaker 1>in that intelligent people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm speaking technically of Iq,</v>

339
00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:20.590
<v Speaker 1>tend to be higher in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tend to be more creative,</v>

340
00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:21.513
<v Speaker 1>which is hardly surprising.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Creative people are more likely to be </v>

341
00:23:25.151 --> 00:23:27.470
<v Speaker 1>liberal politically by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

342
00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:30.460
<v Speaker 1>they like novelty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They like aesthetics,</v>

343
00:23:30.461 --> 00:23:32.890
<v Speaker 1>they like fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they like movies.</v>

344
00:23:32.891 --> 00:23:33.724
<v Speaker 1>They like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are they like poetry there something </v>

345
00:23:35.411 --> 00:23:40.270
<v Speaker 1>about them that grants them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anaesthetic sensitivity and,</v>

346
00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:41.590
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

347
00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:44.040
<v Speaker 1>that's an inbuilt trait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

348
00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:46.730
<v Speaker 1>it's not the case by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that everyone's creative.</v>

349
00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:47.870
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>far from it.</v>

350
00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:48.743
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've used the creative achievement </v>

351
00:23:49.821 --> 00:23:53.360
<v Speaker 1>questionnaire to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to measure people's creativity.</v>

352
00:23:53.361 --> 00:23:55.220
<v Speaker 1>I'll talk to you about that later in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>class.</v>

353
00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:56.503
<v Speaker 1>And the creative achievement </v>
<v Speaker 1>questionnaire takes 13 dimensions of </v>

354
00:23:59.631 --> 00:24:00.770
<v Speaker 1>creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

355
00:24:00.771 --> 00:24:01.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>writing,</v>

356
00:24:01.761 --> 00:24:03.500
<v Speaker 1>dancing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>acting,</v>

357
00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:06.650
<v Speaker 1>scientific investigation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurial activity,</v>

358
00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:08.970
<v Speaker 1>architectural activity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

359
00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:10.540
<v Speaker 1>cooking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

360
00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:13.370
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a handful of others singing,</v>

361
00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:14.420
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

362
00:24:14.421 --> 00:24:15.254
<v Speaker 1>the sorts of things that you would </v>
<v Speaker 1>assume that people could be creative </v>

363
00:24:17.511 --> 00:24:18.344
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it asks people to rate </v>

364
00:24:20.271 --> 00:24:21.104
<v Speaker 1>themselves on a scale from one to 10 on </v>
<v Speaker 1>their level of achievement with regards </v>

365
00:24:26.031 --> 00:24:28.280
<v Speaker 1>to all those creative domains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With zero being,</v>

366
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:31.850
<v Speaker 1>I have no training or proficiency in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this area,</v>

367
00:24:31.851 --> 00:24:32.684
<v Speaker 1>and 70% of people score zero across the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire creative achievement </v>

368
00:24:36.381 --> 00:24:40.160
<v Speaker 1>questionnaire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A tiny proportion of people are outliers</v>

369
00:24:40.161 --> 00:24:40.994
<v Speaker 1>way out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're creative in many dimensions </v>

370
00:24:42.681 --> 00:24:45.180
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously and exceptionally </v>
<v Speaker 1>creative.</v>

371
00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:47.990
<v Speaker 1>It turns out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you'll find out that that pattern,</v>

372
00:24:47.991 --> 00:24:52.010
<v Speaker 1>which is called a pareto distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where most people stack up at zero and a</v>

373
00:24:52.011 --> 00:24:55.010
<v Speaker 1>few people are way out on the creative </v>
<v Speaker 1>end,</v>

374
00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:57.800
<v Speaker 1>characterizes all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>distributions,</v>

375
00:24:57.801 --> 00:25:00.110
<v Speaker 1>like the distribution of money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

376
00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:05.290
<v Speaker 1>which is why 1% of the people have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming majority of the money.</v>

377
00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:07.393
<v Speaker 1>It's a different 1% across time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It he'd like it churns and you're much </v>

378
00:25:11.721 --> 00:25:14.210
<v Speaker 1>more likely to be in the 1% if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>older,</v>

379
00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:15.763
<v Speaker 1>logically enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things you do as you </v>

380
00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:22.040
<v Speaker 1>age is you trade youth for money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're fortunate,</v>

381
00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:24.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't think the trade is really worth </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

382
00:25:24.441 --> 00:25:27.740
<v Speaker 1>but that's the best you've got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

383
00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:29.233
<v Speaker 1>those particular traits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can think of those as ways that you </v>

384
00:25:31.941 --> 00:25:33.650
<v Speaker 1>simplify the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

385
00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:34.813
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of different places that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can act in the world and there's </v>

386
00:25:37.671 --> 00:25:40.640
<v Speaker 1>lots of different ways you can look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and survive.</v>

387
00:25:40.641 --> 00:25:44.120
<v Speaker 1>That's why you can be a plumber and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lawyer and an engineer,</v>

388
00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:46.190
<v Speaker 1>and those all work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

389
00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:47.203
<v Speaker 1>Even though they're very different modes</v>
<v Speaker 1>of being and you can have different </v>

390
00:25:49.731 --> 00:25:50.564
<v Speaker 1>personalities and survive as long as </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're capable of finding the place </v>

391
00:25:55.761 --> 00:26:00.761
<v Speaker 1>where your particular filters and </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavioral proclivities match the demand</v>

392
00:26:01.131 --> 00:26:01.910
<v Speaker 1>of the environment.</v>

393
00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:06.770
<v Speaker 1>And a huge part I would say of </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful adaptation is precisely that.</v>

394
00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:09.800
<v Speaker 1>Now there are other elements of </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality too.</v>

395
00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:12.410
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I've been struck </v>
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>

396
00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:13.303
<v Speaker 1>and this is actually one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>criticisms I have of the psychoanalysts </v>

397
00:26:16.371 --> 00:26:17.204
<v Speaker 1>and the clinicians in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though I have great admiration for </v>

398
00:26:19.671 --> 00:26:20.504
<v Speaker 1>them and would say that what they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to say is very much worth listening to </v>

399
00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:28.430
<v Speaker 1>is that it's not obvious that your </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality is inside you.</v>

400
00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:30.543
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think you know a human being is a </v>

401
00:26:32.871 --> 00:26:36.320
<v Speaker 1>strange multilevel thing and you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>ask yourself,</v>

402
00:26:36.321 --> 00:26:38.270
<v Speaker 1>well for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

403
00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:43.510
<v Speaker 1>is your mother more a part of you then </v>
<v Speaker 1>your arm or maybe even more precisely is</v>

404
00:26:44.191 --> 00:26:47.310
<v Speaker 1>your child more a part of you then your </v>
<v Speaker 1>arm?</v>

405
00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:48.683
<v Speaker 1>It certainly people will do drastically </v>
<v Speaker 1>self sacrificing things to maintain the </v>

406
00:26:53.131 --> 00:26:55.770
<v Speaker 1>lives of their children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you're,</v>

407
00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:59.440
<v Speaker 1>you're a person and you're made out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>all sub sort of sub components of,</v>

408
00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:00.413
<v Speaker 1>of a person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of which you can see when you look </v>

409
00:27:02.041 --> 00:27:05.040
<v Speaker 1>at a person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the complicated machinery inside you</v>

410
00:27:05.041 --> 00:27:06.180
<v Speaker 1>that makes you who you are.</v>

411
00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:07.013
<v Speaker 1>And then outside of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course here nested in all sorts of </v>

412
00:27:10.351 --> 00:27:13.080
<v Speaker 1>complex systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're part of a family and,</v>

413
00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:15.840
<v Speaker 1>and you're part of a community and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's part of a province.</v>

414
00:27:15.841 --> 00:27:16.674
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of the state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of an international </v>

415
00:27:19.261 --> 00:27:21.750
<v Speaker 1>consortium of states.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of an ecosystem.</v>

416
00:27:21.751 --> 00:27:26.751
<v Speaker 1>And how you make a distinction between </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and the systems that you're embedded</v>

417
00:27:29.311 --> 00:27:32.850
<v Speaker 1>in is also an extraordinary difficulty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when it,</v>

418
00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:35.640
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things that you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do as a clinical psychologist,</v>

419
00:27:35.641 --> 00:27:36.474
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're trying to diagnose someone </v>

420
00:27:37.561 --> 00:27:39.570
<v Speaker 1>with depression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you think,</v>

421
00:27:39.571 --> 00:27:41.850
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this person's dreadfully unhappy.</v>

422
00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:46.620
<v Speaker 1>Or you can think about that as a problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>with their psychological adjustment.</v>

423
00:27:46.621 --> 00:27:47.490
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way that they're,</v>

424
00:27:47.491 --> 00:27:48.930
<v Speaker 1>they're learning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at the world.</v>

425
00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:53.370
<v Speaker 1>But if you look at the epidemiological </v>
<v Speaker 1>literature,</v>

426
00:27:53.371 --> 00:27:54.204
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that you find is that </v>

427
00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:57.713
<v Speaker 1>very many people have a first depressive</v>
<v Speaker 1>episode after something genuinely </v>

428
00:28:02.311 --> 00:28:04.260
<v Speaker 1>terrible has happened to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

429
00:28:04.261 --> 00:28:05.094
<v Speaker 1>They've lost someone or they've become </v>
<v Speaker 1>injured or or they've become unemployed </v>

430
00:28:08.461 --> 00:28:09.294
<v Speaker 1>because unemployment is a terrible shock</v>
<v Speaker 1>to people and it's not precisely self </v>

431
00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:17.700
<v Speaker 1>evident that you can consider someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's unhappy and desperate because they</v>

432
00:28:17.701 --> 00:28:20.280
<v Speaker 1>no longer have a job depressed.</v>

433
00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:24.890
<v Speaker 1>They're certainly sad and they're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing very well,</v>

434
00:28:24.891 --> 00:28:25.724
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that they no longer have an</v>
<v Speaker 1>income is actually something with </v>

435
00:28:30.050 --> 00:28:30.883
<v Speaker 1>dramatic practical consequences and </v>
<v Speaker 1>treating that as if it's a mental </v>

436
00:28:34.941 --> 00:28:39.941
<v Speaker 1>disorder seems to be counter productive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also the case for example,</v>

437
00:28:40.551 --> 00:28:44.420
<v Speaker 1>that if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone comes into to talk to you and</v>

438
00:28:44.421 --> 00:28:45.254
<v Speaker 1>they're very upset and they may manifest</v>
<v Speaker 1>the signs of say an anxiety disorder or </v>

439
00:28:49.101 --> 00:28:49.934
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depression or or other other clinical </v>

440
00:28:52.191 --> 00:28:53.024
<v Speaker 1>features for that matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to do a careful analysis of </v>

441
00:28:56.421 --> 00:28:59.120
<v Speaker 1>their manner in which they're embedded </v>
<v Speaker 1>in their family.</v>

442
00:28:59.121 --> 00:28:59.954
<v Speaker 1>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is something that we'll talk </v>

443
00:29:01.431 --> 00:29:02.264
<v Speaker 1>about quite</v>

444
00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:06.510
<v Speaker 1>thoroughly when we come to discussing </v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud,</v>

445
00:29:06.511 --> 00:29:07.500
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

446
00:29:07.501 --> 00:29:08.334
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like everybody's families are </v>

447
00:29:09.401 --> 00:29:11.970
<v Speaker 1>necessarily particularly happy places to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>

448
00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:13.013
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

449
00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:14.003
<v Speaker 1>human beings are very dependent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a very long period of </v>

450
00:29:16.381 --> 00:29:19.980
<v Speaker 1>dependency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because we're so cortically hyper</v>

451
00:29:19.981 --> 00:29:20.814
<v Speaker 1>developed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes a very long time to program us </v>

452
00:29:22.681 --> 00:29:23.514
<v Speaker 1>into something that's vaguely capable of</v>
<v Speaker 1>maneuvering on its own and that </v>

453
00:29:27.631 --> 00:29:28.464
<v Speaker 1>produces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course the very tight familial bonds </v>

454
00:29:30.271 --> 00:29:31.104
<v Speaker 1>that we all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we all desperately require because </v>

455
00:29:34.291 --> 00:29:36.870
<v Speaker 1>who wants to be alone in the world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it also,</v>

456
00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:38.543
<v Speaker 1>it also exposes us to the probability of</v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming entangled into even </v>

457
00:29:43.481 --> 00:29:44.314
<v Speaker 1>multigenerational family pathology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it isn't obvious always and </v>

458
00:29:48.911 --> 00:29:49.744
<v Speaker 1>certainly hasn't been to me when I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>seen my clients that the fundamental </v>

459
00:29:53.021 --> 00:29:58.021
<v Speaker 1>problem with the client is the client.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes the fundamental problem is</v>

460
00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:01.293
<v Speaker 1>is the family</v>
<v Speaker 1>and and perhaps that person has been </v>

461
00:30:05.411 --> 00:30:06.244
<v Speaker 1>identified as the problem person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's rather convenient for everyone who </v>

462
00:30:09.541 --> 00:30:12.190
<v Speaker 1>was involved to make that </v>
<v Speaker 1>presupposition.</v>

463
00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:16.480
<v Speaker 1>It's also the case that this is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Friday and idea.</v>

464
00:30:16.481 --> 00:30:18.340
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the depaul idea,</v>

465
00:30:18.341 --> 00:30:19.174
<v Speaker 1>that it's very easy for people to become</v>
<v Speaker 1>over dependent on their parents and for </v>

466
00:30:23.891 --> 00:30:24.724
<v Speaker 1>the parents to facilitate that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then for the primary developmental </v>

467
00:30:28.601 --> 00:30:32.470
<v Speaker 1>problem for the individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

468
00:30:32.471 --> 00:30:33.304
<v Speaker 1>to become free of the interfering </v>
<v Speaker 1>elements of the family so that they can </v>

469
00:30:40.030 --> 00:30:43.060
<v Speaker 1>exist as independent individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

470
00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:44.613
<v Speaker 1>and then of course there are cultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>variations in that that make that </v>

471
00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:47.913
<v Speaker 1>proposition complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's a fundamental tenant say a </v>

472
00:30:51.641 --> 00:30:56.641
<v Speaker 1>Friday in psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the clinical psychologists,</v>

473
00:30:57.010 --> 00:30:59.320
<v Speaker 1>all of whom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet we're going to study,</v>

474
00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:00.573
<v Speaker 1>have a pronounced Western orientation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the fundamental presuppositions </v>

475
00:31:04.721 --> 00:31:05.554
<v Speaker 1>is that part of the hallmark of positive</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological development is the </v>

476
00:31:10.691 --> 00:31:14.530
<v Speaker 1>creation of an individual that's capable</v>
<v Speaker 1>of acting independently.</v>

477
00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:16.480
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

478
00:31:16.481 --> 00:31:17.314
<v Speaker 1>an implicit ideal that lurks at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom of the clinical presuppositions </v>

479
00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:25.690
<v Speaker 1>of all the theorists that are classic </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologists.</v>

480
00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:31.800
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>now it's a very old picture.</v>

481
00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:38.490
<v Speaker 1>It's Jonah emerging from the whale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a variant of a,</v>

482
00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:42.660
<v Speaker 1>a myth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Myth is the dragon myth.</v>

483
00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:43.553
<v Speaker 1>I suppose the Dragon Myth is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a dragon that lives under the </v>

484
00:31:48.031 --> 00:31:48.864
<v Speaker 1>ground that's eternal and now and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>it rises out of the ground to threaten </v>

485
00:31:54.211 --> 00:31:55.044
<v Speaker 1>the state and someone within the state </v>
<v Speaker 1>determines to go confront the dragon </v>

486
00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:02.693
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily and does so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then brings back something of great </v>

487
00:32:06.481 --> 00:32:07.314
<v Speaker 1>value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes if the the hero is generally </v>

488
00:32:12.181 --> 00:32:13.014
<v Speaker 1>male,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes the thing of great value is a </v>

489
00:32:14.941 --> 00:32:19.020
<v Speaker 1>female that the dragon has kidnapped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a St George Story.</v>

490
00:32:19.021 --> 00:32:22.110
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes it's gold and other </v>
<v Speaker 1>treasure,</v>

491
00:32:22.111 --> 00:32:23.650
<v Speaker 1>like in the story of the hobbit.</v>

492
00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:25.540
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

493
00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:28.840
<v Speaker 1>story that you all know very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a classic hero story.</v>

494
00:32:28.841 --> 00:32:29.674
<v Speaker 1>And the hero's story is another </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental element of the clinical </v>

495
00:32:34.451 --> 00:32:35.284
<v Speaker 1>theories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's predicated on the idea </v>

496
00:32:37.631 --> 00:32:42.631
<v Speaker 1>that you learn through voluntary contact</v>
<v Speaker 1>with that,</v>

497
00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:44.893
<v Speaker 1>that frightens or disgusts you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now it's a hallmark of </v>

498
00:32:48.771 --> 00:32:51.770
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalytic theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Young Carl Young,</v>

499
00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:52.633
<v Speaker 1>who will discuss in detail said his </v>
<v Speaker 1>primary dictum was in steer Colinas </v>

500
00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:00.500
<v Speaker 1>invented tour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I'm sure I massacring because it's</v>

501
00:33:00.501 --> 00:33:01.334
<v Speaker 1>Latin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it meant in filth that will be </v>

502
00:33:03.591 --> 00:33:06.410
<v Speaker 1>found.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the hallmarks of the clinical</v>

503
00:33:06.411 --> 00:33:11.180
<v Speaker 1>theories is that within the confines of </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's experience,</v>

504
00:33:11.390 --> 00:33:12.223
<v Speaker 1>and you can think about this as </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience out in the world or </v>

505
00:33:14.721 --> 00:33:18.620
<v Speaker 1>experience in the unconscious mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are</v>

506
00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:25.240
<v Speaker 1>dirty little secrets let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and skeletons and</v>

507
00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:27.813
<v Speaker 1>dreadful old fears and remnants of abuse</v>
<v Speaker 1>and memories of pathological behavior </v>

508
00:33:34.671 --> 00:33:35.504
<v Speaker 1>and failures of courage that you leave </v>
<v Speaker 1>you undeveloped perhaps out of </v>

509
00:33:41.421 --> 00:33:42.254
<v Speaker 1>avoidance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that the psychoanalytic process is </v>

510
00:33:45.561 --> 00:33:46.394
<v Speaker 1>precisely the careful encounter with </v>
<v Speaker 1>those forgotten and and repressed </v>

511
00:33:53.241 --> 00:33:58.241
<v Speaker 1>elements of the self in the hope that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>clear encounter will redeem them,</v>

512
00:34:00.290 --> 00:34:01.123
<v Speaker 1>unite them with the remainder of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality and make you make you </v>

513
00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:07.130
<v Speaker 1>stronger in consequence.</v>

514
00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:08.623
<v Speaker 1>And I would say that that's just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>variant of the manner in which human </v>

515
00:34:11.451 --> 00:34:12.284
<v Speaker 1>beings learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we'll talk about this more in </v>

516
00:34:13.941 --> 00:34:18.560
<v Speaker 1>relationship to piaget because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>always learn when you're wrong,</v>

517
00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:20.713
<v Speaker 1>which is very annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what do you learn when you're </v>

518
00:34:23.121 --> 00:34:25.400
<v Speaker 1>correct you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're walking in the world,</v>

519
00:34:25.401 --> 00:34:26.234
<v Speaker 1>you're operating in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a sense of what you want to </v>

520
00:34:29.271 --> 00:34:30.104
<v Speaker 1>have happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're always looking at the world </v>

521
00:34:32.301 --> 00:34:34.370
<v Speaker 1>through this sense of what you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have happen.</v>

522
00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:38.780
<v Speaker 1>You're acting so that what you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have happen will happen.</v>

523
00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:42.650
<v Speaker 1>And when it happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then you're happy because,</v>

524
00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:45.770
<v Speaker 1>well first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get what you want and that's good.</v>

525
00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:46.693
<v Speaker 1>Maybe depending on what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's also good because if you get </v>

526
00:34:50.361 --> 00:34:53.990
<v Speaker 1>what you want when you act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it turns out that your model of how</v>

527
00:34:53.991 --> 00:34:55.700
<v Speaker 1>to act is valid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

528
00:34:56.090 --> 00:34:56.923
<v Speaker 1>The outcome that you get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you want indicates no error on the </v>

529
00:35:00.501 --> 00:35:01.334
<v Speaker 1>part of your model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's very frequently the case that </v>

530
00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:08.720
<v Speaker 1>when you act to get what you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't get what you want.</v>

531
00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:13.400
<v Speaker 1>And then that's unpleasant because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get what you want.</v>

532
00:35:13.850 --> 00:35:14.683
<v Speaker 1>But it's even more unpleasant because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>brings with it the hint of a suggestion </v>

533
00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:18.973
<v Speaker 1>that the manner in which you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>construing the world is incorrect at </v>

534
00:35:22.731 --> 00:35:26.600
<v Speaker 1>some indeterminant level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

535
00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:31.490
<v Speaker 1>if you tell a party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell a joke at a party,</v>

536
00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:35.930
<v Speaker 1>you presume that people will attend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when they hear the joke,</v>

537
00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:37.033
<v Speaker 1>they will laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if you tell the joke and it </v>

538
00:35:39.481 --> 00:35:43.890
<v Speaker 1>goes flat or even worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disgusts and offends people,</v>

539
00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:48.690
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to be taken aback.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly because you didn't get</v>

540
00:35:48.691 --> 00:35:50.910
<v Speaker 1>what you want and that's not so good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

541
00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:55.740
<v Speaker 1>but it's more because there's something </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong with the way you conceptualize the</v>

542
00:35:55.741 --> 00:36:00.600
<v Speaker 1>situation and then you're faced with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem and the problem is the emergence</v>

543
00:36:00.601 --> 00:36:03.090
<v Speaker 1>of a domain of the unknown.</v>

544
00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:05.370
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what kind of mistake did you make?</v>

545
00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:07.590
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're not as funny as you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>you are.</v>

546
00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:10.020
<v Speaker 1>Not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That could be a big problem.</v>

547
00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:15.030
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're not around people that who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are the way you think they are.</v>

548
00:36:15.031 --> 00:36:17.940
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they don't like you as much as you</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought they liked you.</v>

549
00:36:17.941 --> 00:36:18.774
<v Speaker 1>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the potential for various paranoid </v>

550
00:36:22.441 --> 00:36:23.274
<v Speaker 1>thoughts of increasing severity to come </v>
<v Speaker 1>welling up at you in a situation where </v>

551
00:36:27.781 --> 00:36:28.614
<v Speaker 1>you make a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even a trivial social mistake is quite </v>

552
00:36:30.871 --> 00:36:34.260
<v Speaker 1>broad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you make an error of that sort,</v>

553
00:36:35.010 --> 00:36:35.843
<v Speaker 1>you have to face it and sort through all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the possibilities so that you can find </v>

554
00:36:39.451 --> 00:36:40.284
<v Speaker 1>out what it was that you did wrong and </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to retool it so that in the future </v>

555
00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:47.700
<v Speaker 1>you don't make the same mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that requires,</v>

556
00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:51.810
<v Speaker 1>well that requires in some sense what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you might describe as a journey into the</v>

557
00:36:51.811 --> 00:36:52.740
<v Speaker 1>belly of the beast.</v>

558
00:36:52.770 --> 00:36:53.603
<v Speaker 1>The beast being that place where things </v>
<v Speaker 1>have fallen apart and where you're </v>

559
00:36:56.671 --> 00:37:00.450
<v Speaker 1>overwhelmed with negative emotion and </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos and confusion.</v>

560
00:37:00.451 --> 00:37:01.284
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very old story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the story of the journey to the </v>

561
00:37:04.051 --> 00:37:06.780
<v Speaker 1>underworld.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the hero is the person who makes the</v>

562
00:37:06.781 --> 00:37:07.614
<v Speaker 1>voluntary journey to the underworld to </v>
<v Speaker 1>collect what's been languishing down </v>

563
00:37:11.431 --> 00:37:12.264
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the basic motif of </v>

564
00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:18.240
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalytic theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's the basic motif in some</v>

565
00:37:18.241 --> 00:37:23.241
<v Speaker 1>sense of clinical practice because one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the things that you do as a clinician</v>

566
00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:29.070
<v Speaker 1>is find out what people are afraid of </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what they're avoiding.</v>

567
00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:32.790
<v Speaker 1>And that can be in their past or in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their present or in their future.</v>

568
00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:34.493
<v Speaker 1>Break it down into smaller pieces and </v>
<v Speaker 1>help them devise strategies of approach </v>

569
00:37:39.391 --> 00:37:40.224
<v Speaker 1>and mastery and that improves the </v>
<v Speaker 1>quality of their personality and helps </v>

570
00:37:47.191 --> 00:37:51.180
<v Speaker 1>develop them into people who won't make </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same mistakes over and over again.</v>

571
00:37:52.990 --> 00:37:55.650
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so well,</v>

572
00:37:56.280 --> 00:38:00.150
<v Speaker 1>why these this plethora of tools?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

573
00:38:00.151 --> 00:38:05.151
<v Speaker 1>I said in some sense being a personality</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologist is like being an engineer.</v>

574
00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:08.393
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to build better people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might say that if you're a </v>

575
00:38:11.461 --> 00:38:12.294
<v Speaker 1>carpenter or a mechanic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that your ability to fix a vehicle or </v>

576
00:38:18.901 --> 00:38:23.520
<v Speaker 1>build a house is dependent on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>proficiency with regards to the use of a</v>

577
00:38:23.521 --> 00:38:26.640
<v Speaker 1>multitude of tools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then you might say,</v>

578
00:38:26.641 --> 00:38:27.474
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more tools you have at your </v>

579
00:38:28.051 --> 00:38:28.884
<v Speaker 1>disposal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more likely it is that you're going </v>

580
00:38:31.861 --> 00:38:36.861
<v Speaker 1>to manage things properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what I would like to offer you is</v>

581
00:38:36.911 --> 00:38:40.480
<v Speaker 1>the possibility that what you're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to encounter in this course</v>

582
00:38:42.010 --> 00:38:42.843
<v Speaker 1>is a series of sophisticated conceptual </v>
<v Speaker 1>tools that will help you understand </v>

583
00:38:47.951 --> 00:38:52.150
<v Speaker 1>yourself better and therefore better </v>
<v Speaker 1>orient yourself in the world.</v>

584
00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:53.193
<v Speaker 1>I regard this course as intensely </v>
<v Speaker 1>practical and that's because I believe </v>

585
00:38:57.701 --> 00:39:02.701
<v Speaker 1>that you have nothing to rely on in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life that's more crucial to your success</v>

586
00:39:06.490 --> 00:39:07.323
<v Speaker 1>as you move through life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then your character and your </v>

587
00:39:09.071 --> 00:39:12.640
<v Speaker 1>personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you bring to every situation</v>

588
00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:18.480
<v Speaker 1>and the more sophisticated you are in </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to yourself and others,</v>

589
00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:19.923
<v Speaker 1>the more you understand people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the deeper you understand the nature of </v>

590
00:39:23.531 --> 00:39:24.364
<v Speaker 1>your own being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more likely it is that you're going </v>

591
00:39:27.131 --> 00:39:27.964
<v Speaker 1>to proceed through your life in a manner</v>
<v Speaker 1>that will make you pleased to exist </v>

592
00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:36.400
<v Speaker 1>rather than displeased to exist.</v>

593
00:39:37.390 --> 00:39:38.223
<v Speaker 1>I've collected the writings of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I regard as of in comparable </v>

594
00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:46.690
<v Speaker 1>brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're difficult to understand.</v>

595
00:39:47.170 --> 00:39:48.003
<v Speaker 1>Their concepts are complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not surprising because the </v>

596
00:39:51.131 --> 00:39:51.964
<v Speaker 1>subject matter is complex and vital and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so it requires work and I would say try </v>

597
00:39:57.641 --> 00:39:58.474
<v Speaker 1>to keep up on the readings if you would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to make the course much more </v>

598
00:40:02.110 --> 00:40:05.980
<v Speaker 1>much richer for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say because people often ask</v>

599
00:40:05.981 --> 00:40:08.110
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well how should I read for this course?</v>

600
00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:13.230
<v Speaker 1>Cause there's a lot of reading and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer is read as if it matters.</v>

601
00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:15.573
<v Speaker 1>That's the right answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't be thinking about how it's going </v>

602
00:40:18.011 --> 00:40:18.844
<v Speaker 1>to be tested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you do the readings and you come to </v>

603
00:40:20.111 --> 00:40:20.944
<v Speaker 1>the lectures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the tests aren't particularly </v>

604
00:40:23.410 --> 00:40:24.243
<v Speaker 1>difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you should read the readings as if </v>

605
00:40:27.731 --> 00:40:32.170
<v Speaker 1>the person is writing about you and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should try to understand what the person</v>

606
00:40:32.171 --> 00:40:34.810
<v Speaker 1>says because it's another tool for you </v>
<v Speaker 1>to use.</v>

607
00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:38.110
<v Speaker 1>And I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well with my clients,</v>

608
00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:39.273
<v Speaker 1>you know I use the approaches of one </v>
<v Speaker 1>theorist for one client and the </v>

609
00:40:41.741 --> 00:40:43.720
<v Speaker 1>approaches of another theorist for </v>
<v Speaker 1>another client.</v>

610
00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:44.793
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me to depend to some degree </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually on the temperament of the </v>

611
00:40:47.471 --> 00:40:49.510
<v Speaker 1>client.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found for example,</v>

612
00:40:49.511 --> 00:40:52.060
<v Speaker 1>that people who are very high in </v>
<v Speaker 1>openness,</v>

613
00:40:52.090 --> 00:40:52.923
<v Speaker 1>which is the creativity dimension,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are quite amenable to a young Ian </v>

614
00:40:57.250 --> 00:40:59.440
<v Speaker 1>Approach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas people who are more practical,</v>

615
00:40:59.441 --> 00:41:00.274
<v Speaker 1>conscientious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>low and openness are much more amenable </v>

616
00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:03.453
<v Speaker 1>to a behaviorist approach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't really know enough about </v>

617
00:41:05.681 --> 00:41:10.330
<v Speaker 1>psychology yet to match treatment to </v>
<v Speaker 1>temperament,</v>

618
00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:14.530
<v Speaker 1>but those are the some of the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I've experienced.</v>

619
00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:16.450
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Practicalities.</v>

620
00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:21.940
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a website I gave you the url,</v>

621
00:41:21.941 --> 00:41:23.530
<v Speaker 1>I'll put it up again at the end of </v>
<v Speaker 1>class.</v>

622
00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:25.233
<v Speaker 1>The Url lists all the readings that </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't in the textbook and so the </v>

623
00:41:28.481 --> 00:41:29.314
<v Speaker 1>textbook contains the classic readings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>readings from people like young and </v>

624
00:41:33.650 --> 00:41:36.950
<v Speaker 1>Freud and Piaget and so forth.</v>

625
00:41:37.310 --> 00:41:39.680
<v Speaker 1>Rogers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as I said,</v>

626
00:41:39.681 --> 00:41:40.514
<v Speaker 1>I picked that particular textbook </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I believe that the author did a </v>

627
00:41:44.331 --> 00:41:47.780
<v Speaker 1>very credible job of summarizing what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>very difficult to summarize.</v>

628
00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:49.153
<v Speaker 1>So and then also on the website there </v>
<v Speaker 1>are links to papers because much of the </v>

629
00:41:54.351 --> 00:41:55.184
<v Speaker 1>more modern material that pertains say </v>
<v Speaker 1>to neuroscience and also to trait </v>

630
00:41:59.481 --> 00:42:00.314
<v Speaker 1>personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's better just to read the </v>

631
00:42:02.361 --> 00:42:06.230
<v Speaker 1>original papers and all detailed them </v>
<v Speaker 1>out with you as we go through.</v>

632
00:42:06.231 --> 00:42:07.064
<v Speaker 1>And that'll also give you some </v>
<v Speaker 1>familiarity with original psychological </v>

633
00:42:09.441 --> 00:42:11.120
<v Speaker 1>papers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are,</v>

634
00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:12.890
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

635
00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:17.090
<v Speaker 1>there's an idiom that you have to master</v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to understand them,</v>

636
00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:18.373
<v Speaker 1>but you might as well practice it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're interested in </v>

637
00:42:21.321 --> 00:42:26.321
<v Speaker 1>continuing with psychology in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>educational practice or as a career.</v>

638
00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:30.710
<v Speaker 1>It's good to get accustomed to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

639
00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:38.880
<v Speaker 1>there again is the url for the class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go to Jordan b peterson.com which</v>

640
00:42:38.891 --> 00:42:42.310
<v Speaker 1>isn't too hard to remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assuming you can remember my name,</v>

641
00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:45.730
<v Speaker 1>then classes are listed on the left hand</v>
<v Speaker 1>side.</v>

642
00:42:45.731 --> 00:42:48.070
<v Speaker 1>You can just find the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the syllabus there.</v>

643
00:42:49.030 --> 00:42:49.863
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

644
00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:52.730
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so here's what we're going to cover.</v>

645
00:42:54.350 --> 00:42:55.183
<v Speaker 1>Well today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously this is the introduction and </v>

646
00:42:56.661 --> 00:42:57.494
<v Speaker 1>overview class is a little strange this </v>
<v Speaker 1>year because one day it's an hour and </v>

647
00:43:00.201 --> 00:43:01.034
<v Speaker 1>the next day it's two hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So not exactly sure how we're going to </v>

648
00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:06.020
<v Speaker 1>negotiate our way through that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we'll figure it out.</v>

649
00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:12.500
<v Speaker 1>Historical perspectives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mythological representations.</v>

650
00:43:12.501 --> 00:43:13.334
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told you that I would try to provide </v>

651
00:43:14.361 --> 00:43:15.194
<v Speaker 1>you with a Meta narrative that might </v>
<v Speaker 1>enable you to link the theories that </v>

652
00:43:20.001 --> 00:43:23.930
<v Speaker 1>we're going to talk about together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to describe to you what you</v>

653
00:43:23.931 --> 00:43:27.900
<v Speaker 1>might regard as a conceptual language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as far as I can tell,</v>

654
00:43:27.901 --> 00:43:28.734
<v Speaker 1>it's the imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine that there are two kinds of </v>

655
00:43:30.841 --> 00:43:35.340
<v Speaker 1>things that you need to know and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe this to be the case.</v>

656
00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:38.190
<v Speaker 1>I believe that you need to know what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world is made of.</v>

657
00:43:38.250 --> 00:43:40.920
<v Speaker 1>And I suppose that's the proper domain </v>
<v Speaker 1>of science,</v>

658
00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:42.293
<v Speaker 1>but then you need to know how to act and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a whole different thing and you </v>

659
00:43:46.381 --> 00:43:48.300
<v Speaker 1>need to know how to act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>

660
00:43:48.301 --> 00:43:49.134
<v Speaker 1>You need to know most of anything of </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything because of course you're a </v>

661
00:43:51.571 --> 00:43:56.571
<v Speaker 1>living creature and action in </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to desired goals is,</v>

662
00:43:57.240 --> 00:43:58.500
<v Speaker 1>is everything to you.</v>

663
00:43:58.500 --> 00:44:01.260
<v Speaker 1>And you can think about that from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Darwinian perspective.</v>

664
00:44:01.261 --> 00:44:02.094
<v Speaker 1>You have to act at least so that you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>survive at least so that you can find a </v>

665
00:44:05.641 --> 00:44:08.400
<v Speaker 1>partner that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's life.</v>

666
00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:10.470
<v Speaker 1>And so part of the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

667
00:44:10.471 --> 00:44:15.030
<v Speaker 1>how does the world look?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you think about it as a place to act,</v>

668
00:44:15.390 --> 00:44:19.770
<v Speaker 1>and the answer isn't a place of value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Free objects,</v>

669
00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:20.843
<v Speaker 1>that's not what the world looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can't act in a world of value </v>

670
00:44:24.601 --> 00:44:28.170
<v Speaker 1>free objects because there's no way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>choosing between them.</v>

671
00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:33.030
<v Speaker 1>If everything has zero value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why you choose one thing over another.</v>

672
00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:34.073
<v Speaker 1>You live in a world where things present</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves to you as of different value </v>

673
00:44:39.450 --> 00:44:41.730
<v Speaker 1>and that's partly a consequence of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>temperament,</v>

674
00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:43.620
<v Speaker 1>although it's a consequence of other </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

675
00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:49.100
<v Speaker 1>And so what I'm going to try to do is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>provide you with a Schema that describes</v>

676
00:44:49.891 --> 00:44:53.190
<v Speaker 1>the world of morality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

677
00:44:53.191 --> 00:44:54.024
<v Speaker 1>which is how to act and tell you a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit about what I think the </v>

678
00:44:57.241 --> 00:45:00.000
<v Speaker 1>languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think was derived from Darwinian</v>

679
00:45:00.210 --> 00:45:01.080
<v Speaker 1>processes.</v>

680
00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:02.273
<v Speaker 1>And I believe that it's within that </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure that the clinical theories </v>

681
00:45:05.071 --> 00:45:08.820
<v Speaker 1>logically nest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that'll give you a way of linking</v>

682
00:45:08.821 --> 00:45:09.654
<v Speaker 1>one theory to another from a conceptual </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective without having to rely so </v>

683
00:45:14.341 --> 00:45:15.174
<v Speaker 1>much on sheer memorization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we'll talk about heroic and </v>

684
00:45:18.001 --> 00:45:21.150
<v Speaker 1>shamanic initiations and the reason </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to do that is because,</v>

685
00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:26.040
<v Speaker 1>well people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people use shamonic initiations for tens</v>

686
00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:26.873
<v Speaker 1>of thousands of years all over the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they have a particular kind of </v>

687
00:45:28.351 --> 00:45:31.530
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The paper by Murcia Ellie Outta which is</v>

688
00:45:31.531 --> 00:45:32.364
<v Speaker 1>linked on the site is a very interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>one in details out some of these </v>

689
00:45:35.521 --> 00:45:37.060
<v Speaker 1>processes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

690
00:45:37.110 --> 00:45:37.943
<v Speaker 1>there have been intelligent commentators</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Henri ellenberger or Jay who wrote </v>

691
00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:44.790
<v Speaker 1>the discovery of the unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is an outstanding book,</v>

692
00:45:45.210 --> 00:45:48.510
<v Speaker 1>who linked the processes that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalysts,</v>

693
00:45:48.511 --> 00:45:49.344
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalysts uncovered in the late </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the 19th century and early part </v>

694
00:45:53.641 --> 00:45:58.140
<v Speaker 1>of the 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to these more primordial rituals of</v>

695
00:45:58.141 --> 00:45:59.700
<v Speaker 1>personality transformation.</v>

696
00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:04.700
<v Speaker 1>And so we're going to situate ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense in deep history,</v>

697
00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:10.320
<v Speaker 1>talking first about the underlying </v>
<v Speaker 1>mythological landscape,</v>

698
00:46:10.590 --> 00:46:14.160
<v Speaker 1>then talking about archaic modes of </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality,</v>

699
00:46:14.161 --> 00:46:14.994
<v Speaker 1>conceptualization and transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then moving from there into </v>

700
00:46:18.451 --> 00:46:22.050
<v Speaker 1>constructivism and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're going to concentrate mostly on</v>

701
00:46:22.051 --> 00:46:24.600
<v Speaker 1>John Piaget,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was a developmental psychologist.</v>

702
00:46:25.650 --> 00:46:29.610
<v Speaker 1>Constructivists believe that you make </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself out of the information that you</v>

703
00:46:29.611 --> 00:46:32.280
<v Speaker 1>gather in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're an exploring creature.</v>

704
00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:33.383
<v Speaker 1>You explore specifically when the maps </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're using in the world are no </v>

705
00:46:36.631 --> 00:46:39.750
<v Speaker 1>longer orienting yourself properly when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're producing errors.</v>

706
00:46:39.751 --> 00:46:40.584
<v Speaker 1>You'd go out and gather information and </v>
<v Speaker 1>assemble yourself from the information </v>

707
00:46:43.981 --> 00:46:46.160
<v Speaker 1>that you discovered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the depths,</v>

708
00:46:46.161 --> 00:46:48.120
<v Speaker 1>psychologists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>young and Freud,</v>

709
00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:49.373
<v Speaker 1>I think I am going to with young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to walk you through some </v>

710
00:46:54.241 --> 00:46:57.450
<v Speaker 1>films.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to use the films per se.</v>

711
00:46:57.451 --> 00:47:00.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to use clips stills from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>film,</v>

712
00:47:00.601 --> 00:47:02.370
<v Speaker 1>but in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the film.</v>

713
00:47:02.370 --> 00:47:03.203
<v Speaker 1>So in chronological order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to try to explain to you </v>

714
00:47:08.490 --> 00:47:13.490
<v Speaker 1>how you might use union presuppositions </v>
<v Speaker 1>to understand what the films are about.</v>

715
00:47:14.250 --> 00:47:15.690
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you think about a film,</v>

716
00:47:15.691 --> 00:47:16.524
<v Speaker 1>say like the Lion King,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was an extraordinarily popular </v>

717
00:47:18.301 --> 00:47:19.134
<v Speaker 1>film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very strange phenomena that you </v>

718
00:47:21.181 --> 00:47:23.100
<v Speaker 1>go and watch it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

719
00:47:23.101 --> 00:47:24.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about it,</v>

720
00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:29.600
<v Speaker 1>it's drawings of animated animals that </v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense you,</v>

721
00:47:31.150 --> 00:47:31.983
<v Speaker 1>they're very low resolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you perceive them immediately as </v>

722
00:47:35.321 --> 00:47:39.160
<v Speaker 1>living things and you attribute to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation and,</v>

723
00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:42.070
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and motive power and understanding.</v>

724
00:47:42.071 --> 00:47:44.080
<v Speaker 1>You do it automatically without even </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about it.</v>

725
00:47:44.081 --> 00:47:48.070
<v Speaker 1>And there's a classic plot that lies </v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath those stories.</v>

726
00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:49.720
<v Speaker 1>And the plots are very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

727
00:47:49.721 --> 00:47:51.190
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very old.</v>

728
00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:52.653
<v Speaker 1>And that's why you can understand them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason you can understand them </v>

729
00:47:55.181 --> 00:47:58.570
<v Speaker 1>is because life has a plot or maybe it </v>
<v Speaker 1>has a couple of plots,</v>

730
00:47:58.571 --> 00:48:01.110
<v Speaker 1>a multitude of plots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but life has a,</v>

731
00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:02.133
<v Speaker 1>and if it didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we wouldn't be able to understand each </v>

732
00:48:03.131 --> 00:48:03.850
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

733
00:48:03.850 --> 00:48:04.683
<v Speaker 1>And so I'd like to illustrate that for </v>
<v Speaker 1>you by an analysis of some of these </v>

734
00:48:08.231 --> 00:48:09.064
<v Speaker 1>films.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the best way to understand </v>

735
00:48:11.681 --> 00:48:15.760
<v Speaker 1>someone as sophisticated as young who is</v>
<v Speaker 1>very difficult to get a handle on.</v>

736
00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:18.250
<v Speaker 1>Freud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do the same thing,</v>

737
00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:20.230
<v Speaker 1>although I am going to show you a film </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Freud.</v>

738
00:48:20.231 --> 00:48:22.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to show you a film called </v>
<v Speaker 1>Crumb,</v>

739
00:48:22.450 --> 00:48:23.283
<v Speaker 1>which is a documentary and it's about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very badly in meshed family and the </v>

740
00:48:28.721 --> 00:48:31.780
<v Speaker 1>attempts of the family members too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose escape it.</v>

741
00:48:32.050 --> 00:48:34.030
<v Speaker 1>I'll talk to you about Freud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll show you the film.</v>

742
00:48:34.031 --> 00:48:36.460
<v Speaker 1>That should give you a sense of Friday </v>
<v Speaker 1>and psychopathology,</v>

743
00:48:36.461 --> 00:48:39.190
<v Speaker 1>which is a very difficult thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise to understand.</v>

744
00:48:40.690 --> 00:48:43.480
<v Speaker 1>Then there's a midterm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Midterm is multiple choice.</v>

745
00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:45.880
<v Speaker 1>You'll do it in class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll,</v>

746
00:48:45.881 --> 00:48:49.360
<v Speaker 1>you'll have lots of time to finish it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll cover the material that we took.</v>

747
00:48:49.610 --> 00:48:53.560
<v Speaker 1>We studied up to that point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we're going to talk about Rogers.</v>

748
00:48:53.620 --> 00:48:55.450
<v Speaker 1>Carl Rogers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was a humanist.</v>

749
00:48:56.920 --> 00:49:00.040
<v Speaker 1>Rogers has a body centered philosophy I </v>
<v Speaker 1>suppose,</v>

750
00:49:00.041 --> 00:49:03.640
<v Speaker 1>and he's interested as well in optimal </v>
<v Speaker 1>personal development.</v>

751
00:49:03.641 --> 00:49:04.474
<v Speaker 1>And the role that interpersonal </v>
<v Speaker 1>communication plays in that Rogers </v>

752
00:49:07.271 --> 00:49:10.090
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a very interesting one,</v>

753
00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:11.463
<v Speaker 1>is that honest communication between two</v>
<v Speaker 1>people can produce personality </v>

754
00:49:14.741 --> 00:49:16.260
<v Speaker 1>transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>

755
00:49:16.261 --> 00:49:17.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think,</v>

756
00:49:17.711 --> 00:49:18.544
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you kind of know that already because </v>

757
00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:22.780
<v Speaker 1>there's something very engaging about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>deep,</v>

758
00:49:22.781 --> 00:49:23.614
<v Speaker 1>honest conversation where you're able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>say things that you wouldn't normally </v>

759
00:49:26.771 --> 00:49:27.604
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you're being listened to by </v>

760
00:49:29.321 --> 00:49:30.154
<v Speaker 1>someone who's actually listening to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're listening to them and in the </v>

761
00:49:32.891 --> 00:49:36.910
<v Speaker 1>conversation you're moving both of you </v>
<v Speaker 1>further to a different point.</v>

762
00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:38.013
<v Speaker 1>That's different than a conversation </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you're right and you're trying to </v>

763
00:49:40.061 --> 00:49:42.970
<v Speaker 1>convince me or I'm right and I'm trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to convince you,</v>

764
00:49:42.971 --> 00:49:45.100
<v Speaker 1>which I would say is the typical </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>

765
00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:48.100
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the healing conversation is more,</v>

766
00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:49.930
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's up with you?</v>

767
00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:50.940
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are you doing?</v>

768
00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:52.380
<v Speaker 1>How's your life going?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where,</v>

769
00:49:52.381 --> 00:49:55.630
<v Speaker 1>what sort of problems are you facing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think about those problems?</v>

770
00:49:56.050 --> 00:49:58.390
<v Speaker 1>Can you conceptualize what a solution </v>
<v Speaker 1>might be?</v>

771
00:49:58.540 --> 00:50:00.520
<v Speaker 1>Is there a way we could figure out how </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get there?</v>

772
00:50:00.910 --> 00:50:01.541
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so,</v>

773
00:50:01.541 --> 00:50:02.374
<v Speaker 1>it's a problem solving conversation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's predicated on the presupposition </v>

774
00:50:06.041 --> 00:50:06.874
<v Speaker 1>that the person that you're conversing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with has the capacity to grow in a </v>

775
00:50:09.701 --> 00:50:13.210
<v Speaker 1>positive direction if they so choose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the fundamental,</v>

776
00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:14.793
<v Speaker 1>that's the fundamental presupposition of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rogerian psychology may and frankly are </v>

777
00:50:19.211 --> 00:50:22.350
<v Speaker 1>also humanists</v>
<v Speaker 1>all finished.</v>

778
00:50:22.351 --> 00:50:24.850
<v Speaker 1>Tell you what the rest of the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the material is.</v>

779
00:50:24.851 --> 00:50:26.920
<v Speaker 1>The next time that we meet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should show you,</v>

780
00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:29.660
<v Speaker 1>let you know a little bit more about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure of the course.</v>

781
00:50:30.110 --> 00:50:30.943
<v Speaker 1>The second midterm is March 14th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the and there's a final at the end as </v>

782
00:50:36.381 --> 00:50:37.214
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

783
00:50:39.110 --> 00:50:39.943
<v Speaker 1>So the mid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the multiple choice tests are graded in </v>

784
00:50:42.051 --> 00:50:42.884
<v Speaker 1>that manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>25% 25% and 27.5% they're not </v>

785
00:50:47.301 --> 00:50:48.134
<v Speaker 1>cumulative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each test only covers what you covered </v>

786
00:50:51.081 --> 00:50:52.880
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since the last test,</v>

787
00:50:52.881 --> 00:50:53.714
<v Speaker 1>including the final,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll be required to write an essay of </v>

788
00:50:56.211 --> 00:50:58.850
<v Speaker 1>15%.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a thousand words,</v>

789
00:50:58.851 --> 00:51:00.770
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not 750 words.</v>

790
00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:04.970
<v Speaker 1>And you'll also do an online exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a personality analysis,</v>

791
00:51:05.590 --> 00:51:07.880
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is pass fail.</v>

792
00:51:07.881 --> 00:51:10.700
<v Speaker 1>All you have to do is complete it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>show proof of completion.</v>

793
00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:15.560
<v Speaker 1>It helps you do a modified big five </v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis of your own personality,</v>

794
00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:18.770
<v Speaker 1>concentrating on your virtues and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>faults.</v>

795
00:51:18.771 --> 00:51:19.970
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

796
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:20.833
<v Speaker 1>so it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an active exercise in the </v>

797
00:51:23.241 --> 00:51:27.260
<v Speaker 1>application of personality theory to </v>
<v Speaker 1>personal development.</v>

798
00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:30.800
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the structure of the course.</v>

799
00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:32.840
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you</v>

800
00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:39.380
<v Speaker 1>there's a signup sheet on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the syllabus.</v>

801
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:41.833
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've broken the essays down into </v>

802
00:51:42.921 --> 00:51:45.050
<v Speaker 1>multiple types across the entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>semester.</v>

803
00:51:45.050 --> 00:51:47.540
<v Speaker 1>I would highly recommend that you go </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and sign up.</v>

804
00:51:47.570 --> 00:51:51.950
<v Speaker 1>There are limited slots for each topic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is,</v>

805
00:51:52.190 --> 00:51:53.023
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want my ta to have to grade 200 </v>

806
00:51:54.411 --> 00:51:55.244
<v Speaker 1>essays the last week of classes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to spread them out across the </v>

807
00:51:57.950 --> 00:52:02.300
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So figure out a topic and sign up please</v>

808
00:52:02.301 --> 00:52:04.430
<v Speaker 1>and please do that sooner rather than </v>
<v Speaker 1>later.</v>

809
00:52:04.431 --> 00:52:06.650
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an industrious thing to do.</v>

810
00:52:06.950 --> 00:52:07.783
<v Speaker 1>It'll help you organize yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll post something that's quite useful </v>

811
00:52:11.571 --> 00:52:12.404
<v Speaker 1>about how to write,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially a thousand word essay and </v>

812
00:52:15.741 --> 00:52:19.250
<v Speaker 1>I'll close the essays are due one day </v>
<v Speaker 1>before class.</v>

813
00:52:19.580 --> 00:52:20.413
<v Speaker 1>Oh close by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by telling you who shouldn't take this </v>

814
00:52:23.961 --> 00:52:25.040
<v Speaker 1>course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

815
00:52:25.730 --> 00:52:26.563
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you didn't like this lecture then </v>

816
00:52:28.701 --> 00:52:32.690
<v Speaker 1>don't take this course because this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>what the lectures are going to be like.</v>

817
00:52:33.170 --> 00:52:35.450
<v Speaker 1>So and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not for everybody.</v>

818
00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:36.913
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I use a lot of loose associations and </v>

819
00:52:39.171 --> 00:52:43.370
<v Speaker 1>try to gather them back in and I kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>wander around that way.</v>

820
00:52:43.370 --> 00:52:45.680
<v Speaker 1>I can talk directly to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I like doing,</v>

821
00:52:45.681 --> 00:52:48.590
<v Speaker 1>but I sacrifice a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization for that.</v>

822
00:52:49.010 --> 00:52:52.040
<v Speaker 1>But my sense is that it's worth the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice.</v>

823
00:52:52.430 --> 00:52:57.430
<v Speaker 1>The second thing is there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reading a lot and a lot of it is,</v>

824
00:52:58.190 --> 00:53:02.750
<v Speaker 1>I would say a lot of it's hard science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last half in particular,</v>

825
00:53:02.990 --> 00:53:06.290
<v Speaker 1>but the first half of a lot of its </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophical in nature,</v>

826
00:53:06.291 --> 00:53:07.310
<v Speaker 1>philosophical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slash,</v>

827
00:53:07.311 --> 00:53:11.210
<v Speaker 1>psychological.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're not interested in that,</v>

828
00:53:11.450 --> 00:53:12.283
<v Speaker 1>like if you're a pure science type and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not interested in the clinical </v>

829
00:53:16.521 --> 00:53:19.340
<v Speaker 1>elements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say of personality and in the,</v>

830
00:53:19.420 --> 00:53:20.253
<v Speaker 1>and in investigating the philosophical </v>
<v Speaker 1>underpinnings of those clinical </v>

831
00:53:23.241 --> 00:53:24.074
<v Speaker 1>theories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I would say this isn't the course </v>

832
00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:26.153
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you should take that seriously </v>

833
00:53:27.991 --> 00:53:28.824
<v Speaker 1>because the readings are hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of work involved in this </v>

834
00:53:30.811 --> 00:53:31.644
<v Speaker 1>course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it would be better if you took a </v>

835
00:53:33.361 --> 00:53:36.510
<v Speaker 1>course that you actually wanted to take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

836
00:53:37.050 --> 00:53:37.883
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>welcome to psychology to 30 and we'll </v>

837
00:53:39.781 --> 00:53:40.614
<v Speaker 1>see you in a bit</v>

838
00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:45.140
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
