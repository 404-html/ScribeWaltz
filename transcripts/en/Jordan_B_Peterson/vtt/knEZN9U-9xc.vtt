1
00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:01.583
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.010
<v Speaker 2>one of the fundamental thesis of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>course is that</v>

3
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.530
<v Speaker 2>in modern literature and the literature </v>
<v Speaker 2>that isn't so modern,</v>

4
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.660
<v Speaker 2>there's the notion of a human created </v>
<v Speaker 2>monster Frankenstein,</v>

5
00:00:47.661 --> 00:00:50.150
<v Speaker 2>right springs to mind and at an adequate</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

6
00:00:50.151 --> 00:00:53.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean Frankenstein was a fantasy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>unconscious fantasy,</v>

7
00:00:53.391 --> 00:00:54.224
<v Speaker 2>a dream in actuality about the potential</v>
<v Speaker 2>dangers of unbridled technological </v>

8
00:00:58.731 --> 00:00:59.660
<v Speaker 2>advancement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

9
00:00:59.661 --> 00:01:03.110
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this Frankenstein a monster's face,</v>

10
00:01:03.111 --> 00:01:03.944
<v Speaker 2>so daily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's become a constant part of </v>

11
00:01:05.661 --> 00:01:08.000
<v Speaker 2>our existence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is that?</v>

12
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.193
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's something like this and this </v>

13
00:01:10.401 --> 00:01:13.700
<v Speaker 2>is certainly a notion that young would </v>
<v Speaker 2>agree with,</v>

14
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.103
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

15
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.153
<v Speaker 2>if we don't develop a moral sense as </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscious and is elaborated as our </v>

16
00:01:22.231 --> 00:01:23.064
<v Speaker 2>technological sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that we're capable of becoming </v>

17
00:01:26.851 --> 00:01:30.200
<v Speaker 2>increasingly powerful will necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>do us in</v>

18
00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:33.783
<v Speaker 2>the bigger your weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the smarter you better be to control </v>

19
00:01:37.201 --> 00:01:40.320
<v Speaker 2>them and so maybe it is something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>this maybe,</v>

20
00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:41.443
<v Speaker 2>and this is a strict union notion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe 500 years ago when we started to </v>

21
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.363
<v Speaker 2>ratchet up the rate at which we were </v>
<v Speaker 2>developing our technological expertise </v>

22
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:51.803
<v Speaker 2>and left our mythological and religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>presuppositions and conceptions behind </v>

23
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.260
<v Speaker 2>as archaic and perhaps as predicated on </v>
<v Speaker 2>superstition.</v>

24
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.640
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we need to spend as much time </v>
<v Speaker 2>updating them and bringing them into the</v>

25
00:02:05.641 --> 00:02:06.474
<v Speaker 2>domain of clear consciousness and </v>
<v Speaker 2>control as we have spent on developing </v>

26
00:02:10.051 --> 00:02:11.490
<v Speaker 2>our technological sense.</v>

27
00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.140
<v Speaker 2>If you were a medieval Christian or an </v>
<v Speaker 2>archaic religious thinker of any sort,</v>

28
00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.003
<v Speaker 2>you're first presupposition was that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world and the cosmos existed exactly as </v>

29
00:02:24.251 --> 00:02:25.084
<v Speaker 2>they appeared,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which with you or at least your village </v>

30
00:02:27.671 --> 00:02:28.504
<v Speaker 2>or town or country out the center and </v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly with the Earth at the center </v>

31
00:02:32.351 --> 00:02:33.184
<v Speaker 2>and with the cosmos as a shield around </v>
<v Speaker 2>the earth and with the earth itself as </v>

32
00:02:37.241 --> 00:02:40.480
<v Speaker 2>the domain of man being the fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 2>attribute of the cosmos.</v>

33
00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.673
<v Speaker 2>So this is a quotation from young and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's when I like a lot because I think </v>

34
00:02:46.961 --> 00:02:47.794
<v Speaker 2>it adequately and succinctly describes </v>
<v Speaker 2>the distinction between the way that </v>

35
00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.580
<v Speaker 2>modern people think and the way that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people think.</v>

36
00:02:57.581 --> 00:03:00.730
<v Speaker 2>If they're still ensconced within </v>
<v Speaker 2>traditional belief form.</v>

37
00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.690
<v Speaker 2>How totally did the different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did the world appear to medieval man?</v>

38
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.003
<v Speaker 2>For him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Earth was eternally fixed and it </v>

39
00:03:07.561 --> 00:03:08.394
<v Speaker 2>rest in the center of the universe and </v>
<v Speaker 2>circled by the course of a son that's </v>

40
00:03:11.581 --> 00:03:13.480
<v Speaker 2>solicitously bestowed.</v>

41
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.480
<v Speaker 2>It's warm despite the fact that pre </v>
<v Speaker 2>empirical people have to deal with death</v>

42
00:03:18.581 --> 00:03:22.060
<v Speaker 2>and disease on a scale that I think is </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely unknown to us.</v>

43
00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:23.343
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't seem unreasonable to </v>
<v Speaker 2>presuppose that there was a certain </v>

44
00:03:25.301 --> 00:03:28.000
<v Speaker 2>degree of comfort to be found in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>worldview of this sort,</v>

45
00:03:28.001 --> 00:03:28.834
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it appeared at least to the </v>

46
00:03:30.491 --> 00:03:31.324
<v Speaker 2>casual observer that the cosmos was </v>
<v Speaker 2>human centric and that the notion that </v>

47
00:03:37.631 --> 00:03:38.464
<v Speaker 2>human purpose was in some way associated</v>
<v Speaker 2>with cosmic significance seem to be </v>

48
00:03:43.631 --> 00:03:44.464
<v Speaker 2>beyond question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least in part because there were no </v>

49
00:03:46.211 --> 00:03:50.410
<v Speaker 2>theories of reality that would compete </v>
<v Speaker 2>with that initial preconception.</v>

50
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:51.813
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're all children of God under the </v>

51
00:03:52.781 --> 00:03:53.614
<v Speaker 2>loving care of the most high who </v>
<v Speaker 2>prepared them for eternal blessedness </v>

52
00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.963
<v Speaker 2>and all knew exactly what they should do</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how they should conduct themselves </v>

53
00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.180
<v Speaker 2>in order to rise from a corruptible </v>
<v Speaker 2>world to an incorruptible.</v>

54
00:04:04.181 --> 00:04:09.070
<v Speaker 2>Enjoy US existence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Such a life no longer seems real to us.</v>

55
00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.963
<v Speaker 2>Even in our dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Natural sciences long ago torn this </v>

56
00:04:13.691 --> 00:04:14.524
<v Speaker 2>lovely veil to shreds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How is it that people could think that </v>

57
00:04:17.771 --> 00:04:18.604
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>given that it was so wrong and still </v>

58
00:04:20.111 --> 00:04:22.780
<v Speaker 2>survive?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Given that in large part,</v>

59
00:04:22.781 --> 00:04:25.660
<v Speaker 2>we are necessary necessarily creatures </v>
<v Speaker 2>of tradition.</v>

60
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.823
<v Speaker 2>How is it that we can sever the ties </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the manner in which our ancestors </v>

61
00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.993
<v Speaker 2>thought</v>

62
00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.761
<v Speaker 2>and suffer?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

63
00:04:34.761 --> 00:04:39.761
<v Speaker 2>we'll consequences in result people </v>
<v Speaker 2>think automatically and I think for good</v>

64
00:04:40.041 --> 00:04:40.874
<v Speaker 2>reasons that the march of human thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>has been unbroken progress towards </v>

65
00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:48.710
<v Speaker 2>increased rationality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>increased power,</v>

66
00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:49.663
<v Speaker 2>increased clarity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's certainly the case that as a </v>

67
00:04:51.501 --> 00:04:52.334
<v Speaker 2>consequence of sacrifice of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious beliefs and are full of </v>

68
00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:55.653
<v Speaker 2>philosophical beliefs that problems of </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning have become more paramount for </v>

69
00:04:59.031 --> 00:05:00.620
<v Speaker 2>the modern person and then you might </v>
<v Speaker 2>ask,</v>

70
00:05:00.621 --> 00:05:01.454
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what exactly are the consequences of </v>

71
00:05:02.361 --> 00:05:03.194
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think initially the best </v>

72
00:05:05.691 --> 00:05:08.180
<v Speaker 2>perspective to take is one that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>historical.</v>

73
00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:14.030
<v Speaker 2>As we've moved away from a classical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mystical or mythological worldview,</v>

74
00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.900
<v Speaker 2>a number of dramatic occurrences of </v>
<v Speaker 2>unfolded,</v>

75
00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.110
<v Speaker 2>we've become much more technologically </v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful,</v>

76
00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:24.243
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The application of a strict empirical </v>

77
00:05:25.841 --> 00:05:26.674
<v Speaker 2>model designed to abstract out from </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's experiment experience those </v>

78
00:05:30.641 --> 00:05:33.910
<v Speaker 2>things that are material and constant </v>
<v Speaker 2>have enabled us to produce</v>

79
00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.650
<v Speaker 2>technological implements of extreme </v>
<v Speaker 2>power,</v>

80
00:05:38.651 --> 00:05:39.820
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both for good,</v>

81
00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:40.863
<v Speaker 2>at least in principle with regards to </v>
<v Speaker 2>medical advances and also for eal in </v>

82
00:05:44.321 --> 00:05:48.940
<v Speaker 2>terms of our ability to control weapons </v>
<v Speaker 2>of unbelievable destructive force,</v>

83
00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.670
<v Speaker 2>so we're more powerful hardware.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any smarter or any wiser?</v>

84
00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:56.213
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a casual glance at the history </v>

85
00:05:57.381 --> 00:05:59.960
<v Speaker 2>of the 20th century was suggest that </v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps we're not.</v>

86
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's any indication </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever,</v>

87
00:06:02.241 --> 00:06:03.074
<v Speaker 2>although perhaps things have improved in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last 15 years that an additional </v>

88
00:06:07.221 --> 00:06:08.054
<v Speaker 2>consequence of our capacity to extract </v>
<v Speaker 2>ourselves from our religious modes of </v>

89
00:06:12.501 --> 00:06:13.334
<v Speaker 2>thought has been a palpable increase in </v>
<v Speaker 2>wisdom or tolerance or compassion or a </v>

90
00:06:17.781 --> 00:06:18.614
<v Speaker 2>palpable increase in our ability to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand explicitly what might </v>

91
00:06:21.321 --> 00:06:24.830
<v Speaker 2>constitute the basis for a suitable and </v>
<v Speaker 2>stable state.</v>

92
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:28.693
<v Speaker 2>So you might take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example the fact that the 20th </v>

93
00:06:30.081 --> 00:06:33.380
<v Speaker 2>century has been unbelievably bloody </v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

94
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:34.423
<v Speaker 2>Literally hundreds of millions of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>killed in conflicts of one form or </v>

95
00:06:37.491 --> 00:06:40.520
<v Speaker 2>another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both external say in the course of world</v>

96
00:06:40.521 --> 00:06:45.521
<v Speaker 2>war two or Vietnam and internal in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>case of Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union</v>

97
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:50.900
<v Speaker 2>or any of the vast array of countries </v>
<v Speaker 2>who've subjected they're citizens too.</v>

98
00:06:50.901 --> 00:06:55.250
<v Speaker 2>Terrible internal repression in the name</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the maintenance of order.</v>

99
00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:56.413
<v Speaker 2>They Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn estimated </v>
<v Speaker 2>that 60 million people died in the </v>

100
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:01.063
<v Speaker 2>Soviet Union between 19,</v>
<v Speaker 2>19 in 1959 as a consequence of internal </v>

101
00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:05.053
<v Speaker 2>repression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and his estimates were that perhaps </v>

102
00:07:07.221 --> 00:07:10.280
<v Speaker 2>twice that many died during the cultural</v>
<v Speaker 2>revolution in China.</v>

103
00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:15.930
<v Speaker 2>Looking back on the 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one seat,</v>

104
00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.240
<v Speaker 2>one thing seems relatively clear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

105
00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:21.043
<v Speaker 2>Although</v>
<v Speaker 2>humanity as a whole has ceased or had </v>

106
00:07:27.561 --> 00:07:30.860
<v Speaker 2>ceased at least to engage in large scale</v>
<v Speaker 2>religious conflicts.</v>

107
00:07:30.861 --> 00:07:35.600
<v Speaker 2>Although they seem to have been making a</v>
<v Speaker 2>vicious comeback in the last five years.</v>

108
00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:38.433
<v Speaker 2>Our ability to live together still seems</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredibly compromised by our capacity </v>

109
00:07:42.791 --> 00:07:45.640
<v Speaker 2>to engage in ideological conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

110
00:07:45.641 --> 00:07:49.120
<v Speaker 2>And it doesn't seem to me ridiculous to </v>
<v Speaker 2>presume</v>

111
00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.030
<v Speaker 2>that the battles between capitalism and </v>
<v Speaker 2>communism say,</v>

112
00:07:54.031 --> 00:07:54.864
<v Speaker 2>or between capitalism and Communism and </v>
<v Speaker 2>fascism or even the emergent struggle </v>

113
00:07:58.921 --> 00:07:59.754
<v Speaker 2>between fundamentalist Islam and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>West can necessarily be regarded as </v>

114
00:08:04.891 --> 00:08:05.724
<v Speaker 2>anything but extensions of our tendency </v>
<v Speaker 2>towards religious and mythological </v>

115
00:08:08.341 --> 00:08:09.174
<v Speaker 2>conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though in principle systems like </v>

116
00:08:11.341 --> 00:08:12.174
<v Speaker 2>Communism and fascism were not </v>
<v Speaker 2>predicated on explicitly religious </v>

117
00:08:15.181 --> 00:08:20.181
<v Speaker 2>presuppositions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

118
00:08:21.781 --> 00:08:22.614
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me that the logical </v>
<v Speaker 2>conclusion from observations of that </v>

119
00:08:26.341 --> 00:08:27.174
<v Speaker 2>sword is that even if you eradicate the </v>
<v Speaker 2>traditional trappings of a mythological </v>

120
00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.033
<v Speaker 2>worldview,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which seems to be what's happened as a </v>

121
00:08:33.391 --> 00:08:36.210
<v Speaker 2>consequence of our rise in empirical </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge,</v>

122
00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:40.170
<v Speaker 2>that you don't eradicate the tendency </v>
<v Speaker 2>for people to formulate groups,</v>

123
00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:42.000
<v Speaker 2>belief systems</v>

124
00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:48.560
<v Speaker 2>around conceptions of ways that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>should behave that are at the very least</v>

125
00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:53.340
<v Speaker 2>religious instructor and action,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if they're not religious and name.</v>

126
00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:54.213
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a very peculiar </v>

127
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:56.850
<v Speaker 2>coincidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

128
00:08:56.851 --> 00:09:01.851
<v Speaker 2>that the Soviet communists erected a </v>
<v Speaker 2>male Trinity Marx,</v>

129
00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:04.493
<v Speaker 2>Lenin and Stalin as an apparent </v>
<v Speaker 2>replacement for the masculine trinity </v>

130
00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:13.850
<v Speaker 2>that comprised the essential duties of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Orthodox Russian Orthodox Christianity.</v>

131
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:19.920
<v Speaker 2>Why would these forms reemerged so </v>
<v Speaker 2>spontaneously and what does it mean that</v>

132
00:09:19.921 --> 00:09:20.754
<v Speaker 2>people who regard themselves as </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially modern and empirical in </v>

133
00:09:24.091 --> 00:09:24.924
<v Speaker 2>their presuppositions seem to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely susceptible in their </v>

134
00:09:29.401 --> 00:09:34.401
<v Speaker 2>fundament to ideological claims?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll let you look at the Soviet Union,</v>

135
00:09:34.441 --> 00:09:37.710
<v Speaker 2>which I think is very instructive case </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the Soviets,</v>

136
00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:38.633
<v Speaker 2>the Russians who really the last </v>
<v Speaker 2>European power to fall prey to the </v>

137
00:09:42.901 --> 00:09:46.410
<v Speaker 2>conflict between empiricism and science </v>
<v Speaker 2>and religion,</v>

138
00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:50.550
<v Speaker 2>and they didn't really fall prey to that</v>
<v Speaker 2>until the mid 18 hundreds because Russia</v>

139
00:09:50.551 --> 00:09:53.820
<v Speaker 2>was a relatively close society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>relatively illiterate,</v>

140
00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:54.873
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maintaining a medieval structure far </v>

141
00:09:57.481 --> 00:09:58.314
<v Speaker 2>past the time when other European </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries had abandoned that in the 18 </v>

142
00:10:03.091 --> 00:10:03.924
<v Speaker 2>fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a wave of atheism spread across Russia </v>

143
00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:09.750
<v Speaker 2>in some sense as a wave of </v>
<v Speaker 2>enlightenment,</v>

144
00:10:09.751 --> 00:10:14.751
<v Speaker 2>but also as a plague and figures as</v>
<v Speaker 2>towering as tolstoy</v>

145
00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:22.770
<v Speaker 2>remembered in his memoirs.</v>

146
00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:23.923
<v Speaker 2>The very day that he realized that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>empirical discoveries of western </v>

147
00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:33.060
<v Speaker 2>Europeans had eradicated his ability to </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe in the Russian Orthodox system.</v>

148
00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:36.690
<v Speaker 2>You lose something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happens?</v>

149
00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:37.793
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you believe that mythological </v>

150
00:10:40.051 --> 00:10:40.884
<v Speaker 2>thinking is nothing but superstitious </v>
<v Speaker 2>empiricism and that it's been replaced </v>

151
00:10:44.551 --> 00:10:46.920
<v Speaker 2>entirely by a more appropriate modern </v>
<v Speaker 2>view,</v>

152
00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:48.150
<v Speaker 2>then nothing happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

153
00:10:48.151 --> 00:10:51.060
<v Speaker 2>It's all to your benefit to become </v>
<v Speaker 2>enlightened.</v>

154
00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:52.133
<v Speaker 2>But if you believe that there's more to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the story than that and that more </v>

155
00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:55.763
<v Speaker 2>traditional ethical and moral systems </v>
<v Speaker 2>predicated on mythological </v>

156
00:10:58.981 --> 00:10:59.814
<v Speaker 2>presuppositions are for you a map of how</v>
<v Speaker 2>to behave and what to think and how to </v>

157
00:11:03.151 --> 00:11:05.790
<v Speaker 2>regulate your emotions and what to </v>
<v Speaker 2>strive for,</v>

158
00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:09.300
<v Speaker 2>none of which can be replaced by a </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientific perspective.</v>

159
00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:12.360
<v Speaker 2>And the eradication of a system like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that leaves a vacuum.</v>

160
00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:15.690
<v Speaker 2>And then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what rushes in to fill a vacuum?</v>

161
00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:16.883
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the case of the Soviet </v>

162
00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:20.090
<v Speaker 2>Union seems quite instructive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't it?</v>

163
00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:25.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a 30 year period where </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's tremendous intellectual clash,</v>

164
00:11:25.111 --> 00:11:29.430
<v Speaker 2>say between a materialist and empirical </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective.</v>

165
00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:30.413
<v Speaker 2>And in Russian Orthodox perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Russian Orthodox perspective loses </v>

166
00:11:35.581 --> 00:11:36.414
<v Speaker 2>its attractiveness for the reigning </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual elite and the </v>

167
00:11:39.751 --> 00:11:43.500
<v Speaker 2>presuppositions of communism which </v>
<v Speaker 2>appear rational by contrast,</v>

168
00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:47.310
<v Speaker 2>which by all evidence we're not rushing </v>
<v Speaker 2>to fill the gap.</v>

169
00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:50.280
<v Speaker 2>And I want to read you something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>nature wrote.</v>

170
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.530
<v Speaker 2>It's perhaps the most famous thing he </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever said.</v>

171
00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:56.810
<v Speaker 2>Although it's almost entirely taken out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of context and misquoted,</v>

172
00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:57.820
<v Speaker 2>and if not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ms dot quartered,</v>

173
00:11:57.821 --> 00:11:58.654
<v Speaker 2>at least misunderstood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because nature was one of these strange </v>

174
00:12:01.061 --> 00:12:05.290
<v Speaker 2>people who was capable of living 50 or </v>
<v Speaker 2>even 100 years into the future,</v>

175
00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:06.273
<v Speaker 2>and although he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is generally regarded as an enemy of </v>

176
00:12:09.491 --> 00:12:10.324
<v Speaker 2>Christianity and superstition and was </v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly an unbelievably outspoken </v>

177
00:12:13.631 --> 00:12:14.464
<v Speaker 2>opponent of Christian traditionalism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he also knew that if you let the old </v>

178
00:12:18.731 --> 00:12:19.564
<v Speaker 2>gods die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the probability that blood would flood </v>

179
00:12:22.211 --> 00:12:24.580
<v Speaker 2>the land was virtually 100 percent.</v>

180
00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:29.260
<v Speaker 2>So let me read you what he wrote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you not heard of that?</v>

181
00:12:29.261 --> 00:12:33.460
<v Speaker 2>Mad Man who lit a lantern in the bright </v>
<v Speaker 2>morning hours,</v>

182
00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:36.100
<v Speaker 2>ran to the market place and cried </v>
<v Speaker 2>incessantly.</v>

183
00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:41.620
<v Speaker 2>I seek God as many of those who do not </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe in God were standing around just</v>

184
00:12:41.621 --> 00:12:43.660
<v Speaker 2>then he provoked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Must much laughter.</v>

185
00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:47.020
<v Speaker 2>Why did he get lost?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Said one.</v>

186
00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:50.680
<v Speaker 2>Did he lose his way like a child said </v>
<v Speaker 2>another or is he hiding?</v>

187
00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:51.543
<v Speaker 2>Is he afraid of us?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because he'd gone on a voyage or </v>

188
00:12:53.141 --> 00:12:55.900
<v Speaker 2>immigrated that's the yelled and </v>
<v Speaker 2>laughed.</v>

189
00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:00.100
<v Speaker 2>The Madman jumped into their midst and </v>
<v Speaker 2>pierced them with his glances.</v>

190
00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:01.930
<v Speaker 2>Where there is God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he cried.</v>

191
00:13:01.931 --> 00:13:04.090
<v Speaker 2>I shall tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have killed him.</v>

192
00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:06.970
<v Speaker 2>You and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of us are as murderers,</v>

193
00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:11.680
<v Speaker 2>but how have we done this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How are we able to drink up the sea?</v>

194
00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:15.310
<v Speaker 2>Who gave us the sponge to wipe away the </v>
<v Speaker 2>entire horizon?</v>

195
00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:21.090
<v Speaker 2>What did we do when we unchained this </v>
<v Speaker 2>earth from its sun weather?</v>

196
00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:22.043
<v Speaker 2>Is it moving now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether are we moving now way from all </v>

197
00:13:25.781 --> 00:13:26.614
<v Speaker 2>sons?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are we not plunging continuously </v>

198
00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.630
<v Speaker 2>backwards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sideward,</v>

199
00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:36.900
<v Speaker 2>forward in all directions?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there any opera down left?</v>

200
00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:41.260
<v Speaker 2>Are we not straying as though through an</v>
<v Speaker 2>infinite nothing?</v>

201
00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:44.050
<v Speaker 2>Do we not feel the breath of empty </v>
<v Speaker 2>space?</v>

202
00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:45.243
<v Speaker 2>Has it not become colder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is not night and more night coming on </v>

203
00:13:49.421 --> 00:13:53.440
<v Speaker 2>all the while?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Must not lanterns be lit in the morning.</v>

204
00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:55.233
<v Speaker 2>Do we not hear anything yet of the noise</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the grave diggers who are burying </v>

205
00:13:58.031 --> 00:13:58.864
<v Speaker 2>God?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do we not smell anything yet of God's </v>

206
00:14:00.821 --> 00:14:04.900
<v Speaker 2>decomposition?</v>
<v Speaker 2>God's to decompose.</v>

207
00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.810
<v Speaker 2>God is dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God remains dead.</v>

208
00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:11.560
<v Speaker 2>We have killed him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How shall we?</v>

209
00:14:11.561 --> 00:14:15.190
<v Speaker 2>The murderer of all murderers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>comfort ourselves?</v>

210
00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:16.083
<v Speaker 2>What was holiest and most powerful of </v>
<v Speaker 2>all that the world has yet owned has </v>

211
00:14:19.331 --> 00:14:23.170
<v Speaker 2>bled to death under our knives who will </v>
<v Speaker 2>wipe this blood office?</v>

212
00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:26.290
<v Speaker 2>What water is there for us to clean </v>
<v Speaker 2>ourselves?</v>

213
00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:27.483
<v Speaker 2>What festivals of Atonement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what sacred game show we have to invent </v>

214
00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:33.970
<v Speaker 2>is not the greatness of this deed too </v>
<v Speaker 2>great for us,</v>

215
00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:37.720
<v Speaker 2>must we not ourselves become God simply </v>
<v Speaker 2>to seem worthy of it</v>

216
00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:45.573
<v Speaker 2>allows you can tell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a much different notion from the </v>

217
00:14:49.171 --> 00:14:54.070
<v Speaker 2>casual God is dead quotation that's most</v>
<v Speaker 2>generally associated with nature.</v>

218
00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:55.190
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is he saying?</v>

219
00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:56.900
<v Speaker 2>What he's saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something like this.</v>

220
00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:03.350
<v Speaker 2>A system like Christianity or any system</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's Qa,</v>

221
00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:07.460
<v Speaker 2>that's oriented,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this society for thousands and thousands</v>

222
00:15:07.461 --> 00:15:08.294
<v Speaker 2>of years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't simply be be eradicated by a </v>

223
00:15:11.331 --> 00:15:15.890
<v Speaker 2>casual gesture without consequences and </v>
<v Speaker 2>suing and its aftermath.</v>

224
00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:19.610
<v Speaker 2>What consequences will need?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She says,</v>

225
00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:22.550
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll no longer know up from down.</v>

226
00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:26.480
<v Speaker 2>What does he mean by that </v>
<v Speaker 2>metaphorically?</v>

227
00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:28.850
<v Speaker 2>Well App.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where you're headed,</v>

228
00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:31.790
<v Speaker 2>right and down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what you want to stay away from,</v>

229
00:15:31.791 --> 00:15:32.624
<v Speaker 2>and when you eradicate the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental presuppositions of your </v>

230
00:15:35.661 --> 00:15:36.980
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of values,</v>

231
00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:40.220
<v Speaker 2>then there is no up and there is no down</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then where are you?</v>

232
00:15:40.221 --> 00:15:41.870
<v Speaker 2>Precisely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

233
00:15:41.871 --> 00:15:42.704
<v Speaker 2>it's not so easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not so easy to say having not </v>

234
00:15:46.191 --> 00:15:47.900
<v Speaker 2>necessarily ever been in that position.</v>

235
00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:50.630
<v Speaker 2>What is your life like when you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know up from down?</v>

236
00:15:50.631 --> 00:15:51.464
<v Speaker 2>Is it merely neutral is merely no value </v>
<v Speaker 2>left or could it possibly be the case </v>

237
00:15:56.061 --> 00:15:58.640
<v Speaker 2>that if up and down and both being </v>
<v Speaker 2>eradicated,</v>

238
00:15:58.641 --> 00:15:59.474
<v Speaker 2>that the place that you're left and is </v>
<v Speaker 2>something much more akin to a permanent </v>

239
00:16:02.721 --> 00:16:07.721
<v Speaker 2>state of suffering because maybe it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>only the case that the constant capacity</v>

240
00:16:08.571 --> 00:16:09.404
<v Speaker 2>to drive for up in being enough that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe in the constant striving for up </v>

241
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:16.250
<v Speaker 2>is actually what makes your life </v>
<v Speaker 2>bearable to you,</v>

242
00:16:16.251 --> 00:16:18.230
<v Speaker 2>and if you lost the sense of up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>

243
00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:22.310
<v Speaker 2>the place that you would end up would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>not so much neutral as terrible.</v>

244
00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:25.160
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have any belief system at all,</v>

245
00:16:25.161 --> 00:16:25.994
<v Speaker 2>you do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's say you're an advocate of </v>

246
00:16:27.381 --> 00:16:28.214
<v Speaker 2>leftwing politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You take a pro environmental stance or </v>

247
00:16:30.951 --> 00:16:34.190
<v Speaker 2>an anti corporate stance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a relatively common thing to do</v>

248
00:16:34.191 --> 00:16:35.360
<v Speaker 2>and long undergraduates.</v>

249
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:38.450
<v Speaker 2>What do you do when you hold that belief</v>
<v Speaker 2>system?</v>

250
00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:43.880
<v Speaker 2>You view the world as it lays itself out</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you explained the manner in which it</v>

251
00:16:43.881 --> 00:16:47.510
<v Speaker 2>manifests itself in terms of the axioms </v>
<v Speaker 2>of that belief system,</v>

252
00:16:47.511 --> 00:16:50.240
<v Speaker 2>and you may know that you can do it </v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

253
00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:55.540
<v Speaker 2>you can tell a credible story about why </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world is the way it is by adopting,</v>

254
00:16:55.731 --> 00:16:56.564
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an anti corporate perspective because </v>

255
00:16:58.641 --> 00:16:59.474
<v Speaker 2>there are all sorts of terrible things </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the world that are a consequence </v>

256
00:17:02.211 --> 00:17:03.044
<v Speaker 2>say of corporate maneuvering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you might also say that and Piaget </v>

257
00:17:07.011 --> 00:17:07.844
<v Speaker 2>would say this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's a necessary developmental </v>

258
00:17:09.831 --> 00:17:14.600
<v Speaker 2>stage to acquire allegiance to a given </v>
<v Speaker 2>belief system.</v>

259
00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:16.280
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

260
00:17:16.281 --> 00:17:20.270
<v Speaker 2>any APP is better than none.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That might be the first observation,</v>

261
00:17:20.271 --> 00:17:21.104
<v Speaker 2>so even if your belief system is </v>
<v Speaker 2>relatively insufficient and easily </v>

262
00:17:23.961 --> 00:17:27.170
<v Speaker 2>challenged on intellectual grounds and </v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps not very complete anyways,</v>

263
00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:30.980
<v Speaker 2>the fact that it does lay out a moral </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure for you and tell you good from</v>

264
00:17:30.981 --> 00:17:33.410
<v Speaker 2>evil and right from wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a.</v>

265
00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:35.750
<v Speaker 2>that's a plus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an advantage.</v>

266
00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:40.130
<v Speaker 2>Now it's relative intellectual weakness </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's incoherence.</v>

267
00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:42.710
<v Speaker 2>Assuming it is incoherent to some </v>
<v Speaker 2>degree,</v>

268
00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:46.040
<v Speaker 2>that's a flaw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't mean that the effort to</v>

269
00:17:46.041 --> 00:17:48.470
<v Speaker 2>establish a system like that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>worthless.</v>

270
00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:49.453
<v Speaker 2>It's worthwhile and need just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say with regards to Christianity and </v>

271
00:17:52.201 --> 00:17:54.120
<v Speaker 2>Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

272
00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:57.510
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the errors,</v>

273
00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:58.463
<v Speaker 2>intellectual and moral of Institutional </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christianity are essentially beyond </v>

274
00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:03.263
<v Speaker 2>count,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's one thing you have to </v>

275
00:18:06.451 --> 00:18:09.060
<v Speaker 2>remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

276
00:18:09.061 --> 00:18:09.894
<v Speaker 2>in ordering of that sword is necessary </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the alternative which is always </v>

277
00:18:14.311 --> 00:18:17.100
<v Speaker 2>hidden from you in so far as you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>inside a moral system,</v>

278
00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:21.030
<v Speaker 2>the alternative as far worse chaos </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's worse.</v>

279
00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:30.273
<v Speaker 2>I mean part of the reason that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Germans preferred Hitler to chaos was </v>

280
00:18:35.021 --> 00:18:40.021
<v Speaker 2>because they felt that the order that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hitler promised repressive as it was was</v>

281
00:18:42.161 --> 00:18:45.700
<v Speaker 2>preferable to the chaos that was likely </v>
<v Speaker 2>to ensue in its absence.</v>

282
00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:48.970
<v Speaker 2>What is it about chaos that's so </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrifying?</v>

283
00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:58.670
<v Speaker 2>Second Nature said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>adopting a belief system of any sort and</v>

284
00:19:02.701 --> 00:19:03.534
<v Speaker 2>imposing coherency on the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>viewing it through the lens of that </v>

285
00:19:06.901 --> 00:19:10.620
<v Speaker 2>explicit system</v>
<v Speaker 2>disciplines your mind,</v>

286
00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:12.773
<v Speaker 2>so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to live in the absence of any stated </v>

287
00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:18.963
<v Speaker 2>beliefs is hardly to live at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To live in the presence of a narrow </v>

288
00:19:22.511 --> 00:19:26.980
<v Speaker 2>minded and extreme belief system is at </v>
<v Speaker 2>least to undergo the rigors,</v>

289
00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:32.020
<v Speaker 2>both behavioral and intellectual of </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming to terms with the world from some</v>

290
00:19:32.021 --> 00:19:32.920
<v Speaker 2>perspective.</v>

291
00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:40.940
<v Speaker 2>Nisha said the reason that the modern </v>
<v Speaker 2>mind such as it is,</v>

292
00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:44.720
<v Speaker 2>was able to free itself from the past at</v>
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>

293
00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:50.260
<v Speaker 2>was because it had first thoroughly </v>
<v Speaker 2>subjected itself to the tyranny that was</v>

294
00:19:50.871 --> 00:19:51.704
<v Speaker 2>imposed by the past in consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>disciplined itself developed enough </v>

295
00:19:56.151 --> 00:20:00.440
<v Speaker 2>discipline as a consequence of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>subordination to then break free of it.</v>

296
00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:07.753
<v Speaker 2>In all the science of morals so far,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one thing was lacking strange as it may </v>

297
00:20:10.191 --> 00:20:12.560
<v Speaker 2>sound,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem of morality itself.</v>

298
00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:15.860
<v Speaker 2>What was lacking was any suspicion that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there was something problematic here.</v>

299
00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:19.580
<v Speaker 2>Every society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every functioning individual,</v>

300
00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:24.470
<v Speaker 2>every functioning family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every social unit has a moral code,</v>

301
00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:29.180
<v Speaker 2>but they differ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what does that mean exactly?</v>

302
00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:30.530
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's complicated,</v>

303
00:20:30.531 --> 00:20:32.690
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the fact of the university,</v>

304
00:20:32.691 --> 00:20:33.524
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the code,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact of the code indicates that the </v>

305
00:20:37.251 --> 00:20:41.480
<v Speaker 2>code or code is necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the same token,</v>

306
00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:42.553
<v Speaker 2>the fact that there's a multiplicity of </v>
<v Speaker 2>codes seems to suggest that the </v>

307
00:20:45.741 --> 00:20:49.150
<v Speaker 2>particulars of a given aren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily relevant,</v>

308
00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:53.740
<v Speaker 2>and so niches says brilliantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're faced with a problem.</v>

309
00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:59.460
<v Speaker 2>No life without morality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no absolute morality.</v>

310
00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:01.373
<v Speaker 2>What do we do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are the things young observed was </v>

311
00:21:03.781 --> 00:21:05.970
<v Speaker 2>that if you look at the structure of </v>
<v Speaker 2>stories,</v>

312
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:06.833
<v Speaker 2>you thought first there is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship between stories and moral </v>

313
00:21:09.811 --> 00:21:11.070
<v Speaker 2>codes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

314
00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:12.990
<v Speaker 2>seems relatively straightforward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't it?</v>

315
00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:15.990
<v Speaker 2>If you tell a simple story like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>parable,</v>

316
00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:18.990
<v Speaker 2>sometimes they're complex to like an </v>
<v Speaker 2>aesop fable safe.</v>

317
00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:22.730
<v Speaker 2>What do you extract out from the story?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Moral?</v>

318
00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:23.633
<v Speaker 2>What's the moral?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the implication of the story for </v>

319
00:21:25.891 --> 00:21:26.910
<v Speaker 2>behavior?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

320
00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:28.583
<v Speaker 2>So you tell a little story about someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>who acts out of given moral code and </v>

321
00:21:31.561 --> 00:21:35.070
<v Speaker 2>that person does better or worse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the moral of the story is if you act</v>

322
00:21:35.071 --> 00:21:37.770
<v Speaker 2>in this manner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will do better or worse,</v>

323
00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:42.830
<v Speaker 2>proverbial knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all tell stories.</v>

324
00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:45.003
<v Speaker 2>They have identifiable structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can tell that because it's a movie </v>

325
00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:51.560
<v Speaker 2>studio in Hollywood can produce a movie </v>
<v Speaker 2>and people all over the world will watch</v>

326
00:21:51.561 --> 00:21:53.330
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People all over the world,</v>

327
00:21:53.570 --> 00:21:55.640
<v Speaker 2>all over the world tell stories to one </v>
<v Speaker 2>another.</v>

328
00:21:56.240 --> 00:22:00.290
<v Speaker 2>The plot elements seem similar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Morals,</v>

329
00:22:00.291 --> 00:22:04.410
<v Speaker 2>similar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a more difficult question,</v>

330
00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:08.370
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know that the details of morality can</v>

331
00:22:08.371 --> 00:22:13.371
<v Speaker 2>vary from culture to culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there anything that doesn't vary from</v>

332
00:22:13.411 --> 00:22:14.840
<v Speaker 2>culture to culture?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How?</v>

333
00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:16.350
<v Speaker 2>Why would you want to find that?</v>

334
00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:19.713
<v Speaker 2>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll xander knits and thought that one </v>

335
00:22:21.041 --> 00:22:25.030
<v Speaker 2>of the most important occurrences of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>20th century</v>

336
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.780
<v Speaker 2>or the Nuremberg trials,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Nuremberg trials,</v>

337
00:22:30.781 --> 00:22:31.614
<v Speaker 2>brought the perpetual perpetrators of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Nazi genocide to justice and it's </v>

338
00:22:37.621 --> 00:22:38.454
<v Speaker 2>easy to be cynical about that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps you shouldn't be cynical about </v>

339
00:22:40.831 --> 00:22:45.390
<v Speaker 2>it because the victors brought the </v>
<v Speaker 2>losers to trial,</v>

340
00:22:45.391 --> 00:22:46.224
<v Speaker 2>and so of course the losers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to be tried from the </v>

341
00:22:49.531 --> 00:22:53.250
<v Speaker 2>perspective of the winters moral code,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Solzhenitsyn says,</v>

342
00:22:53.251 --> 00:22:53.611
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

343
00:22:53.611 --> 00:22:56.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something more to this story.</v>

344
00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:57.953
<v Speaker 2>At least there seems to be in that many </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the events that characterized the </v>

345
00:23:04.231 --> 00:23:05.064
<v Speaker 2>Nazi atrocities were so awful outside of</v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual argumentation because you </v>

346
00:23:13.051 --> 00:23:15.270
<v Speaker 2>can provide an intellectual argument for</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

347
00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:20.660
<v Speaker 2>They were so awful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The proper visceral embodied response of</v>

348
00:23:21.631 --> 00:23:25.500
<v Speaker 2>any observer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>regardless of specific moral code,</v>

349
00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:28.020
<v Speaker 2>should be repugnant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>period,</v>

350
00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:33.120
<v Speaker 2>such that encoded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least initially in international law,</v>

351
00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:37.650
<v Speaker 2>genocide is a crime against humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

352
00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:42.980
<v Speaker 2>No matter what the particulars of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>moral code so goes the logic.</v>

353
00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:45.053
<v Speaker 2>You cannot construct a viable moral code</v>
<v Speaker 2>that enables genocide if not a logical </v>

354
00:23:51.581 --> 00:23:52.414
<v Speaker 2>impossibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And and I think it is a logical </v>

355
00:23:53.891 --> 00:23:56.410
<v Speaker 2>impossibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an ethical impossibility.</v>

356
00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:57.453
<v Speaker 2>And then you have to ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is not precisely an </v>

357
00:24:00.641 --> 00:24:04.240
<v Speaker 2>intellectual question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does that seem credible to you?</v>

358
00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:10.870
<v Speaker 2>Does it seem credible that there are </v>
<v Speaker 2>acts that are so terrible that no one,</v>

359
00:24:13.610 --> 00:24:16.880
<v Speaker 2>regardless of their stated position,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should ever engage in them,</v>

360
00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:20.720
<v Speaker 2>and if the answer is yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I would say,</v>

361
00:24:20.721 --> 00:24:21.554
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you haven't moved towards personal </v>

362
00:24:24.531 --> 00:24:29.210
<v Speaker 2>except of acceptance of an ultimate up </v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>

363
00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:33.950
<v Speaker 2>you've certainly identified at least one</v>
<v Speaker 2>down that you don't want to approach.</v>

364
00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:39.110
<v Speaker 2>And that's the beginnings of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>establishment of some notion of absolute</v>

365
00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:40.520
<v Speaker 2>moral authority.</v>

366
00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:48.060
<v Speaker 2>So what if we said hypothetically </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like this.</v>

367
00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:52.950
<v Speaker 2>Let's say that morality isn't a </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophy.</v>

368
00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:55.890
<v Speaker 2>It's not something explicit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something implicit.</v>

369
00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:57.960
<v Speaker 2>How does it evolve?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

370
00:24:58.500 --> 00:24:59.333
<v Speaker 2>emotional creatures produce it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to produce it in </v>

371
00:25:01.831 --> 00:25:04.230
<v Speaker 2>isolation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you were wearing a social animal,</v>

372
00:25:04.231 --> 00:25:07.470
<v Speaker 2>if you live a solitary and nocturnal </v>
<v Speaker 2>existence by yourself,</v>

373
00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:08.393
<v Speaker 2>there's no need for morality because you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have to regulate your behavior </v>

374
00:25:10.531 --> 00:25:13.670
<v Speaker 2>with regards to your peers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but your social animals,</v>

375
00:25:13.671 --> 00:25:17.880
<v Speaker 2>so you're stuck with everybody else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but everybody else could be conceived of</v>

376
00:25:17.881 --> 00:25:19.500
<v Speaker 2>as a grand average,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

377
00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:22.200
<v Speaker 2>How would you act towards the average </v>
<v Speaker 2>person?</v>

378
00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:24.300
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say that very,</v>

379
00:25:24.301 --> 00:25:28.530
<v Speaker 2>very stable moral systems tell you </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly that and they say things like a</v>

380
00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:33.840
<v Speaker 2>do unto others as you would have them do</v>
<v Speaker 2>unto you.</v>

381
00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:35.970
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basic principle of reciprocity.</v>

382
00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:39.800
<v Speaker 2>Why does that work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's a complex precept.</v>

383
00:25:39.801 --> 00:25:43.260
<v Speaker 2>It means I should treat you like I would</v>
<v Speaker 2>like to be treated by you,</v>

384
00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:44.581
<v Speaker 2>and you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

385
00:25:44.581 --> 00:25:45.414
<v Speaker 2>that means to be nice to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that isn't really what it means </v>

386
00:25:47.071 --> 00:25:48.660
<v Speaker 2>because nice isn't enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

387
00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:52.080
<v Speaker 2>What I want from you really is </v>
<v Speaker 2>communication,</v>

388
00:25:52.081 --> 00:25:52.914
<v Speaker 2>real communication feedback.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What am I doing that's acceptable and </v>

389
00:25:55.741 --> 00:25:56.574
<v Speaker 2>good?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What am I doing that's unacceptable and </v>

390
00:25:57.721 --> 00:25:58.554
<v Speaker 2>not good?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that latter aspect of feedback as </v>

391
00:26:02.941 --> 00:26:03.774
<v Speaker 2>part of the reason why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're a psychopathological and </v>

392
00:26:06.181 --> 00:26:07.014
<v Speaker 2>isolated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in much worse shape because half </v>

393
00:26:10.081 --> 00:26:12.990
<v Speaker 2>of your sanity or three quarters of it </v>
<v Speaker 2>or 90 percent of it,</v>

394
00:26:12.991 --> 00:26:13.824
<v Speaker 2>who knows is distributed sanity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to be that sane as long </v>

395
00:26:16.891 --> 00:26:17.724
<v Speaker 2>as you're hanging around other people </v>
<v Speaker 2>because as soon as you do something </v>

396
00:26:19.441 --> 00:26:20.274
<v Speaker 2>that's deviant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to raise an eyebrow at </v>

397
00:26:22.111 --> 00:26:22.740
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

398
00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:23.670
<v Speaker 2>And then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

399
00:26:23.671 --> 00:26:27.480
<v Speaker 2>well not that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as soon as you do something good,</v>

400
00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:29.610
<v Speaker 2>then they're going to pay more attention</v>
<v Speaker 2>to you and smile at you.</v>

401
00:26:29.611 --> 00:26:30.444
<v Speaker 2>So all of the information about how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>regulate yourself is out there in the </v>

402
00:26:34.591 --> 00:26:35.430
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

403
00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:36.383
<v Speaker 2>The average person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many people do you interact with in </v>

404
00:26:38.581 --> 00:26:40.280
<v Speaker 2>a week?</v>
<v Speaker 2>300.</v>

405
00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:42.060
<v Speaker 2>Say maybe it's not that many.</v>
<v Speaker 2>100.</v>

406
00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:45.810
<v Speaker 2>How about year thousand?</v>
<v Speaker 2>2,000.</v>

407
00:26:45.811 --> 00:26:48.050
<v Speaker 2>Five thousand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10,000.</v>

408
00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:51.720
<v Speaker 2>What do they all telling you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

409
00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:54.260
<v Speaker 2>the message is similar across people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How similar.</v>

410
00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:58.540
<v Speaker 2>Don't know exactly how similar that </v>
<v Speaker 2>would stories tell you.</v>
