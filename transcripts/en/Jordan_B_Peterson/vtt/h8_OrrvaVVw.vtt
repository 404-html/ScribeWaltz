00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.210
<v Speaker 1>Hello there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr Ruben [inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:03.253
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jp January one we got anything good for </v>

3
00:00:06.201 --> 00:00:07.034
<v Speaker 2>the people?</v>

4
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.240
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how good it is.</v>

5
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.480
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess we're going to find out how good</v>

6
00:00:12.481 --> 00:00:15.030
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not something I'm thrilled about by</v>

7
00:00:15.031 --> 00:00:15.864
<v Speaker 1>any stretch of the imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you and I have been talking for a </v>

8
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.333
<v Speaker 1>couple of weeks now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never since this scandal around Carl </v>

9
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.080
<v Speaker 1>Benjamin or Sargon of the cod broken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We decided,</v>

10
00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.550
<v Speaker 1>well a while back that we were going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>while do a variety of things,</v>

11
00:00:32.551 --> 00:00:33.384
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were going to announce our departure </v>

12
00:00:35.731 --> 00:00:38.820
<v Speaker 1>from Patrion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what we're doing in this video.</v>

13
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to leave Patriot on January </v>
<v Speaker 1>15th</v>

14
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.860
<v Speaker 2>I also am going to leave Patriot on </v>
<v Speaker 2>January 15th which by the way,</v>

15
00:00:47.861 --> 00:00:48.694
<v Speaker 2>we should just be clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not something that we wanted to </v>

16
00:00:51.641 --> 00:00:52.474
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were both perfectly happy on </v>

17
00:00:54.011 --> 00:00:55.840
<v Speaker 2>patriotic patriotic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least for me,</v>

18
00:00:55.841 --> 00:00:59.340
<v Speaker 2>it's been the backbone of my show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's,</v>

19
00:00:59.341 --> 00:01:03.490
<v Speaker 2>it's somewhere between 60 and 70% of our</v>
<v Speaker 2>funding is through patriots.</v>

20
00:01:03.491 --> 00:01:05.290
<v Speaker 2>So this is not something we wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

21
00:01:05.291 --> 00:01:08.580
<v Speaker 2>I know we're going to talk about a whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of things in this reporting.</v>

22
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:09.643
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that New York Times article that </v>

23
00:01:10.691 --> 00:01:12.550
<v Speaker 2>came out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the implication was,</v>

24
00:01:12.551 --> 00:01:13.960
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're doing this for money.</v>

25
00:01:13.961 --> 00:01:14.794
<v Speaker 2>It's like we're taking a major hit right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now and opening ourselves up to all </v>

26
00:01:18.191 --> 00:01:19.024
<v Speaker 2>sorts of risks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going ahead and doing that </v>

27
00:01:20.731 --> 00:01:23.460
<v Speaker 2>because I believe we can do something </v>
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

28
00:01:23.461 --> 00:01:24.294
<v Speaker 2>We've got to figure out exactly what </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is and that's what we're working </v>

29
00:01:26.311 --> 00:01:26.990
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

30
00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.670
<v Speaker 1>So we can say two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

31
00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:29.943
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd also like to thank the Patriot on </v>

32
00:01:31.461 --> 00:01:32.294
<v Speaker 1>people for what they did in the past </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they provided me with a </v>

33
00:01:35.211 --> 00:01:37.670
<v Speaker 1>tremendous amount of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the ability,</v>

34
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.720
<v Speaker 1>the opportunity to generate a tremendous</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of financial support at a time.</v>

35
00:01:41.721 --> 00:01:42.554
<v Speaker 1>I really needed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm not happy in the least with </v>

36
00:01:44.871 --> 00:01:45.704
<v Speaker 1>what has happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have thought about it a lot and </v>

37
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.313
<v Speaker 1>believe that given patrons proclivity to</v>
<v Speaker 1>sensor and the reasons that they're </v>

38
00:01:52.821 --> 00:01:53.654
<v Speaker 1>doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially as I've looked more and more </v>

39
00:01:54.591 --> 00:01:57.020
<v Speaker 1>deeply into the reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

40
00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:58.603
<v Speaker 1>particularly with regards to my </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovery of the website changed the </v>

41
00:02:02.451 --> 00:02:03.284
<v Speaker 1>terms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've become increasingly convinced that </v>

42
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.570
<v Speaker 1>it's unethical to continue my </v>
<v Speaker 1>association with the company.</v>

43
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:12.583
<v Speaker 1>And I also agree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jack Conte said in that New York Times </v>

44
00:02:14.391 --> 00:02:15.224
<v Speaker 1>article trying to justify,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say Sam Harris his departure and are </v>

45
00:02:17.961 --> 00:02:18.794
<v Speaker 1>threatened departure that it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivated primarily by financial gain </v>

46
00:02:22.701 --> 00:02:23.900
<v Speaker 1>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

47
00:02:23.901 --> 00:02:26.570
<v Speaker 1>I've got nothing against financial gain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

48
00:02:26.571 --> 00:02:31.070
<v Speaker 1>I've said that from the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if if things that I'm doing generate</v>

49
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.170
<v Speaker 1>an honest amount of money that I can put</v>
<v Speaker 1>two reasonable use,</v>

50
00:02:36.171 --> 00:02:38.570
<v Speaker 1>then so much the better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

51
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.473
<v Speaker 1>this is a major financial blow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm using the Patriot on money for a </v>

52
00:02:43.971 --> 00:02:44.804
<v Speaker 1>variety of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most particularly to support this </v>

53
00:02:46.731 --> 00:02:49.010
<v Speaker 1>educational endeavor that I've talked to</v>
<v Speaker 1>people about.</v>

54
00:02:49.011 --> 00:02:51.440
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our attempt to build an online education</v>

55
00:02:51.441 --> 00:02:53.780
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so like it's a major hit.</v>

56
00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.781
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course,</v>

57
00:02:54.781 --> 00:02:55.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to be clear,</v>

58
00:02:55.651 --> 00:02:57.600
<v Speaker 2>it's like when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we're doing my show,</v>

59
00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't have to tell everybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>about Youtube d monetization,</v>

60
00:03:00.731 --> 00:03:01.564
<v Speaker 2>but for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my show a week or two ago with the mom </v>

61
00:03:03.341 --> 00:03:04.174
<v Speaker 2>to Iti was demonetized by the algorithm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then demonetized further after manual </v>

62
00:03:08.891 --> 00:03:11.160
<v Speaker 2>review by a human,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's patriotic,</v>

63
00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.550
<v Speaker 2>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the supporters,</v>

64
00:03:12.551 --> 00:03:13.384
<v Speaker 2>the individual people that allow us to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go ahead and do more of these </v>

65
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.170
<v Speaker 2>controversial so to speak episode.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

66
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.033
<v Speaker 2>just nothing that we're doing right now </v>
<v Speaker 2>is against the people that have </v>

67
00:03:23.261 --> 00:03:25.380
<v Speaker 2>supported us or our patrons or anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

68
00:03:25.381 --> 00:03:26.214
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is about making a stand against </v>

69
00:03:28.061 --> 00:03:28.894
<v Speaker 2>this ever moving encroachments on free </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech and free expression and the rest </v>

70
00:03:32.291 --> 00:03:33.124
<v Speaker 2>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's like this is one that we just </v>

71
00:03:34.151 --> 00:03:36.340
<v Speaker 2>feel is the right one to make the move </v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

72
00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.020
<v Speaker 1>The reason that we jointly decided on </v>
<v Speaker 1>January 15th well,</v>

73
00:03:40.021 --> 00:03:40.854
<v Speaker 1>there was a couple of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first was we thought that we might </v>

74
00:03:43.891 --> 00:03:44.724
<v Speaker 1>have something approximating an </v>
<v Speaker 1>alternative potentially available for </v>

75
00:03:48.001 --> 00:03:48.834
<v Speaker 1>preliminary launch at that date.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although we've decided to delay that </v>

76
00:03:51.661 --> 00:03:54.840
<v Speaker 1>because the user interface needs work </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's the other thing,</v>

77
00:03:54.841 --> 00:03:55.674
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that their needs perhaps to be a </v>

78
00:03:56.941 --> 00:03:59.460
<v Speaker 1>replacement for patron,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's a possibility,</v>

79
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:00.693
<v Speaker 1>like it's not obvious to me that </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporations can run platforms for </v>

80
00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:06.693
<v Speaker 1>untrammeled communication successfully </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the net in today's climate and that </v>

81
00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.610
<v Speaker 1>food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything I might design,</v>

82
00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:14.600
<v Speaker 2>let's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's not gloss over that.</v>

83
00:04:14.601 --> 00:04:15.434
<v Speaker 2>I mean it might be possible that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Patriot method is not what's needed </v>

84
00:04:18.741 --> 00:04:19.574
<v Speaker 2>exactly for the future of the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is what we're trying to </v>

85
00:04:21.741 --> 00:04:25.190
<v Speaker 2>figure out right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why we've got every engineer,</v>

86
00:04:25.191 --> 00:04:26.024
<v Speaker 2>I mean people from Google and facebook </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Yahoo and everybody reaching out to </v>

87
00:04:28.341 --> 00:04:32.270
<v Speaker 2>us because it's like everyone's trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to solve this problem and it's still,</v>

88
00:04:32.271 --> 00:04:33.104
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things we've been talking </v>

89
00:04:33.831 --> 00:04:36.260
<v Speaker 2>about now for the last while,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really for the last year,</v>

90
00:04:36.261 --> 00:04:37.094
<v Speaker 2>but intensely in the last month is what </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually is the problem itself because </v>

91
00:04:42.951 --> 00:04:45.440
<v Speaker 2>until we really figure out what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem is.</v>

92
00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:46.633
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

93
00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:47.563
<v Speaker 1>I think the problem is</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to regulate an incredibly diverse </v>

94
00:04:51.891 --> 00:04:52.724
<v Speaker 1>range of opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If such regulation needs to be </v>

95
00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.520
<v Speaker 1>instantiated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could take a limit case,</v>

96
00:04:58.521 --> 00:04:59.354
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the desire of companies like facebook </v>

97
00:05:01.941 --> 00:05:05.210
<v Speaker 1>not to have their platforms used for </v>
<v Speaker 1>recruitment for Isis.</v>

98
00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:09.290
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to make a case that that's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>a reasonable restriction.</v>

99
00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:10.473
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then,</v>

100
00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:11.503
<v Speaker 1>but then the next issue is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you could make an exception </v>

101
00:05:16.341 --> 00:05:17.174
<v Speaker 1>there because maybe you consider that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>wartime exception or something like </v>

102
00:05:20.781 --> 00:05:21.614
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then the fundamental problem to me </v>

103
00:05:24.201 --> 00:05:27.290
<v Speaker 1>seems to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll return again to that change the</v>

104
00:05:27.291 --> 00:05:28.124
<v Speaker 1>terms website that a whole variety of </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies and organizations spearheaded </v>

105
00:05:33.861 --> 00:05:36.650
<v Speaker 1>in not least by the southern poverty law</v>
<v Speaker 1>center,</v>

106
00:05:36.651 --> 00:05:37.484
<v Speaker 1>that hateful organization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the worst that has decided that they're </v>

107
00:05:42.981 --> 00:05:47.180
<v Speaker 1>going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>compel encourage.</v>

108
00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.460
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what</v>

109
00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.933
<v Speaker 1>if fame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps companies that don't band </v>

110
00:05:56.221 --> 00:05:58.880
<v Speaker 1>together to what they see as hate </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech.</v>

111
00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is where,</v>

112
00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:02.080
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is where the moving line is.</v>

113
00:06:02.081 --> 00:06:05.290
<v Speaker 2>The key part of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you can always find the free,</v>

114
00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:10.150
<v Speaker 2>the most fringe cases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can always find isis on one side and</v>

115
00:06:10.151 --> 00:06:10.984
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most fringe KKK white supremacist </v>

116
00:06:13.241 --> 00:06:15.670
<v Speaker 2>group or whatever you want to call it on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other side.</v>

117
00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:16.923
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's not forget southern poverty law </v>

118
00:06:17.561 --> 00:06:19.060
<v Speaker 2>center.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've written things about you.</v>

119
00:06:19.061 --> 00:06:19.894
<v Speaker 2>They've written things about me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I on Hirsi Ali and my gender wise and </v>

120
00:06:22.751 --> 00:06:27.751
<v Speaker 2>Sam Harris and a litany of Majid sued </v>
<v Speaker 2>them to,</v>

121
00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.420
<v Speaker 2>to and actually want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there,</v>

122
00:06:30.421 --> 00:06:31.254
<v Speaker 2>there is a push back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is just another level of the </v>

123
00:06:33.221 --> 00:06:34.054
<v Speaker 2>stand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like they cannot be trusted to be </v>

124
00:06:36.221 --> 00:06:40.420
<v Speaker 2>on the boards of any of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>organizations that are deciding,</v>

125
00:06:40.421 --> 00:06:40.540
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

126
00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:42.910
<v Speaker 1>What terms of services should have </v>
<v Speaker 1>access.</v>

127
00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:48.090
<v Speaker 1>It's really who should have access to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Internet isn't just about worse.</v>

128
00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:49.443
<v Speaker 1>It's worse than outdated because when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they start to pressure the credit card </v>

129
00:06:52.391 --> 00:06:53.224
<v Speaker 1>companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I would consider this a warning to </v>

130
00:06:54.761 --> 00:06:56.020
<v Speaker 1>everyone who's listening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

131
00:06:56.021 --> 00:06:57.760
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's think this through.</v>

132
00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.193
<v Speaker 1>So the New York Times last week wrote an</v>
<v Speaker 1>article about the credit cards </v>

133
00:07:01.841 --> 00:07:02.674
<v Speaker 1>complicity in loaning money to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible tiny minority of people who </v>

134
00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:07.053
<v Speaker 1>engaged in mass shootings stating that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the responsibility of the credit </v>

135
00:07:11.261 --> 00:07:14.560
<v Speaker 1>card companies to monitor and </v>
<v Speaker 1>potentially prevent that activity.</v>

136
00:07:14.561 --> 00:07:15.350
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

137
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:17.080
<v Speaker 1>so what's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the idea here?</v>

138
00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:18.423
<v Speaker 1>The idea is that the companies to whom </v>
<v Speaker 1>we have in trusted our monetary system </v>

139
00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:24.933
<v Speaker 1>in large parts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be the credit card companies </v>

140
00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:27.393
<v Speaker 1>now get to review our spending patterns </v>
<v Speaker 1>to determine if what we purchased is in </v>

141
00:07:31.661 --> 00:07:32.494
<v Speaker 1>accordance with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with what they regard as morally </v>

142
00:07:34.001 --> 00:07:35.500
<v Speaker 1>acceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

143
00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:38.910
<v Speaker 1>And we think that's a good idea that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where we're headed.</v>

144
00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:39.893
<v Speaker 1>And Mastercard and visa and paypal are </v>
<v Speaker 1>already starting to block people like </v>

145
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:44.203
<v Speaker 1>they brought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mastercard was instrumental in blocking </v>

146
00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:47.183
<v Speaker 1>Spencer,</v>

147
00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:48.650
<v Speaker 2>Robert Spencer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

148
00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:51.180
<v Speaker 2>It's Robert Spencer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not retreats fancier.</v>

149
00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.860
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the best selling author and the guy</v>

150
00:07:53.861 --> 00:07:58.861
<v Speaker 1>who runs Jihad watch mastercard required</v>
<v Speaker 1>patron two d plot form him.</v>

151
00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:01.440
<v Speaker 2>And just to be very clear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they sent out a tweet,</v>

152
00:08:01.441 --> 00:08:04.050
<v Speaker 2>which everyone can find.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm shocked that they haven't deleted it</v>

153
00:08:04.051 --> 00:08:07.290
<v Speaker 2>yet where they said that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they use this word,</v>

154
00:08:07.291 --> 00:08:08.850
<v Speaker 2>which I think is the key to the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

155
00:08:08.851 --> 00:08:09.684
<v Speaker 2>They said that they unfortunately had to</v>
<v Speaker 2>delete his patrion because of </v>

156
00:08:14.341 --> 00:08:17.100
<v Speaker 2>mastercard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what are they actually saying?</v>

157
00:08:17.101 --> 00:08:20.460
<v Speaker 2>There are these patriot and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh we didn't want to delete your page,</v>

158
00:08:20.461 --> 00:08:25.461
<v Speaker 2>but mastercard forced our hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that is some deeply scary.</v>

159
00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:26.693
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then we have to talk about hate </v>

160
00:08:27.871 --> 00:08:30.780
<v Speaker 1>speech because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the whole concept of,</v>

161
00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:33.010
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously there is a,</v>

162
00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:36.060
<v Speaker 1>people can be very nasty when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate,</v>

163
00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:38.303
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that there's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>identifiable category and you can put </v>

164
00:08:44.251 --> 00:08:45.084
<v Speaker 1>boundaries around it and turn it hate </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech and then you can produce </v>

165
00:08:47.521 --> 00:08:48.354
<v Speaker 1>committees or deal with people on a one </v>
<v Speaker 1>to one basis as patron is doing without </v>

166
00:08:53.161 --> 00:08:57.540
<v Speaker 1>any central policy or let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite their central policy or that you</v>

167
00:08:57.541 --> 00:08:58.374
<v Speaker 1>could turn that into an algorithm that </v>
<v Speaker 1>could validly identify hate speech </v>

168
00:09:01.921 --> 00:09:03.990
<v Speaker 1>without producing false positives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

169
00:09:03.991 --> 00:09:04.824
<v Speaker 1>Without accusing people who shouldn't be</v>
<v Speaker 1>accused of violating all of that's just </v>

170
00:09:08.131 --> 00:09:11.220
<v Speaker 1>completely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just beggars the imagination as far</v>

171
00:09:11.221 --> 00:09:12.054
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

172
00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:14.540
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're also just opening a Pandora's</v>

173
00:09:14.541 --> 00:09:16.700
<v Speaker 2>box from hell because just in the last </v>
<v Speaker 2>couple of days,</v>

174
00:09:16.701 --> 00:09:17.534
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you saw this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the women's march in California </v>

175
00:09:19.251 --> 00:09:22.460
<v Speaker 2>canceled their rally because they felt </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it was too white.</v>

176
00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:25.280
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now imagine if they canceled their rally</v>

177
00:09:25.281 --> 00:09:27.560
<v Speaker 2>because it was too black or too anything</v>
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

178
00:09:27.561 --> 00:09:29.600
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so does that count as,</v>

179
00:09:29.601 --> 00:09:30.434
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you guys now being racist against </v>

180
00:09:31.551 --> 00:09:34.810
<v Speaker 2>white people and now we know that that </v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't be a problem for these guys.</v>

181
00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:39.910
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I can't fathom in</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense is the lack of imagination on</v>

182
00:09:40.281 --> 00:09:41.114
<v Speaker 1>the part of the people who are engaging </v>
<v Speaker 1>in censorship of what they regard as </v>

183
00:09:44.931 --> 00:09:48.260
<v Speaker 1>hate speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's an old military adage which</v>

184
00:09:48.261 --> 00:09:52.280
<v Speaker 1>is that if you invent a weapon it will </v>
<v Speaker 1>be used by your enemy within 15 years.</v>

185
00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:53.840
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so why?</v>

186
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:54.833
<v Speaker 1>What makes the people on the on the left</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're the ones who are doing </v>

187
00:09:58.401 --> 00:10:03.401
<v Speaker 1>this as you can clearly see in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>change the terms website,</v>

188
00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:05.293
<v Speaker 1>what makes them so sure that exactly the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same tactics won't be used against them </v>

189
00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:13.670
<v Speaker 1>like at the drop of a hat once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once the tactics have been validated and</v>

190
00:10:13.671 --> 00:10:14.504
<v Speaker 1>put in place.</v>

191
00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:15.583
<v Speaker 2>I think it's either,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's either just very shortsightedness </v>

192
00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:18.403
<v Speaker 2>on their hand or they think that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>can actually stamp out enough hate </v>

193
00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:24.740
<v Speaker 2>within that very small window before it </v>
<v Speaker 2>would turn on them.</v>

194
00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:26.750
<v Speaker 2>Or they just don't think these things </v>
<v Speaker 2>fully through</v>

195
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:27.943
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or there's another just another </v>

196
00:10:29.081 --> 00:10:29.914
<v Speaker 1>possibility too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that there are so opposed to </v>

197
00:10:32.411 --> 00:10:33.244
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental structures of the West </v>
<v Speaker 1>that let's say and regard them as so </v>

198
00:10:37.671 --> 00:10:38.504
<v Speaker 1>patriarchal and oppressive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they'd be willing to take the risk </v>

199
00:10:40.691 --> 00:10:41.524
<v Speaker 1>of sacrificing their own free speech </v>
<v Speaker 1>just to have there what have their </v>

200
00:10:45.641 --> 00:10:48.040
<v Speaker 1>destructive way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

201
00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:52.460
<v Speaker 2>We should also acknowledge that in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>New York Times piece that was written,</v>

202
00:10:52.461 --> 00:10:54.720
<v Speaker 2>which was written by Nellie Bowles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who wrote the,</v>

203
00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:57.830
<v Speaker 2>the now infamous piece about you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Enforcement Origami,</v>

204
00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:00.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the quote that Jacqueline Hart,</v>

205
00:11:00.951 --> 00:11:03.980
<v Speaker 2>who is the head of trust and safety over</v>
<v Speaker 2>a patriot.</v>

206
00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:05.813
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no hidden who has no grounding </v>

207
00:11:06.751 --> 00:11:11.610
<v Speaker 1>in philosophy or any of the background </v>
<v Speaker 1>training that might be necessary to even</v>

208
00:11:11.611 --> 00:11:14.670
<v Speaker 1>remotely begin to participate properly </v>
<v Speaker 1>in such a thing.</v>

209
00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:15.591
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course not.</v>

210
00:11:15.591 --> 00:11:18.180
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the quote that she gave Nellie in the</v>

211
00:11:18.181 --> 00:11:22.290
<v Speaker 2>article said that you can't say these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm loosely quoting this now.</v>

212
00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:25.110
<v Speaker 2>You can't say these words on our </v>
<v Speaker 2>platform,</v>

213
00:11:25.111 --> 00:11:25.944
<v Speaker 2>referring to Carl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>referring to him saying the n word in </v>

214
00:11:28.051 --> 00:11:29.480
<v Speaker 2>that video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we,</v>

215
00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:31.620
<v Speaker 2>which we know they were using out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>context and all that,</v>

216
00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:35.100
<v Speaker 2>but he never set it on their platform.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He never said it on patriotic.</v>

217
00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:36.990
<v Speaker 2>He didn't even say it on his own </v>
<v Speaker 2>channel.</v>

218
00:11:36.991 --> 00:11:38.250
<v Speaker 2>That was you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

219
00:11:38.251 --> 00:11:40.740
<v Speaker 2>using Patrion for the funding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there was a,</v>

220
00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:45.960
<v Speaker 2>it's almost the entire story was built </v>
<v Speaker 2>on quicksand that tried to put out there</v>

221
00:11:45.961 --> 00:11:46.681
<v Speaker 2>on the New York Times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

222
00:11:46.681 --> 00:11:47.514
<v Speaker 2>of course myself and many other people </v>
<v Speaker 2>tweet the hell out of it and gets </v>

223
00:11:51.031 --> 00:11:51.864
<v Speaker 2>hundreds and thousands probably of </v>
<v Speaker 2>retweets and comments to Nellie and she </v>

224
00:11:55.421 --> 00:11:56.254
<v Speaker 2>doesn't respond.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nor does the New York Times issue any </v>

225
00:11:58.001 --> 00:12:03.001
<v Speaker 2>sort of correction about the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental piece of the story was alive</v>

226
00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:06.370
<v Speaker 2>and they don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have a problem doing that.</v>

227
00:12:06.371 --> 00:12:09.850
<v Speaker 2>So that's why this is so layered about </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech and finance</v>

228
00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:10.913
<v Speaker 1>and journalists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazing to see journalists take the </v>

229
00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:16.043
<v Speaker 1>journey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that happened in </v>

230
00:12:16.891 --> 00:12:19.380
<v Speaker 1>Canada to me was that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

231
00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:21.383
<v Speaker 1>after I made the initial videos that </v>
<v Speaker 1>caused such a political furor was that </v>

232
00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.860
<v Speaker 1>once the main journalists in Canada sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of figured out what I was doing,</v>

233
00:12:28.861 --> 00:12:32.190
<v Speaker 1>they all came out in my support.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the post media group,</v>

234
00:12:32.191 --> 00:12:33.024
<v Speaker 1>which is 200 newspapers all came out to </v>
<v Speaker 1>support what I was doing because they </v>

235
00:12:35.971 --> 00:12:37.500
<v Speaker 1>realize that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

236
00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:41.040
<v Speaker 1>they're journalists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apart from Comedians,</v>

237
00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:41.903
<v Speaker 1>there isn't anybody who relies more on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the principle of free speech to justify </v>

238
00:12:46.261 --> 00:12:50.370
<v Speaker 1>and allow their occupation even to exist</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the New York Times.</v>

239
00:12:50.371 --> 00:12:54.020
<v Speaker 1>Not Too understand that this threat is </v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

240
00:12:54.021 --> 00:12:54.854
<v Speaker 1>also a threat to everything upon which </v>
<v Speaker 1>their entire organization has been </v>

241
00:12:58.341 --> 00:12:59.174
<v Speaker 1>predicated is also an indication of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>same kind of willful blindness that </v>

242
00:13:02.871 --> 00:13:05.600
<v Speaker 1>we've already been discussing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But having said that,</v>

243
00:13:05.601 --> 00:13:09.400
<v Speaker 1>I would still like to say I think the </v>
<v Speaker 1>biggest danger here I really,</v>

244
00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:14.440
<v Speaker 1>and it's just made my jaw drop over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>last couple of weeks thinking about it,</v>

245
00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:15.303
<v Speaker 1>is the fact that the credit card </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies are now taking it upon </v>

246
00:13:18.101 --> 00:13:22.090
<v Speaker 1>themselves to potentially police the </v>
<v Speaker 1>activities of their users.</v>

247
00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:24.640
<v Speaker 1>It's like my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that really,</v>

248
00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:27.010
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just can't believe that</v>

249
00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:29.913
<v Speaker 1>any sensible person would think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>through and then want to live in a </v>

250
00:13:32.891 --> 00:13:33.724
<v Speaker 1>society where your spending habits are </v>
<v Speaker 1>being monitored by the company that </v>

251
00:13:38.321 --> 00:13:40.840
<v Speaker 1>basically produces your money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

252
00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:43.570
<v Speaker 1>think of anything more totalitarian than</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

253
00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:46.440
<v Speaker 2>Toso loosely quote our friend Eric </v>
<v Speaker 2>Weinstein.</v>

254
00:13:46.441 --> 00:13:49.140
<v Speaker 2>Should Republicans be allowed to use </v>
<v Speaker 2>roads that,</v>

255
00:13:49.141 --> 00:13:49.974
<v Speaker 2>that sort of where we're headed here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that every public good will be </v>

256
00:13:54.121 --> 00:13:57.090
<v Speaker 2>eventually decided,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you access to it?</v>

257
00:13:57.091 --> 00:13:58.530
<v Speaker 2>Will you have access to water?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It should,</v>

258
00:13:58.531 --> 00:13:59.061
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should,</v>

259
00:13:59.061 --> 00:13:59.894
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an avowed white supremacist right now </v>

260
00:14:01.561 --> 00:14:04.650
<v Speaker 2>that is potentially watching this or </v>
<v Speaker 2>lives in America somewhere.</v>

261
00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:06.350
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the 50 of the,</v>

262
00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:08.933
<v Speaker 2>one of the 42 of them should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should they have access to water at </v>

263
00:14:12.211 --> 00:14:13.044
<v Speaker 2>their home?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Should they allow to be able to get </v>

264
00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:17.820
<v Speaker 2>electricity at their home or phone lines</v>
<v Speaker 2>or all of these things?</v>

265
00:14:17.821 --> 00:14:20.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is where we're headed.</v>

266
00:14:20.161 --> 00:14:24.540
<v Speaker 2>Especially when you ever expand the </v>
<v Speaker 2>definition of who that person is.</v>

267
00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:26.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They won't in China.</v>

268
00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:28.150
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

269
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:29.170
<v Speaker 2>that's where they're going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

270
00:14:29.171 --> 00:14:30.280
<v Speaker 2>So is that the test case?</v>

271
00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:32.470
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>

272
00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:33.753
<v Speaker 1>it's an indication that the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Chinese have been tempted into this </v>

273
00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:37.893
<v Speaker 1>is also an indication of the temptation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's intrinsic in the technological </v>

274
00:14:40.871 --> 00:14:43.590
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The credit card companies are in a weird</v>

275
00:14:43.591 --> 00:14:47.760
<v Speaker 1>situation as far as I'm concerned </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the only reason they work at all</v>

276
00:14:47.761 --> 00:14:51.300
<v Speaker 1>is because people actually trust them </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely.</v>

277
00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:53.240
<v Speaker 1>I just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

278
00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:57.570
<v Speaker 1>you're just a proxy for money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're a proxy for cash.</v>

279
00:14:57.571 --> 00:14:58.404
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's basically how the mastercard </v>

280
00:14:59.911 --> 00:15:01.350
<v Speaker 1>advertises itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

281
00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:02.603
<v Speaker 1>So you're a proxy for cash and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government doesn't watch what you spend </v>

282
00:15:05.431 --> 00:15:10.010
<v Speaker 1>your money on except an extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily limited cases.</v>

283
00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are money laundering laws </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so forth,</v>

284
00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:15.230
<v Speaker 1>but that's a direct violation of a law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

285
00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:16.103
<v Speaker 1>That's part of tracking down criminal </v>
<v Speaker 1>activity that it has nothing to do so </v>

286
00:15:18.901 --> 00:15:19.734
<v Speaker 1>far with with hate speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which by the way is protected by the </v>

287
00:15:23.521 --> 00:15:24.354
<v Speaker 1>first amendment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So or which means in some sense that it </v>

288
00:15:27.271 --> 00:15:28.560
<v Speaker 1>doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

289
00:15:28.561 --> 00:15:29.550
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a legal,</v>

290
00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:32.600
<v Speaker 1>as a legal</v>
<v Speaker 1>concept.</v>

291
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:34.470
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is my Canada,</v>

292
00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:35.713
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we shouldn't gloss over that fact too </v>

293
00:15:36.991 --> 00:15:37.824
<v Speaker 2>because you know you are and we just did</v>
<v Speaker 2>however many countries in Europe and </v>

294
00:15:40.861 --> 00:15:41.694
<v Speaker 2>we're going to go back this spring and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like everybody that we met was </v>

295
00:15:45.721 --> 00:15:50.721
<v Speaker 2>jealous of the freedoms that we have in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the United States relative to speech.</v>

296
00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:51.983
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And everybody that would come up to us </v>

297
00:15:53.251 --> 00:15:54.420
<v Speaker 2>after the show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>holy cow,</v>

298
00:15:54.421 --> 00:15:55.254
<v Speaker 2>I wish we could say that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish we didn't worry about this or </v>

299
00:15:57.031 --> 00:15:57.864
<v Speaker 2>that or jokes or the rest of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we did that video in Oslo where you </v>

300
00:16:00.601 --> 00:16:03.360
<v Speaker 2>talked about Danky Ila and it's like </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

301
00:16:03.361 --> 00:16:04.194
<v Speaker 2>they're jealous of our freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we should be very clear here that </v>

302
00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:07.793
<v Speaker 2>though you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we now have a payment processor </v>

303
00:16:10.831 --> 00:16:11.664
<v Speaker 2>issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is an indirect connection to </v>

304
00:16:14.731 --> 00:16:17.250
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is that we're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>build out here.</v>

305
00:16:17.251 --> 00:16:18.940
<v Speaker 2>And we're still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a little a morphous</v>

306
00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:19.963
<v Speaker 1>at the moment</v>

307
00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:23.290
<v Speaker 2>is that it's changing because a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are saying,</v>

308
00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:25.240
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys really want to solve this.</v>

309
00:16:25.241 --> 00:16:29.710
<v Speaker 2>Then you have to go full crypto.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The video has to be hosted.</v>

310
00:16:29.711 --> 00:16:30.540
<v Speaker 2>Crypto.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

311
00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:34.290
<v Speaker 2>The finances have to be hosted or have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be done via crypto.</v>

312
00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:35.800
<v Speaker 2>All of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are,</v>

313
00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:38.890
<v Speaker 2>these are major,</v>
<v Speaker 2>major things that we're trying to figure</v>

314
00:16:38.891 --> 00:16:39.724
<v Speaker 2>out on every front.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Certain payment processors are a little </v>

315
00:16:41.711 --> 00:16:43.870
<v Speaker 2>more willing to stand up to the mob than</v>
<v Speaker 2>others.</v>

316
00:16:43.871 --> 00:16:47.080
<v Speaker 2>So we're talking to different people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we'll really going on everything</v>

317
00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:48.301
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

318
00:16:48.301 --> 00:16:51.870
<v Speaker 1>the tentative platform that we're trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to build and to build carefully,</v>

319
00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:53.423
<v Speaker 1>we'll provide the possibility of </v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple payment portals in the hope </v>

320
00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:02.660
<v Speaker 1>that they creators will be less </v>
<v Speaker 1>susceptible to being rapidly shutdown or</v>

321
00:17:03.631 --> 00:17:06.750
<v Speaker 1>perhaps shutdown at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

322
00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:10.840
<v Speaker 1>only a fool would say that that problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>is going to be definitively solved.</v>

323
00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:14.990
<v Speaker 1>I have some real increasing sympathy for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the crypto currency types.</v>

324
00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:16.393
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the problem there is that as far as </v>

325
00:17:18.391 --> 00:17:19.224
<v Speaker 1>I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their solution is still sufficiently </v>

326
00:17:22.171 --> 00:17:23.004
<v Speaker 1>technically complex to keep it out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mainstream use and also not </v>

327
00:17:27.111 --> 00:17:27.944
<v Speaker 1>sufficiently liquid to actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>constitute a realistic current </v>

328
00:17:32.141 --> 00:17:34.180
<v Speaker 1>replacement even for credit cards.</v>

329
00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:35.523
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things we've been </v>

330
00:17:36.071 --> 00:17:36.904
<v Speaker 2>discussing is that it's almost like we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to have several markers down the </v>

331
00:17:40.241 --> 00:17:41.074
<v Speaker 2>road to figure out what the real </v>
<v Speaker 2>solution is because not everything can </v>

332
00:17:44.561 --> 00:17:49.561
<v Speaker 2>be solved in terms of terms of service </v>
<v Speaker 2>tomorrow related to that exists.</v>

333
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:54.870
<v Speaker 2>Not Everything can be solved tomorrow </v>
<v Speaker 2>related to the payment processors may be</v>

334
00:17:54.871 --> 00:17:55.704
<v Speaker 2>crypto really is the ultimate answer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not the answer tomorrow for </v>

335
00:17:59.521 --> 00:18:00.390
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're,</v>

336
00:18:00.391 --> 00:18:03.250
<v Speaker 2>we're really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're plotting out a lot here,</v>

337
00:18:03.251 --> 00:18:07.420
<v Speaker 2>but it seems like a fresh and sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fitting way to start the year.</v>

338
00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:08.140
<v Speaker 2>I think</v>

339
00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:10.990
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so for January 15th I mean,</v>

340
00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:12.910
<v Speaker 1>part of the reason that we picked that </v>
<v Speaker 1>date,</v>

341
00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:14.283
<v Speaker 1>as I said before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was because we thought we might have </v>

342
00:18:15.551 --> 00:18:18.490
<v Speaker 1>something to announce with regards to an</v>
<v Speaker 1>alternative platform,</v>

343
00:18:18.491 --> 00:18:21.720
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saner heads have prevailed in that</v>

344
00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:24.513
<v Speaker 2>calmer heads.</v>

345
00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:25.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

346
00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:26.653
<v Speaker 1>And also we want it to give people an </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to decide what they wanted </v>

347
00:18:29.841 --> 00:18:31.550
<v Speaker 1>to do it without just springing it on </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

348
00:18:31.551 --> 00:18:32.384
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have some real admiration for Harris </v>

349
00:18:34.041 --> 00:18:37.590
<v Speaker 1>for acting so immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Definitively.</v>

350
00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:39.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's funny,</v>

351
00:18:39.171 --> 00:18:40.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw some criticism,</v>

352
00:18:40.641 --> 00:18:41.301
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

353
00:18:41.301 --> 00:18:42.134
<v Speaker 2>well Sam dropped immediately and look </v>
<v Speaker 2>you and Peter said you're still there </v>

354
00:18:44.421 --> 00:18:45.254
<v Speaker 2>and you're talking about this whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing and it's like we all have </v>

355
00:18:47.181 --> 00:18:50.210
<v Speaker 2>different things to consider.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all have different family situations,</v>

356
00:18:50.211 --> 00:18:52.820
<v Speaker 2>different business situations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different livelihood situations,</v>

357
00:18:52.821 --> 00:18:53.654
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like we were really trying to </v>

358
00:18:55.071 --> 00:18:58.040
<v Speaker 2>just plot this thing out properly and to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be very clear,</v>

359
00:18:58.041 --> 00:19:01.550
<v Speaker 2>we're still in the process of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for any sort of,</v>

360
00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:02.403
<v Speaker 2>for anyone watching this right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're supporting Jordan on Patriot </v>

361
00:19:06.261 --> 00:19:08.990
<v Speaker 2>or you're supporting me on Patriot or </v>
<v Speaker 2>both of us or whatever it is,</v>

362
00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:10.213
<v Speaker 2>it's like now we're trying to shift </v>
<v Speaker 2>people because at least by getting off </v>

363
00:19:13.341 --> 00:19:14.174
<v Speaker 2>patriotic the moment we remove one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the middlemen and you can now go </v>

364
00:19:17.841 --> 00:19:18.674
<v Speaker 2>directly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to directly to Jordan b peterson.com </v>

365
00:19:20.811 --> 00:19:24.620
<v Speaker 2>or [inaudible] dot com and you can at </v>
<v Speaker 2>least if you want to donate,</v>

366
00:19:24.621 --> 00:19:28.130
<v Speaker 2>you can do that for now while we figure </v>
<v Speaker 2>out everything else.</v>

367
00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:29.413
<v Speaker 2>And that way we removed one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pieces here because there's just too </v>

368
00:19:31.701 --> 00:19:34.820
<v Speaker 2>many pieces here that are creating this </v>
<v Speaker 2>mess.</v>

369
00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:36.393
<v Speaker 1>I think it's too much to hope for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect solution to a very complex </v>

370
00:19:39.551 --> 00:19:41.150
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

371
00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:42.303
<v Speaker 1>we're muddling through the best we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>and hopefully people will regard our </v>

372
00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:48.003
<v Speaker 1>decision joint decision too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leave Patriot as a step in the right </v>

373
00:19:53.481 --> 00:19:56.570
<v Speaker 1>direction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however imperfectly taken.</v>

374
00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:58.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well look,</v>

375
00:19:58.481 --> 00:20:01.240
<v Speaker 2>I think I said it before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I really think that,</v>

376
00:20:01.241 --> 00:20:04.420
<v Speaker 2>and maybe this will be the defining,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

377
00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:10.170
<v Speaker 2>idea of 2019 is that I think we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically at the point where people have</v>

378
00:20:10.871 --> 00:20:11.704
<v Speaker 2>to decide what sort of internet they </v>
<v Speaker 2>want and it's not only what sort of </v>

379
00:20:15.041 --> 00:20:15.874
<v Speaker 2>internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really what sort of freedom do you </v>

380
00:20:17.651 --> 00:20:22.651
<v Speaker 2>want in a digital world and either or do</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want any or do you want any,</v>

381
00:20:22.901 --> 00:20:25.900
<v Speaker 2>and maybe maybe you don't or you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to think about it and you just want</v>

382
00:20:25.901 --> 00:20:28.660
<v Speaker 2>to play fortnight and watch porn and </v>
<v Speaker 2>never think it through.</v>

383
00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:31.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm assuming that you'll be allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>watch porn,</v>

384
00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:33.183
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that now you really are a pilot or </v>

385
00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:37.020
<v Speaker 1>play for that matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

386
00:20:37.021 --> 00:20:41.100
<v Speaker 1>So the</v>
<v Speaker 1>games of violence should be allowed.</v>

387
00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:44.880
<v Speaker 1>What makes you think that credit card </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies should allow you to use their,</v>

388
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.640
<v Speaker 1>their funds to purchase first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first person shooter games for example,</v>

389
00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:51.490
<v Speaker 1>or any game where anyone has killed?</v>

390
00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:53.220
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're totally right.</v>

391
00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:54.063
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that sounds completely dystopian </v>

392
00:20:55.651 --> 00:20:56.484
<v Speaker 2>and yet it seems like that would just be</v>
<v Speaker 2>the next encroachment that we would see </v>

393
00:20:59.251 --> 00:21:00.450
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the point at the end,</v>

394
00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:04.950
<v Speaker 2>at the end of this is I think everyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>for for 2019 since it's the first day of</v>

395
00:21:04.951 --> 00:21:05.784
<v Speaker 2>the year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like you have to think about what </v>

396
00:21:06.691 --> 00:21:11.430
<v Speaker 2>type of Internet do you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what type of ability to communicate with</v>

397
00:21:11.431 --> 00:21:12.264
<v Speaker 2>other people do you want?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you want something that's a </v>

398
00:21:14.761 --> 00:21:16.530
<v Speaker 2>little better than what we've got right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

399
00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:19.540
<v Speaker 2>we better stand up quick because this </v>
<v Speaker 2>window we,</v>

400
00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:20.523
<v Speaker 2>we know it's closing slowly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we never know when it's going to </v>

401
00:21:22.471 --> 00:21:24.700
<v Speaker 2>really slap shot quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

402
00:21:24.701 --> 00:21:27.780
<v Speaker 2>so we're working on it and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think people are ready to stand up</v>

403
00:21:27.781 --> 00:21:28.620
<v Speaker 2>with us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really do.</v>

404
00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:29.493
<v Speaker 1>We might also suggest to people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is of course up to everyone </v>

405
00:21:32.801 --> 00:21:35.110
<v Speaker 1>who's feeling this to decide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

406
00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:36.993
<v Speaker 1>couple of thousand letters to mastercard</v>
<v Speaker 1>and paypal and visa indicating </v>

407
00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:43.443
<v Speaker 1>pronounced displeasure at their plans to</v>
<v Speaker 1>become a custodians of the monetary </v>

408
00:21:48.881 --> 00:21:52.000
<v Speaker 1>supply for ethical reasons might also be</v>
<v Speaker 1>an order.</v>

409
00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:55.270
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these companies are responsive to public</v>

410
00:21:55.271 --> 00:21:56.104
<v Speaker 1>pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is perhaps partly why they're </v>

411
00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:00.250
<v Speaker 1>determining to play the role of censor </v>
<v Speaker 1>to begin with.</v>

412
00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:01.030
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

413
00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:01.863
<v Speaker 1>they are facing pressure from these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's call them activist interest </v>

414
00:22:05.021 --> 00:22:06.260
<v Speaker 1>groups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who again,</v>

415
00:22:06.261 --> 00:22:09.350
<v Speaker 1>are outlined on change the terms on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>website,</v>

416
00:22:09.351 --> 00:22:13.160
<v Speaker 1>change the terms and they're responding </v>
<v Speaker 1>to public pressure.</v>

417
00:22:13.161 --> 00:22:17.020
<v Speaker 1>And that's understandable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>MMM.</v>

418
00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:20.510
<v Speaker 1>It's understandable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

419
00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:22.893
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but inexcusable in certain in a certain </v>

420
00:22:26.871 --> 00:22:27.704
<v Speaker 1>regard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the right way perhaps to begin to </v>

421
00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:31.693
<v Speaker 1>push back is to let the credit card </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies know that there's a </v>

422
00:22:34.371 --> 00:22:35.204
<v Speaker 1>constituency on the other side that I s </v>
<v Speaker 1>I suspect constitutes the vast majority </v>

423
00:22:40.791 --> 00:22:45.791
<v Speaker 1>of credit card users.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The silent middle majority of let's say,</v>

424
00:22:46.101 --> 00:22:49.850
<v Speaker 1>Western society who were neither </v>
<v Speaker 1>radically right nor radically left,</v>

425
00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:50.983
<v Speaker 1>who would just as soon not have their </v>
<v Speaker 1>spending habits monitored by giant </v>

426
00:22:53.991 --> 00:22:56.760
<v Speaker 1>corporations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty funny too,</v>

427
00:22:56.761 --> 00:23:01.340
<v Speaker 1>that the left is so opposed to corporate</v>
<v Speaker 1>entities,</v>

428
00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:03.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on principle,</v>

429
00:23:03.381 --> 00:23:04.214
<v Speaker 1>especially to sizable ones and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a certain justification for being </v>

430
00:23:07.941 --> 00:23:12.500
<v Speaker 1>skeptical about the moral direction of </v>
<v Speaker 1>very large organizations,</v>

431
00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:13.603
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are so eager to hand over the reigns of </v>

432
00:23:17.061 --> 00:23:17.894
<v Speaker 1>social control to precisely the </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies you'd think they would be </v>

433
00:23:20.541 --> 00:23:23.180
<v Speaker 1>least likely to crawl into bed with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

434
00:23:23.181 --> 00:23:25.590
<v Speaker 1>really mastercard visa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like right.</v>

435
00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:26.653
<v Speaker 2>Or at the same time they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to hand over more control to </v>

436
00:23:28.821 --> 00:23:30.580
<v Speaker 2>the government to handle these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

437
00:23:30.581 --> 00:23:34.010
<v Speaker 2>and we should be pretty clear that in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the last couple of weeks that we've been</v>

438
00:23:34.011 --> 00:23:34.844
<v Speaker 2>discussing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every single discussion that we've had </v>

439
00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:38.213
<v Speaker 2>about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think once did we entertain the </v>

440
00:23:40.141 --> 00:23:40.771
<v Speaker 2>idea of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

441
00:23:40.771 --> 00:23:43.470
<v Speaker 2>we've got to get the government involved</v>
<v Speaker 2>to fix this thing.</v>

442
00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:44.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

443
00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:45.113
<v Speaker 2>there could be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>

444
00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:49.160
<v Speaker 2>as you referenced earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there could be specific legal,</v>

445
00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:52.970
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>issues that pop up related to collusion.</v>

446
00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:55.300
<v Speaker 2>And signed a couple of other things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cartel developed.</v>

447
00:23:55.301 --> 00:23:55.760
<v Speaker 2>Cocked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

448
00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:57.200
<v Speaker 2>like that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

449
00:23:57.370 --> 00:24:00.100
<v Speaker 2>but the beauty of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again why I'm so,</v>

450
00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:04.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm watching my monthly rev of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>company go down even though we're,</v>

451
00:24:04.151 --> 00:24:06.530
<v Speaker 2>we're making some of it back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as I'm watching that happen,</v>

452
00:24:06.531 --> 00:24:08.300
<v Speaker 2>as I said to you last time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

453
00:24:08.301 --> 00:24:09.134
<v Speaker 2>I'm incredibly inspired right now </v>
<v Speaker 2>because literally thousands of emails </v>

454
00:24:13.281 --> 00:24:15.920
<v Speaker 2>are pouring in from people that want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>work with us,</v>

455
00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:16.783
<v Speaker 2>that want to help us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that want to figure out how to fund </v>

456
00:24:19.191 --> 00:24:21.950
<v Speaker 2>things or that want to work as engineers</v>
<v Speaker 2>or the rest of it.</v>

457
00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:25.310
<v Speaker 2>And that tells you that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that people are,</v>

458
00:24:25.311 --> 00:24:26.144
<v Speaker 2>people are afraid and they see this </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem and they just want some </v>

459
00:24:28.821 --> 00:24:32.300
<v Speaker 2>solutions and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe there isn't an easy solution.</v>

460
00:24:32.301 --> 00:24:33.134
<v Speaker 2>As you said,</v>

461
00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:34.273
<v Speaker 1>there have also been talking with you </v>
<v Speaker 1>online with a whole bunch of the people </v>

462
00:24:37.341 --> 00:24:41.330
<v Speaker 1>who've been loosely aggregated under the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ages of the intellectual dark web.</v>

463
00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:45.050
<v Speaker 1>And that's probably 30 people that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we've been communicating with,</v>

464
00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:46.213
<v Speaker 1>with a variety of peripheral people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's also useful to let people know </v>

465
00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:51.613
<v Speaker 1>that every one of those people is </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably concerned about what </v>

466
00:24:55.491 --> 00:24:57.370
<v Speaker 1>happened to Carl Benjamin to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

467
00:24:57.410 --> 00:24:58.041
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go on.</v>

468
00:24:58.041 --> 00:24:58.874
<v Speaker 1>And even more so</v>
<v Speaker 1>dumbstruck by the collusion payment </v>

469
00:25:04.621 --> 00:25:05.454
<v Speaker 1>processing companies and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the emergence of this activist </v>

470
00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:10.223
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure online that's devoted </v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically to the suppression of free </v>

471
00:25:15.211 --> 00:25:16.044
<v Speaker 1>speech.</v>

472
00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:20.950
<v Speaker 2>And also we should also note that within</v>
<v Speaker 2>that group of say 30 or so white people,</v>

473
00:25:20.951 --> 00:25:25.470
<v Speaker 2>we all sort of look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we agree on basic fundamental principles</v>

474
00:25:25.471 --> 00:25:27.090
<v Speaker 2>related to free speech and things like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

475
00:25:27.091 --> 00:25:30.000
<v Speaker 2>but there's a lot of disagreement on how</v>
<v Speaker 2>to move forward with this.</v>

476
00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:30.893
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking it out respectfully as we </v>

477
00:25:31.831 --> 00:25:33.510
<v Speaker 2>always do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but some people are saying,</v>

478
00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:35.940
<v Speaker 2>stay in fight on Patrion because this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

479
00:25:35.941 --> 00:25:36.774
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're small enough say that you might </v>

480
00:25:38.251 --> 00:25:40.470
<v Speaker 2>get them to change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people are saying you gotta go.</v>

481
00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:43.020
<v Speaker 2>That's when people are saying some </v>
<v Speaker 2>version of,</v>

482
00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:43.973
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mixing those</v>

483
00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:47.170
<v Speaker 1>and nobody's clear about the proper </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathway forward.</v>

484
00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:49.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's again,</v>

485
00:25:49.611 --> 00:25:50.444
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think this is what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>brilliance of human ingenuity is all </v>

486
00:25:52.971 --> 00:25:54.320
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like we're,</v>

487
00:25:54.321 --> 00:25:55.154
<v Speaker 2>they're going to be some pitfalls in </v>
<v Speaker 2>front of us and staying would have its </v>

488
00:25:57.171 --> 00:26:00.460
<v Speaker 2>risks and leaving would average risks </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're all going to do what we think</v>

489
00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:02.550
<v Speaker 1>is why we've already discussed that too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

490
00:26:02.551 --> 00:26:04.110
<v Speaker 1>is that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>

491
00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:07.210
<v Speaker 1>there's no known risk option here and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

492
00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:09.213
<v Speaker 1>and so we're taking the risk of leaving </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we're gonna make the best of </v>

493
00:26:12.701 --> 00:26:14.440
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean often when you take a risky,</v>

494
00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:15.483
<v Speaker 1>often in life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all you have is a choice between two </v>

495
00:26:17.111 --> 00:26:20.950
<v Speaker 1>different risks and sometimes neither of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them are risks you would like to take.</v>

496
00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:22.273
<v Speaker 1>Then in the aftermath of that decision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a new field of possibility opens up in </v>

497
00:26:26.561 --> 00:26:27.394
<v Speaker 1>front of you too and whether or not you </v>
<v Speaker 1>made the right decision is actually a </v>

498
00:26:29.801 --> 00:26:33.460
<v Speaker 1>consequence of how well you manage the </v>
<v Speaker 1>aftermath of that decision.</v>

499
00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:34.773
<v Speaker 1>So we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll keep talking over the next couple </v>

500
00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:42.250
<v Speaker 1>of months on like I've got good people </v>
<v Speaker 1>working on this alternative,</v>

501
00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:43.841
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

502
00:26:43.841 --> 00:26:47.740
<v Speaker 1>which was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I mentioned in other places,</v>

503
00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:53.140
<v Speaker 1>started seven months ago or so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And good people supervising it,</v>

504
00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:57.150
<v Speaker 1>whether it'll turn out to be a viable </v>
<v Speaker 1>product and whether or not we can figure</v>

505
00:26:57.151 --> 00:27:01.410
<v Speaker 1>out how to implement it in a sustainable</v>
<v Speaker 1>way that actually addresses these issues</v>

506
00:27:01.411 --> 00:27:03.880
<v Speaker 1>in a reasonable manner remains to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>seen</v>

507
00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:06.240
<v Speaker 2>on a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a personal note,</v>

508
00:27:06.241 --> 00:27:07.170
<v Speaker 2>just because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

509
00:27:07.171 --> 00:27:08.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to see you a couple of days before</v>

510
00:27:08.881 --> 00:27:11.630
<v Speaker 2>Christmas in West Palm Beach and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we had dinner with uh,</v>

511
00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:13.140
<v Speaker 2>with your family and your kids and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

512
00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:14.193
<v Speaker 2>It hasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of been nice cause I did a </v>

513
00:27:15.391 --> 00:27:16.230
<v Speaker 2>week with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

514
00:27:16.231 --> 00:27:18.960
<v Speaker 2>with my brother and sister and nieces </v>
<v Speaker 2>and nephews over Christmas.</v>

515
00:27:18.961 --> 00:27:22.710
<v Speaker 2>Also sort of circling back to family on </v>
<v Speaker 2>some of this.</v>

516
00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:22.941
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

517
00:27:22.941 --> 00:27:25.500
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's given me a lot of perspective.</v>

518
00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:26.790
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it it mean cause I'm getting,</v>

519
00:27:26.791 --> 00:27:27.624
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting reached out by so many </v>
<v Speaker 2>different people on all different </v>

520
00:27:29.491 --> 00:27:30.324
<v Speaker 2>fronts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then to have sort of a close knit </v>

521
00:27:31.921 --> 00:27:35.730
<v Speaker 2>group of people that really do have your</v>
<v Speaker 2>interest in mind and all those things</v>

522
00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:39.180
<v Speaker 2>with your kids at dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>

523
00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:41.430
<v Speaker 2>oh these are good people to</v>

524
00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:43.443
<v Speaker 1>nymity on the part of the people around </v>
<v Speaker 1>me that the proper thing to do is </v>

525
00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:47.763
<v Speaker 1>twofold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is to separate myself from Patrion </v>

526
00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:51.723
<v Speaker 1>in accordance with our discussions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the second is to proceed with </v>

527
00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:59.360
<v Speaker 1>exceeding caution and not over promise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

528
00:27:59.390 --> 00:28:04.390
<v Speaker 1>or try to deliver to quickly a solution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although to work on that carefully.</v>

529
00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:06.860
<v Speaker 1>So that's what we've decided to do.</v>

530
00:28:07.030 --> 00:28:07.863
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's just be crystal clear on that </v>

531
00:28:08.861 --> 00:28:09.970
<v Speaker 2>latter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>latter part.</v>

532
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.850
<v Speaker 2>We are working on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to be deliberate.</v>

533
00:28:12.851 --> 00:28:13.684
<v Speaker 2>We are going to be cautious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We understand that it can't be solved </v>

534
00:28:16.361 --> 00:28:17.194
<v Speaker 2>tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We understand that there's a financial </v>

535
00:28:19.001 --> 00:28:19.834
<v Speaker 2>part of free speech part and everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>else and we're just going to lay these </v>

536
00:28:22.541 --> 00:28:23.374
<v Speaker 2>things out in front of us and we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to keep working through it with a </v>

537
00:28:24.731 --> 00:28:27.550
<v Speaker 2>lot of the people that you guys know and</v>
<v Speaker 2>trust and,</v>

538
00:28:27.551 --> 00:28:28.990
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and with,</v>

539
00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:30.260
<v Speaker 2>with some other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

540
00:28:30.261 --> 00:28:32.500
<v Speaker 2>and hearing from random people that have</v>
<v Speaker 2>given us ideas.</v>

541
00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:34.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been forwarding you emails left and</v>

542
00:28:34.331 --> 00:28:35.380
<v Speaker 2>right where people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

543
00:28:35.381 --> 00:28:36.214
<v Speaker 2>this might be the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pressure point you might want to go </v>

544
00:28:38.441 --> 00:28:39.880
<v Speaker 2>after,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we're just going to keep,</v>

545
00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:42.190
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

546
00:28:42.490 --> 00:28:43.323
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I got a couple of things to end </v>

547
00:28:45.371 --> 00:28:47.410
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess let's summarize it then.</v>

548
00:28:47.411 --> 00:28:49.600
<v Speaker 1>I've got a couple of things just to let </v>
<v Speaker 1>people know about.</v>

549
00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:54.180
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the first is,</v>

550
00:28:54.181 --> 00:28:55.014
<v Speaker 1>so we're both leaving on January 15th </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the second is we're working on this </v>

551
00:28:57.691 --> 00:28:58.524
<v Speaker 1>platform and the third is a warning to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people to keep a close eye on what the </v>

552
00:29:02.191 --> 00:29:03.024
<v Speaker 1>credit card companies are up to because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a really bad thing in my </v>

553
00:29:05.251 --> 00:29:08.920
<v Speaker 1>estimation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's probably it on my front.</v>

554
00:29:08.921 --> 00:29:09.754
<v Speaker 1>I have a talk coming up in Zurich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a couple of talks in California </v>

555
00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:15.670
<v Speaker 1>in January.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be with you on those.</v>

556
00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:16.583
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the tickets to those are available </v>

557
00:29:17.981 --> 00:29:22.981
<v Speaker 1>on my website@jordanbpeterson.com and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the final thing is I also set up with my</v>

558
00:29:23.291 --> 00:29:24.124
<v Speaker 1>partners as a new years token.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say that future authoring program </v>

559
00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:30.233
<v Speaker 1>from the self authoring suite and we put</v>
<v Speaker 1>it up at 50% off with the code and why </v>

560
00:29:34.861 --> 00:29:39.861
<v Speaker 1>2019 and so if anybody's out there wants</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make some personal,</v>

561
00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:43.540
<v Speaker 1>what do you call those resolutions for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the New Year,</v>

562
00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:46.270
<v Speaker 1>then this program is an ideal way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing that.</v>

563
00:29:46.271 --> 00:29:50.360
<v Speaker 1>And so that's also partly a thank you to</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone who um,</v>

564
00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:54.420
<v Speaker 1>has been so supportive and interested in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last year.</v>

565
00:29:55.050 --> 00:29:59.740
<v Speaker 1>And so I think that's basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's basically that.</v>

566
00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:00.963
<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>

567
00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:02.680
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's basically it.</v>

568
00:30:02.681 --> 00:30:07.681
<v Speaker 2>So I'll just quickly give a shout out to</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dave rubin.com/donate and what we're,</v>

569
00:30:07.901 --> 00:30:08.734
<v Speaker 2>what we're trying to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I know you're trying to do this as </v>

570
00:30:10.091 --> 00:30:10.924
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that for whoever signs up now and </v>

571
00:30:12.521 --> 00:30:13.271
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're taking,</v>

<v Speaker 2>once we build out whatever it is we're </v>

574
00:30:19.901 --> 00:30:20.734
<v Speaker 2>working on that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it'll all be able to be flipped </v>

<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

579
00:30:30.311 --> 00:30:32.980
<v Speaker 2>We're trying to make this as easy as </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible for everybody.</v>

580
00:30:32.981 --> 00:30:34.630
<v Speaker 2>And they'll look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be some bumps,</v>

581
00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:35.493
