00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.710
<v Speaker 1>Good afternoon and welcome colleagues </v>
<v Speaker 1>invited guests,</v>

2
00:00:08.711 --> 00:00:09.544
<v Speaker 1>members of the general public who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>following today's proceedings of the </v>

3
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.910
<v Speaker 1>Standing Senate committee on legal and </v>
<v Speaker 1>constitutional affairs.</v>

4
00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:17.583
<v Speaker 1>Today we continue our consideration of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill CC and act to amend the Canadian </v>

5
00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.610
<v Speaker 1>Human Rights Act and the criminal code.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And with this,</v>

6
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.473
<v Speaker 1>our last day of hearings on the bill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we will move to clause by clause </v>

7
00:00:30.881 --> 00:00:31.714
<v Speaker 1>consideration tomorrow with us today for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first hour or Jordan b Peterson </v>

8
00:00:36.881 --> 00:00:37.714
<v Speaker 1>professors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology department at the University </v>

9
00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.210
<v Speaker 1>of Toronto and from the D dot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jared Brown Professional Corporation,</v>

10
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.050
<v Speaker 1>a d,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jared brown lead counsel.</v>

11
00:00:47.051 --> 00:00:49.450
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you gentlemen for being here.</v>

12
00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.320
<v Speaker 1>You both have up to five minutes for </v>
<v Speaker 1>opening statements.</v>

13
00:00:53.321 --> 00:00:56.230
<v Speaker 1>And Mr Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe you're going to lead off.</v>

14
00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:57.610
<v Speaker 2>Yes sir.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The floor is yours.</v>

15
00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:01.323
<v Speaker 2>So I think the first thing I'd like to </v>
<v Speaker 2>bring up is that it's not obvious when </v>

16
00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.210
<v Speaker 2>considering a matter of this sort what </v>
<v Speaker 2>level of analysis is appropriate.</v>

17
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.290
<v Speaker 2>If you're reading any given document,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can look at the words or the phrases</v>

18
00:01:14.291 --> 00:01:15.124
<v Speaker 2>are the sentences or the complete </v>
<v Speaker 2>document or you can look at the broader </v>

19
00:01:17.801 --> 00:01:22.801
<v Speaker 2>context within which it is likely to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>interpreted and when I first encountered</v>

20
00:01:23.231 --> 00:01:25.960
<v Speaker 2>bill [inaudible] and its surrounding </v>
<v Speaker 2>policies,</v>

21
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:27.063
<v Speaker 2>it seemed to me that the appropriate </v>
<v Speaker 2>level of analysis was to look at the </v>

22
00:01:29.891 --> 00:01:32.500
<v Speaker 2>context of interpretation surrounding </v>
<v Speaker 2>the bill,</v>

23
00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:33.663
<v Speaker 2>which is what I did when I went and </v>
<v Speaker 2>scoured the Ontario Human Rights </v>

24
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.630
<v Speaker 2>Commission webpages and examine its </v>
<v Speaker 2>policies.</v>

25
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.033
<v Speaker 2>I did that because at that point the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Department of Justice had clearly </v>

26
00:01:44.651 --> 00:01:45.484
<v Speaker 2>indicated on their website in a link </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was later taken down that bill see </v>

27
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.993
<v Speaker 2>16 would be interpreted in within the </v>
<v Speaker 2>precedence policy precedence already </v>

28
00:01:54.521 --> 00:01:56.770
<v Speaker 2>established by the Ontario Human Rights </v>
<v Speaker 2>Commission.</v>

29
00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.920
<v Speaker 2>So when I looked on the website,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

30
00:01:59.921 --> 00:02:02.110
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's broader issues at stake here.</v>

31
00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.810
<v Speaker 2>And I tried to outline some of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>broader issues.</v>

32
00:02:04.811 --> 00:02:07.330
<v Speaker 2>In the initial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You may or may not know.</v>

33
00:02:07.331 --> 00:02:12.331
<v Speaker 2>I made some videos criticizing bill c 16</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's and a number of.</v>

34
00:02:12.371 --> 00:02:14.920
<v Speaker 2>It's a of the policies that surrounding </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

35
00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.143
<v Speaker 2>And I think the most egregious elements </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the policies are that it requires </v>

36
00:02:21.131 --> 00:02:22.900
<v Speaker 2>compelled speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

37
00:02:22.901 --> 00:02:23.734
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Ontario Human Rights Commission </v>

38
00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:27.483
<v Speaker 2>explicitly states that refusing to refer</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a person by their self identified </v>

39
00:02:31.511 --> 00:02:32.344
<v Speaker 2>name and proper personal pronoun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the pronouns that I was </v>

40
00:02:35.381 --> 00:02:40.381
<v Speaker 2>objecting to a can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the can be interpreted as harassment.</v>

41
00:02:41.351 --> 00:02:42.184
<v Speaker 2>And so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's explicitly defined in the </v>

42
00:02:43.721 --> 00:02:45.350
<v Speaker 2>relevant policies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

43
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.570
<v Speaker 2>so I think that's appalling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all because there hasn't been a</v>

44
00:02:49.571 --> 00:02:50.404
<v Speaker 2>piece of legislation that requires </v>
<v Speaker 2>Canadians to utter a particular form of </v>

45
00:02:54.161 --> 00:02:57.850
<v Speaker 2>address that has particular ideological </v>
<v Speaker 2>implications before.</v>

46
00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.220
<v Speaker 2>And I think that it's aligned that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't cross.</v>

47
00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.250
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I think that the,</v>

48
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.200
<v Speaker 2>the definition of identity that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>enshrined in the surrounding policies is</v>

49
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.240
<v Speaker 2>ill defined and poorly thought through </v>
<v Speaker 2>and also incorrect.</v>

50
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.983
<v Speaker 2>It's incorrect in that identity is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>and will never be something that people </v>

51
00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:22.234
<v Speaker 2>define subjectively because your </v>
<v Speaker 2>identity is something that you actually </v>

52
00:03:24.581 --> 00:03:28.750
<v Speaker 2>have to act out in the world as a set of</v>
<v Speaker 2>procedural tools,</v>

53
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:29.793
<v Speaker 2>which most people learn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm being technical about this </v>

54
00:03:31.931 --> 00:03:36.040
<v Speaker 2>between the ages of two and four.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a fundamental human reality.</v>

55
00:03:36.041 --> 00:03:38.620
<v Speaker 2>It's well recognized by the relevant </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

56
00:03:38.621 --> 00:03:39.454
<v Speaker 2>developmental psychological authorities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so the idea that identity is </v>

57
00:03:43.031 --> 00:03:43.864
<v Speaker 2>something that you define purely </v>
<v Speaker 2>subjectively is an idea without status </v>

58
00:03:47.171 --> 00:03:50.920
<v Speaker 2>as far as I'm concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also think it's unbelievably dangerous</v>

59
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.053
<v Speaker 2>for us to move towards a representing a </v>
<v Speaker 2>social constructionist view of identity </v>

60
00:03:57.521 --> 00:03:58.660
<v Speaker 2>in our legal system.</v>

61
00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:59.793
<v Speaker 2>The social constructionist view insists </v>
<v Speaker 2>that human identity is nothing but a </v>

62
00:04:02.771 --> 00:04:06.340
<v Speaker 2>consequence of socialization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is which and,</v>

63
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.420
<v Speaker 2>and there's an inordinate amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientific evidence suggesting that that</v>

64
00:04:11.681 --> 00:04:12.514
<v Speaker 2>happens to not be the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the reason that this is being </v>

65
00:04:16.061 --> 00:04:16.894
<v Speaker 2>instantiated into law is because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are promoting that sort of </v>

66
00:04:20.771 --> 00:04:21.604
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or at least in part because the people </v>

67
00:04:22.781 --> 00:04:23.614
<v Speaker 2>who are promoting that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective know perfectly well that </v>

68
00:04:25.241 --> 00:04:27.910
<v Speaker 2>they've lost the battle completely on </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientific grounds.</v>

69
00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:29.253
<v Speaker 2>It's implicit in the policies of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ontario Human Rights Commission that </v>

70
00:04:32.321 --> 00:04:33.920
<v Speaker 2>sexual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

71
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.520
<v Speaker 2>identity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a biological sex,</v>

72
00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.950
<v Speaker 2>gender identity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gender expression,</v>

73
00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.013
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexual proclivity all vary </v>

74
00:04:42.041 --> 00:04:44.230
<v Speaker 2>independently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's simply not the case.</v>

75
00:04:44.231 --> 00:04:47.080
<v Speaker 2>It's not the case scientifically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not the case factually.</v>

76
00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.153
<v Speaker 2>And it's certainly not something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>should be increasingly taught to people </v>

77
00:04:50.681 --> 00:04:52.420
<v Speaker 2>in high schools,</v>
<v Speaker 2>elementary schools,</v>

78
00:04:52.421 --> 00:04:53.980
<v Speaker 2>and junior high schools,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which it is,</v>

79
00:04:53.981 --> 00:04:55.180
<v Speaker 2>and it is being taught.</v>

80
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.133
<v Speaker 2>I included this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a cartoon character that I find </v>

81
00:04:59.981 --> 00:05:00.814
<v Speaker 2>particularly reprehensible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aimed obviously at it as it is at </v>

82
00:05:03.551 --> 00:05:04.384
<v Speaker 2>children's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere around the age of seven that </v>

83
00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.873
<v Speaker 2>contains within it the implicit can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>implicit claims as a consequence of its </v>

84
00:05:10.691 --> 00:05:14.470
<v Speaker 2>graphic mode of expression that these </v>
<v Speaker 2>elements of identity,</v>

85
00:05:14.471 --> 00:05:16.780
<v Speaker 2>our first canonical and second </v>
<v Speaker 2>independent.</v>

86
00:05:16.781 --> 00:05:19.600
<v Speaker 2>And neither of those happened to be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>case.</v>

87
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:21.003
<v Speaker 2>I think that the inclusion of gender </v>
<v Speaker 2>expression in the bill is something </v>

88
00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.830
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily peculiar given that </v>
<v Speaker 2>gender expression is not a group.</v>

89
00:05:29.831 --> 00:05:32.680
<v Speaker 2>And that according to the Ontario Human </v>
<v Speaker 2>Rights Commission,</v>

90
00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:37.810
<v Speaker 2>it deals with things as mundane as how </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior and outward appearance,</v>

91
00:05:37.811 --> 00:05:39.310
<v Speaker 2>such as dress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hair,</v>

92
00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.230
<v Speaker 2>makeup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>body language,</v>

93
00:05:41.231 --> 00:05:43.540
<v Speaker 2>and voice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which now as far as I can tell,</v>

94
00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.710
<v Speaker 2>a open people to charges of hate crime </v>
<v Speaker 2>under bill [inaudible] 16,</v>

95
00:05:47.711 --> 00:05:50.350
<v Speaker 2>if they dare to criticize the manner of </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone's dress,</v>

96
00:05:50.351 --> 00:05:53.020
<v Speaker 2>which seems to me to be an entirely </v>
<v Speaker 2>voluntary issue.</v>

97
00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:58.650
<v Speaker 2>So I think that the Ontario Human Rights</v>
<v Speaker 2>Commission's,</v>

98
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:00.253
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>attitude towards vicarious liability is </v>

99
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:03.133
<v Speaker 2>designed specifically to be punitive in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it makes employer's responsible </v>

100
00:06:07.491 --> 00:06:08.690
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

101
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.823
<v Speaker 2>harassment or discrimination,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including the failure to use a </v>

102
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.830
<v Speaker 2>preferred,</v>
<v Speaker 2>preferred pronouns.</v>

103
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:16.723
<v Speaker 2>They have vicarious liability for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether or not they know what's </v>

104
00:06:19.491 --> 00:06:20.324
<v Speaker 2>happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether or not the harassment was and </v>

105
00:06:22.731 --> 00:06:25.610
<v Speaker 2>whether or not the harassment was </v>
<v Speaker 2>intended or unintended.</v>

106
00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.370
<v Speaker 2>So all stopped with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

107
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:29.263
<v Speaker 2>Mr Brown.</v>

108
00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.033
<v Speaker 3>I'm a litigator in Toronto,</v>
<v Speaker 3>act and all manner of commercial and </v>

109
00:06:33.501 --> 00:06:36.170
<v Speaker 3>employment disputes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not an academic.</v>

110
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.250
<v Speaker 3>I live with my clients in the land </v>
<v Speaker 3>illegal reality and how the law actually</v>

111
00:06:40.251 --> 00:06:42.680
<v Speaker 3>works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>About two years ago,</v>

112
00:06:42.681 --> 00:06:43.514
<v Speaker 3>I began to see claims of discrimination </v>
<v Speaker 3>included in every employment related ct </v>

113
00:06:46.221 --> 00:06:47.054
<v Speaker 3>claim.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My phone now rings weekly with human </v>

114
00:06:49.491 --> 00:06:50.510
<v Speaker 3>rights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tribunal matters.</v>

115
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.810
<v Speaker 3>It has become a reality for employers </v>
<v Speaker 3>across Canada.</v>

116
00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.440
<v Speaker 3>In August of last year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I became aware of Dr Jordan Pearson.</v>

117
00:06:58.430 --> 00:06:59.200
<v Speaker 3>He was discussing</v>

118
00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.630
<v Speaker 2>what he saw as a problematic law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>poorly written.</v>

119
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.730
<v Speaker 3>That's when I observed the oddest thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>happening.</v>

120
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:07.160
<v Speaker 3>Lawyers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>academic lawyers,</v>

121
00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:10.460
<v Speaker 3>important people began to say that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>had the legal stuff wrong.</v>

122
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.480
<v Speaker 3>Nothing unusual about this bill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they also said,</v>

123
00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.450
<v Speaker 3>you don't get to go to jail if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>breach a human rights tribunal order.</v>

124
00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:19.273
<v Speaker 3>What was happening is they weren't </v>
<v Speaker 3>defending the law but downplaying its </v>

125
00:07:21.801 --> 00:07:23.510
<v Speaker 3>effects.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

126
00:07:23.511 --> 00:07:24.344
<v Speaker 3>as a practicing lawyer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anytime a lawyer and particularly an </v>

127
00:07:27.111 --> 00:07:28.670
<v Speaker 3>academic says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look away,</v>

128
00:07:28.671 --> 00:07:31.370
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing to see here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gets my antenna way up.</v>

129
00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:33.643
<v Speaker 3>So I did some research which can be </v>
<v Speaker 3>found in the brief that I filed in </v>

130
00:07:35.811 --> 00:07:38.480
<v Speaker 3>advance of today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sets out the path,</v>

131
00:07:38.481 --> 00:07:42.980
<v Speaker 3>the prison on this I knew as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>commercial litigator that anyone can end</v>

132
00:07:42.981 --> 00:07:45.230
<v Speaker 3>up in jail if you breach a tribunal </v>
<v Speaker 3>order.</v>

133
00:07:45.231 --> 00:07:47.960
<v Speaker 3>It is a simple civil contempt of court </v>
<v Speaker 3>process.</v>

134
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:51.620
<v Speaker 3>People go to jail for this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what about the freedom of expression</v>

135
00:07:51.621 --> 00:07:52.454
<v Speaker 3>issue?</v>

136
00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:56.300
<v Speaker 3>It's a foundational issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We all know that section two,</v>

137
00:07:56.301 --> 00:08:00.290
<v Speaker 3>b of the charter sets out that everybody</v>
<v Speaker 3>has the fundamental freedoms of thought,</v>

138
00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:02.390
<v Speaker 3>belief,</v>
<v Speaker 3>opinion and expression,</v>

139
00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:04.213
<v Speaker 3>and we all know that the government is </v>
<v Speaker 3>successfully restricted freedom of </v>

140
00:08:05.781 --> 00:08:09.050
<v Speaker 3>expression over the years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what if rather than restricting what</v>

141
00:08:09.051 --> 00:08:09.884
<v Speaker 3>you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the government actually mandated what </v>

142
00:08:11.481 --> 00:08:14.240
<v Speaker 3>you must say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>

143
00:08:14.241 --> 00:08:16.460
<v Speaker 3>instead of legislating that you cannot </v>
<v Speaker 3>defame someone.</v>

144
00:08:16.461 --> 00:08:18.200
<v Speaker 3>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the government says,</v>

145
00:08:18.201 --> 00:08:20.030
<v Speaker 3>when you speak about a particular </v>
<v Speaker 3>subject,</v>

146
00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:20.893
<v Speaker 3>let's say gender,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you must use this government approved </v>

147
00:08:23.721 --> 00:08:24.554
<v Speaker 3>set of words and theories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The American jurisprudence clearly </v>

148
00:08:27.681 --> 00:08:32.450
<v Speaker 3>defines this is unconstitutional </v>
<v Speaker 3>compelled speech in Canada.</v>

149
00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:33.313
<v Speaker 3>The Supreme Court has annunciated the </v>
<v Speaker 3>principle that anything that forces </v>

150
00:08:36.441 --> 00:08:39.560
<v Speaker 3>someone to express opinions that are not</v>
<v Speaker 3>their own is a penalty.</v>

151
00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:40.753
<v Speaker 3>That is to Talbot's Herrion and as such,</v>
<v Speaker 3>alien to the tradition of free nations </v>

152
00:08:43.971 --> 00:08:44.804
<v Speaker 3>like Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now to see [inaudible] get us to </v>

153
00:08:46.911 --> 00:08:49.650
<v Speaker 3>compelled speech,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Minister of Justice is summarized.</v>

154
00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:53.780
<v Speaker 3>Bill see 16 as the enactment amends the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Canadian Human Rights Act to that gender</v>

155
00:08:53.781 --> 00:08:54.614
<v Speaker 3>identity and gender expression to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>list of prohibited grounds of </v>

156
00:08:56.581 --> 00:08:57.414
<v Speaker 3>discrimination.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Department of Justice website used </v>

157
00:09:00.931 --> 00:09:01.764
<v Speaker 3>to say that we must look to the Ontario </v>
<v Speaker 3>Human Rights Commission policies for </v>

158
00:09:03.991 --> 00:09:04.824
<v Speaker 3>definitions on these terms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ontario's policies on gender identity </v>

159
00:09:08.281 --> 00:09:09.114
<v Speaker 3>and gender expression are so my brief.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They state that gender based harassment </v>

160
00:09:12.061 --> 00:09:15.750
<v Speaker 3>can involve refusing to refer to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>person by their self identified name and</v>

161
00:09:15.751 --> 00:09:16.584
<v Speaker 3>proper personal pronoun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>refusing to refer to a trans person by </v>

162
00:09:19.231 --> 00:09:20.064
<v Speaker 3>their chosen name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a personal pronoun that matches </v>

163
00:09:21.601 --> 00:09:24.180
<v Speaker 3>their gender identity will likely be </v>
<v Speaker 3>discrimination.</v>

164
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:25.703
<v Speaker 3>The law's otherwise unsettled as to </v>
<v Speaker 3>whether someone can insist on any one </v>

165
00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:30.083
<v Speaker 3>gender neutral pronoun in particularly </v>
<v Speaker 3>if the Harasser didn't know or didn't </v>

166
00:09:32.821 --> 00:09:34.590
<v Speaker 3>intend to harass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's still harassment.</v>

167
00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.030
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why is this important?</v>

168
00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.433
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Ontario Human Rights Commission as a </v>

169
00:09:38.341 --> 00:09:40.200
<v Speaker 3>policy development creature of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>legislature,</v>

170
00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.140
<v Speaker 3>it creates the policies which interpret </v>
<v Speaker 3>the code,</v>

171
00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:47.340
<v Speaker 3>but what is most important,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the tribunal must follow these policies.</v>

172
00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:52.620
<v Speaker 3>It is bound by them so the commission </v>
<v Speaker 3>creates the law on pronouns and Ontario.</v>

173
00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:53.583
<v Speaker 3>The policies on pronouns were introduced</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the legal framework after the law </v>

174
00:09:56.071 --> 00:10:00.930
<v Speaker 3>had left the legislature federally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same process will be followed as the</v>

175
00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:01.763
<v Speaker 3>Department of Justice had said so a </v>
<v Speaker 3>similar guideline will be developed as </v>

176
00:10:04.381 --> 00:10:05.214
<v Speaker 3>with the Ontario policies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Federal guidelines must be followed by </v>

177
00:10:07.411 --> 00:10:10.470
<v Speaker 3>the federal tribunal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guidelines will mandate pronouns.</v>

178
00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:12.390
<v Speaker 3>This will happen after the bill leaves </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Senate,</v>

179
00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:16.410
<v Speaker 3>mandating use of pronouns requires one </v>
<v Speaker 3>to use words that are not their own,</v>

180
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:20.130
<v Speaker 3>which imply a belief in or an agreement </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a certain theory on gender.</v>

181
00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:21.593
<v Speaker 3>If you try to disavow that theory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can be brought before the human </v>

182
00:10:23.791 --> 00:10:27.640
<v Speaker 3>rights commission for Ms Dot gendering </v>
<v Speaker 3>or potentially find yourself guilty of a</v>

183
00:10:27.641 --> 00:10:30.300
<v Speaker 3>hate crime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To sum up on the subject of gender,</v>

184
00:10:30.301 --> 00:10:34.740
<v Speaker 3>we're going to have government mandated </v>
<v Speaker 3>speech now in a on the constitutionality</v>

185
00:10:34.741 --> 00:10:35.574
<v Speaker 3>of the proposed bill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Department of Justice said on its </v>

186
00:10:37.531 --> 00:10:38.490
<v Speaker 3>website,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

187
00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:41.160
<v Speaker 3>there's a variation of this bill that </v>
<v Speaker 3>already exists in most of the provinces.</v>

188
00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:46.200
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe that's a robust argument</v>
<v Speaker 3>in favor of constitutionality.</v>

189
00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:48.323
<v Speaker 3>I would refer you to the comments of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>now Chief Justice Mclaughlin of the </v>

190
00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:51.920
<v Speaker 3>Supreme Court and the decision to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Taylor.</v>

191
00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:55.330
<v Speaker 3>It's in my brief.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The chilling effect of leaving overbroad</v>

192
00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:57.960
<v Speaker 3>provisions on the books cannot be </v>
<v Speaker 3>ignored.</v>

193
00:10:58.110 --> 00:10:58.943
<v Speaker 3>While the chilling effect of human </v>
<v Speaker 3>rights legislation is likely to be less </v>

194
00:11:01.291 --> 00:11:03.480
<v Speaker 3>significant than that of a criminal </v>
<v Speaker 3>prohibition,</v>

195
00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:04.583
<v Speaker 3>the vagueness of the law means it may </v>
<v Speaker 3>well determine more conduct than can </v>

196
00:11:06.841 --> 00:11:09.750
<v Speaker 3>legitimately be targeted as a lawyer on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ground,</v>

197
00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:10.913
<v Speaker 3>I worry about poorly drafted a poorly </v>
<v Speaker 3>drafted law and its impact on my </v>

198
00:11:13.261 --> 00:11:14.940
<v Speaker 3>clients.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As a Canadian,</v>

199
00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:17.940
<v Speaker 3>I worry about parliament tacitly </v>
<v Speaker 3>authorizing compelled speech.</v>

200
00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:19.883
<v Speaker 3>The brief I provided to the committee </v>
<v Speaker 3>contains a comprehensive legal opinion </v>

201
00:11:22.441 --> 00:11:25.410
<v Speaker 3>that I published back in December on </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>

202
00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:26.543
<v Speaker 3>There's a table that shows how the </v>
<v Speaker 3>federal human rights regime mirrors the </v>

203
00:11:28.891 --> 00:11:33.100
<v Speaker 3>Ontario system in terms of enforcement </v>
<v Speaker 3>of policies and guidance or wrap up sir.</v>

204
00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:34.573
<v Speaker 3>And finally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it includes the case law that underpins </v>

205
00:11:36.301 --> 00:11:37.530
<v Speaker 3>the opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

206
00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:39.013
<v Speaker 3>Thank you both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we'll begin the questions beginning </v>

207
00:11:41.851 --> 00:11:42.684
<v Speaker 3>with a different.</v>

208
00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:43.990
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Baker.</v>

209
00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:45.323
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you Mr. Chairman and thank you to </v>

210
00:11:46.681 --> 00:11:51.681
<v Speaker 1>the witnesses for their presentation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As the witnesses know,</v>

211
00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:58.310
<v Speaker 1>the nine provinces in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

212
00:11:58.480 --> 00:11:59.313
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

213
00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:00.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

214
00:12:00.911 --> 00:12:01.744
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the provision in their laws including </v>

215
00:12:06.221 --> 00:12:07.054
<v Speaker 1>Ontario and also the words expression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I recall appears in four or five </v>

216
00:12:13.001 --> 00:12:14.780
<v Speaker 1>provinces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

217
00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:20.670
<v Speaker 1>so what you are arguing is against what </v>
<v Speaker 1>we already have in law,</v>

218
00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:23.433
<v Speaker 1>your reference to the criminality to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the sections of the criminal code at </v>

219
00:12:30.251 --> 00:12:31.084
<v Speaker 1>our last meeting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>senators wow correctly pointed out that </v>

220
00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:38.380
<v Speaker 1>sections three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>18 and slash 19</v>

221
00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:44.380
<v Speaker 1>starts off by genocide</v>
<v Speaker 1>under the heading genocide.</v>

222
00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:50.220
<v Speaker 1>The next heading is a public incitement </v>
<v Speaker 1>likely to lead to a breach of the peace.</v>

223
00:12:52.481 --> 00:12:54.790
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a breach of the peace is,</v>

224
00:12:54.791 --> 00:12:59.530
<v Speaker 1>Mr Brown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>willful promotion of hatred.</v>

225
00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:02.343
<v Speaker 1>These things are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there are defenses listed as </v>

226
00:13:05.561 --> 00:13:07.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that criminal code provision,</v>

227
00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:11.050
<v Speaker 1>there are several defense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you honestly believe in what you said</v>

228
00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:12.370
<v Speaker 1>is if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

229
00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:13.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

230
00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:15.910
<v Speaker 1>the defenses are extensive in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>criminal code,</v>

231
00:13:15.911 --> 00:13:18.460
<v Speaker 1>they've worked well for Canada.</v>

232
00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:20.883
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

233
00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:27.340
<v Speaker 1>what do you have to say about the facts </v>
<v Speaker 1>of what's presently in the criminal code</v>

234
00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:31.920
<v Speaker 1>and your reflection that somehow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

235
00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:33.033
<v Speaker 1>the genocide heading,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the heading on public incitement on </v>

236
00:13:37.301 --> 00:13:38.134
<v Speaker 1>willful promotion of hatred somehow that</v>
<v Speaker 1>these provisions should not be included </v>

237
00:13:42.791 --> 00:13:43.750
<v Speaker 1>under those headings?</v>

238
00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:45.903
<v Speaker 3>I think I have to be clear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my presentation relates to the </v>

239
00:13:47.351 --> 00:13:50.170
<v Speaker 3>amendments of the human rights code or </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Criminal Code,</v>

240
00:13:50.171 --> 00:13:51.004
<v Speaker 3>and that is in fact how a one like Dr </v>
<v Speaker 3>Peterson may in fact find themselves on </v>

241
00:13:55.031 --> 00:13:57.790
<v Speaker 3>the wrong side of jail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so if you have,</v>

242
00:13:57.850 --> 00:13:59.200
<v Speaker 3>if you've reviewed the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

243
00:13:59.201 --> 00:14:04.201
<v Speaker 3>the publication in the opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say that a simply by breaching the,</v>

244
00:14:04.931 --> 00:14:08.560
<v Speaker 3>a proposed amendment to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

245
00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:10.710
<v Speaker 3>to the human rights act,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

246
00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:15.100
<v Speaker 3>and particularly with somebody who is </v>
<v Speaker 3>deliberately doing so for instance,</v>

247
00:14:15.101 --> 00:14:17.530
<v Speaker 3>somebody was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to use those words,</v>

248
00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:21.550
<v Speaker 3>that person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they are dragged before the tribunal,</v>

249
00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:24.490
<v Speaker 3>the Ontario Tribune or the federal </v>
<v Speaker 3>tribunal,</v>

250
00:14:24.491 --> 00:14:25.324
<v Speaker 3>I've indicated to you already that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Department of Justice has said they're </v>

251
00:14:27.911 --> 00:14:30.400
<v Speaker 3>going to pass the same guideline on </v>
<v Speaker 3>pronouns.</v>

252
00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:35.350
<v Speaker 3>And so what I'm suggesting to you is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that if somebody says,</v>

253
00:14:35.351 --> 00:14:38.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to use those words are </v>
<v Speaker 3>brought before the tribunal,</v>

254
00:14:38.621 --> 00:14:39.454
<v Speaker 3>the Federal Tribunal and the tribunal </v>
<v Speaker 3>then delivers an order for payment of a </v>

255
00:14:44.051 --> 00:14:44.590
<v Speaker 3>fine.</v>

256
00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:48.120
<v Speaker 3>And alternatively a nonmonetary remedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

257
00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.800
<v Speaker 3>he cease and desist order,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

258
00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:53.540
<v Speaker 3>an order to do something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to compel them to do something.</v>

259
00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:56.090
<v Speaker 3>And that person who's brought before the</v>
<v Speaker 3>tribunal says,</v>

260
00:14:56.091 --> 00:14:59.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm not doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They will find themselves in contempt of</v>

261
00:14:59.541 --> 00:15:00.374
<v Speaker 3>court and prison is the likely outcome </v>
<v Speaker 3>of that process until they purge the </v>

262
00:15:05.481 --> 00:15:07.160
<v Speaker 3>content.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm suggesting.</v>

263
00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:09.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm not suggesting to you that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

264
00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:10.670
<v Speaker 3>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

265
00:15:10.671 --> 00:15:12.830
<v Speaker 3>amendments to the criminal code,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

266
00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:16.580
<v Speaker 3>well I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not advocating genocide.</v>

267
00:15:16.581 --> 00:15:18.180
<v Speaker 3>I guess let's just say that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And My,</v>

268
00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:19.043
<v Speaker 3>my presentation here is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is restricted to what I see as the </v>

269
00:15:21.621 --> 00:15:23.870
<v Speaker 3>Pronoun policy issue in the compelled </v>
<v Speaker 3>speech issue.</v>

270
00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:24.973
<v Speaker 3>So it covers the provincial legislation </v>
<v Speaker 3>if you distraught to disagree with that </v>

271
00:15:28.311 --> 00:15:31.910
<v Speaker 3>we've had in place in the provinces for </v>
<v Speaker 3>decades in some cases,</v>

272
00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:32.873
<v Speaker 3>is the policies that were enacted after </v>
<v Speaker 3>it left the legislature and which will </v>

273
00:15:36.261 --> 00:15:38.760
<v Speaker 3>be enacted after this bill leaves this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

274
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:39.703
<v Speaker 3>this committee.</v>

275
00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:41.043
<v Speaker 2>I would also like to add to that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fact that once I made the video stating </v>

276
00:15:45.461 --> 00:15:48.790
<v Speaker 2>that I wouldn't use the Z and Zer </v>
<v Speaker 2>pronouns,</v>

277
00:15:48.791 --> 00:15:49.624
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I regard as part of the </v>

278
00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:52.263
<v Speaker 2>ideological linguistic vanguard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the university lawyers after carefully </v>

279
00:15:56.021 --> 00:15:56.854
<v Speaker 2>considering what I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sent me two letters to cease and desist </v>

280
00:15:59.321 --> 00:16:00.154
<v Speaker 2>in my public utterances because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>believed that not only was I violating </v>

281
00:16:02.861 --> 00:16:03.694
<v Speaker 2>the university standards of conduct,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then I was also violating the </v>

282
00:16:06.041 --> 00:16:08.710
<v Speaker 2>relevant provisions of the Ontario Human</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rights Commission.</v>

283
00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:10.750
<v Speaker 2>Therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as I could tell,</v>

284
00:16:10.751 --> 00:16:14.320
<v Speaker 2>vindicating the statement that I made </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I made the video to begin with,</v>

285
00:16:14.321 --> 00:16:15.154
<v Speaker 2>which was that the act of making the </v>
<v Speaker 2>video itself was probably already </v>

286
00:16:18.281 --> 00:16:22.300
<v Speaker 2>illegal and they didn't do that lightly </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the provincial.</v>

287
00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:24.620
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Senator to put.</v>

288
00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:29.500
<v Speaker 5>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Chair and thank you gentlemen.</v>

289
00:16:29.501 --> 00:16:32.080
<v Speaker 5>Both of you for being here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

290
00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:37.600
<v Speaker 5>two questions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One for Dr Peterson at the get go.</v>

291
00:16:37.601 --> 00:16:38.434
<v Speaker 5>And then one for the two of you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hopefully the chair will indulge me a </v>

292
00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:48.280
<v Speaker 5>deliberations of this bill.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And during deliberations of this bill,</v>

293
00:16:48.281 --> 00:16:49.114
<v Speaker 5>we keep hearing the term respect,</v>
<v Speaker 5>throwing around respect as indeed </v>

294
00:16:53.651 --> 00:16:57.580
<v Speaker 5>critical in debates of legislation as </v>
<v Speaker 5>sensitive as this.</v>

295
00:16:57.581 --> 00:16:58.414
<v Speaker 5>And there are a lot of people here who </v>
<v Speaker 5>need to be reminded that respect works </v>

296
00:17:02.351 --> 00:17:04.960
<v Speaker 5>both ways,</v>
<v Speaker 5>including people at this committee.</v>

297
00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:06.790
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dr Baker,</v>

298
00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:10.810
<v Speaker 5>Senator Baker has already referred to </v>
<v Speaker 5>comments as genocide.</v>

299
00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:13.840
<v Speaker 5>I don't think anybody here is promoting </v>
<v Speaker 5>genocide.</v>

300
00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:16.030
<v Speaker 5>However,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dr. Peterson,</v>

301
00:17:16.031 --> 00:17:20.920
<v Speaker 5>can you comment on the notion of respect</v>
<v Speaker 5>where some of your critics say,</v>

302
00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:24.250
<v Speaker 5>why can you not just respect your </v>
<v Speaker 5>students,</v>

303
00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:28.690
<v Speaker 5>just use the gender neutral pronouns?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How do you respond to that?</v>

304
00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:30.121
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

305
00:17:30.121 --> 00:17:33.150
<v Speaker 2>I'd have to be convinced that doing so </v>
<v Speaker 2>would do more good than harm.</v>

306
00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:37.040
<v Speaker 2>And I don't believe that and I think I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually in a reasonable position to,</v>

307
00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:39.450
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to justify my claim.</v>

308
00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:40.313
<v Speaker 2>I think that the danger that's intrinsic</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the law far outweighs whatever </v>

309
00:17:44.011 --> 00:17:44.844
<v Speaker 2>potential benefit it might produce.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially given that there's no hard </v>

310
00:17:47.551 --> 00:17:48.384
<v Speaker 2>evidence whatsoever for any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would also like to point out that the </v>

311
00:17:52.021 --> 00:17:52.854
<v Speaker 2>people who are promoting this </v>
<v Speaker 2>legislation claim to be acting on the </v>

312
00:17:55.771 --> 00:17:58.410
<v Speaker 2>behalf behalf say of the transgender </v>
<v Speaker 2>community,</v>

313
00:17:58.411 --> 00:18:02.550
<v Speaker 2>but they weren't not elected nor </v>
<v Speaker 2>appointed to act as such representatives</v>

314
00:18:02.551 --> 00:18:03.820
<v Speaker 2>and they're doing it on their own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say.</v>

315
00:18:03.821 --> 00:18:05.220
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've received many letters,</v>

316
00:18:05.221 --> 00:18:09.820
<v Speaker 2>at least 30 now from transgendered </v>
<v Speaker 2>individuals indicating that the,</v>

317
00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:10.733
<v Speaker 2>they are not in accordance with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>claims of these so called </v>

318
00:18:13.651 --> 00:18:17.640
<v Speaker 2>representatives to be representing or </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the intent of the legislation,</v>

319
00:18:17.641 --> 00:18:20.460
<v Speaker 2>which has actually made them more </v>
<v Speaker 2>visible rather than less visible,</v>

320
00:18:20.461 --> 00:18:20.860
<v Speaker 2>which is.</v>

321
00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:21.693
<v Speaker 2>And the less visible is what they had </v>
<v Speaker 2>preferred with regards to respect is </v>

322
00:18:25.051 --> 00:18:30.051
<v Speaker 2>that you don't meet people generally </v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking in a mutual display of respect.</v>

323
00:18:30.931 --> 00:18:35.931
<v Speaker 2>You generally meet people in a mutual </v>
<v Speaker 2>display of alert neutrality,</v>

324
00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:39.870
<v Speaker 2>which is the appropriate way to begin an</v>
<v Speaker 2>interaction with someone because respect</v>

325
00:18:39.871 --> 00:18:40.704
<v Speaker 2>is something that you earn as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequence of reciprocal interactions </v>

326
00:18:44.251 --> 00:18:47.550
<v Speaker 2>with wwe that are dependent on something</v>
<v Speaker 2>like reputation,</v>

327
00:18:47.551 --> 00:18:50.310
<v Speaker 2>which is also a consequence of repeated </v>
<v Speaker 2>interactions.</v>

328
00:18:50.311 --> 00:18:53.790
<v Speaker 2>And so the notion that addressing </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone by their,</v>

329
00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:55.073
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>self-defined self identity isn't </v>

330
00:18:56.611 --> 00:18:59.880
<v Speaker 2>necessarily an indication of basic human</v>
<v Speaker 2>respect for them,</v>

331
00:18:59.881 --> 00:19:00.714
<v Speaker 2>I think is entirely spurious argument,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially given that there's no </v>

332
00:19:03.331 --> 00:19:04.164
<v Speaker 2>evidence that moving the language in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>compelling manner in this direction is </v>

333
00:19:07.621 --> 00:19:08.454
<v Speaker 2>going to have any beneficial effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're supposed to assume that just </v>

334
00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:14.310
<v Speaker 2>because hypothetically the intent is </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive,</v>

335
00:19:14.311 --> 00:19:15.144
<v Speaker 2>that the outcome will be positive and </v>
<v Speaker 2>any social scientist worth his or her </v>

336
00:19:17.941 --> 00:19:22.050
<v Speaker 2>salt knows perfectly well that that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>rarely the case.</v>

337
00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:23.093
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

338
00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:24.760
<v Speaker 5>Dr Brown,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

339
00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:27.850
<v Speaker 5>you've talked about a nonmonetary </v>
<v Speaker 5>orders,</v>

340
00:19:27.851 --> 00:19:30.220
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that could include sanctions like orders</v>

341
00:19:30.221 --> 00:19:32.920
<v Speaker 5>to undertake sensitivity and anti bias </v>
<v Speaker 5>training.</v>

342
00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:35.133
<v Speaker 5>I would like a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>either one or both of you to comment on </v>

343
00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:39.183
<v Speaker 5>whether you could explain why an </v>
<v Speaker 5>individual may have a strong objection </v>

344
00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:45.880
<v Speaker 5>to undertaking such a training.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And Mr Brown,</v>

345
00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:48.550
<v Speaker 5>could you let the committee know how </v>
<v Speaker 5>serious the sanction could be?</v>

346
00:19:48.551 --> 00:19:50.770
<v Speaker 5>An of course you already dead on that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

347
00:19:50.771 --> 00:19:52.780
<v Speaker 5>if you refuse to undertake such an </v>
<v Speaker 5>order,</v>

348
00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:55.270
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and specifically at the federal level,</v>

349
00:19:55.271 --> 00:19:56.290
<v Speaker 5>but what would,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what would,</v>

350
00:19:56.291 --> 00:19:58.770
<v Speaker 5>why would people have an objection to </v>
<v Speaker 5>taking such training?</v>

351
00:19:58.830 --> 00:19:59.663
<v Speaker 5>I think I'm going to let Dr Peterson </v>
<v Speaker 5>answer why he or someone like him might </v>

352
00:20:02.291 --> 00:20:04.880
<v Speaker 5>have an objection to undertaking that </v>
<v Speaker 5>type of training.</v>

353
00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:06.233
<v Speaker 5>Obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 5>once again with the severity of that </v>

354
00:20:08.411 --> 00:20:10.120
<v Speaker 5>decision.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If it gets before the tribunal,</v>

355
00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:13.600
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a profound objection to,</v>

356
00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:15.430
<v Speaker 2>to undergoing such training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

357
00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:18.970
<v Speaker 2>I would flatly refuse under all </v>
<v Speaker 2>conditions to undergo it.</v>

358
00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:21.250
<v Speaker 2>And the reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's multiple reasons for that.</v>

359
00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:24.970
<v Speaker 2>The first reason is that the science </v>
<v Speaker 2>surrounding the,</v>

360
00:20:24.971 --> 00:20:25.804
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the so called charge of implicit bias </v>

361
00:20:28.211 --> 00:20:31.470
<v Speaker 2>that's associated with perception is by </v>
<v Speaker 2>no means settled in,</v>

362
00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:32.613
<v Speaker 2>in to such a degree that to one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>three people who designed the most </v>

363
00:20:36.311 --> 00:20:39.640
<v Speaker 2>commonly used measure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the implicit association test,</v>

364
00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:40.563
<v Speaker 2>has detached himself from the other two </v>
<v Speaker 2>researchers on the grounds that the use </v>

365
00:20:44.681 --> 00:20:45.514
<v Speaker 2>of the test has become,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has far its scientific validity and </v>

366
00:20:49.211 --> 00:20:50.044
<v Speaker 2>reliability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's nowhere near valid or reliable </v>

367
00:20:51.911 --> 00:20:54.130
<v Speaker 2>enough to be used in the manner that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been using.</v>

368
00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:55.143
<v Speaker 2>And even the more a pro iat researchers </v>
<v Speaker 2>who developed the test have admitted to </v>

369
00:21:00.041 --> 00:21:00.874
<v Speaker 2>that publicly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though they haven't stressed it </v>

370
00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:03.160
<v Speaker 2>nearly to the degree they showed up.</v>

371
00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:06.910
<v Speaker 2>So first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sciences is not settled and is being</v>

372
00:21:06.911 --> 00:21:07.744
<v Speaker 2>used absolutely inappropriately and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>can say that as a clinician because I </v>

373
00:21:11.051 --> 00:21:15.280
<v Speaker 2>know that and as a psychometrician I </v>
<v Speaker 2>know the criteria for using a test for a</v>

374
00:21:15.281 --> 00:21:16.114
<v Speaker 2>six essentially diagnostic purposes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the iat doesn't even come close to </v>

375
00:21:19.121 --> 00:21:21.610
<v Speaker 2>what's necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the next issue is,</v>

376
00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:22.803
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where's the evidence that an anti </v>

377
00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:25.383
<v Speaker 2>unconscious bias training works?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no evidence and what little </v>

378
00:21:28.151 --> 00:21:31.270
<v Speaker 2>evidence there is suggests that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually has the opposite effect because</v>

379
00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:32.313
<v Speaker 2>people don't like being brought in front</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a reeducation committee and having </v>

380
00:21:35.681 --> 00:21:38.740
<v Speaker 2>their fundamental perceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see their perceptions,</v>

381
00:21:38.741 --> 00:21:42.040
<v Speaker 2>not even their thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but their perceptions themselves altered</v>

382
00:21:42.041 --> 00:21:45.100
<v Speaker 2>by collective Fiat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an unbelievable honor sir.</v>

383
00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:46.623
<v Speaker 2>We have a very engaged committee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>concise questions and concise responses </v>

384
00:21:49.631 --> 00:21:50.790
<v Speaker 2>with the helpful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

385
00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:51.633
<v Speaker 2>senator prep.</v>

386
00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:58.830
<v Speaker 6>Thank you for being here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I want to briefly for the documents from</v>

387
00:21:58.831 --> 00:21:59.664
<v Speaker 6>the Ontario Human Rights Commission says</v>
<v Speaker 6>some people may not know how to </v>

388
00:22:03.181 --> 00:22:04.014
<v Speaker 6>determine what Pronoun to use.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Others may feel uncomfortable using </v>

389
00:22:06.961 --> 00:22:08.670
<v Speaker 6>gender neutral pronouns.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Generally.</v>

390
00:22:08.671 --> 00:22:09.504
<v Speaker 6>When in doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 6>ask a person how they wish to be </v>

391
00:22:10.621 --> 00:22:13.590
<v Speaker 6>addressed Tuesday.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you don't know which Pronoun to use,</v>

392
00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:14.443
<v Speaker 6>his preferred,</v>
<v Speaker 6>simply referring to their person by </v>

393
00:22:16.381 --> 00:22:19.590
<v Speaker 6>their chosen name is always a respectful</v>
<v Speaker 6>approach.</v>

394
00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:22.740
<v Speaker 6>So you can use the pronoun,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can choose,</v>

395
00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:27.770
<v Speaker 6>you can use their chosen name.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So if someone chooses to change his name</v>

396
00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:29.453
<v Speaker 6>from Paul to Peter,</v>
<v Speaker 6>surely you'd use Peter because it's a </v>

397
00:22:32.491 --> 00:22:33.324
<v Speaker 6>matter of simple politeness and respect.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If that same person is the person </v>

398
00:22:37.051 --> 00:22:40.320
<v Speaker 6>chooses to cheat,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to change our name from Paul to Paula,</v>

399
00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:42.270
<v Speaker 6>won't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I won't use you.</v>

400
00:22:42.271 --> 00:22:45.300
<v Speaker 6>Use the name Polo simply as a matter of </v>
<v Speaker 6>respect.</v>

401
00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:47.580
<v Speaker 6>What's the difference here?</v>

402
00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:48.653
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guess the issue with that and the </v>

403
00:22:49.290 --> 00:22:50.123
<v Speaker 6>speaker about the legal issue there is </v>
<v Speaker 6>that you're now introducing the full </v>

404
00:22:52.081 --> 00:22:54.570
<v Speaker 6>force of the law behind the requirement </v>
<v Speaker 6>to use.</v>

405
00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:55.763
<v Speaker 6>And I'm dealing obviously with,</v>
<v Speaker 6>with respect to the pronoun issue in </v>

406
00:22:58.051 --> 00:22:59.820
<v Speaker 6>terms of not addressing somebody by </v>
<v Speaker 6>their,</v>

407
00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:02.460
<v Speaker 6>by their legally registered name,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for instance.</v>

408
00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:04.200
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

409
00:23:04.201 --> 00:23:06.750
<v Speaker 6>I don't think that's where we're running</v>
<v Speaker 6>into trouble here.</v>

410
00:23:06.751 --> 00:23:10.650
<v Speaker 6>I think the issue becomes that if you </v>
<v Speaker 6>don't address somebody by the,</v>

411
00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:11.543
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the pronoun that they self identify by </v>

412
00:23:13.171 --> 00:23:18.120
<v Speaker 6>as I've read out to you the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 6>the full force of the law will be behind</v>

413
00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:21.030
<v Speaker 6>a that person.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm that that's what I,</v>

414
00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:24.210
<v Speaker 6>I'm a finding as trump,</v>
<v Speaker 6>troubling in the legislation,</v>

415
00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:25.253
<v Speaker 6>but the Ontario Human Rights Commission </v>
<v Speaker 6>gives people the alternative not to use </v>

416
00:23:29.701 --> 00:23:33.360
<v Speaker 6>pronouns and use the person's chosen </v>
<v Speaker 6>name it,</v>

417
00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:34.253
<v Speaker 6>which is always a respectful approach.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So pronouns are not necessary or not </v>

418
00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:38.700
<v Speaker 6>mandatory.</v>

419
00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:43.080
<v Speaker 6>You can always choose the person's </v>
<v Speaker 6>chosen name as a respectful approach.</v>

420
00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:47.270
<v Speaker 6>And therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not aware that anybody,</v>

421
00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:48.770
<v Speaker 6>that there is a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

422
00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:52.760
<v Speaker 6>a piece of legislation that compels you </v>
<v Speaker 6>to use my proper name.</v>

423
00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:55.670
<v Speaker 6>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 6>once again,</v>

424
00:23:55.671 --> 00:23:59.930
<v Speaker 6>it's the fact that the full force of the</v>
<v Speaker 6>law will be behind it when we're dealing</v>

425
00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:02.750
<v Speaker 6>with the group being identified in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>legislation.</v>

426
00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:03.980
<v Speaker 6>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for instance,</v>

427
00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:06.110
<v Speaker 6>I were not to call you by your chosen </v>
<v Speaker 6>name.</v>

428
00:24:06.111 --> 00:24:09.620
<v Speaker 6>I'm not sure you'd enjoy the full force </v>
<v Speaker 6>of law behind you.</v>

429
00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:10.740
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

430
00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:13.250
<v Speaker 6>as a result of that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's what I'm suggesting to you is</v>

431
00:24:13.251 --> 00:24:14.490
<v Speaker 6>the difference here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm just sorry.</v>

432
00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:15.383
<v Speaker 6>When you said that you always base </v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever you say on what the Ontario </v>

433
00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:19.873
<v Speaker 6>Human Rights Commission is saying,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I'm quoting from the Ontario Human </v>

434
00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:23.233
<v Speaker 6>Rights Commission document.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're saying we're not mandated </v>

435
00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:26.593
<v Speaker 6>mandating pronouns.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can always use the person's chosen </v>

436
00:24:29.511 --> 00:24:32.690
<v Speaker 6>name as a respectful approach.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I respectfully disagree,</v>

437
00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:35.560
<v Speaker 2>but then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I would say then that's actually an</v>

438
00:24:35.561 --> 00:24:39.790
<v Speaker 2>indication of just exactly how important</v>
<v Speaker 2>the policy documents are written because</v>

439
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.540
<v Speaker 2>I can quote this one which which is also</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the Ontario Human Rights Commission</v>

440
00:24:43.541 --> 00:24:45.460
<v Speaker 2>website that says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I quote,</v>

441
00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:46.503
<v Speaker 2>refusing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>refusing to refer to a person by their </v>

442
00:24:47.981 --> 00:24:51.010
<v Speaker 2>self identified name and proper </v>
<v Speaker 2>personal,</v>

443
00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:52.713
<v Speaker 2>proper personal pronouns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Counts constitutes gender based </v>

444
00:24:55.001 --> 00:24:56.920
<v Speaker 2>harassment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if there.</v>

445
00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:57.933
<v Speaker 2>If the policies are written in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>coherent manner and there wasn't </v>

446
00:24:59.891 --> 00:25:00.724
<v Speaker 2>internal contradictions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then your statement would be a </v>

447
00:25:02.351 --> 00:25:04.930
<v Speaker 2>reasonable objection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But since it's not written that way,</v>

448
00:25:04.931 --> 00:25:07.830
<v Speaker 2>and I do believe firmly that that's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>testament to the.</v>

449
00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:11.500
<v Speaker 2>To the degree to which it's supporting </v>
<v Speaker 2>written set of policies,</v>

450
00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:13.870
<v Speaker 2>is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's full of internal contradictions and</v>

451
00:25:13.871 --> 00:25:14.704
<v Speaker 2>that'll be worked out very painfully </v>
<v Speaker 2>within the confines of people's private </v>

452
00:25:17.471 --> 00:25:18.304
<v Speaker 2>lives.</v>

453
00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:20.660
<v Speaker 7>Thank you sir.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Good.</v>

454
00:25:20.661 --> 00:25:21.830
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>senator batters.</v>

455
00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:25.070
<v Speaker 7>Thanks very much.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Both of you for being here.</v>

456
00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:27.320
<v Speaker 7>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Dr Peterson.</v>

457
00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:28.573
<v Speaker 7>I want to go back to this issue of </v>
<v Speaker 7>personal pronouns and if you could </v>

458
00:25:30.651 --> 00:25:32.750
<v Speaker 7>please tell our committee more about </v>
<v Speaker 7>this issue.</v>

459
00:25:32.751 --> 00:25:35.990
<v Speaker 7>It's something that I was not at all </v>
<v Speaker 7>familiar with prior to this bill</v>

460
00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:39.133
<v Speaker 7>being introduced and in particular about</v>
<v Speaker 7>the gender neutral pronouns and your </v>

461
00:25:42.801 --> 00:25:43.634
<v Speaker 7>experience in pushing back against being</v>
<v Speaker 7>forced to use those general neutral </v>

462
00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:48.530
<v Speaker 7>gender neutral pronouns.</v>

463
00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:49.843
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think the people who initiated </v>

464
00:25:51.501 --> 00:25:52.334
<v Speaker 2>this legislation ever expected that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there would be an absolute explosion of </v>

465
00:25:56.050 --> 00:25:57.950
<v Speaker 2>of identities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

466
00:25:57.951 --> 00:26:01.370
<v Speaker 2>and also so-called personal pronouns as </v>
<v Speaker 2>there has been.</v>

467
00:26:01.371 --> 00:26:02.204
<v Speaker 2>I think facebook now recognize as </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like 71 separate gender </v>

468
00:26:05.361 --> 00:26:08.720
<v Speaker 2>identity categories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>each of which in principle is associated</v>

469
00:26:08.721 --> 00:26:13.070
<v Speaker 2>with its own set of pronouns and so it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>become what linguistically and it's.</v>

470
00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:14.143
<v Speaker 2>It's become a parody essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's become linguistically unmanageable </v>

471
00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.500
<v Speaker 2>and it's also the case that words can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>be introduced into the language by Fiat.</v>

472
00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:23.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't even think of a time when that's</v>

473
00:26:23.841 --> 00:26:24.674
<v Speaker 2>actually work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not exactly sure how words enter </v>

474
00:26:26.221 --> 00:26:28.550
<v Speaker 2>the common parlance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's certainly not that way.</v>

475
00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:31.190
<v Speaker 2>And so the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

476
00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:33.810
<v Speaker 2>the legislation devolves into a kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

477
00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:36.380
<v Speaker 2>of the absurdity as far as I can tell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

478
00:26:36.381 --> 00:26:37.214
<v Speaker 2>one of the people that I discussed this </v>
<v Speaker 2>with claim that the way that you kept </v>

479
00:26:39.831 --> 00:26:40.664
<v Speaker 2>track of someone's personal pronouns was</v>
<v Speaker 2>to use your cell phone as an adjunct to </v>

480
00:26:44.671 --> 00:26:46.830
<v Speaker 2>your communication.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean that's,</v>

481
00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:50.880
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't say anything like that if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you knew anything about</v>

482
00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:53.273
<v Speaker 2>common human nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say in the matter in which people </v>

483
00:26:55.261 --> 00:26:57.140
<v Speaker 2>communicate with one another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

484
00:26:57.460 --> 00:26:59.860
<v Speaker 7>the types of pronouns are talking about </v>
<v Speaker 7>just so everyone's clear,</v>

485
00:26:59.861 --> 00:27:02.170
<v Speaker 7>because I don't think these are common </v>
<v Speaker 7>common parlance,</v>

486
00:27:02.171 --> 00:27:03.004
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>ze Zer and what other sorts of gender </v>

487
00:27:05.501 --> 00:27:07.240
<v Speaker 7>neutral pronouns are we discussing?</v>

488
00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:08.393
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have very bad memory for that sort of </v>

489
00:27:10.021 --> 00:27:11.730
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you're interested in that,</v>

490
00:27:11.731 --> 00:27:16.170
<v Speaker 2>you can find lists of them very rapidly </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the web and they'd been produced by,</v>

491
00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:17.243
<v Speaker 2>I think they'd been produced by people </v>
<v Speaker 2>whose essential desire is to gain </v>

492
00:27:22.111 --> 00:27:25.160
<v Speaker 2>linguistic control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

493
00:27:25.270 --> 00:27:26.103
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's as simple as I can put it is to </v>

494
00:27:27.361 --> 00:27:31.550
<v Speaker 2>gain linguistic control,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're not used popularly and,</v>

495
00:27:31.570 --> 00:27:32.403
<v Speaker 2>and that seems to me to be a real </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem as a consequence that you make </v>

496
00:27:36.361 --> 00:27:40.470
<v Speaker 2>failure to make their use something that</v>
<v Speaker 2>could carry a criminal penalty.</v>

497
00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:41.753
<v Speaker 2>So I just don't understand that and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't understand how the </v>

498
00:27:44.461 --> 00:27:45.294
<v Speaker 2>government can justify imposing a </v>
<v Speaker 2>criminal penalty on the use of words </v>

499
00:27:48.511 --> 00:27:53.250
<v Speaker 2>that no one either knows or uses it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just seems preposterous to me.</v>

500
00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:55.050
<v Speaker 2>But there it is.</v>

501
00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:57.850
<v Speaker 7>Could you please also tell us a little </v>
<v Speaker 7>bit more about the,</v>

502
00:27:58.050 --> 00:28:00.660
<v Speaker 7>your personal experience in pushing back</v>
<v Speaker 7>against this?</v>

503
00:28:00.661 --> 00:28:03.880
<v Speaker 7>And I mean many are familiar with your </v>
<v Speaker 7>story but not everyone.</v>

504
00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:05.010
<v Speaker 7>So I just want to give you a little.</v>

505
00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:06.330
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I made a video,</v>

506
00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:09.630
<v Speaker 2>actually made three videos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we'll just talk about one of them.</v>

507
00:28:09.631 --> 00:28:10.464
<v Speaker 2>I thought I made one criticizing bill c </v>
<v Speaker 2>16 for the reasons that I already </v>

508
00:28:13.891 --> 00:28:17.500
<v Speaker 2>described because I went and read the </v>
<v Speaker 2>policies and I made my hair stand on end</v>

509
00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:19.730
<v Speaker 2>to the surrounding policies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

510
00:28:19.731 --> 00:28:20.564
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I made a video stating essentially </v>

511
00:28:22.951 --> 00:28:26.070
<v Speaker 2>that and detailed out my reasons and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

512
00:28:26.071 --> 00:28:29.130
<v Speaker 2>I've been following the battle of let's </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

513
00:28:29.131 --> 00:28:33.090
<v Speaker 2>ideologies on campus for a very long </v>
<v Speaker 2>period of time and I suppose I have some</v>

514
00:28:33.091 --> 00:28:33.924
<v Speaker 2>expertise in that and there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an ideological war that's </v>

515
00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:40.730
<v Speaker 2>ripping a campuses apart and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially between a,</v>

516
00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:45.690
<v Speaker 2>an ideological variant that's rooted in </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's come to be known as postmodernism</v>

517
00:28:45.691 --> 00:28:50.691
<v Speaker 2>with kind of the Neo Marxist base and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and modern modernism.</v>

518
00:28:51.751 --> 00:28:55.230
<v Speaker 2>I would say that that's accounting for </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the turmoil on campuses.</v>

519
00:28:55.231 --> 00:28:58.950
<v Speaker 2>And I see this as an extension of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>campus turmoil into the broader world.</v>

520
00:28:58.950 --> 00:28:59.783
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I really believe that is the proper </v>

521
00:29:00.991 --> 00:29:02.970
<v Speaker 2>level of analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I truly believe that.</v>

522
00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:07.140
<v Speaker 2>And so I said that I believe that this </v>
<v Speaker 2>is the V,</v>

523
00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:08.023
<v Speaker 2>a vanguard issue in a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideological war and that I'm not going </v>

524
00:29:11.221 --> 00:29:13.500
<v Speaker 2>to participate on the side of the people</v>
<v Speaker 2>whose,</v>

525
00:29:13.650 --> 00:29:16.740
<v Speaker 2>whose ideological stance I find </v>
<v Speaker 2>reprehensible,</v>

526
00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:20.460
<v Speaker 2>unforgivable and reprehensible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially the Marxist element of it.</v>

527
00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:21.863
<v Speaker 2>And so I announced that I was going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>use these words because I don't believe </v>

528
00:29:24.571 --> 00:29:26.940
<v Speaker 2>that they're instantiating to protect </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone's rights.</v>

529
00:29:26.941 --> 00:29:28.560
<v Speaker 2>I believe they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the,</v>

530
00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:29.693
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ideologues who are pushing this </v>

531
00:29:30.811 --> 00:29:31.644
<v Speaker 2>movement are using unsuspecting and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes complicit members of the so </v>

532
00:29:35.131 --> 00:29:39.570
<v Speaker 2>called transgender community to push </v>
<v Speaker 2>their ideological vanguard forward.</v>

533
00:29:39.571 --> 00:29:43.120
<v Speaker 2>And I firmly believe that so I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 2>participating in that.</v>

534
00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:44.373
<v Speaker 2>And the fact that it's potentially </v>
<v Speaker 2>illegal for me not to participate in </v>

535
00:29:47.231 --> 00:29:51.130
<v Speaker 2>that is something that I regard as.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's absolutely dreadful.</v>

536
00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:52.033
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes,</v>

537
00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:52.893
<v Speaker 2>it puts a shutter in my heart as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Canadian that we could even possibly be </v>

538
00:29:55.691 --> 00:29:57.940
<v Speaker 2>in a situation like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

539
00:29:57.941 --> 00:29:58.774
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the,</v>

540
00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:02.050
<v Speaker 2>if the identity claims that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>instantiated in this lead,</v>

541
00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:04.630
<v Speaker 2>in the policies surrounding this </v>
<v Speaker 2>legislation are applied,</v>

542
00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:06.610
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be held for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychiatrist,</v>

543
00:30:06.611 --> 00:30:07.444
<v Speaker 2>excuse my language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be very difficult for the </v>

544
00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:10.413
<v Speaker 2>biologists and the psychiatrists next.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think we'll see that happening </v>

545
00:30:13.601 --> 00:30:15.400
<v Speaker 2>very soon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you,</v>

546
00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:16.580
<v Speaker 2>Senator Gold.</v>

547
00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:19.540
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And thank you for being here.</v>

548
00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:22.290
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

549
00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:25.060
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm never been a practicing lawyer.</v>

550
00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:29.230
<v Speaker 1>I was a constitutional law professor and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a free speech guy.</v>

551
00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:30.943
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I appreciate the importance of the </v>

552
00:30:34.721 --> 00:30:35.554
<v Speaker 1>issues that are being raised.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think respectfully they were answered </v>

553
00:30:39.370 --> 00:30:42.430
<v Speaker 1>free speech issues were answered quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>compellingly by my former colleague,</v>

554
00:30:42.431 --> 00:30:45.610
<v Speaker 1>Brenda Cosmin and testimony before this </v>
<v Speaker 1>committee.</v>

555
00:30:45.611 --> 00:30:47.950
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to make three points,</v>

556
00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:49.190
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

557
00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:53.240
<v Speaker 1>Mr Peterson and there are questions sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of varied in this point.</v>

558
00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:55.743
<v Speaker 1>I think I heard you say that you thought</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the harm to this legislation </v>

559
00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:00.610
<v Speaker 1>outweighs the good but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

560
00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:01.863
<v Speaker 1>but there is the trans community suffers</v>
<v Speaker 1>harm regularly when they're </v>

561
00:31:04.871 --> 00:31:05.704
<v Speaker 1>discriminated against and whatever else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One might say and worry about human </v>

562
00:31:11.621 --> 00:31:12.454
<v Speaker 1>rights tribunals and the like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This bill addresses and would take a </v>

563
00:31:18.461 --> 00:31:20.560
<v Speaker 1>major step forward towards reducing </v>
<v Speaker 1>harm,</v>

564
00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:21.623
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are particularly vulnerable </v>

565
00:31:22.391 --> 00:31:25.090
<v Speaker 1>community experiences.</v>

566
00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:26.913
<v Speaker 1>Second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see if we could zero in on where </v>

567
00:31:28.391 --> 00:31:29.224
<v Speaker 1>we might agree that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is nothing in the law that </v>

568
00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:36.093
<v Speaker 1>criminalizes or creates a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an offense to criticize the notion that </v>

569
00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:42.393
<v Speaker 1>identity as a social construct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you do to criticize the way in </v>

570
00:31:45.491 --> 00:31:46.324
<v Speaker 1>which words come into the language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Modern Hebrews and example of where </v>

571
00:31:49.571 --> 00:31:51.850
<v Speaker 1>it's coming in by fee and the academy </v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

572
00:31:51.851 --> 00:31:55.300
<v Speaker 1>does it as well for Shakespeare gave us </v>
<v Speaker 1>so much of our language,</v>

573
00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:56.493
<v Speaker 1>but there's nothing in this bill that </v>
<v Speaker 1>stands in the way of you taking a </v>

574
00:32:00.041 --> 00:32:04.720
<v Speaker 1>principal position against all aspects </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this including your criticisms of the</v>

575
00:32:04.721 --> 00:32:07.810
<v Speaker 1>activist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the issue is the Pronoun.</v>

576
00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:10.120
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and unless I'm reading it wrong,</v>

577
00:32:10.990 --> 00:32:11.823
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Senator Pratte pointed out the Ontario </v>

578
00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:20.700
<v Speaker 1>Human Rights Commission policy does not </v>
<v Speaker 1>say that refusing to use a person's self</v>

579
00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:26.970
<v Speaker 1>identified name or personal pronoun does</v>
<v Speaker 1>Constitute Gender based harassment.</v>

580
00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:29.890
<v Speaker 1>I May,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I may be wrong,</v>

581
00:32:29.891 --> 00:32:33.190
<v Speaker 1>but I believe it said it could and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that's a real difference.</v>

582
00:32:33.191 --> 00:32:35.020
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I turn to you and say,</v>

583
00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:36.183
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please call me they because how I see </v>

584
00:32:40.371 --> 00:32:41.204
<v Speaker 1>myself now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's hurtful for you to call me </v>

585
00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:47.040
<v Speaker 1>sir,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or miss whatever,</v>

586
00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:50.960
<v Speaker 1>whatever it would be a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you refuse.</v>

587
00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:51.720
<v Speaker 1>And I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

588
00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:52.553
<v Speaker 1>Kate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're uncomfortable with that </v>

589
00:32:53.121 --> 00:32:55.910
<v Speaker 1>because you're not comfortable with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

590
00:32:55.970 --> 00:33:00.970
<v Speaker 1>call me mark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you refuse to continue to call me by</v>

591
00:33:01.731 --> 00:33:03.560
<v Speaker 1>the name that I'm telling you is perfect</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me.</v>

592
00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:09.620
<v Speaker 1>Is that not in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that,</v>

593
00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:17.950
<v Speaker 1>is that not something that the law can </v>
<v Speaker 1>properly address?</v>

594
00:33:17.951 --> 00:33:22.880
<v Speaker 1>This is you were knowingly hurting me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

595
00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:24.790
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in that respect,</v>

596
00:33:26.250 --> 00:33:30.790
<v Speaker 1>our courts ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think are capable of striking a proper</v>

597
00:33:30.791 --> 00:33:33.340
<v Speaker 1>balance between people who slip up or </v>
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

598
00:33:33.341 --> 00:33:34.174
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just can't get the words out of their </v>

599
00:33:36.131 --> 00:33:41.050
<v Speaker 1>mouth and those that persist and </v>
<v Speaker 1>intentionally causing it to respond.</v>

600
00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:44.080
<v Speaker 1>Would you agree with my characterization</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>

601
00:33:44.490 --> 00:33:45.323
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>free speech as it applies to these </v>

602
00:33:46.751 --> 00:33:47.561
<v Speaker 1>issues?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me jump in.</v>

603
00:33:47.561 --> 00:33:48.394
<v Speaker 1>Just on the legal point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after Dr Peterson posted these videos </v>

604
00:33:52.271 --> 00:33:53.104
<v Speaker 1>and after he ruins to the consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Ontario human rights commission </v>

605
00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:58.233
<v Speaker 1>deemed fit to release a new policy </v>
<v Speaker 1>document called questions and answers </v>

606
00:34:01.811 --> 00:34:04.360
<v Speaker 1>about gender identity and pronouns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in so doing,</v>

607
00:34:04.810 --> 00:34:08.400
<v Speaker 1>they said that refusing to refer to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>trans person by their chosen name and pr</v>

608
00:34:08.470 --> 00:34:09.303
<v Speaker 1>and a personal pronoun that matches </v>
<v Speaker 1>their gender identity or purposely </v>

609
00:34:12.371 --> 00:34:15.010
<v Speaker 1>misgendering will likely be </v>
<v Speaker 1>discrimination.</v>

610
00:34:15.010 --> 00:34:15.843
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain than what you may have a </v>

611
00:34:18.650 --> 00:34:21.200
<v Speaker 1>indicated in your comments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll love Dr. um,</v>

612
00:34:21.730 --> 00:34:23.920
<v Speaker 1>a and once again that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that policy was,</v>

613
00:34:23.950 --> 00:34:28.950
<v Speaker 1>was put out after Dr Peterson began to </v>
<v Speaker 1>speak on the issue and so I think that's</v>

614
00:34:30.431 --> 00:34:33.160
<v Speaker 1>very telling that it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a response if you will,</v>

615
00:34:33.161 --> 00:34:34.000
<v Speaker 1>to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

616
00:34:34.001 --> 00:34:36.220
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this issue that Dr Peterson raised.</v>

617
00:34:36.221 --> 00:34:37.054
<v Speaker 1>I going to know obviously Dr Pearson to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go ahead with the other element of your </v>

618
00:34:39.611 --> 00:34:41.480
<v Speaker 1>question very briefly sir.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

619
00:34:41.490 --> 00:34:42.323
<v Speaker 1>so I would say that the very idea that </v>
<v Speaker 1>calling someone a term that they didn't </v>

620
00:34:48.101 --> 00:34:53.101
<v Speaker 1>choose causes them such irreparable harm</v>
<v Speaker 1>that legal remedies should be sought.</v>

621
00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:54.893
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than regarding it as a form of </v>

622
00:34:56.321 --> 00:34:59.350
<v Speaker 1>impoliteness that legal remedies should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should be sought,</v>

623
00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:00.213
<v Speaker 1>including potential violation of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hate speech codes is an indication of </v>

624
00:35:03.761 --> 00:35:08.170
<v Speaker 1>just how deeply the culture of </v>
<v Speaker 1>victimization is sunk into our society.</v>

625
00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:10.690
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll leave it.</v>

626
00:35:10.691 --> 00:35:11.830
<v Speaker 1>There are a senator from</v>

627
00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:16.633
<v Speaker 7>same topic with Mr Brown at when the </v>
<v Speaker 7>Minister of Justice was before this </v>

628
00:35:20.721 --> 00:35:24.020
<v Speaker 7>committee.</v>
<v Speaker 7>She said the following,</v>

629
00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:25.393
<v Speaker 7>there is nothing within bill [inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 7>that would compel somebody to have to </v>

630
00:35:29.571 --> 00:35:30.404
<v Speaker 7>call somebody by the pronouns he or she </v>
<v Speaker 7>or otherwise can you comment on </v>

631
00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:38.000
<v Speaker 7>preposition?</v>
<v Speaker 7>But I'd</v>

632
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:40.470
<v Speaker 6>agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There is nothing in the bill,</v>

633
00:35:40.471 --> 00:35:42.390
<v Speaker 6>but the problem is that in the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

634
00:35:42.770 --> 00:35:45.570
<v Speaker 6>the government of Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Department of Justice website,</v>

635
00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:47.050
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

636
00:35:47.051 --> 00:35:49.260
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in their questions and answer section of</v>

637
00:35:49.261 --> 00:35:51.420
<v Speaker 6>their website which was pulled down in </v>
<v Speaker 6>December,</v>

638
00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:55.440
<v Speaker 6>it's that top five of my brief.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It makes very clear that the definitions</v>

639
00:35:55.441 --> 00:35:56.274
<v Speaker 6>of the terms gender identity and gender </v>
<v Speaker 6>expression have already been given by </v>

640
00:35:58.531 --> 00:35:59.364
<v Speaker 6>the Ontario Human Rights Commission.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The commission has provided helpful </v>

641
00:36:02.221 --> 00:36:05.070
<v Speaker 6>discussion and examples that can offer </v>
<v Speaker 6>good practical guidance.</v>

642
00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:05.933
<v Speaker 6>The Canadian Human Rights Commission </v>
<v Speaker 6>will provide similar guidance on the </v>

643
00:36:08.581 --> 00:36:10.740
<v Speaker 6>meaning of these terms in the Canadian </v>
<v Speaker 6>Human Rights Act.</v>

644
00:36:10.770 --> 00:36:14.580
<v Speaker 6>Now I take that to the legislative </v>
<v Speaker 6>intent and I'll agree with you that the,</v>

645
00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:15.443
<v Speaker 6>that the bill itself on its face does </v>
<v Speaker 6>not seem to imply any manner of </v>

646
00:36:17.431 --> 00:36:18.264
<v Speaker 6>compelled speech.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But when we're tying it so deliberately </v>

647
00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:22.950
<v Speaker 6>and with this expectation,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's where I think you get into a,</v>

648
00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:23.873
<v Speaker 6>into some trouble.</v>

649
00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:28.793
<v Speaker 6>Mr Barney,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he spoke about the chilling effects of </v>

650
00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:31.043
<v Speaker 6>overly broad accusation.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm wondering if you consider the terms </v>

651
00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:37.480
<v Speaker 6>gender identity and gender expression to</v>
<v Speaker 6>be equally,</v>

652
00:36:38.130 --> 00:36:42.340
<v Speaker 6>or do you consider one broader than the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

653
00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:47.940
<v Speaker 6>I think they are overly broad </v>
<v Speaker 6>definitions and,</v>

654
00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:48.863
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I think the only thing I can offer </v>

655
00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:53.380
<v Speaker 6>as a lawyer and a litigator is that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

656
00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:56.360
<v Speaker 6>the courts don't like overbroad terms </v>
<v Speaker 6>and I,</v>

657
00:36:56.361 --> 00:37:01.290
<v Speaker 6>and I would refer you to the decision of</v>
<v Speaker 6>a London boy Berto Court of Appeal,</v>

658
00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:02.513
<v Speaker 6>where in that case the court of appeals </v>
<v Speaker 6>is the objective of statutory </v>

659
00:37:05.101 --> 00:37:06.200
<v Speaker 6>interpretation is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>does,</v>

660
00:37:06.201 --> 00:37:07.034
<v Speaker 6>is to discern the legislative intent </v>
<v Speaker 6>from the language of the legislation if </v>

661
00:37:09.991 --> 00:37:12.660
<v Speaker 6>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And to give effect to such intent.</v>

662
00:37:13.050 --> 00:37:15.330
<v Speaker 6>This objective becomes difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 6>attain.</v>

663
00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:16.373
<v Speaker 6>Where there is conflict in precision or </v>
<v Speaker 6>a lack of clarity in the legislation of </v>

664
00:37:20.011 --> 00:37:20.844
<v Speaker 6>particularly of particular concern in </v>
<v Speaker 6>the area of human rights law is that a </v>

665
00:37:23.851 --> 00:37:26.830
<v Speaker 6>lack of clarity will cast a chill on the</v>
<v Speaker 6>exercise on the,</v>

666
00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:30.240
<v Speaker 6>of the fundamental freedoms such as </v>
<v Speaker 6>freedom of expression and religion.</v>

667
00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:31.500
<v Speaker 6>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

668
00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:32.603
<v Speaker 6>while I personally believe that the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that the terms are not properly or not </v>

669
00:37:35.281 --> 00:37:37.920
<v Speaker 6>clearly defined and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and somewhat ambiguous,</v>

670
00:37:38.370 --> 00:37:41.430
<v Speaker 6>the courts don't like that type of </v>
<v Speaker 6>legislation either,</v>

671
00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:44.750
<v Speaker 2>just to add two things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

672
00:37:44.930 --> 00:37:48.290
<v Speaker 2>with regards to the chill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's already the case and I've seen this</v>

673
00:37:48.291 --> 00:37:50.720
<v Speaker 2>among my own students when they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>teaching personality,</v>

674
00:37:50.721 --> 00:37:51.554
<v Speaker 2>which is what I teach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which also involves a assessment of </v>

675
00:37:53.961 --> 00:37:54.794
<v Speaker 2>gender differences between men and women</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the proclivity now is for the </v>

676
00:37:58.611 --> 00:37:59.444
<v Speaker 2>advanced phd students to avoid any such </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussions in their classrooms because </v>

677
00:38:02.481 --> 00:38:05.540
<v Speaker 2>of the potential cost of transgressing </v>
<v Speaker 2>against,</v>

678
00:38:05.541 --> 00:38:07.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an unknown norm,</v>

679
00:38:07.371 --> 00:38:10.370
<v Speaker 2>let's say is so high that it's just </v>
<v Speaker 2>easier to teach other things.</v>

680
00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:13.460
<v Speaker 2>And so I've seen that clearly and with </v>
<v Speaker 2>multiple people.</v>

681
00:38:13.461 --> 00:38:14.294
<v Speaker 2>And I would also say that it's no </v>
<v Speaker 2>trivial matter that the department of </v>

682
00:38:18.471 --> 00:38:19.304
<v Speaker 2>Justice's link to the Ontario Human </v>
<v Speaker 2>Rights Commission and their statements </v>

683
00:38:22.431 --> 00:38:23.264
<v Speaker 2>about how this legislation was going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be interpreted mysteriously disappeared </v>

684
00:38:26.181 --> 00:38:27.014
<v Speaker 2>in the middle of December.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of all the things that have happened to </v>

685
00:38:28.521 --> 00:38:32.510
<v Speaker 2>me happened in relationship to this ad </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I'd been studying.</v>

686
00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:35.680
<v Speaker 2>I think that was the most chilling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So because it was the,</v>

687
00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:36.543
<v Speaker 2>it was the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you say it was the smoking </v>

688
00:38:37.991 --> 00:38:38.800
<v Speaker 2>pistol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

689
00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:41.410
<v Speaker 2>Because the issue is what's the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>level of analysis?</v>

690
00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:43.300
<v Speaker 2>He just supposed to look at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>legislation.</v>

691
00:38:43.450 --> 00:38:46.000
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>since the Justice Department said no,</v>

692
00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:48.340
<v Speaker 2>you're supposed to look at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>surrounding policies.</v>

693
00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:50.860
<v Speaker 2>Well that's what I did and that's what I</v>
<v Speaker 2>based my case on.</v>

694
00:38:50.861 --> 00:38:52.660
<v Speaker 2>And then all of a sudden the link to </v>
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>

695
00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:53.863
<v Speaker 2>the link tying those two things together</v>
<v Speaker 2>just vanished and people had to go into </v>

696
00:38:56.741 --> 00:38:58.870
<v Speaker 2>the Internet archives to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

697
00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:02.560
<v Speaker 2>to fish it back out so that it could </v>
<v Speaker 2>remain part of the public record.</v>

698
00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:07.800
<v Speaker 2>I think that's absolutely scandalous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

699
00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:09.240
<v Speaker 2>Senator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm adver.</v>

700
00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:11.913
<v Speaker 4>Thank you chair.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And thank you both of you for being </v>

701
00:39:13.071 --> 00:39:14.270
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

702
00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:18.650
<v Speaker 4>I was trying to take notes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think I got this right of Peterson</v>

703
00:39:18.651 --> 00:39:23.651
<v Speaker 4>that you talked about this bill as being</v>
<v Speaker 4>an expression of vanguard of ideology.</v>

704
00:39:25.821 --> 00:39:27.590
<v Speaker 4>Am My,</v>
<v Speaker 4>am I right in thinking in,</v>

705
00:39:27.610 --> 00:39:27.850
<v Speaker 4>in?</v>

706
00:39:27.850 --> 00:39:28.683
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking more about the policies </v>

707
00:39:29.741 --> 00:39:31.750
<v Speaker 2>that surrounded it but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yes.</v>

708
00:39:31.770 --> 00:39:33.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm trying to.</v>

709
00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:38.680
<v Speaker 4>Where would you as a party of one are </v>
<v Speaker 4>saying that published documents from the</v>

710
00:39:40.471 --> 00:39:44.640
<v Speaker 4>Canadian psychological association,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the American Psychological Association,</v>

711
00:39:44.641 --> 00:39:49.350
<v Speaker 4>the Canadian Medical Association,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the American Psychiatric Association,</v>

712
00:39:49.351 --> 00:39:50.184
<v Speaker 4>the Canadian Psychiatry Association,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the United Nation human rights </v>

713
00:39:55.110 --> 00:39:57.090
<v Speaker 4>experts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So these are all,</v>

714
00:39:57.480 --> 00:40:01.040
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these are no parties at one associated.</v>

715
00:40:01.130 --> 00:40:02.760
<v Speaker 4>They are all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I imagine,</v>

716
00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:03.623
<v Speaker 4>lots of psychologists and members of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Canadian Psychology Association and the </v>

717
00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:09.083
<v Speaker 4>Canadian Psychiatry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So how would you describe what you're </v>

718
00:40:10.981 --> 00:40:14.190
<v Speaker 4>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is your opinion,</v>

719
00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:17.700
<v Speaker 4>which you are absolutely entitled to </v>
<v Speaker 4>with what everyone is saying,</v>

720
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:23.000
<v Speaker 4>plus the feelings and testimonies of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>people who have suffered over 30 years.</v>

721
00:40:25.410 --> 00:40:29.250
<v Speaker 4>We've been taking issues to court.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These are people who will.</v>

722
00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:31.470
<v Speaker 4>We listened to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So how would we describe that?</v>

723
00:40:31.590 --> 00:40:32.220
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

724
00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:33.053
<v Speaker 2>with regards to your second point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the people that you're listening to </v>

725
00:40:35.821 --> 00:40:36.654
<v Speaker 2>are randomly selected from a population,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then their opinions are worthless from </v>

726
00:40:40.231 --> 00:40:41.064
<v Speaker 2>the perspective of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of testimony because you don't know if </v>

727
00:40:42.781 --> 00:40:45.900
<v Speaker 2>you're dealing with a biased sample.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a big problem with the public</v>

728
00:40:45.901 --> 00:40:46.734
<v Speaker 2>consultation process that underlies this</v>
<v Speaker 2>bill and you can not appreciate that if </v>

729
00:40:50.941 --> 00:40:53.370
<v Speaker 2>you'd like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's standard practice in any,</v>

730
00:40:53.610 --> 00:40:57.960
<v Speaker 2>in any polling institution or any body </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's attempting to extract the genuine</v>

731
00:40:57.961 --> 00:41:00.540
<v Speaker 2>opinion out of a so called community of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

732
00:41:00.690 --> 00:41:01.523
<v Speaker 2>And if that isn't followed then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't tell if the information that </v>

733
00:41:03.810 --> 00:41:04.643
<v Speaker 2>you're receiving is bias.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this with regards to your first </v>

734
00:41:07.351 --> 00:41:08.184
<v Speaker 2>point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what exactly are all those people who </v>

735
00:41:09.661 --> 00:41:10.494
<v Speaker 2>aren't thinking the same way as me sake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You said that there's a bunch of them </v>

736
00:41:13.230 --> 00:41:14.063
<v Speaker 2>and a bunch of groups,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you never said what they're saying </v>

737
00:41:16.590 --> 00:41:17.423
<v Speaker 2>precisely.</v>

738
00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:18.413
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think our chair who drew me out to 45 </v>

739
00:41:21.310 --> 00:41:24.830
<v Speaker 4>percent of your fund to vet out what </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're all saying,</v>

740
00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:29.630
<v Speaker 4>but in general they say they oppose </v>
<v Speaker 4>discrimination and harassment because of</v>

741
00:41:29.631 --> 00:41:33.410
<v Speaker 4>gender identity and gender expression </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then there's three pages.</v>

742
00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:34.473
<v Speaker 4>I can show it.</v>

743
00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:38.550
<v Speaker 2>I oppose discrimination against gender </v>
<v Speaker 2>identity and gender expression.</v>

744
00:41:38.551 --> 00:41:39.384
<v Speaker 2>That's not the point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The point is the specifics of the </v>

745
00:41:41.491 --> 00:41:45.650
<v Speaker 2>legislation that's around it and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>insistence that people will have to be a</v>

746
00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:48.780
<v Speaker 2>half to use compelled speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm objecting to.</v>

747
00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:51.150
<v Speaker 2>I've dealt with all sorts of people in </v>
<v Speaker 2>my life,</v>

748
00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:54.600
<v Speaker 2>very people who don't fit in and now all</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorts of different ways.</v>

749
00:41:54.601 --> 00:41:55.434
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a discriminatory person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's 500 hours of my teaching to my </v>

750
00:41:59.431 --> 00:42:01.290
<v Speaker 2>classrooms on tape,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on Youtube,</v>

751
00:42:01.291 --> 00:42:04.920
<v Speaker 2>but nobody's found a smoking pistol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a discriminatory individually,</v>

752
00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:08.670
<v Speaker 2>but I think this legislation is </v>
<v Speaker 2>reprehensible and I do not believe for a</v>

753
00:42:08.671 --> 00:42:10.890
<v Speaker 2>moment that it will do what it intends </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do.</v>

754
00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:11.873
<v Speaker 2>I also don't think that my opinion </v>
<v Speaker 2>deviates substantially from the bodies </v>

755
00:42:14.971 --> 00:42:15.804
<v Speaker 2>that you're describing because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't provided any evidence that they </v>

756
00:42:17.881 --> 00:42:18.714
<v Speaker 2>say anything other than discrimination </v>
<v Speaker 2>is a bad thing and I think that </v>

757
00:42:21.211 --> 00:42:24.750
<v Speaker 2>unreasonable discrimination is a bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing and it's unreasonable.</v>

758
00:42:24.751 --> 00:42:25.584
<v Speaker 2>When people are judged for any reason </v>
<v Speaker 2>other than the specific competence that </v>

759
00:42:29.191 --> 00:42:30.024
<v Speaker 2>they bring to say a given physician.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not in anyone's best interest that </v>

760
00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:33.863
<v Speaker 2>that occurs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think that you've </v>

761
00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:36.413
<v Speaker 2>demonstrated in the least that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>opinions that I'm putting forward are </v>

762
00:42:39.330 --> 00:42:40.163
<v Speaker 2>exist in opposition to the standard </v>
<v Speaker 2>practices of a say of my particular </v>

763
00:42:43.261 --> 00:42:44.094
<v Speaker 2>discipline.</v>

764
00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:49.630
<v Speaker 4>So could you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Could you repeat one more time?</v>

765
00:42:49.851 --> 00:42:52.290
<v Speaker 4>Your response to Senate says Golden </v>
<v Speaker 4>Pratt,</v>

766
00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:57.080
<v Speaker 4>that the Ontario human rights commission</v>
<v Speaker 4>has provided what I would say reasonable</v>

767
00:42:57.081 --> 00:43:02.081
<v Speaker 4>alternatives to your.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your objection to using pronouns?</v>

768
00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:06.110
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's been made clear in the,</v>

769
00:43:06.190 --> 00:43:07.023
<v Speaker 2>in the presentation so far is that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>depends on which part of the Ontario </v>

770
00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:11.660
<v Speaker 2>Human Rights Commission's policies you </v>
<v Speaker 2>read.</v>

771
00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:12.853
<v Speaker 2>And that's a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's one of the reasons I </v>

772
00:43:15.231 --> 00:43:16.064
<v Speaker 2>criticized this to begin with was </v>
<v Speaker 2>because when I went through the </v>

773
00:43:18.531 --> 00:43:19.364
<v Speaker 2>policies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could see that you're absolutely </v>

774
00:43:21.081 --> 00:43:23.120
<v Speaker 2>incoherent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

775
00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:24.560
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me give you another example.</v>

776
00:43:24.561 --> 00:43:25.394
<v Speaker 2>So there's an insistence in the Ontario </v>
<v Speaker 2>Human Rights Commission that sexual </v>

777
00:43:28.191 --> 00:43:29.024
<v Speaker 2>preferences and immutable phenomena,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which indicates at least in principle </v>

778
00:43:32.811 --> 00:43:35.300
<v Speaker 2>that it's biologically grounded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but on the same,</v>

779
00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:37.790
<v Speaker 2>by the same token,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in exactly the same policies,</v>

780
00:43:37.791 --> 00:43:38.624
<v Speaker 2>they presume that sexual identity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gender identity and gender expression </v>

781
00:43:41.511 --> 00:43:43.310
<v Speaker 2>are entirely independent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

782
00:43:43.311 --> 00:43:44.144
<v Speaker 2>sorry guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't have both of those because </v>

783
00:43:46.611 --> 00:43:51.010
<v Speaker 2>one's a and one's not a and you can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>put those together and like there's.</v>

784
00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:51.933
<v Speaker 2>There's endless numbers of places in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>policy surround surrounding bill c 16 </v>

785
00:43:57.561 --> 00:43:58.394
<v Speaker 2>that are characterized by that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>logical incoherency I mean what you're </v>

786
00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:02.173
<v Speaker 2>going to do to people who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>transgender who are making the claim </v>

787
00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:07.070
<v Speaker 2>that they were saved born that way at </v>
<v Speaker 2>birth,</v>

788
00:44:07.071 --> 00:44:10.010
<v Speaker 2>which is a strong claim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a biological claim.</v>

789
00:44:10.190 --> 00:44:11.023
<v Speaker 2>It indicates that there's a direct </v>
<v Speaker 2>causal connection between some </v>

790
00:44:13.701 --> 00:44:17.150
<v Speaker 2>biological phenomena and the expression </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a particular identity.</v>

791
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:19.760
<v Speaker 2>It's actually the strongest defense that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who have,</v>

792
00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:23.420
<v Speaker 2>let's call them nonstandard sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>identities or gender identities,</v>

793
00:44:23.570 --> 00:44:24.403
<v Speaker 2>have to defend the claim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I have to wrap it up there and move </v>

794
00:44:26.631 --> 00:44:31.631
<v Speaker 2>on to a senator well avenue Mr at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you</v>

795
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:32.940
<v Speaker 8>very much.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Mr Chair,</v>

796
00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:38.820
<v Speaker 8>I'll leave the time for our guests to </v>
<v Speaker 8>put in their translation devices.</v>

797
00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:44.180
<v Speaker 8>Thank you very much for being here.</v>
<v Speaker 8>My question is for Mr Peterson,</v>

798
00:44:44.971 --> 00:44:46.590
<v Speaker 8>do you have the interpretation now,</v>
<v Speaker 8>sir,</v>

799
00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:51.303
<v Speaker 9>so</v>

800
00:44:52.730 --> 00:44:55.340
<v Speaker 8>I'm still trying to orient myself a </v>
<v Speaker 8>little bit in this bill.</v>

801
00:44:55.341 --> 00:44:59.750
<v Speaker 8>I'm a little bit lost in the arguments </v>
<v Speaker 8>for and against,</v>

802
00:44:59.930 --> 00:45:00.763
<v Speaker 8>but some arguments really struck me </v>
<v Speaker 8>because some people said that without </v>

803
00:45:04.431 --> 00:45:09.310
<v Speaker 8>this bill</v>
<v Speaker 8>there might be suicides.</v>

804
00:45:09.311 --> 00:45:11.140
<v Speaker 8>People would become depressed.</v>

805
00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:12.913
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>

806
00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:16.200
<v Speaker 8>Transgender people of course,</v>

807
00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:21.750
<v Speaker 9>and</v>

808
00:45:21.970 --> 00:45:22.803
<v Speaker 8>it seems to me that this is almost an </v>
<v Speaker 8>extreme position that without this bill </v>

809
00:45:26.831 --> 00:45:28.900
<v Speaker 8>there would be an explosion of suicides </v>
<v Speaker 8>and depression.</v>

810
00:45:29.110 --> 00:45:32.520
<v Speaker 8>So I'd like to ask you a question.</v>
<v Speaker 8>As a professor now you work in the,</v>

811
00:45:32.890 --> 00:45:34.120
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the social sciences,</v>

812
00:45:34.121 --> 00:45:39.121
<v Speaker 8>you study human behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Are there studies or statistics</v>

813
00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:47.350
<v Speaker 8>about the consequences that this bill </v>
<v Speaker 8>would have on those people?</v>

814
00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:50.233
<v Speaker 8>Is this bill,</v>
<v Speaker 8>would this bill save as many lives and </v>

815
00:45:52.611 --> 00:45:54.110
<v Speaker 8>help as many people as it says?</v>

816
00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:56.580
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

817
00:45:56.580 --> 00:45:57.413
<v Speaker 2>in principle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would have that information if the </v>

818
00:46:00.090 --> 00:46:03.000
<v Speaker 2>policies that have already been </v>
<v Speaker 2>introduced by the provincial governments</v>

819
00:46:03.001 --> 00:46:05.580
<v Speaker 2>were assessed properly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as far as I know,</v>

820
00:46:05.581 --> 00:46:06.414
<v Speaker 2>there's been no known studies indicating</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the introduction of this </v>

821
00:46:09.451 --> 00:46:12.350
<v Speaker 2>legislation specifically has done </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything to modify the,</v>

822
00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:15.840
<v Speaker 2>the unfortunate rates of suicide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>depression,</v>

823
00:46:15.841 --> 00:46:18.740
<v Speaker 2>anxiety and so forth that are bitter </v>
<v Speaker 2>characteristic.</v>

824
00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:19.703
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could say often of marginalized </v>

825
00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:23.370
<v Speaker 2>groups,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's a bit of an overstatement.</v>

826
00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:25.280
<v Speaker 2>So no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't that,</v>

827
00:46:25.281 --> 00:46:26.114
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was part of my original claim is </v>

828
00:46:27.121 --> 00:46:29.250
<v Speaker 2>that there's no evidence that this sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

829
00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:31.140
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>legal redress,</v>

830
00:46:31.141 --> 00:46:34.440
<v Speaker 2>let's say is going to produce any of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>positive consequences that are intended.</v>

831
00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:37.920
<v Speaker 2>And I do believe that by making the </v>
<v Speaker 2>issue,</v>

832
00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:41.040
<v Speaker 2>let's say painfully visible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one way of thinking about it.</v>

833
00:46:41.041 --> 00:46:44.220
<v Speaker 2>There's actually had the opposite effect</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

834
00:46:44.221 --> 00:46:44.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

835
00:46:44.670 --> 00:46:45.540
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very,</v>

836
00:46:45.541 --> 00:46:47.460
<v Speaker 2>very common and this is something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

837
00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:48.473
<v Speaker 2>that's well known in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the relevant social sciences that </v>

838
00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:52.073
<v Speaker 2>just because you intend something to </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen when you make a large scale </v>

839
00:46:54.601 --> 00:46:55.434
<v Speaker 2>transformation doesn't indicate in any </v>
<v Speaker 2>manner that that's going to be the </v>

840
00:46:58.741 --> 00:46:59.574
<v Speaker 2>outcome.</v>

841
00:46:59.750 --> 00:47:00.583
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be lovely if things were that </v>

842
00:47:01.441 --> 00:47:02.274
<v Speaker 2>simple and I mean the best social </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientists always insist that you build </v>

843
00:47:06.931 --> 00:47:10.530
<v Speaker 2>an outcome analysis into any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into any broad scale,</v>

844
00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:11.453
<v Speaker 2>what would you call a social </v>
<v Speaker 2>intervention because there's a good </v>

845
00:47:14.911 --> 00:47:17.850
<v Speaker 2>chance it'll backfire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a high chance it'll backfire,</v>

846
00:47:17.851 --> 00:47:18.684
<v Speaker 2>so it's all presupposition and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>based at least in part on the notion </v>

847
00:47:23.490 --> 00:47:26.880
<v Speaker 2>that the transgender community is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>community and that there are voices that</v>

848
00:47:26.881 --> 00:47:30.640
<v Speaker 2>speak for them homogenously and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what they all want and that will</v>

849
00:47:30.641 --> 00:47:34.860
<v Speaker 2>work as intended.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to me looking at this from,</v>

850
00:47:35.190 --> 00:47:37.020
<v Speaker 2>from the social science perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

851
00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:39.013
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing about it that's </v>

852
00:47:39.881 --> 00:47:43.060
<v Speaker 2>credible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Missy and I also don't buy the intent,</v>

853
00:47:43.150 --> 00:47:44.760
<v Speaker 2>so good.</v>

854
00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:47.910
<v Speaker 8>Senator Dupuis.</v>
<v Speaker 8>See Ms Dot.</v>

855
00:47:48.770 --> 00:47:49.603
<v Speaker 8>Thank you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Mr Chairman.</v>

856
00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:53.750
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>

857
00:47:53.970 --> 00:47:54.803
<v Speaker 8>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'd like to ask a question to Mr </v>

858
00:47:56.880 --> 00:48:01.880
<v Speaker 8>Peterson and perhaps I would also have a</v>
<v Speaker 8>question for Mr Brown.</v>

859
00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:08.380
<v Speaker 8>My question is as follows,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Dr Peterson.</v>

860
00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:11.050
<v Speaker 8>I'm trying to understand your position.</v>

861
00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:12.633
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>

862
00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:14.583
<v Speaker 8>Do you see a difference</v>
<v Speaker 8>between the opinions that you expressed </v>

863
00:48:20.561 --> 00:48:23.710
<v Speaker 8>that you were expressing today on this </v>
<v Speaker 8>issue</v>

864
00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:28.060
<v Speaker 8>as part of this public consultation?</v>

865
00:48:30.450 --> 00:48:31.380
<v Speaker 9>Okay,</v>

866
00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:32.453
<v Speaker 8>and the actions that you take as a </v>
<v Speaker 8>university professor where you are in a </v>

867
00:48:39.601 --> 00:48:42.930
<v Speaker 8>position of authority and power over </v>
<v Speaker 8>your students?</v>

868
00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:48.681
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

869
00:48:48.681 --> 00:48:52.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't necessarily consider myself in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>position of authority and power.</v>

870
00:48:52.431 --> 00:48:55.100
<v Speaker 2>I consider myself in a position of </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility.</v>

871
00:48:55.610 --> 00:48:56.443
<v Speaker 2>Those aren't the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't agree with the way that the </v>

872
00:48:59.120 --> 00:48:59.953
<v Speaker 2>question is formulated and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand what that has to do with my </v>

873
00:49:02.961 --> 00:49:05.660
<v Speaker 2>stance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if I believe that the legislation</v>

874
00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:10.100
<v Speaker 2>is going to do more harm than good and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>also firmly believe which I do,</v>

875
00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:14.510
<v Speaker 2>that it is more in the issue of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideological move than,</v>

876
00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:15.373
<v Speaker 2>than,</v>
<v Speaker 2>than something that's designed to </v>

877
00:49:16.431 --> 00:49:18.770
<v Speaker 2>address the concerns that it purports to</v>
<v Speaker 2>address.</v>

878
00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:21.650
<v Speaker 2>I would also like to point out briefly </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you know,</v>

879
00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:22.813
<v Speaker 2>what should have happened when I made </v>
<v Speaker 2>that video and this is relevant to the </v>

880
00:49:24.801 --> 00:49:25.634
<v Speaker 2>question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that like maybe people paid </v>

881
00:49:27.831 --> 00:49:28.664
<v Speaker 2>attention to 10 minutes to do to it for </v>
<v Speaker 2>10 minutes and maybe he'd got a </v>

882
00:49:31.071 --> 00:49:32.750
<v Speaker 2>newspaper article and then it </v>
<v Speaker 2>disappeared.</v>

883
00:49:33.070 --> 00:49:35.810
<v Speaker 2>But I put my finger on something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I thought.</v>

884
00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:38.900
<v Speaker 2>And the fact that this issue hasn't gone</v>
<v Speaker 2>away in nine months,</v>

885
00:49:38.901 --> 00:49:39.734
<v Speaker 2>quite the contrary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's exploded not only in Canada but in </v>

886
00:49:42.171 --> 00:49:43.004
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of parts of the world means </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I means to me that I have some </v>

887
00:49:46.281 --> 00:49:47.114
<v Speaker 2>evidence that my choice of level of </v>
<v Speaker 2>analysis was correct and that there's </v>

888
00:49:50.031 --> 00:49:52.250
<v Speaker 2>far more going on here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>

889
00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:53.113
<v Speaker 2>Then the mirror surface issue that we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>purporting to discuss and so I take </v>

890
00:49:57.591 --> 00:50:01.700
<v Speaker 2>exception to the notion that I'm somehow</v>
<v Speaker 2>abandoning my personal responsibility to</v>

891
00:50:01.701 --> 00:50:02.534
<v Speaker 2>my students,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is something that I believe is in </v>

892
00:50:04.041 --> 00:50:04.874
<v Speaker 2>fact driving what I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that my obligation to my </v>

893
00:50:07.311 --> 00:50:08.144
<v Speaker 2>students constantly used to tell them </v>
<v Speaker 2>what I think and to make that as </v>

894
00:50:11.361 --> 00:50:15.230
<v Speaker 2>informed and careful and opinion as I </v>
<v Speaker 2>can possibly matter.</v>

895
00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:17.150
<v Speaker 2>Map Master.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I do.</v>

896
00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:22.120
<v Speaker 8>Zip asked him component.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You can see.</v>

897
00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:24.103
<v Speaker 8>I think that you understand that if you </v>
<v Speaker 8>come to participate or to appear a </v>

898
00:50:27.891 --> 00:50:28.724
<v Speaker 8>Senate committee studying a bill,</v>
<v Speaker 8>regardless of what we think of the </v>

899
00:50:31.881 --> 00:50:36.800
<v Speaker 8>question</v>
<v Speaker 8>that.</v>

900
00:50:37.870 --> 00:50:39.410
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 8>my question for you is,</v>

901
00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:43.130
<v Speaker 8>do you make a difference between your </v>
<v Speaker 8>opinion,</v>

902
00:50:43.131 --> 00:50:48.131
<v Speaker 8>what you say and the fact that the </v>
<v Speaker 8>university which pays you,</v>

903
00:50:48.441 --> 00:50:53.441
<v Speaker 8>I believe unless I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the university considers you to be under</v>

904
00:50:55.311 --> 00:50:56.144
<v Speaker 8>its legal responsibility and so you are </v>
<v Speaker 8>in a situation of authority over your </v>

905
00:51:04.521 --> 00:51:08.780
<v Speaker 8>students and this means that you can </v>
<v Speaker 8>give an,</v>

906
00:51:08.781 --> 00:51:10.370
<v Speaker 8>a or an f to your students</v>

907
00:51:10.810 --> 00:51:14.480
<v Speaker 2>components of the legislation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's rolling.</v>

908
00:51:14.490 --> 00:51:16.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to move on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Senator Mcdonald,</v>

909
00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:21.950
<v Speaker 1>you can care</v>
<v Speaker 1>for you.</v>

910
00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:23.433
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that concerns me most in this </v>

911
00:51:26.551 --> 00:51:30.420
<v Speaker 1>legislation is compelled speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's very concerning.</v>

912
00:51:31.150 --> 00:51:31.983
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this committee is hearing from Megan </v>

913
00:51:34.650 --> 00:51:38.400
<v Speaker 1>Murphy who told us her opposition to </v>
<v Speaker 1>this concept of gender fluidity,</v>

914
00:51:38.970 --> 00:51:42.120
<v Speaker 1>fluidity because you believe gender is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>social construction.</v>

915
00:51:42.660 --> 00:51:43.493
<v Speaker 1>And Dr Gad Saad also posed for this </v>
<v Speaker 1>legislation because of his belief in </v>

916
00:51:47.371 --> 00:51:48.204
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary biology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What this shows is that with bill </v>

917
00:51:51.961 --> 00:51:56.130
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] and we are prematurely </v>
<v Speaker 1>shutting down a discussion on gender and</v>

918
00:51:56.131 --> 00:51:58.600
<v Speaker 1>sex as far from settler appears to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>fair,</v>

919
00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:00.290
<v Speaker 1>settled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

920
00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:01.243
<v Speaker 1>and in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we looked at the provincial </v>

921
00:52:02.041 --> 00:52:06.750
<v Speaker 1>definition is set up by the commissions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are enshrining the theory of a gender</v>

922
00:52:06.751 --> 00:52:09.800
<v Speaker 1>spectrum into the law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm one of you can comment on</v>

923
00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:11.693
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly what we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're in and I think I think that that </v>

924
00:52:14.161 --> 00:52:16.980
<v Speaker 2>might even be more dangerous than in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>opinion,</v>

925
00:52:16.981 --> 00:52:17.814
<v Speaker 2>than the compelled speech issue because </v>
<v Speaker 2>the social constructionist view of </v>

926
00:52:21.631 --> 00:52:24.360
<v Speaker 2>gender isn't another opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just wrong.</v>

927
00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:28.260
<v Speaker 2>So because I can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you why that is fairly.</v>

928
00:52:28.450 --> 00:52:31.500
<v Speaker 2>I'll take one minute to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

929
00:52:31.530 --> 00:52:36.210
<v Speaker 2>the proposition that's instantiated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example in this particular visual,</v>

930
00:52:36.211 --> 00:52:39.690
<v Speaker 2>which is a good representation of the of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the philosophy of the policies,</v>

931
00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:41.033
<v Speaker 2>is that there is no causal relationship </v>
<v Speaker 2>between these four dimensions of </v>

932
00:52:44.101 --> 00:52:49.101
<v Speaker 2>identity and that's palpably observed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean 98 percent of people.</v>

933
00:52:49.310 --> 00:52:50.143
<v Speaker 2>It's 99 point seven percent of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who inhabit a body with a given </v>

934
00:52:53.611 --> 00:52:56.970
<v Speaker 2>biological sex identify it with that </v>
<v Speaker 2>biological sex.</v>

935
00:52:57.130 --> 00:52:59.910
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's incredibly tightly linked.</v>

936
00:52:59.911 --> 00:53:00.744
<v Speaker 2>If you can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>attribute causality to a link that </v>

937
00:53:04.231 --> 00:53:05.970
<v Speaker 2>that's tight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's tight.</v>

938
00:53:05.971 --> 00:53:06.804
<v Speaker 2>You have to dispense with the notion of </v>
<v Speaker 2>causality altogether and then of the </v>

939
00:53:10.111 --> 00:53:10.944
<v Speaker 2>people who who identify as say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as male or female who were also </v>

940
00:53:14.131 --> 00:53:15.780
<v Speaker 2>biologically male or female.</v>

941
00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:16.673
<v Speaker 2>The vast majority of them have this </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexual preference that would go along </v>

942
00:53:18.991 --> 00:53:21.810
<v Speaker 2>with that and the gender identity and </v>
<v Speaker 2>gender expression.</v>

943
00:53:22.230 --> 00:53:23.063
<v Speaker 2>These,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these levels of analysis are </v>

944
00:53:23.971 --> 00:53:24.804
<v Speaker 2>unbelievably tightly linked and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the evidence that biological factors </v>

945
00:53:28.351 --> 00:53:32.460
<v Speaker 2>play a role in determining gender </v>
<v Speaker 2>identity is in a word overwhelming.</v>

946
00:53:32.461 --> 00:53:36.720
<v Speaker 2>There isn't a serious scientist alive </v>
<v Speaker 2>who would dispute that now you get,</v>

947
00:53:36.870 --> 00:53:37.703
<v Speaker 2>you get disputes about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they always stem from essentially </v>

948
00:53:40.351 --> 00:53:43.770
<v Speaker 2>from the humanities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as far as I'm concerned,</v>

949
00:53:43.830 --> 00:53:44.663
<v Speaker 2>I've looked at it very carefully.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those arguments are entirely </v>

950
00:53:47.491 --> 00:53:48.324
<v Speaker 2>ideologically driven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a tenant of the ideology that </v>

951
00:53:51.091 --> 00:53:51.924
<v Speaker 2>identity is socially constructed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's partly why it's been </v>

952
00:53:54.181 --> 00:53:57.840
<v Speaker 2>instantiated into law because there's no</v>
<v Speaker 2>way they're going to win the argument,</v>

953
00:53:58.110 --> 00:54:00.480
<v Speaker 2>but they can certainly win,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say the propaganda war,</v>

954
00:54:00.481 --> 00:54:03.570
<v Speaker 2>especially by foisting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this sort of reprehensible,</v>

955
00:54:03.870 --> 00:54:05.970
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>advertising information on children.</v>

956
00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:09.150
<v Speaker 2>And that's part of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's part of the express intent.</v>

957
00:54:09.330 --> 00:54:10.163
<v Speaker 1>I would add.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A trans complainants have been covered </v>

958
00:54:13.231 --> 00:54:16.860
<v Speaker 1>under the existing grounds of sex before</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tribunals across Canada.</v>

959
00:54:17.370 --> 00:54:21.480
<v Speaker 1>And as the Minister of Justice said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are bringing this legislation in as</v>

960
00:54:21.481 --> 00:54:23.940
<v Speaker 1>a symbolic gesture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

961
00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:24.873
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I leave it to you to question what that </v>

962
00:54:25.741 --> 00:54:26.730
<v Speaker 1>gesture may be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

963
00:54:26.850 --> 00:54:27.683
<v Speaker 1>but this community has been protected </v>
<v Speaker 1>under the existing grounds that are </v>

964
00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:33.060
<v Speaker 1>found in most of the human rights codes </v>
<v Speaker 1>across,</v>

965
00:54:33.061 --> 00:54:33.894
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>across Canada and on the grounds of sex </v>

966
00:54:36.270 --> 00:54:38.330
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Senator Israel,</v>

967
00:54:40.550 --> 00:54:43.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr Brown or Mr Peterson,</v>

968
00:54:43.420 --> 00:54:44.830
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

969
00:54:45.100 --> 00:54:48.670
<v Speaker 1>Justice Wagner from the Supreme Court in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a seminar,</v>

970
00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:51.270
<v Speaker 1>the Ottawa University,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

971
00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:52.193
<v Speaker 1>in early March of this year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was a couple of months ago that </v>

972
00:54:55.260 --> 00:54:57.600
<v Speaker 1>stated the following,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

973
00:54:57.601 --> 00:55:01.050
<v Speaker 1>he was not giving a decision from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bench you.</v>

974
00:55:01.100 --> 00:55:04.470
<v Speaker 1>Nobody was expressing his views.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you allow me,</v>

975
00:55:04.471 --> 00:55:05.304
<v Speaker 1>I will quote him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's short when the court eventually </v>

976
00:55:08.221 --> 00:55:11.910
<v Speaker 1>faces a question touching on transgender</v>
<v Speaker 1>identity.</v>

977
00:55:12.750 --> 00:55:16.380
<v Speaker 1>These to preposition will provide </v>
<v Speaker 1>essential frames of reference.</v>

978
00:55:16.530 --> 00:55:19.770
<v Speaker 1>First one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that identity is not fixed,</v>

979
00:55:19.950 --> 00:55:24.390
<v Speaker 1>but changing as the first proposal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the second one,</v>

980
00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:29.280
<v Speaker 1>that identity is not innate but </v>
<v Speaker 1>contextual.</v>

981
00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:32.460
<v Speaker 1>I'll repeat that the identity is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>innate,</v>

982
00:55:32.670 --> 00:55:33.870
<v Speaker 1>but contextual or,</v>

983
00:55:34.450 --> 00:55:35.780
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>end of quote.</v>

984
00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:37.730
<v Speaker 10>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I,</v>

985
00:55:37.740 --> 00:55:38.573
<v Speaker 10>I,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I read that and I try to understand the </v>

986
00:55:41.511 --> 00:55:43.160
<v Speaker 10>implication,</v>
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

987
00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:44.960
<v Speaker 10>of this,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

988
00:55:44.961 --> 00:55:47.180
<v Speaker 10>those two binary kinds of,</v>
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

989
00:55:47.190 --> 00:55:48.023
<v Speaker 10>of,</v>
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

990
00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:48.973
<v Speaker 10>elements of that and he says the court,</v>
<v Speaker 10>so I bet that he might have spoken to </v>

991
00:55:53.871 --> 00:55:56.720
<v Speaker 10>colleagues or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the profession generally</v>

992
00:55:58.280 --> 00:55:59.113
<v Speaker 10>would you,</v>
<v Speaker 10>would you have a quarrel with that kind </v>

993
00:56:02.661 --> 00:56:03.494
<v Speaker 10>of approach to the definition of </v>
<v Speaker 10>transgender a reality or a few things </v>

994
00:56:08.710 --> 00:56:09.543
<v Speaker 10>that it's a proper way of approaching </v>
<v Speaker 10>legally the issues because as you </v>

995
00:56:16.251 --> 00:56:18.830
<v Speaker 10>forcefully explain,</v>
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

996
00:56:19.340 --> 00:56:21.140
<v Speaker 10>somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 10>one day my challenge,</v>

997
00:56:21.150 --> 00:56:21.711
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

998
00:56:21.711 --> 00:56:25.930
<v Speaker 10>the proposal,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the policies and all wet could stem from</v>

999
00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:29.380
<v Speaker 10>the enactment of those legislations.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So in other words,</v>

1000
00:56:29.381 --> 00:56:32.410
<v Speaker 10>we'll find ourselves into court one day </v>
<v Speaker 10>and we will have to,</v>

1001
00:56:32.411 --> 00:56:33.250
<v Speaker 10>are,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

1002
00:56:33.251 --> 00:56:34.084
<v Speaker 10>to analyze and argue the case at least </v>
<v Speaker 10>taking into account that references </v>

1003
00:56:40.420 --> 00:56:41.253
<v Speaker 10>those references.</v>
<v Speaker 10>That just is wagner mentioned not long </v>

1004
00:56:43.661 --> 00:56:45.080
<v Speaker 10>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So I'll you,</v>

1005
00:56:45.090 --> 00:56:47.020
<v Speaker 10>you will react to that.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Well,</v>

1006
00:56:47.021 --> 00:56:50.560
<v Speaker 10>I want to make sure I understand your </v>
<v Speaker 10>question properly.</v>

1007
00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:51.513
<v Speaker 10>So</v>

1008
00:56:51.530 --> 00:56:53.060
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the justice said this,</v>

1009
00:56:53.090 --> 00:56:53.923
<v Speaker 2>was he implying that the identity is not</v>
<v Speaker 2>fixed but it is changing and that </v>

1010
00:56:58.761 --> 00:57:03.100
<v Speaker 2>identity wasn't innate and it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>contextual or was he outlining the,</v>

1011
00:57:03.150 --> 00:57:03.983
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1012
00:57:04.220 --> 00:57:05.910
<v Speaker 2>the arena within which</v>

1013
00:57:05.950 --> 00:57:07.380
<v Speaker 10>this debate might take place?</v>
<v Speaker 10>No,</v>

1014
00:57:07.390 --> 00:57:08.710
<v Speaker 10>he was essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it was,</v>

1015
00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:10.420
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 10>there was another speech on this.</v>

1016
00:57:10.450 --> 00:57:11.283
<v Speaker 10>Essentially it was more if I can use an </v>
<v Speaker 10>expression that Mr Brown will </v>

1017
00:57:14.291 --> 00:57:16.520
<v Speaker 10>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It was rather an arbitrary,</v>

1018
00:57:16.521 --> 00:57:17.710
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 10>in a conference.</v>

1019
00:57:17.830 --> 00:57:20.740
<v Speaker 10>The conference was about identity.</v>
<v Speaker 10>But of course,</v>

1020
00:57:20.741 --> 00:57:21.660
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>since uh,</v>

1021
00:57:21.670 --> 00:57:26.050
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 10>identity is a topic of comment on common</v>

1022
00:57:26.051 --> 00:57:28.370
<v Speaker 10>debates in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 10>He felt that,</v>

1023
00:57:28.371 --> 00:57:29.870
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it was fully,</v>

1024
00:57:29.871 --> 00:57:30.910
<v Speaker 10>if he would,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

1025
00:57:31.210 --> 00:57:32.043
<v Speaker 10>I should say,</v>
<v Speaker 10>put his grain of salt in the public </v>

1026
00:57:34.241 --> 00:57:38.170
<v Speaker 10>debate by establishing what he thinks </v>
<v Speaker 10>is,</v>

1027
00:57:38.420 --> 00:57:39.253
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 10>out to define transgender identity and </v>

1028
00:57:41.950 --> 00:57:44.560
<v Speaker 10>establish some parameters.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Let's,</v>

1029
00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:47.830
<v Speaker 2>let's assume that it is changing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>contextual.</v>

1030
00:57:48.700 --> 00:57:49.533
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then why is conversion therapy a </v>

1031
00:57:50.620 --> 00:57:52.570
<v Speaker 2>problem?</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

1032
00:57:52.571 --> 00:57:53.404
<v Speaker 2>this is what I see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing is is that when I started </v>

1033
00:57:55.511 --> 00:57:56.344
<v Speaker 2>opposing this bill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people immediately assume that I was </v>

1034
00:57:58.271 --> 00:57:59.104
<v Speaker 2>transphobic and racist and all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>other epithets that they're perfectly </v>

1035
00:58:02.051 --> 00:58:04.150
<v Speaker 2>willing to try it forth at a moment's </v>
<v Speaker 2>notice,</v>

1036
00:58:04.540 --> 00:58:05.373
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's been a tremendous attempt to </v>

1037
00:58:07.270 --> 00:58:09.520
<v Speaker 2>make conversion therapy for people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>are gay,</v>

1038
00:58:09.521 --> 00:58:10.480
<v Speaker 2>illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1039
00:58:10.481 --> 00:58:14.500
<v Speaker 2>And the proposition is predicated on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>idea that the identity,</v>

1040
00:58:14.501 --> 00:58:18.640
<v Speaker 2>the sexual preference,</v>
<v Speaker 2>identity is not changing nor contextual.</v>

1041
00:58:18.910 --> 00:58:19.743
<v Speaker 2>It's fundamental.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And really what that means is that it's </v>

1042
00:58:21.311 --> 00:58:23.110
<v Speaker 2>grounded in something like biology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1043
00:58:23.111 --> 00:58:23.741
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fine,</v>

1044
00:58:23.741 --> 00:58:24.940
<v Speaker 2>let's scrap that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1045
00:58:24.941 --> 00:58:26.890
<v Speaker 2>now it's going to be changing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>contextual.</v>

1046
00:58:27.130 --> 00:58:27.963
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then why can't it be changed with </v>

1047
00:58:29.741 --> 00:58:30.574
<v Speaker 2>context?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is part of the problem with the </v>

1048
00:58:34.091 --> 00:58:34.924
<v Speaker 2>policies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there so incoherent that they're </v>

1049
00:58:36.281 --> 00:58:39.250
<v Speaker 2>going to work against the people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're designed to protect?</v>

1050
00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:41.980
<v Speaker 2>Now people have a hard time believing I </v>
<v Speaker 2>care about that,</v>

1051
00:58:41.981 --> 00:58:42.814
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that I've been called things </v>

1052
00:58:44.381 --> 00:58:49.210
<v Speaker 2>doesn't mean that that's what I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know a lot of people who have,</v>

1053
00:58:49.780 --> 00:58:50.613
<v Speaker 2>let's call it a nonstandard identity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tightest argument they have for </v>

1054
00:58:55.331 --> 00:58:56.164
<v Speaker 2>public acceptance of that identity is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's powerfully constrained by </v>

1055
00:58:59.441 --> 00:59:03.160
<v Speaker 2>biological processes that are beyond </v>
<v Speaker 2>their voluntary control.</v>

1056
00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:04.353
<v Speaker 2>So instantiate this view of humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the social constructionist view of </v>

1057
00:59:07.751 --> 00:59:08.584
<v Speaker 2>humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can waive those claims goodbye </v>

1058
00:59:09.940 --> 00:59:10.773
<v Speaker 2>because they are completely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are at complete odds with the </v>

1059
00:59:14.561 --> 00:59:18.290
<v Speaker 2>social constructionist view point and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think that's a big mistake and I,</v>

1060
00:59:18.291 --> 00:59:19.124
<v Speaker 2>I really do believe that that will </v>
<v Speaker 2>backfire hard against the people who </v>

1061
00:59:23.030 --> 00:59:26.120
<v Speaker 2>this legislation is designed to protect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's mutable,</v>

1062
00:59:26.121 --> 00:59:26.954
<v Speaker 2>changeable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>only subjective and transformable on a </v>

1063
00:59:30.021 --> 00:59:30.854
<v Speaker 2>whim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then why should anyone have any respect </v>

1064
00:59:33.261 --> 00:59:34.370
<v Speaker 2>for it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gentleman,</v>

1065
00:59:34.390 --> 00:59:35.223
<v Speaker 2>they going to have to intervene.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The hour has flown by and we very much </v>

1066
00:59:38.391 --> 00:59:40.850
<v Speaker 2>appreciate your appearance here today </v>
<v Speaker 2>and your testimony as well.</v>

1067
00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:41.743
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll suspend briefly before hearing </v>

1068
00:59:44.241 --> 00:59:45.074
<v Speaker 2>from an expert.</v>
