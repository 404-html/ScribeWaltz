1
00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.450
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome back.</v>

2
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.620
<v Speaker 1>So the next four lectures are also</v>
<v Speaker 1>oriented towards discussion of primarily</v>

3
00:00:17.371 --> 00:00:21.660
<v Speaker 1>clinical theories of psychology and </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychopathology.</v>

4
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.013
<v Speaker 1>We're going to talk about lines of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking that in some ways run parallel </v>

5
00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:32.664
<v Speaker 1>to those of the site ground lists </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the thinkers we're going to </v>

6
00:00:35.161 --> 00:00:37.530
<v Speaker 1>discuss now and with a few small </v>
<v Speaker 1>exceptions,</v>

7
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.263
<v Speaker 1>well all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the thinkers we're going to </v>

8
00:00:41.131 --> 00:00:46.131
<v Speaker 1>discuss in the next four lectures were </v>
<v Speaker 1>either influenced heavily by Freud,</v>

9
00:00:46.711 --> 00:00:50.550
<v Speaker 1>human adler or</v>
<v Speaker 1>word themselves,</v>

10
00:00:50.551 --> 00:00:55.551
<v Speaker 1>thinkers who influenced Freud in me up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's an intellectual continuity</v>

11
00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.963
<v Speaker 1>stretching over with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with people who are deeply educated and </v>

12
00:01:03.211 --> 00:01:06.250
<v Speaker 1>who are very thoughtful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's intellectual continuity ideas,</v>

13
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.210
<v Speaker 1>stretching over exceptional spans of </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

14
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.970
<v Speaker 1>And so it's exactly the sort of thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you would,</v>

15
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.680
<v Speaker 1>that sort of relationship is exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you'd imagined.</v>

16
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.900
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roger has had a variety of influences,</v>

17
00:01:18.901 --> 00:01:19.734
<v Speaker 1>so let's say Freud and Jung and Adler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was also very much influenced by </v>

18
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.480
<v Speaker 1>phenomenological ideas and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenologists app were,</v>

19
00:01:29.551 --> 00:01:34.170
<v Speaker 1>and our phenomenologies a brand of </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy and</v>

20
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.640
<v Speaker 1>which I'll explain more deeply.</v>

21
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.473
<v Speaker 1>And the other primary domain of </v>
<v Speaker 1>influence on Rogers was Christianity </v>

22
00:01:43.621 --> 00:01:44.310
<v Speaker 1>likely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

23
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.143
<v Speaker 1>and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity also via probably northern </v>

24
00:01:49.291 --> 00:01:52.010
<v Speaker 1>European culture as far as I can tell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason I'm,</v>

25
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.093
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking specifically about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity in relationship to rogers </v>

26
00:01:55.771 --> 00:01:59.940
<v Speaker 1>is because as a young man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a fundamentalist Christian and he</v>

27
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.350
<v Speaker 1>was a seminarian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we had,</v>

28
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.530
<v Speaker 1>he was quite oriented towards</v>
<v Speaker 1>mainline Protestant Christianity.</v>

29
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.830
<v Speaker 1>But when he was in university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had a crisis of belief,</v>

30
00:02:10.831 --> 00:02:14.430
<v Speaker 1>I suppose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he was even going to go to China as</v>

31
00:02:14.431 --> 00:02:17.040
<v Speaker 1>a missionary at one point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

32
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:18.503
<v Speaker 1>but he had a crisis of belief in </v>
<v Speaker 1>university because he'd also been </v>

33
00:02:20.611 --> 00:02:21.444
<v Speaker 1>scientifically trained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His father was a farmer who used rather </v>

34
00:02:25.351 --> 00:02:26.184
<v Speaker 1>advanced farming techniques.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so rogers was trained to think </v>

35
00:02:28.711 --> 00:02:29.544
<v Speaker 1>scientifically from a very young age and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he experienced the conflict between his </v>

36
00:02:32.731 --> 00:02:36.090
<v Speaker 1>religious belief and his scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions quite intensely.</v>

37
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.480
<v Speaker 1>And in that battle is formal Christian </v>
<v Speaker 1>belief was the loser.</v>

38
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.893
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his thinking is very much influenced by </v>

39
00:02:46.801 --> 00:02:49.290
<v Speaker 1>fundamentalist Protestant </v>
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions.</v>

40
00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:50.483
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

41
00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.440
<v Speaker 1>the effect of those all described as we </v>
<v Speaker 1>walked through Roger's thinking.</v>

42
00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:59.643
<v Speaker 1>Now</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's important to understand the </v>

43
00:03:02.831 --> 00:03:07.831
<v Speaker 1>philosophical underpinnings of a global </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality or psychology theory because</v>

44
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.460
<v Speaker 1>every theory is set within a set of </v>
<v Speaker 1>assumptions,</v>

45
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.660
<v Speaker 1>things that you have to assume to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>true in order to proceed with the theory</v>

46
00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.450
<v Speaker 1>and like the axioms in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

47
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in classical geometry,</v>

48
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.990
<v Speaker 1>you can't prove the axiom that you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to accept them.</v>

49
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.003
<v Speaker 1>Once you accept the axioms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can move forward and use the </v>

50
00:03:32.171 --> 00:03:33.004
<v Speaker 1>whole system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the reason that systems have to </v>

51
00:03:35.681 --> 00:03:37.200
<v Speaker 1>have axioms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are items,</v>

52
00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.080
<v Speaker 1>elements of belief is because every </v>
<v Speaker 1>system is incomplete,</v>

53
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.000
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't cover the entire world.</v>

54
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.290
<v Speaker 1>And so in some sense you need a place to</v>
<v Speaker 1>dispense with your ignorance.</v>

55
00:03:49.511 --> 00:03:51.580
<v Speaker 1>And the way you do that is by making </v>
<v Speaker 1>assumptions.</v>

56
00:03:51.581 --> 00:03:52.414
<v Speaker 1>We're going to act as if the following </v>
<v Speaker 1>is true and then you can proceed with a </v>

57
00:03:57.071 --> 00:03:59.650
<v Speaker 1>partial theory and you'll have some </v>
<v Speaker 1>success with it.</v>

58
00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:01.623
<v Speaker 1>But it's useful to understand the </v>
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions because they'd orients </v>

59
00:04:04.421 --> 00:04:05.254
<v Speaker 1>you properly towards the theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now Rogers is a phenomenologist and </v>

60
00:04:10.931 --> 00:04:11.764
<v Speaker 1>phenomenology is a brand of philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I believe started with Edmund </v>

61
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:16.743
<v Speaker 1>Husserl but was probably made most </v>
<v Speaker 1>influential by his student Martin </v>

62
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.210
<v Speaker 1>Heidegger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now heidegger</v>

63
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.440
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a philosopher,</v>

64
00:04:29.441 --> 00:04:30.274
<v Speaker 1>I suppose something somewhat like Nicha </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that he was very much his thinking </v>

65
00:04:34.571 --> 00:04:35.404
<v Speaker 1>around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very much counter to what you might </v>

66
00:04:36.311 --> 00:04:40.010
<v Speaker 1>describe as general academic philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

67
00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.163
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heidegger believed that ever since the </v>

68
00:04:44.021 --> 00:04:44.854
<v Speaker 1>time of Plato,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is when people think philosophy </v>

69
00:04:48.011 --> 00:04:53.011
<v Speaker 1>began more or less western philosophy </v>
<v Speaker 1>had taken an erroneous direction.</v>

70
00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:55.683
<v Speaker 1>It had become too concerned with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature of structures of thought and not </v>

71
00:05:00.191 --> 00:05:02.980
<v Speaker 1>concerned enough about the nature of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>

72
00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:04.293
<v Speaker 1>And so you can determine those two </v>
<v Speaker 1>things being as how things are and </v>

73
00:05:06.881 --> 00:05:09.010
<v Speaker 1>thought of course is how you represent </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

74
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:14.970
<v Speaker 1>And one of heidegger's</v>
<v Speaker 1>missions was to reestablish being as the</v>

75
00:05:17.081 --> 00:05:21.550
<v Speaker 1>central</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality of philosophy.</v>

76
00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:27.090
<v Speaker 1>Now that begs a question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what is being well</v>

77
00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:31.743
<v Speaker 1>to conceptualize reality as being is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>to conceptualize it the same way that </v>

78
00:05:36.251 --> 00:05:37.660
<v Speaker 1>you conceptualize it</v>

79
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:42.333
<v Speaker 1>in terms of modern Western thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because one of the presuppositions at </v>

80
00:05:47.801 --> 00:05:48.634
<v Speaker 1>the basis of modern Western thought is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the most intelligent way to divide </v>

81
00:05:54.071 --> 00:05:54.904
<v Speaker 1>up the world is in terms of subjective </v>
<v Speaker 1>and objective experience or subjective </v>

82
00:06:00.231 --> 00:06:02.840
<v Speaker 1>and subjective experience and object of </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

83
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:04.153
<v Speaker 1>So the fundamental scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>presupposition you might say is that </v>

84
00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:12.320
<v Speaker 1>there is an objective world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the real thing.</v>

85
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:16.310
<v Speaker 1>You come to that by performing certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>procedures,</v>

86
00:06:16.311 --> 00:06:18.500
<v Speaker 1>documenting them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>describe them,</v>

87
00:06:18.501 --> 00:06:21.950
<v Speaker 1>the outcome of those procedures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>documenting them and then allowing other</v>

88
00:06:21.951 --> 00:06:22.784
<v Speaker 1>people to do the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>operating under the presupposition that </v>

89
00:06:25.911 --> 00:06:29.870
<v Speaker 1>if they experience the same outcome from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the procedures,</v>

90
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.200
<v Speaker 1>then what they're experiencing is real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's basically the scientific method,</v>

91
00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:35.330
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Method results.</v>

92
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:37.550
<v Speaker 1>You detailed the method,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is how you act on the world.</v>

93
00:06:37.551 --> 00:06:38.384
<v Speaker 1>You'd get the results,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you compare them maybe across multiple </v>

94
00:06:40.941 --> 00:06:41.774
<v Speaker 1>observations that you do and then other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people do multiple observations that </v>

95
00:06:44.921 --> 00:06:47.060
<v Speaker 1>you've come up with that with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consensus,</v>

96
00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:48.223
<v Speaker 1>but it's a method bound consensus and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then of course you abstract out general </v>

97
00:06:51.321 --> 00:06:53.600
<v Speaker 1>principles from that and it works very </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerfully,</v>

98
00:06:53.601 --> 00:06:55.070
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make no mistake about it.</v>

99
00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:56.473
<v Speaker 1>The objective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that there was an objective </v>

100
00:06:59.030 --> 00:06:59.863
<v Speaker 1>external world and that that's the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>way to conceptualize reality is an </v>

101
00:07:03.021 --> 00:07:04.730
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably powerful tool.</v>

102
00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:08.933
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not it's an accurate </v>

103
00:07:09.361 --> 00:07:10.194
<v Speaker 1>description of reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a much more difficult question </v>

104
00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:16.230
<v Speaker 1>and it's partly a matter of definition </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>

105
00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:19.263
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the case that there are different </v>

106
00:07:20.501 --> 00:07:22.420
<v Speaker 1>forms of geometry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might know this,</v>

107
00:07:22.421 --> 00:07:23.254
<v Speaker 1>you can start from the presupposition </v>
<v Speaker 1>that reality has a three dimensional </v>

108
00:07:27.071 --> 00:07:31.060
<v Speaker 1>structure and then you're basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>within the realm of Euclidean geometry.</v>

109
00:07:31.061 --> 00:07:31.894
<v Speaker 1>But you can also start with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>presupposition that reality has a four </v>

110
00:07:34.451 --> 00:07:35.284
<v Speaker 1>dimensional structure and that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>geometry was invented in the late 18 </v>

111
00:07:38.711 --> 00:07:39.544
<v Speaker 1>hundreds and it turned out to be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect geometry to describe the </v>

112
00:07:41.501 --> 00:07:42.334
<v Speaker 1>universe that Einstein conceptualized </v>
<v Speaker 1>when he came up with his great theories </v>

113
00:07:45.671 --> 00:07:48.460
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the second decade there abouts of the</v>

114
00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:49.473
<v Speaker 1>20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's interesting because you can </v>

115
00:07:51.371 --> 00:07:52.204
<v Speaker 1>start from different assumptions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>build tools on the basis of those </v>

116
00:07:55.241 --> 00:07:58.060
<v Speaker 1>assumptions and sometimes you find out </v>
<v Speaker 1>that those tools work very well.</v>

117
00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:58.903
<v Speaker 1>Indeed.</v>

118
00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:05.940
<v Speaker 1>Now it's not that easy to think of flaws</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the subjective experience,</v>

119
00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:12.470
<v Speaker 1>objective world conceptualization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly for,</v>

120
00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:17.560
<v Speaker 1>as for us as modern people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it forms the basis of so much of what we</v>

121
00:08:17.561 --> 00:08:19.660
<v Speaker 1>think that we just think about it as </v>
<v Speaker 1>axiomatic.</v>

122
00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.480
<v Speaker 1>It's just true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't bear any question,</v>

123
00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:23.553
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to offer you a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>examples of why it might bear some </v>

124
00:08:27.161 --> 00:08:30.430
<v Speaker 1>questioning and you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can think about,</v>

125
00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:31.353
<v Speaker 1>you can think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first problem is is that the </v>

126
00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:40.540
<v Speaker 1>classical scientific view of the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>has a very difficult time accounting for</v>

127
00:08:40.541 --> 00:08:42.010
<v Speaker 1>certain things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

128
00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:43.353
<v Speaker 1>these are called quality a often by </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who were interested in </v>

129
00:08:45.761 --> 00:08:46.594
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So knowing the wavelength of light </v>

130
00:08:49.631 --> 00:08:53.080
<v Speaker 1>doesn't seem to tell you much about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>subjective experience of color.</v>

131
00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:56.100
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we experienced for example,</v>

132
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:58.410
<v Speaker 1>in a non continuous fashion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

133
00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:01.230
<v Speaker 1>Cause we see discrete colors like you'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>see in a rainbolt.</v>

134
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:03.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean they shade into each other to </v>
<v Speaker 1>some degree,</v>

135
00:09:03.271 --> 00:09:06.360
<v Speaker 1>but it's not like they go from light red</v>
<v Speaker 1>to dark red in the continuum.</v>

136
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:07.463
<v Speaker 1>There's clear demarcations of color.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While that's because of the way your </v>

137
00:09:11.251 --> 00:09:13.320
<v Speaker 1>brain is wired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

138
00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:15.780
<v Speaker 1>it seems like over the course of </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolution,</v>

139
00:09:15.781 --> 00:09:16.614
<v Speaker 1>what we've learned is that parsing up </v>
<v Speaker 1>that wavelength fragment in terms of </v>

140
00:09:20.101 --> 00:09:20.934
<v Speaker 1>categories which would be the different </v>
<v Speaker 1>colors that we see has substantial </v>

141
00:09:23.791 --> 00:09:24.624
<v Speaker 1>practical utility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what are the things you might ask </v>

142
00:09:26.281 --> 00:09:26.791
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

143
00:09:26.791 --> 00:09:29.880
<v Speaker 1>do those colors exist?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

144
00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:33.810
<v Speaker 1>objectively they don't seem to exist as </v>
<v Speaker 1>colors.</v>

145
00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:36.570
<v Speaker 1>Partly because of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wavelengths that we see are actually</v>

146
00:09:36.571 --> 00:09:39.870
<v Speaker 1>continuous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when one color shades into another,</v>

147
00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:43.500
<v Speaker 1>there's no radical transformation in </v>
<v Speaker 1>wave lake length.</v>

148
00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:45.960
<v Speaker 1>It's a continuum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we see it categorically.</v>

149
00:09:45.961 --> 00:09:47.340
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so is that real or not?</v>

150
00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:50.490
<v Speaker 1>Or The colors we see real or not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

151
00:09:50.491 --> 00:09:53.190
<v Speaker 1>that's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

152
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:56.760
<v Speaker 1>you can't get a collective experience of</v>
<v Speaker 1>pain.</v>

153
00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:59.580
<v Speaker 1>Like you can get a collective experience</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the blackboard,</v>

154
00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:03.810
<v Speaker 1>but pain seems to be something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>limited to subjective perception,</v>

155
00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:09.120
<v Speaker 1>but it's very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one acts as if pain isn't real.</v>

156
00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:11.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that</v>

157
00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:15.630
<v Speaker 1>of all the things that you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>consider real,</v>

158
00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:18.900
<v Speaker 1>we act as if pain is the most real </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

159
00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:20.910
<v Speaker 1>You certainly can't argue yourself out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>

160
00:10:20.911 --> 00:10:21.744
<v Speaker 1>For example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like a fundamental element of </v>

161
00:10:24.121 --> 00:10:25.620
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

162
00:10:25.621 --> 00:10:26.454
<v Speaker 1>so that's two places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We also have no account in the </v>

163
00:10:28.741 --> 00:10:30.030
<v Speaker 1>subjective objective,</v>

164
00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:33.533
<v Speaker 1>what breakup bifurcation of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have no explanation whatsoever for </v>

165
00:10:37.601 --> 00:10:40.600
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems like a big problem,</v>

166
00:10:40.601 --> 00:10:41.434
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you could make a case that </v>

167
00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:45.573
<v Speaker 1>there's no being without consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like is there something if there's no </v>

168
00:10:48.641 --> 00:10:49.960
<v Speaker 1>one there to perceive it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

169
00:10:49.961 --> 00:10:50.794
<v Speaker 1>that is not the same question as if a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tree falls in the forest and there's no </v>

170
00:10:53.921 --> 00:10:55.390
<v Speaker 1>one there to hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it make a sound?</v>

171
00:10:55.391 --> 00:10:59.350
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds superficially the same,</v>

172
00:10:59.351 --> 00:11:01.690
<v Speaker 1>but this is a much more complex question</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we don't know.</v>

173
00:11:01.691 --> 00:11:02.524
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we don't know the relationship </v>

174
00:11:05.801 --> 00:11:06.634
<v Speaker 1>between time and consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we have a certain perception of </v>

175
00:11:10.091 --> 00:11:10.924
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a certain temporal realm within </v>

176
00:11:12.941 --> 00:11:13.774
<v Speaker 1>which we exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our refresh rate for our vision for </v>

177
00:11:16.001 --> 00:11:17.590
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is about 60 hertz,</v>

178
00:11:17.591 --> 00:11:21.430
<v Speaker 1>which is why you can see computer </v>
<v Speaker 1>screens flicker or if they have a reflex</v>

179
00:11:21.431 --> 00:11:22.540
<v Speaker 1>rate that's slower than that.</v>

180
00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:26.860
<v Speaker 1>So 60 hertz to us looks continuous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

181
00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:30.730
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of microseconds in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>second for a computer,</v>

182
00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:31.593
<v Speaker 1>especially a fast process it computer </v>
<v Speaker 1>that can do maybe a trillion operations </v>

183
00:11:34.391 --> 00:11:38.920
<v Speaker 1>per second if it was watching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak a movie,</v>

184
00:11:38.921 --> 00:11:39.754
<v Speaker 1>it would just see a picture still </v>
<v Speaker 1>picture that was there forever and then </v>

185
00:11:43.391 --> 00:11:44.224
<v Speaker 1>another still picture that was there </v>
<v Speaker 1>forever and like it wouldn't have the </v>

186
00:11:46.661 --> 00:11:50.470
<v Speaker 1>impression of continuous movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's this weird subjective element</v>

187
00:11:50.471 --> 00:11:52.990
<v Speaker 1>to time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to understand.</v>

188
00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:54.223
<v Speaker 1>And then here's a more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a more complex criticism of the </v>

189
00:11:56.661 --> 00:11:57.960
<v Speaker 1>subject object idea.</v>

190
00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:00.853
<v Speaker 1>I thought about this for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the best example I know of it is I </v>

191
00:12:05.931 --> 00:12:06.764
<v Speaker 1>read this book a while back written by a</v>
<v Speaker 1>kgb officer and it was published after </v>

192
00:12:11.211 --> 00:12:12.540
<v Speaker 1>the fall of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

193
00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:16.490
<v Speaker 1>the wall and the Soviet Empire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this KGB officer claimed that he had</v>

194
00:12:16.491 --> 00:12:17.324
<v Speaker 1>worked in a biological warfare unit in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Soviet Union and the purpose of the </v>

195
00:12:21.201 --> 00:12:22.034
<v Speaker 1>biological warfare unit was to turn </v>
<v Speaker 1>infectious diseases into aerosols so </v>

196
00:12:27.381 --> 00:12:29.540
<v Speaker 1>that they can be sprayed on enemy </v>
<v Speaker 1>populations.</v>

197
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:33.050
<v Speaker 1>And so they were working on two things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>developing a very,</v>

198
00:12:33.051 --> 00:12:36.140
<v Speaker 1>very silent infection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're willing to infection is</v>

199
00:12:36.141 --> 00:12:36.974
<v Speaker 1>one that's very severe but also very </v>
<v Speaker 1>transmissible cause those things are </v>

200
00:12:40.221 --> 00:12:41.054
<v Speaker 1>separate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then also one that could survive </v>

201
00:12:42.861 --> 00:12:45.920
<v Speaker 1>being aerosolized because it turns out </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's quite difficult,</v>

202
00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:47.690
<v Speaker 1>which we should all be very thankful </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

203
00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.940
<v Speaker 1>And one of the projects they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>working on was uh,</v>

204
00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:54.650
<v Speaker 1>an attempt to cross Ebola with smallpox.</v>

205
00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:57.830
<v Speaker 1>Now he bulla is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you all know about Ebola,</v>

206
00:12:57.831 --> 00:13:00.560
<v Speaker 1>I presume it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>

207
00:13:00.561 --> 00:13:01.394
<v Speaker 1>very fatal although they've learned ways</v>
<v Speaker 1>to treat it now and maybe have a </v>

208
00:13:04.521 --> 00:13:06.380
<v Speaker 1>vaccine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at that time it was very,</v>

209
00:13:06.381 --> 00:13:10.760
<v Speaker 1>very fatal and a small smallpox is </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly contagious.</v>

210
00:13:10.761 --> 00:13:11.594
<v Speaker 1>And so they were hoping they could </v>
<v Speaker 1>develop something that you said it was </v>

211
00:13:13.701 --> 00:13:15.290
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very contagious and very,</v>

212
00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:20.300
<v Speaker 1>very deadly and that you could spray on </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilian populations.</v>

213
00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:23.000
<v Speaker 1>Now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

214
00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:27.080
<v Speaker 1>here's where it gets tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets tricky here because</v>

215
00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:29.473
<v Speaker 1>how you answered this question </v>
<v Speaker 1>inevitably lead inevitably depends on </v>

216
00:13:32.631 --> 00:13:33.464
<v Speaker 1>how you define truth and truth is </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually something you have to define </v>

217
00:13:37.671 --> 00:13:39.290
<v Speaker 1>before you can have a conversation about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

218
00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:44.680
<v Speaker 1>which is a kind of a strange thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>

219
00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:47.803
<v Speaker 1>You can make a case that determining how</v>
<v Speaker 1>to cross Ebola with small parks and </v>

220
00:13:52.281 --> 00:13:53.114
<v Speaker 1>aerosolize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a perfectly valid scientific </v>

221
00:13:56.451 --> 00:13:57.284
<v Speaker 1>question</v>

222
00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:01.053
<v Speaker 1>and because science is value free,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to make an argument </v>

223
00:14:03.251 --> 00:14:04.084
<v Speaker 1>that that's any worse experiment than </v>
<v Speaker 1>any other kind of experiment or any </v>

224
00:14:06.911 --> 00:14:09.280
<v Speaker 1>other kind of investigation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you could also imagine,</v>

225
00:14:09.281 --> 00:14:13.210
<v Speaker 1>even if you didn't go to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>aerosolization stage,</v>

226
00:14:13.211 --> 00:14:14.800
<v Speaker 1>that positive things might come out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

227
00:14:14.801 --> 00:14:15.634
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you'd end up with a more detailed </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding of DNA or something as a </v>

228
00:14:19.211 --> 00:14:22.180
<v Speaker 1>consequence of the investigation that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have positive consequences.</v>

229
00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:23.553
<v Speaker 1>But it still seems</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the idea of doing scientific </v>

230
00:14:30.791 --> 00:14:32.890
<v Speaker 1>research across Ebola,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smallpox,</v>

231
00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:35.380
<v Speaker 1>there seems to be something wrong about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

232
00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:37.743
<v Speaker 1>And it's maybe that sense of wrongness </v>
<v Speaker 1>as well that can't be captured with </v>

233
00:14:42.711 --> 00:14:44.950
<v Speaker 1>inside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inside scientific models.</v>

234
00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:46.413
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that you claimed him </v>

235
00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:54.390
<v Speaker 1>and Rogers and the is that in some sense</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the scientific reality has to be</v>

236
00:14:56.661 --> 00:15:00.920
<v Speaker 1>encapsulated within a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an ethical reality rather than the other</v>

237
00:15:00.921 --> 00:15:04.160
<v Speaker 1>way around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now Rogers would say,</v>

238
00:15:04.161 --> 00:15:04.994
<v Speaker 1>you know that feeling you have when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>hear about someone crossing Ebola with </v>

239
00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:10.550
<v Speaker 1>smallpox,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that feeling you have in your body,</v>

240
00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:13.363
<v Speaker 1>that's a real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That feeling and that that's part of </v>

241
00:15:16.401 --> 00:15:17.234
<v Speaker 1>being</v>

242
00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:19.473
<v Speaker 2>now</v>

243
00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:22.580
<v Speaker 1>for the phenomenologists being is </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>

244
00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:27.800
<v Speaker 1>it's complicated</v>
<v Speaker 1>to define and it's hard to understand,</v>

245
00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:29.853
<v Speaker 1>but what the phenomenologists do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we start with a different set of </v>

246
00:15:31.551 --> 00:15:32.384
<v Speaker 1>assumptions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't assume that the best way to </v>

247
00:15:35.691 --> 00:15:36.524
<v Speaker 1>approach reality is to break it up into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the subjective and the object they </v>

248
00:15:39.951 --> 00:15:40.784
<v Speaker 1>presume instead that the way that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should approach reality is by assuming </v>

249
00:15:43.671 --> 00:15:46.910
<v Speaker 1>that all of your experiences real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of it.</v>

250
00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:47.923
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean there are different </v>

251
00:15:48.291 --> 00:15:50.750
<v Speaker 1>categories of experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

252
00:15:50.751 --> 00:15:51.584
<v Speaker 1>because you could still say a dream and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the experience you have walked dreaming </v>

253
00:15:56.841 --> 00:15:57.674
<v Speaker 1>of walking down the street and walking </v>
<v Speaker 1>down the street are still different </v>

254
00:16:00.831 --> 00:16:02.960
<v Speaker 1>things and the phenomenologists would </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

255
00:16:02.961 --> 00:16:03.794
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can keep your categorical </v>

256
00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.193
<v Speaker 1>distinctions in tact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to say that they're both </v>

257
00:16:08.841 --> 00:16:09.674
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>

258
00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:11.623
<v Speaker 2>Now</v>

259
00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:12.613
<v Speaker 1>this is an assumption and I told you why</v>
<v Speaker 1>the assumptions generating part of the </v>

260
00:16:15.921 --> 00:16:16.754
<v Speaker 1>reason the assumption has generated the </v>
<v Speaker 1>alternative assumption is because there </v>

261
00:16:19.641 --> 00:16:20.474
<v Speaker 1>are problems that emerge with the set of</v>
<v Speaker 1>assumptions that make up the scientific </v>

262
00:16:25.371 --> 00:16:26.030
<v Speaker 1>worldview.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

263
00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:30.020
<v Speaker 1>it's not that surprising that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific worldview can't encompass the</v>

264
00:16:30.021 --> 00:16:34.790
<v Speaker 1>subjective because the scientific world </v>
<v Speaker 1>view was actually established by,</v>

265
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:35.863
<v Speaker 1>by Bacon and descartes safe and by well </v>
<v Speaker 1>by other thinkers of that time it was </v>

266
00:16:42.291 --> 00:16:43.124
<v Speaker 1>set up to exclude the subjective from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the conceptualization of objective </v>

267
00:16:47.541 --> 00:16:48.374
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can't really criticize science </v>

268
00:16:49.521 --> 00:16:50.354
<v Speaker 1>because he does that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can say the fact that this </v>

269
00:16:52.971 --> 00:16:57.971
<v Speaker 1>objective is excluded is a fault or at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least an incompleteness.</v>

270
00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:01.850
<v Speaker 1>And that incompleteness sometimes has </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary,</v>

271
00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:03.013
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily serious consequences </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can't just dismiss because you </v>

272
00:17:07.131 --> 00:17:07.731
<v Speaker 1>might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

273
00:17:07.731 --> 00:17:08.564
<v Speaker 1>had the Russians being the Soviet being </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful in crossing Ebola with small </v>

274
00:17:13.601 --> 00:17:16.640
<v Speaker 1>pox and aerosolizing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we might all be dead.</v>

275
00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:17.863
<v Speaker 1>And then you might think that any theory</v>
<v Speaker 1>that leads everyone to be dead might </v>

276
00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:27.850
<v Speaker 1>reasonably crypt be criticized for its </v>
<v Speaker 1>assumption to universal truth.</v>

277
00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:31.880
<v Speaker 1>Now you can debate that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

278
00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:33.500
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and rightly so,</v>

279
00:17:33.501 --> 00:17:34.334
<v Speaker 1>but all I'm pointing out is there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons to go at this from another </v>

280
00:17:37.101 --> 00:17:37.934
<v Speaker 1>approach.</v>

281
00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:42.830
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was Roger's basic assumption that,</v>

282
00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:46.230
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

283
00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:47.063
<v Speaker 1>you are more likely to be properly </v>
<v Speaker 1>oriented in life if you adopted a </v>

284
00:17:50.791 --> 00:17:51.624
<v Speaker 1>phenomenal logical approach to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience and to break up reality in </v>

285
00:17:57.991 --> 00:18:00.030
<v Speaker 1>that manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let me give you an example.</v>

286
00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:06.230
<v Speaker 1>When I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when my daughter was about three,</v>

287
00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:09.440
<v Speaker 1>she have nightmare and she came running </v>
<v Speaker 1>into</v>

288
00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:13.393
<v Speaker 1>her parent's bedroom and</v>
<v Speaker 1>she told me her dream and she was all </v>

289
00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:20.203
<v Speaker 1>upset by it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She might've even been younger than </v>

290
00:18:21.501 --> 00:18:22.334
<v Speaker 1>three at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had she and dreamed that there was a </v>

291
00:18:24.651 --> 00:18:25.484
<v Speaker 1>clear stream and that it was quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful and that there was garbage </v>

292
00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:33.650
<v Speaker 1>littering the bottom of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now by that time,</v>

293
00:18:33.651 --> 00:18:34.484
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she kids are quite sophisticated in </v>

294
00:18:35.871 --> 00:18:37.520
<v Speaker 1>their ability to categorize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

295
00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:41.480
<v Speaker 1>by that time she'd already learned the </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference between kid and adult things.</v>

296
00:18:41.481 --> 00:18:45.440
<v Speaker 1>And you think that's a bloody complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>form of discrimination,</v>

297
00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:46.303
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because like what objective features do </v>

298
00:18:48.801 --> 00:18:52.850
<v Speaker 1>adult things sharing common that </v>
<v Speaker 1>differentiates them from kid things?</v>

299
00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:54.860
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't actually come up with a set of</v>

300
00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:57.710
<v Speaker 1>objective criteria that allows that </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinction to be made.</v>

301
00:18:57.950 --> 00:18:59.390
<v Speaker 1>But kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the time they're three years,</v>

302
00:18:59.391 --> 00:19:00.224
<v Speaker 1>got a pretty clear grasp of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they can come up with very </v>

303
00:19:02.841 --> 00:19:05.300
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated classifications,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

304
00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:06.210
<v Speaker 1>about the same time.</v>

305
00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:11.210
<v Speaker 1>But one of my friends had a two year old</v>
<v Speaker 1>who went outside their house one day and</v>

306
00:19:12.051 --> 00:19:12.884
<v Speaker 1>look down the street and there were a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of garbage cans knocked over and </v>

307
00:19:14.931 --> 00:19:16.040
<v Speaker 1>the kid said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

308
00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:19.520
<v Speaker 1>and you know that's also extremely </v>
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated because you think,</v>

309
00:19:19.521 --> 00:19:24.521
<v Speaker 1>you know the a whole street is a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex visual set of visual stimuli.</v>

310
00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:25.813
<v Speaker 1>And to be able to glance at that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then to know that something is out of </v>

311
00:19:28.641 --> 00:19:32.540
<v Speaker 1>place and then to make an utterance </v>
<v Speaker 1>solid to draw people's attention to it,</v>

312
00:19:32.541 --> 00:19:36.020
<v Speaker 1>is it ridiculously sophisticated </v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitive out?</v>

313
00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:39.800
<v Speaker 1>And my daughter was doing the same thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>within the context of her dream.</v>

314
00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:43.930
<v Speaker 1>So she was upset about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's quite interesting because you'd</v>

315
00:19:43.931 --> 00:19:44.600
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

316
00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:49.600
<v Speaker 1>why would someone who was three be upset</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the fact that a stream beautiful,</v>

317
00:19:50.601 --> 00:19:53.090
<v Speaker 1>clear stream was but had garbage in it?</v>

318
00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:53.780
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

319
00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:54.613
<v Speaker 1>it's a really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like innate environmentalism or </v>

320
00:19:57.711 --> 00:19:59.960
<v Speaker 1>something like that and concerned for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the environment.</v>

321
00:19:59.961 --> 00:20:01.730
<v Speaker 1>And that could easily be the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

322
00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:04.213
<v Speaker 1>If we followed our environment up </v>
<v Speaker 1>continually during our evolutionary </v>

323
00:20:07.131 --> 00:20:09.800
<v Speaker 1>history that was likely to have very </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative consequences.</v>

324
00:20:09.801 --> 00:20:10.634
<v Speaker 1>Even birds clean their own nest and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>do with bees and you know they keep </v>

325
00:20:13.221 --> 00:20:14.054
<v Speaker 1>their hives clean and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it could be a very primordial </v>

326
00:20:16.731 --> 00:20:19.000
<v Speaker 1>instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

327
00:20:19.001 --> 00:20:22.370
<v Speaker 1>she came in with the stream and she was </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite upset and then you think,</v>

328
00:20:22.371 --> 00:20:24.290
<v Speaker 1>well there's a couple of things you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could do about that.</v>

329
00:20:24.291 --> 00:20:29.150
<v Speaker 1>You could say it's just a dream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't worry about it,</v>

330
00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:30.650
<v Speaker 1>go back to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

331
00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:32.750
<v Speaker 1>that's a philosophical statement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

332
00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:34.623
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

333
00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:35.613
<v Speaker 1>it's a misleading one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or You could argue that it was </v>

334
00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:42.080
<v Speaker 1>misleading one because what does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a dream mean.</v>

335
00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:46.760
<v Speaker 1>Well it means that it's certainly not </v>
<v Speaker 1>something to take.</v>

336
00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:50.050
<v Speaker 1>Like you would take serious take </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that occurred during the day.</v>

337
00:20:50.051 --> 00:20:54.580
<v Speaker 1>Seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a mirror like a fantasy.</v>

338
00:20:55.620 --> 00:21:00.620
<v Speaker 1>But with the definition of fantasy being</v>
<v Speaker 1>some fundamentally useless</v>

339
00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:06.423
<v Speaker 1>act of what the play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose that you can ignore with no </v>

340
00:21:11.741 --> 00:21:13.060
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And not only that,</v>

341
00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:15.670
<v Speaker 1>but you should ignore it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

342
00:21:15.671 --> 00:21:19.690
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not necessarily true because</v>

343
00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:22.563
<v Speaker 1>then you're making the case or you might</v>
<v Speaker 1>be making the case that you don't have </v>

344
00:21:25.571 --> 00:21:27.790
<v Speaker 1>to pay attention to products of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagination.</v>

345
00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:31.310
<v Speaker 1>That seems like a pretty dopey thing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell a child given a,</v>

346
00:21:31.311 --> 00:21:32.144
<v Speaker 1>that anything creative that you ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>produced is going to come out of your </v>

347
00:21:34.691 --> 00:21:35.524
<v Speaker 1>imagination and be the way that you set </v>
<v Speaker 1>goals and plans for your future is by </v>

348
00:21:39.881 --> 00:21:42.310
<v Speaker 1>imagining them dreaming about them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

349
00:21:42.311 --> 00:21:44.500
<v Speaker 1>Everyone knows what it means to pursue a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dream.</v>

350
00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:46.240
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>

351
00:21:46.241 --> 00:21:47.110
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're depressed,</v>

352
00:21:47.111 --> 00:21:49.270
<v Speaker 1>it means all your dreams have </v>
<v Speaker 1>disappeared.</v>

353
00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:50.493
<v Speaker 1>It's like so maybe you shouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 1>telling your child that it's just a </v>

354
00:21:54.851 --> 00:21:57.460
<v Speaker 1>dream and so you can go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can ignore it and go back to sleep.</v>

355
00:21:57.580 --> 00:21:59.920
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know exactly what you're doing</v>

356
00:21:59.921 --> 00:22:01.300
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you do that,</v>

357
00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:05.630
<v Speaker 1>you're certainly not paying attention to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the child's experience because it's,</v>

358
00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:08.980
<v Speaker 1>she did have that image you had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It did make her upset.</v>

359
00:22:08.981 --> 00:22:09.814
<v Speaker 1>And those are facts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as far as people like Rogers would </v>

360
00:22:12.041 --> 00:22:14.050
<v Speaker 1>be concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are facts about reality.</v>

361
00:22:14.051 --> 00:22:17.710
<v Speaker 1>Are there elements of reality?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they should be dealt with as such.</v>

362
00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:20.343
<v Speaker 1>So I told her to close her eyes and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>bring the dream image at inner </v>

363
00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:28.390
<v Speaker 1>imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which she could do very well.</v>

364
00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:30.453
<v Speaker 1>And then to imagine that she had some </v>
<v Speaker 1>rubber boots on and that she could go </v>

365
00:22:34.421 --> 00:22:35.254
<v Speaker 1>into the stream and pick out the garbage</v>
<v Speaker 1>and put it in the garbage bag and that </v>

366
00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:40.750
<v Speaker 1>there was a garbage can nearby and she </v>
<v Speaker 1>could put it in the garbage can.</v>

367
00:22:40.751 --> 00:22:41.584
<v Speaker 1>And so we went through that and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>calmed her down and then she went back </v>

368
00:22:45.431 --> 00:22:46.264
<v Speaker 1>to bed.</v>

369
00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:47.590
<v Speaker 1>And then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

370
00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:52.900
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What am I doing doing that?</v>

371
00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:54.671
<v Speaker 1>Because you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

372
00:22:54.671 --> 00:22:56.530
<v Speaker 1>that's just a fantasy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like the dream.</v>

373
00:22:56.531 --> 00:22:59.410
<v Speaker 1>And because they're just fantasies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neither of them have anything to do with</v>

374
00:22:59.411 --> 00:23:02.440
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know that again,</v>

375
00:23:02.441 --> 00:23:03.274
<v Speaker 1>that's not very sophisticated way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking because the dream presented my </v>

376
00:23:06.041 --> 00:23:06.874
<v Speaker 1>daughter with a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or You could even say a class of </v>

377
00:23:08.561 --> 00:23:09.394
<v Speaker 1>problems and the class of problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it includes all of those things that </v>

378
00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:17.530
<v Speaker 1>people do too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I and other animals,</v>

379
00:23:17.531 --> 00:23:20.080
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the ways that the environment can be</v>

380
00:23:20.081 --> 00:23:20.914
<v Speaker 1>defiled.</v>

381
00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:25.120
<v Speaker 1>Well that actually is an existential </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

382
00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:27.820
<v Speaker 1>And then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

383
00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:31.150
<v Speaker 1>what should you do about it now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that might be,</v>

384
00:23:31.151 --> 00:23:31.984
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you should do something about it </v>

385
00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:35.170
<v Speaker 1>in so far as you can do something about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

386
00:23:35.171 --> 00:23:39.700
<v Speaker 1>because then you're conceptualizing </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself as an active agent and not just</v>

387
00:23:39.701 --> 00:23:44.050
<v Speaker 1>a passive victim or a passive recipient </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the problem.</v>

388
00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:48.110
<v Speaker 1>You could actually do something about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a way different messages.</v>

389
00:23:48.111 --> 00:23:51.380
<v Speaker 1>Then it's just a dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can ignore it and go back to sleep.</v>

390
00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:54.050
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've maybe you shouldn't actually tell</v>

391
00:23:54.051 --> 00:23:56.360
<v Speaker 1>your child to be ignoring reality and go</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to sleep.</v>

392
00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:57.553
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you should be telling them to wake</v>
<v Speaker 1>up and see reality as clearly as they </v>

393
00:24:00.291 --> 00:24:01.124
<v Speaker 1>possibly can and not ignore any of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including their fantasies in their </v>

394
00:24:05.091 --> 00:24:05.924
<v Speaker 1>dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that doesn't mean that they're </v>

395
00:24:06.801 --> 00:24:07.634
<v Speaker 1>fantasies have the same reality as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality that you experience with </v>

396
00:24:11.121 --> 00:24:11.954
<v Speaker 1>everyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the fact that it's not the same </v>

397
00:24:14.931 --> 00:24:15.764
<v Speaker 1>reality that you experienced with </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone else doesn't mean it's not </v>

398
00:24:17.961 --> 00:24:21.650
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now Rogers would claim for example,</v>

399
00:24:21.651 --> 00:24:26.651
<v Speaker 1>that to ignore a private experience,</v>

400
00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:29.693
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

401
00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:31.990
<v Speaker 1>warps you fundamentally.</v>

402
00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:34.723
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

403
00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:37.730
<v Speaker 1>here's the basic outlines of his view of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

404
00:24:37.731 --> 00:24:38.960
<v Speaker 1>So there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's first of all,</v>

405
00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:43.520
<v Speaker 1>you exist within a phenomenological </v>
<v Speaker 1>field now phenomenon,</v>

406
00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:44.703
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon and comes from the Greek word</v>
<v Speaker 1>famous thigh and famous thigh means to </v>

407
00:24:48.531 --> 00:24:49.364
<v Speaker 1>shine forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so phenomena are those things that </v>

408
00:24:53.181 --> 00:24:54.014
<v Speaker 1>shine forth for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the way to understand that is to </v>

409
00:24:58.191 --> 00:25:03.191
<v Speaker 1>imagine that you're reading a book and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a passage of it really strikes you</v>

410
00:25:04.251 --> 00:25:06.470
<v Speaker 1>as meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then you might say,</v>

411
00:25:06.471 --> 00:25:08.600
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

412
00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:11.960
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of passages in the book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If someone else was reading the book,</v>

413
00:25:11.961 --> 00:25:16.220
<v Speaker 1>it's not obvious that the same passage </v>
<v Speaker 1>would strike them.</v>

414
00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:18.140
<v Speaker 1>And then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

415
00:25:18.141 --> 00:25:20.650
<v Speaker 1>is that a consequence of the structure </v>
<v Speaker 1>of you as as a,</v>

416
00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:23.300
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an interpreter of the book?</v>

417
00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:25.700
<v Speaker 1>Or is it a consequence of the contents </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the book?</v>

418
00:25:25.701 --> 00:25:28.100
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is you actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't tell because</v>

419
00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:32.810
<v Speaker 1>the book is neither the thing that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>printed nor the reader.</v>

420
00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:37.220
<v Speaker 1>The book is the interaction between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reader and and the book.</v>

421
00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:40.160
<v Speaker 1>And that interaction is actually unique </v>
<v Speaker 1>for each person,</v>

422
00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:41.203
<v Speaker 1>even though there might be some </v>
<v Speaker 1>commonalities across people because </v>

423
00:25:43.101 --> 00:25:44.960
<v Speaker 1>otherwise he wouldn't even be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about a book.</v>

424
00:25:46.890 --> 00:25:47.723
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

425
00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:53.770
<v Speaker 1>regardless when you're interacting with </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

426
00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:54.783
<v Speaker 1>some things announced themselves on your</v>
<v Speaker 1>field of consciousness and other things </v>

427
00:25:58.601 --> 00:26:01.450
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the phenomenologists would say,</v>

428
00:26:01.451 --> 00:26:03.970
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some things shine forth for you.</v>

429
00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:05.560
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other things don't.</v>

430
00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:07.683
<v Speaker 1>It's a little bit like</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of Ewing's ideas about the </v>

431
00:26:12.611 --> 00:26:16.000
<v Speaker 1>development of the self.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't believe that</v>

432
00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:21.340
<v Speaker 1>if you follow the things that announced </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves to you as meaningful,</v>

433
00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:23.343
<v Speaker 1>that they would take you through a </v>
<v Speaker 1>descent to begin with where you would </v>

434
00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:31.780
<v Speaker 1>encounter things you were afraid of or </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrified of and disgusted by and wanted</v>

435
00:26:31.781 --> 00:26:32.614
<v Speaker 1>to avoid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the consequences of that would </v>

436
00:26:34.781 --> 00:26:37.960
<v Speaker 1>be that you did incorporate a lot of new</v>
<v Speaker 1>material into your personality.</v>

437
00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:38.973
<v Speaker 1>And the consequence of that would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be reborn roughly speaking as a </v>

438
00:26:41.981 --> 00:26:44.970
<v Speaker 1>stronger person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if you just kept doing that all</v>

439
00:26:44.971 --> 00:26:45.804
<v Speaker 1>the time for the rest of your life in </v>
<v Speaker 1>small and large ways that you'd become </v>

440
00:26:48.391 --> 00:26:51.930
<v Speaker 1>more and more and more fully </v>
<v Speaker 1>differentiated and developed.</v>

441
00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:53.183
<v Speaker 1>And he would have said that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ultimate potential target of that </v>

442
00:26:57.331 --> 00:27:01.180
<v Speaker 1>kind of development was what he </v>
<v Speaker 1>described as the self.</v>

443
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.000
<v Speaker 1>The south is a multifaceted</v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualization,</v>

444
00:27:07.461 --> 00:27:08.294
<v Speaker 1>so that's not all there is to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the self from the union perspective </v>

445
00:27:11.061 --> 00:27:14.780
<v Speaker 1>is who you could be if you could be who </v>
<v Speaker 1>you most deeply are.</v>

446
00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:17.480
<v Speaker 1>If you didn't shy away from anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

447
00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:22.930
<v Speaker 1>if you accurately encountered and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>integrated,</v>

448
00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:25.910
<v Speaker 1>even in a phd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rdm sense your experience.</v>

449
00:27:25.911 --> 00:27:28.280
<v Speaker 1>Now that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly the same idea that Rogers</v>

450
00:27:28.281 --> 00:27:30.830
<v Speaker 1>had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He believed that</v>

451
00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:35.910
<v Speaker 1>there's a phenomenal field and it's full</v>
<v Speaker 1>of experience.</v>

452
00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:37.103
<v Speaker 1>All of your experience manifests itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>as the phenomenal field is quite </v>

453
00:27:40.651 --> 00:27:41.484
<v Speaker 1>interesting because if it means also </v>
<v Speaker 1>that other people are part of your </v>

454
00:27:43.621 --> 00:27:46.140
<v Speaker 1>phenomenal field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of your experience,</v>

455
00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:48.323
<v Speaker 1>and then that within that field there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>a circumscribed area that he described </v>

456
00:27:53.941 --> 00:27:56.490
<v Speaker 1>as the self that's different than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>union itself.</v>

457
00:27:56.491 --> 00:27:59.250
<v Speaker 1>So it's somewhat terminal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>logically confusing.</v>

458
00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:00.683
<v Speaker 1>Rogers self is more like Freud's ego,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but rogers would define the self as </v>

459
00:28:05.551 --> 00:28:09.120
<v Speaker 1>those aspects of the phenomenal logical </v>
<v Speaker 1>field that you,</v>

460
00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:14.760
<v Speaker 1>that you call I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt like</v>

461
00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:21.800
<v Speaker 1>I've had clients who tended to talk in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the third person about their emotions or</v>

462
00:28:23.551 --> 00:28:24.384
<v Speaker 1>they would say the body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't say I maybe they're </v>

463
00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:29.760
<v Speaker 1>describing cutting themselves and they'd</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

464
00:28:29.761 --> 00:28:34.760
<v Speaker 1>well</v>
<v Speaker 1>the body needed to be cut.</v>

465
00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:36.933
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

466
00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:40.080
<v Speaker 1>what Rogers would say about that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>that</v>

467
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:44.263
<v Speaker 1>person existed in the phenomenological </v>
<v Speaker 1>field and part of that phenomenal </v>

468
00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:50.090
<v Speaker 1>logical field was demarcated by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>self,</v>

469
00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:51.433
<v Speaker 1>but the self hadn't expanded to </v>
<v Speaker 1>incorporate as much of that </v>

470
00:28:54.201 --> 00:28:56.270
<v Speaker 1>phenomenological field as it should </v>
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

471
00:28:57.770 --> 00:28:58.603
<v Speaker 1>The other concept he had was the con.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another concept he had was the concept </v>

472
00:29:01.401 --> 00:29:02.234
<v Speaker 1>of the organism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you could think of the self as what </v>

473
00:29:06.681 --> 00:29:07.514
<v Speaker 1>you identify with it and then you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>think of the organism as all those </v>

474
00:29:11.961 --> 00:29:15.380
<v Speaker 1>things that are unique to you that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>might identify with the eye.</v>

475
00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:16.873
<v Speaker 1>Now it's tricky because imagine that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>get angry during the fight with some </v>

476
00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:23.240
<v Speaker 1>argument and they say you're angry and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

477
00:29:23.241 --> 00:29:25.060
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not lost.</v>

478
00:29:25.090 --> 00:29:27.020
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what exactly are you doing there?</v>

479
00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:28.183
<v Speaker 1>The other person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to assume the other person </v>

480
00:29:29.281 --> 00:29:33.890
<v Speaker 1>is right for the sake of this argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can clearly see that you're angry,</v>

481
00:29:33.891 --> 00:29:35.510
<v Speaker 1>but you're not</v>

482
00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:37.913
<v Speaker 2>allowing</v>

483
00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:40.033
<v Speaker 1>the organism organismic manifestation of</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivational state or emotion to be </v>

484
00:29:44.261 --> 00:29:47.530
<v Speaker 1>incorporated with those things that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>identify with.</v>

485
00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:50.563
<v Speaker 1>Rogers would call that in grows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he believed that in congruence was </v>

486
00:29:58.521 --> 00:30:03.521
<v Speaker 1>roughly equivalent to psychopathology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that part of your goal was to,</v>

487
00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:09.053
<v Speaker 1>was for the organism to respond </v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriately to the broader </v>

488
00:30:15.301 --> 00:30:18.840
<v Speaker 1>phenomenological field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we can talk about what appropriately</v>

489
00:30:18.841 --> 00:30:20.310
<v Speaker 1>means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we won't do that yet.</v>

490
00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:24.900
<v Speaker 1>And then what the south was supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do was accurately symbolically represent</v>

491
00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:28.590
<v Speaker 1>organismic responses to the broader </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenological field.</v>

492
00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:30.803
<v Speaker 1>So now you can see that there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>similarities between that concept and </v>

493
00:30:34.801 --> 00:30:38.130
<v Speaker 1>say Freud's idea of the ego and the ID.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

494
00:30:38.131 --> 00:30:38.964
<v Speaker 1>cause the Ed was this sort of external </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and that was the home of </v>

495
00:30:42.301 --> 00:30:46.230
<v Speaker 1>motivational land,</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional forces that couldn't be easily</v>

496
00:30:46.231 --> 00:30:51.231
<v Speaker 1>integrated into the ego and for partly </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the Superego said,</v>

497
00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:53.280
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they were wrong.</v>

498
00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:56.310
<v Speaker 1>And so there is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these sets of phenomena you know,</v>

499
00:30:56.311 --> 00:30:59.100
<v Speaker 1>that all of the different clinicians are</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about,</v>

500
00:30:59.101 --> 00:30:59.934
<v Speaker 1>but all of them are talking about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>starting from different initial </v>

501
00:31:02.221 --> 00:31:03.054
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions and it's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a group of people in the room shining a </v>

502
00:31:06.901 --> 00:31:08.940
<v Speaker 1>flashlight on a very complex object.</v>

503
00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:09.773
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all standing in a slightly </v>

504
00:31:10.261 --> 00:31:12.960
<v Speaker 1>different position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The complex object is the same thing,</v>

505
00:31:12.961 --> 00:31:13.794
<v Speaker 1>but you can only see parts of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you need both couple different </v>

506
00:31:16.411 --> 00:31:21.411
<v Speaker 1>ways of looking at things so that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can come up with a cohesive and coherent</v>

507
00:31:21.421 --> 00:31:24.090
<v Speaker 1>account of something that's actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond your understanding.</v>

508
00:31:24.091 --> 00:31:24.924
<v Speaker 1>Because of course not only kit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you not accurately symbolically </v>

509
00:31:29.521 --> 00:31:34.521
<v Speaker 1>represent the phenomenal logical world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the entire domain of your being.</v>

510
00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:39.930
<v Speaker 1>You can't accurately represent even the </v>
<v Speaker 1>organismic,</v>

511
00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:44.640
<v Speaker 1>the aspect of that field that's related </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the organismic you.</v>

512
00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:49.020
<v Speaker 1>There's this part of you on top that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>identify with,</v>

513
00:31:49.021 --> 00:31:49.854
<v Speaker 1>I roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's trying to model a mortal of </v>

514
00:31:53.881 --> 00:31:54.714
<v Speaker 1>something very complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course that's extraordinarily </v>

515
00:31:56.611 --> 00:31:59.040
<v Speaker 1>difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now why is it doing that?</v>

516
00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:04.570
<v Speaker 1>That's the central mystery of </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

517
00:32:04.571 --> 00:32:05.404
<v Speaker 1>You know there's this problem that </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness researchers always </v>

518
00:32:09.221 --> 00:32:11.800
<v Speaker 1>referred to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an annoyingly termed,</v>

519
00:32:11.801 --> 00:32:12.634
<v Speaker 1>I think it's called the Zombie problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Zombie problem is the why is </v>

520
00:32:17.831 --> 00:32:18.664
<v Speaker 1>consciousness unnecessary?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like why is it necessary for something </v>

521
00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:27.970
<v Speaker 1>complex like a human being to actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>have awareness and self awareness?</v>

522
00:32:27.971 --> 00:32:28.804
<v Speaker 1>Why couldn't it just wander through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world reacting in predetermined </v>

523
00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:37.980
<v Speaker 1>deterministic fashion?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zombie like no awareness robot.</v>

524
00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:41.450
<v Speaker 1>Like let's say what's consciousness for</v>

525
00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:49.410
<v Speaker 1>Rogers doesn't really discuss that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we won't at the moment,</v>

526
00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:51.930
<v Speaker 1>although I think there are some </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable ideas.</v>

527
00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:56.110
<v Speaker 1>Consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

528
00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:59.700
<v Speaker 1>I was used to generalize between certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomena anyways,</v>

529
00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:03.840
<v Speaker 1>regardless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the self,</v>

530
00:33:03.841 --> 00:33:06.150
<v Speaker 1>the organism in the broader </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenological field.</v>

531
00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:14.490
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you go into a</v>

532
00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:16.640
<v Speaker 2>pub bar</v>

533
00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:19.283
<v Speaker 1>and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've been there many times and so you </v>

534
00:33:21.931 --> 00:33:23.610
<v Speaker 1>know the people in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know where to sit,</v>

535
00:33:23.790 --> 00:33:26.190
<v Speaker 1>you know what's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You met friends there.</v>

536
00:33:26.610 --> 00:33:28.980
<v Speaker 1>You might say that your organism</v>

537
00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:31.110
<v Speaker 2>exists</v>

538
00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:35.190
<v Speaker 1>at least in part as a very accurate </v>
<v Speaker 1>model of that broader,</v>

539
00:33:35.191 --> 00:33:36.360
<v Speaker 1>phenomenal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>logical world.</v>

540
00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:42.440
<v Speaker 1>And then inside that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're aware of your knowledge,</v>

541
00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:47.390
<v Speaker 2>the bar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so</v>

542
00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:54.250
<v Speaker 1>if your organism is properly adapted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the broader phenomenological field,</v>

543
00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:58.600
<v Speaker 1>when you go into the bar or other </v>
<v Speaker 1>familiar place,</v>

544
00:33:58.960 --> 00:33:59.793
<v Speaker 1>things that you expect and want happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of things that you neither </v>

545
00:34:04.111 --> 00:34:06.040
<v Speaker 1>expect nor one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you could say,</v>

546
00:34:06.041 --> 00:34:10.630
<v Speaker 1>well perhaps that's a reasonable</v>
<v Speaker 1>definition of adaptation though.</v>

547
00:34:10.631 --> 00:34:13.510
<v Speaker 1>This isn't biological or evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 1>adaptation,</v>

548
00:34:13.511 --> 00:34:16.370
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is personal lab application there.</v>

549
00:34:16.670 --> 00:34:19.510
<v Speaker 1>They're similar in some ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but importantly different.</v>

550
00:34:21.090 --> 00:34:21.923
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can be adapted to an </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment without that in any way </v>

551
00:34:24.251 --> 00:34:27.280
<v Speaker 1>having any effect whatsoever on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary adaptiveness.</v>

552
00:34:27.281 --> 00:34:28.114
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

553
00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:31.353
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

554
00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:32.733
<v Speaker 1>now if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're not very well organismic </v>

555
00:34:36.221 --> 00:34:39.640
<v Speaker 1>Lee adapted to the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a more love it.</v>

556
00:34:40.150 --> 00:34:43.270
<v Speaker 1>And because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you go somewhere familiar,</v>

557
00:34:43.390 --> 00:34:44.223
<v Speaker 1>people don't like you as much as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think they do and you're not nearly as </v>

558
00:34:47.651 --> 00:34:50.350
<v Speaker 1>much of a master of that situation as </v>
<v Speaker 1>you think you are.</v>

559
00:34:50.950 --> 00:34:51.783
<v Speaker 1>And what are the consequences of that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that would mean that your self </v>

560
00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:54.753
<v Speaker 1>representation is too rigid and </v>
<v Speaker 1>simplistic and full of defenses to </v>

561
00:34:59.050 --> 00:34:59.883
<v Speaker 1>notice the discrepancy between your </v>
<v Speaker 1>organism and the broader environment </v>

562
00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:06.430
<v Speaker 1>that's pathological.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the way that's going to be marked is</v>

563
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.670
<v Speaker 1>first by anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

564
00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:10.533
<v Speaker 1>maybe you tell a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some people sitting around you </v>

565
00:35:11.771 --> 00:35:13.660
<v Speaker 1>to tell the joke and you see people kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

566
00:35:14.090 --> 00:35:16.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making that face and maybe rolling their</v>

567
00:35:16.151 --> 00:35:16.871
<v Speaker 1>eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

568
00:35:16.871 --> 00:35:18.580
<v Speaker 1>well that's not exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think,</v>

569
00:35:18.581 --> 00:35:19.600
<v Speaker 1>well they're joking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

570
00:35:19.601 --> 00:35:21.010
<v Speaker 1>they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just teasing me.</v>

571
00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:22.143
<v Speaker 1>Well maybe they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they're damn sickie or stupid </v>

572
00:35:23.651 --> 00:35:26.260
<v Speaker 1>stories and you've told them 50 times </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're not very funny.</v>

573
00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:28.390
<v Speaker 1>And they'd rather you work in the bar at</v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

574
00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:31.630
<v Speaker 1>And it may be that you'll actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>notice that,</v>

575
00:35:32.290 --> 00:35:33.123
<v Speaker 1>but you don't necessarily notice it in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolically fully symbolically </v>

576
00:35:36.551 --> 00:35:37.384
<v Speaker 1>developed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what that would mean is maybe you </v>

577
00:35:39.991 --> 00:35:44.991
<v Speaker 1>start feeling anxiety and Roger's </v>
<v Speaker 1>identify as different levels of feeling.</v>

578
00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:51.510
<v Speaker 1>It might start with this subception and </v>
<v Speaker 1>to sub seed something,</v>

579
00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:54.900
<v Speaker 1>which is a word that I guess comes from </v>
<v Speaker 1>general semantics,</v>

580
00:35:55.530 --> 00:35:56.363
<v Speaker 1>is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have the event affect the way that </v>

581
00:36:02.851 --> 00:36:07.620
<v Speaker 1>you're interacting with the world in </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways that you don't necessarily notice.</v>

582
00:36:08.010 --> 00:36:08.843
<v Speaker 1>So it's sort of equivalent to the idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>of subliminal when you're talking about </v>

583
00:36:12.271 --> 00:36:13.104
<v Speaker 1>advertising,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a message is flashed out unit Stokley </v>

584
00:36:16.351 --> 00:36:18.450
<v Speaker 1>changes the way that you're interacting </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the world.</v>

585
00:36:18.451 --> 00:36:21.000
<v Speaker 1>But you don't notice that that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that happens to people all the time.</v>

586
00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:23.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's actually a part of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>normal cognitive structure.</v>

587
00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:24.383
<v Speaker 1>And when you walk into this room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the room tells you all sorts of things </v>

588
00:36:27.901 --> 00:36:28.734
<v Speaker 1>about how to behave and you don't notice</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the room is telling you those </v>

589
00:36:32.101 --> 00:36:32.934
<v Speaker 1>things because you know what it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>telling you so well that you just acted </v>

590
00:36:35.310 --> 00:36:36.143
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't need to go through all the </v>

591
00:36:37.381 --> 00:36:41.280
<v Speaker 1>complex processes of actually perceiving</v>
<v Speaker 1>and thinking about it.</v>

592
00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:42.533
<v Speaker 1>And so Roger's point is that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>detect things organismic Lee that will </v>

593
00:36:46.801 --> 00:36:47.634
<v Speaker 1>affect the nature of your experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>without necessarily either even </v>

594
00:36:51.271 --> 00:36:54.690
<v Speaker 1>perceiving that or definitely not </v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolically representing it.</v>

595
00:36:56.190 --> 00:37:01.190
<v Speaker 1>Now maybe the social discomfort that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>inherit in the situation rises up to the</v>

596
00:37:01.801 --> 00:37:04.680
<v Speaker 1>level of perception that's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolization yet.</v>

597
00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:05.853
<v Speaker 1>And then you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what does it feel like to be </v>

598
00:37:08.131 --> 00:37:08.964
<v Speaker 1>anxious?</v>

599
00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:12.150
<v Speaker 2>Well that,</v>

600
00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:15.870
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not asking what are the </v>
<v Speaker 1>objective markers of being anxious cause</v>

601
00:37:15.871 --> 00:37:19.860
<v Speaker 1>we actually don't know those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know we can kind of infer them.</v>

602
00:37:20.370 --> 00:37:21.203
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes people's heart rate goes up </v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes it decelerates and then </v>

603
00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:27.090
<v Speaker 1>there are facial expressions that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with anxiety.</v>

604
00:37:27.091 --> 00:37:30.240
<v Speaker 1>But you have to use those to infer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you get anxious,</v>

605
00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:33.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel your anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to infer it.</v>

606
00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:33.953
<v Speaker 1>But if you get anxious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel your anxiety and so then the </v>

607
00:37:36.271 --> 00:37:39.090
<v Speaker 1>question might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what does it mean to feel anxious?</v>

608
00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:40.723
<v Speaker 2>Well</v>

609
00:37:41.890 --> 00:37:42.723
<v Speaker 1>that's a hard question and the reason </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a hard question is because you </v>

610
00:37:44.981 --> 00:37:48.790
<v Speaker 1>never have to answer it because if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell someone I felt anxious,</v>

611
00:37:48.850 --> 00:37:49.683
<v Speaker 1>then they refer to their own feelings of</v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety and then they know what you </v>

612
00:37:52.211 --> 00:37:53.044
<v Speaker 1>mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you never have to come up with an </v>

613
00:37:54.251 --> 00:37:57.880
<v Speaker 1>explanation of what it feels like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The feeling this,</v>

614
00:37:58.030 --> 00:37:58.863
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that the feeling is an element </v>

615
00:38:00.491 --> 00:38:03.910
<v Speaker 1>of experience is something that we just </v>
<v Speaker 1>take for granted.</v>

616
00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:05.590
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got angry today.</v>

617
00:38:05.591 --> 00:38:07.540
<v Speaker 1>Everybody nods or maybe I tell a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

618
00:38:07.541 --> 00:38:08.051
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

619
00:38:08.051 --> 00:38:08.884
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go out on the bus and I was missing </v>

620
00:38:10.481 --> 00:38:11.314
<v Speaker 1>like 2 cents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I asked the bus driver if he would </v>

621
00:38:13.331 --> 00:38:16.420
<v Speaker 1>let me get on the bus and he didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And not really annoyed me because I take</v>

622
00:38:16.421 --> 00:38:20.810
<v Speaker 1>that bus every day and the driver knows </v>
<v Speaker 1>me and I got angry and everybody nod.</v>

623
00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:22.053
<v Speaker 1>And the reason they know od is what </v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because they can imagine that </v>

624
00:38:24.401 --> 00:38:26.410
<v Speaker 1>that's how they would have reacted in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that situation.</v>

625
00:38:26.411 --> 00:38:27.244
<v Speaker 1>But even more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they accept the reality of angry as a </v>

626
00:38:31.181 --> 00:38:33.310
<v Speaker 1>response and they know what it feels </v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

627
00:38:34.330 --> 00:38:36.670
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but explaining it,</v>

628
00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:38.943
<v Speaker 1>that's a much more difficult thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the point is is that you can have </v>

629
00:38:43.181 --> 00:38:46.090
<v Speaker 1>experiences that you know of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

630
00:38:46.091 --> 00:38:46.924
<v Speaker 1>you can have experiences that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know that would be the sub sieved </v>

631
00:38:49.031 --> 00:38:49.864
<v Speaker 1>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you can have experiences that you </v>

632
00:38:51.731 --> 00:38:52.564
<v Speaker 1>perceive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that you haven't symbolically </v>

633
00:38:54.371 --> 00:38:55.204
<v Speaker 1>represented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those might be emotional or </v>

634
00:38:56.171 --> 00:38:57.004
<v Speaker 1>motivational experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you can have experiences that </v>

635
00:38:59.741 --> 00:39:00.574
<v Speaker 1>you have symbolically represented in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>way that that captures their just </v>

636
00:39:03.641 --> 00:39:08.140
<v Speaker 1>accurately in a way that's reflective of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your adaptation or lack thereof.</v>

637
00:39:08.170 --> 00:39:09.003
<v Speaker 1>To the broader phenomenological world </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Rogers would say that ladder state </v>

638
00:39:13.331 --> 00:39:14.260
<v Speaker 1>is preferable.</v>

639
00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:17.343
<v Speaker 1>You know how to act or you know that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't act properly and you know how to </v>

640
00:39:22.271 --> 00:39:23.104
<v Speaker 1>fix it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is almost as good and you </v>

641
00:39:24.671 --> 00:39:25.504
<v Speaker 1>represent that accurately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you might imagine that you could </v>

642
00:39:29.861 --> 00:39:30.694
<v Speaker 1>concentrate on the mismatch between </v>
<v Speaker 1>organismic responses and the </v>

643
00:39:34.301 --> 00:39:35.134
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what behavior therapist really </v>

644
00:39:37.631 --> 00:39:38.980
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say,</v>

645
00:39:38.981 --> 00:39:39.814
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are you acting and what are the </v>

646
00:39:41.501 --> 00:39:42.334
<v Speaker 1>consequences?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that isn't really where Roger's </v>

647
00:39:44.381 --> 00:39:45.214
<v Speaker 1>goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rogers is more psychoanalytic then the </v>

648
00:39:49.271 --> 00:39:50.104
<v Speaker 1>behavior therapists and what he seems to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be primarily concerned of is about is </v>

649
00:39:53.411 --> 00:39:54.244
<v Speaker 1>whether or not your self representation </v>
<v Speaker 1>is an accurate representation of of how </v>

650
00:39:58.571 --> 00:40:02.080
<v Speaker 1>your organism is responding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In some sense for Rogers,</v>

651
00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:07.380
<v Speaker 1>the organism takes the place of God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more or less omniscient.</v>

652
00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:14.220
<v Speaker 1>So your organism is going to tell you </v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth in every situation and it's up</v>

653
00:40:14.471 --> 00:40:15.304
<v Speaker 1>to you whether or not you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pay attention to that and make sense of </v>

654
00:40:19.061 --> 00:40:19.894
<v Speaker 1>it or whether you're going to engage in </v>
<v Speaker 1>any of the different kinds of </v>

655
00:40:23.741 --> 00:40:24.574
<v Speaker 1>shenanigans that you might engage in to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stop yourself from going through the </v>

656
00:40:28.571 --> 00:40:30.700
<v Speaker 1>complex process of symbolization.</v>

657
00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:32.860
<v Speaker 1>Because you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

658
00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:35.440
<v Speaker 1>you're back in the bar and you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

659
00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:36.393
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you notice the anxiety and then you </v>

660
00:40:38.051 --> 00:40:40.540
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different ways of symbolizing it come to</v>

661
00:40:40.541 --> 00:40:43.960
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These people are all people are all just</v>

662
00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:47.560
<v Speaker 1>jerks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then another thing comes to mind is,</v>

663
00:40:47.561 --> 00:40:48.394
<v Speaker 1>well maybe nobody likes me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe another idea that's </v>

664
00:40:53.321 --> 00:40:55.330
<v Speaker 1>associated with symbolization comes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind,</v>

665
00:40:55.331 --> 00:40:56.590
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

666
00:40:56.591 --> 00:40:59.920
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's elements of my social </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior that I should adjust.</v>

667
00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:05.500
<v Speaker 1>And I presume that if Roger's was having</v>
<v Speaker 1>a conversation with one of his clients,</v>

668
00:41:05.501 --> 00:41:06.334
<v Speaker 1>he would assume that that was the most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the most fruitful potential </v>

669
00:41:10.301 --> 00:41:11.134
<v Speaker 1>step towards accurate symbolization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now Roger's felt that anxiety emerged </v>

670
00:41:16.841 --> 00:41:21.841
<v Speaker 1>when the south concept was not </v>
<v Speaker 1>accurately symbolically representing the</v>

671
00:41:23.141 --> 00:41:23.974
<v Speaker 1>organisms experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that would be in some sense if </v>

672
00:41:27.491 --> 00:41:28.324
<v Speaker 1>you're a house divided within yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then your pathological from a Rogerian </v>

673
00:41:34.131 --> 00:41:34.964
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can think about that in some </v>

674
00:41:37.071 --> 00:41:41.600
<v Speaker 1>sense as a move away from necessary </v>
<v Speaker 1>simplicity</v>

675
00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:43.153
<v Speaker 2>mean</v>

676
00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:45.533
<v Speaker 1>if your self concept is set up property,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't contain contradictory and </v>

677
00:41:50.221 --> 00:41:53.460
<v Speaker 1>misleading bits of information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything works seamlessly together.</v>

678
00:41:53.461 --> 00:41:56.970
<v Speaker 1>And so what that would mean is that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think about something,</v>

679
00:41:56.971 --> 00:41:57.804
<v Speaker 1>you act it out and it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that's an indication that the </v>

680
00:42:02.491 --> 00:42:07.050
<v Speaker 1>organization between say these different</v>
<v Speaker 1>three different levels of being is,</v>

681
00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:08.413
<v Speaker 1>while the right word is ice to morphine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each represents the other with </v>

682
00:42:11.401 --> 00:42:12.234
<v Speaker 1>sufficient accuracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that means that you're congruent </v>

683
00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:16.613
<v Speaker 1>and if you're congruent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the world is treating you not only </v>

684
00:42:22.141 --> 00:42:23.730
<v Speaker 1>in the manner that you want to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>treated,</v>

685
00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:27.090
<v Speaker 1>but also in the manner that's most </v>
<v Speaker 1>likely</v>

686
00:42:27.730 --> 00:42:28.563
<v Speaker 2>two</v>

687
00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:33.170
<v Speaker 1>further your actions in the world as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>organism.</v>

688
00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:34.813
<v Speaker 1>And so that's partly why Rogers believed</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the organism had wisdom because </v>

689
00:42:38.570 --> 00:42:39.403
<v Speaker 1>it's natural proclivity was to operate </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world effectively and to expand </v>

690
00:42:45.531 --> 00:42:47.090
<v Speaker 1>its competence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the same time</v>

691
00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:53.920
<v Speaker 1>I was self actualized person because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of Roger's phrases is someone</v>

692
00:42:54.141 --> 00:42:56.990
<v Speaker 1>who self concept accurately represents </v>
<v Speaker 1>their organismic</v>

693
00:42:57.290 --> 00:42:58.123
<v Speaker 2>Ba.</v>

694
00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:09.480
<v Speaker 1>Now Rogers was primarily a clinician as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well</v>

695
00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:14.350
<v Speaker 1>and his theories were derived from his </v>
<v Speaker 1>clinical experience</v>

696
00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:19.413
<v Speaker 1>and his theories informed his clinical </v>
<v Speaker 1>practice and Roger's invented or </v>

697
00:43:23.471 --> 00:43:24.304
<v Speaker 1>developed when he believed to be a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of therapy and he called that </v>

698
00:43:28.601 --> 00:43:29.434
<v Speaker 1>client centered therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you've probably heard about student </v>

699
00:43:32.051 --> 00:43:32.884
<v Speaker 1>centered education in Rogers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ideas have had a tremendous amount of </v>

700
00:43:36.641 --> 00:43:37.474
<v Speaker 1>influence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly not at least in educational </v>

701
00:43:38.831 --> 00:43:42.430
<v Speaker 1>psychology also in conflict reduction of</v>
<v Speaker 1>various sorts.</v>

702
00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:45.293
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

703
00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:47.600
<v Speaker 1>You start with Rogers initial </v>
<v Speaker 1>assumptions,</v>

704
00:43:47.601 --> 00:43:48.434
<v Speaker 1>which is first of all that you should </v>
<v Speaker 1>regard your experience as real second </v>

705
00:43:53.841 --> 00:43:54.674
<v Speaker 1>that your organism will give you </v>
<v Speaker 1>accurate information about the totality </v>

706
00:43:58.611 --> 00:44:02.210
<v Speaker 1>of experience</v>
<v Speaker 1>and third,</v>

707
00:44:02.211 --> 00:44:07.160
<v Speaker 1>that your self concept should accurately</v>
<v Speaker 1>encompass your actual experience.</v>

708
00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:09.980
<v Speaker 1>There are implications of that theory </v>
<v Speaker 1>for therapy.</v>

709
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:16.030
<v Speaker 1>And one of the implications is that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can figure out what you should do if you</v>

710
00:44:16.281 --> 00:44:17.114
<v Speaker 1>want to because your organism</v>
<v Speaker 1>will tell you or at least hint at you </v>

711
00:44:24.770 --> 00:44:28.160
<v Speaker 1>about which directions are correct and </v>
<v Speaker 1>which directions are.</v>

712
00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:33.330
<v Speaker 1>And if you follow those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to naturally gravitate</v>

713
00:44:33.331 --> 00:44:34.164
<v Speaker 1>towards a state of being where you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>more and more accurately represented by </v>

714
00:44:37.111 --> 00:44:38.550
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also that</v>

715
00:44:40.410 --> 00:44:44.130
<v Speaker 1>your representation and your organism </v>
<v Speaker 1>are going to act more effectively in the</v>

716
00:44:44.131 --> 00:44:44.964
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not bumping up against each </v>

717
00:44:45.871 --> 00:44:50.871
<v Speaker 1>other all the time and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there no one even conflict anymore.</v>

718
00:44:53.650 --> 00:44:57.660
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the goal of the self </v>
<v Speaker 1>actualized person if therapy</v>

719
00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:04.020
<v Speaker 1>in part is the art of furthering that </v>
<v Speaker 1>process of self actualization.</v>

720
00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:08.300
<v Speaker 1>Now Rogers,</v>

721
00:45:12.580 --> 00:45:13.413
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

722
00:45:14.130 --> 00:45:19.130
<v Speaker 1>Rogers was opposed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>diagnosis because he felt that it didn't</v>

723
00:45:23.431 --> 00:45:27.660
<v Speaker 1>sufficiently</v>
<v Speaker 1>represent the</v>

724
00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:34.220
<v Speaker 1>vital minutia of the client's individual</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

725
00:45:35.130 --> 00:45:35.963
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that his plane was extremely </v>

726
00:45:40.891 --> 00:45:42.630
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

727
00:45:42.650 --> 00:45:43.483
<v Speaker 1>because</v>
<v Speaker 1>medicine psychiatry tends to declassify </v>

728
00:45:49.891 --> 00:45:52.890
<v Speaker 1>everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you might say,</v>

729
00:45:52.891 --> 00:45:53.724
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are the psychiatric diagnostic </v>

730
00:45:54.631 --> 00:45:55.464
<v Speaker 1>classifications real?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then answer that is it depends on </v>

731
00:45:59.461 --> 00:46:02.490
<v Speaker 1>what you mean by real anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think,</v>

732
00:46:02.491 --> 00:46:05.280
<v Speaker 1>well that's an annoying answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is.</v>

733
00:46:05.370 --> 00:46:06.203
<v Speaker 1>It is still the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I could say if I was being </v>

734
00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:10.793
<v Speaker 1>cynical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I don't really think it's a </v>

735
00:46:12.541 --> 00:46:15.570
<v Speaker 1>cynical response,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I was willing to sound cynical,</v>

736
00:46:16.380 --> 00:46:17.213
<v Speaker 1>that the only reason that psychiatrists </v>
<v Speaker 1>diagnose their clients is so that </v>

737
00:46:20.551 --> 00:46:21.384
<v Speaker 1>insurance companies can pay the bills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I actually believe that that's more </v>

738
00:46:24.991 --> 00:46:25.824
<v Speaker 1>true than the claim that the psychiatric</v>
<v Speaker 1>diagnostic categories accurately </v>

739
00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:33.150
<v Speaker 1>actually capture the essence of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>person's problems.</v>

740
00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:38.430
<v Speaker 1>In my clinical experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>classification</v>

741
00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:40.793
<v Speaker 1>has had almost a zero utility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is because it's </v>

742
00:46:43.741 --> 00:46:44.574
<v Speaker 1>too low resolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't capture the individual </v>

743
00:46:46.741 --> 00:46:47.574
<v Speaker 1>property.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the thing about a client </v>

744
00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:54.840
<v Speaker 1>clinical client is that it's precisely </v>
<v Speaker 1>their individuality.</v>

745
00:46:54.841 --> 00:46:55.674
<v Speaker 1>That's the fundamental issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like they have to make their way </v>

746
00:46:58.801 --> 00:46:59.634
<v Speaker 1>through the world in their body and </v>
<v Speaker 1>their in their time and their position </v>

747
00:47:04.921 --> 00:47:08.100
<v Speaker 1>in culture with their advantages and </v>
<v Speaker 1>disadvantages.</v>

748
00:47:08.370 --> 00:47:13.140
<v Speaker 1>And that requires</v>
<v Speaker 1>our unique,</v>

749
00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:17.070
<v Speaker 1>a solution that's unique in many ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one that's also personal.</v>

750
00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:26.180
<v Speaker 1>And Rogers also wasn't a particularly</v>
<v Speaker 1>great fan of the psychoanalysts tendency</v>

751
00:47:29.651 --> 00:47:34.651
<v Speaker 1>to look for the causes of present </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior in past events.</v>

752
00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:37.473
<v Speaker 1>So he didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't regard fishing in the past as </v>

753
00:47:41.681 --> 00:47:42.514
<v Speaker 1>a useful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily useful expedition or as a </v>

754
00:47:46.471 --> 00:47:47.304
<v Speaker 1>necessary expedition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although if issues of the past came up </v>

755
00:47:50.501 --> 00:47:52.870
<v Speaker 1>in therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was perfectly willing to,</v>

756
00:47:54.910 --> 00:47:56.200
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to deal with them.</v>

757
00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:57.713
<v Speaker 1>He didn't accept except the Freudian in </v>
<v Speaker 1>theory that the fundamental cause of </v>

758
00:48:01.451 --> 00:48:06.451
<v Speaker 1>psychopathology was saying traumatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>past experience.</v>

759
00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:12.230
<v Speaker 2>Right</v>

760
00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:16.370
<v Speaker 1>now this gives Rogerian therapy a </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular flavor.</v>

761
00:48:18.050 --> 00:48:20.300
<v Speaker 1>You could also call it non directive </v>
<v Speaker 1>therapy.</v>

762
00:48:21.590 --> 00:48:24.110
<v Speaker 1>Now if you're a behavior therapist,</v>

763
00:48:28.070 --> 00:48:33.070
<v Speaker 1>you might actively strategize with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>client about what they're going to do in</v>

764
00:48:33.561 --> 00:48:37.010
<v Speaker 1>the next week and then once they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>established their goals,</v>

765
00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:38.503
<v Speaker 1>you might offer some hints about what </v>
<v Speaker 1>strategies they could use to monitor </v>

766
00:48:41.991 --> 00:48:42.824
<v Speaker 1>themselves and to attain those goals and</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you'll even have them keep track </v>

767
00:48:46.911 --> 00:48:50.000
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roger's generally speaking,</v>

768
00:48:50.001 --> 00:48:50.834
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't do something that directed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact he strove not to unduly </v>

769
00:48:56.001 --> 00:48:59.650
<v Speaker 1>influence the client's decisions about </v>
<v Speaker 1>important future of.</v>

770
00:48:59.750 --> 00:49:04.750
<v Speaker 1>And in that way he was quite similar to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud because Freud would sit behind,</v>

771
00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:08.540
<v Speaker 1>would sit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the client would be laying on a couch</v>

772
00:49:08.541 --> 00:49:13.400
<v Speaker 1>and Freud would set so that the client </v>
<v Speaker 1>is patient actually couldn't see him and</v>

773
00:49:13.401 --> 00:49:16.280
<v Speaker 1>then he would listen to the person free </v>
<v Speaker 1>associate,</v>

774
00:49:16.281 --> 00:49:18.800
<v Speaker 1>which in some sense means that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>would ramble on.</v>

775
00:49:19.350 --> 00:49:20.183
<v Speaker 1>And he was attempting by doing that to </v>
<v Speaker 1>facilitate the self realization of </v>

776
00:49:27.861 --> 00:49:29.840
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of their own memories.</v>

777
00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:34.070
<v Speaker 1>If things happen to you in your past and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they still cars you emotion,</v>

778
00:49:34.130 --> 00:49:36.800
<v Speaker 1>let's say they're more than 18 months </v>
<v Speaker 1>old for the sake of argument,</v>

779
00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:38.653
<v Speaker 1>Freud would assume that if you kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>wandered around that memory somewhat </v>

780
00:49:41.571 --> 00:49:42.404
<v Speaker 1>haphazardly and in an in an association </v>
<v Speaker 1>will weigh the way conversations </v>

781
00:49:46.191 --> 00:49:50.420
<v Speaker 1>naturally unfold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you would bring things to light and</v>

782
00:49:50.421 --> 00:49:52.850
<v Speaker 1>that would allow certain kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional expression and that,</v>

783
00:49:52.851 --> 00:49:56.360
<v Speaker 1>and in fact in itself would be curative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for,</v>

784
00:49:56.361 --> 00:49:57.194
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to with your fear with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that process or guide it to any great </v>

785
00:49:59.031 --> 00:50:00.740
<v Speaker 1>degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so rogers was like that.</v>

786
00:50:00.741 --> 00:50:01.574
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wanted you to make your own </v>

787
00:50:02.331 --> 00:50:03.164
<v Speaker 1>decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he believed that the therapeutic </v>

788
00:50:06.021 --> 00:50:11.021
<v Speaker 1>endeavor required</v>
<v Speaker 1>could not,</v>

789
00:50:12.550 --> 00:50:15.730
<v Speaker 1>could not occur unless certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions were met</v>

790
00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:18.510
<v Speaker 1>and the conditions were</v>

791
00:50:21.220 --> 00:50:25.120
<v Speaker 1>willingness to tell the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

792
00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:29.090
<v Speaker 1>when we're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when a client comes to see me,</v>

793
00:50:29.970 --> 00:50:34.610
<v Speaker 1>one of the first things I tell them is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can tell me anything you want.</v>

794
00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:40.070
<v Speaker 1>Although you're perfectly within your </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights to maintain your privacy.</v>

795
00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:44.570
<v Speaker 1>You can tell me anything that you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but tell me the truth as much as clearly</v>

796
00:50:44.571 --> 00:50:45.830
<v Speaker 1>as you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you don't,</v>

797
00:50:45.831 --> 00:50:48.080
<v Speaker 1>there isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what's going on with you.</v>

798
00:50:48.081 --> 00:50:51.770
<v Speaker 1>And there's not a possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not any possibility at all that I can,</v>

799
00:50:52.370 --> 00:50:53.203
<v Speaker 1>that this process will be useful if </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about things that don't </v>

800
00:50:57.021 --> 00:50:57.854
<v Speaker 1>exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one precondition is the person is </v>

801
00:51:00.081 --> 00:51:03.650
<v Speaker 1>willing to come and see you because that</v>
<v Speaker 1>means they want to transform.</v>

802
00:51:04.580 --> 00:51:07.610
<v Speaker 1>The second precondition is that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to communicate with you.</v>

803
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:11.690
<v Speaker 1>And communication means they're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do their best to tell the truth.</v>

804
00:51:11.691 --> 00:51:13.310
<v Speaker 1>But the therapist takes the same</v>

805
00:51:15.490 --> 00:51:16.323
<v Speaker 1>vow in a sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that I tell my </v>

806
00:51:18.431 --> 00:51:23.431
<v Speaker 1>clients is that I will never let them do</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that makes me resent them.</v>

807
00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:25.533
<v Speaker 1>So if I'm asked to step out of my way </v>
<v Speaker 1>for some reason to take an additional </v>

808
00:51:29.081 --> 00:51:32.200
<v Speaker 1>session or maybe to meet them somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I do it,</v>

809
00:51:32.620 --> 00:51:37.620
<v Speaker 1>they can be assured that there won't be </v>
<v Speaker 1>a price that will be extracted from them</v>

810
00:51:38.861 --> 00:51:43.750
<v Speaker 1>later for interfering with the smooth </v>
<v Speaker 1>flow of my day.</v>

811
00:51:45.130 --> 00:51:48.760
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the other thing that I do,</v>

812
00:51:48.761 --> 00:51:52.120
<v Speaker 1>and I've learned this from Rogers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the other people I've read,</v>

813
00:51:52.121 --> 00:51:57.121
<v Speaker 1>is that I listen to people talk and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes something will occur to me and</v>

814
00:51:59.470 --> 00:52:00.303
<v Speaker 1>I don't think about it as I thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>something because I'm actually somewhat </v>

815
00:52:05.051 --> 00:52:09.700
<v Speaker 1>a follower of Nick Nietzsche's dictum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that the fact that you think is</v>

816
00:52:09.701 --> 00:52:10.534
<v Speaker 1>no proof that the fact that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced thoughts is no proof that </v>

817
00:52:14.861 --> 00:52:18.040
<v Speaker 1>you thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just appear.</v>

818
00:52:19.060 --> 00:52:19.893
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't think that you think up your </v>

819
00:52:20.621 --> 00:52:21.910
<v Speaker 1>dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

820
00:52:21.940 --> 00:52:24.730
<v Speaker 1>You have your dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There you are in band.</v>

821
00:52:25.270 --> 00:52:27.430
<v Speaker 1>They're the dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you having them?</v>

822
00:52:27.700 --> 00:52:30.010
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't seem like it.</v>

823
00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:30.873
<v Speaker 1>It seems like you're experiencing this </v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense the same way experienced </v>

824
00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:36.580
<v Speaker 1>the external world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what voluntary creating them.</v>

825
00:52:37.060 --> 00:52:40.600
<v Speaker 1>Well why do you think anything different</v>
<v Speaker 1>about your thoughts?</v>

826
00:52:43.310 --> 00:52:45.440
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very useful thing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>realize by the way.</v>

827
00:52:45.441 --> 00:52:46.274
<v Speaker 1>Because otherwise you think your your </v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts and then if you have negative </v>

828
00:52:48.231 --> 00:52:49.064
<v Speaker 1>thoughts while then you assume that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're true and they're not true just </v>

829
00:52:53.031 --> 00:52:53.864
<v Speaker 1>because you think them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just thoughts and maybe they're </v>

830
00:52:55.371 --> 00:52:57.410
<v Speaker 1>true and maybe they're useful and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not.</v>

831
00:52:57.680 --> 00:53:01.280
<v Speaker 1>So stepping back from them a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>is incredibly,</v>

832
00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:03.320
<v Speaker 1>it's like Buddhist detachment in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

833
00:53:03.321 --> 00:53:04.154
<v Speaker 1>It's an incredibly useful thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's another thing that's </v>

834
00:53:06.651 --> 00:53:09.980
<v Speaker 1>really characteristic of modern people </v>
<v Speaker 1>because especially if they're smart,</v>

835
00:53:10.580 --> 00:53:12.740
<v Speaker 1>they think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think first of all,</v>

836
00:53:13.010 --> 00:53:18.010
<v Speaker 1>and second they think that the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>they think are true and neither of those</v>

837
00:53:18.081 --> 00:53:18.914
<v Speaker 1>things are necessarily true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And abandoning your belief in the makes </v>

838
00:53:21.891 --> 00:53:22.724
<v Speaker 1>you</v>
<v Speaker 1>much less rigid and much more able to </v>

839
00:53:31.410 --> 00:53:32.243
<v Speaker 1>expand your preconceptions or even </v>
<v Speaker 1>radically change them when the </v>

840
00:53:34.921 --> 00:53:38.250
<v Speaker 1>circumstances demand them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

841
00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:41.813
<v Speaker 1>the person has to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanting to change in principal in a </v>

842
00:53:45.991 --> 00:53:46.824
<v Speaker 1>positive direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to be willing to tell the </v>

843
00:53:48.811 --> 00:53:49.644
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the next element of Rogerian </v>

844
00:53:51.780 --> 00:53:53.490
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapy is something that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>called</v>

845
00:53:55.410 --> 00:54:00.410
<v Speaker 1>unconditional positive regard</v>
<v Speaker 1>and unconditional positive regard.</v>

846
00:54:02.991 --> 00:54:07.940
<v Speaker 1>And the Rogerian tradition is something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like radical acceptance.</v>

847
00:54:09.890 --> 00:54:13.490
<v Speaker 1>It's actually a hallmark of modern child</v>
<v Speaker 1>rearing techniques.</v>

848
00:54:14.570 --> 00:54:19.570
<v Speaker 1>You should wholeheartedly accept all </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspects of the person's being.</v>

849
00:54:21.620 --> 00:54:26.620
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rogers believed that are positive,</v>

850
00:54:28.071 --> 00:54:32.000
<v Speaker 1>that partly because he also believed in,</v>

851
00:54:34.940 --> 00:54:35.910
<v Speaker 2>what was it called,</v>

852
00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:38.640
<v Speaker 1>conditions of worth.</v>

853
00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:47.690
<v Speaker 1>Here's a condition of worth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like you when you act like that.</v>

854
00:54:49.370 --> 00:54:51.050
<v Speaker 1>So you imagine you might tell a child </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

855
00:54:51.980 --> 00:54:52.813
<v Speaker 1>I don't like you when you act like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe you tell them that about a </v>

856
00:54:56.571 --> 00:54:57.404
<v Speaker 1>bunch of things that they do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe those are integral parts of </v>

857
00:55:00.981 --> 00:55:05.981
<v Speaker 1>the child's Ba and by making your lack </v>
<v Speaker 1>of acceptance,</v>

858
00:55:09.710 --> 00:55:10.543
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make it impossible for the child to </v>

859
00:55:14.271 --> 00:55:15.104
<v Speaker 1>incorporate those aspects of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>organism organismal experience into his </v>

860
00:55:18.840 --> 00:55:19.673
<v Speaker 1>self concept.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see echoes of the Super Ego </v>

861
00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:27.500
<v Speaker 1>Eagle idea there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so rogers would say,</v>

862
00:55:27.501 --> 00:55:28.334
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone comes into psychotherapy and </v>

863
00:55:30.561 --> 00:55:32.900
<v Speaker 1>experiences unconditional positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>regard,</v>

864
00:55:33.470 --> 00:55:37.340
<v Speaker 1>that means that they'll be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>reveal those elements up there.</v>

865
00:55:37.370 --> 00:55:42.370
<v Speaker 1>Organismic experienced that have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>rejected and say by the social world and</v>

866
00:55:42.561 --> 00:55:43.394
<v Speaker 1>themselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced them and then potentially </v>

867
00:55:47.481 --> 00:55:51.290
<v Speaker 1>incorporate them within the self concept</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that that's going to be a good thing</v>

868
00:55:51.710 --> 00:55:52.543
<v Speaker 1>because rogers is a great believer in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the natural inevitability of positive </v>

869
00:55:56.750 --> 00:56:01.750
<v Speaker 1>transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If if you set that up as your goal,</v>

870
00:56:02.870 --> 00:56:03.703
<v Speaker 1>he also believes that that should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>your goal and that it's actually your </v>

871
00:56:06.711 --> 00:56:10.490
<v Speaker 1>natural goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If for example,</v>

872
00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:15.020
<v Speaker 1>you haven't been subjected to arbitrary </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions of worth.</v>

873
00:56:17.950 --> 00:56:18.783
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

874
00:56:19.310 --> 00:56:21.410
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm going to read you something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rodger's road,</v>

875
00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:27.160
<v Speaker 1>which is quite interesting and I think I</v>
<v Speaker 1>found it extremely effective.</v>

876
00:56:40.290 --> 00:56:42.210
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another thing I should mention.</v>

877
00:56:43.020 --> 00:56:48.020
<v Speaker 1>There is one other important assumption </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the idea of self actualization.</v>

878
00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:56.753
<v Speaker 1>The other thing that Roger's tried to </v>
<v Speaker 1>ensure that his clients develop was </v>

879
00:57:00.210 --> 00:57:04.530
<v Speaker 1>autonomy and independence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now for Rogers,</v>

880
00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:11.360
<v Speaker 1>there was very little difference between</v>
<v Speaker 1>the move towards autonomy and in any and</v>

881
00:57:11.731 --> 00:57:15.840
<v Speaker 1>personal independence and the process of</v>
<v Speaker 1>self actualization.</v>

882
00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:20.753
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

883
00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:27.860
<v Speaker 1>given that we're looking back at Roger's</v>
<v Speaker 1>work 50 years later,</v>

884
00:57:29.900 --> 00:57:34.900
<v Speaker 1>you might ask yourself is if</v>
<v Speaker 1>autonomy and independence is a necessary</v>

885
00:57:37.340 --> 00:57:42.340
<v Speaker 1>precondition for psychological health</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you could make the case that</v>

886
00:57:44.420 --> 00:57:49.420
<v Speaker 1>productive interdependence</v>
<v Speaker 1>and more communal orientation is equally</v>

887
00:57:50.301 --> 00:57:51.134
<v Speaker 1>healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not a Rogerian </v>

888
00:57:55.400 --> 00:57:56.233
<v Speaker 1>presupposition.</v>

889
00:57:57.380 --> 00:57:58.213
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

890
00:57:58.850 --> 00:58:02.180
<v Speaker 1>his ideal is the fully functioning </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>

891
00:58:10.610 --> 00:58:15.500
<v Speaker 1>So here's his hypothesis with regards to</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapy,</v>

892
00:58:17.750 --> 00:58:18.583
<v Speaker 1>assuming a minimal mutual willingness to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be in contact and to receive </v>

893
00:58:22.341 --> 00:58:23.174
<v Speaker 1>communications,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we may say that the greater the </v>

894
00:58:26.151 --> 00:58:26.984
<v Speaker 1>communicated congruence of experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>awareness and behavior on the part of </v>

895
00:58:29.991 --> 00:58:30.824
<v Speaker 1>one individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more the ensuing relationship will </v>

896
00:58:33.051 --> 00:58:37.040
<v Speaker 1>involve a tendency towards reciprocal </v>
<v Speaker 1>communication with the same qualities,</v>

897
00:58:38.330 --> 00:58:39.163
<v Speaker 1>mutually accurate understanding of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>communication's improved psychological </v>

898
00:58:42.681 --> 00:58:43.514
<v Speaker 1>adjustment and functioning in both </v>
<v Speaker 1>parties and mutual satisfaction in the </v>

899
00:58:46.131 --> 00:58:48.140
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

900
00:58:48.141 --> 00:58:52.850
<v Speaker 1>so let's unpack that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Assuming a minimal mutual willingness to</v>

901
00:58:52.851 --> 00:58:55.190
<v Speaker 1>be in contact and to receive </v>
<v Speaker 1>communication.</v>

902
00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:56.113
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing you might say is that </v>

903
00:58:56.671 --> 00:58:59.060
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty much though the hallmark of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a relationship,</v>

904
00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:02.330
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're not in contact,</v>

905
00:59:02.331 --> 00:59:04.100
<v Speaker 1>while clearly you don't have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>

906
00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:07.050
<v Speaker 1>and if you are in contact but you're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>communicating,</v>

907
00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:08.900
<v Speaker 1>you probably don't have a relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

908
00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:10.740
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

909
00:59:12.930 --> 00:59:13.763
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that also begs the question of exactly </v>

910
00:59:15.031 --> 00:59:15.864
<v Speaker 1>what a relationship is for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's something that's very much </v>

911
00:59:18.601 --> 00:59:19.434
<v Speaker 1>worth considering because people don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>really usually know what a relationship </v>

912
00:59:22.431 --> 00:59:23.264
<v Speaker 1>is for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They certainly know that as a general </v>

913
00:59:25.161 --> 00:59:26.810
<v Speaker 1>rule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to pursue them,</v>

914
00:59:27.140 --> 00:59:29.600
<v Speaker 1>but they don't really have any idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense,</v>

915
00:59:29.601 --> 00:59:34.190
<v Speaker 1>what the optimal state is or what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>desired finance state should be.</v>

916
00:59:34.350 --> 00:59:35.183
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course the desired final state 50 </v>

917
00:59:37.371 --> 00:59:38.750
<v Speaker 1>years ago was marriage,</v>

918
00:59:39.180 --> 00:59:42.300
<v Speaker 2>but</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

919
00:59:43.120 --> 00:59:46.600
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly the case now that most </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are couples aren't married.</v>

920
00:59:47.770 --> 00:59:48.940
<v Speaker 1>Now you might ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

921
00:59:48.941 --> 00:59:49.774
<v Speaker 1>what's the utility of a relationship and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the utility of a longterm </v>

922
00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:54.873
<v Speaker 1>relationship?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While the Rogerian answer to that would </v>

923
00:59:58.121 --> 01:00:03.121
<v Speaker 1>be</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more based on trust,</v>

924
01:00:07.470 --> 01:00:08.303
<v Speaker 1>the relationship is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more likely that you're going to be </v>

925
01:00:12.551 --> 01:00:14.890
<v Speaker 1>in contact and to receive </v>
<v Speaker 1>communications.</v>

926
01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:20.810
<v Speaker 1>And then as a consequence of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to</v>

927
01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:25.473
<v Speaker 1>become better and better at representing</v>
<v Speaker 1>your organismal experience within your </v>

928
01:00:31.221 --> 01:00:32.054
<v Speaker 1>self concept.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's going to facilitate your </v>

929
01:00:34.631 --> 01:00:37.750
<v Speaker 1>movement towards self awareness and self</v>
<v Speaker 1>actualization.</v>

930
01:00:39.850 --> 01:00:41.980
<v Speaker 1>It's a two brains are better than one </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>

931
01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:44.111
<v Speaker 1>So we say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

932
01:00:44.111 --> 01:00:46.270
<v Speaker 1>we established a relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

933
01:00:46.271 --> 01:00:49.180
<v Speaker 1>And the goal of our relationship is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make things better.</v>

934
01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:51.213
<v Speaker 1>And we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we make a presupposition that the way </v>

935
01:00:52.721 --> 01:00:57.340
<v Speaker 1>you make things better is by telling the</v>
<v Speaker 1>truth as you see it.</v>

936
01:00:57.670 --> 01:01:00.730
<v Speaker 1>So remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a phenomenological theory.</v>

937
01:01:00.731 --> 01:01:05.110
<v Speaker 1>And so the truth that Rogers is talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about isn't objective truth.</v>

938
01:01:05.111 --> 01:01:08.890
<v Speaker 1>And I suspect that that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in part because establishing an</v>

939
01:01:08.891 --> 01:01:13.060
<v Speaker 1>objective truth within the confines of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship is I think it's technically</v>

940
01:01:13.061 --> 01:01:13.894
<v Speaker 1>impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we talked about that before because </v>

941
01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:17.193
<v Speaker 1>each interaction between the members of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple or people in any relationship </v>

942
01:01:21.610 --> 01:01:26.350
<v Speaker 1>is contaminated in a sense by all of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other interactions they've ever had.</v>

943
01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:29.260
<v Speaker 1>Plus everything they bring to bear on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the situation.</v>

944
01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:31.610
<v Speaker 1>And there's just no untangling that </v>
<v Speaker 1>objective.</v>

945
01:01:32.310 --> 01:01:34.260
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did you mean when you said that?</v>

946
01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:35.190
<v Speaker 2>That.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

947
01:01:35.430 --> 01:01:36.270
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

948
01:01:37.620 --> 01:01:40.200
<v Speaker 2>you can argue about that for,</v>

949
01:01:41.070 --> 01:01:43.620
<v Speaker 1>to the point of divorce and for 10 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>afterwards,</v>

950
01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:44.773
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without ever coming to a satisfactory </v>

951
01:01:45.931 --> 01:01:47.820
<v Speaker 1>conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>

952
01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:49.013
<v Speaker 1>The grade greater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the communicated congruence of </v>

953
01:01:50.641 --> 01:01:51.474
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>awareness and behavior on the part of </v>

954
01:01:52.711 --> 01:01:53.544
<v Speaker 1>one individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more the ensuing relationship will </v>

955
01:01:55.591 --> 01:01:59.040
<v Speaker 1>involve a tendency towards reciprocal </v>
<v Speaker 1>communication with the same quality.</v>

956
01:01:59.130 --> 01:02:00.420
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's the idea.</v>

957
01:02:00.870 --> 01:02:03.380
<v Speaker 1>You go see a psychotherapist or a jury </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapist,</v>

958
01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:04.253
<v Speaker 1>and at least in principle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is someone who's mastered or is it </v>

959
01:02:07.831 --> 01:02:12.150
<v Speaker 1>tempting to master these basic modes of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being?</v>

960
01:02:12.390 --> 01:02:14.340
<v Speaker 1>So what they're going to do is they'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you,</v>

961
01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:17.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tell you the truth as I see</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

962
01:02:17.970 --> 01:02:22.890
<v Speaker 1>And so the way I see that happening in </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapy is that when someone comes</v>

963
01:02:22.891 --> 01:02:24.960
<v Speaker 1>to see me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I listened to them.</v>

964
01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:29.310
<v Speaker 1>And that means that I'm not distracted </v>
<v Speaker 1>by anything else.</v>

965
01:02:29.311 --> 01:02:32.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm not thinking about anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not thinking about what I'm going to</v>

966
01:02:32.941 --> 01:02:33.774
<v Speaker 1>say next.</v>

967
01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:36.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm not thinking about the things I have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do today.</v>

968
01:02:37.110 --> 01:02:40.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm not thinking about the last time I </v>
<v Speaker 1>saw this person.</v>

969
01:02:40.831 --> 01:02:41.664
<v Speaker 1>I'm not allowing my attention to wander </v>
<v Speaker 1>away from the person and then I'm </v>

970
01:02:46.441 --> 01:02:47.274
<v Speaker 1>watching them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and listening to them at the same time </v>

971
01:02:50.641 --> 01:02:52.920
<v Speaker 1>and those are the same things because to</v>
<v Speaker 1>really listen to someone,</v>

972
01:02:52.921 --> 01:02:53.754
<v Speaker 1>you also have to watch them because then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you sub c perhaps or perceive all the </v>

973
01:02:57.811 --> 01:03:00.690
<v Speaker 1>nonverbal elements of communication that</v>
<v Speaker 1>go along well,</v>

974
01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:01.553
<v Speaker 1>partly with voice tone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a with I direction and partly with </v>

975
01:03:04.171 --> 01:03:06.880
<v Speaker 1>very subtle transformations of facial </v>
<v Speaker 1>gesture.</v>

976
01:03:06.881 --> 01:03:08.160
<v Speaker 1>So sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

977
01:03:08.370 --> 01:03:11.640
<v Speaker 1>I see on my clients that they'll all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a sudden turn into a child.</v>

978
01:03:11.670 --> 01:03:12.503
<v Speaker 1>It's very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like there'll be recounting some </v>

979
01:03:14.161 --> 01:03:14.994
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like fixation from a Freudian </v>

980
01:03:16.531 --> 01:03:17.690
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There'll be,</v>

981
01:03:18.110 --> 01:03:20.100
<v Speaker 1>there'll be describing some experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the,</v>

982
01:03:20.250 --> 01:03:21.083
<v Speaker 1>from the distant past and for a second </v>
<v Speaker 1>there expression will approximate who </v>

983
01:03:24.661 --> 01:03:27.060
<v Speaker 1>they were when they were six years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>

984
01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:27.953
<v Speaker 1>it's really something remarkable to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can see these things if you </v>

985
01:03:30.691 --> 01:03:34.470
<v Speaker 1>really pay attention and then as they </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk,</v>

986
01:03:38.310 --> 01:03:39.143
<v Speaker 1>I'm watching what's happening inside me </v>
<v Speaker 1>as I listened to their words and all </v>

987
01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:47.370
<v Speaker 1>sorts of things will happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I'll get an image or sometimes</v>

988
01:03:47.371 --> 01:03:48.204
<v Speaker 1>I'll get a memory of something we talked</v>
<v Speaker 1>about before or sometimes I'll notice </v>

989
01:03:51.901 --> 01:03:52.734
<v Speaker 1>that what they're saying right now is </v>
<v Speaker 1>different than something they said five </v>

990
01:03:55.171 --> 01:03:56.400
<v Speaker 1>minutes ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then I'll say,</v>

991
01:03:56.401 --> 01:03:57.780
<v Speaker 1>wait a sec.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

992
01:03:58.020 --> 01:03:58.853
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to understand what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>telling me and I noticed that you just </v>

993
01:04:01.831 --> 01:04:02.664
<v Speaker 1>said this and it seems to imply this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you know a couple of minutes </v>

994
01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:07.343
<v Speaker 1>ago when we were talking about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you said this and I don't see how </v>

995
01:04:09.541 --> 01:04:10.374
<v Speaker 1>those two things are the same and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>not doing that because I want them to </v>

996
01:04:15.630 --> 01:04:16.463
<v Speaker 1>rectify the paradox.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing that because I want to </v>

997
01:04:19.801 --> 01:04:20.634
<v Speaker 1>understand what they are saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if someone says 80 u and then they </v>

998
01:04:23.431 --> 01:04:25.350
<v Speaker 1>say be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what they're saying.</v>

999
01:04:25.770 --> 01:04:28.770
<v Speaker 1>And so the question is for </v>
<v Speaker 1>clarification,</v>

1000
01:04:28.860 --> 01:04:32.220
<v Speaker 1>there's no other direction than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe,</v>

1001
01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:34.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll have little image,</v>

1002
01:04:34.141 --> 01:04:36.180
<v Speaker 1>like the sort of a fragment of a dream </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll say,</v>

1003
01:04:36.181 --> 01:04:39.690
<v Speaker 1>wait a second with what you just said </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you said what you just said,</v>

1004
01:04:39.691 --> 01:04:40.524
<v Speaker 1>this is what I experienced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe we'll talk for awhile </v>

1005
01:04:42.990 --> 01:04:45.230
<v Speaker 1>about what that might mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1006
01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:48.350
<v Speaker 1>and I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can say to them what,</v>

1007
01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:50.610
<v Speaker 1>so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes,</v>

1008
01:04:50.730 --> 01:04:53.820
<v Speaker 1>sometimes people will come to my office </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they do all sorts of strange things.</v>

1009
01:04:53.821 --> 01:04:54.654
<v Speaker 1>Like I had one client who had</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychosomatic epilepsy and one of the </v>

1010
01:05:01.691 --> 01:05:04.720
<v Speaker 1>first times I saw her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she had a seizure in my office.</v>

1011
01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:06.273
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1012
01:05:06.670 --> 01:05:07.503
<v Speaker 1>I was watching her and it didn't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter to me that she was having a </v>

1013
01:05:10.961 --> 01:05:11.794
<v Speaker 1>seizure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought that's pretty weird </v>

1014
01:05:13.541 --> 01:05:15.610
<v Speaker 1>because normally when someone's having a</v>
<v Speaker 1>seizure,</v>

1015
01:05:15.611 --> 01:05:18.180
<v Speaker 1>it's like you get affected</v>

1016
01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:18.810
<v Speaker 1>by it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1017
01:05:18.810 --> 01:05:19.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1018
01:05:19.860 --> 01:05:20.693
<v Speaker 1>there's sensations that emerge in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>mid section and there's thoughts of </v>

1019
01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:26.820
<v Speaker 1>emergency and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1020
01:05:26.821 --> 01:05:29.520
<v Speaker 1>cause your body in some sense is </v>
<v Speaker 1>mimicking their body,</v>

1021
01:05:29.521 --> 01:05:32.130
<v Speaker 1>which is what your body does all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time when you're talking to people.</v>

1022
01:05:32.340 --> 01:05:33.173
<v Speaker 1>And that produces a sense of urgency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I just sort of watched her have the </v>

1023
01:05:36.241 --> 01:05:37.230
<v Speaker 1>seizure and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1024
01:05:37.231 --> 01:05:40.650
<v Speaker 1>it's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not real seizures.</v>

1025
01:05:40.780 --> 01:05:42.810
<v Speaker 1>But she was very good at it and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1026
01:05:42.811 --> 01:05:43.644
<v Speaker 1>as far as she was concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she couldn't tell if the seizures were </v>

1027
01:05:45.211 --> 01:05:46.044
<v Speaker 1>real or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes if you have cycle genic </v>

1028
01:05:48.511 --> 01:05:49.344
<v Speaker 1>epilepsy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've had an epileptic seizure at one </v>

1029
01:05:51.211 --> 01:05:55.290
<v Speaker 1>point that was genuine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's very exceptionally complicated</v>

1030
01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:57.750
<v Speaker 1>and it's not easy to develop psychogenic</v>
<v Speaker 1>epilepsy,</v>

1031
01:05:58.080 --> 01:05:58.913
<v Speaker 1>but</v>
<v Speaker 1>she had developed it and part of the </v>

1032
01:06:02.391 --> 01:06:03.260
<v Speaker 1>reason was</v>

1033
01:06:05.590 --> 01:06:06.423
<v Speaker 1>that she thought that she was toying </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the idea at that existence as a </v>

1034
01:06:10.121 --> 01:06:15.121
<v Speaker 1>psychiatric patient would require less </v>
<v Speaker 1>effort and responsibility and so she got</v>

1035
01:06:15.431 --> 01:06:16.264
<v Speaker 1>tangled up at one point with one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mental hospitals and they diagnosed her </v>

1036
01:06:19.601 --> 01:06:22.630
<v Speaker 1>with paranoid schizophrenia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not something I would recommend</v>

1037
01:06:22.631 --> 01:06:24.610
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you don't actually have it</v>

1038
01:06:25.030 --> 01:06:25.863
<v Speaker 1>because once you've got the diagnosis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well are you really going to know that </v>

1039
01:06:30.071 --> 01:06:31.830
<v Speaker 1>you what's going to happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1040
01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:35.160
<v Speaker 1>you do something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a psychogenic epileptic seizure</v>

1041
01:06:35.260 --> 01:06:36.093
<v Speaker 1>and a variety of other symptoms there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The consequence of a very complex </v>

1042
01:06:41.710 --> 01:06:42.543
<v Speaker 1>complex in in union terms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a secondary motivation and </v>

1043
01:06:45.791 --> 01:06:49.240
<v Speaker 1>Friday in terms you go through with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole routine,</v>

1044
01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:53.020
<v Speaker 1>then you end up in a psych hospital and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you see four experts and they tell you a</v>

1045
01:06:53.021 --> 01:06:53.854
<v Speaker 1>paranoid schizophrenia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you really think you're going to not </v>

1046
01:06:55.571 --> 01:06:58.360
<v Speaker 1>believe that or at least 10% of you is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to believe it.</v>

1047
01:06:58.361 --> 01:06:59.194
<v Speaker 1>You're going to wonder after that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if another 20 people tell you that </v>

1048
01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:05.080
<v Speaker 1>and you're put on medication,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you could easily be,</v>

1049
01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:06.273
<v Speaker 1>then a year later while you might still </v>
<v Speaker 1>not have paranoid schizophrenia but you </v>

1050
01:07:09.041 --> 01:07:11.830
<v Speaker 1>are not going to be doing very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1051
01:07:14.930 --> 01:07:15.763
<v Speaker 1>well that's a good example of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens when your self concept and </v>

1052
01:07:18.621 --> 01:07:23.060
<v Speaker 1>you're organismic valuing systems aren't</v>
<v Speaker 1>working carefully in tandem</v>

1053
01:07:24.890 --> 01:07:25.723
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So someone might be telling me a story </v>

1054
01:07:28.281 --> 01:07:28.791
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1055
01:07:28.791 --> 01:07:29.624
<v Speaker 1>like a story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a story about something terrible that </v>

1056
01:07:31.311 --> 01:07:34.460
<v Speaker 1>happened to them and like I'll just be </v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting there like a brick wall.</v>

1057
01:07:34.461 --> 01:07:38.780
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're not effecting me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes don't tell people that.</v>

1058
01:07:38.781 --> 01:07:39.650
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why,</v>

1059
01:07:39.651 --> 01:07:41.150
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a pretty terrible story.</v>

1060
01:07:41.151 --> 01:07:43.670
<v Speaker 1>But I'm having no emotional response to </v>
<v Speaker 1>it at all.</v>

1061
01:07:43.910 --> 01:07:47.150
<v Speaker 1>Do you have any reason you have any idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>why that might be?</v>

1062
01:07:48.290 --> 01:07:49.430
<v Speaker 1>Well then maybe we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1063
01:07:49.431 --> 01:07:52.610
<v Speaker 1>often people aren't very happy when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell them that and that's fine.</v>

1064
01:07:52.611 --> 01:07:54.830
<v Speaker 1>They can be unhappy with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's perfectly okay.</v>

1065
01:07:55.580 --> 01:07:58.700
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is now they know that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's at least one person that they've</v>

1066
01:07:58.701 --> 01:08:01.160
<v Speaker 1>communicated with who's actually telling</v>
<v Speaker 1>them the truth,</v>

1067
01:08:01.850 --> 01:08:04.400
<v Speaker 1>who is actually not affected by their </v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

1068
01:08:05.060 --> 01:08:08.150
<v Speaker 1>Because look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone sits down beside you and they</v>

1069
01:08:08.151 --> 01:08:08.984
<v Speaker 1>tell you a terrible story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you're going to </v>

1070
01:08:11.421 --> 01:08:12.254
<v Speaker 1>tell them that that had no effect on you</v>
<v Speaker 1>is basically zero because really rude </v>

1071
01:08:16.310 --> 01:08:20.480
<v Speaker 1>not to be negatively affected by someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's telling you a very sad story.</v>

1072
01:08:22.220 --> 01:08:24.530
<v Speaker 1>But if you're negatively affected by it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just know a true,</v>

1073
01:08:24.531 --> 01:08:25.364
<v Speaker 1>you're not doing them any good at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All you're doing is providing them with </v>

1074
01:08:27.321 --> 01:08:28.154
<v Speaker 1>evidence to maintain what could easily </v>
<v Speaker 1>become a delusion if they worked on it </v>

1075
01:08:30.891 --> 01:08:33.470
<v Speaker 1>long enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By contrast.</v>

1076
01:08:33.471 --> 01:08:34.304
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes people will come into my </v>
<v Speaker 1>office and they'll tell me something </v>

1077
01:08:37.131 --> 01:08:40.790
<v Speaker 1>that just seems trivial and it make me </v>
<v Speaker 1>tear up.</v>

1078
01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:43.730
<v Speaker 1>So which means I can actually feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions.</v>

1079
01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:45.433
<v Speaker 1>It'll make me tear up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just something they just </v>

1080
01:08:46.761 --> 01:08:48.500
<v Speaker 1>barely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they barely alluded to.</v>

1081
01:08:48.501 --> 01:08:49.334
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got a client a while back told me </v>

1082
01:08:50.721 --> 01:08:51.554
<v Speaker 1>that we had had a session family session</v>
<v Speaker 1>where I had suggested to some of the </v>

1083
01:08:58.161 --> 01:08:58.994
<v Speaker 1>members of this person's family that </v>
<v Speaker 1>things might go better for them and </v>

1084
01:09:04.010 --> 01:09:07.430
<v Speaker 1>their child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was one of my clients,</v>

1085
01:09:07.820 --> 01:09:08.653
<v Speaker 1>if for the next two weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they practice doing was watching </v>

1086
01:09:13.191 --> 01:09:18.191
<v Speaker 1>each other's behavior during the day and</v>
<v Speaker 1>finding one thing that they could make a</v>

1087
01:09:20.151 --> 01:09:21.350
<v Speaker 1>positive comment about.</v>

1088
01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:23.030
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this isn't a game,</v>

1089
01:09:23.270 --> 01:09:25.880
<v Speaker 1>like if you play it as a game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it isn't going to work.</v>

1090
01:09:26.090 --> 01:09:26.923
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to do this properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you do is you watch and then you </v>

1091
01:09:29.481 --> 01:09:30.314
<v Speaker 1>notice when the person does something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that actually makes you feel positively </v>

1092
01:09:33.141 --> 01:09:36.890
<v Speaker 1>towards them and then you tell them you </v>
<v Speaker 1>did this.</v>

1093
01:09:36.891 --> 01:09:39.350
<v Speaker 1>It has to be specific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can't be at the end of the day.</v>

1094
01:09:39.380 --> 01:09:40.970
<v Speaker 1>While you were pretty good today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1095
01:09:41.270 --> 01:09:43.340
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not going to work and you have to</v>

1096
01:09:43.341 --> 01:09:47.180
<v Speaker 1>notice something they actually did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's usually something trivial,</v>

1097
01:09:47.181 --> 01:09:48.500
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1098
01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:49.933
<v Speaker 1>I really appreciate the fact that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>took your dirty dinner plate off the </v>

1099
01:09:55.041 --> 01:09:57.260
<v Speaker 1>table and rinsed it off and put it in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the dishwasher.</v>

1100
01:09:57.860 --> 01:09:59.360
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think that's so damn trivial.</v>

1101
01:09:59.361 --> 01:10:01.010
<v Speaker 1>It's hardly worth commenting on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1102
01:10:01.011 --> 01:10:01.490
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1103
01:10:01.490 --> 01:10:02.271
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not at all.</v>

1104
01:10:02.271 --> 01:10:04.970
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly the sort of specific </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that you comment on.</v>

1105
01:10:05.090 --> 01:10:08.600
<v Speaker 1>If it did in fact make you happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1106
01:10:08.601 --> 01:10:10.280
<v Speaker 1>when you can think about that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavioral terms,</v>

1107
01:10:10.281 --> 01:10:10.851
<v Speaker 1>you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1108
01:10:10.851 --> 01:10:15.560
<v Speaker 1>if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want someone to do something that</v>

1109
01:10:15.561 --> 01:10:18.440
<v Speaker 1>you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should tell them when they do things</v>

1110
01:10:18.441 --> 01:10:21.230
<v Speaker 1>that you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that they know what you like.</v>

1111
01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:23.960
<v Speaker 1>But of course that means that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>putting yourself on the line too,</v>

1112
01:10:23.961 --> 01:10:24.794
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if the person knows what you </v>

1113
01:10:25.611 --> 01:10:27.080
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they can withhold it from you.</v>

1114
01:10:27.081 --> 01:10:29.300
<v Speaker 1>And so you're not going to do that </v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you trust them.</v>

1115
01:10:29.450 --> 01:10:31.160
<v Speaker 1>You're really not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

1116
01:10:31.161 --> 01:10:31.994
<v Speaker 1>you might be in a relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might be in a marriage where never </v>

1117
01:10:35.181 --> 01:10:36.014
<v Speaker 1>once during the whole bloody marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever tell the other person what </v>

1118
01:10:38.391 --> 01:10:40.370
<v Speaker 1>actually makes you happy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's,</v>

1119
01:10:40.430 --> 01:10:41.263
<v Speaker 1>that's stupid by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like if you want to have a really </v>

1120
01:10:44.061 --> 01:10:46.430
<v Speaker 1>miserable time of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an excellent way to start.</v>

1121
01:10:46.430 --> 01:10:47.263
<v Speaker 1>You could also add to that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>presumption that if they really loved </v>

1122
01:10:49.791 --> 01:10:51.050
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know what you liked,</v>

1123
01:10:51.170 --> 01:10:52.003
<v Speaker 1>which is also what</v>
<v Speaker 1>your partners no smarter than you </v>

1124
01:10:59.060 --> 01:11:02.180
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking and you don't have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>clue what it's going to make them happy.</v>

1125
01:11:02.181 --> 01:11:03.950
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know why you'd expect them </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1126
01:11:04.100 --> 01:11:04.933
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're male,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while you'd expect them to return the </v>

1127
01:11:07.311 --> 01:11:10.100
<v Speaker 1>favor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you teach them,</v>

1128
01:11:10.101 --> 01:11:12.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like probably take four years.</v>

1129
01:11:12.141 --> 01:11:15.480
<v Speaker 1>It's like I like when you do this and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then of course they won't.</v>

1130
01:11:15.481 --> 01:11:17.460
<v Speaker 1>So you might have to mention it again in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a month.</v>

1131
01:11:17.461 --> 01:11:18.061
<v Speaker 1>You might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1132
01:11:18.061 --> 01:11:21.690
<v Speaker 1>it's going to take 18 months to train </v>
<v Speaker 1>this person at least,</v>

1133
01:11:21.691 --> 01:11:22.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're smart,</v>

1134
01:11:23.250 --> 01:11:25.590
<v Speaker 1>they're smarter than a dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not much smarter.</v>

1135
01:11:25.591 --> 01:11:26.424
<v Speaker 1>So you have to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to use repetition and you have </v>

1136
01:11:28.951 --> 01:11:30.900
<v Speaker 1>to be judicious about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you do that,</v>

1137
01:11:31.090 --> 01:11:31.923
<v Speaker 1>and now that person is also doing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>to you and you both know that you're </v>

1138
01:11:34.141 --> 01:11:34.974
<v Speaker 1>doing that and you're both trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make things better than you're going to </v>

1139
01:11:37.981 --> 01:11:39.750
<v Speaker 1>communicate about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then with any luck,</v>

1140
01:11:39.751 --> 01:11:42.570
<v Speaker 1>things will get better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that means you actually have to want</v>

1141
01:11:42.571 --> 01:11:43.530
<v Speaker 1>things to get better.</v>

1142
01:11:45.660 --> 01:11:47.220
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of the problem of </v>
<v Speaker 1>course,</v>

1143
01:11:47.221 --> 01:11:49.350
<v Speaker 1>because not everybody wants things to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get better.</v>

1144
01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:50.573
<v Speaker 1>And there's a part of everyone that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be just as happy if they didn't </v>

1145
01:11:52.321 --> 01:11:55.640
<v Speaker 1>get better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

1146
01:11:57.650 --> 01:11:58.483
<v Speaker 1>Roger's idea is that if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate properly with the person </v>

1147
01:12:02.991 --> 01:12:03.824
<v Speaker 1>that you're in the relationship with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can model proper being in some </v>

1148
01:12:07.461 --> 01:12:08.294
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that at least you can attempt </v>

1149
01:12:10.011 --> 01:12:11.600
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then as you attempt it,</v>

1150
01:12:11.601 --> 01:12:14.300
<v Speaker 1>you'll get better and better at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as you get better at it,</v>

1151
01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:16.940
<v Speaker 1>the other person will get better at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that works too.</v>

1152
01:12:17.510 --> 01:12:20.480
<v Speaker 1>So I had a client who was very anxious </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

1153
01:12:20.481 --> 01:12:21.314
<v Speaker 1>So when the person first came to see me </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they couldn't even talk on the </v>

1154
01:12:24.111 --> 01:12:27.500
<v Speaker 1>phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now they're doing,</v>

1155
01:12:29.270 --> 01:12:31.550
<v Speaker 1>they're acting publicly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're acting in public.</v>

1156
01:12:32.210 --> 01:12:35.110
<v Speaker 1>And that's been the consequence of about</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven years of,</v>

1157
01:12:35.540 --> 01:12:40.540
<v Speaker 1>I would say Rogerian conversations were </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost all that I did was listen,</v>

1158
01:12:42.860 --> 01:12:43.693
<v Speaker 1>now the uncover,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't quite get the unconditional </v>

1159
01:12:46.671 --> 01:12:47.504
<v Speaker 1>positive regard thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I know white rodgers said it </v>

1160
01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:50.833
<v Speaker 1>and his idea that arbitrary conditions </v>
<v Speaker 1>of worth can make someone pathological </v>

1161
01:12:54.261 --> 01:12:56.150
<v Speaker 1>or true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

1162
01:12:57.820 --> 01:12:58.653
<v Speaker 1>I think a more nuanced sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconditional positive regard is what </v>

1163
01:13:01.331 --> 01:13:02.164
<v Speaker 1>happens when you watch the person and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they tell you something and as they're </v>

1164
01:13:04.151 --> 01:13:04.984
<v Speaker 1>telling it to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see a little part of them sort </v>

1165
01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:08.073
<v Speaker 1>of come alive and that often happens </v>
<v Speaker 1>when their face loses a fair bit of its </v>

1166
01:13:12.191 --> 01:13:15.640
<v Speaker 1>rigidity and you can see more of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were like when they were a child,</v>

1167
01:13:15.641 --> 01:13:18.400
<v Speaker 1>sort of peeping through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So their face sort of opens up.</v>

1168
01:13:18.550 --> 01:13:21.340
<v Speaker 1>You can think a hot that was really good</v>
<v Speaker 1>for that person.</v>

1169
01:13:21.341 --> 01:13:22.174
<v Speaker 1>Whatever they've been telling me that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd be doing that was right on the </v>

1170
01:13:24.341 --> 01:13:25.600
<v Speaker 1>right track.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you can say,</v>

1171
01:13:25.601 --> 01:13:26.434
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I noticed that when you talked about </v>

1172
01:13:27.311 --> 01:13:28.144
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1173
01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:29.920
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your face for the ox do,</v>

1174
01:13:29.930 --> 01:13:31.660
<v Speaker 1>you didn't look as anxious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were smiling,</v>

1175
01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:33.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was a genuine smile.</v>

1176
01:13:33.671 --> 01:13:34.504
<v Speaker 1>And for like a second or two there you </v>
<v Speaker 1>looked like you were doing well and you </v>

1177
01:13:36.791 --> 01:13:37.624
<v Speaker 1>were happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1178
01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:41.170
<v Speaker 1>let's do a bunch more of that because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1179
01:13:41.171 --> 01:13:44.230
<v Speaker 1>if you see in someone that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>capable of experiencing that,</v>

1180
01:13:44.860 --> 01:13:48.040
<v Speaker 1>then you could help them experience that</v>
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>

1181
01:13:48.700 --> 01:13:51.430
<v Speaker 1>And that's the purpose of a longterm </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship</v>

1182
01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:53.833
<v Speaker 2>is that</v>

1183
01:13:54.830 --> 01:13:55.663
<v Speaker 1>you have your weaknesses and </v>
<v Speaker 1>inadequacies and you can't think the </v>

1184
01:13:59.050 --> 01:14:02.720
<v Speaker 1>think yourself out of them by yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because they colored the way that</v>

1185
01:14:02.721 --> 01:14:03.554
<v Speaker 1>you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you need somebody else to bang </v>

1186
01:14:05.181 --> 01:14:06.014
<v Speaker 1>yourself up against to contend with so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that all the knots in your soul can get </v>

1187
01:14:10.281 --> 01:14:13.750
<v Speaker 1>ironed out and you're doing the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing for the other person.</v>

1188
01:14:13.751 --> 01:14:15.970
<v Speaker 1>And then both of you are on an upward </v>
<v Speaker 1>spiral.</v>

1189
01:14:16.220 --> 01:14:21.010
<v Speaker 1>And in some sense that's the core theory</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Rogerian psychotherapy.</v>

1190
01:14:21.790 --> 01:14:26.710
<v Speaker 1>It's like genuine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>honest communication can heal people and</v>

1191
01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:31.510
<v Speaker 1>genuinely disown his communication can </v>
<v Speaker 1>make them pathological.</v>

1192
01:14:31.540 --> 01:14:34.900
<v Speaker 1>And</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense,</v>

1193
01:14:34.901 --> 01:14:39.901
<v Speaker 1>I think Roger's got closer to the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you invert Rogers presupposition,</v>

1194
01:14:41.431 --> 01:14:42.264
<v Speaker 1>that's as close to the truth as any </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapist is gone to see makes </v>

1195
01:14:46.731 --> 01:14:49.480
<v Speaker 1>people pathological.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's true.</v>

1196
01:14:50.590 --> 01:14:52.450
<v Speaker 1>A lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you'll notice this as well,</v>

1197
01:14:52.570 --> 01:14:53.403
<v Speaker 1>a lot of what you're doing in </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapy and in any genuine </v>

1198
01:14:55.271 --> 01:14:59.410
<v Speaker 1>relationship is a moral endeavor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to make things better,</v>

1199
01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:05.880
<v Speaker 1>and if the other person is deceiving </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves or lying or failing to become</v>

1200
01:15:05.921 --> 01:15:07.770
<v Speaker 1>aware of things that they should become </v>
<v Speaker 1>aware of,</v>

1201
01:15:07.930 --> 01:15:08.763
<v Speaker 1>they're going to get bent and twisted </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of shape and then they're not going </v>

1202
01:15:11.501 --> 01:15:12.334
<v Speaker 1>to be congruent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>congruent with their body or with the </v>

1203
01:15:13.631 --> 01:15:14.464
<v Speaker 1>broader world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they're going to suffer and </v>

1204
01:15:16.811 --> 01:15:17.644
<v Speaker 1>then that will cascade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then all sorts of things will start to </v>

1205
01:15:19.241 --> 01:15:20.150
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1206
01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:24.160
<v Speaker 1>that's the past to perdition and an </v>
<v Speaker 1>involuntary trip to the underworld.</v>

1207
01:15:26.350 --> 01:15:27.183
<v Speaker 1>When we meet again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'll show you a little clip of </v>

1208
01:15:29.621 --> 01:15:34.180
<v Speaker 1>Rogerian psychotherapy because a woman </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the 1950s agreed to be filmed,</v>

1209
01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:36.580
<v Speaker 1>which had a dramatic effect on her life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

1210
01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:37.793
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1211
01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:38.711
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it presented,</v>

1212
01:15:38.711 --> 01:15:39.544
<v Speaker 1>provides a nice</v>
<v Speaker 1>real world illustration of what Rogers </v>

1213
01:15:43.541 --> 01:15:45.750
<v Speaker 1>is doing when he's trying to listen.</v>
