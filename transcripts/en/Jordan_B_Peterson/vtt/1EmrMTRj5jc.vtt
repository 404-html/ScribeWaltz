<v Speaker 1>so excellent.</v>

4
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.313
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

5
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.130
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well thanks guys for tuning in and,</v>

6
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.173
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again for offering support for the </v>

7
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.100
<v Speaker 1>continued operation of my youtube </v>
<v Speaker 1>channel.</v>

8
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:30.563
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

9
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.200
<v Speaker 1>let's get going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

10
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.870
<v Speaker 1>it's good to see all of you and so I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>got a set of questions here.</v>

11
00:00:36.871 --> 00:00:38.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can see the,</v>

12
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.340
<v Speaker 1>the live stream as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the live chat,</v>

13
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.540
<v Speaker 1>so that's great.</v>

14
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.043
<v Speaker 2>Hm.</v>

15
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.500
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's try this one.</v>

16
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.633
<v Speaker 1>What's an effective way to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to match your career with your </v>

17
00:00:57.781 --> 00:01:00.510
<v Speaker 1>temperament?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can you determine if a job is a good</v>

18
00:01:00.511 --> 00:01:03.300
<v Speaker 1>fit or a terrible mistake?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's start with the first one.</v>

19
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.650
<v Speaker 1>What's a good way of,</v>

20
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:07.503
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

21
00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:14.163
<v Speaker 1>what's an effective way to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to match your career with your </v>

22
00:01:15.671 --> 00:01:17.410
<v Speaker 1>temperament?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

23
00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:18.813
<v Speaker 1>the first thing you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously you have to do is to </v>

24
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.870
<v Speaker 1>understand your temperament to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree.</v>

25
00:01:22.871 --> 00:01:25.180
<v Speaker 1>And so the best way to deal with that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

26
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get yourself assessed using a good,</v>

27
00:01:28.121 --> 00:01:30.220
<v Speaker 1>big five instrument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's many of them online.</v>

28
00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.413
<v Speaker 1>We're going to be setting up a website </v>
<v Speaker 1>within the next month that will enable </v>

29
00:01:33.671 --> 00:01:38.671
<v Speaker 1>people to do use a tool that a student </v>
<v Speaker 1>of mine,</v>

30
00:01:39.701 --> 00:01:40.534
<v Speaker 1>Colin de Young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's now a professor at the University </v>

31
00:01:41.861 --> 00:01:45.730
<v Speaker 1>of Minnesota and I and some other </v>
<v Speaker 1>coauthors developed back in,</v>

32
00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.020
<v Speaker 1>I think it was 2007 called the big five </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspects scale and it breaks the big five</v>

33
00:01:50.021 --> 00:01:53.380
<v Speaker 1>down into 10 aspects and we'll have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>version of that online,</v>

34
00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:54.363
<v Speaker 1>I hope by the end of July.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the plan that will enable people </v>

35
00:01:56.501 --> 00:02:01.501
<v Speaker 1>to get a read of their temperament that </v>
<v Speaker 1>will tell them how extroverted they are,</v>

36
00:02:02.771 --> 00:02:05.440
<v Speaker 1>how high they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a negative emotion or neuroticism,</v>

37
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.720
<v Speaker 1>how agreeable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how conscientious in how open.</v>

38
00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.590
<v Speaker 1>But it will break each of those traits </v>
<v Speaker 1>down into two aspects.</v>

39
00:02:11.591 --> 00:02:15.160
<v Speaker 1>So extroversion breaks into enthusiasm </v>
<v Speaker 1>and assertiveness.</v>

40
00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.940
<v Speaker 1>Neuroticism breaks into withdrawal and </v>
<v Speaker 1>volatility.</v>

41
00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.000
<v Speaker 1>Agreeableness breaks down into </v>
<v Speaker 1>politeness and compassion,</v>

42
00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:23.163
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness into orderliness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>industrious and openness into openness </v>

43
00:02:26.441 --> 00:02:27.274
<v Speaker 1>proper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is something like creativity and </v>

44
00:02:28.271 --> 00:02:29.104
<v Speaker 1>interest in ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the first thing you have to know </v>

45
00:02:31.601 --> 00:02:32.434
<v Speaker 1>is what your temperament is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second thing you should probably </v>

46
00:02:34.661 --> 00:02:35.494
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we'll probably add this </v>

47
00:02:36.161 --> 00:02:38.290
<v Speaker 1>functionality to the system at at some </v>
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>

48
00:02:38.291 --> 00:02:40.870
<v Speaker 1>is what your intelligence level is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what your acu is.</v>

49
00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.840
<v Speaker 1>Because the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the higher your Iq,</v>

50
00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.140
<v Speaker 1>the better suited you are for jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's demands change rapidly and most.</v>

51
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:50.713
<v Speaker 1>So those are complex jobs and simple </v>
<v Speaker 1>jobs are the jobs where you can learn </v>

52
00:02:53.651 --> 00:02:56.380
<v Speaker 1>something and then you can run it as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>algorithm.</v>

53
00:02:56.381 --> 00:02:58.120
<v Speaker 1>You can just repeat it over and over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those,</v>

54
00:02:58.121 --> 00:03:00.310
<v Speaker 1>those jobs of course becoming more and </v>
<v Speaker 1>more scarce.</v>

55
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.410
<v Speaker 1>So you need to know what your </v>
<v Speaker 1>temperament is and then you need to know</v>

56
00:03:05.411 --> 00:03:08.350
<v Speaker 1>the temperamental demands of the job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

57
00:03:08.351 --> 00:03:09.184
<v Speaker 1>most jobs are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are mastered with a combination of </v>

58
00:03:12.611 --> 00:03:17.611
<v Speaker 1>intelligence and conscientiousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the other temperamental factors play</v>

59
00:03:18.161 --> 00:03:20.680
<v Speaker 1>a moderating role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

60
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.053
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extroverted people tend to be </v>

61
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.770
<v Speaker 1>entertainer types and highly social.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're interested,</v>

62
00:03:28.811 --> 00:03:31.030
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're extroverted,</v>

63
00:03:31.031 --> 00:03:31.864
<v Speaker 1>then a career in sales is something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might consider a career that </v>

64
00:03:34.451 --> 00:03:37.210
<v Speaker 1>involves a lot of public communication </v>
<v Speaker 1>and interaction with groups.</v>

65
00:03:37.211 --> 00:03:38.680
<v Speaker 1>Whereas you're an introvert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to work,</v>

66
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.390
<v Speaker 1>you're going to want to work a lot more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

67
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.570
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be suited to work on s </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a solitary manner a lot more.</v>

68
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.943
<v Speaker 1>If you're agreeable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be suited for taking </v>

69
00:03:50.171 --> 00:03:52.000
<v Speaker 1>care of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're disagreeable,</v>

70
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.360
<v Speaker 1>then you're a tough bargainer and a hard</v>
<v Speaker 1>negotiator.</v>

71
00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.570
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Ah,</v>

72
00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:58.780
<v Speaker 1>litigators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

73
00:03:58.781 --> 00:04:00.080
<v Speaker 1>lawyers are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

74
00:04:00.081 --> 00:04:01.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often low in agreeableness.</v>

75
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:05.380
<v Speaker 1>So if you're conscientious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

76
00:04:05.381 --> 00:04:06.214
<v Speaker 1>that tends to be a very good trait for </v>
<v Speaker 1>any kind of managerial and </v>

77
00:04:08.231 --> 00:04:10.150
<v Speaker 1>administrative job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for,</v>

78
00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.580
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for simpler jobs as well.</v>

79
00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:13.443
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a great predictor of military </v>

80
00:04:14.471 --> 00:04:15.550
<v Speaker 1>prowess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example.</v>

81
00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.940
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're high in openness,</v>

82
00:04:18.941 --> 00:04:19.774
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to want a creative </v>
<v Speaker 1>career and that might make you an </v>

83
00:04:21.521 --> 00:04:25.360
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneur or musician or an artist of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that or something like that.</v>

84
00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:26.890
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's often very,</v>

85
00:04:26.891 --> 00:04:28.780
<v Speaker 1>very difficult to monetize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

86
00:04:28.781 --> 00:04:29.614
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the funny things about openness </v>

87
00:04:30.971 --> 00:04:31.804
<v Speaker 1>is that if you're high in openness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that helpful at the bottom of </v>

88
00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:35.103
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies because you're basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>expected at the bottom of most </v>

89
00:04:37.721 --> 00:04:40.360
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies to act more or less like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>functionary.</v>

90
00:04:40.361 --> 00:04:43.600
<v Speaker 1>But it becomes of critical importance at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the top of hierarchy.</v>

91
00:04:43.601 --> 00:04:44.434
<v Speaker 1>So it's a personality trait whose </v>
<v Speaker 1>utility can really kick in in the later </v>

92
00:04:47.471 --> 00:04:48.304
<v Speaker 1>stages of your career because in really </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex positions where things are </v>

93
00:04:52.061 --> 00:04:54.700
<v Speaker 1>changing dynamically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to have a high intelligence and</v>

94
00:04:54.701 --> 00:04:56.560
<v Speaker 1>you also need to be creative.</v>

95
00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.850
<v Speaker 1>So how can you determine if a job is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good fit or a terrible mistake?</v>

96
00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:02.350
<v Speaker 1>Ha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

97
00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.963
<v Speaker 1>I would say you can tell if it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible mistake if you dread going and </v>

98
00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:08.613
<v Speaker 1>also if you're working hard and doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're supposed to and you're not </v>

99
00:05:11.621 --> 00:05:14.800
<v Speaker 1>being rewarded for it or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's no chance for advancement so</v>

100
00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.630
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are good reasons to,</v>

101
00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to leave.</v>

102
00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so all right.</v>

103
00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.973
<v Speaker 1>Truck playing says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just wanted to tell you that you're the </v>

104
00:05:25.691 --> 00:05:28.120
<v Speaker 1>first person to actually make me read </v>
<v Speaker 1>books.</v>

105
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:29.860
<v Speaker 1>I have a background in math and </v>
<v Speaker 1>engineering,</v>

106
00:05:29.861 --> 00:05:32.020
<v Speaker 1>lots of formulas and equations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep up your work.</v>

107
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:33.490
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good work truck plane.</v>

108
00:05:33.491 --> 00:05:36.580
<v Speaker 1>There's some real utility in reading </v>
<v Speaker 1>books and I'm glad that you found the,</v>

109
00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:37.740
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

110
00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad that you figured out why it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary to do that.</v>

111
00:05:40.991 --> 00:05:42.370
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's uh,</v>

112
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.870
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

113
00:05:44.871 --> 00:05:45.704
<v Speaker 1>I'm very happy to hear that all of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>connor says it's definitely worth doing </v>

114
00:05:48.581 --> 00:05:49.300
<v Speaker 1>the humanities.</v>

115
00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.133
<v Speaker 1>It gives you a skillset you can apply </v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere that's actually worth </v>

116
00:05:52.091 --> 00:05:52.924
<v Speaker 1>elaborating on a little bit because I do</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that classical humanities </v>

117
00:05:56.651 --> 00:06:00.120
<v Speaker 1>education is at the core of the proper </v>
<v Speaker 1>university curriculum.</v>

118
00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:01.040
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

119
00:06:01.041 --> 00:06:04.640
<v Speaker 1>what's the utility for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in studying philosophy and literature?</v>

120
00:06:04.641 --> 00:06:06.530
<v Speaker 1>But that's not exactly the right way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at it.</v>

121
00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:11.150
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the utility of humanities education,</v>

122
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.730
<v Speaker 1>at least in principle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that it teaches you,</v>

123
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:16.100
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to be civilized and educated so that</v>

124
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:17.053
<v Speaker 1>you become aware of the major cultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>works that every educated person needs </v>

125
00:06:20.841 --> 00:06:21.674
<v Speaker 1>to be aware of in order to operate </v>
<v Speaker 1>properly at a high level of </v>

126
00:06:24.771 --> 00:06:25.604
<v Speaker 1>functionality in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what you'll find is that as you get </v>

127
00:06:27.591 --> 00:06:30.290
<v Speaker 1>older and you climb hierarchies of </v>
<v Speaker 1>competence,</v>

128
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:35.710
<v Speaker 1>that broader and broader educational </v>
<v Speaker 1>familiarity is demanded of you.</v>

129
00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:36.913
<v Speaker 1>But more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>education in the humanities is designed </v>

130
00:06:39.981 --> 00:06:43.850
<v Speaker 1>to teach you how to think and to speak </v>
<v Speaker 1>and to formulate arguments.</v>

131
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:44.683
<v Speaker 1>And because what you're doing in complex</v>
<v Speaker 1>positions almost always involves the </v>

132
00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:50.323
<v Speaker 1>identification of problems and their </v>
<v Speaker 1>articulation so that you can frame the </v>

133
00:06:53.181 --> 00:06:56.180
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then a description of a potential set of</v>

134
00:06:56.181 --> 00:06:57.014
<v Speaker 1>solutions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the communication of those set </v>

135
00:06:58.881 --> 00:06:59.714
<v Speaker 1>of solutions to a wide variety of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a manner that can help them obtain a </v>

136
00:07:03.021 --> 00:07:03.854
<v Speaker 1>consensus and work together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll set those skills are absolutely </v>

137
00:07:06.591 --> 00:07:09.230
<v Speaker 1>crucial when you're doing anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a real difficulty.</v>

138
00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.620
<v Speaker 1>And so the humanities education is </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily important as a,</v>

139
00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:14.660
<v Speaker 1>as a consequence of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

140
00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.300
<v Speaker 1>here's a question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Piaget's final stage of morality.</v>

141
00:07:18.301 --> 00:07:22.130
<v Speaker 1>It was he who can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who you can create the rules.</v>

142
00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:24.950
<v Speaker 1>Would you please provide an example of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what that means?</v>

143
00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:26.181
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

144
00:07:26.181 --> 00:07:27.080
<v Speaker 1>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can.</v>

145
00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:28.920
<v Speaker 1>It says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

146
00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:31.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm having trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't get the rest of it,</v>

147
00:07:31.641 --> 00:07:32.474
<v Speaker 1>but can you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you please provide an example of </v>

148
00:07:34.251 --> 00:07:34.880
<v Speaker 1>what that means?</v>

149
00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at,</v>

150
00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.860
<v Speaker 1>at a lower stage of Piaget and </v>
<v Speaker 1>development,</v>

151
00:07:39.861 --> 00:07:42.470
<v Speaker 1>let's say where you're a child and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've learned to play a game,</v>

152
00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:43.693
<v Speaker 1>you're going to determine morality on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the basis of how well you as a player </v>

153
00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:50.473
<v Speaker 1>adhere to the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now at the point of development above </v>

154
00:07:54.201 --> 00:07:56.450
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start to understand that well,</v>

155
00:07:56.451 --> 00:08:00.590
<v Speaker 1>the rules were actually a human creation</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in their original form.</v>

156
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:04.280
<v Speaker 1>And that what that means is that when </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's necessary,</v>

157
00:08:04.281 --> 00:08:07.460
<v Speaker 1>the rules can be adjusted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about the Harry Potter series.</v>

158
00:08:07.461 --> 00:08:08.294
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that characterizes </v>

159
00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:12.950
<v Speaker 1>Harry and his friends is that there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>her mind,</v>

160
00:08:12.951 --> 00:08:16.880
<v Speaker 1>he's a really good example of this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're sufficiently disciplined.</v>

161
00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:19.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she happens to be really disciplined and</v>

162
00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.710
<v Speaker 1>are perfectly capable of following the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rules,</v>

163
00:08:21.711 --> 00:08:25.670
<v Speaker 1>but also make exceptions when that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary.</v>

164
00:08:25.671 --> 00:08:26.504
<v Speaker 1>And it's the fact that they can step </v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond the rules when that becomes </v>

165
00:08:28.701 --> 00:08:29.270
<v Speaker 1>necessary.</v>

166
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:31.760
<v Speaker 1>That actually makes them the heroes of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the adventure.</v>

167
00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:32.983
<v Speaker 1>Because it's very difficult to set up a </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation where you can always act </v>

168
00:08:37.281 --> 00:08:41.060
<v Speaker 1>perfectly only by following the rules </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's very difficult to delineate</v>

169
00:08:41.061 --> 00:08:41.894
<v Speaker 1>out a rule set that sufficiently </v>
<v Speaker 1>comprehensive so it'll cover every </v>

170
00:08:44.181 --> 00:08:46.310
<v Speaker 1>eventuality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the,</v>

171
00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:49.630
<v Speaker 1>that's the upshot on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

172
00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:53.840
<v Speaker 1>women have a tendency to prefer bad men </v>
<v Speaker 1>higher in dark triad traits.</v>

173
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:54.823
<v Speaker 1>How come?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Bible describes mode of being as </v>

174
00:08:55.951 --> 00:08:58.470
<v Speaker 1>associated with Nice guy traits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which contradict that.</v>

175
00:08:58.650 --> 00:08:59.483
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I take issue with both elements of </v>

176
00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:02.574
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

177
00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:03.443
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that women do have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tendency to prefer d bad men higher in </v>

178
00:09:06.481 --> 00:09:07.314
<v Speaker 1>dark triad traits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They may have a tendency to be more </v>

179
00:09:11.401 --> 00:09:16.110
<v Speaker 1>erotically attracted to men who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>capable of manifesting,</v>

180
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:18.300
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance and aggression.</v>

181
00:09:18.301 --> 00:09:19.134
<v Speaker 1>I think that the evidence for that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively clear and I don't think the </v>

182
00:09:22.051 --> 00:09:22.884
<v Speaker 1>Bible at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this describes a mode of being as </v>

183
00:09:24.631 --> 00:09:26.340
<v Speaker 1>associated with Nice guy traits.</v>

184
00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:27.673
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that that may be how it's </v>

185
00:09:30.451 --> 00:09:32.490
<v Speaker 1>classically taught,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

186
00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:37.670
<v Speaker 1>because Christ is often presented,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in more simple minded,</v>

187
00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:38.933
<v Speaker 1>very variants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not being pejorative about that </v>

188
00:09:42.151 --> 00:09:42.984
<v Speaker 1>precisely as the ultimate in Nice guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think that that's true at </v>

189
00:09:46.351 --> 00:09:47.184
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a reasonable characterization at </v>

190
00:09:48.781 --> 00:09:49.614
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you read the Gospel accounts because </v>

191
00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:54.330
<v Speaker 1>he was someone who was certainly capable</v>
<v Speaker 1>of saying very,</v>

192
00:09:54.331 --> 00:09:59.290
<v Speaker 1>very harsh things to people and was also</v>
<v Speaker 1>identified very strongly as a figure who</v>

193
00:09:59.291 --> 00:10:03.120
<v Speaker 1>was capable of using judgment and </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinguishing between what was positive</v>

194
00:10:03.121 --> 00:10:03.954
<v Speaker 1>and what was negative in that capacity </v>
<v Speaker 1>for judgment is something quite </v>

195
00:10:07.351 --> 00:10:10.170
<v Speaker 1>different than than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than the mere nice guy,</v>

196
00:10:10.171 --> 00:10:13.260
<v Speaker 1>compassion that would be associated with</v>
<v Speaker 1>high levels of trait agreeableness.</v>

197
00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:16.500
<v Speaker 1>So I think that um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

198
00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:20.910
<v Speaker 1>the idea that the ideal that's put </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward in the biblical writings,</v>

199
00:10:20.911 --> 00:10:22.650
<v Speaker 1>it's something like be harmless.</v>

200
00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:25.020
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a real misreading of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>text.</v>

201
00:10:25.021 --> 00:10:26.870
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also think that it's,</v>

202
00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:29.850
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's wrong because harmless and good are</v>

203
00:10:29.851 --> 00:10:31.860
<v Speaker 1>not the same thing at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>

204
00:10:31.861 --> 00:10:32.694
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the best ways of </v>
<v Speaker 1>characterizing like a higher order </v>

205
00:10:36.421 --> 00:10:37.254
<v Speaker 1>morality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is something that needs you </v>

206
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.630
<v Speaker 1>talked about a fair bit is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

207
00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:43.870
<v Speaker 1>and young as well with regards to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of integration of the shout,</v>

208
00:10:43.871 --> 00:10:44.704
<v Speaker 1>it was that someone whose moral has the </v>
<v Speaker 1>capability for violence and the </v>

209
00:10:48.971 --> 00:10:51.690
<v Speaker 1>capability for aggression built in and </v>
<v Speaker 1>add hand,</v>

210
00:10:51.691 --> 00:10:52.524
<v Speaker 1>but is also someone who's perfectly </v>
<v Speaker 1>capable of controlling that in a </v>

211
00:10:55.081 --> 00:10:56.940
<v Speaker 1>civilized manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that,</v>

212
00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:58.411
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

213
00:10:58.411 --> 00:11:00.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm speaking off the cuff here </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>

214
00:11:00.151 --> 00:11:02.460
<v Speaker 1>but I think that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

215
00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:06.990
<v Speaker 1>the attraction that some women have for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

216
00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:10.050
<v Speaker 1>for the sort of men who are more likely </v>
<v Speaker 1>to misbehave,</v>

217
00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:11.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

218
00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:11.993
<v Speaker 1>to act in a delinquent manner and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>forth is partly their desire to be </v>

219
00:11:17.851 --> 00:11:20.340
<v Speaker 1>associated with men who have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity for aggression.</v>

220
00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:21.353
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best of all possible worlds is when </v>

221
00:11:23.521 --> 00:11:27.150
<v Speaker 1>that capacity for aggression is </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilized and held under control.</v>

222
00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:28.253
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I would say that one of the things </v>

223
00:11:30.181 --> 00:11:35.181
<v Speaker 1>that men should do as they mature is </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformed themselves into monsters,</v>

224
00:11:35.371 --> 00:11:37.680
<v Speaker 1>but also become civilized at the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

225
00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:38.993
<v Speaker 1>And that that's exactly what you see in </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories like beauty and the beast where </v>

226
00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:42.203
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

227
00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:43.373
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ideal man starts out as a beast and </v>

228
00:11:45.211 --> 00:11:48.180
<v Speaker 1>ends up civilized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't start out as a milk salt wimp</v>

229
00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:50.640
<v Speaker 1>sort of character who you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

230
00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:53.830
<v Speaker 1>who poses no threat to anyone and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes the hero.</v>

231
00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:54.693
<v Speaker 1>That isn't how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although there are stories of that kind </v>

232
00:11:56.381 --> 00:11:58.060
<v Speaker 1>of development.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

233
00:11:58.890 --> 00:11:59.723
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the most accessible of Carl </v>

234
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.050
<v Speaker 1>Jung's books?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

235
00:12:03.051 --> 00:12:03.884
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say any of them are </v>

236
00:12:04.271 --> 00:12:05.104
<v Speaker 1>particularly accessible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although modern man in search of a soul </v>

237
00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:09.310
<v Speaker 1>is probably a good one to start with.</v>

238
00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:11.430
<v Speaker 1>That's modern man in search of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

239
00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:12.413
<v Speaker 1>of a soul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think modern man in search of his </v>

240
00:12:14.411 --> 00:12:16.480
<v Speaker 1>soul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

241
00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:18.093
<v Speaker 1>it's modern man in search of a soul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it's short and it's to the </v>

242
00:12:20.531 --> 00:12:23.080
<v Speaker 1>point and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that's a good introduction,</v>

243
00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:24.243
<v Speaker 1>which has been the most impactful to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably I on a I o n which is the </v>

244
00:12:28.631 --> 00:12:29.464
<v Speaker 1>second volume,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the second volume of volume nine of the </v>

245
00:12:33.071 --> 00:12:35.200
<v Speaker 1>collected works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an absolutely amazing,</v>

246
00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:36.890
<v Speaker 1>terrifying book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

247
00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.850
<v Speaker 1>which describes it actually it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it acts,</v>

248
00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:40.733
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it contains some of young's writings on </v>

249
00:12:42.011 --> 00:12:42.844
<v Speaker 1>the psychology of astrology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are actually quite interesting </v>

250
00:12:44.981 --> 00:12:49.981
<v Speaker 1>because he regarded astrology as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>millennia long as millennia,</v>

251
00:12:50.561 --> 00:12:54.490
<v Speaker 1>long fantasizing on the part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>collective human imagination.</v>

252
00:12:54.491 --> 00:12:57.100
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and spend a lot of time in analyzing the</v>

253
00:12:57.101 --> 00:12:59.770
<v Speaker 1>content of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might think about it as a dream that</v>

254
00:12:59.771 --> 00:13:01.450
<v Speaker 1>was projected out into the cosmos.</v>

255
00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:02.673
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are your personal strategies for </v>

256
00:13:05.951 --> 00:13:07.830
<v Speaker 1>consuming the news?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

257
00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:09.071
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

258
00:13:09.071 --> 00:13:09.904
<v Speaker 1>it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For years I haven't watched television </v>

259
00:13:11.591 --> 00:13:12.424
<v Speaker 1>news for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't read newspapers very often </v>

260
00:13:14.081 --> 00:13:16.870
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to actually limit my exposure to</v>

261
00:13:16.871 --> 00:13:18.280
<v Speaker 1>the news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

262
00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:21.670
<v Speaker 1>I read the economist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to read Harper's magazine.</v>

263
00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:23.020
<v Speaker 1>I used to read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

264
00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:24.430
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

265
00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:26.410
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Atlantic monthly as well.</v>

266
00:13:26.411 --> 00:13:28.290
<v Speaker 1>I thought they were good periodicals all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way.</v>

267
00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:31.330
<v Speaker 1>Think both of them have collapsed quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>precipitously in recent years.</v>

268
00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:33.790
<v Speaker 1>Harper's maybe not so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

269
00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:37.840
<v Speaker 1>how do I walk the line between wanting </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be informed while avoiding the danger</v>

270
00:13:37.841 --> 00:13:39.160
<v Speaker 1>of cluttering your mind?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

271
00:13:39.161 --> 00:13:40.710
<v Speaker 1>the economist helps with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

272
00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:44.650
<v Speaker 1>I think it's actually gone down hill to </v>
<v Speaker 1>some degree over recent years as well.</v>

273
00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:47.710
<v Speaker 1>But I definitely tell my clinical </v>
<v Speaker 1>clients very frequently,</v>

274
00:13:47.711 --> 00:13:48.544
<v Speaker 1>especially if they are depressed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling overwhelmed to s to limit their </v>

275
00:13:51.161 --> 00:13:55.780
<v Speaker 1>exposure to do Daily News,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly because if something's only</v>

276
00:13:55.781 --> 00:13:56.614
<v Speaker 1>relevant the day that it's published,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could make the case that it's not </v>

277
00:13:58.691 --> 00:13:59.524
<v Speaker 1>relevant at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is part of the reason why I like </v>

278
00:14:00.791 --> 00:14:01.624
<v Speaker 1>the economist because it only comes out </v>
<v Speaker 1>every week or two weeks depending on </v>

279
00:14:04.271 --> 00:14:05.104
<v Speaker 1>your subscription.</v>

280
00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:08.740
<v Speaker 1>And so it can only cover things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have enough importance to,</v>

281
00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:11.680
<v Speaker 1>to be relevant over a timeframe that </v>
<v Speaker 1>exceeds a day.</v>

282
00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:14.560
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

283
00:14:14.561 --> 00:14:16.870
<v Speaker 1>So let's see what we've got in the live </v>
<v Speaker 1>stream here.</v>

284
00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:17.853
<v Speaker 3>MMM.</v>

285
00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:22.820
<v Speaker 1>How do we revive interest in the good </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother archetype?</v>

286
00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:25.850
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good question.</v>

287
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:26.833
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a good question in part </v>

288
00:14:29.331 --> 00:14:33.680
<v Speaker 1>because it isn't really obvious to me </v>
<v Speaker 1>that young women are narrow.</v>

289
00:14:33.681 --> 00:14:37.490
<v Speaker 1>Society are told the truth about what </v>
<v Speaker 1>their lives are likely to be like.</v>

290
00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:38.653
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

291
00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:39.920
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

292
00:14:39.921 --> 00:14:40.754
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're taught both explicitly and </v>

293
00:14:44.451 --> 00:14:49.451
<v Speaker 1>implicitly that their primary interest </v>
<v Speaker 1>will be in the pursuit of a dynamic.</v>

294
00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:54.170
<v Speaker 1>And there's some real problems with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

295
00:14:54.171 --> 00:14:59.171
<v Speaker 1>The first is that the proportion of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who will have a dynamic career in</v>

296
00:15:00.651 --> 00:15:01.484
<v Speaker 1>the technical sense is actually quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>low because most people have jobs and </v>

297
00:15:04.851 --> 00:15:05.684
<v Speaker 1>not careers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even in those jobs that might be </v>

298
00:15:08.931 --> 00:15:12.740
<v Speaker 1>regarded as careers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much of the work that's done his job.</v>

299
00:15:12.741 --> 00:15:13.850
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

300
00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:14.713
<v Speaker 1>the reason that people pay you to have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>job is often because you're required to </v>

301
00:15:18.291 --> 00:15:20.930
<v Speaker 1>do things that you wouldn't do if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't being paid.</v>

302
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:24.350
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

303
00:15:24.351 --> 00:15:25.250
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

304
00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:26.143
<v Speaker 1>we glamorize the role of career and </v>
<v Speaker 1>confuse jobs with careers and assume </v>

305
00:15:32.351 --> 00:15:34.940
<v Speaker 1>that most people are going to end up </v>
<v Speaker 1>with high end careers.</v>

306
00:15:34.941 --> 00:15:37.880
<v Speaker 1>And then we also assume that most </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

307
00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:39.823
<v Speaker 1>even those who are qualified to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>high end careers are actually the sort </v>

308
00:15:43.011 --> 00:15:46.100
<v Speaker 1>of people who would like to have high </v>
<v Speaker 1>end careers if they could.</v>

309
00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:49.040
<v Speaker 1>And that's also often not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

310
00:15:49.041 --> 00:15:53.120
<v Speaker 1>I've worked very intensely with a large </v>
<v Speaker 1>population of female lawyers.</v>

311
00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:54.023
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually,</v>

312
00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:58.010
<v Speaker 1>usually partners at large law firms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

313
00:15:58.011 --> 00:16:00.680
<v Speaker 1>very successful women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually very attractive,</v>

314
00:16:00.681 --> 00:16:03.260
<v Speaker 1>very intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily conscientious,</v>

315
00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:04.663
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the sort of people who were </v>

316
00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:09.950
<v Speaker 1>outstanding in high school and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>outstanding as undergraduates.</v>

317
00:16:09.951 --> 00:16:13.490
<v Speaker 1>And then ace law school and then did </v>
<v Speaker 1>their articling perfectly and then,</v>

318
00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:14.673
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>became associates and then eventually </v>

319
00:16:16.341 --> 00:16:19.370
<v Speaker 1>entered the partner stream in the large </v>
<v Speaker 1>law firm and then became partners.</v>

320
00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:23.540
<v Speaker 1>And a huge proportion of them wake up </v>
<v Speaker 1>around 30,</v>

321
00:16:23.541 --> 00:16:24.374
<v Speaker 1>somewhere between 30 and 32 and notice </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're 65 hour days and the incredibly </v>

322
00:16:28.251 --> 00:16:30.350
<v Speaker 1>competitive environment that they happen</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be in.</v>

323
00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:31.423
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that the demands of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>career are only going to accelerate as </v>

324
00:16:34.371 --> 00:16:35.360
<v Speaker 1>they move forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

325
00:16:35.361 --> 00:16:36.720
<v Speaker 1>they're going to make a lot of money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

326
00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:37.583
<v Speaker 1>the demands on their time of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>career only going to accelerate as they </v>

327
00:16:40.641 --> 00:16:45.641
<v Speaker 1>move forward and decide quite rapidly </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's maybe not what they want.</v>

328
00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:49.400
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is they also </v>
<v Speaker 1>would like to have a life.</v>

329
00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:50.263
<v Speaker 1>They'd like to have a relationship that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they could attend to and they'd like to </v>

330
00:16:52.101 --> 00:16:55.430
<v Speaker 1>have children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the truth of the simple truth of the</v>

331
00:16:55.431 --> 00:16:56.900
<v Speaker 1>matter is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that it's very,</v>

332
00:16:56.901 --> 00:16:57.734
<v Speaker 1>very difficult to have a truly high end </v>
<v Speaker 1>career and have an important </v>

333
00:17:01.911 --> 00:17:02.744
<v Speaker 1>relationship and have children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if there are two of you </v>

334
00:17:05.031 --> 00:17:05.990
<v Speaker 1>trying to pursue that.</v>

335
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:10.100
<v Speaker 1>At the same time it's very difficult and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's difficult to have a high end career</v>

336
00:17:10.101 --> 00:17:10.934
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's also difficult to have a fully </v>

337
00:17:12.681 --> 00:17:13.514
<v Speaker 1>functional family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trying to combine those sorts of things </v>

338
00:17:15.621 --> 00:17:18.800
<v Speaker 1>makes people who are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've seen people do it,</v>

339
00:17:18.801 --> 00:17:19.600
<v Speaker 1>but man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

340
00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:23.420
<v Speaker 1>they push themselves right to their </v>
<v Speaker 1>limits and they usually have limits that</v>

341
00:17:23.421 --> 00:17:28.010
<v Speaker 1>exceed the limits of typical people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things we could do,</v>

342
00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:29.053
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to revive interest in the good mother </v>

343
00:17:30.801 --> 00:17:31.634
<v Speaker 1>archetype is to stop telling lies to </v>
<v Speaker 1>young women about what their life is </v>

344
00:17:34.341 --> 00:17:36.590
<v Speaker 1>likely to be like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because my experience has been,</v>

345
00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:37.633
<v Speaker 1>and you might think I'm old fashioned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I don't really think I am by </v>

346
00:17:39.681 --> 00:17:40.900
<v Speaker 1>the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

347
00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:41.773
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm actually quite current and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>pay a lot of attention to what's going </v>

348
00:17:44.181 --> 00:17:45.014
<v Speaker 1>on around me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my experience has been </v>

349
00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:47.233
<v Speaker 1>overwhelmingly that high caliber women </v>
<v Speaker 1>decide in their thirties that </v>

350
00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:55.440
<v Speaker 1>relationship and family is the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>important thing in their life.</v>

351
00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:59.160
<v Speaker 1>And I think the reason that the fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>that major law firms,</v>

352
00:17:59.161 --> 00:17:59.994
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a really difficult time holding on </v>

353
00:18:01.891 --> 00:18:02.724
<v Speaker 1>to their high performing women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though they bend over backwards to </v>

354
00:18:04.801 --> 00:18:07.320
<v Speaker 1>do that is actually an indication of </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly that.</v>

355
00:18:07.321 --> 00:18:08.154
<v Speaker 1>And this notion that it's a glass </v>
<v Speaker 1>ceiling in some sense that are stopping </v>

356
00:18:10.951 --> 00:18:12.780
<v Speaker 1>women from advancing up the corporate </v>
<v Speaker 1>ladder,</v>

357
00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:16.200
<v Speaker 1>I believe to be a truly erroneous as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well as dangerous.</v>

358
00:18:16.201 --> 00:18:17.550
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's really any,</v>

359
00:18:17.551 --> 00:18:20.430
<v Speaker 1>any really any evidence to support that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

360
00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:22.483
<v Speaker 1>alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fraser Burns says highly creative </v>

361
00:18:24.271 --> 00:18:27.360
<v Speaker 1>stupendously low in conscientiousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I do?</v>

362
00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:29.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

363
00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:30.053
<v Speaker 1>you're not doomed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that openness and </v>

364
00:18:31.801 --> 00:18:34.620
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness are often at odds with</v>
<v Speaker 1>one another.</v>

365
00:18:34.621 --> 00:18:35.454
<v Speaker 1>It isn't obvious to me how someone can </v>
<v Speaker 1>easily be highly creative and ordered </v>

366
00:18:39.611 --> 00:18:40.441
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

367
00:18:40.441 --> 00:18:45.441
<v Speaker 1>because to be creative means to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>some disorder in the intermediary stages</v>

368
00:18:46.111 --> 00:18:48.090
<v Speaker 1>of being a creative person.</v>

369
00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:49.853
<v Speaker 1>I would say also that many creative </v>
<v Speaker 1>enterprises are not the sort of thing </v>

370
00:18:54.091 --> 00:18:57.630
<v Speaker 1>that anybody who was sensible from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective of being conscientious,</v>

371
00:18:57.810 --> 00:19:01.620
<v Speaker 1>conscientious would ever pursue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the the lifestyle of a musician for</v>

372
00:19:01.621 --> 00:19:05.220
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say though that if you're low in</v>

373
00:19:05.221 --> 00:19:07.500
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness and really high in </v>
<v Speaker 1>openness,</v>

374
00:19:07.501 --> 00:19:09.750
<v Speaker 1>high in creativity is that you're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to have,</v>

375
00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:13.260
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be able to generate a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of creative ideas,</v>

376
00:19:13.261 --> 00:19:15.150
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to have a hard time </v>
<v Speaker 1>implementing them.</v>

377
00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:16.343
<v Speaker 1>You won't have the follow through and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you may have to really learn to </v>

378
00:19:18.241 --> 00:19:19.074
<v Speaker 1>discipline yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say the simplest way to </v>

379
00:19:21.781 --> 00:19:22.614
<v Speaker 1>start disciplining yourself is to use </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like Google calendar to </v>

380
00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:29.070
<v Speaker 1>establish a schedule and stick to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>damn thing.</v>

381
00:19:29.071 --> 00:19:31.860
<v Speaker 1>Like train yourself to get up at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same time.</v>

382
00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:32.753
<v Speaker 1>Train yourself to eat at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Train yourself to follow a schedule so </v>

383
00:19:36.841 --> 00:19:41.310
<v Speaker 1>that you undertake the tasks that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to undertake each week on a regular</v>

384
00:19:41.311 --> 00:19:42.120
<v Speaker 1>basis.</v>

385
00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:42.953
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can leave in that a little bit </v>

386
00:19:44.851 --> 00:19:45.684
<v Speaker 1>so that it doesn't become intolerable by</v>
<v Speaker 1>using the schedule to design days that </v>

387
00:19:48.481 --> 00:19:49.314
<v Speaker 1>you would want to have instead of just </v>
<v Speaker 1>days that you should have like a </v>

388
00:19:51.811 --> 00:19:53.430
<v Speaker 1>schedule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have to be a tyrant.</v>

389
00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:55.043
<v Speaker 1>The proper use of his schedule enables </v>
<v Speaker 1>you to have the maximum amount of </v>

390
00:19:57.901 --> 00:19:58.734
<v Speaker 1>freedom while also maintaining the </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility necessary to stop your </v>

391
00:20:01.591 --> 00:20:02.424
<v Speaker 1>life from auguring into the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're high in openness and and </v>

392
00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:07.213
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in all likelihood you're fairly </v>

393
00:20:08.251 --> 00:20:09.084
<v Speaker 1>intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that happens to be the case and </v>

394
00:20:10.381 --> 00:20:11.214
<v Speaker 1>you're low in conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might be able to get the best of </v>

395
00:20:12.871 --> 00:20:14.760
<v Speaker 1>both worlds by learning to discipline </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

396
00:20:14.761 --> 00:20:16.650
<v Speaker 1>But it's going to be a step by step </v>
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>

397
00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:17.693
<v Speaker 1>And I would also say do something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the future authoring program from self </v>

398
00:20:21.061 --> 00:20:23.580
<v Speaker 1>authoring.com and even if you do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>badly,</v>

399
00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:24.443
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things that will help</v>
<v Speaker 1>you discipline yourself is to have a </v>

400
00:20:27.421 --> 00:20:31.770
<v Speaker 1>plan and a plan is this is the something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that all of you who are listening should</v>

401
00:20:31.771 --> 00:20:32.604
<v Speaker 1>know is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really recommend doing that future </v>

402
00:20:33.931 --> 00:20:34.764
<v Speaker 1>authoring program because you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will not get what you want unless </v>

403
00:20:39.121 --> 00:20:40.440
<v Speaker 1>you figure out what it is.</v>

404
00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:41.543
<v Speaker 1>You won't be as much to use to yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>and to the broader world unless you </v>

405
00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:47.040
<v Speaker 1>develop a vision and implement it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

406
00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:51.190
<v Speaker 1>and the best way to do that is to do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously.</v>

407
00:20:51.191 --> 00:20:53.650
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the best ways to do something</v>

408
00:20:53.651 --> 00:20:55.840
<v Speaker 1>seriously is to write about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

409
00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:57.283
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my goal is to be married and on my way </v>

410
00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:00.633
<v Speaker 1>to starting a family within five years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this a legitimate goal to have for </v>

411
00:21:03.281 --> 00:21:03.821
<v Speaker 1>myself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

412
00:21:03.821 --> 00:21:04.960
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

413
00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:05.823
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of these things can be made </v>

414
00:21:07.631 --> 00:21:08.560
<v Speaker 1>conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

415
00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:12.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have this romantic belief,</v>

416
00:21:12.011 --> 00:21:12.844
<v Speaker 1>I suppose that if you open yourself up </v>
<v Speaker 1>to opportunity than it will ferret you </v>

417
00:21:17.441 --> 00:21:18.274
<v Speaker 1>out in your dreams will come true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's kind of a naive way of </v>

418
00:21:20.771 --> 00:21:23.560
<v Speaker 1>looking at the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's much more likely to be the case</v>

419
00:21:23.561 --> 00:21:27.940
<v Speaker 1>that if you aim at something and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you aim carefully and thoughtfully,</v>

420
00:21:27.941 --> 00:21:28.774
<v Speaker 1>that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you will orient yourself in a </v>

421
00:21:30.761 --> 00:21:34.780
<v Speaker 1>manner that makes you aware of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunities that will arise,</v>

422
00:21:34.781 --> 00:21:36.190
<v Speaker 1>that will put you in that direction.</v>

423
00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:38.650
<v Speaker 1>That's actually how your perceptual </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems work.</v>

424
00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:39.843
<v Speaker 1>And so part of the reason that it's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>useful to Orient Yourself with regards </v>

425
00:21:42.551 --> 00:21:43.384
<v Speaker 1>to a specific game is that your </v>
<v Speaker 1>perceptual systems then turn on to tell </v>

426
00:21:47.861 --> 00:21:51.010
<v Speaker 1>you what's going to facilitate your </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement forward.</v>

427
00:21:51.011 --> 00:21:54.010
<v Speaker 1>And also what's going to get in the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

428
00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:55.263
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to be too single minded </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it because you can get obsessive </v>

429
00:21:57.670 --> 00:21:58.503
<v Speaker 1>and you also want to maintain enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>flexibility in your aim so that you can </v>

430
00:22:01.931 --> 00:22:02.764
<v Speaker 1>change them when necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's absolutely nothing wrong </v>

431
00:22:05.171 --> 00:22:07.540
<v Speaker 1>with deciding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only,</v>

432
00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:09.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over what period of,</v>

433
00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:13.990
<v Speaker 1>during what timeframe you might want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get married and when you want might want</v>

434
00:22:13.991 --> 00:22:14.824
<v Speaker 1>to have children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what kind of partner you want to </v>

435
00:22:16.001 --> 00:22:19.000
<v Speaker 1>have and what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what sort of interests you would like to</v>

436
00:22:19.001 --> 00:22:19.834
<v Speaker 1>share with them and to really specify </v>
<v Speaker 1>your life because it's much more likely </v>

437
00:22:22.871 --> 00:22:23.704
<v Speaker 1>that it's going to be turned out in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive manner for you and everybody </v>

438
00:22:25.901 --> 00:22:26.200
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

439
00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:28.330
<v Speaker 1>If you put some intelligent thought into</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

440
00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:29.343
<v Speaker 1>just like it's the case that almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything is likely to turn out better </v>

441
00:22:31.751 --> 00:22:33.250
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you do that.</v>

442
00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:35.263
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you suggest homeschooling with the </v>

443
00:22:38.051 --> 00:22:40.930
<v Speaker 1>state public schools are currently in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

444
00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:41.943
<v Speaker 1>I don't suggest it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think homeschooling is an incredibly </v>

445
00:22:44.081 --> 00:22:49.081
<v Speaker 1>difficult thing to pull off properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that there,</v>

446
00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:53.470
<v Speaker 1>I think that the number of people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>would do it badly far exceeds the number</v>

447
00:22:53.471 --> 00:22:56.050
<v Speaker 1>of people who would do it well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having said that,</v>

448
00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:59.200
<v Speaker 1>it's not like I think it's wrong and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also not like,</v>

449
00:22:59.201 --> 00:23:00.034
<v Speaker 1>I think that there isn't increasing </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason for parents to consider that </v>

450
00:23:02.711 --> 00:23:03.544
<v Speaker 1>because I do actually think there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>increasing reason for parents to </v>

451
00:23:05.501 --> 00:23:06.334
<v Speaker 1>consider that because the postmodern neo</v>
<v Speaker 1>marxists have got their claws into the </v>

452
00:23:09.461 --> 00:23:12.430
<v Speaker 1>education system and I think they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing everything they can.</v>

453
00:23:12.431 --> 00:23:13.870
<v Speaker 1>And you can certainly see that in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

454
00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:17.620
<v Speaker 1>in Canada and in Ontario where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>elementary teachers,</v>

455
00:23:17.621 --> 00:23:20.170
<v Speaker 1>Federation of Ontario has published </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

456
00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:21.640
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

457
00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:24.310
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's guideline curriculum.</v>

458
00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:25.143
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically a blueprint for transforming </v>

459
00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:29.253
<v Speaker 1>kids into social justice oriented </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals from kindergarten through </v>

460
00:23:32.201 --> 00:23:33.034
<v Speaker 1>grade eight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not surprising that people want </v>

461
00:23:34.331 --> 00:23:35.680
<v Speaker 1>to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

462
00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:37.583
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that parental rights trumps </v>

463
00:23:40.221 --> 00:23:41.054
<v Speaker 1>state rights in relationship to children</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it has to be that way even though </v>

464
00:23:43.481 --> 00:23:44.314
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of bad parents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing about bad parents is that the </v>

465
00:23:48.141 --> 00:23:51.950
<v Speaker 1>state as parent is worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like there are no bad parents,</v>

466
00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:53.113
<v Speaker 1>but to assume that the state is going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a better parent on average than </v>

467
00:23:55.971 --> 00:23:58.580
<v Speaker 1>parents who actually love their children</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a very bad idea.</v>

468
00:23:59.090 --> 00:23:59.923
<v Speaker 1>So why is Jordan Peterson's Webcam a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand times better than all of my </v>

469
00:24:05.181 --> 00:24:06.014
<v Speaker 1>favorite youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Youtube is with millions of subscribers </v>

470
00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:13.370
<v Speaker 1>because my son Julian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who helps me with technical matters,</v>

471
00:24:13.371 --> 00:24:14.204
<v Speaker 1>bought a Dlsr l camera dlsr camera for </v>
<v Speaker 1>me that happens to work extremely well </v>

472
00:24:19.281 --> 00:24:22.880
<v Speaker 1>except the battery runs out about every </v>
<v Speaker 1>hour and 15 minutes and I have to change</v>

473
00:24:22.881 --> 00:24:23.030
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

474
00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:24.210
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

475
00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:26.450
<v Speaker 1>and I think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

476
00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:30.710
<v Speaker 1>it would be nice if I could actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>plug it in with an adapter,</v>

477
00:24:30.711 --> 00:24:31.544
<v Speaker 1>but I think that that changes the </v>
<v Speaker 1>category of camera to video camera and </v>

478
00:24:34.701 --> 00:24:36.770
<v Speaker 1>then there's tax implications or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

479
00:24:36.771 --> 00:24:37.604
<v Speaker 1>So I have the high quality camera and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to put up with the fact that the </v>

480
00:24:40.671 --> 00:24:41.660
<v Speaker 1>battery dies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

481
00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:43.363
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do I plan to buffer myself from the </v>

482
00:24:45.261 --> 00:24:49.190
<v Speaker 1>deteriorating tier you're aiding side </v>
<v Speaker 1>effect of success?</v>

483
00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:52.320
<v Speaker 1>That's a really good question actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

484
00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:54.890
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you a bunch of answers to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

485
00:24:54.891 --> 00:24:55.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first is,</v>

486
00:24:55.781 --> 00:25:00.230
<v Speaker 1>is that I have a sensible family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a son and a daughter,</v>

487
00:25:00.231 --> 00:25:03.530
<v Speaker 1>and soon to be a son in law and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>daughter in law as well,</v>

488
00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:07.880
<v Speaker 1>who I like and who liked me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we get along really well and they're</v>

489
00:25:07.881 --> 00:25:10.760
<v Speaker 1>really sensible people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they help keep me,</v>

490
00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:12.470
<v Speaker 1>my feet nailed to the ground.</v>

491
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:13.303
<v Speaker 1>And so does my wife because my wife is </v>
<v Speaker 1>also an extremely sensible person and </v>

492
00:25:16.011 --> 00:25:16.844
<v Speaker 1>someone I really deeply trust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm also fortunate in that I have </v>

493
00:25:20.091 --> 00:25:23.300
<v Speaker 1>parents who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who play that role with me as well and a</v>

494
00:25:23.301 --> 00:25:25.670
<v Speaker 1>sister and a brother in law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

495
00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:27.383
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and my brother as well who helped me </v>

496
00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:32.173
<v Speaker 1>stay</v>
<v Speaker 1>attuned to the potential dangers that </v>

497
00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:41.220
<v Speaker 1>this widespread public exposure might </v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise produce.</v>

498
00:25:41.221 --> 00:25:43.970
<v Speaker 1>But so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the other issue,</v>

499
00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:46.040
<v Speaker 1>so there's that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have advisors,</v>

500
00:25:46.041 --> 00:25:48.500
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are on my side who tell me the truth</v>

501
00:25:48.501 --> 00:25:52.880
<v Speaker 1>and we discussed what I'm doing all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time to make sure that it's staying more</v>

502
00:25:52.881 --> 00:25:55.430
<v Speaker 1>or less on track.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other thing too is though,</v>

503
00:25:55.431 --> 00:25:57.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not exactly a young man anymore.</v>

504
00:25:57.891 --> 00:26:00.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm 55.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

505
00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:00.973
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of the detrimental </v>
<v Speaker 1>elements of widespread public exposure </v>

506
00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:06.613
<v Speaker 1>are things that would have been a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>more harmful or that are a lot more </v>

507
00:26:10.191 --> 00:26:11.750
<v Speaker 1>harmful to people when they're younger.</v>

508
00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:12.613
<v Speaker 1>There's just a lot of things about being</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the public eye that don't have the </v>

509
00:26:14.841 --> 00:26:19.640
<v Speaker 1>same cache to me that they might have </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was a younger person or that they</v>

510
00:26:19.641 --> 00:26:20.474
<v Speaker 1>would have to a younger person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I guess I would also say that I </v>

511
00:26:23.211 --> 00:26:26.300
<v Speaker 1>don't really believe that I'm the sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of person to let,</v>

512
00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:31.250
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not trying to put myself on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>higher moral plane or anything with this</v>

513
00:26:31.251 --> 00:26:32.930
<v Speaker 1>comment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think I'm the kind of person</v>

514
00:26:32.931 --> 00:26:37.931
<v Speaker 1>to let the sort of thing that's happened</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the last year or so really go to my</v>

515
00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:39.823
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think part of the reason for that </v>

516
00:26:40.971 --> 00:26:44.670
<v Speaker 1>is it that I have a fairly pronounced </v>
<v Speaker 1>depressive temperament and so that I can</v>

517
00:26:44.671 --> 00:26:48.690
<v Speaker 1>see the negative side of myself with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with plenty painful clarity.</v>

518
00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:49.500
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

519
00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:50.333
<v Speaker 1>I'm also more concerned about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility of making a catastrophic </v>

520
00:26:54.751 --> 00:26:55.584
<v Speaker 1>mistake as I present my self publicly </v>
<v Speaker 1>than I am in what clambering up some </v>

521
00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:05.550
<v Speaker 1>power louder I suppose in elevating </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself to a position at the top.</v>

522
00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:09.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm just not that interested in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think,</v>

523
00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:11.070
<v Speaker 1>and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm also,</v>

524
00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:11.993
<v Speaker 1>I think fairly aware of the dangers of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of well let's say fame to the degree </v>

525
00:27:17.701 --> 00:27:19.340
<v Speaker 1>that that's what's occurred to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

526
00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:27.070
<v Speaker 1>I know the downside of that and it isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that I'm interested in it,</v>

527
00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:30.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it's a strange thing but to think</v>

528
00:27:30.211 --> 00:27:31.044
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm actually also rather private </v>

529
00:27:32.311 --> 00:27:34.170
<v Speaker 1>person and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

530
00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:37.320
<v Speaker 1>although I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't keep my mouth shut obviously,</v>

531
00:27:37.321 --> 00:27:39.330
<v Speaker 1>and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very talkative.</v>

532
00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:40.433
<v Speaker 1>That's from being very high in openness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even more than being high in </v>

533
00:27:42.211 --> 00:27:44.540
<v Speaker 1>extroversion I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

534
00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:52.970
<v Speaker 1>but there isn't anything that comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>along with the dark side of fame,</v>

535
00:27:53.131 --> 00:27:53.964
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I would find particularly </v>

536
00:27:54.931 --> 00:27:56.550
<v Speaker 1>attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

537
00:27:56.551 --> 00:28:00.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm not really interested in partying </v>
<v Speaker 1>endlessly,</v>

538
00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:03.120
<v Speaker 1>although I had my time doing that when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was young.</v>

539
00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:05.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm certainly not interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

540
00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:07.613
<v Speaker 1>whatever additional attractiveness to </v>
<v Speaker 1>two females that my more well known the </v>

541
00:28:13.561 --> 00:28:14.394
<v Speaker 1>fact that I'm more my well known might </v>
<v Speaker 1>provide to me that that just doesn't </v>

542
00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:18.473
<v Speaker 1>interest me at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very happy in my marriage and also </v>

543
00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:21.713
<v Speaker 1>very aware of the catastrophes that lie </v>
<v Speaker 1>in directions of that sort of </v>

544
00:28:27.361 --> 00:28:28.440
<v Speaker 1>temptation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

545
00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:30.620
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

546
00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:33.750
<v Speaker 1>but I also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think of all those explanations,</v>

547
00:28:33.751 --> 00:28:34.584
<v Speaker 1>the one that's most relevant is my see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that I'm walking a tight rope in </v>

548
00:28:39.541 --> 00:28:40.374
<v Speaker 1>some sense and that it would be very </v>
<v Speaker 1>easy for me to make the kind of error </v>

549
00:28:43.171 --> 00:28:44.130
<v Speaker 1>that would sink me.</v>

550
00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:45.760
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm,</v>

551
00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:46.673
<v Speaker 1>I know that there are many people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't approve of what I'm doing who </v>

552
00:28:49.771 --> 00:28:54.690
<v Speaker 1>would be very happy about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think also living in a somewhat</v>

553
00:28:55.050 --> 00:29:00.050
<v Speaker 1>constant state of existential terror </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the probability that this house of</v>

554
00:29:01.141 --> 00:29:01.974
<v Speaker 1>cards could collapse is also something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that keeps me oriented in the humble </v>

555
00:29:06.391 --> 00:29:10.620
<v Speaker 1>direction and</v>
<v Speaker 1>dwelling on this a little bit.</v>

556
00:29:10.621 --> 00:29:12.270
<v Speaker 1>But it really is an interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>

557
00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:13.643
<v Speaker 1>I am also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe I also have trained myself so </v>

558
00:29:16.831 --> 00:29:17.664
<v Speaker 1>that I orient myself mostly to </v>
<v Speaker 1>considering what I'm doing wrong and </v>

559
00:29:20.641 --> 00:29:23.070
<v Speaker 1>what I couldn't be doing better than </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm doing right.</v>

560
00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:28.610
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm always on the lookout in all </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the presentations I make four where I</v>

561
00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:32.850
<v Speaker 1>didn't say things as clearly as I might </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been,</v>

562
00:29:32.851 --> 00:29:33.684
<v Speaker 1>where I could have improved my delivery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so concentrating on where what I </v>

563
00:29:37.801 --> 00:29:38.634
<v Speaker 1>have yet to attain is also a good way of</v>
<v Speaker 1>keeping whatever ego boost there might </v>

564
00:29:43.961 --> 00:29:48.010
<v Speaker 1>be in more widespread public recognition</v>
<v Speaker 1>under control.</v>

565
00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:49.660
<v Speaker 1>Having said that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very,</v>

566
00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:53.710
<v Speaker 1>it's not like I'm ungrateful for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that all this has happened.</v>

567
00:29:53.711 --> 00:29:56.290
<v Speaker 1>It's actually an amazing thrill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

568
00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:58.540
<v Speaker 1>things happen to me all the time that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

569
00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:01.660
<v Speaker 1>that are so overwhelmingly positive that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe it.</v>

570
00:30:01.661 --> 00:30:02.494
<v Speaker 1>So last night for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to this restaurant called the </v>

571
00:30:04.361 --> 00:30:05.194
<v Speaker 1>cake and I go there because I have a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of food allergies and they're actually </v>

572
00:30:07.871 --> 00:30:09.910
<v Speaker 1>very careful with people who have food </v>
<v Speaker 1>allergies.</v>

573
00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:11.580
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

574
00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:14.140
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the waiter showed us to the table and he</v>

575
00:30:14.141 --> 00:30:14.974
<v Speaker 1>knew who I was and he said that he had </v>
<v Speaker 1>been watching my videos and that he had </v>

576
00:30:17.501 --> 00:30:21.040
<v Speaker 1>had four promotions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what he's doing.</v>

577
00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:21.671
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

578
00:30:21.671 --> 00:30:24.250
<v Speaker 1>four promotions in the last four months </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the cake.</v>

579
00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:25.593
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that was that he had </v>
<v Speaker 1>been watching my lectures and decided </v>

580
00:30:28.181 --> 00:30:29.014
<v Speaker 1>that he was going to adopt a more </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsible attitude as an employee and </v>

581
00:30:31.511 --> 00:30:33.190
<v Speaker 1>also do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

582
00:30:33.191 --> 00:30:36.310
<v Speaker 1>we'll start pushing the development of </v>
<v Speaker 1>his career at this,</v>

583
00:30:36.311 --> 00:30:37.300
<v Speaker 1>at this restaurant.</v>

584
00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:38.133
<v Speaker 1>And that had worked out brilliantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like it was so positive because you </v>

585
00:30:42.071 --> 00:30:44.950
<v Speaker 1>know it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I thought about it as a true victory</v>

586
00:30:44.951 --> 00:30:48.850
<v Speaker 1>on his part because he took the </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation that he was actually in,</v>

587
00:30:48.851 --> 00:30:49.684
<v Speaker 1>so a real situation and decided that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was going to maximize the opportunity </v>

588
00:30:53.861 --> 00:30:55.840
<v Speaker 1>that was there for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

589
00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:57.670
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's negative,</v>

590
00:30:57.671 --> 00:31:00.700
<v Speaker 1>it's all positive and it's a personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

591
00:31:00.701 --> 00:31:04.420
<v Speaker 1>And he shared it with me and I had some </v>
<v Speaker 1>small role in bringing that about.</v>

592
00:31:04.421 --> 00:31:07.510
<v Speaker 1>And like that's just an absolute thrill </v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as I'm concerned.</v>

593
00:31:07.511 --> 00:31:09.340
<v Speaker 1>Like every time someone writes me and </v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

594
00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:11.453
<v Speaker 1>I've been watching your videos and I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>just decided to sort out my life and to </v>

595
00:31:14.261 --> 00:31:16.840
<v Speaker 1>aim higher and that's working,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just like,</v>

596
00:31:16.841 --> 00:31:17.674
<v Speaker 1>it's such a thrill for me to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>provide that service for hundreds of </v>

597
00:31:21.850 --> 00:31:22.390
<v Speaker 1>thousands of people.</v>

598
00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:23.950
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

599
00:31:24.610 --> 00:31:25.443
<v Speaker 1>it's an unbelievable privilege and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>hope I can figure out how to do it </v>

600
00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:32.620
<v Speaker 1>better and better as I get more and more</v>
<v Speaker 1>practiced at it.</v>

601
00:31:32.621 --> 00:31:33.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really the aim.</v>

602
00:31:33.821 --> 00:31:35.650
<v Speaker 1>And with my colleagues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

603
00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:38.020
<v Speaker 1>Daniel Higgins for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have two business partner,</v>

604
00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:38.913
<v Speaker 1>Daniel Higgins and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Robert Peale peale was my graduate </v>

605
00:31:42.971 --> 00:31:43.804
<v Speaker 1>advisor and mcgill and Daniel Higgins </v>
<v Speaker 1>was one of my graduate students at </v>

606
00:31:46.961 --> 00:31:47.794
<v Speaker 1>Harvard and we've been working on making</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological interventions accessible </v>

607
00:31:51.551 --> 00:31:52.384
<v Speaker 1>to people for about 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they helped me develop the self </v>

608
00:31:54.191 --> 00:31:56.170
<v Speaker 1>authoring suite for two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

609
00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:58.430
<v Speaker 1>we have a whole host of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

610
00:31:58.690 --> 00:32:03.370
<v Speaker 1>psychological tools in development,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including a future authoring program for</v>

611
00:32:03.371 --> 00:32:06.730
<v Speaker 1>high school students that we want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>bring to the broader general public.</v>

612
00:32:06.731 --> 00:32:10.330
<v Speaker 1>And so this public exposure also gives </v>
<v Speaker 1>me the opportunity to,</v>

613
00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:11.703
<v Speaker 1>to make what I know as a clinical </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologist and as someone with some </v>

614
00:32:15.671 --> 00:32:19.060
<v Speaker 1>specialization in technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially through my partnerships,</v>

615
00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:22.630
<v Speaker 1>make that accessible to perhaps millions</v>
<v Speaker 1>of people.</v>

616
00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:24.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

617
00:32:24.311 --> 00:32:26.320
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just an amazing opportunity.</v>

618
00:32:26.321 --> 00:32:30.580
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone asks,</v>

619
00:32:30.581 --> 00:32:34.330
<v Speaker 1>how do you find the self authoring </v>
<v Speaker 1>autobiography,</v>

620
00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:35.170
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>outline?</v>

621
00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:36.003
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go to the self authoring.com it's </v>

622
00:32:37.151 --> 00:32:38.950
<v Speaker 1>available there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

623
00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:40.483
<v Speaker 1>let's see.</v>

624
00:32:43.390 --> 00:32:44.223
<v Speaker 3>MMM,</v>

625
00:32:46.150 --> 00:32:47.600
<v Speaker 1>somewhat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at Adler says,</v>

626
00:32:47.601 --> 00:32:51.020
<v Speaker 1>I have also done better in a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things due to your kicks in the ass.</v>

627
00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:51.981
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

628
00:32:51.981 --> 00:32:52.814
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's great and that I'm thrilled to </v>

629
00:32:53.841 --> 00:32:54.674
<v Speaker 1>hear that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

630
00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:56.780
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of it,</v>

631
00:32:57.260 --> 00:32:58.093
<v Speaker 1>you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing about disciplining someone </v>

632
00:33:00.351 --> 00:33:01.184
<v Speaker 1>let's say is that when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I see this very clearly when I'm </v>

633
00:33:04.401 --> 00:33:05.234
<v Speaker 1>talking to young people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that I really on the side of the </v>

634
00:33:07.941 --> 00:33:08.774
<v Speaker 1>person that wants to do something </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive with their life to make their </v>

635
00:33:14.751 --> 00:33:15.584
<v Speaker 1>own life better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I think that's where you should </v>

636
00:33:16.671 --> 00:33:17.504
<v Speaker 1>start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should start by making maximizing </v>

637
00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:21.800
<v Speaker 1>the quality of your own life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a selfish thing.</v>

638
00:33:21.801 --> 00:33:22.634
<v Speaker 1>Or if it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the right kind of selfishness and </v>

639
00:33:24.441 --> 00:33:25.274
<v Speaker 1>that you should figure out how to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that in a way that's of benefit to your </v>

640
00:33:27.441 --> 00:33:29.150
<v Speaker 1>friends and your family and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>

641
00:33:29.150 --> 00:33:31.190
<v Speaker 1>And you should take that deadly </v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously.</v>

642
00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:32.263
<v Speaker 1>And the reason you should do that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that just makes life better for </v>

643
00:33:35.031 --> 00:33:35.864
<v Speaker 1>everyone and it re it reduces a fair bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the misery that would otherwise be </v>

644
00:33:40.311 --> 00:33:41.144
<v Speaker 1>part and parcel of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it makes everything function </v>

645
00:33:43.431 --> 00:33:45.320
<v Speaker 1>smoothly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things I'm really curious</v>

646
00:33:45.321 --> 00:33:48.350
<v Speaker 1>about is what the world would be like if</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody decided to do that.</v>

647
00:33:48.351 --> 00:33:49.184
<v Speaker 1>Because human beings are really </v>
<v Speaker 1>remarkable creatures and we humble </v>

648
00:33:51.591 --> 00:33:52.424
<v Speaker 1>ourselves very badly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With deception and resentment and </v>

649
00:33:54.651 --> 00:33:59.120
<v Speaker 1>revenge and the desire to make things </v>
<v Speaker 1>worse and arrogance and all those,</v>

650
00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:01.550
<v Speaker 1>all those sins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say that,</v>

651
00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:02.803
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that make us deviate from our True Path </v>

652
00:34:04.791 --> 00:34:09.080
<v Speaker 1>and our true path should be something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like imagine the noblest aim,</v>

653
00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:10.123
<v Speaker 1>then you can conceptualize and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice your life to attempting to </v>

654
00:34:13.521 --> 00:34:14.354
<v Speaker 1>attain it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's nothing in that that isn't </v>

655
00:34:16.611 --> 00:34:17.660
<v Speaker 1>good for everyone.</v>

656
00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:21.230
<v Speaker 1>And so apart from the fact that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>requires a lot of responsibility,</v>

657
00:34:21.231 --> 00:34:23.690
<v Speaker 1>I just can't see why everyone wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>do that.</v>

658
00:34:23.691 --> 00:34:27.140
<v Speaker 1>And when I'm talking to young people and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was shaking my finger and saying,</v>

659
00:34:27.141 --> 00:34:29.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grow the hell up and get mature and take</v>

660
00:34:29.811 --> 00:34:34.790
<v Speaker 1>on some responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that because I'm an enemy</v>

661
00:34:34.791 --> 00:34:35.624
<v Speaker 1>of the person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying it because I'm the best </v>

662
00:34:37.641 --> 00:34:41.190
<v Speaker 1>friend of the part of them that would </v>
<v Speaker 1>really like to walk in the light and,</v>

663
00:34:41.430 --> 00:34:44.210
<v Speaker 1>and it's an invitation to walk in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>light and,</v>

664
00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:47.840
<v Speaker 1>and it would be remarkable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what we need to do as far as I'm</v>

665
00:34:47.841 --> 00:34:50.660
<v Speaker 1>concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only in the West but in the world at</v>

666
00:34:50.661 --> 00:34:51.494
<v Speaker 1>large,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe in the West first is we have </v>

667
00:34:52.761 --> 00:34:53.594
<v Speaker 1>to consciously decide that we're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do everything we can as individuals </v>

668
00:34:58.881 --> 00:34:59.714
<v Speaker 1>to walk in the light and to regard that </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a noble and heroic endeavor and to </v>

669
00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:06.230
<v Speaker 1>make that first and foremost in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>

670
00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:08.840
<v Speaker 1>And that's what we should be educating </v>
<v Speaker 1>young people to do.</v>

671
00:35:08.841 --> 00:35:09.674
<v Speaker 1>And they can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I have dozens of people writing </v>

672
00:35:11.841 --> 00:35:12.674
<v Speaker 1>to me and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and talking to me all the time who are </v>

673
00:35:14.331 --> 00:35:15.830
<v Speaker 1>saying the same thing they're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

674
00:35:15.831 --> 00:35:19.400
<v Speaker 1>I've really been trying to get my act </v>
<v Speaker 1>together over the last six months.</v>

675
00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:20.413
<v Speaker 1>I've been trying not to lie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is slightly different than trying </v>

676
00:35:23.241 --> 00:35:24.170
<v Speaker 1>to tell the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

677
00:35:24.171 --> 00:35:27.500
<v Speaker 1>It's a more humble goal to not lie </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can tell when you're lying,</v>

678
00:35:27.501 --> 00:35:29.720
<v Speaker 1>but you can't necessarily tell when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're telling the truth.</v>

679
00:35:30.110 --> 00:35:32.180
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been coming up with a plan and I've</v>

680
00:35:32.181 --> 00:35:34.880
<v Speaker 1>been trying to discipline myself and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been cleaning up my room,</v>

681
00:35:34.881 --> 00:35:35.714
<v Speaker 1>which is like a nice humble act that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that involves transforming chaos into </v>

682
00:35:39.061 --> 00:35:40.290
<v Speaker 1>order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they write and say,</v>

683
00:35:40.291 --> 00:35:41.124
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things are just working out way better </v>

684
00:35:42.151 --> 00:35:42.540
<v Speaker 1>for me.</v>

685
00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:43.620
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

686
00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:45.510
<v Speaker 1>do it man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just,</v>

687
00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:49.260
<v Speaker 1>you keep that up for 15 years and you'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>be unbeatable.</v>

688
00:35:49.261 --> 00:35:52.290
<v Speaker 1>And that's what we should be convincing </v>
<v Speaker 1>young people to be,</v>

689
00:35:52.291 --> 00:35:53.124
<v Speaker 1>is to be unbeatable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And not because that's what they should </v>

690
00:35:55.471 --> 00:35:56.304
<v Speaker 1>do or because they're bad if they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because there's nothing better you </v>

691
00:35:59.371 --> 00:36:00.204
<v Speaker 1>can possibly do with your limited and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're limited and suffering bound life </v>

692
00:36:05.611 --> 00:36:09.240
<v Speaker 1>than to aim high and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sacrifice yourself to the attainment</v>

693
00:36:09.241 --> 00:36:11.100
<v Speaker 1>of those goals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

694
00:36:11.101 --> 00:36:14.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being a highly creative woman,</v>

695
00:36:14.131 --> 00:36:17.370
<v Speaker 1>I find myself fearful that having kids </v>
<v Speaker 1>will be spiritual suicide,</v>

696
00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:18.413
<v Speaker 1>hindering my endeavors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I also don't want to have an </v>

697
00:36:20.131 --> 00:36:23.370
<v Speaker 1>unfulfilled life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I have a full life without kids?</v>

698
00:36:23.970 --> 00:36:24.631
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

699
00:36:24.631 --> 00:36:26.100
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suspect you can.</v>

700
00:36:26.101 --> 00:36:27.330
<v Speaker 1>Although it's risky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maddie,</v>

701
00:36:27.331 --> 00:36:30.300
<v Speaker 1>because it's really important for people</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have kids.</v>

702
00:36:30.301 --> 00:36:33.480
<v Speaker 1>Because the thing is is that you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>older than 40,</v>

703
00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:36.210
<v Speaker 1>and our culture is kind of dopey in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>regards.</v>

704
00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:39.960
<v Speaker 1>It's underdeveloped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We live as if we live as if we,</v>

705
00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:42.420
<v Speaker 1>we only exist when we're young and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>

706
00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:47.690
<v Speaker 1>It's like what are you going to do from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ages of say 45 to 90 or 95?</v>

707
00:36:47.731 --> 00:36:49.440
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need a family around you.</v>

708
00:36:49.441 --> 00:36:52.080
<v Speaker 1>You need to see your children grow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to have grandchildren.</v>

709
00:36:52.081 --> 00:36:52.914
<v Speaker 1>It's a major part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe the most important part of the </v>

710
00:36:55.231 --> 00:36:57.450
<v Speaker 1>last half of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

711
00:36:57.690 --> 00:36:58.523
<v Speaker 1>you said being a highly creative woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find myself fearful that having kids </v>

712
00:37:01.591 --> 00:37:03.030
<v Speaker 1>will be spiritual suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

713
00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:03.893
<v Speaker 1>that's the part of your question that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>would really address because I would </v>

714
00:37:05.971 --> 00:37:06.601
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

715
00:37:06.601 --> 00:37:09.660
<v Speaker 1>don't let them be spiritual suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

716
00:37:09.661 --> 00:37:10.494
<v Speaker 1>it may be that there's a certain amount </v>
<v Speaker 1>of time that you need to take away from </v>

717
00:37:14.401 --> 00:37:15.180
<v Speaker 1>the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

718
00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:17.010
<v Speaker 1>and this is the case for parents in </v>
<v Speaker 1>general,</v>

719
00:37:17.370 --> 00:37:19.440
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that you can pursue your own creative</v>

720
00:37:19.441 --> 00:37:19.950
<v Speaker 1>endeavors.</v>

721
00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:22.830
<v Speaker 1>It's children do not have to devour your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

722
00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:25.350
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you let them devour your life,</v>

723
00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:27.540
<v Speaker 1>then you'll hate them and you mistreat </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

724
00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:28.673
<v Speaker 1>And so what you want to do is to set </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself up so that you can have </v>

725
00:37:31.351 --> 00:37:34.290
<v Speaker 1>children and have a life and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>better for the children.</v>

726
00:37:34.291 --> 00:37:37.290
<v Speaker 1>And it's better for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like children can be taught,</v>

727
00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:40.710
<v Speaker 1>encouraged to spend a fair bit of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not when they're infants,</v>

728
00:37:40.711 --> 00:37:41.544
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to spend a fair bit of time amusing </v>

729
00:37:43.801 --> 00:37:44.634
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's especially the case if you </v>

730
00:37:46.081 --> 00:37:49.620
<v Speaker 1>have more than one child because they'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>mutually amuse one another.</v>

731
00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:52.860
<v Speaker 1>It's actually easier in some ways to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have more than one child.</v>

732
00:37:52.861 --> 00:37:55.470
<v Speaker 1>Because with one child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're constantly amusing the child.</v>

733
00:37:55.471 --> 00:37:58.380
<v Speaker 1>But with two or three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they're off in their little,</v>

734
00:37:58.440 --> 00:37:59.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>club.</v>

735
00:37:59.461 --> 00:38:02.670
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you can stop them from </v>
<v Speaker 1>developing sibling rivalry,</v>

736
00:38:02.671 --> 00:38:05.280
<v Speaker 1>that's too intense and they can monitor </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

737
00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:06.113
<v Speaker 1>So the trick is if you're a highly </v>
<v Speaker 1>creative woman is be disagreeable and </v>

738
00:38:09.281 --> 00:38:12.810
<v Speaker 1>now so that you can carve yourself out </v>
<v Speaker 1>your own space so that you don't come to</v>

739
00:38:12.811 --> 00:38:14.940
<v Speaker 1>resent your children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're afraid of that.</v>

740
00:38:14.941 --> 00:38:18.270
<v Speaker 1>You're afraid that it looks like you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>afraid that if you,</v>

741
00:38:18.690 --> 00:38:21.660
<v Speaker 1>if you give yourself to children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there'll be nothing left for you.</v>

742
00:38:21.661 --> 00:38:23.040
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

743
00:38:23.041 --> 00:38:25.620
<v Speaker 1>that could happen if you have children </v>
<v Speaker 1>who have terrible health problems,</v>

744
00:38:25.621 --> 00:38:26.454
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't protect yourself against </v>

745
00:38:27.571 --> 00:38:32.310
<v Speaker 1>those eventualities in life anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I would say your best bet is to be a</v>

746
00:38:32.311 --> 00:38:34.320
<v Speaker 1>more selfish mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And believe me,</v>

747
00:38:34.321 --> 00:38:36.040
<v Speaker 1>I've had more clients</v>

748
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:39.280
<v Speaker 4>who were ruined by mothers who were too </v>
<v Speaker 4>unselfish than I've had clients who were</v>

749
00:38:39.281 --> 00:38:40.114
<v Speaker 4>ruined by mothers who were too selfish.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you need to be there when the kids </v>

750
00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:46.810
<v Speaker 4>need you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you shouldn't be there any more than</v>

751
00:38:46.811 --> 00:38:48.700
<v Speaker 4>is necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

752
00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:51.153
<v Speaker 4>let's see,</v>

753
00:39:00.070 --> 00:39:00.903
<v Speaker 4>Adam Watson,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feared having kids for the same </v>

754
00:39:02.201 --> 00:39:04.000
<v Speaker 4>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a full time pro artist.</v>

755
00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:08.350
<v Speaker 4>You make your own normal said my </v>
<v Speaker 4>therapist jp is speaking the truth.</v>

756
00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:09.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well that's the,</v>

757
00:39:10.210 --> 00:39:12.880
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the thing.</v>

758
00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:14.073
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't be thinking that you can't </v>

759
00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:18.730
<v Speaker 4>organize your life when you have </v>
<v Speaker 4>children.</v>

760
00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:22.000
<v Speaker 4>The thing about modern people is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're terrified of children,</v>

761
00:39:22.330 --> 00:39:23.163
<v Speaker 4>they and this because they think they </v>
<v Speaker 4>regard children as if they're miniature </v>

762
00:39:26.651 --> 00:39:28.720
<v Speaker 4>tyrants.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can be of course,</v>

763
00:39:28.721 --> 00:39:33.220
<v Speaker 4>because anyone will tyrannized over you </v>
<v Speaker 4>if you allow them to,</v>

764
00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:34.593
<v Speaker 4>perhaps not anyone but virtually anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why not regulate your children's </v>

765
00:39:37.751 --> 00:39:40.560
<v Speaker 4>behavior?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wrote a chapter in my new book called,</v>

766
00:39:40.561 --> 00:39:42.730
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't let your children do anything that</v>

767
00:39:42.731 --> 00:39:43.564
<v Speaker 4>makes you dislike them and that's like </v>
<v Speaker 4>really serious advice is like if you </v>

768
00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:48.273
<v Speaker 4>allow your children to conduct </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves around you in a manner that </v>

769
00:39:50.681 --> 00:39:52.840
<v Speaker 4>makes you dislike them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're being honest,</v>

770
00:39:52.841 --> 00:39:55.810
<v Speaker 4>if you're paying attention to the shadow</v>
<v Speaker 4>side of yourself,</v>

771
00:39:55.811 --> 00:39:56.644
<v Speaker 4>that can be aggressive and destructive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then then if you allow your children to </v>

772
00:40:01.841 --> 00:40:04.660
<v Speaker 4>do things that make you dislike them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then they're going to,</v>

773
00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:07.570
<v Speaker 4>they're having children is going to mess</v>
<v Speaker 4>up your life,</v>

774
00:40:07.571 --> 00:40:08.800
<v Speaker 4>but you don't have to do that.</v>

775
00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:12.280
<v Speaker 4>You're actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you actually have a tremendous amount of</v>

776
00:40:12.281 --> 00:40:16.390
<v Speaker 4>control over the quality of your </v>
<v Speaker 4>relationship with your children and also</v>

777
00:40:16.391 --> 00:40:19.210
<v Speaker 4>the manner in which you choose to </v>
<v Speaker 4>disperse your time.</v>

778
00:40:19.211 --> 00:40:20.980
<v Speaker 4>And I mean you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got,</v>

779
00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:26.590
<v Speaker 4>if you're willing to think it through </v>
<v Speaker 4>and be clear,</v>

780
00:40:27.370 --> 00:40:28.203
<v Speaker 4>you can be in charge of your household.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The children don't have to be in charge </v>

781
00:40:32.290 --> 00:40:34.180
<v Speaker 4>and it's not good for them to be in </v>
<v Speaker 4>charge anyways.</v>

782
00:40:34.181 --> 00:40:35.014
<v Speaker 4>So people are afraid of children and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's too bad because children are </v>

783
00:40:38.411 --> 00:40:39.790
<v Speaker 4>absolutely wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

784
00:40:39.791 --> 00:40:40.624
<v Speaker 4>you have to be careful with them and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they get tired and they get hungry and </v>

785
00:40:43.571 --> 00:40:46.630
<v Speaker 4>they get hot and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they don't have an attention span.</v>

786
00:40:46.631 --> 00:40:49.990
<v Speaker 4>That's as long as an adult who has a </v>
<v Speaker 4>long attention span,</v>

787
00:40:50.350 --> 00:40:55.090
<v Speaker 4>but they're great company and they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>unbelievably comical and they love you.</v>

788
00:40:55.091 --> 00:40:55.924
<v Speaker 4>And like they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they give back far more than they take </v>

789
00:40:58.391 --> 00:41:00.670
<v Speaker 4>if you have an ounce of sense when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're dealing with them.</v>

790
00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:02.380
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

791
00:41:02.590 --> 00:41:05.170
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so don't be afraid of children,</v>

792
00:41:05.350 --> 00:41:07.030
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're,</v>

793
00:41:07.031 --> 00:41:10.080
<v Speaker 4>you're the adult for God's sake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got the upper hand and,</v>

794
00:41:10.110 --> 00:41:12.640
<v Speaker 4>and if you have a partner,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can rely on Walden.</v>

795
00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:13.893
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can both decide how it is that </v>

796
00:41:15.671 --> 00:41:18.250
<v Speaker 4>you're going to run your household so </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you're actually thrilled to death,</v>

797
00:41:18.251 --> 00:41:20.020
<v Speaker 4>that you have kids in that you have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

798
00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:22.960
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

799
00:41:23.050 --> 00:41:23.883
<v Speaker 4>let's see.</v>

800
00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:40.270
<v Speaker 4>When am I appearing on each three h </v>
<v Speaker 4>three November,</v>

801
00:41:40.450 --> 00:41:41.860
<v Speaker 4>I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>November 3rd.</v>

802
00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:43.900
<v Speaker 4>So I'm looking forward to that.</v>

803
00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:45.673
<v Speaker 2>MMM.</v>

804
00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:50.103
<v Speaker 4>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you help someone with borderline </v>

805
00:41:53.501 --> 00:41:55.750
<v Speaker 4>personality disorder?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's Matthew Dodson.</v>

806
00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:03.361
<v Speaker 4>Matthew,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

807
00:42:03.361 --> 00:42:04.194
<v Speaker 4>I'd like to answer that question,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's so damn complicated that I </v>

808
00:42:06.091 --> 00:42:08.060
<v Speaker 4>don't think I can manage it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

809
00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:09.233
<v Speaker 4>so instead of doing a bad job,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even though that's a very interesting </v>

810
00:42:11.911 --> 00:42:14.070
<v Speaker 4>question,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm afraid I'm going to skip that.</v>

811
00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:15.523
<v Speaker 2>MMM.</v>

812
00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:20.140
<v Speaker 4>Let's look back at the pigeonhole panel </v>
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>

813
00:42:20.490 --> 00:42:21.323
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

814
00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:26.453
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

815
00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:28.850
<v Speaker 4>Do you consider this,</v>

816
00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:35.133
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

817
00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:42.510
<v Speaker 4>some people have criticized my portrayal</v>
<v Speaker 4>of postmodernism.</v>

818
00:42:42.930 --> 00:42:46.710
<v Speaker 4>In what ways would you claim you are a </v>
<v Speaker 4>fair or unfair in your assessment of its</v>

819
00:42:46.711 --> 00:42:47.640
<v Speaker 4>core principles?</v>

820
00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:49.370
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

821
00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:56.400
<v Speaker 4>I've done my best to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to give it an evenhanded assessment.</v>

822
00:42:56.910 --> 00:42:57.743
<v Speaker 2>MMM.</v>

823
00:42:58.150 --> 00:42:58.983
<v Speaker 4>And</v>

824
00:43:01.890 --> 00:43:02.723
<v Speaker 4>I think I'm unfair in that any rather </v>
<v Speaker 4>truncated criticism of a large body of </v>

825
00:43:09.361 --> 00:43:10.194
<v Speaker 4>thought is liable to clip a few corners.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I would say that I'm attempting to </v>

826
00:43:16.861 --> 00:43:21.120
<v Speaker 4>provide a snapshot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a relatively accurate but low resolution</v>

827
00:43:21.121 --> 00:43:26.121
<v Speaker 4>snapshot of a certain kind of war id on </v>
<v Speaker 4>a war of ideas that's currently going on</v>

828
00:43:26.221 --> 00:43:27.054
<v Speaker 4>in our culture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's primarily centered in the </v>

829
00:43:28.441 --> 00:43:29.274
<v Speaker 4>universities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I don't think my assessment of </v>

830
00:43:30.781 --> 00:43:34.560
<v Speaker 4>postmodernism and its relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 4>neo Marxism is unfair in the least.</v>

831
00:43:34.561 --> 00:43:37.920
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that the danger that's presented</v>

832
00:43:37.921 --> 00:43:38.754
<v Speaker 4>by that combination of ideological,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of ideological presumptions is more </v>

833
00:43:45.091 --> 00:43:47.460
<v Speaker 4>dangerous than people are currently </v>
<v Speaker 4>aware of.</v>

834
00:43:47.461 --> 00:43:48.294
<v Speaker 4>And that poses a larger threat to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>integrity of our culture then then I've </v>

835
00:43:53.790 --> 00:43:56.430
<v Speaker 4>currently stated it's more widespread </v>
<v Speaker 4>than I thought.</v>

836
00:43:56.431 --> 00:43:58.080
<v Speaker 4>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I first started,</v>

837
00:43:58.550 --> 00:43:59.383
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>speaking out against postmodernism and </v>

838
00:44:02.671 --> 00:44:04.710
<v Speaker 4>neo Marxism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't realize,</v>

839
00:44:04.711 --> 00:44:07.110
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the law schools had turned into,</v>

840
00:44:07.570 --> 00:44:10.650
<v Speaker 4>it had turned into training grounds for </v>
<v Speaker 4>social justice activists.</v>

841
00:44:10.650 --> 00:44:11.483
<v Speaker 4>I didn't realize that the legal system,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the legal training system had become </v>

842
00:44:14.610 --> 00:44:15.443
<v Speaker 4>corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>perhaps not to the same degrees as say </v>

843
00:44:17.401 --> 00:44:19.290
<v Speaker 4>the faculties of education or social </v>
<v Speaker 4>work.</v>

844
00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:20.393
<v Speaker 4>Certainly a long ways down that road.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I think I do believe that </v>

845
00:44:25.051 --> 00:44:28.620
<v Speaker 4>postmodernism is an intellectually </v>
<v Speaker 4>bankrupt school of thought.</v>

846
00:44:28.621 --> 00:44:33.270
<v Speaker 4>And I believe that its alliance with neo</v>
<v Speaker 4>Marxism borders on malevolent and it may</v>

847
00:44:33.271 --> 00:44:34.104
<v Speaker 4>even go past the border into actual </v>
<v Speaker 4>malevolence because I don't understand </v>

848
00:44:37.921 --> 00:44:38.754
<v Speaker 4>how anybody with an inkling of </v>
<v Speaker 4>historical sense can take a look at the </v>

849
00:44:41.401 --> 00:44:44.100
<v Speaker 4>20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then dare put forward ideas that are</v>

850
00:44:44.101 --> 00:44:47.070
<v Speaker 4>derived from Marxism as a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a,</v>

851
00:44:47.250 --> 00:44:52.250
<v Speaker 4>as a treatment for any of society's </v>
<v Speaker 4>hypothetical disorders.</v>

852
00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:53.453
<v Speaker 4>And it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not to say that I don't leave that </v>

853
00:44:54.721 --> 00:44:58.210
<v Speaker 4>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that there are errors in,</v>

854
00:44:58.360 --> 00:45:00.000
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in western culture,</v>

855
00:45:00.001 --> 00:45:02.160
<v Speaker 4>say for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for whatever that's worth.</v>

856
00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:03.023
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>individuals make more errors all the </v>

857
00:45:04.741 --> 00:45:08.430
<v Speaker 4>time in groups make moral errors and </v>
<v Speaker 4>cultures make moral errors.</v>

858
00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:09.863
<v Speaker 4>That isn't the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The issue is how are we doing compared </v>

859
00:45:14.071 --> 00:45:16.710
<v Speaker 4>to any reasonable alternatives.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

860
00:45:17.550 --> 00:45:18.383
<v Speaker 4>what makes you think that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's appropriate to compare the </v>

861
00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:24.390
<v Speaker 4>performance of western societies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

862
00:45:24.391 --> 00:45:27.540
<v Speaker 4>to some hypothetical utopia of your own </v>
<v Speaker 4>fictional imagining,</v>

863
00:45:27.541 --> 00:45:31.290
<v Speaker 4>especially when we seen what sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>utopias have emerged out of,</v>

864
00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:32.371
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>out of,</v>

865
00:45:32.371 --> 00:45:34.440
<v Speaker 4>out of such imaginings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

866
00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:35.393
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is it that you are offering people </v>

867
00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:38.573
<v Speaker 4>as a concrete alternative than all I see</v>
<v Speaker 4>in postmodernism is destruction and </v>

868
00:45:42.001 --> 00:45:45.420
<v Speaker 4>nihilism and always see in neo Marxism </v>
<v Speaker 4>is historical ignorance,</v>

869
00:45:45.421 --> 00:45:49.320
<v Speaker 4>malevolence and misdiagnosis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

870
00:45:49.321 --> 00:45:51.540
<v Speaker 4>and in gratitude and arrogance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

871
00:45:51.690 --> 00:45:56.040
<v Speaker 4>the list goes on and on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I don't feel that I've misrepresented</v>

872
00:45:56.041 --> 00:45:56.874
<v Speaker 4>the postmodernists in the least.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I find I regard like I've read a </v>

873
00:45:59.821 --> 00:46:00.654
<v Speaker 4>fair bit of Foodco less of Derrida but </v>
<v Speaker 4>enough to get a pretty good sense of </v>

874
00:46:03.421 --> 00:46:04.290
<v Speaker 4>what he's on about.</v>

875
00:46:04.650 --> 00:46:08.850
<v Speaker 4>Like foucault is readable but more or </v>
<v Speaker 4>less obvious as far as I'm concerned.</v>

876
00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:13.350
<v Speaker 4>And so he's a third rate thinker and </v>
<v Speaker 4>Derrida is just a troublemaker as far as</v>

877
00:46:13.351 --> 00:46:14.970
<v Speaker 4>I'm concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Although a very brilliant one.</v>

878
00:46:14.971 --> 00:46:15.804
<v Speaker 4>And the idea that the postmodernist had </v>
<v Speaker 4>that there's an infinite number of ways </v>

879
00:46:19.081 --> 00:46:23.280
<v Speaker 4>of interpreting any set of data,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say that's how actually happens to</v>

880
00:46:23.281 --> 00:46:26.700
<v Speaker 4>be a true observation and a very </v>
<v Speaker 4>problematic one,</v>

881
00:46:26.701 --> 00:46:29.040
<v Speaker 4>which is partly why it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so difficult,</v>

882
00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:31.230
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to evolve a system that can,</v>

883
00:46:31.770 --> 00:46:32.603
<v Speaker 4>that can visually perceive the world and</v>
<v Speaker 4>why about half our brain is devoted </v>

884
00:46:35.251 --> 00:46:36.330
<v Speaker 4>towards that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

885
00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:37.193
<v Speaker 4>it's definitely the case that coming up </v>
<v Speaker 4>with a viable interpretation of the </v>

886
00:46:40.381 --> 00:46:42.420
<v Speaker 4>world is a very difficult process.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

887
00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:46.590
<v Speaker 4>but that's about as far as the validity </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the postmodernist claims go.</v>

888
00:46:46.591 --> 00:46:47.580
<v Speaker 4>After that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

889
00:46:47.581 --> 00:46:48.870
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

890
00:46:48.871 --> 00:46:51.780
<v Speaker 4>there's a very large number of potential</v>
<v Speaker 4>interpretations of the world,</v>

891
00:46:51.781 --> 00:46:52.614
<v Speaker 4>but there's a very small number have </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually viable interpretations and </v>

892
00:46:55.171 --> 00:46:56.400
<v Speaker 4>that's really what's relevant.</v>

893
00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:59.310
<v Speaker 4>And viability is constrained by all </v>
<v Speaker 4>sorts of,</v>

894
00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:00.533
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

895
00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:02.490
<v Speaker 4>what would you call them?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

896
00:47:02.491 --> 00:47:04.440
<v Speaker 4>let's call them constraints.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

897
00:47:04.890 --> 00:47:06.660
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

898
00:47:06.661 --> 00:47:07.494
<v Speaker 4>you have to interpret the world in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>manner that's commensurate with the </v>

899
00:47:11.761 --> 00:47:12.594
<v Speaker 4>minimization of your own intolerable </v>
<v Speaker 4>suffering that puts very tight </v>

900
00:47:16.651 --> 00:47:20.280
<v Speaker 4>constraints on which interpretations </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're allowed to bring forward.</v>

901
00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:24.330
<v Speaker 4>You have to do that in a manner that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>iterable and repeatable across time.</v>

902
00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:29.660
<v Speaker 4>You have to do that in a way that isn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>too objectionable other people,</v>

903
00:47:29.681 --> 00:47:30.514
<v Speaker 4>or even better in a manner that makes </v>
<v Speaker 4>them want to cooperate and compete with </v>

904
00:47:33.851 --> 00:47:35.170
<v Speaker 4>you so that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

905
00:47:35.171 --> 00:47:36.004
<v Speaker 4>a rising tide lifts all boats.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's immense constraints on </v>

906
00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:45.360
<v Speaker 4>organizing your perceptions in a manner </v>
<v Speaker 4>that is similar [inaudible] individually</v>

907
00:47:45.911 --> 00:47:46.744
<v Speaker 4>and socially highly functional.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the postmodernist Joseph just don't </v>

908
00:47:49.811 --> 00:47:51.990
<v Speaker 4>grapple without at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They and,</v>

909
00:47:52.050 --> 00:47:52.883
<v Speaker 4>and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're biologically ignorant beyond </v>

910
00:47:55.001 --> 00:47:56.880
<v Speaker 4>belief and proud of that fact.</v>

911
00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:58.750
<v Speaker 4>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as you can tell,</v>

912
00:47:59.020 --> 00:47:59.853
<v Speaker 4>I can hardly say enough things that </v>
<v Speaker 4>aren't good about postmodern neo </v>

913
00:48:03.191 --> 00:48:04.300
<v Speaker 4>Marxists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

914
00:48:04.330 --> 00:48:05.163
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>apart from the fact that they got the </v>

915
00:48:06.431 --> 00:48:08.710
<v Speaker 4>initial observation right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is that there's a very,</v>

916
00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:09.633
<v Speaker 4>there's almost an infinite number of </v>
<v Speaker 4>ways of interpreting a finite set of </v>

917
00:48:11.981 --> 00:48:14.740
<v Speaker 4>data.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything else they've done is not only</v>

918
00:48:14.741 --> 00:48:15.574
<v Speaker 4>intellectually bankrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's also morally reprehensible and I </v>

919
00:48:18.101 --> 00:48:21.190
<v Speaker 4>think they're corrupting our culture and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they're,</v>

920
00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:24.430
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're hurting young people and they're</v>

921
00:48:24.431 --> 00:48:28.210
<v Speaker 4>hurting them as well by getting them to </v>
<v Speaker 4>pay for being hurt,</v>

922
00:48:28.211 --> 00:48:31.310
<v Speaker 4>which is really quite a malevolent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

923
00:48:31.850 --> 00:48:33.280
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>enterprise.</v>

924
00:48:33.370 --> 00:48:36.760
<v Speaker 4>So I've got no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what would you call,</v>

925
00:48:37.090 --> 00:48:37.923
<v Speaker 4>I have absolutely no regrets about going</v>
<v Speaker 4>after the postmodern neo Marxists as </v>

926
00:48:43.691 --> 00:48:47.230
<v Speaker 4>hard as I possibly can and I'm certainly</v>
<v Speaker 4>not done doing so.</v>

927
00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:48.970
<v Speaker 4>So one of the things that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>happen,</v>

928
00:48:48.971 --> 00:48:50.770
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the next month or so,</v>

929
00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:53.140
<v Speaker 4>I've been working with a programmer </v>
<v Speaker 4>who's,</v>

930
00:48:53.170 --> 00:48:56.290
<v Speaker 4>who's volunteered his services and has </v>
<v Speaker 4>already produced this.</v>

931
00:48:56.290 --> 00:48:57.123
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's produced a website that enables </v>

932
00:48:58.901 --> 00:48:59.734
<v Speaker 4>people to enter text that will then </v>
<v Speaker 4>classify the text as postmodern or non </v>

933
00:49:03.911 --> 00:49:04.744
<v Speaker 4>postmodern.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so you'll be able to enter course </v>

934
00:49:06.371 --> 00:49:09.550
<v Speaker 4>descriptions from universities,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the course description,</v>

935
00:49:09.551 --> 00:49:11.080
<v Speaker 4>the professor's name,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the discipline,</v>

936
00:49:11.081 --> 00:49:14.260
<v Speaker 4>and the university.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It will tell you the degree to which the</v>

937
00:49:14.261 --> 00:49:17.500
<v Speaker 4>description is postmodern and then you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can decide for yourself whether you want</v>

938
00:49:17.501 --> 00:49:19.780
<v Speaker 4>to take that it become a social justice </v>
<v Speaker 4>warrior.</v>

939
00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:20.653
<v Speaker 4>That's what you think your education </v>
<v Speaker 4>should be about or if you should avoid </v>

940
00:49:23.231 --> 00:49:25.150
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the plague that it truly is.</v>

941
00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:27.820
<v Speaker 4>And so my goal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I had to set a personal goal,</v>

942
00:49:27.821 --> 00:49:28.654
<v Speaker 4>and this is the sort of thing maybe that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you guys are helping me do with my </v>

943
00:49:31.151 --> 00:49:31.984
<v Speaker 4>continued support on Patrion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that I'd like to knock enrollment in </v>

944
00:49:34.871 --> 00:49:38.920
<v Speaker 4>the postmodern disciplines down by 75% </v>
<v Speaker 4>over the next five years.</v>

945
00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:40.173
<v Speaker 4>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I'm thinking about it from the </v>

946
00:49:42.731 --> 00:49:45.880
<v Speaker 4>perspective of of nonviolent warfare.</v>

947
00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:46.713
<v Speaker 4>It's that serious to me and that this </v>
<v Speaker 4>would be equivalent to cutting off the </v>

948
00:49:49.901 --> 00:49:51.790
<v Speaker 4>supply chain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like the,</v>

949
00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:52.673
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the postmodernists need a continual </v>

950
00:49:54.971 --> 00:49:55.804
<v Speaker 4>influx of young impressionable minds in </v>
<v Speaker 4>order to continue their propagandistic </v>

951
00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:01.113
<v Speaker 4>and society devouring efforts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm going to do absolutely </v>

952
00:50:03.791 --> 00:50:07.210
<v Speaker 4>everything I can to cut that supply </v>
<v Speaker 4>chain off at the source hopefully,</v>

953
00:50:07.211 --> 00:50:08.044
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and reduce their enrollment to the zero </v>

954
00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:13.600
<v Speaker 4>that would match their citation rate for</v>
<v Speaker 4>their publications.</v>

955
00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:15.033
<v Speaker 4>So would I in my career as an academic </v>
<v Speaker 4>in order to enter politics as a </v>

956
00:50:19.151 --> 00:50:21.790
<v Speaker 4>candidate for MP under Andrew Scheer's </v>
<v Speaker 4>leadership?</v>

957
00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:25.270
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no I don't think I would do that.</v>

958
00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:26.133
<v Speaker 4>I mean I thought for Awhile I thought at</v>
<v Speaker 4>one point of running for the leadership </v>

959
00:50:29.961 --> 00:50:30.794
<v Speaker 4>of the Liberal Party in Canada and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought at another point in running </v>

960
00:50:33.531 --> 00:50:35.510
<v Speaker 4>for the leadership of the Conservative </v>
<v Speaker 4>Party,</v>

961
00:50:36.170 --> 00:50:41.170
<v Speaker 4>but both times I decided that what I was</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing as a academic,</v>

962
00:50:43.970 --> 00:50:46.970
<v Speaker 4>and I would say as someone who's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>phyllis philosophy,</v>

963
00:50:48.110 --> 00:50:51.830
<v Speaker 4>a philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a philosophy and science cheeses,</v>

964
00:50:52.190 --> 00:50:53.023
<v Speaker 4>it's been a long day guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm starting to forget how to talk as a </v>

965
00:50:56.151 --> 00:51:01.151
<v Speaker 4>philosophically and scientifically </v>
<v Speaker 4>minded psychologist was more useful than</v>

966
00:51:02.601 --> 00:51:06.170
<v Speaker 4>anything I could likely do practically </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the political realm.</v>

967
00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:07.033
<v Speaker 4>And I haven't seen any reason to change </v>
<v Speaker 4>that opinion as a consequence of the </v>

968
00:51:11.541 --> 00:51:12.374
<v Speaker 4>events of the last eight months or so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so although I've always been </v>

969
00:51:15.471 --> 00:51:16.304
<v Speaker 4>interested in</v>

970
00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:17.750
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

971
00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:18.583
<v Speaker 4>politics as a potential career route,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every time the opportunity has arisen </v>

972
00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:23.983
<v Speaker 4>and I've had to make a choice between </v>
<v Speaker 4>continuing what I've been doing and </v>

973
00:51:27.471 --> 00:51:28.304
<v Speaker 4>pursuing a political pathway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've always decided to continue doing </v>

974
00:51:31.941 --> 00:51:32.774
<v Speaker 4>what I am doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's probably what I will </v>

975
00:51:35.031 --> 00:51:35.864
<v Speaker 4>continue to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I actually think I can have more </v>

976
00:51:37.941 --> 00:51:41.990
<v Speaker 4>influence doing what I'm doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I could by doing anything else.</v>

977
00:51:41.991 --> 00:51:42.824
<v Speaker 4>And that's partly because I suppose if I</v>
<v Speaker 4>thought there was anything else I could </v>

978
00:51:45.711 --> 00:51:48.050
<v Speaker 4>be doing that was more useful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd be doing that instead.</v>

979
00:51:48.620 --> 00:51:50.720
<v Speaker 4>So that's the answer to that.</v>

980
00:51:51.550 --> 00:51:52.383
<v Speaker 2>MMM.</v>

981
00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:55.873
<v Speaker 4>What is the role of art in a healthy </v>
<v Speaker 4>culture is postmodernism as destructive </v>

982
00:51:59.671 --> 00:52:02.330
<v Speaker 4>and in this domain as in politics?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

983
00:52:02.331 --> 00:52:03.051
<v Speaker 4>let,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's,</v>

984
00:52:03.051 --> 00:52:04.370
<v Speaker 4>that's Michael Bamford.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

985
00:52:04.371 --> 00:52:06.290
<v Speaker 4>what's the role of art in a healthy </v>
<v Speaker 4>culture?</v>

986
00:52:06.590 --> 00:52:07.423
<v Speaker 4>While the artists articulate the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the artists are the people who first </v>

987
00:52:09.861 --> 00:52:10.694
<v Speaker 4>articulate the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the role of artists in a healthy </v>

988
00:52:14.181 --> 00:52:15.014
<v Speaker 4>culture is to bring to public awareness </v>
<v Speaker 4>elements of being that have not yet </v>

989
00:52:20.031 --> 00:52:22.790
<v Speaker 4>entered the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the collective consciousness.</v>

990
00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:23.713
<v Speaker 4>So you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>imagine that we're all living on an </v>

991
00:52:27.471 --> 00:52:28.304
<v Speaker 4>island and many of us are in the center </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the island far enough away so that </v>

992
00:52:31.911 --> 00:52:34.760
<v Speaker 4>maybe we can't even see the shoreline </v>
<v Speaker 4>and we can't see the ocean.</v>

993
00:52:34.770 --> 00:52:37.460
<v Speaker 4>That's where our borders and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we're,</v>

994
00:52:37.461 --> 00:52:41.390
<v Speaker 4>we're distant from the artists are right</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the edge and they're,</v>

995
00:52:41.690 --> 00:52:42.800
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

996
00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:46.310
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're expanding the landscape.</v>

997
00:52:46.340 --> 00:52:49.010
<v Speaker 4>They're there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're moving the culture forward.</v>

998
00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:49.873
<v Speaker 4>That's where my metaphor fails.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess they're moving the culture </v>

999
00:52:52.971 --> 00:52:56.630
<v Speaker 4>forward into the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they do that by translating what is,</v>

1000
00:52:56.631 --> 00:52:57.464
<v Speaker 4>as of yet unimaginable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but sensed into what is at least </v>

1001
00:53:01.490 --> 00:53:05.740
<v Speaker 4>imaginable and represented,</v>
<v Speaker 4>represented in image and,</v>

1002
00:53:05.870 --> 00:53:06.703
<v Speaker 4>and drama and literature.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's the precursor to its full </v>

1003
00:53:09.441 --> 00:53:12.650
<v Speaker 4>formulation in articulated philosophy </v>
<v Speaker 4>and thought.</v>

1004
00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:15.140
<v Speaker 4>And that's what artists do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're problem solvers.</v>

1005
00:53:15.141 --> 00:53:17.360
<v Speaker 4>They're problem detectors and problem </v>
<v Speaker 4>solvers.</v>

1006
00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:18.583
<v Speaker 4>That's what true artists do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they're always trying to solve </v>

1007
00:53:20.511 --> 00:53:21.344
<v Speaker 4>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you,</v>

1008
00:53:21.590 --> 00:53:23.930
<v Speaker 4>there's a great documentary that was </v>
<v Speaker 4>made about Picasso,</v>

1009
00:53:23.931 --> 00:53:25.440
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a painting.</v>

1010
00:53:25.490 --> 00:53:27.330
<v Speaker 4>And unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember the name of it.</v>

1011
00:53:27.331 --> 00:53:28.164
<v Speaker 4>I think it was made in 1957 it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>available on youtube and it's in black </v>

1012
00:53:31.021 --> 00:53:36.021
<v Speaker 4>and white and Picasso is filmed making a</v>
<v Speaker 4>painting on a,</v>

1013
00:53:36.450 --> 00:53:37.283
<v Speaker 4>on a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on a window so that you can see exactly </v>

1014
00:53:38.641 --> 00:53:40.980
<v Speaker 4>what it's doing and you can watch them </v>
<v Speaker 4>work with ideas.</v>

1015
00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:44.010
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he paint something in and then he erases</v>

1016
00:53:44.011 --> 00:53:44.770
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1017
00:53:44.770 --> 00:53:45.603
<v Speaker 4>he paints over it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then he paints again and he paints over </v>

1018
00:53:47.311 --> 00:53:48.144
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He moves the figures around on the </v>

1019
00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:50.153
<v Speaker 4>canvas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1020
00:53:50.210 --> 00:53:54.210
<v Speaker 4>it's a window pane as I said.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you can see him working out visual,</v>

1021
00:53:54.510 --> 00:53:58.950
<v Speaker 4>you can see them working out problems </v>
<v Speaker 4>and solutions to problems using,</v>

1022
00:53:58.951 --> 00:54:02.850
<v Speaker 4>using his visual imagination and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>artistic product.</v>

1023
00:54:02.851 --> 00:54:03.684
<v Speaker 4>The painting is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is the consequence of that rather than </v>

1024
00:54:05.431 --> 00:54:08.970
<v Speaker 4>the aim of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The aim is to formulate the problems and</v>

1025
00:54:08.971 --> 00:54:11.160
<v Speaker 4>to work out the solutions and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>artistic</v>

1026
00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:13.980
<v Speaker 4>product.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The painting is,</v>

1027
00:54:13.981 --> 00:54:16.050
<v Speaker 4>is the byproduct of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not the aim.</v>

1028
00:54:16.650 --> 00:54:19.200
<v Speaker 4>And so artists move us forward into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>unknown.</v>

1029
00:54:19.201 --> 00:54:22.410
<v Speaker 4>And you can see them doing that in </v>
<v Speaker 4>cities because it's the open people,</v>

1030
00:54:22.411 --> 00:54:25.530
<v Speaker 4>the artists who go into parts of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>cities that are,</v>

1031
00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:26.753
<v Speaker 4>have degenerated to some degree back </v>
<v Speaker 4>into chaos and then revitalize them and </v>

1032
00:54:29.881 --> 00:54:30.750
<v Speaker 4>they civilize them.</v>

1033
00:54:30.750 --> 00:54:31.583
<v Speaker 4>And then the less artistic people who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who are more conventional move in and </v>

1034
00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:37.193
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's when you get gentrification and </v>

1035
00:54:38.131 --> 00:54:38.964
<v Speaker 4>that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that usually chases the artists out </v>

1036
00:54:40.441 --> 00:54:41.274
<v Speaker 4>and they go somewhere else cheap and </v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting and start the renewal </v>

1037
00:54:43.441 --> 00:54:46.410
<v Speaker 4>process again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the thing about artists,</v>

1038
00:54:46.590 --> 00:54:49.740
<v Speaker 4>and it's a hard thing to balance </v>
<v Speaker 4>property in our culture,</v>

1039
00:54:49.741 --> 00:54:52.920
<v Speaker 4>is that artists are unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 4>productive economically,</v>

1040
00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:54.113
<v Speaker 4>but it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very hard for them to monetize their </v>

1041
00:54:56.161 --> 00:54:56.994
<v Speaker 4>productivity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So even though what they produce can be </v>

1042
00:54:58.801 --> 00:55:00.730
<v Speaker 4>of incalculable value,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1043
00:55:01.050 --> 00:55:01.883
<v Speaker 4>it's very difficult for them to get any </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the economic value that they're </v>

1044
00:55:05.551 --> 00:55:09.350
<v Speaker 4>produced actually directed towards them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a major problem in,</v>

1045
00:55:09.460 --> 00:55:10.293
<v Speaker 4>and it's a major problem with trade </v>
<v Speaker 4>openness as a mode of being in the </v>

1046
00:55:12.781 --> 00:55:13.614
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's postmodernism is destructive in </v>

1047
00:55:17.191 --> 00:55:18.024
<v Speaker 4>this realm as it is in politics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Postmodernism is perhaps equally </v>

1048
00:55:21.571 --> 00:55:24.120
<v Speaker 4>destructive in all realms as far as I </v>
<v Speaker 4>can tell,</v>

1049
00:55:24.330 --> 00:55:25.390
<v Speaker 4>especially when it's allowed.</v>

1050
00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:27.540
<v Speaker 4>But with neo Marxism and those two </v>
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>

1051
00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:29.700
<v Speaker 4>there's no reason they should go hand in</v>
<v Speaker 4>hand.</v>

1052
00:55:29.701 --> 00:55:31.890
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because if you're a postmodernist,</v>

1053
00:55:32.190 --> 00:55:37.190
<v Speaker 4>there's absolutely no reason stemming </v>
<v Speaker 4>from your own philosophy that you should</v>

1054
00:55:37.231 --> 00:55:39.810
<v Speaker 4>ally yourself with a new Marxist </v>
<v Speaker 4>political outlook.</v>

1055
00:55:39.990 --> 00:55:40.823
<v Speaker 4>And the fact that those two things are </v>
<v Speaker 4>found together almost inevitably </v>

1056
00:55:44.550 --> 00:55:45.383
<v Speaker 4>indicates to me that postmodernism is </v>
<v Speaker 4>the handmaiden of the Neo Marxists </v>

1057
00:55:49.890 --> 00:55:52.920
<v Speaker 4>rather than the other way around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So in in fact,</v>

1058
00:55:52.921 --> 00:55:53.754
<v Speaker 4>postmodernism is the intellectual front </v>
<v Speaker 4>that the Neo Marxists where or adopt to </v>

1059
00:55:58.231 --> 00:56:01.290
<v Speaker 4>hide from themselves and other people </v>
<v Speaker 4>their true motivations,</v>

1060
00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:05.300
<v Speaker 4>which are mostly driven by revenge and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and resentment and,</v>

1061
00:56:05.430 --> 00:56:09.660
<v Speaker 4>and the desire to destroy and a hatred </v>
<v Speaker 4>for quality and a hatred for qualitative</v>

1062
00:56:09.661 --> 00:56:11.490
<v Speaker 4>distinctions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is dead.</v>

1063
00:56:11.550 --> 00:56:13.620
<v Speaker 4>It's death.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean with young people,</v>

1064
00:56:13.621 --> 00:56:15.090
<v Speaker 4>you want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1065
00:56:15.390 --> 00:56:16.223
<v Speaker 4>there's not much to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're only 20 and you're kind of </v>

1066
00:56:17.251 --> 00:56:18.084
<v Speaker 4>useless.</v>

1067
00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:20.150
<v Speaker 4>But that's because you're only 20 you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

1068
00:56:20.730 --> 00:56:22.470
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't mean you're not full of </v>
<v Speaker 4>potential.</v>

1069
00:56:22.471 --> 00:56:23.304
<v Speaker 4>That potential needs to manifest itself </v>
<v Speaker 4>so that you can turn into something </v>

1070
00:56:25.661 --> 00:56:27.100
<v Speaker 4>that's it's of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

1071
00:56:27.370 --> 00:56:29.950
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of world beating significance.</v>

1072
00:56:30.250 --> 00:56:33.850
<v Speaker 4>But in order to tell a young person that</v>
<v Speaker 4>credibly you have to say,</v>

1073
00:56:33.851 --> 00:56:34.684
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are true qualitative distinctions </v>

1074
00:56:35.711 --> 00:56:38.020
<v Speaker 4>between things and you're just getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>started.</v>

1075
00:56:38.021 --> 00:56:42.760
<v Speaker 4>There are highlights that you can ascend</v>
<v Speaker 4>to that are genuinely high,</v>

1076
00:56:43.060 --> 00:56:45.520
<v Speaker 4>which also means they're above where you</v>
<v Speaker 4>are now,</v>

1077
00:56:45.700 --> 00:56:48.550
<v Speaker 4>but that gives your life the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 4>there are those things to pursue,</v>

1078
00:56:48.551 --> 00:56:52.060
<v Speaker 4>gives your life deep meaning and </v>
<v Speaker 4>significance and gives your struggle.</v>

1079
00:56:52.360 --> 00:56:55.960
<v Speaker 4>Nobility and validity and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>postmodernist,</v>

1080
00:56:55.990 --> 00:56:56.823
<v Speaker 4>Neil Marxist as far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are absolute enemies of qualitative </v>

1081
00:56:59.381 --> 00:57:02.650
<v Speaker 4>distinctions and so what they do is </v>
<v Speaker 4>destroy everyone's ambition.</v>

1082
00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:06.010
<v Speaker 4>It's like we're all already as valuable </v>
<v Speaker 4>as we're going to get.</v>

1083
00:57:06.011 --> 00:57:06.641
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1084
00:57:06.641 --> 00:57:07.960
<v Speaker 4>well fine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's good.</v>

1085
00:57:07.961 --> 00:57:09.460
<v Speaker 4>We don't have to feel bad about </v>
<v Speaker 4>ourselves,</v>

1086
00:57:09.461 --> 00:57:10.294
<v Speaker 4>but what the hell are we going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are we going to orient ourselves </v>

1087
00:57:12.941 --> 00:57:16.210
<v Speaker 4>towards?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What we want is multiple hierarchies,</v>

1088
00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:19.660
<v Speaker 4>multiple steep hierarchies of competence</v>
<v Speaker 4>that are open in,</v>

1089
00:57:19.930 --> 00:57:20.763
<v Speaker 4>in fair competition to everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if we don't have enough hierarchies </v>

1090
00:57:24.521 --> 00:57:25.354
<v Speaker 4>of competence for everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you know it's up to the creative </v>

1091
00:57:27.581 --> 00:57:30.790
<v Speaker 4>people to produce some new ones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not like we'll necessarily run out.</v>

1092
00:57:31.450 --> 00:57:32.283
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

1093
00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:37.393
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

1094
00:57:38.710 --> 00:57:39.543
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever had to tell someone that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they are best suited to a subservient </v>

1095
00:57:42.550 --> 00:57:46.030
<v Speaker 4>slash blue collar lifestyle because they</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't have any semblance of brilliance?</v>

1096
00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:47.073
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well I want to take issue with the </v>

1097
00:57:48.011 --> 00:57:48.844
<v Speaker 4>formulation of that question,</v>
<v Speaker 4>although I think it's a perfectly </v>

1098
00:57:50.501 --> 00:57:52.930
<v Speaker 4>reasonable question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's Gen Swan.</v>

1099
00:57:53.380 --> 00:57:56.920
<v Speaker 4>Don't be thinking that a blue collar </v>
<v Speaker 4>lifestyle is necessarily subservient.</v>

1100
00:57:57.310 --> 00:57:58.150
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

1101
00:57:58.151 --> 00:57:58.984
<v Speaker 4>you can be a trades person and now it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>a really good career choice as far as </v>

1102
00:58:01.661 --> 00:58:03.070
<v Speaker 4>I'm concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very,</v>

1103
00:58:03.071 --> 00:58:04.450
<v Speaker 4>very valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1104
00:58:04.810 --> 00:58:05.643
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>good plumbers are rare and good </v>

1105
00:58:06.941 --> 00:58:10.870
<v Speaker 4>carpenters are rare and good bricklayers</v>
<v Speaker 4>are rare and they're so useful.</v>

1106
00:58:10.871 --> 00:58:12.460
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do a lot of renovation work.</v>

1107
00:58:12.461 --> 00:58:15.040
<v Speaker 4>I've done an awful lot of renovation </v>
<v Speaker 4>work on all the places that I've,</v>

1108
00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:15.993
<v Speaker 4>I've lived in and I've learned to do a </v>
<v Speaker 4>fair bit of construction and automotive </v>

1109
00:58:18.641 --> 00:58:20.230
<v Speaker 4>body work and all those sorts of things.</v>

1110
00:58:20.230 --> 00:58:22.510
<v Speaker 4>And I really liked doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

1111
00:58:22.630 --> 00:58:23.463
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're blue collar life is not </v>

1112
00:58:25.150 --> 00:58:25.983
<v Speaker 4>necessarily subservient at all because </v>
<v Speaker 4>you can be master of your trades domain </v>

1113
00:58:29.111 --> 00:58:29.944
<v Speaker 4>and be unbelievably economically useful </v>
<v Speaker 4>and productive and creative and </v>

1114
00:58:32.951 --> 00:58:35.610
<v Speaker 4>independent and autonomous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so there's,</v>

1115
00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:38.170
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing necessarily subservient </v>
<v Speaker 4>about that.</v>

1116
00:58:38.620 --> 00:58:39.910
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>

1117
00:58:39.940 --> 00:58:41.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're thinking more about,</v>

1118
00:58:41.500 --> 00:58:42.333
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say life at the low end of a </v>

1119
00:58:43.841 --> 00:58:45.130
<v Speaker 4>restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but even there,</v>

1120
00:58:45.131 --> 00:58:48.340
<v Speaker 4>if you're a conscientious person and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're careful and you,</v>

1121
00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:49.233
<v Speaker 4>and you're awake and you treat the </v>
<v Speaker 4>people around you well and you do your </v>

1122
00:58:52.601 --> 00:58:55.000
<v Speaker 4>job properly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's also room for advancement in the</v>

1123
00:58:55.001 --> 00:58:55.834
<v Speaker 4>private sphere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no reason to assume whatsoever </v>

1124
00:58:57.851 --> 00:58:58.684
<v Speaker 4>that merely because you don't have the </v>
<v Speaker 4>intellectual horsepower to work well in </v>

1125
00:59:03.611 --> 00:59:04.660
<v Speaker 4>the ABS,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the,</v>

1126
00:59:04.810 --> 00:59:09.640
<v Speaker 4>in the domain of rapidly shifting </v>
<v Speaker 4>abstractions that your life has to be of</v>

1127
00:59:09.641 --> 00:59:12.160
<v Speaker 4>secondary quality or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or,</v>

1128
00:59:12.220 --> 00:59:13.090
<v Speaker 4>or opportunity.</v>

1129
00:59:13.090 --> 00:59:14.440
<v Speaker 4>I don't see that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1130
00:59:14.590 --> 00:59:17.440
<v Speaker 4>and there is endless opportunity in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>trades and,</v>

1131
00:59:17.441 --> 00:59:19.420
<v Speaker 4>and like in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in Toronto for example,</v>

1132
00:59:19.421 --> 00:59:20.254
<v Speaker 4>there's a chronic shortage of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's always a shortage of </v>

1133
00:59:23.780 --> 00:59:27.500
<v Speaker 4>qualified people for every occupation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1134
00:59:27.501 --> 00:59:28.334
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I have to tell someone that they're </v>

1135
00:59:29.991 --> 00:59:33.680
<v Speaker 4>best suited to a blue collar lifestyle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't feel bad about it.</v>

1136
00:59:33.681 --> 00:59:34.550
<v Speaker 4>I might say to them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1137
00:59:34.551 --> 00:59:35.101
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1138
00:59:35.101 --> 00:59:35.934
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1139
00:59:36.060 --> 00:59:36.893
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's assume you're talking to someone </v>

1140
00:59:37.761 --> 00:59:38.594
<v Speaker 4>who has an Iq of a hundred,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is the Iq of the average high </v>

1141
00:59:40.641 --> 00:59:42.590
<v Speaker 4>school graduate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You might say,</v>

1142
00:59:42.591 --> 00:59:42.951
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1143
00:59:42.951 --> 00:59:44.240
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1144
00:59:44.750 --> 00:59:46.960
<v Speaker 4>less you're super conscientious,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1145
00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:49.280
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>career in something like law is probably</v>

1146
00:59:49.281 --> 00:59:52.490
<v Speaker 4>not your best bet because you're going </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be competing with people who have iqs</v>

1147
00:59:52.491 --> 00:59:54.440
<v Speaker 4>that are like 30 points higher than </v>
<v Speaker 4>yours,</v>

1148
00:59:54.441 --> 00:59:55.274
<v Speaker 4>or 25 points higher than yours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you really work yourself to </v>

1149
00:59:57.831 --> 00:59:58.664
<v Speaker 4>death,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you might be able to main maintain </v>

1150
00:59:59.871 --> 01:00:00.704
<v Speaker 4>competitiveness in that domain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're going to be working at a </v>

1151
01:00:02.481 --> 01:00:05.090
<v Speaker 4>powerful disadvantage because the people</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you're competing with,</v>

1152
01:00:05.091 --> 01:00:05.924
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are going to be way faster than you </v>

1153
01:00:07.101 --> 01:00:07.790
<v Speaker 4>verbally.</v>

1154
01:00:07.790 --> 01:00:11.120
<v Speaker 4>They're gonna be able to read faster and</v>
<v Speaker 4>to reason verbally faster,</v>

1155
01:00:11.121 --> 01:00:12.170
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and all of that.</v>

1156
01:00:12.171 --> 01:00:15.140
<v Speaker 4>And it might be better to pick up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1157
01:00:15.470 --> 01:00:16.570
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an ambition.</v>

1158
01:00:16.571 --> 01:00:17.404
<v Speaker 4>It's more in keeping with the quality of</v>
<v Speaker 4>your temperament and your intelligence </v>

1159
01:00:20.931 --> 01:00:23.060
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to put it bluntly so that you can be,</v>

1160
01:00:23.150 --> 01:00:25.460
<v Speaker 4>but that doesn't mean that your success </v>
<v Speaker 4>has to be limited.</v>

1161
01:00:25.910 --> 01:00:26.743
<v Speaker 4>And it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it also doesn't mean that I'm in ve </v>

1162
01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:28.813
<v Speaker 4>elevating intelligence to do a platform </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the ultimate moral ideal because the </v>

1163
01:00:33.441 --> 01:00:36.740
<v Speaker 4>relationship between intelligence and </v>
<v Speaker 4>moral ideal is zero.</v>

1164
01:00:36.770 --> 01:00:39.170
<v Speaker 4>There is no relationship between them at</v>
<v Speaker 4>all.</v>

1165
01:00:39.410 --> 01:00:40.370
<v Speaker 4>Intelligence is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1166
01:00:40.610 --> 01:00:41.443
<v Speaker 4>is our capacity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say that can be put to ill use </v>

1167
01:00:44.871 --> 01:00:48.200
<v Speaker 4>just as well as to good use.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's nothing intrinsically better</v>

1168
01:00:48.201 --> 01:00:49.034
<v Speaker 4>about smart people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They might be more useful for certain </v>

1169
01:00:51.201 --> 01:00:53.270
<v Speaker 4>things if they're oriented towards the </v>
<v Speaker 4>good,</v>

1170
01:00:53.630 --> 01:00:54.740
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1171
01:00:55.010 --> 01:00:55.843
<v Speaker 4>there's absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no shortage of opportunity in </v>

1172
01:00:58.491 --> 01:01:01.700
<v Speaker 4>the working class end of the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>

1173
01:01:01.701 --> 01:01:05.120
<v Speaker 4>And I can certainly understand often why</v>
<v Speaker 4>people might prefer that too.</v>

1174
01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:10.480
<v Speaker 4>To the endless,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my asthma,</v>

1175
01:01:10.860 --> 01:01:14.400
<v Speaker 4>you might say chaotic Miasma of complex </v>
<v Speaker 4>abstract jobs.</v>

1176
01:01:14.550 --> 01:01:17.490
<v Speaker 4>One of the problems with those sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 4>jobs is that you're never done.</v>

1177
01:01:18.030 --> 01:01:18.863
<v Speaker 4>It never finished.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's always more work than you can </v>

1178
01:01:20.401 --> 01:01:23.400
<v Speaker 4>possibly do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So all right,</v>

1179
01:01:23.401 --> 01:01:25.410
<v Speaker 4>so that's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's see here.</v>

1180
01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:27.313
<v Speaker 3>MMM.</v>

1181
01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:31.200
<v Speaker 4>I feel sensitive to meme culture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Slash irony.</v>

1182
01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:36.030
<v Speaker 4>It seems hard to act out honesty when </v>
<v Speaker 4>every facet of human behavior has turned</v>

1183
01:01:36.031 --> 01:01:36.864
<v Speaker 4>into a meme.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I worried people's natural reaction </v>

1184
01:01:38.821 --> 01:01:40.920
<v Speaker 4>will be to mock or scoff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1185
01:01:41.310 --> 01:01:43.830
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been the target of my fair share of</v>

1186
01:01:43.831 --> 01:01:44.664
<v Speaker 4>memes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1187
01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:48.120
<v Speaker 4>perhaps more than my fair share.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I actually find it extremely,</v>

1188
01:01:48.420 --> 01:01:51.450
<v Speaker 4>I'm really happy about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And part of the reason for that</v>

1189
01:01:53.190 --> 01:01:56.070
<v Speaker 4>involves some of the elements of our </v>
<v Speaker 4>earlier discussion.</v>

1190
01:01:56.071 --> 01:01:57.450
<v Speaker 4>People were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1191
01:01:57.451 --> 01:01:59.580
<v Speaker 4>how do you plan to keep your feet on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>ground,</v>

1192
01:01:59.610 --> 01:02:01.860
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>given your new phone public,</v>

1193
01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:03.380
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1194
01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:07.020
<v Speaker 4>pr profile.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I see the,</v>

1195
01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:10.770
<v Speaker 4>the meme culture as part of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>corrective.</v>

1196
01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:11.633
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a great role for satire and </v>

1197
01:02:13.621 --> 01:02:16.590
<v Speaker 4>irony and all of the elements of comedy </v>
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

1198
01:02:16.710 --> 01:02:19.530
<v Speaker 4>to act as a corrective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I mean,</v>

1199
01:02:19.531 --> 01:02:20.364
<v Speaker 4>I've been fortunate because most of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>memes that have been directed my way </v>

1200
01:02:22.921 --> 01:02:25.320
<v Speaker 4>have been done with good humor.</v>

1201
01:02:25.650 --> 01:02:26.483
<v Speaker 4>I'm lucky because for some reason the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ratio of positive attention I received </v>

1202
01:02:33.121 --> 01:02:35.820
<v Speaker 4>from the general public,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>

1203
01:02:36.330 --> 01:02:37.163
<v Speaker 4>is compared to the ratio to the amount </v>
<v Speaker 4>of negative reactions I'm receiving is </v>

1204
01:02:42.091 --> 01:02:42.924
<v Speaker 4>very disproportionate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I receiving almost all positive </v>

1205
01:02:44.611 --> 01:02:45.630
<v Speaker 4>reactions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1206
01:02:45.810 --> 01:02:46.643
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm in the fortunate position of being </v>

1207
01:02:47.431 --> 01:02:48.930
<v Speaker 4>able to allow for long with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

1208
01:02:49.430 --> 01:02:52.140
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that there's any reason to</v>

1209
01:02:52.141 --> 01:02:55.560
<v Speaker 4>assume that irony and satire have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>become cruel and scoffing.</v>

1210
01:02:56.310 --> 01:02:57.143
<v Speaker 4>They can be done with a light touch and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they can be done in a manner that keeps </v>

1211
01:03:00.601 --> 01:03:05.370
<v Speaker 4>everybody awake and make sure that no </v>
<v Speaker 4>one is above</v>

1212
01:03:06.670 --> 01:03:07.500
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1213
01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:09.240
<v Speaker 4>Both criticism and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1214
01:03:09.510 --> 01:03:10.343
<v Speaker 4>and humor that they're now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that sort of thing can become cynical </v>

1215
01:03:16.471 --> 01:03:17.304
<v Speaker 4>very rapidly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it degenerate as soon as it becomes </v>

1216
01:03:19.771 --> 01:03:21.930
<v Speaker 4>cynical.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see this with satirical shows,</v>

1217
01:03:21.931 --> 01:03:22.620
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1218
01:03:22.620 --> 01:03:25.620
<v Speaker 4>I really liked the simpsons,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the first 13 seasons in particular,</v>

1219
01:03:25.621 --> 01:03:28.530
<v Speaker 4>and like it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was one of the very rare,</v>

1220
01:03:28.531 --> 01:03:29.364
<v Speaker 4>true satires on American television.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it never degenerated into cynicism </v>

1221
01:03:32.970 --> 01:03:33.803
<v Speaker 4>in part because although it comedically </v>
<v Speaker 4>critiqued almost every element of </v>

1222
01:03:39.661 --> 01:03:41.700
<v Speaker 4>American life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was also,</v>

1223
01:03:41.790 --> 01:03:45.270
<v Speaker 4>it also had a set of messages that were </v>
<v Speaker 4>very positive.</v>

1224
01:03:45.271 --> 01:03:46.104
<v Speaker 4>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Simpson family was an </v>

1225
01:03:47.191 --> 01:03:48.024
<v Speaker 4>extraordinarily coherent nuclear family </v>
<v Speaker 4>unit and for whatever homer's faults </v>

1226
01:03:51.991 --> 01:03:53.490
<v Speaker 4>might've been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they were myriad,</v>

1227
01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:58.590
<v Speaker 4>he was always there as a reliable and </v>
<v Speaker 4>trustworthy a father to his family,</v>

1228
01:03:58.591 --> 01:04:00.360
<v Speaker 4>despite his,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1229
01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:03.630
<v Speaker 4>somewhat limited abilities,</v>
<v Speaker 4>both ethically and intellectually.</v>

1230
01:04:03.870 --> 01:04:04.703
<v Speaker 4>He was there when it counted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that stopped that show from </v>

1231
01:04:07.381 --> 01:04:10.230
<v Speaker 4>degenerating into cynicism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I also think the same boat,</v>

1232
01:04:10.231 --> 01:04:11.064
<v Speaker 4>the trailer park boys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a show that I have a fair bit </v>

1233
01:04:13.651 --> 01:04:15.210
<v Speaker 4>of partiality four,</v>
<v Speaker 4>despite its,</v>

1234
01:04:15.510 --> 01:04:18.660
<v Speaker 4>it's endless profanity and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and an absurdity,</v>

1235
01:04:19.170 --> 01:04:20.003
<v Speaker 4>it has the same underlying structure is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that the characters are bound together </v>

1236
01:04:24.031 --> 01:04:24.864
<v Speaker 4>by genuine affection.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's something about that that </v>

1237
01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:30.650
<v Speaker 4>that makes the satirical message,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1238
01:04:30.990 --> 01:04:33.960
<v Speaker 4>both positive and deeply acceptable as </v>
<v Speaker 4>far as I'm concerned.</v>

1239
01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:35.213
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

1240
01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:44.790
<v Speaker 4>I know lots of laughs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jordan watches trailer park boys.</v>

1241
01:04:44.791 --> 01:04:46.650
<v Speaker 4>I don't just watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really like it.</v>

1242
01:04:46.651 --> 01:04:49.230
<v Speaker 4>I really get a kick out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how many of you are trailer</v>

1243
01:04:49.231 --> 01:04:50.064
<v Speaker 4>Park Boys Aficionados?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably not that many because it is a </v>

1244
01:04:51.961 --> 01:04:53.910
<v Speaker 4>pretty rough schilt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>

1245
01:04:54.450 --> 01:04:56.700
<v Speaker 4>the conky episode,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's gotta be one of the,</v>

1246
01:04:57.170 --> 01:04:58.740
<v Speaker 4>the high,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's one of the highest.</v>

1247
01:04:58.950 --> 01:04:59.783
<v Speaker 4>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the highest reach of Canadian comedy as </v>

1248
01:05:01.651 --> 01:05:04.470
<v Speaker 4>far as I'm concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That episode just absolutely floored me.</v>

1249
01:05:04.471 --> 01:05:07.210
<v Speaker 4>It was so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was so surreal and so observed that,</v>

1250
01:05:07.830 --> 01:05:10.370
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>alright.</v>

1251
01:05:10.470 --> 01:05:11.460
<v Speaker 4>Let's see here.</v>

1252
01:05:22.180 --> 01:05:23.013
<v Speaker 4>What are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is your advice for someone who lives </v>

1253
01:05:24.491 --> 01:05:26.440
<v Speaker 4>with chronic pain?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow,</v>

1254
01:05:26.470 --> 01:05:27.303
<v Speaker 4>that's a tough one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How can I discipline myself mentally in </v>

1255
01:05:29.051 --> 01:05:31.570
<v Speaker 4>order to be productive when I feel awful</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of the time?</v>

1256
01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:34.390
<v Speaker 4>What coping methods cannot use?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

1257
01:05:34.391 --> 01:05:37.060
<v Speaker 4>the first thing I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a question posed by shivers,</v>

1258
01:05:37.061 --> 01:05:39.370
<v Speaker 4>is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're suffering chronic pain,</v>

1259
01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:42.970
<v Speaker 4>one of the things you can do is try not </v>
<v Speaker 4>to judge yourself too harshly.</v>

1260
01:05:42.971 --> 01:05:44.350
<v Speaker 4>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's really rough.</v>

1261
01:05:44.351 --> 01:05:45.184
<v Speaker 4>And why don't you start by assuming that</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're having a hard time </v>

1262
01:05:47.831 --> 01:05:48.664
<v Speaker 4>disciplining yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's actually a consequence of the </v>

1263
01:05:50.441 --> 01:05:53.200
<v Speaker 4>chronic pain rather than a moral fault.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1264
01:05:53.201 --> 01:05:54.034
<v Speaker 4>like I've dealt with lots of people </v>
<v Speaker 4>who've had terrible chronic health </v>

1265
01:05:56.111 --> 01:05:58.240
<v Speaker 4>problems and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1266
01:05:58.450 --> 01:05:59.170
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1267
01:05:59.170 --> 01:06:00.003
<v Speaker 4>you want to push yourself because you </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't want to end up in a situation </v>

1268
01:06:04.421 --> 01:06:05.254
<v Speaker 4>where the disease condition is taking </v>
<v Speaker 4>more away from you than it absolutely </v>

1269
01:06:10.331 --> 01:06:10.870
<v Speaker 4>has to.</v>

1270
01:06:10.870 --> 01:06:11.703
<v Speaker 4>So you attempt to impose minimal </v>
<v Speaker 4>disciplinary structures on yourself too </v>

1271
01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:17.770
<v Speaker 4>to push the illness back as much as you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can.</v>

1272
01:06:17.771 --> 01:06:20.260
<v Speaker 4>But if you're in chronic pain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say,</v>

1273
01:06:20.530 --> 01:06:21.363
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you need to find someone that you can </v>

1274
01:06:23.891 --> 01:06:26.440
<v Speaker 4>trust to talk to so that they can help </v>
<v Speaker 4>you plan.</v>

1275
01:06:27.070 --> 01:06:27.903
<v Speaker 4>And you need to be able to delineate out</v>
<v Speaker 4>what your limitations are in a manner </v>

1276
01:06:31.331 --> 01:06:32.164
<v Speaker 4>that they can understand so that you can</v>
<v Speaker 4>jointly focus on how to make productive </v>

1277
01:06:36.941 --> 01:06:37.774
<v Speaker 4>use and high quality use of the time </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you can actually spend outside of </v>

1278
01:06:41.741 --> 01:06:42.574
<v Speaker 4>merely suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The other thing that I would ask you </v>

1279
01:06:44.111 --> 01:06:44.944
<v Speaker 4>about is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are you sure that your medication </v>

1280
01:06:46.571 --> 01:06:51.190
<v Speaker 4>regimen regimen is adjusted optimally?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because antidepressants,</v>

1281
01:06:51.191 --> 01:06:52.024
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can be very effective long term </v>

1282
01:06:55.210 --> 01:06:57.460
<v Speaker 4>medication for chronic pain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially,</v>

1283
01:06:57.500 --> 01:06:59.460
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>drugs like Celexa w.</v>

1284
01:06:59.620 --> 01:07:00.453
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you use an </v>

1285
01:07:01.361 --> 01:07:03.910
<v Speaker 4>antidepressant in your attempts to </v>
<v Speaker 4>manage your chronic pain,</v>

1286
01:07:03.911 --> 01:07:05.890
<v Speaker 4>but that's something I would definitely </v>
<v Speaker 4>recommend.</v>

1287
01:07:05.890 --> 01:07:09.460
<v Speaker 4>And there was a lot of pharmaceutical </v>
<v Speaker 4>treatment and you know,</v>

1288
01:07:09.461 --> 01:07:10.294
<v Speaker 4>you may have run the gamut already.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know lots of people who have chronic </v>

1289
01:07:12.431 --> 01:07:13.510
<v Speaker 4>pain have done that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

1290
01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:17.200
<v Speaker 4>and also stimulants,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the adhd medications,</v>

1291
01:07:17.230 --> 01:07:19.540
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can also be helpful in the management of</v>

1292
01:07:19.541 --> 01:07:22.260
<v Speaker 4>pain because stimulant medication,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1293
01:07:22.750 --> 01:07:26.530
<v Speaker 4>has an analgesic properties.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you might want to consult a number of</v>

1294
01:07:26.531 --> 01:07:27.364
<v Speaker 4>specialists about your medication </v>
<v Speaker 4>regimen to see that you're medicated to </v>

1295
01:07:30.761 --> 01:07:31.594
<v Speaker 4>the optimal degree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I would definitely recommend </v>

1296
01:07:32.891 --> 01:07:36.970
<v Speaker 4>antidepressants and also find and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and talking to someone,</v>

1297
01:07:36.971 --> 01:07:37.804
<v Speaker 4>find someone you can trust so that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can talk to him about your genuine </v>

1298
01:07:41.261 --> 01:07:43.150
<v Speaker 4>limitations and how you might transcend </v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

1299
01:07:43.151 --> 01:07:43.984
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and also see if you can not torture </v>

1300
01:07:45.851 --> 01:07:46.684
<v Speaker 4>yourself with guilt because you aren't </v>
<v Speaker 4>able to live the productive life that </v>

1301
01:07:50.651 --> 01:07:52.330
<v Speaker 4>someone who's free of chronic pain </v>
<v Speaker 4>might.</v>

1302
01:07:52.331 --> 01:07:54.280
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it can be unbelievably debilitating.</v>

1303
01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:55.113
<v Speaker 4>So mostly a while.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'm very sorry to hear that that's </v>

1304
01:07:58.811 --> 01:07:59.644
<v Speaker 4>plaguing you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1305
01:07:59.820 --> 01:08:00.653
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1306
01:08:01.990 --> 01:08:04.930
<v Speaker 4>when you say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how can I discipline myself?</v>

1307
01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:08.620
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm afraid I've lost the question.</v>

1308
01:08:09.100 --> 01:08:09.933
<v Speaker 4>You said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how can I discipline myself at </v>

1309
01:08:10.871 --> 01:08:11.704
<v Speaker 4>something?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like how can I discipline myself when </v>

1310
01:08:12.671 --> 01:08:14.710
<v Speaker 4>I'm in chronic pain?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1311
01:08:15.170 --> 01:08:16.003
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think a more appropriate question </v>

1312
01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:22.513
<v Speaker 4>might be how can you ensure you that you</v>
<v Speaker 4>treat yourself with the appropriate </v>

1313
01:08:26.301 --> 01:08:27.134
<v Speaker 4>compassion if you happen to be living </v>
<v Speaker 4>with severe chronic pain and maybe the </v>

1314
01:08:30.651 --> 01:08:32.810
<v Speaker 4>disciplinary element should be </v>
<v Speaker 4>secondary.</v>

1315
01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:34.910
<v Speaker 4>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

1316
01:08:42.540 --> 01:08:44.940
<v Speaker 4>I'm getting tired guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I'm probably gonna stop at nine.</v>

1317
01:08:45.090 --> 01:08:45.923
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to stop at nine 30 because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to start becoming incoherent if I </v>

1318
01:08:48.691 --> 01:08:50.370
<v Speaker 4>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So just to give you a warning,</v>

1319
01:08:50.371 --> 01:08:51.204
<v Speaker 4>we're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to run this for 15 more </v>

1320
01:08:52.501 --> 01:08:56.670
<v Speaker 4>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So is joining the military a respectable</v>

1321
01:08:56.760 --> 01:09:00.840
<v Speaker 4>path for my life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>While I would say it would likely depend</v>

1322
01:09:00.841 --> 01:09:05.460
<v Speaker 4>on how you conduct yourself as a soldier</v>
<v Speaker 4>it and also what your alternatives are.</v>

1323
01:09:05.461 --> 01:09:06.294
<v Speaker 4>But I wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I wouldn't say yes without </v>

1324
01:09:08.071 --> 01:09:08.904
<v Speaker 4>reservation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I certainly wouldn't say no without </v>

1325
01:09:10.261 --> 01:09:11.094
<v Speaker 4>reservation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think joining the military can be a </v>

1326
01:09:13.380 --> 01:09:15.390
<v Speaker 4>respectable pathway for your life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1327
01:09:15.391 --> 01:09:17.370
<v Speaker 4>it's obviously a complex pathway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

1328
01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:20.250
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1329
01:09:20.251 --> 01:09:22.890
<v Speaker 4>it's not like the military isn't a </v>
<v Speaker 4>necessity.</v>

1330
01:09:22.891 --> 01:09:25.920
<v Speaker 4>And so if there's something in you that </v>
<v Speaker 4>tilts you in that direction,</v>

1331
01:09:25.921 --> 01:09:27.070
<v Speaker 4>then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1332
01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:30.540
<v Speaker 4>perhaps that's courage in Utah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's certainly possible.</v>

1333
01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:31.433
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1334
01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:35.220
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's see.</v>

1335
01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:46.260
<v Speaker 4>Let's go back to the pigeon hole thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>

1336
01:09:47.610 --> 01:09:51.150
<v Speaker 4>Becoming a truthful person involves </v>
<v Speaker 4>dealing with the guilt of past lives.</v>

1337
01:09:51.180 --> 01:09:52.013
<v Speaker 4>Is it better to come clean about old </v>
<v Speaker 4>lies even if they will ruin lives or </v>

1338
01:09:54.541 --> 01:09:58.200
<v Speaker 4>forgive yourself and focus on living </v>
<v Speaker 4>truthfully in the present and future?</v>

1339
01:09:58.650 --> 01:10:00.450
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a,</v>

1340
01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:03.060
<v Speaker 4>that's a really good question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1341
01:10:04.290 --> 01:10:06.780
<v Speaker 4>I would say that there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are</v>

1342
01:10:10.250 --> 01:10:11.083
<v Speaker 4>telling the truth doesn't mean saying </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything about everything all the </v>

1343
01:10:16.431 --> 01:10:18.950
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a lot more complicated than that.</v>

1344
01:10:18.951 --> 01:10:21.050
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have a right to privacy.</v>

1345
01:10:21.380 --> 01:10:22.280
<v Speaker 4>And second,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1346
01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:24.290
<v Speaker 4>here's an example.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a tricky one,</v>

1347
01:10:24.770 --> 01:10:27.140
<v Speaker 4>but I think it would address your </v>
<v Speaker 4>question.</v>

1348
01:10:27.710 --> 01:10:30.590
<v Speaker 4>Imagine that you've had an affair,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have a happy marriage,</v>

1349
01:10:30.591 --> 01:10:31.424
<v Speaker 4>but you had an affair and maybe you had </v>
<v Speaker 4>an affair three years ago and maybe it </v>

1350
01:10:33.951 --> 01:10:34.551
<v Speaker 4>was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1351
01:10:34.551 --> 01:10:35.384
<v Speaker 4>a couple of weeks or a couple of months </v>
<v Speaker 4>or maybe it was even only one night and </v>

1352
01:10:38.181 --> 01:10:40.970
<v Speaker 4>it's driving you crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're guilty about it and you feel that</v>

1353
01:10:40.971 --> 01:10:43.100
<v Speaker 4>you should confess.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I would say,</v>

1354
01:10:43.130 --> 01:10:47.300
<v Speaker 4>well the first question is have you </v>
<v Speaker 4>learned your lesson?</v>

1355
01:10:48.260 --> 01:10:53.260
<v Speaker 4>And the lesson should be you've </v>
<v Speaker 4>processed what you've done and decreased</v>

1356
01:10:53.421 --> 01:10:54.254
<v Speaker 4>the probability that you will do it </v>
<v Speaker 4>again to something as closely </v>

1357
01:10:57.021 --> 01:10:57.854
<v Speaker 4>approximating zero as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you have to ask yourself what </v>

1358
01:11:01.461 --> 01:11:04.400
<v Speaker 4>makes you think that you have any right </v>
<v Speaker 4>to confess?</v>

1359
01:11:04.850 --> 01:11:08.960
<v Speaker 4>Because then what you would do is take </v>
<v Speaker 4>the original transgression,</v>

1360
01:11:08.961 --> 01:11:13.830
<v Speaker 4>which was quite severe and hurt someone </v>
<v Speaker 4>very badly revealing it.</v>

1361
01:11:13.831 --> 01:11:14.664
<v Speaker 4>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well you pat yourself on the back for </v>

1362
01:11:15.991 --> 01:11:16.824
<v Speaker 4>being a truthful person about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I would say you've already </v>

1363
01:11:18.871 --> 01:11:23.130
<v Speaker 4>sacrificed the right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to be truthful about that.</v>

1364
01:11:23.750 --> 01:11:24.583
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I know I'm over simplifying it </v>

1365
01:11:26.250 --> 01:11:30.600
<v Speaker 4>because the only way to not oversimplify</v>
<v Speaker 4>is such a thing is to use a real example</v>

1366
01:11:30.601 --> 01:11:31.434
<v Speaker 4>and not a hypothetical example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think many times the moral thing </v>

1367
01:11:34.711 --> 01:11:37.860
<v Speaker 4>to do is to take your guilty secrets to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the grave.</v>

1368
01:11:39.060 --> 01:11:39.893
<v Speaker 4>And maybe you can talk about them with a</v>
<v Speaker 4>therapist or you can talk about them </v>

1369
01:11:42.751 --> 01:11:45.420
<v Speaker 4>with someone that you really trust,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who will maintain confidentiality.</v>

1370
01:11:45.450 --> 01:11:46.320
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1371
01:11:47.370 --> 01:11:48.203
<v Speaker 4>you don't come clean about old lives.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not coming clean about old lies </v>

1372
01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:54.540
<v Speaker 4>generally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if that will ruin lives.</v>

1373
01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:58.290
<v Speaker 4>And I don't think you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you forgive yourself precisely and focus</v>

1374
01:11:58.291 --> 01:11:59.124
<v Speaker 4>on living truthfully in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You focus on living truthfully in the </v>

1375
01:12:01.891 --> 01:12:04.200
<v Speaker 4>future.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And perhaps you don't forgive yourself.</v>

1376
01:12:04.201 --> 01:12:05.034
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't mean you pound yourself </v>

1377
01:12:06.241 --> 01:12:07.074
<v Speaker 4>into the ground with guilt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you have done things in the past </v>

1378
01:12:09.511 --> 01:12:12.240
<v Speaker 4>that were reprehensible and that would </v>
<v Speaker 4>destroy lives,</v>

1379
01:12:12.241 --> 01:12:15.270
<v Speaker 4>if we're brought to light,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you should.</v>

1380
01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:17.333
<v Speaker 4>I think that generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should do everything you can to </v>

1381
01:12:20.071 --> 01:12:20.904
<v Speaker 4>limit the spread of damage as you </v>
<v Speaker 4>attempt to move truthfully into the </v>

1382
01:12:24.601 --> 01:12:26.040
<v Speaker 4>future.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1383
01:12:27.570 --> 01:12:28.403
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've said that a marriage must be </v>

1384
01:12:29.581 --> 01:12:32.460
<v Speaker 4>based on trust and transparency and </v>
<v Speaker 4>being shackled together.</v>

1385
01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:33.533
<v Speaker 4>How,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and for how long should you get to know </v>

1386
01:12:35.371 --> 01:12:37.320
<v Speaker 4>someone?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How does set a foundation?</v>

1387
01:12:37.710 --> 01:12:38.250
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1388
01:12:38.250 --> 01:12:39.570
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no,</v>

1389
01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:41.910
<v Speaker 4>there's no simple answer to that.</v>

1390
01:12:42.310 --> 01:12:43.970
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hello.</v>

1391
01:12:49.990 --> 01:12:54.990
<v Speaker 4>I think that you should know someone </v>
<v Speaker 4>well enough so that you can</v>

1392
01:12:57.810 --> 01:12:58.643
<v Speaker 4>so that you know if you can negotiate </v>
<v Speaker 4>with them and so that you have started </v>

1393
01:13:02.221 --> 01:13:06.210
<v Speaker 4>to formulate a vision of your joint </v>
<v Speaker 4>future that you can both</v>

1394
01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:12.290
<v Speaker 4>look forward to with enthusiasm and </v>
<v Speaker 4>confidence.</v>

1395
01:13:13.180 --> 01:13:14.013
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and of course that's going to depend to </v>

1396
01:13:15.591 --> 01:13:16.424
<v Speaker 4>some degree on your level of maturity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that means you've considered such </v>

1397
01:13:20.571 --> 01:13:24.830
<v Speaker 4>things as,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you have a sufficient number of joint</v>

1398
01:13:24.831 --> 01:13:25.664
<v Speaker 4>interests and are you oriented in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>same direction with regards to how </v>

1399
01:13:28.941 --> 01:13:29.774
<v Speaker 4>you're going to handle your joint </v>
<v Speaker 4>careers and the possibility of children </v>

1400
01:13:32.211 --> 01:13:33.044
<v Speaker 4>and that the manner in which you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to interact with your in laws and </v>

1401
01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:39.830
<v Speaker 4>you have to start thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to start</v>

1402
01:13:41.690 --> 01:13:42.523
<v Speaker 4>considering your life together from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>perspective of practicality and </v>

1403
01:13:45.651 --> 01:13:47.030
<v Speaker 4>economics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say.</v>

1404
01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:48.133
<v Speaker 4>So it can't just be that massive erotic </v>
<v Speaker 4>attraction that's associated with with </v>

1405
01:13:53.511 --> 01:13:54.344
<v Speaker 4>love.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Although I think that's extraordinarily </v>

1406
01:13:55.491 --> 01:13:56.324
<v Speaker 4>important and you're unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 4>fortunate if you have that and you </v>

1407
01:13:58.251 --> 01:14:00.020
<v Speaker 4>should do everything you can to maintain</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

1408
01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:03.110
<v Speaker 4>which and at that takes effort that </v>
<v Speaker 4>takes real effort and will,</v>

1409
01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:04.273
<v Speaker 4>but you need to ally that with with </v>
<v Speaker 4>maturity and intelligence and the </v>

1410
01:14:08.391 --> 01:14:09.950
<v Speaker 4>maturity and intelligence is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1411
01:14:09.951 --> 01:14:12.100
<v Speaker 4>we're going to put our lives together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's</v>

1412
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:14.530
<v Speaker 1>that going to look like at the level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>detail?</v>

1413
01:14:14.710 --> 01:14:17.530
<v Speaker 1>How are we going to handle our finances?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where are we going to live?</v>

1414
01:14:17.830 --> 01:14:20.020
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are our joint plans going to be?</v>

1415
01:14:20.021 --> 01:14:20.854
<v Speaker 1>It's et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that my business </v>

1416
01:14:23.141 --> 01:14:26.890
<v Speaker 1>partners and I plan to do in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1417
01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:28.233
<v Speaker 1>what would you say that in a as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>analog to the self authoring suite is </v>

1418
01:14:32.441 --> 01:14:33.274
<v Speaker 1>that we want to develop an online </v>
<v Speaker 1>program to help people negotiate their </v>

1419
01:14:37.391 --> 01:14:38.224
<v Speaker 1>relationships and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it would actually provide an </v>

1420
01:14:41.141 --> 01:14:45.400
<v Speaker 1>answer to this question in a more </v>
<v Speaker 1>comprehensive manner is that you imagine</v>

1421
01:14:45.401 --> 01:14:47.500
<v Speaker 1>that if you want to set up a household </v>
<v Speaker 1>with someone,</v>

1422
01:14:47.980 --> 01:14:51.430
<v Speaker 1>then there's a lot of things that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to get straight.</v>

1423
01:14:51.431 --> 01:14:52.264
<v Speaker 1>And you either do that by bringing your </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious assumptions to bear on the </v>

1424
01:14:55.721 --> 01:14:56.554
<v Speaker 1>situation and perhaps clashing where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't match or you sit down like a </v>

1425
01:15:01.630 --> 01:15:02.463
<v Speaker 1>conscious and aware and articulate </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple and start to negotiate what your </v>

1426
01:15:06.611 --> 01:15:08.410
<v Speaker 1>joint responsibilities are going to be.</v>

1427
01:15:08.410 --> 01:15:13.410
<v Speaker 1>And so that would be well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's responsible for the meals and when</v>

1428
01:15:13.781 --> 01:15:14.614
<v Speaker 1>and what are you going to eat and who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to get groceries and who's going </v>

1429
01:15:16.631 --> 01:15:17.464
<v Speaker 1>to pay the bills and who's going to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>which part of what household chores </v>

1430
01:15:20.861 --> 01:15:23.110
<v Speaker 1>there are to do and how is that going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be laid out?</v>

1431
01:15:23.111 --> 01:15:26.290
<v Speaker 1>Fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you should get to know,</v>

1432
01:15:26.590 --> 01:15:27.423
<v Speaker 1>you should get to know the person that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're with well enough so that you can </v>

1433
01:15:31.331 --> 01:15:32.164
<v Speaker 1>start discussing the real practical </v>
<v Speaker 1>issues of life and determine whether or </v>

1434
01:15:36.161 --> 01:15:39.160
<v Speaker 1>not you're capable of of negotiating </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1435
01:15:39.190 --> 01:15:40.023
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think that necessarily means</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you should live together because </v>

1436
01:15:43.481 --> 01:15:44.314
<v Speaker 1>the evidence is actually quite strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least the last time I looked at </v>

1437
01:15:48.340 --> 01:15:52.150
<v Speaker 1>people who live together are more rather</v>
<v Speaker 1>than less likely to be divorced.</v>

1438
01:15:52.270 --> 01:15:53.103
<v Speaker 1>Now that might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that might have nothing to do with the </v>

1439
01:15:54.491 --> 01:15:55.900
<v Speaker 1>actual act of living together.</v>

1440
01:15:55.900 --> 01:15:59.380
<v Speaker 1>It might be that people who are more </v>
<v Speaker 1>likely to get divorced or also those who</v>

1441
01:15:59.381 --> 01:16:00.214
<v Speaker 1>are more likely to merely live together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think that's a great </v>

1442
01:16:02.381 --> 01:16:05.800
<v Speaker 1>solution for reasons I won't get to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>get into now.</v>

1443
01:16:06.190 --> 01:16:08.980
<v Speaker 1>And with regards to being shackled </v>
<v Speaker 1>together is that,</v>

1444
01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:11.010
<v Speaker 1>that's a complicated one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1445
01:16:11.050 --> 01:16:15.190
<v Speaker 1>and I learned this at least in part from</v>
<v Speaker 1>reading Carl Young and the idea there is</v>

1446
01:16:15.191 --> 01:16:16.024
<v Speaker 1>that unless you've really made a </v>
<v Speaker 1>commitment to someone like a lifetime </v>

1447
01:16:20.351 --> 01:16:23.140
<v Speaker 1>commitment and that that's a serious </v>
<v Speaker 1>commitment,</v>

1448
01:16:23.141 --> 01:16:24.900
<v Speaker 1>one that you're not going to back out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1449
01:16:25.330 --> 01:16:28.450
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to take the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with the seriousness that's</v>

1450
01:16:28.451 --> 01:16:29.284
<v Speaker 1>necessary to make it have the highest </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible quality and sustainability </v>

1451
01:16:32.861 --> 01:16:33.694
<v Speaker 1>across the course of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's really important that it is of </v>

1452
01:16:36.161 --> 01:16:39.220
<v Speaker 1>that high quality and sustainability </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the relationship,</v>

1453
01:16:39.490 --> 01:16:41.500
<v Speaker 1>especially when it starts to produce </v>
<v Speaker 1>children,</v>

1454
01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:43.090
<v Speaker 1>is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a machine,</v>

1455
01:16:43.091 --> 01:16:43.924
<v Speaker 1>let's say a machine that you jointly </v>
<v Speaker 1>operate that adds immensely to the </v>

1456
01:16:47.051 --> 01:16:49.240
<v Speaker 1>quality of your life and the depth of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your life.</v>

1457
01:16:49.690 --> 01:16:50.523
<v Speaker 1>I mean you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have the rope and strand of your </v>

1458
01:16:52.931 --> 01:16:56.890
<v Speaker 1>life and your partner has the strands in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rope of his or her life.</v>

1459
01:16:56.891 --> 01:16:59.800
<v Speaker 1>And then those are tied together to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>a stronger rope.</v>

1460
01:17:00.190 --> 01:17:01.023
<v Speaker 1>And then that unites you across time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you undertake massive </v>

1461
01:17:04.481 --> 01:17:07.360
<v Speaker 1>adventures together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some of that is the establishment of</v>

1462
01:17:07.361 --> 01:17:10.100
<v Speaker 1>a household and the establishment of </v>
<v Speaker 1>joint careers and</v>

1463
01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:10.933
<v Speaker 4>the maintenance of each other's mental </v>
<v Speaker 4>and physical health and the maintenance </v>

1464
01:17:13.491 --> 01:17:15.740
<v Speaker 4>of a high quality sexual life and all of</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1465
01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:17.750
<v Speaker 4>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very challenging to do all of that.</v>

1466
01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:22.730
<v Speaker 4>And then the joint production end and </v>
<v Speaker 4>care of children,</v>

1467
01:17:22.731 --> 01:17:23.564
<v Speaker 4>which,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which sets you up properly for the last </v>

1468
01:17:25.611 --> 01:17:26.630
<v Speaker 4>half of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like,</v>

1469
01:17:26.631 --> 01:17:28.010
<v Speaker 4>I'm 55 now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1470
01:17:28.011 --> 01:17:28.844
<v Speaker 4>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>both my kids just got engaged in the </v>

1471
01:17:31.910 --> 01:17:33.620
<v Speaker 4>last month,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that's pretty bloody amazing.</v>

1472
01:17:33.860 --> 01:17:36.380
<v Speaker 4>And they're both setting up households </v>
<v Speaker 4>and um,</v>

1473
01:17:37.220 --> 01:17:40.730
<v Speaker 4>and there are stepping into adulthood </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm fortunate enough to have them in</v>

1474
01:17:40.731 --> 01:17:43.070
<v Speaker 4>the city that I live in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So Hooray for me,</v>

1475
01:17:43.071 --> 01:17:44.430
<v Speaker 4>that's so bloody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1476
01:17:44.780 --> 01:17:46.520
<v Speaker 4>fortunate that I can hardly believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1477
01:17:46.521 --> 01:17:48.230
<v Speaker 4>we've helped them out and tried to make </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1478
01:17:48.780 --> 01:17:49.613
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what would you say to make the </v>

1479
01:17:52.161 --> 01:17:55.100
<v Speaker 4>possibility of their living here be </v>
<v Speaker 4>something that's viable?</v>

1480
01:17:55.101 --> 01:17:55.934
<v Speaker 4>But I'm absolutely thrilled that they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be around and I'm looking </v>

1481
01:17:57.831 --> 01:18:01.370
<v Speaker 4>forward immensely to having </v>
<v Speaker 4>grandchildren and like,</v>

1482
01:18:01.371 --> 01:18:04.160
<v Speaker 4>what else are you going to do when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're 55,</v>

1483
01:18:04.550 --> 01:18:06.170
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're going to be 55,</v>

1484
01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:08.210
<v Speaker 4>it's going to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I might have 40 more years.</v>

1485
01:18:08.210 --> 01:18:10.340
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what am I going to do with those years?</v>

1486
01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:12.110
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I have a good marriage,</v>

1487
01:18:12.111 --> 01:18:15.470
<v Speaker 4>thank God for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's partly due to the outstanding</v>

1488
01:18:15.471 --> 01:18:17.300
<v Speaker 4>moral quality of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My wife,</v>

1489
01:18:17.470 --> 01:18:19.550
<v Speaker 4>who I'm also extraordinarily attracted </v>
<v Speaker 4>to.</v>

1490
01:18:19.940 --> 01:18:20.773
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1491
01:18:20.810 --> 01:18:21.643
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've built a life together and we've </v>

1492
01:18:22.341 --> 01:18:24.410
<v Speaker 4>had kids together and we're happy with </v>
<v Speaker 4>our kids.</v>

1493
01:18:24.411 --> 01:18:28.010
<v Speaker 4>And we had plenty of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of struggle with our kids because one of</v>

1494
01:18:28.011 --> 01:18:30.230
<v Speaker 4>our children,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my daughter had serious,</v>

1495
01:18:30.231 --> 01:18:31.064
<v Speaker 4>serious health problems,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which she seems to have managed to </v>

1496
01:18:33.981 --> 01:18:37.130
<v Speaker 4>resolve partly as a consequence of her </v>
<v Speaker 4>own brilliance.</v>

1497
01:18:37.610 --> 01:18:39.770
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

1498
01:18:39.771 --> 01:18:40.604
<v Speaker 4>we've set ourselves up now so that our </v>
<v Speaker 4>children are respectable and mature </v>

1499
01:18:44.001 --> 01:18:45.950
<v Speaker 4>young adults.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So thank God for that.</v>

1500
01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:48.800
<v Speaker 4>And they've got partners who we both </v>
<v Speaker 4>really like,</v>

1501
01:18:48.801 --> 01:18:51.500
<v Speaker 4>and they're going to have children and </v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1502
01:18:51.501 --> 01:18:52.281
<v Speaker 4>Hooray.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1503
01:18:52.281 --> 01:18:55.580
<v Speaker 4>that means that this next part of my </v>
<v Speaker 4>life is going to be something that I can</v>

1504
01:18:55.581 --> 01:18:58.550
<v Speaker 4>advance into with a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with a fair bit of hope and,</v>

1505
01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:00.350
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and excitement.</v>

1506
01:19:00.350 --> 01:19:02.420
<v Speaker 4>And the idea of having little kids </v>
<v Speaker 4>around again,</v>

1507
01:19:02.421 --> 01:19:04.430
<v Speaker 4>it's thrilling because I really liked </v>
<v Speaker 4>the little kids.</v>

1508
01:19:04.431 --> 01:19:05.930
<v Speaker 4>They're really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really fun.</v>

1509
01:19:06.410 --> 01:19:10.220
<v Speaker 4>And so th the shackled together is more </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1510
01:19:10.221 --> 01:19:11.150
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1511
01:19:11.230 --> 01:19:12.320
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's such a,</v>

1512
01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:13.393
<v Speaker 4>I may have even said that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's such a cynical way of looking </v>

1513
01:19:15.141 --> 01:19:15.974
<v Speaker 4>at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's more like what you've produced is </v>

1514
01:19:16.911 --> 01:19:21.911
<v Speaker 4>an unbreakable bond between two beings </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that that makes both of them,</v>

1515
01:19:22.610 --> 01:19:25.880
<v Speaker 4>both of them better in every way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it's based on,</v>

1516
01:19:25.881 --> 01:19:29.000
<v Speaker 4>if it's a relationship that's based on </v>
<v Speaker 4>trust and genuine communication,</v>

1517
01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:30.193
<v Speaker 4>it's very difficult thing to attain </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you have to be willing to tell </v>

1518
01:19:32.841 --> 01:19:33.674
<v Speaker 4>the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the truth is terror generally a </v>

1519
01:19:34.881 --> 01:19:36.650
<v Speaker 4>horrible thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1520
01:19:36.651 --> 01:19:37.484
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's easy to tell truth when everyone </v>

1521
01:19:38.871 --> 01:19:39.704
<v Speaker 4>wants to hear what you have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's very difficult to tell the </v>

1522
01:19:41.541 --> 01:19:44.540
<v Speaker 4>truth when no one wants to hear it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>least of all yourself.</v>

1523
01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:48.980
<v Speaker 4>And so marriage gets a very bad rap in </v>
<v Speaker 4>our culture and Sodas,</v>

1524
01:19:49.370 --> 01:19:50.203
<v Speaker 4>child rearing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's absolute catastrophe </v>

1525
01:19:51.981 --> 01:19:56.600
<v Speaker 4>because really being in a longterm </v>
<v Speaker 4>relationship,</v>

1526
01:19:56.601 --> 01:19:59.480
<v Speaker 4>a marriage let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and having children,</v>

1527
01:19:59.510 --> 01:20:00.343
<v Speaker 4>that's two thirds of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even if you're a highly career oriented </v>

1528
01:20:03.501 --> 01:20:05.420
<v Speaker 4>person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's two thirds of your life.</v>

1529
01:20:05.421 --> 01:20:08.220
<v Speaker 4>And I'm a highly career oriented and</v>

1530
01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:09.533
<v Speaker 1>my family has been unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 1>important to me and has also been </v>

1531
01:20:12.151 --> 01:20:12.984
<v Speaker 1>something that's enabled me to be very </v>
<v Speaker 1>effective in my career because my house </v>

1532
01:20:16.261 --> 01:20:18.630
<v Speaker 1>has been a sanctuary for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And thank God for that,</v>

1533
01:20:18.631 --> 01:20:20.670
<v Speaker 1>especially over or many times in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

1534
01:20:20.671 --> 01:20:23.250
<v Speaker 1>but especially over the last year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1535
01:20:24.780 --> 01:20:25.613
<v Speaker 1>you should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should get to know someone long </v>

1536
01:20:27.751 --> 01:20:31.110
<v Speaker 1>enough to know that you two can </v>
<v Speaker 1>negotiate,</v>

1537
01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:34.680
<v Speaker 1>tell the truth with each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate and negotiate.</v>

1538
01:20:34.710 --> 01:20:35.543
<v Speaker 1>Because the most important part of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship is the fact that you can </v>

1539
01:20:38.041 --> 01:20:38.874
<v Speaker 1>tell each other the truth and negotiate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how does it feel to be viewed as a </v>

1540
01:20:42.661 --> 01:20:44.940
<v Speaker 1>father figure by many people who grew up</v>
<v Speaker 1>without one?</v>

1541
01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:46.073
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1542
01:20:46.380 --> 01:20:49.260
<v Speaker 1>I think it's an unbelievable honor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How's that?</v>

1543
01:20:49.740 --> 01:20:50.573
<v Speaker 1>And that is really what I think as it </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets a tremendous honor and I'm doing </v>

1544
01:20:53.820 --> 01:20:57.540
<v Speaker 1>absolutely everything I can to be worthy</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>

1545
01:20:57.540 --> 01:20:58.373
<v Speaker 1>And I would like to say to all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people out there who grew up without a </v>

1546
01:21:00.901 --> 01:21:03.900
<v Speaker 1>father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really too bad because you need a</v>

1547
01:21:03.901 --> 01:21:04.734
<v Speaker 1>father there to encourage you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what fathers do is they </v>

1548
01:21:07.801 --> 01:21:10.950
<v Speaker 1>encourage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they help make you courageous.</v>

1549
01:21:11.190 --> 01:21:12.023
<v Speaker 1>And if I can help people develop the </v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity to be courageous and to learn </v>

1550
01:21:15.931 --> 01:21:19.200
<v Speaker 1>to tell the truth and to be responsible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that's great.</v>

1551
01:21:19.201 --> 01:21:19.880
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1552
01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:20.713
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine a better outcome for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if people are willing to help me </v>

1553
01:21:24.391 --> 01:21:29.391
<v Speaker 1>play that role and to use what I've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>teaching to guide them in that manner,</v>

1554
01:21:29.431 --> 01:21:30.264
<v Speaker 1>then hooray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't possibly imagine a better </v>

1555
01:21:32.221 --> 01:21:34.020
<v Speaker 1>outcome than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1556
01:21:36.420 --> 01:21:39.360
<v Speaker 1>how do you formulate good questions?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Giving that a well,</v>

1557
01:21:39.390 --> 01:21:40.223
<v Speaker 1>given that a well oriented question </v>
<v Speaker 1>seems often more critical than the </v>

1558
01:21:42.571 --> 01:21:44.550
<v Speaker 1>answer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a great question by the way.</v>

1559
01:21:44.970 --> 01:21:45.803
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of what you do to formulate good </v>

1560
01:21:47.491 --> 01:21:48.660
<v Speaker 1>questions is listen.</v>

1561
01:21:49.380 --> 01:21:50.213
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're engaged in dialogue with </v>

1562
01:21:51.751 --> 01:21:53.880
<v Speaker 1>someone and you really listen to what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're saying,</v>

1563
01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:58.710
<v Speaker 1>the all you have to do is notice when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't understand what they're saying</v>

1564
01:21:58.980 --> 01:21:59.813
<v Speaker 1>and then ask them for clarification.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the case when you're dealing </v>

1565
01:22:02.731 --> 01:22:05.940
<v Speaker 1>with the w the factual world as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1566
01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:09.570
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you do to formulate good questions.</v>

1567
01:22:09.571 --> 01:22:10.404
<v Speaker 1>It is admit your own ignorance to </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself and then tried to articulate </v>

1568
01:22:14.551 --> 01:22:17.640
<v Speaker 1>that ignorance as clearly and simply as </v>
<v Speaker 1>you possibly can.</v>

1569
01:22:18.150 --> 01:22:18.983
<v Speaker 1>And so I do that all the time when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>in my clinical sessions with people </v>

1570
01:22:21.211 --> 01:22:25.530
<v Speaker 1>because there'll be telling me the story</v>
<v Speaker 1>of their life years ago perhaps,</v>

1571
01:22:25.531 --> 01:22:27.840
<v Speaker 1>or maybe events over the last few weeks </v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever.</v>

1572
01:22:27.841 --> 01:22:28.674
<v Speaker 1>And they'll tell me the story and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all detect elements of it that I </v>

1573
01:22:32.491 --> 01:22:35.940
<v Speaker 1>don't understand or that are unclear or </v>
<v Speaker 1>that seem self contradictory.</v>

1574
01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:37.860
<v Speaker 1>And so then I'll just ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it says,</v>

1575
01:22:37.861 --> 01:22:38.430
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1576
01:22:38.430 --> 01:22:40.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand what you're saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1577
01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:42.660
<v Speaker 1>You said this as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that wasn't clear.</v>

1578
01:22:42.661 --> 01:22:45.660
<v Speaker 1>What exactly do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so a huge,</v>

1579
01:22:45.750 --> 01:22:47.520
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and get them to articulate it.</v>

1580
01:22:47.521 --> 01:22:48.690
<v Speaker 1>And maybe I'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1581
01:22:48.691 --> 01:22:50.910
<v Speaker 1>you said this now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you said this,</v>

1582
01:22:50.911 --> 01:22:51.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 minutes ago.</v>

1583
01:22:51.961 --> 01:22:54.660
<v Speaker 1>And as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those two things are opposites.</v>

1584
01:22:54.661 --> 01:22:55.494
<v Speaker 1>And so how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you bridge the gap between those </v>

1585
01:22:59.311 --> 01:23:00.144
<v Speaker 1>things?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1586
01:23:00.270 --> 01:23:01.103
<v Speaker 1>but the critical issue with regards to </v>
<v Speaker 1>good questions is that you admit to </v>

1587
01:23:03.961 --> 01:23:06.100
<v Speaker 1>yourself your own ignorance and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not embarrassed</v>

1588
01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:06.933
<v Speaker 4>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there's nothing wrong with being </v>

1589
01:23:07.841 --> 01:23:09.580
<v Speaker 4>ignorant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that's not true.</v>

1590
01:23:09.700 --> 01:23:12.040
<v Speaker 4>It's a terrible thing to be ignorant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's inevitable.</v>

1591
01:23:12.490 --> 01:23:16.390
<v Speaker 4>But it's not a moral flaw.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just unfortunate.</v>

1592
01:23:16.570 --> 01:23:19.570
<v Speaker 4>The moral flaw is in refusing to admit </v>
<v Speaker 4>to it.</v>

1593
01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:21.400
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1594
01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:23.193
<v Speaker 4>the students who do really well in </v>
<v Speaker 4>classes are the ones who ask basic </v>

1595
01:23:26.111 --> 01:23:27.550
<v Speaker 4>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They put up their hand and say,</v>

1596
01:23:27.551 --> 01:23:28.270
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1597
01:23:28.270 --> 01:23:30.070
<v Speaker 4>everyone else here seems to understand </v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

1598
01:23:30.071 --> 01:23:32.080
<v Speaker 4>but this is a point that I really don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>get.</v>

1599
01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:33.273
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rarely a person asks a question like </v>

1600
01:23:35.981 --> 01:23:36.814
<v Speaker 4>that and they haven't been listening and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they haven't been paying attention and </v>

1601
01:23:39.281 --> 01:23:40.114
<v Speaker 4>they're just being annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But most of the time people who do that </v>

1602
01:23:43.481 --> 01:23:44.314
<v Speaker 4>have been paying attention and they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>asking a question that everyone else in </v>

1603
01:23:46.781 --> 01:23:49.300
<v Speaker 4>the room would also like to ask but is </v>
<v Speaker 4>embarrassed to do so.</v>

1604
01:23:49.780 --> 01:23:51.350
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1605
01:23:52.410 --> 01:23:53.243
<v Speaker 4>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You said that positive emotion comes </v>

1606
01:23:55.631 --> 01:23:56.464
<v Speaker 4>from moving towards a goal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also that friends and family are </v>

1607
01:23:58.181 --> 01:24:00.040
<v Speaker 4>crucial,</v>
<v Speaker 4>critical to a fulfilling life.</v>

1608
01:24:00.041 --> 01:24:02.110
<v Speaker 4>Are both of these hitting the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>neural circuits?</v>

1609
01:24:02.380 --> 01:24:04.330
<v Speaker 4>I would say no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not precisely.</v>

1610
01:24:04.331 --> 01:24:05.164
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the positive emotion that comes from </v>

1611
01:24:06.551 --> 01:24:09.790
<v Speaker 4>moving towards a goal looks to me to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>primarily dopaminergic.</v>

1612
01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:11.313
<v Speaker 4>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the positive emotion that's associated </v>

1613
01:24:13.301 --> 01:24:15.790
<v Speaker 4>with friends and family,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think is much more associated with the</v>

1614
01:24:15.791 --> 01:24:16.624
<v Speaker 4>opiate system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And some of the best work on that was </v>

1615
01:24:18.311 --> 01:24:20.380
<v Speaker 4>done by Jaak Panksepp,</v>
<v Speaker 4>j a,</v>

1616
01:24:20.381 --> 01:24:21.670
<v Speaker 4>k,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Panksepp,</v>

1617
01:24:21.671 --> 01:24:22.191
<v Speaker 4>p,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

1618
01:24:22.191 --> 01:24:22.701
<v Speaker 4>n,</v>
<v Speaker 4>k,</v>

1619
01:24:22.701 --> 01:24:23.620
<v Speaker 4>s,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Epp.</v>

1620
01:24:23.621 --> 01:24:26.950
<v Speaker 4>And he wrote a book called affective </v>
<v Speaker 4>neuroscience and a variety of very,</v>

1621
01:24:26.951 --> 01:24:27.784
<v Speaker 4>very good scientific papers and laid </v>
<v Speaker 4>some of the initial groundwork for </v>

1622
01:24:30.491 --> 01:24:34.600
<v Speaker 4>understanding the relationship between </v>
<v Speaker 4>the functioning of the endogenous opiate</v>

1623
01:24:34.601 --> 01:24:37.270
<v Speaker 4>systems and social bonding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So no,</v>

1624
01:24:37.271 --> 01:24:38.350
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they're the same.</v>

1625
01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:39.353
<v Speaker 4>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they share overlap because the opiate </v>

1626
01:24:40.991 --> 01:24:44.200
<v Speaker 4>circuits can activate the dopaminergic </v>
<v Speaker 4>circuits.</v>

1627
01:24:44.610 --> 01:24:45.443
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

1628
01:24:45.850 --> 01:24:46.683
<v Speaker 4>but there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are definitely differences in the </v>

1629
01:24:48.911 --> 01:24:49.840
<v Speaker 4>system that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1630
01:24:50.230 --> 01:24:51.063
<v Speaker 4>that seeks out goals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's the system that Panksepp </v>

1631
01:24:53.231 --> 01:24:54.064
<v Speaker 4>actually called the seeking system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the dopaminergic system and the </v>

1632
01:24:56.591 --> 01:24:57.424
<v Speaker 4>more affiliate of systems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there are definitely overlapping but </v>

1633
01:25:00.161 --> 01:25:01.990
<v Speaker 4>separate neural circuits.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

1634
01:25:02.870 --> 01:25:03.703
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have to take away from your </v>

1635
01:25:06.971 --> 01:25:08.560
<v Speaker 4>interpretations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but for a skeptic,</v>

1636
01:25:08.561 --> 01:25:11.620
<v Speaker 4>how do you know that your analysis of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Biblical stories are true?</v>

1637
01:25:11.980 --> 01:25:13.540
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a great question,</v>

1638
01:25:13.541 --> 01:25:16.210
<v Speaker 4>but the issue there is what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you mean by true?</v>

1639
01:25:17.380 --> 01:25:18.213
<v Speaker 4>I would say there are functional because</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a pragmatist and I mean that </v>

1640
01:25:21.791 --> 01:25:22.624
<v Speaker 4>technically I believe that our </v>
<v Speaker 4>conceptual structures are tools to help </v>

1641
01:25:25.691 --> 01:25:29.620
<v Speaker 4>us orient ourselves in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the issue for me is,</v>

1642
01:25:29.860 --> 01:25:33.340
<v Speaker 4>are the interpretations that I'm making </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the biblical stories,</v>

1643
01:25:33.970 --> 01:25:38.050
<v Speaker 4>useful functional tools for people to </v>
<v Speaker 4>use to operate in the world?</v>

1644
01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:43.330
<v Speaker 4>And how can I demonstrate that their </v>
<v Speaker 4>canonical interpretations of the Bible?</v>

1645
01:25:43.540 --> 01:25:45.640
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't demonstrate that.</v>

1646
01:25:45.670 --> 01:25:46.503
<v Speaker 4>What I can say is that people can listen</v>
<v Speaker 4>to them and make their own judgment </v>

1647
01:25:49.271 --> 01:25:51.940
<v Speaker 4>about whether or not they're useful and </v>
<v Speaker 4>valid,</v>

1648
01:25:52.210 --> 01:25:55.570
<v Speaker 4>which I think is a better way of </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking about it then then true.</v>

1649
01:25:55.720 --> 01:26:00.130
<v Speaker 4>Because truth in literature and </v>
<v Speaker 4>mythology is a very tricky concept.</v>

1650
01:26:00.131 --> 01:26:00.964
<v Speaker 4>And especially in a book like the Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which as I pointed out in the first </v>

1651
01:26:03.771 --> 01:26:08.660
<v Speaker 4>Biblical lecture is the first truly </v>
<v Speaker 4>hyperlinked text where every,</v>

1652
01:26:08.930 --> 01:26:12.920
<v Speaker 4>almost every verse interacts with almost</v>
<v Speaker 4>every other verse.</v>

1653
01:26:13.190 --> 01:26:14.023
<v Speaker 4>And so it's an end.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's endlessly deep and there's an </v>

1654
01:26:17.450 --> 01:26:18.283
<v Speaker 4>endless number in some sense of valid </v>
<v Speaker 4>interpretations that could come forth </v>

1655
01:26:21.381 --> 01:26:22.550
<v Speaker 4>from it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

1656
01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:24.033
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1657
01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:25.650
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1658
01:26:25.650 --> 01:26:27.980
<v Speaker 4>there's more to the answer to that </v>
<v Speaker 4>question,</v>

1659
01:26:27.981 --> 01:26:30.740
<v Speaker 4>but I can't go into it for now because </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

1660
01:26:30.980 --> 01:26:31.813
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're running out of time and I'm </v>

1661
01:26:32.241 --> 01:26:33.380
<v Speaker 4>running out of energy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>

1662
01:26:33.381 --> 01:26:35.350
<v Speaker 4>it is nine 30 and so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1663
01:26:37.070 --> 01:26:39.200
<v Speaker 4>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and my daughter has just showed up in my</v>

1664
01:26:39.201 --> 01:26:40.034
<v Speaker 4>wife has told me that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I think I'm actually going to take </v>

1665
01:26:41.751 --> 01:26:44.990
<v Speaker 4>this opportunity to bow out and to say </v>
<v Speaker 4>once again,</v>

1666
01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:46.030
<v Speaker 4>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1667
01:26:46.340 --> 01:26:50.460
<v Speaker 4>this is my wife by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I might as well what</v>

1668
01:26:52.670 --> 01:26:55.040
<v Speaker 4>I was watching the video and I thought </v>
<v Speaker 4>she was still in the room.</v>

1669
01:26:55.041 --> 01:26:55.874
<v Speaker 4>The video is lagged.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I was actually interacting with a </v>

1670
01:26:58.041 --> 01:26:59.630
<v Speaker 4>ghost there for a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1671
01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:02.510
<v Speaker 4>I wanted to thank you all again for </v>
<v Speaker 4>supporting me.</v>

1672
01:27:02.710 --> 01:27:03.543
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I also want to say I know that for you </v>

1673
01:27:05.271 --> 01:27:10.271
<v Speaker 4>patrons that have been supporting me for</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the $200 level,</v>

1674
01:27:10.730 --> 01:27:11.563
<v Speaker 4>I know that I promise to give you </v>
<v Speaker 4>producer credit on the biblical videos </v>

1675
01:27:15.171 --> 01:27:16.310
<v Speaker 4>and I haven't forgotten that.</v>

1676
01:27:16.310 --> 01:27:19.970
<v Speaker 4>I just haven't done it yet because I </v>
<v Speaker 4>would like to say because I'd been doing</v>

1677
01:27:19.971 --> 01:27:22.340
<v Speaker 4>a bunch of other things and I do </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually believe that's true,</v>

1678
01:27:22.341 --> 01:27:24.470
<v Speaker 4>but I haven't forgotten and I still want</v>
<v Speaker 4>to do it.</v>

1679
01:27:24.471 --> 01:27:29.471
<v Speaker 4>And I think it is important and you have</v>
<v Speaker 4>been crucial to the production of these,</v>

1680
01:27:29.690 --> 01:27:31.640
<v Speaker 4>this series,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of you patrion supporters.</v>

1681
01:27:31.641 --> 01:27:32.474
<v Speaker 4>And I'm hoping that I can continue to </v>
<v Speaker 4>put the support that you've been </v>

1682
01:27:34.881 --> 01:27:37.730
<v Speaker 4>offering me to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to ever better use.</v>

1683
01:27:37.731 --> 01:27:42.440
<v Speaker 4>And hopefully you can also help guide me</v>
<v Speaker 4>in doing that in these q and a's because</v>

1684
01:27:42.441 --> 01:27:43.790
<v Speaker 4>it gives us a chance to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1685
01:27:44.450 --> 01:27:46.040
<v Speaker 4>to communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1686
01:27:46.041 --> 01:27:48.170
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1687
01:27:48.171 --> 01:27:53.171
<v Speaker 4>so I'm going to say good night and </v>
<v Speaker 4>thanks a lot to all of you and we'll see</v>

1688
01:27:53.271 --> 01:27:55.320
<v Speaker 4>you in a month.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1689
01:27:56.120 --> 01:27:57.440
<v Speaker 4>get your act together,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of you,</v>

1690
01:27:57.441 --> 01:27:59.120
<v Speaker 4>and do what you can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1691
01:27:59.180 --> 01:28:02.630
<v Speaker 4>It'd be a wonderful thing to see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if enough people start doing that,</v>

1692
01:28:02.631 --> 01:28:04.220
<v Speaker 4>maybe we can turn this whole mess </v>
<v Speaker 4>around.</v>

1693
01:28:04.490 --> 01:28:07.190
<v Speaker 4>That'd be lovely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And maybe it won't take that many people</v>

1694
01:28:07.191 --> 01:28:09.410
<v Speaker 4>to start it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that'd be a good goal.</v>

1695
01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:11.660
<v Speaker 4>So good night.</v>
