1
00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.810
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness again today.</v>

2
00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:10.123
<v Speaker 2>MMM.</v>

3
00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.450
<v Speaker 1>Its division into industrious in</v>
<v Speaker 1>orderliness is relatively new.</v>

4
00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.190
<v Speaker 1>Those separable elements of</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness of only or you're</v>

5
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.130
<v Speaker 1>going are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've only been established since 2007 I</v>

6
00:00:27.131 --> 00:00:32.131
<v Speaker 1>talked to you a couple of weeks ago</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the relationship between the</v>

7
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.840
<v Speaker 1>relationship that I was hypothesizing</v>
<v Speaker 1>between disgust,</v>

8
00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.250
<v Speaker 1>disgust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sensitivity,</v>

9
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.280
<v Speaker 1>contamination and dominance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy status,</v>

10
00:00:42.281 --> 00:00:44.140
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was trying to tie that into</v>

11
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:45.763
<v Speaker 2>mmm.</v>

12
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.220
<v Speaker 1>The degree to which someone's belief</v>
<v Speaker 1>systems would assure their status and</v>

13
00:00:54.361 --> 00:00:56.910
<v Speaker 1>safety in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I want to continue with that</v>

14
00:00:56.911 --> 00:01:00.210
<v Speaker 1>discussion today</v>
<v Speaker 1>and narrow it,</v>

15
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.620
<v Speaker 1>narrow it to some degree as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well as broadening it and others.</v>

16
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.313
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

17
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.780
<v Speaker 1>So conscientiousness is a sub element of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the meditates stability and the</v>

18
00:01:15.541 --> 00:01:20.541
<v Speaker 1>correlation between industriousness and</v>
<v Speaker 1>orderliness is relatively low.</v>

19
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.560
<v Speaker 1>Given that there are two elements of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same trait.</v>

20
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.970
<v Speaker 1>So for openness and intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see that there's a correlation of</v>

21
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.030
<v Speaker 1>0.35 that's the lowest plasticity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plasticity aspect,</v>

22
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.150
<v Speaker 1>inter correlation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then for conscientiousness it's r</v>

23
00:01:42.151 --> 00:01:44.910
<v Speaker 1>equals 0.39 for industriousness and</v>
<v Speaker 1>orderliness.</v>

24
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.190
<v Speaker 1>Now here's the basic items for</v>
<v Speaker 1>orderliness and industriousness.</v>

25
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.150
<v Speaker 1>So for orderliness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>its leaves belongings around,</v>

26
00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.990
<v Speaker 1>obviously that's negatively scored.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Likes order,</v>

27
00:01:59.991 --> 00:02:02.210
<v Speaker 1>keeps things tidy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>follows a schedule,</v>

28
00:02:02.211 --> 00:02:06.590
<v Speaker 1>is not bothered by messy people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants everything to be just right is not</v>

29
00:02:06.591 --> 00:02:07.970
<v Speaker 1>bothered by disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dislikes.</v>

30
00:02:07.971 --> 00:02:11.480
<v Speaker 1>Routine seals sees that rules are</v>
<v Speaker 1>observed,</v>

31
00:02:11.481 --> 00:02:16.481
<v Speaker 1>wants every detail taken care of and for</v>
<v Speaker 1>industriousness carries out his or her</v>

32
00:02:16.761 --> 00:02:19.250
<v Speaker 1>plans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wastes time negatively scored,</v>

33
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.740
<v Speaker 1>finds it difficult to get down to work</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

34
00:02:21.741 --> 00:02:22.940
<v Speaker 1>negatively scored,</v>
<v Speaker 1>messes,</v>

35
00:02:22.941 --> 00:02:25.240
<v Speaker 1>things up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>finishes what he,</v>

36
00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.560
<v Speaker 1>she starts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't put his or her mind on the task</v>

37
00:02:27.561 --> 00:02:29.150
<v Speaker 1>at hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets things done quickly,</v>

38
00:02:29.151 --> 00:02:32.870
<v Speaker 1>always knows what he or she is doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Postpones decisions and is easily</v>

39
00:02:32.871 --> 00:02:36.140
<v Speaker 1>distracted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a decisiveness that seems to go</v>

40
00:02:36.141 --> 00:02:39.350
<v Speaker 1>along with industriousness and</v>
<v Speaker 1>efficiency.</v>

41
00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.350
<v Speaker 1>With orderliness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there seems to be something that's</v>

42
00:02:45.351 --> 00:02:49.100
<v Speaker 1>associated with the desire for</v>
<v Speaker 1>categorical stability.</v>

43
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.880
<v Speaker 1>Now I have a sneaking suspicion that our</v>
<v Speaker 1>propensity to categorize the human</v>

44
00:02:55.071 --> 00:03:00.071
<v Speaker 1>propensity to categorize is more tightly</v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with disgust sensitivity than</v>

45
00:03:00.101 --> 00:03:03.220
<v Speaker 1>we might think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I believe that is because</v>

46
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.910
<v Speaker 1>we're omnivores and that means that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to make a lot of very complicated</v>

47
00:03:06.911 --> 00:03:08.050
<v Speaker 1>decisions about food.</v>

48
00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.093
<v Speaker 2>Now</v>

49
00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.780
<v Speaker 1>here's part of the problem with</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness.</v>

50
00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.310
<v Speaker 1>There's no theoretical model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no neuropsychological model.</v>

51
00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.740
<v Speaker 1>So we don't know how to integrate</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness into,</v>

52
00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.660
<v Speaker 1>into neuroscience in general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no psychological model except</v>

53
00:03:26.661 --> 00:03:30.080
<v Speaker 1>that we know you can measure it with</v>
<v Speaker 1>self report and there's no</v>

54
00:03:30.081 --> 00:03:32.630
<v Speaker 1>pharmacological model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have no idea.</v>

55
00:03:32.631 --> 00:03:34.070
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with anxiety.</v>

56
00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.250
<v Speaker 1>So neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Serotonin,</v>

57
00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.780
<v Speaker 1>Serotonin reuptake inhibitors and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Benzodiazepines,</v>

58
00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.340
<v Speaker 1>barbiturates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an alcohol all work to decrease negative</v>

59
00:03:43.341 --> 00:03:47.210
<v Speaker 1>emotion and dopamine agonists work to</v>
<v Speaker 1>increase positive emotion.</v>

60
00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.470
<v Speaker 1>And oxytocin works for agreeableness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It heightens agreeableness.</v>

61
00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.500
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can even do pharmacological</v>

62
00:03:54.501 --> 00:03:57.170
<v Speaker 1>manipulations to change openness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

63
00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.440
<v Speaker 1>one of the most recent studies done on</v>
<v Speaker 1>siliciden mushrooms,</v>

64
00:04:00.441 --> 00:04:04.100
<v Speaker 1>it was the first study done on</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelics for,</v>

65
00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.650
<v Speaker 1>for probably 40 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>showed that,</v>

66
00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:08.630
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

67
00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.930
<v Speaker 1>one dose of Psilocybin mushrooms</v>
<v Speaker 1>produced a one standard deviation</v>

68
00:04:11.931 --> 00:04:16.190
<v Speaker 1>increase in openness one year later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is staggering.</v>

69
00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:19.190
<v Speaker 1>It's a huge change and it seems</v>
<v Speaker 1>permanent.</v>

70
00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.580
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you see,</v>

71
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.820
<v Speaker 1>even though the big five was developed</v>
<v Speaker 1>statistically,</v>

72
00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.310
<v Speaker 1>that the details are being filled in</v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly from a structural and a</v>

73
00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.570
<v Speaker 1>pharmacological perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But conscientiousness is a tough one.</v>

74
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.400
<v Speaker 1>And it's also partly because our animal</v>
<v Speaker 1>models of conscientiousness are not well</v>

75
00:04:40.401 --> 00:04:42.980
<v Speaker 1>developed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

76
00:04:42.981 --> 00:04:46.430
<v Speaker 1>you could make a case in some sense that</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings are the only creatures that</v>

77
00:04:46.431 --> 00:04:51.431
<v Speaker 1>work in that we'll forego pleasures in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the moment for increased security and</v>

78
00:04:53.961 --> 00:04:58.490
<v Speaker 1>opportunity in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that and since conscientiousness</v>

79
00:04:58.491 --> 00:05:02.120
<v Speaker 1>seems to be integrity tied up with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it also seems to indicate that it's a</v>

80
00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.000
<v Speaker 1>like a fairly high order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional,</v>

81
00:05:05.001 --> 00:05:07.160
<v Speaker 1>motivational cognitive attribute.</v>

82
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.960
<v Speaker 2>Here's a problem.</v>

83
00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:19.030
<v Speaker 1>The classic neuropsychological</v>
<v Speaker 1>story I suppose is that the dorsal</v>

84
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.160
<v Speaker 1>lateral prefrontal Cortex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the part of the cortex that's</v>

85
00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.180
<v Speaker 1>expanded particularly rapidly among</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings,</v>

86
00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:32.990
<v Speaker 1>is associated with planning and abstract</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>

87
00:05:32.991 --> 00:05:34.700
<v Speaker 1>And there seems to be very little doubt</v>
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>

88
00:05:34.701 --> 00:05:37.640
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the correlation between Dorsolateral</v>

89
00:05:37.641 --> 00:05:40.460
<v Speaker 1>prefrontal function,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is basically the cognitive</v>

90
00:05:40.461 --> 00:05:43.100
<v Speaker 1>functions are very much akin to fluid</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>

91
00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.090
<v Speaker 1>The correlation between Dorsolateral</v>
<v Speaker 1>prefrontal function and</v>

92
00:05:47.091 --> 00:05:50.870
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness is basically zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

93
00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.030
<v Speaker 1>and I believe the reason for that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that</v>

94
00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.070
<v Speaker 1>the ability to abstract task,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that conscientiousness has</v>

95
00:05:58.071 --> 00:06:01.910
<v Speaker 1>something to do with implementation of</v>
<v Speaker 1>abstraction into behavior.</v>

96
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:07.430
<v Speaker 1>Whereas abstraction requires that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>remove the obstruction from the behavior</v>

97
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
<v Speaker 1>and</v>
<v Speaker 1>run simulations on the abstraction in in</v>

98
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:18.490
<v Speaker 1>an imagine it in a space of imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that you can investigate the</v>

99
00:06:19.071 --> 00:06:22.850
<v Speaker 1>consequences of different courses of</v>
<v Speaker 1>action in the absence of acting them</v>

100
00:06:22.851 --> 00:06:27.080
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's quite interesting that despite the</v>

101
00:06:27.081 --> 00:06:30.080
<v Speaker 1>fact that it's a neuropsychological</v>
<v Speaker 1>truism,</v>

102
00:06:30.081 --> 00:06:33.470
<v Speaker 1>that the prefrontal cortex is involved</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the inhibition of behavior and the</v>

103
00:06:33.471 --> 00:06:37.970
<v Speaker 1>control of behavior from a statistical</v>
<v Speaker 1>point of view or psychometric point of</v>

104
00:06:37.971 --> 00:06:39.650
<v Speaker 1>view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't seem to be the case at all.</v>

105
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:45.320
<v Speaker 1>I think actually what happens is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex can</v>

106
00:06:45.321 --> 00:06:50.321
<v Speaker 1>help you organize nicely arranged</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchical goal structures and that</v>

107
00:06:51.441 --> 00:06:54.890
<v Speaker 1>those can regulate your behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean that there's any</v>

108
00:06:54.891 --> 00:06:59.180
<v Speaker 1>direct relationship between</v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitive function and behavioral</v>

109
00:06:59.181 --> 00:07:04.181
<v Speaker 1>regulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conscientiousness is being defined by</v>

110
00:07:05.781 --> 00:07:09.650
<v Speaker 1>Roberts as the tendency to be planful</v>
<v Speaker 1>organized task and goal oriented and</v>

111
00:07:09.651 --> 00:07:12.470
<v Speaker 1>self controlled it to delay</v>
<v Speaker 1>gratification and follow norms and</v>

112
00:07:12.471 --> 00:07:15.890
<v Speaker 1>rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like a cognitive attribute.</v>

113
00:07:15.891 --> 00:07:20.240
<v Speaker 1>You know so much of that planful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>organized,</v>

114
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:23.180
<v Speaker 1>goal-oriented,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all sounds like higher cognitive</v>

115
00:07:23.181 --> 00:07:24.014
<v Speaker 1>function,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

116
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:27.020
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't seem to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to be,</v>

117
00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:29.840
<v Speaker 1>it seems to be associated with something</v>
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

118
00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:35.260
<v Speaker 1>That's a big mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now here's some consequences of</v>

119
00:07:35.871 --> 00:07:36.800
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness.</v>

120
00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.970
<v Speaker 1>It's strongly related to life</v>
<v Speaker 1>satisfaction and happiness.</v>

121
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:47.500
<v Speaker 1>There's a number of studies that show</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and the reason seems to be I</v>

122
00:07:47.501 --> 00:07:52.501
<v Speaker 1>suspect is that if you're a</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientious person and so you run your</v>

123
00:07:52.901 --> 00:07:57.700
<v Speaker 1>conscientious life across time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you build a rather orderly and</v>

124
00:07:57.701 --> 00:08:02.701
<v Speaker 1>predictable and stable environment</v>
<v Speaker 1>around you in multiple ways and one of</v>

125
00:08:03.431 --> 00:08:05.710
<v Speaker 1>the ways to not be anxious is</v>

126
00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:12.150
<v Speaker 1>to be low in trait neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but another way to not be anxious is not</v>

127
00:08:12.151 --> 00:08:17.151
<v Speaker 1>to have anything to be anxious about and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know perfectly well from your own</v>

128
00:08:17.281 --> 00:08:21.660
<v Speaker 1>experience that if you adopt an</v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscientious attitude to a task that</v>

129
00:08:21.661 --> 00:08:24.000
<v Speaker 1>you've sent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you've set for yourself,</v>

130
00:08:24.001 --> 00:08:27.270
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience negative emotion as a</v>

131
00:08:27.271 --> 00:08:32.130
<v Speaker 1>consequence of that is very high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be as the deadline approaches</v>

132
00:08:32.131 --> 00:08:37.131
<v Speaker 1>and you haven't done what you had</v>
<v Speaker 1>contracted with yourself to do or maybe</v>

133
00:08:37.591 --> 00:08:39.810
<v Speaker 1>if you're particularly resistant to</v>
<v Speaker 1>negative emotion,</v>

134
00:08:39.811 --> 00:08:43.890
<v Speaker 1>maybe the negative emotion only kicks in</v>
<v Speaker 1>afterwards when as a consequence of</v>

135
00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:46.380
<v Speaker 1>failing to do what you said you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to do,</v>

136
00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:50.640
<v Speaker 1>you fail at the task,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but either way the consequences come</v>

137
00:08:50.641 --> 00:08:51.474
<v Speaker 1>rolling in.</v>

138
00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:02.200
<v Speaker 1>An interesting study by Faye Yard in</v>
<v Speaker 1>2012 showed that conscientiousness was</v>

139
00:09:03.571 --> 00:09:07.230
<v Speaker 1>associated with specific emotions and</v>
<v Speaker 1>overall negative emotion,</v>

140
00:09:07.231 --> 00:09:09.900
<v Speaker 1>but was most strongly associated with</v>
<v Speaker 1>guilt.</v>

141
00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:13.680
<v Speaker 1>So within this situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guilt actually turns out to be a good</v>

142
00:09:13.681 --> 00:09:17.580
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conscientiousness was negatively related</v>

143
00:09:17.581 --> 00:09:21.270
<v Speaker 1>to guilt experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but positively related to guilt</v>

144
00:09:21.271 --> 00:09:24.120
<v Speaker 1>proneness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's kind of interesting because</v>

145
00:09:24.121 --> 00:09:29.121
<v Speaker 1>what it suggests is that if you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you use your guilt to guide you such</v>

146
00:09:30.811 --> 00:09:33.750
<v Speaker 1>that you stopped doing things that make</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guilty,</v>

147
00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:37.740
<v Speaker 1>you're less likely to feel guilt as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of doing something wrong</v>

148
00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:40.050
<v Speaker 1>because you're won't be doing something</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

149
00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:45.540
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so conscientious miss seems to be</v>

150
00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:48.090
<v Speaker 1>hovering around the guilt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shame,</v>

151
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:51.450
<v Speaker 1>disgust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nexis in some way that we haven't really</v>

152
00:09:51.451 --> 00:09:52.350
<v Speaker 1>sorted out yet</v>

153
00:09:56.370 --> 00:10:01.370
<v Speaker 1>since dividing conscientiousness up</v>
<v Speaker 1>until orderliness and industriousness,</v>

154
00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:07.910
<v Speaker 1>we've started to understand somewhat</v>
<v Speaker 1>more clearly the temperamental basis of</v>

155
00:10:08.761 --> 00:10:13.761
<v Speaker 1>political preference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conservatives tend to be ordered like,</v>

156
00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:17.550
<v Speaker 1>and low and openness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now orderly people,</v>

157
00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:20.310
<v Speaker 1>well they make good roommates unless</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

158
00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:21.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've got to the point where they're</v>

159
00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:24.090
<v Speaker 1>completely obsessive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

160
00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:26.040
<v Speaker 1>cause everything trails off into</v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe.</v>

161
00:10:26.041 --> 00:10:30.000
<v Speaker 1>If you push any trait too far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a cliff over which you'll fall</v>

162
00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:32.610
<v Speaker 1>orderly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People seem to be good at process</v>

163
00:10:32.611 --> 00:10:33.690
<v Speaker 1>management.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

164
00:10:33.691 --> 00:10:35.670
<v Speaker 1>they make sure that everything is</v>
<v Speaker 1>sequenced properly,</v>

165
00:10:35.671 --> 00:10:38.370
<v Speaker 1>that it runs properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can understand that in many</v>

166
00:10:38.371 --> 00:10:41.700
<v Speaker 1>situations that's going to be an</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly useful trade.</v>

167
00:10:41.701 --> 00:10:46.701
<v Speaker 1>It's useful in scientific endeavor</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you're doing data with</v>

168
00:10:46.741 --> 00:10:47.910
<v Speaker 1>spreadsheets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>full of numbers,</v>

169
00:10:47.911 --> 00:10:51.210
<v Speaker 1>if you transpose one row,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're done right?</v>

170
00:10:51.211 --> 00:10:53.880
<v Speaker 1>That's the end of the study.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't make one mistake in a</v>

171
00:10:53.881 --> 00:10:55.650
<v Speaker 1>spreadsheet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to be perfect,</v>

172
00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:58.860
<v Speaker 1>especially when you can make</v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophic mistakes with computers,</v>

173
00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:00.240
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they're very,</v>

174
00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:04.080
<v Speaker 1>very good at making major mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to be very orderly to be a</v>

175
00:11:04.081 --> 00:11:05.440
<v Speaker 1>scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

176
00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:10.390
<v Speaker 1>industriousness seems to be a better</v>
<v Speaker 1>predictor of</v>

177
00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:17.130
<v Speaker 1>phenomena like grade point average,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but orderliness still has its place in</v>

178
00:11:18.791 --> 00:11:21.670
<v Speaker 1>assuring that complex procedures are</v>
<v Speaker 1>carried out properly.</v>

179
00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:26.770
<v Speaker 1>Orderly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People also seem to be more discussed</v>

180
00:11:26.771 --> 00:11:29.110
<v Speaker 1>and sensitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a preference for order and</v>

181
00:11:29.111 --> 00:11:31.000
<v Speaker 1>tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're not particularly</v>

182
00:11:31.001 --> 00:11:33.160
<v Speaker 1>egalitarian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're,</v>

183
00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:37.090
<v Speaker 1>they're hierarchical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that's because hierarchies are</v>

184
00:11:37.091 --> 00:11:38.410
<v Speaker 1>more efficient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

185
00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:42.550
<v Speaker 1>the problem with egalitarian</v>
<v Speaker 1>organizations is that</v>

186
00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:48.130
<v Speaker 1>they can't organize themselves along any</v>
<v Speaker 1>access.</v>

187
00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:50.290
<v Speaker 1>So you saw that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

188
00:11:50.291 --> 00:11:53.530
<v Speaker 1>with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do they call those people in York,</v>

189
00:11:53.531 --> 00:11:58.531
<v Speaker 1>in central park after the 2008 crash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was it occupy?</v>

190
00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:04.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was a chaotic demonstration</v>

191
00:12:04.811 --> 00:12:07.120
<v Speaker 1>and no doubt there was something to</v>
<v Speaker 1>demonstrate against,</v>

192
00:12:07.121 --> 00:12:12.121
<v Speaker 1>but the egalitarian left wingers who</v>
<v Speaker 1>were running the organization couldn't</v>

193
00:12:12.161 --> 00:12:14.260
<v Speaker 1>figure out what they wanted or what to</v>
<v Speaker 1>say.</v>

194
00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:18.370
<v Speaker 1>So that's a problem from a political</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective to some degree,</v>

195
00:12:18.371 --> 00:12:21.520
<v Speaker 1>because it means the right wing is going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have an advantage over the left wing</v>

196
00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:24.730
<v Speaker 1>on almost a permanent basis because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be better at</v>

197
00:12:24.731 --> 00:12:28.300
<v Speaker 1>organizing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they left wing is more open,</v>

198
00:12:28.301 --> 00:12:31.180
<v Speaker 1>so they're going to be more creative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So hopefully that's enough of an edge to</v>

199
00:12:31.181 --> 00:12:34.630
<v Speaker 1>keep the two sides properly balanced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Orderly.</v>

200
00:12:34.631 --> 00:12:38.140
<v Speaker 1>People also make harsh judgments of</v>
<v Speaker 1>moral transgression.</v>

201
00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:41.290
<v Speaker 1>I think that probably goes along with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hierarchy,</v>

202
00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.390
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think for orderly people,</v>

203
00:12:43.391 --> 00:12:47.500
<v Speaker 1>there's a pretty steep hierarchy of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of good versus bad or,</v>

204
00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:52.480
<v Speaker 1>or maybe good versus evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that each of the tiers in that</v>

205
00:12:52.481 --> 00:12:55.870
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy or clearly demarcated and</v>
<v Speaker 1>their demarcated morally,</v>

206
00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:57.730
<v Speaker 1>it's better to be at the top.</v>

207
00:12:58.270 --> 00:12:59.103
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

208
00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:03.330
<v Speaker 1>and it's worse to be at the bottom dock</v>
<v Speaker 1>near Calc,</v>

209
00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:05.090
<v Speaker 1>calc Keltner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

210
00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:07.230
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't pronounce his name properly.</v>

211
00:13:07.231 --> 00:13:12.231
<v Speaker 1>At the moment has andy and Jonathan</v>
<v Speaker 1>Haidt if talked about the moralization</v>

212
00:13:12.751 --> 00:13:16.080
<v Speaker 1>of purity and they believe that</v>

213
00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:23.720
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that distinguishes</v>
<v Speaker 1>the top of an orderly hierarchy from the</v>

214
00:13:23.941 --> 00:13:28.920
<v Speaker 1>bottom of an orderly hierarchy is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people at the top who are following</v>

215
00:13:28.921 --> 00:13:33.150
<v Speaker 1>the rules fall into the metaphorical</v>
<v Speaker 1>category of pure</v>

216
00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:37.620
<v Speaker 1>and the people at the bottom who aren't</v>
<v Speaker 1>following the rules fall into the</v>

217
00:13:37.621 --> 00:13:42.621
<v Speaker 1>metaphorical category of the impure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can also see to some degree if</v>

218
00:13:43.771 --> 00:13:47.220
<v Speaker 1>you use your imagination a bit how</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's mapped onto dietary preferences,</v>

219
00:13:47.221 --> 00:13:52.221
<v Speaker 1>especially in religious systems because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are pure foods and pure ways of</v>

220
00:13:52.291 --> 00:13:56.790
<v Speaker 1>preparing food is an impure foods and</v>
<v Speaker 1>impure ways of preparing foods.</v>

221
00:13:57.450 --> 00:14:02.010
<v Speaker 1>And you also see the same thing emerge</v>
<v Speaker 1>in modern political western political</v>

222
00:14:02.011 --> 00:14:07.011
<v Speaker 1>discourse where people spontaneously</v>
<v Speaker 1>organize themselves into groups of</v>

223
00:14:07.021 --> 00:14:10.710
<v Speaker 1>different self proclaimed morality based</v>
<v Speaker 1>on what they choose to eat.</v>

224
00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:14.490
<v Speaker 1>It looks like it's something very deeply</v>
<v Speaker 1>rooted inside people.</v>

225
00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:20.300
<v Speaker 1>I think it's probably also potentially</v>
<v Speaker 1>also associated with the fact that at</v>

226
00:14:20.641 --> 00:14:25.110
<v Speaker 1>least since we've had agriculture and</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonably large settlements,</v>

227
00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:27.010
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

228
00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:31.030
<v Speaker 1>we had to be pretty orderly with regards</v>
<v Speaker 1>to our agricultural store houses because</v>

229
00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:33.610
<v Speaker 1>if you're not orderly when you store</v>
<v Speaker 1>food,</v>

230
00:14:33.611 --> 00:14:38.590
<v Speaker 1>then rats and insects eat all of it or</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets moldy if it's damp and then it</v>

231
00:14:38.591 --> 00:14:40.860
<v Speaker 1>gets rotten and then you can't eat it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you starve to death.</v>

232
00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:42.820
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a good outcome.</v>

233
00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:48.750
<v Speaker 1>So I think there's a number of factors</v>
<v Speaker 1>that have congregated together to align</v>

234
00:14:49.001 --> 00:14:54.001
<v Speaker 1>that disgust sensitivity system and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>orderliness system and the system of</v>

235
00:14:54.351 --> 00:14:59.351
<v Speaker 1>harsh judgment and the ideas of purity</v>
<v Speaker 1>and impurity to bring them all into one</v>

236
00:14:59.811 --> 00:15:00.800
<v Speaker 1>form of alignment.</v>

237
00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:08.600
<v Speaker 1>We wrote a paper a while back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which hasn't been published yet.</v>

238
00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:11.930
<v Speaker 1>Jacob Hersch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's the first author on this paper</v>

239
00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:15.800
<v Speaker 1>entitled it conservatism as a social</v>
<v Speaker 1>immune system.</v>

240
00:15:15.801 --> 00:15:18.560
<v Speaker 1>And I'm going to read you a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the intro from this paper.</v>

241
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.690
<v Speaker 1>Disgust is considered to be one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>basic human emotions defined by a strong</v>

242
00:15:23.691 --> 00:15:27.500
<v Speaker 1>revulsion and desire to withdraw from an</v>
<v Speaker 1>eliciting stimulus or event.</v>

243
00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:32.860
<v Speaker 1>It's a very embodied emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's anxiety,</v>

244
00:15:33.981 --> 00:15:36.950
<v Speaker 1>makes an excitement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes your heart race well,</v>

245
00:15:36.951 --> 00:15:39.650
<v Speaker 1>that's one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but disgust makes your stomach churn,</v>

246
00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:42.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's associated with vomiting and,</v>

247
00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:45.100
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

248
00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:47.600
<v Speaker 1>and tremendous aversion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also very,</v>

249
00:15:47.601 --> 00:15:51.350
<v Speaker 1>very unpleasant emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be the most unpleasant emotion.</v>

250
00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:56.570
<v Speaker 1>It's hard for modern people to judge</v>
<v Speaker 1>that because our societies are so well</v>

251
00:15:56.571 --> 00:16:00.050
<v Speaker 1>organized that we almost never come into</v>
<v Speaker 1>contact with anything that's disgusting.</v>

252
00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:01.670
<v Speaker 1>It's all put away.</v>

253
00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:04.310
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can understand why,</v>

254
00:16:04.311 --> 00:16:09.311
<v Speaker 1>because many things that are disgusting</v>
<v Speaker 1>are actually contaminated and produce</v>

255
00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:11.870
<v Speaker 1>pathology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their illness generators.</v>

256
00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:16.520
<v Speaker 1>So it's not an arbitrary judgment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Physically disgust is accompanied by a</v>

257
00:16:16.521 --> 00:16:20.180
<v Speaker 1>distinct facial expression involving</v>
<v Speaker 1>constriction of the oral and nasal</v>

258
00:16:20.181 --> 00:16:23.090
<v Speaker 1>cavities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember when we watched the crumb</v>

259
00:16:23.091 --> 00:16:25.730
<v Speaker 1>video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that the chrome</v>

260
00:16:25.731 --> 00:16:29.580
<v Speaker 1>brothers typically got from women that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were trying to approach was a</v>

261
00:16:29.581 --> 00:16:33.980
<v Speaker 1>disgust facial expression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that seems to be associated with the</v>

262
00:16:33.981 --> 00:16:37.970
<v Speaker 1>idea of lowly status and contamination</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the desire to,</v>

263
00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:41.480
<v Speaker 1>to close yourself off from the offending</v>
<v Speaker 1>source.</v>

264
00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:45.860
<v Speaker 1>Evolutionary models of disgust proposed</v>
<v Speaker 1>at this emotion evolved to help us avoid</v>

265
00:16:45.861 --> 00:16:50.060
<v Speaker 1>contaminated or harmful foods or other</v>
<v Speaker 1>potential sources of disease such as</v>

266
00:16:50.061 --> 00:16:53.050
<v Speaker 1>sexual contact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

267
00:16:53.051 --> 00:16:57.230
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know that if you arrange creatures in</v>

268
00:16:57.231 --> 00:17:01.820
<v Speaker 1>a dominance hierarchy and then you run a</v>
<v Speaker 1>pat a pathogen through the population</v>

269
00:17:01.821 --> 00:17:05.960
<v Speaker 1>and infectious disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the population tends to die from</v>

270
00:17:05.961 --> 00:17:09.350
<v Speaker 1>the bottom up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means that the animals or people</v>

271
00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:12.260
<v Speaker 1>at the bottom of the dominance hierarchy</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are chronically more stressed are</v>

272
00:17:12.261 --> 00:17:15.830
<v Speaker 1>much more likely to be carriers of</v>
<v Speaker 1>infectious agents and much more likely</v>

273
00:17:15.831 --> 00:17:16.670
<v Speaker 1>to die from that.</v>

274
00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:19.220
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the stats are for</v>

275
00:17:19.221 --> 00:17:21.290
<v Speaker 1>sexually transmitted diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

276
00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:25.430
<v Speaker 1>I should've looked that up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would suspect that the same thing</v>

277
00:17:25.431 --> 00:17:28.460
<v Speaker 1>probably applies there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That as you construct it,</v>

278
00:17:28.461 --> 00:17:32.630
<v Speaker 1>socioeconomic hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability of trends of acquiring</v>

279
00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:36.830
<v Speaker 1>sexually transmitted disease decreases</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you move up the hierarchy</v>

280
00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:43.650
<v Speaker 1>in addition to its role in directly</v>
<v Speaker 1>helping to expel harmful foods from the</v>

281
00:17:44.081 --> 00:17:47.350
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Disgust also forms an important</v>

282
00:17:47.351 --> 00:17:51.570
<v Speaker 1>component of the behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me UN the suite of psychological</v>

283
00:17:51.571 --> 00:17:55.770
<v Speaker 1>mechanisms that aid in the detection and</v>
<v Speaker 1>avoidance of potential contaminants</v>

284
00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:58.140
<v Speaker 1>before they can make contact with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>

285
00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:00.240
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

286
00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:03.240
<v Speaker 1>The other thing that we should never</v>
<v Speaker 1>forget is that the reason we can all say</v>

287
00:18:03.241 --> 00:18:06.540
<v Speaker 1>it here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so clean and well put together,</v>

288
00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:12.530
<v Speaker 1>it's fundamentally because the plumber's</v>
<v Speaker 1>produced to transformation and western</v>

289
00:18:13.771 --> 00:18:16.590
<v Speaker 1>North American and Western society a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred years ago,</v>

290
00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:21.810
<v Speaker 1>and by getting rid of all of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>contaminants that were associated with</v>

291
00:18:21.811 --> 00:18:25.020
<v Speaker 1>poor plumbing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we cranked our life expectancy up</v>

292
00:18:25.021 --> 00:18:30.021
<v Speaker 1>tremendously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's another example of the actual</v>

293
00:18:30.301 --> 00:18:33.840
<v Speaker 1>relationship between sensitivity to</v>
<v Speaker 1>discussed and longevity.</v>

294
00:18:33.841 --> 00:18:38.820
<v Speaker 1>We also know that conscientious people</v>
<v Speaker 1>have better standards of hygiene than</v>

295
00:18:38.821 --> 00:18:41.160
<v Speaker 1>unconscientious people and they do live</v>
<v Speaker 1>longer.</v>

296
00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:45.970
<v Speaker 1>Discussed may have its origins in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>protection against physical</v>

297
00:18:45.971 --> 00:18:48.010
<v Speaker 1>contamination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A number of studies have implicated</v>

298
00:18:48.011 --> 00:18:50.120
<v Speaker 1>disgust responses in moral decision</v>
<v Speaker 1>making,</v>

299
00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:53.460
<v Speaker 1>inducing disgust responses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether via a follow order,</v>

300
00:18:53.461 --> 00:18:57.430
<v Speaker 1>at disgusting work environment or</v>
<v Speaker 1>recalling a disgusting experience led</v>

301
00:18:57.431 --> 00:19:01.450
<v Speaker 1>individuals to assign harsher</v>
<v Speaker 1>punishments to others who had committed</v>

302
00:19:01.451 --> 00:19:05.950
<v Speaker 1>moral transgressions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harsher moral judgments could even be</v>

303
00:19:05.951 --> 00:19:07.810
<v Speaker 1>induced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>falling the consumption of a bitter</v>

304
00:19:07.811 --> 00:19:11.710
<v Speaker 1>drink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bitter taste tends to evoke a disgust</v>

305
00:19:11.711 --> 00:19:16.711
<v Speaker 1>response not because all bitter tastes</v>
<v Speaker 1>are poisonous but because most poisonous</v>

306
00:19:19.601 --> 00:19:22.300
<v Speaker 1>tastes are bitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In addition,</v>

307
00:19:22.301 --> 00:19:25.600
<v Speaker 1>the same disgust related facial</v>
<v Speaker 1>expressions or observed in response to</v>

308
00:19:25.601 --> 00:19:28.750
<v Speaker 1>unpleasant tastes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disgusting photographs and receiving</v>

309
00:19:28.751 --> 00:19:30.910
<v Speaker 1>unfair treatment in an economic game.</v>

310
00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:38.880
<v Speaker 1>Concerns about cleanliness and feelings</v>
<v Speaker 1>of disgust have likewise being related</v>

311
00:19:38.881 --> 00:19:41.880
<v Speaker 1>to political attitudes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Situational reminders of the importance</v>

312
00:19:41.881 --> 00:19:45.540
<v Speaker 1>of physical cleanliness such as asking</v>
<v Speaker 1>participants to wipe their hands with</v>

313
00:19:45.541 --> 00:19:50.541
<v Speaker 1>antiseptic wipes tends to increase self</v>
<v Speaker 1>reported political conservatism such a</v>

314
00:19:51.601 --> 00:19:55.980
<v Speaker 1>finding is consistent with the notion</v>
<v Speaker 1>that purity tends to be valued more by</v>

315
00:19:55.981 --> 00:20:00.981
<v Speaker 1>conservatives than by liberals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Individuals who report being disgusted</v>

316
00:20:01.531 --> 00:20:05.250
<v Speaker 1>more easily also tend to hold more</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative political views on topics</v>

317
00:20:05.251 --> 00:20:06.750
<v Speaker 1>including abortion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gay marriage,</v>

318
00:20:06.751 --> 00:20:08.430
<v Speaker 1>tax cuts and affirmative action.</v>

319
00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:13.510
<v Speaker 1>In addition to the effects that have</v>
<v Speaker 1>emerged when using self reported disgust</v>

320
00:20:13.511 --> 00:20:15.580
<v Speaker 1>sensitivity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more conservative political views have</v>

321
00:20:15.581 --> 00:20:19.060
<v Speaker 1>also been associated with stronger</v>
<v Speaker 1>physiological reactivity to disgusting</v>

322
00:20:19.061 --> 00:20:21.670
<v Speaker 1>images.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In particular,</v>

323
00:20:21.671 --> 00:20:24.250
<v Speaker 1>a large literature is converged on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>notion that there are two core</v>

324
00:20:24.251 --> 00:20:28.690
<v Speaker 1>dimensions of conservatism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>resistance to change and tolerance of</v>

325
00:20:28.691 --> 00:20:32.860
<v Speaker 1>inequality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Resistance to change reflects the extent</v>

326
00:20:32.861 --> 00:20:35.260
<v Speaker 1>to which people wish to maintain the</v>
<v Speaker 1>status quo.</v>

327
00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:38.530
<v Speaker 1>While tolerance of inequality reflects</v>
<v Speaker 1>the acceptance of an unequal</v>

328
00:20:38.531 --> 00:20:41.350
<v Speaker 1>distribution of resources and</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunities within the society.</v>

329
00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:42.880
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

330
00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:45.820
<v Speaker 1>we talked about this already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a complicated issue because</v>

331
00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:52.680
<v Speaker 1>if you're absolutely egalitarian nerve</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your orientation,</v>

332
00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:56.520
<v Speaker 1>then you have to make the presumption</v>
<v Speaker 1>that all differences in hierarchical</v>

333
00:20:56.521 --> 00:20:58.440
<v Speaker 1>status are fundamentally unjust,</v>

334
00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:00.920
<v Speaker 2>okay?</v>

335
00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:03.980
<v Speaker 1>If you're absolutely hierarchical in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your orientation,</v>

336
00:21:03.981 --> 00:21:08.120
<v Speaker 1>then you have to make the assumption</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the distribution of resources that</v>

337
00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:12.080
<v Speaker 1>obtains currently is a consequence of</v>
<v Speaker 1>justice,</v>

338
00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:14.630
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people at the top deserve to be</v>

339
00:21:14.631 --> 00:21:16.700
<v Speaker 1>there and the people at the bottom</v>
<v Speaker 1>deserve to be there.</v>

340
00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:18.860
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we've already discussed,</v>

341
00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:23.930
<v Speaker 1>the situation is complicated by the fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there seems to be some truth in</v>

342
00:21:23.931 --> 00:21:28.130
<v Speaker 1>both claims and so far is</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness and intelligence</v>

343
00:21:28.131 --> 00:21:32.510
<v Speaker 1>predict longterm socioeconomic status</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that conscientiousness and</v>

344
00:21:32.511 --> 00:21:36.200
<v Speaker 1>intelligence to seem to be associated</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite strongly with competence.</v>

345
00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:41.300
<v Speaker 1>Then the degree to which they predict</v>
<v Speaker 1>social status seems to indicate that the</v>

346
00:21:41.301 --> 00:21:46.301
<v Speaker 1>structure is just the fact that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>are brought down the dominance hierarchy</v>

347
00:21:46.491 --> 00:21:49.160
<v Speaker 1>for all sorts of reasons that have</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing to do with their intrinsic</v>

348
00:21:49.161 --> 00:21:54.161
<v Speaker 1>competence or or their willingness to</v>
<v Speaker 1>engage in productive activity weakens</v>

349
00:21:54.681 --> 00:21:59.000
<v Speaker 1>the conservative argument because there</v>
<v Speaker 1>are certainly cases where the</v>

350
00:21:59.001 --> 00:22:03.020
<v Speaker 1>distribution of resources can be seen to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be fundamentally unjust.</v>

351
00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:08.390
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the things that happens</v>
<v Speaker 1>with political belief is that you can</v>

352
00:22:08.391 --> 00:22:11.330
<v Speaker 1>think about political beliefs as</v>
<v Speaker 1>heuristics and heuristics are</v>

353
00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:14.900
<v Speaker 1>unconscious rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're really algorithms that people</v>

354
00:22:14.901 --> 00:22:19.340
<v Speaker 1>use to address large sets of data to</v>
<v Speaker 1>simplify them so that they're not,</v>

355
00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:23.360
<v Speaker 1>they're not drowning in complexity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The system is just,</v>

356
00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:24.950
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a simplification.</v>

357
00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:28.130
<v Speaker 1>It means there's all sorts of things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you don't have to think about.</v>

358
00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:33.770
<v Speaker 1>This system is unjust is is it is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>heuristic oversimplification as well and</v>

359
00:22:33.771 --> 00:22:37.160
<v Speaker 1>it means that you don't have to think</v>
<v Speaker 1>your way through the complexities of the</v>

360
00:22:37.161 --> 00:22:40.850
<v Speaker 1>actual topic that you're dealing with</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what seems to be happening is that</v>

361
00:22:40.851 --> 00:22:45.851
<v Speaker 1>the temperamental factors that we've</v>
<v Speaker 1>discussed so to speak reflect the use of</v>

362
00:22:47.211 --> 00:22:50.000
<v Speaker 1>heuristics that are grounded deeply in</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation and emotion.</v>

363
00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:53.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

364
00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:56.290
<v Speaker 1>The two dimensions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>resistance to change and tolerance of</v>

365
00:22:56.291 --> 00:22:59.920
<v Speaker 1>inequality appear roughly aligned with</v>
<v Speaker 1>social and economic conservative</v>

366
00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:03.010
<v Speaker 1>conservatism as expressed in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>constructs of right wing</v>

367
00:23:03.011 --> 00:23:06.550
<v Speaker 1>authoritarianism and social dominance</v>
<v Speaker 1>orientation respectively.</v>

368
00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:11.860
<v Speaker 1>The core facets of conservatism are also</v>
<v Speaker 1>closely related to the two higher order</v>

369
00:23:11.861 --> 00:23:15.490
<v Speaker 1>value dimensions described in moral</v>
<v Speaker 1>foundations theory which reflect</v>

370
00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:18.610
<v Speaker 1>preference for order and tradition on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one hand and preferences for</v>

371
00:23:18.611 --> 00:23:20.110
<v Speaker 1>egalitarianism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other.</v>

372
00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:24.150
<v Speaker 1>Importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the motivational basis of these two</v>

373
00:23:24.151 --> 00:23:27.570
<v Speaker 1>dimensions appears to vary independently</v>
<v Speaker 1>from one another with an individual's</v>

374
00:23:27.571 --> 00:23:29.340
<v Speaker 1>overall political attitudes on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

375
00:23:29.341 --> 00:23:32.040
<v Speaker 1>Left spectrum emerging from the relative</v>
<v Speaker 1>balance.</v>

376
00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:34.140
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

377
00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:37.350
<v Speaker 1>These motives are also strongly rooted</v>
<v Speaker 1>in basic personality characteristics</v>

378
00:23:37.351 --> 00:23:40.980
<v Speaker 1>such that preferences for order and</v>
<v Speaker 1>tradition are associated with higher</v>

379
00:23:40.981 --> 00:23:45.410
<v Speaker 1>levels of orderliness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not industriousness and politeness,</v>

380
00:23:45.411 --> 00:23:49.610
<v Speaker 1>which is an aspect of agreeableness as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well as with lower levels of openness</v>

381
00:23:49.611 --> 00:23:54.380
<v Speaker 1>and intellect and contrast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Preferences for egalitarianism are</v>

382
00:23:54.381 --> 00:23:58.670
<v Speaker 1>uniquely associated with compassion and</v>
<v Speaker 1>aspect of agreeableness.</v>

383
00:24:02.550 --> 00:24:06.330
<v Speaker 1>Political conservatism can be thought of</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a social immune system reflecting the</v>

384
00:24:06.331 --> 00:24:09.690
<v Speaker 1>extension of pathogen avoidance</v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanisms to the integrity of the</v>

385
00:24:09.691 --> 00:24:12.240
<v Speaker 1>social system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea there,</v>

386
00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:15.390
<v Speaker 1>the metaphorical idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

387
00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:18.810
<v Speaker 1>if you're egalitarianism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's a big family.</v>

388
00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:22.100
<v Speaker 1>That's the core metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

389
00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:27.240
<v Speaker 1>I think that's part of the reason that</v>
<v Speaker 1>women are more agreeable than men.</v>

390
00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:32.490
<v Speaker 1>They're are more compassionate than men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's necessary for them to be more</v>

391
00:24:32.491 --> 00:24:37.491
<v Speaker 1>compassionate than men because they have</v>
<v Speaker 1>the obligation or opportunity to concern</v>

392
00:24:39.751 --> 00:24:42.090
<v Speaker 1>themselves with the egalitarian</v>
<v Speaker 1>distributors,</v>

393
00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:44.670
<v Speaker 1>distribution of resources within the</v>
<v Speaker 1>family unit.</v>

394
00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:50.743
<v Speaker 2>If you're</v>

395
00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:57.860
<v Speaker 1>orderly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental metaphor,</v>

396
00:24:57.861 --> 00:25:00.760
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't seem to be family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fundamental,</v>

397
00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:05.820
<v Speaker 1>fundamental metaphor seems to be body</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the purity of the body and so,</v>

398
00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:11.290
<v Speaker 1>and the vulnerability of the body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another element of it.</v>

399
00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:15.430
<v Speaker 1>Just as the behavioral immune system is</v>
<v Speaker 1>being conceptualized as helping to</v>

400
00:25:15.431 --> 00:25:17.710
<v Speaker 1>maintain the purity integrity of an</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual body,</v>

401
00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:21.910
<v Speaker 1>so to may the same pathogen avoidance</v>
<v Speaker 1>system help to maintain the abstract</v>

402
00:25:21.911 --> 00:25:26.911
<v Speaker 1>integrity of the social order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't call our society a body of laws</v>

403
00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:31.120
<v Speaker 1>for nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We also tend to symbolize countries as</v>

404
00:25:31.121 --> 00:25:33.070
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

405
00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:38.450
<v Speaker 1>you can say things like England took</v>
<v Speaker 1>steps to,</v>

406
00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:44.140
<v Speaker 1>or France recently decided to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so there's the idea that each state</v>

407
00:25:45.381 --> 00:25:49.400
<v Speaker 1>can be represented as a body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could also say that a hereditary</v>

408
00:25:49.401 --> 00:25:54.401
<v Speaker 1>monarch like Queen Elizabeth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's such a powerful figure because she</v>

409
00:25:55.521 --> 00:26:00.320
<v Speaker 1>embodies in her actual being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the concept of the state.</v>

410
00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:06.740
<v Speaker 1>The state is a body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually a body of laws,</v>

411
00:26:06.741 --> 00:26:10.220
<v Speaker 1>and in so far as you are bound by that</v>
<v Speaker 1>body of laws,</v>

412
00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:15.460
<v Speaker 1>you're all acting out the same body</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're mimicking the same set of</v>

413
00:26:15.891 --> 00:26:19.220
<v Speaker 1>principles that describe the way that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you orient your behavior and your</v>

414
00:26:19.221 --> 00:26:21.290
<v Speaker 1>perception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these are,</v>

415
00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:24.830
<v Speaker 1>these are archetipal metaphors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of thinking about it.</v>

416
00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:28.130
<v Speaker 1>And they have consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The social immune system would help to</v>

417
00:26:28.131 --> 00:26:31.910
<v Speaker 1>maintain order by suppressing any</v>
<v Speaker 1>actions or individuals that deviate from</v>

418
00:26:31.911 --> 00:26:34.160
<v Speaker 1>a group's accepted social traditions.</v>

419
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.070
<v Speaker 1>If you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if</v>

420
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:49.070
<v Speaker 2>the cells in your body deviated enough</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the traditions of the other cells,</v>

421
00:26:49.081 --> 00:26:53.490
<v Speaker 2>then what you develop is cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's this idea,</v>

422
00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:54.481
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

423
00:26:54.481 --> 00:26:56.340
<v Speaker 2>it's not only an idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this,</v>

424
00:26:57.030 --> 00:27:01.500
<v Speaker 2>there's this fundamental reality that a</v>
<v Speaker 2>certain amount of</v>

425
00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:08.710
<v Speaker 1>stability and safety is to be held in</v>
<v Speaker 1>obedience to,</v>

426
00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:10.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

427
00:27:10.311 --> 00:27:11.540
<v Speaker 1>structure of authority.</v>

428
00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:20.170
<v Speaker 1>It has been reported that regions with</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher levels of disease prevalence tend</v>

429
00:27:20.171 --> 00:27:23.920
<v Speaker 1>to be associated with higher levels of</v>
<v Speaker 1>social conformity and autocratic rule.</v>

430
00:27:24.550 --> 00:27:28.370
<v Speaker 1>Individuals who feel more vulnerable to</v>
<v Speaker 1>disease likewise report higher levels of</v>

431
00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:30.330
<v Speaker 1>ethnocentrism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>xenophobia.</v>

432
00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:34.420
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things we do know about</v>
<v Speaker 1>socioeconomic status is that people who</v>

433
00:27:34.421 --> 00:27:38.440
<v Speaker 1>are lower on the socioeconomic hierarchy</v>
<v Speaker 1>or more disgust sensitive.</v>

434
00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:42.130
<v Speaker 1>Now the reasons for that or to exactly</v>
<v Speaker 1>clear,</v>

435
00:27:42.131 --> 00:27:46.210
<v Speaker 1>because people on the lower end of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>socioeconomic distribution on average</v>

436
00:27:46.211 --> 00:27:51.211
<v Speaker 1>also tend to have lower iqs and lower</v>
<v Speaker 1>iqs are associated with increased</v>

437
00:27:52.121 --> 00:27:56.020
<v Speaker 1>disgust sensitivity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's the confounding effect of</v>

438
00:27:56.021 --> 00:27:59.140
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But by the same token,</v>

439
00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:01.820
<v Speaker 1>if you're at the bottom of the dominance</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>

440
00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:04.780
<v Speaker 1>you are more prone to infectious disease</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're,</v>

441
00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:09.220
<v Speaker 1>you're stressed and vulnerable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's real,</v>

442
00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:13.000
<v Speaker 1>there's real reasons for you to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>careful about what you expose yourself</v>

443
00:28:13.001 --> 00:28:17.680
<v Speaker 1>to if you're just clinging on to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom of the hierarchy with both hands</v>

444
00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:19.090
<v Speaker 1>or with one hand.</v>

445
00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:21.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

446
00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:23.730
<v Speaker 1>so it's basic concerns about pathogen</v>
<v Speaker 1>avoidance.</v>

447
00:28:23.731 --> 00:28:27.300
<v Speaker 1>Me That's contributed to the desire for</v>
<v Speaker 1>order and tradition among conservatives</v>

448
00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:31.530
<v Speaker 1>along with the harsh moral judgements</v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with violations of the social</v>

449
00:28:31.531 --> 00:28:32.364
<v Speaker 1>order.</v>

450
00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:36.770
<v Speaker 1>Because one of the things that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not easy to understand,</v>

451
00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:39.440
<v Speaker 1>it's like you see this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see this a lot in the United States</v>

452
00:28:39.441 --> 00:28:44.441
<v Speaker 1>where the attraction of Republican</v>
<v Speaker 1>politics isn't limited to those at the</v>

453
00:28:45.741 --> 00:28:48.620
<v Speaker 1>top of the socioeconomic ladder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

454
00:28:48.621 --> 00:28:52.850
<v Speaker 1>the Republicans draw tremendous support</v>
<v Speaker 1>from people who were in the lower strata</v>

455
00:28:52.851 --> 00:28:57.680
<v Speaker 1>of the socioeconomic hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though it seems quite clear by some</v>

456
00:28:57.681 --> 00:29:02.681
<v Speaker 1>standards that the policies that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Republican's promote are not policies</v>

457
00:29:03.051 --> 00:29:07.660
<v Speaker 1>that are going to help people who are at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bottom of the socioeconomics</v>

458
00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:12.590
<v Speaker 1>distribution if they stay there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you could argue that the reason that</v>

459
00:29:12.591 --> 00:29:16.460
<v Speaker 1>the poor republican support the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Republicans is because they see</v>

460
00:29:16.461 --> 00:29:20.420
<v Speaker 1>themselves as able to climb the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy and so they're voting their</v>

461
00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:24.350
<v Speaker 1>dream and north the reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you could also make a case.</v>

462
00:29:24.351 --> 00:29:28.000
<v Speaker 1>I believe that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people at the bottom of the</v>

463
00:29:28.001 --> 00:29:31.240
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy are already so stressed that</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you add more variability into the</v>

464
00:29:31.241 --> 00:29:35.380
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that increases the probability that</v>

465
00:29:35.381 --> 00:29:39.670
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>overwhelmed by chaos and the more</v>

466
00:29:39.671 --> 00:29:42.550
<v Speaker 1>stressed they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more the higher the probability that</v>

467
00:29:42.551 --> 00:29:45.940
<v Speaker 1>they're going to suffer ill health for</v>
<v Speaker 1>one reason or another.</v>

468
00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:50.650
<v Speaker 1>So perhaps part of the reason for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>desire to maintain social integrity,</v>

469
00:29:50.651 --> 00:29:51.940
<v Speaker 1>even if you're at the bottom of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>heap,</v>

470
00:29:51.941 --> 00:29:55.900
<v Speaker 1>is because some orders better than none,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're already stressed to</v>

471
00:29:55.901 --> 00:29:56.734
<v Speaker 1>your limit.</v>

472
00:29:58.850 --> 00:30:02.030
<v Speaker 1>Severe moral judgment may be a key</v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanism by which the social immune</v>

473
00:30:02.031 --> 00:30:06.230
<v Speaker 1>system instantiated and conservative</v>
<v Speaker 1>practices and policies aims to eliminate</v>

474
00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:10.370
<v Speaker 1>exposure to deviant social elements that</v>
<v Speaker 1>may increase the risk of pathogen</v>

475
00:30:10.371 --> 00:30:13.580
<v Speaker 1>exposure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>According to a parasite stress</v>

476
00:30:13.581 --> 00:30:15.650
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian governments are more</v>

477
00:30:15.651 --> 00:30:18.950
<v Speaker 1>likely to emerge in regions</v>
<v Speaker 1>characterized by a high prevalence of</v>

478
00:30:18.951 --> 00:30:23.420
<v Speaker 1>disease causing pathogens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Recent cross national evidence is</v>

479
00:30:23.421 --> 00:30:26.570
<v Speaker 1>consistent with this hypothesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are inferential limitations</v>

480
00:30:26.571 --> 00:30:29.510
<v Speaker 1>associated with that evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We report to studies that address some</v>

481
00:30:29.511 --> 00:30:32.150
<v Speaker 1>of these limitations and provide further</v>
<v Speaker 1>tests of the hypothesis.</v>

482
00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:35.120
<v Speaker 1>This is the paper I mentioned before</v>
<v Speaker 1>from plause one.</v>

483
00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:39.860
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately I didn't put the title of</v>

484
00:30:39.861 --> 00:30:44.660
<v Speaker 1>it here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you type into Google authoritarianism</v>

485
00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:49.990
<v Speaker 1>and parasite prevalence and you look for</v>
<v Speaker 1>plause one p l o s one,</v>

486
00:30:50.121 --> 00:30:54.050
<v Speaker 1>you'll find it right away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Study one or revealed that parasite</v>

487
00:30:54.051 --> 00:30:58.370
<v Speaker 1>prevalence strongly predicted cross</v>
<v Speaker 1>national differences on measures</v>

488
00:30:58.371 --> 00:31:02.030
<v Speaker 1>assessing individual's authoritarian</v>
<v Speaker 1>personalities and this effect</v>

489
00:31:02.031 --> 00:31:05.650
<v Speaker 1>statistically mediated the relationship</v>
<v Speaker 1>between parasite prevalence and the</v>

490
00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:10.490
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian governance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mediation result is inconsistent</v>

491
00:31:10.491 --> 00:31:13.400
<v Speaker 1>with an alternative explanation for</v>
<v Speaker 1>previous findings</v>

492
00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:19.460
<v Speaker 1>to address further limitations</v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with cross national</v>

493
00:31:19.461 --> 00:31:23.060
<v Speaker 1>comparisons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Study two tested the parasite stress</v>

494
00:31:23.061 --> 00:31:27.950
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis on a sample of traditional</v>
<v Speaker 1>small scale societies.</v>

495
00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:32.630
<v Speaker 1>Revolts re results revealed that</v>
<v Speaker 1>parasite prevalence predicted measures</v>

496
00:31:32.631 --> 00:31:37.010
<v Speaker 1>of authoritarian governance and did so</v>
<v Speaker 1>even when statistically controlling for</v>

497
00:31:37.011 --> 00:31:39.620
<v Speaker 1>other threats to human welfare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One additional threat.</v>

498
00:31:39.621 --> 00:31:43.100
<v Speaker 1>Famine also uniquely predicted</v>
<v Speaker 1>authoritarianism.</v>

499
00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:48.070
<v Speaker 1>Together these results further</v>
<v Speaker 1>substantiate the parasite stress</v>

500
00:31:48.071 --> 00:31:52.480
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis of authoritarianism and</v>
<v Speaker 1>suggested societal differences and</v>

501
00:31:52.481 --> 00:31:56.020
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian governance result in part</v>
<v Speaker 1>from cultural differences in</v>

502
00:31:56.021 --> 00:31:58.360
<v Speaker 1>individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>authoritarians personalities.</v>

503
00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:04.560
<v Speaker 1>So there is a correlation table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the correlation between authoritarian</v>

504
00:32:05.081 --> 00:32:08.080
<v Speaker 1>governance and pathogen prevalence is</v>
<v Speaker 1>0.42.</v>

505
00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:10.453
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

506
00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:15.740
<v Speaker 1>That's higher than the correlation</v>
<v Speaker 1>between Iq and academic performance at</v>

507
00:32:15.741 --> 00:32:20.741
<v Speaker 1>the University of Toronto by quite a</v>
<v Speaker 1>substantial margin 0.42 especially in a</v>

508
00:32:20.871 --> 00:32:23.390
<v Speaker 1>sample of this size because it was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>very large sample.</v>

509
00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:27.740
<v Speaker 1>That's about as big a correlation</v>
<v Speaker 1>coefficient as you're ever going to see</v>

510
00:32:27.741 --> 00:32:31.460
<v Speaker 1>between two two variables,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of which is psychological.</v>

511
00:32:31.610 --> 00:32:32.870
<v Speaker 1>So that would be the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

512
00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:35.930
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian is 12 item index of</v>

513
00:32:35.931 --> 00:32:38.510
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian governance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things to remember,</v>

514
00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:42.290
<v Speaker 1>it's only a item questionnaire that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a very good questionnaire.</v>

515
00:32:42.890 --> 00:32:47.450
<v Speaker 1>So there's a lot of measurement error in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and that actually in a situation</v>

516
00:32:47.451 --> 00:32:51.080
<v Speaker 1>like this that actually means the true</v>
<v Speaker 1>correlation is higher because lack of</v>

517
00:32:51.081 --> 00:32:55.370
<v Speaker 1>reliability is going to like cause if</v>
<v Speaker 1>your measure isn't reliable and isn't</v>

518
00:32:55.371 --> 00:32:58.160
<v Speaker 1>completely valid than some of what it</v>
<v Speaker 1>measures is going to be noise.</v>

519
00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:02.570
<v Speaker 1>And so the true correlation could easily</v>
<v Speaker 1>be 0.5</v>

520
00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:09.680
<v Speaker 1>fam and adds another 0.26</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's quite staggering.</v>

521
00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:16.433
<v Speaker 2>Now</v>

522
00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:25.000
<v Speaker 1>I want to walk you through some</v>
<v Speaker 1>potential consequences of this and some</v>

523
00:33:25.001 --> 00:33:26.920
<v Speaker 1>of this is speculative in some of it</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't.</v>

524
00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:30.610
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I want you to remember</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that</v>

525
00:33:32.170 --> 00:33:36.960
<v Speaker 1>the end of World War One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the biggest flu influenza epidemic and</v>

526
00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:42.260
<v Speaker 1>that was ever recorded in history hit</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it killed four times as many people</v>

527
00:33:42.431 --> 00:33:45.760
<v Speaker 1>as the first world war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

528
00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:49.810
<v Speaker 1>you got to keep that in mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or Germany lost the first world war and</v>

529
00:33:49.811 --> 00:33:54.811
<v Speaker 1>they suffered a harsh reparation burden</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a consequence of the peace treaty</v>

530
00:33:54.971 --> 00:33:59.470
<v Speaker 1>that was signed at Versailles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then during the 1920s</v>

531
00:34:01.330 --> 00:34:06.330
<v Speaker 1>the German economy collapsed completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that people were taking wheelbarrows</v>

532
00:34:06.701 --> 00:34:09.160
<v Speaker 1>full of money to the corner store to buy</v>
<v Speaker 1>bread.</v>

533
00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:11.563
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

534
00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:16.840
<v Speaker 1>you can imagine that those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the war,</v>

535
00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:23.130
<v Speaker 1>the flu and the catastrophic</v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophic inflation set the stage for</v>

536
00:34:25.391 --> 00:34:29.920
<v Speaker 1>German political thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly what happened to the Germans</v>

537
00:34:29.921 --> 00:34:34.921
<v Speaker 1>could be regarded as immensely chaotic</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a society that's collapsed into</v>

538
00:34:39.231 --> 00:34:42.380
<v Speaker 1>chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get an unconscious</v>

539
00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:47.480
<v Speaker 1>or conscious demand for the imposition</v>
<v Speaker 1>of order.</v>

540
00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:51.170
<v Speaker 1>And one thing Hitler was good at was</v>
<v Speaker 1>ordered.</v>

541
00:34:52.130 --> 00:34:54.230
<v Speaker 1>You look at that picture on the left</v>
<v Speaker 1>hand side,</v>

542
00:34:55.190 --> 00:35:00.190
<v Speaker 1>that's tens of thousands of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>all organized into basically perfect</v>

543
00:35:00.971 --> 00:35:04.930
<v Speaker 1>squares.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you remember how the Nazis marched?</v>

544
00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:10.920
<v Speaker 1>They did the goose step and they did an</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely precisely</v>

545
00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:20.050
<v Speaker 1>Hitler was certainly willing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>subordinate the individual freedom of</v>

546
00:35:20.051 --> 00:35:25.051
<v Speaker 1>the Germans that the ariens let's say to</v>
<v Speaker 1>his overall vision and believed in fact</v>

547
00:35:26.531 --> 00:35:29.620
<v Speaker 1>that the individual should be</v>
<v Speaker 1>subordinate to the overall vision.</v>

548
00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:32.200
<v Speaker 1>And he was certainly willing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice</v>

549
00:35:33.730 --> 00:35:36.610
<v Speaker 1>anyone or anything that deviated from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

550
00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:41.430
<v Speaker 1>from inclusion within this pure ordered</v>
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>

551
00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:53.510
<v Speaker 1>So that</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a photograph of the Nuremberg</v>

552
00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:58.890
<v Speaker 1>Nazi party rally grounds</v>
<v Speaker 1>from quite a distance.</v>

553
00:35:59.010 --> 00:36:03.480
<v Speaker 1>The light that you see that's horizontal</v>
<v Speaker 1>across the bottom is the front of the</v>

554
00:36:03.481 --> 00:36:07.160
<v Speaker 1>stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The lights shining upward are the loofah</v>

555
00:36:07.161 --> 00:36:09.750
<v Speaker 1>office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>antiaircraft lights,</v>

556
00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:15.180
<v Speaker 1>all arrayed around the parade ground and</v>
<v Speaker 1>shining straight up.</v>

557
00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:22.340
<v Speaker 1>So use the symbolism of light against</v>
<v Speaker 1>darkness as an adjunct to his political</v>

558
00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:26.610
<v Speaker 1>maneuvering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could see the absolute order that's</v>

559
00:36:26.611 --> 00:36:30.990
<v Speaker 1>portrayed in that massive sculpture of</v>
<v Speaker 1>light.</v>

560
00:36:42.350 --> 00:36:43.183
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

561
00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:46.910
<v Speaker 1>You can see in the top left hand corner</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

562
00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:52.840
<v Speaker 1>the precise precision with with which</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone is lined up.</v>

563
00:36:54.050 --> 00:36:56.420
<v Speaker 1>So they make perfectly geometrical</v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns.</v>

564
00:36:57.110 --> 00:37:01.150
<v Speaker 1>And then on the right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this,</v>

565
00:37:01.151 --> 00:37:05.030
<v Speaker 1>this is a small stadium for a political</v>
<v Speaker 1>gathering compared to what the Nazis</v>

566
00:37:05.031 --> 00:37:08.630
<v Speaker 1>were planning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Albert speer was planning to build a</v>

567
00:37:08.631 --> 00:37:11.780
<v Speaker 1>stadium for such rallies that would have</v>
<v Speaker 1>had 400,000 seats.</v>

568
00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:17.780
<v Speaker 1>So I think the typical football stadium</v>
<v Speaker 1>has about 60,000</v>

569
00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:23.270
<v Speaker 1>so you see on the right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone perfectly aligned,</v>

570
00:37:23.271 --> 00:37:28.271
<v Speaker 1>everyone perfectly uniform and masses</v>
<v Speaker 1>and masses and rows of people all</v>

571
00:37:28.301 --> 00:37:31.460
<v Speaker 1>ordered in precise perfection.</v>

572
00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:46.120
<v Speaker 1>This is a piece of Nazi propaganda from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 1930s this,</v>

573
00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:49.460
<v Speaker 1>the rest of this lecture is going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>very disturbing,</v>

574
00:37:49.970 --> 00:37:53.810
<v Speaker 1>but I want to show you what happened as</v>
<v Speaker 1>far as I can tell.</v>

575
00:37:55.910 --> 00:38:00.530
<v Speaker 1>When Hitler came to power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his fundamental</v>

576
00:38:02.810 --> 00:38:07.810
<v Speaker 1>goal was to purify what he thought of as</v>
<v Speaker 1>the area in body.</v>

577
00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:11.810
<v Speaker 1>And I want to show you how he went about</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing that.</v>

578
00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:17.890
<v Speaker 1>So that's wording from a Nazi propaganda</v>
<v Speaker 1>folder.</v>

579
00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:23.150
<v Speaker 1>The people of the world will recognize</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Jew as world parasite and there will</v>

580
00:38:23.151 --> 00:38:26.960
<v Speaker 1>be a time when there will be one united</v>
<v Speaker 1>front of all people against the Jewish</v>

581
00:38:26.961 --> 00:38:29.900
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>parasite and humanity will be freed from</v>

582
00:38:29.901 --> 00:38:32.990
<v Speaker 1>the most severe illness from which it</v>
<v Speaker 1>suffered for thousands of years.</v>

583
00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:34.730
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason I picked those words</v>

584
00:38:34.750 --> 00:38:39.580
<v Speaker 1>precisely is because you can see the</v>
<v Speaker 1>body metaphor lying underneath that it's</v>

585
00:38:39.581 --> 00:38:40.630
<v Speaker 1>direct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

586
00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:45.750
<v Speaker 1>it's not even subtle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

587
00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:53.040
<v Speaker 1>these are</v>
<v Speaker 1>pieces of Hitler's spontaneous speech</v>

588
00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:57.090
<v Speaker 1>that we're organized from mine comp.</v>

589
00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:03.470
<v Speaker 1>These are all metaphors of disease that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he used in his speeches and writing.</v>

590
00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:09.320
<v Speaker 1>It's from a book by Richard Koenigsberg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>w called embodied metaphor,</v>

591
00:39:09.321 --> 00:39:14.321
<v Speaker 1>fantasy and history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since the state did not possess the</v>

592
00:39:14.631 --> 00:39:18.200
<v Speaker 1>power to master the disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the menacing decay of the Reich was</v>

593
00:39:18.201 --> 00:39:22.250
<v Speaker 1>manifest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The masses feel that the mere fact of</v>

594
00:39:22.251 --> 00:39:24.770
<v Speaker 1>the Jews existences as bad as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>plague.</v>

595
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:29.510
<v Speaker 1>Politicians tinkering around on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>German national body saw it.</v>

596
00:39:29.511 --> 00:39:31.340
<v Speaker 1>Most of the forms of our general</v>
<v Speaker 1>disease,</v>

597
00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:36.020
<v Speaker 1>but blindly ignored the virus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the tail time of the unification,</v>

598
00:39:36.021 --> 00:39:39.770
<v Speaker 1>the inner decay was already in full</v>
<v Speaker 1>swing and the general situation was</v>

599
00:39:39.771 --> 00:39:44.390
<v Speaker 1>deteriorating from year to year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Nation did not grow inwardly</v>

600
00:39:44.391 --> 00:39:47.240
<v Speaker 1>healthier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but obviously languished more and more.</v>

601
00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:51.350
<v Speaker 1>The symptoms of decay of the prewar</v>
<v Speaker 1>period can be reduced to racial causes.</v>

602
00:39:51.650 --> 00:39:56.210
<v Speaker 1>Anybody who wants to cure this era,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was inwardly sick and rotten,</v>

603
00:39:56.690 --> 00:40:00.320
<v Speaker 1>must first of all sum up the courage to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make clear the causes of this disease.</v>

604
00:40:01.610 --> 00:40:04.410
<v Speaker 1>They think that they must demonstrate</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they are ready for appeasement.</v>

605
00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:09.200
<v Speaker 1>That's the English I believe so as to</v>
<v Speaker 1>stay the deadly cancerous all through a</v>

606
00:40:09.530 --> 00:40:14.000
<v Speaker 1>policy of moderation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Jew must take care that the plague</v>

607
00:40:14.001 --> 00:40:17.090
<v Speaker 1>does not die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If this battle should not come,</v>

608
00:40:17.091 --> 00:40:21.080
<v Speaker 1>Germany would decay and it basket sync</v>
<v Speaker 1>to ruin like a rotting corpse.</v>

609
00:40:21.410 --> 00:40:25.520
<v Speaker 1>You can see in the right today an</v>
<v Speaker 1>example of mortal dk.</v>

610
00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:30.710
<v Speaker 1>The 1st of May can only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can be only the liberation of the</v>

611
00:40:30.711 --> 00:40:34.640
<v Speaker 1>nation spirit from the infection of</v>
<v Speaker 1>internationalism and the restoration</v>

612
00:40:34.670 --> 00:40:36.020
<v Speaker 1>health of all the peoples</v>

613
00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.120
<v Speaker 1>against the infection of materialism</v>
<v Speaker 1>against the Jewish pestilence,</v>

614
00:40:41.121 --> 00:40:43.460
<v Speaker 1>we must hold a loft,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a flaming ideal.</v>

615
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.330
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that's also extremely</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting about Hitler's use of</v>

616
00:40:47.331 --> 00:40:51.560
<v Speaker 1>propaganda was his intense fascination</v>
<v Speaker 1>with fire.</v>

617
00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:56.260
<v Speaker 1>And the thing about fire is that it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>purifying elements to purifying elements</v>

618
00:40:56.270 --> 00:40:58.280
<v Speaker 1>symbolically as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

619
00:40:58.281 --> 00:41:00.890
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the Second World War was coming to</v>

620
00:41:00.891 --> 00:41:05.120
<v Speaker 1>a close and things had gone</v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophically wrong for the Germans,</v>

621
00:41:06.050 --> 00:41:11.050
<v Speaker 1>Hitler became extremely disenchanted</v>
<v Speaker 1>with his people and undertook actions</v>

622
00:41:13.311 --> 00:41:18.311
<v Speaker 1>that were by all appearances designed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>increase the degree to which Germany was</v>

623
00:41:19.341 --> 00:41:23.660
<v Speaker 1>destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it seems to me that that,</v>

624
00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:27.200
<v Speaker 1>and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is this kind of ties into the</v>

625
00:41:27.201 --> 00:41:31.790
<v Speaker 1>Friday and idea of a death wish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that Hitler had this fantasy</v>

626
00:41:31.791 --> 00:41:35.090
<v Speaker 1>that he laid out over his whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the best thing that could happen to</v>

627
00:41:35.091 --> 00:41:38.630
<v Speaker 1>life if it wasn't pure was that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>should be burnt in fire.</v>

628
00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:41.990
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's what happened in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Second World War.</v>

629
00:41:41.991 --> 00:41:45.770
<v Speaker 1>I think he lived that right out to its</v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimate conclusion because he shot</v>

630
00:41:45.771 --> 00:41:47.990
<v Speaker 1>himself in a bunker when Berlin was</v>
<v Speaker 1>burning,</v>

631
00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:49.371
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

632
00:41:49.371 --> 00:41:52.520
<v Speaker 1>and how fire has historically been used</v>
<v Speaker 1>for purification?</v>

633
00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:55.400
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not for no reason that many</v>

634
00:41:55.401 --> 00:41:58.130
<v Speaker 1>cultures burn bodies after people die.</v>

635
00:42:00.090 --> 00:42:00.560
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

636
00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:05.560
<v Speaker 1>The restoration to health of our people</v>
<v Speaker 1>must start from the restoration to</v>

637
00:42:06.081 --> 00:42:10.820
<v Speaker 1>health of the body politic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I give the order to burn out down to the</v>

638
00:42:10.821 --> 00:42:14.090
<v Speaker 1>raw flesh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ulcers of this poisoning of the</v>

639
00:42:14.091 --> 00:42:18.160
<v Speaker 1>wells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't get much more direct than</v>

640
00:42:18.161 --> 00:42:18.994
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

641
00:42:19.930 --> 00:42:20.410
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

642
00:42:20.410 --> 00:42:24.400
<v Speaker 1>The only way permanently to cure disease</v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions is to disclose their causes.</v>

643
00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:29.530
<v Speaker 1>Infections in countries lead to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>crippling of intelligence and of the</v>

644
00:42:29.531 --> 00:42:32.740
<v Speaker 1>forces of resistance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the battle against a veritable</v>

645
00:42:32.741 --> 00:42:35.740
<v Speaker 1>world sickness which threatens to infect</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people's a plague,</v>

646
00:42:35.741 --> 00:42:39.070
<v Speaker 1>which devastates whole peoples and</v>
<v Speaker 1>international pestilence.</v>

647
00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:42.520
<v Speaker 1>The international carrier of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bacillus must be fought.</v>

648
00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:45.670
<v Speaker 1>If within this community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one state is infected,</v>

649
00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:49.750
<v Speaker 1>that infection is decisive for all alike</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Europe,</v>

650
00:42:49.780 --> 00:42:54.160
<v Speaker 1>no common life of the nations and</v>
<v Speaker 1>possible is possible when amongst their</v>

651
00:42:54.161 --> 00:42:56.230
<v Speaker 1>number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are some who are suffering from a</v>

652
00:42:56.231 --> 00:43:00.400
<v Speaker 1>poisonous infection and who openly</v>
<v Speaker 1>profess their desire to infect others</v>

653
00:43:00.401 --> 00:43:04.480
<v Speaker 1>with the same disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a very real interest in seeing</v>

654
00:43:04.481 --> 00:43:06.940
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing to it that this bolshevist plague</v>

655
00:43:06.941 --> 00:43:10.480
<v Speaker 1>shall not spread over Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same terminology applied to the</v>

656
00:43:10.481 --> 00:43:13.300
<v Speaker 1>Communists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the communist threat moving in from the</v>

657
00:43:13.301 --> 00:43:16.300
<v Speaker 1>east.</v>
<v Speaker 1>National Socialism has made our people</v>

658
00:43:16.301 --> 00:43:19.120
<v Speaker 1>and therefore the right immune from a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bolshevik infection.</v>

659
00:43:20.770 --> 00:43:23.380
<v Speaker 1>For hundreds of years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany was good enough to receive these</v>

660
00:43:23.381 --> 00:43:24.790
<v Speaker 1>elements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jews,</v>

661
00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:27.010
<v Speaker 1>although they possessed nothing except</v>
<v Speaker 1>infectious,</v>

662
00:43:27.011 --> 00:43:31.170
<v Speaker 1>political and physical diseases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only when this Jewish Bacillus effecting</v>

663
00:43:31.210 --> 00:43:34.780
<v Speaker 1>the life of peoples has been removed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can one hope to establish a cooperation</v>

664
00:43:34.781 --> 00:43:37.720
<v Speaker 1>amongst the nations?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

665
00:43:37.721 --> 00:43:38.650
<v Speaker 1>you get the picture.</v>

666
00:43:47.410 --> 00:43:50.740
<v Speaker 1>I want to show you something now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is from a particularly pernicious</v>

667
00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:55.730
<v Speaker 1>propaganda film that was produced by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nazis.</v>

668
00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:10.530
<v Speaker 1>1344 2041</v>

669
00:44:20.910 --> 00:44:25.910
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

670
00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:40.510
<v Speaker 3>Choice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They settled there mercilessly.</v>

671
00:46:56.580 --> 00:46:59.970
<v Speaker 3>Totally different racial elements differ</v>
<v Speaker 3>from us.</v>

672
00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:08.250
<v Speaker 3>We probably would never been bothered by</v>
<v Speaker 3>them</v>

673
00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.630
<v Speaker 3>and</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially</v>

674
00:47:20.980 --> 00:47:25.980
<v Speaker 3>the Romans brought about the evolution</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the trade and migratory traits soon</v>

675
00:47:27.140 --> 00:47:29.290
<v Speaker 3>spread across the open Mediterranean</v>
<v Speaker 3>area.</v>

676
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:34.390
<v Speaker 3>While some of them settled in the large</v>
<v Speaker 3>urban centers of the Mediterranean,</v>

677
00:47:38.830 --> 00:47:42.070
<v Speaker 3>others wandered relentlessly on across</v>
<v Speaker 3>Spain,</v>

678
00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:44.620
<v Speaker 3>France,</v>
<v Speaker 3>southern Germany,</v>

679
00:47:45.250 --> 00:47:47.830
<v Speaker 3>and England.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everywhere.</v>

680
00:47:47.890 --> 00:47:51.790
<v Speaker 3>They made themselves unwelcome in Spain</v>
<v Speaker 3>and France.</v>

681
00:47:51.791 --> 00:47:55.330
<v Speaker 3>The people grows overlay against the</v>
<v Speaker 3>13th or 14th century,</v>

682
00:47:57.440 --> 00:48:02.440
<v Speaker 3>mainly the German</v>
<v Speaker 3>culture,</v>

683
00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:10.770
<v Speaker 3>creative Germans colonizing the east</v>
<v Speaker 3>until they finally found the gigantic</v>

684
00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:15.060
<v Speaker 3>reservoir in the Polish and Russian</v>
<v Speaker 3>sections of in</v>

685
00:48:17.230 --> 00:48:21.280
<v Speaker 3>the 19th century with its model.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ideas about human equality and freedom</v>

686
00:48:22.110 --> 00:48:24.150
<v Speaker 3>is a great lip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eastern Europe,</v>

687
00:48:24.190 --> 00:48:28.660
<v Speaker 3>they spread across the entire continent</v>
<v Speaker 3>during the 19th and 20th centuries and</v>

688
00:48:28.670 --> 00:48:33.670
<v Speaker 3>then across the</v>
<v Speaker 3>parallel to the Jewish monitoring</v>

689
00:48:43.110 --> 00:48:48.110
<v Speaker 3>throughout the world is the migration of</v>
<v Speaker 3>similarly restless animal,</v>

690
00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:53.900
<v Speaker 3>the</v>
<v Speaker 3>rat seven parasites from the very</v>

691
00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:57.110
<v Speaker 3>beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most,</v>

692
00:48:57.130 --> 00:49:00.400
<v Speaker 3>they might read it in gigantic Korea or</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russia</v>

693
00:49:03.550 --> 00:49:05.110
<v Speaker 3>or the middle of the 18th century.</v>

694
00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:11.140
<v Speaker 3>It's straight over all of Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where the end of the 19th century was</v>

695
00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:15.180
<v Speaker 3>the growing and shipping traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They dispossessed of America,</v>

696
00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:20.440
<v Speaker 3>Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and</v>

697
00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:30.000
<v Speaker 3>harass turn up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They carry the structure of the lab,</v>

698
00:49:30.890 --> 00:49:35.730
<v Speaker 3>but as frying mankind's goods and</v>
<v Speaker 3>spreading diseases this way,</v>

699
00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:38.800
<v Speaker 3>so just cholera,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dysentery,</v>

700
00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:44.460
<v Speaker 3>leprosy and typhoid fever</v>
<v Speaker 3>solidly and unusually a beard and a</v>

701
00:49:50.181 --> 00:49:53.920
<v Speaker 3>massive born.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They represent the elements of</v>

702
00:49:53.921 --> 00:49:57.380
<v Speaker 3>sneakiness and subterranean disruption</v>
<v Speaker 3>among animals</v>

703
00:49:59.050 --> 00:50:01.390
<v Speaker 3>just as the Jews knew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>among</v>

704
00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:16.350
<v Speaker 3>parasite,</v>
<v Speaker 3>responsible for a large part of the</v>

705
00:50:16.351 --> 00:50:21.351
<v Speaker 3>international crime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>On that 32 the Jews who made up only 1%</v>

706
00:50:21.911 --> 00:50:26.911
<v Speaker 3>of the world's population,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about 34% of the world's don't members,</v>

707
00:50:27.890 --> 00:50:32.890
<v Speaker 3>47%</v>
<v Speaker 3>47% are for the games of chance percent</v>

708
00:50:35.361 --> 00:50:40.361
<v Speaker 3>look international crime organizations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>98% of dealers and prostitutes</v>

709
00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:51.620
<v Speaker 3>in the jargon of international gangsters</v>
<v Speaker 3>stem from Hebrew and yiddish words,</v>

710
00:50:54.530 --> 00:50:58.150
<v Speaker 3>lease cars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the automobiles immediately liberal</v>

711
00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:01.230
<v Speaker 3>theory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the equality of all when they're</v>

712
00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:05.573
<v Speaker 3>older.</v>

713
00:51:09.810 --> 00:51:12.260
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll show you the four minutes</v>

714
00:51:25.010 --> 00:51:30.010
<v Speaker 3>recognizable</v>
<v Speaker 3>when spot is racial origin</v>

715
00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:37.560
<v Speaker 3>is that the oldest tries to hide his</v>
<v Speaker 3>origin.</v>

716
00:51:37.810 --> 00:51:42.810
<v Speaker 3>When a mom</v>
<v Speaker 3>still wearing cap towns</v>

717
00:52:06.980 --> 00:52:11.980
<v Speaker 3>in western European clothes repairing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>infiltrate the Western civilization</v>

718
00:52:22.330 --> 00:52:25.140
<v Speaker 3>and of course these ghetto Jews don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>get moved to,</v>

719
00:52:25.141 --> 00:52:27.320
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're clean and European bloats</v>

720
00:52:27.930 --> 00:52:30.010
<v Speaker 3>somewhat more wanted that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How did you,</v>

721
00:52:30.030 --> 00:52:33.660
<v Speaker 3>was Oberlin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their fathers and grandfathers,</v>

722
00:52:35.700 --> 00:52:40.700
<v Speaker 3>but that's not really noticeable here in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the second and third generation.</v>

723
00:52:43.330 --> 00:52:46.620
<v Speaker 3>I don't relate to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They tried to add just like the host</v>

724
00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:52.200
<v Speaker 3>people</v>
<v Speaker 3>instincts and let themselves be the</v>

725
00:52:52.411 --> 00:52:57.020
<v Speaker 3>seat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this mimicry is the same as they</v>

726
00:52:57.021 --> 00:53:00.900
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They will then lies the enormous danger.</v>

727
00:53:01.530 --> 00:53:06.020
<v Speaker 3>These assimilated was remain forever</v>
<v Speaker 3>foreign bodies and the organism or the</v>

728
00:53:06.130 --> 00:53:08.600
<v Speaker 3>host vehicles regardless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love Arizona.</v>

729
00:53:17.250 --> 00:53:22.250
<v Speaker 1>That film has the dubious distinction of</v>
<v Speaker 1>being perhaps the most evil single piece</v>

730
00:53:22.711 --> 00:53:27.270
<v Speaker 1>of propaganda the Nazi's ever produced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really saying something,</v>

731
00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:28.253
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

732
00:53:32.260 --> 00:53:33.093
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

733
00:53:34.450 --> 00:53:36.580
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned something like this a couple</v>
<v Speaker 1>of weeks ago.</v>

734
00:53:39.590 --> 00:53:42.860
<v Speaker 1>The thing that's so frightening about</v>
<v Speaker 1>this I think is that</v>

735
00:53:45.490 --> 00:53:45.940
<v Speaker 2>okay</v>

736
00:53:45.940 --> 00:53:48.460
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it shows you in some sense how</v>

737
00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:54.360
<v Speaker 1>delicately balanced society has to be in</v>
<v Speaker 1>order not to fall prey to a catastrophe</v>

738
00:53:55.601 --> 00:53:57.370
<v Speaker 1>on one side or a catastrophe on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

739
00:53:57.371 --> 00:54:00.880
<v Speaker 1>Because what we seem to be seeing here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in part</v>

740
00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:07.560
<v Speaker 1>is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of the overgeneralization</v>

741
00:54:11.980 --> 00:54:16.980
<v Speaker 1>of a deeply inborn human trait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of whose consequences appear to be</v>

742
00:54:19.570 --> 00:54:22.450
<v Speaker 1>necessary both for survival and</v>
<v Speaker 1>productivity.</v>

743
00:54:22.451 --> 00:54:27.451
<v Speaker 1>It would be such an easier problem if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could take the cause which is at</v>

744
00:54:28.901 --> 00:54:33.901
<v Speaker 1>least in so far as this argument runs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is sensitivity to discussed</v>

745
00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:40.750
<v Speaker 1>and just assume that that in it in its</v>
<v Speaker 1>entirety as a form of pathology,</v>

746
00:54:40.780 --> 00:54:45.780
<v Speaker 1>but you can't do that because</v>
<v Speaker 1>sensitivity to discussed does protect</v>

747
00:54:48.401 --> 00:54:49.720
<v Speaker 1>people from pathogens,</v>

748
00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:56.920
<v Speaker 1>but if you push it too far while then</v>
<v Speaker 1>things seem to fall apart in an</v>

749
00:54:57.021 --> 00:55:01.250
<v Speaker 1>absolutely atrocious way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I've found so</v>

750
00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:06.340
<v Speaker 1>illuminating about this line of research</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that it answers a question that</v>

751
00:55:07.161 --> 00:55:09.410
<v Speaker 1>people have struggled with for a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>long period of time,</v>

752
00:55:09.411 --> 00:55:14.411
<v Speaker 1>which is how is it possible for human</v>
<v Speaker 1>beings to dehumanize other people?</v>

753
00:55:14.691 --> 00:55:18.710
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer that you would derive from</v>

754
00:55:18.711 --> 00:55:23.420
<v Speaker 1>this line of reasoning makes the</v>
<v Speaker 1>question quite mixed.</v>

755
00:55:23.421 --> 00:55:28.010
<v Speaker 1>The answer quite obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just associate health with what</v>

756
00:55:28.011 --> 00:55:32.900
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to promote and to validate</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you associate that with purity and</v>

757
00:55:32.901 --> 00:55:37.520
<v Speaker 1>then you associate the other with</v>
<v Speaker 1>illness and disease.</v>

758
00:55:37.790 --> 00:55:42.790
<v Speaker 1>And then you have a metaphor lying</v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath that that's just ready for</v>

759
00:55:43.041 --> 00:55:47.330
<v Speaker 1>the taking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a powerful metaphor and it</v>

760
00:55:47.331 --> 00:55:52.331
<v Speaker 1>still seems to have immense effect on</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in so far as it is parasite</v>

761
00:55:52.731 --> 00:55:56.110
<v Speaker 1>prevalence that predicts authoritarian</v>
<v Speaker 1>political attitudes.</v>

762
00:55:56.120 --> 00:55:58.850
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nope.</v>

763
00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:01.320
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I don't understand is</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the,</v>

764
00:56:04.940 --> 00:56:08.030
<v Speaker 1>one of the things we talked about in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>existential lectures was</v>

765
00:56:09.820 --> 00:56:14.420
<v Speaker 1>the existential idea that one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that promoted the development of</v>

766
00:56:14.421 --> 00:56:19.421
<v Speaker 1>totalitarian states was the willingness</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the people who were occupied by the</v>

767
00:56:19.431 --> 00:56:23.240
<v Speaker 1>totalitarian ideology to falsify their</v>
<v Speaker 1>own personal experience,</v>

768
00:56:23.710 --> 00:56:26.440
<v Speaker 1>to keep it in accordance with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>totalitarian claims.</v>

769
00:56:26.441 --> 00:56:28.210
<v Speaker 1>So there was the idea of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>

770
00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:30.490
<v Speaker 1>of the lie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Frankel makes much of,</v>

771
00:56:32.530 --> 00:56:37.530
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe the lie in part is</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's gotta be something like the denial</v>

772
00:56:42.541 --> 00:56:47.280
<v Speaker 1>of your own identity with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability that you want to shunt off</v>

773
00:56:47.281 --> 00:56:51.210
<v Speaker 1>into others and persecute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

774
00:56:51.260 --> 00:56:55.260
<v Speaker 1>the taking to yourself of everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>that constitutes purity and perfection.</v>

775
00:56:55.830 --> 00:57:00.830
<v Speaker 1>And then the lady,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the overburdening the other with</v>

776
00:57:02.310 --> 00:57:04.980
<v Speaker 1>everything that you don't want to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>true about yourself.</v>

777
00:57:07.370 --> 00:57:08.340
<v Speaker 4>It's true in the,</v>

778
00:57:09.820 --> 00:57:14.230
<v Speaker 1>what you don't want to be true about</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself is partly that actuality of</v>

779
00:57:14.231 --> 00:57:19.231
<v Speaker 1>physical degeneration and decay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it seems to me that the reality of</v>

780
00:57:19.930 --> 00:57:24.280
<v Speaker 1>moral degeneration and decay is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very close analog to that they stack on</v>

781
00:57:24.281 --> 00:57:29.170
<v Speaker 1>top of one another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe the lie is that you're not</v>

782
00:57:29.171 --> 00:57:30.700
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they are.</v>

783
00:57:34.130 --> 00:57:35.970
<v Speaker 1>And that provides at least a partial</v>
<v Speaker 1>answer</v>

784
00:57:39.470 --> 00:57:40.303
<v Speaker 4>anyways,</v>

785
00:57:41.930 --> 00:57:43.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't have much more to say about that</v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

786
00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:47.240
<v Speaker 1>So maybe we could take some time for</v>
<v Speaker 1>questions</v>

787
00:57:49.070 --> 00:57:54.070
<v Speaker 4>if you have any,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

788
00:57:55.830 --> 00:57:57.300
<v Speaker 4>social,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

789
00:57:58.530 --> 00:58:03.530
<v Speaker 4>immune system</v>
<v Speaker 4>balances better overall because you</v>

790
00:58:06.361 --> 00:58:11.361
<v Speaker 4>think about children who are brazen</v>
<v Speaker 4>as they grow up to be adults with these</v>

791
00:58:12.751 --> 00:58:16.490
<v Speaker 4>like crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's almost like</v>

792
00:58:18.110 --> 00:58:23.110
<v Speaker 4>a less conservative views.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's almost like you're looking at it.</v>

793
00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:25.520
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting idea.</v>

794
00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:28.340
<v Speaker 1>Well that's an interesting metaphoric</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>

795
00:58:28.940 --> 00:58:32.930
<v Speaker 1>So the idea there would be that by</v>
<v Speaker 1>insisting upon radical purity,</v>

796
00:58:32.931 --> 00:58:37.100
<v Speaker 1>you actually weaken a society a just</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you would weaken and an immune</v>

797
00:58:37.101 --> 00:58:37.934
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

798
00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:41.150
<v Speaker 4>But then if you expose yourself to those</v>
<v Speaker 4>ideas,</v>

799
00:58:41.540 --> 00:58:46.540
<v Speaker 4>then when you go into</v>
<v Speaker 4>a broad spectrum of like whatever kind</v>

800
00:58:51.610 --> 00:58:52.443
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

801
00:58:54.500 --> 00:58:55.281
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a pretty good,</v>

802
00:58:55.281 --> 00:58:58.370
<v Speaker 1>that would be pretty good defense of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of a liberal education.</v>

803
00:58:58.730 --> 00:59:00.080
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because on the one hand,</v>

804
00:59:00.081 --> 00:59:01.610
<v Speaker 1>if you're a fundamentalist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to say,</v>

805
00:59:01.611 --> 00:59:03.020
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

806
00:59:03.260 --> 00:59:07.670
<v Speaker 1>you're only going to be taught the ideas</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are exactly in keeping with the</v>

807
00:59:07.671 --> 00:59:11.300
<v Speaker 1>most pure of doctrines of your people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as you,</v>

808
00:59:11.510 --> 00:59:13.190
<v Speaker 1>as you pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite rightly,</v>

809
00:59:13.191 --> 00:59:17.630
<v Speaker 1>that means that the second you step</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of that protective influence and</v>

810
00:59:17.631 --> 00:59:20.870
<v Speaker 1>you hear any other ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gone because you have no defense</v>

811
00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:22.040
<v Speaker 1>them whatsoever.</v>

812
00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:24.793
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

813
00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:33.570
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's like a resilience argument</v>

814
00:59:33.571 --> 00:59:35.150
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

815
00:59:35.180 --> 00:59:40.180
<v Speaker 1>the idea and the liberal association</v>
<v Speaker 1>with openness would be something akin to</v>

816
00:59:40.261 --> 00:59:40.801
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

817
00:59:40.801 --> 00:59:45.210
<v Speaker 1>Because open people are interested new</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences and new ideas and they value</v>

818
00:59:45.211 --> 00:59:46.530
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now</v>

819
00:59:49.110 --> 00:59:52.200
<v Speaker 1>the reason that opened people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in value them seems to be</v>

820
00:59:52.201 --> 00:59:54.400
<v Speaker 1>something pretty primordial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They find new intro,</v>

821
00:59:54.510 --> 00:59:57.270
<v Speaker 1>new ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deeply meaningful and the tract.</v>

822
00:59:58.020 --> 01:00:01.560
<v Speaker 1>But you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can certainly be sure that</v>

823
01:00:01.561 --> 01:00:06.561
<v Speaker 1>throughout human history there's been</v>
<v Speaker 1>this tension between whether opening up</v>

824
01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:12.780
<v Speaker 1>produces more longterm strengthening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then rigidified and closing down.</v>

825
01:00:15.570 --> 01:00:17.970
<v Speaker 1>Well it's a gamble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

826
01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:23.540
<v Speaker 1>liberal countries definitely take the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ladder strategy and you know,</v>

827
01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:30.060
<v Speaker 1>there hasn't been a war of any</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence between two liberal</v>

828
01:00:30.061 --> 01:00:34.110
<v Speaker 1>democracies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there is some historical evidence to</v>

829
01:00:34.111 --> 01:00:37.320
<v Speaker 1>suggest that it's working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're peaceful societies,</v>

830
01:00:37.321 --> 01:00:42.210
<v Speaker 1>general speaking internally as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So other questions?</v>

831
01:00:42.870 --> 01:00:43.703
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

832
01:00:51.870 --> 01:00:53.620
<v Speaker 4>One of them.</v>

833
01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:11.630
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of this research is still in its</v>

834
01:01:11.631 --> 01:01:14.060
<v Speaker 1>infancy and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

835
01:01:14.110 --> 01:01:16.520
<v Speaker 1>the strength,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the strength of the association between</v>

836
01:01:16.521 --> 01:01:18.980
<v Speaker 1>socioeconomic status and disgust</v>
<v Speaker 1>sensitivity.</v>

837
01:01:19.250 --> 01:01:22.760
<v Speaker 1>I would say that's something that's been</v>
<v Speaker 1>more suggested than something that's,</v>

838
01:01:23.230 --> 01:01:28.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>demonstrated and attributed to increased</v>

839
01:01:28.241 --> 01:01:30.080
<v Speaker 1>disgust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sensitivity at the lower end of the</v>

840
01:01:30.081 --> 01:01:30.914
<v Speaker 1>spectrum.</v>

841
01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:31.873
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

842
01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:33.901
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

843
01:01:33.901 --> 01:01:36.240
<v Speaker 1>everything I told you today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still a hypothesis.</v>

844
01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:38.940
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because it's all new.</v>

845
01:01:39.060 --> 01:01:40.540
<v Speaker 1>It's new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all,</v>

846
01:01:40.650 --> 01:01:45.510
<v Speaker 1>all of this data has been gathered</v>
<v Speaker 1>within the last 15 years,</v>

847
01:01:45.511 --> 01:01:48.750
<v Speaker 1>10 or 15 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so people are still trying to sort</v>

848
01:01:48.751 --> 01:01:50.490
<v Speaker 1>out what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

849
01:01:50.491 --> 01:01:54.990
<v Speaker 1>I think that study I showed you showing</v>
<v Speaker 1>the correlation of point,</v>

850
01:01:55.230 --> 01:01:56.100
<v Speaker 1>was it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was it?</v>

851
01:01:56.110 --> 01:02:01.110
<v Speaker 1>Point four 5.4 9.42 b between a</v>
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian political attitudes and</v>

852
01:02:04.831 --> 01:02:06.210
<v Speaker 1>parasite prevalence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

853
01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:10.050
<v Speaker 1>that's a jaw dropping study.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who the hell would have ever guessed</v>

854
01:02:10.051 --> 01:02:11.070
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

855
01:02:11.071 --> 01:02:14.070
<v Speaker 1>when it makes sense in retrospect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you look at,</v>

856
01:02:14.310 --> 01:02:17.430
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hitler's propaganda and the discussions</v>

857
01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:20.790
<v Speaker 1>in light of that data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as far as I could tell,</v>

858
01:02:24.710 --> 01:02:26.450
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sort of material just hasn't been</v>

859
01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:28.670
<v Speaker 1>brought together before by historians.</v>

860
01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:01.650
<v Speaker 1>I do you know that that's a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>question too because it's not exactly</v>

861
01:03:01.651 --> 01:03:05.220
<v Speaker 1>clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's exactly clear why</v>

862
01:03:05.221 --> 01:03:10.170
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian attitudes would mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are the implications of the paper</v>

863
01:03:10.171 --> 01:03:14.430
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally is that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a reason that authoritarian</v>

864
01:03:14.431 --> 01:03:17.040
<v Speaker 1>attitudes appear when there's parasite</v>
<v Speaker 1>prevalence.</v>

865
01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:19.500
<v Speaker 1>The court,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the association is very strong,</v>

866
01:03:19.501 --> 01:03:22.290
<v Speaker 1>so one of the things you could infer</v>
<v Speaker 1>from that was that there's actually some</v>

867
01:03:22.291 --> 01:03:25.530
<v Speaker 1>utility in it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps not.</v>

868
01:03:25.531 --> 01:03:30.531
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps it's only that if you're so</v>
<v Speaker 1>stressed by disease and parasites and so</v>

869
01:03:31.831 --> 01:03:34.080
<v Speaker 1>forth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just don't want to have anything to</v>

870
01:03:34.081 --> 01:03:39.081
<v Speaker 1>do with any other kind of uncertainty or</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's that you revert to extremely</v>

871
01:03:39.181 --> 01:03:43.710
<v Speaker 1>traditional and order bound ways of</v>
<v Speaker 1>interacting in an attempt to decrease</v>

872
01:03:43.711 --> 01:03:47.100
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you'll be exposed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exposed to the parasites.</v>

873
01:03:47.940 --> 01:03:48.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

874
01:03:52.870 --> 01:03:57.870
<v Speaker 4>Do you think it's related to</v>
<v Speaker 4>Zombie survival TV shows and infection</v>

875
01:04:01.090 --> 01:04:02.380
<v Speaker 4>yet the band together?</v>

876
01:04:05.130 --> 01:04:05.881
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

877
01:04:05.881 --> 01:04:08.980
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly the same sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

878
01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.290
<v Speaker 1>The funny thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Zombie,</v>

879
01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:14.340
<v Speaker 1>the Zombie idea though puts a weird</v>
<v Speaker 1>twist on it that was more associated</v>

880
01:04:14.341 --> 01:04:16.050
<v Speaker 1>with your hypothesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that,</v>

881
01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:19.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the zombies are also often mindlessly</v>

882
01:04:19.591 --> 01:04:24.591
<v Speaker 1>obedient and then they become</v>
<v Speaker 1>diseased and decaying and dad and,</v>

883
01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:28.260
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

884
01:04:28.510 --> 01:04:29.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cannibalistic.</v>

885
01:04:30.660 --> 01:04:35.100
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>it definitely does seem to be the case</v>

886
01:04:35.101 --> 01:04:39.000
<v Speaker 1>that if you take many virtues too far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they produce exactly the consequence</v>

887
01:04:39.001 --> 01:04:41.460
<v Speaker 1>that the person that was pushing them</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to avoid.</v>

888
01:04:42.210 --> 01:04:47.210
<v Speaker 1>So that seems to me to be a really good</v>
<v Speaker 1>argument against the extension of</v>

889
01:04:49.300 --> 01:04:52.230
<v Speaker 1>the idea of orderliness too far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to kick back and produce a</v>

890
01:04:52.231 --> 01:04:55.170
<v Speaker 1>hell of a lot more chaos than you think</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't keep it in balance with the</v>

891
01:04:55.171 --> 01:04:56.670
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

892
01:04:56.671 --> 01:05:01.671
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things that the big</v>
<v Speaker 1>five model seems to indicate is that in</v>

893
01:05:02.311 --> 01:05:04.620
<v Speaker 1>order to keep yourself oriented in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>environment,</v>

894
01:05:06.030 --> 01:05:10.050
<v Speaker 1>you have to have five dimensions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>value because otherwise there wouldn't</v>

895
01:05:10.051 --> 01:05:11.820
<v Speaker 1>be five dimensions of value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

896
01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:15.780
<v Speaker 1>And maybe if you collapse everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>into a single dimension,</v>

897
01:05:16.670 --> 01:05:20.350
<v Speaker 1>you tighten down so much that they can</v>
<v Speaker 1>no longer function properly.</v>

898
01:05:20.351 --> 01:05:24.550
<v Speaker 1>And then everything tends to deteriorate</v>
<v Speaker 1>into chaos and there's gotta be a</v>

899
01:05:24.551 --> 01:05:26.080
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's five dimensions,</v>

900
01:05:26.950 --> 01:05:28.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have to regulate your social</v>

901
01:05:28.841 --> 01:05:30.700
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be extroversion at least to</v>

902
01:05:30.701 --> 01:05:34.640
<v Speaker 1>some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to respond to threat and</v>

903
01:05:34.650 --> 01:05:39.650
<v Speaker 1>punishment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to care for or exploit other</v>

904
01:05:40.301 --> 01:05:42.360
<v Speaker 1>people roughly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

905
01:05:42.370 --> 01:05:44.590
<v Speaker 1>you have to care for other people and</v>
<v Speaker 1>care for yourself.</v>

906
01:05:44.591 --> 01:05:47.950
<v Speaker 1>That would be agreeableness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say disgust,</v>

907
01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:51.370
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness at length,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then of course openness is basically</v>

908
01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:56.590
<v Speaker 1>the intake of new information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to solve all five of those</v>

909
01:05:56.591 --> 01:05:59.830
<v Speaker 1>problems in order for things to remain</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some kind of reasonable balance.</v>

910
01:06:00.430 --> 01:06:04.090
<v Speaker 1>You might even be able to make a case</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you want to keep a society</v>

911
01:06:04.091 --> 01:06:07.450
<v Speaker 1>optimally organized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>given that there's variability on each</v>

912
01:06:07.451 --> 01:06:10.810
<v Speaker 1>of those dimensions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to keep a conversation going</v>

913
01:06:11.710 --> 01:06:15.460
<v Speaker 1>between everyone in that five</v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensional space regardless of where</v>

914
01:06:15.461 --> 01:06:18.310
<v Speaker 1>they're located on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the distribution.</v>

915
01:06:18.310 --> 01:06:23.310
<v Speaker 1>Because</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the idea is to optimize the fit of</v>

916
01:06:24.941 --> 01:06:29.710
<v Speaker 1>the society to the shape of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>environment at any given time,</v>

917
01:06:30.250 --> 01:06:33.700
<v Speaker 1>that's going to be a very complicated</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem because you don't exactly know</v>

918
01:06:33.701 --> 01:06:38.410
<v Speaker 1>what shape the environment is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you could keep the dialogue going</v>

919
01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:42.400
<v Speaker 1>between all the interested parties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you can move this society along</v>

920
01:06:42.401 --> 01:06:45.850
<v Speaker 1>properly and keep it matched enough to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the environment so that it can stay</v>

921
01:06:45.851 --> 01:06:49.390
<v Speaker 1>healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you tilt it too much in the</v>

922
01:06:49.391 --> 01:06:52.630
<v Speaker 1>direction of any of these unit</v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensional values,</v>

923
01:06:52.631 --> 01:06:56.890
<v Speaker 1>then it's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to increase the probability</v>

924
01:06:56.891 --> 01:07:01.660
<v Speaker 1>that it'll collapse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That could be because otherwise I can't</v>

925
01:07:01.661 --> 01:07:03.580
<v Speaker 1>understand why there would be five</v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensions.</v>

926
01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:05.410
<v Speaker 1>They must be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're necessary,</v>

927
01:07:05.411 --> 01:07:06.670
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense.</v>

928
01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:10.620
<v Speaker 4>So</v>
<v Speaker 4>other questions?</v>

929
01:07:12.310 --> 01:07:13.410
<v Speaker 4>So what do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

930
01:07:15.140 --> 01:07:20.140
<v Speaker 4>Correlation between</v>
<v Speaker 4>one sort of conservative.</v>

931
01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:22.051
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

932
01:07:22.051 --> 01:07:23.460
<v Speaker 1>I made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made an analogy.</v>

933
01:07:23.550 --> 01:07:24.383
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

934
01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:26.040
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which one was that?</v>

935
01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:29.910
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if your sales go ahead and do their own</v>

936
01:07:29.911 --> 01:07:32.880
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you develop cancer.</v>

937
01:07:33.450 --> 01:07:36.270
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My point being that if you're going to</v>

938
01:07:36.271 --> 01:07:39.810
<v Speaker 1>organize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I individual entities into a</v>

939
01:07:39.811 --> 01:07:43.290
<v Speaker 1>higher order structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's obviously some minimum of</v>

940
01:07:43.291 --> 01:07:48.291
<v Speaker 1>cooperation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what would you call similarity,</v>

941
01:07:48.750 --> 01:07:52.830
<v Speaker 1>uniformity between those members or it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not going to work.</v>

942
01:07:53.010 --> 01:07:55.260
<v Speaker 1>And the question is always how uniform</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should be.</v>

943
01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:58.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean the [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea was that you should be uniform</v>

944
01:07:58.800 --> 01:07:59.930
<v Speaker 1>and everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

945
01:07:59.970 --> 01:08:04.080
<v Speaker 1>basically you would be just one person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that probably does,</v>

946
01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:12.000
<v Speaker 1>that does bear some similarity to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>case that you made because what you see</v>

947
01:08:12.001 --> 01:08:16.130
<v Speaker 1>in extremely authoritarian states as</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are trying to reduce the,</v>

948
01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:21.230
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the human complexity to the</v>

949
01:08:21.231 --> 01:08:24.980
<v Speaker 1>manifestation of a single personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the problem with that is that if</v>

950
01:08:24.981 --> 01:08:27.680
<v Speaker 1>that single personalities matched</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfectly to the environment,</v>

951
01:08:27.681 --> 01:08:29.030
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be extremely efficient.</v>

952
01:08:29.390 --> 01:08:32.630
<v Speaker 1>But the probability that it's going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be perfectly matched is basically zero.</v>

953
01:08:33.050 --> 01:08:36.440
<v Speaker 1>There's too many possible environments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if the authoritarians push all</v>

954
01:08:36.441 --> 01:08:39.110
<v Speaker 1>the variability out of the state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what they want to do,</v>

955
01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:40.910
<v Speaker 1>then it's going to weaken it across</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

956
01:08:41.030 --> 01:08:43.220
<v Speaker 1>not strengthen it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

957
01:08:43.221 --> 01:08:46.640
<v Speaker 1>most political battles you have to fight</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the turf of your opponent,</v>

958
01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:48.350
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they're not gonna listen,</v>

959
01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:50.750
<v Speaker 1>like left wingers and right wingers</v>
<v Speaker 1>never listened to each other.</v>

960
01:08:51.380 --> 01:08:53.780
<v Speaker 1>So if you want to communicate with</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who is on the right,</v>

961
01:08:53.810 --> 01:08:56.390
<v Speaker 1>you have to communicate using the</v>
<v Speaker 1>language of the right.</v>

962
01:08:56.630 --> 01:08:58.250
<v Speaker 1>If you want to communicate with someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the left,</v>

963
01:08:58.251 --> 01:09:00.980
<v Speaker 1>do you have to communicate using the</v>
<v Speaker 1>language on the left,</v>

964
01:09:00.981 --> 01:09:03.290
<v Speaker 1>at least roughly speaking because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

965
01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:06.110
<v Speaker 1>the values differ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the strongest case you would make</v>

966
01:09:06.111 --> 01:09:09.620
<v Speaker 1>against right wing authoritarianism</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be that the authoritarianism</v>

967
01:09:09.621 --> 01:09:14.621
<v Speaker 1>itself pushed too far would endanger the</v>
<v Speaker 1>values that the conservatives themselves</v>

968
01:09:14.931 --> 01:09:18.230
<v Speaker 1>water maintain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a hard argument to refute.</v>

969
01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:23.650
<v Speaker 4>That wasn't their prime example not too</v>
<v Speaker 4>long ago where there they did a study</v>

970
01:09:23.651 --> 01:09:27.190
<v Speaker 4>where they change the semantic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just like the wording of something.</v>

971
01:09:27.330 --> 01:09:28.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pollution.</v>

972
01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:30.231
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

973
01:09:30.231 --> 01:09:32.940
<v Speaker 1>I see you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you appeal to purity concerns when</v>

974
01:09:32.941 --> 01:09:35.010
<v Speaker 1>you're doing environmental,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

975
01:09:35.070 --> 01:09:36.330
<v Speaker 1>agitating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

976
01:09:36.331 --> 01:09:41.331
<v Speaker 1>or messaging purity concerns are much</v>
<v Speaker 1>more effective or on conservatives.</v>

977
01:09:42.210 --> 01:09:43.350
<v Speaker 1>So you can show them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

978
01:09:43.351 --> 01:09:45.420
<v Speaker 1>pictures of polluted water and that sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of thing.</v>

979
01:09:45.421 --> 01:09:47.250
<v Speaker 1>They're quite responsive to that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

980
01:09:47.670 --> 01:09:49.740
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than we should respect our animal</v>

981
01:09:49.741 --> 01:09:51.810
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would be something that would be</v>

982
01:09:51.811 --> 01:09:54.270
<v Speaker 1>more appealing to someone who's on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>liberal side of things.</v>

983
01:09:54.271 --> 01:09:56.130
<v Speaker 1>Because they tend to be more</v>
<v Speaker 1>egalitarian.</v>

984
01:09:56.970 --> 01:09:59.730
<v Speaker 1>So what do you think about having been</v>
<v Speaker 1>shown that film?</v>

985
01:10:01.510 --> 01:10:03.770
<v Speaker 1>Is that an acceptable thing to do in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>class?</v>

986
01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:08.580
<v Speaker 1>What did people say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody think?</v>

987
01:10:08.590 --> 01:10:12.780
<v Speaker 1>Not you can say so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm curious.</v>

988
01:10:14.170 --> 01:10:14.510
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

989
01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:17.210
<v Speaker 1>So that was all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

990
01:10:22.620 --> 01:10:24.600
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

991
01:10:24.601 --> 01:10:27.300
<v Speaker 1>Well I'd have to bar the doors</v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise.</v>

992
01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:30.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

993
01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:42.790
<v Speaker 1>Well I don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that you can,</v>

994
01:10:42.820 --> 01:10:44.300
<v Speaker 1>you can combat anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>

995
01:10:44.350 --> 01:10:46.990
<v Speaker 1>you don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is,</v>

996
01:10:46.991 --> 01:10:49.270
<v Speaker 1>is that understanding some things isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>very pleasant,</v>

997
01:10:49.810 --> 01:10:52.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because once you understand them,</v>

998
01:10:52.190 --> 01:10:55.660
<v Speaker 1>this is a Rogerian perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you understand them.</v>

999
01:10:57.090 --> 01:10:57.690
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1000
01:10:57.690 --> 01:11:00.570
<v Speaker 1>To understand something is to see how</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's allowable.</v>

1001
01:11:00.571 --> 01:11:03.890
<v Speaker 1>He human,</v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise you don't understand it.</v>

1002
01:11:04.010 --> 01:11:05.900
<v Speaker 1>And that's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's rough.</v>

1003
01:11:07.390 --> 01:11:09.010
<v Speaker 4>There's like a weird paradox that</v>
<v Speaker 4>exists.</v>

1004
01:11:09.030 --> 01:11:10.930
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>
<v Speaker 4>while I'm watching this,</v>

1005
01:11:11.220 --> 01:11:14.750
<v Speaker 4>I feel that my viewpoints,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1006
01:11:14.810 --> 01:11:15.620
<v Speaker 4>would be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1007
01:11:15.620 --> 01:11:19.350
<v Speaker 4>if someone who embodied the idea alone</v>
<v Speaker 4>that isn't a bill,</v>

1008
01:11:19.590 --> 01:11:22.710
<v Speaker 4>where did directly be opposed to like my</v>
<v Speaker 4>position,</v>

1009
01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:26.100
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and feel that my views and way of life,</v>

1010
01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:28.050
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>living in Canadian society,</v>

1011
01:11:28.350 --> 01:11:29.910
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is cancerous.</v>

1012
01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:32.920
<v Speaker 4>But here I am sitting like watching this</v>
<v Speaker 4>film and I'm thinking of like,</v>

1013
01:11:33.150 --> 01:11:35.940
<v Speaker 4>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't imagine that they can't.</v>

1014
01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:36.990
<v Speaker 4>It's just a cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't it?</v>

1015
01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:38.733
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1016
01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:40.330
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1017
01:11:40.330 --> 01:11:43.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I mean the Nazis claims very much</v>

1018
01:11:43.540 --> 01:11:46.810
<v Speaker 1>antithetical to western liberal claims</v>
<v Speaker 1>in every possible way.</v>

1019
01:11:46.811 --> 01:11:51.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean they viewed in modern society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we think of being cosmopolitan has a</v>

1020
01:11:51.641 --> 01:11:53.560
<v Speaker 1>virtue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what it means is no matter</v>

1021
01:11:53.561 --> 01:11:55.120
<v Speaker 1>where you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1022
01:11:55.121 --> 01:11:59.470
<v Speaker 1>you could adapt for the Nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That meant you'd been fatally corrupted.</v>

1023
01:12:01.820 --> 01:12:06.320
<v Speaker 1>How are you</v>
<v Speaker 1>attached to a persona or two,</v>

1024
01:12:06.321 --> 01:12:10.510
<v Speaker 1>one personality trait of themselves and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so cyclical apology happens.</v>

1025
01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:15.770
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking that we do something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>this all the time when we make a mistake</v>

1026
01:12:15.771 --> 01:12:19.860
<v Speaker 1>where we said like there's a part of us</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is irresponsible that I just need</v>

1027
01:12:19.861 --> 01:12:23.210
<v Speaker 1>to like just crush your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the control entirely.</v>

1028
01:12:23.211 --> 01:12:26.540
<v Speaker 1>I just want to be this copy intelligent</v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

1029
01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:29.860
<v Speaker 1>You want to move and we try to crush</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything else.</v>

1030
01:12:31.050 --> 01:12:34.980
<v Speaker 1>That's a good segue into the existential</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of the lie</v>

1031
01:12:36.570 --> 01:12:41.570
<v Speaker 1>because the psychoanalysts constantly</v>
<v Speaker 1>reminded people that there was very much</v>

1032
01:12:42.001 --> 01:12:47.001
<v Speaker 1>danger in cutting off a particular part</v>
<v Speaker 1>of you and regarding it as diseased,</v>

1033
01:12:47.770 --> 01:12:48.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1034
01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:50.680
<v Speaker 1>and part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should have remembered that and you</v>

1035
01:12:50.681 --> 01:12:52.710
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of young's claim because he spent a</v>

1036
01:12:52.711 --> 01:12:54.660
<v Speaker 1>lot of time thinking about the Nazis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that</v>

1037
01:12:56.550 --> 01:12:58.920
<v Speaker 1>if you alienate yourself from part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

1038
01:12:58.921 --> 01:13:02.430
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to do the same thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>to anyone who resembles that part of</v>

1039
01:13:02.431 --> 01:13:03.264
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

1040
01:13:03.870 --> 01:13:06.810
<v Speaker 1>And so you have to be very careful about</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing that.</v>

1041
01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:09.930
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy named Eric [inaudible] who was</v>

1042
01:13:09.931 --> 01:13:13.050
<v Speaker 1>one of young students and he wrote a</v>
<v Speaker 1>book at the end of the second world war</v>

1043
01:13:13.950 --> 01:13:18.050
<v Speaker 1>called depth psychology to new ethic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that noise</v>

1044
01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:20.610
<v Speaker 1>proposed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was Jewish by the way.</v>

1045
01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:24.720
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that Norman proposed</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that you don't try to be any better</v>

1046
01:13:24.721 --> 01:13:28.950
<v Speaker 1>than you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by that he meant to not engage in</v>

1047
01:13:28.951 --> 01:13:31.710
<v Speaker 1>that kind of radical splitting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't mean you shouldn't try to</v>

1048
01:13:31.711 --> 01:13:34.830
<v Speaker 1>improve your moral character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He meant that it's very dangerous to</v>

1049
01:13:34.831 --> 01:13:39.831
<v Speaker 1>pretend that you're entirely pure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1050
01:13:40.411 --> 01:13:41.244
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

1051
01:13:43.710 --> 01:13:47.190
<v Speaker 1>it's a tough one because you don't want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to eliminate the possibility of moral</v>

1052
01:13:47.191 --> 01:13:48.480
<v Speaker 1>striving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>

1053
01:13:48.660 --> 01:13:50.100
<v Speaker 1>because then there's no op,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1054
01:13:50.101 --> 01:13:54.510
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it certainly has to be tempered with</v>

1055
01:13:54.511 --> 01:13:55.350
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1056
01:13:55.351 --> 01:13:57.000
<v Speaker 1>probably tempered with compassion.</v>

1057
01:13:58.140 --> 01:14:01.080
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that's the idea of tempering</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the personality trait domain.</v>

1058
01:14:01.810 --> 01:14:03.990
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I do with people who</v>

1059
01:14:03.991 --> 01:14:07.020
<v Speaker 1>are agreeable because they don't stand</v>
<v Speaker 1>up for themselves very well.</v>

1060
01:14:07.740 --> 01:14:11.070
<v Speaker 1>If they're agreeable and conscientious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I encouraged them to tell the truth,</v>

1061
01:14:11.830 --> 01:14:13.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if they're being oppressed and</v>

1062
01:14:13.541 --> 01:14:15.850
<v Speaker 1>then they get resentful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which always happens to agreeable</v>

1063
01:14:15.851 --> 01:14:18.190
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I make a case that they have to</v>

1064
01:14:18.191 --> 01:14:23.191
<v Speaker 1>temper their agreeableness with some</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness and adopted as a moral</v>

1065
01:14:24.431 --> 01:14:27.610
<v Speaker 1>obligation to speak out on behalf of</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>

1066
01:14:27.611 --> 01:14:29.860
<v Speaker 1>despite the fact that they won't like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the conflict,</v>

1067
01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:32.380
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I guess if you're an orderly person.</v>

1068
01:14:37.580 --> 01:14:38.413
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1069
01:14:41.470 --> 01:14:44.050
<v Speaker 1>My wife had a dream once about this that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just remembered.</v>

1070
01:14:44.530 --> 01:14:48.310
<v Speaker 1>She's quite an orderly person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she had a dream at one point that</v>

1071
01:14:48.311 --> 01:14:52.930
<v Speaker 1>she walked into an auditorium that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>full of people like this.</v>

1072
01:14:52.931 --> 01:14:56.320
<v Speaker 1>And she came down to the front of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>auditorium where all the men and the</v>

1073
01:14:56.321 --> 01:15:01.240
<v Speaker 1>dogs were and sat with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was a dream about the</v>

1074
01:15:01.241 --> 01:15:03.520
<v Speaker 1>relationship between orderliness and</v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness,</v>

1075
01:15:03.940 --> 01:15:05.070
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1076
01:15:05.290 --> 01:15:07.780
<v Speaker 1>if you're orderly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem is you can get so damn</v>

1077
01:15:07.781 --> 01:15:11.050
<v Speaker 1>orderly that can't stand people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't stand men and dogs,</v>

1078
01:15:11.051 --> 01:15:12.820
<v Speaker 1>which was what her dream was basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1079
01:15:12.821 --> 01:15:14.750
<v Speaker 1>she was making them equivalent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1080
01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:19.090
<v Speaker 1>so dog shed all over the house and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>know they're annoying and stupid and you</v>

1081
01:15:19.091 --> 01:15:21.190
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess men fit into that category too.</v>

1082
01:15:21.610 --> 01:15:26.610
<v Speaker 1>But her dream pretty much said that that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the proper place to sit and that</v>

1083
01:15:26.611 --> 01:15:28.930
<v Speaker 1>that was a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a very intelligent dream in that</v>

1084
01:15:28.931 --> 01:15:30.460
<v Speaker 1>regard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1085
01:15:30.461 --> 01:15:32.740
<v Speaker 1>So you temporary orderliness with</v>
<v Speaker 1>compassion.</v>

1086
01:15:32.741 --> 01:15:35.410
<v Speaker 1>Likely that'd be my guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1087
01:15:35.411 --> 01:15:37.810
<v Speaker 1>and that was certainly not something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that happened with the Nazis.</v>

1088
01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:41.650
<v Speaker 1>There was no compassion at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only the desire to exterminate and to,</v>

1089
01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:44.230
<v Speaker 1>and to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to kill.</v>

1090
01:15:46.410 --> 01:15:48.850
<v Speaker 1>All right guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll see you on</v>

1091
01:15:50.710 --> 01:15:52.100
<v Speaker 1>Tuesday one more week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kay.</v>

1092
01:15:53.130 --> 01:15:55.210
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
