1
00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:14.250
<v Speaker 1>I should tell you first about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>genesis of this theory,</v>

2
00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:17.020
<v Speaker 1>I suppose is the right way of putting </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

3
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.100
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.500
<v Speaker 1>when I was about your age,</v>

5
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.140
<v Speaker 2>that was back in the early eighties</v>

6
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:31.460
<v Speaker 1>or thereabouts.</v>

7
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:34.130
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

8
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.220
<v Speaker 1>and this was particularly true around </v>
<v Speaker 1>1984,</v>

9
00:00:38.221 --> 00:00:40.650
<v Speaker 1>but it was true before that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

10
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every generation has its worries,</v>

11
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.890
<v Speaker 1>real or imagined,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the primary worry for people of my </v>

12
00:00:50.701 --> 00:00:55.701
<v Speaker 1>generation was nuclear war and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a genuine worry.</v>

13
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.300
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at one point,</v>

14
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.360
<v Speaker 1>many years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went down to Arizona to visit an icbm,</v>

15
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.690
<v Speaker 1>a decommissioned icbm nuclear missile </v>
<v Speaker 1>silo.</v>

16
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.380
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ICBM intercontinental ballistic </v>

17
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.100
<v Speaker 1>missiles were very large rockets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

18
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.140
<v Speaker 1>They flew it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could fly halfway around the world,</v>

19
00:01:19.141 --> 00:01:22.800
<v Speaker 1>and it was deep underground and behind </v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

20
00:01:22.801 --> 00:01:25.860
<v Speaker 1>very thick steel doors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was light green,</v>

21
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.250
<v Speaker 1>pastel green that everyone seemed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>like in the 19 fifties was like pastel </v>

22
00:01:32.101 --> 00:01:35.610
<v Speaker 1>green star trek console.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it looked like.</v>

23
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.770
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

24
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.450
<v Speaker 1>so we went down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out in the yard,</v>

25
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.160
<v Speaker 1>was in the desert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out in the yard.</v>

26
00:01:41.161 --> 00:01:43.560
<v Speaker 1>There was a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

27
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.150
<v Speaker 1>magical object,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for lack of a better word,</v>

28
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.980
<v Speaker 1>and that was the nose cone for the IC I </v>
<v Speaker 1>icbm and it was quite big about that big</v>

29
00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.290
<v Speaker 1>boat out high pointed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the point of a bullet about three </v>

30
00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.990
<v Speaker 1>quarters of inch of an inch thick </v>
<v Speaker 1>plastic,</v>

31
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a kind of a resin and it was designed to</v>

32
00:02:08.841 --> 00:02:11.750
<v Speaker 1>melt on re-entry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was just sitting there.</v>

33
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.760
<v Speaker 1>So that was fairly thought provoking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's put it that way.</v>

34
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.480
<v Speaker 1>And then we went into the missile silo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interestingly enough,</v>

35
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.880
<v Speaker 1>appended to the front of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It had been decommissioned under Reagan </v>

36
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.880
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the front of it,</v>

37
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.100
<v Speaker 1>there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a museum with artifacts from the 19</v>

38
00:02:33.591 --> 00:02:38.591
<v Speaker 1>eighties featuring Reagan and Gorbachev </v>
<v Speaker 1>meeting multiple times and it was </v>

39
00:02:40.611 --> 00:02:45.611
<v Speaker 1>staffed by these southern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These Americans from the south who were </v>

40
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.100
<v Speaker 1>grandparent age and they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were just super friendly and you </v>

41
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.860
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were happy to be in the museum.</v>

42
00:02:51.861 --> 00:02:55.640
<v Speaker 1>It was like going to visit your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your grandma's nuclear missile silo.</v>

43
00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.860
<v Speaker 1>And so it was jarring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

44
00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>because it's obviously a</v>

45
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.370
<v Speaker 3>poor tentious place and yet it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>conjoined with hospitality and </v>

46
00:03:08.421 --> 00:03:11.660
<v Speaker 3>welcoming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was surreal in that manner.</v>

47
00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:13.820
<v Speaker 3>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we went into the,</v>

48
00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.560
<v Speaker 3>into the silo and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they ran us through a simulated launch.</v>

49
00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.160
<v Speaker 3>So imagine a panel like this made out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>metal except twice as long with another </v>

50
00:03:28.071 --> 00:03:31.430
<v Speaker 3>one of these things at the other end,</v>
<v Speaker 3>16 feet across or so,</v>

51
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.860
<v Speaker 3>basically 19 fifties technology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but updated.</v>

52
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.120
<v Speaker 3>And then imagine that what you had to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>to launch it was the,</v>

53
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.830
<v Speaker 3>there was a guy with a key and there was</v>
<v Speaker 3>another guy with a key,</v>

54
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.650
<v Speaker 3>and if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the keys were around their necks,</v>

55
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.350
<v Speaker 3>although I don't think they're restored </v>
<v Speaker 3>around their necks permanently.</v>

56
00:03:50.351 --> 00:03:52.600
<v Speaker 3>But.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so to launch the missile,</v>

57
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.200
<v Speaker 3>you had to put the key in the lock,</v>
<v Speaker 3>both of you.</v>

58
00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.770
<v Speaker 3>That was the safety precautions had to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be to have you put the key in the lock </v>

59
00:04:01.901 --> 00:04:05.800
<v Speaker 3>and hold it for 10 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then away the missile goes.</v>

60
00:04:05.801 --> 00:04:09.250
<v Speaker 3>And it wasn't as big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The missile wasn't as big as the rockets</v>

61
00:04:09.251 --> 00:04:12.910
<v Speaker 3>that went to the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it was plenty big,</v>

62
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the silo itself would have easily been </v>

63
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.350
<v Speaker 3>as wide as this room is and perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 3>larger and many,</v>

64
00:04:20.351 --> 00:04:21.730
<v Speaker 3>many stories tall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

65
00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:26.740
<v Speaker 3>because it was nested under ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they ran us through a simulated </v>

66
00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.740
<v Speaker 3>launch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was</v>

67
00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.500
<v Speaker 3>surreal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say.</v>

68
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.450
<v Speaker 3>And then they told us that someone asked</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they said the keys were in once.</v>

69
00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.680
<v Speaker 3>Now they wouldn't tell us when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

70
00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.280
<v Speaker 3>that would have been during the Cuban </v>
<v Speaker 3>missile crisis because we were that </v>

71
00:04:46.561 --> 00:04:50.610
<v Speaker 3>close and we were close again at other </v>
<v Speaker 3>times,</v>

72
00:04:50.611 --> 00:04:55.611
<v Speaker 3>although perhaps not that close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there seemed to be another peak of </v>

73
00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:01.670
<v Speaker 3>conflict in 1984 when there was a movie </v>
<v Speaker 3>showed at that time called the day </v>

74
00:05:03.541 --> 00:05:08.541
<v Speaker 3>after,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which at that time garnered more views </v>

75
00:05:08.541 --> 00:05:09.660
<v Speaker 3>than any movie ever had on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on TV.</v>

76
00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.780
<v Speaker 3>And it was a story about the aftermath </v>
<v Speaker 3>of a nuclear war and the people who were</v>

77
00:05:15.661 --> 00:05:20.661
<v Speaker 3>left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was pretty realistic and pretty </v>

78
00:05:20.661 --> 00:05:22.560
<v Speaker 3>frightening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it turned out,</v>

79
00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:28.460
<v Speaker 3>as I found out later that that movie </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually was one of the things that </v>

80
00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:33.110
<v Speaker 3>influenced Ronald Reagan to put pressure</v>
<v Speaker 3>on or negotiate with the Soviets.</v>

81
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:38.120
<v Speaker 3>Depending on how you look at it and so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

82
00:05:38.181 --> 00:05:38.670
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

83
00:05:38.671 --> 00:05:42.570
<v Speaker 3>five years later the Soviet Union </v>
<v Speaker 3>collapsed.</v>

84
00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.940
<v Speaker 3>No one saw that coming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

85
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.530
<v Speaker 3>and it really didn't collapse in 1989 in</v>
<v Speaker 3>some sense.</v>

86
00:05:49.531 --> 00:05:54.531
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a huge machine like that doesn't </v>

87
00:05:55.291 --> 00:05:57.830
<v Speaker 3>fall apart all at once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It falls apart over time.</v>

88
00:05:57.831 --> 00:05:58.220
<v Speaker 3>And then</v>

89
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.680
<v Speaker 1>at some point it just becomes an </v>
<v Speaker 1>unsustainable and topples and you know,</v>

90
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.930
<v Speaker 1>it's like they lost faith in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>doctrine and,</v>

91
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.170
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and for good reason.</v>

92
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:13.580
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that</v>

93
00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:19.330
<v Speaker 1>the system in Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Soviet Union,</v>

94
00:06:19.331 --> 00:06:24.331
<v Speaker 1>which was a collection of states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an empire and the system that was </v>

95
00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:29.850
<v Speaker 1>established in China and the system that</v>
<v Speaker 1>still exists in Korea as a remnant of </v>

96
00:06:30.791 --> 00:06:35.791
<v Speaker 1>the Cold War and systems in Southeast </v>
<v Speaker 1>Asia and in Africa were all predicated </v>

97
00:06:38.051 --> 00:06:43.051
<v Speaker 1>on Marxist presuppositions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Presuppositions that were Utopian in </v>

98
00:06:45.761 --> 00:06:46.300
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>

99
00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:47.390
<v Speaker 2>And that</v>

100
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:54.160
<v Speaker 1>posited a utopian future where property </v>
<v Speaker 1>was held in common and everyone had </v>

101
00:06:55.910 --> 00:07:00.910
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everyone was called upon to do what </v>

102
00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:04.001
<v Speaker 1>they could write from each according to </v>
<v Speaker 1>his ability to each according to his </v>

103
00:07:04.001 --> 00:07:06.020
<v Speaker 1>need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is a lovely sentiment.</v>

104
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:11.110
<v Speaker 1>And you can imagine how it would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>attractive even intellectually because </v>

105
00:07:11.151 --> 00:07:16.151
<v Speaker 1>of course other systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all other systems produce vast </v>

106
00:07:16.521 --> 00:07:21.521
<v Speaker 1>disparities in income.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a natural law that's actually </v>

107
00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:25.340
<v Speaker 1>governed by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can model it</v>

108
00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:32.630
<v Speaker 1>with a distribution called the </v>
<v Speaker 1>peritoneal distribution and the prieto </v>

109
00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:32.630
<v Speaker 1>distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like this.</v>

110
00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:34.980
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't look like a normal </v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution.</v>

111
00:07:34.981 --> 00:07:39.330
<v Speaker 1>A lot of you guys have been told about </v>
<v Speaker 1>normal distributions and how many things</v>

112
00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.870
<v Speaker 1>follow a normal distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most things,</v>

113
00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:47.990
<v Speaker 1>but that's really a limited case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can understand that prieto </v>

114
00:07:48.451 --> 00:07:49.530
<v Speaker 1>distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you.</v>

115
00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:55.160
<v Speaker 1>You've all played monopoly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I presume at the beginning everyone has </v>

116
00:07:55.441 --> 00:07:59.100
<v Speaker 1>the same amount of money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will include property,</v>

117
00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:04.160
<v Speaker 1>the same amount of wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then what happens as the game </v>

118
00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:04.410
<v Speaker 1>progresses and really as a function of </v>
<v Speaker 1>chance.</v>

119
00:08:04.411 --> 00:08:07.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean I know yet you have to use your </v>
<v Speaker 1>head a little bit monopoly,</v>

120
00:08:07.081 --> 00:08:12.081
<v Speaker 1>but the basic rule is just buy </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything you can get your hands on and</v>

121
00:08:12.511 --> 00:08:14.520
<v Speaker 1>then trade meanly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

122
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.060
<v Speaker 1>So at the beginning everybody has the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same amount.</v>

123
00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:22.510
<v Speaker 1>And then as you begin to play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you had enough players,</v>

124
00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:27.590
<v Speaker 1>you would develop an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a normal distribution because some </v>

125
00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:30.471
<v Speaker 1>people would win,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see relatively consistently and some </v>

126
00:08:30.471 --> 00:08:30.690
<v Speaker 1>people would lose relatively </v>
<v Speaker 1>consistently.</v>

127
00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:35.100
<v Speaker 1>And so the money starts to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>distributed in a normal distribution.</v>

128
00:08:35.101 --> 00:08:40.101
<v Speaker 1>But the thing about money and the thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>about lots of things is that zero is </v>

129
00:08:42.631 --> 00:08:47.631
<v Speaker 1>involved in zero is a weird place </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you're playing a trading game</v>

130
00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.810
<v Speaker 1>and you hit zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're done.</v>

131
00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:58.250
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's very hard to recover zero and </v>

132
00:08:58.250 --> 00:08:58.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard to recover.</v>

133
00:08:58.250 --> 00:08:59.670
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're doomed and monopoly,</v>

134
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can tell you've got some resources,</v>

135
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:07.880
<v Speaker 1>but there's going to be some crisis when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you land on some hotel and you're going </v>

136
00:09:08.161 --> 00:09:09.360
<v Speaker 1>to get wiped out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know it.</v>

137
00:09:09.361 --> 00:09:12.870
<v Speaker 1>So there's a point at which you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>headed for zero.</v>

138
00:09:12.871 --> 00:09:17.871
<v Speaker 1>Even if you have something you know and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you might be rescued by luck,</v>

139
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:27.710
<v Speaker 1>but you know when you're doomed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what happens is that as you continue </v>

140
00:09:28.051 --> 00:09:33.051
<v Speaker 1>to play monopoly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more and more people stack up at zero </v>

141
00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:37.020
<v Speaker 1>and fewer and fewer people have more and</v>
<v Speaker 1>more money.</v>

142
00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:42.740
<v Speaker 1>And when the game is over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone has nothing except one person </v>

143
00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:43.440
<v Speaker 1>and they have all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

144
00:09:43.441 --> 00:09:48.441
<v Speaker 1>the funny thing about that is that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense that's how trading games </v>

145
00:09:48.441 --> 00:09:49.170
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

146
00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.880
<v Speaker 1>you've got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might wonder why is that,</v>

147
00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:52.920
<v Speaker 1>why there is any quality in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>society?</v>

148
00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:58.250
<v Speaker 1>And it's easy to consider that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the society is corrupt and </v>

149
00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:01.920
<v Speaker 1>perhaps no society is ours somewhat or </v>
<v Speaker 1>horribly corrupt.</v>

150
00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:06.180
<v Speaker 1>That's the variation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no society that's without.</v>

151
00:10:06.181 --> 00:10:11.181
<v Speaker 1>It's criminal and criminal element and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fixed element anyways.</v>

152
00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:18.620
<v Speaker 1>Trading Games tend to produce a prieto </v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution so that very many people </v>

153
00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:22.200
<v Speaker 1>have very little and a tiny minority </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a tremendous amount.</v>

154
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:24.720
<v Speaker 1>That's the one percent that you hear </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

155
00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:26.460
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

156
00:10:26.461 --> 00:10:31.461
<v Speaker 1>the thing about that one percent is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's happened in every society that's </v>

157
00:10:31.461 --> 00:10:35.151
<v Speaker 1>ever been studied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't really matter what the </v>

158
00:10:35.151 --> 00:10:37.641
<v Speaker 1>governmental system is and it certainly </v>
<v Speaker 1>handled it certainly happened under the </v>

159
00:10:37.641 --> 00:10:37.641
<v Speaker 1>Soviets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

160
00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.230
<v Speaker 1>And there was a lot of people who had </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough zero,</v>

161
00:10:40.231 --> 00:10:44.310
<v Speaker 1>so they just died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

162
00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:49.320
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Utopian dream was completely </v>

163
00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:53.730
<v Speaker 1>unimplementable for a variety of very </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex reasons.</v>

164
00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:58.790
<v Speaker 1>One is that it's very hard to fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>against that distribution pattern when </v>

165
00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:03.180
<v Speaker 1>people are trading because mirror </v>
<v Speaker 1>statistics will do that and then there's</v>

166
00:11:03.181 --> 00:11:08.181
<v Speaker 1>other things that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I should tell you as well that the </v>

167
00:11:08.181 --> 00:11:08.310
<v Speaker 1>prieto distribution government governs a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of things,</v>

168
00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:13.340
<v Speaker 1>so if you look at books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I remember properly last year there </v>

169
00:11:14.341 --> 00:11:19.341
<v Speaker 1>was something like a million English </v>
<v Speaker 1>language books published and I think 500</v>

170
00:11:20.491 --> 00:11:22.620
<v Speaker 1>of them sold more than 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>copies,</v>

171
00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:23.910
<v Speaker 1>which is none,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

172
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:28.910
<v Speaker 1>That's none of that 500.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can be sure that one of them was by </v>

173
00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:32.751
<v Speaker 1>Stephen King and he took half the money </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's like five authors in the</v>

174
00:11:33.361 --> 00:11:37.560
<v Speaker 1>English language who are at on every </v>
<v Speaker 1>airport,</v>

175
00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:42.270
<v Speaker 1>paperback stand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>occupying the top rung.</v>

176
00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:43.890
<v Speaker 1>And that's massive real estate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

177
00:11:43.891 --> 00:11:48.870
<v Speaker 1>Because it's replicated everywhere and </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're so prominent and because</v>

178
00:11:48.871 --> 00:11:53.040
<v Speaker 1>there are no names when people are in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hurry and they just want something to.</v>

179
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.720
<v Speaker 1>They just grabbed that and then more </v>
<v Speaker 1>money goes to those people.</v>

180
00:11:55.721 --> 00:12:00.721
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>success breeds success and failure </v>

181
00:12:00.721 --> 00:12:02.440
<v Speaker 1>breeds failure and it's not necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>linear.</v>

182
00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:07.850
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a really difficult thing to deal </v>

183
00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:10.171
<v Speaker 1>with and it's hard on societies because </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things we do know is that,</v>

184
00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:17.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you stretch out the inequality you </v>

185
00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:19.390
<v Speaker 1>make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>men particularly on the lower end of the</v>

186
00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:22.540
<v Speaker 1>distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more and more likely to be aggressive.</v>

187
00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:26.260
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of like imagine every man has </v>
<v Speaker 1>a threshold for violence.</v>

188
00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:29.140
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and status is important to men.</v>

189
00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:32.830
<v Speaker 1>Not that it's not important to women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a different,</v>

190
00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:37.980
<v Speaker 1>it's a different kind of status.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's status is important to men because </v>

191
00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:41.611
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the things that makes them </v>
<v Speaker 1>marketable as partners to women's what </v>

192
00:12:41.611 --> 00:12:42.770
<v Speaker 1>actually turns out to be quite important</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the men.</v>

193
00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:46.540
<v Speaker 1>Men tend to compete with one another for</v>
<v Speaker 1>status,</v>

194
00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:50.800
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy position and in a really </v>
<v Speaker 1>unequal society.</v>

195
00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:56.340
<v Speaker 1>If you're like a low rung guy then and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have any opportunity to rise </v>

196
00:12:57.101 --> 00:13:01.690
<v Speaker 1>because the society isn't structured so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's mobility.</v>

197
00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:07.110
<v Speaker 1>Then the more aggressive guys tend to </v>
<v Speaker 1>turn into criminality and you know,</v>

198
00:13:08.021 --> 00:13:13.021
<v Speaker 1>and so you could say there's a threshold</v>
<v Speaker 1>for criminality and the more inequality </v>

199
00:13:13.721 --> 00:13:18.721
<v Speaker 1>pressure you put on a particular area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>geographic or political area,</v>

200
00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:21.490
<v Speaker 1>the more inequality pressure you put on </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

201
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.740
<v Speaker 1>the more men slip past that threshold </v>
<v Speaker 1>and into criminality.</v>

202
00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:29.230
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's been pretty good studies done of</v>

203
00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:33.550
<v Speaker 1>drug gang in Chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the best one.</v>

204
00:13:33.551 --> 00:13:36.400
<v Speaker 1>A sociologist actually went and hung out</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a drug gang for.</v>

205
00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:41.260
<v Speaker 1>He got into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess the drug gang leader was no,</v>

206
00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:47.940
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say necessarily narcissistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that might be a reasonable way of </v>

207
00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:51.961
<v Speaker 1>thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was kind of happy with the idea </v>

208
00:13:51.961 --> 00:13:55.981
<v Speaker 1>of maybe being a subject of a book and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so this guy was able to associate </v>

209
00:13:59.261 --> 00:14:00.880
<v Speaker 1>with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got to know them quite well.</v>

210
00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:06.360
<v Speaker 1>And then the housing project in which </v>
<v Speaker 1>the gang was housed was slated for </v>

211
00:14:06.521 --> 00:14:11.521
<v Speaker 1>demolition and the gang broke up and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>got the books because they kept books.</v>

212
00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:14.950
<v Speaker 1>And what he found was the average street</v>
<v Speaker 1>drug dealer,</v>

213
00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:18.550
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was employed in another job as well.</v>

214
00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:23.350
<v Speaker 1>And was making far less than minimum </v>
<v Speaker 1>wage now,</v>

215
00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:28.530
<v Speaker 1>but the guys further up the chain of </v>
<v Speaker 1>course followed the prieto distribution </v>

216
00:14:28.751 --> 00:14:33.751
<v Speaker 1>and so there was a tiny minority of them</v>
<v Speaker 1>who were raking in a tremendous amount </v>

217
00:14:33.751 --> 00:14:36.991
<v Speaker 1>of loot and the guys at the bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're just waiting around for the </v>

218
00:14:37.001 --> 00:14:40.420
<v Speaker 1>possibility that they could rise up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy and you know,</v>

219
00:14:40.421 --> 00:14:41.620
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty violent game.</v>

220
00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:46.620
<v Speaker 1>So the chances that someone is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be taken out is pretty high and then a </v>

221
00:14:48.971 --> 00:14:53.971
<v Speaker 1>little slot opens up for some </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunistic second rater and perhaps </v>

222
00:14:54.951 --> 00:14:59.951
<v Speaker 1>he can move up the hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the prieto distribution,</v>

223
00:15:03.751 --> 00:15:05.280
<v Speaker 1>governance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of other things too.</v>

224
00:15:05.281 --> 00:15:09.810
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned it governs the popularity of</v>
<v Speaker 1>books,</v>

225
00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:12.150
<v Speaker 1>the sales of books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also,</v>

226
00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:17.660
<v Speaker 1>it also characterizes the distribution </v>
<v Speaker 1>of everything that people produce.</v>

227
00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:23.520
<v Speaker 1>So if you think of creative production </v>
<v Speaker 1>of any sort of artistic production,</v>

228
00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:25.800
<v Speaker 1>industrial production,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter.</v>

229
00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:30.190
<v Speaker 1>Almost everything fails</v>

230
00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:36.110
<v Speaker 1>and a few things succeed beyond anyone's</v>
<v Speaker 1>wildest imagination.</v>

231
00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:38.390
<v Speaker 1>Apple's a good example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

232
00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:41.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean the iphone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have their competitors,</v>

233
00:15:41.991 --> 00:15:46.991
<v Speaker 1>but it's an extraordinarily dominant </v>
<v Speaker 1>product and they rake in billions of </v>

234
00:15:46.991 --> 00:15:51.490
<v Speaker 1>dollars I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if apple is valued at a </v>

235
00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:55.210
<v Speaker 1>trillion dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's close to that and that's a lot </v>

236
00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:56.120
<v Speaker 1>of money and I think if I remember </v>
<v Speaker 1>correctly,</v>

237
00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:59.240
<v Speaker 1>it's something like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably have the figures wrong,</v>

238
00:15:59.241 --> 00:16:04.241
<v Speaker 1>but like the top 40 people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the richest 40 people in the world have </v>

239
00:16:04.241 --> 00:16:06.320
<v Speaker 1>as much money as the bottom 2 billion </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

240
00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:11.350
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like they're stuffing their </v>

241
00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:11.900
<v Speaker 1>mattresses with that money or they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>a skyscraper full of cash.</v>

242
00:16:11.901 --> 00:16:16.520
<v Speaker 1>That money is out in the economy doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever money does.</v>

243
00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:20.510
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't spend $28,</v>

244
00:16:20.511 --> 00:16:22.490
<v Speaker 1>billion dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

245
00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:24.500
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes you can even do some good </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>

246
00:16:24.501 --> 00:16:29.501
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill Gates seems to be doing something </v>

247
00:16:29.501 --> 00:16:32.591
<v Speaker 1>reasonable with his money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the reason I'm telling you this is </v>

248
00:16:32.591 --> 00:16:35.951
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things you should </v>
<v Speaker 1>know is that this proclivity for </v>

249
00:16:36.591 --> 00:16:41.591
<v Speaker 1>inequality is pervasive among the </v>
<v Speaker 1>creative products of human beings.</v>

250
00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:45.320
<v Speaker 1>It's the case with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with goals scored in hockey.</v>

251
00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:50.620
<v Speaker 1>My son told me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's a reliable source on hockey </v>

252
00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:50.620
<v Speaker 1>statistics that</v>

253
00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:56.360
<v Speaker 1>if Wayne Gretzky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't count any of the points </v>

254
00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:58.821
<v Speaker 1>that Wayne Gretzky managed with scoring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he still had enough points just with </v>

255
00:16:59.011 --> 00:17:02.160
<v Speaker 1>assists to have more points than any </v>
<v Speaker 1>hockey player that ever played.</v>

256
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you even at the upper end of of of the </v>

257
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.490
<v Speaker 1>distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some person who's hot.</v>

258
00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:15.580
<v Speaker 1>They're so good at what they do and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's another person that's so much </v>

259
00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:18.090
<v Speaker 1>better than them that it's not even </v>
<v Speaker 1>comparable and so.</v>

260
00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:22.080
<v Speaker 1>And the benefits flow to people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>in that position.</v>

261
00:17:22.081 --> 00:17:27.081
<v Speaker 1>And you can understand why I would say </v>
<v Speaker 1>because now let's say you start writing </v>

262
00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:32.450
<v Speaker 1>and you get a book and a rare things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very rare things to have happened.</v>

263
00:17:32.791 --> 00:17:34.410
<v Speaker 1>And then some people read it and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>like it.</v>

264
00:17:34.411 --> 00:17:37.410
<v Speaker 1>And then of course it's much more likely</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you'll get a next book.</v>

265
00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:42.800
<v Speaker 1>And if people like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while it's even more likely that you'll </v>

266
00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:42.800
<v Speaker 1>get a third book and then people start </v>
<v Speaker 1>to know who you are.</v>

267
00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:47.780
<v Speaker 1>And then because they know who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They phone you up and offer you </v>

268
00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:50.691
<v Speaker 1>opportunities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And your network grows and it's like </v>

269
00:17:50.691 --> 00:17:53.360
<v Speaker 1>this exponential increase in your reach </v>
<v Speaker 1>and your capacity for production and </v>

270
00:17:55.560 --> 00:18:00.540
<v Speaker 1>more and more flows to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then on the other hand,</v>

271
00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:04.920
<v Speaker 1>if you start to fail and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would someone fail?</v>

272
00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:07.030
<v Speaker 1>Well God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

273
00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:13.520
<v Speaker 1>one idea that's very common in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture is that poverty is caused by </v>

274
00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:17.001
<v Speaker 1>lack of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a really stupid idea because </v>

275
00:18:17.001 --> 00:18:20.901
<v Speaker 1>money is very difficult to handle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had clients who were drug addicts and </v>

276
00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:26.330
<v Speaker 1>the worst possible thing that could </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen to them was that they got some </v>

277
00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:26.940
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just done.</v>

278
00:18:26.941 --> 00:18:27.690
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

279
00:18:27.691 --> 00:18:32.610
<v Speaker 1>they were hanging around with people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>were little on the sociopathic side.</v>

280
00:18:32.611 --> 00:18:37.611
<v Speaker 1>And so especially if they weren't that </v>
<v Speaker 1>bright and couldn't defend themselves </v>

281
00:18:37.611 --> 00:18:42.141
<v Speaker 1>very well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as they got money while it was </v>

282
00:18:42.141 --> 00:18:42.141
<v Speaker 1>off to the bar with all the friends.</v>

283
00:18:42.141 --> 00:18:45.420
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one guy I remember in particular,</v>

284
00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:50.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time he got as his disability </v>

285
00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:52.080
<v Speaker 1>check,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was gone for five days,</v>

286
00:18:52.081 --> 00:18:54.150
<v Speaker 1>usually fondom in a ditch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

287
00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:59.170
<v Speaker 1>cause he just go to the bar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spent every Saturday had on alcohol and </v>

288
00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:04.940
<v Speaker 1>cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And wake up in a ditch three quarters </v>

289
00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:08.640
<v Speaker 1>dead eventually completely did and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

290
00:19:08.851 --> 00:19:13.851
<v Speaker 1>then he was ashamed and horrified and </v>
<v Speaker 1>repentant and he'd straightened himself </v>

291
00:19:15.001 --> 00:19:20.001
<v Speaker 1>out again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that was all well and good </v>

292
00:19:20.001 --> 00:19:22.131
<v Speaker 1>until,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as he was broke until the next </v>

293
00:19:22.131 --> 00:19:22.560
<v Speaker 1>check showed up and then bang the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

294
00:19:22.561 --> 00:19:27.561
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like money is necessarily a </v>

295
00:19:27.561 --> 00:19:29.430
<v Speaker 1>good for everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard managed money.</v>

296
00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:34.760
<v Speaker 1>It's really easy for it to disappear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean elderly people have a hell of a </v>

297
00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:37.911
<v Speaker 1>time now because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crooks are contacting them on the </v>

298
00:19:37.911 --> 00:19:40.830
<v Speaker 1>Internet nonstop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so just giving people money,</v>

299
00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:46.690
<v Speaker 1>money's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like pouring water in their hands </v>

300
00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:46.690
<v Speaker 1>is not that helpful.</v>

301
00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:50.930
<v Speaker 1>Not necessarily that helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then of course contributors to </v>

302
00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:52.560
<v Speaker 1>poverty are well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not so good to have a low Iq.</v>

303
00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:57.030
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't like the idea of Iq because</v>

304
00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:59.460
<v Speaker 1>it seems so arbitrary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

305
00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:02.520
<v Speaker 1>have a high Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's not like you deserved that.</v>

306
00:20:02.521 --> 00:20:07.521
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's your setup that way pretty much </v>

307
00:20:07.521 --> 00:20:07.521
<v Speaker 1>right from the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very,</v>

308
00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:08.640
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

309
00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:12.420
<v Speaker 1>very stable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can make a high Iq person stupider.</v>

310
00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:13.630
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

311
00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:16.080
<v Speaker 1>not educating them up to the level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their possibility,</v>

312
00:20:16.081 --> 00:20:19.470
<v Speaker 1>but taking someone who has a low Iq and </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to raise that.</v>

313
00:20:19.471 --> 00:20:21.330
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you can figure out how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do that,</v>

314
00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:26.780
<v Speaker 1>well you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobel prize time for you because people </v>

315
00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:28.650
<v Speaker 1>have tried that a lot and most recently </v>
<v Speaker 1>with those,</v>

316
00:20:28.651 --> 00:20:33.651
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luminol lumosity games and that sort of </v>

317
00:20:33.651 --> 00:20:35.961
<v Speaker 1>thing and the evidence that those </v>
<v Speaker 1>produce anything other than brilliant </v>

318
00:20:36.511 --> 00:20:41.400
<v Speaker 1>performances on the lumosity game itself</v>
<v Speaker 1>is basically zero.</v>

319
00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:46.550
<v Speaker 1>We haven't been able to figure out how </v>
<v Speaker 1>to see because intelligence is across </v>

320
00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:51.440
<v Speaker 1>domain phenomena and you can get really </v>
<v Speaker 1>good in a single domain by practicing </v>

321
00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:56.131
<v Speaker 1>like mad and what you'd want is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>practice like matt in a single domain </v>

322
00:20:56.131 --> 00:20:57.910
<v Speaker 1>and hope that it generalized to other </v>
<v Speaker 1>domains.</v>

323
00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:00.820
<v Speaker 1>That's the holy grail of intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 1>increase.</v>

324
00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:01.870
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

325
00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:07.890
<v Speaker 1>no one's done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People claim it but the claims never </v>

326
00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:11.041
<v Speaker 1>hold up and people have been trying for </v>
<v Speaker 1>a long time to do it and they haven't </v>

327
00:21:11.041 --> 00:21:11.680
<v Speaker 1>been able to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

328
00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:18.880
<v Speaker 1>differences in Iq really make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>

329
00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:19.660
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

330
00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:25.890
<v Speaker 1>you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>average Iq is probably one slash 25 </v>

331
00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:29.200
<v Speaker 1>slash 30 ad at 1:15</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're at the 85th percentile and 1:15</v>

332
00:21:32.021 --> 00:21:35.650
<v Speaker 1>would barely get you going for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For Harvard University,</v>

333
00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:40.000
<v Speaker 1>1:30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're probably graduate school material</v>

334
00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:45.310
<v Speaker 1>1:45.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're up there at the range where you </v>

335
00:21:46.001 --> 00:21:47.620
<v Speaker 1>can probably do pretty much whatever you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>

336
00:21:47.621 --> 00:21:52.621
<v Speaker 1>Although as you get smarter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the scatter between your abilities </v>

337
00:21:52.621 --> 00:21:56.251
<v Speaker 1>increase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might have a very high verbal Iq </v>

338
00:21:56.251 --> 00:21:56.350
<v Speaker 1>but not be so good at mathematics or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other way around,</v>

339
00:21:56.890 --> 00:22:01.890
<v Speaker 1>but it's a massive contributor to </v>
<v Speaker 1>lifetime success and I don't know what </v>

340
00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:07.770
<v Speaker 1>to do about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean why do smart people make more </v>

341
00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:07.900
<v Speaker 1>money?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

342
00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:13.230
<v Speaker 1>they get to where the edge of production</v>
<v Speaker 1>is faster.</v>

343
00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:17.230
<v Speaker 1>So if you have a thousand people and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>rank order them by ICU,</v>

344
00:22:17.231 --> 00:22:22.231
<v Speaker 1>the smart people are going to come up </v>
<v Speaker 1>with new ideas first and they're going </v>

345
00:22:22.231 --> 00:22:23.740
<v Speaker 1>to have more ideas and they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>strategize better.</v>

346
00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:27.490
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with an Iq of 90,</v>

347
00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:32.850
<v Speaker 1>which is 15 percent of the population,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think about that 15 percent of the </v>

348
00:22:35.281 --> 00:22:40.281
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty much the threshold for </v>

349
00:22:40.281 --> 00:22:41.310
<v Speaker 1>reading instructions and being able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>follow them.</v>

350
00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:48.350
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and our society is increasingly </v>

351
00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:50.310
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated so it's by no means </v>
<v Speaker 1>obvious,</v>

352
00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:52.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the liberals think,</v>

353
00:22:52.651 --> 00:22:53.010
<v Speaker 1>well</v>

354
00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:53.980
<v Speaker 2>hmm,</v>

355
00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:58.410
<v Speaker 1>the society is unfair because there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>unemployment and the Conservatives think</v>

356
00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:02.070
<v Speaker 1>while there's a job for everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but none of them think,</v>

357
00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:03.960
<v Speaker 1>well there are massive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>massive,</v>

358
00:23:03.961 --> 00:23:08.700
<v Speaker 1>massive differences in people's ability </v>
<v Speaker 1>far greater than anyone realizes.</v>

359
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:14.000
<v Speaker 1>And that poses a structural problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a client and I got him a volunteer</v>

360
00:23:15.931 --> 00:23:18.030
<v Speaker 1>job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is way harder than you think.</v>

361
00:23:18.031 --> 00:23:23.031
<v Speaker 1>You need a police check for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's harder to get a volunteer job </v>

362
00:23:23.031 --> 00:23:25.470
<v Speaker 1>than a real job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I regard them in a volunteer job and</v>

363
00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:29.010
<v Speaker 1>he had to fold pieces of paper letters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>

364
00:23:29.011 --> 00:23:34.011
<v Speaker 1>He worked at a charity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had to full pieces of paper in three </v>

365
00:23:34.011 --> 00:23:35.250
<v Speaker 1>so that he could put them inside </v>
<v Speaker 1>envelopes and,</v>

366
00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:41.950
<v Speaker 1>and then the letters which were in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pile had to be matched with the proper </v>

367
00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:42.950
<v Speaker 1>envelopes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we're also in a pile,</v>

368
00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:45.080
<v Speaker 1>but some of them were French and some of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wrangling.</v>

369
00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:49.430
<v Speaker 1>So the French ones had to be matched </v>
<v Speaker 1>carefully to the French envelopes and,</v>

370
00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:51.050
<v Speaker 1>and then if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

371
00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:54.620
<v Speaker 1>if there was one envelope out of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of order,</v>

372
00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:58.400
<v Speaker 1>well then he had to figure out whether </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the papers that were out of order</v>

373
00:23:58.401 --> 00:24:03.401
<v Speaker 1>or the letters that were out of order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then some of the letters had </v>

374
00:24:04.071 --> 00:24:07.930
<v Speaker 1>photographs attached to them and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't supposed to bend the photographs</v>

375
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.590
<v Speaker 1>but they weren't always in the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

376
00:24:09.591 --> 00:24:14.591
<v Speaker 1>So that meant you had to figure out how </v>
<v Speaker 1>to fold the paper in three a bunch of </v>

377
00:24:14.841 --> 00:24:17.420
<v Speaker 1>different ways without creasing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>photograph.</v>

378
00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:22.790
<v Speaker 1>And then the other thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I never realized how difficult it is</v>

379
00:24:22.791 --> 00:24:27.791
<v Speaker 1>to put a piece of paper and an envelope </v>
<v Speaker 1>till I watched someone who couldn't do </v>

380
00:24:27.791 --> 00:24:30.500
<v Speaker 1>it and he probably had an Iq of about </v>
<v Speaker 1>80.</v>

381
00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:32.120
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you met him on the street,</v>

382
00:24:32.121 --> 00:24:34.460
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't think anything different of</v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

383
00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:38.210
<v Speaker 1>It was normal looking guy had some other</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>

384
00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:43.910
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I trained him to fold those damn papers </v>

385
00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:46.550
<v Speaker 1>for like 30 hours and he got reasonably </v>
<v Speaker 1>good at it.</v>

386
00:24:46.551 --> 00:24:51.551
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're good at it and you probably </v>

387
00:24:51.551 --> 00:24:55.811
<v Speaker 1>all are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fold it and the edges line up </v>

388
00:24:55.811 --> 00:24:56.900
<v Speaker 1>exactly like really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

389
00:24:56.901 --> 00:24:59.510
<v Speaker 1>The tolerance is probably half a </v>
<v Speaker 1>millimeter or something like that.</v>

390
00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:03.500
<v Speaker 1>Then you do the second fold and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tolerance is the same.</v>

391
00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:06.620
<v Speaker 1>But let's imagine that the first full </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

392
00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:09.650
<v Speaker 1>you're out by an eighth of an inch in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the second full year out by an eighth of</v>

393
00:25:09.651 --> 00:25:11.540
<v Speaker 1>an inch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a little crooked.</v>

394
00:25:11.650 --> 00:25:14.300
<v Speaker 1>Not means in totally route by a quarter </v>
<v Speaker 1>of an inch.</v>

395
00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:20.200
<v Speaker 1>Then it won't fit in the damn envelope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you kind of crumpled the </v>

396
00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:23.251
<v Speaker 1>envelope when you put it in there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then it gets stuck in the sorting </v>

397
00:25:23.251 --> 00:25:23.251
<v Speaker 1>machine.</v>

398
00:25:23.251 --> 00:25:27.400
<v Speaker 1>And so he sweated blood trying to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that job and eventually eventually plan </v>

399
00:25:30.141 --> 00:25:33.290
<v Speaker 1>to fire him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine what that's like a,</v>

400
00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:39.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't get a job and then so you get </v>

401
00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:42.761
<v Speaker 1>a job at a charity as a volunteer and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>charity decides to fire you.</v>

402
00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:46.400
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean really that's just.</v>

403
00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:52.150
<v Speaker 1>So I talked to the woman who was running</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and suggested that that might be a </v>

404
00:25:56.211 --> 00:25:58.160
<v Speaker 1>little on the devastating side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

405
00:25:58.161 --> 00:26:00.410
<v Speaker 1>she had her reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

406
00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:02.090
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

407
00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:06.560
<v Speaker 1>he was always asking people questions </v>
<v Speaker 1>about how to do his job and you know,</v>

408
00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:11.590
<v Speaker 1>so that meant he was interfering with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the productivity of other people and it </v>

409
00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:11.720
<v Speaker 1>was genuine interference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

410
00:26:11.721 --> 00:26:16.721
<v Speaker 1>she wasn't being mean and it was her job</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make sure the place did what it was </v>

411
00:26:16.721 --> 00:26:17.750
<v Speaker 1>supposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

412
00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:21.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was between a rock and a hard place.</v>

413
00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:27.630
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he eventually decided that the job </v>

414
00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:30.851
<v Speaker 1>wasn't for him and relatively soon after</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I think it was too stressful and </v>

415
00:26:31.341 --> 00:26:33.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he quit.</v>

416
00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:36.950
<v Speaker 1>So that solved that problem except in he</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't have job,</v>

417
00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:39.060
<v Speaker 1>which of course is a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

418
00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:41.840
<v Speaker 1>it has a happy ending.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This story,</v>

419
00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:43.840
<v Speaker 1>as far as I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

420
00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:47.970
<v Speaker 1>he got a dog because he was very </v>
<v Speaker 1>lonesome.</v>

421
00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:50.910
<v Speaker 1>And that dog man have not guy trained </v>
<v Speaker 1>that dog.</v>

422
00:26:50.911 --> 00:26:55.911
<v Speaker 1>That was something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That dog just think he lost 30 pounds </v>

423
00:26:55.911 --> 00:26:55.911
<v Speaker 1>while he was training that dog because </v>
<v Speaker 1>dogs,</v>

424
00:26:55.911 --> 00:26:56.250
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

425
00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:59.760
<v Speaker 1>dominant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he had to have a tussle with the dog</v>

426
00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:03.030
<v Speaker 1>to figure out who was in charge and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of responsibility to have a dog,</v>

427
00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:05.430
<v Speaker 1>but he was pretty damn committed to that</v>
<v Speaker 1>dog.</v>

428
00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:10.940
<v Speaker 1>And he managed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The things he went through to keep that </v>

429
00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:11.160
<v Speaker 1>dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just cannot possibly imagine.</v>

430
00:27:11.161 --> 00:27:12.930
<v Speaker 1>It's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a,</v>

431
00:27:14.810 --> 00:27:16.710
<v Speaker 1>it's like a surreal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was surreal.</v>

432
00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:19.110
<v Speaker 1>Just like the nuclear missile silo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

433
00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:23.250
<v Speaker 1>he had people following him around </v>
<v Speaker 1>informing on him because they thought he</v>

434
00:27:23.251 --> 00:27:28.251
<v Speaker 1>was abusing the dog when in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I watched the dog was clearly </v>

435
00:27:28.251 --> 00:27:29.040
<v Speaker 1>abusive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

436
00:27:30.390 --> 00:27:35.260
<v Speaker 1>so he got a job helping a woman who </v>
<v Speaker 1>trained dogs and,</v>

437
00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:38.430
<v Speaker 1>and then he had a job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Hooray,</v>

438
00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:42.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was like a miracle fundamentally.</v>

439
00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:47.600
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason I'm telling you all this is </v>

440
00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:50.871
<v Speaker 1>because there was a reason for the Cold </v>
<v Speaker 1>War and the reason was that there's </v>

441
00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:56.790
<v Speaker 1>inequality and there's different </v>
<v Speaker 1>theories about how to address that </v>

442
00:27:56.790 --> 00:27:58.770
<v Speaker 1>inequality and different theories about </v>
<v Speaker 1>why it exists.</v>

443
00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:02.790
<v Speaker 1>And there was a Marxist theory about why</v>
<v Speaker 1>it exists,</v>

444
00:28:02.791 --> 00:28:05.970
<v Speaker 1>which was roughly something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>property equals theft.</v>

445
00:28:05.971 --> 00:28:09.390
<v Speaker 1>And those who have more have taken it </v>
<v Speaker 1>from those who have less,</v>

446
00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:11.240
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

447
00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:15.390
<v Speaker 1>seems to me to eliminate any conceptual </v>
<v Speaker 1>than that.</v>

448
00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:18.360
<v Speaker 1>There isn't a fixed pot of money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

449
00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:22.710
<v Speaker 1>money expands actually as we become more</v>
<v Speaker 1>technologically proficient.</v>

450
00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:28.310
<v Speaker 1>And lots of people who have money have </v>
<v Speaker 1>it because they've generated a lot of </v>

451
00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:28.980
<v Speaker 1>wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

452
00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:31.350
<v Speaker 1>Bill Gates is a great example of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

453
00:28:31.351 --> 00:28:34.500
<v Speaker 1>He popularized computing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He made it possible for everybody to,</v>

454
00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:37.050
<v Speaker 1>to have access to computing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

455
00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:40.260
<v Speaker 1>seems like a good good for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

456
00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:45.560
<v Speaker 1>And you could say the same thing about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve jobs and maybe you'll be able to </v>

457
00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:46.080
<v Speaker 1>say the same thing about Elon Musk and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

458
00:28:46.081 --> 00:28:48.720
<v Speaker 1>these guys have tremendous resources out</v>
<v Speaker 1>their disposal,</v>

459
00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:52.080
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not like,</v>

460
00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:56.280
<v Speaker 1>they're not bathing in bank notes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

461
00:28:56.281 --> 00:29:01.281
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to continue to do things </v>

462
00:29:01.281 --> 00:29:04.611
<v Speaker 1>and they use their money to do things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And anyways,</v>

463
00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:12.280
<v Speaker 1>the Russians set themselves up under </v>
<v Speaker 1>Marxists presuppositions and tried to </v>

464
00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:18.710
<v Speaker 1>equalize the distribution of property </v>
<v Speaker 1>and to call that catastrophic,</v>

465
00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:24.500
<v Speaker 1>barely scratches the surface.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know that you guys probably don't </v>

466
00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:28.020
<v Speaker 1>learn much about this because for some </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason people aren't taught about it,</v>

467
00:29:28.021 --> 00:29:28.290
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

468
00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:30.330
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

469
00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:37.430
<v Speaker 1>the good estimates are that the Russians</v>
<v Speaker 1>killed about 30 million of their own </v>

470
00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:38.160
<v Speaker 1>people between 19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>19 in 1959,</v>

471
00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:39.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

472
00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:43.090
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's brutal.</v>

473
00:29:43.091 --> 00:29:44.620
<v Speaker 1>A lot of that with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through starvation.</v>

474
00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:47.980
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw a photograph the other day which I</v>

475
00:29:47.981 --> 00:29:52.981
<v Speaker 1>tweeted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the worst photograph I've ever </v>

476
00:29:52.981 --> 00:29:52.981
<v Speaker 1>seen in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's actually saying a lot because</v>

477
00:29:52.981 --> 00:29:57.900
<v Speaker 1>I've seen a lot of really terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>photographs because I've done so much </v>

478
00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:01.771
<v Speaker 1>investigation into totalitarianism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was a photograph that was taken </v>

479
00:30:01.771 --> 00:30:05.610
<v Speaker 1>during one of the early starvation </v>
<v Speaker 1>periods in,</v>

480
00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:08.170
<v Speaker 1>in the Soviet Union were about 3 million</v>
<v Speaker 1>peasants died.</v>

481
00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:13.380
<v Speaker 1>It was a picture of a peasant couple </v>
<v Speaker 1>standing behind a table at a market </v>

482
00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:15.820
<v Speaker 1>selling human body parts for food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

483
00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:17.980
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have this weird quirk,</v>

484
00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:24.420
<v Speaker 1>which I don't think does me much good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe helps me understand things </v>

485
00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:28.750
<v Speaker 1>better when I see that someone has done </v>
<v Speaker 1>something extreme.</v>

486
00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:34.950
<v Speaker 1>I learned to do this a long time ago </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I worked briefly in a maximum </v>

487
00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:37.960
<v Speaker 1>security prison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try to imagine what I would have to be</v>

488
00:30:37.961 --> 00:30:42.961
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of situation I would have to </v>

489
00:30:42.961 --> 00:30:43.720
<v Speaker 1>find myself in to do that and believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

490
00:30:43.721 --> 00:30:45.520
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a horrifying enter.</v>

491
00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:49.510
<v Speaker 1>That's a horrifying enterprise because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is actually possible.</v>

492
00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:54.780
<v Speaker 1>No matter what it is that you read about</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone doing and no matter how unlikely</v>

493
00:30:54.821 --> 00:30:59.821
<v Speaker 1>it is that you think you would do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's possible to imagine yourself in </v>

494
00:31:01.181 --> 00:31:02.260
<v Speaker 1>that situation</v>

495
00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:03.310
<v Speaker 2>and that.</v>

496
00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:07.140
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's enlightening.</v>

497
00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:08.940
<v Speaker 1>That's what I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's enlightening.</v>

498
00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:14.230
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things about </v>

499
00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:15.771
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment is is that you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightened by doing things that are </v>

500
00:31:17.711 --> 00:31:19.690
<v Speaker 1>necessary that you really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

501
00:31:19.691 --> 00:31:24.691
<v Speaker 1>really do not want to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to do and imagine </v>

502
00:31:24.691 --> 00:31:29.460
<v Speaker 1>imagining yourself as a perpetrator of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort is that tells you something </v>

503
00:31:30.311 --> 00:31:32.650
<v Speaker 1>about the world and that tells you </v>
<v Speaker 1>something about human beings.</v>

504
00:31:32.651 --> 00:31:36.700
<v Speaker 1>But it's a hell of a thing to swallow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

505
00:31:36.701 --> 00:31:41.701
<v Speaker 1>and in a very well structured society </v>
<v Speaker 1>like ours where were so peaceful while.</v>

506
00:31:44.261 --> 00:31:49.261
<v Speaker 1>Because we have the heat and it always </v>
<v Speaker 1>works and we have electricity and it </v>

507
00:31:49.261 --> 00:31:51.100
<v Speaker 1>always works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we have plumbing,</v>

508
00:31:51.101 --> 00:31:54.520
<v Speaker 1>which is a bloody miracle and it always </v>
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>

509
00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:59.880
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just one of the things that this </v>

510
00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:01.510
<v Speaker 1>imagination process has done for me is </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep me alert</v>

511
00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:08.370
<v Speaker 1>to the absolute miracle that my life is </v>
<v Speaker 1>every day.</v>

512
00:32:08.850 --> 00:32:12.210
<v Speaker 1>It's horribly cold out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't grow any food.</v>

513
00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:15.630
<v Speaker 1>You die if you're out there for 24 </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours.</v>

514
00:32:16.530 --> 00:32:20.430
<v Speaker 1>If any of this infrastructure was </v>
<v Speaker 1>unreliable for any length of time,</v>

515
00:32:20.431 --> 00:32:24.360
<v Speaker 1>we would be in serious trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's never unreliable.</v>

516
00:32:25.050 --> 00:32:30.050
<v Speaker 1>It's so unlikely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so here we are with all this </v>

517
00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:32.760
<v Speaker 1>reliable infrastructure and because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

518
00:32:32.761 --> 00:32:34.950
<v Speaker 1>we don't really have to compete with </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other much.</v>

519
00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:38.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some you don't compete for food,</v>

520
00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:40.550
<v Speaker 1>you don't compete for shelter or some </v>
<v Speaker 1>people do,</v>

521
00:32:40.551 --> 00:32:43.910
<v Speaker 1>but not very many.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's really easy to think of yourself</v>

522
00:32:43.911 --> 00:32:46.120
<v Speaker 1>as good because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

523
00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:50.240
<v Speaker 1>you're not doing anything nasty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Danny one.</v>

524
00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:52.430
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cynic might say,</v>

525
00:32:52.431 --> 00:32:54.920
<v Speaker 1>well that's just because you don't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>any reason to.</v>

526
00:32:56.180 --> 00:33:00.110
<v Speaker 1>But those reasons have arisen many times</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the past,</v>

527
00:33:00.111 --> 00:33:04.120
<v Speaker 1>and in fact they're the norm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the exception.</v>

528
00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:09.220
<v Speaker 1>We're the exception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This insanely functional society that </v>

529
00:33:10.330 --> 00:33:15.330
<v Speaker 1>we've somehow managed to generate is </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's incomprehensible to me that it </v>

530
00:33:16.311 --> 00:33:21.311
<v Speaker 1>exists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

531
00:33:26.770 --> 00:33:29.620
<v Speaker 1>back in the industrial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the industrial revolution,</v>

532
00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:32.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the conditions of the worker were pretty</v>

533
00:33:32.141 --> 00:33:33.340
<v Speaker 1>brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

534
00:33:33.341 --> 00:33:36.430
<v Speaker 1>George Orwell wrote a book called road </v>
<v Speaker 1>to Wigan Pier,</v>

535
00:33:36.431 --> 00:33:38.860
<v Speaker 1>which I would highly recommend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a great book.</v>

536
00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:44.520
<v Speaker 1>And he went up in the thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was the thirties to work to </v>

537
00:33:45.251 --> 00:33:48.310
<v Speaker 1>live with the coal miners up in northern</v>
<v Speaker 1>northern uk.</v>

538
00:33:48.670 --> 00:33:51.210
<v Speaker 1>And those poor guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

539
00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:56.280
<v Speaker 1>they had to crawl to work for two miles </v>
<v Speaker 1>down a tunnel that they couldn't stand </v>

540
00:33:56.280 --> 00:34:00.661
<v Speaker 1>up in just to start their shift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then after their eight hours of,</v>

541
00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:03.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hacking away at the coal walls,</v>

542
00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:06.490
<v Speaker 1>which is rather difficult and dirty and </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous.</v>

543
00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:08.740
<v Speaker 1>And of course you get black lung from </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

544
00:34:08.741 --> 00:34:13.741
<v Speaker 1>So it's also fatal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course they didn't get paid very </v>

545
00:34:13.741 --> 00:34:13.741
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So after doing that for eight hours,</v>

546
00:34:13.741 --> 00:34:18.010
<v Speaker 1>then you crawled back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're two miles and you didn't get paid</v>

547
00:34:18.011 --> 00:34:18.340
<v Speaker 1>for that.</v>

548
00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:20.530
<v Speaker 1>That was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was just the commute.</v>

549
00:34:21.430 --> 00:34:24.280
<v Speaker 1>And the housing for those people was not</v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

550
00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:29.340
<v Speaker 1>The food wasn't good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of them had no teeth by the time </v>

551
00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:29.340
<v Speaker 1>they were 30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

552
00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:30.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being poor was no joke.</v>

553
00:34:30.071 --> 00:34:33.160
<v Speaker 1>Even in a place like the UK,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was relatively well off.</v>

554
00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:38.400
<v Speaker 1>And so there was every reason to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned about the disparity between </v>

555
00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:40.960
<v Speaker 1>rich and poor and poor is the natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>

556
00:34:40.961 --> 00:34:42.940
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that in the Western world,</v>

557
00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:44.620
<v Speaker 1>in 18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>95,</v>

558
00:34:44.621 --> 00:34:48.280
<v Speaker 1>the typical person lived on a dollar a </v>
<v Speaker 1>day in today's dollars.</v>

559
00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:54.000
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not uncommon in many places in </v>

560
00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.751
<v Speaker 1>the world now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there were reasons to be concerned </v>

561
00:34:57.761 --> 00:34:59.590
<v Speaker 1>with inequality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

562
00:34:59.591 --> 00:35:04.591
<v Speaker 1>the Russians took one pathway inspired </v>
<v Speaker 1>by Marx and we took another pathway </v>

563
00:35:05.110 --> 00:35:10.110
<v Speaker 1>inspired by John Stuart Mill and John </v>
<v Speaker 1>Locke and the English tradition,</v>

564
00:35:11.021 --> 00:35:16.021
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of democracy and competed for 70 years.</v>

565
00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:21.800
<v Speaker 1>And things seemed to have worked out </v>
<v Speaker 1>better here.</v>

566
00:35:22.970 --> 00:35:27.970
<v Speaker 1>But it was a hell of a competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there were real differences in </v>

567
00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:32.471
<v Speaker 1>opinion at the bottom of it and those </v>
<v Speaker 1>two systems turned into armed camps.</v>

568
00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:34.970
<v Speaker 1>And that's not over exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

569
00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:41.310
<v Speaker 1>There's the Chinese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole a hybrid now between communism</v>

570
00:35:41.311 --> 00:35:46.311
<v Speaker 1>and capitalism and hopefully they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>more interested in getting rich than </v>

571
00:35:46.311 --> 00:35:46.311
<v Speaker 1>they are in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

572
00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:50.700
<v Speaker 1>having a war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Greed is a good motivator.</v>

573
00:35:50.770 --> 00:35:53.460
<v Speaker 1>A surprisingly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of reliable.</v>

574
00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:57.720
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by 1989,</v>

575
00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:03.560
<v Speaker 1>the Jig was up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was obvious that the Soviet system </v>

576
00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:06.030
<v Speaker 1>could not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was not functional.</v>

577
00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:09.510
<v Speaker 1>There was no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no consumer goods,</v>

578
00:36:09.890 --> 00:36:14.890
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even in the main department stores and </v>

579
00:36:14.890 --> 00:36:14.890
<v Speaker 1>in Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Moscow,</v>

580
00:36:14.890 --> 00:36:17.910
<v Speaker 1>and people just kind of lost faith in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole project.</v>

581
00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:21.120
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it became her for awhile.</v>

582
00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:26.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you know about the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dallas Dallas was a soap opera that ran </v>

583
00:36:26.341 --> 00:36:28.910
<v Speaker 1>at night a cereal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

584
00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:33.150
<v Speaker 1>it was about these rich Texans who </v>
<v Speaker 1>lived,</v>

585
00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:35.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a one percent lifestyle.</v>

586
00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:39.090
<v Speaker 1>And it was the most popular show in East</v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany.</v>

587
00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:42.030
<v Speaker 1>The streets would empty so that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>could watch dallas.</v>

588
00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:47.390
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're sitting in your horrible </v>

589
00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:50.991
<v Speaker 1>Soviet architecture flat that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had to struggle to get with your </v>

590
00:36:51.601 --> 00:36:56.601
<v Speaker 1>informing relatives because one out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>three people in East Germany was an </v>

591
00:36:56.601 --> 00:37:00.210
<v Speaker 1>informer government informer and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>watched Dallas,</v>

592
00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:05.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a little cognitive dissonance </v>

593
00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:07.701
<v Speaker 1>occurring and so fell apart and quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>peaceful.</v>

594
00:37:10.241 --> 00:37:10.980
<v Speaker 1>He actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

595
00:37:10.981 --> 00:37:14.520
<v Speaker 1>there was a war and there was a bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>war in eastern Europe,</v>

596
00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:21.260
<v Speaker 1>but it fell apart remarkably peacefully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so here we are and we don't know </v>

597
00:37:21.811 --> 00:37:24.210
<v Speaker 1>what to do with the Pesky Russians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

598
00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:31.340
<v Speaker 1>at least there's no evidence that there </v>
<v Speaker 1>are mortal enemies for fundamental </v>

599
00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:35.871
<v Speaker 1>reasons of axiomatic presupposition and </v>
<v Speaker 1>things are a lot better in the world </v>

600
00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:45.920
<v Speaker 1>despite what everyone tells you than </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were 40 years ago and there's so </v>

601
00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:48.720
<v Speaker 1>much better than they were 50 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That it's absolutely staggering.</v>

602
00:37:48.990 --> 00:37:53.990
<v Speaker 1>We've lifted more people out of poverty </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the last 15 years that have been </v>

603
00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:56.130
<v Speaker 1>lifted out of poverty in the entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>history of the world before then.</v>

604
00:37:56.580 --> 00:38:01.580
<v Speaker 1>People are gathering economic resources </v>
<v Speaker 1>at a rate that even the wildest </v>

605
00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:05.550
<v Speaker 1>optimists really couldn't dream of </v>
<v Speaker 1>speeding up.</v>

606
00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:11.770
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like we're without our </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems,</v>

607
00:38:11.771 --> 00:38:16.771
<v Speaker 1>but so during that period of time I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>obsessed is a good word with a question </v>

608
00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:30.130
<v Speaker 1>and the question was why would human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings</v>

609
00:38:34.490 --> 00:38:39.490
<v Speaker 3>produced two and then produce a massive </v>
<v Speaker 3>arsenal of hydrogen bombs and I don't </v>

610
00:38:42.521 --> 00:38:47.521
<v Speaker 3>know what you know about hydrogen bombs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they have atom bombs for triggers </v>

611
00:38:47.521 --> 00:38:48.730
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where thinking about,</v>

612
00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:49.900
<v Speaker 3>because an atom bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

613
00:38:49.901 --> 00:38:50.770
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

614
00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:57.080
<v Speaker 3>that's something but a hydrogen bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the son that's really something.</v>

615
00:38:58.120 --> 00:38:59.110
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

616
00:38:59.111 --> 00:39:00.850
<v Speaker 3>there's 20 there at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at,</v>

617
00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:03.970
<v Speaker 3>at the peak of the Cold War and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is still true to some degree.</v>

618
00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:09.600
<v Speaker 3>There were literally tens of thousands </v>
<v Speaker 3>of these weapons aimed at the Soviet </v>

619
00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:14.040
<v Speaker 3>Union then at the West.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was enough to pretty much put </v>

620
00:39:14.141 --> 00:39:18.490
<v Speaker 3>an end to everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's a dangerous game man,</v>

621
00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:21.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and not only because of intent,</v>

622
00:39:21.851 --> 00:39:24.400
<v Speaker 3>but also because of the possibility of </v>
<v Speaker 3>accidental.</v>

623
00:39:24.910 --> 00:39:26.410
<v Speaker 3>Just an accident,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

624
00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:32.220
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just a mistake or just someone who's a </v>

625
00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:32.220
<v Speaker 3>little crazier than you might want them </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be.</v>

626
00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:33.820
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you might think,</v>

627
00:39:33.821 --> 00:39:38.821
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one would want to bring about the </v>

628
00:39:38.821 --> 00:39:40.261
<v Speaker 3>destruction of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that just means you don't know very </v>

629
00:39:40.261 --> 00:39:43.741
<v Speaker 3>much about stellan because of all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who lived in the 20th century who</v>

630
00:39:44.591 --> 00:39:49.591
<v Speaker 3>had power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stalin was the most motivated to bring </v>

631
00:39:50.381 --> 00:39:55.381
<v Speaker 3>everything to an end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some evidence that he was </v>

632
00:39:55.381 --> 00:39:59.041
<v Speaker 3>murdered by Khrushchev and his crew and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Khrushchev was the next leader.</v>

633
00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:05.520
<v Speaker 3>And if he wasn't murdered,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was at least not provided with </v>

634
00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:06.460
<v Speaker 3>medical attention when he was dying.</v>

635
00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:09.490
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

636
00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:14.790
<v Speaker 3>there is reasonable evidence that he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>gearing up to invade western Europe and </v>

637
00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:17.500
<v Speaker 3>he didn't really care how much </v>
<v Speaker 3>destruction would go along with that.</v>

638
00:40:17.501 --> 00:40:22.501
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'd already killed tens of millions of </v>

639
00:40:22.501 --> 00:40:22.501
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had a lot of practice.</v>

640
00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:24.880
<v Speaker 3>He was good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It didn't really bother him.</v>

641
00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:30.180
<v Speaker 3>Maybe even enjoyed it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what the hell?</v>

642
00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:35.930
<v Speaker 3>That's what I thought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How can it be that we're doing this?</v>

643
00:40:35.931 --> 00:40:40.931
<v Speaker 3>It's so insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then I started to think about belief </v>

644
00:40:41.581 --> 00:40:42.650
<v Speaker 3>systems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

645
00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:46.230
<v Speaker 3>because you could say that each camp had</v>
<v Speaker 3>its own belief system.</v>

646
00:40:46.231 --> 00:40:51.231
<v Speaker 3>The one in the West was derived.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It had a very lengthy history derived </v>

647
00:40:51.231 --> 00:40:56.090
<v Speaker 3>from the Greeks and the Romans and Jews </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the Christians and and from various </v>

648
00:40:57.391 --> 00:41:00.390
<v Speaker 3>schools of philosophy and from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>enlightenment and all of that,</v>

649
00:41:00.391 --> 00:41:05.391
<v Speaker 3>and then the Soviet Union was basically </v>
<v Speaker 3>predicated on irrational philosophy that</v>

650
00:41:06.290 --> 00:41:11.290
<v Speaker 3>that opposed the axioms that the West </v>
<v Speaker 3>had evolved and each group organized </v>

651
00:41:13.801 --> 00:41:18.801
<v Speaker 3>their societies around that and no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I took political science for quite a </v>

652
00:41:19.551 --> 00:41:20.090
<v Speaker 3>long time</v>

653
00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:25.130
<v Speaker 3>and the political scientists and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>economists,</v>

654
00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:29.330
<v Speaker 3>they basically thought that people </v>
<v Speaker 3>competed over resources,</v>

655
00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:36.400
<v Speaker 3>but that wasn't a very good answer as </v>
<v Speaker 3>far I was concerned because it wasn't </v>

656
00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:37.400
<v Speaker 3>obvious to me why people valued the </v>
<v Speaker 3>resources they valued.</v>

657
00:41:37.410 --> 00:41:42.410
<v Speaker 3>There is the economist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just assume that there's resources that </v>

658
00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:42.410
<v Speaker 3>you value,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

659
00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:44.420
<v Speaker 3>people can value a lot of different </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

660
00:41:44.421 --> 00:41:49.421
<v Speaker 3>It's not exactly fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you tend to value food very </v>

661
00:41:49.421 --> 00:41:50.600
<v Speaker 3>highly if you're hungry obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

662
00:41:50.601 --> 00:41:55.601
<v Speaker 3>there's lots of things that we value and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we want that seem somewhat </v>

663
00:41:55.601 --> 00:41:57.350
<v Speaker 3>arbitrary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhat like a decision.</v>

664
00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:02.150
<v Speaker 3>So I got more interested in why people </v>
<v Speaker 3>valued things and what it meant to value</v>

665
00:42:02.151 --> 00:42:07.151
<v Speaker 3>something and then what it meant to </v>
<v Speaker 3>believe something and then how it could </v>

666
00:42:09.321 --> 00:42:14.321
<v Speaker 3>be that someone could believe something </v>
<v Speaker 3>so deeply that they would risk their own</v>

667
00:42:14.361 --> 00:42:19.361
<v Speaker 3>death to protect it or at least risk the</v>
<v Speaker 3>death of other people and and maybe on a</v>

668
00:42:20.211 --> 00:42:22.250
<v Speaker 3>massive scale like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

669
00:42:22.251 --> 00:42:24.950
<v Speaker 3>people are committed to their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to their system.</v>

670
00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:31.060
<v Speaker 3>Now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a system of belief is not just a system </v>

671
00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:34.421
<v Speaker 3>of belief.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the things that I came to </v>

672
00:42:34.421 --> 00:42:36.371
<v Speaker 3>understand is that it's not appropriate </v>
<v Speaker 3>to make this to psychological people,</v>

673
00:42:36.981 --> 00:42:39.290
<v Speaker 3>defend their belief systems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's not exactly right.</v>

674
00:42:39.291 --> 00:42:41.720
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have a shared belief system.</v>

675
00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:45.470
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sufficiently shared so that here we</v>

676
00:42:45.471 --> 00:42:47.420
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't know each other.</v>

677
00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:49.010
<v Speaker 3>We're a bunch of primates.</v>

678
00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:53.910
<v Speaker 3>We're in this room and it's peaceful and</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one's scared.</v>

679
00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:55.540
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's pretty amazing.</v>

680
00:42:55.541 --> 00:42:58.240
<v Speaker 3>And that means that we're all acting out</v>
<v Speaker 3>our roles.</v>

681
00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:03.780
<v Speaker 3>So we're acting out our roles and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>have an expectation with regards to </v>

682
00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:05.920
<v Speaker 3>those roles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And those two things match.</v>

683
00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:09.490
<v Speaker 3>And that's the important thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we'll talk about that a lot.</v>

684
00:43:10.770 --> 00:43:14.290
<v Speaker 3>It isn't the belief system or the </v>
<v Speaker 3>integrity of the belief system even it's</v>

685
00:43:14.291 --> 00:43:19.291
<v Speaker 3>the match between the belief system and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the actions of the other people within </v>

686
00:43:19.291 --> 00:43:21.850
<v Speaker 3>the belief system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you want to maintain is that match.</v>

687
00:43:22.330 --> 00:43:27.330
<v Speaker 3>You want to act out your beliefs in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world and you want what you want to </v>

688
00:43:27.371 --> 00:43:28.930
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's good thing.</v>

689
00:43:28.931 --> 00:43:31.480
<v Speaker 3>You get what you want and you validate </v>
<v Speaker 3>your belief system.</v>

690
00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:34.060
<v Speaker 3>Great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>perfect security,</v>

691
00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:38.050
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of that is if we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>interacting even right now,</v>

692
00:43:38.620 --> 00:43:41.770
<v Speaker 3>there's a whole set of expectations that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are governing what we're doing.</v>

693
00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:44.620
<v Speaker 3>Like you don't want me to take your your</v>
<v Speaker 3>little tablet there,</v>

694
00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:46.900
<v Speaker 3>smash it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be shocking,</v>

695
00:43:46.990 --> 00:43:48.550
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't know what the hell to do,</v>

696
00:43:48.970 --> 00:43:53.970
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd be somewhere different if I did </v>

697
00:43:53.970 --> 00:43:54.610
<v Speaker 3>that and you wouldn't know where you </v>
<v Speaker 3>were,</v>

698
00:43:55.660 --> 00:44:00.130
<v Speaker 3>and that's another thing to know because</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a fundamental difference.</v>

699
00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:05.430
<v Speaker 3>There is a fundamental difference </v>
<v Speaker 3>between knowing where you are and not </v>

700
00:44:05.471 --> 00:44:10.471
<v Speaker 3>knowing where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's in some sense the </v>

701
00:44:10.471 --> 00:44:14.371
<v Speaker 3>fundamental difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can think about it as the </v>

702
00:44:14.371 --> 00:44:14.371
<v Speaker 3>distinction between explored an </v>
<v Speaker 3>unexplored territory,</v>

703
00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:15.520
<v Speaker 3>but you have to.</v>

704
00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:24.860
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you've ever taken a cat </v>
<v Speaker 3>to a new house.</v>

705
00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:30.040
<v Speaker 3>Cats hate that and because in our old </v>
<v Speaker 3>house and maybe in their old </v>

706
00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:32.340
<v Speaker 3>neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've slunk around</v>

707
00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:35.820
<v Speaker 1>at the edges,</v>
<v Speaker 1>checking everything out.</v>

708
00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:39.570
<v Speaker 1>They start out freight afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They check everything out.</v>

709
00:44:39.630 --> 00:44:41.160
<v Speaker 1>They know where to hide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know where to.</v>

710
00:44:41.250 --> 00:44:42.030
<v Speaker 1>They knew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they knew,</v>

711
00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:47.150
<v Speaker 1>they know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's safe and they know that because </v>

712
00:44:47.150 --> 00:44:49.221
<v Speaker 1>they go somewhere and nothing happens </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so then the assuming that it's safe </v>

713
00:44:49.221 --> 00:44:52.380
<v Speaker 1>and they slowly build up a neighborhood </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're comfortable with.</v>

714
00:44:53.010 --> 00:44:58.010
<v Speaker 1>My Dad used to take the dog for a walk </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the cat got lonesome and so it </v>

715
00:44:58.010 --> 00:45:00.030
<v Speaker 1>started to follow him and first of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>it would just go along the buildings,</v>

716
00:45:00.031 --> 00:45:02.310
<v Speaker 1>the houses on their route,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

717
00:45:02.610 --> 00:45:07.610
<v Speaker 1>hiding really from predators and after a</v>
<v Speaker 1>while it got kind of comfortable with </v>

718
00:45:07.741 --> 00:45:09.900
<v Speaker 1>that and then it would follow right </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind the dog.</v>

719
00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:15.320
<v Speaker 1>But it had a border.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if my dad took the dog over one </v>

720
00:45:16.501 --> 00:45:21.501
<v Speaker 1>street too many for the cat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cat would just sit on the corner </v>

721
00:45:21.501 --> 00:45:21.501
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

722
00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:23.500
<v Speaker 1>cry like a cap cries.</v>

723
00:45:23.550 --> 00:45:25.680
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it for me,</v>

724
00:45:25.681 --> 00:45:30.681
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going any farther out into the </v>

725
00:45:30.681 --> 00:45:33.321
<v Speaker 1>unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the distinction between the </v>

726
00:45:33.321 --> 00:45:38.151
<v Speaker 1>territory that you have mastered and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>territory that you haven't mastered is a</v>

727
00:45:39.241 --> 00:45:44.241
<v Speaker 1>fundamental distinction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the distinction between home and </v>

728
00:45:44.241 --> 00:45:48.470
<v Speaker 1>the strange land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the thing about familiar territory </v>

729
00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:52.880
<v Speaker 1>for people is that most of the familiar </v>
<v Speaker 1>territory that we inhabit is other </v>

730
00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:55.620
<v Speaker 1>people because we're so social.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can't really think.</v>

731
00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:57.630
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird way of thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>territory.</v>

732
00:45:57.631 --> 00:46:01.230
<v Speaker 1>It's not exactly geographical objective </v>
<v Speaker 1>territory.</v>

733
00:46:01.231 --> 00:46:04.890
<v Speaker 1>It's territory with a dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy in it.</v>

734
00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:08.250
<v Speaker 1>And the dominance hierarchy has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>predictable structure and you know where</v>

735
00:46:08.251 --> 00:46:13.251
<v Speaker 1>you fit in it most of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that when you act out in that </v>

736
00:46:13.251 --> 00:46:16.881
<v Speaker 1>territory surrounded by your people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then often you get what you want and </v>

737
00:46:16.881 --> 00:46:21.620
<v Speaker 1>you're so thrilled about that because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you just don't want someone acting </v>

738
00:46:21.620 --> 00:46:22.640
<v Speaker 1>radically around you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

739
00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:27.950
<v Speaker 1>and you know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he walked down blue or and there's </v>

740
00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:29.590
<v Speaker 1>people there that should really be </v>
<v Speaker 1>institutionalized,</v>

741
00:46:29.591 --> 00:46:34.390
<v Speaker 1>but we institutionalize them all so they</v>
<v Speaker 1>could be free and free to be,</v>

742
00:46:34.690 --> 00:46:39.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering and malfunctioning out on the </v>

743
00:46:39.690 --> 00:46:40.710
<v Speaker 1>street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what the freedom ended up being.</v>

744
00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:45.950
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll walk by someone like that who's </v>

745
00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:47.880
<v Speaker 1>monitoring away to the voices in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>head,</v>

746
00:46:47.881 --> 00:46:48.300
<v Speaker 1>didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

747
00:46:48.301 --> 00:46:48.690
<v Speaker 1>maybe</v>

748
00:46:50.990 --> 00:46:55.990
<v Speaker 1>striking out against whatever it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's plaguing him and you will make </v>

749
00:46:56.091 --> 00:46:59.750
<v Speaker 1>eye contact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might even go across the street.</v>

750
00:46:59.751 --> 00:47:01.640
<v Speaker 1>You're certainly going to give him a </v>
<v Speaker 1>wide berth.</v>

751
00:47:01.641 --> 00:47:06.641
<v Speaker 1>You're going to keep a distance between </v>
<v Speaker 1>him and you and you're going to hope </v>

752
00:47:06.651 --> 00:47:11.651
<v Speaker 1>that you don't attract his attention </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's not in the dominance </v>

753
00:47:11.651 --> 00:47:14.000
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy and you don't know what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hell he might do.</v>

754
00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:18.830
<v Speaker 1>And that's unexplored territory too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another way of thinking about it.</v>

755
00:47:18.831 --> 00:47:23.831
<v Speaker 1>Like we inhabit time and space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just space and not just time.</v>

756
00:47:24.711 --> 00:47:28.730
<v Speaker 1>We inhabit time and space and our </v>
<v Speaker 1>territories are spacial.</v>

757
00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:34.620
<v Speaker 1>We're here now and this is safe now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it saved partly because of the </v>

758
00:47:35.231 --> 00:47:40.231
<v Speaker 1>physical structure and it's working,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also safe because none of you </v>

759
00:47:40.231 --> 00:47:44.341
<v Speaker 1>are manifesting peculiar behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you started to manifest peculiar </v>

760
00:47:45.191 --> 00:47:48.910
<v Speaker 1>behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you stood up and started muttering or</v>

761
00:47:48.911 --> 00:47:51.850
<v Speaker 1>yelling or maybe attacking someone next </v>
<v Speaker 1>to you,</v>

762
00:47:52.450 --> 00:47:57.450
<v Speaker 1>all the rest of you would freeze first </v>
<v Speaker 1>because then all of a sudden this would </v>

763
00:47:57.450 --> 00:48:00.790
<v Speaker 1>be unexplored territory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the match between what you want,</v>

764
00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:03.850
<v Speaker 1>which is a peaceful lecture that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>hope has some content,</v>

765
00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:11.320
<v Speaker 1>the match between what you want and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's happening has vanished and so </v>

766
00:48:11.691 --> 00:48:15.590
<v Speaker 1>then you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know where you are and so then</v>

767
00:48:15.591 --> 00:48:17.270
<v Speaker 1>what do you do when you don't know where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are?</v>

768
00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:19.820
<v Speaker 1>What do you do when you don't know what </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do?</v>

769
00:48:20.650 --> 00:48:21.590
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if your computer,</v>

770
00:48:21.591 --> 00:48:26.591
<v Speaker 1>you just crash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know what good is that to you?</v>

771
00:48:26.750 --> 00:48:29.180
<v Speaker 1>You're just going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That isn't helpful.</v>

772
00:48:31.220 --> 00:48:36.220
<v Speaker 1>You freeze first and then maybe you </v>
<v Speaker 1>cautiously cautiously attend or maybe </v>

773
00:48:36.681 --> 00:48:41.681
<v Speaker 1>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you just keep your damn eyes </v>

774
00:48:41.681 --> 00:48:41.681
<v Speaker 1>averted and you sit there and you hope </v>
<v Speaker 1>that no one notices you.</v>

775
00:48:41.681 --> 00:48:43.790
<v Speaker 1>That's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a prey response,</v>

776
00:48:43.791 --> 00:48:48.791
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like a rabbit frozen when it </v>

777
00:48:48.791 --> 00:48:49.280
<v Speaker 1>thinks a fox is looking at it and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>were prey animals for a long time.</v>

778
00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:53.060
<v Speaker 1>There was a cat that they recently </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovered,</v>

779
00:48:53.061 --> 00:48:58.061
<v Speaker 1>a prehistoric cat that had this bottom </v>
<v Speaker 1>single tooth and they found out that a </v>

780
00:48:58.731 --> 00:49:03.110
<v Speaker 1>human skull fit right inside its mouth </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it could grab you here and Pierce</v>

781
00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:06.740
<v Speaker 1>the back of your skull with its,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with its single tooth.</v>

782
00:49:06.741 --> 00:49:10.070
<v Speaker 1>And that's what it was evolved for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

783
00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:17.710
<v Speaker 1>it's under such conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We evolved and we're predators </v>

784
00:49:17.710 --> 00:49:20.861
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but were tasty predators and so other </v>

785
00:49:20.861 --> 00:49:21.020
<v Speaker 1>things were perfectly happy to eat us.</v>

786
00:49:24.270 --> 00:49:26.250
<v Speaker 1>And so when you're aware you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>what to do,</v>

787
00:49:26.251 --> 00:49:31.251
<v Speaker 1>you act like a prey animal and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably what you should do because </v>

788
00:49:31.251 --> 00:49:33.780
<v Speaker 1>maybe if you keep your head down and </v>
<v Speaker 1>shut the hell up,</v>

789
00:49:34.830 --> 00:49:38.580
<v Speaker 1>there will be any attention to attracted</v>
<v Speaker 1>to you and maybe you'll get through it.</v>

790
00:49:39.030 --> 00:49:41.220
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might decide,</v>

791
00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:46.350
<v Speaker 1>unlikely to intervene and take the guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>

792
00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:51.920
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you would be the exception rather </v>

793
00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:53.850
<v Speaker 1>than the norm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's unsurprising.</v>

794
00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:04.040
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what I came to understand was that </v>

795
00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:05.730
<v Speaker 1>belief systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>regulated emotions,</v>

796
00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:10.080
<v Speaker 1>but not exactly psychologically like it </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't exactly.</v>

797
00:50:12.020 --> 00:50:17.020
<v Speaker 1>It isn't exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is sort of like the terror </v>

798
00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:19.341
<v Speaker 1>management theories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not exactly like you have a theory </v>

799
00:50:19.341 --> 00:50:21.591
<v Speaker 1>in your head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the theory explains the world and </v>

800
00:50:21.591 --> 00:50:21.591
<v Speaker 1>because of the theory explains the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

801
00:50:21.591 --> 00:50:24.120
<v Speaker 1>The theory is what's making you secure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like that.</v>

802
00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:28.850
<v Speaker 1>It's like you have a theory in your head</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the makes you feel secure because it</v>

803
00:50:28.851 --> 00:50:33.851
<v Speaker 1>explains the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the reason that explains the world </v>

804
00:50:33.851 --> 00:50:36.340
<v Speaker 1>is because other people have the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>theory in their head and then when you </v>

805
00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:39.491
<v Speaker 1>both act out the theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you both get what you want and it's </v>

806
00:50:39.491 --> 00:50:43.091
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the coming together of the theory </v>

807
00:50:43.091 --> 00:50:43.910
<v Speaker 1>and the outcome that makes you.</v>

808
00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:50.900
<v Speaker 1>It's life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only does it stop you from being </v>

809
00:50:50.900 --> 00:50:53.220
<v Speaker 1>anxious and often make you happy because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get what you want,</v>

810
00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:56.220
<v Speaker 1>but it's not just psychological.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

811
00:50:56.221 --> 00:51:00.120
<v Speaker 1>the fact that we do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we cooperate within our societies.</v>

812
00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:02.520
<v Speaker 1>We match our belief systems and then act</v>
<v Speaker 1>them out.</v>

813
00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:05.670
<v Speaker 1>That's the predicate for a productive </v>
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>

814
00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:09.150
<v Speaker 1>So it's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't just that it saves,</v>

815
00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:11.340
<v Speaker 1>saves you from death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety,</v>

816
00:51:11.341 --> 00:51:14.060
<v Speaker 1>like the terror management theorists </v>
<v Speaker 1>have it.</v>

817
00:51:14.061 --> 00:51:17.580
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it saves you from death and that's good.</v>

818
00:51:17.581 --> 00:51:19.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being protected from death,</v>

819
00:51:19.561 --> 00:51:20.300
<v Speaker 1>anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

820
00:51:20.340 --> 00:51:22.050
<v Speaker 1>Oh good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's great too,</v>

821
00:51:22.051 --> 00:51:24.180
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But actually not dying.</v>

822
00:51:24.181 --> 00:51:26.460
<v Speaker 1>That's sort of the fundamental thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're after.</v>

823
00:51:27.390 --> 00:51:30.630
<v Speaker 1>And so people have reason to defend </v>
<v Speaker 1>their territory.</v>

824
00:51:30.631 --> 00:51:35.631
<v Speaker 1>If you think of territory that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you think about it as a domain where </v>

825
00:51:35.631 --> 00:51:40.191
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental presuppositions of each </v>
<v Speaker 1>citizen are matched by the behavior of </v>

826
00:51:40.261 --> 00:51:43.680
<v Speaker 1>their coast citizens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have every reason to defend that.</v>

827
00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:49.640
<v Speaker 1>And if it falls apart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can have mortally serious </v>

828
00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:51.460
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's chaos,</v>

829
00:51:51.510 --> 00:51:56.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that chaos doesn't just destabilize </v>

830
00:51:56.510 --> 00:51:56.510
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Psychologically.</v>

831
00:51:56.510 --> 00:51:59.210
<v Speaker 1>It destabilizes everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can destabilize the currency.</v>

832
00:51:59.211 --> 00:52:01.600
<v Speaker 1>If can destabilize the industrial </v>
<v Speaker 1>economy,</v>

833
00:52:01.601 --> 00:52:03.400
<v Speaker 1>it can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The lights can go off.</v>

834
00:52:03.401 --> 00:52:08.140
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Hey,</v>

835
00:52:08.141 --> 00:52:09.520
<v Speaker 1>no wonder people protected.</v>

836
00:52:14.770 --> 00:52:19.770
<v Speaker 1>So then I started thinking about what a </v>
<v Speaker 1>belief system was and I realized that a </v>

837
00:52:24.621 --> 00:52:27.380
<v Speaker 1>belief system was actually a set of </v>
<v Speaker 1>moral guidelines</v>

838
00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:33.950
<v Speaker 1>and moral guidelines are guidelines </v>
<v Speaker 1>about how you should behave also how you</v>

839
00:52:33.951 --> 00:52:38.510
<v Speaker 1>should perceive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason that a moral guideline is</v>

840
00:52:38.511 --> 00:52:43.511
<v Speaker 1>necessary for you to perceive is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't look at anything without a </v>

841
00:52:44.031 --> 00:52:46.310
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy of value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

842
00:52:46.670 --> 00:52:49.130
<v Speaker 1>Think about it like how many things in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this room could you look out?</v>

843
00:52:49.610 --> 00:52:53.210
<v Speaker 1>There's an in innumerable things in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>room to look at.</v>

844
00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:57.020
<v Speaker 1>There's just all this squares,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the little tiny squares in this fabric.</v>

845
00:52:57.180 --> 00:52:59.930
<v Speaker 1>You could look at those things for til </v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of time,</v>

846
00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:01.880
<v Speaker 1>one at a time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't do that.</v>

847
00:53:02.780 --> 00:53:04.940
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I took most of you out of this room,</v>

848
00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:07.850
<v Speaker 1>there's a very low probability that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll be.</v>

849
00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:12.880
<v Speaker 1>You'd be able to tell me what color the </v>
<v Speaker 1>walls were or even if those things were </v>

850
00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:17.171
<v Speaker 1>on the walls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that who </v>

851
00:53:17.171 --> 00:53:19.970
<v Speaker 1>cares?</v>
<v Speaker 1>As long as the walls don't move,</v>

852
00:53:20.510 --> 00:53:21.560
<v Speaker 1>colors irrelevant.</v>

853
00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:23.360
<v Speaker 1>And there's no reason for you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember it.</v>

854
00:53:23.540 --> 00:53:27.330
<v Speaker 1>It has no emotional significance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has no value.</v>

855
00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:30.570
<v Speaker 1>And so what you do instead is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

856
00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:34.550
<v Speaker 1>this is what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why are you here to.</v>

857
00:53:34.660 --> 00:53:37.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean in the broad metaphysical </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

858
00:53:37.591 --> 00:53:40.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean specifically why are you here </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now?</v>

859
00:53:40.740 --> 00:53:41.520
<v Speaker 1>And I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

860
00:53:41.521 --> 00:53:46.110
<v Speaker 1>your students obviously and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to get a degree and you know,</v>

861
00:53:46.111 --> 00:53:48.930
<v Speaker 1>you believe that that will have some </v>
<v Speaker 1>functional utility.</v>

862
00:53:49.020 --> 00:53:52.950
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you'll be a little wiser and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little more literate and a little and be</v>

863
00:53:52.951 --> 00:53:57.951
<v Speaker 1>able to think a little better and be </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to write a little better and so </v>

864
00:53:57.951 --> 00:53:57.951
<v Speaker 1>you'll actually be more functional in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

865
00:53:58.320 --> 00:54:00.120
<v Speaker 1>That would be good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

866
00:54:00.121 --> 00:54:01.830
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe you're interested in,</v>

867
00:54:02.010 --> 00:54:02.790
<v Speaker 1>but anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

868
00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:08.720
<v Speaker 1>you're in this particular lecture so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can take this particular class </v>

869
00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:14.120
<v Speaker 1>so that you can get a particular kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>degree so that you could launch your </v>

870
00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:17.991
<v Speaker 1>life and then in your life you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably going to meet someone that you </v>

871
00:54:17.991 --> 00:54:19.770
<v Speaker 1>have a longterm relationship with and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have children and you're</v>

872
00:54:19.771 --> 00:54:21.300
<v Speaker 1>going to partake in this society.</v>

873
00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:24.540
<v Speaker 1>And that's why you're here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of those reasons,</v>

874
00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:29.880
<v Speaker 1>similar caneously is why you're here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then that helps you decide what </v>

875
00:54:30.241 --> 00:54:35.241
<v Speaker 1>to look at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what you look at is at the </v>

876
00:54:35.241 --> 00:54:36.210
<v Speaker 1>moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or listen to is me,</v>

877
00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:41.240
<v Speaker 1>because in principle I'm the gateway to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that set of accomplishments at this </v>

878
00:54:43.921 --> 00:54:48.921
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you focus on me and that's </v>

879
00:54:49.201 --> 00:54:53.160
<v Speaker 1>because you value that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is you can't even</v>

880
00:54:53.161 --> 00:54:55.110
<v Speaker 1>look at the world without a value </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>

881
00:54:56.410 --> 00:55:01.410
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's chaos if everything is equally </v>

882
00:55:01.410 --> 00:55:01.410
<v Speaker 1>unimportant or if everything is equally </v>
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

883
00:55:02.010 --> 00:55:07.010
<v Speaker 1>It's chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so value system structures the very </v>

884
00:55:07.010 --> 00:55:09.990
<v Speaker 1>way that you perceive the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't mean that metaphysically.</v>

885
00:55:09.991 --> 00:55:12.270
<v Speaker 1>There's plenty of experiments that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>demonstrated that,</v>

886
00:55:12.271 --> 00:55:14.670
<v Speaker 1>like the invisible gorilla experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

887
00:55:14.790 --> 00:55:17.280
<v Speaker 1>how many of you know about the end of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the invisible gorilla experiment?</v>

888
00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:18.120
<v Speaker 1>How many don't?</v>

889
00:55:20.940 --> 00:55:24.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

890
00:55:24.511 --> 00:55:27.120
<v Speaker 1>what happens is that there are two </v>
<v Speaker 1>teams,</v>

891
00:55:27.330 --> 00:55:32.330
<v Speaker 1>a white team dressed dressed in white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the team dressed in black and </v>

892
00:55:32.330 --> 00:55:34.140
<v Speaker 1>there's video of them and the black team</v>
<v Speaker 1>is passing the basketball back and forth</v>

893
00:55:34.141 --> 00:55:39.141
<v Speaker 1>and the white team is passing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>basketball back and forth and you're </v>

894
00:55:39.141 --> 00:55:42.231
<v Speaker 1>supposed to count the Times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The basketball gets passed back and </v>

895
00:55:42.231 --> 00:55:42.231
<v Speaker 1>forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's only one basketball.</v>

896
00:55:42.690 --> 00:55:43.380
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

897
00:55:43.460 --> 00:55:48.460
<v Speaker 1>you're diligent for whatever reason you </v>
<v Speaker 1>do what the experiment or asks you and </v>

898
00:55:50.131 --> 00:55:52.290
<v Speaker 1>you count the basketball tosses and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

899
00:55:52.590 --> 00:55:54.540
<v Speaker 1>well that's not so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like 16.</v>

900
00:55:55.290 --> 00:55:59.100
<v Speaker 1>So you tell them 16 and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you see the gorilla?</v>

901
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:03.270
<v Speaker 1>And half of you say what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you talking about?</v>

902
00:56:04.110 --> 00:56:06.210
<v Speaker 1>And the experimenter says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well let's watch again,</v>

903
00:56:06.211 --> 00:56:11.211
<v Speaker 1>but this time don't count.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll sure enough like 30 seconds into </v>

904
00:56:11.211 --> 00:56:14.100
<v Speaker 1>the video and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the players fill the video screen.</v>

905
00:56:14.101 --> 00:56:16.320
<v Speaker 1>It's not like they're 300 yards in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>distance,</v>

906
00:56:16.321 --> 00:56:21.321
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like little ants playing basketball </v>

907
00:56:21.321 --> 00:56:21.321
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

908
00:56:21.321 --> 00:56:21.660
<v Speaker 1>Filling the screen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see their faces.</v>

909
00:56:22.900 --> 00:56:27.900
<v Speaker 1>Sure enough a minute into the video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy in a gorilla suit and he's not </v>

910
00:56:28.061 --> 00:56:30.460
<v Speaker 1>little and neither is the gorilla suit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He comes out,</v>

911
00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:35.880
<v Speaker 1>bangs his chest right in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the screen for five seconds and then </v>

912
00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:38.740
<v Speaker 1>disappears and half more than half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

913
00:56:38.741 --> 00:56:41.200
<v Speaker 1>if people don't see that and it's even </v>
<v Speaker 1>worse down.</v>

914
00:56:41.201 --> 00:56:42.880
<v Speaker 1>Simon did another experiment where</v>

915
00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:46.070
<v Speaker 1>you're at a counter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

916
00:56:46.071 --> 00:56:50.420
<v Speaker 1>at a store and there's a clerk there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking to the clerk.</v>

917
00:56:50.421 --> 00:56:55.320
<v Speaker 1>And the clerk goes down hypothetically </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get something in,</v>

918
00:56:55.321 --> 00:56:57.780
<v Speaker 1>a different clerk pops up and you'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

919
00:56:57.840 --> 00:56:59.190
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I noticed that,</v>

920
00:56:59.820 --> 00:57:04.820
<v Speaker 1>but you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can even vary the clerk quite a </v>

921
00:57:04.820 --> 00:57:08.991
<v Speaker 1>bit and people don't notice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we focus on very particular things.</v>

922
00:57:11.491 --> 00:57:16.491
<v Speaker 1>And the reason we don't notice this </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it actually doesn't matter in </v>

923
00:57:16.491 --> 00:57:17.340
<v Speaker 1>terms of the ongoing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our ongoing action.</v>

924
00:57:17.341 --> 00:57:22.341
<v Speaker 1>At that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the clerk is interchangeable as long as </v>

925
00:57:22.341 --> 00:57:25.470
<v Speaker 1>the entity there acts like a clerk </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's sufficient.</v>

926
00:57:38.610 --> 00:57:43.050
<v Speaker 1>So leave system structure your </v>
<v Speaker 1>perceptions,</v>

927
00:57:43.051 --> 00:57:45.390
<v Speaker 1>value systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to call them value systems.</v>

928
00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:50.750
<v Speaker 1>They structure your perceptions and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>also guide your actions because you act </v>

929
00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:55.410
<v Speaker 1>in accordance with your values,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious or unconscious.</v>

930
00:57:55.710 --> 00:58:00.710
<v Speaker 1>You have values that you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>about because you just don't know </v>

931
00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:00.710
<v Speaker 1>yourself very well.</v>

932
00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:00.710
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

933
00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:02.910
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can tell that,</v>

934
00:58:03.380 --> 00:58:08.380
<v Speaker 1>that you have values that you don't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>very well because sometimes you get </v>

935
00:58:08.380 --> 00:58:11.280
<v Speaker 1>attracted to people that you know you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't perfectly well that's a mistake.</v>

936
00:58:11.880 --> 00:58:16.880
<v Speaker 1>Or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to tell yourself to study </v>

937
00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:16.880
<v Speaker 1>and you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

938
00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:19.080
<v Speaker 1>so there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not really in control of yourself</v>

939
00:58:19.081 --> 00:58:22.290
<v Speaker 1>to any great degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some and the more integrated you are,</v>

940
00:58:22.291 --> 00:58:27.291
<v Speaker 1>the more control you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know you're kind of a loose </v>

941
00:58:27.291 --> 00:58:29.691
<v Speaker 1>collection of arguing subpersonalities </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're more or less directed </v>

942
00:58:29.821 --> 00:58:34.821
<v Speaker 1>towards a single goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it depends on how committed you are </v>

943
00:58:34.821 --> 00:58:34.980
<v Speaker 1>to that goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much you've thought it through,</v>

944
00:58:35.190 --> 00:58:40.190
<v Speaker 1>how much you buy into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many of the contradictions in your </v>

945
00:58:40.190 --> 00:58:43.020
<v Speaker 1>world representation you've managed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>iron out and all of that,</v>

946
00:58:44.070 --> 00:58:46.920
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in any case,</v>

947
00:58:46.921 --> 00:58:51.921
<v Speaker 1>it's value systems that government </v>
<v Speaker 1>action and perception and so we're going</v>

948
00:58:53.001 --> 00:58:54.320
<v Speaker 1>to take an existential</v>

949
00:58:56.210 --> 00:59:01.210
<v Speaker 1>perspective of phenomenal logical and an</v>
<v Speaker 1>existential perspective in this course </v>

950
00:59:01.210 --> 00:59:02.870
<v Speaker 1>and phenomenological means that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to.</v>

951
00:59:03.380 --> 00:59:08.380
<v Speaker 1>We're going to base our presuppositions </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the idea that what you experience is </v>

952
00:59:08.481 --> 00:59:09.920
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of it.</v>

953
00:59:10.850 --> 00:59:15.850
<v Speaker 1>We're not really dividing the world into</v>
<v Speaker 1>object and subject that that isn't how </v>

954
00:59:15.850 --> 00:59:19.391
<v Speaker 1>this particular approach works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more like you have a field of </v>

955
00:59:19.391 --> 00:59:20.600
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It includes things like pain,</v>

956
00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:25.730
<v Speaker 1>which is not really something objective </v>
<v Speaker 1>and but it's real.</v>

957
00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:30.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I've come to </v>

958
00:59:30.760 --> 00:59:32.201
<v Speaker 1>understand is you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are not required to believe what I'm</v>

959
00:59:32.331 --> 00:59:33.440
<v Speaker 1>telling you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

960
00:59:34.190 --> 00:59:39.190
<v Speaker 1>if you have an argument about why some </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this doesn't make sense,</v>

961
00:59:41.930 --> 00:59:45.830
<v Speaker 1>then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>follow that sucker because I'm trying to</v>

962
00:59:45.890 --> 00:59:50.090
<v Speaker 1>tell you what I've reached with regards </v>
<v Speaker 1>to bedrock presuppositions and I haven't</v>

963
00:59:50.091 --> 00:59:52.940
<v Speaker 1>been able to put pry bars underneath </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

964
00:59:53.180 --> 00:59:55.750
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean you won't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

965
00:59:56.990 --> 00:59:57.800
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

966
00:59:57.801 --> 01:00:02.801
<v Speaker 1>you should try anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moral System tells you how to act and </v>

967
01:00:07.691 --> 01:00:12.691
<v Speaker 1>what to see and a shared moral system </v>
<v Speaker 1>keeps your emotions under control and </v>

968
01:00:14.141 --> 01:00:15.880
<v Speaker 1>fulfills your motivation leads.</v>

969
01:00:20.550 --> 01:00:25.550
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this old idea of David humes and</v>

970
01:00:25.861 --> 01:00:30.861
<v Speaker 1>David Hume famously posited that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>cannot derive in ought from an is.</v>

971
01:00:36.030 --> 01:00:41.030
<v Speaker 1>And what he meant by that was that </v>
<v Speaker 1>merely knowing the objective facts about</v>

972
01:00:41.461 --> 01:00:46.461
<v Speaker 1>something does not tell you how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>implement those facts in your life and </v>

973
01:00:47.581 --> 01:00:50.730
<v Speaker 1>that that's actually a gap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you could say,</v>

974
01:00:50.790 --> 01:00:52.080
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is the case,</v>

975
01:00:52.081 --> 01:00:57.081
<v Speaker 1>that that's actually a necessary </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of the scientific endeavor </v>

976
01:00:57.081 --> 01:01:01.311
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to do as a scientist is to strip </v>

977
01:01:01.311 --> 01:01:02.760
<v Speaker 1>away the value of the object,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

978
01:01:02.761 --> 01:01:07.740
<v Speaker 1>Because I don't care what your </v>
<v Speaker 1>idiosyncratic notion of the object is,</v>

979
01:01:08.010 --> 01:01:13.010
<v Speaker 1>I want to know how you perceive the </v>
<v Speaker 1>object such that everyone else will </v>

980
01:01:13.010 --> 01:01:17.901
<v Speaker 1>perceive it at least that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that takes the subjectivity </v>

981
01:01:17.901 --> 01:01:21.501
<v Speaker 1>completely out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it might just be a necessary </v>

982
01:01:21.501 --> 01:01:24.030
<v Speaker 1>consequence of the scientific method </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it doesn't have a morality implicit</v>

983
01:01:24.031 --> 01:01:27.090
<v Speaker 1>in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People argue about that.</v>

984
01:01:27.091 --> 01:01:28.650
<v Speaker 1>Sam Harris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

985
01:01:28.651 --> 01:01:32.160
<v Speaker 1>argues he believes that we can come up </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a scientific morality.</v>

986
01:01:32.430 --> 01:01:33.550
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

987
01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:38.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that because I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that you could make rational </v>

988
01:01:39.390 --> 01:01:41.580
<v Speaker 1>judgments about value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's too complicated.</v>

989
01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:45.300
<v Speaker 1>It's far too complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something that has to emerge.</v>

990
01:01:45.301 --> 01:01:45.870
<v Speaker 1>It can't be.</v>

991
01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:53.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marxism was supposed to be a scientific </v>

992
01:01:53.580 --> 01:01:53.930
<v Speaker 1>utopia predicated on scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>principles and all of that.</v>

993
01:01:53.931 --> 01:01:58.931
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just didn't work anyways.</v>

994
01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:06.040
<v Speaker 1>So I kind of buy hume's argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't derive an art from it is now.</v>

995
01:02:08.380 --> 01:02:10.720
<v Speaker 1>That's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

996
01:02:10.721 --> 01:02:13.060
<v Speaker 1>it's a problem because you have factual </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge,</v>

997
01:02:13.061 --> 01:02:14.650
<v Speaker 1>but you don't know how to implement it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

998
01:02:14.651 --> 01:02:17.350
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should you spend money on aids or should</v>

999
01:02:17.351 --> 01:02:20.730
<v Speaker 1>you spend money on cancer or should </v>
<v Speaker 1>spend money on higher education,</v>

1000
01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:26.240
<v Speaker 1>how the hell are you going to calculate </v>
<v Speaker 1>that rationally you can't because you </v>

1001
01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:29.310
<v Speaker 1>just don't have the information at hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not possible to,</v>

1002
01:02:29.870 --> 01:02:34.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I worked for UN committee at one point </v>

1003
01:02:34.870 --> 01:02:37.101
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the UN committee had like 100 proposals </v>

1004
01:02:37.101 --> 01:02:38.850
<v Speaker 1>for how the world could be improved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was no order to them.</v>

1005
01:02:38.910 --> 01:02:41.670
<v Speaker 1>It's like it wasn't that this was more </v>
<v Speaker 1>important than this.</v>

1006
01:02:41.671 --> 01:02:42.360
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

1007
01:02:45.090 --> 01:02:46.670
<v Speaker 1>that's the end of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1008
01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:51.680
<v Speaker 1>you to start with something and so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>means you have to make something more </v>

1009
01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:52.230
<v Speaker 1>important than other things have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously in your life.</v>

1010
01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:56.160
<v Speaker 1>If everything is of equal importance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're paralyzed.</v>

1011
01:03:04.140 --> 01:03:09.140
<v Speaker 1>Now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a truism and probably an </v>

1012
01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:13.401
<v Speaker 1>oversimplified one that since the dawn </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the scientific revolution,</v>

1013
01:03:15.470 --> 01:03:20.470
<v Speaker 1>a wedge has been driven through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>heart of our society such that the moral</v>

1014
01:03:21.661 --> 01:03:26.661
<v Speaker 1>systems that we use to unite us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those would be religious systems </v>

1015
01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:28.980
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally</v>

1016
01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:34.430
<v Speaker 1>have been subject to an intense critique</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the scientists.</v>

1017
01:03:34.431 --> 01:03:39.431
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty effective critique even if </v>

1018
01:03:39.431 --> 01:03:43.511
<v Speaker 1>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you've maintained a traditional </v>

1019
01:03:43.511 --> 01:03:43.511
<v Speaker 1>faith,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like</v>

1020
01:03:43.511 --> 01:03:43.520
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1021
01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:48.890
<v Speaker 1>the scientific onslaught is no joke and</v>

1022
01:03:50.770 --> 01:03:55.020
<v Speaker 1>that's a problem as far as I can tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>because and the problem is,</v>

1023
01:03:55.021 --> 01:03:58.450
<v Speaker 1>is that you're still left with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem of how you should act.</v>

1024
01:03:58.750 --> 01:04:01.190
<v Speaker 1>And Nietzsche,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the philosopher Nietzsche,</v>

1025
01:04:01.191 --> 01:04:06.191
<v Speaker 1>where he would say that we're running on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fumes of Christianity in the West </v>

1026
01:04:06.940 --> 01:04:10.840
<v Speaker 1>because over it's thousand years of </v>
<v Speaker 1>domination to let's say,</v>

1027
01:04:10.841 --> 01:04:15.841
<v Speaker 1>1500 years of absolute domination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it produced a consensus of morality that</v>

1028
01:04:17.381 --> 01:04:22.381
<v Speaker 1>was predicated on metaphysical </v>
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions and that organized </v>

1029
01:04:22.381 --> 01:04:25.831
<v Speaker 1>societies and those societies are </v>
<v Speaker 1>predicated on certain beliefs like the </v>

1030
01:04:26.351 --> 01:04:31.351
<v Speaker 1>belief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And really I would say that something </v>

1031
01:04:31.351 --> 01:04:31.580
<v Speaker 1>divined inhabits each individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1032
01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:33.880
<v Speaker 1>that's sort of presumption that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>embedded in law.</v>

1033
01:04:33.881 --> 01:04:36.430
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of the idea that underlies the</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of natural.</v>

1034
01:04:36.431 --> 01:04:37.000
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1035
01:04:37.150 --> 01:04:42.070
<v Speaker 1>There's something about you that's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>valuable that even the law has to bow to</v>

1036
01:04:42.071 --> 01:04:44.380
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you're reprehensible,</v>

1037
01:04:44.410 --> 01:04:47.830
<v Speaker 1>even if you're convicted in </v>
<v Speaker 1>reprehensible now.</v>

1038
01:04:47.831 --> 01:04:52.831
<v Speaker 1>That's man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that people came up with that </v>

1039
01:04:52.831 --> 01:04:52.831
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a bloody miracle.</v>

1040
01:04:52.831 --> 01:04:53.140
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1041
01:04:53.141 --> 01:04:58.141
<v Speaker 1>because generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your proclivity is if someone's been </v>

1042
01:04:58.141 --> 01:05:02.641
<v Speaker 1>even accused of doing something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that general human proclivity is that </v>

1043
01:05:02.641 --> 01:05:04.390
<v Speaker 1>even if someone's just been accused of </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing something terrible,</v>

1044
01:05:04.391 --> 01:05:09.391
<v Speaker 1>that's enough so that you can stone them</v>
<v Speaker 1>to death or do whatever you're going to </v>

1045
01:05:09.391 --> 01:05:10.420
<v Speaker 1>do with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Presumption of innocence before guilt,</v>

1046
01:05:10.690 --> 01:05:15.690
<v Speaker 1>good God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of all the things that aren't automatic </v>

1047
01:05:15.690 --> 01:05:16.300
<v Speaker 1>that's got a top the list,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1048
01:05:16.301 --> 01:05:21.301
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievable that that occurs and </v>

1049
01:05:21.301 --> 01:05:22.960
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting to me because it seems </v>
<v Speaker 1>to me that</v>

1050
01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:29.880
<v Speaker 1>that presupposition that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something valuable transcendent about </v>

1051
01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:33.331
<v Speaker 1>each individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't call that a scientific </v>

1052
01:05:33.331 --> 01:05:37.411
<v Speaker 1>presupposition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seems to be a highly functional </v>

1053
01:05:37.411 --> 01:05:37.411
<v Speaker 1>presupposition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1054
01:05:37.411 --> 01:05:42.300
<v Speaker 1>I think in that it isn't unreasonable to</v>
<v Speaker 1>notice that societies that have</v>

1055
01:05:44.590 --> 01:05:49.590
<v Speaker 1>value the individual and made the law </v>
<v Speaker 1>subject to the individual even with </v>

1056
01:05:50.831 --> 01:05:53.890
<v Speaker 1>regards to voting because that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically what voting does,</v>

1057
01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:55.750
<v Speaker 1>put sovereignty in the hands of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1058
01:05:56.260 --> 01:06:01.260
<v Speaker 1>Those societies actually seemed to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now whether they'll work for the next </v>

1059
01:06:01.391 --> 01:06:03.760
<v Speaker 1>300 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who the hell knows?</v>

1060
01:06:03.761 --> 01:06:08.761
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they've worked pretty well for the </v>

1061
01:06:08.761 --> 01:06:08.761
<v Speaker 1>last 500 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

1062
01:06:08.761 --> 01:06:12.360
<v Speaker 1>and we've got it pretty good right now </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1063
01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:17.520
<v Speaker 1>I suspect most of you are rather pleased</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the law recognizes your value as </v>

1064
01:06:17.861 --> 01:06:20.530
<v Speaker 1>individuals and you take that for </v>
<v Speaker 1>granted,</v>

1065
01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:25.560
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think you have rights and of course </v>

1066
01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:28.441
<v Speaker 1>the rights that you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>natural rights are a logical consequence</v>

1067
01:06:29.501 --> 01:06:34.501
<v Speaker 1>of your transcendent value and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>nested in this as niches observation </v>

1068
01:06:35.470 --> 01:06:40.470
<v Speaker 1>that's nested in a set of metaphysical </v>
<v Speaker 1>beliefs and his idea was that if you </v>

1069
01:06:40.470 --> 01:06:40.470
<v Speaker 1>wipe out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

1070
01:06:40.690 --> 01:06:45.690
<v Speaker 1>you wipe out the metaphysical beliefs </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually wipe out the whole system </v>

1071
01:06:45.690 --> 01:06:49.620
<v Speaker 1>because you've knocked out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cornerstone and it might take a long </v>

1072
01:06:49.620 --> 01:06:51.490
<v Speaker 1>time for the thing to shake and fall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1073
01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:56.290
<v Speaker 1>but it will now whether he was right or </v>
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>

1074
01:06:56.770 --> 01:07:01.770
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks to me like what's happened </v>

1075
01:07:01.770 --> 01:07:05.950
<v Speaker 1>since Nietzsche announced the death of </v>
<v Speaker 1>God in say the late 18 hundreds,</v>

1076
01:07:05.951 --> 01:07:09.970
<v Speaker 1>is that western society is oscillated </v>
<v Speaker 1>between extremes.</v>

1077
01:07:10.690 --> 01:07:15.690
<v Speaker 1>Extremes on the right Germany extremes </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the left and you know,</v>

1078
01:07:16.541 --> 01:07:18.850
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the democracies,</v>

1079
01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:24.140
<v Speaker 1>at least the other democracies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>democracies managing to stay the course </v>

1080
01:07:25.091 --> 01:07:27.370
<v Speaker 1>somewhere down the middle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1081
01:07:30.990 --> 01:07:35.990
<v Speaker 1>but it's not obvious to me that that can</v>
<v Speaker 1>be maintained without the underlying </v>

1082
01:07:36.091 --> 01:07:41.091
<v Speaker 1>metaphysics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a problem because whatever </v>

1083
01:07:41.250 --> 01:07:43.770
<v Speaker 1>you might say about the underlying </v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphysics,</v>

1084
01:07:45.710 --> 01:07:50.710
<v Speaker 1>it's not true the way science is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that could be okay because there </v>

1085
01:07:50.710 --> 01:07:52.160
<v Speaker 1>might be more than one form of truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

1086
01:07:52.310 --> 01:07:53.890
<v Speaker 1>I think there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1087
01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:59.060
<v Speaker 1>I think there's pragmatic truth and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think pragmatic truth is actually deeper</v>

1088
01:07:59.061 --> 01:08:04.061
<v Speaker 1>than scientific truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And pragmatic truth is the truth that </v>

1089
01:08:04.061 --> 01:08:08.531
<v Speaker 1>enable you to act in a manner that best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It improves the probability roughly </v>

1090
01:08:11.211 --> 01:08:14.900
<v Speaker 1>speaking of your existence and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>reproduction maximally.</v>

1091
01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:19.220
<v Speaker 1>That's a Darwinian idea on one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things about the Darwinian theory,</v>

1092
01:08:20.700 --> 01:08:23.540
<v Speaker 1>this kind of puts it in opposition to </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific materialism,</v>

1093
01:08:23.541 --> 01:08:28.541
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the Darwinian theory is that you</v>

1094
01:08:28.641 --> 01:08:33.641
<v Speaker 1>don't have privileged knowledge of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world and you can actually tell that </v>

1095
01:08:33.641 --> 01:08:34.770
<v Speaker 1>because you die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1096
01:08:34.790 --> 01:08:37.700
<v Speaker 1>If you knew enough about the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't die and you do die,</v>

1097
01:08:37.701 --> 01:08:42.701
<v Speaker 1>and so you're an embodied theory of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts and that theory is good enough to </v>

1098
01:08:42.701 --> 01:08:46.691
<v Speaker 1>get you along about 80 years and </v>
<v Speaker 1>produced some reasonable probability </v>

1099
01:08:47.391 --> 01:08:49.970
<v Speaker 1>that you'll have children and that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>all survive.</v>

1100
01:08:49.971 --> 01:08:50.660
<v Speaker 1>That's it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1101
01:08:50.661 --> 01:08:55.661
<v Speaker 1>That's what you've managed after 3 </v>
<v Speaker 1>billion years of evolution.</v>

1102
01:08:58.670 --> 01:09:03.670
<v Speaker 1>It's a good enough solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good enough way of acting and we </v>

1103
01:09:03.670 --> 01:09:06.671
<v Speaker 1>don't know a better way of acting and </v>
<v Speaker 1>our world conceptions are actually </v>

1104
01:09:06.671 --> 01:09:11.080
<v Speaker 1>nested inside the Darwinian system and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they might be predicated on pragmatic </v>

1105
01:09:13.311 --> 01:09:18.311
<v Speaker 1>truths rather than objective truths.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pragmatic truths are truths that have </v>

1106
01:09:18.311 --> 01:09:22.811
<v Speaker 1>functional utility and we're alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We care about being alive.</v>

1107
01:09:23.930 --> 01:09:28.930
<v Speaker 1>We tend to use our theories as tools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's possible that our theories are </v>

1108
01:09:28.930 --> 01:09:31.100
<v Speaker 1>tools and that they're tools to help us </v>
<v Speaker 1>stay alive.</v>

1109
01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:39.650
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was reading a bit about Camille Paglia</v>

1110
01:09:40.130 --> 01:09:42.200
<v Speaker 1>the other day and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1111
01:09:43.010 --> 01:09:48.010
<v Speaker 1>I've noticed some similarities between.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's a famous gadfly.</v>

1112
01:09:49.630 --> 01:09:52.930
<v Speaker 1>I would say a feminists have classic </v>
<v Speaker 1>modern feminists,</v>

1113
01:09:52.931 --> 01:09:54.820
<v Speaker 1>although she would regard yourself as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>feminist,</v>

1114
01:09:55.540 --> 01:10:00.540
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you want to watch someone who's </v>

1115
01:10:00.540 --> 01:10:03.930
<v Speaker 1>verbally who has verbal mastery beyond </v>
<v Speaker 1>belief,</v>

1116
01:10:04.750 --> 01:10:07.030
<v Speaker 1>it's you could watch Camille Paglia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's,</v>

1117
01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:09.070
<v Speaker 1>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she seems a little manic to me.</v>

1118
01:10:09.370 --> 01:10:14.370
<v Speaker 1>She can wrap off and argument at a rate </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just mind boggling and it's very </v>

1119
01:10:14.370 --> 01:10:19.141
<v Speaker 1>coherent and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she tends to shred her opponents and </v>

1120
01:10:19.141 --> 01:10:19.141
<v Speaker 1>arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's so brilliant.</v>

1121
01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:20.270
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1122
01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:26.880
<v Speaker 1>she said something interesting and she's</v>
<v Speaker 1>been influenced by some of the same </v>

1123
01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:30.390
<v Speaker 1>people that I've been influenced by it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She liked this book by Eric Norman </v>

1124
01:10:30.390 --> 01:10:31.840
<v Speaker 1>called the origins and history of </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness,</v>

1125
01:10:31.841 --> 01:10:35.470
<v Speaker 1>which I would recommend if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in union theory,</v>

1126
01:10:35.590 --> 01:10:38.290
<v Speaker 1>Carl Young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good introduction to union theory</v>

1127
01:10:38.470 --> 01:10:43.470
<v Speaker 1>and it's about the development of </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness and it's predicated like </v>

1128
01:10:45.821 --> 01:10:50.560
<v Speaker 1>young's work and Joseph Campbell's work </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Mircera Elliot is work,</v>

1129
01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:55.680
<v Speaker 1>all of which has been criticized or </v>
<v Speaker 1>ignored by the postmodernist predicated </v>

1130
01:10:56.591 --> 01:11:00.190
<v Speaker 1>on id on the idea that human beings have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a central narrative</v>

1131
01:11:01.350 --> 01:11:01.740
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>

1132
01:11:04.730 --> 01:11:09.730
<v Speaker 1>that central narrative is the dramatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>expression of</v>

1133
01:11:12.630 --> 01:11:17.630
<v Speaker 3>the human system of values and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's built into us.</v>

1134
01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:19.120
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1135
01:11:19.121 --> 01:11:22.140
<v Speaker 3>it's part of our nature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have a nature as human beings.</v>

1136
01:11:22.950 --> 01:11:26.190
<v Speaker 3>We're not infinitely malleable white </v>
<v Speaker 3>culture,</v>

1137
01:11:28.050 --> 01:11:31.830
<v Speaker 3>which is a postmodernist claim and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>dangerous one.</v>

1138
01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:39.520
<v Speaker 3>It's dangerous if we have a nature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Paglia has this idea</v>

1139
01:11:40.660 --> 01:11:41.080
<v Speaker 2>that</v>

1140
01:11:43.260 --> 01:11:48.260
<v Speaker 3>the reason that you come to university </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you studied the humanities or the </v>

1141
01:11:48.260 --> 01:11:52.191
<v Speaker 3>proper reason if you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is not to engage in premature and </v>

1142
01:11:53.941 --> 01:11:58.320
<v Speaker 3>destructive criticism of something that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't even get understand,</v>

1143
01:11:59.370 --> 01:12:04.370
<v Speaker 3>but to learn as much as you can about </v>
<v Speaker 3>art and literature and poetry and drama</v>

1144
01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:10.960
<v Speaker 2>and fiction</v>

1145
01:12:12.170 --> 01:12:15.170
<v Speaker 3>and religious thinking and this is all a</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of a.</v>

1146
01:12:15.410 --> 01:12:17.900
<v Speaker 3>You think about it as a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is that?</v>

1147
01:12:18.620 --> 01:12:20.470
<v Speaker 3>What is all that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's art,</v>

1148
01:12:21.170 --> 01:12:22.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>culture.</v>

1149
01:12:23.060 --> 01:12:26.360
<v Speaker 3>Music belongs in that category and like </v>
<v Speaker 3>what the hell?</v>

1150
01:12:26.361 --> 01:12:27.620
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what about music?</v>

1151
01:12:27.650 --> 01:12:29.870
<v Speaker 3>It's like everyone loves it or almost </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone.</v>

1152
01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:35.920
<v Speaker 3>It's a mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You listened to music and it's very </v>

1153
01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:35.920
<v Speaker 3>meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1154
01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:37.220
<v Speaker 3>music gets people through some pretty </v>
<v Speaker 3>dark times.</v>

1155
01:12:37.310 --> 01:12:41.090
<v Speaker 3>Why it's not obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's for sure.</v>

1156
01:12:41.270 --> 01:12:42.410
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in most cultures,</v>

1157
01:12:42.411 --> 01:12:45.320
<v Speaker 3>music plays a very central role in </v>
<v Speaker 3>identity formation.</v>

1158
01:12:45.321 --> 01:12:50.321
<v Speaker 3>And you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you'll probably find as you age </v>

1159
01:12:50.321 --> 01:12:53.111
<v Speaker 3>that your favorite music will be the </v>
<v Speaker 3>music that you listened to between the </v>

1160
01:12:53.111 --> 01:12:56.420
<v Speaker 3>ages of 16 and 20.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of like an imprints on you and</v>

1161
01:12:56.421 --> 01:13:00.490
<v Speaker 3>it defines a maybe that defines a </v>
<v Speaker 3>generation and maybe you know,</v>

1162
01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:02.840
<v Speaker 3>in our tribal past,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is highly likely</v>

1163
01:13:05.130 --> 01:13:10.130
<v Speaker 3>when you were being inculcated into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>tribal culture that was inculcated with </v>

1164
01:13:11.761 --> 01:13:15.390
<v Speaker 3>dance and with masks and with music all </v>
<v Speaker 3>at the same time.</v>

1165
01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:20.600
<v Speaker 3>So you're invited to participate in this</v>
<v Speaker 3>drama and to take your place in this </v>

1166
01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:23.850
<v Speaker 3>drama and to think of that as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>representation of the objective world is</v>

1167
01:13:23.851 --> 01:13:25.650
<v Speaker 3>just not right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That isn't what it is.</v>

1168
01:13:26.070 --> 01:13:31.070
<v Speaker 3>It's an invitation to a drama.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now then the question might be,</v>

1169
01:13:31.770 --> 01:13:36.770
<v Speaker 3>well is the drama reel?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the answer to that is it depends on </v>

1170
01:13:37.081 --> 01:13:42.081
<v Speaker 3>what you mean by real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that great dramas are more real </v>

1171
01:13:42.081 --> 01:13:45.000
<v Speaker 3>than real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're hyperreal there.</v>

1172
01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:54.800
<v Speaker 3>They're hyper real because they provide </v>
<v Speaker 3>guidelines about how to act that are </v>

1173
01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:58.400
<v Speaker 3>abstract and even perhaps generic but </v>
<v Speaker 3>applicable across an extraordinary broad</v>

1174
01:13:58.981 --> 01:14:01.920
<v Speaker 3>range of situations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So imagine this,</v>

1175
01:14:02.550 --> 01:14:03.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get up in the morning,</v>

1176
01:14:04.530 --> 01:14:08.070
<v Speaker 3>you do a bunch of things and someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>asks you what you're doing,</v>

1177
01:14:08.250 --> 01:14:11.320
<v Speaker 3>what you did and you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1178
01:14:11.340 --> 01:14:12.010
<v Speaker 3>you tell them while</v>

1179
01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:17.010
<v Speaker 1>the first thing I did this morning was </v>
<v Speaker 1>open my eyes and the second thing was </v>

1180
01:14:17.010 --> 01:14:18.700
<v Speaker 1>think about whether I want it to go back</v>
<v Speaker 1>to sleep and then,</v>

1181
01:14:19.030 --> 01:14:21.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took off my blankets and then I put my</v>

1182
01:14:21.490 --> 01:14:25.480
<v Speaker 1>feet on the floor and then I stood up </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was blinking while I was doing all</v>

1183
01:14:25.481 --> 01:14:27.670
<v Speaker 1>this and I was also breathing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

1184
01:14:28.090 --> 01:14:29.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I looked for my call and you,</v>

1185
01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:32.650
<v Speaker 1>you really want to listen to that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to listen to that guy.</v>

1186
01:14:32.830 --> 01:14:33.710
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you,</v>

1187
01:14:33.940 --> 01:14:38.940
<v Speaker 1>why are you telling me that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want you to tell me something </v>

1188
01:14:38.940 --> 01:14:39.130
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1189
01:14:39.190 --> 01:14:42.070
<v Speaker 1>what is it that's interesting and why </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't that interesting?</v>

1190
01:14:42.790 --> 01:14:44.960
<v Speaker 1>It's not obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1191
01:14:45.210 --> 01:14:50.210
<v Speaker 1>so then imagine the guy actually tells </v>
<v Speaker 1>you a pretty good story and a little </v>

1192
01:14:50.210 --> 01:14:52.840
<v Speaker 1>adventure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably he was doing something normal.</v>

1193
01:14:52.841 --> 01:14:54.400
<v Speaker 1>Something unexpected happened.</v>

1194
01:14:54.730 --> 01:14:59.730
<v Speaker 1>He had to conjure up some new responses </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he settled the problem or didn't </v>

1195
01:14:59.730 --> 01:14:59.770
<v Speaker 1>settle the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1196
01:14:59.771 --> 01:15:03.910
<v Speaker 1>you're interested in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially if he settled the problem,</v>

1197
01:15:03.911 --> 01:15:08.890
<v Speaker 1>because if he can tell you how when he </v>
<v Speaker 1>encountered some unexplored territory,</v>

1198
01:15:09.490 --> 01:15:14.490
<v Speaker 1>he was able to sew it back together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then maybe you can do that when that </v>

1199
01:15:14.490 --> 01:15:16.300
<v Speaker 1>thing happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's pretty cheap wisdom for you.</v>

1200
01:15:16.301 --> 01:15:18.070
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had to go through all the aggravation</v>

1201
01:15:18.071 --> 01:15:19.390
<v Speaker 1>of figuring it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1202
01:15:19.391 --> 01:15:21.520
<v Speaker 1>you have to do is listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1203
01:15:21.550 --> 01:15:24.430
<v Speaker 1>and that's kind of a classic story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Classic Story.</v>

1204
01:15:24.670 --> 01:15:28.780
<v Speaker 1>Roughly speaking is there's a guy or </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman,</v>

1205
01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:33.900
<v Speaker 1>doesn't matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go on about their life relatively </v>

1206
01:15:33.900 --> 01:15:36.040
<v Speaker 1>normally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something blindsides them and they're in</v>

1207
01:15:36.041 --> 01:15:40.990
<v Speaker 1>a state of chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chaos is the place.</v>

1208
01:15:41.710 --> 01:15:46.710
<v Speaker 1>Chaos is the place that you end up when </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing and the world stopped </v>

1209
01:15:48.941 --> 01:15:52.450
<v Speaker 1>matching and the chaos can be of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different degrees.</v>

1210
01:15:52.450 --> 01:15:57.450
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could wake up and find that your </v>

1211
01:15:57.450 --> 01:15:57.490
<v Speaker 1>house was burgled and you could wake up </v>
<v Speaker 1>and find that apparent.</v>

1212
01:15:57.550 --> 01:16:02.550
<v Speaker 1>Has Your parent has Alzheimer's or some </v>
<v Speaker 1>fatal disease or that you do or that </v>

1213
01:16:02.550 --> 01:16:05.020
<v Speaker 1>your whole family was murdered or that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a war starting her?</v>

1214
01:16:05.070 --> 01:16:10.070
<v Speaker 1>You know there's different degrees of </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos and I think you can quantify the </v>

1215
01:16:12.941 --> 01:16:17.941
<v Speaker 1>chaos by calculating how much of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you do and expect is likely to be </v>

1216
01:16:20.201 --> 01:16:25.201
<v Speaker 1>disrupted by the event now because that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the more disruption in the more </v>

1217
01:16:26.411 --> 01:16:31.411
<v Speaker 1>destabilized you're going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why if if someone tells you </v>

1218
01:16:31.411 --> 01:16:33.430
<v Speaker 1>that you're going to perish painfully in</v>
<v Speaker 1>three months,</v>

1219
01:16:33.431 --> 01:16:38.431
<v Speaker 1>it's like that's a bad one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're really in an unexpected territory</v>

1220
01:16:41.061 --> 01:16:46.061
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing that you assumed that was real </v>

1221
01:16:46.061 --> 01:16:47.300
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking in the world is real </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

1222
01:16:49.690 --> 01:16:54.690
<v Speaker 1>We like to watch people in their normal </v>
<v Speaker 1>life blindsided by something </v>

1223
01:16:56.820 --> 01:17:01.820
<v Speaker 1>experiencing this inter regnum of chaos </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they explore and gather new </v>

1224
01:17:02.701 --> 01:17:07.701
<v Speaker 1>information and retooled their character</v>
<v Speaker 1>or retool the world because you either </v>

1225
01:17:07.831 --> 01:17:12.831
<v Speaker 1>of those would work as a and then come </v>
<v Speaker 1>out the other side and things are better</v>

1226
01:17:13.341 --> 01:17:15.950
<v Speaker 1>than they were to begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least as good,</v>

1227
01:17:15.951 --> 01:17:18.170
<v Speaker 1>but better is better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a happy ending,</v>

1228
01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:19.730
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a happy ending.</v>

1229
01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:21.560
<v Speaker 1>That's a comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Technically speaking,</v>

1230
01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:22.640
<v Speaker 1>and so</v>

1231
01:17:24.510 --> 01:17:26.550
<v Speaker 1>what you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want your life to be a comedy,</v>

1232
01:17:27.300 --> 01:17:32.300
<v Speaker 1>not that it's supposed to be funny </v>
<v Speaker 1>because comedy doesn't have to be funny </v>

1233
01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:34.440
<v Speaker 1>technically speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just the opposite of tragedy.</v>

1234
01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:39.560
<v Speaker 1>Tragedy is when you're going along </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty well and you get blindsided and </v>

1235
01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:41.340
<v Speaker 1>that's that and you know that can </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly happen.</v>

1236
01:17:41.341 --> 01:17:46.341
<v Speaker 1>It happens to people all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a comedy want now.</v>

1237
01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:57.200
<v Speaker 1>What I hope to provide you with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there a magic code?</v>

1238
01:17:58.950 --> 01:18:02.370
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a book published a while back.</v>

1239
01:18:05.070 --> 01:18:10.070
<v Speaker 1>Tom Hanks was in the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a harvard professor who went </v>

1240
01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:12.320
<v Speaker 1>around solving symbolic mysteries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember what,</v>

1241
01:18:12.321 --> 01:18:14.370
<v Speaker 1>what was it called?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The DAVINCI code.</v>

1242
01:18:14.490 --> 01:18:19.020
<v Speaker 1>Everyone liked that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sold a lot and you know,</v>

1243
01:18:19.021 --> 01:18:22.560
<v Speaker 1>it was a little mysteries and it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>full of hints that there was more to the</v>

1244
01:18:22.561 --> 01:18:27.561
<v Speaker 1>world than you think and which is </v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely true and that,</v>

1245
01:18:28.140 --> 01:18:33.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a way of getting access to </v>

1246
01:18:33.140 --> 01:18:33.140
<v Speaker 1>that knowledge and then it would really </v>
<v Speaker 1>be worthwhile.</v>

1247
01:18:33.140 --> 01:18:34.890
<v Speaker 1>And people liked that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They liked that idea.</v>

1248
01:18:34.980 --> 01:18:37.080
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually.</v>

1249
01:18:37.350 --> 01:18:40.500
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's true,</v>

1250
01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:43.230
<v Speaker 1>it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1251
01:18:44.250 --> 01:18:45.570
<v Speaker 1>like fiction is true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so okay,</v>

1252
01:18:45.571 --> 01:18:47.820
<v Speaker 1>let's go back to the guy who's telling </v>
<v Speaker 1>you about his morning.</v>

1253
01:18:48.870 --> 01:18:50.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he tells you something exciting.</v>

1254
01:18:52.230 --> 01:18:57.230
<v Speaker 1>Well then imagine that 10 people tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>you something exciting and then you </v>

1255
01:18:57.230 --> 01:19:01.281
<v Speaker 1>extract out the pattern of them dealing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with this problem from that and so then </v>

1256
01:19:02.851 --> 01:19:03.420
<v Speaker 1>you have a.</v>

1257
01:19:03.750 --> 01:19:06.330
<v Speaker 1>that's what you do if you're an author,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1258
01:19:06.331 --> 01:19:07.890
<v Speaker 1>Because in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a book,</v>

1259
01:19:08.310 --> 01:19:13.310
<v Speaker 1>you don't want the book exactly to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>about what ordinary people do in </v>

1260
01:19:13.310 --> 01:19:17.601
<v Speaker 1>ordinary times in their life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you already know how to be </v>

1261
01:19:17.601 --> 01:19:18.120
<v Speaker 1>ordinary during ordinary times of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

1262
01:19:18.121 --> 01:19:19.530
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not useful.</v>

1263
01:19:20.340 --> 01:19:25.340
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't watch a video tape of </v>

1264
01:19:25.340 --> 01:19:27.201
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine you videotaped yourself during </v>

1265
01:19:27.201 --> 01:19:28.290
<v Speaker 1>the day and then the next day you </v>
<v Speaker 1>watched that.</v>

1266
01:19:28.670 --> 01:19:31.170
<v Speaker 1>It's like God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who would want to do that?</v>

1267
01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:35.250
<v Speaker 1>So what seems to happen in stories is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they distill,</v>

1268
01:19:35.550 --> 01:19:38.550
<v Speaker 1>they distill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they watch people,</v>

1269
01:19:38.551 --> 01:19:41.970
<v Speaker 1>people watch people and then they tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories about what they see,</v>

1270
01:19:41.971 --> 01:19:43.860
<v Speaker 1>but they leave a lot out of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories.</v>

1271
01:19:44.010 --> 01:19:49.010
<v Speaker 1>Everything that's boring hopefully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then more and more stories about </v>

1272
01:19:49.591 --> 01:19:54.591
<v Speaker 1>exciting things get sort of aggregated </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then maybe a great writer comes </v>

1273
01:19:54.591 --> 01:19:55.920
<v Speaker 1>along and write something really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really interesting,</v>

1274
01:19:56.670 --> 01:19:59.790
<v Speaker 1>profound character transformations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you say,</v>

1275
01:19:59.791 --> 01:20:00.630
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fiction.</v>

1276
01:20:00.990 --> 01:20:05.990
<v Speaker 1>And then you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's not true because it's </v>

1277
01:20:05.990 --> 01:20:07.020
<v Speaker 1>fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then then maybe that's not right.</v>

1278
01:20:09.180 --> 01:20:13.080
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's more than true because who </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants the truth?</v>

1279
01:20:13.110 --> 01:20:16.170
<v Speaker 1>The truth is mundane reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you've already got that mastered.</v>

1280
01:20:16.470 --> 01:20:21.470
<v Speaker 1>What you want is the distillation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting experience.</v>

1281
01:20:22.290 --> 01:20:23.040
<v Speaker 1>And you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1282
01:20:23.041 --> 01:20:24.600
<v Speaker 1>why is it interesting?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1283
01:20:24.601 --> 01:20:26.910
<v Speaker 1>that's a really good question because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't actually know.</v>

1284
01:20:27.390 --> 01:20:32.390
<v Speaker 1>And believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really don't know because you'll be </v>

1285
01:20:32.390 --> 01:20:32.390
<v Speaker 1>interested in things that just don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>make any sense at all.</v>

1286
01:20:32.390 --> 01:20:36.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to walk you a bit today </v>
<v Speaker 1>through Pinocchio and we'll do that more</v>

1287
01:20:36.300 --> 01:20:38.400
<v Speaker 1>the next time to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1288
01:20:38.430 --> 01:20:40.950
<v Speaker 1>But I want to tell you a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that movie to begin with,</v>

1289
01:20:40.980 --> 01:20:45.240
<v Speaker 1>just so you know how crazy you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know the plot.</v>

1290
01:20:45.270 --> 01:20:46.740
<v Speaker 1>How many people have seen the Disney </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie?</v>

1291
01:20:46.741 --> 01:20:48.660
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1292
01:20:48.661 --> 01:20:53.661
<v Speaker 1>So lots of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's strange enough in itself that </v>

1293
01:20:53.661 --> 01:20:55.500
<v Speaker 1>so many people have seen it and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>worth thinking about,</v>

1294
01:20:55.501 --> 01:21:00.501
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you tend to show your kids that moody </v>

1295
01:21:00.501 --> 01:21:00.501
<v Speaker 1>and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But do you think about the movie?</v>

1296
01:21:00.501 --> 01:21:05.091
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing some pretty weird things </v>

1297
01:21:05.091 --> 01:21:05.091
<v Speaker 1>when you're sitting there watching that </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie,</v>

1298
01:21:05.091 --> 01:21:05.820
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1299
01:21:06.330 --> 01:21:08.010
<v Speaker 1>it's drawings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1300
01:21:08.011 --> 01:21:10.980
<v Speaker 1>And they're low resolution drawings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't care.</v>

1301
01:21:11.250 --> 01:21:13.590
<v Speaker 1>And you watch the simpsons or maybe fa </v>
<v Speaker 1>or a.</v>

1302
01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:14.430
<v Speaker 1>what's that called?</v>

1303
01:21:16.490 --> 01:21:21.490
<v Speaker 1>The the one that's been concentrating on</v>
<v Speaker 1>political correctness so much south </v>

1304
01:21:21.490 --> 01:21:21.490
<v Speaker 1>park.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

1305
01:21:21.490 --> 01:21:23.220
<v Speaker 1>that animation man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just awful,</v>

1306
01:21:23.670 --> 01:21:24.960
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just horrible.</v>

1307
01:21:24.961 --> 01:21:29.961
<v Speaker 1>It couldn't be worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't care like round heads smile a </v>

1308
01:21:31.380 --> 01:21:36.380
<v Speaker 1>little bit of shuffling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a person as far as your concern </v>

1309
01:21:36.380 --> 01:21:37.620
<v Speaker 1>is just irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if it was higher resolution,</v>

1310
01:21:37.770 --> 01:21:40.560
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just need the bare bones,</v>

1311
01:21:40.561 --> 01:21:42.960
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dang your perceptions on.</v>

1312
01:21:43.860 --> 01:21:48.860
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you watched this drawing that's been </v>

1313
01:21:48.860 --> 01:21:51.420
<v Speaker 1>oakeel beautiful drawings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>animated in a sequence.</v>

1314
01:21:51.930 --> 01:21:56.930
<v Speaker 1>You don't watching something real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're watching a pure construction and </v>

1315
01:21:56.930 --> 01:22:00.120
<v Speaker 1>then you think about the plot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's completely absurd.</v>

1316
01:22:00.180 --> 01:22:02.040
<v Speaker 1>Everything about it is absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1317
01:22:02.430 --> 01:22:07.430
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the characters is a bug and he </v>

1318
01:22:07.430 --> 01:22:10.110
<v Speaker 1>turns out to be the conscience and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell is up with that?</v>

1319
01:22:10.740 --> 01:22:15.740
<v Speaker 1>And then there's another character is </v>
<v Speaker 1>this puppet Marionette and you know,</v>

1320
01:22:16.380 --> 01:22:21.380
<v Speaker 1>somehow he gets free of his strings and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then goes on this adventure and then </v>

1321
01:22:21.380 --> 01:22:22.690
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you know,</v>

1322
01:22:22.700 --> 01:22:27.700
<v Speaker 1>he gets enticed into various nefarious </v>
<v Speaker 1>places by a Fox and a cat and then he </v>

1323
01:22:30.091 --> 01:22:35.091
<v Speaker 1>rescues his father from a whale and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't even know how his father God in </v>

1324
01:22:35.091 --> 01:22:35.091
<v Speaker 1>the way.</v>

1325
01:22:35.091 --> 01:22:40.070
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the last time you see his </v>

1326
01:22:40.070 --> 01:22:40.070
<v Speaker 1>father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was in a rainstorm and the next thing</v>

1327
01:22:40.070 --> 01:22:41.730
<v Speaker 1>that happens is he's in a whale and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're sitting there thinking,</v>

1328
01:22:41.731 --> 01:22:42.720
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no problem.</v>

1329
01:22:42.721 --> 01:22:44.280
<v Speaker 1>This all makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1330
01:22:44.281 --> 01:22:45.300
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1331
01:22:46.110 --> 01:22:48.750
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does that make sense?</v>

1332
01:22:49.530 --> 01:22:51.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer is you don't know.</v>

1333
01:22:52.290 --> 01:22:54.810
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing that's so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know.</v>

1334
01:22:54.811 --> 01:22:56.190
<v Speaker 1>You don't even know what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching,</v>

1335
01:22:56.880 --> 01:23:01.880
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Watch it and you're interested in </v>

1336
01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:01.880
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to see what the hell happens to</v>

1337
01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:04.410
<v Speaker 1>this puppet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to see if he ends up becoming a</v>

1338
01:23:04.411 --> 01:23:05.800
<v Speaker 1>real boy because</v>

1339
01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:10.980
<v Speaker 3>this seems important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1340
01:23:11.460 --> 01:23:11.960
<v Speaker 3>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1341
01:23:11.961 --> 01:23:13.340
<v Speaker 3>let's Pinocchio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>True.</v>

1342
01:23:17.470 --> 01:23:18.700
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a stupid question.</v>

1343
01:23:22.620 --> 01:23:27.620
<v Speaker 3>It's partly a stupid question because </v>
<v Speaker 3>the answer is it depends what you mean </v>

1344
01:23:27.620 --> 01:23:27.620
<v Speaker 3>by true</v>

1345
01:23:28.670 --> 01:23:29.000
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

1346
01:23:31.190 --> 01:23:35.210
<v Speaker 3>it isn't obvious to me what you should </v>
<v Speaker 3>mean</v>

1347
01:23:36.460 --> 01:23:37.210
<v Speaker 2>when you</v>

1348
01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:43.280
<v Speaker 3>say that something's true and the reason</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not obvious is because we have this</v>

1349
01:23:45.241 --> 01:23:50.241
<v Speaker 3>idea in our society and it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a very profound idea and that idea </v>

1350
01:23:50.241 --> 01:23:54.351
<v Speaker 3>is that the ultimate truth is scientific</v>
<v Speaker 3>truth at that tells us about the nature </v>

1351
01:23:55.111 --> 01:23:58.980
<v Speaker 3>of the world and it does that in a final</v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

1352
01:23:58.981 --> 01:24:03.981
<v Speaker 3>In some sense there is no brooking any </v>
<v Speaker 3>arguments about it and the physicists </v>

1353
01:24:03.981 --> 01:24:08.211
<v Speaker 3>have got it right and that's why they </v>
<v Speaker 3>can make hydrogen bombs and that's a </v>

1354
01:24:08.211 --> 01:24:08.550
<v Speaker 3>pretty good demonstration of their being</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1355
01:24:13.370 --> 01:24:16.160
<v Speaker 3>but you don't act as if that's true</v>

1356
01:24:17.780 --> 01:24:18.560
<v Speaker 2>and you don't.</v>

1357
01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:26.040
<v Speaker 3>And you watch things and pay attention </v>
<v Speaker 3>to things in are captivated by things </v>

1358
01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:27.580
<v Speaker 3>that aren't predicated on those </v>
<v Speaker 3>assumptions.</v>

1359
01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:33.730
<v Speaker 3>And it seems to me that</v>

1360
01:24:36.380 --> 01:24:38.420
<v Speaker 3>there is a problem of what the world is </v>
<v Speaker 3>made out of,</v>

1361
01:24:38.421 --> 01:24:43.421
<v Speaker 3>but there is a bigger problem and that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem of how you should conduct </v>

1362
01:24:43.421 --> 01:24:45.860
<v Speaker 3>yourself in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's really what you want to know.</v>

1363
01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:50.000
<v Speaker 3>People want to know that more than </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything because you need to know.</v>

1364
01:24:50.030 --> 01:24:51.860
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here you guys are in university.</v>

1365
01:24:51.861 --> 01:24:53.210
<v Speaker 3>It's like you don't know what you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>

1366
01:24:53.330 --> 01:24:55.040
<v Speaker 3>I mean some of you know more than </v>
<v Speaker 3>others,</v>

1367
01:24:55.310 --> 01:24:59.630
<v Speaker 3>but you're at the beginning of your life</v>
<v Speaker 3>and life is very complex and chaotic and</v>

1368
01:24:59.990 --> 01:25:01.700
<v Speaker 3>it isn't exactly obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1369
01:25:01.730 --> 01:25:06.730
<v Speaker 3>how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what kind of relationship you should </v>

1370
01:25:06.730 --> 01:25:08.441
<v Speaker 3>form or what sort of character you </v>
<v Speaker 3>should develop or what you're going to </v>

1371
01:25:08.441 --> 01:25:09.950
<v Speaker 3>do for a job or how.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the meaning of life?</v>

1372
01:25:09.951 --> 01:25:12.020
<v Speaker 3>That's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the meaning of life?</v>

1373
01:25:13.250 --> 01:25:15.590
<v Speaker 3>Well then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people come to university,</v>

1374
01:25:15.620 --> 01:25:18.980
<v Speaker 3>at least many of them and that's kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they want to find out now.</v>

1375
01:25:18.981 --> 01:25:23.981
<v Speaker 3>Paglia her notion is that you can think </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it this way,</v>

1376
01:25:24.291 --> 01:25:29.291
<v Speaker 3>is that articulated knowledge is </v>
<v Speaker 3>embedded in inarticulate knowledge and </v>

1377
01:25:32.900 --> 01:25:34.550
<v Speaker 3>inarticulate knowledges.</v>

1378
01:25:36.630 --> 01:25:41.550
<v Speaker 3>The domain of literature and art and and</v>
<v Speaker 3>high culture,</v>

1379
01:25:41.551 --> 01:25:46.380
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's we sort of know what it means,</v>

1380
01:25:47.190 --> 01:25:50.340
<v Speaker 3>but we don't exactly know what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It means more than we know,</v>

1381
01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:56.600
<v Speaker 3>and then outside of that is what we </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know at all and that's an idea </v>

1382
01:25:56.600 --> 01:25:58.680
<v Speaker 3>that you developed as well and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>Paglia picked it up from you because you</v>

1383
01:25:58.681 --> 01:26:03.681
<v Speaker 3>believed that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was this domain that had mastered </v>

1384
01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:08.270
<v Speaker 3>in every domain and then there were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a domain outside of that which</v>

1385
01:26:08.330 --> 01:26:13.330
<v Speaker 3>you could think of as unexplored </v>
<v Speaker 3>territory and what we meant unexplored </v>

1386
01:26:13.330 --> 01:26:16.220
<v Speaker 3>territory with was our creative </v>
<v Speaker 3>imagination and that what we were trying</v>

1387
01:26:16.221 --> 01:26:21.221
<v Speaker 3>to do with our creative imagination is </v>
<v Speaker 3>to figure out how to deal with that </v>

1388
01:26:21.221 --> 01:26:25.961
<v Speaker 3>unexplored territory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were producing dramas that we could </v>

1389
01:26:25.961 --> 01:26:29.390
<v Speaker 3>act out that would help us deal with </v>
<v Speaker 3>what we still hadn't mastered.</v>

1390
01:26:29.780 --> 01:26:32.840
<v Speaker 3>And then outside of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's just what we don't know at all.</v>

1391
01:26:34.100 --> 01:26:36.830
<v Speaker 3>And Paglia his idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this was [inaudible] idea,</v>

1392
01:26:37.580 --> 01:26:42.580
<v Speaker 3>was that without understanding that </v>
<v Speaker 3>surround,</v>

1393
01:26:50.780 --> 01:26:55.780
<v Speaker 3>you're too atomized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not part of your historical </v>

1394
01:26:55.780 --> 01:27:00.281
<v Speaker 3>tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You haven't incorporated the spirit of </v>

1395
01:27:00.281 --> 01:27:02.950
<v Speaker 3>your ancestors who built all this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

1396
01:27:03.250 --> 01:27:08.250
<v Speaker 3>you're just here now and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you don't know what to do either and</v>

1397
01:27:08.301 --> 01:27:13.301
<v Speaker 3>you don't know how to maintain your </v>
<v Speaker 3>culture and you don't know how to serve </v>

1398
01:27:13.301 --> 01:27:13.320
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1399
01:27:13.340 --> 01:27:15.480
<v Speaker 3>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well why should you serve your culture?</v>

1400
01:27:15.481 --> 01:27:18.620
<v Speaker 3>And while I have a hypothesis about </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1401
01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:21.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can think about this,</v>

1402
01:27:21.740 --> 01:27:26.740
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people ask what the meaning of life </v>

1403
01:27:26.740 --> 01:27:30.281
<v Speaker 3>is and it seems to me that meaning is </v>
<v Speaker 3>proportionate to the adoption of </v>

1404
01:27:32.321 --> 01:27:34.650
<v Speaker 3>responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1405
01:27:34.660 --> 01:27:39.350
<v Speaker 3>like let's say you have a little sister </v>
<v Speaker 3>who's like three,</v>

1406
01:27:42.370 --> 01:27:47.370
<v Speaker 3>you're going to take care of her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like questioning whether that's a good </v>

1407
01:27:47.370 --> 01:27:49.670
<v Speaker 3>idea just seemed stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1408
01:27:49.671 --> 01:27:51.530
<v Speaker 3>It just doesn't seem like the right kind</v>
<v Speaker 3>of question.</v>

1409
01:27:51.531 --> 01:27:56.531
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well obviously self-evidently let's say </v>

1410
01:27:56.810 --> 01:28:00.200
<v Speaker 3>that's what you do and you find it </v>
<v Speaker 3>meaningful.</v>

1411
01:28:00.201 --> 01:28:02.390
<v Speaker 3>It's like probably,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1412
01:28:02.540 --> 01:28:05.840
<v Speaker 3>interacting with a little kid when we </v>
<v Speaker 3>had,</v>

1413
01:28:05.890 --> 01:28:07.070
<v Speaker 3>when I had little kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1414
01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:12.120
<v Speaker 3>when they were like two or under,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we took them out to see their relatives </v>

1415
01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:15.600
<v Speaker 3>and they were older people and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they watched that two year old like,</v>

1416
01:28:16.010 --> 01:28:18.230
<v Speaker 3>like it was a fire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1417
01:28:18.231 --> 01:28:22.040
<v Speaker 3>every second that that little kid was in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the room,</v>

1418
01:28:22.310 --> 01:28:26.930
<v Speaker 3>every single adult was focused on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>focused on,</v>

1419
01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:28.820
<v Speaker 3>on him or her.</v>

1420
01:28:31.020 --> 01:28:31.190
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

1421
01:28:31.420 --> 01:28:36.420
<v Speaker 3>That's something that people attend to </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's the source of meaning and </v>

1422
01:28:36.420 --> 01:28:39.160
<v Speaker 3>what else is a meaningful well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your family relationships are meaningful</v>

1423
01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:43.920
<v Speaker 3>to you and maybe the responsibility that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you adopt as,</v>

1424
01:28:43.990 --> 01:28:44.950
<v Speaker 3>as a friend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1425
01:28:44.951 --> 01:28:49.951
<v Speaker 3>that seems meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe your decision to pursue a </v>

1426
01:28:49.951 --> 01:28:51.850
<v Speaker 3>particular career and be of some utility</v>
<v Speaker 3>in society.</v>

1427
01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:57.240
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of that's governed by your desire </v>

1428
01:28:57.240 --> 01:28:57.370
<v Speaker 3>to establish some security and get </v>
<v Speaker 3>ahead.</v>

1429
01:28:57.371 --> 01:29:00.340
<v Speaker 3>It's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're also</v>

1430
01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:07.220
<v Speaker 1>playing an integral role in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>maintenance of the structure that </v>

1431
01:29:07.220 --> 01:29:11.031
<v Speaker 1>supports you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my observation has been that in my </v>

1432
01:29:11.031 --> 01:29:15.081
<v Speaker 1>clinical practice is that people just </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a hell of a time if they don't </v>

1433
01:29:15.081 --> 01:29:16.200
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they don't slot in somewhere,</v>

1434
01:29:16.230 --> 01:29:17.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1435
01:29:17.220 --> 01:29:19.530
<v Speaker 1>you think I got to go to work at nine in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the morning and you know,</v>

1436
01:29:19.531 --> 01:29:21.210
<v Speaker 1>I've got this rigid schedule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1437
01:29:23.270 --> 01:29:28.270
<v Speaker 1>it's probably a good idea to be grateful</v>
<v Speaker 1>for that because what I've noticed is </v>

1438
01:29:28.270 --> 01:29:31.490
<v Speaker 1>that if people pull out from those </v>
<v Speaker 1>externally scaffolded systems,</v>

1439
01:29:32.810 --> 01:29:35.270
<v Speaker 1>they drift,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get depressed,</v>

1440
01:29:35.271 --> 01:29:40.271
<v Speaker 1>they get anxious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't know what to do with </v>

1441
01:29:40.271 --> 01:29:40.271
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1442
01:29:40.271 --> 01:29:40.460
<v Speaker 1>they're kinda like sled dogs with no </v>
<v Speaker 1>sled.</v>

1443
01:29:40.970 --> 01:29:43.250
<v Speaker 1>And we're kinda like sled dogs as far as</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell.</v>

1444
01:29:43.251 --> 01:29:45.710
<v Speaker 1>Beasts of burden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we need a load man.</v>

1445
01:29:46.100 --> 01:29:51.100
<v Speaker 1>We need a load.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the question is what,</v>

1446
01:29:51.320 --> 01:29:54.890
<v Speaker 1>what sort of load do you need?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here's why I think we need,</v>

1447
01:29:55.460 --> 01:29:58.730
<v Speaker 1>we need that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1448
01:29:58.731 --> 01:30:03.731
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been thinking about how to figure </v>

1449
01:30:03.731 --> 01:30:05.180
<v Speaker 1>out what's real for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because I'm an existentialist,</v>

1450
01:30:05.540 --> 01:30:09.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm operating under the presupposition </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can tell what people believe by</v>

1451
01:30:09.561 --> 01:30:11.630
<v Speaker 1>watching what they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how they act.</v>

1452
01:30:11.900 --> 01:30:16.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't care what they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care what their statements are </v>

1453
01:30:16.900 --> 01:30:21.281
<v Speaker 1>about their view of reality because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>correlation,</v>

1454
01:30:21.410 --> 01:30:26.410
<v Speaker 1>the relationship between that and their </v>
<v Speaker 1>actual actions is not certainly not </v>

1455
01:30:27.051 --> 01:30:29.330
<v Speaker 1>perfect and sometimes it doesn't even </v>
<v Speaker 1>exist.</v>

1456
01:30:31.430 --> 01:30:36.020
<v Speaker 1>One thing I've noticed is that people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one argues with their own pain.</v>

1457
01:30:39.190 --> 01:30:44.190
<v Speaker 1>Everyone who hurts acts as if they </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that pain is real.</v>

1458
01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:52.100
<v Speaker 1>So we could say the ultimate reality is </v>
<v Speaker 1>pain.</v>

1459
01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:58.600
<v Speaker 1>That's how people act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in keeping with the claims of many </v>

1460
01:30:58.600 --> 01:31:03.161
<v Speaker 1>religious traditions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know the Jews are always </v>

1461
01:31:03.161 --> 01:31:07.600
<v Speaker 1>recollecting past pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the Christian God is crucified </v>

1462
01:31:07.761 --> 01:31:12.761
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a fair bit of pain there </v>

1463
01:31:12.761 --> 01:31:15.281
<v Speaker 1>for the Buddhists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fundamental maximum is that life is </v>

1464
01:31:15.281 --> 01:31:15.281
<v Speaker 1>suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm.</v>

1465
01:31:15.281 --> 01:31:16.610
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphysical claim.</v>

1466
01:31:16.611 --> 01:31:21.611
<v Speaker 1>There are no metaphysical claim is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>pain is real.</v>

1467
01:31:24.610 --> 01:31:26.380
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course it depends on what you mean by</v>

1468
01:31:26.381 --> 01:31:31.270
<v Speaker 1>real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people act as if their pain is real,</v>

1469
01:31:31.330 --> 01:31:36.330
<v Speaker 1>so that's a good place to start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that poses a problem.</v>

1470
01:31:45.020 --> 01:31:48.350
<v Speaker 1>Life is a pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Life is suffering,</v>

1471
01:31:48.470 --> 01:31:50.240
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and why is that?</v>

1472
01:31:51.620 --> 01:31:54.470
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because you can be broken,</v>

1473
01:31:55.490 --> 01:32:00.100
<v Speaker 1>hurt and destroyed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that</v>

1474
01:32:00.100 --> 01:32:05.100
<v Speaker 3>seems pretty self evident and worse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know it and that makes people </v>

1475
01:32:05.410 --> 01:32:07.810
<v Speaker 3>unique.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's our self consciousness,</v>

1476
01:32:07.811 --> 01:32:12.811
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's really what separates us in some </v>

1477
01:32:12.811 --> 01:32:15.121
<v Speaker 3>sense from other creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean other creatures have some self </v>

1478
01:32:15.121 --> 01:32:19.201
<v Speaker 3>consciousness like a chimp can learn to </v>
<v Speaker 3>recognize itself and a mirror and soak </v>

1479
01:32:19.201 --> 01:32:20.410
<v Speaker 3>in a dolphin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1480
01:32:20.411 --> 01:32:22.600
<v Speaker 3>that's pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's pretty bare bones,</v>

1481
01:32:22.601 --> 01:32:23.980
<v Speaker 3>selfconsciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1482
01:32:24.700 --> 01:32:29.700
<v Speaker 3>real self consciousness is the knowledge</v>
<v Speaker 3>of your borders and not only in space </v>

1483
01:32:31.450 --> 01:32:36.450
<v Speaker 3>but in time and as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>human beings are the only creatures that</v>

1484
01:32:36.581 --> 01:32:41.581
<v Speaker 3>have discovered the future and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>really good because we can plan for the </v>

1485
01:32:41.581 --> 01:32:42.580
<v Speaker 3>future,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's really bad because you know,</v>

1486
01:32:44.410 --> 01:32:49.410
<v Speaker 3>the future is finite and that's like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a big shock to the old system and</v>

1487
01:32:50.871 --> 01:32:55.871
<v Speaker 3>it's the existential burden that </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone bears and its associated </v>

1488
01:32:55.871 --> 01:32:57.260
<v Speaker 3>integrity with suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so then you think,</v>

1489
01:32:57.261 --> 01:33:02.261
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>life is suffering and it's finite and </v>

1490
01:33:02.261 --> 01:33:04.541
<v Speaker 3>that's part of the suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's part of what you makes you </v>

1491
01:33:04.541 --> 01:33:07.781
<v Speaker 3>question the value of existing and maybe</v>
<v Speaker 3>the value of existence itself.</v>

1492
01:33:09.720 --> 01:33:12.930
<v Speaker 3>So then what do you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were used as a weapon against that?</v>

1493
01:33:13.470 --> 01:33:14.010
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1494
01:33:14.011 --> 01:33:16.020
<v Speaker 3>we talked a little bit about </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibility.</v>

1495
01:33:16.430 --> 01:33:18.100
<v Speaker 3>Now it seems to work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1496
01:33:21.510 --> 01:33:26.510
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the amount of responsibility that you </v>

1497
01:33:26.510 --> 01:33:26.510
<v Speaker 3>adopt</v>

1498
01:33:26.510 --> 01:33:31.450
<v Speaker 3>with really in relationship to things </v>
<v Speaker 3>seems to increase your meaningful </v>

1499
01:33:32.391 --> 01:33:33.590
<v Speaker 3>engagement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you might say,</v>

1500
01:33:33.591 --> 01:33:38.300
<v Speaker 3>well what's the most meaningfully </v>
<v Speaker 3>engaged activity?</v>

1501
01:33:38.301 --> 01:33:43.301
<v Speaker 3>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well how about little reduction in the </v>

1502
01:33:43.301 --> 01:33:44.810
<v Speaker 3>old suffering?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1503
01:33:45.350 --> 01:33:49.880
<v Speaker 3>So you live your life so that you're not</v>
<v Speaker 3>causing undue pain,</v>

1504
01:33:50.030 --> 01:33:52.520
<v Speaker 3>especially pointless pain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be good.</v>

1505
01:33:52.521 --> 01:33:54.980
<v Speaker 3>And maybe you could even be more useful </v>
<v Speaker 3>than that.</v>

1506
01:33:54.981 --> 01:33:58.880
<v Speaker 3>And you could figure out some ways that </v>
<v Speaker 3>some suffering years,</v>

1507
01:33:58.881 --> 01:34:01.580
<v Speaker 3>other people's both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're really,</v>

1508
01:34:02.600 --> 01:34:04.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hitting a home run,</v>

1509
01:34:05.030 --> 01:34:08.060
<v Speaker 3>maybe you can figure out some way that </v>
<v Speaker 3>some of that can be rectified.</v>

1510
01:34:08.061 --> 01:34:12.410
<v Speaker 3>And that seems to be meaningful in and </v>
<v Speaker 3>of itself.</v>

1511
01:34:12.411 --> 01:34:17.411
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's pain that makes you doubt the </v>

1512
01:34:17.411 --> 01:34:17.411
<v Speaker 3>meaning of life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is perfectly reasonable,</v>

1513
01:34:18.860 --> 01:34:23.690
<v Speaker 3>then the cessation of pain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cessation of suffering,</v>

1514
01:34:23.691 --> 01:34:28.691
<v Speaker 3>the minimization of suffering as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>logical corollary should be the proper </v>

1515
01:34:29.900 --> 01:34:34.900
<v Speaker 3>medication.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I would say that means that </v>

1516
01:34:34.900 --> 01:34:39.250
<v Speaker 3>there's some mode that you can conduct </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself in that makes you a good </v>

1517
01:34:40.671 --> 01:34:41.210
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>

1518
01:34:42.450 --> 01:34:42.870
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

1519
01:34:44.050 --> 01:34:48.550
<v Speaker 3>part of being a good person is to </v>
<v Speaker 3>alleviate suffering.</v>

1520
01:34:49.850 --> 01:34:50.150
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

1521
01:34:52.650 --> 01:34:55.020
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you get to question that </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually.</v>

1522
01:34:55.021 --> 01:35:00.021
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the suffering itself is making you </v>

1523
01:35:00.021 --> 01:35:00.021
<v Speaker 3>question</v>

1524
01:35:00.021 --> 01:35:03.010
<v Speaker 1>the validity of your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can't also say that the </v>

1525
01:35:03.010 --> 01:35:05.810
<v Speaker 1>cessation of that is not useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can,</v>

1526
01:35:05.811 --> 01:35:07.860
<v Speaker 1>but it's completely incoherent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can.</v>

1527
01:35:08.020 --> 01:35:09.950
<v Speaker 1>You can claim incoherent things if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>

1528
01:35:15.410 --> 01:35:20.410
<v Speaker 1>So then I would say these distilled </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories that I'm talking about,</v>

1529
01:35:23.660 --> 01:35:25.880
<v Speaker 1>the stories that are written by great </v>
<v Speaker 1>authors,</v>

1530
01:35:27.540 --> 01:35:32.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm particularly fond of Dostoevsky </v>
<v Speaker 1>whose,</v>

1531
01:35:32.680 --> 01:35:37.680
<v Speaker 1>whose works are he's head and shoulders </v>
<v Speaker 1>above anyone I've ever read in terms of</v>

1532
01:35:40.460 --> 01:35:44.720
<v Speaker 1>writers of fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He deals with the hardest questions that</v>

1533
01:35:44.721 --> 01:35:48.190
<v Speaker 1>human beings face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he,</v>

1534
01:35:48.960 --> 01:35:51.200
<v Speaker 1>he has characters on both sides of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument.</v>

1535
01:35:51.201 --> 01:35:54.260
<v Speaker 1>And there they really lay out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>arguments.</v>

1536
01:35:54.261 --> 01:35:55.560
<v Speaker 1>It's not like Dostoyevsky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1537
01:35:55.580 --> 01:36:00.580
<v Speaker 1>he has got a belief and so he has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>character and that character has his </v>

1538
01:36:00.580 --> 01:36:04.841
<v Speaker 1>beliefs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that character always wins the </v>

1539
01:36:04.841 --> 01:36:04.841
<v Speaker 1>arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1540
01:36:04.841 --> 01:36:04.841
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't happen in the Dostoyevsky </v>
<v Speaker 1>novel at all.</v>

1541
01:36:04.841 --> 01:36:09.730
<v Speaker 1>He sets up a character and then he sets </v>
<v Speaker 1>up like three or four antagonists and </v>

1542
01:36:09.730 --> 01:36:10.700
<v Speaker 1>those antagonists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not straw man.</v>

1543
01:36:10.701 --> 01:36:14.000
<v Speaker 1>They're like iron giants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just stomp his,</v>

1544
01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:15.890
<v Speaker 1>his protagonist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1545
01:36:15.891 --> 01:36:20.450
<v Speaker 1>in the whole thing is a war between </v>
<v Speaker 1>these different conceptions of being.</v>

1546
01:36:20.850 --> 01:36:23.030
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing to see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing to read.</v>

1547
01:36:24.170 --> 01:36:24.540
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1548
01:36:30.540 --> 01:36:34.920
<v Speaker 1>so you distill these stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great authors distill stories,</v>

1549
01:36:35.550 --> 01:36:39.450
<v Speaker 1>great storytellers distill stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we have stories that are very,</v>

1550
01:36:39.451 --> 01:36:40.020
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

1551
01:36:40.021 --> 01:36:45.021
<v Speaker 1>very old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are usually religious stories of </v>

1552
01:36:45.021 --> 01:36:46.770
<v Speaker 1>one form or another particular be fairy </v>
<v Speaker 1>tales because fairy tales,</v>

1553
01:36:46.771 --> 01:36:49.120
<v Speaker 1>some people have traced fairytales,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1554
01:36:49.230 --> 01:36:50.520
<v Speaker 1>more than 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

1555
01:36:50.940 --> 01:36:55.940
<v Speaker 1>And so they're part of an oral tradition</v>
<v Speaker 1>and oral traditions can last for tens of</v>

1556
01:36:56.251 --> 01:36:58.370
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1557
01:36:58.530 --> 01:37:02.400
<v Speaker 1>it's a story that's been told for 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years is a funny kind of story.</v>

1558
01:37:02.401 --> 01:37:06.420
<v Speaker 1>It's like people have remembered it and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and obviously modified it.</v>

1559
01:37:06.421 --> 01:37:08.640
<v Speaker 1>It's like the game of telephone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1560
01:37:08.641 --> 01:37:13.641
<v Speaker 1>where I to tell you something and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>whispered to the person next to you and </v>

1561
01:37:13.641 --> 01:37:16.821
<v Speaker 1>so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a game of telephone that's </v>

1562
01:37:16.821 --> 01:37:16.821
<v Speaker 1>going on for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1563
01:37:16.821 --> 01:37:21.170
<v Speaker 1>thousand generations and all that's left</v>
<v Speaker 1>is what people remember and maybe they </v>

1564
01:37:21.991 --> 01:37:24.930
<v Speaker 1>remember what's important because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>tend to remember what's important.</v>

1565
01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:27.240
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't necessarily the case that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1566
01:37:27.241 --> 01:37:29.850
<v Speaker 1>what the hell it means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what music means,</v>

1567
01:37:30.750 --> 01:37:33.780
<v Speaker 1>but you know that's a stop you from </v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to it.</v>

1568
01:37:34.230 --> 01:37:36.390
<v Speaker 1>You don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking,</v>

1569
01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:40.950
<v Speaker 1>what a movie that you see or a book that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you read means not if it's profound.</v>

1570
01:37:41.160 --> 01:37:45.000
<v Speaker 1>It means more than you can understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise why read it?</v>

1571
01:37:46.990 --> 01:37:48.370
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea is this,</v>

1572
01:37:48.371 --> 01:37:53.371
<v Speaker 1>is that were necessarily nested inside </v>
<v Speaker 1>moral systems.</v>

1573
01:37:54.010 --> 01:37:58.380
<v Speaker 1>The moral systems are on narratives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative,</v>

1574
01:37:58.381 --> 01:38:03.381
<v Speaker 1>dramas of sorts and the moral systems or</v>
<v Speaker 1>what orients us in life.</v>

1575
01:38:04.681 --> 01:38:09.681
<v Speaker 1>And the reason to understand them to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>degree that you can is because you need </v>

1576
01:38:09.681 --> 01:38:13.970
<v Speaker 1>to know how to live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nisha said that if you had a,</v>

1577
01:38:14.310 --> 01:38:17.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why you could bear anyhow.</v>

1578
01:38:19.110 --> 01:38:19.280
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

1579
01:38:20.120 --> 01:38:25.120
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that the Auschwitz </v>

1580
01:38:25.120 --> 01:38:25.960
<v Speaker 1>guards used to do to the prisoners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is very telling,</v>

1581
01:38:26.230 --> 01:38:30.460
<v Speaker 1>so at Auschwitz there was a sign that </v>
<v Speaker 1>said work will make you free.</v>

1582
01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:35.560
<v Speaker 1>It was a little joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not really a very funny joke,</v>

1583
01:38:37.260 --> 01:38:42.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the kind of joke that you have to </v>

1584
01:38:42.260 --> 01:38:44.371
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say tannic is the appropriate term to </v>

1585
01:38:45.140 --> 01:38:48.410
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize and to dare to,</v>

1586
01:38:50.020 --> 01:38:55.020
<v Speaker 1>to just state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when our Switz prisoners came to </v>

1587
01:38:55.301 --> 01:38:56.140
<v Speaker 1>Auschwitz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1588
01:38:56.141 --> 01:38:58.390
<v Speaker 1>they're already pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty rough shape.</v>

1589
01:38:58.391 --> 01:39:03.391
<v Speaker 1>They were in cattle cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd been separated from their </v>

1590
01:39:03.391 --> 01:39:03.391
<v Speaker 1>families.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything had been taken from them.</v>

1591
01:39:03.391 --> 01:39:05.890
<v Speaker 1>They were transported for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were standing up,</v>

1592
01:39:06.130 --> 01:39:08.290
<v Speaker 1>the kids were suffocating because there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was no room in the,</v>

1593
01:39:08.320 --> 01:39:09.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was so packed in there.</v>

1594
01:39:09.910 --> 01:39:14.910
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have anything to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There weren't any toilet facilities of </v>

1595
01:39:14.910 --> 01:39:16.420
<v Speaker 1>any sort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like you got rid of 20 percent of</v>

1596
01:39:16.421 --> 01:39:18.340
<v Speaker 1>the people just transporting them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1597
01:39:18.341 --> 01:39:21.820
<v Speaker 1>the ones on the outside of the cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they froze to death because of course it</v>

1598
01:39:21.821 --> 01:39:26.821
<v Speaker 1>was cold and pretty nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when they got to Auschwitz,</v>

1599
01:39:27.460 --> 01:39:32.460
<v Speaker 1>the guards used to have this game that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they would play and this is part of the </v>

1600
01:39:32.460 --> 01:39:35.320
<v Speaker 1>work will set you free thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would get a prisoner,</v>

1601
01:39:35.321 --> 01:39:40.321
<v Speaker 1>they take a prisoner who's already in </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty rough shape and then have them </v>

1602
01:39:41.501 --> 01:39:46.501
<v Speaker 1>carry a sack of wet salt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 pounds from one side of the camp to </v>

1603
01:39:46.501 --> 01:39:47.710
<v Speaker 1>the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1604
01:39:47.980 --> 01:39:52.980
<v Speaker 1>when you think of a camp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think of something like a football </v>

1605
01:39:52.980 --> 01:39:52.980
<v Speaker 1>field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1606
01:39:52.980 --> 01:39:53.080
<v Speaker 1>maybe something that big fences around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1607
01:39:53.081 --> 01:39:54.700
<v Speaker 1>no way man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these were cities.</v>

1608
01:39:54.701 --> 01:39:59.701
<v Speaker 1>These were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were tens of thousands of people </v>

1609
01:39:59.701 --> 01:39:59.950
<v Speaker 1>in these places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So from one side of the camp compound to</v>

1610
01:39:59.951 --> 01:40:02.500
<v Speaker 1>the other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a good hike and that wasn't bad</v>

1611
01:40:02.501 --> 01:40:07.501
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had to get them to carry it back </v>

1612
01:40:07.501 --> 01:40:07.501
<v Speaker 1>and put it in the same place.</v>

1613
01:40:09.100 --> 01:40:09.580
<v Speaker 2>Now</v>

1614
01:40:13.400 --> 01:40:17.630
<v Speaker 1>that's poetic and it's malevolence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1615
01:40:17.631 --> 01:40:22.631
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing is you're harnessing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the human compulsion to engage in useful</v>

1616
01:40:26.781 --> 01:40:31.781
<v Speaker 1>activity and demonstrating how </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely futile that is despite its </v>

1617
01:40:34.311 --> 01:40:39.311
<v Speaker 1>difficulty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seems like a bad thing to do.</v>

1618
01:40:45.610 --> 01:40:49.620
<v Speaker 1>People need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a parody of meaninglessness.</v>

1619
01:40:49.621 --> 01:40:51.690
<v Speaker 1>That's what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1620
01:40:51.691 --> 01:40:54.460
<v Speaker 1>people need meaning in their because </v>
<v Speaker 1>their lives are difficult.</v>

1621
01:40:55.240 --> 01:40:59.830
<v Speaker 3>And so the question is to what end </v>
<v Speaker 3>should you devote your life?</v>

1622
01:41:00.970 --> 01:41:02.430
<v Speaker 3>And another question might be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1623
01:41:02.440 --> 01:41:05.530
<v Speaker 3>does it matter?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Matters an interesting word,</v>

1624
01:41:05.531 --> 01:41:10.330
<v Speaker 3>a because matter is matter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but matter is also what matters.</v>

1625
01:41:11.710 --> 01:41:15.070
<v Speaker 3>And I would say that what matters is </v>
<v Speaker 3>more real than matter.</v>

1626
01:41:16.180 --> 01:41:18.430
<v Speaker 3>At least that's how you act.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the question is,</v>

1627
01:41:18.431 --> 01:41:23.431
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there something you should be aiming </v>

1628
01:41:23.431 --> 01:41:24.240
<v Speaker 3>at?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good question.</v>

1629
01:41:24.660 --> 01:41:26.610
<v Speaker 3>That's the question of the meaning of </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

1630
01:41:28.350 --> 01:41:33.350
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that supposed to </v>

1631
01:41:33.350 --> 01:41:35.091
<v Speaker 3>happen when you come to university is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that that's the sort of question that </v>

1632
01:41:35.091 --> 01:41:35.820
<v Speaker 3>should be addressed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as far as I can tell,</v>

1633
01:41:36.790 --> 01:41:39.120
<v Speaker 3>and this might just be my more cynical </v>
<v Speaker 3>side,</v>

1634
01:41:39.121 --> 01:41:42.000
<v Speaker 3>what I see happening to university </v>
<v Speaker 3>students generally speaking,</v>

1635
01:41:42.001 --> 01:41:47.001
<v Speaker 3>is that they come in clinging to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>wreckage of their culture and floating </v>

1636
01:41:50.370 --> 01:41:55.370
<v Speaker 3>with the pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And those pieces are taken away by </v>

1637
01:41:56.950 --> 01:42:01.950
<v Speaker 3>professors who tell them that everything</v>
<v Speaker 3>can be deconstructed and no,</v>

1638
01:42:02.830 --> 01:42:07.830
<v Speaker 3>nothing has any real meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like when you're finally </v>

1639
01:42:07.830 --> 01:42:11.041
<v Speaker 3>educated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's when you're floating out on the </v>

1640
01:42:11.041 --> 01:42:11.041
<v Speaker 3>ocean and you've got nothing to stay </v>
<v Speaker 3>afloat with.</v>

1641
01:42:11.041 --> 01:42:11.500
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well then you're,</v>

1642
01:42:11.540 --> 01:42:12.960
<v Speaker 3>you're done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you congratulate.</v>

1643
01:42:12.970 --> 01:42:13.540
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>

1644
01:42:17.870 --> 01:42:22.190
<v Speaker 3>I don't see that as useful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Quite the contrary.</v>

1645
01:42:31.150 --> 01:42:32.410
<v Speaker 3>So let me tell you a story.</v>

1646
01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:42.120
<v Speaker 3>The first thing I'm going to propose to </v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1647
01:42:42.121 --> 01:42:47.121
<v Speaker 3>and we'll talk about this a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that you inhabit a story that the </v>

1648
01:42:47.121 --> 01:42:49.380
<v Speaker 3>framework through which you look at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world is actually a story.</v>

1649
01:42:49.381 --> 01:42:54.270
<v Speaker 3>And here's the story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The story is you're somewhere and you're</v>

1650
01:42:54.271 --> 01:42:55.890
<v Speaker 3>going somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even.</v>

1651
01:42:55.891 --> 01:42:57.650
<v Speaker 3>That can be conceptual or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's that.</v>

1652
01:42:57.990 --> 01:43:00.940
<v Speaker 3>But there's a gradient between where you</v>
<v Speaker 3>are and what were aiming at,</v>

1653
01:43:00.980 --> 01:43:03.630
<v Speaker 3>which means no more really than you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing something.</v>

1654
01:43:03.631 --> 01:43:08.631
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're sitting there and hypothetically </v>

1655
01:43:08.631 --> 01:43:11.331
<v Speaker 3>you're aiming for something better and </v>
<v Speaker 3>so you're in a state of insufficiency.</v>

1656
01:43:11.670 --> 01:43:15.000
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the DNS sufficiencies change?</v>

1657
01:43:15.900 --> 01:43:20.900
<v Speaker 3>And then you're trying to rectify the </v>
<v Speaker 3>insufficiency and you presume that your </v>

1658
01:43:20.900 --> 01:43:22.620
<v Speaker 3>current state is less preferable to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>state that you're aiming at.</v>

1659
01:43:23.340 --> 01:43:28.340
<v Speaker 3>And then the way that you bring those </v>
<v Speaker 3>two together is sometimes you can do it </v>

1660
01:43:29.311 --> 01:43:34.311
<v Speaker 3>through thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but fundamentally you do it through </v>

1661
01:43:34.311 --> 01:43:34.311
<v Speaker 3>action.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You do it through acting in the world.</v>

1662
01:43:34.311 --> 01:43:39.111
<v Speaker 3>And so that's sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's sort of the answer in some sense </v>

1663
01:43:39.111 --> 01:43:40.890
<v Speaker 3>to the mind body problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have a conceptual structure,</v>

1664
01:43:41.100 --> 01:43:43.010
<v Speaker 3>but when you implement it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1665
01:43:43.040 --> 01:43:45.090
<v Speaker 3>you're implementing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not abstract,</v>

1666
01:43:45.100 --> 01:43:46.680
<v Speaker 3>but you're implementing it through </v>
<v Speaker 3>action.</v>

1667
01:43:46.681 --> 01:43:49.830
<v Speaker 3>And so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the basic story.</v>

1668
01:43:49.860 --> 01:43:51.950
<v Speaker 3>It's not a very interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

1669
01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:54.050
<v Speaker 1>it's the framework through which you </v>
<v Speaker 1>view the world.</v>

1670
01:43:54.051 --> 01:43:59.051
<v Speaker 1>So it's a value laden framework,</v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise you wouldn't be able to act </v>

1671
01:43:59.051 --> 01:44:01.640
<v Speaker 1>and you wouldn't know what to look at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a value laden framework.</v>

1672
01:44:01.940 --> 01:44:04.110
<v Speaker 1>You look at the world through a value </v>
<v Speaker 1>laden framework.</v>

1673
01:44:04.111 --> 01:44:05.000
<v Speaker 1>So then we might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1674
01:44:05.001 --> 01:44:07.280
<v Speaker 1>what is the optimal Value Laden </v>
<v Speaker 1>framework?</v>

1675
01:44:07.580 --> 01:44:09.170
<v Speaker 1>That's what we're going to try to figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

1676
01:44:11.390 --> 01:44:16.390
<v Speaker 1>Now I told you about the war that went </v>
<v Speaker 1>on between the Communists and the way </v>

1677
01:44:17.280 --> 01:44:19.460
<v Speaker 1>Austin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how that obsessed me.</v>

1678
01:44:19.461 --> 01:44:24.350
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that I really </v>
<v Speaker 1>wondered about was what was this just an</v>

1679
01:44:24.380 --> 01:44:26.140
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1680
01:44:26.141 --> 01:44:31.141
<v Speaker 1>like did the Communists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had some axioms and we had some </v>

1681
01:44:31.141 --> 01:44:31.141
<v Speaker 1>axioms and if you're a moral relativist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>

1682
01:44:31.141 --> 01:44:36.041
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's to say which set of axioms are </v>

1683
01:44:36.041 --> 01:44:39.041
<v Speaker 1>better?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or even who's to claim that you could </v>

1684
01:44:39.041 --> 01:44:40.460
<v Speaker 1>say that a set of axioms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one set is better than another.</v>

1685
01:44:41.510 --> 01:44:45.170
<v Speaker 1>That's a moral relative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this claim and know fair enough.</v>

1686
01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:56.350
<v Speaker 1>So I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe this is just an arbitrary </v>

1687
01:44:56.350 --> 01:44:58.421
<v Speaker 1>thing and it's going to be settled by </v>
<v Speaker 1>force because that's how you settle an </v>

1688
01:44:58.421 --> 01:45:02.201
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary claim between two competing </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems where there's no room for </v>

1689
01:45:02.201 --> 01:45:03.620
<v Speaker 1>negotiation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I thought about that for a long time.</v>

1690
01:45:03.621 --> 01:45:08.621
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to know what the roots were of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Marxist system and what the roots </v>

1691
01:45:09.080 --> 01:45:13.760
<v Speaker 1>were of the Western system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what I surmised was that the western</v>

1692
01:45:13.761 --> 01:45:16.490
<v Speaker 1>system was actually something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolved.</v>

1693
01:45:17.510 --> 01:45:22.510
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the communist system was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rationalist construction that was </v>

1694
01:45:22.510 --> 01:45:25.040
<v Speaker 1>imposed and they weren't the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then I wondered,</v>

1695
01:45:25.310 --> 01:45:30.310
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's western culture grounded in and </v>

1696
01:45:30.310 --> 01:45:32.060
<v Speaker 1>is there any reason to assume that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's real in any sense?</v>

1697
01:45:32.660 --> 01:45:37.660
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what took me into this </v>
<v Speaker 1>study of the underlying stories.</v>

1698
01:45:38.790 --> 01:45:41.330
<v Speaker 1>The fundamental stories upon which our </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>

1699
01:45:41.570 --> 01:45:43.790
<v Speaker 1>I believe is based and some of those are</v>
<v Speaker 1>very old.</v>

1700
01:45:44.620 --> 01:45:46.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tell you a Mesopotamian </v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

1701
01:45:46.461 --> 01:45:49.280
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the oldest stories we know </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tell you an Egyptian story.</v>

1702
01:45:50.770 --> 01:45:55.430
<v Speaker 1>Those are sources of our culture and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think those stories are grounded in much</v>

1703
01:45:55.431 --> 01:46:00.431
<v Speaker 1>older traditions and I think they refer </v>
<v Speaker 1>to something real actually real.</v>

1704
01:46:00.860 --> 01:46:03.560
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I already told you that</v>

1705
01:46:05.410 --> 01:46:10.410
<v Speaker 1>there are different ways of </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualizing real and that my initial</v>

1706
01:46:10.601 --> 01:46:12.220
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>presumption,</v>

1707
01:46:12.250 --> 01:46:14.020
<v Speaker 1>axiom you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that okay,</v>

1708
01:46:16.060 --> 01:46:19.390
<v Speaker 1>pain is the most real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason I believe that is because</v>

1709
01:46:19.391 --> 01:46:23.170
<v Speaker 1>that's how people act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you can criticize that.</v>

1710
01:46:24.190 --> 01:46:29.190
<v Speaker 1>You can certainly come up with an </v>
<v Speaker 1>alternative conceptual framework which </v>

1711
01:46:29.190 --> 01:46:30.640
<v Speaker 1>the scientists have because they believe</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the most real thing is mattered.</v>

1712
01:46:33.440 --> 01:46:36.350
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we need more than one set of tools</v>
<v Speaker 1>to operate in the world.</v>

1713
01:46:37.270 --> 01:46:38.060
<v Speaker 1>It's possible.</v>

1714
01:46:45.010 --> 01:46:50.010
<v Speaker 1>So now I want to tell you what I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental constituent elements are</v>

1715
01:46:50.641 --> 01:46:55.641
<v Speaker 1>of stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things that I hope is </v>

1716
01:46:56.191 --> 01:47:01.191
<v Speaker 1>that this knowing this will make you </v>
<v Speaker 1>immunize,</v>

1717
01:47:02.400 --> 01:47:07.400
<v Speaker 1>immunize you against ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason am because I believe that</v>

1718
01:47:07.601 --> 01:47:11.610
<v Speaker 1>the ideologies are fragmentary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meta narratives,</v>

1719
01:47:11.760 --> 01:47:15.240
<v Speaker 1>and they have their power because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're grounded in the Meta narrative,</v>

1720
01:47:15.241 --> 01:47:20.241
<v Speaker 1>but they only tell part of the story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they have power because they're </v>

1721
01:47:20.241 --> 01:47:23.430
<v Speaker 1>grounded in the fundamental narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so here's the fundamental America as</v>

1722
01:47:23.431 --> 01:47:27.990
<v Speaker 1>far as the characters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say we're going to say that people</v>

1723
01:47:27.991 --> 01:47:32.250
<v Speaker 1>are prone to characterize the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>where social primates,</v>

1724
01:47:32.251 --> 01:47:37.251
<v Speaker 1>we're social cognitive primates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we tend to see the world through the </v>

1725
01:47:37.251 --> 01:47:40.971
<v Speaker 1>lens of a social creature and so and </v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because we're concerned with </v>

1726
01:47:40.971 --> 01:47:43.110
<v Speaker 1>acting in the world and the world is </v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly other people.</v>

1727
01:47:43.410 --> 01:47:48.410
<v Speaker 1>Then we conceptualize the ground of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure for action in </v>

1728
01:47:48.721 --> 01:47:50.070
<v Speaker 1>characterological terms.</v>

1729
01:47:54.150 --> 01:47:59.150
<v Speaker 1>So the the most fundamental reality is </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos and chaos is what you don't </v>

1730
01:48:01.861 --> 01:48:05.820
<v Speaker 1>understand at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't even conceptualize it.</v>

1731
01:48:06.560 --> 01:48:11.560
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you come into contact with it in bits </v>

1732
01:48:11.560 --> 01:48:13.470
<v Speaker 1>and pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the twin towers fell,</v>

1733
01:48:13.471 --> 01:48:17.310
<v Speaker 1>when the twin towers fell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos reigned for a few days.</v>

1734
01:48:17.400 --> 01:48:20.760
<v Speaker 1>Everyone was shellshocked and that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos.</v>

1735
01:48:20.820 --> 01:48:25.440
<v Speaker 1>And Chaos is what you experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When your story falls apart,</v>

1736
01:48:26.500 --> 01:48:29.880
<v Speaker 1>and that's a descent to the underworld.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's chaos.</v>

1737
01:48:30.150 --> 01:48:34.530
<v Speaker 1>And basically you live in order and </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos in order is where when you do what</v>

1738
01:48:34.531 --> 01:48:38.040
<v Speaker 1>you think you should do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you want to have happen happens,</v>

1739
01:48:38.340 --> 01:48:43.340
<v Speaker 1>that's ordered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's explored territory and chaos is </v>

1740
01:48:43.340 --> 01:48:46.551
<v Speaker 1>when you do what you're supposed to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get what you want and it doesn't </v>

1741
01:48:46.551 --> 01:48:51.081
<v Speaker 1>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then that place that you're </v>

1742
01:48:51.081 --> 01:48:51.081
<v Speaker 1>magically in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When that happens,</v>

1743
01:48:51.081 --> 01:48:53.370
<v Speaker 1>that's chaos and it has different depths</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could say.</v>

1744
01:48:53.580 --> 01:48:58.580
<v Speaker 1>It reaches all the way to hell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that usually happens when your life </v>

1745
01:48:58.580 --> 01:49:02.781
<v Speaker 1>falls apart very badly and you're down </v>
<v Speaker 1>in that chaos and you realized that it </v>

1746
01:49:02.781 --> 01:49:07.230
<v Speaker 1>was your fault and that you did </v>
<v Speaker 1>something wrong and that you knew it and</v>

1747
01:49:07.231 --> 01:49:11.250
<v Speaker 1>you ignored it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the worst form of chaos.</v>

1748
01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:18.960
<v Speaker 1>So there's chaos itself and then then </v>
<v Speaker 1>the next thing is fairly </v>

1749
01:49:18.960 --> 01:49:21.400
<v Speaker 1>straightforward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could think there's the individual,</v>

1750
01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:26.170
<v Speaker 1>the individual exist in culture and </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture is embedded in nature.</v>

1751
01:49:26.770 --> 01:49:29.260
<v Speaker 1>Pretty straightforward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nature is mother nature.</v>

1752
01:49:29.261 --> 01:49:32.650
<v Speaker 1>For reasons we'll get into and culture </v>
<v Speaker 1>is father culture.</v>

1753
01:49:33.340 --> 01:49:38.340
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental dominance hierarchies in </v>

1754
01:49:38.340 --> 01:49:41.970
<v Speaker 1>human primates are masculine and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature is assimilated to the feminine </v>

1755
01:49:42.761 --> 01:49:45.850
<v Speaker 1>because it's all for two reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

1756
01:49:45.851 --> 01:49:48.370
<v Speaker 1>females do the sexual among human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>

1757
01:49:48.371 --> 01:49:51.460
<v Speaker 1>So they actually are nature from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Darwinian perspective.</v>

1758
01:49:51.461 --> 01:49:56.020
<v Speaker 1>And second nature is the productive </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological force.</v>

1759
01:49:56.590 --> 01:50:01.590
<v Speaker 1>And so we've always conceptualize males </v>
<v Speaker 1>and females and we've used that </v>

1760
01:50:01.590 --> 01:50:05.341
<v Speaker 1>conceptualization to sort out the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>at large.</v>

1761
01:50:06.340 --> 01:50:09.460
<v Speaker 1>It's a metaphor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not just a metaphor,</v>

1762
01:50:09.461 --> 01:50:13.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's reasonable to consider culture as a</v>

1763
01:50:13.031 --> 01:50:18.031
<v Speaker 1>judgmental father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really reasonable because you know </v>

1764
01:50:18.700 --> 01:50:20.980
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a group of people around you,</v>

1765
01:50:21.100 --> 01:50:23.320
<v Speaker 1>some friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people that watch you work,</v>

1766
01:50:23.321 --> 01:50:28.321
<v Speaker 1>some judges,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that stretches across a very long </v>

1767
01:50:28.321 --> 01:50:31.210
<v Speaker 1>expanse of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those people as an aggregate make an</v>

1768
01:50:31.211 --> 01:50:35.320
<v Speaker 1>entity that is judging your reputation </v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly.</v>

1769
01:50:36.100 --> 01:50:41.100
<v Speaker 1>And it's perfectly reasonable to </v>
<v Speaker 1>personify that because it's like a Meta </v>

1770
01:50:41.100 --> 01:50:45.010
<v Speaker 1>person that's watching you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a useful metaphor.</v>

1771
01:50:45.190 --> 01:50:47.230
<v Speaker 1>There's a metta person that's watching </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1772
01:50:47.500 --> 01:50:47.830
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1773
01:50:47.831 --> 01:50:51.700
<v Speaker 1>there is obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now you could say,</v>

1774
01:50:51.701 --> 01:50:53.170
<v Speaker 1>well that's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like</v>

1775
01:50:56.550 --> 01:50:59.640
<v Speaker 1>it's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way a scientific truth is real,</v>

1776
01:50:59.790 --> 01:51:01.410
<v Speaker 1>it's a different kind of real.</v>

1777
01:51:05.340 --> 01:51:06.780
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature has two elements.</v>

1778
01:51:06.781 --> 01:51:11.781
<v Speaker 1>It's destructive and creative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously there's the beauty of nature </v>

1779
01:51:11.781 --> 01:51:13.980
<v Speaker 1>and it's bountiful element and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1780
01:51:14.250 --> 01:51:19.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an awful east mosquitoes and </v>

1781
01:51:19.250 --> 01:51:22.311
<v Speaker 1>elephantiasis and cancer and starvation </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all the terrible elements of nature </v>

1782
01:51:24.720 --> 01:51:29.720
<v Speaker 1>and then there's culture and culture is </v>
<v Speaker 1>tyrannical because you have to shape </v>

1783
01:51:29.851 --> 01:51:33.540
<v Speaker 1>yourself involuntarily even to get along</v>
<v Speaker 1>with other people.</v>

1784
01:51:33.541 --> 01:51:36.240
<v Speaker 1>You sacrifice a lot of yourself and </v>
<v Speaker 1>develop yourself,</v>

1785
01:51:36.241 --> 01:51:39.060
<v Speaker 1>but you sacrifice a lot of yourself in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that endeavor,</v>

1786
01:51:39.210 --> 01:51:41.820
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to kind of average ourselves out</v>

1787
01:51:41.821 --> 01:51:46.821
<v Speaker 1>in order to to live together and some </v>
<v Speaker 1>societies are more tyrannical than </v>

1788
01:51:46.861 --> 01:51:49.230
<v Speaker 1>others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's always a tyrannical element.</v>

1789
01:51:49.260 --> 01:51:50.670
<v Speaker 1>Do you see that at the university?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1790
01:51:50.671 --> 01:51:53.610
<v Speaker 1>you guys know that to some degree this </v>
<v Speaker 1>is such a big place.</v>

1791
01:51:53.970 --> 01:51:58.970
<v Speaker 1>It's easy to feel like a number here and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that whether or not you're here or not </v>

1792
01:51:58.970 --> 01:51:59.790
<v Speaker 1>doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Institution doesn't care.</v>

1793
01:52:00.390 --> 01:52:02.160
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the tyrannical element of it.</v>

1794
01:52:02.190 --> 01:52:07.190
<v Speaker 1>Now what does care?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because here you are and you're getting </v>

1795
01:52:07.190 --> 01:52:07.380
<v Speaker 1>educated and all that and so maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's positive,</v>

1796
01:52:08.310 --> 01:52:09.750
<v Speaker 1>but it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got both.</v>

1797
01:52:10.230 --> 01:52:15.230
<v Speaker 1>These characters always have two sides,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know there's does negative side in </v>

1798
01:52:15.241 --> 01:52:20.241
<v Speaker 1>the positive side of nature and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the negative side,</v>

1799
01:52:20.370 --> 01:52:22.710
<v Speaker 1>the positive side of culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's the individual,</v>

1800
01:52:22.711 --> 01:52:26.340
<v Speaker 1>so the individual is like standing on an</v>
<v Speaker 1>island in the midst of an ocean.</v>

1801
01:52:27.070 --> 01:52:27.750
<v Speaker 1>That's a good</v>

1802
01:52:29.670 --> 01:52:32.430
<v Speaker 1>imagistic conceptualization of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>position.</v>

1803
01:52:33.090 --> 01:52:38.090
<v Speaker 1>There's solid ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has a limited expanse and outside of </v>

1804
01:52:38.090 --> 01:52:41.550
<v Speaker 1>that is everything you don't understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you as an individual have a positive</v>

1805
01:52:41.551 --> 01:52:45.090
<v Speaker 1>and negative elements as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the hero and the villain.</v>

1806
01:52:45.580 --> 01:52:50.580
<v Speaker 1>And of course what good is this story </v>
<v Speaker 1>without a hero and a villain and the </v>

1807
01:52:50.580 --> 01:52:54.161
<v Speaker 1>villain is the person who isn't acting </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a person should act in the hero is </v>

1808
01:52:54.161 --> 01:52:54.890
<v Speaker 1>the person who's acting like a person </v>
<v Speaker 1>should act.</v>

1809
01:52:55.250 --> 01:53:00.250
<v Speaker 1>And so you go to movies and you read </v>
<v Speaker 1>books and there's heroes and villains </v>

1810
01:53:00.250 --> 01:53:03.911
<v Speaker 1>and to some degree what you're doing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fleshing out your notion of a </v>

1811
01:53:03.911 --> 01:53:07.781
<v Speaker 1>villain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you read about 30 villains and </v>

1812
01:53:07.781 --> 01:53:07.781
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1813
01:53:07.781 --> 01:53:07.820
<v Speaker 1>there's something villainous about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>villains.</v>

1814
01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:11.810
<v Speaker 1>That's the central element of Villainy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever that is,</v>

1815
01:53:12.230 --> 01:53:17.230
<v Speaker 1>and you could imagine you construct out </v>
<v Speaker 1>a mega villain and a metta hero and </v>

1816
01:53:19.010 --> 01:53:22.220
<v Speaker 1>those are the characters in religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories.</v>

1817
01:53:23.030 --> 01:53:25.130
<v Speaker 1>Generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1818
01:53:25.131 --> 01:53:25.610
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1819
01:53:25.680 --> 01:53:27.710
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the marvel movies,</v>

1820
01:53:29.260 --> 01:53:32.920
<v Speaker 1>there's Odin and Odin has two sons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1821
01:53:33.220 --> 01:53:38.220
<v Speaker 1>Thor and Loki,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thor is like thor is the world redeeming</v>

1822
01:53:43.091 --> 01:53:48.091
<v Speaker 1>hero and Loki is the trickster who wants</v>
<v Speaker 1>to bring everything down and you have to</v>

1823
01:53:48.911 --> 01:53:53.911
<v Speaker 1>recognize that in yourself or it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>useful too because otherwise you </v>

1824
01:53:53.911 --> 01:53:58.020
<v Speaker 1>underestimate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1825
01:53:58.750 --> 01:54:03.750
<v Speaker 1>it's maps of meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive psych.</v>

1826
01:54:09.460 --> 01:54:11.200
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely not that.</v>

1827
01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:19.680
<v Speaker 1>Why might you be villainous?</v>

1828
01:54:21.730 --> 01:54:22.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1829
01:54:22.331 --> 01:54:25.450
<v Speaker 1>because you can be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big deal.</v>

1830
01:54:26.110 --> 01:54:28.870
<v Speaker 1>You can be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually an offshoot of empathy.</v>

1831
01:54:30.220 --> 01:54:32.710
<v Speaker 1>This is something that took me decades </v>
<v Speaker 1>to figure out.</v>

1832
01:54:33.220 --> 01:54:38.220
<v Speaker 1>I figured it out when I was studying the</v>
<v Speaker 1>book of Genesis because in the book of </v>

1833
01:54:38.220 --> 01:54:42.511
<v Speaker 1>Genesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people become self conscious and they </v>

1834
01:54:42.511 --> 01:54:44.110
<v Speaker 1>immediately have the knowledge of good </v>
<v Speaker 1>and evil and I just couldn't figure that</v>

1835
01:54:44.111 --> 01:54:44.740
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1836
01:54:44.790 --> 01:54:46.870
<v Speaker 1>what the hell's the relationship between</v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

1837
01:54:47.140 --> 01:54:48.490
<v Speaker 1>And then really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tell you,</v>

1838
01:54:48.491 --> 01:54:53.491
<v Speaker 1>I thought about that like for 30 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to puzzle that out and then I </v>

1839
01:54:53.491 --> 01:54:56.990
<v Speaker 1>realized what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're self conscious,</v>

1840
01:54:57.470 --> 01:55:00.920
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can conceptualize yourself as being,</v>

1841
01:55:01.670 --> 01:55:06.670
<v Speaker 1>you know that you are and you know what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like and you know what hurts you </v>

1842
01:55:08.181 --> 01:55:12.050
<v Speaker 1>and what does it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as soon as you know what hurts you,</v>

1843
01:55:13.390 --> 01:55:14.660
<v Speaker 1>you know what hurts her.</v>

1844
01:55:16.110 --> 01:55:21.110
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the knowledge of good and </v>
<v Speaker 1>evil that comes along with being self </v>

1845
01:55:21.110 --> 01:55:24.161
<v Speaker 1>conscious as this is something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinguishes human beings from every </v>

1846
01:55:24.161 --> 01:55:24.900
<v Speaker 1>other animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know a lion will eat you,</v>

1847
01:55:25.470 --> 01:55:28.380
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't really want to tear you </v>
<v Speaker 1>apart slowly,</v>

1848
01:55:28.740 --> 01:55:30.720
<v Speaker 1>just for the fun of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1849
01:55:30.721 --> 01:55:32.850
<v Speaker 1>it eats you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just wants to eat you and you,</v>

1850
01:55:32.870 --> 01:55:34.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could call that evil.</v>

1851
01:55:34.231 --> 01:55:35.820
<v Speaker 1>It sucks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

1852
01:55:36.210 --> 01:55:39.420
<v Speaker 1>But animals are beyond good and evil in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that sense.</v>

1853
01:55:39.421 --> 01:55:40.590
<v Speaker 1>But human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1854
01:55:40.770 --> 01:55:45.770
<v Speaker 1>we can aim our malevolence and we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>really good it because we can imagine </v>

1855
01:55:45.770 --> 01:55:45.770
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this would hurt.</v>

1856
01:55:45.770 --> 01:55:46.800
<v Speaker 1>And if it hurts me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1857
01:55:46.801 --> 01:55:49.290
<v Speaker 1>it's really going to hurt you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1858
01:55:49.291 --> 01:55:52.020
<v Speaker 1>And you need to know that you're like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that because you are like that,</v>

1859
01:55:52.680 --> 01:55:55.470
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't know you're like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or if you don't think you're like that,</v>

1860
01:55:55.620 --> 01:56:00.000
<v Speaker 1>you're even more like that than you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think because of the people who are most</v>

1861
01:56:00.001 --> 01:56:04.550
<v Speaker 1>like that are people who don't think </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like that at all and you have to</v>

1862
01:56:04.551 --> 01:56:09.551
<v Speaker 1>contend with that and that's why in many</v>
<v Speaker 1>systems of thinking the world is </v>

1863
01:56:09.651 --> 01:56:14.651
<v Speaker 1>conceptualized as a battle between good </v>
<v Speaker 1>and evil and it's inappropriate </v>

1864
01:56:14.651 --> 01:56:14.930
<v Speaker 1>conceptualization.</v>

1865
01:56:16.490 --> 01:56:21.490
<v Speaker 1>It's a medic conceptualization and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture is the wise king in the tyrant </v>

1866
01:56:22.091 --> 01:56:27.091
<v Speaker 1>and that's always the case and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>always stuck with that because as an </v>

1867
01:56:27.091 --> 01:56:28.450
<v Speaker 1>individual with your negative side and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your positive side,</v>

1868
01:56:28.550 --> 01:56:33.550
<v Speaker 1>the negative side is the resentful side </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is irritated that the limited </v>

1869
01:56:33.550 --> 01:56:38.371
<v Speaker 1>conditions of being and the suffering </v>
<v Speaker 1>that entails and it's arbitrary and </v>

1870
01:56:38.371 --> 01:56:42.661
<v Speaker 1>unfair nature and no wonder you got that</v>
<v Speaker 1>side has a case to make.</v>

1871
01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:48.580
<v Speaker 1>It's not trivial in in the brothers </v>
<v Speaker 1>Karamazov.</v>

1872
01:56:49.150 --> 01:56:54.150
<v Speaker 1>That argument is laid out beautifully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a character Alioscha who's a </v>

1873
01:56:54.150 --> 01:56:55.110
<v Speaker 1>monk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>monastery novitiate,</v>

1874
01:56:55.120 --> 01:57:00.120
<v Speaker 1>and not really a sparkling intellect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a very good person and he has a </v>

1875
01:57:00.120 --> 01:57:04.531
<v Speaker 1>brother Ivan and Ivan's a vicious genius</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Ivan just takes silly Osha apart and</v>

1876
01:57:10.631 --> 01:57:13.140
<v Speaker 1>partly he does that by telling a story </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>

1877
01:57:13.141 --> 01:57:18.141
<v Speaker 1>Dostoevsky took this from a news story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The news story was that this mother and </v>

1878
01:57:18.821 --> 01:57:22.960
<v Speaker 1>father had taken their young daughter </v>
<v Speaker 1>and locked her in the outhouse overnight</v>

1879
01:57:23.360 --> 01:57:28.360
<v Speaker 1>when it was like 30 below and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she stayed out there crying and </v>

1880
01:57:28.360 --> 01:57:31.690
<v Speaker 1>screaming and froze to death and Ivan </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically said to Lee Osha,</v>

1881
01:57:31.691 --> 01:57:36.691
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a world in which that could happen,</v>

1882
01:57:37.171 --> 01:57:38.280
<v Speaker 1>should not be.</v>

1883
01:57:41.780 --> 01:57:43.730
<v Speaker 1>That's a good argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1884
01:57:43.731 --> 01:57:46.280
<v Speaker 1>and you can multiply that by millions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>examples.</v>

1885
01:57:47.960 --> 01:57:51.560
<v Speaker 1>So the part of us that is opposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>being and resentful,</v>

1886
01:57:52.950 --> 01:57:54.050
<v Speaker 1>it's got a point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1887
01:57:55.280 --> 01:57:59.630
<v Speaker 1>The problem as far as I can tell is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you act that out,</v>

1888
01:58:00.500 --> 01:58:02.900
<v Speaker 1>then it makes what you're objecting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>

1889
01:58:03.830 --> 01:58:06.980
<v Speaker 1>Now you might be happy about that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think,</v>

1890
01:58:06.981 --> 01:58:11.981
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people couldn't be consciously pursuing </v>

1891
01:58:11.981 --> 01:58:11.981
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yes they can.</v>

1892
01:58:12.170 --> 01:58:16.040
<v Speaker 1>I would recommend a book called Pans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ram if you're interested in that sort of</v>

1893
01:58:16.041 --> 01:58:21.041
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a book written by a man who raped </v>

1894
01:58:21.041 --> 01:58:23.530
<v Speaker 1>1200 men and killed dozens and burn </v>
<v Speaker 1>things down to the ground every chance </v>

1895
01:58:23.841 --> 01:58:28.841
<v Speaker 1>he got and tried to start a war between </v>
<v Speaker 1>England and the US and who is aimed at </v>

1896
01:58:28.841 --> 01:58:32.630
<v Speaker 1>nothing but may have and he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wrote an autobiography at the request</v>

1897
01:58:32.631 --> 01:58:37.490
<v Speaker 1>of a doctor who had befriended him and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he tells you exactly what he did and why</v>

1898
01:58:45.550 --> 01:58:50.310
<v Speaker 3>the story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Heroin adversary,</v>

1899
01:58:50.430 --> 01:58:55.430
<v Speaker 3>adversary order and tyranny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>destruction and creation.</v>

1900
01:58:58.020 --> 01:59:00.720
<v Speaker 3>That's the basic landscape and outside </v>
<v Speaker 3>of that chaos.</v>

1901
01:59:00.780 --> 01:59:05.780
<v Speaker 3>And so let's take a break.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's another way of looking at this </v>

1902
01:59:07.710 --> 01:59:12.710
<v Speaker 3>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The individual is the person who pays </v>

1903
01:59:15.971 --> 01:59:20.971
<v Speaker 3>attention and explores a masters or who </v>
<v Speaker 3>looks away</v>

1904
01:59:24.360 --> 01:59:24.660
<v Speaker 2>and the</v>

1905
01:59:25.900 --> 01:59:30.900
<v Speaker 3>the person who inhabits and explored </v>
<v Speaker 3>territory and this is unexplored </v>

1906
01:59:31.721 --> 01:59:36.721
<v Speaker 3>territory and so wherever you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's you and to have two halves of </v>

1907
01:59:38.651 --> 01:59:43.651
<v Speaker 3>you that you have to contend with and </v>
<v Speaker 3>wherever you are with people,</v>

1908
01:59:44.891 --> 01:59:49.891
<v Speaker 3>there's the society with its tyrannical </v>
<v Speaker 3>and beneficial nature and the society in</v>

1909
01:59:51.971 --> 01:59:55.840
<v Speaker 3>some senses that match between what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're doing and what's happening.</v>

1910
01:59:55.841 --> 02:00:00.841
<v Speaker 3>It's really important to get that right </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then unexplored territory that's </v>

1911
02:00:00.841 --> 02:00:04.240
<v Speaker 3>wherever and whenever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you're doing stops working.</v>

1912
02:00:05.380 --> 02:00:08.650
<v Speaker 3>And so it's not exactly a geographical </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea,</v>

1913
02:00:08.651 --> 02:00:13.651
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because when you think of explored </v>

1914
02:00:13.651 --> 02:00:15.061
<v Speaker 3>territory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think of geographic landscape like </v>

1915
02:00:15.061 --> 02:00:15.061
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the domain of an animal,</v>

1916
02:00:15.061 --> 02:00:16.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or like your house and you know,</v>

1917
02:00:16.541 --> 02:00:16.960
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1918
02:00:21.430 --> 02:00:24.040
<v Speaker 3>that's definitely an element of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

1919
02:00:24.610 --> 02:00:29.610
<v Speaker 3>if you're in your house and a snake </v>
<v Speaker 3>comes into your living room and you're </v>

1920
02:00:29.610 --> 02:00:29.610
<v Speaker 3>in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1921
02:00:29.610 --> 02:00:32.350
<v Speaker 3>well that's an important difference </v>
<v Speaker 3>between your house.</v>

1922
02:00:32.351 --> 02:00:36.220
<v Speaker 3>One second to go in your house now and </v>
<v Speaker 3>so your house can turn into unexplored,</v>

1923
02:00:36.310 --> 02:00:38.860
<v Speaker 3>unexplored territory at the drop of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>hat,</v>

1924
02:00:38.861 --> 02:00:43.861
<v Speaker 3>and that's because we live in space and </v>
<v Speaker 3>time and so the unexplored territory is </v>

1925
02:00:43.861 --> 02:00:48.750
<v Speaker 3>conceptual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a conceptual territory and it's </v>

1926
02:00:48.750 --> 02:00:52.020
<v Speaker 3>just wherever you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when things aren't working for you the </v>

1927
02:00:52.871 --> 02:00:57.871
<v Speaker 3>way they're supposed to be and so and </v>
<v Speaker 3>these are permanent parts of view,</v>

1928
02:00:58.760 --> 02:01:03.760
<v Speaker 3>the human experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why I think they are </v>

1929
02:01:03.760 --> 02:01:03.760
<v Speaker 3>fundamental characters in our </v>
<v Speaker 3>narratives.</v>

1930
02:01:03.760 --> 02:01:08.460
<v Speaker 3>There's always you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some subject of the story and </v>

1931
02:01:08.460 --> 02:01:10.870
<v Speaker 3>that subject is an ambivalent person </v>
<v Speaker 3>with many different potentials.</v>

1932
02:01:11.110 --> 02:01:15.190
<v Speaker 3>You're always somewhere and with other </v>
<v Speaker 3>people because that's our territory,</v>

1933
02:01:15.191 --> 02:01:18.220
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we're social beyond comprehension</v>

1934
02:01:18.700 --> 02:01:21.190
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even our primate ancestors,</v>

1935
02:01:21.191 --> 02:01:25.840
<v Speaker 3>most of their territory was other </v>
<v Speaker 3>primates and their brains and our brains</v>

1936
02:01:25.990 --> 02:01:30.850
<v Speaker 3>are specialized to view the world as an </v>
<v Speaker 3>aggregation of personalities.</v>

1937
02:01:31.060 --> 02:01:35.410
<v Speaker 3>It's really important to us and so we </v>
<v Speaker 3>tend to view the whole world that way.</v>

1938
02:01:36.100 --> 02:01:39.010
<v Speaker 3>And then unexplored territory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1939
02:01:40.250 --> 02:01:44.630
<v Speaker 1>that's where you don't know what to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>and but you know,</v>

1940
02:01:44.631 --> 02:01:48.380
<v Speaker 1>you do know what to do when you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know what to do peculiarly enough.</v>

1941
02:01:48.620 --> 02:01:53.620
<v Speaker 1>It's rather nonspecific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's this generalized stress response </v>

1942
02:01:53.620 --> 02:01:56.240
<v Speaker 1>and so what happens is you freeze </v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

1943
02:01:56.241 --> 02:02:00.440
<v Speaker 1>if the threat is enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you produce a lot of cortisol and a</v>

1944
02:02:00.441 --> 02:02:05.441
<v Speaker 1>lot of adrenaline so that you're bloody </v>
<v Speaker 1>well ready to move quick and whatever </v>

1945
02:02:05.441 --> 02:02:09.641
<v Speaker 1>direction you have to and then maybe you</v>
<v Speaker 1>pay more attention and that's what you </v>

1946
02:02:09.641 --> 02:02:14.621
<v Speaker 1>do when you don't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the problem with that is you can </v>

1947
02:02:14.621 --> 02:02:14.621
<v Speaker 1>stay in that state forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

1948
02:02:14.750 --> 02:02:17.000
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of what posttraumatic stress</v>
<v Speaker 1>disorder is.</v>

1949
02:02:17.001 --> 02:02:19.370
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're just like that all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1950
02:02:20.030 --> 02:02:22.910
<v Speaker 1>And the problem with that is it's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable.</v>

1951
02:02:22.911 --> 02:02:27.911
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you stay like that for any length of </v>

1952
02:02:27.911 --> 02:02:27.911
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get depressed,</v>

1953
02:02:27.911 --> 02:02:27.911
<v Speaker 1>you're going to develop an anxiety </v>
<v Speaker 1>disorder,</v>

1954
02:02:27.911 --> 02:02:32.720
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get old because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>burning up resources like mad.</v>

1955
02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:37.720
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your system is shunting everything to </v>

1956
02:02:37.720 --> 02:02:40.850
<v Speaker 1>maintain that state of emergency </v>
<v Speaker 1>preparation and it's exhausting.</v>

1957
02:02:41.060 --> 02:02:46.060
<v Speaker 1>It's not where you want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's partly why people are so prone</v>

1958
02:02:46.851 --> 02:02:51.851
<v Speaker 1>to defend their territories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're familiar territory because if </v>

1959
02:02:51.851 --> 02:02:54.500
<v Speaker 1>they're familiar territory is invaded or</v>
<v Speaker 1>disrupted,</v>

1960
02:02:54.770 --> 02:02:59.770
<v Speaker 1>then they default back to the state of </v>
<v Speaker 1>emergency preparation and that's like </v>

1961
02:02:59.770 --> 02:03:03.110
<v Speaker 1>that can unglue you if it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's profound enough,</v>

1962
02:03:03.260 --> 02:03:04.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you guys know this already.</v>

1963
02:03:04.941 --> 02:03:09.941
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think people experienced this </v>
<v Speaker 1>most particularly when they're betrayed </v>

1964
02:03:09.941 --> 02:03:12.320
<v Speaker 1>by someone they have an intimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with,</v>

1965
02:03:12.350 --> 02:03:13.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're lied to.</v>

1966
02:03:14.060 --> 02:03:17.480
<v Speaker 1>There's other ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the collapse of a dream or a vision that</v>

1967
02:03:17.481 --> 02:03:20.840
<v Speaker 1>you've been pursuing or an illness or </v>
<v Speaker 1>the death in the family.</v>

1968
02:03:20.841 --> 02:03:25.841
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of other ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but be trails is a really good one </v>

1969
02:03:25.841 --> 02:03:26.270
<v Speaker 1>because if you're with someone for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>long time,</v>

1970
02:03:26.271 --> 02:03:27.080
<v Speaker 1>you trust them.</v>

1971
02:03:27.260 --> 02:03:32.260
<v Speaker 1>You have a representation of your past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a representation of you in the </v>

1972
02:03:32.260 --> 02:03:33.560
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a representation of them,</v>

1973
02:03:33.561 --> 02:03:35.900
<v Speaker 1>you have a representation of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of relationships.</v>

1974
02:03:36.080 --> 02:03:39.260
<v Speaker 1>You have a representation of the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get betrayed.</v>

1975
02:03:39.261 --> 02:03:44.261
<v Speaker 1>It's like poof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the past isn't what you thought it </v>

1976
02:03:44.261 --> 02:03:44.261
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1977
02:03:44.261 --> 02:03:45.860
<v Speaker 1>and what about you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1978
02:03:46.250 --> 02:03:50.600
<v Speaker 1>how clueless are you and maybe not at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all or maybe ultimately gullible.</v>

1979
02:03:50.601 --> 02:03:53.490
<v Speaker 1>You don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it your fault or you know,</v>

1980
02:03:53.550 --> 02:03:58.550
<v Speaker 1>are you so clueless that you just can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>protect yourself or was the person </v>

1981
02:03:58.550 --> 02:04:02.171
<v Speaker 1>malevolent in some subtle way that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>failed to detect everything's up in the </v>

1982
02:04:02.171 --> 02:04:03.350
<v Speaker 1>air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not good,</v>

1983
02:04:04.070 --> 02:04:09.070
<v Speaker 1>and this idea that human beings traveled</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the underworld and come back.</v>

1984
02:04:09.111 --> 02:04:14.111
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's a really useful thing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand because we do that all the </v>

1985
02:04:14.111 --> 02:04:15.170
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whenever we fail,</v>

1986
02:04:15.171 --> 02:04:20.171
<v Speaker 1>it's like whip down into the underworld </v>
<v Speaker 1>for awhile where everything's in chaos </v>

1987
02:04:20.171 --> 02:04:22.280
<v Speaker 1>and then maybe we sort ourselves out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>bang,</v>

1988
02:04:22.281 --> 02:04:27.281
<v Speaker 1>we're back up and so one way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualizing yourself is not as order</v>

1989
02:04:28.460 --> 02:04:33.460
<v Speaker 1>and as not as chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as the thing that traverses between </v>

1990
02:04:33.460 --> 02:04:37.220
<v Speaker 1>the two domains and that I would say is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mythological hero.</v>

1991
02:04:43.420 --> 02:04:47.200
<v Speaker 3>So I'm going to start talking to you </v>
<v Speaker 3>about Pinocchio a little bit.</v>

1992
02:04:48.190 --> 02:04:53.190
<v Speaker 3>Weirdly enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope you enjoy this and the reason I </v>

1993
02:04:54.821 --> 02:04:57.070
<v Speaker 3>want to do it is because I want to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to put some.</v>

1994
02:04:59.730 --> 02:05:03.510
<v Speaker 3>I want to bring what I told you </v>
<v Speaker 3>abstractly down to earth,</v>

1995
02:05:03.720 --> 02:05:05.670
<v Speaker 3>and then you can start thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1996
02:05:05.671 --> 02:05:07.680
<v Speaker 3>does the conceptions that I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>introduced to you,</v>

1997
02:05:07.681 --> 02:05:09.420
<v Speaker 3>are they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are they good for anything?</v>

1998
02:05:09.730 --> 02:05:13.980
<v Speaker 3>Did they help?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the order.</v>

1999
02:05:15.600 --> 02:05:19.530
<v Speaker 3>Descend into chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reestablishment of order.</v>

2000
02:05:19.620 --> 02:05:22.590
<v Speaker 3>That's paradise lost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Profane history,</v>

2001
02:05:22.710 --> 02:05:27.710
<v Speaker 3>paradise regained.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the classic comedy and that's the </v>

2002
02:05:27.710 --> 02:05:31.230
<v Speaker 3>story of life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the question is how do you manage</v>

2003
02:05:31.231 --> 02:05:35.380
<v Speaker 3>it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's a question you really want</v>

2004
02:05:35.381 --> 02:05:37.440
<v Speaker 3>to know the answer to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you'll go,</v>

2005
02:05:37.530 --> 02:05:42.530
<v Speaker 3>you'll pay money weirdly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll line up and pay money to see a </v>

2006
02:05:42.530 --> 02:05:45.420
<v Speaker 3>story about that even if you don't even </v>
<v Speaker 3>know that that's what the story's about.</v>

2007
02:05:45.780 --> 02:05:50.780
<v Speaker 3>And the reason for that is that actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of you does know what the story's </v>

2008
02:05:50.780 --> 02:05:50.780
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2009
02:05:50.780 --> 02:05:53.100
<v Speaker 3>you have your cognition has multiple </v>
<v Speaker 3>layers.</v>

2010
02:05:53.430 --> 02:05:57.550
<v Speaker 3>You understand things that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

2011
02:05:57.551 --> 02:06:01.000
<v Speaker 3>you understand in ways that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand.</v>

2012
02:06:01.060 --> 02:06:02.620
<v Speaker 3>And you can tell that because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2013
02:06:02.621 --> 02:06:04.450
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we talked about Pinocchio a little bit,</v>

2014
02:06:04.720 --> 02:06:07.780
<v Speaker 3>how absurd it is and that it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>matter.</v>

2015
02:06:08.020 --> 02:06:08.420
<v Speaker 3>Well</v>

2016
02:06:10.670 --> 02:06:13.000
<v Speaker 2>question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we've been talking.</v>

2017
02:06:13.170 --> 02:06:18.170
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he also is when people don't do what </v>

2018
02:06:18.170 --> 02:06:18.170
<v Speaker 2>they expect you to do it in the negative</v>
<v Speaker 2>sense,</v>

2019
02:06:18.230 --> 02:06:23.230
<v Speaker 2>something bad happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if the reaction is extremely </v>

2020
02:06:23.230 --> 02:06:26.731
<v Speaker 2>positive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like something that you don't like </v>

2021
02:06:26.731 --> 02:06:26.731
<v Speaker 2>winning a lottery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that,</v>

2022
02:06:26.731 --> 02:06:28.030
<v Speaker 2>do you also go into the stress response?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

2023
02:06:29.740 --> 02:06:31.770
<v Speaker 2>So it'd be the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2024
02:06:31.771 --> 02:06:31.920
<v Speaker 2>it's</v>

2025
02:06:31.920 --> 02:06:33.720
<v Speaker 3>not quite the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a good question.</v>

2026
02:06:33.721 --> 02:06:36.420
<v Speaker 3>And we will address that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We will address that.</v>

2027
02:06:36.970 --> 02:06:40.230
<v Speaker 3>I mean winning the lottery is generally </v>
<v Speaker 3>not a good idea for people,</v>

2028
02:06:41.550 --> 02:06:43.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's just too much.</v>

2029
02:06:43.890 --> 02:06:47.820
<v Speaker 3>It's too much for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Flips their lives upside down so.</v>

2030
02:06:48.410 --> 02:06:53.410
<v Speaker 3>And they tend to at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at best to return to their original </v>

2031
02:06:53.410 --> 02:06:53.510
<v Speaker 3>baseline level of emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

2032
02:06:53.511 --> 02:06:58.511
<v Speaker 3>something remarkably good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's a lot better than something </v>

2033
02:06:58.531 --> 02:07:03.150
<v Speaker 3>remarkably bad obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it still can have that destabilizing</v>

2034
02:07:03.390 --> 02:07:08.390
<v Speaker 3>effect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it depends on what elements of your </v>

2035
02:07:08.390 --> 02:07:09.960
<v Speaker 3>life it disrupts it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's some,</v>

2036
02:07:10.080 --> 02:07:15.080
<v Speaker 3>some in some sense you have a map that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're operating within in the world and</v>

2037
02:07:16.141 --> 02:07:19.230
<v Speaker 3>that map is predicated on assumptions of</v>
<v Speaker 3>different sorts.</v>

2038
02:07:19.500 --> 02:07:24.500
<v Speaker 3>Some shallow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some profound when the profound </v>

2039
02:07:24.500 --> 02:07:27.861
<v Speaker 3>assumptions are devastated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huge chunks of the map or invalidated </v>

2040
02:07:27.861 --> 02:07:32.600
<v Speaker 3>and that can happen sometimes when </v>
<v Speaker 3>dramatically positive things happen as </v>

2041
02:07:32.600 --> 02:07:32.760
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

2042
02:07:33.360 --> 02:07:38.360
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the fundamental rule is the more of </v>

2043
02:07:38.360 --> 02:07:42.031
<v Speaker 3>your axiomatic presuppositions are </v>
<v Speaker 3>disrupted,</v>

2044
02:07:43.390 --> 02:07:45.370
<v Speaker 3>the harder it is on you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2045
02:07:45.371 --> 02:07:47.320
<v Speaker 3>like maybe you quit your job because you</v>
<v Speaker 3>win the lottery.</v>

2046
02:07:47.530 --> 02:07:47.950
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

2047
02:07:47.951 --> 02:07:50.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm off to the beach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to drink Margaritas.</v>

2048
02:07:50.490 --> 02:07:53.080
<v Speaker 3>So that'll work for about four days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2049
02:07:53.081 --> 02:07:54.450
<v Speaker 3>you do that for three months,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a,</v>

2050
02:07:54.570 --> 02:07:57.760
<v Speaker 3>you're a beach alcoholic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like that's a real improvement,</v>

2051
02:07:58.090 --> 02:07:59.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's not that easy.</v>

2052
02:07:59.531 --> 02:08:02.500
<v Speaker 3>And often too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you take people out of their routine,</v>

2053
02:08:03.710 --> 02:08:05.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just flounder.</v>

2054
02:08:06.640 --> 02:08:09.250
<v Speaker 3>Their circadian rhythms go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't eat properly,</v>

2055
02:08:09.310 --> 02:08:11.440
<v Speaker 3>they don't know what the hell to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

2056
02:08:11.530 --> 02:08:16.090
<v Speaker 3>So this is often why people have such a </v>
<v Speaker 3>hard time when they retire.</v>

2057
02:08:16.930 --> 02:08:21.930
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to retire and relax.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like fire relaxed for two weeks I </v>

2058
02:08:23.821 --> 02:08:25.350
<v Speaker 3>would die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2059
02:08:25.590 --> 02:08:28.980
<v Speaker 3>I need something to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to be engaged in something.</v>

2060
02:08:29.460 --> 02:08:30.220
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2061
02:08:32.340 --> 02:08:37.340
<v Speaker 3>Pinocchio,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Disney movie and early one a </v>

2062
02:08:37.340 --> 02:08:40.761
<v Speaker 3>masterpiece.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I'm going to walk you through it </v>

2063
02:08:40.761 --> 02:08:43.850
<v Speaker 3>and I'm going to tell you what I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>it means and you can tell me if you </v>

2064
02:08:44.191 --> 02:08:49.191
<v Speaker 3>think that that's useful and I'm only </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to do that for about 10 minutes </v>

2065
02:08:49.191 --> 02:08:50.070
<v Speaker 3>today because I do want to cover some of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the details of the class.</v>

2066
02:08:50.071 --> 02:08:53.340
<v Speaker 3>And then next class we'll continue with </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

2067
02:08:53.820 --> 02:08:54.210
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2068
02:08:56.640 --> 02:09:01.640
<v Speaker 3>so the movie opens with the opening </v>
<v Speaker 3>credits which are carved wooden signs,</v>

2069
02:09:03.060 --> 02:09:04.290
<v Speaker 3>which is like a hint,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2070
02:09:04.291 --> 02:09:09.291
<v Speaker 3>because Japan was a carver and it starts</v>
<v Speaker 3>with this song which was actually quite </v>

2071
02:09:09.291 --> 02:09:13.830
<v Speaker 3>a popular song and it's a bit of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would you call it,</v>

2072
02:09:15.270 --> 02:09:18.810
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the poetry is particularly profound,</v>

2073
02:09:19.860 --> 02:09:22.650
<v Speaker 3>but it was a song that people liked and </v>
<v Speaker 3>people still listen to.</v>

2074
02:09:22.651 --> 02:09:26.220
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it sets the tone for the movie,</v>

2075
02:09:26.310 --> 02:09:31.310
<v Speaker 3>which is what music does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that's really </v>

2076
02:09:31.310 --> 02:09:31.650
<v Speaker 3>interesting about movies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really mysterious is that,</v>

2077
02:09:32.190 --> 02:09:34.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you go to a movie,</v>

2078
02:09:34.561 --> 02:09:37.260
<v Speaker 3>there's almost always a soundtrack,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2079
02:09:37.261 --> 02:09:39.320
<v Speaker 3>If you go to a movie and the reason to </v>
<v Speaker 3>soundtrack it,</v>

2080
02:09:39.460 --> 02:09:44.460
<v Speaker 3>it kind of feels empty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It feels like there's something missing </v>

2081
02:09:44.460 --> 02:09:44.460
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's as if the music,</v>

2082
02:09:44.460 --> 02:09:45.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you go to a movie,</v>

2083
02:09:45.181 --> 02:09:47.070
<v Speaker 3>there's lots of things you can't see.</v>

2084
02:09:47.070 --> 02:09:52.070
<v Speaker 3>The characters are only partial and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know anything about their </v>

2085
02:09:52.070 --> 02:09:52.550
<v Speaker 3>background.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like a low resolution thing.</v>

2086
02:09:52.770 --> 02:09:57.770
<v Speaker 3>What seems to happen with the music is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it provides the emotional </v>

2087
02:09:57.770 --> 02:09:59.040
<v Speaker 3>background,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the complex context,</v>

2088
02:09:59.041 --> 02:10:02.850
<v Speaker 3>let's say it's like a substitute for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>context and it,</v>

2089
02:10:03.090 --> 02:10:04.770
<v Speaker 3>it guides you in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in your,</v>

2090
02:10:04.950 --> 02:10:07.980
<v Speaker 3>in your perceptions of the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gives you hints about what's going to</v>

2091
02:10:07.981 --> 02:10:08.600
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2092
02:10:09.050 --> 02:10:11.060
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the funny thing about that is,</v>

2093
02:10:11.061 --> 02:10:16.061
<v Speaker 3>is that we just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we just don't have any problem with </v>

2094
02:10:16.061 --> 02:10:16.061
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2095
02:10:16.061 --> 02:10:16.061
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2096
02:10:16.061 --> 02:10:20.331
<v Speaker 3>of course movie has its own track and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and of course when there's a dramatic </v>

2097
02:10:20.331 --> 02:10:22.830
<v Speaker 3>scene and the music gets dramatic and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't happen in real life.</v>

2098
02:10:22.890 --> 02:10:25.680
<v Speaker 3>So you'd wonder why we would accept it </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a movie.</v>

2099
02:10:25.681 --> 02:10:30.681
<v Speaker 3>And I think it's partly because we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>willing to accept the amplification of </v>

2100
02:10:30.681 --> 02:10:34.070
<v Speaker 3>reality that constitutes a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in fact,</v>

2101
02:10:34.071 --> 02:10:39.071
<v Speaker 3>we find that compelling and music is one</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the things that does that </v>

2102
02:10:39.071 --> 02:10:39.140
<v Speaker 3>amplification,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dramatization,</v>

2103
02:10:39.410 --> 02:10:41.330
<v Speaker 3>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's acceptable to us.</v>

2104
02:10:42.470 --> 02:10:47.470
<v Speaker 3>This song I find quite interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm going to take it apart quite a </v>

2105
02:10:47.470 --> 02:10:47.470
<v Speaker 3>bit.</v>

2106
02:10:47.470 --> 02:10:47.470
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2107
02:10:50.550 --> 02:10:53.040
<v Speaker 3>in some sense I feel foolish doing it </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's,</v>

2108
02:10:53.370 --> 02:10:53.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

2109
02:10:54.030 --> 02:10:58.020
<v Speaker 3>it's a childish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>childish song in some ways.</v>

2110
02:10:58.800 --> 02:11:01.320
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's okay.</v>

2111
02:11:01.800 --> 02:11:05.160
<v Speaker 3>When you wish upon a star,</v>
<v Speaker 3>makes no difference who you are.</v>

2112
02:11:06.090 --> 02:11:07.350
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2113
02:11:07.590 --> 02:11:12.590
<v Speaker 3>there's some mysteries there people wish</v>
<v Speaker 3>upon stars.</v>

2114
02:11:13.621 --> 02:11:14.980
<v Speaker 3>That's like a little ritual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2115
02:11:17.070 --> 02:11:19.740
<v Speaker 3>Why do they do that?</v>

2116
02:11:22.500 --> 02:11:22.920
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2117
02:11:25.810 --> 02:11:30.810
<v Speaker 3>and what exactly is the star?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's another question because there </v>

2118
02:11:31.181 --> 02:11:35.110
<v Speaker 3>are stars that shine in the heavens and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there are people who are stars.</v>

2119
02:11:36.790 --> 02:11:37.360
<v Speaker 2>And so</v>

2120
02:11:39.190 --> 02:11:42.970
<v Speaker 3>why are people stars?</v>
<v Speaker 3>While they're usually famous people,</v>

2121
02:11:42.971 --> 02:11:47.971
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are people that who attract a lot </v>

2122
02:11:47.971 --> 02:11:50.251
<v Speaker 3>of attention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And maybe there are people who have a </v>

2123
02:11:50.251 --> 02:11:50.251
<v Speaker 3>lot of talent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's another possibility.</v>

2124
02:11:50.270 --> 02:11:52.090
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe their models,</v>

2125
02:11:52.390 --> 02:11:53.950
<v Speaker 3>I don't mean you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>clothing models,</v>

2126
02:11:53.960 --> 02:11:56.890
<v Speaker 3>although sometimes they are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there are models for emulation.</v>

2127
02:11:57.340 --> 02:12:02.340
<v Speaker 3>That's what being a star means.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why people magazine is full of </v>

2128
02:12:02.340 --> 02:12:02.340
<v Speaker 3>stars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like they're,</v>

2129
02:12:02.340 --> 02:12:05.260
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like heroes brought to earth and</v>

2130
02:12:05.261 --> 02:12:09.820
<v Speaker 3>of course you know nothing about them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All you know is their public persona and</v>

2131
02:12:09.821 --> 02:12:14.821
<v Speaker 3>of course they're usually very </v>
<v Speaker 3>attractive and so that allows you to </v>

2132
02:12:14.821 --> 02:12:18.331
<v Speaker 3>project upon them all of the things that</v>
<v Speaker 3>would go along with ideal humanity and </v>

2133
02:12:19.181 --> 02:12:24.181
<v Speaker 3>so their stars and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but still why stars will stars Beckman </v>

2134
02:12:24.271 --> 02:12:25.690
<v Speaker 3>in the darkness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2135
02:12:26.080 --> 02:12:29.290
<v Speaker 3>And their other worldly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing.</v>

2136
02:12:29.291 --> 02:12:34.291
<v Speaker 3>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not of this earth and I mean </v>

2137
02:12:34.291 --> 02:12:36.760
<v Speaker 3>that technically because obviously </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not of this earth,</v>

2138
02:12:36.761 --> 02:12:37.600
<v Speaker 3>but I also mean it.</v>

2139
02:12:38.080 --> 02:12:42.610
<v Speaker 3>I mean it phenomenologically I mean it </v>
<v Speaker 3>as an element of human experience.</v>

2140
02:12:42.611 --> 02:12:47.611
<v Speaker 3>So most of you are urban and so you've </v>
<v Speaker 3>not had the experience of perhaps of the</v>

2141
02:12:50.411 --> 02:12:52.090
<v Speaker 3>full night sky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2142
02:12:52.091 --> 02:12:57.091
<v Speaker 3>and that's really too bad because the </v>
<v Speaker 3>full night sky is one of those </v>

2143
02:12:57.091 --> 02:12:59.890
<v Speaker 3>experiences that actually induces all </v>
<v Speaker 3>naturally,</v>

2144
02:12:59.950 --> 02:13:04.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and no wonder you look up there and </v>

2145
02:13:04.950 --> 02:13:04.950
<v Speaker 3>there's just stars everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2146
02:13:04.950 --> 02:13:06.760
<v Speaker 3>You're looking at the edge of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>galaxy.</v>

2147
02:13:06.761 --> 02:13:08.530
<v Speaker 3>That's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the Milky Way,</v>

2148
02:13:08.531 --> 02:13:09.880
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the edge of the galaxy.</v>

2149
02:13:09.881 --> 02:13:11.560
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

2150
02:13:11.680 --> 02:13:16.680
<v Speaker 3>there's the edge of the galaxy and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's just so many of them and it's </v>

2151
02:13:16.680 --> 02:13:18.400
<v Speaker 3>such an expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're looking into infinity,</v>

2152
02:13:18.610 --> 02:13:22.150
<v Speaker 3>you're looking into the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're looking beyond yourself,</v>

2153
02:13:22.390 --> 02:13:24.370
<v Speaker 3>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2154
02:13:24.371 --> 02:13:29.371
<v Speaker 3>that produces a sense of awe in people </v>
<v Speaker 3>like looking at the Grand Canyon or </v>

2155
02:13:29.371 --> 02:13:29.760
<v Speaker 3>something like that and it's.</v>

2156
02:13:29.850 --> 02:13:32.010
<v Speaker 3>You're looking at something that </v>
<v Speaker 3>transcends yourself,</v>

2157
02:13:32.011 --> 02:13:34.470
<v Speaker 3>but that feeling of awe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that seems to be something that's,</v>

2158
02:13:35.350 --> 02:13:38.400
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a natural part of our response.</v>

2159
02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:44.000
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might feel or when you meet someone </v>

2160
02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.521
<v Speaker 3>that you regard as particularly </v>
<v Speaker 3>admirable as well because you'll feel </v>

2161
02:13:46.521 --> 02:13:46.650
<v Speaker 3>that there's something transcendent </v>
<v Speaker 3>about them.</v>

2162
02:13:46.651 --> 02:13:49.050
<v Speaker 3>So here's an interesting thing to think </v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

2163
02:13:50.910 --> 02:13:55.910
<v Speaker 3>There are people you admire and there </v>
<v Speaker 3>are people that you don't admire and </v>

2164
02:13:56.251 --> 02:13:57.180
<v Speaker 3>that's a clue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2165
02:13:57.181 --> 02:14:01.170
<v Speaker 3>That's a clue as to your value system </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it might be not really something you</v>

2166
02:14:01.171 --> 02:14:06.171
<v Speaker 3>can even put your finger on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like if you find this person </v>

2167
02:14:06.171 --> 02:14:06.930
<v Speaker 3>captivating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you find this person at my admirable and</v>

2168
02:14:06.931 --> 02:14:11.931
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's as if there's something inside of </v>

2169
02:14:11.931 --> 02:14:11.931
<v Speaker 3>you that's looking for what's admirable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2170
02:14:11.931 --> 02:14:14.210
<v Speaker 3>assuming that you are and that person </v>
<v Speaker 3>who's admirable has a,</v>

2171
02:14:14.430 --> 02:14:17.910
<v Speaker 3>has a faculty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some faculty that you would like to have</v>

2172
02:14:17.911 --> 02:14:18.810
<v Speaker 3>for yourself.</v>

2173
02:14:18.990 --> 02:14:23.990
<v Speaker 3>And so there are a model for emulation </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's part of helping people </v>

2174
02:14:23.990 --> 02:14:23.990
<v Speaker 3>develop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2175
02:14:23.990 --> 02:14:27.990
<v Speaker 3>like little kids often develop little </v>
<v Speaker 3>hero crushes on older kids,</v>

2176
02:14:28.310 --> 02:14:29.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not that much older,</v>

2177
02:14:29.431 --> 02:14:34.431
<v Speaker 3>but sort of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the person that's sort of just within </v>

2178
02:14:34.431 --> 02:14:35.490
<v Speaker 3>their grasp and then they follow them </v>
<v Speaker 3>around and imitate them and you know,</v>

2179
02:14:35.640 --> 02:14:37.770
<v Speaker 3>so they're imitating what they find </v>
<v Speaker 3>admirable.</v>

2180
02:14:38.340 --> 02:14:43.340
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact that you find something </v>

2181
02:14:43.340 --> 02:14:45.921
<v Speaker 3>admirable as a hint,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as to the structure of your unconscious </v>

2182
02:14:45.921 --> 02:14:49.401
<v Speaker 3>value system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you could think even as an </v>

2183
02:14:49.401 --> 02:14:53.541
<v Speaker 3>exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could take well what qualities of a </v>

2184
02:14:53.541 --> 02:14:56.690
<v Speaker 3>human being do I find admirable?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to ask yourself that in a </v>

2185
02:14:56.690 --> 02:14:57.090
<v Speaker 3>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't really think about it.</v>

2186
02:14:57.300 --> 02:15:02.300
<v Speaker 3>There is a difference between asking </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself a question and thinking about </v>

2187
02:15:02.300 --> 02:15:02.300
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2188
02:15:02.300 --> 02:15:04.980
<v Speaker 3>because it's more like when you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>asking yourself a question,</v>

2189
02:15:04.981 --> 02:15:06.480
<v Speaker 3>it's contemplating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

2190
02:15:06.810 --> 02:15:08.550
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do I find admirable?</v>

2191
02:15:09.120 --> 02:15:12.870
<v Speaker 3>It's question you don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you're fortunate and this happens</v>

2192
02:15:12.871 --> 02:15:17.871
<v Speaker 3>quite regularly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an answer will float up from wherever </v>

2193
02:15:17.871 --> 02:15:18.790
<v Speaker 3>the hell answers float up and oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's one,</v>

2194
02:15:18.791 --> 02:15:23.400
<v Speaker 3>and you can write that down and you get </v>
<v Speaker 3>some idea of what your ideal is,</v>

2195
02:15:23.430 --> 02:15:28.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you have one likely and what your </v>

2196
02:15:28.430 --> 02:15:30.921
<v Speaker 3>counter ideal is star well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to wish upon a star is to raise your </v>

2197
02:15:34.831 --> 02:15:39.831
<v Speaker 3>eyes above the horizon and to focus on </v>
<v Speaker 3>something transcendent that's beyond </v>

2198
02:15:39.831 --> 02:15:41.940
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To focus on the absolute we could say to</v>

2199
02:15:41.941 --> 02:15:44.220
<v Speaker 3>focus on the light that shines in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>darkness.</v>

2200
02:15:44.780 --> 02:15:49.780
<v Speaker 3>Now a stars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people wear diamonds because they're </v>

2201
02:15:49.780 --> 02:15:53.661
<v Speaker 3>like stars or they're like the sun and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're pure and perfect and the </v>

2202
02:15:53.661 --> 02:15:54.720
<v Speaker 3>glitter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so there's something about the light</v>

2203
02:15:54.721 --> 02:15:59.721
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's something about a source of </v>

2204
02:15:59.721 --> 02:16:01.551
<v Speaker 3>light.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a source of illumination and </v>

2205
02:16:01.551 --> 02:16:03.981
<v Speaker 3>enlightenment and the and the light that</v>
<v Speaker 3>shines in the darkness is a deep </v>

2206
02:16:03.981 --> 02:16:03.981
<v Speaker 3>metaphor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2207
02:16:03.981 --> 02:16:04.260
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2208
02:16:04.590 --> 02:16:05.880
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's what you want,</v>

2209
02:16:05.881 --> 02:16:10.881
<v Speaker 3>you want a light to shine in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>darkness and so the star has all that </v>

2210
02:16:10.881 --> 02:16:14.811
<v Speaker 3>and so people wish upon a star because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they have some intuition that aiming </v>

2211
02:16:15.210 --> 02:16:20.130
<v Speaker 3>above the mundane has the potential to </v>
<v Speaker 3>transform themselves.</v>

2212
02:16:20.131 --> 02:16:21.870
<v Speaker 3>They make a wish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2213
02:16:23.130 --> 02:16:28.130
<v Speaker 3>if you're gonna make a wish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should aim at something high and </v>

2214
02:16:28.990 --> 02:16:30.010
<v Speaker 3>even just aiming</v>

2215
02:16:30.010 --> 02:16:32.530
<v Speaker 1>at that is more likely to make the wish </v>
<v Speaker 1>come true.</v>

2216
02:16:32.531 --> 02:16:36.400
<v Speaker 1>And this is not a metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2217
02:16:36.480 --> 02:16:41.480
<v Speaker 1>I have this program which you guys are </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to do called the future authoring </v>

2218
02:16:41.480 --> 02:16:44.770
<v Speaker 1>program is one of two assignments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is that you write an autobiography,</v>

2219
02:16:44.920 --> 02:16:49.920
<v Speaker 1>that's the past authoring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other is that you write a plan for </v>

2220
02:16:49.920 --> 02:16:49.920
<v Speaker 1>the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the future authoring.</v>

2221
02:16:49.920 --> 02:16:52.300
<v Speaker 1>I would recommend that you get started </v>
<v Speaker 1>on those right now,</v>

2222
02:16:52.410 --> 02:16:57.410
<v Speaker 1>like not right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like really soon because they're </v>

2223
02:16:57.410 --> 02:16:59.740
<v Speaker 1>harder than you think and some of you </v>
<v Speaker 1>are gonna write like 15,000</v>

2224
02:16:59.741 --> 02:17:02.530
<v Speaker 1>words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get sucked right in.</v>

2225
02:17:02.560 --> 02:17:05.260
<v Speaker 1>This happens all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get sucked right into it</v>

2226
02:17:05.860 --> 02:17:10.860
<v Speaker 1>and so you write an autobiography </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you need to know where you are </v>

2227
02:17:10.860 --> 02:17:14.050
<v Speaker 1>and who you are right now because how </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hell are you going to plot a pathway</v>

2228
02:17:14.051 --> 02:17:17.740
<v Speaker 1>to the future unless you know where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>are and then you need to write about the</v>

2229
02:17:17.741 --> 02:17:20.830
<v Speaker 1>future because you weren't going to hit </v>
<v Speaker 1>something unless he aim at it.</v>

2230
02:17:22.550 --> 02:17:27.550
<v Speaker 1>That's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And lots of times people won't aim at </v>

2231
02:17:27.550 --> 02:17:30.821
<v Speaker 1>what they want because they're afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason they're afraid is because if </v>

2232
02:17:30.821 --> 02:17:34.271
<v Speaker 1>you specify what you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've specified your conditions of </v>

2233
02:17:34.271 --> 02:17:37.391
<v Speaker 1>failure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know when you fail and it's better </v>

2234
02:17:37.391 --> 02:17:37.391
<v Speaker 1>just to keep it foggy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2235
02:17:37.391 --> 02:17:42.311
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I'm succeeding or </v>

2236
02:17:42.311 --> 02:17:42.311
<v Speaker 1>failing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

2237
02:17:42.311 --> 02:17:42.311
<v Speaker 1>I can't really tell while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great,</v>

2238
02:17:42.620 --> 02:17:45.320
<v Speaker 1>except you can't hit anything you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>aim at.</v>

2239
02:17:45.590 --> 02:17:48.980
<v Speaker 1>And so the future authoring program is </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a.</v>

2240
02:17:49.550 --> 02:17:54.550
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an attempt to have you articulate your </v>

2241
02:17:54.550 --> 02:17:54.560
<v Speaker 1>character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so as the past authoring program,</v>

2242
02:17:54.920 --> 02:17:59.920
<v Speaker 1>who are you and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pastor authoring program and asked </v>

2243
02:18:00.171 --> 02:18:04.550
<v Speaker 1>you to break your life into the parks </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then to write about the emotional,</v>

2244
02:18:05.030 --> 02:18:06.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that you regard as important.</v>

2245
02:18:08.270 --> 02:18:08.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2246
02:18:08.970 --> 02:18:11.990
<v Speaker 1>Important events that have shaped who </v>
<v Speaker 1>you are and you know,</v>

2247
02:18:11.991 --> 02:18:16.991
<v Speaker 1>you may find that some of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of that writing makes you </v>

2248
02:18:16.991 --> 02:18:19.281
<v Speaker 1>emotional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say if you have a memory that's </v>

2249
02:18:19.281 --> 02:18:19.830
<v Speaker 1>more than 18 months old roughly </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking,</v>

2250
02:18:19.831 --> 02:18:23.460
<v Speaker 1>and when you bring it to mind it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has an emotional impact,</v>

2251
02:18:23.461 --> 02:18:25.670
<v Speaker 1>especially a negative emotional impact </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2252
02:18:25.690 --> 02:18:28.440
<v Speaker 1>It's like part of your soul is stuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>back there.</v>

2253
02:18:29.240 --> 02:18:32.130
<v Speaker 1>And I know that's a metaphorical way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about it.</v>

2254
02:18:32.131 --> 02:18:33.390
<v Speaker 1>But what I mean is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2255
02:18:35.010 --> 02:18:40.010
<v Speaker 1>the reason that you still experience the</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion is because you have not solved </v>

2256
02:18:40.010 --> 02:18:44.010
<v Speaker 1>the problem that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that situation faced you with.</v>

2257
02:18:44.011 --> 02:18:49.011
<v Speaker 1>It might be a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe you got tangled up with </v>

2258
02:18:49.011 --> 02:18:49.011
<v Speaker 1>someone who was really bad and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>rough man,</v>

2259
02:18:49.011 --> 02:18:53.871
<v Speaker 1>because you've got to come up with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>theory of malevolence to deal with </v>

2260
02:18:53.871 --> 02:18:53.871
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's no joke.</v>

2261
02:18:53.871 --> 02:18:58.670
<v Speaker 1>But if it still produces emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means you haven't solved the problem </v>

2262
02:18:58.670 --> 02:19:03.380
<v Speaker 1>and and your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain is still pegging it as </v>

2263
02:19:03.380 --> 02:19:03.380
<v Speaker 1>threat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2264
02:19:03.380 --> 02:19:05.430
<v Speaker 1>it's a part of your territory that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>did not master threat,</v>

2265
02:19:05.431 --> 02:19:05.970
<v Speaker 1>threat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>threat,</v>

2266
02:19:05.971 --> 02:19:06.600
<v Speaker 1>threat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>threat,</v>

2267
02:19:07.260 --> 02:19:10.230
<v Speaker 1>and until you take it apart and </v>
<v Speaker 1>articulation really helps,</v>

2268
02:19:10.231 --> 02:19:15.231
<v Speaker 1>that writing really helps that then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to free yourself from </v>

2269
02:19:15.231 --> 02:19:17.670
<v Speaker 1>its grip and that might not be that </v>
<v Speaker 1>pleasant.</v>

2270
02:19:17.671 --> 02:19:20.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is one of those situations </v>
<v Speaker 1>were doing.</v>

2271
02:19:20.461 --> 02:19:25.050
<v Speaker 1>It tends to produce a decrement in </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's mood in the short term,</v>

2272
02:19:25.051 --> 02:19:28.190
<v Speaker 1>but quite radical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three to six months</v>

2273
02:19:28.190 --> 02:19:29.680
<v Speaker 3>down the road,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2274
02:19:29.690 --> 02:19:34.690
<v Speaker 3>and it's often the case that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>unfortunately have to do something you </v>

2275
02:19:34.690 --> 02:19:35.870
<v Speaker 3>don't want to do in order to progress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very,</v>

2276
02:19:36.230 --> 02:19:41.230
<v Speaker 3>very common.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in the future authoring program asks </v>

2277
02:19:41.230 --> 02:19:42.410
<v Speaker 3>you about different dimensions of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>

2278
02:19:43.470 --> 02:19:45.380
<v Speaker 3>like because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2279
02:19:45.381 --> 02:19:47.870
<v Speaker 3>you can take yourself as a personality </v>
<v Speaker 3>inside your head,</v>

2280
02:19:47.871 --> 02:19:52.871
<v Speaker 3>but your nested in systems that </v>
<v Speaker 3>transcend you and they're just as real </v>

2281
02:19:52.871 --> 02:19:54.530
<v Speaker 3>as whatever's in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2282
02:19:54.860 --> 02:19:57.890
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you need for life?</v>

2283
02:19:58.100 --> 02:20:00.200
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's pretty easy actually.</v>

2284
02:20:01.100 --> 02:20:03.380
<v Speaker 3>Some friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a good thing,</v>

2285
02:20:03.950 --> 02:20:06.260
<v Speaker 3>intimate relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a good thing.</v>

2286
02:20:07.070 --> 02:20:12.070
<v Speaker 3>Family,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know either the one you're going to </v>

2287
02:20:12.070 --> 02:20:14.921
<v Speaker 3>produce or the one that you come from </v>
<v Speaker 3>where people to some degree of love and </v>

2288
02:20:14.921 --> 02:20:16.790
<v Speaker 3>care for one another.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good thing to work on.</v>

2289
02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:19.640
<v Speaker 3>You need,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need some plan for your career.</v>

2290
02:20:19.641 --> 02:20:24.641
<v Speaker 3>You've got to fit in somewhere that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people regard as important and that </v>

2291
02:20:24.641 --> 02:20:26.390
<v Speaker 3>they'll trade with you so that you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>live.</v>

2292
02:20:26.690 --> 02:20:31.460
<v Speaker 3>You need something worthwhile to do with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the time that you're not at work and you</v>

2293
02:20:31.461 --> 02:20:36.170
<v Speaker 3>need to pay attention to your mental and</v>
<v Speaker 3>physical health and you need to regulate</v>

2294
02:20:36.171 --> 02:20:39.200
<v Speaker 3>your use of substances,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a strange one,</v>

2295
02:20:39.201 --> 02:20:41.570
<v Speaker 3>but alcohol does lots of people in so </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's worth.</v>

2296
02:20:41.810 --> 02:20:43.760
<v Speaker 3>It's worth thinking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why we put it in there,</v>

2297
02:20:43.880 --> 02:20:44.810
<v Speaker 3>so then it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2298
02:20:44.811 --> 02:20:47.960
<v Speaker 3>what the hell do you want?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you want from your friends?</v>

2299
02:20:48.230 --> 02:20:50.990
<v Speaker 3>What do you want from your family?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or do you want from your career?</v>

2300
02:20:51.200 --> 02:20:53.660
<v Speaker 3>If you could have what you want and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what the program asks you.</v>

2301
02:20:53.661 --> 02:20:57.080
<v Speaker 3>Three to five years down the road,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get to have what you want.</v>

2302
02:20:58.370 --> 02:21:00.770
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm assuming that you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>approach this like,</v>

2303
02:21:01.280 --> 02:21:06.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reasonable adults and not like 13 year </v>

2304
02:21:06.280 --> 02:21:09.431
<v Speaker 3>old dreamers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I want the most expensive yacht </v>

2305
02:21:09.431 --> 02:21:09.431
<v Speaker 3>in the world.</v>

2306
02:21:09.470 --> 02:21:11.150
<v Speaker 3>It's like fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

2307
02:21:12.440 --> 02:21:17.440
<v Speaker 3>that isn't really what it's supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be more concentrating on your character </v>

2308
02:21:17.770 --> 02:21:22.770
<v Speaker 3>and so then it asks you to write for 15 </v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes without thinking too much about </v>

2309
02:21:22.770 --> 02:21:26.180
<v Speaker 3>grammar or sentence structure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Any of that,</v>

2310
02:21:27.590 --> 02:21:32.590
<v Speaker 3>but what your life could be like three </v>
<v Speaker 3>to five years down the road if you were </v>

2311
02:21:32.590 --> 02:21:36.131
<v Speaker 3>treating yourself like someone you cared</v>
<v Speaker 3>for and you were helping them figure out</v>

2312
02:21:36.441 --> 02:21:40.910
<v Speaker 3>what they wanted and then it asks you to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do the same thing in reverse,</v>

2313
02:21:41.300 --> 02:21:46.300
<v Speaker 3>which is to think about the ways that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're radically insufficient and your </v>

2314
02:21:48.051 --> 02:21:50.750
<v Speaker 3>faults and everyone knows this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

2315
02:21:50.751 --> 02:21:51.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe not,</v>

2316
02:21:52.670 --> 02:21:56.240
<v Speaker 3>but everyone has a sense of if they were</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to degenerate,</v>

2317
02:21:56.330 --> 02:21:57.920
<v Speaker 3>how they would do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2318
02:21:57.921 --> 02:22:00.680
<v Speaker 3>some people would be an alcoholic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people would be a street person.</v>

2319
02:22:00.681 --> 02:22:05.681
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's some doom thing out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there that's got your name on it if </v>

2320
02:22:05.681 --> 02:22:08.090
<v Speaker 3>you're particularly in cautious and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

2321
02:22:08.300 --> 02:22:11.960
<v Speaker 3>don't and let things fall apart.</v>

2322
02:22:12.050 --> 02:22:16.730
<v Speaker 3>So I want you to write about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you not want to have happened in</v>

2323
02:22:16.731 --> 02:22:21.731
<v Speaker 3>three to five years?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's psychological reasons for </v>

2324
02:22:21.731 --> 02:22:24.671
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A one is you have something to aim for </v>

2325
02:22:24.671 --> 02:22:28.301
<v Speaker 3>that's a source of positive emotion </v>
<v Speaker 3>because your positive emotion is mostly </v>

2326
02:22:28.301 --> 02:22:31.050
<v Speaker 3>generated by evidence that you're moving</v>
<v Speaker 3>towards something that you value.</v>

2327
02:22:31.500 --> 02:22:34.950
<v Speaker 3>It's not generated so much by </v>
<v Speaker 3>accomplishing something because when you</v>

2328
02:22:34.951 --> 02:22:39.951
<v Speaker 3>accomplished something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just left with the problem of </v>

2329
02:22:39.951 --> 02:22:39.951
<v Speaker 3>whatever you're going to do next.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you graduate from university.</v>

2330
02:22:39.951 --> 02:22:41.240
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2331
02:22:41.400 --> 02:22:46.400
<v Speaker 3>Hooray.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One day you're at the peak of your </v>

2332
02:22:46.400 --> 02:22:49.941
<v Speaker 3>undergraduate university career.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The next day you're unemployed and </v>

2333
02:22:49.941 --> 02:22:52.200
<v Speaker 3>looking for a bad job at starbucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2334
02:22:52.201 --> 02:22:54.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>while you see what I mean is,</v>

2335
02:22:54.621 --> 02:22:55.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2336
02:22:55.020 --> 02:22:56.430
<v Speaker 3>it's that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2337
02:22:56.431 --> 02:22:59.340
<v Speaker 3>one problem that you solve is replaced </v>
<v Speaker 3>by another problem.</v>

2338
02:22:59.341 --> 02:23:02.370
<v Speaker 3>And so the idea that you're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>happy when you solve all your problems,</v>

2339
02:23:02.371 --> 02:23:05.310
<v Speaker 3>it's like good luck with that theory.</v>

2340
02:23:05.850 --> 02:23:07.860
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

2341
02:23:07.861 --> 02:23:12.861
<v Speaker 3>if you're aiming at something worthwhile</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you really believe it's worthwhile </v>

2342
02:23:12.861 --> 02:23:12.861
<v Speaker 3>and you've thought it through,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2343
02:23:12.861 --> 02:23:14.610
<v Speaker 3>so that you're not weak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not weak,</v>

2344
02:23:14.611 --> 02:23:16.560
<v Speaker 3>you've got your damn arguments,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mustard.</v>

2345
02:23:16.860 --> 02:23:18.720
<v Speaker 3>Then when you make progress even a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit,</v>

2346
02:23:18.721 --> 02:23:19.200
<v Speaker 3>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2347
02:23:19.201 --> 02:23:20.970
<v Speaker 3>that's all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you get a little kick,</v>

2348
02:23:21.200 --> 02:23:23.880
<v Speaker 3>a little dopamine kick and that's what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you want.</v>

2349
02:23:23.930 --> 02:23:25.920
<v Speaker 3>Cause that's where your positive emotion</v>
<v Speaker 3>comes from.</v>

2350
02:23:26.130 --> 02:23:27.950
<v Speaker 3>You can use cocaine if you want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

2351
02:23:29.340 --> 02:23:34.340
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that tends to have relatively </v>

2352
02:23:34.340 --> 02:23:35.280
<v Speaker 3>detrimental medium to longterm </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequences,</v>

2353
02:23:35.400 --> 02:23:40.400
<v Speaker 3>but it activates the same system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you have to be aiming at something </v>

2354
02:23:40.400 --> 02:23:43.200
<v Speaker 3>and you should be aiming at something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's realistic that you want,</v>

2355
02:23:43.920 --> 02:23:45.570
<v Speaker 3>that you could get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2356
02:23:45.600 --> 02:23:47.940
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not easily because if it's easy,</v>

2357
02:23:48.210 --> 02:23:50.720
<v Speaker 3>in some sense you've already got it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's got to push you.</v>

2358
02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:52.860
<v Speaker 3>And that's part of the pleasure </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually,</v>

2359
02:23:52.861 --> 02:23:57.861
<v Speaker 3>because there's two things that you want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do when you're pursuing something </v>

2360
02:23:57.861 --> 02:23:59.400
<v Speaker 3>that's important and one of them is to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get the thing that's important.</v>

2361
02:23:59.610 --> 02:24:04.610
<v Speaker 3>But the other is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is to make yourself better at pursuing </v>

2362
02:24:04.610 --> 02:24:04.610
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2363
02:24:04.610 --> 02:24:07.260
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you can get both of those at the same</v>

2364
02:24:07.261 --> 02:24:07.890
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2365
02:24:08.220 --> 02:24:13.220
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're aiming at something and you're </v>

2366
02:24:13.220 --> 02:24:13.220
<v Speaker 3>increasing your competence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like that's a good deal.</v>

2367
02:24:13.220 --> 02:24:17.160
<v Speaker 3>That's a good deal and there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>intrinsic meaning to be felt in that.</v>

2368
02:24:17.161 --> 02:24:20.100
<v Speaker 3>And then the second half of the program,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2369
02:24:21.540 --> 02:24:26.540
<v Speaker 3>you write out a plan for how you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to do it and how are you going to </v>

2370
02:24:26.540 --> 02:24:27.600
<v Speaker 3>keep yourself on track and you're gonna </v>
<v Speaker 3>write about why it would be good for you</v>

2371
02:24:27.601 --> 02:24:32.601
<v Speaker 3>if you did this and why it would be good</v>
<v Speaker 3>for your family and what possible </v>

2372
02:24:32.601 --> 02:24:32.980
<v Speaker 3>benefits it would have to the community,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2373
02:24:33.060 --> 02:24:38.060
<v Speaker 3>because you want to nail this thing down</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you want to figure out what </v>

2374
02:24:38.060 --> 02:24:42.261
<v Speaker 3>kind of obstacles are going to come up </v>
<v Speaker 3>and how you might overcome them and how </v>

2375
02:24:42.261 --> 02:24:42.720
<v Speaker 3>you might keep yourself on track and all</v>
<v Speaker 3>of that.</v>

2376
02:24:42.720 --> 02:24:47.720
<v Speaker 3>And we know because we've actually done </v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of research on this particular </v>

2377
02:24:47.720 --> 02:24:51.741
<v Speaker 3>program that if university students do </v>
<v Speaker 3>this and this is more true,</v>

2378
02:24:52.081 --> 02:24:55.320
<v Speaker 3>if they're not too well oriented to </v>
<v Speaker 3>begin with.</v>

2379
02:24:55.860 --> 02:25:00.860
<v Speaker 3>If University students do this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're about 25 percent less likely to </v>

2380
02:25:00.860 --> 02:25:03.390
<v Speaker 3>drop out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is lot and about their grade point</v>

2381
02:25:03.391 --> 02:25:08.010
<v Speaker 3>average increases about 20 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Hooray for that,</v>

2382
02:25:08.070 --> 02:25:13.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you never know when you develop </v>

2383
02:25:13.070 --> 02:25:13.070
<v Speaker 3>an intervention,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's gonna work,</v>

2384
02:25:13.070 --> 02:25:14.220
<v Speaker 3>there's also evidence but not from my </v>
<v Speaker 3>lab.</v>

2385
02:25:14.850 --> 02:25:19.850
<v Speaker 3>That doing such things improves your </v>
<v Speaker 3>physical health and I think the reason </v>

2386
02:25:19.850 --> 02:25:23.931
<v Speaker 3>for that is is that you know when you go</v>
<v Speaker 3>over your autobiography and you scour </v>

2387
02:25:23.931 --> 02:25:25.720
<v Speaker 3>out those negative places that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of dragging along with you,</v>

2388
02:25:25.900 --> 02:25:29.770
<v Speaker 3>it lowers your overall stress load </v>
<v Speaker 3>because your brain is kind of.</v>

2389
02:25:29.771 --> 02:25:34.771
<v Speaker 3>I think it's calculating how dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world is by attending to the ratio </v>

2390
02:25:35.501 --> 02:25:39.040
<v Speaker 3>of successes to failures that you've had</v>
<v Speaker 3>in your life.</v>

2391
02:25:39.041 --> 02:25:41.200
<v Speaker 3>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you know,</v>

2392
02:25:41.201 --> 02:25:44.260
<v Speaker 3>if there are holes in your map that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>could still fall through,</v>

2393
02:25:44.261 --> 02:25:49.030
<v Speaker 3>then your brain regards the territory </v>
<v Speaker 3>still as a bit on the dangerous side and</v>

2394
02:25:49.031 --> 02:25:52.750
<v Speaker 3>then you more prepared for emergency </v>
<v Speaker 3>action and that's hard on you.</v>

2395
02:25:52.870 --> 02:25:55.690
<v Speaker 3>So you want to go back there and fix up </v>
<v Speaker 3>those</v>

2396
02:25:57.590 --> 02:25:59.870
<v Speaker 3>experiences is to the degree that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can.</v>

2397
02:26:00.140 --> 02:26:05.140
<v Speaker 3>Now those are going to be peer rated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that's complicated,</v>

2398
02:26:05.871 --> 02:26:07.130
<v Speaker 3>but here's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's how you do it,</v>

2399
02:26:07.760 --> 02:26:12.760
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing so that you have written it </v>

2400
02:26:12.760 --> 02:26:16.841
<v Speaker 3>for you and then take everything out </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're not comfortable sharing with</v>

2401
02:26:17.361 --> 02:26:21.140
<v Speaker 3>other people and so there's a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 3>reasons I do it that way.</v>

2402
02:26:21.260 --> 02:26:26.260
<v Speaker 3>One is just that there's just no other </v>
<v Speaker 3>way to do it because if I want to do </v>

2403
02:26:26.260 --> 02:26:29.450
<v Speaker 3>this with you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the grading load is too high to do it.</v>

2404
02:26:30.110 --> 02:26:31.640
<v Speaker 3>So I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2405
02:26:31.641 --> 02:26:36.641
<v Speaker 3>it's still worth doing and because this </v>
<v Speaker 3>is a class about narrative and about </v>

2406
02:26:36.641 --> 02:26:40.091
<v Speaker 3>self narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the right thing to do and most of </v>

2407
02:26:40.091 --> 02:26:40.790
<v Speaker 3>you are graduating soon and it's like </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a helpful.</v>

2408
02:26:40.940 --> 02:26:45.940
<v Speaker 3>I think you'll find it very helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what students report and so </v>

2409
02:26:45.940 --> 02:26:50.440
<v Speaker 3>you'll each read three people will read </v>
<v Speaker 3>each of your</v>

2410
02:26:54.190 --> 02:26:59.190
<v Speaker 3>offerings and give you a grade and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>you get the average of the best two </v>

2411
02:26:59.190 --> 02:27:02.971
<v Speaker 3>grades and they're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're supposed to provide you with </v>

2412
02:27:02.971 --> 02:27:05.131
<v Speaker 3>constructive feedback and constructive </v>
<v Speaker 3>feedback is sort of mostly what did you </v>

2413
02:27:05.131 --> 02:27:05.131
<v Speaker 3>do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2414
02:27:05.770 --> 02:27:07.840
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and maybe some hints about where you can</v>

2415
02:27:07.841 --> 02:27:08.920
<v Speaker 3>flesh it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And all that,</v>

2416
02:27:09.490 --> 02:27:12.610
<v Speaker 3>but so that's that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you need to write an essay.</v>

2417
02:27:13.190 --> 02:27:14.890
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is all detailed on the,</v>

2418
02:27:14.891 --> 02:27:19.450
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the website and that's the website.</v>

2419
02:27:19.570 --> 02:27:22.450
<v Speaker 3>If you go to Jordan Peterson.com</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the left,</v>

2420
02:27:22.660 --> 02:27:25.120
<v Speaker 3>there's classes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he clicked classes you get a bunch of</v>

2421
02:27:25.121 --> 02:27:29.230
<v Speaker 3>tabs and one of the towns is psych for </v>
<v Speaker 3>34 and that's obviously this class.</v>

2422
02:27:29.231 --> 02:27:33.030
<v Speaker 3>And so the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some extra readings on there and</v>

2423
02:27:33.330 --> 02:27:35.560
<v Speaker 3>a list of how we're going to go through </v>
<v Speaker 3>the course.</v>

2424
02:27:36.070 --> 02:27:39.550
<v Speaker 3>The dates aren't right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I gotta update it and I haven't finished</v>

2425
02:27:39.551 --> 02:27:42.010
<v Speaker 3>that yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the rest of it's pretty much the way</v>

2426
02:27:42.011 --> 02:27:42.370
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>

2427
02:27:42.760 --> 02:27:45.170
<v Speaker 3>This writing program is an online </v>
<v Speaker 3>program and it,</v>

2428
02:27:45.330 --> 02:27:47.320
<v Speaker 3>it guides you through the process of </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing it,</v>

2429
02:27:47.321 --> 02:27:52.321
<v Speaker 3>but really I would really recommend that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you start like this week because it also</v>

2430
02:27:54.701 --> 02:27:58.930
<v Speaker 3>works better if you do it over time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it seems like in bursts of writing,</v>

2431
02:27:58.931 --> 02:28:01.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and to sleep in between episodes because</v>

2432
02:28:01.691 --> 02:28:04.480
<v Speaker 3>that's when your brain consolidates its </v>
<v Speaker 3>new information.</v>

2433
02:28:05.080 --> 02:28:09.570
<v Speaker 3>And I would say do it meditatively,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2434
02:28:09.820 --> 02:28:12.070
<v Speaker 3>ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ask yourself.</v>

2435
02:28:12.071 --> 02:28:17.071
<v Speaker 3>It's a different way of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really funny what happens when you </v>

2436
02:28:17.071 --> 02:28:20.341
<v Speaker 3>ask yourself questions because part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>you will answer and you don't know what </v>

2437
02:28:20.341 --> 02:28:23.791
<v Speaker 3>the answer will be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but an answer comes almost always and </v>

2438
02:28:23.791 --> 02:28:24.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you think,</v>

2439
02:28:24.381 --> 02:28:29.381
<v Speaker 3>well what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happened to me when I was six </v>

2440
02:28:29.381 --> 02:28:31.601
<v Speaker 3>around six that was important and </v>
<v Speaker 3>through some mysterious process,</v>

2441
02:28:32.510 --> 02:28:37.510
<v Speaker 3>perhaps a memory will come to mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's a test.</v>

2442
02:28:38.780 --> 02:28:42.530
<v Speaker 3>So there's these two side mounts plus </v>
<v Speaker 3>the essay.</v>

2443
02:28:43.280 --> 02:28:48.280
<v Speaker 3>The essay can be in anything you want </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's related to the class.</v>

2444
02:28:49.220 --> 02:28:51.650
<v Speaker 3>You have to make the case that it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>related to the class.</v>

2445
02:28:52.130 --> 02:28:56.670
<v Speaker 3>So it's an opportunity to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2446
02:28:56.690 --> 02:28:59.870
<v Speaker 3>to write about something you want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>write about</v>

2447
02:29:02.800 --> 02:29:05.680
<v Speaker 3>and there's a final exam and the final </v>
<v Speaker 3>exam,</v>

2448
02:29:05.890 --> 02:29:07.660
<v Speaker 3>if you read the book and you come to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>classes,</v>

2449
02:29:07.690 --> 02:29:09.990
<v Speaker 3>do you won't have any problem with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>final exam because it's not,</v>

2450
02:29:10.840 --> 02:29:15.840
<v Speaker 3>it's not tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a survey of what we've gone </v>

2451
02:29:15.840 --> 02:29:18.190
<v Speaker 3>through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I did that.</v>

2452
02:29:18.191 --> 02:29:20.920
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have that to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

2453
02:29:20.921 --> 02:29:24.310
<v Speaker 3>you need a carrot and a stick because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys are busy and you know,</v>

2454
02:29:24.410 --> 02:29:29.410
<v Speaker 3>you're going to treat outage and do the </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that are crucial and perhaps not </v>

2455
02:29:29.410 --> 02:29:33.631
<v Speaker 3>the things that aren't and no wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I had to make this crucial because </v>

2456
02:29:33.631 --> 02:29:36.850
<v Speaker 3>otherwise you won't read it and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>partly because it's hard and so,</v>

2457
02:29:36.940 --> 02:29:40.420
<v Speaker 3>but hopefully the course lectures will </v>
<v Speaker 3>help guide you through it.</v>

2458
02:29:40.990 --> 02:29:45.990
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's about that.</v>

2459
02:29:48.520 --> 02:29:53.520
<v Speaker 3>So I'm going to tell you a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>stories and I'm going to try to explain </v>

2460
02:29:53.520 --> 02:29:57.511
<v Speaker 3>what they mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what I hope will happen is that the </v>

2461
02:29:57.511 --> 02:30:01.441
<v Speaker 3>world of narrative will open up for you </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that and like I found that </v>

2462
02:30:03.041 --> 02:30:08.041
<v Speaker 3>incredibly useful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's incredibly useful to understand </v>

2463
02:30:08.041 --> 02:30:09.340
<v Speaker 3>these things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It situates you better.</v>

2464
02:30:09.370 --> 02:30:14.370
<v Speaker 3>And it also helps you see what people </v>
<v Speaker 3>tell me about this course frequently is </v>

2465
02:30:14.370 --> 02:30:14.370
<v Speaker 3>that</v>

2466
02:30:18.660 --> 02:30:23.640
<v Speaker 3>it's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They already knew what I'm telling them,</v>

2467
02:30:25.020 --> 02:30:28.350
<v Speaker 3>but they didn't know that they knew it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it makes sense.</v>

2468
02:30:28.351 --> 02:30:29.880
<v Speaker 3>It clicks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it clicks.</v>

2469
02:30:30.540 --> 02:30:35.540
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me what that means is that you have </v>

2470
02:30:35.540 --> 02:30:37.791
<v Speaker 3>the information represented in you in an</v>
<v Speaker 3>action,</v>

2471
02:30:38.550 --> 02:30:42.630
<v Speaker 3>in your procedures and your habits and </v>
<v Speaker 3>in your perceptual structures.</v>

2472
02:30:42.631 --> 02:30:44.970
<v Speaker 3>It's implicit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the implicit you.</v>

2473
02:30:45.960 --> 02:30:46.560
<v Speaker 3>And then</v>

2474
02:30:48.560 --> 02:30:53.060
<v Speaker 3>I can articulate in part what that </v>
<v Speaker 3>implicit you is and it fits.</v>

2475
02:30:53.090 --> 02:30:54.020
<v Speaker 3>Click.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

2476
02:30:54.021 --> 02:30:55.430
<v Speaker 3>that's what I'm like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what people are like,</v>

2477
02:30:55.460 --> 02:30:58.820
<v Speaker 3>that's where people are like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so well,</v>

2478
02:30:58.821 --> 02:31:02.150
<v Speaker 3>if any of that happened today during </v>
<v Speaker 3>this lecture to you,</v>

2479
02:31:02.151 --> 02:31:04.130
<v Speaker 3>well then that's a good sign that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>might,</v>

2480
02:31:04.630 --> 02:31:06.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>benefit from the course.</v>

2481
02:31:06.201 --> 02:31:11.201
<v Speaker 3>And if it didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well you could try one more lecture and </v>

2482
02:31:11.201 --> 02:31:11.201
<v Speaker 3>see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2483
02:31:11.710 --> 02:31:14.270
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is sort of what the course is like.</v>

2484
02:31:15.560 --> 02:31:20.560
<v Speaker 3>And if that's what you want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then this is where you get it.</v>

2485
02:31:22.760 --> 02:31:25.400
<v Speaker 3>Good to see all of you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I guess we're done right.</v>
