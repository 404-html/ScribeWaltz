00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:42.343
<v Speaker 1>Creative people are getting a really </v>
<v Speaker 1>rough or they're not getting a break at </v>

2
00:03:45.891 --> 00:03:46.724
<v Speaker 1>all and there are probably more creative</v>
<v Speaker 1>people doing non creative work in the </v>

3
00:03:49.941 --> 00:03:52.580
<v Speaker 1>workforce than the other way around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh definitely,</v>

4
00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.190
<v Speaker 1>definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the thing is,</v>

5
00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to paint too dismal a </v>
<v Speaker 1>picture about being creative because one</v>

6
00:03:58.791 --> 00:03:59.624
<v Speaker 1>of the things that pays off big for </v>
<v Speaker 1>creative people is that they get to be </v>

7
00:04:01.671 --> 00:04:02.481
<v Speaker 1>creative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

8
00:04:02.481 --> 00:04:05.090
<v Speaker 1>There's great aesthetic joy in that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>depth,</v>

9
00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.313
<v Speaker 1>and I've been privileged because I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>worked with more creative people than </v>

10
00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.320
<v Speaker 1>than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than would fall to the law,</v>

11
00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:13.213
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the typical psychotherapist because </v>

12
00:04:14.451 --> 00:04:15.284
<v Speaker 1>people often come and see me because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've watched my videos online and </v>

13
00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.883
<v Speaker 1>they deal with people who are interested</v>
<v Speaker 1>in those subjects tend to be creative </v>

14
00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.430
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things I've really been </v>
<v Speaker 1>struck by,</v>

15
00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:26.593
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've learned that for those of you who </v>

16
00:04:27.861 --> 00:04:31.910
<v Speaker 1>are interested in such things that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason human psychology works is because</v>

17
00:04:31.911 --> 00:04:33.170
<v Speaker 1>it works for creative people.</v>

18
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.120
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't work at all for non creative </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

19
00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.660
<v Speaker 1>It's just false and slot for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not interested in it.</v>

20
00:04:38.661 --> 00:04:39.770
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't how they think.</v>

21
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.270
<v Speaker 1>You mean as therapy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

22
00:04:41.271 --> 00:04:44.150
<v Speaker 1>there that it doesn't match.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't match their personalities.</v>

23
00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.560
<v Speaker 1>Whereas creative people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

24
00:04:45.561 --> 00:04:47.330
<v Speaker 1>they dream market typical dreams all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

25
00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.820
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting and also they </v>
<v Speaker 1>die if they're,</v>

26
00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.310
<v Speaker 1>if they're not being creative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wither on the vine.</v>

27
00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.130
<v Speaker 1>I had one client,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really liked him.</v>

28
00:04:55.131 --> 00:04:55.964
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a brilliant architect and his </v>

29
00:04:58.821 --> 00:05:02.090
<v Speaker 1>rational mind was his worst enemy </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it just criticized everything.</v>

30
00:05:02.091 --> 00:05:02.924
<v Speaker 1>He was hyper rational,</v>
<v Speaker 1>criticized everything and really in a </v>

31
00:05:04.761 --> 00:05:06.460
<v Speaker 1>dark way and effectively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

32
00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.370
<v Speaker 1>is that if I could get him to not think </v>
<v Speaker 1>and just create,</v>

33
00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.950
<v Speaker 1>he was a complete genius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could.</v>

34
00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.530
<v Speaker 1>That's where all of the vitality in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>life was.</v>

35
00:05:15.531 --> 00:05:16.364
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where the sap rose up inside the </v>

36
00:05:17.901 --> 00:05:18.734
<v Speaker 1>dead tree that was sort of embedded </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside of him and it's very common with </v>

37
00:05:21.921 --> 00:05:26.060
<v Speaker 1>creative people is that it's their life </v>
<v Speaker 1>blood and it really is from a biological</v>

38
00:05:26.061 --> 00:05:28.100
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This isn't some EPA phenomena.</v>

39
00:05:28.101 --> 00:05:28.671
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

40
00:05:28.671 --> 00:05:30.560
<v Speaker 1>it's built right into people in deeply.</v>
