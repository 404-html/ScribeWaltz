00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:04.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm Dr. Jordan B.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peterson,</v>

2
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.960
<v Speaker 1>a psychology professor at the University</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Toronto in Canada.</v>

3
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tell you the story behind </v>
<v Speaker 1>the self authoring suite website.</v>

4
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:14.553
<v Speaker 1>A few years ago I realized that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>students in my classes had written </v>

5
00:00:16.751 --> 00:00:19.540
<v Speaker 1>essays on all sorts of subjects in grade</v>
<v Speaker 1>school and college.</v>

6
00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:21.063
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd never been asked to write </v>

7
00:00:22.151 --> 00:00:26.470
<v Speaker 1>thoughtfully about themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about their own past experiences,</v>

8
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.350
<v Speaker 1>personalities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and visions for their futures.</v>

9
00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.020
<v Speaker 1>Upon reflection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just lack of opportunity.</v>

10
00:00:33.021 --> 00:00:33.854
<v Speaker 1>He struck me as strange to say the least</v>
<v Speaker 1>since there's nothing more important to </v>

11
00:00:37.631 --> 00:00:40.240
<v Speaker 1>get straight than your own personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

12
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.923
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was speaking with managers at various </v>

13
00:00:44.551 --> 00:00:46.920
<v Speaker 1>companies about how to hire more </v>
<v Speaker 1>effective workers.</v>

14
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.863
<v Speaker 1>They were much more interested in how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>improve the performance of poorly </v>

15
00:00:50.941 --> 00:00:53.100
<v Speaker 1>performing people they had already </v>
<v Speaker 1>hired.</v>

16
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:55.523
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have much to tell them at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time because improving people is very </v>

17
00:00:58.141 --> 00:01:00.900
<v Speaker 1>difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>

18
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.610
<v Speaker 1>the two problems stuck in my mind,</v>

19
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.483
<v Speaker 1>so I started to search for psychological</v>
<v Speaker 1>interventions that could be used widely </v>

20
00:01:08.881 --> 00:01:11.880
<v Speaker 1>and practically to clarify and improve </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's lives.</v>

21
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.233
<v Speaker 1>I already knew that people lived inside </v>
<v Speaker 1>the stories they told about themselves </v>

22
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.340
<v Speaker 1>and that they use those stories to </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpret everything around them.</v>

23
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.280
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>considering this,</v>

24
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.143
<v Speaker 1>I came up on Dr. James Pennebaker's </v>
<v Speaker 1>research conducted at the University of </v>

25
00:01:27.871 --> 00:01:28.704
<v Speaker 1>Texas at Austin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr Pennebaker tested Sigmund Freud's </v>

26
00:01:31.921 --> 00:01:32.754
<v Speaker 1>theory that the release of emotions </v>
<v Speaker 1>related to traumatic events could be </v>

27
00:01:36.451 --> 00:01:39.780
<v Speaker 1>curative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had his students write for three days</v>

28
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.250
<v Speaker 1>for 15 minutes a day about the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>upsetting experiences of their lives.</v>

29
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.030
<v Speaker 1>While the control group wrote about </v>
<v Speaker 1>ordinary daily activities,</v>

30
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.213
<v Speaker 1>those in the former group experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>longterm improvements in their </v>

31
00:01:53.221 --> 00:01:56.700
<v Speaker 1>psychological and physical health after </v>
<v Speaker 1>a brief dip in mood,</v>

32
00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.600
<v Speaker 1>not so much because of the expression of</v>
<v Speaker 1>pent up feelings,</v>

33
00:02:00.601 --> 00:02:01.434
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because they drew more specific </v>

34
00:02:03.511 --> 00:02:07.080
<v Speaker 1>causal conclusions about what had </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened to them in the past.</v>

35
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.843
<v Speaker 1>Dr. Laura King had her subjects right </v>
<v Speaker 1>about their ideals and future goals </v>

36
00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.730
<v Speaker 1>instead that they experienced the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefits.</v>

37
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:16.493
<v Speaker 1>Our research team specifically tested </v>
<v Speaker 1>the effects of the future authoring </v>

38
00:02:19.171 --> 00:02:21.900
<v Speaker 1>program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of the self authoring suite related</v>

39
00:02:21.901 --> 00:02:24.900
<v Speaker 1>to goal setting have mcgill university </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Montreal,</v>

40
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.080
<v Speaker 1>Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Rasmus University in Rotterdam.</v>

41
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.183
<v Speaker 1>It academically struggling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Miguel students increased their grades </v>

42
00:02:33.181 --> 00:02:38.181
<v Speaker 1>by 25% in one year and decrease their </v>
<v Speaker 1>dropout rates from 30% to zero.</v>

43
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.213
<v Speaker 1>The same thing happened at Erasmus </v>
<v Speaker 1>University with more than 1200 business </v>

44
00:02:44.431 --> 00:02:45.264
<v Speaker 1>students.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These affects you not just apply to </v>

45
00:02:47.851 --> 00:02:50.760
<v Speaker 1>students either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr. Frank Smith,</v>

46
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.440
<v Speaker 1>one of the world's outstanding </v>
<v Speaker 1>industrial psychologists as demonstrated</v>

47
00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:56.603
<v Speaker 1>that participating in such programs </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes all kinds of people substantially </v>

48
00:03:00.131 --> 00:03:02.290
<v Speaker 1>more effective or whatever they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

49
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.923
<v Speaker 1>People who complete sex programs appear </v>
<v Speaker 1>to benefit because the careful </v>

50
00:03:07.931 --> 00:03:08.764
<v Speaker 1>articulation of their experiences past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>present and future decreases misery </v>

51
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:14.673
<v Speaker 1>related to threat and uncertainty and </v>
<v Speaker 1>increases happiness and hope which </v>

52
00:03:18.431 --> 00:03:22.210
<v Speaker 1>people experience when they progressed </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards somewhere they truly want to be.</v>

53
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.620
<v Speaker 1>When complicated experiences are </v>
<v Speaker 1>carefully put into words,</v>

54
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.040
<v Speaker 1>the manner in which they are represented</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the brain changes.</v>

55
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:31.713
<v Speaker 1>They moved from the areas associated </v>
<v Speaker 1>with stressfully motion demanding </v>

56
00:03:34.961 --> 00:03:35.794
<v Speaker 1>constant physical readiness to the areas</v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with detailed comprehension </v>

57
00:03:39.581 --> 00:03:40.414
<v Speaker 1>and understanding just makes articulate </v>
<v Speaker 1>people less stressed and more informed </v>

58
00:03:45.161 --> 00:03:48.370
<v Speaker 1>about how to be successful now and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the future.</v>

59
00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.450
<v Speaker 1>It is for these reasons that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>developed a self authoring suite,</v>

60
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.790
<v Speaker 1>a set of four interactive online writing</v>
<v Speaker 1>programs and are offering them to anyone</v>

61
00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.670
<v Speaker 1>who wants to concentrate on improving </v>
<v Speaker 1>his or her life.</v>

62
00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.740
<v Speaker 1>If you want to understand yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>

63
00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:05.413
<v Speaker 1>become less anxious and happier and </v>
<v Speaker 1>commit yourself more firmly to your </v>

64
00:04:08.761 --> 00:04:11.790
<v Speaker 1>education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>career or your relationships,</v>

65
00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:13.283
<v Speaker 1>these programs will help a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each of the programs is composed of a </v>

66
00:04:18.031 --> 00:04:18.864
<v Speaker 1>series of interactive web pages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the present you a specific personal </v>

67
00:04:21.661 --> 00:04:25.020
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This simplifies and guides the difficult</v>

68
00:04:25.021 --> 00:04:25.854
<v Speaker 1>process of personal writing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each program requires careful thought </v>

69
00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.863
<v Speaker 1>and take several hours to complete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is better to write over a number of </v>

70
00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.270
<v Speaker 1>days so that you have time to think and </v>
<v Speaker 1>because sleep aids the process,</v>

71
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:41.303
<v Speaker 1>the writing is challenging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the experimentally documented </v>

72
00:04:44.161 --> 00:04:45.570
<v Speaker 1>benefits are worth it.</v>

73
00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.510
<v Speaker 1>The past authoring program helps you </v>
<v Speaker 1>write an autobiography.</v>

74
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.510
<v Speaker 1>It will present you with pages like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

75
00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:54.733
<v Speaker 1>introducing you to the program</v>
<v Speaker 1>and providing psychologically sound </v>

76
00:04:59.031 --> 00:05:04.031
<v Speaker 1>advice and information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will then ask you to start writing,</v>

77
00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.760
<v Speaker 1>dividing your life into seven eip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pocs or sections,</v>

78
00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.620
<v Speaker 1>and describing the important experiences</v>
<v Speaker 1>of each the to present.</v>

79
00:05:13.621 --> 00:05:16.050
<v Speaker 1>All three programs help you address your</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality,</v>

80
00:05:16.051 --> 00:05:21.051
<v Speaker 1>faults and capitalize on your virtues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you start either of these programs,</v>

81
00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.850
<v Speaker 1>you will also be presented with </v>
<v Speaker 1>instruction pages.</v>

82
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.760
<v Speaker 1>Then you'll be provided with a list of </v>
<v Speaker 1>adjectives,</v>

83
00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.923
<v Speaker 1>some of which will accurately define you</v>
<v Speaker 1>and be asked to select six to nine </v>

84
00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.933
<v Speaker 1>describing your faults.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're feeling up to a challenge or </v>

85
00:05:36.331 --> 00:05:38.790
<v Speaker 1>your virtues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you could use a boost,</v>

86
00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:41.123
<v Speaker 1>he will then be asked to rank order </v>
<v Speaker 1>these adjectives and to write a </v>

87
00:05:43.291 --> 00:05:47.490
<v Speaker 1>paragraph describing a time when each </v>
<v Speaker 1>had a specific effect on your life.</v>

88
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.983
<v Speaker 1>The future authoring program helps you </v>
<v Speaker 1>define the future that would work best </v>

89
00:05:52.291 --> 00:05:54.660
<v Speaker 1>for you three to five years down the </v>
<v Speaker 1>road,</v>

90
00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.420
<v Speaker 1>and just as importantly to describe the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future you want to avoid.</v>

91
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:01.423
<v Speaker 1>It starts with some questions like these</v>
<v Speaker 1>which will start you thinking in the </v>

92
00:06:04.221 --> 00:06:05.054
<v Speaker 1>right direction.</v>

93
00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:15.253
<v Speaker 1>Then it will ask you to write freely </v>
<v Speaker 1>about what you want and don't want and </v>

94
00:06:18.621 --> 00:06:22.220
<v Speaker 1>about how to justify your decisions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stay on the right track.</v>

95
00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.290
<v Speaker 1>The programs contain much more detailed </v>
<v Speaker 1>than this brief summary Presents.</v>

96
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.670
<v Speaker 1>Here are the sorts of additional </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions you will be asked to consider.</v>

97
00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:35.300
<v Speaker 1>What were your 10 most important </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences?</v>

98
00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:36.793
<v Speaker 1>Were they positive or negative?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did each experience change you or </v>

99
00:06:40.551 --> 00:06:41.384
<v Speaker 1>your view of other people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were there things that you should have </v>

100
00:06:44.331 --> 00:06:48.080
<v Speaker 1>done differently?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you the life of the party?</v>

101
00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.820
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel comfortable around people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think before you act?</v>

102
00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:57.050
<v Speaker 1>Are you full of ideas?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you a sensible person?</v>

103
00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:03.170
<v Speaker 1>Do you do things according to a plan?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you too quiet around strangers?</v>

104
00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:05.660
<v Speaker 1>Do you daydream too much?</v>

105
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:09.350
<v Speaker 1>What is one thing that you could do </v>
<v Speaker 1>better?</v>

106
00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:11.413
<v Speaker 1>What do you want to learn about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How should you handle your drinking or </v>

107
00:07:15.411 --> 00:07:19.490
<v Speaker 1>drug use?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Describe your ideal social life.</v>

108
00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:27.560
<v Speaker 1>You may choose to complete any or all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the four programs.</v>

109
00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:29.713
<v Speaker 1>You'll be given a confidential user name</v>
<v Speaker 1>and account password and your writing </v>

110
00:07:32.661 --> 00:07:37.010
<v Speaker 1>will be securely stored.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you have completed each program,</v>

111
00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:38.083
<v Speaker 1>you'll receive an organized </v>
<v Speaker 1>comprehensive email laying out the work </v>

112
00:07:41.211 --> 00:07:42.044
<v Speaker 1>that you have done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can return to the programs in the </v>

113
00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:45.464
<v Speaker 1>future to edit and update your work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many people do not understand who they </v>

114
00:07:51.381 --> 00:07:52.910
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they are,</v>

115
00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:56.150
<v Speaker 1>or where they are going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In consequence,</v>

116
00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:57.283
<v Speaker 1>instead of attempting those actions that</v>
