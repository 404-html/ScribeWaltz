00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:05.090
<v Speaker 1>On Wednesday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 31st of January at 7:30 PM,</v>

2
00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:06.583
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be speaking about my new </v>
<v Speaker 1>book and its genesis at the lovely </v>

3
00:00:11.361 --> 00:00:16.361
<v Speaker 1>orpheum theater in Los Angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I'd like to invite you to attend.</v>

4
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.270
<v Speaker 1>I'll talk for about an hour and a half </v>
<v Speaker 1>or so perhaps to take questions from the</v>

5
00:00:22.371 --> 00:00:23.204
<v Speaker 1>audience and then sign and dedicate </v>
<v Speaker 1>books and so if you'd be interested in </v>

6
00:00:26.961 --> 00:00:27.794
<v Speaker 1>hearing about 12 rules for life and </v>
<v Speaker 1>about how it came about and what it's </v>

7
00:00:31.521 --> 00:00:32.354
<v Speaker 1>about and why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then please come to the theater and </v>

8
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.800
<v Speaker 1>we'll have a fine time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So looking forward to seeing you there.</v>

9
00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:43.363
<v Speaker 2>12 rules for life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to live properly in the face of </v>

10
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.380
<v Speaker 2>vulnerability,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tragedy,</v>

11
00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:49.214
<v Speaker 2>and malevolence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the propositions in 12 rules for </v>

12
00:00:53.541 --> 00:00:58.541
<v Speaker 2>life is that life existence is usefully </v>
<v Speaker 2>characterized as an interplant order and</v>

13
00:01:00.411 --> 00:01:01.244
<v Speaker 2>chaos or unknown unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're always striving to balance those </v>

14
00:01:04.551 --> 00:01:05.870
<v Speaker 2>two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If if,</v>

15
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.043
<v Speaker 2>if what you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're doing is too familiar your </v>

16
00:01:08.451 --> 00:01:10.940
<v Speaker 2>board and if what you're doing is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>unfamiliar,</v>

17
00:01:10.941 --> 00:01:11.774
<v Speaker 2>then you're anxious and what you want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do is find the harmonious line between </v>

18
00:01:17.691 --> 00:01:21.590
<v Speaker 2>those two and that signified by leaning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you can get those two things right,</v>

19
00:01:21.591 --> 00:01:23.150
<v Speaker 2>then you can have your cake and eat it </v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

20
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.920
<v Speaker 2>I hope people can take away the idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there is a motive being in the face</v>

21
00:01:30.651 --> 00:01:31.484
<v Speaker 2>of the vulnerability and tragedy of life</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is noble and powerful and capable </v>

22
00:01:38.961 --> 00:01:39.794
<v Speaker 2>of sustaining them through the worst </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible times without becoming corrupt </v>

23
00:01:44.511 --> 00:01:45.344
<v Speaker 2>and bitter.</v>
