00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:04.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many of you got my </v>
<v Speaker 1>email this morning,</v>

2
00:00:04.581 --> 00:00:05.414
<v Speaker 1>but this is the last class and so I sent</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my email a link to the other lecture </v>

3
00:00:11.301 --> 00:00:12.134
<v Speaker 1>that was supposed to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have to go to a conference on </v>

4
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:15.793
<v Speaker 1>Thursday and Friday and so I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do the last lecture today and you can </v>

5
00:00:18.681 --> 00:00:21.920
<v Speaker 1>watch the second glass lecture from last</v>
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>

6
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.970
<v Speaker 1>which will cover the territory hopefully</v>
<v Speaker 1>sufficiently well.</v>

7
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:27.853
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>I usually use the last lecture to sort </v>

8
00:00:32.661 --> 00:00:35.660
<v Speaker 1>of sum up where we've been and also to </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to people about.</v>

9
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.120
<v Speaker 2>Let me open that up here first</v>

10
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.250
<v Speaker 1>about my more specific thoughts on </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>

11
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.770
<v Speaker 1>So I think that's probably what I'll do </v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

12
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.650
<v Speaker 1>I'll start with with what we've where </v>
<v Speaker 1>we've been.</v>

13
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.093
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

14
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.333
<v Speaker 1>I started talking to you about </v>
<v Speaker 1>mythological representations of </v>

15
00:01:48.121 --> 00:01:53.121
<v Speaker 1>personality</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I wanted to do that for a variety of</v>

16
00:01:54.421 --> 00:01:58.020
<v Speaker 1>reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the most important was to place</v>

17
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.473
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the course in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a deep history context essentially </v>

18
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.190
<v Speaker 1>because personality is the consequence </v>
<v Speaker 1>of very many things and many of them are</v>

19
00:02:14.011 --> 00:02:17.160
<v Speaker 1>grounded in our biology and therefore </v>
<v Speaker 1>grounded in evolution.</v>

20
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.830
<v Speaker 1>And I generally think that in some ways </v>
<v Speaker 1>the social sciences don't take evolution</v>

21
00:02:26.071 --> 00:02:27.270
<v Speaker 1>seriously enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

22
00:02:27.271 --> 00:02:28.104
<v Speaker 1>they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't take the fact that we're </v>

23
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.500
<v Speaker 1>three and a half billion years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously enough.</v>

24
00:02:34.501 --> 00:02:39.501
<v Speaker 1>It's a serious thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some of that is evident</v>

25
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.790
<v Speaker 1>in a relatively straightforward way </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptually in that we share so much of</v>

26
00:02:47.251 --> 00:02:50.280
<v Speaker 1>our biological platform with other </v>
<v Speaker 1>creatures.</v>

27
00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.180
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a recent genomic analysis,</v>

28
00:02:54.181 --> 00:02:55.014
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of gorillas and I don't remember what </v>

29
00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.100
<v Speaker 1>percentage of our dna we share with </v>
<v Speaker 1>gorillas,</v>

30
00:03:00.101 --> 00:03:03.010
<v Speaker 1>but it's like 99 point two percent or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>

31
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.010
<v Speaker 1>which you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is quite shocking until you realize that</v>

32
00:03:06.011 --> 00:03:09.640
<v Speaker 1>we share about 70 percent of our genetic</v>
<v Speaker 1>makeup with yeast.</v>

33
00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:11.830
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

34
00:03:11.831 --> 00:03:14.470
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously we're a lot closer to gorillas</v>

35
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:15.603
<v Speaker 1>than to yeast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're still a pretty damn close to </v>

36
00:03:17.441 --> 00:03:18.274
<v Speaker 1>yeast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it also indicates not necessarily </v>

37
00:03:21.491 --> 00:03:24.220
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just how similar we are,</v>

38
00:03:24.221 --> 00:03:25.054
<v Speaker 1>two gorillas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how minor modifications in the </v>

39
00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:31.760
<v Speaker 1>genome can also make substantial </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences because like as we are,</v>

40
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.960
<v Speaker 1>two gorillas were a lot different from </v>
<v Speaker 1>them too.</v>

41
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:36.783
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

42
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.740
<v Speaker 1>So there's the biological aspect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really important.</v>

43
00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.620
<v Speaker 1>But then there's what you might describe</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a quasi biological element,</v>

44
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:48.483
<v Speaker 1>which seems to be operating in the space</v>
<v Speaker 1>between biology as evolutionarily </v>

45
00:03:53.711 --> 00:03:57.700
<v Speaker 1>determined that culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things are often,</v>

46
00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:58.773
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have an archetypal tendency to </v>

47
00:04:01.691 --> 00:04:04.540
<v Speaker 1>consider culture as something in </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposition to nature.</v>

48
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.090
<v Speaker 1>And there's utility in that from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>heuristic point of view.</v>

49
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.780
<v Speaker 1>You can do a lot without division from a</v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptual perspective.</v>

50
00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:15.453
<v Speaker 1>But in lots of ways it's misleading</v>
<v Speaker 1>because some of the primordial elements </v>

51
00:04:19.691 --> 00:04:24.691
<v Speaker 1>of culture or biological.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the most striking example of</v>

52
00:04:25.391 --> 00:04:30.391
<v Speaker 1>that fundamentally is</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two striking examples.</v>

53
00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:32.104
<v Speaker 1>One is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the existence of structures of power or </v>

54
00:04:37.511 --> 00:04:40.030
<v Speaker 1>structures of authority or structures of</v>
<v Speaker 1>influence,</v>

55
00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:45.210
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies which are incredibly old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least 400 million years old and,</v>

56
00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.910
<v Speaker 1>and which have in consequence being </v>
<v Speaker 1>around for so long that you also have to</v>

57
00:04:54.131 --> 00:04:56.020
<v Speaker 1>think about them as part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>

58
00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.030
<v Speaker 1>Part of nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

59
00:04:58.031 --> 00:04:58.864
<v Speaker 1>because we tend to think of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchical structure as cultural and </v>

60
00:05:03.881 --> 00:05:04.714
<v Speaker 1>also as easily alterable in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's no reason to think that </v>

61
00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.863
<v Speaker 1>given that it's been around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I pointed out in one lecture longer </v>

62
00:05:14.741 --> 00:05:17.110
<v Speaker 1>than trees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

63
00:05:17.111 --> 00:05:17.944
<v Speaker 1>it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very permanent element of the </v>

64
00:05:19.631 --> 00:05:22.210
<v Speaker 1>environment that human beings find </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves in.</v>

65
00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:23.613
<v Speaker 1>So much so that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can think of a dominance hierarchy </v>

66
00:05:26.321 --> 00:05:27.154
<v Speaker 1>as the prototype prototype of culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because it's been a constant </v>

67
00:05:31.361 --> 00:05:32.194
<v Speaker 1>environmental feature for so long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our nervous systems are built for </v>

68
00:05:35.831 --> 00:05:39.070
<v Speaker 1>operation within a hierarchy and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>really built that way.</v>

69
00:05:39.071 --> 00:05:44.071
<v Speaker 1>It's not a trivial matter because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know the serotonin systems that regulate</v>

70
00:05:45.311 --> 00:05:48.850
<v Speaker 1>our emotions because the serotonin </v>
<v Speaker 1>system does that fundamentally.</v>

71
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.930
<v Speaker 1>It's also the system that sets up your </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain during fetal development.</v>

72
00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.393
<v Speaker 1>The serotonin system is above all </v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps concerned with calibrating your </v>

73
00:05:59.301 --> 00:06:00.134
<v Speaker 1>nervous system in accordance with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>position in a hierarchy and it's basic </v>

74
00:06:04.521 --> 00:06:08.390
<v Speaker 1>rule is the higher in the hierarchy you </v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

75
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:09.763
<v Speaker 1>the less negative emotion you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel and the lower in a hierarchy you </v>

76
00:06:13.431 --> 00:06:18.431
<v Speaker 1>are and the more tenuous your actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>life because there's a direct connection</v>

77
00:06:18.441 --> 00:06:19.274
<v Speaker 1>between the tenuousness of your life and</v>
<v Speaker 1>your position in the dominance </v>

78
00:06:22.071 --> 00:06:22.904
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>

79
00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:23.983
<v Speaker 1>The more negative emotion you're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to feel and then not have drastic </v>

80
00:06:26.781 --> 00:06:31.781
<v Speaker 1>consequences and those are our best </v>
<v Speaker 1>exemplified in longevity.</v>

81
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:35.660
<v Speaker 1>So there was a famous study called the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Whitehall study,</v>

82
00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.940
<v Speaker 1>which was done in Britain and basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they were looking at,</v>

83
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:41.923
<v Speaker 1>the researchers were looking at was </v>
<v Speaker 1>health including mortality of English </v>

84
00:06:46.611 --> 00:06:50.930
<v Speaker 1>civil servants in the first study was </v>
<v Speaker 1>done 50 years before the second study.</v>

85
00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:53.690
<v Speaker 1>I think the second study was done in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>eighties.</v>

86
00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.320
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the first study,</v>

87
00:06:57.321 --> 00:07:01.070
<v Speaker 1>you have a power hierarchy and home with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the top civil servants at the talk,</v>

88
00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:01.913
<v Speaker 1>obviously in the bottom civil servants </v>
<v Speaker 1>out the bottom and you know you might </v>

89
00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:06.373
<v Speaker 1>ask yourself what constitutes top and </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom and some of it might be regarded </v>

90
00:07:11.601 --> 00:07:16.100
<v Speaker 1>as autonomy over choices and then that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that would be part of it.</v>

91
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.240
<v Speaker 1>You can make choices so you have a bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>more control over what's going to happen</v>

92
00:07:20.241 --> 00:07:23.510
<v Speaker 1>to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also the probability that you have a</v>

93
00:07:23.511 --> 00:07:26.720
<v Speaker 1>stable and productive place is higher.</v>

94
00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:27.583
<v Speaker 1>The higher you go and lower the lower </v>
<v Speaker 1>you go and the consequences of that all </v>

95
00:07:30.741 --> 00:07:34.130
<v Speaker 1>things considered is that the civil </v>
<v Speaker 1>servants out the bottom of the dominance</v>

96
00:07:34.131 --> 00:07:34.964
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy died,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are younger and more frequently than </v>

97
00:07:38.901 --> 00:07:39.734
<v Speaker 1>those at the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you could attribute that to poverty </v>

98
00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.510
<v Speaker 1>relevant to poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

99
00:07:44.511 --> 00:07:47.540
<v Speaker 1>Because of the people at the bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially say in the 19 thirties,</v>

100
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:51.500
<v Speaker 1>were materially deprived in comparison </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the people at the top.</v>

101
00:07:51.501 --> 00:07:55.370
<v Speaker 1>Although they certainly weren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>materially deprived in comparison,</v>

102
00:07:55.371 --> 00:08:00.110
<v Speaker 1>say to UK citizens a hundred years </v>
<v Speaker 1>before or to most people in the world at</v>

103
00:08:00.111 --> 00:08:01.970
<v Speaker 1>that time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

104
00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:03.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poverty argument is hard to make.</v>

105
00:08:03.771 --> 00:08:05.900
<v Speaker 1>Although what relative poverty argument </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

106
00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:06.943
<v Speaker 1>is easier to make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then 50 years later Britain was a </v>

107
00:08:10.821 --> 00:08:11.654
<v Speaker 1>lot richer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the absolute level of wealth of </v>

108
00:08:14.541 --> 00:08:15.374
<v Speaker 1>the entire hierarchy moved up </v>
<v Speaker 1>substantially so that the people at the </v>

109
00:08:19.071 --> 00:08:19.904
<v Speaker 1>bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're richer than the people at the </v>

110
00:08:21.381 --> 00:08:24.530
<v Speaker 1>middle in the previous study.</v>

111
00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:29.090
<v Speaker 1>But the pattern of overall overall </v>
<v Speaker 1>mortality remained quite similar.</v>

112
00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:30.723
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the importance of studies like that as </v>

113
00:08:33.741 --> 00:08:38.741
<v Speaker 1>well as studies that indicate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of income inequality on,</v>

114
00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:40.303
<v Speaker 1>on behavior are so important that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be put front and center in </v>

115
00:08:44.691 --> 00:08:47.480
<v Speaker 1>university curricula.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

116
00:08:47.481 --> 00:08:48.314
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that really bothers me</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the humanities education in </v>

117
00:08:52.251 --> 00:08:53.084
<v Speaker 1>particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although some of the social science </v>

118
00:08:54.171 --> 00:08:55.004
<v Speaker 1>education too for modern university </v>
<v Speaker 1>students is there are some things we </v>

119
00:08:57.841 --> 00:09:01.470
<v Speaker 1>know that you're never taught and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>really appalling,</v>

120
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:02.543
<v Speaker 1>especially the relative poverty issue </v>
<v Speaker 1>because most of the phenomena that </v>

121
00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:10.830
<v Speaker 1>people tend to attribute to poverty has </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing to do with poverty.</v>

122
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:11.993
<v Speaker 1>It's relative poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is absolutely not the same </v>

123
00:09:15.421 --> 00:09:19.320
<v Speaker 1>thing because the first one is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>material deprivation hypothesis.</v>

124
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:20.393
<v Speaker 1>But if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's almost no one in North America </v>

125
00:09:23.521 --> 00:09:26.900
<v Speaker 1>whose material lead deprived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you know,</v>

126
00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:28.000
<v Speaker 1>you could become mit.</v>

127
00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:31.980
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not saying there's no one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying there's almost no one.</v>

128
00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:33.173
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it also depends on your definition of </v>

129
00:09:34.351 --> 00:09:36.720
<v Speaker 1>material deprivation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But most people,</v>

130
00:09:36.721 --> 00:09:41.190
<v Speaker 1>the vast majority of people have too </v>
<v Speaker 1>much to eat and a place to live.</v>

131
00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:42.353
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you have plumbing and heating and </v>

132
00:09:45.421 --> 00:09:46.254
<v Speaker 1>food and access to information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've pretty much got everything that </v>

133
00:09:50.131 --> 00:09:53.070
<v Speaker 1>wealth can give you that isn't relative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

134
00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:58.160
<v Speaker 1>The privation part of it is gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But relative poverty,</v>

135
00:09:58.920 --> 00:09:59.753
<v Speaker 1>relative positions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably powerful determinant of </v>

136
00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:04.350
<v Speaker 1>almost everything that you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine.</v>

137
00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:08.370
<v Speaker 1>So longevity is one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>health is another.</v>

138
00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:09.930
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those are,</v>

139
00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:10.823
<v Speaker 1>a lot of those are stress related.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot more stressful at the bottom </v>

140
00:10:13.411 --> 00:10:14.244
<v Speaker 1>than it is at the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you something interesting we </v>

141
00:10:16.141 --> 00:10:19.890
<v Speaker 1>found out about conservatism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is when I wrote,</v>

142
00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:22.260
<v Speaker 1>I wrote a book called maps of meaning </v>
<v Speaker 1>along while back.</v>

143
00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:23.093
<v Speaker 1>And I realized that I was trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>account for why people are prone to </v>

144
00:10:28.381 --> 00:10:31.230
<v Speaker 1>identify so strongly with their belief </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems,</v>

145
00:10:31.231 --> 00:10:32.064
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and part of it in some sense was a </v>

146
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:38.040
<v Speaker 1>control over negative outcomes </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis.</v>

147
00:10:38.041 --> 00:10:41.310
<v Speaker 1>So partly if you have an ideological </v>
<v Speaker 1>theory,</v>

148
00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:46.820
<v Speaker 1>it's a set of tools that you can use </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite with quite a bit of proficiency to</v>

149
00:10:47.011 --> 00:10:48.160
<v Speaker 1>operate in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

150
00:10:48.161 --> 00:10:51.990
<v Speaker 1>It's a simplification strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enables you to control uncertainty.</v>

151
00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:54.270
<v Speaker 1>It also enables you to communicate with </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

152
00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:55.313
<v Speaker 1>But even more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the degree that we share a cultural </v>

153
00:10:59.851 --> 00:11:02.820
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can predict each other and that's not</v>

154
00:11:02.821 --> 00:11:03.654
<v Speaker 1>psychological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's you act out the game and I act out </v>

155
00:11:05.521 --> 00:11:06.354
<v Speaker 1>the game and so I don't have to really </v>
<v Speaker 1>know much about you and I don't have to </v>

156
00:11:09.811 --> 00:11:10.644
<v Speaker 1>assume that you're a barrel of snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can assume that you're more or less </v>

157
00:11:14.371 --> 00:11:14.970
<v Speaker 1>like me.</v>

158
00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:18.210
<v Speaker 1>And so if we interact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to be on constant alert.</v>

159
00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:22.020
<v Speaker 1>And so that's not a psychological </v>
<v Speaker 1>function of a belief system.</v>

160
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:25.350
<v Speaker 1>That's a direct real world function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you know,</v>

161
00:11:25.351 --> 00:11:28.140
<v Speaker 1>if you listen to people like the terror </v>
<v Speaker 1>management theorists,</v>

162
00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:29.243
<v Speaker 1>they're always telling you how belief </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems protect people against </v>

163
00:11:31.591 --> 00:11:34.770
<v Speaker 1>psychological uncertainty or maybe the </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fear of death.</v>

164
00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:39.980
<v Speaker 1>They never tell you that shared belief </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems actually prevent you from death,</v>

165
00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:43.950
<v Speaker 1>which is even more important than </v>
<v Speaker 1>protecting you from the fear of death.</v>

166
00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:45.443
<v Speaker 1>So there is the stabilization of society</v>
<v Speaker 1>aspect that that's a motivator for </v>

167
00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:55.390
<v Speaker 1>maintaining a set of shared beliefs </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it kind of makes us identical,</v>

168
00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:58.270
<v Speaker 1>which you might say is bad on the side </v>
<v Speaker 1>of individuality.</v>

169
00:11:58.271 --> 00:11:58.811
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

170
00:11:58.811 --> 00:11:59.440
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah.</v>

171
00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.273
<v Speaker 1>Individuality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really good on the side of not </v>

172
00:12:02.261 --> 00:12:03.094
<v Speaker 1>having to assume that the next person is</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to kill you and that's way more </v>

173
00:12:06.401 --> 00:12:07.870
<v Speaker 1>important than individuality.</v>

174
00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:09.263
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other thing I would like to make a </v>

175
00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:12.180
<v Speaker 1>case for briefly is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

176
00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:13.023
<v Speaker 1>in the West,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people think Western people are </v>

177
00:12:14.441 --> 00:12:17.320
<v Speaker 1>individualistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the stupidest theory ever.</v>

178
00:12:17.321 --> 00:12:19.990
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except for maybe the theory that poverty</v>

179
00:12:19.991 --> 00:12:22.480
<v Speaker 1>is at the root of all these social </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems that we see.</v>

180
00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:25.300
<v Speaker 1>Western people are hardly individual at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

181
00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:28.840
<v Speaker 1>All you have to do is go out and look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>traffic patterns to figure that out.</v>

182
00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:31.780
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody stops at a red light.</v>

183
00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:34.870
<v Speaker 1>Everybody crosses when the walk signal </v>
<v Speaker 1>turns,</v>

184
00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.810
<v Speaker 1>virtually everybody waits in line when </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

185
00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:38.673
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lineup for some restricted access </v>

186
00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:43.480
<v Speaker 1>event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all dress the same way.</v>

187
00:12:43.481 --> 00:12:45.220
<v Speaker 1>Men and women alike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

188
00:12:45.221 --> 00:12:47.830
<v Speaker 1>we follow the rules like mad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like crazy.</v>

189
00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:50.260
<v Speaker 1>And then on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a bit of fluff,</v>

190
00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:52.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the things we could do if we're</v>

191
00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:55.120
<v Speaker 1>free,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we can talk about and dream about,</v>

192
00:12:55.121 --> 00:12:58.060
<v Speaker 1>but which hardly in what he does and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what it looks like.</v>

193
00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:00.670
<v Speaker 1>Individuality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you get that freedom.</v>

194
00:13:00.671 --> 00:13:04.270
<v Speaker 1>But the cost of it is incredible </v>
<v Speaker 1>obedience and bought,</v>

195
00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:05.133
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact of the obedience is that while </v>

196
00:13:07.031 --> 00:13:08.470
<v Speaker 1>you could sit here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

197
00:13:08.471 --> 00:13:11.080
<v Speaker 1>and look at this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all safe and everything and you can</v>

198
00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.530
<v Speaker 1>come here with all these other weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>primates and you don't know a damn thing</v>

199
00:13:14.531 --> 00:13:15.364
<v Speaker 1>about them and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they come from all sorts of different </v>

200
00:13:17.741 --> 00:13:18.574
<v Speaker 1>places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a shared social structure </v>

201
00:13:20.531 --> 00:13:23.350
<v Speaker 1>and everybody participates in the game </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then all of a sudden,</v>

202
00:13:23.351 --> 00:13:24.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's basically safe.</v>

203
00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:27.550
<v Speaker 1>Fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one reason for conservatism,</v>

204
00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:28.893
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and for identification with the belief </v>

205
00:13:29.951 --> 00:13:32.680
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like stabilize the damn game.</v>

206
00:13:32.681 --> 00:13:33.514
<v Speaker 1>So you can predict the other primates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of people who talk about </v>

207
00:13:36.731 --> 00:13:37.564
<v Speaker 1>conservatism as a political belief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make the assumption that that control </v>

208
00:13:41.531 --> 00:13:44.560
<v Speaker 1>element is the fundamental motivator </v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

209
00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:46.713
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

210
00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:48.250
<v Speaker 1>for right wing political belief.</v>

211
00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:49.113
<v Speaker 1>But weirdly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other thing that happens when you </v>

212
00:13:53.921 --> 00:13:55.810
<v Speaker 1>stabilize a game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

213
00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:57.993
<v Speaker 1>which would be a shared belief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you provide a goal because a </v>

214
00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:03.700
<v Speaker 1>value system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a shared value system,</v>

215
00:14:03.701 --> 00:14:06.610
<v Speaker 1>is always oriented towards a goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise it's not a value system.</v>

216
00:14:06.611 --> 00:14:09.280
<v Speaker 1>It's not a belief system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is as soon as,</v>

217
00:14:09.281 --> 00:14:12.520
<v Speaker 1>and this is a psg Eddie and point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as you organize something around</v>

218
00:14:12.521 --> 00:14:13.354
<v Speaker 1>a goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you give people opportunity to do two </v>

219
00:14:16.001 --> 00:14:17.380
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

220
00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:21.070
<v Speaker 1>three things cooperate within the rural </v>
<v Speaker 1>framer,</v>

221
00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:22.113
<v Speaker 1>compete within the rural framework.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that brings into the possibility of </v>

222
00:14:25.121 --> 00:14:25.954
<v Speaker 1>victory and loss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also to experience some positive </v>

223
00:14:28.241 --> 00:14:30.490
<v Speaker 1>emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because like if,</v>

224
00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:31.443
<v Speaker 1>if we haven't unified our game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is basically the job of a bloody </v>

225
00:14:35.081 --> 00:14:37.930
<v Speaker 1>three year old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we haven't unified our game.</v>

226
00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:38.973
<v Speaker 1>And so we're each playing our own games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way that we can collectively </v>

227
00:14:42.971 --> 00:14:45.940
<v Speaker 1>aim at something and there's no way that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can progress,</v>

228
00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:46.330
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

229
00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:47.163
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that when when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're taught about the oppressive </v>

230
00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:53.300
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say of the patriarchal system,</v>

231
00:14:53.301 --> 00:14:54.134
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that's never noted is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that because that's a hierarchical </v>

232
00:14:57.411 --> 00:14:58.244
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also a preconditioned for any kind </v>

233
00:15:00.831 --> 00:15:01.664
<v Speaker 1>of victory and that would even be </v>
<v Speaker 1>victory over yourself if you want to be </v>

234
00:15:04.311 --> 00:15:09.260
<v Speaker 1>better tomorrow than you are today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically what you're doing is aiming at</v>

235
00:15:09.261 --> 00:15:10.094
<v Speaker 1>a point that's defined by the value </v>
<v Speaker 1>system so that saving up and trying to </v>

236
00:15:13.251 --> 00:15:16.920
<v Speaker 1>move yourself towards it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get rid of that shared value system,</v>

237
00:15:16.921 --> 00:15:20.330
<v Speaker 1>but there's no structure for positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion anymore.</v>

238
00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:22.123
<v Speaker 1>So part of the reason people want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stabilize their belief systems and so </v>

239
00:15:25.071 --> 00:15:27.290
<v Speaker 1>that the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly other people,</v>

240
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:28.183
<v Speaker 1>but also the environment remains under </v>
<v Speaker 1>control and thank God for that because </v>

241
00:15:31.431 --> 00:15:34.550
<v Speaker 1>otherwise it's just outright bloody </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos.</v>

242
00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:40.910
<v Speaker 1>But the other reason is</v>

243
00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:44.620
<v Speaker 1>no game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no winners,</v>

244
00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:46.910
<v Speaker 1>nothing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one.</v>

245
00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:48.093
<v Speaker 1>That's I think why there's an orthogonal</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship between agreeableness and </v>

246
00:15:51.731 --> 00:15:52.564
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conscientiousness seems to do something </v>

247
00:15:55.691 --> 00:15:59.410
<v Speaker 1>like stabilized rule structures across </v>
<v Speaker 1>long periods of time.</v>

248
00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:00.453
<v Speaker 1>So it kind of defines the game </v>
<v Speaker 1>explicitly and that lays out the </v>

249
00:16:03.431 --> 00:16:06.490
<v Speaker 1>possibility of a hierarchy and a value </v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

250
00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:08.080
<v Speaker 1>And then agreeable just says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

251
00:16:08.081 --> 00:16:09.940
<v Speaker 1>don't get too carried away with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

252
00:16:09.941 --> 00:16:10.774
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to make the game so damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>tight that the losers stack up at zero </v>

253
00:16:14.291 --> 00:16:16.210
<v Speaker 1>and die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

254
00:16:16.211 --> 00:16:19.660
<v Speaker 1>it's egalitarian isn't versus justice or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

255
00:16:19.661 --> 00:16:22.060
<v Speaker 1>That's not exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's something like that.</v>

256
00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:25.030
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody should go to university,</v>

257
00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:26.770
<v Speaker 1>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>egalitarian,</v>

258
00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:28.533
<v Speaker 1>presupposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people who work hard and study </v>

259
00:16:31.241 --> 00:16:32.074
<v Speaker 1>should do better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a presupposition of justice </v>

260
00:16:34.421 --> 00:16:35.980
<v Speaker 1>and those aren't the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

261
00:16:35.981 --> 00:16:36.814
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they work somewhat in opposition to one </v>

262
00:16:38.051 --> 00:16:38.710
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>

263
00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:39.543
<v Speaker 1>So you could say let everyone in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You enter university and fail half of </v>

264
00:16:42.701 --> 00:16:43.534
<v Speaker 1>them in the first year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's kind of what they do in </v>

265
00:16:45.041 --> 00:16:46.380
<v Speaker 1>places like Holland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

266
00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:49.330
<v Speaker 1>where we have fairly structured </v>
<v Speaker 1>admission criteria,</v>

267
00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:52.570
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see the tension there because if</v>

268
00:16:52.571 --> 00:16:53.404
<v Speaker 1>you let everybody into university then </v>
<v Speaker 1>the really smart people are being </v>

269
00:16:56.681 --> 00:16:57.514
<v Speaker 1>dragged for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're being put into a position where </v>

270
00:17:00.551 --> 00:17:04.270
<v Speaker 1>they're able to advance much more slowly</v>
<v Speaker 1>than they would otherwise.</v>

271
00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:08.170
<v Speaker 1>So that's a real price to pay at the top</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the distribution.</v>

272
00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:09.303
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're opening up opportunities for </v>

273
00:17:10.751 --> 00:17:11.584
<v Speaker 1>people who for one reason or another </v>
<v Speaker 1>might have not done well in high school </v>

274
00:17:14.351 --> 00:17:17.290
<v Speaker 1>or previously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but could actually thrive in university.</v>

275
00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:19.600
<v Speaker 1>But you see that those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

276
00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:21.490
<v Speaker 1>there's two values structures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are,</v>

277
00:17:21.491 --> 00:17:22.324
<v Speaker 1>it's not easy to optimize them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly why I think we have </v>

278
00:17:24.371 --> 00:17:25.204
<v Speaker 1>those two parallel personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensions and it's real hell when one </v>

279
00:17:27.731 --> 00:17:29.620
<v Speaker 1>of them gets the upper hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

280
00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:33.400
<v Speaker 1>part of it is balanced inclusion and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>

281
00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:35.740
<v Speaker 1>You need to have those things operating </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the same time.</v>

282
00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:37.263
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So back to the mythological </v>

283
00:17:44.811 --> 00:17:45.644
<v Speaker 1>representations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean partly what you see in </v>

284
00:17:47.181 --> 00:17:52.181
<v Speaker 1>mythological representations of reality </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we have to talk about reality at the</v>

285
00:17:52.471 --> 00:17:53.304
<v Speaker 1>have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the presence of something that </v>

286
00:17:56.341 --> 00:17:58.980
<v Speaker 1>represents the hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

287
00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:02.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fairy tales,</v>

288
00:18:02.791 --> 00:18:05.430
<v Speaker 1>that's often the cane wise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>king or otherwise.</v>

289
00:18:05.431 --> 00:18:06.264
<v Speaker 1>And then in religious mythology it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>usually something that represents the </v>

290
00:18:09.391 --> 00:18:10.224
<v Speaker 1>king or the father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's because the primary </v>

291
00:18:12.931 --> 00:18:17.580
<v Speaker 1>social hierarchies among human beings </v>
<v Speaker 1>are masculine in nature.</v>

292
00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:23.570
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's probably because </v>
<v Speaker 1>while men are more like pack animals and</v>

293
00:18:25.471 --> 00:18:27.270
<v Speaker 1>why aren't women?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

294
00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:32.550
<v Speaker 1>I think the reason for that is is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that men did historically had</v>

295
00:18:32.551 --> 00:18:33.384
<v Speaker 1>a communal element,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a goal directed communal element </v>

296
00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:36.893
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't as prevalent in female </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchies if something like </v>

297
00:18:40.771 --> 00:18:45.771
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a representation of that,</v>

298
00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:49.623
<v Speaker 1>of the hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then there's a counter </v>

299
00:18:51.551 --> 00:18:52.384
<v Speaker 1>representation which is a representation</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the individual and that's another </v>

300
00:18:56.290 --> 00:18:58.930
<v Speaker 1>really tight melons that societies have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to manage.</v>

301
00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:04.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't want you to be too different </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you're too different,</v>

302
00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:06.993
<v Speaker 1>I can't predict you and you may actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a threat to the integrity of the </v>

303
00:19:10.801 --> 00:19:14.010
<v Speaker 1>society because you might come up with </v>
<v Speaker 1>something so wild and so on.</v>

304
00:19:14.011 --> 00:19:17.440
<v Speaker 1>Unconstrained that it just blows the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire game into pieces.</v>

305
00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:18.760
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>

306
00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:22.840
<v Speaker 1>to the degree that I'm a rigid </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>

307
00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:23.913
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to fall behind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As the environment transforms and the </v>

308
00:19:26.561 --> 00:19:28.000
<v Speaker 1>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the natural environment,</v>

309
00:19:28.001 --> 00:19:28.834
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the environment outside of the </v>

310
00:19:29.501 --> 00:19:31.600
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy is also something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's stable.</v>

311
00:19:31.601 --> 00:19:32.434
<v Speaker 1>He represented mythologies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things you see happening </v>

312
00:19:34.841 --> 00:19:35.674
<v Speaker 1>is there's a hierarchy and the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing is there's a force outside the </v>

313
00:19:39.311 --> 00:19:41.920
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy and it's often represented by </v>
<v Speaker 1>an eye.</v>

314
00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:43.353
<v Speaker 1>So you see this in a variety of ancient </v>
<v Speaker 1>myths and that represents the capacity </v>

315
00:19:46.841 --> 00:19:47.674
<v Speaker 1>of the individual to pay attention and </v>
<v Speaker 1>to maintain and update the hierarchy so </v>

316
00:19:51.791 --> 00:19:54.520
<v Speaker 1>you have this dance between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual and the hierarchy,</v>

317
00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:55.753
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy structures of the individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>and disciplines them and produces a </v>

318
00:19:59.961 --> 00:20:00.794
<v Speaker 1>culture being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then hopefully the culture being </v>

319
00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:07.000
<v Speaker 1>kind of pops up above the hierarchy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then can start,</v>

320
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:08.263
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>altering it hopefully relatively </v>

321
00:20:10.991 --> 00:20:12.850
<v Speaker 1>minimally where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's necessary.</v>

322
00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:13.683
<v Speaker 1>It's very much akin to piaget's idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>that once children hit higher levels of </v>

323
00:20:18.131 --> 00:20:19.690
<v Speaker 1>moral development,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

324
00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:21.640
<v Speaker 1>they play alone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they can play with others,</v>

325
00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:22.533
<v Speaker 1>then they know the rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then morality is following the </v>

326
00:20:25.061 --> 00:20:26.980
<v Speaker 1>rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now after that I didn't.</v>

327
00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:30.550
<v Speaker 1>And not every child gets to this point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least according to Piaget,</v>

328
00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:31.893
<v Speaker 1>the child starts to regard him or her </v>
<v Speaker 1>self as something that can make the </v>

329
00:20:35.231 --> 00:20:36.850
<v Speaker 1>rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

330
00:20:36.851 --> 00:20:37.684
<v Speaker 1>So you could think about that as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Piaget did is the pinnacle of ethical </v>

331
00:20:40.961 --> 00:20:41.794
<v Speaker 1>development and whether or not that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the pinnacle is debatable because I </v>

332
00:20:46.361 --> 00:20:49.780
<v Speaker 1>think you'll see young extended that </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>

333
00:20:49.781 --> 00:20:53.260
<v Speaker 1>Although people never think about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a variation on Piagetian theory.</v>

334
00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:58.800
<v Speaker 1>So for Piaget,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you hit individual status,</v>

335
00:20:59.201 --> 00:21:02.650
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of you pop out of the group </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you hit individual status.</v>

336
00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:03.723
<v Speaker 1>It's not like you're a rule breaker </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can follow the rules and </v>

337
00:21:06.071 --> 00:21:09.610
<v Speaker 1>usually do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can observe them and modify them</v>

338
00:21:09.611 --> 00:21:10.444
<v Speaker 1>when necessary.</v>

339
00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:11.553
<v Speaker 1>It's almost exactly what your </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness does to your own internal </v>

340
00:21:14.501 --> 00:21:16.450
<v Speaker 1>neural structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

341
00:21:16.451 --> 00:21:18.660
<v Speaker 1>imagine you're playing a piano,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

342
00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:19.513
<v Speaker 1>and you've automatized most of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you've built little machines in the </v>

343
00:21:21.491 --> 00:21:24.550
<v Speaker 1>back of your head to take care of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the trills,</v>

344
00:21:24.551 --> 00:21:29.551
<v Speaker 1>let's say in the Arpeggios and you make </v>
<v Speaker 1>a mistake or your consciousness picks up</v>

345
00:21:29.831 --> 00:21:30.664
<v Speaker 1>the mistake and then you slow down what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing and observe yourself for </v>

346
00:21:35.171 --> 00:21:37.570
<v Speaker 1>the motor errors and then you correct </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

347
00:21:37.571 --> 00:21:38.404
<v Speaker 1>which is difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you practice and practice and </v>

348
00:21:39.701 --> 00:21:40.534
<v Speaker 1>practice and practice and practice and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you automate the new routine and then </v>

349
00:21:43.481 --> 00:21:44.314
<v Speaker 1>you go on and so what consciousness is </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing is watching output and when </v>

350
00:21:47.441 --> 00:21:51.340
<v Speaker 1>there's a mismatch between what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>aiming at and what happens,</v>

351
00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:53.680
<v Speaker 1>you stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's basically anxiety.</v>

352
00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:58.090
<v Speaker 1>You make your error correction and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>fixes the hierarchy and then you go on,</v>

353
00:21:58.091 --> 00:22:01.360
<v Speaker 1>well that's really the relationship of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the individual to society as well.</v>

354
00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:02.793
<v Speaker 1>Now you push that idea a fair bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>further and I might as well tell you </v>

355
00:22:07.211 --> 00:22:09.130
<v Speaker 1>about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We never discussed this in our,</v>

356
00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:11.680
<v Speaker 1>in our section on Yom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's pretty interesting.</v>

357
00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:15.130
<v Speaker 1>See if I can get this right.</v>

358
00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:23.230
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So young basically presumed,</v>

359
00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:24.073
<v Speaker 1>presumed that as you were socialized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you developed that persona and the </v>

360
00:22:28.761 --> 00:22:33.080
<v Speaker 1>persona was you in so far as you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>socialized,</v>

361
00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:35.870
<v Speaker 1>now you can see persona,</v>
<v Speaker 1>persona.</v>

362
00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:40.790
<v Speaker 1>When you listen to someone who's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very concerned with their appearance and</v>

363
00:22:40.791 --> 00:22:41.624
<v Speaker 1>whose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whose speech is somewhat false as a </v>

364
00:22:43.641 --> 00:22:45.500
<v Speaker 1>consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

365
00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:48.680
<v Speaker 1>so they don't seem genuine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They seem to polished,</v>

366
00:22:48.681 --> 00:22:49.940
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or something like that.</v>

367
00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:51.410
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not a lot of emotion,</v>

368
00:22:51.411 --> 00:22:52.910
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in their speech,</v>

369
00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:56.930
<v Speaker 1>they're very self contained and </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned with their public appearance,</v>

370
00:22:56.931 --> 00:23:01.240
<v Speaker 1>which it seems also to be a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>desirable consequences.</v>

371
00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:05.610
<v Speaker 1>Spending too much time in social media </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's all persona development,</v>

372
00:23:05.611 --> 00:23:06.860
<v Speaker 1>tate's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

373
00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:07.923
<v Speaker 1>It's not necessarily a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does seem to be associated with </v>

374
00:23:10.071 --> 00:23:15.020
<v Speaker 1>higher rates of depression anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your,</v>

375
00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:20.290
<v Speaker 1>your persona is you as socialized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being so young would say,</v>

376
00:23:21.021 --> 00:23:25.070
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously you can be socialized and what</v>

377
00:23:25.071 --> 00:23:28.550
<v Speaker 1>that means is some of you is invited out</v>
<v Speaker 1>to play and to develop,</v>

378
00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:32.720
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of years left on </v>
<v Speaker 1>differentiated or even forbidden.</v>

379
00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:34.100
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

380
00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:36.473
<v Speaker 1>this happens with agreeable people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Agreeable people think aggression is </v>

381
00:23:39.151 --> 00:23:39.984
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's not very useful because </v>

382
00:23:42.241 --> 00:23:43.074
<v Speaker 1>first of all it's not wrong and second </v>
<v Speaker 1>of all because they have the for </v>

383
00:23:45.741 --> 00:23:48.980
<v Speaker 1>aggression and so if that isn't brought </v>
<v Speaker 1>out to play,</v>

384
00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:53.630
<v Speaker 1>it sits at home and it's closet and gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>all war advanced and only comes out,</v>

385
00:23:53.631 --> 00:23:55.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at night to cause trouble.</v>

386
00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:58.280
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things you would say </v>
<v Speaker 1>as well,</v>

387
00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:01.640
<v Speaker 1>this is part of the exploration of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shadow,</v>

388
00:24:01.641 --> 00:24:02.474
<v Speaker 1>is there's going to be us persona and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's this mishmash of </v>

389
00:24:05.481 --> 00:24:08.180
<v Speaker 1>undeveloped and resentful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

390
00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:09.853
<v Speaker 1>potential roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your job is to transmute your moral </v>

391
00:24:15.111 --> 00:24:19.670
<v Speaker 1>system and integrate all that stuff that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was rejected into your personality.</v>

392
00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:23.960
<v Speaker 1>And that's often involves a descent into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the underworld and a rebirth.</v>

393
00:24:23.961 --> 00:24:28.640
<v Speaker 1>And that's another mythological motif.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So his idea was</v>

394
00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:38.970
<v Speaker 1>you can think about it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Piaget said</v>

395
00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:41.363
<v Speaker 1>at the last step of moral development,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you view yourself as someone who could </v>

396
00:24:45.031 --> 00:24:47.970
<v Speaker 1>alter the rules and young would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

397
00:24:47.971 --> 00:24:52.170
<v Speaker 1>there's another point in that not only </v>
<v Speaker 1>do you alter the rules,</v>

398
00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:53.183
<v Speaker 1>you alter them so that you can include </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that were denied or forbidden by </v>

399
00:24:57.691 --> 00:25:02.010
<v Speaker 1>the previous system of rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a more inclusive game.</v>

400
00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:06.990
<v Speaker 1>And part of what it includes is those </v>
<v Speaker 1>parts of you that you'd cast off because</v>

401
00:25:06.991 --> 00:25:07.824
<v Speaker 1>they were socially inappropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So and often you'll Freud's comment </v>

402
00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:16.050
<v Speaker 1>about that sort of thing was that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>often sexuality and aggression,</v>

403
00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:19.650
<v Speaker 1>partly because those are kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual in nature and they're kind of</v>

404
00:25:19.651 --> 00:25:23.370
<v Speaker 1>harder to integrate into a social group </v>
<v Speaker 1>and people will take offense to them.</v>

405
00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:24.233
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look what's happening on college </v>

406
00:25:25.291 --> 00:25:26.124
<v Speaker 1>campuses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Universities are spending more time </v>

407
00:25:27.871 --> 00:25:29.610
<v Speaker 1>worrying about sexual assault.</v>

408
00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:30.653
<v Speaker 1>Then they are worrying about education </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason for that is it's the </v>

409
00:25:34.471 --> 00:25:35.304
<v Speaker 1>reason we're just describing is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexuality and aggression are very hard </v>

410
00:25:38.761 --> 00:25:41.520
<v Speaker 1>to integrate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they remain on outside.</v>

411
00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:44.460
<v Speaker 1>Now you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suppress it for Christ's sake.</v>

412
00:25:44.461 --> 00:25:45.294
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gate your sexuality under control and </v>

413
00:25:47.370 --> 00:25:48.203
<v Speaker 1>eradicate your aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a stupid idea because we know </v>

414
00:25:51.121 --> 00:25:53.430
<v Speaker 1>what happens when you do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

415
00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:54.353
<v Speaker 1>you turn into a little milk saw he sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of creature with a tremendous amount of </v>

416
00:25:58.471 --> 00:26:01.710
<v Speaker 1>resentment and then you sporadically </v>
<v Speaker 1>explode that hardly.</v>

417
00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:05.550
<v Speaker 1>Plus you're denying yourself immense </v>
<v Speaker 1>depth in your personality.</v>

418
00:26:06.010 --> 00:26:06.843
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a person who has repressed their </v>

419
00:26:08.641 --> 00:26:09.474
<v Speaker 1>aggression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their sexuality generally is just dull </v>

420
00:26:11.551 --> 00:26:14.400
<v Speaker 1>as you can possibly imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't even want to talk to them.</v>

421
00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:18.500
<v Speaker 1>Whereas someone who has that integrated </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are far more interesting,</v>

422
00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:19.343
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there is a provocative element </v>

423
00:26:20.701 --> 00:26:23.310
<v Speaker 1>and the teasing element and a dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 1>element and,</v>

424
00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:24.373
<v Speaker 1>and a colorful element and all of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that make social interactions </v>

425
00:26:28.051 --> 00:26:28.980
<v Speaker 1>much more interesting.</v>

426
00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:30.270
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

427
00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:31.523
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're playing with fire at that point </v>

428
00:26:34.561 --> 00:26:37.590
<v Speaker 1>in your personality development,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but human beings are born into play with</v>

429
00:26:37.591 --> 00:26:40.530
<v Speaker 1>fire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you don't want to deny yourself that.</v>

430
00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:41.633
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so young's idea of continued moral </v>

431
00:26:44.221 --> 00:26:45.054
<v Speaker 1>development was know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold the oppressed self out of </v>

432
00:26:47.701 --> 00:26:49.320
<v Speaker 1>captivity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

433
00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:52.410
<v Speaker 1>Notice what you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

434
00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:57.090
<v Speaker 1>partly to refuse to take responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also partly just to tame yourself so</v>

435
00:26:57.091 --> 00:27:01.470
<v Speaker 1>that you're at least not annoying and </v>
<v Speaker 1>get that other stuff up into the game.</v>

436
00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:05.070
<v Speaker 1>So he would think of that at least in </v>
<v Speaker 1>part as the union of the,</v>

437
00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:09.090
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Union of the articulated itself with</v>

438
00:27:09.091 --> 00:27:09.924
<v Speaker 1>the unarticulated itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of which would be grounded in </v>

439
00:27:12.391 --> 00:27:15.660
<v Speaker 1>emotion and motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So okay,</v>

440
00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:16.763
<v Speaker 1>so that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thought of that as a conjunction </v>

441
00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:19.493
<v Speaker 1>conjunction number one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the bringing together of </v>

442
00:27:22.351 --> 00:27:27.351
<v Speaker 1>spirit and soul or or articulated self </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the end,</v>

443
00:27:27.961 --> 00:27:29.940
<v Speaker 1>articulate itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

444
00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:33.840
<v Speaker 1>So now you're an organized from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective of your psyche,</v>

445
00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:35.033
<v Speaker 1>but then there's another staff and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>now you think of that as an organized </v>

446
00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:38.363
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next step is to integrate that with </v>

447
00:27:41.431 --> 00:27:42.264
<v Speaker 1>your body and that basically means not </v>
<v Speaker 1>only to have that integrated state of </v>

448
00:27:47.701 --> 00:27:50.340
<v Speaker 1>being as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>

449
00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:54.480
<v Speaker 1>as a belief system and and system of </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation,</v>

450
00:27:54.481 --> 00:27:55.314
<v Speaker 1>that perception,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also to act it out in the world </v>

451
00:27:57.690 --> 00:28:00.810
<v Speaker 1>because it's one thing to know </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

452
00:28:00.811 --> 00:28:03.510
<v Speaker 1>it's another thing to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you really know it,</v>

453
00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:05.700
<v Speaker 1>there's no difference between knowing it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and doing it.</v>

454
00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:07.760
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then your body and your,</v>

455
00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:12.660
<v Speaker 1>your mind and your body are unified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's a third step after that</v>

456
00:28:12.661 --> 00:28:13.494
<v Speaker 1>which is really quite complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is where you start to shade </v>

457
00:28:16.771 --> 00:28:20.360
<v Speaker 1>into phenomenological perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

458
00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:22.080
<v Speaker 1>when we were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenology,</v>

459
00:28:22.081 --> 00:28:25.530
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I pointed out was that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the phenomenologists are,</v>

460
00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:26.473
<v Speaker 1>they're playing a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could say they're playing a complex </v>

461
00:28:29.101 --> 00:28:32.300
<v Speaker 1>philosophical game and the game is what </v>
<v Speaker 1>if that.</v>

462
00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:33.143
<v Speaker 1>What if is okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forget about the idea of subjective and </v>

463
00:28:35.671 --> 00:28:37.920
<v Speaker 1>objective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just forget about it for a moment.</v>

464
00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:38.783
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll start with a new set of </v>

465
00:28:39.721 --> 00:28:40.554
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The presuppositions are that everything </v>

466
00:28:43.831 --> 00:28:48.510
<v Speaker 1>you experience is real and everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>you experience is you.</v>

467
00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:53.040
<v Speaker 1>So you say reality is experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's an implication to that.</v>

468
00:28:53.041 --> 00:28:58.041
<v Speaker 1>And the implication is that in so far as</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're part of my experience,</v>

469
00:28:58.650 --> 00:28:59.483
<v Speaker 1>the separation between us is illusory </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the next stage that young </v>

470
00:29:03.871 --> 00:29:04.704
<v Speaker 1>proposed was that the integrated itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>eliminates the distinction between self </v>

471
00:29:10.441 --> 00:29:12.870
<v Speaker 1>and other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that would be.</v>

472
00:29:13.650 --> 00:29:15.580
<v Speaker 1>That would be recognition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

473
00:29:15.581 --> 00:29:16.414
<v Speaker 1>and everyone already knows this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's pretty hard for me to be </v>

474
00:29:18.421 --> 00:29:22.910
<v Speaker 1>stable and happy if I see you miserable </v>
<v Speaker 1>and suffering well,</v>

475
00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:24.060
<v Speaker 1>why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

476
00:29:24.061 --> 00:29:26.850
<v Speaker 1>it's because in so far as I encountered </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

477
00:29:26.851 --> 00:29:30.840
<v Speaker 1>at least your misery and suffering is my</v>
<v Speaker 1>misery and suffering.</v>

478
00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:32.460
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless I'm psychopathic.</v>

479
00:29:32.461 --> 00:29:33.294
<v Speaker 1>To the nth degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the idea that and that has to be </v>

480
00:29:36.571 --> 00:29:37.404
<v Speaker 1>taken care of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well and you certainly see this in the </v>

481
00:29:38.911 --> 00:29:39.744
<v Speaker 1>realm of the family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know if you're in a family and one </v>

482
00:29:41.861 --> 00:29:42.694
<v Speaker 1>of your family members is you know not </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing well in a manner they can't help </v>

483
00:29:48.191 --> 00:29:49.024
<v Speaker 1>or not doing well in a manner that can </v>
<v Speaker 1>help the probability that that's going </v>

484
00:29:52.121 --> 00:29:57.121
<v Speaker 1>to have a direct bearing on your quality</v>
<v Speaker 1>of being is 100 percent.</v>

485
00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:59.890
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be the prime determinant and so</v>

486
00:29:59.891 --> 00:30:04.180
<v Speaker 1>then you can seriously ask yourself what</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes you think you're separate?</v>

487
00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:08.450
<v Speaker 1>And you know a phenomenologist would </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

488
00:30:08.451 --> 00:30:11.780
<v Speaker 1>well that's your assumption that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>subject object divide is absolute.</v>

489
00:30:11.781 --> 00:30:13.190
<v Speaker 1>That's what makes you think you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>separate.</v>

490
00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:18.170
<v Speaker 1>And so the final step,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of akin to a Dostoevsky idea.</v>

491
00:30:18.171 --> 00:30:19.004
<v Speaker 1>Dostoevsky positive in one of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird sort of transcendent moments that </v>

492
00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:28.040
<v Speaker 1>everything that happened to you was not </v>
<v Speaker 1>only your fault,</v>

493
00:30:28.041 --> 00:30:28.874
<v Speaker 1>but everything that happened to everyone</v>
<v Speaker 1>was your fault and he didn't mean it </v>

494
00:30:32.451 --> 00:30:33.284
<v Speaker 1>precisely like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He meant it more like everything that </v>

495
00:30:36.711 --> 00:30:37.544
<v Speaker 1>happens to you is your responsibility </v>
<v Speaker 1>and everything that happens to everyone </v>

496
00:30:40.671 --> 00:30:44.210
<v Speaker 1>else is also your responsibility know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's it.</v>

497
00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:46.733
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an insane claim to some degree </v>

498
00:30:48.211 --> 00:30:53.211
<v Speaker 1>because it broadens the realm of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility out to unlimited reach,</v>

499
00:30:53.281 --> 00:30:54.114
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but life isn't insane thing and so </v>

500
00:30:58.181 --> 00:31:00.640
<v Speaker 1>there's no reason to assume that just </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of that,</v>

501
00:31:00.790 --> 00:31:01.623
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seems exaggerated to the point if your </v>

502
00:31:03.831 --> 00:31:04.664
<v Speaker 1>rationality that it's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of things about life that </v>

503
00:31:07.751 --> 00:31:09.950
<v Speaker 1>are exaggerated to the point of </v>
<v Speaker 1>irrationality,</v>

504
00:31:10.450 --> 00:31:13.660
<v Speaker 1>like the fundamental structure of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Israel is irrational.</v>

505
00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:16.060
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're born arbitrarily.</v>

506
00:31:16.061 --> 00:31:18.370
<v Speaker 1>There you are in your particular time </v>
<v Speaker 1>and place.</v>

507
00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:20.133
<v Speaker 1>You live in accordance with your talents</v>
<v Speaker 1>and limitations and then at the end of </v>

508
00:31:22.721 --> 00:31:24.280
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no you anymore.</v>

509
00:31:24.281 --> 00:31:25.120
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

510
00:31:25.121 --> 00:31:25.954
<v Speaker 1>good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make an act rational like it's </v>

511
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.710
<v Speaker 1>intrinsically irrational.</v>

512
00:31:31.930 --> 00:31:32.763
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in one of the things that really </v>

513
00:31:33.671 --> 00:31:34.504
<v Speaker 1>advanced theories of human development </v>
<v Speaker 1>posit is that to answer in irrational </v>

514
00:31:38.711 --> 00:31:39.544
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need an irrational answer and I </v>

515
00:31:43.031 --> 00:31:44.770
<v Speaker 1>think that's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

516
00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:46.930
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if life is an impossible burden,</v>

517
00:31:46.931 --> 00:31:47.764
<v Speaker 1>which is clearly the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you need an impossible goal to set </v>

518
00:31:52.421 --> 00:31:56.170
<v Speaker 1>against it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to justify it and part of that might be,</v>

519
00:31:56.171 --> 00:31:57.004
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

520
00:31:57.190 --> 00:32:00.370
<v Speaker 1>get your act together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>improve the quality of being around you,</v>

521
00:32:00.371 --> 00:32:02.630
<v Speaker 1>but then that starts to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

522
00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:06.010
<v Speaker 1>stretch its tentacles out to include </v>
<v Speaker 1>more and more people.</v>

523
00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:07.800
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

524
00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:10.780
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I've thought about for</v>
<v Speaker 1>a long time is</v>

525
00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:16.260
<v Speaker 1>there's this proclivity of people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>flee into,</v>

526
00:32:16.261 --> 00:32:20.550
<v Speaker 1>let's say nihilism for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for every good reason under the books or</v>

527
00:32:20.551 --> 00:32:21.384
<v Speaker 1>ideological possession and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>alternative to those two things you </v>

528
00:32:24.811 --> 00:32:27.390
<v Speaker 1>might think of as chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

529
00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:30.210
<v Speaker 1>Well nihilism is sort of a form of chaos</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>

530
00:32:30.510 --> 00:32:31.343
<v Speaker 1>It's not surprising that people become </v>
<v Speaker 1>nihilistic plus it's easy and it's not </v>

531
00:32:34.951 --> 00:32:37.440
<v Speaker 1>surprising that they become </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideologically possessed.</v>

532
00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:40.040
<v Speaker 1>Plus it's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>

533
00:32:40.041 --> 00:32:42.050
<v Speaker 1>is there any reasonable alternative to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

534
00:32:42.051 --> 00:32:42.340
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

535
00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:43.173
<v Speaker 1>if you read people like Ernest Becker </v>
<v Speaker 1>who wrote a book called the denial of </v>

536
00:32:45.741 --> 00:32:46.574
<v Speaker 1>death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a hyper Friday and really his </v>

537
00:32:48.651 --> 00:32:49.484
<v Speaker 1>whole hypothesis like the terror </v>
<v Speaker 1>management theorists who derive their </v>

538
00:32:52.161 --> 00:32:52.994
<v Speaker 1>ideas from becker by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that everything people do is </v>

539
00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:57.380
<v Speaker 1>illusory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

540
00:32:57.381 --> 00:32:59.150
<v Speaker 1>no matter what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an illusion.</v>

541
00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:00.853
<v Speaker 1>And so the fundamental underlying </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality of human life is that it's </v>

542
00:33:03.591 --> 00:33:04.424
<v Speaker 1>hopeless.</v>

543
00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:06.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

544
00:33:06.111 --> 00:33:08.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a hell of a conclusion to draw.</v>

545
00:33:08.181 --> 00:33:09.014
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's clearly the wrong </v>

546
00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:12.133
<v Speaker 1>conclusion because it leads to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it leads to places you just do not want </v>

547
00:33:16.101 --> 00:33:16.934
<v Speaker 1>to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for me that's enough evidence that </v>

548
00:33:18.561 --> 00:33:20.060
<v Speaker 1>there's something wrong with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

549
00:33:20.061 --> 00:33:23.660
<v Speaker 1>like if you're following a path and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>leads to Auschwitz,</v>

550
00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:24.740
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

551
00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:27.830
<v Speaker 1>there's something wrong with that path.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>

552
00:33:27.831 --> 00:33:30.230
<v Speaker 1>well the whole paths are equally absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

553
00:33:30.231 --> 00:33:31.790
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

554
00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:33.800
<v Speaker 1>But some of them really hurt and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

555
00:33:33.801 --> 00:33:37.050
<v Speaker 1>maybe we could do without those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's a very different,</v>

556
00:33:37.051 --> 00:33:39.730
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to dispute that as </v>
<v Speaker 1>far.</v>

557
00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:40.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

558
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.020
<v Speaker 1>but what you have to say then is all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pain and suffering in the world.</v>

559
00:33:45.021 --> 00:33:46.040
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

560
00:33:46.041 --> 00:33:46.874
<v Speaker 1>along with all the good stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can make that irrelevant right away </v>

561
00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:53.150
<v Speaker 1>just by doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're really going to take the next</v>

562
00:33:53.151 --> 00:33:55.460
<v Speaker 1>step and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

563
00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:56.473
<v Speaker 1>all that human induced unnecessary pain </v>
<v Speaker 1>and suffering is actually meaningless </v>

564
00:34:01.581 --> 00:34:02.414
<v Speaker 1>and irrelevant.</v>

565
00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:03.380
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

566
00:34:03.381 --> 00:34:06.270
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put that person in jail now you know,</v>

567
00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:08.540
<v Speaker 1>before they do something really </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous,</v>

568
00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:10.650
<v Speaker 1>while I don't really mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you get,</v>

569
00:34:10.651 --> 00:34:14.450
<v Speaker 1>you get the point is that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you draw a conclusion like that,</v>

570
00:34:14.451 --> 00:34:16.700
<v Speaker 1>which is a logical conclusion of </v>
<v Speaker 1>nihilism.</v>

571
00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:18.920
<v Speaker 1>You draw a conclusion like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like all,</v>

572
00:34:18.970 --> 00:34:19.803
<v Speaker 1>all bets are off for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's something that just seems to </v>

573
00:34:22.851 --> 00:34:24.740
<v Speaker 1>be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just seems wrong.</v>

574
00:34:24.741 --> 00:34:25.574
<v Speaker 1>That conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then one of the things you might </v>

575
00:34:28.731 --> 00:34:29.600
<v Speaker 1>ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's okay,</v>

576
00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:32.420
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't seem very good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the opposite of that?</v>

577
00:34:32.421 --> 00:34:35.420
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that I've really </v>
<v Speaker 1>been trying to figure out is what is the</v>

578
00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:38.180
<v Speaker 1>opposite of the path that leads to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Auschwitz?</v>

579
00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:39.313
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once we can agree that that's a bad </v>

580
00:34:40.401 --> 00:34:41.151
<v Speaker 1>path.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

581
00:34:41.151 --> 00:34:41.984
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got a bad identified that implies </v>

582
00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:45.920
<v Speaker 1>the reverse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good Path.</v>

583
00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:47.810
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't define it though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

584
00:34:47.870 --> 00:34:48.703
<v Speaker 1>It just implies it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the implication would be whatever is </v>

585
00:34:52.461 --> 00:34:56.180
<v Speaker 1>least likely to lead you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is defacto good,</v>

586
00:34:56.181 --> 00:34:57.014
<v Speaker 1>or at least you could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've basically identified the </v>

587
00:34:59.151 --> 00:34:59.984
<v Speaker 1>territory and it seems to me that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposite of not caring about anyone and </v>

588
00:35:05.631 --> 00:35:09.590
<v Speaker 1>wishing perhaps for their painful </v>
<v Speaker 1>destruction is something like caring for</v>

589
00:35:09.591 --> 00:35:13.400
<v Speaker 1>everyone and wishing for their universal</v>
<v Speaker 1>betterment,</v>

590
00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:14.593
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that seems to me to be associated </v>

591
00:35:17.181 --> 00:35:18.014
<v Speaker 1>with the idea of improving being itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that means yours and your families </v>

592
00:35:23.241 --> 00:35:24.074
<v Speaker 1>and your communities and far out as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can reach probably starting with the </v>

593
00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:28.940
<v Speaker 1>local,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

594
00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:29.803
<v Speaker 1>until you get yourself all practice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that seems to be to be an </v>

595
00:35:34.311 --> 00:35:39.311
<v Speaker 1>impossible aim in some sense and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually a good thing because the,</v>

596
00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:42.713
<v Speaker 1>the psychological consequences of </v>
<v Speaker 1>pursuing an impossibly good goal are </v>

597
00:35:48.091 --> 00:35:48.924
<v Speaker 1>that everything you do starts to become </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningful because it's related </v>

598
00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:53.910
<v Speaker 1>intelligibly to that goal.</v>

599
00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:59.240
<v Speaker 1>And you have a structure within which </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can grapple with uncertainty,</v>

600
00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:01.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if someone says,</v>

601
00:36:01.591 --> 00:36:04.800
<v Speaker 1>well even you says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well why do you bother with that?</v>

602
00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:06.150
<v Speaker 1>You can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

603
00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:08.610
<v Speaker 1>because of this and this and this and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this and this and this,</v>

604
00:36:08.611 --> 00:36:09.444
<v Speaker 1>and then it leads down to Auschwitz and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're not going there and that's why </v>

605
00:36:12.571 --> 00:36:14.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a,</v>

606
00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:18.150
<v Speaker 1>that's a hell of a tough argument to </v>
<v Speaker 1>argue yourself out of.</v>

607
00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:18.993
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you really need in </v>

608
00:36:19.831 --> 00:36:24.690
<v Speaker 1>life is an argument for life that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>cannot dispute,</v>

609
00:36:25.830 --> 00:36:26.663
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise you're playing like </v>

610
00:36:27.541 --> 00:36:32.190
<v Speaker 1>the existentialists would say with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>constant recurrence of existential doubt</v>

611
00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:35.790
<v Speaker 1>and that paralyzes us and cripples you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it makes you weak.</v>

612
00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:38.970
<v Speaker 1>And so and worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

613
00:36:38.990 --> 00:36:40.170
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it works.</v>

614
00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:41.213
<v Speaker 1>You can end up with so much self </v>
<v Speaker 1>contempt just because of who you are as </v>

615
00:36:45.151 --> 00:36:49.200
<v Speaker 1>a creature that you're unconsciously </v>
<v Speaker 1>wishing for.</v>

616
00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:50.760
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolute denial.</v>

617
00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:54.600
<v Speaker 1>I see this in many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many places,</v>

618
00:36:54.601 --> 00:36:59.580
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things I've seen it most </v>
<v Speaker 1>frequently probably in the last 30 years</v>

619
00:36:59.581 --> 00:37:00.414
<v Speaker 1>is the insistence on the part of certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain parties who are at least in </v>

620
00:37:07.341 --> 00:37:09.860
<v Speaker 1>principle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned with environmental issues that</v>

621
00:37:09.861 --> 00:37:12.440
<v Speaker 1>the planet would be better off with no </v>
<v Speaker 1>people on it.</v>

622
00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:13.743
<v Speaker 1>It's like I think,</v>

623
00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:19.530
<v Speaker 1>well the first thing I think is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well let's start with you,</v>

624
00:37:20.110 --> 00:37:23.150
<v Speaker 1>but the next thing I think is really </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really what you think.</v>

625
00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:24.271
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

626
00:37:24.271 --> 00:37:25.104
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

627
00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:26.083
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to go very far down from </v>
<v Speaker 1>a psychoanalytic perspective into the </v>

628
00:37:29.551 --> 00:37:30.384
<v Speaker 1>dream underlying a statement like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>before you see that it is a sort of </v>

629
00:37:34.441 --> 00:37:35.274
<v Speaker 1>dream that you did not want to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything at all to do with because </v>

630
00:37:39.001 --> 00:37:39.834
<v Speaker 1>there's an actively genocidal component </v>
<v Speaker 1>to it and it's based in loading of </v>

631
00:37:43.741 --> 00:37:45.240
<v Speaker 1>humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>self-loathing,</v>

632
00:37:45.241 --> 00:37:47.430
<v Speaker 1>but also low thing on the entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>species.</v>

633
00:37:47.431 --> 00:37:48.264
<v Speaker 1>It's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>better be aware of that sort of </v>

634
00:37:50.881 --> 00:37:52.920
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not to say that,</v>

635
00:37:52.921 --> 00:37:53.754
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't have some things that we could </v>

636
00:37:54.511 --> 00:37:55.440
<v Speaker 1>clean up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

637
00:37:55.441 --> 00:37:59.400
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little sympathy for humanity wouldn't be</v>

638
00:37:59.401 --> 00:38:00.234
<v Speaker 1>a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do have a relatively hard time of it </v>

639
00:38:02.401 --> 00:38:03.234
<v Speaker 1>after all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is also something the </v>

640
00:38:04.171 --> 00:38:05.380
<v Speaker 1>existentialists know.</v>

641
00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:07.590
<v Speaker 1>They're nice corrective to freud because</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud says,</v>

642
00:38:07.591 --> 00:38:09.510
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're probably healthy unless something</v>

643
00:38:09.511 --> 00:38:11.480
<v Speaker 1>terrible has happened to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

644
00:38:11.481 --> 00:38:13.470
<v Speaker 1>and the existentialists called alarm </v>
<v Speaker 1>come along and say,</v>

645
00:38:13.471 --> 00:38:14.304
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but something terrible happens to </v>

646
00:38:15.301 --> 00:38:16.890
<v Speaker 1>everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

647
00:38:16.891 --> 00:38:21.090
<v Speaker 1>existence itself is sufficient cause for</v>
<v Speaker 1>human insanity.</v>

648
00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:24.330
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I basically by that I think everyone has</v>

649
00:38:24.331 --> 00:38:28.230
<v Speaker 1>an impossible existential and moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>burden.</v>

650
00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:31.680
<v Speaker 1>It's a condition of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

651
00:38:32.250 --> 00:38:34.710
<v Speaker 1>so when you see a creature like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

652
00:38:34.711 --> 00:38:35.544
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's no wonder you're a bit cracked and </v>

653
00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:38.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe somewhat dangerous,</v>

654
00:38:38.921 --> 00:38:40.480
<v Speaker 1>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

655
00:38:40.481 --> 00:38:42.370
<v Speaker 1>you've got the motivation for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

656
00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:45.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little understanding might be an order,</v>

657
00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:49.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I see people who are agoraphobic,</v>

658
00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:51.430
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come and say to me,</v>

659
00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:53.380
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've become afraid of everything.</v>

660
00:38:53.381 --> 00:38:55.060
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

661
00:38:55.610 --> 00:38:56.443
<v Speaker 1>that's easy to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just can't figure out how the hell it </v>

662
00:38:59.351 --> 00:39:00.880
<v Speaker 1>was ever any different than that.</v>

663
00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:04.570
<v Speaker 1>How did you ever manage to not be afraid</v>
<v Speaker 1>of everything?</v>

664
00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:07.660
<v Speaker 1>Because that's the question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

665
00:39:07.661 --> 00:39:09.910
<v Speaker 1>and that's the fundamental existential </v>
<v Speaker 1>question too.</v>

666
00:39:09.911 --> 00:39:13.330
<v Speaker 1>When you're surrounded by infinite </v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability,</v>

667
00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:16.240
<v Speaker 1>how the hell can you stay calm?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

668
00:39:16.241 --> 00:39:17.074
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part,</v>

669
00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:18.033
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of answers to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've explored some of that partly is </v>

670
00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:22.960
<v Speaker 1>where you organize yourself with </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody else.</v>

671
00:39:22.961 --> 00:39:26.160
<v Speaker 1>So the chaos is at least held at bay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

672
00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:27.063
<v Speaker 1>you're not confronted every single </v>
<v Speaker 1>second with the possibility of insanity </v>

673
00:39:31.061 --> 00:39:31.894
<v Speaker 1>or disease or death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could put some distance between you </v>

674
00:39:35.381 --> 00:39:37.210
<v Speaker 1>and that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's not an illusion.</v>

675
00:39:37.211 --> 00:39:39.950
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

676
00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:44.960
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to spend the night in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hospital room where an epidemic of Ebola</v>

677
00:39:44.961 --> 00:39:45.794
<v Speaker 1>is raging and that's not a psychological</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem that you just don't want to be </v>

678
00:39:50.091 --> 00:39:54.410
<v Speaker 1>there and intelligibly so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so even putting any distance between you</v>

679
00:39:54.411 --> 00:39:55.244
<v Speaker 1>and that outcome isn't the losery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then then there's the other things </v>

680
00:39:59.001 --> 00:40:00.200
<v Speaker 1>that we do too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are,</v>

681
00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:05.230
<v Speaker 1>which is try to find meaningful things </v>
<v Speaker 1>within the confines of our own lives and</v>

682
00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:09.463
<v Speaker 1>the destructive and nihilistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophies basically always claimed </v>

683
00:40:12.101 --> 00:40:15.290
<v Speaker 1>that that's delusional and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that.</v>

684
00:40:15.291 --> 00:40:16.124
<v Speaker 1>I think that's wrong and I think it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous and I think it's almost </v>

685
00:40:19.310 --> 00:40:20.143
<v Speaker 1>everything that students are taught in </v>
<v Speaker 1>universities and so over the last 10 </v>

686
00:40:24.351 --> 00:40:28.250
<v Speaker 1>years it seemed to me to be in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe this is an overstatement,</v>

687
00:40:28.251 --> 00:40:29.084
<v Speaker 1>but the university education in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>humanities and often in the social </v>

688
00:40:31.851 --> 00:40:34.460
<v Speaker 1>sciences causes more harm than it does </v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

689
00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:35.953
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because this is basically what it </v>

690
00:40:37.101 --> 00:40:37.934
<v Speaker 1>teaches students at a point in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>life where instead of confronting the </v>

691
00:40:41.631 --> 00:40:44.740
<v Speaker 1>radical uncertainty underneath </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything is that,</v>

692
00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:46.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should be invited into life.</v>

693
00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:52.690
<v Speaker 1>Helped find a niche that's fulfilling </v>
<v Speaker 1>from a human perspective,</v>

694
00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:53.713
<v Speaker 1>master that and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe start thinking about extending </v>

695
00:40:56.691 --> 00:40:59.030
<v Speaker 1>yourself a little bit beyond that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the unknown,</v>

696
00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:02.990
<v Speaker 1>but to take people who hardly know what </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hell they're doing to begin with and</v>

697
00:41:02.991 --> 00:41:07.570
<v Speaker 1>then expose them to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a postmodernist,</v>

698
00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:12.260
<v Speaker 1>ultra rational,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental critique of everything.</v>

699
00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:13.153
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you expect is going to happen </v>

700
00:41:14.271 --> 00:41:17.000
<v Speaker 1>when people have that experience?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus I think it's.</v>

701
00:41:17.090 --> 00:41:19.910
<v Speaker 1>I think it's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the worst of it.</v>

702
00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:21.073
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's factually true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's philosophically true </v>

703
00:41:24.530 --> 00:41:27.770
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a bad combination.</v>

704
00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:29.023
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the reason I think that people </v>

705
00:41:30.261 --> 00:41:35.261
<v Speaker 1>do this and are such admirers of </v>
<v Speaker 1>postmodern nihilism is that it abdicates</v>

706
00:41:35.841 --> 00:41:38.630
<v Speaker 1>the necessity of responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

707
00:41:38.631 --> 00:41:39.590
<v Speaker 1>because people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

708
00:41:39.591 --> 00:41:40.424
<v Speaker 1>I'm just thinking it through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're never just thinking </v>

709
00:41:42.561 --> 00:41:43.394
<v Speaker 1>something through the probability that </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation has nothing to do with that </v>

710
00:41:46.881 --> 00:41:47.714
<v Speaker 1>is zero because we already know just </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the things we covered in this </v>

711
00:41:51.141 --> 00:41:54.230
<v Speaker 1>class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that motivation frames your perceptions.</v>

712
00:41:54.231 --> 00:41:56.660
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't even see the damn gorilla when</v>

713
00:41:56.661 --> 00:41:58.730
<v Speaker 1>you're counting the basketballs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

714
00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:02.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're formulating a rationalist,</v>

715
00:42:02.221 --> 00:42:04.580
<v Speaker 1>a critique of everything and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

716
00:42:04.581 --> 00:42:05.960
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I'm not motivated.</v>

717
00:42:05.961 --> 00:42:09.500
<v Speaker 1>It's like while you're motivated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you count the basketballs,</v>

718
00:42:09.501 --> 00:42:10.334
<v Speaker 1>and so the probability that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivated when you're doing something </v>

719
00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:13.033
<v Speaker 1>far more extensive and difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is 100 percent no human would </v>

720
00:42:19.071 --> 00:42:19.904
<v Speaker 1>say</v>
<v Speaker 1>know this is when we get back to the </v>

721
00:42:23.511 --> 00:42:25.880
<v Speaker 1>mythological underpinnings of things as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

722
00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:28.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

723
00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:29.630
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

724
00:42:29.631 --> 00:42:30.464
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

725
00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:32.733
<v Speaker 2>Egyptian</v>

726
00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:38.410
<v Speaker 1>myth of creation and reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

727
00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:39.413
<v Speaker 1>cyrus is the figure of tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he sort of represents the dominance </v>

728
00:42:43.661 --> 00:42:46.870
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy roughly speaking in all of its</v>
<v Speaker 1>manifestations.</v>

729
00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:52.680
<v Speaker 1>And he has an evil brother named seth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seth is a typical figure in fairytales.</v>

730
00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:54.573
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the lion king you see scar who's </v>

731
00:42:56.290 --> 00:42:57.123
<v Speaker 1>exactly the same figure and the scar </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of seth figure stands for the </v>

732
00:43:01.391 --> 00:43:05.430
<v Speaker 1>proclivity of bureaucracies to </v>
<v Speaker 1>degenerate into look malevolent,</v>

733
00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:07.960
<v Speaker 1>totalitarian states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is always a problem,</v>

734
00:43:07.961 --> 00:43:08.794
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they,</v>

735
00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:09.863
<v Speaker 1>a rigidity fly and then press,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the price you pay for existing </v>

736
00:43:15.761 --> 00:43:18.600
<v Speaker 1>within a hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they rigidified Oh,</v>

737
00:43:18.610 --> 00:43:21.550
<v Speaker 1>press sometimes because that's just what</v>
<v Speaker 1>happens as the age.</v>

738
00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:26.760
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes because there's a a voice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm recommending that as a motive being,</v>

739
00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:31.390
<v Speaker 1>it's okay if you do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's okay if you break this rule,</v>

740
00:43:31.450 --> 00:43:32.283
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell difference does it make </v>

741
00:43:34.031 --> 00:43:38.890
<v Speaker 1>any ways you see some of that being </v>
<v Speaker 1>played out right now with the revelation</v>

742
00:43:38.891 --> 00:43:40.780
<v Speaker 1>of all those Panama papers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

743
00:43:41.290 --> 00:43:44.260
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a huge revelation of corruption</v>

744
00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:49.420
<v Speaker 1>at hardly surprising at high levels of </v>
<v Speaker 1>power all around the world.</v>

745
00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:51.280
<v Speaker 1>Now I see the</v>

746
00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:55.173
<v Speaker 1>no at the bottom of everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is the archetypal Dabs I see </v>

747
00:43:58.901 --> 00:44:03.901
<v Speaker 1>this battle in the human soul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically between an attitude that says,</v>

748
00:44:06.610 --> 00:44:07.443
<v Speaker 1>despite its limitations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>life is valuable and worth preserving </v>

749
00:44:11.201 --> 00:44:12.034
<v Speaker 1>and improving as proposition one and </v>
<v Speaker 1>proposition is the suffering that life </v>

750
00:44:17.081 --> 00:44:17.914
<v Speaker 1>involves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>renders it ethically untenable and </v>

751
00:44:21.310 --> 00:44:24.010
<v Speaker 1>physiologically and psychologically </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbearable.</v>

752
00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:27.040
<v Speaker 1>And as a consequence of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it should just be eradicated.</v>

753
00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:29.800
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a binary choice is some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>

754
00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:33.330
<v Speaker 1>yes to be in or no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

755
00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:36.450
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can conjure up powerful arguments on</v>

756
00:44:36.451 --> 00:44:37.284
<v Speaker 1>both sides of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to some degree your whole being is </v>

757
00:44:40.861 --> 00:44:45.050
<v Speaker 1>an argument between those two questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

758
00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:48.900
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things that young said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is extremely worthwhile,</v>

759
00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:53.310
<v Speaker 1>is that you should figure out what </v>
<v Speaker 1>archetypal forces are in charge of your,</v>

760
00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:57.240
<v Speaker 1>of your ba because they're there whether</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know it or not.</v>

761
00:44:57.270 --> 00:44:58.103
<v Speaker 1>Now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've walked through that with some </v>

762
00:44:58.801 --> 00:44:59.634
<v Speaker 1>detail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could look at it in a sense from a </v>

763
00:45:01.891 --> 00:45:05.970
<v Speaker 1>biological perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more mechanistic.</v>

764
00:45:05.971 --> 00:45:06.804
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're a tool of hunger and anger </v>

765
00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:13.640
<v Speaker 1>and fear and love and loss and all those</v>
<v Speaker 1>primordial forces that</v>

766
00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:16.473
<v Speaker 2>that</v>

767
00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:19.293
<v Speaker 1>make up your field of experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a purely biological way of </v>

768
00:45:22.801 --> 00:45:25.770
<v Speaker 1>thinking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more architectural way of thinking about</v>

769
00:45:25.771 --> 00:45:26.604
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just that those things are actually </v>

770
00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:32.160
<v Speaker 1>characters or personalities and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>organized into hierarchies that are also</v>

771
00:45:32.161 --> 00:45:34.440
<v Speaker 1>characters and personalities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

772
00:45:34.441 --> 00:45:38.800
<v Speaker 1>an anger and fear and resentment and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hatred and carton.</v>

773
00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:42.240
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the carnivorous soul of human beings and</v>

774
00:45:42.241 --> 00:45:43.074
<v Speaker 1>all of those things aggregate into one </v>
<v Speaker 1>form of Metta personality and all the </v>

775
00:45:46.981 --> 00:45:51.981
<v Speaker 1>things that you might think about as </v>
<v Speaker 1>existing in opposition to that aggregate</v>

776
00:45:52.081 --> 00:45:54.100
<v Speaker 1>into another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the.</v>

777
00:45:54.350 --> 00:45:58.440
<v Speaker 1>The top most struggled for integration </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a struggle between those two things.</v>

778
00:45:58.590 --> 00:46:01.350
<v Speaker 1>That's a very common mythological theme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

779
00:46:01.410 --> 00:46:04.140
<v Speaker 1>that's basically the battle between good</v>
<v Speaker 1>and evil in heaven</v>

780
00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:08.690
<v Speaker 1>and that's an unbelievably old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a.</v>

781
00:46:08.710 --> 00:46:12.640
<v Speaker 1>it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an old idea as human beings have no</v>

782
00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:14.920
<v Speaker 1>the battle of the gods for dominance and</v>
<v Speaker 1>habit,</v>

783
00:46:15.070 --> 00:46:17.200
<v Speaker 1>even if it's not strictly between good </v>
<v Speaker 1>and evil.</v>

784
00:46:17.201 --> 00:46:18.034
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if it hasn't been developed to the </v>

785
00:46:18.971 --> 00:46:19.804
<v Speaker 1>point of that ultimate opposition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still a battle at some level </v>

786
00:46:23.741 --> 00:46:27.280
<v Speaker 1>between titanic forces for domination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

787
00:46:27.310 --> 00:46:28.143
<v Speaker 1>that's partly a description of your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>psyche and partly a description of the </v>

788
00:46:33.521 --> 00:46:36.400
<v Speaker 1>organization or lack thereof of </v>
<v Speaker 1>societies across</v>

789
00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:38.230
<v Speaker 2>time and.</v>

790
00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:42.173
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it seems to me that that one of the </v>

791
00:46:43.741 --> 00:46:46.890
<v Speaker 1>things young was insistent upon because </v>
<v Speaker 1>he was trying to,</v>

792
00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:51.660
<v Speaker 1>and many of the fingers that we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>covered in this,</v>

793
00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:54.120
<v Speaker 1>in this series,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

794
00:46:54.130 --> 00:46:56.190
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were trying to answer the question.</v>

795
00:46:56.191 --> 00:46:57.024
<v Speaker 1>This was especially true for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>clinicians of how it is that an </v>

796
00:47:00.301 --> 00:47:05.301
<v Speaker 1>individual should conduct themselves so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that their mode of being is optimized.</v>

797
00:47:05.370 --> 00:47:06.900
<v Speaker 1>You could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's mental health,</v>

798
00:47:06.901 --> 00:47:07.734
<v Speaker 1>but that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a radically insufficient way of </v>

799
00:47:10.291 --> 00:47:11.610
<v Speaker 1>describing that because,</v>

800
00:47:14.110 --> 00:47:14.943
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not merely the absence of </v>

801
00:47:15.701 --> 00:47:17.770
<v Speaker 1>pathology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something much more complex.</v>

802
00:47:17.771 --> 00:47:20.200
<v Speaker 1>That's something active and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>even individual.</v>

803
00:47:20.201 --> 00:47:22.000
<v Speaker 1>It's individual and social,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

804
00:47:22.010 --> 00:47:22.843
<v Speaker 1>because you're not going to be mentally </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy unless you're integrated into a </v>

805
00:47:25.481 --> 00:47:26.314
<v Speaker 1>functioning social community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just can't do it because other are </v>

806
00:47:29.351 --> 00:47:31.070
<v Speaker 1>part of what keeps you sane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

807
00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:33.460
<v Speaker 1>because they're always whacking you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you get out of line a little bit,</v>

808
00:47:33.461 --> 00:47:34.294
<v Speaker 1>they just tap you with sarcasm or raised</v>
<v Speaker 1>eyebrows or frowns or smiles or they're </v>

809
00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:42.790
<v Speaker 1>constantly tapping you into being a </v>
<v Speaker 1>proper person.</v>

810
00:47:42.791 --> 00:47:44.170
<v Speaker 1>Whatever the hell that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

811
00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:46.390
<v Speaker 1>but they're telling you all the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>what it is.</v>

812
00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:47.993
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

813
00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:55.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so niches.</v>

814
00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:56.263
<v Speaker 1>Idea was that the modern world had </v>
<v Speaker 1>landed itself in hot water because it's </v>

815
00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:01.933
<v Speaker 1>own proclivity for searching out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The truth had undermined it's faith in </v>

816
00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:10.580
<v Speaker 1>traditional axioms of morality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fair enough.</v>

817
00:48:10.581 --> 00:48:12.890
<v Speaker 1>That seems about right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

818
00:48:12.891 --> 00:48:17.120
<v Speaker 1>and his cure for that was that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>became,</v>

819
00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:21.260
<v Speaker 1>he called it over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men often translated as superman,</v>

820
00:48:21.261 --> 00:48:22.094
<v Speaker 1>which were people who created their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>values to fill the void left by the </v>

821
00:48:26.691 --> 00:48:27.524
<v Speaker 1>absence of traditional values,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a bunch of problems with </v>

822
00:48:30.081 --> 00:48:30.914
<v Speaker 1>that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is individuals probably can't do it </v>

823
00:48:33.681 --> 00:48:35.570
<v Speaker 1>because they don't live long enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and second,</v>

824
00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:36.793
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean just from my perspective of what </v>

825
00:48:39.621 --> 00:48:40.454
<v Speaker 1>are you going to be the best philosopher</v>
<v Speaker 1>who ever lived because that's really </v>

826
00:48:42.891 --> 00:48:43.724
<v Speaker 1>what it requires and then the third </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem is what makes you think you </v>

827
00:48:47.271 --> 00:48:48.104
<v Speaker 1>create values?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it doesn't phenomenologically </v>

828
00:48:50.631 --> 00:48:51.980
<v Speaker 1>obvious that you do.</v>

829
00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:55.370
<v Speaker 1>It's more like you experienced them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you don't even know where they</v>

830
00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:57.710
<v Speaker 1>came come from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get angry.</v>

831
00:48:57.950 --> 00:48:58.783
<v Speaker 1>Do you know why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you'll have to think about it for </v>

832
00:49:00.921 --> 00:49:05.921
<v Speaker 1>like three days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in what way you created that as well.</v>

833
00:49:07.070 --> 00:49:10.130
<v Speaker 1>It's not self evident and young's idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

834
00:49:10.131 --> 00:49:10.964
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the forces that we had regarded as </v>

835
00:49:14.330 --> 00:49:19.100
<v Speaker 1>traditional sources of values,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're actually spontaneous constructions</v>

836
00:49:19.101 --> 00:49:23.180
<v Speaker 1>of the human psyche.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They weren't arbitrary systems of rules.</v>

837
00:49:23.181 --> 00:49:24.014
<v Speaker 1>They were way deeper than that and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think if you have an ounce of biologist </v>

838
00:49:28.331 --> 00:49:30.680
<v Speaker 1>in you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you immediately read that and think,</v>

839
00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:31.810
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

840
00:49:31.850 --> 00:49:34.820
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously you know,</v>

841
00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:37.940
<v Speaker 1>even the social rules that govern a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy,</v>

842
00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:41.210
<v Speaker 1>like they're instilled in you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know them,</v>

843
00:49:41.211 --> 00:49:42.044
<v Speaker 1>they're right in your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so there's a biological basis for </v>

844
00:49:44.631 --> 00:49:48.680
<v Speaker 1>your understanding of culture right at </v>
<v Speaker 1>that level that's damn near spinal,</v>

845
00:49:48.710 --> 00:49:52.360
<v Speaker 1>like it's old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>

846
00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:55.910
<v Speaker 1>secondary proposition was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is quite an interesting one,</v>

847
00:49:55.970 --> 00:49:56.803
<v Speaker 1>is that by attending to your fantasies </v>
<v Speaker 1>and your dreams and your daydreams for </v>

848
00:50:01.041 --> 00:50:01.874
<v Speaker 1>that matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can come into contact with some of </v>

849
00:50:04.461 --> 00:50:08.810
<v Speaker 1>the primordial psychic forces that </v>
<v Speaker 1>originally produced religious revelation</v>

850
00:50:09.590 --> 00:50:13.250
<v Speaker 1>and so that you can find what's lost by </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking within,</v>

851
00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:15.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's basically the entire point of</v>

852
00:50:15.621 --> 00:50:18.470
<v Speaker 1>union psychotherapy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of the reason I'm concentrating</v>

853
00:50:18.471 --> 00:50:21.560
<v Speaker 1>on young is because guys like Rogers,</v>

854
00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:26.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the phenomenologists they're,</v>

855
00:50:26.670 --> 00:50:27.503
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're moving down the same trail of </v>

856
00:50:29.211 --> 00:50:30.044
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't get as far as young as </v>

857
00:50:31.251 --> 00:50:32.084
<v Speaker 1>far as I could tell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they never took it to its ultimate </v>

858
00:50:33.981 --> 00:50:35.330
<v Speaker 1>conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

859
00:50:35.331 --> 00:50:36.164
<v Speaker 1>like maslow for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about a hierarchy of needs and the </v>

860
00:50:40.090 --> 00:50:40.923
<v Speaker 1>self actualized person was someone who </v>
<v Speaker 1>had accomplished all those basic needs </v>

861
00:50:45.351 --> 00:50:46.940
<v Speaker 1>and popped out at the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like</v>

862
00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:51.350
<v Speaker 1>kind of true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sort of primitive,</v>

863
00:50:51.470 --> 00:50:52.303
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it is by no means obvious that </v>

864
00:50:53.691 --> 00:50:54.524
<v Speaker 1>you have to take care of all your basic </v>
<v Speaker 1>material needs before you can act </v>

865
00:50:58.491 --> 00:51:00.590
<v Speaker 1>morally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a foolish idea.</v>

866
00:51:01.010 --> 00:51:01.843
<v Speaker 1>It assumes that people are going to get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they're going to be become more </v>

867
00:51:05.151 --> 00:51:05.984
<v Speaker 1>moral as they get richer now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm not saying they become less </v>

868
00:51:09.411 --> 00:51:10.244
<v Speaker 1>moral because I don't believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't see that there's any </v>

869
00:51:11.931 --> 00:51:13.280
<v Speaker 1>positive association.</v>

870
00:51:13.310 --> 00:51:14.143
<v Speaker 1>It's just you can use it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can use your wealth well or you can </v>

871
00:51:17.451 --> 00:51:20.840
<v Speaker 1>use it badly just like you can use your </v>
<v Speaker 1>poverty well or use it badly.</v>

872
00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:23.720
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maslow,</v>

873
00:51:23.721 --> 00:51:24.381
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

874
00:51:24.381 --> 00:51:25.490
<v Speaker 1>there's a hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

875
00:51:25.491 --> 00:51:27.140
<v Speaker 1>something emerges at the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

876
00:51:27.141 --> 00:51:29.330
<v Speaker 1>it's not a consequence of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fulfillment of needs.</v>

877
00:51:29.331 --> 00:51:32.920
<v Speaker 1>It's way too materialistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's basically like a utopian select,</v>

878
00:51:32.980 --> 00:51:35.030
<v Speaker 1>a utopian socialist idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

879
00:51:35.031 --> 00:51:38.390
<v Speaker 1>If you feed people enough cake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden everyone will get along.</v>

880
00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:40.130
<v Speaker 1>It's like people aren't like that at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

881
00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:41.773
<v Speaker 1>So you took this idea of personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>development as far as I can tell to its </v>

882
00:51:46.011 --> 00:51:46.844
<v Speaker 1>ultimate extreme to its logical </v>
<v Speaker 1>conclusion and that's where he ran into </v>

883
00:51:49.551 --> 00:51:50.384
<v Speaker 1>the archetypes because what archetypes </v>
<v Speaker 1>are in some sense is the ultimate </v>

884
00:51:53.571 --> 00:51:57.080
<v Speaker 1>instantiation of an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't go beyond.</v>

885
00:51:57.410 --> 00:51:59.210
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's an archetype,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

886
00:51:59.211 --> 00:52:00.890
<v Speaker 1>So there's an archetype of death.</v>

887
00:52:01.070 --> 00:52:02.750
<v Speaker 1>Well why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

888
00:52:02.751 --> 00:52:03.584
<v Speaker 1>because he can't go past that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like words fail when you're confronted </v>

889
00:52:06.951 --> 00:52:09.890
<v Speaker 1>by that and there's an archetype of love</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

890
00:52:09.891 --> 00:52:10.724
<v Speaker 1>there's an archetype of evil and all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those things are there beyond </v>

891
00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:18.650
<v Speaker 1>articulation and in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in their archetipal form.</v>

892
00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:19.633
<v Speaker 1>And they are the place where you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>articulated thought ceases to be </v>

893
00:52:23.601 --> 00:52:27.290
<v Speaker 1>relevant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for young,</v>

894
00:52:27.291 --> 00:52:29.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the self development</v>

895
00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:36.050
<v Speaker 1>route was the confrontation of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you had abandoned within.</v>

896
00:52:37.370 --> 00:52:38.203
<v Speaker 1>Now I've been thinking about young for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>very long time and I think that one of </v>

897
00:52:43.221 --> 00:52:44.054
<v Speaker 1>the things that struck me about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cycle analyst is that they're much too </v>

898
00:52:46.461 --> 00:52:47.294
<v Speaker 1>concerned about the idea that if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>properly properly organized as a human </v>

899
00:52:52.911 --> 00:52:56.060
<v Speaker 1>being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that organization is interest psychic.</v>

900
00:52:56.090 --> 00:53:00.260
<v Speaker 1>Like it's in you somehow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and which is,</v>

901
00:53:00.270 --> 00:53:01.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

902
00:53:01.070 --> 00:53:01.903
<v Speaker 1>so for young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hero's journey was a journey into </v>

903
00:53:03.531 --> 00:53:06.530
<v Speaker 1>the unconscious and individual journey </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the unconscious.</v>

904
00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:08.293
<v Speaker 1>Now he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he started to see flaws in that idea as </v>

905
00:53:11.121 --> 00:53:11.954
<v Speaker 1>he moved forward with this thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But one of the flaws in that idea is </v>

906
00:53:14.691 --> 00:53:19.610
<v Speaker 1>that you're not only individually not at</v>
<v Speaker 1>all and if you're,</v>

907
00:53:19.940 --> 00:53:20.773
<v Speaker 1>if you're situated properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll say in being your relationships </v>

908
00:53:26.251 --> 00:53:27.084
<v Speaker 1>are healthy as well as the proper </v>
<v Speaker 1>balance being struck inside you between </v>

909
00:53:32.550 --> 00:53:34.890
<v Speaker 1>the competing sub personalities that </v>
<v Speaker 1>make you up.</v>

910
00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:36.810
<v Speaker 1>And those things are actually not </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

911
00:53:37.050 --> 00:53:39.510
<v Speaker 1>And you know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't have one without the other.</v>

912
00:53:40.290 --> 00:53:41.123
<v Speaker 1>So to think about them even as separate </v>
<v Speaker 1>spheres is improper in a sense because </v>

913
00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:50.160
<v Speaker 1>you're limited in your wellbeing by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wellbeing of those people who are,</v>

914
00:53:50.330 --> 00:53:52.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in concentric circles around you.</v>

915
00:53:53.340 --> 00:53:57.240
<v Speaker 1>And no matter how well organized you are</v>
<v Speaker 1>internally,</v>

916
00:53:58.050 --> 00:54:00.160
<v Speaker 1>it's insufficient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

917
00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:01.033
<v Speaker 1>you see that reflective in stories like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the story of the Buddha because at one </v>

918
00:54:03.421 --> 00:54:08.421
<v Speaker 1>point the Buddha after being walloped by</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge of old age sickness and death,</v>

919
00:54:09.811 --> 00:54:10.644
<v Speaker 1>because that's really what does it mean </v>
<v Speaker 1>he attains enlightenment under a tree </v>

920
00:54:14.101 --> 00:54:15.210
<v Speaker 1>for variety of reasons.</v>

921
00:54:15.210 --> 00:54:16.940
<v Speaker 1>We won't go into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

922
00:54:16.950 --> 00:54:17.783
<v Speaker 1>so he's attain the perfect state of </v>
<v Speaker 1>primarily subjective Ba and that's sort </v>

923
00:54:22.591 --> 00:54:24.480
<v Speaker 1>of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a temptation.</v>

924
00:54:24.510 --> 00:54:25.343
<v Speaker 1>There is a temptation to remain there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he shuts that down and then goes </v>

925
00:54:28.471 --> 00:54:29.304
<v Speaker 1>back into the world and teaches people </v>
<v Speaker 1>because his realization is nirvana </v>

926
00:54:32.821 --> 00:54:35.520
<v Speaker 1>attained individually is not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nervana,</v>

927
00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:38.940
<v Speaker 1>you can't be not suffering in a sea of </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering.</v>

928
00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:39.833
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that means is that you've got a </v>

929
00:54:40.531 --> 00:54:43.440
<v Speaker 1>particular kind of blinder on and so you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

930
00:54:43.441 --> 00:54:45.750
<v Speaker 1>he goes back so to speak and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffers.</v>

931
00:54:46.670 --> 00:54:49.440
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mythologically speaking suffers a normal</v>

932
00:54:49.441 --> 00:54:50.274
<v Speaker 1>human death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in some sense that's portrayed as </v>

933
00:54:52.831 --> 00:54:53.664
<v Speaker 1>voluntary.</v>

934
00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:55.013
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

935
00:55:02.010 --> 00:55:04.560
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I show People Pinocchio in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this class.</v>

936
00:55:04.561 --> 00:55:07.020
<v Speaker 1>I think we did a little bit of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did we do a little bit of that?</v>

937
00:55:07.980 --> 00:55:09.180
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

938
00:55:09.270 --> 00:55:10.103
<v Speaker 1>in Pinocchio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio was trying to become a real </v>

939
00:55:13.531 --> 00:55:18.360
<v Speaker 1>person and he have to do a variety of </v>
<v Speaker 1>very strange things to manage that,</v>

940
00:55:18.570 --> 00:55:19.403
<v Speaker 1>one of which is to go down into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>depths of the ocean and confront the </v>

941
00:55:22.921 --> 00:55:27.921
<v Speaker 1>most frightening thing roughly speaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>and simultaneously rescue his father,</v>

942
00:55:28.780 --> 00:55:30.990
<v Speaker 1>which is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very strange set of ideas.</v>

943
00:55:30.991 --> 00:55:31.824
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely a descent into the </v>

944
00:55:33.121 --> 00:55:33.954
<v Speaker 1>underworld.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's elements of Jonah and the whale </v>

945
00:55:35.311 --> 00:55:37.050
<v Speaker 1>in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was very,</v>

946
00:55:37.051 --> 00:55:37.884
<v Speaker 1>very old story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's an idea that's very much </v>

947
00:55:40.831 --> 00:55:41.664
<v Speaker 1>associated with union thinking too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is that in the in the </v>

948
00:55:44.610 --> 00:55:49.610
<v Speaker 1>background chaos of your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are depths and in those depths are</v>

949
00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:56.370
<v Speaker 1>what the forgotten or non articulate </v>
<v Speaker 1>structures of your culture.</v>

950
00:55:56.371 --> 00:56:00.930
<v Speaker 1>But more than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the forgotten or non articulate parts of</v>

951
00:56:00.931 --> 00:56:03.150
<v Speaker 1>your psyche that would make it a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural,</v>

952
00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:04.253
<v Speaker 1>a culture creating entity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that that has to be discovered in </v>

953
00:56:08.731 --> 00:56:12.210
<v Speaker 1>order for you to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To have the courage to be an individual.</v>

954
00:56:13.970 --> 00:56:16.960
<v Speaker 1>And there's nothing delusional about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

955
00:56:16.961 --> 00:56:20.470
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the idea there as opposed to say</v>

956
00:56:20.710 --> 00:56:21.543
<v Speaker 1>the typical nihilistic or terror </v>
<v Speaker 1>theories is that if you got your act </v>

957
00:56:25.811 --> 00:56:29.260
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fear of death would no longer be the</v>

958
00:56:29.410 --> 00:56:31.630
<v Speaker 1>thing that fundamentally rules you like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

959
00:56:31.631 --> 00:56:32.464
<v Speaker 1>That's actually possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a weird idea there and the </v>

960
00:56:34.541 --> 00:56:39.541
<v Speaker 1>idea is not the fear of vulnerability in</v>
<v Speaker 1>death is irrelevant or not.</v>

961
00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:41.733
<v Speaker 1>Not even that it's not central,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that people are so God damn tough </v>

962
00:56:46.030 --> 00:56:46.863
<v Speaker 1>that it's possible that they can face </v>
<v Speaker 1>that directly and say that's not going </v>

963
00:56:51.011 --> 00:56:54.220
<v Speaker 1>to be what rules my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I believe people can do that.</v>

964
00:56:54.221 --> 00:56:56.650
<v Speaker 1>I've seen people do that certainly in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their careers.</v>

965
00:56:56.990 --> 00:56:57.823
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if they can't articulate that </v>

966
00:56:58.991 --> 00:56:59.824
<v Speaker 1>philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put them in a situation where </v>

967
00:57:01.271 --> 00:57:05.240
<v Speaker 1>they're doing nothing but dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>death and destruction and you know,</v>

968
00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:08.800
<v Speaker 1>they can do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is mind boggling and a great thing</v>

969
00:57:08.801 --> 00:57:09.730
<v Speaker 1>to be able to see.</v>

970
00:57:10.390 --> 00:57:11.730
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

971
00:57:12.010 --> 00:57:16.000
<v Speaker 1>you search in vain throughout the annals</v>
<v Speaker 1>of psychology for optimistic ideas.</v>

972
00:57:16.540 --> 00:57:17.373
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's particularly true </v>
<v Speaker 1>with regards to like the more </v>

973
00:57:19.961 --> 00:57:20.794
<v Speaker 1>experimental brands of psychology that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are associated with being like social </v>

974
00:57:23.711 --> 00:57:24.544
<v Speaker 1>psychology personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll leave out of this for the time </v>

975
00:57:27.041 --> 00:57:29.380
<v Speaker 1>being because it's become more </v>
<v Speaker 1>statistical,</v>

976
00:57:29.381 --> 00:57:30.214
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that there's enough in you </v>

977
00:57:34.420 --> 00:57:35.253
<v Speaker 1>so that if you don't flinch from life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can become strong enough to master </v>

978
00:57:39.371 --> 00:57:41.680
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an amazing idea.</v>

979
00:57:41.790 --> 00:57:44.770
<v Speaker 1>It's the only optimistic idea I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>seen that's profound,</v>

980
00:57:44.771 --> 00:57:45.604
<v Speaker 1>that I absolutely believe has most of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the profound ideas that are easy to </v>

981
00:57:48.731 --> 00:57:51.190
<v Speaker 1>believe are terrible ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

982
00:57:51.370 --> 00:57:52.203
<v Speaker 1>they have to do with the inevitability </v>
<v Speaker 1>of malevolence and death and insanity </v>

983
00:57:55.661 --> 00:57:57.490
<v Speaker 1>and suffering and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

984
00:57:57.491 --> 00:57:59.770
<v Speaker 1>those things kind of blow through your </v>
<v Speaker 1>persona.</v>

985
00:58:00.100 --> 00:58:03.190
<v Speaker 1>But trying to find something optimistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>to counterbalance that.</v>

986
00:58:03.850 --> 00:58:05.740
<v Speaker 1>That's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

987
00:58:05.741 --> 00:58:10.120
<v Speaker 1>the other thing we know about people now</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we didn't know a few years ago</v>

988
00:58:14.230 --> 00:58:19.230
<v Speaker 1>is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you put yourself in new environments,</v>

989
00:58:20.351 --> 00:58:22.360
<v Speaker 1>you actually change yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>genetically.</v>

990
00:58:23.420 --> 00:58:24.253
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I take you out of your safe </v>

991
00:58:26.291 --> 00:58:27.970
<v Speaker 1>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>start to expose,</v>

992
00:58:27.971 --> 00:58:30.610
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say to situations that you fear.</v>

993
00:58:31.330 --> 00:58:32.163
<v Speaker 1>You could say that one of the reasons </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you transform is because you </v>

994
00:58:34.691 --> 00:58:37.810
<v Speaker 1>observe yourself mastering those </v>
<v Speaker 1>situations,</v>

995
00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:40.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you get bigger,</v>

996
00:58:40.450 --> 00:58:42.730
<v Speaker 1>so to speak in the situations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get smaller,</v>

997
00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:44.590
<v Speaker 1>lovely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>

998
00:58:44.620 --> 00:58:47.650
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can account for that by learning,</v>

999
00:58:48.850 --> 00:58:51.760
<v Speaker 1>but there's an additional dimension that</v>
<v Speaker 1>might be related to the learning,</v>

1000
00:58:51.790 --> 00:58:55.000
<v Speaker 1>which is that if you put yourself into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>new situation,</v>

1001
00:58:55.450 --> 00:58:59.690
<v Speaker 1>then different proteins start to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>encoded in your brain and you know,</v>

1002
00:58:59.710 --> 00:59:02.590
<v Speaker 1>and the rest of your nervous system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you actually transmute,</v>

1003
00:59:02.620 --> 00:59:03.453
<v Speaker 1>literally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the total range of human </v>

1004
00:59:05.561 --> 00:59:10.561
<v Speaker 1>transmutation is unexplored.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's this idea.</v>

1005
00:59:11.950 --> 00:59:14.440
<v Speaker 1>Let me show you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a cool thing to know about.</v>

1006
00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:16.593
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1007
00:59:40.580 --> 00:59:43.550
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a picture of a labyrinth at,</v>

1008
00:59:43.580 --> 00:59:44.413
<v Speaker 1>in the shark feed federal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now a cathedral is shaped like a cross </v>

1009
00:59:50.570 --> 00:59:51.403
<v Speaker 1>and then the focal point of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cathedrals right at the middle of the </v>

1010
00:59:55.821 --> 00:59:58.460
<v Speaker 1>Cross and the cross is an x,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

1011
00:59:58.461 --> 01:00:03.461
<v Speaker 1>in the center of the x is where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason it's a cross between this</v>

1012
01:00:04.310 --> 01:00:06.500
<v Speaker 1>because of the center of that x is </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering.</v>

1013
01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:10.730
<v Speaker 1>And so the central aspect of </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness,</v>

1014
01:00:10.731 --> 01:00:13.370
<v Speaker 1>of being his integrity associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering,</v>

1015
01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:14.840
<v Speaker 1>betrayal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of those things,</v>

1016
01:00:15.050 --> 01:00:17.030
<v Speaker 1>that's the nature of the center of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

1017
01:00:17.530 --> 01:00:19.280
<v Speaker 1>And so then the question might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1018
01:00:19.281 --> 01:00:20.900
<v Speaker 1>how do you cope with that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1019
01:00:21.110 --> 01:00:25.910
<v Speaker 1>the typical religious ideas that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>identify with a hero figure of some sort</v>

1020
01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:27.313
<v Speaker 1>and although that's often warped and </v>
<v Speaker 1>morphed into the idea that you believe </v>

1021
01:00:30.991 --> 01:00:32.540
<v Speaker 1>in them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not what.</v>

1022
01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:34.100
<v Speaker 1>It's not the right idea.</v>

1023
01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:36.530
<v Speaker 1>The right idea is that you identify </v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

1024
01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:40.250
<v Speaker 1>So I can give you an example from that </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Christian mass ceremony,</v>

1025
01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:44.450
<v Speaker 1>which is actually a cannibalistic ritual</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a very,</v>

1026
01:00:44.451 --> 01:00:47.480
<v Speaker 1>very old idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the idea is that you become what you</v>

1027
01:00:47.481 --> 01:00:49.320
<v Speaker 1>ingest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1028
01:00:49.370 --> 01:00:52.790
<v Speaker 1>And so it's the mass ceremony which is </v>
<v Speaker 1>in principle,</v>

1029
01:00:52.791 --> 01:00:53.624
<v Speaker 1>the eating of the flesh of a god is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>a ritual to instantiate articulated </v>

1030
01:00:59.901 --> 01:01:00.734
<v Speaker 1>belief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a ritual to instantiate embodied </v>

1031
01:01:03.501 --> 01:01:04.334
<v Speaker 1>transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to become what that </v>

1032
01:01:05.991 --> 01:01:06.824
<v Speaker 1>represents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Question is what the hell does it </v>

1033
01:01:08.661 --> 01:01:10.100
<v Speaker 1>represent?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we know?</v>

1034
01:01:10.101 --> 01:01:11.870
<v Speaker 1>Some of that it represents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1035
01:01:11.871 --> 01:01:12.704
<v Speaker 1>the ability to pay attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing that for sure it </v>

1036
01:01:15.051 --> 01:01:19.100
<v Speaker 1>represents because Christ is an analog </v>
<v Speaker 1>of of Horus,</v>

1037
01:01:19.490 --> 01:01:21.740
<v Speaker 1>a very tight analog horse as a matter of</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact.</v>

1038
01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:24.470
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what else does it represent?</v>

1039
01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:27.830
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can give you some other suggestions.</v>

1040
01:01:27.830 --> 01:01:28.663
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that is often required</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the believer in a traditional </v>

1041
01:01:33.951 --> 01:01:34.784
<v Speaker 1>religion is a pilgrimage right now that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was quite common in Christianity in the </v>

1042
01:01:39.170 --> 01:01:40.340
<v Speaker 1>Middle Ages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of disappeared.</v>

1043
01:01:40.610 --> 01:01:41.443
<v Speaker 1>You see bits and pieces of it in Judaism</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the idea of modern Judaism in </v>

1044
01:01:44.601 --> 01:01:45.434
<v Speaker 1>particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the idea that every North American </v>

1045
01:01:47.451 --> 01:01:48.290
<v Speaker 1>Jew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1046
01:01:48.291 --> 01:01:53.291
<v Speaker 1>she'd go to Israel at least once and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then of course it's a massively featured</v>

1047
01:01:53.870 --> 01:01:56.030
<v Speaker 1>element of tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>traditional Islam.</v>

1048
01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:57.021
<v Speaker 1>So you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1049
01:01:57.021 --> 01:01:59.600
<v Speaker 1>what does a pilgrimage dude is someone?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1050
01:01:59.601 --> 01:02:02.490
<v Speaker 1>partly it's a journey to the holy city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever that means.</v>

1051
01:02:02.530 --> 01:02:03.363
<v Speaker 1>The holy city is a symbolic </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation of an ideal mode of </v>

1052
01:02:06.331 --> 01:02:07.790
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're.</v>

1053
01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.510
<v Speaker 1>You're making a symbolic journey to an </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideal mode of being.</v>

1054
01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:12.351
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1055
01:02:12.351 --> 01:02:13.184
<v Speaker 1>let's say you're some ratty villager </v>
<v Speaker 1>from somewhere and you've never been </v>

1056
01:02:15.501 --> 01:02:18.650
<v Speaker 1>more than a mile away from your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from your village,</v>

1057
01:02:18.651 --> 01:02:19.920
<v Speaker 1>and you're functionally illiterate.</v>

1058
01:02:19.950 --> 01:02:22.410
<v Speaker 1>You don't know anything about the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>in one day you decided to,</v>

1059
01:02:22.460 --> 01:02:25.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take up $1,500 or 3000 mile pilgrimage.</v>

1060
01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:27.293
<v Speaker 1>The probability that you're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same person when you come back as </v>

1061
01:02:30.271 --> 01:02:34.020
<v Speaker 1>you were when you left is zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason for that is,</v>

1062
01:02:34.050 --> 01:02:34.883
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of things are gonna happen to you </v>

1063
01:02:35.551 --> 01:02:36.384
<v Speaker 1>along the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God only knows it's gonna be a big </v>

1064
01:02:37.951 --> 01:02:39.750
<v Speaker 1>adventure and you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1065
01:02:39.751 --> 01:02:42.780
<v Speaker 1>what's the utility?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that utility is that,</v>

1066
01:02:43.410 --> 01:02:44.243
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with each stressful situation you </v>

1067
01:02:46.051 --> 01:02:51.051
<v Speaker 1>encounter and master your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your capacity grows,</v>

1068
01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:55.890
<v Speaker 1>and so maybe you'll encounter 500 of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those on your pilgrimage.</v>

1069
01:02:55.950 --> 01:02:56.940
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you don't even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1070
01:02:56.941 --> 01:02:57.774
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's dangerous enough so there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable probability that you won't </v>

1071
01:03:01.171 --> 01:03:03.930
<v Speaker 1>even come back alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you do come back,</v>

1072
01:03:03.931 --> 01:03:06.570
<v Speaker 1>you're not naive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've seen the world.</v>

1073
01:03:06.930 --> 01:03:09.960
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be someone who's much </v>
<v Speaker 1>more difficult to contend with.</v>

1074
01:03:10.490 --> 01:03:11.323
<v Speaker 1>You know when you're going to be a bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a forerunner to the people in your </v>

1075
01:03:13.051 --> 01:03:16.080
<v Speaker 1>village price,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you pay for that member in the hobbit.</v>

1076
01:03:17.130 --> 01:03:21.540
<v Speaker 1>When billable goes out to confront the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dragon,</v>

1077
01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:24.120
<v Speaker 1>then he comes back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one really likes them anymore,</v>

1078
01:03:24.121 --> 01:03:25.950
<v Speaker 1>like they respect them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they think,</v>

1079
01:03:25.951 --> 01:03:26.431
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1080
01:03:26.431 --> 01:03:30.570
<v Speaker 1>here's this weird guy that transformed </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself into like a thief and you know,</v>

1081
01:03:30.571 --> 01:03:33.750
<v Speaker 1>then when confronted a drag and he went </v>
<v Speaker 1>way the hell away from his home,</v>

1082
01:03:33.751 --> 01:03:36.990
<v Speaker 1>so he started contaminated by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>foreigner and he made it back.</v>

1083
01:03:36.991 --> 01:03:37.824
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to mess with him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's not the same thing that he was </v>

1084
01:03:41.731 --> 01:03:44.040
<v Speaker 1>when he was there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1085
01:03:44.041 --> 01:03:44.874
<v Speaker 1>And that's all to the good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean what happens in the next series </v>

1086
01:03:46.951 --> 01:03:47.784
<v Speaker 1>of books that makes it quite evident </v>
<v Speaker 1>that if Bilbo hadn't undergone his </v>

1087
01:03:51.241 --> 01:03:52.074
<v Speaker 1>adventure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than the battle between good and evil </v>

1088
01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:56.340
<v Speaker 1>would have gone to the evil side.</v>

1089
01:03:56.420 --> 01:03:57.253
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the entire plot of the Lord of </v>

1090
01:03:58.981 --> 01:04:02.280
<v Speaker 1>the rings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's this massive fantasy of good versus</v>

1091
01:04:02.281 --> 01:04:03.114
<v Speaker 1>evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like Harry Potter and those things </v>

1092
01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:09.340
<v Speaker 1>like those ideas never go away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see that with the avengers too.</v>

1093
01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:10.800
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

1094
01:04:10.890 --> 01:04:12.360
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

1095
01:04:12.450 --> 01:04:15.210
<v Speaker 1>the one of the scenes in there is </v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely interesting.</v>

1096
01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:18.480
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's this scene,</v>

1097
01:04:18.570 --> 01:04:19.403
<v Speaker 1>this is where the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do they call those foreign alien </v>

1098
01:04:21.211 --> 01:04:23.190
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Qatari or something like that,</v>

1099
01:04:24.210 --> 01:04:25.043
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big monsters that come through the </v>

1100
01:04:26.071 --> 01:04:29.340
<v Speaker 1>portal and then invade New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what they're called,</v>

1101
01:04:29.341 --> 01:04:32.850
<v Speaker 1>but there's a very interesting scene in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there where the,</v>

1102
01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:34.533
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>armed forced to send a hydrogen bomb to </v>

1103
01:04:37.350 --> 01:04:40.710
<v Speaker 1>take New York out because of the descent</v>
<v Speaker 1>of these terrible aliens,</v>

1104
01:04:40.711 --> 01:04:41.544
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And iron man who's this weird android </v>

1105
01:04:44.850 --> 01:04:45.683
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's a human being that's </v>

1106
01:04:46.321 --> 01:04:49.440
<v Speaker 1>transforming himself into something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's more than a human being.</v>

1107
01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:50.753
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that happens with iron</v>
<v Speaker 1>man suit gets increasingly gold as the </v>

1108
01:04:54.630 --> 01:04:57.030
<v Speaker 1>series continues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a real reason for that.</v>

1109
01:04:58.380 --> 01:05:01.500
<v Speaker 1>He makes a personal sacrifice to avert </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hydrogen bomb,</v>

1110
01:05:01.501 --> 01:05:02.334
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it blows up all the bad guys </v>

1111
01:05:03.361 --> 01:05:06.450
<v Speaker 1>and he falls to Earth just like ICARUS.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's pretty cool.</v>

1112
01:05:06.930 --> 01:05:07.763
<v Speaker 1>And then what's really interesting is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that when he falls to earth and he's </v>

1113
01:05:11.551 --> 01:05:14.730
<v Speaker 1>dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the whole or wakes them up.</v>

1114
01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:16.433
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hulk represents masculine energy that's </v>

1115
01:05:19.721 --> 01:05:21.710
<v Speaker 1>completely unbound,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1116
01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:22.593
<v Speaker 1>And then Tony Stark is this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>tightly constrained intellect character </v>

1117
01:05:25.690 --> 01:05:29.140
<v Speaker 1>who's half machine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not enough savage,</v>

1118
01:05:29.141 --> 01:05:32.020
<v Speaker 1>that's one way of looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when he's lying there half dead,</v>

1119
01:05:32.021 --> 01:05:32.854
<v Speaker 1>he's missing something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the whole comes along and like </v>

1120
01:05:34.610 --> 01:05:35.443
<v Speaker 1>yelled at them into being again and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>already made a relationship with the </v>

1121
01:05:38.261 --> 01:05:39.094
<v Speaker 1>hulk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1122
01:05:39.550 --> 01:05:40.383
<v Speaker 1>And these things are genuine myths </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're cocreated with their </v>

1123
01:05:44.681 --> 01:05:45.540
<v Speaker 1>audience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1124
01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:46.413
<v Speaker 1>all of these stories has a backstory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're a comic book writer and </v>

1125
01:05:49.571 --> 01:05:52.120
<v Speaker 1>you deviate improperly from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>backstory,</v>

1126
01:05:52.121 --> 01:05:54.400
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to get like 10,000 </v>
<v Speaker 1>letters from fans.</v>

1127
01:05:54.401 --> 01:05:54.971
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1128
01:05:54.971 --> 01:05:58.360
<v Speaker 1>what about issue 118 on page 13?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1129
01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:00.400
<v Speaker 1>that's part of the necessary plot.</v>

1130
01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:01.733
<v Speaker 2>Well</v>

1131
01:06:08.810 --> 01:06:12.330
<v Speaker 1>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep Tony Stark in mind for a minute.</v>

1132
01:06:12.900 --> 01:06:13.733
<v Speaker 1>Now you see this labyrinth here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'll tell you what you do in the </v>

1133
01:06:16.820 --> 01:06:18.180
<v Speaker 1>Shark Cathedral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've got this cross.</v>

1134
01:06:18.450 --> 01:06:20.220
<v Speaker 1>And then this thing is at the point of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1135
01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:22.950
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go on a pilgrimage,</v>

1136
01:06:23.070 --> 01:06:23.903
<v Speaker 1>you go out there and expand your </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality by visiting the north part </v>

1137
01:06:26.791 --> 01:06:29.370
<v Speaker 1>of the world in the west part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world of the east part of the world,</v>

1138
01:06:29.371 --> 01:06:30.204
<v Speaker 1>in the south part of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go everywhere you are a wanderer </v>

1139
01:06:32.521 --> 01:06:34.680
<v Speaker 1>that's gone everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1140
01:06:34.681 --> 01:06:37.680
<v Speaker 1>but maybe you can go to the damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>pilgrimage for one reason or another,</v>

1141
01:06:37.681 --> 01:06:38.514
<v Speaker 1>so you do a symbolic pilgrimage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She'd go to the cathedral and you go to </v>

1142
01:06:41.431 --> 01:06:43.410
<v Speaker 1>the point of suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

1143
01:06:43.411 --> 01:06:47.190
<v Speaker 1>and then you enter this maze and to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the middle of the maze,</v>

1144
01:06:47.430 --> 01:06:51.090
<v Speaker 1>which is very much like the Buddha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the flower of the that the Buddhist sits</v>

1145
01:06:51.091 --> 01:06:53.580
<v Speaker 1>in because it's a flower to get to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle,</v>

1146
01:06:54.030 --> 01:06:55.620
<v Speaker 1>you can't just walk straight to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle.</v>

1147
01:06:56.070 --> 01:06:56.903
<v Speaker 1>You have to wonder the entire maze and </v>
<v Speaker 1>cover every square foot of it and only </v>

1148
01:07:02.851 --> 01:07:05.700
<v Speaker 1>once you've done that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's a symbolic journey to north,</v>

1149
01:07:05.820 --> 01:07:06.541
<v Speaker 1>east,</v>
<v Speaker 1>west,</v>

1150
01:07:06.541 --> 01:07:08.730
<v Speaker 1>and south.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only after you've done that,</v>

1151
01:07:08.731 --> 01:07:09.564
<v Speaker 1>do you get to the middle and the middle </v>
<v Speaker 1>signifies the point where the suffering </v>

1152
01:07:13.351 --> 01:07:16.350
<v Speaker 1>that's represented by the entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure of that building.</v>

1153
01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:17.513
<v Speaker 1>Can Be with stood and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to understand this idea is so </v>

1154
01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:24.173
<v Speaker 1>you think about what those damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>Europeans were doing when they were </v>

1155
01:07:26.341 --> 01:07:28.830
<v Speaker 1>building those cathedrals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1156
01:07:28.860 --> 01:07:31.590
<v Speaker 1>some of those things took 500 years to </v>
<v Speaker 1>build.</v>

1157
01:07:32.100 --> 01:07:32.933
<v Speaker 1>You can't even imagine a modern society </v>
<v Speaker 1>building something that would take 500 </v>

1158
01:07:36.601 --> 01:07:37.890
<v Speaker 1>years to build,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1159
01:07:38.090 --> 01:07:40.530
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's unimaginable to us.</v>

1160
01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:43.800
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and these cathedrals were so expensive.</v>

1161
01:07:43.830 --> 01:07:47.460
<v Speaker 1>They were like the moon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the trip to the moon in the 19 sixties,</v>

1162
01:07:47.461 --> 01:07:48.294
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole damn culture was devoted to </v>

1163
01:07:50.371 --> 01:07:51.204
<v Speaker 1>producing these fantastic structures of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stone in light that had this particular </v>

1164
01:07:55.771 --> 01:07:57.240
<v Speaker 1>message embodied in it.</v>

1165
01:07:57.390 --> 01:07:59.130
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why were they doing that?</v>

1166
01:07:59.580 --> 01:08:00.031
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1167
01:08:00.031 --> 01:08:00.864
<v Speaker 1>you can get cynical about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I think that'd be a little </v>

1168
01:08:03.151 --> 01:08:06.400
<v Speaker 1>premature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is part of the answer.</v>

1169
01:08:06.401 --> 01:08:07.234
<v Speaker 1>It's like the culture was trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure something out and what they were </v>

1170
01:08:10.621 --> 01:08:14.850
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out is where you should</v>
<v Speaker 1>be and how you should get there.</v>

1171
01:08:15.530 --> 01:08:16.130
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1172
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:16.963
<v Speaker 1>and to point out as well how massive the</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences were of failure versus </v>

1173
01:08:21.201 --> 01:08:22.034
<v Speaker 1>success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because failure that leads to hell and </v>

1174
01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:25.333
<v Speaker 1>success that leads to heaven and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know you can think about that as </v>

1175
01:08:27.501 --> 01:08:31.760
<v Speaker 1>something projected into the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the future life which nature called</v>

1176
01:08:31.761 --> 01:08:33.830
<v Speaker 1>the biggest error Christianity ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>made.</v>

1177
01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:37.670
<v Speaker 1>But if you dispense with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least provisionally,</v>

1178
01:08:38.060 --> 01:08:40.460
<v Speaker 1>you know the reality of that becomes </v>
<v Speaker 1>clear right away.</v>

1179
01:08:40.730 --> 01:08:41.563
<v Speaker 1>What happens if you don't take the </v>
<v Speaker 1>voyage while you become corrupt as your </v>

1180
01:08:45.501 --> 01:08:48.170
<v Speaker 1>week?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's as simple as that.</v>

1181
01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:51.200
<v Speaker 1>And as soon as you and you have every </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason to become corrupt,</v>

1182
01:08:51.201 --> 01:08:52.034
<v Speaker 1>like you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the conditions of existence are such </v>

1183
01:08:54.590 --> 01:08:57.620
<v Speaker 1>that if you cannot tolerate them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will become corrupt.</v>

1184
01:08:59.060 --> 01:09:00.890
<v Speaker 2>And I just,</v>

1185
01:09:02.090 --> 01:09:07.090
<v Speaker 1>I just can't see in any way how that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not self evidently true.</v>

1186
01:09:08.930 --> 01:09:09.763
<v Speaker 1>And so if you don't take the voyage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what happens is everything tilts </v>

1187
01:09:13.071 --> 01:09:13.904
<v Speaker 1>towards hell around you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have a lot more influenced than </v>

1188
01:09:16.881 --> 01:09:17.714
<v Speaker 1>you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you don't know exactly what waves of </v>

1189
01:09:20.691 --> 01:09:22.890
<v Speaker 1>causality or emanating from your </v>
<v Speaker 1>decision.</v>

1190
01:09:22.891 --> 01:09:25.070
<v Speaker 1>So you have no idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1191
01:09:25.071 --> 01:09:25.904
<v Speaker 1>And then if you do just start to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere and to pick up your </v>

1192
01:09:29.091 --> 01:09:32.980
<v Speaker 1>responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then what emanates out from Jojo.</v>

1193
01:09:32.981 --> 01:09:33.814
<v Speaker 1>And no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe in receiving waves is the idea </v>

1194
01:09:35.931 --> 01:09:39.230
<v Speaker 1>that it's possible to live life properly</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to make things better.</v>

1195
01:09:40.610 --> 01:09:41.443
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

1196
01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:42.913
<v Speaker 1>that's an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I think that idea is more powerful </v>

1197
01:09:45.561 --> 01:09:46.394
<v Speaker 1>than death</v>

1198
01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:50.860
<v Speaker 1>and it would be really good if that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>the case.</v>

1199
01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:51.953
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they existential element comes in and I </v>

1200
01:09:53.301 --> 01:09:54.134
<v Speaker 1>guess this is also the element of faith </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the only way you're going to ever </v>

1201
01:09:56.151 --> 01:09:59.990
<v Speaker 1>figure that out is if you try it because</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one else can demonstrate,</v>

1202
01:10:00.020 --> 01:10:00.853
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth or falsity of those two </v>

1203
01:10:02.601 --> 01:10:07.601
<v Speaker 1>branching pathways except you because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to test it in the conditions of</v>

1204
01:10:07.791 --> 01:10:09.470
<v Speaker 1>your own life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

1205
01:10:09.471 --> 01:10:12.590
<v Speaker 1>And at some point by the time you hit </v>
<v Speaker 1>about 30,</v>

1206
01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:16.160
<v Speaker 1>nobody can tell you what to do and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

1207
01:10:16.161 --> 01:10:16.994
<v Speaker 1>well hooray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like let's go a little easy on the </v>

1208
01:10:19.281 --> 01:10:20.240
<v Speaker 1>celebrating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1209
01:10:20.241 --> 01:10:21.074
<v Speaker 1>it's quite a relief when you have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem and you can go to someone and </v>

1210
01:10:23.271 --> 01:10:25.040
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well here's what you can do about it.</v>

1211
01:10:25.460 --> 01:10:30.460
<v Speaker 1>But by the time you're fully adult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your damn life is so individualized that</v>

1212
01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:35.660
<v Speaker 1>you know you can use moral guidelines </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you should for sure,</v>

1213
01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:40.190
<v Speaker 1>but you're basically stuck with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>choices.</v>

1214
01:10:42.750 --> 01:10:44.850
<v Speaker 1>All these old ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They suggest that</v>

1215
01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:51.540
<v Speaker 1>if your choice is to voluntarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>confront and to improve and to repair,</v>

1216
01:10:51.990 --> 01:10:54.960
<v Speaker 1>that not only do you repair the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>around you,</v>

1217
01:10:54.990 --> 01:10:55.823
<v Speaker 1>they don't have to be within you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can be anywhere around you and you </v>

1218
01:10:58.830 --> 01:11:02.940
<v Speaker 1>continually healed the structure of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being well.</v>

1219
01:11:03.690 --> 01:11:07.890
<v Speaker 1>That'd be a good thing to try.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know it's a big deal.</v>

1220
01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:12.600
<v Speaker 1>It'll keep you busy in all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll provide you're suffering with some</v>

1221
01:11:12.601 --> 01:11:13.434
<v Speaker 1>meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big deal and the alternative </v>

1222
01:11:17.131 --> 01:11:18.300
<v Speaker 1>looks dreadful.</v>

1223
01:11:23.670 --> 01:11:24.270
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1224
01:11:24.270 --> 01:11:26.460
<v Speaker 1>I walked you through all these various </v>
<v Speaker 1>theories,</v>

1225
01:11:26.461 --> 01:11:27.294
<v Speaker 1>some of them about behavior and some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them about personality and some of them </v>

1226
01:11:30.941 --> 01:11:33.700
<v Speaker 1>have both philosophy and some of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>about clinical psychology.</v>

1227
01:11:33.701 --> 01:11:34.534
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it's an attempt to to allow you to </v>

1228
01:11:38.001 --> 01:11:41.690
<v Speaker 1>take multiple snapshots of what a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a human being is,</v>

1229
01:11:41.691 --> 01:11:45.230
<v Speaker 1>and you know how we might manifest </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves.</v>

1230
01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:46.873
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing all those things has been </v>

1231
01:11:47.691 --> 01:11:50.630
<v Speaker 1>ridiculously useful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculously useful.</v>

1232
01:11:50.690 --> 01:11:53.210
<v Speaker 1>Far More practical than anything else I </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever learned,</v>

1233
01:11:54.330 --> 01:11:55.163
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the advantages to knowing </v>

1234
01:11:57.201 --> 01:11:59.160
<v Speaker 1>about personality is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1235
01:11:59.210 --> 01:12:02.810
<v Speaker 1>instead of reducing the individual to </v>
<v Speaker 1>some set of measurable phenomenon,</v>

1236
01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:03.793
<v Speaker 1>which I'm all for by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it also expands your conception of what </v>

1237
01:12:07.551 --> 01:12:11.510
<v Speaker 1>the individual can be to an almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>unlimited degree,</v>

1238
01:12:12.550 --> 01:12:14.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so instead of something like,</v>

1239
01:12:14.930 --> 01:12:15.763
<v Speaker 1>instead of a human being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some being something that has to waiver </v>

1240
01:12:18.261 --> 01:12:20.780
<v Speaker 1>and be crushed under the weight of its </v>
<v Speaker 1>own being,</v>

1241
01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:22.033
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a human being could easily be something </v>

1242
01:12:23.031 --> 01:12:24.500
<v Speaker 1>that could stand up and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1243
01:12:24.570 --> 01:12:29.460
<v Speaker 1>well I can handle that and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>people can do that.</v>

1244
01:12:29.610 --> 01:12:32.850
<v Speaker 1>People are so damn tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievable.</v>

1245
01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:34.183
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen people go through things that </v>

1246
01:12:35.221 --> 01:12:36.054
<v Speaker 1>are just grinding terrible and</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only come out the other side but </v>

1247
01:12:41.941 --> 01:12:42.774
<v Speaker 1>actually put themselves together enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>to clearly be a forest that rescues the </v>

1248
01:12:47.771 --> 01:12:49.730
<v Speaker 1>culture and tries to improve the </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>

1249
01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:53.040
<v Speaker 1>And so like Ray,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for us,</v>

1250
01:12:53.070 --> 01:12:56.550
<v Speaker 1>if we could do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not more than justifies whatever,</v>

1251
01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:58.673
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>horror horrors might be laid at our </v>

1252
01:12:59.770 --> 01:13:02.700
<v Speaker 1>collect at our collective feet.</v>

1253
01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:08.870
<v Speaker 1>So I would say don't underestimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

1254
01:13:09.950 --> 01:13:10.783
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you guys all have a lot going for </v>

1255
01:13:13.101 --> 01:13:13.850
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1256
01:13:13.850 --> 01:13:16.220
<v Speaker 1>you're smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're young,</v>

1257
01:13:16.730 --> 01:13:21.730
<v Speaker 1>you're reasonably conscientious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and number of viewers are creative.</v>

1258
01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:24.073
<v Speaker 1>You have access,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendous access to technological </v>

1259

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1261
01:13:32.301 --> 01:13:33.134
<v Speaker 1>next 30 years or so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the more people that try to make </v>

1262
01:13:36.891 --> 01:13:39.470
<v Speaker 1>things better consciously rather than </v>
