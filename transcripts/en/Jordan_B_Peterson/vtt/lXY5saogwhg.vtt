1
00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:02.803
<v Speaker 1>So the first question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would you define self deception and </v>

2
00:00:06.061 --> 00:00:08.640
<v Speaker 1>how is that different from say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitive dissonance?</v>

3
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:09.301
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll,</v>

4
00:00:09.301 --> 00:00:11.970
<v Speaker 1>we'll start with the first one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How would you define self deception?</v>

5
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.750
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in most accounts of self deception,</v>

6
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.093
<v Speaker 1>most accounts of self deception have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been basically formulated by logicians </v>

7
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:22.943
<v Speaker 1>and the logicians make a presumption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the presumption is essentially that </v>

8
00:00:26.731 --> 00:00:29.250
<v Speaker 1>people think in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

9
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.230
<v Speaker 1>in fully articulated statements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>propositions you might say.</v>

10
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.093
<v Speaker 1>And as soon as you accept that you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>run into the paradoxes of self </v>

11
00:00:38.191 --> 00:00:39.690
<v Speaker 1>deception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

12
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.943
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't necessarily seem possible to </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe proposition a and proposition b </v>

13
00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:46.044
<v Speaker 1>at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those would be stateable pro </v>

14
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.640
<v Speaker 1>propositions if they conflict with one </v>
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>

15
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.590
<v Speaker 1>But that begs a number of questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one is first,</v>

16
00:00:55.591 --> 00:00:56.424
<v Speaker 1>whether or not people think in </v>
<v Speaker 1>propositions in fully articulated </v>

17
00:00:59.821 --> 00:01:02.520
<v Speaker 1>propositions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which they do,</v>

18
00:01:02.521 --> 00:01:03.960
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the only way they think.</v>

19
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.700
<v Speaker 1>And then also what does it mean for two </v>
<v Speaker 1>things to con conflict?</v>

20
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.380
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to start with the second </v>
<v Speaker 1>answering the second question first.</v>

21
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.330
<v Speaker 1>So often when I've read badly written </v>
<v Speaker 1>essays,</v>

22
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.463
<v Speaker 1>often undergraduate essays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that occurs very </v>

23
00:01:23.281 --> 00:01:28.281
<v Speaker 1>frequently is that the writer will make </v>
<v Speaker 1>a statement on page one or paragraph one</v>

24
00:01:28.801 --> 00:01:29.634
<v Speaker 1>and then two paragraphs later write a </v>
<v Speaker 1>statement that directly contradicts the </v>

25
00:01:34.291 --> 00:01:35.124
<v Speaker 1>first statement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because their thinking is confused </v>

26
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.193
<v Speaker 1>because they're young and because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know how to write and aren't </v>

27
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.853
<v Speaker 1>particularly careful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't notice that the two </v>

28
00:01:46.591 --> 00:01:49.320
<v Speaker 1>propositions actually are illogical </v>
<v Speaker 1>conflict.</v>

29
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:50.663
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that indicates is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people actually don't know this </v>

30
00:01:53.161 --> 00:01:57.150
<v Speaker 1>when things are in logical conflict </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's no marker for that.</v>

31
00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.860
<v Speaker 1>The only time people notice that their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

32
00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:02.563
<v Speaker 1>their presuppositions about the world or</v>
<v Speaker 1>in conflict is when they try to act out </v>

33
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.553
<v Speaker 1>two contradictory notions at the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and find out that acting one out </v>

34
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.670
<v Speaker 1>interferes with acting another route.</v>

35
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.870
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes that happens because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're in conflict with themselves.</v>

36
00:02:18.871 --> 00:02:22.260
<v Speaker 1>But even more often it happens because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they become,</v>

37
00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.360
<v Speaker 1>they enter into conflict with someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

38
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.913
<v Speaker 1>So you might say that you don't even </v>
<v Speaker 1>notice you're propositional conflicts </v>

39
00:02:28.261 --> 00:02:30.180
<v Speaker 1>until you act them out in the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>stops you.</v>

40
00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:31.703
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

41
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.500
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can,</v>

42
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.363
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can maintain contradictory </v>

43
00:02:38.461 --> 00:02:39.294
<v Speaker 1>cognitions endlessly without ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>noticing how disorganized you are </v>

44
00:02:43.741 --> 00:02:47.580
<v Speaker 1>because the world doesn't slap you in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the face for your foolishness unless you</v>

45
00:02:47.581 --> 00:02:48.414
<v Speaker 1>try to act those things out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea that self deception is </v>

46
00:02:52.981 --> 00:02:53.814
<v Speaker 1>impossible because people can't hold two</v>
<v Speaker 1>contradictory propositions </v>

47
00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.790
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's completely ridiculous.</v>

48
00:03:00.791 --> 00:03:02.780
<v Speaker 1>People do that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

49
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.013
<v Speaker 1>so then that's the answer to the second </v>
<v Speaker 1>question and the answer to the first </v>

50
00:03:08.381 --> 00:03:11.050
<v Speaker 1>question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

51
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.980
<v Speaker 1>the way that people generally deceive </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves is that they act out a series</v>

52
00:03:17.981 --> 00:03:18.814
<v Speaker 1>of propositions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So say a series of beliefs about the </v>

53
00:03:20.441 --> 00:03:22.090
<v Speaker 1>world or even one belief about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

54
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:23.373
<v Speaker 1>And then they run into evidence that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that inactive belief is not having the </v>

55
00:03:29.051 --> 00:03:29.884
<v Speaker 1>results desired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say you tell a joke at a party </v>

56
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.143
<v Speaker 1>and no one laughs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And your proposition was that the joke </v>

57
00:03:40.121 --> 00:03:43.300
<v Speaker 1>was funny and obviously the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>indicated to you that</v>

58
00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.980
<v Speaker 1>something about that proposition was </v>
<v Speaker 1>faulty.</v>

59
00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:50.263
<v Speaker 1>Now the problem is in part that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world doesn't tell you which part of </v>

60
00:03:53.631 --> 00:03:54.464
<v Speaker 1>that proposition is wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just tells you that the frame of </v>

61
00:03:58.041 --> 00:03:58.874
<v Speaker 1>reference that you were using when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were telling the joke had something </v>

62
00:04:03.081 --> 00:04:03.914
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had something about it that was </v>

63
00:04:05.361 --> 00:04:08.600
<v Speaker 1>sufficiently erroneous so that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't get the result that was intended.</v>

64
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.690
<v Speaker 1>But that's subject to all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential interpretations.</v>

65
00:04:11.691 --> 00:04:12.524
<v Speaker 1>And so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a situation where a classic </v>

66
00:04:14.691 --> 00:04:16.820
<v Speaker 1>situation where the,</v>

67
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.620
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

68
00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:19.453
<v Speaker 1>the data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the outcome of your joke is </v>

69
00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:24.290
<v Speaker 1>insufficiently.</v>

70
00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:30.163
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

71
00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.950
<v Speaker 1>Informative to precisely indicate to you</v>
<v Speaker 1>where that your mistake was made.</v>

72
00:04:35.951 --> 00:04:38.350
<v Speaker 1>So it's subject to all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential interpretations.</v>

73
00:04:38.351 --> 00:04:39.184
<v Speaker 1>And one interpretation could be all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these people at this party are too </v>

74
00:04:42.221 --> 00:04:43.054
<v Speaker 1>stupid to understand my humor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a perfectly reasonable </v>

75
00:04:46.001 --> 00:04:48.220
<v Speaker 1>proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although it's unlikely to be true.</v>

76
00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.893
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>generally what people do when they </v>

77
00:04:50.981 --> 00:04:55.981
<v Speaker 1>deceived themselves is that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they lay forth a belief in the world and</v>

78
00:04:57.701 --> 00:04:58.534
<v Speaker 1>the results aren't what they intended.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that produces a negative emotional </v>

79
00:05:01.631 --> 00:05:02.464
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the negative emotional state </v>

80
00:05:04.241 --> 00:05:05.074
<v Speaker 1>indicates an error.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then there's a whole process of </v>

81
00:05:06.911 --> 00:05:07.744
<v Speaker 1>exploration that has to occur to </v>
<v Speaker 1>precisely specify the error and to </v>

82
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:11.703
<v Speaker 1>precisely specify how the information </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the error could be used to revamp </v>

83
00:05:16.391 --> 00:05:17.224
<v Speaker 1>the whole propositional sequence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that takes a tremendous amount of </v>

84
00:05:20.531 --> 00:05:21.364
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like ridiculous amount of work because </v>

85
00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.390
<v Speaker 1>let's say people don't laugh at your </v>
<v Speaker 1>jokes.</v>

86
00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:26.493
<v Speaker 1>While why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well maybe you're hanging around with </v>

87
00:05:28.331 --> 00:05:29.164
<v Speaker 1>the wrong sort of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe your jokes just aren't that </v>

88
00:05:32.291 --> 00:05:33.124
<v Speaker 1>funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe you're kind of a jerk or maybe </v>

89
00:05:34.781 --> 00:05:37.060
<v Speaker 1>you don't know anything about social </v>
<v Speaker 1>interaction.</v>

90
00:05:37.061 --> 00:05:41.020
<v Speaker 1>And all of those possibilities emerge </v>
<v Speaker 1>when your joke falls flat.</v>

91
00:05:41.021 --> 00:05:46.021
<v Speaker 1>And in order for you to fully </v>
<v Speaker 1>investigate the consequences of that,</v>

92
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.000
<v Speaker 1>you have to do a tremendous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitive work.</v>

93
00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:52.450
<v Speaker 1>And so generally what happens is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people just don't do the work.</v>

94
00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.920
<v Speaker 1>And then what they do is they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

95
00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.170
<v Speaker 1>they have as a representation of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>failure.</v>

96
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:01.333
<v Speaker 1>What you might describe as what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>might describe as an it counter with </v>

97
00:06:04.461 --> 00:06:09.110
<v Speaker 1>chaos and the encounter is negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion,</v>

98
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:10.663
<v Speaker 1>emergency preparation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then complete indeterminacy as to </v>

99
00:06:14.361 --> 00:06:16.730
<v Speaker 1>the proposition of nature of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

100
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:20.960
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you do that enough times,</v>

101
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.033
<v Speaker 1>so you lay out your beliefs and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>fail and you get a negative emotional </v>

102
00:06:25.611 --> 00:06:26.444
<v Speaker 1>response personally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you fail to engage in the difficult </v>

103
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.280
<v Speaker 1>process of exploration to specify </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly what went wrong.</v>

104
00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.113
<v Speaker 1>What will happen is that you'll collect </v>
<v Speaker 1>around yourself and absolute morass of </v>

105
00:06:38.661 --> 00:06:39.494
<v Speaker 1>chaotic and indeterminant experienced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the place that you will end </v>

106
00:06:43.941 --> 00:06:44.774
<v Speaker 1>up living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what self deception really </v>

107
00:06:46.521 --> 00:06:48.770
<v Speaker 1>looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't look like you believe a and b</v>

108
00:06:48.771 --> 00:06:50.950
<v Speaker 1>at the same time and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

109
00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.110
<v Speaker 1>you don't notice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's way more complicated than that.</v>

110
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.770
<v Speaker 1>And I would say that's akin to cognitive</v>
<v Speaker 1>dissonance,</v>

111
00:06:57.771 --> 00:06:58.604
<v Speaker 1>but the explanation that I just provided</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far more thorough then the typical </v>

112
00:07:02.811 --> 00:07:05.620
<v Speaker 1>explanation of cognitive dissonance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

113
00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:06.933
<v Speaker 1>so that's an answer to Mike's Question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How would you define self deception and </v>

114
00:07:09.381 --> 00:07:11.420
<v Speaker 1>how was that different from cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>dissonance?</v>

115
00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:22.270
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things you guys might want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do is take more than one question,</v>

116
00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:23.710
<v Speaker 1>don't wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>type of few.</v>

117
00:07:23.711 --> 00:07:26.590
<v Speaker 1>And then I can select from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's people in the room with me here.</v>

118
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:27.783
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which wouldn't be the case under normal </v>

119
00:07:29.621 --> 00:07:31.570
<v Speaker 1>circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're just testing this.</v>

120
00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:37.080
<v Speaker 1>So any other questions?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think some people seek out drama?</v>

121
00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:42.023
<v Speaker 1>Eg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they make things difficult for </v>

122
00:07:42.811 --> 00:07:44.700
<v Speaker 1>themselves because they confuse it with </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning?</v>

123
00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.310
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People do that all the time.</v>

124
00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:48.563
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it because they confuse it with </v>

125
00:07:49.831 --> 00:07:51.840
<v Speaker 1>meaning?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

126
00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:53.460
<v Speaker 1>Partly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

127
00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:56.243
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a really complicated question </v>

128
00:07:57.241 --> 00:07:58.074
<v Speaker 1>that you're asking</v>

129
00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.340
<v Speaker 1>the problem with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

130
00:08:02.341 --> 00:08:03.174
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so imagine that you gave people at </v>

131
00:08:04.561 --> 00:08:09.561
<v Speaker 1>shorts and the choice could be that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>could suffer stupidly or they could live</v>

132
00:08:09.931 --> 00:08:12.510
<v Speaker 1>a meaningful life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you might say,</v>

133
00:08:12.511 --> 00:08:13.344
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously they're going to pick to live </v>

134
00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:15.503
<v Speaker 1>living a meaningful life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not so obvious because one of </v>

135
00:08:18.451 --> 00:08:19.284
<v Speaker 1>the prices that you pay for living a </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningful life is that you have to </v>

136
00:08:23.611 --> 00:08:24.444
<v Speaker 1>adopt responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the responsibility that's attendant </v>

137
00:08:28.111 --> 00:08:32.400
<v Speaker 1>on living a meaningful life might is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is theoretically without limit.</v>

138
00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:33.870
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

139
00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:35.183
<v Speaker 1>what w the ways that's been </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualized in classic Christianity </v>

140
00:08:37.981 --> 00:08:40.380
<v Speaker 1>is that in order to lead a meaningful </v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

141
00:08:40.381 --> 00:08:43.200
<v Speaker 1>you have to take the world's sins onto </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

142
00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:44.663
<v Speaker 1>And that means that you have to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside yourself all of the negative </v>

143
00:08:47.881 --> 00:08:50.410
<v Speaker 1>potentiality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're characterized that,</v>

144
00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:53.610
<v Speaker 1>that that being human is characterized </v>
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>

145
00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:57.150
<v Speaker 1>and then you have to take for addressing</v>
<v Speaker 1>those.</v>

146
00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:59.550
<v Speaker 1>And so when Carl Jung talked about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

147
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:00.713
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the points he made was that if </v>

148
00:09:01.861 --> 00:09:04.650
<v Speaker 1>you do a thorough announced </v>
<v Speaker 1>investigation into your own faults,</v>

149
00:09:04.651 --> 00:09:07.170
<v Speaker 1>then you end up scouring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the word?</v>

150
00:09:07.171 --> 00:09:09.810
<v Speaker 1>It's not scouring precisely harrowing </v>
<v Speaker 1>hell,</v>

151
00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:12.990
<v Speaker 1>literally as close to literally as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>might imagine.</v>

152
00:09:12.991 --> 00:09:14.400
<v Speaker 1>And of course that's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

153
00:09:14.401 --> 00:09:17.520
<v Speaker 1>very unpleasant experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then you might say,</v>

154
00:09:17.521 --> 00:09:18.354
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are going to perfectly well and </v>

155
00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:25.440
<v Speaker 1>logically want to avoid that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they do that using all sorts of</v>

156
00:09:25.441 --> 00:09:26.274
<v Speaker 1>subterfuge because they don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>admit to themselves that they're not </v>

157
00:09:28.801 --> 00:09:29.634
<v Speaker 1>taking any responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they'll often generates false crises </v>

158
00:09:32.491 --> 00:09:33.324
<v Speaker 1>in their own life and amplified problems</v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond necessity so that they can </v>

159
00:09:37.201 --> 00:09:38.034
<v Speaker 1>convince themselves that when they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>effortfully struggling through all that </v>

160
00:09:41.071 --> 00:09:41.904
<v Speaker 1>mess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're actually taking </v>

161
00:09:42.421 --> 00:09:44.340
<v Speaker 1>responsibility for their lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not.</v>

162
00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:46.103
<v Speaker 1>And so that's one of the reasons that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people might seek out drama and make </v>

163
00:09:49.831 --> 00:09:50.664
<v Speaker 1>things difficult for themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's partly because they confuse it </v>

164
00:09:55.151 --> 00:09:57.770
<v Speaker 1>with meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know there's multiple levels of,</v>

165
00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:02.960
<v Speaker 1>of horrible self deception and confusion</v>
<v Speaker 1>and avoidance that go along with that.</v>

166
00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:10.960
<v Speaker 1>What role do you think diagnosis should </v>
<v Speaker 1>play in clinical practice?</v>

167
00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:11.940
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's easy.</v>

168
00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:17.020
<v Speaker 1>You needed to to get reimbursed by </v>
<v Speaker 1>insurance providers and that's about it.</v>

169
00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:22.590
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't say that because that's just</v>
<v Speaker 1>beating fast style.</v>

170
00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:25.930
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a variety of functions,</v>

171
00:10:25.931 --> 00:10:26.764
<v Speaker 1>diagnosis place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of part of engaging in the process </v>

172
00:10:31.601 --> 00:10:32.434
<v Speaker 1>of diagnosis is utilizing classification</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you need to utilize stable </v>

173
00:10:37.871 --> 00:10:40.930
<v Speaker 1>classifications for a number of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them is that</v>

174
00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:43.773
<v Speaker 1>you can't understand anything about what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with without classifying </v>

175
00:10:47.861 --> 00:10:50.800
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even if you classify it incorrectly,</v>

176
00:10:50.801 --> 00:10:53.050
<v Speaker 1>that might be better than not </v>
<v Speaker 1>classifying it all.</v>

177
00:10:53.051 --> 00:10:55.990
<v Speaker 1>Because once it's classified </v>
<v Speaker 1>incorrectly,</v>

178
00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:56.853
<v Speaker 1>you might at least be able to notice </v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically what's incorrect about the </v>

179
00:11:00.911 --> 00:11:01.744
<v Speaker 1>classification and then rectify it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to say that a bad theory might </v>

180
00:11:04.601 --> 00:11:05.434
<v Speaker 1>be better than no theory at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But diagnosis also helps you identify </v>

181
00:11:09.851 --> 00:11:11.380
<v Speaker 1>potential pathways forward.</v>

182
00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:14.050
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you diagnose someone as agoraphobic,</v>

183
00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:19.320
<v Speaker 1>then you have access to the large wealth</v>
<v Speaker 1>of treatment protocols that have already</v>

184
00:11:20.891 --> 00:11:23.350
<v Speaker 1>been developed for ag or phobia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's for useful.</v>

185
00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:24.663
<v Speaker 1>It helps you rule out other things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that can be extremely important </v>

186
00:11:27.731 --> 00:11:28.564
<v Speaker 1>because sometimes someone will come to </v>
<v Speaker 1>see you in a clinical practice and </v>

187
00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:33.460
<v Speaker 1>they're just overwhelmed by what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening to them.</v>

188
00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:36.220
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is that they're in </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos,</v>

189
00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:38.260
<v Speaker 1>they're suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they have no idea why.</v>

190
00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:40.000
<v Speaker 1>And then you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well yeah,</v>

191
00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:41.163
<v Speaker 1>what's happening to you is horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's precisely this kind of </v>

192
00:11:43.451 --> 00:11:44.284
<v Speaker 1>horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and here's what this kind of horrible </v>

193
00:11:47.531 --> 00:11:49.270
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and here's what you can do about it.</v>

194
00:11:49.271 --> 00:11:50.104
<v Speaker 1>And here is a bunch of other people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are also suffering from it and they've </v>

195
00:11:52.541 --> 00:11:56.620
<v Speaker 1>recovered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So with this kind of horrible,</v>

196
00:11:56.621 --> 00:11:58.810
<v Speaker 1>there's all these other things that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>won't have to worry about.</v>

197
00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:01.680
<v Speaker 1>And that's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

198
00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:06.930
<v Speaker 1>that can be really helpful for people </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it narrows the universe of their</v>

199
00:12:07.241 --> 00:12:10.380
<v Speaker 1>problems from all potential problems to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

200
00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:13.210
<v Speaker 1>potentially manageable set of finite </v>
<v Speaker 1>promos.</v>

201
00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:15.460
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the,</v>

202
00:12:15.461 --> 00:12:16.294
<v Speaker 1>so those are some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the reasons for diagnosis and </v>

203
00:12:20.651 --> 00:12:22.930
<v Speaker 1>some of the reasons why diagnosis is </v>
<v Speaker 1>useful.</v>

204
00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:24.363
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you differentiate between having </v>

205
00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:31.810
<v Speaker 1>an actually bad life and having </v>
<v Speaker 1>depression make your life bad?</v>

206
00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:32.920
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good,</v>

207
00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:33.753
<v Speaker 1>that's a good question as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you could do that in a </v>

208
00:12:35.651 --> 00:12:38.860
<v Speaker 1>multidimensional way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>technically speaking.</v>

209
00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:39.641
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

210
00:12:39.641 --> 00:12:40.474
<v Speaker 1>one of the ways I conceptualize that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you imagine people's human life </v>

211
00:12:45.251 --> 00:12:50.251
<v Speaker 1>actually has a fairly stable and </v>
<v Speaker 1>identifiable number of characteristics.</v>

212
00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:54.080
<v Speaker 1>And so some of those are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

213
00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:58.060
<v Speaker 1>you need to engage in trade with other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people in that,</v>

214
00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:02.650
<v Speaker 1>in modern culture that would generally </v>
<v Speaker 1>be formalized as having a career.</v>

215
00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:04.323
<v Speaker 1>You need to have friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to have an intimate </v>

216
00:13:06.761 --> 00:13:09.640
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to be embedded within a family.</v>

217
00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:13.600
<v Speaker 1>You have to conjure up something of high</v>
<v Speaker 1>quality.</v>

218
00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:17.140
<v Speaker 1>That's productive to do with your life </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of work.</v>

219
00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:18.213
<v Speaker 1>You have to attend to your physical and </v>
<v Speaker 1>mental health and you have to regulate </v>

220
00:13:21.491 --> 00:13:25.120
<v Speaker 1>your use of mind altering substances </v>
<v Speaker 1>like drugs and alcohol.</v>

221
00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:26.353
<v Speaker 1>There's other dimensions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those are pretty decent as an </v>

222
00:13:28.211 --> 00:13:30.380
<v Speaker 1>initial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

223
00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:34.270
<v Speaker 1>those serve the purpose quite nicely as </v>
<v Speaker 1>an additional Schema.</v>

224
00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:39.310
<v Speaker 1>So when you're talking to someone in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say in a clinical intake,</v>

225
00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:40.413
<v Speaker 1>the first thing you want to find out is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the person functional on any or all </v>

226
00:13:46.301 --> 00:13:47.134
<v Speaker 1>of those dimensions?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the fewer dimensions on which </v>

227
00:13:49.781 --> 00:13:50.614
<v Speaker 1>they're actually functional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more they just have a bad life and </v>

228
00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:58.050
<v Speaker 1>aren't depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you have no friends and you,</v>

229
00:13:58.990 --> 00:13:59.823
<v Speaker 1>you have no educational history and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly don't have an educational </v>

230
00:14:03.731 --> 00:14:04.564
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say that's commensurate with your </v>

231
00:14:05.291 --> 00:14:09.850
<v Speaker 1>ability or maybe you have no abilities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a patchy work history,</v>

232
00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:12.490
<v Speaker 1>your family is an absolute nightmare.</v>

233
00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:13.953
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

234
00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:17.110
<v Speaker 1>all you do with your time is consumed </v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs and alcohol,</v>

235
00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:18.393
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you have one or more serious </v>

236
00:14:20.051 --> 00:14:22.350
<v Speaker 1>physical or mental health problems you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

237
00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:25.990
<v Speaker 1>your life is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has fallen apart and now you're going to</v>

238
00:14:25.991 --> 00:14:26.824
<v Speaker 1>be suffering because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to call that depression is not </v>

239
00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.860
<v Speaker 1>useful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly depression.</v>

240
00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:33.753
<v Speaker 1>Technically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could spiral you into a place where </v>

241
00:14:36.071 --> 00:14:39.310
<v Speaker 1>those things are more likely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I would generally,</v>

242
00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:40.743
<v Speaker 1>I think it's better to conceptualize </v>
<v Speaker 1>depression as the mismatch between </v>

243
00:14:43.661 --> 00:14:47.350
<v Speaker 1>function and emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I did that,</v>

244
00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:51.410
<v Speaker 1>approximately six dimensional analysis </v>
<v Speaker 1>with someone and I concluded that,</v>

245
00:14:51.411 --> 00:14:52.071
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>

246
00:14:52.071 --> 00:14:54.200
<v Speaker 1>this person has friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

247
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:56.960
<v Speaker 1>they may not be seeing them right now </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they were in a bad state,</v>

248
00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:59.150
<v Speaker 1>but they have friends and the friends </v>
<v Speaker 1>are good for them.</v>

249
00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:01.610
<v Speaker 1>They have an intimate relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's functional.</v>

250
00:15:01.611 --> 00:15:02.444
<v Speaker 1>They have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're embedded within a family that </v>

251
00:15:03.531 --> 00:15:08.531
<v Speaker 1>isn't to pathological.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a job that in principle serves</v>

252
00:15:09.111 --> 00:15:12.020
<v Speaker 1>the function of a job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe that they could even be or had</v>

253
00:15:12.021 --> 00:15:13.730
<v Speaker 1>been interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

254
00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:15.950
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's back.</v>

255
00:15:15.951 --> 00:15:16.784
<v Speaker 1>They're feeling terrible and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>having a difficult time getting out of </v>

256
00:15:18.861 --> 00:15:19.730
<v Speaker 1>bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

257
00:15:19.731 --> 00:15:22.580
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that increases the probability that they</v>

258
00:15:22.581 --> 00:15:25.340
<v Speaker 1>should be accurately conceptualized as </v>
<v Speaker 1>depressed.</v>

259
00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:28.220
<v Speaker 1>And then of course in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a real situation,</v>

260
00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:32.330
<v Speaker 1>the clinical presentation is generally </v>
<v Speaker 1>some mixture of those sorts of things,</v>

261
00:15:32.331 --> 00:15:34.850
<v Speaker 1>but it's very useful to distinguish one </v>
<v Speaker 1>from another.</v>

262
00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:41.700
<v Speaker 1>Have I read Ayn rand and if I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are my thoughts on her philosophy?</v>

263
00:15:42.251 --> 00:15:44.230
<v Speaker 1>Objectivism of objectivism.</v>

264
00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:46.333
<v Speaker 3>MMM,</v>

265
00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:51.940
<v Speaker 1>Ayn rand is an idea log and she's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting in the alarm because she's,</v>

266
00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:53.343
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her ediology runs contrary to the most </v>

267
00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:57.123
<v Speaker 1>prevalent modern ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the one that underlies </v>

268
00:15:58.901 --> 00:16:02.740
<v Speaker 1>political correctness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's fun to read Ayn rand,</v>

269
00:16:02.741 --> 00:16:03.574
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're hyper irritated by </v>
<v Speaker 1>political correctness because she </v>

270
00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:11.050
<v Speaker 1>provides almost the perfect antidote to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

271
00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:13.030
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

272
00:16:13.031 --> 00:16:13.864
<v Speaker 1>I have some sympathy for her because she</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote in a anticommunist vein and she </v>

273
00:16:18.011 --> 00:16:18.844
<v Speaker 1>had her reasons because your family was </v>
<v Speaker 1>chased out of what became the Soviet </v>

274
00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:24.520
<v Speaker 1>Union by the Communists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if I remember correctly,</v>

275
00:16:24.521 --> 00:16:28.000
<v Speaker 1>you had their property stolen and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the terrible things that went along with</v>

276
00:16:28.001 --> 00:16:28.980
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

277
00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:35.460
<v Speaker 1>she writes hero stories of a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>type.</v>

278
00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:39.870
<v Speaker 1>And the hero story is the individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>against the collective,</v>

279
00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:41.730
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

280
00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:46.770
<v Speaker 1>that's a perfectly reasonable hero's </v>
<v Speaker 1>story and it's a useful one.</v>

281
00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:47.963
<v Speaker 1>But to think of that as the only valid </v>
<v Speaker 1>hero story in the constellation of </v>

282
00:16:52.261 --> 00:16:53.094
<v Speaker 1>possible hero stories is a mistake </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can also write a perfectly </v>

283
00:16:57.331 --> 00:16:58.164
<v Speaker 1>good story where the collective is </v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively beneficial and it's the </v>

284
00:17:02.101 --> 00:17:06.000
<v Speaker 1>collective and the hero against say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dire forces of nature.</v>

285
00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:08.550
<v Speaker 1>And that's also a perfectly appropriate </v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

286
00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:09.803
<v Speaker 1>So you might say that there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances under which the attitude </v>

287
00:17:13.561 --> 00:17:17.370
<v Speaker 1>that Ayn rand puts forth is accurate and</v>
<v Speaker 1>salutary.</v>

288
00:17:17.371 --> 00:17:18.204
<v Speaker 1>But to think of that as covering the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire universe of potential proper </v>

289
00:17:22.861 --> 00:17:23.694
<v Speaker 1>narratives is a big mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And usually Ayn rand's acolytes do </v>

290
00:17:27.091 --> 00:17:29.040
<v Speaker 1>precisely that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

291
00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:31.510
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

292
00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:32.343
<v Speaker 1>Ariel says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think all presupposition stem </v>

293
00:17:34.991 --> 00:17:37.570
<v Speaker 1>from religion?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

294
00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:38.673
<v Speaker 1>What I think is that the deepest </v>
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions are identical to </v>

295
00:17:42.011 --> 00:17:43.930
<v Speaker 1>religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That actually when we,</v>

296
00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:46.810
<v Speaker 1>when we talk about what constitutes </v>
<v Speaker 1>religion,</v>

297
00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:47.673
<v Speaker 1>what we are saying at the same is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're dealing with the most fundamental </v>

298
00:17:51.781 --> 00:17:52.614
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions that people make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the thing that I find interesting </v>

299
00:17:56.731 --> 00:17:59.130
<v Speaker 1>about that is that presuppositions are </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary.</v>

300
00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:03.330
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have,</v>

301
00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:04.943
<v Speaker 1>you're a finite cognitive agent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have extraordinarily limited </v>

302
00:18:08.641 --> 00:18:12.120
<v Speaker 1>understanding in order to deal with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world at all,</v>

303
00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:17.390
<v Speaker 1>you have to act as if certain parts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it are both understood and stable,</v>

304
00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:19.013
<v Speaker 1>like unchanging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those elements that you treat as </v>

305
00:18:23.551 --> 00:18:26.940
<v Speaker 1>stable and unchanging are at the deepest</v>
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>

306
00:18:26.941 --> 00:18:27.774
<v Speaker 1>Are you religious presuppositions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you think of them as religious </v>

307
00:18:30.631 --> 00:18:31.464
<v Speaker 1>or not is irrelevant if you don't think </v>
<v Speaker 1>of them as religious or nor that their </v>

308
00:18:36.151 --> 00:18:36.630
<v Speaker 1>religious.</v>

309
00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:37.463
<v Speaker 1>All that means is that you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything about your presuppositions and </v>

310
00:18:39.691 --> 00:18:41.280
<v Speaker 1>that you don't know anything about </v>
<v Speaker 1>religion.</v>

311
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.080
<v Speaker 1>And I learned that partly from reading </v>
<v Speaker 1>Carl Young because one of the things you</v>

312
00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:51.230
<v Speaker 1>posited was that the highest value that </v>
<v Speaker 1>exists in a person's hierarchy of values</v>

313
00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:58.410
<v Speaker 1>is de facto equivalent to their god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

314
00:18:58.411 --> 00:18:59.244
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that isn't often how people </v>

315
00:18:59.971 --> 00:19:02.940
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize the idea of God or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of value,</v>

316
00:19:02.941 --> 00:19:03.774
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't really matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His point was that psychologically a </v>

317
00:19:06.001 --> 00:19:06.834
<v Speaker 1>person's higher highest value serve </v>
<v Speaker 1>precisely the same function that a day </v>

318
00:19:11.521 --> 00:19:16.470
<v Speaker 1>at east serves in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a more explicitly religious society.</v>

319
00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:17.963
<v Speaker 1>So in my experience too is being that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you're ever having a </v>

320
00:19:22.801 --> 00:19:27.801
<v Speaker 1>conversation with someone that is really</v>
<v Speaker 1>digging towards the bottom of things,</v>

321
00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:29.843
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the language that has to be used as </v>

322
00:19:31.141 --> 00:19:31.974
<v Speaker 1>immediately religious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because religious language is the only </v>

323
00:19:33.931 --> 00:19:34.764
<v Speaker 1>language that's kate capable of </v>
<v Speaker 1>encapsulating the phenomena that exists </v>

324
00:19:38.341 --> 00:19:42.630
<v Speaker 1>at the deepest levels of analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if that language has never become</v>

325
00:19:42.631 --> 00:19:45.360
<v Speaker 1>necessary for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that means is that you've never been</v>

326
00:19:45.361 --> 00:19:46.194
<v Speaker 1>into sort of crisis that would </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessitate it to you or that you don't </v>

327
00:19:48.961 --> 00:19:51.030
<v Speaker 1>have the language at hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not good.</v>

328
00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:59.340
<v Speaker 1>Ioannis says some researchers see shame </v>
<v Speaker 1>as something that is very destructive.</v>

329
00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:03.660
<v Speaker 1>The consensus seems to be that it is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion that is always destructive.</v>

330
00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:05.100
<v Speaker 1>Do you agree with this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

331
00:20:05.101 --> 00:20:05.934
<v Speaker 1>that's absolutely ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And only modern psychologists and </v>

332
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:09.833
<v Speaker 1>probably social psychologists would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>foolish enough to even dare deposits </v>

333
00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:14.243
<v Speaker 1>said something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So absolutely observed psychopathy and </v>

334
00:20:17.581 --> 00:20:22.581
<v Speaker 1>shamelessness are the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So shame is shame.</v>

335
00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:23.813
<v Speaker 1>No emotion is always destructive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any emotion taken to an extreme can be </v>

336
00:20:29.551 --> 00:20:32.340
<v Speaker 1>disruptive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like any value taken to an extreme,</v>

337
00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:34.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>made into one thing can be destructive.</v>

338
00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:36.680
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

339
00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:39.270
<v Speaker 1>joy can be destructive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

340
00:20:39.271 --> 00:20:40.104
<v Speaker 1>people who are manic are in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>possessed by a radical excess of </v>

341
00:20:43.501 --> 00:20:47.310
<v Speaker 1>positive emotion and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get incredibly impulsive.</v>

342
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:49.840
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's terribly destructive.</v>

343
00:20:49.841 --> 00:20:50.674
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's almost no form of insanity </v>

344
00:20:52.121 --> 00:20:52.954
<v Speaker 1>that's more destructive than mania.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People will go out and spend all their </v>

345
00:20:55.721 --> 00:20:59.440
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all their family's money and well,</v>

346
00:20:59.441 --> 00:21:04.441
<v Speaker 1>it engage in all sorts of hyper </v>
<v Speaker 1>optimistic interactions with the world.</v>

347
00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:07.810
<v Speaker 1>It would result in their complete rude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

348
00:21:07.811 --> 00:21:10.540
<v Speaker 1>people think of happiness as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>untrammeled positive.</v>

349
00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:11.643
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you think of happiness as positive </v>

350
00:21:12.641 --> 00:21:13.474
<v Speaker 1>emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is partly true because it's also </v>

351
00:21:17.381 --> 00:21:18.214
<v Speaker 1>the absence of negative emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you think of happiness is only a </v>

352
00:21:21.071 --> 00:21:21.904
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you'll have no idea about the </v>

353
00:21:22.721 --> 00:21:26.530
<v Speaker 1>pathologies of positive emotion and </v>
<v Speaker 1>their manifold and shame.</v>

354
00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:27.393
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you do something stupid and</v>
<v Speaker 1>destructive to yourself or to yourself </v>

355
00:21:32.351 --> 00:21:36.100
<v Speaker 1>and the broader social community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should feel shame and you should pay</v>

356
00:21:36.101 --> 00:21:37.840
<v Speaker 1>attention to it and you should learn </v>
<v Speaker 1>from it.</v>

357
00:21:37.841 --> 00:21:38.674
<v Speaker 1>And if you're not capable of doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that then people should stay the hell </v>

358
00:21:42.191 --> 00:21:43.024
<v Speaker 1>away from you because you're shameless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course for most of western </v>

359
00:21:47.561 --> 00:21:48.394
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know enough about other </v>

360
00:21:49.361 --> 00:21:52.490
<v Speaker 1>forms of history to also make the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>comment to call someone.</v>

361
00:21:52.491 --> 00:21:53.820
<v Speaker 1>Shameless was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

362
00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:54.663
<v Speaker 1>it was a tremendous insult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It meant that they didn't have enough </v>

363
00:21:57.431 --> 00:22:00.070
<v Speaker 1>sense to be appalled by the room </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathology.</v>

364
00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:02.530
<v Speaker 1>And there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

365
00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:07.890
<v Speaker 1>that's just not a good thing at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What makes a successful researcher?</v>

366
00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:13.340
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>curiosity,</v>

367
00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.440
<v Speaker 1>curiosity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence,</v>

368
00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:17.520
<v Speaker 1>diligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

369
00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:20.300
<v Speaker 1>those might be the personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>attributes.</v>

370
00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:22.130
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

371
00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:23.420
<v Speaker 1>being embedded in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

372
00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:25.063
<v Speaker 1>in the kind of social network that </v>
<v Speaker 1>supports research endeavors is also </v>

373
00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:31.633
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I guess you would add to that the </v>

374
00:22:34.311 --> 00:22:36.740
<v Speaker 1>capability for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

375
00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:39.860
<v Speaker 1>extended collaborations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

376
00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:44.300
<v Speaker 1>the ability to write is also </v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendously important.</v>

377
00:22:44.301 --> 00:22:45.134
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the place that I see most graduate </v>

378
00:22:46.971 --> 00:22:49.540
<v Speaker 1>students fail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

379
00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:50.403
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very rare that a graduate student </v>

380
00:22:52.611 --> 00:22:53.444
<v Speaker 1>is incapable of formulating a research </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis and they can always discuss </v>

381
00:22:56.361 --> 00:22:57.194
<v Speaker 1>with other people what those hypotheses </v>
<v Speaker 1>might be and also infer that next </v>

382
00:23:00.861 --> 00:23:05.780
<v Speaker 1>logical step merely by being conversant </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the relevant literature.</v>

383
00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:10.070
<v Speaker 1>They can also run experiments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can generally also analyze them,</v>

384
00:23:10.071 --> 00:23:12.380
<v Speaker 1>although that starts to become a </v>
<v Speaker 1>differentiator.</v>

385
00:23:12.381 --> 00:23:14.720
<v Speaker 1>But what kills graduate students is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

386
00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:17.630
<v Speaker 1>they can't write.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And writing is really difficult.</v>

387
00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:23.080
<v Speaker 1>So you have to be able to write and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to either enjoy it,</v>

388
00:23:23.181 --> 00:23:24.014
<v Speaker 1>which means there's something wrong with</v>
<v Speaker 1>you or you have to be compelled to do </v>

389
00:23:26.301 --> 00:23:27.820
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if,</v>

390
00:23:27.850 --> 00:23:29.030
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can't,</v>

391
00:23:29.031 --> 00:23:33.230
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to run into trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

392
00:23:33.231 --> 00:23:35.810
<v Speaker 1>let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christopher,</v>

393
00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:37.063
<v Speaker 1>how do you feel psychotherapy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychiatry should work together and </v>

394
00:23:39.371 --> 00:23:42.170
<v Speaker 1>curing psychological disorders?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

395
00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:45.200
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I presume that by psychiatry,</v>

396
00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:46.483
<v Speaker 1>what you're zeroing in on there probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the use of psychiatric drugs because </v>

397
00:23:51.831 --> 00:23:55.700
<v Speaker 1>otherwise there's not much distinction </v>
<v Speaker 1>between psychiatry and psychotherapy.</v>

398
00:23:56.190 --> 00:23:57.950
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

399
00:23:57.951 --> 00:23:58.784
<v Speaker 1>if you have a serious problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should be very wary of letting your </v>

400
00:24:05.121 --> 00:24:09.770
<v Speaker 1>a priority convictions interfere with </v>
<v Speaker 1>your health.</v>

401
00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:11.090
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

402
00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:15.470
<v Speaker 1>you hear very frequently that people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>all too easily</v>

403
00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:23.330
<v Speaker 1>made all too easily seek help in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>form of pills.</v>

404
00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:24.863
<v Speaker 1>And I just think that's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't see any evidence for that at </v>

405
00:24:29.521 --> 00:24:31.530
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In my experience,</v>

406
00:24:31.531 --> 00:24:36.531
<v Speaker 1>no one comes to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a clinician saying,</v>

407
00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:41.700
<v Speaker 1>please give me a pill for my mental </v>
<v Speaker 1>illness.</v>

408
00:24:41.701 --> 00:24:43.170
<v Speaker 1>So it will go away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

409
00:24:43.171 --> 00:24:44.004
<v Speaker 1>people don't want to think even for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment that they actually have a mental </v>

410
00:24:46.411 --> 00:24:47.670
<v Speaker 1>illness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Second,</v>

411
00:24:47.671 --> 00:24:50.250
<v Speaker 1>they certainly don't want to be modified</v>
<v Speaker 1>by a pill.</v>

412
00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:51.653
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they generally feel that that's an </v>

413
00:24:53.071 --> 00:24:56.640
<v Speaker 1>abdication of responsibility and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're terrified of the side effects.</v>

414
00:24:56.641 --> 00:24:57.474
<v Speaker 1>And that even if they do try it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to get off it as fast as </v>

415
00:25:00.151 --> 00:25:01.800
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that it's a,</v>

416
00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:03.173
<v Speaker 1>it's shameful that they have to be rely </v>
<v Speaker 1>on some sort of medication to begin </v>

417
00:25:08.011 --> 00:25:09.930
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so like a lot of what you're doing,</v>

418
00:25:09.931 --> 00:25:10.764
<v Speaker 1>if you're dealing with someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>truly depressed is helping them come to </v>

419
00:25:14.281 --> 00:25:15.114
<v Speaker 1>terms with the fact that a trial of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>antidepressant might be a useful thing </v>

420
00:25:19.261 --> 00:25:21.390
<v Speaker 1>for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that can take months,</v>

421
00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:22.253
<v Speaker 1>that can take years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So mean you don't want to leave any </v>

422
00:25:27.661 --> 00:25:32.661
<v Speaker 1>stone unturned in your search for health</v>
<v Speaker 1>and psych,</v>

423
00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:35.730
<v Speaker 1>psych,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Psych,</v>

424
00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:36.713
<v Speaker 1>psychiatric medications can be very </v>
<v Speaker 1>useful and sometimes they're absolutely </v>

425
00:25:41.101 --> 00:25:41.970
<v Speaker 1>necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

426
00:25:41.971 --> 00:25:45.230
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

427
00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:47.033
<v Speaker 1>if you have someone who is flirting with</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychosis or who is already entered a </v>

428
00:25:50.131 --> 00:25:51.150
<v Speaker 1>psychotic state.</v>

429
00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:56.100
<v Speaker 1>I think the general consensus in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>literature,</v>

430
00:25:56.101 --> 00:25:56.934
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's appropriate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that if you don't facilitate their </v>

431
00:26:00.451 --> 00:26:01.284
<v Speaker 1>use of anti psychotic medication,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing borders on </v>

432
00:26:04.201 --> 00:26:07.410
<v Speaker 1>malpractice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now cake.</v>

433
00:26:07.411 --> 00:26:08.244
<v Speaker 1>So having said all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability that a medication alone </v>

434
00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:16.500
<v Speaker 1>will be sufficient to address the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem is low,</v>

435
00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:17.423
<v Speaker 1>partly because medications for </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychiatric disorders are much better </v>

436
00:26:22.951 --> 00:26:27.951
<v Speaker 1>conceptualized as complex tools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then as curator of agents,</v>

437
00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:30.830
<v Speaker 1>you have to learn to use them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll have to learn what did,</v>

438
00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:33.090
<v Speaker 1>you have to figure out what the drug </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be.</v>

439
00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:35.850
<v Speaker 1>You have to figure out what the dose </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be.</v>

440
00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:39.390
<v Speaker 1>You have to figure out what time of day </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to take it.</v>

441
00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:40.733
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of those are very complicated </v>

442
00:26:42.211 --> 00:26:45.990
<v Speaker 1>decisions and a fair bit of experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>to optimize.</v>

443
00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:48.683
<v Speaker 1>And then you also have to learn how you </v>
<v Speaker 1>use those medications while you're </v>

444
00:26:52.981 --> 00:26:53.814
<v Speaker 1>simile tineas Lee modifying whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>needs to be modified in your attitudes </v>

445
00:26:56.641 --> 00:26:59.130
<v Speaker 1>or your life in order to progress </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward property.</v>

446
00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:04.130
<v Speaker 1>So the optimal balance between the two </v>
<v Speaker 1>is don't say no to drugs to,</v>

447
00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:09.683
<v Speaker 1>to rapidly because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just might have the sort of problem </v>

448
00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:14.183
<v Speaker 1>that's best addressed with a psychiatric</v>
<v Speaker 1>medication and that could save you and </v>

449
00:27:18.061 --> 00:27:23.061
<v Speaker 1>your family not only suffering but even </v>
<v Speaker 1>death because you know,</v>

450
00:27:24.421 --> 00:27:29.421
<v Speaker 1>the probability of suicide was serious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Depression is quite high and you know,</v>

451
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:30.833
<v Speaker 1>trying to help someone who's committed </v>
<v Speaker 1>suicide because they're depressed is </v>

452
00:27:34.051 --> 00:27:34.884
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things you really want to </v>

453
00:27:36.661 --> 00:27:40.950
<v Speaker 1>do is stave that off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the drugs,</v>

454
00:27:40.951 --> 00:27:41.784
<v Speaker 1>the medications have to be used as tools</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a sophisticated way within a </v>

455
00:27:46.561 --> 00:27:47.394
<v Speaker 1>therapeutic alliance because otherwise </v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability that their work is just </v>

456
00:27:49.771 --> 00:27:50.604
<v Speaker 1>extremely low,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just too complicated and they </v>

457
00:27:51.871 --> 00:27:54.900
<v Speaker 1>have too many negative side effects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like even with antidepressants,</v>

458
00:27:54.901 --> 00:27:55.734
<v Speaker 1>even when they work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they generally interfere with people's </v>

459
00:27:57.871 --> 00:27:59.910
<v Speaker 1>sexual function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

460
00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:01.103
<v Speaker 1>and that can be good if the person who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>depressed is also suffering from </v>

461
00:28:03.991 --> 00:28:04.824
<v Speaker 1>something like premature ejaculation </v>
<v Speaker 1>because antidepressants are good for </v>

462
00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:11.710
<v Speaker 1>fixing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they produce an orgasmic out,</v>

463
00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:12.593
<v Speaker 1>which can be a real catastrophe that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's more likely with women and slow </v>

464
00:28:16.681 --> 00:28:20.670
<v Speaker 1>sexual response and in end inhibited </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual desire.</v>

465
00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:21.503
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that can be extraordinarily </v>

466
00:28:23.221 --> 00:28:24.054
<v Speaker 1>problematic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's just one of a host of side </v>

467
00:28:25.501 --> 00:28:26.334
<v Speaker 1>effects that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that psychiatric medications are likely </v>

468
00:28:28.681 --> 00:28:30.810
<v Speaker 1>to generate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there,</v>

469
00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:32.430
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

470
00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:34.120
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like chainsaws,</v>

471
00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:34.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

472
00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:38.300
<v Speaker 1>there are tools and they're useful but </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're kind of rough and you know,</v>

473
00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:41.240
<v Speaker 1>if you use them in property they can do </v>
<v Speaker 1>more damage than good.</v>

474
00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:49.840
<v Speaker 1>How do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how should you decide between being hard</v>

475
00:28:49.841 --> 00:28:53.860
<v Speaker 1>on yourself and giving yourself a break?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good,</v>

476
00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:57.310
<v Speaker 1>that's a very good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

477
00:28:59.060 --> 00:28:59.893
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the populations that I've had </v>

478
00:29:01.931 --> 00:29:02.764
<v Speaker 1>some experience with as being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've worked with a lot of lawyers and </v>

479
00:29:05.831 --> 00:29:10.270
<v Speaker 1>these are usually very successful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard driving,</v>

480
00:29:10.330 --> 00:29:15.330
<v Speaker 1>ambitious people who are that way for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>variety of reasons often because they're</v>

481
00:29:15.551 --> 00:29:17.890
<v Speaker 1>hyper conscientious as well as being </v>
<v Speaker 1>competitive.</v>

482
00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:19.023
<v Speaker 1>But they're almost always at least hyper</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientious and they have other </v>

483
00:29:21.581 --> 00:29:24.520
<v Speaker 1>personality attributes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

484
00:29:24.521 --> 00:29:27.760
<v Speaker 1>one question that a person like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>addresses is,</v>

485
00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:29.193
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how hard should I work and what am I </v>

486
00:29:30.671 --> 00:29:35.260
<v Speaker 1>just being useless?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the general answer to that isn't,</v>

487
00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:36.153
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should seek some appropriate work </v>

488
00:29:37.831 --> 00:29:40.330
<v Speaker 1>life balance because that's just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bloody cliche.</v>

489
00:29:40.331 --> 00:29:45.220
<v Speaker 1>If you're in high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>highly competitive job,</v>

490
00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:53.100
<v Speaker 1>you're being chased by your peers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your clients and the marketplace to work</v>

491
00:29:54.731 --> 00:29:57.370
<v Speaker 1>flat out as fast as you can all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

492
00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:00.800
<v Speaker 1>And so then the question that you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to face as well,</v>

493
00:30:00.801 --> 00:30:01.634
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Under what conditions should you not do </v>

494
00:30:03.221 --> 00:30:04.054
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've found Piaget's thinking very </v>

495
00:30:06.251 --> 00:30:07.084
<v Speaker 1>useful in formulating an answer to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the fundamental answer is you </v>

496
00:30:12.641 --> 00:30:13.474
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't work so hard that you failed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't work so hard that you </v>

497
00:30:18.071 --> 00:30:23.071
<v Speaker 1>can't continue to work that hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're working 80 hours a week and</v>

498
00:30:25.751 --> 00:30:26.584
<v Speaker 1>say you don't take a day off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will eventually hurt yourself in a </v>

499
00:30:31.721 --> 00:30:35.320
<v Speaker 1>manner that will make it impossible for </v>
<v Speaker 1>you to continue working 80 hours a week.</v>

500
00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:36.393
<v Speaker 1>So that's obviously counterproductive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's assume that your goal is in </v>

501
00:30:39.671 --> 00:30:44.671
<v Speaker 1>spit is to maximize your productivity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you might say,</v>

502
00:30:44.741 --> 00:30:45.574
<v Speaker 1>well that means that you have to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>care of yourself because otherwise </v>

503
00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:49.750
<v Speaker 1>you're going to burn out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get depressed,</v>

504
00:30:49.751 --> 00:30:52.090
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get anxious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get exhausted,</v>

505
00:30:52.570 --> 00:30:53.403
<v Speaker 1>which for which there is no diagnostic </v>
<v Speaker 1>category and that's going to interfere </v>

506
00:30:55.841 --> 00:30:56.674
<v Speaker 1>with your career.</v>

507
00:30:57.220 --> 00:31:01.570
<v Speaker 1>So what you have to learn is how can you</v>
<v Speaker 1>maximize your productivity?</v>

508
00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:03.153
<v Speaker 1>And often that means learning actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>how much work you can do and how much </v>

509
00:31:07.901 --> 00:31:08.734
<v Speaker 1>leisure you need and how much you need </v>
<v Speaker 1>to involve yourself in activities that </v>

510
00:31:12.281 --> 00:31:13.114
<v Speaker 1>are outside of work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that happens to </v>

511
00:31:16.121 --> 00:31:16.954
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly when they hit their </v>

512
00:31:19.391 --> 00:31:20.224
<v Speaker 1>thirties and I'll speak primarily about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the lawyers that I've worked with </v>

513
00:31:23.121 --> 00:31:26.230
<v Speaker 1>because I've looked worked with lots of </v>
<v Speaker 1>female lawyers who will be made partners</v>

514
00:31:26.231 --> 00:31:28.240
<v Speaker 1>in large firms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they've been very successful,</v>

515
00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:29.583
<v Speaker 1>is that they hit 30 or so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're through their apprentice ship </v>

516
00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:39.420
<v Speaker 1>and they start to get very disillusioned</v>
<v Speaker 1>with their job.</v>

517
00:31:40.421 --> 00:31:41.254
<v Speaker 1>And part of the reason for that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that they make partner and then they </v>

518
00:31:43.091 --> 00:31:43.924
<v Speaker 1>find out that the partners that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with have all the foibles </v>

519
00:31:46.481 --> 00:31:48.310
<v Speaker 1>that are associated with normal people.</v>

520
00:31:48.490 --> 00:31:51.400
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a bit of a decline in </v>
<v Speaker 1>idealism,</v>

521
00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:52.593
<v Speaker 1>but they also find out that there </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually is a lot more to life than </v>

522
00:31:56.231 --> 00:31:59.110
<v Speaker 1>working like a mad dog for 80 hours a </v>
<v Speaker 1>week,</v>

523
00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:02.680
<v Speaker 1>purely on legal issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which might not even be that interesting</v>

524
00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:07.570
<v Speaker 1>in and of themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then they have to figure out,</v>

525
00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:12.760
<v Speaker 1>well how much time should be taken off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And most of the lawyers that I've worked</v>

526
00:32:12.761 --> 00:32:13.594
<v Speaker 1>with have ended up working,</v>
<v Speaker 1>working fewer hours but billing more </v>

527
00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:19.263
<v Speaker 1>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in fact they got to have their cake </v>

528
00:32:19.991 --> 00:32:20.824
<v Speaker 1>and eat it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They take a day off a week or two days </v>

529
00:32:22.901 --> 00:32:23.734
<v Speaker 1>off a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They generally can't work shorter hours </v>

530
00:32:26.321 --> 00:32:28.540
<v Speaker 1>cause that isn't how a profession like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that works.</v>

531
00:32:28.570 --> 00:32:32.770
<v Speaker 1>But they can plan to take time off in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the future and do that quite regularly.</v>

532
00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:37.480
<v Speaker 1>So maybe it's a two week vacation every </v>
<v Speaker 1>three months or every four months,</v>

533
00:32:37.481 --> 00:32:38.710
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or a week,</v>

534
00:32:38.711 --> 00:32:39.544
<v Speaker 1>every four months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what they almost inevitably find is </v>

535
00:32:42.351 --> 00:32:44.990
<v Speaker 1>that the boost they get from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>vacation</v>

536
00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:47.663
<v Speaker 1>increases their ability to concentrate </v>
<v Speaker 1>at work and makes them more valuable as </v>

537
00:32:51.121 --> 00:32:51.954
<v Speaker 1>a practicing partner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you can think about it as the </v>

538
00:32:54.361 --> 00:32:58.950
<v Speaker 1>attempt to reach an equilibrium state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question,</v>

539
00:32:58.951 --> 00:33:02.700
<v Speaker 1>how much should you work is really the </v>
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>

540
00:33:03.930 --> 00:33:04.763
<v Speaker 1>how much can you work productively so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can have the longest possible </v>

541
00:33:08.431 --> 00:33:09.264
<v Speaker 1>productive</v>

542
00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:11.943
<v Speaker 1>and sustainable career?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that means that you have to set up </v>

543
00:33:14.501 --> 00:33:15.334
<v Speaker 1>your career in such a way that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't eat so much of your life that </v>

544
00:33:18.101 --> 00:33:18.934
<v Speaker 1>you come to resent and hate it because </v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise you'll bail out or you'll act </v>

545
00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:25.120
<v Speaker 1>in a counterproductive matter all you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>hurting yourself or so forth.</v>

546
00:33:25.510 --> 00:33:26.343
<v Speaker 1>So I would say for young people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way that you figured that out is </v>

547
00:33:30.221 --> 00:33:31.054
<v Speaker 1>that you pick something difficult to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you work yourself half to death </v>

548
00:33:33.911 --> 00:33:38.440
<v Speaker 1>doing it so that you can figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>where your actual limits are,</v>

549
00:33:38.530 --> 00:33:42.010
<v Speaker 1>like your limits of psychological and </v>
<v Speaker 1>physiological endurance.</v>

550
00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:43.053
<v Speaker 1>And once you've exceeded your limits to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pull back to the point where that </v>

551
00:33:46.631 --> 00:33:47.464
<v Speaker 1>becomes sustainable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that way you're being hard on </v>

552
00:33:50.381 --> 00:33:51.214
<v Speaker 1>yourself to test yourself out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're also allowing yourself the </v>

553
00:33:55.450 --> 00:33:56.283
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to pursue what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>pursuing in the best of possible health </v>

554
00:34:00.581 --> 00:34:04.540
<v Speaker 1>and with the highest probability of </v>
<v Speaker 1>continuing in a high quality manner into</v>

555
00:34:04.541 --> 00:34:07.840
<v Speaker 1>the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

556
00:34:07.841 --> 00:34:09.490
<v Speaker 1>what are my views on euthanasia?</v>

557
00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:12.413
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

558
00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:13.373
<v Speaker 1>Is the fact that so many are against it </v>
<v Speaker 1>a symptom of individuals and societal </v>

559
00:34:16.201 --> 00:34:17.034
<v Speaker 1>aversion to death?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or is it of the more practical issues </v>

560
00:34:19.801 --> 00:34:20.850
<v Speaker 1>like consent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>morality?</v>

561
00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:22.410
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I mean euthanasia.</v>

562
00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:24.240
<v Speaker 1>So complete nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

563
00:34:24.870 --> 00:34:25.703
<v Speaker 1>you know the slippery slope from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's okay if someone who's terminally </v>

564
00:34:29.281 --> 00:34:32.970
<v Speaker 1>ill wants to die too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's empty out the hospitals of all the</v>

565
00:34:32.971 --> 00:34:37.070
<v Speaker 1>people in it who are no longer being </v>
<v Speaker 1>socially productive is like that's a,</v>

566
00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:43.700
<v Speaker 1>that's a road that society's traveled </v>
<v Speaker 1>down one tiny little step at a time.</v>

567
00:34:44.430 --> 00:34:48.840
<v Speaker 1>And so when you open up the specter of </v>
<v Speaker 1>euthanasia,</v>

568
00:34:49.650 --> 00:34:53.430
<v Speaker 1>you're also opening up endless cans of </v>
<v Speaker 1>snakes,</v>

569
00:34:53.790 --> 00:34:58.790
<v Speaker 1>the existence of which many of which you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have no idea even exist.</v>

570
00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:01.293
<v Speaker 3>Now</v>

571
00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:06.970
<v Speaker 1>I kind of think of euthanasia like </v>
<v Speaker 1>torture.</v>

572
00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:11.810
<v Speaker 1>So you can imagine this situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine the following situation.</v>

573
00:35:11.811 --> 00:35:16.310
<v Speaker 1>And it's unrealistic because no real </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation is this clearly bounded,</v>

574
00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:17.840
<v Speaker 1>but we'll use it for the sake of </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument.</v>

575
00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:19.063
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that you know for certain that </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone in your custody as planted an </v>

576
00:35:25.611 --> 00:35:26.444
<v Speaker 1>extremely high and explosive device and </v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely high capacity in a football </v>

577
00:35:30.381 --> 00:35:33.950
<v Speaker 1>stadium and they are going to detonate </v>
<v Speaker 1>it unless you find out where it is.</v>

578
00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:36.291
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>

579
00:35:36.291 --> 00:35:37.124
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what interrogation techniques might be </v>

580
00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:47.420
<v Speaker 1>ethically available to you in order to </v>
<v Speaker 1>conduct that investigation?</v>

581
00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:52.210
<v Speaker 1>And I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know this is</v>

582
00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:57.590
<v Speaker 1>a flawed philosophical argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just using it as,</v>

583
00:35:57.591 --> 00:35:59.550
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a as an example,</v>

584
00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:06.600
<v Speaker 1>high levels of threat isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>interrogation technique.</v>

585
00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:11.130
<v Speaker 1>You should be willing to undergo </v>
<v Speaker 1>prosecution for your actions.</v>

586
00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:14.130
<v Speaker 1>You can't expect to get a free ride even</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

587
00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:15.383
<v Speaker 1>because the use of torture say in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation like that is so absurdly </v>

588
00:36:18.391 --> 00:36:19.224
<v Speaker 1>socially dangerous that even if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could make a case that it was ethically </v>

589
00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:25.470
<v Speaker 1>justifiable in that particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstance,</v>

590
00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:26.843
<v Speaker 1>you should pretty much be willing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>give up the rest of your life as a </v>

591
00:36:28.891 --> 00:36:30.780
<v Speaker 1>consequence of having participated in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

592
00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:33.960
<v Speaker 1>And I kind of think the same thing about</v>
<v Speaker 1>euthanasia.</v>

593
00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:34.853
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

594
00:36:37.070 --> 00:36:37.903
<v Speaker 1>you know what it needs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you said once the nobody who's truly </v>

595
00:36:40.461 --> 00:36:44.210
<v Speaker 1>lived hasn't experienced the necessity </v>
<v Speaker 1>of killing,</v>

596
00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:48.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to put this in simple terms,</v>

597
00:36:49.010 --> 00:36:49.843
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have my dog put down in February </v>

598
00:36:51.591 --> 00:36:56.591
<v Speaker 1>because he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was done and allowing him to expire.</v>

599
00:36:57.271 --> 00:37:02.271
<v Speaker 1>It naturally seem to</v>
<v Speaker 1>involve nothing but a lot of unnecessary</v>

600
00:37:03.111 --> 00:37:08.080
<v Speaker 1>suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can certainly imagine a situation</v>

601
00:37:08.081 --> 00:37:13.081
<v Speaker 1>where euthanasia seems like an</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ethical option,</v>

602
00:37:14.701 --> 00:37:15.534
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean that it shouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>be absolutely surrounded by high </v>

603
00:37:18.691 --> 00:37:20.010
<v Speaker 1>thickets of illegality.</v>

604
00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:22.320
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

605
00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:24.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I think to do the right thing,</v>

606
00:37:24.841 --> 00:37:27.270
<v Speaker 1>you're required to break the law and be </v>
<v Speaker 1>punished for it.</v>

607
00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:33.860
<v Speaker 1>Now</v>
<v Speaker 1>part from that,</v>

608
00:37:34.611 --> 00:37:37.790
<v Speaker 1>I've also learned that commenting </v>
<v Speaker 1>generally on questions like that is,</v>

609
00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:42.050
<v Speaker 1>this is almost always a mistake because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the devil's always in the details.</v>

610
00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:45.800
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

611
00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:48.373
<v Speaker 1>Is there a way to find your true passion</v>
<v Speaker 1>or is that just a cliche was definitely </v>

612
00:37:51.921 --> 00:37:53.880
<v Speaker 1>a cliche and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>

613
00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:54.913
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the sort of thing that actually </v>

614
00:37:56.751 --> 00:38:01.010
<v Speaker 1>annoys me quite a lot about new age </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinkers.</v>

615
00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:03.890
<v Speaker 1>I would more or less put Joseph Campbell</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that category.</v>

616
00:38:04.530 --> 00:38:05.363
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you can find what compels you </v>

617
00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:12.623
<v Speaker 1>and what might enable you to live in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>high quality manner despite the </v>

618
00:38:17.161 --> 00:38:20.280
<v Speaker 1>suffering that's associated with life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you can discover that.</v>

619
00:38:20.281 --> 00:38:21.114
<v Speaker 1>And I think part of the way you discover</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is by watching yourself and </v>

620
00:38:25.381 --> 00:38:28.200
<v Speaker 1>learning when it is that you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningfully engaged.</v>

621
00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:31.503
<v Speaker 1>You have to notice that it's something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that happens to you in some rather than </v>

622
00:38:35.741 --> 00:38:36.574
<v Speaker 1>something that you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to notice when you're </v>

623
00:38:39.101 --> 00:38:39.934
<v Speaker 1>meaningfully engaged and then you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to work to expand the amount of time </v>

624
00:38:44.471 --> 00:38:45.304
<v Speaker 1>that you spend in that state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I would also say that there are </v>

625
00:38:48.791 --> 00:38:51.730
<v Speaker 1>moral requirements that go along with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that too because you might say,</v>

626
00:38:51.731 --> 00:38:54.070
<v Speaker 1>well what if you happen to be the sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of person,</v>

627
00:38:54.071 --> 00:38:58.660
<v Speaker 1>for example who finds torturing small </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals meaningfully engaging?</v>

628
00:38:59.610 --> 00:39:02.260
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like that's a,</v>

629
00:39:02.650 --> 00:39:06.760
<v Speaker 1>that's the sort of meaningful engagement</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you probably don't want to expand.</v>

630
00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:07.983
<v Speaker 1>So I would say that if you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>set up your life so that you maximize </v>

631
00:39:10.961 --> 00:39:12.760
<v Speaker 1>your meaningful engagement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to,</v>

632
00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:15.100
<v Speaker 1>there's a number of other things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to do.</v>

633
00:39:15.101 --> 00:39:18.250
<v Speaker 1>At the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of those is that you have to get</v>

634
00:39:18.251 --> 00:39:22.300
<v Speaker 1>very clear about</v>
<v Speaker 1>who you are and what you're doing.</v>

635
00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:26.590
<v Speaker 1>And so although this would be grounds </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a much longer discussion,</v>

636
00:39:26.591 --> 00:39:30.970
<v Speaker 1>I think that one of the things that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to do if you're going to attempt to</v>

637
00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:32.013
<v Speaker 1>maximize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make meaningful engagement is that you </v>

638
00:39:33.791 --> 00:39:38.791
<v Speaker 1>also have to do such things as</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

639
00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:40.293
<v Speaker 1>endeavor to stop deceiving yourself and </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people in every way you possibly </v>

640
00:39:44.141 --> 00:39:44.974
<v Speaker 1>can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of the reason for that is that </v>

641
00:39:47.741 --> 00:39:52.741
<v Speaker 1>if you engage in deception of any sort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you pathologize the structure,</v>

642
00:39:56.830 --> 00:39:57.663
<v Speaker 1>the structure of your being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you could say you pathologize the </v>

643
00:40:00.041 --> 00:40:04.360
<v Speaker 1>structure of your nervous system and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can't trust it's reports.</v>

644
00:40:05.050 --> 00:40:05.883
<v Speaker 1>So if you're nervous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to rely on your nervous </v>

645
00:40:07.661 --> 00:40:08.494
<v Speaker 1>system's reports of meaningful </v>
<v Speaker 1>engagement to guide your future </v>

646
00:40:11.051 --> 00:40:13.930
<v Speaker 1>activities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you better do everything you can to make</v>

647
00:40:13.931 --> 00:40:14.764
<v Speaker 1>sure that you're not filling that </v>
<v Speaker 1>nervous system with the kind of garbage </v>

648
00:40:17.381 --> 00:40:19.630
<v Speaker 1>that's going to make it malfunction and </v>
<v Speaker 1>give again,</v>

649
00:40:19.631 --> 00:40:21.010
<v Speaker 1>give you false reports.</v>

650
00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:22.173
<v Speaker 1>So I think that moving towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningful engagement has to be </v>

651
00:40:25.211 --> 00:40:30.070
<v Speaker 1>associated with making truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your highest value because otherwise you</v>

652
00:40:30.071 --> 00:40:33.460
<v Speaker 1>can't trust yourself as your own guide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

653
00:40:33.461 --> 00:40:34.294
<v Speaker 1>the Catholics have struggled with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a long time from a theological </v>

654
00:40:36.551 --> 00:40:38.500
<v Speaker 1>perspective because the Catholic </v>
<v Speaker 1>position,</v>

655
00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:39.633
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that human beings are so steeped in </v>

656
00:40:41.531 --> 00:40:42.364
<v Speaker 1>sin that they can't trust their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>instincts in relationship to good and </v>

657
00:40:45.911 --> 00:40:49.990
<v Speaker 1>evil and have to use the church and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>priesthood as an intermediary.</v>

658
00:40:50.290 --> 00:40:55.120
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can obviously have an argument about</v>

659
00:40:55.121 --> 00:40:55.954
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course Protestants have </v>

660
00:40:56.921 --> 00:40:57.754
<v Speaker 1>historically done that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you've got to give the Catholics </v>

661
00:40:59.321 --> 00:41:02.000
<v Speaker 1>there do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like people aren't pure,</v>

662
00:41:02.001 --> 00:41:05.360
<v Speaker 1>are by nature and and only traveled in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their vision by us.</v>

663
00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:06.223
<v Speaker 1>It'll sociological impediments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are also corrupt beyond belief </v>

664
00:41:08.801 --> 00:41:11.740
<v Speaker 1>individually and half to use society as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a source of value.</v>

665
00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:17.340
<v Speaker 1>So if you're going to personalize your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life in some sense,</v>

666
00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:22.060
<v Speaker 1>you better act in a manner that makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>you a reliable guide.</v>

667
00:41:22.570 --> 00:41:27.570
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>what time is two 30 well,</v>

668
00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:29.703
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe we'll call that a day </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm starting to get tired and </v>

669
00:41:33.010 --> 00:41:37.210
<v Speaker 1>I'll start giving answers that not only </v>
<v Speaker 1>rambled,</v>

670
00:41:37.211 --> 00:41:39.190
<v Speaker 1>but never actually come back to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>

671
00:41:39.191 --> 00:41:41.380
<v Speaker 1>So let's call that a day and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

672
00:41:42.130 --> 00:41:43.540
<v Speaker 1>we'll take a look and see how it worked.</v>
