1
00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:21.190
<v Speaker 1>Three difficult stories tonight and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully my plan is to get through all </v>

2
00:00:22.191 --> 00:00:24.380
<v Speaker 1>three of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we'll see how that goes.</v>

3
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:30.010
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to talk about the story </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Sodom and Gomorrah and then the story</v>

4
00:00:32.871 --> 00:00:35.810
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sacrifice of Isaac,</v>

5
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.420
<v Speaker 1>which an extremely complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated story and so we'll try to </v>

6
00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:46.541
<v Speaker 1>make some headway with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The story of Sodom and Gomorrah is </v>

7
00:00:46.541 --> 00:00:46.541
<v Speaker 1>plenty complicated too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

8
00:00:46.541 --> 00:00:49.970
<v Speaker 1>so what we established last week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in part,</v>

9
00:00:49.971 --> 00:00:54.971
<v Speaker 1>was this idea that the abrahamic </v>
<v Speaker 1>narratives are set up as punctuated </v>

10
00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.790
<v Speaker 1>ipacs I suppose in Abraham's life and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>were hypothesizing that you know,</v>

11
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.580
<v Speaker 1>you set out a goal for yourself and your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

12
00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.080
<v Speaker 1>It's like a stage in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might say that and then when you run</v>

13
00:01:09.081 --> 00:01:12.260
<v Speaker 1>that goal to its end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when that stage comes to an end,</v>

14
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.280
<v Speaker 1>then you have to regroup and Orient </v>
<v Speaker 1>Yourself.</v>

15
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.280
<v Speaker 1>Once again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was making the case that that's a </v>

16
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.391
<v Speaker 1>good time to make necessary sacrifices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

17
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.700
<v Speaker 1>part of that's because as you move </v>
<v Speaker 1>through your life,</v>

18
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.480
<v Speaker 1>you have to shed that which is no longer</v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary and because otherwise it </v>

19
00:01:37.161 --> 00:01:42.161
<v Speaker 1>accretes around you and holds you down </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you perish sooner than you should </v>

20
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.270
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's in large part because</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't dispense with your life as </v>

21
00:01:49.461 --> 00:01:54.461
<v Speaker 1>you move through it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the stress of all that undone </v>

22
00:01:54.461 --> 00:01:58.061
<v Speaker 1>business and all those unmade decisions </v>
<v Speaker 1>turns into a kind of chaos around you </v>

23
00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.220
<v Speaker 1>and that chaos puts you in a state of </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychophysiological emergency </v>

24
00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.601
<v Speaker 1>preparedness chronically and that just </v>
<v Speaker 1>ages you and so it's necessary in some </v>

25
00:02:09.741 --> 00:02:14.741
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to stay light on your feet and also I </v>

26
00:02:14.741 --> 00:02:17.531
<v Speaker 1>think to renew your commitment to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>aim upward.</v>

27
00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.310
<v Speaker 1>And I believe that that's what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrificial routines in the abrahamic </v>

28
00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.730
<v Speaker 1>stories dramatize.</v>

29
00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.730
<v Speaker 1>I said already that these things are </v>
<v Speaker 1>often first portrayed very dramatically </v>

30
00:02:32.871 --> 00:02:37.871
<v Speaker 1>and concretely before they become </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologist and we'll see because one </v>

31
00:02:38.571 --> 00:02:43.571
<v Speaker 1>of the things that happens tonight as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well in these stories is that when God </v>

32
00:02:43.571 --> 00:02:46.160
<v Speaker 1>makes his covenant with Abraham,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the next part of the story.</v>

33
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.700
<v Speaker 1>It's also when the idea of circa </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumcision is introduced into ancient </v>

34
00:02:51.951 --> 00:02:56.951
<v Speaker 1>Hebrew culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there's every bit of evidence that </v>

35
00:02:56.951 --> 00:02:58.820
<v Speaker 1>other cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're utilizing circumcision beforehand,</v>

36
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.300
<v Speaker 1>so it wasn't necessarily a novel </v>
<v Speaker 1>invention of the Abrahamic people,</v>

37
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.420
<v Speaker 1>but I see it's introduction as a step on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the road to this psychologist creation </v>

38
00:03:10.631 --> 00:03:13.660
<v Speaker 1>of the idea of of sacrifice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

39
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.720
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's giving up something concrete and </v>

40
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.001
<v Speaker 1>then second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's signified by the sacrifice of a </v>

41
00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:24.700
<v Speaker 1>part of the body instead of for the sake</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the whole.</v>

42
00:03:24.701 --> 00:03:29.701
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's dramatizing the idea that you have </v>

43
00:03:29.701 --> 00:03:31.030
<v Speaker 1>to give up a part of yourself for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sake of the whole and eventually well by</v>

44
00:03:31.031 --> 00:03:35.170
<v Speaker 1>modern times that becomes virtually </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely psycho psychological and it's</v>

45
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:40.710
<v Speaker 1>in its essence in that we all understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps not as well as we should,</v>

46
00:03:40.931 --> 00:03:45.931
<v Speaker 1>but at least well enough to explain it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's necessary to make sacrifices </v>

47
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:48.250
<v Speaker 1>to move ahead in life.</v>

48
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.220
<v Speaker 1>One of the themes that I'd like to </v>
<v Speaker 1>explore tonight in relationship,</v>

49
00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.860
<v Speaker 1>especially to the sacrifice of Isaac,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>

50
00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once humanity had established the idea </v>

51
00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:03.700
<v Speaker 1>that sacrifice was necessary to move </v>
<v Speaker 1>ahead,</v>

52
00:04:03.701 --> 00:04:07.570
<v Speaker 1>which is really a discovery of </v>
<v Speaker 1>incalculable magnitude,</v>

53
00:04:07.571 --> 00:04:10.150
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that the idea that you can give</v>

54
00:04:10.151 --> 00:04:15.151
<v Speaker 1>up something in the present and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>will in some sense ensure a better </v>

55
00:04:15.151 --> 00:04:19.861
<v Speaker 1>future is an unbelievable achievement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's equivalent to the discovery of the </v>

56
00:04:19.861 --> 00:04:23.911
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's equivalent to the discovery of the </v>

57
00:04:23.911 --> 00:04:26.011
<v Speaker 1>utility of work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's importance cannot be </v>

58
00:04:26.011 --> 00:04:26.011
<v Speaker 1>overstated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

59
00:04:26.011 --> 00:04:27.940
<v Speaker 1>so it took a long time for people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure this out.</v>

60
00:04:27.941 --> 00:04:29.860
<v Speaker 1>Animals haven't figured it out at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

61
00:04:29.861 --> 00:04:34.861
<v Speaker 1>We've figured it out and it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard for people to make sacrifices </v>

62
00:04:34.861 --> 00:04:38.491
<v Speaker 1>because of course the president has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>major grip on you as it should because </v>

63
00:04:38.491 --> 00:04:39.280
<v Speaker 1>in some way you live in the present.</v>

64
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.790
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the twin problem of getting the </v>

65
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.211
<v Speaker 1>whole idea of sacrifice up and running </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then figuring out exactly what it </v>

66
00:04:48.211 --> 00:04:51.391
<v Speaker 1>means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a problem that branches off </v>

67
00:04:51.391 --> 00:04:53.431
<v Speaker 1>that tour a twofold problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the hypothesis is that sacrifice is </v>

68
00:04:53.951 --> 00:04:58.951
<v Speaker 1>necessary to ensure the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the future is safe and secure and </v>

69
00:04:58.951 --> 00:05:00.370
<v Speaker 1>productive and positive and all of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

70
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:05.790
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then the question immediate two </v>

71
00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.790
<v Speaker 1>questions immediately rise from that </v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

72
00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:06.610
<v Speaker 1>One is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

73
00:05:06.611 --> 00:05:11.611
<v Speaker 1>what's the proper sacrifice?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we already talked about that a </v>

74
00:05:11.611 --> 00:05:14.431
<v Speaker 1>little bit with regards to Cain and Abel</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things we saw was that </v>

75
00:05:14.431 --> 00:05:14.920
<v Speaker 1>keynes sacrifice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it was,</v>

76
00:05:14.921 --> 00:05:17.380
<v Speaker 1>was wrong and ables was right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

77
00:05:17.381 --> 00:05:19.840
<v Speaker 1>is seemed to be right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Abraham seems to right.</v>

78
00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.200
<v Speaker 1>There is something about a sacrifice </v>
<v Speaker 1>that can be correct.</v>

79
00:05:23.201 --> 00:05:25.540
<v Speaker 1>There's something about a sacrifice that</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be incorrect.</v>

80
00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.470
<v Speaker 1>The question is what would be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>maximally correct sacrifice?</v>

81
00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:35.010
<v Speaker 1>So because that's an obvious question to</v>
<v Speaker 1>arise from the mere observation that </v>

82
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.290
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice is necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

83
00:05:35.291 --> 00:05:37.300
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to sacrifice and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary,</v>

84
00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:42.250
<v Speaker 1>well how is it that you would behave if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you were going to do it really well?</v>

85
00:05:42.251 --> 00:05:44.380
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to do it perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

86
00:05:44.381 --> 00:05:48.040
<v Speaker 1>So that's question number one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then question number two might be,</v>

87
00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.550
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the future can be better because of a</v>

88
00:05:51.551 --> 00:05:56.551
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice and sacrifice is can vary in </v>
<v Speaker 1>quality than how much better could the </v>

89
00:05:57.321 --> 00:05:58.280
<v Speaker 1>future be?</v>

90
00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.100
<v Speaker 2>If your sacrifice was of the highest </v>
<v Speaker 2>quality,</v>

91
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:06.130
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a limit issue there and the </v>

92
00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:06.130
<v Speaker 2>limit is something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

93
00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:09.161
<v Speaker 2>how good could your life be if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>really got your act together and you </v>

94
00:06:09.161 --> 00:06:11.450
<v Speaker 2>gave up all the things that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>impeding you in your movement forward.</v>

95
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:16.600
<v Speaker 2>If you did that forthrightly and with </v>
<v Speaker 2>integrity and with seriousness with with</v>

96
00:06:17.031 --> 00:06:19.670
<v Speaker 2>dead seriousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you tried to set your life right,</v>

97
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:25.060
<v Speaker 2>what is the upper limit with regards to </v>
<v Speaker 2>how your life might lay itself out?</v>

98
00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:26.420
<v Speaker 2>And I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

99
00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:31.750
<v Speaker 2>we don't know the answer to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that the idea of something </v>

100
00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:36.521
<v Speaker 2>like the city of God or the Kingdom of </v>
<v Speaker 2>God on Earth or the reestablishment of </v>

101
00:06:36.521 --> 00:06:39.080
<v Speaker 2>paradise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that is the answer of the</v>

102
00:06:39.081 --> 00:06:44.081
<v Speaker 2>imagination to the question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how good could the future be if </v>

103
00:06:44.081 --> 00:06:47.240
<v Speaker 2>sacrifice was optimized?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And those are archetypical questions,</v>

104
00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:52.250
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>An architectural question is a question </v>

105
00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:53.720
<v Speaker 2>that everyone asks whether they know it </v>
<v Speaker 2>or not because sometimes you can act out</v>

106
00:06:53.721 --> 00:06:58.721
<v Speaker 2>a question and the question is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>question that everyone asks and an </v>

107
00:06:58.721 --> 00:07:02.351
<v Speaker 2>archetypal answer is the answer that </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't be made any better to that </v>

108
00:07:02.351 --> 00:07:05.090
<v Speaker 2>question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I can give you an example of that.</v>

109
00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:10.090
<v Speaker 2>The reason that Christ's passion is an </v>
<v Speaker 2>archetypal story is because it's a kind </v>

110
00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:10.090
<v Speaker 2>of limit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

111
00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:15.070
<v Speaker 2>It's the worst possible set of things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that can happen to the best possible </v>

112
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:19.121
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's a story that constitutes a </v>

113
00:07:19.121 --> 00:07:22.361
<v Speaker 2>limit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has nothing to do with the factual </v>

114
00:07:22.361 --> 00:07:22.910
<v Speaker 2>reality of the story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a completely independent issue.</v>

115
00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:28.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm speaking about this psychologically </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that certain stories can exhaust </v>

116
00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:30.200
<v Speaker 2>themselves in a perfect form and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be the architectural form.</v>

117
00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:35.980
<v Speaker 2>So that's the territory that we're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to wander around in a little bit today </v>

118
00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:39.851
<v Speaker 2>and we'll use the stories as anchors </v>
<v Speaker 2>been thinking a lot about the Sodom and </v>

119
00:07:39.851 --> 00:07:44.471
<v Speaker 2>Gomorrah story because it has a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's classically associated with a </v>

120
00:07:44.471 --> 00:07:48.641
<v Speaker 2>biblical injunction against </v>
<v Speaker 2>homosexuality and that's often how it's </v>

121
00:07:48.641 --> 00:07:51.911
<v Speaker 2>read.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say in particular by the more </v>

122
00:07:51.911 --> 00:07:51.911
<v Speaker 2>fundamentalist end of the Christian </v>
<v Speaker 2>spectrum,</v>

123
00:07:51.911 --> 00:07:56.501
<v Speaker 2>and I've thought about that a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's pretty damn clear that the </v>

124
00:07:56.501 --> 00:07:57.800
<v Speaker 2>story of Sodom and Gomorrah has </v>
<v Speaker 2>something to do with sexual impropriety,</v>

125
00:07:57.801 --> 00:08:02.801
<v Speaker 2>but I've really come to the conclusion </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's very little to do with </v>

126
00:08:02.801 --> 00:08:05.771
<v Speaker 2>homosexuality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we'll see how that interpretation </v>

127
00:08:05.771 --> 00:08:07.040
<v Speaker 2>prevails as we walked through this </v>
<v Speaker 2>tonight.</v>

128
00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:12.310
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we'll start with a bit of a recap </v>

129
00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:12.310
<v Speaker 2>from last week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Abraham's had his.</v>

130
00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:14.540
<v Speaker 2>He had his last adventure and he's 90 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years old,</v>

131
00:08:14.541 --> 00:08:19.541
<v Speaker 2>99 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Lord appeared to Abraham and said </v>

132
00:08:19.541 --> 00:08:19.640
<v Speaker 2>unto him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am the Almighty God.</v>

133
00:08:19.641 --> 00:08:22.160
<v Speaker 2>Walk before me and be thou perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

134
00:08:22.161 --> 00:08:25.070
<v Speaker 2>that's quite the command.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

135
00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:29.390
<v Speaker 2>Alexander mcclaren,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who we talked about before,</v>

136
00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:34.600
<v Speaker 2>it's a elaborated upon this slightly and</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what he had to say.</v>

137
00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:39.470
<v Speaker 2>This is not precisely walking with God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea of walking before God.</v>

138
00:08:39.471 --> 00:08:44.471
<v Speaker 2>It is rather that have an active life </v>
<v Speaker 2>spent in continual consciousness of </v>

139
00:08:44.471 --> 00:08:48.110
<v Speaker 2>being naked and open before the eyes of </v>
<v Speaker 2>him to whom we have to give an account.</v>

140
00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:49.400
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>

141
00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:54.460
<v Speaker 2>that's an idea that's in keeping with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the notion that what we're seeing in </v>

142
00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:58.451
<v Speaker 2>Abrahamic story is the call to adventure</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>

143
00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:00.930
<v Speaker 2>of man of the typical person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

144
00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:03.450
<v Speaker 2>Because your life in some sense is an </v>
<v Speaker 2>adventure.</v>

145
00:09:03.451 --> 00:09:08.451
<v Speaker 2>And I suppose the reason for that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're confronted by things that </v>

146
00:09:08.451 --> 00:09:09.900
<v Speaker 2>you cannot understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you have not yet mastered.</v>

147
00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:14.880
<v Speaker 2>There's a heavy price to be paid if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>fail to conduct yourself appropriately,</v>

148
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.440
<v Speaker 2>and there's a large reward to be gained </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you conduct yourself properly.</v>

149
00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:23.730
<v Speaker 2>And so that pretty much defines an </v>
<v Speaker 2>adventure story and God calls to Abraham</v>

150
00:09:23.731 --> 00:09:25.200
<v Speaker 2>and tells him to move out into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

151
00:09:25.201 --> 00:09:30.201
<v Speaker 2>to leave what he's familiar with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go into the strange lands of famine </v>

152
00:09:30.201 --> 00:09:34.191
<v Speaker 2>and tyranny and to find his place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that works out quite nicely for </v>

153
00:09:35.371 --> 00:09:40.371
<v Speaker 2>Abraham.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what that also means is that </v>

154
00:09:40.371 --> 00:09:40.860
<v Speaker 2>because Abraham is doing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciously,</v>

155
00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:43.290
<v Speaker 2>at least according to this </v>
<v Speaker 2>interpretation,</v>

156
00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:47.850
<v Speaker 2>that he's not naive in his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in his determination to move forward.</v>

157
00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:48.930
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

158
00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:51.360
<v Speaker 2>I've dealt with lots of people who have </v>
<v Speaker 2>anxiety disorders,</v>

159
00:09:51.361 --> 00:09:56.361
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and one thing about people who have </v>

160
00:09:56.361 --> 00:09:56.361
<v Speaker 2>anxiety disorders is they are not </v>
<v Speaker 2>mysterious to me.</v>

161
00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:00.630
<v Speaker 2>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's no problem for me to understand why</v>

162
00:10:00.631 --> 00:10:05.631
<v Speaker 2>people have anxiety disorders or why </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're depressed or why they have </v>

163
00:10:05.631 --> 00:10:08.070
<v Speaker 2>substance use problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The mystery to me is always white people</v>

164
00:10:08.071 --> 00:10:13.071
<v Speaker 2>don't have all of those things at once </v>
<v Speaker 2>because everybody has a reason to be </v>

165
00:10:13.071 --> 00:10:13.320
<v Speaker 2>anxious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

166
00:10:13.321 --> 00:10:18.321
<v Speaker 2>we have the ultimate reason to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>anxious because we know that we're </v>

167
00:10:18.321 --> 00:10:21.501
<v Speaker 2>vulnerable and we know that we're going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to die and how you can not be anxious </v>

168
00:10:21.501 --> 00:10:22.680
<v Speaker 2>under those circumstances is a great </v>
<v Speaker 2>mystery.</v>

169
00:10:22.681 --> 00:10:27.030
<v Speaker 2>It's a massive mystery and that same </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing applies with regards to depression</v>

170
00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:32.480
<v Speaker 2>and then the same thing applies to some </v>
<v Speaker 2>degree with regards to drug and alcohol </v>

171
00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:32.480
<v Speaker 2>abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As I said last week,</v>

172
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:35.700
<v Speaker 2>there's plenty of reasons to drown your </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness and alcohol.</v>

173
00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:40.730
<v Speaker 2>That's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could refer to the aforementioned </v>

174
00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:43.340
<v Speaker 2>anxiety and depression not least and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the and the sorts of drugs that </v>

175
00:10:43.771 --> 00:10:48.771
<v Speaker 2>people are prone to take our chemicals </v>
<v Speaker 2>that take the effect of edge off the </v>

176
00:10:48.771 --> 00:10:50.400
<v Speaker 2>tragedy of life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

177
00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:56.700
<v Speaker 2>so back to back to the issue of of of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fear.</v>

178
00:10:56.970 --> 00:11:01.410
<v Speaker 2>Being Abraham is self conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what this commentary he says,</v>

179
00:11:01.411 --> 00:11:06.411
<v Speaker 2>but the thing is as he moves forward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>despite that he self conscious and he </v>

180
00:11:06.411 --> 00:11:09.741
<v Speaker 2>knows the danger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he moves forward despite that and </v>

181
00:11:09.741 --> 00:11:12.410
<v Speaker 2>that's actually the appropriate response</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the face of actual non naive </v>

182
00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:17.361
<v Speaker 2>understanding of what constitutes life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're naive and you move </v>

183
00:11:17.361 --> 00:11:17.361
<v Speaker 2>forward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

184
00:11:17.361 --> 00:11:17.361
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the hell do you know?</v>

185
00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:22.490
<v Speaker 2>You know there's no courage and naivety </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you don't know what there is to </v>

186
00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:26.960
<v Speaker 2>stop you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know what dangers you might </v>

187
00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:28.911
<v Speaker 2>apprehend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to be aware of what it is that your </v>

188
00:11:28.911 --> 00:11:30.660
<v Speaker 2>problem is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to be alert existentially,</v>

189
00:11:30.661 --> 00:11:32.700
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or to be fully self conscious means that</v>

190
00:11:32.701 --> 00:11:37.701
<v Speaker 2>you're perfectly aware of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>limitations and how you might be hurt </v>

191
00:11:37.701 --> 00:11:39.870
<v Speaker 2>and then to make the decision to move </v>
<v Speaker 2>forward into the unknown and the land of</v>

192
00:11:39.871 --> 00:11:40.380
<v Speaker 2>the stranger.</v>

193
00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:41.580
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the.</v>

194
00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:46.760
<v Speaker 2>I would say that's one of the secrets to</v>
<v Speaker 2>a good life and I can say that really </v>

195
00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:50.280
<v Speaker 2>without fear of contradiction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would I would say because the clinical</v>

196
00:11:50.281 --> 00:11:52.020
<v Speaker 2>literature on this as very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

197
00:11:52.021 --> 00:11:57.021
<v Speaker 2>very clear what you do with people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>are afraid and to some degree depressed </v>

198
00:11:57.021 --> 00:12:00.100
<v Speaker 2>but certainly anxious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is you lay out what what they're anxious</v>

199
00:12:00.101 --> 00:12:01.990
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all in detail.</v>

200
00:12:01.991 --> 00:12:04.240
<v Speaker 2>What is it that you're afraid of?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What might happen,</v>

201
00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:07.990
<v Speaker 2>and then you decompose it into small </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems,</v>

202
00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:10.000
<v Speaker 2>hypothetically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>manageable problems,</v>

203
00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:15.210
<v Speaker 2>and then you have the person expose </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves to the thing that they're </v>

204
00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:18.721
<v Speaker 2>afraid of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what happens isn't that they get </v>

205
00:12:18.721 --> 00:12:21.271
<v Speaker 2>less afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That isn't what the clinical literature </v>

206
00:12:21.271 --> 00:12:21.271
<v Speaker 2>indicates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

207
00:12:21.271 --> 00:12:24.100
<v Speaker 2>What happens instead is they get braver </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's not the same thing,</v>

208
00:12:24.101 --> 00:12:25.510
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if you get less afraid,</v>

209
00:12:25.511 --> 00:12:26.290
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

210
00:12:26.291 --> 00:12:28.270
<v Speaker 2>the world isn't as dangerous as I </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought it was.</v>

211
00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:29.260
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>silly me.</v>

212
00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:31.510
<v Speaker 2>If you get braver,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not what happens.</v>

213
00:12:31.511 --> 00:12:32.260
<v Speaker 2>What happens is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

214
00:12:32.261 --> 00:12:34.360
<v Speaker 2>the World Damn worlds just as dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 2>as I thought,</v>

215
00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:36.850
<v Speaker 2>or maybe it's even more dangerous than I</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>

216
00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:40.810
<v Speaker 2>but it turns out that there's something </v>
<v Speaker 2>in me that responds to taking that on as</v>

217
00:12:40.811 --> 00:12:44.320
<v Speaker 2>a voluntary challenge and grows and </v>
<v Speaker 2>thrives as a consequence,</v>

218
00:12:44.321 --> 00:12:49.321
<v Speaker 2>and there's no doubt about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even the psychophysiological findings </v>

219
00:12:49.321 --> 00:12:51.850
<v Speaker 2>are quite clear if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can.</v>

220
00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:56.530
<v Speaker 2>If you impose a stressor on two groups </v>
<v Speaker 2>of people and on one group,</v>

221
00:12:56.531 --> 00:13:00.280
<v Speaker 2>the stressor is imposed in voluntarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>and on the other group.</v>

222
00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:05.330
<v Speaker 2>Destresser is picked up voluntarily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The people who pick up the stress or </v>

223
00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:09.511
<v Speaker 2>voluntary voluntarily use a whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>different cycle physiological system to </v>

224
00:13:09.511 --> 00:13:13.471
<v Speaker 2>deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They use the system that's associated </v>

225
00:13:13.471 --> 00:13:16.021
<v Speaker 2>with approach and challenge and not the </v>
<v Speaker 2>system that's associated with defensive </v>

226
00:13:16.021 --> 00:13:19.960
<v Speaker 2>aggression and withdrawal and the system</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is associated with challenges,</v>

227
00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:24.990
<v Speaker 2>much more associated with positive </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotion and much less associated with </v>

228
00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:24.990
<v Speaker 2>negative emotion.</v>

229
00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:29.470
<v Speaker 2>It's also much less hard on you because </v>
<v Speaker 2>the defensive posturing system,</v>

230
00:13:29.471 --> 00:13:32.140
<v Speaker 2>the prey animal system man would not </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing kicks in.</v>

231
00:13:32.141 --> 00:13:37.141
<v Speaker 2>It's all systems are go for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know you're the gas is pushed down </v>

232
00:13:37.141 --> 00:13:41.401
<v Speaker 2>to the are the pedals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pushed down to the metal and the brakes </v>

233
00:13:41.401 --> 00:13:43.861
<v Speaker 2>are on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're using future resources that you </v>

234
00:13:43.861 --> 00:13:44.950
<v Speaker 2>could be storing for future time right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now in the present to ready yourself for</v>

235
00:13:44.951 --> 00:13:47.550
<v Speaker 2>emergency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>

236
00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:50.050
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing simple or trivial at all</v>

237
00:13:50.051 --> 00:13:55.051
<v Speaker 2>about the idea of being called to move </v>
<v Speaker 2>forthrightly forward into this strange </v>

238
00:13:55.051 --> 00:13:58.240
<v Speaker 2>and the unknown and there's a real </v>
<v Speaker 2>adventure that's associated with that,</v>

239
00:13:58.241 --> 00:14:00.100
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's an exciting thing,</v>

240
00:14:00.101 --> 00:14:02.020
<v Speaker 2>which is part of the reason why people </v>
<v Speaker 2>travel.</v>

241
00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:07.170
<v Speaker 2>And then also to see yourself as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of creature that can do that is </v>

242
00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:10.921
<v Speaker 2>willing to do that on a habitual basis </v>
<v Speaker 2>is also the right kind of tonic for,</v>

243
00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:12.880
<v Speaker 2>I hate this word for yourself.</v>

244
00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:14.350
<v Speaker 2>Esteem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

245
00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:17.710
<v Speaker 2>because the self esteem has nothing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do with feeling good about yourself.</v>

246
00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:18.970
<v Speaker 2>As a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I already mentioned,</v>

247
00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:23.350
<v Speaker 2>there isn't necessarily a reason why a </v>
<v Speaker 2>priority you should just feel good about</v>

248
00:14:23.351 --> 00:14:26.470
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you can view yourself acting in a</v>

249
00:14:26.471 --> 00:14:31.471
<v Speaker 2>courageous and forthright manner and </v>
<v Speaker 2>encountering the world and trying to </v>

250
00:14:31.471 --> 00:14:31.970
<v Speaker 2>improve your lot and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

251
00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:33.670
<v Speaker 2>and taking risks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

252
00:14:33.671 --> 00:14:38.671
<v Speaker 2>in a non naive way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well then you have something that you </v>

253
00:14:38.671 --> 00:14:41.191
<v Speaker 2>can comfort yourself with at night when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're wondering what the whole damn </v>

254
00:14:41.191 --> 00:14:45.151
<v Speaker 2>point of view of your few tiles and </v>
<v Speaker 2>miserable life and so and that's </v>

255
00:14:45.151 --> 00:14:50.011
<v Speaker 2>necessary because it's often the case </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you wake up at four in the morning </v>

256
00:14:50.011 --> 00:14:54.421
<v Speaker 2>or at least sometimes the case that wake</v>
<v Speaker 2>up at four in the morning when things </v>

257
00:14:54.421 --> 00:14:57.641
<v Speaker 2>haven't been going that well and wonder </v>
<v Speaker 2>just what the hell the point is of your </v>

258
00:14:57.641 --> 00:14:57.641
<v Speaker 2>futile and miserable life.</v>

259
00:14:57.710 --> 00:15:00.650
<v Speaker 2>You have to have something real to set </v>
<v Speaker 2>against that.</v>

260
00:15:00.651 --> 00:15:05.651
<v Speaker 2>It can't be just rationalizations about </v>
<v Speaker 2>how you know you're a valuable person </v>

261
00:15:05.651 --> 00:15:06.590
<v Speaker 2>among others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though that's true,</v>

262
00:15:06.591 --> 00:15:11.591
<v Speaker 2>that's not good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need something that's more </v>

263
00:15:11.591 --> 00:15:14.471
<v Speaker 2>realistic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To set a against that and observing </v>

264
00:15:14.471 --> 00:15:15.880
<v Speaker 2>courage in yourself is definitely one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the things that,</v>

265
00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:21.170
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that could help you sleep soundly at </v>

266
00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:23.381
<v Speaker 2>night when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when things are destabilized a little </v>

267
00:15:23.381 --> 00:15:25.550
<v Speaker 2>bit around you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So back to the Covenant,</v>

268
00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:30.700
<v Speaker 2>God tells Abraham,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will make my covenant between me and </v>

269
00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:33.851
<v Speaker 2>the and will multiply the exceedingly </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Abraham fell on his face and God </v>

270
00:15:33.851 --> 00:15:33.851
<v Speaker 2>talked with him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

271
00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:35.840
<v Speaker 2>as for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>behold my covenant,</v>

272
00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:40.870
<v Speaker 2>my contract is with thee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and thou shalt be a father of many </v>

273
00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:41.570
<v Speaker 2>nations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Neither shall thy name anymore be called</v>

274
00:15:41.571 --> 00:15:45.440
<v Speaker 2>Abraham name shall be called Abraham for</v>
<v Speaker 2>a father of many nations.</v>

275
00:15:45.441 --> 00:15:48.920
<v Speaker 2>Have I made the and Haber means hi </v>
<v Speaker 2>father and Abraham,</v>

276
00:15:48.921 --> 00:15:52.820
<v Speaker 2>father of a multitude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'll make the exceedingly fruitful.</v>

277
00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:59.040
<v Speaker 2>I will make nations of the and kings </v>
<v Speaker 2>shall come out of the and I will </v>

278
00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:03.740
<v Speaker 2>establish my covenant between me and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>anti seed after the in their generations</v>

279
00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:06.710
<v Speaker 2>for an everlasting covenant to be a God </v>
<v Speaker 2>unto Thee,</v>

280
00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:11.890
<v Speaker 2>unto thy seed after Thee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I will give unto thee and thy seed </v>

281
00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:12.350
<v Speaker 2>after the the land wherein thou art a </v>
<v Speaker 2>stranger,</v>

282
00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:15.500
<v Speaker 2>all the land of Canaan for an </v>
<v Speaker 2>everlasting possession.</v>

283
00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:18.440
<v Speaker 2>And I will be their God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that line.</v>

284
00:16:18.441 --> 00:16:22.400
<v Speaker 2>Really the line about the land where you</v>
<v Speaker 2>are a stranger,</v>

285
00:16:22.401 --> 00:16:27.401
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and everything that happens in the </v>

286
00:16:27.401 --> 00:16:29.621
<v Speaker 2>Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Almost everything that happens in these </v>

287
00:16:29.621 --> 00:16:30.260
<v Speaker 2>more archaic stories in particular is </v>
<v Speaker 2>laid out geographically.</v>

288
00:16:30.261 --> 00:16:35.261
<v Speaker 2>The metaphor is geographic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you moved to a land that you haven't </v>

289
00:16:35.261 --> 00:16:38.921
<v Speaker 2>yet occupied.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's full of strangers and then </v>

290
00:16:38.921 --> 00:16:41.651
<v Speaker 2>the land is what's granted to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's perfectly reasonable to think </v>

291
00:16:41.651 --> 00:16:45.011
<v Speaker 2>about this from the perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a more abstract perspective that's </v>

292
00:16:45.011 --> 00:16:46.700
<v Speaker 2>much more relevant to modern people with</v>
<v Speaker 2>are incredibly complex societies.</v>

293
00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:52.110
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely the case that if you go </v>

294
00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:55.991
<v Speaker 2>into the land of the stranger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is exactly what you do when you </v>

295
00:16:55.991 --> 00:16:55.991
<v Speaker 2>try out any new endeavor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

296
00:16:55.991 --> 00:17:00.221
<v Speaker 2>When you start a new job or when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>start a new educational enterprise and </v>

297
00:17:00.221 --> 00:17:00.830
<v Speaker 2>when you start a new relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter.</v>

298
00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:02.900
<v Speaker 2>You're out there and it's unexplored </v>
<v Speaker 2>territory.</v>

299
00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:07.490
<v Speaker 2>Like the physical geography is the same,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we don't live in the in,</v>

300
00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:09.560
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the spatial world only.</v>

301
00:17:09.561 --> 00:17:14.561
<v Speaker 2>We live in the temporal spatial world </v>
<v Speaker 2>and what that means is that the same </v>

302
00:17:14.561 --> 00:17:18.371
<v Speaker 2>place can be different at a different </v>
<v Speaker 2>time and mean it can be completely </v>

303
00:17:18.371 --> 00:17:19.700
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if you're in your house,</v>

304
00:17:19.701 --> 00:17:24.701
<v Speaker 2>but you have a new person in your house </v>
<v Speaker 2>while your house is new for all intents </v>

305
00:17:24.701 --> 00:17:28.511
<v Speaker 2>and purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the territory surrounding that </v>

306
00:17:28.511 --> 00:17:29.840
<v Speaker 2>new person is the territory of of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>foreigner essentially,</v>

307
00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:33.200
<v Speaker 2>and the same thing happens to you when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you start a new job and you'll find that</v>

308
00:17:33.201 --> 00:17:38.201
<v Speaker 2>when you start a new job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if you stretched yourself a </v>

309
00:17:38.201 --> 00:17:39.620
<v Speaker 2>little bit beyond your zone of comfort,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you very much feel like an imposter</v>

310
00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:41.120
<v Speaker 2>right when you're first there.</v>

311
00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:42.500
<v Speaker 2>And then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

312
00:17:42.501 --> 00:17:45.440
<v Speaker 2>how do you master that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the answer to that seems to be,</v>

313
00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:50.530
<v Speaker 2>while it seems fairly straightforward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the place that you're in has degree </v>

314
00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:51.960
<v Speaker 2>of possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it isn't inhabited by demons,</v>

315
00:17:51.961 --> 00:17:56.961
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best way to act is to lift your aim </v>

316
00:17:56.961 --> 00:18:00.711
<v Speaker 2>upward and attempt to get your act </v>
<v Speaker 2>together and to tell the truth and to </v>

317
00:18:00.711 --> 00:18:00.840
<v Speaker 2>live a meaningful life and to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult things.</v>

318
00:18:00.841 --> 00:18:05.841
<v Speaker 2>All of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that is the best way of mastering a </v>

319
00:18:05.841 --> 00:18:06.930
<v Speaker 2>new territory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in all probability,</v>

320
00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:11.960
<v Speaker 2>the degree to which you're able to act </v>
<v Speaker 2>that out is precisely proportionate to </v>

321
00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:14.610
<v Speaker 2>the degree to which you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>become a master in that territory.</v>

322
00:18:14.611 --> 00:18:17.160
<v Speaker 2>And that sort of thing can happen a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>faster than people think.</v>

323
00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:18.540
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

324
00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:22.320
<v Speaker 2>it's really quite remarkable how fast </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can move forward.</v>

325
00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:27.530
<v Speaker 2>If you can establish yourself somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 2>and prove yourself useful,</v>

326
00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:32.810
<v Speaker 2>assuming that you're around people to </v>
<v Speaker 2>whom proving yourself useful actually </v>

327
00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:37.011
<v Speaker 2>matters like I know perfectly well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can end up in an employment </v>

328
00:18:37.011 --> 00:18:37.740
<v Speaker 2>situation where you're punished for your</v>
<v Speaker 2>virtues,</v>

329
00:18:37.741 --> 00:18:38.010
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

330
00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:40.170
<v Speaker 2>In which case you should just get the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hell out of there.</v>

331
00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:45.290
<v Speaker 2>And really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really you get out of there and you go </v>

332
00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:46.080
<v Speaker 2>find somewhere where if you work hard to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do what you're supposed to do,</v>

333
00:18:46.081 --> 00:18:48.270
<v Speaker 2>you're actually going to be rewarded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

334
00:18:48.271 --> 00:18:51.000
<v Speaker 2>Because that's not a workplace that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>hell.</v>

335
00:18:51.001 --> 00:18:55.350
<v Speaker 2>And you should just leave there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So and God said unto Abraham,</v>

336
00:18:55.351 --> 00:18:57.150
<v Speaker 2>Thou shall keep my covenant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>therefore,</v>

337
00:18:57.151 --> 00:18:59.700
<v Speaker 2>Thou and thy seed after the in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>generations,</v>

338
00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:05.030
<v Speaker 2>this is my covenant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you shall keep between me and you </v>

339
00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:07.230
<v Speaker 2>and thy seed after the every man child </v>
<v Speaker 2>among you shall be circumcised.</v>

340
00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:08.730
<v Speaker 2>And it's a mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

341
00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:10.530
<v Speaker 2>why that particular?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

342
00:19:10.531 --> 00:19:11.730
<v Speaker 2>What's dramatic?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

343
00:19:11.731 --> 00:19:16.731
<v Speaker 2>it certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it certainly effects of man where he's </v>

344
00:19:16.731 --> 00:19:18.660
<v Speaker 2>most concerned to be affected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something like that.</v>

345
00:19:18.661 --> 00:19:22.320
<v Speaker 2>And so it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a sacrifice that has a certain,</v>

346
00:19:22.321 --> 00:19:24.510
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say a certain degree of </v>
<v Speaker 2>unforgettable it.</v>

347
00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:29.510
<v Speaker 2>That would be the first thing and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain degree of pain and threat that </v>

348
00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:29.760
<v Speaker 2>goes along with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not nothing.</v>

349
00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:35.120
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you can argue and I think there is </v>

350
00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:38.540
<v Speaker 2>an argument,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a case to be made about whether or not </v>

351
00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:41.160
<v Speaker 2>in the modern world circumcision is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasonable,</v>

352
00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:46.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is something reasonable to inflict on </v>

353
00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:48.921
<v Speaker 2>infants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to have that conversation </v>

354
00:19:48.921 --> 00:19:51.141
<v Speaker 2>at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think that's relevant to </v>

355
00:19:51.141 --> 00:19:53.760
<v Speaker 2>this particular issue because we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about something different.</v>

356
00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:58.780
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about humanities attempt </v>
<v Speaker 2>to reconcile themselves to the fact that</v>

357
00:20:00.331 --> 00:20:05.331
<v Speaker 2>something has to be given up in order </v>
<v Speaker 2>for something else to happen and to try </v>

358
00:20:05.331 --> 00:20:08.400
<v Speaker 2>to really work through that idea and to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make it into a psychological reality and</v>

359
00:20:08.401 --> 00:20:13.401
<v Speaker 2>so far what we've seen in the biblical </v>
<v Speaker 2>stories is that when you make a </v>

360
00:20:13.401 --> 00:20:16.731
<v Speaker 2>sacrifice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not really something personal or </v>

361
00:20:16.731 --> 00:20:16.731
<v Speaker 2>psychological,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

362
00:20:16.731 --> 00:20:18.840
<v Speaker 2>It's something external and dramatic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You give up something that you own.</v>

363
00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:22.830
<v Speaker 2>You don't give up something that you are</v>
<v Speaker 2>or that's part of you and it's.</v>

364
00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:27.840
<v Speaker 2>It's actually more of a sacrifice to </v>
<v Speaker 2>give up something that's a part of you </v>

365
00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:30.510
<v Speaker 2>or something that you are than to give </v>
<v Speaker 2>up something that you own.</v>

366
00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:35.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a subtle distinction because in </v>

367
00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:35.690
<v Speaker 2>some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the distinction between what you own and</v>

368
00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:37.740
<v Speaker 2>what you are is subtle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

369
00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:40.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's not overwhelmingly subtle </v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

370
00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:45.950
<v Speaker 2>But people identify with their </v>
<v Speaker 2>possessions and they need to because </v>

371
00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:46.980
<v Speaker 2>otherwise they wouldn't care for them </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they need their possessions in order</v>

372
00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:51.990
<v Speaker 2>to live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So their possessions are in some sense </v>

373
00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:54.310
<v Speaker 2>integral to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this transformation here have an act</v>

374
00:20:54.311 --> 00:20:59.311
<v Speaker 2>that was external and associated </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially with possessions to </v>

375
00:20:59.311 --> 00:21:00.940
<v Speaker 2>something that was actually at least </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the body,</v>

376
00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:04.600
<v Speaker 2>brings it much closer to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brings it much closer to the,</v>

377
00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:09.660
<v Speaker 2>to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the individual as a psychological </v>

378
00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:09.660
<v Speaker 2>reality.</v>

379
00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:12.480
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that and you shall </v>
<v Speaker 2>circumcise circumcised the flesh of your</v>

380
00:21:13.121 --> 00:21:17.020
<v Speaker 2>for skin and it shall be a token of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>covenant between me and you.</v>

381
00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:19.720
<v Speaker 2>It's also a permanent marker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

382
00:21:19.721 --> 00:21:24.160
<v Speaker 2>and I've read a fair bit about practices</v>
<v Speaker 2>like tattooing and body scarification,</v>

383
00:21:24.161 --> 00:21:24.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

384
00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:26.530
<v Speaker 2>those are very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very common practices,</v>

385
00:21:26.531 --> 00:21:28.480
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're human universals actually,</v>

386
00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:31.060
<v Speaker 2>no matter where you go around the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediacy,</v>

387
00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:32.320
<v Speaker 2>a couple of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

388
00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:37.500
<v Speaker 2>almost without exception,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people wear clothing and sometimes it's </v>

389
00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:40.000
<v Speaker 2>relatively minimal clothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's an often,</v>

390
00:21:40.001 --> 00:21:43.870
<v Speaker 2>it's more decorative than protective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's almost inevitably clothing.</v>

391
00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:49.350
<v Speaker 2>And the other thing that you see is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people do scar and tattoo themselves and</v>

392
00:21:49.421 --> 00:21:52.330
<v Speaker 2>they do that in some manner to catalyze </v>
<v Speaker 2>their identity,</v>

393
00:21:52.331 --> 00:21:57.331
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to transform themselves </v>

394
00:21:57.331 --> 00:22:00.091
<v Speaker 2>from a generic person in some sense to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>person that's been designed by their own</v>

395
00:22:00.881 --> 00:22:01.330
<v Speaker 2>hand.</v>

396
00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:03.130
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

397
00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:08.170
<v Speaker 2>it's a marker of developing identity and</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of it seems to be catalyzed with </v>

398
00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:08.530
<v Speaker 2>pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

399
00:22:08.531 --> 00:22:13.531
<v Speaker 2>the modern people who Tattoo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not saying that I'm in favor of </v>

400
00:22:13.531 --> 00:22:15.280
<v Speaker 2>tattooing because actually I'm not but </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

401
00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:19.150
<v Speaker 2>But that's my own particular bias and if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a tattoo that's fine with me.</v>

402
00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:23.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm also not saying that there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything wrong with it,</v>

403
00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:29.340
<v Speaker 2>but one of the things you do see what </v>
<v Speaker 2>the people who have a to tattoo do </v>

404
00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:33.661
<v Speaker 2>report is a couple of things is that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>pain is actually necessary and that the </v>

405
00:22:33.761 --> 00:22:37.210
<v Speaker 2>pain is actually something that seems to</v>
<v Speaker 2>establish something like a memory.</v>

406
00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:39.580
<v Speaker 2>So while it's a memory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of the pain,</v>

407
00:22:39.581 --> 00:22:41.470
<v Speaker 2>because he bloody well remember things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that hurt,</v>

408
00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:44.890
<v Speaker 2>but it's also a memory because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually etched on you,</v>

409
00:22:44.891 --> 00:22:49.891
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not something that you can just </v>

410
00:22:49.891 --> 00:22:49.891
<v Speaker 2>abandon and forget.</v>

411
00:22:49.891 --> 00:22:50.290
<v Speaker 2>And so a circumcision is exactly the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same thing.</v>

412
00:22:50.291 --> 00:22:55.291
<v Speaker 2>It's like you don't forget it because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's part of you and so it makes a good </v>

413
00:22:55.291 --> 00:22:58.330
<v Speaker 2>token for a covenant and so that seems </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be the rationale here from,</v>

414
00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:00.640
<v Speaker 2>from speaking from a psychological </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>

415
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.440
<v Speaker 2>it's to indicate as well that the damn </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that's happening is serious.</v>

416
00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:09.230
<v Speaker 2>And I think also that was the case with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the earlier sacrifices of animals.</v>

417
00:23:09.231 --> 00:23:11.890
<v Speaker 2>So it's like modern people don't do </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

418
00:23:11.891 --> 00:23:16.891
<v Speaker 2>Like you don't know how serious you </v>
<v Speaker 2>would take a vow with you sacrifice to </v>

419
00:23:16.891 --> 00:23:16.891
<v Speaker 2>go to in your back yard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

420
00:23:16.891 --> 00:23:18.910
<v Speaker 2>it's actually a very dramatic thing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

421
00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:24.270
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think about it as primitive and </v>

422
00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:24.270
<v Speaker 2>perhaps it is archaic and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

423
00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:25.380
<v Speaker 2>and no doubt it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also to,</v>

424
00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:27.760
<v Speaker 2>to take the life of something and to </v>
<v Speaker 2>spill its blood.</v>

425
00:23:27.761 --> 00:23:28.630
<v Speaker 2>That's no joke.</v>

426
00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:31.210
<v Speaker 2>That's something you remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if you haven't done it before</v>

427
00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:36.660
<v Speaker 2>and we actually don't know what we would</v>
<v Speaker 2>need to do in order to take something </v>

428
00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:36.940
<v Speaker 2>seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

429
00:23:36.941 --> 00:23:40.300
<v Speaker 2>because we all do things like make new </v>
<v Speaker 2>year's resolutions about how we're going</v>

430
00:23:40.301 --> 00:23:43.840
<v Speaker 2>to be better people and we don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that,</v>

431
00:23:43.841 --> 00:23:46.610
<v Speaker 2>at least in part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is because we don't know how to make the</v>

432
00:23:46.611 --> 00:23:50.150
<v Speaker 2>sacrifice sufficiently bloody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

433
00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:53.510
<v Speaker 2>so that we remember that it's necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

434
00:23:53.511 --> 00:23:58.511
<v Speaker 2>We don't take it with seriousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't think I should quit smoking </v>

435
00:23:58.511 --> 00:24:02.600
<v Speaker 2>because I'm gonna die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we don't think through what that </v>

436
00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:02.600
<v Speaker 2>means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like cat coughing,</v>

437
00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:04.100
<v Speaker 2>your lungs out for three months in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hotel bed.</v>

438
00:24:04.101 --> 00:24:08.210
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your entire family is like half repulsed</v>

439
00:24:08.211 --> 00:24:13.211
<v Speaker 2>and horrified and sorrow stricken at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fact that this has happened far too </v>

440
00:24:13.211 --> 00:24:13.211
<v Speaker 2>early.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

441
00:24:13.211 --> 00:24:16.070
<v Speaker 2>we won't make that real enough to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>it serious and serious.</v>

442
00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:18.050
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and without that seriousness,</v>

443
00:24:18.051 --> 00:24:23.051
<v Speaker 2>we won't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's something to be said for </v>

444
00:24:23.051 --> 00:24:25.190
<v Speaker 2>rituals of seriousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think this is one of them,</v>

445
00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:28.850
<v Speaker 2>and he that is eight days shall be </v>
<v Speaker 2>circumcised among you.</v>

446
00:24:28.851 --> 00:24:33.851
<v Speaker 2>Every man child in your generations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He that is born in the house or bought </v>

447
00:24:33.851 --> 00:24:34.880
<v Speaker 2>with money of any stranger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is not if they seed.</v>

448
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:39.020
<v Speaker 2>This is from Charles John Ellicott,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was bishop of Gloucester,</v>

449
00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:43.430
<v Speaker 2>the fitness of circumcision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To be a sign of entering into a covenant</v>

450
00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:48.970
<v Speaker 2>and especially into one to which </v>
<v Speaker 2>children were to be admitted consisted </v>

451
00:24:49.041 --> 00:24:54.041
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's being a representation of a new </v>

452
00:24:54.041 --> 00:24:55.871
<v Speaker 2>birth by putting off the old man and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>dedication of the new man unto holiness.</v>

453
00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:57.950
<v Speaker 2>It's like a baptism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

454
00:24:57.951 --> 00:24:58.820
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what's.</v>

455
00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:04.060
<v Speaker 2>That's what's echoed there and of course</v>
<v Speaker 2>a baptism is returned to the pre </v>

456
00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:07.550
<v Speaker 2>cosmogony chaos because that's what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>water indicates and return to the source</v>

457
00:25:07.551 --> 00:25:10.430
<v Speaker 2>of life and then the renewal that comes </v>
<v Speaker 2>along with it,</v>

458
00:25:10.431 --> 00:25:10.970
<v Speaker 2>so it's the.</v>

459
00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:11.560
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

460
00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:15.590
<v Speaker 2>it's a sacrificial idea in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>that if there is to be a new you,</v>

461
00:25:15.591 --> 00:25:20.591
<v Speaker 2>that the old you has to dissolve has to </v>
<v Speaker 2>return to the solution from which it </v>

462
00:25:20.931 --> 00:25:23.960
<v Speaker 2>emerged initially and to reconstitute </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>

463
00:25:23.961 --> 00:25:26.000
<v Speaker 2>And so there's an echo of that idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

464
00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:31.430
<v Speaker 2>The flesh was cast away that the spirit </v>
<v Speaker 2>might grow strong and the change of name</v>

465
00:25:31.431 --> 00:25:34.100
<v Speaker 2>and Abraham and Sarah was typical of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this change of condition.</v>

466
00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:39.280
<v Speaker 2>They had been born again and so must </v>
<v Speaker 2>again be named and the women could it </v>

467
00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:43.370
<v Speaker 2>need be admitted directly into the could</v>
<v Speaker 2>not indeed be admitted directly into the</v>

468
00:25:43.371 --> 00:25:48.371
<v Speaker 2>covenant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yet they shared in its privileges by </v>

469
00:25:48.371 --> 00:25:50.711
<v Speaker 2>virtue of their concert ingenuity to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>men who were sponsors for them and </v>

470
00:25:50.711 --> 00:25:54.851
<v Speaker 2>that's sariah changes her name equally </v>
<v Speaker 2>with your husband or you could make a </v>

471
00:25:54.851 --> 00:25:58.331
<v Speaker 2>case and and anthropological observers </v>
<v Speaker 2>have made this case to that women </v>

472
00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:03.340
<v Speaker 2>undergo a sufficiently a set of </v>
<v Speaker 2>sufficiently radical psychophysiological</v>

473
00:26:03.351 --> 00:26:06.890
<v Speaker 2>transformations merely as a consequence </v>
<v Speaker 2>of being part,</v>

474
00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:12.430
<v Speaker 2>being feminine in nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>such that the additional rituals of </v>

475
00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:17.411
<v Speaker 2>transformation that might be necessary </v>
<v Speaker 2>for men aren't necessarily in one of </v>

476
00:26:17.411 --> 00:26:20.921
<v Speaker 2>those might be menstruation because </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a pretty dramatic transformation </v>

477
00:26:20.921 --> 00:26:23.720
<v Speaker 2>and there has been some indication that </v>
<v Speaker 2>circumcision is like a male.</v>

478
00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:26.270
<v Speaker 2>It's like the male equivalent of </v>
<v Speaker 2>menstruation.</v>

479
00:26:26.271 --> 00:26:31.271
<v Speaker 2>Something like that because of the blood</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's involved and because of the </v>

480
00:26:31.271 --> 00:26:31.490
<v Speaker 2>locale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then of course the same thing as the</v>

481
00:26:31.491 --> 00:26:36.491
<v Speaker 2>case with women when they give birth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that's a particularly dramatic </v>

482
00:26:36.491 --> 00:26:38.720
<v Speaker 2>thing as I just witnessed because my </v>
<v Speaker 2>daughter just had a baby this week.</v>

483
00:26:38.721 --> 00:26:38.930
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

484
00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:39.930
<v Speaker 3>for that</v>

485
00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:55.380
<v Speaker 2>recent investigation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is from the Cambridge Bible for </v>

486
00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:58.531
<v Speaker 2>school and colleges,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which if you want to read it is only 58 </v>

487
00:26:58.531 --> 00:27:01.921
<v Speaker 2>volumes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Reasoned investigation is not tended to </v>

488
00:27:01.921 --> 00:27:06.331
<v Speaker 2>support the theory that circumcision has</v>
<v Speaker 2>any connection with primitive child </v>

489
00:27:06.331 --> 00:27:06.580
<v Speaker 2>sacrifice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nor again,</v>

490
00:27:06.581 --> 00:27:08.680
<v Speaker 2>that it took its origin from hygienic </v>
<v Speaker 2>motives.</v>

491
00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:14.010
<v Speaker 2>Apparently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it record represents the dedication of </v>

492
00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:14.500
<v Speaker 2>the manhood of the people to God in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>history of Israel.</v>

493
00:27:14.501 --> 00:27:19.501
<v Speaker 2>It has survived as the symbol of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people belonging to Jehovah through his </v>

494
00:27:19.501 --> 00:27:21.700
<v Speaker 2>special election.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This corporeal sacrament remained to the</v>

495
00:27:21.701 --> 00:27:25.180
<v Speaker 2>Israelite when every other type of </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion or race had been severed.</v>

496
00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:28.190
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

497
00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:39.580
<v Speaker 2>the other thing that that I read about </v>
<v Speaker 2>in relationship to this idea of the </v>

498
00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:44.181
<v Speaker 2>multigenerational covenant had something</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do because God told Abraham to </v>

499
00:27:44.181 --> 00:27:49.130
<v Speaker 2>include all of the people of his </v>
<v Speaker 2>household into this covenant and and </v>

500
00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:49.600
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

501
00:27:49.630 --> 00:27:51.920
<v Speaker 2>that really meant that he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>establishing it,</v>

502
00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:54.960
<v Speaker 2>a territory of ethics around them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the arc,</v>

503
00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:57.390
<v Speaker 2>except the psychological equivalent of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the arch.</v>

504
00:27:57.391 --> 00:27:57.990
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was,</v>

505
00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:03.350
<v Speaker 2>it was a spiritual or psychological or </v>
<v Speaker 2>ethical territory that everyone who is </v>

506
00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:08.091
<v Speaker 2>of that household was required to occupy</v>
<v Speaker 2>or obliged or perhaps privileged to </v>

507
00:28:09.211 --> 00:28:14.211
<v Speaker 2>occupy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there was also an injunction to </v>

508
00:28:14.211 --> 00:28:17.271
<v Speaker 2>Abraham with regards to his children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was that as he had established a </v>

509
00:28:17.271 --> 00:28:19.110
<v Speaker 2>covenant with God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we could say is something like his</v>

510
00:28:19.111 --> 00:28:24.111
<v Speaker 2>decision to to aim as high as possible </v>
<v Speaker 2>and to live properly as a consequence.</v>

511
00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:27.000
<v Speaker 2>It's more than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's something like that,</v>

512
00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:32.180
<v Speaker 2>that he also was under a sub,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the supreme moral obligation to share </v>

513
00:28:32.761 --> 00:28:35.280
<v Speaker 2>that with his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the other men in his family,</v>

514
00:28:35.281 --> 00:28:38.010
<v Speaker 2>especially as children and so and so.</v>

515
00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:42.330
<v Speaker 2>I think there's also a call here to </v>
<v Speaker 2>adopting a sacred,</v>

516
00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:47.390
<v Speaker 2>the sacred responsibility in </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship to children that has to do </v>

517
00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:50.670
<v Speaker 2>with ensuring that they understand how </v>
<v Speaker 2>to take their place in the world.</v>

518
00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:56.090
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that's definitely </v>
<v Speaker 2>something very much worth considering,</v>

519
00:28:56.970 --> 00:29:01.470
<v Speaker 2>especially given the emphasis in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Noah story and the story of Noah,</v>

520
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.820
<v Speaker 2>that Noah had his.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That his generations were perfect.</v>

521
00:29:05.821 --> 00:29:07.650
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>As I said before,</v>

522
00:29:07.651 --> 00:29:09.890
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't merely that he had walked with</v>
<v Speaker 2>God.</v>

523
00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:12.630
<v Speaker 2>He had perfected his own relationship </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the divine,</v>

524
00:29:12.631 --> 00:29:15.240
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the transcendent and I want to make</v>

525
00:29:15.241 --> 00:29:20.241
<v Speaker 2>that concrete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a strange thing to do with the </v>

526
00:29:20.241 --> 00:29:22.671
<v Speaker 2>transcendent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean people ask me all the time about </v>

527
00:29:22.671 --> 00:29:25.860
<v Speaker 2>what I believe and of course that's what</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to explain while I'm talking,</v>

528
00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:27.300
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

529
00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:29.580
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

530
00:29:29.581 --> 00:29:34.581
<v Speaker 2>and many people of course are skeptical </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the idea of anything transcendent </v>

531
00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:35.780
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

532
00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:39.840
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and say transcendent eternal.</v>

533
00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:46.110
<v Speaker 2>But that can also be addressed from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychological perspective because I </v>

534
00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:46.110
<v Speaker 2>would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

535
00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:51.310
<v Speaker 2>if you have an ideal of any sort,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how is that not transcendent?</v>

536
00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:54.700
<v Speaker 2>It transcends you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the first thing.</v>

537
00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:59.230
<v Speaker 2>And it doesn't exist in reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It exists in a place of possibility.</v>

538
00:29:59.231 --> 00:30:00.550
<v Speaker 2>And believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

539
00:30:00.551 --> 00:30:03.250
<v Speaker 2>we treat places of possibility as if </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're real.</v>

540
00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:08.460
<v Speaker 2>Because people will call on you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know about your possibility to your </v>

541
00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:08.890
<v Speaker 2>potential.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll say to you,</v>

542
00:30:08.891 --> 00:30:10.960
<v Speaker 2>you're not manifesting your full </v>
<v Speaker 2>potential.</v>

543
00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:12.310
<v Speaker 2>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

544
00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:14.950
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean by that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Potential?</v>

545
00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:18.190
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It isn't here now.</v>

546
00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:21.280
<v Speaker 2>You can't measure it or way it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't get a grip on it.</v>

547
00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:26.780
<v Speaker 2>And they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't rationalize you know perfectly </v>

548
00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:28.030
<v Speaker 2>well what I mean when I'm talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>your potential and so we could.</v>

549
00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:31.510
<v Speaker 2>Then you do and everyone does and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone knows exactly what that means,</v>

550
00:30:31.511 --> 00:30:36.511
<v Speaker 2>and so that's a metaphysical reality </v>
<v Speaker 2>that will immediately accept as real and</v>

551
00:30:36.611 --> 00:30:39.900
<v Speaker 2>also castigate ourselves for not </v>
<v Speaker 2>fulfilling and others too,</v>

552
00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:42.640
<v Speaker 2>because you're just not happy when the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people around you,</v>

553
00:30:42.641 --> 00:30:45.460
<v Speaker 2>especially if you love them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't fulfill their potential.</v>

554
00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:50.460
<v Speaker 2>You really feel that something has gone </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong and so there's a transcendent </v>

555
00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:53.791
<v Speaker 2>reality and potential,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then when you hypothesize an ideal </v>

556
00:30:53.791 --> 00:30:54.760
<v Speaker 2>that you might pursue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you always do,</v>

557
00:30:54.761 --> 00:30:59.761
<v Speaker 2>if you pursue anything right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because to pursue something means you </v>

558
00:30:59.761 --> 00:31:03.661
<v Speaker 2>don't already have it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're pursuing something that doesn't </v>

559
00:31:03.661 --> 00:31:06.301
<v Speaker 2>exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're probably not pursuing something </v>

560
00:31:06.301 --> 00:31:08.881
<v Speaker 2>that's worse than what you already have </v>
<v Speaker 2>because why the hell would you pursue </v>

561
00:31:08.881 --> 00:31:08.881
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

562
00:31:08.881 --> 00:31:13.381
<v Speaker 2>That's completely counterproductive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in the in the mere fact of your </v>

563
00:31:13.381 --> 00:31:13.381
<v Speaker 2>pursuit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

564
00:31:13.381 --> 00:31:17.020
<v Speaker 2>you pause it at transcendent reality </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can,</v>

565
00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:20.410
<v Speaker 2>that you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can journey towards,</v>

566
00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:23.140
<v Speaker 2>that's more valuable than the reality </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you have.</v>

567
00:31:23.141 --> 00:31:28.141
<v Speaker 2>Now that's predicated in some sense on </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like an eternal verity or an </v>

568
00:31:28.141 --> 00:31:32.701
<v Speaker 2>eternal truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It partakes in the ideal and so we have </v>

569
00:31:32.771 --> 00:31:35.710
<v Speaker 2>an relationship with the transcendent </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you might say,</v>

570
00:31:35.711 --> 00:31:40.711
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't mean you have to personify </v>

571
00:31:40.711 --> 00:31:40.711
<v Speaker 2>the transcendent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say as Jehovah,</v>

572
00:31:40.711 --> 00:31:40.870
<v Speaker 2>you know the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the God,</v>

573
00:31:40.871 --> 00:31:45.871
<v Speaker 2>the father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's also some damn good reasons </v>

574
00:31:45.871 --> 00:31:48.430
<v Speaker 2>for doing that because one of the things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I've realized thinking through this</v>

575
00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:52.060
<v Speaker 2>covenant idea and also the sacrifice </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea,</v>

576
00:31:52.061 --> 00:31:57.061
<v Speaker 2>is that the idea that the future is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>judgmental father is a really,</v>

577
00:31:57.431 --> 00:31:58.870
<v Speaker 2>really good idea.</v>

578
00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:04.250
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you think about what the future </v>

579
00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:04.250
<v Speaker 2>is in part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the future is however,</v>

580
00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:08.491
<v Speaker 2>the natural world is going to lay itself</v>
<v Speaker 2>out over the next endless amount of </v>

581
00:32:08.491 --> 00:32:08.980
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That isn't what I mean.</v>

582
00:32:08.981 --> 00:32:13.981
<v Speaker 2>I think more about your future now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mostly your future is the future that </v>

583
00:32:13.981 --> 00:32:15.850
<v Speaker 2>you're going to negotiate with other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

584
00:32:15.851 --> 00:32:20.851
<v Speaker 2>but they're going to be other people in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the future and some of those people are </v>

585
00:32:20.851 --> 00:32:22.150
<v Speaker 2>going to be you in the future and family</v>
<v Speaker 2>members in the future.</v>

586
00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:27.420
<v Speaker 2>And so what's happening right now is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that if you make the sacrifices </v>

587
00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:31.350
<v Speaker 2>properly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're actually pleasing that </v>

588
00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:34.711
<v Speaker 2>future set of people and that future set</v>
<v Speaker 2>of people is definitely going to serve </v>

589
00:32:34.711 --> 00:32:36.670
<v Speaker 2>as a judge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's exactly what it does.</v>

590
00:32:36.910 --> 00:32:39.070
<v Speaker 2>That's precisely what it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you might say,</v>

591
00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:44.080
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was the brilliant imagination of </v>

592
00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:46.511
<v Speaker 2>mankind that hypothesize that the best </v>
<v Speaker 2>way to think about the social group,</v>

593
00:32:47.121 --> 00:32:50.360
<v Speaker 2>including the family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he also including you as your future</v>

594
00:32:50.361 --> 00:32:55.361
<v Speaker 2>self,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was to consider that you live in </v>

595
00:32:55.361 --> 00:32:56.900
<v Speaker 2>relationship with a future father who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>a judge.</v>

596
00:32:57.420 --> 00:32:58.460
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

597
00:32:58.970 --> 00:33:01.340
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now is it right,</v>

598
00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:02.840
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or is it psychologically?</v>

599
00:33:02.841 --> 00:33:03.260
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

600
00:33:03.261 --> 00:33:05.480
<v Speaker 2>it's at least psychologically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

601
00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:11.050
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things I've learned about</v>
<v Speaker 2>the biblical stories is that to say that</v>

602
00:33:11.391 --> 00:33:16.340
<v Speaker 2>they're psychologically right doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>exhaust the ways in which they're right,</v>

603
00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:22.090
<v Speaker 2>but it at least gives rational,</v>
<v Speaker 2>modern people who are skeptical and </v>

604
00:33:22.090 --> 00:33:26.501
<v Speaker 2>properly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a better way of getting a grip on </v>

605
00:33:26.501 --> 00:33:26.501
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

606
00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:33.040
<v Speaker 2>and the uncircumcised man child whose </v>
<v Speaker 2>flesh of his foreskin is not </v>

607
00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:36.401
<v Speaker 2>circumcised.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That soul shall be cut off from his </v>

608
00:33:36.401 --> 00:33:36.401
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has broken my covenant,</v>

609
00:33:36.401 --> 00:33:39.020
<v Speaker 2>so it's a serious contractual array </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship.</v>

610
00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:44.470
<v Speaker 2>Now I was thinking about how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand this and I remember this old </v>

611
00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:45.620
<v Speaker 2>story which I'm going to read to you </v>
<v Speaker 2>about a monkey.</v>

612
00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:51.160
<v Speaker 2>So there's an old impossibly apocryphal </v>
<v Speaker 2>story about how to catch a monkey that </v>

613
00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:53.240
<v Speaker 2>illustrates this set of ideas very well </v>
<v Speaker 2>first.</v>

614
00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:57.620
<v Speaker 2>So it goes to the story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to find a large narrow neck jar</v>

615
00:33:57.650 --> 00:34:01.190
<v Speaker 2>just barely wide enough in diameter for </v>
<v Speaker 2>a monkey to put his hand inside.</v>

616
00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:06.640
<v Speaker 2>And then you have to fill the jar up </v>
<v Speaker 2>with rocks so that it's too heavy for </v>

617
00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:10.841
<v Speaker 2>the monkey to carry away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you scatter some treats around </v>

618
00:34:10.841 --> 00:34:13.880
<v Speaker 2>the jar that are attractive to monkeys </v>
<v Speaker 2>and close to the jar.</v>

619
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.670
<v Speaker 2>And then you put a few of those treats </v>
<v Speaker 2>inside the jar.</v>

620
00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:18.230
<v Speaker 2>And so that's the first part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>trick.</v>

621
00:34:18.231 --> 00:34:23.231
<v Speaker 2>And then the second part of the trick is</v>
<v Speaker 2>the monkey comes along and gathers up </v>

622
00:34:23.231 --> 00:34:26.321
<v Speaker 2>the treats and then puts his hand in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>jar and grabs the treats that are in </v>

623
00:34:26.321 --> 00:34:27.400
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's narrow necked.</v>

624
00:34:27.410 --> 00:34:31.130
<v Speaker 2>And so once the monkey puts his hand in </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and grabs the goodies and he can't</v>

625
00:34:31.131 --> 00:34:36.131
<v Speaker 2>get his hand out of the damn jar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so then you can just come along and </v>

626
00:34:36.131 --> 00:34:39.521
<v Speaker 2>pick up the monkey and like too bad for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the monkey writes like he should have </v>

627
00:34:39.521 --> 00:34:42.140
<v Speaker 2>let go of what he had so that something </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible didn't happen to them.</v>

628
00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:47.800
<v Speaker 2>But that isn't what the monkey will do </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he can't sacrifice the part for </v>

629
00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:51.401
<v Speaker 2>the whole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's something about the </v>

630
00:34:51.401 --> 00:34:54.610
<v Speaker 2>circumcision story that's about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about sacrificing the part to save </v>

631
00:34:54.610 --> 00:34:59.021
<v Speaker 2>the whole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean there's an echo of that in </v>

632
00:34:59.021 --> 00:34:59.021
<v Speaker 2>the New Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I remember correctly.</v>

633
00:34:59.021 --> 00:35:01.100
<v Speaker 2>I believe it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe this is correct.</v>

634
00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:06.270
<v Speaker 2>Although it might not be where Christ </v>
<v Speaker 2>tells his disciples to pluck out there.</v>

635
00:35:06.381 --> 00:35:07.700
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it offends them,</v>

636
00:35:07.850 --> 00:35:11.290
<v Speaker 2>seems like a very dramatic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

637
00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:14.480
<v Speaker 2>piece of advice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's partaking of the same idea,</v>

638
00:35:14.481 --> 00:35:18.320
<v Speaker 2>which is that now if there's something </v>
<v Speaker 2>holding you back,</v>

639
00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:23.360
<v Speaker 2>we'll see this when we get to the story </v>
<v Speaker 2>of law to if there's something holding </v>

640
00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:23.480
<v Speaker 2>you back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if it's dear to you,</v>

641
00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:29.380
<v Speaker 2>you have to let it go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You seriously have to let it go because </v>

642
00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:33.071
<v Speaker 2>there isn't anything more important than</v>
<v Speaker 2>progressing forward and and cheap </v>

643
00:35:33.071 --> 00:35:34.430
<v Speaker 2>sympathy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cheap empathy,</v>

644
00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:37.980
<v Speaker 2>cheap nostalgia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of that</v>

645
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:43.040
<v Speaker 1>is sufficient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of that will work because the </v>

646
00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:46.401
<v Speaker 1>consequences of not putting things </v>
<v Speaker 1>together immediately are dire and </v>

647
00:35:46.401 --> 00:35:47.130
<v Speaker 1>there's no time to wait.</v>

648
00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:52.330
<v Speaker 1>And God said unto Abraham,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as for my wife,</v>

649
00:35:52.331 --> 00:35:55.180
<v Speaker 1>thou shalt not call her name's Sarah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Sarah shall be her name.</v>

650
00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:57.480
<v Speaker 1>My princess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was Sarah.</v>

651
00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:02.720
<v Speaker 1>Sarah is mother of nations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I will bless her and give the a son </v>

652
00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:02.740
<v Speaker 1>also have her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yay.</v>

653
00:36:02.741 --> 00:36:04.810
<v Speaker 1>I will bless her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She will be a mother of nations.</v>

654
00:36:04.811 --> 00:36:09.811
<v Speaker 1>Kings of people shall be of her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then Abraham fell on his face and </v>

655
00:36:09.811 --> 00:36:11.260
<v Speaker 1>laughed and said in his heart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>show a child,</v>

656
00:36:11.261 --> 00:36:13.360
<v Speaker 1>be born unto him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is 100 years old.</v>

657
00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:15.190
<v Speaker 1>He's got a lot of doll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>

658
00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:17.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's God talking to him.</v>

659
00:36:17.231 --> 00:36:18.190
<v Speaker 1>Many laughs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

660
00:36:18.191 --> 00:36:23.191
<v Speaker 1>but that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's he's a courageous guy and that's </v>

661
00:36:23.191 --> 00:36:23.890
<v Speaker 1>what people are like and and she'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sarah,</v>

662
00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:27.460
<v Speaker 1>that is 90 years old bear and Abraham </v>
<v Speaker 1>said unto God,</v>

663
00:36:27.461 --> 00:36:29.560
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Ishmael might live before the.</v>

664
00:36:30.570 --> 00:36:31.840
<v Speaker 1>And God said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sarah,</v>

665
00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:36.280
<v Speaker 1>thy wife shall bear the son indeed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and thou shalt call his name Isaac,</v>

666
00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:39.700
<v Speaker 1>and I will establish my covenant with </v>
<v Speaker 1>him for an everlasting covenant and with</v>

667
00:36:39.701 --> 00:36:42.010
<v Speaker 1>his seed after him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as for Ishmael,</v>

668
00:36:42.370 --> 00:36:47.370
<v Speaker 1>I've heard the behold I have blessed him</v>
<v Speaker 1>and will make him fruitful and multiply </v>

669
00:36:47.370 --> 00:36:50.470
<v Speaker 1>him exceedingly 12 princes shall he be </v>
<v Speaker 1>get and I will make him a great nation.</v>

670
00:36:51.370 --> 00:36:52.630
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does this mean?</v>

671
00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:58.060
<v Speaker 1>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a miraculous story in some </v>

672
00:36:58.060 --> 00:36:58.060
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

673
00:36:58.060 --> 00:36:58.060
<v Speaker 1>Because.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

674
00:36:58.060 --> 00:37:01.951
<v Speaker 1>Sarah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's what Isaac want or what Abraham </v>

675
00:37:01.951 --> 00:37:04.861
<v Speaker 1>wants most is to have a song,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it looks like it's pretty much </v>

676
00:37:04.861 --> 00:37:07.321
<v Speaker 1>impossible and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what the story is attempting to </v>

677
00:37:07.321 --> 00:37:07.321
<v Speaker 1>indicate is something like</v>

678
00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:14.170
<v Speaker 1>God only knows what will happen to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you put your house in order.</v>

679
00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:17.830
<v Speaker 1>Certainly things that you do not </v>
<v Speaker 1>currently,</v>

680
00:37:17.831 --> 00:37:22.831
<v Speaker 1>regardless possible will happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the more you put your house in </v>

681
00:37:23.351 --> 00:37:28.351
<v Speaker 1>order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more things that you regard as </v>

682
00:37:28.351 --> 00:37:30.430
<v Speaker 1>impossible will happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it might be the case that if you put</v>

683
00:37:30.431 --> 00:37:35.431
<v Speaker 1>your host together sufficiently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that were of miraculous </v>

684
00:37:35.431 --> 00:37:39.331
<v Speaker 1>impossibility would happen to you well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's no way of knowing until you </v>

685
00:37:39.331 --> 00:37:43.771
<v Speaker 1>try it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's no way of being sure that </v>

686
00:37:43.771 --> 00:37:45.580
<v Speaker 1>it's not the case unless you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my experience has been</v>

687
00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:51.780
<v Speaker 4>that I don't mean just personally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that</v>

688
00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:57.790
<v Speaker 1>the world is a remarkable and mysterious</v>
<v Speaker 1>place and the relationship between the </v>

689
00:37:57.861 --> 00:38:01.310
<v Speaker 1>nature and structure of the world and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your actions is indeterminant.</v>

690
00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:03.800
<v Speaker 1>They may be more tightly related than </v>
<v Speaker 1>you think.</v>

691
00:38:04.370 --> 00:38:09.370
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know how to square that with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that while you're obviously in </v>

692
00:38:09.370 --> 00:38:13.460
<v Speaker 1>a mortal body and constrained by all </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of serious</v>

693
00:38:14.730 --> 00:38:15.540
<v Speaker 4>constraints,</v>

694
00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:20.280
<v Speaker 1>none of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of that's true.</v>

695
00:38:20.281 --> 00:38:25.281
<v Speaker 1>It can be trivially overcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't really understand how there </v>

696
00:38:25.281 --> 00:38:29.241
<v Speaker 1>can be that seriousness of mortal </v>
<v Speaker 1>constraint and the infinite potential </v>

697
00:38:29.761 --> 00:38:33.450
<v Speaker 1>that also seems to characterize human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings all at the same time.</v>

698
00:38:33.451 --> 00:38:36.550
<v Speaker 1>But then I don't really understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything about the nature of reality.</v>

699
00:38:36.551 --> 00:38:39.130
<v Speaker 1>So that's just one more mystery to add </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the pile.</v>

700
00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:42.790
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my covenant,</v>

701
00:38:42.791 --> 00:38:46.160
<v Speaker 1>I will establish this Isaac,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which share a Sarah shall bear under the</v>

702
00:38:46.170 --> 00:38:51.170
<v Speaker 1>at the set time next year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he left off talking with them and </v>

703
00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:52.300
<v Speaker 1>God went up from Abraham and Abraham </v>
<v Speaker 1>took Ishmael,</v>

704
00:38:52.301 --> 00:38:57.301
<v Speaker 1>his son and all that were born in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>house and all that were bought with his </v>

705
00:38:57.301 --> 00:39:00.121
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every male among the men of Abraham's </v>

706
00:39:00.121 --> 00:39:01.030
<v Speaker 1>house and circumcised the flesh of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>forest skin in the selfsame day,</v>

707
00:39:01.031 --> 00:39:06.031
<v Speaker 1>as God had said unto him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that must have been an interesting </v>

708
00:39:06.031 --> 00:39:08.320
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's been really.</v>

709
00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:10.420
<v Speaker 1>This is what God told you to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A.</v>

710
00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:11.680
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

711
00:39:14.410 --> 00:39:17.440
<v Speaker 1>And Abraham was 90 years old and nine </v>
<v Speaker 1>when he was circumcised,</v>

712
00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:19.450
<v Speaker 1>circumcised in the flesh of his for </v>
<v Speaker 1>skin.</v>

713
00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:24.660
<v Speaker 1>And Ishmael was 13 years old when he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>circumcised in the selfsame day was </v>

714
00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:27.340
<v Speaker 1>Abraham circumcised and his son and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the men of his house,</v>

715
00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:32.430
<v Speaker 1>born in the house and bought with money </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the stranger were circumcised with </v>

716
00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:34.040
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright?</v>

717
00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:37.210
<v Speaker 1>So that's the renewal of the covenant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the next part of the story.</v>

718
00:39:37.211 --> 00:39:39.670
<v Speaker 1>That's the circumstance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the circumcision story,</v>

719
00:39:39.671 --> 00:39:44.671
<v Speaker 1>and as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to indicate to me something </v>

720
00:39:44.671 --> 00:39:47.941
<v Speaker 1>about seriousness of intent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something about the responsibility that </v>

721
00:39:49.181 --> 00:39:52.810
<v Speaker 1>Abraham determines to take for everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's part of his household,</v>

722
00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:58.260
<v Speaker 1>these psychological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>increasing psychological transformation </v>

723
00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:01.951
<v Speaker 1>of the idea of sacrifice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the necessity of doing something </v>

724
00:40:01.951 --> 00:40:03.850
<v Speaker 1>memorable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the the,</v>

725
00:40:04.270 --> 00:40:09.270
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the utility of rekindling the aims of </v>

726
00:40:09.701 --> 00:40:13.540
<v Speaker 1>your highest values when you come to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>end of an air park in your life,</v>

727
00:40:13.810 --> 00:40:16.150
<v Speaker 1>when you have to take stock again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

728
00:40:16.270 --> 00:40:21.270
<v Speaker 1>You take stock of yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really what that phrase means to </v>

729
00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:21.640
<v Speaker 1>take stock as to take stock of yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>and to decide,</v>

730
00:40:21.641 --> 00:40:26.641
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what should move forward in time </v>

731
00:40:26.641 --> 00:40:30.091
<v Speaker 1>with me and what should be let go as if </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's dead wood and the more dead wood </v>

732
00:40:30.191 --> 00:40:33.340
<v Speaker 1>that you let go of and burn off when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have the opportunity.</v>

733
00:40:33.341 --> 00:40:38.341
<v Speaker 1>The last it accretes around you here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's something interesting about </v>

734
00:40:38.341 --> 00:40:38.341
<v Speaker 1>forest fires.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

735
00:40:38.341 --> 00:40:40.630
<v Speaker 1>people have been trying to prevent </v>
<v Speaker 1>forest fires for a long time,</v>

736
00:40:40.631 --> 00:40:42.790
<v Speaker 1>especially that am bear smokey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

737
00:40:42.791 --> 00:40:47.791
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to prevent forest fires and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so because forest fires burn up the </v>

738
00:40:47.791 --> 00:40:51.820
<v Speaker 1>forest and that can't be good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here's what happens if you don't let</v>

739
00:40:51.821 --> 00:40:56.821
<v Speaker 1>forest fires burn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that while forests collect a lot of </v>

740
00:40:56.821 --> 00:40:58.210
<v Speaker 1>dry branches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

741
00:40:58.211 --> 00:41:03.211
<v Speaker 1>because tree branches die and would </v>
<v Speaker 1>falls on the forest floor and collects,</v>

742
00:41:04.031 --> 00:41:09.031
<v Speaker 1>and so the amount of flammable material </v>
<v Speaker 1>keeps increasing with time and that's </v>

743
00:41:10.361 --> 00:41:15.361
<v Speaker 1>not so bad if it's wet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if the amount of flammable material </v>

744
00:41:15.361 --> 00:41:17.890
<v Speaker 1>is increasing and it gets really dry and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it burns,</v>

745
00:41:18.070 --> 00:41:19.360
<v Speaker 1>then you have a real problem.</v>

746
00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:25.080
<v Speaker 1>The forest fire can burn so hot that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>burns the topsoil right off,</v>

747
00:41:26.410 --> 00:41:28.300
<v Speaker 1>in which case you don't have a forest at</v>
<v Speaker 1>all anymore.</v>

748
00:41:28.301 --> 00:41:33.301
<v Speaker 1>You just have a desert and low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lots of trees are evolved to withstand </v>

749
00:41:33.301 --> 00:41:37.531
<v Speaker 1>forest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a certain intensity and some won't </v>

750
00:41:37.531 --> 00:41:38.750
<v Speaker 1>even release their seeds unless there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>been a fire,</v>

751
00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:43.990
<v Speaker 1>and so a little bit of fire at the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>time can stop everything from burning to</v>

752
00:41:44.331 --> 00:41:48.500
<v Speaker 1>the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's also a really useful insight,</v>

753
00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:51.080
<v Speaker 1>metaphorical insight into the nature of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice,</v>

754
00:41:51.081 --> 00:41:56.081
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also a lot easier to let go of </v>

755
00:41:56.081 --> 00:41:58.751
<v Speaker 1>something when you're deciding to let go</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it because you've decided yourself </v>

756
00:41:58.751 --> 00:42:00.440
<v Speaker 1>that you're done with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a weak part of you.</v>

757
00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:03.410
<v Speaker 1>It needs to disappear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do that yourself.</v>

758
00:42:03.411 --> 00:42:08.000
<v Speaker 1>It's much better and much easier than it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is if it's taken away from you forcibly,</v>

759
00:42:08.001 --> 00:42:09.770
<v Speaker 1>in which case you're very much likely to</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight it.</v>

760
00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:13.520
<v Speaker 1>These other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's another interesting thing here,</v>

761
00:42:13.730 --> 00:42:16.190
<v Speaker 1>a motif that runs through the entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bible.</v>

762
00:42:16.191 --> 00:42:21.191
<v Speaker 1>It's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very powerful motif and it's partly </v>

763
00:42:21.191 --> 00:42:23.741
<v Speaker 1>associated with this idea of walking </v>
<v Speaker 1>with or walking before God and in the </v>

764
00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:26.660
<v Speaker 1>New Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ says something like,</v>

765
00:42:27.090 --> 00:42:32.090
<v Speaker 1>my fathers will be done and he means </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that will should be done through </v>

766
00:42:32.090 --> 00:42:35.450
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I can't.</v>

767
00:42:35.451 --> 00:42:36.980
<v Speaker 1>I won't be able to state this exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

768
00:42:36.981 --> 00:42:38.720
<v Speaker 1>but it's something like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

769
00:42:38.721 --> 00:42:43.721
<v Speaker 1>a lot of what people regard as their own</v>
<v Speaker 1>personalities and and are proud of about</v>

770
00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:46.580
<v Speaker 1>their own personalities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't their own personalities at all.</v>

771
00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:51.600
<v Speaker 1>They're useless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Idiosyncrasies that defer them,</v>

772
00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:54.560
<v Speaker 1>differentiate them trivially from other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

773
00:42:54.890 --> 00:42:56.960
<v Speaker 1>but they have no value in and of </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

774
00:42:56.961 --> 00:43:01.961
<v Speaker 1>They're more like quirks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember once I was trying to teach a </v>

775
00:43:01.961 --> 00:43:05.801
<v Speaker 1>particularly stubborn student about how </v>
<v Speaker 1>to write and she had written a number of</v>

776
00:43:07.641 --> 00:43:12.641
<v Speaker 1>essays in university and got universally</v>
<v Speaker 1>walloped for them and the reason for </v>

777
00:43:13.191 --> 00:43:15.680
<v Speaker 1>that was she couldn't write really at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

778
00:43:15.681 --> 00:43:20.681
<v Speaker 1>She was really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really bad at writing and so I was </v>

779
00:43:20.681 --> 00:43:24.491
<v Speaker 1>sitting down with her trying to explain </v>
<v Speaker 1>to her what she was doing wrong and she </v>

780
00:43:26.241 --> 00:43:28.490
<v Speaker 1>was being very annoying about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very recalcitrant,</v>

781
00:43:28.491 --> 00:43:30.170
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very unwilling to listen.</v>

782
00:43:30.410 --> 00:43:32.690
<v Speaker 1>That was a pearls before swine thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

783
00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:36.770
<v Speaker 1>and at one point she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can write perfectly well,</v>

784
00:43:36.771 --> 00:43:41.771
<v Speaker 1>this university professors just don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>like my style and I could feel my hands </v>

785
00:43:41.771 --> 00:43:41.990
<v Speaker 1>creep towards her neck.</v>

786
00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:48.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that'd be funny if it wasn't true,</v>

787
00:43:48.981 --> 00:43:51.070
<v Speaker 1>but it was also true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

788
00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:52.760
<v Speaker 1>and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the Hell is with you?</v>

789
00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:57.870
<v Speaker 1>You can't even write and you think you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a style and normally do you think.</v>

790
00:44:03.970 --> 00:44:04.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

791
00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:07.570
<v Speaker 1>not knowing how to write is not a style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the other point.</v>

792
00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:08.830
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

793
00:44:08.831 --> 00:44:09.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

794
00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:13.810
<v Speaker 1>she instead of humbling herself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was necessary and okay.</v>

795
00:44:13.811 --> 00:44:18.811
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because she was a new university </v>

796
00:44:18.811 --> 00:44:18.811
<v Speaker 1>students like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course you don't know how to write.</v>

797
00:44:18.811 --> 00:44:18.811
<v Speaker 1>When were you going to learn in school?</v>

798
00:44:18.811 --> 00:44:19.430
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>

799
00:44:26.010 --> 00:44:28.230
<v Speaker 1>So she had this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

800
00:44:28.290 --> 00:44:30.510
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this style issue in it.</v>

801
00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:32.970
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just didn't go anywhere at all.</v>

802
00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:38.270
<v Speaker 1>And so now let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lost my train of thought and telling </v>

803
00:44:38.270 --> 00:44:38.310
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>telling you all those jokes,</v>

804
00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:42.780
<v Speaker 1>don't we ask in terms of above letting </v>
<v Speaker 1>things burn off.</v>

805
00:44:42.781 --> 00:44:43.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

806
00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:45.940
<v Speaker 1>so she was proud of her insufficiency </v>
<v Speaker 1>outs.</v>

807
00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:46.650
<v Speaker 1>Arrogance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

808
00:44:46.651 --> 00:44:51.651
<v Speaker 1>That's not humility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's self deception and arrogance to be </v>

809
00:44:51.651 --> 00:44:52.020
<v Speaker 1>proud of your insufficiency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a very foolish thing.</v>

810
00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:54.980
<v Speaker 1>And that means to cling to the parts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>you that are dead.</v>

811
00:44:55.320 --> 00:45:00.320
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there's this idea that runs through </v>

812
00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:00.750
<v Speaker 1>the Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think as a whole that.</v>

813
00:45:04.650 --> 00:45:09.650
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you another little side story </v>

814
00:45:09.650 --> 00:45:09.650
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was reading about socrates today and I</v>

815
00:45:09.650 --> 00:45:11.860
<v Speaker 1>was reading about socrates trial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

816
00:45:11.970 --> 00:45:15.390
<v Speaker 1>he was tried by the Athenians for </v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupting,</v>

817
00:45:15.930 --> 00:45:20.930
<v Speaker 1>for failing to worship the gods and </v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupting the youth of Athens by like </v>

818
00:45:20.930 --> 00:45:22.770
<v Speaker 1>teaching them stuff and asking them </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions,</v>

819
00:45:22.771 --> 00:45:24.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is great way to corrupt people.</v>

820
00:45:24.841 --> 00:45:29.841
<v Speaker 1>And so he knew the trial was coming and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Athens wasn't a very big place and only </v>

821
00:45:32.101 --> 00:45:33.450
<v Speaker 1>had about 25,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

822
00:45:33.451 --> 00:45:38.451
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knew everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knew who the powerful guys </v>

823
00:45:38.451 --> 00:45:38.451
<v Speaker 1>were in everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including socrates,</v>

824
00:45:38.451 --> 00:45:42.330
<v Speaker 1>knew that the trial was a warning to </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

825
00:45:42.331 --> 00:45:43.340
<v Speaker 1>get out of town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

826
00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:45.510
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to put you on trial in </v>
<v Speaker 1>six months.</v>

827
00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:49.800
<v Speaker 1>And the potential penalty is death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got that.</v>

828
00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:51.840
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

829
00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:56.900
<v Speaker 1>So socrates had a chat with his </v>
<v Speaker 1>compatriots and they were contemplating </v>

830
00:45:56.900 --> 00:46:01.821
<v Speaker 1>fair means and fall to set up a defense </v>
<v Speaker 1>for him so that he could or to leave so </v>

831
00:46:02.101 --> 00:46:04.380
<v Speaker 1>that he could not be tried and put to </v>
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>

832
00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:09.920
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he decided that he wasn't going to do </v>

833
00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:11.460
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he also decided that he wasn't going</v>

834
00:46:11.461 --> 00:46:14.940
<v Speaker 1>to even think about his defense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

835
00:46:14.941 --> 00:46:17.070
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is quite an interesting thing.</v>

836
00:46:17.610 --> 00:46:18.480
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

837
00:46:18.481 --> 00:46:23.481
<v Speaker 1>He told one of his friends that he had </v>
<v Speaker 1>this voice in his head,</v>

838
00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:27.480
<v Speaker 1>a Daemon is spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>

839
00:46:29.490 --> 00:46:34.490
<v Speaker 1>that he always listened to in that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was one of the reasons he was different </v>

840
00:46:34.490 --> 00:46:34.490
<v Speaker 1>from other people because he always </v>
<v Speaker 1>listened to this thing.</v>

841
00:46:34.590 --> 00:46:36.840
<v Speaker 1>It didn't tell him what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it told him what not to do.</v>

842
00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:40.500
<v Speaker 1>It always told them what not to do and </v>
<v Speaker 1>if it told him not to do something,</v>

843
00:46:40.501 --> 00:46:45.501
<v Speaker 1>that he didn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he was speaking and the little voice </v>

844
00:46:45.501 --> 00:46:48.771
<v Speaker 1>came up and said no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he shut up and he tried to say </v>

845
00:46:48.771 --> 00:46:50.520
<v Speaker 1>something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was very emphatic about this.</v>

846
00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:55.520
<v Speaker 1>And he said that when he tried to plan </v>
<v Speaker 1>to evade the trial or even to mount his </v>

847
00:46:56.521 --> 00:46:59.280
<v Speaker 1>own defense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the voice came up and said,</v>

848
00:46:59.790 --> 00:47:02.520
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't bother with it.</v>

849
00:47:02.610 --> 00:47:03.690
<v Speaker 1>And he thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

850
00:47:04.650 --> 00:47:09.650
<v Speaker 1>what the hell do you mean by that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a trial coming and I'm </v>

851
00:47:09.650 --> 00:47:14.001
<v Speaker 1>going to be put to death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And while he eventually concluded that </v>

852
00:47:14.001 --> 00:47:15.620
<v Speaker 1>he was an old guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

853
00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:17.790
<v Speaker 1>the next 10 years he was in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>seventies,</v>

854
00:47:17.791 --> 00:47:20.760
<v Speaker 1>perhaps the next 10 years weren't going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be that great forum.</v>

855
00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:23.940
<v Speaker 1>He got a chance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe the gods were giving them a chance</v>

856
00:47:23.941 --> 00:47:25.320
<v Speaker 1>just to bow out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

857
00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:30.400
<v Speaker 1>to put us in fares,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to say goodbye to everyone to </v>

858
00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:30.400
<v Speaker 1>avoid that last descent into</v>

859
00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:32.620
<v Speaker 2>catastrophe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which might've been particularly painful</v>

860
00:47:32.621 --> 00:47:37.621
<v Speaker 2>for a philosopher and to and to walk off</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world on his own terms,</v>

861
00:47:38.410 --> 00:47:43.410
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The point I'm making with that is that </v>

862
00:47:44.431 --> 00:47:49.431
<v Speaker 2>socrates attended to this internal voice</v>
<v Speaker 2>that at least told them what not to do </v>

863
00:47:49.431 --> 00:47:54.090
<v Speaker 2>and then he didn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course socrates was a very </v>

864
00:47:54.090 --> 00:47:56.611
<v Speaker 2>remarkable man and we still hear about </v>
<v Speaker 2>them today and we know that he existed </v>

865
00:47:56.611 --> 00:47:59.851
<v Speaker 2>and all of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so back to the back to the walking </v>

866
00:48:00.701 --> 00:48:03.790
<v Speaker 2>with God idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

867
00:48:04.270 --> 00:48:09.270
<v Speaker 2>as you elevate your aim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you create a judge at the same time,</v>

868
00:48:11.441 --> 00:48:13.630
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the new ideal,</v>

869
00:48:13.631 --> 00:48:17.110
<v Speaker 2>which is an ideal you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if it's just an ideal position that</v>

870
00:48:17.111 --> 00:48:22.111
<v Speaker 2>you might occupy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if it's still conceptualized in </v>

871
00:48:22.111 --> 00:48:24.481
<v Speaker 2>that concrete way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that becomes a judge because it's above </v>

872
00:48:24.481 --> 00:48:24.481
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

873
00:48:24.481 --> 00:48:25.930
<v Speaker 2>and then you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're terrified of it.</v>

874
00:48:25.930 --> 00:48:29.050
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's why you might be afraid </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you go start a new job,</v>

875
00:48:29.051 --> 00:48:34.051
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because this thing is above you and </v>

876
00:48:34.051 --> 00:48:34.051
<v Speaker 2>you're terrified of it and the judges </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

877
00:48:34.051 --> 00:48:38.010
<v Speaker 2>and that's useful because the judge that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're creating by formulating the ideal</v>

878
00:48:38.830 --> 00:48:43.830
<v Speaker 2>tells you what's useless about yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you can dispense with it and </v>

879
00:48:44.321 --> 00:48:49.321
<v Speaker 2>you wanted to keep doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then every time you make a judge </v>

880
00:48:49.321 --> 00:48:51.871
<v Speaker 2>that's more elevated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then there's more useless you that has </v>

881
00:48:51.871 --> 00:48:54.421
<v Speaker 2>to be dispensed with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then if you create an ultimate </v>

882
00:48:54.421 --> 00:48:58.051
<v Speaker 2>judge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what the architectural </v>

883
00:48:58.051 --> 00:48:59.080
<v Speaker 2>imagination of humankind has done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say with the figure of Christ,</v>

884
00:48:59.081 --> 00:49:04.081
<v Speaker 2>because if Christ is nothing else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he is at least the archetypical perfect </v>

885
00:49:04.081 --> 00:49:06.220
<v Speaker 2>man and therefore the judge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a judge that says,</v>

886
00:49:06.370 --> 00:49:09.670
<v Speaker 2>get rid of everything about yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>that isn't perfect.</v>

887
00:49:09.700 --> 00:49:11.110
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's also what Abraham.</v>

888
00:49:11.230 --> 00:49:13.030
<v Speaker 2>That's also what God tells Abraham,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

889
00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:14.620
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be perfect,</v>

890
00:49:14.890 --> 00:49:18.130
<v Speaker 2>to pick on ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's high enough and you can do this.</v>

891
00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:21.250
<v Speaker 2>The thing that's interesting about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think as you can do it more or less on</v>

892
00:49:21.251 --> 00:49:24.520
<v Speaker 2>your own terms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to have some collaboration from</v>

893
00:49:24.521 --> 00:49:29.521
<v Speaker 2>other people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't have to pick an external </v>

894
00:49:29.521 --> 00:49:31.951
<v Speaker 2>ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can pick an ideal that fulfills the </v>

895
00:49:31.951 --> 00:49:31.951
<v Speaker 2>role of ideal for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can say,</v>

896
00:49:31.951 --> 00:49:36.121
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well if things could be set up for me </v>

897
00:49:36.121 --> 00:49:37.630
<v Speaker 2>the way I need them to be and if I could</v>
<v Speaker 2>be who I needed to be,</v>

898
00:49:37.810 --> 00:49:41.470
<v Speaker 2>what would that look like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can figure that out for yourself</v>

899
00:49:41.471 --> 00:49:46.471
<v Speaker 2>and then instantly you have a judge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I also think that's part of the </v>

900
00:49:46.471 --> 00:49:46.471
<v Speaker 2>reason people don't do it right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't.</v>

901
00:49:46.471 --> 00:49:49.570
<v Speaker 2>Why don't people look up and move ahead </v>
<v Speaker 2>and answer is,</v>

902
00:49:49.571 --> 00:49:50.410
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

903
00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:52.210
<v Speaker 2>you start formulating an ideal.</v>

904
00:49:52.210 --> 00:49:57.210
<v Speaker 2>You formulate a judge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty easy to feel intimidated in </v>

905
00:49:57.210 --> 00:49:59.020
<v Speaker 2>the face of your own ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what happens to cane versus able,</v>

906
00:49:59.021 --> 00:50:04.021
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then it's really easy to destroy the </v>

907
00:50:04.021 --> 00:50:05.050
<v Speaker 2>ideal instead of to try to pursue it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because then you get rid of the judge,</v>

908
00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:09.040
<v Speaker 2>but it's way better lower the damn judge</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's too much.</v>

909
00:50:09.041 --> 00:50:11.410
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're current ambition is </v>
<v Speaker 2>crushing you,</v>

910
00:50:11.650 --> 00:50:16.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then maybe you're playing the tyrant to </v>

911
00:50:16.650 --> 00:50:16.650
<v Speaker 2>yourself and you should tap down your </v>
<v Speaker 2>ambitions,</v>

912
00:50:16.650 --> 00:50:18.910
<v Speaker 2>not get rid of them by any stretch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>imagination,</v>

913
00:50:18.911 --> 00:50:22.210
<v Speaker 2>but at least put the more reasonably </v>
<v Speaker 2>within your grasp.</v>

914
00:50:22.450 --> 00:50:25.660
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to leap from point one to</v>
<v Speaker 2>point 50 in one leap,</v>

915
00:50:25.661 --> 00:50:27.440
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can do it incrementally,</v>

916
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:33.010
<v Speaker 2>but I really liked this idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a profound idea that the </v>

917
00:50:33.010 --> 00:50:37.541
<v Speaker 2>process of recapitulating yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>continually is also the process of it's </v>

918
00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:39.500
<v Speaker 2>a phoenix like process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

919
00:50:39.501 --> 00:50:44.501
<v Speaker 2>You're shedding all those elements of </v>
<v Speaker 2>you that are no longer worthy of the </v>

920
00:50:44.501 --> 00:50:47.150
<v Speaker 2>pursuits that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're valuing,</v>

921
00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:52.370
<v Speaker 2>and then I would say the idea here is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that as you do that,</v>

922
00:50:52.430 --> 00:50:54.350
<v Speaker 2>you shape yourself evermore</v>

923
00:50:55.240 --> 00:51:00.240
<v Speaker 2>precisely into something that can </v>
<v Speaker 2>withstand the tragedy of life and that </v>

924
00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:03.790
<v Speaker 2>can act as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a beacon to the world.</v>

925
00:51:03.791 --> 00:51:05.170
<v Speaker 2>That's the right way of thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

926
00:51:05.171 --> 00:51:07.870
<v Speaker 2>maybe first to your friends and then to </v>
<v Speaker 2>your family.</v>

927
00:51:08.170 --> 00:51:13.170
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's a hell of a finance </v>
<v Speaker 2>ambition and there's no reason that it </v>

928
00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:13.170
<v Speaker 2>can't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

929
00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:17.821
<v Speaker 2>every one of you knows people who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>really bloody useful in a crisis and </v>

930
00:51:17.821 --> 00:51:17.920
<v Speaker 2>people that you admire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

931
00:51:17.921 --> 00:51:20.080
<v Speaker 2>Those are all you can think of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All those people,</v>

932
00:51:20.081 --> 00:51:25.081
<v Speaker 2>as you admire that you admire us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Partial incarnations of the archetypal </v>

933
00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:27.580
<v Speaker 2>Messiah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly right,</v>

934
00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:31.480
<v Speaker 2>and the more that that manifests itself </v>
<v Speaker 2>in any given person,</v>

935
00:51:31.481 --> 00:51:36.481
<v Speaker 2>then the more generally useful and </v>
<v Speaker 2>admirable that person is in a multitude </v>

936
00:51:36.481 --> 00:51:38.590
<v Speaker 2>of situations and we don't know the </v>
<v Speaker 2>limit to that,</v>

937
00:51:38.740 --> 00:51:41.440
<v Speaker 2>but people can be unbelievably good for </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

938
00:51:41.441 --> 00:51:43.960
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really something to behold.</v>

939
00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:47.830
<v Speaker 2>So that's what God tells Abraham.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

940
00:51:47.831 --> 00:51:50.770
<v Speaker 2>so the next story is about Abraham and </v>
<v Speaker 2>these angels.</v>

941
00:51:50.771 --> 00:51:55.771
<v Speaker 2>Angels show up on his doorstep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is part of the story of Sodom </v>

942
00:51:55.771 --> 00:51:56.560
<v Speaker 2>and Gomorrah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think,</v>

943
00:51:57.100 --> 00:52:02.100
<v Speaker 2>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this story's generally read as if it's </v>

944
00:52:02.100 --> 00:52:02.710
<v Speaker 2>about homosexuality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think it is here.</v>

945
00:52:02.711 --> 00:52:05.980
<v Speaker 2>I think it's about two things primarily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is</v>

946
00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:12.040
<v Speaker 2>how do you treat the strange?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the strangest,</v>

947
00:52:12.041 --> 00:52:16.270
<v Speaker 2>strange things in strange ideas and </v>
<v Speaker 2>strange people and strangers,</v>

948
00:52:16.271 --> 00:52:17.020
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all about.</v>

949
00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:22.040
<v Speaker 2>It's that which is not you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the strange lands that God </v>

950
00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:26.320
<v Speaker 2>asked Abraham to move out into how do </v>
<v Speaker 2>you interact with the strange</v>

951
00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:32.200
<v Speaker 2>and here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's one part possible rule because </v>

952
00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:32.200
<v Speaker 2>you could say to yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

953
00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:34.310
<v Speaker 2>what do I want to make friends with </v>
<v Speaker 2>more?</v>

954
00:52:34.340 --> 00:52:39.340
<v Speaker 2>Where do I want to be more comfortable?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do I want to be more comfortable with </v>

955
00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:42.671
<v Speaker 2>that which I already know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so that would be the circumscribed </v>

956
00:52:42.671 --> 00:52:46.571
<v Speaker 2>territory that you've already mastered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or do I want to be comfortable with all </v>

957
00:52:46.571 --> 00:52:50.951
<v Speaker 2>those things I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the right answer is that you </v>

958
00:52:50.951 --> 00:52:53.360
<v Speaker 2>should want to be comfortable with all </v>
<v Speaker 2>those things that you don't know because</v>

959
00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:58.010
<v Speaker 2>there is a bloody lot of things that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know and if you can be a sojourner</v>

960
00:52:58.011 --> 00:53:01.910
<v Speaker 2>among what you don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well then you're so protected because,</v>

961
00:53:02.270 --> 00:53:07.270
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to go lots of places where </v>

962
00:53:07.270 --> 00:53:07.270
<v Speaker 2>you don't know and you're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to manage it.</v>

963
00:53:07.270 --> 00:53:10.691
<v Speaker 2>So you want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to be that person that can act </v>

964
00:53:10.691 --> 00:53:13.991
<v Speaker 2>where they don't know and so well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what happens with with Abraham?</v>

965
00:53:16.970 --> 00:53:20.060
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's at home and these angels show up.</v>

966
00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:21.350
<v Speaker 2>Now</v>

967
00:53:22.740 --> 00:53:25.590
<v Speaker 2>we don't know whether they're angels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>men,</v>

968
00:53:25.591 --> 00:53:29.280
<v Speaker 2>precisely because while as this part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the story reads,</v>

969
00:53:29.281 --> 00:53:34.281
<v Speaker 2>as the Lord appeared to him in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>plains of camera and he sat in the tent </v>

970
00:53:34.281 --> 00:53:36.780
<v Speaker 2>door in the heat of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he's another visionary state by the,</v>

971
00:53:36.810 --> 00:53:39.420
<v Speaker 2>by all appearances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he lifted up his eyes and looked and</v>

972
00:53:39.421 --> 00:53:44.421
<v Speaker 2>lo three men stood by him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's real ambivalence in the story </v>

973
00:53:44.421 --> 00:53:47.871
<v Speaker 2>about the man or the three men are the </v>
<v Speaker 2>three angels are there to angels and </v>

974
00:53:47.871 --> 00:53:51.981
<v Speaker 2>God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all mixed up in this story so we </v>

975
00:53:51.981 --> 00:53:53.550
<v Speaker 2>won't clarify that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll leave it ambiguous and I think the</v>

976
00:53:53.551 --> 00:53:58.551
<v Speaker 2>ambiguity is important because you don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>know who the stranger is when you </v>

977
00:53:58.551 --> 00:54:02.331
<v Speaker 2>encounter and it depends on whether </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're thinking about it in the </v>

978
00:54:03.001 --> 00:54:06.150
<v Speaker 2>normative manner or if you're thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it in the transcendent matter.</v>

979
00:54:06.330 --> 00:54:09.390
<v Speaker 2>Because with each person that you meet </v>
<v Speaker 2>while they're just a person,</v>

980
00:54:09.450 --> 00:54:13.770
<v Speaker 2>that's one way of thinking about it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then they're the person that you know or</v>

981
00:54:13.771 --> 00:54:18.210
<v Speaker 2>they're the person as they choose to </v>
<v Speaker 2>reveal themselves to you and people keep</v>

982
00:54:18.211 --> 00:54:19.230
<v Speaker 2>themselves shielded.</v>

983
00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:23.190
<v Speaker 2>But then there also something of great </v>
<v Speaker 2>metaphysical potential,</v>

984
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:24.870
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you might say,</v>

985
00:54:24.871 --> 00:54:27.180
<v Speaker 2>well do you believe that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would say,</v>

986
00:54:27.181 --> 00:54:32.181
<v Speaker 2>well yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you believe it because you expect a lot </v>

987
00:54:32.181 --> 00:54:33.420
<v Speaker 2>from people generally speaking and are </v>
<v Speaker 2>not happy if they betray you.</v>

988
00:54:33.810 --> 00:54:38.810
<v Speaker 2>But more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our entire culture is predicated on the </v>

989
00:54:38.810 --> 00:54:40.830
<v Speaker 2>idea that each person has an indefinite </v>
<v Speaker 2>intrinsic worth.</v>

990
00:54:40.831 --> 00:54:45.831
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not talking about self esteem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about something like the </v>

991
00:54:46.100 --> 00:54:46.640
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

992
00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:50.550
<v Speaker 2>what would you say it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The implicit presupposition in our legal</v>

993
00:54:50.551 --> 00:54:54.000
<v Speaker 2>structure that no matter who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if you're a murderer,</v>

994
00:54:54.001 --> 00:54:59.001
<v Speaker 2>even if you're a condemned murderer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's something about you that's </v>

995
00:54:59.001 --> 00:55:01.890
<v Speaker 2>of transcendent value that has to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>respected by the law,</v>

996
00:55:01.891 --> 00:55:03.790
<v Speaker 2>by the law and by other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

997
00:55:03.870 --> 00:55:05.190
<v Speaker 2>And so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a remark.</v>

998
00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:06.750
<v Speaker 2>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

999
00:55:06.780 --> 00:55:11.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do I believe that the answer that is </v>

1000
00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:14.061
<v Speaker 2>well yak it out because you follow the </v>
<v Speaker 2>law and it's not an easy thing to pull </v>

1001
00:55:14.061 --> 00:55:14.061
<v Speaker 2>out of the law.</v>

1002
00:55:14.061 --> 00:55:18.320
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of the idea that you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>intrinsic natural rights and you don't </v>

1003
00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:22.311
<v Speaker 2>pull that out of our law man without </v>
<v Speaker 2>having the whole thing fall down and I </v>

1004
00:55:22.311 --> 00:55:26.241
<v Speaker 2>think the whole idea that you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>intrinsic natural rights is predicated </v>

1005
00:55:26.241 --> 00:55:29.481
<v Speaker 2>on something like the biblical </v>
<v Speaker 2>hypothesis that human beings have,</v>

1006
00:55:30.061 --> 00:55:35.061
<v Speaker 2>a logos nature and that we are involved </v>
<v Speaker 2>in this speaking forth of being and as </v>

1007
00:55:36.750 --> 00:55:40.170
<v Speaker 2>beings who are who are involved in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking forth of being.</v>

1008
00:55:40.740 --> 00:55:44.370
<v Speaker 2>There's something about us that has to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be respected by,</v>

1009
00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:46.980
<v Speaker 2>by ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in relationship to ourselves,</v>

1010
00:55:47.250 --> 00:55:49.050
<v Speaker 2>by ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in relationship to other people,</v>

1011
00:55:49.051 --> 00:55:53.970
<v Speaker 2>but even more strangely by ourselves in </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship to even to criminals,</v>

1012
00:55:53.971 --> 00:55:58.971
<v Speaker 2>even to vicious criminals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't remove that transcendent </v>

1013
00:55:58.971 --> 00:56:00.750
<v Speaker 2>element and that's that to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's also a mirror,</v>

1014
00:56:00.751 --> 00:56:04.560
<v Speaker 2>a miracle of conceptualization because </v>
<v Speaker 2>who the hell is going to think that up?</v>

1015
00:56:04.620 --> 00:56:08.460
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even the most vicious of murderers has a</v>

1016
00:56:08.461 --> 00:56:11.250
<v Speaker 2>touch of the transcendent that needs to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be respected.</v>

1017
00:56:11.460 --> 00:56:15.630
<v Speaker 2>Of all the ideas that are unlikely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's got a top the list,</v>

1018
00:56:15.631 --> 00:56:19.110
<v Speaker 2>and of course without that you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a very barbaric legal system,</v>

1019
00:56:19.111 --> 00:56:24.111
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because no one is protected as soon as </v>

1020
00:56:24.111 --> 00:56:24.111
<v Speaker 2>you make a mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're in the.</v>

1021
00:56:24.111 --> 00:56:26.740
<v Speaker 2>Then you have no rights whatsoever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that isn't what happens in the West,</v>

1022
00:56:26.741 --> 00:56:29.710
<v Speaker 2>which is an absolutely amazing thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

1023
00:56:30.940 --> 00:56:35.170
<v Speaker 2>Abraham is a master of the stranger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one way of thinking about it.</v>

1024
00:56:37.150 --> 00:56:42.150
<v Speaker 2>He knows what to do when strangers come </v>
<v Speaker 2>along and he opens his.</v>

1025
00:56:42.790 --> 00:56:46.060
<v Speaker 2>He opens himself up to them and I would </v>
<v Speaker 2>say he does that.</v>

1026
00:56:46.090 --> 00:56:48.430
<v Speaker 2>We know he's not a naive guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Abraham,</v>

1027
00:56:48.431 --> 00:56:49.780
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's no weakling.</v>

1028
00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:54.910
<v Speaker 2>A couple of stories ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he took a big army and went and harassed</v>

1029
00:56:54.911 --> 00:56:57.460
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of kings and took his nephew </v>
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>

1030
00:56:57.461 --> 00:56:59.230
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a tough guy.</v>

1031
00:56:59.940 --> 00:57:02.620
<v Speaker 2>And so if stranger show up and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>welcomes them,</v>

1032
00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:05.890
<v Speaker 2>it's not because he couldn't do </v>
<v Speaker 2>otherwise.</v>

1033
00:57:06.190 --> 00:57:11.190
<v Speaker 2>He could certainly do otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's not because he isn't aware of </v>

1034
00:57:11.190 --> 00:57:14.670
<v Speaker 2>what people can be like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's perfectly aware of what people can </v>

1035
00:57:14.670 --> 00:57:17.371
<v Speaker 2>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he determines to take a particular </v>

1036
00:57:17.371 --> 00:57:17.560
<v Speaker 2>attitude towards them and that is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>welcome them.</v>

1037
00:57:18.430 --> 00:57:19.960
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and why would you do that?</v>

1038
00:57:19.961 --> 00:57:24.961
<v Speaker 2>And I think the answer to that is you </v>
<v Speaker 2>hold out your hand in trust to someone </v>

1039
00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:31.510
<v Speaker 2>and you evoke the best from them if </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's there to be given.</v>

1040
00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:34.750
<v Speaker 2>So it's an act of courage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's.</v>

1041
00:57:34.810 --> 00:57:37.030
<v Speaker 2>It isn't me meeting you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly,</v>

1042
00:57:37.300 --> 00:57:42.300
<v Speaker 2>not exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more like the transcendent part of </v>

1043
00:57:42.300 --> 00:57:45.091
<v Speaker 2>me making a gesture that allows the </v>
<v Speaker 2>transcendent part of you to step </v>

1044
00:57:45.091 --> 00:57:46.870
<v Speaker 2>forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that happens all the time.</v>

1045
00:57:47.140 --> 00:57:50.020
<v Speaker 2>It happens all the time in normative </v>
<v Speaker 2>discourse.</v>

1046
00:57:50.021 --> 00:57:55.021
<v Speaker 2>You know this perfectly well because </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you can have a real casual </v>

1047
00:57:55.021 --> 00:57:55.390
<v Speaker 2>conversation with someone that just goes</v>
<v Speaker 2>nowhere,</v>

1048
00:57:55.391 --> 00:57:55.630
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1049
00:57:55.630 --> 00:58:00.630
<v Speaker 2>It's just shallow as can be or now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you can actually make contact </v>

1050
00:58:00.630 --> 00:58:00.820
<v Speaker 2>with someone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1051
00:58:00.821 --> 00:58:03.610
<v Speaker 2>And you're both,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say enlightened down ennobled by</v>

1052
00:58:03.611 --> 00:58:08.611
<v Speaker 2>the conversation and that's a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We would call that a deep conversation </v>

1053
00:58:08.611 --> 00:58:10.990
<v Speaker 2>for for some reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we made a deep connection.</v>

1054
00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:13.720
<v Speaker 2>Whatever that means,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it means well,</v>

1055
00:58:13.721 --> 00:58:15.370
<v Speaker 2>it certainly means that it's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>shallow.</v>

1056
00:58:15.570 --> 00:58:17.620
<v Speaker 2>We were not sure about what these </v>
<v Speaker 2>metaphor means,</v>

1057
00:58:17.621 --> 00:58:19.990
<v Speaker 2>but it means that it reaches deep inside</v>
<v Speaker 2>of you.</v>

1058
00:58:19.991 --> 00:58:23.320
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You make direct person to person contact</v>

1059
00:58:23.560 --> 00:58:28.560
<v Speaker 2>and those sorts of conversations are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm replenishing that that's the right </v>

1060
00:58:29.501 --> 00:58:34.501
<v Speaker 2>way to think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They genuinely are and I think that's </v>

1061
00:58:34.501 --> 00:58:37.381
<v Speaker 2>because they provide you with that bread</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not material bread and that's the</v>

1062
00:58:38.441 --> 00:58:43.441
<v Speaker 2>information that you need to to thrive </v>
<v Speaker 2>and to put yourself together and so it </v>

1063
00:58:44.411 --> 00:58:49.411
<v Speaker 2>does matter how you meet someone and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't matter how you treat them when </v>

1064
00:58:49.411 --> 00:58:49.600
<v Speaker 2>you first meet them and it's amazing.</v>

1065
00:58:49.870 --> 00:58:51.940
<v Speaker 2>I've learned to do this at least in </v>
<v Speaker 2>part,</v>

1066
00:58:52.090 --> 00:58:53.890
<v Speaker 2>partly because I'm a clinical </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologist.</v>

1067
00:58:53.891 --> 00:58:58.891
<v Speaker 2>I've learned how to talk to people very </v>
<v Speaker 2>rapidly and I have the most amazing </v>

1068
00:58:58.891 --> 00:59:02.161
<v Speaker 2>adventures with people in cabs and when </v>
<v Speaker 2>I travel because all talked to them </v>

1069
00:59:02.161 --> 00:59:06.181
<v Speaker 2>directly right away and they'll tell me </v>
<v Speaker 2>the wildest stories and show me the </v>

1070
00:59:06.181 --> 00:59:09.691
<v Speaker 2>craziest things because I'm actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>interested in what they have to say and </v>

1071
00:59:09.691 --> 00:59:10.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm not afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1072
00:59:10.331 --> 00:59:12.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm somewhat afraid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not.</v>

1073
00:59:12.730 --> 00:59:17.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sufficiently afraid to have that</v>
<v Speaker 2>stopped me and I'm acting on the </v>

1074
00:59:17.730 --> 00:59:21.421
<v Speaker 2>presupposition that the person has </v>
<v Speaker 2>something of great interest to reveal </v>

1075
00:59:22.580 --> 00:59:24.470
<v Speaker 2>and that's a very useful thing to know </v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

1076
00:59:24.471 --> 00:59:29.471
<v Speaker 2>Because one of the things that's really </v>
<v Speaker 2>cool about people that know you really </v>

1077
00:59:29.471 --> 00:59:30.320
<v Speaker 2>learn this as a clinical psychologist is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that if you can get people talking,</v>

1078
00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:33.110
<v Speaker 2>they're so damn interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can hardly stand it.</v>

1079
00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:38.670
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they have these idiosyncratic </v>

1080
00:59:38.670 --> 00:59:40.931
<v Speaker 2>experiences that are only there is right</v>
<v Speaker 2>there only there's personally no one </v>

1081
00:59:40.931 --> 00:59:44.411
<v Speaker 2>else could tell the story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's the kind of stories that you </v>

1082
00:59:44.411 --> 00:59:44.411
<v Speaker 2>want to hear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when they tell you those stories,</v>

1083
00:59:44.411 --> 00:59:48.941
<v Speaker 2>you learn something you didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what that means is that you can </v>

1084
00:59:48.941 --> 00:59:52.271
<v Speaker 2>treat the landscape of strangers as an </v>
<v Speaker 2>endless vista of places to learn things </v>

1085
00:59:52.671 --> 00:59:57.671
<v Speaker 2>you didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you know enough so that you're </v>

1086
00:59:57.671 --> 01:00:00.260
<v Speaker 2>satisfied with your life and everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>has ceased to be a tragedy around you.</v>

1087
01:00:00.261 --> 01:00:04.460
<v Speaker 2>Well then you can be comfortable in your</v>
<v Speaker 2>circumscribed domain of,</v>

1088
01:00:05.090 --> 01:00:07.190
<v Speaker 2>of totalitarian knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>

1089
01:00:07.430 --> 01:00:12.430
<v Speaker 2>But if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if your life is insufficient and you're </v>

1090
01:00:12.430 --> 01:00:13.610
<v Speaker 2>suffering more than you want to and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything isn't what it should be,</v>

1091
01:00:13.611 --> 01:00:17.180
<v Speaker 2>then you need to look where you haven't </v>
<v Speaker 2>looked for what you don't have,</v>

1092
01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:19.790
<v Speaker 2>and then you can look outside beyond </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1093
01:00:19.790 --> 01:00:22.490
<v Speaker 2>And then you can make friends with what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't understand,</v>

1094
01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:27.760
<v Speaker 2>and that's a huge part of what this </v>
<v Speaker 2>story's about because what happens is </v>

1095
01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:32.471
<v Speaker 2>that Abraham welcomes the men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God angels and treats them very well and</v>

1096
01:00:33.610 --> 01:00:36.110
<v Speaker 2>reaps a tremendous benefit as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequence.</v>

1097
01:00:36.111 --> 01:00:41.111
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well then the story reverses and we end </v>

1098
01:00:41.111 --> 01:00:44.571
<v Speaker 2>up in Sodom and Gomorrah were the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>angels sojourn and they're treated </v>

1099
01:00:44.571 --> 01:00:47.630
<v Speaker 2>terribly and all hell breaks loose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's what the story's about.</v>

1100
01:00:47.631 --> 01:00:49.780
<v Speaker 2>It's fundamental.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now there's A.</v>

1101
01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:53.930
<v Speaker 2>There's a sexual impropriety thing going</v>
<v Speaker 2>on that I'm also going to delve into,</v>

1102
01:00:53.931 --> 01:00:56.510
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think that's the critical </v>
<v Speaker 2>issue in the story.</v>

1103
01:00:56.511 --> 01:01:01.511
<v Speaker 2>The critical issue in this story is how </v>
<v Speaker 2>do you act in the face of the stranger?</v>

1104
01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:04.970
<v Speaker 2>You know there's a statement in the New </v>
<v Speaker 2>Testament,</v>

1105
01:01:04.971 --> 01:01:07.850
<v Speaker 2>Christ says something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

1106
01:01:08.450 --> 01:01:10.850
<v Speaker 2>when you do something to the least of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

1107
01:01:10.851 --> 01:01:14.920
<v Speaker 2>you do it to me him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1108
01:01:15.650 --> 01:01:19.960
<v Speaker 2>And that's a very difficult statement to</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand too,</v>

1109
01:01:19.961 --> 01:01:24.961
<v Speaker 2>but it's something like it's something </v>
<v Speaker 2>reminiscent of the requirement to keep </v>

1110
01:01:27.281 --> 01:01:30.460
<v Speaker 2>the idea of the transcendent reality of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the person in mind.</v>

1111
01:01:30.461 --> 01:01:35.461
<v Speaker 2>At the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you keep their proximal reality in mind </v>

1112
01:01:35.461 --> 01:01:38.610
<v Speaker 2>to have to have your mind in two places </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the same time when you're talking to </v>

1113
01:01:38.621 --> 01:01:39.100
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

1114
01:01:42.860 --> 01:01:47.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I learned from a friend of mine in </v>

1115
01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:49.991
<v Speaker 2>Montreal who's very socially </v>
<v Speaker 2>sophisticated in some ways.</v>

1116
01:01:51.470 --> 01:01:53.200
<v Speaker 2>Whenever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when whenever he went into a store,</v>

1117
01:01:53.201 --> 01:01:58.070
<v Speaker 2>I always like going shopping with him </v>
<v Speaker 2>and whenever he went into a store and he</v>

1118
01:01:58.071 --> 01:02:00.890
<v Speaker 2>talked and he had an interaction with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>clerk,</v>

1119
01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:03.740
<v Speaker 2>the first thing he would do is have an </v>
<v Speaker 2>interaction with the clerk.</v>

1120
01:02:03.741 --> 01:02:04.090
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1121
01:02:04.091 --> 01:02:06.920
<v Speaker 2>he wouldn't have any interaction with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the role of the clerk.</v>

1122
01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:10.400
<v Speaker 2>He'd like look at the person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of take stock of the fact that they</v>

1123
01:02:10.401 --> 01:02:15.401
<v Speaker 2>were there and then ask them something </v>
<v Speaker 2>genuine about their job or their store,</v>

1124
01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:20.250
<v Speaker 2>how they were doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like go into a conversation away and</v>

1125
01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:23.220
<v Speaker 1>he didn't get personal about it because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that can be intrusive,</v>

1126
01:02:23.221 --> 01:02:28.221
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be very sophisticated to do </v>

1127
01:02:28.221 --> 01:02:29.901
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he did indicate to the person that </v>

1128
01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:34.130
<v Speaker 1>he was there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in part for the good that could</v>

1129
01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:36.530
<v Speaker 1>be done between them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>

1130
01:02:36.770 --> 01:02:39.800
<v Speaker 1>And then the person would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculously helpful,</v>

1131
01:02:40.190 --> 01:02:41.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1132
01:02:43.970 --> 01:02:45.780
<v Speaker 1>and so then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if people mistreat you,</v>

1133
01:02:45.781 --> 01:02:50.330
<v Speaker 1>you see this with anti social kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very tragic thing to see because if</v>

1134
01:02:50.331 --> 01:02:52.970
<v Speaker 1>you're an antisocial child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the time you were about four,</v>

1135
01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:55.460
<v Speaker 1>you're very hostile and distrustful to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1136
01:02:55.700 --> 01:02:59.510
<v Speaker 1>And so you'd like a growling puppy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're a growling puppy,</v>

1137
01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:02.360
<v Speaker 1>tend not to get petted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're more likely to get kicked.</v>

1138
01:03:02.690 --> 01:03:04.720
<v Speaker 1>And if you're growling puppy and you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>kicked,</v>

1139
01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:09.740
<v Speaker 1>then you have even more reason to grow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's sort of the story of </v>

1140
01:03:09.740 --> 01:03:13.241
<v Speaker 1>antisocial kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they're not well socialized by the </v>

1141
01:03:13.241 --> 01:03:16.391
<v Speaker 1>time they're four and they're more on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the aggressive side than they alienate </v>

1142
01:03:16.391 --> 01:03:20.381
<v Speaker 1>themselves from the community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all they get is rejection while and </v>

1143
01:03:20.381 --> 01:03:21.290
<v Speaker 1>then they look at the rejection and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

1144
01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:22.730
<v Speaker 1>well</v>

1145
01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:25.460
<v Speaker 1>hell with humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1146
01:03:25.670 --> 01:03:27.260
<v Speaker 1>and no wonder they think that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1147
01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:32.510
<v Speaker 1>but the part of the catastrophe is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they get what they evoke.</v>

1148
01:03:32.790 --> 01:03:37.790
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not saying it's their fault </v>

1149
01:03:37.790 --> 01:03:37.790
<v Speaker 1>precisely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't matter.</v>

1150
01:03:37.790 --> 01:03:38.840
<v Speaker 1>That's still what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you might ask yourself,</v>

1151
01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:42.020
<v Speaker 1>if you're not getting from people what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you need,</v>

1152
01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:45.590
<v Speaker 1>there is some possibility that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not approaching,</v>

1153
01:03:45.650 --> 01:03:48.290
<v Speaker 1>especially if this happens to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>repeatedly across people.</v>

1154
01:03:48.470 --> 01:03:53.470
<v Speaker 1>And this is a virtual certainty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it happens to you repeatedly across </v>

1155
01:03:53.470 --> 01:03:56.861
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you have the same bad </v>

1156
01:03:56.861 --> 01:03:56.861
<v Speaker 1>experience with people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not them,</v>

1157
01:03:56.861 --> 01:03:59.480
<v Speaker 1>it's you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say three is the limit.</v>

1158
01:04:00.020 --> 01:04:01.700
<v Speaker 1>If something happens to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once</v>

1159
01:04:03.450 --> 01:04:05.550
<v Speaker 1>you write it off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it happens to you twice,</v>

1160
01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:08.610
<v Speaker 1>it's like you open your eyes but you </v>
<v Speaker 1>write it off.</v>

1161
01:04:08.790 --> 01:04:12.450
<v Speaker 1>But if it harms tier three times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably you.</v>

1162
01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:18.920
<v Speaker 1>Or is the rest of the world better?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's you because you're not going to </v>

1163
01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:22.350
<v Speaker 1>change the rest of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he lifted up his eyes and looked.</v>

1164
01:04:22.351 --> 01:04:24.510
<v Speaker 1>And Lo three men stood by him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when he saw them,</v>

1165
01:04:24.511 --> 01:04:29.511
<v Speaker 1>he ran to meet them from the tent door </v>
<v Speaker 1>and bowed himself to the ground and </v>

1166
01:04:29.511 --> 01:04:29.511
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my Lord,</v>

1167
01:04:29.850 --> 01:04:31.980
<v Speaker 1>if now I have found favor in thy sight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pass,</v>

1168
01:04:31.981 --> 01:04:33.630
<v Speaker 1>not away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I pray thee from Thy Servant.</v>

1169
01:04:33.631 --> 01:04:38.631
<v Speaker 1>Let a little water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Pray You be fetched and wash your </v>

1170
01:04:38.631 --> 01:04:38.631
<v Speaker 1>feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wash your feet.</v>

1171
01:04:38.631 --> 01:04:42.890
<v Speaker 1>Take the dust from your feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extract yourself out from your journey,</v>

1172
01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:46.670
<v Speaker 1>right and sit.</v>

1173
01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:54.560
<v Speaker 1>I'll fetch a morsel of bread and comfort</v>
<v Speaker 1>ye your hearts after that you can pass </v>

1174
01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:58.090
<v Speaker 1>on for therefore are you come to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>servant and they said so do as thou hast</v>

1175
01:04:58.100 --> 01:05:00.200
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Abraham hastened into the tent,</v>

1176
01:05:00.650 --> 01:05:03.110
<v Speaker 1>into the tent under Sarah and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make ready quickly.</v>

1177
01:05:03.111 --> 01:05:06.350
<v Speaker 1>Three measures of fine meal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knead it and make cakes upon the earth.</v>

1178
01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:11.800
<v Speaker 1>Powerful call to hospitality here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Abraham ran onto the herd and </v>

1179
01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:15.350
<v Speaker 1>fetched a calf tender and good and gave </v>
<v Speaker 1>it to a young man and he hasted to dress</v>

1180
01:05:15.351 --> 01:05:20.351
<v Speaker 1>it and he took butter and milk and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>calf which he had dressed and set it </v>

1181
01:05:20.351 --> 01:05:23.731
<v Speaker 1>before them and he stood by them under </v>
<v Speaker 1>the tree and they did eat some </v>

1182
01:05:25.021 --> 01:05:27.420
<v Speaker 1>commentary from here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hebrews 13,</v>

1183
01:05:27.421 --> 01:05:32.421
<v Speaker 1>to be not forgetful to entertain </v>
<v Speaker 1>strangers for thereby some have </v>

1184
01:05:32.550 --> 01:05:37.550
<v Speaker 1>entertained angels unawares.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a commentary from Matthew Henry,</v>

1185
01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:40.170
<v Speaker 1>who is a nonconformist minister and </v>
<v Speaker 1>author,</v>

1186
01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:43.830
<v Speaker 1>cheerful and obliging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Manners in showing kindness are great.</v>

1187
01:05:43.831 --> 01:05:46.920
<v Speaker 1>Ornaments to piety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are condescending,</v>

1188
01:05:46.921 --> 01:05:48.360
<v Speaker 1>Lord Vouch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>safest,</v>

1189
01:05:48.420 --> 01:05:53.360
<v Speaker 1>not personal visits to us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet still by his spirit,</v>

1190
01:05:53.361 --> 01:05:55.880
<v Speaker 1>he stands at the door and knocks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we're inclined to open,</v>

1191
01:05:55.881 --> 01:05:58.610
<v Speaker 1>he deigns to enter by his gracious </v>
<v Speaker 1>constellations.</v>

1192
01:05:58.611 --> 01:06:01.610
<v Speaker 1>He provides a rich feast of which we </v>
<v Speaker 1>partake with him.</v>

1193
01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:06.710
<v Speaker 1>This is from revelations 3:20.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Behold,</v>

1194
01:06:06.711 --> 01:06:11.711
<v Speaker 1>I stand at the door and knock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If any man hear my voice and open the </v>

1195
01:06:11.711 --> 01:06:15.041
<v Speaker 1>door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will come into him and will sup with </v>

1196
01:06:15.041 --> 01:06:15.041
<v Speaker 1>him and he with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1197
01:06:15.450 --> 01:06:19.070
<v Speaker 1>the hyperlink nature of those quotes is </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite obvious.</v>

1198
01:06:19.071 --> 01:06:22.160
<v Speaker 1>There's 10 or 15 things being said at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same time,</v>

1199
01:06:22.161 --> 01:06:27.161
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is a reference to the idea that if </v>

1200
01:06:27.161 --> 01:06:27.161
<v Speaker 1>you ask for something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will be given to you.</v>

1201
01:06:27.161 --> 01:06:28.550
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a very strange idea,</v>

1202
01:06:28.551 --> 01:06:31.960
<v Speaker 1>but I like that idea a lot and I believe</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

1203
01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:34.160
<v Speaker 1>in my experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has been true.</v>

1204
01:06:34.550 --> 01:06:39.550
<v Speaker 1>If it was that I wanted what I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>asking for because that's the real </v>

1205
01:06:39.550 --> 01:06:39.550
<v Speaker 1>issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1206
01:06:39.550 --> 01:06:42.080
<v Speaker 1>Because the question is if you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

1207
01:06:42.290 --> 01:06:47.290
<v Speaker 1>what does it mean to want it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what it means is to sacrifice </v>

1208
01:06:47.290 --> 01:06:50.480
<v Speaker 1>whatever is necessary to get it because </v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise you don't want it.</v>

1209
01:06:51.260 --> 01:06:56.260
<v Speaker 1>And so there's an equation here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not claiming it's ultimate </v>

1210
01:06:56.260 --> 01:07:00.341
<v Speaker 1>accuracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the equation is something like you </v>

1211
01:07:00.341 --> 01:07:01.430
<v Speaker 1>don't want it unless you're willing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice for it.</v>

1212
01:07:02.210 --> 01:07:07.210
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't want it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to get it because </v>

1213
01:07:07.210 --> 01:07:09.911
<v Speaker 1>you're scattered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you do want at any make the </v>

1214
01:07:09.911 --> 01:07:10.190
<v Speaker 1>proper sacrifices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then</v>

1215
01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:15.450
<v Speaker 1>God only knows what might happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a c.</v>

1216
01:07:15.451 --> 01:07:20.451
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I really like about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the existential philosophers is their </v>

1217
01:07:20.791 --> 01:07:25.791
<v Speaker 1>emphasis on personal responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many of them had an emphasis on the role</v>

1218
01:07:26.551 --> 01:07:29.550
<v Speaker 1>that people had in shaping their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>destiny.</v>

1219
01:07:29.730 --> 01:07:34.730
<v Speaker 1>The exits for the existentialists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think this was a consequence of </v>

1220
01:07:34.730 --> 01:07:35.190
<v Speaker 1>the religious substructure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1221
01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:39.930
<v Speaker 1>of philosophical thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was self evident that life was tragic</v>

1222
01:07:39.990 --> 01:07:42.240
<v Speaker 1>and bitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1223
01:07:42.410 --> 01:07:44.880
<v Speaker 1>and then fair enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that isn't where it ended.</v>

1224
01:07:44.910 --> 01:07:47.190
<v Speaker 1>The next issue was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1225
01:07:47.191 --> 01:07:52.191
<v Speaker 1>there are better in ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>better and worse ways of dealing with </v>

1226
01:07:52.191 --> 01:07:55.101
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the better way of dealing with the </v>

1227
01:07:55.101 --> 01:07:57.110
<v Speaker 1>fact that life is tragic and better is </v>
<v Speaker 1>to pause it,</v>

1228
01:07:57.560 --> 01:08:01.940
<v Speaker 1>the self you could be and live </v>
<v Speaker 1>authentically in relationship to that.</v>

1229
01:08:02.330 --> 01:08:06.110
<v Speaker 1>And then the next issue and some this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>something kierkegaard talked about,</v>

1230
01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:09.680
<v Speaker 1>particularly when he talked about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessity of being a knight of faith,</v>

1231
01:08:09.681 --> 01:08:14.681
<v Speaker 1>is that the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is I think part of the light </v>

1232
01:08:14.681 --> 01:08:16.580
<v Speaker 1>part of life that's the intractable </v>
<v Speaker 1>adventure.</v>

1233
01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:19.400
<v Speaker 2>No one can take the adventure of life </v>
<v Speaker 2>away from you,</v>

1234
01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:22.940
<v Speaker 2>that they can't do it with good advice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1235
01:08:23.210 --> 01:08:28.210
<v Speaker 2>because no one can demonstrate to you </v>
<v Speaker 2>that if you straighten yourself out a </v>

1236
01:08:28.210 --> 01:08:32.421
<v Speaker 2>name at what you want and make the </v>
<v Speaker 2>proper sacrifices that your life will </v>

1237
01:08:32.421 --> 01:08:33.920
<v Speaker 2>turn out in the manner that you might </v>
<v Speaker 2>want it to turn out.</v>

1238
01:08:34.370 --> 01:08:38.120
<v Speaker 2>It isn't in anyone else's purview to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make that judgment.</v>

1239
01:08:38.121 --> 01:08:42.110
<v Speaker 2>The only person that can possibly figure</v>
<v Speaker 2>that out is you.</v>

1240
01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:44.480
<v Speaker 2>It's something that can't be stolen from</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1241
01:08:44.481 --> 01:08:49.481
<v Speaker 2>I would say it's your destiny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a destiny that cannot be stolen </v>

1242
01:08:49.481 --> 01:08:50.540
<v Speaker 2>from you and you can forgo it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can say,</v>

1243
01:08:50.541 --> 01:08:55.541
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not willing to put in the effort </v>

1244
01:08:55.541 --> 01:08:55.541
<v Speaker 2>because what if I fail?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1245
01:08:55.541 --> 01:08:55.820
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't put in the effort,</v>

1246
01:08:55.880 --> 01:09:00.880
<v Speaker 2>you will fail because life is hard and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it takes everything out of you to do it </v>

1247
01:09:02.271 --> 01:09:07.271
<v Speaker 2>properly so you will fail and if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>make the proper sacrifices,</v>

1248
01:09:07.881 --> 01:09:08.720
<v Speaker 2>you might fail.</v>

1249
01:09:08.750 --> 01:09:13.750
<v Speaker 2>That's why I like the ambiguity and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>story of Cain and Abel because we're </v>

1250
01:09:13.750 --> 01:09:15.020
<v Speaker 2>never really told why God rejected </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kane's offerings.</v>

1251
01:09:15.170 --> 01:09:18.290
<v Speaker 2>There's hands that came maybe isn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing as good a job as he should,</v>

1252
01:09:18.440 --> 01:09:22.250
<v Speaker 2>and he certainly gets bitter about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's no smoking pistol.</v>

1253
01:09:22.310 --> 01:09:23.030
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1254
01:09:23.031 --> 01:09:25.560
<v Speaker 2>Cain is a bad guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He made terrible sacrifices,</v>

1255
01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:27.830
<v Speaker 2>so god rejected him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You never know.</v>

1256
01:09:27.950 --> 01:09:32.950
<v Speaker 2>Cain might've been working pretty damn </v>
<v Speaker 2>hard and things still didn't work out </v>

1257
01:09:32.950 --> 01:09:35.981
<v Speaker 2>for them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that ambiguity is </v>

1258
01:09:35.981 --> 01:09:37.250
<v Speaker 2>appropriate in the story because that </v>
<v Speaker 2>ambiguity ambiguity is in life.</v>

1259
01:09:37.570 --> 01:09:42.570
<v Speaker 2>You'd be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd be a fool to say that everything </v>

1260
01:09:42.570 --> 01:09:43.670
<v Speaker 2>always works out for everyone if they </v>
<v Speaker 2>just do things right.</v>

1261
01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a very.</v>

1262
01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:50.240
<v Speaker 2>That's a very careless thing to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>given how much tragedy and catastrophe </v>

1263
01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:51.980
<v Speaker 2>there is in the world and how much of it</v>
<v Speaker 2>seems to be undeserved,</v>

1264
01:09:52.190 --> 01:09:55.160
<v Speaker 2>but that still has very little bearing I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think on,</v>

1265
01:09:55.810 --> 01:09:58.790
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on your own individual adventure and the</v>

1266
01:09:58.791 --> 01:10:03.791
<v Speaker 2>necessity for the necessity for opening </v>
<v Speaker 2>the door to who you could be and,</v>

1267
01:10:11.730 --> 01:10:14.190
<v Speaker 2>and the necessity to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seriously.</v>

1268
01:10:14.430 --> 01:10:19.430
<v Speaker 2>And I do believe and I think I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's why this most impossible </v>

1269
01:10:19.430 --> 01:10:21.180
<v Speaker 2>of versus you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knock and the door will open.</v>

1270
01:10:21.540 --> 01:10:26.540
<v Speaker 2>Why that's believable is that I have </v>
<v Speaker 2>never met anyone who couldn't</v>

1271
01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:33.700
<v Speaker 2>hypothesize a better them in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>manner.</v>

1272
01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:36.520
<v Speaker 2>All they had to do is ask.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1273
01:10:36.550 --> 01:10:37.570
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how could you be better?</v>

1274
01:10:37.750 --> 01:10:39.390
<v Speaker 2>Thank well here's three ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1275
01:10:39.660 --> 01:10:40.570
<v Speaker 2>it's no problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1276
01:10:40.571 --> 01:10:43.270
<v Speaker 2>You can think about that no time flat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's small ways,</v>

1277
01:10:43.540 --> 01:10:48.540
<v Speaker 2>but you can almost always at least think</v>
<v Speaker 2>of something stupid that you're doing </v>

1278
01:10:48.540 --> 01:10:51.310
<v Speaker 2>that you could quit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that means that you do have this.</v>

1279
01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:56.360
<v Speaker 2>It's a strange thing in people that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have this built in capacity to pause it </v>

1280
01:10:56.360 --> 01:11:00.301
<v Speaker 2>a higher self and then to move towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and maybe maybe that's part of where </v>

1281
01:11:00.301 --> 01:11:04.891
<v Speaker 2>the religious instinct really came from </v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking like really reductionistically </v>

1282
01:11:04.891 --> 01:11:07.240
<v Speaker 2>like as a materialist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As an evolutionary psychologist,</v>

1283
01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:10.210
<v Speaker 2>we have this notion of the transcendent </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideal,</v>

1284
01:11:10.211 --> 01:11:15.211
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That that seems to be pervasive across </v>

1285
01:11:15.211 --> 01:11:15.211
<v Speaker 2>cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1286
01:11:15.211 --> 01:11:18.170
<v Speaker 2>that's the ultimate manifestation of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>human proclivity to be able to pause it </v>

1287
01:11:18.170 --> 01:11:19.500
<v Speaker 2>an ideal at all and to move forward.</v>

1288
01:11:19.530 --> 01:11:20.550
<v Speaker 2>You pause it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>An ideal,</v>

1289
01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:23.040
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That you need that to move forward.</v>

1290
01:11:23.250 --> 01:11:24.090
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can pause it,</v>

1291
01:11:24.110 --> 01:11:25.920
<v Speaker 2>an ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why can't you pause it?</v>

1292
01:11:25.980 --> 01:11:27.510
<v Speaker 2>The ultimate ideal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1293
01:11:27.511 --> 01:11:32.511
<v Speaker 2>if you can then instantly you've got a </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious sensibility instantly and so </v>

1294
01:11:32.511 --> 01:11:35.040
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's because I'm positive like </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a biologist,</v>

1295
01:11:35.041 --> 01:11:39.120
<v Speaker 2>what the hell is the basis of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious instinct because the idea that</v>

1296
01:11:39.121 --> 01:11:42.300
<v Speaker 2>it's mere superstition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we can just dispense with that.</v>

1297
01:11:42.450 --> 01:11:44.790
<v Speaker 2>That's a wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a human universal.</v>

1298
01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:47.430
<v Speaker 2>You can evoke religious experiences all </v>
<v Speaker 2>sorts of ways,</v>

1299
01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:52.760
<v Speaker 2>so we're not going to play that game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some reason that that instinct </v>

1300
01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:56.481
<v Speaker 2>exists and the first thing to do with it</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to try to reduce it to something </v>

1301
01:11:56.481 --> 01:11:59.580
<v Speaker 2>that's biological and leave it at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not to mess with the metaphysics,</v>

1302
01:11:59.850 --> 01:12:04.850
<v Speaker 2>but it certainly could be the case that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the ultimate extension of our </v>

1303
01:12:04.850 --> 01:12:06.390
<v Speaker 2>capacity to pause it and ideal and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>also might say,</v>

1304
01:12:06.391 --> 01:12:07.740
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's good enough because,</v>

1305
01:12:09.380 --> 01:12:11.000
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ideal moves you forward.</v>

1306
01:12:11.001 --> 01:12:16.001
<v Speaker 2>It fills your life with meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no doubt about that because it </v>

1307
01:12:16.001 --> 01:12:17.360
<v Speaker 2>is in the movement towards your ideal </v>
<v Speaker 2>that life's meaning is to be attained.</v>

1308
01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:19.640
<v Speaker 2>And then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1309
01:12:19.641 --> 01:12:23.240
<v Speaker 2>how much meaning is there in moving </v>
<v Speaker 2>forward towards an ultimate ideal?</v>

1310
01:12:23.241 --> 01:12:25.460
<v Speaker 2>Well more meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though it's more difficult,</v>

1311
01:12:25.670 --> 01:12:27.710
<v Speaker 2>how much?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1312
01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:32.440
<v Speaker 2>that's the open question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Behold,</v>

1313
01:12:32.441 --> 01:12:37.441
<v Speaker 2>I will stand at the door and knock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if any man hear my voice and open </v>

1314
01:12:37.441 --> 01:12:40.351
<v Speaker 2>the door,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will come into him and will sup with </v>

1315
01:12:40.351 --> 01:12:40.351
<v Speaker 2>him and he with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a pretty good deal.</v>

1316
01:12:41.940 --> 01:12:43.680
<v Speaker 2>And the Angel said Unto Him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where is Sarah?</v>

1317
01:12:43.681 --> 01:12:45.480
<v Speaker 2>Thy Wife?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Abraham said,</v>

1318
01:12:45.550 --> 01:12:47.760
<v Speaker 2>behold in the tent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

1319
01:12:47.850 --> 01:12:51.000
<v Speaker 2>I will certainly return unto thee </v>
<v Speaker 2>according to the time of life.</v>

1320
01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:53.190
<v Speaker 2>And Lo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sarah,</v>

1321
01:12:53.191 --> 01:12:56.370
<v Speaker 2>thy wife shall have a son,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Sarah heard it in the tent door,</v>

1322
01:12:56.371 --> 01:13:01.371
<v Speaker 2>which was behind him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well </v>

1323
01:13:01.451 --> 01:13:04.810
<v Speaker 2>stricken in age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it had ceased to be with Sarah after</v>

1324
01:13:04.811 --> 01:13:06.220
<v Speaker 2>the manner of women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Therefore,</v>

1325
01:13:06.221 --> 01:13:10.150
<v Speaker 2>Sarah laughed within herself saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after I am waxed old,</v>

1326
01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:14.020
<v Speaker 2>shall I also have this pleasure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my lord being old also.</v>

1327
01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:19.440
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's kind of skeptical about the whole </v>

1328
01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:20.650
<v Speaker 2>Angel Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God having a child at 100 thing.</v>

1329
01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:21.870
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1330
01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:24.280
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and rightly so.</v>

1331
01:13:24.610 --> 01:13:29.610
<v Speaker 2>Rightly so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the Lord said Unto Abraham,</v>

1332
01:13:30.100 --> 01:13:33.250
<v Speaker 2>why did Sarah Laugh saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shall I have a sorority bear,</v>

1333
01:13:33.251 --> 01:13:38.251
<v Speaker 2>a child which am old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is anything too hard for the Lord at the</v>

1334
01:13:38.621 --> 01:13:41.050
<v Speaker 2>time appointed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will return unto thee according to the</v>

1335
01:13:41.051 --> 01:13:44.410
<v Speaker 2>time of life and Sarah shall have a son.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then Sarah denied saying,</v>

1336
01:13:44.411 --> 01:13:48.520
<v Speaker 2>I left not for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was afraid and he said Nay,</v>

1337
01:13:48.940 --> 01:13:50.230
<v Speaker 2>but though did slough</v>

1338
01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:01.760
<v Speaker 2>and the men rose up from dance and look </v>
<v Speaker 2>toward Sodom.</v>

1339
01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:05.680
<v Speaker 2>And Abraham went with them to bring them</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the way.</v>

1340
01:14:09.810 --> 01:14:13.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to make a small detour and </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk to you about this idea of potential</v>

1341
01:14:13.691 --> 01:14:16.900
<v Speaker 2>again because it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really thought about it a lot.</v>

1342
01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:21.960
<v Speaker 2>I think music speaks of potential,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I think music speaks of potential </v>

1343
01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:22.360
<v Speaker 2>bursting forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something.</v>

1344
01:14:22.570 --> 01:14:27.570
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that and that's why </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so deeply meaningful and it's this </v>

1345
01:14:27.570 --> 01:14:31.890
<v Speaker 2>continual pattern revelation of of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>next wonderful thing that might happen.</v>

1346
01:14:32.891 --> 01:14:37.891
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's that and people find that </v>

1347
01:14:37.891 --> 01:14:41.701
<v Speaker 2>deeply meaningful and then there's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea that we all have potential that </v>

1348
01:14:41.701 --> 01:14:46.561
<v Speaker 2>isn't realized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that we regard that potential even </v>

1349
01:14:46.561 --> 01:14:49.450
<v Speaker 2>though it's not realized as real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I can't get my head around at all.</v>

1350
01:14:49.451 --> 01:14:52.930
<v Speaker 2>It just doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then although everyone acts that way</v>

1351
01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:58.560
<v Speaker 2>and everyone believes it because white,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you act reflects what you believe </v>

1352
01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:02.580
<v Speaker 2>and you make judgments about yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>and others based on those beliefs and </v>

1353
01:15:02.580 --> 01:15:02.580
<v Speaker 2>their deep judgements.</v>

1354
01:15:02.580 --> 01:15:05.980
<v Speaker 2>So the idea that you believe that there </v>
<v Speaker 2>is such a thing as human potential,</v>

1355
01:15:05.981 --> 01:15:10.981
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's undeniable if you act at </v>

1356
01:15:10.981 --> 01:15:11.260
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you expect things of people at all,</v>

1357
01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:14.710
<v Speaker 2>then you're demonstrating your </v>
<v Speaker 2>commitment to the idea of potential,</v>

1358
01:15:14.950 --> 01:15:18.310
<v Speaker 2>but then I wonder if there's something </v>
<v Speaker 2>even deeper going on because we are very</v>

1359
01:15:18.311 --> 01:15:22.300
<v Speaker 2>materialistic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>modern people and there's great power in</v>

1360
01:15:22.301 --> 01:15:27.301
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously we've obtained great control </v>

1361
01:15:27.301 --> 01:15:29.020
<v Speaker 2>over the material world for better or </v>
<v Speaker 2>for worse,</v>

1362
01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:34.290
<v Speaker 2>but we do have a tendency to think of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world purely as a material structure</v>

1363
01:15:34.291 --> 01:15:39.291
<v Speaker 2>and he isn't really obvious to me that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world is exactly a material </v>

1364
01:15:39.291 --> 01:15:40.810
<v Speaker 2>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems to be to be something more like</v>

1365
01:15:40.811 --> 01:15:45.811
<v Speaker 2>constrained potential know because </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything is a certain way,</v>

1366
01:15:45.881 --> 01:15:50.881
<v Speaker 2>but everything that is a certain way </v>
<v Speaker 2>could be a multitude of other ways and </v>

1367
01:15:50.881 --> 01:15:54.931
<v Speaker 2>almost an infinite multitude of other </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways and the degree to which something </v>

1368
01:15:54.931 --> 01:15:58.951
<v Speaker 2>that is could be a multitude of other </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways is dependent on large part on how </v>

1369
01:15:58.951 --> 01:15:58.951
<v Speaker 2>you interact with it.</v>

1370
01:15:59.020 --> 01:16:04.020
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even with materials that were very </v>

1371
01:16:04.020 --> 01:16:05.971
<v Speaker 2>familiar with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we continue to discover new properties </v>

1372
01:16:05.971 --> 01:16:08.140
<v Speaker 2>and put them to use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like things are.</v>

1373
01:16:08.170 --> 01:16:10.930
<v Speaker 2>Things are compacted into their material</v>
<v Speaker 2>form,</v>

1374
01:16:11.170 --> 01:16:16.170
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't exhaust what they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially not in relationship to other </v>

1375
01:16:16.170 --> 01:16:20.401
<v Speaker 2>things and so it seems to me even if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't replace the materialist </v>

1376
01:16:20.401 --> 01:16:24.991
<v Speaker 2>perspective with the perspective that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's better to construe the world </v>

1377
01:16:24.991 --> 01:16:29.520
<v Speaker 2>construe being as if it's made of </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibility rather than the world as if </v>

1378
01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:33.001
<v Speaker 2>it's made of matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's at least useful to have that as an </v>

1379
01:16:33.001 --> 01:16:34.300
<v Speaker 2>additional viewpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that because you could say,</v>

1380
01:16:34.301 --> 01:16:39.301
<v Speaker 2>well the material philosophy is very </v>
<v Speaker 2>useful as a tool for obtaining certain </v>

1381
01:16:39.301 --> 01:16:39.640
<v Speaker 2>sorts of benefits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which it clearly is,</v>

1382
01:16:39.910 --> 01:16:42.400
<v Speaker 2>but then this more metaphysical </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>

1383
01:16:42.460 --> 01:16:47.460
<v Speaker 2>which I think is more accurate in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways that the world is a place of </v>

1384
01:16:47.460 --> 01:16:50.221
<v Speaker 2>potential is also an extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>useful way to approach the world and and</v>

1385
01:16:51.350 --> 01:16:52.810
<v Speaker 2>it is practically useful.</v>

1386
01:16:52.810 --> 01:16:57.810
<v Speaker 2>You know what we talked last week a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit about doing something as </v>

1387
01:16:57.810 --> 01:16:59.620
<v Speaker 2>simple as trying to organize a room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1388
01:16:59.860 --> 01:17:02.890
<v Speaker 2>it's by no means obvious how much </v>
<v Speaker 2>potential there is in a room,</v>

1389
01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:06.460
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a very large amount of potential</v>

1390
01:17:06.461 --> 01:17:08.950
<v Speaker 2>in any given room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tremendous amount of potential,</v>

1391
01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:13.960
<v Speaker 2>especially if it's connected with people</v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe an inexhaustible amount of </v>

1392
01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:17.951
<v Speaker 2>potential and maybe there's an </v>
<v Speaker 2>inexhaustible amount of potential </v>

1393
01:17:17.951 --> 01:17:19.820
<v Speaker 2>everywhere and that we just don't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>how to get access to it on.</v>

1394
01:17:19.821 --> 01:17:21.410
<v Speaker 2>That's certainly true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1395
01:17:21.430 --> 01:17:26.430
<v Speaker 2>it's certainly true to some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't know how to get access to all </v>

1396
01:17:26.430 --> 01:17:26.430
<v Speaker 2>the potential of our children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1397
01:17:26.430 --> 01:17:31.331
<v Speaker 2>or ourselves or our loved ones or it or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or the people that we know so well.</v>

1398
01:17:33.411 --> 01:17:38.411
<v Speaker 2>So I think the story is trying to hammer</v>
<v Speaker 2>that idea home to which is</v>

1399
01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:45.160
<v Speaker 2>don't be so sure that it's impossible or</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe don't let the assumption that's </v>

1400
01:17:45.651 --> 01:17:46.790
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's impossible.</v>

1401
01:17:46.791 --> 01:17:49.910
<v Speaker 2>Stop you from going forth into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

1402
01:17:49.940 --> 01:17:50.860
<v Speaker 2>That would be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a,</v>

1403
01:17:50.900 --> 01:17:55.900
<v Speaker 2>that's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you say that's like an </v>

1404
01:17:55.900 --> 01:17:55.900
<v Speaker 2>inoculation against nihilism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm,</v>

1405
01:17:56.090 --> 01:17:58.550
<v Speaker 2>for a long time I understood nihilism </v>
<v Speaker 2>very well.</v>

1406
01:17:58.551 --> 01:18:03.551
<v Speaker 2>I could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could understand its rationale </v>

1407
01:18:03.551 --> 01:18:06.610
<v Speaker 2>associated with the tragedy of life </v>
<v Speaker 2>associating with suffering and evil </v>

1408
01:18:06.610 --> 01:18:10.690
<v Speaker 2>associated with the observation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>finitude and the arbitrary and unjust </v>

1409
01:18:10.690 --> 01:18:12.470
<v Speaker 2>nature of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the more I've thought about it,</v>

1410
01:18:12.471 --> 01:18:16.460
<v Speaker 2>the less I've come to believe that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's any excuse for it whatsoever.</v>

1411
01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:20.480
<v Speaker 2>And I think the reason for that is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it forestalls effort.</v>

1412
01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:26.200
<v Speaker 2>It forestalls the ability to discover </v>
<v Speaker 2>for yourself maybe there's no reason to </v>

1413
01:18:27.291 --> 01:18:32.000
<v Speaker 2>be so God damn hopeless except that it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>easier to be useless now.</v>

1414
01:18:32.001 --> 01:18:34.910
<v Speaker 2>And believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not making that case.</v>

1415
01:18:35.570 --> 01:18:40.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that that's what's be </v>
<v Speaker 2>setting people who are clinically </v>

1416
01:18:40.570 --> 01:18:41.180
<v Speaker 2>depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>

1417
01:18:41.181 --> 01:18:44.600
<v Speaker 2>That's not my point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clinical depression is a terrible thing.</v>

1418
01:18:44.601 --> 01:18:49.130
<v Speaker 2>There's lots of reasons to be rendered </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be,</v>

1419
01:18:49.190 --> 01:18:52.460
<v Speaker 2>to be tossed into a catastrophic </v>
<v Speaker 2>condition that isn't what I mean.</v>

1420
01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:54.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean that kind of cynical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>arrogant,</v>

1421
01:18:54.950 --> 01:18:59.950
<v Speaker 2>rational,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hyper-intelligent nihilism that throws </v>

1422
01:18:59.950 --> 01:19:03.641
<v Speaker 2>the world away as if it's of little use </v>
<v Speaker 2>before it's been properly engaged,</v>

1423
01:19:03.711 --> 01:19:04.040
<v Speaker 2>with</v>

1424
01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:11.200
<v Speaker 2>better to engage with it and see what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens and better to make the </v>

1425
01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:12.020
<v Speaker 2>assumption that if the world isn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>returning to you,</v>

1426
01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:17.380
<v Speaker 2>what it is that you need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then are either you're not doing it </v>

1427
01:19:17.511 --> 01:19:21.320
<v Speaker 2>right or you've conceptualized what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>need badly.</v>

1428
01:19:22.430 --> 01:19:25.880
<v Speaker 2>Why not at least open yourself up to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that possibility,</v>

1429
01:19:26.540 --> 01:19:28.820
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you could be wrong.</v>

1430
01:19:29.570 --> 01:19:31.010
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're suffering,</v>

1431
01:19:31.011 --> 01:19:34.880
<v Speaker 2>this is a great thing to know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully if you're suffering,</v>

1432
01:19:34.881 --> 01:19:39.881
<v Speaker 2>you're wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because if you're suffering and you're </v>

1433
01:19:39.881 --> 01:19:39.881
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then there's nowhere to go,</v>

1434
01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:44.090
<v Speaker 2>so it's very useful to find out whatever</v>
<v Speaker 2>errors you might be committing.</v>

1435
01:19:44.270 --> 01:19:47.150
<v Speaker 2>Another thing that's really interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the Jews in the Old Testament,</v>

1436
01:19:47.390 --> 01:19:52.390
<v Speaker 2>it's a remarkable thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every single time they get flattened by </v>

1437
01:19:52.390 --> 01:19:52.760
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's always their fault.</v>

1438
01:19:53.420 --> 01:19:58.420
<v Speaker 2>They never say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world that God created was </v>

1439
01:19:58.841 --> 01:19:59.980
<v Speaker 2>corrupted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God is evil.</v>

1440
01:19:59.981 --> 01:20:01.720
<v Speaker 2>They never say that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No matter what happens,</v>

1441
01:20:01.721 --> 01:20:04.030
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter what catastrophe occurs,</v>

1442
01:20:04.031 --> 01:20:08.160
<v Speaker 2>when they have every reason to at least </v>
<v Speaker 2>put that hypothesis</v>

1443
01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:09.510
<v Speaker 1>forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't.</v>

1444
01:20:10.140 --> 01:20:12.930
<v Speaker 1>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we aired,</v>

1445
01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:15.720
<v Speaker 1>we walked off the path.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's our fault,</v>

1446
01:20:16.230 --> 01:20:17.940
<v Speaker 1>and that's hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1447
01:20:17.941 --> 01:20:22.941
<v Speaker 1>because it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It puts all the weight of human </v>

1448
01:20:22.941 --> 01:20:22.941
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe on the human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's very hard,</v>

1449
01:20:22.941 --> 01:20:26.880
<v Speaker 1>but the upside is it gives you the </v>
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>

1450
01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:32.480
<v Speaker 1>It opens up the door that it opens up </v>
<v Speaker 1>the possibility that you could be the </v>

1451
01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:35.901
<v Speaker 1>person that could set it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you would just let go of what's in </v>

1452
01:20:35.901 --> 01:20:37.230
<v Speaker 1>your way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that is,</v>

1453
01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.220
<v Speaker 1>and the men rose up from thence and look</v>
<v Speaker 1>toward Sodom,</v>

1454
01:20:46.221 --> 01:20:50.630
<v Speaker 1>and Abraham went with them to bring them</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the way and the Lord said,</v>

1455
01:20:52.010 --> 01:20:55.640
<v Speaker 1>shall I hide from Abraham?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That thing which I'm about to do.</v>

1456
01:20:56.150 --> 01:21:01.150
<v Speaker 1>Seeing that Abraham shall surely become </v>
<v Speaker 1>a great mighty nation and all the </v>

1457
01:21:01.150 --> 01:21:01.850
<v Speaker 1>nations of the Earth shall be blessed in</v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

1458
01:21:03.750 --> 01:21:07.950
<v Speaker 1>I guess God is talking to himself here </v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe he's talking to the angels,</v>

1459
01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:12.660
<v Speaker 1>but I think he's trying to make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>decision for I know him,</v>

1460
01:21:13.230 --> 01:21:18.230
<v Speaker 1>that he will command his children and </v>
<v Speaker 1>his household after him and they shall </v>

1461
01:21:18.230 --> 01:21:22.431
<v Speaker 1>keep the way of the Lord to do justice </v>
<v Speaker 1>and judgment that the Lord may bring </v>

1462
01:21:22.431 --> 01:21:25.830
<v Speaker 1>upon Abraham that which he has spoken of</v>
<v Speaker 1>him and the Lord said,</v>

1463
01:21:28.110 --> 01:21:30.480
<v Speaker 1>because of the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah</v>
<v Speaker 1>is great,</v>

1464
01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:32.760
<v Speaker 1>and because of their sin is very </v>
<v Speaker 1>grievous.</v>

1465
01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:38.720
<v Speaker 1>I will go down now and see whether they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have done altogether according to the </v>

1466
01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:40.230
<v Speaker 1>cry of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has come to me.</v>

1467
01:21:40.350 --> 01:21:41.520
<v Speaker 1>And if not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will know.</v>

1468
01:21:44.380 --> 01:21:49.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't know what's happened in Sodom </v>

1469
01:21:49.380 --> 01:21:51.091
<v Speaker 1>and Gomorrah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we know that God's got wind of it </v>

1470
01:21:51.091 --> 01:21:52.690
<v Speaker 1>and that that's not good and we know </v>
<v Speaker 1>that sin means to miss the mark,</v>

1471
01:21:53.380 --> 01:21:58.380
<v Speaker 1>and so we know that whatever has </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened in Sodom and Gomorrah means </v>

1472
01:21:58.380 --> 01:22:01.351
<v Speaker 1>that something about the natural ethical</v>
<v Speaker 1>order of things has been seriously </v>

1473
01:22:01.351 --> 01:22:05.650
<v Speaker 1>violated and there's a strong intimation</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Old Testament,</v>

1474
01:22:05.651 --> 01:22:07.690
<v Speaker 1>which I think by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is completely correct.</v>

1475
01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:12.720
<v Speaker 1>That if the proper order of being is </v>
<v Speaker 1>violated and that's something like the </v>

1476
01:22:13.811 --> 01:22:18.811
<v Speaker 1>balance between chaos and order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say if the proper balance of being is </v>

1477
01:22:19.390 --> 01:22:22.600
<v Speaker 1>violated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then all hell will break loose.</v>

1478
01:22:22.601 --> 01:22:25.960
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things I can tell you </v>
<v Speaker 1>from reading a very,</v>

1479
01:22:27.430 --> 01:22:32.430
<v Speaker 1>from reading a very comprehensive set of</v>
<v Speaker 1>myths from around the world is that </v>

1480
01:22:32.470 --> 01:22:35.740
<v Speaker 1>that's a conclusion that human beings </v>
<v Speaker 1>have come to everywhere.</v>

1481
01:22:37.310 --> 01:22:42.310
<v Speaker 1>Stay on the God Damn Path and be careful</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you start to mess around and </v>

1482
01:22:42.891 --> 01:22:47.891
<v Speaker 1>you deviate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you know that you're </v>

1483
01:22:47.891 --> 01:22:49.370
<v Speaker 1>deviating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things are not going to go well for you.</v>

1484
01:22:50.030 --> 01:22:52.880
<v Speaker 1>And that idea is everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's right.</v>

1485
01:22:52.881 --> 01:22:57.881
<v Speaker 1>I think the idea is right because there </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't that many ways of doing things </v>

1486
01:22:57.881 --> 01:22:59.540
<v Speaker 1>right and there's a lot of ways of doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>things wrong and if you do things wrong,</v>

1487
01:22:59.840 --> 01:23:02.930
<v Speaker 1>the consequences of doing them wrong can</v>
<v Speaker 1>be truly catastrophic.</v>

1488
01:23:02.931 --> 01:23:06.130
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I learned from reading</v>

1489
01:23:06.130 --> 01:23:09.700
<v Speaker 2>Victor Frankl first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn,</v>

1490
01:23:09.701 --> 01:23:14.470
<v Speaker 2>who I think did a deeper job was that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Vaclav Havel thought the same thing,</v>

1491
01:23:16.150 --> 01:23:21.150
<v Speaker 2>that these people were very much trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to understand what happened in places </v>

1492
01:23:21.150 --> 01:23:23.990
<v Speaker 2>like Nazi Germany and in the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 2>Union Solzhenitsyn's Gulag archipelago.</v>

1493
01:23:24.230 --> 01:23:28.330
<v Speaker 2>Calico is a particularly good analysis </v>
<v Speaker 2>of what happened in the Soviet Union and</v>

1494
01:23:28.331 --> 01:23:33.331
<v Speaker 2>his conclusion and it's a 2100 page </v>
<v Speaker 2>conclusion and it's like hammered home </v>

1495
01:23:33.611 --> 01:23:34.480
<v Speaker 2>with a hammer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1496
01:23:34.830 --> 01:23:37.110
<v Speaker 2>it's a book that everyone should read,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1497
01:23:37.150 --> 01:23:42.150
<v Speaker 2>assuming that you can read at 2100 page </v>
<v Speaker 2>scream because that's basically what it </v>

1498
01:23:42.150 --> 01:23:42.160
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1499
01:23:42.430 --> 01:23:47.430
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what he does is document just how </v>

1500
01:23:47.430 --> 01:23:47.430
<v Speaker 2>terrible things were in the Soviet Union</v>
<v Speaker 2>between 19,</v>

1501
01:23:47.430 --> 01:23:52.081
<v Speaker 2>19 in 1959.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And no matter how terrible you think </v>

1502
01:23:52.081 --> 01:23:52.120
<v Speaker 2>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you know the stories,</v>

1503
01:23:52.270 --> 01:23:57.270
<v Speaker 2>they were a lot more terrible than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they were terrible personally </v>

1504
01:23:57.270 --> 01:24:01.740
<v Speaker 2>because everyone lied.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were terrible in families because </v>

1505
01:24:01.780 --> 01:24:04.090
<v Speaker 2>two out of five people were government </v>
<v Speaker 2>informers.</v>

1506
01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:07.930
<v Speaker 2>They were terrible among friends because</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one could tell each other the truth.</v>

1507
01:24:07.990 --> 01:24:12.990
<v Speaker 2>They were terrible socially because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole system was corrupt and ban on </v>

1508
01:24:12.990 --> 01:24:16.321
<v Speaker 2>slave labor and they were terrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophically because the doctrine of </v>

1509
01:24:16.321 --> 01:24:21.031
<v Speaker 2>man upon which the state was founded was</v>
<v Speaker 2>hopeless and nihilistic and they were </v>

1510
01:24:21.130 --> 01:24:25.240
<v Speaker 2>murderous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>destructive and genocidal.</v>

1511
01:24:25.300 --> 01:24:30.300
<v Speaker 2>It's like they got it wrong at every </v>
<v Speaker 2>single level of analysis simultaneously.</v>

1512
01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:35.050
<v Speaker 2>And the question is why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Solzhenitsyn's answer,</v>

1513
01:24:35.051 --> 01:24:37.420
<v Speaker 2>and to some degree Victor Frankel's </v>
<v Speaker 2>answer as well.</v>

1514
01:24:37.421 --> 01:24:41.440
<v Speaker 2>And Vaclav Havel and I would say also </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nelson Mandela and Gandhi,</v>

1515
01:24:41.441 --> 01:24:45.220
<v Speaker 2>they all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they all ended up in the same conceptual</v>

1516
01:24:45.221 --> 01:24:50.221
<v Speaker 2>sphere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the answer was because individual </v>

1517
01:24:50.221 --> 01:24:52.711
<v Speaker 2>people lived crooked lives because </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual people swallowed lies and </v>

1518
01:24:53.141 --> 01:24:55.960
<v Speaker 2>spoke them and didn't stand up for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>truth.</v>

1519
01:24:56.380 --> 01:25:01.380
<v Speaker 2>And the corruption that spread from each</v>
<v Speaker 2>individual pulled the entire state </v>

1520
01:25:01.380 --> 01:25:04.630
<v Speaker 2>mechanism into that corruption and made </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything into hell.</v>

1521
01:25:05.020 --> 01:25:06.220
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are other theories,</v>

1522
01:25:06.610 --> 01:25:07.540
<v Speaker 2>a bed once,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1523
01:25:07.541 --> 01:25:09.730
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of the milgrim idea from </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1524
01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:13.540
<v Speaker 2>It's easy to make human beings obd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obedient to people in authority.</v>

1525
01:25:13.690 --> 01:25:17.350
<v Speaker 2>And I've explored that idea quite a bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>with regards to what happens happen,</v>

1526
01:25:17.351 --> 01:25:19.330
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the Nazi concentration camps.</v>

1527
01:25:19.331 --> 01:25:24.331
<v Speaker 2>And yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can set circumstances up so that </v>

1528
01:25:24.331 --> 01:25:27.580
<v Speaker 2>people are likely to be obedient to </v>
<v Speaker 2>orders that are pathological.</v>

1529
01:25:27.700 --> 01:25:29.320
<v Speaker 2>There's no doubt about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yes,</v>

1530
01:25:29.590 --> 01:25:32.140
<v Speaker 2>sometimes that's indicative of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>weakness of their character,</v>

1531
01:25:32.141 --> 01:25:37.141
<v Speaker 2>but that's not the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the idea that what happened in Nazi </v>

1532
01:25:37.141 --> 01:25:38.330
<v Speaker 2>Germany was because uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1533
01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:42.130
<v Speaker 2>population of good people listened to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>tiny minority of bad people.</v>

1534
01:25:42.260 --> 01:25:44.410
<v Speaker 2>That's a really how it's really not a </v>
<v Speaker 2>good theory.</v>

1535
01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:50.160
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Nazi ethos was there at every single</v>

1536
01:25:50.381 --> 01:25:52.720
<v Speaker 2>level of the social organization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1537
01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:55.780
<v Speaker 2>Right from the personal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1538
01:25:55.781 --> 01:25:57.070
<v Speaker 2>from the personal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1539
01:25:57.071 --> 01:25:59.650
<v Speaker 2>from the familial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the way up to the leadership.</v>

1540
01:25:59.651 --> 01:26:04.651
<v Speaker 2>It was the same thing all the way up and</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the way down and the same thing in </v>

1541
01:26:04.651 --> 01:26:04.820
<v Speaker 2>the Soviet Union.</v>

1542
01:26:05.990 --> 01:26:10.990
<v Speaker 4>And so we're also,</v>

1543
01:26:12.810 --> 01:26:17.810
<v Speaker 1>if you miss the mark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is apparently what the people of </v>

1544
01:26:17.810 --> 01:26:17.810
<v Speaker 1>Sodom and Gomorrah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had,</v>

1545
01:26:17.910 --> 01:26:22.910
<v Speaker 1>their sin was grievous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they risk destruction and I just </v>

1546
01:26:23.131 --> 01:26:28.131
<v Speaker 1>cannot see how after the 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody with any sense could possibly </v>

1547
01:26:28.710 --> 01:26:33.710
<v Speaker 1>not see that as true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that there's a line in the </v>

1548
01:26:33.710 --> 01:26:38.591
<v Speaker 1>Old Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that the fear of God is the </v>

1549
01:26:38.591 --> 01:26:38.591
<v Speaker 1>beginning of wisdom.</v>

1550
01:26:38.660 --> 01:26:43.660
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>frightened me badly was the realization </v>

1551
01:26:43.741 --> 01:26:48.741
<v Speaker 1>from reading soldier nets and under a </v>
<v Speaker 1>variety of other things that I was </v>

1552
01:26:48.741 --> 01:26:50.670
<v Speaker 1>reading at the same time that Dostoevsky</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well because he makes the same point.</v>

1553
01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:55.770
<v Speaker 1>He said that a human being is not only </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsible for everything they do,</v>

1554
01:26:55.771 --> 01:26:57.600
<v Speaker 1>but for everything that everyone else </v>
<v Speaker 1>does,</v>

1555
01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:01.020
<v Speaker 1>now you know that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was an epileptic and a mystic.</v>

1556
01:27:01.021 --> 01:27:03.180
<v Speaker 1>And that's a crazy thing to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also.</v>

1557
01:27:03.270 --> 01:27:06.420
<v Speaker 1>There's something about it that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you were better,</v>

1558
01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:09.210
<v Speaker 1>the people around you would be less </v>
<v Speaker 1>worse than they are.</v>

1559
01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:14.600
<v Speaker 1>And if you were good enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know how much better the </v>

1560
01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:16.100
<v Speaker 1>people around you would be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's this idea to,</v>

1561
01:27:16.130 --> 01:27:20.580
<v Speaker 1>you know that Christ took the sins of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world unto himself.</v>

1562
01:27:20.670 --> 01:27:22.350
<v Speaker 1>That's a complicated idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matt.</v>

1563
01:27:22.740 --> 01:27:24.510
<v Speaker 1>I wrestled with that one for a very long</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

1564
01:27:24.511 --> 01:27:27.120
<v Speaker 1>but I think I figured out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in part what it means.</v>

1565
01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:28.140
<v Speaker 1>It meant that</v>

1566
01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:35.220
<v Speaker 1>it's something like the realization of </v>
<v Speaker 1>complete humanity you see,</v>

1567
01:27:35.250 --> 01:27:40.250
<v Speaker 1>to take the sins of the world onto </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself is to realize that it's to </v>

1568
01:27:41.371 --> 01:27:44.430
<v Speaker 1>understand the Nazi concentration camp </v>
<v Speaker 1>guard,</v>

1569
01:27:45.540 --> 01:27:48.600
<v Speaker 1>because that person is human and so are </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1570
01:27:49.470 --> 01:27:54.470
<v Speaker 1>And so if you can't see you in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you don't know who you are.</v>

1571
01:27:55.380 --> 01:27:57.930
<v Speaker 1>And if you can see you in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1572
01:27:57.931 --> 01:28:02.931
<v Speaker 1>then you've started to take the sins of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world onto yourself because you've </v>

1573
01:28:02.931 --> 01:28:04.260
<v Speaker 1>actually started to take responsibility </v>
<v Speaker 1>for those terrible things.</v>

1574
01:28:04.261 --> 01:28:09.261
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the Motif of the motto of </v>

1575
01:28:09.261 --> 01:28:13.311
<v Speaker 1>the Holocaust Museum in Washington.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We must never forget.</v>

1576
01:28:14.190 --> 01:28:16.440
<v Speaker 1>That's close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>

1577
01:28:16.740 --> 01:28:17.910
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't forget,</v>

1578
01:28:18.210 --> 01:28:20.010
<v Speaker 1>you can't remember what you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>

1579
01:28:20.011 --> 01:28:21.900
<v Speaker 1>You will forget what you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>

1580
01:28:22.140 --> 01:28:23.130
<v Speaker 1>And the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1581
01:28:23.131 --> 01:28:25.440
<v Speaker 1>what are you supposed to remember about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Holocaust?</v>

1582
01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:30.800
<v Speaker 1>It was a historical event that 6 million</v>
<v Speaker 1>people died.</v>

1583
01:28:31.340 --> 01:28:32.900
<v Speaker 1>That's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's to remember,</v>

1584
01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:35.900
<v Speaker 1>wants to remember is that's what people </v>
<v Speaker 1>can do,</v>

1585
01:28:36.740 --> 01:28:41.740
<v Speaker 1>and you're one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't understand that you </v>

1586
01:28:41.740 --> 01:28:43.820
<v Speaker 1>could do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you don't know who you are.</v>

1587
01:28:47.940 --> 01:28:52.940
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

1588
01:28:54.820 --> 01:28:59.820
<v Speaker 1>So go ahead to making a case here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's making a case that the people of </v>

1589
01:28:59.820 --> 01:29:02.070
<v Speaker 1>Sodom and Gomorrah have sinned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's making a large</v>

1590
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:07.070
<v Speaker 2>rackets that even God has heard about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a very common mythological motif </v>

1591
01:29:07.070 --> 01:29:09.060
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the sins and,</v>

1592
01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:10.650
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1593
01:29:11.510 --> 01:29:16.510
<v Speaker 2>and what would you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The sins and noise of humanity can read </v>

1594
01:29:16.510 --> 01:29:19.530
<v Speaker 2>such a clamor that even the gods here in</v>
<v Speaker 2>and are forced to intervene.</v>

1595
01:29:19.770 --> 01:29:22.320
<v Speaker 2>That comes all the way from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mesopotamian creation story.</v>

1596
01:29:23.220 --> 01:29:24.720
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's logical.</v>

1597
01:29:24.721 --> 01:29:25.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're sending.</v>

1598
01:29:25.980 --> 01:29:26.610
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1599
01:29:26.611 --> 01:29:27.300
<v Speaker 2>so what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1600
01:29:27.301 --> 01:29:28.260
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not so wide.</v>

1601
01:29:28.261 --> 01:29:32.370
<v Speaker 2>It means that God's offended and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything is at risk.</v>

1602
01:29:32.371 --> 01:29:35.160
<v Speaker 2>That's what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that's something worth taking.</v>

1603
01:29:35.161 --> 01:29:40.161
<v Speaker 2>Seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The men turned their faces from thence </v>

1604
01:29:40.161 --> 01:29:44.631
<v Speaker 2>and went towards Sodom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Abraham stood yet before the Lord </v>

1605
01:29:44.631 --> 01:29:48.170
<v Speaker 2>and Abraham drew near and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will thou also destroy the righteous </v>

1606
01:29:48.170 --> 01:29:52.191
<v Speaker 2>with the wicked?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a very interesting part of the </v>

1607
01:29:52.191 --> 01:29:55.431
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A friend of mine took me to task the </v>

1608
01:29:55.431 --> 01:29:58.200
<v Speaker 2>other day when I was writing about </v>
<v Speaker 2>portraying the old testament.</v>

1609
01:29:58.200 --> 01:30:03.200
<v Speaker 2>God is pretty harsh and judgmental and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the New Testament God is sort of all </v>

1610
01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:03.200
<v Speaker 2>loving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

1611
01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:04.950
<v Speaker 2>which he isn't because there's the whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>book of revelations thing.</v>

1612
01:30:04.951 --> 01:30:09.951
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I got that partly from reading </v>

1613
01:30:09.951 --> 01:30:11.640
<v Speaker 2>northrop Frye,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but going through the old testament more</v>

1614
01:30:11.641 --> 01:30:13.260
<v Speaker 2>detail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I realized that that's,</v>

1615
01:30:13.350 --> 01:30:18.350
<v Speaker 2>that is too low resolution </v>
<v Speaker 2>interpretation and that God who is </v>

1616
01:30:18.510 --> 01:30:22.920
<v Speaker 2>dispensing a fair bit of harsh justice </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the old testament is also someone who</v>

1617
01:30:22.921 --> 01:30:26.670
<v Speaker 2>can be negotiated with weirdly enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what happens here.</v>

1618
01:30:26.730 --> 01:30:31.730
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Abraham has just been told that </v>

1619
01:30:31.730 --> 01:30:34.430
<v Speaker 2>whatever's going on in Sodom and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Gomorrah is seriously not good and that </v>

1620
01:30:34.430 --> 01:30:35.490
<v Speaker 2>God's going to do something about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he takes it upon himself.</v>

1621
01:30:35.491 --> 01:30:40.491
<v Speaker 2>This is an act of mercy to to ask God to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be a bit more judicious,</v>

1622
01:30:40.531 --> 01:30:41.190
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1623
01:30:41.191 --> 01:30:41.640
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna.</v>

1624
01:30:41.641 --> 01:30:42.710
<v Speaker 2>Wipe out the city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1625
01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:44.260
<v Speaker 2>bad things are happening there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1626
01:30:44.350 --> 01:30:49.350
<v Speaker 2>there's probably a few people in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>damn city that aren't completely </v>

1627
01:30:49.350 --> 01:30:49.890
<v Speaker 2>corrupted by what's going on there.</v>

1628
01:30:50.010 --> 01:30:51.420
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an open question,</v>

1629
01:30:51.750 --> 01:30:53.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's an open question.</v>

1630
01:30:53.221 --> 01:30:58.221
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many people were there were in Nazi </v>

1631
01:30:58.221 --> 01:30:59.190
<v Speaker 2>Germany who weren't completely corrupted</v>
<v Speaker 2>by what was going on in Nazi Germany and</v>

1632
01:30:59.191 --> 01:31:04.191
<v Speaker 2>the same thing could be said about China</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the same thing could be said about </v>

1633
01:31:04.191 --> 01:31:04.800
<v Speaker 2>the Soviet Union.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1634
01:31:04.950 --> 01:31:06.870
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps there was a person somewhere who</v>

1635
01:31:06.871 --> 01:31:09.180
<v Speaker 2>didn't understand at some level what was</v>
<v Speaker 2>happening,</v>

1636
01:31:09.181 --> 01:31:14.181
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole issue of willful blindness </v>

1637
01:31:14.181 --> 01:31:14.670
<v Speaker 2>certainly springs to mind if nothing </v>
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

1638
01:31:15.060 --> 01:31:18.360
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Abraham decides to intercede with God on</v>

1639
01:31:18.361 --> 01:31:21.960
<v Speaker 2>behalf of these people who are going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be destroyed.</v>

1640
01:31:22.530 --> 01:31:25.080
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will also destroy the righteous with the</v>

1641
01:31:25.081 --> 01:31:30.081
<v Speaker 2>wicked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perhaps there'll be 50 righteous people </v>

1642
01:31:30.081 --> 01:31:33.771
<v Speaker 2>within the city will you will also </v>
<v Speaker 2>destroy and not spare the place for the </v>

1643
01:31:33.771 --> 01:31:37.131
<v Speaker 2>50 righteous that are there that that'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>be far from the to do after this manner.</v>

1644
01:31:37.330 --> 01:31:40.230
<v Speaker 2>He's Kinda reminding God that he's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>good guy as far as I can tell,</v>

1645
01:31:40.440 --> 01:31:45.440
<v Speaker 2>to slay the righteous with the wicked </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the righteous should be as the </v>

1646
01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:47.460
<v Speaker 2>wicked be far from the should not the </v>
<v Speaker 2>judge of the Earth do right?</v>

1647
01:31:48.510 --> 01:31:50.430
<v Speaker 2>And the Lord said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I find in Sodom,</v>

1648
01:31:50.431 --> 01:31:53.010
<v Speaker 2>50 right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he seems a bit taken aback here to me.</v>

1649
01:31:53.160 --> 01:31:55.710
<v Speaker 2>If I find in Sodom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>50 righteous within the city,</v>

1650
01:31:55.711 --> 01:31:57.780
<v Speaker 2>then I will spare the place for their </v>
<v Speaker 2>sakes.</v>

1651
01:31:57.990 --> 01:31:59.890
<v Speaker 2>And Abraham answered and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>behold,</v>

1652
01:31:59.891 --> 01:32:00.110
<v Speaker 2>now</v>

1653
01:32:00.110 --> 01:32:02.650
<v Speaker 1>I have taken upon me to speak upon the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lord unto the Lord,</v>

1654
01:32:02.950 --> 01:32:04.090
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I am,</v>

1655
01:32:04.180 --> 01:32:09.180
<v Speaker 1>but dust and ashes possibly there shall </v>
<v Speaker 1>lack five of the 50 righteous will.</v>

1656
01:32:10.611 --> 01:32:13.450
<v Speaker 1>They'll destroy all the city for lack of</v>
<v Speaker 1>five.</v>

1657
01:32:13.870 --> 01:32:15.640
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

1658
01:32:15.641 --> 01:32:17.800
<v Speaker 1>God said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I find they're 45,</v>

1659
01:32:17.801 --> 01:32:21.700
<v Speaker 1>I will not destroy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Abraham spoke unto him yet again and</v>

1660
01:32:21.701 --> 01:32:26.701
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's kind of sneaking up on God here </v>

1661
01:32:26.701 --> 01:32:27.820
<v Speaker 1>peradventure there shall be 40 found </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1662
01:32:27.940 --> 01:32:30.280
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will not do it for 40 sake.</v>

1663
01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:32.830
<v Speaker 1>And he said unto him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1664
01:32:32.890 --> 01:32:37.890
<v Speaker 1>let the Lord not be angry and I will </v>
<v Speaker 1>speak possibly there shall be 30 found </v>

1665
01:32:39.671 --> 01:32:40.870
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And God said,</v>

1666
01:32:40.871 --> 01:32:45.871
<v Speaker 1>I won't do it if I find 30 there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Abraham who seems really to be </v>

1667
01:32:45.871 --> 01:32:48.160
<v Speaker 1>pushing his luck by this point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

1668
01:32:48.161 --> 01:32:53.161
<v Speaker 1>behold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have taken upon me to speak unto the </v>

1669
01:32:53.161 --> 01:32:53.161
<v Speaker 1>Lord,</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly there shall be found there.</v>

1670
01:32:53.161 --> 01:32:55.840
<v Speaker 1>And God said I won't destroy it for </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] Sake.</v>

1671
01:32:57.350 --> 01:32:59.680
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1672
01:33:00.460 --> 01:33:02.380
<v Speaker 1>let the Lord not be angry and I will </v>
<v Speaker 1>speak yet,</v>

1673
01:33:02.381 --> 01:33:05.650
<v Speaker 1>but this once perhaps 10 shall be found </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1674
01:33:05.651 --> 01:33:08.290
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will not destroy it for 10 sick.</v>

1675
01:33:09.370 --> 01:33:14.370
<v Speaker 1>And the Lord went his way in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as he had left communing with </v>

1676
01:33:14.370 --> 01:33:14.370
<v Speaker 1>Abraham and Abraham returned unto his </v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

1677
01:33:14.770 --> 01:33:19.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two ways you can read that part </v>

1678
01:33:19.770 --> 01:33:20.040
<v Speaker 1>of the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is that three,</v>

1679
01:33:20.050 --> 01:33:23.530
<v Speaker 1>let's say you can bargain with God even </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're kind of annoying about it.</v>

1680
01:33:23.531 --> 01:33:28.531
<v Speaker 1>So that's kind of interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second is that even if there's a </v>

1681
01:33:29.561 --> 01:33:32.200
<v Speaker 1>minority of good in a place that isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

1682
01:33:32.201 --> 01:33:35.590
<v Speaker 1>it won't be slated for destruction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of a good thing.</v>

1683
01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:41.280
<v Speaker 1>And the third is a minority of good in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>place can keep it from being destroyed.</v>

1684
01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:46.000
<v Speaker 1>And that's a really good thing too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I believe that as well.</v>

1685
01:33:46.390 --> 01:33:51.310
<v Speaker 1>I think that good is more powerful than </v>
<v Speaker 1>evil naivety isn't.</v>

1686
01:33:51.311 --> 01:33:56.311
<v Speaker 1>But I think that good is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that in a place that's </v>

1687
01:33:56.311 --> 01:34:00.241
<v Speaker 1>corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a minority of people who stand forth </v>

1688
01:34:00.241 --> 01:34:02.410
<v Speaker 1>against the corruption can prevail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1689
01:34:08.060 --> 01:34:08.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1690
01:34:08.631 --> 01:34:13.010
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the best examples of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>again was Alexander Solzhenitsyn because</v>

1691
01:34:13.011 --> 01:34:16.520
<v Speaker 1>he was in the terrible work camps when </v>
<v Speaker 1>he wrote his book.</v>

1692
01:34:16.521 --> 01:34:21.521
<v Speaker 1>He memorized most of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not an easy thing to do when </v>

1693
01:34:21.521 --> 01:34:22.040
<v Speaker 1>it's 2100 pages long and set and very </v>
<v Speaker 1>tiny font.</v>

1694
01:34:22.490 --> 01:34:27.490
<v Speaker 1>And he memorized most of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he wrote it and it was one of </v>

1695
01:34:28.431 --> 01:34:30.140
<v Speaker 1>the things that brought down the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 1>Union.</v>

1696
01:34:30.260 --> 01:34:32.210
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was published in the 19 seventies.</v>

1697
01:34:33.020 --> 01:34:35.930
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in we're in the west and the first thing</v>

1698
01:34:36.350 --> 01:34:41.350
<v Speaker 1>that happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least initially was that the </v>

1699
01:34:42.770 --> 01:34:47.770
<v Speaker 1>communism as an ethical system last </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely all credibility whatsoever </v>

1700
01:34:47.770 --> 01:34:51.701
<v Speaker 1>among anyone who is even vaguely </v>
<v Speaker 1>educated immediately upon the </v>

1701
01:34:51.701 --> 01:34:55.091
<v Speaker 1>publication of the Gulag archipelago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He pulled the moral slots out from </v>

1702
01:34:55.091 --> 01:34:56.930
<v Speaker 1>underneath it and the book was </v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely one of the.</v>

1703
01:34:57.320 --> 01:34:58.020
<v Speaker 1>There were many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

1704
01:34:58.020 --> 01:35:03.020
<v Speaker 2>it was definitely one of the reasons why</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rotten system crumbled and fell </v>

1705
01:35:03.020 --> 01:35:07.930
<v Speaker 2>without a war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a great example of how one </v>

1706
01:35:07.930 --> 01:35:09.680
<v Speaker 2>person can take on a tyranny and </v>
<v Speaker 2>prevail.</v>

1707
01:35:10.580 --> 01:35:15.580
<v Speaker 2>So and he's not the only person who did </v>
<v Speaker 2>that sort of thing because what Gandhi </v>

1708
01:35:15.580 --> 01:35:15.580
<v Speaker 2>did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same thing.</v>

1709
01:35:15.580 --> 01:35:20.321
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think the English were the </v>

1710
01:35:20.321 --> 01:35:21.710
<v Speaker 2>Russians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but things were not so good in India and</v>

1711
01:35:22.310 --> 01:35:27.310
<v Speaker 2>what Gandhi did in India under the </v>
<v Speaker 2>influence by the way of Leo Tolstoy was </v>

1712
01:35:30.211 --> 01:35:32.980
<v Speaker 2>also a remarkable example of a single </v>
<v Speaker 2>person intervening in,</v>

1713
01:35:32.981 --> 01:35:37.981
<v Speaker 2>in catastrophe and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and setting it far more right than it </v>

1714
01:35:37.981 --> 01:35:37.981
<v Speaker 2>could be.</v>

1715
01:35:38.160 --> 01:35:38.640
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1716
01:35:42.010 --> 01:35:45.610
<v Speaker 2>and there came two angels to Sodom at </v>
<v Speaker 2>evening and lot.</v>

1717
01:35:46.210 --> 01:35:51.210
<v Speaker 2>Remember lot is Abraham's nephew sat in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the gate of Sodom and lot seeing them </v>

1718
01:35:51.210 --> 01:35:55.051
<v Speaker 2>rose up to meet them and he bowed </v>
<v Speaker 2>himself with his face toward the ground </v>

1719
01:35:55.051 --> 01:35:56.380
<v Speaker 2>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>behold my lords turn in.</v>

1720
01:35:56.381 --> 01:36:01.381
<v Speaker 2>I pray you into your servant's house and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tarry all night and wash your feet and </v>

1721
01:36:01.381 --> 01:36:02.230
<v Speaker 2>you shall rise up early and go on your </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways.</v>

1722
01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:08.160
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's Abraham's nephew and kinsmen and </v>

1723
01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:08.160
<v Speaker 2>acting in exactly the manner that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Abraham does.</v>

1724
01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:10.960
<v Speaker 2>He shows hospitality to these people and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they said,</v>

1725
01:36:10.961 --> 01:36:11.590
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1726
01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:16.360
<v Speaker 2>we'll stay in the street all night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he insisted.</v>

1727
01:36:16.420 --> 01:36:21.420
<v Speaker 2>He pressed upon them greatly and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>turned in unto him and entered into his </v>

1728
01:36:21.420 --> 01:36:23.530
<v Speaker 2>house and he made them a feast and baked</v>
<v Speaker 2>on leaving bread and they did eat,</v>

1729
01:36:23.740 --> 01:36:25.630
<v Speaker 2>but before they lay down the men of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>city,</v>

1730
01:36:25.631 --> 01:36:27.940
<v Speaker 2>even the men of Sodom Compas the house </v>
<v Speaker 2>round,</v>

1731
01:36:27.941 --> 01:36:32.941
<v Speaker 2>both old and young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the people from every quarter and </v>

1732
01:36:32.941 --> 01:36:36.631
<v Speaker 2>they called into lot and said unto him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where are the men which came into the </v>

1733
01:36:36.631 --> 01:36:39.661
<v Speaker 2>this night?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bring them out to us that we may know </v>

1734
01:36:39.661 --> 01:36:39.661
<v Speaker 2>them</v>

1735
01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.040
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's</v>

1736
01:36:43.330 --> 01:36:46.120
<v Speaker 2>the part of the story that's been used </v>
<v Speaker 2>as</v>

1737
01:36:47.510 --> 01:36:48.690
<v Speaker 2>diatribe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

1738
01:36:48.691 --> 01:36:53.691
<v Speaker 2>against homosexuality because to know is</v>
<v Speaker 2>to engage in sexual intercourse and the </v>

1739
01:36:56.850 --> 01:37:01.850
<v Speaker 2>inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah were </v>
<v Speaker 2>willing to care for strangers out of </v>

1740
01:37:01.850 --> 01:37:06.210
<v Speaker 2>lot's house and use and abuse them as </v>
<v Speaker 2>they see fit.</v>

1741
01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:08.040
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so what are they doing?</v>

1742
01:37:08.310 --> 01:37:09.870
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're violating the principle,</v>

1743
01:37:10.410 --> 01:37:13.170
<v Speaker 2>the principles that govern appropriate </v>
<v Speaker 2>conduct with a stranger,</v>

1744
01:37:13.620 --> 01:37:18.620
<v Speaker 2>and maybe the stranger is something you </v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't mess with because you don't </v>

1745
01:37:18.620 --> 01:37:20.220
<v Speaker 2>know who you're messing with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's like warning number one,</v>

1746
01:37:20.610 --> 01:37:25.610
<v Speaker 2>while they're violent and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>violating the essential principles of </v>

1747
01:37:25.610 --> 01:37:26.790
<v Speaker 2>hospitality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then there's the sexual thing here I</v>

1748
01:37:26.791 --> 01:37:31.791
<v Speaker 2>think is isn't the sexual thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here is something more like the absolute</v>

1749
01:37:33.511 --> 01:37:38.511
<v Speaker 2>danger of immediate gratification,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexual included outside the constraints </v>

1750
01:37:39.151 --> 01:37:42.150
<v Speaker 2>of any civilized structure whatsoever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1751
01:37:42.151 --> 01:37:45.180
<v Speaker 2>Because that's as uncivilized behavior </v>
<v Speaker 2>as you could possibly hope for,</v>

1752
01:37:45.510 --> 01:37:48.060
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Strangers come into your city,</v>

1753
01:37:48.630 --> 01:37:51.480
<v Speaker 2>they're in the house of someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of your city.</v>

1754
01:37:51.630 --> 01:37:55.620
<v Speaker 2>They're being shown hospitality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A mob shows up and says,</v>

1755
01:37:56.090 --> 01:37:57.510
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come over man,</v>

1756
01:37:57.960 --> 01:38:02.960
<v Speaker 2>we're going to do whatever the hell we </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to them and it's not going to be </v>

1757
01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:03.840
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you get in the way,</v>

1758
01:38:04.260 --> 01:38:06.060
<v Speaker 2>things are going to go even worse for </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1759
01:38:07.140 --> 01:38:07.680
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1760
01:38:10.150 --> 01:38:13.990
<v Speaker 2>so that's what it seems to me to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's completely dysregulated behavior.</v>

1761
01:38:14.260 --> 01:38:19.260
<v Speaker 2>It's behavior that's outside the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the confines of any civilized structure </v>

1762
01:38:21.011 --> 01:38:22.510
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an indic.</v>

1763
01:38:22.540 --> 01:38:27.540
<v Speaker 2>It's an indication that the insight into</v>
<v Speaker 2>the social structure of the entire </v>

1764
01:38:27.540 --> 01:38:31.801
<v Speaker 2>society has collapsed so that there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing left for the inhabitants to do </v>

1765
01:38:32.530 --> 01:38:37.530
<v Speaker 2>except to engage in the most brutal of </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediate gratification and destruction.</v>

1766
01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:42.310
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what does he do?</v>

1767
01:38:44.380 --> 01:38:47.050
<v Speaker 2>I pray the brethren do not do so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wickedly behold,</v>

1768
01:38:47.051 --> 01:38:49.210
<v Speaker 2>now I have two daughters which have not </v>
<v Speaker 2>yet known.</v>

1769
01:38:49.211 --> 01:38:50.350
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me.</v>

1770
01:38:50.351 --> 01:38:55.351
<v Speaker 2>I pray you bring them out onto you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you do to them is as good and your eyes </v>

1771
01:38:55.351 --> 01:38:59.701
<v Speaker 2>only unto these men do nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And therefore for therefore came they </v>

1772
01:38:59.701 --> 01:39:02.890
<v Speaker 2>the under the shadow of my roof.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1773
01:39:03.460 --> 01:39:05.280
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to know what to make of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1774
01:39:05.420 --> 01:39:10.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't exactly seem like the </v>

1775
01:39:11.211 --> 01:39:13.130
<v Speaker 2>advisable thing for a lot to do</v>

1776
01:39:13.690 --> 01:39:14.080
<v Speaker 4>and</v>

1777
01:39:16.970 --> 01:39:21.970
<v Speaker 2>but I think at least what it is is an </v>
<v Speaker 2>indication of the degree to which he </v>

1778
01:39:21.970 --> 01:39:26.081
<v Speaker 2>took the solemn vow of hospitality </v>
<v Speaker 2>seriously.</v>

1779
01:39:26.661 --> 01:39:31.661
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's the idea that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>story is trying to promote.</v>

1780
01:39:36.260 --> 01:39:37.940
<v Speaker 2>And the angel said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stand back.</v>

1781
01:39:38.570 --> 01:39:39.470
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the man said,</v>

1782
01:39:39.471 --> 01:39:41.630
<v Speaker 2>stand back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they said again,</v>

1783
01:39:41.720 --> 01:39:46.720
<v Speaker 2>this one fellow came into sojourn to </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk to us and he will need to be a </v>

1784
01:39:46.720 --> 01:39:47.000
<v Speaker 2>judge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

1785
01:39:47.001 --> 01:39:49.010
<v Speaker 2>We'll deal worse with him than with </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1786
01:39:49.490 --> 01:39:52.730
<v Speaker 2>And they press sore upon the man even </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot and came near to break the door.</v>

1787
01:39:52.910 --> 01:39:55.730
<v Speaker 2>Maybe what lot thought was something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1788
01:39:56.120 --> 01:39:56.790
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

1789
01:39:56.791 --> 01:40:01.791
<v Speaker 2>we're done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're all done with this mop and perhaps</v>

1790
01:40:02.811 --> 01:40:07.811
<v Speaker 2>I can spare some of us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they press sore upon the man even </v>

1791
01:40:08.711 --> 01:40:13.711
<v Speaker 2>loud and came near to break the door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the man this is the angels put forth</v>

1792
01:40:14.051 --> 01:40:16.330
<v Speaker 2>their hand and a lot into the host to </v>
<v Speaker 2>them and shut the door.</v>

1793
01:40:16.331 --> 01:40:18.850
<v Speaker 2>And they smote the men that were at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>door of the house with blindness,</v>

1794
01:40:18.970 --> 01:40:23.970
<v Speaker 2>both small and great so that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>wearied themselves to find the door so </v>

1795
01:40:24.921 --> 01:40:29.240
<v Speaker 2>they were so corrupt that they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>blind and could not see now even to find</v>

1796
01:40:29.241 --> 01:40:34.241
<v Speaker 2>the door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the man said unto lot has thou here </v>

1797
01:40:34.241 --> 01:40:35.810
<v Speaker 2>any besides any family member's son in </v>
<v Speaker 2>law,</v>

1798
01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:39.410
<v Speaker 2>and they sons and my daughters and </v>
<v Speaker 2>whoever thou hast in the city,</v>

1799
01:40:39.560 --> 01:40:43.880
<v Speaker 2>get them out of the place for we will </v>
<v Speaker 2>destroy this place because of the cry of</v>

1800
01:40:43.881 --> 01:40:46.400
<v Speaker 2>them is wax and great before the face of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Lord.</v>

1801
01:40:46.550 --> 01:40:48.800
<v Speaker 2>And the Lord has sent us to destroy it</v>

1802
01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:53.470
<v Speaker 2>and lot went out and spake unto his sons</v>
<v Speaker 2>law.</v>

1803
01:40:54.330 --> 01:40:54.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1804
01:40:54.630 --> 01:40:58.350
<v Speaker 1>Which married his daughters and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>up you get out of this place,</v>

1805
01:40:58.410 --> 01:41:03.410
<v Speaker 1>for the Lord will destroy the city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he seemed as one that marked unto </v>

1806
01:41:03.410 --> 01:41:07.280
<v Speaker 1>his sons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sons in law from in the morning arose </v>

1807
01:41:07.280 --> 01:41:07.480
<v Speaker 1>then the angels hastened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blot,</v>

1808
01:41:07.490 --> 01:41:08.870
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>arise.</v>

1809
01:41:08.871 --> 01:41:11.030
<v Speaker 1>Take thy wife and my two daughters which</v>
<v Speaker 1>are here,</v>

1810
01:41:11.240 --> 01:41:13.760
<v Speaker 1>lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the city.</v>

1811
01:41:14.870 --> 01:41:17.770
<v Speaker 1>And while he lingered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lingered,</v>

1812
01:41:18.430 --> 01:41:23.430
<v Speaker 1>the men laid hold upon his hands and </v>
<v Speaker 1>upon the hand of his wife and upon the </v>

1813
01:41:23.430 --> 01:41:26.641
<v Speaker 1>hand of his two daughters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Lord Being Merciful unto him and </v>

1814
01:41:26.641 --> 01:41:26.770
<v Speaker 1>they brought him forth and set him </v>
<v Speaker 1>without the city.</v>

1815
01:41:28.050 --> 01:41:33.050
<v Speaker 1>So he's still.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an indication of the danger of </v>

1816
01:41:33.121 --> 01:41:36.750
<v Speaker 1>not acting with appropriate haste.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the time has come,</v>

1817
01:41:36.751 --> 01:41:41.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean lots already seen what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He saw that the men came to his door,</v>

1818
01:41:41.490 --> 01:41:44.070
<v Speaker 1>he saw that they were murderers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rapists.</v>

1819
01:41:44.610 --> 01:41:49.610
<v Speaker 1>He saw that the angels took them out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's still hesitant to leave that place.</v>

1820
01:41:52.980 --> 01:41:57.980
<v Speaker 1>And so I guess one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>this story requires people to ask </v>

1821
01:41:57.980 --> 01:42:01.821
<v Speaker 1>themselves is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you in a place that's so bad that </v>

1822
01:42:01.991 --> 01:42:06.470
<v Speaker 1>you should leave?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or when are you in a place that's so bad</v>

1823
01:42:06.471 --> 01:42:11.471
<v Speaker 1>that you should leave?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you are in a place that's so bad </v>

1824
01:42:11.471 --> 01:42:14.561
<v Speaker 1>that you should leave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the time to leave is now because </v>

1825
01:42:14.561 --> 01:42:14.780
<v Speaker 1>there's no time to waste.</v>

1826
01:42:17.140 --> 01:42:19.720
<v Speaker 1>And it came to pass when they had </v>
<v Speaker 1>brought them forth abroad that he said,</v>

1827
01:42:19.721 --> 01:42:22.420
<v Speaker 1>escape for the life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look not behind you.</v>

1828
01:42:23.500 --> 01:42:28.500
<v Speaker 1>Neither stay vow and all the plain </v>
<v Speaker 1>escape to the mountain lest thou be </v>

1829
01:42:28.500 --> 01:42:28.500
<v Speaker 1>consumed,</v>

1830
01:42:28.500 --> 01:42:29.700
<v Speaker 1>and Lord said to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1831
01:42:29.701 --> 01:42:34.701
<v Speaker 1>not not so my Lord,</v>
<v Speaker 1>behold now they serve and have found </v>

1832
01:42:34.701 --> 01:42:35.910
<v Speaker 1>grace in my sight and now has magnified </v>
<v Speaker 1>thy mercy,</v>

1833
01:42:36.120 --> 01:42:38.100
<v Speaker 1>which though has showed me into saving </v>
<v Speaker 1>my life,</v>

1834
01:42:38.250 --> 01:42:42.210
<v Speaker 1>but I cannot escape to the mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less some evil take me and I die.</v>

1835
01:42:42.390 --> 01:42:45.930
<v Speaker 1>Behold now there's a city near to flee </v>
<v Speaker 1>unto and it's a little one,</v>

1836
01:42:46.320 --> 01:42:49.110
<v Speaker 1>which means maybe it's not big and </v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupt like Sodom and Gomorrah.</v>

1837
01:42:49.200 --> 01:42:50.960
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me escape thither is it?</v>

1838
01:42:50.961 --> 01:42:52.980
<v Speaker 1>Is it not a little one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my soul shall live.</v>

1839
01:42:53.550 --> 01:42:55.120
<v Speaker 1>Matthew Henry said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot linger.</v>

1840
01:42:55.130 --> 01:43:00.130
<v Speaker 1>He trifled thus many who are under </v>
<v Speaker 1>convictions about their spiritual state </v>

1841
01:43:00.130 --> 01:43:02.130
<v Speaker 1>and the necessity of a changed differ </v>
<v Speaker 1>that needful work.</v>

1842
01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:07.260
<v Speaker 1>And he said unto him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

1843
01:43:07.261 --> 01:43:09.750
<v Speaker 1>I've accepted the angel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he said unto him,</v>

1844
01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:14.760
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have accepted the concerning this </v>

1845
01:43:14.760 --> 01:43:16.311
<v Speaker 1>thing also that I will not overthrow </v>
<v Speaker 1>this city for the which thou has spoken </v>

1846
01:43:16.311 --> 01:43:17.190
<v Speaker 1>to small city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hasty escape feather for.</v>

1847
01:43:17.191 --> 01:43:19.620
<v Speaker 1>I cannot do anything to allow gone </v>
<v Speaker 1>hither.</v>

1848
01:43:20.100 --> 01:43:21.780
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the name of the city was Zaur.</v>

1849
01:43:21.810 --> 01:43:24.300
<v Speaker 1>That's where Laura went at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sun was rezoned upon the earth wind,</v>

1850
01:43:24.301 --> 01:43:29.301
<v Speaker 1>lot entered into [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the Lord rained upon Sodom and </v>

1851
01:43:29.301 --> 01:43:33.500
<v Speaker 1>Gomorrah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brimstone and fire from the Lord out of </v>

1852
01:43:33.500 --> 01:43:35.691
<v Speaker 1>Heaven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he overthrew the cities and all the </v>

1853
01:43:35.691 --> 01:43:38.361
<v Speaker 1>plane and all the inhabitants of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cities and that which grew up on the </v>

1854
01:43:38.361 --> 01:43:40.230
<v Speaker 1>ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but his wife looked back from behind him</v>

1855
01:43:40.860 --> 01:43:45.860
<v Speaker 1>and she became a pillar of salt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>known histology for catastrophe.</v>

1856
01:43:50.490 --> 01:43:55.490
<v Speaker 1>I think what that means is that when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>leave what's not good,</v>

1857
01:43:56.150 --> 01:44:00.110
<v Speaker 1>you wash the dust off your feet and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't look back,</v>

1858
01:44:00.920 --> 01:44:05.920
<v Speaker 1>and that's a very harsh lesson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is accurate.</v>

1859
01:44:07.141 --> 01:44:12.141
<v Speaker 1>A bit in the New Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of the necessity for immediate </v>

1860
01:44:12.241 --> 01:44:14.040
<v Speaker 1>action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are some of the harsher words that</v>

1861
01:44:14.041 --> 01:44:17.220
<v Speaker 1>Christ said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is from Matthew Eight.</v>

1862
01:44:17.520 --> 01:44:22.520
<v Speaker 1>Christ is addressing a multitude and </v>
<v Speaker 1>asking people to follow him,</v>

1863
01:44:23.431 --> 01:44:26.430
<v Speaker 1>and a disciple comes up to him and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lord,</v>

1864
01:44:26.820 --> 01:44:29.280
<v Speaker 1>suffer me first to go and bury my </v>
<v Speaker 1>father.</v>

1865
01:44:29.490 --> 01:44:31.440
<v Speaker 1>Seems like a perfectly reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 1>request,</v>

1866
01:44:31.680 --> 01:44:33.990
<v Speaker 1>but Jesus said unto him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>follow me,</v>

1867
01:44:34.170 --> 01:44:36.450
<v Speaker 1>and let the dead bury their dead.</v>

1868
01:44:38.520 --> 01:44:41.220
<v Speaker 1>This is from Matthew 12.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1869
01:44:41.221 --> 01:44:44.430
<v Speaker 1>he had talked to the people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>behold his mother and his brethren stood</v>

1870
01:44:44.431 --> 01:44:47.220
<v Speaker 1>without desiring to speak with him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then one said to him,</v>

1871
01:44:48.030 --> 01:44:49.170
<v Speaker 1>behold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thy mother and I,</v>

1872
01:44:49.171 --> 01:44:54.171
<v Speaker 1>brethren,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stand without desiring to speak with </v>

1873
01:44:54.171 --> 01:44:56.391
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Jesus answered the one who was </v>

1874
01:44:56.391 --> 01:44:56.910
<v Speaker 1>telling him and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is my mother and who is my brother's</v>

1875
01:44:59.510 --> 01:45:01.880
<v Speaker 1>for whosoever shall do the will of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>father,</v>

1876
01:45:01.881 --> 01:45:06.881
<v Speaker 1>which is in heaven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same as my brother and sister and </v>

1877
01:45:06.881 --> 01:45:06.990
<v Speaker 1>mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1878
01:45:06.991 --> 01:45:11.991
<v Speaker 1>what does all that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means that there's no excuses </v>

1879
01:45:13.211 --> 01:45:15.910
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever for not getting up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting out it.</v>

1880
01:45:16.210 --> 01:45:19.600
<v Speaker 1>That's what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it means that</v>

1881
01:45:21.950 --> 01:45:25.910
<v Speaker 1>it even means that when people are beset</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a catastrophe,</v>

1882
01:45:25.911 --> 01:45:27.710
<v Speaker 1>like let's say the death of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>father,</v>

1883
01:45:28.960 --> 01:45:33.960
<v Speaker 1>that they are prone to use that as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>excuse for not going about the business </v>

1884
01:45:33.960 --> 01:45:36.140
<v Speaker 1>that they should be going about because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can say to themselves,</v>

1885
01:45:36.141 --> 01:45:38.480
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would except,</v>

1886
01:45:39.260 --> 01:45:41.330
<v Speaker 1>and except there's always good reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1887
01:45:41.331 --> 01:45:46.331
<v Speaker 1>believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always good reasons for not </v>

1888
01:45:46.331 --> 01:45:48.011
<v Speaker 1>doing what you should know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's for sure the reasons pile up day </v>

1889
01:45:48.011 --> 01:45:49.370
<v Speaker 1>after day to not do what you should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially cause you're,</v>

1890
01:45:49.500 --> 01:45:54.500
<v Speaker 1>you're aiming at things in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can put them off and definitely </v>

1891
01:45:54.500 --> 01:45:57.230
<v Speaker 1>right because of the demands of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these stories,</v>

1892
01:45:57.380 --> 01:45:59.470
<v Speaker 1>they say a variety of things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1893
01:45:59.471 --> 01:46:04.471
<v Speaker 1>and especially in combination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say when you leave somewhere </v>

1894
01:46:04.471 --> 01:46:04.471
<v Speaker 1>terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do not look back.</v>

1895
01:46:04.610 --> 01:46:09.610
<v Speaker 1>There's known astrologer that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the letting the dead parts of </v>

1896
01:46:10.251 --> 01:46:14.770
<v Speaker 1>yourself go and then if you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>follow the good,</v>

1897
01:46:14.771 --> 01:46:19.771
<v Speaker 1>there's no excuse not to do it and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>means no excuse whatsoever under any </v>

1898
01:46:19.771 --> 01:46:24.451
<v Speaker 1>circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it's taken even farther with </v>

1899
01:46:24.451 --> 01:46:24.451
<v Speaker 1>regards to familial relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

1900
01:46:24.451 --> 01:46:26.230
<v Speaker 1>You can't even let them stand in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

1901
01:46:27.900 --> 01:46:32.900
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's all true and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen virtually all of that in my </v>

1902
01:46:32.900 --> 01:46:36.831
<v Speaker 1>clinical practice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there is no excuse whatsoever for </v>

1903
01:46:37.981 --> 01:46:40.830
<v Speaker 1>not getting at what it is that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be doing.</v>

1904
01:46:41.550 --> 01:46:44.070
<v Speaker 1>And I think there's something else </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going on here,</v>

1905
01:46:44.130 --> 01:46:47.520
<v Speaker 1>especially in the new testament stories </v>
<v Speaker 1>which has even made maybe worse,</v>

1906
01:46:47.521 --> 01:46:52.521
<v Speaker 1>which is it's absolutely to justify your</v>
<v Speaker 1>inaction with a catastrophe that </v>

1907
01:46:53.701 --> 01:46:56.730
<v Speaker 1>extracts mercy from other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1908
01:46:56.731 --> 01:46:59.190
<v Speaker 1>There's a tricky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tricky game that's going well,</v>

1909
01:46:59.191 --> 01:47:04.191
<v Speaker 1>of course I can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at the terrible thing that's just </v>

1910
01:47:04.191 --> 01:47:04.191
<v Speaker 1>happened to me and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1911
01:47:04.191 --> 01:47:08.330
<v Speaker 1>I understand you're absolved of any </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessity to move forward because of </v>

1912
01:47:08.330 --> 01:47:09.960
<v Speaker 1>your current catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1913
01:47:09.961 --> 01:47:11.580
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually you're not,</v>

1914
01:47:11.910 --> 01:47:16.910
<v Speaker 1>and it's rather rude of you to use it as</v>
<v Speaker 1>an excuse and it's certainly </v>

1915
01:47:16.910 --> 01:47:20.511
<v Speaker 1>counterproductive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Abraham got up early in the morning </v>

1916
01:47:20.511 --> 01:47:24.981
<v Speaker 1>to the place where he stood before the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lord and he looked toward Sodom and </v>

1917
01:47:24.981 --> 01:47:27.891
<v Speaker 1>Gomorrah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and toward the land of the plane and </v>

1918
01:47:27.891 --> 01:47:27.891
<v Speaker 1>behold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and low,</v>

1919
01:47:27.891 --> 01:47:29.400
<v Speaker 1>the smoke of the country went up as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>smoke,</v>

1920
01:47:29.401 --> 01:47:30.180
<v Speaker 1>have a furnace,</v>

1921
01:47:33.680 --> 01:47:38.680
<v Speaker 1>and it came to pass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When God destroyed the cities of the </v>

1922
01:47:38.680 --> 01:47:40.971
<v Speaker 1>plain that God remembered Abraham and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sent lot out of the midst of the </v>

1923
01:47:40.971 --> 01:47:44.271
<v Speaker 1>overthrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he overthrew the cities in which </v>

1924
01:47:44.271 --> 01:47:45.180
<v Speaker 1>lot dwelled and lot went out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] and dwelt in the mountain.</v>

1925
01:47:45.181 --> 01:47:50.181
<v Speaker 1>And his two daughters with him for he </v>
<v Speaker 1>filler feared to dwell in Zuora and he </v>

1926
01:47:50.181 --> 01:47:53.811
<v Speaker 1>dwelt in a cave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He and his two daughters and the </v>

1927
01:47:53.811 --> 01:47:54.340
<v Speaker 1>firstborn said unto the younger her </v>
<v Speaker 1>father was,</v>

1928
01:47:55.320 --> 01:48:00.320
<v Speaker 1>and there's not a man in the earth to </v>
<v Speaker 1>come in to us after the manner of all </v>

1929
01:48:00.320 --> 01:48:03.441
<v Speaker 1>the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come let us make our father drink wine </v>

1930
01:48:03.441 --> 01:48:04.170
<v Speaker 1>and we will lie with him that we may </v>
<v Speaker 1>preserve the seed of our father</v>

1931
01:48:05.640 --> 01:48:10.640
<v Speaker 1>and they made their father drink wine </v>
<v Speaker 1>that night in the firstborn went in and </v>

1932
01:48:10.640 --> 01:48:13.611
<v Speaker 1>lay with her father and he perceived not</v>
<v Speaker 1>when she laid down Norwin sheet rows and</v>

1933
01:48:13.771 --> 01:48:16.590
<v Speaker 1>it came to pass on the morrow that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>firstborn said unto the younger,</v>

1934
01:48:16.770 --> 01:48:18.990
<v Speaker 1>behold I lay yesterday night with my </v>
<v Speaker 1>father.</v>

1935
01:48:19.260 --> 01:48:21.450
<v Speaker 1>Let us make him drink wine this night </v>
<v Speaker 1>also,</v>

1936
01:48:21.451 --> 01:48:25.080
<v Speaker 1>and gold out in and lie with him that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>may preserve seat of our father.</v>

1937
01:48:25.890 --> 01:48:28.020
<v Speaker 1>And they made their father drink wine </v>
<v Speaker 1>that night also.</v>

1938
01:48:28.290 --> 01:48:33.290
<v Speaker 1>And the younger a and lay with him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he perceived not when she laid down </v>

1939
01:48:33.290 --> 01:48:34.160
<v Speaker 1>Norwin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she arose that us,</v>

1940
01:48:34.170 --> 01:48:36.870
<v Speaker 1>we're both the daughters of lot with </v>
<v Speaker 1>child by their father.</v>

1941
01:48:41.210 --> 01:48:42.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the story,</v>

1942
01:48:43.850 --> 01:48:48.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stories outlined the catastrophe of </v>

1943
01:48:48.850 --> 01:48:51.531
<v Speaker 1>Sodom and Gomorrah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially the ethical catastrophe of </v>

1944
01:48:51.531 --> 01:48:55.821
<v Speaker 1>Sodom and Gomorrah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the disillusion of the civilized </v>

1945
01:48:55.821 --> 01:48:59.040
<v Speaker 1>constraints that should regulate all </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior and then the city is destroyed,</v>

1946
01:48:59.041 --> 01:49:00.750
<v Speaker 1>but there's an echo of it afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1947
01:49:00.751 --> 01:49:05.751
<v Speaker 1>Because law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it had lived in Sodom and Gomorrah and </v>

1948
01:49:05.751 --> 01:49:09.950
<v Speaker 1>what happens to him even after his </v>
<v Speaker 1>escapes is that he gets tangled into an </v>

1949
01:49:10.231 --> 01:49:14.600
<v Speaker 1>incestuous web,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I think that that's a.</v>

1950
01:49:15.540 --> 01:49:20.540
<v Speaker 1>it's not foreshadowing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's post shadowing if there's such a </v>

1951
01:49:20.540 --> 01:49:21.330
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an echo of of what?</v>

1952
01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:26.960
<v Speaker 1>It's an echo and a reminder of how </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible whatever it was that was </v>

1953
01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:30.900
<v Speaker 1>happening in Sodom and Gomorrah was that</v>
<v Speaker 1>even after escaping,</v>

1954
01:49:31.350 --> 01:49:34.440
<v Speaker 1>the inequity still remained</v>

1955
01:49:40.970 --> 01:49:43.310
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a pretty good place to stop.</v>

1956
01:49:43.490 --> 01:49:47.980
<v Speaker 1>We got through two of three stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's not too bad.</v>

1957
01:49:47.981 --> 01:49:52.981
<v Speaker 1>Next week I'll talk about the sacrifice </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Isaac and see if I can get into the </v>

1958
01:49:53.770 --> 01:49:56.980
<v Speaker 1>next stories as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And next week is the last lecture,</v>

1959
01:49:57.190 --> 01:50:02.190
<v Speaker 1>except I talked to the theater people </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it looks like I'll be able to rent </v>

1960
01:50:02.190 --> 01:50:05.020
<v Speaker 1>the theater once a month at least for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the next four months.</v>

1961
01:50:05.530 --> 01:50:10.530
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to do that and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>announced when I'm going to do that and </v>

1962
01:50:10.530 --> 01:50:14.220
<v Speaker 1>I'll continue doing this probably as </v>
<v Speaker 1>long as you all continue to come and </v>

1963
01:50:14.220 --> 01:50:14.220
<v Speaker 1>listen.</v>

1964
01:50:16.970 --> 01:50:21.970
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

1965
01:50:32.790 --> 01:50:36.390
<v Speaker 1>I could tell you something cool that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened too if you want.</v>

1966
01:50:36.960 --> 01:50:41.960
<v Speaker 1>So some of you may know that there was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>memo leaked at Google.</v>

1967
01:50:45.240 --> 01:50:49.030
<v Speaker 1>How many of you know about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How you.</v>

1968
01:50:52.140 --> 01:50:57.140
<v Speaker 1>So a colleague of the man who released </v>
<v Speaker 1>the memo got ahold of me yesterday and </v>

1969
01:50:58.171 --> 01:51:02.880
<v Speaker 1>said that the man who wrote the memo </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to talk to me.</v>

1970
01:51:03.750 --> 01:51:07.380
<v Speaker 1>So I interviewed him today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made a youtube video out of it.</v>

1971
01:51:07.650 --> 01:51:12.650
<v Speaker 1>We went over his memo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was scientifically accurate in my </v>

1972
01:51:12.650 --> 01:51:16.701
<v Speaker 1>estimation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I'm going to release that </v>

1973
01:51:16.701 --> 01:51:16.860
<v Speaker 1>hopefully tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we'll see how that goes.</v>

1974
01:51:17.540 --> 01:51:22.540
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

1975
01:51:25.330 --> 01:51:27.380
<v Speaker 1>He got fired last night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A right.</v>

1976
01:51:27.700 --> 01:51:31.120
<v Speaker 1>He got fired for perpetuating gender </v>
<v Speaker 1>stereotypes.</v>

1977
01:51:31.540 --> 01:51:35.080
<v Speaker 1>He told me today that his last </v>
<v Speaker 1>performance review,</v>

1978
01:51:35.380 --> 01:51:40.380
<v Speaker 1>he had been given superb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the top few percentiles of the </v>

1979
01:51:41.140 --> 01:51:44.150
<v Speaker 1>employee distribution at Google,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1980
01:51:44.590 --> 01:51:48.730
<v Speaker 1>Perpetuating gender stereotypes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went through his document.</v>

1981
01:51:49.030 --> 01:51:54.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he said a single thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't substantiated by a fairly </v>

1982
01:51:54.030 --> 01:51:58.411
<v Speaker 1>dense scientific literature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not to say that the scientific </v>

1983
01:51:58.411 --> 01:52:00.340
<v Speaker 1>literature is necessarily 100 percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>correct because it never is,</v>

1984
01:52:00.640 --> 01:52:05.640
<v Speaker 1>but certainly to say that he was not </v>
<v Speaker 1>merely spouting out misogynistic and </v>

1985
01:52:06.881 --> 01:52:09.850
<v Speaker 1>ethnically biased opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quite the contrary.</v>

1986
01:52:10.270 --> 01:52:15.270
<v Speaker 1>So we had a nice discussion about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>today and hopefully the discussion will </v>

1987
01:52:15.270 --> 01:52:15.270
<v Speaker 1>continue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1988
01:52:15.890 --> 01:52:17.800
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>

1989
01:52:19.360 --> 01:52:23.680
<v Speaker 1>Hello?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1990
01:52:23.681 --> 01:52:28.681
<v Speaker 1>it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean look at a couple of things about </v>

1991
01:52:28.681 --> 01:52:28.681
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1992
01:52:28.681 --> 01:52:32.270
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my daughter has had a catastrophic life </v>

1993
01:52:32.270 --> 01:52:35.461
<v Speaker 1>in many ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of things went wrong with her </v>

1994
01:52:35.461 --> 01:52:37.540
<v Speaker 1>physically really bad things and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>went perfectly,</v>

1995
01:52:37.750 --> 01:52:38.950
<v Speaker 1>so like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank God.</v>

1996
01:52:40.080 --> 01:52:44.360
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

1997
01:52:44.480 --> 01:52:46.010
<v Speaker 1>So then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the other thing</v>

1998
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:49.320
<v Speaker 5>is I love kids now infants,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well you know,</v>

1999
01:52:50.770 --> 01:52:52.740
<v Speaker 5>it's not that I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not.</v>

2000
01:52:53.330 --> 01:52:58.330
<v Speaker 5>Infants are cool and interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm not sure exactly what to do with</v>

2001
01:52:58.491 --> 01:53:03.491
<v Speaker 5>them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but once they're about six months old </v>

2002
01:53:03.491 --> 01:53:06.551
<v Speaker 5>and then from then on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I love having kids around so I'm </v>

2003
01:53:06.551 --> 01:53:08.090
<v Speaker 5>thrilled about the fact that this has </v>
<v Speaker 5>happened,</v>

2004
01:53:08.091 --> 01:53:10.100
<v Speaker 5>so hooray.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hooray.</v>

2005
01:53:10.490 --> 01:53:12.240
<v Speaker 5>So thanks for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2006
01:53:12.910 --> 01:53:17.910
<v Speaker 5>so more as an aside,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but what you said about not pushing </v>

2007
01:53:17.910 --> 01:53:20.310
<v Speaker 5>aside of the things that day kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>made me think of Nike's motto.</v>

2008
01:53:20.340 --> 01:53:22.800
<v Speaker 5>Just do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought cool.</v>

2009
01:53:23.310 --> 01:53:28.310
<v Speaker 5>But my question was that when you were </v>
<v Speaker 5>talking about circumcision being a </v>

2010
01:53:28.310 --> 01:53:32.181
<v Speaker 5>contractual relationship between </v>
<v Speaker 5>sacrifice and compared it to a girl </v>

2011
01:53:35.491 --> 01:53:38.340
<v Speaker 5>having a period.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That didn't make a lot of sense to me,</v>

2012
01:53:38.400 --> 01:53:43.400
<v Speaker 5>but also it seems to me that it being a </v>
<v Speaker 5>sacrifice requires some form of </v>

2013
01:53:49.510 --> 01:53:54.510
<v Speaker 5>willingness basically from the one </v>
<v Speaker 5>having certain decisions that don't </v>

2014
01:53:54.510 --> 01:53:57.220
<v Speaker 5>necessarily want to put forward what you</v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't.</v>

2015
01:53:57.260 --> 01:54:02.260
<v Speaker 5>You said you specifically didn't want to</v>
<v Speaker 5>address as two infants not having any </v>

2016
01:54:02.260 --> 01:54:06.151
<v Speaker 5>choice in the matter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but more in the context of it being a </v>

2017
01:54:06.151 --> 01:54:06.740
<v Speaker 5>sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How does that.</v>

2018
01:54:06.890 --> 01:54:09.110
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's how a modern person would</v>

2019
01:54:09.111 --> 01:54:13.160
<v Speaker 1>see it and I think that there is some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's some utility in that,</v>

2020
01:54:13.161 --> 01:54:14.600
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

2021
01:54:14.601 --> 01:54:15.780
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an incomplete,</v>

2022
01:54:15.830 --> 01:54:17.570
<v Speaker 1>incomplete to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2023
01:54:17.780 --> 01:54:22.780
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things that happens </v>
<v Speaker 1>with God and Abraham is that God tells </v>

2024
01:54:22.780 --> 01:54:23.150
<v Speaker 1>Abraham that he has take care of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>

2025
01:54:23.300 --> 01:54:28.300
<v Speaker 1>his children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the question is exactly how do you </v>

2026
01:54:28.300 --> 01:54:31.481
<v Speaker 1>take care of your children?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is sometimes you make </v>

2027
01:54:31.481 --> 01:54:34.070
<v Speaker 1>decisions for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you might say,</v>

2028
01:54:34.071 --> 01:54:39.071
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be better if they could make the </v>

2029
01:54:39.071 --> 01:54:39.071
<v Speaker 1>decisions for themselves and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually the case.</v>

2030
01:54:39.170 --> 01:54:40.400
<v Speaker 1>So you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2031
01:54:40.401 --> 01:54:45.401
<v Speaker 1>I won't bring my kids to church because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be better if they could make the </v>

2032
01:54:45.401 --> 01:54:46.370
<v Speaker 1>decision for themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what I did with my kids,</v>

2033
01:54:46.670 --> 01:54:51.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not so sure that it was a good </v>

2034
01:54:51.670 --> 01:54:51.670
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>

2035
01:54:51.670 --> 01:54:55.390
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I'm not so sure it was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good idea was because there are a bunch </v>

2036
01:54:55.390 --> 01:54:58.391
<v Speaker 1>of things they didn't learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the degree to which your parents </v>

2037
01:54:58.391 --> 01:55:01.380
<v Speaker 1>should exercise control over his or her </v>
<v Speaker 1>child is indeterminant.</v>

2038
01:55:01.850 --> 01:55:06.850
<v Speaker 1>But I guess the hope is that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>exercise the minimum amount of control </v>

2039
01:55:06.850 --> 01:55:09.920
<v Speaker 1>necessary to maximize the child's </v>
<v Speaker 1>probability of success,</v>

2040
01:55:10.070 --> 01:55:15.070
<v Speaker 1>and that certainly requires adopting </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility for making decisions as </v>

2041
01:55:15.070 --> 01:55:16.940
<v Speaker 1>well because the child can't make </v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions,</v>

2042
01:55:17.150 --> 01:55:22.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't just let the child lay there </v>

2043
01:55:22.150 --> 01:55:22.150
<v Speaker 1>and make decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2044
01:55:22.150 --> 01:55:23.330
<v Speaker 1>That's just not going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you might say,</v>

2045
01:55:23.331 --> 01:55:26.600
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Abraham has no right to impose something</v>

2046
01:55:26.601 --> 01:55:31.601
<v Speaker 1>like circumcision on his children and </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they an be an because it's a </v>

2047
01:55:31.701 --> 01:55:33.440
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something that they should be doing</v>

2048
01:55:33.441 --> 01:55:38.441
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem with that is that </v>

2049
01:55:38.441 --> 01:55:41.500
<v Speaker 1>Abraham also has no right to abdicate </v>
<v Speaker 1>his responsibility to his children in </v>

2050
01:55:41.870 --> 01:55:44.430
<v Speaker 1>the name of some hypothetical merciful </v>
<v Speaker 1>illness.</v>

2051
01:55:45.210 --> 01:55:47.460
<v Speaker 1>And those two things have to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>balanced.</v>

2052
01:55:47.760 --> 01:55:48.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2053
01:55:48.780 --> 01:55:51.510
<v Speaker 1>according to the story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Abraham got the balance right because of</v>

2054
01:55:51.511 --> 01:55:56.511
<v Speaker 1>course he's made this covenant with God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now exactly what that means in people's </v>

2055
01:55:56.511 --> 01:55:58.140
<v Speaker 1>day to day lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While that's a harder issue,</v>

2056
01:55:58.141 --> 01:55:59.370
<v Speaker 1>but I would say</v>

2057
01:56:02.380 --> 01:56:05.560
<v Speaker 1>I think in the modern world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people err on the side of.</v>

2058
01:56:06.310 --> 01:56:11.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're more likely to err on </v>

2059
01:56:11.310 --> 01:56:13.510
<v Speaker 1>the side of taking insufficient </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility for their children,</v>

2060
01:56:14.470 --> 01:56:17.410
<v Speaker 1>letting them be free in ways that aren't</v>
<v Speaker 1>productive.</v>

2061
01:56:18.100 --> 01:56:20.860
<v Speaker 1>That's how it looks to me often because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're afraid of their children.</v>

2062
01:56:21.700 --> 01:56:25.890
<v Speaker 1>So that's about the best I can do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2063
01:56:33.370 --> 01:56:38.370
<v Speaker 6>I was recently,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've recently started reading maps of </v>

2064
01:56:38.370 --> 01:56:42.331
<v Speaker 6>meaning and I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there was something in the introduction </v>

2065
01:56:42.331 --> 01:56:45.061
<v Speaker 6>to that story that I found,</v>
<v Speaker 6>particularly the introduction that you </v>

2066
01:56:45.061 --> 01:56:45.061
<v Speaker 6>wrote before you went until the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2067
01:56:45.061 --> 01:56:49.000
<v Speaker 6>that I found particularly compelling,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guess,</v>

2068
01:56:49.280 --> 01:56:54.280
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the part when you're talking about the </v>

2069
01:56:54.280 --> 01:56:54.280
<v Speaker 6>split that developed in your psyche when</v>
<v Speaker 6>you were,</v>

2070
01:56:54.280 --> 01:56:55.310
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all your,</v>

2071
01:56:55.780 --> 01:56:57.520
<v Speaker 6>I think you talked about one of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>earlier lecture,</v>

2072
01:56:57.521 --> 01:57:00.340
<v Speaker 6>I talked about it a little bit today,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a little bit today as well.</v>

2073
01:57:00.670 --> 01:57:05.670
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you said something in that paragraph </v>

2074
01:57:05.670 --> 01:57:05.670
<v Speaker 6>there that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2075
01:57:06.010 --> 01:57:11.010
<v Speaker 6>what you said was you have to earn the </v>
<v Speaker 6>right to identify with an idea yet </v>

2076
01:57:11.010 --> 01:57:13.120
<v Speaker 6>certain ideas for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Certain ideas for sure.</v>

2077
01:57:13.180 --> 01:57:15.760
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so basically my question is how should a</v>

2078
01:57:15.761 --> 01:57:19.900
<v Speaker 6>young person such as myself who doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 6>have a whole lot of life experience,</v>

2079
01:57:20.280 --> 01:57:25.280
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like be able to read literature and </v>

2080
01:57:25.280 --> 01:57:25.280
<v Speaker 6>psychology and interact with,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2081
01:57:25.280 --> 01:57:30.271
<v Speaker 6>the wisdom of culture and then </v>
<v Speaker 6>incorporate it into a structure that's </v>

2082
01:57:30.271 --> 01:57:30.271
<v Speaker 6>still authentically their own.</v>

2083
01:57:31.820 --> 01:57:32.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2084
01:57:32.301 --> 01:57:37.301
<v Speaker 1>I think the way you asked that question </v>
<v Speaker 1>means that you're actually doing a </v>

2085
01:57:37.301 --> 01:57:37.301
<v Speaker 1>pretty good job of that.</v>

2086
01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.430
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

2087
01:57:40.680 --> 01:57:41.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that,</v>

2088
01:57:41.530 --> 01:57:44.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean that because that was a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>carefully formulated question and it was</v>

2089
01:57:44.941 --> 01:57:49.941
<v Speaker 1>obvious that you were actually looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>for an answer instead of trying to tell </v>

2090
01:57:49.941 --> 01:57:50.310
<v Speaker 1>the audience a bunch of things that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>knew,</v>

2091
01:57:50.520 --> 01:57:52.740
<v Speaker 1>which often happens with questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2092
01:57:52.741 --> 01:57:57.741
<v Speaker 1>And so it's often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very annoying for the audience to </v>

2093
01:57:57.741 --> 01:57:58.080
<v Speaker 1>be subject to questions like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2094
01:57:58.290 --> 01:57:59.160
<v Speaker 1>Because it's a form of</v>

2095
01:57:59.800 --> 01:58:04.060
<v Speaker 3>thank you</v>

2096
01:58:04.140 --> 01:58:06.360
<v Speaker 1>because it's a form of manipulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2097
01:58:06.720 --> 01:58:09.870
<v Speaker 1>well all cap this off with a question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but actually it's a speech.</v>

2098
01:58:11.300 --> 01:58:13.770
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I would say you probably already know</v>

2099
01:58:13.771 --> 01:58:18.771
<v Speaker 1>the answer to that and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then I could elaborate on that a </v>

2100
01:58:18.771 --> 01:58:22.221
<v Speaker 1>little bit is like there are a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>books that people have historically </v>

2101
01:58:22.221 --> 01:58:24.720
<v Speaker 1>regarded as great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might as well start by assuming that</v>

2102
01:58:24.750 --> 01:58:28.170
<v Speaker 1>they're at least greater than you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2103
01:58:28.670 --> 01:58:33.670
<v Speaker 1>And then and to approach them with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>frame of mind because even if there's </v>

2104
01:58:34.891 --> 01:58:35.900
<v Speaker 1>much in them that</v>

2105
01:58:37.060 --> 01:58:42.060
<v Speaker 1>perhaps is no longer relevant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often less than people assume there's </v>

2106
01:58:42.060 --> 01:58:46.441
<v Speaker 1>much in the met will be of extreme </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefit to you and then with regards to </v>

2107
01:58:46.441 --> 01:58:51.121
<v Speaker 1>making the mirrors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kind of wisdom that you get from </v>

2108
01:58:51.121 --> 01:58:54.841
<v Speaker 1>great books is practical wisdom and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>act it out and so then what you do is </v>

2109
01:58:55.481 --> 01:58:58.690
<v Speaker 1>you try to incorporate what you learn </v>
<v Speaker 1>into your life,</v>

2110
01:58:58.720 --> 01:59:01.630
<v Speaker 1>into your practices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then if you incorporate it into your</v>

2111
01:59:01.631 --> 01:59:06.631
<v Speaker 1>life and your practices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you build a bridge between you and the </v>

2112
01:59:06.631 --> 01:59:06.631
<v Speaker 1>great idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2113
01:59:06.631 --> 01:59:11.611
<v Speaker 1>Because you figured out how to manifest </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself in the conditions of your own </v>

2114
01:59:11.611 --> 01:59:14.941
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's something like making the </v>

2115
01:59:14.941 --> 01:59:14.941
<v Speaker 1>archetipal personal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

2116
01:59:15.250 --> 01:59:16.960
<v Speaker 1>which is the right thing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2117
01:59:16.961 --> 01:59:21.961
<v Speaker 1>It's the proper thing to do because that</v>
<v Speaker 1>expands your life upward and outward and</v>

2118
01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:27.000
<v Speaker 1>ennobles you and brings you up as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But so humility is part of it.</v>

2119
01:59:27.430 --> 01:59:32.430
<v Speaker 1>It's like approach these books as if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have something to teach you and </v>

2120
01:59:32.430 --> 01:59:37.141
<v Speaker 1>then it's humility again in the second </v>
<v Speaker 1>place is don't take the ideas to </v>

2121
01:59:38.591 --> 01:59:43.240
<v Speaker 1>yourself until you lived the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there'll be lots of time for that.</v>

2122
01:59:43.241 --> 01:59:43.990
<v Speaker 1>And besides,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2123
01:59:43.991 --> 01:59:46.990
<v Speaker 1>even as a young person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like you have nothing to say,</v>

2124
01:59:47.920 --> 01:59:52.920
<v Speaker 1>but the only things that you have to say</v>
<v Speaker 1>are your things to say and it's not </v>

2125
01:59:52.920 --> 01:59:54.280
<v Speaker 1>necessarily that easy to figure out what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are.</v>

2126
01:59:54.281 --> 01:59:59.281
<v Speaker 1>But as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you did a fine job of that when you </v>

2127
01:59:59.281 --> 01:59:59.281
<v Speaker 1>asked the question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think,</v>

2128
01:59:59.281 --> 02:00:01.270
<v Speaker 1>I think as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you already know what to do.</v>

2129
02:00:01.570 --> 02:00:03.670
<v Speaker 1>So good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do it.</v>

2130
02:00:03.820 --> 02:00:06.070
<v Speaker 1>Read everything great you can get your </v>
<v Speaker 1>damn hands on.</v>

2131
02:00:13.130 --> 02:00:14.540
<v Speaker 5>Hello.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dr Peterson.</v>

2132
02:00:15.500 --> 02:00:20.500
<v Speaker 5>So a lot of your work,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of your lectures recommend the </v>

2133
02:00:20.811 --> 02:00:25.100
<v Speaker 5>audience tackle life with a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 5>attention and intention.</v>

2134
02:00:26.030 --> 02:00:26.960
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2135
02:00:27.380 --> 02:00:30.770
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in my kind of personal gateway,</v>

2136
02:00:30.771 --> 02:00:34.700
<v Speaker 5>drug to philosophy has been more eastern</v>
<v Speaker 5>philosophy and,</v>

2137
02:00:34.701 --> 02:00:39.701
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the Bhagavad Gita and the work of </v>

2138
02:00:39.701 --> 02:00:43.541
<v Speaker 5>Alan Watts and a tower [inaudible] and </v>
<v Speaker 5>what I noticed,</v>

2139
02:00:45.920 --> 02:00:50.920
<v Speaker 5>I may be wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but this is a common theme in eastern </v>

2140
02:00:50.920 --> 02:00:52.910
<v Speaker 5>philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is more passive non-action.</v>

2141
02:00:53.180 --> 02:00:56.570
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't make as many plans.</v>

2142
02:00:56.690 --> 02:00:58.080
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2143
02:00:58.081 --> 02:01:03.081
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wonder how you reconcile that and how </v>

2144
02:01:03.081 --> 02:01:07.001
<v Speaker 5>you are reconciling that because you </v>
<v Speaker 5>mentioned earlier in previous lectures </v>

2145
02:01:07.001 --> 02:01:10.691
<v Speaker 5>that you've read the teaching.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How do you reconcile those two different</v>

2146
02:01:10.761 --> 02:01:11.300
<v Speaker 5>views?</v>

2147
02:01:14.720 --> 02:01:19.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think first that the Dao de Jing in </v>

2148
02:01:19.720 --> 02:01:23.051
<v Speaker 1>particular reason about inaction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about minimal proper action and </v>

2149
02:01:23.330 --> 02:01:28.330
<v Speaker 1>it's also about minimal proper action </v>
<v Speaker 1>after a tremendous amount of sacrifice.</v>

2150
02:01:29.960 --> 02:01:34.960
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the sage that speaking forth in the </v>

2151
02:01:34.960 --> 02:01:38.860
<v Speaker 1>Tao Te Ching has already let go of </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost everything that he needs to let </v>

2152
02:01:38.860 --> 02:01:42.821
<v Speaker 1>go off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a tremendous amount of what you're </v>

2153
02:01:42.821 --> 02:01:44.360
<v Speaker 1>reading in the eastern philosophies is </v>
<v Speaker 1>predicated,</v>

2154
02:01:44.361 --> 02:01:49.361
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in part on the idea of </v>

2155
02:01:49.361 --> 02:01:51.311
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of things that you're </v>

2156
02:01:51.311 --> 02:01:53.801
<v Speaker 1>grabbing onto like the monkey with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>jar that's actually causing your misery.</v>

2157
02:01:55.040 --> 02:01:58.370
<v Speaker 1>And so sometimes letting go is the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>way of moving ahead,</v>

2158
02:01:58.371 --> 02:02:01.310
<v Speaker 1>but to me that ties into this idea of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice.</v>

2159
02:02:02.030 --> 02:02:07.030
<v Speaker 1>So now whether there's more than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether there's more intentionality in </v>

2160
02:02:07.281 --> 02:02:10.070
<v Speaker 1>western philosophy and less </v>
<v Speaker 1>intentionality in eastern philosophy,</v>

2161
02:02:10.071 --> 02:02:15.071
<v Speaker 1>I'm not exactly sure one way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mediating between those two was </v>

2162
02:02:15.950 --> 02:02:20.950
<v Speaker 1>formulated at least in part by Carl </v>
<v Speaker 1>young and he pointed out that the </v>

2163
02:02:21.021 --> 02:02:24.710
<v Speaker 1>archetypal figure for the West died at </v>
<v Speaker 1>32.</v>

2164
02:02:25.370 --> 02:02:30.370
<v Speaker 1>And so to some degree that outgoing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extroverted,</v>

2165
02:02:30.741 --> 02:02:35.741
<v Speaker 1>let's say nature of the West is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of its youthfulness in some </v>

2166
02:02:37.551 --> 02:02:42.551
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's useful ethos and that the east </v>

2167
02:02:42.780 --> 02:02:47.780
<v Speaker 1>Buddha died at a fairly ripe old age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even in the Hindu practices,</v>

2168
02:02:48.310 --> 02:02:51.440
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were many Hindu temples.</v>

2169
02:02:51.441 --> 02:02:54.380
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of erotic sculptures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea,</v>

2170
02:02:54.420 --> 02:02:57.620
<v Speaker 1>something like if you can't get past the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dam erotic sculptures,</v>

2171
02:02:57.621 --> 02:03:00.860
<v Speaker 1>it's not time to go into the temple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's more than that.</v>

2172
02:03:00.861 --> 02:03:05.861
<v Speaker 1>It might also be that if you're young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not time to get past the erotic </v>

2173
02:03:05.861 --> 02:03:09.551
<v Speaker 1>sculptures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe maybe there's a moving forward </v>

2174
02:03:09.551 --> 02:03:13.781
<v Speaker 1>into life in youth and a letting go in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the latter part of life.</v>

2175
02:03:14.960 --> 02:03:16.520
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2176
02:03:16.521 --> 02:03:20.450
<v Speaker 1>that was [inaudible] way of mediating </v>
<v Speaker 1>between those two traditions.</v>

2177
02:03:20.660 --> 02:03:24.800
<v Speaker 1>I think they're tightly aligned with </v>
<v Speaker 1>regards to the importance of sacrifice.</v>

2178
02:03:25.420 --> 02:03:29.630
<v Speaker 1>It frequently is the case that it's your</v>
<v Speaker 1>desire mile,</v>

2179
02:03:29.631 --> 02:03:34.631
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your desire that's causing your </v>

2180
02:03:34.631 --> 02:03:34.631
<v Speaker 1>suffering.</v>

2181
02:03:34.631 --> 02:03:36.650
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's an emphasis in Buddhism,</v>

2182
02:03:36.920 --> 02:03:40.310
<v Speaker 1>even more than endowed with some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say on letting go,</v>

2183
02:03:41.090 --> 02:03:43.220
<v Speaker 1>letting go of what's making you </v>
<v Speaker 1>miserable.</v>

2184
02:03:43.940 --> 02:03:48.940
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you remember the thing about Buddha </v>

2185
02:03:48.940 --> 02:03:49.940
<v Speaker 1>is that he got enlightened under the bow</v>
<v Speaker 1>tree,</v>

2186
02:03:49.941 --> 02:03:54.941
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He basically stepped into the city of </v>

2187
02:03:54.941 --> 02:03:59.261
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He stepped into Nirvana and he could </v>

2188
02:03:59.261 --> 02:04:02.711
<v Speaker 1>have stayed there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he chose to come back because he </v>

2189
02:04:02.711 --> 02:04:06.941
<v Speaker 1>decided that he had a responsibility to </v>
<v Speaker 1>rectify suffering in the rest of the </v>

2190
02:04:07.791 --> 02:04:11.270
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That it was not sufficient for him to be</v>

2191
02:04:11.450 --> 02:04:13.010
<v Speaker 1>enlightened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2192
02:04:13.011 --> 02:04:18.011
<v Speaker 1>everything else was left in a state of </v>
<v Speaker 1>insufficiency and suffering.</v>

2193
02:04:18.530 --> 02:04:21.590
<v Speaker 1>And so I wouldn't call that inaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2194
02:04:23.060 --> 02:04:23.710
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2195
02:04:23.990 --> 02:04:27.650
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've made the mistake myself.</v>

2196
02:04:27.680 --> 02:04:31.580
<v Speaker 1>It's inaction versus non-action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually had to look up.</v>

2197
02:04:31.581 --> 02:04:32.990
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>

2198
02:04:33.020 --> 02:04:38.020
<v Speaker 1>That's well not to read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Dao de Jing does a very good job of </v>

2199
02:04:38.020 --> 02:04:42.050
<v Speaker 1>distinguishing between those two because</v>
<v Speaker 1>non-action is the minimal necessary </v>

2200
02:04:42.571 --> 02:04:47.571
<v Speaker 1>action to keep the balance between order</v>
<v Speaker 1>and chaos proper,</v>

2201
02:04:47.700 --> 02:04:48.030
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2202
02:04:48.060 --> 02:04:51.180
<v Speaker 1>That the end in the egg and the Tao Te </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ching is very,</v>

2203
02:04:51.181 --> 02:04:56.181
<v Speaker 1>very emphatic about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You detach and you watch and when it's </v>

2204
02:04:58.531 --> 02:05:02.880
<v Speaker 1>time to intervene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you intervene minimally without a lot of</v>

2205
02:05:03.030 --> 02:05:08.030
<v Speaker 1>arrogant self propagandized nation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you tap and if you do that properly,</v>

2206
02:05:09.661 --> 02:05:12.930
<v Speaker 1>you hardly have to do it at all and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>says if you're doing nothing,</v>

2207
02:05:13.660 --> 02:05:16.800
<v Speaker 1>and there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's great wisdom in that book.</v>

2208
02:05:17.100 --> 02:05:18.840
<v Speaker 1>I really liked the Tao Te Ching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2209
02:05:19.170 --> 02:05:24.170
<v Speaker 1>it's a remarkable document and I've seen</v>
<v Speaker 1>managers who were like that who were </v>

2210
02:05:24.901 --> 02:05:29.901
<v Speaker 1>really good at running their company who</v>
<v Speaker 1>did nothing but what they did well,</v>

2211
02:05:30.570 --> 02:05:35.570
<v Speaker 1>but first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they set up people to replace them </v>

2212
02:05:35.570 --> 02:05:36.120
<v Speaker 1>because their idea was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2213
02:05:36.121 --> 02:05:38.700
<v Speaker 1>if I'm a really good manager then this </v>
<v Speaker 1>place could run without me.</v>

2214
02:05:39.210 --> 02:05:44.210
<v Speaker 1>There's a real humility in that and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just kind of wandered around the </v>

2215
02:05:44.210 --> 02:05:47.130
<v Speaker 1>place talking to people and if there was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bit of a problem then they just,</v>

2216
02:05:47.160 --> 02:05:52.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turn to norb 10th of a degree and the </v>

2217
02:05:52.321 --> 02:05:57.321
<v Speaker 1>place ran smoothly and it was as if they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were doing nothing and what they were </v>

2218
02:05:57.321 --> 02:06:00.771
<v Speaker 1>doing was detaching so they weren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>being buried by their current concerns.</v>

2219
02:06:01.650 --> 02:06:06.650
<v Speaker 1>They were watching to see what was going</v>
<v Speaker 1>on and then they were minimally </v>

2220
02:06:06.930 --> 02:06:10.350
<v Speaker 1>interacting and that worked like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>charm.</v>

2221
02:06:10.710 --> 02:06:15.710
<v Speaker 1>So I think that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like the idea that all religious</v>

2222
02:06:16.291 --> 02:06:19.740
<v Speaker 1>traditions are the same because that </v>
<v Speaker 1>just makes them into like a gray mass,</v>

2223
02:06:20.070 --> 02:06:25.070
<v Speaker 1>but I don't see that there's any </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference there that can't be bridged.</v>

2224
02:06:25.320 --> 02:06:28.920
<v Speaker 1>I think as you look into the details,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bridges become more clear.</v>

2225
02:06:39.820 --> 02:06:41.830
<v Speaker 1>I'll get you to speak into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>microphone,</v>

2226
02:06:41.860 --> 02:06:44.080
<v Speaker 1>especially when you're saying self </v>
<v Speaker 1>deprecating thing.</v>

2227
02:06:46.180 --> 02:06:47.830
<v Speaker 1>Let everybody hear you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2228
02:06:50.990 --> 02:06:54.670
<v Speaker 1>It's my pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's happened?</v>

2229
02:06:54.730 --> 02:06:58.400
<v Speaker 1>What's happened to you as a consequence?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2230
02:06:59.850 --> 02:07:02.410
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you seeing it that way anyways?</v>

2231
02:07:02.950 --> 02:07:04.030
<v Speaker 1>Well mainly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2232
02:07:04.480 --> 02:07:06.250
<v Speaker 1>I've had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had whatever you say,</v>

2233
02:07:06.310 --> 02:07:11.310
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is something I've thought but not have </v>

2234
02:07:11.310 --> 02:07:11.310
<v Speaker 1>been able to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2235
02:07:11.310 --> 02:07:11.310
<v Speaker 1>articulate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2236
02:07:11.310 --> 02:07:15.481
<v Speaker 1>So it's been very helpful in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>regards and kind of saves me a lot of </v>

2237
02:07:15.481 --> 02:07:15.481
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2238
02:07:15.481 --> 02:07:15.580
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good,</v>

2239
02:07:15.730 --> 02:07:16.360
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

2240
02:07:16.690 --> 02:07:17.730
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2241
02:07:17.840 --> 02:07:19.390
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my main question is actually,</v>

2242
02:07:19.391 --> 02:07:24.391
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something you said a couple of lectures </v>

2243
02:07:24.391 --> 02:07:25.741
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was something along the lines of a </v>

2244
02:07:25.741 --> 02:07:28.110
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

2245
02:07:28.280 --> 02:07:29.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

2246
02:07:29.970 --> 02:07:32.110
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the history of your family,</v>

2247
02:07:32.410 --> 02:07:34.160
<v Speaker 1>kind of like the sins of your family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

2248
02:07:34.170 --> 02:07:35.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are,</v>

2249
02:07:35.650 --> 02:07:37.580
<v Speaker 1>you're facing it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

2250
02:07:37.810 --> 02:07:40.450
<v Speaker 1>What's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you expand on that more?</v>

2251
02:07:44.110 --> 02:07:49.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this idea in the old testament </v>

2252
02:07:49.110 --> 02:07:51.031
<v Speaker 1>that your sins might be visited onto </v>
<v Speaker 1>your family seven generations down.</v>

2253
02:07:52.600 --> 02:07:55.610
<v Speaker 1>Seems kind of harsh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

2254
02:07:56.230 --> 02:07:58.930
<v Speaker 1>when you're confronting maybe your </v>
<v Speaker 1>father's tyrannical.</v>

2255
02:08:00.040 --> 02:08:00.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

2256
02:08:00.791 --> 02:08:05.791
<v Speaker 1>maybe his father beat the hell out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>him and maybe his father's father was a </v>

2257
02:08:05.791 --> 02:08:09.670
<v Speaker 1>vicious alcoholic and he just bloody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well don't know how far back that goes.</v>

2258
02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:15.000
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that means also you don't exactly </v>

2259
02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:15.000
<v Speaker 1>know what you're dealing with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2260
02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:16.600
<v Speaker 1>To some degree you're dealing with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>father,</v>

2261
02:08:16.601 --> 02:08:20.740
<v Speaker 1>but only partly what you're dealing with</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the pathological paternal spirit,</v>

2262
02:08:20.950 --> 02:08:25.950
<v Speaker 1>something like that and that it's better</v>
<v Speaker 1>to think about that way because it </v>

2263
02:08:25.950 --> 02:08:26.230
<v Speaker 1>becomes an existential issue at that </v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

2264
02:08:26.740 --> 02:08:31.740
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you could say that while the father </v>

2265
02:08:31.740 --> 02:08:34.381
<v Speaker 1>has two components,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I mean this psychologically </v>

2266
02:08:34.381 --> 02:08:37.231
<v Speaker 1>speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the great father that's </v>

2267
02:08:37.231 --> 02:08:39.090
<v Speaker 1>beneficial and protective that organize </v>
<v Speaker 1>the society and teaches you how to speak</v>

2268
02:08:39.191 --> 02:08:41.170
<v Speaker 1>and has produced all these wonderful </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

2269
02:08:41.171 --> 02:08:44.740
<v Speaker 1>and then there's the tyrannical </v>
<v Speaker 1>oppressive part of the father,</v>

2270
02:08:45.310 --> 02:08:49.000
<v Speaker 1>just like there's the terrible part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother nature that's destructive and the</v>

2271
02:08:49.001 --> 02:08:54.001
<v Speaker 1>benevolent part of Mother Nature that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>wonderful and productive and you're </v>

2272
02:08:54.001 --> 02:08:54.460
<v Speaker 1>stuck with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2273
02:08:54.790 --> 02:08:58.510
<v Speaker 1>You're stuck with having to mediate </v>
<v Speaker 1>between those opposing forces,</v>

2274
02:08:58.511 --> 02:09:03.511
<v Speaker 1>just like you're stuck with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>adversarial part of yourself in the </v>

2275
02:09:03.511 --> 02:09:04.990
<v Speaker 1>heroic part of yourself and it's up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you to set those things right.</v>

2276
02:09:05.980 --> 02:09:09.370
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise they propagate into the future</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it isn't.</v>

2277
02:09:09.371 --> 02:09:11.770
<v Speaker 1>It's a straightforward thing to say how </v>
<v Speaker 1>to set them.</v>

2278
02:09:11.771 --> 02:09:14.380
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's quite a good movie about that.</v>

2279
02:09:16.560 --> 02:09:18.150
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't be Magnolia,</v>

2280
02:09:19.590 --> 02:09:21.630
<v Speaker 1>which I really love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's by Paul Anderson,</v>

2281
02:09:21.631 --> 02:09:23.700
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope that's right.</v>

2282
02:09:23.940 --> 02:09:27.090
<v Speaker 1>A beautiful movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's about this part of.</v>

2283
02:09:27.091 --> 02:09:31.080
<v Speaker 1>It's about this kid whose fathers really</v>
<v Speaker 1>pushing them to be a superstar at a,</v>

2284
02:09:31.530 --> 02:09:32.640
<v Speaker 1>at a Quistio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2285
02:09:32.641 --> 02:09:33.750
<v Speaker 1>He's a genius kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2286
02:09:34.520 --> 02:09:34.990
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

2287
02:09:36.970 --> 02:09:39.070
<v Speaker 1>the kids studies this guy named Charles </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sport.</v>

2288
02:09:39.130 --> 02:09:44.130
<v Speaker 1>You don't understand this movie if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know this because you've got to </v>

2289
02:09:44.130 --> 02:09:44.130
<v Speaker 1>know about Charles fort to understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>magnolia.</v>

2290
02:09:44.130 --> 02:09:48.570
<v Speaker 1>Charles for was this weird old guy who </v>
<v Speaker 1>got rich with an inheritance when he was</v>

2291
02:09:48.760 --> 02:09:53.760
<v Speaker 1>20 and spent the rest of his life in </v>
<v Speaker 1>libraries looking up impossible things </v>

2292
02:09:53.760 --> 02:09:57.721
<v Speaker 1>and documenting them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Impossible things that couldn't happen </v>

2293
02:09:57.721 --> 02:10:01.261
<v Speaker 1>from a scientific perspective that we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>well attested to by multiple observers </v>

2294
02:10:01.261 --> 02:10:03.550
<v Speaker 1>and he produced this news paper called </v>
<v Speaker 1>the 14 times,</v>

2295
02:10:03.551 --> 02:10:08.551
<v Speaker 1>which still runs anyways in Magnolia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Magnolia begins with this guy who falls </v>

2296
02:10:09.521 --> 02:10:14.521
<v Speaker 1>out of a building and then it's shot by </v>
<v Speaker 1>a woman who misses her husband with a </v>

2297
02:10:14.521 --> 02:10:15.370
<v Speaker 1>rifle as he falls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think she's.</v>

2298
02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:21.000
<v Speaker 1>She's charged with murder and the street</v>
<v Speaker 1>names have something to do with the </v>

2299
02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:22.000
<v Speaker 1>death sentence fall and all of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened,</v>

2300
02:10:22.001 --> 02:10:27.001
<v Speaker 1>and then in the movie there's a rain of </v>
<v Speaker 1>frogs and there are rains of frogs from </v>

2301
02:10:27.641 --> 02:10:28.120
<v Speaker 1>time to time.</v>

2302
02:10:28.120 --> 02:10:30.610
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they're frozen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes their reins of fish.</v>

2303
02:10:30.611 --> 02:10:31.900
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they're frozen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2304
02:10:31.901 --> 02:10:33.530
<v Speaker 1>what the hell?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does that happen?</v>

2305
02:10:33.730 --> 02:10:35.510
<v Speaker 1>Happens quite frequently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As it turns out,</v>

2306
02:10:35.750 --> 02:10:40.750
<v Speaker 1>there's a rain of frogs in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the movie magnolia and this little </v>

2307
02:10:40.750 --> 02:10:45.611
<v Speaker 1>kid see what happened to him is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's on stage and he ends up peeing his </v>

2308
02:10:46.551 --> 02:10:51.551
<v Speaker 1>pants because of the pressure basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>and humiliates himself and then there's </v>

2309
02:10:52.191 --> 02:10:57.191
<v Speaker 1>this reign of frogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which he kind of takes us a sign from </v>

2310
02:10:57.191 --> 02:10:59.090
<v Speaker 1>God and then he goes to his father even </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like eight years old,</v>

2311
02:10:59.091 --> 02:11:00.020
<v Speaker 1>this kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he says,</v>

2312
02:11:01.220 --> 02:11:04.430
<v Speaker 1>you have to stop doing this to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And He's dead serious about it.</v>

2313
02:11:04.431 --> 02:11:06.740
<v Speaker 1>Very careful not being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2314
02:11:07.220 --> 02:11:09.290
<v Speaker 1>what would you call insubordinate?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing like that.</v>

2315
02:11:09.890 --> 02:11:14.890
<v Speaker 1>He decides that that's coming to an end </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now and you have to make those </v>

2316
02:11:14.890 --> 02:11:19.751
<v Speaker 1>decisions in your family because </v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise things propagate down the </v>

2317
02:11:19.751 --> 02:11:19.751
<v Speaker 1>generations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

2318
02:11:19.751 --> 02:11:23.621
<v Speaker 1>and every family is rife with </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathologies of one form or another and </v>

2319
02:11:23.621 --> 02:11:28.030
<v Speaker 1>you can learn from that and refuse to </v>
<v Speaker 1>push it forward and that's part of I </v>

2320
02:11:28.401 --> 02:11:30.440
<v Speaker 1>think what you do when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

2321
02:11:31.900 --> 02:11:36.900
<v Speaker 1>when you shoulder your existential </v>
<v Speaker 1>burden because everyone is the </v>

2322
02:11:36.900 --> 02:11:39.160
<v Speaker 1>beneficiary and the victim of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tyrannical father,</v>

2323
02:11:39.700 --> 02:11:44.700
<v Speaker 1>just like everyone is the beneficiary </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the victim of mother nature and of </v>

2324
02:11:44.700 --> 02:11:48.061
<v Speaker 1>themselves and so you lock horns without</v>
<v Speaker 1>and straighten it out one way or another</v>

2325
02:11:48.430 --> 02:11:50.890
<v Speaker 1>and you don't move it forward to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>next generation.</v>

2326
02:11:51.730 --> 02:11:55.990
<v Speaker 1>So and maybe you detach it a bit from </v>
<v Speaker 1>your parents too because</v>

2327
02:11:57.440 --> 02:12:02.440
<v Speaker 1>God only knows what combination of </v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophes culminated in their </v>

2328
02:12:02.690 --> 02:12:07.690
<v Speaker 1>particular forms of pathology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So good enough.</v>

2329
02:12:18.030 --> 02:12:23.030
<v Speaker 6>So this week we've had the google thing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there was the youtube thing that </v>

2330
02:12:23.030 --> 02:12:26.910
<v Speaker 6>happened last week.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What's going on with censorship and what</v>

2331
02:12:26.911 --> 02:12:27.810
<v Speaker 6>should people do about it?</v>

2332
02:12:29.240 --> 02:12:31.220
<v Speaker 1>If you're in a workplace in </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathological,</v>

2333
02:12:31.221 --> 02:12:33.110
<v Speaker 1>things are happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is easy.</v>

2334
02:12:33.111 --> 02:12:38.111
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you how you know of </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathological things are happening at </v>

2335
02:12:38.111 --> 02:12:39.680
<v Speaker 1>your workplace or they're happening with</v>
<v Speaker 1>you one of the two,</v>

2336
02:12:39.681 --> 02:12:44.681
<v Speaker 1>but you can straighten that out if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're being required to do things that </v>

2337
02:12:46.301 --> 02:12:51.040
<v Speaker 1>make you weak and ashamed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then stop.</v>

2338
02:12:52.200 --> 02:12:57.200
<v Speaker 1>Don't do them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like one of the things I learned from </v>

2339
02:12:57.200 --> 02:13:00.750
<v Speaker 1>Solzhenitsyn and Frankl was that</v>

2340
02:13:01.920 --> 02:13:06.920
<v Speaker 1>systems go terribly under,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of control when people don't stop </v>

2341
02:13:06.920 --> 02:13:11.241
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're going mildly out of </v>

2342
02:13:11.241 --> 02:13:11.241
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know when you might say,</v>

2343
02:13:11.241 --> 02:13:13.470
<v Speaker 1>I should just keep my goddamn head down </v>
<v Speaker 1>and shut up.</v>

2344
02:13:13.500 --> 02:13:15.990
<v Speaker 1>It's like maybe you should like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not bad advice.</v>

2345
02:13:16.700 --> 02:13:21.700
<v Speaker 1>You know you don't want to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>unnecessary enemies and you don't need </v>

2346
02:13:21.700 --> 02:13:25.041
<v Speaker 1>any more trouble than you need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you got to ask yourself on a day to </v>

2347
02:13:25.041 --> 02:13:26.700
<v Speaker 1>day basis what makes you think you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not selling your soul.</v>

2348
02:13:27.810 --> 02:13:31.230
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's so much foolishness going on</v>

2349
02:13:31.231 --> 02:13:35.460
<v Speaker 1>in the mid level bureaucratic world now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where all the tyranny seems to be</v>

2350
02:13:35.461 --> 02:13:40.461
<v Speaker 1>focused and the reason that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>multiplies is because sensible people </v>

2351
02:13:40.711 --> 02:13:44.220
<v Speaker 1>say nothing when they should say </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

2352
02:13:44.221 --> 02:13:49.221
<v Speaker 1>And what's so strange about that is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are way more sensible people than </v>

2353
02:13:49.410 --> 02:13:52.170
<v Speaker 1>people who aren't sensible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just not as noisy.</v>

2354
02:13:52.650 --> 02:13:54.760
<v Speaker 1>So what you'll turn out if like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2355
02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:57.690
<v Speaker 1>so let's say something's bugging the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hell out of you at work.</v>

2356
02:13:57.930 --> 02:14:00.420
<v Speaker 1>Well then you have to prepare it to find</v>
<v Speaker 1>another job.</v>

2357
02:14:00.450 --> 02:14:05.450
<v Speaker 1>That's the first thing you have to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that you should find </v>

2358
02:14:05.450 --> 02:14:09.201
<v Speaker 1>another job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you should prepare to find another </v>

2359
02:14:09.201 --> 02:14:12.231
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if possible you should prepare to </v>

2360
02:14:12.231 --> 02:14:14.661
<v Speaker 1>find a better job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you can't tell someone to go </v>

2361
02:14:14.661 --> 02:14:14.910
<v Speaker 1>to hale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can't negotiate with them.</v>

2362
02:14:15.180 --> 02:14:17.580
<v Speaker 1>And if and if they've got you over a </v>
<v Speaker 1>barrel,</v>

2363
02:14:17.581 --> 02:14:19.740
<v Speaker 1>then you can't say anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you gotTa,</v>

2364
02:14:19.890 --> 02:14:22.530
<v Speaker 1>you gotta set yourself up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've got some mobility and actually</v>

2365
02:14:22.531 --> 02:14:24.180
<v Speaker 1>that's a really good principal in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

2366
02:14:24.181 --> 02:14:29.181
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should set yourself up so that you </v>

2367
02:14:29.181 --> 02:14:30.810
<v Speaker 1>have a lateral move at hand and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>should find out,</v>

2368
02:14:30.811 --> 02:14:35.811
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are there things at work that are </v>

2369
02:14:35.811 --> 02:14:35.811
<v Speaker 1>disturbing my soul?</v>

2370
02:14:35.811 --> 02:14:35.970
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you find that out.</v>

2371
02:14:36.030 --> 02:14:37.230
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you ask yourself,</v>

2372
02:14:37.231 --> 02:14:38.280
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm disturbed at work.</v>

2373
02:14:38.281 --> 02:14:43.281
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm probably week and deceitful and </v>

2374
02:14:43.281 --> 02:14:45.981
<v Speaker 1>useless and lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might as well start with that and </v>

2375
02:14:45.981 --> 02:14:46.770
<v Speaker 1>then you talk to some people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like your wife,</v>

2376
02:14:46.771 --> 02:14:48.300
<v Speaker 1>your friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your coworkers,</v>

2377
02:14:48.301 --> 02:14:51.450
<v Speaker 1>and find out are you stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deceitful and lazy,</v>

2378
02:14:51.750 --> 02:14:53.970
<v Speaker 1>or is there something not so good going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on at work?</v>

2379
02:14:53.971 --> 02:14:58.971
<v Speaker 1>And so if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can then eliminate your own </v>

2380
02:14:58.971 --> 02:14:59.700
<v Speaker 1>personal pathology as a cause of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>dissatisfaction,</v>

2381
02:15:00.090 --> 02:15:05.090
<v Speaker 1>then maybe there's something rotten in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the state of Denmark and maybe you </v>

2382
02:15:05.090 --> 02:15:08.961
<v Speaker 1>should say something about it before the</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole goddamn thing collapses because </v>

2383
02:15:08.961 --> 02:15:13.010
<v Speaker 1>that can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can happen in companies a lot faster </v>

2384
02:15:13.010 --> 02:15:13.950
<v Speaker 1>than people ever think you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you may find that,</v>

2385
02:15:14.070 --> 02:15:14.700
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

2386
02:15:14.701 --> 02:15:16.740
<v Speaker 1>you may find if you say something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well first of all,</v>

2387
02:15:16.741 --> 02:15:17.580
<v Speaker 1>that's an adventure.</v>

2388
02:15:17.580 --> 02:15:22.580
<v Speaker 1>That's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a bloody adventure and you have </v>

2389
02:15:22.580 --> 02:15:23.130
<v Speaker 1>to do it carefully and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you have to be prepared for it,</v>

2390
02:15:23.220 --> 02:15:25.080
<v Speaker 1>but it might be the best thing that ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened to you.</v>

2391
02:15:25.680 --> 02:15:27.660
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing is if you're careful</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>

2392
02:15:27.661 --> 02:15:29.560
<v Speaker 1>you get your words right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like in,</v>

2393
02:15:29.561 --> 02:15:31.950
<v Speaker 1>this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is strategic battle,</v>

2394
02:15:31.951 --> 02:15:36.951
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not something you wander into </v>

2395
02:15:36.951 --> 02:15:38.301
<v Speaker 1>carelessly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you may find that there's lots of </v>

2396
02:15:38.301 --> 02:15:41.061
<v Speaker 1>people who feel exactly the same way you</v>
<v Speaker 1>do and that you've actually caught and </v>

2397
02:15:41.061 --> 02:15:44.331
<v Speaker 1>onto something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a canary in a coal mine and not </v>

2398
02:15:44.331 --> 02:15:47.091
<v Speaker 1>just some psychopathic mouthpiece,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you got to ask yourself,</v>

2399
02:15:47.671 --> 02:15:50.340
<v Speaker 1>when you go and do what you do like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this making you stronger?</v>

2400
02:15:50.341 --> 02:15:53.100
<v Speaker 1>Is this making you weaker?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if it's making you weaker,</v>

2401
02:15:53.370 --> 02:15:56.310
<v Speaker 1>then you gotta ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you really want to be weaker?</v>

2402
02:15:56.640 --> 02:16:01.640
<v Speaker 1>Because the weaker you get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more your tyrannized and then worse </v>

2403
02:16:01.640 --> 02:16:01.640
<v Speaker 1>than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the weaker you get,</v>

2404
02:16:01.640 --> 02:16:04.860
<v Speaker 1>the more bitter you get and the more </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll work towards terrible things.</v>

2405
02:16:04.860 --> 02:16:07.620
<v Speaker 1>The more you'll snap it your wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more you'll kick your kids.</v>

2406
02:16:07.621 --> 02:16:12.621
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's no joke to be tyrannized at </v>

2407
02:16:12.621 --> 02:16:15.411
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say you have an ethical </v>

2408
02:16:15.411 --> 02:16:18.471
<v Speaker 1>responsibility as a citizen to </v>
<v Speaker 1>forthrightly confront,</v>

2409
02:16:18.930 --> 02:16:22.200
<v Speaker 1>creeping tyranny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter where it occurs.</v>

2410
02:16:22.530 --> 02:16:25.320
<v Speaker 1>And part of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of what we're learning,</v>

2411
02:16:25.321 --> 02:16:28.380
<v Speaker 1>I would say from these stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we're learning anything at all,</v>

2412
02:16:28.381 --> 02:16:33.381
<v Speaker 1>is that if you're aimed at the good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a question you really got to </v>

2413
02:16:33.641 --> 02:16:34.720
<v Speaker 1>ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2414
02:16:35.140 --> 02:16:40.140
<v Speaker 1>if you're genuinely aimed at the good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then take heart because you're a lot </v>

2415
02:16:40.140 --> 02:16:42.430
<v Speaker 1>stronger than you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

2416
02:16:43.850 --> 02:16:45.790
<v Speaker 6>I have a followup question,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Kate.</v>

2417
02:16:46.010 --> 02:16:51.010
<v Speaker 6>So I'm speaking to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's lots of people who were in this </v>

2418
02:16:51.010 --> 02:16:51.010
<v Speaker 6>situation like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2419
02:16:51.010 --> 02:16:53.180
<v Speaker 6>people at universities and corporations </v>
<v Speaker 6>all over the place.</v>

2420
02:16:53.190 --> 02:16:58.190
<v Speaker 6>I know Google is not the only company </v>
<v Speaker 6>that is not the worst repressive freedom</v>

2421
02:17:01.101 --> 02:17:05.600
<v Speaker 6>of speech denying workplace codes and </v>
<v Speaker 6>everybody feels alone,</v>

2422
02:17:07.500 --> 02:17:08.490
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're all like,</v>

2423
02:17:08.730 --> 02:17:11.370
<v Speaker 6>why should I stand up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>be a martyr,</v>

2424
02:17:11.580 --> 02:17:13.590
<v Speaker 6>get fired.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This guy at Google got fired.</v>

2425
02:17:13.610 --> 02:17:15.600
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What's the point?</v>

2426
02:17:18.500 --> 02:17:19.970
<v Speaker 6>I'm asking rhetorically.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2427
02:17:20.770 --> 02:17:22.560
<v Speaker 6>it's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And how do you.</v>

2428
02:17:23.040 --> 02:17:28.040
<v Speaker 6>How do you convince people that there's </v>
<v Speaker 6>a point to standing up when it appears </v>

2429
02:17:28.040 --> 02:17:28.290
<v Speaker 6>to be futile?</v>

2430
02:17:30.280 --> 02:17:35.280
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing I think is you convince </v>

2431
02:17:35.280 --> 02:17:35.620
<v Speaker 1>them that it's not futile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be difficult,</v>

2432
02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:40.540
<v Speaker 1>but it's not futile if you get your </v>
<v Speaker 1>words right,</v>

2433
02:17:40.960 --> 02:17:44.200
<v Speaker 1>you have something to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There'll be an impact of those words.</v>

2434
02:17:44.550 --> 02:17:46.600
<v Speaker 1>It might not be the impact that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>would choose,</v>

2435
02:17:46.800 --> 02:17:51.800
<v Speaker 1>but the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the other thing you've got to tell </v>

2436
02:17:51.800 --> 02:17:52.660
<v Speaker 1>people is pick your poison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't.</v>

2437
02:17:52.720 --> 02:17:55.790
<v Speaker 1>You may be in a situation where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have a.</v>

2438
02:17:56.650 --> 02:17:59.170
<v Speaker 1>You don't have a cake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Walk to the garden of Paradise.</v>

2439
02:17:59.260 --> 02:18:02.470
<v Speaker 1>You got tyranny or famine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are your choices,</v>

2440
02:18:02.800 --> 02:18:06.010
<v Speaker 1>but you get to pick which one you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I would say if,</v>

2441
02:18:06.520 --> 02:18:11.520
<v Speaker 1>if you're being oppressed and I mean in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your soul by what you're required to </v>

2442
02:18:12.041 --> 02:18:15.790
<v Speaker 1>swallow at work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you think you're not paying a price</v>

2443
02:18:15.791 --> 02:18:19.130
<v Speaker 1>for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got no self respect and,</v>

2444
02:18:19.131 --> 02:18:19.630
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2445
02:18:19.650 --> 02:18:22.120
<v Speaker 1>and rightly so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but worse than that,</v>

2446
02:18:22.630 --> 02:18:24.940
<v Speaker 1>you're an agent of your own destruction.</v>

2447
02:18:25.450 --> 02:18:30.450
<v Speaker 1>You're destroying your own ideal and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're letting people who are weak and </v>

2448
02:18:30.450 --> 02:18:34.501
<v Speaker 1>corrupt when and if you stood up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stood up properly,</v>

2449
02:18:35.861 --> 02:18:37.780
<v Speaker 1>but you have to put yourself in order to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do this,</v>

2450
02:18:37.781 --> 02:18:38.980
<v Speaker 1>at least to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2451
02:18:38.981 --> 02:18:43.981
<v Speaker 1>You can't do it casually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to do it from some position of </v>

2452
02:18:43.981 --> 02:18:48.150
<v Speaker 1>preparedness and strength.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then what makes you think you couldn't </v>

2453
02:18:48.150 --> 02:18:51.370
<v Speaker 1>scare them back into the corners and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be a good thing.</v>

2454
02:18:52.180 --> 02:18:57.180
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the alternative personally is bad </v>

2455
02:18:57.180 --> 02:18:58.840
<v Speaker 1>because there's a psychological </v>
<v Speaker 1>degeneration that goes along with it.</v>

2456
02:18:58.841 --> 02:19:01.390
<v Speaker 1>I've seen this with many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of the people that I've worked with</v>

2457
02:19:01.690 --> 02:19:06.690
<v Speaker 1>who have been tyrannized in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>workplace to the absolute detriment of </v>

2458
02:19:06.690 --> 02:19:07.990
<v Speaker 1>their psychological and physical health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2459
02:19:08.320 --> 02:19:12.370
<v Speaker 1>To the point of collapse confronting </v>
<v Speaker 1>these crazy,</v>

2460
02:19:12.371 --> 02:19:14.500
<v Speaker 1>crazy things when they were sensible </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

2461
02:19:15.070 --> 02:19:17.620
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a terrible price to pay man.</v>

2462
02:19:17.830 --> 02:19:19.870
<v Speaker 1>Like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a bad price.</v>

2463
02:19:19.960 --> 02:19:24.960
<v Speaker 1>And then if the foolishness isn't dealt </v>
<v Speaker 1>with at the local level when it's still </v>

2464
02:19:27.080 --> 02:19:32.080
<v Speaker 1>relatively trivial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it will multiply until it's dealt </v>

2465
02:19:32.080 --> 02:19:33.770
<v Speaker 1>with at the social level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're seeing signs of that already.</v>

2466
02:19:33.870 --> 02:19:36.700
<v Speaker 1>ANTIFA is a good sign of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2467
02:19:36.701 --> 02:19:41.701
<v Speaker 1>and problems that aren't solved multiply</v>
<v Speaker 1>and soon people fight and you know,</v>

2468
02:19:42.560 --> 02:19:43.190
<v Speaker 1>edit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>argue,</v>

2469
02:19:43.191 --> 02:19:46.280
<v Speaker 1>then to fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you want to fight.</v>

2470
02:19:47.120 --> 02:19:49.820
<v Speaker 1>And some people want to fight and I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand why,</v>

2471
02:19:49.821 --> 02:19:51.410
<v Speaker 1>but I wouldn't recommend it because</v>

2472
02:19:57.000 --> 02:20:00.750
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't lead good places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really doesn't lead good places.</v>

2473
02:20:00.870 --> 02:20:02.550
<v Speaker 1>So I would say you have a duty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's,</v>

2474
02:20:02.610 --> 02:20:07.610
<v Speaker 1>that's where you stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because you have a goddamn duty to </v>

2475
02:20:07.610 --> 02:20:10.210
<v Speaker 1>stand up and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just say what you have to say it.</v>

2476
02:20:10.400 --> 02:20:12.570
<v Speaker 1>You don't even have to be trying to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>a point.</v>

2477
02:20:12.571 --> 02:20:14.160
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to get something done.</v>

2478
02:20:14.161 --> 02:20:16.740
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is how it looks to me.</v>

2479
02:20:16.741 --> 02:20:18.600
<v Speaker 1>That's what that guy had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Google did.</v>

2480
02:20:18.900 --> 02:20:21.390
<v Speaker 1>He wrote this memo and he said he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked to him today.</v>

2481
02:20:21.391 --> 02:20:21.930
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2482
02:20:22.080 --> 02:20:25.080
<v Speaker 1>he went to a diversity training seminar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he thought,</v>

2483
02:20:25.920 --> 02:20:28.050
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree with that.</v>

2484
02:20:28.290 --> 02:20:32.460
<v Speaker 1>And so then they asked for feedback.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we wrote this document a month ago.</v>

2485
02:20:32.461 --> 02:20:35.700
<v Speaker 1>This was written a month ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got No real response to it.</v>

2486
02:20:36.030 --> 02:20:41.030
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it bounced around inside Google until a </v>

2487
02:20:41.030 --> 02:20:42.420
<v Speaker 1>lot of people got interested in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It escaped into the outside world.</v>

2488
02:20:43.170 --> 02:20:48.170
<v Speaker 1>But all he was doing was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was told a bunch of things he didn't </v>

2489
02:20:48.170 --> 02:20:52.581
<v Speaker 1>think were true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wrote down a bunch of things he </v>

2490
02:20:52.581 --> 02:20:53.040
<v Speaker 1>thought were probably true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He launched it out and said,</v>

2491
02:20:53.041 --> 02:20:55.470
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think these things are probably true.</v>

2492
02:20:55.530 --> 02:20:56.340
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2493
02:20:58.190 --> 02:21:01.430
<v Speaker 1>probably their true well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he paid a price for it,</v>

2494
02:21:01.431 --> 02:21:03.470
<v Speaker 1>but maybe we'll see what sort of price </v>
<v Speaker 1>he paid for it.</v>

2495
02:21:03.471 --> 02:21:08.471
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be a lot tougher in two </v>

2496
02:21:08.471 --> 02:21:10.091
<v Speaker 1>years than he was two years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So new.</v>

2497
02:21:12.030 --> 02:21:13.910
<v Speaker 1>No one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't answer his feedback.</v>

2498
02:21:14.060 --> 02:21:15.770
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2499
02:21:15.830 --> 02:21:19.370
<v Speaker 1>but you can watch the video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stories there.</v>

2500
02:21:19.371 --> 02:21:21.020
<v Speaker 1>But that's kind of the outline of it.</v>

2501
02:21:21.810 --> 02:21:24.960
<v Speaker 6>So sorry to monopolize this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have one other question about this and</v>

2502
02:21:24.961 --> 02:21:29.961
<v Speaker 6>I think it's important,</v>
<v Speaker 6>aside from Google just being a </v>

2503
02:21:29.961 --> 02:21:30.120
<v Speaker 6>workplace,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2504
02:21:30.121 --> 02:21:32.760
<v Speaker 6>It also controls the own youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2505
02:21:33.200 --> 02:21:38.200
<v Speaker 6>Which is post a new censorship scheme </v>
<v Speaker 6>and it controls a huge amount of the </v>

2506
02:21:41.580 --> 02:21:46.580
<v Speaker 6>information that people get and so true </v>
<v Speaker 6>and so what happens to society when </v>

2507
02:21:49.880 --> 02:21:54.880
<v Speaker 6>companies such as Google,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which control our information start to </v>

2508
02:21:54.880 --> 02:21:59.240
<v Speaker 6>censor not just how about the selves and</v>
<v Speaker 6>maybe the information that's coming out </v>

2509
02:21:59.251 --> 02:22:04.251
<v Speaker 6>to the rest of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How much is this already happening and </v>

2510
02:22:04.251 --> 02:22:04.251
<v Speaker 6>how much.</v>

2511
02:22:04.700 --> 02:22:07.200
<v Speaker 1>What happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we refuse to find out,</v>

2512
02:22:08.160 --> 02:22:09.580
<v Speaker 1>that would be good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2513
02:22:09.581 --> 02:22:11.760
<v Speaker 1>like I reviewed this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy's document,</v>

2514
02:22:11.761 --> 02:22:16.761
<v Speaker 1>I did that yesterday and everything he </v>
<v Speaker 1>said was validated by the scientific </v>

2515
02:22:17.281 --> 02:22:20.520
<v Speaker 1>literature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what has happened is that someone has</v>

2516
02:22:20.521 --> 02:22:24.730
<v Speaker 1>been fired publicly by major corporation</v>
<v Speaker 1>for stating well,</v>

2517
02:22:25.470 --> 02:22:30.470
<v Speaker 1>scientific truths right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly the sorts of things that I say </v>

2518
02:22:30.470 --> 02:22:35.031
<v Speaker 1>in my classes for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason that I say to them is </v>

2519
02:22:35.031 --> 02:22:37.491
<v Speaker 1>because I read the literature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not because I'm personally happy </v>

2520
02:22:37.491 --> 02:22:40.881
<v Speaker 1>about the facts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Iq research particularly is so </v>

2521
02:22:40.881 --> 02:22:44.841
<v Speaker 1>dismal that you can't possibly read it </v>
<v Speaker 1>without being seriously disheartened if </v>

2522
02:22:44.841 --> 02:22:46.950
<v Speaker 1>I could reconstruct the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that ICU,</v>

2523
02:22:47.250 --> 02:22:50.490
<v Speaker 1>the ICU research wasn't true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2524
02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:52.740
<v Speaker 1>it sure be tempting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2525
02:22:53.370 --> 02:22:57.270
<v Speaker 1>but that's not how science works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Science doesn't tell you what you,</v>

2526
02:22:57.600 --> 02:23:00.210
<v Speaker 1>what you want to hear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just tells you the way it bloody well</v>

2527
02:23:00.211 --> 02:23:03.660
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he got pilloried for.</v>

2528
02:23:03.750 --> 02:23:08.750
<v Speaker 1>He got pilloried for revealing a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>fraction of current scientific knowledge</v>

2529
02:23:11.191 --> 02:23:12.960
<v Speaker 1>about gender differences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2530
02:23:13.230 --> 02:23:16.890
<v Speaker 1>That's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as you said,</v>

2531
02:23:16.920 --> 02:23:19.230
<v Speaker 1>that's a big company and it controls our</v>
<v Speaker 1>communication.</v>

2532
02:23:19.440 --> 02:23:24.440
<v Speaker 1>It's how about we do what we can to </v>
<v Speaker 1>ensure that these large communication </v>

2533
02:23:26.441 --> 02:23:29.290
<v Speaker 1>companies don't get to impose</v>

2534
02:23:29.620 --> 02:23:30.190
<v Speaker 3>a</v>

2535
02:23:31.950 --> 02:23:36.950
<v Speaker 1>factually false ideological structure on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the planet.</v>

2536
02:23:37.710 --> 02:23:41.220
<v Speaker 1>Or you can think about supporting this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy who blew the whistle,</v>

2537
02:23:41.221 --> 02:23:44.400
<v Speaker 1>there's a fundraiser for him online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could use some money.</v>

2538
02:23:44.490 --> 02:23:46.800
<v Speaker 1>He wants to sue google.</v>

2539
02:23:47.870 --> 02:23:52.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe we could.</v>

2540
02:23:54.550 --> 02:23:59.550
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we could let them know that hiring</v>
<v Speaker 1>a human resources director who's also </v>

2541
02:24:00.131 --> 02:24:04.390
<v Speaker 1>concerned with equity is probably not a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good idea for capitalist company.</v>

2542
02:24:04.870 --> 02:24:07.570
<v Speaker 1>Why in the world would you hire your own</v>
<v Speaker 1>enemies?</v>

2543
02:24:07.900 --> 02:24:12.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand that so well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll see how the dialogue continues,</v>

2544
02:24:12.851 --> 02:24:15.430
<v Speaker 1>but back to the personal like</v>

2545
02:24:16.630 --> 02:24:21.460
<v Speaker 1>you need to say what you think because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where you come from.</v>

2546
02:24:22.240 --> 02:24:24.220
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't say what you think,</v>

2547
02:24:24.221 --> 02:24:27.460
<v Speaker 1>then you kill your unborn self.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you do.</v>

2548
02:24:27.461 --> 02:24:32.461
<v Speaker 1>That's what Cain did when he killed Abel</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's why his punishment was </v>

2549
02:24:32.461 --> 02:24:33.760
<v Speaker 1>unbearable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you have things in you that are</v>

2550
02:24:33.761 --> 02:24:36.100
<v Speaker 1>struggling to come to the light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the truth.</v>

2551
02:24:36.101 --> 02:24:39.310
<v Speaker 1>You need data and you need to either </v>
<v Speaker 1>that truth because without that truth,</v>

2552
02:24:39.311 --> 02:24:43.450
<v Speaker 1>who cannot live in the world because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world is real and you need truth to live</v>

2553
02:24:43.451 --> 02:24:45.820
<v Speaker 1>in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you stifle your truth,</v>

2554
02:24:45.821 --> 02:24:47.140
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

2555
02:24:47.290 --> 02:24:50.350
<v Speaker 1>how can that be anything but something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that brings about hell,</v>

2556
02:24:50.470 --> 02:24:53.170
<v Speaker 1>how could it be any other way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you think,</v>

2557
02:24:53.171 --> 02:24:54.430
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why should you speak up?</v>

2558
02:24:54.431 --> 02:24:57.220
<v Speaker 1>That's easy because the consequences of </v>
<v Speaker 1>not speaking up,</v>

2559
02:24:57.580 --> 02:25:01.150
<v Speaker 1>although delayed are far worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the reason.</v>

2560
02:25:01.390 --> 02:25:04.090
<v Speaker 1>That's the reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it can't be courage,</v>

2561
02:25:04.180 --> 02:25:07.060
<v Speaker 1>it could at least be prudent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

2562
02:25:07.600 --> 02:25:07.840
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

2563
02:25:15.610 --> 02:25:16.300
<v Speaker 3>One more,</v>

2564
02:25:16.920 --> 02:25:17.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr Peterson.</v>

2565
02:25:18.420 --> 02:25:20.790
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kudos for mentioning Magnolias one of my</v>

2566
02:25:20.791 --> 02:25:22.200
<v Speaker 1>favorite movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a great movie,</v>

2567
02:25:22.201 --> 02:25:24.400
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

2568
02:25:24.430 --> 02:25:28.630
<v Speaker 5>a few months ago I had a dream and when </v>
<v Speaker 5>I told someone this dream,</v>

2569
02:25:28.631 --> 02:25:31.120
<v Speaker 5>they suggested that I read the book of </v>
<v Speaker 5>revelations.</v>

2570
02:25:31.180 --> 02:25:32.590
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a bad dream that,</v>

2571
02:25:35.480 --> 02:25:36.090
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2572
02:25:36.990 --> 02:25:41.990
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of interesting stuff in </v>

2573
02:25:41.990 --> 02:25:41.990
<v Speaker 5>that book.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The thing that really,</v>

2574
02:25:43.590 --> 02:25:48.590
<v Speaker 5>that I found really interesting right </v>
<v Speaker 5>off the bat was the state is </v>

2575
02:25:50.760 --> 02:25:52.720
<v Speaker 5>represented,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2576
02:25:52.770 --> 02:25:56.490
<v Speaker 5>in two instances as female,</v>
<v Speaker 5>positively and negatively.</v>

2577
02:25:56.491 --> 02:26:01.491
<v Speaker 5>And I was wondering if you had any </v>
<v Speaker 5>thoughts on that in the context of like </v>

2578
02:26:01.491 --> 02:26:04.320
<v Speaker 5>in maps of meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you often talk about the state just as a</v>

2579
02:26:04.470 --> 02:26:06.360
<v Speaker 5>as male or as masculine.</v>

2580
02:26:08.320 --> 02:26:09.370
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

2581
02:26:09.371 --> 02:26:14.371
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to comment on your tee shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a lobster hierarchy with horace </v>

2582
02:26:14.371 --> 02:26:14.371
<v Speaker 1>at the top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

2583
02:26:14.450 --> 02:26:15.240
<v Speaker 3>It's even better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2584
02:26:15.510 --> 02:26:16.900
<v Speaker 5>it's the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have a lobster.</v>

2585
02:26:20.650 --> 02:26:23.830
<v Speaker 3>The best one that we found.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good one.</v>

2586
02:26:24.750 --> 02:26:29.750
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now in really cracked me up when I saw </v>

2587
02:26:29.750 --> 02:26:29.750
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really thought that was funny,</v>

2588
02:26:29.750 --> 02:26:29.750
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2589
02:26:29.750 --> 02:26:29.970
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2590
02:26:31.010 --> 02:26:32.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My graduate students used to meet,</v>

2591
02:26:32.761 --> 02:26:35.280
<v Speaker 1>when I first talked about this lobster </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

2592
02:26:35.550 --> 02:26:38.040
<v Speaker 1>we'd meet for breakfast and they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>very combative,</v>

2593
02:26:38.041 --> 02:26:43.041
<v Speaker 1>snappy group of graduate students and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're always trying to one up each </v>

2594
02:26:43.041 --> 02:26:45.450
<v Speaker 1>other with jokes and whenever one really</v>
<v Speaker 1>pulled a good joke on another,</v>

2595
02:26:45.451 --> 02:26:50.451
<v Speaker 1>they'd stand up and it was really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was really funny.</v>

2596
02:26:52.681 --> 02:26:54.360
<v Speaker 1>It was really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2597
02:26:55.080 --> 02:26:57.390
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I answer that question?</v>

2598
02:27:03.600 --> 02:27:06.660
<v Speaker 1>You know how if you're looking at a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at a room,</v>

2599
02:27:08.070 --> 02:27:11.640
<v Speaker 1>every color that you see is dependent on</v>
<v Speaker 1>every other color in the room,</v>

2600
02:27:11.670 --> 02:27:13.050
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your eyes adjust to that.</v>

2601
02:27:13.051 --> 02:27:18.051
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're in a room based with red </v>

2602
02:27:18.051 --> 02:27:20.241
<v Speaker 1>light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your eyes will in some sense remove the </v>

2603
02:27:20.241 --> 02:27:21.450
<v Speaker 1>red so you can still see the colors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2604
02:27:22.110 --> 02:27:27.110
<v Speaker 1>so your perception is to some degree on </v>
<v Speaker 1>call is to some degree dependent on con </v>

2605
02:27:28.380 --> 02:27:33.380
<v Speaker 1>context and that's one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes the symbolic symbolic </v>

2606
02:27:33.380 --> 02:27:37.520
<v Speaker 1>interpretations tricky because to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>how something is represented </v>

2607
02:27:37.520 --> 02:27:40.140
<v Speaker 1>symbolically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you actually have to look at the broader</v>

2608
02:27:40.200 --> 02:27:43.980
<v Speaker 1>narrative context within which the </v>
<v Speaker 1>symbols are embedded.</v>

2609
02:27:44.220 --> 02:27:48.630
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me see if I can get this right.</v>

2610
02:27:53.190 --> 02:27:55.650
<v Speaker 1>If the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the story has an island in an ocean,</v>

2611
02:27:56.640 --> 02:28:01.640
<v Speaker 1>then the ocean is often symbolically </v>
<v Speaker 1>feminine and the island is symbolically </v>

2612
02:28:01.640 --> 02:28:01.790
<v Speaker 1>masculine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if the stories,</v>

2613
02:28:01.800 --> 02:28:06.800
<v Speaker 1>the island and the sky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the island often become </v>

2614
02:28:06.800 --> 02:28:10.161
<v Speaker 1>symbolically masculine and feminine and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Sky Symbolically Masculine and you </v>

2615
02:28:10.161 --> 02:28:10.161
<v Speaker 1>might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2616
02:28:10.161 --> 02:28:13.080
<v Speaker 1>how can the Ireland be masculine and </v>
<v Speaker 1>feminine at the same time?</v>

2617
02:28:13.320 --> 02:28:14.430
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2618
02:28:14.431 --> 02:28:18.120
<v Speaker 1>it depends on what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is being contrasted with and why,</v>

2619
02:28:18.840 --> 02:28:23.840
<v Speaker 1>and so that's part of the key to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>change in symbolism in the book of </v>

2620
02:28:23.840 --> 02:28:26.450
<v Speaker 1>revelation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it isn't inevitably the case that</v>

2621
02:28:27.200 --> 02:28:30.710
<v Speaker 1>culture is represented with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>patriarchal symbolism,</v>

2622
02:28:30.920 --> 02:28:34.220
<v Speaker 1>but it's most commonly the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

2623
02:28:34.221 --> 02:28:36.140
<v Speaker 1>there is mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia for example.</v>

2624
02:28:36.350 --> 02:28:41.350
<v Speaker 1>I guess it would depend to some degree </v>
<v Speaker 1>too on what your metaphor is for the </v>

2625
02:28:41.350 --> 02:28:44.981
<v Speaker 1>state because the state can be an all </v>
<v Speaker 1>providing mother or it can be judgmental</v>

2626
02:28:46.910 --> 02:28:51.910
<v Speaker 1>father and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems that we tilt more towards the </v>

2627
02:28:51.910 --> 02:28:55.550
<v Speaker 1>father with regards to terminology </v>
<v Speaker 1>relating to the state.</v>

2628
02:28:55.550 --> 02:29:00.550
<v Speaker 1>And I think the reason for that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think human hierarchies like </v>

2629
02:29:01.250 --> 02:29:04.550
<v Speaker 1>chimp hierarchies are fundamentally </v>
<v Speaker 1>masculine.</v>

2630
02:29:04.970 --> 02:29:06.800
<v Speaker 1>The fundamental hierarchies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>masculine.</v>

2631
02:29:07.010 --> 02:29:09.020
<v Speaker 1>Even with chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a female hierarchy,</v>

2632
02:29:09.021 --> 02:29:13.880
<v Speaker 1>but it's like the female hierarchy is </v>
<v Speaker 1>nested within the male hierarchy.</v>

2633
02:29:13.940 --> 02:29:18.940
<v Speaker 1>It's not the case with bonobos exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think it is the case with human </v>

2634
02:29:18.940 --> 02:29:22.601
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think we have a strong </v>

2635
02:29:22.601 --> 02:29:24.581
<v Speaker 1>proclivity to masculinize the state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean there aren't </v>

2636
02:29:24.581 --> 02:29:25.960
<v Speaker 1>exceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That and symbol,</v>

2637
02:29:26.030 --> 02:29:31.030
<v Speaker 1>symbolic representations are very </v>
<v Speaker 1>slippery that way because you can't </v>

2638
02:29:31.030 --> 02:29:35.290
<v Speaker 1>stamp an entity with assemble because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be the same as just giving it</v>

2639
02:29:35.661 --> 02:29:37.160
<v Speaker 1>a name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

2640
02:29:37.580 --> 02:29:40.580
<v Speaker 1>and you can't have a dictionary of </v>
<v Speaker 1>symbols where you say,</v>

2641
02:29:40.581 --> 02:29:41.540
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2642
02:29:41.640 --> 02:29:43.850
<v Speaker 1>a house always means the psyche.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2643
02:29:43.880 --> 02:29:46.160
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes the house means the psyche,</v>

2644
02:29:46.310 --> 02:29:51.310
<v Speaker 1>but it depends on the story and so you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to take the entire structure of the</v>

2645
02:29:52.581 --> 02:29:57.581
<v Speaker 1>narrative into account to determine why </v>
<v Speaker 1>those particular symbolic </v>

2646
02:29:57.581 --> 02:29:58.310
<v Speaker 1>representations are being used.</v>

2647
02:29:59.150 --> 02:30:01.670
<v Speaker 1>When I offered in maps of meaning was </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of a shorthand,</v>

2648
02:30:01.850 --> 02:30:03.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking,</v>

2649
02:30:03.920 --> 02:30:06.860
<v Speaker 1>there's nature positive and negative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually feminine.</v>

2650
02:30:07.070 --> 02:30:09.650
<v Speaker 1>Generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's culture positive and negative.</v>

2651
02:30:09.800 --> 02:30:12.350
<v Speaker 1>Usually masculine and generally </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking,</v>

2652
02:30:12.351 --> 02:30:15.170
<v Speaker 1>there's the individual good and evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2653
02:30:15.171 --> 02:30:19.190
<v Speaker 1>Heroic can adversarial often typically </v>
<v Speaker 1>represented as masculine,</v>

2654
02:30:19.220 --> 02:30:24.220
<v Speaker 1>especially in adventure stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a ski mountain and it's an </v>

2655
02:30:24.651 --> 02:30:29.651
<v Speaker 1>interpretive guide and not a set of hard</v>
<v Speaker 1>and fast rules because you're in the </v>

2656
02:30:29.651 --> 02:30:31.640
<v Speaker 1>domain of metaphor and it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a slippery domain.</v>

2657
02:30:32.330 --> 02:30:34.760
<v Speaker 1>So do you have any luck figuring out </v>
<v Speaker 1>your dream?</v>

2658
02:30:36.670 --> 02:30:41.670
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you have any luck figuring out your </v>

2659
02:30:41.670 --> 02:30:43.571
<v Speaker 1>dream?</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least in some parts.</v>

2660
02:30:44.300 --> 02:30:47.420
<v Speaker 1>I think there's different levels of </v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis.</v>

2661
02:30:49.420 --> 02:30:51.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean one was pretty obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2662
02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:52.960
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

2663
02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:53.870
<v Speaker 1>Well thank you very much.</v>
