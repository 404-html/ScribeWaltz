1
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:03.833
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

2
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.340
<v Speaker 1>we're actually going to take a step </v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

3
00:00:08.341 --> 00:00:12.510
<v Speaker 1>Historically</v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about Carl Rogers last time</v>

4
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:15.803
<v Speaker 1>as a phenomenologist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we started our brief foray into the </v>

5
00:00:19.201 --> 00:00:20.034
<v Speaker 1>ideas behind phenomenology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now we're going to go back in time </v>

6
00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:23.163
<v Speaker 1>the up and we're going to talk about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>end of the 19th century and we're going </v>

7
00:00:27.571 --> 00:00:32.571
<v Speaker 1>to discuss Nietzsche and Dostoevsky and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kierkegaard in some detail.</v>

8
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.150
<v Speaker 1>And the reason we're going to do that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>because those three men,</v>

9
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.450
<v Speaker 1>I s I would say more than anyone else in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 19th century laid the groundwork not</v>

10
00:00:41.551 --> 00:00:42.384
<v Speaker 1>only for what would become </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalysis and then later </v>

11
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.910
<v Speaker 1>personality psychology and clinical </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology,</v>

12
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.620
<v Speaker 1>but they also describe the broader </v>
<v Speaker 1>social,</v>

13
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.830
<v Speaker 1>political and cultural situation that </v>
<v Speaker 1>modern people find themselves in now</v>

14
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:00.743
<v Speaker 1>and their thought is exceedingly </v>
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated and it's really worth </v>

15
00:01:04.351 --> 00:01:09.330
<v Speaker 1>grasping because if you can get it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

16
00:01:09.331 --> 00:01:10.164
<v Speaker 1>we're going through these personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>theories one of the time and we're </v>

17
00:01:12.961 --> 00:01:13.794
<v Speaker 1>making,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to make for reason to biology and </v>

18
00:01:15.691 --> 00:01:20.130
<v Speaker 1>neuro psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need a structure underneath that.</v>

19
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.963
<v Speaker 1>You need to understand a structure </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's underneath all of that to slot </v>

20
00:01:23.521 --> 00:01:24.354
<v Speaker 1>everything into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that way you can understand it </v>

21
00:01:25.741 --> 00:01:28.290
<v Speaker 1>in more detail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>

22
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.653
<v Speaker 1>partly because ideas develop </v>
<v Speaker 1>historically and also an idea as a seed </v>

23
00:01:34.651 --> 00:01:36.970
<v Speaker 1>and out of the seed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other plants grow and,</v>

24
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.933
<v Speaker 1>and so forth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the plant grows and so forth and </v>

25
00:01:39.661 --> 00:01:40.494
<v Speaker 1>branches off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can get back down to the origin </v>

26
00:01:42.361 --> 00:01:45.480
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can often understand the entire</v>

27
00:01:45.481 --> 00:01:46.314
<v Speaker 1>structure more straightforwardly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also these three men are so </v>

28
00:01:51.751 --> 00:01:52.584
<v Speaker 1>brilliant that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a joy to encounter their thinking </v>

29
00:01:56.431 --> 00:01:57.630
<v Speaker 1>even though it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>

30
00:01:57.631 --> 00:01:58.560
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

31
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.890
<v Speaker 1>some verses seriously subversive.</v>

32
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.660
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to start with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>diagram,</v>

33
00:02:06.661 --> 00:02:08.910
<v Speaker 1>which you'll remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

34
00:02:08.911 --> 00:02:09.301
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

35
00:02:09.301 --> 00:02:11.780
<v Speaker 1>so think about this from the Piaget of </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

36
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.500
<v Speaker 1>Like we made the point that as the child</v>
<v Speaker 1>puts itself,</v>

37
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.560
<v Speaker 1>let's say together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it starts by practicing micro routines,</v>

38
00:02:22.321 --> 00:02:23.154
<v Speaker 1>micro motor routines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those are accompanied by perceptual </v>

39
00:02:25.921 --> 00:02:26.820
<v Speaker 1>frameworks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

40
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.833
<v Speaker 1>and also they're incorporated into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivational value system because </v>

41
00:02:30.341 --> 00:02:31.174
<v Speaker 1>they're motivated actions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the child practice is </v>

42
00:02:35.251 --> 00:02:40.251
<v Speaker 1>sequencing those micro personalities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll say together to make ever more and</v>

43
00:02:40.411 --> 00:02:44.760
<v Speaker 1>more complex and ever more and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>integrated macro personalities.</v>

44
00:02:44.761 --> 00:02:47.760
<v Speaker 1>And so that's basically what this </v>
<v Speaker 1>diagram describes.</v>

45
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.333
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were looking at it from an adult </v>

46
00:02:50.791 --> 00:02:53.040
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

47
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.073
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to be a good person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can decompose being a good person </v>

48
00:02:58.111 --> 00:03:01.450
<v Speaker 1>into sub of being a good person and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can decode it.</v>

49
00:03:01.451 --> 00:03:04.090
<v Speaker 1>So being a good person as an abstract </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideal,</v>

50
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.133
<v Speaker 1>but as you move closer and closer to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>point where the goodness is manifested </v>

51
00:03:10.091 --> 00:03:10.924
<v Speaker 1>in action,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you move closer and closer to actual </v>

52
00:03:12.491 --> 00:03:13.780
<v Speaker 1>movements in the world.</v>

53
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.250
<v Speaker 1>And so the abstract category good person</v>
<v Speaker 1>is actually made out of,</v>

54
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:19.383
<v Speaker 1>you could think about it as a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex melody of motor motor actions </v>

55
00:03:23.591 --> 00:03:24.424
<v Speaker 1>and perceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perception is very tightly linked to </v>

56
00:03:26.351 --> 00:03:28.450
<v Speaker 1>motor action because whenever you </v>
<v Speaker 1>perceive anything,</v>

57
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:29.553
<v Speaker 1>you're doing it in part by actively </v>
<v Speaker 1>investigating world's partly why your </v>

58
00:03:32.141 --> 00:03:33.740
<v Speaker 1>eyes are moving around all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if,</v>

59
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.560
<v Speaker 1>if you're listening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you move your head,</v>

60
00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to touch something,</v>

61
00:03:37.001 --> 00:03:37.834
<v Speaker 1>you have to actively investigate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's always an activity of </v>

62
00:03:39.731 --> 00:03:43.870
<v Speaker 1>exploration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now in some ways</v>

63
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.560
<v Speaker 1>when you think about the child piecing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

64
00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:53.440
<v Speaker 1>it's being together from the bottom up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can think about that as a biological</v>

65
00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:56.020
<v Speaker 1>process unfolding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

66
00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.883
<v Speaker 1>and you could take up the child is </v>
<v Speaker 1>crawling and then learning to walk as a </v>

67
00:03:59.141 --> 00:04:03.190
<v Speaker 1>biological process unfolding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's an oversimplification because</v>

68
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.060
<v Speaker 1>human beings exist from day one in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

69
00:04:07.061 --> 00:04:08.380
<v Speaker 1>very social world.</v>

70
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:09.633
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is the way that </v>
<v Speaker 1>those behaviors are sub micro </v>

71
00:04:13.841 --> 00:04:18.670
<v Speaker 1>personalities start to organize </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves is always under the influence</v>

72
00:04:18.671 --> 00:04:19.504
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the society in which they're </v>

73
00:04:21.521 --> 00:04:23.500
<v Speaker 1>embedded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

74
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Piaget talked about the child has as,</v>

75
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.630
<v Speaker 1>as being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

76
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.333
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as having reflex basic builtin reflexes </v>

77
00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.980
<v Speaker 1>at birth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>

78
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.833
<v Speaker 1>that those reflexes are that elaborate </v>
<v Speaker 1>it up into more and more complex </v>

79
00:04:40.901 --> 00:04:41.734
<v Speaker 1>structures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can think that even the </v>

80
00:04:42.371 --> 00:04:45.730
<v Speaker 1>elaboration of those basic reflexes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even right from the beginning,</v>

81
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.890
<v Speaker 1>like there's a routing and sucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>reflex,</v>

82
00:04:47.891 --> 00:04:48.724
<v Speaker 1>which you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can listen from a child by tapping </v>

83
00:04:50.411 --> 00:04:52.330
<v Speaker 1>on the side of it's cheap when it's very</v>
<v Speaker 1>new,</v>

84
00:04:52.331 --> 00:04:53.164
<v Speaker 1>newly born,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it'll search to try to put what's </v>

85
00:04:54.731 --> 00:04:56.710
<v Speaker 1>happening in its mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

86
00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:57.603
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

87
00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:58.623
<v Speaker 1>that's part of the reflexive process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the builtin perceptual motor unit that </v>

88
00:05:03.941 --> 00:05:05.740
<v Speaker 1>allows the child to begin to suckle.</v>

89
00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:07.390
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing is though,</v>

90
00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.170
<v Speaker 1>what it suckling isn't a static and </v>
<v Speaker 1>objective entity.</v>

91
00:05:11.171 --> 00:05:12.004
<v Speaker 1>It's a person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of breastfeeding is the </v>

92
00:05:14.411 --> 00:05:17.140
<v Speaker 1>establishment of a relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a complex relationship.</v>

93
00:05:17.141 --> 00:05:19.240
<v Speaker 1>Because it's also not only a feeding </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>

94
00:05:19.241 --> 00:05:20.074
<v Speaker 1>it's a caring relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a relationship that's based on </v>

95
00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:23.583
<v Speaker 1>tactile interaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There could be nervousness associated </v>

96
00:05:26.471 --> 00:05:27.640
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

97
00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:28.870
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and often is,</v>

98
00:05:28.871 --> 00:05:32.740
<v Speaker 1>especially for a new mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very complex dynamics social act.</v>

99
00:05:32.741 --> 00:05:35.440
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is that right </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the beginning,</v>

100
00:05:35.441 --> 00:05:39.760
<v Speaker 1>in order for the baby to engage in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>process properly,</v>

101
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:41.103
<v Speaker 1>it has to allow its initial reflects of </v>
<v Speaker 1>movements to be modified by social </v>

102
00:05:47.051 --> 00:05:50.440
<v Speaker 1>necessity immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

103
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.740
<v Speaker 1>if a baby is breastfeeding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can't bite.</v>

104
00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.350
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't have any teeth.</v>

105
00:05:56.351 --> 00:05:59.120
<v Speaker 1>So being bitten isn't necessarily a </v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe,</v>

106
00:05:59.121 --> 00:05:59.954
<v Speaker 1>but it's not pleasant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what will happen if the baby </v>

107
00:06:02.001 --> 00:06:05.810
<v Speaker 1>bites the mother is that the mother will</v>
<v Speaker 1>pull away and startled the baby and then</v>

108
00:06:05.811 --> 00:06:06.630
<v Speaker 1>the baby will cry.</v>

109
00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:07.463
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mother will be at least startled by </v>

110
00:06:10.701 --> 00:06:12.470
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the error.</v>

111
00:06:12.471 --> 00:06:13.304
<v Speaker 1>And so the baby has to learn to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has to learn to be civilized in some </v>

112
00:06:17.751 --> 00:06:19.310
<v Speaker 1>sense right off the bat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

113
00:06:19.311 --> 00:06:22.730
<v Speaker 1>you know Freud was talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>process of socialization.</v>

114
00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.240
<v Speaker 1>He tended to concentrate more on toilet </v>
<v Speaker 1>training.</v>

115
00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:27.493
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he thought of that as the first </v>

116
00:06:28.431 --> 00:06:32.270
<v Speaker 1>place where the first major place where </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ID of the child,</v>

117
00:06:32.271 --> 00:06:32.781
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

118
00:06:32.781 --> 00:06:33.614
<v Speaker 1>or which Rogers would regard as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>organismic as the organismic </v>

119
00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:43.490
<v Speaker 1>experiential domain is brought under </v>
<v Speaker 1>control of the superego.</v>

120
00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:45.620
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because at the baby,</v>

121
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:50.150
<v Speaker 1>obviously it's fundamental biological </v>
<v Speaker 1>function is to relieve itself,</v>

122
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:53.630
<v Speaker 1>but that has to come under very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very strict social control.</v>

123
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.300
<v Speaker 1>And it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a complex form of learning.</v>

124
00:06:56.301 --> 00:06:57.134
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's basically the acquisition of </v>

125
00:06:58.311 --> 00:07:03.311
<v Speaker 1>voluntary control over what was here too</v>
<v Speaker 1>for an involuntary reflex essentially.</v>

126
00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:07.550
<v Speaker 1>And so that can go well or it can go </v>
<v Speaker 1>badly and it can vary,</v>

127
00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:09.090
<v Speaker 1>go very badly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

128
00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.273
<v Speaker 1>I knew a family who had a daughter at </v>
<v Speaker 1>one point and that daughter would only </v>

129
00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.340
<v Speaker 1>defecate in her diaper when she was </v>
<v Speaker 1>three.</v>

130
00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.340
<v Speaker 1>So that meant she had full of voluntary </v>
<v Speaker 1>control of her bowel function,</v>

131
00:07:19.341 --> 00:07:20.174
<v Speaker 1>but there was no way she was going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>participate in the social ritual that </v>

132
00:07:24.201 --> 00:07:25.034
<v Speaker 1>surrounded proper toilet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a war going on like a serious </v>

133
00:07:28.671 --> 00:07:31.580
<v Speaker 1>war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that sort of thing happens while not</v>

134
00:07:31.581 --> 00:07:32.414
<v Speaker 1>infrequently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course you remember in the crumb </v>

135
00:07:34.341 --> 00:07:36.170
<v Speaker 1>movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mother,</v>

136
00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:37.483
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the boys accusing the mother of giving </v>

137
00:07:38.781 --> 00:07:42.770
<v Speaker 1>them enemas and her of course denying </v>
<v Speaker 1>that any such thing happened,</v>

138
00:07:42.771 --> 00:07:45.020
<v Speaker 1>which was something that made both of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them roll their eyes,</v>

139
00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:46.760
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they all laughed,</v>

140
00:07:46.761 --> 00:07:48.770
<v Speaker 1>but it's really not particularly </v>
<v Speaker 1>amusing.</v>

141
00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.590
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my point is,</v>

142
00:07:51.591 --> 00:07:52.424
<v Speaker 1>is that even at the micro level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the manifestation of what we'll call </v>

143
00:07:57.231 --> 00:07:58.064
<v Speaker 1>micro personalities expands and </v>
<v Speaker 1>organizes into an environment that's </v>

144
00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.580
<v Speaker 1>conditioned by social expectation.</v>

145
00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:06.560
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then,</v>

146
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:08.503
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is something we haven't talked </v>

147
00:08:09.891 --> 00:08:13.010
<v Speaker 1>about before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One thing you might ask is,</v>

148
00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:13.873
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where does the social expectation come </v>

149
00:08:16.281 --> 00:08:17.114
<v Speaker 1>from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's a very complex question </v>

150
00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:22.340
<v Speaker 1>because in some sense that's the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>question is that as,</v>

151
00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:23.293
<v Speaker 1>where does culture come from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly a complex question </v>

152
00:08:26.151 --> 00:08:26.984
<v Speaker 1>because you have to take into account </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary history which provides the </v>

153
00:08:31.971 --> 00:08:34.250
<v Speaker 1>substrata for the development of </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

154
00:08:34.251 --> 00:08:37.010
<v Speaker 1>So that would be human biology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've take that into account and then you</v>

155
00:08:37.011 --> 00:08:39.350
<v Speaker 1>have to take human history into account </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

156
00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:42.320
<v Speaker 1>and we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you don't have to take into account</v>

157
00:08:42.321 --> 00:08:43.940
<v Speaker 1>is not clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

158
00:08:43.941 --> 00:08:44.774
<v Speaker 1>Because it's very difficult to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to track the origins of the social </v>

159
00:08:48.981 --> 00:08:51.770
<v Speaker 1>routines that make up the fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>social contract.</v>

160
00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:52.963
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know how to behave properly roughly </v>

161
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:55.823
<v Speaker 1>speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a set of expectations in a set </v>

162
00:08:57.661 --> 00:08:58.494
<v Speaker 1>of wants for about the way that other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are going to behave with regards </v>

163
00:09:02.011 --> 00:09:02.844
<v Speaker 1>to us and they return the favor and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone is participating in this and </v>

164
00:09:06.391 --> 00:09:09.510
<v Speaker 1>everybody basically knows it unless </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very poorly socialized.</v>

165
00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:11.220
<v Speaker 1>And you can usually tell that right </v>
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

166
00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:12.323
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids can tell that because if a three </v>

167
00:09:14.011 --> 00:09:14.844
<v Speaker 1>year old is playing with another three </v>
<v Speaker 1>year old and one of them is poorly </v>

168
00:09:17.071 --> 00:09:17.904
<v Speaker 1>socialized and so maybe has the </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavioral repertoire of a fairly badly </v>

169
00:09:20.911 --> 00:09:21.744
<v Speaker 1>behaved two year old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other three year old being socially </v>

170
00:09:24.361 --> 00:09:27.240
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated will say will not play </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the first.</v>

171
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:28.943
<v Speaker 1>So even though they might be perfectly </v>
<v Speaker 1>happy to play for a time with an actual </v>

172
00:09:32.071 --> 00:09:35.970
<v Speaker 1>two year old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it doesn't take very long,</v>

173
00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:37.373
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard about the age of three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The children are already sophisticated </v>

174
00:09:40.081 --> 00:09:45.081
<v Speaker 1>enough to have embodied the rules that </v>
<v Speaker 1>constitute appropriate cultural behavior</v>

175
00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.500
<v Speaker 1>and those rules or their patterns </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually for the,</v>

176
00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:50.393
<v Speaker 1>they're not exactly rules for the child </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the child couldn't explicitly </v>

177
00:09:53.041 --> 00:09:55.500
<v Speaker 1>state them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they can act them out.</v>

178
00:09:55.501 --> 00:09:58.380
<v Speaker 1>Now you remember now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Piaget talked about this a fair bit,</v>

179
00:09:58.381 --> 00:09:58.590
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

180
00:09:58.590 --> 00:09:59.423
<v Speaker 1>Because he said that part of the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the slightly larger micro </v>

181
00:10:05.791 --> 00:10:10.791
<v Speaker 1>personality say of a two year old are </v>
<v Speaker 1>integrated into the broader social world</v>

182
00:10:11.011 --> 00:10:15.090
<v Speaker 1>is through games that are played with </v>
<v Speaker 1>peers and with older children.</v>

183
00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:20.240
<v Speaker 1>And the Games are ways that like a game </v>
<v Speaker 1>is fundamentally a negotiated.</v>

184
00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:23.033
<v Speaker 1>It's a negotiated sphere of action and </v>
<v Speaker 1>perception that has a particular goal </v>

185
00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:31.950
<v Speaker 1>and the goal is defined by the players </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the sphere of interaction as defined</v>

186
00:10:31.951 --> 00:10:34.050
<v Speaker 1>by the players.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then if you're a good player,</v>

187
00:10:34.051 --> 00:10:34.884
<v Speaker 1>what happens is that you become part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a higher order structure and the higher </v>

188
00:10:38.221 --> 00:10:41.070
<v Speaker 1>order structure is the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're playing soccer,</v>

189
00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:42.083
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden if you're civilized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you do is you manifest those </v>

190
00:10:44.701 --> 00:10:45.534
<v Speaker 1>behaviors that are appropriate to </v>
<v Speaker 1>playing soccer and you subordinate your </v>

191
00:10:49.501 --> 00:10:50.334
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily subordinate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your individuality at that point to the </v>

192
00:10:53.551 --> 00:10:55.230
<v Speaker 1>higher order structure of the game.</v>

193
00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:58.590
<v Speaker 1>That's a communal agreement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a basic social contract.</v>

194
00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:03.950
<v Speaker 1>And so you practice being part of basic </v>
<v Speaker 1>social contracts by playing games.</v>

195
00:11:04.111 --> 00:11:04.944
<v Speaker 1>And you can do that with games that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense relatively straight </v>

196
00:11:09.221 --> 00:11:14.221
<v Speaker 1>forward and regulated by strict </v>
<v Speaker 1>conventions and articulated rules.</v>

197
00:11:14.251 --> 00:11:15.084
<v Speaker 1>And so that would be like a soccer game </v>
<v Speaker 1>or you can do it in a more complex way </v>

198
00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:20.010
<v Speaker 1>and on the less,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

199
00:11:20.011 --> 00:11:20.910
<v Speaker 1>less,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

200
00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:27.090
<v Speaker 1>less structured and less articulated </v>
<v Speaker 1>manner by engaging in dramatic play.</v>

201
00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:28.433
<v Speaker 1>And so what children usually do when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing that is that they'll </v>

202
00:11:30.511 --> 00:11:34.260
<v Speaker 1>gather round little group and they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll lay out the drama.</v>

203
00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:38.910
<v Speaker 1>So the drama would be we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>simulate x,</v>

204
00:11:38.911 --> 00:11:43.110
<v Speaker 1>we're going to send you like a family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then everybody is assigned a role.</v>

205
00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:45.570
<v Speaker 1>And so you're supposed to act out your </v>
<v Speaker 1>role,</v>

206
00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:46.433
<v Speaker 1>but exactly how you're supposed to act </v>
<v Speaker 1>it out is left open during the gate so </v>

207
00:11:49.711 --> 00:11:52.680
<v Speaker 1>you can riff and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and improvise.</v>

208
00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:53.973
<v Speaker 1>And basically what children are doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're doing that is acting out </v>

209
00:11:58.060 --> 00:11:58.893
<v Speaker 1>the family and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they need to get the family in </v>

210
00:12:01.151 --> 00:12:01.984
<v Speaker 1>their bones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because being a parent isn't a set of </v>

211
00:12:05.081 --> 00:12:08.140
<v Speaker 1>ideas about parenting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a set of behaviors.</v>

212
00:12:08.141 --> 00:12:12.370
<v Speaker 1>It's a dance that you learn to have with</v>
<v Speaker 1>your children and with your partner.</v>

213
00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:13.353
<v Speaker 1>And it's very complicated and the rules </v>
<v Speaker 1>go far beyond what you could ever </v>

214
00:12:16.931 --> 00:12:18.100
<v Speaker 1>articulate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

215
00:12:18.101 --> 00:12:19.720
<v Speaker 1>cause you can ask yourself a question </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

216
00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:22.750
<v Speaker 1>well how should you discipline a child?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well first of all,</v>

217
00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:25.690
<v Speaker 1>you can argue about that forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But second of all,</v>

218
00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:31.090
<v Speaker 1>you cannot actually elaborate a set of </v>
<v Speaker 1>principles that will guide your behavior</v>

219
00:12:31.091 --> 00:12:31.924
<v Speaker 1>in every situation where a child is </v>
<v Speaker 1>likely to disrupt the social </v>

220
00:12:34.751 --> 00:12:35.584
<v Speaker 1>circumstance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to be smarter than you can </v>

221
00:12:37.841 --> 00:12:41.890
<v Speaker 1>say in order to be good at doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>something as complicated as disciplining</v>

222
00:12:41.891 --> 00:12:42.724
<v Speaker 1>a child.</v>

223
00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:43.583
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because discipline also means </v>

224
00:12:44.111 --> 00:12:45.100
<v Speaker 1>encouraging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

225
00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:48.700
<v Speaker 1>Cause it part of discipline it as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't do those things.</v>

226
00:12:48.701 --> 00:12:52.480
<v Speaker 1>But another part of it is you should </v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely do more of those things.</v>

227
00:12:52.481 --> 00:12:55.420
<v Speaker 1>And so it's the inculcation of a moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>code.</v>

228
00:12:55.421 --> 00:12:59.950
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of that's done through um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nonverbal behavior and through,</v>

229
00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:01.143
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>providing a role model for spontaneous </v>

230
00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:06.400
<v Speaker 1>imitation and all sorts of things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't verbal.</v>

231
00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:07.923
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

232
00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:13.090
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so piaget talked about the game and then</v>

233
00:13:13.091 --> 00:13:13.924
<v Speaker 1>you can take that game's become more and</v>
<v Speaker 1>more complex and more and more abstract </v>

234
00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:18.033
<v Speaker 1>and more and more like real life as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>mature until they may be the games </v>

235
00:13:22.571 --> 00:13:26.050
<v Speaker 1>transform into what sociologists would </v>
<v Speaker 1>refer to as roles.</v>

236
00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.600
<v Speaker 1>So the role you're playing at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment,</v>

237
00:13:28.601 --> 00:13:29.434
<v Speaker 1>at least in principle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is student and you know it's a game and </v>

238
00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:36.640
<v Speaker 1>it's a game because it's a fiction in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense,</v>

239
00:13:36.641 --> 00:13:37.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a fiction,</v>

240
00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:39.700
<v Speaker 1>it's a dramatic fiction in some sense.</v>

241
00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:44.700
<v Speaker 1>The only reason that it exists as a role</v>
<v Speaker 1>is because society is structured in such</v>

242
00:13:45.401 --> 00:13:46.234
<v Speaker 1>a way that enables,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this too enables you to do what you're </v>

243
00:13:49.121 --> 00:13:49.954
<v Speaker 1>doing and to live at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not exactly adaptation to the </v>

244
00:13:53.081 --> 00:13:53.830
<v Speaker 1>normal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

245
00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:56.260
<v Speaker 1>to the natural world and in a sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the in,</v>

246
00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:57.760
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in any sense of the word.</v>

247
00:13:58.090 --> 00:14:02.260
<v Speaker 1>But it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also real life or maybe it's almost</v>

248
00:14:02.261 --> 00:14:03.094
<v Speaker 1>as close to real life as you ever get </v>
<v Speaker 1>because almost everything that modern </v>

249
00:14:05.441 --> 00:14:06.274
<v Speaker 1>people do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe this is true for a long time </v>

250
00:14:08.231 --> 00:14:10.870
<v Speaker 1>into the past is game like in its </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>

251
00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.300
<v Speaker 1>So the game's just get more and more and</v>
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>

252
00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:16.270
<v Speaker 1>They're more and more and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>encompassing in some sense.</v>

253
00:14:16.271 --> 00:14:17.650
<v Speaker 1>But you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

254
00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:18.963
<v Speaker 1>it's almost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can almost say that it never comes </v>

255
00:14:20.771 --> 00:14:23.980
<v Speaker 1>to the point where what you're doing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>no longer playing a game.</v>

256
00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:25.900
<v Speaker 1>Now that's a bit of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>oversimplification,</v>

257
00:14:25.901 --> 00:14:28.480
<v Speaker 1>but because there are games and medic </v>
<v Speaker 1>games,</v>

258
00:14:28.481 --> 00:14:30.850
<v Speaker 1>but we won't talk about the [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 1>games at the moment.</v>

259
00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:32.523
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now you can understand sort of some </v>

260
00:14:35.141 --> 00:14:38.890
<v Speaker 1>of the lower order games and you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>even understand some of the higher order</v>

261
00:14:38.891 --> 00:14:39.724
<v Speaker 1>roles like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could basically articulate in some </v>

262
00:14:41.981 --> 00:14:45.880
<v Speaker 1>sense what it means to be a student.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you go up the hierarchy,</v>

263
00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:47.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause good person,</v>

264
00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:49.750
<v Speaker 1>a subset of good person could be good </v>
<v Speaker 1>student.</v>

265
00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:52.430
<v Speaker 1>You can kind of articulate what it means</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be a good student,</v>

266
00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:57.460
<v Speaker 1>although you can't fully articulate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you go at levels above that,</v>

267
00:14:58.041 --> 00:15:00.650
<v Speaker 1>like be a good citizen or be a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

268
00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:01.803
<v Speaker 1>but it gets more and more difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fully articulate because of course it's </v>

269
00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:05.653
<v Speaker 1>more and more abstract and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>encompasses more and more territory and </v>

270
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:11.990
<v Speaker 1>so by the time you're at the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>

271
00:15:11.991 --> 00:15:14.090
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a good person.</v>

272
00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:15.523
<v Speaker 1>Well it's much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a much more complex phenomena then </v>

273
00:15:18.111 --> 00:15:20.570
<v Speaker 1>you can articulate it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't be fully articulate it.</v>

274
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:23.360
<v Speaker 1>Now I want to read you something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>needs,</v>

275
00:15:23.361 --> 00:15:24.194
<v Speaker 1>you said,</v>

276
00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:50.173
<v Speaker 1>now you have to listen to this carefully</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's some very interesting </v>

277
00:15:52.371 --> 00:15:56.990
<v Speaker 1>things about the way Nietzsche writes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He writes a floristic Lee and I need for</v>

278
00:15:56.991 --> 00:16:00.260
<v Speaker 1>Islam is a short statement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often only a sentence,</v>

279
00:16:00.261 --> 00:16:03.290
<v Speaker 1>but more typically a paragraph.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next,</v>

280
00:16:03.291 --> 00:16:05.870
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very densely packed with ideas.</v>

281
00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:10.190
<v Speaker 1>And I think you could say in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you read Nietzsche,</v>

282
00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:11.063
<v Speaker 1>the stuff that I'm going to read right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now is from beyond good and evil that </v>

283
00:16:14.061 --> 00:16:19.061
<v Speaker 1>every single sentence has an idea in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's often an original idea.</v>

284
00:16:19.071 --> 00:16:21.200
<v Speaker 1>And that's a remarkable accomplishment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

285
00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:23.450
<v Speaker 1>I've often gone through books and </v>
<v Speaker 1>marked,</v>

286
00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:28.310
<v Speaker 1>I usually fold the top of the page over </v>
<v Speaker 1>mark where I think there's an idea worth</v>

287
00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:30.860
<v Speaker 1>keeping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an idea I haven't run into before.</v>

288
00:16:30.861 --> 00:16:31.694
<v Speaker 1>So it's an original idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say in a typical book I </v>

289
00:16:34.071 --> 00:16:36.260
<v Speaker 1>read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's none of them.</v>

290
00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:40.730
<v Speaker 1>There might be one or two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with nature there's probably 20 on a</v>

291
00:16:40.731 --> 00:16:43.510
<v Speaker 1>page.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it makes it,</v>

292
00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:44.673
<v Speaker 1>if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's packed a tremendous amount of </v>

293
00:16:47.151 --> 00:16:49.640
<v Speaker 1>information into a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very small space.</v>

294
00:16:49.641 --> 00:16:50.474
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he tried to do that and there was a </v>

295
00:16:52.281 --> 00:16:55.280
<v Speaker 1>bunch of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One was his health wasn't very good,</v>

296
00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:58.820
<v Speaker 1>although he was an early stage genius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a full professor in Germany,</v>

297
00:16:58.821 --> 00:17:03.080
<v Speaker 1>I think when he was 22 or 23 which is </v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible because if you don't become a</v>

298
00:17:03.081 --> 00:17:08.081
<v Speaker 1>full professor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially 130 years ago,</v>

299
00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:13.750
<v Speaker 1>140 years ago in a German University at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the age of 23 it just isn't possible.</v>

300
00:17:14.031 --> 00:17:16.880
<v Speaker 1>But he was a spectacular genius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But his health failed him.</v>

301
00:17:16.881 --> 00:17:19.760
<v Speaker 1>And so he had a very difficult time </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing.</v>

302
00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:21.163
<v Speaker 1>And so what he did was spend an awful </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of time thinking and a very short </v>

303
00:17:24.111 --> 00:17:25.190
<v Speaker 1>period of time writing.</v>

304
00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:28.910
<v Speaker 1>And so what that meant was that he would</v>
<v Speaker 1>take a tremendous amount of thought,</v>

305
00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:29.773
<v Speaker 1>genius level thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then compress it into like a single </v>

306
00:17:32.511 --> 00:17:33.344
<v Speaker 1>sentence or a single paragraph.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said that he liked to fuck </v>

307
00:17:35.631 --> 00:17:39.200
<v Speaker 1>philosophize with a hammer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in some sense,</v>

308
00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:40.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

309
00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.170
<v Speaker 1>you know about hierarchy did I just </v>
<v Speaker 1>showed you,</v>

310
00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:45.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talked about the idea that if you hit</v>

311
00:17:45.981 --> 00:17:46.814
<v Speaker 1>something disruptive in your life that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the magnitude of your response is </v>

312
00:17:51.811 --> 00:17:55.830
<v Speaker 1>proportionate to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the elevation of the level,</v>

313
00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:59.130
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's much more damaging to be accused of</v>

314
00:17:59.131 --> 00:18:00.720
<v Speaker 1>being a bad person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

315
00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:03.600
<v Speaker 1>seriously than it is for someone to </v>
<v Speaker 1>complain about,</v>

316
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:04.583
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which side of the plate you happen to </v>

317
00:18:05.581 --> 00:18:07.500
<v Speaker 1>put the forecourt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

318
00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:12.370
<v Speaker 1>and I think you can say that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of think of those uh,</v>

319
00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:16.290
<v Speaker 1>nasty hierarchies of value as nested </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies of,</v>

320
00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:18.560
<v Speaker 1>they're almost like maps in the sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

321
00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:19.403
<v Speaker 1>their little units of they ways that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know how to maneuver in the world and </v>

322
00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:24.660
<v Speaker 1>not in.</v>

323
00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:27.240
<v Speaker 1>What that means is that as you go up the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>

324
00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:30.330
<v Speaker 1>the map is larger and larger and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>comprehensive.</v>

325
00:18:30.331 --> 00:18:33.720
<v Speaker 1>And so if you blow out someone's map of </v>
<v Speaker 1>like which fork to put on the table,</v>

326
00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:37.590
<v Speaker 1>that's not so bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can rectify that no time flat.</v>

327
00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:41.850
<v Speaker 1>It leaves 99.99% of their personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>and tech.</v>

328
00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:46.170
<v Speaker 1>But if you fail a crucial exam for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

329
00:18:46.171 --> 00:18:47.004
<v Speaker 1>and part of the reason that you're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to fit you're a student is because you </v>

330
00:18:49.321 --> 00:18:50.760
<v Speaker 1>want to go to medical school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

331
00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:54.120
<v Speaker 1>that'll blow out like 50 or 60% of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>

332
00:18:54.121 --> 00:18:54.954
<v Speaker 1>Or at least it'll feel that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's because what's happening is </v>

333
00:18:57.541 --> 00:18:58.374
<v Speaker 1>that the structure that you use to </v>
<v Speaker 1>regulate the relationship between you </v>

334
00:19:02.161 --> 00:19:05.340
<v Speaker 1>and the world has become damaged at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>high level.</v>

335
00:19:05.341 --> 00:19:08.460
<v Speaker 1>And that invalidates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you're not a student,</v>

336
00:19:08.461 --> 00:19:12.990
<v Speaker 1>if you're not a good student anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then all of the sub factors that make up</v>

337
00:19:12.991 --> 00:19:15.300
<v Speaker 1>being a good student might be invalid.</v>

338
00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:16.133
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might've put a lot of effort into </v>

339
00:19:17.581 --> 00:19:18.414
<v Speaker 1>being a good student.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if all of a sudden you're not </v>

340
00:19:20.251 --> 00:19:21.810
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to ask yourself,</v>

341
00:19:21.811 --> 00:19:26.550
<v Speaker 1>well what exactly am I and where are all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the errors?</v>

342
00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:28.110
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can be,</v>

343
00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:29.053
<v Speaker 1>well that's an extraordinary difficult </v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitive problem because you've built </v>

344
00:19:32.281 --> 00:19:34.140
<v Speaker 1>that structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows,</v>

345
00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.033
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over what period of time it might be 15 </v>

346
00:19:38.041 --> 00:19:41.040
<v Speaker 1>years or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you've been practicing building that</v>

347
00:19:41.041 --> 00:19:44.760
<v Speaker 1>structure and it's a huge part of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>identity because someone might say,</v>

348
00:19:44.761 --> 00:19:47.400
<v Speaker 1>well what are you even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you'd say a student,</v>

349
00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:49.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might say,</v>

350
00:19:49.171 --> 00:19:50.910
<v Speaker 1>what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they could easily say,</v>

351
00:19:50.911 --> 00:19:52.470
<v Speaker 1>what are you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a student.</v>

352
00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:53.453
<v Speaker 1>While if you're not a student,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in so far as you deserve to </v>

353
00:19:56.221 --> 00:19:59.730
<v Speaker 1>find student,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then just exactly what are you</v>

354
00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:02.383
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

355
00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:03.540
<v Speaker 1>So nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

356
00:20:03.541 --> 00:20:06.960
<v Speaker 1>when he packed a lot of information into</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sentence or a paragraph,</v>

357
00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:09.630
<v Speaker 1>you have to be very careful reading him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And young is like this too,</v>

358
00:20:09.631 --> 00:20:10.464
<v Speaker 1>because he'll throw some information if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you that's packed into a paragraph and </v>

359
00:20:14.221 --> 00:20:17.550
<v Speaker 1>it'll be the kind of information that </v>
<v Speaker 1>disrupts high level structures.</v>

360
00:20:17.551 --> 00:20:19.050
<v Speaker 1>You won't even notice it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that,</v>

361
00:20:19.051 --> 00:20:21.060
<v Speaker 1>and it's because he's so subversive and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

362
00:20:21.061 --> 00:20:23.550
<v Speaker 1>he wanted to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was an aim of his,</v>

363
00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:24.563
<v Speaker 1>he had his reasons to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would say that you have to be broken </v>

364
00:20:27.271 --> 00:20:29.970
<v Speaker 1>down to nothing before you can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>rebuilt.</v>

365
00:20:29.971 --> 00:20:31.770
<v Speaker 1>So it's like a trip to the underworld </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

366
00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:32.873
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I suppose in many ways that's what </v>

367
00:20:35.101 --> 00:20:36.450
<v Speaker 1>philosophy is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

368
00:20:36.451 --> 00:20:37.231
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

369
00:20:37.231 --> 00:20:38.064
<v Speaker 1>you don't learn a new principal without </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowing old principles to disappear </v>

370
00:20:43.471 --> 00:20:46.740
<v Speaker 1>because you can't have the new principal</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the old principal at the same time.</v>

371
00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:47.793
<v Speaker 1>So almost always any radical learning </v>
<v Speaker 1>involves the destruction of old habits </v>

372
00:20:52.451 --> 00:20:54.970
<v Speaker 1>and of action and perception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

373
00:20:54.971 --> 00:20:56.860
<v Speaker 1>that's a kind of death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a,</v>

374
00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:00.220
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an abstract death,</v>

375
00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:03.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't make it not painful.</v>

376
00:21:03.251 --> 00:21:04.084
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the abstract death is of sufficient </v>

377
00:21:06.251 --> 00:21:07.084
<v Speaker 1>intensity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can drive people to suicide because </v>

378
00:21:09.431 --> 00:21:13.780
<v Speaker 1>they regard killing themselves as easier</v>
<v Speaker 1>than making the reparation,</v>

379
00:21:13.781 --> 00:21:14.614
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>facing the anxiety and the suffering </v>

380
00:21:16.631 --> 00:21:17.464
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and going through the intolerably </v>

381
00:21:19.151 --> 00:21:19.984
<v Speaker 1>difficult task of retooling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They may well regard that as more </v>

382
00:21:22.811 --> 00:21:26.680
<v Speaker 1>emotionally threatening then death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

383
00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:28.090
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not that rare.</v>

384
00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:31.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean suicide is rare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not that rare.</v>

385
00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:32.613
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's certainly a behavior that </v>

386
00:21:33.971 --> 00:21:34.804
<v Speaker 1>everyone is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suspect everyone here has known </v>

387
00:21:37.931 --> 00:21:40.930
<v Speaker 1>someone who was touched by suicide in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some way.</v>

388
00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:41.793
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might not be your family member or </v>

389
00:21:43.181 --> 00:21:46.240
<v Speaker 1>even your extended family member,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the probability that you know,</v>

390
00:21:46.241 --> 00:21:49.150
<v Speaker 1>someone who knows someone who committed </v>
<v Speaker 1>suicide is extremely,</v>

391
00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:50.590
<v Speaker 1>extremely likely.</v>

392
00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:54.670
<v Speaker 1>So Nietzsche is a very dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous thinker.</v>

393
00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:55.543
<v Speaker 1>I'm the only person I know who kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>approaches him in that regard is young </v>

394
00:21:59.321 --> 00:22:04.321
<v Speaker 1>and young is actually less troublesome </v>
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of what Dostoyevsky offers</v>

395
00:22:05.141 --> 00:22:07.300
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is destruction.</v>

396
00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:10.540
<v Speaker 1>It's intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant destruction,</v>

397
00:22:10.541 --> 00:22:11.374
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't really offer a solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He sort of sketches out the </v>

398
00:22:14.951 --> 00:22:15.784
<v Speaker 1>possibilities of a solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he died young and then in many ways </v>

399
00:22:19.061 --> 00:22:19.894
<v Speaker 1>what happened was that young picked up </v>
<v Speaker 1>where [inaudible] left off and tried to </v>

400
00:22:22.691 --> 00:22:25.370
<v Speaker 1>solve the problems that need your left </v>
<v Speaker 1>unsolved.</v>

401
00:22:25.371 --> 00:22:28.810
<v Speaker 1>So it was nature for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense along with Dostoyevsky who</v>

402
00:22:28.811 --> 00:22:33.730
<v Speaker 1>really definitively announced the death </v>
<v Speaker 1>of God at the end of the 19th century.</v>

403
00:22:33.731 --> 00:22:34.564
<v Speaker 1>In that left people in some ways bereft </v>
<v Speaker 1>of belief and we're going to talk about </v>

404
00:22:37.811 --> 00:22:41.920
<v Speaker 1>why that's so important in a moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What union was doing was trying to,</v>

405
00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:45.250
<v Speaker 1>while he was trying to rescue the </v>
<v Speaker 1>farther from the underworld in the sense</v>

406
00:22:45.251 --> 00:22:46.084
<v Speaker 1>he was trying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he tried to go back to the religious </v>

407
00:22:47.591 --> 00:22:48.424
<v Speaker 1>traditions that Nietzsche had had </v>
<v Speaker 1>described as fatally anachronistic and </v>

408
00:22:53.531 --> 00:22:55.240
<v Speaker 1>demolished by the claims of science.</v>

409
00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:56.073
<v Speaker 1>He attempted to go back to those </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious traditions and reassess them </v>

410
00:22:59.351 --> 00:23:00.184
<v Speaker 1>from a psychological perspective to pull</v>
<v Speaker 1>back the necessary meaning that was </v>

411
00:23:03.881 --> 00:23:04.714
<v Speaker 1>embedded in them so that people could </v>
<v Speaker 1>reunite with their culture and and in </v>

412
00:23:07.961 --> 00:23:08.794
<v Speaker 1>principle not be so prone to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathological belief systems like </v>

413
00:23:11.441 --> 00:23:15.100
<v Speaker 1>ideology that tend to rush in where </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a gap.</v>

414
00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:19.840
<v Speaker 1>You know when he just said very clearly </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Dostoyevsky knew this as well by the</v>

415
00:23:19.841 --> 00:23:23.890
<v Speaker 1>end of the 19th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that that the death of God would mean</v>

416
00:23:23.891 --> 00:23:24.724
<v Speaker 1>that people would turn on mosques to </v>
<v Speaker 1>rationalistic ideologies and that would </v>

417
00:23:28.871 --> 00:23:29.704
<v Speaker 1>be murderous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They knew that was coming and that's an </v>

418
00:23:31.931 --> 00:23:34.390
<v Speaker 1>amazing prediction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really is amazing prediction.</v>

419
00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:37.690
<v Speaker 1>It just shows you how thoroughly they </v>
<v Speaker 1>understood the structure.</v>

420
00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:38.763
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to read you something by </v>

421
00:23:39.371 --> 00:23:40.204
<v Speaker 1>nature and then we're going to return to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hierarchy so that you can kind of </v>

422
00:23:43.541 --> 00:23:46.990
<v Speaker 1>understand something deeper about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way the hierarchy is structured.</v>

423
00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:48.913
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now he's talking about philosophical </v>

424
00:23:50.421 --> 00:23:54.710
<v Speaker 1>ideas here and he's actually talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about articulated efforts.</v>

425
00:23:55.130 --> 00:23:55.963
<v Speaker 1>So one way that you might think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy is that philosophers or </v>

426
00:23:59.511 --> 00:24:00.344
<v Speaker 1>originate articulated moral principles </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is often the way that people </v>

427
00:24:05.031 --> 00:24:07.040
<v Speaker 1>think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in moral philosophy.</v>

428
00:24:07.041 --> 00:24:10.070
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's the philosophers who come</v>
<v Speaker 1>up with the ideas,</v>

429
00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:13.970
<v Speaker 1>but that isn't what needs you believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's what he said in step.</v>

430
00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:16.163
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

431
00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:21.210
<v Speaker 1>Separate philosophical ideas are not </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything optional or a tournament.</v>

432
00:24:22.661 --> 00:24:23.494
<v Speaker 1>So evolving.</v>

433
00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:27.580
<v Speaker 1>They grow up in connection and </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with each other.</v>

434
00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:30.640
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suddenly an arbitrarily,</v>

435
00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:33.190
<v Speaker 1>they seem to appear in the history of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought.</v>

436
00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:38.460
<v Speaker 1>They nevertheless belong just as much to</v>
<v Speaker 1>assist them as the collective members of</v>

437
00:24:38.501 --> 00:24:40.600
<v Speaker 1>the fauna of a continent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

438
00:24:40.601 --> 00:24:41.434
<v Speaker 1>So it's a very interesting idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first idea that he's putting </v>

439
00:24:43.751 --> 00:24:44.584
<v Speaker 1>forward is that you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best way to think about a </v>

440
00:24:47.711 --> 00:24:48.544
<v Speaker 1>philosophical system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say a philosophical system of ethics is </v>

441
00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:52.323
<v Speaker 1>as if it's different statements are </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals related to one another in an </v>

442
00:24:57.101 --> 00:24:57.934
<v Speaker 1>ecosystem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he has a biological metaphor in some </v>

443
00:25:00.611 --> 00:25:02.050
<v Speaker 1>sense for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

444
00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:04.300
<v Speaker 1>for the emergence of a philosophical </v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

445
00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:05.950
<v Speaker 1>It's quite an interesting way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>

446
00:25:05.951 --> 00:25:06.784
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it makes sense because if a </v>

447
00:25:09.491 --> 00:25:10.324
<v Speaker 1>philosophical system of ethics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a philosophical system that </v>

448
00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:14.253
<v Speaker 1>tells you how and why you should behave </v>
<v Speaker 1>a certain way is about how you should </v>

449
00:25:17.861 --> 00:25:20.680
<v Speaker 1>act and you're a biological being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then of course,</v>

450
00:25:20.681 --> 00:25:23.470
<v Speaker 1>it only makes sense that the concepts </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>

451
00:25:23.471 --> 00:25:26.440
<v Speaker 1>which are guides to actions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can logically be,</v>

452
00:25:26.890 --> 00:25:28.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>considered,</v>

453
00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:30.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>biological entities.</v>

454
00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:31.653
<v Speaker 1>They're abstracted biological entities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they still have the same nature as </v>

455
00:25:34.511 --> 00:25:37.350
<v Speaker 1>biological entities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that means according to Nietzsche,</v>

456
00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:39.460
<v Speaker 1>that they're subject to the same rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

457
00:25:39.461 --> 00:25:42.850
<v Speaker 1>this is the sort of place where he </v>
<v Speaker 1>foreshadows floyd deeply,</v>

458
00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:44.343
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

459
00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:47.393
<v Speaker 1>nature says</v>

460
00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:53.380
<v Speaker 1>they never last belong just as much to </v>
<v Speaker 1>assist them as the collective members of</v>

461
00:25:53.381 --> 00:25:54.214
<v Speaker 1>the forerunner of a continent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is betrayed in the end by the </v>

462
00:25:56.621 --> 00:25:58.540
<v Speaker 1>circumstance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

463
00:25:58.541 --> 00:25:59.374
<v Speaker 1>unfailingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most diverse philosophers always </v>

464
00:26:02.471 --> 00:26:04.090
<v Speaker 1>fill in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

465
00:26:04.091 --> 00:26:09.091
<v Speaker 1>a definite fundamental scheme of </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible philosophies under an invisible</v>

466
00:26:09.251 --> 00:26:10.084
<v Speaker 1>spell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They always resolve once more in the </v>

467
00:26:11.501 --> 00:26:14.260
<v Speaker 1>same orbit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however independent of each other,</v>

468
00:26:14.261 --> 00:26:17.530
<v Speaker 1>they may feel themselves with their </v>
<v Speaker 1>critical or systematic wheels.</v>

469
00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:22.120
<v Speaker 1>Something within them leads them </v>
<v Speaker 1>something impels them indefinite order,</v>

470
00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:22.983
<v Speaker 1>the one after the other to wit the </v>
<v Speaker 1>innate methodology in relationship of </v>

471
00:26:26.501 --> 00:26:27.334
<v Speaker 1>their ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their thinking is in fact far less a </v>

472
00:26:30.641 --> 00:26:32.130
<v Speaker 1>discovery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then erect,</v>

473
00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:32.993
<v Speaker 1>then a re recognizing or remembering a </v>
<v Speaker 1>return and a homecoming to a far off </v>

474
00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:38.133
<v Speaker 1>ancient common household of the soul out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of which these ideas formerly group </v>

475
00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:43.233
<v Speaker 1>philosophizing so far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it kind of activism of the highest </v>

476
00:26:46.141 --> 00:26:47.400
<v Speaker 1>order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

477
00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:50.280
<v Speaker 1>so here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the idea.</v>

478
00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:51.973
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two fundamental ideas that are </v>

479
00:26:53.551 --> 00:26:55.890
<v Speaker 1>embedded in this which actually need you</v>
<v Speaker 1>differentiates.</v>

480
00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:15.783
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to read you another section </v>

481
00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:18.600
<v Speaker 1>that illuminates the first one.</v>

482
00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:21.863
<v Speaker 1>Gradually it became clear to me what </v>
<v Speaker 1>every great philosophy up till now his </v>

483
00:27:24.341 --> 00:27:25.174
<v Speaker 1>consisted of namely the confession of </v>
<v Speaker 1>its originator and a species of </v>

484
00:27:30.161 --> 00:27:30.994
<v Speaker 1>involuntary and unconscious </v>
<v Speaker 1>autobiography and moreover that the </v>

485
00:27:34.781 --> 00:27:35.614
<v Speaker 1>moral or immoral purpose in every </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy has constituted the true </v>

486
00:27:38.651 --> 00:27:41.710
<v Speaker 1>vital germ out of which the entire plant</v>
<v Speaker 1>has always grown.</v>

487
00:27:42.010 --> 00:27:42.843
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is a very radical statement so </v>

488
00:27:44.201 --> 00:27:45.034
<v Speaker 1>because what needs you to saying is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy is even when they declared </v>

489
00:27:48.011 --> 00:27:48.844
<v Speaker 1>themselves a rational are deeply </v>
<v Speaker 1>personal and they're also necessarily </v>

490
00:27:53.261 --> 00:27:58.261
<v Speaker 1>embedded within a motivational structure</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is either pro life or anti life,</v>

491
00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:02.590
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's no value free philosophizing.</v>

492
00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:03.963
<v Speaker 1>What there is is the expression of </v>
<v Speaker 1>biologically and culturally conditioned </v>

493
00:28:07.391 --> 00:28:12.391
<v Speaker 1>being which is conditioned by let's say </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same sort of fundamental forces that</v>

494
00:28:13.091 --> 00:28:13.924
<v Speaker 1>Freud described in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the in the biological realm and then </v>

495
00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:18.963
<v Speaker 1>that's conditioned by the cultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>processes that you just discussed in </v>

496
00:28:21.231 --> 00:28:25.930
<v Speaker 1>relationship to Pha and then what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosopher does is observed that all of</v>

497
00:28:25.931 --> 00:28:27.400
<v Speaker 1>those things are happening.</v>

498
00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:32.530
<v Speaker 1>Allow that to be articulated and </v>
<v Speaker 1>confused that with his own thought,</v>

499
00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:35.110
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a brilliant idea.</v>

500
00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:37.780
<v Speaker 1>Now here's a way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

501
00:28:37.781 --> 00:28:42.520
<v Speaker 1>one of the things Piaget said was that </v>
<v Speaker 1>once children start to play games,</v>

502
00:28:42.521 --> 00:28:43.354
<v Speaker 1>when they're young collective games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can watch the children play the </v>

503
00:28:47.261 --> 00:28:48.094
<v Speaker 1>collective games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like maybe eight kids are playing </v>

504
00:28:49.271 --> 00:28:53.170
<v Speaker 1>marbles or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you can take the young kids out</v>

505
00:28:53.171 --> 00:28:56.080
<v Speaker 1>of the game and you can ask them what </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rules are.</v>

506
00:28:56.350 --> 00:28:57.183
<v Speaker 1>And what'll happen is you'll get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>diverse set I diverse and paradoxical </v>

507
00:29:01.451 --> 00:29:06.451
<v Speaker 1>set of articulated rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is that the children</v>

508
00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:07.713
<v Speaker 1>can play the game when they're in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>game and we're in the or in the context </v>

509
00:29:10.451 --> 00:29:11.284
<v Speaker 1>of all the other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because in some sense the game is </v>

510
00:29:13.421 --> 00:29:17.350
<v Speaker 1>embedded in pieces in all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as long as they're all there,</v>

511
00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:18.130
<v Speaker 1>that all works.</v>

512
00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:18.963
<v Speaker 1>But if you pull the child the way they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have the intellectual wherewithal </v>

513
00:29:22.090 --> 00:29:22.923
<v Speaker 1>to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>describe the patterns of behavior that </v>

514
00:29:25.091 --> 00:29:25.924
<v Speaker 1>make up the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's only to say that they know </v>

515
00:29:28.271 --> 00:29:30.670
<v Speaker 1>things that they can't say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you might say,</v>

516
00:29:30.671 --> 00:29:31.570
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the game,</v>

517
00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:35.110
<v Speaker 1>the rules of the game come first and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then the game emergence.</v>

518
00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:38.950
<v Speaker 1>But that's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the game comes first and only after</v>

519
00:29:38.951 --> 00:29:40.950
<v Speaker 1>that do the rules emerged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course there's that,</v>

520
00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:42.063
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a reciprocal relationship </v>

521
00:29:43.211 --> 00:29:46.270
<v Speaker 1>between them because once the rules are </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhat articulated,</v>

522
00:29:46.271 --> 00:29:48.610
<v Speaker 1>then the game becomes more structured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

523
00:29:48.611 --> 00:29:49.300
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

524
00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:51.400
<v Speaker 1>and the rules can become more structured</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so on.</v>

525
00:29:51.401 --> 00:29:52.234
<v Speaker 1>So the articulation changes the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What needs she is saying the same thing </v>

526
00:29:55.541 --> 00:29:56.374
<v Speaker 1>applies to societies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You says like as in so far as you can </v>

527
00:30:00.341 --> 00:30:01.174
<v Speaker 1>consider society a collective game </v>
<v Speaker 1>played by millions of people over vast </v>

528
00:30:06.281 --> 00:30:07.450
<v Speaker 1>spans of time.</v>

529
00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:12.430
<v Speaker 1>It's a game of games in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it emerged from the bottom up.</v>

530
00:30:12.730 --> 00:30:13.563
<v Speaker 1>It emerged out of biological impulses </v>
<v Speaker 1>and an interpersonal and social </v>

531
00:30:18.041 --> 00:30:20.770
<v Speaker 1>interactions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conditioning and,</v>

532
00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:21.683
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and shaping everyone's behavior and </v>

533
00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:24.243
<v Speaker 1>perception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that happened way before anyone </v>

534
00:30:27.521 --> 00:30:28.354
<v Speaker 1>could articulate what those rules were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you remember when nature was </v>

535
00:30:33.191 --> 00:30:34.024
<v Speaker 1>writing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no real sense of how old the </v>

536
00:30:36.761 --> 00:30:39.000
<v Speaker 1>earth was or how will the universe was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

537
00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:39.843
<v Speaker 1>people thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even the radical people talk thought </v>

538
00:30:41.621 --> 00:30:44.140
<v Speaker 1>maybe in terms of hundreds of thousands </v>
<v Speaker 1>of years,</v>

539
00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:45.403
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now we know that the universe is 14 </v>

540
00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:48.063
<v Speaker 1>billion years old and that the earth is </v>
<v Speaker 1>4 billion years old and that life has </v>

541
00:30:50.921 --> 00:30:54.910
<v Speaker 1>been plentiful on the earth for 3.5 </v>
<v Speaker 1>billion years.</v>

542
00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:55.773
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that the historical context within </v>

543
00:30:58.481 --> 00:31:01.560
<v Speaker 1>which we've originated has expanded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

544
00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:02.613
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by orders of magnitude since the last </v>

545
00:31:04.511 --> 00:31:07.750
<v Speaker 1>19th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then what you think that means is</v>

546
00:31:07.751 --> 00:31:08.584
<v Speaker 1>that the way that our games have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>organized stretches impossibly back in </v>

547
00:31:14.591 --> 00:31:14.980
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

548
00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:16.270
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I already told you,</v>

549
00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:18.920
<v Speaker 1>I believe the story about lobster </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominant is higher,</v>

550
00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:19.953
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even lobsters that's 400 million </v>

551
00:31:22.061 --> 00:31:22.894
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lobsters arrayed themselves in a social </v>

552
00:31:25.121 --> 00:31:25.954
<v Speaker 1>space and they regulate each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that means the lobsters essentially </v>

553
00:31:29.411 --> 00:31:32.230
<v Speaker 1>have a lobster society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

554
00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:37.260
<v Speaker 1>each lobster has biological pre </v>
<v Speaker 1>dispositions that are quite determined.</v>

555
00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:40.170
<v Speaker 1>There are quite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

556
00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:42.670
<v Speaker 1>the lobster is quite a deterministic </v>
<v Speaker 1>creature.</v>

557
00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:43.803
<v Speaker 1>But nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way that those biological </v>

558
00:31:45.161 --> 00:31:45.994
<v Speaker 1>predispositions manifest themselves is </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditioned and shaped by the social </v>

559
00:31:50.561 --> 00:31:52.390
<v Speaker 1>surrounding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you think,</v>

560
00:31:52.391 --> 00:31:55.960
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lobsters start to play games 400 million</v>

561
00:31:55.961 --> 00:31:57.250
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

562
00:31:57.251 --> 00:32:02.170
<v Speaker 1>as we've taken the tremendously long </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary journey across that time,</v>

563
00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:05.500
<v Speaker 1>we'd be playing social games the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

564
00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:08.570
<v Speaker 1>And that means that the way that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>interact with,</v>

565
00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:09.483
<v Speaker 1>with each other has evolved and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>even shaped the way our bioenergy </v>

566
00:32:13.241 --> 00:32:15.830
<v Speaker 1>manifests itself because that's how </v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll culturally,</v>

567
00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:20.200
<v Speaker 1>and then out of that as we became more </v>
<v Speaker 1>capable of abstraction.</v>

568
00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:22.810
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

569
00:32:22.811 --> 00:32:26.010
<v Speaker 1>that's something that really took off </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably 7 million years ago.</v>

570
00:32:26.011 --> 00:32:29.470
<v Speaker 1>And with modern human beings emerging </v>
<v Speaker 1>about 150,000 years ago,</v>

571
00:32:29.471 --> 00:32:32.440
<v Speaker 1>cause we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we separated from the common ancestor of</v>

572
00:32:32.441 --> 00:32:35.320
<v Speaker 1>peep of human beings in chimpanzees </v>
<v Speaker 1>about 7 million years ago.</v>

573
00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:38.710
<v Speaker 1>You can tell that by doing analysis of </v>
<v Speaker 1>genetic differences.</v>

574
00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:39.913
<v Speaker 1>So the brain expanded very rapidly after</v>
<v Speaker 1>that point and our culture became more </v>

575
00:32:43.761 --> 00:32:44.594
<v Speaker 1>and more conscious and articulated then </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex and larger and more </v>

576
00:32:47.901 --> 00:32:49.550
<v Speaker 1>technological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

577
00:32:49.551 --> 00:32:50.384
<v Speaker 1>so it became in some ways more dependent</v>
<v Speaker 1>on social norms and less dependent on </v>

578
00:32:54.951 --> 00:32:57.290
<v Speaker 1>deterministic biological </v>
<v Speaker 1>predispositions.</v>

579
00:32:57.650 --> 00:33:00.320
<v Speaker 1>But we've still been doing that for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very long time.</v>

580
00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:02.390
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's good evidence that,</v>

581
00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:03.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

582
00:33:03.951 --> 00:33:06.590
<v Speaker 1>we started using fire about 2 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago when,</v>

583
00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:09.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forgive me if I told you this already,</v>

584
00:33:09.111 --> 00:33:11.170
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at a human being and you,</v>

585
00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:12.033
<v Speaker 1>and you look at a champion z,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of things you see that </v>

586
00:33:14.211 --> 00:33:15.800
<v Speaker 1>are very different morphologically.</v>

587
00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:18.260
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chip is much shorter,</v>

588
00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:21.770
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much wider and way more powerful.</v>

589
00:33:21.771 --> 00:33:26.690
<v Speaker 1>So like a normal mail champ is about six</v>
<v Speaker 1>times as strong as the strongest Olympic</v>

590
00:33:26.691 --> 00:33:29.420
<v Speaker 1>athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So don't mess with chimps.</v>

591
00:33:29.421 --> 00:33:31.010
<v Speaker 1>They'll tear you apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're really,</v>

592
00:33:31.011 --> 00:33:33.290
<v Speaker 1>really strong and dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

593
00:33:33.330 --> 00:33:35.990
<v Speaker 1>but the chimp has shaped sort of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

594
00:33:36.650 --> 00:33:37.483
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a huge gastrointestinal </v>

595
00:33:39.621 --> 00:33:40.820
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>

596
00:33:40.821 --> 00:33:43.640
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is mostly what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they eat is leaves and leaves,</v>

597
00:33:43.641 --> 00:33:44.474
<v Speaker 1>have no color of content.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they have to eat immense numbers </v>

598
00:33:47.631 --> 00:33:51.620
<v Speaker 1>of leaves and leaves are hard to digest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they have to choose them like mad.</v>

599
00:33:51.621 --> 00:33:52.454
<v Speaker 1>So the typical chimps sits around eight </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours a day chewing and then they have </v>

600
00:33:56.151 --> 00:33:56.984
<v Speaker 1>this tremendously long gastrointestinal </v>
<v Speaker 1>system because it takes that long to </v>

601
00:34:00.771 --> 00:34:03.620
<v Speaker 1>extract any nutrients out of out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>leaves.</v>

602
00:34:03.621 --> 00:34:04.454
<v Speaker 1>While we circumvented that man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as we invented fire and fire </v>

603
00:34:07.941 --> 00:34:12.860
<v Speaker 1>allowed us to outsource our digestion </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you cook most things,</v>

604
00:34:12.861 --> 00:34:15.230
<v Speaker 1>vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more importantly meet,</v>

605
00:34:15.231 --> 00:34:19.450
<v Speaker 1>if you cook them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they become much more bioavailable and,</v>

606
00:34:19.530 --> 00:34:21.830
<v Speaker 1>and it takes much less energy to digest </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

607
00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:24.560
<v Speaker 1>So that way you can shrink your gut and </v>
<v Speaker 1>grow your brain.</v>

608
00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:28.370
<v Speaker 1>And so that's apparently what we did </v>
<v Speaker 1>because here we are,</v>

609
00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:29.383
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively slim at least compared to </v>

610
00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:32.083
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so fire popped up 2 million years </v>

611
00:34:34.791 --> 00:34:36.590
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a real cultural revolution.</v>

612
00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:37.453
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so old that culture revolution </v>

613
00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:40.733
<v Speaker 1>content completely reshaped our bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so this interplay between biology </v>

614
00:34:44.841 --> 00:34:45.674
<v Speaker 1>and cultures can you going on for an </v>
<v Speaker 1>unimaginably long period of time and it </v>

615
00:34:49.251 --> 00:34:54.251
<v Speaker 1>conditions everything we do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now here's a complicated idea.</v>

616
00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:09.260
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so imagine a wolf pack.</v>

617
00:35:10.490 --> 00:35:13.610
<v Speaker 1>Now Wolf pack is a pretty calm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated social group.</v>

618
00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:18.500
<v Speaker 1>It's a fair bit like a primordial human </v>
<v Speaker 1>group,</v>

619
00:35:18.530 --> 00:35:22.970
<v Speaker 1>which is why dogs have been with us for </v>
<v Speaker 1>25,000 years.</v>

620
00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:26.500
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they were wolves that first </v>
<v Speaker 1>started to follow us around and scavenge</v>

621
00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:30.290
<v Speaker 1>or more likely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think someone went out some primordial</v>

622
00:35:30.291 --> 00:35:31.820
<v Speaker 1>hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went out hunting,</v>

623
00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:33.013
<v Speaker 1>killed a wolf female,</v>
<v Speaker 1>found the pops and brought one home for </v>

624
00:35:38.161 --> 00:35:40.260
<v Speaker 1>the children to play with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

625
00:35:40.261 --> 00:35:42.660
<v Speaker 1>and that was the origin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the origin of the dog.</v>

626
00:35:42.661 --> 00:35:45.090
<v Speaker 1>I think it was something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause dorms are basically,</v>

627
00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:48.120
<v Speaker 1>they're basically genetically identical </v>
<v Speaker 1>with wolves.</v>

628
00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:49.283
<v Speaker 1>Now the thing is is we can get along </v>
<v Speaker 1>with dogs and the reason we can get </v>

629
00:35:51.751 --> 00:35:55.140
<v Speaker 1>lauren with dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because dogs have a social organization,</v>

630
00:35:55.530 --> 00:35:56.363
<v Speaker 1>you could call it a dominance hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a fair bit like the human social </v>

631
00:35:59.341 --> 00:36:00.180
<v Speaker 1>organization.</v>

632
00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:05.340
<v Speaker 1>And so you can see that part of what it </v>
<v Speaker 1>means to be human is the same thing that</v>

633
00:36:05.341 --> 00:36:08.700
<v Speaker 1>it means to be a pack animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a dog or a pack animal.</v>

634
00:36:08.701 --> 00:36:11.910
<v Speaker 1>Like our domesticated down flight </v>
<v Speaker 1>courses and the cows for example,</v>

635
00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:14.460
<v Speaker 1>which we can domesticate partly because </v>
<v Speaker 1>their social.</v>

636
00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:15.803
<v Speaker 1>So some of the structure of our social </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization is the same sort of </v>

637
00:36:19.141 --> 00:36:21.930
<v Speaker 1>structure that an animal dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy has,</v>

638
00:36:21.931 --> 00:36:24.150
<v Speaker 1>like a chimpanzee dominance hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

639
00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:27.810
<v Speaker 1>And so we know that chimpanzees and </v>
<v Speaker 1>other primates,</v>

640
00:36:27.811 --> 00:36:28.644
<v Speaker 1>monkeys for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are acutely aware of the levels of </v>

641
00:36:31.471 --> 00:36:34.620
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy in their social structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there are,</v>

642
00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:37.350
<v Speaker 1>I think it's vervet monkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a very funny experiment.</v>

643
00:36:37.650 --> 00:36:41.850
<v Speaker 1>So imagine that the talk vervet monkeys </v>
<v Speaker 1>are like celebrity monkeys,</v>

644
00:36:41.851 --> 00:36:44.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the bottom vervet monkeys are like,</v>

645
00:36:44.610 --> 00:36:46.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dissolute street people.</v>

646
00:36:46.321 --> 00:36:47.154
<v Speaker 1>And so then you take some pictures of </v>
<v Speaker 1>dissolute street people who are just at </v>

647
00:36:50.611 --> 00:36:51.444
<v Speaker 1>the bottom of the hierarchy and you take</v>
<v Speaker 1>some pictures of celebrities and you </v>

648
00:36:53.641 --> 00:36:57.330
<v Speaker 1>show pictures to a human audience and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the human audience,</v>

649
00:36:57.331 --> 00:36:59.370
<v Speaker 1>we'll look at the celebrities longer.</v>

650
00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:00.563
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you take the vervet monkeys and you </v>

651
00:37:01.381 --> 00:37:02.214
<v Speaker 1>take photographs of the top ranking </v>
<v Speaker 1>vervet monkeys and the bottom vervet </v>

652
00:37:04.771 --> 00:37:06.660
<v Speaker 1>monkeys and you showed them to vervet </v>
<v Speaker 1>monkeys,</v>

653
00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:09.420
<v Speaker 1>then the vervet monkeys will look at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>top Reiki Verdun,</v>

654
00:37:09.450 --> 00:37:10.283
<v Speaker 1>vervet monkey photographs more than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom ranking vervet monkey </v>

655
00:37:12.901 --> 00:37:16.620
<v Speaker 1>photographs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in some sense there transfixed by the</v>

656
00:37:16.621 --> 00:37:19.530
<v Speaker 1>individuals who are higher up in the in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the social order.</v>

657
00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:20.940
<v Speaker 1>And that makes sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

658
00:37:20.941 --> 00:37:21.774
<v Speaker 1>Because what you should feel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in a fairly aggressive </v>

659
00:37:26.161 --> 00:37:28.230
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you should feel,</v>

660
00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:31.260
<v Speaker 1>the closer you are to the bottom of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy,</v>

661
00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:32.573
<v Speaker 1>the closer what you should feel for </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever's at the top of the dominance </v>

662
00:37:35.521 --> 00:37:37.230
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That should be,</v>

663
00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:42.330
<v Speaker 1>it should be closer and closer to all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now when people feel off,</v>

664
00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:45.150
<v Speaker 1>they get chills running up and down </v>
<v Speaker 1>their back,</v>

665
00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:45.931
<v Speaker 1>their neck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

666
00:37:45.931 --> 00:37:46.764
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason that happens is because it's </v>

667
00:37:48.361 --> 00:37:49.020
<v Speaker 1>an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an,</v>

668
00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:50.040
<v Speaker 1>it's an activism.</v>

669
00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:50.873
<v Speaker 1>It's a hangover from the time that when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you were threatened by something awe </v>

670
00:37:54.271 --> 00:37:55.104
<v Speaker 1>inspiring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say a snake or a banner or </v>

671
00:37:56.311 --> 00:37:58.560
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your hair,</v>

672
00:37:58.650 --> 00:37:59.483
<v Speaker 1>your for would stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is so that you </v>

673
00:38:01.831 --> 00:38:05.160
<v Speaker 1>look bigger and you still see this </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening all the time with cats,</v>

674
00:38:05.161 --> 00:38:08.820
<v Speaker 1>right to capsule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Normally cat's face each other this way,</v>

675
00:38:08.821 --> 00:38:10.740
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if they start to fight,</v>

676
00:38:10.741 --> 00:38:11.574
<v Speaker 1>they turned sideways and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they each look bigger than they puff </v>

677
00:38:13.951 --> 00:38:14.784
<v Speaker 1>up their fur and their tail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's to show the other cat that </v>

678
00:38:17.371 --> 00:38:19.770
<v Speaker 1>they're really a lot bigger than the cat</v>
<v Speaker 1>first thought.</v>

679
00:38:19.771 --> 00:38:22.770
<v Speaker 1>Now of course they're both doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's a little bit pointless,</v>

680
00:38:22.771 --> 00:38:25.440
<v Speaker 1>but they're just cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know you can give them a break.</v>

681
00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:26.573
<v Speaker 1>But the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that they pile over erect and that's </v>

682
00:38:29.431 --> 00:38:30.630
<v Speaker 1>the same thing that happens.</v>

683
00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:31.463
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're listening to very powerful </v>

684
00:38:32.581 --> 00:38:35.470
<v Speaker 1>music and it deeply affects you and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get chills.</v>

685
00:38:35.471 --> 00:38:36.304
<v Speaker 1>It's like the hair stands up on the back</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your neck and that's a signaling of </v>

686
00:38:39.101 --> 00:38:39.934
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the reason you should feel odd to </v>

687
00:38:41.861 --> 00:38:42.694
<v Speaker 1>award something that's higher up in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominick's heart he is because that </v>

688
00:38:45.491 --> 00:38:47.960
<v Speaker 1>thing has power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like is there,</v>

689
00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:48.823
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's more than one reason a that </v>

690
00:38:49.961 --> 00:38:50.794
<v Speaker 1>thing has power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You better be careful of it because it </v>

691
00:38:52.451 --> 00:38:53.284
<v Speaker 1>will put you in your place and fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of the reason the dominance </v>

692
00:38:55.961 --> 00:39:00.961
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy exists is so that everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>knows their place and they don't have to</v>

693
00:39:01.121 --> 00:39:05.320
<v Speaker 1>be reminded of it by being half killed </v>
<v Speaker 1>on a regular basis.</v>

694
00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:08.650
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe your nine on a scale of one,</v>

695
00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:12.670
<v Speaker 1>one being the top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe your number nine it's not so good,</v>

696
00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:16.720
<v Speaker 1>but number nine and not hurting is a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>better than number nine in line.</v>

697
00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:17.553
<v Speaker 1>They're bleeding on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens with dominance </v>

698
00:39:19.871 --> 00:39:23.740
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies is they usually arrange </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves in part by power.</v>

699
00:39:23.741 --> 00:39:24.574
<v Speaker 1>But by no means only in power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knows where they are and </v>

700
00:39:27.641 --> 00:39:28.474
<v Speaker 1>pretty much everybody stays there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>not even happens over multiple </v>

701
00:39:31.211 --> 00:39:34.240
<v Speaker 1>generations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same in complex primate dominance.</v>

702
00:39:34.241 --> 00:39:37.950
<v Speaker 1>Troops status is heritable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

703
00:39:37.951 --> 00:39:38.784
<v Speaker 1>and you know that there's not much of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>leap between that inheritable bonnet </v>

704
00:39:41.201 --> 00:39:43.330
<v Speaker 1>peace among human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a reflection of,</v>

705
00:39:43.570 --> 00:39:44.403
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's much more complex among human </v>

706
00:39:45.401 --> 00:39:48.010
<v Speaker 1>beings because it's articulated and </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>

707
00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:51.370
<v Speaker 1>But it's the same basic thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

708
00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:56.640
<v Speaker 1>Nietzsche's point was so now imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now here's another problem.</v>

709
00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:01.720
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine that.</v>

710
00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:06.273
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

711
00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:08.340
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you've got a garment,</v>

712
00:40:08.350 --> 00:40:13.350
<v Speaker 1>it's art and it's fairly stable and one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the things you want to do is climb to</v>

713
00:40:14.421 --> 00:40:16.700
<v Speaker 1>the top of the dominant Turkey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason you want to do that,</v>

714
00:40:16.701 --> 00:40:19.520
<v Speaker 1>there's all sorts of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>High quality mates.</v>

715
00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:22.310
<v Speaker 1>That's the primary reason that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular true in humans.</v>

716
00:40:22.570 --> 00:40:27.230
<v Speaker 1>If you're male,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because males are much more differential</v>

717
00:40:27.231 --> 00:40:28.064
<v Speaker 1>reproducers that females,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means a lot of males fail to </v>

718
00:40:30.591 --> 00:40:33.500
<v Speaker 1>reproduce completely and some reproduce </v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot.</v>

719
00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:37.070
<v Speaker 1>Where's the typical woman reproduces at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least some.</v>

720
00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:39.890
<v Speaker 1>So that means competition is more </v>
<v Speaker 1>intense among men.</v>

721
00:40:39.891 --> 00:40:40.724
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of the reason why </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchies tend to be tilted </v>

722
00:40:43.250 --> 00:40:46.070
<v Speaker 1>towards male power because competition </v>
<v Speaker 1>means more to them.</v>

723
00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:47.023
<v Speaker 1>The outcome is more crucial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now part of what happens is that as </v>

724
00:40:51.381 --> 00:40:54.020
<v Speaker 1>people compete within the dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>

725
00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:59.200
<v Speaker 1>what they're doing is to try to figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>out who it is that is fit to be on top.</v>

726
00:41:01.610 --> 00:41:05.960
<v Speaker 1>Now you might think that that's a matter</v>
<v Speaker 1>of power,</v>

727
00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:08.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact your basic social left,</v>

728
00:41:08.701 --> 00:41:09.534
<v Speaker 1>the social constructionists would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>you believe that that was all there is </v>

729
00:41:11.991 --> 00:41:14.630
<v Speaker 1>to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the whole dominance hierarchy is</v>

730
00:41:14.631 --> 00:41:15.464
<v Speaker 1>nothing but a power system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the people on top are there because </v>

731
00:41:18.651 --> 00:41:21.440
<v Speaker 1>they have power and what's there is </v>
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

732
00:41:21.441 --> 00:41:25.190
<v Speaker 1>And by that they need the ability to </v>
<v Speaker 1>enforce their will on other people.</v>

733
00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:29.420
<v Speaker 1>While that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a dopey theory and the reason for</v>

734
00:41:29.421 --> 00:41:31.670
<v Speaker 1>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that if unit dimensional,</v>

735
00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:33.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

736
00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:34.003
<v Speaker 1>that people are multifaceted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no single motivation that's </v>

737
00:41:37.311 --> 00:41:38.300
<v Speaker 1>cake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

738
00:41:38.301 --> 00:41:39.134
<v Speaker 1>for Freud it was saks and aggression and</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you're going to come up with a </v>

739
00:41:41.301 --> 00:41:44.150
<v Speaker 1>couple of potent candidates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are two.</v>

740
00:41:44.151 --> 00:41:48.110
<v Speaker 1>But there's lots of other ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are playful and play as a primary</v>

741
00:41:48.111 --> 00:41:50.090
<v Speaker 1>biological circuit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

742
00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:52.190
<v Speaker 1>we suffer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're hungry,</v>

743
00:41:52.191 --> 00:41:54.170
<v Speaker 1>we're thirsty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're affiliative.</v>

744
00:41:54.530 --> 00:41:59.000
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a lot of biological </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessity</v>

745
00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:01.393
<v Speaker 1>driving the makeup of our personalities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there were biological </v>

746
00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:06.980
<v Speaker 1>subpersonalities to arbitrarily call one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of them.</v>

747
00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:10.640
<v Speaker 1>The source of something as complex as </v>
<v Speaker 1>social organization is,</v>

748
00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:11.600
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

749
00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:12.830
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

750
00:42:12.890 --> 00:42:17.090
<v Speaker 1>it's a false form of monotheism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a crazy idea.</v>

751
00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:18.043
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the kind of idea that only people </v>

752
00:42:20.181 --> 00:42:22.340
<v Speaker 1>who really don't like to think would </v>
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

753
00:42:22.730 --> 00:42:25.610
<v Speaker 1>Because once you come up with that idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all power.</v>

754
00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:28.730
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to think anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone can say to you,</v>

755
00:42:28.731 --> 00:42:29.564
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is complex phenomena x the way it </v>

756
00:42:32.061 --> 00:42:32.894
<v Speaker 1>is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is the economy arranged the way it </v>

757
00:42:34.311 --> 00:42:35.031
<v Speaker 1>is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

758
00:42:35.031 --> 00:42:37.940
<v Speaker 1>it's so that the people at the top can </v>
<v Speaker 1>maintain their power.</v>

759
00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:39.500
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

760
00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:40.873
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But maybe that accounts for 10% of the </v>

761
00:42:43.311 --> 00:42:44.144
<v Speaker 1>reason it doesn't get close to 100%.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of reasons why hierarchies </v>

762
00:42:49.971 --> 00:42:54.530
<v Speaker 1>are structured the way they are and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sheer physical force is one of them,</v>

763
00:42:54.531 --> 00:42:56.390
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's unstable.</v>

764
00:42:56.390 --> 00:42:59.090
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so Frans de Waal,</v>

765
00:42:59.091 --> 00:42:59.924
<v Speaker 1>who was watching chimps organize their </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchies in the art of Zoo </v>

766
00:43:03.531 --> 00:43:04.364
<v Speaker 1>in Holland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>noted quite quickly that it was fairly </v>

767
00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:10.550
<v Speaker 1>typical or recent possible for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>meanest,</v>

768
00:43:10.551 --> 00:43:11.384
<v Speaker 1>ugliest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strongest mail chimp to be the dominant </v>

769
00:43:14.181 --> 00:43:15.014
<v Speaker 1>guide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it was the chimp who learned </v>

770
00:43:16.611 --> 00:43:17.444
<v Speaker 1>to pick up a garbage cabin who act the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hell out of it with this stick because </v>

771
00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:22.460
<v Speaker 1>that intimidated his enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

772
00:43:22.461 --> 00:43:23.294
<v Speaker 1>So it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a bit of create three creativity </v>

773
00:43:24.621 --> 00:43:25.940
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what,</v>

774
00:43:26.450 --> 00:43:27.283
<v Speaker 1>but what the wall found was that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stable hierarchies were never run by </v>

775
00:43:30.261 --> 00:43:31.094
<v Speaker 1>barbarian chimp dictators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that was that </v>

776
00:43:34.221 --> 00:43:36.500
<v Speaker 1>coalitions of other males would take </v>
<v Speaker 1>them out.</v>

777
00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:38.450
<v Speaker 1>And it's because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

778
00:43:38.451 --> 00:43:41.150
<v Speaker 1>well if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're one antisocial,</v>

779
00:43:41.151 --> 00:43:44.810
<v Speaker 1>aggressive male in your tough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like okay,</v>

780
00:43:44.811 --> 00:43:45.644
<v Speaker 1>here are tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But three lesser friendlier males who </v>

781
00:43:49.881 --> 00:43:54.881
<v Speaker 1>are bound together in friendship pact </v>
<v Speaker 1>which chimpanzees form quite intensely.</v>

782
00:43:55.010 --> 00:43:59.300
<v Speaker 1>It's like as soon as that guy turns his </v>
<v Speaker 1>back or it has a bad day or gets hurt,</v>

783
00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:01.430
<v Speaker 1>they're going to jump in there and tear </v>
<v Speaker 1>him to pieces.</v>

784
00:44:01.431 --> 00:44:05.870
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what below found was that the stabler</v>

785
00:44:05.930 --> 00:44:06.763
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzee dominance hierarchies were </v>
<v Speaker 1>run usually by males who are affiliate </v>

786
00:44:10.951 --> 00:44:15.130
<v Speaker 1>of end gregarious who remembered their </v>
<v Speaker 1>social obligations.</v>

787
00:44:15.131 --> 00:44:17.870
<v Speaker 1>So that meant with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with regards to their friendship network</v>

788
00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:22.850
<v Speaker 1>and who are also very good to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>females and the infants in the true,</v>

789
00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:23.713
<v Speaker 1>even if they weren't his.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the idea there is that power is an </v>

790
00:44:27.231 --> 00:44:30.350
<v Speaker 1>unstable basis for the maintenance of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy across time.</v>

791
00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:32.790
<v Speaker 1>Because some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even among chimps,</v>

792
00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:37.050
<v Speaker 1>you have to have the consent of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>governed because you'll get a revolution</v>

793
00:44:37.051 --> 00:44:37.884
<v Speaker 1>otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you know you're going to get a </v>

794
00:44:39.301 --> 00:44:40.134
<v Speaker 1>revolution if you put people in or </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals in a situation where they have </v>

795
00:44:43.561 --> 00:44:44.760
<v Speaker 1>nothing to lose.</v>

796
00:44:45.090 --> 00:44:50.090
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>constraints on how you can act well.</v>

797
00:44:50.791 --> 00:44:53.250
<v Speaker 1>You try to move up the dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy system.</v>

798
00:44:53.251 --> 00:44:54.084
<v Speaker 1>Cause if you're too aggressive and </v>
<v Speaker 1>selfish and you're not grooming anyone </v>

799
00:44:56.941 --> 00:45:00.570
<v Speaker 1>else and you're not communicating with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other creatures in the truth,</v>

800
00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:04.050
<v Speaker 1>they're going to gang up on you and take</v>
<v Speaker 1>you down.</v>

801
00:45:04.110 --> 00:45:07.110
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're going to maneuver your </v>
<v Speaker 1>way up the truth,</v>

802
00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:08.333
<v Speaker 1>you have to be do it in a manner that </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilized enough so that you don't get </v>

803
00:45:12.871 --> 00:45:16.050
<v Speaker 1>everyone against you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what it means is that to maneuver</v>

804
00:45:16.051 --> 00:45:19.560
<v Speaker 1>up a power hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially a complex power art creek,</v>

805
00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:24.000
<v Speaker 1>you have to be a lot more than powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

806
00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:25.470
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

807
00:45:26.310 --> 00:45:31.260
<v Speaker 1>so now we've got this idea that there </v>
<v Speaker 1>are principles governing the movement of</v>

808
00:45:31.261 --> 00:45:34.620
<v Speaker 1>peep of creatures up a dominant tart </v>
<v Speaker 1>even among the animals.</v>

809
00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:38.770
<v Speaker 1>And one of the defining characteristics </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>

810
00:45:39.130 --> 00:45:39.963
<v Speaker 1>that that one of the characteristics </v>
<v Speaker 1>that necessity makes the limit that </v>

811
00:45:44.701 --> 00:45:45.534
<v Speaker 1>process is that over time the troop </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't let anybody climb the dominance </v>

812
00:45:50.881 --> 00:45:53.460
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy who will destabilize the whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance heart.</v>

813
00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:57.510
<v Speaker 1>Cause then that's it game over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at the very least,</v>

814
00:45:57.511 --> 00:45:58.344
<v Speaker 1>you have to learn how to climb up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy so that you don't destabilize </v>

815
00:46:00.931 --> 00:46:04.950
<v Speaker 1>it while you climb because otherwise you</v>
<v Speaker 1>get to the top and there's nothing left.</v>

816
00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:08.340
<v Speaker 1>While an animals know this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know this instinctively.</v>

817
00:46:08.341 --> 00:46:10.740
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when wolves go at it,</v>

818
00:46:10.741 --> 00:46:11.574
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first they puff up and they grow with </v>

819
00:46:12.601 --> 00:46:13.434
<v Speaker 1>each other and they put up their </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulders and like they get more and </v>

820
00:46:16.021 --> 00:46:18.660
<v Speaker 1>more aggressive until attack is </v>
<v Speaker 1>imminent.</v>

821
00:46:18.810 --> 00:46:21.990
<v Speaker 1>And often one of them will back off with</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no fighting,</v>

822
00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:26.910
<v Speaker 1>no one gets damaged and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that's the typical situation.</v>

823
00:46:26.911 --> 00:46:28.220
<v Speaker 1>It's like one says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

824
00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:28.901
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

825
00:46:28.901 --> 00:46:29.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

826
00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:32.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And God only knows why that is.</v>

827
00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:36.240
<v Speaker 1>Often I suspect the wolf with the higher</v>
<v Speaker 1>serotonin level wins because it has less</v>

828
00:46:36.241 --> 00:46:37.080
<v Speaker 1>negative emotion.</v>

829
00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:41.310
<v Speaker 1>And Sarah Donin levels go up as you move</v>
<v Speaker 1>up the dominants heart now.</v>

830
00:46:41.311 --> 00:46:43.770
<v Speaker 1>And then they'll go into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll actually have a fight,</v>

831
00:46:43.771 --> 00:46:45.720
<v Speaker 1>but the fight usually doesn't last very </v>
<v Speaker 1>long.</v>

832
00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:50.070
<v Speaker 1>And then the loser will rollover throw </v>
<v Speaker 1>which show its throat to the winter,</v>

833
00:46:50.071 --> 00:46:52.590
<v Speaker 1>which is quite a behavior cause wolves </v>
<v Speaker 1>tear the throats out of,</v>

834
00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:56.190
<v Speaker 1>of of their prey and the top woolful </v>
<v Speaker 1>back off.</v>

835
00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:57.653
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think about that's unbelievably </v>

836
00:46:59.011 --> 00:47:00.660
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated morality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

837
00:47:00.661 --> 00:47:01.494
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's echos in there of the New </v>

838
00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:04.613
<v Speaker 1>Testament injunction to love your enemy </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's exactly what the wolf is </v>

839
00:47:07.741 --> 00:47:08.820
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

840
00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:11.880
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't know this because it can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>articulate the rule,</v>

841
00:47:12.030 --> 00:47:12.863
<v Speaker 1>but what it's doing is acting as if even</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that attacked you is valuable </v>

842
00:47:17.971 --> 00:47:20.370
<v Speaker 1>in its own right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's part of your truth.</v>

843
00:47:21.210 --> 00:47:23.310
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see there the,</v>

844
00:47:23.311 --> 00:47:23.941
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

845
00:47:23.941 --> 00:47:27.630
<v Speaker 1>the ancient biological origins of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of the,</v>

846
00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:28.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>

847
00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:31.060
<v Speaker 1>of the equality and value of each </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>

848
00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:33.580
<v Speaker 1>So these things have deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep,</v>

849
00:47:33.581 --> 00:47:35.530
<v Speaker 1>deep roots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not arbitrary,</v>

850
00:47:35.890 --> 00:47:37.930
<v Speaker 1>they're not arbitrary and no one </v>
<v Speaker 1>invented them.</v>

851
00:47:37.931 --> 00:47:39.970
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly what Nietzsche is </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying here.</v>

852
00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:45.070
<v Speaker 1>To understand how the abstruse </v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphysical assertions of a philosopher</v>

853
00:47:45.071 --> 00:47:47.350
<v Speaker 1>have been arrived at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is always well,</v>

854
00:47:47.351 --> 00:47:48.184
<v Speaker 1>and why is to first ask oneself what </v>
<v Speaker 1>morality do they or does he a mat </v>

855
00:47:53.830 --> 00:47:54.663
<v Speaker 1>accordingly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do not believe that an impulse to </v>

856
00:47:57.131 --> 00:47:57.964
<v Speaker 1>knowledge is the father of philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that another impulse here as </v>

857
00:48:01.091 --> 00:48:06.091
<v Speaker 1>elsewhere has only made use of knowledge</v>
<v Speaker 1>and mistaken knowledge as an instrument.</v>

858
00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:08.343
<v Speaker 1>But whoever considers the fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>impulses of man with a view to </v>

859
00:48:11.951 --> 00:48:12.784
<v Speaker 1>determining how far they may have here </v>
<v Speaker 1>acted as inspiring genie or as demons </v>

860
00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:19.293
<v Speaker 1>will find that they have all practiced </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy at one time or another and </v>

861
00:48:21.911 --> 00:48:23.680
<v Speaker 1>then each of them would have only been </v>
<v Speaker 1>two.</v>

862
00:48:23.681 --> 00:48:28.240
<v Speaker 1>Glad to look upon itself as the ultimate</v>
<v Speaker 1>end of existence and the legitimate lord</v>

863
00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:30.370
<v Speaker 1>of over all of the other impulses.</v>

864
00:48:30.730 --> 00:48:31.980
<v Speaker 1>So what is he saying there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

865
00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:33.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes you,</v>

866
00:48:33.521 --> 00:48:36.730
<v Speaker 1>makes this explicit in passages that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>related to this one.</v>

867
00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:37.593
<v Speaker 1>He viewed the human being as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>collection of sub souls and the sub </v>

868
00:48:41.801 --> 00:48:42.634
<v Speaker 1>souls who are grounded in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence in Boston biological </v>

869
00:48:44.981 --> 00:48:45.814
<v Speaker 1>underpinnings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was the case for every human </v>

870
00:48:47.591 --> 00:48:48.424
<v Speaker 1>being in that made us roughly similar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It certainly made our groups roughly </v>

871
00:48:51.581 --> 00:48:54.340
<v Speaker 1>similar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so these,</v>

872
00:48:54.370 --> 00:48:55.203
<v Speaker 1>each of these biological subsystems </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualized as a sub soul was </v>

873
00:48:59.231 --> 00:49:01.780
<v Speaker 1>something that had its own viewpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had its own rules,</v>

874
00:49:01.781 --> 00:49:05.680
<v Speaker 1>it had its own games and they would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they jockey for precedence.</v>

875
00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:06.813
<v Speaker 1>Now you know that because sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're sitting there reading and you're </v>

876
00:49:09.341 --> 00:49:11.380
<v Speaker 1>trying to concentrate on a higher order </v>
<v Speaker 1>goal,</v>

877
00:49:11.381 --> 00:49:13.210
<v Speaker 1>like completing your classes and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

878
00:49:13.450 --> 00:49:18.220
<v Speaker 1>some biologically determined subsystem </v>
<v Speaker 1>pops up and says,</v>

879
00:49:18.221 --> 00:49:19.054
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this would be an excellent time to go </v>

880
00:49:20.231 --> 00:49:21.064
<v Speaker 1>have a coffee.</v>

881
00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:22.473
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you might do everything you can to </v>

882
00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:29.050
<v Speaker 1>not allow that thing to take over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But often it does.</v>

883
00:49:29.070 --> 00:49:33.910
<v Speaker 1>And often that's despite what you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>you might actually want to do.</v>

884
00:49:33.970 --> 00:49:37.990
<v Speaker 1>And then later you're all upset about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you've procrastinated yet again.</v>

885
00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:39.303
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature viewed the psyche as a place you </v>

886
00:49:42.611 --> 00:49:46.390
<v Speaker 1>could almost think of yourself as a set </v>
<v Speaker 1>of apps.</v>

887
00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:51.720
<v Speaker 1>It's like your brain is a set of animals</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the animals are all dependent on one</v>

888
00:49:52.871 --> 00:49:53.704
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But each animal needs to be boss from </v>

889
00:49:55.811 --> 00:49:56.644
<v Speaker 1>time to time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And each animal wants to be boss more </v>

890
00:49:59.321 --> 00:50:02.560
<v Speaker 1>often than it should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you know,</v>

891
00:50:02.561 --> 00:50:03.394
<v Speaker 1>the higher order cortical systems are </v>
<v Speaker 1>there to figure out how to sequence all </v>

892
00:50:07.121 --> 00:50:07.954
<v Speaker 1>of these other animals so that they all </v>
<v Speaker 1>get what they need without interfering </v>

893
00:50:11.561 --> 00:50:12.394
<v Speaker 1>with each other across large spans of </v>
<v Speaker 1>time in the presence of many other </v>

894
00:50:16.301 --> 00:50:18.700
<v Speaker 1>people in a manner that sustain.</v>

895
00:50:19.110 --> 00:50:20.920
<v Speaker 1>That's what very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very complicated.</v>

896
00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:22.413
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

897
00:50:23.050 --> 00:50:28.050
<v Speaker 1>so let's go back to the hierarch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have the hierarchy and overtime.</v>

898
00:50:29.690 --> 00:50:33.290
<v Speaker 1>Now remember this hierarchy stays there </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a very long period of time.</v>

899
00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:34.453
<v Speaker 1>And remember as well that the people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>climb to the top of the hierarchy are </v>

900
00:50:39.021 --> 00:50:41.690
<v Speaker 1>much more likely to leave offspring than</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people who don't.</v>

901
00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:43.273
<v Speaker 1>And so then what that means is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy in park is one of the primary </v>

902
00:50:47.751 --> 00:50:48.584
<v Speaker 1>selection forces operating on humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is that we evolve </v>

903
00:50:53.361 --> 00:50:58.361
<v Speaker 1>towards the thing that can most </v>
<v Speaker 1>successfully climb the dominance heart.</v>

904
00:50:59.390 --> 00:51:00.223
<v Speaker 1>And so that means that we evolved </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards the thing that has the best </v>

905
00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:08.560
<v Speaker 1>probability of ruling properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that that's not just cultural,</v>

906
00:51:09.530 --> 00:51:13.910
<v Speaker 1>it's cultural because it's the continual</v>
<v Speaker 1>interplay between cultural and biology.</v>

907
00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:18.740
<v Speaker 1>Going back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll say 400 million years or more.</v>

908
00:51:19.580 --> 00:51:20.061
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

909
00:51:20.061 --> 00:51:22.070
<v Speaker 1>but it's even more complicated than </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

910
00:51:22.730 --> 00:51:26.420
<v Speaker 1>And this is one of the things that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to understand if you really want to</v>

911
00:51:26.421 --> 00:51:29.390
<v Speaker 1>understand what needs you meant by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>death of God.</v>

912
00:51:29.391 --> 00:51:31.550
<v Speaker 1>So cause that's his most famous </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronouncement.</v>

913
00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:32.413
<v Speaker 1>God is dead and we have killed them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll never find enough water to wash </v>

914
00:51:34.671 --> 00:51:38.120
<v Speaker 1>away the blood now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he wasn't announcing that in triumph.</v>

915
00:51:38.390 --> 00:51:40.820
<v Speaker 1>He was announcing it in terror.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

916
00:51:40.821 --> 00:51:45.620
<v Speaker 1>now imagine this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as human society becomes more complex</v>

917
00:51:45.770 --> 00:51:46.603
<v Speaker 1>and as our brains become larger and </v>
<v Speaker 1>larger so that we could track larger </v>

918
00:51:49.551 --> 00:51:54.140
<v Speaker 1>social organizations and we can organize</v>
<v Speaker 1>more complex communities,</v>

919
00:51:55.580 --> 00:51:56.413
<v Speaker 1>what happens is that here to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for isolated tribes of people come </v>

920
00:52:00.501 --> 00:52:04.730
<v Speaker 1>together and then they have to engage in</v>
<v Speaker 1>conflict and negotiation.</v>

921
00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:09.800
<v Speaker 1>And partly what they're in conflict </v>
<v Speaker 1>about is what is the way that you should</v>

922
00:52:09.801 --> 00:52:10.634
<v Speaker 1>act and what should the values be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there's an old mythological idea </v>

923
00:52:15.021 --> 00:52:20.000
<v Speaker 1>that the gods fight in heaven to see who</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the dominant God.</v>

924
00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:23.240
<v Speaker 1>While you can imagine all of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual tribes,</v>

925
00:52:23.510 --> 00:52:28.510
<v Speaker 1>they had their ideals and those were </v>
<v Speaker 1>creatures of their imagination.</v>

926
00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:34.280
<v Speaker 1>But those were imagined representations </v>
<v Speaker 1>of proper behavioral patterns.</v>

927
00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:37.510
<v Speaker 1>And they saw there was this transcendent</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 super ordinate.</v>

928
00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:38.833
<v Speaker 1>And so then try bay would come into </v>
<v Speaker 1>contact with tried b and the guards </v>

929
00:52:42.321 --> 00:52:43.154
<v Speaker 1>would clash and out of that and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all the death and destruction that </v>

930
00:52:47.181 --> 00:52:49.100
<v Speaker 1>went with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the two tribes would integrate.</v>

931
00:52:49.101 --> 00:52:51.440
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that would take hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

932
00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:53.960
<v Speaker 1>And the religious system that sat above </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

933
00:52:53.961 --> 00:52:56.810
<v Speaker 1>which was the representation of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy,</v>

934
00:52:57.020 --> 00:52:59.090
<v Speaker 1>would also transform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you take,</v>

935
00:52:59.091 --> 00:52:59.924
<v Speaker 1>try bay and you take try b and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd take tried c and then you'd take </v>

936
00:53:02.481 --> 00:53:06.800
<v Speaker 1>tribe d and they all accumulate across </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and,</v>

937
00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:07.813
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sort out and articulate and </v>

938
00:53:10.521 --> 00:53:11.354
<v Speaker 1>represent all of their beliefs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what happens is that this tribe has </v>

939
00:53:16.221 --> 00:53:18.950
<v Speaker 1>a game and this tribe has a game in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>tribe has a game.</v>

940
00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:21.020
<v Speaker 1>And then if you put all those games </v>
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>

941
00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:22.430
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tilt.</v>

942
00:53:22.431 --> 00:53:25.210
<v Speaker 1>So that a metagame emerges out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

943
00:53:25.211 --> 00:53:27.150
<v Speaker 1>it's like if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's,</v>

944
00:53:27.151 --> 00:53:27.984
<v Speaker 1>if it's fortunate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best of all three games gets put </v>

945
00:53:30.091 --> 00:53:30.924
<v Speaker 1>together in a larger game and it has to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be the best because otherwise it won't </v>

946
00:53:34.261 --> 00:53:36.510
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing will fall apart.</v>

947
00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:37.970
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if,</v>

948
00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:40.470
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if your family unit isn't functional,</v>

949
00:53:41.310 --> 00:53:42.630
<v Speaker 1>it'll disperse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

950
00:53:42.631 --> 00:53:44.490
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe people will die because of it.</v>

951
00:53:44.910 --> 00:53:45.743
<v Speaker 1>It has to have the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has to be iterative and it has to be </v>

952
00:53:48.630 --> 00:53:52.860
<v Speaker 1>playable across time without falling </v>
<v Speaker 1>apart from internal pressure and without</v>

953
00:53:52.861 --> 00:53:54.450
<v Speaker 1>getting white belts from the health </v>
<v Speaker 1>side.</v>

954
00:53:54.451 --> 00:53:57.630
<v Speaker 1>So it's very tightly constrained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then I,</v>

955
00:53:57.640 --> 00:54:00.120
<v Speaker 1>let's say this happens over tens of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years,</v>

956
00:54:00.121 --> 00:54:02.820
<v Speaker 1>we could say what would happen in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Middle East because we know that it has,</v>

957
00:54:02.830 --> 00:54:04.950
<v Speaker 1>Mesopotamia came together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

958
00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:05.993
<v Speaker 1>it was the aggregation of multiple </v>
<v Speaker 1>tribes and all of the Gods of those </v>

959
00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:10.410
<v Speaker 1>tribes.</v>

960
00:54:10.410 --> 00:54:14.280
<v Speaker 1>And we know the Mesopotamians organized </v>
<v Speaker 1>all those gods into one God,</v>

961
00:54:14.310 --> 00:54:15.143
<v Speaker 1>his name was Marduk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that the story that they tell about </v>

962
00:54:18.211 --> 00:54:19.044
<v Speaker 1>the aggregation of the gods into one is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the story of the gods getting together </v>

963
00:54:24.090 --> 00:54:26.870
<v Speaker 1>and voting on which of them should be at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the top.</v>

964
00:54:27.810 --> 00:54:28.643
<v Speaker 1>And then we know that the Mesopotamian </v>
<v Speaker 1>emperor was charged with the </v>

965
00:54:32.581 --> 00:54:37.581
<v Speaker 1>responsibility of acting out that top </v>
<v Speaker 1>God and that that's what made him a good</v>

966
00:54:38.521 --> 00:54:39.354
<v Speaker 1>emperor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he got reminded of that every year </v>

967
00:54:41.161 --> 00:54:41.994
<v Speaker 1>at the new year's ceremony.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had to tell all the ways that he </v>

968
00:54:44.041 --> 00:54:47.520
<v Speaker 1>hadn't been a good Marduk and then he'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>get punished for it,</v>

969
00:54:47.820 --> 00:54:48.653
<v Speaker 1>and then they would reenact the battle </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the gods and recreate this martech </v>

970
00:54:51.241 --> 00:54:52.530
<v Speaker 1>character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

971
00:54:52.531 --> 00:54:53.364
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can understand how that might </v>

972
00:54:54.641 --> 00:54:55.474
<v Speaker 1>have come about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you could say that the idea of that </v>

973
00:54:58.741 --> 00:55:02.070
<v Speaker 1>emergent ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was not,</v>

974
00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:03.240
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't rational.</v>

975
00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:07.750
<v Speaker 1>It was the consequence of conflict and </v>
<v Speaker 1>cooperation in,</v>

976
00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:11.670
<v Speaker 1>in the real world across times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The representations of that were,</v>

977
00:55:12.060 --> 00:55:12.893
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we might think about them as narrative </v>

978
00:55:13.861 --> 00:55:15.690
<v Speaker 1>representations or if they're deep </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough,</v>

979
00:55:15.691 --> 00:55:18.420
<v Speaker 1>even as an anthology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can take about those as the,</v>

980
00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:22.050
<v Speaker 1>as the soil from which religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions emerge.</v>

981
00:55:22.650 --> 00:55:23.483
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens is that what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have at the top of the dominance </v>

982
00:55:26.671 --> 00:55:27.504
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy as your representation of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>good person is no different in its </v>

983
00:55:33.121 --> 00:55:33.954
<v Speaker 1>totality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the idea of the sovereign God that </v>

984
00:55:37.141 --> 00:55:40.710
<v Speaker 1>has emerged across thousands and </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years of human history.</v>

985
00:55:41.010 --> 00:55:41.843
<v Speaker 1>So the whole structure has this thing at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the top and it's regarded in </v>

986
00:55:45.811 --> 00:55:47.370
<v Speaker 1>imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has divine,</v>

987
00:55:47.850 --> 00:55:48.683
<v Speaker 1>it's the consequence of the represent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the consequence of the battle of </v>

988
00:55:52.561 --> 00:55:53.394
<v Speaker 1>representations of morality in </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagination across thousands and </v>

989
00:55:59.310 --> 00:56:00.143
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a reflection of the actual </v>

990
00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:05.010
<v Speaker 1>conflict and restructuring of societies </v>
<v Speaker 1>across all of that time.</v>

991
00:56:05.730 --> 00:56:08.850
<v Speaker 1>So then you have this thing at the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we could say in the West,</v>

992
00:56:08.851 --> 00:56:09.684
<v Speaker 1>in western Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing at the top is Christ and </v>

993
00:56:11.851 --> 00:56:16.851
<v Speaker 1>that's the dying and re re the dying and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the diamond revivified and hero.</v>

994
00:56:17.900 --> 00:56:18.733
<v Speaker 1>And we talked about reasons for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing that can go to the </v>

995
00:56:20.521 --> 00:56:22.800
<v Speaker 1>underworld and then come back up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

996
00:56:22.801 --> 00:56:26.800
<v Speaker 1>that's the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens when it disappears?</v>

997
00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:29.170
<v Speaker 1>What will turns Dostoyevsky for that?</v>

998
00:56:37.090 --> 00:56:37.923
<v Speaker 1>This is from notes from underground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is someone who's in the </v>

999
00:56:40.391 --> 00:56:43.840
<v Speaker 1>underground and that's where you go when</v>
<v Speaker 1>your value systems collapse.</v>

1000
00:56:44.050 --> 00:56:46.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm a sick man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a spiteful man.</v>

1001
00:56:47.350 --> 00:56:51.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm an unattractive man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe my liver is diseased.</v>

1002
00:56:51.790 --> 00:56:52.623
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know nothing at all about my disease </v>

1003
00:56:54.370 --> 00:56:56.560
<v Speaker 1>and do not know for certain what ails </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

1004
00:56:56.770 --> 00:56:59.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't consult the doctor for it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>never have.</v>

1005
00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:03.060
<v Speaker 1>Although I have a respect for medicine </v>
<v Speaker 1>than doctors you,</v>

1006
00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:03.913
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's I'm extremely superstitious </v>

1007
00:57:05.500 --> 00:57:08.290
<v Speaker 1>sufficiently so to respect medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

1008
00:57:08.740 --> 00:57:11.380
<v Speaker 1>I am well educated enough not to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>superstitious,</v>

1009
00:57:11.381 --> 00:57:13.360
<v Speaker 1>but I am superstitious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1010
00:57:13.361 --> 00:57:18.361
<v Speaker 1>I refuse to consult a doctor from spike </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you will probably not understand.</v>

1011
00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:21.370
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand that though.</v>

1012
00:57:22.450 --> 00:57:25.960
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't explain who it is precisely that</v>

1013
00:57:25.961 --> 00:57:28.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm more declining in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by my spite.</v>

1014
00:57:29.110 --> 00:57:29.943
<v Speaker 1>I'm perfectly well aware that I cannot </v>
<v Speaker 1>pay out the doctors and extract revenge </v>

1015
00:57:33.911 --> 00:57:35.320
<v Speaker 1>by not consulting them.</v>

1016
00:57:35.860 --> 00:57:39.220
<v Speaker 1>I know better than anyone that by all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this I'm only injuring myself and no one</v>

1017
00:57:39.221 --> 00:57:40.390
<v Speaker 1>else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still,</v>

1018
00:57:40.391 --> 00:57:43.150
<v Speaker 1>if I don't consult a doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's from spike.</v>

1019
00:57:43.690 --> 00:57:44.523
<v Speaker 1>My liver is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well let it get worse and he's a civil </v>

1020
00:57:48.671 --> 00:57:49.504
<v Speaker 1>servant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I low ranking civil servant and he's </v>

1021
00:57:53.921 --> 00:57:56.110
<v Speaker 1>retired because he got a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>inheritance.</v>

1022
00:57:56.890 --> 00:57:57.723
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when petitioners used to come for </v>

1023
00:57:59.771 --> 00:58:00.604
<v Speaker 1>information to the table at which I sat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to grind my teeth at them and I </v>

1024
00:58:06.071 --> 00:58:09.610
<v Speaker 1>felt intense enjoyment when I succeeded </v>
<v Speaker 1>in making anybody unhappy.</v>

1025
00:58:10.030 --> 00:58:13.720
<v Speaker 1>I almost always succeeded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For the most part.</v>

1026
00:58:13.721 --> 00:58:17.020
<v Speaker 1>They were all timid people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course they were petitioners,</v>

1027
00:58:17.860 --> 00:58:18.880
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gentleman,</v>

1028
00:58:18.881 --> 00:58:22.810
<v Speaker 1>what was the chief point about my spite?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1029
00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:25.390
<v Speaker 1>the whole point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real standard,</v>

1030
00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:26.273
<v Speaker 1>lay it in the fact that continually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even in the moment of the acutest </v>

1031
00:58:29.261 --> 00:58:32.740
<v Speaker 1>spleen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was inwardly conscious with shame that</v>

1032
00:58:32.741 --> 00:58:33.574
<v Speaker 1>I was not only not spiteful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not even embittered and that I was </v>

1033
00:58:37.721 --> 00:58:41.200
<v Speaker 1>simply scaring sparrows at random and </v>
<v Speaker 1>amusing myself by it.</v>

1034
00:58:43.270 --> 00:58:46.840
<v Speaker 1>I was lying when I just said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now that I was a spiteful officials,</v>

1035
00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:47.793
<v Speaker 1>I was lying from spike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was simply amusing myself with the </v>

1036
00:58:50.531 --> 00:58:54.940
<v Speaker 1>petitioners and with the officer and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality I never could become spiteful.</v>

1037
00:58:55.180 --> 00:58:59.710
<v Speaker 1>I was conscious every moment in myself </v>
<v Speaker 1>of many very many elements,</v>

1038
00:58:59.740 --> 00:59:00.573
<v Speaker 1>absolutely opposite to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt them positively swarming in me </v>

1039
00:59:04.750 --> 00:59:08.140
<v Speaker 1>these opposite elements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew that they had been swarming in me</v>

1040
00:59:08.170 --> 00:59:10.810
<v Speaker 1>my whole life and craving some outlet </v>
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>

1041
00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:15.460
<v Speaker 1>but I would not let them out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would not let them purposefully,</v>

1042
00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:20.200
<v Speaker 1>purposefully would not let them out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They tormented me until I was ashamed.</v>

1043
00:59:20.201 --> 00:59:25.070
<v Speaker 1>They drove me to convulsions and sick </v>
<v Speaker 1>and be at last at last.</v>

1044
00:59:25.071 --> 00:59:25.904
<v Speaker 1>How are they sick of me now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not fancying gentleman that I am </v>

1045
00:59:29.750 --> 00:59:33.500
<v Speaker 1>expressing remorse for something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that I'm asking your forgiveness for</v>

1046
00:59:33.501 --> 00:59:34.334
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you're fancying that however I </v>

1047
00:59:37.311 --> 00:59:38.144
<v Speaker 1>assure you I do not care if you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was not only that I could not become </v>

1048
00:59:42.321 --> 00:59:46.160
<v Speaker 1>spiteful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did not know how to become anything,</v>

1049
00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:50.900
<v Speaker 1>neither spiteful nor kind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neither a rascal nor an honest man,</v>

1050
00:59:51.770 --> 00:59:56.770
<v Speaker 1>neither hero nor an insect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm living my life out in my corner,</v>

1051
00:59:57.841 --> 00:59:58.674
<v Speaker 1>taunting myself with the spike bliss and</v>
<v Speaker 1>useless constellation that an </v>

1052
01:00:02.191 --> 01:00:03.024
<v Speaker 1>intelligent man can not become anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously and it's only the fool who </v>

1053
01:00:07.171 --> 01:00:08.010
<v Speaker 1>becomes anything.</v>

1054
01:00:13.770 --> 01:00:17.220
<v Speaker 1>A direct person I regard as the real </v>
<v Speaker 1>normal man</v>

1055
01:00:20.390 --> 01:00:24.650
<v Speaker 1>as his tender mother nature wish to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>him when she graciously brought him into</v>

1056
01:00:24.651 --> 01:00:25.484
<v Speaker 1>being on the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I envy such a man til I'm green in the </v>

1057
01:00:28.761 --> 01:00:30.680
<v Speaker 1>face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's stupid.</v>

1058
01:00:31.370 --> 01:00:32.203
<v Speaker 1>I'm not disputing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But perhaps the normal man should be </v>

1059
01:00:34.281 --> 01:00:35.020
<v Speaker 1>stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do,</v>

1060
01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:38.390
<v Speaker 1>how do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps it's very beautiful in fact,</v>

1061
01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:42.020
<v Speaker 1>and I am the more persuaded of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>suspicion,</v>

1062
01:00:42.380 --> 01:00:43.213
<v Speaker 1>if one can call it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So by the fact that you take for </v>

1063
01:00:44.901 --> 01:00:45.734
<v Speaker 1>instance the antithesis of the normal </v>
<v Speaker 1>man that is the man of acute </v>

1064
01:00:49.260 --> 01:00:52.970
<v Speaker 1>selfconsciousness who has come,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course not out of the lap of nature,</v>

1065
01:00:52.971 --> 01:00:54.960
<v Speaker 1>but out of a retort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

1066
01:00:54.961 --> 01:00:55.794
<v Speaker 1>this is also almost mysticism gentlemen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I suspect this to this retort made </v>

1067
01:01:00.171 --> 01:01:03.920
<v Speaker 1>man is sometimes so nonplussed in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>presence of his intense assists,</v>

1068
01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:07.940
<v Speaker 1>the normal man that with all his </v>
<v Speaker 1>exaggerated selfconsciousness,</v>

1069
01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:11.570
<v Speaker 1>he genuinely thinks of itself a mouse </v>
<v Speaker 1>and not a man at all.</v>

1070
01:01:12.620 --> 01:01:15.980
<v Speaker 1>It may be an acutely conscious miles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet it is a mouse.</v>

1071
01:01:16.310 --> 01:01:17.143
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other is a man and therefore et </v>

1072
01:01:19.421 --> 01:01:20.450
<v Speaker 1>Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

1073
01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:23.960
<v Speaker 1>And the worst of it is he himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his very own self,</v>

1074
01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:27.980
<v Speaker 1>looks on himself as a mouse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one asks him to do so.</v>

1075
01:01:28.730 --> 01:01:30.830
<v Speaker 1>And that's an important point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1076
01:01:30.831 --> 01:01:31.664
<v Speaker 1>let us look at this mouse in action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let us suppose for existence for </v>

1077
01:01:36.321 --> 01:01:40.340
<v Speaker 1>instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that feels insulted and it almost always</v>

1078
01:01:40.341 --> 01:01:43.790
<v Speaker 1>feels insulted and it wants to revenge </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself too.</v>

1079
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.840
<v Speaker 1>There may even be a greater of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cumulation of spite in it.</v>

1080
01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:48.913
<v Speaker 1>Then in the man of nature and truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the base and nasty desire to vent that </v>

1081
01:01:53.541 --> 01:01:54.374
<v Speaker 1>spite on it's a sale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It rankles perhaps even more nastily in </v>

1082
01:01:57.291 --> 01:02:02.291
<v Speaker 1>it than in the man of nature and truth </v>
<v Speaker 1>for through his innate stupidity,</v>

1083
01:02:02.690 --> 01:02:05.930
<v Speaker 1>the ladder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the normal man looks upon his revenge is</v>

1084
01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:07.520
<v Speaker 1>justice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pure and simple.</v>

1085
01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:10.880
<v Speaker 1>Well in consequences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his acute self consciousness,</v>

1086
01:02:10.881 --> 01:02:11.714
<v Speaker 1>the mouse does not believe in any </v>
<v Speaker 1>justice at all to come at last to the </v>

1087
01:02:15.231 --> 01:02:17.570
<v Speaker 1>deed itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the very act of revenge.</v>

1088
01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:21.630
<v Speaker 1>Apart from one the one fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>nastiness,</v>

1089
01:02:21.631 --> 01:02:23.910
<v Speaker 1>the luck with smiles succeeds in </v>
<v Speaker 1>creating around it.</v>

1090
01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:24.893
<v Speaker 1>So many other nastiness is in the form </v>
<v Speaker 1>of doubts and questions adds to the one </v>

1091
01:02:28.891 --> 01:02:29.724
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So many unsettled questions that there </v>

1092
01:02:31.891 --> 01:02:34.410
<v Speaker 1>are inevitably works around it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>up around it,</v>

1093
01:02:34.411 --> 01:02:38.880
<v Speaker 1>a sort of fatal brew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a stinking mess made up of it's doubts,</v>

1094
01:02:38.881 --> 01:02:39.714
<v Speaker 1>emotions and of the contempt spat upon </v>
<v Speaker 1>it by the direct men of action who </v>

1095
01:02:43.501 --> 01:02:48.180
<v Speaker 1>stands solemnly about it as judges and </v>
<v Speaker 1>arbitrators laughing at it until they're</v>

1096
01:02:48.181 --> 01:02:49.014
<v Speaker 1>healthy sides eight of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only thing left forward is to </v>

1097
01:02:53.401 --> 01:02:54.234
<v Speaker 1>dismiss all that with a wave of it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>Paul and with a smile of assumed </v>

1098
01:02:57.961 --> 01:02:58.794
<v Speaker 1>contempt in which it does not even </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself believe and creep ignominiously </v>

1099
01:03:03.030 --> 01:03:04.200
<v Speaker 1>into its mousehole.</v>

1100
01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:08.910
<v Speaker 1>There in its nasty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stinking underground home are insulted,</v>

1101
01:03:09.030 --> 01:03:13.920
<v Speaker 1>crushed and ridiculed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mouse promptly becomes absorbed in cold,</v>

1102
01:03:14.130 --> 01:03:14.963
<v Speaker 1>malignant and above all everlasting </v>
<v Speaker 1>spite for 40 years together it will </v>

1103
01:03:21.181 --> 01:03:22.014
<v Speaker 1>remember it's injury down to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>smallest most ignominious details and </v>

1104
01:03:26.071 --> 01:03:28.240
<v Speaker 1>every time we'll add,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've itself detailed,</v>

1105
01:03:28.241 --> 01:03:32.490
<v Speaker 1>still more in ignominious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spitefully teasing and tormenting itself</v>

1106
01:03:32.730 --> 01:03:37.730
<v Speaker 1>with its own imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will be ashamed of it's imaginings,</v>

1107
01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:40.920
<v Speaker 1>yet it will recall it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would go over and over every detail.</v>

1108
01:03:40.921 --> 01:03:43.470
<v Speaker 1>It will invent unheard of things against</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself,</v>

1109
01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:47.550
<v Speaker 1>pretending that those things might have </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened and will forgive nothing.</v>

1110
01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:52.050
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it will begin to revenge itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

1111
01:03:52.350 --> 01:03:53.183
<v Speaker 1>But as it were piecemeal in trivial ways</v>
<v Speaker 1>from behind the stove incognito without </v>

1112
01:03:59.101 --> 01:03:59.934
<v Speaker 1>believing either in its own right to </v>
<v Speaker 1>vengeance or in the success of its </v>

1113
01:04:02.851 --> 01:04:03.684
<v Speaker 1>revenge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing that from all its efforts at </v>

1114
01:04:05.161 --> 01:04:08.280
<v Speaker 1>revenge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will suffer a hundred times more than</v>

1115
01:04:08.281 --> 01:04:11.490
<v Speaker 1>he on whom it revenge is itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While he,</v>

1116
01:04:11.491 --> 01:04:16.260
<v Speaker 1>I daresay we'll not even scratch if self</v>
<v Speaker 1>on its deathbed,</v>

1117
01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:21.320
<v Speaker 1>it will recall it all over again with </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest accumulated over all the years</v>

1118
01:04:38.130 --> 01:04:38.963
<v Speaker 1>now</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that needs your dog's Kioski </v>

1119
01:04:42.490 --> 01:04:43.950
<v Speaker 1>were developing was that</v>

1120
01:04:46.350 --> 01:04:51.350
<v Speaker 1>the dawning consciousness in western </v>
<v Speaker 1>society of the mythological substructure</v>

1121
01:04:55.770 --> 01:05:00.770
<v Speaker 1>of the value system and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>impossibility of conceptualizing that or</v>

1122
01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:04.613
<v Speaker 1>proving the validity of it's structured </v>
<v Speaker 1>from scientific means doomed it to doom </v>

1123
01:05:11.921 --> 01:05:15.780
<v Speaker 1>the people who were encapsulated in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>system to formal disbelief in it.</v>

1124
01:05:16.890 --> 01:05:21.890
<v Speaker 1>And what they concluded from that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly what dos Dsd just described,</v>

1125
01:05:22.450 --> 01:05:23.283
<v Speaker 1>which is that someone with that level of</v>
<v Speaker 1>acute self consciousness and cultural </v>

1126
01:05:27.401 --> 01:05:31.840
<v Speaker 1>self knowledge would immediately come,</v>
<v Speaker 1>become fragmented to beyond belief,</v>

1127
01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:34.450
<v Speaker 1>unable to act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unhappy,</v>

1128
01:05:34.690 --> 01:05:35.523
<v Speaker 1>resentful and dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And both the Osteus in nature and in </v>

1129
01:05:40.031 --> 01:05:40.864
<v Speaker 1>their works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Dostoyevsky develop this idea most </v>

1130
01:05:42.701 --> 01:05:43.534
<v Speaker 1>particularly in a novel called the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Devil's said that once that you had got </v>

1131
01:05:46.781 --> 01:05:47.614
<v Speaker 1>to that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was inevitable if you were smart </v>

1132
01:05:49.961 --> 01:05:52.210
<v Speaker 1>enough to take seriously what was going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

1133
01:05:52.540 --> 01:05:53.373
<v Speaker 1>it was only a tiny step to </v>
<v Speaker 1>identification with a murderous </v>

1134
01:05:55.961 --> 01:05:56.794
<v Speaker 1>ideology.</v>

1135
01:06:00.260 --> 01:06:00.680
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1136
01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:01.513
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the existentialists started to </v>

1137
01:06:03.891 --> 01:06:07.790
<v Speaker 1>work up what you might regard as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>solution to this problem</v>

1138
01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:13.780
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to read,</v>

1139
01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:16.773
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1140
01:06:16.830 --> 01:06:17.840
<v Speaker 1>character guards</v>

1141
01:06:19.770 --> 01:06:20.603
<v Speaker 2>solution.</v>

1142
01:06:29.670 --> 01:06:33.960
<v Speaker 1>It is no cure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Character Guard was a Danish existential</v>

1143
01:06:33.961 --> 01:06:38.961
<v Speaker 1>philosopher and he lived earlier than </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature and he was in some sense,</v>

1144
01:06:39.661 --> 01:06:44.010
<v Speaker 1>you might think about him as the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>modern psychologist he was.</v>

1145
01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:45.900
<v Speaker 1>He was the first person to </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize,</v>

1146
01:06:45.901 --> 01:06:46.734
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the separate entity of anxiety and </v>

1147
01:06:49.681 --> 01:06:50.514
<v Speaker 1>despair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is now about four years ago that I </v>

1148
01:06:54.921 --> 01:06:57.320
<v Speaker 1>got the notion of wanting to try my luck</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an author.</v>

1149
01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:04.500
<v Speaker 1>I remember it quite clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was on a Sunday.</v>

1150
01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:05.950
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

1151
01:07:05.950 --> 01:07:06.783
<v Speaker 1>This Sunday afternoon I was seated as </v>
<v Speaker 1>usual out of doors at the cafe in the </v>

1152
01:07:11.700 --> 01:07:12.533
<v Speaker 1>Fredericksburg Garden.</v>

1153
01:07:14.070 --> 01:07:16.230
<v Speaker 1>I'd been a student for half a score of </v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

1154
01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:18.180
<v Speaker 1>although never lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All my activity.</v>

1155
01:07:18.210 --> 01:07:20.400
<v Speaker 1>Nevertheless was like a glittering </v>
<v Speaker 1>inactivity,</v>

1156
01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:21.633
<v Speaker 1>a kind of occupation for which I still </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a great partiality and for which I </v>

1157
01:07:24.571 --> 01:07:25.404
<v Speaker 1>perhaps even have a little genius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read much spent the remainder of the </v>

1158
01:07:29.910 --> 01:07:32.520
<v Speaker 1>day idling and thanking or or thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>and idling.</v>

1159
01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:33.773
<v Speaker 1>But that was all it came to soy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sat there and smoke my cigar until I </v>

1160
01:07:36.571 --> 01:07:39.840
<v Speaker 1>lapsed into thought among other </v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts.</v>

1161
01:07:40.260 --> 01:07:43.860
<v Speaker 1>I remember these</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are going on.</v>

1162
01:07:43.861 --> 01:07:47.190
<v Speaker 1>I said to myself to become an old man </v>
<v Speaker 1>without being anything in,</v>

1163
01:07:47.191 --> 01:07:49.080
<v Speaker 1>without really undertaking to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

1164
01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:54.060
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wherever you look around you in life and</v>

1165
01:07:54.061 --> 01:07:54.894
<v Speaker 1>in literature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see the celebrated names and </v>

1166
01:07:56.101 --> 01:07:56.934
<v Speaker 1>figures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the precious and much heralded men who </v>

1167
01:07:58.981 --> 01:07:59.814
<v Speaker 1>were coming into prominence and who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>much talked about the many benefactors </v>

1168
01:08:03.241 --> 01:08:04.074
<v Speaker 1>of the age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who know how to benefit mankind by </v>

1169
01:08:06.181 --> 01:08:07.680
<v Speaker 1>making life easier and easier.</v>

1170
01:08:07.830 --> 01:08:11.250
<v Speaker 1>Some by railways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>others by omnibuses and steamboats,</v>

1171
01:08:11.251 --> 01:08:15.270
<v Speaker 1>others by telegraph,</v>
<v Speaker 1>others by easily apprehended compendiums</v>

1172
01:08:15.290 --> 01:08:17.330
<v Speaker 1>and shortly cycles of everything worth </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing.</v>

1173
01:08:18.380 --> 01:08:19.213
<v Speaker 1>And finally the true benefactors of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>age who make spiritual existence easier </v>

1174
01:08:23.631 --> 01:08:25.460
<v Speaker 1>and easier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet more and more significant.</v>

1175
01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.660
<v Speaker 1>And what are you doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I soloed?</v>

1176
01:08:28.661 --> 01:08:29.494
<v Speaker 1>Khoi was interrupted for my cigar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was smoke gout and a new one had to be </v>

1177
01:08:32.001 --> 01:08:36.620
<v Speaker 1>lit so I smoked again and then suddenly </v>
<v Speaker 1>this thought flashed through my mind.</v>

1178
01:08:37.220 --> 01:08:38.053
<v Speaker 1>You must do something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in as much with your limited </v>

1179
01:08:41.151 --> 01:08:41.984
<v Speaker 1>capacities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will be impossible to make anything </v>

1180
01:08:43.521 --> 01:08:44.354
<v Speaker 1>easier than it has become.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You must with the same humanitarian </v>

1181
01:08:47.871 --> 01:08:52.700
<v Speaker 1>enthusiasm as the others undertake to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make something harder.</v>

1182
01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:56.000
<v Speaker 1>This notion please be immensely and at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same time,</v>

1183
01:08:56.001 --> 01:08:56.834
<v Speaker 1>it flattered me to think that I like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rest of them would be lovely and </v>

1184
01:08:59.751 --> 01:09:01.370
<v Speaker 1>esteemed by the whole community.</v>

1185
01:09:02.930 --> 01:09:03.590
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

1186
01:09:03.590 --> 01:09:06.200
<v Speaker 1>For when all combined in every way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make everything easier,</v>

1187
01:09:07.350 --> 01:09:08.183
<v Speaker 1>there remains only one possible danger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>namely that the ease become so great </v>

1188
01:09:12.501 --> 01:09:13.334
<v Speaker 1>that it becomes altogether too great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there is only one want left though </v>

1189
01:09:16.851 --> 01:09:17.684
<v Speaker 1>it is not yet felt want when people will</v>
<v Speaker 1>want difficulty out of love for mankind </v>

1190
01:09:22.511 --> 01:09:24.830
<v Speaker 1>and out of disparate my embarrassing </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>

1191
01:09:25.010 --> 01:09:25.843
<v Speaker 1>seeing that I had accomplished nothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and was unable to make anything easier </v>

1192
01:09:28.911 --> 01:09:33.911
<v Speaker 1>than it already was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and moved by a genuine interest in those</v>

1193
01:09:34.521 --> 01:09:35.354
<v Speaker 1>who make everything easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can see that as my task to create </v>

1194
01:09:39.860 --> 01:09:41.510
<v Speaker 1>difficulties everywhere.</v>

1195
01:09:51.860 --> 01:09:54.470
<v Speaker 1>Same idea in different words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a traveler,</v>

1196
01:09:54.471 --> 01:09:55.304
<v Speaker 1>this is Nicha and this is part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>development of his answer to the </v>

1197
01:09:57.891 --> 01:09:58.724
<v Speaker 1>conundrum that he raised.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A traveler who had seen many countries </v>

1198
01:10:02.211 --> 01:10:03.044
<v Speaker 1>and peoples and several continents was </v>
<v Speaker 1>asked what human traits he had found </v>

1199
01:10:05.301 --> 01:10:08.630
<v Speaker 1>everywhere and he answered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men Are inclined to laziness.</v>

1200
01:10:08.990 --> 01:10:11.480
<v Speaker 1>Some will feel that he might have said </v>
<v Speaker 1>with greater justice,</v>

1201
01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:14.530
<v Speaker 1>they were all timid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They hide behind customs,</v>

1202
01:10:14.540 --> 01:10:17.780
<v Speaker 1>end opinions</v>
<v Speaker 1>at bottom.</v>

1203
01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:18.673
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every human being knows very well that </v>

1204
01:10:20.631 --> 01:10:25.460
<v Speaker 1>he is in this world just once as </v>
<v Speaker 1>something unique and no accident,</v>

1205
01:10:25.700 --> 01:10:30.230
<v Speaker 1>however strange we'll throw together a </v>
<v Speaker 1>second time into a unity,</v>

1206
01:10:30.590 --> 01:10:33.950
<v Speaker 1>such a curious and diffuse plurality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knows it,</v>

1207
01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:38.930
<v Speaker 1>but he hides it like a bad conscience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1208
01:10:41.650 --> 01:10:45.200
<v Speaker 1>From fear of his neighbor who insists on</v>
<v Speaker 1>convention and veils himself with it.</v>

1209
01:10:46.250 --> 01:10:47.083
<v Speaker 1>But what is it that compels the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual human being to fear his </v>

1210
01:10:48.981 --> 01:10:53.120
<v Speaker 1>neighbor and to think and act heard </v>
<v Speaker 1>fashion and not to be glad of himself?</v>

1211
01:10:54.070 --> 01:10:57.710
<v Speaker 1>A sense of shame perhaps in a few rare </v>
<v Speaker 1>cases in the vast majority,</v>

1212
01:10:57.711 --> 01:11:02.711
<v Speaker 1>it's the desire for comfort and inertia </v>
<v Speaker 1>and short dot inclination to laziness of</v>

1213
01:11:03.171 --> 01:11:05.990
<v Speaker 1>which the traveler spoke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's right.</v>

1214
01:11:06.380 --> 01:11:07.213
<v Speaker 1>Men are even lazier than they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>timorous and what they fear most is the </v>

1215
01:11:10.161 --> 01:11:14.040
<v Speaker 1>troubles with which any unconditional </v>
<v Speaker 1>honesty and nudity would burden them.</v>

1216
01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:15.353
<v Speaker 1>Only artists hate this slovenly life in </v>
<v Speaker 1>borrowed manners and loosely fitting </v>

1217
01:11:19.471 --> 01:11:23.790
<v Speaker 1>opinions and unveiled the secret.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's bad conscience.</v>

1218
01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:27.330
<v Speaker 1>The principle that every human being is </v>
<v Speaker 1>a unique wonder.</v>

1219
01:11:27.450 --> 01:11:28.283
<v Speaker 1>They dare to show us the human being as </v>
<v Speaker 1>he is down to the last muscle himself </v>

1220
01:11:31.411 --> 01:11:32.244
<v Speaker 1>and himself alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even more that in this rigorous </v>

1221
01:11:35.761 --> 01:11:36.594
<v Speaker 1>consistency of his uniqueness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he is beautiful and worth contemplating </v>

1222
01:11:39.810 --> 01:11:42.780
<v Speaker 1>as novel and as incredible as any work </v>
<v Speaker 1>of nature.</v>

1223
01:11:43.050 --> 01:11:48.050
<v Speaker 1>And by no means dope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When a great thinker despises man,</v>

1224
01:11:48.590 --> 01:11:52.310
<v Speaker 1>it's their laziness that he despises for</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is on account of this.</v>

1225
01:11:52.311 --> 01:11:53.144
<v Speaker 1>That they have the periods of factory </v>
<v Speaker 1>products and seeing indifferent and </v>

1226
01:11:56.121 --> 01:11:58.520
<v Speaker 1>unworthy of companionship or </v>
<v Speaker 1>instruction.</v>

1227
01:12:00.610 --> 01:12:01.443
<v Speaker 1>The human being who does not wish to </v>
<v Speaker 1>belong to the mass austerely seeds must </v>

1228
01:12:05.781 --> 01:12:08.600
<v Speaker 1>merely cease being comfortable with </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>

1229
01:12:10.310 --> 01:12:12.920
<v Speaker 1>Let him follow his conscience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which shouts at them.</v>

1230
01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:17.000
<v Speaker 1>Be Yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you are at present,</v>

1231
01:12:17.001 --> 01:12:19.160
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>opining,</v>

1232
01:12:19.490 --> 01:12:20.510
<v Speaker 1>and desiring.</v>

1233
01:12:23.460 --> 01:12:24.600
<v Speaker 1>That's not really you.</v>

1234
01:12:32.810 --> 01:12:33.643
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1235
01:12:35.850 --> 01:12:36.683
<v Speaker 1>That's neat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nietzsche and Dostoyevsky and </v>

1236
01:12:38.370 --> 01:12:43.370
<v Speaker 1>existentialism in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the bare beginning of the thing.</v>

1237
01:12:43.910 --> 01:12:44.743
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
