1
00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:01.300
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2
00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:16.760
<v Speaker 2>this is the most practical of all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that we've discussed so far.</v>

3
00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.880
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really,</v>

4
00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.240
<v Speaker 2>you could consider it a component of </v>
<v Speaker 2>industrial organizational psychology,</v>

5
00:00:25.241 --> 00:00:26.074
<v Speaker 2>but it's a component that has a strong </v>
<v Speaker 2>emphasis on individual differences and </v>

6
00:00:30.461 --> 00:00:31.294
<v Speaker 2>so you could consider it</v>
<v Speaker 2>first an exploration of the practical </v>

7
00:00:39.691 --> 00:00:44.010
<v Speaker 2>utility of psychological concepts in </v>
<v Speaker 2>predicting real world phenomena,</v>

8
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.053
<v Speaker 2>but you could also consider it a part of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the validation of the psychometric </v>

9
00:00:48.661 --> 00:00:51.720
<v Speaker 2>models of personality that we've </v>
<v Speaker 2>described because one of the things that</v>

10
00:00:51.721 --> 00:00:55.380
<v Speaker 2>you want to do to determine whether or </v>
<v Speaker 2>not a construct.</v>

11
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:56.303
<v Speaker 2>So what's a hypothetic hypothetical </v>
<v Speaker 2>social psychological phenomena or </v>

12
00:01:00.211 --> 00:01:01.044
<v Speaker 2>entity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether or not that's real depends to </v>

13
00:01:04.171 --> 00:01:08.450
<v Speaker 2>some degree on what it's good for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

14
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.000
<v Speaker 2>Part of the aim of science is prediction</v>
<v Speaker 2>and control and so</v>

15
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:15.653
<v Speaker 2>it's useful to take a look at important </v>
<v Speaker 2>life outcomes among human beings and to </v>

16
00:01:20.071 --> 00:01:20.904
<v Speaker 2>determine whether or not you can predict</v>
<v Speaker 2>that because that's one way of testing </v>

17
00:01:24.391 --> 00:01:25.224
<v Speaker 2>whether or not the phenomena that you've</v>
<v Speaker 2>derived say from your statistical </v>

18
00:01:29.131 --> 00:01:29.964
<v Speaker 2>analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both in the case of fluid intelligence </v>

19
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.880
<v Speaker 2>or intelligence more broadly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in the case of the big five actually</v>

20
00:01:35.881 --> 00:01:36.714
<v Speaker 2>has the capacity to manifest itself in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaningful way in the world outside of </v>

21
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.893
<v Speaker 2>inside the lab.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one domain of potential </v>

22
00:01:44.371 --> 00:01:46.950
<v Speaker 2>validation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then outside the lab as well.</v>

23
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.993
<v Speaker 2>And so what we're going to do today is </v>
<v Speaker 2>to look at the factors that determine </v>

24
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.190
<v Speaker 2>performance in the real world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you might think,</v>

25
00:01:56.191 --> 00:01:57.024
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are some important real world </v>

26
00:01:58.441 --> 00:02:00.810
<v Speaker 2>outcomes on which performance might </v>
<v Speaker 2>vary?</v>

27
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.460
<v Speaker 2>And we're going to stick to those that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are rather obvious today.</v>

28
00:02:05.461 --> 00:02:09.030
<v Speaker 2>We talked about creative achievement </v>
<v Speaker 2>already for example,</v>

29
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.710
<v Speaker 2>but you could think of creative </v>
<v Speaker 2>achievement,</v>

30
00:02:10.711 --> 00:02:14.370
<v Speaker 2>entrepreneurial achievement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those actually clumped together.</v>

31
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.540
<v Speaker 2>They're part of the same phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think about academic achievement and</v>

32
00:02:18.541 --> 00:02:19.374
<v Speaker 2>you could think about success in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>workplace and then those can be </v>

33
00:02:22.651 --> 00:02:25.260
<v Speaker 2>subdivided because success in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>workplace for example,</v>

34
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.630
<v Speaker 2>needs to be analyzed in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>success.</v>

35
00:02:27.631 --> 00:02:30.780
<v Speaker 2>Say at simple jobs in success at complex</v>
<v Speaker 2>jobs you'd like.</v>

36
00:02:30.781 --> 00:02:31.614
<v Speaker 2>There's different ways of fractioning </v>
<v Speaker 2>fractionating a phenomena to increase </v>

37
00:02:35.701 --> 00:02:36.534
<v Speaker 2>your capacity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to understand it and to measure it and </v>

38
00:02:39.151 --> 00:02:39.984
<v Speaker 2>then to predict it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But those are rough domains where </v>

39
00:02:42.271 --> 00:02:45.000
<v Speaker 2>there's self evident individual </v>
<v Speaker 2>differences.</v>

40
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.013
<v Speaker 2>And where the capacity to predict </v>
<v Speaker 2>performance would at least be of some </v>

41
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.560
<v Speaker 2>utility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a performance in the workplace.</v>

42
00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.370
<v Speaker 2>This is an interesting one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Performance in the workplace is a tricky</v>

43
00:02:56.371 --> 00:02:58.110
<v Speaker 2>measure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A tricky issue.</v>

44
00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.460
<v Speaker 2>I've been working on performance </v>
<v Speaker 2>prediction tests for a long time because</v>

45
00:03:03.461 --> 00:03:04.294
<v Speaker 2>I was interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm a clinical psychologist and </v>

46
00:03:05.981 --> 00:03:10.981
<v Speaker 2>because I have a practical side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm often interested in what the utility</v>

47
00:03:11.201 --> 00:03:14.380
<v Speaker 2>of psychological measurements might be </v>
<v Speaker 2>outside the lab.</v>

48
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.250
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting to consider that from </v>
<v Speaker 2>an ethical perspective too.</v>

49
00:03:18.251 --> 00:03:21.400
<v Speaker 2>So if you're hiring people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have</v>

50
00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:23.803
<v Speaker 2>to conundrums that lay themselves in </v>
<v Speaker 2>front of you and one is the ethical </v>

51
00:03:28.331 --> 00:03:30.700
<v Speaker 2>necessity to give each person a fair </v>
<v Speaker 2>chance.</v>

52
00:03:30.701 --> 00:03:34.660
<v Speaker 2>And the other is the ethical necessity </v>
<v Speaker 2>to place the proper person in the proper</v>

53
00:03:34.661 --> 00:03:36.610
<v Speaker 2>position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you might say,</v>

54
00:03:36.611 --> 00:03:37.444
<v Speaker 2>well you could do that randomly and like</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are countries in Europe for </v>

55
00:03:40.691 --> 00:03:43.540
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that have a quasi random approach to the</v>

56
00:03:43.541 --> 00:03:46.030
<v Speaker 2>selection of university students.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Holland just like that,</v>

57
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.570
<v Speaker 2>they have a pretty open admission </v>
<v Speaker 2>policy.</v>

58
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.003
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what that means is that everyone has a </v>

59
00:03:52.961 --> 00:03:53.794
<v Speaker 2>chance to go to college,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the downside of it is that the </v>

60
00:03:56.381 --> 00:03:58.180
<v Speaker 2>failure rate in the first year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

61
00:03:58.181 --> 00:03:59.014
<v Speaker 2>is extraordinarily high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you might say that's a perfectly </v>

62
00:04:01.811 --> 00:04:02.644
<v Speaker 2>reasonable price to pay for the open </v>
<v Speaker 2>admission and for the opportunity to </v>

63
00:04:05.321 --> 00:04:07.420
<v Speaker 2>give everyone a chance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you could also say,</v>

64
00:04:07.421 --> 00:04:09.820
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a hell of a waste of time for the</v>

65
00:04:09.821 --> 00:04:13.720
<v Speaker 2>people who go into the first year of </v>
<v Speaker 2>college or university and fail.</v>

66
00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:14.643
<v Speaker 2>It's not a pleasant experience for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very expensive in terms of time </v>

67
00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.113
<v Speaker 2>and resources and perhaps it would have </v>
<v Speaker 2>been better for them and for broader </v>

68
00:04:21.791 --> 00:04:24.670
<v Speaker 2>society had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd been able to determine beforehand</v>

69
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:25.743
<v Speaker 2>whether they had two sets of qualities </v>
<v Speaker 2>that were necessary to increase the </v>

70
00:04:30.611 --> 00:04:32.650
<v Speaker 2>probability of success.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if I could tell you,</v>

71
00:04:32.651 --> 00:04:33.640
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

72
00:04:33.641 --> 00:04:34.474
<v Speaker 2>you have a 80 percent chance of success </v>
<v Speaker 2>in this domain and only a 20 percent </v>

73
00:04:37.751 --> 00:04:41.170
<v Speaker 2>chance in this domain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You still might want to take the risk in</v>

74
00:04:41.171 --> 00:04:44.890
<v Speaker 2>the 20 percent success domain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you might also think,</v>

75
00:04:44.891 --> 00:04:45.724
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might as well go off and function </v>

76
00:04:47.921 --> 00:04:52.720
<v Speaker 2>where my particular combination of </v>
<v Speaker 2>proclivities has the best opportunity to</v>

77
00:04:52.721 --> 00:04:54.130
<v Speaker 2>manifest itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

78
00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.730
<v Speaker 2>and because why not position yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>for success rather than failure?</v>

79
00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:58.743
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that the ethical </v>

80
00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.190
<v Speaker 2>conundrum between those two alternatives</v>
<v Speaker 2>is something that's easy to,</v>

81
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.103
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you say an easy thing to map </v>

82
00:05:09.791 --> 00:05:10.420
<v Speaker 2>your way through.</v>

83
00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:11.253
<v Speaker 2>It's by no means an easy way to map your</v>
<v Speaker 2>way through because there are strong </v>

84
00:05:14.081 --> 00:05:16.210
<v Speaker 2>arguments to be had on both sides of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>equation,</v>

85
00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:17.920
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

86
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.110
<v Speaker 2>there's still the scientific question </v>
<v Speaker 2>that remains,</v>

87
00:05:23.111 --> 00:05:23.944
<v Speaker 2>which is to what degree can you </v>
<v Speaker 2>accurately predict people's performance </v>

88
00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:27.573
<v Speaker 2>and to what degree does that reflect </v>
<v Speaker 2>positively or negatively on your </v>

89
00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:31.743
<v Speaker 2>psychological concepts?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's the actual practical </v>

90
00:05:34.601 --> 00:05:37.720
<v Speaker 2>utility of potentially offering to </v>
<v Speaker 2>schools,</v>

91
00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:38.643
<v Speaker 2>to universities and to workplaces in </v>
<v Speaker 2>general the probability of selecting </v>

92
00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.100
<v Speaker 2>people with an above average chance of </v>
<v Speaker 2>succeeding.</v>

93
00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:46.113
<v Speaker 2>It's even more complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say if you're selecting not so much </v>

94
00:05:48.581 --> 00:05:52.420
<v Speaker 2>entry level employees in a company </v>
<v Speaker 2>because maybe you tell yourself they are</v>

95
00:05:52.421 --> 00:05:53.254
<v Speaker 2>more towards the possibility of bringing</v>
<v Speaker 2>more people in and letting them fail or </v>

96
00:05:56.681 --> 00:05:57.514
<v Speaker 2>succeed in the job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's say you're replacing a </v>

97
00:05:59.841 --> 00:06:03.200
<v Speaker 2>management team at a medium to large </v>
<v Speaker 2>size corporation.</v>

98
00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.050
<v Speaker 2>You know if you bring in managers that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are in competent,</v>

99
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.973
<v Speaker 2>not only are they going to fail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is obviously not very good for </v>

100
00:06:08.961 --> 00:06:09.794
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the failure rate among managers is </v>

101
00:06:10.821 --> 00:06:11.654
<v Speaker 2>very high.</v>

102
00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.700
<v Speaker 2>It exceeds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It exceeds 65.</v>

103
00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.760
<v Speaker 2>I figure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's 65 percent of managers.</v>

104
00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:17.653
<v Speaker 2>I believe that's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Add zero or negative net value to the </v>

105
00:06:20.811 --> 00:06:22.370
<v Speaker 2>companies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that.</v>

106
00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:23.443
<v Speaker 2>The failure rate in managerial positions</v>
<v Speaker 2>is overwhelming and the problem with </v>

107
00:06:26.781 --> 00:06:30.140
<v Speaker 2>bringing someone into a managerial or an</v>
<v Speaker 2>executive position even worse,</v>

108
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:31.123
<v Speaker 2>who isn't competent to play that role is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they can wipe out the careers of </v>

109
00:06:34.401 --> 00:06:37.160
<v Speaker 2>everyone that they're supervising.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in the case of say,</v>

110
00:06:37.161 --> 00:06:37.994
<v Speaker 2>large companies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can bring the whole damn company </v>

111
00:06:38.901 --> 00:06:39.734
<v Speaker 2>down and so it's not like the the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ethic of people deserve an equal </v>

112
00:06:44.991 --> 00:06:45.860
<v Speaker 2>chance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

113
00:06:45.861 --> 00:06:48.410
<v Speaker 2>to fail and succeed isn't a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>practical ethic.</v>

114
00:06:48.411 --> 00:06:49.244
<v Speaker 2>When you're putting someone in a high </v>
<v Speaker 2>demand position where the consequences </v>

115
00:06:52.671 --> 00:06:56.630
<v Speaker 2>of failure are can be overwhelming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only for that person but for all the</v>

116
00:06:56.631 --> 00:06:57.464
<v Speaker 2>people that they happen to be whose </v>
<v Speaker 2>destiny they happen to be involved in </v>

117
00:07:01.851 --> 00:07:02.480
<v Speaker 2>determining.</v>

118
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.313
<v Speaker 2>And so then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you could come up with a selection </v>

119
00:07:05.571 --> 00:07:06.404
<v Speaker 2>process that would increase the </v>
<v Speaker 2>probability of hiring and above average </v>

120
00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:13.280
<v Speaker 2>manager from 50 slash 50 to 60 slash 40 </v>
<v Speaker 2>or 70 slash 30.</v>

121
00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:16.010
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you're actually ethically </v>
<v Speaker 2>compelled to use that.</v>

122
00:07:16.011 --> 00:07:17.600
<v Speaker 2>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by law,</v>

123
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.670
<v Speaker 2>this is particularly the case in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>United States.</v>

124
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.660
<v Speaker 2>You're required by law to use the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>effective,</v>

125
00:07:23.661 --> 00:07:27.770
<v Speaker 2>valid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reliable and nondiscriminatory selection</v>

126
00:07:27.771 --> 00:07:31.940
<v Speaker 2>process that currently exists in order </v>
<v Speaker 2>to select your employees.</v>

127
00:07:31.941 --> 00:07:35.450
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen to employers in the next 10 years</v>

128
00:07:35.451 --> 00:07:38.450
<v Speaker 2>is they're going to get a very nasty </v>
<v Speaker 2>shock for using interviews.</v>

129
00:07:38.451 --> 00:07:39.284
<v Speaker 2>Because the data on unstructured </v>
<v Speaker 2>interviews indicates quite clearly that </v>

130
00:07:42.381 --> 00:07:44.150
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're discriminatory,</v>

131
00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:46.460
<v Speaker 2>partly because they they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

132
00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:52.240
<v Speaker 2>if you're tall and assertive and good </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking and charming,</v>

133
00:07:52.701 --> 00:07:55.550
<v Speaker 2>then you're much more likely to do well </v>
<v Speaker 2>in an interview,</v>

134
00:07:55.551 --> 00:07:56.384
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't necessarily have any </v>
<v Speaker 2>bearing whatsoever on the probability </v>

135
00:07:59.181 --> 00:08:03.260
<v Speaker 2>that you'll succeed in the position and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so and not only that,</v>

136
00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:07.580
<v Speaker 2>the predictive validity of unstructured </v>
<v Speaker 2>interviews is very low.</v>

137
00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:08.810
<v Speaker 2>It's about point one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two.</v>

138
00:08:08.811 --> 00:08:09.644
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that which means </v>
<v Speaker 2>that if you just pick people randomly </v>

139
00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:13.453
<v Speaker 2>for success or failure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say you'd have a 50 slash 50 </v>

140
00:08:15.261 --> 00:08:18.290
<v Speaker 2>chance of predicting whether someone was</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be a success or a failure.</v>

141
00:08:18.291 --> 00:08:21.200
<v Speaker 2>It's just a coin toss and then if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>used an unstructured interview,</v>

142
00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.660
<v Speaker 2>you'd get that up to 56,</v>
<v Speaker 2>44,</v>

143
00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:27.110
<v Speaker 2>which is slightly better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's by no means it's not even close</v>

144
00:08:27.111 --> 00:08:29.570
<v Speaker 2>to the accuracy that you could get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

145
00:08:29.571 --> 00:08:31.880
<v Speaker 2>if you just use the standard test of </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness,</v>

146
00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:32.953
<v Speaker 2>which would give you a correlation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>about point two five with with say </v>

147
00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:41.800
<v Speaker 2>managerial with managerial productivity </v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's this interesting.</v>

148
00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:44.960
<v Speaker 2>This is an interesting thing to know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called the binomial effect size,</v>

149
00:08:44.961 --> 00:08:48.440
<v Speaker 2>display effect size is the magnitude of </v>
<v Speaker 2>an effect,</v>

150
00:08:48.441 --> 00:08:49.274
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and and it's not an easy thing to get a </v>

151
00:08:50.661 --> 00:08:53.330
<v Speaker 2>handle on all that you really need to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to be a psychologist,</v>

152
00:08:53.331 --> 00:08:54.164
<v Speaker 2>because in any study there is an effect </v>
<v Speaker 2>size indicator correlation off often or </v>

153
00:08:58.831 --> 00:08:59.664
<v Speaker 2>an r squared,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the correlation squared or a </v>

154
00:09:00.841 --> 00:09:01.674
<v Speaker 2>Cohen's d,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which has the effect size expressed in </v>

155
00:09:04.021 --> 00:09:05.040
<v Speaker 2>standard deviation.</v>

156
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:05.873
<v Speaker 2>So something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you kind of have to understand that </v>

157
00:09:08.221 --> 00:09:11.310
<v Speaker 2>at a basic level to understand what </v>
<v Speaker 2>statistics actually do.</v>

158
00:09:11.311 --> 00:09:12.144
<v Speaker 2>And there's this phenomena called the </v>
<v Speaker 2>binomial effect size display that can </v>

159
00:09:15.391 --> 00:09:16.224
<v Speaker 2>help you understand in an embodied sense</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the magnitude of a correlation </v>

160
00:09:21.241 --> 00:09:22.830
<v Speaker 2>means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's how it works.</v>

161
00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:26.700
<v Speaker 2>Imagine that you have a predictor of </v>
<v Speaker 2>point two zero.</v>

162
00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:31.650
<v Speaker 2>So the correlation is r equals point two</v>
<v Speaker 2>zero between phenomena.</v>

163
00:09:31.651 --> 00:09:33.840
<v Speaker 2>One will say conscientiousness and </v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomena,</v>

164
00:09:33.841 --> 00:09:36.060
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>workplace performance point two,</v>

165
00:09:36.061 --> 00:09:38.250
<v Speaker 2>zero correlation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question might be,</v>

166
00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:42.180
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much?</v>

167
00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:43.763
<v Speaker 2>How much would you improve your </v>
<v Speaker 2>predictive capacity over chance levels </v>

168
00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:48.893
<v Speaker 2>if you applied that predictor?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the answer is that the ar is the </v>

169
00:09:52.411 --> 00:09:55.050
<v Speaker 2>difference between the odds ratio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let me explain that.</v>

170
00:09:55.051 --> 00:09:57.790
<v Speaker 2>So point five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>zero point five zero.</v>

171
00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:00.150
<v Speaker 2>If you subtract one from the other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get zero.</v>

172
00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:04.440
<v Speaker 2>So the predictive validity of selection </v>
<v Speaker 2>by chance is zero point five,</v>

173
00:10:04.441 --> 00:10:06.960
<v Speaker 2>zero minus point five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>zero equals zero.</v>

174
00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:09.480
<v Speaker 2>That's the predictive validity of </v>
<v Speaker 2>chance.</v>

175
00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:12.840
<v Speaker 2>If you have a predictor of point two </v>
<v Speaker 2>zero,</v>

176
00:10:12.841 --> 00:10:13.674
<v Speaker 2>which is approximately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's sort of the low end estimate for </v>

177
00:10:15.541 --> 00:10:16.374
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that would change your odds ratio </v>

178
00:10:18.931 --> 00:10:21.300
<v Speaker 2>from point five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>zero point five zero,</v>

179
00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:22.590
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Random two,</v>

180
00:10:22.591 --> 00:10:23.424
<v Speaker 2>point six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>zero point four zero because point six </v>

181
00:10:25.351 --> 00:10:28.020
<v Speaker 2>zero minus point four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>zero point two zero.</v>

182
00:10:28.021 --> 00:10:28.854
<v Speaker 2>And so the correlation coefficient turns</v>
<v Speaker 2>out to be the difference between the </v>

183
00:10:33.391 --> 00:10:34.224
<v Speaker 2>odds between the odds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So and so it gives you a quick rule of </v>

184
00:10:37.291 --> 00:10:38.400
<v Speaker 2>thumb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

185
00:10:38.401 --> 00:10:41.730
<v Speaker 2>so if you have a point two zero </v>
<v Speaker 2>predictor that gives you 60 slash 40,</v>

186
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:43.830
<v Speaker 2>if you have a point three zero </v>
<v Speaker 2>predictor,</v>

187
00:10:43.831 --> 00:10:46.680
<v Speaker 2>that gives you 60 5:35 because point </v>
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>

188
00:10:46.681 --> 00:10:49.020
<v Speaker 2>five minus point three five is point </v>
<v Speaker 2>three zero.</v>

189
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:53.970
<v Speaker 2>And if you have a point six predictor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really up on the high end,</v>

190
00:10:53.971 --> 00:10:54.804
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're really starting to push your </v>

191
00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:59.010
<v Speaker 2>limits of statistical predict prediction</v>
<v Speaker 2>validity at that point.</v>

192
00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:01.500
<v Speaker 2>That gives you a point eight zero minus </v>
<v Speaker 2>point two zero.</v>

193
00:11:01.501 --> 00:11:02.334
<v Speaker 2>And so what you've done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you use a predictive of a predictor </v>

194
00:11:05.611 --> 00:11:07.860
<v Speaker 2>that has a correlation Coefficient of </v>
<v Speaker 2>point six zero,</v>

195
00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:09.480
<v Speaker 2>which you could get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

196
00:11:09.481 --> 00:11:13.590
<v Speaker 2>if you took conscientiousness and </v>
<v Speaker 2>combined that with a good test of Iq for</v>

197
00:11:13.591 --> 00:11:16.290
<v Speaker 2>predicting complex jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might be able to get up to point six</v>

198
00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:21.090
<v Speaker 2>that moves your odds ratio of selecting </v>
<v Speaker 2>an above average person for the position</v>

199
00:11:21.091 --> 00:11:22.860
<v Speaker 2>from point five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>zero point five,</v>

200
00:11:22.861 --> 00:11:25.350
<v Speaker 2>zero two point eight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>zero point two zero.</v>

201
00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:28.530
<v Speaker 2>So it cuts your failure rate by more </v>
<v Speaker 2>than half,</v>

202
00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:30.050
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brings it down from point five,</v>

203
00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:30.930
<v Speaker 2>zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Point two zero,</v>

204
00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:33.330
<v Speaker 2>because point eight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>zero minus point two,</v>

205
00:11:33.331 --> 00:11:36.120
<v Speaker 2>zero point six zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a really good thing to know.</v>

206
00:11:36.121 --> 00:11:38.010
<v Speaker 2>That's called the binomial effect size </v>
<v Speaker 2>display.</v>

207
00:11:38.011 --> 00:11:39.510
<v Speaker 2>It's really good thing to have in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>mind.</v>

208
00:11:39.511 --> 00:11:40.230
<v Speaker 2>It's very simple.</v>

209
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:41.063
<v Speaker 2>It's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just subtraction and it gives you </v>

210
00:11:43.231 --> 00:11:45.720
<v Speaker 2>some sense of the power of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

211
00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:49.620
<v Speaker 2>of statistical prediction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the question might be,</v>

212
00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:50.663
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say you had a predictor of point </v>

213
00:11:51.611 --> 00:11:53.830
<v Speaker 2>two zero conscientiousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might say,</v>

214
00:11:53.831 --> 00:11:54.581
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you square,</v>

215
00:11:54.581 --> 00:11:55.414
<v Speaker 2>they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That gives you four percent of the </v>

216
00:11:56.711 --> 00:11:57.544
<v Speaker 2>variance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who the hell cares for percent of the </v>

217
00:11:59.201 --> 00:12:00.034
<v Speaker 2>variance?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've left 95 percent of the </v>

218
00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:06.460
<v Speaker 2>variability between people in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>their performance unexplained.</v>

219
00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:07.361
<v Speaker 2>You might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

220
00:12:07.361 --> 00:12:08.800
<v Speaker 2>why even bother?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

221
00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:13.830
<v Speaker 2>the answer to that question is how much </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference in productive output is there</v>

222
00:12:14.411 --> 00:12:15.244
<v Speaker 2>between people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if there's a tremendous degree </v>

223
00:12:17.471 --> 00:12:18.304
<v Speaker 2>of productive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of difference in productive output </v>

224
00:12:20.141 --> 00:12:20.974
<v Speaker 2>between people than increasing your </v>
<v Speaker 2>ability to predict someone's </v>

225
00:12:23.711 --> 00:12:24.544
<v Speaker 2>performance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even by some relatively small increment </v>

226
00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:28.173
<v Speaker 2>might have massive economic utility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If let's say the top 10 percent of your </v>

227
00:12:32.381 --> 00:12:33.214
<v Speaker 2>people are 50 times as productive as the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bottom 10 percent of your people than </v>

228
00:12:36.941 --> 00:12:37.774
<v Speaker 2>shifting your ability to predict up so </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you have more of those extremely </v>

229
00:12:40.421 --> 00:12:41.254
<v Speaker 2>high performing people or less of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>extremely low performing people might </v>

230
00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:48.490
<v Speaker 2>more than payoff might more than pay for</v>
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>

231
00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:50.890
<v Speaker 2>From an economic perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though your prediction,</v>

232
00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:52.143
<v Speaker 2>your predictor isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't have that massive amount of </v>

233
00:12:54.191 --> 00:12:56.590
<v Speaker 2>power when that actually happens to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>the case.</v>

234
00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:59.720
<v Speaker 2>So back in 1968,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a guy named Walter Michelle.</v>

235
00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:01.780
<v Speaker 2>He had reviewed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a social psychologist.</v>

236
00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:02.943
<v Speaker 2>He reviewed the personality literature </v>
<v Speaker 2>up to that point and concluded that the </v>

237
00:13:05.891 --> 00:13:06.724
<v Speaker 2>typical personality measure only </v>
<v Speaker 2>predicted the typical performance </v>

238
00:13:10.451 --> 00:13:14.050
<v Speaker 2>measure at about point two and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually remained relatively stable.</v>

239
00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:15.500
<v Speaker 2>I would say it's a little higher than </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

240
00:13:15.501 --> 00:13:18.640
<v Speaker 2>It's probably point two five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if you do things like correct</v>

241
00:13:18.641 --> 00:13:20.050
<v Speaker 2>for measurement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>error and so forth.</v>

242
00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:23.380
<v Speaker 2>And what Michelle said was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's only point two five,</v>

243
00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:26.500
<v Speaker 2>let's say you square that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's five percent of the variants.</v>

244
00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:29.350
<v Speaker 2>You leave 95 percent of the phenomena </v>
<v Speaker 2>unexplained.</v>

245
00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:30.483
<v Speaker 2>You might as well not even bother </v>
<v Speaker 2>measuring personality and so that </v>

246
00:13:33.101 --> 00:13:33.934
<v Speaker 2>actually killed the field of personality</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a psychometric perspective for </v>

247
00:13:36.581 --> 00:13:37.750
<v Speaker 2>about 25 years.</v>

248
00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:41.320
<v Speaker 2>Really until about the early 19 nineties</v>
<v Speaker 2>when people woke up and thought,</v>

249
00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:42.243
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are the typical effect sizes in </v>

250
00:13:45.011 --> 00:13:48.490
<v Speaker 2>other domains of prediction?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they found out that,</v>

251
00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:49.593
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the point two zero correlation that was </v>

252
00:13:51.551 --> 00:13:52.384
<v Speaker 2>typical of personality prediction was </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually pretty damn good by social </v>

253
00:13:55.631 --> 00:13:59.410
<v Speaker 2>sciences or health sciences standards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it doesn't sound good when you just</v>

254
00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:00.303
<v Speaker 2>think about it as an absolute measure </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it leaves 95 percent of the </v>

255
00:14:04.031 --> 00:14:04.864
<v Speaker 2>phenomena unexplained,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you compare it to other things </v>

256
00:14:07.031 --> 00:14:07.864
<v Speaker 2>that people consider of reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 2>magnitude than it turns out that </v>

257
00:14:10.631 --> 00:14:13.090
<v Speaker 2>personality psychologists are doing just</v>
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>

258
00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:16.000
<v Speaker 2>And then also in the 19 nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'll show you some of this,</v>

259
00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:20.140
<v Speaker 2>the economic calculations done and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>so one of the calculations would be well</v>

260
00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:21.423
<v Speaker 2>imagine that you have maybe it took 20 </v>
<v Speaker 2>companies and you did it a distribution </v>

261
00:14:26.261 --> 00:14:28.120
<v Speaker 2>of the productivity of their employees.</v>

262
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:30.520
<v Speaker 2>It's hard thing to do because you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to measure their productivity.</v>

263
00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:32.200
<v Speaker 2>So how the hell do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

264
00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:34.330
<v Speaker 2>With salespeople,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can measure sales.</v>

265
00:14:34.331 --> 00:14:36.460
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty straightforward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>With lawyers,</v>

266
00:14:36.461 --> 00:14:38.620
<v Speaker 2>you can measure hours billed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there are some,</v>

267
00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:39.933
<v Speaker 2>there are some occupations where the </v>
<v Speaker 2>performance measure is sort of built </v>

268
00:14:42.491 --> 00:14:45.640
<v Speaker 2>into the job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you're a manager in the mid level</v>

269
00:14:45.641 --> 00:14:48.340
<v Speaker 2>of a large corporation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the hell can you tell how productive</v>

270
00:14:48.341 --> 00:14:50.800
<v Speaker 2>you are?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so there's a measurement problem on</v>

271
00:14:50.801 --> 00:14:51.634
<v Speaker 2>the productivity measurement and as well</v>
<v Speaker 2>as the performance prediction and and </v>

272
00:14:55.791 --> 00:14:56.624
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very intractable problem and the </v>

273
00:14:58.101 --> 00:14:59.930
<v Speaker 2>way that people often do that is by </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

274
00:14:59.931 --> 00:15:00.764
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say you're a manager in the mid </v>

275
00:15:01.911 --> 00:15:02.744
<v Speaker 2>level of a corporation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do we determine how productive we </v>

276
00:15:04.491 --> 00:15:05.324
<v Speaker 2>are?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are,</v>

277
00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:10.070
<v Speaker 2>while we might ask you to compare your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your work productivity with your peers,</v>

278
00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:11.233
<v Speaker 2>maybe construct up a questionnaire </v>
<v Speaker 2>asking about your efficient use of time </v>

279
00:15:13.821 --> 00:15:14.654
<v Speaker 2>and so forth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then we might get your peers to do </v>

280
00:15:16.431 --> 00:15:17.450
<v Speaker 2>the same thing to you.</v>

281
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:21.400
<v Speaker 2>We might get your supervisors to do the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same thing to you and we might get your,</v>

282
00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:22.513
<v Speaker 2>your subordinates to do the same thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>to you and then aggregate across all </v>

283
00:15:24.981 --> 00:15:29.981
<v Speaker 2>those measures and infer that that </v>
<v Speaker 2>aggregate opinion actually constitutes a</v>

284
00:15:30.591 --> 00:15:33.380
<v Speaker 2>valid measure of productivity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You actually don't know,</v>

285
00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:34.273
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that assumes that what you're </v>

286
00:15:35.721 --> 00:15:37.880
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that your peers and your supervisors and</v>

287
00:15:37.881 --> 00:15:38.714
<v Speaker 2>so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our rating is actually related in some </v>

288
00:15:41.301 --> 00:15:44.450
<v Speaker 2>positive manner to the bottom line of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the company and you actually don't.</v>

289
00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:47.060
<v Speaker 2>You actually can't figure that out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is actually,</v>

290
00:15:47.061 --> 00:15:47.894
<v Speaker 2>I think why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why large companies start to become </v>

291
00:15:48.951 --> 00:15:49.784
<v Speaker 2>unstable is because if there's enough </v>
<v Speaker 2>layers between the operations of the </v>

292
00:15:54.021 --> 00:15:59.021
<v Speaker 2>people in the tiers of the corporation </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the real outcome measure,</v>

293
00:15:59.151 --> 00:16:01.880
<v Speaker 2>which is basically profit because that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we've got.</v>

294
00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.193
<v Speaker 2>Then the relationship between your </v>
<v Speaker 2>activity as a manager and the </v>

295
00:16:07.191 --> 00:16:08.024
<v Speaker 2>productivity of the company starts to </v>
<v Speaker 2>become increasingly blurred and that </v>

296
00:16:10.941 --> 00:16:11.774
<v Speaker 2>might mean that you're working as hard </v>
<v Speaker 2>as you can on something that's actually </v>

297
00:16:14.301 --> 00:16:15.134
<v Speaker 2>going to cost the company money so you </v>
<v Speaker 2>would actually be much more productive </v>

298
00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:19.153
<v Speaker 2>from a profit perspective if you just </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't go to work at all and that that </v>

299
00:16:22.041 --> 00:16:24.920
<v Speaker 2>happens a lot in large corporations </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you'd never know,</v>

300
00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:26.413
<v Speaker 2>especially if there's a lot of steps </v>
<v Speaker 2>that have to be undertaken in a process </v>

301
00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:31.730
<v Speaker 2>before you can test the product in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>market.</v>

302
00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:34.700
<v Speaker 2>You have no idea if you're wasting time </v>
<v Speaker 2>and resources.</v>

303
00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:35.563
<v Speaker 2>You just can't tell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the performance measurement issue is </v>

304
00:16:38.061 --> 00:16:39.470
<v Speaker 2>a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very complicated one.</v>

305
00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:40.483
<v Speaker 2>We haven't talked about it that much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I gave you a kind of a brief </v>

306
00:16:42.651 --> 00:16:43.484
<v Speaker 2>overview of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now what you really want to do is have </v>

307
00:16:44.901 --> 00:16:45.734
<v Speaker 2>multiple sources of information about </v>
<v Speaker 2>performance and aggregate across them </v>

308
00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:53.960
<v Speaker 2>and if you can use real world measures </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are tied to two income generation,</v>

309
00:16:53.961 --> 00:16:57.230
<v Speaker 2>so much the better because you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>use something as your gold standard,</v>

310
00:16:57.231 --> 00:16:58.064
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to say at some point while </v>

311
00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:00.383
<v Speaker 2>we're going to define this as reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to performance and in a </v>

312
00:17:03.561 --> 00:17:04.394
<v Speaker 2>free market economy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>roughly what you do there is you say </v>

313
00:17:06.471 --> 00:17:07.304
<v Speaker 2>that what profit is the proxy for </v>
<v Speaker 2>productivity and that isn't the same </v>

314
00:17:10.251 --> 00:17:11.084
<v Speaker 2>thing saying is that it isn't the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing as saying that profit is </v>

315
00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:15.380
<v Speaker 2>productivity.</v>

316
00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:16.573
<v Speaker 2>That's not the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's saying that at some point you have </v>

317
00:17:18.861 --> 00:17:19.694
<v Speaker 2>to decide what you're going to accept as</v>
<v Speaker 2>a measure of productivity because </v>

318
00:17:22.461 --> 00:17:23.294
<v Speaker 2>otherwise there's no point in even </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about it and you can't just not </v>

319
00:17:26.781 --> 00:17:27.614
<v Speaker 2>talk about productivity if you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>running an organization because the </v>

320
00:17:30.471 --> 00:17:31.304
<v Speaker 2>organization doesn't exist unless it </v>
<v Speaker 2>produces something that will keep it </v>

321
00:17:34.011 --> 00:17:36.380
<v Speaker 2>going and generally that happens to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

322
00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:38.120
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's quite,</v>

323
00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:39.680
<v Speaker 2>it's very complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of this.</v>

324
00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:43.850
<v Speaker 2>I was also curious about because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm curious,</v>

325
00:17:43.851 --> 00:17:44.684
<v Speaker 2>I guess is to find out what would happen</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I took a measure that was derived in </v>

326
00:17:47.961 --> 00:17:50.070
<v Speaker 2>the lab and then try to launch it out in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

327
00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:53.880
<v Speaker 2>in the actual real world environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tried to market and sell it and now that</v>

328
00:17:53.881 --> 00:17:57.430
<v Speaker 2>was very informative because I presume </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we develop tests,</v>

329
00:17:57.431 --> 00:17:58.264
<v Speaker 2>which I'll talk to you about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were actually pretty good at </v>

330
00:17:59.641 --> 00:18:02.370
<v Speaker 2>predicting performance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>managerial performance for example,</v>

331
00:18:02.371 --> 00:18:03.420
<v Speaker 2>administrative performance.</v>

332
00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:07.260
<v Speaker 2>We got ours have upwards of point six </v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really bloody impressive.</v>

333
00:18:07.261 --> 00:18:08.700
<v Speaker 2>So we could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could tell employers,</v>

334
00:18:08.701 --> 00:18:10.350
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you use our tests,</v>

335
00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:11.423
<v Speaker 2>we can increase the probability that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll hire an above average employee </v>

336
00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:14.813
<v Speaker 2>from 50 slash 50 to 80 20 and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>economic benefit of that will be </v>

337
00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:20.460
<v Speaker 2>staggering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Staggering.</v>

338
00:18:20.461 --> 00:18:21.294
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'll show you the calculations that </v>

339
00:18:22.021 --> 00:18:24.540
<v Speaker 2>enabled that sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sort of prediction to be made.</v>

340
00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:27.630
<v Speaker 2>And you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well and this is what you do think.</v>

341
00:18:27.631 --> 00:18:30.090
<v Speaker 2>If you're naive about producing </v>
<v Speaker 2>something of value,</v>

342
00:18:30.091 --> 00:18:30.751
<v Speaker 2>you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

343
00:18:30.751 --> 00:18:33.420
<v Speaker 2>if you can produce something that's of </v>
<v Speaker 2>self evident,</v>

344
00:18:33.421 --> 00:18:37.680
<v Speaker 2>economic value selling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will be a snap and that is so wrong,</v>

345
00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:40.530
<v Speaker 2>you just cannot believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things we found,</v>

346
00:18:40.531 --> 00:18:41.364
<v Speaker 2>which was really mind boggling to me was</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you could make a case that the </v>

347
00:18:46.171 --> 00:18:50.310
<v Speaker 2>probability that a company will use a </v>
<v Speaker 2>test that predicts performance,</v>

348
00:18:50.311 --> 00:18:51.144
<v Speaker 2>the pro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the probability that they will use the </v>

349
00:18:52.771 --> 00:18:56.160
<v Speaker 2>test is inversely related to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>accuracy of the test,</v>

350
00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:57.413
<v Speaker 2>which basically means that the less </v>
<v Speaker 2>accurate tests are easier to sell and </v>

351
00:19:00.181 --> 00:19:00.601
<v Speaker 2>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

352
00:19:00.601 --> 00:19:01.950
<v Speaker 2>why the hell would that be?</v>

353
00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:02.783
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the how in the world would it </v>

354
00:19:04.081 --> 00:19:04.914
<v Speaker 2>possibly be that corporations would </v>
<v Speaker 2>rather buy tests that don't work than </v>

355
00:19:08.011 --> 00:19:08.844
<v Speaker 2>tests that do work and that that is what</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do because really what they do by </v>

356
00:19:11.941 --> 00:19:13.530
<v Speaker 2>is the Meyer's breaks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

357
00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:18.120
<v Speaker 2>That sells about a million units a year </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the Myers Briggs has zero predictive</v>

358
00:19:18.121 --> 00:19:20.400
<v Speaker 2>utility with regards to performance </v>
<v Speaker 2>prediction.</v>

359
00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:22.590
<v Speaker 2>So why do people use it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

360
00:19:22.591 --> 00:19:25.560
<v Speaker 2>here's one reason it doesn't hurt </v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody's feelings.</v>

361
00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:27.330
<v Speaker 2>Everybody wins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

362
00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:28.770
<v Speaker 2>And so then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

363
00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:29.813
<v Speaker 2>do corporations really care whether or </v>
<v Speaker 2>not everybody wins when they're being </v>

364
00:19:33.001 --> 00:19:34.980
<v Speaker 2>tested?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the answer to that is yes,</v>

365
00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:39.900
<v Speaker 2>much more often than you would think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we hit all sorts of barriers.</v>

366
00:19:39.901 --> 00:19:43.230
<v Speaker 2>That was one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem with tests that work is that</v>

367
00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:45.690
<v Speaker 2>most of the people who take them don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>do very well on them.</v>

368
00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:48.210
<v Speaker 2>And then the other problem is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

369
00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:51.150
<v Speaker 2>people aren't good at statistical </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasoning at all.</v>

370
00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:52.440
<v Speaker 2>They're really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really bad at it.</v>

371
00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:54.840
<v Speaker 2>And so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't know the difference between a</v>

372
00:19:54.841 --> 00:19:59.610
<v Speaker 2>percentage and a percentile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a percentage is if you get 40 percent</v>

373
00:19:59.611 --> 00:20:00.444
<v Speaker 2>on a test,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it means you've got 40 percent of the </v>

374
00:20:01.231 --> 00:20:02.064
<v Speaker 2>questions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

375
00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:06.150
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you are at the 40th percentile in the</v>

376
00:20:06.151 --> 00:20:09.420
<v Speaker 2>distribution of test scores,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it means that you perform better than 40</v>

377
00:20:09.421 --> 00:20:12.420
<v Speaker 2>percent of the people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's actually not too bad.</v>

378
00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:14.130
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you'll think,</v>

379
00:20:14.131 --> 00:20:15.690
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not 40 percentile,</v>

380
00:20:15.691 --> 00:20:17.820
<v Speaker 2>that's 40 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you'll think that you failed.</v>

381
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.890
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the things we found for </v>
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>

382
00:20:19.891 --> 00:20:20.724
<v Speaker 2>was that when we were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we were marketing the tests to mid </v>

383
00:20:23.821 --> 00:20:28.260
<v Speaker 2>level managers who had some say at least</v>
<v Speaker 2>on whether or not they would be used,</v>

384
00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:31.380
<v Speaker 2>the first thing they would say as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to do the test.</v>

385
00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:32.813
<v Speaker 2>And the thing you say about that is no </v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't because this is derived </v>

386
00:20:35.911 --> 00:20:39.780
<v Speaker 2>statistically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't validate the test on the basis</v>

387
00:20:39.781 --> 00:20:42.900
<v Speaker 2>of your opinion about its applicability </v>
<v Speaker 2>in your case,</v>

388
00:20:42.901 --> 00:20:43.734
<v Speaker 2>but you can't have that conversation </v>
<v Speaker 2>that isn't going to go anywhere because </v>

389
00:20:46.021 --> 00:20:46.854
<v Speaker 2>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

390
00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:48.040
<v Speaker 2>I'd never give a test to my</v>

391
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:49.930
<v Speaker 3>employees that I hadn't taken myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

392
00:20:49.931 --> 00:20:50.950
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then you think,</v>

393
00:20:50.951 --> 00:20:51.784
<v Speaker 3>well you're a typical manager,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to score at the 50th </v>

394
00:20:54.161 --> 00:20:56.620
<v Speaker 3>percentile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are not going to be happy about that</v>

395
00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:57.663
<v Speaker 3>because you want a score at the 90th </v>
<v Speaker 3>percentile because you confuse </v>

396
00:20:59.981 --> 00:21:00.814
<v Speaker 3>percentiles and percentages.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also because you don't notice that </v>

397
00:21:04.001 --> 00:21:06.190
<v Speaker 3>if you're doing better than 50 percent </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the managers.</v>

398
00:21:06.191 --> 00:21:07.990
<v Speaker 3>That's actually pretty damn good </v>
<v Speaker 3>question.</v>

399
00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:11.033
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

400
00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:21.140
<v Speaker 3>that's a good lead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>

401
00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:22.960
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll answer that as I go through this.</v>

402
00:21:22.961 --> 00:21:23.860
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

403
00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:24.963
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that was often at a dead started </v>

404
00:21:27.281 --> 00:21:28.114
<v Speaker 3>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the other thing we'd find this </v>

405
00:21:29.051 --> 00:21:29.884
<v Speaker 3>was cool to have horrible but cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So imagine a large corporation and you </v>

406
00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:35.013
<v Speaker 3>go in and you try to make a sales pitch </v>
<v Speaker 3>to someone and maybe they're in hr and </v>

407
00:21:38.531 --> 00:21:39.610
<v Speaker 3>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you say to them,</v>

408
00:21:39.611 --> 00:21:40.444
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could use these tests if you use it </v>

409
00:21:41.171 --> 00:21:43.390
<v Speaker 3>for 100.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People will increase your bottom line by</v>

410
00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:46.660
<v Speaker 3>$2,000,000 a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think people would be jumping up and</v>

411
00:21:46.661 --> 00:21:48.340
<v Speaker 3>down about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they say,</v>

412
00:21:48.341 --> 00:21:50.470
<v Speaker 3>well how much does it cost?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we say,</v>

413
00:21:50.471 --> 00:21:54.160
<v Speaker 3>well it doesn't matter because the cost </v>
<v Speaker 3>to benefit ratio is what you should care</v>

414
00:21:54.161 --> 00:21:55.180
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not the cost.</v>

415
00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:57.370
<v Speaker 3>Because they would want it say for $9 a </v>
<v Speaker 3>test.</v>

416
00:21:57.371 --> 00:21:58.204
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

417
00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:02.140
<v Speaker 3>if you do this for each and I'll show </v>
<v Speaker 3>you the mathematics and a bit.</v>

418
00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:03.573
<v Speaker 3>Each person that you select with this </v>
<v Speaker 3>test will bring $20,000 of extra value </v>

419
00:22:07.211 --> 00:22:09.580
<v Speaker 3>to your company.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not getting that for $9.</v>

420
00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:10.990
<v Speaker 3>And then they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well wait a minute.</v>

421
00:22:10.991 --> 00:22:14.920
<v Speaker 3>We have a budget for testing that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>limited to $9 a test and they say,</v>

422
00:22:14.921 --> 00:22:15.754
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to produce $30,000 a year in </v>

423
00:22:17.081 --> 00:22:18.040
<v Speaker 3>revenue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They say,</v>

424
00:22:18.041 --> 00:22:18.874
<v Speaker 3>well that revenue goes to another branch</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the company and we won't get any </v>

425
00:22:20.951 --> 00:22:21.784
<v Speaker 3>credit for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll just get punished because we've </v>

426
00:22:23.141 --> 00:22:25.540
<v Speaker 3>exceeded our budget,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our budget for selection.</v>

427
00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:27.130
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

428
00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:28.043
<v Speaker 3>I never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>never,</v>

429
00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:31.690
<v Speaker 3>never expected that to come up as an </v>
<v Speaker 3>obstacle so you know,</v>

430
00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:32.733
<v Speaker 3>so we had very well designed products.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They also talk about 90 minutes because </v>

431
00:22:36.521 --> 00:22:37.354
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we started with a full scale </v>

432
00:22:38.321 --> 00:22:39.154
<v Speaker 3>neuropsychological assessment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we took tests of dorsolateral </v>

433
00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:43.593
<v Speaker 3>prefrontal cortical ability which had </v>
<v Speaker 3>before that been administered by neuro </v>

434
00:22:47.231 --> 00:22:50.530
<v Speaker 3>psychologists and we computerized and we</v>
<v Speaker 3>did that back in 1993.</v>

435
00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:51.363
<v Speaker 3>So it was among the first attempts to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>this sort of thing and then we had a 90 </v>

436
00:22:53.901 --> 00:22:54.734
<v Speaker 3>minute test battery that also assessed </v>
<v Speaker 3>the big five and then you could give </v>

437
00:22:57.911 --> 00:23:00.120
<v Speaker 3>that to employees and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could,</v>

438
00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:01.063
<v Speaker 3>you could produce this 80 slash 20 </v>
<v Speaker 3>differential that I described and well </v>

439
00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:05.320
<v Speaker 3>then we found out what that test was too</v>
<v Speaker 3>long.</v>

440
00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:06.310
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

441
00:23:06.311 --> 00:23:07.144
<v Speaker 3>what do you mean you're going to gain </v>
<v Speaker 3>$30,000 a year per employee if you use </v>

442
00:23:10.211 --> 00:23:10.931
<v Speaker 3>this test?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

443
00:23:10.931 --> 00:23:12.730
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people don't want to be tested that log.</v>

444
00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:13.780
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

445
00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:17.530
<v Speaker 3>so you want an accurate test that </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't discriminate against anybody.</v>

446
00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:18.483
<v Speaker 3>That makes everyone feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's dirt cheap and that doesn't take </v>

447
00:23:20.411 --> 00:23:21.910
<v Speaker 3>any time at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

448
00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:22.983
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it took us about 15 years to build one </v>

449
00:23:24.311 --> 00:23:25.144
<v Speaker 3>of those after we had built the original</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing that actually worked and so even </v>

450
00:23:28.031 --> 00:23:28.864
<v Speaker 3>then the the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the process of trying to introduce it </v>

451
00:23:30.791 --> 00:23:32.920
<v Speaker 3>into the workplace was almost </v>
<v Speaker 3>impossible.</v>

452
00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:36.310
<v Speaker 3>The other thing you find if you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to sell the large companies,</v>

453
00:23:36.311 --> 00:23:37.144
<v Speaker 3>this is this is worth knowing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that it's great if you can sell to a </v>

454
00:23:39.281 --> 00:23:42.510
<v Speaker 3>large company because it's a large </v>
<v Speaker 3>company man and so you.</v>

455
00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:45.830
<v Speaker 3>The potential for the sale is </v>
<v Speaker 3>astronomical,</v>

456
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:50.240
<v Speaker 3>but large companies are so slow you </v>
<v Speaker 3>cannot believe it,</v>

457
00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:53.150
<v Speaker 3>and so it might take you three years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

458
00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:54.133
<v Speaker 3>you have to find who you should talk to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's impossible because they all the </v>

459
00:23:56.901 --> 00:23:59.870
<v Speaker 3>people that you can talk to have no </v>
<v Speaker 3>decision making power whatsoever,</v>

460
00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:03.410
<v Speaker 3>so all you do is waste your time talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>to them and they'll talk to you.</v>

461
00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:04.363
<v Speaker 3>They'll have meetings with you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it won't matter because they don't </v>

462
00:24:05.601 --> 00:24:06.434
<v Speaker 3>have any decision making power and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't get access to people who have </v>

463
00:24:09.321 --> 00:24:12.020
<v Speaker 3>the decision making power because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't let you have access to them.</v>

464
00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:16.550
<v Speaker 3>And so that's a huge problem and even </v>
<v Speaker 3>figuring them out is a huge problem.</v>

465
00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:17.563
<v Speaker 3>And even figuring out that those are the</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that you need to talk to is a </v>

466
00:24:19.641 --> 00:24:20.474
<v Speaker 3>huge problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that might take you five years just </v>

467
00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:25.310
<v Speaker 3>to get it through your head that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're wasting your time.</v>

468
00:24:25.311 --> 00:24:28.340
<v Speaker 3>Ninety five percent of the time talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the wrong people.</v>

469
00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:30.950
<v Speaker 3>And so then the next thing that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is really,</v>

470
00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:34.010
<v Speaker 3>this is really comical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's say you do make some headway.</v>

471
00:24:34.011 --> 00:24:35.620
<v Speaker 3>It takes you three bloody years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've,</v>

472
00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:37.310
<v Speaker 3>you've made a relationship with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>

473
00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:38.323
<v Speaker 3>they're ready to launch it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then they have to market it internally </v>

474
00:24:40.161 --> 00:24:40.994
<v Speaker 3>and that takes them a year because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to convince everybody to get </v>

475
00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:43.733
<v Speaker 3>onboard and then the corporation </v>
<v Speaker 3>reshuffles and the person that you're </v>

476
00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:49.400
<v Speaker 3>dealing with disappears.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like that happened to us.</v>

477
00:24:49.401 --> 00:24:51.350
<v Speaker 3>We were marketing to a very large </v>
<v Speaker 3>company.</v>

478
00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:52.483
<v Speaker 3>We would go all the way up to the CEO </v>
<v Speaker 3>and ready to with this was with the </v>

479
00:24:56.301 --> 00:25:00.560
<v Speaker 3>future authoring program and we were </v>
<v Speaker 3>ready to launch the damn product.</v>

480
00:25:00.561 --> 00:25:04.880
<v Speaker 3>It took us a huge amount of time to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>through all the layers and just the week</v>

481
00:25:04.881 --> 00:25:05.714
<v Speaker 3>that we were going to launch it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the CEO resigned and the company stock </v>

482
00:25:08.031 --> 00:25:08.864
<v Speaker 3>crashed and that was the end of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bang and and large companies are like </v>

483
00:25:12.801 --> 00:25:13.634
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they're extremely slow and the </v>

484
00:25:15.651 --> 00:25:20.300
<v Speaker 3>typical duration that a person lasts in </v>
<v Speaker 3>a given position,</v>

485
00:25:20.301 --> 00:25:21.134
<v Speaker 3>and this is something to consider with </v>
<v Speaker 3>regards to your careers is both for </v>

486
00:25:23.601 --> 00:25:24.434
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you'll occupy the position you're in </v>

487
00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:30.500
<v Speaker 3>for about four years and then while </v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll either fail out,</v>

488
00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:31.513
<v Speaker 3>you'll move laterally or you'll move up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it's a three year sales cycle </v>

489
00:25:35.151 --> 00:25:35.984
<v Speaker 3>minimum,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's interweaved with the </v>

490
00:25:38.121 --> 00:25:40.940
<v Speaker 3>possibility that whoever you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>to is just going to disappear.</v>

491
00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:41.973
<v Speaker 3>It's so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then if you small cell to small </v>

492
00:25:43.011 --> 00:25:44.870
<v Speaker 3>companies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well they're faster,</v>

493
00:25:44.871 --> 00:25:48.440
<v Speaker 3>but they don't have any money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's not very helpful.</v>

494
00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:49.453
<v Speaker 3>So it's extraordinarily difficult even </v>
<v Speaker 3>if you produce something of high value </v>

495
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.160
<v Speaker 3>and that you have proof that the thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>exists,</v>

496
00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:57.260
<v Speaker 3>it's extraordinarily difficult to sell </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

497
00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:59.480
<v Speaker 3>And so here's another thing to think </v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

498
00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:01.043
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I've mentioned this to you </v>

499
00:26:02.031 --> 00:26:02.864
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you write a book which is virtually </v>

500
00:26:03.801 --> 00:26:05.690
<v Speaker 3>impossible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then get a publisher,</v>

501
00:26:05.691 --> 00:26:08.780
<v Speaker 3>which is virtually impossible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you probably have a rejection rate of 99</v>

502
00:26:08.781 --> 00:26:11.930
<v Speaker 3>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then if you do,</v>

503
00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:16.280
<v Speaker 3>if you do manage to publish the book </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a reasonable publisher,</v>

504
00:26:16.281 --> 00:26:19.670
<v Speaker 3>which you won't because it's impossible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you get eight percent royalties.</v>

505
00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:20.533
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So 92 percent of your labor goes to the </v>

506
00:26:23.421 --> 00:26:24.254
<v Speaker 3>sales,</v>
<v Speaker 3>marketing and distribution end of </v>

507
00:26:25.161 --> 00:26:27.110
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it's just.</v>

508
00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:31.940
<v Speaker 3>So it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very difficult to generate capital as an</v>

509
00:26:31.941 --> 00:26:32.750
<v Speaker 3>entrepreneur.</v>

510
00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:37.250
<v Speaker 3>And there's innumerable impediments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that people do,</v>

511
00:26:37.251 --> 00:26:40.880
<v Speaker 3>and this is something for those of you </v>
<v Speaker 3>who might be entrepreneurially minded,</v>

512
00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:41.863
<v Speaker 3>here's another thing that you have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand is that you can't really </v>

513
00:26:44.131 --> 00:26:46.980
<v Speaker 3>create a product and then launch it </v>
<v Speaker 3>because first of all,</v>

514
00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:48.143
<v Speaker 3>you don't know how to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might know how to create the </v>

515
00:26:49.951 --> 00:26:50.784
<v Speaker 3>product,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you do not know how to market or </v>

516
00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:53.700
<v Speaker 3>sell it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't know how to advertise it.</v>

517
00:26:53.701 --> 00:26:54.990
<v Speaker 3>You don't know how to communicate about </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

518
00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:56.033
<v Speaker 3>You don't know how to ship it like </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's all sorts of things you just </v>

519
00:26:58.441 --> 00:26:59.274
<v Speaker 3>don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but worse is you don't know if people </v>

520
00:27:00.751 --> 00:27:03.480
<v Speaker 3>will use it and so what companies do </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

521
00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:04.343
<v Speaker 3>jen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that roll out new products on a </v>

522
00:27:05.881 --> 00:27:06.714
<v Speaker 3>relatively continual basis do is they </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't develop the product and then go </v>

523
00:27:09.781 --> 00:27:10.614
<v Speaker 3>sell it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They continually communicate with their </v>

524
00:27:12.271 --> 00:27:16.320
<v Speaker 3>customers about what product the </v>
<v Speaker 3>customer is willing to buy next and then</v>

525
00:27:16.321 --> 00:27:21.321
<v Speaker 3>they develop that and so you have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have your market identified and then you</v>

526
00:27:21.631 --> 00:27:24.090
<v Speaker 3>have to be in continual communication </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the market.</v>

527
00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:25.740
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you develop the product.</v>

528
00:27:25.741 --> 00:27:26.574
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I built a better mouse trap and the </v>

529
00:27:27.601 --> 00:27:28.434
<v Speaker 3>world comes marching to my door.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That isn't how it works is that you got </v>

530
00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:32.653
<v Speaker 3>to find out if someone wants to buy your</v>
<v Speaker 3>stupid thing and then the next thing is </v>

531
00:27:35.911 --> 00:27:36.744
<v Speaker 3>is that even if you have a great thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to go talk to people and </v>

532
00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:43.260
<v Speaker 3>they have 50 great things that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>might buy and they're all great,</v>

533
00:27:43.261 --> 00:27:44.094
<v Speaker 3>but they're not going to buy all 50.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They might buy one maybe and maybe </v>

534
00:27:46.681 --> 00:27:47.514
<v Speaker 3>they'll buy it this week,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but probably they'll buy it in six </v>

535
00:27:48.751 --> 00:27:51.840
<v Speaker 3>months and they're not going to buy any </v>
<v Speaker 3>of them no matter how great.</v>

536
00:27:51.841 --> 00:27:52.674
<v Speaker 3>Unless they're on fire and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>selling water because they're so busy </v>

537
00:27:56.671 --> 00:27:58.290
<v Speaker 3>already,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

538
00:27:58.291 --> 00:27:59.124
<v Speaker 3>They're so overwhelmed and preoccupied </v>
<v Speaker 3>by their jobs that if you come in and </v>

539
00:28:02.161 --> 00:28:02.701
<v Speaker 3>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

540
00:28:02.701 --> 00:28:03.534
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is going to increase your </v>

541
00:28:04.081 --> 00:28:06.990
<v Speaker 3>efficiency by 20 percent and here's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>three weeks.</v>

542
00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:07.823
<v Speaker 3>You'd have to spend doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then the payoff would come in the </v>

543
00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:10.891
<v Speaker 3>next years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll say,</v>

544
00:28:10.891 --> 00:28:11.724
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll all do that as soon as I have </v>

545
00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:14.970
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and as soon as I have,</v>

546
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:15.833
<v Speaker 3>time is never.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if they're on fire and you have </v>

547
00:28:18.121 --> 00:28:19.290
<v Speaker 3>water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can sell it to them,</v>

548
00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.990
<v Speaker 3>but that's all because otherwise it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>no goal.</v>

549
00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:22.943
<v Speaker 3>So those are all things that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are worthwhile knowing because </v>

550
00:28:25.951 --> 00:28:29.520
<v Speaker 3>they're very hard to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so and very comically,</v>

551
00:28:29.521 --> 00:28:30.354
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you would've told me when I first </v>

552
00:28:31.471 --> 00:28:35.850
<v Speaker 3>started developing these tests that one </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the reasons corporations wouldn't buy</v>

553
00:28:35.851 --> 00:28:39.090
<v Speaker 3>them because they worked that I would </v>
<v Speaker 3>have just thought really.</v>

554
00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:39.841
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on.</v>

555
00:28:39.841 --> 00:28:41.310
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's really the reason.</v>

556
00:28:41.311 --> 00:28:42.280
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

557
00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:44.670
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the reason God.</v>

558
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.770
<v Speaker 3>So very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

559
00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:47.633
<v Speaker 3>very problematic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they already have their </v>

560
00:28:50.671 --> 00:28:52.980
<v Speaker 3>processes in place and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>entrenched.</v>

561
00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:55.150
<v Speaker 3>And then then the next problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

562
00:28:55.290 --> 00:28:56.520
<v Speaker 3>you haven't got any customers.</v>

563
00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:57.353
<v Speaker 3>I think I told you that before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have any customers and you </v>

564
00:28:59.551 --> 00:29:00.384
<v Speaker 3>show them the statistics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they can understand this statistics </v>

565
00:29:02.521 --> 00:29:03.354
<v Speaker 3>and they also have 200 other people </v>
<v Speaker 3>selling them things and 50 of them are </v>

566
00:29:06.181 --> 00:29:07.890
<v Speaker 3>crooks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they're just lying about what they're</v>

567
00:29:07.891 --> 00:29:08.724
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can't tell the difference between </v>

568
00:29:09.871 --> 00:29:11.760
<v Speaker 3>the liars and the people who were </v>
<v Speaker 3>telling the truth.</v>

569
00:29:11.761 --> 00:29:15.180
<v Speaker 3>And so they can't and they can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand the statistics for themselves</v>

570
00:29:15.181 --> 00:29:16.014
<v Speaker 3>and they can't verify them anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what they ask you is who else is </v>

571
00:29:18.841 --> 00:29:20.520
<v Speaker 3>using it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if the answer is,</v>

572
00:29:20.521 --> 00:29:21.354
<v Speaker 3>well everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you don't even have to do the sale </v>

573
00:29:22.951 --> 00:29:25.980
<v Speaker 3>because you're already rich.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if the answer is nobody,</v>

574
00:29:25.981 --> 00:29:27.180
<v Speaker 3>then they are going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

575
00:29:27.181 --> 00:29:28.740
<v Speaker 3>why is nobody using this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You say,</v>

576
00:29:28.741 --> 00:29:30.480
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the hottest thing that's come along</v>

577
00:29:30.481 --> 00:29:31.380
<v Speaker 3>and they think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

578
00:29:31.381 --> 00:29:32.214
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to be the sucker who gets </v>
<v Speaker 3>painted red dead fired because this </v>

579
00:29:36.121 --> 00:29:39.420
<v Speaker 3>failed that they do not think this might</v>
<v Speaker 3>make me succeed.</v>

580
00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:43.000
<v Speaker 3>People do not about whether or not they </v>
<v Speaker 3>succeed.</v>

581
00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:45.790
<v Speaker 3>They care about whether or not they </v>
<v Speaker 3>fail.</v>

582
00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:46.983
<v Speaker 3>And so that's another thing is that if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're marketing something and you can </v>

583
00:29:49.511 --> 00:29:51.940
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this will stop you from being identified</v>

584
00:29:51.941 --> 00:29:54.700
<v Speaker 3>as a failure than people might be happy </v>
<v Speaker 3>about that.</v>

585
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.310
<v Speaker 3>But if you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this will really help you succeed.</v>

586
00:29:57.311 --> 00:29:57.811
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

587
00:29:57.811 --> 00:29:58.331
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

588
00:29:58.331 --> 00:30:00.910
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to succeed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't want to fail.</v>

589
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:01.833
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to succeed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just want to be invisible and be left </v>

590
00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:06.003
<v Speaker 3>alone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you're looking for people's </v>

591
00:30:07.871 --> 00:30:10.630
<v Speaker 3>fundamental motivation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>

592
00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:15.010
<v Speaker 3>It's they want to be invisible and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to be left alone.</v>

593
00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:18.910
<v Speaker 3>I tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Zebra story [inaudible] you,</v>

594
00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:20.770
<v Speaker 3>any of you know that story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

595
00:30:20.771 --> 00:30:21.581
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you,</v>

596
00:30:21.581 --> 00:30:22.800
<v Speaker 3>this is ebro story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tell it,</v>

597
00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:23.673
<v Speaker 3>stop me if I've told it to you before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This tells you everything you need to </v>

598
00:30:25.841 --> 00:30:26.860
<v Speaker 3>know about human beings.</v>

599
00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:28.090
<v Speaker 3>So it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's worth.</v>

600
00:30:28.091 --> 00:30:29.290
<v Speaker 3>It's worth knowing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

601
00:30:29.291 --> 00:30:32.260
<v Speaker 3>So zebras have stripes and people say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

602
00:30:32.261 --> 00:30:33.094
<v Speaker 3>that's for camouflage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you think about that for two </v>

603
00:30:35.291 --> 00:30:36.124
<v Speaker 3>seconds and you think that's a really </v>
<v Speaker 3>stupid theory because lions are </v>

604
00:30:38.711 --> 00:30:39.544
<v Speaker 3>camouflaged and they're like golden,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the grass and zebras are black and </v>

605
00:30:42.881 --> 00:30:45.490
<v Speaker 3>white.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can see a zebra five miles away.</v>

606
00:30:45.491 --> 00:30:47.140
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's a zebra,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's black and white.</v>

607
00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:48.213
<v Speaker 3>So the whole camouflage thing that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>just not working out so well as a </v>

608
00:30:50.861 --> 00:30:52.270
<v Speaker 3>hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

609
00:30:52.271 --> 00:30:53.104
<v Speaker 3>So bylaw biologists go and they decided </v>
<v Speaker 3>to take a look at some zebras and so </v>

610
00:30:56.711 --> 00:31:00.700
<v Speaker 3>they're looking at zebra at on the herd </v>
<v Speaker 3>because there's no zebra,</v>

611
00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:03.280
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like there's no fish.</v>

612
00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:06.070
<v Speaker 3>There are schools of fish and there are </v>
<v Speaker 3>herds of zebras.</v>

613
00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:07.083
<v Speaker 3>There isn't a fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is why I think the cod aren't </v>

614
00:31:08.981 --> 00:31:11.440
<v Speaker 3>coming back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are no cod.</v>

615
00:31:12.010 --> 00:31:16.090
<v Speaker 3>There are massive hundred mile long </v>
<v Speaker 3>schools have cod,</v>

616
00:31:16.330 --> 00:31:19.720
<v Speaker 3>10 stories deep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20 million years old.</v>

617
00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:20.733
<v Speaker 3>You wipe out the school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't just get to throw a quad in </v>

618
00:31:22.751 --> 00:31:23.710
<v Speaker 3>the water and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

619
00:31:23.711 --> 00:31:24.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>off you go.</v>

620
00:31:24.791 --> 00:31:25.630
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

621
00:31:25.690 --> 00:31:28.240
<v Speaker 3>where's my city?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like launching you in the middle of</v>

622
00:31:28.241 --> 00:31:29.260
<v Speaker 3>a field.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

623
00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:31.240
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go out there and reproduce.</v>

624
00:31:31.241 --> 00:31:31.871
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

625
00:31:31.871 --> 00:31:33.160
<v Speaker 3>that's not gonna happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

626
00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:37.360
<v Speaker 3>so without the school that there's no </v>
<v Speaker 3>cod and you can't just introduce a whole</v>

627
00:31:37.361 --> 00:31:40.000
<v Speaker 3>school of cod because you don't have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole school of cod.</v>

628
00:31:40.001 --> 00:31:40.834
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe the cod are never coming back and </v>

629
00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:44.710
<v Speaker 3>zebras are the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's not a zebra,</v>

630
00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:45.573
<v Speaker 3>there's zebras and so you're looking at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the zebras trying to study as zebra and </v>

631
00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:52.570
<v Speaker 3>you look at the Zebra and you make some </v>
<v Speaker 3>notes and you look up and you think,</v>

632
00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:53.320
<v Speaker 3>oh Christ.</v>

633
00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:56.710
<v Speaker 3>Which zebra was I looking at?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the answer to that is you don't know</v>

634
00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:57.753
<v Speaker 3>because the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the camouflage is against the herd and </v>

635
00:32:00.491 --> 00:32:02.590
<v Speaker 3>the black and white stripes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a variety of reasons for this.</v>

636
00:32:02.591 --> 00:32:05.740
<v Speaker 3>Stripes flies also seem not to like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>stripes,</v>

637
00:32:05.741 --> 00:32:07.150
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>usually people,</v>

638
00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:09.790
<v Speaker 3>things evolve for multiple reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But anyways,</v>

639
00:32:09.791 --> 00:32:12.280
<v Speaker 3>it's very difficult to parse out a zebra</v>
<v Speaker 3>against the herd.</v>

640
00:32:12.281 --> 00:32:13.210
<v Speaker 3>You look down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you look up,</v>

641
00:32:13.211 --> 00:32:14.050
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

642
00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:16.150
<v Speaker 3>I'll hold those damn zebras look the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same.</v>

643
00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:18.130
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the camouflage is effective,</v>

644
00:32:18.131 --> 00:32:20.500
<v Speaker 3>but it's against the herd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right?</v>

645
00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:21.363
<v Speaker 3>So then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well we better identify a zebra so we </v>

646
00:32:23.111 --> 00:32:23.944
<v Speaker 3>can see what he's up to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then you take your jeep and a can of </v>

647
00:32:27.221 --> 00:32:29.170
<v Speaker 3>red paint and a stick with a rag on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>end of it.</v>

648
00:32:29.171 --> 00:32:31.960
<v Speaker 3>And you drive up to the zebras and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>paint their haunch.</v>

649
00:32:31.961 --> 00:32:32.794
<v Speaker 3>Read that a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put a nice red dot on their haunch or </v>

650
00:32:34.271 --> 00:32:36.070
<v Speaker 3>maybe clipped the rear with a clip.</v>

651
00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:38.350
<v Speaker 3>And then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you stand back and you think,</v>

652
00:32:38.351 --> 00:32:39.184
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty,</v>

653
00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:40.093
<v Speaker 3>now I'm going to watch that zebra.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what do you think happens to the </v>

654
00:32:41.631 --> 00:32:44.570
<v Speaker 3>Zebra?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The lions kill it.</v>

655
00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:47.360
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

656
00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:49.280
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because lions,</v>

657
00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:50.540
<v Speaker 3>they're smart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

658
00:32:50.541 --> 00:32:55.490
<v Speaker 3>Hunter hunting animals are smart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they have to identify a zebra before</v>

659
00:32:55.491 --> 00:32:58.580
<v Speaker 3>they can organize their hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can't just hunt the whole herd.</v>

660
00:32:58.820 --> 00:32:59.653
<v Speaker 3>They have to pick out a zebra and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's like a zebra that's got a </v>

661
00:33:02.931 --> 00:33:04.550
<v Speaker 3>sore hip or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you think,</v>

662
00:33:04.551 --> 00:33:05.600
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nature's kind.</v>

663
00:33:05.601 --> 00:33:09.320
<v Speaker 3>It just takes the week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's though no zebra or lions,</v>

664
00:33:09.321 --> 00:33:10.154
<v Speaker 3>like really healthy delicious zebras,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they look like all the other </v>

665
00:33:12.681 --> 00:33:13.514
<v Speaker 3>healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>delicious zebras so they can't get a </v>

666
00:33:14.841 --> 00:33:15.674
<v Speaker 3>beat on them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if there are small and just born or </v>

667
00:33:17.721 --> 00:33:20.570
<v Speaker 3>if they're limping or there's something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that identifies them,</v>

668
00:33:20.571 --> 00:33:24.140
<v Speaker 3>then the lions can pick them out and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then they do pick them out.</v>

669
00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:25.573
<v Speaker 3>And so the rule for human beings is keep</v>
<v Speaker 3>your damn stripes on so the lions don't </v>

670
00:33:29.781 --> 00:33:31.730
<v Speaker 3>get you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm telling you,</v>

671
00:33:31.731 --> 00:33:32.564
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you want to remember one thing from </v>

672
00:33:34.071 --> 00:33:37.340
<v Speaker 3>my class about human motivation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a good thing to learn.</v>

673
00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:38.473
<v Speaker 3>People camouflage themselves against the</v>
<v Speaker 3>herd and they like to be in the middle </v>

674
00:33:42.291 --> 00:33:43.910
<v Speaker 3>of the herd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what fish do.</v>

675
00:33:43.911 --> 00:33:45.620
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have a big school of fish,</v>

676
00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:47.060
<v Speaker 3>the smart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>healthy,</v>

677
00:33:47.061 --> 00:33:47.894
<v Speaker 3>large fish are in the middle of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>school because you know what you call a </v>

678
00:33:50.481 --> 00:33:54.470
<v Speaker 3>fish on the outside of the school bait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

679
00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:55.963
<v Speaker 3>So that's what people are doing there </v>
<v Speaker 3>are trying to move into the middle of </v>

680
00:33:58.671 --> 00:33:59.504
<v Speaker 3>the herd all the time and the herd moves</v>
<v Speaker 3>around or the school moves around and </v>

681
00:34:02.121 --> 00:34:02.751
<v Speaker 3>people are going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

682
00:34:02.751 --> 00:34:04.460
<v Speaker 3>I'm in the middle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm staying in the middle here,</v>

683
00:34:04.461 --> 00:34:05.294
<v Speaker 3>so I've got this protective ring of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people around me so the predators don't </v>

684
00:34:09.321 --> 00:34:10.940
<v Speaker 3>pick me out and do me in.</v>

685
00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:15.020
<v Speaker 3>So okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's part of the reason why I said,</v>

686
00:34:15.021 --> 00:34:15.854
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't sell something to someone for </v>

687
00:34:17.121 --> 00:34:19.550
<v Speaker 3>success because you're thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

688
00:34:19.551 --> 00:34:21.260
<v Speaker 3>people are aiming at success.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't,</v>

689
00:34:21.261 --> 00:34:22.094
<v Speaker 3>don't be thinking that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not by any means necessarily true </v>

690
00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:28.640
<v Speaker 3>trait.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Neuroticism is a potential most powerful</v>

691
00:34:28.641 --> 00:34:29.474
<v Speaker 3>motivator and trait.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Neuroticism is let's not be too </v>

692
00:34:31.821 --> 00:34:33.380
<v Speaker 3>threatened or hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

693
00:34:33.381 --> 00:34:34.214
<v Speaker 3>That's the negative emotion system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the negative emotion system is a </v>

694
00:34:36.831 --> 00:34:38.860
<v Speaker 3>killer source of motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

695
00:34:38.890 --> 00:34:42.980
<v Speaker 3>you also see that there are scales of </v>
<v Speaker 3>wellbeing that have been designed mostly</v>

696
00:34:42.981 --> 00:34:45.830
<v Speaker 3>by social psychologists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which means they're very bad scales most</v>

697
00:34:45.831 --> 00:34:49.790
<v Speaker 3>of the time because their psychometric </v>
<v Speaker 3>capacity is absurdly low,</v>

698
00:34:49.791 --> 00:34:50.624
<v Speaker 3>generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what you find with scales of </v>

699
00:34:52.731 --> 00:34:53.564
<v Speaker 3>wellbeing sometimes they're talked about</v>
<v Speaker 3>as scales of happiness even is that </v>

700
00:34:56.930 --> 00:34:58.730
<v Speaker 3>people aren't after happiness </v>
<v Speaker 3>thereafter,</v>

701
00:34:58.731 --> 00:34:59.564
<v Speaker 3>not hurting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not so they don't want to be </v>

702
00:35:01.941 --> 00:35:02.774
<v Speaker 3>extroverted and enthusiastic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right and and bubbly and full of smiles </v>

703
00:35:06.501 --> 00:35:07.220
<v Speaker 3>and laughter.</v>

704
00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:09.410
<v Speaker 3>That isn't what they mean by I want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be happy.</v>

705
00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:12.170
<v Speaker 3>What they mean is I don't want to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>anxious or in pain,</v>

706
00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:15.590
<v Speaker 3>and so wellbeing scales tend to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like</v>

707
00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:19.760
<v Speaker 3>neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>

708
00:35:19.850 --> 00:35:20.683
<v Speaker 3>emotional stability plus extroversion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the big loading is on emotional </v>

709
00:35:24.231 --> 00:35:25.670
<v Speaker 3>stability.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reverse of neuroticism.</v>

710
00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:27.980
<v Speaker 3>You want to avoid suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to be happy.</v>

711
00:35:28.110 --> 00:35:31.820
<v Speaker 3>You want to avoid suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and one way to avoid suffering is not to</v>

712
00:35:31.821 --> 00:35:32.654
<v Speaker 3>let the Lions Gnaw on you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and one way of doing that is to stay in </v>

713
00:35:35.241 --> 00:35:37.910
<v Speaker 3>the middle of the damn hurt and so and </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

714
00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:40.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm not being a smart Alec about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand why people do that.</v>

715
00:35:41.130 --> 00:35:44.610
<v Speaker 3>There's real danger to being visible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's real danger in being visible.</v>

716
00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:45.653
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might be successful if you're </v>

717
00:35:46.321 --> 00:35:48.060
<v Speaker 3>visible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you also might be dead.</v>

718
00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:49.283
<v Speaker 3>So okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so now there's a number of things to </v>

719
00:35:53.131 --> 00:35:53.964
<v Speaker 3>consider if you're thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>performance prediction and one of them </v>

720
00:35:55.681 --> 00:35:56.514
<v Speaker 3>is to what degree do people vary in </v>
<v Speaker 3>terms of their performance capacity and </v>

721
00:36:00.601 --> 00:36:01.261
<v Speaker 3>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

722
00:36:01.261 --> 00:36:03.180
<v Speaker 3>there's very little performance </v>
<v Speaker 3>variability,</v>

723
00:36:03.330 --> 00:36:06.570
<v Speaker 3>or you might say there's a tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 3>amount of performance variability,</v>

724
00:36:06.571 --> 00:36:10.050
<v Speaker 3>or you might say there's an absurd </v>
<v Speaker 3>amount of performance variability and it</v>

725
00:36:10.051 --> 00:36:14.640
<v Speaker 3>turns out that the claim that there's an</v>
<v Speaker 3>absurd amount of performance variability</v>

726
00:36:14.641 --> 00:36:15.720
<v Speaker 3>is the proper claim.</v>

727
00:36:15.930 --> 00:36:18.780
<v Speaker 3>Iq is normally distributed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so is conscientiousness,</v>

728
00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:19.823
<v Speaker 3>but productivity is distributed along </v>
<v Speaker 3>the prieto distribution and I'll show </v>

729
00:36:23.581 --> 00:36:24.414
<v Speaker 3>you why and that follows a law called </v>
<v Speaker 3>price's law from someone named Derek to </v>

730
00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:31.560
<v Speaker 3>solar price who was studying scientific </v>
<v Speaker 3>productivity in the early 19 sixties.</v>

731
00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:32.753
<v Speaker 3>And what he showed was that a </v>
<v Speaker 3>vanishingly small proportion of the </v>

732
00:36:35.461 --> 00:36:36.294
<v Speaker 3>scientists operating in a given </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientific domain produced half the </v>

733
00:36:39.541 --> 00:36:42.330
<v Speaker 3>output.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so what you see and what's happening</v>

734
00:36:42.331 --> 00:36:45.660
<v Speaker 3>is that to do really well at a given </v>
<v Speaker 3>productive task,</v>

735
00:36:45.661 --> 00:36:48.700
<v Speaker 3>which would also include generating </v>
<v Speaker 3>money as as a proxy for,</v>

736
00:36:48.730 --> 00:36:50.280
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for creative productivity,</v>

737
00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:53.040
<v Speaker 3>is that you have to be a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

738
00:36:53.041 --> 00:36:55.860
<v Speaker 3>have to go your way simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So maybe you have to be really,</v>

739
00:36:55.861 --> 00:36:57.090
<v Speaker 3>really smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to be really,</v>

740
00:36:57.091 --> 00:36:58.620
<v Speaker 3>really lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to be really healthy,</v>

741
00:36:58.621 --> 00:37:01.620
<v Speaker 3>you have to be really energetic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to be really conscientious,</v>

742
00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:03.660
<v Speaker 3>you have to be in the right time at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>right place,</v>

743
00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:06.930
<v Speaker 3>and maybe you also have to have the </v>
<v Speaker 3>right social network,</v>

744
00:37:06.931 --> 00:37:07.380
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

745
00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:11.640
<v Speaker 3>So it's a lot of things and each of </v>
<v Speaker 3>those are small probability there.</v>

746
00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:12.503
<v Speaker 3>Each of those are small probabilities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then if you multiply the small </v>

747
00:37:15.241 --> 00:37:16.074
<v Speaker 3>probabilities together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get an extraordinarily tiny </v>

748
00:37:18.031 --> 00:37:18.864
<v Speaker 3>probability and you have to have all </v>
<v Speaker 3>those things functioning before you're </v>

749
00:37:21.031 --> 00:37:23.200
<v Speaker 3>going to end out on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the,</v>

750
00:37:23.450 --> 00:37:25.920
<v Speaker 3>on the extreme end of the productivity </v>
<v Speaker 3>distribution.</v>

751
00:37:26.130 --> 00:37:26.963
<v Speaker 3>But if you do end up there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you produce almost all of </v>

752
00:37:29.731 --> 00:37:30.564
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's a tiny number of people that </v>

753
00:37:32.761 --> 00:37:33.594
<v Speaker 3>produce almost all of everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's price's law and technically it </v>

754
00:37:36.631 --> 00:37:38.160
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I mentioned this to you before,</v>

755
00:37:38.161 --> 00:37:38.994
<v Speaker 3>it's the square root law.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The square root of the number of people </v>

756
00:37:40.801 --> 00:37:42.660
<v Speaker 3>in a productive domain produce half the </v>
<v Speaker 3>output,</v>

757
00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:44.790
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you have 10 employees,</v>

758
00:37:44.791 --> 00:37:46.920
<v Speaker 3>three of them produce half the output.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you have 100,</v>

759
00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:49.800
<v Speaker 3>10 of them produce half the output.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you have 10,000,</v>

760
00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:52.440
<v Speaker 3>100 of them produce half the productive </v>
<v Speaker 3>output,</v>

761
00:37:52.650 --> 00:37:53.483
<v Speaker 3>and so what that also means is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>because there's massive variability in </v>

762
00:37:56.521 --> 00:37:57.354
<v Speaker 3>performance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to shift your ability to </v>

763
00:37:59.370 --> 00:38:02.910
<v Speaker 3>predict performance very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

764
00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:03.923
<v Speaker 3>very much up towards being better at it </v>
<v Speaker 3>to gain substantially on the positive </v>

765
00:38:08.161 --> 00:38:08.994
<v Speaker 3>side because there's so much difference </v>
<v Speaker 3>in productivity and that actually </v>

766
00:38:12.241 --> 00:38:15.510
<v Speaker 3>happens to be also a function of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>complexity of the job.</v>

767
00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:18.000
<v Speaker 3>If the job is simple,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is means you can.</v>

768
00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:21.750
<v Speaker 3>This job has 10 rules,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe that's a janitorial job.</v>

769
00:38:21.751 --> 00:38:24.420
<v Speaker 3>Let's say you do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it takes a little while to learn it,</v>

770
00:38:24.690 --> 00:38:25.523
<v Speaker 3>but once you've learned it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you basically do the same thing all the </v>

771
00:38:27.061 --> 00:38:27.894
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's not a lot of performance </v>

772
00:38:29.251 --> 00:38:30.084
<v Speaker 3>variability in those jobs and most of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be not by conscientiousness </v>

773
00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:34.823
<v Speaker 3>and also to some by neuroticism because </v>
<v Speaker 3>the higher people who are higher in </v>

774
00:38:38.351 --> 00:38:40.330
<v Speaker 3>neuroticism would be more likely to miss</v>
<v Speaker 3>work,</v>

775
00:38:40.890 --> 00:38:41.830
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

776
00:38:41.890 --> 00:38:44.310
<v Speaker 3>but general cognitive ability for </v>
<v Speaker 3>example,</v>

777
00:38:44.311 --> 00:38:45.144
<v Speaker 3>is not a good predictor at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'll predict how fast you learn the </v>

778
00:38:47.471 --> 00:38:49.870
<v Speaker 3>tasks initially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not how well you perform the test,</v>

779
00:38:50.170 --> 00:38:52.630
<v Speaker 3>but if the task to you're doing are </v>
<v Speaker 3>shifting constantly,</v>

780
00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:53.553
<v Speaker 3>so your responsibilities change or </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in a creative job where you're </v>

781
00:38:57.130 --> 00:38:59.890
<v Speaker 3>constantly solving new problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So those are kind of the same thing.</v>

782
00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:04.090
<v Speaker 3>Then Iq,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as the complexity of the job increases,</v>

783
00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:08.950
<v Speaker 3>the predictive utility of Iq increases,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is only to say that smarter people</v>

784
00:39:08.951 --> 00:39:09.784
<v Speaker 3>can handle complex situations faster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's doesn't seem like a </v>

785
00:39:12.761 --> 00:39:13.594
<v Speaker 3>particularly radical claim.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So price's law dictates that there's </v>

786
00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:19.390
<v Speaker 3>massive individual productivity </v>
<v Speaker 3>differences between people.</v>

787
00:39:19.391 --> 00:39:23.200
<v Speaker 3>So increasing your predictive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your capacity for predicting performance</v>

788
00:39:23.201 --> 00:39:26.450
<v Speaker 3>even by small increments,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has a huge economic consequence.</v>

789
00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:27.293
<v Speaker 3>That was established in the 19 nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The equations were first developed in </v>

790
00:39:29.891 --> 00:39:30.724
<v Speaker 3>the 19 nineties and that's part of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason that I started working on </v>

791
00:39:32.921 --> 00:39:35.950
<v Speaker 3>performance prediction tests because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>read the economics and I thought,</v>

792
00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:37.053
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can produce a test that costs $30 </v>

793
00:39:40.421 --> 00:39:41.380
<v Speaker 3>times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say Baby,</v>

794
00:39:41.381 --> 00:39:45.220
<v Speaker 3>you have 50 applicants for the position,</v>
<v Speaker 3>$1,500 to administer,</v>

795
00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:46.323
<v Speaker 3>and it'll produce an increments of </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like 30 percent of salary </v>

796
00:39:49.661 --> 00:39:52.300
<v Speaker 3>permanently for the person that you put </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a position.</v>

797
00:39:52.330 --> 00:39:53.163
<v Speaker 3>So let's say you hire a $75,000 employee</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it increases their productivity by </v>

798
00:39:57.521 --> 00:40:00.310
<v Speaker 3>30 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we'll say roughly $25,000,</v>

799
00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:05.230
<v Speaker 3>you'll get a $25,000 return on a $1,500 </v>
<v Speaker 3>investment every single year.</v>

800
00:40:05.231 --> 00:40:08.110
<v Speaker 3>That person occupies the position on </v>
<v Speaker 3>average,</v>

801
00:40:08.111 --> 00:40:08.944
<v Speaker 3>that's four years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's $100,000 payoff for your $1,500 </v>

802
00:40:11.791 --> 00:40:13.120
<v Speaker 3>investment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read that.</v>

803
00:40:13.121 --> 00:40:14.050
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

804
00:40:14.770 --> 00:40:17.290
<v Speaker 3>that'll be easy to sell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like wrong.</v>

805
00:40:17.410 --> 00:40:18.243
<v Speaker 3>Wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even though the economic payoff was so </v>

806
00:40:20.021 --> 00:40:20.854
<v Speaker 3>massive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I told you the other impediments that </v>

807
00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:23.890
<v Speaker 3>did emerge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>

808
00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:25.033
<v Speaker 3>the arithmetic or the capacity to </v>
<v Speaker 3>produce these calculations was </v>

809
00:40:28.811 --> 00:40:32.230
<v Speaker 3>established in the 19 nineties and I'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>show you the equations in a bit here.</v>

810
00:40:32.850 --> 00:40:35.590
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we already talked about what a normal</v>

811
00:40:35.591 --> 00:40:36.424
<v Speaker 3>distribution looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the red line and a normal </v>

812
00:40:38.741 --> 00:40:41.830
<v Speaker 3>distribution emerges as a consequence of</v>
<v Speaker 3>chance processes.</v>

813
00:40:42.070 --> 00:40:45.310
<v Speaker 3>So we'll take a look at those here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hopefully this will work.</v>

814
00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:47.553
<v Speaker 3>Look at that.</v>

815
00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:29.880
<v Speaker 3>So there's your corporate advertisement </v>
<v Speaker 3>for the day,</v>

816
00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:33.270
<v Speaker 3>but it's not often you see a heroic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>normal distribution,</v>

817
00:42:33.271 --> 00:42:34.230
<v Speaker 3>but they're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>

818
00:42:34.530 --> 00:42:35.670
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

819
00:42:35.850 --> 00:42:36.683
<v Speaker 3>so what you see is that you get a </v>
<v Speaker 3>pattern output as a consequence of </v>

820
00:42:39.751 --> 00:42:40.584
<v Speaker 3>chance processes and so where you </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened to be on the distribution for </v>

821
00:42:43.261 --> 00:42:46.410
<v Speaker 3>all of the traits that we've described </v>
<v Speaker 3>as a consequence of innumerable chance,</v>

822
00:42:46.411 --> 00:42:47.244
<v Speaker 3>genetic genetic and cultural processes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But a lot of them are a lot more than </v>

823
00:42:50.611 --> 00:42:51.444
<v Speaker 3>people like to admit her genetic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you can make people stupid or </v>

824
00:42:54.361 --> 00:42:55.194
<v Speaker 3>with the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not that easy to make them </v>

825
00:42:56.311 --> 00:42:58.740
<v Speaker 3>smarter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So because it's what I think about it,</v>

826
00:42:58.741 --> 00:42:59.574
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's way easier to make something worse </v>

827
00:43:00.331 --> 00:43:03.780
<v Speaker 3>than it is to make something better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so even if you take everyone and you</v>

828
00:43:03.781 --> 00:43:08.781
<v Speaker 3>give them optimal access to information </v>
<v Speaker 3>and say optimal nutrition,</v>

829
00:43:09.301 --> 00:43:11.820
<v Speaker 3>which pretty much everybody's in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>position now,</v>

830
00:43:11.821 --> 00:43:12.654
<v Speaker 3>at least in so far as we can manage it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get massive genetic </v>

831
00:43:15.481 --> 00:43:16.314
<v Speaker 3>differences in such things as </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscientiousness or extroversion or </v>

832
00:43:18.631 --> 00:43:20.250
<v Speaker 3>intelligence as you would.</v>

833
00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:21.113
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you flatten out the sociocultural </v>

834
00:43:23.161 --> 00:43:23.994
<v Speaker 3>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say you take everybody and you provide </v>

835
00:43:25.501 --> 00:43:28.290
<v Speaker 3>them with optimal nutrition and optimal </v>
<v Speaker 3>access to information,</v>

836
00:43:28.410 --> 00:43:30.750
<v Speaker 3>which you've pretty much done by the way</v>
<v Speaker 3>with a computer,</v>

837
00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:31.823
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because how are you going to give </v>

838
00:43:32.191 --> 00:43:36.840
<v Speaker 3>someone more access to information than </v>
<v Speaker 3>to give them a web enabled computer?</v>

839
00:43:37.050 --> 00:43:38.340
<v Speaker 3>That's it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

840
00:43:38.370 --> 00:43:40.050
<v Speaker 3>There's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's just no better.</v>

841
00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:43.470
<v Speaker 3>It's an infinite library.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can learn anything with it.</v>

842
00:43:43.770 --> 00:43:44.603
<v Speaker 3>So we're done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've equalized the education landscape </v>

843
00:43:46.681 --> 00:43:49.200
<v Speaker 3>roughly speaking and then nutritionally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

844
00:43:49.201 --> 00:43:50.034
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

845
00:43:50.070 --> 00:43:52.080
<v Speaker 3>some people eat badly and some people </v>
<v Speaker 3>eat better,</v>

846
00:43:52.081 --> 00:43:52.914
<v Speaker 3>but the option to eat well is basically </v>
<v Speaker 3>open to at least everybody in North </v>

847
00:43:56.310 --> 00:43:57.150
<v Speaker 3>America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Roughly speaking,</v>

848
00:43:57.420 --> 00:44:00.570
<v Speaker 3>you've wiped out the social socio </v>
<v Speaker 3>cultural variation.</v>

849
00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:01.411
<v Speaker 3>You might think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

850
00:44:01.411 --> 00:44:03.240
<v Speaker 3>that equalizes people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's wrong.</v>

851
00:44:03.270 --> 00:44:07.110
<v Speaker 3>All it does is reduce the variability to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the remaining biological differences.</v>

852
00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:12.260
<v Speaker 3>You maximize the genetic variability by </v>
<v Speaker 3>minimizing the socio variability,</v>

853
00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:13.350
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

854
00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:14.183
<v Speaker 3>Very important thing to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is why the gender differences </v>

855
00:44:17.551 --> 00:44:18.384
<v Speaker 3>between personality between men and </v>
<v Speaker 3>women are largest in the Scandinavian </v>

856
00:44:20.911 --> 00:44:21.744
<v Speaker 3>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tens of thousands of people have been </v>

857
00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:24.413
<v Speaker 3>assessed along these dimensions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know that we know the data that have </v>

858
00:44:27.631 --> 00:44:28.464
<v Speaker 3>come in are clear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The biggest differences between men and </v>

859
00:44:30.421 --> 00:44:31.254
<v Speaker 3>women in the in terms of personality and</v>
<v Speaker 3>in terms of interest are in the </v>

860
00:44:34.081 --> 00:44:37.950
<v Speaker 3>Scandinavian countries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why wiped out sociocultural variation?</v>

861
00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:40.050
<v Speaker 3>All you've got left is biological </v>
<v Speaker 3>differences,</v>

862
00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:41.650
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

863
00:44:41.770 --> 00:44:42.603
<v Speaker 3>so well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can draw your own conclusions from </v>

864
00:44:44.401 --> 00:44:45.234
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's unfortunate and fortunate at the </v>

865
00:44:48.481 --> 00:44:49.650
<v Speaker 3>same time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

866
00:44:49.651 --> 00:44:52.170
<v Speaker 3>so here's a parade distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the distribution.</v>

867
00:44:52.350 --> 00:44:53.183
<v Speaker 3>Remember I showed you with the creative </v>
<v Speaker 3>achievement questionnaire that almost </v>

868
00:44:54.811 --> 00:44:58.380
<v Speaker 3>everybody stacked up at zero,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people have zero creative output,</v>

869
00:44:58.500 --> 00:44:59.333
<v Speaker 3>the median person has zero lifetime </v>
<v Speaker 3>creative output and then there's a tiny </v>

870
00:45:02.341 --> 00:45:06.540
<v Speaker 3>proportion that are way the hell out on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the right hand end of the distribution,</v>

871
00:45:06.541 --> 00:45:07.374
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are the people have who have </v>

872
00:45:08.250 --> 00:45:12.180
<v Speaker 3>everything is cycling forward for them </v>
<v Speaker 3>and as they get more well known,</v>

873
00:45:12.450 --> 00:45:14.760
<v Speaker 3>of course they get more opportunities as</v>
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

874
00:45:17.010 --> 00:45:17.650
<v Speaker 3>Con,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cut.</v>

875
00:45:17.650 --> 00:45:20.150
<v Speaker 3>Person's very conscientious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I just,</v>

876
00:45:20.151 --> 00:45:22.340
<v Speaker 3>I'll just run this simulation for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

877
00:45:22.341 --> 00:45:25.270
<v Speaker 3>And this shows you why the distribution </v>
<v Speaker 3>emerges.</v>

878
00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:28.850
<v Speaker 3>Now you have to watch this quickly </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's a fairly fast animation.</v>

879
00:45:28.851 --> 00:45:31.940
<v Speaker 3>So here's what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody starts out with $10.</v>

880
00:45:32.090 --> 00:45:33.920
<v Speaker 3>There's a thousand people playing the </v>
<v Speaker 3>game.</v>

881
00:45:33.921 --> 00:45:37.400
<v Speaker 3>Everybody starts out with $10.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have a dollar,</v>

882
00:45:37.401 --> 00:45:38.600
<v Speaker 3>you have a dollar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I flip a coin.</v>

883
00:45:38.601 --> 00:45:40.070
<v Speaker 3>If I get heads,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you give me a dollar.</v>

884
00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:42.050
<v Speaker 3>If I get tails,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I give you a daughter.</v>

885
00:45:42.051 --> 00:45:44.390
<v Speaker 3>We go around and we trade with everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

886
00:45:44.391 --> 00:45:45.224
<v Speaker 3>So the first thing that happens when </v>
<v Speaker 3>people start to trade is this normal </v>

887
00:45:49.041 --> 00:45:50.420
<v Speaker 3>distribution develops,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

888
00:45:50.421 --> 00:45:51.254
<v Speaker 3>Because some people lose and some people</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it's just like the Golden Board </v>

889
00:45:53.481 --> 00:45:54.650
<v Speaker 3>that I showed you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

890
00:45:54.651 --> 00:45:55.484
<v Speaker 3>so you keep playing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People start to stack up at zero watch </v>

891
00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:01.880
<v Speaker 3>because they lose 10 times in a row,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bang,</v>

892
00:46:01.881 --> 00:46:02.714
<v Speaker 3>they're done.</v>

893
00:46:06.990 --> 00:46:09.810
<v Speaker 3>The bottom graph is a graph of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>entropy of the distribution,</v>

894
00:46:09.811 --> 00:46:10.644
<v Speaker 3>which increases as the game continues</v>
<v Speaker 3>because at the beginning it's maximally </v>

895
00:46:14.821 --> 00:46:15.451
<v Speaker 3>ordered,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

896
00:46:15.451 --> 00:46:18.630
<v Speaker 3>Everybody has exactly the same amount.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it's being distributed.</v>

897
00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:23.010
<v Speaker 3>Same equations apply to the distribution</v>
<v Speaker 3>of gas into a vacuum.</v>

898
00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:25.890
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happens now,</v>

899
00:46:25.891 --> 00:46:27.980
<v Speaker 3>someone you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are people out there at the,</v>

900
00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:31.230
<v Speaker 3>at the $50 range or at the $60 range,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the $70 range.</v>

901
00:46:31.231 --> 00:46:34.590
<v Speaker 3>You keep playing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well eventually what happens if you play</v>

902
00:46:34.591 --> 00:46:37.650
<v Speaker 3>it right to its conclusion is that one </v>
<v Speaker 3>person ends up with all the money,</v>

903
00:46:38.070 --> 00:46:38.903
<v Speaker 3>so that's to those who have everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>more will be given from those who have </v>

904
00:46:42.031 --> 00:46:43.500
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything will be taken.</v>

905
00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:44.513
<v Speaker 3>That's the law of economic productivity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called Matthew is the matthew </v>

906
00:46:47.290 --> 00:46:51.030
<v Speaker 3>principle and it's actually an economic </v>
<v Speaker 3>principle that was derived from a saying</v>

907
00:46:51.031 --> 00:46:51.864
<v Speaker 3>in the New Testament.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you some more about this on </v>

908
00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:56.490
<v Speaker 3>Tuesday because I didn't get through all</v>
<v Speaker 3>of it and I want to.</v>

909
00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:01.880
<v Speaker 3>I want to finish up the performance </v>
<v Speaker 3>prediction lecture and show you a couple</v>

910
00:47:01.921 --> 00:47:03.210
<v Speaker 3>of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't get to show you</v>

911
00:47:05.550 --> 00:47:06.383
<v Speaker 3>the last time that we talked and then I </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to do the closing lecture since </v>

912
00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:11.993
<v Speaker 3>we're done today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we'll start with the performance </v>

913
00:47:16.621 --> 00:47:17.454
<v Speaker 3>prediction and so I've been thinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>more about this prieto distribution </v>

914
00:47:21.151 --> 00:47:24.720
<v Speaker 3>issue because it's a really big deal and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's difficult.</v>

915
00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:26.670
<v Speaker 3>It's still difficult for me to </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand and see.</v>

916
00:47:26.671 --> 00:47:28.650
<v Speaker 3>I didn't really learn about this about </v>
<v Speaker 3>10 years ago,</v>

917
00:47:28.651 --> 00:47:30.220
<v Speaker 3>which is quite a shock to me because</v>

918
00:47:30.550 --> 00:47:31.383
<v Speaker 2>it's such a fundamental phenomenon that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me that it would have been </v>

919
00:47:34.151 --> 00:47:36.940
<v Speaker 2>addressed in my training somewhere along</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way and so</v>

920
00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:40.113
<v Speaker 2>and so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm still thinking it through what it </v>

921
00:47:40.871 --> 00:47:41.800
<v Speaker 2>means exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

922
00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:43.930
<v Speaker 2>here's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's an interesting thing.</v>

923
00:47:44.050 --> 00:47:47.230
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Iq is normally distributed and it's</v>

924
00:47:47.231 --> 00:47:48.064
<v Speaker 2>a good predictor of long term </v>
<v Speaker 2>performance and conscientiousness is </v>

925
00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:54.890
<v Speaker 2>normally distributed and it's a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>predictor of longterm performance and an</v>

926
00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:55.733
<v Speaker 2>openness is also normally distributed </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's a good predictor of creative </v>

927
00:47:59.411 --> 00:48:00.244
<v Speaker 2>behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but creative output is not normally </v>

928
00:48:02.981 --> 00:48:03.814
<v Speaker 2>distributed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's distributed in this weird prieto </v>

929
00:48:05.111 --> 00:48:05.944
<v Speaker 2>distribution that that's indexed here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I showed you that with the creative </v>

930
00:48:08.801 --> 00:48:09.634
<v Speaker 2>achievement questionnaire most </v>
<v Speaker 2>specifically because that provides a </v>

931
00:48:11.261 --> 00:48:13.550
<v Speaker 2>really concrete example of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

932
00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:15.213
<v Speaker 2>so it looks like the capacity to think </v>
<v Speaker 2>creatively might be normally </v>

933
00:48:17.771 --> 00:48:18.604
<v Speaker 2>distributed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be openness say and </v>

934
00:48:19.601 --> 00:48:20.434
<v Speaker 2>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the consequence of that turns into </v>

935
00:48:22.751 --> 00:48:24.310
<v Speaker 2>this strange prieto distribution.</v>

936
00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:27.970
<v Speaker 2>And the credo distribution with regards </v>
<v Speaker 2>to creative achievement was best.</v>

937
00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:29.223
<v Speaker 2>The catastrophe of it in some senses </v>
<v Speaker 2>best indexed by the fact that if I </v>

938
00:48:33.131 --> 00:48:33.964
<v Speaker 2>remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>70 percent of people who complete the </v>

939
00:48:36.701 --> 00:48:37.534
<v Speaker 2>creative achievement questionnaire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which indexes lifetime creativity score </v>

940
00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:44.650
<v Speaker 2>zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So zero is a strange number.</v>

941
00:48:44.670 --> 00:48:46.450
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>zero isn't like other numbers.</v>

942
00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:47.613
<v Speaker 2>And the part of the reason for that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's difficult to do anything with </v>

943
00:48:51.161 --> 00:48:52.710
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

944
00:48:52.910 --> 00:48:55.300
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you buy a stock and the and the price</v>

945
00:48:55.301 --> 00:48:59.140
<v Speaker 2>sinks to like two cents a stock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're still alive.</v>

946
00:48:59.170 --> 00:49:01.600
<v Speaker 2>But if the price sinks to zero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're done.</v>

947
00:49:01.630 --> 00:49:02.463
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

948
00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:05.390
<v Speaker 2>The game's over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the thing about zero when you</v>

949
00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:08.680
<v Speaker 2>hit zero or maybe when you're at zero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the game is over.</v>

950
00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:10.150
<v Speaker 2>And when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

951
00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:15.010
<v Speaker 2>when we were attempting to market,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

952
00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:18.790
<v Speaker 2>the tests that we had designed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>predict performance in companies,</v>

953
00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:19.863
<v Speaker 2>one of the big obstacles to begin with </v>
<v Speaker 2>was having zero customers and zero </v>

954
00:49:22.841 --> 00:49:25.300
<v Speaker 2>customers is really the wrong number of </v>
<v Speaker 2>customers to have.</v>

955
00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:28.990
<v Speaker 2>And there's a big difference between </v>
<v Speaker 2>zero customers then one customer,</v>

956
00:49:29.020 --> 00:49:30.430
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because then you're in the game.</v>

957
00:49:30.431 --> 00:49:31.264
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's these weird barriers to </v>

958
00:49:32.921 --> 00:49:34.690
<v Speaker 2>moving forward in life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you see this,</v>

959
00:49:34.691 --> 00:49:36.790
<v Speaker 2>there's a poverty trap that's sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like this too.</v>

960
00:49:36.791 --> 00:49:37.624
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're so broke that you can't keep </v>

961
00:49:39.221 --> 00:49:41.500
<v Speaker 2>up with paying your bills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really,</v>

962
00:49:41.501 --> 00:49:44.230
<v Speaker 2>really difficult to get out of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you can't get a bank account,</v>

963
00:49:44.231 --> 00:49:46.150
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can't pay your rent.</v>

964
00:49:46.610 --> 00:49:47.950
<v Speaker 2>And there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

965
00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:48.823
<v Speaker 2>there's economies of scale that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't take advantage of because you </v>

966
00:49:51.611 --> 00:49:55.060
<v Speaker 2>don't have any money at all and so you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't get going in the game.</v>

967
00:49:55.510 --> 00:49:58.300
<v Speaker 2>And then so there's the problem of </v>
<v Speaker 2>starting out with zero,</v>

968
00:49:58.301 --> 00:50:00.700
<v Speaker 2>which is a big problem and very </v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult to get out of.</v>

969
00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:01.713
<v Speaker 2>And then there's the problem of falling </v>
<v Speaker 2>to zero if you are in the game because </v>

970
00:50:04.211 --> 00:50:05.044
<v Speaker 2>when you fall to zero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's very difficult to get going </v>

971
00:50:06.641 --> 00:50:07.474
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

972
00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:09.370
<v Speaker 2>And so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

973
00:50:09.371 --> 00:50:14.260
<v Speaker 2>so now I want to show you something </v>
<v Speaker 2>about how,</v>

974
00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:16.740
<v Speaker 2>how trading games work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

975
00:50:18.790 --> 00:50:21.070
<v Speaker 2>so I think we stopped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we closed with this last time,</v>

976
00:50:21.071 --> 00:50:21.904
<v Speaker 2>but so this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a graph that shows you how a </v>

977
00:50:24.911 --> 00:50:25.744
<v Speaker 2>monopoly game starts roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you could say this is how you would </v>

978
00:50:28.341 --> 00:50:30.350
<v Speaker 2>set up the world if you wanted perfect </v>
<v Speaker 2>equity.</v>

979
00:50:30.351 --> 00:50:32.150
<v Speaker 2>If you wanted everybody to have the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>outcome,</v>

980
00:50:32.151 --> 00:50:34.640
<v Speaker 2>everybody would have the same amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

981
00:50:34.641 --> 00:50:39.080
<v Speaker 2>In this case it's $10.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's dollars along the,</v>

982
00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:40.033
<v Speaker 2>along the bottom axis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's number of players along the </v>

983
00:50:42.891 --> 00:50:43.880
<v Speaker 2>lefthand day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oxys.</v>

984
00:50:43.881 --> 00:50:45.950
<v Speaker 2>And you can think about this as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>monopoly game.</v>

985
00:50:45.951 --> 00:50:46.784
<v Speaker 2>Everybody starts with the same amount of</v>
<v Speaker 2>money and then you start trading </v>

986
00:50:48.441 --> 00:50:51.500
<v Speaker 2>randomly and you know if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

987
00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:54.410
<v Speaker 2>if you have $10 in your trading,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a dollar each trade,</v>

988
00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:56.053
<v Speaker 2>if you have enough people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some unlucky person is going to end up </v>

989
00:50:57.591 --> 00:51:00.200
<v Speaker 2>with $0 after 10 traits.</v>

990
00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:03.260
<v Speaker 2>And if they end up with $1 after nine </v>
<v Speaker 2>trades,</v>

991
00:51:03.261 --> 00:51:05.780
<v Speaker 2>they still have the chance of recovery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a low chance,</v>

992
00:51:05.781 --> 00:51:08.090
<v Speaker 2>but it's not zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But once they hit zero,</v>

993
00:51:08.091 --> 00:51:08.924
<v Speaker 2>they're out of the game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what happens is if you run this </v>

994
00:51:10.431 --> 00:51:13.550
<v Speaker 2>simulation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have people flip a coin to determine</v>

995
00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:16.280
<v Speaker 2>how they're going to trade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then this is what happened.</v>

996
00:51:16.281 --> 00:51:17.114
<v Speaker 2>So the first thing that happens is you </v>
<v Speaker 2>generate a normal distribution because </v>

997
00:51:19.941 --> 00:51:20.774
<v Speaker 2>some people win and some people lose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And most people sort of half women and </v>

998
00:51:23.481 --> 00:51:25.400
<v Speaker 2>half lose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But some lose continually.</v>

999
00:51:25.401 --> 00:51:26.234
<v Speaker 2>And some wind continually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it turns into a normal </v>

1000
00:51:27.801 --> 00:51:29.390
<v Speaker 2>distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.</v>

1001
00:51:29.391 --> 00:51:31.790
<v Speaker 2>But then when the game continues to </v>
<v Speaker 2>play,</v>

1002
00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:36.350
<v Speaker 2>then what happens is that people start </v>
<v Speaker 2>to stack up on the zero end of things.</v>

1003
00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:37.273
<v Speaker 2>And a tiny proportion at the upper end </v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you play the game right to </v>

1004
00:51:40.510 --> 00:51:41.780
<v Speaker 2>cessation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what you do,</v>

1005
00:51:41.781 --> 00:51:43.730
<v Speaker 2>if you play monopoly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1006
00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:46.400
<v Speaker 2>somebody ends up with all the money.</v>

1007
00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:48.980
<v Speaker 2>And the funny thing about playing </v>
<v Speaker 2>monopoly as you know,</v>

1008
00:51:49.010 --> 00:51:50.990
<v Speaker 2>if you've played monopoly multiple </v>
<v Speaker 2>times,</v>

1009
00:51:50.991 --> 00:51:54.980
<v Speaker 2>is that the probability that you'll win </v>
<v Speaker 2>continually across games is pretty low.</v>

1010
00:51:55.320 --> 00:51:56.153
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of randomness in monopoly </v>

1011
00:51:57.471 --> 00:51:59.330
<v Speaker 2>and if you play with the same five </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

1012
00:51:59.570 --> 00:52:01.520
<v Speaker 2>10 games,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the probability is pretty good.</v>

1013
00:52:01.521 --> 00:52:03.110
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to win more than two </v>
<v Speaker 2>games.</v>

1014
00:52:03.470 --> 00:52:04.303
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's chance elements that come </v>

1015
00:52:06.321 --> 00:52:09.500
<v Speaker 2>into play that determine the outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so anyways,</v>

1016
00:52:09.501 --> 00:52:10.334
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking about this more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit more last night and </v>

1017
00:52:13.011 --> 00:52:15.530
<v Speaker 2>somebody asked me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was talking about it with somebody and</v>

1018
00:52:15.531 --> 00:52:16.364
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he asked me if the Prieto distribution </v>

1019
00:52:18.350 --> 00:52:23.350
<v Speaker 2>was a necessary consequence of the fact </v>
<v Speaker 2>that production is number one measured.</v>

1020
00:52:24.050 --> 00:52:25.520
<v Speaker 2>And number two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>social.</v>

1021
00:52:26.090 --> 00:52:26.923
<v Speaker 2>And that's that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought that was really interesting </v>

1022
00:52:28.191 --> 00:52:29.024
<v Speaker 2>question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1023
00:52:29.330 --> 00:52:30.163
<v Speaker 2>do you get a prieto distribution every </v>
<v Speaker 2>time creative output ends up being </v>

1024
00:52:33.861 --> 00:52:35.030
<v Speaker 2>measured in some way.</v>

1025
00:52:35.330 --> 00:52:38.790
<v Speaker 2>And even if you can conceptualize it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so because it might be the,</v>

1026
00:52:38.791 --> 00:52:43.791
<v Speaker 2>the idea might be that anything that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can assign monetary value to is first of</v>

1027
00:52:44.061 --> 00:52:44.894
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is something you can measure because </v>

1028
00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:49.430
<v Speaker 2>assigning monetary value to something is</v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact measuring it,</v>

1029
00:52:49.431 --> 00:52:50.264
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're measuring it with money and then </v>

1030
00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:53.720
<v Speaker 2>as soon as you assign a monetary value </v>
<v Speaker 2>to it,</v>

1031
00:52:53.721 --> 00:52:55.010
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can trade,</v>

1032
00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:55.873
<v Speaker 2>you can trade it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it also takes on some aspects of a </v>

1033
00:52:57.771 --> 00:52:58.604
<v Speaker 2>zero sum game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And most of the things that we talked </v>

1034
00:53:00.351 --> 00:53:01.184
<v Speaker 2>about with regards to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the production of Prieto distributions </v>

1035
00:53:05.121 --> 00:53:09.230
<v Speaker 2>were measured entities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we're,</v>

1036
00:53:09.231 --> 00:53:11.720
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

1037
00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:15.320
<v Speaker 2>we're trading games as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So even because I mentioned to you,</v>

1038
00:53:15.321 --> 00:53:17.650
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that number of,</v>

1039
00:53:17.890 --> 00:53:18.723
<v Speaker 2>of basketball hoops successfully managed</v>
<v Speaker 2>it by NBA players is praetor </v>

1040
00:53:23.430 --> 00:53:25.070
<v Speaker 2>distributed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's also,</v>

1041
00:53:25.170 --> 00:53:26.130
<v Speaker 2>those are measurable with</v>

1042
00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:28.440
<v Speaker 3>money because of course you get paid to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do it and it's,</v>

1043
00:53:28.550 --> 00:53:29.383
<v Speaker 3>it is a social game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so maybe it is an inevitable </v>

1044
00:53:31.201 --> 00:53:34.650
<v Speaker 3>consequence of trading in a social game </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you produce preload cubs.</v>

1045
00:53:34.651 --> 00:53:35.484
<v Speaker 3>And then I was trying to figure out why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I've also always had this suspicion </v>

1046
00:53:39.031 --> 00:53:42.540
<v Speaker 3>that what happens to people is that as </v>
<v Speaker 3>they move toward zero,</v>

1047
00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:45.870
<v Speaker 3>positive feedback loops get set up so </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're more likely to hit zero.</v>

1048
00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:46.913
<v Speaker 3>And as they move away from zero positive</v>
<v Speaker 3>feedback loops get set up so that </v>

1049
00:53:49.351 --> 00:53:52.050
<v Speaker 3>they're increasingly more likely to move</v>
<v Speaker 3>away from zero.</v>

1050
00:53:52.290 --> 00:53:55.830
<v Speaker 3>So here's an example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say you're not doing too bad,</v>

1051
00:53:55.831 --> 00:53:57.540
<v Speaker 3>so maybe you're in the middle of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>normal distribution,</v>

1052
00:53:57.541 --> 00:54:00.060
<v Speaker 3>then you lose your job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

1053
00:54:00.061 --> 00:54:00.894
<v Speaker 3>And so let's say you're a conscientious </v>
<v Speaker 3>person and we could say just for the </v>

1054
00:54:05.161 --> 00:54:05.994
<v Speaker 3>sake of argument,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you lose your job because of mass </v>

1055
00:54:07.261 --> 00:54:08.310
<v Speaker 3>layoffs in your company.</v>

1056
00:54:08.310 --> 00:54:10.770
<v Speaker 3>So it has nothing to do with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fundamentally,</v>

1057
00:54:10.771 --> 00:54:14.040
<v Speaker 3>it's just luck of the draw basically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then what happens to you?</v>

1058
00:54:14.070 --> 00:54:16.890
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're conscientious,</v>

1059
00:54:16.891 --> 00:54:17.820
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna.</v>

1060
00:54:17.850 --> 00:54:20.080
<v Speaker 3>Go after yourself pretty hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're going to,</v>

1061
00:54:20.850 --> 00:54:22.800
<v Speaker 3>especially if you're also high in </v>
<v Speaker 3>neuroticism,</v>

1062
00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:24.540
<v Speaker 3>it's going to depress you to lose your </v>
<v Speaker 3>job.</v>

1063
00:54:24.541 --> 00:54:26.580
<v Speaker 3>And maybe you're in a situation where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you just,</v>

1064
00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:27.653
<v Speaker 3>for one reason or another,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have that many other </v>

1065
00:54:28.741 --> 00:54:30.720
<v Speaker 3>opportunities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now maybe you should look for them,</v>

1066
00:54:30.721 --> 00:54:31.554
<v Speaker 3>but maybe you're in a depressed state of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the economy or you're geographically </v>

1067
00:54:34.861 --> 00:54:37.920
<v Speaker 3>located somewhere that makes moving </v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult or so on and so forth.</v>

1068
00:54:37.921 --> 00:54:38.731
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

1069
00:54:38.731 --> 00:54:42.630
<v Speaker 3>but you lose a job and then you start to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get depressed because of that.</v>

1070
00:54:43.230 --> 00:54:45.090
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then as you start to get depressed,</v>

1071
00:54:45.500 --> 00:54:48.240
<v Speaker 3>you know it decreases the probability </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're going to look for a job,</v>

1072
00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:49.313
<v Speaker 3>but also maybe starts to put stress on </v>
<v Speaker 3>your family and it also starts to </v>

1073
00:54:52.351 --> 00:54:53.184
<v Speaker 3>decrease the probability that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to engage in positive social </v>

1074
00:54:55.441 --> 00:54:56.010
<v Speaker 3>interaction.</v>

1075
00:54:56.010 --> 00:54:59.910
<v Speaker 3>So now not only are you unemployed and </v>
<v Speaker 3>suffering from economic stress,</v>

1076
00:54:59.911 --> 00:55:00.744
<v Speaker 3>but your marriage is starting to suffer </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're starting to isolate yourself </v>

1077
00:55:03.661 --> 00:55:04.890
<v Speaker 3>from your friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then of course,</v>

1078
00:55:04.891 --> 00:55:06.960
<v Speaker 3>as your marriage suffers in the stress </v>
<v Speaker 3>builds up,</v>

1079
00:55:07.260 --> 00:55:08.093
<v Speaker 3>then that's gonna make you more </v>
<v Speaker 3>depressed and that's going to keep you </v>

1080
00:55:09.571 --> 00:55:10.404
<v Speaker 3>even farther away from your friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's going to decrease the </v>

1081
00:55:11.851 --> 00:55:12.684
<v Speaker 3>likelihood that you're going to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>enough positive emotion and enthusiasm </v>

1082
00:55:15.271 --> 00:55:17.130
<v Speaker 3>to look for another job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

1083
00:55:17.260 --> 00:55:18.093
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe you want to add a bit of a </v>

1084
00:55:18.661 --> 00:55:19.494
<v Speaker 3>drinking problem too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That just for fun and you can see that </v>

1085
00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:24.540
<v Speaker 3>you can get a spiral going that's just </v>
<v Speaker 3>taken you down.</v>

1086
00:55:25.020 --> 00:55:25.853
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's all sorts of things because </v>

1087
00:55:27.181 --> 00:55:28.014
<v Speaker 3>lots of times people conceptualize,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say you're unemployed guide and </v>

1088
00:55:32.251 --> 00:55:33.084
<v Speaker 3>you go to counseling and you get a </v>
<v Speaker 3>diagnosis of depression and the thing </v>

1089
00:55:38.131 --> 00:55:38.964
<v Speaker 3>about a diagnosis of depression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of like the assumption is </v>

1090
00:55:41.041 --> 00:55:43.710
<v Speaker 3>there's something gone wrong with your </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychological structure.</v>

1091
00:55:43.710 --> 00:55:45.710
<v Speaker 3>It's like if you're unemployed and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1092
00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:48.120
<v Speaker 3>you're depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It isn't obvious at all that the problem</v>

1093
00:55:48.121 --> 00:55:50.430
<v Speaker 3>is in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1094
00:55:50.431 --> 00:55:51.140
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't.</v>

1095
00:55:51.140 --> 00:55:53.580
<v Speaker 3>It isn't even obvious that it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychological problem.</v>

1096
00:55:53.820 --> 00:55:56.940
<v Speaker 3>It's just a problem and problems can </v>
<v Speaker 3>take you out.</v>

1097
00:55:57.390 --> 00:55:58.810
<v Speaker 3>And so the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1098
00:55:58.830 --> 00:55:59.663
<v Speaker 3>if you're unemployed and you're under </v>
<v Speaker 3>economic stress and your marriage is </v>

1099
00:56:02.131 --> 00:56:02.964
<v Speaker 3>starting to shake and you're isolating </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself from your friends and you're </v>

1100
00:56:05.941 --> 00:56:08.130
<v Speaker 3>less likely to be motivated to go look </v>
<v Speaker 3>for a job.</v>

1101
00:56:08.430 --> 00:56:10.890
<v Speaker 3>You can sort of think about that as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>depressive spiral,</v>

1102
00:56:10.891 --> 00:56:11.724
<v Speaker 3>but you can also think of it as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>conspiracy in some sense of external </v>

1103
00:56:15.211 --> 00:56:16.044
<v Speaker 3>forces that are auguring you into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ground and we don't tend to </v>

1104
00:56:18.781 --> 00:56:21.660
<v Speaker 3>conceptualize psychological disorders </v>
<v Speaker 3>that way,</v>

1105
00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:26.260
<v Speaker 3>but we should because lots of times when</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are suffering from something that</v>

1106
00:56:26.261 --> 00:56:27.094
<v Speaker 3>you could describe in psychological </v>
<v Speaker 3>terminology and depression is a very </v>

1107
00:56:30.071 --> 00:56:30.910
<v Speaker 3>good example of that.</v>

1108
00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:33.100
<v Speaker 3>It isn't obvious that there's something </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong with them.</v>

1109
00:56:33.101 --> 00:56:37.000
<v Speaker 3>Psychologically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Often they just are in trouble and there</v>

1110
00:56:37.001 --> 00:56:42.001
<v Speaker 3>isn't a category in psychological </v>
<v Speaker 3>diagnosis for client in serious trouble.</v>

1111
00:56:42.250 --> 00:56:43.083
<v Speaker 3>But my experience has been almost </v>
<v Speaker 3>without exception that the people that </v>

1112
00:56:47.650 --> 00:56:51.190
<v Speaker 3>come to see me come to see me because </v>
<v Speaker 3>something's gone wrong with their life.</v>

1113
00:56:51.220 --> 00:56:52.780
<v Speaker 3>Not because they have a psychological </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>

1114
00:56:52.781 --> 00:56:53.710
<v Speaker 3>Now you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1115
00:56:54.170 --> 00:56:57.970
<v Speaker 3>there are psychological inadequacies </v>
<v Speaker 3>such as they might be,</v>

1116
00:56:57.971 --> 00:56:58.804
<v Speaker 3>are interfering with their ability to </v>
<v Speaker 3>recover or maybe even served as </v>

1117
00:57:01.601 --> 00:57:03.150
<v Speaker 3>precursors to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1118
00:57:03.350 --> 00:57:05.380
<v Speaker 3>increase the probability of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>catastrophe,</v>

1119
00:57:05.381 --> 00:57:08.650
<v Speaker 3>but it's still not exactly the </v>
<v Speaker 3>appropriate way to conceptualize it.</v>

1120
00:57:09.020 --> 00:57:10.510
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're,</v>

1121
00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:14.790
<v Speaker 3>you inside you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as a personality psychologist and as</v>

1122
00:57:14.791 --> 00:57:15.624
<v Speaker 3>a clinical theorists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of what I've talked to you guys </v>

1123
00:57:17.381 --> 00:57:18.214
<v Speaker 3>about is your psyche and its structure </v>
<v Speaker 3>as if it was like a soul that inhabited </v>

1124
00:57:22.991 --> 00:57:23.320
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

1125
00:57:23.320 --> 00:57:25.180
<v Speaker 3>And there's some real utility in that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1126
00:57:25.181 --> 00:57:27.670
<v Speaker 3>you're an individual demarcated from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>community.</v>

1127
00:57:27.940 --> 00:57:30.820
<v Speaker 3>You can be set up in a healthy manner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an unhealthy manner.</v>

1128
00:57:31.150 --> 00:57:33.430
<v Speaker 3>The problem with that is that you're not</v>
<v Speaker 3>just an individual,</v>

1129
00:57:33.610 --> 00:57:34.443
<v Speaker 3>you're connected to all these external </v>
<v Speaker 3>network dynamic networks that are </v>

1130
00:57:37.451 --> 00:57:38.530
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really important.</v>

1131
00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:41.230
<v Speaker 3>And it isn't even easy to separate them </v>
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>

1132
00:57:41.231 --> 00:57:42.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you might say,</v>

1133
00:57:42.701 --> 00:57:46.330
<v Speaker 3>well this is especially true once you </v>
<v Speaker 3>become a parent is like,</v>

1134
00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:50.380
<v Speaker 3>is your child more you than your arm?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what you think?</v>

1135
00:57:50.381 --> 00:57:53.050
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty obvious parts of you that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are physically linked,</v>

1136
00:57:53.051 --> 00:57:57.160
<v Speaker 3>our more key to you to you as an entity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's by no means obvious.</v>

1137
00:57:57.161 --> 00:58:01.660
<v Speaker 3>I think many people would much more </v>
<v Speaker 3>happily sacrifice at arm than a child.</v>

1138
00:58:01.710 --> 00:58:02.543
<v Speaker 3>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so your boundaries are not where </v>

1139
00:58:04.481 --> 00:58:05.314
<v Speaker 3>your boundaries are located,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are not precisely isomorphic with the </v>

1140
00:58:08.081 --> 00:58:09.310
<v Speaker 3>outline of your body.</v>

1141
00:58:09.340 --> 00:58:10.173
<v Speaker 3>It's not that simple at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you're embedded in all sorts of </v>

1142
00:58:12.101 --> 00:58:15.700
<v Speaker 3>networks that can pull you down rapidly </v>
<v Speaker 3>or elevate you,</v>

1143
00:58:15.701 --> 00:58:17.710
<v Speaker 3>because the other thing that happens is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1144
00:58:18.430 --> 00:58:19.263
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say I've never traded with anyone </v>

1145
00:58:20.980 --> 00:58:22.720
<v Speaker 3>and I go up to someone and I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1146
00:58:22.721 --> 00:58:24.280
<v Speaker 3>do you want to trade?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they say,</v>

1147
00:58:24.281 --> 00:58:25.450
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>

1148
00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:26.740
<v Speaker 3>How?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How can I trust you?</v>

1149
00:58:27.460 --> 00:58:28.750
<v Speaker 3>And the answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1150
00:58:28.751 --> 00:58:30.850
<v Speaker 3>you have to take my word for it with </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not,</v>

1151
00:58:31.090 --> 00:58:34.000
<v Speaker 3>that's not a very good argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might say,</v>

1152
00:58:34.001 --> 00:58:36.460
<v Speaker 3>instead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well here's what I have to offer and you</v>

1153
00:58:36.461 --> 00:58:38.920
<v Speaker 3>can evaluate it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the person is likely to say,</v>

1154
00:58:38.921 --> 00:58:40.510
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how to evaluate it.</v>

1155
00:58:40.511 --> 00:58:42.480
<v Speaker 3>And so I'm still stuck with taking your </v>
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>

1156
00:58:42.640 --> 00:58:45.190
<v Speaker 3>So that's a bad problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you'll see that if you ever tried to</v>

1157
00:58:45.191 --> 00:58:48.130
<v Speaker 3>sell a product in the marketplace is if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't.</v>

1158
00:58:48.380 --> 00:58:50.680
<v Speaker 3>If if the product is new and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>complex,</v>

1159
00:58:50.681 --> 00:58:51.514
<v Speaker 3>then you're forcing the person that </v>
<v Speaker 3>wants to buy it to evaluate it and then </v>

1160
00:58:54.671 --> 00:58:58.270
<v Speaker 3>you're forcing them to take the risk of </v>
<v Speaker 3>being wrong as well as the time it would</v>

1161
00:58:58.271 --> 00:59:00.340
<v Speaker 3>take to evaluate it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they don't like that.</v>

1162
00:59:00.760 --> 00:59:03.400
<v Speaker 3>What they want is what's often called </v>
<v Speaker 3>social proof,</v>

1163
00:59:03.401 --> 00:59:04.390
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1164
00:59:04.391 --> 00:59:06.520
<v Speaker 3>well you want to trade with me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who else have you traded with?</v>

1165
00:59:06.970 --> 00:59:10.450
<v Speaker 3>And if the answer is zero,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then they are going to say,</v>

1166
00:59:10.750 --> 00:59:11.583
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're an interesting person and all </v>

1167
00:59:12.220 --> 00:59:12.551
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1168
00:59:12.551 --> 00:59:13.384
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got these other people over here </v>

1169
00:59:14.111 --> 00:59:14.944
<v Speaker 3>who have already traded with a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people and therefore the risk is lower </v>

1170
00:59:18.730 --> 00:59:19.563
<v Speaker 3>in part because let's say I have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>supervisor and I'm going to make a </v>

1171
00:59:23.421 --> 00:59:24.254
<v Speaker 3>decision.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And my primary concern is that my </v>

1172
00:59:25.671 --> 00:59:28.190
<v Speaker 3>supervisor will not hate me for making </v>
<v Speaker 3>the decision.</v>

1173
00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:29.233
<v Speaker 3>It's not my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that my primary concern is to make the </v>

1174
00:59:30.711 --> 00:59:33.140
<v Speaker 3>best decision.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not the same thing.</v>

1175
00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:36.740
<v Speaker 3>It's that I want to make a decision that</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to get in trouble for,</v>

1176
00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:38.960
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so how do I do that?</v>

1177
00:59:38.961 --> 00:59:42.500
<v Speaker 3>Because I need a post hoc justification </v>
<v Speaker 3>so I buy something from you and it turns</v>

1178
00:59:42.501 --> 00:59:44.310
<v Speaker 3>out to be terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1179
00:59:44.540 --> 00:59:47.480
<v Speaker 3>and I get called for it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>called on the table for it.</v>

1180
00:59:47.820 --> 00:59:48.860
<v Speaker 3>And what do I say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say,</v>

1181
00:59:48.861 --> 00:59:49.810
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1182
00:59:50.330 --> 00:59:53.000
<v Speaker 3>that person was buying from it and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>person was buying from,</v>

1183
00:59:53.030 --> 00:59:55.190
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from him and that person was buying from</v>

1184
00:59:55.191 --> 00:59:57.650
<v Speaker 3>him like all these other people were </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing the same thing.</v>

1185
00:59:57.920 --> 00:59:58.753
<v Speaker 3>So it's not like the error is localized </v>
<v Speaker 3>in me and that's often a very credible </v>

1186
01:00:02.361 --> 01:00:04.520
<v Speaker 3>story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if the answer is,</v>

1187
01:00:04.521 --> 01:00:05.121
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1188
01:00:05.121 --> 01:00:06.770
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I evaluated it and took A.</v>

1189
01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:07.880
<v Speaker 3>Rick decided to take a risk.</v>

1190
01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:11.070
<v Speaker 3>It's like out the door with you sunny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you know,</v>

1191
01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:12.103
<v Speaker 3>that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's an indication that you're not </v>

1192
01:00:13.461 --> 01:00:14.294
<v Speaker 3>capable of doing that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think part of the reason that </v>

1193
01:00:17.421 --> 01:00:22.421
<v Speaker 3>people spiral downhill into zero is </v>
<v Speaker 3>because Paul positive,</v>

1194
01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:23.893
<v Speaker 3>like a positive feedback loop is a loop </v>
<v Speaker 3>that increases the probability that the </v>

1195
01:00:26.751 --> 01:00:28.520
<v Speaker 3>loop will continue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1196
01:00:28.521 --> 01:00:29.354
<v Speaker 3>A positive feedback loop is you've </v>
<v Speaker 3>experienced this when you hear </v>

1197
01:00:31.311 --> 01:00:33.650
<v Speaker 3>microphone feedback in an amplified </v>
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>

1198
01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:34.933
<v Speaker 3>So you know the microphone sends a </v>
<v Speaker 3>message to the speakers and then the </v>

1199
01:00:38.421 --> 01:00:39.254
<v Speaker 3>speakers send out the message amplified </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then the microphone picks up the </v>

1200
01:00:43.101 --> 01:00:46.850
<v Speaker 3>message and and it gets amplified again </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you get this howling occur,</v>

1201
01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:47.833
<v Speaker 3>which is can be deafening but can also </v>
<v Speaker 3>destroy the system because it'll keep </v>

1202
01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:52.820
<v Speaker 3>amplifying upward until the speakers </v>
<v Speaker 3>blow,</v>

1203
01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:53.953
<v Speaker 3>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a positive feedback loop and a </v>

1204
01:00:55.911 --> 01:00:59.900
<v Speaker 3>positive feedback loop can spiral you </v>
<v Speaker 3>upward or it can spiral you downward.</v>

1205
01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:01.153
<v Speaker 3>And so a virtuous circle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a virtuous positive feedback loop is </v>

1206
01:01:05.151 --> 01:01:05.571
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1207
01:01:05.571 --> 01:01:06.404
<v Speaker 3>I've traded with him and I've traded </v>
<v Speaker 3>with him and I've traded with him and </v>

1208
01:01:08.931 --> 01:01:09.764
<v Speaker 3>now I can say to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've traded with these three people and </v>

1209
01:01:12.081 --> 01:01:14.630
<v Speaker 3>you go talk to them when they say good </v>
<v Speaker 3>things and so then you say,</v>

1210
01:01:14.631 --> 01:01:15.620
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll trade with you.</v>

1211
01:01:15.621 --> 01:01:16.454
<v Speaker 3>And then because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you're even more likely to trade </v>

1212
01:01:18.351 --> 01:01:20.810
<v Speaker 3>with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like the thing starts to spiral</v>

1213
01:01:20.811 --> 01:01:23.930
<v Speaker 3>uphill and it does that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think in a nonlinear form.</v>

1214
01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:25.333
<v Speaker 3>And so because one of the things you </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys are going to be asking yourself as </v>

1215
01:01:27.651 --> 01:01:28.484
<v Speaker 3>you mature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because what's happening is that income </v>

1216
01:01:30.711 --> 01:01:32.480
<v Speaker 3>inequality is increasing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1217
01:01:32.481 --> 01:01:33.650
<v Speaker 3>And you might ask,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well why that?</v>

1218
01:01:33.651 --> 01:01:35.990
<v Speaker 3>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first thing you need to know is that</v>

1219
01:01:36.110 --> 01:01:40.430
<v Speaker 3>that's what income does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's not like you need an explanation</v>

1220
01:01:40.431 --> 01:01:40.800
<v Speaker 3>for it.</v>

1221
01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:43.370
<v Speaker 3>This is the explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a natural rule.</v>

1222
01:01:43.550 --> 01:01:46.880
<v Speaker 3>If you run a trading game to its logical</v>
<v Speaker 3>conclusion,</v>

1223
01:01:46.881 --> 01:01:50.570
<v Speaker 3>one person ends up with all the money </v>
<v Speaker 3>and everyone else ends up with zero,</v>

1224
01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:53.630
<v Speaker 3>so you don't need an explanation for </v>
<v Speaker 3>that because that's,</v>

1225
01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:57.530
<v Speaker 3>that's it's in the natural order of </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that that occurs,</v>

1226
01:01:57.560 --> 01:01:58.393
<v Speaker 3>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a logical consequence of a random </v>

1227
01:02:00.501 --> 01:02:02.840
<v Speaker 3>trading game with zero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As one of the polls,</v>

1228
01:02:03.650 --> 01:02:05.030
<v Speaker 3>you still might ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1229
01:02:05.031 --> 01:02:05.864
<v Speaker 3>what can you do about income inequality?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's a perfectly reasonable </v>

1230
01:02:08.421 --> 01:02:10.250
<v Speaker 3>question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as I said already,</v>

1231
01:02:10.251 --> 01:02:11.084
<v Speaker 3>the answer to that is what's if it's an </v>
<v Speaker 3>extraordinarily complicated problem to </v>

1232
01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:16.730
<v Speaker 3>to address,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't really know how to address it.</v>

1233
01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:20.580
<v Speaker 3>The only time it's really been </v>
<v Speaker 3>successfully as far as I can tell,</v>

1234
01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:24.060
<v Speaker 3>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is during the industrial revolution,</v>

1235
01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:27.120
<v Speaker 3>especially in the part of the industrial</v>
<v Speaker 3>revolution that occurred,</v>

1236
01:02:27.121 --> 01:02:31.560
<v Speaker 3>say after World War II in the developing</v>
<v Speaker 3>world where for one reason or another,</v>

1237
01:02:31.830 --> 01:02:32.663
<v Speaker 3>it turned out that there were a </v>
<v Speaker 3>tremendous number of high paying </v>

1238
01:02:34.950 --> 01:02:35.783
<v Speaker 3>industrial jobs that people who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that people could get access to without </v>

1239
01:02:40.201 --> 01:02:41.034
<v Speaker 3>having had the fortune,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the good fortune of one of these </v>

1240
01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:45.030
<v Speaker 3>positive feedback loops working for </v>
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

1241
01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:47.820
<v Speaker 3>but those jobs are disappearing very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

1242
01:02:47.821 --> 01:02:50.580
<v Speaker 3>very rapidly and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and one of the problems is,</v>

1243
01:02:50.581 --> 01:02:51.414
<v Speaker 3>as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that computational devices are in </v>

1244
01:02:54.451 --> 01:02:57.030
<v Speaker 3>intelligence and conscientiousness </v>
<v Speaker 3>multiplier.</v>

1245
01:02:57.510 --> 01:02:58.343
<v Speaker 3>And that's a big problem because the </v>
<v Speaker 3>more intelligent people are already and </v>

1246
01:03:00.721 --> 01:03:04.410
<v Speaker 3>more conscientious people are already </v>
<v Speaker 3>more likely to be tapped up on the,</v>

1247
01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:07.950
<v Speaker 3>on the winner's side of the prieto </v>
<v Speaker 3>distribution.</v>

1248
01:03:07.951 --> 01:03:08.890
<v Speaker 3>Then you add,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1249
01:03:08.990 --> 01:03:12.630
<v Speaker 3>if you have an Iq of 150,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say you have an Iq of 150,</v>

1250
01:03:12.631 --> 01:03:14.790
<v Speaker 3>you know how to use a computer and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>live in Silicon Valley.</v>

1251
01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:17.010
<v Speaker 3>So man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a deadly person,</v>

1252
01:03:17.011 --> 01:03:18.330
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you're super fast,</v>

1253
01:03:18.331 --> 01:03:19.164
<v Speaker 3>let's say you're super hard working.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We could also say maybe you're super </v>

1254
01:03:21.421 --> 01:03:22.254
<v Speaker 3>energetic and healthy because that also </v>
<v Speaker 3>seems to be a criteria and that is a </v>

1255
01:03:25.231 --> 01:03:28.680
<v Speaker 3>real important determinant of that kind </v>
<v Speaker 3>of lifetime hyper success.</v>

1256
01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:31.860
<v Speaker 3>So you need you're way the hell above </v>
<v Speaker 3>average in ICU.</v>

1257
01:03:31.861 --> 01:03:33.330
<v Speaker 3>You're very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very industrious.</v>

1258
01:03:33.930 --> 01:03:36.000
<v Speaker 3>You know how to use computers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are massive,</v>

1259
01:03:36.001 --> 01:03:39.960
<v Speaker 3>insanely massive effort multiplier and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then you're surrounded by people who are</v>

1260
01:03:39.961 --> 01:03:40.794
<v Speaker 3>super smart.</v>

1261
01:03:41.180 --> 01:03:42.810
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's a lot of things going </v>
<v Speaker 3>for you,</v>

1262
01:03:43.140 --> 01:03:43.973
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to be moving ahead at an </v>

1263
01:03:44.970 --> 01:03:46.290
<v Speaker 3>awful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>awful rate.</v>

1264
01:03:46.470 --> 01:03:47.303
<v Speaker 3>That's again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why places like Silicon Valley are so </v>

1265
01:03:49.051 --> 01:03:49.884
<v Speaker 3>damn effective is that they're bringing </v>
<v Speaker 3>people from all over the world who are </v>

1266
01:03:52.861 --> 01:03:55.650
<v Speaker 3>like that into one place like silicon </v>
<v Speaker 3>valley.</v>

1267
01:03:55.830 --> 01:03:58.470
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you guys know about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Indian Institute of Technology,</v>

1268
01:03:58.471 --> 01:03:59.304
<v Speaker 3>but it's India's answered to mit and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's one hell of an engineering school </v>

1269
01:04:02.430 --> 01:04:06.120
<v Speaker 3>and but a huge number of the graduates </v>
<v Speaker 3>from India go to Silicon Valley and work</v>

1270
01:04:06.121 --> 01:04:09.630
<v Speaker 3>there mostly as entrepreneurs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're very good at being entrepreneurs</v>

1271
01:04:09.631 --> 01:04:10.464
<v Speaker 3>as it turns out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they ship money like mad back to </v>

1272
01:04:12.301 --> 01:04:14.520
<v Speaker 3>India and that's part of what's driving </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Indian economy.</v>

1273
01:04:14.521 --> 01:04:15.354
<v Speaker 3>But it's just another example is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>because silicon valley is already full </v>

1274
01:04:18.631 --> 01:04:19.464
<v Speaker 3>of brilliant entrepreneurial people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then more brilliant and entrepreneurial </v>

1275
01:04:22.681 --> 01:04:25.740
<v Speaker 3>people from all over the world flock </v>
<v Speaker 3>there like mad and it's just,</v>

1276
01:04:26.610 --> 01:04:30.150
<v Speaker 3>it's one of these cycles that spirals </v>
<v Speaker 3>upward,</v>

1277
01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:31.620
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very difficult to,</v>

1278
01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:35.190
<v Speaker 3>to set that up somewhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And once it gets going,</v>

1279
01:04:35.191 --> 01:04:38.670
<v Speaker 3>it's an unbelievably powerful economic </v>
<v Speaker 3>engine crazily,</v>

1280
01:04:38.671 --> 01:04:40.620
<v Speaker 3>crazily powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1281
01:04:43.170 --> 01:04:44.003
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

1282
01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:48.510
<v Speaker 3>so what's the panoply let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of of predictors that we know of?</v>

1283
01:04:48.930 --> 01:04:50.310
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1284
01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:54.270
<v Speaker 3>and so these are determinants of </v>
<v Speaker 3>lifetime success as far as I can tell.</v>

1285
01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:55.613
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I would think about this because </v>

1286
01:04:57.750 --> 01:05:00.960
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you what it is that you need </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do to be successful.</v>

1287
01:05:00.961 --> 01:05:03.240
<v Speaker 3>Some of these things aren't so </v>
<v Speaker 3>malleable,</v>

1288
01:05:03.241 --> 01:05:05.100
<v Speaker 3>but others are things that you can work </v>
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

1289
01:05:05.340 --> 01:05:06.240
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Iq.</v>

1290
01:05:06.390 --> 01:05:07.223
<v Speaker 3>Well that's a rough one because there is</v>
<v Speaker 3>no evidence as far as I can tell that </v>

1291
01:05:11.371 --> 01:05:12.204
<v Speaker 3>you can do a damn thing about your Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just reading a paper by Dan Simon </v>

1292
01:05:15.481 --> 01:05:16.410
<v Speaker 3>today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1293
01:05:16.411 --> 01:05:17.244
<v Speaker 3>it's a relatively recent review.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dan Simon did the invisible gorilla </v>

1294
01:05:19.511 --> 01:05:20.344
<v Speaker 3>stuff and he was looking because there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these companies that claim that </v>

1295
01:05:22.541 --> 01:05:26.350
<v Speaker 3>these online brain training exercises </v>
<v Speaker 3>can produce cognitive improvements,</v>

1296
01:05:26.351 --> 01:05:27.790
<v Speaker 3>and he reviewed the literature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gannon,</v>

1297
01:05:27.970 --> 01:05:28.803
<v Speaker 3>I reviewed that literature like six </v>
<v Speaker 3>times in the last 15 years because I </v>

1298
01:05:31.361 --> 01:05:33.070
<v Speaker 3>keep hoping that someone will crack the </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem,</v>

1299
01:05:33.071 --> 01:05:34.420
<v Speaker 3>but it's always the same answer.</v>

1300
01:05:34.420 --> 01:05:35.253
<v Speaker 3>It's like you do brain training games.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get better at the game a lot better </v>

1301
01:05:38.891 --> 01:05:39.724
<v Speaker 3>at that game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get slightly better at similar </v>

1302
01:05:41.621 --> 01:05:42.454
<v Speaker 3>games,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but distal games that are still heavily </v>

1303
01:05:44.171 --> 01:05:47.920
<v Speaker 3>cognitively loaded doesn't affect your </v>
<v Speaker 3>performance at all.</v>

1304
01:05:47.980 --> 01:05:49.270
<v Speaker 3>Zero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>None.</v>

1305
01:05:49.870 --> 01:05:50.990
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1306
01:05:51.060 --> 01:05:52.870
<v Speaker 3>the issue of how to raise Iq,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1307
01:05:52.871 --> 01:05:54.110
<v Speaker 3>that's a killer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one knows what,</v>

1308
01:05:54.111 --> 01:05:54.944
<v Speaker 3>how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can tell you how to stop your Iq from </v>

1309
01:05:57.011 --> 01:06:00.820
<v Speaker 3>decreasing as you get older.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not so bad because it does that.</v>

1310
01:06:01.090 --> 01:06:04.350
<v Speaker 3>A fluid Iq decreases from the time </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're 20 and,</v>

1311
01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:06.730
<v Speaker 3>and pretty rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a physical.</v>

1312
01:06:06.731 --> 01:06:09.370
<v Speaker 3>Health is the best preventative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So exercise,</v>

1313
01:06:09.610 --> 01:06:11.800
<v Speaker 3>physical exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>weirdly enough,</v>

1314
01:06:11.870 --> 01:06:12.703
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think,</v>

1315
01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:13.570
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>

1316
01:06:13.570 --> 01:06:14.403
<v Speaker 3>While your brain uses oxygen like Matt </v>
<v Speaker 3>right handed and it and it needs to be </v>

1317
01:06:17.771 --> 01:06:21.400
<v Speaker 3>kept clean and well oxygenated and </v>
<v Speaker 3>physical exercise,</v>

1318
01:06:21.401 --> 01:06:25.570
<v Speaker 3>both both like weightlifting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so anaerobic and aerobic,</v>

1319
01:06:26.740 --> 01:06:31.180
<v Speaker 3>anaerobic and aerobic exercise both seem</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be very,</v>

1320
01:06:31.181 --> 01:06:36.070
<v Speaker 3>very effective at staving off cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 3>declines across the lifespan.</v>

1321
01:06:36.370 --> 01:06:37.203
<v Speaker 3>So that's a really useful thing to know </v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's the only thing we know </v>

1322
01:06:40.061 --> 01:06:40.894
<v Speaker 3>that does that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then the next best predictor of </v>

1323
01:06:43.631 --> 01:06:44.464
<v Speaker 3>lifetime success is conscientiousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>While so and of the of the two aspects </v>

1324
01:06:48.731 --> 01:06:52.540
<v Speaker 3>of conscientiousness say orderliness and</v>
<v Speaker 3>industriousness,</v>

1325
01:06:52.660 --> 01:06:55.330
<v Speaker 3>the better predictor is industriousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the question is,</v>

1326
01:06:55.331 --> 01:06:56.164
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what can you do about your </v>

1327
01:06:56.681 --> 01:06:58.750
<v Speaker 3>industriousness?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the answer to that is,</v>

1328
01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:02.950
<v Speaker 3>well that's Kinda rough too because </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a strong genetic component,</v>

1329
01:07:03.310 --> 01:07:04.143
<v Speaker 3>but you can work on micro habits with </v>
<v Speaker 3>regards to your conscientiousness and I </v>

1330
01:07:08.651 --> 01:07:09.484
<v Speaker 3>think the best micro habits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is partly to do with this future </v>

1331
01:07:12.221 --> 01:07:13.054
<v Speaker 3>authoring program processes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the best thing you can do with </v>

1332
01:07:14.861 --> 01:07:18.760
<v Speaker 3>regards to your conscientiousness is to </v>
<v Speaker 3>set up some aims for yourself.</v>

1333
01:07:18.850 --> 01:07:23.440
<v Speaker 3>Goals that you actually value and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>future authoring program helps people do</v>

1334
01:07:23.441 --> 01:07:24.274
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And basically it does a situational </v>

1335
01:07:26.441 --> 01:07:27.274
<v Speaker 3>analysis of it helps you do a </v>
<v Speaker 3>situational analysis of your life more </v>

1336
01:07:30.701 --> 01:07:32.710
<v Speaker 3>than a psychological analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say.</v>

1337
01:07:32.710 --> 01:07:34.900
<v Speaker 3>And so the questions are something like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1338
01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:36.333
<v Speaker 3>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have to put some effort </v>

1339
01:07:37.001 --> 01:07:40.600
<v Speaker 3>into your life and you need to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>motivated to do that.</v>

1340
01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:43.480
<v Speaker 3>And so what are the potential sources of</v>
<v Speaker 3>motivation?</v>

1341
01:07:43.750 --> 01:07:46.830
<v Speaker 3>You could think about them in the big </v>
<v Speaker 3>five manner.</v>

1342
01:07:47.090 --> 01:07:48.520
<v Speaker 3>If you're extroverted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want friends,</v>

1343
01:07:48.521 --> 01:07:50.530
<v Speaker 3>if you're agreeable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want an intimate relationship.</v>

1344
01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:53.200
<v Speaker 3>If you're disagreeable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to win competitions.</v>

1345
01:07:53.201 --> 01:07:56.530
<v Speaker 3>If you're open,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to engage in creative activity.</v>

1346
01:07:56.770 --> 01:07:58.870
<v Speaker 3>If you're high in neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want security.</v>

1347
01:07:58.900 --> 01:07:59.733
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So those are all sources of potential </v>

1348
01:08:00.851 --> 01:08:03.940
<v Speaker 3>motivation that you could draw on that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you could tailor to your own,</v>

1349
01:08:04.250 --> 01:08:05.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your own personality.</v>

1350
01:08:05.830 --> 01:08:08.770
<v Speaker 3>But then there are dimensions that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to consider your life across.</v>

1351
01:08:08.771 --> 01:08:10.990
<v Speaker 3>And so we asked people about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1352
01:08:11.170 --> 01:08:12.003
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you could have your life the way you </v>

1353
01:08:12.611 --> 01:08:13.444
<v Speaker 3>wanted it in three to five years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you were taking care of yourself </v>

1354
01:08:15.441 --> 01:08:16.274
<v Speaker 3>properly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would you want from your </v>

1355
01:08:17.871 --> 01:08:18.470
<v Speaker 3>friendships?</v>

1356
01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:20.360
<v Speaker 3>What would you want from your intimate </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship?</v>

1357
01:08:20.390 --> 01:08:22.010
<v Speaker 3>How would you like to structure your </v>
<v Speaker 3>family?</v>

1358
01:08:22.220 --> 01:08:24.000
<v Speaker 3>What do you want for your career?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1359
01:08:24.010 --> 01:08:24.843
<v Speaker 3>how are you going to use your time </v>
<v Speaker 3>outside of your job and how are you </v>

1360
01:08:27.561 --> 01:08:29.330
<v Speaker 3>going to regulate your mental,</v>
<v Speaker 3>physical,</v>

1361
01:08:29.390 --> 01:08:30.223
<v Speaker 3>mental,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and physical health and maybe also your </v>

1362
01:08:31.551 --> 01:08:32.384
<v Speaker 3>drug and alcohol use because that's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>good place to auger down because </v>

1363
01:08:35.210 --> 01:08:38.690
<v Speaker 3>alcoholism for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wipes out five to 10 percent of people,</v>

1364
01:08:38.691 --> 01:08:43.691
<v Speaker 3>so you want to keep that under control </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then and then so maybe you know,</v>

1365
01:08:44.650 --> 01:08:47.120
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you develop a vision of what your life,</v>

1366
01:08:47.180 --> 01:08:51.500
<v Speaker 3>what you would like your life to be and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that associates the.</v>

1367
01:08:52.070 --> 01:08:52.903
<v Speaker 3>So the goal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once the goal is established and then </v>

1368
01:08:54.471 --> 01:08:58.160
<v Speaker 3>you break down the goal into micro </v>
<v Speaker 3>processes that you can implement,</v>

1369
01:08:58.520 --> 01:08:59.353
<v Speaker 3>the microprocesses become rewarding in </v>
<v Speaker 3>proportion in relation to their causal </v>

1370
01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.990
<v Speaker 3>association with the goal and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>tangles in your,</v>

1371
01:09:08.350 --> 01:09:09.740
<v Speaker 3>your incentive reward system.</v>

1372
01:09:09.740 --> 01:09:10.573
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we talked about the dopaminergic </v>

1373
01:09:11.391 --> 01:09:12.224
<v Speaker 3>incentive reward system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's the thing that keeps you </v>

1374
01:09:13.581 --> 01:09:14.414
<v Speaker 3>moving forward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the way it works is that it works </v>

1375
01:09:16.251 --> 01:09:17.084
<v Speaker 3>better if it produces positive emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When it can see you moving towards a </v>

1376
01:09:21.621 --> 01:09:23.090
<v Speaker 3>valued goal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1377
01:09:23.091 --> 01:09:23.924
<v Speaker 3>well what's the implication of that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Better have a valued goal because </v>

1378
01:09:27.081 --> 01:09:30.080
<v Speaker 3>otherwise you can't get any positive </v>
<v Speaker 3>motivation working out.</v>

1379
01:09:30.081 --> 01:09:32.660
<v Speaker 3>And so the more valuable the goal in </v>
<v Speaker 3>principle,</v>

1380
01:09:32.661 --> 01:09:33.494
<v Speaker 3>the more the microprocessor is </v>
<v Speaker 3>associated with that goal start to take </v>

1381
01:09:36.591 --> 01:09:37.424
<v Speaker 3>on a positive charge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so what that means is while you get </v>

1382
01:09:39.831 --> 01:09:41.760
<v Speaker 3>up in the morning and you're excited </v>
<v Speaker 3>about today,</v>

1383
01:09:41.830 --> 01:09:44.150
<v Speaker 3>you're ready to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so as far as I can tell,</v>

1384
01:09:44.151 --> 01:09:47.540
<v Speaker 3>what you do is you specify your longterm</v>
<v Speaker 3>ideal.</v>

1385
01:09:48.230 --> 01:09:49.063
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you also specify a place you want </v>
<v Speaker 3>to stay the hell away from so that </v>

1386
01:09:51.381 --> 01:09:52.214
<v Speaker 3>you're terrified to fail as well as </v>
<v Speaker 3>excited about succeeding because that's </v>

1387
01:09:55.341 --> 01:09:56.180
<v Speaker 3>also useful.</v>

1388
01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:59.060
<v Speaker 3>You specify your goal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You do that.</v>

1389
01:09:59.260 --> 01:10:02.210
<v Speaker 3>You do that in some sense as a unique </v>
<v Speaker 3>individual.</v>

1390
01:10:02.211 --> 01:10:03.044
<v Speaker 3>You want to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to specify goals that make you </v>

1391
01:10:04.551 --> 01:10:05.570
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1392
01:10:05.810 --> 01:10:08.450
<v Speaker 3>if that could happen as a consequence of</v>
<v Speaker 3>my efforts,</v>

1393
01:10:08.451 --> 01:10:11.990
<v Speaker 3>it would clearly be worthwhile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because the question always is,</v>

1394
01:10:11.991 --> 01:10:14.540
<v Speaker 3>why do something?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because doing nothing is easy.</v>

1395
01:10:14.541 --> 01:10:16.880
<v Speaker 3>You just sit there and you don't do </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything that's real easy.</v>

1396
01:10:17.150 --> 01:10:19.070
<v Speaker 3>The question is why would you ever do </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything?</v>

1397
01:10:19.580 --> 01:10:20.413
<v Speaker 3>And the answer that has to be because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you've determined by some means that </v>

1398
01:10:23.481 --> 01:10:26.180
<v Speaker 3>it's worthwhile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the next question might be,</v>

1399
01:10:26.181 --> 01:10:27.014
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where should you look for worthwhile </v>

1400
01:10:27.981 --> 01:10:29.300
<v Speaker 3>things and one would be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1401
01:10:29.301 --> 01:10:30.134
<v Speaker 3>you could consult your own temperament </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the other would be while you kinda </v>

1402
01:10:33.110 --> 01:10:33.943
<v Speaker 3>look at how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at what it is that people accrue </v>

1403
01:10:36.860 --> 01:10:39.470
<v Speaker 3>that's valuable across the lifespan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

1404
01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:40.333
<v Speaker 3>look what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you do a structural analysis of the </v>

1405
01:10:42.741 --> 01:10:45.770
<v Speaker 3>subcomponents of human existence and </v>
<v Speaker 3>already did that.</v>

1406
01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:48.020
<v Speaker 3>You need a family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need friends,</v>

1407
01:10:48.050 --> 01:10:49.490
<v Speaker 3>like you don't need to have all of these</v>
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

1408
01:10:49.491 --> 01:10:51.530
<v Speaker 3>but you better have most of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Family,</v>

1409
01:10:51.531 --> 01:10:52.490
<v Speaker 3>friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>career,</v>

1410
01:10:52.670 --> 01:10:56.600
<v Speaker 3>educational goals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>plans for time outside of work,</v>

1411
01:10:57.340 --> 01:10:59.390
<v Speaker 3>attention to your mental and physical </v>
<v Speaker 3>health,</v>

1412
01:10:59.391 --> 01:11:01.910
<v Speaker 3>etc. You know those are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what life is about.</v>

1413
01:11:01.911 --> 01:11:04.610
<v Speaker 3>And if You don't have any of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

1414
01:11:04.611 --> 01:11:07.190
<v Speaker 3>well then all you've got left is misery </v>
<v Speaker 3>and suffering.</v>

1415
01:11:07.191 --> 01:11:11.060
<v Speaker 3>So that's a bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a bad deal for you.</v>

1416
01:11:12.050 --> 01:11:14.310
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so once you bought,</v>

1417
01:11:14.311 --> 01:11:16.980
<v Speaker 3>once you set up that goal structure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

1418
01:11:16.981 --> 01:11:17.814
<v Speaker 3>and that's really in many in many ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what you should be doing at </v>

1419
01:11:20.581 --> 01:11:21.414
<v Speaker 3>universities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly what you should be doing </v>

1420
01:11:23.011 --> 01:11:26.700
<v Speaker 3>is trying to figure out who it is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to be,</v>

1421
01:11:27.690 --> 01:11:28.523
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the aim at that and then use </v>

1422
01:11:30.781 --> 01:11:31.614
<v Speaker 3>everything you learned as a means of </v>
<v Speaker 3>building that person that you want to </v>

1423
01:11:34.561 --> 01:11:34.830
<v Speaker 3>be.</v>

1424
01:11:34.830 --> 01:11:35.663
<v Speaker 3>And and I really mean want to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't mean should be even those </v>

1425
01:11:38.791 --> 01:11:39.624
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those things are going to overlap and </v>

1426
01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:44.100
<v Speaker 3>it's important to distinguish between </v>
<v Speaker 3>those because that's partly,</v>

1427
01:11:44.101 --> 01:11:46.290
<v Speaker 3>and this is back down to the micro </v>
<v Speaker 3>routine analysis.</v>

1428
01:11:46.291 --> 01:11:47.041
<v Speaker 3>So I started saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1429
01:11:47.041 --> 01:11:48.750
<v Speaker 3>you're going to try to make yourself </v>
<v Speaker 3>more industrious.</v>

1430
01:11:48.930 --> 01:11:49.711
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Number one,</v>

1431
01:11:49.711 --> 01:11:50.544
<v Speaker 3>specify your damn goals because how are </v>
<v Speaker 3>you going to hit something if you don't </v>

1432
01:11:52.891 --> 01:11:54.810
<v Speaker 3>know what it is that isn't going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>

1433
01:11:55.110 --> 01:11:55.943
<v Speaker 3>And often people won't specify their </v>
<v Speaker 3>goals too because they don't like to </v>

1434
01:11:58.051 --> 01:11:58.884
<v Speaker 3>specify conditions for failure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you keep yourself all vague and </v>

1435
01:12:01.591 --> 01:12:04.200
<v Speaker 3>foggy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is real easy because that's just a</v>

1436
01:12:04.201 --> 01:12:05.034
<v Speaker 3>matter of not doing as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you don't know when you fail and </v>

1437
01:12:07.981 --> 01:12:08.701
<v Speaker 3>people might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1438
01:12:08.701 --> 01:12:11.210
<v Speaker 3>I really don't want to know when I fail </v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's painful,</v>

1439
01:12:11.290 --> 01:12:14.070
<v Speaker 3>so I'll keep myself blind about when I </v>
<v Speaker 3>fail.</v>

1440
01:12:14.310 --> 01:12:16.200
<v Speaker 3>ThAt's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>except you'll fail all the time.</v>

1441
01:12:16.201 --> 01:12:20.070
<v Speaker 3>Then you just won't know it until you </v>
<v Speaker 3>failed so badly that you're done.</v>

1442
01:12:20.490 --> 01:12:22.710
<v Speaker 3>And that can easily happen by the time </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're 40.</v>

1443
01:12:23.490 --> 01:12:24.323
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I would recommend that you don't let </v>

1444
01:12:26.251 --> 01:12:28.290
<v Speaker 3>that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's willful blindness,</v>

1445
01:12:28.291 --> 01:12:29.580
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could have known,</v>

1446
01:12:29.910 --> 01:12:31.590
<v Speaker 3>but you chose not to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1447
01:12:31.591 --> 01:12:33.540
<v Speaker 3>So once you get your goal structure set </v>
<v Speaker 3>up,</v>

1448
01:12:33.541 --> 01:12:34.111
<v Speaker 3>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1449
01:12:34.111 --> 01:12:34.944
<v Speaker 3>if I could have this life looks like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that might be worth living despite the </v>

1450
01:12:38.071 --> 01:12:39.720
<v Speaker 3>fact that it's going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1451
01:12:40.020 --> 01:12:40.853
<v Speaker 3>anxiety provoking and threatening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's gonna be some suffering and </v>

1452
01:12:42.751 --> 01:12:43.584
<v Speaker 3>loss involved and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously the goal is to have a vision </v>

1453
01:12:47.371 --> 01:12:52.371
<v Speaker 3>for your life such that all things </v>
<v Speaker 3>considered that justifies your effort.</v>

1454
01:12:53.220 --> 01:12:54.840
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then what do you do?</v>

1455
01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:58.270
<v Speaker 3>Well then then you turned down to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>micro routines.</v>

1456
01:12:58.271 --> 01:12:58.711
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1457
01:12:58.711 --> 01:12:59.850
<v Speaker 3>well this is what I'm aiming for.</v>

1458
01:13:00.030 --> 01:13:03.120
<v Speaker 3>How does that instantiate itself day to </v>
<v Speaker 3>day,</v>

1459
01:13:03.121 --> 01:13:04.470
<v Speaker 3>week to week,</v>
<v Speaker 3>month to month,</v>

1460
01:13:04.770 --> 01:13:07.920
<v Speaker 3>and that's where something like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>schedule can be unbelievably useful.</v>

1461
01:13:07.950 --> 01:13:11.430
<v Speaker 3>google calendar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like make a damn schedule and stick</v>

1462
01:13:11.431 --> 01:13:12.450
<v Speaker 3>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1463
01:13:12.451 --> 01:13:15.720
<v Speaker 3>so what's the rule with the schedule?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a bloody prison.</v>

1464
01:13:16.620 --> 01:13:18.180
<v Speaker 3>That's the first thing that people do </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong.</v>

1465
01:13:18.181 --> 01:13:18.451
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1466
01:13:18.451 --> 01:13:20.910
<v Speaker 3>I don't like to follow a schedule.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>

1467
01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:21.833
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what kind of schedule are you setting </v>

1468
01:13:22.591 --> 01:13:23.424
<v Speaker 3>up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I,</v>

1469
01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:25.350
<v Speaker 3>I have to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I have to do this,</v>

1470
01:13:25.351 --> 01:13:26.870
<v Speaker 3>then I have to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1471
01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:29.790
<v Speaker 3>And then I just go play video games </v>
<v Speaker 3>because who wants to do all these things</v>

1472
01:13:29.791 --> 01:13:31.710
<v Speaker 3>that I have to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like wrong.</v>

1473
01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:35.940
<v Speaker 3>Set the damn schedule up so that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have the day you want.</v>

1474
01:13:36.420 --> 01:13:37.680
<v Speaker 3>That's the trick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1475
01:13:37.681 --> 01:13:38.850
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got tomorrow.</v>

1476
01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:39.893
<v Speaker 3>If I was going to set it up so it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>the best possible day I could have </v>

1477
01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:46.650
<v Speaker 3>practically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would it look like?</v>

1478
01:13:47.190 --> 01:13:48.023
<v Speaker 3>Well then you schedule that and </v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously there's a bit of </v>

1479
01:13:49.651 --> 01:13:53.040
<v Speaker 3>responsibility that's going to go along </v>
<v Speaker 3>with that because if you have any sense,</v>

1480
01:13:53.310 --> 01:13:54.143
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>insist upon is that at the end of the </v>

1481
01:13:56.850 --> 01:13:57.683
<v Speaker 3>day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not in worse shape than you were </v>

1482
01:13:59.190 --> 01:14:00.990
<v Speaker 3>then at the beginning of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1483
01:14:01.050 --> 01:14:04.350
<v Speaker 3>Because that's a stupid day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you have a bunch of thoSe in a row,</v>

1484
01:14:04.351 --> 01:14:06.330
<v Speaker 3>you just dig,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dig yourself a hole,</v>

1485
01:14:06.331 --> 01:14:08.040
<v Speaker 3>and then you bury yourself in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1486
01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:10.200
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just not a good strategy.</v>

1487
01:14:10.530 --> 01:14:11.363
<v Speaker 3>It's a bad strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So maybe Twenty percent of your day has </v>

1488
01:14:14.411 --> 01:14:17.350
<v Speaker 3>to be responsibility and obligation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or maybe it's more than that,</v>

1489
01:14:17.351 --> 01:14:20.200
<v Speaker 3>depending on how far behind you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but even that you can.</v>

1490
01:14:20.290 --> 01:14:21.640
<v Speaker 3>You can ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1491
01:14:21.641 --> 01:14:25.510
<v Speaker 3>well I've got these responsibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to schedule the damn things in.</v>

1492
01:14:25.990 --> 01:14:29.080
<v Speaker 3>What's the right ratio of responsibility</v>
<v Speaker 3>to reward?</v>

1493
01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:30.153
<v Speaker 3>And you can ask yourself that just like </v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd negotiate with someone who is </v>

1494
01:14:32.411 --> 01:14:33.040
<v Speaker 3>working for you.</v>

1495
01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:33.551
<v Speaker 3>It'S like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1496
01:14:33.551 --> 01:14:35.350
<v Speaker 3>you gotta work tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1497
01:14:35.351 --> 01:14:37.600
<v Speaker 3>so I want you to work tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you might say,</v>

1498
01:14:37.601 --> 01:14:38.434
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well what are you going to do for me </v>

1499
01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:43.810
<v Speaker 3>that makes it likely that I'll work for </v>
<v Speaker 3>you while you could ask yourself that,</v>

1500
01:14:43.811 --> 01:14:44.644
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe do an hour of of responsibility </v>

1501
01:14:47.531 --> 01:14:49.360
<v Speaker 3>and then you play a video game for 15 </v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes.</v>

1502
01:14:49.361 --> 01:14:51.370
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever turns your crank man,</v>

1503
01:14:51.371 --> 01:14:52.204
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to negotiate with yourself and </v>

1504
01:14:54.491 --> 01:14:55.324
<v Speaker 3>not tyrannized yourself like you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>negotiating with someone that you care </v>

1505
01:14:59.021 --> 01:15:01.990
<v Speaker 3>for that you would like to be productive</v>
<v Speaker 3>and have a good life.</v>

1506
01:15:01.991 --> 01:15:04.380
<v Speaker 3>And that's how you make the schedule.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like.</v>

1507
01:15:04.390 --> 01:15:05.620
<v Speaker 3>And then you look at the day and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>

1508
01:15:05.621 --> 01:15:06.610
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I had that day,</v>

1509
01:15:06.611 --> 01:15:08.500
<v Speaker 3>that'd be good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>

1510
01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:09.550
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you,</v>

1511
01:15:09.550 --> 01:15:10.383
<v Speaker 3>you're useless and horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you'll probably only hit it with </v>

1512
01:15:12.011 --> 01:15:15.730
<v Speaker 3>about 70 percent accuracy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that beats the hell out of zero.</v>

1513
01:15:16.450 --> 01:15:17.283
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you hit it even with 50 percent </v>

1514
01:15:18.701 --> 01:15:20.860
<v Speaker 3>accuracy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another rule is well,</v>

1515
01:15:20.861 --> 01:15:25.630
<v Speaker 3>aim for 51 percent the next week or 50 </v>
<v Speaker 3>and a half percent for god's sake.</v>

1516
01:15:25.631 --> 01:15:30.400
<v Speaker 3>Or because you're gonna hit that </v>
<v Speaker 3>position where things start to loop back</v>

1517
01:15:30.401 --> 01:15:33.580
<v Speaker 3>positively in spiral you upward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1518
01:15:34.270 --> 01:15:37.690
<v Speaker 3>so that's one way that you can work on </v>
<v Speaker 3>your conscientiousness is a plan,</v>

1519
01:15:37.691 --> 01:15:38.524
<v Speaker 3>a life you'd like to have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and and you do that partly by referring </v>

1520
01:15:42.551 --> 01:15:45.550
<v Speaker 3>to social norms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's more or less rescuing your father</v>

1521
01:15:45.551 --> 01:15:46.384
<v Speaker 3>from the belly of the whale,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the other way you do that is by </v>

1522
01:15:48.580 --> 01:15:49.413
<v Speaker 3>having a little conversation with </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself about as if you don't really </v>

1523
01:15:52.571 --> 01:15:54.490
<v Speaker 3>know who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you know what you're like.</v>

1524
01:15:54.491 --> 01:15:55.324
<v Speaker 3>You won't do what you're told.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You won't do what you tell yourself to </v>

1525
01:15:57.581 --> 01:15:59.590
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You must have noticed that.</v>

1526
01:16:00.010 --> 01:16:00.843
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're a bad employee and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>worse boss and both of those work for </v>

1527
01:16:05.381 --> 01:16:06.100
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

1528
01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:06.933
<v Speaker 3>You don't know what you want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when you tell yourself what to </v>

1529
01:16:08.351 --> 01:16:09.400
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't do it anyways.</v>

1530
01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:11.920
<v Speaker 3>You should fire yourself and find </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone else to beat.</v>

1531
01:16:12.260 --> 01:16:13.093
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my point is that you have to </v>

1532
01:16:15.790 --> 01:16:17.950
<v Speaker 3>understand that you're not your own </v>
<v Speaker 3>servant,</v>

1533
01:16:17.951 --> 01:16:18.784
<v Speaker 3>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're someone that you have to </v>

1534
01:16:19.541 --> 01:16:20.374
<v Speaker 3>negotiate with and that's someone that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to present the opportunity of </v>

1535
01:16:25.151 --> 01:16:25.984
<v Speaker 3>having a good life too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's hard for people because they </v>

1536
01:16:27.881 --> 01:16:30.700
<v Speaker 3>don't like themselves very much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you know,</v>

1537
01:16:30.701 --> 01:16:31.534
<v Speaker 3>they're always like cracking the whip </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then procrastinating and cracking </v>

1538
01:16:34.331 --> 01:16:36.130
<v Speaker 3>the whip and then procrastinating and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1539
01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:36.993
<v Speaker 3>god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so boring and such a pathetic way </v>

1540
01:16:39.251 --> 01:16:40.084
<v Speaker 3>of spending your time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know what that's like because </v>

1541
01:16:41.171 --> 01:16:42.004
<v Speaker 3>you probably waste like six hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think we did an economic </v>

1542
01:16:44.621 --> 01:16:46.510
<v Speaker 3>calculation about that a while back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1543
01:16:46.690 --> 01:16:48.580
<v Speaker 3>your time is probably worth 50 bucks an </v>
<v Speaker 3>hour,</v>

1544
01:16:48.790 --> 01:16:50.110
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1545
01:16:50.170 --> 01:16:52.720
<v Speaker 3>you're not getting paid that now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're young.</v>

1546
01:16:52.990 --> 01:16:53.823
<v Speaker 3>And so this is investment time and what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you do now is going to multiply its </v>

1547
01:16:57.341 --> 01:16:58.570
<v Speaker 3>effects in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1548
01:16:58.930 --> 01:17:01.750
<v Speaker 3>so let's say it's 50 bucks an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is perfectly reasonable.</v>

1549
01:17:01.751 --> 01:17:04.060
<v Speaker 3>So if you waste six hours a day and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>

1550
01:17:04.330 --> 01:17:07.870
<v Speaker 3>then you're wasting about $2,000 a week </v>
<v Speaker 3>or about $100,000 a year.</v>

1551
01:17:07.871 --> 01:17:11.120
<v Speaker 3>So like go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it's costing you every hour.</v>

1552
01:17:11.210 --> 01:17:13.310
<v Speaker 3>And you need to know what your damn time</v>
<v Speaker 3>is worth.</v>

1553
01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:15.680
<v Speaker 3>So let's say it's not 50 bucks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's 30,</v>

1554
01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:17.720
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's a hundred,</v>

1555
01:17:17.721 --> 01:17:18.554
<v Speaker 3>it's somewhere in that range.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of The things that you should be </v>

1556
01:17:20.211 --> 01:17:23.180
<v Speaker 3>asking yourself is when you spend an </v>
<v Speaker 3>hour was that,</v>

1557
01:17:23.181 --> 01:17:24.014
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what have I paid someone 50 bucks to </v>

1558
01:17:25.761 --> 01:17:28.250
<v Speaker 3>have had that hour?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if that answer is no,</v>

1559
01:17:28.251 --> 01:17:29.084
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well maybe you should do something else </v>

1560
01:17:30.021 --> 01:17:30.854
<v Speaker 3>with your time.</v>

1561
01:17:31.210 --> 01:17:34.130
<v Speaker 3>And it depends on whether or not you </v>
<v Speaker 3>think that your time is worthwhile.</v>

1562
01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:35.713
<v Speaker 3>But the funny thing about not assuming </v>
<v Speaker 3>that is if you assume your time isn't </v>

1563
01:17:38.241 --> 01:17:39.074
<v Speaker 3>worthwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happens is you don't just sit </v>

1564
01:17:40.821 --> 01:17:44.990
<v Speaker 3>around sort of randomly in a state of </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibility lists bliss.</v>

1565
01:17:45.290 --> 01:17:46.123
<v Speaker 3>What you do is you suffer existentially </v>
<v Speaker 3>and so that seems like a stupid </v>

1566
01:17:50.090 --> 01:17:52.280
<v Speaker 3>solution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So okay.</v>

1567
01:17:52.281 --> 01:17:54.770
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as far as I can tell,</v>

1568
01:17:54.771 --> 01:17:56.780
<v Speaker 3>that's how you can improve your </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscientiousness.</v>

1569
01:17:57.050 --> 01:17:57.883
<v Speaker 3>Hit an outline and goal that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually would like to hit and even </v>

1570
01:18:02.421 --> 01:18:03.254
<v Speaker 3>better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's something else you can think </v>

1571
01:18:04.281 --> 01:18:06.290
<v Speaker 3>about when you're negotiating in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

1572
01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:08.510
<v Speaker 3>You could say if you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>pessimistic,</v>

1573
01:18:08.511 --> 01:18:09.201
<v Speaker 3>you'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1574
01:18:09.201 --> 01:18:11.720
<v Speaker 3>we have to negotiate an agreement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to walk away,</v>

1575
01:18:11.930 --> 01:18:14.780
<v Speaker 3>not miserable and resentful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1576
01:18:14.781 --> 01:18:15.614
<v Speaker 3>let's call that a baseline and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>how you're going to negotiate with your </v>

1577
01:18:17.901 --> 01:18:18.830
<v Speaker 3>wife or your husband.</v>

1578
01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:20.113
<v Speaker 3>That's a good thing to know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to negotiate so that you don't </v>

1579
01:18:22.851 --> 01:18:23.684
<v Speaker 3>walk away miserable and resentful </v>
<v Speaker 3>because that makes you hostile and then </v>

1580
01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:28.033
<v Speaker 3>you'll work to hurt them and I would say</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's unless you want to hurt them and </v>

1581
01:18:31.010 --> 01:18:34.190
<v Speaker 3>then of course they'll happily return </v>
<v Speaker 3>the favor unless you.</v>

1582
01:18:34.250 --> 01:18:35.083
<v Speaker 3>If you want to exist in a place where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're basically hitting each other in </v>

1583
01:18:37.611 --> 01:18:39.890
<v Speaker 3>the head repeatedly for 30 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go right ahead,</v>

1584
01:18:39.891 --> 01:18:42.710
<v Speaker 3>but I wouldn't say that that's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly good way of living.</v>

1585
01:18:43.010 --> 01:18:43.850
<v Speaker 3>So you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1586
01:18:43.851 --> 01:18:47.630
<v Speaker 3>the minimal precondition for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>successful negotiation is that you don't</v>

1587
01:18:47.631 --> 01:18:51.770
<v Speaker 3>walk away resentful and angry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's also how you know when you</v>

1588
01:18:51.771 --> 01:18:55.190
<v Speaker 3>have something to say to someone because</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rule has to be.</v>

1589
01:18:55.490 --> 01:18:57.470
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to walk away resentful </v>
<v Speaker 3>and angry,</v>

1590
01:18:57.800 --> 01:19:00.170
<v Speaker 3>you've got something to say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't mean you're right,</v>

1591
01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:02.690
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it does mean that you have something</v>

1592
01:19:02.691 --> 01:19:05.150
<v Speaker 3>to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's kind of a low bar.</v>

1593
01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:08.000
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if I wanted to live with you for 30</v>

1594
01:19:08.001 --> 01:19:09.050
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe we should say,</v>

1595
01:19:09.051 --> 01:19:11.780
<v Speaker 3>how about we walk away from our mutual </v>
<v Speaker 3>negotiations?</v>

1596
01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:15.350
<v Speaker 3>Thrilled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well why not?</v>

1597
01:19:15.930 --> 01:19:16.763
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to aim for something you could </v>

1598
01:19:18.141 --> 01:19:21.600
<v Speaker 3>aim for that you want to negotiate with </v>
<v Speaker 3>your boss for a new seller.</v>

1599
01:19:21.601 --> 01:19:22.460
<v Speaker 3>You might think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1600
01:19:22.820 --> 01:19:25.610
<v Speaker 3>I've got this damn job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much would I have to be paid,</v>

1601
01:19:25.611 --> 01:19:27.350
<v Speaker 3>so I'd be so bloody excited to go to </v>
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>

1602
01:19:27.351 --> 01:19:31.670
<v Speaker 3>I could hardly stand it while you can at</v>
<v Speaker 3>least know what that number is,</v>

1603
01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:34.040
<v Speaker 3>and then you could go there and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well look,</v>

1604
01:19:34.041 --> 01:19:36.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you like to have me around.</v>

1605
01:19:36.470 --> 01:19:37.303
<v Speaker 3>I've been doing some thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think if you paid me this amount of </v>

1606
01:19:39.501 --> 01:19:40.334
<v Speaker 3>money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be so thrilled to go to work that </v>

1607
01:19:41.451 --> 01:19:43.130
<v Speaker 3>you could hardly even keep me away from </v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

1608
01:19:43.370 --> 01:19:44.750
<v Speaker 3>And your boss might think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

1609
01:19:44.751 --> 01:19:45.584
<v Speaker 3>I actually really liked to have someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>around who would be so thrilled to work </v>

1610
01:19:47.271 --> 01:19:48.410
<v Speaker 3>that I can't get rid of them.</v>

1611
01:19:48.550 --> 01:19:49.730
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe all,</v>

1612
01:19:49.790 --> 01:19:51.360
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't give you all of that.</v>

1613
01:19:51.361 --> 01:19:54.560
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you 75 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we can renegotiate it in a year,</v>

1614
01:19:54.980 --> 01:19:56.000
<v Speaker 3>so like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1615
01:19:56.030 --> 01:20:00.800
<v Speaker 3>good deal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or you can be some weasley coward and go</v>

1616
01:20:00.801 --> 01:20:04.430
<v Speaker 3>in there and snuggle about how awful </v>
<v Speaker 3>your life is and walk away,</v>

1617
01:20:04.580 --> 01:20:07.010
<v Speaker 3>barely able to tolerate the outcome of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>

1618
01:20:08.150 --> 01:20:08.983
<v Speaker 3>So like I wouldn't recommend that and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's funny because I've watched people </v>

1619
01:20:12.571 --> 01:20:15.900
<v Speaker 3>do this repeatedly in my clinical </v>
<v Speaker 3>practice because I do,</v>

1620
01:20:16.710 --> 01:20:19.350
<v Speaker 3>we do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We plan all the time because the rule is</v>

1621
01:20:19.370 --> 01:20:20.203
<v Speaker 3>you're going to come and see me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to try to help you figure out </v>

1622
01:20:21.961 --> 01:20:24.810
<v Speaker 3>how to have the life that you want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have and we're going to think about that</v>

1623
01:20:24.811 --> 01:20:25.644
<v Speaker 3>strategically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're making $50,000 a year right </v>

1624
01:20:27.691 --> 01:20:28.524
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you should be making $150,000 in </v>

1625
01:20:31.381 --> 01:20:32.940
<v Speaker 3>three years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they think,</v>

1626
01:20:32.941 --> 01:20:34.170
<v Speaker 3>well that couldn't happen.</v>

1627
01:20:34.170 --> 01:20:37.950
<v Speaker 3>It's like not with that attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the first thing.</v>

1628
01:20:37.951 --> 01:20:38.580
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1629
01:20:38.580 --> 01:20:39.413
<v Speaker 3>that's not going to happen if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't ask people for the damn </v>

1630
01:20:42.391 --> 01:20:44.130
<v Speaker 3>money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't look for a better job,</v>

1631
01:20:44.131 --> 01:20:47.340
<v Speaker 3>but they're going to come along and just</v>
<v Speaker 3>shovel a boat full of money at you.</v>

1632
01:20:47.341 --> 01:20:47.881
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1633
01:20:47.881 --> 01:20:52.170
<v Speaker 3>that's not going to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but why is that impossible?</v>

1634
01:20:52.890 --> 01:20:55.170
<v Speaker 3>Look at you people in here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1635
01:20:55.171 --> 01:20:57.000
<v Speaker 3>what the hell is wrong with you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing.</v>

1636
01:20:57.980 --> 01:21:01.050
<v Speaker 3>So you probably have what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you could figure out whAt the hell it</v>

1637
01:21:01.051 --> 01:21:03.990
<v Speaker 3>was and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you diligently pursued it.</v>

1638
01:21:04.410 --> 01:21:05.243
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then maybe you wouldn't whIne about </v>

1639
01:21:06.391 --> 01:21:07.224
<v Speaker 3>being alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That'd be good because people who whine </v>

1640
01:21:08.971 --> 01:21:11.910
<v Speaker 3>about being alive or dangerous to </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves and other people.</v>

1641
01:21:12.210 --> 01:21:13.950
<v Speaker 3>So you might think I can have what I </v>
<v Speaker 3>want,</v>

1642
01:21:14.250 --> 01:21:15.083
<v Speaker 3>but you better well figure out what it </v>
<v Speaker 3>is and you can't just wait for the like </v>

1643
01:21:18.300 --> 01:21:19.133
<v Speaker 3>have what you want fairy to show up at </v>
<v Speaker 3>your doorstep and granted because </v>

1644
01:21:21.691 --> 01:21:23.280
<v Speaker 3>obviously that's not going to happen.</v>

1645
01:21:23.820 --> 01:21:25.290
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1646
01:21:25.291 --> 01:21:26.700
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Conscientiousness,</v>

1647
01:21:26.701 --> 01:21:29.310
<v Speaker 3>while we talked about how you could </v>
<v Speaker 3>improve that social networking,</v>

1648
01:21:29.550 --> 01:21:30.383
<v Speaker 3>that's another big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the advantages that older </v>

1649
01:21:31.921 --> 01:21:35.190
<v Speaker 3>people have over younger people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so for example,</v>

1650
01:21:35.250 --> 01:21:37.230
<v Speaker 3>now that I'm in my fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>roughly speaking,</v>

1651
01:21:37.231 --> 01:21:38.064
<v Speaker 3>I know a bunch of other people who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>relatively well positioned in the </v>

1652
01:21:40.681 --> 01:21:43.560
<v Speaker 3>dominance hierarchy and they know all </v>
<v Speaker 3>sorts of people.</v>

1653
01:21:43.950 --> 01:21:47.910
<v Speaker 3>And so when I go to one of them and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can you do x or do you know x?</v>

1654
01:21:47.940 --> 01:21:50.010
<v Speaker 3>They say no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I know someone who can.</v>

1655
01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:51.113
<v Speaker 3>And that's a huge advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So another thing that you want to think </v>

1656
01:21:52.741 --> 01:21:55.380
<v Speaker 3>about as you move through life and this </v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

1657
01:21:55.740 --> 01:21:59.250
<v Speaker 3>is that use your ability to network </v>
<v Speaker 3>properly.</v>

1658
01:21:59.251 --> 01:22:02.310
<v Speaker 3>And that doesn't mean schmooze and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't mean go out and impress people.</v>

1659
01:22:02.311 --> 01:22:05.190
<v Speaker 3>That's all just complete bloody rubbish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It means you,</v>

1660
01:22:05.191 --> 01:22:07.500
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you try to surround yourself with people</v>

1661
01:22:07.501 --> 01:22:08.334
<v Speaker 3>who are competent in multiple different </v>
<v Speaker 3>dimensions and you maintain your </v>

1662
01:22:11.071 --> 01:22:11.970
<v Speaker 3>relationships with them.</v>

1663
01:22:11.970 --> 01:22:13.660
<v Speaker 3>And that's a trading relationship to </v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1664
01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:17.550
<v Speaker 3>It involves from reciprocity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a huge advantage.</v>

1665
01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:18.593
<v Speaker 3>A social network is a huge advantage and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's something extroverted people can </v>

1666
01:22:21.181 --> 01:22:22.014
<v Speaker 3>be really good at because you know they </v>
<v Speaker 3>have that sort of social ability and </v>

1667
01:22:25.261 --> 01:22:26.880
<v Speaker 3>that goes along with the ability to </v>
<v Speaker 3>sell.</v>

1668
01:22:26.881 --> 01:22:30.900
<v Speaker 3>So another place that you can pick up </v>
<v Speaker 3>power and power for the good,</v>

1669
01:22:30.901 --> 01:22:31.734
<v Speaker 3>for the right things is to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is to consciously develop and maintain </v>

1670
01:22:37.051 --> 01:22:39.450
<v Speaker 3>your social networks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that also means,</v>

1671
01:22:39.900 --> 01:22:40.733
<v Speaker 3>while,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's talk about friendships for a </v>

1672
01:22:41.581 --> 01:22:43.230
<v Speaker 3>minute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's how you know,</v>

1673
01:22:43.231 --> 01:22:48.000
<v Speaker 3>if someone's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your friend a you can tell them bad news</v>

1674
01:22:48.660 --> 01:22:49.493
<v Speaker 3>and they'll listen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They won't tell you why you know you're </v>

1675
01:22:51.571 --> 01:22:52.404
<v Speaker 3>stupid and why that bad thing happened </v>
<v Speaker 3>to you and how something worse happened </v>

1676
01:22:55.041 --> 01:22:57.930
<v Speaker 3>to them once and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>derailed the whole conversation.</v>

1677
01:22:58.620 --> 01:23:01.200
<v Speaker 3>You can actually tell them bad news and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll listen.</v>

1678
01:23:01.650 --> 01:23:04.200
<v Speaker 3>So that's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then this is a weirder thing.</v>

1679
01:23:04.500 --> 01:23:09.040
<v Speaker 3>You can tell them good news</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they'll help you celebrate.</v>

1680
01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:12.490
<v Speaker 3>And that's a really good way of deciding</v>
<v Speaker 3>who you should have around you.</v>

1681
01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:15.700
<v Speaker 3>Because if you have someone around you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know some good habits you and you're</v>

1682
01:23:15.701 --> 01:23:18.220
<v Speaker 3>kind of afraid to even admit it because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know god,</v>

1683
01:23:18.221 --> 01:23:19.054
<v Speaker 3>something good happened to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you let that be known and it </v>

1684
01:23:21.271 --> 01:23:23.290
<v Speaker 3>will certainly be taken away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

1685
01:23:23.291 --> 01:23:24.124
<v Speaker 3>you come out and you sort of tell </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone halfheartedly that something </v>

1686
01:23:26.621 --> 01:23:27.454
<v Speaker 3>good happened to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they give you a whack and then talk </v>

1687
01:23:29.141 --> 01:23:30.130
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1688
01:23:30.150 --> 01:23:33.220
<v Speaker 3>so the great thing that happened to them</v>
<v Speaker 3>three years ago or worse,</v>

1689
01:23:33.221 --> 01:23:36.250
<v Speaker 3>the great thing that happened to someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they knew three years ago,</v>

1690
01:23:36.740 --> 01:23:39.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like go away from that person.</v>

1691
01:23:39.131 --> 01:23:42.520
<v Speaker 3>They're not helpful to you and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>not helpful to themselves either.</v>

1692
01:23:42.850 --> 01:23:45.280
<v Speaker 3>And so you want to surround years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got to think about this.</v>

1693
01:23:45.590 --> 01:23:46.423
<v Speaker 3>You've got to surround yourself with </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who want the best for the best </v>

1694
01:23:49.571 --> 01:23:50.404
<v Speaker 3>part of you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can hang around with weasels and </v>

1695
01:23:52.421 --> 01:23:53.254
<v Speaker 3>losers that are trying to pull you down </v>
<v Speaker 3>to justify the fact that they're </v>

1696
01:23:55.631 --> 01:23:57.610
<v Speaker 3>spiraling downhill as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1697
01:23:57.611 --> 01:24:00.580
<v Speaker 3>the upside of that is you don't have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have any responsibility,</v>

1698
01:24:00.670 --> 01:24:02.800
<v Speaker 3>can whine about how wretched life is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1699
01:24:02.801 --> 01:24:03.634
<v Speaker 3>so that's pretty attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I would say it's also a bad medium </v>

1700
01:24:06.551 --> 01:24:08.680
<v Speaker 3>to longterm plan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it's,</v>

1701
01:24:08.860 --> 01:24:09.693
<v Speaker 3>it's acceptable and desirable to try to </v>
<v Speaker 3>surround yourself with people who were </v>

1702
01:24:15.491 --> 01:24:18.370
<v Speaker 3>facilitating your development.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know when you might say,</v>

1703
01:24:18.371 --> 01:24:19.620
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got people around,</v>

1704
01:24:19.630 --> 01:24:21.160
<v Speaker 3>I know them well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know they're,</v>

1705
01:24:21.180 --> 01:24:22.013
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not doing that well and they're </v>

1706
01:24:23.950 --> 01:24:26.230
<v Speaker 3>and they don't fit into that category.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1707
01:24:28.540 --> 01:24:29.373
<v Speaker 3>what's your point?</v>

1708
01:24:29.830 --> 01:24:31.390
<v Speaker 3>What are you going to do with them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1709
01:24:31.630 --> 01:24:33.940
<v Speaker 3>If they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they'll listen and cooperate with you</v>

1710
01:24:34.180 --> 01:24:36.550
<v Speaker 3>and move towards a better future,</v>
<v Speaker 3>great.</v>

1711
01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:40.210
<v Speaker 3>if they don't pay any attention and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>keep doing the same damn things over and</v>

1712
01:24:40.211 --> 01:24:42.430
<v Speaker 3>over and they're not going anywhere and </v>
<v Speaker 3>is painful,</v>

1713
01:24:42.700 --> 01:24:44.950
<v Speaker 3>then maybe the proper thing to do is </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

1714
01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:45.993
<v Speaker 3>you just have your misery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll go off and have my life and maybe </v>

1715
01:24:49.241 --> 01:24:50.074
<v Speaker 3>you'll wake up at some point in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>future and think that's a better way of </v>

1716
01:24:52.361 --> 01:24:56.230
<v Speaker 3>being because just putting up with it is</v>
<v Speaker 3>while they call that enabling,</v>

1717
01:24:56.231 --> 01:24:58.690
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You put up with that sort of behavior.</v>

1718
01:24:58.900 --> 01:25:03.010
<v Speaker 3>You're providing tacit consent for it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and even tacit approval.</v>

1719
01:25:03.370 --> 01:25:05.650
<v Speaker 3>It's like bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have,</v>

1720
01:25:06.490 --> 01:25:10.240
<v Speaker 3>I would say both the right and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibility to surround yourself with</v>

1721
01:25:10.241 --> 01:25:14.980
<v Speaker 3>people who are good for the best part of</v>
<v Speaker 3>you and that's not the same as you know.</v>

1722
01:25:16.950 --> 01:25:19.300
<v Speaker 3>Don't have to elaborate on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can figure out what that means.</v>

1723
01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:21.700
<v Speaker 3>Skills,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's another thing you can do,</v>

1724
01:25:21.701 --> 01:25:22.534
<v Speaker 3>and if you want to increase your </v>
<v Speaker 3>probability of success every time you </v>

1725
01:25:25.211 --> 01:25:26.044
<v Speaker 3>have an opportunity to take an </v>
<v Speaker 3>opportunity that would provide you with </v>

1726
01:25:29.170 --> 01:25:31.300
<v Speaker 3>a new skill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do it right.</v>

1727
01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:33.040
<v Speaker 3>Learn to program,</v>
<v Speaker 3>learn to write,</v>

1728
01:25:33.041 --> 01:25:34.570
<v Speaker 3>learn to read,</v>
<v Speaker 3>read new things,</v>

1729
01:25:34.571 --> 01:25:35.404
<v Speaker 3>learn to public speak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Learn how to introduce yourSelf to </v>

1730
01:25:37.241 --> 01:25:38.890
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Learn how to socIal network,</v>

1731
01:25:39.130 --> 01:25:41.910
<v Speaker 3>learn how to go talk to your boss in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>matter.</v>

1732
01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:44.950
<v Speaker 3>This is the right way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Talk to someone who's supervising you.</v>

1733
01:25:46.060 --> 01:25:46.893
<v Speaker 3>I see this problem and here's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>solution and so I'm coming to talk to </v>

1734
01:25:50.201 --> 01:25:51.034
<v Speaker 3>you about the problem and the solution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like that person is going to want </v>

1735
01:25:53.741 --> 01:25:57.050
<v Speaker 3>to talk to you a lot because the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>people they're talking to,</v>

1736
01:25:57.051 --> 01:25:59.170
<v Speaker 3>you are going to come and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got a problem.</v>

1737
01:25:59.770 --> 01:26:00.603
<v Speaker 3>Can you do something about it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they don't want to do something </v>

1738
01:26:02.141 --> 01:26:04.010
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They already got things to do.</v>

1739
01:26:04.011 --> 01:26:04.844
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you're the person who constantly </v>

1740
01:26:05.961 --> 01:26:09.530
<v Speaker 3>brings forth a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if they're accurate problems,</v>

1741
01:26:09.531 --> 01:26:10.364
<v Speaker 3>is why are they going?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to want to have you </v>

1742
01:26:11.421 --> 01:26:13.160
<v Speaker 3>around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's you're just,</v>

1743
01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:14.593
<v Speaker 3>you're just another problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't be a problem for the people who </v>

1744
01:26:17.241 --> 01:26:19.850
<v Speaker 3>want to give you money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good rule of thumb,</v>

1745
01:26:19.851 --> 01:26:21.020
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1746
01:26:21.140 --> 01:26:24.590
<v Speaker 3>if someone wants to give you money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then help them do that.</v>

1747
01:26:24.830 --> 01:26:26.780
<v Speaker 3>And if they want to give you status and </v>
<v Speaker 3>success,</v>

1748
01:26:26.781 --> 01:26:28.280
<v Speaker 3>then help them do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1749
01:26:28.490 --> 01:26:29.323
<v Speaker 3>And you do that in part by bringing them</v>
<v Speaker 3>solutions and partly you do that by </v>

1750
01:26:31.881 --> 01:26:32.714
<v Speaker 3>developing your skills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so if things aren't going very well </v>

1751
01:26:35.001 --> 01:26:37.430
<v Speaker 3>for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is also a good way of evaluating an</v>

1752
01:26:37.431 --> 01:26:39.980
<v Speaker 3>opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Should you take an opportunity.</v>

1753
01:26:40.250 --> 01:26:41.390
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the rule,</v>

1754
01:26:42.860 --> 01:26:46.370
<v Speaker 3>take the opportunity if it will teach </v>
<v Speaker 3>you something that you can use for other</v>

1755
01:26:46.371 --> 01:26:48.530
<v Speaker 3>opportunities because then even if it </v>
<v Speaker 3>fails,</v>

1756
01:26:49.510 --> 01:26:50.343
<v Speaker 3>which it probably will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't matter because you've accrued </v>

1757
01:26:52.821 --> 01:26:56.750
<v Speaker 3>something of value that you can bring </v>
<v Speaker 3>forward to the next situation.</v>

1758
01:26:56.780 --> 01:26:57.613
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this old union idea that I told </v>

1759
01:26:59.511 --> 01:27:02.600
<v Speaker 3>you about the sharp cathedral,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

1760
01:27:03.830 --> 01:27:07.490
<v Speaker 3>the cathedral is made in the form of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>cross and the cross signifies the center</v>

1761
01:27:07.491 --> 01:27:08.324
<v Speaker 3>of the world and the dome signifies the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sky and so right below the dome at the </v>

1762
01:27:12.141 --> 01:27:12.974
<v Speaker 3>center of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's a cross because the cross is </v>

1763
01:27:15.141 --> 01:27:15.974
<v Speaker 3>the place of suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's the center of the world </v>

1764
01:27:17.450 --> 01:27:19.760
<v Speaker 3>because that's what you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're the place of suffering,</v>

1765
01:27:19.761 --> 01:27:21.410
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're the place of conscious suffering.</v>

1766
01:27:21.470 --> 01:27:22.303
<v Speaker 3>That's the center Of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so inscribed on the floor is a maze </v>

1767
01:27:26.250 --> 01:27:29.540
<v Speaker 3>and you and it's a big maze and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>mandela and,</v>

1768
01:27:29.620 --> 01:27:34.310
<v Speaker 3>and there's a kind of a flower shaped </v>
<v Speaker 3>resting place right in the center.</v>

1769
01:27:34.610 --> 01:27:38.870
<v Speaker 3>And what you're doing is walking in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>maze and you walk all four quadrants and</v>

1770
01:27:38.871 --> 01:27:41.000
<v Speaker 3>you get to the middle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is where you want to be.</v>

1771
01:27:41.050 --> 01:27:42.790
<v Speaker 3>You want to be in the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1772
01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:43.633
<v Speaker 3>how do you get there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You walk everywhere aNd what does that </v>

1773
01:27:45.621 --> 01:27:46.454
<v Speaker 3>mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It means every bloody time you're </v>

1774
01:27:47.421 --> 01:27:52.400
<v Speaker 3>offered an opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take it and develop your skills.</v>

1775
01:27:53.030 --> 01:27:55.490
<v Speaker 3>And that's better than wealth by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>

1776
01:27:55.550 --> 01:27:56.383
<v Speaker 3>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it actually constitutes wealth because </v>

1777
01:27:57.561 --> 01:28:00.770
<v Speaker 3>wealth constitutes what you have when </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone takes all your money away,</v>

1778
01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:02.990
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's real wealth.</v>

1779
01:28:02.991 --> 01:28:06.230
<v Speaker 3>And so the way that you build up that </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of wealth is you turn yourself into</v>

1780
01:28:06.231 --> 01:28:10.640
<v Speaker 3>someone who's competent in multiple </v>
<v Speaker 3>directions and you can be doing that all</v>

1781
01:28:10.641 --> 01:28:11.600
<v Speaker 3>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1782
01:28:11.750 --> 01:28:14.630
<v Speaker 3>Especially with the kind of technology </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you people have access to.</v>

1783
01:28:14.690 --> 01:28:16.970
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can learn anything you want whenever</v>

1784
01:28:16.971 --> 01:28:18.980
<v Speaker 3>you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what a good deal that is,</v>

1785
01:28:18.981 --> 01:28:20.870
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so there's,</v>

1786
01:28:20.930 --> 01:28:21.763
<v Speaker 3>there's easy fruit hanging that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>could pick and I would recommend that </v>

1787
01:28:24.291 --> 01:28:25.124
<v Speaker 3>you do that.</v>
