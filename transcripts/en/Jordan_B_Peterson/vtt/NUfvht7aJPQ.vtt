1
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:03.503
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to continue with our </v>

2
00:00:07.501 --> 00:00:11.220
<v Speaker 1>discussion of clinical personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>theories today,</v>

3
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.710
<v Speaker 1>moving away from the psychoanalytic or </v>
<v Speaker 1>depth.</v>

4
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.540
<v Speaker 1>Psychoanalytic theorists are the depths </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologists.</v>

5
00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.750
<v Speaker 1>We're just start to talk about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenologists,</v>

6
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:22.603
<v Speaker 1>send the existentialists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I need to lay down a little bit </v>

7
00:00:25.321 --> 00:00:30.321
<v Speaker 1>of background first and I think we'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>start with a discussion of phenomenology</v>

8
00:00:33.541 --> 00:00:38.010
<v Speaker 1>and existentialism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now for the phenomenologists,</v>

9
00:00:38.011 --> 00:00:38.844
<v Speaker 1>this is a tricky concept to grasp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'll actually start by telling </v>

10
00:00:45.151 --> 00:00:45.984
<v Speaker 1>you that something you've taught,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that Carl Jung wrote about in </v>

11
00:00:49.141 --> 00:00:52.670
<v Speaker 1>the last book he published,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was called Ms Dot Miriam Shin us,</v>

12
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.880
<v Speaker 1>which means mysterious conjunction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

13
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.200
<v Speaker 1>he sort of believed posited that there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was some extensions of moral development</v>

14
00:01:04.561 --> 00:01:09.561
<v Speaker 1>past the higher levels of moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>development that piaget identified.</v>

15
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.140
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there were three of them.</v>

16
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.300
<v Speaker 1>And he said they could be symbolized by </v>
<v Speaker 1>masculine,</v>

17
00:01:18.301 --> 00:01:19.134
<v Speaker 1>feminine to junctions or that they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the literature that he had </v>

18
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.553
<v Speaker 1>researched,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was mostly l chemical literature </v>

19
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.660
<v Speaker 1>from the late Middle Ages.</v>

20
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.120
<v Speaker 1>He said that one of the goals of moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>development or of psychotherapy</v>

21
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.460
<v Speaker 1>with the producer union,</v>
<v Speaker 1>between the emotions and the motivations</v>

22
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.503
<v Speaker 1>and rationality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can see that that's actually </v>

23
00:01:45.031 --> 00:01:49.550
<v Speaker 1>been a theme for all of the theorists </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we've talked about so far,</v>

24
00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:50.453
<v Speaker 1>made partly what psychotherapy or </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality development seems to be </v>

25
00:01:54.211 --> 00:01:55.044
<v Speaker 1>about is the continual integration of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the personality so that the person's </v>

26
00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:01.093
<v Speaker 1>psyche isn't at odds with itself and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>can move forward with a minimum of </v>

27
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.060
<v Speaker 1>conflict at something related to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Piagetian idea of an elevated state.</v>

28
00:02:09.061 --> 00:02:10.860
<v Speaker 1>So if you're in an equivalent rate </v>
<v Speaker 1>state,</v>

29
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.290
<v Speaker 1>you don't have the sense that there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>parts of you warring against other parts</v>

30
00:02:16.291 --> 00:02:17.124
<v Speaker 1>because you've been able to weave </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything together into a coherent </v>

31
00:02:20.401 --> 00:02:23.310
<v Speaker 1>identity that covers the past and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>present and the future.</v>

32
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.043
<v Speaker 1>So the first stage in use vision of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>constituted higher development was the </v>

33
00:02:29.671 --> 00:02:33.720
<v Speaker 1>union of the of rationality with emotion</v>
<v Speaker 1>and motivation.</v>

34
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.553
<v Speaker 1>And he saw that that was symbolized in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the literature that he had reviewed by </v>

35
00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.373
<v Speaker 1>masculine spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feminine emotions and and motivation </v>

36
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.333
<v Speaker 1>bank together in one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that then would be the united mind </v>

37
00:02:49.321 --> 00:02:50.154
<v Speaker 1>and spirit in a sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the next stage which was </v>

38
00:02:53.821 --> 00:02:57.750
<v Speaker 1>symbolized again by the masculine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feminine symbolism.</v>

39
00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.290
<v Speaker 1>It was the union united</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind spirit.</v>

40
00:03:02.291 --> 00:03:03.124
<v Speaker 1>With the body and so what that would </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean is that once you got your act </v>

41
00:03:06.641 --> 00:03:08.290
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

42
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:09.573
<v Speaker 1>you would implement it in your behavior </v>
<v Speaker 1>so that there was no contradictions </v>

43
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.400
<v Speaker 1>between who you were in terms of how you</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>

44
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.430
<v Speaker 1>how you felt and what you wanted and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you were actually doing.</v>

45
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.340
<v Speaker 1>Modern philosophers that describe what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they call a performative contradiction,</v>

46
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.880
<v Speaker 1>which they've formally described as it </v>
<v Speaker 1>another type of of light,</v>

47
00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.060
<v Speaker 1>essentially another type of deceit which</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you say one thing and do another</v>

48
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.400
<v Speaker 1>and it and and it's interesting because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

49
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:40.773
<v Speaker 1>It's not a logical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a form of logical deceit in a </v>

50
00:03:45.221 --> 00:03:46.054
<v Speaker 1>sense because your conceptualizations </v>
<v Speaker 1>are abstract and your behavior is </v>

51
00:03:49.511 --> 00:03:50.344
<v Speaker 1>concrete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there can still be a contradiction </v>

52
00:03:52.331 --> 00:03:53.164
<v Speaker 1>between the two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when you start to understand </v>

53
00:03:54.551 --> 00:03:55.384
<v Speaker 1>that most of what your psyche is </v>
<v Speaker 1>representing our Schema for action </v>

54
00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:00.663
<v Speaker 1>rather than for representation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the point is is that once your </v>

55
00:04:06.851 --> 00:04:11.230
<v Speaker 1>emotions and your motivations are </v>
<v Speaker 1>working alongside your rational mind,</v>

56
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:12.573
<v Speaker 1>really that your rational mind is </v>
<v Speaker 1>property nested within them because </v>

57
00:04:14.771 --> 00:04:15.604
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a much more accurate way of </v>

58
00:04:16.361 --> 00:04:19.240
<v Speaker 1>looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the next thing you should do is act</v>

59
00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.720
<v Speaker 1>consistently in accordance with who you </v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

60
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.520
<v Speaker 1>So that stage to both of those stages </v>
<v Speaker 1>are pretty easy to understand,</v>

61
00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.660
<v Speaker 1>but the third stage is actually a </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenal logical stage.</v>

62
00:04:31.661 --> 00:04:34.150
<v Speaker 1>You have to think phenomenologically to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand it.</v>

63
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.960
<v Speaker 1>So here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's one way of thinking about it.</v>

64
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.960
<v Speaker 1>So imagine that you go home and let's </v>
<v Speaker 1>say you set up a room and uh,</v>

65
00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.180
<v Speaker 1>in that room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a very nice room.</v>

66
00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:50.043
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you've got some posters on the </v>

67
00:04:51.071 --> 00:04:53.920
<v Speaker 1>wall and they're sort of hanging a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little cockeyed and you know,</v>

68
00:04:53.921 --> 00:04:57.120
<v Speaker 1>there's dust bunnies are making </v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath the bad.</v>

69
00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:57.993
<v Speaker 1>Then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have piles of paperwork that you </v>

70
00:05:01.421 --> 00:05:05.290
<v Speaker 1>haven't done and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>homework and you know,</v>

71
00:05:05.291 --> 00:05:06.124
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's the odd cresta brand or so</v>
<v Speaker 1>forth lying about when you walk in </v>

72
00:05:10.061 --> 00:05:15.061
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's you in the room.</v>

73
00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:16.473
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of thinking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But another way of thinking about it is </v>

74
00:05:19.151 --> 00:05:24.151
<v Speaker 1>that when you walk in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are in the room just like you're the</v>

75
00:05:24.461 --> 00:05:25.294
<v Speaker 1>room when you're here because the room </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes up a part of what you're </v>

76
00:05:29.081 --> 00:05:29.914
<v Speaker 1>experiencing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the phenomenologists would say in a </v>

77
00:05:33.461 --> 00:05:34.294
<v Speaker 1>sense that the best way to conceptualize</v>
<v Speaker 1>the self in its totality is what you </v>

78
00:05:40.541 --> 00:05:41.374
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like everything that you experienced as </v>

79
00:05:43.541 --> 00:05:44.374
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

80
00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:45.693
<v Speaker 1>And so what that would mean is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no difference between putting </v>

81
00:05:48.971 --> 00:05:49.804
<v Speaker 1>the posters up on your wall properly and</v>
<v Speaker 1>cleaning underneath the bed and maybe </v>

82
00:05:53.981 --> 00:05:58.280
<v Speaker 1>making it and finishing your homework </v>
<v Speaker 1>and putting the room in so that you feel</v>

83
00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.353
<v Speaker 1>confident and calm there and maybe even </v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoy being there or maybe even so that </v>

84
00:06:03.531 --> 00:06:04.364
<v Speaker 1>it's beautiful there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no difference between that and </v>

85
00:06:07.431 --> 00:06:11.780
<v Speaker 1>fixing up your own personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you could say,</v>

86
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.710
<v Speaker 1>here's another way of looking at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I do this.</v>

87
00:06:15.711 --> 00:06:18.440
<v Speaker 1>I believe that this is a very profound </v>
<v Speaker 1>way of looking at things.</v>

88
00:06:18.441 --> 00:06:21.450
<v Speaker 1>So then imagine that you could extend </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you,</v>

89
00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:22.293
<v Speaker 1>but it's kind of easy to understand when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think about it as your own room </v>

90
00:06:24.381 --> 00:06:25.214
<v Speaker 1>because you're in there quite a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe let's say you're in your </v>

91
00:06:26.871 --> 00:06:27.704
<v Speaker 1>room 10 percent of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we could say that the experiences </v>

92
00:06:31.311 --> 00:06:35.090
<v Speaker 1>that characterize your room are 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent of you,</v>

93
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:36.440
<v Speaker 1>at least for the time being.</v>

94
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:37.483
<v Speaker 1>And that you can have a low quality </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience in their high quality </v>

95
00:06:39.951 --> 00:06:42.420
<v Speaker 1>experience in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

96
00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:44.413
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't say that you start generalizing </v>

97
00:06:45.381 --> 00:06:48.620
<v Speaker 1>that to the whole house and also then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can start thinking,</v>

98
00:06:48.621 --> 00:06:49.454
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are their problematic places in the </v>

99
00:06:51.591 --> 00:06:52.424
<v Speaker 1>house or they're problematic </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships among the people in the </v>

100
00:06:54.951 --> 00:06:59.630
<v Speaker 1>house and those problematic </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships are also you.</v>

101
00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:05.980
<v Speaker 1>And you can tell when there's a problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you encounter undesired negative</v>

102
00:07:06.141 --> 00:07:06.974
<v Speaker 1>emotion in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in relationship to some relationship or </v>

103
00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:14.000
<v Speaker 1>in some physical locale within the </v>
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

104
00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:16.520
<v Speaker 1>And maybe you could fix that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

105
00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:20.270
<v Speaker 1>little incremental bit by incremental </v>
<v Speaker 1>Beck you could work on that.</v>

106
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:21.133
<v Speaker 1>You could note that the negative emotion</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you don't want to have a rise </v>

107
00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:29.780
<v Speaker 1>signifies something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It signifies that that situation in some</v>

108
00:07:29.781 --> 00:07:33.920
<v Speaker 1>sense non optimal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you could work on strategies to</v>

109
00:07:33.921 --> 00:07:38.921
<v Speaker 1>optimize that and you don't do that </v>
<v Speaker 1>until you stop making the presupposition</v>

110
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:41.720
<v Speaker 1>that there's you.</v>

111
00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.910
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

112
00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.193
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the distinction between you and where </v>

113
00:07:47.091 --> 00:07:47.924
<v Speaker 1>you are is a very unclear distinction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then let's say you're walking down </v>

114
00:07:51.201 --> 00:07:52.034
<v Speaker 1>the street or you're going into a store </v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe your managers aren't as good </v>

115
00:07:56.871 --> 00:08:01.280
<v Speaker 1>as they could be because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be really socially sophisticated is a</v>

116
00:08:01.281 --> 00:08:02.510
<v Speaker 1>real art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can learn,</v>

117
00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:05.330
<v Speaker 1>it can take you decades to learn how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do that properly.</v>

118
00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:09.020
<v Speaker 1>And people who are really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really socially skilled have a much,</v>

119
00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:14.090
<v Speaker 1>much higher quality existence because no</v>
<v Speaker 1>matter where they go,</v>

120
00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:15.493
<v Speaker 1>they immediately established a </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with the people that </v>

121
00:08:17.211 --> 00:08:21.470
<v Speaker 1>they're talking to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it's not an impersonal and,</v>

122
00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:24.140
<v Speaker 1>and Dan doore aggravating interaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

123
00:08:24.141 --> 00:08:24.974
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they'll walk into a store and the </v>

124
00:08:26.421 --> 00:08:27.980
<v Speaker 1>first thing they do if someone comes up </v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

125
00:08:27.981 --> 00:08:30.650
<v Speaker 1>helps them as they look at the person </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

126
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:33.310
<v Speaker 1>ask them how they're doing and how their</v>
<v Speaker 1>day has been.</v>

127
00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:36.170
<v Speaker 1>And they make a little relationship and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

128
00:08:36.171 --> 00:08:37.004
<v Speaker 1>the person is kind of happy about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it sort of pops them out of </v>

129
00:08:39.051 --> 00:08:42.560
<v Speaker 1>their persona role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it can have a little discussion</v>

130
00:08:42.561 --> 00:08:44.810
<v Speaker 1>about what they're doing in the store </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what they want.</v>

131
00:08:44.811 --> 00:08:46.970
<v Speaker 1>And then all of a sudden it's a high </v>
<v Speaker 1>quality experience.</v>

132
00:08:46.971 --> 00:08:48.710
<v Speaker 1>And that person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere they go,</v>

133
00:08:48.711 --> 00:08:49.544
<v Speaker 1>if they're skilled blight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that so they're awake and they're </v>

134
00:08:51.351 --> 00:08:53.780
<v Speaker 1>attentive and they're listening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere they go,</v>

135
00:08:53.781 --> 00:08:55.800
<v Speaker 1>they can have a high quality </v>
<v Speaker 1>interaction.</v>

136
00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:59.340
<v Speaker 1>You know when people who learn how to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

137
00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:00.233
<v Speaker 1>learn to do it partly by noticing when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're in an interaction with someone </v>

138
00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:05.783
<v Speaker 1>or somewhere that if it isn't going in </v>
<v Speaker 1>an optimal manner or if it's producing </v>

139
00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:12.593
<v Speaker 1>undesired negative emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's something wrong with the </v>

140
00:09:15.451 --> 00:09:16.284
<v Speaker 1>way that they're being in that situation</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they pay attention to that and see </v>

141
00:09:19.561 --> 00:09:20.910
<v Speaker 1>if they could figure out how to modify </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

142
00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:25.080
<v Speaker 1>A lot of it is attention and listening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is there are key components to say</v>

143
00:09:25.081 --> 00:09:30.081
<v Speaker 1>that Rogerian psychotherapist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 attention and listening so</v>

144
00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:34.980
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

145
00:09:34.981 --> 00:09:39.780
<v Speaker 1>so so you can go into your room and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can identify little problems that are in</v>

146
00:09:39.781 --> 00:09:43.140
<v Speaker 1>your room that you could fix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that maybe you would fix.</v>

147
00:09:43.141 --> 00:09:43.974
<v Speaker 1>And so then you can start fixing them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that improves the quality of that </v>

148
00:09:46.231 --> 00:09:47.064
<v Speaker 1>particular environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you could start to generalize </v>

149
00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:50.490
<v Speaker 1>beyond,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

150
00:09:50.491 --> 00:09:55.440
<v Speaker 1>the locales that are more specifically </v>
<v Speaker 1>under your control.</v>

151
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:58.020
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're walking down flora,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

152
00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:00.510
<v Speaker 1>and you go into a store and you talk to </v>
<v Speaker 1>a clerk,</v>

153
00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:01.823
<v Speaker 1>well the probability is pretty high that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the clerk is at least reasonably </v>

154
00:10:04.231 --> 00:10:05.064
<v Speaker 1>functional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you shouldn't be able to get beyond </v>

155
00:10:06.721 --> 00:10:07.554
<v Speaker 1>their barriers in a sense and have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>genuine interaction with them without </v>

156
00:10:11.101 --> 00:10:11.934
<v Speaker 1>too much difficulty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then maybe you're wandering down </v>

157
00:10:13.831 --> 00:10:18.180
<v Speaker 1>bluer and you run across someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>schizophrenia and maybe alcoholic at the</v>

158
00:10:18.181 --> 00:10:22.110
<v Speaker 1>same time and while that's a part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your experience,</v>

159
00:10:22.111 --> 00:10:25.680
<v Speaker 1>that might supersede your ability to </v>
<v Speaker 1>transform.</v>

160
00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:28.470
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The phenomenologists.</v>

161
00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:30.143
<v Speaker 1>People like Rogers aren't making the </v>
<v Speaker 1>claim that you should be able to solve </v>

162
00:10:32.941 --> 00:10:33.774
<v Speaker 1>every problem that you've come across or</v>
<v Speaker 1>even that you should try because </v>

163
00:10:37.171 --> 00:10:41.610
<v Speaker 1>there'll be things that you experienced </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are so complex and problematic that</v>

164
00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:43.910
<v Speaker 1>you might make the Morris.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you fiddle around with them.</v>

165
00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:44.793
<v Speaker 1>You know you gotta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be Very careful not to extend yourself </v>

166
00:10:49.201 --> 00:10:50.034
<v Speaker 1>dramatically beyond your skill level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can certainly start in isolated </v>

167
00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:57.063
<v Speaker 1>locales and if you stopped presuming a </v>
<v Speaker 1>priority that there's some radical </v>

168
00:11:01.471 --> 00:11:02.304
<v Speaker 1>distinction between you and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment that you happen to be in </v>

169
00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:06.533
<v Speaker 1>because it's all your experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you start making that subject object </v>

170
00:11:11.131 --> 00:11:11.964
<v Speaker 1>distinction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the things that </v>

171
00:11:12.721 --> 00:11:13.554
<v Speaker 1>phenomenologists really objected to </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they concentrated on being in </v>

172
00:11:16.441 --> 00:11:17.274
<v Speaker 1>such,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was sort of lived experience as </v>

173
00:11:19.681 --> 00:11:20.514
<v Speaker 1>the ground of reality rather than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>objective world is the ground of </v>

174
00:11:23.671 --> 00:11:24.504
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

175
00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:27.270
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

176
00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:28.163
<v Speaker 1>if you allow yourself to step outside </v>
<v Speaker 1>that dichotomy and you start to </v>

177
00:11:32.521 --> 00:11:33.354
<v Speaker 1>understand that wherever you go and </v>
<v Speaker 1>including the places that you're in a </v>

178
00:11:37.021 --> 00:11:41.130
<v Speaker 1>lot that there's no distinction between </v>
<v Speaker 1>fixing up those places.</v>

179
00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:42.803
<v Speaker 1>When you notice that there's something </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong with them and you could fix them </v>

180
00:11:44.671 --> 00:11:47.070
<v Speaker 1>up and fixing yourself up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

181
00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:48.123
<v Speaker 1>it opens up a whole new avenue to </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting your life together because you </v>

182
00:11:51.811 --> 00:11:54.340
<v Speaker 1>know people always think they have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>work themselves.</v>

183
00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:55.593
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is one of the things that the </v>

184
00:11:57.281 --> 00:11:59.980
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalysts I think didn't get quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

185
00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:02.950
<v Speaker 1>Although young touchstone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is later words,</v>

186
00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:04.973
<v Speaker 1>there's not all of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't inside your head for the </v>

187
00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:11.050
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalysts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of what the work that you're doing</v>

188
00:12:11.051 --> 00:12:13.330
<v Speaker 1>on yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on your own,</v>

189
00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:14.193
<v Speaker 1>on the relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say between your conscious and your </v>

190
00:12:15.641 --> 00:12:16.474
<v Speaker 1>unconscious mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but tremendous amount of that was sort </v>

191
00:12:18.041 --> 00:12:20.170
<v Speaker 1>of inside your skull,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

192
00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:21.873
<v Speaker 1>but the phenomenologists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the phenomenal logical approach enables </v>

193
00:12:26.021 --> 00:12:26.854
<v Speaker 1>you to start reconceptualizing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>psyche if as something that extends </v>

194
00:12:31.631 --> 00:12:36.190
<v Speaker 1>beyond you and always will and so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can work on it's reconstruction</v>

195
00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:39.063
<v Speaker 1>at any level of analysis where your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>nervous system is signaling to you that </v>

196
00:12:44.141 --> 00:12:44.980
<v Speaker 1>there's a problem.</v>

197
00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:48.760
<v Speaker 1>The way it does that is well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a variety of ways,</v>

198
00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:53.470
<v Speaker 1>but to have the most reliable ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our negative emotion.</v>

199
00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:55.503
<v Speaker 1>There's a new paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example that shows that </v>

200
00:12:57.310 --> 00:13:01.360
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness is quite tightly </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with proneness to guilt,</v>

201
00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:04.660
<v Speaker 1>so that's the negative emotion that </v>
<v Speaker 1>seems to go with conscientiousness.</v>

202
00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:06.243
<v Speaker 1>So guilt and anxiety and shame and no </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of emotions which are unpleasant </v>

203
00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:14.880
<v Speaker 1>also simultaneously signal the presence </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a problem and so you and and and what</v>

204
00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:17.080
<v Speaker 1>resentment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another good one.</v>

205
00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:18.063
<v Speaker 1>So you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of having those emotions as </v>

206
00:13:19.481 --> 00:13:20.201
<v Speaker 1>entities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd say,</v>

207
00:13:20.201 --> 00:13:21.790
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want that to go away.</v>

208
00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:22.900
<v Speaker 1>You can think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

209
00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:25.270
<v Speaker 1>there's my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

210
00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:30.420
<v Speaker 1>my being I embody being is signaling to </v>
<v Speaker 1>me that something is not optimal here.</v>

211
00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:33.530
<v Speaker 1>And then it's not an enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

212
00:13:33.531 --> 00:13:35.950
<v Speaker 1>it's because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something that's trying to improve,</v>

213
00:13:35.951 --> 00:13:38.830
<v Speaker 1>say the quality of your present </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience on your future experience and</v>

214
00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:40.173
<v Speaker 1>if you don't push that aside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're pretending it's not happening or </v>

215
00:13:42.821 --> 00:13:43.654
<v Speaker 1>assumed instantaneously that it's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fault of the environment or the person </v>

216
00:13:46.451 --> 00:13:47.284
<v Speaker 1>that you're talking to.</v>

217
00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:48.543
<v Speaker 1>Then that can be incredibly instructive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Negative emotion is incredibly </v>

218
00:13:51.821 --> 00:13:52.654
<v Speaker 1>instructive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to adjust your attitude so </v>

219
00:13:54.791 --> 00:13:55.624
<v Speaker 1>that you understand that it's signaling </v>
<v Speaker 1>to you the presence of corrective </v>

220
00:13:59.651 --> 00:14:00.484
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you could just figure out what that </v>

221
00:14:01.391 --> 00:14:03.610
<v Speaker 1>information is and that can come from </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone,</v>

222
00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:06.580
<v Speaker 1>a person or a place or a thing or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

223
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.720
<v Speaker 1>or yourself or you don't need to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>the distinctions,</v>

224
00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:13.450
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're having an argument with</v>

225
00:14:13.451 --> 00:14:16.450
<v Speaker 1>your partner and it's not going very </v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

226
00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:17.963
<v Speaker 1>I mean it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a tremendous tendency among </v>

227
00:14:21.311 --> 00:14:24.430
<v Speaker 1>people to try to win an argument with </v>
<v Speaker 1>their partner,</v>

228
00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:26.103
<v Speaker 1>but you can't win an argument with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>partner because then you win and they </v>

229
00:14:29.321 --> 00:14:33.820
<v Speaker 1>lose and then you have a loser on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>hands and if you do that 100 times,</v>

230
00:14:33.821 --> 00:14:36.220
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're better at arguments than </v>
<v Speaker 1>they are,</v>

231
00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:37.750
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>

232
00:14:37.751 --> 00:14:38.584
<v Speaker 1>or maybe they think more in an intuitive</v>
<v Speaker 1>way so they can't dance on their feet </v>

233
00:14:41.801 --> 00:14:42.940
<v Speaker 1>quite as fast as you.</v>

234
00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:47.560
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe the situation is reversed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you in the bloody argument 100 times,</v>

235
00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:49.053
<v Speaker 1>you're not a winner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just someone who's beat up your </v>

236
00:14:51.561 --> 00:14:52.394
<v Speaker 1>partner 100 times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you want to find out is what the </v>

237
00:14:54.651 --> 00:14:55.484
<v Speaker 1>hell is it that they're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes that takes a tremendous </v>

238
00:14:58.461 --> 00:14:59.294
<v Speaker 1>amount of patients.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should be doing the same thing to </v>

239
00:15:00.651 --> 00:15:01.484
<v Speaker 1>you because very frequently the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people are arguing about are only </v>

240
00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:06.273
<v Speaker 1>the tiny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the snow on the surface of of </v>

241
00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:12.890
<v Speaker 1>a glazier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real argument is deep,</v>

242
00:15:12.891 --> 00:15:14.090
<v Speaker 1>deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep underneath,</v>

243
00:15:14.091 --> 00:15:18.440
<v Speaker 1>and unless you listen intently and for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>long period of time,</v>

244
00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:19.933
<v Speaker 1>you'll never figure out what it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're arguing about and then if you </v>

245
00:15:22.671 --> 00:15:23.504
<v Speaker 1>win,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the person won't be able to talk about </v>

246
00:15:25.071 --> 00:15:25.904
<v Speaker 1>it and that problem will be there for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of your relationship and maybe </v>

247
00:15:28.131 --> 00:15:30.740
<v Speaker 1>for the rest of your life unless you </v>
<v Speaker 1>solve the problem,</v>

248
00:15:30.741 --> 00:15:31.850
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to go away.</v>

249
00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:34.003
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to start talking about Roger </v>

250
00:15:37.131 --> 00:15:41.660
<v Speaker 1>specifically by</v>
<v Speaker 1>by going over some of the things that he</v>

251
00:15:41.661 --> 00:15:42.494
<v Speaker 1>had to say about listening because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think I've learned more about listening </v>

252
00:15:46.521 --> 00:15:47.354
<v Speaker 1>from Rogers than for many other </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality theorists or or </v>

253
00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:55.630
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapists that I've encountered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we could go back to the fundamentals</v>

254
00:15:56.061 --> 00:15:56.894
<v Speaker 1>of psychotherapy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mean really what you're doing in </v>

255
00:15:59.901 --> 00:16:04.901
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapy is trying to help the </v>
<v Speaker 1>person become a better person and that's</v>

256
00:16:05.121 --> 00:16:07.850
<v Speaker 1>not exactly a scientific formulation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>better person.</v>

257
00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:08.783
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a tricky thing to get at </v>

258
00:16:10.071 --> 00:16:13.820
<v Speaker 1>because people can be bitter persons in </v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of different ways.</v>

259
00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:18.930
<v Speaker 1>Nearly the fact that your people theory </v>
<v Speaker 1>in their temperaments indicates that you</v>

260
00:16:18.931 --> 00:16:19.764
<v Speaker 1>know your way of being a better person </v>
<v Speaker 1>and your way of being a better person </v>

261
00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:25.430
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't necessarily be the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

262
00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:26.353
<v Speaker 1>because you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like maybe someone's grade on the </v>

263
00:16:28.221 --> 00:16:30.200
<v Speaker 1>violin and another person is great on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the piano.</v>

264
00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:31.843
<v Speaker 1>The grades the same but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the instrument is different and I </v>

265
00:16:34.451 --> 00:16:36.320
<v Speaker 1>think and that's a good way of looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>at it.</v>

266
00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:40.010
<v Speaker 1>And so part of what you do in </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapy,</v>

267
00:16:40.011 --> 00:16:42.110
<v Speaker 1>and I think you do this in any genuine </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>

268
00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:46.730
<v Speaker 1>is not only is the dialogue about how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>become a better person.</v>

269
00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:47.713
<v Speaker 1>That continuing dialogue is also always </v>
<v Speaker 1>about just exactly what constitutes a </v>

270
00:16:51.501 --> 00:16:54.260
<v Speaker 1>better person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're talking about the goal and the</v>

271
00:16:54.261 --> 00:16:55.094
<v Speaker 1>process at the same time and what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing is working it out so that the </v>

272
00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:03.500
<v Speaker 1>people go into the conversation with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>specific orientation and the orientation</v>

273
00:17:03.501 --> 00:17:04.334
<v Speaker 1>is generally with client and therapist </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the client comes with it with a </v>

274
00:17:08.361 --> 00:17:09.194
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their life isn't acceptable in its </v>

275
00:17:10.851 --> 00:17:11.684
<v Speaker 1>current form and they come with one more</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing which is the desire to make it </v>

276
00:17:15.651 --> 00:17:16.690
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And.</v>

277
00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:19.940
<v Speaker 1>And something that you should all know </v>
<v Speaker 1>because this will stop you from tangling</v>

278
00:17:19.941 --> 00:17:22.670
<v Speaker 1>yourself up in your life to a tremendous</v>
<v Speaker 1>degree.</v>

279
00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:23.563
<v Speaker 1>You cannot help someone who hasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>decided that they want things to be </v>

280
00:17:28.701 --> 00:17:32.420
<v Speaker 1>better unless they make the decision </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they want to make things better.</v>

281
00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:35.390
<v Speaker 1>Forget it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're wasting your time and all it will</v>

282
00:17:35.391 --> 00:17:38.390
<v Speaker 1>do is hurt you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I should also tell you that that was</v>

283
00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:39.224
<v Speaker 1>one of Roger's necessary preconditions </v>
<v Speaker 1>for psychotherapy and other one was </v>

284
00:17:42.951 --> 00:17:47.330
<v Speaker 1>honesty and communication,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the person who was coming in for the</v>

285
00:17:47.331 --> 00:17:48.164
<v Speaker 1>therapeutic process had to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a weird thing and I don't know </v>

286
00:17:52.741 --> 00:17:56.200
<v Speaker 1>how to account for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think that you could talk to</v>

287
00:17:56.201 --> 00:18:01.201
<v Speaker 1>someone who doesn't want to have things </v>
<v Speaker 1>be better into warranty,</v>

288
00:18:01.261 --> 00:18:04.230
<v Speaker 1>that they have to come to that decision </v>
<v Speaker 1>on their own.</v>

289
00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:07.170
<v Speaker 1>So they come in with having made that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

290
00:18:07.171 --> 00:18:07.951
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>

291
00:18:07.951 --> 00:18:08.784
<v Speaker 1>very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's impossible to do </v>

292
00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:13.500
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapy with someone who's been </v>
<v Speaker 1>remanded by the court,</v>

293
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:15.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're,</v>

294
00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:17.670
<v Speaker 1>they're in voluntarily and they'll just </v>
<v Speaker 1>put a wall,</v>

295
00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:18.030
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

296
00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:18.863
<v Speaker 1>Not always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of the time they'll just put </v>

297
00:18:19.771 --> 00:18:21.680
<v Speaker 1>up a wall and just wait it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

298
00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:22.973
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to get in there with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>screwdriver and pry off that Shell so </v>

299
00:18:27.931 --> 00:18:30.900
<v Speaker 1>the person has to step forward in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense and say,</v>

300
00:18:30.901 --> 00:18:31.734
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

301
00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:35.250
<v Speaker 1>there's something not right about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way things are going for me and it could</v>

302
00:18:35.251 --> 00:18:39.720
<v Speaker 1>be better and I and someone else might </v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to help me figure that out.</v>

303
00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:41.093
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a really good attitude to </v>

304
00:18:41.851 --> 00:18:42.541
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

305
00:18:42.541 --> 00:18:43.374
<v Speaker 1>when you're listening to someone because</v>
<v Speaker 1>disagree with them or not or agree with </v>

306
00:18:46.561 --> 00:18:49.500
<v Speaker 1>them or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always the possibility that they</v>

307
00:18:49.501 --> 00:18:50.334
<v Speaker 1>will tell you something you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like lots of times when people are </v>

308
00:18:53.731 --> 00:18:54.564
<v Speaker 1>talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're trying to do is to impose </v>

309
00:18:56.341 --> 00:18:57.174
<v Speaker 1>their viewpoint on another person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In your conversations like this all the </v>

310
00:18:59.641 --> 00:19:01.410
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their arguments really.</v>

311
00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:05.250
<v Speaker 1>And they're often ideological arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're right and I'm wrong,</v>

312
00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:07.920
<v Speaker 1>or sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that never happens</v>

313
00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:10.373
<v Speaker 1>when I braid in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're wrong and I'm just going to hack </v>

314
00:19:11.851 --> 00:19:15.390
<v Speaker 1>it you until you shut up or you agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>

315
00:19:15.391 --> 00:19:18.120
<v Speaker 1>you'll never agree because you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get someone to agree that way.</v>

316
00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:19.260
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not possible,</v>

317
00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:20.393
<v Speaker 1>but you might be able to allow them into</v>
<v Speaker 1>silence or anger and but that's a </v>

318
00:19:25.321 --> 00:19:28.080
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a real conversation.</v>

319
00:19:28.081 --> 00:19:31.250
<v Speaker 1>It's just all you're doing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>establishing that you're,</v>

320
00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:32.213
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lobster with bigger claws than than </v>

321
00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:36.540
<v Speaker 1>the person that you're trying to pick </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

322
00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:38.273
<v Speaker 1>A therapeutic conversation which is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>genuine conversation is one in which </v>

323
00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:46.550
<v Speaker 1>both the people in the conversation are </v>
<v Speaker 1>oriented towards a higher state of being</v>

324
00:19:47.641 --> 00:19:50.040
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're conversing and you can tell when</v>

325
00:19:50.041 --> 00:19:51.870
<v Speaker 1>you're in a conversation like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's very,</v>

326
00:19:51.871 --> 00:19:52.800
<v Speaker 1>very engaging.</v>

327
00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:56.430
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the conversation isn't engaging,</v>

328
00:19:57.030 --> 00:19:57.863
<v Speaker 1>then that's a sign that you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>having a conversation and that's really </v>

329
00:20:00.841 --> 00:20:04.290
<v Speaker 1>useful thing to know too because here's </v>
<v Speaker 1>another thing I can tell you that if you</v>

330
00:20:04.291 --> 00:20:06.840
<v Speaker 1>take to heart will save you an awful lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of grief and misery.</v>

331
00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:11.400
<v Speaker 1>If you're talking to someone and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>not listening,</v>

332
00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:15.030
<v Speaker 1>shut up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just stop.</v>

333
00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:18.380
<v Speaker 1>It's like you can tell if they're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>listening and if they're not listening,</v>

334
00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:19.950
<v Speaker 1>quit saying words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll take.</v>

335
00:20:19.951 --> 00:20:21.720
<v Speaker 1>You'll just feel like a fool anyways </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're,</v>

336
00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:24.840
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're throwing ping pong </v>
<v Speaker 1>balls against the brick wall,</v>

337
00:20:24.841 --> 00:20:26.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not getting anywhere.</v>

338
00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:29.430
<v Speaker 1>If they're not listening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a sign that the system,</v>

339
00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:30.293
<v Speaker 1>the situation isn't set up to allow you </v>
<v Speaker 1>to progress on the path that you're </v>

340
00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:35.573
<v Speaker 1>choosing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then you have to stop and you </v>

341
00:20:37.171 --> 00:20:37.621
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

342
00:20:37.621 --> 00:20:39.000
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on here?</v>

343
00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:41.190
<v Speaker 1>Why is the person who's listening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

344
00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:44.940
<v Speaker 1>am I being too forceful and my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do they not understand what I'm saying?</v>

345
00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:47.470
<v Speaker 1>Is it too much about me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

346
00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:50.410
<v Speaker 1>do they want to talk?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>

347
00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:53.290
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they don't want to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's all sorts of possibilities,</v>

348
00:20:53.291 --> 00:20:54.124
<v Speaker 1>but that's when you have to wake up past</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it is that you're trying to impose </v>

349
00:20:57.821 --> 00:21:01.300
<v Speaker 1>on the situation and explore and see </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's there.</v>

350
00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:04.480
<v Speaker 1>And that's way more interesting than </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to impose your viewpoint.</v>

351
00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:07.690
<v Speaker 1>The other thing is that if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to someone,</v>

352
00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:09.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to talk to people whose political</v>

353
00:21:09.911 --> 00:21:10.744
<v Speaker 1>beliefs are very different from mine </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I can really understand how </v>

354
00:21:14.861 --> 00:21:17.700
<v Speaker 1>someone's political beliefs can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>really different than mine.</v>

355
00:21:17.701 --> 00:21:18.534
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I got kind of a coherent </v>

356
00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:20.493
<v Speaker 1>representation of my beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's very interesting to talk to </v>

357
00:21:23.621 --> 00:21:26.500
<v Speaker 1>people who have radically different </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they'll tell you things that you</v>

358
00:21:26.501 --> 00:21:27.334
<v Speaker 1>haven't considered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean you have to agree with </v>

359
00:21:29.021 --> 00:21:31.000
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>

360
00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:32.043
<v Speaker 1>It's much more informative to walk away </v>
<v Speaker 1>from a conversation having learned </v>

361
00:21:35.471 --> 00:21:36.304
<v Speaker 1>something that you didn't know then it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is having won the stupid argument which </v>

362
00:21:39.911 --> 00:21:40.744
<v Speaker 1>you can't win anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's especially the case when </v>

363
00:21:43.601 --> 00:21:45.940
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with people who are close</v>
<v Speaker 1>to you,</v>

364
00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:47.813
<v Speaker 1>that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you will have around for the rest </v>

365
00:21:48.971 --> 00:21:49.804
<v Speaker 1>of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You cannot win an argument with them </v>

366
00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:54.250
<v Speaker 1>because all that will happen is if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>win,</v>

367
00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:58.240
<v Speaker 1>they'll get you back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sooner or later they will listen to you.</v>

368
00:21:58.241 --> 00:21:59.074
<v Speaker 1>The next time you have something to talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about or or they'll get resentful and </v>

369
00:22:01.751 --> 00:22:02.584
<v Speaker 1>then they won't be helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or if you just can't win an argument </v>

370
00:22:06.521 --> 00:22:09.220
<v Speaker 1>with someone that you will have repeated</v>
<v Speaker 1>contact with.</v>

371
00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:11.950
<v Speaker 1>What you can do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

372
00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:17.490
<v Speaker 1>is you can have a conversation that's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>real conversation and maybe you can come</v>

373
00:22:18.431 --> 00:22:22.630
<v Speaker 1>to terms about the thing that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussing and that's negotiation,</v>

374
00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:23.913
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

375
00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:25.570
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you want?</v>

376
00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:28.960
<v Speaker 1>But you have to really want to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're having an argument,</v>

377
00:22:28.961 --> 00:22:29.794
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it that I would have to do </v>

378
00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:33.273
<v Speaker 1>because we're having this argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would I have to do in order to </v>

379
00:22:35.171 --> 00:22:37.050
<v Speaker 1>satisfy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

380
00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:38.560
<v Speaker 1>And then at a personal thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not going,</v>

381
00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:40.230
<v Speaker 1>you can do to satisfy me because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

382
00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:41.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm so bad at you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

383
00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:44.140
<v Speaker 1>that's not helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other person has to think,</v>

384
00:22:44.141 --> 00:22:44.974
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the conditions for my </v>

385
00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:47.620
<v Speaker 1>satisfaction?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

386
00:22:47.621 --> 00:22:48.454
<v Speaker 1>so maybe you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your partner says you're not paying </v>

387
00:22:50.051 --> 00:22:51.780
<v Speaker 1>enough attention to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

388
00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:54.760
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you want?</v>

389
00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:57.100
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

390
00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:58.023
<v Speaker 1>you want to talk for 15 minutes at </v>
<v Speaker 1>breakfast or do you want to talk for 20 </v>

391
00:23:00.821 --> 00:23:03.880
<v Speaker 1>minutes at lunch or do you want to spend</v>
<v Speaker 1>an hour at night watching tv or,</v>

392
00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:05.013
<v Speaker 1>or like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you want me to act differently when </v>

393
00:23:06.071 --> 00:23:07.900
<v Speaker 1>they come home?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm at the door,</v>

394
00:23:07.901 --> 00:23:12.610
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're feeling unattended to </v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you want?</v>

395
00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:13.930
<v Speaker 1>Well then they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

396
00:23:13.931 --> 00:23:15.700
<v Speaker 1>if you love me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should be able to figure that out.</v>

397
00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:21.450
<v Speaker 2>That's</v>

398
00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:22.813
<v Speaker 1>wrong because you're stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You won't be able to figure that out </v>

399
00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:27.920
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell do you know?</v>

400
00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:31.250
<v Speaker 1>So the other person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless they want to corner you into just</v>

401
00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:33.710
<v Speaker 1>being the kind of loser who can figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>things out,</v>

402
00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:36.560
<v Speaker 1>which is why are they with you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you know,</v>

403
00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:39.200
<v Speaker 1>they need that to think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

404
00:23:39.201 --> 00:23:41.630
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it that I want from this person?</v>

405
00:23:41.631 --> 00:23:44.010
<v Speaker 1>What would constitute more attention?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

406
00:23:44.011 --> 00:23:47.540
<v Speaker 1>And that's making that argument much </v>
<v Speaker 1>more high resolution.</v>

407
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:50.960
<v Speaker 1>And then it gives the other person a </v>
<v Speaker 1>chance to actually respond.</v>

408
00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:51.913
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to allow your partner </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be a moron because of course they </v>

409
00:23:54.141 --> 00:23:56.120
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So once you've killed them,</v>

410
00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:59.180
<v Speaker 1>what you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to let them do it badly,</v>

411
00:23:59.181 --> 00:24:02.840
<v Speaker 1>like 10 times because they're never </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to do it right the first time.</v>

412
00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:06.950
<v Speaker 1>So sometimes when I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen,</v>

413
00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:12.500
<v Speaker 1>I've helped people sometimes with </v>
<v Speaker 1>marital problems and one of the things I</v>

414
00:24:12.501 --> 00:24:15.710
<v Speaker 1>often recommend is that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go on a date,</v>

415
00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:16.813
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they take each other away from the home </v>

416
00:24:18.741 --> 00:24:20.750
<v Speaker 1>where the kids are usually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe not,</v>

417
00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:22.790
<v Speaker 1>maybe they don't have kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter.</v>

418
00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:25.700
<v Speaker 1>And they do something that's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>focused on each other,</v>

419
00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:27.440
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course,</v>

420
00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:29.600
<v Speaker 1>first of all they tell me they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to do that.</v>

421
00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:31.460
<v Speaker 1>It's stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

422
00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:35.390
<v Speaker 1>it isn't by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not stupid.</v>

423
00:24:35.391 --> 00:24:36.051
<v Speaker 1>It's like through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

424
00:24:36.051 --> 00:24:38.840
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to go out and have an </v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoyable time with your partner.</v>

425
00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:43.400
<v Speaker 1>Do you think your relationship's gonna </v>
<v Speaker 1>survive when all you do is snipe at each</v>

426
00:24:43.401 --> 00:24:45.810
<v Speaker 1>other and do horrible things together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

427
00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:46.910
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not gonna work.</v>

428
00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:49.130
<v Speaker 1>So then they'll finally say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

429
00:24:49.131 --> 00:24:49.964
<v Speaker 1>well go on a date,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll both look disgusted by the whole </v>

430
00:24:52.071 --> 00:24:54.870
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they go and it's like,</v>

431
00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:56.600
<v Speaker 1>it's just miserable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

432
00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:58.063
<v Speaker 1>Like one person says something to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other that immediately sets them off </v>

433
00:25:01.011 --> 00:25:03.860
<v Speaker 1>when they're out in the date because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're kind of mad about going anyways.</v>

434
00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:04.903
<v Speaker 1>And then they come back and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that just didn't work and we're </v>

435
00:25:06.231 --> 00:25:07.310
<v Speaker 1>never going to do it again.</v>

436
00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:10.030
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

437
00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:11.163
<v Speaker 1>you're so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're telling me you're never going to </v>

438
00:25:12.321 --> 00:25:13.154
<v Speaker 1>go out and do something enjoyable with </v>
<v Speaker 1>your partner again because it didn't </v>

439
00:25:17.601 --> 00:25:21.110
<v Speaker 1>work very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like people don't think about it,</v>

440
00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:21.973
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like.</v>

441
00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:25.580
<v Speaker 1>So maybe when you take your partner out </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you haven't been getting along,</v>

442
00:25:25.581 --> 00:25:30.080
<v Speaker 1>it takes you like 10 times before you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a relatively okay time,</v>

443
00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:32.870
<v Speaker 1>but 10 times if you're going to go out </v>
<v Speaker 1>with them,</v>

444
00:25:32.871 --> 00:25:33.704
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well let's say you go out with them </v>

445
00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:36.463
<v Speaker 1>every two weeks is 25 times and let's </v>
<v Speaker 1>say you're going to be with them for 30 </v>

446
00:25:40.011 --> 00:25:41.840
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you manage to,</v>

447
00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:43.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get your act together.</v>

448
00:25:43.011 --> 00:25:46.790
<v Speaker 1>So that's 30 times 25,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's 750 times.</v>

449
00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:52.090
<v Speaker 1>So if you practice 10 times then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>might be able to have 740 good times out</v>

450
00:25:53.841 --> 00:25:54.500
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

451
00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:55.333
<v Speaker 1>And that's an underestimate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So 10 times of practicing is hardly a </v>

452
00:25:58.311 --> 00:26:00.800
<v Speaker 1>problem for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for that kind of return.</v>

453
00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:06.850
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is all part of this Rogerian.</v>

454
00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:08.433
<v Speaker 1>Like following this path is all part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this Rogerian process of listening and </v>

455
00:26:12.231 --> 00:26:16.490
<v Speaker 1>listening is trying to figure out what </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hell the other person is telling you</v>

456
00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:19.880
<v Speaker 1>and understanding at the same time that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't know.</v>

457
00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:22.100
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're upset,</v>

458
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:23.143
<v Speaker 1>they're not even sure what they're upset</v>
<v Speaker 1>about and they don't know what they </v>

459
00:26:24.891 --> 00:26:25.850
<v Speaker 1>want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

460
00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:27.710
<v Speaker 1>because you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can corner them by saying,</v>

461
00:26:27.711 --> 00:26:30.590
<v Speaker 1>well you want to be attended to more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you want?</v>

462
00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:33.830
<v Speaker 1>And they'll try some weird defense like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I told you already,</v>

463
00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:34.873
<v Speaker 1>like if you love me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you already know which is a cliche and </v>

464
00:26:38.871 --> 00:26:41.450
<v Speaker 1>it's a foolish cliched.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can't let that stop you.</v>

465
00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:43.173
<v Speaker 1>I should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should tell you the sorts of barriers </v>

466
00:26:44.491 --> 00:26:46.560
<v Speaker 1>that people will put up if you listen to</v>
<v Speaker 1>them too.</v>

467
00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:49.470
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

468
00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:52.140
<v Speaker 1>let me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me see if I can think about it for a</v>

469
00:26:52.141 --> 00:26:52.974
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>

470
00:27:00.490 --> 00:27:02.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well usually what happens is if you're,</v>

471
00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:05.500
<v Speaker 1>if you're pushing someone say this is in</v>
<v Speaker 1>listening sort of way,</v>

472
00:27:05.501 --> 00:27:06.700
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you want?</v>

473
00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:08.373
<v Speaker 1>Why do you want that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would be the conditions of your </v>

474
00:27:10.421 --> 00:27:11.254
<v Speaker 1>satisfaction?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're pushing them fairly hard to </v>

475
00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:13.473
<v Speaker 1>clearly articulate their concerns and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they're afraid to do that and </v>

476
00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:17.673
<v Speaker 1>if you're trying to hash out initial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people usually have like five routines </v>

477
00:27:20.111 --> 00:27:20.944
<v Speaker 1>they can go through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is they block you with some cliche </v>

478
00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:28.180
<v Speaker 1>or they say something annoying and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they've got one other verbal trick</v>

479
00:27:28.181 --> 00:27:30.820
<v Speaker 1>after that and then once you push </v>
<v Speaker 1>through that,</v>

480
00:27:30.970 --> 00:27:35.290
<v Speaker 1>then they cry or they get angry and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you still don't stop them,</v>

481
00:27:35.291 --> 00:27:36.124
<v Speaker 1>they stomp off and so if you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a successful conversation about </v>

482
00:27:40.331 --> 00:27:43.120
<v Speaker 1>something difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need a routine for each of those.</v>

483
00:27:43.121 --> 00:27:43.954
<v Speaker 1>It's like just because the person's </v>
<v Speaker 1>angry doesn't mean the conversation is </v>

484
00:27:47.411 --> 00:27:48.244
<v Speaker 1>over and just because the person price </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't necessarily mean that you're a </v>

485
00:27:51.581 --> 00:27:52.414
<v Speaker 1>sadist.</v>

486
00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:55.870
<v Speaker 1>It's often a law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Often tears are a trip.</v>

487
00:27:55.871 --> 00:27:56.704
<v Speaker 1>They mask anger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so and what the person is doing in part </v>

488
00:27:59.741 --> 00:28:00.574
<v Speaker 1>is they're using their emotions as it </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploratory technique to find out how </v>

489
00:28:05.081 --> 00:28:08.740
<v Speaker 1>important is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens if I just break down?</v>

490
00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:11.530
<v Speaker 1>Will the person shut up and if the </v>
<v Speaker 1>person shuts up,</v>

491
00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:12.000
<v Speaker 1>they think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

492
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.990
<v Speaker 1>that's not that important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

493
00:28:13.991 --> 00:28:15.910
<v Speaker 1>Because they been able to use a </v>
<v Speaker 1>technique.</v>

494
00:28:15.911 --> 00:28:18.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying this as conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's it's,</v>

495
00:28:18.181 --> 00:28:21.490
<v Speaker 1>it's deeper than conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just how people rub up against each</v>

496
00:28:21.491 --> 00:28:22.324
<v Speaker 1>other when they're trying to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>how things are structured and so if you </v>

497
00:28:26.231 --> 00:28:27.850
<v Speaker 1>quit when they get upset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they think,</v>

498
00:28:27.851 --> 00:28:28.684
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well this thing isn't so important that </v>

499
00:28:30.751 --> 00:28:34.420
<v Speaker 1>it's worth this much upset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you continue to,</v>

500
00:28:34.421 --> 00:28:35.830
<v Speaker 1>well then they'll run away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

501
00:28:35.831 --> 00:28:36.664
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you have to do if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in any kind of relationship did </v>

502
00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:41.200
<v Speaker 1>you got to make a rule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is you can leave,</v>

503
00:28:41.201 --> 00:28:43.160
<v Speaker 1>but you got to come back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're not done with this.</v>

504
00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:46.930
<v Speaker 1>You can't run off</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's not.</v>

505
00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:47.500
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

506
00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:48.333
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's breaking the contract of the </v>

507
00:28:50.261 --> 00:28:52.960
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go to stay and hash it out.</v>

508
00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:55.170
<v Speaker 1>So now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

509
00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:58.120
<v Speaker 1>now I'm going to read you some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that Rogers</v>

510
00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:00.593
<v Speaker 2>talked about.</v>

511
00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:05.713
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so one of the things he talked about is </v>

512
00:29:06.361 --> 00:29:07.194
<v Speaker 1>this</v>

513
00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:08.763
<v Speaker 2>idea called</v>

514
00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:18.040
<v Speaker 1>unconditional positive regard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now</v>

515
00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:24.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's a very good phrase </v>
<v Speaker 1>because unconditional positive regard is</v>

516
00:29:24.611 --> 00:29:26.760
<v Speaker 1>one of those things that can be turned </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a new age,</v>

517
00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:29.050
<v Speaker 1>cliche two seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

518
00:29:29.051 --> 00:29:30.310
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter what you do will love.</v>

519
00:29:30.311 --> 00:29:31.144
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are lots of things you could do </v>

520
00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:35.090
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

521
00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:36.010
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is just,</v>

522
00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:39.220
<v Speaker 1>that's just not gonna Garner a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>love,</v>

523
00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:40.533
<v Speaker 1>so unconditional regard that it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's not an idea behind that </v>

524
00:29:43.931 --> 00:29:45.610
<v Speaker 1>because there really is an idea behind </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

525
00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:47.340
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

526
00:29:47.450 --> 00:29:49.240
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not all new agey.</v>

527
00:29:49.241 --> 00:29:51.730
<v Speaker 1>After Roger's formulated it and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>sounds like,</v>

528
00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:55.810
<v Speaker 1>well all you have to do is be </v>
<v Speaker 1>consistently positive towards the person</v>

529
00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:57.430
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll flourish.</v>

530
00:29:57.460 --> 00:29:59.110
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

531
00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:03.130
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have unconditional </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive regard for Hitler.</v>

532
00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:04.330
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

533
00:30:04.690 --> 00:30:05.523
<v Speaker 1>and not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a responsibility not to have </v>

534
00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:09.753
<v Speaker 1>unconditional positive regard for </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself or for other people because </v>

535
00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:16.870
<v Speaker 1>what you're trying to do is to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>things better.</v>

536
00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:19.660
<v Speaker 1>And so that means that the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>make things worse or bad,</v>

537
00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:21.280
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there's better,</v>

538
00:30:21.281 --> 00:30:22.114
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're in favor of better than </v>

539
00:30:24.641 --> 00:30:25.474
<v Speaker 1>you have to be not in favor of worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to untangle unconditional </v>

540
00:30:29.441 --> 00:30:31.570
<v Speaker 1>positive regard of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like I said,</v>

541
00:30:31.571 --> 00:30:34.960
<v Speaker 1>I think Roger used to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his word choice wasn't very good.</v>

542
00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:36.940
<v Speaker 1>Here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a different way of thinking about</v>

543
00:30:36.941 --> 00:30:37.774
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're in a relationship with </v>

544
00:30:39.161 --> 00:30:39.994
<v Speaker 1>someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this could even be a very short </v>

545
00:30:42.011 --> 00:30:42.844
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could be this sort of relationship </v>

546
00:30:43.721 --> 00:30:45.610
<v Speaker 1>that you have when you go to talk to </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone in a store.</v>

547
00:30:45.611 --> 00:30:47.350
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you get sophisticated about it,</v>

548
00:30:47.351 --> 00:30:49.780
<v Speaker 1>but let's assume it's a longer term </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>

549
00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:52.173
<v Speaker 1>you have to decide what if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to have that person's </v>

550
00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:58.540
<v Speaker 1>best interest in mind when you have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation,</v>

551
00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:02.620
<v Speaker 1>you got to have that as sort of the top </v>
<v Speaker 1>value in your value heart.</v>

552
00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:07.000
<v Speaker 1>But the reason we're talking is because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I want things to be better,</v>

553
00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:09.820
<v Speaker 1>not better for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

554
00:31:09.821 --> 00:31:11.350
<v Speaker 1>maybe better for me too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

555
00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:14.950
<v Speaker 1>but the better for me is a subordinate </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the better.</v>

556
00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:16.083
<v Speaker 1>The reason we're communicating is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we both want things to be </v>

557
00:31:18.191 --> 00:31:19.024
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we both aren't absolutely sure </v>

558
00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:24.130
<v Speaker 1>what it would mean for things to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

559
00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:25.013
<v Speaker 1>We've got to exchange information until </v>
<v Speaker 1>we figured that out and neither of us </v>

560
00:31:27.761 --> 00:31:28.594
<v Speaker 1>are sure about how we're going to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and so we have to exchange </v>

561
00:31:30.101 --> 00:31:32.470
<v Speaker 1>information until we figured out how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get there.</v>

562
00:31:32.471 --> 00:31:33.304
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the initial axiomatic </v>

563
00:31:36.341 --> 00:31:40.490
<v Speaker 1>precondition for a true conversation and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's unconditional positive regard.</v>

564
00:31:40.491 --> 00:31:41.324
<v Speaker 1>It's like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I regard the person I'm talking with as </v>

565
00:31:44.741 --> 00:31:45.574
<v Speaker 1>someone who could transform in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive direction and who's willing to </v>

566
00:31:50.591 --> 00:31:55.420
<v Speaker 1>attempt that and who will communicate to</v>
<v Speaker 1>that end even though they might screw up</v>

567
00:31:55.421 --> 00:31:56.254
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be things in the way </v>

568
00:31:57.221 --> 00:31:58.054
<v Speaker 1>and the sorts of things that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalysts talk about as resistance </v>

569
00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:04.320
<v Speaker 1>and then they're going to regard me the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same way and you know,</v>

570
00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:06.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm also going to make mistakes along </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way.</v>

571
00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:08.313
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

572
00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:13.670
<v Speaker 1>now Roger has pointed out that in order </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

573
00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:17.690
<v Speaker 1>to communicate with someone in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>manner,</v>

574
00:32:17.691 --> 00:32:20.660
<v Speaker 1>you had to be willing to put yourself in</v>
<v Speaker 1>their shoes essentially.</v>

575
00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:26.080
<v Speaker 1>And he said there you had to comprehend </v>
<v Speaker 1>the alternative phenomenal field.</v>

576
00:32:27.891 --> 00:32:28.730
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is okay.</v>

577
00:32:28.731 --> 00:32:29.360
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

578
00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:30.193
<v Speaker 1>I'm here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is my viewpoint coming out from </v>

579
00:32:31.851 --> 00:32:32.684
<v Speaker 1>this place and now you have a viewpoint </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're similar enough so that we </v>

580
00:32:36.441 --> 00:32:37.274
<v Speaker 1>can communicate about them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're different enough so that </v>

581
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:43.130
<v Speaker 1>they're not equivalent and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences are actually meaningful.</v>

582
00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:46.340
<v Speaker 1>So now I got a sort of pop myself out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>my framework,</v>

583
00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:47.563
<v Speaker 1>put myself in years and figure out where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're coming from and that's the goal </v>

584
00:32:51.771 --> 00:32:52.604
<v Speaker 1>of the conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So sometimes that can even help you </v>

585
00:32:54.921 --> 00:32:56.930
<v Speaker 1>figure out where you're coming from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

586
00:32:56.931 --> 00:32:57.651
<v Speaker 1>because you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

587
00:32:57.651 --> 00:33:00.140
<v Speaker 1>it sounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks to me like you're really angry,</v>

588
00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:02.060
<v Speaker 1>and the person will say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>

589
00:33:02.061 --> 00:33:03.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just A.</v>

590
00:33:03.770 --> 00:33:05.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

591
00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:06.140
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all ready.</v>

592
00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:07.790
<v Speaker 1>They look like they're going to bite you</v>
<v Speaker 1>and say,</v>

593
00:33:07.791 --> 00:33:08.624
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

594
00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:12.140
<v Speaker 1>It really looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you might feel also a little bit</v>

595
00:33:12.141 --> 00:33:15.500
<v Speaker 1>angry and there'll be angry about you </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying that of course,</v>

596
00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:20.060
<v Speaker 1>but it led to may also be that their </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions are so jumbled together in this</v>

597
00:33:20.061 --> 00:33:20.894
<v Speaker 1>sort of chaotic jumble that they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually know what it is that they're </v>

598
00:33:24.291 --> 00:33:29.291
<v Speaker 1>experiencing because it's this terrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>on articulated chaotic bodily state that</v>

599
00:33:32.290 --> 00:33:33.123
<v Speaker 1>is signaling something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that hasn't been articulated and so </v>

600
00:33:35.241 --> 00:33:39.020
<v Speaker 1>they're kind of a mess and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>careful observation,</v>

601
00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:41.490
<v Speaker 1>as long as they trust you and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>should trust you.</v>

602
00:33:41.491 --> 00:33:44.420
<v Speaker 1>If they know that you have their best </v>
<v Speaker 1>interests,</v>

603
00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:46.700
<v Speaker 1>whatever that is in mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least that you're trying,</v>

604
00:33:46.701 --> 00:33:47.534
<v Speaker 1>that then they can trust you and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can help them clarify what it is </v>

605
00:33:52.191 --> 00:33:54.500
<v Speaker 1>that they're feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what sort of coming up from the</v>

606
00:33:54.501 --> 00:33:59.501
<v Speaker 1>body and what that's associated with and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they'd like to do with it.</v>

607
00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:03.433
<v Speaker 1>Roger says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real communication occurs and the </v>

608
00:34:08.001 --> 00:34:12.380
<v Speaker 1>evaluative tendency avoided when we </v>
<v Speaker 1>listened with understanding.</v>

609
00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:16.490
<v Speaker 1>Now the evaluative tendency he's talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about is,</v>

610
00:34:17.870 --> 00:34:18.290
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let.</v>

611
00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:21.440
<v Speaker 1>Let's simplify this a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say I'm radically left waiting and</v>

612
00:34:21.441 --> 00:34:22.274
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking to someone who's radically </v>
<v Speaker 1>right way and we start talking about </v>

613
00:34:24.921 --> 00:34:26.970
<v Speaker 1>something like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

614
00:34:28.570 --> 00:34:32.030
<v Speaker 1>income distribution and the right wing </v>
<v Speaker 1>person says,</v>

615
00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:35.930
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say the left wing person says,</v>

616
00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:36.973
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's all these people at the bottom </v>

617
00:34:37.701 --> 00:34:38.534
<v Speaker 1>and they don't have a lot of money and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of the reason that they're there is </v>

618
00:34:41.031 --> 00:34:42.380
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

619
00:34:42.381 --> 00:34:43.790
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've encountered very,</v>

620
00:34:43.791 --> 00:34:47.300
<v Speaker 1>very harsh circumstances or maybe they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have an illness or something like that.</v>

621
00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:49.160
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

622
00:34:49.161 --> 00:34:52.670
<v Speaker 1>there's a real distribution of </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence and so lots of times people</v>

623
00:34:52.671 --> 00:34:53.504
<v Speaker 1>are at the bottom because they just </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have the cognitive resources to </v>

624
00:34:55.341 --> 00:34:57.800
<v Speaker 1>climb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the right winger goes rubbish,</v>

625
00:34:57.830 --> 00:34:58.580
<v Speaker 1>rubbish.</v>

626
00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:00.380
<v Speaker 1>The reason that they're at the bottom is</v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

627
00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:01.513
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't work hard enough and they </v>

628
00:35:03.171 --> 00:35:06.530
<v Speaker 1>don't take any care with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with their longterm thinking.</v>

629
00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:09.350
<v Speaker 1>And so the last one year says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

630
00:35:09.351 --> 00:35:11.240
<v Speaker 1>that's just prejudice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the rate when you're says,</v>

631
00:35:11.241 --> 00:35:12.920
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just a bleeding heart liberal,</v>

632
00:35:12.921 --> 00:35:14.870
<v Speaker 1>and poof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the end of the conversation.</v>

633
00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:19.460
<v Speaker 1>And that's the evaluative tendency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you just come away the same as</v>

634
00:35:19.461 --> 00:35:21.590
<v Speaker 1>you were when you entered the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>

635
00:35:21.591 --> 00:35:23.750
<v Speaker 1>There's be no exchange of information </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever.</v>

636
00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:24.753
<v Speaker 1>All there's been is a hardening of </v>
<v Speaker 1>prejudice and you can walk away feeling </v>

637
00:35:28.731 --> 00:35:29.564
<v Speaker 1>morally superior because you know you </v>
<v Speaker 1>demonstrated what a scum rat your </v>

638
00:35:33.351 --> 00:35:35.960
<v Speaker 1>opponent is and how morally upright you </v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

639
00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:40.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the value of a dependency.</v>

640
00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:43.020
<v Speaker 1>That's not a conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's gonna lead to progress.</v>

641
00:35:43.021 --> 00:35:45.810
<v Speaker 1>If anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to lead to increased feelings</v>

642
00:35:45.811 --> 00:35:50.100
<v Speaker 1>of prideful arrogance on your part </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know everything and on their</v>

643
00:35:50.101 --> 00:35:53.190
<v Speaker 1>part too and like increased </v>
<v Speaker 1>polarization.</v>

644
00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:56.960
<v Speaker 1>It's not a helpful way of communicating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

645
00:35:56.961 --> 00:35:57.794
<v Speaker 1>in this sort of thing as we'll see when </v>
<v Speaker 1>we moved into the more social and </v>

646
00:36:01.291 --> 00:36:05.880
<v Speaker 1>political consequences of a failure to </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate.</v>

647
00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:07.013
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's a microcosm of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes wrong in society when it really </v>

648
00:36:09.361 --> 00:36:10.970
<v Speaker 1>starts to fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

649
00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:11.813
<v Speaker 1>when the individuals within the society </v>
<v Speaker 1>who have different viewpoints can no </v>

650
00:36:14.101 --> 00:36:17.730
<v Speaker 1>longer communicate the whole society </v>
<v Speaker 1>shapes and trembles.</v>

651
00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:19.133
<v Speaker 1>And you can think about this from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>democratic perspective too because you </v>

652
00:36:21.121 --> 00:36:21.931
<v Speaker 1>might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

653
00:36:21.931 --> 00:36:24.840
<v Speaker 1>what's the purpose of elections?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

654
00:36:25.170 --> 00:36:27.570
<v Speaker 1>people who are aligned with a particular</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideology think,</v>

655
00:36:27.571 --> 00:36:28.404
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to win the election because our </v>

656
00:36:29.401 --> 00:36:33.660
<v Speaker 1>viewpoint is right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you might ask yourself,</v>

657
00:36:33.661 --> 00:36:36.690
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are there these other viewpoints and</v>

658
00:36:36.691 --> 00:36:37.524
<v Speaker 1>why do things go so bad when one </v>
<v Speaker 1>viewpoint dominate so heavily that </v>

659
00:36:39.970 --> 00:36:42.060
<v Speaker 1>everyone who had the other viewpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

660
00:36:42.330 --> 00:36:43.163
<v Speaker 1>gets shot.</v>

661
00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:44.003
<v Speaker 1>That seems like a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what exactly is going on in a </v>

662
00:36:47.401 --> 00:36:48.234
<v Speaker 1>democratic state and what's going on is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there is all these different </v>

663
00:36:51.571 --> 00:36:54.390
<v Speaker 1>viewpoints and a lot of them are </v>
<v Speaker 1>temperamentally informed.</v>

664
00:36:54.391 --> 00:36:55.620
<v Speaker 1>So we know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

665
00:36:55.621 --> 00:36:56.454
<v Speaker 1>that liberals are higher in openness and</v>
<v Speaker 1>lowering conscientiousness than </v>

666
00:37:02.281 --> 00:37:03.114
<v Speaker 1>conservatives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the conservatives are </v>

667
00:37:05.101 --> 00:37:08.310
<v Speaker 1>conscientious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not very creative and open,</v>

668
00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:11.370
<v Speaker 1>so they're good at running things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're really good at running.</v>

669
00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:14.220
<v Speaker 1>You're good at being managers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>administrators for example,</v>

670
00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:16.290
<v Speaker 1>but they're not very good at being </v>
<v Speaker 1>innovative.</v>

671
00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:19.020
<v Speaker 1>The liberals are good at being </v>
<v Speaker 1>innovative because they're open,</v>

672
00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:21.660
<v Speaker 1>but they're not very conscientious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like</v>

673
00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:24.023
<v Speaker 1>and that they have to be less </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientious in some ways if they're </v>

674
00:37:26.161 --> 00:37:26.994
<v Speaker 1>going to be creative because </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness can constrain </v>

675
00:37:28.531 --> 00:37:32.070
<v Speaker 1>creativity and so for the society to </v>
<v Speaker 1>work properly,</v>

676
00:37:32.071 --> 00:37:32.904
<v Speaker 1>the people with the liberal temperament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the conservative temperament has to </v>

677
00:37:35.371 --> 00:37:37.440
<v Speaker 1>interact with each other because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Liberals State Cup,</v>

678
00:37:37.441 --> 00:37:38.274
<v Speaker 1>all the new companies and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatives run them so and then in </v>

679
00:37:42.121 --> 00:37:43.620
<v Speaker 1>the political state per se.</v>

680
00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:44.453
<v Speaker 1>It's like conscientiousness is a virtue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although with if it's exaggerated too </v>

681
00:37:49.651 --> 00:37:51.270
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the orderly part,</v>

682
00:37:51.271 --> 00:37:52.104
<v Speaker 1>then it can become tyranny and openness </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a virtue to but you don't want every </v>

683
00:37:55.801 --> 00:37:56.634
<v Speaker 1>bloody thing changing every second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's got to be some constant </v>

684
00:38:02.610 --> 00:38:07.470
<v Speaker 1>negotiated peace between order and </v>
<v Speaker 1>innovation.</v>

685
00:38:07.530 --> 00:38:10.390
<v Speaker 1>And the way that that happens is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the two sides communicate.</v>

686
00:38:10.391 --> 00:38:12.660
<v Speaker 1>It isn't that one side wins and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other side wins.</v>

687
00:38:12.930 --> 00:38:13.763
<v Speaker 1>It's the dialogue stays open so that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>viewpoints can be represented properly </v>

688
00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:18.953
<v Speaker 1>and so that as the environment moves to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes maybe the environment is such </v>

689
00:38:21.631 --> 00:38:22.464
<v Speaker 1>that being conscientious is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>better and sometimes it's going to be </v>

690
00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:26.103
<v Speaker 1>environment is moved so that openness is</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be better because the </v>

691
00:38:28.411 --> 00:38:29.244
<v Speaker 1>environment moves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the conversation has to track those </v>

692
00:38:32.461 --> 00:38:33.294
<v Speaker 1>movements so the society stays healthy </v>
<v Speaker 1>across time and then the same thing </v>

693
00:38:36.731 --> 00:38:39.370
<v Speaker 1>applies in any kind of longterm </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>

694
00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:44.590
<v Speaker 1>It's like you marry someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you've got two brains and they don't</v>

695
00:38:44.591 --> 00:38:46.930
<v Speaker 1>work the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you want to have two braids or</v>

696
00:38:46.931 --> 00:38:47.764
<v Speaker 1>do you want to have one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the first question you're going </v>

697
00:38:49.301 --> 00:38:50.134
<v Speaker 1>to do a lot better with too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So and then so how do you optimize the </v>

698
00:38:53.801 --> 00:38:54.634
<v Speaker 1>functioning of the two braids?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While obviously they've caught a </v>

699
00:38:56.351 --> 00:38:57.184
<v Speaker 1>communicate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know there's going to be freedom of </v>

700
00:38:59.741 --> 00:39:02.140
<v Speaker 1>expression and there has to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>listening.</v>

701
00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:06.910
<v Speaker 1>So that's the evaluative tendency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is you're wrong.</v>

702
00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:09.580
<v Speaker 1>Before I even know what you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

703
00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:10.863
<v Speaker 1>at least I should know what the hell </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about before it decided </v>

704
00:39:12.881 --> 00:39:15.400
<v Speaker 1>if you're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so back to the poverty issue.</v>

705
00:39:15.401 --> 00:39:16.360
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

706
00:39:16.361 --> 00:39:18.730
<v Speaker 1>what predicts poverty?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

707
00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:19.983
<v Speaker 1>the sorts of things that the left way </v>
<v Speaker 1>your talks about that predicts problem </v>

708
00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:25.030
<v Speaker 1>poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to the sorts of things that the right</v>

709
00:39:25.031 --> 00:39:26.350
<v Speaker 1>way here talks about.</v>

710
00:39:26.350 --> 00:39:27.183
<v Speaker 1>So if you're really unconscientious and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes you kind of makes you the </v>

711
00:39:30.641 --> 00:39:34.750
<v Speaker 1>sort of person that will rely on others </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do the work.</v>

712
00:39:34.930 --> 00:39:37.600
<v Speaker 1>If you're unconscientious you're much </v>
<v Speaker 1>more likely to be poor.</v>

713
00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:39.393
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a real social policy </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem too because you have this </v>

714
00:39:42.101 --> 00:39:47.020
<v Speaker 1>horrible problem where you have to sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>out what's causing the poverty,</v>

715
00:39:47.650 --> 00:39:48.483
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and who's taking advantage of the </v>

716
00:39:50.801 --> 00:39:53.770
<v Speaker 1>attempts to alleviate it as well as </v>
<v Speaker 1>figuring out.</v>

717
00:39:54.270 --> 00:39:55.103
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's more of an individual </v>

718
00:39:56.201 --> 00:39:57.034
<v Speaker 1>temperament problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what the conservatives they're </v>

719
00:39:58.271 --> 00:40:00.460
<v Speaker 1>concerned about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you also have to figure out how</v>

720
00:40:00.461 --> 00:40:01.294
<v Speaker 1>to address it on a social level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which of course the conservatives don't </v>

721
00:40:03.101 --> 00:40:03.934
<v Speaker 1>like to think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not like either side has </v>

722
00:40:06.011 --> 00:40:08.350
<v Speaker 1>nothing to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's information in both.</v>

723
00:40:08.351 --> 00:40:11.440
<v Speaker 1>Those perspectives is problematic though</v>
<v Speaker 1>because when you put them together,</v>

724
00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:15.280
<v Speaker 1>the phenomenon becomes paradoxical and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's very difficult to come up with</v>

725
00:40:15.281 --> 00:40:16.030
<v Speaker 1>a solution.</v>

726
00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:16.863
<v Speaker 1>It challenges your cognitive resources </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what the conservative and the </v>

727
00:40:19.471 --> 00:40:22.060
<v Speaker 1>liberal want to do is just simplify it </v>
<v Speaker 1>down to one explanation.</v>

728
00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:24.700
<v Speaker 1>It's sociological.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the liberal,</v>

729
00:40:24.910 --> 00:40:27.070
<v Speaker 1>it's temperamental.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the conservative,</v>

730
00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:29.710
<v Speaker 1>and so then they have one answer to how </v>
<v Speaker 1>it can be fixed.</v>

731
00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:32.500
<v Speaker 1>We should fix society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the liberal.</v>

732
00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:35.260
<v Speaker 1>Those people should just get their act </v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

733
00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:36.670
<v Speaker 1>That's the conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

734
00:40:36.671 --> 00:40:38.170
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well fair enough.</v>

735
00:40:38.171 --> 00:40:41.480
<v Speaker 1>Except probably the problem is </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated to now,</v>

736
00:40:41.481 --> 00:40:42.314
<v Speaker 1>so there's more than one solution </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary since it's not even ad </v>

737
00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:47.090
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

738
00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:53.040
<v Speaker 1>Poverty is not our problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Poverty is like 10,000 problems and some</v>

739
00:40:53.441 --> 00:40:55.300
<v Speaker 1>of them aren't even associated with each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

740
00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:56.553
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's the poverty that's a </v>

741
00:40:57.041 --> 00:41:00.310
<v Speaker 1>consequence of alcoholism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not the same poverty.</v>

742
00:41:00.311 --> 00:41:01.144
<v Speaker 1>That's a consequence of say very low </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence and that's a completely </v>

743
00:41:04.391 --> 00:41:05.224
<v Speaker 1>different poverty than the non </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientious poverty or the abuse </v>

744
00:41:08.141 --> 00:41:08.974
<v Speaker 1>poverty or.</v>

745
00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:13.060
<v Speaker 1>And there's no reason to assume </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever that those should be amenable</v>

746
00:41:13.061 --> 00:41:13.894
<v Speaker 1>to the same solutions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Real communication occurs and the </v>

747
00:41:18.101 --> 00:41:21.550
<v Speaker 1>evaluative tendency avoided when we </v>
<v Speaker 1>listen with understanding.</v>

748
00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:23.703
<v Speaker 1>Understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an interesting word because you </v>

749
00:41:25.691 --> 00:41:26.471
<v Speaker 1>might ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

750
00:41:26.471 --> 00:41:31.471
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean when you understand and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got this sort of physical aspect to</v>

751
00:41:34.041 --> 00:41:34.401
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

752
00:41:34.401 --> 00:41:35.234
<v Speaker 1>That's the stand and then there's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>underpart which sort of implies that to </v>

753
00:41:39.321 --> 00:41:40.154
<v Speaker 1>understand something is to be under it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and standing and so partly what happens </v>

754
00:41:44.811 --> 00:41:45.644
<v Speaker 1>is if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I can listen to you with </v>

755
00:41:47.061 --> 00:41:47.894
<v Speaker 1>understanding what that means is that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>get a clear enough picture of what you </v>

756
00:41:50.601 --> 00:41:53.450
<v Speaker 1>want so that I could change the way that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am,</v>

757
00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:54.343
<v Speaker 1>that I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the way I look at things like the </v>

758
00:41:56.841 --> 00:41:59.390
<v Speaker 1>perceptual scheme through which I view </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>

759
00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:02.450
<v Speaker 1>but also my actions and if I can extract</v>
<v Speaker 1>it from you,</v>

760
00:42:02.451 --> 00:42:03.284
<v Speaker 1>then I understand I would be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>take what you told me and change myself </v>

761
00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:08.803
<v Speaker 1>if I felt that was appropriate or maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>it would just happen automatically </v>

762
00:42:11.631 --> 00:42:13.680
<v Speaker 1>because now I have the deep </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding of you.</v>

763
00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:15.620
<v Speaker 1>People are afraid of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

764
00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:16.483
<v Speaker 1>Because of say you've got yourself all </v>
<v Speaker 1>hemmed in with some ideology and you're </v>

765
00:42:20.031 --> 00:42:20.864
<v Speaker 1>feeling pretty secure about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you listen to some dim who's </v>

766
00:42:24.521 --> 00:42:25.354
<v Speaker 1>got completely the opposite perspective </v>
<v Speaker 1>from you and you listen hard and all of </v>

767
00:42:28.671 --> 00:42:30.590
<v Speaker 1>a sudden you've got cracks in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>

768
00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:32.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you have to think,</v>

769
00:42:32.361 --> 00:42:34.790
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe things are more complicated than I</v>

770
00:42:34.791 --> 00:42:35.624
<v Speaker 1>thought they were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything isn't all tied together in </v>

771
00:42:37.311 --> 00:42:39.740
<v Speaker 1>this neat little package that can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>unsettling.</v>

772
00:42:40.250 --> 00:42:41.083
<v Speaker 1>It's unsettling fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're listening to someone and </v>

773
00:42:43.251 --> 00:42:46.190
<v Speaker 1>you're really listening and you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>being unsettled,</v>

774
00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:50.000
<v Speaker 1>the probability is pretty high either </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're not listening or that you're</v>

775
00:42:50.001 --> 00:42:50.834
<v Speaker 1>not talking about anything of real </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence because if it's important </v>

776
00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:56.750
<v Speaker 1>and you're listening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna Shift.</v>

777
00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:58.310
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's this,</v>

778
00:42:58.460 --> 00:42:59.293
<v Speaker 1>it's going to set you into that at least</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit into that state of chaos </v>

779
00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:04.970
<v Speaker 1>and what you're doing then just so you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

780
00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:08.750
<v Speaker 1>is that instead of identifying with who </v>
<v Speaker 1>you were,</v>

781
00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:11.150
<v Speaker 1>which is the person that you were at </v>
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

782
00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:11.993
<v Speaker 1>the conversation you're identifying with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the person you could be as you move </v>

783
00:43:16.311 --> 00:43:19.760
<v Speaker 1>through the conversation and that's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>way better thing to identify with,</v>

784
00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:21.860
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>know you to identify with your beliefs.</v>

785
00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:22.693
<v Speaker 1>This is a phd and idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you've been identified with your </v>

786
00:43:24.651 --> 00:43:25.484
<v Speaker 1>beliefs or you going to identify with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the process that allows you to generate </v>

787
00:43:29.691 --> 00:43:30.524
<v Speaker 1>beliefs and often those things are in </v>
<v Speaker 1>contradiction because if you identify </v>

788
00:43:34.611 --> 00:43:36.710
<v Speaker 1>with the process that allows you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>change your beliefs,</v>

789
00:43:36.711 --> 00:43:38.420
<v Speaker 1>then you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

790
00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:41.750
<v Speaker 1>you're assaulting your beliefs even </v>
<v Speaker 1>though you might be correcting them,</v>

791
00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:42.920
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

792
00:43:43.570 --> 00:43:44.403
<v Speaker 1>it's demanding to do that because you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>reconfiguring your physiology and </v>

793
00:43:50.211 --> 00:43:53.300
<v Speaker 1>there's an intermediary period of </v>
<v Speaker 1>uncertainty that goes along with that.</v>

794
00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:55.310
<v Speaker 1>What if they're right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

795
00:43:55.311 --> 00:43:56.180
<v Speaker 1>that month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like,</v>

796
00:43:56.181 --> 00:43:57.260
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then what</v>

797
00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:02.660
<v Speaker 1>we'll communication occurs in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>evaluative tenancy avoidance.</v>

798
00:44:02.661 --> 00:44:05.240
<v Speaker 1>When we listened with understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does this mean?</v>

799
00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:07.123
<v Speaker 1>It means to see the expressed idea and </v>
<v Speaker 1>attitude from the other person's point </v>

800
00:44:10.581 --> 00:44:15.410
<v Speaker 1>of view to sense how it feels to him to </v>
<v Speaker 1>achieve his frame of reference in regard</v>

801
00:44:15.411 --> 00:44:16.730
<v Speaker 1>to the thing he is talking about.</v>

802
00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:17.833
<v Speaker 1>So there's also rogers is very </v>
<v Speaker 1>emphasized is very much the idea of </v>

803
00:44:22.041 --> 00:44:24.950
<v Speaker 1>embodiment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can listen to someone,</v>

804
00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:28.850
<v Speaker 1>you can listen to their arguments with </v>
<v Speaker 1>your mind.</v>

805
00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:30.433
<v Speaker 1>It's a very logical process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's of a rational and logical process </v>

806
00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:35.160
<v Speaker 1>and in some sense that's what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>taught to do.</v>

807
00:44:35.161 --> 00:44:35.994
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you debate and the idea there is </v>

808
00:44:38.131 --> 00:44:38.964
<v Speaker 1>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the argument is it's a cognitive </v>

809
00:44:41.971 --> 00:44:46.470
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon and that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the logic is structured in a logical way</v>

810
00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:47.543
<v Speaker 1>and that the way that the argument is </v>
<v Speaker 1>settled by is by the exchange of </v>

811
00:44:51.061 --> 00:44:54.940
<v Speaker 1>information and the relative coherence </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the two perspective.</v>

812
00:44:54.941 --> 00:44:55.774
<v Speaker 1>It's a very rationalistic perspective </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's very useful to be able to </v>

813
00:44:59.431 --> 00:45:00.720
<v Speaker 1>debate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get me wrong and,</v>

814
00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:01.613
<v Speaker 1>and have your mind organized so that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could put forward a logical arguments </v>

815
00:45:04.441 --> 00:45:08.100
<v Speaker 1>like that's why you're in university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to learn how to do that,</v>

816
00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:09.173
<v Speaker 1>believe it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and but it's not the same sort of thing </v>

817
00:45:12.031 --> 00:45:12.864
<v Speaker 1>that rogers is after because when Rogers</v>
<v Speaker 1>talks about the interactions between </v>

818
00:45:16.201 --> 00:45:17.250
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's embodied.</v>

819
00:45:17.250 --> 00:45:19.800
<v Speaker 1>So like if I'm really watching you when </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking to you,</v>

820
00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:21.053
<v Speaker 1>paying attention to your face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be like expressing </v>

821
00:45:23.971 --> 00:45:27.030
<v Speaker 1>emotions with your face screen because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what it does,</v>

822
00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:27.873
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your face expresses emotion so that </v>

823
00:45:29.431 --> 00:45:34.431
<v Speaker 1>other people can infer what it is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're up to even more than you know.</v>

824
00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:35.573
<v Speaker 1>Because if you knew that you could just </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell them you wouldn't even need </v>

825
00:45:37.141 --> 00:45:39.540
<v Speaker 1>emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what the hell do you know about what</v>

826
00:45:39.541 --> 00:45:40.374
<v Speaker 1>you want?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why you're having a conversation </v>

827
00:45:41.701 --> 00:45:42.534
<v Speaker 1>with someone to figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're watching them like mad and </v>

828
00:45:45.211 --> 00:45:46.044
<v Speaker 1>you're watching their posture and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're mirroring them and you can do </v>

829
00:45:48.271 --> 00:45:49.104
<v Speaker 1>that consciously to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's probably better if you just do </v>

830
00:45:51.151 --> 00:45:54.240
<v Speaker 1>it unconsciously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when you're mirroring them with</v>

831
00:45:54.241 --> 00:45:55.074
<v Speaker 1>your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can feel what they're feeling </v>

832
00:45:56.491 --> 00:45:57.324
<v Speaker 1>and then you can start to draw </v>
<v Speaker 1>inferences about what it is that they </v>

833
00:45:59.641 --> 00:45:59.970
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>

834
00:45:59.970 --> 00:46:00.803
<v Speaker 1>By noticing how you're feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is often one of the things that </v>

835
00:46:03.271 --> 00:46:04.104
<v Speaker 1>will stop people dead in the source of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation because the other person </v>

836
00:46:06.631 --> 00:46:07.464
<v Speaker 1>will get upset and then you'll watch </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and then that'll make you feel </v>

837
00:46:10.111 --> 00:46:10.980
<v Speaker 1>upset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you go,</v>

838
00:46:11.070 --> 00:46:11.903
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't deal with this anymore because </v>

839
00:46:12.451 --> 00:46:14.040
<v Speaker 1>it's too upsetting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

840
00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:15.053
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe the fact that it's upsetting is </v>

841
00:46:18.151 --> 00:46:20.760
<v Speaker 1>actually an indication that you really </v>
<v Speaker 1>should deal with it.</v>

842
00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:23.820
<v Speaker 1>You know you can't just run away if it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>upsetting,</v>

843
00:46:24.330 --> 00:46:26.970
<v Speaker 1>upsetting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something's being flipped over.</v>

844
00:46:26.971 --> 00:46:27.804
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's upsetting when you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to fail out just because you're </v>

845
00:46:30.751 --> 00:46:33.450
<v Speaker 1>upset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you no clue in.</v>

846
00:46:33.810 --> 00:46:34.643
<v Speaker 1>That's not the time to quit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want to maybe detach a bit from your </v>

847
00:46:37.201 --> 00:46:38.910
<v Speaker 1>emotion so you don't get drowned in </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

848
00:46:39.210 --> 00:46:41.310
<v Speaker 1>so you can use them in an informative </v>
<v Speaker 1>manner,</v>

849
00:46:41.311 --> 00:46:42.450
<v Speaker 1>but you don't want to stop.</v>

850
00:46:42.450 --> 00:46:44.460
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got things going then</v>

851
00:46:48.340 --> 00:46:51.150
<v Speaker 1>stayed in so briefly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This may sound absurdly simple.</v>

852
00:46:51.210 --> 00:46:52.800
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't state it so briefly,</v>

853
00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:53.993
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an approach which we have found </v>

854
00:46:55.771 --> 00:46:58.590
<v Speaker 1>extremely potent in the field of </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapy.</v>

855
00:46:59.210 --> 00:47:00.043
<v Speaker 1>It is the most effective agent we know </v>
<v Speaker 1>for altering the basic personality </v>

856
00:47:03.451 --> 00:47:08.010
<v Speaker 1>structure of an individual and improving</v>
<v Speaker 1>his relationships and his communications</v>

857
00:47:08.011 --> 00:47:10.920
<v Speaker 1>with others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I can listen to what he can tell me,</v>

858
00:47:12.030 --> 00:47:14.970
<v Speaker 1>if I can understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how it seems to him,</v>

859
00:47:16.350 --> 00:47:18.750
<v Speaker 1>if I can see it's personal meaning for </v>
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>

860
00:47:20.430 --> 00:47:23.010
<v Speaker 1>if I can sense the emotional flavor </v>
<v Speaker 1>which it has for him,</v>

861
00:47:23.011 --> 00:47:26.030
<v Speaker 1>then I will be releasing potent forces </v>
<v Speaker 1>of change in him.</v>

862
00:47:26.490 --> 00:47:27.323
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can imagine like your brain is </v>

863
00:47:29.441 --> 00:47:32.440
<v Speaker 1>always trying to figure things out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

864
00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:34.510
<v Speaker 1>let's extend that a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just your brain,</v>

865
00:47:34.511 --> 00:47:38.170
<v Speaker 1>it's your cycle physiology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's your whole body is trying to figure</v>

866
00:47:38.171 --> 00:47:38.770
<v Speaker 1>things out.</v>

867
00:47:38.770 --> 00:47:39.603
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can't just think about it as a </v>

868
00:47:41.350 --> 00:47:44.320
<v Speaker 1>logical and mental process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like your emotions are there.</v>

869
00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:47.380
<v Speaker 1>Evaluative processes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to give you information,</v>

870
00:47:47.381 --> 00:47:49.750
<v Speaker 1>but they're not very articulate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

871
00:47:49.751 --> 00:47:52.030
<v Speaker 1>it's like you come home and you're all </v>
<v Speaker 1>angry and you're touching.</v>

872
00:47:52.330 --> 00:47:54.010
<v Speaker 1>Your partner says something that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

873
00:47:54.011 --> 00:47:56.860
<v Speaker 1>pretty mundane and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just explode.</v>

874
00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:58.150
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

875
00:47:58.240 --> 00:47:59.890
<v Speaker 1>they say to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are you like that?</v>

876
00:47:59.891 --> 00:48:00.431
<v Speaker 1>And they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

877
00:48:00.431 --> 00:48:03.010
<v Speaker 1>I hate it when your boots are in the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the door.</v>

878
00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:03.971
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

879
00:48:03.971 --> 00:48:06.550
<v Speaker 1>that's why you're having to fit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it because the Buddhists are.</v>

880
00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:07.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're always there.</v>

881
00:48:08.010 --> 00:48:08.843
<v Speaker 1>It's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be sure that there's a big mess </v>

882
00:48:11.831 --> 00:48:12.664
<v Speaker 1>underneath that and it's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard to approach that person because </v>

883
00:48:15.370 --> 00:48:17.620
<v Speaker 1>angry people are also kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

884
00:48:17.621 --> 00:48:19.890
<v Speaker 1>they're kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

885
00:48:19.950 --> 00:48:20.783
<v Speaker 1>they're irritable for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they also have this kind of shadow </v>

886
00:48:22.721 --> 00:48:24.080
<v Speaker 1>on them that is touching.</v>

887
00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:26.080
<v Speaker 1>They're touchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you touched them,</v>

888
00:48:26.081 --> 00:48:27.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll get irritated at you.</v>

889
00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:31.120
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you mirror that,</v>

890
00:48:31.121 --> 00:48:32.560
<v Speaker 1>if you're listening to them and watching</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

891
00:48:32.561 --> 00:48:33.394
<v Speaker 1>then they can start to figure out that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're angry and that maybe there are </v>

892
00:48:35.031 --> 00:48:37.240
<v Speaker 1>two or more angry than the situation </v>
<v Speaker 1>demands.</v>

893
00:48:37.241 --> 00:48:39.730
<v Speaker 1>And if you listen to them be angry for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>while,</v>

894
00:48:39.731 --> 00:48:40.960
<v Speaker 1>which is very annoying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

895
00:48:40.961 --> 00:48:44.050
<v Speaker 1>Because maybe there'll be angry at you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then maybe they'll calm down and they'll</v>

896
00:48:44.051 --> 00:48:44.884
<v Speaker 1>start to</v>
<v Speaker 1>differentiate that emotion into </v>

897
00:48:48.970 --> 00:48:50.740
<v Speaker 1>articulated statements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

898
00:48:50.741 --> 00:48:52.450
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a really terrible day at work.</v>

899
00:48:53.350 --> 00:48:54.183
<v Speaker 1>Well what was so terrible about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it'll tell you a little story and </v>

900
00:48:57.400 --> 00:48:57.971
<v Speaker 1>then they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

901
00:48:57.971 --> 00:48:58.804
<v Speaker 1>that's happening all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you asked them about that and </v>

902
00:49:00.911 --> 00:49:01.511
<v Speaker 1>then they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

903
00:49:01.511 --> 00:49:02.344
<v Speaker 1>my boss is unreasonable in his demands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then you ask them about that and </v>

904
00:49:05.530 --> 00:49:06.363
<v Speaker 1>you find out that the person either has </v>
<v Speaker 1>a pilot for a loss because sometimes </v>

905
00:49:10.211 --> 00:49:10.960
<v Speaker 1>that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

906
00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:12.460
<v Speaker 1>A real bully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which when,</v>

907
00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:13.353
<v Speaker 1>and then the answer to why they're mad </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the shoes is because they should </v>

908
00:49:15.641 --> 00:49:17.740
<v Speaker 1>change jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

909
00:49:17.741 --> 00:49:20.020
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe you'll find out that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

910
00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:22.570
<v Speaker 1>they have no idea how to say no to their</v>
<v Speaker 1>boss.</v>

911
00:49:22.810 --> 00:49:25.540
<v Speaker 1>They just say yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter what he or she says,</v>

912
00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:26.583
<v Speaker 1>and that needs for too agreeable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe you have to figure out </v>

913
00:49:28.931 --> 00:49:29.764
<v Speaker 1>how they can learn how to say no and how</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to sort of check with their </v>

914
00:49:32.801 --> 00:49:35.440
<v Speaker 1>resentment to figure out when they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>being taken advantage of.</v>

915
00:49:35.441 --> 00:49:36.910
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>

916
00:49:36.911 --> 00:49:40.690
<v Speaker 1>very complicated and it's no wonder </v>
<v Speaker 1>people want to avoid it,</v>

917
00:49:41.530 --> 00:49:43.570
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's another sort of truism.</v>

918
00:49:43.571 --> 00:49:48.130
<v Speaker 1>If someone's overreacting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well they're not reacting to that thing.</v>

919
00:49:48.131 --> 00:49:51.100
<v Speaker 1>They're reacting to that thing plus a </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole bunch of things that are unrelated</v>

920
00:49:51.101 --> 00:49:51.934
<v Speaker 1>to that thing sorted and they don't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it is and so then if you listen to </v>

921
00:49:56.321 --> 00:49:57.154
<v Speaker 1>them and they talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're actually thinking because what </v>

922
00:50:00.791 --> 00:50:04.480
<v Speaker 1>you might think when you're talking is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you think and then you say what you</v>

923
00:50:04.481 --> 00:50:06.580
<v Speaker 1>think and so you don't have to park.</v>

924
00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:08.710
<v Speaker 1>You could just think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that isn't right.</v>

925
00:50:08.740 --> 00:50:11.950
<v Speaker 1>Most people don't really think like </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not.</v>

926
00:50:13.350 --> 00:50:17.890
<v Speaker 1>They don't sit down and meditate and </v>
<v Speaker 1>think logically through a whole sequence</v>

927
00:50:17.891 --> 00:50:18.724
<v Speaker 1>of problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thought sort of appear in their </v>

928
00:50:20.261 --> 00:50:21.094
<v Speaker 1>heads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

929
00:50:21.100 --> 00:50:25.600
<v Speaker 1>spontaneously sort of like a reverie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not really.</v>

930
00:50:26.710 --> 00:50:28.880
<v Speaker 1>They're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

931
00:50:28.881 --> 00:50:30.980
<v Speaker 1>they don't have that kind of command of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the language.</v>

932
00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:32.263
<v Speaker 1>And so then when they're talking to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're actually thinking they're </v>

933
00:50:35.571 --> 00:50:36.404
<v Speaker 1>thinking out loud and for all we know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe thinking is more effective when </v>

934
00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:40.753
<v Speaker 1>you say it out loud because my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'm wired up so that my brain </v>

935
00:50:44.811 --> 00:50:45.644
<v Speaker 1>assumes that if I'm willing to tell it </v>
<v Speaker 1>to you to make the troubling that it's </v>

936
00:50:48.741 --> 00:50:51.560
<v Speaker 1>more true than those things I'd like to </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep to myself.</v>

937
00:50:51.980 --> 00:50:52.813
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things you're doing in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a psychotherapeutic session is you're </v>

938
00:50:55.431 --> 00:50:57.110
<v Speaker 1>just letting the person talk</v>

939
00:50:58.480 --> 00:50:59.980
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had clients,</v>

940
00:51:00.190 --> 00:51:01.023
<v Speaker 1>they don't want me to do anything for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hour that I'm with them except shut </v>

941
00:51:03.641 --> 00:51:08.620
<v Speaker 1>up and listen and maybe now and then I </v>
<v Speaker 1>can just clarify something.</v>

942
00:51:08.621 --> 00:51:10.750
<v Speaker 1>I have one client in particular who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>very isolated,</v>

943
00:51:10.751 --> 00:51:11.584
<v Speaker 1>socially isolated and this person has </v>
<v Speaker 1>come to see me for a long time and they </v>

944
00:51:15.431 --> 00:51:16.264
<v Speaker 1>just want this person comes every two </v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks and what they want to do is talk </v>

945
00:51:19.391 --> 00:51:22.230
<v Speaker 1>about the last two weeks and they won't </v>
<v Speaker 1>be listened.</v>

946
00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:24.550
<v Speaker 1>And so I have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to be engaged,</v>

947
00:51:24.551 --> 00:51:25.570
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm listening.</v>

948
00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:28.270
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a communicative process.</v>

949
00:51:28.290 --> 00:51:28.961
<v Speaker 1>This snake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

950
00:51:28.961 --> 00:51:30.950
<v Speaker 1>Because your face is changing and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>nodding.</v>

951
00:51:31.140 --> 00:51:31.973
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're reacting so you're in the </v>

952
00:51:33.161 --> 00:51:33.994
<v Speaker 1>communication,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this person just wants to talk and </v>

953
00:51:36.911 --> 00:51:39.190
<v Speaker 1>then they sort themselves out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

954
00:51:39.191 --> 00:51:40.024
<v Speaker 1>Figure out what it is they're upset </v>
<v Speaker 1>about and then that's good and they can </v>

955
00:51:42.221 --> 00:51:44.800
<v Speaker 1>go off and operate in the world for two </v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks.</v>

956
00:51:45.070 --> 00:51:46.630
<v Speaker 1>That's all just listening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

957
00:51:46.660 --> 00:51:47.493
<v Speaker 1>just listening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listening is hard and people aren't </v>

958
00:51:49.901 --> 00:51:50.830
<v Speaker 1>taught how to do it.</v>

959
00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:57.830
<v Speaker 1>If I can listen to what he can tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I can understand how it seems to him,</v>

960
00:51:58.160 --> 00:51:58.993
<v Speaker 1>if I could sense it's personal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning that I will be releasing potent </v>

961
00:52:01.401 --> 00:52:02.234
<v Speaker 1>forces of change in him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I can really understand how he hates </v>

962
00:52:06.021 --> 00:52:06.854
<v Speaker 1>his father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that could be a conversation that </v>

963
00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:13.790
<v Speaker 1>go on for months or hates the university</v>
<v Speaker 1>or hates communists.</v>

964
00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:19.030
<v Speaker 1>If I can catch the flavor of the sphere </v>
<v Speaker 1>of insanity or a sphere of atom bombs or</v>

965
00:52:19.100 --> 00:52:19.933
<v Speaker 1>Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could tell that this is a little </v>

966
00:52:21.051 --> 00:52:21.884
<v Speaker 1>old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will be of the greatest help to him </v>

967
00:52:23.811 --> 00:52:24.644
<v Speaker 1>and altering those very hatreds and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fears and in establishing realistic and </v>

968
00:52:27.621 --> 00:52:28.454
<v Speaker 1>harmonious relationships with the very </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and situations towards which he </v>

969
00:52:32.061 --> 00:52:34.940
<v Speaker 1>has felt hatred and fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

970
00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:38.380
<v Speaker 1>let's say someone comes into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>therapeutic session,</v>

971
00:52:38.381 --> 00:52:38.961
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Geez,</v>

972
00:52:38.961 --> 00:52:39.794
<v Speaker 1>I just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just having a conversation by for </v>

973
00:52:41.180 --> 00:52:41.870
<v Speaker 1>my father.</v>

974
00:52:41.870 --> 00:52:44.360
<v Speaker 1>I just hate my father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time I talked to him,</v>

975
00:52:44.361 --> 00:52:47.060
<v Speaker 1>it just makes me angry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

976
00:52:47.061 --> 00:52:50.000
<v Speaker 1>that's all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a low resolution representations,</v>

977
00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:50.863
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like one pixel farther equals </v>

978
00:52:52.221 --> 00:52:53.054
<v Speaker 1>anger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not differentiated and that's a </v>

979
00:52:55.971 --> 00:53:00.590
<v Speaker 1>problem because their body's responding </v>
<v Speaker 1>as if this person needs to be taken out.</v>

980
00:53:00.620 --> 00:53:01.453
<v Speaker 1>Like you might take out a prey object or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that or destroy it </v>

981
00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:05.510
<v Speaker 1>because that's where danger is light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

982
00:53:05.511 --> 00:53:09.260
<v Speaker 1>Anger sort of like you're an object to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be destroyed and it's.</v>

983
00:53:09.620 --> 00:53:10.453
<v Speaker 1>There's truth in that because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be elicited by the farther </v>

984
00:53:14.091 --> 00:53:16.580
<v Speaker 1>unless there was something necessity for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the anger,</v>

985
00:53:16.581 --> 00:53:20.360
<v Speaker 1>but it's so generalized global,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not helpful.</v>

986
00:53:20.570 --> 00:53:21.141
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

987
00:53:21.141 --> 00:53:23.030
<v Speaker 1>let's talk about your father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

988
00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:24.410
<v Speaker 1>how would you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

989
00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:25.333
<v Speaker 1>what did he do recently to upset you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you listen and you don't give </v>

990
00:53:27.781 --> 00:53:28.614
<v Speaker 1>the person advice about what they should</v>
<v Speaker 1>have done because what the hell do you </v>

991
00:53:30.931 --> 00:53:32.190
<v Speaker 1>know about what they should have done?</v>

992
00:53:32.410 --> 00:53:33.243
<v Speaker 1>You might have to listen for 50 hours </v>
<v Speaker 1>before you could offer a helpful </v>

993
00:53:36.571 --> 00:53:38.730
<v Speaker 1>suggestion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even then it probably won't work.</v>

994
00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:41.910
<v Speaker 1>So you listen and then they tell you </v>
<v Speaker 1>some stories about,</v>

995
00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:44.430
<v Speaker 1>this is almost like the Friday and </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalytic approach.</v>

996
00:53:44.431 --> 00:53:45.264
<v Speaker 1>They tell you some stories about what </v>
<v Speaker 1>their father was like when they're in </v>

997
00:53:46.831 --> 00:53:47.664
<v Speaker 1>their childhood and then a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that pop up in memory and you </v>

998
00:53:51.451 --> 00:53:52.920
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they start laying out the story,</v>

999
00:53:52.921 --> 00:53:53.754
<v Speaker 1>it's like their land cards out on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>table and they just lay out all these </v>

1000
00:53:56.221 --> 00:53:57.054
<v Speaker 1>cards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like a thousand cards and </v>

1001
00:53:58.441 --> 00:54:00.330
<v Speaker 1>they're all representations of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>father.</v>

1002
00:54:00.660 --> 00:54:03.030
<v Speaker 1>And then they started to exhaust </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

1003
00:54:03.031 --> 00:54:05.400
<v Speaker 1>They're out of angry stories about their</v>
<v Speaker 1>father.</v>

1004
00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:06.840
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1005
00:54:06.841 --> 00:54:09.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there wasn't all bad.</v>

1006
00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:13.320
<v Speaker 1>Then they started laying out some things</v>
<v Speaker 1>about him that,</v>

1007
00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:15.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he drank all the time,</v>

1008
00:54:15.301 --> 00:54:15.960
<v Speaker 1>but he was really.</v>

1009
00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:19.800
<v Speaker 1>He always took care of us and he wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't an angry drunk,</v>

1010
00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:21.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1011
00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:24.490
<v Speaker 1>and he stayed with my mother and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1012
00:54:24.540 --> 00:54:27.930
<v Speaker 1>so what's happening now is the picture </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the father's getting differentiated,</v>

1013
00:54:27.990 --> 00:54:30.690
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just one pixel,</v>

1014
00:54:30.930 --> 00:54:33.030
<v Speaker 1>it's differentiated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you might say,</v>

1015
00:54:33.031 --> 00:54:34.560
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1016
00:54:34.561 --> 00:54:37.800
<v Speaker 1>here's all these angry things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of them are still relevant?</v>

1017
00:54:37.980 --> 00:54:41.130
<v Speaker 1>Like how many of those do you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with and the person will say think,</v>

1018
00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:42.230
<v Speaker 1>well these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1019
00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:47.960
<v Speaker 1>80 percent of these anger things or dad </v>
<v Speaker 1>there in the past and you know,</v>

1020
00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:49.493
<v Speaker 1>70 percent of these good things weren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>good enough to make up for the rest of </v>

1021
00:54:52.801 --> 00:54:53.634
<v Speaker 1>this mess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you get a smaller pile of </v>

1022
00:54:55.051 --> 00:54:55.884
<v Speaker 1>specific things and then maybe you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>start figuring out ways that or the </v>

1023
00:54:59.191 --> 00:55:00.024
<v Speaker 1>person can start figuring out ways that </v>
<v Speaker 1>those might be addressed moment to </v>

1024
00:55:02.251 --> 00:55:05.580
<v Speaker 1>moment in new conversations like it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>strategic plan.</v>

1025
00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:09.720
<v Speaker 1>What's the situation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What exactly is going on here?</v>

1026
00:55:09.721 --> 00:55:10.554
<v Speaker 1>Lay it out and the emotions are a great </v>
<v Speaker 1>guide to that because the first thing </v>

1027
00:55:13.861 --> 00:55:16.980
<v Speaker 1>you want to do is everything that makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>you emotional.</v>

1028
00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:20.460
<v Speaker 1>Those are the things that aren't dealt </v>
<v Speaker 1>with yet.</v>

1029
00:55:20.461 --> 00:55:23.520
<v Speaker 1>They're not fully articulated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have a strategy.</v>

1030
00:55:23.521 --> 00:55:25.710
<v Speaker 1>You don't have a full develop </v>
<v Speaker 1>representational system.</v>

1031
00:55:25.950 --> 00:55:28.970
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's still emotional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's like your,</v>

1032
00:55:29.070 --> 00:55:33.330
<v Speaker 1>your body and your mind come up with </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional representations first and only</v>

1033
00:55:33.331 --> 00:55:34.164
<v Speaker 1>as you worked through them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means to talk about them </v>

1034
00:55:36.361 --> 00:55:37.194
<v Speaker 1>essentially strategically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't even turn into words until </v>

1035
00:55:39.781 --> 00:55:40.614
<v Speaker 1>you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's where I think Freud went </v>

1036
00:55:42.361 --> 00:55:43.980
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's those things aren't repressed.</v>

1037
00:55:43.981 --> 00:55:46.230
<v Speaker 1>Although if they can be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not repressed.</v>

1038
00:55:46.410 --> 00:55:47.243
<v Speaker 1>They just never made it all the way up </v>
<v Speaker 1>to articulated representation and lots </v>

1039
00:55:51.781 --> 00:55:53.970
<v Speaker 1>of things are like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whenever you're in a bad mood,</v>

1040
00:55:53.971 --> 00:55:55.380
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in a bad mood.</v>

1041
00:55:56.250 --> 00:55:58.200
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1042
00:55:58.201 --> 00:56:00.750
<v Speaker 1>you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you know,</v>

1043
00:56:01.020 --> 00:56:02.620
<v Speaker 1>or you repressing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1044
00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:03.463
<v Speaker 1>you just too stupid to figure it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so then you're going to talk to </v>

1045
00:56:06.061 --> 00:56:08.280
<v Speaker 1>someone you know I'm in a bad mood and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1046
00:56:08.470 --> 00:56:09.480
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1047
00:56:09.660 --> 00:56:10.493
<v Speaker 1>how are you feeling now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll get all spiteful and tell you </v>

1048
00:56:13.081 --> 00:56:15.780
<v Speaker 1>how they're feeling and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they start to differentiate it.</v>

1049
00:56:15.810 --> 00:56:16.643
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they'll remember something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened at work and then you can kind </v>

1050
00:56:18.931 --> 00:56:21.780
<v Speaker 1>of map out the mood starts to loosen it.</v>

1051
00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:28.720
<v Speaker 1>We know from our research that such </v>
<v Speaker 1>empathic understanding,</v>

1052
00:56:29.170 --> 00:56:30.003
<v Speaker 1>understanding with a person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing about him is such an effective </v>

1053
00:56:33.011 --> 00:56:35.650
<v Speaker 1>approach that it can bring about major </v>
<v Speaker 1>changes in personality.</v>

1054
00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:36.633
<v Speaker 1>Some of you may be feeling that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>listen well to people and that you have </v>

1055
00:56:40.091 --> 00:56:40.924
<v Speaker 1>never seen such results.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The chances are very great indeed that </v>

1056
00:56:44.681 --> 00:56:47.740
<v Speaker 1>you're listening has not been of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>type I have described.</v>

1057
00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:50.313
<v Speaker 1>Fortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can suggest a little laboratory </v>

1058
00:56:51.671 --> 00:56:55.090
<v Speaker 1>experiment which you can try to test the</v>
<v Speaker 1>quality of your understanding.</v>

1059
00:56:56.050 --> 00:56:57.070
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is.</v>

1060
00:56:57.220 --> 00:57:00.860
<v Speaker 1>This is lovely because you don't often </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually get it.</v>

1061
00:57:00.870 --> 00:57:03.910
<v Speaker 1>Tell me from a therapist that actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>

1062
00:57:04.090 --> 00:57:04.923
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get sort of vague techniques like </v>

1063
00:57:07.810 --> 00:57:10.060
<v Speaker 1>help the person lay the cards out on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>table.</v>

1064
00:57:10.061 --> 00:57:11.060
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1065
00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:13.870
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of at a high level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstraction,</v>

1066
00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:19.440
<v Speaker 1>but this exercise you can actually do </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can do it a lot and if you do it</v>

1067
00:57:19.441 --> 00:57:20.590
<v Speaker 1>and we'll teach you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen.</v>

1068
00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:22.273
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1069
00:57:23.350 --> 00:57:27.010
<v Speaker 1>the next time you get into an argument </v>
<v Speaker 1>with your wife or your friends or with a</v>

1070
00:57:27.011 --> 00:57:27.844
<v Speaker 1>small group of friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>start the discussion for a moment and </v>

1071
00:57:29.951 --> 00:57:30.784
<v Speaker 1>for an experiment institute this rule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while you also don't have to be that </v>

1072
00:57:33.341 --> 00:57:34.930
<v Speaker 1>formal about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can just do it.</v>

1073
00:57:35.050 --> 00:57:35.883
<v Speaker 1>Once you know the the team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each person can speak up for himself </v>

1074
00:57:40.391 --> 00:57:41.224
<v Speaker 1>only after he is first restated the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas and feelings of the previous </v>

1075
00:57:46.091 --> 00:57:51.091
<v Speaker 1>speaker accurately</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to that speaker satisfaction.</v>

1076
00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:53.013
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so cool because here's the </v>

1077
00:57:54.371 --> 00:57:56.440
<v Speaker 1>typical argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're arguing,</v>

1078
00:57:56.441 --> 00:57:57.274
<v Speaker 1>I want to win,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you're telling me a bunch of </v>

1079
00:57:58.211 --> 00:57:59.044
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so then I take those things that I </v>

1080
00:58:00.611 --> 00:58:04.480
<v Speaker 1>turned them into the stupidest possible </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation of those things.</v>

1081
00:58:04.710 --> 00:58:05.543
<v Speaker 1>You know I wake in your argument and </v>
<v Speaker 1>make you look like a fool and then </v>

1082
00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:09.753
<v Speaker 1>destroy it and that's a strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fine that you're making your </v>

1083
00:58:12.791 --> 00:58:14.350
<v Speaker 1>opponent into a straw man Max.</v>

1084
00:58:14.350 --> 00:58:15.850
<v Speaker 1>The Straw man argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1085
00:58:16.180 --> 00:58:17.013
<v Speaker 1>You take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take what they're telling you and </v>

1086
00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:18.833
<v Speaker 1>your caricatured and that way you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>make them look absurd and make them be </v>

1087
00:58:22.361 --> 00:58:23.194
<v Speaker 1>ashamed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then of course you've set up this </v>

1088
00:58:24.651 --> 00:58:27.760
<v Speaker 1>skinny little opponent that you can just</v>
<v Speaker 1>demolish with one punch.</v>

1089
00:58:28.090 --> 00:58:32.560
<v Speaker 1>It's really crooked and it shows that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a coward because what it means is</v>

1090
00:58:32.620 --> 00:58:33.453
<v Speaker 1>you have to have an opponent that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>crippled in and thin and starving and </v>

1091
00:58:38.210 --> 00:58:40.990
<v Speaker 1>and inarticulate before you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly win,</v>

1092
00:58:41.890 --> 00:58:42.723
<v Speaker 1>before you could possibly progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a pathetic way of having an </v>

1093
00:58:44.741 --> 00:58:45.574
<v Speaker 1>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you should do is listen to the </v>

1094
00:58:46.481 --> 00:58:47.314
<v Speaker 1>person and help them make their argument</v>
<v Speaker 1>as strong as you possibly can and then </v>

1095
00:58:51.431 --> 00:58:54.400
<v Speaker 1>deal with that because then you're sure </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're,</v>

1096
00:58:54.500 --> 00:58:55.810
<v Speaker 1>you're taking them seriously.</v>

1097
00:58:56.560 --> 00:58:57.393
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1098
00:59:00.230 --> 00:59:02.450
<v Speaker 1>and to that speaker satisfaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1099
00:59:02.451 --> 00:59:03.271
<v Speaker 1>that's so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1100
00:59:03.271 --> 00:59:04.880
<v Speaker 1>so we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're having an argument.</v>

1101
00:59:04.950 --> 00:59:05.391
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1102
00:59:05.391 --> 00:59:06.224
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we'll have an argument about who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna be responsible for grocery </v>

1103
00:59:09.261 --> 00:59:10.094
<v Speaker 1>shopping or for doing the dishes or for </v>
<v Speaker 1>cooking or any of those domestic things </v>

1104
00:59:13.191 --> 00:59:17.570
<v Speaker 1>that continually caused couples to be at</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other's throat.</v>

1105
00:59:18.170 --> 00:59:19.003
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you'll have some arguments about you </v>

1106
00:59:21.351 --> 00:59:22.184
<v Speaker 1>should do whatever it is that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to do and in order for the </v>

1107
00:59:24.981 --> 00:59:25.814
<v Speaker 1>argument to progress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to tell you back what you said </v>

1108
00:59:28.250 --> 00:59:30.770
<v Speaker 1>and you have to agree that I put it </v>
<v Speaker 1>properly.</v>

1109
00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:32.360
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so annoying.</v>

1110
00:59:32.690 --> 00:59:33.523
<v Speaker 1>Like it just runs so contrary to what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to do because of course you </v>

1111
00:59:35.841 --> 00:59:39.860
<v Speaker 1>want to make another person sounds </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid so you could meet them this way.</v>

1112
00:59:39.861 --> 00:59:40.694
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that because you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>listen well enough so you actually </v>

1113
00:59:42.501 --> 00:59:47.030
<v Speaker 1>understood what they said and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to formulate their argument so that</v>

1114
00:59:47.031 --> 00:59:50.150
<v Speaker 1>they're willing to agree that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually constitutes their argument.</v>

1115
00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:52.790
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really,</v>

1116
00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:55.760
<v Speaker 1>it's difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's so useful because first of all,</v>

1117
00:59:55.761 --> 01:00:00.761
<v Speaker 1>it does mean that you understood them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and second immediately indicates to them</v>

1118
01:00:02.570 --> 01:00:03.403
<v Speaker 1>that you're not just trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're trying to listen and then </v>

1119
01:00:07.131 --> 01:00:07.964
<v Speaker 1>they're much less likely to get all </v>
<v Speaker 1>irritable and angry at you because at </v>

1120
01:00:10.851 --> 01:00:14.150
<v Speaker 1>least you're trying to listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not making them into a fool.</v>

1121
01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:15.153
<v Speaker 1>And you know often when people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to tell you what they want </v>

1122
01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:19.970
<v Speaker 1>because they're all afraid of telling </v>
<v Speaker 1>you what they want because you know,</v>

1123
01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.610
<v Speaker 1>maybe they never got what they wanted in</v>
<v Speaker 1>their whole life.</v>

1124
01:00:22.611 --> 01:00:23.444
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they've had a history of bad </v>

1125
01:00:24.171 --> 01:00:26.840
<v Speaker 1>relationships with poor parenting and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of thing,</v>

1126
01:00:27.050 --> 01:00:27.883
<v Speaker 1>you're just blooded terrified to tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>you that they actually want something </v>

1127
01:00:31.070 --> 01:00:31.903
<v Speaker 1>and so as soon as you indicate to them </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you actually heard what they said </v>

1128
01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:38.840
<v Speaker 1>and you're willing to take it seriously </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to formulate it properly,</v>

1129
01:00:39.260 --> 01:00:41.510
<v Speaker 1>well then it's like one step towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>trust.</v>

1130
01:00:41.810 --> 01:00:45.020
<v Speaker 1>I see you didn't listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You at least know where I'm coming from.</v>

1131
01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:47.060
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean you agree.</v>

1132
01:00:47.210 --> 01:00:48.043
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just because you understand someone's </v>

1133
01:00:49.311 --> 01:00:50.144
<v Speaker 1>argument doesn't mean you have to agree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at least you know what the argument </v>

1134
01:00:52.581 --> 01:00:55.670
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see what this would mean.</v>

1135
01:00:55.671 --> 01:00:56.504
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roger's got us continually his therapy </v>

1136
01:00:58.281 --> 01:00:59.114
<v Speaker 1>and I do this a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I listen to the person and </v>

1137
01:01:01.131 --> 01:01:03.980
<v Speaker 1>they kind of go through a narrative at </v>
<v Speaker 1>spontaneous narrative,</v>

1138
01:01:04.250 --> 01:01:07.760
<v Speaker 1>often following a chain of associations </v>
<v Speaker 1>as pointed out,</v>

1139
01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:09.980
<v Speaker 1>you'll come you spontaneous narrative </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll say,</v>

1140
01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:11.113
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounds to me like this is what you </v>

1141
01:01:12.591 --> 01:01:15.890
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll try to lay out the argument and</v>

1142
01:01:15.891 --> 01:01:16.724
<v Speaker 1>maybe now and then I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll ask for clarification if there's a </v>

1143
01:01:18.831 --> 01:01:19.664
<v Speaker 1>part I didn't understand or if I see </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's a part that seems </v>

1144
01:01:22.401 --> 01:01:23.530
<v Speaker 1>contradictory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1145
01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:25.880
<v Speaker 1>they said this thing here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing there,</v>

1146
01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:27.310
<v Speaker 1>and I don't tell them that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1147
01:01:27.890 --> 01:01:30.310
<v Speaker 1>seems to me that you said this here and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this here.</v>

1148
01:01:30.530 --> 01:01:32.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure how to put those together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't say,</v>

1149
01:01:32.721 --> 01:01:34.130
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes your argument,</v>

1150
01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:35.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>incoherent.</v>

1151
01:01:35.601 --> 01:01:36.434
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1152
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:39.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't get how to understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they go,</v>

1153
01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:41.360
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is.</v>

1154
01:01:41.450 --> 01:01:45.340
<v Speaker 1>Because people will admit to that if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>just pointed out flatly.</v>

1155
01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:46.300
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1156
01:01:46.310 --> 01:01:48.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm not involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just listening.</v>

1157
01:01:48.410 --> 01:01:51.230
<v Speaker 1>It's not my problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a problem.</v>

1158
01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:56.150
<v Speaker 1>And that's another thing that's useful </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the other person is entitled to their</v>

1159
01:01:56.151 --> 01:01:58.940
<v Speaker 1>suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't get to take it away.</v>

1160
01:01:58.970 --> 01:01:59.803
<v Speaker 1>It's their destiny so you can listen to </v>
<v Speaker 1>their problems without having to think </v>

1161
01:02:03.051 --> 01:02:07.100
<v Speaker 1>that you know you have to take them on </v>
<v Speaker 1>as if they're yours.</v>

1162
01:02:07.101 --> 01:02:09.620
<v Speaker 1>You have to mirror them like it's their </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

1163
01:02:09.650 --> 01:02:11.930
<v Speaker 1>It's like they have to figure it out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they and that's good.</v>

1164
01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:13.093
<v Speaker 1>You need a problem to figure out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not necessarily a terrible thing </v>

1165
01:02:15.561 --> 01:02:16.520
<v Speaker 1>that they have a problem.</v>

1166
01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:21.660
<v Speaker 1>It would simply mean that before </v>
<v Speaker 1>presenting your own point of view,</v>

1167
01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:23.033
<v Speaker 1>it would be necessary for you to really </v>
<v Speaker 1>achieve the other speakers frame of </v>

1168
01:02:25.831 --> 01:02:30.270
<v Speaker 1>reference to understand his thoughts and</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling so well that you could summarize</v>

1169
01:02:30.271 --> 01:02:31.104
<v Speaker 1>them for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's useful too because you know </v>

1170
01:02:33.121 --> 01:02:33.954
<v Speaker 1>the way we remember things is if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell me a long story and I tell it back </v>

1171
01:02:38.521 --> 01:02:40.920
<v Speaker 1>to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do not tell it back to you.</v>

1172
01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:47.340
<v Speaker 1>What happens is I listened to it and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>try to figure out what the thread of the</v>

1173
01:02:47.341 --> 01:02:50.940
<v Speaker 1>argument is and then when I dial it back</v>
<v Speaker 1>to you,</v>

1174
01:02:50.941 --> 01:02:54.960
<v Speaker 1>it's way shorter and tighter and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>means in some sense it's,</v>

1175
01:02:55.820 --> 01:02:58.920
<v Speaker 1>it's got all the essentials,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's got less of the baggage.</v>

1176
01:02:59.670 --> 01:03:00.503
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're kind of doing when </v>

1177
01:03:00.991 --> 01:03:03.810
<v Speaker 1>you ask someone to get to the point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they tell you this long story,</v>

1178
01:03:03.811 --> 01:03:04.644
<v Speaker 1>it's like this tree that is full of dead</v>
<v Speaker 1>branches and it hasn't been proved and </v>

1179
01:03:09.330 --> 01:03:10.163
<v Speaker 1>they're extending their and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the maybe the living branches you can </v>

1180
01:03:12.721 --> 01:03:13.554
<v Speaker 1>hardly even see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're concentrating on them and </v>

1181
01:03:15.151 --> 01:03:18.060
<v Speaker 1>then when you tell it back to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just tell them the part of the story</v>

1182
01:03:18.061 --> 01:03:20.250
<v Speaker 1>that's alive and they listened to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they think,</v>

1183
01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:21.480
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I meant,</v>

1184
01:03:21.870 --> 01:03:25.020
<v Speaker 1>and then that means you've changed the </v>
<v Speaker 1>memory,</v>

1185
01:03:25.140 --> 01:03:25.800
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1186
01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:27.330
<v Speaker 1>If they have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've changed the memory,</v>

1187
01:03:27.331 --> 01:03:28.164
<v Speaker 1>you've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've divested of all the excess </v>

1188
01:03:29.851 --> 01:03:32.520
<v Speaker 1>baggage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like pruning and that's what you're</v>

1189
01:03:32.521 --> 01:03:35.970
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that a dialogue is mental hygiene</v>

1190
01:03:36.930 --> 01:03:38.180
<v Speaker 1>and that's what people do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1191
01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:38.881
<v Speaker 1>you've got to wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1192
01:03:38.881 --> 01:03:40.650
<v Speaker 1>why don't we talk?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1193
01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:42.810
<v Speaker 1>it's to exchange information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1194
01:03:43.110 --> 01:03:44.490
<v Speaker 1>there's utility in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1195
01:03:44.510 --> 01:03:46.110
<v Speaker 1>like if you know how to do something and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1196
01:03:46.111 --> 01:03:48.830
<v Speaker 1>you can tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>

1197
01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.420
<v Speaker 1>that isn't the sort of thing that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>are doing most of the time.</v>

1198
01:03:51.421 --> 01:03:53.280
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time they're telling their </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories,</v>

1199
01:03:53.490 --> 01:03:56.630
<v Speaker 1>this is what happened to me right in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

1200
01:03:57.010 --> 01:03:58.170
<v Speaker 1>and then not a person will say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1201
01:03:58.171 --> 01:03:59.004
<v Speaker 1>this is what happened to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's this mutual attempt to </v>

1202
01:04:02.101 --> 01:04:02.934
<v Speaker 1>organize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how people are organizing their </v>

1203
01:04:04.411 --> 01:04:07.020
<v Speaker 1>brains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We organized our brains by talking,</v>

1204
01:04:07.950 --> 01:04:09.780
<v Speaker 1>and so if you don't have someone to </v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to you,</v>

1205
01:04:10.230 --> 01:04:13.080
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if it's over a few decades,</v>

1206
01:04:13.260 --> 01:04:17.160
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have a brain that's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a whole forest of trees that it needs.</v>

1207
01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:19.610
<v Speaker 1>A forest fire doesn't need just some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1208
01:04:19.630 --> 01:04:24.150
<v Speaker 1>trim and it's really in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you need to have someone to listen to</v>

1209
01:04:24.151 --> 01:04:24.984
<v Speaker 1>you and best way to hit someone like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is to find a bunch of people and </v>

1210
01:04:28.261 --> 01:04:32.220
<v Speaker 1>listen to them because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course then now that's a friendship.</v>

1211
01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:33.630
<v Speaker 1>That's a real friendship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1212
01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:36.180
<v Speaker 1>because you're both trying to move </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards a better place.</v>

1213
01:04:36.181 --> 01:04:39.180
<v Speaker 1>Whatever that place is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a great relationship.</v>

1214
01:04:39.181 --> 01:04:41.790
<v Speaker 1>Then sounds simple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it?</v>

1215
01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:44.393
<v Speaker 1>But if you try it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll discover it's one of the most </v>

1216
01:04:45.541 --> 01:04:47.280
<v Speaker 1>difficult things you've ever tried to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

1217
01:04:50.650 --> 01:04:51.483
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you've been able to see the other </v>

1218
01:04:52.511 --> 01:04:53.344
<v Speaker 1>person's point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your own comments will have to be </v>

1219
01:04:55.001 --> 01:04:56.740
<v Speaker 1>drastically revised.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1220
01:04:56.741 --> 01:05:01.060
<v Speaker 1>that's partly because now there are sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of vague complaints is tightened up to a</v>

1221
01:05:01.060 --> 01:05:01.893
<v Speaker 1>specific problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you have to reconfigure how you're </v>

1222
01:05:03.671 --> 01:05:04.504
<v Speaker 1>responding to address that problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You also find the emotion going on with </v>

1223
01:05:07.931 --> 01:05:08.764
<v Speaker 1>the discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the differences being reduced and those </v>

1224
01:05:12.041 --> 01:05:15.370
<v Speaker 1>differences which remain being on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rational and understandable sort.</v>

1225
01:05:18.730 --> 01:05:21.760
<v Speaker 1>If you were really willing to understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>a person in this way,</v>

1226
01:05:21.910 --> 01:05:22.743
<v Speaker 1>if you're willing to answer their </v>
<v Speaker 1>private world and see the like the way </v>

1227
01:05:25.601 --> 01:05:26.434
<v Speaker 1>their life appears to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you run the risk of being changed </v>

1228
01:05:28.541 --> 01:05:30.020
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is good.</v>

1229
01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:30.933
<v Speaker 1>That's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're involved in a real </v>

1230
01:05:33.671 --> 01:05:34.504
<v Speaker 1>conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way that you will change will be </v>

1231
01:05:36.521 --> 01:05:37.760
<v Speaker 1>beneficial to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>

1232
01:05:37.780 --> 01:05:39.970
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a challenging thing because it will</v>

1233
01:05:39.971 --> 01:05:43.690
<v Speaker 1>mean that you can't stick to the little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1234
01:05:43.691 --> 01:05:46.690
<v Speaker 1>rigid framework that you had entering </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the argument.</v>

1235
01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:49.930
<v Speaker 1>You have to loosen that up and be </v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to open the door and you know,</v>

1236
01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:51.730
<v Speaker 1>change the walls of your house.</v>

1237
01:05:55.530 --> 01:05:57.900
<v Speaker 1>You might see it his way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That wouldn't be good.</v>

1238
01:05:58.110 --> 01:06:01.560
<v Speaker 1>You might find yourself influenced or </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in your attitudes or personality.</v>

1239
01:06:02.610 --> 01:06:03.443
<v Speaker 1>The risk of being changed is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most frightening prospects most of us </v>

1240
01:06:05.911 --> 01:06:07.530
<v Speaker 1>can face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1241
01:06:07.531 --> 01:06:11.640
<v Speaker 1>imagine so when you're trying to build </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself into high fully fledged you.</v>

1242
01:06:12.150 --> 01:06:13.260
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's one way of doing it.</v>

1243
01:06:13.350 --> 01:06:14.183
<v Speaker 1>Just hang around with people like you </v>
<v Speaker 1>who think the same way you do and then </v>

1244
01:06:17.821 --> 01:06:20.340
<v Speaker 1>whenever you talk they just reflect back</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you have to say.</v>

1245
01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:21.353
<v Speaker 1>Or you can start putting yourself in </v>
<v Speaker 1>situations that you're uncomfortable </v>

1246
01:06:23.731 --> 01:06:24.840
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1247
01:06:25.650 --> 01:06:26.483
<v Speaker 1>pushing yourself a little bit and you go</v>
<v Speaker 1>out where there are people that aren't </v>

1248
01:06:28.291 --> 01:06:31.320
<v Speaker 1>like you and then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1249
01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:33.810
<v Speaker 1>how am I going to get to understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>these people?</v>

1250
01:06:33.811 --> 01:06:34.644
<v Speaker 1>And the first thing you do is you got to</v>
<v Speaker 1>pay attention and you got to listen and </v>

1251
01:06:36.751 --> 01:06:39.440
<v Speaker 1>then maybe you'll be able to interact </v>
<v Speaker 1>with them and then who.</v>

1252
01:06:39.660 --> 01:06:40.493
<v Speaker 1>That's another environment that you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>mastered and then there's more of you </v>

1253
01:06:44.430 --> 01:06:46.170
<v Speaker 1>because now you can operate here and </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

1254
01:06:46.171 --> 01:06:48.060
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that was kind of fun.</v>

1255
01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:48.953
<v Speaker 1>So now I'll go here and we'll try this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you go there and you listened and </v>

1256
01:06:51.721 --> 01:06:53.850
<v Speaker 1>you pay attention and all of a sudden </v>
<v Speaker 1>bang,</v>

1257
01:06:53.970 --> 01:06:58.440
<v Speaker 1>you can operate there and if you do that</v>
<v Speaker 1>over like a 15 year period,</v>

1258
01:06:58.710 --> 01:07:03.360
<v Speaker 1>you'll be someone who could go anywhere </v>
<v Speaker 1>and not fit in exactly that.</v>

1259
01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:05.490
<v Speaker 1>That's like you're invisible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like you're fitting.</v>

1260
01:07:05.491 --> 01:07:07.470
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you can operate there,</v>

1261
01:07:08.190 --> 01:07:10.560
<v Speaker 1>you can talk and listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can gather information,</v>

1262
01:07:10.620 --> 01:07:11.453
<v Speaker 1>you can trade your useful there and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not gonna run up against people </v>

1263
01:07:16.681 --> 01:07:17.610
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>risk,</v>

1264
01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:21.000
<v Speaker 1>unnecessary conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you listen to people,</v>

1265
01:07:21.420 --> 01:07:23.910
<v Speaker 1>you just cannot believe what people will</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you if you listen to them.</v>

1266
01:07:24.420 --> 01:07:25.740
<v Speaker 1>It is absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can.</v>

1267
01:07:25.890 --> 01:07:26.723
<v Speaker 1>If you can listen to people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will tell you profound things so </v>

1268
01:07:29.611 --> 01:07:32.720
<v Speaker 1>fast that it just makes your head spin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1269
01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:34.680
<v Speaker 1>because people are really weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>creatures.</v>

1270
01:07:34.681 --> 01:07:36.430
<v Speaker 1>They're like Dostoyevsky characters </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1271
01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:37.713
<v Speaker 1>There are peculiar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think in weird ways and they have </v>

1272
01:07:39.931 --> 01:07:40.764
<v Speaker 1>weird experiences and bizarre dreams and</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas about the future political </v>

1273
01:07:45.571 --> 01:07:46.404
<v Speaker 1>theories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just as crazy as you could </v>

1274
01:07:48.391 --> 01:07:50.250
<v Speaker 1>possibly imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you listen to them,</v>

1275
01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:52.660
<v Speaker 1>they'll tell you why they think these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things and it's.</v>

1276
01:07:53.490 --> 01:07:54.323
<v Speaker 1>It's not boring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another issue is if the </v>

1277
01:07:56.341 --> 01:07:57.174
<v Speaker 1>conversation is boring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are not listening because if you're </v>

1278
01:08:00.511 --> 01:08:01.344
<v Speaker 1>listening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the conversation will change so that it </v>

1279
01:08:03.211 --> 01:08:04.044
<v Speaker 1>won't be boring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can tell if you're in a </v>

1280
01:08:04.891 --> 01:08:09.891
<v Speaker 1>conversation that's foreign,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're someone at least is not listening</v>

1281
01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:11.233
<v Speaker 1>and it could easily be you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I enter as fully as I enabled into </v>

1282
01:08:15.441 --> 01:08:18.740
<v Speaker 1>the private world of the neurotic or </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychotic individual,</v>

1283
01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:21.830
<v Speaker 1>isn't there a risk that I might become </v>
<v Speaker 1>lost in that world?</v>

1284
01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:27.650
<v Speaker 1>Most of us are afraid to take that risk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The great majority of us cannot listen.</v>

1285
01:08:27.830 --> 01:08:31.880
<v Speaker 1>We found ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we find ourselves compelled to evaluate,</v>

1286
01:08:32.330 --> 01:08:34.760
<v Speaker 1>and the evaluation is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to keep you away.</v>

1287
01:08:34.790 --> 01:08:38.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to pigeonhole you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>classify you.</v>

1288
01:08:38.270 --> 01:08:39.103
<v Speaker 1>Make the classification negative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Describe you as irrelevant and push you </v>

1289
01:08:42.291 --> 01:08:45.170
<v Speaker 1>aside because then I don't have to pay </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>

1290
01:08:45.230 --> 01:08:49.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to listen and I can stay in</v>
<v Speaker 1>my box of certainty,</v>

1291
01:08:49.510 --> 01:08:51.410
<v Speaker 1>my little narrow box of certainty.</v>

1292
01:08:53.690 --> 01:08:54.523
<v Speaker 1>The great majority of us cannot listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We find ourselves to pell to evaluate </v>

1293
01:08:57.231 --> 01:08:58.064
<v Speaker 1>because listening is too dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first requirement is courage and we </v>

1294
01:09:01.371 --> 01:09:02.420
<v Speaker 1>do not always have it.</v>

1295
01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:11.800
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Carl Rogers,</v>

1296
01:09:13.900 --> 01:09:14.733
<v Speaker 1>he's a phenomenologist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So think it's your experience that's </v>

1297
01:09:18.311 --> 01:09:19.144
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to represent that experience </v>

1298
01:09:21.850 --> 01:09:22.683
<v Speaker 1>and you need to communicate it to other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and you have to communicate it </v>

1299
01:09:25.211 --> 01:09:26.044
<v Speaker 1>within a frame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the proper frame is we're trying to </v>

1300
01:09:28.151 --> 01:09:32.070
<v Speaker 1>make things better here and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to adopt that frame,</v>

1301
01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:34.480
<v Speaker 1>that's not just a simple statement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1302
01:09:34.870 --> 01:09:35.703
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can tell yourself that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to put yourself in that state of </v>

1303
01:09:38.261 --> 01:09:39.094
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to do that you have to really think </v>

1304
01:09:40.631 --> 01:09:43.240
<v Speaker 1>through your heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to decide like,</v>

1305
01:09:43.450 --> 01:09:47.380
<v Speaker 1>what are you up to?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you here to make things worse or are</v>

1306
01:09:47.381 --> 01:09:49.810
<v Speaker 1>you here to make things better?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1307
01:09:49.811 --> 01:09:50.644
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well clearly I'm here to make things </v>

1308
01:09:51.731 --> 01:09:52.564
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1309
01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:54.190
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>

1310
01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:55.593
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's hard and people are full of </v>

1311
01:09:57.821 --> 01:09:58.654
<v Speaker 1>resentment and fear and anger and they'd</v>
<v Speaker 1>be hurt and all sorts of ways that they </v>

1312
01:10:02.081 --> 01:10:05.860
<v Speaker 1>want to take revenge and like they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>just full of contradictory impulses.</v>

1313
01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:06.993
<v Speaker 1>And so to weave all those contradictory </v>
<v Speaker 1>impulses together to overcome all those </v>

1314
01:10:12.131 --> 01:10:16.180
<v Speaker 1>hurts and disappointments in and reasons</v>
<v Speaker 1>for revenge and resentment,</v>

1315
01:10:17.310 --> 01:10:19.120
<v Speaker 1>you have to do all that before you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

1316
01:10:19.121 --> 01:10:21.220
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm here to make things better.</v>

1317
01:10:21.370 --> 01:10:22.203
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're still possessed by </v>
<v Speaker 1>those sorts of experiences and </v>

1318
01:10:24.251 --> 01:10:25.084
<v Speaker 1>contradictions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be motivated to make </v>

1319
01:10:26.591 --> 01:10:27.424
<v Speaker 1>things worse all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just out of revenge and spite you know </v>

1320
01:10:30.281 --> 01:10:31.240
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've been hurt,</v>

1321
01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:34.450
<v Speaker 1>you're going to hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so do adopt.</v>

1322
01:10:34.451 --> 01:10:35.284
<v Speaker 1>The framework that Rogers is talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about is it's difficult enterprise and </v>

1323
01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:42.910
<v Speaker 1>partly it'll come about the more you </v>
<v Speaker 1>listen because the more you listen,</v>

1324
01:10:42.970 --> 01:10:45.280
<v Speaker 1>you have the chance to exchange </v>
<v Speaker 1>information,</v>

1325
01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:46.533
<v Speaker 1>the more you will deal with those inner </v>
<v Speaker 1>contradictions in that sort of </v>

1326
01:10:48.341 --> 01:10:50.840
<v Speaker 1>collection of hurts and irritations </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1327
01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:53.800
<v Speaker 1>that are corrupting you in twisted you </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the wrong direction.</v>

1328
01:11:03.990 --> 01:11:06.480
<v Speaker 1>So the rigid perspective is extremely </v>
<v Speaker 1>useful.</v>

1329
01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:07.613
<v Speaker 1>It's very useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason I concentrated on that one </v>

1330
01:11:09.661 --> 01:11:12.330
<v Speaker 1>quote of his today is because it's such </v>
<v Speaker 1>a useful thing,</v>

1331
01:11:12.340 --> 01:11:15.540
<v Speaker 1>you can try right away the next time </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking to someone,</v>

1332
01:11:16.140 --> 01:11:18.150
<v Speaker 1>maybe have a friend who wants to talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>things over.</v>

1333
01:11:18.210 --> 01:11:21.270
<v Speaker 1>It's like listen to them and then when </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a pause say,</v>

1334
01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:22.193
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounds to me like this is what you </v>

1335
01:11:23.221 --> 01:11:24.660
<v Speaker 1>meant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they'll go,</v>

1336
01:11:25.230 --> 01:11:26.750
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what I meant.</v>

1337
01:11:26.790 --> 01:11:29.400
<v Speaker 1>Maybe if you were really listening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll be real happy about that because</v>

1338
01:11:29.401 --> 01:11:32.340
<v Speaker 1>they didn't know what they meant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just telling you the story about</v>

1339
01:11:32.341 --> 01:11:35.150
<v Speaker 1>why they're annoying and so then you'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

1340
01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:36.360
<v Speaker 1>oh wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got it,</v>

1341
01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:39.210
<v Speaker 1>and then there'll be happy and they'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you something else and like they'll</v>

1342
01:11:39.211 --> 01:11:43.440
<v Speaker 1>walk away from that conversation much </v>
<v Speaker 1>lighter and you will too.</v>

1343
01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:46.470
<v Speaker 1>Even though it's a weird thing because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think,</v>

1344
01:11:46.471 --> 01:11:47.304
<v Speaker 1>well if you listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are going to dump a bunch of </v>

1345
01:11:48.241 --> 01:11:49.074
<v Speaker 1>trouble on you.</v>

1346
01:11:49.530 --> 01:11:51.660
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1347
01:11:51.661 --> 01:11:52.494
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you're willing to listen despite </v>

1348
01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:59.430
<v Speaker 1>the fact that there might be a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>trouble dumped on you,</v>

1349
01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:00.473
<v Speaker 1>then you've also pulled yourself that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the sort of person who can </v>

1350
01:12:03.121 --> 01:12:07.140
<v Speaker 1>tolerate having a bunch of trouble </v>
<v Speaker 1>dumped on yourself and that's like,</v>

1351
01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:11.820
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an extremely positive attitude to</v>

1352
01:12:11.821 --> 01:12:14.320
<v Speaker 1>take towards yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want.</v>

1353
01:12:14.370 --> 01:12:16.110
<v Speaker 1>You're not just saying you're acting it </v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

1354
01:12:16.111 --> 01:12:19.020
<v Speaker 1>and so that's a sign of faith in </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself and you're not.</v>

1355
01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:20.333
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said you were stupid like you are in </v>

1356
01:12:21.391 --> 01:12:23.640
<v Speaker 1>relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're not totally stupid.</v>

1357
01:12:23.870 --> 01:12:26.420
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll be able to notice that you,</v>

1358
01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:27.393
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've been willing to expose yourself </v>

1359
01:12:28.951 --> 01:12:33.210
<v Speaker 1>to a risk and when your body and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind you're watching that,</v>

1360
01:12:33.211 --> 01:12:34.440
<v Speaker 1>they'll think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1361
01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:38.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm the sort of thing that can </v>
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily expose itself to a risk.</v>

1362
01:12:38.790 --> 01:12:39.623
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like the secrets to making </v>

1363
01:12:40.591 --> 01:12:41.610
<v Speaker 1>yourself strong.</v>

1364
01:12:42.430 --> 01:12:46.680
<v Speaker 1>It's exposure and so you can do that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>every conversation and that toughens you</v>

1365
01:12:46.681 --> 01:12:50.280
<v Speaker 1>up as well as informing you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very powerful technique,</v>

1366
01:12:50.281 --> 01:12:52.920
<v Speaker 1>so I would recommend try it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see what happens.</v>

1367
01:12:53.220 --> 01:12:54.053
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also fun because it's like you're </v>

1368
01:12:56.131 --> 01:12:56.964
<v Speaker 1>following a thread of the conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're really listening to the </v>

1369
01:12:59.221 --> 01:13:00.054
<v Speaker 1>conversation will continue and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>continues in a meaningful way and then </v>

1370
01:13:03.631 --> 01:13:04.464
<v Speaker 1>you know that you're in the right place </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's like a challenge to your </v>

1371
01:13:06.661 --> 01:13:10.440
<v Speaker 1>capacity to pay attention and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get engaged in the convert.</v>

1372
01:13:10.470 --> 01:13:11.303
<v Speaker 1>All conversations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get engaged in them and then you're </v>

1373
01:13:13.801 --> 01:13:17.130
<v Speaker 1>in engaging conversations all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good thing,</v>

1374
01:13:17.970 --> 01:13:19.230
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1375
01:13:19.260 --> 01:13:20.093
<v Speaker 1>we'll see you.</v>
