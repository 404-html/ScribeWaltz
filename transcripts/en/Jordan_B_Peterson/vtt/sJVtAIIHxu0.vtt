1
00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:01.593
<v Speaker 1>And I want to tell you the story today </v>
<v Speaker 1>that set the foundation of Western </v>

2
00:00:05.761 --> 00:00:10.761
<v Speaker 1>civilization or one of the stories that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the foundation of Western civilization,</v>

3
00:00:11.791 --> 00:00:12.624
<v Speaker 1>because I think the Egyptian story </v>
<v Speaker 1>qualifies and I think the Mesopotamian </v>

4
00:00:16.231 --> 00:00:20.400
<v Speaker 1>story qualifies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so this is the Judeo Christian,</v>

5
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.310
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>genesis story,</v>

6
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.090
<v Speaker 1>which I think is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a staggering story.</v>

7
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.273
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the structure of the Old </v>

8
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.140
<v Speaker 1>Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

9
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.250
<v Speaker 1>what happens first near the first is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's,</v>

10
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:38.743
<v Speaker 1>there's two things that constitute what </v>
<v Speaker 1>I think are a radical split between </v>

11
00:00:42.601 --> 00:00:47.601
<v Speaker 1>different forms of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of them is Noah's flood where</v>

12
00:00:48.241 --> 00:00:51.150
<v Speaker 1>all the chaos comes washing back in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world is remade.</v>

13
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:52.463
<v Speaker 1>So there's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the time before the flood now in </v>

14
00:00:54.661 --> 00:00:59.661
<v Speaker 1>more traditional Christian societies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so say 150 years ago,</v>

15
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.313
<v Speaker 1>that was definitely considered a special</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of time before the flood compared </v>

16
00:01:06.271 --> 00:01:07.140
<v Speaker 1>to after the flood.</v>

17
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.860
<v Speaker 1>And I think that the old testament is </v>
<v Speaker 1>set up that way.</v>

18
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.903
<v Speaker 1>There's also the tower of Babel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this story of the Tower of Babel </v>

19
00:01:14.341 --> 00:01:15.174
<v Speaker 1>where people build a tower that's going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to reach to heaven and God basically </v>

20
00:01:18.781 --> 00:01:19.614
<v Speaker 1>stops them by making it unable to </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate with each other and then </v>

21
00:01:24.271 --> 00:01:27.720
<v Speaker 1>they dispersed around the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's also a kind of chaos story.</v>

22
00:01:27.721 --> 00:01:30.690
<v Speaker 1>So there's the tower of Babel and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>story of Noah.</v>

23
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.780
<v Speaker 1>And then after that then there's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>story of Abraham.</v>

24
00:01:33.781 --> 00:01:34.614
<v Speaker 1>And what happens is that the stories in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the old testament start to become </v>

25
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.420
<v Speaker 1>historical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

26
00:01:39.421 --> 00:01:42.000
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like tribal history in a sense.</v>

27
00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:43.830
<v Speaker 1>Like they're mythologized tribal </v>
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

28
00:01:43.831 --> 00:01:45.450
<v Speaker 1>So they're more than just tribal </v>
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

29
00:01:45.451 --> 00:01:47.640
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before that,</v>

30
00:01:47.641 --> 00:01:48.474
<v Speaker 1>I think what they are is they're almost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're almost pure archetype and we </v>

31
00:01:52.501 --> 00:01:57.270
<v Speaker 1>have no idea how old the stories are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we know that the story of creation in</v>

32
00:01:57.271 --> 00:01:59.430
<v Speaker 1>genesis at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the beginning of Genesis,</v>

33
00:01:59.431 --> 00:02:00.264
<v Speaker 1>there's actually two creation stories </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and there are timelines don't </v>

34
00:02:03.031 --> 00:02:04.260
<v Speaker 1>exactly match up.</v>

35
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.590
<v Speaker 1>And the hypothesis basically is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that one tribal group or,</v>

36
00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.753
<v Speaker 1>or group of tribes had one creation </v>
<v Speaker 1>story and another tribal group or group </v>

37
00:02:17.041 --> 00:02:20.250
<v Speaker 1>of tribes had another tribal creation </v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

38
00:02:20.251 --> 00:02:21.084
<v Speaker 1>And they came together and they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>really know how to sort out their damn </v>

39
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.840
<v Speaker 1>creation stories because they both held </v>
<v Speaker 1>them as sacred.</v>

40
00:02:27.841 --> 00:02:28.674
<v Speaker 1>And so what seemed to have happened over</v>
<v Speaker 1>time was that those stories were told </v>

41
00:02:32.641 --> 00:02:35.100
<v Speaker 1>and then when they were written down an </v>
<v Speaker 1>editor,</v>

42
00:02:35.101 --> 00:02:39.150
<v Speaker 1>they called the redactor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tried to sequence them so they made some</v>

43
00:02:39.151 --> 00:02:39.984
<v Speaker 1>sort of sense and a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the Bible is actually the </v>

44
00:02:43.801 --> 00:02:44.634
<v Speaker 1>attempt to take diverse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Archaic Orchid Temple and Cause I </v>

45
00:02:51.721 --> 00:02:52.554
<v Speaker 1>historical stories and to organize them </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a narrative manner while </v>

46
00:02:57.691 --> 00:03:01.600
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously minimizing internal </v>
<v Speaker 1>contradictions and so very,</v>

47
00:03:01.601 --> 00:03:02.434
<v Speaker 1>very difficult thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not like only one person did </v>

48
00:03:04.631 --> 00:03:06.520
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thousands of people have participated in</v>

49
00:03:06.521 --> 00:03:08.500
<v Speaker 1>doing it over a huge stretches of time.</v>

50
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.053
<v Speaker 1>So the historical element of the Bible </v>
<v Speaker 1>is probably roughly in the same of the </v>

51
00:03:18.611 --> 00:03:21.880
<v Speaker 1>same age as the Mesopotamian stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

52
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:22.803
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can stretch written history back </v>

53
00:03:24.431 --> 00:03:25.660
<v Speaker 1>about 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

54
00:03:25.661 --> 00:03:27.580
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe a little bit farther than that.</v>

55
00:03:27.581 --> 00:03:30.790
<v Speaker 1>So that's all we're talking about with </v>
<v Speaker 1>regards to written history.</v>

56
00:03:30.791 --> 00:03:32.680
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people think of 5,000</v>

57
00:03:32.681 --> 00:03:35.170
<v Speaker 1>years ago as a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a long time,</v>

58
00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's only 5,100</v>

59
00:03:37.691 --> 00:03:38.524
<v Speaker 1>year old men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a very interesting way to think </v>

60
00:03:41.561 --> 00:03:42.221
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

61
00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:43.860
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not a very long,</v>

62
00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.610
<v Speaker 1>long period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The stories before the flood,</v>

63
00:03:48.611 --> 00:03:53.110
<v Speaker 1>I think they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're indeterminately ancient.</v>

64
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.260
<v Speaker 1>I think they have their roots in like </v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

65
00:03:56.261 --> 00:03:57.094
<v Speaker 1>very early shamonic practices and their </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with ways of thinking that </v>

66
00:04:01.481 --> 00:04:02.314
<v Speaker 1>have characterized people ever since </v>
<v Speaker 1>they became people ever since they </v>

67
00:04:05.381 --> 00:04:07.060
<v Speaker 1>became whatever we are.</v>

68
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.600
<v Speaker 1>There have been human beings like us </v>
<v Speaker 1>anatomically speaking for about 150,000</v>

69
00:04:13.421 --> 00:04:17.470
<v Speaker 1>years and we're also a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>neanderthal,</v>

70
00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.230
<v Speaker 1>about five percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two to five percent,</v>

71
00:04:20.231 --> 00:04:21.970
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

72
00:04:21.971 --> 00:04:26.971
<v Speaker 1>but are anatomically similar ancestors </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been around for about 150,000</v>

73
00:04:28.781 --> 00:04:29.614
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Looks like we discovered fire about 2 </v>

74
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.393
<v Speaker 1>million years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we've been cooking for 2 million </v>

75
00:04:36.191 --> 00:04:39.220
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

76
00:04:39.221 --> 00:04:41.320
<v Speaker 1>it kind of gives you a bit of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>timeframe.</v>

77
00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.490
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first part of the.</v>

78
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:47.043
<v Speaker 1>There's basically in the genesis story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a story about the creation of </v>

79
00:04:50.531 --> 00:04:53.650
<v Speaker 1>being and then there's two stories </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>

80
00:04:53.651 --> 00:04:56.440
<v Speaker 1>and then there's the story about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>creation of human beings,</v>

81
00:04:56.441 --> 00:04:58.890
<v Speaker 1>and so the first part of the story I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>

82
00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to read this to you because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't.</v>

83
00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:06.210
<v Speaker 1>It's too complicated for me to just spin</v>
<v Speaker 1>out spontaneously.</v>

84
00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:11.403
<v Speaker 1>There are two structural elements </v>
<v Speaker 1>described in the first chapter in </v>

85
00:05:13.631 --> 00:05:18.040
<v Speaker 1>genesis chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one and heavens and the earth.</v>

86
00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.470
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's two structural elements,</v>

87
00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:21.453
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>process creation and one actor God or </v>

88
00:05:25.121 --> 00:05:28.090
<v Speaker 1>the word of God who is engaged in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>

89
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.770
<v Speaker 1>The first structural element,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos is signified by a word.</v>

90
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.400
<v Speaker 1>This is a Hebrew word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tail that means chaos by Tau,</v>

91
00:05:38.611 --> 00:05:39.444
<v Speaker 1>who for waste or for matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without substance and by the Bohu for </v>

92
00:05:43.181 --> 00:05:44.014
<v Speaker 1>emptiness or confusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the chaos out of which God extracts </v>

93
00:05:48.461 --> 00:05:52.930
<v Speaker 1>order has those elements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's chaos,</v>

94
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:57.440
<v Speaker 1>waste matter without substance and </v>
<v Speaker 1>emptiness and confusion.</v>

95
00:05:57.441 --> 00:05:58.274
<v Speaker 1>So interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a psychological element there </v>

96
00:05:59.841 --> 00:06:00.411
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

97
00:06:00.411 --> 00:06:01.244
<v Speaker 1>So I would say in some sense it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>equivalent to the chaos that you fall </v>

98
00:06:05.601 --> 00:06:08.360
<v Speaker 1>into when everything falls apart around </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

99
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:09.583
<v Speaker 1>And that's associated with a shamonic </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that during the shamonic </v>

100
00:06:12.171 --> 00:06:13.004
<v Speaker 1>transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Sharman goes back to the beginning </v>

101
00:06:15.021 --> 00:06:15.854
<v Speaker 1>of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking into the chaos that </v>

102
00:06:17.961 --> 00:06:18.794
<v Speaker 1>proceeds the emergence of order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's part of the shamanic </v>

103
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:23.000
<v Speaker 1>transformation ritual.</v>

104
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:28.270
<v Speaker 1>So the chaos that the chaos that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualized as the ground of being is</v>

105
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:32.300
<v Speaker 1>partly the potential out of which matter</v>
<v Speaker 1>arises,</v>

106
00:06:32.301 --> 00:06:34.820
<v Speaker 1>but it's also partly the state of </v>
<v Speaker 1>confusion,</v>

107
00:06:34.821 --> 00:06:35.654
<v Speaker 1>that urine when everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when order falls apart around you and </v>

108
00:06:38.421 --> 00:06:39.950
<v Speaker 1>that that makes sense if you think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

109
00:06:39.951 --> 00:06:40.784
<v Speaker 1>because the order that's being described</v>
<v Speaker 1>in genesis is the order that makes up </v>

110
00:06:43.851 --> 00:06:44.684
<v Speaker 1>being and so it makes sense when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>order that makes up your being </v>

111
00:06:47.631 --> 00:06:50.270
<v Speaker 1>collapses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're going to fall into something</v>

112
00:06:50.271 --> 00:06:51.104
<v Speaker 1>that's equivalent to the original chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very interesting way of thinking </v>

113
00:06:54.711 --> 00:06:55.544
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's metaphorical by the </v>

114
00:06:57.261 --> 00:06:59.120
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not metaphorical.</v>

115
00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:01.550
<v Speaker 1>It's a different way of describing </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality,</v>

116
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:06.320
<v Speaker 1>so it's not like a metaphor for matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's different than that.</v>

117
00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:07.173
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a analysis of the structural </v>

118
00:07:08.301 --> 00:07:09.134
<v Speaker 1>components of being and basically what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have is chaos order and the thing </v>

119
00:07:12.711 --> 00:07:13.544
<v Speaker 1>that mediates between them and we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about that already as being the </v>

120
00:07:16.251 --> 00:07:21.251
<v Speaker 1>fundamental tripartite constituents of </v>
<v Speaker 1>of reality itself.</v>

121
00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:23.143
<v Speaker 1>There has to be potential,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there has to be something to interpret </v>

122
00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:26.444
<v Speaker 1>the potential,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there has to be something to </v>

123
00:07:27.471 --> 00:07:28.304
<v Speaker 1>mediate between the two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these three words take home tow who </v>

124
00:07:34.251 --> 00:07:35.084
<v Speaker 1>and Vrbo who are very interesting for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>variety of reasons and profitably bear </v>

125
00:07:38.151 --> 00:07:42.350
<v Speaker 1>further investigation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Canadian Rabbi Itzhak Marmer Stein,</v>

126
00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:47.000
<v Speaker 1>who has begun to explain the Torah one </v>
<v Speaker 1>word at a time describes tale.</v>

127
00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.760
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take them entire.</v>

128
00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:51.530
<v Speaker 1>Matt are the same word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

129
00:07:51.531 --> 00:07:53.090
<v Speaker 1>so that's worth knowing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's.</v>

130
00:07:53.091 --> 00:07:53.924
<v Speaker 1>I got that from Northrop Frye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the tail is a is like the first </v>

131
00:07:57.471 --> 00:07:59.030
<v Speaker 1>syllable of the word tire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matt.</v>

132
00:07:59.060 --> 00:07:59.893
<v Speaker 1>And so we know that the Mesopotamian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people think the Mesopotamian </v>

133
00:08:03.411 --> 00:08:04.244
<v Speaker 1>creation story preceded the creation </v>
<v Speaker 1>story that's in the Judeo Christian </v>

134
00:08:08.301 --> 00:08:09.950
<v Speaker 1>account,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no one really knows.</v>

135
00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:10.813
<v Speaker 1>There was like a slew of creation </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories with roughly similar </v>

136
00:08:14.241 --> 00:08:16.550
<v Speaker 1>substructures in the Middle East at that</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

137
00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:20.690
<v Speaker 1>And the Mesopotamian stories of </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifestation of it and so to the Judaeo</v>

138
00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:21.523
<v Speaker 1>Christian story and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their temporal order I don't think is </v>

139
00:08:24.021 --> 00:08:24.854
<v Speaker 1>actually even calculable because I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>they both disappear into prehistory </v>

140
00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.620
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

141
00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:31.633
<v Speaker 1>But it's very interesting to know that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the tail is associated with the idea of </v>

142
00:08:34.761 --> 00:08:35.271
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matt,</v>

143
00:08:35.271 --> 00:08:38.690
<v Speaker 1>because it also gives you some idea of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the because you don't know what the hell</v>

144
00:08:38.691 --> 00:08:40.460
<v Speaker 1>ancient Hebrew words mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

145
00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:42.980
<v Speaker 1>Well how do you know that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not there anymore.</v>

146
00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:44.083
<v Speaker 1>And so it's interesting to see the </v>
<v Speaker 1>association network so you can </v>

147
00:08:46.461 --> 00:08:49.790
<v Speaker 1>understand the concepts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so whatever the tail ms,</v>

148
00:08:49.791 --> 00:08:53.400
<v Speaker 1>which is this preexistent chaos is sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of like tie matt,</v>

149
00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:56.850
<v Speaker 1>who's the terrible thing that raises up </v>
<v Speaker 1>or head when chaos is,</v>

150
00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:58.860
<v Speaker 1>is coming back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also the thing that,</v>

151
00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:00.053
<v Speaker 1>that Marta has to confront with his eyes</v>
<v Speaker 1>open and that figure is very much like </v>

152
00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:05.483
<v Speaker 1>the word of God in the Judeo Christian </v>
<v Speaker 1>story because the word of God is the </v>

153
00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:10.493
<v Speaker 1>thing that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's exploratory and communicative and </v>

154
00:09:13.291 --> 00:09:16.230
<v Speaker 1>it's the thing that that raises order </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of chaos.</v>

155
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:17.543
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think that you can understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>that without understanding or I think </v>

156
00:09:22.141 --> 00:09:22.974
<v Speaker 1>that understanding the Mesopotamian </v>
<v Speaker 1>story and the role of Marduk in </v>

157
00:09:26.161 --> 00:09:26.994
<v Speaker 1>relationship to time outs sheds a </v>
<v Speaker 1>substantial amount of light on the </v>

158
00:09:30.361 --> 00:09:33.270
<v Speaker 1>relationship between the word of God and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the initial chaos.</v>

159
00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:34.283
<v Speaker 1>They're parallel ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that I should tell </v>

160
00:09:37.261 --> 00:09:38.094
<v Speaker 1>you about Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is which is incomprehensible to </v>

161
00:09:41.131 --> 00:09:43.470
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand it,</v>

162
00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:44.843
<v Speaker 1>is that so one of the representations of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the word of God that extracts order out </v>

163
00:09:49.711 --> 00:09:50.544
<v Speaker 1>of chaos is logos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly the root word of </v>

164
00:09:53.101 --> 00:09:54.720
<v Speaker 1>logic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a lot more than that.</v>

165
00:09:54.721 --> 00:09:55.554
<v Speaker 1>Logo's basically means something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means something like heroic </v>

166
00:09:58.321 --> 00:10:03.030
<v Speaker 1>confrontation with the unknown and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>communication of the results thereof.</v>

167
00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:04.590
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means roughly that.</v>

168
00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:05.933
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christians did was assimilate Christ to </v>

169
00:10:09.991 --> 00:10:12.420
<v Speaker 1>the logos that existed at the beginning </v>
<v Speaker 1>of time.</v>

170
00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:13.433
<v Speaker 1>It's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very strange idea and it's a kind of </v>

171
00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:19.170
<v Speaker 1>mystical or artistic insight that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult to,</v>

172
00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:20.483
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's difficult to understand how that </v>

173
00:10:21.691 --> 00:10:23.420
<v Speaker 1>idea could even happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

174
00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:27.450
<v Speaker 1>so in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the Christians did with the idea of</v>

175
00:10:27.451 --> 00:10:28.284
<v Speaker 1>logos by associating that with Christ </v>
<v Speaker 1>was to make Christ who's at redeemer </v>

176
00:10:32.371 --> 00:10:33.204
<v Speaker 1>figure into the same thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>generated order out of chaos at the </v>

177
00:10:36.541 --> 00:10:37.374
<v Speaker 1>beginning of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that part kind of puts them in </v>

178
00:10:39.151 --> 00:10:44.151
<v Speaker 1>the same conceptual class as horace and </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the same conceptual class as Marduk.</v>

179
00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:47.303
<v Speaker 1>And I'll tell you later that it also </v>
<v Speaker 1>puts them in the same conceptual class </v>

180
00:10:50.431 --> 00:10:52.710
<v Speaker 1>as Buddha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'll get to that story later.</v>

181
00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:53.963
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So also what that means is that there's </v>

182
00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:56.723
<v Speaker 1>an idea that that lurks latently in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity that the ideal person is </v>

183
00:11:03.361 --> 00:11:06.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly the person who accepts</v>

184
00:11:06.631 --> 00:11:07.464
<v Speaker 1>the necessity of death and rebirth as </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the redemptive process is </v>

185
00:11:10.591 --> 00:11:11.424
<v Speaker 1>identical to the thing that at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning of time called order out of </v>

186
00:11:13.951 --> 00:11:14.784
<v Speaker 1>chaos.</v>

187
00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:18.930
<v Speaker 1>It's a phenomenal conception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that I've tried to</v>

188
00:11:18.931 --> 00:11:19.764
<v Speaker 1>argue in a paper that no one's ever read</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the reason that Western culture </v>

189
00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:29.430
<v Speaker 1>is predicated on the idea that human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings have an unalterable divinity,</v>

190
00:11:29.431 --> 00:11:31.740
<v Speaker 1>which is basically the source of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>natural rights,</v>

191
00:11:31.741 --> 00:11:32.574
<v Speaker 1>is because it's predicated on the idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the individual consciousness </v>

192
00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:41.060
<v Speaker 1>partakes of the process that's capable </v>
<v Speaker 1>of pulling order out of chaos or capable</v>

193
00:11:41.431 --> 00:11:42.264
<v Speaker 1>of mediating between the two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if there's something that's </v>

194
00:11:44.041 --> 00:11:44.874
<v Speaker 1>literally divine about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that I also </v>

195
00:11:48.421 --> 00:11:53.421
<v Speaker 1>promote in this paper is that you all </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that because you act on it,</v>

196
00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:55.403
<v Speaker 1>like you accept the idea that that there</v>
<v Speaker 1>are natural rights and that people have </v>

197
00:11:58.421 --> 00:12:00.940
<v Speaker 1>individual rights and that they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>intrinsic value.</v>

198
00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:01.983
<v Speaker 1>You don't know why and you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>what that idea is predicated on from a </v>

199
00:12:05.651 --> 00:12:06.484
<v Speaker 1>metaphysical perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you do accept it and you do act it </v>

200
00:12:09.551 --> 00:12:09.820
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

201
00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:10.653
<v Speaker 1>And so to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what that means is you believe it </v>

202
00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:16.150
<v Speaker 1>whether you know it or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you can argue about that because you</v>

203
00:12:16.151 --> 00:12:18.550
<v Speaker 1>can argue about what it means to believe</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

204
00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:19.713
<v Speaker 1>But I tend to think that belief exists </v>
<v Speaker 1>in relationship to action rather than </v>

205
00:12:22.781 --> 00:12:26.350
<v Speaker 1>into in relationship to objective </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualization.</v>

206
00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:27.663
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's a very interesting </v>

207
00:12:29.561 --> 00:12:30.394
<v Speaker 1>little twist in the genesis story </v>
<v Speaker 1>because what happens when God makes man </v>

208
00:12:33.581 --> 00:12:35.950
<v Speaker 1>and woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is a very bizarre thing,</v>

209
00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:41.250
<v Speaker 1>is that he basically says that men and </v>
<v Speaker 1>women are made in the image of God.</v>

210
00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:44.620
<v Speaker 1>Now God in that particular story is </v>
<v Speaker 1>plural,</v>

211
00:12:44.621 --> 00:12:47.560
<v Speaker 1>but that's not really relevant to our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to our concerns.</v>

212
00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:50.890
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's remarkable in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>variety of ways because number one,</v>

213
00:12:50.891 --> 00:12:53.410
<v Speaker 1>while we don't exactly know what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>image of God means,</v>

214
00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:58.060
<v Speaker 1>but we can place that in relationship to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that it was the word of God,</v>

215
00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:00.880
<v Speaker 1>that that extracted order out of chaos.</v>

216
00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:01.713
<v Speaker 1>And so what that seems to intimate is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's the capacity of the human </v>

217
00:13:06.911 --> 00:13:11.911
<v Speaker 1>being to extract order from chaos that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>equivalent to divinity,</v>

218
00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:15.610
<v Speaker 1>perhaps in a reduced form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that's A.</v>

219
00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:19.300
<v Speaker 1>I think we believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that we believe that.</v>

220
00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:22.450
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's right even worse than </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

221
00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:26.320
<v Speaker 1>And then the other thing that's so damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>bizarre about that is it's not just men,</v>

222
00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:30.110
<v Speaker 1>it's women too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

223
00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:31.193
<v Speaker 1>that's something that I have very </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult time accounting for because I </v>

224
00:13:33.371 --> 00:13:34.204
<v Speaker 1>don't understand why society that was as</v>
<v Speaker 1>deeply patriarchal as say the ancient </v>

225
00:13:40.901 --> 00:13:43.690
<v Speaker 1>Jewish society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why in the world that,</v>

226
00:13:43.691 --> 00:13:46.880
<v Speaker 1>that would also be attributed to women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it is anyway.</v>

227
00:13:46.881 --> 00:13:48.000
<v Speaker 1>So it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

228
00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:48.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

229
00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:49.533
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

230
00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:53.170
<v Speaker 1>the identity with God is equally </v>
<v Speaker 1>distributed between men and women.</v>

231
00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:55.780
<v Speaker 1>So that's quite cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

232
00:13:55.781 --> 00:13:57.910
<v Speaker 1>back to rabbi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Jack.</v>

233
00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:02.970
<v Speaker 1>More marmer Stein,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he describes tail as the unfathomable,</v>

234
00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:05.163
<v Speaker 1>undifferentiated womb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of which existence as we experience </v>

235
00:14:08.351 --> 00:14:09.184
<v Speaker 1>it emerges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All potential exists in this primordial </v>

236
00:14:13.301 --> 00:14:17.050
<v Speaker 1>energy or state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So its potential.</v>

237
00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:20.380
<v Speaker 1>So in some sense that's what the chaos </v>
<v Speaker 1>has potential.</v>

238
00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:21.423
<v Speaker 1>And so I've been thinking about that for</v>
<v Speaker 1>a long time too because it seems to me </v>

239
00:14:23.831 --> 00:14:26.290
<v Speaker 1>that what people actually interact with </v>
<v Speaker 1>his potential,</v>

240
00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:28.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we think we interact with matter,</v>

241
00:14:28.991 --> 00:14:31.930
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think we do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we interact with all the various</v>

242
00:14:31.931 --> 00:14:34.600
<v Speaker 1>possibilities that matter might </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifest.</v>

243
00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:35.673
<v Speaker 1>And that's not the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that when you're interfacing with </v>

244
00:14:38.591 --> 00:14:42.430
<v Speaker 1>your existence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing is taking a very large</v>

245
00:14:42.431 --> 00:14:43.264
<v Speaker 1>number of potential futures which are </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically laid out in front of you and </v>

246
00:14:47.081 --> 00:14:51.950
<v Speaker 1>actualizing one or the other as a matter</v>
<v Speaker 1>your choice,</v>

247
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:55.970
<v Speaker 1>and so I think the thing you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>interacting with isn't matter.</v>

248
00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:56.953
<v Speaker 1>It's the multiple potential states that </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter could manifest itself yet and I </v>

249
00:15:00.801 --> 00:15:01.634
<v Speaker 1>think that's what we call potential and </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness seems to collapse that </v>

250
00:15:04.581 --> 00:15:08.540
<v Speaker 1>into an act into into actuality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

251
00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:13.690
<v Speaker 1>all potential exists in this primordial </v>
<v Speaker 1>energy or state.</v>

252
00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:15.340
<v Speaker 1>Metaphorically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a confused.</v>

253
00:15:15.341 --> 00:15:16.960
<v Speaker 1>See the mask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the abyss,</v>

254
00:15:16.961 --> 00:15:17.794
<v Speaker 1>the deep and the surging bellowing of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the waves toe who similarity is a </v>

255
00:15:23.501 --> 00:15:24.334
<v Speaker 1>chaotic condition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So That's interesting because there's a </v>

256
00:15:26.321 --> 00:15:27.154
<v Speaker 1>psychological element there or a place </v>
<v Speaker 1>without color or form or more </v>

257
00:15:32.591 --> 00:15:37.480
<v Speaker 1>specifically something that seems to for</v>
<v Speaker 1>a moment to have form,</v>

258
00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:43.100
<v Speaker 1>but when looked at again loses that form</v>
<v Speaker 1>total.</v>

259
00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:43.973
<v Speaker 1>Who is this subjective effect of chaos?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The forest that confounds people and </v>

260
00:15:48.161 --> 00:15:50.590
<v Speaker 1>that causes them to have misleading </v>
<v Speaker 1>visions.</v>

261
00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:54.160
<v Speaker 1>So it's very psychological in nature </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that particular concept.</v>

262
00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:57.070
<v Speaker 1>And then Vrbo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who finally is related to Tau,</v>

263
00:15:57.071 --> 00:15:58.720
<v Speaker 1>who I'm sure I'm pronouncing those </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>

264
00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:03.190
<v Speaker 1>but means more specifically the </v>
<v Speaker 1>indistinct entangled,</v>

265
00:16:03.191 --> 00:16:04.024
<v Speaker 1>confused mass that all forms once were </v>
<v Speaker 1>prior to their division into separate </v>

266
00:16:08.441 --> 00:16:13.441
<v Speaker 1>kinds of objects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

267
00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:26.990
<v Speaker 1>the heavens and the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so those are the next elements out,</v>

268
00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:28.543
<v Speaker 1>apart from the chaos comprise the vast </v>
<v Speaker 1>and spiritually stunning places that </v>

269
00:16:31.401 --> 00:16:32.234
<v Speaker 1>rise above us as well as the material </v>
<v Speaker 1>domain that makes up our physical being </v>

270
00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:36.463
<v Speaker 1>and the physical being of those things </v>
<v Speaker 1>we experience this material domain is </v>

271
00:16:40.371 --> 00:16:41.204
<v Speaker 1>both a trap in which our consciousnesses</v>
<v Speaker 1>are caught and the a prior precondition </v>

272
00:16:45.961 --> 00:16:48.890
<v Speaker 1>for individual existence and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>destructive and vulnerable,</v>

273
00:16:48.891 --> 00:16:49.724
<v Speaker 1>but potentially redemptive aspects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The creation narrative in genesis has </v>

274
00:16:53.541 --> 00:16:57.950
<v Speaker 1>deeply embedded within it the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the materiality of the world clothes,</v>

275
00:16:58.160 --> 00:16:58.993
<v Speaker 1>partial beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>incomplete avatars of God whose purpose </v>

276
00:17:02.961 --> 00:17:03.794
<v Speaker 1>is the continuation and potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfection of the incompletely manifest </v>

277
00:17:07.131 --> 00:17:09.440
<v Speaker 1>being characterizing the original </v>
<v Speaker 1>creation.</v>

278
00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:12.320
<v Speaker 1>This process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

279
00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:13.183
<v Speaker 1>that's the process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we've got the order and we've got </v>

280
00:17:15.051 --> 00:17:16.850
<v Speaker 1>the chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now we've got the process.</v>

281
00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:20.900
<v Speaker 1>The process creation is characterized by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the second word in genesis,</v>

282
00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:21.853
<v Speaker 1>which is Barbara.</v>
<v Speaker 1>According to the cabalist aiden Stein </v>

283
00:17:24.951 --> 00:17:25.784
<v Speaker 1>celts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the creation represented by Barbra is </v>

284
00:17:29.151 --> 00:17:31.880
<v Speaker 1>not the coming into existence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>something new,</v>

285
00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:33.553
<v Speaker 1>but the transmutation of a divine and </v>
<v Speaker 1>illimitable reality in some into </v>

286
00:17:38.451 --> 00:17:42.830
<v Speaker 1>something defined and delimited </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularized and actualized.</v>

287
00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:47.060
<v Speaker 1>This analysis of Barbara seems very </v>
<v Speaker 1>illuminating first because it attributes</v>

288
00:17:47.061 --> 00:17:50.280
<v Speaker 1>genuinely creative power to </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness and cognition,</v>

289
00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:53.910
<v Speaker 1>creative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the limiting and second because it seems</v>

290
00:17:53.911 --> 00:17:56.730
<v Speaker 1>so closely related to the Christian idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the logos,</v>

291
00:17:57.270 --> 00:18:00.690
<v Speaker 1>logos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the most remarkable of all,</v>

292
00:18:00.691 --> 00:18:01.524
<v Speaker 1>the ancient philosophical or theological</v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptions is a word with an </v>

293
00:18:04.471 --> 00:18:08.160
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily broad range of meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means our everything.</v>

294
00:18:08.161 --> 00:18:10.560
<v Speaker 1>Our modern word consciousness means </v>
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>

295
00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:13.830
<v Speaker 1>It means mind and the creative actions </v>
<v Speaker 1>of mind.</v>

296
00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:15.630
<v Speaker 1>Exploration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>discovery,</v>

297
00:18:15.631 --> 00:18:16.464
<v Speaker 1>reconceptualization reason and speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Logos is further something whose </v>

298
00:18:21.061 --> 00:18:21.894
<v Speaker 1>relationship to the mirror material is </v>
<v Speaker 1>so fundamental that the material does </v>

299
00:18:25.171 --> 00:18:29.460
<v Speaker 1>not really exist at all in its absence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

300
00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:33.990
<v Speaker 1>it is something whose workings are </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially redemptive,</v>

301
00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:36.810
<v Speaker 1>continuing and perfecting the process of</v>
<v Speaker 1>creation.</v>

302
00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:38.453
<v Speaker 1>It is generally transcribed in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christian tradition as the word and is </v>

303
00:18:40.891 --> 00:18:41.724
<v Speaker 1>closely identified with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>transcendental being of Christ as well </v>

304
00:18:44.611 --> 00:18:46.740
<v Speaker 1>as with the original creative force of </v>
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>

305
00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:50.850
<v Speaker 1>This is a very peculiar identification </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the perspective of strip tap,</v>

306
00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:51.743
<v Speaker 1>strict temporal logic because it is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>word of God that creates order out of </v>

307
00:18:55.981 --> 00:18:56.814
<v Speaker 1>chaos and that word is a phenomenon that</v>
<v Speaker 1>predates the birth of Christ from the </v>

308
00:19:00.001 --> 00:19:04.200
<v Speaker 1>temporal perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's all exceptionally.</v>

309
00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:10.210
<v Speaker 1>It's very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's exceptionally incomprehensible,</v>

310
00:19:10.411 --> 00:19:11.610
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally,</v>

311
00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:12.743
<v Speaker 1>it's an unbelievable matrix of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated ideas and one of the </v>

312
00:19:16.471 --> 00:19:21.120
<v Speaker 1>reasons I started to explore this was </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know I was very obsessed,</v>

313
00:19:21.121 --> 00:19:21.954
<v Speaker 1>as you all know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the dynamic struggle between </v>

314
00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:29.490
<v Speaker 1>essentially between Soviet communism and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the western Worldview,</v>

315
00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:32.790
<v Speaker 1>and if you're a rationalist and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>relativist,</v>

316
00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:33.893
<v Speaker 1>then basically what you have to proclaim</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that both societies predicated </v>

317
00:19:37.741 --> 00:19:38.574
<v Speaker 1>themselves on arbitrary axiom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so arbitrary descriptions of right and </v>

318
00:19:42.271 --> 00:19:43.104
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that basically what was happening </v>

319
00:19:44.431 --> 00:19:48.330
<v Speaker 1>was that there was a war to see which of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those arbitrary systems would dominate.</v>

320
00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:50.220
<v Speaker 1>But I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

321
00:19:50.221 --> 00:19:53.820
<v Speaker 1>if it's just a matter of arbitrary ness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we're really in trouble.</v>

322
00:19:53.821 --> 00:19:55.740
<v Speaker 1>Because the only way you could pause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

323
00:19:55.741 --> 00:19:59.580
<v Speaker 1>neither of those systems are right or </v>
<v Speaker 1>better in any real sense of the word.</v>

324
00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:00.623
<v Speaker 1>And second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only way that could be possibly </v>

325
00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:05.400
<v Speaker 1>settled is by brute force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then I thought,</v>

326
00:20:05.401 --> 00:20:06.234
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if I look into the origins of the </v>

327
00:20:07.861 --> 00:20:09.870
<v Speaker 1>ideas that are characteristic of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>West?</v>

328
00:20:09.871 --> 00:20:12.990
<v Speaker 1>We know where the bloody communist ideas</v>
<v Speaker 1>came from because they were written down</v>

329
00:20:12.991 --> 00:20:14.640
<v Speaker 1>by marks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty obvious,</v>

330
00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:18.420
<v Speaker 1>but the ideas of things like natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights in the West,</v>

331
00:20:18.421 --> 00:20:22.110
<v Speaker 1>they're very peculiar ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're obviously metaphysical ideas and</v>

332
00:20:22.111 --> 00:20:23.610
<v Speaker 1>then you might ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

333
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:24.833
<v Speaker 1>are those mirror arbitrary statements or</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's something deeper underneath </v>

334
00:20:30.001 --> 00:20:32.280
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's partly what led me back to</v>

335
00:20:32.281 --> 00:20:34.440
<v Speaker 1>the analysis of these texts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

336
00:20:34.441 --> 00:20:36.630
<v Speaker 1>because the idea has emerged out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>text.</v>

337
00:20:36.631 --> 00:20:40.380
<v Speaker 1>It's not like somebody just sat around </v>
<v Speaker 1>and thought the damn things up.</v>

338
00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:43.890
<v Speaker 1>They're very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very old ideas and it doesn't look to me</v>

339
00:20:43.891 --> 00:20:47.860
<v Speaker 1>like the matrix that they emerged out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was actually a matrix ideas.</v>

340
00:20:47.861 --> 00:20:52.210
<v Speaker 1>It was more like a matrix of behavior </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's over thousands and thousands of</v>

341
00:20:52.211 --> 00:20:53.044
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's when I started to </v>

342
00:20:55.301 --> 00:21:00.301
<v Speaker 1>understand that the conception of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual in the West is something like</v>

343
00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:03.820
<v Speaker 1>that which mediates between order and </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos.</v>

344
00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:05.680
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not merely a,</v>

345
00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:11.650
<v Speaker 1>that's an ontological statement rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>than a theoretical statement.</v>

346
00:21:11.651 --> 00:21:13.630
<v Speaker 1>It's a statement about the nature of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality,</v>

347
00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:16.390
<v Speaker 1>not about models,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

348
00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:18.011
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

349
00:21:18.011 --> 00:21:18.844
<v Speaker 1>I would add to that the fact that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't understand a damn thing about </v>

350
00:21:20.711 --> 00:21:21.544
<v Speaker 1>consciousness except that it clearly </v>
<v Speaker 1>exists and that it also seems to me to </v>

351
00:21:24.701 --> 00:21:27.440
<v Speaker 1>be phenomenally logically accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

352
00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:28.473
<v Speaker 1>when you guys are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're all in this situation right now </v>

353
00:21:30.581 --> 00:21:33.400
<v Speaker 1>and probably possessed by anxiety </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of it,</v>

354
00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:34.773
<v Speaker 1>as soon as you graduate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what emerges in front of you is a huge </v>

355
00:21:37.121 --> 00:21:39.610
<v Speaker 1>field of an map potential.</v>

356
00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:45.340
<v Speaker 1>And it seems to me that there's no other</v>
<v Speaker 1>way of saying that it's more accurate.</v>

357
00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:49.690
<v Speaker 1>So we could just assume that that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>what confronts you and what you're doing</v>

358
00:21:49.691 --> 00:21:50.524
<v Speaker 1>as you navigate your way through it in </v>
<v Speaker 1>one form or another is actualizing that </v>

359
00:21:54.491 --> 00:21:55.324
<v Speaker 1>potential into some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into some reality that you inhabit that </v>

360
00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:02.860
<v Speaker 1>is hopefully operating in accordance </v>
<v Speaker 1>with what you both need and want.</v>

361
00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:03.873
<v Speaker 1>But you certainly view yourself as at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least to some degree as a being that is </v>

362
00:22:07.091 --> 00:22:09.970
<v Speaker 1>capable of doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me,</v>

363
00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:11.073
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you assume that you can choose what </v>

364
00:22:12.161 --> 00:22:13.780
<v Speaker 1>you're going to do after you go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>university,</v>

365
00:22:13.781 --> 00:22:18.781
<v Speaker 1>like you don't have infinite choice and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems perfectly reasonable to presume</v>

366
00:22:19.521 --> 00:22:21.710
<v Speaker 1>that that's anxiety provoking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why wouldn't it be?</v>

367
00:22:21.711 --> 00:22:22.544
<v Speaker 1>We also know from the empirical research</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and unstructured future is hard on </v>

368
00:22:26.751 --> 00:22:29.120
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They produce stress hormones like mad if</v>

369
00:22:29.121 --> 00:22:30.650
<v Speaker 1>they don't know what they're doing or </v>
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>

370
00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:34.040
<v Speaker 1>if there's a lot of unexpected potential</v>
<v Speaker 1>lying around.</v>

371
00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:36.440
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

372
00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:41.153
<v Speaker 1>The fundamental story of the first part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Genesis is predicated on the </v>

373
00:22:43.741 --> 00:22:46.800
<v Speaker 1>assumption that chaos can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualized as a matrix,</v>

374
00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:49.470
<v Speaker 1>as something with a metaphorically </v>
<v Speaker 1>female aspect.</v>

375
00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:50.543
<v Speaker 1>A matrix by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a matrix is something out of </v>

376
00:22:53.191 --> 00:22:57.240
<v Speaker 1>which matter arises.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same word Matrix matter,</v>

377
00:22:57.420 --> 00:22:58.253
<v Speaker 1>mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are all the same words and one of </v>

378
00:23:00.271 --> 00:23:03.810
<v Speaker 1>the things that's very interesting about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the word matter is that we use it in two</v>

379
00:23:03.811 --> 00:23:04.644
<v Speaker 1>ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

380
00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:08.730
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's a reflection of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tohu wa Bohu divide.</v>

381
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:09.833
<v Speaker 1>One thing is things are made out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter and then the other thing is that </v>

382
00:23:12.841 --> 00:23:17.841
<v Speaker 1>things matter and part of the Old </v>
<v Speaker 1>Testament conceptualization of matter is</v>

383
00:23:18.451 --> 00:23:19.284
<v Speaker 1>that it's partly matter and partly what </v>
<v Speaker 1>matters and part of the Old Testament </v>

384
00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:27.033
<v Speaker 1>conceptually conceptualization of matter</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the world is made out of what </v>

385
00:23:31.221 --> 00:23:32.054
<v Speaker 1>matters.</v>

386
00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:33.443
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

387
00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:37.050
<v Speaker 1>and I again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's a metaphor.</v>

388
00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:38.153
<v Speaker 1>I think your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think your nervous system is actually </v>

389
00:23:39.961 --> 00:23:40.794
<v Speaker 1>set up in that manner because the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain reacts to the world is if it </v>

390
00:23:45.891 --> 00:23:46.724
<v Speaker 1>matters and since your brain evolved and</v>
<v Speaker 1>since we don't know any other way of </v>

391
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:55.100
<v Speaker 1>producing an entity that can adapt to </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality without evolution,</v>

392
00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:56.503
<v Speaker 1>then the fact that your brain evolved to</v>
<v Speaker 1>treat the world as if it matters would </v>

393
00:24:00.081 --> 00:24:00.914
<v Speaker 1>indicate that the reason for that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it matters and I don't see any </v>

394
00:24:04.651 --> 00:24:05.484
<v Speaker 1>way out of that argument so that because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the normal argument is the physical </v>

395
00:24:09.741 --> 00:24:14.030
<v Speaker 1>substrate is primary and anything that </v>
<v Speaker 1>matters is EPA phenomenal,</v>

396
00:24:14.031 --> 00:24:14.864
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the subjective or </v>

397
00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:16.913
<v Speaker 1>quality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't see any evidence whatsoever </v>

398
00:24:19.461 --> 00:24:20.294
<v Speaker 1>that that's how your brain is organized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think all the evidence suggests the </v>

399
00:24:22.611 --> 00:24:23.444
<v Speaker 1>opposite and that what you're first </v>
<v Speaker 1>attracted to what matters and then you </v>

400
00:24:26.301 --> 00:24:31.301
<v Speaker 1>parse it out into the world so till good</v>
<v Speaker 1>you try on tangling that,</v>

401
00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:34.810
<v Speaker 1>but I haven't been able to untangle it </v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

402
00:24:58.670 --> 00:24:59.503
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

403
00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:00.300
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

404
00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:02.280
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that is hard to Chris' point is that</v>

405
00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:03.373
<v Speaker 1>that meaning manifests itself that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why he's a phenomenologist </v>

406
00:25:07.251 --> 00:25:09.830
<v Speaker 1>because the root word of phenomenology </v>
<v Speaker 1>is famous thought,</v>

407
00:25:09.831 --> 00:25:13.610
<v Speaker 1>which means to shine forth and it's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>eight priority state.</v>

408
00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:15.230
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

409
00:25:15.231 --> 00:25:20.231
<v Speaker 1>I think that you can assimilate those </v>
<v Speaker 1>theories to ideas like the root,</v>

410
00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:23.123
<v Speaker 1>the ground of existence is something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like information rather than something </v>

411
00:25:25.981 --> 00:25:26.814
<v Speaker 1>like matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually not like matter because </v>

412
00:25:28.561 --> 00:25:30.940
<v Speaker 1>what's ever at the ground of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have no idea about.</v>

413
00:25:30.941 --> 00:25:33.750
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even act like matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very strange stuff,</v>

414
00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:39.270
<v Speaker 1>but I think it acts at least as much </v>
<v Speaker 1>information as it does matter,</v>

415
00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:52.320
<v Speaker 2>extreme limitation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the care that you care about,</v>

416
00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:58.900
<v Speaker 2>the things that go on that rebate </v>
<v Speaker 2>rebate.</v>

417
00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:02.573
<v Speaker 2>You mentioned that the only reason tutor</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if your mind is that your mind is </v>

418
00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:16.340
<v Speaker 2>limited and so it has a certain number </v>
<v Speaker 2>of calories and things like that,</v>

419
00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:21.950
<v Speaker 2>and as a result things matter more than </v>
<v Speaker 2>others and so it looks like so.</v>

420
00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:28.011
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

421
00:26:28.011 --> 00:26:28.661
<v Speaker 1>Well that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

422
00:26:28.661 --> 00:26:30.890
<v Speaker 1>that yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a reflection of the idea.</v>

423
00:26:30.891 --> 00:26:34.010
<v Speaker 1>That limited limitation has utility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

424
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:38.230
<v Speaker 1>and so that or that even that limitation</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a precondition for meaning or,</v>

425
00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:40.730
<v Speaker 1>or more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think limitation is a precondition for</v>

426
00:26:40.731 --> 00:26:41.564
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that lead me to </v>

427
00:26:43.951 --> 00:26:46.970
<v Speaker 1>conclude is that there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

428
00:26:46.971 --> 00:26:47.804
<v Speaker 1>there's a logic in that if there can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>be being without limitation and </v>

429
00:26:54.421 --> 00:26:55.254
<v Speaker 1>limitation producers tragedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then how is it possible to have being </v>

430
00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:05.550
<v Speaker 1>that's acceptable?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the answer to that is,</v>

431
00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:07.590
<v Speaker 1>well that's what the redemptive question</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

432
00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:10.440
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the route of morality.</v>

433
00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:11.483
<v Speaker 1>That the essence of morality is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>determine how to live so that you can </v>

434
00:27:14.551 --> 00:27:19.551
<v Speaker 1>have being with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with tragedy held in a band sufficiently</v>

435
00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:21.863
<v Speaker 1>so that the being is worth having.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a very tricky thing to do </v>

436
00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:26.363
<v Speaker 1>because of the tragedy is built into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>box and I think that what redemptive </v>

437
00:27:30.241 --> 00:27:31.074
<v Speaker 1>system's attempt to manifest portray </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are a form of discovery is how </v>

438
00:27:37.861 --> 00:27:38.694
<v Speaker 1>that human being could what its </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure is and part of it seems to </v>

439
00:27:43.111 --> 00:27:44.520
<v Speaker 1>have to do with truth.</v>

440
00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:45.923
<v Speaker 1>You have to confront the thing that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>tragic because otherwise you can't deal </v>

441
00:27:49.681 --> 00:27:51.150
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big,</v>

442
00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:52.373
<v Speaker 1>that's a huge part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to communicate the </v>

443
00:27:54.541 --> 00:27:57.540
<v Speaker 1>consequences of that to others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not all of it,</v>

444
00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:00.360
<v Speaker 1>but that's a big part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the logo part of it.</v>

445
00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:01.733
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to embody the logos </v>

446
00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:05.670
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

447
00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:06.983
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now I want to move from the initial </v>

448
00:28:12.061 --> 00:28:14.030
<v Speaker 1>part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the,</v>

449
00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:17.310
<v Speaker 1>the creation of something out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

450
00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:20.160
<v Speaker 1>The origins of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of order itself.</v>

451
00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:23.160
<v Speaker 1>I want to concentrate on the story of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Adam and Eve.</v>

452
00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:24.353
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I want to do that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think it's an unbelievably </v>

453
00:28:27.421 --> 00:28:31.140
<v Speaker 1>illuminating story in the same way that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Mesopotamian story is illuminating.</v>

454
00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:32.213
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's staggering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The degree to which the information in </v>

455
00:28:35.131 --> 00:28:37.830
<v Speaker 1>it has been compressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I think what happens,</v>

456
00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:39.210
<v Speaker 1>it's something like this.</v>

457
00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:41.873
<v Speaker 1>People are always telling stories about </v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing or another and they tell </v>

458
00:28:44.761 --> 00:28:45.594
<v Speaker 1>stories down the generations and I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens is that our stories are </v>

459
00:28:49.561 --> 00:28:54.561
<v Speaker 1>handed down across the generations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that remains of the stories is those</v>

460
00:28:55.231 --> 00:28:56.064
<v Speaker 1>elements that cannot be forgotten.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is that there's </v>

461
00:28:59.611 --> 00:29:00.444
<v Speaker 1>something centrally meaningful about </v>
<v Speaker 1>those elements because that's what you </v>

462
00:29:03.061 --> 00:29:04.770
<v Speaker 1>remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You remember what's meaningful.</v>

463
00:29:04.771 --> 00:29:08.850
<v Speaker 1>You get rid of what isn't right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I tell you the story of what I did</v>

464
00:29:08.851 --> 00:29:11.910
<v Speaker 1>today and you go off to someone else and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you retell the story,</v>

465
00:29:11.911 --> 00:29:12.744
<v Speaker 1>you're going to compress it down to just</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few lines and those are the few lines </v>

466
00:29:16.231 --> 00:29:18.870
<v Speaker 1>that in some sense seemed to sum up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire story.</v>

467
00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:22.410
<v Speaker 1>And that's the part you didn't forget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you might ask if,</v>

468
00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:25.920
<v Speaker 1>if a thousand people tell a story for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand years,</v>

469
00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:27.233
<v Speaker 1>what's left of the story and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>straightforward answer to that seems to </v>

470
00:29:30.061 --> 00:29:30.481
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

471
00:29:30.481 --> 00:29:33.840
<v Speaker 1>it's the part of the story that nobody </v>
<v Speaker 1>can forget and that would be the part of</v>

472
00:29:33.841 --> 00:29:35.850
<v Speaker 1>the story that's most richly meaningful.</v>

473
00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:37.500
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why precisely?</v>

474
00:29:37.501 --> 00:29:38.334
<v Speaker 1>It would be richly meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a whole different </v>

475
00:29:39.931 --> 00:29:41.890
<v Speaker 1>question and I don't really know how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer that.</v>

476
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:45.250
<v Speaker 1>I think to some degree it echoes in </v>
<v Speaker 1>people you know,</v>

477
00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:47.990
<v Speaker 1>it's like we don't understand that </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

478
00:29:47.991 --> 00:29:48.824
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go to a movie and the movie will </v>

479
00:29:50.051 --> 00:29:50.884
<v Speaker 1>reach a climax and all of a sudden </v>
<v Speaker 1>little it'll produce an emotional </v>

480
00:29:53.261 --> 00:29:54.370
<v Speaker 1>release in you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

481
00:29:54.371 --> 00:29:55.204
<v Speaker 1>maybe you'll start to cry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean you know exactly why </v>

482
00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:00.490
<v Speaker 1>it's something in you is responding to </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

483
00:30:00.491 --> 00:30:01.061
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

484
00:30:01.061 --> 00:30:05.260
<v Speaker 1>it's echoing in you in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might even say that the structure</v>

485
00:30:05.261 --> 00:30:09.580
<v Speaker 1>of the story comes to match the </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure of your caring.</v>

486
00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:10.553
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a mirror of your psyche in some </v>

487
00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:15.123
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

488
00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:16.743
<v Speaker 3>The proverbial Chinese telephone game </v>
<v Speaker 3>where you start with 10 people by the </v>

489
00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:24.320
<v Speaker 3>end,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's unrecognizable.</v>

490
00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:28.390
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that any meeting carry </v>
<v Speaker 3>through though.</v>

491
00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:34.540
<v Speaker 1>How do we know is is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

492
00:30:34.550 --> 00:30:35.460
<v Speaker 1>partly we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

493
00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:36.353
<v Speaker 1>we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are actual ways we do know that </v>

494
00:30:38.390 --> 00:30:41.120
<v Speaker 1>because there are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

495
00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:46.240
<v Speaker 1>what tends to happen in the historical </v>
<v Speaker 1>story is that it isn't change.</v>

496
00:30:47.571 --> 00:30:50.030
<v Speaker 1>That's the rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's its permanence.</v>

497
00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:51.523
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grizzly bears now in grizzly bears </v>

498
00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:55.310
<v Speaker 1>150,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

499
00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:59.540
<v Speaker 1>they are the same and roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the farther you go back in time,</v>

500
00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:02.630
<v Speaker 1>the more people are the same from one </v>
<v Speaker 1>generation to another.</v>

501
00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:05.360
<v Speaker 1>They don't change at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

502
00:31:05.361 --> 00:31:08.630
<v Speaker 1>among the Australian aborigines before </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Europeans came,</v>

503
00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:12.420
<v Speaker 1>there's not a lot of evidence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural transformation over 25,000</v>

504
00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:13.293
<v Speaker 1>year period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I don't think we really </v>

505
00:31:14.691 --> 00:31:19.070
<v Speaker 1>understand the degree to which a static </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture is actually static.</v>

506
00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:24.020
<v Speaker 1>The same thing just happens over and </v>
<v Speaker 1>over and the same stories are told and I</v>

507
00:31:24.021 --> 00:31:26.600
<v Speaker 1>don't think they're told in exactly the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same way as the,</v>

508
00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:30.110
<v Speaker 1>as the story or the game that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>describing.</v>

509
00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:31.273
<v Speaker 1>Because first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the knowledge is distributed to some </v>

510
00:31:33.471 --> 00:31:34.304
<v Speaker 1>degree in everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so even if you told a part of the story </v>

511
00:31:37.551 --> 00:31:38.384
<v Speaker 1>and you told it wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then someone else is going to correct </v>

512
00:31:40.071 --> 00:31:40.904
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the story's actually distributed </v>

513
00:31:42.321 --> 00:31:44.880
<v Speaker 1>throughout the entire society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

514
00:31:45.890 --> 00:31:49.850
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think it's nearly as fragile </v>
<v Speaker 1>as people assume now,</v>

515
00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:51.703
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously there are times in history </v>

516
00:31:53.391 --> 00:31:55.730
<v Speaker 1>where those things start to transform </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite rapidly,</v>

517
00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:01.000
<v Speaker 1>but I think that's what happens when the</v>
<v Speaker 1>population starts to grow and diverse,</v>

518
00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:02.233
<v Speaker 1>separated community start to come back </v>
<v Speaker 1>together and then the story starts to </v>

519
00:32:05.541 --> 00:32:07.190
<v Speaker 1>transform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But other than that,</v>

520
00:32:07.191 --> 00:32:11.330
<v Speaker 1>I think the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The a prior condition is stability,</v>

521
00:32:11.331 --> 00:32:13.550
<v Speaker 1>not transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we do know,</v>

522
00:32:13.551 --> 00:32:16.790
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a group of people on in northern</v>

523
00:32:16.791 --> 00:32:20.870
<v Speaker 1>Japan called the Ainu and God only knows</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they came from.</v>

524
00:32:22.010 --> 00:32:23.750
<v Speaker 1>There's all sorts of theories about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

525
00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:24.933
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things that's interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the a new is that they have a </v>

526
00:32:27.171 --> 00:32:28.004
<v Speaker 1>ceremony that involves the worship of </v>
<v Speaker 1>bears that seems to have exactly the </v>

527
00:32:32.061 --> 00:32:32.894
<v Speaker 1>same structure as the structures of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their worship that have been found in </v>

528
00:32:36.621 --> 00:32:38.900
<v Speaker 1>Neolithic caves in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in western Europe.</v>

529
00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:40.483
<v Speaker 1>So the way the bear skull is set up on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the altar and so forth is the same as </v>

530
00:32:44.061 --> 00:32:47.600
<v Speaker 1>the caves that were discovered in </v>
<v Speaker 1>western Europe even though there's a gap</v>

531
00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:50.420
<v Speaker 1>of approximately 25,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

532
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:51.943
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think that broken telephone </v>

533
00:32:53.811 --> 00:32:58.811
<v Speaker 1>analogy is quite right because that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the only sentence level first usually.</v>

534
00:33:00.170 --> 00:33:01.003
<v Speaker 1>And the only person who knows the </v>
<v Speaker 1>message to begin with is one person and </v>

535
00:33:04.821 --> 00:33:05.654
<v Speaker 1>there's no context for the message.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's an interesting analogy and I </v>

536
00:33:10.371 --> 00:33:11.204
<v Speaker 1>also think some of it's useful because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>do think stories transformed themselves </v>

537
00:33:14.361 --> 00:33:15.194
<v Speaker 1>across time to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even with the retelling because the </v>

538
00:33:17.751 --> 00:33:20.210
<v Speaker 1>language is going to shift and move and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so forth.</v>

539
00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:24.920
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think we should assume that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the default position is noise.</v>

540
00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:26.990
<v Speaker 1>I think we should assume that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>signal.</v>

541
00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:29.150
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

542
00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:31.633
<v Speaker 1>Adam and Eve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing that happens is that </v>

543
00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:42.783
<v Speaker 1>they were both naked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the man and his wife and were not </v>

544
00:33:44.411 --> 00:33:48.400
<v Speaker 1>ashamed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing you might ask is,</v>

545
00:33:48.730 --> 00:33:51.040
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is meant by naked and what is meant</v>

546
00:33:51.041 --> 00:33:53.560
<v Speaker 1>by a shaped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then you think,</v>

547
00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:54.783
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a number of things about people </v>

548
00:33:57.131 --> 00:34:02.131
<v Speaker 1>that are quite peculiar and one is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>were clothed and although there are some</v>

549
00:34:02.861 --> 00:34:03.694
<v Speaker 1>people who go about naked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the standard human position in </v>

550
00:34:07.301 --> 00:34:08.320
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

551
00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:12.753
<v Speaker 1>you can actually trace the the origin of</v>
<v Speaker 1>cloth using the evolutionary structure </v>

552
00:34:20.831 --> 00:34:25.240
<v Speaker 1>of lice because there are some who have </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolved to hold on to cloth,</v>

553
00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:30.250
<v Speaker 1>not hair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they've tracked the DNA development,</v>

554
00:34:30.251 --> 00:34:33.820
<v Speaker 1>the genetic development of those lights </v>
<v Speaker 1>back more than 25,000</v>

555
00:34:33.821 --> 00:34:37.510
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people will use cloth and they use it</v>

556
00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:39.790
<v Speaker 1>while they use it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously for production,</v>

557
00:34:39.791 --> 00:34:42.310
<v Speaker 1>but they also use it for all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolic routines.</v>

558
00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:43.173
<v Speaker 1>But the point is is that there it does </v>
<v Speaker 1>seem to be a particular human </v>

559
00:34:46.091 --> 00:34:46.924
<v Speaker 1>relationship with the idea of nakedness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you might ask yourself why and what </v>

560
00:34:54.071 --> 00:34:54.904
<v Speaker 1>does it mean that that the original </v>
<v Speaker 1>people might have be naked and not </v>

561
00:34:57.971 --> 00:34:58.804
<v Speaker 1>ashamed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And why would that be a surprise to the </v>

562
00:35:00.761 --> 00:35:02.800
<v Speaker 1>readers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because obviously one of the things that</v>

563
00:35:02.801 --> 00:35:03.634
<v Speaker 1>sentence presumes is that the reader is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to assume that the fact that the </v>

564
00:35:07.451 --> 00:35:08.284
<v Speaker 1>men and women who were naked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not ashamed is actually a </v>

565
00:35:10.301 --> 00:35:15.280
<v Speaker 1>deviation from the norm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's what I have made of it,</v>

566
00:35:15.281 --> 00:35:20.281
<v Speaker 1>and you can tell me what you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

567
00:35:20.831 --> 00:35:22.180
<v Speaker 1>they weren't self conscious.</v>

568
00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:25.830
<v Speaker 1>Now you might ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

569
00:35:25.831 --> 00:35:27.720
<v Speaker 1>what would that have to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>nakedness?</v>

570
00:35:27.721 --> 00:35:28.800
<v Speaker 1>And I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

571
00:35:29.010 --> 00:35:29.843
<v Speaker 1>a huge chunk of white people don't run </v>
<v Speaker 1>around naked is because they're self </v>

572
00:35:32.101 --> 00:35:35.730
<v Speaker 1>conscious and there's a bunch of reasons</v>
<v Speaker 1>for that is that,</v>

573
00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:38.760
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings are standing up,</v>

574
00:35:38.761 --> 00:35:41.340
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like unlike other animals,</v>

575
00:35:41.341 --> 00:35:42.174
<v Speaker 1>and so the most vulnerable parts of us </v>
<v Speaker 1>are exposed not only to the world but </v>

576
00:35:44.941 --> 00:35:45.774
<v Speaker 1>directly to the view of other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so most animals running around and </v>

577
00:35:48.891 --> 00:35:49.724
<v Speaker 1>all four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that means they basically have </v>

578
00:35:50.641 --> 00:35:52.080
<v Speaker 1>armored backs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

579
00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:53.093
<v Speaker 1>They're most vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Parts are not full center in front for </v>

580
00:35:56.270 --> 00:36:00.870
<v Speaker 1>for everyone to see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So human beings also make face to face,</v>

581
00:36:00.871 --> 00:36:01.704
<v Speaker 1>although they don't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that also heightened self </v>

582
00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:09.140
<v Speaker 1>consciousness and then in relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>to shame.</v>

583
00:36:13.690 --> 00:36:14.523
<v Speaker 1>Shame is actually a emotion that seems </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be manifested under conditions of </v>

584
00:36:18.101 --> 00:36:20.170
<v Speaker 1>judgment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you might say,</v>

585
00:36:20.171 --> 00:36:21.004
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are often afraid of public </v>

586
00:36:22.781 --> 00:36:23.614
<v Speaker 1>speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why you guys are afraid of public </v>

587
00:36:27.601 --> 00:36:28.434
<v Speaker 1>speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of you are afraid of public </v>

588
00:36:29.121 --> 00:36:32.040
<v Speaker 1>speaking?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

589
00:36:32.070 --> 00:36:34.710
<v Speaker 1>how many of you are completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>comfortable with public speaking?</v>

590
00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:35.881
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>

591
00:36:35.881 --> 00:36:37.290
<v Speaker 1>That's quite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's quite amazing.</v>

592
00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:38.670
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

593
00:36:38.671 --> 00:36:41.190
<v Speaker 1>so why might people be afraid of public </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking?</v>

594
00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:47.920
<v Speaker 1>You Bet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of eyes looking at you.</v>

595
00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:49.413
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And often people who are afraid of </v>

596
00:36:51.221 --> 00:36:53.530
<v Speaker 1>public speaking won't meet the eyes they</v>
<v Speaker 1>look down.</v>

597
00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:54.753
<v Speaker 1>And what that basically means is they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>reacting to the crowd as if it's a </v>

598
00:36:56.771 --> 00:36:57.604
<v Speaker 1>predator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The best way to overcome that is to </v>

599
00:36:59.651 --> 00:37:00.484
<v Speaker 1>start looking at people and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the crowd because there isn't a </v>

600
00:37:02.771 --> 00:37:03.604
<v Speaker 1>crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You look at individuals within the crop </v>

601
00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:07.450
<v Speaker 1>and then that's no problem because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know how to do that.</v>

602
00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:11.200
<v Speaker 1>So great way to decrease your fear of </v>
<v Speaker 1>public speaking.</v>

603
00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:12.273
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

604
00:37:12.610 --> 00:37:15.850
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how about speaking in front of a crowd?</v>

605
00:37:15.851 --> 00:37:18.790
<v Speaker 1>Naked?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a common nightmare by the way.</v>

606
00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:21.520
<v Speaker 1>So what do you think about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sounds like fun.</v>

607
00:37:22.130 --> 00:37:23.350
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

608
00:37:23.410 --> 00:37:26.320
<v Speaker 1>Why more scrutiny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

609
00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:28.390
<v Speaker 1>And so what's the problem with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>scrutiny</v>

610
00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:30.583
<v Speaker 2>it makes you so</v>

611
00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:31.453
<v Speaker 1>why</v>

612
00:37:33.410 --> 00:37:34.050
<v Speaker 2>secure?</v>

613
00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:34.883
<v Speaker 1>Why</v>

614
00:37:37.570 --> 00:37:38.403
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a lot of flaws and you're </v>

615
00:37:39.850 --> 00:37:41.530
<v Speaker 1>bloody well aware of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

616
00:37:41.531 --> 00:37:44.260
<v Speaker 1>and it's bad enough to have your </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual flaw is revealed,</v>

617
00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:45.633
<v Speaker 1>but to add to that your physical flaws,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know when you can think about that </v>

618
00:37:48.161 --> 00:37:50.530
<v Speaker 1>as your deviation from an implicit </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideal,</v>

619
00:37:50.531 --> 00:37:52.270
<v Speaker 1>it's something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

620
00:37:52.271 --> 00:37:54.910
<v Speaker 1>People don't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why you never,</v>

621
00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:55.953
<v Speaker 1>except for the naked news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you never see that happening or you </v>

622
00:37:58.391 --> 00:38:01.600
<v Speaker 1>virtually never see that happening </v>
<v Speaker 1>except under very specific conditions.</v>

623
00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:07.440
<v Speaker 1>So part of the issue with being naked </v>
<v Speaker 1>and ashamed is that the nakedness has to</v>

624
00:38:08.261 --> 00:38:10.870
<v Speaker 1>do with flaws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might say,</v>

625
00:38:10.871 --> 00:38:11.704
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does it mean to see yourself as </v>

626
00:38:13.571 --> 00:38:14.410
<v Speaker 1>naked?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

627
00:38:14.411 --> 00:38:18.340
<v Speaker 1>I think what it means is to see yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>with all your vulnerabilities and that's</v>

628
00:38:18.341 --> 00:38:21.730
<v Speaker 1>like your local vulnerabilities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which just happens to be how hideous you</v>

629
00:38:21.731 --> 00:38:24.730
<v Speaker 1>are as a physical entity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then there's even worse,</v>

630
00:38:24.731 --> 00:38:25.564
<v Speaker 1>which is if you're really self conscious</v>
<v Speaker 1>and aware of what it means to be </v>

631
00:38:28.751 --> 00:38:29.584
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable because let's say that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's at the core of nakedness is you </v>

632
00:38:32.291 --> 00:38:37.291
<v Speaker 1>also realize you're flawed mortal nature</v>
<v Speaker 1>across time,</v>

633
00:38:38.081 --> 00:38:38.914
<v Speaker 1>so that's partly the burden of the fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're physically imperfect in </v>

634
00:38:42.071 --> 00:38:42.904
<v Speaker 1>degenerating all at the same time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's something that human beings </v>

635
00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:48.520
<v Speaker 1>understanding that no other animal </v>
<v Speaker 1>understands.</v>

636
00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:51.970
<v Speaker 1>It's a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think partly the reason that we put</v>

637
00:38:51.971 --> 00:38:54.790
<v Speaker 1>on clothes is so we don't freeze to </v>
<v Speaker 1>death when it's cold,</v>

638
00:38:55.120 --> 00:39:00.120
<v Speaker 1>but part of it also is this to separate </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves from continual scrutiny.</v>

639
00:39:00.370 --> 00:39:03.130
<v Speaker 1>A lot of that's going to be sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>scrutiny to and evaluation.</v>

640
00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:07.600
<v Speaker 1>We shield ourselves from that so that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>can do some other things now and then.</v>

641
00:39:08.170 --> 00:39:10.690
<v Speaker 1>So the original people didn't have that </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>

642
00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:14.980
<v Speaker 1>so I think they weren't self conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the first thing to notice.</v>

643
00:39:15.310 --> 00:39:16.143
<v Speaker 1>So okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next thing that happens is that the </v>

644
00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:25.360
<v Speaker 1>outcome is complaining about the fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he doesn't have any company,</v>

645
00:39:25.570 --> 00:39:27.880
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So God does this,</v>

646
00:39:27.881 --> 00:39:28.714
<v Speaker 1>the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall</v>
<v Speaker 1>upon Adam and he slept and he took one </v>

647
00:39:31.661 --> 00:39:34.870
<v Speaker 1>of his ribs and closed up the flesh </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead thereof,</v>

648
00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:37.930
<v Speaker 1>and the rib,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which the Lord God had taken from man,</v>

649
00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:40.150
<v Speaker 1>made he a woman and brought her unto the</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

650
00:39:40.450 --> 00:39:41.283
<v Speaker 1>and Adam said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is now bone of my bones and flesh </v>

651
00:39:43.181 --> 00:39:44.020
<v Speaker 1>of my flesh.</v>

652
00:39:44.290 --> 00:39:46.960
<v Speaker 1>She shall be called woman because she </v>
<v Speaker 1>was taken out of man.</v>

653
00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:48.273
<v Speaker 1>So I want to read you something about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this because one of the interpretations </v>

654
00:39:51.251 --> 00:39:52.084
<v Speaker 1>of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially feminist interpretations of </v>

655
00:39:53.530 --> 00:39:54.363
<v Speaker 1>the story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that that makes women subordinate to </v>

656
00:39:56.981 --> 00:39:57.814
<v Speaker 1>men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it also inverts the natural order </v>

657
00:39:59.381 --> 00:40:03.190
<v Speaker 1>because obviously men come from women </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than women coming from men.</v>

658
00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:07.960
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea there is that that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like a patriarchal presumption</v>

659
00:40:07.961 --> 00:40:10.810
<v Speaker 1>that overthrew the original matriarchal </v>
<v Speaker 1>order,</v>

660
00:40:10.930 --> 00:40:13.120
<v Speaker 1>which there was none of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

661
00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:16.060
<v Speaker 1>that's a faulty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are anthropological theory.</v>

662
00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:18.820
<v Speaker 1>There was never a pre patriarchal </v>
<v Speaker 1>matriarchy.</v>

663
00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:20.560
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

664
00:40:20.561 --> 00:40:21.394
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a misplaced myth that says </v>

665
00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:28.180
<v Speaker 1>historicized because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the scheme that I showed you,</v>

666
00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:32.350
<v Speaker 1>the feminine is underneath the </v>
<v Speaker 1>masculine,</v>

667
00:40:32.351 --> 00:40:33.280
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

668
00:40:33.281 --> 00:40:36.430
<v Speaker 1>So in some sense the feminine nature is </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of that,</v>

669
00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:39.490
<v Speaker 1>out of which culture springs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's a psychological truth,</v>

670
00:40:39.491 --> 00:40:40.960
<v Speaker 1>not an anthropological truth.</v>

671
00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:46.200
<v Speaker 3>So the idea that backwards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea of the world,</v>

672
00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:53.850
<v Speaker 3>because if you're making one,</v>

673
00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:55.250
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>

674
00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:56.780
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

675
00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:59.180
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to read you why that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yes,</v>

676
00:40:59.181 --> 00:41:00.014
<v Speaker 1>it is exactly that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a reason for it and it has </v>

677
00:41:03.171 --> 00:41:04.004
<v Speaker 1>to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has to do with the idea that the </v>

678
00:41:05.901 --> 00:41:10.901
<v Speaker 1>central element of human being is logos </v>
<v Speaker 1>regardless of whether it's man or woman.</v>

679
00:41:13.610 --> 00:41:14.443
<v Speaker 1>Now logo says are also symbolically </v>
<v Speaker 1>masculine because it's associated with </v>

680
00:41:18.021 --> 00:41:21.440
<v Speaker 1>the heroic part of the individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let me read this because again,</v>

681
00:41:21.441 --> 00:41:24.350
<v Speaker 1>it's too complicated for me to conjure </v>
<v Speaker 1>up on the fly.</v>

682
00:41:24.770 --> 00:41:28.640
<v Speaker 1>So it is of course contrary to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire scheme of nature,</v>

683
00:41:28.641 --> 00:41:29.474
<v Speaker 1>that woman be derived for Matt and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>very tempting to read a simple </v>

684
00:41:32.421 --> 00:41:33.254
<v Speaker 1>patriarchal into that derivation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it is more appropriate to give </v>

685
00:41:37.131 --> 00:41:37.964
<v Speaker 1>these ancient and incomprehensible </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories the benefit of the doubt and to </v>

686
00:41:40.941 --> 00:41:45.770
<v Speaker 1>search for something more profound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Logos is symbolically masculine and that</v>

687
00:41:45.771 --> 00:41:48.930
<v Speaker 1>would be partly because of the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Martech against Matt,</v>

688
00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:49.813
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

689
00:41:50.570 --> 00:41:51.403
<v Speaker 1>There are diverse reasons for this that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have little to do with simple </v>

690
00:41:53.631 --> 00:41:56.480
<v Speaker 1>ideological prejudice or with gender per</v>
<v Speaker 1>se.</v>

691
00:41:57.140 --> 00:42:01.790
<v Speaker 1>The profound implicit idea put forth in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this creation sequence woman for man,</v>

692
00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:03.103
<v Speaker 1>is that the individual woman rather than</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mere female is a product of logos </v>

693
00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:11.720
<v Speaker 1>and not simply a daughter of matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>matter,</v>

694
00:42:11.721 --> 00:42:12.554
<v Speaker 1>mother or nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thus the story does not denigrate the </v>

695
00:42:14.871 --> 00:42:19.280
<v Speaker 1>female as is now commonly postulated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but elevates human being itself,</v>

696
00:42:19.281 --> 00:42:20.114
<v Speaker 1>man and woman above it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>simply material and symbolically </v>

697
00:42:22.551 --> 00:42:24.680
<v Speaker 1>feminine substrate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there's A.</v>

698
00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:26.720
<v Speaker 1>There's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was some.</v>

699
00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:27.763
<v Speaker 1>There was a whole series of ancient </v>
<v Speaker 1>writings that were uncovered in in the </v>

700
00:42:31.821 --> 00:42:32.654
<v Speaker 1>late 19 fifties that are now called the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gnostic gospels and hypothetically </v>

701
00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:42.790
<v Speaker 1>they're new testament gospels have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole variety of sorts that were,</v>

702
00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:48.620
<v Speaker 1>that were defined as non-canonical by </v>
<v Speaker 1>what became the Christian church,</v>

703
00:42:48.621 --> 00:42:51.200
<v Speaker 1>and so they were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all emerged in the late 19 fifties.</v>

704
00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:54.800
<v Speaker 1>It's a fascinating story because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who discovered them,</v>

705
00:42:55.070 --> 00:42:57.950
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been a long time since I read this.</v>

706
00:42:58.610 --> 00:43:02.720
<v Speaker 1>Their father had been killed by someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so they went out to find the guy who</v>

707
00:43:02.721 --> 00:43:03.554
<v Speaker 1>killed him and killed him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they went to a cave to burry </v>

708
00:43:06.310 --> 00:43:07.143
<v Speaker 1>them and when they dug into cave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they found all these amphora that had </v>

709
00:43:09.591 --> 00:43:10.424
<v Speaker 1>been buried for thousands of years and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they took them home and their </v>

710
00:43:14.271 --> 00:43:15.104
<v Speaker 1>mother used a bunch of the papers that </v>
<v Speaker 1>were inside them to light fires with so </v>

711
00:43:18.651 --> 00:43:22.070
<v Speaker 1>the family could cook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but an interior is dealer came along and</v>

712
00:43:22.071 --> 00:43:25.370
<v Speaker 1>recognize them for what they were and </v>
<v Speaker 1>squirreled them away.</v>

713
00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:27.290
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weirdly enough,</v>

714
00:43:27.291 --> 00:43:29.360
<v Speaker 1>and I don't remember how this happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>either,</v>

715
00:43:29.361 --> 00:43:30.194
<v Speaker 1>is that one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of these manuscripts called the </v>

716
00:43:33.351 --> 00:43:34.184
<v Speaker 1>gospel of Thomas made its way to Carl </v>
<v Speaker 1>young and he was the only person in the </v>

717
00:43:38.481 --> 00:43:39.314
<v Speaker 1>entire world who had access to any of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the gnostic gospels until probably 25 </v>

718
00:43:43.041 --> 00:43:46.040
<v Speaker 1>years ago when they were finally more or</v>
<v Speaker 1>less released to scholars.</v>

719
00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:49.610
<v Speaker 1>So that's also extremely bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

720
00:43:49.611 --> 00:43:51.200
<v Speaker 1>there's a quote from the gauze.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

721
00:43:51.201 --> 00:43:52.340
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very bizarre.</v>

722
00:43:52.341 --> 00:43:54.800
<v Speaker 1>It's a very amazing story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

723
00:43:54.801 --> 00:43:55.634
<v Speaker 1>there's all these gospels and now </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've been translated in various ways </v>

724
00:43:58.671 --> 00:44:02.510
<v Speaker 1>and you can buy them as the gnostic </v>
<v Speaker 1>gospels and the Gnostics were a group of</v>

725
00:44:02.511 --> 00:44:03.344
<v Speaker 1>early Christians who believed that </v>
<v Speaker 1>redemption could be attained through </v>

726
00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:10.940
<v Speaker 1>knowledge as much as redemption can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>attained through faith.</v>

727
00:44:10.941 --> 00:44:14.810
<v Speaker 1>And that was basically crushed by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>developing Christian church.</v>

728
00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:15.733
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>young is often regarded as a kind of </v>

729
00:44:18.051 --> 00:44:19.610
<v Speaker 1>gnostic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's still.</v>

730
00:44:19.611 --> 00:44:20.444
<v Speaker 1>It's really quite remarkable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he ended up with the gospel of </v>

731
00:44:22.281 --> 00:44:23.114
<v Speaker 1>Thomas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's just like an </v>

732
00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:27.950
<v Speaker 1>incomprehensible fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a similar idea.</v>

733
00:44:27.951 --> 00:44:32.280
<v Speaker 1>This individual woman rather than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mere female is a product of logos.</v>

734
00:44:32.281 --> 00:44:33.114
<v Speaker 1>And so there's an idea and the gospel of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thomas and similar ideas put forth in </v>

735
00:44:37.261 --> 00:44:40.380
<v Speaker 1>the gospel of Thomas in more thoroughly </v>
<v Speaker 1>elaborated form.</v>

736
00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:44.610
<v Speaker 1>Simon Peter said to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make Mary.</v>

737
00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:45.873
<v Speaker 1>So he's talking about the disciples and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mary Magdalene is in amongst the </v>

738
00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:50.153
<v Speaker 1>disciples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so Simon Peter stands to all the </v>

739
00:44:52.231 --> 00:44:55.140
<v Speaker 1>disciples,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make Mary leave us for females,</v>

740
00:44:55.141 --> 00:44:59.940
<v Speaker 1>do not deserve everlasting life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus said,</v>

741
00:44:59.941 --> 00:45:00.774
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will guide her to make her mail so </v>

742
00:45:03.001 --> 00:45:06.480
<v Speaker 1>that she too may become a living spirit </v>
<v Speaker 1>resembling you males,</v>

743
00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:10.380
<v Speaker 1>for every female who makes herself male </v>
<v Speaker 1>will enter the Kingdom of heaven.</v>

744
00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:13.200
<v Speaker 1>So the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what exactly does that mean?</v>

745
00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:14.880
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

746
00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:16.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can think about it.</v>

747
00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:20.850
<v Speaker 1>What do you think's happened since women</v>
<v Speaker 1>discovered the birth control pill?</v>

748
00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:25.080
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me fundamentally that what's</v>

749
00:45:25.081 --> 00:45:29.910
<v Speaker 1>happened is that many women have taken </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the attributes of masculinity.</v>

750
00:45:29.911 --> 00:45:30.744
<v Speaker 1>That's what they want because that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with freedom and exploration </v>

751
00:45:33.721 --> 00:45:34.590
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

752
00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:39.920
<v Speaker 1>and the kind of creativity that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with the mind rather than,</v>

753
00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:43.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to say mirror biological </v>
<v Speaker 1>creativity because it's not mere,</v>

754
00:45:43.981 --> 00:45:46.110
<v Speaker 1>it's important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>

755
00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:49.410
<v Speaker 1>It's not of the essence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness,</v>

756
00:45:49.411 --> 00:45:51.870
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or it's not of the essence of spirit.</v>

757
00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:53.153
<v Speaker 1>And so I don't think that the birth </v>
<v Speaker 1>control pill could have even come about </v>

758
00:45:57.121 --> 00:45:57.954
<v Speaker 1>as a possibility if there wasn't the </v>
<v Speaker 1>lingering idea in western culture that </v>

759
00:46:02.610 --> 00:46:06.600
<v Speaker 1>attributing to women the same spiritual </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenology.</v>

760
00:46:06.601 --> 00:46:09.960
<v Speaker 1>That or abilities that characterize men </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't the possibility.</v>

761
00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:11.513
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you might say women were </v>

762
00:46:14.131 --> 00:46:17.370
<v Speaker 1>emancipated because of the pill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you might say,</v>

763
00:46:17.610 --> 00:46:18.443
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what were the preconditions that would </v>

764
00:46:19.321 --> 00:46:23.370
<v Speaker 1>allow a society to do something as </v>
<v Speaker 1>radical as to invent the pill?</v>

765
00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:25.073
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously one of the preconditions was </v>

766
00:46:26.581 --> 00:46:27.414
<v Speaker 1>that there was enough of an agreement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>implicit agreement among the scientific </v>

767
00:46:30.481 --> 00:46:31.314
<v Speaker 1>community that the idea of allowing </v>
<v Speaker 1>women voluntary control over their own </v>

768
00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:39.270
<v Speaker 1>reproductive status wasn't the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>heresy that should have been punished by</v>

769
00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:40.343
<v Speaker 1>like instant death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even even even though that idea was </v>

770
00:46:44.101 --> 00:46:44.934
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was still a huge battle and still </v>

771
00:46:46.381 --> 00:46:47.214
<v Speaker 1>is between Catholicism roughly speaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Western world and the idea of </v>

772
00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:52.823
<v Speaker 1>birth control because it's still part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Catholic dogma that if you're a good </v>

773
00:46:55.411 --> 00:46:56.640
<v Speaker 1>Catholic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't do that.</v>

774
00:46:56.850 --> 00:46:58.830
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know if you know this or </v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

775
00:46:58.831 --> 00:47:03.831
<v Speaker 1>but you know that I'm generally women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women have a menstrual period about once</v>

776
00:47:04.621 --> 00:47:06.450
<v Speaker 1>every 28 days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

777
00:47:06.451 --> 00:47:07.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's built in.</v>

778
00:47:07.710 --> 00:47:08.543
<v Speaker 1>That was built into almost all </v>
<v Speaker 1>formulations of the birth control pill </v>

779
00:47:11.491 --> 00:47:15.750
<v Speaker 1>even though it wasn't necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the guy who invented the pale decided</v>

780
00:47:15.751 --> 00:47:19.920
<v Speaker 1>that it would be three weeks on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one week off so that the menstrual cycle</v>

781
00:47:19.921 --> 00:47:20.754
<v Speaker 1>would stay in tact so that it wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>look as much like a deviation from the </v>

782
00:47:23.101 --> 00:47:27.240
<v Speaker 1>natural order to all those people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are opposed to birth control.</v>

783
00:47:27.570 --> 00:47:28.403
<v Speaker 1>When the simple matter is is you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>take birth control all the time and </v>

784
00:47:30.431 --> 00:47:33.340
<v Speaker 1>never have a menstrual period and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't a problem or it's,</v>

785
00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:35.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it has to happen now and then,</v>

786
00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:36.213
<v Speaker 1>but it certainly doesn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have to happen on a weekly basis or a </v>

787
00:47:38.321 --> 00:47:39.250
<v Speaker 1>monthly basis.</v>

788
00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:40.533
<v Speaker 1>So you believed in the 19 fifties he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this phenomena that occurred in </v>

789
00:47:45.161 --> 00:47:46.450
<v Speaker 1>Catholicism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

790
00:47:46.451 --> 00:47:47.284
<v Speaker 1>which I don't understand very well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but part of the idea was that there was </v>

791
00:47:50.201 --> 00:47:51.034
<v Speaker 1>a shift in Catholic Dogma in the mid </v>
<v Speaker 1>fifties and because there was a </v>

792
00:47:54.281 --> 00:47:56.920
<v Speaker 1>tremendous movement in the Catholic </v>
<v Speaker 1>world to,</v>

793
00:47:57.250 --> 00:48:00.420
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to appreciate Mary as a Daddy,</v>

794
00:48:00.490 --> 00:48:04.780
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking along with Christ and </v>
<v Speaker 1>God and the Holy Ghost.</v>

795
00:48:04.781 --> 00:48:09.400
<v Speaker 1>So it was as if Mary was being added as </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fourth part of the trinity.</v>

796
00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:10.773
<v Speaker 1>And it wasn't a movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't an idea that the aristocracy </v>

797
00:48:15.191 --> 00:48:18.870
<v Speaker 1>of the church imposed on the masses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was exactly the other way around.</v>

798
00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:22.570
<v Speaker 1>The idea that Mary was to be uplifted </v>
<v Speaker 1>into heaven,</v>

799
00:48:22.571 --> 00:48:23.404
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so she would be beside God and Christ </v>

800
00:48:25.601 --> 00:48:26.434
<v Speaker 1>was an idea that was really popular in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Mediterranean countries and also in </v>

801
00:48:30.101 --> 00:48:32.750
<v Speaker 1>central and South America where we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>married.</v>

802
00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:33.593
<v Speaker 1>Worship is a huge element of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity and what happened was </v>

803
00:48:35.891 --> 00:48:36.724
<v Speaker 1>because of that popular pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Catholic aristocracy announced </v>

804
00:48:41.261 --> 00:48:42.094
<v Speaker 1>berries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is where I haven't got the </v>

805
00:48:43.121 --> 00:48:43.954
<v Speaker 1>terminology exactly right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her ascension into heaven in the mid 19 </v>

806
00:48:47.111 --> 00:48:47.944
<v Speaker 1>fifties and you believe that that idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>was movement in the collective </v>

807
00:48:52.931 --> 00:48:56.330
<v Speaker 1>unconscious and the movement was that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>

808
00:48:56.520 --> 00:48:57.353
<v Speaker 1>The imagination of the western world had</v>
<v Speaker 1>progressed to the point where it was </v>

809
00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:05.230
<v Speaker 1>self evident that there was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That their feminine element of being was</v>

810
00:49:05.231 --> 00:49:06.064
<v Speaker 1>underrepresented in the idea of daddy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that it needed to be elaborated up </v>

811
00:49:09.071 --> 00:49:12.100
<v Speaker 1>with all of the other mostly masculine </v>
<v Speaker 1>symbols.</v>

812
00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:13.233
<v Speaker 1>And then he would have read that as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>precursor to the possibility that the </v>

813
00:49:16.571 --> 00:49:17.404
<v Speaker 1>pill could have even become a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>An idea like the underlying imagination </v>

814
00:49:21.221 --> 00:49:22.054
<v Speaker 1>had to be arranged to allow that to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility before any of that research </v>

815
00:49:25.361 --> 00:49:29.650
<v Speaker 1>could have even been conducted much less</v>
<v Speaker 1>the product be sold,</v>

816
00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:31.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you have to,</v>

817
00:49:31.250 --> 00:49:32.083
<v Speaker 1>you got to think how bloody much </v>
<v Speaker 1>preparation does it take for a culture </v>

818
00:49:36.250 --> 00:49:41.250
<v Speaker 1>to allow a birth control device to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>sold for general use.</v>

819
00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:44.620
<v Speaker 1>It's not like that happens just because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's invented.</v>

820
00:49:44.621 --> 00:49:45.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forget that,</v>

821
00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:47.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still.</v>

822
00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:52.200
<v Speaker 1>People have by no means yet come to </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms with that.</v>

823
00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:53.513
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

824
00:50:02.550 --> 00:50:05.160
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you the last,</v>

825
00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:08.400
<v Speaker 1>the next part of this story and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll start until next week.</v>

826
00:50:09.060 --> 00:50:09.893
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Lord God took the man and put </v>

827
00:50:12.511 --> 00:50:15.210
<v Speaker 1>him into the garden of Eden to dress it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and keep it.</v>

828
00:50:15.390 --> 00:50:16.223
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's an interesting idea I think </v>

829
00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:18.660
<v Speaker 1>because.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what?</v>

830
00:50:18.661 --> 00:50:19.494
<v Speaker 1>It's now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what the story is proposing is that </v>

831
00:50:21.211 --> 00:50:22.044
<v Speaker 1>there's a universal habitation for </v>
<v Speaker 1>mankind and the universal habitation is </v>

832
00:50:26.041 --> 00:50:26.874
<v Speaker 1>the idea of the garden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now Eden means well watered place and </v>

833
00:50:31.671 --> 00:50:32.504
<v Speaker 1>Paradise means it's from paradigm means </v>
<v Speaker 1>a walled enclosure so that the original </v>

834
00:50:38.481 --> 00:50:41.380
<v Speaker 1>garden is a walled enclosure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's well watered.</v>

835
00:50:41.740 --> 00:50:43.730
<v Speaker 1>Then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what exactly is a garden?</v>

836
00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:48.200
<v Speaker 1>And it seems to me that a garden is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>productive union of nature and culture,</v>

837
00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:51.350
<v Speaker 1>so it's another order and chaos union,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

838
00:50:51.351 --> 00:50:55.580
<v Speaker 1>So a perfect garden is beautiful because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's natural,</v>

839
00:50:55.581 --> 00:50:59.570
<v Speaker 1>but it's also beautiful because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>attended to and paid attention to.</v>

840
00:50:59.750 --> 00:51:02.000
<v Speaker 1>And a garden is also something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>productive,</v>

841
00:51:02.001 --> 00:51:04.310
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just chaotic wilderness.</v>

842
00:51:04.311 --> 00:51:08.060
<v Speaker 1>It's a place where you can live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea is that human beings have to</v>

843
00:51:08.061 --> 00:51:13.061
<v Speaker 1>live inside walled gardens and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a physical element to that which</v>

844
00:51:13.431 --> 00:51:14.264
<v Speaker 1>is true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's a metaphysical element </v>

845
00:51:16.550 --> 00:51:18.290
<v Speaker 1>to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that the,</v>

846
00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:23.920
<v Speaker 1>the environment of a human being is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>proper ad mixture of chaos and order and</v>

847
00:51:23.961 --> 00:51:26.330
<v Speaker 1>it has to be bounded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

848
00:51:26.830 --> 00:51:27.663
<v Speaker 1>And then there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a very interesting corollary to </v>

849
00:51:29.721 --> 00:51:30.554
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is tremendously </v>

850
00:51:31.581 --> 00:51:32.414
<v Speaker 1>interesting is that there's a snake in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the garden and that's an interesting </v>

851
00:51:36.441 --> 00:51:37.274
<v Speaker 1>thing because part of that is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognition that you can't have a place </v>

852
00:51:41.091 --> 00:51:41.924
<v Speaker 1>of bounded chaos and order that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>productive without having something in </v>

853
00:51:45.171 --> 00:51:46.910
<v Speaker 1>it that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's disruptive.</v>

854
00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:48.013
<v Speaker 1>There's no way of getting the </v>
<v Speaker 1>disruptiveness out and that's because </v>

855
00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:56.720
<v Speaker 1>imagine here's the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this has been discussed intensely in</v>

856
00:51:56.810 --> 00:51:57.643
<v Speaker 1>Christian theology because there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship between the snake and </v>

857
00:51:59.991 --> 00:52:00.824
<v Speaker 1>Satan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is something we'll talk about </v>

858
00:52:01.671 --> 00:52:04.250
<v Speaker 1>later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you,</v>

859
00:52:04.251 --> 00:52:07.190
<v Speaker 1>if you're surrounded by infinite </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential in some sense,</v>

860
00:52:07.191 --> 00:52:09.920
<v Speaker 1>and that's chaos and you try to wall off</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of it,</v>

861
00:52:10.820 --> 00:52:12.500
<v Speaker 1>you can't keep the chaos out.</v>

862
00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:13.813
<v Speaker 1>You can only keep it out partially in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense because it's going to come </v>

863
00:52:16.821 --> 00:52:17.654
<v Speaker 1>sneaking back in because you can't erect</v>
<v Speaker 1>a wall that's going to keep out all the </v>

864
00:52:21.591 --> 00:52:26.591
<v Speaker 1>potential from a designated safe place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you have to live in a garden,</v>

865
00:52:27.771 --> 00:52:28.604
<v Speaker 1>you're going to encounter snakes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a not even God himself can keep </v>

866
00:52:31.881 --> 00:52:32.714
<v Speaker 1>the damn snakes out of the garden </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's inevitable consequence of </v>

867
00:52:36.531 --> 00:52:39.230
<v Speaker 1>walling off a small section from the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the,</v>

868
00:52:39.350 --> 00:52:40.183
<v Speaker 1>from the whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let me see if I can give you an </v>

869
00:52:43.041 --> 00:52:43.874
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>

870
00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:51.590
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can think of a metaphysical example,</v>

871
00:52:51.591 --> 00:52:52.424
<v Speaker 1>which is you know you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>inhabit one of your conceptual </v>

872
00:52:55.101 --> 00:52:57.980
<v Speaker 1>structures and attempt to keep that </v>
<v Speaker 1>matched with the world.</v>

873
00:52:58.160 --> 00:52:58.993
<v Speaker 1>That's like a walled space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're saying these are the relevant </v>

874
00:53:02.061 --> 00:53:04.070
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the place that I can inhabit,</v>

875
00:53:04.310 --> 00:53:05.143
<v Speaker 1>but the fact of the matter is is that as</v>
<v Speaker 1>your walling off that little enclosure </v>

876
00:53:10.131 --> 00:53:10.964
<v Speaker 1>for you to inhabit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's dynamism all around you and the </v>

877
00:53:14.391 --> 00:53:15.224
<v Speaker 1>dynamism is going to affect the </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure of this limited place that </v>

878
00:53:17.901 --> 00:53:18.734
<v Speaker 1>you're attempting to inhabit and at some</v>
<v Speaker 1>point it's going to poke his head </v>

879
00:53:21.381 --> 00:53:22.214
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just can't seal something off from </v>

880
00:53:24.351 --> 00:53:26.490
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing is going to come back.</v>

881
00:53:26.491 --> 00:53:27.241
<v Speaker 1>Yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

882
00:53:27.241 --> 00:53:28.074
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that happens in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>genesis story is that the snake is </v>

883
00:53:32.041 --> 00:53:36.360
<v Speaker 1>actually something to which Adam and Eve</v>
<v Speaker 1>cannot not attend.</v>

884
00:53:36.510 --> 00:53:38.220
<v Speaker 1>That's the other thing that's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

885
00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:39.053
<v Speaker 1>So the snake pops up in what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially paradise and human being's </v>

886
00:53:42.361 --> 00:53:43.194
<v Speaker 1>attention to z immediately drawn to it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I would also say that's what human </v>

887
00:53:46.531 --> 00:53:48.180
<v Speaker 1>beings are like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

888
00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:49.073
<v Speaker 1>if we've walled off something and </v>
<v Speaker 1>attempted to make it perfect and secure </v>

889
00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:56.580
<v Speaker 1>and something pops up inside that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>unexpected and predatory and attractive,</v>

890
00:53:56.850 --> 00:54:01.080
<v Speaker 1>the first thing we're gonna do is be </v>
<v Speaker 1>automatically drawn to it and then if we</v>

891
00:54:01.081 --> 00:54:03.690
<v Speaker 1>interact with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it's going to do is to increase our</v>

892
00:54:03.691 --> 00:54:04.524
<v Speaker 1>consciousness and that is what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As human beings evolved because one of </v>

893
00:54:08.671 --> 00:54:11.100
<v Speaker 1>the things we know is that we call </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolve with snakes.</v>

894
00:54:12.090 --> 00:54:12.923
<v Speaker 1>We call involved with predatory snakes </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm lynn is bell has demonstrated </v>

895
00:54:17.491 --> 00:54:22.491
<v Speaker 1>that the acuity of primate vision among </v>
<v Speaker 1>very large and diverse range of primates</v>

896
00:54:22.711 --> 00:54:23.544
<v Speaker 1>is correlated quite highly with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>prevalence of predatory snakes in the </v>

897
00:54:26.251 --> 00:54:29.670
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the,</v>

898
00:54:29.790 --> 00:54:30.440
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

899
00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:34.020
<v Speaker 1>the genesis story draws this </v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendously complicated analogy.</v>

900
00:54:34.020 --> 00:54:36.960
<v Speaker 1>And one analogy is snakes give people </v>
<v Speaker 1>vision.</v>

901
00:54:37.230 --> 00:54:38.063
<v Speaker 1>And the other analogy is the snake is </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually representative of the chaos </v>

902
00:54:41.701 --> 00:54:42.534
<v Speaker 1>that surrounds every bounded order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it tells the story of </v>

903
00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:47.033
<v Speaker 1>psychological abstraction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that would be consciousness versus </v>

904
00:54:50.251 --> 00:54:54.390
<v Speaker 1>the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it overlays that on primate snake.</v>

905
00:54:54.570 --> 00:54:55.403
<v Speaker 1>And it's because it's the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same idea at two levels of </v>

906
00:54:58.861 --> 00:54:59.694
<v Speaker 1>abstraction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have the same reaction to </v>

907
00:55:01.771 --> 00:55:02.604
<v Speaker 1>unexpected things that occur in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>pristine environment as you're distant </v>

908
00:55:06.511 --> 00:55:07.344
<v Speaker 1>ancestors would have had to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>appearance of a snake and a place that </v>

909
00:55:09.481 --> 00:55:12.660
<v Speaker 1>they regard it as secure and use the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same damn circuits.</v>

910
00:55:12.990 --> 00:55:13.823
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing and one of the major</v>
<v Speaker 1>claims in the story of genesis is no </v>

911
00:55:17.851 --> 00:55:18.684
<v Speaker 1>gardens without snakes and so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the story is set up so that God tells </v>

912
00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:23.873
<v Speaker 1>men and women to ignore the damn snake </v>
<v Speaker 1>and not to pay any attention with it </v>

913
00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:28.350
<v Speaker 1>north,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to interact with it,</v>

914
00:55:28.351 --> 00:55:30.510
<v Speaker 1>and also not to eat the fruit of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tree,</v>

915
00:55:30.511 --> 00:55:32.760
<v Speaker 1>of the knowledge of good and evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we'll talk about later.</v>

916
00:55:32.761 --> 00:55:35.250
<v Speaker 1>But human beings don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

917
00:55:36.060 --> 00:55:39.180
<v Speaker 1>they interact with the snake and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>become self conscious,</v>

918
00:55:39.900 --> 00:55:40.733
<v Speaker 1>which is a catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's how it shown in the in the </v>

919
00:55:43.021 --> 00:55:43.854
<v Speaker 1>story as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as soon as human beings become self </v>

920
00:55:45.541 --> 00:55:46.374
<v Speaker 1>conscious,</v>

921
00:55:47.100 --> 00:55:50.460
<v Speaker 1>they get thrown out of paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can read it this way.</v>

922
00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:53.313
<v Speaker 1>We got so smart by paying attention to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the damn snakes that we figured out we </v>

923
00:55:56.021 --> 00:55:56.854
<v Speaker 1>were mortal.</v>

924
00:55:58.660 --> 00:55:59.493
<v Speaker 1>They drove cortical evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the evolution of the visual </v>

925
00:56:01.841 --> 00:56:02.674
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm not trying to reduce it to a </v>

926
00:56:03.761 --> 00:56:04.594
<v Speaker 1>unit dimensional phenomena,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the point is once you get cortical </v>

927
00:56:07.110 --> 00:56:07.943
<v Speaker 1>elaborated enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at some point you're going to discover </v>

928
00:56:10.211 --> 00:56:14.920
<v Speaker 1>time which we have discovered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and once you discovered time,</v>

929
00:56:14.921 --> 00:56:18.010
<v Speaker 1>you're going to discover one of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>boundaries and what are your boundaries.</v>

930
00:56:18.011 --> 00:56:18.844
<v Speaker 1>This is temporal boundary and that means</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you die and that sort of like the </v>

931
00:56:21.491 --> 00:56:23.630
<v Speaker 1>ultimate manifestation of self </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness,</v>

932
00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:24.753
<v Speaker 1>and then as soon as you know that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to die while you're not in </v>

933
00:56:26.921 --> 00:56:28.870
<v Speaker 1>paradise anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure,</v>

934
00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:30.033
<v Speaker 1>and then you have to start taking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to start preparing for the </v>

935
00:56:32.621 --> 00:56:33.454
<v Speaker 1>future in a self conscious manner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things that happens to </v>

936
00:56:36.551 --> 00:56:39.700
<v Speaker 1>add them once God catches them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after he's become self conscious,</v>

937
00:56:39.701 --> 00:56:42.340
<v Speaker 1>as God says to straightforwardly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well now you've done it.</v>

938
00:56:43.110 --> 00:56:43.943
<v Speaker 1>You know you've become self conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now will all you're going to be able to </v>

939
00:56:46.361 --> 00:56:50.680
<v Speaker 1>do for the rest of history is work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be condemned to work and</v>

940
00:56:50.681 --> 00:56:51.520
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

941
00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:55.000
<v Speaker 1>what's the definition of work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's easy.</v>

942
00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:56.583
<v Speaker 1>It's the sacrifice of the present for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the future and you won't do that unless </v>

943
00:56:59.981 --> 00:57:00.814
<v Speaker 1>you're self conscious because why the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hell would you prepare for the future </v>

944
00:57:03.700 --> 00:57:08.360
<v Speaker 1>unless you knew that it might consist of</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing but trouble and you know,</v>

945
00:57:08.390 --> 00:57:09.223
<v Speaker 1>genesis portrays that discovery as </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's absolutely fundamental </v>

946
00:57:13.091 --> 00:57:13.924
<v Speaker 1>to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the ground of human existence and </v>

947
00:57:16.050 --> 00:57:16.883
<v Speaker 1>it's only part of what it portrays.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we'll talk about some of the </v>

948
00:57:20.201 --> 00:57:23.080
<v Speaker 1>other details when we get together next </v>
<v Speaker 1>week.</v>

949
00:57:23.350 --> 00:57:25.900
<v Speaker 1>Now what I want to do is I want to tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>you this story.</v>

950
00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:30.850
<v Speaker 1>I want to show you how it relates to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>emergence of self consciousness,</v>

951
00:57:31.030 --> 00:57:31.863
<v Speaker 1>and that's the collapse of paradox.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's the same idea as the descent </v>

952
00:57:35.531 --> 00:57:36.364
<v Speaker 1>into the underworld.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the Bible in some senses a descent </v>

953
00:57:39.041 --> 00:57:39.874
<v Speaker 1>into the underworld and ascension story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's precisely that because it's a </v>

954
00:57:42.821 --> 00:57:43.654
<v Speaker 1>redemptive story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>History starts when people descend into </v>

955
00:57:47.411 --> 00:57:48.244
<v Speaker 1>chaos and the entire historical element </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Bible is part of the attempt of </v>

956
00:57:53.471 --> 00:57:54.304
<v Speaker 1>human beings to lift themselves out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the painful selfconsciousness that </v>

957
00:57:57.701 --> 00:58:02.110
<v Speaker 1>they've fallen into as a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>interacted with the snake and the fruit.</v>

958
00:58:03.220 --> 00:58:04.053
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
