00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.040
<v Speaker 1>Hello Vancouver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

2
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.600
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we have an interesting situation </v>

3
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.600
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.780
<v Speaker 1>obviously this is part two and a few of </v>
<v Speaker 1>you were here for what took place last </v>

5
00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.880
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to find a way to catch you </v>

6
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.200
<v Speaker 1>all up pretty quick on what took place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before we do that,</v>

7
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:58.310
<v Speaker 1>I thought it might make sense to talk to</v>
<v Speaker 1>you about where we are in this </v>

8
00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:03.271
<v Speaker 1>discussion and why it matters and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>matters not just for those of us on </v>

9
00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:06.661
<v Speaker 1>stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it matters very much for you all in </v>

10
00:01:06.661 --> 00:01:07.000
<v Speaker 1>the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The point is basically this,</v>

11
00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.560
<v Speaker 1>we've arrived at a place in history </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the sensemaking apparatus,</v>

12
00:01:11.561 --> 00:01:13.810
<v Speaker 1>that usually helps us figure out what to</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about.</v>

13
00:01:13.811 --> 00:01:16.780
<v Speaker 1>Things has obviously begun to come </v>
<v Speaker 1>apart.</v>

14
00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.330
<v Speaker 1>The political parties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>

15
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.500
<v Speaker 1>the university is journalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of these things have stopped making </v>

16
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.781
<v Speaker 1>sense and alternative sensemaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>networks have begun to rise.</v>

17
00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.850
<v Speaker 1>And the one that we ended up being a </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of seems to be beating the odds </v>

18
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.411
<v Speaker 1>with respect to staying alive and being </v>
<v Speaker 1>a vibrant part of the conversation.</v>

19
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.500
<v Speaker 1>But that depends on something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depends on our ability to upgrade.</v>

20
00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.930
<v Speaker 1>What we can discuss and navigate and Sam</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Jordan have run a foul of each other</v>

21
00:01:51.191 --> 00:01:52.690
<v Speaker 1>in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you all know,</v>

22
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.750
<v Speaker 1>and so our ability to upgrade the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation such that they're able to </v>

23
00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.400
<v Speaker 1>find common ground and for us to move </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward together is potentially very </v>

24
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.940
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A very important upgrade.</v>

25
00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.330
<v Speaker 1>Now that upgrade in the modern era </v>
<v Speaker 1>includes you all because our </v>

26
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.060
<v Speaker 1>conversation and your conversations are </v>
<v Speaker 1>all now linked through the Internet.</v>

27
00:02:13.061 --> 00:02:18.061
<v Speaker 1>So the ground rules for tonight involve </v>
<v Speaker 1>you not filming what takes place on </v>

28
00:02:19.151 --> 00:02:24.151
<v Speaker 1>stage tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is because what </v>

29
00:02:24.151 --> 00:02:27.751
<v Speaker 1>takes place on stage tonight has </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences and the freer that Sam and </v>

30
00:02:27.791 --> 00:02:32.791
<v Speaker 1>Jordan feel to use new tools to try out </v>
<v Speaker 1>positions that maybe they haven't </v>

31
00:02:32.791 --> 00:02:33.550
<v Speaker 1>explored before.</v>

32
00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.390
<v Speaker 1>The more likely we are to succeed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So please don't film,</v>

33
00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.630
<v Speaker 1>but that does not mean that we don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want you talking about what was </v>

34
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.630
<v Speaker 1>discussed here tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

35
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.191
<v Speaker 1>we're very excited to see what you all </v>
<v Speaker 1>make of this conversation and where it </v>

36
00:02:47.191 --> 00:02:51.781
<v Speaker 1>heads so in an effort to get you up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>speed on where we got yesterday.</v>

37
00:02:52.841 --> 00:02:57.841
<v Speaker 1>And I think the evidence is strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all felt and the discussion online </v>

38
00:02:58.121 --> 00:03:03.121
<v Speaker 1>suggests that we actually accomplished </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite a bit yesterday that we made </v>

39
00:03:03.121 --> 00:03:07.531
<v Speaker 1>headway in an effort to attempt to keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>that momentum going,</v>

40
00:03:07.681 --> 00:03:10.810
<v Speaker 1>but we're going to do is we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have sam and Jordon Steele,</v>

41
00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:15.811
<v Speaker 1>man each other's points from last night </v>
<v Speaker 1>so that you can hear what that sounds </v>

42
00:03:15.811 --> 00:03:15.880
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

43
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:16.180
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

44
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.610
<v Speaker 1>for those of you who have ever tried </v>
<v Speaker 1>steel manning,</v>

45
00:03:26.611 --> 00:03:29.280
<v Speaker 1>somebody point with whom you have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>severe disagreement,</v>

46
00:03:29.281 --> 00:03:33.420
<v Speaker 1>you know just how hard this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's give them some leeway.</v>

47
00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.430
<v Speaker 1>Sam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you be willing to start?</v>

48
00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:36.450
<v Speaker 1>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

49
00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:39.200
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

50
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.970
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first let me just make the obvious point</v>

51
00:03:44.971 --> 00:03:49.971
<v Speaker 3>that that probably isn't so obvious once</v>
<v Speaker 3>you take the time to put yourself in our</v>

52
00:03:50.101 --> 00:03:55.101
<v Speaker 3>shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just imagine how surreal it is for </v>

53
00:03:55.101 --> 00:03:59.400
<v Speaker 3>us to be who we are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Simply having a conversation about ideas</v>

54
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.300
<v Speaker 3>and to be able to put a date on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>calendar and have all of you show up for</v>

55
00:04:03.301 --> 00:04:03.860
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

56
00:04:03.861 --> 00:04:05.260
<v Speaker 3>it's just an amazing privilege.</v>

57
00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.940
<v Speaker 2>Thank you for coming out.</v>

58
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.960
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so here's what I think,</v>

59
00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.570
<v Speaker 3>Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things I'm getting wrong.</v>

60
00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.140
<v Speaker 3>I think that was grammatically correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe there's another note in there,</v>

61
00:04:23.141 --> 00:04:28.141
<v Speaker 3>but clearly I don't understand how </v>
<v Speaker 3>valuable stories are,</v>

62
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:35.640
<v Speaker 3>how deep they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how did the degree to which story is in </v>

63
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.500
<v Speaker 3>code,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not only the wisdom of our ancestors,</v>

64
00:04:38.501 --> 00:04:43.501
<v Speaker 3>but quite possibly the wisdom borne of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the hard knocks of evolution of the </v>

65
00:04:43.501 --> 00:04:44.650
<v Speaker 3>species.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

66
00:04:44.651 --> 00:04:49.651
<v Speaker 3>so there's no telling how deep the </v>
<v Speaker 3>significance of the information encoded </v>

67
00:04:49.651 --> 00:04:54.600
<v Speaker 3>in stories goes and there's a class of </v>
<v Speaker 3>stories that are religious stories and </v>

68
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.371
<v Speaker 3>their religious for a reason because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're dealing with the deepest </v>

69
00:04:59.371 --> 00:05:01.150
<v Speaker 3>questions in human life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're questions about what constitutes</v>

70
00:05:01.151 --> 00:05:03.040
<v Speaker 3>a good life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's worth living for,</v>

71
00:05:03.041 --> 00:05:08.041
<v Speaker 3>what's worth dying for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are things that if each individual</v>

72
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:15.390
<v Speaker 3>just thrust from onto the stage of his </v>
<v Speaker 3>own life not knowing where he is and </v>

73
00:05:16.421 --> 00:05:21.421
<v Speaker 3>tasked with figuring out how to live all</v>
<v Speaker 3>on his own or even in a collection of of</v>

74
00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.870
<v Speaker 3>others who are similarly unguided by </v>
<v Speaker 3>ancient wisdom,</v>

75
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:34.440
<v Speaker 3>this is not knowledge we can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can recapitulate for ourselves easily</v>

76
00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:39.751
<v Speaker 3>and so we we edit or ignore the these </v>
<v Speaker 3>ancient stories at our apparel at some,</v>

77
00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:48.070
<v Speaker 3>at minimum,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and some considerable risk because we </v>

78
00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.341
<v Speaker 3>don't know how much we don't really know</v>
<v Speaker 3>what baby is in the bath water and so we</v>

79
00:05:51.401 --> 00:05:56.401
<v Speaker 3>should have immense respect for these </v>
<v Speaker 3>traditions and the,</v>

80
00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.960
<v Speaker 3>this is well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this has yet to be discovered tonight.</v>

81
00:06:04.961 --> 00:06:09.740
<v Speaker 3>I'm still not quite clear about how this</v>
<v Speaker 3>links up with,</v>

82
00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:15.290
<v Speaker 3>with more metaphysical propositions </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the origins of these have certain </v>

83
00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:19.981
<v Speaker 3>of these stories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at minimum my criticism of religion </v>

84
00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:26.130
<v Speaker 3>because it tends to focus on the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>obvious case of a zero sum contest </v>

85
00:06:28.031 --> 00:06:33.031
<v Speaker 3>between religious dogmatism and </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientific open ended discussion is </v>

86
00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:40.590
<v Speaker 3>doesn't address this core issue of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>significance of religious thinking and </v>

87
00:06:41.591 --> 00:06:46.591
<v Speaker 3>religious narrative because I am,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the most part just shooting fishing </v>

88
00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.900
<v Speaker 3>in a barrel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>criticizing fundamentalists,</v>

89
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:55.300
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the kind of God that the </v>

90
00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.991
<v Speaker 3>fundamentalists believe in the God who </v>
<v Speaker 3>is an invisible person who hates </v>

91
00:06:57.991 --> 00:07:00.700
<v Speaker 3>homosexuals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously that's not the deep,</v>

92
00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:04.150
<v Speaker 3>the deepest version of these religious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this or this.</v>

93
00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:09.010
<v Speaker 3>This essentially what is a narrative </v>
<v Speaker 3>technology for orienting human life.</v>

94
00:07:09.011 --> 00:07:11.380
<v Speaker 3>In the cosmos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so maybe I'll leave it there,</v>

95
00:07:11.381 --> 00:07:13.360
<v Speaker 3>but that's I think what Jordan thinks.</v>

96
00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:21.910
<v Speaker 2>Thanks</v>

97
00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:24.720
<v Speaker 4>for use steel man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sam's point.</v>

98
00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.320
<v Speaker 4>How did you feel about his encapsulation</v>
<v Speaker 4>of yours?</v>

99
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:29.970
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm convinced.</v>

100
00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:30.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

101
00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:35.240
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

102
00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:36.960
<v Speaker 4>I got a couple of things to say about </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

103
00:07:36.961 --> 00:07:37.680
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

104
00:07:37.681 --> 00:07:40.530
<v Speaker 4>I think it was accurate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>concise,</v>

105
00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:45.640
<v Speaker 4>fair.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I also think that this is a more </v>

106
00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:50.121
<v Speaker 4>technical note in some senses that if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you ever want to think about </v>

107
00:07:50.121 --> 00:07:50.640
<v Speaker 4>something that's exactly what you have </v>
<v Speaker 4>to do,</v>

108
00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:56.030
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want to take arguments that are </v>

109
00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:57.561
<v Speaker 4>against your perspective and you want to</v>
<v Speaker 4>make them as strong as you possibly can </v>

110
00:07:57.561 --> 00:07:58.320
<v Speaker 4>so that you can fortify your arguments </v>
<v Speaker 4>against them.</v>

111
00:07:58.321 --> 00:08:00.630
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to make them weak because</v>
<v Speaker 4>that just makes you weak.</v>

112
00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:02.490
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

113
00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:07.520
<v Speaker 4>Sam and I are both scientists and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>really is the case that what scientists </v>

114
00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:11.121
<v Speaker 4>are trying to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think what we're actually trying </v>

115
00:08:11.121 --> 00:08:13.011
<v Speaker 4>to do in this conversation genuinely is </v>
<v Speaker 4>to try to find out if there's something </v>

116
00:08:13.011 --> 00:08:15.270
<v Speaker 4>that we're thinking that's stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

117
00:08:15.271 --> 00:08:20.271
<v Speaker 4>because when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I'm laying out the arguments that </v>

118
00:08:20.271 --> 00:08:23.481
<v Speaker 4>Sam just summarize so well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've tried to generate a bunch of </v>

119
00:08:23.761 --> 00:08:25.680
<v Speaker 4>opposition to them in my own </v>
<v Speaker 4>imagination.</v>

120
00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:29.280
<v Speaker 4>And the arguments I put forward are ones</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't undermine.</v>

121
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:33.090
<v Speaker 4>But that doesn't mean they're right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't mean that at all.</v>

122
00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:36.810
<v Speaker 4>And so if someone comes along who is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is certainly the case,</v>

123
00:08:36.811 --> 00:08:38.670
<v Speaker 4>if you're a scientist who's worth his or</v>
<v Speaker 4>her salt,</v>

124
00:08:38.671 --> 00:08:40.080
<v Speaker 4>if someone comes along and says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey look,</v>

125
00:08:40.081 --> 00:08:42.150
<v Speaker 4>you made a mistake in this fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 4>proposition,</v>

126
00:08:42.151 --> 00:08:43.230
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

127
00:08:43.231 --> 00:08:45.300
<v Speaker 4>great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That means I can make progress towards a</v>

128
00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:49.170
<v Speaker 4>more solid theory of being so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's what we're trying to do.</v>

129
00:08:49.171 --> 00:08:51.870
<v Speaker 4>And I do think it's working.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I thought that was just fine.</v>

130
00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:56.900
<v Speaker 4>Exactly dead on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I hope I can do justice to your </v>

131
00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:56.900
<v Speaker 4>position as so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

132
00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:01.401
<v Speaker 4>So to summarize Sam's argument briefly </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then I'm going to tell him lately </v>

133
00:09:02.101 --> 00:09:05.400
<v Speaker 4>that you guys know why he thinks I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

134
00:09:05.401 --> 00:09:07.050
<v Speaker 4>At what things I'm not taking into </v>
<v Speaker 4>account,</v>

135
00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:12.530
<v Speaker 4>so sam believes that there are two </v>
<v Speaker 4>fundamental dangers to psychological and</v>

136
00:09:13.861 --> 00:09:18.861
<v Speaker 4>social stability,</v>
<v Speaker 4>religious fundamentalism essentially on </v>

137
00:09:18.861 --> 00:09:23.391
<v Speaker 4>the right and moral relativism and </v>
<v Speaker 4>nihilism on the left and so the danger </v>

138
00:09:24.181 --> 00:09:29.181
<v Speaker 4>of the right wing position is that it </v>
<v Speaker 4>enables people to arbitrarily </v>

139
00:09:29.181 --> 00:09:33.351
<v Speaker 4>established certain revealed axioms as </v>
<v Speaker 4>indisputable truth and then to </v>

140
00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:38.390
<v Speaker 4>tyrannized themselves and other people </v>
<v Speaker 4>with the claims that those are divine </v>

141
00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:42.201
<v Speaker 4>revelations and he sees that as part of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the danger of religious fundamentalism </v>

142
00:09:42.201 --> 00:09:45.280
<v Speaker 4>and maybe religious thinking in general,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also as something that characterizes</v>

143
00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:48.810
<v Speaker 4>second or totalitarian states that also </v>
<v Speaker 4>has a religious aspect.</v>

144
00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:50.940
<v Speaker 4>So that's on the right and then on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>left.</v>

145
00:09:50.941 --> 00:09:55.941
<v Speaker 4>Well the problem with the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with the moral relativism nihilism </v>

146
00:09:55.941 --> 00:09:59.930
<v Speaker 4>position is that it leaves us with no </v>
<v Speaker 4>orientation and it also flies in the </v>

147
00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:03.810
<v Speaker 4>face of common sense observations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That there are ways to live that are bad</v>

148
00:10:03.811 --> 00:10:05.430
<v Speaker 4>and that there are ways to live that are</v>
<v Speaker 4>good,</v>

149
00:10:05.431 --> 00:10:10.431
<v Speaker 4>that people can generally agree on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that statements about those general </v>

150
00:10:10.431 --> 00:10:12.150
<v Speaker 4>agreements about how to live can be </v>
<v Speaker 4>considered factual.</v>

151
00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:17.840
<v Speaker 4>Now so and then the next part of Sam's </v>
<v Speaker 4>argument is that we require a value </v>

152
00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:20.550
<v Speaker 4>system that allows us to escape these </v>
<v Speaker 4>twin dangers.</v>

153
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:23.190
<v Speaker 4>One stultifies us and the other leaves </v>
<v Speaker 4>us hopeless,</v>

154
00:10:23.191 --> 00:10:26.430
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that value system has to be grounded</v>

155
00:10:26.431 --> 00:10:31.431
<v Speaker 4>in something real and the only thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>that he can see that actually </v>

156
00:10:31.431 --> 00:10:35.391
<v Speaker 4>constitutes real in any provable sense </v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's a certain amount of </v>

157
00:10:35.391 --> 00:10:36.660
<v Speaker 4>historical and conceptual weight behind </v>
<v Speaker 4>this claim,</v>

158
00:10:36.661 --> 00:10:41.190
<v Speaker 4>is the domain of empirical facts as as </v>
<v Speaker 4>they'd be manifested in the sciences and</v>

159
00:10:41.191 --> 00:10:46.191
<v Speaker 4>technologies that have made us </v>
<v Speaker 4>incredibly powerful and increasingly </v>

160
00:10:46.191 --> 00:10:49.551
<v Speaker 4>able to flourish in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so we need to ground our value </v>

161
00:10:49.551 --> 00:10:50.910
<v Speaker 4>propositions in something that we've </v>
<v Speaker 4>been able to determine,</v>

162
00:10:50.911 --> 00:10:55.911
<v Speaker 4>has genuine solidity to so that we can </v>
<v Speaker 4>so that we can orient ourselves properly</v>

163
00:10:56.101 --> 00:10:59.310
<v Speaker 4>so that we can make moral claims and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that we can avoid these two endangers.</v>

164
00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:03.300
<v Speaker 4>We can begin with some basic facts that </v>
<v Speaker 4>we can identify,</v>

165
00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.510
<v Speaker 4>as I mentioned very briefly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what constitutes a bad life.</v>

166
00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:08.160
<v Speaker 4>Endless pain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>suffering,</v>

167
00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:10.910
<v Speaker 4>anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tremendous amount of negative emotions,</v>

168
00:11:10.911 --> 00:11:15.911
<v Speaker 4>short term lifespan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All the things that no one would choose </v>

169
00:11:15.911 --> 00:11:15.911
<v Speaker 4>voluntarily for themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If,</v>

170
00:11:15.911 --> 00:11:20.290
<v Speaker 4>if we would all agree that they were </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking in a healthy manner and we can </v>

171
00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:24.801
<v Speaker 4>contrast that sort of domain of horror </v>
<v Speaker 4>with the good life which might involve </v>

172
00:11:24.801 --> 00:11:29.010
<v Speaker 4>while certainly freedom from privation </v>
<v Speaker 4>and want and undo threat and anxiety and</v>

173
00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:34.160
<v Speaker 4>hope for the future and all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that we can agree that those are </v>

174
00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:34.160
<v Speaker 4>polls,</v>
<v Speaker 4>good,</v>

175
00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.850
<v Speaker 4>bad and good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that that's a factual claim,</v>

176
00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:41.510
<v Speaker 4>so he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sam also claims that we can define the </v>

177
00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:44.541
<v Speaker 4>good life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is an extension of it with </v>

178
00:11:44.541 --> 00:11:46.670
<v Speaker 4>reference to flourishing and wellbeing </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that that that can actually be </v>

179
00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:49.881
<v Speaker 4>measured and that we should and can </v>
<v Speaker 4>inform the idea of flourishing and </v>

180
00:11:49.881 --> 00:11:50.730
<v Speaker 4>wellbeing with empirical data.</v>

181
00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:56.330
<v Speaker 4>Having said all that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he also a what would a domain of inquiry</v>

182
00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:03.090
<v Speaker 4>open that would be centered on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>possibility that some of the ideas that </v>

183
00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:05.050
<v Speaker 4>have been encapsulated in religious </v>
<v Speaker 4>phenomenology,</v>

184
00:12:05.051 --> 00:12:08.110
<v Speaker 4>if not in religious dogma,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it might be worth pursuing as well.</v>

185
00:12:08.111 --> 00:12:13.111
<v Speaker 4>That there might be wisdom that can </v>
<v Speaker 4>practically be applied in terms of </v>

186
00:12:13.111 --> 00:12:15.610
<v Speaker 4>perception too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to spiritual practices.</v>

187
00:12:15.611 --> 00:12:17.650
<v Speaker 4>Although those become dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dangerous,</v>

188
00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:20.350
<v Speaker 4>increasingly dangerous as they become </v>
<v Speaker 4>ensconced in dogma.</v>

189
00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:25.860
<v Speaker 4>And so that's Sam's position,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then his criticism of my ideas I'm </v>

190
00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:29.680
<v Speaker 4>take,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he would say that it's facts,</v>

191
00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:34.800
<v Speaker 4>not stories that constitute the ground </v>
<v Speaker 4>for the proper science of wellbeing and </v>

192
00:12:35.351 --> 00:12:37.600
<v Speaker 4>that we don't need to be connected to </v>
<v Speaker 4>stories,</v>

193
00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:42.660
<v Speaker 4>ancient stories in particular to thrive </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the reason for that or that these </v>

194
00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:45.550
<v Speaker 4>ancient stories are pathological in </v>
<v Speaker 4>certain details,</v>

195
00:12:45.551 --> 00:12:47.680
<v Speaker 4>especially in this specific claims they </v>
<v Speaker 4>make up,</v>

196
00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:52.710
<v Speaker 4>which,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which looks outrageous in some sense </v>

197
00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:52.710
<v Speaker 4>from a modern moral perspective.</v>

198
00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:56.230
<v Speaker 4>And he believes that it's hand waving to</v>
<v Speaker 4>ignore those specific topics.</v>

199
00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:57.520
<v Speaker 4>And with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

200
00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:58.960
<v Speaker 4>with uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what would you call it,</v>

201
00:12:58.961 --> 00:13:03.961
<v Speaker 4>an optimistic overview of the entire </v>
<v Speaker 4>context that they're dangerously </v>

202
00:13:05.081 --> 00:13:07.720
<v Speaker 4>outdated now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they ever were useful,</v>

203
00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:13.830
<v Speaker 4>that they're subject to too many </v>
<v Speaker 4>potential interpretations for any modern</v>

204
00:13:14.371 --> 00:13:19.371
<v Speaker 4>usage to be reliably derived.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so he believes that attempts to </v>

205
00:13:19.371 --> 00:13:20.950
<v Speaker 4>interpret these stories,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>

206
00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:26.790
<v Speaker 4>are rife with so many potential errors </v>
<v Speaker 4>of bias and interpretation and </v>

207
00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:31.621
<v Speaker 4>subjectivity that all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>interpretations in some sense are </v>

208
00:13:31.621 --> 00:13:34.951
<v Speaker 4>unreliable and perhaps equally </v>
<v Speaker 4>unreliable that their day is that worse </v>

209
00:13:34.951 --> 00:13:36.520
<v Speaker 4>than that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not only are they unreliable,</v>

210
00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:41.650
<v Speaker 4>but they're dangerous in so far as the </v>
<v Speaker 4>claims they lay out our pose,</v>

211
00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:44.290
<v Speaker 4>a threat to scientific and enlightenment</v>
<v Speaker 4>values,</v>

212
00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:48.040
<v Speaker 4>which are the true saviors of humanity </v>
<v Speaker 4>as evidenced by our progress,</v>

213
00:13:48.041 --> 00:13:50.080
<v Speaker 4>let's say over the last two or 300 </v>
<v Speaker 4>years,</v>

214
00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:54.400
<v Speaker 4>and that they're also susceptible to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>totalitarian interpretation,</v>

215
00:13:54.401 --> 00:13:59.401
<v Speaker 4>which I described earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which confer upon the interpreter a </v>

216
00:13:59.401 --> 00:14:00.820
<v Speaker 4>sense of and then a claim to reveal </v>
<v Speaker 4>truth.</v>

217
00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:06.300
<v Speaker 4>And so I would say that Sam's argument </v>
<v Speaker 4>and his and his criticisms of my </v>

218
00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:06.880
<v Speaker 4>position,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so.</v>

219
00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:09.150
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you write my next book.</v>

220
00:14:09.151 --> 00:14:14.151
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thanks Sam.</v>

221
00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:19.920
<v Speaker 1>Feel about that characterization of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>position.</v>

222
00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:25.230
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>certainly close enough to get the </v>

223
00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:25.230
<v Speaker 3>conversation started.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I met.</v>

224
00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:28.200
<v Speaker 3>There's a few the grounding stuff we </v>
<v Speaker 3>have yet to talk about and I'm not as,</v>

225
00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:33.500
<v Speaker 3>I'm not as much a stickler for </v>
<v Speaker 3>materialistic scientific empiricism as I</v>

226
00:14:35.041 --> 00:14:36.690
<v Speaker 3>heard implied there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we can,</v>

227
00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:36.690
<v Speaker 3>can,</v>

228
00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:37.640
<v Speaker 1>we can come to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

229
00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:42.680
<v Speaker 1>So hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think from the point of view of the </v>

230
00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:42.680
<v Speaker 1>audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a,</v>

231
00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:47.271
<v Speaker 1>this is a good barometer of where we got</v>
<v Speaker 1>to last night and I think actually the </v>

232
00:14:47.271 --> 00:14:51.561
<v Speaker 1>gains are really impressive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I have to say is me because </v>

233
00:14:52.011 --> 00:14:53.870
<v Speaker 1>there's something called regression to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mean.</v>

234
00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:57.590
<v Speaker 1>Now if I catch either one of you </v>
<v Speaker 1>regressing to the mean tonight,</v>

235
00:14:57.591 --> 00:15:02.591
<v Speaker 1>I will hunt you down and I will ridicule</v>
<v Speaker 1>you on twitter tomorrow so you have a </v>

236
00:15:02.591 --> 00:15:03.300
<v Speaker 1>warrant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

237
00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:09.220
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do either one of you wants to now </v>

238
00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:13.300
<v Speaker 1>talk about what was missing from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other characterization or how do you </v>

239
00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:14.680
<v Speaker 1>want to move?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we should</v>

240
00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:19.150
<v Speaker 3>touch this issue of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of metaphorical truth because I think it</v>

241
00:15:19.151 --> 00:15:22.780
<v Speaker 3>still gets at the distance between us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

242
00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:28.550
<v Speaker 3>As a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's happily this is you're afraid </v>

243
00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:28.550
<v Speaker 3>that you have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might want to do</v>

244
00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:30.480
<v Speaker 1>prop up this phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why not?</v>

245
00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:36.260
<v Speaker 1>So the idea of metaphorical truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think actually is the </v>

246
00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:40.191
<v Speaker 1>reconciliation between at least the </v>
<v Speaker 1>points that you guys each started out </v>

247
00:15:40.191 --> 00:15:44.691
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the idea that there are concepts </v>

248
00:15:44.691 --> 00:15:47.721
<v Speaker 1>which are literally false,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we can falsify in a scientific </v>

249
00:15:47.721 --> 00:15:52.430
<v Speaker 1>rational sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that if you behave as if they were </v>

250
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:56.241
<v Speaker 1>true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you come out ahead of where you were if </v>

251
00:15:56.241 --> 00:15:56.880
<v Speaker 1>you behave according to the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they are false.</v>

252
00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:01.230
<v Speaker 1>And so to call these things simply false</v>
<v Speaker 1>is an error in effect.</v>

253
00:16:01.231 --> 00:16:06.231
<v Speaker 1>The universe has left them true in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense other than a purely literal one.</v>

254
00:16:06.811 --> 00:16:11.811
<v Speaker 1>And so religions with them according to </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually what you heard from both Sam </v>

255
00:16:11.811 --> 00:16:16.051
<v Speaker 1>and Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>religions would fall into this class of </v>

256
00:16:16.051 --> 00:16:17.730
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are encapsulations of,</v>

257
00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:23.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stories and prescriptions that if you </v>

258
00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:26.991
<v Speaker 1>follow them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>irrespective of whether they literally </v>

259
00:16:26.991 --> 00:16:29.900
<v Speaker 1>describe the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you end up with certain advantages that </v>

260
00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:31.260
<v Speaker 1>you may not know why they are there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But nonetheless,</v>

261
00:16:31.261 --> 00:16:32.930
<v Speaker 1>you are ahead of your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

262
00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:38.040
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your head of your position if you were </v>

263
00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:38.100
<v Speaker 1>to navigate just simply on your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your perceptions.</v>

264
00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:39.600
<v Speaker 1>That's the concept.</v>

265
00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:44.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think there's a good analogy that </v>

266
00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:45.100
<v Speaker 3>you and I stumbled onto after we did a </v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast together.</v>

267
00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:50.130
<v Speaker 3>You had a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an analogy about a porcupine that could </v>

268
00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:50.740
<v Speaker 3>shoot its quills,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which many people balked at,</v>

269
00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:55.760
<v Speaker 3>but listener and gave us a better one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was the idea that anyone who's </v>

270
00:16:56.801 --> 00:17:01.801
<v Speaker 3>worked with guns at all must've heard </v>
<v Speaker 3>this admonishment to treat every gun as </v>

271
00:17:03.791 --> 00:17:05.200
<v Speaker 3>if it is loaded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

272
00:17:05.201 --> 00:17:10.201
<v Speaker 3>And you actually last night when I </v>
<v Speaker 3>alleged that you believed in God,</v>

273
00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:12.100
<v Speaker 3>you corrected me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

274
00:17:12.101 --> 00:17:14.530
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you live as if God exists.</v>

275
00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:15.880
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so this seems like a,</v>

276
00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:19.950
<v Speaker 3>there's a connection here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if,</v>

277
00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:25.210
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I had a gun here that I wanted to </v>

278
00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:25.210
<v Speaker 3>show Brett,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I know anything about guns,</v>

279
00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:28.180
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to make damn sure that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>unloaded,</v>

280
00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:29.550
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to pull back the slide.</v>

281
00:17:29.551 --> 00:17:30.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drop the magazine,</v>

282
00:17:30.491 --> 00:17:35.491
<v Speaker 3>pulled back the slide,</v>
<v Speaker 3>check the chamber and do this in a </v>

283
00:17:35.491 --> 00:17:38.881
<v Speaker 3>redundant fashion that that really looks</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I'm suffering from obsessive </v>

284
00:17:38.881 --> 00:17:39.030
<v Speaker 3>compulsive disorder.</v>

285
00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:44.040
<v Speaker 3>Maybe if it is truly redundant and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll hand it to Brad and Brett knows </v>

286
00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:46.480
<v Speaker 3>anything about guns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He will do the same thing,</v>

287
00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:51.120
<v Speaker 3>having just seen me do it and if he </v>
<v Speaker 3>hands it back to me again,</v>

288
00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:52.820
<v Speaker 3>I will do the same thing even though </v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

289
00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:55.140
<v Speaker 3>there may be no ammunition around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

290
00:17:55.141 --> 00:18:00.141
<v Speaker 3>So it really is crazy at the level of </v>
<v Speaker 3>our explicit knowledge of the situation </v>

291
00:18:00.361 --> 00:18:03.940
<v Speaker 3>and yet absolutely necessary to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>

292
00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:06.630
<v Speaker 3>it's not merely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

293
00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:08.790
<v Speaker 3>it runs very deep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

294
00:18:08.791 --> 00:18:12.990
<v Speaker 3>I would even add to that whole time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were careful not to point the barrel</v>

295
00:18:12.991 --> 00:18:15.780
<v Speaker 3>of the gun at anything you would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>afraid to shoot.</v>

296
00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:19.590
<v Speaker 3>And when people fail to live this way </v>
<v Speaker 3>around guns,</v>

297
00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:24.620
<v Speaker 3>they with some frequency actually shoot </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves or people close to them by </v>

298
00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:25.350
<v Speaker 3>accident.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

299
00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:29.820
<v Speaker 3>so it is really the only proper hedge </v>
<v Speaker 3>against just the,</v>

300
00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:32.530
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the odds of being in proximity to,</v>

301
00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:34.740
<v Speaker 3>to loaded weapons.</v>

302
00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:40.550
<v Speaker 3>And yet if someone in the middle of this</v>
<v Speaker 3>operation came up to us and said,</v>

303
00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:46.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually there's a casino that just </v>

304
00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:47.931
<v Speaker 3>opened across the street that will take </v>
<v Speaker 3>your bets about whether or not guns are </v>

305
00:18:47.931 --> 00:18:52.491
<v Speaker 3>loaded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would you like to bet a million dollars </v>

306
00:18:52.491 --> 00:18:52.491
<v Speaker 3>as to whether or not this gun is loaded?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

307
00:18:52.491 --> 00:18:57.110
<v Speaker 3>of course I would bet those million </v>
<v Speaker 3>dollars every time that it's not loaded </v>

308
00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:57.840
<v Speaker 3>because I know it's not loaded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's.</v>

309
00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:03.080
<v Speaker 3>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a literal truth and a </v>

310
00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:06.080
<v Speaker 3>metaphorical truth where you know </v>
<v Speaker 3>otherwise known as a very useful </v>

311
00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:10.161
<v Speaker 3>fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which in this case is actually more </v>

312
00:19:10.161 --> 00:19:10.470
<v Speaker 3>useful than the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

313
00:19:10.471 --> 00:19:14.700
<v Speaker 3>But the only way I can understand its </v>
<v Speaker 3>utility is,</v>

314
00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:20.290
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and even utter the phrase metaphorical </v>

315
00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:23.190
<v Speaker 3>truth in a way that is comprehensible is</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the context of distinguishing it from</v>

316
00:19:23.191 --> 00:19:24.450
<v Speaker 3>literal truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

317
00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:27.330
<v Speaker 5>Go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is fascinating Sam.</v>

318
00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:29.920
<v Speaker 5>Actually this is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is I think next year.</v>

319
00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:32.350
<v Speaker 3>I'm a little worried by how excited you </v>
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>

320
00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:38.370
<v Speaker 5>So I have a story that might be helpful </v>
<v Speaker 5>about that.</v>

321
00:19:38.371 --> 00:19:40.980
<v Speaker 5>And so you could,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could tell me what you think about.</v>

322
00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:41.910
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Think about this.</v>

323
00:19:41.911 --> 00:19:42.420
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

324
00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:48.230
<v Speaker 5>so one of the things that I've been </v>
<v Speaker 5>reconsidering since we talked last night</v>

325
00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:53.810
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is the nature of our dispute about the </v>

326
00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:56.571
<v Speaker 5>relationship between facts and values.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because I think I can make a case that </v>

327
00:19:56.571 --> 00:19:59.850
<v Speaker 5>what I've been trying to do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially in my first book,</v>

328
00:19:59.851 --> 00:20:04.851
<v Speaker 5>was to ground values in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm not doing it the same way that </v>

329
00:20:04.851 --> 00:20:04.851
<v Speaker 5>you are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

330
00:20:04.851 --> 00:20:05.610
<v Speaker 5>So.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I,</v>

331
00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:08.520
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to make that a point of </v>
<v Speaker 5>contention so.</v>

332
00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:13.730
<v Speaker 5>And I'll get to that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But with regards to this metaphorical </v>

333
00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:13.730
<v Speaker 5>truth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let me tell you something.</v>

334
00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:16.410
<v Speaker 5>You tell me what you think about this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So one of them,</v>

335
00:20:16.411 --> 00:20:21.411
<v Speaker 5>things that's been observed by </v>
<v Speaker 5>anthropologists worldwide is that human </v>

336
00:20:21.411 --> 00:20:24.240
<v Speaker 5>beings tend to make sacrifices.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I'm going to spend two minutes,</v>

337
00:20:24.241 --> 00:20:27.330
<v Speaker 5>three minutes laying out a sacrificial </v>
<v Speaker 5>story.</v>

338
00:20:27.331 --> 00:20:32.331
<v Speaker 5>And the reason I want to do it is </v>
<v Speaker 5>because see what I think happened with </v>

339
00:20:32.331 --> 00:20:36.531
<v Speaker 5>regards to the origin of these profound </v>
<v Speaker 5>stories is that people first started to </v>

340
00:20:36.631 --> 00:20:40.650
<v Speaker 5>behave in certain ways that had a </v>
<v Speaker 5>survival significance.</v>

341
00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:45.400
<v Speaker 5>And that was selected for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And as a consequence of,</v>

342
00:20:45.401 --> 00:20:46.050
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>

343
00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:47.980
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of this standard</v>

344
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:51.520
<v Speaker 4>selection practices.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that was instantiated,</v>

345
00:20:51.521 --> 00:20:56.521
<v Speaker 4>didn't behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then because we can observe </v>

346
00:20:56.521 --> 00:20:56.521
<v Speaker 4>ourselves because we're self conscious </v>
<v Speaker 4>creatures,</v>

347
00:20:56.521 --> 00:21:00.920
<v Speaker 4>that we started to make representations </v>
<v Speaker 4>of those patterns and dramatize them.</v>

348
00:21:00.921 --> 00:21:04.260
<v Speaker 4>And then encapsulate them in stories,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's a bottom up from the.</v>

349
00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:09.390
<v Speaker 4>So it would be sort of like chimpanzees </v>
<v Speaker 4>or wolves become aware of their </v>

350
00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:12.100
<v Speaker 4>dominance hierarchy structures and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>strategies that they use.</v>

351
00:21:12.101 --> 00:21:13.390
<v Speaker 4>So a wolf,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

352
00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:15.520
<v Speaker 4>if two wolves are having a dominance </v>
<v Speaker 4>dispute,</v>

353
00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:20.620
<v Speaker 4>one the wolf that gives up first lays </v>
<v Speaker 4>down and puts his neck open so the other</v>

354
00:21:20.621 --> 00:21:22.930
<v Speaker 4>wolf can tear it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the other wolf doesn't.</v>

355
00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:24.070
<v Speaker 4>And you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

356
00:21:24.071 --> 00:21:28.480
<v Speaker 4>it's as if a wolf is following a rule </v>
<v Speaker 4>about not killing a weaker member of the</v>

357
00:21:28.481 --> 00:21:30.850
<v Speaker 4>pack.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course wolves don't have rules,</v>

358
00:21:30.851 --> 00:21:35.851
<v Speaker 4>they have behavioral patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but a self conscious wolf would watch </v>

359
00:21:35.851 --> 00:21:37.540
<v Speaker 4>what the wolves were doing and then say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

360
00:21:37.541 --> 00:21:41.650
<v Speaker 4>it's as if we're acting out the idea </v>
<v Speaker 4>that each wolf in the pack has intrinsic</v>

361
00:21:41.651 --> 00:21:42.100
<v Speaker 4>value.</v>

362
00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:47.550
<v Speaker 4>And then that starts to be maybe that </v>
<v Speaker 4>wolves would have a little story about </v>

363
00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:50.550
<v Speaker 4>the heroic for bearing wolf that doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>tear out the neck of its opponents and </v>

364
00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:51.350
<v Speaker 4>that that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

365
00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:53.170
<v Speaker 4>that's good wolf ethics and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

366
00:21:53.171 --> 00:21:54.850
<v Speaker 4>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's grounded,</v>

367
00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:56.710
<v Speaker 4>but it's grounded in the actual </v>
<v Speaker 4>behavior.</v>

368
00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:58.150
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So let's,</v>

369
00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:00.150
<v Speaker 4>we'll put that aside for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now here,</v>

370
00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:04.090
<v Speaker 4>here's the sacrificial story to human </v>
<v Speaker 4>beings have made sacrifices.</v>

371
00:22:04.091 --> 00:22:09.091
<v Speaker 4>It seems to be a standard practice all </v>
<v Speaker 4>around the world and in the biblical </v>

372
00:22:09.091 --> 00:22:12.541
<v Speaker 4>narratives,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would often sacrifice something of </v>

373
00:22:12.541 --> 00:22:14.881
<v Speaker 4>value like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a valuable animal or like a child </v>

374
00:22:14.881 --> 00:22:14.881
<v Speaker 4>start.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

375
00:22:14.881 --> 00:22:15.110
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

376
00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:15.610
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

377
00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:16.360
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not.</v>

378
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:21.390
<v Speaker 4>I'm not making light of this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know that human sacrifice was a part </v>

379
00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:21.390
<v Speaker 4>of this.</v>

380
00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:21.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that again,</v>

381
00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:25.000
<v Speaker 3>so just to give you a crib on where my </v>
<v Speaker 3>mind goes,</v>

382
00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:30.010
<v Speaker 3>there is human.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Human sacrifice is as old a religious </v>

383
00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:32.740
<v Speaker 3>precept as we know about as a cultural </v>
<v Speaker 3>universal.</v>

384
00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:38.170
<v Speaker 3>The other sacrifices are derivations </v>
<v Speaker 3>from Ed and circumcision is a surrogate </v>

385
00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:43.350
<v Speaker 3>for the far more barbaric act of human </v>
<v Speaker 3>sacrifice and you know it,</v>

386
00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:48.490
<v Speaker 3>it answers every test you would put to </v>
<v Speaker 3>it with respect to its archetypal </v>

387
00:22:48.701 --> 00:22:53.701
<v Speaker 3>significance and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's compelling a presence in stories </v>

388
00:22:54.011 --> 00:22:59.011
<v Speaker 3>across all cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the horror is that it actually has </v>

389
00:22:59.011 --> 00:23:03.841
<v Speaker 3>taken place in all these cultures based </v>
<v Speaker 3>on explicit beliefs in the presence of </v>

390
00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:08.110
<v Speaker 3>just just right Arthur scientific </v>
<v Speaker 3>ignorance.</v>

391
00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:12.040
<v Speaker 4>Flirt used that as the argument for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>essential insanity of humanity.</v>

392
00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:14.470
<v Speaker 3>We have nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not just the insanity of humanity,</v>

393
00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:18.130
<v Speaker 3>it's the misapprehension of the causal </v>
<v Speaker 3>structure of the cosmos.</v>

394
00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:21.730
<v Speaker 3>You don't know what the weather.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't know why people get sick.</v>

395
00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:24.790
<v Speaker 3>You think your neighbor is capable of </v>
<v Speaker 3>cast a magic spell.</v>

396
00:23:24.791 --> 00:23:27.310
<v Speaker 3>It's on you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're ignorant of everything and you're</v>

397
00:23:27.311 --> 00:23:32.311
<v Speaker 3>trying to force some order on things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so when you don't in the absence of </v>

398
00:23:32.311 --> 00:23:35.920
<v Speaker 3>engineers and you don't know why bill </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain buildings fall down,</v>

399
00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:41.190
<v Speaker 3>you actually can agree with your </v>
<v Speaker 3>neighbor that maybe you should barrier </v>

400
00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:44.500
<v Speaker 3>first born child into every post hole of</v>
<v Speaker 3>this new building,</v>

401
00:23:44.501 --> 00:23:49.501
<v Speaker 3>which in fact has took place and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>the consequence of ignorance and so that</v>

402
00:23:50.531 --> 00:23:55.530
<v Speaker 3>the problem is if you're only going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk about this notion of sacrifice,</v>

403
00:23:55.550 --> 00:23:58.530
<v Speaker 3>very strange consequence of ignorance </v>
<v Speaker 3>like you.</v>

404
00:23:59.010 --> 00:24:04.010
<v Speaker 3>It's the notion that we're in </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship to invisible others that </v>

405
00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:05.330
<v Speaker 3>can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that can mistreat us based on not having</v>

406
00:24:05.331 --> 00:24:09.420
<v Speaker 3>offered enough were we are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not precisely those others well,</v>

407
00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:14.440
<v Speaker 3>but we're in relationship to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>invisible others who will judge us in </v>

408
00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:14.800
<v Speaker 3>the future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So again,</v>

409
00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:20.090
<v Speaker 3>you're changing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're changing the noun in important </v>

410
00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:20.090
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm also trying to understand,</v>

411
00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:22.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm not trying to argue against the </v>
<v Speaker 3>horror of child sacrifice.</v>

412
00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:24.700
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would never imagine,</v>

413
00:24:25.910 --> 00:24:28.760
<v Speaker 3>but I'm also.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'm also find out what my work would</v>

414
00:24:28.761 --> 00:24:29.990
<v Speaker 3>be much easier if you did that.</v>

415
00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:32.310
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yes,</v>

416
00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:33.190
<v Speaker 5>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

417
00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:35.820
<v Speaker 5>and the work of journalists as well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they've tried that.</v>

418
00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:37.020
<v Speaker 5>Pretty much anyone,</v>

419
00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:43.070
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That would be,</v>

420
00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:45.410
<v Speaker 5>that would even be worse than enforced </v>
<v Speaker 5>monogamy.</v>

421
00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:47.090
<v Speaker 5>Hypothetical.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

422
00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:49.150
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So see,</v>

423
00:24:49.151 --> 00:24:54.151
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say that I'm trying to give the </v>

424
00:24:54.151 --> 00:24:56.231
<v Speaker 5>devil his due and I'm trying to </v>
<v Speaker 5>understand from an evolutionary </v>

425
00:24:56.231 --> 00:24:59.501
<v Speaker 5>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like cognitive behavioral evolutionary </v>

426
00:24:59.501 --> 00:25:02.291
<v Speaker 5>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say why that particular set of </v>

427
00:25:02.291 --> 00:25:02.291
<v Speaker 5>ideas would emerge and in many,</v>
<v Speaker 5>many,</v>

428
00:25:02.291 --> 00:25:07.031
<v Speaker 5>many places perhaps autonomously or once</v>
<v Speaker 5>having emerged would spread like </v>

429
00:25:07.031 --> 00:25:07.031
<v Speaker 5>wildfire.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

430
00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:10.040
<v Speaker 5>because I'm not willing to only </v>
<v Speaker 5>attribute it to ignorance,</v>

431
00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:13.060
<v Speaker 5>now we can attribute it to ignorance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No problem man,</v>

432
00:25:13.061 --> 00:25:18.061
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's more going on there because </v>

433
00:25:18.061 --> 00:25:20.021
<v Speaker 5>it is a human universal and like there's</v>
<v Speaker 5>all sorts of things that happened in </v>

434
00:25:20.021 --> 00:25:23.321
<v Speaker 5>nature as a consequence of biological </v>
<v Speaker 5>and evolutionary processes that don't </v>

435
00:25:23.321 --> 00:25:26.300
<v Speaker 5>work out well for our current state of </v>
<v Speaker 5>moral intuition,</v>

436
00:25:26.301 --> 00:25:27.290
<v Speaker 5>like saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

437
00:25:27.291 --> 00:25:32.291
<v Speaker 5>so one of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because I've been thinking about this </v>

438
00:25:32.291 --> 00:25:33.530
<v Speaker 5>sacrificial motif for a very long time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to figure out what that,</v>

439
00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:35.240
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the hell's the idea here?</v>

440
00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:36.470
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>

441
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:38.780
<v Speaker 5>so here's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's one way of thinking about it.</v>

442
00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:43.910
<v Speaker 5>If you give up something of value,</v>
<v Speaker 5>now you can gain something of more value</v>

443
00:25:43.911 --> 00:25:46.490
<v Speaker 5>in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay?</v>

444
00:25:46.491 --> 00:25:48.500
<v Speaker 5>So let's think about that idea for a </v>
<v Speaker 5>minute.</v>

445
00:25:48.501 --> 00:25:52.190
<v Speaker 5>So the first thing is that's an,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a hell of an idea.</v>

446
00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:53.630
<v Speaker 5>That's delayed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>delayed,</v>

447
00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:55.250
<v Speaker 5>delayed gratification,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

448
00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:58.550
<v Speaker 5>That's the discovery of the future as </v>
<v Speaker 5>well.</v>

449
00:25:58.730 --> 00:25:59.990
<v Speaker 5>And so you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

450
00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:05.020
<v Speaker 5>the notion of sacrifice is exactly the </v>
<v Speaker 5>same thing as the discovery of the </v>

451
00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:07.250
<v Speaker 5>future.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If we give up something we really value,</v>

452
00:26:07.251 --> 00:26:12.251
<v Speaker 5>now we can make a pact with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>structure of existence itself such that </v>

453
00:26:12.251 --> 00:26:14.150
<v Speaker 5>better things will happen to us in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>future.</v>

454
00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:15.150
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

455
00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:20.170
<v Speaker 5>now what's weird about this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's hard to understand is that it </v>

456
00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:22.130
<v Speaker 5>works.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So when I talked to my students,</v>

457
00:26:22.131 --> 00:26:23.330
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I say,</v>

458
00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:27.740
<v Speaker 5>what did your parents sacrifice to send </v>
<v Speaker 5>you to university?</v>

459
00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:31.010
<v Speaker 5>Many of them are children are first </v>
<v Speaker 5>generation immigrants and so like,</v>

460
00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:33.080
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're on that story in a second,</v>

461
00:26:33.081 --> 00:26:34.940
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They know all sorts of things that their</v>

462
00:26:34.941 --> 00:26:39.941
<v Speaker 5>parents sacrificed and they're delaying </v>
<v Speaker 5>gratification in the present for a </v>

463
00:26:39.941 --> 00:26:43.530
<v Speaker 5>radically delayed return in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now you think animals,</v>

464
00:26:43.531 --> 00:26:48.531
<v Speaker 5>generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they might act out the idea of delayed </v>

465
00:26:48.531 --> 00:26:49.560
<v Speaker 5>gratification as a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 5>running out their instincts,</v>

466
00:26:49.561 --> 00:26:54.561
<v Speaker 5>but they don't conceptualize it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not obvious that animals give up </v>

467
00:26:54.561 --> 00:26:56.400
<v Speaker 5>something they valued right now in order</v>
<v Speaker 5>to thrive in the future.</v>

468
00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:58.770
<v Speaker 5>There's an old story about how to catch </v>
<v Speaker 5>a monkey,</v>

469
00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:01.710
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you put a jar up with rocks in it.</v>

470
00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:04.110
<v Speaker 5>Then you put little candies and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 5>narrow neck jar.</v>

471
00:27:04.111 --> 00:27:05.820
<v Speaker 5>You put little candies on top of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>rocks,</v>

472
00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:08.970
<v Speaker 5>but if you candies in front of the of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the jar,</v>

473
00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:11.100
<v Speaker 5>then the monkey comes along and picks up</v>
<v Speaker 5>the candies,</v>

474
00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:13.230
<v Speaker 5>puts his hand in the jar,</v>
<v Speaker 5>grabs the candies,</v>

475
00:27:13.231 --> 00:27:14.190
<v Speaker 5>and can't get it out.</v>

476
00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:19.550
<v Speaker 5>I still don't know if this actually </v>
<v Speaker 5>works on monkeys or it's just a great </v>

477
00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:19.550
<v Speaker 5>story.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

478
00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:20.700
<v Speaker 5>I don't know either and that I've heard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've heard,</v>

479
00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:22.370
<v Speaker 5>I've heard various claims,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but.</v>

480
00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:24.810
<v Speaker 5>But the point is you can go pick up the </v>
<v Speaker 5>monkey.</v>

481
00:27:24.811 --> 00:27:26.970
<v Speaker 5>He won't let go of the candidates.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now perhaps he would,</v>

482
00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:28.210
<v Speaker 5>but the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>

483
00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:33.470
<v Speaker 5>the issue is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that it's not obvious that animals </v>

484
00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:35.010
<v Speaker 5>will forgo and immediate gratification </v>
<v Speaker 5>for a future gratification.</v>

485
00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:37.230
<v Speaker 5>Now that don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that's right actually,</v>

486
00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:39.180
<v Speaker 5>and I actually want to hold the question</v>
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>

487
00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:42.150
<v Speaker 5>will they do it consciously?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They might act it out.</v>

488
00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:44.520
<v Speaker 5>They act it out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not the issue.</v>

489
00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:49.580
<v Speaker 5>It's very hard to know if it's conscious</v>
<v Speaker 5>because they won't respond to the </v>

490
00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:49.580
<v Speaker 5>questionnaires,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I know,</v>

491
00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:53.100
<v Speaker 5>I know obviously the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the line between acting it out and </v>

492
00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:55.210
<v Speaker 5>becoming,</v>
<v Speaker 5>starting to consciously represented is a</v>

493
00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:55.890
<v Speaker 5>tenuous one.</v>

494
00:27:55.890 --> 00:28:00.890
<v Speaker 5>But what looks to me like what happened </v>
<v Speaker 5>is that after we observed that people </v>

495
00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:04.440
<v Speaker 5>who were capable of delaying </v>
<v Speaker 5>gratification,</v>

496
00:28:04.441 --> 00:28:08.580
<v Speaker 5>sacrifice things that they valued in </v>
<v Speaker 5>order to obtain a future goal,</v>

497
00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:13.610
<v Speaker 5>and it work,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that we started to codify that as a </v>

498
00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:14.370
<v Speaker 5>representation and then started to act </v>
<v Speaker 5>it out.</v>

499
00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:16.670
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so the story and,</v>

500
00:28:16.671 --> 00:28:19.290
<v Speaker 5>and you'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well that produced strange variance,</v>

501
00:28:19.291 --> 00:28:21.060
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's a reason for that too,</v>

502
00:28:21.061 --> 00:28:23.490
<v Speaker 5>as far as I can say.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So imagine this,</v>

503
00:28:23.491 --> 00:28:28.491
<v Speaker 5>imagine that there's a rule of thumb </v>
<v Speaker 5>sacrificing what you find valuable now </v>

504
00:28:29.461 --> 00:28:32.310
<v Speaker 5>will ensure certain benefits in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>future.</v>

505
00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:37.830
<v Speaker 5>Well then the question becomes how good </v>
<v Speaker 5>could those future benefits be?</v>

506
00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:42.880
<v Speaker 5>And so that might be heavenly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say in the archetypal extreme and </v>

507
00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:45.000
<v Speaker 5>what's the ultimate sacrifice that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>have to perform?</v>

508
00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:46.230
<v Speaker 5>And then I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

509
00:28:46.231 --> 00:28:48.630
<v Speaker 5>the child sacrifice fits into that </v>
<v Speaker 5>category.</v>

510
00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:53.870
<v Speaker 5>And so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's as if those ideas were pushed to </v>

511
00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:53.870
<v Speaker 5>the radical extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you could say,</v>

512
00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:55.560
<v Speaker 5>well that's a pathological extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

513
00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:59.010
<v Speaker 5>well it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is a pathological extreme.</v>

514
00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:04.520
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think we also have to understand </v>

515
00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:07.790
<v Speaker 5>that some of the things that we've </v>
<v Speaker 5>learned as we've evolved towards our </v>

516
00:29:07.790 --> 00:29:11.271
<v Speaker 5>current state of wisdom such as it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that they were learned in a very </v>

517
00:29:11.271 --> 00:29:15.831
<v Speaker 5>bloody and catastrophic way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were learning with incredible </v>

518
00:29:15.831 --> 00:29:19.311
<v Speaker 5>difficulty and delay of gratification </v>
<v Speaker 5>was certainly one of those because it's </v>

519
00:29:19.311 --> 00:29:20.790
<v Speaker 5>a hell of a thing to learn when you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>in conditions of privation.</v>

520
00:29:20.791 --> 00:29:21.090
<v Speaker 5>Okay?</v>

521
00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:26.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that the issue here for me is </v>

522
00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:29.301
<v Speaker 3>that you don't need a conception of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't need any kind of positive </v>

523
00:29:30.691 --> 00:29:35.691
<v Speaker 3>gloss on human sacrifice as a meme or as</v>
<v Speaker 3>an archetype in order to form a coherent</v>

524
00:29:38.221 --> 00:29:40.260
<v Speaker 3>picture of the future that can motivate </v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

525
00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:43.560
<v Speaker 3>So delayed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>delayed gratification is fully separable</v>

526
00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:48.930
<v Speaker 3>from a notion that it might ever be </v>
<v Speaker 3>rational or good to sacrifice a child as</v>

527
00:29:53.081 --> 00:29:55.600
<v Speaker 3>an offering to an invisible other</v>

528
00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:57.460
<v Speaker 5>that doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How do you know it's separate will?</v>

529
00:29:57.461 --> 00:29:59.230
<v Speaker 5>Because that's the developmental </v>
<v Speaker 5>history,</v>

530
00:29:59.231 --> 00:29:59.980
<v Speaker 5>as you said.</v>

531
00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:01.230
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that so sacrifice,</v>

532
00:30:01.231 --> 00:30:04.870
<v Speaker 3>and I think it is in fact historically </v>
<v Speaker 3>separable,</v>

533
00:30:04.871 --> 00:30:06.340
<v Speaker 3>but let.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's just say it's not.</v>

534
00:30:06.341 --> 00:30:08.620
<v Speaker 3>Let's just say as a matter of our </v>
<v Speaker 3>origins,</v>

535
00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:11.170
<v Speaker 3>they're united,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're of a piece,</v>

536
00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:17.070
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is the genetic fallacy to care about </v>

537
00:30:17.231 --> 00:30:22.231
<v Speaker 3>that origin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean to say that the that is the only </v>

538
00:30:22.871 --> 00:30:25.690
<v Speaker 3>path forward toward an ocean of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>future,</v>

539
00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:30.810
<v Speaker 3>given where we've come from or that it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>somehow necessary to to venerate now or </v>

540
00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:30.910
<v Speaker 3>that it's.</v>

541
00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:34.620
<v Speaker 5>But we do venerate the idea of sacrifice</v>
<v Speaker 5>now,</v>

542
00:30:34.621 --> 00:30:35.370
<v Speaker 5>but I would say</v>

543
00:30:36.370 --> 00:30:40.600
<v Speaker 3>we do a to to the detriment of our moral</v>
<v Speaker 3>intuitions in the religious context.</v>

544
00:30:40.601 --> 00:30:45.601
<v Speaker 3>So for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that the notion that </v>

545
00:30:45.601 --> 00:30:47.260
<v Speaker 3>Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Christianity is actually a cult of human</v>

546
00:30:47.261 --> 00:30:52.261
<v Speaker 3>sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It Christianity is not a religion that </v>

547
00:30:52.261 --> 00:30:52.810
<v Speaker 3>repudiates human sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Christianity is a religion that says,</v>

548
00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:58.320
<v Speaker 3>actually no human sacrifice is necessary</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there was only one that in fact was </v>

549
00:30:58.691 --> 00:31:01.240
<v Speaker 3>necessary and effective and that's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sacrifice of Jesus.</v>

550
00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:06.810
<v Speaker 3>And I think that is when you dig into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the details,</v>

551
00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:12.440
<v Speaker 3>a not only a morally uninteresting </v>
<v Speaker 3>vision of our circumstance and how we </v>

552
00:31:13.451 --> 00:31:15.190
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how we can be redeemed,</v>

553
00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:17.170
<v Speaker 3>it's morally a parent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

554
00:31:17.171 --> 00:31:18.690
<v Speaker 3>So I think there's a better version.</v>

555
00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:21.430
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let me ask you a question about that.</v>

556
00:31:21.431 --> 00:31:23.760
<v Speaker 5>So in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>

557
00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:25.570
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the moral landscape,</v>

558
00:31:25.630 --> 00:31:30.630
<v Speaker 5>you lay out this pathway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's the bad life and there's the </v>

559
00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:30.700
<v Speaker 5>good life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

560
00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:35.940
<v Speaker 5>And you described what they were at.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The bad life is a variation of hellish </v>

561
00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:39.631
<v Speaker 5>circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In the good life is a variant of </v>

562
00:31:39.631 --> 00:31:39.631
<v Speaker 5>hypothetically the life that we would </v>
<v Speaker 5>like to lead.</v>

563
00:31:39.631 --> 00:31:42.010
<v Speaker 5>And your conception is that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and correct me if I'm wrong,</v>

564
00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:45.430
<v Speaker 5>your conception is that the proper </v>
<v Speaker 5>pathway forward.</v>

565
00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:50.550
<v Speaker 5>So that would be the moral endeavor is </v>
<v Speaker 5>to move away from the bad and towards </v>

566
00:31:50.550 --> 00:31:50.550
<v Speaker 5>the good.</v>

567
00:31:50.550 --> 00:31:52.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so far as we understand which way is</v>

568
00:31:52.821 --> 00:31:53.370
<v Speaker 3>up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

569
00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:54.250
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

570
00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:57.720
<v Speaker 3>The basic claim is that we can be right </v>
<v Speaker 3>or wrong with respect to,</v>

571
00:31:58.120 --> 00:31:59.000
<v Speaker 3>to release.</v>

572
00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:04.700
<v Speaker 5>We don't necessarily know how to do that</v>
<v Speaker 5>in an uncaring manner and we could </v>

573
00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:08.840
<v Speaker 5>subject that to approximation correction</v>
<v Speaker 5>along the way and we should.</v>

574
00:32:09.050 --> 00:32:14.050
<v Speaker 5>But we can outline the broad scheme </v>
<v Speaker 5>which is progressive way from hell </v>

575
00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:15.560
<v Speaker 5>towards something that's positive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

576
00:32:15.650 --> 00:32:16.250
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

577
00:32:16.251 --> 00:32:19.940
<v Speaker 5>So I would say that there is an implicit</v>
<v Speaker 5>claim in that,</v>

578
00:32:20.270 --> 00:32:24.800
<v Speaker 5>that you should sacrifice everything in </v>
<v Speaker 5>you that isn't serving that to that.</v>

579
00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:30.100
<v Speaker 5>And I would say that that's essentially </v>
<v Speaker 5>the same claim that's made in </v>

580
00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:30.100
<v Speaker 5>Christianity.</v>

581
00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:30.100
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

582
00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:34.870
<v Speaker 3>that is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand the impulse to up level </v>

583
00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:42.890
<v Speaker 3>these ignorance derived beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

584
00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:47.990
<v Speaker 3>To something that is morally that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting and palatable in the current</v>

585
00:32:47.991 --> 00:32:51.350
<v Speaker 3>context.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I understand you can do that.</v>

586
00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:53.690
<v Speaker 3>My concern there is you can do that with</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

587
00:32:53.691 --> 00:32:58.691
<v Speaker 3>I mean you could do it with witchcraft.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why not do the exact same thing you're </v>

588
00:32:58.691 --> 00:33:01.400
<v Speaker 3>doing with religion to the history of </v>
<v Speaker 3>witchcraft.</v>

589
00:33:01.401 --> 00:33:02.930
<v Speaker 3>Witchcraft is as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>

590
00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:05.090
<v Speaker 3>as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Margaret Lynch's would do that.</v>

591
00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:08.050
<v Speaker 3>So that's a perfectly valid yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But so it's.</v>

592
00:33:08.150 --> 00:33:13.150
<v Speaker 3>But it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That should be of concern me that there </v>

593
00:33:13.150 --> 00:33:13.150
<v Speaker 3>are reasons why we don't want to endorse</v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

594
00:33:13.150 --> 00:33:14.080
<v Speaker 3>Modern witchcraft,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

595
00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:15.350
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

596
00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:20.380
<v Speaker 3>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're talking to and monitor </v>

597
00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:20.380
<v Speaker 3>witchcraft currently exists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

598
00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:20.930
<v Speaker 3>you go to Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're there.</v>

599
00:33:21.290 --> 00:33:26.290
<v Speaker 3>People are hunting albinos for their </v>
<v Speaker 3>body parts because they believe in </v>

600
00:33:26.290 --> 00:33:27.890
<v Speaker 3>sympathetic magic kit and kids get </v>
<v Speaker 3>killed as witches.</v>

601
00:33:27.891 --> 00:33:31.010
<v Speaker 3>So this belief endures in certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>pockets of humanity.</v>

602
00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:34.970
<v Speaker 3>And we're right to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think at a certain point you have</v>

603
00:33:34.971 --> 00:33:39.020
<v Speaker 3>to acknowledge that some ideas are not </v>
<v Speaker 3>only wrong,</v>

604
00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:44.050
<v Speaker 3>but they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their effects are disastrous or have </v>

605
00:33:44.050 --> 00:33:47.741
<v Speaker 3>been disastrous or will likely be even </v>
<v Speaker 3>if good in certain circumstances will </v>

606
00:33:47.741 --> 00:33:51.761
<v Speaker 3>likely be disastrous in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we shouldn't be hostage to </v>

607
00:33:51.761 --> 00:33:52.850
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these ancient memes.</v>

608
00:33:52.851 --> 00:33:57.851
<v Speaker 3>We shouldn't have to figure out how to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make the most of the worst idea that </v>

609
00:33:57.851 --> 00:34:00.300
<v Speaker 3>anyone's ever had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is you should make,</v>

610
00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:03.990
<v Speaker 6>you should sacrifice your first born </v>
<v Speaker 6>child to</v>

611
00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:06.000
<v Speaker 3>and you've never seen.</v>

612
00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:11.080
<v Speaker 1>Hold on Sam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to hold your feet to the fire </v>

613
00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:11.080
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

614
00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:13.460
<v Speaker 1>Two points.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One interesting observation.</v>

615
00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:16.880
<v Speaker 1>When you presented the example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so on your podcast,</v>

616
00:34:16.881 --> 00:34:19.440
<v Speaker 1>I had argued that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

617
00:34:19.610 --> 00:34:24.610
<v Speaker 1>believing that porcupines can throw </v>
<v Speaker 1>their quills might protect you from a </v>

618
00:34:24.610 --> 00:34:27.941
<v Speaker 1>porcupine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That might we'll around even though </v>

619
00:34:27.941 --> 00:34:29.690
<v Speaker 1>porcupines can't throw their quills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your listener sent the better example,</v>

620
00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:33.860
<v Speaker 1>which was all guns are loaded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you presented it,</v>

621
00:34:33.861 --> 00:34:36.260
<v Speaker 1>you didn't say all guns are loaded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

622
00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:38.960
<v Speaker 1>you said treat all guns as if they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>loaded,</v>

623
00:34:38.961 --> 00:34:43.250
<v Speaker 1>which is I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same or reflects that you have faced</v>

624
00:34:43.251 --> 00:34:47.090
<v Speaker 1>with any metaphorical truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that it can always be unpacked,</v>

625
00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:52.120
<v Speaker 3>but it's actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the way Jordan talks about </v>

626
00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:52.120
<v Speaker 3>believing in God as well.</v>

627
00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:52.270
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and actually so,</v>

628
00:34:52.490 --> 00:34:57.490
<v Speaker 1>so this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then if we take something like a </v>

629
00:34:57.490 --> 00:34:57.490
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you say,</v>

630
00:34:57.490 --> 00:34:59.860
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice of children is abhorrent,</v>

631
00:35:00.290 --> 00:35:02.800
<v Speaker 1>let's say it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you say,</v>

632
00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:07.920
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity hasn't a foregone the </v>

633
00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:11.191
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice of children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact it's described one child who is </v>

634
00:35:11.191 --> 00:35:14.611
<v Speaker 1>sacrificed for everybody else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but arguably that's an upgrade of some </v>

635
00:35:14.921 --> 00:35:19.120
<v Speaker 1>metaphorical truth that freeze those who</v>
<v Speaker 1>are adhering to this tradition from ever</v>

636
00:35:19.121 --> 00:35:24.121
<v Speaker 1>considering sacrificing your child and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what it does is it provides a </v>

637
00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:30.510
<v Speaker 1>motivational structure that may in fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>have very positive outgrowths though not</v>

638
00:35:30.821 --> 00:35:35.821
<v Speaker 1>literal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that someone would have </v>

639
00:35:35.821 --> 00:35:38.160
<v Speaker 1>sacrificed their own child for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefit of everybody else,</v>

640
00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:43.340
<v Speaker 1>not to have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That idea might engender a large amount </v>

641
00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:48.280
<v Speaker 1>of good work that would result as </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jordan.</v>

642
00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:51.350
<v Speaker 3>Let me just concede that the hardest </v>
<v Speaker 3>case for me,</v>

643
00:35:51.351 --> 00:35:56.210
<v Speaker 3>I met with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I did up top just in defining when</v>

644
00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:58.730
<v Speaker 3>after you define metaphorical truth and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I use the gun example,</v>

645
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:04.000
<v Speaker 3>there's certainly cases where the useful</v>
<v Speaker 3>fiction is more useful than the truth.</v>

646
00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:10.750
<v Speaker 3>I would grant that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think those cases are few and far </v>

647
00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:11.870
<v Speaker 3>between,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but handling guns is one of them.</v>

648
00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:17.170
<v Speaker 3>It's just not useful when the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When the casino opens across the street </v>

649
00:36:17.170 --> 00:36:17.170
<v Speaker 3>and you can play some million dollar </v>
<v Speaker 3>bet,</v>

650
00:36:17.170 --> 00:36:17.900
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you want,</v>

651
00:36:18.250 --> 00:36:20.930
<v Speaker 3>you want to have some purchase on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>literal truth so you want to be able to.</v>

652
00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:24.740
<v Speaker 3>And again this is psychologically </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting because,</v>

653
00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:30.960
<v Speaker 3>and I keep coming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>coming back to the gun example because </v>

654
00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:31.160
<v Speaker 3>the one that that is viscerally real to </v>
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>

655
00:36:31.161 --> 00:36:35.480
<v Speaker 3>like if I have a real gun that I know to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be unloaded,</v>

656
00:36:36.110 --> 00:36:40.670
<v Speaker 3>I still emotionally can't treat it as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>harmless object.</v>

657
00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:45.670
<v Speaker 3>I can't pointed at my child just for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fun of it because you know that we're </v>

658
00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:48.230
<v Speaker 3>going to play cops and robbers and now </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a real gun,</v>

659
00:36:48.231 --> 00:36:49.120
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>

660
00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:50.390
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have A.</v>

661
00:36:50.391 --> 00:36:55.391
<v Speaker 3>I have a superstitious attachment to </v>
<v Speaker 3>always being safe with a gun,</v>

662
00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:56.600
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>edit,</v>

663
00:36:56.780 --> 00:37:01.780
<v Speaker 3>and it's important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's important that that gets ingrained </v>

664
00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:05.560
<v Speaker 3>and yet it is not strictly raw if it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>not irrational because it has good </v>

665
00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:09.701
<v Speaker 3>effects,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not actually in register with </v>

666
00:37:09.701 --> 00:37:10.940
<v Speaker 3>what I know to be true factually in each</v>
<v Speaker 3>moment.</v>

667
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.080
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So very low cost,</v>

668
00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:15.200
<v Speaker 3>very low cost,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very low cost.</v>

669
00:37:15.201 --> 00:37:18.380
<v Speaker 3>It's not divided societies and causing </v>
<v Speaker 3>people to go to war</v>

670
00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:21.280
<v Speaker 1>and if you were going to teach a child </v>
<v Speaker 1>gun safety,</v>

671
00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:26.400
<v Speaker 1>you would want to encode this so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they would automatically know never to </v>

672
00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:30.121
<v Speaker 1>behave as if a gun is unloaded because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what gets you into trouble as an </v>

673
00:37:30.121 --> 00:37:30.160
<v Speaker 1>adult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every,</v>

674
00:37:30.190 --> 00:37:35.190
<v Speaker 1>every gun owner recognizes the </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinction between the metaphorical </v>

675
00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:39.301
<v Speaker 1>truth in the literal truth here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I guess what I suspect is going on </v>

676
00:37:39.371 --> 00:37:44.371
<v Speaker 1>here is that your mechanism for dealing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the world involves unpacking all of</v>

677
00:37:47.231 --> 00:37:49.270
<v Speaker 1>these things and I think it's highly </v>
<v Speaker 1>productive,</v>

678
00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:54.300
<v Speaker 1>but it also means that you have a hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>time understanding why anybody would do </v>

679
00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:58.651
<v Speaker 1>anything different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the question is just because </v>

680
00:37:58.651 --> 00:38:01.060
<v Speaker 1>we can track fully the difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>between guns.</v>

681
00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:05.200
<v Speaker 1>Actually all being loaded and behaving </v>
<v Speaker 1>as if all guns are loaded,</v>

682
00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:05.980
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That one,</v>

683
00:38:05.981 --> 00:38:07.900
<v Speaker 1>there's no leftover,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing,</v>

684
00:38:07.930 --> 00:38:09.470
<v Speaker 1>there's no mystery there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

685
00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:14.670
<v Speaker 1>But there may be many of these things </v>
<v Speaker 1>for which there is some difficulty </v>

686
00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:18.391
<v Speaker 1>lining up the metaphorical truth with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the literal truth and operating </v>

687
00:38:18.391 --> 00:38:20.800
<v Speaker 1>according to the metaphorical truth </v>
<v Speaker 1>might have advantages,</v>

688
00:38:20.801 --> 00:38:23.800
<v Speaker 1>which I think is what your getting at so</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

689
00:38:23.801 --> 00:38:26.080
<v Speaker 1>So here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's another situation,</v>

690
00:38:26.081 --> 00:38:31.081
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to remember what kind of </v>

691
00:38:31.081 --> 00:38:31.081
<v Speaker 1>catastrophic past we emerged from.</v>

692
00:38:31.081 --> 00:38:33.840
<v Speaker 3>How much privation ruled the world prior</v>
<v Speaker 3>to 18,</v>

693
00:38:33.841 --> 00:38:36.190
<v Speaker 3>95 essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and certainly</v>

694
00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:38.800
<v Speaker 5>the farther back you go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the more bloody and horrible it was.</v>

695
00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:42.670
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how often do you think it was necessary,</v>

696
00:38:42.671 --> 00:38:47.671
<v Speaker 5>and this is not obviously something I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>in favor of and this is also one of </v>

697
00:38:47.671 --> 00:38:51.691
<v Speaker 5>these situations where we get to play </v>
<v Speaker 5>with ideas that we might not otherwise </v>

698
00:38:51.691 --> 00:38:55.081
<v Speaker 5>play with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How often do you think it was necessary </v>

699
00:38:55.081 --> 00:38:58.231
<v Speaker 5>for people in the past who had </v>
<v Speaker 5>absolutely no access to birth control </v>

700
00:38:58.231 --> 00:39:02.100
<v Speaker 5>and who didn't have enough food to </v>
<v Speaker 5>sacrifice a child for the survival of </v>

701
00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:05.410
<v Speaker 5>their family mean God only knows and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's it?</v>

702
00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:07.690
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's worth thinking about.</v>

703
00:39:07.691 --> 00:39:08.870
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

704
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:14.000
<v Speaker 5>life is unbelievably cruel and difficult</v>
<v Speaker 5>and one of the problems that comes when </v>

705
00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.911
<v Speaker 5>you discover the future is that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>might have to make the most painful of </v>

706
00:39:17.911 --> 00:39:20.260
<v Speaker 5>sacrifices and lots of lots of archaic </v>
<v Speaker 5>people do this sort of thing.</v>

707
00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:23.200
<v Speaker 5>They do that with their elderly people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They do that with sick people.</v>

708
00:39:23.201 --> 00:39:28.201
<v Speaker 5>They do that with infants that they </v>
<v Speaker 5>deemed too fragile to survive like so </v>

709
00:39:28.201 --> 00:39:32.431
<v Speaker 5>part of child sacrifice,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I know the literature on child </v>

710
00:39:32.431 --> 00:39:34.300
<v Speaker 5>sacrifice reasonably well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Part of child sacrifice seemed to emerge</v>

711
00:39:34.301 --> 00:39:39.301
<v Speaker 5>out of the observable necessity to leave</v>
<v Speaker 5>someone behind so that everyone else </v>

712
00:39:40.331 --> 00:39:44.230
<v Speaker 5>didn't die and we don't know how often </v>
<v Speaker 5>that had to happen in the past.</v>

713
00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:47.470
<v Speaker 5>It might've had to happen a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right now,</v>

714
00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:51.850
<v Speaker 5>obviously just just in the interest of </v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of conceptual clarity here,</v>

715
00:39:51.970 --> 00:39:55.630
<v Speaker 5>human sacrifice is a larger horror than </v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

716
00:39:55.631 --> 00:39:58.960
<v Speaker 5>so you have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was very common is the sacrificing of</v>

717
00:39:58.961 --> 00:40:03.961
<v Speaker 5>other captives.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They didn't take the Aztec sacrifices </v>

718
00:40:03.961 --> 00:40:03.961
<v Speaker 5>where you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you now have slaves,</v>

719
00:40:03.961 --> 00:40:06.880
<v Speaker 5>some of whom you're going to have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The aztecs sacrificed about 25,000</v>

720
00:40:06.881 --> 00:40:08.310
<v Speaker 5>people a year.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

721
00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:10.900
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's clearly a bloody mess.</v>

722
00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:12.790
<v Speaker 5>There's no doubt about that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

723
00:40:12.791 --> 00:40:15.370
<v Speaker 5>one of the things that you see happening</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the biblical narrative,</v>

724
00:40:15.371 --> 00:40:20.371
<v Speaker 5>which is extraordinarily interesting is </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you see echoes of child sacrifice </v>

725
00:40:20.371 --> 00:40:24.241
<v Speaker 5>at the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but what happens is the sacrificial </v>

726
00:40:24.241 --> 00:40:24.820
<v Speaker 5>notion gets increasingly psychologized </v>
<v Speaker 5>as the story progresses.</v>

727
00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:28.510
<v Speaker 5>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you see that transition with Abraham and</v>

728
00:40:28.511 --> 00:40:32.260
<v Speaker 5>Isaac were the were the sec or the child</v>
<v Speaker 5>sacrifice is actually forbidden,</v>

729
00:40:32.290 --> 00:40:36.520
<v Speaker 5>although previously demanded by God and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then you also see it as you already laid</v>

730
00:40:36.521 --> 00:40:41.521
<v Speaker 5>out in the substitution of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>circumcision for the idea of sacrifice </v>

731
00:40:41.521 --> 00:40:42.550
<v Speaker 5>itself and then what seems to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>

732
00:40:42.551 --> 00:40:47.551
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to figure out how these ideas</v>
<v Speaker 5>developed site psychologically from </v>

733
00:40:47.551 --> 00:40:50.761
<v Speaker 5>their behavioral underpinnings is that </v>
<v Speaker 5>eventually it becomes psychologized </v>

734
00:40:50.761 --> 00:40:51.130
<v Speaker 5>completely so you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

735
00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:56.400
<v Speaker 5>we can.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We can conceptualize a sacrifice in the </v>

736
00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:58.981
<v Speaker 5>abstract so my parents can sacrifice to </v>
<v Speaker 5>send me to university without anything </v>

737
00:40:58.981 --> 00:40:59.980
<v Speaker 5>or anyone having to die.</v>

738
00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:05.280
<v Speaker 5>It transforms itself from something </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's enacted out as a dramatic ritual </v>

739
00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:06.010
<v Speaker 5>into something that's a psychological </v>
<v Speaker 5>reality,</v>

740
00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:11.280
<v Speaker 5>but all that blood and catastrophe along</v>
<v Speaker 5>the way as part of the process by which </v>

741
00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:14.380
<v Speaker 5>the idea comes to emerge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what is the connection of all of this</v>

742
00:41:14.381 --> 00:41:19.381
<v Speaker 5>because so there there is this history </v>
<v Speaker 5>and I would argue we are busily trying </v>

743
00:41:20.651 --> 00:41:23.920
<v Speaker 5>to outgrow much of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if not most of it,</v>

744
00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:29.320
<v Speaker 5>and whether its evolutionary history or </v>
<v Speaker 5>just trying to transmute it so that it </v>

745
00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:30.520
<v Speaker 5>becomes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We can,</v>

746
00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:33.230
<v Speaker 5>we can maintain as you suggested,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we do.</v>

747
00:41:33.231 --> 00:41:38.231
<v Speaker 5>We can maintain what's useful in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>tradition and throw out everything </v>

748
00:41:38.231 --> 00:41:38.231
<v Speaker 5>that's pathologic.</v>

749
00:41:38.231 --> 00:41:42.200
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we're constantly discovering a lack </v>

750
00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:46.290
<v Speaker 3>of fit between both our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we perceive ourselves as biological</v>

751
00:41:46.350 --> 00:41:51.350
<v Speaker 3>imperatives and the cultural legacies of</v>
<v Speaker 3>just what Mommy and daddy taught me was </v>

752
00:41:51.350 --> 00:41:51.900
<v Speaker 3>true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

753
00:41:51.901 --> 00:41:56.901
<v Speaker 3>which we have now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every reason to believe might not be </v>

754
00:41:56.901 --> 00:41:59.991
<v Speaker 3>true and we're trying to optimize our </v>
<v Speaker 3>thoughts and institutions and and </v>

755
00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:06.540
<v Speaker 3>relationships with one another for our </v>
<v Speaker 3>current circumstance,</v>

756
00:42:06.541 --> 00:42:11.541
<v Speaker 3>and yet we have this legacy effect of </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain books and certain ways of </v>

757
00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:17.630
<v Speaker 3>speaking have a completely different </v>
<v Speaker 3>status and they have the status because </v>

758
00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:22.760
<v Speaker 3>they may in fact it's imagined not be </v>
<v Speaker 3>the products of merely previous human </v>

759
00:42:24.301 --> 00:42:29.301
<v Speaker 3>minds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they may be the products of </v>

760
00:42:29.301 --> 00:42:31.401
<v Speaker 3>omniscience and that this is where the </v>
<v Speaker 3>respect accorded to religious tradition </v>

761
00:42:32.130 --> 00:42:36.360
<v Speaker 3>is totally unlike the respect we would </v>
<v Speaker 3>accord to anything else.</v>

762
00:42:36.750 --> 00:42:39.120
<v Speaker 3>Mythology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>literature,</v>

763
00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:41.550
<v Speaker 3>past science,</v>
<v Speaker 3>past philosophy.</v>

764
00:42:41.551 --> 00:42:46.551
<v Speaker 3>I mean people can read Plato and </v>
<v Speaker 3>aristotle for their entire lives without</v>

765
00:42:46.961 --> 00:42:50.970
<v Speaker 3>ever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>without ever being fully captured by the</v>

766
00:42:50.971 --> 00:42:55.971
<v Speaker 3>kind of dogmatism that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that every religion demands that you be </v>

767
00:42:56.581 --> 00:43:01.581
<v Speaker 3>captured.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're really going to be an </v>

768
00:43:01.581 --> 00:43:01.581
<v Speaker 3>adherence.</v>

769
00:43:01.581 --> 00:43:01.581
<v Speaker 5>I say that's actually an archetypal </v>
<v Speaker 5>truth.</v>

770
00:43:01.581 --> 00:43:05.060
<v Speaker 5>You know the idea that the pathological </v>
<v Speaker 5>tradition stands in the way of update.</v>

771
00:43:05.330 --> 00:43:06.650
<v Speaker 5>That's an archetypal truth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

772
00:43:06.651 --> 00:43:09.120
<v Speaker 5>one of the reasons why in creation </v>
<v Speaker 5>myths,</v>

773
00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:14.140
<v Speaker 5>one of the variants of a creation myth </v>
<v Speaker 5>is that the hero has to slay a </v>

774
00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:16.871
<v Speaker 5>tyrannical giant in order to make it </v>
<v Speaker 5>make the world out of his pieces and </v>

775
00:43:16.871 --> 00:43:20.960
<v Speaker 5>it's a metaphorical restatement of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>idea that tradition can become hidebound</v>

776
00:43:21.050 --> 00:43:26.050
<v Speaker 5>and when it becomes hidebound and too </v>
<v Speaker 5>rigid that it interferes with current </v>

777
00:43:26.050 --> 00:43:26.050
<v Speaker 5>adaptation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the problem is,</v>

778
00:43:26.050 --> 00:43:29.270
<v Speaker 5>and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think this is something we really need</v>

779
00:43:29.271 --> 00:43:34.271
<v Speaker 5>to hash out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The problem is the problem that you're </v>

780
00:43:34.271 --> 00:43:34.370
<v Speaker 5>describing is the problem of a priori </v>
<v Speaker 5>structure.</v>

781
00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:35.780
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some of that's textual,</v>

782
00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:41.200
<v Speaker 5>but some of it isn't textual.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some of it resides in us as our psyche </v>

783
00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:41.200
<v Speaker 5>in so far say</v>

784
00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:46.000
<v Speaker 3>no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm I'm describing here is that we have </v>

785
00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.530
<v Speaker 3>two categories of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of books in this case,</v>

786
00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:53.560
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have those written by people like </v>

787
00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:56.411
<v Speaker 3>ourselves just endlessly open for </v>
<v Speaker 3>criticism and and conjecture and those </v>

788
00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:00.380
<v Speaker 3>written by invisible omniscient.</v>

789
00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:05.870
<v Speaker 5>But I would presume that if these </v>
<v Speaker 5>religious systems weren't codafide in </v>

790
00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:08.951
<v Speaker 5>books,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if they were still just enacted or </v>

791
00:44:08.951 --> 00:44:08.951
<v Speaker 5>dramatized,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'd have the same objection.</v>

792
00:44:08.951 --> 00:44:10.280
<v Speaker 5>It's not the fact that they're in books </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's relevant,</v>

793
00:44:10.281 --> 00:44:12.710
<v Speaker 5>but it is the dogmatism is the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 5>we can't.</v>

794
00:44:12.711 --> 00:44:14.930
<v Speaker 5>We can't jettison bad part.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

795
00:44:14.931 --> 00:44:16.130
<v Speaker 5>It's the dogmatism.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

796
00:44:16.131 --> 00:44:18.620
<v Speaker 5>So to me that's the same as the problem </v>
<v Speaker 5>of structure.</v>

797
00:44:18.890 --> 00:44:19.970
<v Speaker 5>Now here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's the.</v>

798
00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:25.030
<v Speaker 5>Here's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think with the way that your argument </v>

799
00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:25.430
<v Speaker 5>is laid out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I'm not saying it's wrong,</v>

800
00:44:25.610 --> 00:44:28.850
<v Speaker 5>it seems to me that this is a place </v>
<v Speaker 5>where it needs to be developed because I</v>

801
00:44:28.851 --> 00:44:33.840
<v Speaker 5>see that the attempt that you make to </v>
<v Speaker 5>derive the value from the world of facts</v>

802
00:44:33.841 --> 00:44:37.620
<v Speaker 5>as as justifiable given what it is that </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're attempting to do,</v>

803
00:44:37.621 --> 00:44:39.780
<v Speaker 5>which in principle is to make the world </v>
<v Speaker 5>a better place.</v>

804
00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:42.720
<v Speaker 5>But there's a massive gap in there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like how do you do it?</v>

805
00:44:42.990 --> 00:44:45.840
<v Speaker 5>Because the objection that you place on </v>
<v Speaker 5>my,</v>

806
00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:47.250
<v Speaker 5>my reasoning,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say,</v>

807
00:44:47.251 --> 00:44:47.910
<v Speaker 5>which is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

808
00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:53.150
<v Speaker 5>the problem with these texts is that </v>
<v Speaker 5>there's an infinite number of </v>

809
00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:53.150
<v Speaker 5>interpretations and which of them can </v>
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

810
00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:57.290
<v Speaker 5>How can you determine which of those is </v>
<v Speaker 5>canonically correct is exactly and </v>

811
00:44:57.290 --> 00:45:01.041
<v Speaker 5>precisely the same criticism that can be</v>
<v Speaker 5>levied against your attempt to extract </v>

812
00:45:01.041 --> 00:45:01.710
<v Speaker 5>the world of value from the domain of </v>
<v Speaker 5>facts.</v>

813
00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:02.880
<v Speaker 5>It's the same.</v>

814
00:45:03.570 --> 00:45:06.220
<v Speaker 3>It's not an infinite number of </v>
<v Speaker 3>interpretations in either case,</v>

815
00:45:06.221 --> 00:45:10.110
<v Speaker 3>but I allow for enough to infinite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that might be.</v>

816
00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:15.120
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's why the moral landscape </v>
<v Speaker 3>for me is a landscape of peaks and </v>

817
00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:15.120
<v Speaker 3>valleys and so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

818
00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:19.820
<v Speaker 3>I am totally open to the possibility in </v>
<v Speaker 3>fact certainty that there are different </v>

819
00:45:20.561 --> 00:45:25.561
<v Speaker 3>ways for similar minds and certainly </v>
<v Speaker 3>different ways for different minds to be</v>

820
00:45:27.370 --> 00:45:32.370
<v Speaker 3>constellated so that they have </v>
<v Speaker 3>equivalent but irreconcilable peaks on </v>

821
00:45:33.371 --> 00:45:34.330
<v Speaker 3>the landscape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you,</v>

822
00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:36.820
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of wellbeing over here and</v>

823
00:45:36.821 --> 00:45:39.640
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of wellbeing over here and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a valley in between.</v>

824
00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:42.370
<v Speaker 3>And so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a kind of moral relativism.</v>

825
00:45:42.371 --> 00:45:43.060
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

826
00:45:43.061 --> 00:45:45.280
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is great and this is great,</v>

827
00:45:45.281 --> 00:45:46.630
<v Speaker 3>but these are irreconcilable.</v>

828
00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:51.900
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd like to see that made more concrete </v>

829
00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:53.891
<v Speaker 5>and I need to know how that fits in with</v>
<v Speaker 5>your conception because one of the </v>

830
00:45:53.891 --> 00:45:57.401
<v Speaker 5>claims that you make in the moral </v>
<v Speaker 5>landscape is that the distinction </v>

831
00:45:57.401 --> 00:46:00.521
<v Speaker 5>between the bad life and the good life </v>
<v Speaker 5>is normally it's like it's a factual </v>

832
00:46:01.311 --> 00:46:02.200
<v Speaker 5>distinction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

833
00:46:02.210 --> 00:46:06.170
<v Speaker 5>it's universally,</v>
<v Speaker 5>universally apprehensible and true.</v>

834
00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:11.200
<v Speaker 5>It's your.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's your fundamental axiomatic </v>

835
00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:13.781
<v Speaker 5>claim and I don't see how that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>commensurate with the position that you </v>

836
00:46:13.781 --> 00:46:13.781
<v Speaker 5>just put forward.</v>

837
00:46:13.781 --> 00:46:18.150
<v Speaker 3>Was it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So here's the position and you can </v>

838
00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:19.410
<v Speaker 3>forget about morality as a concept for </v>
<v Speaker 3>this man.</v>

839
00:46:19.411 --> 00:46:22.290
<v Speaker 3>I think the starting point is deeper </v>
<v Speaker 3>than morality.</v>

840
00:46:22.291 --> 00:46:23.610
<v Speaker 3>The starting point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is all,</v>

841
00:46:23.730 --> 00:46:27.900
<v Speaker 3>this is our starting point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of us right now in the universe,</v>

842
00:46:27.930 --> 00:46:31.430
<v Speaker 3>the starting point is we are conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

843
00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:36.440
<v Speaker 3>We have a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have a circumstance that admits of </v>

844
00:46:36.690 --> 00:46:41.610
<v Speaker 3>qualitative experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>

845
00:46:41.611 --> 00:46:42.630
<v Speaker 3>this is true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever,</v>

846
00:46:42.631 --> 00:46:45.720
<v Speaker 3>however we understand consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever is actually happening,</v>

847
00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:48.510
<v Speaker 3>they could be living in a simulation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This could be a dream.</v>

848
00:46:48.810 --> 00:46:53.810
<v Speaker 3>You could be a brain in a Vat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A consciousness could just be the </v>

849
00:46:53.810 --> 00:46:56.460
<v Speaker 3>product of neurochemistry or we could </v>
<v Speaker 3>have eternal souls running on on,</v>

850
00:46:56.620 --> 00:46:58.320
<v Speaker 3>so how he is somehow integrated with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>brain.</v>

851
00:46:58.950 --> 00:47:03.950
<v Speaker 3>Whatever is true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something seems to be happening and the </v>

852
00:47:03.950 --> 00:47:07.680
<v Speaker 3>Siemens can be really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really bad or really,</v>

853
00:47:07.681 --> 00:47:10.200
<v Speaker 3>really good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know each one of us in our lives have</v>

854
00:47:10.201 --> 00:47:13.050
<v Speaker 3>experienced this range of possibility </v>
<v Speaker 3>and yes,</v>

855
00:47:13.051 --> 00:47:17.340
<v Speaker 3>there are caveats here and there are </v>
<v Speaker 3>hard and painful experiences that have a</v>

856
00:47:17.341 --> 00:47:18.360
<v Speaker 3>silver lining,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

857
00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:20.160
<v Speaker 3>That give you some other capacity where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can say,</v>

858
00:47:20.161 --> 00:47:20.970
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

859
00:47:20.971 --> 00:47:23.520
<v Speaker 3>that really sucked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm a better person for it.</v>

860
00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:28.580
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we can understand what it means to </v>

861
00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:28.580
<v Speaker 3>be a better person for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In terms,</v>

862
00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:30.130
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of this range of experience,</v>

863
00:47:30.131 --> 00:47:30.610
<v Speaker 3>which I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

864
00:47:30.611 --> 00:47:35.611
<v Speaker 3>I'm calling subsuming all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the positive end of this as well being,</v>

865
00:47:36.190 --> 00:47:38.920
<v Speaker 3>which is to say that you now I'm a </v>
<v Speaker 3>better person for it because now,</v>

866
00:47:39.220 --> 00:47:41.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>having endured that ordeal,</v>

867
00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:46.300
<v Speaker 3>I am capable of much greater compassion </v>
<v Speaker 3>where I appreciate my life more.</v>

868
00:47:46.301 --> 00:47:48.220
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cancer made me a better person.</v>

869
00:47:48.221 --> 00:47:49.840
<v Speaker 3>Now that I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm cured.</v>

870
00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:52.450
<v Speaker 3>I value each moment of life more than I </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever did.</v>

871
00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:57.960
<v Speaker 3>All of these claims are intelligible </v>
<v Speaker 3>within a context of an open ended </v>

872
00:47:57.960 --> 00:48:00.580
<v Speaker 3>context of exploring this space of </v>
<v Speaker 3>possible experience.</v>

873
00:48:01.090 --> 00:48:03.310
<v Speaker 3>So what I'm saying is forget about </v>
<v Speaker 3>morality.</v>

874
00:48:03.790 --> 00:48:05.470
<v Speaker 3>Forget about right and wrong and good </v>
<v Speaker 3>and evil.</v>

875
00:48:05.950 --> 00:48:10.950
<v Speaker 3>What is undeniable is that what we have </v>
<v Speaker 3>here is a navigation problem.</v>

876
00:48:11.890 --> 00:48:15.220
<v Speaker 3>We have a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a space of possible experience.</v>

877
00:48:15.730 --> 00:48:17.680
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not just a human problem.</v>

878
00:48:17.681 --> 00:48:19.990
<v Speaker 3>This is a problem for any possible </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscious mind.</v>

879
00:48:21.370 --> 00:48:26.370
<v Speaker 3>We have a space of possible experience </v>
<v Speaker 3>in which we can navigate and we and </v>

880
00:48:26.370 --> 00:48:30.481
<v Speaker 3>things can get excruciating and </v>
<v Speaker 3>pointlessly horrible where there are no </v>

881
00:48:30.881 --> 00:48:32.620
<v Speaker 3>silver linings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we get this.</v>

882
00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:37.660
<v Speaker 3>This can happen individually in some </v>
<v Speaker 3>episode of madness that never ends.</v>

883
00:48:38.620 --> 00:48:40.930
<v Speaker 3>If there really is a Christian hell to </v>
<v Speaker 3>go to,</v>

884
00:48:40.931 --> 00:48:43.450
<v Speaker 3>well then it can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to happen to me after I die,</v>

885
00:48:43.451 --> 00:48:45.130
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Given what I've said on the stage,</v>

886
00:48:45.620 --> 00:48:47.530
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

887
00:48:47.531 --> 00:48:49.300
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it matters who's right.</v>

888
00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:51.950
<v Speaker 3>Obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I knew that a,</v>

889
00:48:52.110 --> 00:48:57.110
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an eternity of fiery torment awaited </v>

890
00:48:57.110 --> 00:48:59.110
<v Speaker 3>somebody who didn't make the right </v>
<v Speaker 3>noises about one or one faith or another</v>

891
00:48:59.111 --> 00:49:04.111
<v Speaker 3>will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it would only be rational to make </v>

892
00:49:04.111 --> 00:49:04.111
<v Speaker 3>those right noises,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

893
00:49:04.111 --> 00:49:04.111
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's my bet.</v>

894
00:49:04.111 --> 00:49:07.480
<v Speaker 3>I'm placing a bet on certain pictures of</v>
<v Speaker 3>reality being wrong.</v>

895
00:49:07.930 --> 00:49:12.930
<v Speaker 3>But the reality is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is we're navigating in this space and </v>

896
00:49:12.930 --> 00:49:16.831
<v Speaker 3>morality and ethics are the terms we use</v>
<v Speaker 3>for how we think about our behavior </v>

897
00:49:22.150 --> 00:49:25.390
<v Speaker 3>affecting one another is experienced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you're in a moral solitude,</v>

898
00:49:25.391 --> 00:49:29.050
<v Speaker 3>if you're on a desert island or if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're alone in the universe,</v>

899
00:49:29.620 --> 00:49:32.320
<v Speaker 3>morality is not the issue you need to </v>
<v Speaker 3>worry about.</v>

900
00:49:32.321 --> 00:49:34.660
<v Speaker 3>But wellbeing still is an ever present </v>
<v Speaker 3>issue.</v>

901
00:49:34.690 --> 00:49:39.590
<v Speaker 3>It's possible to suffer and as possible </v>
<v Speaker 3>to experience bliss and,</v>

902
00:49:39.591 --> 00:49:43.270
<v Speaker 3>and perhaps something beyond that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we,</v>

903
00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:48.160
<v Speaker 3>the horizon in both directions is </v>
<v Speaker 3>something we will,</v>

904
00:49:48.161 --> 00:49:49.840
<v Speaker 3>we'll never fully exposed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>explore,</v>

905
00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:54.860
<v Speaker 3>very likely in the way we don't know how</v>
<v Speaker 3>good things can get and we don't know </v>

906
00:49:54.860 --> 00:49:54.860
<v Speaker 3>how bad they can get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

907
00:49:54.860 --> 00:49:57.130
<v Speaker 3>but that there's a spectrum here is </v>
<v Speaker 3>undeniable.</v>

908
00:49:57.131 --> 00:49:58.420
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say that,</v>

909
00:49:58.780 --> 00:50:03.780
<v Speaker 3>that my moral realism simply entails </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we acknowledged that it's possible </v>

910
00:50:04.721 --> 00:50:08.470
<v Speaker 3>not to know what you're missing is </v>
<v Speaker 3>possible to be living in a way where you</v>

911
00:50:08.471 --> 00:50:11.980
<v Speaker 3>are less happy than you could be and not</v>
<v Speaker 3>to know why.</v>

912
00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:17.160
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And to not have the wisdom to make the </v>

913
00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:19.051
<v Speaker 3>changes and that matters if anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>matters that matters and it matters to </v>

914
00:50:19.051 --> 00:50:20.800
<v Speaker 3>us individually and it matters to us </v>
<v Speaker 3>collectively.</v>

915
00:50:21.220 --> 00:50:26.220
<v Speaker 3>And that mattering is our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that subsumes everything we can </v>

916
00:50:26.810 --> 00:50:29.660
<v Speaker 3>intelligibly want in this domain of </v>
<v Speaker 3>value.</v>

917
00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:31.700
<v Speaker 3>And that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so again,</v>

918
00:50:31.710 --> 00:50:33.070
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the,</v>

919
00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:38.100
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cash value of any value claim is in </v>

920
00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:41.231
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the actual or potential change in </v>

921
00:50:41.231 --> 00:50:42.350
<v Speaker 3>consciousness for some conscious system </v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere sometime.</v>

922
00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:43.370
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's my claim.</v>

923
00:50:43.371 --> 00:50:43.790
<v Speaker 3>And that's.</v>

924
00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:48.380
<v Speaker 2>Can I try to get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would like to clarify something.</v>

925
00:50:49.950 --> 00:50:51.630
<v Speaker 1>So it sounds to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sam,</v>

926
00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:56.740
<v Speaker 1>like you are hypothesizing that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rationalist approach will always beat a </v>

927
00:51:00.450 --> 00:51:05.370
<v Speaker 1>traditional metaphorical approach with </v>
<v Speaker 1>respect to the generation of wellbeing.</v>

928
00:51:05.930 --> 00:51:06.920
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not always,</v>

929
00:51:06.921 --> 00:51:11.921
<v Speaker 3>but there's so many obvious downsides to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the traditional sectarian dogmatic </v>

930
00:51:13.761 --> 00:51:18.761
<v Speaker 3>approach that we should want to get out </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the religion business as fast as </v>

931
00:51:18.761 --> 00:51:18.761
<v Speaker 3>possible.</v>

932
00:51:18.761 --> 00:51:18.761
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

933
00:51:18.761 --> 00:51:19.510
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as fast as possible.</v>

934
00:51:19.511 --> 00:51:24.511
<v Speaker 1>But do you mean that it has always been </v>
<v Speaker 1>true that we should always have gotten </v>

935
00:51:24.511 --> 00:51:29.221
<v Speaker 1>away from it as fast as possible or do </v>
<v Speaker 1>you mean now we should get away from it </v>

936
00:51:29.221 --> 00:51:33.511
<v Speaker 1>as fast as possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is a point somewhere in the </v>

937
00:51:33.511 --> 00:51:34.480
<v Speaker 1>past where it might have been true that </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually the best,</v>

938
00:51:34.481 --> 00:51:37.720
<v Speaker 1>the most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the richest path to wellbeing might have</v>

939
00:51:37.721 --> 00:51:39.130
<v Speaker 1>been encoded metaphorically.</v>

940
00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:41.710
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's certainly possible.</v>

941
00:51:41.740 --> 00:51:46.740
<v Speaker 3>And in fact you might even say it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>likely based on the fact that we have </v>

942
00:51:46.740 --> 00:51:47.410
<v Speaker 3>all of these systems still around.</v>

943
00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:50.990
<v Speaker 5>We still have the systems around in part</v>
<v Speaker 5>because our,</v>

944
00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:56.060
<v Speaker 5>like we still,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we still think in metaphor and we </v>

945
00:51:56.060 --> 00:51:58.790
<v Speaker 5>actually can't help it because half of </v>
<v Speaker 5>our brain is oriented towards metaphor.</v>

946
00:51:58.791 --> 00:51:59.000
<v Speaker 5>But</v>

947
00:51:59.460 --> 00:52:01.680
<v Speaker 1>can I get you to clarify something now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

948
00:52:01.710 --> 00:52:05.460
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have argued,</v>

949
00:52:05.461 --> 00:52:07.560
<v Speaker 1>and you've actually quite surprised me </v>
<v Speaker 1>by doing so.</v>

950
00:52:07.561 --> 00:52:12.090
<v Speaker 1>You argued that the dogmatism is a bug </v>
<v Speaker 1>and not a feature.</v>

951
00:52:12.660 --> 00:52:15.240
<v Speaker 1>You've argued it's a bug and a feature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

952
00:52:15.241 --> 00:52:16.350
<v Speaker 1>It's a bug and a feature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

953
00:52:16.351 --> 00:52:21.351
<v Speaker 1>So yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I thought I heard you say was </v>

954
00:52:21.351 --> 00:52:23.670
<v Speaker 1>that the resistance to update,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

955
00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:27.380
<v Speaker 1>was a problem that effectively it was an</v>
<v Speaker 1>obstacle yet.</v>

956
00:52:27.420 --> 00:52:30.720
<v Speaker 1>So his lack of resistance to update.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's problems everywhere,</v>

957
00:52:30.721 --> 00:52:31.410
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

958
00:52:31.590 --> 00:52:33.840
<v Speaker 2>there's a tension.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is a tension.</v>

959
00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:35.120
<v Speaker 2>Is tension.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Terrible.</v>

960
00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:38.100
<v Speaker 2>Look at it this way.</v>

961
00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:43.460
<v Speaker 5>Most new ideas are stupid and dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but most some of them are fighter as </v>

962
00:52:43.551 --> 00:52:45.240
<v Speaker 5>well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some of them are vital,</v>

963
00:52:45.750 --> 00:52:46.620
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so we have.</v>

964
00:52:46.650 --> 00:52:48.330
<v Speaker 5>We're screwed both ways.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

965
00:52:48.690 --> 00:52:50.850
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if we stay locked in our current mode of</v>

966
00:52:50.851 --> 00:52:53.700
<v Speaker 5>apprehension,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all hell's gonna break loose.</v>

967
00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:55.620
<v Speaker 5>If we generate a whole bunch of new </v>
<v Speaker 5>solutions,</v>

968
00:52:55.621 --> 00:52:57.390
<v Speaker 5>most of them are going to be wrong and </v>
<v Speaker 5>we're going to die.</v>

969
00:52:57.750 --> 00:53:02.210
<v Speaker 5>And so what we need to do is it's a </v>
<v Speaker 5>Darwinian claim in some sense,</v>

970
00:53:02.211 --> 00:53:05.850
<v Speaker 5>is that despite the fact that most new </v>
<v Speaker 5>ideas are stupid and dangerous,</v>

971
00:53:05.851 --> 00:53:08.460
<v Speaker 5>a subset of them are so vital that if we</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't incorporate them,</v>

972
00:53:08.461 --> 00:53:13.461
<v Speaker 5>we're all going to perish.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the bloody existential condition </v>

973
00:53:13.461 --> 00:53:14.550
<v Speaker 5>and so now and part of the issue here </v>
<v Speaker 5>and see,</v>

974
00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:19.870
<v Speaker 5>I think that this is the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that let's take the dogma idea.</v>

975
00:53:21.180 --> 00:53:23.010
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so there's the dogma incorporated in the</v>

976
00:53:23.011 --> 00:53:28.011
<v Speaker 5>books,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm gonna throw away the books </v>

977
00:53:28.011 --> 00:53:29.421
<v Speaker 5>because the dogma was there before the </v>
<v Speaker 5>books and then the question is where it </v>

978
00:53:29.421 --> 00:53:32.271
<v Speaker 5>was the dogma and the answer was the </v>
<v Speaker 5>dogma was in the cultural practices but </v>

979
00:53:32.271 --> 00:53:37.150
<v Speaker 5>and in and in the agreement that people </v>
<v Speaker 5>made with regards to those cultural </v>

980
00:53:37.150 --> 00:53:40.941
<v Speaker 5>practices,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was also part and parcel of the </v>

981
00:53:40.941 --> 00:53:42.240
<v Speaker 5>Inter psychic structure that enables us </v>
<v Speaker 5>to perceive the world as such.</v>

982
00:53:42.750 --> 00:53:47.750
<v Speaker 5>Now the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think this is the central place </v>

983
00:53:47.750 --> 00:53:51.291
<v Speaker 5>where we need to flesh out these ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that you cannot view the world </v>

984
00:53:51.291 --> 00:53:54.450
<v Speaker 5>without an a priori structure and that a</v>
<v Speaker 5>prior structure has a dogmatic element,</v>

985
00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:56.490
<v Speaker 5>and so you can't just say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

986
00:53:56.491 --> 00:53:58.810
<v Speaker 5>let's get rid of the dog one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because you can't perceive the world</v>

987
00:53:59.190 --> 00:54:04.190
<v Speaker 3>structure has an uninspected element.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because if you're talking about just </v>

988
00:54:04.190 --> 00:54:04.990
<v Speaker 3>perceiving the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes we have.</v>

989
00:54:05.140 --> 00:54:10.120
<v Speaker 3>We have perceptual structure that allows</v>
<v Speaker 3>for us to perceive the world and we know</v>

990
00:54:10.630 --> 00:54:12.790
<v Speaker 3>that there are failures states,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

991
00:54:12.791 --> 00:54:13.780
<v Speaker 3>So we know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we know for instance,</v>

992
00:54:13.781 --> 00:54:14.980
<v Speaker 3>that we are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are,</v>

993
00:54:14.981 --> 00:54:19.981
<v Speaker 3>we have evolved to perceive visual space</v>
<v Speaker 3>based on a literally neurological </v>

994
00:54:22.331 --> 00:54:25.180
<v Speaker 3>expectation that light sources will be </v>
<v Speaker 3>from above.</v>

995
00:54:25.210 --> 00:54:30.210
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we know that we can produce </v>

996
00:54:30.210 --> 00:54:30.210
<v Speaker 3>visual illusions based on gaming that </v>
<v Speaker 3>expectation.</v>

997
00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:33.560
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's not the same thing as a,</v>

998
00:54:34.350 --> 00:54:39.350
<v Speaker 3>a dogma we subscribed to by some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some subset of humanity that is </v>

999
00:54:40.691 --> 00:54:45.691
<v Speaker 3>antithetical to another dogma subscribed</v>
<v Speaker 3>to by another set of humanity that has </v>

1000
00:54:45.691 --> 00:54:48.700
<v Speaker 3>nothing to do with underlying biology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's something that is changeable,</v>

1001
00:54:48.701 --> 00:54:53.701
<v Speaker 3>obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody's changeable in real time based </v>

1002
00:54:53.701 --> 00:54:54.290
<v Speaker 3>on just conversations like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1003
00:54:54.291 --> 00:54:54.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we could,</v>

1004
00:54:55.120 --> 00:55:00.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get emails from people who can point </v>

1005
00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:03.331
<v Speaker 3>to these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the paragraph where they lost their </v>

1006
00:55:03.331 --> 00:55:03.331
<v Speaker 3>faith,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1007
00:55:03.331 --> 00:55:07.500
<v Speaker 3>Where in reading somebody's reading,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reading Richard Dawkins or newborn </v>

1008
00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:10.500
<v Speaker 3>hearing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a debate between between me and some </v>

1009
00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:13.530
<v Speaker 3>theologian where it's just a was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>collision against rationality,</v>

1010
00:55:13.630 --> 00:55:18.630
<v Speaker 3>which is so useful in every other </v>
<v Speaker 3>context suddenly proves its utility in </v>

1011
00:55:18.630 --> 00:55:19.840
<v Speaker 3>this context where they think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1012
00:55:19.841 --> 00:55:24.841
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>clearly I know the Muslims are wrong </v>

1013
00:55:24.841 --> 00:55:24.841
<v Speaker 3>about the status of the Koran.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me,</v>

1014
00:55:24.910 --> 00:55:29.910
<v Speaker 3>let me take that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That that spirit of criticism in the </v>

1015
00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:33.721
<v Speaker 3>internal space of my own culture and </v>
<v Speaker 3>what moves well,</v>

1016
00:55:33.790 --> 00:55:38.790
<v Speaker 3>a dogmatic attachment to Christianity </v>
<v Speaker 3>has to move by that same standard and </v>

1017
00:55:38.790 --> 00:55:42.871
<v Speaker 3>that's and and it's possible to do that </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's not a matter of getting into </v>

1018
00:55:42.871 --> 00:55:43.180
<v Speaker 3>the brain and changing your perceptual </v>
<v Speaker 3>apparatus.</v>

1019
00:55:43.181 --> 00:55:43.510
<v Speaker 3>That has.</v>

1020
00:55:44.210 --> 00:55:48.880
<v Speaker 5>Well the distinction between different </v>
<v Speaker 5>levels of what would you call it,</v>

1021
00:55:49.660 --> 00:55:54.660
<v Speaker 5>structure related processing in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>brain and the relationship to the </v>

1022
00:55:54.660 --> 00:55:58.021
<v Speaker 5>underlying biology isn't clear.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it isn't clear when that's </v>

1023
00:55:58.021 --> 00:55:58.240
<v Speaker 5>biological and when is it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when it isn't.</v>

1024
00:55:58.241 --> 00:55:59.930
<v Speaker 5>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>

1025
00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:04.960
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your comments about our a priori </v>

1026
00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:07.930
<v Speaker 5>perceptual structures not withstanding,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's no clear line between what </v>

1027
00:56:07.930 --> 00:56:10.720
<v Speaker 5>constitutes and instantiated accurate </v>
<v Speaker 5>biological perception and something that</v>

1028
00:56:10.721 --> 00:56:14.560
<v Speaker 5>shades more into a cultural.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A presupposition,</v>

1029
00:56:14.710 --> 00:56:16.120
<v Speaker 5>so it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a gray area.</v>

1030
00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:17.920
<v Speaker 5>Now here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let me ask you a question.</v>

1031
00:56:17.921 --> 00:56:19.960
<v Speaker 5>So this is one of the things I've been </v>
<v Speaker 5>thinking about.</v>

1032
00:56:19.961 --> 00:56:24.961
<v Speaker 5>So this is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is designed to point out </v>

1033
00:56:24.961 --> 00:56:28.130
<v Speaker 5>difference.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not making the claim that the idea </v>

1034
00:56:28.130 --> 00:56:28.870
<v Speaker 5>that we should ground values in fact is </v>
<v Speaker 5>wrong.</v>

1035
00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:34.680
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to make that claim,</v>
<v Speaker 5>although we think it's way more </v>

1036
00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:37.111
<v Speaker 5>complicated than we've opened up so far,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I would say is I can relatively </v>

1037
00:56:37.391 --> 00:56:42.220
<v Speaker 5>easily demonstrate a situation in which </v>
<v Speaker 5>you cannot find the value from the fact.</v>

1038
00:56:42.670 --> 00:56:47.440
<v Speaker 5>Let's say you own an antique,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's valuable and you think I'm going to</v>

1039
00:56:47.441 --> 00:56:50.380
<v Speaker 5>take this antique apart and I'm going to</v>
<v Speaker 5>find out where the value is.</v>

1040
00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:56.520
<v Speaker 5>Good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not valuable in that sense where </v>

1041
00:56:56.520 --> 00:56:56.520
<v Speaker 5>I'll.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wait a sec,</v>

1042
00:56:56.520 --> 00:56:56.620
<v Speaker 5>wait a sec.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we need to know.</v>

1043
00:56:56.910 --> 00:57:01.910
<v Speaker 5>So that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not valuable in that sense because </v>

1044
00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:04.321
<v Speaker 5>the value of the antique is a social </v>
<v Speaker 5>agreement about its position in a </v>

1045
00:57:04.321 --> 00:57:07.891
<v Speaker 5>hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It has nothing to do with the material </v>

1046
00:57:07.891 --> 00:57:07.891
<v Speaker 5>substrate at the end.</v>

1047
00:57:07.891 --> 00:57:09.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not</v>

1048
00:57:11.950 --> 00:57:14.500
<v Speaker 5>claim already that you can derive value </v>
<v Speaker 5>from fat.</v>

1049
00:57:14.501 --> 00:57:15.720
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then what are you willing to.</v>

1050
00:57:16.810 --> 00:57:20.890
<v Speaker 3>These are facts about again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there are facts about the facts exist</v>

1051
00:57:20.891 --> 00:57:22.750
<v Speaker 3>in intersubjective space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1052
00:57:22.751 --> 00:57:24.100
<v Speaker 3>So if I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I tell you,</v>

1053
00:57:24.130 --> 00:57:24.910
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this glass,</v>

1054
00:57:24.911 --> 00:57:27.370
<v Speaker 3>this isn't just an ordinary glass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know it looks just like that one,</v>

1055
00:57:27.371 --> 00:57:32.371
<v Speaker 3>but this is the glass that Elton John </v>
<v Speaker 3>Drank from his last concert here.</v>

1056
00:57:33.430 --> 00:57:36.280
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what do you want to pay me for it?</v>

1057
00:57:36.510 --> 00:57:38.440
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could be that,</v>

1058
00:57:38.441 --> 00:57:43.441
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just the biggest Elton John Fan </v>

1059
00:57:43.441 --> 00:57:43.441
<v Speaker 3>ever and it's worth quite a lot to you </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

1060
00:57:43.441 --> 00:57:48.421
<v Speaker 3>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a kind of evidence is not value </v>

1061
00:57:48.421 --> 00:57:49.360
<v Speaker 3>intrinsic to the glass,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it is,</v>

1062
00:57:49.420 --> 00:57:51.070
<v Speaker 3>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is a.</v>

1063
00:57:51.130 --> 00:57:52.480
<v Speaker 3>where's the value located?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was,</v>

1064
00:57:52.540 --> 00:57:57.160
<v Speaker 3>is a measure in the change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This provokes in your experience,</v>

1065
00:57:57.161 --> 00:57:57.930
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's the idea.</v>

1066
00:57:57.931 --> 00:58:00.710
<v Speaker 3>I mean we value ideas as much as </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything else and that's,</v>

1067
00:58:00.970 --> 00:58:04.300
<v Speaker 3>that's hence the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mad work done by religion,</v>

1068
00:58:04.350 --> 00:58:05.740
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean because it's not.</v>

1069
00:58:05.910 --> 00:58:10.910
<v Speaker 3>These aren't facts on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are ideas that rural people's </v>

1070
00:58:10.910 --> 00:58:12.250
<v Speaker 3>lives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People spend their whole life afraid of.</v>

1071
00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:12.520
<v Speaker 3>Hell,</v>

1072
00:58:12.570 --> 00:58:17.570
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It seems to meet that it's easier in </v>

1073
00:58:17.570 --> 00:58:18.570
<v Speaker 5>some sense rather than to relate the </v>
<v Speaker 5>value of that,</v>

1074
00:58:18.610 --> 00:58:22.620
<v Speaker 5>and I love the Elton John's class </v>
<v Speaker 5>example to use Elvis Presley is here.</v>

1075
00:58:22.621 --> 00:58:23.630
<v Speaker 5>I will.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I will tell you,</v>

1076
00:58:23.870 --> 00:58:28.870
<v Speaker 5>it's like where in the guitar is the </v>
<v Speaker 5>fact that it's Elvis Presley's and </v>

1077
00:58:28.870 --> 00:58:29.340
<v Speaker 5>guitar,</v>
<v Speaker 5>while it's nowhere in the guitar.</v>

1078
00:58:29.370 --> 00:58:30.450
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is it in?</v>

1079
00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:35.480
<v Speaker 5>Where is it that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the answer is it's in the dominance </v>

1080
00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:37.620
<v Speaker 5>hierarchy values that's been socially </v>
<v Speaker 5>constructed around the guitar.</v>

1081
00:58:37.770 --> 00:58:41.730
<v Speaker 5>It's located at an interpersonal space </v>
<v Speaker 5>and that that location,</v>

1082
00:58:41.731 --> 00:58:45.090
<v Speaker 5>so value is located in interpersonal </v>
<v Speaker 5>space and if you want to say,</v>

1083
00:58:45.091 --> 00:58:46.410
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's also a fact.</v>

1084
00:58:46.411 --> 00:58:47.040
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1085
00:58:47.041 --> 00:58:47.310
<v Speaker 5>but</v>

1086
00:58:47.430 --> 00:58:52.430
<v Speaker 3>we're starting to stretch the beliefs </v>
<v Speaker 3>and desires and conscious dates of all </v>

1087
00:58:52.711 --> 00:58:56.220
<v Speaker 3>the people involved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the only place where it exists.</v>

1088
00:58:56.221 --> 00:58:59.350
<v Speaker 3>That's the only fair enough with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea of Elvis' guitar can show up.</v>

1089
00:58:59.460 --> 00:59:01.470
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to figure out then you see,</v>

1090
00:59:01.471 --> 00:59:06.471
<v Speaker 5>because what seems to me to be happening</v>
<v Speaker 5>at least in part is that we can stretch </v>

1091
00:59:06.471 --> 00:59:10.941
<v Speaker 5>the the domain of what constitutes of </v>
<v Speaker 5>facts so that the domain of fact starts </v>

1092
00:59:10.941 --> 00:59:15.711
<v Speaker 5>to incorporate the domain of values,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we do that with some doing some </v>

1093
00:59:15.711 --> 00:59:16.770
<v Speaker 5>damage to the domain of fact.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1094
00:59:16.780 --> 00:59:17.260
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1095
00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:17.940
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hang on.</v>

1096
00:59:17.941 --> 00:59:18.500
<v Speaker 5>Don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't say,</v>

1097
00:59:18.540 --> 00:59:21.440
<v Speaker 5>don't just say no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll more.</v>

1098
00:59:21.740 --> 00:59:24.290
<v Speaker 5>This is really complicated because you </v>
<v Speaker 5>see,</v>

1099
00:59:24.350 --> 00:59:29.350
<v Speaker 5>part of what the postmodernists have </v>
<v Speaker 5>done is they've pushed away the domain </v>

1100
00:59:29.350 --> 00:59:29.960
<v Speaker 5>of facts entirely and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1101
00:59:29.990 --> 00:59:33.860
<v Speaker 5>the only thing is is that the only thing</v>
<v Speaker 5>that actually exists is that this domain</v>

1102
00:59:33.861 --> 00:59:36.100
<v Speaker 5>of intersubjective agreement and</v>

1103
00:59:36.790 --> 00:59:37.220
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1104
00:59:37.460 --> 00:59:39.800
<v Speaker 3>you and I are on the same page with </v>
<v Speaker 3>respect to postmodern.</v>

1105
00:59:39.900 --> 00:59:40.370
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

1106
00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:41.550
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you have to give,</v>

1107
00:59:41.551 --> 00:59:46.551
<v Speaker 5>but you have to give them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to give the devil his due as </v>

1108
00:59:46.551 --> 00:59:49.281
<v Speaker 5>well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're pointed out something and what </v>

1109
00:59:49.281 --> 00:59:51.920
<v Speaker 5>they pointed out is that it's not so </v>
<v Speaker 5>easy to localize the structure that </v>

1110
00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:55.790
<v Speaker 5>attributes to fax their value.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not a simple thing that we were </v>

1111
00:59:55.790 --> 00:59:55.790
<v Speaker 5>way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1112
00:59:56.580 --> 01:00:01.110
<v Speaker 5>You would surely agree that if we had </v>
<v Speaker 5>Elvis Presley's guitar,</v>

1113
01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:05.520
<v Speaker 5>that that guitar would have a material </v>
<v Speaker 5>impact on people.</v>

1114
01:00:05.550 --> 01:00:08.040
<v Speaker 5>We could tell them this is Elvis </v>
<v Speaker 5>Presley's guitar.</v>

1115
01:00:08.041 --> 01:00:09.670
<v Speaker 5>Some fraction of them would disbelieve </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

1116
01:00:09.810 --> 01:00:14.810
<v Speaker 5>Somebody might be able to establish it </v>
<v Speaker 5>based on a picture or something like </v>

1117
01:00:14.810 --> 01:00:17.991
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the point is it would have a value </v>

1118
01:00:17.991 --> 01:00:21.260
<v Speaker 5>that would alter the behavior of people </v>
<v Speaker 5>with respect to that object in a </v>

1119
01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:22.440
<v Speaker 5>material way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

1120
01:00:22.441 --> 01:00:26.700
<v Speaker 5>it would alter the behavior of the p </v>
<v Speaker 5>values manifest in physical space.</v>

1121
01:00:27.270 --> 01:00:28.810
<v Speaker 5>Which part of it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The detective.</v>

1122
01:00:28.950 --> 01:00:33.950
<v Speaker 5>We could figure out what the value of </v>
<v Speaker 5>this guitar is based on some </v>

1123
01:00:33.950 --> 01:00:33.950
<v Speaker 5>intersection.</v>

1124
01:00:33.950 --> 01:00:37.670
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can take a behaviorist approach and </v>

1125
01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:37.670
<v Speaker 3>we could see how much work people were </v>
<v Speaker 3>willing to do to contact.</v>

1126
01:00:38.090 --> 01:00:42.220
<v Speaker 3>We can scan their brains and see what we</v>
<v Speaker 3>can do that well.</v>

1127
01:00:42.250 --> 01:00:43.800
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>clearly I ran it evolved.</v>

1128
01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:45.250
<v Speaker 3>Hypothetically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can do it,</v>

1129
01:00:45.251 --> 01:00:48.580
<v Speaker 3>but practically we're not so good </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the MRI data,</v>

1130
01:00:48.581 --> 01:00:50.100
<v Speaker 3>generally speaking is junk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1131
01:00:50.101 --> 01:00:55.101
<v Speaker 3>the way we can table that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's controversial statement in Mri </v>

1132
01:00:56.300 --> 01:00:58.720
<v Speaker 3>circles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fair enough.</v>

1133
01:00:58.750 --> 01:01:00.430
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we need it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need it,</v>

1134
01:01:00.431 --> 01:01:03.410
<v Speaker 3>but we go with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A market will establish the brain.</v>

1135
01:01:03.470 --> 01:01:08.470
<v Speaker 3>The brain as yet incompletely understood</v>
<v Speaker 3>is surely involved in the value of this </v>

1136
01:01:08.470 --> 01:01:08.860
<v Speaker 3>object.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1137
01:01:08.861 --> 01:01:11.140
<v Speaker 3>And so if I take,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I tell you that this is,</v>

1138
01:01:11.170 --> 01:01:16.170
<v Speaker 3>and again we can take it out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>intersubjective space because it </v>

1139
01:01:16.170 --> 01:01:18.601
<v Speaker 3>couldn't you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could be in a value solitude with </v>

1140
01:01:18.601 --> 01:01:18.910
<v Speaker 3>respect to any given object,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it could just be,</v>

1141
01:01:19.150 --> 01:01:24.150
<v Speaker 3>you could have a sentimental attachment </v>
<v Speaker 3>to your watch that's worth exactly $25 </v>

1142
01:01:25.001 --> 01:01:27.990
<v Speaker 3>because that's what you paid for it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is the watch that you know,</v>

1143
01:01:28.090 --> 01:01:33.090
<v Speaker 3>this is your first watch or whatever it </v>
<v Speaker 3>is and you wouldn't sell it for any </v>

1144
01:01:33.090 --> 01:01:33.090
<v Speaker 3>amount of money.</v>

1145
01:01:33.090 --> 01:01:34.630
<v Speaker 3>That's a measure of your but behavioral </v>
<v Speaker 3>measure of how much you value it.</v>

1146
01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:36.150
<v Speaker 3>And if I told you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh well,</v>

1147
01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:36.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>

1148
01:01:36.791 --> 01:01:41.791
<v Speaker 3>I brought your watch and lost it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the cascade of negative effects </v>

1149
01:01:41.791 --> 01:01:46.251
<v Speaker 3>that I see on your face as correlated </v>
<v Speaker 3>with something that's happening in your </v>

1150
01:01:46.251 --> 01:01:46.251
<v Speaker 3>head and the brain is involved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1151
01:01:46.251 --> 01:01:49.980
<v Speaker 3>So that the quality of that picture </v>
<v Speaker 3>basically state is devalued.</v>

1152
01:01:50.350 --> 01:01:55.350
<v Speaker 5>Tell us that there'd be a socio cultural</v>
<v Speaker 5>agreement as to the value of whatever </v>

1153
01:01:55.350 --> 01:01:59.881
<v Speaker 5>this entity is and that would find it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>mirroring the brain and that's a </v>

1154
01:01:59.881 --> 01:02:00.210
<v Speaker 5>noncontroversial stated,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ecos,</v>

1155
01:02:00.260 --> 01:02:05.260
<v Speaker 5>all socio cultural phenomena that are </v>
<v Speaker 5>experienced find a reflection of the </v>

1156
01:02:05.260 --> 01:02:09.091
<v Speaker 5>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The fact that you can say that that's </v>

1157
01:02:09.091 --> 01:02:09.091
<v Speaker 5>reflected in the brain.</v>

1158
01:02:09.091 --> 01:02:12.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Continually run into with religion is </v>

1159
01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:16.661
<v Speaker 3>that there you have a domain of so </v>
<v Speaker 3>called sacred values where people who </v>

1160
01:02:16.661 --> 01:02:19.310
<v Speaker 3>are otherwise rational ceased to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>rational actors,</v>

1161
01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:24.320
<v Speaker 3>so the reason why Israel and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Israelis and the Palestinians can't </v>

1162
01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:29.121
<v Speaker 3>negotiate as though their problems could</v>
<v Speaker 3>be solved by a real estate transaction </v>

1163
01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:35.240
<v Speaker 3>is because they have irrational and </v>
<v Speaker 3>irreconcilable claims upon land and </v>

1164
01:02:35.791 --> 01:02:40.791
<v Speaker 3>building.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think there are any more </v>

1165
01:02:40.791 --> 01:02:43.341
<v Speaker 3>irrational than the claim that that </v>
<v Speaker 3>class is worth something when no one </v>

1166
01:02:43.341 --> 01:02:47.460
<v Speaker 3>knows that it's like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not irrational by your own </v>

1167
01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:52.131
<v Speaker 3>definition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just said that that was actually </v>

1168
01:02:52.131 --> 01:02:52.470
<v Speaker 3>constituted a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a fact about people,</v>

1169
01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:55.460
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is okay.</v>

1170
01:02:56.130 --> 01:02:58.260
<v Speaker 3>Just be a little careful here because it</v>
<v Speaker 3>gets confusing.</v>

1171
01:02:58.710 --> 01:03:03.710
<v Speaker 3>The there are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can make objective claims about </v>

1172
01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:07.200
<v Speaker 3>subjective experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1173
01:03:07.201 --> 01:03:08.910
<v Speaker 3>It's not as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's there are,</v>

1174
01:03:09.570 --> 01:03:11.730
<v Speaker 3>we use this word objective and </v>
<v Speaker 3>subjective in,</v>

1175
01:03:11.731 --> 01:03:12.630
<v Speaker 3>in different ways.</v>

1176
01:03:12.630 --> 01:03:15.630
<v Speaker 3>We use it in an epistemological ways and</v>
<v Speaker 3>ontological ways,</v>

1177
01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:19.470
<v Speaker 3>and give me just one sec to make sure </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm on the same,</v>

1178
01:03:20.030 --> 01:03:20.980
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by.</v>

1179
01:03:21.070 --> 01:03:22.890
<v Speaker 3>I can illustrate it by way of example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I say no,</v>

1180
01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:25.470
<v Speaker 3>that's just your subjective opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1181
01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:28.890
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying I'm denigrating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying that this is an expression of</v>

1182
01:03:28.891 --> 01:03:30.220
<v Speaker 3>your bias.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is this,</v>

1183
01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:32.880
<v Speaker 3>this is true for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not true out in the world,</v>

1184
01:03:32.881 --> 01:03:35.110
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one way I can use the,</v>

1185
01:03:35.490 --> 01:03:39.780
<v Speaker 3>the subjective objective distinction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's an epistomological way.</v>

1186
01:03:39.781 --> 01:03:40.410
<v Speaker 3>Like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1187
01:03:40.411 --> 01:03:42.660
<v Speaker 3>you're ruled by bias.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not thinking straight.</v>

1188
01:03:42.690 --> 01:03:47.690
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have to take your opinion </v>

1189
01:03:47.690 --> 01:03:47.690
<v Speaker 3>seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's subjective.</v>

1190
01:03:47.690 --> 01:03:48.690
<v Speaker 3>I'm worried about objective facts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people get confused.</v>

1191
01:03:48.691 --> 01:03:52.620
<v Speaker 3>They think that objective facts only </v>
<v Speaker 3>means the material world.</v>

1192
01:03:52.890 --> 01:03:57.890
<v Speaker 3>And what's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's really in this glass as a </v>

1193
01:03:57.890 --> 01:03:57.890
<v Speaker 3>material object.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1194
01:03:57.890 --> 01:03:59.160
<v Speaker 3>we can be much more objective than that.</v>

1195
01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:04.160
<v Speaker 3>We can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can make objective claims about the </v>

1196
01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:05.580
<v Speaker 3>subjective experience of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of people like ourselves.</v>

1197
01:04:05.581 --> 01:04:06.390
<v Speaker 3>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can,</v>

1198
01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:12.140
<v Speaker 3>I can make an infinite number of </v>
<v Speaker 3>objective claims about the experience </v>

1199
01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:13.380
<v Speaker 3>of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the example I always use,</v>

1200
01:04:13.381 --> 01:04:15.780
<v Speaker 3>but I just happen to love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

1201
01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:19.990
<v Speaker 3>what was jfk thinking the moment he got </v>
<v Speaker 3>shot right there.</v>

1202
01:04:19.991 --> 01:04:24.991
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't know that we'll never get the </v>

1203
01:04:24.991 --> 01:04:24.991
<v Speaker 3>data right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>

1204
01:04:24.991 --> 01:04:25.230
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the truth or falseness of,</v>

1205
01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:29.160
<v Speaker 3>of what I'm about to say can't be </v>
<v Speaker 3>predicated on actually getting access to</v>

1206
01:04:29.161 --> 01:04:32.970
<v Speaker 3>the data because because he's not around</v>
<v Speaker 3>and his brain's not around to scan.</v>

1207
01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:35.490
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

1208
01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:40.750
<v Speaker 3>but we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you and I both know an infinite number </v>

1209
01:04:40.750 --> 01:04:43.380
<v Speaker 3>of things he wasn't thinking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can make an objective claim about his</v>

1210
01:04:43.381 --> 01:04:46.020
<v Speaker 3>subjectivity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know he wasn't thinking,</v>

1211
01:04:46.230 --> 01:04:51.230
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope Jordan Peterson has Sam Harris' </v>

1212
01:04:51.230 --> 01:04:53.361
<v Speaker 3>work it out on stage that night and an </v>
<v Speaker 3>infinite number of things like that.</v>

1213
01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:58.520
<v Speaker 3>He was thinking something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was experiencing something but we </v>

1214
01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:01.530
<v Speaker 3>don't know what it is that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I saw what I'm talking about.</v>

1215
01:05:01.531 --> 01:05:06.531
<v Speaker 3>This domain of value.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying that it exists in the this </v>

1216
01:05:07.050 --> 01:05:12.050
<v Speaker 3>landscape of actual impossible conscious</v>
<v Speaker 3>experience for human beings and any </v>

1217
01:05:12.571 --> 01:05:17.571
<v Speaker 3>other system like us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can experience this range of </v>

1218
01:05:17.571 --> 01:05:17.571
<v Speaker 3>suffering and happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well.</v>

1219
01:05:17.571 --> 01:05:18.040
<v Speaker 3>So partly</v>

1220
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:21.220
<v Speaker 5>what I'm trying to do is to actually </v>
<v Speaker 5>determine what that structure is.</v>

1221
01:05:21.810 --> 01:05:26.810
<v Speaker 3>So in our case it's certainly connected </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the evolved structure of our brain by</v>

1222
01:05:29.210 --> 01:05:29.690
<v Speaker 3>everything else.</v>

1223
01:05:29.870 --> 01:05:34.870
<v Speaker 5>They want to go way deeper into to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>idea then it's connected with brain </v>

1224
01:05:34.870 --> 01:05:34.870
<v Speaker 5>states because it's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

1225
01:05:34.870 --> 01:05:36.590
<v Speaker 5>it's definitely connected with brain </v>
<v Speaker 5>states.</v>

1226
01:05:36.591 --> 01:05:39.800
<v Speaker 5>The question is at least in part how and</v>
<v Speaker 5>what does that mean?</v>

1227
01:05:39.860 --> 01:05:44.860
<v Speaker 5>And I think that the neuroscience has </v>
<v Speaker 5>progressed far enough so that we can do </v>

1228
01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:48.071
<v Speaker 5>quite a good job of this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so what I want to return to one </v>

1229
01:05:48.071 --> 01:05:51.371
<v Speaker 5>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and maybe I'll outline a little bit of </v>

1230
01:05:51.371 --> 01:05:52.700
<v Speaker 5>this and when you talked about the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Israeli Palestinian conflict,</v>

1231
01:05:52.701 --> 01:05:55.490
<v Speaker 5>you said that that was irrational.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so look,</v>

1232
01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:56.420
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fair enough,</v>

1233
01:05:56.700 --> 01:06:00.080
<v Speaker 5>people have been locked with their hands</v>
<v Speaker 5>around each other's necks there for 3000</v>

1234
01:06:00.081 --> 01:06:05.081
<v Speaker 5>years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But there's a problem there and the </v>

1235
01:06:05.081 --> 01:06:07.631
<v Speaker 5>problem is that people are looking at </v>
<v Speaker 5>the landscape from a contextualized </v>

1236
01:06:09.110 --> 01:06:10.520
<v Speaker 5>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1237
01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:13.460
<v Speaker 5>It's not just a piece of land,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's their piece of land.</v>

1238
01:06:13.461 --> 01:06:15.590
<v Speaker 5>It's like your house or your favorite </v>
<v Speaker 5>shirt.</v>

1239
01:06:15.591 --> 01:06:16.070
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

1240
01:06:16.071 --> 01:06:16.490
<v Speaker 5>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1241
01:06:16.491 --> 01:06:18.050
<v Speaker 5>I have a favorite shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

1242
01:06:18.051 --> 01:06:23.051
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's nothing inherent in the shirt </v>

1243
01:06:23.051 --> 01:06:23.051
<v Speaker 5>that makes it your favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1244
01:06:23.051 --> 01:06:23.051
<v Speaker 5>it's a subjective judgment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

1245
01:06:23.051 --> 01:06:23.930
<v Speaker 5>well then is that a fact?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1246
01:06:23.931 --> 01:06:24.740
<v Speaker 5>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a fact.</v>

1247
01:06:24.741 --> 01:06:26.870
<v Speaker 5>It's a fact about subjective judgment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's okay.</v>

1248
01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:32.080
<v Speaker 5>While the Israeli claim on the land and </v>
<v Speaker 5>the Palestinian claim on the land is a </v>

1249
01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:32.080
<v Speaker 5>subjective judgment that</v>

1250
01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:34.310
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so how is it saving it?</v>

1251
01:06:34.340 --> 01:06:39.110
<v Speaker 3>Because it is the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The true analogy here.</v>

1252
01:06:39.111 --> 01:06:44.111
<v Speaker 3>The complete analogy is rather like </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're about to fight over Elton John's </v>

1253
01:06:46.130 --> 01:06:49.220
<v Speaker 3>glass and Elton John was never here.</v>

1254
01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:50.470
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1255
01:06:58.060 --> 01:07:01.230
<v Speaker 3>Not saying it clearly still matters to </v>
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>

1256
01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:05.520
<v Speaker 3>In our misapprehension of our situation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we still really care.</v>

1257
01:07:05.550 --> 01:07:10.550
<v Speaker 3>And these are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are objectively true claims about </v>

1258
01:07:10.550 --> 01:07:12.300
<v Speaker 3>the level at which we value things and </v>
<v Speaker 3>hence the impasse.</v>

1259
01:07:12.590 --> 01:07:16.140
<v Speaker 3>But it matters if it's counter </v>
<v Speaker 3>productively dismissive,</v>

1260
01:07:16.170 --> 01:07:17.310
<v Speaker 3>like you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1261
01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:21.090
<v Speaker 3>when you look at this specific claim,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's really not.</v>

1262
01:07:21.930 --> 01:07:26.930
<v Speaker 5>Look you took,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you took the contextual interpretation </v>

1263
01:07:26.930 --> 01:07:26.930
<v Speaker 5>to its absolute extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You said,</v>

1264
01:07:26.930 --> 01:07:31.281
<v Speaker 5>well there's multiple reasons why </v>
<v Speaker 5>different people who occupied the same </v>

1265
01:07:31.281 --> 01:07:32.280
<v Speaker 5>piece of land are going to feel about it</v>
<v Speaker 5>in different ways.</v>

1266
01:07:32.310 --> 01:07:33.060
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1267
01:07:33.310 --> 01:07:38.310
<v Speaker 3>And those reasons are amenable to some </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of rational compromise actually </v>

1268
01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:44.520
<v Speaker 3>studies on this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's studies done by people </v>

1269
01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:44.520
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you say this rewrap it,</v>

1270
01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:45.390
<v Speaker 5>you say the word rational in that </v>
<v Speaker 5>context,</v>

1271
01:07:45.391 --> 01:07:50.391
<v Speaker 5>you're using it as a black box that </v>
<v Speaker 5>contains the concept proper way of </v>

1272
01:07:50.391 --> 01:07:54.291
<v Speaker 5>thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like it's not so obvious in most </v>

1273
01:07:54.291 --> 01:07:54.291
<v Speaker 5>situations what the rational approach </v>
<v Speaker 5>is.</v>

1274
01:07:54.330 --> 01:07:59.330
<v Speaker 3>I always have an obvious one here and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's that whatever the Christians and </v>

1275
01:08:00.891 --> 01:08:05.891
<v Speaker 3>the Muslims and the Jews think they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting from their attachment to their </v>

1276
01:08:05.891 --> 01:08:10.121
<v Speaker 3>dogmatic and irreconcilable and </v>
<v Speaker 3>religious worldviews can be gotten just </v>

1277
01:08:10.290 --> 01:08:15.010
<v Speaker 3>as well by a deeper understanding of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1278
01:08:15.050 --> 01:08:20.050
<v Speaker 3>of our universal and non culturally </v>
<v Speaker 3>bound capacity for ethical experience,</v>

1279
01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:24.290
<v Speaker 3>spiritual experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>community building.</v>

1280
01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:26.620
<v Speaker 3>And we can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's that?</v>

1281
01:08:27.530 --> 01:08:31.380
<v Speaker 3>We can touch that specs without.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like the status quo is,</v>

1282
01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:34.730
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like your content to live in</v>
<v Speaker 3>a world or your at least your content,</v>

1283
01:08:34.731 --> 01:08:39.731
<v Speaker 3>not to judge too harshly a world where </v>
<v Speaker 3>fans of rival soccer teams or baseball </v>

1284
01:08:41.061 --> 01:08:44.870
<v Speaker 3>teams regularly kill one another over </v>
<v Speaker 3>their fandom.</v>

1285
01:08:45.140 --> 01:08:45.400
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1286
01:08:45.401 --> 01:08:47.120
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what if that were the status quo?</v>

1287
01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:48.710
<v Speaker 3>So He's been this way for thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

1288
01:08:48.711 --> 01:08:51.230
<v Speaker 3>There must be a reason for it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I really like sports.</v>

1289
01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:54.380
<v Speaker 3>I'm not trying to justify the Israeli </v>
<v Speaker 3>Palestinian conflict.</v>

1290
01:08:54.700 --> 01:08:59.700
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm saying that too quick to judge </v>

1291
01:08:59.700 --> 01:08:59.700
<v Speaker 3>the sanctity of their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of their differences of opinion.</v>

1292
01:08:59.700 --> 01:08:59.780
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1293
01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:01.060
<v Speaker 5>but wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sam,</v>

1294
01:09:01.061 --> 01:09:06.061
<v Speaker 5>there you made a claim.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your claim was that if the Christians </v>

1295
01:09:06.061 --> 01:09:09.661
<v Speaker 5>and the Jews and the Muslims would just </v>
<v Speaker 5>stop their stupidity and adopt this </v>

1296
01:09:09.661 --> 01:09:10.330
<v Speaker 5>universal ethic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then everything would be okay.</v>

1297
01:09:10.331 --> 01:09:11.200
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1298
01:09:11.230 --> 01:09:14.440
<v Speaker 5>what's the basis for the universal ethic</v>
<v Speaker 5>like that sets.</v>

1299
01:09:14.660 --> 01:09:19.660
<v Speaker 3>That's the truth isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's an interesting problem for </v>

1300
01:09:20.801 --> 01:09:25.801
<v Speaker 3>philosophers and for scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not actually where the rubber </v>

1301
01:09:25.841 --> 01:09:28.380
<v Speaker 3>meets the road for people living their </v>
<v Speaker 3>lives.</v>

1302
01:09:28.390 --> 01:09:28.840
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1303
01:09:28.970 --> 01:09:33.970
<v Speaker 3>is this analogous to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the difference between the band?</v>

1304
01:09:34.930 --> 01:09:38.560
<v Speaker 3>I really care about all of this and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>and my job as a,</v>

1305
01:09:38.620 --> 01:09:43.620
<v Speaker 3>as a philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a moral philosopher in that case is </v>

1306
01:09:43.620 --> 01:09:44.470
<v Speaker 3>to make the best case I can for these </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas,</v>

1307
01:09:44.471 --> 01:09:49.471
<v Speaker 3>but the truth is it is analogous to when</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you get into a debate with a </v>

1308
01:09:49.471 --> 01:09:54.270
<v Speaker 3>Christian fundamentalists in the states,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very often this per this person will </v>

1309
01:09:54.551 --> 01:09:59.551
<v Speaker 3>pretend to care about cosmology as or </v>
<v Speaker 3>evolution as though it's the most </v>

1310
01:10:00.521 --> 01:10:05.521
<v Speaker 3>important thing in the world as though </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't get out of bed in the morning </v>

1311
01:10:05.521 --> 01:10:08.191
<v Speaker 3>and figure out how to treat your friends</v>
<v Speaker 3>and family well unless you figure out </v>

1312
01:10:08.191 --> 01:10:08.740
<v Speaker 3>what happened before the Big Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1313
01:10:08.741 --> 01:10:13.741
<v Speaker 3>No one really lives their lives that way</v>
<v Speaker 3>and yet we have convinced ourselves that</v>

1314
01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:19.500
<v Speaker 3>this is a sensible way of talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>the conflict between religion and </v>

1315
01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:19.500
<v Speaker 3>science.</v>

1316
01:10:20.490 --> 01:10:23.940
<v Speaker 1>I think you have arrived at the core of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your conflict right here,</v>

1317
01:10:23.970 --> 01:10:26.070
<v Speaker 1>and I actually hear you both loud and </v>
<v Speaker 1>clear.</v>

1318
01:10:27.420 --> 01:10:32.420
<v Speaker 1>Your point is that if the people faced </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the question where to start with a </v>

1319
01:10:33.601 --> 01:10:35.580
<v Speaker 1>fresh sheet of paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the Middle East,</v>

1320
01:10:35.581 --> 01:10:40.581
<v Speaker 1>they could arrive at a compromise that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they as individuals might find a put </v>

1321
01:10:41.461 --> 01:10:46.461
<v Speaker 1>them way ahead and is more profitable </v>
<v Speaker 1>than the situation that they are </v>

1322
01:10:46.461 --> 01:10:48.360
<v Speaker 1>continually finding themselves and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>might be the case.</v>

1323
01:10:48.420 --> 01:10:53.420
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason that they don't is that </v>

1324
01:10:53.420 --> 01:10:57.270
<v Speaker 1>historically those who have have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>out competed by those who haven't,</v>

1325
01:10:57.660 --> 01:11:02.660
<v Speaker 1>so the point is the universe and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that it refuses to solve that </v>

1326
01:11:02.660 --> 01:11:07.221
<v Speaker 1>conflict is telling us that there is </v>
<v Speaker 1>some reason that people who take that </v>

1327
01:11:07.221 --> 01:11:11.571
<v Speaker 1>prospect seriously are not actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>correct in some at least metaphorical.</v>

1328
01:11:13.350 --> 01:11:18.350
<v Speaker 1>So in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it to have a sentimental </v>

1329
01:11:18.350 --> 01:11:21.081
<v Speaker 1>attachment to some piece of territory </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere that sounds completely </v>

1330
01:11:21.081 --> 01:11:22.230
<v Speaker 1>irrational.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>

1331
01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:27.320
<v Speaker 1>that sentimental attachment may result </v>
<v Speaker 1>in you continuing for 500 or a thousand </v>

1332
01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:30.150
<v Speaker 1>or 2000 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if you surrendered it because it</v>

1333
01:11:30.151 --> 01:11:32.040
<v Speaker 1>was irrational,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might go extinct.</v>

1334
01:11:32.070 --> 01:11:37.070
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should you care that your lineage is </v>

1335
01:11:37.070 --> 01:11:37.070
<v Speaker 1>going to go extinct?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe,</v>

1336
01:11:37.070 --> 01:11:37.380
<v Speaker 1>arguably not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>

1337
01:11:37.530 --> 01:11:41.760
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to imagine that what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying is so thoroughly grounded that it</v>

1338
01:11:41.761 --> 01:11:46.761
<v Speaker 1>can justify causing people to alter </v>
<v Speaker 1>their perspective on value in such a way</v>

1339
01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:49.080
<v Speaker 1>that it might actually drive them </v>
<v Speaker 1>extinct.</v>

1340
01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:50.090
<v Speaker 1>It's not clear that that's good.</v>

1341
01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:55.120
<v Speaker 3>Clearly secularism made.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were talking about the fringe here.</v>

1342
01:11:55.660 --> 01:11:58.390
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about that when you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about this case,</v>

1343
01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:03.520
<v Speaker 3>the Israeli settlers and the Palestinian</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrorists,</v>

1344
01:12:03.870 --> 01:12:05.860
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that is that is it.</v>

1345
01:12:06.130 --> 01:12:09.490
<v Speaker 3>We should all breathe a sigh of relief </v>
<v Speaker 3>that that doesn't,</v>

1346
01:12:09.491 --> 01:12:09.840
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1347
01:12:09.841 --> 01:12:14.841
<v Speaker 3>that kind of passion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that attachment to land doesn't </v>

1348
01:12:14.841 --> 01:12:17.620
<v Speaker 3>characterize most of humanity if you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to defend your house.</v>

1349
01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:18.310
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1350
01:12:18.490 --> 01:12:18.910
<v Speaker 3>but that's.</v>

1351
01:12:20.750 --> 01:12:23.790
<v Speaker 1>Can I kind of different topic on Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think this is.</v>

1352
01:12:23.791 --> 01:12:26.370
<v Speaker 1>This is where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is where the crux of it is.</v>

1353
01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:32.120
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we follow the idea that this is </v>

1354
01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:34.971
<v Speaker 1>actually some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the seemingly sentimental and </v>

1355
01:12:34.971 --> 01:12:37.380
<v Speaker 1>irrational attachment to the piece of </v>
<v Speaker 1>land is some sort of Meta rationality,</v>

1356
01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:42.500
<v Speaker 1>which sounds like your perspective than </v>
<v Speaker 1>we are now confronted with the question </v>

1357
01:12:43.110 --> 01:12:44.100
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

1358
01:12:44.101 --> 01:12:49.101
<v Speaker 1>if it is an evolved kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rationality that is being manifest in </v>

1359
01:12:49.101 --> 01:12:53.151
<v Speaker 1>stories that cause people to behave in </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways that Sam sees as clearly </v>

1360
01:12:53.151 --> 01:12:56.660
<v Speaker 1>irrational,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we are stuck with the naturalistic </v>

1361
01:12:56.660 --> 01:12:59.691
<v Speaker 1>fallacy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to say so for those who don't </v>

1362
01:12:59.691 --> 01:13:02.421
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the naturalistic fallacy says that just </v>

1363
01:13:02.421 --> 01:13:02.450
<v Speaker 1>because something is doesn't mean it </v>
<v Speaker 1>ought,</v>

1364
01:13:02.490 --> 01:13:05.220
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that selection favors something</v>

1365
01:13:05.221 --> 01:13:09.510
<v Speaker 1>doesn't make it good and the aztecs </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrificed their enemies.</v>

1366
01:13:09.660 --> 01:13:14.660
<v Speaker 1>It is good for continuing as Technis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it may not be good in some absolute </v>

1367
01:13:14.660 --> 01:13:15.570
<v Speaker 1>moral sense.</v>

1368
01:13:15.780 --> 01:13:20.780
<v Speaker 1>So here's the question for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're arguing for an I think an </v>

1369
01:13:20.780 --> 01:13:25.440
<v Speaker 1>evolutionarily very viable explanation </v>
<v Speaker 1>for religious belief and dogma,</v>

1370
01:13:25.441 --> 01:13:27.570
<v Speaker 1>but aren't you stuck with the downside </v>
<v Speaker 1>of it?</v>

1371
01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:32.520
<v Speaker 1>Where much of what is encoded in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>way may actually be abhorrent,</v>

1372
01:13:32.630 --> 01:13:34.260
<v Speaker 1>morally unconscious?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

1373
01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:35.790
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what are you doing about it?</v>

1374
01:13:35.820 --> 01:13:39.840
<v Speaker 1>What do we do about what this is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is exactly how a sorting algorithm.</v>

1375
01:13:39.870 --> 01:13:41.270
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

1376
01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:42.530
<v Speaker 1>Trying to get to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1377
01:13:42.810 --> 01:13:44.910
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is actually why I asked Sam this</v>

1378
01:13:44.911 --> 01:13:45.660
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't.</v>

1379
01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:47.130
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't an attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1380
01:13:47.490 --> 01:13:49.290
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so look,</v>

1381
01:13:49.380 --> 01:13:51.540
<v Speaker 1>people have these belief systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christian Muslim,</v>

1382
01:13:51.541 --> 01:13:54.600
<v Speaker 1>Jew will say for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're saying abandoned analysts,</v>

1383
01:13:54.810 --> 01:13:58.500
<v Speaker 1>let's say two to and move towards this </v>
<v Speaker 1>transcendent rationality.</v>

1384
01:13:58.880 --> 01:13:59.490
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1385
01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:04.940
<v Speaker 1>two problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not so easy to abandon the belief </v>

1386
01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:07.920
<v Speaker 1>system because you ended up in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>morally relativist nihilist pit problem.</v>

1387
01:14:08.180 --> 01:14:11.560
<v Speaker 1>One doesn't have to tend to and so</v>

1388
01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:18.520
<v Speaker 5>they don't have to claim that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We would be.</v>

1389
01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:20.350
<v Speaker 5>We'd have to find out whether that is </v>
<v Speaker 5>true.</v>

1390
01:14:20.430 --> 01:14:22.970
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of evidence against that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1391
01:14:23.020 --> 01:14:25.960
<v Speaker 5>there's plenty of evidence for it too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's beside the point to some degree</v>

1392
01:14:25.961 --> 01:14:30.961
<v Speaker 5>because that isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That isn't something that I want to </v>

1393
01:14:30.961 --> 01:14:30.961
<v Speaker 5>quibble about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The perhaps there are trends.</v>

1394
01:14:30.961 --> 01:14:35.250
<v Speaker 5>There are transitional paths and </v>
<v Speaker 5>sometimes people find a collapse of </v>

1395
01:14:35.250 --> 01:14:35.290
<v Speaker 5>their faith.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Actually freeing.</v>

1396
01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:40.320
<v Speaker 5>It's certainly the case that many of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>people who are are are happy about what </v>

1397
01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:44.371
<v Speaker 5>you're doing have found exactly that in </v>
<v Speaker 5>what you've been saying and more power </v>

1398
01:14:44.371 --> 01:14:44.920
<v Speaker 5>to you and so I'm not willing to dispute</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

1399
01:14:45.370 --> 01:14:47.200
<v Speaker 5>but what you said was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1400
01:14:47.201 --> 01:14:52.201
<v Speaker 5>here's these belief systems that are </v>
<v Speaker 5>ancient and complex and we can step </v>

1401
01:14:52.201 --> 01:14:56.611
<v Speaker 5>outside of the men.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's this transcendent rationality </v>

1402
01:14:56.611 --> 01:14:56.980
<v Speaker 5>that we could all aspire to that would </v>
<v Speaker 5>solve the problems.</v>

1403
01:14:56.981 --> 01:14:57.700
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1404
01:14:59.070 --> 01:15:00.670
<v Speaker 3>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1405
01:15:00.890 --> 01:15:05.890
<v Speaker 3>what is it exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is at a minimum to value all of the </v>

1406
01:15:07.471 --> 01:15:09.960
<v Speaker 3>variables that conspire to make the one </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

1407
01:15:09.961 --> 01:15:13.410
<v Speaker 3>We know we have key value.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All those variables.</v>

1408
01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:13.650
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1409
01:15:13.750 --> 01:15:18.750
<v Speaker 3>we were doing it right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We do it every day in how we organize </v>

1410
01:15:18.750 --> 01:15:18.750
<v Speaker 3>ourselves.</v>

1411
01:15:18.750 --> 01:15:20.410
<v Speaker 5>Why an a priori framework to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>variables to say,</v>

1412
01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:24.130
<v Speaker 5>to reduce them to a tiny subset that we </v>
<v Speaker 5>can manage and it's the nature of that.</v>

1413
01:15:24.131 --> 01:15:26.980
<v Speaker 5>A priority framework that we haven't </v>
<v Speaker 5>been able to have a discussion about.</v>

1414
01:15:27.700 --> 01:15:31.120
<v Speaker 5>We have an API framework that narrows </v>
<v Speaker 5>our perception to almost nothing.</v>

1415
01:15:31.510 --> 01:15:33.970
<v Speaker 5>It's built into us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's partly socially constructed.</v>

1416
01:15:34.210 --> 01:15:38.560
<v Speaker 5>It has a deep neurological substrate and</v>
<v Speaker 5>we actually understand how it emerges to</v>

1417
01:15:38.561 --> 01:15:41.600
<v Speaker 5>a large degree and the thing is is that </v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't</v>

1418
01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:44.960
<v Speaker 3>think that's actually our difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is a priority for framework,</v>

1419
01:15:44.990 --> 01:15:47.780
<v Speaker 3>operates in many different spaces,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which again,</v>

1420
01:15:47.781 --> 01:15:50.210
<v Speaker 3>we can't necessarily analyze,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it makes it no less true.</v>

1421
01:15:50.211 --> 01:15:52.940
<v Speaker 3>So if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you put your hand on a hot stove,</v>

1422
01:15:53.390 --> 01:15:57.620
<v Speaker 3>you will immediately feel a good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a very good reason.</v>

1423
01:15:57.621 --> 01:16:00.440
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in unarguably good reason to remove it.</v>

1424
01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:01.550
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

1425
01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:04.490
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't require a moral philosophy to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get you there.</v>

1426
01:16:04.700 --> 01:16:09.700
<v Speaker 3>You don't need a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't need to inspect your a priori </v>

1427
01:16:09.700 --> 01:16:09.700
<v Speaker 3>framework.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just have to feel,</v>

1428
01:16:09.700 --> 01:16:10.700
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the worst thing I've ever felt.</v>

1429
01:16:11.060 --> 01:16:13.550
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's so many moments like that in</v>

1430
01:16:13.551 --> 01:16:17.540
<v Speaker 3>life that we dimly under that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand that sometimes to rescue your</v>

1431
01:16:17.541 --> 01:16:18.620
<v Speaker 3>child from a fire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1432
01:16:18.621 --> 01:16:19.300
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you have,</v>

1433
01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:22.220
<v Speaker 3>you have some other goal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1434
01:16:22.980 --> 01:16:25.580
<v Speaker 3>Cause you to brave that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that suffering,</v>

1435
01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:26.560
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1436
01:16:26.630 --> 01:16:31.630
<v Speaker 3>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to rescue your child from a fire </v>

1437
01:16:31.630 --> 01:16:34.600
<v Speaker 3>is pretty close to as the hot stove in </v>
<v Speaker 3>not needing to be analyzed.</v>

1438
01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:38.910
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The imperative to rescue your it,</v>

1439
01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:44.000
<v Speaker 3>it becomes harder when you have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>rescue someone else's child from a fire </v>

1440
01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.610
<v Speaker 3>and you're and you're worried about </v>
<v Speaker 3>orphan in your child who's standing next</v>

1441
01:16:46.611 --> 01:16:47.630
<v Speaker 3>to you on the sidewalk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1442
01:16:47.810 --> 01:16:50.330
<v Speaker 3>Then we get into the domain of moral </v>
<v Speaker 3>philosophy and then you can say,</v>

1443
01:16:50.331 --> 01:16:52.370
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do what?</v>

1444
01:16:52.430 --> 01:16:54.110
<v Speaker 3>How much do each of us?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1445
01:16:54.170 --> 01:16:56.120
<v Speaker 3>the children of other people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1446
01:16:56.180 --> 01:17:00.530
<v Speaker 3>How much did I risk my life and risk </v>
<v Speaker 3>orphaning my child to rescue your child?</v>

1447
01:17:00.740 --> 01:17:05.740
<v Speaker 3>That's when things get interesting in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>philosophy seminar and that's where </v>

1448
01:17:05.740 --> 01:17:09.460
<v Speaker 3>people begin to hesitate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People begin to w we we are biased </v>

1449
01:17:09.460 --> 01:17:10.610
<v Speaker 3>toward protecting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>protecting our kin,</v>

1450
01:17:10.700 --> 01:17:15.700
<v Speaker 3>protecting our friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and only then do we begin to extend the </v>

1451
01:17:15.700 --> 01:17:15.700
<v Speaker 3>circle and again and again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>moral,</v>

1452
01:17:15.700 --> 01:17:18.870
<v Speaker 3>but it's not a mystery where we w,</v>
<v Speaker 3>W,</v>

1453
01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:23.880
<v Speaker 3>we want to go here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We want to extend the circle more and </v>

1454
01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:25.390
<v Speaker 3>more and build institutions and </v>
<v Speaker 3>societies that,</v>

1455
01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:30.480
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that implement our best selves at our </v>

1456
01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:31.130
<v Speaker 3>best moments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>More and more.</v>

1457
01:17:31.131 --> 01:17:35.220
<v Speaker 3>It makes it more effortless to be good </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the defendant.</v>

1458
01:17:35.670 --> 01:17:37.770
<v Speaker 3>Take your example seriously here for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sec.</v>

1459
01:17:37.771 --> 01:17:37.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1460
01:17:38.430 --> 01:17:43.430
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you are built to be more likely to </v>

1461
01:17:43.430 --> 01:17:45.840
<v Speaker 1>rescue your own child in someone else's </v>
<v Speaker 1>child from a fire we in society,</v>

1462
01:17:45.990 --> 01:17:50.990
<v Speaker 1>might like for the minimum number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>children to die in fires as possible,</v>

1463
01:17:51.571 --> 01:17:56.571
<v Speaker 1>which gets you to sideline that </v>
<v Speaker 1>consideration in favor of is there a </v>

1464
01:17:56.571 --> 01:17:57.250
<v Speaker 1>child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1465
01:17:57.350 --> 01:17:58.500
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's faced with a fire,</v>

1466
01:17:58.501 --> 01:18:01.440
<v Speaker 1>who I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who I might rescue religions,</v>

1467
01:18:01.470 --> 01:18:06.470
<v Speaker 1>do exactly this restructuring of values </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they say something like,</v>

1468
01:18:06.990 --> 01:18:11.730
<v Speaker 1>actually your goodness in risking your </v>
<v Speaker 1>own life to save that other child from a</v>

1469
01:18:11.731 --> 01:18:16.731
<v Speaker 1>fire is observed and it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is calculated and you will be </v>

1470
01:18:16.731 --> 01:18:17.310
<v Speaker 1>rewarded for it in some way.</v>

1471
01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:22.400
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's one possible benefit of some </v>

1472
01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:23.070
<v Speaker 3>religions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1473
01:18:23.190 --> 01:18:24.730
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And okay,</v>

1474
01:18:24.750 --> 01:18:29.750
<v Speaker 3>so he put that on the balance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I have a lot to put on the other </v>

1475
01:18:29.750 --> 01:18:30.170
<v Speaker 3>side of the boundary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do I know you list?</v>

1476
01:18:31.310 --> 01:18:32.110
<v Speaker 3>I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1477
01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:35.040
<v Speaker 3>which that's what I'm trying to point </v>
<v Speaker 3>out to Jordan here,</v>

1478
01:18:35.041 --> 01:18:35.690
<v Speaker 3>which he actually</v>

1479
01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:40.840
<v Speaker 1>knowledges,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that he's got a big stack of </v>

1480
01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:42.020
<v Speaker 1>good things that come from this </v>
<v Speaker 1>heuristic,</v>

1481
01:18:42.290 --> 01:18:42.620
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

1482
01:18:42.620 --> 01:18:44.590
<v Speaker 3>he's also acknowledging,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get this.</v>

1483
01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:47.560
<v Speaker 3>This is our core of disagreement here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is however you want to,</v>

1484
01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:52.600
<v Speaker 3>however the balance is going to swing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The difference between us here is that I</v>

1485
01:18:52.671 --> 01:18:57.230
<v Speaker 3>think we read the utility of real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

1486
01:18:57.650 --> 01:18:59.210
<v Speaker 3>of anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in this case,</v>

1487
01:18:59.211 --> 01:19:04.211
<v Speaker 3>religious thinking as evidence of you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you read it as evidence of something </v>

1488
01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:10.840
<v Speaker 3>perhaps is literally true inevitability,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I view that as a kind of version of </v>

1489
01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:18.880
<v Speaker 3>either genetic or naturalistic fallacy </v>
<v Speaker 3>that is just telling you the weather,</v>

1490
01:19:18.940 --> 01:19:21.560
<v Speaker 3>whether that's it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's useful.</v>

1491
01:19:21.561 --> 01:19:24.370
<v Speaker 3>Now here for us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't,</v>

1492
01:19:24.410 --> 01:19:28.250
<v Speaker 3>doesn't argue that it's the best way of </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting those good things.</v>

1493
01:19:28.251 --> 01:19:33.251
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my argument here is that religion gives </v>

1494
01:19:33.251 --> 01:19:33.560
<v Speaker 3>people bad reasons to be good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're good reasons are available.</v>

1495
01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:35.710
<v Speaker 3>So that's a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1496
01:19:36.090 --> 01:19:39.050
<v Speaker 3>Because good real good reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Scale better than bad reasons,</v>

1497
01:19:39.470 --> 01:19:44.470
<v Speaker 3>and I think we can under even if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>take the case where religion is clearly </v>

1498
01:19:44.470 --> 01:19:45.740
<v Speaker 3>useful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Leah,</v>

1499
01:19:45.770 --> 01:19:49.280
<v Speaker 3>in a life saving utterly benign way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1500
01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:51.920
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in virtually all of those cases,</v>

1501
01:19:51.921 --> 01:19:56.921
<v Speaker 3>I think I can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can get you there by some other way </v>

1502
01:19:56.921 --> 01:20:00.371
<v Speaker 3>without the downside or if not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just one of those cases where </v>

1503
01:20:01.071 --> 01:20:06.071
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fiction was more useful than any </v>

1504
01:20:06.071 --> 01:20:06.071
<v Speaker 3>possible.</v>

1505
01:20:06.071 --> 01:20:08.160
<v Speaker 3>Distinguish a religious system from an </v>
<v Speaker 3>eight perceptual</v>

1506
01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:08.610
<v Speaker 5>structure.</v>

1507
01:20:09.630 --> 01:20:12.060
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you can convert to it or away from it</v>

1508
01:20:12.061 --> 01:20:15.270
<v Speaker 3>in a single conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say if it doesn't go very deep,</v>

1509
01:20:15.410 --> 01:20:16.630
<v Speaker 5>well you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're only.</v>

1510
01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:21.960
<v Speaker 5>I would say that for much of that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're only converting at a very </v>

1511
01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:21.960
<v Speaker 5>superficial level.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1512
01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:25.661
<v Speaker 5>no converting at the level of conscious </v>
<v Speaker 5>apprehension and most of your cognition </v>

1513
01:20:25.661 --> 01:20:25.880
<v Speaker 5>is done through unconscious process.</v>

1514
01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:32.200
<v Speaker 3>It's just a fact about us that most of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people's religious attachment is born of</v>

1515
01:20:32.521 --> 01:20:34.740
<v Speaker 3>having it drummed into them by their </v>
<v Speaker 3>parents.</v>

1516
01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:35.760
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I made it,</v>

1517
01:20:35.761 --> 01:20:40.761
<v Speaker 3>but the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't know their parents and their </v>

1518
01:20:40.761 --> 01:20:40.761
<v Speaker 3>parents' parents and their parents </v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't exactly.</v>

1519
01:20:40.761 --> 01:20:42.210
<v Speaker 3>But if we did the same thing with Batman</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Spiderman,</v>

1520
01:20:42.211 --> 01:20:44.560
<v Speaker 3>they would have the same effect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1521
01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:47.130
<v Speaker 3>Like if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you relentlessly told children,</v>

1522
01:20:47.890 --> 01:20:48.280
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1523
01:20:48.310 --> 01:20:53.310
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got two little girls who were </v>

1524
01:20:53.310 --> 01:20:53.310
<v Speaker 3>dressed up like bankroll right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They love batgirl.</v>

1525
01:20:53.310 --> 01:20:56.340
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have to do anything to make them</v>

1526
01:20:56.341 --> 01:21:01.341
<v Speaker 3>more enthusiastic about superheroes </v>
<v Speaker 3>apart from just showing them the </v>

1527
01:21:01.341 --> 01:21:01.341
<v Speaker 3>pictures of superheroes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1528
01:21:01.530 --> 01:21:03.520
<v Speaker 3>If I told them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in addition to how,</v>

1529
01:21:03.570 --> 01:21:05.850
<v Speaker 3>look how fun this is to dress up like </v>
<v Speaker 3>batgirl.</v>

1530
01:21:06.690 --> 01:21:11.690
<v Speaker 3>In addition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to burn in hell for </v>

1531
01:21:11.690 --> 01:21:14.520
<v Speaker 3>eternity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you lose your emotional attachment to</v>

1532
01:21:14.590 --> 01:21:16.680
<v Speaker 3>batgirl even for a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1533
01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:19.260
<v Speaker 3>Well then it's going to be bad girl for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the rest of their lives,</v>

1534
01:21:21.030 --> 01:21:25.320
<v Speaker 3>especially if the entire culture is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is doing likewise.</v>

1535
01:21:25.321 --> 01:21:26.400
<v Speaker 3>And again.</v>

1536
01:21:26.990 --> 01:21:29.870
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as Brett pointed out already,</v>

1537
01:21:29.871 --> 01:21:31.850
<v Speaker 5>a bad tool is better than no tool at </v>
<v Speaker 5>all.</v>

1538
01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:36.880
<v Speaker 5>And if batgirl is the closest </v>
<v Speaker 5>approximation to a divine sacred that </v>

1539
01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:37.730
<v Speaker 5>you can conjure up at beats the hell out</v>
<v Speaker 5>of none at all.</v>

1540
01:21:37.940 --> 01:21:41.270
<v Speaker 5>And if bad girl didn't partake of </v>
<v Speaker 5>certain archetypal structures,</v>

1541
01:21:41.271 --> 01:21:42.350
<v Speaker 5>no one would give a damn about you</v>

1542
01:21:42.490 --> 01:21:43.120
<v Speaker 3>after.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1543
01:21:43.121 --> 01:21:44.740
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to fight a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Batman.</v>

1544
01:21:44.741 --> 01:21:45.470
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to spare you</v>

1545
01:21:45.910 --> 01:21:50.560
<v Speaker 2>play a role in the car because </v>
<v Speaker 2>accidental,</v>

1546
01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:52.030
<v Speaker 2>not accidental,</v>

1547
01:21:52.340 --> 01:21:55.340
<v Speaker 5>that superhero stories have a structure </v>
<v Speaker 5>and to say that,</v>

1548
01:21:55.370 --> 01:22:00.370
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Batman and Spiderman are obvious </v>

1549
01:22:00.370 --> 01:22:00.370
<v Speaker 5>fictions and we could use</v>

1550
01:22:00.380 --> 01:22:02.280
<v Speaker 3>picking the wrong end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're taking the wrong into this.</v>

1551
01:22:02.310 --> 01:22:06.300
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not minimizing the power of stories,</v>

1552
01:22:06.510 --> 01:22:08.520
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying we can understand their power</v>

1553
01:22:08.521 --> 01:22:13.521
<v Speaker 3>without recourse to believing things we </v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't believe now and</v>

1554
01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:18.760
<v Speaker 5>21st century,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we still need an answer to the question </v>

1555
01:22:18.760 --> 01:22:19.560
<v Speaker 5>about what it is that's this </v>
<v Speaker 5>transcendent,</v>

1556
01:22:19.650 --> 01:22:24.260
<v Speaker 5>transcendental rational structure </v>
<v Speaker 5>without an an a priori don't want,</v>

1557
01:22:24.590 --> 01:22:25.520
<v Speaker 5>because I don't see it.</v>

1558
01:22:26.270 --> 01:22:26.960
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we.</v>

1559
01:22:27.080 --> 01:22:32.080
<v Speaker 3>We touched on this a little bit last </v>
<v Speaker 3>night in that I freely admitted that in </v>

1560
01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:37.320
<v Speaker 3>every domain of human inquiry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no matter how the most hard headed,</v>

1561
01:22:37.510 --> 01:22:39.010
<v Speaker 3>so mathematics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>logic,</v>

1562
01:22:39.190 --> 01:22:44.190
<v Speaker 3>physics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at some point we have to pull ourselves </v>

1563
01:22:44.190 --> 01:22:46.630
<v Speaker 3>up by our bootstraps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At some point we make a move that is not</v>

1564
01:22:46.631 --> 01:22:51.631
<v Speaker 3>self justifying and is not justified by </v>
<v Speaker 3>any other move that's more rudimentary,</v>

1565
01:22:52.150 --> 01:22:57.150
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a statement of faith that callow </v>

1566
01:22:57.150 --> 01:23:00.350
<v Speaker 3>use of the term faith.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same precise definition of an axiom,</v>

1567
01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:02.380
<v Speaker 3>my faith,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my faith.</v>

1568
01:23:02.410 --> 01:23:05.680
<v Speaker 3>That two plus two makes four.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not what?</v>

1569
01:23:05.681 --> 01:23:06.010
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it didn't.</v>

1570
01:23:06.011 --> 01:23:10.540
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is My intuition that this is a valid and</v>

1571
01:23:10.541 --> 01:23:13.480
<v Speaker 3>replicable and generalizeable principle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1572
01:23:14.790 --> 01:23:18.030
<v Speaker 5>Neither your statement that that's a </v>
<v Speaker 5>useful claim is a statement of faith.</v>

1573
01:23:18.031 --> 01:23:19.670
<v Speaker 5>But neither of those two were statements</v>
<v Speaker 5>of faith.</v>

1574
01:23:19.700 --> 01:23:21.290
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was their statements.</v>

1575
01:23:21.430 --> 01:23:21.990
<v Speaker 5>Tuition.</v>

1576
01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:23.910
<v Speaker 3>None of those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are intuitions.</v>

1577
01:23:23.970 --> 01:23:28.660
<v Speaker 3>These are because and their intuitions </v>
<v Speaker 3>that can run a foul of other discoveries</v>

1578
01:23:28.661 --> 01:23:31.360
<v Speaker 3>and other intuitions as you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which.</v>

1579
01:23:31.700 --> 01:23:34.350
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if mathematical facts or intuitions then</v>

1580
01:23:34.410 --> 01:23:36.490
<v Speaker 5>what are we doing with?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Take a tape.</v>

1581
01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:37.610
<v Speaker 5>So we've arrived.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1582
01:23:37.611 --> 01:23:37.850
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

1583
01:23:37.900 --> 01:23:38.160
<v Speaker 5>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wait,</v>

1584
01:23:38.161 --> 01:23:38.450
<v Speaker 5>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wait,</v>

1585
01:23:38.460 --> 01:23:39.490
<v Speaker 5>wait.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have to decide.</v>

1586
01:23:39.491 --> 01:23:41.910
<v Speaker 5>The super important that we don't lose </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

1587
01:23:41.950 --> 01:23:42.240
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1588
01:23:43.770 --> 01:23:48.770
<v Speaker 3>So we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for what 2000 years people have been </v>

1589
01:23:48.770 --> 01:23:53.361
<v Speaker 3>studying geometry and had a very well </v>
<v Speaker 3>worked out set of mathematical </v>

1590
01:23:53.521 --> 01:23:56.610
<v Speaker 3>intuitions with respect to Euclidean </v>
<v Speaker 3>space,</v>

1591
01:23:56.640 --> 01:24:01.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>flat geometry and then some brilliant </v>

1592
01:24:01.640 --> 01:24:01.640
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1593
01:24:01.640 --> 01:24:02.030
<v Speaker 3>Remonde might've been the first said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well they actually,</v>

1594
01:24:02.070 --> 01:24:07.070
<v Speaker 3>you can curve space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can bend this triangle and all of a </v>

1595
01:24:07.070 --> 01:24:09.130
<v Speaker 3>sudden it has more than 180 degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1596
01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:12.780
<v Speaker 3>That's an intuition that people tuned up</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty quickly,</v>

1597
01:24:12.781 --> 01:24:16.830
<v Speaker 3>but all of humanity was blind to it for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the longest time.</v>

1598
01:24:16.890 --> 01:24:21.890
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are what I mean by intuition is </v>

1599
01:24:21.890 --> 01:24:25.020
<v Speaker 3>it's the thing you're using to </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand something that you.</v>

1600
01:24:25.170 --> 01:24:27.770
<v Speaker 3>You are not in a position to analyze.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that's,</v>

1601
01:24:28.290 --> 01:24:31.680
<v Speaker 3>but that's not faith of the sort which </v>
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

1602
01:24:32.130 --> 01:24:37.130
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know the Bible was dictated by the </v>

1603
01:24:37.130 --> 01:24:38.040
<v Speaker 3>creator of the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know Jesus was his son.</v>

1604
01:24:38.130 --> 01:24:40.740
<v Speaker 3>I know he rose from the dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know he'll be coming back</v>

1605
01:24:40.790 --> 01:24:43.510
<v Speaker 5>and a thousand other propositional claim</v>
<v Speaker 5>statement.</v>

1606
01:24:43.511 --> 01:24:46.970
<v Speaker 5>It's a highly valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If it's a statement of faith and it's in</v>

1607
01:24:46.971 --> 01:24:49.430
<v Speaker 5>a value domain,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how is it drivable from fact?</v>

1608
01:24:50.780 --> 01:24:55.780
<v Speaker 1>So we've arrived at the point where we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to decide whether to go to q and a </v>

1609
01:24:56.451 --> 01:24:59.570
<v Speaker 1>or to continue the discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While you all are thinking about that,</v>

1610
01:24:59.630 --> 01:25:04.630
<v Speaker 1>I would like to level the challenge to </v>
<v Speaker 1>each of you and then I will pull the </v>

1611
01:25:04.630 --> 01:25:04.790
<v Speaker 1>audience and see what they think about q</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a.</v>

1612
01:25:04.890 --> 01:25:05.660
<v Speaker 1>okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1613
01:25:05.690 --> 01:25:10.690
<v Speaker 1>So Jordan is arguing to you that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>cannot ground the values that would </v>

1614
01:25:15.380 --> 01:25:20.380
<v Speaker 1>undergird the modality of increasing </v>
<v Speaker 1>wellbeing in anything factual and you </v>

1615
01:25:22.431 --> 01:25:24.980
<v Speaker 1>are arguing in response to that.</v>

1616
01:25:25.180 --> 01:25:30.180
<v Speaker 5>Not Without an intermediary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let me just argue in a whole lot of </v>

1617
01:25:30.180 --> 01:25:30.910
<v Speaker 5>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not Without an intermediary struck.</v>

1618
01:25:30.911 --> 01:25:32.910
<v Speaker 5>What I've heard you argue is something </v>
<v Speaker 5>that I,</v>

1619
01:25:32.910 --> 01:25:33.230
<v Speaker 5>that I agree</v>

1620
01:25:33.230 --> 01:25:36.140
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that you can ground many things</v>

1621
01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:39.050
<v Speaker 1>in a nearly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1622
01:25:39.260 --> 01:25:44.260
<v Speaker 1>objective observation of the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't say anything about the </v>

1623
01:25:44.271 --> 01:25:46.370
<v Speaker 1>value part of the equation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>

1624
01:25:46.371 --> 01:25:51.371
<v Speaker 1>I think having thought about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>question from an evolutionary point of </v>

1625
01:25:51.371 --> 01:25:54.191
<v Speaker 1>view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that in order to do what you're talking </v>

1626
01:25:54.191 --> 01:25:54.191
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to increase wellbeing,</v>

1627
01:25:54.191 --> 01:25:58.210
<v Speaker 1>you are going to have to accept that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is going to leave you with an </v>

1628
01:25:58.210 --> 01:26:00.560
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary grounding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no absolute grounding for it.</v>

1629
01:26:00.561 --> 01:26:05.561
<v Speaker 1>And you're going to have to just simply </v>
<v Speaker 1>accept that it's going to you arbitrary </v>

1630
01:26:05.561 --> 01:26:09.101
<v Speaker 1>that you are in fact going to have to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>inconsistent things like decide to honor</v>

1631
01:26:10.010 --> 01:26:15.010
<v Speaker 1>the love of a mother for her child and </v>
<v Speaker 1>dishonor the love of country that causes</v>

1632
01:26:15.470 --> 01:26:18.800
<v Speaker 1>one population to gas another </v>
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>

1633
01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:22.310
<v Speaker 1>That's inconsistent and then will need </v>
<v Speaker 1>to embrace that in kind of inconsistent.</v>

1634
01:26:22.430 --> 01:26:23.660
<v Speaker 3>I've it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a different.</v>

1635
01:26:23.870 --> 01:26:26.400
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we even have the grounding</v>
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>

1636
01:26:26.410 --> 01:26:29.180
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a pseudo problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what you just said,</v>

1637
01:26:29.210 --> 01:26:32.530
<v Speaker 3>we have to put your stuff in somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have a navigate.</v>

1638
01:26:33.130 --> 01:26:38.130
<v Speaker 3>The way it's grounded is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>acknowledgement that what we have is ms </v>

1639
01:26:38.191 --> 01:26:43.191
<v Speaker 3>dot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's analogous to what people do with </v>

1640
01:26:43.191 --> 01:26:44.600
<v Speaker 3>the notion of of meaning in life like </v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the meaning of life?</v>

1641
01:26:44.630 --> 01:26:45.840
<v Speaker 3>How do you find meaning in life?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

1642
01:26:45.841 --> 01:26:48.560
<v Speaker 3>What's the purpose of life?</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are bad questions.</v>

1643
01:26:48.620 --> 01:26:51.530
<v Speaker 3>These are questions that when you pose </v>
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

1644
01:26:51.650 --> 01:26:56.650
<v Speaker 3>they seem to demand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They suggest a space in which an answer </v>

1645
01:26:56.650 --> 01:26:57.320
<v Speaker 3>must be put,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's.</v>

1646
01:26:57.340 --> 01:26:59.670
<v Speaker 3>It's just you put an answer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll.</v>

1647
01:27:00.030 --> 01:27:01.940
<v Speaker 3>People should work towards the good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1648
01:27:01.941 --> 01:27:03.830
<v Speaker 3>there's a different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a different way of framing it,</v>

1649
01:27:03.831 --> 01:27:06.650
<v Speaker 3>which is what we have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here is an opportunity.</v>

1650
01:27:06.710 --> 01:27:07.310
<v Speaker 3>It's not about.</v>

1651
01:27:07.310 --> 01:27:12.310
<v Speaker 3>It's not a matter of meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a matter of purpose and it's </v>

1652
01:27:12.310 --> 01:27:15.461
<v Speaker 3>not a matter of grounding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a matter of we are in a </v>

1653
01:27:15.461 --> 01:27:18.401
<v Speaker 3>circumstance where that where we have </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness and its contents in every </v>

1654
01:27:19.311 --> 01:27:24.311
<v Speaker 3>moment and all of this is that the light</v>
<v Speaker 3>the lights are on and they're on for </v>

1655
01:27:24.441 --> 01:27:27.070
<v Speaker 3>reasons that we dimly understand right </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1656
01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:31.070
<v Speaker 3>These are the reasons that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>biological in our case,</v>

1657
01:27:31.071 --> 01:27:36.071
<v Speaker 3>but perhaps at bottom there just based </v>
<v Speaker 3>on information processing and their </v>

1658
01:27:36.350 --> 01:27:41.350
<v Speaker 3>platform independent and then we would </v>
<v Speaker 3>build machines for whom the life of the </v>

1659
01:27:41.350 --> 01:27:43.250
<v Speaker 3>light is actually on or not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1660
01:27:43.251 --> 01:27:48.251
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it remains to be seen whether we could </v>

1661
01:27:48.251 --> 01:27:50.081
<v Speaker 3>actually build in our computers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>conscious minds that can thrive or </v>

1662
01:27:50.571 --> 01:27:51.320
<v Speaker 3>suffer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1663
01:27:51.321 --> 01:27:56.150
<v Speaker 3>and that the difference matters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we're in a circumstance where we are</v>

1664
01:27:56.151 --> 01:28:01.151
<v Speaker 3>trying to understand how conscious </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness and it states arises,</v>

1665
01:28:02.210 --> 01:28:07.210
<v Speaker 3>but one thing that is undeniable is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>the lights are on and being on.</v>

1666
01:28:11.030 --> 01:28:16.030
<v Speaker 3>They reveal a spectrum of experience </v>
<v Speaker 3>that w,</v>

1667
01:28:16.581 --> 01:28:16.980
<v Speaker 3>w,</v>
<v Speaker 3>W,</v>

1668
01:28:17.660 --> 01:28:20.000
<v Speaker 3>which has one end that we the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1669
01:28:20.070 --> 01:28:25.070
<v Speaker 3>the worse it gets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more compelling it is to move away </v>

1670
01:28:25.070 --> 01:28:26.150
<v Speaker 3>from it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That reading that's meaning,</v>

1671
01:28:26.151 --> 01:28:26.510
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1672
01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:31.520
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So and then and all of our meaning talk </v>

1673
01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:32.840
<v Speaker 3>and value talk relates to navigating in </v>
<v Speaker 3>this space.</v>

1674
01:28:32.841 --> 01:28:37.841
<v Speaker 3>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's one end of it where things get </v>

1675
01:28:37.841 --> 01:28:40.330
<v Speaker 3>needlessly horrible without a silver </v>
<v Speaker 3>lining and there's another end where it </v>

1676
01:28:40.330 --> 01:28:43.871
<v Speaker 3>gets better and better and non zero sum </v>
<v Speaker 3>that all boats are rising with the same </v>

1677
01:28:43.871 --> 01:28:44.820
<v Speaker 3>tide and the Israelis and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Palestinians,</v>

1678
01:28:44.821 --> 01:28:47.490
<v Speaker 3>the landscape cable and good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So okay.</v>

1679
01:28:48.850 --> 01:28:52.300
<v Speaker 3>So these are compelling ways to talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>about this space of,</v>

1680
01:28:52.410 --> 01:28:54.530
<v Speaker 3>of navigation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you do?</v>

1681
01:28:54.530 --> 01:28:54.530
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1682
01:28:54.540 --> 01:28:58.980
<v Speaker 1>when you accept your space of navigation</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a conflict between wellbeing</v>

1683
01:28:58.981 --> 01:29:03.981
<v Speaker 1>for the living population,</v>
<v Speaker 1>earth versus wellbeing over the maximum </v>

1684
01:29:03.991 --> 01:29:08.991
<v Speaker 1>populations that could possibly live </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the future when there's a big </v>

1685
01:29:08.991 --> 01:29:12.621
<v Speaker 1>conflict between how much wellbeing </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to feel now versus how much </v>

1686
01:29:12.621 --> 01:29:14.000
<v Speaker 1>wellbeing future human beings will get </v>
<v Speaker 1>to feel.</v>

1687
01:29:14.060 --> 01:29:14.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that,</v>

1688
01:29:14.801 --> 01:29:18.830
<v Speaker 3>that those are legitimate ethical </v>
<v Speaker 3>problems which we,</v>

1689
01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:24.040
<v Speaker 3>I think we often live in the space where</v>
<v Speaker 3>we know there's a right answer,</v>

1690
01:29:24.710 --> 01:29:29.710
<v Speaker 3>that we are too selfish to fulfill or </v>
<v Speaker 3>too short sided to fulfill.</v>

1691
01:29:30.141 --> 01:29:35.141
<v Speaker 3>Like so I know there are things I do </v>
<v Speaker 3>every day that not only will other </v>

1692
01:29:35.141 --> 01:29:38.180
<v Speaker 3>people as yet unborn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wish I hadn't done,</v>

1693
01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:41.240
<v Speaker 3>I might wake up tomorrow wishing I </v>
<v Speaker 3>hadn't done those things right,</v>

1694
01:29:41.241 --> 01:29:46.241
<v Speaker 3>so like I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a bad friend to my future self in </v>

1695
01:29:46.241 --> 01:29:49.961
<v Speaker 3>some respect to say nothing of the rest </v>
<v Speaker 3>of humanity so we can be so we can have </v>

1696
01:29:49.961 --> 01:29:51.140
<v Speaker 3>failures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can have weakness of will,</v>

1697
01:29:51.320 --> 01:29:54.230
<v Speaker 3>we can have failures that we can just be</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong about certain things,</v>

1698
01:29:54.470 --> 01:29:58.880
<v Speaker 3>but it's nowhere written that is easy to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be a good person.</v>

1699
01:29:59.500 --> 01:30:00.260
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>In that case,</v>

1700
01:30:00.261 --> 01:30:02.980
<v Speaker 3>it's not even clear what good means is </v>
<v Speaker 3>clear.</v>

1701
01:30:02.990 --> 01:30:05.750
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying cases really knows the </v>
<v Speaker 3>answer.</v>

1702
01:30:05.751 --> 01:30:10.751
<v Speaker 3>It might be hard to be motivated by that</v>
<v Speaker 3>knowledge and that because we're not a </v>

1703
01:30:10.751 --> 01:30:10.751
<v Speaker 3>unity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1704
01:30:10.751 --> 01:30:10.751
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of,</v>

1705
01:30:10.751 --> 01:30:15.550
<v Speaker 3>part of what wisdom is morally is an </v>
<v Speaker 3>ability to be,</v>

1706
01:30:16.430 --> 01:30:19.630
<v Speaker 3>to live integrated enough with your own,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1707
01:30:19.940 --> 01:30:24.940
<v Speaker 3>better self.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have the advice you would give to a </v>

1708
01:30:24.940 --> 01:30:27.791
<v Speaker 3>friend of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This just falls right out of your work </v>

1709
01:30:27.791 --> 01:30:28.970
<v Speaker 3>as well as live as though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but basically treat yourself the way you</v>

1710
01:30:28.971 --> 01:30:30.710
<v Speaker 3>would treat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think this is your line,</v>

1711
01:30:30.711 --> 01:30:33.170
<v Speaker 3>so you know someone you you're you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsible for,</v>

1712
01:30:33.171 --> 01:30:34.610
<v Speaker 3>or there's somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a friend of yours,</v>

1713
01:30:34.611 --> 01:30:35.990
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you can,</v>

1714
01:30:36.140 --> 01:30:41.140
<v Speaker 3>if you can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're already ahead of who most people </v>

1715
01:30:41.140 --> 01:30:41.140
<v Speaker 3>are most of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's no.</v>

1716
01:30:41.140 --> 01:30:45.790
<v Speaker 3>There's no reason to say that because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's difficult or because sometimes </v>

1717
01:30:46.251 --> 01:30:49.640
<v Speaker 3>we're looking through a glass darkly and</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't figure out what the answer is.</v>

1718
01:30:49.940 --> 01:30:52.070
<v Speaker 3>The answer doesn't exist or there is no </v>
<v Speaker 3>right one.</v>

1719
01:30:52.700 --> 01:30:56.450
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now let me try with you.</v>

1720
01:30:58.350 --> 01:30:59.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1721
01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:05.560
<v Speaker 1>so Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have argued for a and evolved </v>

1722
01:31:06.560 --> 01:31:11.560
<v Speaker 1>framework of religious belief in which </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are elements that are morally </v>

1723
01:31:12.141 --> 01:31:14.000
<v Speaker 1>defensible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that will be carried through time.</v>

1724
01:31:14.030 --> 01:31:19.030
<v Speaker 1>There are elements that are morally </v>
<v Speaker 1>reprehensible that will be carried </v>

1725
01:31:19.030 --> 01:31:22.031
<v Speaker 1>through time by virtue of the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they are effective and you have argued </v>

1726
01:31:22.281 --> 01:31:27.281
<v Speaker 1>that these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they have withstood the test of </v>

1727
01:31:27.281 --> 01:31:29.780
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have some kind of value,</v>

1728
01:31:29.900 --> 01:31:33.230
<v Speaker 1>which is not necessarily something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we should honor,</v>

1729
01:31:33.231 --> 01:31:38.231
<v Speaker 1>but some large fraction of it must be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that would seem to suggest that the </v>

1730
01:31:40.040 --> 01:31:45.040
<v Speaker 1>degree to which these belief structures </v>
<v Speaker 1>has value is contingent on the degree to</v>

1731
01:31:46.701 --> 01:31:51.701
<v Speaker 1>which the environment in which we </v>
<v Speaker 1>attempt to deploy these structures </v>

1732
01:31:51.701 --> 01:31:52.530
<v Speaker 1>matches the environment in which they </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolved.</v>

1733
01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:54.170
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1734
01:31:54.410 --> 01:31:59.410
<v Speaker 1>I would argue that no population of </v>
<v Speaker 1>humans has lived farther from its </v>

1735
01:31:59.410 --> 01:32:00.670
<v Speaker 1>ancestral environment,</v>

1736
01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:04.390
<v Speaker 5>and we do think that's a fallacy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You think so because,</v>

1737
01:32:04.570 --> 01:32:05.110
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it isn't.</v>

1738
01:32:05.111 --> 01:32:06.070
<v Speaker 5>It isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And look,</v>

1739
01:32:06.071 --> 01:32:08.890
<v Speaker 5>I think that's an absolutely valid </v>
<v Speaker 5>point.</v>

1740
01:32:09.460 --> 01:32:09.940
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

1741
01:32:10.570 --> 01:32:13.600
<v Speaker 5>so this gets esoteric relatively </v>
<v Speaker 5>rapidly,</v>

1742
01:32:13.601 --> 01:32:18.601
<v Speaker 5>but the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say at the highest levels of </v>

1743
01:32:18.601 --> 01:32:22.981
<v Speaker 5>adaptation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're adapted to the things that last </v>

1744
01:32:22.981 --> 01:32:23.860
<v Speaker 5>the longest periods of time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those are the most permanent things.</v>

1745
01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:26.620
<v Speaker 5>Now the question is what are those most </v>
<v Speaker 5>permanent things?</v>

1746
01:32:26.950 --> 01:32:31.950
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one answer would be the fundamental </v>

1747
01:32:31.950 --> 01:32:32.470
<v Speaker 5>material substrate of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's true.</v>

1748
01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:35.590
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to leave that be like we were </v>
<v Speaker 5>evolved to deal with gravity.</v>

1749
01:32:35.690 --> 01:32:40.690
<v Speaker 5>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But there are other elements that are </v>

1750
01:32:40.690 --> 01:32:44.050
<v Speaker 5>higher order abstractions in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 5>that are also apparently hyperreal.</v>

1751
01:32:44.470 --> 01:32:45.980
<v Speaker 5>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's.</v>

1752
01:32:46.110 --> 01:32:48.490
<v Speaker 5>There's a problem that we have a </v>
<v Speaker 5>bifurcated,</v>

1753
01:32:48.810 --> 01:32:50.710
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The question is,</v>

1754
01:32:50.711 --> 01:32:52.480
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why did we have a bifurcated brain?</v>

1755
01:32:52.750 --> 01:32:54.220
<v Speaker 5>And the answer seemed to not just us.</v>

1756
01:32:54.220 --> 01:32:56.350
<v Speaker 5>Animals to Nasser seems to be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1757
01:32:56.351 --> 01:33:01.351
<v Speaker 5>there's two necessary ways of looking at</v>
<v Speaker 5>the world and they have to be in </v>

1758
01:33:01.351 --> 01:33:01.480
<v Speaker 5>conflict to some degree in order to work</v>
<v Speaker 5>properly.</v>

1759
01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:03.910
<v Speaker 5>The right hemisphere and the left </v>
<v Speaker 5>hemisphere,</v>

1760
01:33:04.360 --> 01:33:07.300
<v Speaker 5>the right hemisphere mode is a lot more </v>
<v Speaker 5>metaphorical than the left hemisphere.</v>

1761
01:33:07.780 --> 01:33:12.780
<v Speaker 5>The right hemisphere is the hemisphere </v>
<v Speaker 5>that seems to deal with exceptions to </v>

1762
01:33:12.780 --> 01:33:13.600
<v Speaker 5>the rule,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it seems to deal with the exceptions</v>

1763
01:33:13.601 --> 01:33:16.780
<v Speaker 5>to the rule by men,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by treating them,</v>

1764
01:33:16.810 --> 01:33:21.810
<v Speaker 5>by aggregating them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then trying to recognize patterns </v>

1765
01:33:21.810 --> 01:33:25.111
<v Speaker 5>that unite them as a corrective to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>totalitarian system in some sense that </v>

1766
01:33:25.111 --> 01:33:29.461
<v Speaker 5>the left hemisphere imposes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could say that the right and the </v>

1767
01:33:29.461 --> 01:33:32.431
<v Speaker 5>left are adapted for something like </v>
<v Speaker 5>explored territory for the left and </v>

1768
01:33:32.431 --> 01:33:36.091
<v Speaker 5>unexplored territory for the right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've characterized that is order versus </v>

1769
01:33:36.091 --> 01:33:40.501
<v Speaker 5>chaos and I think the religious </v>
<v Speaker 5>landscape is good versus evil to Sam's </v>

1770
01:33:41.471 --> 01:33:46.471
<v Speaker 5>point that we should strive for a good </v>
<v Speaker 5>life on a landscape of chaos versus </v>

1771
01:33:46.471 --> 01:33:47.710
<v Speaker 5>order,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think that landscape is permanent.</v>

1772
01:33:47.980 --> 01:33:50.710
<v Speaker 5>Now I know we moved from our African </v>
<v Speaker 5>ancestral homeland,</v>

1773
01:33:50.980 --> 01:33:53.710
<v Speaker 5>but these,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this underlying abstraction,</v>

1774
01:33:54.190 --> 01:33:59.190
<v Speaker 5>this underlying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this underlying reality is so profound </v>

1775
01:33:59.190 --> 01:34:02.551
<v Speaker 5>that it it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it maintains its validity across all </v>

1776
01:34:02.551 --> 01:34:02.740
<v Speaker 5>sets of potential environmental </v>
<v Speaker 5>transformations.</v>

1777
01:34:03.220 --> 01:34:04.030
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1778
01:34:04.031 --> 01:34:06.250
<v Speaker 3>Can I just jump in here because here's </v>
<v Speaker 3>why.</v>

1779
01:34:09.640 --> 01:34:12.040
<v Speaker 3>Just to see is on one piece you put in </v>
<v Speaker 3>play there.</v>

1780
01:34:12.041 --> 01:34:16.330
<v Speaker 3>Here's why good and evil can't be </v>
<v Speaker 3>permanent in the usual sense.</v>

1781
01:34:16.331 --> 01:34:18.610
<v Speaker 3>Certainly not in the Christian Judeo </v>
<v Speaker 3>Christian sense.</v>

1782
01:34:18.850 --> 01:34:23.850
<v Speaker 3>One is the Judeo Christian notion of </v>
<v Speaker 3>good and evil doesn't even map onto to </v>

1783
01:34:24.070 --> 01:34:27.730
<v Speaker 3>eastern religion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You made a good evil versus good claimed</v>

1784
01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:32.840
<v Speaker 3>in the moral but it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's also in an eastern context and </v>

1785
01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:34.930
<v Speaker 3>a Buddhist or Hindu context.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The evil isn't really evil.</v>

1786
01:34:34.931 --> 01:34:39.931
<v Speaker 3>It's just ignorance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you might dispute that you might </v>

1787
01:34:39.931 --> 01:34:39.931
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's not really.</v>

1788
01:34:39.931 --> 01:34:41.350
<v Speaker 3>They haven't met a sufficiently evil </v>
<v Speaker 3>person to if they can think that,</v>

1789
01:34:41.380 --> 01:34:46.380
<v Speaker 3>but the reality is that billions of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who have a different rubric under</v>

1790
01:34:47.480 --> 01:34:50.710
<v Speaker 3>wisdom make the case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but let's let.</v>

1791
01:34:50.730 --> 01:34:54.550
<v Speaker 3>Let me add another another piece here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're just going to ask them,</v>

1792
01:34:54.580 --> 01:34:55.300
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need.</v>

1793
01:34:55.540 --> 01:34:58.490
<v Speaker 3>You guys need to go guys want this to </v>
<v Speaker 3>continue?</v>

1794
01:34:58.550 --> 01:35:00.380
<v Speaker 5>Or do you want q and a to begin?</v>

1795
01:35:01.630 --> 01:35:03.340
<v Speaker 2>I don't know which one you're fearing </v>
<v Speaker 2>for.</v>

1796
01:35:03.850 --> 01:35:05.250
<v Speaker 2>Give them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Give them</v>

1797
01:35:05.730 --> 01:35:10.160
<v Speaker 5>first group is the group that wants this</v>
<v Speaker 5>conversation to continue.</v>

1798
01:35:18.780 --> 01:35:21.500
<v Speaker 2>Now the group that would prefer</v>

1799
01:35:21.570 --> 01:35:22.170
<v Speaker 5>q and a,</v>

1800
01:35:25.640 --> 01:35:27.520
<v Speaker 2>it was the former.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

1801
01:35:28.840 --> 01:35:31.250
<v Speaker 5>What's disturbing is that many of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>same people were laughing.</v>

1802
01:35:32.770 --> 01:35:35.230
<v Speaker 5>Proves what Jordan was saying about the </v>
<v Speaker 5>two hemispheres,</v>

1803
01:35:35.380 --> 01:35:40.380
<v Speaker 5>the brain metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I mean it seems to me,</v>

1804
01:35:41.081 --> 01:35:42.850
<v Speaker 5>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>correct me if I'm wrong,</v>

1805
01:35:42.851 --> 01:35:47.851
<v Speaker 5>is that you made an absolute world claim</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the moral landscape and that's what </v>

1806
01:35:47.851 --> 01:35:48.320
<v Speaker 5>grounds here argument</v>

1807
01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:52.440
<v Speaker 3>these because it'll be interesting if </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not totally on point.</v>

1808
01:35:52.980 --> 01:35:57.980
<v Speaker 3>The reason why evil is susceptible to </v>
<v Speaker 3>total deflation is if you agree with me,</v>

1809
01:36:00.450 --> 01:36:05.450
<v Speaker 3>evil is a category of human misbehavior,</v>
<v Speaker 3>human intention that we don't understand</v>

1810
01:36:08.970 --> 01:36:13.970
<v Speaker 3>significantly at the level of the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if we did understand it totally at </v>

1811
01:36:13.970 --> 01:36:18.321
<v Speaker 3>the level of the brain than every evil </v>
<v Speaker 3>person we had in the doc at trial would </v>

1812
01:36:18.691 --> 01:36:23.691
<v Speaker 3>be just like Charles Whitman with his </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain tumor after he shot up everyone at</v>

1813
01:36:24.660 --> 01:36:26.070
<v Speaker 3>the University of Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1814
01:36:26.071 --> 01:36:27.740
<v Speaker 3>So like he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he is,</v>

1815
01:36:27.990 --> 01:36:30.810
<v Speaker 3>he's the prototypically evil mass </v>
<v Speaker 3>murder,</v>

1816
01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:36.080
<v Speaker 3>but he's complaining about this change </v>
<v Speaker 3>that overcame his personality and he </v>

1817
01:36:36.080 --> 01:36:40.911
<v Speaker 3>thinks it would be good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A good idea that if after the cops kill </v>

1818
01:36:40.911 --> 01:36:44.511
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you autopsy my brain because I don't </v>

1819
01:36:44.511 --> 01:36:44.511
<v Speaker 3>know why I'm doing any of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1820
01:36:44.511 --> 01:36:48.470
<v Speaker 3>And Lo and behold,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had a glioblastoma pressing on his </v>

1821
01:36:48.470 --> 01:36:51.201
<v Speaker 3>amygdala and all of a sudden it made </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense of his behavior in a way that a </v>

1822
01:36:51.201 --> 01:36:55.161
<v Speaker 3>full understanding of psychopathy or </v>
<v Speaker 3>every other variant of human evil would </v>

1823
01:36:55.161 --> 01:36:58.620
<v Speaker 3>make sense of it in a way that would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>deflationary ethically.</v>

1824
01:36:58.620 --> 01:37:03.620
<v Speaker 3>And then you would look at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then you look at someone like Saddam </v>

1825
01:37:03.620 --> 01:37:04.560
<v Speaker 3>Hussein or the worst evil person you </v>
<v Speaker 3>could imagine,</v>

1826
01:37:05.250 --> 01:37:06.570
<v Speaker 3>and you would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1827
01:37:07.080 --> 01:37:12.080
<v Speaker 3>he's actually unlucky you know there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for the grace of biology,</v>

1828
01:37:12.150 --> 01:37:15.210
<v Speaker 3>go on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because if I had that brain,</v>

1829
01:37:15.211 --> 01:37:20.211
<v Speaker 3>if I had those jeans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I had those influences that gave me </v>

1830
01:37:20.211 --> 01:37:21.060
<v Speaker 3>those synapses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would be just like him.</v>

1831
01:37:21.210 --> 01:37:26.210
<v Speaker 3>Now if you think there's some other </v>
<v Speaker 3>element that gives us free will and now </v>

1832
01:37:26.210 --> 01:37:26.210
<v Speaker 3>then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then,</v>

1833
01:37:26.210 --> 01:37:28.200
<v Speaker 3>then you and I are disagree that that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>a factual claim.</v>

1834
01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:30.360
<v Speaker 3>That's at variance with mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1835
01:37:30.390 --> 01:37:35.390
<v Speaker 3>but if we are just on some level now a </v>
<v Speaker 3>malfunctioning biological systems when </v>

1836
01:37:36.421 --> 01:37:41.421
<v Speaker 3>we're being evil than a complete </v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding of evil would cancel that </v>

1837
01:37:41.421 --> 01:37:43.290
<v Speaker 3>category.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you define evil?</v>

1838
01:37:43.291 --> 01:37:45.830
<v Speaker 3>So we know what you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well just take,</v>

1839
01:37:45.890 --> 01:37:50.760
<v Speaker 3>take the just the worst people who have </v>
<v Speaker 3>statistically victimized the most people</v>

1840
01:37:50.761 --> 01:37:52.970
<v Speaker 3>and those are the evil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>evil people.</v>

1841
01:37:53.830 --> 01:37:58.830
<v Speaker 5>So when you say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I think this is actually really </v>

1842
01:37:58.830 --> 01:38:01.101
<v Speaker 5>important.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I think actual evil of that kind is </v>

1843
01:38:01.101 --> 01:38:03.801
<v Speaker 5>pretty darn rare.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there's a lot of badness that email </v>

1844
01:38:03.801 --> 01:38:06.900
<v Speaker 5>from one of the most troubling thing or </v>
<v Speaker 5>all the good people doing evil because </v>

1845
01:38:06.900 --> 01:38:10.370
<v Speaker 5>they're ruled by bad ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that I think is more consequential </v>

1846
01:38:10.370 --> 01:38:13.641
<v Speaker 5>than we actually.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We introduced a whole set of other </v>

1847
01:38:13.641 --> 01:38:14.790
<v Speaker 5>things here in the last little round </v>
<v Speaker 5>with freewill and evil,</v>

1848
01:38:14.791 --> 01:38:15.170
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

1849
01:38:15.240 --> 01:38:15.880
<v Speaker 5>but just to</v>

1850
01:38:16.290 --> 01:38:19.170
<v Speaker 3>want to make it clear why I went there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were saying this is,</v>

1851
01:38:19.400 --> 01:38:20.970
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

1852
01:38:21.060 --> 01:38:26.060
<v Speaker 3>I forgot the word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You used inevitable or ineluctable </v>

1853
01:38:26.550 --> 01:38:30.780
<v Speaker 3>Lloyd's permit applications that this </v>
<v Speaker 3>category is permanent.</v>

1854
01:38:30.781 --> 01:38:35.781
<v Speaker 3>And I'm saying that I don't think but </v>
<v Speaker 3>equal in that sense as a permanent </v>

1855
01:38:35.781 --> 01:38:39.411
<v Speaker 3>category for us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do weights more information and </v>

1856
01:38:39.411 --> 01:38:39.411
<v Speaker 3>insight.</v>

1857
01:38:39.411 --> 01:38:40.070
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're going to distinguish for a minute.</v>

1858
01:38:40.130 --> 01:38:45.130
<v Speaker 5>Good versus evil and good versus bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just for the sake of conceptual clarity </v>

1859
01:38:45.320 --> 01:38:49.520
<v Speaker 5>in the moral landscape,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you make a fundamental axiomatic plane,</v>

1860
01:38:50.600 --> 01:38:52.890
<v Speaker 5>looks like a moral claim.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe it's claim of fact.</v>

1861
01:38:52.910 --> 01:38:56.150
<v Speaker 5>And the claim is there are bad lives and</v>
<v Speaker 5>good lives.</v>

1862
01:38:56.300 --> 01:38:58.070
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the claim you make is that,</v>

1863
01:38:58.071 --> 01:39:03.071
<v Speaker 5>that's universally true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's true for the requisite lines,</v>

1864
01:39:04.100 --> 01:39:05.000
<v Speaker 5>Buddhist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hindu,</v>

1865
01:39:05.240 --> 01:39:06.050
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

1866
01:39:06.450 --> 01:39:07.770
<v Speaker 3>but evil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so yes,</v>

1867
01:39:07.810 --> 01:39:12.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not telling you that you should </v>

1868
01:39:12.810 --> 01:39:12.810
<v Speaker 3>purge the word evil from your your </v>
<v Speaker 3>vocabulary.</v>

1869
01:39:12.870 --> 01:39:16.350
<v Speaker 3>I use the word all the time and I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's useful to motivating word.</v>

1870
01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:21.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying that it's there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can understand this continuum of good</v>

1871
01:39:21.241 --> 01:39:26.241
<v Speaker 3>and bad or positive and negative in ways</v>
<v Speaker 3>that don't use the.</v>

1872
01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:32.120
<v Speaker 3>The.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Certainly don't use the Judeo Christian </v>

1873
01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:32.740
<v Speaker 3>framework for value in these things </v>
<v Speaker 3>because if you.</v>

1874
01:39:32.741 --> 01:39:35.570
<v Speaker 3>If you take the Buddhist framework and </v>
<v Speaker 3>map it onto this,</v>

1875
01:39:35.620 --> 01:39:38.280
<v Speaker 3>this continuum,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't get good and evil.</v>

1876
01:39:38.580 --> 01:39:43.580
<v Speaker 3>You get essentially wisdom and ignorance</v>
<v Speaker 3>in an evil is ignorance of all the </v>

1877
01:39:44.341 --> 01:39:48.120
<v Speaker 3>wellbeing you would you and others would</v>
<v Speaker 3>experience if you behaved another way.</v>

1878
01:39:48.420 --> 01:39:53.420
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the Buddhist game and we're even </v>

1879
01:39:53.420 --> 01:39:53.520
<v Speaker 3>within Hinduism and they get this </v>
<v Speaker 3>connects to your.</v>

1880
01:39:53.580 --> 01:39:55.830
<v Speaker 3>Your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your love of stories.</v>

1881
01:39:55.831 --> 01:39:56.690
<v Speaker 3>You take the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1882
01:39:56.760 --> 01:39:58.110
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Hindu texts.</v>

1883
01:39:58.110 --> 01:40:00.380
<v Speaker 3>The Ramayana,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is just a foundation,</v>

1884
01:40:00.590 --> 01:40:05.590
<v Speaker 3>is doing the work that the Bible is </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing for Jews and Christians in that.</v>

1885
01:40:05.790 --> 01:40:09.330
<v Speaker 3>The worst guy in the Ramayana,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the 10 headed Demon Rovena,</v>

1886
01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:12.660
<v Speaker 3>the prototypically evil person is at </v>
<v Speaker 3>bottom.</v>

1887
01:40:12.870 --> 01:40:17.870
<v Speaker 3>Really not a bad guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a great sage who is just in a bad </v>

1888
01:40:17.870 --> 01:40:18.160
<v Speaker 3>mood essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1889
01:40:18.430 --> 01:40:23.430
<v Speaker 3>He was was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was obscured by ignorance and so it </v>

1890
01:40:23.430 --> 01:40:23.430
<v Speaker 3>isn't the Buddhist cannon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Buddhist,</v>

1891
01:40:23.430 --> 01:40:28.030
<v Speaker 3>the Buddha made say a serial killer who </v>
<v Speaker 3>knows wearing a garland of human fingers</v>

1892
01:40:28.801 --> 01:40:32.010
<v Speaker 3>around his neck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>named ongoing on Gooley Mala,</v>

1893
01:40:32.460 --> 01:40:36.480
<v Speaker 3>but he was just one conversation away </v>
<v Speaker 3>from being fully enlightened.</v>

1894
01:40:36.481 --> 01:40:36.810
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1895
01:40:36.811 --> 01:40:41.811
<v Speaker 3>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a different picture of a </v>

1896
01:40:41.811 --> 01:40:41.811
<v Speaker 3>possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying one is right or wrong.</v>

1897
01:40:41.811 --> 01:40:43.170
<v Speaker 3>Let's be agnostic about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just.</v>

1898
01:40:43.171 --> 01:40:48.171
<v Speaker 3>I'm challenging your claim that there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>something so precious and useful and </v>

1899
01:40:48.171 --> 01:40:49.650
<v Speaker 3>durable about the Judeo Christian</v>

1900
01:40:49.900 --> 01:40:52.420
<v Speaker 5>I wasn't making.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wasn't making what we're stuck with it</v>

1901
01:40:52.421 --> 01:40:54.340
<v Speaker 5>for all time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You see making that claim.</v>

1902
01:40:54.341 --> 01:40:59.341
<v Speaker 5>I was making the claim that in the moral</v>
<v Speaker 5>landscape you laid out a distinction </v>

1903
01:40:59.341 --> 01:41:02.260
<v Speaker 5>between the bird life and the good life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Forget about rutten evil,</v>

1904
01:41:02.290 --> 01:41:04.660
<v Speaker 5>the bad life and the good life Hell and </v>
<v Speaker 5>heaven,</v>

1905
01:41:05.040 --> 01:41:10.040
<v Speaker 5>bad life and the good life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that that distinction was not only </v>

1906
01:41:10.040 --> 01:41:11.110
<v Speaker 5>factual but universal</v>

1907
01:41:11.540 --> 01:41:16.010
<v Speaker 3>and so you the right mind so that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>could imagine a mind.</v>

1908
01:41:16.540 --> 01:41:17.360
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is an example.</v>

1909
01:41:17.361 --> 01:41:22.361
<v Speaker 3>I think in a right mind you we can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can create circumstances that seem </v>

1910
01:41:22.361 --> 01:41:24.230
<v Speaker 3>perverse to us that we were would recoil</v>
<v Speaker 3>from.</v>

1911
01:41:24.231 --> 01:41:28.070
<v Speaker 3>You could you could create a universe of</v>
<v Speaker 3>perfectly matched,</v>

1912
01:41:28.100 --> 01:41:33.100
<v Speaker 3>say this and masochists say right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you have the people who are real </v>

1913
01:41:33.100 --> 01:41:35.030
<v Speaker 3>sadists who in our world would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible actors,</v>

1914
01:41:35.240 --> 01:41:39.050
<v Speaker 3>but in their world they're surrounded by</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who want to be mistreated.</v>

1915
01:41:39.100 --> 01:41:39.690
<v Speaker 3>Now again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this may</v>

1916
01:41:40.030 --> 01:41:42.890
<v Speaker 5>real estate is you never mistreated </v>
<v Speaker 5>masochist when he asks you,</v>

1917
01:41:42.930 --> 01:41:43.210
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1918
01:41:43.320 --> 01:41:48.320
<v Speaker 2>well these are not</v>

1919
01:41:53.010 --> 01:41:58.010
<v Speaker 3>for the human categories even exists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in some we undoubtedly we could </v>

1920
01:41:59.881 --> 01:42:03.440
<v Speaker 3>create something like an artificial </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence that could be google.</v>

1921
01:42:03.530 --> 01:42:08.530
<v Speaker 3>It could be paired this way and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>would be weird,</v>

1922
01:42:09.030 --> 01:42:11.250
<v Speaker 3>but on my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my framework,</v>

1923
01:42:11.530 --> 01:42:16.530
<v Speaker 3>it is a conceivable space of equivalent </v>
<v Speaker 3>wellbeing and if it's not matched at all</v>

1924
01:42:17.881 --> 01:42:19.180
<v Speaker 3>to our space,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1925
01:42:19.190 --> 01:42:20.370
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's if,</v>

1926
01:42:20.460 --> 01:42:25.460
<v Speaker 3>if in fact we could inspect the </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscious minds of all parties </v>

1927
01:42:25.460 --> 01:42:29.450
<v Speaker 3>participate in that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is not obviously absurd by in my view</v>

1928
01:42:30.060 --> 01:42:33.720
<v Speaker 3>to say that they are just as happy as we</v>
<v Speaker 3>are in this conversation.</v>

1929
01:42:33.730 --> 01:42:38.730
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some moments in this conversation I </v>

1930
01:42:38.730 --> 01:42:38.730
<v Speaker 3>would say that they might be happier.</v>

1931
01:42:38.730 --> 01:42:38.730
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's been good.</v>

1932
01:42:38.730 --> 01:42:39.270
<v Speaker 5>It's been good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So let me,</v>

1933
01:42:39.271 --> 01:42:42.720
<v Speaker 5>let me ask you a question here about </v>
<v Speaker 5>wellbeing because this is something I've</v>

1934
01:42:42.721 --> 01:42:45.780
<v Speaker 5>wanted to ask you about but we never </v>
<v Speaker 5>seem to get to is.</v>

1935
01:42:45.870 --> 01:42:50.870
<v Speaker 5>So you think that we should maximize </v>
<v Speaker 5>wellbeing and that's part of your </v>

1936
01:42:50.870 --> 01:42:54.351
<v Speaker 5>proposition,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which which I don't entirely disagree </v>

1937
01:42:54.351 --> 01:42:55.370
<v Speaker 5>with by the way that we should ground </v>
<v Speaker 5>our value starches in fact,</v>

1938
01:42:55.600 --> 01:42:56.670
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

1939
01:42:56.780 --> 01:42:59.280
<v Speaker 5>but there's a black box problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>

1940
01:42:59.281 --> 01:43:03.570
<v Speaker 5>I think the black box problem about the </v>
<v Speaker 5>April restructure that we use to extract</v>

1941
01:43:03.780 --> 01:43:08.780
<v Speaker 5>the facts of the world out and the black</v>
<v Speaker 5>box problem is if we could measure </v>

1942
01:43:09.481 --> 01:43:11.060
<v Speaker 5>wellbeing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

1943
01:43:11.700 --> 01:43:13.320
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a big problem Sam.</v>

1944
01:43:13.370 --> 01:43:15.660
<v Speaker 5>Like we have measures of wellbeing and </v>
<v Speaker 5>their terrible.</v>

1945
01:43:16.500 --> 01:43:17.160
<v Speaker 5>Yes they are.</v>

1946
01:43:17.470 --> 01:43:17.950
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1947
01:43:17.951 --> 01:43:19.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm agreeing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

1948
01:43:19.221 --> 01:43:24.221
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not a problem for my thesis is </v>

1949
01:43:24.221 --> 01:43:24.910
<v Speaker 3>we don't have measures for anything we </v>
<v Speaker 3>care about.</v>

1950
01:43:25.330 --> 01:43:26.580
<v Speaker 5>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're,</v>

1951
01:43:26.670 --> 01:43:31.670
<v Speaker 5>if your thesis is that if we had the </v>
<v Speaker 5>measures of wellbeing that were </v>

1952
01:43:31.670 --> 01:43:35.131
<v Speaker 5>appropriate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we could use them in a positive way and </v>

1953
01:43:35.131 --> 01:43:35.470
<v Speaker 5>the responses,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we don't have those measures.</v>

1954
01:43:35.471 --> 01:43:36.190
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1955
01:43:36.191 --> 01:43:36.940
<v Speaker 5>well then what do we do?</v>

1956
01:43:37.110 --> 01:43:37.500
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1957
01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:39.050
<v Speaker 3>but we have measures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1958
01:43:39.140 --> 01:43:42.270
<v Speaker 3>this conversation is a measure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like that.</v>

1959
01:43:42.330 --> 01:43:43.530
<v Speaker 3>That's a measure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1960
01:43:43.531 --> 01:43:46.260
<v Speaker 3>You step on my toe and I say out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a measure.</v>

1961
01:43:46.261 --> 01:43:46.960
<v Speaker 3>Don't do that and get</v>

1962
01:43:47.550 --> 01:43:49.730
<v Speaker 5>for your wellbeing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It might be a measure of your treat.</v>

1963
01:43:49.731 --> 01:43:50.390
<v Speaker 5>Neuroticism.</v>

1964
01:43:50.720 --> 01:43:55.720
<v Speaker 1>What it is a measure of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's technically,</v>

1965
01:43:56.990 --> 01:43:59.870
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the wellbeing measures </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we have,</v>

1966
01:44:00.730 --> 01:44:03.020
<v Speaker 1>they degenerate it to measures of </v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism.</v>

1967
01:44:03.120 --> 01:44:04.400
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't.</v>

1968
01:44:04.401 --> 01:44:07.970
<v Speaker 1>We don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we don't have measures of certainty,</v>

1969
01:44:08.210 --> 01:44:10.550
<v Speaker 1>of belief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of compassion,</v>

1970
01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:12.500
<v Speaker 1>of joy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1971
01:44:12.590 --> 01:44:14.390
<v Speaker 1>of any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any of these conscious states we have.</v>

1972
01:44:14.391 --> 01:44:16.100
<v Speaker 1>We have neural correlates of some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

1973
01:44:16.280 --> 01:44:17.760
<v Speaker 1>but we don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got,</v>

1974
01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:22.840
<v Speaker 1>there's no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then how helmet writes about them </v>

1975
01:44:22.840 --> 01:44:23.330
<v Speaker 1>to Orient Ourselves in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dan,</v>

1976
01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:25.820
<v Speaker 1>because we're doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're doing this all the time.</v>

1977
01:44:26.540 --> 01:44:29.000
<v Speaker 1>If you've got an instantaneous measure </v>
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>

1978
01:44:29.240 --> 01:44:31.190
<v Speaker 1>you've got an instantaneous measure of </v>
<v Speaker 1>wellbeing,</v>

1979
01:44:31.191 --> 01:44:33.260
<v Speaker 1>we can all check with ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see how we feel,</v>

1980
01:44:33.470 --> 01:44:35.330
<v Speaker 1>but it's possible to be wrong about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1981
01:44:37.450 --> 01:44:39.250
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1982
01:44:39.680 --> 01:44:44.680
<v Speaker 1>it degrades as you get away from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual's ability to check internally</v>

1983
01:44:45.590 --> 01:44:50.590
<v Speaker 1>on the internal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the internal thing isn't reliable or </v>

1984
01:44:50.590 --> 01:44:54.110
<v Speaker 1>happy when you're doing things that will</v>
<v Speaker 1>take a drug that would make you feel </v>

1985
01:44:54.110 --> 01:44:57.371
<v Speaker 1>very good and would cause you to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>apart your own life because it would be </v>

1986
01:44:57.371 --> 01:44:57.371
<v Speaker 1>like cocaine.</v>

1987
01:44:57.371 --> 01:45:00.340
<v Speaker 1>It would destroy the motivational </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure that gets you to do stumps,</v>

1988
01:45:00.380 --> 01:45:02.050
<v Speaker 1>stuff of value that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1989
01:45:02.051 --> 01:45:04.400
<v Speaker 1>that your rights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't use emotion.</v>

1990
01:45:04.770 --> 01:45:08.000
<v Speaker 1>That emotion as an indicator of </v>
<v Speaker 1>instantaneous is not good,</v>

1991
01:45:08.180 --> 01:45:13.180
<v Speaker 1>but you have a parallel problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks to me like the exact mirror </v>

1992
01:45:13.180 --> 01:45:17.261
<v Speaker 1>image,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that you've got an integrative </v>

1993
01:45:17.261 --> 01:45:21.100
<v Speaker 1>long term measure of wellbeing </v>
<v Speaker 1>instantiated in an evolutionary belief </v>

1994
01:45:21.201 --> 01:45:26.201
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's coming apart because we are </v>

1995
01:45:26.201 --> 01:45:27.590
<v Speaker 1>living in circumstances that are less </v>
<v Speaker 1>well mirrored.</v>

1996
01:45:28.070 --> 01:45:33.070
<v Speaker 1>The president does not mirror the past </v>
<v Speaker 1>and therefore these truths which you </v>

1997
01:45:33.070 --> 01:45:34.900
<v Speaker 1>believe are timeless or degrading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1998
01:45:34.940 --> 01:45:36.120
<v Speaker 1>rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's part of.</v>

1999
01:45:36.370 --> 01:45:37.400
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2000
01:45:37.401 --> 01:45:41.570
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what Sam is arguing is that the tools</v>

2001
01:45:41.571 --> 01:45:45.170
<v Speaker 1>to pivot in order to improve our way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>interacting,</v>

2002
01:45:45.380 --> 01:45:48.530
<v Speaker 1>those are not the tools of long standing</v>
<v Speaker 1>tradition.</v>

2003
01:45:48.531 --> 01:45:51.110
<v Speaker 1>Those are the tools of rational </v>
<v Speaker 1>engagement,</v>

2004
01:45:51.170 --> 01:45:54.260
<v Speaker 1>respect for that process as part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>longest standing tradition.</v>

2005
01:45:54.410 --> 01:45:55.640
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

2006
01:45:55.690 --> 01:45:57.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's a big truth,</v>

2007
01:45:57.021 --> 01:45:58.810
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a major league truth.</v>

2008
01:45:59.330 --> 01:46:04.330
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say the fundamental tradition </v>

2009
01:46:04.330 --> 01:46:06.830
<v Speaker 1>that most fundamental tradition of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>West says that respect for the process,</v>

2010
01:46:06.831 --> 01:46:11.831
<v Speaker 1>that updates moral judgment is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>highest of all possible values and </v>

2011
01:46:11.831 --> 01:46:12.950
<v Speaker 1>that's also built into the tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Strangely enough,</v>

2012
01:46:13.100 --> 01:46:15.440
<v Speaker 1>I agree it's built into the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the tradition,</v>

2013
01:46:15.441 --> 01:46:19.790
<v Speaker 1>but I would argue that it is very likely</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be compartmentalized.</v>

2014
01:46:19.850 --> 01:46:24.850
<v Speaker 1>In other words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a little bit struck when you said </v>

2015
01:46:24.850 --> 01:46:24.850
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2016
01:46:24.850 --> 01:46:29.530
<v Speaker 1>what did you say about scaling?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You said that,</v>

2017
01:46:29.960 --> 01:46:34.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the good reasons scale and batteries is </v>

2018
01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:38.920
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't that the opposite of the truth </v>

2019
01:46:38.920 --> 01:46:42.240
<v Speaker 1>calling if you're calling these stories </v>
<v Speaker 1>that give prescriptions for how to </v>

2020
01:46:42.240 --> 01:46:46.841
<v Speaker 1>behave bad ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The point is those stories propagate </v>

2021
01:46:46.841 --> 01:46:47.030
<v Speaker 1>very easily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was so.</v>

2022
01:46:47.270 --> 01:46:52.270
<v Speaker 1>Whereas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if we want to talk about the gun and </v>

2023
01:46:52.270 --> 01:46:55.431
<v Speaker 1>whether it is loaded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that the gun is definitely </v>

2024
01:46:55.431 --> 01:46:56.310
<v Speaker 1>loaded that scales really easily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2025
01:46:56.311 --> 01:46:58.050
<v Speaker 1>You can pass that along in one sentence.</v>

2026
01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:02.500
<v Speaker 3>I'm wrong about a loaded gun also scale,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2027
01:47:02.501 --> 01:47:03.600
<v Speaker 3>So no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2028
01:47:03.640 --> 01:47:05.000
<v Speaker 3>they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Want to talk to</v>

2029
01:47:05.560 --> 01:47:10.560
<v Speaker 1>about very small possibilities of very </v>
<v Speaker 1>dire things happening.</v>

2030
01:47:11.140 --> 01:47:13.270
<v Speaker 1>They trip over it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard thing to get.</v>

2031
01:47:13.271 --> 01:47:15.580
<v Speaker 1>It's almost impossible for them to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2032
01:47:15.700 --> 01:47:18.640
<v Speaker 1>So the point is the one thing does scale</v>
<v Speaker 1>story that says yeah,</v>

2033
01:47:18.641 --> 01:47:20.800
<v Speaker 1>every gun is loaded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a false story,</v>

2034
01:47:20.920 --> 01:47:25.690
<v Speaker 1>but that one definitely scaled this </v>
<v Speaker 1>statistical reality of guns and the fact</v>

2035
01:47:25.691 --> 01:47:30.691
<v Speaker 1>that they may indeed beyond loaded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't want to play around with </v>

2036
01:47:30.691 --> 01:47:32.290
<v Speaker 1>the remote possibility that one day </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll get it wrong,</v>

2037
01:47:32.500 --> 01:47:37.500
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't scale because it requires </v>

2038
01:47:37.500 --> 01:47:37.630
<v Speaker 1>you to have experienced with stuff that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is not common.</v>

2039
01:47:38.090 --> 01:47:38.460
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2040
01:47:38.530 --> 01:47:39.530
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the two things there,</v>

2041
01:47:39.830 --> 01:47:42.980
<v Speaker 3>one of you bring up as an ancillary but </v>
<v Speaker 3>very important point,</v>

2042
01:47:42.981 --> 01:47:47.981
<v Speaker 3>which is that moral progress here is </v>
<v Speaker 3>often the result of moving from our </v>

2043
01:47:53.720 --> 01:47:58.720
<v Speaker 3>story-driven protagonists driven </v>
<v Speaker 3>intuitions to something far more </v>

2044
01:47:59.151 --> 01:48:00.500
<v Speaker 3>quantified.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2045
01:48:00.501 --> 01:48:01.700
<v Speaker 3>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a classic,</v>

2046
01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:05.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>moral study done by Paul Slovako,</v>

2047
01:48:05.030 --> 01:48:10.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you are aware of where you tell</v>
<v Speaker 3>people about one needy little girl in </v>

2048
01:48:11.061 --> 01:48:12.830
<v Speaker 3>Africa and you give her a name and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2049
01:48:12.831 --> 01:48:16.430
<v Speaker 3>and show her picture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what you elicit is the maximum,</v>

2050
01:48:16.610 --> 01:48:19.250
<v Speaker 3>our truest compassionate response from </v>
<v Speaker 3>subjects.</v>

2051
01:48:19.550 --> 01:48:24.550
<v Speaker 3>You go to another group of subjects,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you tell them about the same little </v>

2052
01:48:24.550 --> 01:48:24.550
<v Speaker 3>girl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>give her the same name,</v>

2053
01:48:24.550 --> 01:48:26.660
<v Speaker 3>but also tell them about her needy </v>
<v Speaker 3>little brother,</v>

2054
01:48:26.840 --> 01:48:30.770
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who has the same need and their response</v>

2055
01:48:30.771 --> 01:48:31.940
<v Speaker 3>diminishes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2056
01:48:31.941 --> 01:48:35.990
<v Speaker 3>That just the addition of a single </v>
<v Speaker 3>person diminishes the response.</v>

2057
01:48:35.990 --> 01:48:40.990
<v Speaker 3>And this is just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a moral fallacy that we're all </v>

2058
01:48:40.990 --> 01:48:41.690
<v Speaker 3>living out every day because if you care</v>
<v Speaker 3>about this one little girl,</v>

2059
01:48:41.930 --> 01:48:45.170
<v Speaker 3>you should care at least as much about </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fate of her and her brother.</v>

2060
01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:47.070
<v Speaker 3>And when you ask statistic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2061
01:48:47.480 --> 01:48:51.610
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't because this is a man.</v>

2062
01:48:51.670 --> 01:48:53.730
<v Speaker 3>You'll exhaust yourself in the attempt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2063
01:48:53.731 --> 01:48:58.731
<v Speaker 3>because we need.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you wanting to know for 100 </v>

2064
01:48:58.731 --> 01:48:58.940
<v Speaker 3>people?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what this,</v>

2065
01:48:59.070 --> 01:49:04.070
<v Speaker 3>this is what this software flog gets us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gets us people who will watch four </v>

2066
01:49:04.770 --> 01:49:06.290
<v Speaker 3>hours a day with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

2067
01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:11.320
<v Speaker 3>with effortless and and Peter Tear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stained compassion,</v>

2068
01:49:12.240 --> 01:49:16.350
<v Speaker 3>the saga of the little girl who fell </v>
<v Speaker 3>down the well,</v>

2069
01:49:16.770 --> 01:49:21.770
<v Speaker 3>but who will blindly turn the channel </v>
<v Speaker 3>when they're hearing about a genocide </v>

2070
01:49:21.770 --> 01:49:24.150
<v Speaker 3>that is raging and there's a thousands </v>
<v Speaker 3>have already died.</v>

2071
01:49:24.550 --> 01:49:26.490
<v Speaker 3>Listen guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have something,</v>

2072
01:49:26.491 --> 01:49:31.491
<v Speaker 3>we have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you for this know I'm not talking </v>

2073
01:49:31.491 --> 01:49:31.960
<v Speaker 3>about you're misunderstood.</v>

2074
01:49:31.960 --> 01:49:33.880
<v Speaker 3>You're misunderstanding me to great </v>
<v Speaker 3>effect here.</v>

2075
01:49:34.090 --> 01:49:39.090
<v Speaker 3>That if I'm not saying that you should </v>
<v Speaker 3>personally be overwhelmed by the death </v>

2076
01:49:40.001 --> 01:49:45.001
<v Speaker 3>toll every day you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that it's functional for </v>

2077
01:49:45.001 --> 01:49:47.791
<v Speaker 3>you and I to each personally get up each</v>
<v Speaker 3>morning and just drink deep of the full </v>

2078
01:49:48.821 --> 01:49:50.830
<v Speaker 3>horror of all the bad luck that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>spread.</v>

2079
01:49:50.860 --> 01:49:51.700
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it is,</v>

2080
01:49:51.701 --> 01:49:55.030
<v Speaker 3>but maybe we can't have that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as societies we need.</v>

2081
01:49:55.330 --> 01:49:58.690
<v Speaker 3>When you're talking about how we report,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how we spend our money,</v>

2082
01:49:58.960 --> 01:50:03.960
<v Speaker 3>how we get a portion foreign aid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the kinds of wars we fight or don't </v>

2083
01:50:03.960 --> 01:50:03.970
<v Speaker 3>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it had to interpret.</v>

2084
01:50:04.300 --> 01:50:07.990
<v Speaker 3>Then we have to correct for what is in </v>
<v Speaker 3>fact a moral illusion,</v>

2085
01:50:07.991 --> 01:50:10.510
<v Speaker 3>which is we know that if we tell one </v>
<v Speaker 3>little,</v>

2086
01:50:10.980 --> 01:50:14.650
<v Speaker 3>we tell one compelling story about a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little girl,</v>

2087
01:50:14.740 --> 01:50:17.020
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We could go to war over that.</v>

2088
01:50:17.080 --> 01:50:22.080
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas we won't be motivated by a </v>

2089
01:50:22.080 --> 01:50:22.080
<v Speaker 3>genocide.</v>

2090
01:50:22.080 --> 01:50:23.080
<v Speaker 3>That's the kind of thing that moves </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole societies now and if,</v>

2091
01:50:23.081 --> 01:50:23.520
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's.</v>

2092
01:50:23.530 --> 01:50:26.110
<v Speaker 3>If you add to it the bogus religious </v>
<v Speaker 3>sanctity,</v>

2093
01:50:26.111 --> 01:50:26.920
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

2094
01:50:26.921 --> 01:50:27.440
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

2095
01:50:27.450 --> 01:50:30.160
<v Speaker 3>if we burn the Koran on this stage </v>
<v Speaker 3>tonight,</v>

2096
01:50:30.550 --> 01:50:31.950
<v Speaker 3>the rest of our.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2097
01:50:32.260 --> 01:50:35.200
<v Speaker 3>the rest of our lives would be spent in </v>
<v Speaker 3>hiding,</v>

2098
01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:38.500
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because of how motivated people would be</v>

2099
01:50:38.660 --> 01:50:39.080
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

2100
01:50:39.250 --> 01:50:41.890
<v Speaker 3>to address that pseudo problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2101
01:50:42.130 --> 01:50:47.130
<v Speaker 3>That's the world we're living in and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're at civilization so far as we have </v>

2102
01:50:47.130 --> 01:50:51.541
<v Speaker 3>a purchase on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is a matter of correcting for those </v>

2103
01:50:51.541 --> 01:50:53.560
<v Speaker 3>errors and religion for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not across the board,</v>

2104
01:50:53.561 --> 01:50:56.920
<v Speaker 3>but for the most part is standing in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>way of those course corrections.</v>

2105
01:51:00.900 --> 01:51:04.920
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

2106
01:51:04.950 --> 01:51:05.490
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

2107
01:51:05.760 --> 01:51:08.610
<v Speaker 4>There was a tremendous amount to unpack </v>
<v Speaker 4>in that.</v>

2108
01:51:08.640 --> 01:51:11.250
<v Speaker 4>I mean and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and like in some sense,</v>

2109
01:51:11.251 --> 01:51:12.510
<v Speaker 4>a surprising amount.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2110
01:51:13.080 --> 01:51:14.850
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have,</v>

2111
01:51:15.050 --> 01:51:20.050
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're wired to feel intense empathy for </v>

2112
01:51:20.050 --> 01:51:24.141
<v Speaker 4>individuals who are close to us and we </v>
<v Speaker 4>can be told stories in a manner that </v>

2113
01:51:25.310 --> 01:51:30.310
<v Speaker 4>that makes that system manifest itself </v>
<v Speaker 4>and everyone and their dog thinks that </v>

2114
01:51:30.310 --> 01:51:32.040
<v Speaker 4>that's a wonderful thing and we call </v>
<v Speaker 4>that empathy,</v>

2115
01:51:32.090 --> 01:51:37.090
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and empathy has a narrow domain of </v>

2116
01:51:37.090 --> 01:51:37.210
<v Speaker 4>utility as it turns out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because how?</v>

2117
01:51:37.240 --> 01:51:40.290
<v Speaker 4>I mean maybe if you were all who you </v>
<v Speaker 4>should be,</v>

2118
01:51:40.320 --> 01:51:45.320
<v Speaker 4>you'd be weeping constantly for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>catastrophic fate of sentient beings on </v>

2119
01:51:45.320 --> 01:51:45.660
<v Speaker 4>the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can't handle it.</v>

2120
01:51:45.720 --> 01:51:48.090
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's that you can barely handle your own</v>

2121
01:51:48.091 --> 01:51:52.080
<v Speaker 4>suffering and maybe you can handle a bit</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the suffering of your family and more</v>

2122
01:51:52.081 --> 01:51:57.081
<v Speaker 4>power to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you could rectify that and if you </v>

2123
01:51:57.081 --> 01:51:57.090
<v Speaker 4>were better human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe you could expand that outwards,</v>

2124
01:51:57.360 --> 01:52:02.360
<v Speaker 4>but the fact that our empathy doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>scale up to the level of genocide with </v>

2125
01:52:02.360 --> 01:52:04.730
<v Speaker 4>the same intensity that we treat </v>
<v Speaker 4>instances of individuals,</v>

2126
01:52:04.731 --> 01:52:07.020
<v Speaker 4>suffering isn't an indication that we're</v>
<v Speaker 4>irrational.</v>

2127
01:52:07.350 --> 01:52:09.120
<v Speaker 4>It's just an indication that we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>limited.</v>

2128
01:52:11.890 --> 01:52:14.090
<v Speaker 3>I think this is an indication of exactly</v>

2129
01:52:14.840 --> 01:52:15.620
<v Speaker 2>the problem</v>

2130
01:52:15.650 --> 01:52:20.650
<v Speaker 1>of our evolved structure is not matching</v>
<v Speaker 1>the present because the point is match </v>

2131
01:52:20.780 --> 01:52:22.400
<v Speaker 1>because we take care of our families </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

2132
01:52:22.401 --> 01:52:27.401
<v Speaker 1>but they don't match because if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>encountered the starving girl that's </v>

2133
01:52:27.401 --> 01:52:32.101
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a crude measure of suffering in </v>

2134
01:52:32.101 --> 01:52:36.611
<v Speaker 1>your local environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were you in the past now that you can </v>

2135
01:52:36.611 --> 01:52:39.821
<v Speaker 1>encounter this girl on the television?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not clear what it should mean to </v>

2136
01:52:39.821 --> 01:52:39.821
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2137
01:52:39.821 --> 01:52:44.260
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't calibrate how many your act </v>

2138
01:52:44.260 --> 01:52:44.260
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

2139
01:52:44.260 --> 01:52:46.460
<v Speaker 1>and so the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the point is your indifference</v>

2140
01:52:46.460 --> 01:52:48.980
<v Speaker 5>to a genocide,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is an abstraction,</v>

2141
01:52:49.420 --> 01:52:51.800
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is altered.</v>

2142
01:52:51.830 --> 01:52:55.370
<v Speaker 5>Should you see pictures of the bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

2143
01:52:55.550 --> 01:53:00.550
<v Speaker 5>you shouldn't actually feel differently </v>
<v Speaker 5>about the genocide in the abstract case </v>

2144
01:53:00.550 --> 01:53:04.421
<v Speaker 5>versus the the case that you're looking </v>
<v Speaker 5>at the bodies and the fact that we have </v>

2145
01:53:04.421 --> 01:53:07.430
<v Speaker 5>access to photo realistic </v>
<v Speaker 5>representations breading.</v>

2146
01:53:08.410 --> 01:53:13.410
<v Speaker 3>Of course that was actually a rational </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I can show you the case where </v>

2147
01:53:13.410 --> 01:53:18.020
<v Speaker 3>you care at level 10 about the little </v>
<v Speaker 3>girl named Lila and you care at level </v>

2148
01:53:20.220 --> 01:53:25.220
<v Speaker 3>eight about the little girl named Layla </v>
<v Speaker 3>and her brother named Jaunty.</v>

2149
01:53:25.830 --> 01:53:28.980
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you care at level four if I've added</v>

2150
01:53:28.981 --> 01:53:33.981
<v Speaker 3>a few more kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the little girl named Lila who you </v>

2151
01:53:33.981 --> 01:53:35.820
<v Speaker 3>was ostensibly care about is there and </v>
<v Speaker 3>each one of these,</v>

2152
01:53:36.090 --> 01:53:38.000
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so nurses are diminished,</v>

2153
01:53:38.040 --> 01:53:40.740
<v Speaker 3>diminished nobody beautification of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sufferer.</v>

2154
01:53:40.741 --> 01:53:45.741
<v Speaker 3>You have $10 to give away every month to</v>
<v Speaker 3>help start struggling in humanity and </v>

2155
01:53:45.741 --> 01:53:48.300
<v Speaker 3>you tell me you'll give 10 to lila this </v>
<v Speaker 3>month and I,</v>

2156
01:53:48.450 --> 01:53:50.580
<v Speaker 3>and then I catch you in another moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I say,</v>

2157
01:53:50.581 --> 01:53:51.750
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2158
01:53:52.110 --> 01:53:54.180
<v Speaker 3>it's Leila and her brother.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>

2159
01:53:54.181 --> 01:53:56.790
<v Speaker 3>if you only can give 10,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand,</v>

2160
01:53:56.791 --> 01:54:00.000
<v Speaker 3>but you know the problem is actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>worse than I suspected.</v>

2161
01:54:00.210 --> 01:54:05.210
<v Speaker 3>And you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well actually album's going to give </v>

2162
01:54:05.210 --> 01:54:05.210
<v Speaker 3>eight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2163
01:54:05.210 --> 01:54:06.510
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not coherent with your how much you</v>

2164
01:54:06.690 --> 01:54:08.220
<v Speaker 3>cared about Leila and the first place</v>

2165
01:54:08.280 --> 01:54:13.280
<v Speaker 5>we do know we do know quite well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The risks that we use to orient </v>

2166
01:54:13.280 --> 01:54:17.000
<v Speaker 5>ourselves in the world can be placed </v>
<v Speaker 5>into frameworks where they produce </v>

2167
01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.761
<v Speaker 5>contradictory outcomes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that doesn't mean that the </v>

2168
01:54:19.761 --> 01:54:22.161
<v Speaker 5>heuristics themselves are deeply flawed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's that it's a problem with the work </v>

2169
01:54:22.161 --> 01:54:22.161
<v Speaker 5>of people like condiment and diversity</v>

2170
01:54:22.161 --> 01:54:25.840
<v Speaker 3>is that we need to correct for that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>need to correct for them because they're</v>

2171
01:54:26.220 --> 01:54:31.220
<v Speaker 3>producing reliable results that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>recognize that you can put them in a </v>

2172
01:54:31.220 --> 01:54:31.220
<v Speaker 3>situation where they</v>

2173
01:54:31.220 --> 01:54:35.990
<v Speaker 5>produce a counterproductive response,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that doesn't mean that generally </v>

2174
01:54:35.990 --> 01:54:38.811
<v Speaker 5>speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in most situations they don't produce a </v>

2175
01:54:38.811 --> 01:54:40.821
<v Speaker 5>useful outcome because the question is </v>
<v Speaker 5>why in the hell would they evolved if </v>

2176
01:54:40.821 --> 01:54:40.821
<v Speaker 5>they didn't?</v>

2177
01:54:40.821 --> 01:54:45.780
<v Speaker 3>Most of the time evolved to live with </v>
<v Speaker 3>150 people with whom we're related and </v>

2178
01:54:45.911 --> 01:54:49.870
<v Speaker 3>to be terrified of the people in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>next valley who may want to kill and eat</v>

2179
01:54:49.871 --> 01:54:50.660
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

2180
01:54:50.670 --> 01:54:51.370
<v Speaker 3>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2181
01:54:51.371 --> 01:54:56.371
<v Speaker 3>that's our ancient circumstance which </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't map onto a common humanity of 7 </v>

2182
01:54:56.371 --> 01:55:01.350
<v Speaker 3>billion people trying to figure out how </v>
<v Speaker 3>to get to Mars without killing each </v>

2183
01:55:01.350 --> 01:55:01.350
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2184
01:55:01.350 --> 01:55:04.120
<v Speaker 3>it does map onto it sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unfortunately,</v>

2185
01:55:04.121 --> 01:55:07.170
<v Speaker 3>because there are many times when we </v>
<v Speaker 3>still face the same kind of effect,</v>

2186
01:55:07.360 --> 01:55:08.570
<v Speaker 3>but hence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at maps.</v>

2187
01:55:08.571 --> 01:55:13.571
<v Speaker 3>Sean does the hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't be concerned about the </v>

2188
01:55:13.571 --> 01:55:16.510
<v Speaker 3>fundamentalists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>terror of Islam if you weren't driven by</v>

2189
01:55:16.511 --> 01:55:20.520
<v Speaker 3>those essentially tribal considerations </v>
<v Speaker 3>suggesting not trauma.</v>

2190
01:55:20.550 --> 01:55:25.550
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't require if my a mere </v>
<v Speaker 3>identification with humanity,</v>

2191
01:55:26.260 --> 01:55:31.260
<v Speaker 3>it can ground not wanting to be murdered</v>
<v Speaker 3>by people who are identified with a </v>

2192
01:55:31.260 --> 01:55:32.550
<v Speaker 3>subset of humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2193
01:55:32.560 --> 01:55:37.560
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't need to be part of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>smaller tribe to care that people will </v>

2194
01:55:37.560 --> 01:55:39.940
<v Speaker 3>murder me over burning the Koran.</v>

2195
01:55:40.210 --> 01:55:40.660
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2196
01:55:40.661 --> 01:55:41.260
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

2197
01:55:41.320 --> 01:55:46.320
<v Speaker 3>it's clearly counterproductive that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>live in a society where some objects are</v>

2198
01:55:47.250 --> 01:55:51.060
<v Speaker 3>held with such totemic attachment for </v>
<v Speaker 3>irrational reasons,</v>

2199
01:55:51.061 --> 01:55:54.830
<v Speaker 3>by many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many millions of people were,</v>

2200
01:55:54.910 --> 01:55:57.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should be sympathetic with this.</v>

2201
01:55:57.291 --> 01:55:59.850
<v Speaker 3>Our free speech is actually canceled on </v>
<v Speaker 3>this point,</v>

2202
01:56:00.010 --> 01:56:02.640
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We literally can't produce cartoons.</v>

2203
01:56:02.760 --> 01:56:06.000
<v Speaker 3>I have scholarly words about the cartoon</v>
<v Speaker 3>price if we don't show the cartoon,</v>

2204
01:56:06.210 --> 01:56:11.210
<v Speaker 3>no argument whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if we miss about the lack of utility </v>

2205
01:56:11.210 --> 01:56:12.320
<v Speaker 3>of you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to be identified as a,</v>

2206
01:56:12.690 --> 01:56:16.380
<v Speaker 3>as a Christian or a Jew to push back </v>
<v Speaker 3>against that.</v>

2207
01:56:16.410 --> 01:56:21.410
<v Speaker 3>You just have to be a human being that </v>
<v Speaker 3>sees the dysfunction of a smaller kind </v>

2208
01:56:21.811 --> 01:56:22.710
<v Speaker 3>of provincialism.</v>

2209
01:56:23.480 --> 01:56:28.480
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the thing that I'm struggling with is </v>

2210
01:56:28.480 --> 01:56:28.540
<v Speaker 5>that I still can't understand in what </v>
<v Speaker 5>your ethos is,</v>

2211
01:56:28.630 --> 01:56:33.440
<v Speaker 5>is is grounded because you claim like a </v>
<v Speaker 5>transcendental rationalism,</v>

2212
01:56:33.441 --> 01:56:35.690
<v Speaker 5>but you won't identify the structures </v>
<v Speaker 5>that produce it.</v>

2213
01:56:35.691 --> 01:56:40.691
<v Speaker 5>It's a black box and when I tried to </v>
<v Speaker 5>push you on the absolute nature of your </v>

2214
01:56:40.691 --> 01:56:42.530
<v Speaker 5>ethical claim,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is that the bad life is worse than</v>

2215
01:56:42.531 --> 01:56:46.450
<v Speaker 5>the good life and that we should in fact</v>
<v Speaker 5>university work towards the good life.</v>

2216
01:56:46.790 --> 01:56:51.790
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't seem to me that you'll accept</v>
<v Speaker 5>the proposition that that's a universal </v>

2217
01:56:51.790 --> 01:56:51.790
<v Speaker 5>claim.</v>

2218
01:56:51.790 --> 01:56:51.790
<v Speaker 3>It.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2219
01:56:51.790 --> 01:56:51.790
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

2220
01:56:51.790 --> 01:56:53.700
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should is irrelevant here.</v>

2221
01:56:53.701 --> 01:56:58.620
<v Speaker 3>It's just the fact that there is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibility of moving in this space.</v>

2222
01:56:58.621 --> 01:57:02.970
<v Speaker 3>If you move in the wrong direction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you move far enough,</v>

2223
01:57:03.360 --> 01:57:06.590
<v Speaker 3>you'll like it less and less,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but why is it relevant?</v>

2224
01:57:06.660 --> 01:57:09.390
<v Speaker 3>Give given the given the mines you have.</v>

2225
01:57:09.890 --> 01:57:14.890
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what if you had to accept moving in the </v>

2226
01:57:14.890 --> 01:57:18.931
<v Speaker 5>wrong direction and experiencing less </v>
<v Speaker 5>and less wellbeing in order to get to a </v>

2227
01:57:18.931 --> 01:57:19.220
<v Speaker 5>better place it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2228
01:57:19.221 --> 01:57:21.550
<v Speaker 5>and maybe even just to survive,</v>
<v Speaker 5>suppose the,</v>

2229
01:57:21.600 --> 01:57:26.600
<v Speaker 5>suppose the population has to endure a </v>
<v Speaker 5>generation and a half of misery in order</v>

2230
01:57:27.251 --> 01:57:28.060
<v Speaker 5>to persist</v>

2231
01:57:28.550 --> 01:57:33.550
<v Speaker 3>ethically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a perfectly intelligible </v>

2232
01:57:33.550 --> 01:57:35.891
<v Speaker 3>circumstance that people have had to </v>
<v Speaker 3>face and it's in my,</v>

2233
01:57:37.941 --> 01:57:42.941
<v Speaker 3>on my moral landscape,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's analogous to what we were were we </v>

2234
01:57:42.941 --> 01:57:45.000
<v Speaker 3>might be at one local maximum or some </v>
<v Speaker 3>high point,</v>

2235
01:57:45.860 --> 01:57:50.420
<v Speaker 3>but we're moving in a down a slope to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get to yet some higher place.</v>

2236
01:57:50.421 --> 01:57:51.230
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So certain things,</v>

2237
01:57:51.740 --> 01:57:56.740
<v Speaker 3>some things may only be possible if we </v>
<v Speaker 3>made some painful and net unpleasant </v>

2238
01:57:57.651 --> 01:58:00.140
<v Speaker 3>sacrifice for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2239
01:58:00.260 --> 01:58:01.050
<v Speaker 3>And so that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's,</v>

2240
01:58:01.100 --> 01:58:04.400
<v Speaker 3>that can be rationally apprehended.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There can be an argument for that.</v>

2241
01:58:04.580 --> 01:58:05.490
<v Speaker 3>It could be a way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2242
01:58:05.491 --> 01:58:06.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we all have to go on a diet,</v>

2243
01:58:07.220 --> 01:58:10.880
<v Speaker 3>otherwise we're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to die of this problem,</v>

2244
01:58:10.881 --> 01:58:15.881
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We all have to stop eating whatever it </v>

2245
01:58:15.881 --> 01:58:15.881
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wheat,</v>

2246
01:58:15.881 --> 01:58:16.100
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a hard sacrifice for.</v>

2247
01:58:16.101 --> 01:58:18.870
<v Speaker 3>People will have to stop it as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2248
01:58:19.670 --> 01:58:22.610
<v Speaker 3>if that were just true wealth and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there'd be an argument for it,</v>

2249
01:58:22.611 --> 01:58:24.710
<v Speaker 3>there'd be evidence that would convince </v>
<v Speaker 3>us we would stop,</v>

2250
01:58:24.740 --> 01:58:29.740
<v Speaker 3>we would feel the pain and we would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we would get whatever benefit with that </v>

2251
01:58:29.740 --> 01:58:29.740
<v Speaker 3>was on the other side of that sacrifice.</v>

2252
01:58:29.750 --> 01:58:31.310
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to,</v>

2253
01:58:31.640 --> 01:58:35.380
<v Speaker 3>if the utility again to come bring it </v>
<v Speaker 3>back to stories at which is,</v>

2254
01:58:35.570 --> 01:58:36.920
<v Speaker 3>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not my emphasis,</v>

2255
01:58:36.921 --> 01:58:38.930
<v Speaker 3>but it is yours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

2256
01:58:38.990 --> 01:58:43.300
<v Speaker 3>the utility of stories is not something </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm arguing against.</v>

2257
01:58:43.360 --> 01:58:46.630
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's no question that certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>stories are incredibly compelling.</v>

2258
01:58:46.660 --> 01:58:49.180
<v Speaker 3>And in our conversation with one </v>
<v Speaker 3>another,</v>

2259
01:58:49.450 --> 01:58:52.450
<v Speaker 3>the moment you begin to frame something </v>
<v Speaker 3>in terms of a story,</v>

2260
01:58:52.900 --> 01:58:55.420
<v Speaker 3>people become much more interested right</v>
<v Speaker 3>now if,</v>

2261
01:58:55.490 --> 01:59:00.490
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if 90 percent of what we said together </v>

2262
01:59:00.490 --> 01:59:01.900
<v Speaker 3>tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're afraid each,</v>

2263
01:59:01.960 --> 01:59:04.700
<v Speaker 3>each point we were making as a matter of</v>
<v Speaker 3>philosophy or,</v>

2264
01:59:04.890 --> 01:59:09.520
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or science were framed in will.</v>

2265
01:59:09.521 --> 01:59:09.970
<v Speaker 3>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2266
01:59:09.971 --> 01:59:12.640
<v Speaker 3>yesterday I was walking down the street </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I met this guy,</v>

2267
01:59:12.660 --> 01:59:17.660
<v Speaker 3>the terrifying looking guy and all of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sudden people become much more </v>

2268
01:59:17.660 --> 01:59:17.660
<v Speaker 3>interested.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2269
01:59:17.660 --> 01:59:22.291
<v Speaker 3>And then that's not an accident and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>says something deep about us that we </v>

2270
01:59:22.291 --> 01:59:26.911
<v Speaker 3>could understand that in evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 3>terms and we might in fact one to </v>

2271
01:59:26.911 --> 01:59:29.890
<v Speaker 3>creatively leverage to be better people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to have better conversations.</v>

2272
01:59:29.920 --> 01:59:30.970
<v Speaker 3>Definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

2273
01:59:31.370 --> 01:59:33.160
<v Speaker 3>So that's what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing.</v>

2274
01:59:33.220 --> 01:59:38.220
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing that I say in opposition</v>
<v Speaker 3>to religious dogmatism and religious </v>

2275
01:59:38.921 --> 01:59:43.921
<v Speaker 3>sectarianism that discounts that reality</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's a psychological reality is a </v>

2276
01:59:44.201 --> 01:59:49.201
<v Speaker 3>cultural reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not against making the most of </v>

2277
01:59:49.201 --> 01:59:49.201
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>

2278
01:59:49.201 --> 01:59:50.320
<v Speaker 3>my basic claim,</v>
<v Speaker 3>however,</v>

2279
01:59:50.321 --> 01:59:55.321
<v Speaker 3>is that we never need to believe that </v>
<v Speaker 3>one of our books may not have a human </v>

2280
01:59:56.261 --> 01:59:58.390
<v Speaker 3>origin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In order to do that effectively,</v>

2281
01:59:58.630 --> 02:00:03.630
<v Speaker 3>you can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can be just as compelled by the </v>

2282
02:00:03.630 --> 02:00:06.241
<v Speaker 3>example of somebody like Jesus or some </v>
<v Speaker 3>more modern person who strikes you as a </v>

2283
02:00:08.261 --> 02:00:13.261
<v Speaker 3>moral hero and a deeply wise without </v>
<v Speaker 3>believing anything on insufficient </v>

2284
02:00:13.901 --> 02:00:14.770
<v Speaker 3>evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if,</v>

2285
02:00:16.240 --> 02:00:18.730
<v Speaker 3>as I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you alluded to,</v>

2286
02:00:19.060 --> 02:00:24.040
<v Speaker 3>purely fictional stories about </v>
<v Speaker 3>superheros can have immense effect on us</v>

2287
02:00:24.190 --> 02:00:26.800
<v Speaker 3>and that's something we could understand</v>
<v Speaker 3>and also leverage.</v>

2288
02:00:27.070 --> 02:00:32.070
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that takes us out of the religion </v>

2289
02:00:32.070 --> 02:00:32.070
<v Speaker 3>business and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's all I've been arguing for.</v>

2290
02:00:32.070 --> 02:00:33.100
<v Speaker 3>So do you really believe</v>

2291
02:00:33.390 --> 02:00:33.780
<v Speaker 2>that's</v>

2292
02:00:37.530 --> 02:00:40.830
<v Speaker 1>the belief in the supernatural aspect of</v>
<v Speaker 1>these stories,</v>

2293
02:00:40.890 --> 02:00:44.730
<v Speaker 1>never alters the calculus of what people</v>
<v Speaker 1>should do,</v>

2294
02:00:45.480 --> 02:00:50.480
<v Speaker 1>that the divine nature of a story about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus doesn't motivate people to do </v>

2295
02:00:50.480 --> 02:00:51.750
<v Speaker 1>something that they might not have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>courage to do otherwise.</v>

2296
02:00:51.751 --> 02:00:56.751
<v Speaker 1>The belief that they might end up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>heaven because their good work is going </v>

2297
02:00:56.751 --> 02:00:57.480
<v Speaker 1>to be observed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't alter their behavior.</v>

2298
02:00:57.580 --> 02:00:57.940
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2299
02:00:57.941 --> 02:01:01.850
<v Speaker 3>I know it alters their behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but rather often for the bad.</v>

2300
02:01:01.960 --> 02:01:06.960
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is why this is what worries </v>

2301
02:01:06.960 --> 02:01:06.960
<v Speaker 3>me about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

2302
02:01:06.960 --> 02:01:10.170
<v Speaker 3>I think there's something there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a profound net negative that we </v>

2303
02:01:10.301 --> 02:01:15.301
<v Speaker 3>are paying the price for everyday by </v>
<v Speaker 3>believing in paradise,</v>

2304
02:01:16.720 --> 02:01:17.380
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The belief,</v>

2305
02:01:17.400 --> 02:01:22.400
<v Speaker 3>a belief that this life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it probably doesn't matter very much at </v>

2306
02:01:22.400 --> 02:01:27.031
<v Speaker 3>all because we get what we really want </v>
<v Speaker 3>after we die is forget about the </v>

2307
02:01:28.241 --> 02:01:31.330
<v Speaker 3>evidentiary basis for that belief.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

2308
02:01:31.380 --> 02:01:36.130
<v Speaker 3>It's ruinous for prioritizing what we </v>
<v Speaker 3>should be prioritizing in this life.</v>

2309
02:01:36.190 --> 02:01:37.720
<v Speaker 3>And if I agree with that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way.</v>

2310
02:01:37.721 --> 02:01:38.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2311
02:01:38.591 --> 02:01:39.230
<v Speaker 3>Well that's interesting.</v>

2312
02:01:42.840 --> 02:01:47.840
<v Speaker 1>So let me ask you this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hear from you what might be a kind of </v>

2313
02:01:49.461 --> 02:01:52.490
<v Speaker 1>confirmation bias where I hear that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2314
02:01:52.491 --> 02:01:56.150
<v Speaker 1>we've got a mixed bag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got supernatural claims,</v>

2315
02:01:56.151 --> 02:02:01.151
<v Speaker 1>these supernatural claims,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all agree have effects on the way </v>

2316
02:02:01.151 --> 02:02:04.391
<v Speaker 1>people actually behave and you're quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>focused on the negative and you tend to </v>

2317
02:02:04.851 --> 02:02:09.851
<v Speaker 1>discount the positive which might be an </v>
<v Speaker 1>artifact of the fact that we're talking </v>

2318
02:02:09.851 --> 02:02:14.081
<v Speaker 1>about the present and therefore maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's not well matched to </v>

2319
02:02:14.081 --> 02:02:18.011
<v Speaker 1>these stories or it might be from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that you have the sense that there </v>

2320
02:02:18.011 --> 02:02:22.091
<v Speaker 1>is actually a bias that these belief </v>
<v Speaker 1>structures do and have always produced </v>

2321
02:02:22.790 --> 02:02:25.040
<v Speaker 1>more harm than good.</v>

2322
02:02:25.460 --> 02:02:30.320
<v Speaker 3>And also my sense that the positive can </v>
<v Speaker 3>be had without those structures.</v>

2323
02:02:30.740 --> 02:02:32.170
<v Speaker 3>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're talking about the,</v>

2324
02:02:32.171 --> 02:02:33.380
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2325
02:02:33.490 --> 02:02:38.490
<v Speaker 3>the contemplative experience like is it </v>
<v Speaker 3>possible to feed the wake up tomorrow </v>

2326
02:02:38.490 --> 02:02:42.491
<v Speaker 3>morning feeling like my heart right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Feeling like you're just inseparable </v>

2327
02:02:43.461 --> 02:02:47.990
<v Speaker 3>from the pure capital b being that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness,</v>

2328
02:02:48.350 --> 02:02:50.540
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's no separate self,</v>

2329
02:02:50.590 --> 02:02:55.590
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the self transcending union with </v>

2330
02:02:55.590 --> 02:02:56.120
<v Speaker 3>everything you can proceed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2331
02:02:56.210 --> 02:03:01.210
<v Speaker 3>I think that can be had without any kind</v>
<v Speaker 3>of religious dogmatism masters that </v>

2332
02:03:01.210 --> 02:03:02.300
<v Speaker 3>matter of paying close enough attention </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the nature of consciousness,</v>

2333
02:03:02.301 --> 02:03:05.660
<v Speaker 3>so the contemplative life is the bay is </v>
<v Speaker 3>one baby in the bathwater.</v>

2334
02:03:05.690 --> 02:03:08.840
<v Speaker 3>We can save the ethical life is another </v>
<v Speaker 3>baby.</v>

2335
02:03:08.870 --> 02:03:13.870
<v Speaker 3>We can say if you don't have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>presuppose anything on insufficient </v>

2336
02:03:13.870 --> 02:03:17.171
<v Speaker 3>evidence to argue about what is right </v>
<v Speaker 3>and wrong and good and evil in in the </v>

2337
02:03:17.171 --> 02:03:17.240
<v Speaker 3>21st century.</v>

2338
02:03:17.730 --> 02:03:22.730
<v Speaker 1>Is it fair to call that a hypothesis </v>
<v Speaker 1>that not just for some people but for </v>

2339
02:03:22.730 --> 02:03:27.561
<v Speaker 1>everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The level of wellbeing can be enhanced </v>

2340
02:03:27.561 --> 02:03:31.530
<v Speaker 1>through rational interaction with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions that dictate what we do.</v>

2341
02:03:32.420 --> 02:03:33.960
<v Speaker 1>Is that a hypothesis?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

2342
02:03:34.380 --> 02:03:39.380
<v Speaker 3>That's a hypothesis that the one </v>
<v Speaker 3>additional fact that we that makes that </v>

2343
02:03:40.590 --> 02:03:43.800
<v Speaker 3>more or less mood is that on certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>points,</v>

2344
02:03:44.610 --> 02:03:49.610
<v Speaker 3>even if we felt that really believe in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fiction were what was it was </v>

2345
02:03:51.481 --> 02:03:56.481
<v Speaker 3>advantageous to people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Depending on which fiction you're </v>

2346
02:03:56.481 --> 02:03:56.481
<v Speaker 3>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's simply just.</v>

2347
02:03:56.481 --> 02:03:58.770
<v Speaker 3>There's too much evidence against it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't.</v>

2348
02:03:58.771 --> 02:04:03.771
<v Speaker 3>You can't decide to believe something </v>
<v Speaker 3>for which you have no evidence simply </v>

2349
02:04:04.831 --> 02:04:06.850
<v Speaker 3>because of the good effects.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The good,</v>

2350
02:04:06.860 --> 02:04:11.860
<v Speaker 3>the good experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It will give you or you imagine it will </v>

2351
02:04:11.860 --> 02:04:11.860
<v Speaker 3>give you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2352
02:04:11.860 --> 02:04:12.690
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why Pascal's wager never made any</v>

2353
02:04:12.691 --> 02:04:17.691
<v Speaker 3>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can't say the only way you can </v>

2354
02:04:17.691 --> 02:04:17.910
<v Speaker 3>believe something to be true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really true,</v>

2355
02:04:17.940 --> 02:04:22.940
<v Speaker 3>not just metaphorically true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is to believe that if it weren't true,</v>

2356
02:04:23.730 --> 02:04:28.730
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They you stand at some relationship to </v>

2357
02:04:28.730 --> 02:04:30.300
<v Speaker 3>its truth such that that is the reason </v>
<v Speaker 3>why you believe it.</v>

2358
02:04:30.330 --> 02:04:32.580
<v Speaker 3>Now you can't say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't be telling yourself,</v>

2359
02:04:32.790 --> 02:04:34.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no evidence for this thing,</v>

2360
02:04:34.381 --> 02:04:37.650
<v Speaker 3>but I know life would be better if I </v>
<v Speaker 3>believed that to true,</v>

2361
02:04:37.710 --> 02:04:39.660
<v Speaker 3>and so therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really believe it's true.</v>

2362
02:04:39.810 --> 02:04:41.130
<v Speaker 3>You don't think people do that all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time?</v>

2363
02:04:41.190 --> 02:04:46.190
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they do things much more like </v>

2364
02:04:46.190 --> 02:04:46.950
<v Speaker 3>we're talking the metaphorical truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about you.</v>

2365
02:04:46.951 --> 02:04:51.951
<v Speaker 3>We act as if things are true without </v>
<v Speaker 3>forming any strong propositional claim </v>

2366
02:04:53.130 --> 02:04:54.640
<v Speaker 3>and that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fine.</v>

2367
02:04:54.830 --> 02:04:57.590
<v Speaker 3>That has its own utility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't think this is</v>

2368
02:04:57.700 --> 02:04:58.600
<v Speaker 1>basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2369
02:04:58.660 --> 02:05:03.660
<v Speaker 1>we all suspend disbelief when we go and </v>
<v Speaker 1>watch a movie and we sort of entitled a </v>

2370
02:05:03.671 --> 02:05:07.420
<v Speaker 1>movie maker to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to set the ground rules of the space and</v>

2371
02:05:07.421 --> 02:05:10.240
<v Speaker 1>if it's Harry Potter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than there are magic magical things that</v>

2372
02:05:10.241 --> 02:05:12.340
<v Speaker 1>can happen and if it's some other story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe there aren't.</v>

2373
02:05:12.580 --> 02:05:17.580
<v Speaker 1>So we all have a mechanism whereby we </v>
<v Speaker 1>know we can suspend disbelief and it's </v>

2374
02:05:17.831 --> 02:05:22.831
<v Speaker 1>interesting to me that you seem not to </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine that people are doing that with </v>

2375
02:05:22.831 --> 02:05:27.481
<v Speaker 1>respect to metaphysical beliefs that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have implications for what the right </v>

2376
02:05:27.481 --> 02:05:29.680
<v Speaker 1>actions that they should take art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

2377
02:05:29.710 --> 02:05:33.520
<v Speaker 1>Why wouldn't it be the case that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>same sort of mechanism would apply?</v>

2378
02:05:34.190 --> 02:05:35.630
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it does apply,</v>

2379
02:05:35.900 --> 02:05:38.480
<v Speaker 3>but there are people who are clearly </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing much more than that.</v>

2380
02:05:39.320 --> 02:05:40.660
<v Speaker 3>So I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>

2381
02:05:40.730 --> 02:05:44.840
<v Speaker 3>if that's all people were doing under </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ages of religion,</v>

2382
02:05:45.020 --> 02:05:47.300
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't spend much time worrying </v>
<v Speaker 3>about religion,</v>

2383
02:05:47.310 --> 02:05:50.240
<v Speaker 3>but that to some degree that's what </v>
<v Speaker 3>people do.</v>

2384
02:05:50.280 --> 02:05:51.140
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you say,</v>

2385
02:05:51.170 --> 02:05:56.170
<v Speaker 3>go into caring about things that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>bought them we really shouldn't care </v>

2386
02:05:56.170 --> 02:05:59.321
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the World Cup is on right now and we </v>

2387
02:05:59.321 --> 02:06:02.980
<v Speaker 3>literally billions of people care care </v>
<v Speaker 3>down to their toes.</v>

2388
02:06:03.500 --> 02:06:07.490
<v Speaker 3>What happens to this little ball as it </v>
<v Speaker 3>traverses a lawn.</v>

2389
02:06:07.850 --> 02:06:10.670
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if it goes into the net,</v>

2390
02:06:10.760 --> 02:06:15.760
<v Speaker 3>it really matters if it fails to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it really matters and always matters if </v>

2391
02:06:15.760 --> 02:06:17.360
<v Speaker 3>we hit the target Sam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this is,</v>

2392
02:06:17.380 --> 02:06:20.120
<v Speaker 3>this is something we have manufactured </v>
<v Speaker 3>to care about,</v>

2393
02:06:20.410 --> 02:06:22.040
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It speaks to us.</v>

2394
02:06:22.330 --> 02:06:26.450
<v Speaker 3>It's quite literally a game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a game that people are playing.</v>

2395
02:06:26.450 --> 02:06:31.450
<v Speaker 3>But some people take it in taking it </v>
<v Speaker 3>further than you,</v>

2396
02:06:32.910 --> 02:06:36.290
<v Speaker 3>than,</v>
<v Speaker 3>than seems truly rational is part of the</v>

2397
02:06:36.291 --> 02:06:37.270
<v Speaker 3>fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's but,</v>

2398
02:06:37.271 --> 02:06:42.271
<v Speaker 3>but the fee that the people who can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>turn that off metaphor soccer's a </v>

2399
02:06:42.271 --> 02:06:42.880
<v Speaker 3>metaphor but there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there are people who there,</v>

2400
02:06:42.910 --> 02:06:43.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are people,</v>

2401
02:06:43.611 --> 02:06:48.611
<v Speaker 3>you know the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fullback who kicks an own goal and </v>

2402
02:06:48.611 --> 02:06:50.960
<v Speaker 3>then goes back to his South American </v>
<v Speaker 3>village and gets murdered.</v>

2403
02:06:50.990 --> 02:06:53.000
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's surrounded by people who are taking</v>

2404
02:06:53.001 --> 02:06:54.320
<v Speaker 3>the game too seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2405
02:06:54.321 --> 02:06:55.520
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

2406
02:06:55.521 --> 02:07:00.521
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so my problem with religion is that </v>

2407
02:07:00.521 --> 02:07:03.191
<v Speaker 3>so much of a time we're meeting those </v>
<v Speaker 3>people and we're at work and we're not </v>

2408
02:07:03.191 --> 02:07:07.271
<v Speaker 3>criticizing those people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have no place to stand to criticize </v>

2409
02:07:07.271 --> 02:07:07.271
<v Speaker 3>those people because</v>

2410
02:07:07.271 --> 02:07:08.950
<v Speaker 7>so attached to the game.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Fair enough.</v>

2411
02:07:10.020 --> 02:07:15.020
<v Speaker 7>Why don't we do this?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Why don't we each take three minutes to </v>

2412
02:07:15.020 --> 02:07:15.020
<v Speaker 7>sum up.</v>

2413
02:07:15.020 --> 02:07:15.020
<v Speaker 1>So I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2414
02:07:15.020 --> 02:07:16.640
<v Speaker 1>we are there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're at the end of time.</v>

2415
02:07:16.641 --> 02:07:18.500
<v Speaker 1>So why don't you each take three </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes,</v>

2416
02:07:18.590 --> 02:07:20.480
<v Speaker 1>some up and then we'll call it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

2417
02:07:20.980 --> 02:07:24.200
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure Sam went last.</v>

2418
02:07:24.201 --> 02:07:26.050
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to go first here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2419
02:07:26.830 --> 02:07:31.830
<v Speaker 3>So there's lots of things about which </v>
<v Speaker 3>seminar.</v>

2420
02:07:34.161 --> 02:07:34.870
<v Speaker 3>I agree,</v>

2421
02:07:36.370 --> 02:07:38.620
<v Speaker 4>but the devil's in the details.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course.</v>

2422
02:07:39.790 --> 02:07:44.790
<v Speaker 4>Now I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm very sympathetic to his claim that </v>

2423
02:07:44.790 --> 02:07:49.381
<v Speaker 4>we need to ground our ethical systems in</v>
<v Speaker 4>something solid and demonstrable.</v>

2424
02:07:51.370 --> 02:07:56.370
<v Speaker 4>My problem is I'm not sure how to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>that when I don't believe that you can </v>

2425
02:07:56.741 --> 02:08:01.741
<v Speaker 4>derive a value structure from your </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience of the observable facts.</v>

2426
02:08:02.950 --> 02:08:07.950
<v Speaker 4>There's too many facts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You need a structure to interpret them </v>

2427
02:08:07.950 --> 02:08:10.720
<v Speaker 4>and there isn't very much of you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so part of the reason,</v>

2428
02:08:10.810 --> 02:08:15.810
<v Speaker 4>part of the way that that's addressed </v>
<v Speaker 4>neurologically is that you have an </v>

2429
02:08:15.810 --> 02:08:18.280
<v Speaker 4>inbuilt structure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's deep,</v>

2430
02:08:18.880 --> 02:08:23.880
<v Speaker 4>it's partly biological,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's partly an emergent consequences of </v>

2431
02:08:23.880 --> 02:08:28.060
<v Speaker 4>your socialization and you view the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world of facts through that structure </v>

2432
02:08:28.060 --> 02:08:32.940
<v Speaker 4>and it's a structure of value.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now that structure of value may be </v>

2433
02:08:32.940 --> 02:08:35.620
<v Speaker 4>derived from the world of facts over the</v>
<v Speaker 4>evolutionary timeframe,</v>

2434
02:08:35.950 --> 02:08:40.950
<v Speaker 4>but it's not derived from the world of </v>
<v Speaker 4>facts over the timeframe that you </v>

2435
02:08:40.950 --> 02:08:40.950
<v Speaker 4>inhabit and it can't be.</v>

2436
02:08:41.740 --> 02:08:46.740
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The problem I have with our discussion </v>

2437
02:08:46.740 --> 02:08:50.191
<v Speaker 4>so far isn't really any of Sam's </v>
<v Speaker 4>fundamental ethical claims because I do </v>

2438
02:08:50.191 --> 02:08:54.841
<v Speaker 4>believe there's a distinction between </v>
<v Speaker 4>the hellish life and the heavenly life </v>

2439
02:08:54.841 --> 02:08:57.820
<v Speaker 4>say the life that everyone would agree </v>
<v Speaker 4>with absolutely not worth living and the</v>

2440
02:08:57.821 --> 02:09:02.821
<v Speaker 4>life we could imagine as good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I do believe that we should be </v>

2441
02:09:02.821 --> 02:09:05.641
<v Speaker 4>moving from one to the other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The question is exactly how is it that </v>

2442
02:09:06.851 --> 02:09:09.940
<v Speaker 4>we make the decisions that will guide us</v>
<v Speaker 4>along that way.</v>

2443
02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:13.330
<v Speaker 4>And I don't believe we can make them </v>
<v Speaker 4>without that April to restructure.</v>

2444
02:09:13.331 --> 02:09:18.331
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the evidence is absolutely </v>

2445
02:09:18.331 --> 02:09:20.641
<v Speaker 4>overwhelming that we can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I mean also the scientific evidence </v>

2446
02:09:20.641 --> 02:09:23.200
<v Speaker 4>and I would like to go further into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>devil that's in those details.</v>

2447
02:09:23.710 --> 02:09:27.520
<v Speaker 4>And so that's my situation.</v>

2448
02:09:37.520 --> 02:09:40.550
<v Speaker 2>Thanks.</v>

2449
02:09:43.340 --> 02:09:47.640
<v Speaker 3>Hope part of these conversations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now if you,</v>

2450
02:09:47.650 --> 02:09:50.050
<v Speaker 3>and I've had I think four conference </v>
<v Speaker 3>done,</v>

2451
02:09:50.051 --> 02:09:51.970
<v Speaker 3>two podcasts in this or a second live </v>
<v Speaker 3>event.</v>

2452
02:09:53.500 --> 02:09:55.540
<v Speaker 3>And thank you for doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>

2453
02:09:55.541 --> 02:09:56.360
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2454
02:09:56.361 --> 02:10:01.361
<v Speaker 3>it's my pleasure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>honor to do this.</v>

2455
02:10:04.690 --> 02:10:06.270
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2456
02:10:06.400 --> 02:10:09.280
<v Speaker 3>it comes with risks for both of us to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

2457
02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:13.740
<v Speaker 3>I think you can sense we don't have </v>
<v Speaker 3>precisely the same audiences.</v>

2458
02:10:14.050 --> 02:10:19.050
<v Speaker 3>All of you are sort of rooting for one </v>
<v Speaker 3>or the other of us to some degree for </v>

2459
02:10:19.090 --> 02:10:20.480
<v Speaker 3>the spirit of truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

2460
02:10:21.040 --> 02:10:26.040
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but clearly</v>

2461
02:10:28.620 --> 02:10:30.960
<v Speaker 3>the conversation is the point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2462
02:10:30.961 --> 02:10:35.961
<v Speaker 3>This is not though this conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the character at many moments of a </v>

2463
02:10:35.961 --> 02:10:40.331
<v Speaker 3>debate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think either of us view it as a </v>

2464
02:10:40.331 --> 02:10:43.511
<v Speaker 3>debate in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the trivial sense is not about point </v>

2465
02:10:43.511 --> 02:10:46.751
<v Speaker 3>scoring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about making sense in a way that's </v>

2466
02:10:46.751 --> 02:10:51.040
<v Speaker 3>consequential because we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about issues of great consequence and </v>

2467
02:10:51.040 --> 02:10:54.920
<v Speaker 3>you obviously care about these things </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it matters whether we converge on </v>

2468
02:10:56.511 --> 02:10:59.630
<v Speaker 3>the most important questions in human </v>
<v Speaker 3>life and as you know,</v>

2469
02:10:59.631 --> 02:11:04.631
<v Speaker 3>I'm worried that religion doesn't give </v>
<v Speaker 3>us the tools we need to converge what </v>

2470
02:11:05.180 --> 02:11:10.180
<v Speaker 3>does give us the tools is a truly open </v>
<v Speaker 3>ended conversation and then you simply </v>

2471
02:11:15.561 --> 02:11:19.220
<v Speaker 3>have to look honestly at the obstacles </v>
<v Speaker 3>toward any conversation.</v>

2472
02:11:19.221 --> 02:11:24.221
<v Speaker 3>Being open ended and religion presents </v>
<v Speaker 3>those first and most readily.</v>

2473
02:11:26.211 --> 02:11:31.211
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is a had the idea that certain things</v>

2474
02:11:31.311 --> 02:11:36.311
<v Speaker 3>have been decided for all time and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no future evidence or argument </v>

2475
02:11:37.610 --> 02:11:39.500
<v Speaker 3>that is admissible on those points.</v>

2476
02:11:39.860 --> 02:11:42.890
<v Speaker 3>Now that is clearly bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everywhere in science.</v>

2477
02:11:43.280 --> 02:11:48.280
<v Speaker 3>It's bad everywhere in in how we </v>
<v Speaker 3>renegotiate our proximity to one another</v>

2478
02:11:49.761 --> 02:11:54.080
<v Speaker 3>in society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It a new laws and new ideas are born all</v>

2479
02:11:54.081 --> 02:11:59.081
<v Speaker 3>the time about how to structure </v>
<v Speaker 3>institutions and social relationships </v>

2480
02:11:59.081 --> 02:11:59.690
<v Speaker 3>because new things happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2481
02:11:59.710 --> 02:12:01.820
<v Speaker 3>we didn't have an internet and then we </v>
<v Speaker 3>did,</v>

2482
02:12:01.850 --> 02:12:06.850
<v Speaker 3>so our old laws and our old expectations</v>
<v Speaker 3>of human communication simply don't work</v>

2483
02:12:07.610 --> 02:12:09.080
<v Speaker 3>in the presence of this new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2484
02:12:09.081 --> 02:12:10.240
<v Speaker 3>So we have to figure out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

2485
02:12:10.250 --> 02:12:15.250
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a navigation problem and what I'm </v>

2486
02:12:15.250 --> 02:12:18.640
<v Speaker 3>perpetually in contest when even in </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversations like this is the sense </v>

2487
02:12:21.080 --> 02:12:26.080
<v Speaker 3>that the rules need to change just a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit for this class of books that </v>

2488
02:12:27.800 --> 02:12:30.950
<v Speaker 3>literally this side of the bookstore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2489
02:12:30.951 --> 02:12:35.951
<v Speaker 3>There's like any other part of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bookstore will then there's no barrier </v>

2490
02:12:35.951 --> 02:12:37.850
<v Speaker 3>to honest conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you move over here.</v>

2491
02:12:37.880 --> 02:12:42.880
<v Speaker 3>They got this shelf of books there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to hold your tongue right </v>

2492
02:12:42.880 --> 02:12:44.750
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can't pick and choose.</v>

2493
02:12:45.110 --> 02:12:50.110
<v Speaker 3>We can't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>While we can say that Shakespeare wrote </v>

2494
02:12:50.110 --> 02:12:53.171
<v Speaker 3>some fantastic players,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best players ever written and some </v>

2495
02:12:53.171 --> 02:12:53.171
<v Speaker 3>are actually not that good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2496
02:12:53.171 --> 02:12:55.010
<v Speaker 3>We can't say that about God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2497
02:12:55.011 --> 02:13:00.011
<v Speaker 3>We have to find some tortured way to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make the most of his diabolical </v>

2498
02:13:00.011 --> 02:13:00.011
<v Speaker 3>utterances.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2499
02:13:00.800 --> 02:13:05.800
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing we have to outgrow and </v>
<v Speaker 3>so what I'm continually intention with </v>

2500
02:13:05.800 --> 02:13:10.001
<v Speaker 3>you is the degree to which your style of</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about religion and narrow the </v>

2501
02:13:12.321 --> 02:13:17.321
<v Speaker 3>power of narrative and the meaning </v>
<v Speaker 3>derived from it aligns that point and </v>

2502
02:13:17.930 --> 02:13:21.480
<v Speaker 3>seems to let people off the hook on that</v>
<v Speaker 3>very point and that's the.</v>

2503
02:13:21.860 --> 02:13:23.960
<v Speaker 3>That's where we need to hold the line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In my view,</v>

2504
02:13:23.961 --> 02:13:25.520
<v Speaker 3>we need to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need to</v>

2505
02:13:26.790 --> 02:13:27.140
<v Speaker 2>sure</v>

2506
02:13:32.080 --> 02:13:37.080
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it has to be clear to us at this </v>

2507
02:13:37.080 --> 02:13:41.491
<v Speaker 3>moment in history that no one has the </v>
<v Speaker 3>right to their religious sectarianism.</v>

2508
02:13:43.060 --> 02:13:45.580
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it it up to the point.</v>

2509
02:13:45.970 --> 02:13:50.970
<v Speaker 3>Clearly there's a soccer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a World Cup version of it that </v>

2510
02:13:50.970 --> 02:13:54.010
<v Speaker 3>has benign,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but once it gets taken past that point,</v>

2511
02:13:54.670 --> 02:13:59.670
<v Speaker 3>we we have to figure out how to pull the</v>
<v Speaker 3>brakes and that becomes a real problem.</v>

2512
02:14:00.730 --> 02:14:04.300
<v Speaker 3>If your.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you going to dignify the foundational</v>

2513
02:14:04.301 --> 02:14:09.301
<v Speaker 3>claims of these faiths claims like </v>
<v Speaker 3>revelation and paradise and blast </v>

2514
02:14:09.301 --> 02:14:14.001
<v Speaker 3>swimming and apostasy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and these are things that you come up </v>

2515
02:14:14.001 --> 02:14:16.801
<v Speaker 3>against and I think conversations like </v>
<v Speaker 3>this are incredibly important because we</v>

2516
02:14:18.880 --> 02:14:23.880
<v Speaker 3>need to convince the better part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>humanity that is possible to live the </v>

2517
02:14:23.981 --> 02:14:28.981
<v Speaker 3>best life possible without recourse to </v>
<v Speaker 3>divisive nonsense and where we draw the </v>

2518
02:14:31.271 --> 02:14:33.790
<v Speaker 3>line between divisive nonsense and </v>
<v Speaker 3>reasoned,</v>

2519
02:14:33.791 --> 02:14:37.050
<v Speaker 3>unnecessary discourse is what we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're dickering over and I think,</v>

2520
02:14:37.150 --> 02:14:39.250
<v Speaker 3>I think it's important that we continue.</v>

2521
02:14:43.310 --> 02:14:48.310
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

2522
02:14:56.820 --> 02:14:59.580
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

2523
02:15:00.090 --> 02:15:01.620
<v Speaker 1>In closing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me say,</v>

2524
02:15:01.920 --> 02:15:06.920
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm tremendously honored that you asked </v>

2525
02:15:06.920 --> 02:15:08.190
<v Speaker 1>me to moderate these debates.</v>

2526
02:15:09.150 --> 02:15:14.150
<v Speaker 2>Fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

2527
02:15:15.800 --> 02:15:16.930
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

2528
02:15:16.960 --> 02:15:21.070
<v Speaker 1>It was a truly remarkable experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As for what was accomplished,</v>

2529
02:15:21.100 --> 02:15:25.150
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a tremendous amount.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw both of you move.</v>

2530
02:15:25.151 --> 02:15:30.151
<v Speaker 1>I saw both of you exhibit tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 1>generosity of spirit towards the other </v>

2531
02:15:30.160 --> 02:15:31.660
<v Speaker 1>and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2532
02:15:31.720 --> 02:15:36.720
<v Speaker 1>this has exceeded my expectations of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what might've been possible in these </v>

2533
02:15:36.720 --> 02:15:37.960
<v Speaker 1>discussions by quite a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2534
02:15:37.961 --> 02:15:42.961
<v Speaker 1>and that also I will say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has a lot to do with the fact that for </v>

2535
02:15:43.121 --> 02:15:47.530
<v Speaker 1>reasons I think none of us can explain a</v>
<v Speaker 1>huge amount of people,</v>

2536
02:15:47.531 --> 02:15:52.531
<v Speaker 1>a huge population seems to care about </v>
<v Speaker 1>these issues because they matter a great</v>

2537
02:15:53.381 --> 02:15:54.400
<v Speaker 1>deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

2538
02:15:54.401 --> 02:15:59.401
<v Speaker 1>I think this has been a very successful </v>
<v Speaker 1>exercise and I think you both justly be </v>

2539
02:15:59.401 --> 02:16:00.010
<v Speaker 1>quite proud of what you've done.</v>

2540
02:16:00.610 --> 02:16:02.290
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's give a huge round of applause.</v>

2541
02:16:04.040 --> 02:16:09.040
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks.</v>
