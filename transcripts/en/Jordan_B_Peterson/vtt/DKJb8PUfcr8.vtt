1
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.490
<v Speaker 1>We're going to collabs lecture eight and</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine together</v>

2
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.520
<v Speaker 1>since there's no class on the 27th.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bsa is now due on the third of April,</v>

3
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.530
<v Speaker 1>the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just after reading.</v>

4
00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.263
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

5
00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.220
<v Speaker 1>I suppose for the next essays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although once again you're</v>

6
00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.860
<v Speaker 1>obliged to pick your own topic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some use,</v>

7
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.893
<v Speaker 1>some reliance on the secondary meetings </v>
<v Speaker 1>would probably be useful because one of </v>

8
00:01:20.981 --> 00:01:21.814
<v Speaker 1>the things that concerns me is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people aren't going to do the secondary </v>

9
00:01:24.311 --> 00:01:25.144
<v Speaker 1>reading since we don't talk much about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the in class since I don't make it a </v>

10
00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.530
<v Speaker 1>point of pestering you with exams or </v>
<v Speaker 1>such.</v>

11
00:01:32.531 --> 00:01:35.260
<v Speaker 1>Regarding the secondary readings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are important.</v>

12
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.550
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did I want to ask you,</v>

13
00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.150
<v Speaker 1>did I go over in this class the purpose </v>
<v Speaker 1>of each of the readings?</v>

14
00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.220
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

15
00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.100
<v Speaker 1>I did that my other class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do that now.</v>

16
00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.340
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to tell you why I wanted you</v>
<v Speaker 1>to read what I outlined?</v>

17
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.883
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the purpose of the neuropsychological </v>

18
00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.510
<v Speaker 1>papers that does everybody have their </v>
<v Speaker 1>syllabus.</v>

19
00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:00.123
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

20
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.233
<v Speaker 1>The purpose of the neuropsychological </v>
<v Speaker 1>papers is pretty much obvious to get to </v>

21
00:02:05.201 --> 00:02:06.034
<v Speaker 1>give you some additional material </v>
<v Speaker 1>bearing on neuro psychology to sort of </v>

22
00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:12.050
<v Speaker 1>flesh out the additional discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

23
00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.980
<v Speaker 1>Newman's book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the origins and History of consciousness</v>

24
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.040
<v Speaker 1>provides the best overview that I know</v>
<v Speaker 1>of here on mythology.</v>

25
00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.883
<v Speaker 1>The most accurate overview.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a book that's much like Joseph </v>

26
00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.060
<v Speaker 1>Campbell's hero with a thousand faces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except I think it's the.</v>

27
00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.580
<v Speaker 1>See the problem with Joseph Campbell is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he's too optimistic he'll.</v>

28
00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.953
<v Speaker 1>For Campbell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hero's journey is something that's </v>

29
00:02:40.841 --> 00:02:43.480
<v Speaker 1>always positive and I don't think that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>

30
00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.520
<v Speaker 1>I think it's more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

31
00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:48.363
<v Speaker 1>I mean the standard hero myth in Western</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture is Christ's passion that </v>

32
00:02:52.301 --> 00:02:56.530
<v Speaker 1>involves</v>
<v Speaker 1>exposure to a hostile group,</v>

33
00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.050
<v Speaker 1>torture and then dad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

34
00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.093
<v Speaker 1>that aspect of the hero myth at least </v>
<v Speaker 1>could not be construed as particularly </v>

35
00:03:06.611 --> 00:03:08.740
<v Speaker 1>positive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

36
00:03:08.741 --> 00:03:09.574
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that new ones work is for </v>

37
00:03:10.931 --> 00:03:15.100
<v Speaker 1>original</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the great mother.</v>

38
00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.700
<v Speaker 1>While the reason that I want you to read</v>
<v Speaker 1>the great mother is because.</v>

39
00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:21.623
<v Speaker 1>Let me read you something from ham here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First would be a good introduction to </v>

40
00:03:24.581 --> 00:03:25.414
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like this quote because a Donald Hebb </v>

41
00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.050
<v Speaker 1>is extraordinarily well regarded by </v>
<v Speaker 1>physiological psychologist.</v>

42
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.123
<v Speaker 1>He was the person who originated the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis that I'm of neural networks </v>

43
00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:43.990
<v Speaker 1>basically and um,</v>

44
00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.140
<v Speaker 1>suggested that learning occurred as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of potentiation,</v>

45
00:03:49.141 --> 00:03:52.410
<v Speaker 1>of the communication between neurons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

46
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.790
<v Speaker 1>head states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even in ourselves.</v>

47
00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.823
<v Speaker 1>Civilized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amiable and admirable parts of mankind </v>

48
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.080
<v Speaker 1>well brought up and not constantly in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>state of fear.</v>

49
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.453
<v Speaker 1>There are signs that this or that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends as much on our successfully </v>

50
00:04:08.311 --> 00:04:09.144
<v Speaker 1>avoiding disturbing stimulation as on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lower sensitivity has already suggested </v>

51
00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.750
<v Speaker 1>the capacity for emotional breakdown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe self concealing leaving the animal</v>

52
00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:24.240
<v Speaker 1>to find or create an environment in </v>
<v Speaker 1>which the stimuli to excessive emotional</v>

53
00:04:24.241 --> 00:04:29.241
<v Speaker 1>responses are at a minimum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So effective is our society in disregard</v>

54
00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.043
<v Speaker 1>that it's members,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the well to do and educated </v>

55
00:04:34.171 --> 00:04:37.080
<v Speaker 1>ones may not even guess at some of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>own potential realities.</v>

56
00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:38.363
<v Speaker 1>One usually thinks an education in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>broad sense that's producing a </v>

57
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.193
<v Speaker 1>resourceful emotionally stable adult </v>
<v Speaker 1>without respect to the environment in </v>

58
00:04:45.001 --> 00:04:48.060
<v Speaker 1>which these traits are to appear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To some extent,</v>

59
00:04:48.061 --> 00:04:48.894
<v Speaker 1>this may be true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but education can be seen as being also </v>

60
00:04:51.421 --> 00:04:52.254
<v Speaker 1>the means of establishing a protective </v>
<v Speaker 1>social environment in which emotion </v>

61
00:04:55.291 --> 00:04:56.520
<v Speaker 1>instability as possible.</v>

62
00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:02.080
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps it strengthens the individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>against unreasonable fears and rages,</v>

63
00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:03.573
<v Speaker 1>but it's certainly produces the </v>
<v Speaker 1>uniformity of appearance and behavior </v>

64
00:05:05.981 --> 00:05:06.814
<v Speaker 1>which reduces the frequency with which </v>
<v Speaker 1>the individual member of the society </v>

65
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:14.790
<v Speaker 1>encounter such causes a disturbance on </v>
<v Speaker 1>this via the susceptibility to emotional</v>

66
00:05:14.831 --> 00:05:15.664
<v Speaker 1>disturbance may not be decreased.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It may in fact be increased the </v>

67
00:05:18.881 --> 00:05:21.910
<v Speaker 1>protective cocoon of uniformity in </v>
<v Speaker 1>personal appearance.</v>

68
00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.230
<v Speaker 1>Manners and social activity generally </v>
<v Speaker 1>will make small deviations from customer</v>

69
00:05:26.231 --> 00:05:29.740
<v Speaker 1>care increasingly</v>
<v Speaker 1>strange,</v>

70
00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.620
<v Speaker 1>exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The general thesis is sound increasingly</v>

71
00:05:32.621 --> 00:05:33.454
<v Speaker 1>intolerable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The inevitable small deviations from </v>

72
00:05:35.711 --> 00:05:36.544
<v Speaker 1>customers will bolt increasingly large </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the members of the society finding </v>

73
00:05:40.061 --> 00:05:42.520
<v Speaker 1>themselves tolerating trivial deviations</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

74
00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.410
<v Speaker 1>We'll continue to think of themselves as</v>
<v Speaker 1>socially adapted with that.</v>

75
00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.160
<v Speaker 1>The last sentence there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean when he says it a little,</v>

76
00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:53.143
<v Speaker 1>because first it is to read that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>even the slightest difference will be </v>

77
00:05:55.601 --> 00:05:56.434
<v Speaker 1>noticed as large,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you're saying that that we're </v>

78
00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.110
<v Speaker 1>bearing that there will be born well.</v>

79
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.180
<v Speaker 1>Does that mean that the biggest society </v>
<v Speaker 1>does.</v>

80
00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:06.803
<v Speaker 1>He just means that maybe I'll be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>tolerate you if your hair is an inch </v>

81
00:06:10.521 --> 00:06:13.070
<v Speaker 1>longer than mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if I can do that,</v>

82
00:06:13.071 --> 00:06:15.620
<v Speaker 1>I will think I'm taller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if it's three inches longer,</v>

83
00:06:15.621 --> 00:06:17.000
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said look out.</v>

84
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:18.583
<v Speaker 1>So what he's basically saying is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>range within which the definition of </v>

85
00:06:22.161 --> 00:06:25.730
<v Speaker 1>tolerance exists will become </v>
<v Speaker 1>increasingly restricted.</v>

86
00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.790
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>nonetheless,</v>

87
00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:30.860
<v Speaker 1>society will continue to think of itself</v>
<v Speaker 1>as Tom.</v>

88
00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:32.870
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

89
00:06:32.871 --> 00:06:36.740
<v Speaker 1>So now what does that have to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the great mother,</v>

90
00:06:36.741 --> 00:06:40.040
<v Speaker 1>which was of course the question that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>addressed the quote to,</v>

91
00:06:40.041 --> 00:06:42.170
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if have this right,</v>

92
00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:45.890
<v Speaker 1>and other people have made very similar </v>
<v Speaker 1>suggestions,</v>

93
00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:52.300
<v Speaker 1>including you who said that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is quite hilarious.</v>

94
00:06:52.641 --> 00:06:53.474
<v Speaker 1>I think he said what is ordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>called religion is a substitute to such </v>

95
00:06:56.751 --> 00:06:57.584
<v Speaker 1>an amazing degree that I asked myself </v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously when did this kind of </v>

96
00:06:59.661 --> 00:07:01.690
<v Speaker 1>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I prefer to call a creed,</v>

97
00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:02.713
<v Speaker 1>may not after all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have an important function in human </v>

98
00:07:04.191 --> 00:07:05.024
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>

99
00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:06.513
<v Speaker 1>The substitute has the obvious purpose </v>
<v Speaker 1>of replacing immediate experienced by a </v>

100
00:07:09.201 --> 00:07:12.440
<v Speaker 1>choice of suitable symbols,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tricked out with an organized dogma,</v>

101
00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:14.450
<v Speaker 1>and Rachel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Catholic Church,</v>

102
00:07:14.451 --> 00:07:16.370
<v Speaker 1>maintains the by her indisputable </v>
<v Speaker 1>authority,</v>

103
00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:17.533
<v Speaker 1>the Protestant church,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if this term is still applicable by </v>

104
00:07:19.551 --> 00:07:21.890
<v Speaker 1>insistence on belief and the evangelical</v>
<v Speaker 1>message,</v>

105
00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:26.960
<v Speaker 1>so long as these principles work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are effectively protected against</v>

106
00:07:26.961 --> 00:07:31.500
<v Speaker 1>the media who they just experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The notion being that the purpose of dog</v>

107
00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:37.750
<v Speaker 1>culture is protect people from religious</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience now might think,</v>

108
00:07:38.721 --> 00:07:39.554
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why does it have to do with him </v>

109
00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:40.670
<v Speaker 1>statement?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

110
00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:43.123
<v Speaker 1>the essence of religious experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>might be regarded as as overwhelming </v>

111
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:47.383
<v Speaker 1>emotional experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what young is saying is that the </v>

112
00:07:50.481 --> 00:07:51.314
<v Speaker 1>purpose of Dogma</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to protect you from encounter with </v>

113
00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:56.843
<v Speaker 1>the most fundamental emotions and have </v>
<v Speaker 1>points out that culture may protect you </v>

114
00:08:01.881 --> 00:08:02.714
<v Speaker 1>so well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you have no idea what it is that </v>

115
00:08:03.981 --> 00:08:04.814
<v Speaker 1>you're being protected from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The general thesis of this course is </v>

116
00:08:08.721 --> 00:08:11.240
<v Speaker 1>that the thing that you are protected </v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

117
00:08:11.241 --> 00:08:12.074
<v Speaker 1>it's so terrible that you'll do anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>to maintain the protection even though </v>

118
00:08:17.061 --> 00:08:20.090
<v Speaker 1>under most circumstances you won't even </v>
<v Speaker 1>know that it's there.</v>

119
00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.233
<v Speaker 1>The reason I want you to read the great </v>
<v Speaker 1>mothers because it contains a </v>

120
00:08:26.241 --> 00:08:27.074
<v Speaker 1>description of symbols that have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>accumulated in innumerable societies </v>

121
00:08:30.771 --> 00:08:31.604
<v Speaker 1>over thousands of years that have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>created in an attempt to portray the </v>

122
00:08:37.011 --> 00:08:40.430
<v Speaker 1>nature of what is so terrible that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>cannot tolerate it,</v>

123
00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:42.043
<v Speaker 1>and to the degree that art works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this symbolic representations of the </v>

124
00:08:47.661 --> 00:08:51.690
<v Speaker 1>unknown are effective because most of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those I would say,</v>

125
00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:53.120
<v Speaker 1>fact that what our does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

126
00:08:53.121 --> 00:08:56.160
<v Speaker 1>if you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about it this way,</v>

127
00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:57.103
<v Speaker 1>that the purpose of culture isn't as </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar to Oregon and that's one way of </v>

128
00:09:00.361 --> 00:09:01.194
<v Speaker 1>looking at it and the processes that </v>
<v Speaker 1>exist around the perimeters of the </v>

129
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:05.430
<v Speaker 1>Oregon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

130
00:09:05.431 --> 00:09:07.440
<v Speaker 1>Think of it as an island.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always expanding.</v>

131
00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:08.663
<v Speaker 1>The processes that work in the middle of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the island aren't the same processes </v>

132
00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:13.800
<v Speaker 1>that work on the edges,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the clothes that you are to the middle,</v>

133
00:09:13.801 --> 00:09:14.460
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

134
00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:15.293
<v Speaker 1>The more things are absolutely defined </v>
<v Speaker 1>which which is to say that you can </v>

135
00:09:18.091 --> 00:09:18.924
<v Speaker 1>explain them in words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They very predictable and been given a </v>

136
00:09:20.581 --> 00:09:22.380
<v Speaker 1>rational,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rational underpinnings.</v>

137
00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:25.590
<v Speaker 1>They're explicitly discussable there </v>
<v Speaker 1>semantically formulated,</v>

138
00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:26.663
<v Speaker 1>but around the edges,</v>
<v Speaker 1>x word peculiar activities still takes </v>

139
00:09:29.221 --> 00:09:30.054
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be the initial stages of the </v>

140
00:09:31.111 --> 00:09:34.530
<v Speaker 1>assimilation process and that's where </v>
<v Speaker 1>fantasy plays a big,</v>

141
00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:35.603
<v Speaker 1>big role because fantasy is the place </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the unknown first transforms </v>

142
00:09:39.031 --> 00:09:39.864
<v Speaker 1>itself into the unknown and while you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could say that people's use of symbols </v>

143
00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:45.080
<v Speaker 1>and that sort of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

144
00:09:45.081 --> 00:09:48.480
<v Speaker 1>artistic productions are their attempt </v>
<v Speaker 1>to make up the unknown.</v>

145
00:09:48.481 --> 00:09:50.050
<v Speaker 1>Something provisionally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

146
00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:53.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think that's what art is doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always working as it,</v>

147
00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:56.970
<v Speaker 1>as the little cow where new information </v>
<v Speaker 1>is being fed.</v>

148
00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.760
<v Speaker 1>New cultural information is being fed </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the culture.</v>

149
00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:01.260
<v Speaker 1>That's its purpose.</v>

150
00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.630
<v Speaker 2>And there's a book by</v>

151
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.150
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was an address by social units and</v>

152
00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:12.060
<v Speaker 1>the Nobel prize winning addressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's called beauty will save the</v>

153
00:10:12.061 --> 00:10:14.460
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a dusty esky quote.</v>

154
00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:18.150
<v Speaker 1>And this is an argument that social </v>
<v Speaker 1>media makes that link of purpose of,</v>

155
00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.910
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of higher order culture,</v>

156
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:21.953
<v Speaker 1>the humanities and the arts on to open a</v>
<v Speaker 1>window into those domains that still </v>

157
00:10:26.521 --> 00:10:29.610
<v Speaker 1>exist as unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to let some new information in,</v>

158
00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:30.900
<v Speaker 1>you would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

159
00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:36.360
<v Speaker 1>artistic religious symbols of that sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>function to do that.</v>

160
00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:41.580
<v Speaker 1>Over time they performed their function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they lose their vitality.</v>

161
00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:43.380
<v Speaker 1>So you can't tell what they mean </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

162
00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:44.243
<v Speaker 1>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't intrinsically attract your </v>

163
00:10:45.571 --> 00:10:47.700
<v Speaker 1>attention anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forget what they mean.</v>

164
00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:49.063
<v Speaker 1>The reason I want you to read the great </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother and to look at the in there so </v>

165
00:10:52.551 --> 00:10:55.530
<v Speaker 1>that</v>
<v Speaker 1>with any luck,</v>

166
00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:57.503
<v Speaker 1>what the people who made those </v>
<v Speaker 1>representations were trying to </v>

167
00:10:59.791 --> 00:11:04.791
<v Speaker 1>communicate will retain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's significant so that you can see the</v>

168
00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:09.890
<v Speaker 1>nature of the terror that religious dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one culture in general,</v>

169
00:11:10.141 --> 00:11:13.640
<v Speaker 1>which gives everything a uniform </v>
<v Speaker 1>appearance of irregularity.</v>

170
00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:14.993
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was what that was all directed to </v>

171
00:11:16.711 --> 00:11:21.570
<v Speaker 1>protect us against.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now it's the purpose of that whole.</v>

172
00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:23.640
<v Speaker 1>And I think if you read it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will do it.</v>

173
00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.460
<v Speaker 2>What's the title of Associate Address?</v>

174
00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:30.770
<v Speaker 1>Beauty will save the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have the essay in a collection</v>

175
00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.200
<v Speaker 2>than I can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can show you.</v>

176
00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:38.140
<v Speaker 1>Even if you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at it this way.</v>

177
00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:40.840
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you walk into a museum.</v>

178
00:11:40.841 --> 00:11:43.150
<v Speaker 1>Mrs Happened to me on a number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>locations.</v>

179
00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:44.793
<v Speaker 1>There's all paintings everywhere and </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them have no emotional </v>

180
00:11:48.071 --> 00:11:49.420
<v Speaker 1>significance at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

181
00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:53.890
<v Speaker 1>you might try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>generate some sort artificially,</v>

182
00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:57.160
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of them just don't capture you</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

183
00:11:57.161 --> 00:11:59.080
<v Speaker 1>And then if you're lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're in a good museum,</v>

184
00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:03.190
<v Speaker 1>I suppose whether you know something or </v>
<v Speaker 1>not also makes a difference,</v>

185
00:12:03.191 --> 00:12:08.191
<v Speaker 1>but you'll come across a payday or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>statue that will grab you and the reason</v>

186
00:12:08.231 --> 00:12:09.310
<v Speaker 1>that grabs you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

187
00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:10.990
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a visual portrayal.</v>

188
00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:16.400
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then go.</v>

189
00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:18.603
<v Speaker 1>That's a good example of sunflowers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What van Gogh managers to do is to </v>

190
00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:27.520
<v Speaker 1>present you something that's familiar or</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you think is familiar,</v>

191
00:12:27.521 --> 00:12:29.590
<v Speaker 1>which means something that you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>habituated to,</v>

192
00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:32.200
<v Speaker 1>which means something that you think you</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand,</v>

193
00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:38.310
<v Speaker 1>but he twists it so that the phenomena </v>
<v Speaker 1>now retains that.</v>

194
00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:39.813
<v Speaker 1>The novelty that perhaps it once had </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you first encountered the thing or </v>

195
00:12:44.561 --> 00:12:45.394
<v Speaker 1>in the primeval state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose would be a symbolic way of </v>

196
00:12:47.681 --> 00:12:49.900
<v Speaker 1>looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what the artist's forces you to do,</v>

197
00:12:49.901 --> 00:12:50.734
<v Speaker 1>at least momentarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's to snap out of the or habituated </v>

198
00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:53.553
<v Speaker 1>complacency and to view the object </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's being represented as something </v>

199
00:12:57.551 --> 00:13:02.551
<v Speaker 1>that has not yet lost its sheen of arts </v>
<v Speaker 1>pristine.</v>

200
00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:07.583
<v Speaker 1>It's pristine aspect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then you can see what's actually </v>

201
00:13:10.291 --> 00:13:13.980
<v Speaker 1>there instead of looking at your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>memory,</v>

202
00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:15.053
<v Speaker 1>which is what you almost always do when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at something and you have very </v>

203
00:13:17.491 --> 00:13:21.300
<v Speaker 1>limited attentional capacity and almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that you encountered,</v>

204
00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:24.990
<v Speaker 1>you see as a representation of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

205
00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:27.390
<v Speaker 1>Everything that you've explored before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how your brain,</v>

206
00:13:27.391 --> 00:13:30.690
<v Speaker 1>in a sense makes the most use out of its</v>
<v Speaker 1>limited capacity.</v>

207
00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:35.340
<v Speaker 1>You always watch your own memory and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>great artist is someone who can snap you</v>

208
00:13:35.341 --> 00:13:36.174
<v Speaker 1>out of that momentarily to make you see </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's actually there and theoretically </v>

209
00:13:39.571 --> 00:13:40.404
<v Speaker 1>that can give you some insight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some additional insight into the nature </v>

210
00:13:42.811 --> 00:13:43.644
<v Speaker 1>of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And art in that sense still has a </v>

211
00:13:45.901 --> 00:13:46.734
<v Speaker 1>religious function in their arch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Originally only had a religious </v>

212
00:13:49.561 --> 00:13:51.960
<v Speaker 1>function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's only had a nonreligious function in</v>

213
00:13:51.961 --> 00:13:55.800
<v Speaker 1>the west for maybe 400 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

214
00:13:57.490 --> 00:14:02.490
<v Speaker 1>for the bulk of human history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>art played an explicitly and that's what</v>

215
00:14:02.731 --> 00:14:03.450
<v Speaker 1>it's trying to do.</v>

216
00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:08.450
<v Speaker 1>It's the place where information</v>
<v Speaker 1>is first manifest,</v>

217
00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:13.930
<v Speaker 1>first manifests itself before it becomes</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's concrete and</v>

218
00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:18.270
<v Speaker 1>candidate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

219
00:14:18.271 --> 00:14:19.710
<v Speaker 1>hopefully if you look at the great </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother,</v>

220
00:14:19.711 --> 00:14:20.544
<v Speaker 1>you'll be able to see these </v>
<v Speaker 1>constructions with the same eyes that </v>

221
00:14:25.591 --> 00:14:28.950
<v Speaker 1>the people who originally made them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can tell if that happens because</v>

222
00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:31.493
<v Speaker 1>the objects will stop looking like </v>
<v Speaker 1>foreign cultural artifacts and start </v>

223
00:14:35.761 --> 00:14:38.070
<v Speaker 1>looking like representations of </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

224
00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:39.743
<v Speaker 1>And it's really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you can really see a shift in </v>

225
00:14:42.301 --> 00:14:43.380
<v Speaker 1>perception if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

226
00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:46.440
<v Speaker 1>if if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were doing the right thing,</v>

227
00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:51.000
<v Speaker 1>what you want to try to do is to occupy </v>
<v Speaker 1>the territory,</v>

228
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.033
<v Speaker 1>the person who originally constructed </v>
<v Speaker 1>the representation to see what it was </v>

229
00:14:55.431 --> 00:14:57.740
<v Speaker 1>that they were trying to portray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of these figures,</v>

230
00:14:57.741 --> 00:14:58.880
<v Speaker 1>they took a lot of work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

231
00:14:58.881 --> 00:14:59.714
<v Speaker 1>you have to be highly motivated to spend</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours or weeks or even years </v>

232
00:15:03.351 --> 00:15:04.184
<v Speaker 1>constructing a representation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that you don't really </v>

233
00:15:06.021 --> 00:15:06.854
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>

234
00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:10.670
<v Speaker 1>You have to put yourself in the position</v>
<v Speaker 1>of those people and see what it was,</v>

235
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:11.743
<v Speaker 1>what worked it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and think about what it must have been </v>

236
00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:14.983
<v Speaker 1>that grip them so hard to motivate them </v>
<v Speaker 1>to produce something that has so little </v>

237
00:15:19.281 --> 00:15:22.640
<v Speaker 1>apparent economic value and yet it takes</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much effort,</v>

238
00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:26.600
<v Speaker 1>so it's very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very worthwhile to do that.</v>

239
00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:30.980
<v Speaker 1>The use and abuse of history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the next leg.</v>

240
00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:31.913
<v Speaker 1>It's a very small book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason that I want you to read that </v>

241
00:15:35.181 --> 00:15:37.000
<v Speaker 1>is because it's the only book that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>know of.</v>

242
00:15:37.001 --> 00:15:41.690
<v Speaker 1>It clearly describes the pathological </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspect of culture,</v>

243
00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:45.590
<v Speaker 1>not the pathological aspect of any </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular culture,</v>

244
00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:49.790
<v Speaker 1>but the fact of the culture as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon necessarily.</v>

245
00:15:49.791 --> 00:15:54.791
<v Speaker 1>How's it pathological impact or </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathological aspect that's inevitable.</v>

246
00:15:56.350 --> 00:16:01.350
<v Speaker 1>He basically points out that</v>
<v Speaker 1>history is a burden as well as,</v>

247
00:16:01.911 --> 00:16:04.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well as a great advantage.</v>

248
00:16:04.911 --> 00:16:09.560
<v Speaker 1>And to put it simplistically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose what you might think of is the</v>

249
00:16:09.561 --> 00:16:13.640
<v Speaker 1>fact that if you're going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>classical musician,</v>

250
00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:14.503
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that innumerable classical </v>

251
00:16:16.251 --> 00:16:17.084
<v Speaker 1>musicians have lived before you is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendous opportunity because you have </v>

252
00:16:21.531 --> 00:16:26.510
<v Speaker 1>the opportunity to master the skills </v>
<v Speaker 1>they developed and transmitted,</v>

253
00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:27.853
<v Speaker 1>but by the same token,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also an incredible impediment to </v>

254
00:16:32.061 --> 00:16:36.890
<v Speaker 1>your own progress because your domain of</v>
<v Speaker 1>competition has become so broad,</v>

255
00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:38.113
<v Speaker 1>you know it only compete for preeminence</v>
<v Speaker 1>and recognition in the present with all </v>

256
00:16:41.961 --> 00:16:44.660
<v Speaker 1>the other people who are trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>become classical musicians,</v>

257
00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:45.943
<v Speaker 1>but you necessarily pit yourself against</v>
<v Speaker 1>those people who were the absolute best </v>

258
00:16:49.581 --> 00:16:53.450
<v Speaker 1>at that for as long as that particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>activity is being recorded.</v>

259
00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:54.703
<v Speaker 1>So as a consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're necessarily trivialized in </v>

260
00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:01.460
<v Speaker 1>relationship to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to these heroic figure something</v>

261
00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:03.970
<v Speaker 3>the past.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So neat.</v>

262
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:04.833
<v Speaker 3>You have also added to that by saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the great composers of the past </v>

263
00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:14.070
<v Speaker 3>have also limited the president composer</v>
<v Speaker 3>by making the eyes of of everyone around</v>

264
00:17:15.011 --> 00:17:16.660
<v Speaker 3>them used to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the,</v>

265
00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:17.523
<v Speaker 3>to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the kinds of stuff that previous one </v>

266
00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:20.950
<v Speaker 3>time at created would expect that.</v>

267
00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:21.890
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

268
00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:26.890
<v Speaker 1>Certainly whenever I think like I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you can see minor indications of</v>

269
00:17:27.401 --> 00:17:30.700
<v Speaker 1>this on an ongoing basis in our own </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

270
00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:33.820
<v Speaker 1>Like I think one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>mass,</v>

271
00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:37.270
<v Speaker 1>the mass reproduction of music for </v>
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>

272
00:17:37.271 --> 00:17:38.104
<v Speaker 1>has done because this also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This also occurs with televised events </v>

273
00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:47.440
<v Speaker 1>because the television is even more </v>
<v Speaker 1>accurate.</v>

274
00:17:47.441 --> 00:17:48.274
<v Speaker 1>What television does is make history of </v>
<v Speaker 1>an event as it curves and the fact that </v>

275
00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:53.873
<v Speaker 1>you get the historical perspective on </v>
<v Speaker 1>things as they're instantaneously </v>

276
00:17:57.271 --> 00:18:02.271
<v Speaker 1>occurring I think is very hard on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>own perception of the utility of meaning</v>

277
00:18:02.941 --> 00:18:06.120
<v Speaker 1>of your own life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It strikes me that increasingly we're in</v>

278
00:18:06.121 --> 00:18:06.954
<v Speaker 1>the position of not presuming that </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything is real unless we see it on </v>

279
00:18:09.481 --> 00:18:14.481
<v Speaker 1>television and that people have devalued</v>
<v Speaker 1>their own personal culture and I mean by</v>

280
00:18:14.731 --> 00:18:15.564
<v Speaker 1>that they're individual culture and </v>
<v Speaker 1>their familial culture in favor of this </v>

281
00:18:18.691 --> 00:18:22.620
<v Speaker 1>global culture which which although it </v>
<v Speaker 1>appears to be ongoing,</v>

282
00:18:22.621 --> 00:18:25.470
<v Speaker 1>is really sort of instant history.</v>

283
00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:26.873
<v Speaker 1>So the thing about a television has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll capture your attention no matter </v>

284
00:18:30.841 --> 00:18:31.620
<v Speaker 1>what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone.</v>

285
00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:32.453
<v Speaker 1>It'll capture your attention instantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which basically means that you're </v>

286
00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:37.373
<v Speaker 1>considering the thing that's being </v>
<v Speaker 1>portrayed as more important than </v>

287
00:18:39.871 --> 00:18:42.480
<v Speaker 1>anything that you could be doing at that</v>
<v Speaker 1>present time.</v>

288
00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:45.090
<v Speaker 1>So the how does that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How's that?</v>

289
00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:47.970
<v Speaker 1>Is that what you mean by history or do </v>
<v Speaker 1>you mean something else?</v>

290
00:18:47.971 --> 00:18:50.880
<v Speaker 1>By checking into history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning taken away,</v>

291
00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.700
<v Speaker 1>taken away what people would add to it </v>
<v Speaker 1>or.</v>

292
00:18:53.701 --> 00:18:55.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean what I understand what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

293
00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:56.640
<v Speaker 1>it's just part of the weight of the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like.</v>

294
00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:59.160
<v Speaker 1>The thing about television is that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole culture,</v>

295
00:18:59.161 --> 00:19:01.080
<v Speaker 1>right in your living room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

296
00:19:01.081 --> 00:19:03.240
<v Speaker 1>It's a tremendous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a tremendous.</v>

297
00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:06.270
<v Speaker 1>It competes tremendously for your </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>

298
00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:07.433
<v Speaker 1>I mean it offers you access </v>
<v Speaker 1>theoretically all these cultural </v>

299
00:19:09.811 --> 00:19:10.644
<v Speaker 1>resources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time simultaneously </v>

300
00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:17.250
<v Speaker 1>while you're engaged in getting access </v>
<v Speaker 1>to these resources,</v>

301
00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:18.233
<v Speaker 1>you're not actually living and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not producing or creating anything of </v>

302
00:19:20.911 --> 00:19:21.744
<v Speaker 1>your own so that it's a good example of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what Nietzsche is talking about when he </v>

303
00:19:24.931 --> 00:19:26.520
<v Speaker 1>talks about the abusive history.</v>

304
00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:27.653
<v Speaker 1>So wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets an opportunity because it's </v>

305
00:19:29.491 --> 00:19:30.324
<v Speaker 1>information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time it's a tremendous </v>

306
00:19:31.801 --> 00:19:33.640
<v Speaker 1>weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

307
00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:36.060
<v Speaker 1>you see this when you get people sitting</v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

308
00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:36.953
<v Speaker 1>This used to happen to me in graduate </v>
<v Speaker 1>school now and then when people would </v>

309
00:19:40.231 --> 00:19:41.064
<v Speaker 1>sit around and a large chunk of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>childhood memories that are shared </v>

310
00:19:44.401 --> 00:19:47.310
<v Speaker 1>memories were television shows that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>had all watched.</v>

311
00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:48.623
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is that instead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>having individual memories about the </v>

312
00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:53.683
<v Speaker 1>events,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have transpersonal memories about </v>

313
00:19:55.891 --> 00:19:59.730
<v Speaker 1>the same events that aren't even real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's another indication of how</v>

314
00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:01.051
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

315
00:20:01.051 --> 00:20:02.310
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very peculiar.</v>

316
00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:03.383
<v Speaker 1>Very peculiar.</v>

317
00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:06.393
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking that this was more </v>

318
00:20:07.291 --> 00:20:09.070
<v Speaker 1>trivial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was thinking the time</v>

319
00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:13.620
<v Speaker 1>that this has only happened over a span </v>
<v Speaker 1>of 40 years.</v>

320
00:20:13.621 --> 00:20:17.970
<v Speaker 1>Say Rock music is only 40 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as there was more and more of it,</v>

321
00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:23.090
<v Speaker 1>the likelihood that I'm stations like </v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

322
00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:23.933
<v Speaker 1>all these golden oldies stations popped </v>
<v Speaker 1>up in the eighties and they played like </v>

323
00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:28.830
<v Speaker 1>the music of the sixties and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>seventies.</v>

324
00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:29.963
<v Speaker 1>And what happens is there's a limited </v>
<v Speaker 1>bandwidth of radio and the historical </v>

325
00:20:33.751 --> 00:20:34.584
<v Speaker 1>productions occupy a broader and broader</v>
<v Speaker 1>section of the bandwidth until the new </v>

326
00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:40.020
<v Speaker 1>bands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

327
00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:43.380
<v Speaker 1>are not only competing against all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other bands who were now,</v>

328
00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:44.333
<v Speaker 1>but all the other bands that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>accumulated over this 40 year period </v>

329
00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:49.170
<v Speaker 1>when nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he talks about the weight of history,</v>

330
00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:53.260
<v Speaker 1>the accumulated weight of history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a trivial example as I said,</v>

331
00:20:53.261 --> 00:20:53.780
<v Speaker 1>but that's.</v>

332
00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:56.890
<v Speaker 1>It's still something that's happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the span of four years.</v>

333
00:20:57.490 --> 00:20:58.323
<v Speaker 1>So it's a burden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a very short essay that I </v>

334
00:21:01.931 --> 00:21:04.930
<v Speaker 1>thought was the best answer I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>encountered on that particular topic.</v>

335
00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:07.300
<v Speaker 1>So nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see the reason I like that,</v>

336
00:21:07.301 --> 00:21:10.410
<v Speaker 1>it's because they need to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Being an extraordinary burner.</v>

337
00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:15.430
<v Speaker 1>Genius was always cognizant of the fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you don't get this,</v>

338
00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:19.090
<v Speaker 1>which is like the protective aspect of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the great father.</v>

339
00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.730
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing that renders everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>predictable,</v>

340
00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:23.710
<v Speaker 1>intolerable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't get that.</v>

341
00:21:23.711 --> 00:21:24.544
<v Speaker 1>Then you can get it without also getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is that the wise king and the </v>

342
00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:33.200
<v Speaker 1>tyrants are inseparable and there can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>some movement back and forth from one to</v>

343
00:21:33.311 --> 00:21:34.060
<v Speaker 1>the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

344
00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:34.893
<v Speaker 1>it does seem upon occasion all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture can turn into something </v>

345
00:21:38.501 --> 00:21:39.334
<v Speaker 1>tyrannical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Nancy was pointing out that even in </v>

346
00:21:41.981 --> 00:21:42.814
<v Speaker 1>its most positive guys is the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there is culture constitutes an </v>

347
00:21:46.871 --> 00:21:47.704
<v Speaker 1>impediment to your own success as well </v>
<v Speaker 1>as one of the preconditions of your </v>

348
00:21:51.611 --> 00:21:56.470
<v Speaker 1>success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get kind of warped views of that.</v>

349
00:21:57.580 --> 00:21:59.740
<v Speaker 1>This is mostly interesting for those of </v>
<v Speaker 1>you who</v>

350
00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:03.970
<v Speaker 1>are interested in clinical psychology or</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychopathology.</v>

351
00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:05.763
<v Speaker 1>The humanistic branch of psychology </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically took this argument but only </v>

352
00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:11.290
<v Speaker 1>half of it and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

353
00:22:11.291 --> 00:22:13.990
<v Speaker 1>because one of their questions was </v>
<v Speaker 1>where?</v>

354
00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:16.780
<v Speaker 1>Where does human evil come from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where human suffering,</v>

355
00:22:16.781 --> 00:22:21.781
<v Speaker 1>I suppose it Carl Rogers and Abraham </v>
<v Speaker 1>maslow and probably the foremost</v>

356
00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:28.183
<v Speaker 1>exemplars of humanistic psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They basically made the presupposition </v>

357
00:22:31.221 --> 00:22:32.054
<v Speaker 1>that this is their story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The individuals intrinsically good and </v>

358
00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:39.440
<v Speaker 1>if you just provide the proper </v>
<v Speaker 1>preconditions,</v>

359
00:22:39.441 --> 00:22:40.274
<v Speaker 1>then everything will turn out positively</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the degree that the individual isn't </v>

360
00:22:44.271 --> 00:22:46.520
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because society,</v>

361
00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:49.460
<v Speaker 1>which is then cast complicity in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative role,</v>

362
00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:53.930
<v Speaker 1>distorts the possibilities of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual as he or she matures.</v>

363
00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:56.900
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good story and it's true.</v>

364
00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:57.913
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's obviously the case that as you </v>

365
00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:03.380
<v Speaker 1>mature all sorts of arbitrary </v>
<v Speaker 1>limitations and be placed on you,</v>

366
00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:07.610
<v Speaker 1>really arbitrary limitations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of which have crushed and distorted</v>

367
00:23:07.611 --> 00:23:12.611
<v Speaker 1>and work your your character in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>matters that might even be unalterable,</v>

368
00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:15.953
<v Speaker 1>but by the same token,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is also true is that you are an </v>

369
00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:25.980
<v Speaker 1>behave nasty little brood when you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>little and it was the positive aspect of</v>

370
00:23:26.701 --> 00:23:27.534
<v Speaker 1>culture in force on your behavior that </v>
<v Speaker 1>made you even vaguely socially </v>

371
00:23:31.891 --> 00:23:32.724
<v Speaker 1>acceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the humanists tend to tell one side </v>

372
00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:36.630
<v Speaker 1>of the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the thing.</v>

373
00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:38.570
<v Speaker 1>This is another reason why I really like</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

374
00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:41.880
<v Speaker 1>this diagram because it's a pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>simplistic diagram,</v>

375
00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:43.193
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that it's a complete story </v>
<v Speaker 1>is very useful and if you know the </v>

376
00:23:47.571 --> 00:23:49.580
<v Speaker 1>complete story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that,</v>

377
00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:50.571
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

378
00:23:50.571 --> 00:23:51.404
<v Speaker 1>there's negative aspects of culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're in separately tied to the </v>

379
00:23:54.711 --> 00:23:55.544
<v Speaker 1>positive aspects and yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are negative aspects of nature or </v>

380
00:23:58.911 --> 00:23:59.744
<v Speaker 1>the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are also positive aspects and </v>

381
00:24:02.091 --> 00:24:05.510
<v Speaker 1>likewise for the individual than it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you know that,</v>

382
00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:06.373
<v Speaker 1>if you understand what it means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it can stop you from falling sort </v>

383
00:24:08.721 --> 00:24:09.554
<v Speaker 1>of whole heartedly into what I think are</v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively one sided simplistic </v>

384
00:24:14.361 --> 00:24:16.190
<v Speaker 1>ideologies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if someone says,</v>

385
00:24:16.191 --> 00:24:17.024
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

386
00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:20.900
<v Speaker 1>all human evil is attributable to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>faults of society.</v>

387
00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:22.130
<v Speaker 1>You can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

388
00:24:22.131 --> 00:24:23.730
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

389
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:27.770
<v Speaker 1>here are all sorts of counterexamples to</v>
<v Speaker 1>that particular claim.</v>

390
00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:29.840
<v Speaker 1>Or if people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

391
00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:31.940
<v Speaker 1>because this is a common </v>
<v Speaker 1>environmentalist claim,</v>

392
00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:32.893
<v Speaker 1>sort of.</v>

393
00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:35.383
<v Speaker 1>This is kind of funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had another friend in graduate school </v>

394
00:24:38.481 --> 00:24:43.481
<v Speaker 1>who was a German great big guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was a German ancestry and uh,</v>

395
00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:48.350
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was really a nice fellow.</v>

396
00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:51.020
<v Speaker 1>Which meant that in your contact with </v>
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>

397
00:24:51.021 --> 00:24:56.021
<v Speaker 1>you never observed any overt aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

398
00:24:57.530 --> 00:25:02.530
<v Speaker 1>he told me once he was a left sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had your typical left leaning liberal</v>

399
00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:06.140
<v Speaker 1>philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ideology.</v>

400
00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:07.753
<v Speaker 1>He was environmentally concerned and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was anti big business and so on and so </v>

401
00:25:11.301 --> 00:25:12.950
<v Speaker 1>forth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is all perfectly reasonable.</v>

402
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:14.833
<v Speaker 1>But he told me once the planet would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>better off if there were no people on </v>

403
00:25:18.171 --> 00:25:19.004
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning that human beings intrude onto </v>

404
00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:23.750
<v Speaker 1>nature and destroy things and that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be better.</v>

405
00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:26.880
<v Speaker 1>But then I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's an interesting example,</v>

406
00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:30.500
<v Speaker 1>the collective unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose,</v>

407
00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:31.603
<v Speaker 1>because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the notion that the notion that the </v>

408
00:25:35.541 --> 00:25:39.190
<v Speaker 1>planet would be better off without </v>
<v Speaker 1>people in it presumes that</v>

409
00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:44.630
<v Speaker 1>nature is something that's all </v>
<v Speaker 1>beneficial.</v>

410
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.720
<v Speaker 1>The pristine and unspoiled nature is all</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive,</v>

411
00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:48.793
<v Speaker 1>so he is dominated by the archetype is </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominated by this architect is thinking </v>

412
00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:53.713
<v Speaker 1>unconsciously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thought nature was a French </v>

413
00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:58.160
<v Speaker 1>impressionist landscape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then he said,</v>

414
00:25:58.460 --> 00:25:59.293
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the planet would be better off without </v>

415
00:25:59.871 --> 00:26:00.704
<v Speaker 1>people on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which meant that if he was given his </v>

416
00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:06.830
<v Speaker 1>free rein of expression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would immediately become an exponent.</v>

417
00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:10.160
<v Speaker 1>This part of the great mother and do his</v>
<v Speaker 1>best to,</v>

418
00:26:10.910 --> 00:26:13.270
<v Speaker 1>to decimate everything that he could lay</v>
<v Speaker 1>his hands on.</v>

419
00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:16.880
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people than I thought.</v>

420
00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:21.260
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was interesting and in part</v>
<v Speaker 1>given his German cultural ancestry,</v>

421
00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:22.113
<v Speaker 1>because the idea that the planet would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be better off without people on it was </v>

422
00:26:25.101 --> 00:26:27.150
<v Speaker 1>certainly something that motivated the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nazis.</v>

423
00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:29.840
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so whenever you hear anybody say that,</v>

424
00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:31.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

425
00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:33.200
<v Speaker 1>he was no problem because he was in </v>
<v Speaker 1>graduate school,</v>

426
00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:34.303
<v Speaker 1>graduate students at most.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could recap all according to his </v>

427
00:26:36.621 --> 00:26:38.480
<v Speaker 1>girlfriend and maybe a few friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

428
00:26:38.481 --> 00:26:41.050
<v Speaker 1>if you really went into all out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

429
00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:43.063
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>

430
00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:48.610
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand what the frame of </v>
<v Speaker 3>references is that I'm negative.</v>

431
00:26:48.611 --> 00:26:49.444
<v Speaker 3>Positive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>positive to the individual or is it two </v>

432
00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:54.480
<v Speaker 3>areas are just innately negative or </v>
<v Speaker 3>positive?</v>

433
00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:55.310
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand.</v>

434
00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:58.070
<v Speaker 1>Is the emotional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's the emotional</v>

435
00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:00.853
<v Speaker 1>valence of the different domains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All I'm saying there is that any </v>

436
00:27:05.301 --> 00:27:06.134
<v Speaker 1>phenomena has the capacity to produce </v>
<v Speaker 1>both positive and negative emotions </v>

437
00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:12.160
<v Speaker 1>depending on the context and </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretation,</v>

438
00:27:12.650 --> 00:27:13.483
<v Speaker 1>sort of an implicit part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it would be in reference to the </v>

439
00:27:16.311 --> 00:27:17.450
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

440
00:27:17.451 --> 00:27:19.490
<v Speaker 1>So presumes a subject.</v>

441
00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:22.450
<v Speaker 3>So the negative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the negative aspect.</v>

442
00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:28.730
<v Speaker 3>So the great mother on this side where </v>
<v Speaker 3>the individual is positive,</v>

443
00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:29.700
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

444
00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:31.870
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is seen by the individual is negative.</v>

445
00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:33.580
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

446
00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:34.413
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see what you're saying there is the </v>

447
00:27:37.681 --> 00:27:41.210
<v Speaker 1>positive aspect of culture protects you </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the negative aspect of Don.</v>

448
00:27:41.211 --> 00:27:42.700
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

449
00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:46.380
<v Speaker 1>And here it's that the negative aspect </v>
<v Speaker 1>of culture,</v>

450
00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:48.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for bids,</v>

451
00:27:48.931 --> 00:27:51.540
<v Speaker 1>your contact with the positive aspect of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the unknown,</v>

452
00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:54.180
<v Speaker 1>which was your point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say with regard to the composers,</v>

453
00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:56.550
<v Speaker 1>there are ways that you should conduct </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

454
00:27:56.551 --> 00:27:57.384
<v Speaker 1>which means here's a whole set up </v>
<v Speaker 1>alternative possibilities which you're </v>

455
00:28:00.691 --> 00:28:04.680
<v Speaker 1>forbidden to explore and that's useful </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you won't become afraid,</v>

456
00:28:04.681 --> 00:28:09.681
<v Speaker 1>but it's constricting is restricted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>your potential domain of activity.</v>

457
00:28:11.450 --> 00:28:12.630
<v Speaker 1>And I would say here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

458
00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:13.763
<v Speaker 1>the reason these two are matched is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's the negative aspect of the </v>

459
00:28:18.991 --> 00:28:19.824
<v Speaker 1>individual that we'll see later that </v>
<v Speaker 1>heightens the likelihood that culture </v>

460
00:28:24.211 --> 00:28:26.730
<v Speaker 1>will take on a negative or tyrannical </v>
<v Speaker 1>last time.</v>

461
00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:30.120
<v Speaker 1>So I would say for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look at the Nazis.</v>

462
00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:32.250
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that Nazis were trying</v>

463
00:28:32.251 --> 00:28:35.310
<v Speaker 1>to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a tight ideology and they were</v>

464
00:28:35.311 --> 00:28:36.144
<v Speaker 1>trying to produce a domain that was very</v>
<v Speaker 1>secure and they were sacrificing people </v>

465
00:28:40.711 --> 00:28:44.880
<v Speaker 1>all the time to construct this </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular domain.</v>

466
00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:47.820
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I would say that,</v>

467
00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:52.650
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two reasons possibly to,</v>

468
00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:56.920
<v Speaker 1>to</v>
<v Speaker 1>persecute other people.</v>

469
00:28:57.370 --> 00:29:02.370
<v Speaker 1>One is because they're in your way and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to construct a do a domain</v>

470
00:29:02.921 --> 00:29:06.280
<v Speaker 1>that's secure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you're an explorer,</v>

471
00:29:06.281 --> 00:29:07.114
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you come across another tribe of </v>

472
00:29:10.121 --> 00:29:12.880
<v Speaker 1>people who don't speak your language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while as far as you're concerned,</v>

473
00:29:12.881 --> 00:29:16.630
<v Speaker 1>they're barbarians and your job is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>establish your territory,</v>

474
00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:18.273
<v Speaker 1>but then the other reason for first </v>
<v Speaker 1>accusing other people is because you </v>

475
00:29:21.851 --> 00:29:22.684
<v Speaker 1>enjoy it because there's something </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathological about you and I would say </v>

476
00:29:26.111 --> 00:29:30.430
<v Speaker 1>that the cultural movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to establish new territory</v>

477
00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:37.140
<v Speaker 1>tends to become aligned with individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathology and when that happens,</v>

478
00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:44.250
<v Speaker 1>then you get increased likelihood that </v>
<v Speaker 1>when territory is being established that</v>

479
00:29:45.791 --> 00:29:47.110
<v Speaker 1>people will be persecuted.</v>

480
00:29:47.390 --> 00:29:49.330
<v Speaker 1>So people like the Nazis would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

481
00:29:49.331 --> 00:29:52.720
<v Speaker 1>this is necessary because we want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>establish the third.</v>

482
00:29:52.721 --> 00:29:53.554
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is our particular brand of utopia </v>

483
00:29:54.911 --> 00:29:56.680
<v Speaker 1>on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's their.</v>

484
00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:57.693
<v Speaker 1>That's their justification that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>wear like a uniform so that when they </v>

485
00:30:00.581 --> 00:30:02.660
<v Speaker 1>look at themselves in the mirror and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can tolerate it,</v>

486
00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:07.840
<v Speaker 1>but really what's going on is that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>really liked to hurt people and they can</v>

487
00:30:07.841 --> 00:30:11.620
<v Speaker 1>use the cultural movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is part of the hero's journey.</v>

488
00:30:11.621 --> 00:30:14.740
<v Speaker 1>In a sense to mask that even to </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

489
00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:15.633
<v Speaker 1>So can you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you look at each circle that has </v>

490
00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:21.150
<v Speaker 1>some kind of fortress I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a castle and yeah,</v>

491
00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:22.210
<v Speaker 1>this is a counselor</v>

492
00:30:22.390 --> 00:30:23.223
<v Speaker 3>negatives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you partner likes a track and this </v>

493
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:27.833
<v Speaker 3>and unlikes whatever repel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I mean the positive doesn't let in </v>

494
00:30:30.711 --> 00:30:31.544
<v Speaker 3>the negative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Negative doesn't end with a positive </v>

495
00:30:32.201 --> 00:30:35.140
<v Speaker 3>with positive lead in the positive and </v>
<v Speaker 3>negative 11.</v>

496
00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:36.143
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a reasonable way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at this could easily be </v>

497
00:30:38.341 --> 00:30:42.770
<v Speaker 1>conceptualized as a castle wall here in </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular with would that out,</v>

498
00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:43.733
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this domain being outside the </v>

499
00:30:45.991 --> 00:30:48.450
<v Speaker 1>individual's surrounded by the culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

500
00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:50.940
<v Speaker 1>which is what I was saying with regards </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the great mothers.</v>

501
00:30:50.941 --> 00:30:51.774
<v Speaker 1>You never get to look at this even </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're so well protected by </v>

502
00:30:53.761 --> 00:30:55.140
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't even know what's there.</v>

503
00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:56.753
<v Speaker 1>So it's like in the story of Buddha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Buddha was brought up by his father and </v>

504
00:31:02.131 --> 00:31:05.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on just before Buddhist birth,</v>

505
00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:10.800
<v Speaker 1>a sage told his father that he will need</v>
<v Speaker 1>to grow up to be the world's savior or a</v>

506
00:31:10.801 --> 00:31:11.634
<v Speaker 1>political leader.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And his father wanted him to be a </v>

507
00:31:14.041 --> 00:31:14.874
<v Speaker 1>political leader anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things he did to help </v>

508
00:31:17.911 --> 00:31:18.744
<v Speaker 1>ensure that he would stay in love with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world so that he occupied that </v>

509
00:31:23.551 --> 00:31:24.384
<v Speaker 1>domain was to erect a wall around him </v>
<v Speaker 1>and to put a paradise that means a </v>

510
00:31:29.731 --> 00:31:30.300
<v Speaker 1>walled city.</v>

511
00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:32.730
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's very interesting.</v>

512
00:31:32.731 --> 00:31:37.170
<v Speaker 1>I think to put around Buddha Gautama a </v>
<v Speaker 1>castle wall,</v>

513
00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:38.183
<v Speaker 1>and inside the castle there was nothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was sick or old or in any way </v>

514
00:31:41.911 --> 00:31:42.744
<v Speaker 1>diseased because he didn't want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>become conscious to essentially become </v>

515
00:31:46.981 --> 00:31:51.981
<v Speaker 1>self conscious and to abandon the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's another good.</v>

516
00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:53.183
<v Speaker 1>That's that story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has this structure explicitly like the </v>

517
00:31:56.131 --> 00:32:01.131
<v Speaker 1>great father erects the wall around the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual to protect him or her against</v>

518
00:32:02.041 --> 00:32:05.130
<v Speaker 1>the negative aspect of the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

519
00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:06.563
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the subject matter for </v>

520
00:32:07.771 --> 00:32:11.760
<v Speaker 1>today's discussion basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So okay,</v>

521
00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:13.673
<v Speaker 1>so you're reading use an abusive history</v>
<v Speaker 1>because niche outlines the positive and </v>

522
00:32:16.411 --> 00:32:17.880
<v Speaker 1>the negative aspects of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>History.</v>

523
00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:21.330
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to ask you something about</v>

524
00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:22.283
<v Speaker 1>what you said about what your friends </v>
<v Speaker 1>said about the world being better off </v>

525
00:32:24.751 --> 00:32:25.584
<v Speaker 1>without people because that that seems </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be sort of a strange and really </v>

526
00:32:29.041 --> 00:32:29.874
<v Speaker 1>meaningless projection because without </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of an emperor of a more sizing of </v>

527
00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:39.560
<v Speaker 1>the state of the world because without,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without people,</v>

528
00:32:39.561 --> 00:32:39.990
<v Speaker 1>but world</v>

529
00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:40.823
<v Speaker 4>could not be said to be better or worse </v>
<v Speaker 4>in any way whatsoever beyond completely </v>

530
00:32:47.421 --> 00:32:48.930
<v Speaker 4>meaningless.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

531
00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:50.750
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that's why I</v>

532
00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:53.480
<v Speaker 1>immediately look for turtle alternative </v>
<v Speaker 1>motive,</v>

533
00:32:55.370 --> 00:32:58.700
<v Speaker 1>especially given his ancestry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which isn't to say that there's anything</v>

534
00:32:58.790 --> 00:33:01.760
<v Speaker 1>peculiar about journalists necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>just that it's not far.</v>

535
00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:06.080
<v Speaker 1>We're not far enough away from what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened in the Second World War for the</v>

536
00:33:06.081 --> 00:33:06.914
<v Speaker 1>reasons for what happened to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>disappeared or changed in any </v>

537
00:33:09.591 --> 00:33:10.424
<v Speaker 1>significant way whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's another reason why trying to work </v>

538
00:33:13.851 --> 00:33:16.400
<v Speaker 1>with this material.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the introduction of the book,</v>

539
00:33:16.401 --> 00:33:17.234
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I tried to point out </v>
<v Speaker 1>was the fact that we don't know what to </v>

540
00:33:20.451 --> 00:33:21.284
<v Speaker 1>remember about the Holocaust or what to </v>
<v Speaker 1>change in our behavior as a consequence </v>

541
00:33:24.681 --> 00:33:25.514
<v Speaker 1>of its occurrence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's only happened not even yesterday </v>

542
00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:29.990
<v Speaker 1>and we're still the same people that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>were.</v>

543
00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:34.120
<v Speaker 1>So when he says that the planet would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>better off without people on it,</v>

544
00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:35.780
<v Speaker 1>then I immediately wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

545
00:33:36.010 --> 00:33:39.260
<v Speaker 1>just precisely what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what's your real motivation?</v>

546
00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:43.080
<v Speaker 1>His motivation is something like there </v>
<v Speaker 1>are</v>

547
00:33:43.150 --> 00:33:43.983
<v Speaker 4>people are tainted intrinsically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so badly that the only solution to the </v>

548
00:33:49.121 --> 00:33:53.530
<v Speaker 4>problem of their existence and to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>problem they posed to nature.</v>

549
00:33:53.531 --> 00:33:55.420
<v Speaker 4>So to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that below there,</v>

550
00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:59.260
<v Speaker 4>the fact that they are our nature is to </v>
<v Speaker 4>rid the planet of the.</v>

551
00:33:59.590 --> 00:34:03.130
<v Speaker 4>Now you might think that's making a lot </v>
<v Speaker 4>out of an offhand statement,</v>

552
00:34:03.131 --> 00:34:03.964
<v Speaker 4>but the point is that people do act very</v>
<v Speaker 4>often as if they're motivated by </v>

553
00:34:07.571 --> 00:34:12.250
<v Speaker 4>precisely that set of motivations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So here you've got the identification of</v>

554
00:34:12.251 --> 00:34:15.550
<v Speaker 4>the positive aspect of the individual </v>
<v Speaker 4>with the positive aspect of the unknown.</v>

555
00:34:15.910 --> 00:34:16.743
<v Speaker 4>Because if you're saying that he wants </v>
<v Speaker 4>to destroy somebody who wants to save </v>

556
00:34:22.841 --> 00:34:23.674
<v Speaker 4>nature,</v>

557
00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:25.393
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

558
00:34:27.970 --> 00:34:28.331
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

559
00:34:28.331 --> 00:34:29.810
<v Speaker 4>what if one of these reacting against </v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

560
00:34:29.830 --> 00:34:32.200
<v Speaker 4>essentially the negative aspect of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>great father,</v>

561
00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:34.450
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which essentially,</v>

562
00:34:34.910 --> 00:34:36.910
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but which is composed of all of the,</v>

563
00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:40.150
<v Speaker 4>as you were saying about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>identification of the negative aspect of</v>

564
00:34:40.151 --> 00:34:42.130
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the individual with the,</v>

565
00:34:42.610 --> 00:34:43.460
<v Speaker 4>with the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

566
00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:45.910
<v Speaker 4>negative aspect of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the father.</v>

567
00:34:45.911 --> 00:34:46.744
<v Speaker 4>Then what then what he wants to </v>
<v Speaker 4>eliminate as essentially the negative </v>

568
00:34:48.791 --> 00:34:49.624
<v Speaker 4>aspect of the father.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the reason you would do that would </v>

569
00:34:52.331 --> 00:34:55.680
<v Speaker 4>be for the sake of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the positive individual and there.</v>

570
00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:58.900
<v Speaker 4>And it seems to me that then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then to project that on bias in terms of</v>

571
00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:01.690
<v Speaker 4>just you're trying to save the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is nature.</v>

572
00:35:01.691 --> 00:35:02.524
<v Speaker 4>I think people seem to identify nature </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the positive sense with the positive </v>

573
00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:07.360
<v Speaker 4>in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

574
00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:08.040
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you,</v>

575
00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:09.970
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're making the point essentially that</v>

576
00:35:10.210 --> 00:35:13.040
<v Speaker 4>he was confused in these mythological </v>
<v Speaker 4>precept positions.</v>

577
00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:14.680
<v Speaker 4>Is that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

578
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:16.150
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>possibly.</v>

579
00:35:16.151 --> 00:35:16.780
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just,</v>

580
00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:18.190
<v Speaker 4>it seems to me that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

581
00:35:18.191 --> 00:35:19.890
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the idea that there is some,</v>

582
00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:25.210
<v Speaker 4>the God that has everything everyone has</v>
<v Speaker 4>has in them.</v>

583
00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:27.493
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

584
00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:29.333
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it seems like if you're saying it seems </v>

585
00:35:31.291 --> 00:35:32.124
<v Speaker 4>to be strange,</v>
<v Speaker 4>strangely paradoxical to say that you </v>

586
00:35:33.691 --> 00:35:35.670
<v Speaker 4>want to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to eliminate the human race,</v>

587
00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:38.040
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the of nature because what</v>

588
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:39.960
<v Speaker 1>it really seems to me that you're saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you're,</v>

589
00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:43.530
<v Speaker 1>you want to save what is natural and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

590
00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:44.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

591
00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:45.360
<v Speaker 1>that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I,</v>

592
00:35:45.361 --> 00:35:47.190
<v Speaker 1>that's why I was wondering about </v>
<v Speaker 1>confusion.</v>

593
00:35:48.090 --> 00:35:50.040
<v Speaker 1>Presuppositions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

594
00:35:50.041 --> 00:35:51.140
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

595
00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:52.493
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where to go exactly any </v>

596
00:35:54.871 --> 00:35:57.240
<v Speaker 1>farther with that particular argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

597
00:35:57.900 --> 00:35:58.733
<v Speaker 1>he had.</v>

598
00:36:01.330 --> 00:36:02.163
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what else to say about </v>

599
00:36:03.611 --> 00:36:05.710
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you been saying.</v>

600
00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:07.210
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can you,</v>

601
00:36:07.210 --> 00:36:12.210
<v Speaker 3>can you say that you liked nature and </v>
<v Speaker 3>also say that you want to help the world</v>

602
00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:14.170
<v Speaker 3>because.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

603
00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:15.280
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could you be lying in?</v>

604
00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:16.170
<v Speaker 3>He could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he could.</v>

605
00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:18.040
<v Speaker 3>When he says he wants to save the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could you actually say,</v>

606
00:36:18.070 --> 00:36:19.330
<v Speaker 3>I want to kill a bunch of people?</v>

607
00:36:19.490 --> 00:36:20.450
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

608
00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:21.820
<v Speaker 1>Certainly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

609
00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:22.773
<v Speaker 1>And then it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the best excuse for killing a </v>

610
00:36:24.801 --> 00:36:29.510
<v Speaker 1>bunch of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the one that if you adopt,</v>

611
00:36:29.511 --> 00:36:34.511
<v Speaker 1>makes you tolerable to yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I suppose it would always be the case</v>

612
00:36:34.701 --> 00:36:36.780
<v Speaker 1>in a sense because if you're saving your</v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

613
00:36:36.830 --> 00:36:39.320
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I in in terms of what we're talking,</v>

614
00:36:39.850 --> 00:36:40.683
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

615
00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:41.903
<v Speaker 1>it's a logical justification,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which perhaps upon occasion is even </v>

616
00:36:46.911 --> 00:36:47.744
<v Speaker 1>true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also the kind of justification </v>

617
00:36:50.661 --> 00:36:55.661
<v Speaker 1>that can easily and rapidly be twisted </v>
<v Speaker 1>for your own particular nasty and see.</v>

618
00:36:55.790 --> 00:36:56.623
<v Speaker 1>Because one of the things that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting about war is the fact that </v>

619
00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:05.380
<v Speaker 1>people will commit crimes in the course </v>
<v Speaker 1>of work there that go beyond</v>

620
00:37:10.850 --> 00:37:15.850
<v Speaker 1>the don't actually help the cause of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>war in any particular manner.</v>

621
00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:20.540
<v Speaker 1>And not only that undermine necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that,</v>

622
00:37:20.541 --> 00:37:22.570
<v Speaker 1>that person is theoretically fighting </v>
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>

623
00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:24.860
<v Speaker 1>Like one of the things that springs to </v>
<v Speaker 1>my mind is,</v>

624
00:37:24.861 --> 00:37:27.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the plan rape of the Muslim women in,</v>

625
00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:28.663
<v Speaker 1>in what used to be Yugoslavia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it takes that particularly the </v>

626
00:37:32.181 --> 00:37:37.181
<v Speaker 1>justification that we are just </v>
<v Speaker 1>establishing our own secure territory is</v>

627
00:37:37.341 --> 00:37:41.150
<v Speaker 1>not sufficient to motivate the planning </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that kind of event.</v>

628
00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:45.950
<v Speaker 1>You need some other little bent twist to</v>
<v Speaker 1>come up with something that,</v>

629
00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:50.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it brilliantly cruel.</v>

630
00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:55.130
<v Speaker 1>And anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm discussing this in part as a,</v>

631
00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:56.653
<v Speaker 1>what would you call a precursor to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole last section of this particular </v>

632
00:37:59.781 --> 00:38:03.440
<v Speaker 1>course because one of the things we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to discuss in detail is the nature</v>

633
00:38:03.441 --> 00:38:07.910
<v Speaker 1>of that additional twisted motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We haven't talked anything about this at</v>

634
00:38:07.911 --> 00:38:08.710
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

635
00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:12.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah.</v>

636
00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:13.383
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm trying to understand what you </v>

637
00:38:15.041 --> 00:38:20.041
<v Speaker 3>just said is the only way that you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can justify rape is not only to,</v>

638
00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:28.730
<v Speaker 3>for the war to be a warring over land </v>
<v Speaker 3>but also over this objective territory.</v>

639
00:38:31.890 --> 00:38:33.270
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would think if you,</v>

640
00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:37.150
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if whole land women were to be raped,</v>

641
00:38:37.450 --> 00:38:39.250
<v Speaker 3>that would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it obviously affects</v>

642
00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:41.773
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It brings down the morale of the women </v>

643
00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:44.973
<v Speaker 3>that were raped and also the community,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the community because when that </v>

644
00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:48.063
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's not really a material gain when </v>

645
00:38:52.090 --> 00:38:53.180
<v Speaker 3>but also an emotional.</v>

646
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:54.850
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

647
00:38:54.890 --> 00:38:55.723
<v Speaker 1>I would say under most conditions it </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be the reverse because I think </v>

648
00:38:57.880 --> 00:38:58.713
<v Speaker 1>like if you want to defeat someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think anything you can do to them </v>

649
00:39:02.231 --> 00:39:07.231
<v Speaker 1>that's gratuitously cruel likely only </v>
<v Speaker 1>heightens their will to resist.</v>

650
00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:11.570
<v Speaker 1>So I think it works as if it actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>would work as something</v>

651
00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:17.270
<v Speaker 1>counterproductive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

652
00:39:17.330 --> 00:39:18.163
<v Speaker 1>I want to leave this because we'll get </v>
<v Speaker 1>back to this in detail later in the </v>

653
00:39:20.241 --> 00:39:21.074
<v Speaker 1>course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

654
00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:21.973
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is just sort of a preview and it </v>

655
00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:26.990
<v Speaker 1>says I want to get your mind thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this other.</v>

656
00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:28.303
<v Speaker 1>Because the law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you see we don't take </v>

657
00:39:29.541 --> 00:39:31.790
<v Speaker 1>into account,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is true in general psychology I</v>

658
00:39:31.791 --> 00:39:32.624
<v Speaker 1>think is we have a hard time coming to </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms with more complex base </v>

659
00:39:36.411 --> 00:39:38.330
<v Speaker 1>motivations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we don't.</v>

660
00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:39.223
<v Speaker 1>We're not very good at conceptualizing </v>
<v Speaker 1>things like a cleaning fee undertaken </v>

661
00:39:43.851 --> 00:39:45.320
<v Speaker 1>for aesthetic purposes.</v>

662
00:39:46.610 --> 00:39:49.250
<v Speaker 1>So we can't really come to grips with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

663
00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:51.560
<v Speaker 1>Like even when we talk about antisocial </v>
<v Speaker 1>personalities,</v>

664
00:39:51.561 --> 00:39:52.880
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we tend to.</v>

665
00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:56.060
<v Speaker 1>We don't tend to think about it in terms</v>
<v Speaker 1>of some sort of.</v>

666
00:39:57.020 --> 00:39:59.360
<v Speaker 1>All the evil is being taken out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>

667
00:39:59.361 --> 00:40:01.730
<v Speaker 1>It's something that's just a matter of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

668
00:40:01.850 --> 00:40:05.870
<v Speaker 1>say heightened approach systems and </v>
<v Speaker 1>reduced response to anxiety and so on.</v>

669
00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:07.063
<v Speaker 1>There's a whole set of complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivations were not very good at like </v>

670
00:40:09.171 --> 00:40:12.230
<v Speaker 1>the desire to kill things to hurt </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

671
00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:14.810
<v Speaker 1>We don't know how to deal with that or </v>
<v Speaker 1>how they conceptualize it.</v>

672
00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:16.550
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to talk about that,</v>

673
00:40:16.551 --> 00:40:18.750
<v Speaker 1>but there's also taken out of that also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

674
00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:21.440
<v Speaker 1>The more complex positive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the complex positive,</v>

675
00:40:21.441 --> 00:40:24.350
<v Speaker 1>like maybe their desire to learn from </v>
<v Speaker 1>pushing the borders.</v>

676
00:40:25.010 --> 00:40:26.160
<v Speaker 1>Possibly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

677
00:40:27.890 --> 00:40:28.723
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the structure of scientific </v>

678
00:40:30.291 --> 00:40:31.124
<v Speaker 1>revolutions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want you to read that because what </v>

679
00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:35.600
<v Speaker 1>killing discovered with regards to </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific revolutions,</v>

680
00:40:35.601 --> 00:40:37.850
<v Speaker 1>I think is just just get beyond good and</v>
<v Speaker 1>evil.</v>

681
00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:39.070
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

682
00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:42.620
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beyond good and evil,</v>

683
00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:43.653
<v Speaker 1>I would like you to read because me and </v>
<v Speaker 1>she wrote it after Western culture had </v>

684
00:40:52.371 --> 00:40:53.204
<v Speaker 1>moved into an intervening period of </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos as a consequence of the loss of </v>

685
00:40:57.381 --> 00:41:02.381
<v Speaker 1>its religious foundations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you could say that when there's,</v>

686
00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:05.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bouncing ball diagram,</v>

687
00:41:05.181 --> 00:41:08.240
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Western culture,</v>

688
00:41:09.010 --> 00:41:12.470
<v Speaker 1>the religious presuppositions of western</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture will were shattered.</v>

689
00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:18.080
<v Speaker 1>There was an intervening period of time </v>
<v Speaker 1>where morality as such had unspecified,</v>

690
00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:18.983
<v Speaker 1>an unspecified reason for being a niche.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was trying to explore the nature of </v>

691
00:41:24.711 --> 00:41:28.550
<v Speaker 1>what used to be taken for granted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was the existence of the religious</v>

692
00:41:28.551 --> 00:41:33.551
<v Speaker 1>structure and the possibilities for </v>
<v Speaker 1>reconstructing an alternative morality.</v>

693
00:41:34.401 --> 00:41:39.401
<v Speaker 1>I suppose that would be rationally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>irrationally comprehensive.</v>

694
00:41:42.290 --> 00:41:43.123
<v Speaker 1>I guess the reason I want you to read </v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond good and evil war particularly </v>

695
00:41:46.101 --> 00:41:48.740
<v Speaker 1>those because reading that should do to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

696
00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:54.470
<v Speaker 1>It's like an initiation ritual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess in a sense that's intellectually</v>

697
00:41:54.471 --> 00:41:56.630
<v Speaker 1>produced because nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said himself,</v>

698
00:41:56.631 --> 00:41:57.464
<v Speaker 1>he philosophize with a hammer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His point was to break down </v>

699
00:42:00.501 --> 00:42:01.334
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what he wanted to do for a </v>

700
00:42:03.831 --> 00:42:07.700
<v Speaker 1>defined end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to release the will power,</v>

701
00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:09.680
<v Speaker 1>I suppose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or to make people aware of it.</v>

702
00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:10.573
<v Speaker 1>And I would say what the will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the will to power could be most </v>

703
00:42:12.651 --> 00:42:13.484
<v Speaker 1>accurately conceptualized in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that allows people to continue </v>

704
00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.230
<v Speaker 1>continually erect structures of nod,</v>
<v Speaker 1>break them down and redirect them.</v>

705
00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:23.230
<v Speaker 1>I think that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what nature striving.</v>

706
00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:25.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's difficult to see what he was</v>

707
00:42:25.851 --> 00:42:28.010
<v Speaker 1>driving out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there'd be lots of debate about that.</v>

708
00:42:28.011 --> 00:42:28.844
<v Speaker 1>But beyond good and evil is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is useful to read for a number of </v>

709
00:42:31.461 --> 00:42:32.510
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

710
00:42:32.511 --> 00:42:34.730
<v Speaker 1>you'll never find another book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in your whole life.</v>

711
00:42:34.731 --> 00:42:36.070
<v Speaker 1>That's so unfair.</v>

712
00:42:36.090 --> 00:42:36.923
<v Speaker 1>It's so remarkable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brilliant Nature said that he wanted to </v>

713
00:42:39.981 --> 00:42:43.160
<v Speaker 1>write in a sentence what other people </v>
<v Speaker 1>could not write in a book.</v>

714
00:42:43.610 --> 00:42:47.750
<v Speaker 1>And I think that he accomplished that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly with beyond good and evil.</v>

715
00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:52.580
<v Speaker 1>Every sentence is a thought and most of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the thoughts are brilliant and there are</v>

716
00:42:52.581 --> 00:42:57.530
<v Speaker 1>many books that have one thought in them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not even such a good thought.</v>

717
00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:01.850
<v Speaker 1>So it's also pretty useful from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>stylistic perspective because nature was</v>

718
00:43:01.851 --> 00:43:02.684
<v Speaker 1>a master,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a literary master and reading him can </v>

719
00:43:05.271 --> 00:43:08.750
<v Speaker 1>help clear up your thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's amazingly clear thinker.</v>

720
00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:12.640
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so those are the reasons for.</v>

721
00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:16.050
<v Speaker 1>He's also questioning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see nature,</v>

722
00:43:16.070 --> 00:43:16.903
<v Speaker 1>you said that he was the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosopher who didn't set out a </v>

723
00:43:20.241 --> 00:43:25.241
<v Speaker 1>priority to prove that a particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>morality that already existed was true.</v>

724
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.070
<v Speaker 1>Like Nisha said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look up to me.</v>

725
00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:29.233
<v Speaker 1>Every western philosopher has worked </v>
<v Speaker 1>within an established moral system and </v>

726
00:43:33.981 --> 00:43:34.814
<v Speaker 1>only attempted to justify it even though</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't know that's what they were </v>

727
00:43:37.101 --> 00:43:37.934
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

728
00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:42.290
<v Speaker 1>He thought that he was the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosopher in history who is capable of</v>

729
00:43:42.291 --> 00:43:43.124
<v Speaker 1>saying of seeing that alternative </v>
<v Speaker 1>realities existed everywhere and that's </v>

730
00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:50.900
<v Speaker 1>the fact of morality had become a </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

731
00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:56.560
<v Speaker 1>Why is the morality not which morality </v>
<v Speaker 1>is right even or that are particular?</v>

732
00:43:56.931 --> 00:44:00.530
<v Speaker 1>Morality isn't necessarily right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why is the morality and Ken,</v>

733
00:44:00.531 --> 00:44:01.364
<v Speaker 1>they're justifiably the morality?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there any reason for presuming that </v>

734
00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:05.383
<v Speaker 1>the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is good and what is evil is even </v>

735
00:44:07.630 --> 00:44:11.300
<v Speaker 1>worth asking or answering or has any </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable answer?</v>

736
00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:12.493
<v Speaker 1>Those are all questions he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>attempting to address because Nietzsche </v>

737
00:44:14.721 --> 00:44:15.554
<v Speaker 1>believed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you knock the god out of a religious </v>

738
00:44:17.271 --> 00:44:18.104
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a moral system that the entire </v>

739
00:44:20.031 --> 00:44:23.060
<v Speaker 1>moral system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>therefore it no longer has any reason to</v>

740
00:44:23.061 --> 00:44:25.400
<v Speaker 1>exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if it has no reason to exist,</v>

741
00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:27.830
<v Speaker 1>it will disappear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quite take hundreds of years,</v>

742
00:44:28.730 --> 00:44:29.563
<v Speaker 1>but it will disappear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's why he said God is dead and </v>

743
00:44:34.231 --> 00:44:37.590
<v Speaker 1>we have killed him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He also said to finish that phrase off,</v>

744
00:44:37.591 --> 00:44:38.424
<v Speaker 1>that we will have a difficult time </v>
<v Speaker 1>finding enough water to wash away all </v>

745
00:44:41.671 --> 00:44:42.504
<v Speaker 1>the blood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was his prophecy for the 20th </v>

746
00:44:44.281 --> 00:44:47.240
<v Speaker 1>century and the part of the quote that </v>
<v Speaker 1>many people do not,</v>

747
00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:49.830
<v Speaker 1>don't realize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Photos.</v>

748
00:44:49.870 --> 00:44:50.703
<v Speaker 1>The first part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was attempting to address the </v>

749
00:44:53.641 --> 00:44:55.320
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we lost our religious belief,</v>

750
00:44:55.530 --> 00:44:56.363
<v Speaker 1>so now what did we do for morality?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's worth it's worth reading for a </v>

751
00:45:00.391 --> 00:45:03.300
<v Speaker 1>number of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The structure of scientific revolutions,</v>

752
00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:05.760
<v Speaker 1>Thomas Kuhn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>discovered,</v>

753
00:45:07.070 --> 00:45:10.490
<v Speaker 5>don't be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't mean to imply by that,</v>

754
00:45:10.491 --> 00:45:11.324
<v Speaker 5>that before when we were in western </v>
<v Speaker 5>society had thought there was any less </v>

755
00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:15.513
<v Speaker 5>fortunate.</v>

756
00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:18.653
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's a complicated question </v>

757
00:45:19.441 --> 00:45:24.000
<v Speaker 1>because part of it's technical </v>
<v Speaker 1>technologically technologically relate.</v>

758
00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:25.463
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

759
00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:29.400
<v Speaker 5>Would that be</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

760
00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:30.443
<v Speaker 5>No Way.</v>

761
00:45:31.310 --> 00:45:34.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean to imply that I don't think</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably he meant to imply it either,</v>

762
00:45:34.221 --> 00:45:37.100
<v Speaker 1>but his point I think was more </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly that</v>

763
00:45:38.660 --> 00:45:39.493
<v Speaker 1>the demise of fixed religious systems </v>
<v Speaker 1>would necessarily mean that the </v>

764
00:45:43.490 --> 00:45:47.210
<v Speaker 1>conflicts of the 20th century would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideologically motivated,</v>

765
00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:52.220
<v Speaker 1>specifically ideologically motivated as </v>
<v Speaker 1>annuity ologies rose up to try to occupy</v>

766
00:45:52.221 --> 00:45:53.054
<v Speaker 1>the territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That previous ideology or religion </v>

767
00:45:56.451 --> 00:45:58.700
<v Speaker 1>really hasn't been any allergy because </v>
<v Speaker 1>most of them,</v>

768
00:45:59.210 --> 00:46:03.380
<v Speaker 1>most of our religion is implicit and </v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the ideologies exploits it.</v>

769
00:46:03.381 --> 00:46:05.280
<v Speaker 1>I think because someone actually wrote </v>
<v Speaker 1>it down,</v>

770
00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:06.890
<v Speaker 1>call it Karma isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

771
00:46:06.891 --> 00:46:07.724
<v Speaker 1>is more likely to a sense more like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific system because all the </v>

772
00:46:09.291 --> 00:46:13.880
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions are actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>are actually explicit,</v>

773
00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:17.060
<v Speaker 1>so I think there's some reason for </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinguishing niche.</v>

774
00:46:17.070 --> 00:46:17.903
<v Speaker 1>You thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well these new ideologies would </v>

775
00:46:18.511 --> 00:46:19.344
<v Speaker 1>necessarily rise up to who occupied the </v>
<v Speaker 1>position of ideology and that we'd see </v>

776
00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:25.790
<v Speaker 1>more fair on a grand scale in Europe as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a consequence of that.</v>

777
00:46:26.310 --> 00:46:29.810
<v Speaker 1>So no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's not reasonable to say that.</v>

778
00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:35.630
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to say know because people </v>
<v Speaker 1>compare what Stalin did,</v>

779
00:46:35.631 --> 00:46:37.340
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the name of videology,</v>

780
00:46:37.341 --> 00:46:38.174
<v Speaker 1>to what the Catholic Church didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spain during the period of the </v>

781
00:46:41.331 --> 00:46:42.164
<v Speaker 1>inquisition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The inquisition was nowhere near as </v>

782
00:46:45.830 --> 00:46:46.663
<v Speaker 1>horrifying as the Stalinist purges,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's difficult to tell if that's </v>

783
00:46:50.481 --> 00:46:51.314
<v Speaker 1>because the motivation different or </v>
<v Speaker 1>because by the time of stolen the </v>

784
00:46:54.741 --> 00:46:59.741
<v Speaker 1>technology for implementing inquisition </v>
<v Speaker 1>like procedures were so far advanced,</v>

785
00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:01.303
<v Speaker 1>so</v>
<v Speaker 1>solzhenitsyn believed the Stalinist </v>

786
00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:10.270
<v Speaker 1>purges were worse than anything that had</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened in Russia,</v>

787
00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:13.370
<v Speaker 1>his previous history under the czar and </v>
<v Speaker 1>worse than this,</v>

788
00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:16.610
<v Speaker 1>the inquisition as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>

789
00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:20.980
<v Speaker 1>there's this complicating technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't know what to say about that.</v>

790
00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:21.913
<v Speaker 1>Precisely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think people have probably </v>

791
00:47:24.741 --> 00:47:25.574
<v Speaker 1>changed that much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so have the people who ran the Spanish </v>

792
00:47:29.531 --> 00:47:32.080
<v Speaker 1>inquisition had access to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>

793
00:47:32.081 --> 00:47:35.110
<v Speaker 1>the product just this horrible.</v>

794
00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:37.863
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For the structure of scientific </v>

795
00:47:38.681 --> 00:47:39.880
<v Speaker 1>revolutions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kuhn</v>

796
00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:42.533
<v Speaker 1>couldn't basically attempts to </v>
<v Speaker 1>demonstrate that this bouncing ball </v>

797
00:47:47.110 --> 00:47:50.110
<v Speaker 1>diagram also applies in the scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>domain.</v>

798
00:47:51.690 --> 00:47:52.523
<v Speaker 1>That's not exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He attempted to say that a process like </v>

799
00:47:57.041 --> 00:48:02.041
<v Speaker 1>this applied in the scientific domain</v>
<v Speaker 1>without necessarily considering the fact</v>

800
00:48:02.351 --> 00:48:05.080
<v Speaker 1>that it might characterize all cognitive</v>
<v Speaker 1>revolutions,</v>

801
00:48:05.081 --> 00:48:07.570
<v Speaker 1>including those that operate in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>domain of morality.</v>

802
00:48:08.110 --> 00:48:08.943
<v Speaker 1>The reason I want you to read this book </v>
<v Speaker 1>is because one of the risks of the </v>

803
00:48:11.501 --> 00:48:16.501
<v Speaker 1>approach that I take in this class is </v>
<v Speaker 1>over reliance on a few sources.</v>

804
00:48:16.661 --> 00:48:18.760
<v Speaker 1>I tend to rely heavily on you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

805
00:48:19.250 --> 00:48:20.083
<v Speaker 1>and that's partly because they're the </v>
<v Speaker 1>only people that I know who actually </v>

806
00:48:23.021 --> 00:48:23.854
<v Speaker 1>deal with this material.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think it's so much narrower </v>

807
00:48:25.881 --> 00:48:26.714
<v Speaker 1>as just lack of options.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I wanted you to read Kuhn because </v>

808
00:48:29.850 --> 00:48:30.940
<v Speaker 1>you've.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that way you can.</v>

809
00:48:30.990 --> 00:48:32.690
<v Speaker 1>That's a book that was very well </v>
<v Speaker 1>received.</v>

810
00:48:32.690 --> 00:48:33.523
<v Speaker 1>They made become world famous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was published in I think 1960 in </v>

811
00:48:35.941 --> 00:48:37.990
<v Speaker 1>1962.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

812
00:48:39.570 --> 00:48:40.403
<v Speaker 1>I want you to see for yourself that </v>
<v Speaker 1>these sorts of ideas appear relevant in </v>

813
00:48:46.470 --> 00:48:47.303
<v Speaker 1>other fields and have been discovered by</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people who are working from </v>

814
00:48:51.301 --> 00:48:52.134
<v Speaker 1>entirely different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from entirely different set of </v>

815
00:48:54.091 --> 00:48:54.924
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also because you have such a </v>

816
00:48:57.481 --> 00:48:58.314
<v Speaker 1>terrible academic reputation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I can on and on actually </v>

817
00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:08.200
<v Speaker 1>understanding to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to allow you to see for yourself that an</v>

818
00:49:08.491 --> 00:49:09.324
<v Speaker 1>idea that made kill and world famous and</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 1960 was positive 30 or 40 years </v>

819
00:49:14.161 --> 00:49:18.390
<v Speaker 1>earlier by you on a much broader scale </v>
<v Speaker 1>and was as far as I can tell,</v>

820
00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:22.470
<v Speaker 1>more or less completely overlooked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why that is.</v>

821
00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:27.300
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the devils.</v>

822
00:49:28.860 --> 00:49:31.230
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Devil's paradise lost notes from the</v>

823
00:49:31.231 --> 00:49:32.064
<v Speaker 1>underground and the Gulag archipelago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll make a unit and the unit is a </v>

824
00:49:35.881 --> 00:49:40.881
<v Speaker 1>discussion of the negative aspect of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual paradise lost.</v>

825
00:49:41.950 --> 00:49:44.460
<v Speaker 1>This is the first time I've used this </v>
<v Speaker 1>book in this course.</v>

826
00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:46.433
<v Speaker 1>Paradise lost is the story of the fall </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the devil from having now what he </v>

827
00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:55.020
<v Speaker 1>tried to do while he tried to do two </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

828
00:49:55.021 --> 00:49:57.870
<v Speaker 1>he said he was trying to justify the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways of God to man,</v>

829
00:49:58.290 --> 00:50:01.920
<v Speaker 1>which is an amazingly ambitious project.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

830
00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:06.980
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing that someone would take it </v>
<v Speaker 1>upon themselves to too seriously conduct</v>

831
00:50:07.171 --> 00:50:08.004
<v Speaker 1>an enterprise like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But also what he did was there's a kind </v>

832
00:50:12.121 --> 00:50:13.740
<v Speaker 1>of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

833
00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:14.933
<v Speaker 1>remember I used the example and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want it to think about what art </v>

834
00:50:17.881 --> 00:50:18.714
<v Speaker 1>and mythology does with relationship to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the construction of knowledge that you </v>

835
00:50:21.841 --> 00:50:22.674
<v Speaker 1>might think that if you think of culture</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an island and the processes around </v>

836
00:50:27.651 --> 00:50:28.484
<v Speaker 1>the edge of the island being </v>
<v Speaker 1>qualitatively different from those in </v>

837
00:50:30.621 --> 00:50:33.520
<v Speaker 1>the Middle Myth and art sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>circulate around outside,</v>

838
00:50:33.830 --> 00:50:36.260
<v Speaker 1>say as information goes more towards the</v>
<v Speaker 1>center,</v>

839
00:50:36.261 --> 00:50:37.094
<v Speaker 1>tends to give,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take more on the shape of Dogma or </v>

840
00:50:39.111 --> 00:50:41.420
<v Speaker 1>codified knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and on the outside it's less,</v>

841
00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:46.510
<v Speaker 1>it's more amorphous and it seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>contained more an image that's,</v>

842
00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:48.350
<v Speaker 1>that's my impression anyways.</v>

843
00:50:48.700 --> 00:50:50.180
<v Speaker 1>Last verbal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more image.</v>

844
00:50:50.330 --> 00:50:51.163
<v Speaker 1>The farther out it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our at the farthest reaches its still </v>

845
00:50:53.751 --> 00:50:56.060
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in ritual and seemed invitation.</v>

846
00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:57.680
<v Speaker 1>Don't even really have an image of it </v>
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>

847
00:50:57.710 --> 00:51:01.310
<v Speaker 1>You just acted out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only can you not talk about it,</v>

848
00:51:01.311 --> 00:51:03.950
<v Speaker 1>you can't form an accurate image of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can still act about.</v>

849
00:51:03.970 --> 00:51:04.803
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what Milton did was to collect a myth </v>

850
00:51:08.690 --> 00:51:13.040
<v Speaker 1>that have formed around the central core</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Christianity.</v>

851
00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:14.173
<v Speaker 1>And to give it a more or less formal </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure and the math is the notion </v>

852
00:51:17.991 --> 00:51:22.850
<v Speaker 1>that there is a rebellion in heaven and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the devil fell.</v>

853
00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:25.760
<v Speaker 1>Who was God's highest angel?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of his two sons.</v>

854
00:51:25.761 --> 00:51:28.090
<v Speaker 1>I guess one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other one being Christ say to be the</v>

855
00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:28.933
<v Speaker 1>oldest son rebelled against God in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>attempt to occupy this position and was </v>

856
00:51:33.621 --> 00:51:35.270
<v Speaker 1>cast into hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

857
00:51:35.271 --> 00:51:36.104
<v Speaker 1>it's an interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a story that has always running </v>

858
00:51:38.090 --> 00:51:41.960
<v Speaker 1>around in my mind for some peculiar </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>

859
00:51:42.650 --> 00:51:44.600
<v Speaker 1>Lucifer means light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bringer,</v>

860
00:51:45.260 --> 00:51:49.100
<v Speaker 1>and Lucifer is the agent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness,</v>

861
00:51:49.101 --> 00:51:50.840
<v Speaker 1>even in genesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As far as that,</v>

862
00:51:50.841 --> 00:51:55.841
<v Speaker 1>that's my particular take on it anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As Lucifer is the serpent who gives both</v>

863
00:51:56.120 --> 00:51:56.953
<v Speaker 1>eve and Adam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the apple that makes them self </v>

864
00:51:59.271 --> 00:52:00.104
<v Speaker 1>conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He brings them to the light and the </v>

865
00:52:01.761 --> 00:52:02.594
<v Speaker 1>Bible represents that as a catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously people get thrown out of </v>

866
00:52:05.870 --> 00:52:08.330
<v Speaker 1>paradise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's some split.</v>

867
00:52:08.331 --> 00:52:09.770
<v Speaker 1>There was apparently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>according to young,</v>

868
00:52:09.771 --> 00:52:11.840
<v Speaker 1>there's even split in the Medieval </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity,</v>

869
00:52:12.070 --> 00:52:12.903
<v Speaker 1>the the absolute negative quality of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that particular event because it was </v>

870
00:52:17.091 --> 00:52:17.924
<v Speaker 1>also regarded as a fortunate error </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the fact that Adam and Eve got </v>

871
00:52:22.131 --> 00:52:22.964
<v Speaker 1>kicked out of paradise provided the </v>
<v Speaker 1>precondition for the necessary </v>

872
00:52:25.911 --> 00:52:28.070
<v Speaker 1>appearance of Christ who is a savior or </v>
<v Speaker 1>hero.</v>

873
00:52:28.610 --> 00:52:33.590
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm interested.</v>

874
00:52:35.930 --> 00:52:36.763
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity took the discussion at the </v>

875
00:52:38.961 --> 00:52:43.190
<v Speaker 1>devil and his nature farther than any </v>
<v Speaker 1>other form of religion has ever taken.</v>

876
00:52:43.191 --> 00:52:48.191
<v Speaker 1>The discussion of of evil could say that</v>
<v Speaker 1>for us to conceptualize,</v>

877
00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:53.710
<v Speaker 1>say as a culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have been trying to abstract out from</v>

878
00:52:54.501 --> 00:52:55.334
<v Speaker 1>our general behaviors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pattern that characterized as evil </v>

879
00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:05.500
<v Speaker 1>ever since we attempted to map who we </v>
<v Speaker 1>were has a conscious endeavor.</v>

880
00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:06.583
<v Speaker 1>Which is to say that we've taken 10 tens</v>
<v Speaker 1>of thousands of years to try to come to </v>

881
00:53:10.641 --> 00:53:13.930
<v Speaker 1>grips with the essential nature of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavioral pattern,</v>

882
00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:16.090
<v Speaker 1>their attitude pattern that characterize</v>
<v Speaker 1>as evil.</v>

883
00:53:16.730 --> 00:53:17.563
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we obviously still don't have a very </v>

884
00:53:19.041 --> 00:53:19.874
<v Speaker 1>good verbal description of what that </v>
<v Speaker 1>means because you can't just go up to </v>

885
00:53:22.341 --> 00:53:23.960
<v Speaker 1>your neighbor and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

886
00:53:24.140 --> 00:53:24.973
<v Speaker 1>spoke me off a paragraph or two that </v>
<v Speaker 1>will define the boundaries of behavior </v>

887
00:53:30.061 --> 00:53:32.370
<v Speaker 1>that would generally be recognized as </v>
<v Speaker 1>evil.</v>

888
00:53:32.430 --> 00:53:33.690
<v Speaker 1>We don't know that you say.</v>

889
00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:34.441
<v Speaker 1>You could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

890
00:53:34.441 --> 00:53:35.274
<v Speaker 1>I knew it when I see it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means that it's still kind of </v>

891
00:53:37.501 --> 00:53:38.334
<v Speaker 1>implicit knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that the idea of the devil </v>

892
00:53:42.541 --> 00:53:46.560
<v Speaker 1>seemed to have derived from zero astrium</v>
<v Speaker 1>religion.</v>

893
00:53:48.310 --> 00:53:49.143
<v Speaker 1>There's a garden zoroastrianism named </v>
<v Speaker 1>her a Mazda and he has two sons whose </v>

894
00:53:53.281 --> 00:53:56.310
<v Speaker 1>names escape me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the first religion,</v>

895
00:53:56.570 --> 00:54:00.300
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are osteons also believed that the</v>

896
00:54:00.301 --> 00:54:01.134
<v Speaker 1>universe was engaged in an internal </v>
<v Speaker 1>battle between the forces of good and </v>

897
00:54:03.571 --> 00:54:05.430
<v Speaker 1>evil and that they were basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>balanced,</v>

898
00:54:05.431 --> 00:54:08.170
<v Speaker 1>which Christianity didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't exactly dog that.</v>

899
00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:13.660
<v Speaker 1>It's referring to this as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The battle between good neat.</v>

900
00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:18.470
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity's things the end,</v>

901
00:54:18.550 --> 00:54:22.680
<v Speaker 1>he started fuel from the self is there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thereby leaving it to be repressed and.</v>

902
00:54:23.020 --> 00:54:23.761
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something.</v>

903
00:54:23.761 --> 00:54:24.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something that's.</v>

904
00:54:24.750 --> 00:54:25.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing you know,</v>

905
00:54:25.990 --> 00:54:28.940
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of sense in this story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about original?</v>

906
00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:29.831
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

907
00:54:29.831 --> 00:54:30.664
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't a young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that young find out </v>

908
00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:36.780
<v Speaker 1>was that the triumvirate of that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>trinity are there.</v>

909
00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:39.380
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is God is really a fraternity.</v>

910
00:54:39.570 --> 00:54:40.403
<v Speaker 1>The debt and the devil attacks attempts </v>
<v Speaker 1>to eliminate the evil from from the </v>

911
00:54:46.471 --> 00:54:47.191
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

912
00:54:47.191 --> 00:54:50.560
<v Speaker 1>Well that was something that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a particular moment about boat,</v>

913
00:54:50.580 --> 00:54:51.413
<v Speaker 1>about Christianity with because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought that he thought exactly what </v>

914
00:54:55.110 --> 00:54:58.830
<v Speaker 1>Christianity tended to view evil as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>absence of God,</v>

915
00:54:59.100 --> 00:55:03.330
<v Speaker 1>whereas young tended to view it as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an actual presence in and of itself,</v>

916
00:55:03.450 --> 00:55:07.530
<v Speaker 1>something that was complex enough and </v>
<v Speaker 1>solid enough so to speak,</v>

917
00:55:07.531 --> 00:55:08.364
<v Speaker 1>that you couldn't just account for it by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the absence of something good and that </v>

918
00:55:11.821 --> 00:55:12.654
<v Speaker 1>was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose in medieval times that would </v>

919
00:55:15.631 --> 00:55:17.950
<v Speaker 1>be needed as a remarkably heretical </v>
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>

920
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.220
<v Speaker 1>So that was humans particular take on </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

921
00:55:20.490 --> 00:55:21.323
<v Speaker 1>but there are good reasons for believing</v>
<v Speaker 1>the opposite to the to to believe that </v>

922
00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:28.530
<v Speaker 1>evil can be understood as the absence of</v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

923
00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:29.633
<v Speaker 1>That's a real logical argument to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's one that you'll give </v>

924
00:55:31.741 --> 00:55:32.574
<v Speaker 1>enough credence to that is that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>still your presentation is what he </v>

925
00:55:37.051 --> 00:55:38.910
<v Speaker 1>thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

926
00:55:39.020 --> 00:55:44.020
<v Speaker 1>let's get back to this myth</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lucifer's associated with rationality in</v>

927
00:55:48.031 --> 00:55:48.864
<v Speaker 1>Christian mythology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason I want you to read </v>

928
00:55:53.310 --> 00:55:57.570
<v Speaker 1>paradise lost is because I think what </v>
<v Speaker 1>paradise lost is about,</v>

929
00:55:57.630 --> 00:55:58.860
<v Speaker 1>and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

930
00:55:58.861 --> 00:55:59.694
<v Speaker 1>this is pure speculation on my part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is certainly about something that we </v>

931
00:56:03.431 --> 00:56:06.030
<v Speaker 1>know people have been working on </v>
<v Speaker 1>building that myth for a long,</v>

932
00:56:06.031 --> 00:56:07.200
<v Speaker 1>long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>long time.</v>

933
00:56:07.470 --> 00:56:09.420
<v Speaker 1>It's about something but what it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

934
00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:14.070
<v Speaker 1>and I doubt very much if it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>description of empirical reality.</v>

935
00:56:14.700 --> 00:56:15.533
<v Speaker 1>So it's about something else and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>that meant says is that the highest </v>

936
00:56:20.071 --> 00:56:20.904
<v Speaker 1>angel in God's kingdom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I would view as something as a </v>

937
00:56:23.261 --> 00:56:25.300
<v Speaker 1>description of an interest psychic </v>
<v Speaker 1>state,</v>

938
00:56:25.301 --> 00:56:27.430
<v Speaker 1>the place where there are spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

939
00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:32.880
<v Speaker 1>attempted to you serve God's position </v>
<v Speaker 1>which is characterized by omnipotent,</v>

940
00:56:33.300 --> 00:56:34.450
<v Speaker 1>omniscient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>omnipotent,</v>

941
00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:35.970
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was pretty.</v>

942
00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:40.270
<v Speaker 1>The other one is three cardinal </v>
<v Speaker 1>attributes of God should omniscience,</v>

943
00:56:40.271 --> 00:56:42.610
<v Speaker 1>omnipotence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>omnipresence,</v>

944
00:56:42.611 --> 00:56:44.390
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Said,</v>

945
00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:47.920
<v Speaker 1>I can occupy the position of God </v>
<v Speaker 1>instantly.</v>

946
00:56:48.110 --> 00:56:49.650
<v Speaker 1>He's inhale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

947
00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:52.290
<v Speaker 1>I think what that means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is something that from northrop</v>

948
00:56:52.310 --> 00:56:56.440
<v Speaker 1>prior also commented on was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

949
00:56:57.130 --> 00:56:59.320
<v Speaker 1>if you think of the development of </v>
<v Speaker 1>rationality,</v>

950
00:56:59.321 --> 00:57:00.154
<v Speaker 1>Cuban rationality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the things that </v>

951
00:57:01.541 --> 00:57:05.470
<v Speaker 1>necessarily distinguishes us from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals in which western culture has put</v>

952
00:57:05.471 --> 00:57:10.210
<v Speaker 1>more stress on than any other culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that can be reasonably portrayed</v>

953
00:57:10.270 --> 00:57:13.960
<v Speaker 1>from the mythological perspective as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>highest angel in God's heavenly kingdom,</v>

954
00:57:13.961 --> 00:57:14.794
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about that as the description of </v>

955
00:57:16.181 --> 00:57:19.180
<v Speaker 1>an inter psychic hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What that says,</v>

956
00:57:19.181 --> 00:57:24.181
<v Speaker 1>that what that says is that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>rationality construct something and then</v>

957
00:57:25.691 --> 00:57:30.040
<v Speaker 1>attempts to make of it a god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instantly everything around it will turn</v>

958
00:57:30.041 --> 00:57:33.820
<v Speaker 1>into something that resembles hail 10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a story about.</v>

959
00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:38.110
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a story about the dangers </v>
<v Speaker 1>of authoritarian presumption,</v>

960
00:57:38.830 --> 00:57:39.663
<v Speaker 1>so I want you to read it in the context </v>
<v Speaker 1>of these other works and you can make </v>

961
00:57:43.241 --> 00:57:45.550
<v Speaker 1>your own judgment about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is to say,</v>

962
00:57:45.610 --> 00:57:47.440
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all it is is to say this.</v>

963
00:57:47.770 --> 00:57:48.603
<v Speaker 1>If you construct the system of belief</v>
<v Speaker 1>with your rational faculties and then </v>

964
00:57:54.341 --> 00:57:56.980
<v Speaker 1>make up that system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that has all the attributes of</v>

965
00:57:56.981 --> 00:57:57.814
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then what will necessarily happen </v>

966
00:58:00.641 --> 00:58:03.700
<v Speaker 1>because you're completely opaque to any </v>
<v Speaker 1>anomalous information,</v>

967
00:58:03.970 --> 00:58:04.803
<v Speaker 1>is that within a brief span of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything around you will turn into a </v>

968
00:58:08.021 --> 00:58:08.854
<v Speaker 1>wasteland and also that all you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do to get out of it is admitting that </v>

969
00:58:12.731 --> 00:58:13.564
<v Speaker 1>you're wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the things that happens </v>

970
00:58:15.031 --> 00:58:15.864
<v Speaker 1>to milk Satan by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all he has to do to get out of where he </v>

971
00:58:17.681 --> 00:58:19.030
<v Speaker 1>is is admit that he was wrong.</v>

972
00:58:19.390 --> 00:58:21.040
<v Speaker 1>That's it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he won't do that.</v>

973
00:58:21.140 --> 00:58:25.510
<v Speaker 1>So I would rather I'd rather rule </v>
<v Speaker 1>inhaled and serve in heaven and I,</v>

974
00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:28.060
<v Speaker 1>I think from my perspective as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>clinical psychologist,</v>

975
00:58:28.061 --> 00:58:28.894
<v Speaker 1>that that's the most accurate </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation of neurotic personality </v>

976
00:58:31.481 --> 00:58:34.480
<v Speaker 1>that I've ever encountered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's exactly the situation.</v>

977
00:58:34.481 --> 00:58:37.000
<v Speaker 1>Just like you're doing something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>follows up your life,</v>

978
00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:38.873
<v Speaker 1>you'd rather do that than change </v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically as you because you're the </v>

979
00:58:42.071 --> 00:58:43.570
<v Speaker 1>master of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

980
00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:45.520
<v Speaker 1>It's knowing what we know how that </v>
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>

981
00:58:45.670 --> 00:58:47.670
<v Speaker 1>It's unknown territory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

982
00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:48.953
<v Speaker 1>Because you don't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to go through this </v>

983
00:58:50.141 --> 00:58:51.340
<v Speaker 1>process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

984
00:58:51.460 --> 00:58:53.830
<v Speaker 1>to stay there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be miserable and it's gonna get</v>

985
00:58:53.831 --> 00:58:57.910
<v Speaker 1>worse all the time and it will get as </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad as it can possibly be.</v>

986
00:58:58.990 --> 00:58:59.850
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to do.</v>

987
00:59:00.010 --> 00:59:03.520
<v Speaker 1>To get rid of it is to pause that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you stepped outside of it's something</v>

988
00:59:03.521 --> 00:59:05.320
<v Speaker 1>good might happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you won't do that.</v>

989
00:59:06.070 --> 00:59:10.320
<v Speaker 1>So is that what you mean when you talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about Communist Roger?</v>

990
00:59:10.690 --> 00:59:12.100
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

991
00:59:12.101 --> 00:59:14.380
<v Speaker 1>That's an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly it.</v>

992
00:59:14.620 --> 00:59:15.453
<v Speaker 1>If you think of that though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's difficult within the domains of </v>

993
00:59:17.441 --> 00:59:19.240
<v Speaker 1>rationality during depression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ality.</v>

994
00:59:19.870 --> 00:59:21.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

995
00:59:21.740 --> 00:59:23.550
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not necessarily the case level.</v>

996
00:59:24.520 --> 00:59:25.353
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you right away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about the relative </v>

997
00:59:28.221 --> 00:59:31.700
<v Speaker 1>importance of phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's let's look at it this way.</v>

998
00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:33.133
<v Speaker 1>Say what your rationality does this help</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make sense of phenomena that you </v>

999
00:59:36.711 --> 00:59:40.520
<v Speaker 1>encountered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is not necessarily the thing that</v>

1000
00:59:40.550 --> 00:59:41.383
<v Speaker 1>propels you forward to the place where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll find something to make sense out </v>

1001
00:59:44.621 --> 00:59:45.454
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that so I would say that </v>

1002
00:59:47.151 --> 00:59:51.500
<v Speaker 1>your rationality is doing a proper job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means that it's in the right place</v>

1003
00:59:51.501 --> 00:59:52.334
<v Speaker 1>in the hierarchy values.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's always serving the tendency to </v>

1004
00:59:55.821 --> 00:59:59.660
<v Speaker 1>go out and make order out of chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now if you.</v>

1005
00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:02.120
<v Speaker 1>That's not rationality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's something else.</v>

1006
01:00:02.450 --> 01:00:04.520
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing that makes rationality </v>
<v Speaker 1>useful.</v>

1007
01:00:04.790 --> 01:00:07.670
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if your rationality and then it sort</v>

1008
01:00:07.671 --> 01:00:09.590
<v Speaker 1>of follows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you wouldn't understand this,</v>

1009
01:00:10.450 --> 01:00:12.170
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't necessarily like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

1010
01:00:12.171 --> 01:00:13.004
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't necessarily want the </v>

1011
01:00:13.551 --> 01:00:14.384
<v Speaker 1>subordinate position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something that's very relevant to </v>

1012
01:00:16.041 --> 01:00:18.350
<v Speaker 1>western culture because I believe this </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the case.</v>

1013
01:00:18.620 --> 01:00:19.453
<v Speaker 1>I hope this is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that after the French </v>

1014
01:00:22.130 --> 01:00:22.963
<v Speaker 1>revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the first things that happened </v>

1015
01:00:23.991 --> 01:00:24.824
<v Speaker 1>was the erection of a statue to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>goddess of reason in Notre Dame </v>

1016
01:00:27.381 --> 01:00:29.630
<v Speaker 1>cathedral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does anybody know if that's true?</v>

1017
01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:34.700
<v Speaker 1>I think that was one of the immediate </v>
<v Speaker 1>post revolutionary acts,</v>

1018
01:00:34.701 --> 01:00:36.500
<v Speaker 1>but it's very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very symbolic.</v>

1019
01:00:36.501 --> 01:00:37.334
<v Speaker 1>I think because the French Revolution </v>
<v Speaker 1>was one of the first extra religious </v>

1020
01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:43.333
<v Speaker 1>movements in western culture understands</v>
<v Speaker 1>the attempt to put reason up on the </v>

1021
01:00:46.011 --> 01:00:49.160
<v Speaker 1>highest pedestal and there's a problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>with that.</v>

1022
01:00:49.161 --> 01:00:51.590
<v Speaker 1>And that's the problem that Milton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think was wrestling with and said,</v>

1023
01:00:51.591 --> 01:00:52.041
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1024
01:00:52.041 --> 01:00:54.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rationalities a good master,</v>

1025
01:00:55.370 --> 01:00:57.530
<v Speaker 1>good servant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a terrible master.</v>

1026
01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:00.500
<v Speaker 1>So then the question is what's supposed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be the master?</v>

1027
01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:01.543
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that's interesting about this </v>

1028
01:01:02.331 --> 01:01:03.164
<v Speaker 1>is there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a line of mythology and </v>

1029
01:01:04.551 --> 01:01:05.384
<v Speaker 1>Christianity that sort of points out </v>
<v Speaker 1>that this is vague again and there's no </v>

1030
01:01:08.661 --> 01:01:11.390
<v Speaker 1>canonical basis board as far as I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

1031
01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:13.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the,</v>

1032
01:01:13.180 --> 01:01:14.013
<v Speaker 1>that Satan was the gods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oldest son who was passed over in favor </v>

1033
01:01:17.391 --> 01:01:18.980
<v Speaker 1>of the youngest son who was Christ.</v>

1034
01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.930
<v Speaker 1>And that's a common mythological theme </v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

1035
01:01:20.931 --> 01:01:21.764
<v Speaker 1>that the passing over of the older and </v>
<v Speaker 1>wiser son and in favor of the younger </v>

1036
01:01:25.641 --> 01:01:30.170
<v Speaker 1>and more questionable son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's part of the,</v>

1037
01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:31.910
<v Speaker 1>that's part of the mythology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the trickster.</v>

1038
01:01:31.911 --> 01:01:36.410
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the point is here is that rationality.</v>

1039
01:01:37.190 --> 01:01:38.023
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to serve the</v>
<v Speaker 1>as opposed to certainly hero and not to </v>

1040
01:01:44.931 --> 01:01:45.764
<v Speaker 1>constrain it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can say it's supposed to be </v>

1041
01:01:47.121 --> 01:01:50.990
<v Speaker 1>subordinate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be a subordinate process,</v>

1042
01:01:50.991 --> 01:01:52.790
<v Speaker 1>and as soon as it's known as supportive </v>
<v Speaker 1>process,</v>

1043
01:01:52.791 --> 01:01:57.050
<v Speaker 1>which means as soon as it says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I have created is everything that's</v>

1044
01:01:57.051 --> 01:01:59.130
<v Speaker 1>necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it then it.</v>

1045
01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:02.050
<v Speaker 1>While that's tantamount to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution in heaven,</v>

1046
01:02:02.270 --> 01:02:07.270
<v Speaker 1>this is my spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1047
01:02:08.930 --> 01:02:09.763
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1048
01:02:09.810 --> 01:02:10.870
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1049
01:02:11.210 --> 01:02:16.210
<v Speaker 1>that's a really good observation because</v>
<v Speaker 1>star trek is pure mythology to boldly go</v>

1050
01:02:16.671 --> 01:02:19.130
<v Speaker 1>where no man has ever gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one now,</v>

1051
01:02:20.380 --> 01:02:21.213
<v Speaker 5>but that's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's right,</v>

1052
01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:22.193
<v Speaker 5>because it's a well constructed and </v>
<v Speaker 5>spock is subordinate to the </v>

1053
01:02:25.261 --> 01:02:28.380
<v Speaker 5>irrationalities of the human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's right,</v>

1054
01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:31.460
<v Speaker 5>and the drive and the drive to explore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1055
01:02:31.650 --> 01:02:32.250
<v Speaker 5>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Great.</v>

1056
01:02:32.250 --> 01:02:36.340
<v Speaker 5>Very Fun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They also has pointed ears and have a</v>

1057
01:02:38.010 --> 01:02:43.010
<v Speaker 5>of</v>
<v Speaker 5>data,</v>

1058
01:02:44.810 --> 01:02:46.200
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1059
01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:50.540
<v Speaker 5>Rationale,</v>
<v Speaker 5>rationale,</v>

1060
01:02:56.950 --> 01:02:57.783
<v Speaker 5>all knowing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all knowing is the big thing as far as </v>

1061
01:02:59.971 --> 01:03:03.540
<v Speaker 5>I'm concerned with regards to radiology,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because that's what an ideology does,</v>

1062
01:03:03.541 --> 01:03:04.890
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're an authoritarian,</v>

1063
01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:06.270
<v Speaker 5>although you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sorry,</v>

1064
01:03:06.300 --> 01:03:10.390
<v Speaker 5>go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Talking about</v>

1065
01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:17.150
<v Speaker 5>religion might be trying to tell about </v>
<v Speaker 5>his or her place within a community.</v>

1066
01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:23.730
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to lead into that in today's </v>
<v Speaker 5>discussion,</v>

1067
01:03:24.390 --> 01:03:26.640
<v Speaker 5>and this is all sort of preliminary </v>
<v Speaker 5>material,</v>

1068
01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:30.640
<v Speaker 5>but most of the last half of the course </v>
<v Speaker 5>talks about this,</v>

1069
01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:32.810
<v Speaker 5>this relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is what you're trying.</v>

1070
01:03:32.850 --> 01:03:33.683
<v Speaker 5>What's the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's the proper balance between the </v>

1071
01:03:35.581 --> 01:03:36.610
<v Speaker 5>individual and that culture?</v>

1072
01:03:40.780 --> 01:03:44.880
<v Speaker 5>Is the idea that religion is supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 5>liberate the individual.</v>

1073
01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:49.110
<v Speaker 5>How.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1074
01:03:49.110 --> 01:03:51.210
<v Speaker 5>Given that line of reasoning,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>

1075
01:03:51.270 --> 01:03:54.240
<v Speaker 5>what would you use as the definition of </v>
<v Speaker 5>self?</v>

1076
01:03:56.020 --> 01:04:01.020
<v Speaker 5>The Ego in another words that that </v>
<v Speaker 5>everything is within my own self.</v>

1077
01:04:03.241 --> 01:04:08.241
<v Speaker 5>Everything I see and what's real,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what I see is real.</v>

1078
01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:10.353
<v Speaker 5>What you may see is not necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 5>right because I'm operating within </v>

1079
01:04:14.241 --> 01:04:17.400
<v Speaker 5>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The idea of liberation from the prisons.</v>

1080
01:04:17.430 --> 01:04:19.560
<v Speaker 5>I mean that would.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think in part</v>

1081
01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:23.273
<v Speaker 5>the problem is is that there's two </v>
<v Speaker 5>aspects to the systems as a general </v>

1082
01:04:26.131 --> 01:04:26.964
<v Speaker 5>rule,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's the aspect that socializes and </v>

1083
01:04:28.861 --> 01:04:29.694
<v Speaker 5>then there's the aspect that attempts to</v>
<v Speaker 5>transcend the consequences of </v>

1084
01:04:31.891 --> 01:04:34.560
<v Speaker 5>socialization and they tend to work at </v>
<v Speaker 5>cross purposes.</v>

1085
01:04:35.130 --> 01:04:38.930
<v Speaker 5>That's why one of the stories you'll </v>
<v Speaker 5>read later in the manuscript is</v>

1086
01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:43.590
<v Speaker 5>edited it down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dostoevsky story,</v>

1087
01:04:43.591 --> 01:04:46.410
<v Speaker 5>the grand inquisitor and then the grand </v>
<v Speaker 5>inquisitor.</v>

1088
01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:51.930
<v Speaker 5>Christ comes back to Earth and he runs </v>
<v Speaker 5>into the inquisitive who says,</v>

1089
01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:55.380
<v Speaker 5>who in prisons prison immediately we're </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to kill you.</v>

1090
01:04:56.550 --> 01:04:58.560
<v Speaker 5>You established this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but now that it's here,</v>

1091
01:04:58.561 --> 01:05:01.560
<v Speaker 5>you shouldn't come back to mess it up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fine.</v>

1092
01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:04.560
<v Speaker 5>The next day when he was supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 5>kill him,</v>

1093
01:05:04.740 --> 01:05:07.430
<v Speaker 5>he lets him go out the back door.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1094
01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:08.713
<v Speaker 5>that's regarded as sort of as the </v>
<v Speaker 5>pinnacle of Dostoyevsky's literary </v>

1095
01:05:11.101 --> 01:05:13.290
<v Speaker 5>achievement.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A particular story,</v>

1096
01:05:13.590 --> 01:05:16.260
<v Speaker 5>and it is a brilliant story because it </v>
<v Speaker 5>basically says that,</v>

1097
01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:18.040
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this is</v>

1098
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:19.870
<v Speaker 1>mostly with regards to the Catholic </v>
<v Speaker 1>church,</v>

1099
01:05:19.970 --> 01:05:23.980
<v Speaker 1>that religion necessarily has to impose </v>
<v Speaker 1>a structure.</v>

1100
01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:27.400
<v Speaker 1>It has to because if there's no </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>

1101
01:05:27.401 --> 01:05:31.270
<v Speaker 1>there's no protection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in order to maintain that structure,</v>

1102
01:05:31.870 --> 01:05:35.440
<v Speaker 1>it has to allow the process that creates</v>
<v Speaker 1>it in order to exist,</v>

1103
01:05:35.441 --> 01:05:36.274
<v Speaker 1>at least to the degree that it can </v>
<v Speaker 1>continue to update the structure and </v>

1104
01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:42.480
<v Speaker 1>that's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly dead on.</v>

1105
01:05:42.481 --> 01:05:46.300
<v Speaker 1>Relevant to your question with regards </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the proper role of the relationship,</v>

1106
01:05:46.820 --> 01:05:49.330
<v Speaker 1>proper role of the individual with </v>
<v Speaker 1>regards to culture.</v>

1107
01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:52.060
<v Speaker 1>It's the same relationship that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pharaoh,</v>

1108
01:05:52.061 --> 01:05:52.894
<v Speaker 1>how do you need you to society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to embody the culture </v>

1109
01:05:56.450 --> 01:05:57.283
<v Speaker 1>and I would think in part the notion of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the prison of the self is partly the </v>

1110
01:06:00.671 --> 01:06:01.504
<v Speaker 1>idea that you embodied the culture which</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you swallowed the particular </v>

1111
01:06:06.521 --> 01:06:09.850
<v Speaker 1>morality and the ways and the means that</v>
<v Speaker 1>your culture says to act,</v>

1112
01:06:10.150 --> 01:06:11.740
<v Speaker 1>but then there's this other part which </v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

1113
01:06:11.860 --> 01:06:14.170
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are that endure necessarily that,</v>

1114
01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:18.460
<v Speaker 1>but you're also the thing that created </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and the thing that can update it.</v>

1115
01:06:18.461 --> 01:06:19.720
<v Speaker 1>When when necessary,</v>

1116
01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:24.680
<v Speaker 5>you also swallowed religion,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which creates,</v>

1117
01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:27.790
<v Speaker 5>and I'm not necessarily sure that </v>
<v Speaker 5>religion was free.</v>

1118
01:06:28.210 --> 01:06:31.010
<v Speaker 5>No Man from the south because it creates</v>
<v Speaker 5>a suffolk.</v>

1119
01:06:31.980 --> 01:06:32.813
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends.</v>

1120
01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:35.080
<v Speaker 1>It depends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it because you have to send.</v>

1121
01:06:36.020 --> 01:06:36.853
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This leads in directly to what we were </v>

1122
01:06:38.191 --> 01:06:42.020
<v Speaker 1>going to decide what we were going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>discuss today because I,</v>

1123
01:06:42.060 --> 01:06:42.893
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I titled the Chapter That We're </v>

1124
01:06:44.491 --> 01:06:45.324
<v Speaker 1>discussing today apprenticeship that </v>
<v Speaker 1>inculturation and that has to do with </v>

1125
01:06:48.751 --> 01:06:49.584
<v Speaker 1>the adoption of a shared map and so the </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue is going to look at this </v>

1126
01:06:52.890 --> 01:06:56.370
<v Speaker 1>particular diagram.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to read you something again.</v>

1127
01:06:58.860 --> 01:06:59.693
<v Speaker 1>I'll get to this one sec.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to finish going through </v>

1128
01:07:01.201 --> 01:07:02.034
<v Speaker 1>these books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The last three books have to do with </v>

1129
01:07:05.130 --> 01:07:08.190
<v Speaker 1>alchemy and they ultimately is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion.</v>

1130
01:07:08.260 --> 01:07:09.093
<v Speaker 1>Humans writing something with me anyways</v>
<v Speaker 1>or discussion of a collection of 2000 </v>

1131
01:07:12.541 --> 01:07:13.374
<v Speaker 1>years of symbols.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The yellow thought illustrated that </v>

1132
01:07:15.721 --> 01:07:16.554
<v Speaker 1>process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the process of radical re </v>

1133
01:07:19.831 --> 01:07:21.150
<v Speaker 1>adaptation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1134
01:07:23.070 --> 01:07:26.700
<v Speaker 1>I want to read you something for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of long,</v>

1135
01:07:26.790 --> 01:07:28.350
<v Speaker 1>but I want you to listen to it </v>
<v Speaker 1>carefully.</v>

1136
01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:32.250
<v Speaker 1>This is from the navel and if you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you listened to this,</v>

1137
01:07:32.310 --> 01:07:33.143
<v Speaker 1>then you'll also know why I want you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>read beyond good and evil because the </v>

1138
01:07:35.221 --> 01:07:37.430
<v Speaker 1>whole book is like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just this particular.</v>

1139
01:07:40.380 --> 01:07:45.120
<v Speaker 1>Every morality is as opposed to letting </v>
<v Speaker 1>oneself go,</v>

1140
01:07:45.660 --> 01:07:50.660
<v Speaker 1>a bit of tyranny against nature also </v>
<v Speaker 1>against reason,</v>

1141
01:07:51.870 --> 01:07:52.703
<v Speaker 1>but this in itself is no objection as </v>
<v Speaker 1>long as we do have some other morality </v>

1142
01:07:56.910 --> 01:07:57.743
<v Speaker 1>which permits us to decree that every </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of tyranny and unreasonable is </v>

1143
01:08:00.110 --> 01:08:00.943
<v Speaker 1>impermissible</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is essential and didn't ask to </v>

1144
01:08:04.870 --> 01:08:07.160
<v Speaker 1>mobile in every morality because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've.</v>

1145
01:08:07.190 --> 01:08:12.190
<v Speaker 1>It constitutes a long compulsion</v>
<v Speaker 1>to understand stoicism or puritanism.</v>

1146
01:08:14.550 --> 01:08:15.383
<v Speaker 1>One should recall the compulsion or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whichever language so far has achieved </v>

1147
01:08:18.021 --> 01:08:18.854
<v Speaker 1>strength and freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The metrical compulsion of rhyme and </v>

1148
01:08:21.231 --> 01:08:22.710
<v Speaker 1>rhythm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1149
01:08:22.730 --> 01:08:24.500
<v Speaker 1>so what Nietzsche is trying to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's</v>

1150
01:08:29.140 --> 01:08:33.130
<v Speaker 1>that there's a necessary relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>between morality and slavery.</v>

1151
01:08:34.900 --> 01:08:39.100
<v Speaker 1>To adopt any particular viewpoint means </v>
<v Speaker 1>to exclude all other viewpoints,</v>

1152
01:08:40.150 --> 01:08:40.983
<v Speaker 1>but also that having done so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having adopted one limited viewpoint </v>

1153
01:08:45.490 --> 01:08:46.323
<v Speaker 1>means the possibility to develop all </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of skills that you might not </v>

1154
01:08:48.941 --> 01:08:51.290
<v Speaker 1>otherwise be able to develop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it uses the metaphor.</v>

1155
01:08:51.340 --> 01:08:52.173
<v Speaker 1>Poetry says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look what a poet does to produce poetry </v>

1156
01:08:56.770 --> 01:09:01.600
<v Speaker 1>and to develop the language is to put </v>
<v Speaker 1>way more constraint on his or her domain</v>

1157
01:09:01.601 --> 01:09:05.080
<v Speaker 1>of action than is normally the case and </v>
<v Speaker 1>paradoxically,</v>

1158
01:09:05.081 --> 01:09:07.360
<v Speaker 1>as a consequence of applying this </v>
<v Speaker 1>constraint,</v>

1159
01:09:07.970 --> 01:09:10.720
<v Speaker 1>something is created instead of just </v>
<v Speaker 1>being repressed.</v>

1160
01:09:11.170 --> 01:09:16.120
<v Speaker 1>So you say you don't have to only allow </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself to write in rhyme and rhythm.</v>

1161
01:09:17.230 --> 01:09:18.063
<v Speaker 1>It's much more difficult to do that </v>
<v Speaker 1>which you might say would constitute a </v>

1162
01:09:21.011 --> 01:09:24.430
<v Speaker 1>barrier to achievement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Nietzsche is pointing out that it is</v>

1163
01:09:24.431 --> 01:09:25.264
<v Speaker 1>in fact the position of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>constraints that constitutes the </v>

1164
01:09:27.551 --> 01:09:29.020
<v Speaker 1>precondition for freedom.</v>

1165
01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:30.273
<v Speaker 1>So he's making a strange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strange claim that under in some </v>

1166
01:09:33.821 --> 01:09:34.654
<v Speaker 1>contexts of interpretation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slavery as a necessary precondition for </v>

1167
01:09:37.631 --> 01:09:39.460
<v Speaker 1>freedom go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the question is,</v>

1168
01:09:39.970 --> 01:09:40.803
<v Speaker 1>you better understand the context in </v>
<v Speaker 1>which that's true and the context in </v>

1169
01:09:44.921 --> 01:09:47.800
<v Speaker 1>which that's not great and we'll but </v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll get to that later.</v>

1170
01:09:48.970 --> 01:09:52.000
<v Speaker 1>How much trouble the poets and orators </v>
<v Speaker 1>of all peoples have taken,</v>

1171
01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:53.433
<v Speaker 1>not accepting a few prose writers today </v>
<v Speaker 1>and who's he are there dwells in </v>

1172
01:09:55.881 --> 01:09:56.714
<v Speaker 1>exhaustible conscience for the sake of </v>
<v Speaker 1>some foolishness as utilitarian adults </v>

1173
01:10:01.601 --> 01:10:03.040
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling smart,</v>

1174
01:10:03.910 --> 01:10:06.910
<v Speaker 1>submitted abjectly to capricious laws as</v>
<v Speaker 1>anarchists,</v>

1175
01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:09.550
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling free or even free spirited,</v>

1176
01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:15.300
<v Speaker 1>but the curious fact is that all there </v>
<v Speaker 1>is or has it been on earth of freedom,</v>

1177
01:10:15.301 --> 01:10:16.650
<v Speaker 1>subtlety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boldness,</v>

1178
01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:17.513
<v Speaker 1>dance and masterly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sharing this weather in thought itself </v>

1179
01:10:19.981 --> 01:10:24.180
<v Speaker 1>or in government or in the rhetoric and </v>
<v Speaker 1>persuasion in the arts,</v>

1180
01:10:24.510 --> 01:10:25.343
<v Speaker 1>just as an ethics has developed only </v>
<v Speaker 1>owing to the tyranny of such capricious </v>

1181
01:10:29.551 --> 01:10:30.384
<v Speaker 1>laws.</v>

1182
01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:35.330
<v Speaker 1>Every artist knows how far from any </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling of letting himself go.</v>

1183
01:10:35.331 --> 01:10:38.570
<v Speaker 1>His most natural state is the free </v>
<v Speaker 1>ordering,</v>

1184
01:10:38.571 --> 01:10:39.700
<v Speaker 1>placing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disposing,</v>

1185
01:10:39.710 --> 01:10:40.543
<v Speaker 1>giving form in the moment of inspiration</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how strictly and suddenly he obeys </v>

1186
01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:45.353
<v Speaker 1>thousand fold laws precisely then laws </v>
<v Speaker 1>that precisely on account of their </v>

1187
01:10:49.611 --> 01:10:53.720
<v Speaker 1>hardness and determination defy all </v>
<v Speaker 1>formulation through concepts.</v>

1188
01:10:54.830 --> 01:10:58.280
<v Speaker 1>Even the firmest concept is compared </v>
<v Speaker 1>with them not free of fluctuation,</v>

1189
01:10:58.281 --> 01:10:59.510
<v Speaker 1>multiplicity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

1190
01:10:59.511 --> 01:11:02.030
<v Speaker 1>but the other thing that needs she's </v>
<v Speaker 1>pointing out there,</v>

1191
01:11:02.031 --> 01:11:07.031
<v Speaker 1>and this is an example of how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how decades of thought that are still to</v>

1192
01:11:08.481 --> 01:11:11.880
<v Speaker 1>come are embedded in his sentences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Law,</v>

1193
01:11:12.070 --> 01:11:14.850
<v Speaker 1>is that precisely on account of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>hardness and determination,</v>

1194
01:11:14.851 --> 01:11:17.760
<v Speaker 1>defy all formulation through concepts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's saying,</v>

1195
01:11:17.761 --> 01:11:21.420
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you were free as an artist,</v>

1196
01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:24.780
<v Speaker 1>your acting according to precepts that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are inviolable,</v>

1197
01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:29.010
<v Speaker 1>that are so archaic that you can't even </v>
<v Speaker 1>say what they are.</v>

1198
01:11:29.350 --> 01:11:31.260
<v Speaker 1>They're still implicit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>still implicit,</v>

1199
01:11:31.340 --> 01:11:32.730
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're still procedural.</v>

1200
01:11:34.650 --> 01:11:39.650
<v Speaker 1>What is essential in heaven and earth </v>
<v Speaker 1>seems to be to say once again that there</v>

1201
01:11:39.781 --> 01:11:40.614
<v Speaker 1>should be obedience over a long period </v>
<v Speaker 1>of time and in a single direction given </v>

1202
01:11:44.521 --> 01:11:45.354
<v Speaker 1>that something worthwhile always </v>
<v Speaker 1>develops and has developed for whose </v>

1203
01:11:47.431 --> 01:11:49.290
<v Speaker 1>sake it is worthwhile to live on earth.</v>

1204
01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:52.850
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>virtue art,</v>

1205
01:11:52.910 --> 01:11:54.320
<v Speaker 1>music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dance reason,</v>

1206
01:11:54.350 --> 01:11:56.900
<v Speaker 1>spirituality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something transfiguring,</v>

1207
01:11:56.901 --> 01:12:01.610
<v Speaker 1>subtle Nad and divine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The long unfreedom of the spirit.</v>

1208
01:12:02.060 --> 01:12:05.090
<v Speaker 1>The mistrustful constraint in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicability of thoughts.</v>

1209
01:12:05.650 --> 01:12:06.483
<v Speaker 1>The disciplined thinkers imposed on </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves to think within the </v>

1210
01:12:08.961 --> 01:12:09.794
<v Speaker 1>directions laid down by a church or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>court or under era's Tutelian </v>

1211
01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:17.330
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the long spiritual will to interpret all</v>

1212
01:12:17.331 --> 01:12:22.220
<v Speaker 1>events under a Christian Schema and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>rediscover and justify the Christian God</v>

1213
01:12:22.221 --> 01:12:25.070
<v Speaker 1>and every accident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of this,</v>

1214
01:12:25.370 --> 01:12:27.770
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forced capricious hard,</v>

1215
01:12:27.950 --> 01:12:28.783
<v Speaker 1>gruesome and anti rash has shown itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be the means through which the </v>

1216
01:12:32.691 --> 01:12:34.850
<v Speaker 1>European spirit has been trained to </v>
<v Speaker 1>strength,</v>

1217
01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:35.953
<v Speaker 1>ruthless curiosity and subtle mobility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although admittedly in the process and </v>

1218
01:12:40.820 --> 01:12:44.270
<v Speaker 1>irreplaceable amount of strength and </v>
<v Speaker 1>spirit had to be crushed,</v>

1219
01:12:44.540 --> 01:12:45.373
<v Speaker 1>stifled in the room</v>
<v Speaker 1>that for thousands of years of European </v>

1220
01:12:49.371 --> 01:12:51.470
<v Speaker 1>thinkers thought merely in order to </v>
<v Speaker 1>prove something</v>

1221
01:12:53.050 --> 01:12:53.883
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conversely,</v>

1222
01:12:53.970 --> 01:12:56.260
<v Speaker 1>we suspect everything or who wants to </v>
<v Speaker 1>prove something,</v>

1223
01:12:57.520 --> 01:12:58.353
<v Speaker 1>that the conclusions that aren't to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>the result of the most rigorous </v>

1224
01:13:00.401 --> 01:13:02.680
<v Speaker 1>reflections were always settled from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>start,</v>

1225
01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:03.873
<v Speaker 1>just as it use to be with Asiatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>astrology and still is today with the </v>

1226
01:13:07.181 --> 01:13:08.014
<v Speaker 1>innocuous Christian moral interpretation</v>
<v Speaker 1>of our most intimate personal </v>

1227
01:13:10.721 --> 01:13:13.470
<v Speaker 1>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This tyranny,</v>

1228
01:13:13.471 --> 01:13:14.304
<v Speaker 1>this Capris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this rigorous and grandiose stupidity </v>

1229
01:13:16.850 --> 01:13:20.710
<v Speaker 1>because educated the spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slavery is as it seems,</v>

1230
01:13:20.711 --> 01:13:22.870
<v Speaker 1>both in the cruder and in the more </v>
<v Speaker 1>subtle sense,</v>

1231
01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:23.793
<v Speaker 1>the indispensable means of spiritual </v>
<v Speaker 1>discipline and cultivation to consider </v>

1232
01:13:27.731 --> 01:13:29.230
<v Speaker 1>any more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot with this in mind,</v>

1233
01:13:29.740 --> 01:13:34.660
<v Speaker 1>what there is in it of nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>teaches hatred of just letting go of any</v>

1234
01:13:34.661 --> 01:13:35.494
<v Speaker 1>all to great freedom and implants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the need for limited horizons and the </v>

1235
01:13:38.741 --> 01:13:42.190
<v Speaker 1>nearest tasks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>teaching the narrowing of perspective,</v>

1236
01:13:42.670 --> 01:13:44.830
<v Speaker 1>and that's in a certain sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stupidity.</v>

1237
01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:45.953
<v Speaker 1>As a condition of life and growth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shall obey someone in for a long </v>

1238
01:13:50.831 --> 01:13:54.670
<v Speaker 1>time or else you will perish and lose </v>
<v Speaker 1>the last respect for yourself.</v>

1239
01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:58.420
<v Speaker 1>This appears to me to be the categorical</v>
<v Speaker 1>imperative of nature,</v>

1240
01:14:01.170 --> 01:14:03.210
<v Speaker 1>which is not addressed to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual,</v>

1241
01:14:03.430 --> 01:14:06.930
<v Speaker 1>but to people's races,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ages and classes above all,</v>

1242
01:14:06.931 --> 01:14:11.931
<v Speaker 1>to the whole human animal to ma'am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brilliant.</v>

1243
01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:15.130
<v Speaker 1>That's a brilliant page as far as I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned.</v>

1244
01:14:15.730 --> 01:14:16.563
<v Speaker 1>What's he saying in your question?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the proper relationship with </v>

1245
01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:23.700
<v Speaker 1>individual in culture with regards to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

1246
01:14:23.710 --> 01:14:24.630
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's what?</v>

1247
01:14:24.631 --> 01:14:27.790
<v Speaker 1>I wrote this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this diagram on the board here.</v>

1248
01:14:34.940 --> 01:14:37.130
<v Speaker 1>The unknown is both negative and </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive</v>

1249
01:14:40.450 --> 01:14:42.430
<v Speaker 1>and the culture is both negative and </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive.</v>

1250
01:14:42.460 --> 01:14:43.293
<v Speaker 1>Say you have to have a culture</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the culture brings </v>

1251
01:14:49.930 --> 01:14:50.763
<v Speaker 1>predictability to the objects that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>encounter and to all of your </v>

1252
01:14:54.431 --> 01:14:55.264
<v Speaker 1>interpersonal interactions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to have that because that in </v>

1253
01:14:59.801 --> 01:15:03.460
<v Speaker 1>its absence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything is so chaotic that you cannot</v>

1254
01:15:03.461 --> 01:15:06.460
<v Speaker 1>actually exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the literal,</v>

1255
01:15:06.790 --> 01:15:10.240
<v Speaker 1>the literal truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your culture regulates your emotions.</v>

1256
01:15:10.690 --> 01:15:11.523
<v Speaker 1>You can't just give it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if someone comes along with a </v>

1257
01:15:14.471 --> 01:15:15.304
<v Speaker 1>different idea and that different idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you accepted it would upset your </v>

1258
01:15:18.641 --> 01:15:20.020
<v Speaker 1>whole culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1259
01:15:20.021 --> 01:15:20.854
<v Speaker 1>you can't just accept that idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the alternative to accepting it </v>

1260
01:15:24.491 --> 01:15:25.324
<v Speaker 1>often seems to be to attempt to destroy </v>
<v Speaker 1>the person who brings the new </v>

1261
01:15:28.241 --> 01:15:29.074
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the problem with that is that now </v>

1262
01:15:31.571 --> 01:15:35.530
<v Speaker 1>we're so heavily armed that if one camp </v>
<v Speaker 1>attempts to destroy the other camp,</v>

1263
01:15:35.830 --> 01:15:38.110
<v Speaker 1>the overwhelming likelihood is the both </v>
<v Speaker 1>will disappear.</v>

1264
01:15:38.830 --> 01:15:42.700
<v Speaker 1>So on the one hand you can't just get </v>
<v Speaker 1>rid of your culture because someone else</v>

1265
01:15:42.701 --> 01:15:44.590
<v Speaker 1>comes along and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not the way to do things,</v>

1266
01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:47.313
<v Speaker 1>but you can't do what we've always done </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the past either which has have a war </v>

1267
01:15:49.601 --> 01:15:50.380
<v Speaker 1>about it and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1268
01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:52.120
<v Speaker 1>who's going to rule what territory?</v>

1269
01:15:52.930 --> 01:15:54.190
<v Speaker 1>So then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1270
01:15:54.820 --> 01:15:58.960
<v Speaker 1>given those two options,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as theoretically the only two options,</v>

1271
01:15:58.961 --> 01:16:03.160
<v Speaker 1>and then both the both the outcomes of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those two options or negative well,</v>

1272
01:16:03.161 --> 01:16:06.300
<v Speaker 1>what's left to do well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a real difficult question.</v>

1273
01:16:06.310 --> 01:16:08.050
<v Speaker 1>That's a paradox as far as I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned.</v>

1274
01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:09.393
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this diagram has speaks to that to some </v>

1275
01:16:12.581 --> 01:16:13.780
<v Speaker 1>degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say</v>

1276
01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:18.670
<v Speaker 1>nature is pointing out that in order to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to do anything,</v>

1277
01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:22.030
<v Speaker 1>you have to restrict what it is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to do to a narrow domain.</v>

1278
01:16:22.780 --> 01:16:26.280
<v Speaker 1>This is the notion of an apprenticeship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you want to become,</v>

1279
01:16:26.290 --> 01:16:27.123
<v Speaker 1>let's say a classical pianists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would they say to become a classical </v>

1280
01:16:29.831 --> 01:16:32.860
<v Speaker 1>pianist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need 20,000 hours of practice before</v>

1281
01:16:32.861 --> 01:16:36.490
<v Speaker 1>the age of 18 to become a concert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's assuming you have the,</v>

1282
01:16:36.730 --> 01:16:38.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the innate ability,</v>

1283
01:16:39.310 --> 01:16:40.143
<v Speaker 1>which basically means if you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>exclude from your life any number of </v>

1284
01:16:43.691 --> 01:16:47.560
<v Speaker 1>things that would have occupied those </v>
<v Speaker 1>$20,000 alternatively,</v>

1285
01:16:47.980 --> 01:16:48.813
<v Speaker 1>and that you have to subjugate all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your diverse individuality to this </v>

1286
01:16:53.591 --> 01:16:57.430
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily narrow range of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of action.</v>

1287
01:16:58.660 --> 01:16:59.493
<v Speaker 1>But the theory is that having </v>
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily subjugating yourself to a </v>

1288
01:17:05.621 --> 01:17:09.470
<v Speaker 1>set of arbitrary and fixed rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the rules that make up music are</v>

1289
01:17:09.471 --> 01:17:14.471
<v Speaker 1>in many ways arbitrary and fixed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you master that territory,</v>

1290
01:17:15.020 --> 01:17:20.020
<v Speaker 1>then you'll come out the other side with</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of those skills at your disposal and</v>

1291
01:17:20.511 --> 01:17:21.344
<v Speaker 1>then with the capacity to do something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that actually constitutes free to have </v>

1292
01:17:23.730 --> 01:17:24.563
<v Speaker 1>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the notion of the apprenticeship is </v>

1293
01:17:28.210 --> 01:17:29.043
<v Speaker 1>the long sub voluntary subjugation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the spirit followed by the capacity to </v>

1294
01:17:33.351 --> 01:17:36.410
<v Speaker 1>create a masterpiece.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know the word masterpiece</v>

1295
01:17:37.970 --> 01:17:40.960
<v Speaker 1>that signifies the end of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>apprenticeship right now.</v>

1296
01:17:41.020 --> 01:17:43.280
<v Speaker 1>It's even though I suppose where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>master's degree came from,</v>

1297
01:17:44.030 --> 01:17:44.863
<v Speaker 1>is that a masterpiece indicates that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>are now free from the tyranny of the </v>

1298
01:17:48.051 --> 01:17:51.500
<v Speaker 1>person to whom you were bound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means that you've absorbed everything</v>

1299
01:17:51.501 --> 01:17:52.334
<v Speaker 1>they know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plus you've added to what they knew and </v>

1300
01:17:54.801 --> 01:17:55.634
<v Speaker 1>transmitted to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something that's uniquely yours that </v>

1301
01:17:58.731 --> 01:18:00.980
<v Speaker 1>justifies the entire subjugation.</v>

1302
01:18:03.070 --> 01:18:05.570
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's that for me,</v>

1303
01:18:05.571 --> 01:18:10.190
<v Speaker 1>that seems to be the way out the of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural paradox because</v>

1304
01:18:11.700 --> 01:18:14.180
<v Speaker 1>that's an apprenticeship model of </v>
<v Speaker 1>adolescence.</v>

1305
01:18:14.300 --> 01:18:15.133
<v Speaker 1>I think that group identity is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the construction and strengthening of </v>

1306
01:18:21.711 --> 01:18:26.711
<v Speaker 1>group identity is the appropriate </v>
<v Speaker 1>developmental stage for adolescents that</v>

1307
01:18:28.401 --> 01:18:31.330
<v Speaker 1>it has to be gone through and this gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>rid of some of.</v>

1308
01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:32.413
<v Speaker 1>I think some of the more annoying </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspects of standard humanistic </v>

1309
01:18:34.911 --> 01:18:35.744
<v Speaker 1>psychology says you have to accept as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>precondition that subjugate yourself to </v>

1310
01:18:40.221 --> 01:18:41.054
<v Speaker 1>a set of rules that a lot of what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>are is going to not be developed in the </v>

1311
01:18:45.381 --> 01:18:46.214
<v Speaker 1>process because you always sacrifice </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility for actuality if you pursue </v>

1312
01:18:50.061 --> 01:18:52.940
<v Speaker 1>any actuality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the hope is that you'll come out the</v>

1313
01:18:52.941 --> 01:18:57.680
<v Speaker 1>other side with whatever is used still </v>
<v Speaker 1>in tact and it seems to me that.</v>

1314
01:19:01.350 --> 01:19:04.250
<v Speaker 1>Well that gives you the benefits of both</v>
<v Speaker 1>situations.</v>

1315
01:19:05.180 --> 01:19:10.180
<v Speaker 1>If you say the purpose of culture is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>predict,</v>

1316
01:19:13.100 --> 01:19:13.933
<v Speaker 1>protect the individual who's no longer a</v>
<v Speaker 1>child from the negative aspect of the </v>

1317
01:19:18.561 --> 01:19:21.380
<v Speaker 1>unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say children are dependent on their,</v>

1318
01:19:21.610 --> 01:19:23.300
<v Speaker 1>on their mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

1319
01:19:24.020 --> 01:19:26.990
<v Speaker 1>Initially</v>
<v Speaker 1>as they grow,</v>

1320
01:19:26.991 --> 01:19:27.824
<v Speaker 1>they start to</v>
<v Speaker 1>encounter problems in living that their </v>

1321
01:19:31.491 --> 01:19:35.390
<v Speaker 1>mother can no longer solve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Example hundred.</v>

1322
01:19:35.410 --> 01:19:36.243
<v Speaker 1>Both conditions like in our culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a male and you're 14 and your </v>

1323
01:19:39.561 --> 01:19:40.394
<v Speaker 1>brother is still trying to solve the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem of finding someone to date for </v>

1324
01:19:44.391 --> 01:19:45.224
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something seriously has gone wrong </v>

1325
01:19:47.300 --> 01:19:48.133
<v Speaker 1>because she's attempting to extend her </v>
<v Speaker 1>domain of protection past it's logical </v>

1326
01:19:52.431 --> 01:19:53.264
<v Speaker 1>bounce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to say the psychoanalysts used </v>

1327
01:19:54.801 --> 01:19:57.200
<v Speaker 1>to refer to that as the necessary </v>
<v Speaker 1>failure of the mother.</v>

1328
01:19:57.201 --> 01:19:59.660
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The point is is that as you grow up,</v>

1329
01:19:59.930 --> 01:20:03.890
<v Speaker 1>life starts to present to you problems </v>
<v Speaker 1>that weren't there to begin with,</v>

1330
01:20:04.010 --> 01:20:04.843
<v Speaker 1>that your other campaign and what moves </v>
<v Speaker 1>in fill the gap before you're fully </v>

1331
01:20:09.451 --> 01:20:14.190
<v Speaker 1>mature is is the processes associated </v>
<v Speaker 1>with group identification.</v>

1332
01:20:14.670 --> 01:20:15.503
<v Speaker 1>So it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a bridging bridging </v>

1333
01:20:18.490 --> 01:20:19.323
<v Speaker 1>mechanism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the problem that we face as a </v>

1334
01:20:22.111 --> 01:20:22.944
<v Speaker 1>race in a sense is that we're stuck at </v>
<v Speaker 1>an adolescent level of of adaptation is </v>

1335
01:20:29.371 --> 01:20:34.371
<v Speaker 1>that people even still view the </v>
<v Speaker 1>identification with the culture,</v>

1336
01:20:34.471 --> 01:20:37.020
<v Speaker 1>which is essentially the adoption of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>patriotic stance.</v>

1337
01:20:37.021 --> 01:20:37.854
<v Speaker 1>That's when we're looking at it as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>highest level of possible obtained </v>

1338
01:20:41.270 --> 01:20:43.290
<v Speaker 1>insurance people never individually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1339
01:20:43.300 --> 01:20:47.310
<v Speaker 1>that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>rarely enough.</v>

1340
01:20:47.311 --> 01:20:48.144
<v Speaker 1>So that being stuck at the level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural identification still poses a </v>

1341
01:20:51.301 --> 01:20:56.301
<v Speaker 1>major constant threat to her poses a </v>
<v Speaker 1>constant threat.</v>

1342
01:20:57.420 --> 01:20:59.160
<v Speaker 1>So not a blanket statement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>

1343
01:20:59.580 --> 01:21:01.380
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not a blanket statement because.</v>

1344
01:21:01.740 --> 01:21:05.880
<v Speaker 1>But I guess the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess the idea of perhaps is that well</v>

1345
01:21:05.881 --> 01:21:06.714
<v Speaker 1>at least that something beyond mere </v>
<v Speaker 1>adequate group identification might </v>

1346
01:21:10.741 --> 01:21:14.430
<v Speaker 1>realistically be posited as an ideal </v>
<v Speaker 1>without,</v>

1347
01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:15.473
<v Speaker 1>without necessarily undermining the idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>that group identification as a </v>

1348
01:21:21.150 --> 01:21:21.983
<v Speaker 1>developmental stage is absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary and that it has to be gone </v>

1349
01:21:25.681 --> 01:21:26.220
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>

1350
01:21:26.220 --> 01:21:27.053
<v Speaker 1>Like I mean you see people who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who never made the transition to group </v>

1351
01:21:30.811 --> 01:21:31.644
<v Speaker 1>identity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means that they remain dependent </v>

1352
01:21:33.091 --> 01:21:34.830
<v Speaker 1>on their mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's A.</v>

1353
01:21:34.830 --> 01:21:37.110
<v Speaker 1>There's a whole category of personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>disorder for that.</v>

1354
01:21:37.111 --> 01:21:37.944
<v Speaker 1>That's dependent personality disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't even make the first </v>

1355
01:21:40.111 --> 01:21:40.944
<v Speaker 1>transition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People who get through the group </v>

1356
01:21:43.771 --> 01:21:44.604
<v Speaker 1>identification process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think very often are those who </v>

1357
01:21:46.531 --> 01:21:47.364
<v Speaker 1>actually mastered it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they have gone through an </v>

1358
01:21:48.811 --> 01:21:49.644
<v Speaker 1>apprenticeship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means they've allowed themselves </v>

1359
01:21:50.971 --> 01:21:55.380
<v Speaker 1>to be subjugated to the group identity </v>
<v Speaker 1>and have absorbed all the discipline and</v>

1360
01:21:55.381 --> 01:22:00.381
<v Speaker 1>possibility that that subjugation</v>
<v Speaker 1>subjugation allows me to send you.</v>

1361
01:22:02.070 --> 01:22:02.903
<v Speaker 1>Some people do</v>
<v Speaker 1>manage to reach to go beyond that stage </v>

1362
01:22:08.251 --> 01:22:11.070
<v Speaker 1>without having very much group </v>
<v Speaker 1>identification</v>

1363
01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:14.033
<v Speaker 1>managed to reach the estate reach </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuation without going through a </v>

1364
01:22:18.361 --> 01:22:19.194
<v Speaker 1>great deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1365
01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:21.810
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you think of an example of that?</v>

1366
01:22:23.010 --> 01:22:25.380
<v Speaker 1>Because I'm not convinced that that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the case.</v>

1367
01:22:25.410 --> 01:22:26.340
<v Speaker 1>I think that these.</v>

1368
01:22:26.340 --> 01:22:27.173
<v Speaker 1>I think that this is an invariant </v>
<v Speaker 1>developmental stage that you can make </v>

1369
01:22:30.451 --> 01:22:31.284
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you can make the lead on </v>

1370
01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:33.433
<v Speaker 1>and I shouldn't say never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think that under most </v>

1371
01:22:36.091 --> 01:22:36.924
<v Speaker 1>circumstances you can make the leap from</v>
<v Speaker 1>childhood to adulthood without this </v>

1372
01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:41.633
<v Speaker 1>intervening inculturation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is mostly group foster because </v>

1373
01:22:45.361 --> 01:22:47.160
<v Speaker 1>it's then that you learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1374
01:22:47.460 --> 01:22:48.293
<v Speaker 1>as an adolescent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when you learn how to cope with </v>

1375
01:22:49.951 --> 01:22:50.784
<v Speaker 1>people in groups and how to and how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>to act as the responsible member of the </v>

1376
01:22:54.571 --> 01:22:56.790
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say once you've got that skill,</v>

1377
01:22:56.791 --> 01:22:58.980
<v Speaker 1>then you can go beyond it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you don't have it,</v>

1378
01:22:59.340 --> 01:23:00.173
<v Speaker 1>well it seems to me that that provides a</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty vicious impediment to your </v>

1379
01:23:02.851 --> 01:23:05.890
<v Speaker 1>continued progress or do you think think</v>
<v Speaker 1>could you get them at</v>

1380
01:23:06.490 --> 01:23:07.930
<v Speaker 4>more or less at the same time?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1381
01:23:07.931 --> 01:23:12.931
<v Speaker 4>I'm someone who is not particularly </v>
<v Speaker 4>socially capable until they,</v>

1382
01:23:14.830 --> 01:23:17.180
<v Speaker 4>until they become self capable and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think,</v>

1383
01:23:17.181 --> 01:23:18.014
<v Speaker 4>I mean I think most,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most kids go from there go from being </v>

1384
01:23:20.561 --> 01:23:21.394
<v Speaker 4>children to being members of a group and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then if they're lucky they move beyond </v>

1385
01:23:24.731 --> 01:23:26.300
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

1386
01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:29.860
<v Speaker 4>what about people who go from go from </v>
<v Speaker 4>children to being,</v>

1387
01:23:30.850 --> 01:23:34.450
<v Speaker 4>to being essentially sort of doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing and then building,</v>

1388
01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:37.210
<v Speaker 4>doing both at the same time?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean because sometimes if you have,</v>

1389
01:23:37.420 --> 01:23:40.630
<v Speaker 4>if you have a little enough social </v>
<v Speaker 4>ability you can,</v>

1390
01:23:41.140 --> 01:23:46.140
<v Speaker 4>you can be very</v>
<v Speaker 4>vulnerable or are outcast from the,</v>

1391
01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.280
<v Speaker 4>from the sort of group situation but at </v>
<v Speaker 4>the end.</v>

1392
01:23:50.410 --> 01:23:53.290
<v Speaker 4>But at the same time there are people </v>
<v Speaker 4>who are in that situation and we'll also</v>

1393
01:23:53.540 --> 01:23:58.540
<v Speaker 4>who have a fair amount of self </v>
<v Speaker 4>competence but,</v>

1394
01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:00.830
<v Speaker 4>but no social competence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you see what I.</v>

1395
01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:01.833
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about about possible </v>

1396
01:24:03.281 --> 01:24:04.114
<v Speaker 1>exceptions to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I would say perhaps that if </v>

1397
01:24:06.851 --> 01:24:07.684
<v Speaker 1>someone is popped out of the group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I identification game because they're </v>

1398
01:24:12.911 --> 01:24:14.800
<v Speaker 1>pursuing an interest that's unique to </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1399
01:24:15.340 --> 01:24:16.173
<v Speaker 1>That it's possible that the continued </v>
<v Speaker 1>development of the interest might lead </v>

1400
01:24:20.321 --> 01:24:25.321
<v Speaker 1>to to to a proper establishment of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>adult as an adult,</v>

1401
01:24:26.230 --> 01:24:27.063
<v Speaker 1>but I would also say that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>inappropriate to presume that group </v>

1402
01:24:30.371 --> 01:24:31.204
<v Speaker 1>identification necessarily mean </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that happens at the normal </v>

1403
01:24:34.571 --> 01:24:36.490
<v Speaker 1>level of adolescent behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is.</v>

1404
01:24:36.491 --> 01:24:38.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying necessarily that to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>the gap,</v>

1405
01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:41.080
<v Speaker 1>to make the jump from childhood to </v>
<v Speaker 1>adulthood,</v>

1406
01:24:41.230 --> 01:24:42.063
<v Speaker 1>it's necessarily to associate with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>gang of peers like in this a sort of </v>

1407
01:24:46.601 --> 01:24:49.720
<v Speaker 1>classic adolescent mode.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would also say for example,</v>

1408
01:24:49.721 --> 01:24:50.554
<v Speaker 1>that if you're interested in something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like say you're really good at the </v>

1409
01:24:52.091 --> 01:24:54.040
<v Speaker 1>violin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that might be an example.</v>

1410
01:24:54.041 --> 01:24:54.874
<v Speaker 1>If you have a particular talent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your peer group then becomes all those </v>

1411
01:24:58.451 --> 01:24:59.284
<v Speaker 1>people who've had that talent in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>past who's process of adaptation you're </v>

1412
01:25:03.491 --> 01:25:04.324
<v Speaker 1>imitating and mimicking to develop your </v>
<v Speaker 1>skills to move towards the point where </v>

1413
01:25:08.021 --> 01:25:09.730
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be an individual in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>old.</v>

1414
01:25:09.730 --> 01:25:11.410
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for us,</v>

1415
01:25:12.310 --> 01:25:14.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is especially true for </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are,</v>

1416
01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:15.273
<v Speaker 1>who are abstractly capable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your peer reference group might be the </v>

1417
01:25:18.851 --> 01:25:23.050
<v Speaker 1>group that you find in books because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where the group identity has been</v>

1418
01:25:23.051 --> 01:25:25.870
<v Speaker 1>abstracted into ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't necessarily like,</v>

1419
01:25:25.970 --> 01:25:28.240
<v Speaker 1>especially in a culture as complex as </v>
<v Speaker 1>ours,</v>

1420
01:25:28.420 --> 01:25:29.253
<v Speaker 1>there are peer groups who you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>identify with at every level of </v>

1421
01:25:33.341 --> 01:25:34.174
<v Speaker 1>functional analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are groups that are based purely </v>

1422
01:25:36.641 --> 01:25:37.474
<v Speaker 1>on a purely on ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are groups that are based more </v>

1423
01:25:41.470 --> 01:25:44.080
<v Speaker 1>explicitly on shared patterns of </v>
<v Speaker 1>activity,</v>

1424
01:25:44.470 --> 01:25:45.303
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I would still say that to get from </v>

1425
01:25:46.841 --> 01:25:49.330
<v Speaker 1>the point of being a child to the point </v>
<v Speaker 1>of being an adult,</v>

1426
01:25:49.510 --> 01:25:52.480
<v Speaker 1>there has to be this intermediate </v>
<v Speaker 1>intermediary process.</v>

1427
01:25:52.481 --> 01:25:53.314
<v Speaker 1>I think culturation you can choose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can pick and choose what that's </v>

1428
01:25:56.591 --> 01:25:59.340
<v Speaker 1>going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you need a framework like say,</v>

1429
01:25:59.410 --> 01:25:59.650
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

1430
01:25:59.650 --> 01:26:01.060
<v Speaker 4>if you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you were operating,</v>

1431
01:26:01.640 --> 01:26:03.770
<v Speaker 4>if you're someone who is capable enough </v>
<v Speaker 4>in something,</v>

1432
01:26:03.830 --> 01:26:04.663
<v Speaker 4>the semantic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the main may never make it back to </v>

1433
01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:08.410
<v Speaker 4>procedures essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is.</v>

1434
01:26:08.990 --> 01:26:09.823
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that would also be a mistake as </v>

1435
01:26:11.411 --> 01:26:12.250
<v Speaker 1>a general rule,</v>

1436
01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:14.280
<v Speaker 4>but.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

1437
01:26:14.510 --> 01:26:15.870
<v Speaker 4>but it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it can happen.</v>

1438
01:26:16.890 --> 01:26:17.820
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it does.</v>

1439
01:26:19.220 --> 01:26:20.840
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you said about books,</v>

1440
01:26:20.841 --> 01:26:21.674
<v Speaker 4>you have to be a representation of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that some mean someone who's maybe </v>

1441
01:26:25.740 --> 01:26:26.573
<v Speaker 4>maybe socially uncomfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't really use it reads a great </v>

1442
01:26:29.521 --> 01:26:32.280
<v Speaker 4>deal when you were saying that they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>essentially getting</v>

1443
01:26:32.780 --> 01:26:33.760
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure,</v>

1444
01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:35.310
<v Speaker 1>of course they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just the thing.</v>

1445
01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:36.153
<v Speaker 1>The group they're identifying with his </v>
<v Speaker 1>speed abstracted into into some maybe </v>

1446
01:26:39.500 --> 01:26:44.390
<v Speaker 1>their peer group may be people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly dead who live only in books,</v>

1447
01:26:44.450 --> 01:26:46.910
<v Speaker 1>which is not necessarily such a bad peer</v>
<v Speaker 1>reference group.</v>

1448
01:26:47.150 --> 01:26:47.983
<v Speaker 1>Depends on your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although I would also say that the </v>

1449
01:26:50.181 --> 01:26:51.014
<v Speaker 1>inability to deal with the living so to </v>
<v Speaker 1>speak sooner or later is going to </v>

1450
01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:57.380
<v Speaker 1>constitute it is likely going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>constitute a problem.</v>

1451
01:26:57.460 --> 01:27:01.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean it might not be a fatal error,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's still going to be a problem and</v>

1452
01:27:02.010 --> 01:27:04.850
<v Speaker 1>even somebody who was as a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would you say,</v>

1453
01:27:04.910 --> 01:27:05.743
<v Speaker 1>socially isolated as Nietzsche,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the latest part of his </v>

1454
01:27:07.671 --> 01:27:09.740
<v Speaker 1>life later part of his life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He still wrote,</v>

1455
01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:13.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean the desire to be part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>

1456
01:27:13.221 --> 01:27:14.054
<v Speaker 1>It's very paramount even among people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who are very individualistic and it's </v>

1457
01:27:16.851 --> 01:27:21.260
<v Speaker 1>also the case that the hero is not the </v>
<v Speaker 1>person who discovers the goal,</v>

1458
01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:24.520
<v Speaker 1>gets the gold from the dragon and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanders off up into the hill.</v>

1459
01:27:25.410 --> 01:27:26.243
<v Speaker 1>The hero is the person who gets the gold</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it goes back to the community </v>

1460
01:27:28.850 --> 01:27:29.683
<v Speaker 1>so that that presupposes the capacity to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make the knowledge that's been gathered </v>

1461
01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:34.873
<v Speaker 1>on the individual route,</v>
<v Speaker 1>accessible to the community and the </v>

1462
01:27:37.641 --> 01:27:38.474
<v Speaker 1>skills that allow that to occur.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it sorta seems different to be </v>

1463
01:27:42.380 --> 01:27:46.160
<v Speaker 1>dealing with the representation of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>group than with a group itself.</v>

1464
01:27:46.970 --> 01:27:47.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1465
01:27:47.730 --> 01:27:50.390
<v Speaker 1>Definitely the whole interaction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the demands,</v>

1466
01:27:50.391 --> 01:27:51.224
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing seemed to be pretty sure</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's all sorts of other things that </v>

1467
01:27:53.931 --> 01:27:54.764
<v Speaker 1>come into play when you're actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing with a person because then it's </v>

1468
01:27:57.321 --> 01:27:58.154
<v Speaker 1>a two way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean then you have to give back as </v>

1469
01:27:59.811 --> 01:28:00.644
<v Speaker 1>well as receive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which seems like a part of what you're </v>

1470
01:28:02.421 --> 01:28:04.370
<v Speaker 1>describing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This process of acculturation.</v>

1471
01:28:04.630 --> 01:28:05.361
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1472
01:28:05.361 --> 01:28:08.280
<v Speaker 1>And there's other things that come into </v>
<v Speaker 1>play to like sexual tensions and,</v>

1473
01:28:08.660 --> 01:28:10.820
<v Speaker 1>and dominance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy maneuvering and,</v>

1474
01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:11.953
<v Speaker 1>and all sorts of other things that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that to be part of a community you have </v>

1475
01:28:15.351 --> 01:28:16.184
<v Speaker 1>to master.</v>

1476
01:28:16.570 --> 01:28:18.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1477
01:28:19.490 --> 01:28:21.260
<v Speaker 3>I'd always thought of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1478
01:28:21.550 --> 01:28:26.550
<v Speaker 3>I think that that's just</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way I see it is.</v>

1479
01:28:27.610 --> 01:28:31.600
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I've always been,</v>

1480
01:28:31.670 --> 01:28:32.503
<v Speaker 3>will be probably a freshman in college.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always thought that details aren't </v>

1481
01:28:34.641 --> 01:28:36.770
<v Speaker 3>important,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so like to look at that,</v>

1482
01:28:37.070 --> 01:28:41.030
<v Speaker 3>what you're saying as a cake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always went for the frosty and instead</v>

1483
01:28:41.031 --> 01:28:46.031
<v Speaker 3>of instead of like the base of the cake </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think that it's possible to,</v>

1484
01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:49.070
<v Speaker 3>to still add to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get a feel for the team.</v>

1485
01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:52.010
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in my experience as an Undergrad,</v>

1486
01:28:52.011 --> 01:28:55.660
<v Speaker 3>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that knowing the details or,</v>

1487
01:28:55.661 --> 01:28:58.370
<v Speaker 3>or going through this is downward </v>
<v Speaker 3>process.</v>

1488
01:28:58.900 --> 01:29:01.780
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it,</v>

1489
01:29:01.781 --> 01:29:04.860
<v Speaker 3>if it makes for a steeper slope,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it does allow you to get.</v>

1490
01:29:04.861 --> 01:29:05.694
<v Speaker 3>There's this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this level here that you just </v>

1491
01:29:06.421 --> 01:29:09.180
<v Speaker 3>can't get to without,</v>
<v Speaker 3>without this.</v>

1492
01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:10.753
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now I want you to tie that more </v>

1493
01:29:12.261 --> 01:29:14.600
<v Speaker 1>concretely into the discussion that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>just have.</v>

1494
01:29:15.180 --> 01:29:16.020
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1495
01:29:16.490 --> 01:29:17.700
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with him,</v>

1496
01:29:17.790 --> 01:29:18.810
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1497
01:29:18.811 --> 01:29:21.540
<v Speaker 3>So what it seems to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you're saying,</v>

1498
01:29:22.230 --> 01:29:22.981
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

1499
01:29:22.981 --> 01:29:26.490
<v Speaker 3>is possibly that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you don't understand,</v>

1500
01:29:27.050 --> 01:29:27.970
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1501
01:29:28.020 --> 01:29:29.430
<v Speaker 3>you're getting a feel for the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the case,</v>

1502
01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:31.140
<v Speaker 3>for the frosting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1503
01:29:31.141 --> 01:29:34.740
<v Speaker 3>and you're saying that maybe you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>need to have a group,</v>

1504
01:29:35.030 --> 01:29:35.840
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1505
01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:39.060
<v Speaker 3>to have to grow on this individuality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can have a mix on it.</v>

1506
01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:41.730
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what I take you to be saying is that</v>

1507
01:29:41.731 --> 01:29:43.440
<v Speaker 3>you need to have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need to,</v>

1508
01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:45.953
<v Speaker 3>you need to know the group fully before </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can go to the highest level of </v>

1509
01:29:48.451 --> 01:29:49.000
<v Speaker 3>industry.</v>

1510
01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:49.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mike,</v>

1511
01:29:49.420 --> 01:29:50.253
<v Speaker 1>I guess the way to specify this could be</v>
<v Speaker 1>to say that isn't ignore the county </v>

1512
01:29:52.980 --> 01:29:53.770
<v Speaker 1>fair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fair enough.</v>

1513
01:29:53.770 --> 01:29:57.420
<v Speaker 1>Fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want them to think the don't</v>

1514
01:29:59.860 --> 01:30:00.693
<v Speaker 1>have the capacity to interact in a group</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's composed of knowledge that's </v>

1515
01:30:04.301 --> 01:30:05.134
<v Speaker 1>implicit and tacit as well as explicit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then if you only go for the explicit </v>

1516
01:30:08.621 --> 01:30:09.454
<v Speaker 1>knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you risk missing the tacit </v>

1517
01:30:11.711 --> 01:30:14.240
<v Speaker 1>knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the stuff that's been so embodied</v>

1518
01:30:14.290 --> 01:30:17.470
<v Speaker 1>say non verbal behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people seem to have different levels</v>

1519
01:30:17.471 --> 01:30:21.050
<v Speaker 1>of ability of transforming explicit </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge into tacit knowledge.</v>

1520
01:30:21.060 --> 01:30:24.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different willingness to do that.</v>

1521
01:30:24.270 --> 01:30:26.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the interplay between the,</v>

1522
01:30:27.290 --> 01:30:28.123
<v Speaker 1>the memory systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ability to go down the hierarchy as </v>

1523
01:30:30.851 --> 01:30:31.870
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that right?</v>

1524
01:30:32.230 --> 01:30:33.063
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well we often don't think down and is </v>

1525
01:30:34.510 --> 01:30:35.920
<v Speaker 1>necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1526
01:30:35.921 --> 01:30:39.210
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's because we take the </v>
<v Speaker 1>attitude that you just described is that</v>

1527
01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:43.030
<v Speaker 1>if you know that if you know the words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to know the music,</v>

1528
01:30:43.490 --> 01:30:45.520
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to know how to put it </v>
<v Speaker 1>into action.</v>

1529
01:30:46.460 --> 01:30:47.293
<v Speaker 1>I think that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's part of the reason that </v>

1530
01:30:48.411 --> 01:30:51.130
<v Speaker 1>actually by the way that the general </v>
<v Speaker 1>public in the USA,</v>

1531
01:30:51.131 --> 01:30:51.964
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holds intellectuals in content is </v>

1532
01:30:54.251 --> 01:30:55.084
<v Speaker 1>because we think the fact is the is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge and that's when you can act </v>

1533
01:31:00.480 --> 01:31:01.313
<v Speaker 1>out the fact you're an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I like woody Allen movies </v>

1534
01:31:04.631 --> 01:31:05.464
<v Speaker 1>actually because woody Allen's </v>
<v Speaker 1>characters are just so stuffed full of </v>

1535
01:31:08.591 --> 01:31:09.424
<v Speaker 1>facts that it's appalling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost completely useless because they </v>

1536
01:31:14.321 --> 01:31:17.320
<v Speaker 1>haven't made the transition down the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>

1537
01:31:18.040 --> 01:31:19.150
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

1538
01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:20.073
<v Speaker 1>Are they confused?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what they confuse his knowledge </v>

1539
01:31:21.671 --> 01:31:22.890
<v Speaker 1>with wisdom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1540
01:31:22.900 --> 01:31:23.733
<v Speaker 1>and that's what academics do in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what intellectual students we think </v>

1541
01:31:26.591 --> 01:31:27.424
<v Speaker 1>because we know facts that were smart </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's dumb because knowing useless </v>

1542
01:31:30.551 --> 01:31:31.810
<v Speaker 1>facts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's stupid.</v>

1543
01:31:33.380 --> 01:31:36.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about gender bumps or.</v>

1544
01:31:36.760 --> 01:31:37.593
<v Speaker 1>So another question about to what extent</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's inculturation is like </v>

1545
01:31:42.221 --> 01:31:43.054
<v Speaker 1>necessarily like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you say that in order to be </v>

1546
01:31:45.550 --> 01:31:46.383
<v Speaker 1>successful artists and do something new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would have to understand all our </v>

1547
01:31:48.630 --> 01:31:49.463
<v Speaker 1>thinking before you or could you like </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of working in isolation still do </v>

1548
01:31:52.571 --> 01:31:52.840
<v Speaker 1>something?</v>

1549
01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:53.930
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>

1550
01:31:54.090 --> 01:31:54.923
<v Speaker 1>that's a tough question because when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're working in isolation you're not </v>

1551
01:31:57.881 --> 01:32:02.881
<v Speaker 1>working in isolation because like say by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time you're 20 or 21 or whatever and</v>

1552
01:32:04.001 --> 01:32:05.530
<v Speaker 1>you're working in isolation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

1553
01:32:05.610 --> 01:32:06.443
<v Speaker 1>your head so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is already stuffed full of your culture </v>

1554
01:32:10.480 --> 01:32:12.760
<v Speaker 1>and many of the things that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>discover,</v>

1555
01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:13.713
<v Speaker 1>you're actually just remembering like </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's already the presuppositions that I </v>

1556
01:32:17.951 --> 01:32:19.210
<v Speaker 1>remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me give you an example.</v>

1557
01:32:20.170 --> 01:32:23.650
<v Speaker 1>The first political science class I took</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was 17,</v>

1558
01:32:24.310 --> 01:32:28.280
<v Speaker 1>I wrote an essay with a friend of mine </v>
<v Speaker 1>that outline the wheat.</v>

1559
01:32:28.410 --> 01:32:31.150
<v Speaker 1>We outline the preconditions for an </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideal state.</v>

1560
01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:32.433
<v Speaker 1>We thought this was very original piece </v>
<v Speaker 1>of work and we handed this to the </v>

1561
01:32:34.721 --> 01:32:35.554
<v Speaker 1>professor and the next week we studied </v>
<v Speaker 1>John Stuart Mill and John Locke and </v>

1562
01:32:40.090 --> 01:32:40.923
<v Speaker 1>everything we had written down was in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their writings and I never read John </v>

1563
01:32:43.630 --> 01:32:44.463
<v Speaker 1>Stewart neuro or John Law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the point is is that what they said </v>

1564
01:32:46.810 --> 01:32:47.643
<v Speaker 1>400 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so much part of everything that we </v>

1565
01:32:49.631 --> 01:32:52.090
<v Speaker 1>do that even if you don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know it.</v>

1566
01:32:52.330 --> 01:32:54.250
<v Speaker 1>So then if you start thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1567
01:32:54.290 --> 01:32:57.940
<v Speaker 1>what constitutes the ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well he ended up doing is recapitulating</v>

1568
01:32:57.941 --> 01:32:59.860
<v Speaker 1>what's already been done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1569
01:33:00.190 --> 01:33:02.410
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like one answer to your question.</v>

1570
01:33:02.411 --> 01:33:04.360
<v Speaker 1>The other answer is I would say in </v>
<v Speaker 1>general,</v>

1571
01:33:05.290 --> 01:33:10.120
<v Speaker 1>keeping in mind Nietzsche's objections </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the more you know about what people</v>

1572
01:33:10.121 --> 01:33:10.954
<v Speaker 1>did before you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the greater your chance of going </v>

1573
01:33:13.541 --> 01:33:15.370
<v Speaker 1>somewhere that no one has ever done </v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

1574
01:33:15.730 --> 01:33:17.710
<v Speaker 1>Because otherwise you risk reinventing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the wheel.</v>

1575
01:33:17.770 --> 01:33:20.310
<v Speaker 1>And it really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in a way that's inefficient.</v>

1576
01:33:20.700 --> 01:33:22.780
<v Speaker 1>Like Einstein,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was Einstein,</v>

1577
01:33:22.781 --> 01:33:23.614
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can see so far because I stood on the </v>

1578
01:33:25.691 --> 01:33:29.980
<v Speaker 1>shoulders of giants and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a reference to the Einstein was a</v>

1579
01:33:29.981 --> 01:33:30.940
<v Speaker 1>revolutionary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1580
01:33:31.240 --> 01:33:32.073
<v Speaker 1>but he still said despite the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a revolutionary and I undermined my </v>

1581
01:33:35.441 --> 01:33:36.274
<v Speaker 1>ancestors so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only reason I ever got there is </v>

1582
01:33:38.521 --> 01:33:40.480
<v Speaker 1>because I knew exactly what they do.</v>

1583
01:33:41.800 --> 01:33:43.720
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the way to go about it.</v>

1584
01:33:45.410 --> 01:33:49.240
<v Speaker 1>One of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that seems to be some,</v>

1585
01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:51.153
<v Speaker 1>it's awkward to talk about this because </v>
<v Speaker 1>we think independence is good and </v>

1586
01:33:54.850 --> 01:33:55.683
<v Speaker 1>dependency is bad and interdependent </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of is some sort of a liminal </v>

1587
01:33:58.841 --> 01:33:59.860
<v Speaker 1>condition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1588
01:33:59.890 --> 01:34:03.160
<v Speaker 1>we don't quite know what to do with in </v>
<v Speaker 1>our culture.</v>

1589
01:34:03.940 --> 01:34:06.700
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me that some of the unease </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that,</v>

1590
01:34:06.701 --> 01:34:07.534
<v Speaker 1>this is related to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I actually wanted to ask about </v>

1591
01:34:09.821 --> 01:34:10.654
<v Speaker 1>gender difference in relation to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>process we're talking about and whether </v>

1592
01:34:14.321 --> 01:34:16.790
<v Speaker 1>that's significant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1593
01:34:17.150 --> 01:34:19.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My guess is that at a,</v>

1594
01:34:20.150 --> 01:34:22.790
<v Speaker 1>at a fundamental level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say probably not.</v>

1595
01:34:23.900 --> 01:34:24.733
<v Speaker 1>Whether there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where were you thinking about gender </v>

1596
01:34:27.681 --> 01:34:32.010
<v Speaker 1>differences in relationship to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the group connection,</v>

1597
01:34:32.011 --> 01:34:35.780
<v Speaker 1>that group experience and what the group</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience is like an adolescent?</v>

1598
01:34:35.900 --> 01:34:36.733
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there are probably gender </v>

1599
01:34:37.701 --> 01:34:38.900
<v Speaker 1>differences in adolescence.</v>

1600
01:34:38.900 --> 01:34:42.900
<v Speaker 1>Partly because women hit puberty like </v>
<v Speaker 1>two years earlier than men do.</v>

1601
01:34:43.190 --> 01:34:45.710
<v Speaker 1>I think that that makes quite a quite a </v>
<v Speaker 1>big difference.</v>

1602
01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:46.873
<v Speaker 1>So there are groups get fragmented </v>
<v Speaker 1>earlier about what difference that </v>

1603
01:34:50.151 --> 01:34:51.020
<v Speaker 1>makes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1604
01:34:51.170 --> 01:34:54.230
<v Speaker 1>but I would suspect that it's a severe </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough difference to,</v>

1605
01:34:54.830 --> 01:34:55.663
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have some at least short term </v>

1606
01:34:58.161 --> 01:35:02.870
<v Speaker 1>implications.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean girls hit puberty at 12 or 13,</v>

1607
01:35:02.930 --> 01:35:03.763
<v Speaker 1>14 and two years later for boys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so by the time boys have to deal with </v>

1608
01:35:07.701 --> 01:35:08.534
<v Speaker 1>all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are two years older and have two </v>

1609
01:35:10.041 --> 01:35:12.020
<v Speaker 1>years more experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

1610
01:35:12.021 --> 01:35:12.854
<v Speaker 1>I think what happens to girls peer </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships is that when they hit </v>

1611
01:35:14.631 --> 01:35:15.464
<v Speaker 1>puberty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they start associating immediately with </v>

1612
01:35:16.881 --> 01:35:17.714
<v Speaker 1>older boys two or three years older.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course then they're immediately put </v>

1613
01:35:20.811 --> 01:35:21.644
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least at temporarily subordinate </v>

1614
01:35:23.211 --> 01:35:24.044
<v Speaker 1>position and they don't get a chance to </v>
<v Speaker 1>develop their peer network groups quite </v>

1615
01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:27.673
<v Speaker 1>to the same degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas boys have to kind of do that by </v>

1616
01:35:29.151 --> 01:35:31.160
<v Speaker 1>default,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe when they're 13 or whatever,</v>

1617
01:35:31.161 --> 01:35:33.980
<v Speaker 1>they'd rather be associated with girls </v>
<v Speaker 1>have their own age,</v>

1618
01:35:33.981 --> 01:35:35.390
<v Speaker 1>but the girls will have anything to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>with them,</v>

1619
01:35:35.660 --> 01:35:40.340
<v Speaker 1>so it was like while they're off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're off together by default.</v>

1620
01:35:40.760 --> 01:35:44.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what that means in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>final analysis.</v>

1621
01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:49.610
<v Speaker 5>I'm</v>
<v Speaker 5>thinking subjectively that</v>

1622
01:35:51.110 --> 01:35:56.110
<v Speaker 5>making powerful gender differences in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the entire story all along the line.</v>

1623
01:35:58.100 --> 01:36:01.710
<v Speaker 5>Just that could be a topic that might </v>
<v Speaker 5>come back to it at the end of the.</v>

1624
01:36:02.780 --> 01:36:03.613
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well if you have ideas about that that </v>

1625
01:36:05.410 --> 01:36:06.243
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that would be a really useful topic for </v>

1626
01:36:07.171 --> 01:36:08.190
<v Speaker 5>an essay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

1627
01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:11.520
<v Speaker 5>if you want to explore that more </v>
<v Speaker 5>thoroughly because the gender issue is.</v>

1628
01:36:11.970 --> 01:36:14.560
<v Speaker 5>Well first of all there is gender </v>
<v Speaker 5>problem,</v>

1629
01:36:14.561 --> 01:36:16.920
<v Speaker 5>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He looked at classical religious,</v>

1630
01:36:17.100 --> 01:36:17.933
<v Speaker 5>western religious traditions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's big gender issues occurring </v>

1631
01:36:20.341 --> 01:36:21.174
<v Speaker 5>there all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The central figure in Christianity is </v>

1632
01:36:22.861 --> 01:36:23.694
<v Speaker 5>male and this is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is troublesome for even from the </v>

1633
01:36:26.311 --> 01:36:28.680
<v Speaker 5>perspective of ritual invitation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's troublesome.</v>

1634
01:36:28.950 --> 01:36:30.960
<v Speaker 5>You also.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It also does seem to me the case,</v>

1635
01:36:30.961 --> 01:36:35.220
<v Speaker 5>they didn't mythology as a general rule,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the figure of the hero is represented as</v>

1636
01:36:35.221 --> 01:36:36.054
<v Speaker 5>masking so and I don't know what that </v>
<v Speaker 5>means for for it doesn't mean that </v>

1637
01:36:40.321 --> 01:36:41.160
<v Speaker 5>heroes are map.</v>

1638
01:36:41.610 --> 01:36:45.660
<v Speaker 5>It certainly doesn't mean that in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>sense it does because you have to ask</v>

1639
01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:50.040
<v Speaker 5>to ask about the culture.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your culture is represented as the great</v>

1640
01:36:50.041 --> 01:36:54.780
<v Speaker 5>father and right to think that we have a</v>
<v Speaker 5>patriarchal culture in the west.</v>

1641
01:36:55.220 --> 01:36:56.053
<v Speaker 5>I think we've talked about individual </v>
<v Speaker 5>stories and there are some very </v>

1642
01:36:59.491 --> 01:37:00.324
<v Speaker 5>important developmental differences </v>
<v Speaker 5>between boys and girls that I think </v>

1643
01:37:02.990 --> 01:37:03.823
<v Speaker 5>we're the last,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe in the seventies and eighties we </v>

1644
01:37:05.941 --> 01:37:06.774
<v Speaker 5>weren't willing to investigate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but now maybe we are in the field of </v>

1645
01:37:09.631 --> 01:37:14.310
<v Speaker 5>psychology and one of those is that boys</v>
<v Speaker 5>have to need their mothers girls.</v>

1646
01:37:14.700 --> 01:37:15.533
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1647
01:37:15.650 --> 01:37:20.650
<v Speaker 5>And a lot of the themes of the course in</v>
<v Speaker 5>terms of the terror like your nephew,</v>

1648
01:37:21.810 --> 01:37:22.643
<v Speaker 5>he's terrifying dreams of having to go </v>
<v Speaker 5>out on its own and here or having to </v>

1649
01:37:25.771 --> 01:37:26.604
<v Speaker 5>leave and having to kill his mother.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All of these seem to be very tied into </v>

1650
01:37:30.810 --> 01:37:34.500
<v Speaker 5>this masculine experience of having to </v>
<v Speaker 5>leave.</v>

1651
01:37:34.890 --> 01:37:36.320
<v Speaker 5>One's mother,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

1652
01:37:36.330 --> 01:37:41.330
<v Speaker 5>in a lot of monkey colonies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the unveils how often it's two girls,</v>

1653
01:37:41.441 --> 01:37:42.900
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The girls don't have to leave.</v>

1654
01:37:43.530 --> 01:37:45.600
<v Speaker 5>I think very different developmental </v>
<v Speaker 5>perspective.</v>

1655
01:37:45.601 --> 01:37:46.960
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't mean it goes to get along </v>
<v Speaker 5>with them.</v>

1656
01:37:46.990 --> 01:37:49.860
<v Speaker 5>Others,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it just means you never expected to make</v>

1657
01:37:49.861 --> 01:37:51.620
<v Speaker 5>that break.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Boys are.</v>

1658
01:37:51.720 --> 01:37:52.553
<v Speaker 5>You never put in that same position and </v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that it's also the case boy's </v>

1659
01:37:55.441 --> 01:37:56.040
<v Speaker 5>initiation.</v>

1660
01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:56.873
<v Speaker 1>Rituals tend to be much more violent </v>
<v Speaker 1>than dramatic than those girls and I </v>

1661
01:37:59.911 --> 01:38:00.744
<v Speaker 1>think you've said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it is very much for this reason </v>

1662
01:38:02.370 --> 01:38:03.203
<v Speaker 1>because there a break that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>more severe break that necessarily has </v>

1663
01:38:06.211 --> 01:38:07.044
<v Speaker 1>to be made or this has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This has really profound implications </v>

1664
01:38:09.721 --> 01:38:12.870
<v Speaker 1>for the constructions of ideals too </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it seems to me,</v>

1665
01:38:13.050 --> 01:38:15.030
<v Speaker 1>this is my own personal opinion of </v>
<v Speaker 1>course,</v>

1666
01:38:15.540 --> 01:38:17.520
<v Speaker 1>but it seems to me that the feminist </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement,</v>

1667
01:38:17.521 --> 01:38:21.150
<v Speaker 1>especially in the sixties and seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>miss the boat in some regards,</v>

1668
01:38:21.180 --> 01:38:22.013
<v Speaker 1>bike presuming that the male pattern of </v>
<v Speaker 1>development and construction of the </v>

1669
01:38:26.341 --> 01:38:27.174
<v Speaker 1>patriarchal society necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>constituted an ideal form of behavior </v>

1670
01:38:31.410 --> 01:38:33.360
<v Speaker 1>and one that women would do well to </v>
<v Speaker 1>emulate.</v>

1671
01:38:33.900 --> 01:38:36.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can say that separately from saying</v>

1672
01:38:36.430 --> 01:38:37.263
<v Speaker 5>from,</v>
<v Speaker 5>from.</v>

1673
01:38:38.630 --> 01:38:41.110
<v Speaker 5>You can say that separately.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1674
01:38:42.290 --> 01:38:45.920
<v Speaker 5>I'm not so sure about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1675
01:38:45.960 --> 01:38:46.793
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this,</v>

1676
01:38:46.890 --> 01:38:48.330
<v Speaker 1>this is an issue obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's,</v>

1677
01:38:48.340 --> 01:38:52.110
<v Speaker 1>there's all sorts of area for debate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's my general impression.</v>

1678
01:38:52.440 --> 01:38:56.640
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just an absolutely useful,</v>

1679
01:38:56.740 --> 01:38:59.040
<v Speaker 1>useful topic and I don't know how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>address it from.</v>

1680
01:38:59.330 --> 01:39:03.090
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that's interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>with regards to this though is that it's</v>

1681
01:39:03.091 --> 01:39:06.010
<v Speaker 1>not so much the case in this class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most of us students</v>

1682
01:39:06.580 --> 01:39:11.580
<v Speaker 5>were women and the appeal of his writing</v>
<v Speaker 5>has generally been to women.</v>

1683
01:39:12.200 --> 01:39:13.860
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't.</v>

1684
01:39:13.870 --> 01:39:18.190
<v Speaker 5>Why that is exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's more here relates to</v>

1685
01:39:20.590 --> 01:39:21.423
<v Speaker 5>extract information and I think that has</v>
<v Speaker 5>to do a lot with like the historical </v>

1686
01:39:24.551 --> 01:39:25.384
<v Speaker 5>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that women and men experienced </v>

1687
01:39:27.261 --> 01:39:28.094
<v Speaker 5>our historical moment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>adolescent funimation identity in such </v>

1688
01:39:31.391 --> 01:39:32.224
<v Speaker 5>different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like due to a large project managers </v>

1689
01:39:34.720 --> 01:39:35.553
<v Speaker 5>yanked away from their mothers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his boys and then they have to go </v>

1690
01:39:37.751 --> 01:39:38.940
<v Speaker 5>through this initiatory.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1691
01:39:39.220 --> 01:39:42.560
<v Speaker 5>And then they see women no longer his </v>
<v Speaker 5>mother but his mate,</v>

1692
01:39:42.940 --> 01:39:45.200
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for reproduction to Marin and perpetuate</v>

1693
01:39:45.201 --> 01:39:50.201
<v Speaker 5>society or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the point being is that not only j,</v>

1694
01:39:51.190 --> 01:39:55.480
<v Speaker 5>they have very different experiences so </v>
<v Speaker 5>that like the feminist movement,</v>

1695
01:39:55.481 --> 01:39:56.314
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't parallelize the woman's </v>

1696
01:39:58.091 --> 01:40:02.350
<v Speaker 5>experience to a man's experience so that</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the way young interprets,</v>

1697
01:40:02.351 --> 01:40:04.090
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>life is just,</v>

1698
01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:08.030
<v Speaker 5>it's more effective to a woman because,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1699
01:40:08.031 --> 01:40:08.864
<v Speaker 5>he deals with women are socialized in </v>
<v Speaker 5>much different ways that you can deal </v>

1700
01:40:11.940 --> 01:40:16.300
<v Speaker 5>with issues relating much more to a </v>
<v Speaker 5>women as a woman does,</v>

1701
01:40:16.301 --> 01:40:18.130
<v Speaker 5>where history is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1702
01:40:18.460 --> 01:40:20.920
<v Speaker 5>historically dominated by men and man </v>
<v Speaker 5>creates history.</v>

1703
01:40:20.920 --> 01:40:21.753
<v Speaker 5>So what do you think it is about his </v>
<v Speaker 5>writings and make making in particular </v>

1704
01:40:24.280 --> 01:40:26.080
<v Speaker 5>more attractive to women?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1705
01:40:26.430 --> 01:40:27.263
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1706
01:40:27.350 --> 01:40:30.850
<v Speaker 5>they're so interesting to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're just fascinating because I think</v>

1707
01:40:30.851 --> 01:40:33.180
<v Speaker 5>it's just because it's more,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1708
01:40:33.620 --> 01:40:35.080
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe you know,</v>

1709
01:40:35.170 --> 01:40:37.300
<v Speaker 5>you're sold or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just,</v>

1710
01:40:37.330 --> 01:40:40.630
<v Speaker 5>it's not really something you can </v>
<v Speaker 5>articulate very well.</v>

1711
01:40:40.631 --> 01:40:41.464
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1712
01:40:41.830 --> 01:40:44.240
<v Speaker 5>I guess just his references to um,</v>

1713
01:40:44.890 --> 01:40:45.290
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1714
01:40:45.290 --> 01:40:46.123
<v Speaker 1>you believe that you don't believe that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of thinking of how things were </v>

1715
01:40:50.921 --> 01:40:51.754
<v Speaker 1>connected was more intrinsically </v>
<v Speaker 1>attracted women than the idea of things </v>

1716
01:40:54.760 --> 01:40:55.593
<v Speaker 1>of how things are different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the masculine consciousness has a </v>

1717
01:40:58.001 --> 01:41:02.470
<v Speaker 1>discriminative quality which cuts things</v>
<v Speaker 1>into pieces and I think that might be.</v>

1718
01:41:02.620 --> 01:41:03.453
<v Speaker 1>I think that might because males are </v>
<v Speaker 1>more bilaterally split in there </v>

1719
01:41:06.091 --> 01:41:07.240
<v Speaker 1>hemisphere as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1720
01:41:07.290 --> 01:41:08.123
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that the idea that that </v>

1721
01:41:09.431 --> 01:41:11.170
<v Speaker 1>represents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I know that that's not,</v>

1722
01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:13.480
<v Speaker 1>that's somewhat speculative in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>physiology,</v>

1723
01:41:13.481 --> 01:41:14.314
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of the strength of the </v>

1724
01:41:16.331 --> 01:41:18.310
<v Speaker 1>masculine identity with the semantic </v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

1725
01:41:18.820 --> 01:41:20.620
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a possibility.</v>

1726
01:41:20.621 --> 01:41:21.454
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I was going to speculate in their </v>

1727
01:41:22.100 --> 01:41:22.933
<v Speaker 1>direction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's probably the path down which I </v>

1728
01:41:24.671 --> 01:41:25.820
<v Speaker 1>would go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1729
01:41:27.900 --> 01:41:29.420
<v Speaker 1>what's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Smaller?</v>

1730
01:41:30.340 --> 01:41:32.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's.</v>

1731
01:41:32.290 --> 01:41:33.790
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1732
01:41:33.900 --> 01:41:34.733
<v Speaker 1>One other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wanna I to pop some ideas out </v>

1733
01:41:37.300 --> 01:41:38.133
<v Speaker 1>with relationship to this before we </v>
<v Speaker 1>close out the class because I really </v>

1734
01:41:40.781 --> 01:41:42.910
<v Speaker 1>want you to think about this because </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is important.</v>

1735
01:41:43.510 --> 01:41:45.880
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1736
01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:47.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

1737
01:41:47.770 --> 01:41:51.880
<v Speaker 1>if you're searching for information </v>
<v Speaker 1>about how to behave well,</v>

1738
01:41:51.881 --> 01:41:52.714
<v Speaker 1>that's a search for wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the question that sort of underlies </v>

1739
01:41:55.240 --> 01:41:58.360
<v Speaker 1>the search for wisdom is an internal </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophical question.</v>

1740
01:41:58.690 --> 01:41:59.523
<v Speaker 1>Then the question is what is the good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I try to make something of this and </v>

1741
01:42:02.711 --> 01:42:03.544
<v Speaker 1>this manuscript because I think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>posing the question in that way has </v>

1742
01:42:05.741 --> 01:42:06.574
<v Speaker 1>caused us a lot of trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I would say that like if you're </v>

1743
01:42:09.761 --> 01:42:10.451
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1744
01:42:10.451 --> 01:42:11.284
<v Speaker 1>so mom's gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you're not a child anymore and </v>

1745
01:42:13.361 --> 01:42:15.180
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she can't solve your problems anymore.</v>

1746
01:42:15.190 --> 01:42:17.560
<v Speaker 1>And that has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just the way it is.</v>

1747
01:42:17.561 --> 01:42:18.394
<v Speaker 1>You're too big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you're here in this chaotic </v>

1748
01:42:21.880 --> 01:42:22.713
<v Speaker 1>intermediary position and someone comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>along and this is what initiation </v>

1749
01:42:26.201 --> 01:42:27.034
<v Speaker 1>rituals do.</v>

1750
01:42:27.180 --> 01:42:28.013
<v Speaker 1>They tear the boys and the women all cry</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the boys are gone and when they </v>

1751
01:42:31.361 --> 01:42:33.190
<v Speaker 1>come back they're going to be again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the truth.</v>

1752
01:42:33.191 --> 01:42:34.710
<v Speaker 1>So when they acquitted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they cried,</v>

1753
01:42:34.810 --> 01:42:35.643
<v Speaker 1>they made it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The boys are taken out away from their </v>

1754
01:42:37.511 --> 01:42:39.280
<v Speaker 1>mother and they're terrified half to </v>
<v Speaker 1>death,</v>

1755
01:42:39.700 --> 01:42:41.350
<v Speaker 1>which is basically what happens to </v>
<v Speaker 1>marines.</v>

1756
01:42:41.351 --> 01:42:44.180
<v Speaker 1>We need to put through bootcamp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then for precisely the same raises,</v>

1757
01:42:44.190 --> 01:42:46.750
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're no longer child will </v>
<v Speaker 1>put you through the ringer.</v>

1758
01:42:46.930 --> 01:42:48.000
<v Speaker 1>Your old identities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1759
01:42:48.280 --> 01:42:49.113
<v Speaker 1>it has to be killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll kill it because it's better than </v>

1760
01:42:51.041 --> 01:42:55.340
<v Speaker 1>it dies now than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It hangs around with 20 years torturing,</v>

1761
01:42:55.420 --> 01:42:56.253
<v Speaker 1>which is what it would do otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we'll just scare the hell out of you </v>

1762
01:42:58.780 --> 01:42:59.613
<v Speaker 1>and put you in a very suggestible state </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what would have suggested estate </v>

1763
01:43:02.630 --> 01:43:03.071
<v Speaker 1>paid?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1764
01:43:03.071 --> 01:43:03.904
<v Speaker 1>I would say I'm going to strip away all </v>
<v Speaker 1>your past beliefs and put you in a </v>

1765
01:43:06.611 --> 01:43:07.444
<v Speaker 1>situation you've never been in before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to say you've always been </v>

1766
01:43:09.551 --> 01:43:12.700
<v Speaker 1>afraid of the dark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but mom was always there,</v>

1767
01:43:13.240 --> 01:43:14.073
<v Speaker 1>so now I'm going to do is find the </v>
<v Speaker 1>darkest and most frightening place that </v>

1768
01:43:16.571 --> 01:43:19.340
<v Speaker 1>I can possibly imagine and I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>put you in it,</v>

1769
01:43:19.780 --> 01:43:22.060
<v Speaker 1>and that's what people do and initiation</v>
<v Speaker 1>ceremonies.</v>

1770
01:43:22.060 --> 01:43:23.170
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a.</v>

1771
01:43:23.200 --> 01:43:25.240
<v Speaker 1>here's a case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what the hell is in it.</v>

1772
01:43:25.330 --> 01:43:26.830
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

1773
01:43:26.831 --> 01:43:31.330
<v Speaker 1>there is one that your imagination is </v>
<v Speaker 1>put there and it's the worst monster you</v>

1774
01:43:31.331 --> 01:43:33.370
<v Speaker 1>can think of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where you're going,</v>

1775
01:43:33.880 --> 01:43:37.510
<v Speaker 1>so we're going to put you in there till </v>
<v Speaker 1>till you discover that although you feel</v>

1776
01:43:37.511 --> 01:43:39.430
<v Speaker 1>that you're going to go crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you won't.</v>

1777
01:43:40.630 --> 01:43:41.463
<v Speaker 1>That's your heightened state of </v>
<v Speaker 1>suggestibility is I'm in a place where </v>

1778
01:43:44.891 --> 01:43:47.920
<v Speaker 1>nothing makes sense and put me because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never felt this before.</v>

1779
01:43:48.340 --> 01:43:50.140
<v Speaker 1>What do I want?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want an answer.</v>

1780
01:43:50.800 --> 01:43:52.650
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when inculturation of course,</v>

1781
01:43:52.651 --> 01:43:56.330
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're no longer a child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the mysteries of the tribe.</v>

1782
01:43:57.140 --> 01:43:59.620
<v Speaker 1>That's your new story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's brainwashing.</v>

1783
01:44:00.010 --> 01:44:00.843
<v Speaker 1>We proceeded so you're all chaotic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want me to story including one that </v>

1784
01:44:03.681 --> 01:44:05.540
<v Speaker 1>will cover everything that you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced.</v>

1785
01:44:05.750 --> 01:44:08.060
<v Speaker 1>Someone comes along and hands it to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>on a silver plate.</v>

1786
01:44:08.450 --> 01:44:10.550
<v Speaker 1>You take it in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's your inculturation.</v>

1787
01:44:10.551 --> 01:44:13.400
<v Speaker 1>So now you're an adult and your standard</v>
<v Speaker 1>bear of the community.</v>

1788
01:44:13.730 --> 01:44:14.570
<v Speaker 1>So you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1789
01:44:14.571 --> 01:44:19.571
<v Speaker 1>the question here is being a child is no</v>
<v Speaker 1>longer an answer to your problem.</v>

1790
01:44:19.820 --> 01:44:20.653
<v Speaker 1>So the next problem is what is the good?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's conceived of as a concrete </v>

1791
01:44:26.530 --> 01:44:30.640
<v Speaker 1>question and their answer is our </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

1792
01:44:31.040 --> 01:44:34.220
<v Speaker 1>So that's where the human being Smith </v>
<v Speaker 1>and many cultures,</v>

1793
01:44:35.690 --> 01:44:36.523
<v Speaker 1>the word many cultures used for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>members of that culture is the word </v>

1794
01:44:39.381 --> 01:44:40.214
<v Speaker 1>that's the equivalent to human,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that if you're from this </v>

1795
01:44:42.321 --> 01:44:43.340
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're human.</v>

1796
01:44:43.580 --> 01:44:46.670
<v Speaker 1>If you're from another culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whatever you are isn't human.</v>

1797
01:44:46.700 --> 01:44:48.170
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something that's sort of looks like</v>

1798
01:44:48.460 --> 01:44:49.293
<v Speaker 1>but partakes more of the domain of </v>
<v Speaker 1>novelty than of the domain of the </v>

1799
01:44:52.611 --> 01:44:53.930
<v Speaker 1>encountered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1800
01:44:56.350 --> 01:44:59.990
<v Speaker 1>given culture is a specific answer to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the general question.</v>

1801
01:45:00.200 --> 01:45:01.033
<v Speaker 1>What is the good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's the question that's answered </v>

1802
01:45:03.081 --> 01:45:05.570
<v Speaker 1>when you make the transition from </v>
<v Speaker 1>childhood to adolescence.</v>

1803
01:45:06.680 --> 01:45:10.160
<v Speaker 1>We know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that an answer to the question,</v>

1804
01:45:10.161 --> 01:45:12.410
<v Speaker 1>what is the goodest troublesome say in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Old Testament,</v>

1805
01:45:12.411 --> 01:45:13.244
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it says,</v>

1806
01:45:13.400 --> 01:45:15.590
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't make an idol out of God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

1807
01:45:15.650 --> 01:45:17.660
<v Speaker 1>No graven images.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And why is that?</v>

1808
01:45:17.930 --> 01:45:18.763
<v Speaker 1>Because you shouldn't confuse the </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstract thing with the concrete thing </v>

1809
01:45:21.620 --> 01:45:23.840
<v Speaker 1>and the problem with the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the good,</v>

1810
01:45:23.841 --> 01:45:24.674
<v Speaker 1>which is a question that western </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy is being trained to address </v>

1811
01:45:27.530 --> 01:45:28.363
<v Speaker 1>4,000 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that it presumes that there is an </v>

1812
01:45:30.171 --> 01:45:31.004
<v Speaker 1>answer to a question like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to say that in the way the </v>

1813
01:45:33.771 --> 01:45:34.604
<v Speaker 1>question is phrased,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an implicit presumption that it </v>

1814
01:45:37.551 --> 01:45:38.384
<v Speaker 1>can be answered in that form and I would</v>
<v Speaker 1>say that when you adopt a group </v>

1815
01:45:41.901 --> 01:45:44.660
<v Speaker 1>identity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you've answered,</v>

1816
01:45:45.080 --> 01:45:45.913
<v Speaker 1>but there is a better question and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the question that you answered when you </v>

1817
01:45:48.651 --> 01:45:50.420
<v Speaker 1>make it to the next step.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you say,</v>

1818
01:45:50.421 --> 01:45:53.270
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos group identification,</v>

1819
01:45:53.450 --> 01:45:54.560
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's your solution.</v>

1820
01:45:54.800 --> 01:45:55.970
<v Speaker 1>What is the good?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1821
01:45:55.971 --> 01:45:57.650
<v Speaker 1>here's a whole bunch of rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1822
01:45:57.800 --> 01:45:58.633
<v Speaker 1>Those are concrete representations of </v>
<v Speaker 1>how you should behave and what </v>

1823
01:46:00.960 --> 01:46:03.680
<v Speaker 1>constitutes good and evil from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular perspective,</v>

1824
01:46:04.340 --> 01:46:07.280
<v Speaker 1>but then there's another question that </v>
<v Speaker 1>might rear its ugly head later,</v>

1825
01:46:07.640 --> 01:46:10.790
<v Speaker 1>which is a much more profound question </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is the question.</v>

1826
01:46:11.960 --> 01:46:16.490
<v Speaker 1>What is the nature of the process?</v>
<v Speaker 1>By which answers to the question,</v>

1827
01:46:16.700 --> 01:46:19.840
<v Speaker 1>what is the good are formulated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1828
01:46:20.150 --> 01:46:20.983
<v Speaker 1>It's a medical question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it says not what's the answer to the </v>

1829
01:46:23.661 --> 01:46:24.494
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what's the nature of the procedure </v>

1830
01:46:27.200 --> 01:46:28.033
<v Speaker 1>that you engage in when you're answering</v>
<v Speaker 1>the questions which you really have to </v>

1831
01:46:31.011 --> 01:46:31.844
<v Speaker 1>know because the question what is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>good shifts with environmental </v>

1832
01:46:34.371 --> 01:46:37.070
<v Speaker 1>circumstance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to say that what's good for you</v>

1833
01:46:37.071 --> 01:46:37.904
<v Speaker 1>one day is not necessarily good for you </v>
<v Speaker 1>the next day or what's good for your </v>

1834
01:46:40.041 --> 01:46:43.040
<v Speaker 1>culture now like do it in 100 years.</v>

1835
01:46:43.580 --> 01:46:47.090
<v Speaker 1>So if you answered the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the good with an answer,</v>

1836
01:46:47.510 --> 01:46:48.343
<v Speaker 1>then you've already made an error </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the answer presupposes that </v>

1837
01:46:51.931 --> 01:46:55.200
<v Speaker 1>there isn't permanent answer to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>question and that's wrong.</v>

1838
01:46:55.590 --> 01:46:56.423
<v Speaker 1>So I would say</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you get to this level of the whole </v>

1839
01:46:59.820 --> 01:47:00.653
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the next stage beyond your </v>

1840
01:47:02.281 --> 01:47:05.010
<v Speaker 1>cultural identification,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're looking for,</v>

1841
01:47:05.610 --> 01:47:10.610
<v Speaker 1>is it a description of the process that </v>
<v Speaker 1>leads you to be able to answer questions</v>

1842
01:47:11.310 --> 01:47:12.143
<v Speaker 1>of the sort?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is when you have to update them </v>

1843
01:47:14.700 --> 01:47:15.533
<v Speaker 1>constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say that why do you </v>

1844
01:47:16.801 --> 01:47:17.634
<v Speaker 1>identify with when you moved to here is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the process by which these structures </v>

1845
01:47:23.311 --> 01:47:24.144
<v Speaker 1>are actually January.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's the process that you read </v>

1846
01:47:26.310 --> 01:47:27.143
<v Speaker 1>stories itself and that that gives you </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the wisdom that you already have as </v>

1847
01:47:31.951 --> 01:47:32.784
<v Speaker 1>a consequence of your cultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>identification with the additional </v>

1848
01:47:35.371 --> 01:47:39.320
<v Speaker 1>knowledge that you're also the one that </v>
<v Speaker 1>builds the stories.</v>

1849
01:47:40.020 --> 01:47:42.610
<v Speaker 1>That's where your central point of </v>
<v Speaker 1>identification can be.</v>

1850
01:47:42.750 --> 01:47:44.710
<v Speaker 1>So then if you say you're involved in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1851
01:47:44.711 --> 01:47:45.181
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1852
01:47:45.181 --> 01:47:45.720
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1853
01:47:45.720 --> 01:47:46.553
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in settling a dispute between people </v>

1854
01:47:48.871 --> 01:47:51.600
<v Speaker 1>from two different cultural positions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is,</v>

1855
01:47:51.601 --> 01:47:52.434
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that person a and person b are </v>

1856
01:47:54.841 --> 01:47:55.674
<v Speaker 1>both exemplary</v>
<v Speaker 1>representatives of their particular </v>

1857
01:47:59.941 --> 01:48:01.980
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're at odds with one another.</v>

1858
01:48:02.250 --> 01:48:03.720
<v Speaker 1>So then the question then is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1859
01:48:03.810 --> 01:48:07.110
<v Speaker 1>what constitutes common ground?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you need a position.</v>

1860
01:48:07.170 --> 01:48:09.310
<v Speaker 1>Remember we were asking and wondering </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the,</v>

1861
01:48:09.690 --> 01:48:11.790
<v Speaker 1>what's the issue?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's one story.</v>

1862
01:48:11.940 --> 01:48:12.773
<v Speaker 1>Here's another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not the same as a consequence </v>

1863
01:48:17.010 --> 01:48:17.843
<v Speaker 1>like traveling is breaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well we don't know what going to </v>

1864
01:48:21.051 --> 01:48:24.060
<v Speaker 1>maneuver over here where there are no </v>
<v Speaker 1>rules.</v>

1865
01:48:25.230 --> 01:48:28.020
<v Speaker 1>It's great because neither side excepts </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rules on the other side.</v>

1866
01:48:28.021 --> 01:48:29.190
<v Speaker 1>So then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1867
01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:30.353
<v Speaker 1>what are the rules that allow you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>maneuver when you're outside the place </v>

1868
01:48:32.641 --> 01:48:33.600
<v Speaker 1>that there are rules?</v>

1869
01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:34.351
<v Speaker 1>And I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1870
01:48:34.351 --> 01:48:35.184
<v Speaker 1>I would hope that I could appeal to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>on a general basis and as someone who's </v>

1871
01:48:39.060 --> 01:48:43.320
<v Speaker 1>not only an exemplar of the culture as </v>
<v Speaker 1>specified territory,</v>

1872
01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:44.513
<v Speaker 1>but an exemplar of those members of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture who had enough courage to </v>

1873
01:48:47.851 --> 01:48:48.684
<v Speaker 1>construct the culture to begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the place where we hope to </v>

1874
01:48:51.601 --> 01:48:54.660
<v Speaker 1>operate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I would also hope to be able to</v>

1875
01:48:54.661 --> 01:48:58.110
<v Speaker 1>say to you that your culture differs </v>
<v Speaker 1>from my culture,</v>

1876
01:48:58.140 --> 01:48:58.973
<v Speaker 1>but were there the same is that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were both directed by people who had </v>

1877
01:49:02.461 --> 01:49:03.294
<v Speaker 1>enough courage to erect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you really want to identify </v>

1878
01:49:06.601 --> 01:49:09.750
<v Speaker 1>with your culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you stop identifying with the rules</v>

1879
01:49:10.230 --> 01:49:11.063
<v Speaker 1>and you start identifying with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>process and also to the degree that you </v>

1880
01:49:14.341 --> 01:49:15.174
<v Speaker 1>want me to identify with the rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you stop yourself from identifying with </v>

1881
01:49:18.301 --> 01:49:19.134
<v Speaker 1>the process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people are not those courageous </v>

1882
01:49:21.901 --> 01:49:22.734
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1883
01:49:23.230 --> 01:49:24.063
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think partly it's a problem of </v>

1884
01:49:26.521 --> 01:49:31.521
<v Speaker 1>conceptualization is that until you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>perceive the possibility.</v>

1885
01:49:32.700 --> 01:49:34.500
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to stop kids,</v>

1886
01:49:34.501 --> 01:49:35.370
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

1887
01:49:35.371 --> 01:49:36.204
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from forming gangs and from proceeding </v>

1888
01:49:38.701 --> 01:49:39.534
<v Speaker 1>morally within the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But immorally with regards to the rest </v>

1889
01:49:41.821 --> 01:49:44.280
<v Speaker 1>of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that saying to them,</v>

1890
01:49:44.281 --> 01:49:45.114
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way that you construct your game is </v>

1891
01:49:46.351 --> 01:49:48.250
<v Speaker 1>inappropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to work because they need the</v>

1892
01:49:48.251 --> 01:49:49.084
<v Speaker 1>gangs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what you might be able to say as </v>

1893
01:49:50.590 --> 01:49:51.423
<v Speaker 1>well what you think you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think what you're doing is the most </v>

1894
01:49:53.801 --> 01:49:57.160
<v Speaker 1>courageous thing that can be done </v>
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of gang activity,</v>

1895
01:49:57.161 --> 01:49:58.390
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is quite dangerous.</v>

1896
01:49:58.990 --> 01:49:59.890
<v Speaker 1>But then you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1897
01:49:59.891 --> 01:50:02.860
<v Speaker 1>it's not his.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a whole other realm of courage.</v>

1898
01:50:03.010 --> 01:50:05.020
<v Speaker 1>It's outside of the domain that you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>considered.</v>

1899
01:50:05.140 --> 01:50:07.960
<v Speaker 1>It's much more difficult and if you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>a real human being,</v>

1900
01:50:07.961 --> 01:50:09.940
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you do.</v>

1901
01:50:10.510 --> 01:50:13.600
<v Speaker 1>Because if you want to offer someone an </v>
<v Speaker 1>option and have them take it,</v>

1902
01:50:13.690 --> 01:50:16.090
<v Speaker 1>I think you have to offer them something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's more difficult.</v>

1903
01:50:16.930 --> 01:50:19.270
<v Speaker 1>The moral equivalent board or if that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1904
01:50:19.560 --> 01:50:21.630
<v Speaker 1>that's the moral equivalent of war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1905
01:50:22.210 --> 01:50:24.250
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is something that's just</v>

1906
01:50:24.251 --> 01:50:29.251
<v Speaker 1>as excited and just as dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But where did the territory's different?</v>

1907
01:50:30.870 --> 01:50:31.703
<v Speaker 1>The problem is worried something </v>
<v Speaker 1>procedural and therefore it's easy to </v>

1908
01:50:33.311 --> 01:50:34.144
<v Speaker 1>grasp as an alternative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas this is something that's </v>

1909
01:50:35.361 --> 01:50:36.194
<v Speaker 1>correct.</v>
