1
00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.200
<v Speaker 1>If you don't have a goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you suffer.</v>

2
00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.960
<v Speaker 1>And then you get cruel and bitter and </v>
<v Speaker 1>resentful and then you start to actively</v>

3
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.620
<v Speaker 1>try to make the world a worse place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

4
00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:09.483
<v Speaker 1>so because you can't suffer pointlessly </v>
<v Speaker 1>without becoming bitter and you can't </v>

5
00:00:13.391 --> 00:00:16.690
<v Speaker 1>become bitter without becoming cruel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you need an eight.</v>

6
00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.350
<v Speaker 1>The question is then the question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should David.</v>

7
00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:20.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

8
00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.540
<v Speaker 1>Better aim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

9
00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.800
<v Speaker 1>So then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's your dream?</v>

10
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:39.673
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

11
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.650
<v Speaker 1>Welcome everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Back to the school of greatness podcast.</v>

12
00:00:43.651 --> 00:00:46.380
<v Speaker 1>We've got the legendary Jordan Peterson </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the house.</v>

13
00:00:46.381 --> 00:00:47.400
<v Speaker 1>Good to see us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sir.</v>

14
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.840
<v Speaker 1>Good to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very excited about this.</v>

15
00:00:48.841 --> 00:00:51.330
<v Speaker 1>You've got a book out called 12 rules </v>
<v Speaker 1>for life.</v>

16
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.820
<v Speaker 1>Makes you guys check this out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've probably already got it,</v>

17
00:00:53.821 --> 00:00:54.654
<v Speaker 1>but if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you to go pick it up right </v>

18
00:00:56.011 --> 00:00:57.840
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>An antidote to chaos.</v>

19
00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.393
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've had so much attention over this </v>

20
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.993
<v Speaker 1>last couple of years and I've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>digging into the research and just been </v>

21
00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:06.330
<v Speaker 1>fascinated by everything that you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>been up to.</v>

22
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.720
<v Speaker 1>And I just love your stance on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>vision you have for humanity in terms of</v>

23
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.010
<v Speaker 1>how we can all live better lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think you simplify a lot of things</v>

24
00:01:17.011 --> 00:01:17.844
<v Speaker 1>in this book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which some things people don't like to </v>

25
00:01:20.701 --> 00:01:22.680
<v Speaker 1>simplify.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to complicate.</v>

26
00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:23.653
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's what's gotten you a </v>

27
00:01:25.111 --> 00:01:28.560
<v Speaker 1>lot of attention is that you try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>really simplify a lot of these things.</v>

28
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.860
<v Speaker 1>I try to make everything concrete so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's actually implementable.</v>

29
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.843
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a lot of high level </v>

30
00:01:33.571 --> 00:01:34.404
<v Speaker 1>abstractions in the book because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>ranges up into the theological and </v>

31
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.380
<v Speaker 1>philosophical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's always grounded in what you can</v>

32
00:01:40.381 --> 00:01:41.214
<v Speaker 1>actually do in your life practically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to bridge that gap from the </v>

33
00:01:44.191 --> 00:01:45.024
<v Speaker 1>highest steps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>traction down to the lowest level of </v>

34
00:01:46.351 --> 00:01:48.450
<v Speaker 1>behavior so that it becomes </v>
<v Speaker 1>implementable.</v>

35
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.420
<v Speaker 1>And that's how philosophical concepts </v>
<v Speaker 1>take on their meaning.</v>

36
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:52.740
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause they have to,</v>

37
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.933
<v Speaker 1>they have to have some impact on the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see the world in the way you act in </v>

38
00:01:56.071 --> 00:01:58.000
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or they're not fully realized,</v>

39
00:01:58.001 --> 00:02:00.630
<v Speaker 1>they're not understood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because partly what we mean,</v>

40
00:02:00.631 --> 00:02:03.180
<v Speaker 1>I would say when we say that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand something,</v>

41
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.410
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of a state strange phrase to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand something,</v>

42
00:02:07.411 --> 00:02:12.411
<v Speaker 1>but it means to be able to embody it in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a shift of view and a shift of action.</v>

43
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.120
<v Speaker 1>And then you've got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's graspable,</v>

44
00:02:15.121 --> 00:02:17.850
<v Speaker 1>it's in your hand and body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something in a shift of view,</v>

45
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.810
<v Speaker 1>mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they're the same thing because your</v>

46
00:02:21.811 --> 00:02:22.644
<v Speaker 1>perceptions are very tightly linked to </v>
<v Speaker 1>your actions because of course when </v>

47
00:02:24.631 --> 00:02:25.464
<v Speaker 1>you're acting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're aiming at something you have to </v>

48
00:02:26.611 --> 00:02:29.730
<v Speaker 1>be devoted towards some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

49
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.530
<v Speaker 1>some aim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some target,</v>

50
00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.600
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We play that out in sports all the time.</v>

51
00:02:33.601 --> 00:02:34.434
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why sports are so entertaining </v>

52
00:02:35.311 --> 00:02:37.710
<v Speaker 1>for people is because they dramatize the</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of aim,</v>

53
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.110
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then not only of aim,</v>

54
00:02:40.111 --> 00:02:43.800
<v Speaker 1>but of the pursuit of excellence in </v>
<v Speaker 1>pursuit of that aim.</v>

55
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.843
<v Speaker 1>That's the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason it's a spectacle and the </v>

56
00:02:46.891 --> 00:02:47.724
<v Speaker 1>reason that people participate in it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it dramatizes something </v>

57
00:02:49.921 --> 00:02:50.754
<v Speaker 1>absolutely essential about life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you want to take philosophical </v>

58
00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:56.490
<v Speaker 1>abstractions and you want to use them </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

59
00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.940
<v Speaker 1>to structure your aim and then your </v>
<v Speaker 1>perceptions organize around that aim.</v>

60
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.280
<v Speaker 1>And then you act it out and then you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>got it.</v>

61
00:03:03.281 --> 00:03:04.280
<v Speaker 1>That's then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's,</v>

62
00:03:04.281 --> 00:03:06.730
<v Speaker 1>it's become part of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just an,</v>

63
00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.843
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just a philosophical </v>

64
00:03:08.801 --> 00:03:09.634
<v Speaker 1>abstraction that floats free in space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is there so much conflict in the </v>

65
00:03:13.721 --> 00:03:14.554
<v Speaker 1>world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it because there's so many different </v>

66
00:03:15.491 --> 00:03:18.550
<v Speaker 1>perceptions that people have what they </v>
<v Speaker 1>think should be,</v>

67
00:03:18.551 --> 00:03:19.930
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

68
00:03:19.931 --> 00:03:20.764
<v Speaker 1>part of it is part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course there's conflict because we </v>

69
00:03:22.871 --> 00:03:23.704
<v Speaker 1>have real problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so life is actually difficult </v>

70
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.350
<v Speaker 1>independent of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of psychological foolishness,</v>

71
00:03:29.351 --> 00:03:32.950
<v Speaker 1>let's say independent of the obstacles </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we put in our own path,</v>

72
00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.750
<v Speaker 1>like this judge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's already,</v>

73
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.180
<v Speaker 1>it's already fatally challenging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

74
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:39.400
<v Speaker 1>Life is the ultimate challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We will die.</v>

75
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:40.360
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

76
00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:41.380
<v Speaker 1>there is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

77
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.760
<v Speaker 1>a challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

78
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.440
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fear,</v>

79
00:03:44.441 --> 00:03:45.161
<v Speaker 1>pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those,</v>

80
00:03:45.161 --> 00:03:46.060
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the things,</v>

81
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.953
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that goes along with </v>

82
00:03:47.501 --> 00:03:49.120
<v Speaker 1>suffering is a challenge.</v>

83
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.721
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

84
00:03:49.721 --> 00:03:52.930
<v Speaker 1>it's the full challenge because it takes</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything you have.</v>

85
00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.273
<v Speaker 1>And so part of the reason we disagree is</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there are complex problems to </v>

86
00:03:57.431 --> 00:03:58.264
<v Speaker 1>solve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we also disagree because we're </v>

87
00:03:59.441 --> 00:04:02.710
<v Speaker 1>willfully blind and because we're more </v>
<v Speaker 1>ignorant than we should be.</v>

88
00:04:02.711 --> 00:04:03.544
<v Speaker 1>And we're not everything we should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we tilt towards malevolence from </v>

89
00:04:06.251 --> 00:04:08.800
<v Speaker 1>time to time and we betray each other </v>
<v Speaker 1>and ourselves.</v>

90
00:04:08.801 --> 00:04:12.280
<v Speaker 1>And so we take a bad lot in many ways </v>
<v Speaker 1>and make it worse now.</v>

91
00:04:12.281 --> 00:04:14.380
<v Speaker 1>Not always obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we don't have to,</v>

92
00:04:14.381 --> 00:04:17.110
<v Speaker 1>but that's sort of the baseline that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're working against.</v>

93
00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.083
<v Speaker 1>And I think people are most disappointed</v>
<v Speaker 1>in life when they're disappointed in </v>

94
00:04:21.821 --> 00:04:22.990
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

95
00:04:22.991 --> 00:04:25.510
<v Speaker 1>they see that they've made things worse </v>
<v Speaker 1>than they had to be,</v>

96
00:04:25.511 --> 00:04:28.450
<v Speaker 1>even though the baseline can be pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>brutal.</v>

97
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.943
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the book and all my lectures I </v>

98
00:04:32.351 --> 00:04:34.060
<v Speaker 1>suppose are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

99
00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:35.163
<v Speaker 1>are put forward in an attempt to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>the high level philosophical </v>

100
00:04:37.961 --> 00:04:38.794
<v Speaker 1>obstructions and to make them into </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's actionable and to take </v>

101
00:04:41.681 --> 00:04:42.514
<v Speaker 1>the next best action in your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>improve your life so we don't have to </v>

102
00:04:45.191 --> 00:04:46.630
<v Speaker 1>suffer as much while.</v>

103
00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.480
<v Speaker 1>And hopefully also so that people around</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to either.</v>

104
00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.883
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things I've been talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>to my audiences about is the </v>

105
00:04:53.681 --> 00:04:55.960
<v Speaker 1>relationship between responsibility and </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning,</v>

106
00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.000
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you say?</v>

107
00:04:58.001 --> 00:05:00.370
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a constant refrain in the book.</v>

108
00:05:00.371 --> 00:05:02.520
<v Speaker 1>It's one of its underlying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

109
00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.023
<v Speaker 1>messages let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or themes is a better way of thinking </v>

110
00:05:07.001 --> 00:05:08.210
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

111
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.933
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you start with the presumption that </v>

112
00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:17.610
<v Speaker 1>there's a baseline of suffering in life </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that that can be exaggerated by as a</v>

113
00:05:17.801 --> 00:05:18.634
<v Speaker 1>consequence of human failing as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of malevolence and betrayal </v>

114
00:05:21.251 --> 00:05:22.084
<v Speaker 1>and self betrayal in dc to know all </v>
<v Speaker 1>those things that we do to each other </v>

115
00:05:25.121 --> 00:05:26.770
<v Speaker 1>and to ourselves that we know that </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't good,</v>

116
00:05:26.771 --> 00:05:27.604
<v Speaker 1>that amplifies the suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's sort of the baseline against </v>

117
00:05:29.921 --> 00:05:31.450
<v Speaker 1>which you have to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

118
00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:32.383
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's contemplation of that often </v>

119
00:05:34.591 --> 00:05:35.424
<v Speaker 1>that makes people hopeless and depressed</v>
<v Speaker 1>and anxious and overwhelmed and all of </v>

120
00:05:38.201 --> 00:05:38.410
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

121
00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:39.060
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

122
00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.510
<v Speaker 1>and they have the reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you need something to put up against</v>

123
00:05:43.511 --> 00:05:44.344
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what you put up against that is </v>

124
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:47.223
<v Speaker 1>meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning is actually the instinct that </v>

125
00:05:48.671 --> 00:05:51.340
<v Speaker 1>helps you guide yourself through that </v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe.</v>

126
00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.410
<v Speaker 1>And most of that meaning is to be found </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the adoption of responsibility.</v>

127
00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.340
<v Speaker 1>So if you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

128
00:05:58.341 --> 00:05:59.174
<v Speaker 1>if you think about the people that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>admire while you think about when you </v>

129
00:06:01.461 --> 00:06:04.610
<v Speaker 1>have a clear conscience first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause that's a good thing to aim at,</v>

130
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:06.380
<v Speaker 1>which is something different than </v>
<v Speaker 1>happiness,</v>

131
00:06:06.381 --> 00:06:07.730
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

132
00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.650
<v Speaker 1>a clear conscience is different than </v>
<v Speaker 1>happiness.</v>

133
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.513
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's better.</v>

134
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:12.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's better guilting yourself.</v>

135
00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.780
<v Speaker 1>You're not feeling bad about your Isas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

136
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.930
<v Speaker 1>You feel that you've justifying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've justified your existence,</v>

137
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:18.793
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you're not waking up at three in </v>

138
00:06:19.881 --> 00:06:20.714
<v Speaker 1>the morning in a cold sweat thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about all the terrible things that </v>

139
00:06:22.431 --> 00:06:23.264
<v Speaker 1>you've involved yourself in what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>said to someone that you shouldn't have </v>

140
00:06:25.521 --> 00:06:26.270
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or my,</v>

141
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:29.210
<v Speaker 1>you acted or lie the opportunity you </v>
<v Speaker 1>lost or,</v>

142
00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:29.991
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

143
00:06:29.991 --> 00:06:30.770
<v Speaker 1>or yeah.</v>

144
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:32.780
<v Speaker 1>Or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the things that you've,</v>

145
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.260
<v Speaker 1>that you've let go that you should have </v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalized on and all of that.</v>

146
00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:41.060
<v Speaker 1>And so if you think about the times when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're at peace with yourself,</v>

147
00:06:41.061 --> 00:06:43.640
<v Speaker 1>with regards to how you're conducting </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself in the world,</v>

148
00:06:43.641 --> 00:06:47.270
<v Speaker 1>it's almost always conditions under </v>
<v Speaker 1>which you've adopted responsibility,</v>

149
00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:49.310
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least the most,</v>

150
00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:54.430
<v Speaker 1>the most guilt I think that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience perhaps is the sure knowledge</v>

151
00:06:54.861 --> 00:06:55.694
<v Speaker 1>that you're not even taking care of </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself so that you're leaving that </v>

152
00:06:58.101 --> 00:07:00.800
<v Speaker 1>responsibility to other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause that's pretty pathetic.</v>

153
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:03.500
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you're psychopathic and you know,</v>

154
00:07:03.501 --> 00:07:05.700
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're living a parasitical life and</v>

155
00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:06.603
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that as a very small minority of people </v>

156
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:11.150
<v Speaker 1>and an even smaller minority think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's justifiable.</v>

157
00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.930
<v Speaker 1>But most of the time you're in guilt and</v>
<v Speaker 1>shame because you're not,</v>

158
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:16.663
<v Speaker 1>you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only are you not taking care of </v>

159
00:07:18.831 --> 00:07:19.611
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

160
00:07:19.611 --> 00:07:20.444
<v Speaker 1>so someone else has to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're not living up to your full </v>

161
00:07:23.241 --> 00:07:24.050
<v Speaker 1>potential.</v>

162
00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:26.960
<v Speaker 1>And so there's an existential weight </v>
<v Speaker 1>that goes along with that.</v>

163
00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.880
<v Speaker 1>So as you suffer even more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you don't take care of yourself and</v>

164
00:07:30.881 --> 00:07:34.700
<v Speaker 1>take the best actions or do the work </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you know you can do,</v>

165
00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:38.360
<v Speaker 1>and you rely on someone else to support </v>
<v Speaker 1>you financially,</v>

166
00:07:38.361 --> 00:07:39.560
<v Speaker 1>emotionally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>physically,</v>

167
00:07:39.561 --> 00:07:40.520
<v Speaker 1>whatever you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>home,</v>

168
00:07:40.521 --> 00:07:41.440
<v Speaker 1>whatever it may be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

169
00:07:41.441 --> 00:07:42.590
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause you're not only,</v>

170
00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.110
<v Speaker 1>you're not only not being what you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

171
00:07:45.111 --> 00:07:47.870
<v Speaker 1>you're interfering with someone else </v>
<v Speaker 1>being what they could be.</v>

172
00:07:47.871 --> 00:07:48.561
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're,</v>

173
00:07:48.561 --> 00:07:50.390
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not only a void,</v>

174
00:07:50.391 --> 00:07:53.300
<v Speaker 1>you're a drain Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a catastrophe.</v>

175
00:07:53.301 --> 00:07:56.870
<v Speaker 1>And we usually don't even know when </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're in that situation cause we're in a</v>

176
00:07:56.871 --> 00:07:59.540
<v Speaker 1>depressed state or where or we don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to see it.</v>

177
00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:00.673
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wake up at three in the morning and </v>

178
00:08:01.461 --> 00:08:03.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

179
00:08:03.171 --> 00:08:04.004
<v Speaker 1>and then you think of the people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you admire yourself or perhaps you can </v>

180
00:08:07.041 --> 00:08:10.310
<v Speaker 1>at least live with yourself when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking responsibility,</v>

181
00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:11.930
<v Speaker 1>at least for yourself.</v>

182
00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.393
<v Speaker 1>And so that settles your conscience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then if you look at the people that </v>

183
00:08:16.071 --> 00:08:20.720
<v Speaker 1>you spontaneously admire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the act of spontaneously admiring</v>

184
00:08:20.721 --> 00:08:24.140
<v Speaker 1>someone is the manifestation of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>instinct for meaning.</v>

185
00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:24.980
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

186
00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:25.813
<v Speaker 1>and this is partly why people are so </v>
<v Speaker 1>enamored of sports figures because the </v>

187
00:08:29.121 --> 00:08:29.954
<v Speaker 1>sports figures are playing out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The drama of attaining the goal of </v>

188
00:08:32.871 --> 00:08:35.000
<v Speaker 1>attaining a certain kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

189
00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:38.000
<v Speaker 1>psychological and physical perfection in</v>
<v Speaker 1>pursuit of the goal.</v>

190
00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:38.983
<v Speaker 1>That's the drama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to spontaneously admire that is to </v>

191
00:08:41.631 --> 00:08:42.464
<v Speaker 1>have that instinct for meaning latch on </v>
<v Speaker 1>to something that can be used as a </v>

192
00:08:45.051 --> 00:08:45.884
<v Speaker 1>model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that model should be </v>

193
00:08:46.971 --> 00:08:49.460
<v Speaker 1>transcribed into something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>applicable in life.</v>

194
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:50.623
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you really like to see in an </v>

195
00:08:51.651 --> 00:08:52.484
<v Speaker 1>athletic performance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really like to see someone who's </v>

196
00:08:54.021 --> 00:08:55.870
<v Speaker 1>extremely disciplined and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

197
00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:59.730
<v Speaker 1>and in shape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do something physically remarkable but,</v>

198
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:00.773
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to stretch themselves even beyond </v>

199
00:09:02.221 --> 00:09:03.054
<v Speaker 1>their previous exploits because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>really like to see a brilliant move in </v>

200
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:06.780
<v Speaker 1>an athletic match.</v>

201
00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:07.883
<v Speaker 1>But you also like to see that person </v>
<v Speaker 1>ensconced in a broader moral framework </v>

202
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:12.773
<v Speaker 1>so that not only are they trying to win </v>
<v Speaker 1>and disciplining themselves in pursuit </v>

203
00:09:17.431 --> 00:09:18.264
<v Speaker 1>of that victory and then stretching </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves so they're continually </v>

204
00:09:20.341 --> 00:09:23.190
<v Speaker 1>getting better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're doing it in a way that helps</v>

205
00:09:23.191 --> 00:09:24.024
<v Speaker 1>develop their whole team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's good for the sport in </v>

206
00:09:25.621 --> 00:09:26.454
<v Speaker 1>general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that reflects well on the broader </v>

207
00:09:27.691 --> 00:09:29.610
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a great leader and their team.</v>

208
00:09:29.611 --> 00:09:30.444
<v Speaker 1>They're positive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're good sportsmen and against the </v>

209
00:09:32.701 --> 00:09:35.040
<v Speaker 1>competitors and not negative towards the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people.</v>

210
00:09:35.041 --> 00:09:37.620
<v Speaker 1>They're lifting them up to like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimate.</v>

211
00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:39.300
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

212
00:09:39.301 --> 00:09:40.134
<v Speaker 1>So that they can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can work for their own improvement </v>

213
00:09:41.461 --> 00:09:42.294
<v Speaker 1>in a way that simultaneously works for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the improvement of their team and that </v>

214
00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:46.650
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and for the sport and while,</v>

215
00:09:46.651 --> 00:09:47.484
<v Speaker 1>and then to the degree that that spills </v>
<v Speaker 1>over into the broader culture so much </v>

216
00:09:49.831 --> 00:09:50.660
<v Speaker 1>the better.</v>

217
00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:54.690
<v Speaker 1>So that's all being dramatized in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in an athletic event.</v>

218
00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:57.360
<v Speaker 1>And it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not philosophical,</v>

219
00:09:57.361 --> 00:09:58.370
<v Speaker 1>it's concrete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

220
00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:01.590
<v Speaker 1>It's dramatized in the world and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what the game's represent.</v>

221
00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:03.240
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

222
00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:06.780
<v Speaker 1>and it's partly because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well in some sense life is a game.</v>

223
00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:09.810
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in that you're always,</v>

224
00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:13.260
<v Speaker 1>the analogy is that in in life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in sports,</v>

225
00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:14.850
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

226
00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:15.893
<v Speaker 1>you're setting forth the name and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>arranging your perceptions and your </v>

227
00:10:20.251 --> 00:10:23.220
<v Speaker 1>actions in pursuit of that and that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>also,</v>

228
00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:24.063
<v Speaker 1>we generally do it well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cooperating and competing with other </v>

229
00:10:25.801 --> 00:10:26.634
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's also the game like element as </v>

230
00:10:28.261 --> 00:10:30.540
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of that's dramatized in athletics.</v>

231
00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:33.600
<v Speaker 1>That's like philosophy for people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't philosophical.</v>

232
00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:35.640
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not being smart about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>tonight.</v>

233
00:10:35.641 --> 00:10:36.474
<v Speaker 1>It's like it really is philosophy for </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who aren't being philosophical </v>

234
00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:41.130
<v Speaker 1>cause it's played out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

235
00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:42.630
<v Speaker 1>and you can see it too.</v>

236
00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:47.220
<v Speaker 1>You can see the spontaneous appreciation</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the human spirit manifest itself.</v>

237
00:10:47.221 --> 00:10:51.090
<v Speaker 1>When you see people rise to their feet </v>
<v Speaker 1>spontaneously in a sports arena,</v>

238
00:10:51.091 --> 00:10:53.700
<v Speaker 1>when they see someone do something </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly remarkable,</v>

239
00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:54.773
<v Speaker 1>see an athlete who's extremely trained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stretch themselves beyond what you'd </v>

240
00:10:58.441 --> 00:10:59.274
<v Speaker 1>think is a normative human limit and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone celebrates that like </v>

241
00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:05.430
<v Speaker 1>spontaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's quite something to behold.</v>

242
00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:06.493
<v Speaker 1>And so talking back to responsibility </v>
<v Speaker 1>and meaning when we're watching sports </v>

243
00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:10.463
<v Speaker 1>or someone to do this act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does this do for us with in terms </v>

244
00:11:13.201 --> 00:11:14.940
<v Speaker 1>of responsibility and meaning?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

245
00:11:14.941 --> 00:11:15.330
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

246
00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:16.163
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it helps us figure out what we can </v>

247
00:11:18.271 --> 00:11:20.070
<v Speaker 1>imitate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gives us a model.</v>

248
00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.193
<v Speaker 1>It's a model as a model of something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I respect while even what </v>

249
00:11:24.241 --> 00:11:28.980
<v Speaker 1>philosophy is or even theology for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter is an abstract model.</v>

250
00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:31.870
<v Speaker 1>Like it's laid out in words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the problem often is,</v>

251
00:11:31.871 --> 00:11:32.704
<v Speaker 1>is it becomes so abstract that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know how to bring it back down to </v>

252
00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:35.850
<v Speaker 1>total embodiment.</v>

253
00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.040
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas something like,</v>

254
00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:42.630
<v Speaker 1>like the drama of a sports event is sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of midway between philosophy and action,</v>

255
00:11:42.631 --> 00:11:43.500
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so it's,</v>

256
00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:47.310
<v Speaker 1>it's not entirely abstracted because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not only coded in words,</v>

257
00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:48.353
<v Speaker 1>it's acted out visual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see an example of what just </v>

258
00:11:50.581 --> 00:11:53.650
<v Speaker 1>happened and you can try to reverse </v>
<v Speaker 1>engineer how they feel that,</v>

259
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:55.060
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

260
00:11:55.061 --> 00:11:56.170
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least you,</v>

261
00:11:56.380 --> 00:12:00.400
<v Speaker 1>the fact that you admire the person </v>
<v Speaker 1>means that you might start to try to act</v>

262
00:12:00.401 --> 00:12:01.234
<v Speaker 1>like family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's not easy and maybe that would </v>

263
00:12:02.951 --> 00:12:03.784
<v Speaker 1>mean maybe that would mean that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>start to discipline yourself with </v>

264
00:12:05.741 --> 00:12:06.574
<v Speaker 1>regards to a particular sport,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it might also be that you start to </v>

265
00:12:09.011 --> 00:12:12.010
<v Speaker 1>mimic or at least affected in some way </v>
<v Speaker 1>by their,</v>

266
00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:15.360
<v Speaker 1>their sportsman sportsman like behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

267
00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:17.980
<v Speaker 1>Which is the ground of a certain kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>ethic.</v>

268
00:12:17.981 --> 00:12:20.140
<v Speaker 1>Because if you can play well with </v>
<v Speaker 1>others,</v>

269
00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:22.540
<v Speaker 1>which is sort of the hallmark of a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>sport,</v>

270
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:23.703
<v Speaker 1>then that actually means that you're a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonably sophisticated and civilized </v>

271
00:12:26.531 --> 00:12:27.040
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

272
00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:29.950
<v Speaker 1>It's really important to learn to play </v>
<v Speaker 1>well with others.</v>

273
00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:30.933
<v Speaker 1>There isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the ground of ethics and you can </v>

274
00:12:32.411 --> 00:12:35.410
<v Speaker 1>do it there and that's setting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then hopefully you can translate it into</v>

275
00:12:35.411 --> 00:12:36.190
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

276
00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:37.360
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly right.</v>

277
00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:39.220
<v Speaker 1>That's my goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you hope for,</v>

278
00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:39.611
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

279
00:12:39.611 --> 00:12:41.860
<v Speaker 1>That's the goal of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if the,</v>

280
00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:46.180
<v Speaker 1>if the goal of the game is to put the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ball through the ball into the net,</v>

281
00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:47.433
<v Speaker 1>then the goal of having games is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>produce people who can take proper aim </v>

282
00:12:50.801 --> 00:12:52.600
<v Speaker 1>no matter where they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

283
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:54.610
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what we're trying to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

284
00:12:54.611 --> 00:12:55.211
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

285
00:12:55.211 --> 00:12:56.950
<v Speaker 1>with athletics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

286
00:12:56.951 --> 00:12:57.970
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

287
00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.430
<v Speaker 1>so I've been talking to my audiences a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot about that,</v>

288
00:13:00.431 --> 00:13:01.264
<v Speaker 1>about Andy Weil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's more to it too because if </v>

289
00:13:05.051 --> 00:13:07.420
<v Speaker 1>the background of life has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there's a,</v>

290
00:13:07.421 --> 00:13:08.254
<v Speaker 1>there's an ineradicable component of </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering and that's complicated by </v>

291
00:13:11.441 --> 00:13:12.274
<v Speaker 1>let's say malevolence and the proclivity</v>
<v Speaker 1>of people to be trade themselves and </v>

292
00:13:14.831 --> 00:13:15.490
<v Speaker 1>others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

293
00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:19.480
<v Speaker 1>which complicates it makes it worse then</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

294
00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:22.780
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have a noble aim and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

295
00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:26.380
<v Speaker 1>and if that isn't imbuing your life with</v>
<v Speaker 1>sustainable meaning,</v>

296
00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:29.110
<v Speaker 1>then you fall prey to all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe,</v>

297
00:13:29.111 --> 00:13:33.100
<v Speaker 1>the pain and the anxiety and the anger </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's suffering generates.</v>

298
00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:33.933
<v Speaker 1>And that makes you bitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because what I'm hearing you say is </v>

299
00:13:35.981 --> 00:13:39.310
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and correct me if I'm wrong,</v>

300
00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:44.050
<v Speaker 1>we must have an aim in our life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter what stage of life we're in.</v>

301
00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:44.943
<v Speaker 1>And if we don't have some type of aim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if for a few months of an aim of </v>

302
00:13:47.891 --> 00:13:49.420
<v Speaker 1>going somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>direction,</v>

303
00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:50.883
<v Speaker 1>we're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering is going to be even more </v>

304
00:13:52.121 --> 00:13:53.610
<v Speaker 1>suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pointless,</v>

305
00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:56.430
<v Speaker 1>because we're already going to face the </v>
<v Speaker 1>greatest challenges,</v>

306
00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:58.720
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're stuck with 30 struggling.</v>

307
00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:01.120
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way of diversity is coming no</v>

308
00:14:01.121 --> 00:14:01.980
<v Speaker 1>matter what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

309
00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:05.350
<v Speaker 1>We have big goals or small little goal </v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever it may be,</v>

310
00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:09.970
<v Speaker 1>but it's going to be the less suffering </v>
<v Speaker 1>if we have an aim.</v>

311
00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:12.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well not only that,</v>

312
00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:15.730
<v Speaker 1>it's worse than that even because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering is zero,</v>

313
00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:16.541
<v Speaker 1>meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

314
00:14:16.541 --> 00:14:19.810
<v Speaker 1>the suffering is pain and the suffering </v>
<v Speaker 1>is anxiety and uncertainty,</v>

315
00:14:19.811 --> 00:14:21.160
<v Speaker 1>and the suffering is hopelessness.</v>

316
00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.650
<v Speaker 1>But the consequences of all that is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get bitter.</v>

317
00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:25.023
<v Speaker 1>And when you get bitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get mean and you get cruel and you </v>

318
00:14:26.951 --> 00:14:29.680
<v Speaker 1>start to hurt yourself and other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not only that,</v>

319
00:14:29.681 --> 00:14:31.720
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have a goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you suffer.</v>

320
00:14:31.721 --> 00:14:33.700
<v Speaker 1>It's that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have a goal,</v>

321
00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:34.683
<v Speaker 1>you suffer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you get cruel and bitter and </v>

322
00:14:36.491 --> 00:14:37.324
<v Speaker 1>resentful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you start to actively try to </v>

323
00:14:38.681 --> 00:14:41.020
<v Speaker 1>make the world a worse place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

324
00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:41.883
<v Speaker 1>so because you can't suffer pointlessly </v>
<v Speaker 1>without becoming bitter and you can't </v>

325
00:14:45.821 --> 00:14:49.080
<v Speaker 1>become bitter without becoming cruel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you need an ame.</v>

326
00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:51.770
<v Speaker 1>And the question is then the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course you should aim.</v>

327
00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:53.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

328
00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:55.010
<v Speaker 1>Better aim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

329
00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.580
<v Speaker 1>So then the question is what should you </v>
<v Speaker 1>name be?</v>

330
00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:58.863
<v Speaker 1>And we have a program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the things I wanted to talk </v>

331
00:15:00.921 --> 00:15:01.580
<v Speaker 1>to you about today.</v>

332
00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:02.413
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have this website called self </v>

333
00:15:03.621 --> 00:15:08.060
<v Speaker 1>authoring.com and that program helps </v>
<v Speaker 1>people write about their life.</v>

334
00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:11.060
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a past authoring program </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

335
00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:12.350
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to establish your aim.</v>

336
00:15:12.351 --> 00:15:13.184
<v Speaker 1>You have to know where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're trying to orient </v>

337
00:15:15.711 --> 00:15:16.544
<v Speaker 1>yourself on a map.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't Orient Yourself on a map </v>

338
00:15:18.291 --> 00:15:19.124
<v Speaker 1>unless you know where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll also have to know where you're </v>

339
00:15:20.481 --> 00:15:21.081
<v Speaker 1>going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

340
00:15:21.081 --> 00:15:23.660
<v Speaker 1>So those are the two relevant things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The past,</v>

341
00:15:23.661 --> 00:15:26.650
<v Speaker 1>our three program helps people write </v>
<v Speaker 1>about their lives.</v>

342
00:15:26.651 --> 00:15:27.484
<v Speaker 1>So it's a guided autobiography.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We asked people to break their life up </v>

343
00:15:30.051 --> 00:15:34.130
<v Speaker 1>into six epochs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six sections and then to write about the</v>

344
00:15:34.131 --> 00:15:39.131
<v Speaker 1>emotionally important events in those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in those epochs and to detail out why,</v>

345
00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:44.270
<v Speaker 1>why the positive things happen and why </v>
<v Speaker 1>more of that could conceivably happen in</v>

346
00:15:44.271 --> 00:15:45.104
<v Speaker 1>the future and to detail out why the </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative things happened in to try to </v>

347
00:15:47.361 --> 00:15:51.380
<v Speaker 1>understand why with a name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to not replicating them in the future.</v>

348
00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:54.710
<v Speaker 1>Because the purpose of memory isn't to </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember the past.</v>

349
00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:55.963
<v Speaker 1>The purpose of memory is so that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you figure out what went wrong when </v>

350
00:15:59.481 --> 00:16:02.450
<v Speaker 1>something went wrong so you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>duplicate it in the future.</v>

351
00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:03.303
<v Speaker 1>So that's the purpose of memory and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>past authoring program can help people </v>

352
00:16:06.291 --> 00:16:07.124
<v Speaker 1>catch up and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to catch up if you have </v>

353
00:16:09.441 --> 00:16:10.274
<v Speaker 1>memories that are older than about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>year and a half that still cause you </v>

354
00:16:13.161 --> 00:16:16.160
<v Speaker 1>emotional pain when you think about them</v>
<v Speaker 1>or if you dwell on them,</v>

355
00:16:16.161 --> 00:16:18.890
<v Speaker 1>they come spontaneously back to mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means you haven't,</v>

356
00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:22.460
<v Speaker 1>it means that there's part of your life </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you haven't mapped out properly and</v>

357
00:16:22.461 --> 00:16:24.560
<v Speaker 1>it still has emotional valence that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>gripping.</v>

358
00:16:24.561 --> 00:16:27.790
<v Speaker 1>You should that story or it's still </v>
<v Speaker 1>holding on to you,</v>

359
00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:29.153
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go,</v>

360
00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:29.901
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

361
00:16:29.901 --> 00:16:32.090
<v Speaker 1>Well you haven't been able to navigate </v>
<v Speaker 1>your way through it.</v>

362
00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:33.133
<v Speaker 1>There's a pitfall there that you fell in</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you don't know how to avoid similar </v>

363
00:16:36.531 --> 00:16:37.364
<v Speaker 1>pitfalls in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's why your brain won't let it </v>

364
00:16:39.741 --> 00:16:40.574
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

365
00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:42.680
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's saying that's what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety systems do.</v>

366
00:16:42.681 --> 00:16:44.360
<v Speaker 1>It's like this happened to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't good.</v>

367
00:16:44.361 --> 00:16:45.410
<v Speaker 1>This happened to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't good.</v>

368
00:16:45.411 --> 00:16:46.550
<v Speaker 1>This happened to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't good.</v>

369
00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:47.520
<v Speaker 1>Fix It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fix it,</v>

370
00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:48.440
<v Speaker 1>fix it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fix it.</v>

371
00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:50.600
<v Speaker 1>That will never go away unless you fix </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

372
00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:51.650
<v Speaker 1>How do you fix it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

373
00:16:51.651 --> 00:16:53.900
<v Speaker 1>you have to figure out why it happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

374
00:16:53.901 --> 00:16:55.580
<v Speaker 1>That's the first thing is like how did </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

375
00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:59.360
<v Speaker 1>how was it that that situation arose to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pull you down?</v>

376
00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:01.160
<v Speaker 1>And that's not simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why.</v>

377
00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:02.113
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why we have the writing program </v>

378
00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:04.520
<v Speaker 1>because it's complicated to think </v>
<v Speaker 1>through,</v>

379
00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:07.400
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you face it and you,</v>

380
00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:10.260
<v Speaker 1>and you meditate on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say and say,</v>

381
00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:11.103
<v Speaker 1>and you do this voluntarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a pretty high probability that </v>

382
00:17:13.311 --> 00:17:16.820
<v Speaker 1>you'll be able to decrease the </v>
<v Speaker 1>probability that will be repeated in the</v>

383
00:17:16.821 --> 00:17:18.110
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

384
00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:20.110
<v Speaker 1>go ahead.</v>

385
00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:21.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh well,</v>

386
00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:22.213
<v Speaker 1>well we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the second part of the program </v>

387
00:17:24.021 --> 00:17:26.960
<v Speaker 1>helps people do an analysis of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>virtues and their faults.</v>

388
00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:27.893
<v Speaker 1>Same sort of idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's good about you that you could </v>

389
00:17:29.601 --> 00:17:33.770
<v Speaker 1>capitalize on what's weak about you that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to fix so that it doesn't bring</v>

390
00:17:33.771 --> 00:17:34.970
<v Speaker 1>you down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

391
00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:35.833
<v Speaker 1>And that's the present or three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the future authoring program is </v>

392
00:17:37.791 --> 00:17:38.624
<v Speaker 1>probably most relevant to you and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>listeners because you're interested in </v>

393
00:17:41.721 --> 00:17:42.554
<v Speaker 1>helping people establish aims.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we already talked about the fact </v>

394
00:17:45.981 --> 00:17:49.260
<v Speaker 1>that you need an aim in life or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or that's where you derive your meaning.</v>

395
00:17:49.261 --> 00:17:51.420
<v Speaker 1>And without that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things go to hell.</v>

396
00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:54.270
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as literally as that can be taken.</v>

397
00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:58.020
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not easy to ask people to say,</v>

398
00:17:58.470 --> 00:17:59.303
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's easy to ask them what do you want </v>

399
00:18:00.971 --> 00:18:01.804
<v Speaker 1>in your life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very hard question to answer </v>

400
00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:05.940
<v Speaker 1>cause it's too vague and grantee.</v>

401
00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:08.400
<v Speaker 1>So we help in the future authoring </v>
<v Speaker 1>program,</v>

402
00:18:08.401 --> 00:18:10.080
<v Speaker 1>we help people break that down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

403
00:18:10.081 --> 00:18:10.830
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so here's,</v>

404
00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:11.663
<v Speaker 1>here's the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you put yourself in the right frame </v>

405
00:18:13.771 --> 00:18:15.780
<v Speaker 1>of mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's the right frame of mind?</v>

406
00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:17.340
<v Speaker 1>It's like rural too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this book,</v>

407
00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:22.100
<v Speaker 1>treat yourself like you're someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsible for helping your,</v>

408
00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:24.210
<v Speaker 1>someone that you are responsible for </v>
<v Speaker 1>helping.</v>

409
00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:28.470
<v Speaker 1>So what that means is you have to start </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the presupposition that despite all</v>

410
00:18:28.471 --> 00:18:31.920
<v Speaker 1>your flaws and insufficiencies that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>worth having you around.</v>

411
00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:34.290
<v Speaker 1>And that it would be okay if things were</v>
<v Speaker 1>better for you.</v>

412
00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:35.363
<v Speaker 1>So you need to take care of yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're taking care of someone you </v>

413
00:18:37.261 --> 00:18:38.094
<v Speaker 1>care for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a bit of a detachment in </v>

414
00:18:39.811 --> 00:18:41.760
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the next thing is,</v>

415
00:18:41.761 --> 00:18:43.830
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now look three to five years down the</v>

416
00:18:43.831 --> 00:18:44.311
<v Speaker 1>road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

417
00:18:44.311 --> 00:18:45.144
<v Speaker 1>You get to have what you need and want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assuming you're being reasonable and </v>

418
00:18:47.671 --> 00:18:48.504
<v Speaker 1>that you actually want it to means </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're willing to make the sacrifices </v>

419
00:18:51.061 --> 00:18:52.920
<v Speaker 1>that would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would make it possible.</v>

420
00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:54.630
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean by reasonable?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

421
00:18:54.631 --> 00:18:56.010
<v Speaker 1>that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the next thing.</v>

422
00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.630
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>within your grasp,</v>

423
00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:01.320
<v Speaker 1>that would be something is out of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>grasp,</v>

424
00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:06.470
<v Speaker 1>but you still push hard enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you need an incremental plant,</v>

425
00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:07.873
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to break that goal down into </v>

426
00:19:09.211 --> 00:19:11.070
<v Speaker 1>steps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Phrase goal within a year.</v>

427
00:19:11.071 --> 00:19:11.940
<v Speaker 1>That's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

428
00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:13.740
<v Speaker 1>I haven't even done the work to mass </v>
<v Speaker 1>riskily yet.</v>

429
00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:14.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got it.</v>

430
00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:15.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's it.</v>

431
00:19:15.001 --> 00:19:18.420
<v Speaker 1>And you can have a high end goal and </v>
<v Speaker 1>more power to you if you do need it.</v>

432
00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:20.070
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need a pathway to it.</v>

433
00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:24.540
<v Speaker 1>If it's 10 stories up above you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need a staircase to get there.</v>

434
00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:25.403
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you have to build the staircase </v>

435
00:19:26.401 --> 00:19:29.430
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so in the future authoring program,</v>

436
00:19:29.431 --> 00:19:30.540
<v Speaker 1>so you're asked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

437
00:19:30.541 --> 00:19:31.170
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's,</v>

438
00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:34.530
<v Speaker 1>you get to have what you want and need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the proposition,</v>

439
00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:35.940
<v Speaker 1>but you have to imagine it.</v>

440
00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:37.200
<v Speaker 1>You have to define it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>name at it.</v>

441
00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:38.880
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then the first thing is,</v>

442
00:19:38.881 --> 00:19:39.714
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

443
00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:43.260
<v Speaker 1>if you could put your family together </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way you wanted it to be,</v>

444
00:19:43.261 --> 00:19:44.094
<v Speaker 1>what would that look like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that might be your siblings and </v>

445
00:19:45.961 --> 00:19:48.000
<v Speaker 1>your parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that also might be,</v>

446
00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:50.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your wife or your husband and your kids,</v>

447
00:19:50.071 --> 00:19:50.904
<v Speaker 1>assuming that you're at that point in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your life could have the family you </v>

448
00:19:53.161 --> 00:19:55.110
<v Speaker 1>wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would that look like?</v>

449
00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:56.393
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

450
00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:58.170
<v Speaker 1>Career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>

451
00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:03.320
<v Speaker 1>You get to have the career or the job </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that is within your grasp necessary</v>

452
00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:05.820
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and suitable for you.</v>

453
00:20:05.821 --> 00:20:08.370
<v Speaker 1>If you were taking care of yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are you going to educate yourself?</v>

454
00:20:08.371 --> 00:20:09.840
<v Speaker 1>Because you're not as smart as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be.</v>

455
00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:11.610
<v Speaker 1>There's lot more things you need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

456
00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:14.130
<v Speaker 1>So you gotta keep learning and moving </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward.</v>

457
00:20:14.131 --> 00:20:15.120
<v Speaker 1>So you need to plan for that.</v>

458
00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:17.940
<v Speaker 1>How are you going to take care of </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself mentally and physically?</v>

459
00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:19.193
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

460
00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:21.810
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are you going to avoid that?</v>

461
00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:24.330
<v Speaker 1>The catastrophic temptations for </v>
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>

462
00:20:24.331 --> 00:20:25.164
<v Speaker 1>of drugs and alcohol because that pulls </v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people doubt and you need a </v>

463
00:20:27.001 --> 00:20:28.830
<v Speaker 1>plan for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be a social drinker.</v>

464
00:20:28.831 --> 00:20:30.750
<v Speaker 1>How much are you going to drink?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much is too much?</v>

465
00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:31.703
<v Speaker 1>What about your drug use?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got to regulate that so it isn't a </v>

466
00:20:33.631 --> 00:20:34.464
<v Speaker 1>pitfall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are you going to use your time </v>

467
00:20:35.821 --> 00:20:39.180
<v Speaker 1>meaningful and productively outside of </v>
<v Speaker 1>work is needed to plan for that.</v>

468
00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:40.523
<v Speaker 1>So that's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's one other that that's a fixed </v>

469
00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:44.070
<v Speaker 1>mindset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

470
00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:44.903
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there are seven initial </v>

471
00:20:45.481 --> 00:20:47.530
<v Speaker 1>questions and I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember the one,</v>

472
00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:48.850
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

473
00:20:48.851 --> 00:20:51.400
<v Speaker 1>intimate relationship of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have,</v>

474
00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:53.980
<v Speaker 1>do you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you want to longterm stable,</v>

475
00:20:53.981 --> 00:20:54.814
<v Speaker 1>intimate relationship and if you do then</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would you like that to lay itself </v>

476
00:20:57.911 --> 00:20:58.350
<v Speaker 1>out?</v>

477
00:20:58.350 --> 00:21:01.300
<v Speaker 1>You got to have vision for that because </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have a vision,</v>

478
00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:03.550
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to aim at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't aim at it,</v>

479
00:21:03.551 --> 00:21:06.010
<v Speaker 1>then you won't even see the </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunities when they arise.</v>

480
00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:09.010
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing that's so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote about this in chapter 10,</v>

481
00:21:09.011 --> 00:21:09.844
<v Speaker 1>which is be precise in your speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a chapter about the fact that ame </v>

482
00:21:14.291 --> 00:21:16.660
<v Speaker 1>structure your perceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

483
00:21:16.661 --> 00:21:19.210
<v Speaker 1>once you aim at something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain,</v>

484
00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:20.103
<v Speaker 1>literally that perceptual structures in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain and your visual cortex </v>

485
00:21:22.721 --> 00:21:23.554
<v Speaker 1>reorient themselves to calculate a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathway to the ame and then what they </v>

486
00:21:26.891 --> 00:21:30.000
<v Speaker 1>show you in the world is obstacles to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that path and,</v>

487
00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:31.133
<v Speaker 1>and open pathways to the path.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's actually how the world reveals </v>

488
00:21:33.461 --> 00:21:34.360
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like,</v>

489
00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:39.810
<v Speaker 1>just like when you're driving in a car </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you have a map and you or you aim at</v>

490
00:21:39.881 --> 00:21:40.714
<v Speaker 1>a particular place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then all the things that are related to </v>

491
00:21:42.641 --> 00:21:43.474
<v Speaker 1>that place show up in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's exactly the same thing because you </v>

492
00:21:46.031 --> 00:21:48.550
<v Speaker 1>are traveling through time and space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

493
00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:50.590
<v Speaker 1>And you need a map.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

494
00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:54.160
<v Speaker 1>so after you answer these seven </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions and you're encouraged to do it</v>

495
00:21:54.161 --> 00:21:57.220
<v Speaker 1>badly because you don't have to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfectionistic,</v>

496
00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:58.360
<v Speaker 1>just complete it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

497
00:21:58.361 --> 00:22:02.170
<v Speaker 1>Because a bad plan is better than no </v>
<v Speaker 1>plan gives you something to improve.</v>

498
00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:05.980
<v Speaker 1>So even if your aim is vague and even if</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's off target,</v>

499
00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:09.010
<v Speaker 1>if you start aiming and you see you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>off target,</v>

500
00:22:09.011 --> 00:22:11.020
<v Speaker 1>then you can shift and you can make it </v>
<v Speaker 1>more precise.</v>

501
00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:13.030
<v Speaker 1>Start to recognize what you don't want </v>
<v Speaker 1>in that.</v>

502
00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:13.900
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

503
00:22:13.901 --> 00:22:15.100
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I wanted this,</v>

504
00:22:15.101 --> 00:22:16.000
<v Speaker 1>but I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

505
00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:18.000
<v Speaker 1>Let me re navigate and figure out what I</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

506
00:22:18.001 --> 00:22:19.750
<v Speaker 1>Exactly and you to have to try a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

507
00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:21.610
<v Speaker 1>well you will have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be,</v>

508
00:22:21.611 --> 00:22:23.620
<v Speaker 1>that's why you shouldn't get </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfectionistic about it.</v>

509
00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:24.573
<v Speaker 1>You will absolutely be wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you won't be as wrong as you would </v>

510
00:22:27.201 --> 00:22:28.450
<v Speaker 1>have been if you were aimless.</v>

511
00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:29.381
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

512
00:22:29.381 --> 00:22:31.840
<v Speaker 1>So it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's a bit of no man's land,</v>

513
00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:36.280
<v Speaker 1>no man's land is norris.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then go men's room is a bit worse than a</v>

514
00:22:36.281 --> 00:22:38.230
<v Speaker 1>bad path.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly right.</v>

515
00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:40.600
<v Speaker 1>Like that's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good one.</v>

516
00:22:40.601 --> 00:22:41.770
<v Speaker 1>And it's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's right.</v>

517
00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:44.560
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to be a no man's land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did you use that phrase?</v>

518
00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:46.480
<v Speaker 1>Because that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly right.</v>

519
00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:47.343
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me the idea of walking around </v>

520
00:22:51.011 --> 00:22:54.370
<v Speaker 1>aimlessly is like the worst idea in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

521
00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:56.420
<v Speaker 1>It's like zero purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>zero mission,</v>

522
00:22:56.421 --> 00:22:57.254
<v Speaker 1>zero certainty at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like walking around in no man's </v>

523
00:22:59.831 --> 00:23:00.664
<v Speaker 1>land right aimlessly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's funny too because in no man's </v>

524
00:23:02.831 --> 00:23:04.150
<v Speaker 1>land,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody shooting at you.</v>

525
00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:07.000
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause that's a military term in no man's</v>

526
00:23:07.001 --> 00:23:09.300
<v Speaker 1>land is the space in the middle and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>positions,</v>

527
00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:11.140
<v Speaker 1>you bet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're aimless,</v>

528
00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:13.270
<v Speaker 1>you're also at a place where everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>is shooting at you.</v>

529
00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:16.000
<v Speaker 1>So it's a very good metaphor that came </v>
<v Speaker 1>to mind.</v>

530
00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:18.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's why that worked on it.</v>

531
00:23:18.131 --> 00:23:19.180
<v Speaker 1>That's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very cool.</v>

532
00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:21.250
<v Speaker 1>So then we say to people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay look now,</v>

533
00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:23.740
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you thought about this for a while.</v>

534
00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:25.690
<v Speaker 1>It's nice to do this over a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>days too,</v>

535
00:23:25.691 --> 00:23:28.450
<v Speaker 1>because then you get to sleep on it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that helps reorient yourself.</v>

536
00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:29.710
<v Speaker 1>So then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

537
00:23:29.711 --> 00:23:32.130
<v Speaker 1>now you write for 20 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry about grammar,</v>

538
00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:33.310
<v Speaker 1>spelling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This isn't a,</v>

539
00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:36.100
<v Speaker 1>this isn't a composition exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

540
00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:38.800
<v Speaker 1>You get to have what you want three to </v>
<v Speaker 1>five years down the road.</v>

541
00:23:39.010 --> 00:23:41.230
<v Speaker 1>What does your life look like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hypothetically?</v>

542
00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:42.460
<v Speaker 1>Write it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Write it out.</v>

543
00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:44.290
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then that's the first part,</v>

544
00:23:44.291 --> 00:23:45.124
<v Speaker 1>the second part of exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now you've got your thing d that you </v>

545
00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:47.961
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

546
00:23:47.961 --> 00:23:50.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm motivated because I got my thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think they map?</v>

547
00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:51.183
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're not as motivated as you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could be because you don't yet have you </v>

548
00:23:54.501 --> 00:23:55.790
<v Speaker 1>thing to run away from.</v>

549
00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:58.040
<v Speaker 1>Because if you really want to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivated,</v>

550
00:23:58.041 --> 00:24:01.760
<v Speaker 1>you want to be going somewhere and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to be not going somewhere else,</v>

551
00:24:01.761 --> 00:24:03.580
<v Speaker 1>which typically is a pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

552
00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:05.090
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or pain or anxiety,</v>

553
00:24:05.091 --> 00:24:07.670
<v Speaker 1>yet some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some domain of suffering and guilt.</v>

554
00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:09.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to feel this anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

555
00:24:09.651 --> 00:24:10.940
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

556
00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:13.130
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the other thing we ask people is,</v>

557
00:24:13.131 --> 00:24:13.964
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now take stock of your weaknesses and </v>

558
00:24:15.951 --> 00:24:16.784
<v Speaker 1>imagine that you let them multiply.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got hopeless and you ordered in and </v>

559
00:24:21.081 --> 00:24:23.780
<v Speaker 1>things were as bad for you as they could</v>
<v Speaker 1>be in three to five years.</v>

560
00:24:23.781 --> 00:24:26.840
<v Speaker 1>What are some examples of weaknesses </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people might have?</v>

561
00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.450
<v Speaker 1>They lie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they procrastinate,</v>

562
00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:32.990
<v Speaker 1>they avoid their grandiose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're narcissistic,</v>

563
00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:34.850
<v Speaker 1>they're undisciplined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

564
00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:37.010
<v Speaker 1>there are nihilistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're aimless.</v>

565
00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:38.810
<v Speaker 1>All of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

566
00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:40.760
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>victim mentality.</v>

567
00:24:40.761 --> 00:24:42.120
<v Speaker 1>They take the sh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they take the,</v>

568
00:24:42.121 --> 00:24:43.250
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the quick way out.</v>

569
00:24:43.251 --> 00:24:44.960
<v Speaker 1>They pursue and pleasures.</v>

570
00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:45.793
<v Speaker 1>They sacrifice meaning for expediency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't take care of their basic </v>

571
00:24:48.651 --> 00:24:51.620
<v Speaker 1>responsibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They fight stupidly with their parents.</v>

572
00:24:51.621 --> 00:24:53.990
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't negotiate properly with their</v>

573
00:24:53.991 --> 00:24:54.824
<v Speaker 1>spouse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are bitter at work because they </v>

574
00:24:56.271 --> 00:24:57.104
<v Speaker 1>haven't said what they have to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They haven't thought through what </v>

575
00:24:59.061 --> 00:25:01.070
<v Speaker 1>they're doing tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They drink too much.</v>

576
00:25:01.071 --> 00:25:02.930
<v Speaker 1>They smoked too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They take too many drugs.</v>

577
00:25:02.931 --> 00:25:05.560
<v Speaker 1>They don't regulate their there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

578
00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:07.333
<v Speaker 1>Everyone knows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone knows and everyone's got a set </v>

579
00:25:09.741 --> 00:25:12.500
<v Speaker 1>of weaknesses that they know about and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so we say,</v>

580
00:25:12.501 --> 00:25:14.420
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are some of your weaknesses?</v>

581
00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:15.313
<v Speaker 1>Like three weaknesses that you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now you could still work on it in </v>

582
00:25:17.601 --> 00:25:19.110
<v Speaker 1>three things that you think are really </v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

583
00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:19.963
<v Speaker 1>a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of things are things that I've </v>

584
00:25:21.291 --> 00:25:24.110
<v Speaker 1>taken care of in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I used to smoke when I was a kid.</v>

585
00:25:24.111 --> 00:25:25.190
<v Speaker 1>I smoked a pack a day.</v>

586
00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:27.980
<v Speaker 1>I used to drink a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't work out like there,</v>

587
00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:28.843
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there I wasn't nearly as disciplined as </v>

588
00:25:30.351 --> 00:25:31.184
<v Speaker 1>I should have been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't just careful with what I was </v>

589
00:25:33.111 --> 00:25:34.480
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>

590
00:25:35.250 --> 00:25:36.083
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose my most likely negative </v>

591
00:25:38.151 --> 00:25:40.790
<v Speaker 1>outcome probably would have been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really liked to drink.</v>

592
00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:42.470
<v Speaker 1>Like alcohol was a really good drug for </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

593
00:25:42.471 --> 00:25:44.780
<v Speaker 1>I want you to do losses on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

594
00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:49.550
<v Speaker 1>well partly it was mostly because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity came up for me,</v>

595
00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:50.061
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

596
00:25:50.061 --> 00:25:50.894
<v Speaker 1>to investigate drug and alcohol use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I came from a little town in </v>

597
00:25:53.331 --> 00:25:55.350
<v Speaker 1>northern Alberta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a heavy drinking town and,</v>

598
00:25:55.351 --> 00:25:56.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

599
00:25:56.570 --> 00:25:58.910
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that could have been a real trap for me,</v>

600
00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:00.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

601
00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:00.953
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

602
00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:03.510
<v Speaker 1>and so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we have these PPC,</v>

603
00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:04.403
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you know your weaknesses and you </v>

604
00:26:06.351 --> 00:26:07.184
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what particular hell you would descend </v>

605
00:26:08.091 --> 00:26:08.924
<v Speaker 1>to if you allowed yourself to descend </v>
<v Speaker 1>into it because you've probably had a </v>

606
00:26:11.031 --> 00:26:11.840
<v Speaker 1>taste of it.</v>

607
00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:12.673
<v Speaker 1>It's like you really let that go and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in a terrible place in three to </v>

608
00:26:14.991 --> 00:26:16.970
<v Speaker 1>five years because you haven't done what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should do.</v>

609
00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:20.030
<v Speaker 1>What does that look like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like everybody writes that down.</v>

610
00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:21.320
<v Speaker 1>Write it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

611
00:26:21.321 --> 00:26:23.570
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have behind you,</v>

612
00:26:23.571 --> 00:26:24.890
<v Speaker 1>let's say you have to do something </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult,</v>

613
00:26:24.891 --> 00:26:26.930
<v Speaker 1>like go confront your boss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

614
00:26:26.931 --> 00:26:28.940
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe hope isn't enough to encourage you</v>

615
00:26:28.941 --> 00:26:30.350
<v Speaker 1>to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>

616
00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:30.891
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

617
00:26:30.891 --> 00:26:34.250
<v Speaker 1>If I don't encourage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I don't go confront my boss carefully</v>

618
00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:35.630
<v Speaker 1>and intelligently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

619
00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:38.870
<v Speaker 1>then I'm going to hate my job and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to drink more.</v>

620
00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:42.680
<v Speaker 1>Then I'm going to end up in that little </v>
<v Speaker 1>hell place that I designed for myself.</v>

621
00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:43.291
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

622
00:26:43.291 --> 00:26:44.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

623
00:26:44.551 --> 00:26:45.384
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to talk to my boss or I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to confront my wife or my </v>

624
00:26:47.251 --> 00:26:48.210
<v Speaker 1>husband,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>

625
00:26:48.211 --> 00:26:50.610
<v Speaker 1>or my father or my children's for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter,</v>

626
00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:51.713
<v Speaker 1>but if I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I'll resent myself or I'm going </v>

627
00:26:55.351 --> 00:26:56.910
<v Speaker 1>down this terrible pathway.</v>

628
00:26:56.910 --> 00:26:57.743
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because sometimes when you moving </v>

629
00:26:59.731 --> 00:27:00.564
<v Speaker 1>forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to do something difficult and </v>

630
00:27:01.591 --> 00:27:02.490
<v Speaker 1>you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

631
00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:05.970
<v Speaker 1>why bother and answer is well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't end up in hell.</v>

632
00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:07.860
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

633
00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:10.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's that deep.</v>

634
00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:14.940
<v Speaker 1>If you don't experience the pain now or </v>
<v Speaker 1>the difficulty now,</v>

635
00:27:14.941 --> 00:27:16.680
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have a deeper pain </v>
<v Speaker 1>later.</v>

636
00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:17.161
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

637
00:27:17.161 --> 00:27:17.994
<v Speaker 1>That's life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Much deeper pain there and that's why I </v>

638
00:27:19.771 --> 00:27:24.250
<v Speaker 1>think at you mentioned at one point is </v>
<v Speaker 1>like putting ourselves in um,</v>

639
00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:28.770
<v Speaker 1>structured pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like structured in sense of feeling pain</v>

640
00:27:28.771 --> 00:27:31.080
<v Speaker 1>throughout the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether it be the tough conversation,</v>

641
00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:33.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's painful,</v>

642
00:27:33.061 --> 00:27:33.894
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to because I know </v>
<v Speaker 1>afterwards it's going to probably feel </v>

643
00:27:36.811 --> 00:27:38.670
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a bit of a sacrifice,</v>

644
00:27:38.671 --> 00:27:39.504
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you sacrifice stability in the </v>

645
00:27:40.711 --> 00:27:41.544
<v Speaker 1>present for a gain in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the big discovery of human </v>

646
00:27:43.801 --> 00:27:44.634
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>

647
00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:47.400
<v Speaker 1>Face works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were you a big athlete growing up?</v>

648
00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:48.300
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

649
00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:51.030
<v Speaker 1>but I know when I was a small kid and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>just skipped the grade,</v>

650
00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:52.043
<v Speaker 1>although I skied and I went cross </v>
<v Speaker 1>country skiing and he didn't see </v>

651
00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:56.220
<v Speaker 1>individual sports things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mostly with my dad.</v>

652
00:27:56.250 --> 00:27:59.730
<v Speaker 1>You understand that and in order to </v>
<v Speaker 1>improve as an athlete or in any sport,</v>

653
00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.510
<v Speaker 1>you have to put yourself through daily </v>
<v Speaker 1>pain.</v>

654
00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:02.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

655
00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:02.963
<v Speaker 1>If you want to achieve that model of </v>
<v Speaker 1>excellence that you watch someone </v>

656
00:28:05.611 --> 00:28:06.444
<v Speaker 1>playing basketball as a child and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>see someone living this model is going </v>

657
00:28:10.411 --> 00:28:15.411
<v Speaker 1>to be 15 years of deliberate pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a discipline that's it worked out</v>

658
00:28:15.751 --> 00:28:17.370
<v Speaker 1>for a long time with weights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

659
00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:19.030
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dealt it every day.</v>

660
00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:19.933
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to push through pain but </v>
<v Speaker 1>you knew that would get you a greater </v>

661
00:28:22.261 --> 00:28:22.631
<v Speaker 1>result.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

662
00:28:22.631 --> 00:28:24.510
<v Speaker 1>Well and it's easier not to do it then </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do it,</v>

663
00:28:24.511 --> 00:28:25.530
<v Speaker 1>but not in the long run.</v>

664
00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:27.233
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really seen the benefits for example </v>

665
00:28:28.711 --> 00:28:31.500
<v Speaker 1>for weightlifting cause I've watched </v>
<v Speaker 1>people cause I'm 58 50,</v>

666
00:28:31.501 --> 00:28:33.170
<v Speaker 1>how old am I?</v>
<v Speaker 1>56 is a great,</v>

667
00:28:33.171 --> 00:28:34.004
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm seeing as I'm getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>older and I really noticed the </v>

668
00:28:36.091 --> 00:28:38.430
<v Speaker 1>difference between people in when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>age,</v>

669
00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:39.543
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>between people who laid down a good </v>

670
00:28:41.041 --> 00:28:44.310
<v Speaker 1>physiological platform when they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>young and those who didn't.</v>

671
00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:45.173
<v Speaker 1>Because by the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you haven't worked out weights </v>

672
00:28:47.551 --> 00:28:48.384
<v Speaker 1>particularly I would say you start to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get pretty soft in your thirties and </v>

673
00:28:51.331 --> 00:28:54.090
<v Speaker 1>your cardiovascular system starts to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>and really early.</v>

674
00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:55.013
<v Speaker 1>They all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other thing too is the best thing </v>

675
00:28:55.951 --> 00:28:58.260
<v Speaker 1>you can do to maintain cognitive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

676
00:28:58.290 --> 00:29:01.560
<v Speaker 1>ability isn't to do exercises like </v>
<v Speaker 1>lumosity.</v>

677
00:29:01.561 --> 00:29:03.780
<v Speaker 1>It's not brain exercises that keep you </v>
<v Speaker 1>sharp.</v>

678
00:29:03.810 --> 00:29:06.390
<v Speaker 1>It's exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're 50,</v>

679
00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:09.060
<v Speaker 1>both cardiovascular and weight lifting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're 50,</v>

680
00:29:09.061 --> 00:29:09.894
<v Speaker 1>you can restore your cognitive function </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the level of a 30 year old through </v>

681
00:29:12.301 --> 00:29:13.134
<v Speaker 1>exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your mental function through physical </v>

682
00:29:16.301 --> 00:29:16.490
<v Speaker 1>lights.</v>

683
00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:17.323
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well your brain is a very demanding </v>

684
00:29:18.271 --> 00:29:19.104
<v Speaker 1>organ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if your cardiovascular system is </v>

685
00:29:20.431 --> 00:29:21.900
<v Speaker 1>compromised,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you get stupid.</v>

686
00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:23.131
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

687
00:29:23.131 --> 00:29:25.560
<v Speaker 1>it's really cool because as you move and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bigger you get,</v>

688
00:29:25.561 --> 00:29:27.290
<v Speaker 1>the more stupid you'd become.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mm hmm.</v>

689
00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:28.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

690
00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:29.753
<v Speaker 1>you compromise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you compromise its function because the </v>

691
00:29:31.471 --> 00:29:32.750
<v Speaker 1>brain is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

692
00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:35.010
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the organ that uses more.</v>

693
00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:37.170
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very metabolically demanding.</v>

694
00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:40.890
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're not in good physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>shape,</v>

695
00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:44.380
<v Speaker 1>then one of the things that suffers most</v>
<v Speaker 1>greatly as your cognitive function.</v>

696
00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:47.770
<v Speaker 1>And so that's quite an interesting thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>to see how tight that linkage is.</v>

697
00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:50.410
<v Speaker 1>So in the next part of the program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have people,</v>

698
00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:52.150
<v Speaker 1>now it's okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you've got your vision.</v>

699
00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:53.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if it's a bad one,</v>

700
00:29:53.921 --> 00:29:54.460
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

701
00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:56.470
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's better than no vision at all,</v>

702
00:29:56.471 --> 00:29:57.880
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something that you could improve.</v>

703
00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:58.833
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think you're trying to get through a </v>

704
00:30:00.341 --> 00:30:02.650
<v Speaker 1>territory you don't understand and </v>
<v Speaker 1>here's your option.</v>

705
00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:03.603
<v Speaker 1>No map a map that's not so good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but has some things about it or a great </v>

706
00:30:08.051 --> 00:30:10.750
<v Speaker 1>map while obviously the great map is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing you want,</v>

707
00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:11.823
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the map that something is way better </v>

708
00:30:13.811 --> 00:30:15.070
<v Speaker 1>than the map.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's nothing.</v>

709
00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:18.940
<v Speaker 1>Plus as you explore because of your map,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can start to fill in the details.</v>

710
00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:21.320
<v Speaker 1>You start to learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just start to overcome stuff and you</v>

711
00:30:21.321 --> 00:30:23.900
<v Speaker 1>start to master skills journey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

712
00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:25.323
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the other thing too is like </v>

713
00:30:26.111 --> 00:30:26.944
<v Speaker 1>let's say you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you aim at something and you and you </v>

714
00:30:28.601 --> 00:30:29.434
<v Speaker 1>develop some skills along the way and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you get like a third of the way </v>

715
00:30:32.291 --> 00:30:33.130
<v Speaker 1>there and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

716
00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:34.360
<v Speaker 1>that's not for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

717
00:30:34.361 --> 00:30:35.051
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

718
00:30:35.051 --> 00:30:35.884
<v Speaker 1>fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now you've still got the skills you </v>

719
00:30:37.721 --> 00:30:38.554
<v Speaker 1>developed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know exactly why it's not for you </v>

720
00:30:41.081 --> 00:30:43.490
<v Speaker 1>now instead of vaguely don't have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep going after that.</v>

721
00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:44.853
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well and you have a rationale and then </v>

722
00:30:46.871 --> 00:30:50.380
<v Speaker 1>you can bring that wisdom back even </v>
<v Speaker 1>though it's not perfect,</v>

723
00:30:50.381 --> 00:30:51.214
<v Speaker 1>you can bring it back to your next plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so take responsibility for the next </v>

724
00:30:54.341 --> 00:30:55.030
<v Speaker 1>steps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

725
00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:56.500
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so as you plan,</v>

726
00:30:56.501 --> 00:30:59.020
<v Speaker 1>you get better at planning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the crucial thing.</v>

727
00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:00.183
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then we say to people will take your </v>

728
00:31:01.571 --> 00:31:05.650
<v Speaker 1>pause division and make it into eight </v>
<v Speaker 1>stateable goals.</v>

729
00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:06.543
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So and then rank them in a hierarchy </v>

730
00:31:07.991 --> 00:31:11.060
<v Speaker 1>because you need to know what like a top</v>
<v Speaker 1>goal and then yeah.</v>

731
00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:12.150
<v Speaker 1>And incremental goals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

732
00:31:12.151 --> 00:31:12.571
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

733
00:31:12.571 --> 00:31:14.290
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's the other thing is break the</v>

734
00:31:14.291 --> 00:31:15.124
<v Speaker 1>goals into incremental goals so that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a reasonable probability of </v>

735
00:31:18.341 --> 00:31:19.930
<v Speaker 1>succeeding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So cause what you want to do,</v>

736
00:31:19.931 --> 00:31:21.640
<v Speaker 1>this is also what you want to do with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>kid.</v>

737
00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:25.930
<v Speaker 1>You don't tell your kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here is an impossible thing.</v>

738
00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:26.973
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you go out and fail?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say here's something worth going </v>

739
00:31:30.101 --> 00:31:30.934
<v Speaker 1>after.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the step you could take that </v>

740
00:31:32.411 --> 00:31:36.940
<v Speaker 1>would push you beyond where you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that you also have a reasonably high</v>

741
00:31:36.941 --> 00:31:39.100
<v Speaker 1>probability of succeeding yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

742
00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:41.740
<v Speaker 1>They'd call that in a timeframe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Within some time frame.</v>

743
00:31:41.741 --> 00:31:44.050
<v Speaker 1>That's the other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to parameterize it with regards</v>

744
00:31:44.051 --> 00:31:45.160
<v Speaker 1>to timeframe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

745
00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:47.890
<v Speaker 1>And that puts you in the zone of </v>
<v Speaker 1>proximal development.</v>

746
00:31:47.891 --> 00:31:50.350
<v Speaker 1>And that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a concept that was generated by a</v>

747
00:31:50.351 --> 00:31:51.184
<v Speaker 1>guy named [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a Russian developmental </v>

748
00:31:52.931 --> 00:31:53.764
<v Speaker 1>psychologist and the smart one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where the idea of the zone comes </v>

749
00:31:56.021 --> 00:31:58.600
<v Speaker 1>from to be in the zone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you're in the zone,</v>

750
00:31:58.990 --> 00:31:59.823
<v Speaker 1>you're expanding your skills at in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>manner that's intrinsically rewarding </v>

751
00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:07.390
<v Speaker 1>because you're succeeding and so you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to set,</v>

752
00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:08.980
<v Speaker 1>if you're good to yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

753
00:32:08.981 --> 00:32:10.210
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to set a goal,</v>

754
00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:11.463
<v Speaker 1>but I need to set a goal that someone is</v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid and useless as me could probably </v>

755
00:32:15.641 --> 00:32:16.090
<v Speaker 1>attain.</v>

756
00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:18.310
<v Speaker 1>If they put some effort into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you've got,</v>

757
00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:19.173
<v Speaker 1>then you've got it perfectly because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not so high that it's grandiose or </v>

758
00:32:22.091 --> 00:32:25.990
<v Speaker 1>impossible that you fail necessarily and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then justify your bitterness.</v>

759
00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:27.033
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I could do well done cause that </v>

760
00:32:28.091 --> 00:32:30.000
<v Speaker 1>happens to people all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

761
00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:32.040
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's,</v>

762
00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:32.920
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

763
00:32:32.921 --> 00:32:34.490
<v Speaker 1>While I set a goal and I didn't attain </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

764
00:32:34.491 --> 00:32:36.640
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm not gonna set any more goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

765
00:32:36.641 --> 00:32:37.474
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you set a goal that was inappropriate </v>

766
00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:40.440
<v Speaker 1>for the timeframe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

767
00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:42.860
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't calibrate it properly and you</v>

768
00:32:42.861 --> 00:32:43.694
<v Speaker 1>were playing a trick on yourself because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want it to fail so that you could </v>

769
00:32:45.651 --> 00:32:48.500
<v Speaker 1>justify not having to try.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm being a victim.</v>

770
00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:51.980
<v Speaker 1>It's just helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're still going to be a victim.</v>

771
00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:53.990
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's no way out of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

772
00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:57.260
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because life is this life is a challenge</v>

773
00:32:57.261 --> 00:32:59.180
<v Speaker 1>that in some sense can be surmounted.</v>

774
00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:00.013
<v Speaker 1>So there's no way out of your problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there is certainly proper ways of </v>

775
00:33:02.901 --> 00:33:03.734
<v Speaker 1>dealing with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

776
00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:07.460
<v Speaker 1>And so you lay out those eight steps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lay them out,</v>

777
00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:08.870
<v Speaker 1>and then the next thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

778
00:33:08.871 --> 00:33:09.704
<v Speaker 1>you need a rationale for them because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have doubts and other </v>

779
00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:14.700
<v Speaker 1>gonna people are gonna put up obstacles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that mean to me?</v>

780
00:33:14.790 --> 00:33:16.380
<v Speaker 1>Is that a Mimi rationale?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Means A,</v>

781
00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:17.840
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Justification.</v>

782
00:33:17.841 --> 00:33:18.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

783
00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:19.520
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so here,</v>

784
00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:22.730
<v Speaker 1>what sort of justification is a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>justification for your goals?</v>

785
00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:25.250
<v Speaker 1>It's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would it be good for you?</v>

786
00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:26.383
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would it be good for your family if </v>

787
00:33:28.071 --> 00:33:28.904
<v Speaker 1>you attain that goal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would it be good for the broader </v>

788
00:33:30.471 --> 00:33:32.480
<v Speaker 1>community?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if it's a good goal,</v>

789
00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:35.060
<v Speaker 1>it should be good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>

790
00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:36.253
<v Speaker 1>But if it's a really good goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it should be good for you in a way </v>

791
00:33:37.701 --> 00:33:38.750
<v Speaker 1>that's good for other people.</v>

792
00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:39.941
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

793
00:33:39.941 --> 00:33:40.774
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you're going to decide what your </v>

794
00:33:42.021 --> 00:33:46.460
<v Speaker 1>goals are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why not set up the ones that benefit the</v>

795
00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:48.860
<v Speaker 1>largest number of people simultaneous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

796
00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:49.773
<v Speaker 1>If you can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should start with your own concerns </v>

797
00:33:51.591 --> 00:33:53.720
<v Speaker 1>cause you have to take care of yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>needs first.</v>

798
00:33:53.721 --> 00:33:55.880
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Put Your own oxygen mask on,</v>

799
00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.320
<v Speaker 1>then put your child's oxygen mask on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

800
00:33:58.620 --> 00:33:59.930
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you can,</v>

801
00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:01.460
<v Speaker 1>as you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you build up a,</v>

802
00:34:01.610 --> 00:34:02.443
<v Speaker 1>the basis of competence locally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might develop enough skills so that </v>

803
00:34:05.751 --> 00:34:06.584
<v Speaker 1>you can expand that outward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it also gives your goal a certain </v>

804
00:34:08.961 --> 00:34:09.794
<v Speaker 1>amount of nobility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if someone challenges you and </v>

805
00:34:11.961 --> 00:34:13.160
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well why are you doing that?</v>

806
00:34:13.490 --> 00:34:14.323
<v Speaker 1>That seems stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could say I'm doing that because it </v>

807
00:34:16.041 --> 00:34:18.860
<v Speaker 1>helps me take care of myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it benefits my family.</v>

808
00:34:18.861 --> 00:34:19.694
<v Speaker 1>And here's the reasons why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is the repercussions out into </v>

809
00:34:21.801 --> 00:34:22.790
<v Speaker 1>the broader community.</v>

810
00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:23.893
<v Speaker 1>And like people aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are putting up objections in </v>

811
00:34:26.241 --> 00:34:27.074
<v Speaker 1>doubts aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't armed to deal with that kind of </v>

812
00:34:29.151 --> 00:34:29.984
<v Speaker 1>response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when you have those doubts in </v>

813
00:34:31.251 --> 00:34:32.084
<v Speaker 1>your mind that plague you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which they go back to your reason to go </v>

814
00:34:35.091 --> 00:34:37.130
<v Speaker 1>back to your reasons why it's right to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

815
00:34:37.131 --> 00:34:38.360
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why am I doing this?</v>

816
00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:39.320
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because,</v>

817
00:34:39.321 --> 00:34:40.154
<v Speaker 1>well I have to take care of myself </v>
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise I'm pathetic and </v>

818
00:34:41.661 --> 00:34:45.410
<v Speaker 1>useless and bitter and cruel and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going somewhere terrible.</v>

819
00:34:45.411 --> 00:34:46.244
<v Speaker 1>So that's a bad idea and here's how it </v>
<v Speaker 1>would help my family and here's how it </v>

820
00:34:49.161 --> 00:34:49.994
<v Speaker 1>would help the community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's good enough set of reasons </v>

821
00:34:51.651 --> 00:34:53.420
<v Speaker 1>for it unless I can think of better </v>
<v Speaker 1>ones.</v>

822
00:34:53.450 --> 00:34:54.260
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

823
00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:55.940
<v Speaker 1>Without better ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's good enough.</v>

824
00:34:55.941 --> 00:34:59.270
<v Speaker 1>Because I think the question comes back </v>
<v Speaker 1>to after,</v>

825
00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:00.313
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone could go down the rabbit hole </v>

826
00:35:01.521 --> 00:35:02.121
<v Speaker 1>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>

827
00:35:02.121 --> 00:35:04.280
<v Speaker 1>why am I doing this and why is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

828
00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:06.020
<v Speaker 1>meaningful for me.</v>

829
00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:08.380
<v Speaker 1>And I think a lot of people go back to </v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

830
00:35:08.381 --> 00:35:09.810
<v Speaker 1>why am I here on the first?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

831
00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:11.780
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why am I here?</v>

832
00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:13.033
<v Speaker 1>What is the meaning of my life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And is this real or is this just some </v>

833
00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:18.860
<v Speaker 1>dreamworld?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

834
00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:19.873
<v Speaker 1>and then in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then people do go back to that and then </v>

835
00:35:21.291 --> 00:35:22.850
<v Speaker 1>they get stuck on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

836
00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:23.873
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but none of this even matters because </v>

837
00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:26.510
<v Speaker 1>why am I even here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

838
00:35:26.770 --> 00:35:27.603
<v Speaker 1>the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that that's a self defeating set of </v>

839
00:35:29.601 --> 00:35:33.140
<v Speaker 1>propositions in some sense because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the consequence of being stuck.</v>

840
00:35:33.141 --> 00:35:33.974
<v Speaker 1>There is no reason you stuck there to </v>
<v Speaker 1>begin with is because you're not very </v>

841
00:35:36.741 --> 00:35:37.574
<v Speaker 1>happy about the fact that life is </v>
<v Speaker 1>intrinsically tied up with suffering </v>

842
00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:42.450
<v Speaker 1>because he wouldn't be asking that </v>
<v Speaker 1>question to begin with.</v>

843
00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:43.673
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you let that pull you in and take </v>

844
00:35:44.641 --> 00:35:46.680
<v Speaker 1>you down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all it does is make the suffering worse,</v>

845
00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:47.820
<v Speaker 1>not helpful.</v>

846
00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:48.893
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the cascade that we talked </v>

847
00:35:50.311 --> 00:35:52.650
<v Speaker 1>about happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You suffer stupidly and pointless.</v>

848
00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:54.690
<v Speaker 1>You get bitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give cruel,</v>

849
00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:57.720
<v Speaker 1>you make everything worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's your answer is it?</v>

850
00:35:57.870 --> 00:35:59.850
<v Speaker 1>You're going to make everything worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's bad enough,</v>

851
00:35:59.851 --> 00:36:03.480
<v Speaker 1>you're going to make it worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mostly people won't do that consciously.</v>

852
00:36:04.170 --> 00:36:04.951
<v Speaker 1>So you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

853
00:36:04.951 --> 00:36:06.120
<v Speaker 1>what's the alternative?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

854
00:36:06.121 --> 00:36:09.330
<v Speaker 1>here's one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have a sufficiently noble purpose</v>

855
00:36:09.331 --> 00:36:12.120
<v Speaker 1>to suffering will justify itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>

856
00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:12.983
<v Speaker 1>I think that's empirically testable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I do believe it's the case because </v>

857
00:36:15.721 --> 00:36:16.554
<v Speaker 1>I've watched people do very difficult </v>
<v Speaker 1>things like people who work in </v>

858
00:36:18.511 --> 00:36:19.344
<v Speaker 1>Palliative care wards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all they're ever dealing with his </v>

859
00:36:21.361 --> 00:36:22.830
<v Speaker 1>pain and death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

860
00:36:22.831 --> 00:36:25.440
<v Speaker 1>And they can do it and get up in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>morning,</v>

861
00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:27.600
<v Speaker 1>they go to work and they take care of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those people.</v>

862
00:36:27.601 --> 00:36:31.080
<v Speaker 1>They lose people on a weekly basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yet they can do it.</v>

863
00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:32.273
<v Speaker 1>And what that shows is that if you turn </v>
<v Speaker 1>around and you confront the suffering </v>

864
00:36:35.941 --> 00:36:36.774
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you find out that you are way tougher </v>

865
00:36:38.551 --> 00:36:39.384
<v Speaker 1>than you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that life is better than you </v>

866
00:36:41.161 --> 00:36:41.994
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Life is as harsh as you think it might </v>

867
00:36:43.741 --> 00:36:44.574
<v Speaker 1>even be worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you are way tougher than you think </v>

868
00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:47.993
<v Speaker 1>if you turn around and confronted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then what you discover is that </v>

869
00:36:50.701 --> 00:36:53.070
<v Speaker 1>there's a spirit within you that </v>
<v Speaker 1>pursues,</v>

870
00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:57.510
<v Speaker 1>that can pursue something meaningful </v>
<v Speaker 1>that has the resilience and the strength</v>

871
00:36:57.511 --> 00:37:02.070
<v Speaker 1>to contend properly with the catastrophe</v>
<v Speaker 1>of existence without becoming bitter.</v>

872
00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:04.080
<v Speaker 1>That's actually the central.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

873
00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:05.293
<v Speaker 1>and then I would say that's one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>central themes of 12 rules for life is </v>

874
00:37:07.681 --> 00:37:08.514
<v Speaker 1>that make no mistake about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the first noble truth of Buddhism </v>

875
00:37:11.850 --> 00:37:12.683
<v Speaker 1>life is suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is true and it's worse than that </v>

876
00:37:15.301 --> 00:37:17.880
<v Speaker 1>because it's suffering contaminated by </v>
<v Speaker 1>malevolence.</v>

877
00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:19.530
<v Speaker 1>That's the baseline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

878
00:37:19.531 --> 00:37:20.364
<v Speaker 1>and so that's very pessimistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the optimistic part is that you are </v>

879
00:37:23.491 --> 00:37:24.324
<v Speaker 1>so damn tough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can actually not only deal with </v>

880
00:37:25.711 --> 00:37:26.810
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can improve it.</v>

881
00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:29.850
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh well that's a horrible situation.</v>

882
00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:32.190
<v Speaker 1>But it turns out that I'm armed for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>task.</v>

883
00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:34.620
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a great thing for people to know.</v>

884
00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:35.573
<v Speaker 1>And I do believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the fact that we're armed for </v>

885
00:37:37.621 --> 00:37:42.621
<v Speaker 1>the task is even more true than the fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>that life is catastrophe contaminated by</v>

886
00:37:42.691 --> 00:37:45.720
<v Speaker 1>malevolence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're stronger than things are terrible,</v>

887
00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:47.580
<v Speaker 1>so hadn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things are pretty terrible,</v>

888
00:37:47.730 --> 00:37:50.010
<v Speaker 1>so that means we're pretty damn strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

889
00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:51.053
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very good thing to know and it's </v>

890
00:37:52.621 --> 00:37:55.770
<v Speaker 1>not naive optimism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very different thing.</v>

891
00:37:55.771 --> 00:37:57.720
<v Speaker 1>It's like no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things are terrible.</v>

892
00:37:57.750 --> 00:38:00.060
<v Speaker 1>They're brutal and you are so damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>tough.</v>

893
00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:03.150
<v Speaker 1>You can't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So wow.</v>

894
00:38:03.210 --> 00:38:04.043
<v Speaker 1>What's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's been the biggest challenge in </v>

895
00:38:05.131 --> 00:38:05.964
<v Speaker 1>your life that you've had to overcome or</v>
<v Speaker 1>the biggest suffering that took you the </v>

896
00:38:08.731 --> 00:38:11.070
<v Speaker 1>longest to get beyond to improve?</v>

897
00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:35.130
<v Speaker 1>Having them bring you down is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>helping the person who has the problem.</v>

898
00:38:35.410 --> 00:38:37.000
<v Speaker 1>It's the same with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with my daughter.</v>

899
00:38:37.001 --> 00:38:41.920
<v Speaker 1>It's like had my wife and I deteriorated</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a consequence of her condition.</v>

900
00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:42.933
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would have been horrible for her </v>

901
00:38:43.721 --> 00:38:44.554
<v Speaker 1>because then she would have had to bear </v>
<v Speaker 1>the weight of watching her illness </v>

902
00:38:46.661 --> 00:38:48.430
<v Speaker 1>destroy her family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

903
00:38:48.431 --> 00:38:49.510
<v Speaker 1>Which have that killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

904
00:38:49.511 --> 00:38:50.620
<v Speaker 1>Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

905
00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:51.513
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the terrible things about </v>

906
00:38:52.211 --> 00:38:55.390
<v Speaker 1>having a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very bad illness is that not only does</v>

907
00:38:55.391 --> 00:38:56.224
<v Speaker 1>it do you in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can see it taking its toll on </v>

908
00:38:58.451 --> 00:39:00.580
<v Speaker 1>the people around you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that might even be worse.</v>

909
00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:14.103
<v Speaker 2>Hm.</v>

910
00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:18.980
<v Speaker 3>Welcome everyone.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Good to see you,</v>

<v Speaker 3>And very excited about this.</v>

914
00:39:24.171 --> 00:39:26.660
<v Speaker 3>You've got a book out called 12 rules </v>
<v Speaker 3>for life.</v>

915
00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:29.150
<v Speaker 3>Makes you guys check this out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've probably already got it,</v>

916
00:39:29.151 --> 00:39:29.984
<v Speaker 3>but if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you to go pick it up right </v>

917
00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:33.200
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>An antidote to chaos.</v>

918
00:39:33.650 --> 00:39:36.830
<v Speaker 3>What's been the biggest challenge in </v>
<v Speaker 3>your life that you've had to overcome or</v>

919
00:39:36.831 --> 00:39:40.210
<v Speaker 3>the biggest suffering that took you the </v>
<v Speaker 3>longest to get beyond</v>

920
00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:42.400
<v Speaker 1>to improve?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

921
00:39:42.401 --> 00:39:43.234
<v Speaker 1>I think that was probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote about this in the last chapter </v>

922
00:39:45.941 --> 00:39:47.730
<v Speaker 1>of my book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is called Pedicab.</v>

923
00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:49.900
<v Speaker 1>When you encounter one in the street and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about,</v>

924
00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:51.660
<v Speaker 1>it's about dealing with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

925
00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:52.503
<v Speaker 1>when you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the worst thing that can happen </v>

926
00:39:53.501 --> 00:39:54.940
<v Speaker 1>to you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

927
00:39:55.210 --> 00:39:56.043
<v Speaker 1>I think the worst thing is that you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something really horrible and you screw </v>

928
00:39:58.031 --> 00:39:59.740
<v Speaker 1>up your life in everyone's life around </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

929
00:39:59.750 --> 00:40:01.780
<v Speaker 1>If that's yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

930
00:40:01.790 --> 00:40:03.400
<v Speaker 1>And you have to live with knowing you </v>
<v Speaker 1>did it.</v>

931
00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:04.690
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's rough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

932
00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:05.710
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see it's worse.</v>

933
00:40:05.830 --> 00:40:06.920
<v Speaker 1>Sky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

934
00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:11.020
<v Speaker 1>Remember there are worse things than </v>
<v Speaker 1>dying.</v>

935
00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:12.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes there are.</v>

936
00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:13.420
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

937
00:40:13.421 --> 00:40:14.050
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

938
00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:15.740
<v Speaker 1>that's that bad thing man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

939
00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:17.133
<v Speaker 1>but I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hardest existential situation that </v>

940
00:40:20.541 --> 00:40:23.630
<v Speaker 1>I've been in is the situation with my </v>
<v Speaker 1>daughter because she was very,</v>

941
00:40:23.631 --> 00:40:27.740
<v Speaker 1>very ill and she had rheumatoid </v>
<v Speaker 1>arthritis,</v>

942
00:40:27.830 --> 00:40:29.870
<v Speaker 1>she had arthritis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't rheumatoid type.</v>

943
00:40:29.870 --> 00:40:34.450
<v Speaker 1>And she had 40 affected joints that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>started to bother her when she was two,</v>

944
00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:35.633
<v Speaker 1>but really manifested itself fully when </v>
<v Speaker 1>she was six and some of the medical </v>

945
00:40:39.921 --> 00:40:42.890
<v Speaker 1>treatment help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when she was 15,</v>

946
00:40:42.891 --> 00:40:45.140
<v Speaker 1>14,</v>
<v Speaker 1>14 through 16,</v>

947
00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:47.900
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first her hip disintegrated.</v>

948
00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:49.250
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then her.</v>

949
00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:50.233
<v Speaker 1>And so she had that replaced after </v>
<v Speaker 1>walking around on it for like a good </v>

950
00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:54.103
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then her ankle disintegrated on her </v>

951
00:40:55.401 --> 00:40:57.200
<v Speaker 1>other foot and she had to have yet </v>
<v Speaker 1>replaced.</v>

952
00:40:57.590 --> 00:41:01.490
<v Speaker 1>And so there were two years of </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely brutal pain for her,</v>

953
00:41:01.550 --> 00:41:04.730
<v Speaker 1>like brutal daily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>excruciating pain.</v>

954
00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:07.490
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we were really running around trying</v>

955
00:41:07.491 --> 00:41:08.324
<v Speaker 1>to figure out what to do about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the hip wasn't too hard to </v>

956
00:41:10.311 --> 00:41:11.420
<v Speaker 1>replace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

957
00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:15.080
<v Speaker 1>because surgeons are actually pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>good at hip replacements,</v>

958
00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:18.750
<v Speaker 1>but ankles are still so many bones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

959
00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:20.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

960
00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:22.130
<v Speaker 1>and just watching that and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

961
00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:23.113
<v Speaker 1>and while watching what it was doing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>her because she was in enough pain at </v>

962
00:41:26.961 --> 00:41:28.730
<v Speaker 1>one point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just about broker.</v>

963
00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:29.951
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

964
00:41:29.951 --> 00:41:30.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and I,</v>

965
00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:31.573
<v Speaker 1>you've probably been on a situation </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you were in pain for a night and </v>

966
00:41:33.891 --> 00:41:34.850
<v Speaker 1>couldn't sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

967
00:41:34.851 --> 00:41:35.481
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

968
00:41:35.481 --> 00:41:38.300
<v Speaker 1>So multiply that by five and extended </v>
<v Speaker 1>over two years.</v>

969
00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:40.610
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

970
00:41:40.611 --> 00:41:44.210
<v Speaker 1>And she was on like huge doses of </v>
<v Speaker 1>opiates and so that was sedating her and</v>

971
00:41:44.211 --> 00:41:45.044
<v Speaker 1>so that made it look drunk in public and</v>
<v Speaker 1>she can only stay awake for about six </v>

972
00:41:47.811 --> 00:41:48.644
<v Speaker 1>hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she had to take Ritalin to stay </v>

973
00:41:49.551 --> 00:41:51.790
<v Speaker 1>awake because otherwise she was just </v>
<v Speaker 1>sleeping all the time.</v>

974
00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:54.620
<v Speaker 1>And it was a very bad auto immune </v>
<v Speaker 1>condition.</v>

975
00:41:54.621 --> 00:41:55.454
<v Speaker 1>And so it wasn't the only manifest in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the juke joint deterioration and the </v>

976
00:41:59.001 --> 00:41:59.834
<v Speaker 1>pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because arthritis is also very painful </v>

977
00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:05.310
<v Speaker 1>and 40 joints happens to be quite a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one joint was brewed.</v>

978
00:42:05.350 --> 00:42:06.183
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

979
00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:08.540
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was absolutely brutal.</v>

980
00:42:08.541 --> 00:42:09.374
<v Speaker 1>Beyond belief as a father or a parent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you navigate that emotionally </v>

981
00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:14.360
<v Speaker 1>yourself?</v>

982
00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:16.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's what that chapter's about.</v>

983
00:42:16.191 --> 00:42:17.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

984
00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:19.580
<v Speaker 1>so what do you do when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when things are too much?</v>

985
00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:20.863
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the answers is you narrow your </v>

986
00:42:23.211 --> 00:42:24.044
<v Speaker 1>timeframe and now they're answer is you </v>
<v Speaker 1>look for occasions of grace and beauty </v>

987
00:42:29.091 --> 00:42:32.960
<v Speaker 1>where you can get the swelling had a dog</v>
<v Speaker 1>that really helped,</v>

988
00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:34.513
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was something that was with her </v>

989
00:42:35.811 --> 00:42:36.644
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we tried to put things in her life </v>

990
00:42:38.271 --> 00:42:39.460
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that she,</v>

991
00:42:39.461 --> 00:42:41.540
<v Speaker 1>she could care for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had a whole raft of Pat's,</v>

992
00:42:41.541 --> 00:42:43.130
<v Speaker 1>although she was allergic to almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

993
00:42:43.131 --> 00:42:45.050
<v Speaker 1>So most of them were lizards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

994
00:42:45.051 --> 00:42:47.000
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get her getting up.</v>

995
00:42:47.770 --> 00:42:48.471
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

996
00:42:48.471 --> 00:42:50.560
<v Speaker 1>I love this Guinea pig.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

997
00:42:50.830 --> 00:42:51.663
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three hours later she'd have a big </v>

998
00:42:52.371 --> 00:42:57.140
<v Speaker 1>round.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We take the Guinea big Bi Harry's dog.</v>

999
00:42:57.890 --> 00:42:58.723
<v Speaker 1>So the dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>luckily the dog she could tolerate and </v>

1000
00:43:00.561 --> 00:43:04.640
<v Speaker 1>so we had the dog for her and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things you do when you're</v>

1001
00:43:04.641 --> 00:43:07.940
<v Speaker 1>in a situation like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a bloody ongoing nightmare,</v>

1002
00:43:07.941 --> 00:43:10.460
<v Speaker 1>is that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shrink your timeframe.</v>

1003
00:43:10.490 --> 00:43:12.230
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what are we going to do in a year?</v>

1004
00:43:12.231 --> 00:43:13.130
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

1005
00:43:13.131 --> 00:43:15.530
<v Speaker 1>we can't even think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about six months.</v>

1006
00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:16.970
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1007
00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:19.610
<v Speaker 1>a week tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today.</v>

1008
00:43:19.850 --> 00:43:21.860
<v Speaker 1>The next hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1009
00:43:21.861 --> 00:43:22.694
<v Speaker 1>So that's what you really do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You shrink your timeframe until you can </v>

1010
00:43:25.131 --> 00:43:27.180
<v Speaker 1>tolerate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're not planning out year.</v>

1011
00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:29.690
<v Speaker 1>Cause then you'll go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's too much uncertainty.</v>

1012
00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:30.591
<v Speaker 1>You just think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1013
00:43:30.591 --> 00:43:33.320
<v Speaker 1>how can I make the next hour the least </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of awful possible?</v>

1014
00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:35.210
<v Speaker 1>That's what you do at someone's </v>
<v Speaker 1>deathbed.</v>

1015
00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:38.450
<v Speaker 1>You shrink your timeframe and that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you have to do.</v>

1016
00:43:38.570 --> 00:43:40.280
<v Speaker 1>How does that play into the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1017
00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:43.700
<v Speaker 1>the self authoring program?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have this vision for yourself and</v>

1018
00:43:43.701 --> 00:43:45.140
<v Speaker 1>you're mapping out a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

1019
00:43:45.141 --> 00:43:46.340
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five years ahead.</v>

1020
00:43:46.370 --> 00:43:47.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well sometimes,</v>

1021
00:43:47.281 --> 00:43:48.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>navigate.</v>

1022
00:43:48.410 --> 00:43:49.101
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

1023
00:43:49.101 --> 00:43:50.060
<v Speaker 1>You have to read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>navigate.</v>

1024
00:43:50.070 --> 00:43:51.320
<v Speaker 1>You have to say no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fit it into that.</v>

1025
00:43:51.321 --> 00:43:54.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because even the best laid plans of mice</v>

1026
00:43:54.111 --> 00:43:55.130
<v Speaker 1>and men go astray.</v>

1027
00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:57.470
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's part of being a lot and so</v>

1028
00:43:57.590 --> 00:43:59.100
<v Speaker 1>you have your map,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1029
00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:02.090
<v Speaker 1>if you get a flat tire along the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you still have to stop and fix your car.</v>

1030
00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:04.040
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the bloody thing bursts into </v>
<v Speaker 1>flames.</v>

1031
00:44:04.090 --> 00:44:06.260
<v Speaker 1>You have to get a new car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1032
00:44:06.261 --> 00:44:07.910
<v Speaker 1>so I mean you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1033
00:44:07.930 --> 00:44:12.680
<v Speaker 1>you're asset towards your goals can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>punctuated by unexpected catastrophe and</v>

1034
00:44:12.681 --> 00:44:14.960
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then hopefully you've made yourself</v>

1035
00:44:14.961 --> 00:44:15.794
<v Speaker 1>into a resilient person at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the catastrophe is no worse than it </v>

1036
00:44:19.491 --> 00:44:22.580
<v Speaker 1>has to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're not making it worse.</v>

1037
00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:23.623
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things we were fortunate </v>

1038
00:44:24.501 --> 00:44:27.860
<v Speaker 1>about is that by the time she got really</v>
<v Speaker 1>ill,</v>

1039
00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:29.203
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my relationship with my wife was pretty </v>

1040
00:44:30.741 --> 00:44:33.450
<v Speaker 1>well together and my relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 1>my son,</v>

1041
00:44:33.451 --> 00:44:35.790
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's younger than her was also well put</v>

1042
00:44:35.791 --> 00:44:36.624
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he was an absolute trooper men </v>

1043
00:44:38.310 --> 00:44:39.143
<v Speaker 1>because most of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a lot of his teenage life in </v>

1044
00:44:41.791 --> 00:44:42.624
<v Speaker 1>particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a huge amount of focus on the </v>

1045
00:44:44.401 --> 00:44:45.690
<v Speaker 1>suffering of his sister.</v>

1046
00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:47.580
<v Speaker 1>And we were like right up to here with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1047
00:44:47.581 --> 00:44:49.020
<v Speaker 1>It was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was enough.</v>

1048
00:44:49.290 --> 00:44:53.010
<v Speaker 1>And he conducted himself admirably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't,</v>

1049
00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:55.590
<v Speaker 1>if he cause trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we didn't know about it.</v>

1050
00:44:55.710 --> 00:44:57.180
<v Speaker 1>He kept it to himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1051
00:44:57.181 --> 00:44:58.014
<v Speaker 1>and I don't mean he was hiding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he dealt with it and he spent a </v>

1052
00:45:00.751 --> 00:45:05.130
<v Speaker 1>lot of time at home and he didn't do any</v>
<v Speaker 1>unnecessarily stupid things.</v>

1053
00:45:05.310 --> 00:45:06.143
<v Speaker 1>And he put up with his sister and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>parents who were on edge a lot without </v>

1054
00:45:09.421 --> 00:45:12.210
<v Speaker 1>adding additional catastrophe and misery</v>
<v Speaker 1>and grief to it.</v>

1055
00:45:12.211 --> 00:45:16.380
<v Speaker 1>And when she was a little bit crazy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>was leaning on him too hard or bothering</v>

1056
00:45:16.381 --> 00:45:17.214
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was there to support her and it was </v>

1057
00:45:18.511 --> 00:45:20.970
<v Speaker 1>massively helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1058
00:45:20.971 --> 00:45:21.804
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't any more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my wife and I weren't any more crazy </v>

1059
00:45:23.971 --> 00:45:24.804
<v Speaker 1>towards each other then we had to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there wasn't like any additional </v>

1060
00:45:29.191 --> 00:45:31.620
<v Speaker 1>stress during those periods of time sunk</v>
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

1061
00:45:32.490 --> 00:45:33.970
<v Speaker 1>Any extra would have been like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1062
00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:35.730
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

1063
00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:40.260
<v Speaker 1>How are you able to compartmentalize or </v>
<v Speaker 1>just focus on your,</v>

1064
00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:43.080
<v Speaker 1>your career at that time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1065
00:45:43.081 --> 00:45:45.290
<v Speaker 1>lecturing or writing or whatever it may </v>
<v Speaker 1>be at,</v>

1066
00:45:45.330 --> 00:45:47.610
<v Speaker 1>well that's also part of the vision of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hell.</v>

1067
00:45:47.611 --> 00:45:48.331
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1068
00:45:48.331 --> 00:45:49.164
<v Speaker 1>what's the alternative?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You let things go and you make them </v>

1069
00:45:51.061 --> 00:45:53.130
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like not showing up and yeah,</v>

1070
00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:54.750
<v Speaker 1>just don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no excuse for that.</v>

1071
00:45:54.751 --> 00:45:56.730
<v Speaker 1>It's like you can't you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did you say?</v>

1072
00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:58.830
<v Speaker 1>Was there a con compartmentalizing of </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1073
00:45:58.831 --> 00:45:59.664
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's nine o'clock or eight o'clock in </v>

1074
00:46:00.781 --> 00:46:03.310
<v Speaker 1>the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to work and then yeah,</v>

1075
00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:05.460
<v Speaker 1>we made rules and we talked about some </v>
<v Speaker 1>of them,</v>

1076
00:46:05.461 --> 00:46:06.294
<v Speaker 1>like some of the rules were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we didn't talk about my daughter </v>

1077
00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:10.020
<v Speaker 1>daughter's illness after eight o'clock </v>
<v Speaker 1>at night.</v>

1078
00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:12.780
<v Speaker 1>That was the rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like no sanity.</v>

1079
00:46:12.910 --> 00:46:14.760
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a war.</v>

1080
00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:18.720
<v Speaker 1>You wear yourself out in a week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your dad and everyone suffers a lot.</v>

1081
00:46:18.721 --> 00:46:21.240
<v Speaker 1>So you've got to keep going through </v>
<v Speaker 1>however long this is going to be.</v>

1082
00:46:21.241 --> 00:46:22.560
<v Speaker 1>And so what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you have to do?</v>

1083
00:46:22.561 --> 00:46:23.394
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to sleep,</v>

1084
00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:26.130
<v Speaker 1>you have to sleep or things are going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go bad.</v>

1085
00:46:26.830 --> 00:46:27.511
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

1086
00:46:27.511 --> 00:46:29.730
<v Speaker 1>It's time to stop talking and go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep,</v>

1087
00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:32.120
<v Speaker 1>so you have to cut off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1088
00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:32.993
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I had learned some of that because </v>

1089
00:46:33.751 --> 00:46:34.584
<v Speaker 1>I've been a clinical psychologist for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>long time and so I've been dealing with </v>

1090
00:46:37.111 --> 00:46:39.630
<v Speaker 1>people's problems and you learn how to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1091
00:46:39.631 --> 00:46:40.051
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1092
00:46:40.051 --> 00:46:43.110
<v Speaker 1>how can you go home when when you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of those problems to contend with,</v>

1093
00:46:43.111 --> 00:46:43.590
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1094
00:46:43.590 --> 00:46:44.423
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are not your problems not going </v>

1095
00:46:46.801 --> 00:46:47.634
<v Speaker 1>away right now and they're not going </v>
<v Speaker 1>away and and having them bring you down </v>

1096
00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:53.640
<v Speaker 1>is not helping the person who has the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

1097
00:46:53.850 --> 00:46:58.410
<v Speaker 1>It's the same with with my daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like had my wife and I deteriorated</v>

1098
00:46:58.620 --> 00:47:00.810
<v Speaker 1>as a consequence of her condition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>

1099
00:47:00.811 --> 00:47:01.644
<v Speaker 1>that would have been horrible for her </v>
<v Speaker 1>because then she would have had to bear </v>

1100
00:47:03.511 --> 00:47:06.420
<v Speaker 1>the weight of watching her illness </v>
<v Speaker 1>destroy her family.</v>

1101
00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:07.740
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd have that guilt.</v>

1102
00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:08.581
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ.</v>

1103
00:47:08.581 --> 00:47:09.301
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1104
00:47:09.301 --> 00:47:11.210
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the terrible things about </v>
<v Speaker 1>having a,</v>

1105
00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:14.610
<v Speaker 1>a very bad illness is that not only does</v>
<v Speaker 1>it do you in,</v>

1106
00:47:14.611 --> 00:47:17.610
<v Speaker 1>but you can see it taking its toll on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the people around you.</v>

1107
00:47:17.611 --> 00:47:19.410
<v Speaker 1>I think that might even be worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1108
00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:22.500
<v Speaker 1>this is gradations of hell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still,</v>

1109
00:47:22.501 --> 00:47:25.440
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you also can't allow that to happen.</v>

1110
00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:28.020
<v Speaker 1>If you have a loved person around you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're ill,</v>

1111
00:47:28.021 --> 00:47:32.650
<v Speaker 1>you have a moral not to let it tear you </v>
<v Speaker 1>down because then it's on them.</v>

1112
00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:34.040
<v Speaker 1>That's no good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1113
00:47:34.090 --> 00:47:34.601
<v Speaker 1>And you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1114
00:47:34.601 --> 00:47:35.434
<v Speaker 1>how can you remain healthy and strong in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the face of the terrible suffering of </v>

1115
00:47:38.141 --> 00:47:39.190
<v Speaker 1>someone who's close to you?</v>

1116
00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:41.040
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that,</v>

1117
00:47:41.410 --> 00:47:43.720
<v Speaker 1>well that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The alternative is worse.</v>

1118
00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:44.583
<v Speaker 1>You want me to get sick and get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>weighed and not be able to take care of </v>

1119
00:47:46.691 --> 00:47:47.440
<v Speaker 1>you or me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1120
00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:49.660
<v Speaker 1>And then we didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we both drown faster.</v>

1121
00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:51.340
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Helpful.</v>

1122
00:47:51.490 --> 00:47:53.650
<v Speaker 1>What about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did she ever go through a place over,</v>

1123
00:47:53.651 --> 00:47:54.484
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess some people do this where you </v>

1124
00:47:56.441 --> 00:47:58.420
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids who have some type of autoimmune or</v>

1125
00:47:58.421 --> 00:48:00.310
<v Speaker 1>some type of disease or whatever it may </v>
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

1126
00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:02.380
<v Speaker 1>they didn't necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1127
00:48:02.381 --> 00:48:04.300
<v Speaker 1>they were born with it or aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening somehow.</v>

1128
00:48:04.301 --> 00:48:07.030
<v Speaker 1>It's not like they ate something </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

1129
00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:09.290
<v Speaker 1>They weren't necessarily the responsible</v>
<v Speaker 1>to say,</v>

1130
00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:10.153
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1131
00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:13.030
<v Speaker 1>was she responsible for causing all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

1132
00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:14.193
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the pain in her body or was it just </v>

1133
00:48:15.911 --> 00:48:16.744
<v Speaker 1>something that happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what we told her is just what </v>

1134
00:48:18.671 --> 00:48:19.900
<v Speaker 1>this life kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot.</v>

1135
00:48:19.901 --> 00:48:20.734
<v Speaker 1>It's not you.</v>

1136
00:48:20.950 --> 00:48:22.780
<v Speaker 1>We also told her very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very many,</v>

1137
00:48:22.781 --> 00:48:25.420
<v Speaker 1>many times and we were very careful </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this.</v>

1138
00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:29.740
<v Speaker 1>Do not use your illness as an excuse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as you do that,</v>

1139
00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:32.950
<v Speaker 1>you can't tell the difference between </v>
<v Speaker 1>the illness and your character.</v>

1140
00:48:33.540 --> 00:48:35.890
<v Speaker 1>It's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So don't let it turn you into a victim.</v>

1141
00:48:36.460 --> 00:48:38.920
<v Speaker 1>Even though it's obviously it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe.</v>

1142
00:48:38.921 --> 00:48:41.770
<v Speaker 1>Like we were very clear about that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't her fault,</v>

1143
00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:42.933
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that she still had to bear up under </v>

1144
00:48:45.281 --> 00:48:46.114
<v Speaker 1>it as well as possible and to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything she could and not use it as </v>

1145
00:48:49.691 --> 00:48:50.524
<v Speaker 1>an excuse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we talked to her about that a lot </v>

1146
00:48:52.031 --> 00:48:53.890
<v Speaker 1>and we're clear about it because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've seen,</v>

1147
00:48:53.891 --> 00:48:54.724
<v Speaker 1>this is one of the things I really </v>
<v Speaker 1>dislike about what the universities are </v>

1148
00:48:56.981 --> 00:49:00.040
<v Speaker 1>doing with disability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like everybody gets a disability.</v>

1149
00:49:00.670 --> 00:49:03.280
<v Speaker 1>It's like well no wonder because people </v>
<v Speaker 1>have hard lives.</v>

1150
00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:04.113
<v Speaker 1>You know it's like it's very rare to </v>
<v Speaker 1>find someone who isn't suffering under </v>

1151
00:49:08.921 --> 00:49:12.090
<v Speaker 1>an undue load of some sort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something wrong with them</v>

1152
00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:14.553
<v Speaker 1>or there's something wrong in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>family that serious or they have </v>

1153
00:49:16.901 --> 00:49:19.600
<v Speaker 1>terrible economic pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's something wrong.</v>

1154
00:49:19.810 --> 00:49:21.760
<v Speaker 1>It's like okay we should make allowances</v>
<v Speaker 1>for you.</v>

1155
00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:22.713
<v Speaker 1>It's like Oh yeah what allowances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What exactly does that entitle me to </v>

1156
00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:29.410
<v Speaker 1>while I tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man that's a murky place you do not want</v>

1157
00:49:29.411 --> 00:49:31.600
<v Speaker 1>to go because then you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

1158
00:49:31.810 --> 00:49:35.470
<v Speaker 1>It's like well what's my responsibility?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I have this undue burden to bear.</v>

1159
00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:37.690
<v Speaker 1>Well how does that mitigate my </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility?</v>

1160
00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:40.810
<v Speaker 1>Well the answer is as little as </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

1161
00:49:41.110 --> 00:49:43.860
<v Speaker 1>You don't go there cause you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>confused and,</v>

1162
00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:44.793
<v Speaker 1>and as soon as you get confused,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then the illness is not only got </v>

1163
00:49:46.991 --> 00:49:47.824
<v Speaker 1>you physiologically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got your psychologically and then </v>

1164
00:49:49.511 --> 00:49:50.440
<v Speaker 1>you're in deep trouble.</v>

1165
00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:51.633
<v Speaker 1>And so we were also very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very key and to her great credit as far </v>

1166
00:49:54.731 --> 00:49:55.564
<v Speaker 1>as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I wouldn't say she never used her </v>

1167
00:49:59.951 --> 00:50:02.860
<v Speaker 1>illness as an excuse because never is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot,</v>

1168
00:50:02.890 --> 00:50:04.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or never is an extreme.</v>

1169
00:50:05.350 --> 00:50:06.183
<v Speaker 1>But she certainly was stood the </v>
<v Speaker 1>temptation to do it habitually and to </v>

1170
00:50:11.651 --> 00:50:12.484
<v Speaker 1>warp per character as a consequence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she did figure out what was wrong </v>

1171
00:50:14.981 --> 00:50:15.814
<v Speaker 1>with her and fixed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so now she doesn't have any of </v>

1172
00:50:17.891 --> 00:50:18.724
<v Speaker 1>these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's healthy now while she still has </v>

1173
00:50:20.441 --> 00:50:22.810
<v Speaker 1>some residual damage from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from everything that happened.</v>

1174
00:50:22.811 --> 00:50:23.644
<v Speaker 1>Like I just found out yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she went to Chicago to have her ankle </v>

1175
00:50:26.231 --> 00:50:27.860
<v Speaker 1>checked out because it isn't working </v>
<v Speaker 1>very well.</v>

1176
00:50:27.861 --> 00:50:28.694
<v Speaker 1>And they told her that she had to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>the old replacement taken out and a new </v>

1177
00:50:31.341 --> 00:50:32.870
<v Speaker 1>one put in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1178
00:50:32.871 --> 00:50:35.510
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in her realm of catastrophe,</v>

1179
00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:38.600
<v Speaker 1>that actually constitutes not news.</v>

1180
00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:40.950
<v Speaker 1>That's not as bad as it could be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1181
00:50:40.970 --> 00:50:43.940
<v Speaker 1>strangely enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like she's out of the woods.</v>

1182
00:50:43.941 --> 00:50:46.770
<v Speaker 1>But you taught her from an early age </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'm sorry to cut you off.</v>

1183
00:50:46.771 --> 00:50:46.960
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1184
00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:49.010
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That even though she had a,</v>

1185
00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:49.873
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just for this state of the </v>

1186
00:50:52.250 --> 00:50:54.320
<v Speaker 1>conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a physical disability,</v>

1187
00:50:54.530 --> 00:50:55.363
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She wasn't as able bodied physically as </v>

1188
00:50:57.651 --> 00:50:59.870
<v Speaker 1>the majority of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that clear to say,</v>

1189
00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:01.303
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you told her like never allow that </v>

1190
00:51:02.901 --> 00:51:04.880
<v Speaker 1>to give you special privilege?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1191
00:51:04.881 --> 00:51:06.470
<v Speaker 1>never allow that to be never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1192
00:51:06.471 --> 00:51:07.304
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't that exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was never used that as an excuse to </v>

1193
00:51:10.011 --> 00:51:13.300
<v Speaker 1>not do something you could do even </v>
<v Speaker 1>without the thing.</v>

1194
00:51:13.460 --> 00:51:14.570
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's the,</v>

1195
00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:16.670
<v Speaker 1>there's a deception element there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1196
00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:17.743
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do that and I have this </v>

1197
00:51:19.761 --> 00:51:22.260
<v Speaker 1>illness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

1198
00:51:22.270 --> 00:51:23.103
<v Speaker 1>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't use your illness as a means of </v>

1199
00:51:24.531 --> 00:51:26.990
<v Speaker 1>getting away with something because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>blur the line.</v>

1200
00:51:27.580 --> 00:51:29.750
<v Speaker 1>Constantly use that rest of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1201
00:51:29.751 --> 00:51:30.584
<v Speaker 1>And if you do that a hundred times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll be so confused about what's </v>

1202
00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:36.590
<v Speaker 1>illness and what's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what's not that you'll not know.</v>

1203
00:51:36.620 --> 00:51:38.840
<v Speaker 1>You won't know anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe you won't be able to figure it</v>

1204
00:51:38.841 --> 00:51:41.210
<v Speaker 1>out again and then you're in a very bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

1205
00:51:41.570 --> 00:51:42.403
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was some things that she had to </v>

1206
00:51:43.491 --> 00:51:47.540
<v Speaker 1>have done that were allowances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when she was doing exams,</v>

1207
00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:50.690
<v Speaker 1>she had to type because she couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>write her writing,</v>

1208
00:51:50.691 --> 00:51:52.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she couldn't sit on the floor,</v>

1209
00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:54.680
<v Speaker 1>cross legged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she had to sit in a chair,</v>

1210
00:51:54.681 --> 00:51:56.600
<v Speaker 1>like things that she actually couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

1211
00:51:56.630 --> 00:51:58.550
<v Speaker 1>but she still didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1212
00:51:58.551 --> 00:51:59.860
<v Speaker 1>She did everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>

1213
00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:01.010
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't take the task.</v>

1214
00:52:01.130 --> 00:52:03.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't do the exam at all.</v>

1215
00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:05.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But she was able to do it with different</v>

1216
00:52:05.481 --> 00:52:06.440
<v Speaker 1>circumstance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1217
00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:07.220
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1218
00:52:07.220 --> 00:52:08.051
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1219
00:52:08.051 --> 00:52:10.400
<v Speaker 1>and the consequence of that was that </v>
<v Speaker 1>once she,</v>

1220
00:52:10.730 --> 00:52:13.160
<v Speaker 1>she figured out that most of what was </v>
<v Speaker 1>causing her,</v>

1221
00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:14.420
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was bothering her,</v>

1222
00:52:14.421 --> 00:52:16.730
<v Speaker 1>all of it by the looks of it was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of it,</v>

1223
00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:20.390
<v Speaker 1>a set of extreme sensitivities to almost</v>
<v Speaker 1>every sort of food.</v>

1224
00:52:20.810 --> 00:52:24.110
<v Speaker 1>So she hardly eats anything now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the only thing she eats his beef,</v>

1225
00:52:24.170 --> 00:52:25.300
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beef,</v>

1226
00:52:25.340 --> 00:52:26.480
<v Speaker 1>salt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>

1227
00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:28.070
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing else.</v>

1228
00:52:28.071 --> 00:52:28.800
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1229
00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:30.820
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she's been eating that way for,</v>

1230
00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:32.990
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly for about three years,</v>

1231
00:52:32.991 --> 00:52:35.540
<v Speaker 1>but almost completely for a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she feels fine.</v>

1232
00:52:35.630 --> 00:52:38.510
<v Speaker 1>She's 100% she has no symptoms and no </v>
<v Speaker 1>vegetables,</v>

1233
00:52:38.511 --> 00:52:39.830
<v Speaker 1>no supplements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

1234
00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:40.940
<v Speaker 1>Beef,</v>
<v Speaker 1>salt.</v>

1235
00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:43.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm serious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause you never cheats.</v>

1236
00:52:43.090 --> 00:52:43.923
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never because she doesn't want to feel </v>

1237
00:52:44.781 --> 00:52:45.740
<v Speaker 1>pain and suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1238
00:52:45.741 --> 00:52:48.020
<v Speaker 1>Well it takes it if she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if she eats the wrong thing,</v>

1239
00:52:48.021 --> 00:52:48.854
<v Speaker 1>she has a terrible catastrophic </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional and physical reactions for a </v>

1240
00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:53.450
<v Speaker 1>month.</v>

1241
00:52:53.450 --> 00:52:54.283
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She essentially eliminate all food and </v>

1242
00:52:55.521 --> 00:52:58.040
<v Speaker 1>try one thing at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's going to work.</v>

1243
00:52:58.041 --> 00:52:58.874
<v Speaker 1>Let's do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it took about three years to figure </v>

1244
00:52:59.961 --> 00:53:01.610
<v Speaker 1>it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yes,</v>

1245
00:53:01.611 --> 00:53:02.810
<v Speaker 1>while I was right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

1246
00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:06.500
<v Speaker 1>it's absolutely beyond comprehension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a diet that I follow almost,</v>

1247
00:53:06.740 --> 00:53:08.360
<v Speaker 1>almost entirely now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beef,</v>

1248
00:53:08.580 --> 00:53:09.580
<v Speaker 1>salted water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1249
00:53:09.770 --> 00:53:10.603
<v Speaker 1>I'd been eating that way for about three</v>
<v Speaker 1>months and I'd been on an extremely low </v>

1250
00:53:12.921 --> 00:53:15.710
<v Speaker 1>carb diet for about two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two and a half years.</v>

1251
00:53:15.711 --> 00:53:16.970
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1252
00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:17.833
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I,</v>

1253
00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:18.673
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both my wife and I have autoimmune </v>

1254
00:53:19.581 --> 00:53:22.710
<v Speaker 1>symptoms and she got all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your daughter.</v>

1255
00:53:22.711 --> 00:53:25.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she got [inaudible] by a thousand.</v>

1256
00:53:25.951 --> 00:53:26.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

1257
00:53:26.791 --> 00:53:29.430
<v Speaker 1>So and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when she sorted out what was wrong,</v>

1258
00:53:29.431 --> 00:53:30.264
<v Speaker 1>she convinced me to also try what she </v>
<v Speaker 1>was doing and it's been extraordinarily </v>

1259
00:53:33.211 --> 00:53:34.150
<v Speaker 1>help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really need to.</v>

1260
00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:36.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know who would,</v>

1261
00:53:36.810 --> 00:53:37.680
<v Speaker 1>who would have guessed it?</v>

1262
00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:39.370
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what you do when,</v>

1263
00:53:39.390 --> 00:53:43.290
<v Speaker 1>when things are too much for you as you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you narrow your timeframe.</v>

1264
00:53:43.950 --> 00:53:47.310
<v Speaker 1>I also an enrolled in chapter 12 you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know what?</v>

1265
00:53:47.490 --> 00:53:48.323
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a fair bit of discussion in </v>

1266
00:53:49.411 --> 00:53:50.244
<v Speaker 1>there about fragility and vulnerability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really what you confront when </v>

1267
00:53:53.011 --> 00:53:54.330
<v Speaker 1>you have a sick kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1268
00:53:54.331 --> 00:53:57.270
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can the world be constituted so that</v>

1269
00:53:57.480 --> 00:54:00.060
<v Speaker 1>a child can unfairly suffer in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>manner?</v>

1270
00:54:00.330 --> 00:54:01.163
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1271
00:54:01.350 --> 00:54:03.180
<v Speaker 1>here's a way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>

1272
00:54:03.181 --> 00:54:05.760
<v Speaker 1>Take away everything from your child </v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes them vulnerable.</v>

1273
00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:08.400
<v Speaker 1>Let's say I have a three year old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1274
00:54:08.430 --> 00:54:09.061
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three year olds,</v>

1275
00:54:09.061 --> 00:54:10.640
<v Speaker 1>they're kind of cute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They run around there,</v>

1276
00:54:10.690 --> 00:54:13.560
<v Speaker 1>they're little in there and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable obviously.</v>

1277
00:54:13.830 --> 00:54:15.810
<v Speaker 1>But that makes them cute and attractive </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1278
00:54:15.811 --> 00:54:16.710
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1279
00:54:16.830 --> 00:54:17.663
<v Speaker 1>and lovable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of the vulnerability that's built </v>

1280
00:54:19.351 --> 00:54:20.250
<v Speaker 1>into that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you think,</v>

1281
00:54:20.251 --> 00:54:21.084
<v Speaker 1>well you move,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remove that one by one while they're </v>

1282
00:54:22.201 --> 00:54:23.034
<v Speaker 1>eight foot tall now and they're made out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of steel and there are parts of </v>

1283
00:54:25.291 --> 00:54:26.124
<v Speaker 1>replaceable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have artificially intelligent </v>

1284
00:54:27.301 --> 00:54:28.890
<v Speaker 1>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you replace them.</v>

1285
00:54:29.130 --> 00:54:29.963
<v Speaker 1>Obviously this is hypothetical with a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a superhuman robot that doesn't </v>

1286
00:54:33.601 --> 00:54:35.270
<v Speaker 1>die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like fine,</v>

1287
00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:38.280
<v Speaker 1>but where's the three year old?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1288
00:54:38.430 --> 00:54:41.130
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things I thought about </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was writing this was,</v>

1289
00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:42.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you love someone,</v>

1290
00:54:42.871 --> 00:54:44.550
<v Speaker 1>especially what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you love someone,</v>

1291
00:54:44.970 --> 00:54:49.740
<v Speaker 1>you love them not only despite their </v>
<v Speaker 1>fragility but also because of it.</v>

1292
00:54:50.490 --> 00:54:52.440
<v Speaker 1>And so then that's the price he paid for</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1293
00:54:52.441 --> 00:54:54.030
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you wouldn't,</v>

1294
00:54:54.100 --> 00:54:55.710
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't be who they were if they </v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't,</v>

1295
00:54:56.790 --> 00:54:57.623
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't be who they were if they </v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't fragile and limited in their </v>

1296
00:55:01.111 --> 00:55:01.944
<v Speaker 1>particular way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the fact he liked to have them </v>

1297
00:55:03.841 --> 00:55:04.501
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Think,</v>

1298
00:55:04.501 --> 00:55:05.640
<v Speaker 1>oh well that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that gets,</v>

1299
00:55:05.641 --> 00:55:08.790
<v Speaker 1>you think that that fragility and </v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability is justifiable.</v>

1300
00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:11.640
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then you can't allow that.</v>

1301
00:55:11.850 --> 00:55:12.683
<v Speaker 1>It's re it's its existence to make you </v>
<v Speaker 1>bitter because he can't have it both </v>

1302
00:55:15.391 --> 00:55:15.990
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>

1303
00:55:15.990 --> 00:55:18.910
<v Speaker 1>You can't have them being vulnerable and</v>
<v Speaker 1>cute and,</v>

1304
00:55:19.260 --> 00:55:21.520
<v Speaker 1>and interesting and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and small and,</v>

1305
00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:22.950
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and needing care.</v>

1306
00:55:22.951 --> 00:55:24.360
<v Speaker 1>But striving to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1307
00:55:24.440 --> 00:55:28.920
<v Speaker 1>to develop and grow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't have that without the mall.</v>

1308
00:55:28.921 --> 00:55:33.150
<v Speaker 1>So being prone to pain and destruction </v>
<v Speaker 1>and vulnerability and so yeah,</v>

1309
00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:37.170
<v Speaker 1>take your choice then what do you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Teach them to be strong.</v>

1310
00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:39.720
<v Speaker 1>That's what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't get rid of the vulnerability.</v>

1311
00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:41.890
<v Speaker 1>You teach them to be strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1312
00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:43.750
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's that.</v>

1313
00:55:43.770 --> 00:55:46.260
<v Speaker 1>That's also a theme that runs through </v>
<v Speaker 1>the book and in many,</v>

1314
00:55:46.261 --> 00:55:48.690
<v Speaker 1>many ways is that you don't protect your</v>
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>

1315
00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:50.213
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do,</v>

1316
00:55:50.220 --> 00:55:51.053
<v Speaker 1>you do the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You expose them to the world as much as </v>

1317
00:55:52.681 --> 00:55:54.930
<v Speaker 1>you possibly can and you make them </v>
<v Speaker 1>strong.</v>

1318
00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:57.270
<v Speaker 1>That's the best antidote to their </v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability,</v>

1319
00:55:57.450 --> 00:56:00.240
<v Speaker 1>not to protect them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no protecting people.</v>

1320
00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:03.150
<v Speaker 1>We already established that life's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fatal game.</v>

1321
00:56:03.630 --> 00:56:04.463
<v Speaker 1>There's no protecting people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can definitely make them strong </v>

1322
00:56:07.590 --> 00:56:10.110
<v Speaker 1>and maybe you can make them strong </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to transcend that.</v>

1323
00:56:10.420 --> 00:56:11.520
<v Speaker 1>That's the goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1324
00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:13.073
<v Speaker 1>So is there anything that you wish you </v>
<v Speaker 1>would've done differently with your </v>

1325
00:56:15.571 --> 00:56:20.571
<v Speaker 1>daughter or your son that you didn't do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not not have any grip.</v>

1326
00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:28.690
<v Speaker 1>Not of any great significance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I have,</v>

1327
00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:30.393
<v Speaker 1>I have wishes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose from time to time that things </v>

1328
00:56:32.021 --> 00:56:33.070
<v Speaker 1>could have been different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1329
00:56:33.570 --> 00:56:34.403
<v Speaker 1>I spent less time on the positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspects of my son and my daughter </v>

1330
00:56:40.180 --> 00:56:44.500
<v Speaker 1>because we were contending with </v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe so frequently.</v>

1331
00:56:44.770 --> 00:56:45.431
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1332
00:56:45.431 --> 00:56:46.264
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both my kids have a variety of </v>

1333
00:56:47.530 --> 00:56:50.130
<v Speaker 1>interesting talents and it would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been</v>

1334
00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:56.150
<v Speaker 1>better perhaps to have had the time to </v>
<v Speaker 1>develop those more thoroughly.</v>

1335
00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:57.680
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when my son,</v>

1336
00:56:58.970 --> 00:56:59.803
<v Speaker 1>well he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say he didn't get as much </v>

1337
00:57:02.151 --> 00:57:02.984
<v Speaker 1>attention as he needed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't get as much attention as I </v>

1338
00:57:05.211 --> 00:57:10.211
<v Speaker 1>would have liked to have paid him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But by the same token,</v>

1339
00:57:10.371 --> 00:57:11.204
<v Speaker 1>and it isn't obvious that it's been bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>for it because it required him from a </v>

1340
00:57:14.121 --> 00:57:18.470
<v Speaker 1>very early age to grow the hell up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we relied on him right from the time</v>

1341
00:57:18.471 --> 00:57:20.510
<v Speaker 1>he was a young kid to make intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions.</v>

1342
00:57:20.511 --> 00:57:22.310
<v Speaker 1>We assumed he would make intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions.</v>

1343
00:57:22.311 --> 00:57:25.550
<v Speaker 1>He was consulted with regards to </v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions and so,</v>

1344
00:57:26.970 --> 00:57:28.610
<v Speaker 1>and it also made them into someone who </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

1345
00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:32.300
<v Speaker 1>who is very self sufficient and capable </v>
<v Speaker 1>of taking care of himself.</v>

1346
00:57:32.360 --> 00:57:33.193
<v Speaker 1>So it might've been nicer for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose to have spent more time with </v>

1347
00:57:37.461 --> 00:57:38.294
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1348
00:57:38.300 --> 00:57:39.230
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1349
00:57:39.940 --> 00:57:43.160
<v Speaker 1>but he lives down the street from me now</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I spend time with them and we have a</v>

1350
00:57:43.161 --> 00:57:45.020
<v Speaker 1>great relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's just,</v>

1351
00:57:45.080 --> 00:57:45.920
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1352
00:57:46.180 --> 00:57:49.810
<v Speaker 1>and as he has a very good relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>with his sister and uh,</v>

1353
00:57:51.410 --> 00:57:53.270
<v Speaker 1>so it turned out as well as it could </v>
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

1354
00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:54.770
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1355
00:57:54.830 --> 00:57:57.710
<v Speaker 1>but that didn't mean that those years in</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

1356
00:57:57.890 --> 00:57:59.960
<v Speaker 1>they were brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was some brutal times.</v>

1357
00:57:59.961 --> 00:58:00.794
<v Speaker 1>Man is one night in particular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like she was in absolutely a absolute </v>

1358
00:58:03.411 --> 00:58:06.140
<v Speaker 1>agony and I couldn't get it under </v>
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>

1359
00:58:06.230 --> 00:58:07.370
<v Speaker 1>And I could see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1360
00:58:07.371 --> 00:58:09.380
<v Speaker 1>because I am a clinician,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could see,</v>

1361
00:58:09.381 --> 00:58:10.340
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God dammit,</v>

1362
00:58:10.550 --> 00:58:11.383
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to end it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>end up taking her to Cam h as the </v>

1363
00:58:13.641 --> 00:58:16.010
<v Speaker 1>psychiatric hospital because it looks </v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's going to break out.</v>

1364
00:58:16.080 --> 00:58:16.730
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1365
00:58:16.730 --> 00:58:20.000
<v Speaker 1>goddammit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't see a way to resolve it,</v>

1366
00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:22.640
<v Speaker 1>but it pushed her right to the brink,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1367
00:58:23.060 --> 00:58:24.980
<v Speaker 1>but not over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1368
00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:28.490
<v Speaker 1>and there was another episode after,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after she had her hip removed,</v>

1369
00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:29.900
<v Speaker 1>hip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hip replaced.</v>

1370
00:58:30.230 --> 00:58:31.063
<v Speaker 1>She was put in a rehab home hospital for</v>
<v Speaker 1>awhile and she was the youngest person </v>

1371
00:58:34.371 --> 00:58:35.780
<v Speaker 1>in it by like 60 years.</v>

1372
00:58:35.900 --> 00:58:39.200
<v Speaker 1>And they treated her terribly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a terrible place,</v>

1373
00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:43.940
<v Speaker 1>mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean blind nurses and very,</v>

1374
00:58:43.970 --> 00:58:47.270
<v Speaker 1>very badly run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they traumatized her hospital.</v>

1375
00:58:47.271 --> 00:58:49.280
<v Speaker 1>It was a worse experience than the damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>surgery.</v>

1376
00:58:49.730 --> 00:58:50.930
<v Speaker 1>And so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>

1377
00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:52.730
<v Speaker 1>that took her quite a while to recover </v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

1378
00:58:52.731 --> 00:58:55.760
<v Speaker 1>but she did recover from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever think now,</v>

1379
00:58:55.970 --> 00:58:57.590
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1380
00:58:57.710 --> 00:58:58.543
<v Speaker 1>since you're a clinical kind of clinical</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologist and you've done all this </v>

1381
00:59:01.431 --> 00:59:02.264
<v Speaker 1>research and work and studies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you believe that your daughter was </v>

1382
00:59:05.751 --> 00:59:10.751
<v Speaker 1>meant to experience this for you to kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of test your ability to be with her?</v>

1383
00:59:12.411 --> 00:59:15.620
<v Speaker 1>And do you think she would have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to grow and the way she is now with</v>

1384
00:59:15.621 --> 00:59:18.050
<v Speaker 1>someone who didn't have the practice </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you had?</v>

1385
00:59:18.410 --> 00:59:19.243
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was fortunate for all of us </v>

1386
00:59:20.601 --> 00:59:21.231
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1387
00:59:21.231 --> 00:59:24.540
<v Speaker 1>my wife too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my wife had worked in palliative care as</v>

1388
00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:27.640
<v Speaker 1>a volunteer and she was a massage </v>
<v Speaker 1>therapist for a long time.</v>

1389
00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:30.470
<v Speaker 1>She's very good at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and my wife has a real,</v>

1390
00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:35.060
<v Speaker 1>she's a really tough person and if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't need help and you want it,</v>

1391
00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:38.240
<v Speaker 1>she'll cut you into ribbons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you need help,</v>

1392
00:59:39.050 --> 00:59:39.883
<v Speaker 1>she will really help you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she's really good at differentiating </v>

1393
00:59:42.591 --> 00:59:43.424
<v Speaker 1>between people who actually need help,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in which case she is right there and </v>

1394
00:59:46.281 --> 00:59:47.114
<v Speaker 1>people who could stand up on their own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you can't stand up on your own </v>

1395
00:59:50.061 --> 00:59:52.940
<v Speaker 1>and you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you could stand up on your own end,</v>

1396
00:59:52.941 --> 00:59:53.774
<v Speaker 1>you aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to be around her because </v>

1397
00:59:55.371 --> 00:59:57.350
<v Speaker 1>she will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She will put you in your place.</v>

1398
00:59:57.710 --> 00:59:59.470
<v Speaker 1>And it was so funny because our kids </v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

1399
00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:00.473
<v Speaker 1>our kids used to bring their friends </v>
<v Speaker 1>over all the time when they were </v>

1400
01:00:02.211 --> 01:00:03.870
<v Speaker 1>teenagers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we actually quite light.</v>

1401
01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:06.500
<v Speaker 1>And what we had a rule for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>teenagers,</v>

1402
01:00:06.501 --> 01:00:08.750
<v Speaker 1>which was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're really happy you're here,</v>

1403
01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:12.170
<v Speaker 1>but if you do something stupid and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>never get to come back,</v>

1404
01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:13.760
<v Speaker 1>that's actually okay with us.</v>

1405
01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:16.760
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they knew that and it was no joke</v>

1406
01:00:16.761 --> 01:00:19.190
<v Speaker 1>because we were happy they were there </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were welcome.</v>

1407
01:00:19.310 --> 01:00:23.060
<v Speaker 1>But we were perfectly happy to dispense </v>
<v Speaker 1>with them if they misbehaved forever.</v>

1408
01:00:23.090 --> 01:00:23.923
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what was really funny was that the </v>

1409
01:00:25.371 --> 01:00:26.204
<v Speaker 1>kids would come over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the teenagers would come over and they </v>

1410
01:00:27.591 --> 01:00:28.424
<v Speaker 1>were pretty afraid of me to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But after being around for a couple of </v>

1411
01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:33.230
<v Speaker 1>weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were way more afraid of my wife.</v>

1412
01:00:33.670 --> 01:00:35.390
<v Speaker 1>So yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was very funny.</v>

1413
01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:36.291
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because she's,</v>

1414
01:00:36.291 --> 01:00:38.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's quite a pleasant person and she's,</v>

1415
01:00:38.151 --> 01:00:38.984
<v Speaker 1>she's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1416
01:00:39.260 --> 01:00:41.800
<v Speaker 1>she's only five foot two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she's about,</v>

1417
01:00:41.810 --> 01:00:42.740
<v Speaker 1>although she's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1418
01:00:42.741 --> 01:00:45.380
<v Speaker 1>she's imposing enough cause she's also </v>
<v Speaker 1>in good physical shape,</v>

1419
01:00:45.381 --> 01:00:49.520
<v Speaker 1>but it was because I'm actually kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>soft hearted and she's not softhearted,</v>

1420
01:00:49.610 --> 01:00:52.490
<v Speaker 1>although she can really take care of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who need to be taken care of.</v>

1421
01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:54.140
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1422
01:00:54.141 --> 01:00:55.670
<v Speaker 1>So I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1423
01:00:55.671 --> 01:00:56.504
<v Speaker 1>mckayla had a fortunate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fortunate circumstance in that sense </v>

1424
01:00:59.211 --> 01:01:03.260
<v Speaker 1>because both of us had a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience dealing with catastrophe.</v>

1425
01:01:03.261 --> 01:01:06.920
<v Speaker 1>And so when it came along we weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were overwhelmed by it,</v>

1426
01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:09.140
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't because we didn't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>what we were doing,</v>

1427
01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:10.880
<v Speaker 1>we knew what we were doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just,</v>

1428
01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:15.940
<v Speaker 1>even though we didn't know what we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing as much as might be possible,</v>

1429
01:01:17.630 --> 01:01:19.820
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean that we could deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it because it was,</v>

1430
01:01:19.821 --> 01:01:21.350
<v Speaker 1>well it took us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it took us one,</v>

1431
01:01:21.530 --> 01:01:22.363
<v Speaker 1>it must have been seven or eight months </v>
<v Speaker 1>to arrange the ankle surgery and there </v>

1432
01:01:25.971 --> 01:01:29.660
<v Speaker 1>was a waiting list in Canada at that </v>
<v Speaker 1>point of I think three years actually.</v>

1433
01:01:29.661 --> 01:01:30.494
<v Speaker 1>They wanted to fuse her foot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really bad thing for someone </v>

1434
01:01:32.961 --> 01:01:35.300
<v Speaker 1>young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we looked in India,</v>

1435
01:01:35.301 --> 01:01:36.134
<v Speaker 1>we looked in all Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we looked all over the world for ankle </v>

1436
01:01:38.121 --> 01:01:39.680
<v Speaker 1>surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like really everywhere.</v>

1437
01:01:39.950 --> 01:01:43.190
<v Speaker 1>And finally the government in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was actually quite helpful.</v>

1438
01:01:43.191 --> 01:01:47.480
<v Speaker 1>We found a private clinic in Vancouver </v>
<v Speaker 1>that did the surgery and the,</v>

1439
01:01:47.530 --> 01:01:48.220
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1440
01:01:48.220 --> 01:01:49.053
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Ministry of Health in Ontario was </v>

1441
01:01:50.121 --> 01:01:53.480
<v Speaker 1>quite helpful to us at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we were scrambling to,</v>

1442
01:01:53.630 --> 01:01:54.530
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1443
01:01:55.070 --> 01:01:57.560
<v Speaker 1>what should we do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should we have her ankle replacement?</v>

1444
01:01:57.561 --> 01:01:59.370
<v Speaker 1>What sort of replacement?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who did we talk to?</v>

1445
01:01:59.410 --> 01:02:00.620
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about this waiting list?</v>

1446
01:02:00.621 --> 01:02:01.730
<v Speaker 1>Three years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1447
01:02:01.731 --> 01:02:02.630
<v Speaker 1>no way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit,</v>

1448
01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:05.580
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she can't live for three a week.</v>

1449
01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:07.790
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's three.</v>

1450
01:02:07.791 --> 01:02:09.140
<v Speaker 1>Here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was just beyond,</v>

1451
01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:10.033
<v Speaker 1>did you ever doubt yourself in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your ability and your research and your </v>

1452
01:02:13.821 --> 01:02:16.220
<v Speaker 1>studies?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever say to yourself like,</v>

1453
01:02:16.490 --> 01:02:17.420
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I can,</v>

1454
01:02:17.870 --> 01:02:18.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure this out,</v>

1455
01:02:18.930 --> 01:02:21.450
<v Speaker 1>then all of my work is for nothing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1456
01:02:21.451 --> 01:02:23.100
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never thought it was for nothing,</v>

1457
01:02:23.101 --> 01:02:23.934
<v Speaker 1>but I certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I certainly doubted whether or not we </v>

1458
01:02:27.631 --> 01:02:29.850
<v Speaker 1>were going to be able to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure this out.</v>

1459
01:02:30.110 --> 01:02:32.290
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you thought it,</v>

1460
01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:34.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and at that time you're extremely,</v>

1461
01:02:34.261 --> 01:02:37.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>educated research,</v>

1462
01:02:37.051 --> 01:02:38.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd see a lot.</v>

1463
01:02:38.580 --> 01:02:40.680
<v Speaker 1>Did you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did that give you a fear of like,</v>

1464
01:02:40.681 --> 01:02:42.000
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I can't figure this out,</v>

1465
01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:43.440
<v Speaker 1>then no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of course,</v>

1466
01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:44.410
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well her,</v>

1467
01:02:44.411 --> 01:02:48.270
<v Speaker 1>her prognosis was multiple early joint </v>
<v Speaker 1>replacements and that was like,</v>

1468
01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:50.730
<v Speaker 1>that was the good news because the bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>news is,</v>

1469
01:02:50.731 --> 01:02:55.731
<v Speaker 1>well how many and how many can you stand</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when does that kill you?</v>

1470
01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:56.731
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1471
01:02:56.731 --> 01:03:01.560
<v Speaker 1>so her real prognosis was plenty of pain</v>
<v Speaker 1>with an early death,</v>

1472
01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:03.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because well even now,</v>

1473
01:03:03.991 --> 01:03:04.890
<v Speaker 1>even now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1474
01:03:04.891 --> 01:03:07.590
<v Speaker 1>like the surgeon who talked to her </v>
<v Speaker 1>yesterday said,</v>

1475
01:03:07.591 --> 01:03:11.220
<v Speaker 1>well because he talked to her about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>risk of amputation in the future.</v>

1476
01:03:11.221 --> 01:03:13.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well this is the second joint revision.</v>

1477
01:03:13.290 --> 01:03:15.120
<v Speaker 1>It's like maybe this would last 15 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

1478
01:03:15.121 --> 01:03:16.470
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what the hell is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

1479
01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:17.313
<v Speaker 1>You well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so our response to that is that's 15 </v>

1480
01:03:19.951 --> 01:03:21.090
<v Speaker 1>years from now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1481
01:03:21.150 --> 01:03:22.530
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1482
01:03:22.531 --> 01:03:27.531
<v Speaker 1>things are better now for how people </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand how to replace an ankle.</v>

1483
01:03:27.811 --> 01:03:30.480
<v Speaker 1>Then they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was 10 years ago that she had</v>

1484
01:03:30.481 --> 01:03:33.570
<v Speaker 1>this one replaced and it helped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't perfect.</v>

1485
01:03:33.690 --> 01:03:37.250
<v Speaker 1>Her hip is perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ankle has always been troubled,</v>

1486
01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:39.360
<v Speaker 1>but way less trouble than it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1487
01:03:39.810 --> 01:03:42.930
<v Speaker 1>well you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you struggle forward the best you can.</v>

1488
01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:46.500
<v Speaker 1>And so I suppose she could adapt to an </v>
<v Speaker 1>amputation if that was necessary.</v>

1489
01:03:46.501 --> 01:03:47.334
<v Speaker 1>But at the moment it isn't necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but multiple amputations is not </v>

1490
01:03:50.221 --> 01:03:53.160
<v Speaker 1>something to really be looking forward </v>
<v Speaker 1>to when you're 16 you know,</v>

1491
01:03:53.161 --> 01:03:55.620
<v Speaker 1>and they were going to put her on </v>
<v Speaker 1>corticosteroids to control her,</v>

1492
01:03:55.950 --> 01:03:57.440
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her inflammation,</v>

1493
01:03:57.441 --> 01:03:59.730
<v Speaker 1>and that would have produced cushing's </v>
<v Speaker 1>disease.</v>

1494
01:03:59.731 --> 01:04:02.160
<v Speaker 1>And so that makes your face all puffy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it makes you gain weight.</v>

1495
01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:02.993
<v Speaker 1>And so it's very physically disfiguring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we decided not to go down that route </v>

1496
01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:08.940
<v Speaker 1>and wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1497
01:04:08.941 --> 01:04:10.230
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1498
01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:11.730
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's worked out.</v>

1499
01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:12.653
<v Speaker 1>Thank God it's quite the miracle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she had a baby a year ago and we </v>

1500
01:04:14.851 --> 01:04:16.230
<v Speaker 1>were never sure that was going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

1501
01:04:16.231 --> 01:04:17.550
<v Speaker 1>So grads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

1502
01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:18.920
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

1503
01:04:18.930 --> 01:04:19.763
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now we have this respite where she's </v>

1504
01:04:22.021 --> 01:04:26.460
<v Speaker 1>healthy and the last time I saw her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was looking great.</v>

1505
01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:29.070
<v Speaker 1>Like she just glowing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's so healthy.</v>

1506
01:04:29.130 --> 01:04:32.130
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just beyond belief.</v>

1507
01:04:32.510 --> 01:04:35.610
<v Speaker 1>And congrats on all the hard work you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>done to make a,</v>

1508
01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:38.140
<v Speaker 1>make it a possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1509
01:04:38.290 --> 01:04:42.210
<v Speaker 1>Well we avoided the worst excesses of </v>
<v Speaker 1>hell during the catastrophe.</v>

1510
01:04:42.211 --> 01:04:45.540
<v Speaker 1>So that's something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it did allow her the space to figure</v>

1511
01:04:45.541 --> 01:04:47.880
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my wife had always thought that diet</v>

1512
01:04:47.881 --> 01:04:50.790
<v Speaker 1>had a relationship to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we investigated that.</v>

1513
01:04:50.790 --> 01:04:54.120
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a good literature that </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows if you have arthritic symptoms and</v>

1514
01:04:54.121 --> 01:04:57.450
<v Speaker 1>you stop eating if you fast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go away.</v>

1515
01:04:58.330 --> 01:04:59.640
<v Speaker 1>So That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1516
01:04:59.641 --> 01:05:01.500
<v Speaker 1>well food must be causing it and see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1517
01:05:01.501 --> 01:05:04.380
<v Speaker 1>But once you start to eat again to </v>
<v Speaker 1>survive what you eat,</v>

1518
01:05:04.690 --> 01:05:06.840
<v Speaker 1>it comes back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It turns out no,</v>

1519
01:05:06.841 --> 01:05:10.320
<v Speaker 1>not no matter what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost no matter what.</v>

1520
01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:12.870
<v Speaker 1>Cause she sensitive to virtually </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>

1521
01:05:13.050 --> 01:05:13.883
<v Speaker 1>but she isn't sensitive to meet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it turns out that if you eat </v>

1522
01:05:17.381 --> 01:05:18.370
<v Speaker 1>meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can live.</v>

1523
01:05:18.390 --> 01:05:20.530
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a big difference between being</v>

1524
01:05:20.531 --> 01:05:24.190
<v Speaker 1>sensitive to everything and not being </v>
<v Speaker 1>sensitive to one thing.</v>

1525
01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:26.890
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>

1526
01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:29.530
<v Speaker 1>it's a harsh diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1527
01:05:30.370 --> 01:05:31.203
<v Speaker 1>it's made traveling difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I can eat in restaurants </v>

1528
01:05:33.431 --> 01:05:36.250
<v Speaker 1>because most restaurants can cook a </v>
<v Speaker 1>steak with nothing on it.</v>

1529
01:05:36.251 --> 01:05:38.890
<v Speaker 1>And that's made things much easier while</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm traveling,</v>

1530
01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:40.173
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

1531
01:05:40.910 --> 01:05:42.020
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

1532
01:05:42.021 --> 01:05:44.180
<v Speaker 1>it's working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so thank God for that.</v>

1533
01:05:44.181 --> 01:05:45.240
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

1534
01:05:45.350 --> 01:05:46.183
<v Speaker 1>Do you believe?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think hypothetically if your </v>

1535
01:05:49.371 --> 01:05:53.330
<v Speaker 1>daughter was healthy and never had any </v>
<v Speaker 1>of these complications that you would be</v>

1536
01:05:53.331 --> 01:05:57.050
<v Speaker 1>the man you are impacting people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the success,</v>

1537
01:05:57.051 --> 01:05:57.681
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1538
01:05:57.681 --> 01:06:00.350
<v Speaker 1>all the attention you'd be getting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think you'd have as much</v>

1539
01:06:01.890 --> 01:06:04.430
<v Speaker 1>written 12th chapter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

1540
01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:08.720
<v Speaker 1>Do you think in general you would still </v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to have the ideals,</v>

1541
01:06:08.721 --> 01:06:12.080
<v Speaker 1>the belief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 42 that you have to reach people and</v>

1542
01:06:12.081 --> 01:06:13.230
<v Speaker 1>really impact people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1543
01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:14.180
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so,</v>

1544
01:06:14.181 --> 01:06:15.290
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're,</v>

1545
01:06:15.291 --> 01:06:16.830
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know your,</v>

1546
01:06:16.831 --> 01:06:19.730
<v Speaker 1>your question as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To what degree is adversity,</v>

1547
01:06:19.731 --> 01:06:22.130
<v Speaker 1>character building,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the answer to that is plenty.</v>

1548
01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:24.440
<v Speaker 1>But I was already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

1549
01:06:24.441 --> 01:06:26.900
<v Speaker 1>it was the same with my wife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We weren't naive people.</v>

1550
01:06:26.901 --> 01:06:27.734
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I had an extensive clinical </v>

1551
01:06:29.511 --> 01:06:33.350
<v Speaker 1>practice I was dealing with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with heavy level adversity.</v>

1552
01:06:33.420 --> 01:06:36.610
<v Speaker 1>Oh 25 hours a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your daughter knows.</v>

1553
01:06:36.620 --> 01:06:37.730
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there were,</v>

1554
01:06:37.780 --> 01:06:38.613
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were other problems in my family </v>

1555
01:06:39.651 --> 01:06:42.980
<v Speaker 1>and so forth that I dealt with as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we were already,</v>

1556
01:06:43.370 --> 01:06:44.870
<v Speaker 1>we'd already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1557
01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:50.800
<v Speaker 1>garnered most of what we could from </v>
<v Speaker 1>confronting adverse situations,</v>

1558
01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:53.510
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1559
01:06:54.020 --> 01:06:56.420
<v Speaker 1>now did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did that add a different level to it?</v>

1560
01:06:59.750 --> 01:07:00.850
<v Speaker 4>It's fine.</v>

1561
01:07:04.410 --> 01:07:05.243
<v Speaker 1>It probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it probably fire tested our </v>

1562
01:07:07.921 --> 01:07:09.390
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our familiar,</v>

1563
01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:11.400
<v Speaker 1>it probably brought our family closer </v>
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>

1564
01:07:11.401 --> 01:07:12.234
<v Speaker 1>all things considered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw the same thing happened when my </v>

1565
01:07:14.161 --> 01:07:15.870
<v Speaker 1>wife's mother die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>died.</v>

1566
01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:19.040
<v Speaker 1>She died of a pre frontal dementia and </v>
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

1567
01:07:19.041 --> 01:07:19.874
<v Speaker 1>she developed it quite young about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>started to really manifest itself in </v>

1568
01:07:22.330 --> 01:07:26.250
<v Speaker 1>early fifties and she died when she was </v>
<v Speaker 1>70 and she fell apart over,</v>

1569
01:07:26.251 --> 01:07:27.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>18 years.</v>

1570
01:07:28.050 --> 01:07:30.540
<v Speaker 1>And she was very physically healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1571
01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:33.390
<v Speaker 1>and her husband,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was quite the man about town when he</v>

1572
01:07:33.391 --> 01:07:34.980
<v Speaker 1>was a young guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real extrovert,</v>

1573
01:07:34.981 --> 01:07:39.150
<v Speaker 1>he was a real character in our hometown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He took care of her so well.</v>

1574
01:07:39.151 --> 01:07:42.420
<v Speaker 1>It was absolutely jaw dropping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time she slipped,</v>

1575
01:07:42.421 --> 01:07:43.254
<v Speaker 1>he'd step up to the plate and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he took care of her until he couldn't </v>

1576
01:07:46.350 --> 01:07:49.350
<v Speaker 1>lift her out of her chair anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was getting old too.</v>

1577
01:07:49.650 --> 01:07:51.960
<v Speaker 1>And so she wasn't in an old age home for</v>
<v Speaker 1>very long.</v>

1578
01:07:52.290 --> 01:07:54.510
<v Speaker 1>And then we were around when she died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1579
01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:56.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the last couple of days,</v>

1580
01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:59.520
<v Speaker 1>just before her death and her family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>

1581
01:07:59.610 --> 01:08:02.760
<v Speaker 1>her sister is a palliative care nurse or</v>
<v Speaker 1>other sister's a pharmacist.</v>

1582
01:08:02.761 --> 01:08:05.400
<v Speaker 1>And tammy's had the experiences that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've already described.</v>

1583
01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.550
<v Speaker 1>And then her father really stepped up to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the plate.</v>

1584
01:08:08.551 --> 01:08:10.410
<v Speaker 1>And so the whole family gathered around </v>
<v Speaker 1>for that.</v>

1585
01:08:10.411 --> 01:08:13.590
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they acted impeccably throughout it.</v>

1586
01:08:13.591 --> 01:08:17.810
<v Speaker 1>I would say they took care of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother carefully while she was dying and</v>

1587
01:08:17.930 --> 01:08:20.450
<v Speaker 1>they pulled together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the consequences of that,</v>

1588
01:08:20.451 --> 01:08:21.284
<v Speaker 1>which was so interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that although their mother died and </v>

1589
01:08:23.481 --> 01:08:27.230
<v Speaker 1>that was a terrible loss there borns </v>
<v Speaker 1>that connected them,</v>

1590
01:08:27.410 --> 01:08:28.243
<v Speaker 1>all of them strengthened to the point </v>
<v Speaker 1>where I would say that was almost </v>

1591
01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:34.160
<v Speaker 1>compensation for the loss of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother.</v>

1592
01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:39.170
<v Speaker 1>So that was really interesting to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens even in a dire circumstance</v>

1593
01:08:39.171 --> 01:08:42.710
<v Speaker 1>if people do do what they can't.</v>

1594
01:08:42.710 --> 01:08:44.360
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that that's going to work</v>

1595
01:08:44.361 --> 01:08:45.194
<v Speaker 1>for every situation because I know </v>
<v Speaker 1>people get cut off at the knees and </v>

1596
01:08:47.061 --> 01:08:49.550
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you hate a tragedy that while </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fatal,</v>

1597
01:08:49.580 --> 01:08:51.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you cannot rectify.</v>

1598
01:08:52.010 --> 01:08:52.843
<v Speaker 1>It's a real catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was very interesting watching </v>

1599
01:08:54.981 --> 01:08:55.814
<v Speaker 1>that because they were alert and awake </v>
<v Speaker 1>around the deathbed and they weren't </v>

1600
01:08:59.121 --> 01:08:59.954
<v Speaker 1>fighting with each other at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no familial squabbling cause </v>

1601
01:09:03.401 --> 01:09:04.234
<v Speaker 1>you can imagine that that would happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>cause everyone's stressed and then you </v>

1602
01:09:07.851 --> 01:09:11.450
<v Speaker 1>can just imagine how terrible that would</v>
<v Speaker 1>make something that's already awful.</v>

1603
01:09:11.451 --> 01:09:14.210
<v Speaker 1>There was none of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They focus their attention on her,</v>

1604
01:09:14.380 --> 01:09:15.213
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they gave her water when she needed it </v>

1605
01:09:16.221 --> 01:09:19.520
<v Speaker 1>and they watched her and they made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they made this terrible thing,</v>

1606
01:09:19.521 --> 01:09:23.540
<v Speaker 1>the least amount of awful it could be </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it definitely pulled them together.</v>

1607
01:09:24.090 --> 01:09:24.923
<v Speaker 1>That whole family including me is closer</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of what they went through and </v>

1608
01:09:31.101 --> 01:09:33.770
<v Speaker 1>also how they went through it and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably the case.</v>

1609
01:09:35.150 --> 01:09:35.983
<v Speaker 1>Well I would say definitely advanced the</v>
<v Speaker 1>maturity of my son because he was cold </v>

1610
01:09:41.961 --> 01:09:42.681
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told him,</v>

1611
01:09:42.681 --> 01:09:47.030
<v Speaker 1>look kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you can't add anything to this.</v>

1612
01:09:47.570 --> 01:09:48.201
<v Speaker 1>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

1613
01:09:48.201 --> 01:09:49.034
<v Speaker 1>we're up to here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to conduct yourself properly </v>

1614
01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:54.470
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise everything's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>shake and fall.</v>

1615
01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:55.513
<v Speaker 1>We can't have more of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't bring any and anything </v>

1616
01:09:58.491 --> 01:10:00.830
<v Speaker 1>unnecessary into this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was an all star.</v>

1617
01:10:01.070 --> 01:10:02.810
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a remarkable man.</v>

1618
01:10:02.980 --> 01:10:03.813
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he who is only on grade 10 when </v>

1619
01:10:05.541 --> 01:10:06.374
<v Speaker 1>most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of this happened and your friends </v>

1620
01:10:07.251 --> 01:10:11.030
<v Speaker 1>are pretty damn important when you're in</v>
<v Speaker 1>grade 10 and he stuck around a lot to be</v>

1621
01:10:11.031 --> 01:10:12.440
<v Speaker 1>helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

1622
01:10:12.441 --> 01:10:14.720
<v Speaker 1>it was really good for him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1623
01:10:15.050 --> 01:10:15.591
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well he,</v>

1624
01:10:15.591 --> 01:10:16.820
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a good character.</v>

1625
01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:17.900
<v Speaker 1>He's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

1626
01:10:17.901 --> 01:10:20.840
<v Speaker 1>he's quite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite something and it was very helpful.</v>

1627
01:10:20.841 --> 01:10:23.870
<v Speaker 1>He was very helpful to his sister.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had their fights obviously.</v>

1628
01:10:23.870 --> 01:10:26.480
<v Speaker 1>Well and she was often unreasonable and </v>
<v Speaker 1>no bloody wonder,</v>

1629
01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:27.823
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well when you're strung out and you </v>

1630
01:10:29.490 --> 01:10:32.000
<v Speaker 1>can't feel anything but pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

1631
01:10:32.001 --> 01:10:32.834
<v Speaker 1>she went through so much like even </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching her withdraw from the opiates </v>

1632
01:10:35.211 --> 01:10:37.010
<v Speaker 1>cause she was on them for about a year </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a half.</v>

1633
01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:38.070
<v Speaker 1>She just quit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1634
01:10:38.090 --> 01:10:39.140
<v Speaker 1>they will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as she was done,</v>

1635
01:10:39.141 --> 01:10:41.060
<v Speaker 1>her surgeons like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not taking these anymore.</v>

1636
01:10:41.061 --> 01:10:41.894
<v Speaker 1>And she had formal medication,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the sensation of ants crawling </v>

1637
01:10:44.811 --> 01:10:47.780
<v Speaker 1>under your skin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had that for like a month and uh,</v>

1638
01:10:48.260 --> 01:10:49.850
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievable.</v>

1639
01:10:50.030 --> 01:10:51.320
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she just,</v>

1640
01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:54.590
<v Speaker 1>just sailed through it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I'm done with these.</v>

1641
01:10:55.110 --> 01:10:55.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1642
01:10:56.150 --> 01:10:57.810
<v Speaker 1>You guys have been through a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1643
01:10:57.811 --> 01:10:58.644
<v Speaker 1>That's your lot here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's your biggest fear now moving </v>

1644
01:11:01.221 --> 01:11:03.020
<v Speaker 1>forward in your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your own life?</v>

1645
01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:05.240
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making a mistake at the moment.</v>

1646
01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:06.193
<v Speaker 1>Cause like I'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd been the subject of so much public </v>

1647
01:11:08.541 --> 01:11:11.960
<v Speaker 1>attention in the last two years and like</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been in a situation where,</v>

1648
01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:13.333
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even things I didn't say have also </v>

1649
01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:18.120
<v Speaker 1>almost been fatal because people take </v>
<v Speaker 1>them out of context.</v>

1650
01:11:18.290 --> 01:11:18.891
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1651
01:11:18.891 --> 01:11:19.780
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1652
01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:20.993
<v Speaker 1>but I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my biggest fear has been that I do </v>

1653
01:11:24.241 --> 01:11:25.074
<v Speaker 1>something careless and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that there are like serious </v>

1654
01:11:30.961 --> 01:11:35.760
<v Speaker 1>cascading consequences to feel like </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've done something careless or well,</v>

1655
01:11:35.761 --> 01:11:37.570
<v Speaker 1>everyone's done something careless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1656
01:11:37.970 --> 01:11:39.540
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've been pretty careful.</v>

1657
01:11:39.541 --> 01:11:40.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was fortunate,</v>

1658
01:11:40.621 --> 01:11:43.800
<v Speaker 1>so when this political scandal blew up </v>
<v Speaker 1>around me and in Canada,</v>

1659
01:11:43.801 --> 01:11:47.310
<v Speaker 1>when I opposed some legislation that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought was reprehensible,</v>

1660
01:11:47.311 --> 01:11:49.170
<v Speaker 1>he constructed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1661
01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:50.241
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1662
01:11:50.241 --> 01:11:51.074
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the radicals on the left in particular </v>

1663
01:11:52.501 --> 01:11:54.510
<v Speaker 1>came after me hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1664
01:11:54.570 --> 01:11:57.030
<v Speaker 1>but I was fortunate because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1665
01:11:57.031 --> 01:12:01.440
<v Speaker 1>they called me every name under the book</v>
<v Speaker 1>and went after my character.</v>

1666
01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:02.453
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose there was some degree of of </v>

1667
01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:06.233
<v Speaker 1>that was understandable to some degree </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you stand up against </v>

1668
01:12:09.151 --> 01:12:11.910
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you stand up against the radical,</v>

1669
01:12:11.911 --> 01:12:14.190
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe you're a communist might not.</v>

1670
01:12:14.190 --> 01:12:15.023
<v Speaker 1>Probably not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause you don't have to be a communist </v>

1671
01:12:16.261 --> 01:12:17.640
<v Speaker 1>to not like the radical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1672
01:12:17.910 --> 01:12:19.590
<v Speaker 1>But if you stand up against the radical </v>
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>

1673
01:12:19.591 --> 01:12:21.960
<v Speaker 1>well maybe you're a Nazi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well probably not.</v>

1674
01:12:21.990 --> 01:12:24.900
<v Speaker 1>But you might be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's certainly in the interest of</v>

1675
01:12:24.901 --> 01:12:28.710
<v Speaker 1>the people who are proponents of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy of the radical left to assume</v>

1676
01:12:28.711 --> 01:12:30.930
<v Speaker 1>that you're a Nazi because then they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have to deal with you.</v>

1677
01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:34.590
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You throw yourself into the fray,</v>

1678
01:12:34.591 --> 01:12:36.870
<v Speaker 1>people try to localize you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they do that by saying,</v>

1679
01:12:36.871 --> 01:12:37.650
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're this,</v>

1680
01:12:37.650 --> 01:12:38.760
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe this,</v>

1681
01:12:38.761 --> 01:12:40.290
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1682
01:12:40.291 --> 01:12:41.550
<v Speaker 1>well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe not too.</v>

1683
01:12:41.930 --> 01:12:43.170
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1684
01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:47.310
<v Speaker 1>but I already had 250 hours of lectures </v>
<v Speaker 1>up on Youtube at that point.</v>

1685
01:12:47.311 --> 01:12:48.144
<v Speaker 1>So people could actually go and see what</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had said because virtually every word </v>

1686
01:12:50.911 --> 01:12:53.430
<v Speaker 1>I'd ever said to students in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>professional capacity,</v>

1687
01:12:53.700 --> 01:12:56.520
<v Speaker 1>not on every word because I didn't tape </v>
<v Speaker 1>every lecture,</v>

1688
01:12:56.850 --> 01:12:57.683
<v Speaker 1>but I taped multiple years of lectures </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so people went over those with a </v>

1689
01:13:02.521 --> 01:13:03.354
<v Speaker 1>fine tooth comb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to find out if there's anything </v>

1690
01:13:04.780 --> 01:13:07.080
<v Speaker 1>I'd ever said that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he couldn't find anything.</v>

1691
01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:10.620
<v Speaker 1>And that was because I'd been very </v>
<v Speaker 1>careful with what I say.</v>

1692
01:13:11.030 --> 01:13:11.863
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1693
01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:12.833
<v Speaker 1>ever since I was about 25 I started </v>
<v Speaker 1>paying attention to what I was saying </v>

1694
01:13:16.111 --> 01:13:16.944
<v Speaker 1>and not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and trying very hard not to say things </v>

1695
01:13:20.101 --> 01:13:23.790
<v Speaker 1>that I would</v>
<v Speaker 1>try,</v>

1696
01:13:23.791 --> 01:13:24.624
<v Speaker 1>not trying very hard not to say things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that something in me objected to so and </v>

1697
01:13:31.050 --> 01:13:34.500
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems to have been provided me with</v>

1698
01:13:34.501 --> 01:13:37.560
<v Speaker 1>a buffer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so people came to my website because</v>

1699
01:13:37.561 --> 01:13:41.280
<v Speaker 1>they were interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well before the political stuff blew up,</v>

1700
01:13:41.281 --> 01:13:43.920
<v Speaker 1>I had a million views on youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which isn't nothing.</v>

1701
01:13:44.270 --> 01:13:45.103
<v Speaker 1>1 million of anything is a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then when the political scandals </v>

1702
01:13:48.301 --> 01:13:49.740
<v Speaker 1>started to break,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1703
01:13:49.770 --> 01:13:52.380
<v Speaker 1>then people came for them but stayed for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the content.</v>

1704
01:13:52.381 --> 01:13:54.480
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's been really useful.</v>

1705
01:13:54.570 --> 01:13:55.403
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's,</v>

1706
01:13:55.740 --> 01:13:57.080
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not that surprising.</v>

1707
01:13:57.081 --> 01:13:57.631
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1708
01:13:57.631 --> 01:13:59.870
<v Speaker 1>because of what you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like pe,</v>

1709
01:14:00.300 --> 01:14:01.133
<v Speaker 1>there's a great hunger for information </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is practical and useful and that </v>

1710
01:14:06.901 --> 01:14:10.680
<v Speaker 1>helps people find meaning in their lives</v>
<v Speaker 1>and orient themselves.</v>

1711
01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:11.513
<v Speaker 1>There's a great hunger for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And most of my lectures were derived </v>

1712
01:14:13.991 --> 01:14:17.740
<v Speaker 1>from solid psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of it experimental,</v>

1713
01:14:17.741 --> 01:14:20.050
<v Speaker 1>some of that biological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of it from,</v>

1714
01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:22.480
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the domains of neuroscience,</v>

1715
01:14:22.690 --> 01:14:23.523
<v Speaker 1>a lot of it from great clinicians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not surprising that people find it </v>

1716
01:14:25.871 --> 01:14:29.470
<v Speaker 1>helpful because yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well great clinicians were great because</v>

1717
01:14:29.471 --> 01:14:32.470
<v Speaker 1>they were really helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so to distill that into,</v>

1718
01:14:32.471 --> 01:14:36.700
<v Speaker 1>offer it to people in a digestible form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have that have a good effect on them.</v>

1719
01:14:36.970 --> 01:14:38.860
<v Speaker 1>While that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you'd expect,</v>

1720
01:14:38.861 --> 01:14:40.450
<v Speaker 1>that's what the whole discipline is </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

1721
01:14:40.870 --> 01:14:42.640
<v Speaker 1>And so that's been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's been great.</v>

1722
01:14:42.670 --> 01:14:43.503
<v Speaker 1>These,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these public lectures that I've been </v>

1723
01:14:44.471 --> 01:14:45.304
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I've think I've done 50 of them in </v>

1724
01:14:47.741 --> 01:14:50.680
<v Speaker 1>about 45 different cities now in about </v>
<v Speaker 1>three months.</v>

1725
01:14:50.681 --> 01:14:51.514
<v Speaker 1>And the average theater sizes between 20</v>
<v Speaker 1>503,000 people and they're unbelievably </v>

1726
01:14:56.921 --> 01:15:00.190
<v Speaker 1>positive events because people come </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and we talk mostly about</v>

1727
01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:02.553
<v Speaker 1>the political spectrum and why there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>room for voices on the left and why </v>

1728
01:15:05.801 --> 01:15:09.730
<v Speaker 1>there's room for voices on the right and</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the parameters of that should be.</v>

1729
01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:10.593
<v Speaker 1>Because both of those can descend into </v>
<v Speaker 1>extremism and that's not good at the </v>

1730
01:15:13.511 --> 01:15:17.710
<v Speaker 1>role of individual responsibility and </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual sovereignty and the necessity</v>

1731
01:15:17.711 --> 01:15:18.544
<v Speaker 1>for people to develop a vision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sorts of things that we already </v>

1732
01:15:20.441 --> 01:15:23.590
<v Speaker 1>talked about and virtually everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's coming there,</v>

1733
01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:25.600
<v Speaker 1>they're not coming for political </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>

1734
01:15:25.630 --> 01:15:26.463
<v Speaker 1>Even though that's the story you hear </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the more ideologically possessed </v>

1735
01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:33.370
<v Speaker 1>journalist types because they see the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world that way,</v>

1736
01:15:33.371 --> 01:15:35.830
<v Speaker 1>they can't imagine anything else could </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly be happening,</v>

1737
01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:37.053
<v Speaker 1>but the people who are coming to these </v>
<v Speaker 1>lectures are coming because they are </v>

1738
01:15:38.801 --> 01:15:43.801
<v Speaker 1>doing everything they possibly can to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make their lives better so and so.</v>

1739
01:15:44.081 --> 01:15:48.050
<v Speaker 1>And it's lovely to talk to people like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that because it is great.</v>

1740
01:15:48.730 --> 01:15:50.860
<v Speaker 1>It's literally great school of greatness</v>
<v Speaker 1>baby.</v>

1741
01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:52.570
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1742
01:15:52.870 --> 01:15:53.703
<v Speaker 1>I've got six minutes to be mindful of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your time and your schedule and I want </v>

1743
01:15:56.731 --> 01:15:58.960
<v Speaker 1>to ask you three final questions if </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's okay.</v>

1744
01:15:58.960 --> 01:15:59.793
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you bet.</v>

1745
01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:00.633
<v Speaker 1>So as much as I would love for you to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>on for another few hours on these </v>

1746
01:16:03.281 --> 01:16:05.770
<v Speaker 1>answers so I can get to the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>

1747
01:16:06.130 --> 01:16:08.950
<v Speaker 1>I'll do my best to be brief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish I could go out longer,</v>

1748
01:16:08.951 --> 01:16:10.900
<v Speaker 1>so we'll have to have you come back as </v>
<v Speaker 1>time here in la.</v>

1749
01:16:11.290 --> 01:16:12.123
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first one is what is your purpose </v>

1750
01:16:13.601 --> 01:16:16.120
<v Speaker 1>now moving forward through everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've had in your life?</v>

1751
01:16:16.121 --> 01:16:18.280
<v Speaker 1>What's your purpose moving forward?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While I've,</v>

1752
01:16:18.910 --> 01:16:20.520
<v Speaker 1>I've specific,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1753
01:16:20.770 --> 01:16:21.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1754
01:16:22.150 --> 01:16:25.480
<v Speaker 1>what's my purpose?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What am I aiming at?</v>

1755
01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:26.890
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to,</v>

1756
01:16:26.891 --> 01:16:28.960
<v Speaker 1>I did a series of Biblical lectures last</v>
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

1757
01:16:28.961 --> 01:16:32.650
<v Speaker 1>I did 15 lectures on genesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to continue doing that.</v>

1758
01:16:32.651 --> 01:16:34.840
<v Speaker 1>So in November,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to start with the exodus story</v>

1759
01:16:34.841 --> 01:16:37.780
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what I'd like to do over the next 15</v>

1760
01:16:37.781 --> 01:16:41.440
<v Speaker 1>years is make my way through the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>corpus of biblical writings.</v>

1761
01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:44.590
<v Speaker 1>So that's one major goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to write another book.</v>

1762
01:16:44.620 --> 01:16:46.210
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've written half of it already,</v>

1763
01:16:46.211 --> 01:16:47.044
<v Speaker 1>which will be a follow up to 12 rules </v>
<v Speaker 1>for life cause I actually had laid out </v>

1764
01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:54.480
<v Speaker 1>on a site called Quora 40 rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'll do that and write in another</v>

1765
01:16:56.111 --> 01:16:58.510
<v Speaker 1>couple of books I suspect over the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>few years.</v>

1766
01:16:59.050 --> 01:17:00.340
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1767
01:17:00.460 --> 01:17:01.990
<v Speaker 1>the touring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to continue,</v>

1768
01:17:01.991 --> 01:17:02.824
<v Speaker 1>I have 10 cities coming up in Canada and</v>
<v Speaker 1>another 20 in the u s and then 12 in </v>

1769
01:17:07.481 --> 01:17:08.314
<v Speaker 1>Europe and I'm going to go to Australia </v>
<v Speaker 1>in February and then back to Europe I </v>

1770
01:17:11.451 --> 01:17:12.284
<v Speaker 1>think in April.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's lots of touring on the </v>

1771
01:17:13.761 --> 01:17:17.330
<v Speaker 1>horizon and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's for the reasons I already described</v>

1772
01:17:18.230 --> 01:17:19.820
<v Speaker 1>and having,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1773
01:17:20.060 --> 01:17:20.893
<v Speaker 1>the lectures differ every night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although there are themes that </v>

1774
01:17:22.611 --> 01:17:23.444
<v Speaker 1>constantly emerge and I'm using those as</v>
<v Speaker 1>an opportunity to have a detailed and </v>

1775
01:17:27.111 --> 01:17:27.944
<v Speaker 1>engaged discussion with the audience </v>
<v Speaker 1>about how we might proceed forward </v>

1776
01:17:32.930 --> 01:17:33.763
<v Speaker 1>individually and collectively so that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>can make things consciously better and </v>

1777
01:17:38.031 --> 01:17:38.864
<v Speaker 1>why that's associated with necessary </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning and why that's a moral </v>

1778
01:17:42.261 --> 01:17:43.094
<v Speaker 1>obligation.</v>

1779
01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:46.340
<v Speaker 1>So it's a dialogue about </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibilities and not rights,</v>

1780
01:17:46.460 --> 01:17:47.293
<v Speaker 1>even though right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rights are only important in so far as </v>

1781
01:17:49.281 --> 01:17:51.650
<v Speaker 1>they set up the space for you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulder,</v>

1782
01:17:51.651 --> 01:17:54.920
<v Speaker 1>you're proper responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as a sovereign citizen,</v>

1783
01:17:54.921 --> 01:17:55.754
<v Speaker 1>you have the responsibility for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>integrity of the state resting on your </v>

1784
01:17:58.701 --> 01:17:59.534
<v Speaker 1>shoulders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's something that if you don't </v>

1785
01:18:00.741 --> 01:18:01.574
<v Speaker 1>take seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the state shakes and that's not </v>

1786
01:18:03.951 --> 01:18:04.784
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm trying to convey that to </v>

1787
01:18:05.961 --> 01:18:07.130
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you have,</v>

1788
01:18:07.310 --> 01:18:09.710
<v Speaker 1>there's actually something that you need</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>

1789
01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:13.340
<v Speaker 1>You need to take care of yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to take care of your family,</v>

1790
01:18:13.430 --> 01:18:16.280
<v Speaker 1>you need to take care of your community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't do that,</v>

1791
01:18:16.370 --> 01:18:19.250
<v Speaker 1>then there'll be hell to pay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's on you,</v>

1792
01:18:19.670 --> 01:18:20.630
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each of us.</v>

1793
01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:23.210
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard for people to grasp that while</v>

1794
01:18:23.211 --> 01:18:24.440
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1795
01:18:24.441 --> 01:18:26.330
<v Speaker 1>maybe because they don't want the </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility,</v>

1796
01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:29.180
<v Speaker 1>but then they don't get any meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they suffer,</v>

1797
01:18:29.300 --> 01:18:30.290
<v Speaker 1>then they get better.</v>

1798
01:18:30.380 --> 01:18:32.210
<v Speaker 1>That's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

1799
01:18:32.750 --> 01:18:36.710
<v Speaker 1>which of these are you going to pick?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's also salutary to people because</v>

1800
01:18:37.250 --> 01:18:42.200
<v Speaker 1>it's useful for everyone to know that if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't live up to your potential,</v>

1801
01:18:42.201 --> 01:18:43.034
<v Speaker 1>that you leave a hole in the fabric of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being and it's filled by something </v>

1802
01:18:46.281 --> 01:18:47.114
<v Speaker 1>approximating hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And unless that's what you want and you </v>

1803
01:18:49.491 --> 01:18:51.500
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1804
01:18:51.501 --> 01:18:52.334
<v Speaker 1>and it's perfectly possible to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>serious discussion with 3000 people </v>

1805
01:18:55.521 --> 01:18:59.600
<v Speaker 1>about this and there are right on board </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it all the way.</v>

1806
01:19:00.050 --> 01:19:03.110
<v Speaker 1>And so that's really something amazing </v>
<v Speaker 1>to behold.</v>

1807
01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:07.220
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things I've realized is </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of these new technologies,</v>

1808
01:19:07.221 --> 01:19:10.730
<v Speaker 1>the technologies you're using enabled </v>
<v Speaker 1>these long form discussions,</v>

1809
01:19:11.060 --> 01:19:12.920
<v Speaker 1>turns out that people are smarter than </v>
<v Speaker 1>we thought.</v>

1810
01:19:12.921 --> 01:19:13.880
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1811
01:19:13.940 --> 01:19:15.410
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>TV narrowed it,</v>

1812
01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:16.273
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 seconds say you're complicated thing </v>

1813
01:19:18.141 --> 01:19:19.190
<v Speaker 1>in 30 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1814
01:19:20.100 --> 01:19:21.260
<v Speaker 1>like can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1815
01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:22.423
<v Speaker 1>And so we were viewing the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the population through this narrow </v>

1816
01:19:26.181 --> 01:19:28.040
<v Speaker 1>window and everyone looked kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid.</v>

1817
01:19:28.041 --> 01:19:30.440
<v Speaker 1>It's like now the windows fully open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1818
01:19:30.470 --> 01:19:31.303
<v Speaker 1>Oh look at that you people like 40 hour </v>
<v Speaker 1>netflix specials that are incredibly </v>

1819
01:19:37.161 --> 01:19:38.840
<v Speaker 1>complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1820
01:19:39.110 --> 01:19:42.590
<v Speaker 1>And you like three hour Joe Rogan </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussions that are complicated.</v>

1821
01:19:42.591 --> 01:19:44.000
<v Speaker 1>You'll follow the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1822
01:19:44.030 --> 01:19:45.410
<v Speaker 1>oh good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're smarter than we thought.</v>

1823
01:19:45.411 --> 01:19:48.200
<v Speaker 1>Thank God for that because we better be </v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

1824
01:19:48.380 --> 01:19:50.540
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where I'm aiming at the future.</v>

1825
01:19:50.780 --> 01:19:52.200
<v Speaker 1>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1826

<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>question number two,</v>

1827

<v Speaker 1>you've got the 12 rules for life.</v>

1828
01:19:56.091 --> 01:19:57.860
<v Speaker 1>Make sure you guys again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go pick it up.</v>

1829

<v Speaker 1>authoring for you university students </v>

1854
01:20:51.181 --> 01:20:52.230
<v Speaker 1>out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1855
01:20:52.231 --> 01:20:56.820
<v Speaker 1>the future authoring program decreases </v>
<v Speaker 1>your probability of dropout.</v>

1856
01:20:56.821 --> 01:20:57.654
<v Speaker 1>If you're in a college program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>university program by somewhere between </v>

1857
01:20:59.911 --> 01:21:02.820
<v Speaker 1>25 and 50%,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're kind of aimless,</v>

1858
01:21:02.821 --> 01:21:03.654
<v Speaker 1>it works better if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you already got a plan and you're </v>

1859
01:21:05.671 --> 01:21:07.560
<v Speaker 1>implementing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got a good direction,</v>

1860
01:21:07.561 --> 01:21:08.394
<v Speaker 1>then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not as helpful because you're </v>

1861
01:21:09.841 --> 01:21:10.770
<v Speaker 1>already halfway there.</v>

1862
01:21:10.770 --> 01:21:13.230
<v Speaker 1>But if you're kind of lost and you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1863
01:21:13.260 --> 01:21:16.470
<v Speaker 1>it'll help you not only establish your </v>
<v Speaker 1>goals but stick to them.</v>

1864
01:21:16.530 --> 01:21:20.910
<v Speaker 1>It really helps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've done three very detailed published</v>

1865
01:21:20.911 --> 01:21:23.950
<v Speaker 1>peer reviewed studies showing that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>really works powerful.</v>

1866
01:21:23.990 --> 01:21:25.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it doesn't hurt you either.</v>

1867
01:21:25.351 --> 01:21:26.760
<v Speaker 1>That's the other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>

1868
01:21:26.820 --> 01:21:28.160
<v Speaker 1>So that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1869
01:21:28.170 --> 01:21:29.003
<v Speaker 1>you've got the 1204 five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got something called the three </v>

1870
01:21:30.901 --> 01:21:31.734
<v Speaker 1>truths.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a question I ask everyone at the </v>

1871
01:21:32.860 --> 01:21:34.720
<v Speaker 1>end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

1872
01:21:35.220 --> 01:21:37.540
<v Speaker 1>so we're gonna try and boil this down </v>
<v Speaker 1>for three truths for you.</v>

1873
01:21:38.070 --> 01:21:38.903
<v Speaker 1>Imagine this is your last day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get to choose the day for you when </v>

1874
01:21:41.610 --> 01:21:42.500
<v Speaker 1>you die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

1875
01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:44.100
<v Speaker 1>It's many years away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's one of the B.</v>

1876
01:21:44.430 --> 01:21:46.980
<v Speaker 1>And you've achieved your purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything you set out,</v>

1877
01:21:47.010 --> 01:21:51.130
<v Speaker 1>you aim for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hit the target and then Yup,</v>

1878
01:21:51.270 --> 01:21:53.310
<v Speaker 1>you pass away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the last day.</v>

1879
01:21:53.430 --> 01:21:55.020
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a celebration.</v>

1880
01:21:55.080 --> 01:21:56.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for whatever reason,</v>

1881
01:21:56.521 --> 01:21:59.640
<v Speaker 1>there's no more videos of you up online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no more lecturers,</v>

1882
01:21:59.641 --> 01:22:02.280
<v Speaker 1>no more podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no more books for whatever reason,</v>

1883
01:22:02.281 --> 01:22:03.114
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to take them with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So no one has access to your </v>

1884
01:22:05.491 --> 01:22:06.324
<v Speaker 1>information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you get to a piece of paper and you </v>

1885
01:22:08.341 --> 01:22:09.174
<v Speaker 1>get to write down three things you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be true about your life that you </v>

1886
01:22:11.371 --> 01:22:12.204
<v Speaker 1>would pass on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to call it the three things that </v>

1887
01:22:14.371 --> 01:22:15.270
<v Speaker 1>make you weak.</v>

1888
01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:19.650
<v Speaker 4>I'm one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hm Hm hm.</v>

1889
01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:20.793
<v Speaker 1>Lift your eyes above the horizon and aim</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the highest star that you can </v>

1890
01:22:23.381 --> 01:22:24.214
<v Speaker 1>contemplate.</v>

1891
01:22:27.620 --> 01:22:28.520
<v Speaker 3>What's the third one?</v>

1892
01:22:30.810 --> 01:22:31.920
<v Speaker 1>Put Your family in order.</v>

1893
01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:33.830
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1894
01:22:35.300 --> 01:22:37.070
<v Speaker 3>Powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Before I ask the final question,</v>

1895
01:22:37.100 --> 01:22:38.750
<v Speaker 3>I want to acknowledge you for a moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jordan,</v>

1896
01:22:38.751 --> 01:22:42.530
<v Speaker 3>for your incredible wisdom and </v>
<v Speaker 3>vulnerability with me.</v>

1897
01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:43.433
<v Speaker 3>We just met.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I feel very connected to you and </v>

1898
01:22:45.711 --> 01:22:48.670
<v Speaker 3>your mission and your purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1899
01:22:48.680 --> 01:22:53.480
<v Speaker 3>I just appreciate everything you've been</v>
<v Speaker 3>through as a father and as a husband,</v>

1900
01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:54.830
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for your,</v>

1901
01:22:54.831 --> 01:22:56.040
<v Speaker 3>for your daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for your son,</v>

1902
01:22:56.041 --> 01:22:56.874
<v Speaker 3>and for your wife to continue to move on</v>
<v Speaker 3>in your own dreams and pursuit of </v>

1903
01:23:00.860 --> 01:23:04.730
<v Speaker 3>bettering humanity while going through </v>
<v Speaker 3>all that you've gone through.</v>

1904
01:23:04.790 --> 01:23:05.920
<v Speaker 3>So really knowledge,</v>

1905
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:06.843
<v Speaker 1>everything you've been doing and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you stand for and your ability to use </v>

1906
01:23:10.661 --> 01:23:11.494
<v Speaker 1>your words carefully to make sure to try</v>
<v Speaker 1>and make the best impact on people who </v>

1907
01:23:15.641 --> 01:23:16.474
<v Speaker 1>are listening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm like acknowledge you for all of </v>

1908
01:23:17.451 --> 01:23:18.284
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope we get to have you come back </v>

1909
01:23:19.570 --> 01:23:22.300
<v Speaker 1>sometime when you're in la cause I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can go for another hour or two.</v>

1910
01:23:22.660 --> 01:23:23.493
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the final question is what's your </v>

1911
01:23:26.141 --> 01:23:27.280
<v Speaker 1>definition of greatness?</v>

1912
01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:32.353
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1913
01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:33.593
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>greatness is what reveals itself when </v>

1914
01:23:35.011 --> 01:23:35.844
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1915
01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:38.670
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

1916
01:23:38.670 --> 01:23:43.670
<v Speaker 1>When you attempt to formulate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you attempt to carefully articulate</v>

1917
01:23:44.461 --> 01:23:46.140
<v Speaker 1>and live out what you believe to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>true,</v>

1918
01:23:47.310 --> 01:23:50.910
<v Speaker 1>it just happens because there isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything more powerful than truth,</v>

1919
01:23:52.110 --> 01:23:52.620
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1920
01:23:52.620 --> 01:23:54.870
<v Speaker 1>That's the antidote to suffering truth,</v>

1921
01:23:56.030 --> 01:23:56.863
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1922
01:23:57.020 --> 01:23:58.790
<v Speaker 1>So it's a strange thing because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

1923
01:23:58.791 --> 01:23:59.321
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1924
01:23:59.321 --> 01:24:01.070
<v Speaker 1>it produces a lot of suffering too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1925
01:24:01.430 --> 01:24:02.990
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the short term.</v>

1926
01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:04.353
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1927
01:24:04.610 --> 01:24:05.690
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>

1928
01:24:06.140 --> 01:24:06.860
<v Speaker 1>Thank you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sir.</v>

1929
01:24:06.860 --> 01:24:07.693
<v Speaker 1>You Bet.</v>

1930

<v Speaker 1>opportunity.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
