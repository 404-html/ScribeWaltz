<v Speaker 3>our talk today is called political </v>

42
00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.513
<v Speaker 3>indoctrination on campus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm grateful to welcome Dr. Jordan </v>

43
00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.013
<v Speaker 3>Peterson as our speaker this evening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dr. Peterson is professor of psychology </v>

44
00:04:30.691 --> 00:04:33.630
<v Speaker 3>and clinical psychologists from Toronto,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Canada.</v>

45
00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.860
<v Speaker 3>He cut his teeth as a professor of </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychology at Harvard University and now</v>

46
00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:38.694
<v Speaker 3>as a professor at the University of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Toronto where hopefully he enjoys the </v>

47
00:04:41.911 --> 00:04:44.550
<v Speaker 3>full protection of a robust tenure </v>
<v Speaker 3>tenure policy.</v>

48
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.460
<v Speaker 3>He's the author of two books,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maps of meaning,</v>

49
00:04:47.461 --> 00:04:51.210
<v Speaker 3>which is on my nightstand right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and 12 rules for life,</v>

50
00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:52.830
<v Speaker 3>an antidote to chaos.</v>

51
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.060
<v Speaker 3>Dr. Peterson is also the author or </v>
<v Speaker 3>coauthor of over 100 scientific articles</v>

52
00:04:57.061 --> 00:05:00.900
<v Speaker 3>on issues such as alcoholism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>aggression in the neurology of political</v>

53
00:05:00.901 --> 00:05:02.970
<v Speaker 3>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As I understand the titles,</v>

54
00:05:02.971 --> 00:05:03.804
<v Speaker 3>because I didn't read 100 articles in </v>
<v Speaker 3>2013 Dr. Peterson began recording his </v>

55
00:05:07.891 --> 00:05:08.990
<v Speaker 3>lectures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

56
00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.670
<v Speaker 3>personality and its transformations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maps of meaning,</v>

57
00:05:11.671 --> 00:05:14.520
<v Speaker 3>the architecture of belief and uploading</v>
<v Speaker 3>them to youtube,</v>

58
00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:18.300
<v Speaker 3>which had been very popular.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will admit publicly that I listened to</v>

59
00:05:18.301 --> 00:05:21.840
<v Speaker 3>many of his podcasts this past summer </v>
<v Speaker 3>while on long training runs.</v>

60
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.380
<v Speaker 3>They don't do much for pace,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they keep you going for a long time.</v>

61
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.833
<v Speaker 3>Talk to Peterson made something of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>public splash in 2016 when he made a </v>

62
00:05:32.011 --> 00:05:34.410
<v Speaker 3>couple of youtube videos criticizing </v>
<v Speaker 3>Canada's bill.</v>

63
00:05:34.411 --> 00:05:35.244
<v Speaker 3>See 16 which adds gender expression and </v>
<v Speaker 3>identity as a protected class under the </v>

64
00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.990
<v Speaker 3>Canadian Human Rights Act.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dr. Peterson argued that a person can be</v>

65
00:05:42.991 --> 00:05:46.290
<v Speaker 3>prosecuted for refusing to use preferred</v>
<v Speaker 3>pronouns.</v>

66
00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.740
<v Speaker 3>A similar law has recently been passed </v>
<v Speaker 3>in California,</v>

67
00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.550
<v Speaker 3>which of course raises the issue of </v>
<v Speaker 3>forced speech and the first amendment.</v>

68
00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.460
<v Speaker 3>After these videos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a Dr. Peterson acquired some notoriety.</v>

69
00:05:58.880 --> 00:05:59.713
<v Speaker 3>His Youtube channel has gathered more </v>
<v Speaker 3>than 450,000 subscribers and his videos </v>

70
00:06:03.531 --> 00:06:05.570
<v Speaker 3>have received more than 25 million </v>
<v Speaker 3>views.</v>

71
00:06:05.571 --> 00:06:10.370
<v Speaker 3>As of October,</v>
<v Speaker 3>2017 his classroom lectures on mythology</v>

72
00:06:10.371 --> 00:06:14.840
<v Speaker 3>were turned into a wildly popular 13 </v>
<v Speaker 3>part TV series on TV Ontario.</v>

73
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:18.590
<v Speaker 3>Dr. Peterson also has a biblical lecture</v>
<v Speaker 3>series on Tuesday evenings,</v>

74
00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:19.723
<v Speaker 3>which are almost always sold out and if </v>
<v Speaker 3>any reason to move back to Toronto for </v>

75
00:06:23.541 --> 00:06:24.530
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be one of them.</v>

76
00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.170
<v Speaker 3>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I learned that like me,</v>

77
00:06:27.171 --> 00:06:28.004
<v Speaker 3>Dr. Peterson hails from Alberta,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I assume he's a right thinking man and </v>

78
00:06:30.891 --> 00:06:34.280
<v Speaker 3>Dustin Edmonton Oilers Fan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ladies and gentlemen,</v>

79
00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:35.210
<v Speaker 3>Dr. Peterson</v>

80
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:40.360
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

81
00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:57.300
<v Speaker 4>Thank you very much for inviting me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can you hear me at the back?</v>

82
00:06:58.530 --> 00:06:59.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's good.</v>

83
00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:01.053
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well we might as well get right into </v>

84
00:07:05.321 --> 00:07:10.321
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I want to go as deeply underneath the</v>

85
00:07:11.801 --> 00:07:14.470
<v Speaker 4>problem as I can possibly manage </v>
<v Speaker 4>tonight.</v>

86
00:07:14.471 --> 00:07:15.304
<v Speaker 4>So I'm going to marry some of my</v>
<v Speaker 4>ideas about what you might describe as </v>

87
00:07:22.451 --> 00:07:27.451
<v Speaker 4>the grammatical structure of belief with</v>
<v Speaker 4>some more overtly political analysis,</v>

88
00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:31.593
<v Speaker 4>concentrating on what actually what </v>
<v Speaker 4>constitutes ideology because w one of </v>

89
00:07:36.241 --> 00:07:37.770
<v Speaker 4>the things that I've been trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>figure out,</v>

90
00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:39.150
<v Speaker 4>and I guess this is</v>

91
00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:41.643
<v Speaker 4>part of my attempt to wrestle with some </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the actual problems that the </v>

92
00:07:43.961 --> 00:07:48.961
<v Speaker 4>postmodernist pose because I don't mean </v>
<v Speaker 4>as people or as thinkers,</v>

93
00:07:49.001 --> 00:07:49.834
<v Speaker 4>I mean conceptually because you always </v>
<v Speaker 4>have to give the devil his due so to </v>

94
00:07:53.411 --> 00:07:54.244
<v Speaker 4>speak.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there are elements of postmodern </v>

95
00:07:56.531 --> 00:07:57.364
<v Speaker 4>thought like the idea that there's an </v>
<v Speaker 4>infinite number of interpretations for </v>

96
00:08:01.031 --> 00:08:04.870
<v Speaker 4>any finite set of facts that actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>happened to be true.</v>

97
00:08:04.871 --> 00:08:07.850
<v Speaker 4>And there are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're quite problematic and it's,</v>

98
00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:08.773
<v Speaker 4>it's for good reasons as well as bad </v>
<v Speaker 4>reasons that postmodernism has become </v>

99
00:08:12.101 --> 00:08:12.934
<v Speaker 4>such a dominant strain of thought.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so it's necessary to take it </v>

100
00:08:16.511 --> 00:08:18.940
<v Speaker 4>seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I've been trying to,</v>

101
00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:20.860
<v Speaker 4>one of the things I've been trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>figure out is,</v>

102
00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:22.113
<v Speaker 4>is there a reasonable way of </v>
<v Speaker 4>distinguishing a philosophy from an </v>

103
00:08:25.421 --> 00:08:26.254
<v Speaker 4>ideology in the pop?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The postmodernist answer to that is </v>

104
00:08:28.061 --> 00:08:32.050
<v Speaker 4>basically know that it's ideology all </v>
<v Speaker 4>the way down,</v>

105
00:08:32.051 --> 00:08:33.940
<v Speaker 4>like the turtles all the way down there.</v>

106
00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:37.240
<v Speaker 4>You'd never escaped from the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from the grip of your,</v>

107
00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:39.970
<v Speaker 4>of your viewpoint in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

108
00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:43.510
<v Speaker 4>and there's some truth in that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's not enough truth.</v>

109
00:08:43.511 --> 00:08:44.344
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And one of the hallmarks I would say of </v>

110
00:08:47.291 --> 00:08:48.124
<v Speaker 4>both poss postmodern Andy ideological </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking is the proclivity to reduce </v>

111
00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:56.250
<v Speaker 4>very complex phenomena to single causes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But anyways,</v>

112
00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:57.353
<v Speaker 4>so we're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to go underneath things as </v>

113
00:08:59.101 --> 00:08:59.934
<v Speaker 4>far as we possibly can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the first thing that I'd like to </v>

114
00:09:02.431 --> 00:09:05.610
<v Speaker 4>point out is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or like to discuss is the actual problem</v>

115
00:09:05.611 --> 00:09:06.444
<v Speaker 4>that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we're all trying to solve in some </v>

116
00:09:08.041 --> 00:09:08.874
<v Speaker 4>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>including the ideologues who claim to </v>

117
00:09:12.061 --> 00:09:13.890
<v Speaker 4>have the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>

118
00:09:13.891 --> 00:09:16.350
<v Speaker 4>interests of either the working class or</v>
<v Speaker 4>the were,</v>

119
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:20.640
<v Speaker 4>or the oppressed upper most in their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in their imagination,</v>

120
00:09:20.641 --> 00:09:23.100
<v Speaker 4>in their heart or in their intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 4>concerns.</v>

121
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:24.533
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's absolutely no doubt that </v>

122
00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:28.013
<v Speaker 4>there is oppression and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that there's no shortage of </v>

123
00:09:30.031 --> 00:09:31.080
<v Speaker 4>suffering in the world.</v>

124
00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:31.913
<v Speaker 4>And I do think that's not only the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fundamental but also the fundamental </v>

125
00:09:35.371 --> 00:09:39.480
<v Speaker 4>reality of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is an existential theme.</v>

126
00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.660
<v Speaker 4>It was developed at least to some degree</v>
<v Speaker 4>by Martin heidegger.</v>

127
00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.630
<v Speaker 4>Heidegger had a concept that he called </v>
<v Speaker 4>thrownness,</v>

128
00:09:45.631 --> 00:09:47.590
<v Speaker 4>which is an interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

129
00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:52.530
<v Speaker 4>an interesting idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And thrownness is,</v>

130
00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:53.483
<v Speaker 4>is a brief description of the arbitrary </v>
<v Speaker 4>nature of human being or even of being </v>

131
00:09:59.821 --> 00:10:03.210
<v Speaker 4>itself and the arbitrary nature it can </v>
<v Speaker 4>be.</v>

132
00:10:03.211 --> 00:10:05.070
<v Speaker 4>It can be his,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the word he used for that,</v>

133
00:10:05.071 --> 00:10:07.800
<v Speaker 4>which is a German word,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can be translated in other ways.</v>

134
00:10:07.801 --> 00:10:11.670
<v Speaker 4>It can be translated as abandoned or </v>
<v Speaker 4>dereliction or dejection,</v>

135
00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:15.800
<v Speaker 4>which obviously are much harsher words </v>
<v Speaker 4>than mere thrownness thrown.</v>

136
00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:16.683
<v Speaker 4>This is more of a detached term.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what it means is that it's a </v>

137
00:10:20.731 --> 00:10:21.564
<v Speaker 4>characteristic of human conscious </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience to be underpinned by </v>

138
00:10:26.731 --> 00:10:27.564
<v Speaker 4>arbitrary realities that have nothing to</v>
<v Speaker 4>do in some sense with your choice as a </v>

139
00:10:32.851 --> 00:10:33.390
<v Speaker 4>being.</v>

140
00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:37.920
<v Speaker 4>And so some of the elements of being </v>
<v Speaker 4>thrown are that you're born into certain</v>

141
00:10:37.921 --> 00:10:42.420
<v Speaker 4>time rather than a different time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That seems like it's an irrational fact.</v>

142
00:10:42.421 --> 00:10:43.254
<v Speaker 4>That's how young would describe it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Carl Young as it's an irrational fact </v>

143
00:10:46.021 --> 00:10:49.500
<v Speaker 4>because there's no real way of </v>
<v Speaker 4>accounting for it from a,</v>

144
00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:52.020
<v Speaker 4>from a causal perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>

145
00:10:52.021 --> 00:10:56.310
<v Speaker 4>not subjectively speaking and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>born a certain race and you're born with</v>

146
00:10:56.311 --> 00:10:58.020
<v Speaker 4>a certain level of intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say.</v>

147
00:10:58.021 --> 00:11:00.690
<v Speaker 4>Although that can be impaired certainly </v>
<v Speaker 4>with enough effort.</v>

148
00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:02.093
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're born in a certain culture </v>

149
00:11:05.401 --> 00:11:06.234
<v Speaker 4>with a certain language and at a certain</v>
<v Speaker 4>socioeconomic it has certain </v>

150
00:11:09.151 --> 00:11:09.984
<v Speaker 4>socioeconomic class and with a certain </v>
<v Speaker 4>degree of attractiveness and those are </v>

151
00:11:12.841 --> 00:11:15.240
<v Speaker 4>things that are all handed to you in </v>
<v Speaker 4>some sense they,</v>

152
00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:19.050
<v Speaker 4>they make up the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in some sense they make up the axiomatic</v>

153
00:11:19.051 --> 00:11:19.884
<v Speaker 4>structure of your being and some of them</v>
<v Speaker 4>are advantageous and others are </v>

154
00:11:23.791 --> 00:11:26.910
<v Speaker 4>disadvantageous and you're stuck with </v>
<v Speaker 4>the end.</v>

155
00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:32.030
<v Speaker 4>That really is a problem partly because </v>
<v Speaker 4>life in and of itself is a problem and a</v>

156
00:11:32.401 --> 00:11:33.234
<v Speaker 4>problem of suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But also because it seems quite evident </v>

157
00:11:36.181 --> 00:11:39.630
<v Speaker 4>that well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or at least that you could make a strong</v>

158
00:11:39.631 --> 00:11:43.650
<v Speaker 4>case that the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the talents and catastrophes of life are</v>

159
00:11:43.651 --> 00:11:44.484
<v Speaker 4>by no means equally distributed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so in some sense there seems to be </v>

160
00:11:47.671 --> 00:11:48.504
<v Speaker 4>an intrinsic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we might regard it from the perspective </v>

161
00:11:50.311 --> 00:11:54.940
<v Speaker 4>of the standards of human justice and </v>
<v Speaker 4>perhaps human mercy as well as something</v>

162
00:11:54.941 --> 00:11:55.774
<v Speaker 4>intrinsically unfair,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unjust about the structure of existence </v>

163
00:11:58.541 --> 00:11:59.374
<v Speaker 4>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now I like the existentialists take on </v>

164
00:12:01.991 --> 00:12:06.990
<v Speaker 4>that because</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the existentialists do is attribute</v>

165
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:07.863
<v Speaker 4>that inequality and injustice and say </v>
<v Speaker 4>unfairness to the structure of being </v>

166
00:12:11.531 --> 00:12:14.710
<v Speaker 4>itself and pose that as the central </v>
<v Speaker 4>problem of life.</v>

167
00:12:14.711 --> 00:12:18.460
<v Speaker 4>And I find that very realistic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like this painting by Van Gogh.</v>

168
00:12:18.461 --> 00:12:20.860
<v Speaker 4>I think it does a very good job of </v>
<v Speaker 4>expressing that.</v>

169
00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:22.083
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's an old man and he's obviously </v>

170
00:12:24.671 --> 00:12:25.504
<v Speaker 4>sorrowful and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's not rich as you can tell by his </v>

171
00:12:28.411 --> 00:12:30.580
<v Speaker 4>shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And like it's rough and,</v>

172
00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:35.980
<v Speaker 4>and he's a nexus of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of oppression and perhaps,</v>

173
00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:38.803
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a nexus of oh oppression in that he may </v>

174
00:12:40.791 --> 00:12:43.880
<v Speaker 4>have served as an oppressor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also someone who's suffering,</v>

175
00:12:43.881 --> 00:12:44.714
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pressed as a consequence of the </v>

176
00:12:45.531 --> 00:12:48.680
<v Speaker 4>conditions of his life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so then the question might be,</v>

177
00:12:48.681 --> 00:12:50.420
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why is life like that?</v>

178
00:12:50.421 --> 00:12:53.180
<v Speaker 4>And that's where and what might be done </v>
<v Speaker 4>about it.</v>

179
00:12:53.181 --> 00:12:55.760
<v Speaker 4>And that's where the differences really </v>
<v Speaker 4>start to arise.</v>

180
00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:56.953
<v Speaker 4>So we can start from the perspective of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the fact that life presents a universal </v>

181
00:13:00.831 --> 00:13:04.130
<v Speaker 4>problem to those of us who are alive and</v>
<v Speaker 4>conscious.</v>

182
00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:09.580
<v Speaker 5>Now</v>
<v Speaker 5>there are various,</v>

183
00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:11.273
<v Speaker 4>what would you call the Metta theories </v>
<v Speaker 4>that account for the existence of this </v>

184
00:13:13.951 --> 00:13:14.784
<v Speaker 4>suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My interpretation of the story of </v>

185
00:13:17.191 --> 00:13:18.024
<v Speaker 4>Genesis essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which in some sense describes the </v>

186
00:13:21.241 --> 00:13:23.040
<v Speaker 4>introduction of suffering into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>

187
00:13:23.041 --> 00:13:23.874
<v Speaker 4>Is that what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what seems to happen in the story of </v>

188
00:13:26.281 --> 00:13:31.281
<v Speaker 4>genesis is that human beings originally </v>
<v Speaker 4>emerge is a mythological representation.</v>

189
00:13:31.651 --> 00:13:35.190
<v Speaker 4>So to deep fictional representation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's one way of thinking about it.</v>

190
00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:36.203
<v Speaker 4>Keeping in mind as you might,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that fiction can be more true than </v>

191
00:13:39.511 --> 00:13:40.344
<v Speaker 4>truth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is partly why we're so attracted </v>

192
00:13:41.731 --> 00:13:42.564
<v Speaker 4>to it because fiction distills truth and</v>
<v Speaker 4>presents it in a much more concentrated </v>

193
00:13:46.861 --> 00:13:47.694
<v Speaker 4>form than,</v>
<v Speaker 4>than a mere description of everyday </v>

194
00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:52.440
<v Speaker 4>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in the genesis story,</v>

195
00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:56.070
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there seems to be an association between</v>

196
00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:59.670
<v Speaker 4>the development of vision and self </v>
<v Speaker 4>consciousness and the awareness of death</v>

197
00:13:59.671 --> 00:14:00.504
<v Speaker 4>and the awareness of good and evil.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those things happen pretty much at </v>

198
00:14:02.731 --> 00:14:04.050
<v Speaker 4>exactly the same time.</v>

199
00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:06.600
<v Speaker 4>And the consequence of that awareness </v>
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

200
00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:08.010
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

201
00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:11.670
<v Speaker 4>are that self consciousness is a dawning</v>
<v Speaker 4>awareness of vulnerability.</v>

202
00:14:11.671 --> 00:14:12.504
<v Speaker 4>You remember in the story of Genesis </v>
<v Speaker 4>when Adam and eve opened their eyes or </v>

203
00:14:15.241 --> 00:14:19.260
<v Speaker 4>have their eyes opened as a consequence </v>
<v Speaker 4>of falling prey to temptation,</v>

204
00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:23.520
<v Speaker 4>the scales fall from their eyes and they</v>
<v Speaker 4>realize that they're naked and then they</v>

205
00:14:23.521 --> 00:14:26.040
<v Speaker 4>immediately cover themselves up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And of course,</v>

206
00:14:26.041 --> 00:14:29.250
<v Speaker 4>the question is what does it mean to </v>
<v Speaker 4>realize that you're naked?</v>

207
00:14:29.251 --> 00:14:32.790
<v Speaker 4>And there's a variety of complex quest </v>
<v Speaker 4>answers to that.</v>

208
00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:34.620
<v Speaker 4>One is that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

209
00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:35.753
<v Speaker 4>if you're naked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>common nightmares to be naked in front </v>

210
00:14:37.861 --> 00:14:38.694
<v Speaker 4>of a crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the reason that that's a nightmare </v>

211
00:14:40.501 --> 00:14:45.030
<v Speaker 4>is because while people don't like to </v>
<v Speaker 4>have their full vulnerability exposed to</v>

212
00:14:45.031 --> 00:14:49.080
<v Speaker 4>the judgmental I of the crowd and for </v>
<v Speaker 4>good reason like everybody has,</v>

213
00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:50.670
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what would you say?</v>

214
00:14:50.671 --> 00:14:51.504
<v Speaker 4>It may be inbuilt sense of shame about </v>
<v Speaker 4>their fundamental inadequacy in </v>

215
00:14:54.861 --> 00:14:57.410
<v Speaker 4>relationship to the difficulties of </v>
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

216
00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:02.030
<v Speaker 4>And so the story of Genesis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I think is a foundational story.</v>

217
00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:04.210
<v Speaker 4>Well I don't think it's a foundational </v>
<v Speaker 4>stories.</v>

218
00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:05.053
<v Speaker 4>Obviously a foundational story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>foundational story of Western culture </v>

219
00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:14.980
<v Speaker 4>suggest that it's mankind's knowledge of</v>
<v Speaker 4>its own nature that leads to not only to</v>

220
00:15:16.551 --> 00:15:18.330
<v Speaker 4>suffering but to work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

221
00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:19.183
<v Speaker 4>because once you realize that you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>vulnerable and that that vulnerability </v>

222
00:15:21.411 --> 00:15:22.244
<v Speaker 4>never really goes away,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you always have to prepare it for the </v>

223
00:15:24.381 --> 00:15:25.214
<v Speaker 4>future.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because even if you solve the problems </v>

224
00:15:26.901 --> 00:15:28.940
<v Speaker 4>that are right in front of you this </v>
<v Speaker 4>moment,</v>

225
00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:30.043
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't mean that you've solved the</v>
<v Speaker 4>plethora of problems that are likely to </v>

226
00:15:33.201 --> 00:15:35.930
<v Speaker 4>pop up for you tomorrow and next week,</v>
<v Speaker 4>next month,</v>

227
00:15:35.931 --> 00:15:37.140
<v Speaker 4>the next year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

228
00:15:37.141 --> 00:15:40.790
<v Speaker 4>and that in some sense are beyond your </v>
<v Speaker 4>ability to finally solve.</v>

229
00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:42.193
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's a different viewpoint I </v>

230
00:15:43.791 --> 00:15:46.520
<v Speaker 4>think that comes out of the Marxist </v>
<v Speaker 4>perspective.</v>

231
00:15:46.521 --> 00:15:50.000
<v Speaker 4>And I'm going to talk to you about </v>
<v Speaker 4>Marxism and postmodernism,</v>

232
00:15:50.001 --> 00:15:54.260
<v Speaker 4>both of which I regard as various </v>
<v Speaker 4>strands of the same ideology.</v>

233
00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:56.150
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and as I said,</v>

234
00:15:56.151 --> 00:15:59.190
<v Speaker 4>I'll define why I think are ideological.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the,</v>

235
00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:00.413
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the thing that strikes me so clearly </v>

236
00:16:02.091 --> 00:16:02.924
<v Speaker 4>about the Marxist perspective is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>the finger is always pointed at </v>

237
00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:09.830
<v Speaker 4>inadequate social order as the root </v>
<v Speaker 4>cause of suffering.</v>

238
00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:13.220
<v Speaker 4>And that just seems to me to be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

239
00:16:13.221 --> 00:16:14.054
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so naive that it's difficult to </v>

240
00:16:15.681 --> 00:16:17.870
<v Speaker 4>understand why people can possibly fall </v>
<v Speaker 4>for it.</v>

241
00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:20.780
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's partly because there's some </v>
<v Speaker 4>hope embedded in it,</v>

242
00:16:20.781 --> 00:16:21.850
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

243
00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:23.630
<v Speaker 4>there's an idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

244
00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:24.493
<v Speaker 4>suffering might be transcended if we </v>
<v Speaker 4>could just organize our societies </v>

245
00:16:26.781 --> 00:16:28.790
<v Speaker 4>properly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it seems to me,</v>

246
00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:30.860
<v Speaker 4>number one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that that's highly unlikely.</v>

247
00:16:30.861 --> 00:16:32.900
<v Speaker 4>A number two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as Dostoyevsky pointed out,</v>

248
00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:34.003
<v Speaker 4>even if we did organize our society so </v>
<v Speaker 4>that no one had anything to worry about </v>

249
00:16:36.981 --> 00:16:39.230
<v Speaker 4>from a material perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So everyone,</v>

250
00:16:39.231 --> 00:16:40.064
<v Speaker 4>let's say had enough bread and shelter </v>
<v Speaker 4>that we're the kind of insane creatures </v>

251
00:16:43.191 --> 00:16:48.191
<v Speaker 4>that would blow that apart and fragment </v>
<v Speaker 4>that sort of static utopian perfection.</v>

252
00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:51.170
<v Speaker 4>Just so something strange and </v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting might happen.</v>

253
00:16:51.171 --> 00:16:55.130
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's a really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a really devastating critique.</v>

254
00:16:55.131 --> 00:16:58.430
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the dusty ft formulated that back in the</v>

255
00:16:58.700 --> 00:16:59.533
<v Speaker 4>late 18 hundreds he had thought through </v>
<v Speaker 4>the consequences of communist utopia </v>

256
00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:06.470
<v Speaker 4>before it even manifested itself as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>political force.</v>

257
00:17:06.471 --> 00:17:10.760
<v Speaker 4>And I think put his finger on exactly at</v>
<v Speaker 4>least one of its primary weaknesses.</v>

258
00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:14.120
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we were delivered from suffering,</v>

259
00:17:14.121 --> 00:17:14.954
<v Speaker 4>it's not necessarily clear that we would</v>
<v Speaker 4>be happy about that because one of the </v>

260
00:17:17.721 --> 00:17:18.554
<v Speaker 4>things that does characterize human </v>
<v Speaker 4>beings is this intense desire for </v>

261
00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:24.230
<v Speaker 4>experience that transcends the </v>
<v Speaker 4>normative.</v>

262
00:17:24.231 --> 00:17:25.064
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and people will go out and look for </v>

263
00:17:26.151 --> 00:17:29.450
<v Speaker 4>difficult things to do just for the sake</v>
<v Speaker 4>of doing difficult things.</v>

264
00:17:29.451 --> 00:17:30.284
<v Speaker 4>They climb mountains and they engage in </v>
<v Speaker 4>extreme sports and they put their lives </v>

265
00:17:33.681 --> 00:17:34.514
<v Speaker 4>in danger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's no technical reason for </v>

266
00:17:36.621 --> 00:17:36.890
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

267
00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:37.723
<v Speaker 4>And it doesn't seem like a very </v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligent thing to do from the pure </v>

268
00:17:39.891 --> 00:17:43.910
<v Speaker 4>perspective of self preservation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But we're certainly cape capable of it.</v>

269
00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:48.590
<v Speaker 4>And the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Marxist seemed to lay the reason for</v>

270
00:17:48.591 --> 00:17:52.060
<v Speaker 4>suffering at the foot of inadequate </v>
<v Speaker 4>social structure.</v>

271
00:17:52.061 --> 00:17:53.520
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they go farther than that.</v>

272
00:17:53.521 --> 00:17:56.940
<v Speaker 4>They also described the social structure</v>
<v Speaker 4>as it exists.</v>

273
00:17:56.941 --> 00:17:57.774
<v Speaker 4>And this is where the idea of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>patriarchy is derived as far as I'm </v>

274
00:18:00.151 --> 00:18:03.570
<v Speaker 4>concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as something that is necessarily</v>

275
00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:10.110
<v Speaker 4>an upper class or an oppressive class </v>
<v Speaker 4>against the oppressed class and what the</v>

276
00:18:10.111 --> 00:18:10.944
<v Speaker 4>people who fit in those different </v>
<v Speaker 4>categories can vary with classic </v>

277
00:18:13.381 --> 00:18:16.140
<v Speaker 4>Marxism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was the rich against the poor,</v>

278
00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:17.550
<v Speaker 4>the poor against the rich,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

279
00:18:17.551 --> 00:18:20.010
<v Speaker 4>The bruce was he against the </v>
<v Speaker 4>proletariat.</v>

280
00:18:20.011 --> 00:18:20.844
<v Speaker 4>And that's being transformed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say by the postmodernists using </v>

281
00:18:24.571 --> 00:18:25.404
<v Speaker 4>a fairly self evident sleight of hand </v>
<v Speaker 4>into identity politics where the </v>

282
00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:32.333
<v Speaker 4>oppressed oppressor narrative just takes</v>
<v Speaker 4>different forms according to the </v>

283
00:18:38.311 --> 00:18:42.240
<v Speaker 4>identity that happens to be plugged into</v>
<v Speaker 4>the same mediational structure.</v>

284
00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:45.960
<v Speaker 4>And what seems to happen as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>consequence of that.</v>

285
00:18:45.961 --> 00:18:48.390
<v Speaker 4>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's pretty good data about this with</v>

286
00:18:48.391 --> 00:18:51.750
<v Speaker 4>regards to the Genesis of um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

287
00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:52.643
<v Speaker 4>intense intergroup conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the things that predicts intense </v>

288
00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:56.003
<v Speaker 4>intergroup conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the conflict in a Robonda and </v>

289
00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:00.240
<v Speaker 4>certainly also happened in Nazi Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that,</v>

290
00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:01.663
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>genocidal activities are often marketed </v>

291
00:19:05.311 --> 00:19:08.310
<v Speaker 4>as preemptive strikes against an </v>
<v Speaker 4>oppressor class,</v>

292
00:19:08.311 --> 00:19:09.144
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that would have been the Jews in </v>

293
00:19:09.901 --> 00:19:12.180
<v Speaker 4>Germany and in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in Rwanda,</v>

294
00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:14.640
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the same narrative emerged.</v>

295
00:19:14.641 --> 00:19:19.380
<v Speaker 4>It's very common to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to dichotomize this society as oppressor</v>

296
00:19:19.381 --> 00:19:20.214
<v Speaker 4>and oppressed and then for the oppressed</v>
<v Speaker 4>to rise up and take out the so called </v>

297
00:19:23.821 --> 00:19:24.654
<v Speaker 4>oppressors even before anything of any </v>
<v Speaker 4>of any particular violence occurs </v>

298
00:19:28.981 --> 00:19:29.814
<v Speaker 4>because of this enhanced sense of </v>
<v Speaker 4>victimization and the moral high ground </v>

299
00:19:33.391 --> 00:19:34.224
<v Speaker 4>that it seems to provide that logic </v>
<v Speaker 4>being something like if we're being </v>

300
00:19:37.531 --> 00:19:41.760
<v Speaker 4>oppressed and we have every right to </v>
<v Speaker 4>defend ourselves,</v>

301
00:19:41.761 --> 00:19:42.594
<v Speaker 4>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even against threats that are only in </v>

302
00:19:44.941 --> 00:19:46.590
<v Speaker 4>some way imaginary.</v>

303
00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:47.423
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to get too cut and dried </v>

304
00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:49.733
<v Speaker 4>about that because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it certainly is the case that there </v>

305
00:19:51.991 --> 00:19:56.040
<v Speaker 4>isn't a political or economic system in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the entire world that lacks corruption.</v>

306
00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:57.293
<v Speaker 4>And so the idea that this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the social structure is in part corrupt </v>

307
00:20:02.431 --> 00:20:03.264
<v Speaker 4>enough so that everyone who is embodied </v>
<v Speaker 4>in that social structure doesn't </v>

308
00:20:06.631 --> 00:20:10.040
<v Speaker 4>necessarily have an equal chance to </v>
<v Speaker 4>manifest their gifts.</v>

309
00:20:10.041 --> 00:20:10.874
<v Speaker 4>Say it rise to the top is certainly true</v>
<v Speaker 4>because human beings are completely </v>

310
00:20:14.071 --> 00:20:18.240
<v Speaker 4>incapable of producing perfect social </v>
<v Speaker 4>structures for a variety of reasons.</v>

311
00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:21.510
<v Speaker 4>Our own blindness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fact that we inherit structures that</v>

312
00:20:21.511 --> 00:20:25.110
<v Speaker 4>we don't really understand that are all </v>
<v Speaker 4>demanded in band in one way or another.</v>

313
00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:30.440
<v Speaker 4>And so there's always an element of </v>
<v Speaker 4>truth to critical claims that if we just</v>

314
00:20:30.901 --> 00:20:33.390
<v Speaker 4>got our act together better from a </v>
<v Speaker 4>social perspective,</v>

315
00:20:33.391 --> 00:20:35.310
<v Speaker 4>that everything would be more fair.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And just,</v>

316
00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:40.290
<v Speaker 4>but to say that is not too similar </v>
<v Speaker 4>caneously justify the claim that all the</v>

317
00:20:40.291 --> 00:20:41.124
<v Speaker 4>reasons that human beings are suffering </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that life is unfair and unjust is </v>

318
00:20:44.701 --> 00:20:48.160
<v Speaker 4>because the social structure is corrupt </v>
<v Speaker 4>and right.</v>

319
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:48.993
<v Speaker 4>You gotta think in multivariate terms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you have any degree of intelligence </v>

320
00:20:51.731 --> 00:20:52.564
<v Speaker 4>at all and for any complex phenomena,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's generally a multitude of causes </v>

321
00:20:56.621 --> 00:20:57.454
<v Speaker 4>and they are not easy to differentiate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's partly what's social </v>

322
00:21:01.001 --> 00:21:03.940
<v Speaker 4>scientist is do is to take a look at a </v>
<v Speaker 4>complex outcome.</v>

323
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:04.833
<v Speaker 4>Suffering certainly being one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and to look at the potential </v>

324
00:21:07.991 --> 00:21:08.824
<v Speaker 4>contributors of multitude of factors.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now it's very difficult cause those </v>

325
00:21:11.531 --> 00:21:15.880
<v Speaker 4>factors are not easy to categorize and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they overlap and so on and so forth.</v>

326
00:21:15.881 --> 00:21:20.881
<v Speaker 4>But you have to be pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what would you say,</v>

327
00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:26.440
<v Speaker 4>motivated and stupid?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say both at the same time,</v>

328
00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:30.460
<v Speaker 4>to use a univariate hypothesis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>two to co,</v>

329
00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:34.720
<v Speaker 4>two to account for a complex phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't care what the phenomena is.</v>

330
00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:35.943
<v Speaker 4>And so that's another hallmark of video </v>
<v Speaker 4>logical thinking is that the causal </v>

331
00:21:38.891 --> 00:21:41.320
<v Speaker 4>story collapses into a single dimension.</v>

332
00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:42.333
<v Speaker 4>You see that often in psychopathology to</v>
<v Speaker 4>where you know people who get obsessive </v>

333
00:21:46.301 --> 00:21:51.010
<v Speaker 4>about something can't shake like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>particular idea that possesses them.</v>

334
00:21:51.011 --> 00:21:55.240
<v Speaker 4>Paranoid people are like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And people who have eating disorders,</v>

335
00:21:55.241 --> 00:21:56.074
<v Speaker 4>especially anorexia like that is their </v>
<v Speaker 4>entire value structure collapses into </v>

336
00:21:59.531 --> 00:22:00.364
<v Speaker 4>the dimension of thin equals beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 4>and good and it's very rigid and black </v>

337
00:22:04.841 --> 00:22:07.060
<v Speaker 4>and white and it does the Mab solutely </v>
<v Speaker 4>no good.</v>

338
00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:12.730
<v Speaker 4>So now some of the problems with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with the Marxist perspective seems to be</v>

339
00:22:12.731 --> 00:22:16.040
<v Speaker 4>that um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>victim hood,</v>

340
00:22:16.041 --> 00:22:16.874
<v Speaker 4>that sense of enhanced victim hood tends</v>
<v Speaker 4>to produce an intense sense of </v>

341
00:22:19.211 --> 00:22:20.044
<v Speaker 4>resentment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's a very bad idea because </v>

342
00:22:21.431 --> 00:22:24.310
<v Speaker 4>resentment is a very toxic and violent </v>
<v Speaker 4>emotion.</v>

343
00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:25.473
<v Speaker 4>It's also very ungrateful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is one of the things I would </v>

344
00:22:27.251 --> 00:22:28.084
<v Speaker 4>really say about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially the radical left student </v>

345
00:22:30.221 --> 00:22:32.740
<v Speaker 4>types,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially at Ivy League universities.</v>

346
00:22:32.741 --> 00:22:33.574
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's really quite a spectacle to </v>
<v Speaker 4>see people at places like Yale come out </v>

347
00:22:38.021 --> 00:22:42.910
<v Speaker 4>and agitate as a consequence of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>realization of their own oppression when</v>

348
00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:46.150
<v Speaker 4>by any reasonable standard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>current or historical,</v>

349
00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:49.770
<v Speaker 4>they're probably in the top one 100th of</v>
<v Speaker 4>a percent,</v>

350
00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:50.673
<v Speaker 4>perhaps better than that of all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>people who have ever lived anywhere </v>

351
00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:55.173
<v Speaker 4>ever.</v>

352
00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:57.100
<v Speaker 4>And so it really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really,</v>

353
00:22:57.550 --> 00:22:58.383
<v Speaker 4>it's really quite staggering to me that </v>
<v Speaker 4>the top 0.001% can express their </v>

354
00:23:03.761 --> 00:23:04.594
<v Speaker 4>resentment about the top 0.0001% in such</v>
<v Speaker 4>strident terms without noticing that </v>

355
00:23:11.201 --> 00:23:16.201
<v Speaker 4>exactly the same claims of privilege </v>
<v Speaker 4>apply to them by as long as all you have</v>

356
00:23:16.751 --> 00:23:19.850
<v Speaker 4>to do is transform the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

357
00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:20.773
<v Speaker 4>the been in which you're doing the the </v>
<v Speaker 4>privilege comparisons and that becomes </v>

358
00:23:23.891 --> 00:23:26.200
<v Speaker 4>immediately self evident.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

359
00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:30.100
<v Speaker 4>the fact that as Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say hours North American since I'm</v>

360
00:23:30.101 --> 00:23:30.934
<v Speaker 4>a Canadian,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that were staggeringly privileged </v>

361
00:23:32.591 --> 00:23:35.440
<v Speaker 4>compared to the rest of the world is </v>
<v Speaker 4>certainly a consequence of the,</v>

362
00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:39.820
<v Speaker 4>of what you might describe as the </v>
<v Speaker 4>arbitrariness of our political borders.</v>

363
00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:41.103
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but to forget that when you're claiming </v>

364
00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:46.070
<v Speaker 4>a particular brand of oppression for </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself seems to me to be</v>

365
00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:50.390
<v Speaker 6>very ungrateful at the least.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And certainly motivated,</v>

366
00:23:50.391 --> 00:23:51.224
<v Speaker 6>let's say politically because I think it</v>
<v Speaker 6>justifies your expression of hatred for </v>

367
00:23:54.021 --> 00:23:58.280
<v Speaker 6>those that tiny fraction of people who </v>
<v Speaker 6>are still better off than you.</v>

368
00:23:58.580 --> 00:23:59.413
<v Speaker 6>And also a degree of historical </v>
<v Speaker 6>ignorance that's absolutely staggering </v>

369
00:24:02.331 --> 00:24:06.050
<v Speaker 6>in its magnitude and a complete </v>
<v Speaker 6>indictment of our education system,</v>

370
00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:09.050
<v Speaker 6>which should be indicted in every </v>
<v Speaker 6>possible way.</v>

371
00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:14.560
<v Speaker 6>So now the Marxists might claim to their</v>
<v Speaker 6>benefit,</v>

372
00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:20.980
<v Speaker 6>let's say</v>
<v Speaker 6>with this worldview of class struggle as</v>

373
00:24:21.861 --> 00:24:22.694
<v Speaker 6>being the primary driver of human </v>
<v Speaker 6>history and the well off </v>

374
00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:30.320
<v Speaker 6>socioeconomically because that's pretty </v>
<v Speaker 6>much the only way they defined well off,</v>

375
00:24:30.321 --> 00:24:31.154
<v Speaker 6>which is also something I take great </v>
<v Speaker 6>objection to because there's lots of </v>

376
00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:35.143
<v Speaker 6>hierarchies in the world and there are </v>
<v Speaker 6>many important hierarchies and not all </v>

377
00:24:39.111 --> 00:24:39.944
<v Speaker 6>of them can be reduced to socioeconomic </v>
<v Speaker 6>status by any stretch of the </v>

378
00:24:42.681 --> 00:24:43.514
<v Speaker 6>imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Imagine if you are 80 years old and you </v>

379
00:24:45.621 --> 00:24:47.240
<v Speaker 6>had $20 million,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

380
00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:48.283
<v Speaker 6>you might be perfectly happy to get rid </v>
<v Speaker 6>of all that money if you could be 18 </v>

381
00:24:51.231 --> 00:24:51.920
<v Speaker 6>again.</v>

382
00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:52.790
<v Speaker 6>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and you know,</v>

383
00:24:52.791 --> 00:24:53.624
<v Speaker 6>one of the best predictors of wealth in </v>
<v Speaker 6>North America is actually age because </v>

384
00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:58.153
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>young people haven't actually had much </v>

385
00:24:59.301 --> 00:25:00.134
<v Speaker 6>time to make money,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whereas old people have had quite a bit </v>

386
00:25:01.731 --> 00:25:02.564
<v Speaker 6>of time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But the problem with being old enriches </v>

387
00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:04.843
<v Speaker 6>that you're still old.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that actually turns out to be quite </v>

388
00:25:07.971 --> 00:25:11.210
<v Speaker 6>as serious problem because no matter how</v>
<v Speaker 6>rich you are,</v>

389
00:25:11.211 --> 00:25:12.044
<v Speaker 6>you eventually die and so the money is </v>
<v Speaker 6>the money has a very delimited if </v>

390
00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:18.013
<v Speaker 6>delimited effect with regards to </v>
<v Speaker 6>addressing the fundamental problems of </v>

391
00:25:21.351 --> 00:25:22.184
<v Speaker 6>the suffering of life and we know </v>
<v Speaker 6>perfectly well from the empirical </v>

392
00:25:25.011 --> 00:25:29.360
<v Speaker 6>perspective that once you have enough </v>
<v Speaker 6>money so that the bill collectors aren't</v>

393
00:25:29.361 --> 00:25:30.194
<v Speaker 6>chasing you around.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Essentially something like the </v>

394
00:25:32.391 --> 00:25:33.224
<v Speaker 6>beginnings of a middle class existence </v>
<v Speaker 6>or maybe the upper end of the working </v>

395
00:25:35.871 --> 00:25:39.740
<v Speaker 6>class than additional money has </v>
<v Speaker 6>absolutely no bearing whatsoever on your</v>

396
00:25:39.741 --> 00:25:40.574
<v Speaker 6>psychological wellbeing and that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>actually an indication of the </v>

397
00:25:43.071 --> 00:25:47.690
<v Speaker 6>limitations of material comfort,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let's say as a medication for the,</v>

398
00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:50.180
<v Speaker 6>for the suffering that's attended on </v>
<v Speaker 6>life.</v>

399
00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:51.043
<v Speaker 6>It's another thing that's very weak </v>
<v Speaker 6>about the Marxists and I think very </v>

400
00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:54.973
<v Speaker 6>interestingly contradictory because </v>
<v Speaker 6>they're very anticapitalist in their </v>

401
00:25:58.641 --> 00:25:59.474
<v Speaker 6>structure,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they're so damn materialistic that </v>

402
00:26:00.741 --> 00:26:04.670
<v Speaker 6>it's absolutely mind boggling because </v>
<v Speaker 6>the Marxists are actually more convinced</v>

403
00:26:04.671 --> 00:26:07.730
<v Speaker 6>that money is useful than most </v>
<v Speaker 6>capitalists as far as I can tell,</v>

404
00:26:07.731 --> 00:26:08.564
<v Speaker 6>because they believe that that money is </v>
<v Speaker 6>in fact the solution to all life's </v>

405
00:26:12.171 --> 00:26:13.004
<v Speaker 6>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The problem is is that just the right </v>

406
00:26:14.541 --> 00:26:15.374
<v Speaker 6>people don't have the money.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I think that's a staggeringly naive </v>

407
00:26:17.991 --> 00:26:22.340
<v Speaker 6>perspective because there's many,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's many problems in life that money</v>

408
00:26:22.341 --> 00:26:25.520
<v Speaker 6>just cannot solve and there's a fair </v>
<v Speaker 6>number of them in that it actually makes</v>

409
00:26:25.521 --> 00:26:28.370
<v Speaker 6>worse.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So anyways,</v>

410
00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:31.670
<v Speaker 6>having said all that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you could also still make the case.</v>

411
00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:36.780
<v Speaker 6>I used to work for a Socialist Party in </v>
<v Speaker 6>Canada when I was a kid about sixth bout</v>

412
00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:37.633
<v Speaker 6>time,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was 14 till the time I was about 17 </v>

413
00:26:39.411 --> 00:26:42.320
<v Speaker 6>before I figured out what was wrong.</v>

414
00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:46.080
<v Speaker 6>Not so much socialism per se,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but with ideology per se.</v>

415
00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:47.153
<v Speaker 6>And I actually admired the socialist </v>
<v Speaker 6>leaders that I had the fortune to be </v>

416
00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:52.103
<v Speaker 6>introduced to because at that point they</v>
<v Speaker 6>were very much a voice for the working </v>

417
00:26:57.331 --> 00:26:58.164
<v Speaker 6>class.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A lot of union leaders and people like </v>

418
00:26:59.311 --> 00:26:59.950
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

419
00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:03.490
<v Speaker 6>they're classic Democratic Socialists on</v>
<v Speaker 6>the Labor end of the distribution.</v>

420
00:27:03.491 --> 00:27:04.324
<v Speaker 6>And it's absolutely necessary for labor </v>
<v Speaker 6>and the working class to have a </v>

421
00:27:06.541 --> 00:27:07.374
<v Speaker 6>political voice,</v>
<v Speaker 6>something the Democrats might keep in </v>

422
00:27:09.331 --> 00:27:10.164
<v Speaker 6>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So when maybe they wouldn't lose their </v>

423
00:27:11.671 --> 00:27:15.480
<v Speaker 6>elections quite so frequently.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I really think it's appalling,</v>

424
00:27:15.481 --> 00:27:16.314
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because it's necessary for the working </v>

425
00:27:17.431 --> 00:27:18.264
<v Speaker 6>class to have a political voice.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So and to have that transformed into </v>

426
00:27:21.151 --> 00:27:24.150
<v Speaker 6>identity politics is a real catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Anyways.</v>

427
00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:25.133
<v Speaker 6>I think that the people that I met,</v>
<v Speaker 6>many of them were genuinely concerned </v>

428
00:27:29.611 --> 00:27:31.770
<v Speaker 6>with the problems of the working class </v>
<v Speaker 6>and you know,</v>

429
00:27:31.771 --> 00:27:32.760
<v Speaker 6>more power to them.</v>

430
00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:34.920
<v Speaker 6>And so I think there are people on the </v>
<v Speaker 6>left who,</v>

431
00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:36.143
<v Speaker 6>who genuinely are trying to make a </v>
<v Speaker 6>difference for people who could use a a </v>

432
00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:41.663
<v Speaker 6>fair shot at opportunity in life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But at the same time I noticed that a </v>

433
00:27:45.691 --> 00:27:49.260
<v Speaker 6>tremendous number of the p of especially</v>
<v Speaker 6>the lower and worker,</v>

434
00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:50.603
<v Speaker 6>a party worker protest or types were </v>
<v Speaker 6>more peevish and resentful than </v>

435
00:27:54.661 --> 00:27:55.494
<v Speaker 6>goodhearted and kind.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it was about that time that I came </v>

436
00:27:57.931 --> 00:28:02.931
<v Speaker 6>across George Orwell's famous critique </v>
<v Speaker 6>of left wing thinking and in the UK when</v>

437
00:28:04.021 --> 00:28:04.854
<v Speaker 6>in a book called road to Wigan Pier,</v>
<v Speaker 6>where he basically made the claim that </v>

438
00:28:07.890 --> 00:28:10.680
<v Speaker 6>the socialists that he knew,</v>
<v Speaker 6>especially the middle class ones,</v>

439
00:28:10.681 --> 00:28:13.620
<v Speaker 6>didn't give a damn about the poor.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They just hated the rich.</v>

440
00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:14.880
<v Speaker 6>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

441
00:28:14.881 --> 00:28:15.714
<v Speaker 6>that is something we're thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 6>for a very long period of time because </v>

442
00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:21.600
<v Speaker 6>hatred actually turns out to be a very </v>
<v Speaker 6>powerful motivation,</v>

443
00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:22.380
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

444
00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:23.213
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and if you think about the sorts of </v>

445
00:28:24.361 --> 00:28:25.194
<v Speaker 6>things that happened in the Soviet Union</v>
<v Speaker 6>and all these places that were supposed </v>

446
00:28:27.661 --> 00:28:29.070
<v Speaker 6>to be worker's Paradise,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>

447
00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:30.173
<v Speaker 6>if you look at the outcome and you had </v>
<v Speaker 6>to infer whether it was goodness of </v>

448
00:28:33.571 --> 00:28:34.404
<v Speaker 6>heart and kind heartedness and care for </v>
<v Speaker 6>the working man that produced the </v>

449
00:28:37.711 --> 00:28:40.320
<v Speaker 6>genocides or outright bitter,</v>
<v Speaker 6>resentful,</v>

450
00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:41.183
<v Speaker 6>resentment and hatred,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a lot easier to draw a causal path </v>

451
00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:46.260
<v Speaker 6>from the negative emotion to the </v>
<v Speaker 6>outcome.</v>

452
00:28:46.261 --> 00:28:49.710
<v Speaker 6>Then from the positive kind hearted </v>
<v Speaker 6>benevolence to that,</v>

453
00:28:49.711 --> 00:28:53.160
<v Speaker 6>you just don't get gulags out of </v>
<v Speaker 6>benevolence.</v>

454
00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:54.023
<v Speaker 6>That's just not how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I think the bloody historical </v>

455
00:28:56.581 --> 00:28:58.120
<v Speaker 6>evidence is clear.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

456
00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:01.320
<v Speaker 6>although I have read the most </v>
<v Speaker 6>convoluted,</v>

457
00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:03.870
<v Speaker 6>pathological,</v>
<v Speaker 6>pathetic,</v>

458
00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:07.120
<v Speaker 6>twisted rationalizations of what </v>
<v Speaker 6>happens,</v>

459
00:29:07.121 --> 00:29:10.890
<v Speaker 6>stay installing this Russia that you </v>
<v Speaker 6>could possibly manufacturer,</v>

460
00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:11.993
<v Speaker 6>it's as if an a stack of corpses that </v>
<v Speaker 6>would reach halfway to the moon isn't </v>

461
00:29:15.901 --> 00:29:19.470
<v Speaker 6>enough evidence for the pathology of a </v>
<v Speaker 6>certain form of belief.</v>

462
00:29:19.770 --> 00:29:23.070
<v Speaker 6>So some people can't be convinced by </v>
<v Speaker 6>anyone's death,</v>

463
00:29:23.071 --> 00:29:25.470
<v Speaker 6>but their own,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I suppose so.</v>

464
00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:30.840
<v Speaker 6>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>now I want to talk about postmodernism a</v>

465
00:29:30.841 --> 00:29:31.674
<v Speaker 6>little bit.</v>

466
00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:36.720
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it seems to me that's my Michel Foucault</v>

467
00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:39.090
<v Speaker 6>in the middle and a more reprehensible </v>
<v Speaker 6>individual.</v>

468
00:29:39.091 --> 00:29:39.924
<v Speaker 6>You could hardly ever discover or even </v>
<v Speaker 6>dream up no matter how twisted your </v>

469
00:29:44.411 --> 00:29:49.330
<v Speaker 6>imagination and Fuko and Dara dye would </v>
<v Speaker 6>say.</v>

470
00:29:49.331 --> 00:29:50.164
<v Speaker 6>There's more.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I would say they're the two </v>

471
00:29:51.341 --> 00:29:53.620
<v Speaker 6>architects of the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>of the,</v>

472
00:29:53.650 --> 00:29:56.230
<v Speaker 6>of the postmodernist movement.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And in brief,</v>

473
00:29:56.231 --> 00:29:57.064
<v Speaker 6>I think what they did was in the late </v>
<v Speaker 6>sixties and early seventies they were </v>

474
00:30:00.221 --> 00:30:01.054
<v Speaker 6>avowed Marxist some way,</v>
<v Speaker 6>lot way after anyone with any shred of </v>

475
00:30:05.801 --> 00:30:08.320
<v Speaker 6>ethical decency had stopped being a </v>
<v Speaker 6>Marxist.</v>

476
00:30:08.321 --> 00:30:09.154
<v Speaker 6>By that time,</v>
<v Speaker 6>even John Paul Sartre had woken up </v>

477
00:30:11.171 --> 00:30:15.220
<v Speaker 6>enough to figure out that the Soviets </v>
<v Speaker 6>hadn't ushered in the Kingdom of Heaven,</v>

478
00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:16.403
<v Speaker 6>know he had evidence stretching back 45 </v>
<v Speaker 6>years that he could have attended to if </v>

479
00:30:19.181 --> 00:30:20.830
<v Speaker 6>he would have been willing to open his </v>
<v Speaker 6>eyes,</v>

480
00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:23.870
<v Speaker 6>talk about bad faith,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which was his crutch,</v>

481
00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:25.550
<v Speaker 6>ethical critique,</v>
<v Speaker 6>essentially.</v>

482
00:30:25.551 --> 00:30:26.384
<v Speaker 6>It's something quite staggering.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The postmodernists knew that they were </v>

483
00:30:29.291 --> 00:30:30.124
<v Speaker 6>pretty much done with regards to pushing</v>
<v Speaker 6>their classic Marxism by the late </v>

484
00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:39.160
<v Speaker 6>sixties and early seventies because the </v>
<v Speaker 6>evidence that Stellan us Russia not only</v>

485
00:30:39.161 --> 00:30:39.994
<v Speaker 6>stalinists certainly lennon was no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no saint by any stretch of the </v>

486
00:30:43.121 --> 00:30:43.954
<v Speaker 6>imagination that the killing certainly </v>
<v Speaker 6>got underway while he was still alive </v>

487
00:30:46.841 --> 00:30:50.170
<v Speaker 6>and and continued after Stellan was dead</v>
<v Speaker 6>as well.</v>

488
00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:53.770
<v Speaker 6>Although perhaps with not the same </v>
<v Speaker 6>degree of brutality and efficiency.</v>

489
00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:56.950
<v Speaker 6>And then there is of course Maoist China</v>
<v Speaker 6>where the estimates,</v>

490
00:30:57.690 --> 00:30:58.523
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>nobody knows how many people died under </v>

491
00:30:59.801 --> 00:31:04.360
<v Speaker 6>Mao,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the estimates are run as high as 100</v>

492
00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:05.193
<v Speaker 6>million people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which actually turns out to be quite a </v>

493
00:31:06.731 --> 00:31:09.910
<v Speaker 6>few people in the fact that we can't </v>
<v Speaker 6>keep count accurately,</v>

494
00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:11.103
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>without an error margin of something in </v>

495
00:31:12.491 --> 00:31:16.540
<v Speaker 6>the tens of millions just tells you </v>
<v Speaker 6>exactly how horrible the situation was.</v>

496
00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:21.110
<v Speaker 6>They transformed the Marxist dialogue </v>
<v Speaker 6>of,</v>

497
00:31:21.290 --> 00:31:22.123
<v Speaker 6>of rich versus poor into oh pressed </v>
<v Speaker 6>versus oppressor and Fuko in particular </v>

498
00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:27.303
<v Speaker 6>who never fit in anywhere and who was an</v>
<v Speaker 6>outcast in many ways an a bitter one in </v>

499
00:31:30.341 --> 00:31:31.174
<v Speaker 6>as suicidal one his entire life did </v>
<v Speaker 6>everything he possibly could with is </v>

500
00:31:34.451 --> 00:31:35.284
<v Speaker 6>staggering Iq to figure out every </v>
<v Speaker 6>treacherous way possible to undermine </v>

501
00:31:38.651 --> 00:31:42.250
<v Speaker 6>the structure that wouldn't accept him </v>
<v Speaker 6>in all his peculiarity.</v>

502
00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:43.293
<v Speaker 6>And it's no wonder because there'd be no</v>
<v Speaker 6>way of making a structure that could </v>

503
00:31:45.761 --> 00:31:49.420
<v Speaker 6>possibly function if it was composed of </v>
<v Speaker 6>people who were as peculiar,</v>

504
00:31:49.421 --> 00:31:54.340
<v Speaker 6>bitter and resentful as Michel Fuko.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you couldn't imagine this functioning</v>

505
00:31:54.341 --> 00:31:57.790
<v Speaker 6>society that would be composed of </v>
<v Speaker 6>individuals with his particular makeup.</v>

506
00:31:58.240 --> 00:31:59.073
<v Speaker 6>In any case,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he did put his brain to work trying to </v>

507
00:32:01.571 --> 00:32:05.710
<v Speaker 6>figure out a way how to resurrect </v>
<v Speaker 6>Marxism under a new guys,</v>

508
00:32:05.711 --> 00:32:07.240
<v Speaker 6>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and B,</v>

509
00:32:07.450 --> 00:32:11.740
<v Speaker 6>how to justify the fact that it wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 6>his problem,</v>

510
00:32:11.741 --> 00:32:12.574
<v Speaker 6>that he was an outsider.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was actually everyone else's problem </v>

511
00:32:15.761 --> 00:32:19.480
<v Speaker 6>and he did a pretty damn good job of </v>
<v Speaker 6>that and laid the groundwork for this.</v>

512
00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:21.490
<v Speaker 6>For the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what would you call it,</v>

513
00:32:21.491 --> 00:32:22.324
<v Speaker 6>the rise of the marginalized against the</v>
<v Speaker 6>center and Darin is thinking is very </v>

514
00:32:26.471 --> 00:32:27.880
<v Speaker 6>much the same.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know dare.</v>

515
00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:28.983
<v Speaker 6>Even though Fuco and Derrida hated each </v>
<v Speaker 6>other and and regarded each other as </v>

516
00:32:32.711 --> 00:32:35.470
<v Speaker 6>intellectual charlatans,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which was about the only thing either of</v>

517
00:32:35.471 --> 00:32:38.410
<v Speaker 6>them was ever really correct about,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so</v>

518
00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:46.520
<v Speaker 6>Dara Dad was also an in some ways is </v>
<v Speaker 6>even more treacherous thinker because he</v>

519
00:32:46.821 --> 00:32:47.654
<v Speaker 6>makes the claim in some sense that I </v>
<v Speaker 6>think a political system has a center </v>

520
00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:54.260
<v Speaker 6>around which the majority congregate.</v>

521
00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:55.150
<v Speaker 6>Let's say it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

522
00:32:55.220 --> 00:33:00.050
<v Speaker 6>it's quite similar to two ficos analysis</v>
<v Speaker 6>and that there are,</v>

523
00:33:00.170 --> 00:33:03.920
<v Speaker 6>there are people who are outside the </v>
<v Speaker 6>category system and then,</v>

524
00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:08.240
<v Speaker 6>which is obviously true because no </v>
<v Speaker 6>matter how you categorize people,</v>

525
00:33:08.241 --> 00:33:11.240
<v Speaker 6>there are certain people inside the </v>
<v Speaker 6>category in certain people outside.</v>

526
00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:13.970
<v Speaker 6>That's actually why you categorize </v>
<v Speaker 6>things,</v>

527
00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:15.073
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because of every category holds every </v>

528
00:33:16.311 --> 00:33:18.380
<v Speaker 6>entity.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then every,</v>

529
00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:21.800
<v Speaker 6>every cognitive operation is infinitely </v>
<v Speaker 6>complex.</v>

530
00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:26.310
<v Speaker 6>You can't manage that way to categorize.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You have to include and exclude.</v>

531
00:33:26.311 --> 00:33:27.144
<v Speaker 6>It's in the very nature of </v>
<v Speaker 6>categorization and you can't just scrap </v>

532
00:33:29.991 --> 00:33:33.560
<v Speaker 6>categorization because without </v>
<v Speaker 6>simplification and categorization,</v>

533
00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:35.540
<v Speaker 6>you actually can't function in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>world.</v>

534
00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:37.310
<v Speaker 6>You just die,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

535
00:33:37.311 --> 00:33:38.144
<v Speaker 6>You die of excess stress.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's something like something like that </v>

536
00:33:40.551 --> 00:33:44.000
<v Speaker 6>happens to schizophrenia people because </v>
<v Speaker 6>their category systems breakdown,</v>

537
00:33:44.190 --> 00:33:45.023
<v Speaker 6>they're completely incapable of </v>
<v Speaker 6>functioning in the world as a </v>

538
00:33:46.671 --> 00:33:50.040
<v Speaker 6>consequence of that anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

539
00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:51.470
<v Speaker 6>then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

540
00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:52.333
<v Speaker 6>Derrida went and Fuko as well went a </v>
<v Speaker 6>step farther and this is one of the </v>

541
00:33:55.401 --> 00:33:57.560
<v Speaker 6>incredibly crooked elements of their </v>
<v Speaker 6>thinking.</v>

542
00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:01.130
<v Speaker 6>I think another slight of hand,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which was well category systems,</v>

543
00:34:01.131 --> 00:34:04.040
<v Speaker 6>exclude political systems,</v>
<v Speaker 6>exclude economic systems,</v>

544
00:34:04.041 --> 00:34:04.874
<v Speaker 6>exclude any hierarchy of value excludes </v>
<v Speaker 6>obviously because if there was a </v>

545
00:34:08.961 --> 00:34:09.794
<v Speaker 6>hierarchy of value,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some things are more valuable than </v>

546
00:34:11.451 --> 00:34:12.284
<v Speaker 6>others and the less valuable things are </v>
<v Speaker 6>excluded because otherwise it wouldn't </v>

547
00:34:15.171 --> 00:34:17.620
<v Speaker 6>be a hierarchy of value.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But the,</v>

548
00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:18.493
<v Speaker 6>the next claim they essentially make is </v>
<v Speaker 6>that the reason that those hierarchies </v>

549
00:34:21.261 --> 00:34:25.970
<v Speaker 6>of value are constructed isn't to </v>
<v Speaker 6>produce whatever it is that's a value,</v>

550
00:34:25.971 --> 00:34:26.804
<v Speaker 6>but to exclude and to maintain the </v>
<v Speaker 6>structure of power that's intrinsic to </v>

551
00:34:31.251 --> 00:34:33.660
<v Speaker 6>the hierarchy of value.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's a,</v>

552
00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:38.000
<v Speaker 6>that's an unbelievably crooked claim </v>
<v Speaker 6>because there are multiple reasons why a</v>

553
00:34:38.001 --> 00:34:40.330
<v Speaker 6>hierarchy of value might be put into </v>
<v Speaker 6>place there.</v>

554
00:34:40.430 --> 00:34:43.190
<v Speaker 6>Hierarchies of beauty and there's </v>
<v Speaker 6>hierarchies of competence,</v>

555
00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:46.700
<v Speaker 6>hierarchies of intelligence and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and attractiveness and,</v>

556
00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:51.380
<v Speaker 6>and athletic ability and musical talent.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's multiple hierarchies.</v>

557
00:34:51.381 --> 00:34:54.680
<v Speaker 6>And in order for those things to exist </v>
<v Speaker 6>at a high order,</v>

558
00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:56.480
<v Speaker 6>in order for us to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to,</v>

559
00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:57.940
<v Speaker 6>to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to laud,</v>

560
00:34:58.690 --> 00:34:59.600
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what would you say?</v>

561
00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:02.780
<v Speaker 6>Musical genius,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we have to excuse all the people.</v>

562
00:35:02.781 --> 00:35:03.614
<v Speaker 6>We have to exclude all the people who </v>
<v Speaker 6>can only squawk their clarinet from the </v>

563
00:35:07.071 --> 00:35:10.550
<v Speaker 6>hierarchy because otherwise you don't </v>
<v Speaker 6>have any music and there's no option,</v>

564
00:35:10.551 --> 00:35:11.384
<v Speaker 6>there's no direction.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so to claim that the purpose of the </v>

565
00:35:14.571 --> 00:35:18.230
<v Speaker 6>hierarchy is to exclude,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's unbelievably crooked and it's,</v>

566
00:35:18.231 --> 00:35:22.520
<v Speaker 6>it's central claim for both,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for both [inaudible] and Darin.</v>

567
00:35:22.521 --> 00:35:25.280
<v Speaker 6>It's one of those slights of hands that </v>
<v Speaker 6>people don't quite notice,</v>

568
00:35:25.281 --> 00:35:27.590
<v Speaker 6>but that have absolutely catastrophic </v>
<v Speaker 6>effects.</v>

569
00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:31.500
<v Speaker 6>Now for foucault and Derrida,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

570
00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:33.770
<v Speaker 6>you could,</v>
<v Speaker 6>here's how you could imagine their world</v>

571
00:35:33.771 --> 00:35:35.150
<v Speaker 6>essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

572
00:35:35.810 --> 00:35:36.561
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for the,</v>

573
00:35:36.561 --> 00:35:38.980
<v Speaker 6>for the philosopher Hobbes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

574
00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:41.220
<v Speaker 6>life was nasty,</v>
<v Speaker 6>brutish and short,</v>

575
00:35:41.221 --> 00:35:44.520
<v Speaker 6>and people were at each other's throats </v>
<v Speaker 6>in the state of nature,</v>

576
00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:47.520
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>But hubs really thought about that as a,</v>

577
00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:50.280
<v Speaker 6>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>as the chaos of individuals.</v>

578
00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:51.443
<v Speaker 6>And he believed that a central authority</v>
<v Speaker 6>had to exert force in order to organize </v>

579
00:35:55.261 --> 00:35:58.830
<v Speaker 6>that intrinsic chaos so that some degree</v>
<v Speaker 6>of peace could rate.</v>

580
00:35:58.950 --> 00:36:02.100
<v Speaker 6>It's kind of the opposite of John Shock </v>
<v Speaker 6>Russo's theory,</v>

581
00:36:02.101 --> 00:36:04.860
<v Speaker 6>which was that human beings were </v>
<v Speaker 6>intrinsically good and,</v>

582
00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:08.610
<v Speaker 6>and the state,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the government was intrinsically bad and</v>

583
00:36:08.611 --> 00:36:11.820
<v Speaker 6>that all of what made people evil derive</v>
<v Speaker 6>from the state.</v>

584
00:36:12.210 --> 00:36:13.043
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would say if you put hobbes and </v>

585
00:36:14.641 --> 00:36:17.130
<v Speaker 6>Rousseau together,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you actually get the truth,</v>

586
00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:18.413
<v Speaker 6>even though they do seem to be coming at</v>
<v Speaker 6>it from opposite perspectives because </v>

587
00:36:20.971 --> 00:36:21.804
<v Speaker 6>people are actually good and evil.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so social structures are also good </v>

588
00:36:25.261 --> 00:36:26.640
<v Speaker 6>and evil.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you know,</v>

589
00:36:26.641 --> 00:36:30.000
<v Speaker 6>it's paradoxical and we don't like </v>
<v Speaker 6>paradoxical categories,</v>

590
00:36:30.001 --> 00:36:31.940
<v Speaker 6>but that's still how it is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What,</v>

591
00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:35.760
<v Speaker 6>what foucault and Derrida and the </v>
<v Speaker 6>postmodernists did was that they kind of</v>

592
00:36:35.761 --> 00:36:36.594
<v Speaker 6>added the collective element to that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So they're hobbsy and world isn't a </v>

593
00:36:39.091 --> 00:36:39.924
<v Speaker 6>world of individuals struggling against </v>
<v Speaker 6>one another in the initial state of </v>

594
00:36:43.590 --> 00:36:44.910
<v Speaker 6>warlike nature.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

595
00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:45.983
<v Speaker 6>it's groups of individuals bound by </v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever their identity happens to be </v>

596
00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:53.280
<v Speaker 6>struggling against each,</v>
<v Speaker 6>each other for power.</v>

597
00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:56.310
<v Speaker 6>Because in the postmodern,</v>
<v Speaker 6>neo Marxist universe,</v>

598
00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:57.173
<v Speaker 6>there's nothing but power.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And there's a variety of reasons for </v>

599
00:37:00.121 --> 00:37:00.954
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Partly it's because the postmodernists </v>

600
00:37:03.661 --> 00:37:07.560
<v Speaker 6>don't admit that there are any standards</v>
<v Speaker 6>outside of arbitrary opinion.</v>

601
00:37:07.930 --> 00:37:08.763
<v Speaker 6>Essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They don't really believe in the real </v>

602
00:37:10.321 --> 00:37:12.720
<v Speaker 6>world,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is why they can generate critiques</v>

603
00:37:12.721 --> 00:37:13.980
<v Speaker 6>of science,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for example,</v>

604
00:37:13.981 --> 00:37:14.814
<v Speaker 6>which is increasingly characterized is </v>
<v Speaker 6>nothing but part of the euro centric </v>

605
00:37:18.481 --> 00:37:19.314
<v Speaker 6>patriarchies um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what would you call desire to impose </v>

606
00:37:22.081 --> 00:37:22.914
<v Speaker 6>their power structure on the rest of the</v>
<v Speaker 6>world despite the fact that it also </v>

607
00:37:25.771 --> 00:37:28.520
<v Speaker 6>makes planes fly in computers operate </v>
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

608
00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:30.120
<v Speaker 6>and well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

609
00:37:30.270 --> 00:37:31.710
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>exactly.</v>

610
00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:34.230
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and it's a rare bloody,</v>

611
00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:37.650
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>social justice warrior that doesn't have</v>

612
00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:38.993
<v Speaker 6>an iphone or a android that wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 6>work if quantum mechanics wasn't </v>

613
00:37:42.181 --> 00:37:43.014
<v Speaker 6>actually correct.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because the fact that quantum matt </v>

614
00:37:45.371 --> 00:37:48.720
<v Speaker 6>mechanics is correct is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>reasons why these unbelievably,</v>

615
00:37:48.730 --> 00:37:52.000
<v Speaker 6>highly developed pieces of technology </v>
<v Speaker 6>actually function.</v>

616
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.990
<v Speaker 6>So they bitch and whine about the </v>
<v Speaker 6>patriarchal,</v>

617
00:37:55.290 --> 00:38:00.150
<v Speaker 6>patriarchal underpinnings of Eurocentric</v>
<v Speaker 6>Science and use the gadgets all the time</v>

618
00:38:00.151 --> 00:38:02.040
<v Speaker 6>to aggregate,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to complain about it.</v>

619
00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:05.880
<v Speaker 6>So it's really pretty appalling.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So anyways,</v>

620
00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:07.770
<v Speaker 6>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the worldview of the,</v>

621
00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:08.693
<v Speaker 6>of the postmodern neo marxists is that </v>
<v Speaker 6>everybody is basically not an </v>

622
00:38:12.181 --> 00:38:13.370
<v Speaker 6>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

623
00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:17.790
<v Speaker 6>cause that's really a fiction and a </v>
<v Speaker 6>eurocentric patriarchal fiction at that,</v>

624
00:38:17.791 --> 00:38:20.970
<v Speaker 6>but a member of whatever their identity </v>
<v Speaker 6>group happens to be.</v>

625
00:38:20.971 --> 00:38:25.380
<v Speaker 6>And there's no real possibility of </v>
<v Speaker 6>communication between identity groups,</v>

626
00:38:25.381 --> 00:38:28.290
<v Speaker 6>hence phenomena like cultural </v>
<v Speaker 6>appropriation.</v>

627
00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:29.513
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and so it's a war of all groups against </v>

628
00:38:32.041 --> 00:38:32.874
<v Speaker 6>all groups and it's all,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's nothing but a struggle for power </v>

629
00:38:34.930 --> 00:38:35.763
<v Speaker 6>and there's no higher order ethic to be </v>
<v Speaker 6>referred to because for the </v>

630
00:38:39.281 --> 00:38:41.230
<v Speaker 6>postmodernists,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

631
00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:43.390
<v Speaker 6>there is no such thing as a higher order</v>
<v Speaker 6>ethic.</v>

632
00:38:43.391 --> 00:38:45.460
<v Speaker 6>There is no such thing as a uniting </v>
<v Speaker 6>narrative.</v>

633
00:38:45.461 --> 00:38:47.800
<v Speaker 6>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's a hallmark of their thinking.</v>

634
00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:48.633
<v Speaker 6>Now of course,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that doesn't work out in practice </v>

635
00:38:49.961 --> 00:38:52.780
<v Speaker 6>because without an ethic or a higher </v>
<v Speaker 6>order value,</v>

636
00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:54.093
<v Speaker 6>there isn't anything you can do with </v>
<v Speaker 6>your life because you keep undermining </v>

637
00:38:56.351 --> 00:38:59.080
<v Speaker 6>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If everything's just a women subjective,</v>

638
00:38:59.081 --> 00:39:02.710
<v Speaker 6>there's and there's no hierarchy of </v>
<v Speaker 6>values than what the hell do you do when</v>

639
00:39:02.711 --> 00:39:03.544
<v Speaker 6>you get up in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If one thing isn't better than the </v>

640
00:39:05.801 --> 00:39:06.634
<v Speaker 6>other,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you might as well just lay there and </v>

641
00:39:07.601 --> 00:39:08.434
<v Speaker 6>smother yourself with a pillow would be </v>
<v Speaker 6>a lot easier than opening your eyes and </v>

642
00:39:11.261 --> 00:39:15.160
<v Speaker 6>struggling in the world so so it's </v>
<v Speaker 6>completely,</v>

643
00:39:15.250 --> 00:39:19.450
<v Speaker 6>it's a self defeating philosophy and I </v>
<v Speaker 6>think that's part of the reason why it's</v>

644
00:39:19.451 --> 00:39:20.284
<v Speaker 6>more or less self evident that it's a </v>
<v Speaker 6>mask for the continuation of Marxism </v>

645
00:39:23.561 --> 00:39:27.850
<v Speaker 6>because at least Marxism has as one of </v>
<v Speaker 6>its advantages at direction.</v>

646
00:39:27.851 --> 00:39:28.840
<v Speaker 6>It's an ethic,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

647
00:39:28.841 --> 00:39:29.674
<v Speaker 6>You have something to struggle against </v>
<v Speaker 6>even though what you're struggling </v>

648
00:39:31.481 --> 00:39:35.620
<v Speaker 6>against is certainly one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 6>that you actually rely on and second,</v>

649
00:39:35.621 --> 00:39:36.454
<v Speaker 6>something that you have to oversimplify </v>
<v Speaker 6>in a very ungrateful and resentful way </v>

650
00:39:40.421 --> 00:39:43.240
<v Speaker 6>to justify fighting against it to begin </v>
<v Speaker 6>with.</v>

651
00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:47.620
<v Speaker 6>And that's especially true in western </v>
<v Speaker 6>cultures because as pathological as they</v>

652
00:39:47.621 --> 00:39:48.454
<v Speaker 6>certainly are,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is approximately as pathological </v>

653
00:39:50.381 --> 00:39:51.214
<v Speaker 6>as all of you are,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there are a lot less pathological than </v>

654
00:39:53.351 --> 00:39:54.184
<v Speaker 6>almost everything that's ever happened </v>
<v Speaker 6>and pretty much everything that's </v>

655
00:39:57.611 --> 00:39:59.530
<v Speaker 6>currently happening elsewhere in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>world.</v>

656
00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:00.543
<v Speaker 6>And you can kind of tell that by the </v>
<v Speaker 6>fact that people tend to come to </v>

657
00:40:02.861 --> 00:40:05.320
<v Speaker 6>immigrate to the West rather than the </v>
<v Speaker 6>reverse.</v>

658
00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:06.430
<v Speaker 6>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

659
00:40:06.430 --> 00:40:09.010
<v Speaker 6>the postmodern neo Marxists would have </v>
<v Speaker 6>an answer to that,</v>

660
00:40:09.011 --> 00:40:09.844
<v Speaker 6>which would be the only reason the west </v>
<v Speaker 6>functions is cause it's raped the rest </v>

661
00:40:12.461 --> 00:40:14.770
<v Speaker 6>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>of humanity and the planet.</v>

662
00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:19.800
<v Speaker 6>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the less said about that,</v>

663
00:40:20.021 --> 00:40:25.021
<v Speaker 6>the better.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And Marx was wrong about this too.</v>

664
00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:28.640
<v Speaker 6>The proletarians have nothing to lose,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but our chains,</v>

665
00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:31.940
<v Speaker 6>that actually wasn't true.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They lost their food.</v>

666
00:40:33.610 --> 00:40:36.480
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

667
00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:39.780
<v Speaker 6>You might see that happening again in </v>
<v Speaker 6>Venezuela where they,</v>

668
00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:40.703
<v Speaker 6>where they're having a hard time in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>middle class are having a hard time </v>

669
00:40:43.081 --> 00:40:43.914
<v Speaker 6>getting toilet paper,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which has a lot less funny than it </v>

670
00:40:45.451 --> 00:40:48.510
<v Speaker 6>sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They lost their families.</v>

671
00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:50.340
<v Speaker 6>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They lost their land.</v>

672
00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:54.570
<v Speaker 6>They lost their freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They lost.</v>

673
00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:58.410
<v Speaker 6>They lost their right to exist without </v>
<v Speaker 6>pain.</v>

674
00:40:58.710 --> 00:41:02.520
<v Speaker 6>They lost the right to honestly suffer </v>
<v Speaker 6>and talk about it,</v>

675
00:41:02.521 --> 00:41:04.710
<v Speaker 6>which is a terrible thing to lose,</v>
<v Speaker 6>lose.</v>

676
00:41:04.711 --> 00:41:08.400
<v Speaker 6>And then they lost their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So that was wrong.</v>

677
00:41:08.730 --> 00:41:12.300
<v Speaker 6>And he can smile all you want about it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But it wasn't very cute.</v>

678
00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:14.700
<v Speaker 6>This is nice.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I saw this on twitter today.</v>

679
00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:15.713
<v Speaker 6>When Karl Marx died in 1883 the average </v>
<v Speaker 6>Englishman was three times richer than </v>

680
00:41:19.801 --> 00:41:24.801
<v Speaker 6>he was when weren't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Mark's was born in 1818 that's world GDP</v>

681
00:41:24.841 --> 00:41:28.290
<v Speaker 6>per person in 19 1990 international </v>
<v Speaker 6>dollars.</v>

682
00:41:28.291 --> 00:41:30.990
<v Speaker 6>And you'll see that there's an </v>
<v Speaker 6>unbelievable spike.</v>

683
00:41:30.990 --> 00:41:33.950
<v Speaker 6>And it happened at about 1895 was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let's,</v>

684
00:41:33.951 --> 00:41:34.784
<v Speaker 6>let's put it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was precisely and exactly the </v>

685
00:41:38.211 --> 00:41:41.240
<v Speaker 6>opposite of what the Marxists predicted.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But you know,</v>

686
00:41:41.241 --> 00:41:43.400
<v Speaker 6>when your predictions fail and you're an</v>
<v Speaker 6>idiot log,</v>

687
00:41:43.401 --> 00:41:44.234
<v Speaker 6>you just gerrymander the axioms of your </v>
<v Speaker 6>theory because otherwise you'd have to </v>

688
00:41:47.181 --> 00:41:48.014
<v Speaker 6>drop the damn thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then you're plunged into a state of </v>

689
00:41:50.391 --> 00:41:52.700
<v Speaker 6>existential chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is no joke.</v>

690
00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:56.090
<v Speaker 6>And you have to reformulate yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you know,</v>

691
00:41:56.110 --> 00:41:56.943
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you don't want to underestimate the </v>

692
00:41:57.681 --> 00:41:59.240
<v Speaker 6>difficulty of doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But,</v>

693
00:41:59.830 --> 00:42:00.663
<v Speaker 6>but it's still relatively amusing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>especially when you consider that that </v>

694
00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:05.653
<v Speaker 6>unbelievable increase in gross domestic </v>
<v Speaker 6>product per person actually happened </v>

695
00:42:09.381 --> 00:42:14.090
<v Speaker 6>despite the best efforts of the Marxists</v>
<v Speaker 6>to prevent it from happening.</v>

696
00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:15.193
<v Speaker 6>And so God only knows we were,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we would be if 120 million people </v>

697
00:42:18.891 --> 00:42:19.724
<v Speaker 6>weren't sacrificed painfully and </v>
<v Speaker 6>pointlessly in the 20th century to this </v>

698
00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:26.150
<v Speaker 6>idiot God of socialist utopia.</v>

699
00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:29.270
<v Speaker 6>It was turned out to be murderous beyond</v>
<v Speaker 6>comprehension,</v>

700
00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:34.190
<v Speaker 6>postmodernism and attitude of </v>
<v Speaker 6>skepticism,</v>

701
00:42:34.490 --> 00:42:37.590
<v Speaker 6>irony toward a skepticism towards </v>
<v Speaker 6>everything.</v>

702
00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:38.503
<v Speaker 6>But postmodernism,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I might add irony toward rejection of </v>

703
00:42:41.931 --> 00:42:42.764
<v Speaker 6>grand narratives.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a lot bigger a problem than you </v>

704
00:42:44.751 --> 00:42:49.130
<v Speaker 6>think because actually the things that </v>
<v Speaker 6>unite people are grand narratives.</v>

705
00:42:49.131 --> 00:42:50.360
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a narrative is a,</v>

706
00:42:50.610 --> 00:42:54.350
<v Speaker 6>as a cognitive structure that orients </v>
<v Speaker 6>you towards an ideal.</v>

707
00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:55.820
<v Speaker 6>That's what a narrative is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

708
00:42:55.821 --> 00:42:57.830
<v Speaker 6>if you go see a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is a narrative,</v>

709
00:42:58.010 --> 00:43:00.050
<v Speaker 6>the hero is up to something.</v>
<v Speaker 6>First of all,</v>

710
00:43:00.051 --> 00:43:02.270
<v Speaker 6>there is a hero because why the hell go </v>
<v Speaker 6>to the movie?</v>

711
00:43:02.271 --> 00:43:05.990
<v Speaker 6>Otherwise you don't want to watch a </v>
<v Speaker 6>bunch of people bumble around randomly.</v>

712
00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:08.120
<v Speaker 6>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're not interested in that at all.</v>

713
00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:11.150
<v Speaker 6>You want to see someone who has a </v>
<v Speaker 6>problem to solve and who at,</v>

714
00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:14.120
<v Speaker 6>who's applying an ethic to the solution </v>
<v Speaker 6>of that problem.</v>

715
00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:16.530
<v Speaker 6>It can be a bad ethnic.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That would be an Antihero,</v>

716
00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:18.170
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Could be a pathological ethic.</v>

717
00:43:18.290 --> 00:43:21.770
<v Speaker 6>That's a good object lesson anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's certainly an ethic.</v>

718
00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:26.930
<v Speaker 6>And so it's grand narratives that unite </v>
<v Speaker 6>people and when the postmodernist become</v>

719
00:43:26.931 --> 00:43:27.764
<v Speaker 6>skeptical about the grand narrative is </v>
<v Speaker 6>what that essentially means is that </v>

720
00:43:30.351 --> 00:43:33.410
<v Speaker 6>they're demolishing the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the hyper truths.</v>

721
00:43:33.411 --> 00:43:35.420
<v Speaker 6>I would say the fictions,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

722
00:43:35.421 --> 00:43:35.960
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

723
00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:36.793
<v Speaker 6>the true fictions that unite us as </v>
<v Speaker 6>people and stop us from being at each </v>

724
00:43:40.431 --> 00:43:45.431
<v Speaker 6>other's throats,</v>
<v Speaker 6>enable us to compete and to cooperate in</v>

725
00:43:45.681 --> 00:43:48.620
<v Speaker 6>a peaceful and productive manner,</v>
<v Speaker 6>at least some of the time,</v>

726
00:43:48.621 --> 00:43:52.460
<v Speaker 6>which is a miracle in and of itself and </v>
<v Speaker 6>should be regarded as such.</v>

727
00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:53.361
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

728
00:43:53.361 --> 00:43:54.194
<v Speaker 6>we're so blind in the west to the </v>
<v Speaker 6>miraculous nature of our culture that </v>

729
00:43:57.910 --> 00:43:58.671
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

730
00:43:58.671 --> 00:44:01.520
<v Speaker 6>it's a consequence of being privileged,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let's say.</v>

731
00:44:01.521 --> 00:44:04.370
<v Speaker 6>Although I hate that word,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we could call it fortunate.</v>

732
00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:05.563
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when I am in Herzliya leak came to </v>

733
00:44:07.551 --> 00:44:08.384
<v Speaker 6>Holland,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one of the things that's really struck </v>

734
00:44:09.381 --> 00:44:11.830
<v Speaker 6>me when I read her book infidel,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

735
00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:17.680
<v Speaker 6>she was very taken aback by the fact </v>
<v Speaker 6>that you could stop by a bus,</v>

736
00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:20.623
<v Speaker 6>a bus stop,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and there'd be a little digital display </v>

737
00:44:22.881 --> 00:44:23.714
<v Speaker 6>there that said when the bus was coming </v>
<v Speaker 6>and when the digital display said the </v>

738
00:44:27.471 --> 00:44:28.304
<v Speaker 6>bus was coming,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then the bus would show up and she just </v>

739
00:44:30.501 --> 00:44:31.334
<v Speaker 6>couldn't accustom yourself to that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was like an existential produced </v>

740
00:44:34.531 --> 00:44:35.364
<v Speaker 6>existential terror.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it's no wonder because you just </v>

741
00:44:37.801 --> 00:44:39.990
<v Speaker 6>think about how bloody impossible that </v>
<v Speaker 6>is.</v>

742
00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:43.200
<v Speaker 6>That's impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean the Dutch could manage it because</v>

743
00:44:43.201 --> 00:44:43.981
<v Speaker 6>they manage,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

744
00:44:43.981 --> 00:44:46.140
<v Speaker 6>a dozen impossible things before </v>
<v Speaker 6>breakfast.</v>

745
00:44:46.141 --> 00:44:48.930
<v Speaker 6>They live under water for God's sake.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

746
00:44:49.650 --> 00:44:50.483
<v Speaker 6>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she was also absolutely amazed that you </v>

747
00:44:52.651 --> 00:44:56.340
<v Speaker 6>could go ask policemen for help and they</v>
<v Speaker 6>wouldn't just hurt you and take all your</v>

748
00:44:56.341 --> 00:44:56.970
<v Speaker 6>money.</v>

749
00:44:56.970 --> 00:44:59.070
<v Speaker 6>And that is also another form of </v>
<v Speaker 6>miracle.</v>

750
00:44:59.071 --> 00:45:00.990
<v Speaker 6>The kind of thing that we just take for </v>
<v Speaker 6>granted,</v>

751
00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:05.010
<v Speaker 6>skepticism towards ideologies and </v>
<v Speaker 6>universalism.</v>

752
00:45:05.011 --> 00:45:06.990
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we can scrap the ideology part,</v>

753
00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:10.080
<v Speaker 6>including objective notions of reason,</v>
<v Speaker 6>human nature,</v>

754
00:45:10.081 --> 00:45:11.970
<v Speaker 6>social progress,</v>
<v Speaker 6>absolute truth,</v>

755
00:45:11.971 --> 00:45:15.750
<v Speaker 6>and objective reality.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it's an unbelievably corrosive,</v>

756
00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:20.160
<v Speaker 6>it's an unbelievably corrosive system of</v>
<v Speaker 6>thought because first of all,</v>

757
00:45:20.161 --> 00:45:23.910
<v Speaker 6>it defines hierarchy as power.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's actually technically wrong.</v>

758
00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:24.863
<v Speaker 6>Even friends to wall who's been studying</v>
<v Speaker 6>chimpanzee hierarchies has established </v>

759
00:45:28.411 --> 00:45:29.244
<v Speaker 6>quite clearly that the most brutal and </v>
<v Speaker 6>powerful Elfa chimp is not the one who </v>

760
00:45:33.511 --> 00:45:36.350
<v Speaker 6>establishes the most stable dominance </v>
<v Speaker 6>hierarchies,</v>

761
00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:37.293
<v Speaker 6>or let's call them social hierarchies </v>
<v Speaker 6>because the brutal tyrant chimp gets </v>

762
00:45:41.011 --> 00:45:45.180
<v Speaker 6>torn apart by two subordinate chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 6>three quarters as strong as him.</v>

763
00:45:45.181 --> 00:45:46.014
<v Speaker 6>As soon as he turns a blind eye,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the more stable hierarchies even among </v>

764
00:45:49.351 --> 00:45:51.030
<v Speaker 6>chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 6>are ones that are,</v>

765
00:45:51.330 --> 00:45:53.100
<v Speaker 6>that are governed by someone.</v>

766
00:45:53.130 --> 00:45:53.963
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when a chimp that's got some physical </v>

767
00:45:55.351 --> 00:45:56.184
<v Speaker 6>power in some capacity for intimidation,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but who's perfectly capable of </v>

768
00:45:59.371 --> 00:46:00.204
<v Speaker 6>establishing reciprocal relationships </v>
<v Speaker 6>with other male and female chimps so </v>

769
00:46:03.901 --> 00:46:06.150
<v Speaker 6>that he's got friends and allies around </v>
<v Speaker 6>them,</v>

770
00:46:06.151 --> 00:46:08.370
<v Speaker 6>it stabilizes it's rules,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so to speak.</v>

771
00:46:08.371 --> 00:46:13.140
<v Speaker 6>So the idea that hierarchies in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in functioning societies are primarily a</v>

772
00:46:13.141 --> 00:46:16.530
<v Speaker 6>consequence of power,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is cynical beyond belief,</v>

773
00:46:16.531 --> 00:46:19.110
<v Speaker 6>apart from being wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

774
00:46:19.530 --> 00:46:22.800
<v Speaker 6>and it also destroys the idea of a </v>
<v Speaker 6>hierarchy of competence,</v>

775
00:46:22.801 --> 00:46:23.634
<v Speaker 6>which I really think is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>reasons for the theory to begin with </v>

776
00:46:27.031 --> 00:46:31.080
<v Speaker 6>because we know even from the empirical </v>
<v Speaker 6>data that in Western societies,</v>

777
00:46:31.081 --> 00:46:33.570
<v Speaker 6>the best two predictors of longterm life</v>
<v Speaker 6>success,</v>

778
00:46:33.571 --> 00:46:34.404
<v Speaker 6>our intelligence and conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and they do a pretty good job of </v>

779
00:46:38.641 --> 00:46:39.474
<v Speaker 6>predicting longterm life success </v>
<v Speaker 6>accounting for about 25 to 30% of the </v>

780
00:46:42.271 --> 00:46:43.104
<v Speaker 6>variance,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is a lot by social science </v>

781
00:46:44.611 --> 00:46:45.444
<v Speaker 6>standards and it's kind of a testament </v>
<v Speaker 6>to the integrity of our societies that </v>

782
00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:52.770
<v Speaker 6>complex jobs tend to be filled by </v>
<v Speaker 6>intelligent,</v>

783
00:46:52.771 --> 00:46:53.604
<v Speaker 6>hardworking people and thank God for </v>
<v Speaker 6>that because who the hell do you want </v>

784
00:46:56.461 --> 00:46:57.294
<v Speaker 6>running them?</v>

785
00:46:57.360 --> 00:46:59.400
<v Speaker 6>You don't want to be doing that </v>
<v Speaker 6>randomly.</v>

786
00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:00.293
<v Speaker 6>Most of those things are incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 6>complex and difficult and so you better </v>

787
00:47:02.791 --> 00:47:03.624
<v Speaker 6>have disciplined people who were willing</v>
<v Speaker 6>to work 60 hours a week and who are </v>

788
00:47:07.561 --> 00:47:08.394
<v Speaker 6>super smart governing those things are,</v>
<v Speaker 6>or the lights go off and they should be </v>

789
00:47:11.251 --> 00:47:14.520
<v Speaker 6>off right now because it's impossible to</v>
<v Speaker 6>keep a power grid functioning.</v>

790
00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:15.593
<v Speaker 6>It's not like it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not like entropy isn't trying to </v>

791
00:47:17.911 --> 00:47:20.490
<v Speaker 6>tear it to bits at every second,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

792
00:47:20.491 --> 00:47:21.324
<v Speaker 6>There are thousands of people out there </v>
<v Speaker 6>working madly to stop this thing from </v>

793
00:47:24.601 --> 00:47:27.150
<v Speaker 6>doing what it should be doing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is to fail.</v>

794
00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:30.430
<v Speaker 6>And so competence is everywhere and it's</v>
<v Speaker 6>abs.</v>

795
00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:31.293
<v Speaker 6>I mean you think about how many </v>
<v Speaker 6>competent people have to be working </v>

796
00:47:33.581 --> 00:47:36.130
<v Speaker 6>behind the scenes so that you can all </v>
<v Speaker 6>come here,</v>

797
00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:37.173
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in your leisure fundamentally and sit </v>

798
00:47:39.041 --> 00:47:41.200
<v Speaker 6>for two hours peacefully in a lecture.</v>

799
00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:42.033
<v Speaker 6>It's absolutely beyond belief.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I think that they were after the </v>

800
00:47:45.641 --> 00:47:48.490
<v Speaker 6>destruction of the idea of competence </v>
<v Speaker 6>itself and we're getting,</v>

801
00:47:48.491 --> 00:47:49.324
<v Speaker 6>we're walking down that road very,</v>
<v Speaker 6>very rapidly as well as trying to </v>

802
00:47:52.091 --> 00:47:55.300
<v Speaker 6>destroy the idea of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's part of the,</v>

803
00:47:55.660 --> 00:47:57.460
<v Speaker 6>what would you call it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the attempt to,</v>

804
00:47:57.820 --> 00:48:01.630
<v Speaker 6>to insist that there's no such thing </v>
<v Speaker 6>outside the text,</v>

805
00:48:01.631 --> 00:48:03.700
<v Speaker 6>which was one of Derrida's great </v>
<v Speaker 6>statements.</v>

806
00:48:03.701 --> 00:48:04.534
<v Speaker 6>There's no such thing outside the text.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And what he meant by that in some sense </v>

807
00:48:07.211 --> 00:48:11.320
<v Speaker 6>was everything is interpretation and </v>
<v Speaker 6>there is a manner in which that's true,</v>

808
00:48:11.321 --> 00:48:14.520
<v Speaker 6>but it's not the kind of final truth </v>
<v Speaker 6>that the postmodernists likes.</v>

809
00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:15.453
<v Speaker 6>Like to think it is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there are a little too tangled up in </v>

810
00:48:17.501 --> 00:48:19.030
<v Speaker 6>language.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

811
00:48:19.530 --> 00:48:24.530
<v Speaker 6>and that's not a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So here's where we're at with regards to</v>

812
00:48:26.021 --> 00:48:26.854
<v Speaker 6>the um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to the spread of postmodern neo Marxist </v>

813
00:48:30.161 --> 00:48:30.670
<v Speaker 6>ideas.</v>

814
00:48:30.670 --> 00:48:31.780
<v Speaker 6>And these are,</v>
<v Speaker 6>see,</v>

815
00:48:31.781 --> 00:48:32.614
<v Speaker 6>I've been trying,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know how you can identify the right </v>

816
00:48:35.321 --> 00:48:36.154
<v Speaker 6>wingers you don't want to hang around </v>
<v Speaker 6>with because they talk about white </v>

817
00:48:38.381 --> 00:48:40.960
<v Speaker 6>supremacy and maybe they have a </v>
<v Speaker 6>swastika.</v>

818
00:48:41.020 --> 00:48:43.390
<v Speaker 6>It's like that's a little sign saying if</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're a conservative,</v>

819
00:48:43.391 --> 00:48:44.224
<v Speaker 6>move away from those people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And most conservatives do that in the </v>

820
00:48:47.801 --> 00:48:49.750
<v Speaker 6>aftermath of Charlottesville.</v>
<v Speaker 6>For example,</v>

821
00:48:49.751 --> 00:48:53.230
<v Speaker 6>Shapiro immediately distanced himself </v>
<v Speaker 6>from the radical right.</v>

822
00:48:53.231 --> 00:48:54.064
<v Speaker 6>And William Buckley did the same thing </v>
<v Speaker 6>in the 1960 [inaudible] 1970s when he </v>

823
00:48:57.701 --> 00:48:59.860
<v Speaker 6>divorced himself from the John Birch </v>
<v Speaker 6>society.</v>

824
00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:02.830
<v Speaker 6>Conservatives are pretty good at putting</v>
<v Speaker 6>borders around things.</v>

825
00:49:03.010 --> 00:49:03.843
<v Speaker 6>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's a good definition of a </v>

826
00:49:04.661 --> 00:49:06.430
<v Speaker 6>conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm serious.</v>

827
00:49:06.431 --> 00:49:07.264
<v Speaker 6>I'm serious.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like conservatives like to have borders </v>

828
00:49:09.491 --> 00:49:11.350
<v Speaker 6>around things,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whereas liberals think,</v>

829
00:49:11.351 --> 00:49:14.200
<v Speaker 6>well if you have too many borders,</v>
<v Speaker 6>information can't flow.</v>

830
00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:15.153
<v Speaker 6>And that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the Conservatives say no borders </v>

831
00:49:17.651 --> 00:49:21.160
<v Speaker 6>chaos and the chaos and the liberals say</v>
<v Speaker 6>too many borders,</v>

832
00:49:21.310 --> 00:49:22.270
<v Speaker 6>stagnation.</v>

833
00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:25.450
<v Speaker 6>And those are both right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so you have to argue about how thick the</v>

834
00:49:25.451 --> 00:49:27.310
<v Speaker 6>borders should be.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But anyways,</v>

835
00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:28.413
<v Speaker 6>liberals have a hell of a time drawing </v>
<v Speaker 6>borders and that means they can't </v>

836
00:49:31.031 --> 00:49:35.920
<v Speaker 6>separate themselves from the radical </v>
<v Speaker 6>leftists who have absolutely no interest</v>

837
00:49:35.921 --> 00:49:38.800
<v Speaker 6>whatsoever in sustaining the genuine </v>
<v Speaker 6>liberals.</v>

838
00:49:38.801 --> 00:49:43.210
<v Speaker 6>They just use them as useful idiots to </v>
<v Speaker 6>take a phrase from the Soviet Union.</v>

839
00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:45.370
<v Speaker 6>And here are the hallmarks,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think,</v>

840
00:49:45.371 --> 00:49:46.204
<v Speaker 6>of the pathological left.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that if someone is pushing this </v>

841
00:49:50.411 --> 00:49:53.740
<v Speaker 6>quaternary on you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then you should,</v>

842
00:49:53.770 --> 00:49:57.970
<v Speaker 6>you should be very suspicious of them in</v>
<v Speaker 6>every possible way and you should resist</v>

843
00:49:57.971 --> 00:50:00.760
<v Speaker 6>it as much as you possibly can.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Diversity,</v>

844
00:50:00.761 --> 00:50:02.590
<v Speaker 6>inclusivity,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

845
00:50:02.620 --> 00:50:03.910
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>those are,</v>

846
00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:06.250
<v Speaker 6>those are the minor demons of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>radical left.</v>

847
00:50:06.251 --> 00:50:07.840
<v Speaker 6>Let's say equity.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

848
00:50:07.870 --> 00:50:10.390
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're not going there.</v>

849
00:50:10.420 --> 00:50:14.140
<v Speaker 6>That's equality of outcome,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not equality of opportunity and equality</v>

850
00:50:14.141 --> 00:50:14.974
<v Speaker 6>of outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll tell you why in a bit is an </v>

851
00:50:16.841 --> 00:50:18.730
<v Speaker 6>absolutely pathological idea.</v>

852
00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:21.910
<v Speaker 6>There's nothing about it that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's impossible to implement.</v>

853
00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:25.870
<v Speaker 6>It's fundamentally motivated by </v>
<v Speaker 6>resentment and it's a lie.</v>

854
00:50:26.530 --> 00:50:27.363
<v Speaker 6>So I liked fact that those three make </v>
<v Speaker 6>the acronym die though because that </v>

855
00:50:30.591 --> 00:50:33.590
<v Speaker 6>seems to be approximately appropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

856
00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:37.953
<v Speaker 6>and then the worst of the bunch is white</v>
<v Speaker 6>privilege because as far as I'm </v>

857
00:50:40.251 --> 00:50:42.890
<v Speaker 6>concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's absolutely no difference between</v>

858
00:50:42.891 --> 00:50:45.650
<v Speaker 6>that statement and an outright racist </v>
<v Speaker 6>slur.</v>

859
00:50:45.830 --> 00:50:48.410
<v Speaker 6>They're the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

860
00:50:49.010 --> 00:50:51.110
<v Speaker 6>and it's quite straight forward.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why it's not,</v>

861
00:50:51.111 --> 00:50:53.180
<v Speaker 6>it doesn't take a bloody genius to </v>
<v Speaker 6>figure this out.</v>

862
00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:58.420
<v Speaker 6>I mean what constitutes racism?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's the description of the hypothetical</v>

863
00:50:58.431 --> 00:51:01.820
<v Speaker 6>qualities of group to all the </v>
<v Speaker 6>individuals who compose that group.</v>

864
00:51:02.180 --> 00:51:03.013
<v Speaker 6>So white privileged.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like even the people who are </v>

865
00:51:05.841 --> 00:51:08.810
<v Speaker 6>interested in intersectionality you'd </v>
<v Speaker 6>think would have some problem with that.</v>

866
00:51:08.811 --> 00:51:09.644
<v Speaker 6>It's like what about all the poor white </v>
<v Speaker 6>people while they're more privileged </v>

867
00:51:12.261 --> 00:51:14.210
<v Speaker 6>than the poor people who aren't white I </v>
<v Speaker 6>suppose.</v>

868
00:51:14.210 --> 00:51:15.740
<v Speaker 6>But,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you know,</v>

869
00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:18.860
<v Speaker 6>that's a pretty bloody week argument in </v>
<v Speaker 6>my estimation.</v>

870
00:51:19.340 --> 00:51:21.200
<v Speaker 6>And to call it privilege is also </v>
<v Speaker 6>something.</v>

871
00:51:21.201 --> 00:51:22.034
<v Speaker 6>And to associate it with race per se is </v>
<v Speaker 6>also something extraordinarily </v>

872
00:51:24.621 --> 00:51:26.540
<v Speaker 6>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And we'll get into that a little bit.</v>

873
00:51:27.350 --> 00:51:30.230
<v Speaker 6>So let's talk about diversity.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>

874
00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:32.270
<v Speaker 6>well first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we have to define it.</v>

875
00:51:32.900 --> 00:51:33.733
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and Jonathan Hyde has been trying to </v>

876
00:51:34.551 --> 00:51:35.384
<v Speaker 6>define it as diversity of opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it might be useful to define it </v>

877
00:51:38.511 --> 00:51:39.344
<v Speaker 6>as diversity of personality because </v>
<v Speaker 6>there's actually more variability in </v>

878
00:51:42.141 --> 00:51:42.974
<v Speaker 6>personality within groups of people </v>
<v Speaker 6>regardless of the groups than there is </v>

879
00:51:46.191 --> 00:51:48.440
<v Speaker 6>between groups of people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So that should be said.</v>

880
00:51:48.441 --> 00:51:49.274
<v Speaker 6>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's more variability within groups </v>

881
00:51:51.321 --> 00:51:52.154
<v Speaker 6>of people then between groups of people </v>
<v Speaker 6>and to state otherwise is to state </v>

882
00:51:55.821 --> 00:51:58.730
<v Speaker 6>something that is in fact categorically </v>
<v Speaker 6>racist.</v>

883
00:51:58.910 --> 00:51:59.840
<v Speaker 6>Because if I said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

884
00:51:59.841 --> 00:52:03.350
<v Speaker 6>there's more difference between groups </v>
<v Speaker 6>of people than within groups,</v>

885
00:52:03.351 --> 00:52:07.250
<v Speaker 6>then I'm saying that each racial group </v>
<v Speaker 6>is an entity unto itself,</v>

886
00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:10.460
<v Speaker 6>which could be true but happens to </v>
<v Speaker 6>actually not be.</v>

887
00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:11.893
<v Speaker 6>So the diversity definition is really </v>
<v Speaker 6>quite interesting in right now that's </v>

888
00:52:15.501 --> 00:52:17.540
<v Speaker 6>being defined by race,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sex,</v>

889
00:52:17.541 --> 00:52:20.090
<v Speaker 6>or gender,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sexual orientation and disability.</v>

890
00:52:20.091 --> 00:52:24.650
<v Speaker 6>Although there's a very large number of </v>
<v Speaker 6>other potential dimensions of,</v>

891
00:52:24.980 --> 00:52:29.690
<v Speaker 6>of difference that could be included in </v>
<v Speaker 6>the list of oppressed versus oppressor.</v>

892
00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:32.660
<v Speaker 6>That's actually why intersectionality </v>
<v Speaker 6>has emerged,</v>

893
00:52:32.661 --> 00:52:34.700
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because people figured out,</v>

894
00:52:34.701 --> 00:52:35.870
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

895
00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:37.790
<v Speaker 6>you're having a harder time if you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>black,</v>

896
00:52:37.791 --> 00:52:38.624
<v Speaker 6>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and you're having a harder time if </v>

897
00:52:40.701 --> 00:52:44.390
<v Speaker 6>you're a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 6>depending on how you define harder time,</v>

898
00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:46.850
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you're even having a harder time.</v>

899
00:52:46.851 --> 00:52:49.130
<v Speaker 6>If you're a black woman,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's an intersection there.</v>

900
00:52:49.131 --> 00:52:49.761
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

901
00:52:49.761 --> 00:52:52.370
<v Speaker 6>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well where are we going to stop with the</v>

902
00:52:52.371 --> 00:52:54.530
<v Speaker 6>intersections?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I figured out the other day,</v>

903
00:52:54.531 --> 00:52:55.364
<v Speaker 6>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if each of those categories could be </v>

904
00:52:56.841 --> 00:53:00.110
<v Speaker 6>differentiated into a hundred sub units,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

905
00:53:00.111 --> 00:53:02.090
<v Speaker 6>who knows how many there are with </v>
<v Speaker 6>gender,</v>

906
00:53:02.091 --> 00:53:02.924
<v Speaker 6>sex,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's an infinite number of them </v>

907
00:53:03.681 --> 00:53:04.514
<v Speaker 6>apparently.</v>

908
00:53:04.940 --> 00:53:05.773
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then you need six dimensions before </v>

909
00:53:07.161 --> 00:53:07.994
<v Speaker 6>you're down to one in a billion.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So six dimensions of intersectionality </v>

910
00:53:10.851 --> 00:53:13.160
<v Speaker 6>brings you down to the level of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>individual,</v>

911
00:53:13.370 --> 00:53:16.400
<v Speaker 6>which is the flaw in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what would you call it?</v>

912
00:53:16.401 --> 00:53:17.740
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

913
00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:22.670
<v Speaker 6>identity politics theory manifesting </v>
<v Speaker 6>itself as an internal contradiction.</v>

914
00:53:22.790 --> 00:53:24.770
<v Speaker 6>So I think that's very funny.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you push,</v>

915
00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:28.350
<v Speaker 6>if you push intersectionality to its </v>
<v Speaker 6>final frontier,</v>

916
00:53:28.351 --> 00:53:30.930
<v Speaker 6>you break down every one to the level of</v>
<v Speaker 6>the individual,</v>

917
00:53:30.931 --> 00:53:31.764
<v Speaker 6>which is actually what I think western </v>
<v Speaker 6>culture figured out about 4,000 years </v>

918
00:53:34.501 --> 00:53:38.670
<v Speaker 6>ago is that the ultimate minority is the</v>
<v Speaker 6>individual and the only,</v>

919
00:53:38.671 --> 00:53:39.504
<v Speaker 6>and the fairest society is one where </v>
<v Speaker 6>individuals are allowed to rise to the </v>

920
00:53:42.811 --> 00:53:45.000
<v Speaker 6>level of their ability.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because how,</v>

921
00:53:45.030 --> 00:53:45.863
<v Speaker 6>what are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're going to co-vary out all their </v>

922
00:53:47.041 --> 00:53:48.960
<v Speaker 6>differences.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's impossible.</v>

923
00:53:48.961 --> 00:53:53.961
<v Speaker 6>It's technically impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's given postmodern logic itself.</v>

924
00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:57.720
<v Speaker 6>There's an infinite number of ways to </v>
<v Speaker 6>categorize a finite number of facts.</v>

925
00:53:57.870 --> 00:53:58.703
<v Speaker 6>So how are you going to determine which </v>
<v Speaker 6>dimensions of difference are the ones </v>

926
00:54:01.201 --> 00:54:03.660
<v Speaker 6>that should be adjusted for the </v>
<v Speaker 6>individual?</v>

927
00:54:03.780 --> 00:54:07.680
<v Speaker 6>Since there's an unlimited number of </v>
<v Speaker 6>dimensions of variability,</v>

928
00:54:07.770 --> 00:54:09.180
<v Speaker 6>intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 6>height,</v>

929
00:54:09.270 --> 00:54:10.830
<v Speaker 6>attractiveness,</v>
<v Speaker 6>age,</v>

930
00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:13.440
<v Speaker 6>personality,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's five dimensions of personality,</v>

931
00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:15.870
<v Speaker 6>socioeconomic class,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

932
00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:19.260
<v Speaker 6>Degree of historical oppression.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

933
00:54:19.390 --> 00:54:22.920
<v Speaker 6>I that can be seriously multiplied </v>
<v Speaker 6>endlessly.</v>

934
00:54:23.190 --> 00:54:25.380
<v Speaker 6>So what are you going to do control for </v>
<v Speaker 6>all those?</v>

935
00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:26.490
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>good luck.</v>

936
00:54:26.610 --> 00:54:27.443
<v Speaker 6>That's never going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then diversity in the service of </v>

937
00:54:29.821 --> 00:54:31.590
<v Speaker 6>what exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

938
00:54:31.591 --> 00:54:32.424
<v Speaker 6>the idea that a group of people that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>racially diverse is better at problem </v>

939
00:54:36.361 --> 00:54:37.194
<v Speaker 6>solving.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then a group of people who isn't there </v>

940
00:54:38.221 --> 00:54:40.770
<v Speaker 6>isn't a shred of evidence to support </v>
<v Speaker 6>that idea.</v>

941
00:54:41.070 --> 00:54:43.410
<v Speaker 6>It's a presupposition,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a supposition,</v>

942
00:54:43.620 --> 00:54:47.020
<v Speaker 6>and it also brings you back to something</v>
<v Speaker 6>like racial essential.</v>

943
00:54:47.021 --> 00:54:49.590
<v Speaker 6>Is it right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean so,</v>

944
00:54:50.010 --> 00:54:52.950
<v Speaker 6>so in every possible way logically and </v>
<v Speaker 6>practically,</v>

945
00:54:52.951 --> 00:54:53.784
<v Speaker 6>it's a nonstarter and I think the </v>
<v Speaker 6>diversity issue is irrelevant anyways </v>

946
00:54:57.781 --> 00:54:58.614
<v Speaker 6>because I think the fundamental reason </v>
<v Speaker 6>that the postmodern neil marks has </v>

947
00:55:01.951 --> 00:55:02.784
<v Speaker 6>pushed diversity is because it's another</v>
<v Speaker 6>way that they can attack the power </v>

948
00:55:05.371 --> 00:55:08.580
<v Speaker 6>structure that they regard as </v>
<v Speaker 6>patriarchal and oppressive say,</v>

949
00:55:08.581 --> 00:55:11.070
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's in the service of the working class</v>

950
00:55:11.071 --> 00:55:11.910
<v Speaker 6>and the oppressed.</v>

951
00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:12.743
<v Speaker 6>It's like we already covered that a </v>
<v Speaker 6>little bit with regards to the Marxists </v>

952
00:55:15.631 --> 00:55:16.464
<v Speaker 6>claims to be working on the side of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>working class when in fact what really </v>

953
00:55:19.531 --> 00:55:20.364
<v Speaker 6>happened was that many of them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>perhaps most were killed and the ones </v>

954
00:55:23.611 --> 00:55:26.820
<v Speaker 6>that weren't killed were certainly at </v>
<v Speaker 6>least made extraordinarily miserable,</v>

955
00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:29.040
<v Speaker 6>which may be is even better than killing</v>
<v Speaker 6>them.</v>

956
00:55:29.041 --> 00:55:30.600
<v Speaker 6>If you're particularly malevolent</v>

957
00:55:33.830 --> 00:55:34.663
<v Speaker 6>today and see one of the things that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>happening that's quite pathological is </v>

958
00:55:37.670 --> 00:55:41.450
<v Speaker 6>and very interesting is that the </v>
<v Speaker 6>postmodernists,</v>

959
00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:46.190
<v Speaker 6>and this is I think a direct consequence</v>
<v Speaker 6>of training of activists in universities</v>

960
00:55:46.191 --> 00:55:48.170
<v Speaker 6>and the universities have more to be </v>
<v Speaker 6>ashamed of,</v>

961
00:55:48.350 --> 00:55:50.390
<v Speaker 6>then you could list in a two hour </v>
<v Speaker 6>lecture.</v>

962
00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:51.703
<v Speaker 6>I think someone estimated today that </v>
<v Speaker 6>about 4,000 colleges and universities </v>

963
00:55:55.011 --> 00:55:57.290
<v Speaker 6>will go bankrupt in the u s and the next</v>
<v Speaker 6>10 years.</v>

964
00:55:57.291 --> 00:55:59.480
<v Speaker 6>And as far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the faster the better.</v>

965
00:55:59.930 --> 00:56:00.763
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so the Toronto District School Board </v>

966
00:56:04.430 --> 00:56:09.430
<v Speaker 6>announced recently that it will now give</v>
<v Speaker 6>priority to the hiring of diverse staff,</v>

967
00:56:10.070 --> 00:56:13.250
<v Speaker 6>especially in racialized backgrounds.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why in,</v>

968
00:56:13.251 --> 00:56:15.350
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I suspect it's because of the pope.</v>

969
00:56:15.410 --> 00:56:18.350
<v Speaker 6>People who wrote the damn policy are </v>
<v Speaker 6>functionally illiterate,</v>

970
00:56:18.830 --> 00:56:19.663
<v Speaker 6>but you'd certainly think that if you </v>
<v Speaker 6>looked at the intelligence of their </v>

971
00:56:22.011 --> 00:56:27.010
<v Speaker 6>policies and so what's that priority to </v>
<v Speaker 6>the hiring of diverse staff,</v>

972
00:56:27.011 --> 00:56:28.900
<v Speaker 6>especially in racialized backgrounds.</v>

973
00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:29.733
<v Speaker 6>What the hell did that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I tweeted that if you weren't going to </v>

974
00:56:31.631 --> 00:56:35.500
<v Speaker 6>hire straight white CIS is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

975
00:56:35.530 --> 00:56:36.363
<v Speaker 6>I guess this gendered is the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but we use it just because it's such a </v>

976
00:56:38.951 --> 00:56:39.784
<v Speaker 6>hateful phrase.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you're not going to hire a straight </v>

977
00:56:41.801 --> 00:56:42.634
<v Speaker 6>CIS gendered men as teachers,</v>
<v Speaker 6>why the hell do you let them into the </v>

978
00:56:45.401 --> 00:56:48.040
<v Speaker 6>faculties of education to begin with?</v>
<v Speaker 6>The amount as well,</v>

979
00:56:48.041 --> 00:56:51.040
<v Speaker 6>just exclude them before they waste four</v>
<v Speaker 6>years on your,</v>

980
00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:52.113
<v Speaker 6>what would you call them?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Ideologically rigid pseudo educational </v>

981
00:56:55.121 --> 00:56:58.090
<v Speaker 6>nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 6>equity.</v>

982
00:56:58.091 --> 00:57:01.330
<v Speaker 6>This is something I really like.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's the little happy thing,</v>

983
00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:04.720
<v Speaker 6>equality of opportunity on the left </v>
<v Speaker 6>versus equity on the right.</v>

984
00:57:04.721 --> 00:57:07.510
<v Speaker 6>You see the little kid gets to lift up </v>
<v Speaker 6>and eat the apple.</v>

985
00:57:07.511 --> 00:57:10.690
<v Speaker 6>Isn't that lovely?</v>
<v Speaker 6>But what happens really inequity is that</v>

986
00:57:10.691 --> 00:57:11.524
<v Speaker 6>everyone gets to have exactly the same </v>
<v Speaker 6>depth of grave and they're perfectly </v>

987
00:57:15.790 --> 00:57:17.890
<v Speaker 6>equal when they're six feet under.</v>

988
00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:20.050
<v Speaker 6>And if you not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you don't believe that,</v>

989
00:57:20.051 --> 00:57:23.410
<v Speaker 6>then you can look at what happened in </v>
<v Speaker 6>the Ukraine in the 1930s during the hall</v>

990
00:57:23.411 --> 00:57:24.244
<v Speaker 6>on the door when the Russians decided </v>
<v Speaker 6>that with the Soviets decided that it </v>

991
00:57:28.391 --> 00:57:29.224
<v Speaker 6>was perfectly reasonable to ascribe </v>
<v Speaker 6>class guilt to the successful farmers </v>

992
00:57:33.281 --> 00:57:37.120
<v Speaker 6>and wipe them out and then starve 6 </v>
<v Speaker 6>million Ukrainians to death,</v>

993
00:57:37.270 --> 00:57:42.270
<v Speaker 6>thus establishing a certain equality.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This woman,</v>

994
00:57:42.550 --> 00:57:43.383
<v Speaker 6>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I remind this is the shakespeare quote </v>

995
00:57:45.370 --> 00:57:47.560
<v Speaker 6>one,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it's from Richard the third,</v>

996
00:57:47.561 --> 00:57:48.394
<v Speaker 6>but I'm not exactly sure one can smile </v>
<v Speaker 6>and smile and smile and still be a </v>

997
00:57:52.091 --> 00:57:53.560
<v Speaker 6>villain.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you know,</v>

998
00:57:53.561 --> 00:57:56.680
<v Speaker 6>she's a lovely looking old grandmotherly</v>
<v Speaker 6>type of creature.</v>

999
00:57:56.681 --> 00:57:57.514
<v Speaker 6>But that doesn't mean that everything </v>
<v Speaker 6>that she did wasn't pathological beyond </v>

1000
00:58:01.061 --> 00:58:02.860
<v Speaker 6>belief and it was her,</v>
<v Speaker 6>her,</v>

1001
00:58:02.861 --> 00:58:04.340
<v Speaker 6>what would you call them?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

1002
00:58:04.690 --> 00:58:07.300
<v Speaker 6>a second rate,</v>
<v Speaker 6>pseudo intellectual,</v>

1003
00:58:07.540 --> 00:58:08.373
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>opinionated meanderings that produced </v>

1004
00:58:10.421 --> 00:58:11.370
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

1005
00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:13.390
<v Speaker 6>the concept of white privilege.</v>

1006
00:58:13.630 --> 00:58:14.463
<v Speaker 6>And what she did was make a list of all </v>
<v Speaker 6>the ways that she felt that she was </v>

1007
00:58:18.101 --> 00:58:21.640
<v Speaker 6>particularly privileged in society.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That was her bloody methodology.</v>

1008
00:58:21.850 --> 00:58:22.683
<v Speaker 6>And that's the sort of methodology that </v>
<v Speaker 6>these pseudo disciplines that have </v>

1009
00:58:25.031 --> 00:58:25.864
<v Speaker 6>invaded the universities get away with </v>
<v Speaker 6>because the rest of the faculty are too </v>

1010
00:58:28.811 --> 00:58:32.860
<v Speaker 6>damn timid to stand up and say the </v>
<v Speaker 6>emperor has no clothes.</v>

1011
00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:33.993
<v Speaker 6>Better stand up and say something about </v>
<v Speaker 6>it pretty soon because you can bloody </v>

1012
00:58:36.671 --> 00:58:37.504
<v Speaker 6>well be sure that they're coming for the</v>
<v Speaker 6>physicians and the evolutionaries </v>

1013
00:58:39.970 --> 00:58:40.803
<v Speaker 6>biologists and psychologists next.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And they're not weak and they're well </v>

1014
00:58:43.991 --> 00:58:46.990
<v Speaker 6>organized.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so it's a very terrible thing.</v>

1015
00:58:46.991 --> 00:58:47.824
<v Speaker 6>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the papers rely on personal examples </v>

1016
00:58:50.770 --> 00:58:51.603
<v Speaker 6>because we know how it methodologically </v>
<v Speaker 6>rigorous that is of unearned advantage </v>

1017
00:58:55.091 --> 00:58:57.550
<v Speaker 6>as Mac.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But that whole methodology thing,</v>

1018
00:58:57.551 --> 00:59:01.150
<v Speaker 6>that rigorous methodology,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's just another manifestation of the</v>

1019
00:59:01.151 --> 00:59:01.984
<v Speaker 6>euro centric patriarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you don't have to be concerned about </v>

1020
00:59:04.241 --> 00:59:07.810
<v Speaker 6>your damn methodology when you have your</v>
<v Speaker 6>personal experience to rely on.</v>

1021
00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:10.540
<v Speaker 6>And so here's the privileges.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can't.</v>

1022
00:59:10.541 --> 00:59:11.374
<v Speaker 6>If I wished to arrange,</v>
<v Speaker 6>arrange to be in the company of people </v>

1023
00:59:13.481 --> 00:59:14.950
<v Speaker 6>of my race,</v>
<v Speaker 6>most of the time,</v>

1024
00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:16.233
<v Speaker 6>if I should need to move,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can be pretty sure of renting or </v>

1025
00:59:17.831 --> 00:59:18.664
<v Speaker 6>purchasing housing in an area which I </v>
<v Speaker 6>can afford in which I would want to </v>

1026
00:59:21.201 --> 00:59:22.034
<v Speaker 6>live.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can be pretty sure that my neighbors </v>

1027
00:59:23.241 --> 00:59:27.080
<v Speaker 6>in such a location will be neutral or </v>
<v Speaker 6>pleasant to me unless they know that I'm</v>

1028
00:59:27.081 --> 00:59:29.570
<v Speaker 6>the author of the fundamental paper on </v>
<v Speaker 6>white privilege.</v>

1029
00:59:32.090 --> 00:59:34.100
<v Speaker 6>I can go shopping alone most of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>time,</v>

1030
00:59:34.101 --> 00:59:36.710
<v Speaker 6>pretty well assured that I will not be </v>
<v Speaker 6>followed or harassed.</v>

1031
00:59:36.890 --> 00:59:37.311
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

1032
00:59:37.311 --> 00:59:40.700
<v Speaker 6>the first thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is lot of those so called privileges are</v>

1033
00:59:40.701 --> 00:59:41.534
<v Speaker 6>just the consequence of living in a </v>
<v Speaker 6>reasonably civilized society and apply </v>

1034
00:59:44.091 --> 00:59:44.924
<v Speaker 6>to pretty much everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the second thing is is that there's </v>

1035
00:59:47.211 --> 00:59:48.044
<v Speaker 6>no reason to associate this with race.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's another one of these absolutely </v>

1036
00:59:51.621 --> 00:59:55.610
<v Speaker 6>pathological sleights of hand.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How about we call it majority privilege.</v>

1037
00:59:55.790 --> 00:59:59.990
<v Speaker 6>You think that's not the case for the </v>
<v Speaker 6>majority members of every society that's</v>

1038
00:59:59.991 --> 01:00:02.060
<v Speaker 6>ever function that's actually been </v>
<v Speaker 6>functional?</v>

1039
01:00:02.061 --> 01:00:02.894
<v Speaker 6>Obviously there's a majority advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If there wasn't a bloody majority </v>

1040
01:00:05.301 --> 01:00:08.150
<v Speaker 6>advantage,</v>
<v Speaker 6>people wouldn't make societies the whole</v>

1041
01:00:08.151 --> 01:00:08.984
<v Speaker 6>point of making a society so that the </v>
<v Speaker 6>people within the society have the </v>

1042
01:00:13.101 --> 01:00:15.410
<v Speaker 6>advantages.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So now you might say,</v>

1043
01:00:15.411 --> 01:00:16.244
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when people are being integrated into </v>

1044
01:00:17.421 --> 01:00:18.920
<v Speaker 6>this society,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they should be given.</v>

1045
01:00:18.921 --> 01:00:22.550
<v Speaker 6>Those advantages are provided with those</v>
<v Speaker 6>advantages when they join the club,</v>

1046
01:00:22.551 --> 01:00:24.500
<v Speaker 6>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 6>as rapidly as possible.</v>

1047
01:00:24.650 --> 01:00:25.483
<v Speaker 6>And obviously that's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But to attribute this level of civility </v>

1048
01:00:28.911 --> 01:00:32.900
<v Speaker 6>and safety to some hypothetical </v>
<v Speaker 6>construct like white privileges,</v>

1049
01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:35.870
<v Speaker 6>well it's exactly what you'd expect from</v>
<v Speaker 6>people who,</v>

1050
01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:37.063
<v Speaker 6>who,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whose response to the idea of </v>

1051
01:00:38.571 --> 01:00:39.404
<v Speaker 6>methodology is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that's just a social construct like </v>

1052
01:00:41.781 --> 01:00:42.950
<v Speaker 6>everything else is,</v>

1053
01:00:45.630 --> 01:00:48.810
<v Speaker 6>there's the class enemies from the </v>
<v Speaker 6>Ukraine,</v>

1054
01:00:48.811 --> 01:00:49.710
<v Speaker 6>the Kulaks,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

1055
01:00:49.711 --> 01:00:50.544
<v Speaker 6>They were the farmers who were </v>
<v Speaker 6>productive in the 1920s and before had </v>

1056
01:00:53.491 --> 01:00:56.130
<v Speaker 6>mirror recently emerged from the peasant</v>
<v Speaker 6>class.</v>

1057
01:00:56.230 --> 01:00:57.063
<v Speaker 6>They were all rounded up and shot and </v>
<v Speaker 6>raped and robbed and then sent to </v>

1058
01:01:00.091 --> 01:01:05.091
<v Speaker 6>Siberia to freeze to death or to die of </v>
<v Speaker 6>some infectious disease because to them,</v>

1059
01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:10.380
<v Speaker 6>guilt was attributed as a consequence of</v>
<v Speaker 6>their membership of a class.</v>

1060
01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:13.770
<v Speaker 6>And I can tell you if there are people </v>
<v Speaker 6>around you that are attributing guilt to</v>

1061
01:01:13.771 --> 01:01:15.780
<v Speaker 6>you because of your membership in a </v>
<v Speaker 6>class,</v>

1062
01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:17.610
<v Speaker 6>they are not your friends.</v>
<v Speaker 6>In fact,</v>

1063
01:01:17.611 --> 01:01:18.444
<v Speaker 6>they're the friends of no one and </v>
<v Speaker 6>they're contributing to this intense </v>

1064
01:01:20.761 --> 01:01:24.180
<v Speaker 6>state of political polarization and </v>
<v Speaker 6>racial disharmony.</v>

1065
01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:27.810
<v Speaker 6>That seems to be me to be expanding at </v>
<v Speaker 6>an exponential rate.</v>

1066
01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:28.793
<v Speaker 6>It's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I really liked this juxtaposition of </v>

1067
01:01:31.291 --> 01:01:32.124
<v Speaker 6>pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So when the Soviets collectivize the </v>

1068
01:01:34.141 --> 01:01:36.660
<v Speaker 6>farms in the Ukraine,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they take,</v>

1069
01:01:36.661 --> 01:01:40.740
<v Speaker 6>took all the grain that the Ukrainians </v>
<v Speaker 6>had had had produced,</v>

1070
01:01:40.741 --> 01:01:41.574
<v Speaker 6>which wasn't very much because they'd </v>
<v Speaker 6>collectivize the farms and they shipped </v>

1071
01:01:44.071 --> 01:01:45.060
<v Speaker 6>it all to the cities.</v>

1072
01:01:45.270 --> 01:01:46.103
<v Speaker 6>And then the rule was that if you are a </v>
<v Speaker 6>starving Ukrainian woman who had </v>

1073
01:01:48.541 --> 01:01:52.680
<v Speaker 6>children and you went out in the field </v>
<v Speaker 6>and you picked up individual half rotten</v>

1074
01:01:52.681 --> 01:01:55.560
<v Speaker 6>bits of grain to feed your kids,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that that was,</v>

1075
01:01:56.130 --> 01:01:58.740
<v Speaker 6>that was a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no offense punishable by death.</v>

1076
01:01:58.890 --> 01:01:59.723
<v Speaker 6>You were supposed to turn that in to the</v>
<v Speaker 6>local authority so they could ship that </v>

1077
01:02:02.161 --> 01:02:05.640
<v Speaker 6>to the city too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So on the one hand you have nice picture</v>

1078
01:02:05.641 --> 01:02:06.474
<v Speaker 6>here of the bags of grain that we're </v>
<v Speaker 6>heroically going into the cities and in </v>

1079
01:02:08.941 --> 01:02:09.774
<v Speaker 6>the other hand you have a picture of the</v>
<v Speaker 6>bodies that were the cost of doing </v>

1080
01:02:12.661 --> 01:02:13.710
<v Speaker 6>precisely that.</v>

1081
01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:17.710
<v Speaker 6>So let's look at the failures of this </v>
<v Speaker 6>system.</v>

1082
01:02:18.130 --> 01:02:20.640
<v Speaker 6>Well you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you could list them forever.</v>

1083
01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:23.100
<v Speaker 6>The death of the cool acts that was </v>
<v Speaker 6>right off the bat,</v>

1084
01:02:23.101 --> 01:02:24.660
<v Speaker 6>which is why I use it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was very,</v>

1085
01:02:24.661 --> 01:02:27.540
<v Speaker 6>very early in the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in the collectivization process.</v>

1086
01:02:27.541 --> 01:02:30.460
<v Speaker 6>Then the Ukrainian famine,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which I mean,</v>

1087
01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:31.313
<v Speaker 6>I don't know how often that's taught in </v>
<v Speaker 6>high schools in the United States and </v>

1088
01:02:33.601 --> 01:02:34.434
<v Speaker 6>Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I would suspect never is the answer </v>

1089
01:02:36.271 --> 01:02:37.104
<v Speaker 6>to that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the rise of the Gulag state because it </v>

1090
01:02:39.061 --> 01:02:39.894
<v Speaker 6>turned out that the bloody Soviet Union </v>
<v Speaker 6>couldn't function unless they enslaved </v>

1091
01:02:42.661 --> 01:02:46.230
<v Speaker 6>everybody and made them work the death </v>
<v Speaker 6>of tens of millions.</v>

1092
01:02:46.231 --> 01:02:49.200
<v Speaker 6>It's uncountable.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The 56 crackdown on Hungary,</v>

1093
01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:52.510
<v Speaker 6>the 68 invasion of Czechoslovakia,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not dimension,</v>

1094
01:02:52.650 --> 01:02:53.483
<v Speaker 6>the whole Cold War that put the whole </v>
<v Speaker 6>goddamn world at risk from 1962 to 1989 </v>

1095
01:02:57.991 --> 01:03:02.430
<v Speaker 6>and that still rear is rearing its ugly </v>
<v Speaker 6>head with our current dispute with North</v>

1096
01:03:02.430 --> 01:03:05.760
<v Speaker 6>Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is the last remaining,</v>

1097
01:03:05.790 --> 01:03:10.790
<v Speaker 6>let's call it ghoulag like Soviet state,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so there's the death counts.</v>

1098
01:03:11.310 --> 01:03:14.580
<v Speaker 6>Perhaps that's a relatively conservative</v>
<v Speaker 6>estimate,</v>

1099
01:03:15.150 --> 01:03:19.590
<v Speaker 6>eight to 61 million in the Soviet Union.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was quite a margin of error,</v>

1100
01:03:19.591 --> 01:03:21.900
<v Speaker 6>wouldn't you say?</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the red terror,</v>

1101
01:03:21.901 --> 01:03:22.734
<v Speaker 6>the great purge,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the national operations of the end kvd </v>

1102
01:03:26.490 --> 01:03:28.140
<v Speaker 6>later the KGB,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the great purge in Mongolia,</v>

1103
01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:32.340
<v Speaker 6>Soviet killings during World War II,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the People's Republic of China,</v>

1104
01:03:32.430 --> 01:03:34.560
<v Speaker 6>land reform,</v>
<v Speaker 6>land reform.</v>

1105
01:03:34.770 --> 01:03:36.030
<v Speaker 6>That's how,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's how you,</v>

1106
01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:37.013
<v Speaker 6>that's what you call it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When you take land that grows food and </v>

1107
01:03:38.971 --> 01:03:41.430
<v Speaker 6>turn it into land that's just full of </v>
<v Speaker 6>corpses.</v>

1108
01:03:41.580 --> 01:03:42.413
<v Speaker 6>That's land reform and the suppression </v>
<v Speaker 6>of counter-revolutionaries the great </v>

1109
01:03:46.111 --> 01:03:48.270
<v Speaker 6>leap forward.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That was a good one.</v>

1110
01:03:48.450 --> 01:03:50.880
<v Speaker 6>The great proletarian cultural </v>
<v Speaker 6>revolution,</v>

1111
01:03:50.881 --> 01:03:51.714
<v Speaker 6>Cambodian,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the killing fields and then a list of </v>

1112
01:03:53.461 --> 01:03:54.294
<v Speaker 6>other countries.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Every single place where these </v>

1113
01:03:55.950 --> 01:03:56.783
<v Speaker 6>pathological ideas were put into </v>
<v Speaker 6>practice became what you might describe </v>

1114
01:04:00.751 --> 01:04:01.584
<v Speaker 6>as the literal equivalent of hell on </v>
<v Speaker 6>earth so rapidly that it was a kind of </v>

1115
01:04:05.101 --> 01:04:07.650
<v Speaker 6>miracle in and of itself.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And yet we still,</v>

1116
01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:08.550
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what is it,</v>

1117
01:04:08.550 --> 01:04:09.383
<v Speaker 6>one out of five social scientists in </v>
<v Speaker 6>American universities regard themselves </v>

1118
01:04:12.661 --> 01:04:13.620
<v Speaker 6>as Marxists.</v>

1119
01:04:13.770 --> 01:04:15.240
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what the hell?</v>

1120
01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:17.070
<v Speaker 6>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 6>really?</v>

1121
01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:20.790
<v Speaker 6>What is going on with that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't understand that in the least.</v>

1122
01:04:21.180 --> 01:04:25.980
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't understand why that pathological</v>

1123
01:04:25.981 --> 01:04:26.814
<v Speaker 6>ideology that's so murderous,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so intensely murderers and so closely </v>

1124
01:04:30.121 --> 01:04:34.760
<v Speaker 6>tied to the genocides from a causal </v>
<v Speaker 6>perspective can,</v>

1125
01:04:35.050 --> 01:04:40.050
<v Speaker 6>cannot have accreted to at the same,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what would you call an honorable,</v>

1126
01:04:40.690 --> 01:04:41.523
<v Speaker 6>uhh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>honorable state that Nazi-ism has </v>

1127
01:04:44.250 --> 01:04:46.350
<v Speaker 6>accrued to itself.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What's going on?</v>

1128
01:04:46.351 --> 01:04:48.270
<v Speaker 6>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why don't we see it that way?</v>

1129
01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:50.520
<v Speaker 6>I don't understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1130
01:04:50.521 --> 01:04:51.354
<v Speaker 6>maybe it's because of the hypothetical </v>
<v Speaker 6>universal utopia that the damn Soviets </v>

1131
01:04:54.691 --> 01:04:55.524
<v Speaker 6>were aiming at.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe you could get away with that in </v>

1132
01:04:56.911 --> 01:05:01.380
<v Speaker 6>1895 you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>or maybe after world war one when things</v>

1133
01:05:01.381 --> 01:05:02.214
<v Speaker 6>were brutal and the monarchies of Europe</v>
<v Speaker 6>were collapsing and everything was </v>

1134
01:05:05.221 --> 01:05:08.250
<v Speaker 6>chaotic,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you didn't know that your Utopian ideas,</v>

1135
01:05:08.251 --> 01:05:10.830
<v Speaker 6>we're going to result in an absolute </v>
<v Speaker 6>catastrophe,</v>

1136
01:05:10.831 --> 01:05:11.664
<v Speaker 6>but it's a hundred years after that now </v>
<v Speaker 6>almost to the day and when the evidence </v>

1137
01:05:14.971 --> 01:05:17.410
<v Speaker 6>is clearly in I'm a Marxist,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's no,</v>

1138
01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:18.393
<v Speaker 6>you're just jealous because you don't </v>
<v Speaker 6>make as much as a bloody investment </v>

1139
01:05:21.131 --> 01:05:23.800
<v Speaker 6>banker.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So that's why you're a bloody</v>

1140
01:05:26.170 --> 01:05:29.170
<v Speaker 6>Marxist.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fewer paid four times as much.</v>

1141
01:05:29.171 --> 01:05:31.990
<v Speaker 6>You'd be a capitalist so fast it would </v>
<v Speaker 6>make your head spin.</v>

1142
01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:38.333
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to talk for 15 more minutes </v>
<v Speaker 6>because we started a little late and I </v>

1143
01:05:40.891 --> 01:05:43.050
<v Speaker 6>do want to get through this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So what's the problem?</v>

1144
01:05:43.051 --> 01:05:43.884
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we already discussed it and I want to </v>

1145
01:05:44.821 --> 01:05:47.040
<v Speaker 6>show you a different way of </v>
<v Speaker 6>conceptualizing it.</v>

1146
01:05:48.180 --> 01:05:51.660
<v Speaker 6>This is based on some of the work that </v>
<v Speaker 6>I've done on archetypes and I think of,</v>

1147
01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:54.180
<v Speaker 6>I think of archetypes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>has images,</v>

1148
01:05:54.181 --> 01:05:57.030
<v Speaker 6>stick representations of the axioms of </v>
<v Speaker 6>thought.</v>

1149
01:05:57.240 --> 01:06:00.960
<v Speaker 6>That's a reasonable way of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>or maybe of the axioms of being itself.</v>

1150
01:06:00.961 --> 01:06:04.200
<v Speaker 6>There are categories of being pain is a </v>
<v Speaker 6>category of being,</v>

1151
01:06:04.201 --> 01:06:06.570
<v Speaker 6>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a suffering limitation.</v>

1152
01:06:06.571 --> 01:06:07.404
<v Speaker 6>Finitude.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Those are all categories of being and </v>

1153
01:06:09.181 --> 01:06:10.014
<v Speaker 6>they're very realistic.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're the fundamental elements of </v>

1154
01:06:12.361 --> 01:06:14.100
<v Speaker 6>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Essentially.</v>

1155
01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:17.700
<v Speaker 6>It's a different different in some sense</v>
<v Speaker 6>than a materialist view point,</v>

1156
01:06:17.701 --> 01:06:18.534
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because the materialists make the claim </v>

1157
01:06:20.250 --> 01:06:21.083
<v Speaker 6>and perfectly reasonable in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 6>that the fundamental realities are </v>

1158
01:06:24.001 --> 01:06:24.834
<v Speaker 6>material,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they're only the fundamental </v>

1159
01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:30.390
<v Speaker 6>realities in some sense if you define </v>
<v Speaker 6>them that way,</v>

1160
01:06:30.391 --> 01:06:31.224
<v Speaker 6>not that that isn't useful and not that </v>
<v Speaker 6>you can't derive objective truth that's </v>

1161
01:06:34.951 --> 01:06:35.784
<v Speaker 6>pragmatically useful from that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the fundamental realities of life </v>

1162
01:06:39.391 --> 01:06:41.790
<v Speaker 6>have a lot more to do with motivation </v>
<v Speaker 6>and emotion,</v>

1163
01:06:41.791 --> 01:06:43.560
<v Speaker 6>especially with regards to suffering.</v>

1164
01:06:43.980 --> 01:06:46.920
<v Speaker 6>And so that is the unsolved problem of </v>
<v Speaker 6>human existence.</v>

1165
01:06:46.921 --> 01:06:47.754
<v Speaker 6>And we talked about the different ways </v>
<v Speaker 6>of conceptualizing that and I want to </v>

1166
01:06:50.910 --> 01:06:54.900
<v Speaker 6>walk you quickly through some of my </v>
<v Speaker 6>thinking about the root,</v>

1167
01:06:54.901 --> 01:06:59.220
<v Speaker 6>the true roots of of suffering and human</v>
<v Speaker 6>vulnerability.</v>

1168
01:06:59.221 --> 01:07:03.120
<v Speaker 6>And I think of this as an antidote to </v>
<v Speaker 6>ideological possession.</v>

1169
01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:07.110
<v Speaker 6>I think that this is the fundamental map</v>
<v Speaker 6>of religious belief.</v>

1170
01:07:07.111 --> 01:07:08.640
<v Speaker 6>And I'll walk you through it very </v>
<v Speaker 6>quickly.</v>

1171
01:07:08.641 --> 01:07:09.474
<v Speaker 6>And that what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what happens in the case of an ideology </v>

1172
01:07:13.111 --> 01:07:13.944
<v Speaker 6>is an ideology takes a fragment of a </v>
<v Speaker 6>religious belief system and expands it </v>

1173
01:07:18.091 --> 01:07:18.924
<v Speaker 6>up into a totality and has its motive </v>
<v Speaker 6>power because it draws on these </v>

1174
01:07:22.441 --> 01:07:27.030
<v Speaker 6>underlying religious slash archetipal </v>
<v Speaker 6>narratives for its power.</v>

1175
01:07:27.150 --> 01:07:28.510
<v Speaker 6>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know the,</v>

1176
01:07:28.770 --> 01:07:31.290
<v Speaker 6>the idea of the future socialist utopia </v>
<v Speaker 6>is very,</v>

1177
01:07:31.291 --> 01:07:34.110
<v Speaker 6>very similar to the idea of the Kingdom </v>
<v Speaker 6>of heaven on earth.</v>

1178
01:07:34.111 --> 01:07:35.070
<v Speaker 6>It was always,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1179
01:07:35.071 --> 01:07:37.620
<v Speaker 6>that's a cardinal element of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>of,</v>

1180
01:07:37.860 --> 01:07:38.693
<v Speaker 6>of the three western major religions.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So here's a way of conceptualizing </v>

1181
01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:44.633
<v Speaker 6>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And each of these levels of </v>

1182
01:07:46.231 --> 01:07:49.470
<v Speaker 6>conceptualization have their own </v>
<v Speaker 6>symbolic representations.</v>

1183
01:07:49.471 --> 01:07:50.304
<v Speaker 6>And you can see these what portrayed </v>
<v Speaker 6>consistently throughout the narratives </v>

1184
01:07:55.731 --> 01:07:56.564
<v Speaker 6>that we use to guide our existence.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Even the ones that we don't understand </v>

1185
01:07:59.211 --> 01:08:00.590
<v Speaker 6>explicitly,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they come up in,</v>

1186
01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:01.753
<v Speaker 6>in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in movies and in and in books and in </v>

1187
01:08:03.951 --> 01:08:04.784
<v Speaker 6>myths and the stories we tell each other</v>
<v Speaker 6>and in our dreams and our imagination </v>

1188
01:08:07.940 --> 01:08:08.773
<v Speaker 6>constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So they're really the categories of the </v>

1189
01:08:10.161 --> 01:08:10.994
<v Speaker 6>imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so the first category and the one </v>

1190
01:08:13.791 --> 01:08:16.220
<v Speaker 6>that's most difficult to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I called the dragon</v>

1191
01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:19.670
<v Speaker 7>of chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's sort of the outer most circle.</v>

1192
01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:24.590
<v Speaker 7>That's a good illustration of it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're the dragon is a very large,</v>

1193
01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:25.453
<v Speaker 7>a very common symbol worldwide.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And an anthropologist slash biologist </v>

1194
01:08:29.330 --> 01:08:32.720
<v Speaker 7>who I recently read called it a sneak </v>
<v Speaker 7>cat bird,</v>

1195
01:08:32.990 --> 01:08:34.670
<v Speaker 7>which I really liked.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

1196
01:08:34.820 --> 01:08:37.100
<v Speaker 7>and he thought about it as an amalgam of</v>
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

1197
01:08:37.130 --> 01:08:39.410
<v Speaker 7>of the idea of Predator,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1198
01:08:39.411 --> 01:08:40.244
<v Speaker 7>because our tree dwelling ancestors and </v>
<v Speaker 7>after that we're basically prayed on </v>

1199
01:08:43.610 --> 01:08:44.443
<v Speaker 7>burt by birds of prey by predatory cats </v>
<v Speaker 7>and by snakes and so well and God only </v>

1200
01:08:48.921 --> 01:08:51.950
<v Speaker 7>knows how much,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how many times fire did the men as well.</v>

1201
01:08:51.951 --> 01:08:55.010
<v Speaker 7>So a fire breathing tree,</v>
<v Speaker 7>cat tree,</v>

1202
01:08:55.011 --> 01:08:55.844
<v Speaker 7>snake bird is a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>is a very good representation of the </v>

1203
01:08:58.641 --> 01:09:02.240
<v Speaker 7>category of everything that's out there </v>
<v Speaker 7>in the unknown that can do you in.</v>

1204
01:09:02.630 --> 01:09:03.463
<v Speaker 7>And that become elaborated over the </v>
<v Speaker 7>course of time into the idea of the </v>

1205
01:09:05.931 --> 01:09:09.380
<v Speaker 7>dragon that hoards gold or that hoards </v>
<v Speaker 7>virgins for that matter.</v>

1206
01:09:09.620 --> 01:09:12.920
<v Speaker 7>The idea being that human beings are </v>
<v Speaker 7>half pray and half Predator.</v>

1207
01:09:12.921 --> 01:09:13.754
<v Speaker 7>And so that we have to make a </v>
<v Speaker 7>representation of that which exists </v>

1208
01:09:17.241 --> 01:09:19.790
<v Speaker 7>beyond our comprehension that can do </v>
<v Speaker 7>[inaudible].</v>

1209
01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:22.340
<v Speaker 7>And so that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the dragon of chaos,</v>

1210
01:09:22.341 --> 01:09:23.174
<v Speaker 7>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But also come to understand that </v>

1211
01:09:25.161 --> 01:09:25.994
<v Speaker 7>confronting that voluntarily is the </v>
<v Speaker 7>appropriate way to gather new </v>

1212
01:09:28.821 --> 01:09:29.654
<v Speaker 7>information and to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And that's really the fundamental human </v>

1213
01:09:32.391 --> 01:09:33.224
<v Speaker 7>story,</v>
<v Speaker 7>fundamental human stories to go boldly </v>

1214
01:09:36.261 --> 01:09:37.094
<v Speaker 7>where no one has gone before and what </v>
<v Speaker 7>you encounter are the terrible dragons </v>

1215
01:09:41.481 --> 01:09:44.180
<v Speaker 7>that exist beyond your field of </v>
<v Speaker 7>comprehension.</v>

1216
01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:45.223
<v Speaker 7>And if you can manage that forthrightly,</v>
<v Speaker 7>then you gathered the kind of </v>

1217
01:09:47.781 --> 01:09:50.930
<v Speaker 7>information and riches that enables you </v>
<v Speaker 7>to develop yourself,</v>

1218
01:09:51.110 --> 01:09:53.540
<v Speaker 7>character logically,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and to benefit your community.</v>

1219
01:09:53.750 --> 01:09:57.650
<v Speaker 7>That's the fundamental story of mankind,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the fundamental positive story.</v>

1220
01:09:57.860 --> 01:10:00.350
<v Speaker 7>And that's the underpinning of the hero </v>
<v Speaker 7>mythology.</v>

1221
01:10:00.740 --> 01:10:01.573
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is a lovely antidote to </v>

1222
01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:05.150
<v Speaker 7>ideological presupposition.</v>

1223
01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:07.840
<v Speaker 7>So that's the outer most,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

1224
01:10:08.210 --> 01:10:09.043
<v Speaker 7>the outer most reality you would say.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's the unknown unknowns that Donald </v>

1225
01:10:12.830 --> 01:10:13.460
<v Speaker 7>Rumsfeld,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1226
01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:14.293
<v Speaker 7>referred to and nested inside that are </v>
<v Speaker 7>the terrible things about life that you </v>

1227
01:10:18.561 --> 01:10:20.350
<v Speaker 7>actually encounter,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that you,</v>

1228
01:10:20.660 --> 01:10:23.600
<v Speaker 7>they're not the hypothetical things that</v>
<v Speaker 7>might get you there.</v>

1229
01:10:23.601 --> 01:10:26.570
<v Speaker 7>The actual things that you encounter </v>
<v Speaker 7>that you don't know.</v>

1230
01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:29.180
<v Speaker 7>And some of those are positive and some </v>
<v Speaker 7>of those are negative,</v>

1231
01:10:29.181 --> 01:10:29.690
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and,</v>

1232
01:10:29.690 --> 01:10:34.130
<v Speaker 7>and that can even flip because sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 7>your life is turned upside down by let's</v>

1233
01:10:34.131 --> 01:10:38.480
<v Speaker 7>say by a rejection from someone you love</v>
<v Speaker 7>should be a good example of the terrible</v>

1234
01:10:38.481 --> 01:10:40.670
<v Speaker 7>mother that's the great mother on the </v>
<v Speaker 7>outer ring.</v>

1235
01:10:41.290 --> 01:10:42.123
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but that can mature you and make you </v>

1236
01:10:43.731 --> 01:10:46.030
<v Speaker 7>wake up as well.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so the,</v>

1237
01:10:46.260 --> 01:10:48.470
<v Speaker 7>the encounter with,</v>
<v Speaker 7>with these,</v>

1238
01:10:48.590 --> 01:10:51.680
<v Speaker 7>with the things that transcend your,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what would you call it,</v>

1239
01:10:51.681 --> 01:10:54.830
<v Speaker 7>your competence or also things that can </v>
<v Speaker 7>make you grow and mature.</v>

1240
01:10:55.430 --> 01:10:56.263
<v Speaker 7>So you could think of the great mother </v>
<v Speaker 7>as nature and the great father as </v>

1241
01:10:59.751 --> 01:11:03.500
<v Speaker 7>culture and the individual as the person</v>
<v Speaker 7>who is enveloped by culture.</v>

1242
01:11:03.501 --> 01:11:04.334
<v Speaker 7>And by nature,</v>
<v Speaker 7>when you move to the fringes of your </v>

1243
01:11:06.291 --> 01:11:08.840
<v Speaker 7>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you encounter nature itself.</v>

1244
01:11:08.841 --> 01:11:11.060
<v Speaker 7>And that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 7>let's say geographically,</v>

1245
01:11:11.061 --> 01:11:13.070
<v Speaker 7>but it's also the case conceptually,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1246
01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:14.580
<v Speaker 7>Because if you're the master</v>

1247
01:11:14.580 --> 01:11:17.730
<v Speaker 6>of a field of endeavor,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is a geographical metaphor,</v>

1248
01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:21.720
<v Speaker 6>you move towards the fringes so that you</v>
<v Speaker 6>can stand on the unknown,</v>

1249
01:11:22.020 --> 01:11:22.853
<v Speaker 6>encounter something that's new,</v>
<v Speaker 6>transform what's new and inhabitable </v>

1250
01:11:25.921 --> 01:11:29.010
<v Speaker 6>territory and extend the dimension of </v>
<v Speaker 6>human capacity.</v>

1251
01:11:29.310 --> 01:11:33.090
<v Speaker 6>And so it works on a practical </v>
<v Speaker 6>geographical level of representation,</v>

1252
01:11:33.091 --> 01:11:35.370
<v Speaker 6>but also on a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>on a,</v>

1253
01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:36.353
<v Speaker 6>on an abstract level.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so you can also think about it as a </v>

1254
01:11:39.451 --> 01:11:40.284
<v Speaker 6>person on an island in an ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a good way of thinking about the </v>

1255
01:11:42.841 --> 01:11:43.674
<v Speaker 6>human condition.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Except the person has two elements and </v>

1256
01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:47.273
<v Speaker 6>the island has two elements.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so does the ocean and the persons </v>

1257
01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:50.693
<v Speaker 6>two elements are classically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the good and evil that wars in their </v>

1258
01:11:54.781 --> 01:11:57.630
<v Speaker 6>heart.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because it isn't so self evident exactly</v>

1259
01:11:57.631 --> 01:11:58.464
<v Speaker 6>where your enemy is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it might be the class structure </v>

1260
01:12:00.121 --> 01:12:00.954
<v Speaker 6>that's oppressing you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it might be the snake in your own </v>

1261
01:12:02.911 --> 01:12:03.720
<v Speaker 6>heart.</v>

1262
01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:04.553
<v Speaker 6>And it's certainly the case that if you </v>
<v Speaker 6>read people like Viktor Frankl and </v>

1263
01:12:06.841 --> 01:12:07.674
<v Speaker 6>Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn just to take it </v>
<v Speaker 6>start who were very perspicacious </v>

1264
01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:17.300
<v Speaker 6>interpreters of the catastrophes of Nazi</v>
<v Speaker 6>as Admin and and the Soviet Union,</v>

1265
01:12:17.850 --> 01:12:18.683
<v Speaker 6>both of their conclusions was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The fundamental problem with both both </v>

1266
01:12:21.301 --> 01:12:24.900
<v Speaker 6>of those systems is that the individuals</v>
<v Speaker 6>within the systems allowed themselves to</v>

1267
01:12:24.901 --> 01:12:27.570
<v Speaker 6>be corrupted by what was in their own </v>
<v Speaker 6>hearts.</v>

1268
01:12:28.110 --> 01:12:30.690
<v Speaker 6>And so one of the things that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>absolutely horrible,</v>

1269
01:12:30.691 --> 01:12:31.524
<v Speaker 6>I think about the Marxist and </v>
<v Speaker 6>postmodernist viewpoint is that it </v>

1270
01:12:34.261 --> 01:12:39.261
<v Speaker 6>doesn't attribute any of the pathology </v>
<v Speaker 6>that's all all projected onto the social</v>

1271
01:12:39.331 --> 01:12:41.940
<v Speaker 6>world to the individual,</v>
<v Speaker 6>him or herself.</v>

1272
01:12:42.210 --> 01:12:44.490
<v Speaker 6>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well that's where the fundamental battle</v>

1273
01:12:44.491 --> 01:12:45.324
<v Speaker 6>takes place.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I would also say that the idea that </v>

1274
01:12:47.970 --> 01:12:48.803
<v Speaker 6>existence is a battle between good and </v>
<v Speaker 6>evil and it's the battle of the soul is </v>

1275
01:12:52.081 --> 01:12:56.250
<v Speaker 6>a consequence of the symbolic </v>
<v Speaker 6>realization of Western civilization.</v>

1276
01:12:56.460 --> 01:12:57.293
<v Speaker 6>That the evil that has to be confronted </v>
<v Speaker 6>most forthrightly as actually the </v>

1277
01:13:00.271 --> 01:13:04.350
<v Speaker 6>individual that obtains that evil that </v>
<v Speaker 6>obtains to the individual.</v>

1278
01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:08.850
<v Speaker 6>And that it's primarily an ethical issue</v>
<v Speaker 6>at the individual level.</v>

1279
01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.130
<v Speaker 6>And that's what you take responsibility </v>
<v Speaker 6>for.</v>

1280
01:13:11.131 --> 01:13:11.964
<v Speaker 6>It.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you forget that you projected on to </v>

1281
01:13:13.051 --> 01:13:13.884
<v Speaker 6>other people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you take no responsibility for it and </v>

1282
01:13:15.781 --> 01:13:17.760
<v Speaker 6>you end up thinking that you're the good</v>
<v Speaker 6>guy.</v>

1283
01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:18.893
<v Speaker 6>And you probably shouldn't think that </v>
<v Speaker 6>because if you thought for about 15 </v>

1284
01:13:21.691 --> 01:13:24.570
<v Speaker 6>minutes about all the stupid things that</v>
<v Speaker 6>you've done in your life,</v>

1285
01:13:24.780 --> 01:13:25.613
<v Speaker 6>you could add malevolent things as well.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You could figure out for yourself quite </v>

1286
01:13:28.801 --> 01:13:29.634
<v Speaker 6>quickly that the probability that you're</v>
<v Speaker 6>the saint and that everyone else is the </v>

1287
01:13:32.521 --> 01:13:33.660
<v Speaker 6>villain is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is,</v>

1288
01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:38.220
<v Speaker 6>is only an indication of precisely how </v>
<v Speaker 6>villainous you are.</v>

1289
01:13:39.330 --> 01:13:40.163
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then with regards to the social </v>

1290
01:13:41.281 --> 01:13:42.114
<v Speaker 6>structure,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well obviously it's pathological and </v>

1291
01:13:43.711 --> 01:13:45.810
<v Speaker 6>tyrannical and corrupted,</v>
<v Speaker 6>deceitful,</v>

1292
01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:46.860
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

1293
01:13:46.860 --> 01:13:47.693
<v Speaker 6>it's partly a structure of the dad and </v>
<v Speaker 6>people are corrupt to some degree and </v>

1294
01:13:51.571 --> 01:13:52.590
<v Speaker 6>willfully blind.</v>

1295
01:13:52.860 --> 01:13:55.620
<v Speaker 6>And so that's an archetypal truth.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's part of the throne.</v>

1296
01:13:55.621 --> 01:13:57.000
<v Speaker 6>This,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that we discussed earlier,</v>

1297
01:13:57.180 --> 01:13:58.013
<v Speaker 6>you have this infrastructure that </v>
<v Speaker 6>surrounds you both physical and </v>

1298
01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:04.020
<v Speaker 6>conceptual and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's beneficiary and its victim.</v>

1299
01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:07.990
<v Speaker 6>It's partly pathological and corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's always been that way.</v>

1300
01:14:07.991 --> 01:14:12.310
<v Speaker 6>And you're damn lucky that it isn't just</v>
<v Speaker 6>purely corrupt because that's frequently</v>

1301
01:14:12.311 --> 01:14:13.144
<v Speaker 6>the case.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so what your job is not to whine </v>

1302
01:14:15.071 --> 01:14:17.590
<v Speaker 6>about the fact that it's corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's self evident.</v>

1303
01:14:17.830 --> 01:14:21.910
<v Speaker 6>You're job is to straighten yourself up </v>
<v Speaker 6>enough so that you can straighten up the</v>

1304
01:14:21.911 --> 01:14:22.744
<v Speaker 6>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's the old motif of rescuing </v>

1305
01:14:25.241 --> 01:14:27.700
<v Speaker 6>your father from the belly of the whale,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let's say,</v>

1306
01:14:27.701 --> 01:14:28.534
<v Speaker 6>which is part of the necessary process </v>
<v Speaker 6>by which people become fully developed </v>

1307
01:14:33.131 --> 01:14:33.964
<v Speaker 6>individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What you're supposed to be doing in </v>

1308
01:14:34.961 --> 01:14:36.580
<v Speaker 6>university,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in the humanities.</v>

1309
01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:41.980
<v Speaker 6>You don't just study the great ideas of </v>
<v Speaker 6>Western culture [inaudible] you just,</v>

1310
01:14:42.010 --> 01:14:42.843
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you study the pathology of history and </v>

1311
01:14:44.831 --> 01:14:46.240
<v Speaker 6>know that it's about you.</v>

1312
01:14:46.510 --> 01:14:47.343
<v Speaker 6>And then maybe you try to culture </v>
<v Speaker 6>yourself and discipline yourself to the </v>

1313
01:14:50.291 --> 01:14:51.124
<v Speaker 6>point where you have enough of an </v>
<v Speaker 6>internal ethic so that when you take </v>

1314
01:14:54.431 --> 01:14:58.210
<v Speaker 6>your place in the patriarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for lack of a better word,</v>

1315
01:14:58.270 --> 01:15:01.570
<v Speaker 6>you're going to be a force for good </v>
<v Speaker 6>rather than a force for evil.</v>

1316
01:15:01.690 --> 01:15:02.523
<v Speaker 6>And then maybe the damn thing tilts a </v>
<v Speaker 6>bit towards the good instead of the </v>

1317
01:15:05.620 --> 01:15:06.453
<v Speaker 6>catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then maybe you've done something </v>

1318
01:15:08.081 --> 01:15:11.890
<v Speaker 6>that's worthwhile and then nature.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1319
01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:13.233
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you,</v>

1320
01:15:13.390 --> 01:15:14.223
<v Speaker 6>it's very easy to romanticize nature,</v>
<v Speaker 6>especially if you're a city dweller </v>

1321
01:15:17.711 --> 01:15:19.540
<v Speaker 6>who's never had to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1322
01:15:19.930 --> 01:15:20.763
<v Speaker 6>wander out in the northern woods in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>middle of the summer and get eaten by </v>

1323
01:15:23.471 --> 01:15:24.304
<v Speaker 6>black flies and mosquitoes starving to </v>
<v Speaker 6>death while trying to track down an </v>

1324
01:15:27.521 --> 01:15:30.910
<v Speaker 6>animal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's very easy to romanticize nature.</v>

1325
01:15:30.911 --> 01:15:31.744
<v Speaker 6>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 6>cancer and other diseases tend to </v>

1326
01:15:33.431 --> 01:15:36.130
<v Speaker 6>disabuse you of the pure beauty of </v>
<v Speaker 6>nature.</v>

1327
01:15:36.460 --> 01:15:39.400
<v Speaker 6>And nature is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 6>very destructive force.</v>

1328
01:15:39.401 --> 01:15:40.234
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's against us all the time as well as </v>

1329
01:15:41.951 --> 01:15:45.220
<v Speaker 6>for us.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And another thing that's really not well</v>

1330
01:15:45.221 --> 01:15:46.054
<v Speaker 6>balanced in our society is the anti </v>
<v Speaker 6>humanism that's become part and parcel </v>

1331
01:15:50.020 --> 01:15:54.370
<v Speaker 6>of radical discussions everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Human beings are regarded as a cancer on</v>

1332
01:15:54.371 --> 01:15:56.410
<v Speaker 6>the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>To quote the,</v>

1333
01:15:56.710 --> 01:15:58.480
<v Speaker 6>what was that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>The club of Rome,</v>

1334
01:15:58.780 --> 01:15:59.613
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>worrying about the population explosion </v>

1335
01:16:01.451 --> 01:16:02.284
<v Speaker 6>and we're all guilty because we're </v>
<v Speaker 6>destroying things as fast as we can </v>

1336
01:16:04.361 --> 01:16:06.460
<v Speaker 6>possibly manage.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like Jesus,</v>

1337
01:16:06.550 --> 01:16:08.980
<v Speaker 6>everything around us is always trying to</v>
<v Speaker 6>kill us.</v>

1338
01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:11.410
<v Speaker 6>Most of the time we're just trying to </v>
<v Speaker 6>stay alive.</v>

1339
01:16:11.620 --> 01:16:13.300
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're not perfect.</v>

1340
01:16:13.301 --> 01:16:17.020
<v Speaker 6>We're corrupt and sora social structures</v>
<v Speaker 6>and people get greedy and careless.</v>

1341
01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:18.153
<v Speaker 6>But it's not like nature's all shining a</v>
<v Speaker 6>wonderful young lady waiting in the </v>

1342
01:16:23.051 --> 01:16:23.884
<v Speaker 6>wilderness to embrace us positively.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's the old hag that's going to kill </v>

1343
01:16:27.401 --> 01:16:31.390
<v Speaker 6>you every possible way and you need to </v>
<v Speaker 6>defend yourself against that.</v>

1344
01:16:31.390 --> 01:16:32.223
<v Speaker 6>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>human beings have only been in a </v>

1345
01:16:33.491 --> 01:16:34.324
<v Speaker 6>position since 1960 since we ever had </v>
<v Speaker 6>any conceptualization of our potential </v>

1346
01:16:39.341 --> 01:16:42.130
<v Speaker 6>to change the planet on a planetary </v>
<v Speaker 6>scale.</v>

1347
01:16:42.250 --> 01:16:44.710
<v Speaker 6>It's been like four generations.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1348
01:16:44.711 --> 01:16:45.544
<v Speaker 6>back in the 1890s Thomas Huxley was </v>
<v Speaker 6>commissioned by the English parliament </v>

1349
01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:51.633
<v Speaker 6>to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to investigate the carrying capacity of </v>

1350
01:16:54.761 --> 01:16:56.890
<v Speaker 6>the oceans and his,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he was a great biologist.</v>

1351
01:16:57.070 --> 01:16:57.903
<v Speaker 6>His report was that there are so damn </v>
<v Speaker 6>many fish in the ocean that every human </v>

1352
01:17:01.241 --> 01:17:02.074
<v Speaker 6>being could fish every day for the rest </v>
<v Speaker 6>of his life and catch everything he </v>

1353
01:17:05.291 --> 01:17:08.230
<v Speaker 6>possibly could and we wouldn't put a </v>
<v Speaker 6>dent in it.</v>

1354
01:17:08.740 --> 01:17:09.381
<v Speaker 6>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1355
01:17:09.381 --> 01:17:10.214
<v Speaker 6>that's only 120 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We only woke up to the fact that we </v>

1356
01:17:12.921 --> 01:17:16.520
<v Speaker 6>became a planetary force in 1960 it's </v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

1357
01:17:16.521 --> 01:17:19.100
<v Speaker 6>what the hell do you expect from people?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1358
01:17:19.101 --> 01:17:23.900
<v Speaker 6>we're trying to get ourselves together </v>
<v Speaker 6>as fast as we can and might be decent of</v>

1359
01:17:23.901 --> 01:17:24.734
<v Speaker 6>us to stop with the anti human rhetoric,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is only going to lead to a bad </v>

1360
01:17:28.131 --> 01:17:28.870
<v Speaker 6>end.</v>

1361
01:17:28.870 --> 01:17:31.190
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if human beings are nothing but a cancer</v>

1362
01:17:31.191 --> 01:17:32.024
<v Speaker 6>on the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then it's the bloody hero who </v>

1363
01:17:33.081 --> 01:17:33.914
<v Speaker 6>obliterates them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Isn't that because it's the hero who </v>

1364
01:17:35.391 --> 01:17:36.224
<v Speaker 6>gets rid of cancer?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And when people watch the school </v>

1365
01:17:39.471 --> 01:17:41.360
<v Speaker 6>shooters in the mass shooters and they </v>
<v Speaker 6>think,</v>

1366
01:17:41.361 --> 01:17:42.194
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what is it that motivates people like </v>

1367
01:17:43.311 --> 01:17:44.144
<v Speaker 6>that in which they can figure out about </v>
<v Speaker 6>half an hour if they did the proper </v>

1368
01:17:46.851 --> 01:17:48.920
<v Speaker 6>reading,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just read what they wrote.</v>

1369
01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:52.490
<v Speaker 6>Human beings are a cancer on the planet </v>
<v Speaker 6>being as evil.</v>

1370
01:17:52.491 --> 01:17:53.324
<v Speaker 6>Intrinsically,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to take out everything I can </v>

1371
01:17:55.550 --> 01:17:56.383
<v Speaker 6>to show my displeasure with the </v>
<v Speaker 6>structure of reality and then I'm going </v>

1372
01:17:59.181 --> 01:18:02.270
<v Speaker 6>to shoot myself just to show you how </v>
<v Speaker 6>little I care.</v>

1373
01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:05.480
<v Speaker 6>And if you can't understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then you haven't looked very deeply into</v>

1374
01:18:05.481 --> 01:18:08.060
<v Speaker 6>your own heart because there could be a </v>
<v Speaker 6>time in your life.</v>

1375
01:18:08.061 --> 01:18:08.894
<v Speaker 6>Believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>where something terrible enough happens </v>

1376
01:18:10.311 --> 01:18:13.040
<v Speaker 6>to you so that you'll be able to </v>
<v Speaker 6>understand that perfectly.</v>

1377
01:18:17.180 --> 01:18:19.700
<v Speaker 6>Here's the Christian representation of </v>
<v Speaker 6>the same thing,</v>

1378
01:18:20.700 --> 01:18:22.640
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So the great mothers on the outside,</v>

1379
01:18:22.641 --> 01:18:25.550
<v Speaker 6>that's nature and then the fathers in </v>
<v Speaker 6>the middle.</v>

1380
01:18:25.551 --> 01:18:28.610
<v Speaker 6>And in that representation,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which I really liked,</v>

1381
01:18:28.611 --> 01:18:29.444
<v Speaker 6>that's from 13th century,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you see God the father who's a </v>

1382
01:18:32.391 --> 01:18:33.224
<v Speaker 6>representation of culture holding the </v>
<v Speaker 6>suffering individual who similar </v>

1383
01:18:37.131 --> 01:18:37.964
<v Speaker 6>caneously transcends his suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the goal to be the suffering </v>

1384
01:18:41.151 --> 01:18:44.240
<v Speaker 6>individual who simultaneously transcends</v>
<v Speaker 6>his suffering.</v>

1385
01:18:44.450 --> 01:18:47.300
<v Speaker 6>That's why all those people on the </v>
<v Speaker 6>inside of the open virgin,</v>

1386
01:18:47.301 --> 01:18:51.290
<v Speaker 6>which is what that sculpture is called,</v>
<v Speaker 6>our gazing at that image because they're</v>

1387
01:18:51.291 --> 01:18:53.450
<v Speaker 6>trying to figure out what the hell it </v>
<v Speaker 6>means.</v>

1388
01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:56.210
<v Speaker 6>While people have been gazing at it for </v>
<v Speaker 6>2000 years,</v>

1389
01:18:56.211 --> 01:18:57.044
<v Speaker 6>trying to figure out what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And one of the things that you can be </v>

1390
01:18:59.271 --> 01:19:00.104
<v Speaker 6>sure of is that that story and what that</v>
<v Speaker 6>image represents is absolutely central </v>

1391
01:19:03.681 --> 01:19:05.780
<v Speaker 6>to the integrity of Western </v>
<v Speaker 6>civilization.</v>

1392
01:19:10.930 --> 01:19:15.310
<v Speaker 6>Five more minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is an image of,</v>

1393
01:19:15.340 --> 01:19:16.173
<v Speaker 6>of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would call it the patriarchy and it's </v>

1394
01:19:18.031 --> 01:19:21.070
<v Speaker 6>a lot of lovely image.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's God the father and he's assimilated</v>

1395
01:19:21.071 --> 01:19:21.904
<v Speaker 6>to the sun because well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because consciousness which is </v>

1396
01:19:25.481 --> 01:19:27.830
<v Speaker 6>associated with light is the builder of </v>
<v Speaker 6>culture.</v>

1397
01:19:27.831 --> 01:19:28.670
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1398
01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:32.710
<v Speaker 6>he rules over the walled city.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so he's the centering idea.</v>

1399
01:19:32.711 --> 01:19:34.960
<v Speaker 6>You might say that that unites a </v>
<v Speaker 6>culture.</v>

1400
01:19:34.961 --> 01:19:37.510
<v Speaker 6>That's another way of looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he's got two hands.</v>

1401
01:19:37.750 --> 01:19:41.380
<v Speaker 6>I described them as security and tyranny</v>
<v Speaker 6>altogether order.</v>

1402
01:19:41.381 --> 01:19:43.720
<v Speaker 6>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you're in a university,</v>

1403
01:19:43.750 --> 01:19:45.910
<v Speaker 6>the U of t students complain about this </v>
<v Speaker 6>all the time,</v>

1404
01:19:45.911 --> 01:19:48.060
<v Speaker 6>they're 60,000 u of t student,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1405
01:19:48.061 --> 01:19:48.894
<v Speaker 6>They feel like numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they feel ignored and no wonder because </v>

1406
01:19:51.631 --> 01:19:52.464
<v Speaker 6>their numbers and they are ignored.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's no wonder they didn't feel that </v>

1407
01:19:54.751 --> 01:19:56.520
<v Speaker 6>way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1408
01:19:56.521 --> 01:20:00.270
<v Speaker 6>and there's huge classes of 1200 people </v>
<v Speaker 6>and they get lost and they think,</v>

1409
01:20:00.271 --> 01:20:01.104
<v Speaker 6>God,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's a pretty evil structure and </v>

1410
01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:03.180
<v Speaker 6>uncaring.</v>

1411
01:20:03.180 --> 01:20:04.020
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

1412
01:20:04.021 --> 01:20:06.360
<v Speaker 6>that's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But by the same token,</v>

1413
01:20:06.630 --> 01:20:07.463
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>get to purchase four years of </v>

1414
01:20:08.461 --> 01:20:09.294
<v Speaker 6>intellectual freedom and you have all </v>
<v Speaker 6>these people who could at least in </v>

1415
01:20:11.701 --> 01:20:12.534
<v Speaker 6>principle,</v>
<v Speaker 6>teach you something and you get an </v>

1416
01:20:13.771 --> 01:20:14.604
<v Speaker 6>identity out of the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And if you have half a half a bit of </v>

1417
01:20:16.981 --> 01:20:17.814
<v Speaker 6>sense here in the library trying to read</v>
<v Speaker 6>great things and maybe you're not quite </v>

1418
01:20:20.191 --> 01:20:23.280
<v Speaker 6>as dopey and useless when you come out </v>
<v Speaker 6>as you were when you went in.</v>

1419
01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:27.900
<v Speaker 6>And so it takes with one hand and gives </v>
<v Speaker 6>with the other and you got to understand</v>

1420
01:20:27.901 --> 01:20:30.450
<v Speaker 6>that about your position in relationship</v>
<v Speaker 6>to society.</v>

1421
01:20:30.630 --> 01:20:33.090
<v Speaker 6>It crushes you in molds you at the same </v>
<v Speaker 6>time,</v>

1422
01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:37.260
<v Speaker 6>it limits you and furthers your compute </v>
<v Speaker 6>capability at the same time.</v>

1423
01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:38.273
<v Speaker 6>And it's up to you to determine how to </v>
<v Speaker 6>establish a harmonious and productive </v>

1424
01:20:40.981 --> 01:20:44.850
<v Speaker 6>relationship with that because that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>one of the fundamental demands of life</v>

1425
01:20:48.220 --> 01:20:50.530
<v Speaker 6>that's sort of splits into these two </v>
<v Speaker 6>things.</v>

1426
01:20:52.780 --> 01:20:55.300
<v Speaker 6>That's the s the king who devours his </v>
<v Speaker 6>son.</v>

1427
01:20:55.330 --> 01:20:56.163
<v Speaker 6>I love that picture and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well that's a society that's become </v>

1428
01:20:59.231 --> 01:21:00.130
<v Speaker 6>tyrannical,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1429
01:21:00.131 --> 01:21:03.070
<v Speaker 6>I'm the son of the king is the thing </v>
<v Speaker 6>that regenerates the king,</v>

1430
01:21:03.490 --> 01:21:07.300
<v Speaker 6>the kings old and he's blind and he's </v>
<v Speaker 6>stupid and he's corrupt and he has a son</v>

1431
01:21:07.301 --> 01:21:10.180
<v Speaker 6>and the son is lively and awake and </v>
<v Speaker 6>alert and can see.</v>

1432
01:21:10.450 --> 01:21:11.283
<v Speaker 6>And if the father is not pathological,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then he tries to make the sun strong so </v>

1433
01:21:14.771 --> 01:21:17.500
<v Speaker 6>that the son can grow up and revitalize </v>
<v Speaker 6>the culture.</v>

1434
01:21:17.710 --> 01:21:19.570
<v Speaker 6>And if he's a tyrant,</v>
<v Speaker 6>weld any devours him.</v>

1435
01:21:19.571 --> 01:21:23.350
<v Speaker 6>And then he gets old and corrupt and </v>
<v Speaker 6>everything goes to into chaos.</v>

1436
01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:28.800
<v Speaker 6>And then there's the benevolent Kane </v>
<v Speaker 6>who's got that properly balanced.</v>

1437
01:21:29.441 --> 01:21:32.740
<v Speaker 6>And you see in this picture he's got a </v>
<v Speaker 6>globe but his hand with the cross on top</v>

1438
01:21:32.741 --> 01:21:33.574
<v Speaker 6>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's means the same thing that </v>

1439
01:21:35.260 --> 01:21:36.093
<v Speaker 6>other symbolic image did,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is that the proper society </v>

1440
01:21:39.161 --> 01:21:39.994
<v Speaker 6>supports the suffering individual in his</v>
<v Speaker 6>or her attempts to transcend their </v>

1441
01:21:43.781 --> 01:21:47.110
<v Speaker 6>suffering and attain a proper ethical </v>
<v Speaker 6>perspective.</v>

1442
01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.700
<v Speaker 6>And then the son of the father is the </v>
<v Speaker 6>hero.</v>

1443
01:21:51.701 --> 01:21:53.590
<v Speaker 6>That's Hercules'.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I really liked that picture.</v>

1444
01:21:53.591 --> 01:21:54.424
<v Speaker 6>So Hercules' goes out into the darkness </v>
<v Speaker 6>and he's got this container and maybe </v>

1445
01:21:57.461 --> 01:21:59.950
<v Speaker 6>you can think of that container as a </v>
<v Speaker 6>cultural artifact,</v>

1446
01:21:59.951 --> 01:22:00.784
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because the culture protects you from </v>

1447
01:22:02.231 --> 01:22:03.910
<v Speaker 6>chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then the question is,</v>

1448
01:22:03.911 --> 01:22:05.800
<v Speaker 6>what are you supposed to do with that </v>
<v Speaker 6>protection?</v>

1449
01:22:06.070 --> 01:22:09.430
<v Speaker 6>And the answer is you're supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 6>wear the garb of the lion,</v>

1450
01:22:09.431 --> 01:22:11.110
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the king of the beasts.</v>

1451
01:22:11.111 --> 01:22:11.944
<v Speaker 6>So that's supposed to be you and you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>supposed to go out there into the </v>

1452
01:22:14.201 --> 01:22:15.034
<v Speaker 6>darkness with your bloody eyes open so </v>
<v Speaker 6>you can discover what's in the darkness </v>

1453
01:22:17.591 --> 01:22:20.200
<v Speaker 6>and share with everyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he's got a club,</v>

1454
01:22:20.201 --> 01:22:22.510
<v Speaker 6>they're in his hands and the club was </v>
<v Speaker 6>covered with eyes.</v>

1455
01:22:22.540 --> 01:22:23.373
<v Speaker 6>Those are eyes not barbs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And what that means is that you should </v>

1456
01:22:25.631 --> 01:22:26.464
<v Speaker 6>bloody well pay attention and that well </v>
<v Speaker 6>the other element of that it's not </v>

1457
01:22:29.921 --> 01:22:32.710
<v Speaker 6>expressed in that image,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is that you should also speak carefully,</v>

1458
01:22:32.711 --> 01:22:34.660
<v Speaker 6>pay attention,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and speak carefully,</v>

1459
01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:35.793
<v Speaker 6>and then you're the proper son of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>proper farther and you can keep things </v>

1460
01:22:38.231 --> 01:22:41.170
<v Speaker 6>functioning and that makes you into </v>
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>

1461
01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:42.153
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1462
01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:45.470
<v Speaker 6>So the city is always threatened,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's always corrupted,</v>

1463
01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:46.353
<v Speaker 6>threatened,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and there's always something outside </v>

1464
01:22:47.561 --> 01:22:48.394
<v Speaker 6>that's going to take it down always.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's what's represented by the </v>

1465
01:22:51.371 --> 01:22:52.204
<v Speaker 6>Dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That little twist and its tail is </v>

1466
01:22:53.501 --> 01:22:54.334
<v Speaker 6>something that represents infinity and </v>
<v Speaker 6>the courageous individual goes out of </v>

1467
01:22:57.281 --> 01:22:58.114
<v Speaker 6>the damage city to confront the dragon </v>
<v Speaker 6>of chaos and to gain something valuable </v>

1468
01:23:02.501 --> 01:23:03.334
<v Speaker 6>as a consequence.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's what human are supposed to </v>

1469
01:23:06.041 --> 01:23:08.680
<v Speaker 6>do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's our destiny.</v>

1470
01:23:08.681 --> 01:23:09.514
<v Speaker 6>That's our soul.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a better way of thinking about </v>

1471
01:23:11.321 --> 01:23:13.960
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And some of that terrible dragon is just</v>

1472
01:23:13.961 --> 01:23:14.794
<v Speaker 6>the catastrophe and suffering of life </v>
<v Speaker 6>and our continual attempts to transcend </v>

1473
01:23:17.751 --> 01:23:18.584
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But a tremendous amount of it is also </v>

1474
01:23:19.871 --> 01:23:24.790
<v Speaker 6>the malevolence and the evil that exists</v>
<v Speaker 6>in our own hearts and in society.</v>

1475
01:23:24.791 --> 01:23:27.670
<v Speaker 6>And perhaps to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 6>even in the world itself,</v>

1476
01:23:27.850 --> 01:23:28.683
<v Speaker 6>you're supposed to wake up and </v>
<v Speaker 6>strengthen yourself and stand up </v>

1477
01:23:31.451 --> 01:23:32.284
<v Speaker 6>properly and fortify yourself so that </v>
<v Speaker 6>you're a light that can shine in the </v>

1478
01:23:35.651 --> 01:23:36.190
<v Speaker 6>darkness.</v>

1479
01:23:36.190 --> 01:23:39.610
<v Speaker 6>And that's something that can withstand </v>
<v Speaker 6>malevolence and tragedy.</v>

1480
01:23:40.330 --> 01:23:42.070
<v Speaker 6>And what,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what's your alternative?</v>

1481
01:23:42.250 --> 01:23:46.210
<v Speaker 6>You're going to let life crush you and </v>
<v Speaker 6>make you weak and make you resentful and</v>

1482
01:23:46.211 --> 01:23:47.044
<v Speaker 6>bitter and then murderous.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You'll take out your rage on everyone </v>

1483
01:23:49.751 --> 01:23:53.920
<v Speaker 6>you can and it will only be limited by </v>
<v Speaker 6>your capacity to obtain power.</v>

1484
01:23:54.130 --> 01:23:58.120
<v Speaker 6>That's not a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so it's this way or it's this way or</v>

1485
01:23:58.121 --> 01:23:58.954
<v Speaker 6>a way that leads directly to hell.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And we've certainly seen that plenty of </v>

1486
01:24:02.021 --> 01:24:02.854
<v Speaker 6>times in the last hundred years and </v>
<v Speaker 6>you'd think we might have learned our </v>

1487
01:24:05.321 --> 01:24:08.620
<v Speaker 6>lesson,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it takes a lot for people to learn.</v>

1488
01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:12.370
<v Speaker 6>And we're in danger of repeating exactly</v>
<v Speaker 6>the same mistakes again.</v>

1489
01:24:15.990 --> 01:24:16.920
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1490
01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:18.593
<v Speaker 6>it's one thing to complain about the </v>
<v Speaker 6>political polarization and it's another </v>

1491
01:24:21.181 --> 01:24:24.490
<v Speaker 6>thing to point fingers out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The postmodernist send the Neo Marxists,</v>

1492
01:24:24.491 --> 01:24:25.324
<v Speaker 6>Steven though they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they roundly deserve it in my </v>

1493
01:24:28.471 --> 01:24:29.304
<v Speaker 6>estimation.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's another thing to try to figure out </v>

1494
01:24:31.381 --> 01:24:34.530
<v Speaker 6>what the proper alternative isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The proper alternative is not,</v>

1495
01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:38.220
<v Speaker 6>in my estimation,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to contribute to political polarization.</v>

1496
01:24:38.730 --> 01:24:39.563
<v Speaker 6>It's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it's not that the radical right is </v>

1497
01:24:41.281 --> 01:24:44.730
<v Speaker 6>the solution to the radical left.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just another catastrophe.</v>

1498
01:24:45.150 --> 01:24:47.430
<v Speaker 6>And the only solution that I've been </v>
<v Speaker 6>able to figure out,</v>

1499
01:24:47.431 --> 01:24:50.340
<v Speaker 6>and this is as a consequence of much </v>
<v Speaker 6>reading and much thinking,</v>

1500
01:24:50.341 --> 01:24:51.174
<v Speaker 6>is that it's up to the individuals in </v>
<v Speaker 6>our society is sort themselves out into </v>

1501
01:24:54.900 --> 01:24:59.280
<v Speaker 6>strengthen themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to become wise and alert and to shoulder</v>

1502
01:24:59.281 --> 01:25:02.070
<v Speaker 6>the responsibility of being and the </v>
<v Speaker 6>demand,</v>

1503
01:25:02.071 --> 01:25:02.904
<v Speaker 6>the ethical demand to pushback </v>
<v Speaker 6>malevolence in their own hearts and in </v>

1504
01:25:05.401 --> 01:25:06.234
<v Speaker 6>their society.</v>

1505
01:25:06.510 --> 01:25:08.550
<v Speaker 6>And I also believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1506
01:25:08.551 --> 01:25:09.384
<v Speaker 6>it's very difficult for people to </v>
<v Speaker 6>respect themselves because they're weak </v>

1507
01:25:12.031 --> 01:25:14.670
<v Speaker 6>and vulnerable and pathetic and </v>
<v Speaker 6>malevolent.</v>

1508
01:25:14.850 --> 01:25:16.950
<v Speaker 6>And so it's no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and they're not what they could be.</v>

1509
01:25:16.951 --> 01:25:17.784
<v Speaker 6>And they know it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so it's no wonder that people don't </v>

1510
01:25:19.141 --> 01:25:21.360
<v Speaker 6>respect themselves and some of that </v>
<v Speaker 6>nature.</v>

1511
01:25:21.361 --> 01:25:24.000
<v Speaker 6>And some of that's culture and some of </v>
<v Speaker 6>it's individual weakness.</v>

1512
01:25:24.420 --> 01:25:25.253
<v Speaker 6>But one of the things that I've learned,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and it's about the only optimistic </v>

1513
01:25:27.481 --> 01:25:28.314
<v Speaker 6>thought I've ever come across,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is that if you have enough courage to </v>

1514
01:25:31.171 --> 01:25:32.004
<v Speaker 6>forthrightly,</v>
<v Speaker 6>except the fact that you're vulnerable </v>

1515
01:25:33.991 --> 01:25:37.500
<v Speaker 6>and malevolent and you're willing to do </v>
<v Speaker 6>something about it to overcome it,</v>

1516
01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:38.513
<v Speaker 6>you can develop enough respect for </v>
<v Speaker 6>yourself so that the terrible weight of </v>

1517
01:25:41.101 --> 01:25:43.950
<v Speaker 6>being will not make you mlevel intend </v>
<v Speaker 6>corrupt.</v>

1518
01:25:44.700 --> 01:25:45.533
<v Speaker 6>And I don't think that you have anything</v>
<v Speaker 6>better to aim for unless you want blood </v>

1519
01:25:47.971 --> 01:25:48.804
<v Speaker 6>in the streets in a pathetic life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so you might as well straighten up </v>

1520
01:25:51.781 --> 01:25:52.614
<v Speaker 6>and get your act together.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And maybe we've got some chance of </v>

1521
01:25:54.811 --> 01:25:55.644
<v Speaker 6>getting through this intermediary period</v>
<v Speaker 6>of chaos that we all face and make </v>

1522
01:25:58.771 --> 01:26:01.050
<v Speaker 6>something better out of it instead of </v>
<v Speaker 6>something worse.</v>

1523
01:26:01.620 --> 01:26:04.430
<v Speaker 6>So that's what have to say about that.</v>

1524
01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:05.750
<v Speaker 7>So thank you.</v>

1525
01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:11.160
<v Speaker 8>[inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 8>I've talked to Peterson has agreed to do</v>

1526
01:26:33.991 --> 01:26:35.740
<v Speaker 8>with 30 minutes of question and answers </v>
<v Speaker 8>still.</v>

1527
01:26:35.750 --> 01:26:40.750
<v Speaker 8>So,</v>
<v Speaker 8>okay.</v>

1528
01:26:48.220 --> 01:26:50.710
<v Speaker 7>So why should just unplug it or shut off</v>
<v Speaker 7>the recording?</v>

1529
01:26:52.470 --> 01:26:53.303
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

1530
01:26:57.280 --> 01:26:58.300
<v Speaker 7>Oh yes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yes.</v>

1531
01:26:58.340 --> 01:26:59.173
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

1532
01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:07.793
<v Speaker 8>Sure.</v>

1533
01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:09.580
<v Speaker 7>I'll repeat your question.</v>

1534
01:27:13.690 --> 01:27:14.523
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So I heard that you decided not to do </v>

1535
01:27:16.521 --> 01:27:17.354
<v Speaker 8>your,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

1536
01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:19.113
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>website thing to analyze the postmodern </v>

1537
01:27:21.261 --> 01:27:22.094
<v Speaker 8>his forces and you said that you thought</v>
<v Speaker 8>that it would contribute more and </v>

1538
01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:25.353
<v Speaker 8>polarization.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I had lunch with a friend of mine </v>

1539
01:27:27.201 --> 01:27:28.034
<v Speaker 8>earlier today who I hadn't seen in 70 </v>
<v Speaker 8>years on the radical left and it will </v>

1540
01:27:31.191 --> 01:27:32.024
<v Speaker 8>probably be a victim of that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 8>thing if you were to be successful on </v>

1541
01:27:34.651 --> 01:27:35.484
<v Speaker 8>that are in many of them,</v>
<v Speaker 8>let's say the shut out of the </v>

1542
01:27:38.481 --> 01:27:39.750
<v Speaker 8>university.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>

1543
01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:41.900
<v Speaker 8>so that seems right to me.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's a bad way to go.</v>

1544
01:27:41.901 --> 01:27:44.120
<v Speaker 8>But what do you think of as the </v>
<v Speaker 8>alternative?</v>

1545
01:27:44.220 --> 01:27:45.053
<v Speaker 8>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You've talked to a lot of people who </v>

1546
01:27:45.981 --> 01:27:49.520
<v Speaker 8>were sort of in your intellectual orbit </v>
<v Speaker 8>who are kind of fellow travelers.</v>

1547
01:27:49.720 --> 01:27:52.920
<v Speaker 8>Do you think the answer is to talk to </v>
<v Speaker 8>people who are further away from you and</v>

1548
01:27:52.921 --> 01:27:54.650
<v Speaker 8>have you tried to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm sure many,</v>

1549
01:27:55.190 --> 01:27:57.040
<v Speaker 8>many people made it would be your life.</v>

1550
01:27:57.780 --> 01:27:58.920
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You might say that.</v>

1551
01:27:58.921 --> 01:27:59.754
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Reluctant would be one way of putting </v>

1552
01:28:00.751 --> 01:28:01.770
<v Speaker 7>it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1553
01:28:01.860 --> 01:28:03.780
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so the question is,</v>

1554
01:28:04.500 --> 01:28:08.070
<v Speaker 7>I had thought about making a website,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well the website was actually made,</v>

1555
01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:08.993
<v Speaker 7>cause you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if I'm trying to decide whether to do </v>

1556
01:28:10.171 --> 01:28:11.610
<v Speaker 7>something,</v>
<v Speaker 7>usually what I do,</v>

1557
01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:12.473
<v Speaker 7>because it's really hard to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 7>if you should do something just </v>

1558
01:28:13.891 --> 01:28:15.000
<v Speaker 7>hypothetically.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

1559
01:28:15.390 --> 01:28:16.223
<v Speaker 7>So one of the ways to figure out if you </v>
<v Speaker 7>should do something is to do it almost </v>

1560
01:28:18.871 --> 01:28:22.470
<v Speaker 7>completely and then it's there and then </v>
<v Speaker 7>you're actually thinking about something</v>

1561
01:28:22.471 --> 01:28:23.304
<v Speaker 7>real.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I talked to a bunch of people about </v>

1562
01:28:24.931 --> 01:28:25.764
<v Speaker 7>it after it was built and thought that I</v>
<v Speaker 7>wasn't sure it would cause more that </v>

1563
01:28:30.811 --> 01:28:34.710
<v Speaker 7>would do more good than harm.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So I put it on hiatus now.</v>

1564
01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:36.000
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1565
01:28:36.001 --> 01:28:36.834
<v Speaker 7>one of the unfortunate things that </v>
<v Speaker 7>happened was that the University of </v>

1566
01:28:40.590 --> 01:28:42.660
<v Speaker 7>Toronto Faculty Association accused me </v>
<v Speaker 7>of making this website,</v>

1567
01:28:43.050 --> 01:28:43.883
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>on the basis of things I'd said about </v>

1568
01:28:45.121 --> 01:28:47.430
<v Speaker 7>three or four months ago without talking</v>
<v Speaker 7>to me about it.</v>

1569
01:28:47.430 --> 01:28:48.263
<v Speaker 7>Because why would they talk to one of </v>
<v Speaker 7>their faculty members being the Faculty </v>

1570
01:28:52.170 --> 01:28:53.010
<v Speaker 7>Association.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

1571
01:28:53.430 --> 01:28:54.780
<v Speaker 7>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so I would,</v>

1572
01:28:54.840 --> 01:28:56.060
<v Speaker 7>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

1573
01:28:56.100 --> 01:28:56.933
<v Speaker 7>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was wavering back and forth about </v>

1574
01:28:58.951 --> 01:29:03.190
<v Speaker 7>whether to not to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then they came out and attacked me.</v>

1575
01:29:03.191 --> 01:29:06.190
<v Speaker 7>And the problem with that is that now if</v>
<v Speaker 7>I say I'm not going to do it,</v>

1576
01:29:06.191 --> 01:29:08.740
<v Speaker 7>it looks like they won.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And that's,</v>

1577
01:29:08.770 --> 01:29:09.603
<v Speaker 7>and first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't see this as a win loss </v>

1578
01:29:10.931 --> 01:29:11.764
<v Speaker 7>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't like it to be construed that </v>

1579
01:29:13.331 --> 01:29:15.880
<v Speaker 7>way.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But the truth of the matter is,</v>

1580
01:29:15.881 --> 01:29:18.520
<v Speaker 7>is that when the faculty association </v>
<v Speaker 7>came out and said that,</v>

1581
01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:20.650
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it would be wrong for me to do it,</v>

1582
01:29:20.651 --> 01:29:22.380
<v Speaker 7>my first response was,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1583
01:29:22.390 --> 01:29:25.120
<v Speaker 7>you bastards all be doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now you can be sure of that.</v>

1584
01:29:25.570 --> 01:29:28.090
<v Speaker 7>But that's not a good,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's not how to think,</v>

1585
01:29:28.091 --> 01:29:28.360
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1586
01:29:28.360 --> 01:29:30.580
<v Speaker 7>That's how to react.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so you don't do that.</v>

1587
01:29:30.581 --> 01:29:33.430
<v Speaker 7>You have your little emotional meltdown </v>
<v Speaker 7>and then you,</v>

1588
01:29:33.700 --> 01:29:38.700
<v Speaker 7>you think for like a month and you get </v>
<v Speaker 7>people to talk to and you try to come at</v>

1589
01:29:38.771 --> 01:29:41.350
<v Speaker 7>it from a level headed perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>

1590
01:29:41.870 --> 01:29:43.060
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>

1591
01:29:43.061 --> 01:29:47.050
<v Speaker 7>I probably have most luck with youtube </v>
<v Speaker 7>videos and I have a book coming out.</v>

1592
01:29:47.390 --> 01:29:49.240
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm supposed to bring a flyer for all of</v>

1593
01:29:49.241 --> 01:29:50.170
<v Speaker 7>you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but you know,</v>

1594
01:29:50.230 --> 01:29:51.200
<v Speaker 7>I forgot.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>

1595
01:29:51.670 --> 01:29:53.770
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like I always do.</v>

1596
01:29:53.920 --> 01:29:55.390
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

1597
01:29:55.510 --> 01:29:56.343
<v Speaker 7>and hopefully that'll be helpful because</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's about individual responsibility </v>

1598
01:29:59.921 --> 01:30:00.800
<v Speaker 7>fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And,</v>

1599
01:30:00.950 --> 01:30:04.090
<v Speaker 7>and truth in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which I think is,</v>

1600
01:30:06.310 --> 01:30:07.870
<v Speaker 7>what would you say?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1601
01:30:07.871 --> 01:30:08.704
<v Speaker 7>if you want to adapt to reality,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is kind of what you have to do </v>

1602
01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:13.233
<v Speaker 7>then falsifying it is probably not the </v>
<v Speaker 7>most effective strategy as far as I can </v>

1603
01:30:17.351 --> 01:30:18.184
<v Speaker 7>tell.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And it's certainly the case that if you </v>

1604
01:30:19.091 --> 01:30:19.924
<v Speaker 7>allow yourself to speak bent words that </v>
<v Speaker 7>you'll end up with a bent character and </v>

1605
01:30:23.651 --> 01:30:25.930
<v Speaker 7>then God help you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>

1606
01:30:26.770 --> 01:30:27.603
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I talked tonight about what I think are </v>

1607
01:30:28.811 --> 01:30:31.150
<v Speaker 7>the words that are most dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 7>diversity,</v>

1608
01:30:31.151 --> 01:30:33.100
<v Speaker 7>equity,</v>
<v Speaker 7>inclusivity,</v>

1609
01:30:33.430 --> 01:30:35.980
<v Speaker 7>white privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So maybe you know,</v>

1610
01:30:35.981 --> 01:30:36.814
<v Speaker 7>the people who are watching the videos </v>
<v Speaker 7>can think about how they might want to </v>

1611
01:30:40.541 --> 01:30:41.374
<v Speaker 7>orient themselves in relationship to the</v>
<v Speaker 7>mid level bureaucrats in particular who </v>

1612
01:30:45.161 --> 01:30:45.994
<v Speaker 7>are pushing this sort of thing forward </v>
<v Speaker 7>with as much force as they can possibly </v>

1613
01:30:48.461 --> 01:30:51.630
<v Speaker 7>manage.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So we'll see.</v>

1614
01:30:52.140 --> 01:30:54.970
<v Speaker 7>That's that's the plan at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yep.</v>

1615
01:30:59.160 --> 01:31:02.610
<v Speaker 7>You never know.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Hello,</v>

1616
01:31:07.340 --> 01:31:08.230
<v Speaker 9>any of the lecture</v>

1617
01:31:13.500 --> 01:31:14.470
<v Speaker 7>or at least the ones who,</v>

1618
01:31:19.020 --> 01:31:21.920
<v Speaker 9>I was wondering if you could talk about </v>
<v Speaker 9>this.</v>

1619
01:31:23.050 --> 01:31:23.883
<v Speaker 9>Ideas that are not the cookie cutter one</v>
<v Speaker 9>left and the leftist students like I </v>

1620
01:31:29.461 --> 01:31:31.400
<v Speaker 9>have today.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm talking about people like me,</v>

1621
01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:36.370
<v Speaker 9>they board though they are some,</v>
<v Speaker 9>some of them steeped in Marxism.</v>

1622
01:31:36.760 --> 01:31:37.593
<v Speaker 9>The do have validity in the sense that </v>
<v Speaker 9>though we have this thrown this from </v>

1623
01:31:41.861 --> 01:31:42.694
<v Speaker 9>heidegger,</v>
<v Speaker 9>there are power hierarchies and </v>

1624
01:31:45.161 --> 01:31:45.994
<v Speaker 9>structures.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Though admittedly not all powerful that </v>

1625
01:31:48.341 --> 01:31:49.174
<v Speaker 9>do define human interactions that do </v>
<v Speaker 9>dominate people and that do in a sense </v>

1626
01:31:53.290 --> 01:31:56.500
<v Speaker 9>or at least in their words,</v>
<v Speaker 9>alienate people from themselves.</v>

1627
01:31:57.040 --> 01:31:59.680
<v Speaker 9>Probably the most prominent papers and </v>
<v Speaker 9>the medium is message,</v>

1628
01:32:00.130 --> 01:32:00.963
<v Speaker 9>which is what I'm talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 9>which is the production of new </v>

1629
01:32:02.981 --> 01:32:03.814
<v Speaker 9>technologies,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the technology itself and the content </v>

1630
01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:07.433
<v Speaker 9>producers.</v>
<v Speaker 9>We can think of newspaper articles in </v>

1631
01:32:09.221 --> 01:32:11.740
<v Speaker 9>the newspaper,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the distribution of newspapers.</v>

1632
01:32:11.770 --> 01:32:16.540
<v Speaker 9>Is it self content as well and how that </v>
<v Speaker 9>defines power structures within people?</v>

1633
01:32:16.890 --> 01:32:17.723
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the first thing is is that it's not </v>

1634
01:32:18.751 --> 01:32:19.584
<v Speaker 7>particularly useful necessarily to </v>
<v Speaker 7>conceptualize them as power structures </v>

1635
01:32:22.950 --> 01:32:26.220
<v Speaker 7>because there are structures with </v>
<v Speaker 7>multiple purposes and there are multiple</v>

1636
01:32:26.221 --> 01:32:29.760
<v Speaker 7>structures and so collapsing it to </v>
<v Speaker 7>powers of very bad idea.</v>

1637
01:32:30.330 --> 01:32:31.163
<v Speaker 7>The second is that we're in a human </v>
<v Speaker 7>beings are in a constant state of </v>

1638
01:32:34.771 --> 01:32:37.980
<v Speaker 7>alienation from the world and from what </v>
<v Speaker 7>they produce.</v>

1639
01:32:37.981 --> 01:32:39.210
<v Speaker 7>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's what human,</v>

1640
01:32:39.270 --> 01:32:42.300
<v Speaker 7>if you had to define human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that would be the definition.</v>

1641
01:32:42.420 --> 01:32:46.530
<v Speaker 7>Those creatures that are in a constant </v>
<v Speaker 7>state of alienation from themselves,</v>

1642
01:32:46.531 --> 01:32:49.950
<v Speaker 7>culture and the world.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now why that is exactly.</v>

1643
01:32:49.951 --> 01:32:50.784
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think it has something to do with the </v>

1644
01:32:51.871 --> 01:32:52.704
<v Speaker 7>fact that were self conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it's an existential reality rather </v>

1645
01:32:55.831 --> 01:32:56.664
<v Speaker 7>than a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>an indication of the pathology of a </v>

1646
01:32:58.801 --> 01:33:01.800
<v Speaker 7>given cultural construction.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know that,</v>

1647
01:33:01.801 --> 01:33:03.180
<v Speaker 7>that's one of the reasons I really </v>
<v Speaker 7>liked,</v>

1648
01:33:03.210 --> 01:33:04.800
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Heidi groove in part,</v>

1649
01:33:04.801 --> 01:33:07.800
<v Speaker 7>but the existentialist in general,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they just throw that out in front of you</v>

1650
01:33:07.801 --> 01:33:08.634
<v Speaker 7>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>look,</v>

1651
01:33:08.820 --> 01:33:11.070
<v Speaker 7>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>of course you have those problems.</v>

1652
01:33:11.370 --> 01:33:12.203
<v Speaker 7>Like that's it's always been that way.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The ancient Egyptians had a god that </v>

1653
01:33:15.811 --> 01:33:18.810
<v Speaker 7>represented the corrupting,</v>
<v Speaker 7>their corrupt,</v>

1654
01:33:18.930 --> 01:33:19.763
<v Speaker 7>the corruption of the state,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and the corrupting influence that </v>

1655
01:33:21.841 --> 01:33:26.160
<v Speaker 7>produced that corruption that was set </v>
<v Speaker 7>and set is the set,</v>

1656
01:33:26.161 --> 01:33:28.590
<v Speaker 7>the word sad eventually becomes the word</v>
<v Speaker 7>Satan.</v>

1657
01:33:28.650 --> 01:33:29.910
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we've known this,</v>

1658
01:33:30.330 --> 01:33:31.163
<v Speaker 7>the Mesopotamians knew this.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They had a god king knew who was the </v>

1659
01:33:33.811 --> 01:33:37.050
<v Speaker 7>king of the monsters out of whose blood </v>
<v Speaker 7>to human beings were made.</v>

1660
01:33:37.410 --> 01:33:40.710
<v Speaker 7>It's like the idea that we're alienated </v>
<v Speaker 7>from what we create.</v>

1661
01:33:40.711 --> 01:33:41.544
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

1662
01:33:41.550 --> 01:33:42.570
<v Speaker 7>right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Absolutely.</v>

1663
01:33:42.571 --> 01:33:45.450
<v Speaker 7>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So get up and do something about it.</v>

1664
01:33:45.900 --> 01:33:46.421
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's,</v>

1665
01:33:46.421 --> 01:33:51.180
<v Speaker 7>it's not like you're unique in your </v>
<v Speaker 7>subjugation to the pathology of culture.</v>

1666
01:33:51.450 --> 01:33:54.390
<v Speaker 7>And it's also not the case that culture </v>
<v Speaker 7>is only pathological.</v>

1667
01:33:54.630 --> 01:33:57.480
<v Speaker 7>That's the other thing that's so that's </v>
<v Speaker 7>so disturbing.</v>

1668
01:33:57.840 --> 01:33:59.820
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you have glasses on,</v>

1669
01:34:00.270 --> 01:34:01.290
<v Speaker 7>that's a good thing.</v>

1670
01:34:01.350 --> 01:34:03.780
<v Speaker 7>You don't bump into walls,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1671
01:34:03.781 --> 01:34:06.150
<v Speaker 7>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and that's a cultural artifact,</v>

1672
01:34:06.180 --> 01:34:07.013
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and I'd be dead six times over if it </v>

1673
01:34:08.401 --> 01:34:11.100
<v Speaker 7>wasn't for various medical </v>
<v Speaker 7>interventions.</v>

1674
01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:12.810
<v Speaker 7>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1675
01:34:12.930 --> 01:34:13.763
<v Speaker 7>leaving the fact that you're oppressed </v>
<v Speaker 7>with a little bit of gratitude is a </v>

1676
01:34:16.890 --> 01:34:20.070
<v Speaker 7>really wonderful thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And one of the things that just staggers</v>

1677
01:34:20.071 --> 01:34:22.650
<v Speaker 7>me about the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the radical fringe that's,</v>

1678
01:34:22.920 --> 01:34:26.310
<v Speaker 7>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's characterized by these ideas that</v>

1679
01:34:26.311 --> 01:34:27.144
<v Speaker 7>we discussed tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They have absolutely no gratitude for </v>

1680
01:34:29.071 --> 01:34:31.530
<v Speaker 7>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And that's really something remarkable.</v>

1681
01:34:32.070 --> 01:34:32.903
<v Speaker 7>You know what it needs to say human </v>
<v Speaker 7>being is intolerable unless he has two </v>

1682
01:34:36.061 --> 01:34:38.280
<v Speaker 7>things.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Cleanliness and gratitude.</v>

1683
01:34:38.580 --> 01:34:40.620
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>maybe they manage the first count,</v>

1684
01:34:40.621 --> 01:34:42.960
<v Speaker 7>although not always,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but they certainly do.</v>

1685
01:34:43.830 --> 01:34:44.663
<v Speaker 7>Sorry about that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But they certainly don't manage this </v>

1686
01:34:49.161 --> 01:34:50.880
<v Speaker 7>second.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So</v>

1687
01:34:52.950 --> 01:34:53.783
<v Speaker 9>Yup.</v>

1688
01:34:56.340 --> 01:34:58.010
<v Speaker 7>You bring up article written</v>

1689
01:34:58.010 --> 01:34:58.843
<v Speaker 8>in the day,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the car note papers published this </v>

1690
01:35:01.700 --> 01:35:02.533
<v Speaker 8>morning,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a letter to the editor by a farm of the </v>

1691
01:35:04.900 --> 01:35:07.010
<v Speaker 8>student government,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the legislative affairs committee,</v>

1692
01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:10.160
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>in which they make several clams,</v>

1693
01:35:10.550 --> 01:35:11.383
<v Speaker 8>which I think you could use.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And what struck me as an attempt to </v>

1694
01:35:16.041 --> 01:35:16.874
<v Speaker 8>slander you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>things that happened with the </v>

1695
01:35:19.221 --> 01:35:20.660
<v Speaker 8>[inaudible] team building,</v>
<v Speaker 8>things like that.</v>

1696
01:35:21.260 --> 01:35:23.760
<v Speaker 8>But they make the assertion that you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

1697
01:35:23.900 --> 01:35:24.733
<v Speaker 8>essentially abuse or hide behind the </v>
<v Speaker 8>banner or free speech in order to be </v>

1698
01:35:30.621 --> 01:35:35.621
<v Speaker 8>safe or to allow ourselves</v>
<v Speaker 8>to not adopt the ideas thrown out.</v>

1699
01:35:38.961 --> 01:35:43.130
<v Speaker 8>But I think this could be extended to </v>
<v Speaker 8>all types of speech in which the radical</v>

1700
01:35:43.131 --> 01:35:43.760
<v Speaker 8>lessons,</v>

1701
01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:46.700
<v Speaker 7>I wouldn't say I'm hiding behind the </v>
<v Speaker 7>banner of free speech.</v>

1702
01:35:46.701 --> 01:35:47.534
<v Speaker 7>Precisely.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So that would be the first error in </v>

1703
01:35:49.311 --> 01:35:50.144
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't think that you can characterize </v>

1704
01:35:51.531 --> 01:35:54.020
<v Speaker 7>what I'm doing is hiding.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It isn't,</v>

1705
01:35:54.110 --> 01:35:58.910
<v Speaker 7>it isn't exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it isn't exactly self evident that um,</v>

1706
01:35:59.150 --> 01:36:01.490
<v Speaker 7>the right to free speech has protected </v>
<v Speaker 7>me.</v>

1707
01:36:01.610 --> 01:36:04.070
<v Speaker 7>I would say a certain amount of good </v>
<v Speaker 7>fortune,</v>

1708
01:36:04.310 --> 01:36:05.143
<v Speaker 7>a certain amount of caution with my </v>
<v Speaker 7>words and a tremendous amount of public </v>

1709
01:36:07.971 --> 01:36:10.530
<v Speaker 7>support is what's protected me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

1710
01:36:10.700 --> 01:36:15.700
<v Speaker 7>I also think that the ideological types </v>
<v Speaker 7>who pen those pieces of nonsense have,</v>

1711
01:36:16.421 --> 01:36:19.430
<v Speaker 7>have a common,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what a constant theme is.</v>

1712
01:36:19.550 --> 01:36:24.550
<v Speaker 7>Anyone who disagrees with them is </v>
<v Speaker 7>pathological in some manner and uses the</v>

1713
01:36:25.431 --> 01:36:28.340
<v Speaker 7>right of free speech to exercise that </v>
<v Speaker 7>pathology.</v>

1714
01:36:28.490 --> 01:36:29.323
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1715
01:36:29.390 --> 01:36:31.160
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's just,</v>

1716
01:36:31.220 --> 01:36:32.360
<v Speaker 7>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>sorry,</v>

1717
01:36:32.361 --> 01:36:35.150
<v Speaker 7>that's not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's not the case.</v>

1718
01:36:35.151 --> 01:36:35.984
<v Speaker 7>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>most of what's been leveled at me in </v>

1719
01:36:37.821 --> 01:36:42.821
<v Speaker 7>terms of slurs are they're low </v>
<v Speaker 7>resolution and ill informed.</v>

1720
01:36:42.950 --> 01:36:44.240
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm a trans fold by,</v>

1721
01:36:44.241 --> 01:36:45.680
<v Speaker 7>I'm a bigot.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What else?</v>

1722
01:36:45.681 --> 01:36:47.660
<v Speaker 7>I'm a racist.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm a Nazi.</v>

1723
01:36:47.661 --> 01:36:48.494
<v Speaker 7>That's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'd been teaching about Nazi-ism for 30 </v>

1724
01:36:51.261 --> 01:36:52.280
<v Speaker 7>years,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1725
01:36:52.310 --> 01:36:53.143
<v Speaker 7>trying to tell people that they probably</v>
<v Speaker 7>would have been Nazi's had they been in </v>

1726
01:36:57.260 --> 01:36:58.093
<v Speaker 7>Germany during the 1930s,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is at actually trying to convince </v>

1727
01:37:00.861 --> 01:37:03.980
<v Speaker 7>them of that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is something that you might need a</v>

1728
01:37:03.981 --> 01:37:06.500
<v Speaker 7>trigger warning for before you entered </v>
<v Speaker 7>the class.</v>

1729
01:37:07.220 --> 01:37:08.031
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so it's,</v>

1730
01:37:08.031 --> 01:37:09.920
<v Speaker 7>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's palpably absurd,</v>

1731
01:37:10.280 --> 01:37:14.900
<v Speaker 7>but it doesn't matter because if the war</v>
<v Speaker 7>of ideas is about power,</v>

1732
01:37:14.901 --> 01:37:18.500
<v Speaker 7>it doesn't matter whether you represent </v>
<v Speaker 7>either side with any degree of accuracy,</v>

1733
01:37:18.501 --> 01:37:20.630
<v Speaker 7>it's just part of the hobbsy in </v>
<v Speaker 7>nightmare.</v>

1734
01:37:20.631 --> 01:37:24.770
<v Speaker 7>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>whoever spins the best story wins.</v>

1735
01:37:25.400 --> 01:37:27.590
<v Speaker 7>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Anyways,</v>

1736
01:37:27.591 --> 01:37:28.424
<v Speaker 7>I've been weirdly fortunate because </v>
<v Speaker 7>every time the radicals have come after </v>

1737
01:37:32.961 --> 01:37:36.140
<v Speaker 7>me and they really came after me last </v>
<v Speaker 7>October,</v>

1738
01:37:36.630 --> 01:37:39.800
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's reversed every single time.</v>

1739
01:37:40.430 --> 01:37:41.263
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and I'm not counting on that to </v>

1740
01:37:42.771 --> 01:37:47.000
<v Speaker 7>continue,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it's been rather blackley comical as</v>

1741
01:37:47.001 --> 01:37:51.410
<v Speaker 7>it's been occurring.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So these articles,</v>

1742
01:37:51.411 --> 01:37:53.180
<v Speaker 7>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>as far as I'm concerned,</v>

1743
01:37:53.830 --> 01:37:56.460
<v Speaker 7>they're a dime a dozen.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't even have to read them anymore.</v>

1744
01:37:56.850 --> 01:37:58.320
<v Speaker 7>That's the thing about reading </v>
<v Speaker 7>something,</v>

1745
01:37:58.321 --> 01:37:59.154
<v Speaker 7>an ideolog rights.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You just have to look at the first </v>

1746
01:38:01.261 --> 01:38:04.770
<v Speaker 7>sentence and infer the rest.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know it's true,</v>

1747
01:38:04.771 --> 01:38:05.590
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's actually,</v>

1748
01:38:05.590 --> 01:38:06.423
<v Speaker 7>this is one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 7>Solzhenitsyn did a brilliant job of </v>

1749
01:38:08.551 --> 01:38:10.740
<v Speaker 7>analyzing in the Gulag archipelago.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He said,</v>

1750
01:38:11.190 --> 01:38:14.980
<v Speaker 7>that's the consequence of turning your </v>
<v Speaker 7>God given sole over to human dogma.</v>

1751
01:38:15.240 --> 01:38:18.450
<v Speaker 7>You're just a puppet for these ideas </v>
<v Speaker 7>that are operating behind the scenes.</v>

1752
01:38:18.570 --> 01:38:22.110
<v Speaker 7>You think you have the ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like think again.</v>

1753
01:38:22.860 --> 01:38:23.693
<v Speaker 7>They have you and they're doing with you</v>
<v Speaker 7>what the idea is want to have done with </v>

1754
01:38:27.481 --> 01:38:29.130
<v Speaker 7>you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And when they're done with you,</v>

1755
01:38:29.131 --> 01:38:30.120
<v Speaker 7>they'll discard you.</v>

1756
01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:30.953
<v Speaker 7>You can be sure,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and you'll be lucky if there's anything </v>

1757
01:38:32.761 --> 01:38:35.370
<v Speaker 7>left of you when that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>

1758
01:38:35.820 --> 01:38:38.220
<v Speaker 7>and the universities are absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 7>complicit in this.</v>

1759
01:38:38.221 --> 01:38:41.250
<v Speaker 7>They take young people whose minds are,</v>
<v Speaker 7>are,</v>

1760
01:38:41.430 --> 01:38:43.890
<v Speaker 7>who are looking for an identity and no </v>
<v Speaker 7>wonder,</v>

1761
01:38:44.310 --> 01:38:45.143
<v Speaker 7>and they teach them this algorithmic </v>
<v Speaker 7>idiocy that anyone with any brain could </v>

1762
01:38:48.241 --> 01:38:53.190
<v Speaker 7>learn in a week that that dictums and </v>
<v Speaker 7>dogma of the oppression versus,</v>

1763
01:38:53.191 --> 01:38:54.360
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>pressed narrative,</v>

1764
01:38:54.630 --> 01:38:56.310
<v Speaker 7>God,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's unbelievable.</v>

1765
01:38:56.550 --> 01:38:57.383
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a decent chat Bot could write most of </v>

1766
01:38:59.251 --> 01:39:01.590
<v Speaker 7>the postmodern papers.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's why,</v>

1767
01:39:02.010 --> 01:39:04.680
<v Speaker 7>that's why they,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's why the typical humanities,</v>

1768
01:39:04.681 --> 01:39:08.970
<v Speaker 7>80% of humanities papers now garner zero</v>
<v Speaker 7>citations,</v>

1769
01:39:09.090 --> 01:39:09.923
<v Speaker 7>which means the only person who ever </v>
<v Speaker 7>reads them as the person who wrote them </v>

1770
01:39:12.660 --> 01:39:15.600
<v Speaker 7>and even they don't do a very good job </v>
<v Speaker 7>of reading them.</v>

1771
01:39:16.290 --> 01:39:17.123
<v Speaker 7>So</v>

1772
01:39:17.930 --> 01:39:21.490
<v Speaker 8>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

1773
01:39:21.491 --> 01:39:25.210
<v Speaker 8>for starters now I feel terrible for </v>
<v Speaker 8>writing that article.</v>

1774
01:39:25.340 --> 01:39:30.340
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

1775
01:39:36.530 --> 01:39:37.363
<v Speaker 8>no written with others and I would have </v>
<v Speaker 8>hoped it would have come across as more </v>

1776
01:39:39.491 --> 01:39:40.690
<v Speaker 8>of a thoughtful critique.</v>

1777
01:39:43.150 --> 01:39:44.650
<v Speaker 7>Are you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>are you actually serious?</v>

1778
01:39:48.870 --> 01:39:49.681
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm sorry,</v>

1779
01:39:49.681 --> 01:39:50.514
<v Speaker 7>I was a little hard on you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I would say I'm more hard on your </v>

1780
01:39:54.651 --> 01:39:56.180
<v Speaker 7>professors,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so</v>

1781
01:39:56.800 --> 01:39:58.750
<v Speaker 8>it's fun in a glutton for punishment,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but anyway,</v>

1782
01:39:59.100 --> 01:40:01.400
<v Speaker 7>it's very brave of you to be standing </v>
<v Speaker 7>there by way</v>

1783
01:40:06.030 --> 01:40:10.110
<v Speaker 8>more about identity.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Really what you see then in the sense of</v>

1784
01:40:10.111 --> 01:40:12.930
<v Speaker 8>thrown this is it's a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 8>human nature.</v>

1785
01:40:12.931 --> 01:40:13.764
<v Speaker 8>Human nature creates higher fees and </v>
<v Speaker 8>higher who's exclude or groups exclude </v>

1786
01:40:17.790 --> 01:40:18.623
<v Speaker 8>necessary to sort.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But what we see with a lot of the </v>

1787
01:40:20.811 --> 01:40:25.260
<v Speaker 8>sorting is that it's arbitrary and that </v>
<v Speaker 8>it's not the arbitrariness of nature,</v>

1788
01:40:25.261 --> 01:40:29.370
<v Speaker 8>but rather the arbitrary of structures </v>
<v Speaker 8>of society.</v>

1789
01:40:29.460 --> 01:40:30.293
<v Speaker 8>Like maybe nature lends itself to the </v>
<v Speaker 8>creation of arbitrary structures within </v>

1790
01:40:35.101 --> 01:40:37.850
<v Speaker 8>society.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think that's fair.</v>

1791
01:40:38.190 --> 01:40:39.023
<v Speaker 8>Then people self identify with these </v>
<v Speaker 8>categories and these categories maybe </v>

1792
01:40:42.630 --> 01:40:43.463
<v Speaker 8>outdated or based on old understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 8>These are ultimately lead to greater </v>

1793
01:40:49.831 --> 01:40:54.100
<v Speaker 8>estrangement.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So the question is how do people</v>

1794
01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:58.580
<v Speaker 10>reckon with the parts of their identity </v>
<v Speaker 10>that may or may not contribute</v>

1795
01:40:58.640 --> 01:41:01.670
<v Speaker 7>to environments where people feel more </v>
<v Speaker 7>estranged,</v>

1796
01:41:01.680 --> 01:41:02.513
<v Speaker 7>more alone.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's why you get educated is to </v>

1797
01:41:05.011 --> 01:41:07.680
<v Speaker 7>separate the wheat from the chaff.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

1798
01:41:07.681 --> 01:41:09.810
<v Speaker 7>because you're a historical creature,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1799
01:41:09.870 --> 01:41:10.703
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's outside of you and inside of you </v>

1800
01:41:12.360 --> 01:41:14.910
<v Speaker 7>and some of it's dead and corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 7>as you just said,</v>

1801
01:41:15.240 --> 01:41:17.430
<v Speaker 7>and his strangers for no reason,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

1802
01:41:17.431 --> 01:41:19.500
<v Speaker 7>no functional reason counter </v>
<v Speaker 7>productively,</v>

1803
01:41:19.980 --> 01:41:22.950
<v Speaker 7>but until you can,</v>
<v Speaker 7>until you understand the structures,</v>

1804
01:41:23.310 --> 01:41:24.143
<v Speaker 7>for better or for worse,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're in no position to to do anything </v>

1805
01:41:27.571 --> 01:41:28.404
<v Speaker 7>but make them more fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The purpose of a liberal education is </v>

1806
01:41:31.830 --> 01:41:36.830
<v Speaker 7>not to turn you into an Avatar of </v>
<v Speaker 7>capitalism or or,</v>

1807
01:41:36.841 --> 01:41:41.280
<v Speaker 7>or of or of democracy for that matter.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The purpose of a liberal education is to</v>

1808
01:41:41.281 --> 01:41:45.720
<v Speaker 7>enable you to comprehend the history in </v>
<v Speaker 7>which you're embedded and then to act as</v>

1809
01:41:45.721 --> 01:41:46.554
<v Speaker 7>an agent to,</v>
<v Speaker 7>to reconstruct and revitalize that </v>

1810
01:41:49.561 --> 01:41:50.394
<v Speaker 7>hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But that's a serious matter like at 18 </v>

1811
01:41:53.850 --> 01:41:54.683
<v Speaker 7>say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and right out of high school with no </v>

1812
01:41:57.631 --> 01:42:00.060
<v Speaker 7>experience whatsoever in life and no </v>
<v Speaker 7>real education.</v>

1813
01:42:00.260 --> 01:42:01.093
<v Speaker 7>You're in absolutely no position </v>
<v Speaker 7>whatsoever to be protesting about the </v>

1814
01:42:04.141 --> 01:42:06.660
<v Speaker 7>structure of the Western world.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>

1815
01:42:07.350 --> 01:42:09.150
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>
<v Speaker 7>sorry.</v>

1816
01:42:10.200 --> 01:42:11.033
<v Speaker 7>You know your,</v>
<v Speaker 7>your observations about the fact that </v>

1817
01:42:12.931 --> 01:42:15.990
<v Speaker 7>people are alienated by structures like </v>
<v Speaker 7>absolutely.</v>

1818
01:42:16.170 --> 01:42:19.110
<v Speaker 7>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And it does sort and it sorts harshly.</v>

1819
01:42:19.320 --> 01:42:20.730
<v Speaker 7>And of course,</v>
<v Speaker 7>because you're young,</v>

1820
01:42:20.731 --> 01:42:21.564
<v Speaker 7>you tend to be sorted near the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Except that I would point out that </v>

1821
01:42:24.181 --> 01:42:26.550
<v Speaker 7>you're young and there's really </v>
<v Speaker 7>something to that.</v>

1822
01:42:26.940 --> 01:42:27.773
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and you might think that you have no </v>

1823
01:42:28.381 --> 01:42:30.270
<v Speaker 7>power because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But I could say,</v>

1824
01:42:30.271 --> 01:42:31.104
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you have all the power that youth gives </v>

1825
01:42:32.281 --> 01:42:37.281
<v Speaker 7>you and that's not trivial.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So where power doesn't lie,</v>

1826
01:42:37.591 --> 01:42:39.150
<v Speaker 7>where it's obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1827
01:42:39.180 --> 01:42:40.013
<v Speaker 7>it really doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And people have more power than they </v>

1828
01:42:42.001 --> 01:42:43.500
<v Speaker 7>think,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but they squander it.</v>

1829
01:42:44.070 --> 01:42:47.910
<v Speaker 7>And he often squandered on ideology when</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're not just wasting their time.</v>

1830
01:42:48.520 --> 01:42:49.353
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1831
01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:52.650
<v Speaker 7>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was very brave of you to stand up and</v>

1832
01:42:52.651 --> 01:42:55.380
<v Speaker 7>ask me a question and to take all of </v>
<v Speaker 7>that criticism.</v>

1833
01:42:55.600 --> 01:43:00.600
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

1834
01:43:05.870 --> 01:43:06.703
<v Speaker 10>none or religious,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the phrase the carefully positioned in </v>

1835
01:43:12.061 --> 01:43:15.400
<v Speaker 10>the diagnostic atheism,</v>
<v Speaker 10>there is no literal gun in the objective</v>

1836
01:43:15.401 --> 01:43:16.234
<v Speaker 10>universe or at least no gut humans would</v>
<v Speaker 10>be interested in is intellectually hard </v>

1837
01:43:19.631 --> 01:43:20.464
<v Speaker 10>of a sale.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Still there's good evidence for </v>

1838
01:43:22.091 --> 01:43:22.924
<v Speaker 10>religious behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 10>has an advantage produced by natural </v>

1839
01:43:24.671 --> 01:43:28.360
<v Speaker 10>selection.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Do you think that self critically acting</v>

1840
01:43:28.630 --> 01:43:29.463
<v Speaker 10>in a way as if God exists is efficient </v>
<v Speaker 10>to leverage evolutionary wisdom or it </v>

1841
01:43:34.090 --> 01:43:35.560
<v Speaker 10>must have religions,</v>
<v Speaker 10>articles of faith,</v>

1842
01:43:35.830 --> 01:43:36.663
<v Speaker 10>people,</v>
<v Speaker 10>Lehman defendant in the same manner as </v>

1843
01:43:38.051 --> 01:43:38.884
<v Speaker 10>literal facts?</v>

1844
01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:45.280
<v Speaker 7>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 7>One of the things that I read when I was</v>

1845
01:43:46.371 --> 01:43:47.480
<v Speaker 7>reading Karl,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yo,</v>

1846
01:43:47.570 --> 01:43:48.403
<v Speaker 7>he made this claim,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which I really liked was that whatever </v>

1847
01:43:50.430 --> 01:43:53.960
<v Speaker 7>sits atop of your pinnacle of value is </v>
<v Speaker 7>functionally equivalent to God.</v>

1848
01:43:55.010 --> 01:43:56.810
<v Speaker 7>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's really smart.</v>

1849
01:43:56.950 --> 01:43:59.240
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and I like it smarter than it sounds,</v>

1850
01:43:59.241 --> 01:44:00.074
<v Speaker 7>which is the case with most of the </v>
<v Speaker 7>things that you wrote because it </v>

1851
01:44:02.091 --> 01:44:02.924
<v Speaker 7>actually does turn out that our category</v>
<v Speaker 7>systems are not so much about </v>

1852
01:44:06.441 --> 01:44:10.280
<v Speaker 7>subdividing the material world into it's</v>
<v Speaker 7>appropriate entities,</v>

1853
01:44:10.281 --> 01:44:11.114
<v Speaker 7>but about carving up our experience into</v>
<v Speaker 7>categories of tools and obstacles so </v>

1854
01:44:15.231 --> 01:44:19.880
<v Speaker 7>that we can attain certain valued goals.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so we're always directing our action</v>

1855
01:44:19.881 --> 01:44:20.714
<v Speaker 7>towards the attainment of a goal.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so that means we're immersed in a </v>

1856
01:44:23.031 --> 01:44:23.864
<v Speaker 7>value structure.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so young's point was whatever sits </v>

1857
01:44:26.301 --> 01:44:30.470
<v Speaker 7>at the pinnacle of your value structure </v>
<v Speaker 7>serves the function of God.</v>

1858
01:44:30.770 --> 01:44:32.870
<v Speaker 7>Now you might have a fragmented value </v>
<v Speaker 7>structure,</v>

1859
01:44:32.871 --> 01:44:36.110
<v Speaker 7>which means in some sense that you're </v>
<v Speaker 7>psychologically polytheistic.</v>

1860
01:44:36.470 --> 01:44:40.040
<v Speaker 7>And the problem with that is that then </v>
<v Speaker 7>you're a house divided amongst itself.</v>

1861
01:44:40.130 --> 01:44:42.380
<v Speaker 7>You're pulling in multiple directions </v>
<v Speaker 7>simultaneously.</v>

1862
01:44:42.500 --> 01:44:44.300
<v Speaker 7>Impulsive people are like that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1863
01:44:44.690 --> 01:44:45.523
<v Speaker 7>And they don't understand themselves </v>
<v Speaker 7>because one day they go left and the </v>

1864
01:44:48.020 --> 01:44:49.340
<v Speaker 7>other day they go right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And you know,</v>

1865
01:44:49.341 --> 01:44:50.174
<v Speaker 7>they,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they have no control over themselves at </v>

1866
01:44:50.991 --> 01:44:53.360
<v Speaker 7>all.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now you said,</v>

1867
01:44:53.361 --> 01:44:55.070
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's no objective God,</v>

1868
01:44:55.310 --> 01:44:58.430
<v Speaker 7>and that seems to be a reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 7>hypothesis.</v>

1869
01:44:58.790 --> 01:44:59.623
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the question then I suppose becomes to </v>

1870
01:45:01.371 --> 01:45:03.770
<v Speaker 7>what degree our subjective experience is</v>
<v Speaker 7>real.</v>

1871
01:45:03.771 --> 01:45:06.110
<v Speaker 7>And that's a matter of definition.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

1872
01:45:06.860 --> 01:45:07.693
<v Speaker 7>I think the religious impulse is an </v>
<v Speaker 7>inevitable consequence of the fact that </v>

1873
01:45:11.121 --> 01:45:11.954
<v Speaker 7>it's necessary for people to live inside</v>
<v Speaker 7>hierarchies of value and that we feel a </v>

1874
01:45:15.711 --> 01:45:20.510
<v Speaker 7>sense of awe.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The sense of all we feel with regards to</v>

1875
01:45:20.511 --> 01:45:21.344
<v Speaker 7>the highest values is no not </v>
<v Speaker 7>distinguishable from the existence of </v>

1876
01:45:24.861 --> 01:45:27.170
<v Speaker 7>the value itself now.</v>

1877
01:45:27.170 --> 01:45:31.190
<v Speaker 7>And there's real advantages to the idea </v>
<v Speaker 7>of a detached God in some sense.</v>

1878
01:45:31.191 --> 01:45:35.390
<v Speaker 7>And one of the things I've learned about</v>
<v Speaker 7>archaic concepts of sovereignty is that,</v>

1879
01:45:35.920 --> 01:45:36.753
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>detaching the idea of ethical of ethics </v>

1880
01:45:40.161 --> 01:45:40.994
<v Speaker 7>itself and ethical power from the holder</v>
<v Speaker 7>of power is an extraordinarily useful </v>

1881
01:45:45.351 --> 01:45:49.130
<v Speaker 7>thing to do because otherwise the cane </v>
<v Speaker 7>becomes the embodiment of the God.</v>

1882
01:45:49.370 --> 01:45:52.430
<v Speaker 7>And then the king can do no wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Then you have a tyrant.</v>

1883
01:45:52.760 --> 01:45:53.593
<v Speaker 7>If the idea of power and sovereignty is </v>
<v Speaker 7>detached from the individual and set up </v>

1884
01:45:59.331 --> 01:46:01.910
<v Speaker 7>as a higher virtue that even the </v>
<v Speaker 7>sovereign is,</v>

1885
01:46:02.030 --> 01:46:04.250
<v Speaker 7>is uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>responsible to them.</v>

1886
01:46:04.251 --> 01:46:06.350
<v Speaker 7>The sovereign,</v>
<v Speaker 7>at least in principle,</v>

1887
01:46:06.440 --> 01:46:09.950
<v Speaker 7>can never put,</v>
<v Speaker 7>put himself forward as absolute.</v>

1888
01:46:10.340 --> 01:46:11.173
<v Speaker 7>And you can think about that just as a </v>
<v Speaker 7>development of humans' capacity to </v>

1889
01:46:13.341 --> 01:46:14.390
<v Speaker 7>abstract,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1890
01:46:14.540 --> 01:46:15.373
<v Speaker 7>We can abstract the idea of sovereignty,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we can abstract the idea of ethics and </v>

1891
01:46:18.171 --> 01:46:19.004
<v Speaker 7>virtue.</v>

1892
01:46:19.010 --> 01:46:22.100
<v Speaker 7>We can,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we can hypothesize that as an ideal,</v>

1893
01:46:22.190 --> 01:46:23.023
<v Speaker 7>we can embody it as a personality,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is actually quite useful because </v>

1894
01:46:25.641 --> 01:46:28.220
<v Speaker 7>it's something we have to act out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now you might say,</v>

1895
01:46:28.221 --> 01:46:30.890
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what relationship does that have to,</v>

1896
01:46:31.520 --> 01:46:33.510
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>to the existence of,</v>

1897
01:46:33.920 --> 01:46:38.210
<v Speaker 7>of something transcendent in the </v>
<v Speaker 7>religious sense outside of that abstract</v>

1898
01:46:38.211 --> 01:46:39.044
<v Speaker 7>conceptualization.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And the answer to that is we don't know </v>

1899
01:46:41.930 --> 01:46:42.763
<v Speaker 7>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you familiarize yourself with the </v>

1900
01:46:45.471 --> 01:46:49.160
<v Speaker 7>writings of people who've had profound </v>
<v Speaker 7>religious experiences,</v>

1901
01:46:49.410 --> 01:46:50.243
<v Speaker 7>it's chronically the case that they </v>
<v Speaker 7>described encountering something that </v>

1902
01:46:53.221 --> 01:46:54.054
<v Speaker 7>transcends and that they describe it as </v>
<v Speaker 7>more real than anything they've ever </v>

1903
01:46:57.571 --> 01:46:58.890
<v Speaker 7>encountered.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now,</v>

1904
01:46:59.220 --> 01:47:02.850
<v Speaker 7>whether or not that constitutes proof,</v>
<v Speaker 7>depends on how you define proof.</v>

1905
01:47:03.210 --> 01:47:05.970
<v Speaker 7>So I'm not making a case for it one way </v>
<v Speaker 7>or another,</v>

1906
01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:09.480
<v Speaker 7>but I mean young himself,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean when he talked about God,</v>

1907
01:47:09.481 --> 01:47:11.730
<v Speaker 7>when he was being careful,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he didn't talk about God.</v>

1908
01:47:11.731 --> 01:47:12.564
<v Speaker 7>He talked about the God image in man and</v>
<v Speaker 7>he was careful never to formally state </v>

1909
01:47:18.541 --> 01:47:21.840
<v Speaker 7>that the fact that there's an image of </v>
<v Speaker 7>the ideal in the soul,</v>

1910
01:47:21.841 --> 01:47:22.674
<v Speaker 7>let's say an archetype that that </v>
<v Speaker 7>provided concrete proof that such an </v>

1911
01:47:26.791 --> 01:47:28.620
<v Speaker 7>ideal existed,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1912
01:47:28.621 --> 01:47:29.454
<v Speaker 7>in some transcendent manner.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But the world's a weird place and it's </v>

1913
01:47:32.101 --> 01:47:36.480
<v Speaker 7>not something I would rule out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So it's not like we understand the world</v>

1914
01:47:36.481 --> 01:47:38.840
<v Speaker 7>very well.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And materialists,</v>

1915
01:47:38.850 --> 01:47:39.750
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they try to,</v>

1916
01:47:40.570 --> 01:47:40.920
<v Speaker 8>yeah,</v>

1917
01:47:40.920 --> 01:47:41.753
<v Speaker 7>they tried to encapsulate the entire </v>
<v Speaker 7>world within the materialist philosophy </v>

1918
01:47:45.121 --> 01:47:45.954
<v Speaker 7>and like more power to them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's been an unbelievably successful </v>

1919
01:47:49.500 --> 01:47:50.333
<v Speaker 7>tool,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but we haven't cracked consciousness in </v>

1920
01:47:53.101 --> 01:47:53.934
<v Speaker 7>the least.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And there is something about </v>

1921
01:47:55.441 --> 01:47:56.274
<v Speaker 7>consciousness that's world creating and </v>
<v Speaker 7>there's something transcendent about </v>

1922
01:47:59.611 --> 01:48:03.270
<v Speaker 7>consciousness and it also seems capable </v>
<v Speaker 7>of a kind of infinite expansion.</v>

1923
01:48:03.750 --> 01:48:06.270
<v Speaker 7>And it isn't obvious why any of that is </v>
<v Speaker 7>the case.</v>

1924
01:48:06.330 --> 01:48:08.610
<v Speaker 7>Not obvious at all.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>

1925
01:48:10.290 --> 01:48:11.123
<v Speaker 8>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yup.</v>

1926
01:48:13.270 --> 01:48:15.760
<v Speaker 8>Hello?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

1927
01:48:16.300 --> 01:48:17.630
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So,</v>

1928
01:48:19.160 --> 01:48:24.160
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>okay.</v>

1929
01:48:28.690 --> 01:48:29.523
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Before they were writing this stuff up </v>

1930
01:48:32.220 --> 01:48:33.053
<v Speaker 8>for World War II was a critical theorist</v>
<v Speaker 8>criticizing Marxism itself and the </v>

1931
01:48:41.720 --> 01:48:44.350
<v Speaker 8>student</v>
<v Speaker 8>radicals in</v>

1932
01:48:47.340 --> 01:48:50.080
<v Speaker 8>Harvard,</v>
<v Speaker 8>mark up on the deck.</v>

1933
01:48:50.830 --> 01:48:55.760
<v Speaker 8>So those ideas seem to get bryce </v>
<v Speaker 8>section,</v>

1934
01:48:59.530 --> 01:49:02.950
<v Speaker 8>you don't really see eye to eye with how</v>
<v Speaker 8>smarter</v>

1935
01:49:05.730 --> 01:49:09.310
<v Speaker 8>objective realities.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So I mean what do you make of that?</v>

1936
01:49:09.311 --> 01:49:10.144
<v Speaker 8>People can,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we have tactic reality but the truth is </v>

1937
01:49:14.540 --> 01:49:15.373
<v Speaker 8>health and like they need like rebel </v>
<v Speaker 8>against the majority to express their </v>

1938
01:49:20.311 --> 01:49:21.144
<v Speaker 8>own throat.</v>

1939
01:49:21.870 --> 01:49:22.381
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>

1940
01:49:22.381 --> 01:49:24.840
<v Speaker 7>so two things.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean there's been a number of attempts</v>

1941
01:49:24.841 --> 01:49:26.730
<v Speaker 7>to revise Marx's theory,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1942
01:49:26.731 --> 01:49:27.564
<v Speaker 7>And so you pointed to one that's the </v>
<v Speaker 7>cultural theorists and that was after </v>

1943
01:49:30.511 --> 01:49:31.344
<v Speaker 7>World War II when it became painfully </v>
<v Speaker 7>obvious at least to the first round of </v>

1944
01:49:35.521 --> 01:49:36.354
<v Speaker 7>people who were oriented towards the </v>
<v Speaker 7>radical left but opened the rise that </v>

1945
01:49:39.811 --> 01:49:42.390
<v Speaker 7>there was something rotten in the state </v>
<v Speaker 7>of the Soviet Union.</v>

1946
01:49:42.960 --> 01:49:43.793
<v Speaker 7>And so they did a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they did their best to revamped the </v>

1947
01:49:47.891 --> 01:49:51.280
<v Speaker 7>central doctrines of Marxism using </v>
<v Speaker 7>[inaudible] and theory and so forth.</v>

1948
01:49:51.430 --> 01:49:52.270
<v Speaker 7>And yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>as you said,</v>

1949
01:49:52.271 --> 01:49:53.104
<v Speaker 7>they were very influential among the </v>
<v Speaker 7>student radicals of the 60s and it was </v>

1950
01:49:56.111 --> 01:49:58.930
<v Speaker 7>them that gave birth to the modern crop </v>
<v Speaker 7>of say,</v>

1951
01:49:58.931 --> 01:50:01.630
<v Speaker 7>postmodern Neo Marxists.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think that,</v>

1952
01:50:02.170 --> 01:50:03.003
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I couldn't cover all of that obviously </v>

1953
01:50:04.211 --> 01:50:05.740
<v Speaker 7>in one lecture,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but your,</v>

1954
01:50:05.800 --> 01:50:08.110
<v Speaker 7>your point is well taken.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

1955
01:50:09.370 --> 01:50:10.203
<v Speaker 7>now you had,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you ended that with a different </v>

1956
01:50:10.961 --> 01:50:12.850
<v Speaker 7>question.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>

1957
01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:16.000
<v Speaker 7>but I don't remember exactly what that </v>
<v Speaker 7>question was.</v>

1958
01:50:16.320 --> 01:50:17.840
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just,</v>

1959
01:50:18.330 --> 01:50:20.420
<v Speaker 1>people will track the benefit.</v>

1960
01:50:21.700 --> 01:50:23.530
<v Speaker 7>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well look,</v>

1961
01:50:23.531 --> 01:50:24.364
<v Speaker 7>I mean look,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the ultimate minority is the individual </v>

1962
01:50:28.690 --> 01:50:32.920
<v Speaker 7>and the individual always stands in </v>
<v Speaker 7>opposition with his or her truth to that</v>

1963
01:50:32.921 --> 01:50:33.754
<v Speaker 7>of the mob.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So that's true is that it's very </v>

1964
01:50:36.611 --> 01:50:37.444
<v Speaker 7>frequently the case that truth is held </v>
<v Speaker 7>by something outside the general </v>

1965
01:50:41.261 --> 01:50:44.050
<v Speaker 7>consensus.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now false hood is too,</v>

1966
01:50:44.280 --> 01:50:45.400
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>So I mean if you,</v>

1967
01:50:45.520 --> 01:50:48.070
<v Speaker 7>if you have a structure that's </v>
<v Speaker 7>reasonably functional,</v>

1968
01:50:48.190 --> 01:50:49.840
<v Speaker 7>new,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like a little walled city,</v>

1969
01:50:49.841 --> 01:50:53.380
<v Speaker 7>and you've got a hundred people outside </v>
<v Speaker 7>yelling about how pathological it is,</v>

1970
01:50:53.560 --> 01:50:54.393
<v Speaker 7>99 of them would make it worse.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And one of them has something useful to </v>

1971
01:50:58.091 --> 01:50:58.924
<v Speaker 7>say.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so you can't just dispense with the </v>

1972
01:51:00.701 --> 01:51:02.320
<v Speaker 7>minority,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so to speak,</v>

1973
01:51:02.350 --> 01:51:03.183
<v Speaker 7>because the majority of the minority is </v>
<v Speaker 7>going to be wrong in their opposition </v>

1974
01:51:07.060 --> 01:51:11.950
<v Speaker 7>because the one person in the minority </v>
<v Speaker 7>who isn't wrong is absolutely vital.</v>

1975
01:51:12.640 --> 01:51:13.473
<v Speaker 7>And that's the tension.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's always the tension between the </v>

1976
01:51:15.581 --> 01:51:15.910
<v Speaker 7>group.</v>

1977
01:51:15.910 --> 01:51:19.420
<v Speaker 7>That's partly the mythological hero </v>
<v Speaker 7>really has two roles.</v>

1978
01:51:19.421 --> 01:51:20.254
<v Speaker 7>One is to go out and conquer the dragon </v>
<v Speaker 7>of darkness and to gather information </v>

1979
01:51:23.831 --> 01:51:26.080
<v Speaker 7>and to disseminate it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But the second rule,</v>

1980
01:51:26.081 --> 01:51:26.914
<v Speaker 7>which is equally important,</v>
<v Speaker 7>is to stand up against the corrupt </v>

1981
01:51:29.561 --> 01:51:31.240
<v Speaker 7>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is what horace does.</v>

1982
01:51:31.241 --> 01:51:33.340
<v Speaker 7>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 7>in the ancient Egyptian stories,</v>

1983
01:51:33.880 --> 01:51:34.713
<v Speaker 7>demolish what's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what's corrupt and then rebuild </v>

1984
01:51:37.061 --> 01:51:38.980
<v Speaker 7>something and it's in,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's in.</v>

1985
01:51:38.981 --> 01:51:39.814
<v Speaker 7>It's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what in the aftermath you do that </v>

1986
01:51:41.711 --> 01:51:43.030
<v Speaker 7>psychologically too.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

1987
01:51:43.031 --> 01:51:43.864
<v Speaker 7>because you have an interpretive </v>
<v Speaker 7>structure through which you view the </v>

1988
01:51:46.781 --> 01:51:47.614
<v Speaker 7>world and now,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and then you run into something that's </v>

1989
01:51:50.170 --> 01:51:54.220
<v Speaker 7>like a minority,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a fact that doesn't fit and but it's,</v>

1990
01:51:54.250 --> 01:51:55.083
<v Speaker 7>but it's actually a fact that it </v>
<v Speaker 7>indicates that part of you needs to die </v>

1991
01:51:58.211 --> 01:51:59.044
<v Speaker 7>and</v>
<v Speaker 7>encounter chaos and reconstitute </v>

1992
01:52:02.231 --> 01:52:03.064
<v Speaker 7>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And that's why there is this dynamism </v>

1993
01:52:04.871 --> 01:52:05.704
<v Speaker 7>between the group and the individual and</v>
<v Speaker 7>also why the individual is held in the </v>

1994
01:52:10.181 --> 01:52:11.014
<v Speaker 7>west to be a power,</v>
<v Speaker 7>let's say that superordinate to the </v>

1995
01:52:14.201 --> 01:52:15.034
<v Speaker 7>state.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The state has to recognize the validity </v>

1996
01:52:17.081 --> 01:52:19.210
<v Speaker 7>of the individual because the individual</v>
<v Speaker 7>does,</v>

1997
01:52:19.270 --> 01:52:22.090
<v Speaker 7>in the final analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 7>hold the redemptive truth.</v>

1998
01:52:22.690 --> 01:52:25.930
<v Speaker 7>But to put that in minority groups,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's a whole different issue.</v>

1999
01:52:26.500 --> 01:52:28.570
<v Speaker 7>That's a slight of hand as far as I'm </v>
<v Speaker 7>concerned,</v>

2000
01:52:29.140 --> 01:52:31.400
<v Speaker 7>so.</v>
<v Speaker 7>All right.</v>

2001
01:52:31.770 --> 01:52:32.201
<v Speaker 7>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

2002
01:52:32.201 --> 01:52:32.840
<v Speaker 7>thank you.</v>

2003
01:52:32.840 --> 01:52:37.840
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>
