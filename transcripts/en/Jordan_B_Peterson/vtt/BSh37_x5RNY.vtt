1
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:07.910
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're going to wrap up Freud today.</v>

2
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.333
<v Speaker 1>So Freud</v>
<v Speaker 1>occupies a strange position in the </v>

3
00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:22.410
<v Speaker 1>history of psychology because Freud </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't a psychologist,</v>

4
00:00:22.411 --> 00:00:23.244
<v Speaker 1>he was a medical doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and many of the people whose theories </v>

5
00:00:26.821 --> 00:00:30.720
<v Speaker 1>were discussing that work clinicians </v>
<v Speaker 1>were mds,</v>

6
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:31.583
<v Speaker 1>not psychologists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then of course when Freud was </v>

7
00:00:33.361 --> 00:00:34.980
<v Speaker 1>around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least when he was trading,</v>

8
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.010
<v Speaker 1>psychology hadn't yet become an </v>
<v Speaker 1>independent science.</v>

9
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:39.683
<v Speaker 1>Now the same was true of Yom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and part of the consequence of that was </v>

10
00:00:42.901 --> 00:00:43.734
<v Speaker 1>that when the new science of psychology </v>
<v Speaker 1>developed into what you're studying </v>

11
00:00:47.701 --> 00:00:48.534
<v Speaker 1>today is psychoanalysts and the medical </v>
<v Speaker 1>community basically stayed outside of </v>

12
00:00:52.771 --> 00:00:54.750
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's never really been a</v>

13
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.083
<v Speaker 1>meeting of the minds between </v>
<v Speaker 1>experimental psychologists and </v>

14
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.923
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalysts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although by the 1980s the cognitive </v>

15
00:01:05.101 --> 00:01:09.720
<v Speaker 1>psychologists were promoting their </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovery of the cognitive unconscious,</v>

16
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.810
<v Speaker 1>which always felt to me a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>ungrateful given that Freud had actually</v>

17
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.860
<v Speaker 1>laid the groundwork for the theory of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the unconscious or an elaborated that in</v>

18
00:01:19.861 --> 00:01:21.870
<v Speaker 1>quite great detail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

19
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.000
<v Speaker 1>almost a hundred years before there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some resistance in this.</v>

20
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.990
<v Speaker 1>And that's what a psychoanalyst would </v>
<v Speaker 1>say.</v>

21
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.953
<v Speaker 1>There is some resistance among the </v>
<v Speaker 1>experimental psychology community to </v>

22
00:01:32.281 --> 00:01:34.620
<v Speaker 1>Credit Freud with any of his real </v>
<v Speaker 1>discoveries.</v>

23
00:01:34.621 --> 00:01:35.454
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's very unfortunate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because he did make the </v>

24
00:01:39.751 --> 00:01:41.130
<v Speaker 1>discoveries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And B,</v>

25
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.260
<v Speaker 1>the psychoanalysts still understand more</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the nature of the unconscious than</v>

26
00:01:46.261 --> 00:01:47.094
<v Speaker 1>modern experimental psychologists </v>
<v Speaker 1>because modern experimental </v>

27
00:01:49.861 --> 00:01:50.694
<v Speaker 1>psychologists insist on viewing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain as that cognitive processors </v>

28
00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:58.230
<v Speaker 1>something like a computer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that isn't what it is.</v>

29
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.850
<v Speaker 1>It's a living system composed of other </v>
<v Speaker 1>living subsystems.</v>

30
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.840
<v Speaker 1>And that means that as we've discussed </v>
<v Speaker 1>already,</v>

31
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.883
<v Speaker 1>that the human psyche and its </v>
<v Speaker 1>subordinate components are better </v>

32
00:02:12.391 --> 00:02:13.224
<v Speaker 1>conceived of as personalities and </v>
<v Speaker 1>subpersonalities then in any other </v>

33
00:02:17.011 --> 00:02:17.844
<v Speaker 1>manner then in systems or an or an </v>
<v Speaker 1>information or that information </v>

34
00:02:20.821 --> 00:02:23.160
<v Speaker 1>processing machines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

35
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.080
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

36
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.923
<v Speaker 1>I think perhaps the most fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>accomplishment of psycho analysis </v>

37
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.020
<v Speaker 1>following Nicha actually to view the </v>
<v Speaker 1>human mind,</v>

38
00:02:34.021 --> 00:02:39.021
<v Speaker 1>the human psyche as a place of </v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively integrated subpersonalities,</v>

39
00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.270
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean</v>

40
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.410
<v Speaker 1>when even when modern people talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>

41
00:02:46.411 --> 00:02:49.800
<v Speaker 1>they talk about the eye,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would be roughly the ego in Friday</v>

42
00:02:49.801 --> 00:02:50.634
<v Speaker 1>and terms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tend to think of themselves as a </v>

43
00:02:51.781 --> 00:02:52.614
<v Speaker 1>unitary.</v>

44
00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:53.753
<v Speaker 1>So nomina but</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem with that notion is that </v>

45
00:02:58.381 --> 00:02:59.214
<v Speaker 1>people continually do things that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>find themselves doing things that in </v>

46
00:03:02.381 --> 00:03:03.214
<v Speaker 1>principle they don't want to do or </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that they're ashamed of or lying </v>

47
00:03:06.611 --> 00:03:09.550
<v Speaker 1>when they don't want a liar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>generally misbehaving.</v>

48
00:03:09.551 --> 00:03:10.384
<v Speaker 1>And so also of course everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 1>observations that you can try to tell </v>

49
00:03:13.631 --> 00:03:16.540
<v Speaker 1>yourself what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't work very well.</v>

50
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.560
<v Speaker 1>So you know you've experienced this </v>
<v Speaker 1>undoubtedly in your own life many,</v>

51
00:03:20.561 --> 00:03:24.040
<v Speaker 1>many times when you're sitting down and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to study for something,</v>

52
00:03:24.041 --> 00:03:26.290
<v Speaker 1>particularly if you're not very </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in it,</v>

53
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:27.573
<v Speaker 1>they had all sorts of alternative </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibilities will make themselves </v>

54
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.070
<v Speaker 1>manifest in your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the theater of your,</v>

55
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.840
<v Speaker 1>of your imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in a sense what's happening in those</v>

56
00:03:37.841 --> 00:03:42.841
<v Speaker 1>situations is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>parts of you that that are organized,</v>

57
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.740
<v Speaker 1>organized around other goals or from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>authority perspective,</v>

58
00:03:47.741 --> 00:03:48.574
<v Speaker 1>say driven by other desires are trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to hijack control of your motor output </v>

59
00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:00.210
<v Speaker 1>and that frequently happens so that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>find yourself,</v>

60
00:04:00.791 --> 00:04:01.624
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>procrastinating or rationalizing or </v>

61
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.993
<v Speaker 1>displacing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are all Freudian concepts at </v>

62
00:04:09.251 --> 00:04:12.550
<v Speaker 1>displacement would be instead of doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the work you're supposed to do,</v>

63
00:04:12.551 --> 00:04:14.020
<v Speaker 1>you go off and do some other work.</v>

64
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.650
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a bad way of procrastinating,</v>

65
00:04:17.651 --> 00:04:18.484
<v Speaker 1>but it's not great because you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>focusing on what you should be focusing </v>

66
00:04:21.791 --> 00:04:22.624
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so in some sense you're at war with </v>

67
00:04:25.151 --> 00:04:27.910
<v Speaker 1>yourself and the major player in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>war,</v>

68
00:04:27.911 --> 00:04:29.860
<v Speaker 1>at least in principle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the ego.</v>

69
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:30.783
<v Speaker 1>And that would be equivalent to Freud's </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious money that at least in the </v>

70
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:34.533
<v Speaker 1>initial phases of his theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's somewhat complicated to talk about </v>

71
00:04:37.211 --> 00:04:38.044
<v Speaker 1>Freud because of course it's theory </v>
<v Speaker 1>developed across time and in the </v>

72
00:04:41.021 --> 00:04:41.854
<v Speaker 1>beginning he basically broke the mind up</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the conscious mind and the </v>

73
00:04:44.591 --> 00:04:47.530
<v Speaker 1>unconscious mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can think of the conscious mind,</v>

74
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.903
<v Speaker 1>well that's you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Essentially that's the you that you can </v>

75
00:04:51.071 --> 00:04:51.904
<v Speaker 1>refer to during day to day experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the unconscious mind is a </v>

76
00:04:55.781 --> 00:04:56.614
<v Speaker 1>storehouse of two broad classes of </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomena and one would be drives that </v>

77
00:05:05.201 --> 00:05:06.034
<v Speaker 1>are grounded in instinct that are either</v>
<v Speaker 1>at odds with your current goal or </v>

78
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.120
<v Speaker 1>memories often traumatic that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't been able to integrate into your</v>

79
00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:20.410
<v Speaker 1>conscious framework.</v>

80
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:26.020
<v Speaker 1>And so those pesky things take on their </v>
<v Speaker 1>own life.</v>

81
00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.113
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

82
00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:29.493
<v Speaker 1>if you take an animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you take out increasingly large </v>

83
00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:32.643
<v Speaker 1>segments of its cortex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say the animal still organizes itself </v>

84
00:05:36.401 --> 00:05:39.730
<v Speaker 1>into that animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it starts to lose function,</v>

85
00:05:39.731 --> 00:05:40.564
<v Speaker 1>especially if you go deep into the brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can kill an animal if you go </v>

86
00:05:42.881 --> 00:05:46.150
<v Speaker 1>deep into the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you stay on the cortical surface,</v>

87
00:05:46.151 --> 00:05:46.984
<v Speaker 1>you can take an awful lot of brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>tissue out without interfering with a </v>

88
00:05:50.441 --> 00:05:52.750
<v Speaker 1>lot of the animal's ability to sustain </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

89
00:05:52.751 --> 00:05:56.560
<v Speaker 1>And what that shows is that the brain is</v>
<v Speaker 1>organized in such a way.</v>

90
00:05:56.561 --> 00:05:57.394
<v Speaker 1>So that isolated components of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll take on a function of the entire </v>

91
00:06:01.791 --> 00:06:06.030
<v Speaker 1>personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not demonstration in some sense that the</v>

92
00:06:06.031 --> 00:06:10.230
<v Speaker 1>sub elements of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the psyche or or perhaps subsystems,</v>

93
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.930
<v Speaker 1>subsystems of the brain can organize </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves into functional living units.</v>

94
00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.210
<v Speaker 1>And it stands to reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you lose an arm,</v>

95
00:06:17.211 --> 00:06:18.044
<v Speaker 1>you don't stop functioning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just reorganize your personality </v>

96
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:22.520
<v Speaker 1>minus the arm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you,</v>

97
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:23.773
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

98
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:24.673
<v Speaker 1>if you have only managed to integrate a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain subset of the potential psychic </v>

99
00:06:28.971 --> 00:06:29.804
<v Speaker 1>manifestations of your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that subset is going to formulate </v>

100
00:06:34.221 --> 00:06:35.054
<v Speaker 1>the main personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But all the other things that you're </v>

101
00:06:36.321 --> 00:06:37.154
<v Speaker 1>ignoring or can't integrate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to have a life of their </v>

102
00:06:38.661 --> 00:06:40.790
<v Speaker 1>own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't just disappear.</v>

103
00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:42.493
<v Speaker 1>And so Freud offers the unsettling idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're by no means master in your </v>

104
00:06:47.781 --> 00:06:48.614
<v Speaker 1>own house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the ways you can determine </v>

105
00:06:50.841 --> 00:06:54.020
<v Speaker 1>that is by watching yourself do things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you don't want to do.</v>

106
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.380
<v Speaker 1>And those are things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

107
00:06:57.381 --> 00:06:58.214
<v Speaker 1>that you'd have a hard time facing up to</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of course most of the things </v>

108
00:07:00.711 --> 00:07:01.544
<v Speaker 1>that you don't want to do are things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you might be ashamed of or anxious </v>

109
00:07:04.701 --> 00:07:05.030
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

110
00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:08.630
<v Speaker 1>And then of course there's the defeat </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you suffer when you,</v>

111
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.350
<v Speaker 1>when your ego is hypothetically and </v>
<v Speaker 1>control of the circumstance and you find</v>

112
00:07:12.351 --> 00:07:13.184
<v Speaker 1>your behavior or your thoughts directed </v>
<v Speaker 1>in some direction under the control of </v>

113
00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:20.960
<v Speaker 1>something that you think that you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>mastered.</v>

114
00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:23.960
<v Speaker 1>You can really see this in conditions </v>
<v Speaker 1>like anorexia.</v>

115
00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:27.140
<v Speaker 1>So especially if it's accompanied by </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bulemia,</v>

116
00:07:27.141 --> 00:07:29.810
<v Speaker 1>which it often is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anorexia is a,</v>

117
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:30.943
<v Speaker 1>an eating disorder that causes people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think essentially become extremely </v>

118
00:07:34.281 --> 00:07:35.114
<v Speaker 1>disgusted with their own physiology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with their own physical being and warps </v>

119
00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.210
<v Speaker 1>their perceptions terribly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

120
00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:42.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>

121
00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:43.253
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

122
00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:48.880
<v Speaker 1>an anorexic client at one point and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was a rather small woman,</v>

123
00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:51.530
<v Speaker 1>maybe five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two or something like that,</v>

124
00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:52.633
<v Speaker 1>quite thin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously she had anorexia and I asked </v>

125
00:07:55.461 --> 00:07:59.870
<v Speaker 1>her what she was in my office if her </v>
<v Speaker 1>thigh was bigger or smaller than mine.</v>

126
00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.190
<v Speaker 1>And she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

127
00:08:01.191 --> 00:08:02.690
<v Speaker 1>it was about the same size.</v>

128
00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:03.793
<v Speaker 1>So I took a piece of paper and I'm sat </v>
<v Speaker 1>on at 10 I drew the outline of my thigh </v>

129
00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:11.840
<v Speaker 1>on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I had her sit on the same piece</v>

130
00:08:11.841 --> 00:08:14.300
<v Speaker 1>of paper and she drew the outline of her</v>
<v Speaker 1>thigh.</v>

131
00:08:14.301 --> 00:08:17.840
<v Speaker 1>And of course there was probably that </v>
<v Speaker 1>much space on both sides between the two</v>

132
00:08:17.841 --> 00:08:18.674
<v Speaker 1>outlines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which probably looked at that for 15 </v>

133
00:08:20.241 --> 00:08:21.740
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

134
00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:22.633
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she could not believe that that could </v>

135
00:08:24.081 --> 00:08:24.914
<v Speaker 1>possibly be the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think what happens in our </v>

136
00:08:27.401 --> 00:08:31.160
<v Speaker 1>anorexics is that they stopped being </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to look at their whole bodies.</v>

137
00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:34.280
<v Speaker 1>So when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you look at yourself in the mirror,</v>

138
00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:38.090
<v Speaker 1>you kind of have to look in a gestalt </v>
<v Speaker 1>manner.</v>

139
00:08:38.091 --> 00:08:41.240
<v Speaker 1>You have to get a picture of the whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alternatively,</v>

140
00:08:41.241 --> 00:08:45.140
<v Speaker 1>you can focus on small parts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the more you focus on parts,</v>

141
00:08:45.141 --> 00:08:48.440
<v Speaker 1>the more difficult it is to see the </v>
<v Speaker 1>parts in relationship to the hole.</v>

142
00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:49.723
<v Speaker 1>And anorexics get unbelievably focused </v>
<v Speaker 1>on small elements and they confuse </v>

143
00:08:54.411 --> 00:08:55.590
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

144
00:08:55.591 --> 00:08:58.410
<v Speaker 1>if they're looking at their arms and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some flesh on it,</v>

145
00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:01.043
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are unable to make a distinction </v>

146
00:09:03.361 --> 00:09:06.030
<v Speaker 1>between the flesh and fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they want no fat,</v>

147
00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:10.980
<v Speaker 1>they want to go right down to the bone </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they can't because they're concerned</v>

148
00:09:10.981 --> 00:09:11.814
<v Speaker 1>about that tiny little part or maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>this tiny little park or wherever they </v>

149
00:09:14.851 --> 00:09:15.684
<v Speaker 1>happen to be focused there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get completely unable to perceive </v>

150
00:09:18.181 --> 00:09:22.470
<v Speaker 1>their own bodies and it's quite striking</v>
<v Speaker 1>how far that can go.</v>

151
00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:26.410
<v Speaker 1>And then the believe mick end of it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the,</v>

152
00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:30.300
<v Speaker 1>the person will starve themselves for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>long period of time.</v>

153
00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:31.613
<v Speaker 1>And of course we'll think about this and</v>
<v Speaker 1>modern physiological terms feeding </v>

154
00:09:35.911 --> 00:09:38.070
<v Speaker 1>behavior is regulated by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus.</v>

155
00:09:38.071 --> 00:09:38.904
<v Speaker 1>And that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an ancient brain area that the </v>

156
00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:41.403
<v Speaker 1>controls fundamental motivational </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems and it's right above the spinal </v>

157
00:09:44.521 --> 00:09:45.840
<v Speaker 1>cord and it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

158
00:09:45.841 --> 00:09:48.570
<v Speaker 1>very powerful center of Control in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>

159
00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:51.270
<v Speaker 1>It's functional enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I told you this before,</v>

160
00:09:51.271 --> 00:09:52.104
<v Speaker 1>that if you take a cat and you take off </v>
<v Speaker 1>its entire cortex and even most of its </v>

161
00:09:55.741 --> 00:09:56.574
<v Speaker 1>emotional systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you leave it just with the </v>

162
00:09:57.631 --> 00:09:58.464
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus and the spinal cord,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which basically means it has almost no </v>

163
00:10:00.661 --> 00:10:01.494
<v Speaker 1>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can organize its behavior almost </v>

164
00:10:03.331 --> 00:10:05.730
<v Speaker 1>perfectly as long as you keep it in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>simple environment.</v>

165
00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:10.260
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the anorexic attempts to starve.</v>

166
00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:12.053
<v Speaker 1>But so that's a conscious goal you might</v>
<v Speaker 1>say or or that might be an ego related </v>

167
00:10:17.191 --> 00:10:18.024
<v Speaker 1>goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or You could even think about it as a </v>

168
00:10:18.901 --> 00:10:19.734
<v Speaker 1>goal that's motivated by other </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious forces because maybe she </v>

169
00:10:22.891 --> 00:10:24.870
<v Speaker 1>doesn't know exactly why she wants to </v>
<v Speaker 1>start.</v>

170
00:10:24.871 --> 00:10:25.704
<v Speaker 1>But in any case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what generally happens is she'll run </v>

171
00:10:30.001 --> 00:10:34.050
<v Speaker 1>into an emotionally upsetting situation </v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

172
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:36.300
<v Speaker 1>emotional upset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>act,</v>

173
00:10:36.301 --> 00:10:37.134
<v Speaker 1>say it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes you anxious or it puts you in </v>

174
00:10:38.221 --> 00:10:42.510
<v Speaker 1>emotional pain that activates higher </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain centers then the hypothalamus,</v>

175
00:10:42.511 --> 00:10:43.650
<v Speaker 1>but they're still pretty low.</v>

176
00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:44.483
<v Speaker 1>There's still pretty primordial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that kind of </v>

177
00:10:46.831 --> 00:10:49.500
<v Speaker 1>emotional upset does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's call it stress,</v>

178
00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:53.550
<v Speaker 1>is shut off your longterm planning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is,</v>

179
00:10:53.551 --> 00:10:56.070
<v Speaker 1>is that if you're stressed in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

180
00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:57.180
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the immediate,</v>

181
00:10:57.181 --> 00:10:58.014
<v Speaker 1>now your body and brain presume that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>should devote divert resources from the </v>

182
00:11:02.941 --> 00:11:06.900
<v Speaker 1>hypothetical future to solving the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem that's right in front of you.</v>

183
00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:09.420
<v Speaker 1>And that's often a more behaviorally </v>
<v Speaker 1>oriented,</v>

184
00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:12.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>solution like freezing or withdrawing or</v>

185
00:11:12.451 --> 00:11:13.284
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it shuts off your prefrontal cortex </v>

186
00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:16.710
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as that happens,</v>

187
00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:19.500
<v Speaker 1>then the hypothalamus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is as I said,</v>

188
00:11:19.501 --> 00:11:24.360
<v Speaker 1>a very powerful system just reaches up </v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense and dominates the person.</v>

189
00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:27.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's been there for God only </v>
<v Speaker 1>knows how long,</v>

190
00:11:27.091 --> 00:11:27.924
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tens of millions of years and it's job </v>

191
00:11:30.061 --> 00:11:33.270
<v Speaker 1>is to stop you from starving to death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

192
00:11:33.271 --> 00:11:36.150
<v Speaker 1>you could imagine that over the course </v>
<v Speaker 1>of evolutionary history,</v>

193
00:11:36.151 --> 00:11:41.070
<v Speaker 1>anybody who had a relatively weak </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeding instinct died.</v>

194
00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:42.323
<v Speaker 1>And so they were at our ancestors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens to the Baleen is </v>

195
00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:50.850
<v Speaker 1>something will upset them and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll get an uncontrollable desire for</v>

196
00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:54.220
<v Speaker 1>often something that's high calorie and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sweet and full of fat,</v>

197
00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:55.083
<v Speaker 1>logically enough because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>starving and then they'll eat like a </v>

198
00:11:56.981 --> 00:11:59.140
<v Speaker 1>whole quart of ice cream in two loaves </v>
<v Speaker 1>of bread.</v>

199
00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:01.660
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they described the state that they're in</v>

200
00:12:01.661 --> 00:12:04.510
<v Speaker 1>while they're doing that as dissociated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

201
00:12:04.511 --> 00:12:07.180
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't feel like them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

202
00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:08.103
<v Speaker 1>you can imagine why in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean partly is the whole realm of </v>

203
00:12:11.561 --> 00:12:15.130
<v Speaker 1>eating behavior and it eating is as some</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>

204
00:12:15.131 --> 00:12:17.140
<v Speaker 1>It's not just a behavior and it's not a </v>
<v Speaker 1>drive.</v>

205
00:12:17.141 --> 00:12:19.810
<v Speaker 1>Like when you think about when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>hungry,</v>

206
00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:25.410
<v Speaker 1>it's not like your brain is moving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You literally step by determined step.</v>

207
00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:27.453
<v Speaker 1>It's that you start fantasizing about </v>
<v Speaker 1>food and you start thinking about what </v>

208
00:12:30.071 --> 00:12:30.940
<v Speaker 1>you may be wanting.</v>

209
00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:31.773
<v Speaker 1>Then you start to make plans about where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to go or how you're going </v>

210
00:12:34.241 --> 00:12:36.340
<v Speaker 1>to cook it and what social,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

211
00:12:36.341 --> 00:12:39.550
<v Speaker 1>what social surroundings going to be in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a whole bunch of things.</v>

212
00:12:39.551 --> 00:12:43.050
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the hungry you well in an,</v>

213
00:12:43.051 --> 00:12:43.884
<v Speaker 1>in an anorexic or Bulimic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hungry part of the person is so </v>

214
00:12:47.891 --> 00:12:50.830
<v Speaker 1>dissociated from the part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ego part,</v>

215
00:12:50.831 --> 00:12:51.664
<v Speaker 1>but they're basically in a war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But one of the problems with being in a </v>

216
00:12:54.461 --> 00:12:57.910
<v Speaker 1>war with your hypothalamus is that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost always wins and it's a good thing</v>

217
00:12:57.911 --> 00:12:59.920
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise you die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

218
00:12:59.921 --> 00:13:02.920
<v Speaker 1>and lots of anorexic stu manage to </v>
<v Speaker 1>starve themselves to death.</v>

219
00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:08.520
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a good example of just </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly how dissociable the mind can be.</v>

220
00:13:08.561 --> 00:13:09.394
<v Speaker 1>And the mind is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is also the brain is dissociable in the </v>

221
00:13:12.341 --> 00:13:15.550
<v Speaker 1>strangest possible ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's an example.</v>

222
00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:18.550
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember the name of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>syndrome,</v>

223
00:13:18.551 --> 00:13:19.780
<v Speaker 1>it might pop into my mind.</v>

224
00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:23.470
<v Speaker 1>But so you can have a particular kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>stroke.</v>

225
00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:24.633
<v Speaker 1>And here's the effect of the stroke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You develop the fixed delusion that a </v>

226
00:13:30.371 --> 00:13:33.490
<v Speaker 1>person who's very close to you capgras </v>
<v Speaker 1>syndrome,</v>

227
00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.940
<v Speaker 1>a person who's very close to you has </v>
<v Speaker 1>been,</v>

228
00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:37.803
<v Speaker 1>has died or being kidnapped or somehow </v>
<v Speaker 1>disappeared and has been replaced by </v>

229
00:13:41.561 --> 00:13:46.561
<v Speaker 1>their exact double.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so and so it's obviously something,</v>

230
00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:51.040
<v Speaker 1>it manifests itself as something akin to</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychosis.</v>

231
00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:52.353
<v Speaker 1>And what happens is that the stroke </v>
<v Speaker 1>damages the relationship between the </v>

232
00:13:57.250 --> 00:14:02.200
<v Speaker 1>generally the visual systems that </v>
<v Speaker 1>identify faces and the emotional systems</v>

233
00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:05.880
<v Speaker 1>that tag that identified face with </v>
<v Speaker 1>familiar emotions.</v>

234
00:14:05.881 --> 00:14:06.714
<v Speaker 1>So basically what happens is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say it happens to you and it's </v>

235
00:14:08.861 --> 00:14:10.780
<v Speaker 1>your mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at your mother,</v>

236
00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.670
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't your mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

237
00:14:12.671 --> 00:14:16.720
<v Speaker 1>your mother comes with a whole complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>of memories and you know,</v>

238
00:14:16.721 --> 00:14:20.920
<v Speaker 1>she's sat in there in a very broad </v>
<v Speaker 1>context of memory and emotion.</v>

239
00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:23.770
<v Speaker 1>And then you look at this person and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>looks like your mother,</v>

240
00:14:23.771 --> 00:14:24.604
<v Speaker 1>but none of that is happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then you develop this idea as </v>

241
00:14:27.431 --> 00:14:28.600
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's not my mother,</v>

242
00:14:28.601 --> 00:14:29.434
<v Speaker 1>it looks exactly like my mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then what could possibly be going </v>

243
00:14:31.631 --> 00:14:32.464
<v Speaker 1>on in the answer as well?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously she's being taken away and </v>

244
00:14:36.371 --> 00:14:37.204
<v Speaker 1>replaced by her exact duplicate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People get into real trouble with this </v>

245
00:14:39.731 --> 00:14:43.510
<v Speaker 1>sort of delusion as you might imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they get obsessed with trying to</v>

246
00:14:43.511 --> 00:14:46.210
<v Speaker 1>solve the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what did you do with my mother?</v>

247
00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:48.340
<v Speaker 1>And you can understand why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here's the,</v>

248
00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:50.470
<v Speaker 1>here's a weirder thing even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that it's,</v>

249
00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:55.960
<v Speaker 1>it's modality specific so that if they </v>
<v Speaker 1>listened to their mother on the phone,</v>

250
00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:59.390
<v Speaker 1>that's their mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

251
00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:02.360
<v Speaker 1>so you see exactly how dissociable the </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain is.</v>

252
00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:05.030
<v Speaker 1>The mind is even down to small,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

253
00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:08.630
<v Speaker 1>sub function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there are people with strokes who can</v>

254
00:15:08.631 --> 00:15:10.310
<v Speaker 1>sing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but who can't talk.</v>

255
00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:14.000
<v Speaker 1>And there are people who lose nouns and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are people who lose only versed.</v>

256
00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:15.860
<v Speaker 1>And there are people who can identify </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

257
00:15:15.861 --> 00:15:16.694
<v Speaker 1>but they can't name them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea that the brain is a </v>

258
00:15:20.451 --> 00:15:25.451
<v Speaker 1>dissociable entity is obviously correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here's another example of it.</v>

259
00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:29.510
<v Speaker 1>While you dissociate all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

260
00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:32.900
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the way the brain is </v>
<v Speaker 1>structured,</v>

261
00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:36.890
<v Speaker 1>so there's a strip right about here </v>
<v Speaker 1>called the motor strip.</v>

262
00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:37.963
<v Speaker 1>And if you are doing brain surgery and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you touch someone with an electrode on </v>

263
00:15:41.121 --> 00:15:41.954
<v Speaker 1>that strip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll move the corresponding part of </v>

264
00:15:43.401 --> 00:15:46.430
<v Speaker 1>the body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the hands are very,</v>

265
00:15:46.431 --> 00:15:47.264
<v Speaker 1>very overrepresented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so is the face and the lips and the </v>

266
00:15:49.911 --> 00:15:53.720
<v Speaker 1>tongue for obvious reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We fiddle around with the world a lot.</v>

267
00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:57.170
<v Speaker 1>We move our arms and our hands a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The feed are overrepresented too.</v>

268
00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:01.460
<v Speaker 1>And then we communicate about that with </v>
<v Speaker 1>our face and our count.</v>

269
00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:04.380
<v Speaker 1>So there's huge representation there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

270
00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:06.770
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you touch that,</v>

271
00:16:06.771 --> 00:16:10.130
<v Speaker 1>you'll get a mo emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least the person who will will,</v>

272
00:16:10.131 --> 00:16:10.964
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>describe a strong impulse to move well </v>

273
00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:17.660
<v Speaker 1>out of that grew the prefrontal cortex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the best way to think of what people</v>

274
00:16:17.661 --> 00:16:22.340
<v Speaker 1>think about that as the substrate of </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstract thought.</v>

275
00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:23.293
<v Speaker 1>It's not really a good way of thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it because you're not really out </v>

276
00:16:26.661 --> 00:16:27.494
<v Speaker 1>to think you're out to act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason you think is so that you </v>

277
00:16:31.311 --> 00:16:34.670
<v Speaker 1>can try out some actions in a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

278
00:16:34.671 --> 00:16:37.670
<v Speaker 1>And found a seat before you implement </v>
<v Speaker 1>them in your behavior.</v>

279
00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:39.610
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to think things,</v>

280
00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:40.453
<v Speaker 1>things through means to conjure up an </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstracted world and then to conjure up </v>

281
00:16:44.301 --> 00:16:49.301
<v Speaker 1>a representation of yourself acting in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that world to calculate the consequences</v>

282
00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:52.040
<v Speaker 1>and then to decide whether you're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to implement it.</v>

283
00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:52.903
<v Speaker 1>Well that's another form of dissociative</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability because you can think without </v>

284
00:16:56.181 --> 00:16:57.014
<v Speaker 1>acting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you know it certainly that part of </v>

285
00:16:59.691 --> 00:17:00.524
<v Speaker 1>you that's able to corner up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>alternative worlds that human beings </v>

286
00:17:02.961 --> 00:17:05.330
<v Speaker 1>seem to particularly identify with.</v>

287
00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:06.193
<v Speaker 1>You know that part that's thinking at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least modern people really think of the </v>

288
00:17:09.261 --> 00:17:10.094
<v Speaker 1>part that's thinking as them or the part</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's capable of conjuring up abstract </v>

289
00:17:13.521 --> 00:17:14.354
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if it wasn't dissociable you just </v>

290
00:17:16.071 --> 00:17:19.010
<v Speaker 1>act out everything you thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that wouldn't work very well.</v>

291
00:17:19.011 --> 00:17:21.380
<v Speaker 1>So the brain is actually designed in </v>
<v Speaker 1>many ways,</v>

292
00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:24.800
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be dissociable now.</v>

293
00:17:24.801 --> 00:17:28.730
<v Speaker 1>So if you understand that and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand the two,</v>

294
00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:34.260
<v Speaker 1>the two l of the two sets of phenomena </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are likely to be dissociated,</v>

295
00:17:35.961 --> 00:17:36.794
<v Speaker 1>then you kind of got the essence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Freudian theory and the things that are </v>

296
00:17:39.321 --> 00:17:44.000
<v Speaker 1>likely to be dissociated are one </v>
<v Speaker 1>memories that were traumatic.</v>

297
00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:45.770
<v Speaker 1>And I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll talk about that in a minute.</v>

298
00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:49.040
<v Speaker 1>And two impulses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not,</v>

299
00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:51.720
<v Speaker 1>they're not even drives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was the Freud,</v>

300
00:17:51.721 --> 00:17:55.210
<v Speaker 1>you'd way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're subpersonalities troublesome sub</v>

301
00:17:55.211 --> 00:17:56.044
<v Speaker 1>personalities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can imagine that those would be </v>

302
00:17:58.621 --> 00:18:01.560
<v Speaker 1>linked to complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive and negative emotions.</v>

303
00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:03.990
<v Speaker 1>One might be resentment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guilt,</v>

304
00:18:03.991 --> 00:18:05.430
<v Speaker 1>shame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anger,</v>

305
00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:08.460
<v Speaker 1>anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jealousy,</v>

306
00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:10.200
<v Speaker 1>rage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lust.</v>

307
00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:11.063
<v Speaker 1>All of those emotions are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are difficult to integrate into a </v>

308
00:18:14.581 --> 00:18:15.414
<v Speaker 1>personality property.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Partly because in their pure </v>

309
00:18:17.821 --> 00:18:21.100
<v Speaker 1>manifestation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not there.</v>

310
00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:24.210
<v Speaker 1>They disrupt the social order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

311
00:18:24.211 --> 00:18:25.044
<v Speaker 1>so like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about how well regulated all of </v>

312
00:18:27.121 --> 00:18:29.040
<v Speaker 1>you are sitting here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

313
00:18:29.041 --> 00:18:29.810
<v Speaker 1>and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

314
00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:30.643
<v Speaker 1>you're 6 million years since you </v>
<v Speaker 1>dissociated or since you've diverged </v>

315
00:18:34.351 --> 00:18:35.184
<v Speaker 1>from chimpanzees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we took a bunch of chimpanzees that </v>

316
00:18:37.591 --> 00:18:39.690
<v Speaker 1>knew each other as well as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other,</v>

317
00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:42.540
<v Speaker 1>this place would be an absolute brutal </v>
<v Speaker 1>massacre.</v>

318
00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:45.150
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

319
00:18:45.151 --> 00:18:45.984
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can control your primordial </v>

320
00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:52.350
<v Speaker 1>instincts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of looking at it.</v>

321
00:18:52.351 --> 00:18:54.930
<v Speaker 1>That's how Freud would look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've learned to control them.</v>

322
00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:56.453
<v Speaker 1>And Freud's theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is where it differs from the </v>

323
00:18:59.461 --> 00:19:02.340
<v Speaker 1>theories that we talked about earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say with regards to piaget,</v>

324
00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:05.250
<v Speaker 1>Freud's theory is really more about </v>
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>

325
00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:10.460
<v Speaker 1>He thought of all of these potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>subsystems and memories conflicting with</v>

326
00:19:12.571 --> 00:19:14.820
<v Speaker 1>each other like a war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a Hob.</v>

327
00:19:14.821 --> 00:19:15.654
<v Speaker 1>See in war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So hobbes was the philosopher who said </v>

328
00:19:17.701 --> 00:19:21.000
<v Speaker 1>that life is nasty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brutal and short.</v>

329
00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:24.660
<v Speaker 1>And that in the state of nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone is at war with everyone else.</v>

330
00:19:24.661 --> 00:19:26.670
<v Speaker 1>And so you need a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

331
00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:30.240
<v Speaker 1>a Leviathan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a talk down control system,</v>

332
00:19:30.241 --> 00:19:34.800
<v Speaker 1>a Leviathan who will punish any deviance</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the social contract.</v>

333
00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:36.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the Freudian Super Ego.</v>

334
00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:39.540
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud thought of the unconscious and the</v>

335
00:19:39.541 --> 00:19:44.010
<v Speaker 1>conscious mind to begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but later he dissociated that up into in</v>

336
00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:45.023
<v Speaker 1>ego and superego.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he thought that each of those </v>

337
00:19:47.431 --> 00:19:50.490
<v Speaker 1>had their unconscious elements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

338
00:19:50.491 --> 00:19:51.324
<v Speaker 1>so you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're under the grip of an ID </v>

339
00:19:54.151 --> 00:19:58.470
<v Speaker 1>related subpersonality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say you can be conscious of that,</v>

340
00:19:58.471 --> 00:19:59.304
<v Speaker 1>but there's the possibility for all </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of other interrelated </v>

341
00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:03.090
<v Speaker 1>subpersonalities to emerge.</v>

342
00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:07.590
<v Speaker 1>So those would be in your unconscious </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's also possible and highly likely</v>

343
00:20:07.591 --> 00:20:08.424
<v Speaker 1>in fact that the way that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>perceiving the world and the way you're </v>

344
00:20:10.981 --> 00:20:11.814
<v Speaker 1>acting in it and even what you state as </v>
<v Speaker 1>your goals are influenced in ways that </v>

345
00:20:16.051 --> 00:20:19.670
<v Speaker 1>you don't understand by the action of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these unconscious systems.</v>

346
00:20:19.671 --> 00:20:21.450
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

347
00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:24.480
<v Speaker 1>maybe some of you are headed for medical</v>
<v Speaker 1>school and if I asked you why,</v>

348
00:20:24.481 --> 00:20:28.080
<v Speaker 1>he'll give me six humanitarian reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the actual reason is,</v>

349
00:20:28.081 --> 00:20:28.914
<v Speaker 1>is because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your grandmother would be disappointed </v>

350
00:20:31.381 --> 00:20:34.590
<v Speaker 1>if you weren't and she might not even be</v>
<v Speaker 1>alive anymore.</v>

351
00:20:34.591 --> 00:20:35.700
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she may have,</v>

352
00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:40.350
<v Speaker 1>your mother may have imitated your </v>
<v Speaker 1>grandmother so that that ideal is firmly</v>

353
00:20:40.351 --> 00:20:41.184
<v Speaker 1>embodied in her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that set up the unspoken </v>

354
00:20:43.951 --> 00:20:47.130
<v Speaker 1>expectations about your behavior ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>since you were a tiny child.</v>

355
00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:52.060
<v Speaker 1>So that's an interesting sub element of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of psychodynamic theory too.</v>

356
00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:55.120
<v Speaker 1>And it's really something to watch for </v>
<v Speaker 1>in your personal relationships.</v>

357
00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:56.463
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very frequently if you watch carefully </v>

358
00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:01.330
<v Speaker 1>that you can see someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially someone you love,</v>

359
00:21:01.331 --> 00:21:02.164
<v Speaker 1>cause you have to know them well being </v>
<v Speaker 1>taken over in some sense by the spirit </v>

360
00:21:06.821 --> 00:21:08.630
<v Speaker 1>of one of their ancestors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

361
00:21:08.631 --> 00:21:13.631
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean this in a metaphysical way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that the,</v>

362
00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:16.150
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thought,</v>

363
00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:20.680
<v Speaker 1>the personality of the grandmother or </v>
<v Speaker 1>the personality of the mother has a,</v>

364
00:21:20.681 --> 00:21:23.380
<v Speaker 1>has a structure that's well known to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

365
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:24.663
<v Speaker 1>to the individual in question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that individual spent a lot of time </v>

366
00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:28.143
<v Speaker 1>imitating them in all sorts of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those imitated structures can be </v>

367
00:21:31.751 --> 00:21:34.450
<v Speaker 1>passed down generation to generation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

368
00:21:34.451 --> 00:21:35.284
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's partly what constitutes your </v>

369
00:21:37.031 --> 00:21:38.140
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

370
00:21:38.141 --> 00:21:38.974
<v Speaker 1>It's the imitated personality of all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your ancestors that constitutes your </v>

371
00:21:42.671 --> 00:21:44.980
<v Speaker 1>culture and those things can possess </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

372
00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:45.903
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he ologies possess you and exact not </v>

373
00:21:47.681 --> 00:21:50.080
<v Speaker 1>exactly the same way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in a very similar way.</v>

374
00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:53.140
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

375
00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:55.990
<v Speaker 1>so you've got the end and you've got the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ego and the superego.</v>

376
00:21:55.991 --> 00:21:59.710
<v Speaker 1>And as in the Harpsi and worldview,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's real tension between them.</v>

377
00:21:59.711 --> 00:22:00.544
<v Speaker 1>So that the end is always trying to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>its base gratifications it's based </v>

378
00:22:05.291 --> 00:22:10.291
<v Speaker 1>desires ratified now in the in Friday </v>
<v Speaker 1>and times that was mostly problematic in</v>

379
00:22:11.921 --> 00:22:15.910
<v Speaker 1>relationship to sex and the reasons for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are quite clear.</v>

380
00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:17.463
<v Speaker 1>There was no valid birth control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was very little employment option </v>

381
00:22:23.651 --> 00:22:24.484
<v Speaker 1>for women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's sexual behavior had to be </v>

382
00:22:26.261 --> 00:22:26.891
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

383
00:22:26.891 --> 00:22:27.724
<v Speaker 1>very tightly regulated or they'd fall </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of the social structure into </v>

384
00:22:30.371 --> 00:22:34.060
<v Speaker 1>prostitution or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there was that,</v>

385
00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:38.350
<v Speaker 1>the threat of various venereal diseases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most particularly syphilis,</v>

386
00:22:38.351 --> 00:22:40.960
<v Speaker 1>which is as awful a disease as you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine it,</v>

387
00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:42.123
<v Speaker 1>it can imitate or mimic all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>other diseases and it's transmissible </v>

388
00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:49.540
<v Speaker 1>from mother to child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a nasty one.</v>

389
00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:53.260
<v Speaker 1>So sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was very difficult for the victorians</v>

390
00:22:53.261 --> 00:22:56.410
<v Speaker 1>to integrate sexuality because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

391
00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:58.120
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did you do that there?</v>

392
00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:02.110
<v Speaker 1>The the one pathway to potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>integration.</v>

393
00:23:02.111 --> 00:23:06.010
<v Speaker 1>Something the Super Ego say would </v>
<v Speaker 1>approve of was a miracle pathway.</v>

394
00:23:06.011 --> 00:23:08.470
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people back then that,</v>

395
00:23:08.471 --> 00:23:10.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the 1960s people were getting married</v>

396
00:23:10.991 --> 00:23:14.550
<v Speaker 1>around 19 or 20 but that's actually a </v>
<v Speaker 1>historical anomaly.</v>

397
00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:18.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean typically speaking in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Victorian age,</v>

398
00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:19.023
<v Speaker 1>a man usually couldn't afford to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>married til he was in his mid to late </v>

399
00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:22.743
<v Speaker 1>twenties he just didn't have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>resources and women who were married </v>

400
00:23:24.431 --> 00:23:25.264
<v Speaker 1>usually younger than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so there was a long period of time </v>

401
00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:29.393
<v Speaker 1>for men particularly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also for women where the sexual </v>

402
00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:36.220
<v Speaker 1>drive from a Friday and perspective was </v>
<v Speaker 1>in full,</v>

403
00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:40.180
<v Speaker 1>was fully flourishing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fully manifesting itself.</v>

404
00:23:40.181 --> 00:23:43.810
<v Speaker 1>But there was no socially approved mode </v>
<v Speaker 1>of expression.</v>

405
00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:45.183
<v Speaker 1>And so under conditions there's a war </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the ID and the superego in a </v>

406
00:23:48.901 --> 00:23:49.250
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

407
00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:51.230
<v Speaker 1>And the Portland Ego was crushed in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle.</v>

408
00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:54.800
<v Speaker 1>Now you could certainly see that when we</v>
<v Speaker 1>were watching the movie,</v>

409
00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:55.663
<v Speaker 1>the crumb brothers movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they are basically in the same </v>

410
00:23:57.261 --> 00:23:58.190
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

411
00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:59.263
<v Speaker 1>There was no socially approved way that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they could manifest any sexual or any </v>

412
00:24:03.141 --> 00:24:03.974
<v Speaker 1>aggressive behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what happened as a consequence was </v>

413
00:24:05.931 --> 00:24:09.880
<v Speaker 1>that the both of those fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>subpersonalities,</v>

414
00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:10.723
<v Speaker 1>let's call them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>become incredibly pathologized as </v>

415
00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:18.170
<v Speaker 1>particularly characterized by resentment</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the desire for revenge.</v>

416
00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:21.110
<v Speaker 1>Because remember these systems think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

417
00:24:21.290 --> 00:24:24.740
<v Speaker 1>if someone's excrutiatingly sexually </v>
<v Speaker 1>frustrated,</v>

418
00:24:24.741 --> 00:24:25.574
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and let's think about it in the broader </v>

419
00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:30.170
<v Speaker 1>scheme of things because sexuality isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

420
00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:34.550
<v Speaker 1>it's not a narrow unit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensional drive it,</v>

421
00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:35.913
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's associated with playfulness and </v>

422
00:24:37.251 --> 00:24:38.084
<v Speaker 1>it's associated with the desire for </v>
<v Speaker 1>social contact and the desire for </v>

423
00:24:40.671 --> 00:24:42.530
<v Speaker 1>communication and the desire for </v>
<v Speaker 1>touching.</v>

424
00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:45.910
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a complicated multi branching </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomena.</v>

425
00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:47.180
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

426
00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:49.820
<v Speaker 1>in the case of the people who we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching in the movie,</v>

427
00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:53.840
<v Speaker 1>none of that was either integrated into </v>
<v Speaker 1>their personalities,</v>

428
00:24:53.841 --> 00:24:56.990
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or permitted by society.</v>

429
00:24:56.990 --> 00:24:58.140
<v Speaker 1>And so it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

430
00:24:58.400 --> 00:24:59.233
<v Speaker 1>it was bent and warped and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and frustrated and then generated all </v>

431
00:25:02.421 --> 00:25:06.650
<v Speaker 1>sorts of ideas about resentment and </v>
<v Speaker 1>revenge around it.</v>

432
00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:07.813
<v Speaker 1>So you can develop an incredibly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an incredibly pathological </v>

433
00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:16.610
<v Speaker 1>subpersonality in the one cartoon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you remember when it was the one that</v>

434
00:25:16.701 --> 00:25:21.701
<v Speaker 1>was most disturbing where Mr Natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>brought Robert that headless woman.</v>

435
00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:27.050
<v Speaker 1>So he wanted pure gratification without </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility.</v>

436
00:25:27.051 --> 00:25:27.884
<v Speaker 1>So it's a really it driven phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he had intercourse with her and </v>

437
00:25:31.641 --> 00:25:34.670
<v Speaker 1>immediately after that was unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 1>guilty.</v>

438
00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:37.880
<v Speaker 1>You know when you can see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you think about what that must mean.</v>

439
00:25:37.881 --> 00:25:41.340
<v Speaker 1>It's like someone is under the grip of </v>
<v Speaker 1>one subpersonalities.</v>

440
00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:42.573
<v Speaker 1>It's shaping all of their thoughts and </v>
<v Speaker 1>their memories and their emotions and </v>

441
00:25:44.961 --> 00:25:47.780
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden that becomes gratified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's satiated,</v>

442
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:51.410
<v Speaker 1>it disappears in Bang up comes the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>one and it's,</v>

443
00:25:51.411 --> 00:25:52.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wealth.</v>

444
00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:55.580
<v Speaker 1>In this particular example it was guilt </v>
<v Speaker 1>and shame and anxiety,</v>

445
00:25:55.670 --> 00:25:58.620
<v Speaker 1>terror even and self loathing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of those things.</v>

446
00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:03.470
<v Speaker 1>And if you read about the experiences of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who commit particularly atrocious</v>

447
00:26:03.471 --> 00:26:04.880
<v Speaker 1>crimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>

448
00:26:04.881 --> 00:26:05.714
<v Speaker 1>very common for them to experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly that there are driven by sexual </v>

449
00:26:09.951 --> 00:26:14.410
<v Speaker 1>slash aggressive impulses because those </v>
<v Speaker 1>are generally the ones that culminate in</v>

450
00:26:14.411 --> 00:26:16.610
<v Speaker 1>a particularly atrocious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

451
00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:17.533
<v Speaker 1>individual crimes and they'll commit </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and then the instantly flip back </v>

452
00:26:20.991 --> 00:26:21.824
<v Speaker 1>into their normative personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Except they're absolutely terrified by </v>

453
00:26:24.381 --> 00:26:25.880
<v Speaker 1>what they did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

454
00:26:25.881 --> 00:26:30.881
<v Speaker 1>it's more than one person is inhabiting </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same psyche and it's very,</v>

455
00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:34.310
<v Speaker 1>now they're tied together by memory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking.</v>

456
00:26:34.311 --> 00:26:37.820
<v Speaker 1>Although Freud would say you can also </v>
<v Speaker 1>dissociate memory.</v>

457
00:26:37.821 --> 00:26:38.654
<v Speaker 1>And so Freud talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about memories being repressed </v>

458
00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:44.820
<v Speaker 1>and that's caused an awful lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>trouble because,</v>

459
00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:48.750
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a whole variety of reasons because</v>

460
00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:56.410
<v Speaker 1>because memory is not cat memory is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>the object of recording.</v>

461
00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:04.760
<v Speaker 1>It's not the objective unbiased </v>
<v Speaker 1>recording of actually occurring events.</v>

462
00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:07.373
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you cannot actually objective </v>

463
00:27:08.861 --> 00:27:10.590
<v Speaker 1>where you record certain kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>events.</v>

464
00:27:10.591 --> 00:27:11.424
<v Speaker 1>Like we've talked about this before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't really objective where you </v>

465
00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:14.603
<v Speaker 1>record a discussion between a man and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman who'd been married for 20 years </v>

466
00:27:18.301 --> 00:27:20.970
<v Speaker 1>about anything important because for </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

467
00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:22.283
<v Speaker 1>each word and each phrase and each </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentence and each facial expression has </v>

468
00:27:26.191 --> 00:27:30.990
<v Speaker 1>to be interpreted within the context of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the entire relationship in order for the</v>

469
00:27:30.991 --> 00:27:33.300
<v Speaker 1>meaning of the utterances to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>extracted.</v>

470
00:27:33.301 --> 00:27:35.690
<v Speaker 1>And there's just no way you can record </v>
<v Speaker 1>that in a video.</v>

471
00:27:35.691 --> 00:27:36.524
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to have video the entire </v>

472
00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:40.860
<v Speaker 1>relationship and so you're not going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do that.</v>

473
00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:43.620
<v Speaker 1>And so memory is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very peculiar thing.</v>

474
00:27:43.621 --> 00:27:44.454
<v Speaker 1>And the idea that you could have an </v>
<v Speaker 1>objective record is not a very </v>

475
00:27:46.891 --> 00:27:49.890
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

476
00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:53.860
<v Speaker 1>Freud's idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense he had a rail,</v>

477
00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:54.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhat,</v>

478
00:27:56.730 --> 00:28:01.730
<v Speaker 1>I hate to say it was an insufficiently </v>
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated notion of what memory was.</v>

479
00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:06.240
<v Speaker 1>Now I hate to say that because Freud was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very sophisticated person,</v>

480
00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:07.553
<v Speaker 1>but he did in some sense believe in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence of an objective interpersonal </v>

481
00:28:11.491 --> 00:28:12.324
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he thought if something terrible </v>

482
00:28:13.831 --> 00:28:18.030
<v Speaker 1>happened to you when you were a child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you had a record of the memory,</v>

483
00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:21.090
<v Speaker 1>it was there as the mammary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the event,</v>

484
00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:26.870
<v Speaker 1>and then you needed something that would</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a sensor that would repress that.</v>

485
00:28:27.331 --> 00:28:30.000
<v Speaker 1>And then you needed a place for it to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>repressed into,</v>

486
00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:32.430
<v Speaker 1>which would be the unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you,</v>

487
00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:36.330
<v Speaker 1>but if you take apart a traumatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>memory,</v>

488
00:28:36.331 --> 00:28:40.050
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking with someone and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then he also,</v>

489
00:28:40.051 --> 00:28:40.884
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He also thought that that repressed </v>

490
00:28:42.091 --> 00:28:47.091
<v Speaker 1>memory might be represented in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a symptom,</v>

491
00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:52.390
<v Speaker 1>a symbolic symptom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think,</v>

492
00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:54.280
<v Speaker 1>I think that the repression theory,</v>

493
00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:55.790
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

494
00:28:55.790 --> 00:28:58.790
<v Speaker 1>Suffers from the inadequacy of its </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation of memory.</v>

495
00:28:58.791 --> 00:29:00.680
<v Speaker 1>Because here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a different way of thinking about</v>

496
00:29:00.681 --> 00:29:03.460
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more in keeping with the layer more</v>

497
00:29:03.461 --> 00:29:06.920
<v Speaker 1>than the hierarchical layer model that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we've been entertaining as we progress.</v>

498
00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:12.310
<v Speaker 1>So imagine that you were molested by </v>
<v Speaker 1>your uncle because it's usually a family</v>

499
00:29:14.031 --> 00:29:16.880
<v Speaker 1>member when you're for sexually </v>
<v Speaker 1>molested.</v>

500
00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:19.790
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first thing you have to ask yourself</v>

501
00:29:19.791 --> 00:29:22.790
<v Speaker 1>is just exactly what kind of memory do </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have.</v>

502
00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:25.220
<v Speaker 1>Imagine you're completely sexually </v>
<v Speaker 1>naive,</v>

503
00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:30.170
<v Speaker 1>which basically means you know nothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the sexual act and and it's,</v>

504
00:29:30.171 --> 00:29:33.230
<v Speaker 1>and it's implications or the mechanics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this happens to you.</v>

505
00:29:33.231 --> 00:29:36.680
<v Speaker 1>So the first question is how do you </v>
<v Speaker 1>represent that?</v>

506
00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:39.590
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is because to rip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to remember something,</v>

507
00:29:39.591 --> 00:29:41.950
<v Speaker 1>you have to represent it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>

508
00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:44.680
<v Speaker 1>Cause you don't just have a memory of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that event.</v>

509
00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:48.550
<v Speaker 1>It's always interpretation because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so many things going on.</v>

510
00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:50.830
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so maybe you,</v>

511
00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:53.950
<v Speaker 1>maybe your representation is pain and </v>
<v Speaker 1>confusion,</v>

512
00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:55.053
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there'd be another layer over </v>

513
00:29:57.971 --> 00:30:02.650
<v Speaker 1>that which would be the necessity for </v>
<v Speaker 1>secrecy because of course the person who</v>

514
00:30:02.651 --> 00:30:05.950
<v Speaker 1>does the molesting is going to tell you </v>
<v Speaker 1>what one of two things.</v>

515
00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:08.140
<v Speaker 1>It's three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's good for you.</v>

516
00:30:08.141 --> 00:30:10.140
<v Speaker 1>You asked for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

517
00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:13.780
<v Speaker 1>don't tell anyone or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or they'll think you're a bad person.</v>

518
00:30:13.781 --> 00:30:16.150
<v Speaker 1>This will be our little secret.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>

519
00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:21.270
<v Speaker 1>So then there's that whole overlay of </v>
<v Speaker 1>secrecy and inadmissibility.</v>

520
00:30:22.451 --> 00:30:23.830
<v Speaker 1>And what are you supposed to do about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

521
00:30:23.831 --> 00:30:24.664
<v Speaker 1>When you're for how you're supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand that something has just </v>

522
00:30:27.521 --> 00:30:29.590
<v Speaker 1>transpired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're not allowed to share it with</v>

523
00:30:29.591 --> 00:30:30.424
<v Speaker 1>anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have a model of the world </v>

524
00:30:32.111 --> 00:30:34.390
<v Speaker 1>that's sophisticated enough to account </v>
<v Speaker 1>for all that.</v>

525
00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:35.613
<v Speaker 1>And so then</v>

526
00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:40.810
<v Speaker 1>perhaps from then on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you do is avoid thinking about it.</v>

527
00:30:41.050 --> 00:30:42.880
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not the same as repression.</v>

528
00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:43.923
<v Speaker 1>Avoiding thinking about something is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same as repression because it </v>

529
00:30:46.961 --> 00:30:49.840
<v Speaker 1>doesn't require an active repressor in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order to do it.</v>

530
00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:51.820
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

531
00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:56.920
<v Speaker 1>years later you start to recall what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

532
00:30:56.921 --> 00:30:57.754
<v Speaker 1>But what you recall is an unclear mess </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the read and maybe most of it </v>

533
00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:04.271
<v Speaker 1>because you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

534
00:31:04.271 --> 00:31:05.104
<v Speaker 1>how are things represented as memories </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you can't develop a sophisticated </v>

535
00:31:09.311 --> 00:31:11.290
<v Speaker 1>representation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what seems to happen,</v>

536
00:31:11.291 --> 00:31:12.124
<v Speaker 1>and this is in a sense the reason </v>
<v Speaker 1>reversive Freud and theory is that </v>

537
00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:15.790
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

538
00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:17.470
<v Speaker 2>The the</v>

539
00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:19.463
<v Speaker 1>and is represented in the body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you can think about the </v>

540
00:31:24.251 --> 00:31:28.960
<v Speaker 1>representation of advance as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>multilayered neurological phenomenon.</v>

541
00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:32.830
<v Speaker 1>And so if you were in town or something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's unexpected or frightening,</v>

542
00:31:32.831 --> 00:31:34.720
<v Speaker 1>the first thing that happens is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

543
00:31:34.721 --> 00:31:37.720
<v Speaker 1>very ancient reflex of systems act </v>
<v Speaker 1>first.</v>

544
00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:41.290
<v Speaker 1>And those things are fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the sort of thing that for</v>

545
00:31:41.291 --> 00:31:44.050
<v Speaker 1>example might protect you against a </v>
<v Speaker 1>snake bite.</v>

546
00:31:44.051 --> 00:31:46.330
<v Speaker 1>If a snake jumped out at you are going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to jump backwards.</v>

547
00:31:46.331 --> 00:31:47.164
<v Speaker 1>And believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do that before you even see the </v>

548
00:31:48.881 --> 00:31:49.714
<v Speaker 1>snake because it probably takes you a </v>
<v Speaker 1>quarter of a second to produce complex </v>

549
00:31:53.471 --> 00:31:54.304
<v Speaker 1>visual representation of the snake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you wait around for a quarter of </v>

550
00:31:57.251 --> 00:31:58.960
<v Speaker 1>a second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're dead.</v>

551
00:31:59.170 --> 00:32:00.003
<v Speaker 1>And so what's happened is that your </v>
<v Speaker 1>nervous system has conserved basic </v>

552
00:32:03.881 --> 00:32:06.840
<v Speaker 1>reflexes that are only a few snaps as </v>
<v Speaker 1>long.</v>

553
00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:10.420
<v Speaker 1>So maybe those work between your retina </v>
<v Speaker 1>and your spinal cord,</v>

554
00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:11.553
<v Speaker 1>your retina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe a very primordial emotional </v>

555
00:32:13.541 --> 00:32:13.960
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

556
00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:14.793
<v Speaker 1>Like the Amygdala is wired up to detect </v>
<v Speaker 1>things like snakes and it just sends a </v>

557
00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:19.233
<v Speaker 1>message down to your spinal cord or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or slightly more sophisticated motor </v>

558
00:32:22.871 --> 00:32:23.704
<v Speaker 1>control systems that says jump backwards</v>
<v Speaker 1>now and then maybe you think about it </v>

559
00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:27.933
<v Speaker 1>isn't even till after that that your </v>
<v Speaker 1>heart rate goes up and your blood </v>

560
00:32:31.061 --> 00:32:31.894
<v Speaker 1>pressure goes up and you start to </v>
<v Speaker 1>breathe heavily and then there's a wave </v>

561
00:32:34.511 --> 00:32:35.344
<v Speaker 1>of fear and revulsion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is perhaps there to teach you not </v>

562
00:32:38.321 --> 00:32:40.820
<v Speaker 1>to do such a stupid thing again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

563
00:32:40.821 --> 00:32:44.600
<v Speaker 1>we don't exactly know why you would </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience negative emotion,</v>

564
00:32:44.601 --> 00:32:45.434
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or what function the negative emotion </v>

565
00:32:46.761 --> 00:32:47.594
<v Speaker 1>has except that we do know that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pattern of neurological behavior that's </v>

566
00:32:51.891 --> 00:32:52.724
<v Speaker 1>followed by a punishment or a threat is </v>
<v Speaker 1>likely less likely to be re implemented </v>

567
00:32:58.551 --> 00:32:59.780
<v Speaker 1>in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

568
00:32:59.781 --> 00:33:00.614
<v Speaker 1>so the reaction to the anomalous thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>is barley and then maybe it's emotion </v>

569
00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:09.230
<v Speaker 1>and then maybe it's image like </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagination.</v>

570
00:33:09.231 --> 00:33:10.064
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what just happened and then maybe it's </v>

571
00:33:11.301 --> 00:33:12.134
<v Speaker 1>articulated speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but lots of things don't get past image </v>

572
00:33:15.261 --> 00:33:16.094
<v Speaker 1>to articulate in speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some things I think don't even get </v>

573
00:33:18.801 --> 00:33:19.820
<v Speaker 1>past body.</v>

574
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:24.833
<v Speaker 2>Sorry about that.</v>

575
00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:30.333
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think that these traumatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>memories are so much repressed as Freud </v>

576
00:33:34.121 --> 00:33:37.630
<v Speaker 1>had it as never brought forward for </v>
<v Speaker 1>development.</v>

577
00:33:37.631 --> 00:33:39.010
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

578
00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:40.353
<v Speaker 1>let me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you a story about how this </v>

579
00:33:41.381 --> 00:33:42.250
<v Speaker 1>might work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

580
00:33:42.251 --> 00:33:45.790
<v Speaker 1>So one time I had this client,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was about 27 I only saw her once.</v>

581
00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:48.430
<v Speaker 1>This is when I was just training to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapist.</v>

582
00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:50.013
<v Speaker 1>And she came into me and she said that </v>
<v Speaker 1>she had been plagued by these thoughts </v>

583
00:33:54.971 --> 00:33:57.910
<v Speaker 1>of being sexually abused when she was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>child.</v>

584
00:33:58.570 --> 00:33:59.620
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

585
00:34:00.130 --> 00:34:02.140
<v Speaker 1>who was doing this to you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she said,</v>

586
00:34:02.141 --> 00:34:03.280
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was my brother.</v>

587
00:34:03.281 --> 00:34:05.920
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she said he was a lot older than me.</v>

588
00:34:06.490 --> 00:34:10.030
<v Speaker 1>And so I formulated this mental model of</v>
<v Speaker 1>her being,</v>

589
00:34:10.031 --> 00:34:10.864
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere between 10 and 13 and her </v>

590
00:34:12.161 --> 00:34:12.994
<v Speaker 1>brother being somewhere between say 15 </v>
<v Speaker 1>and 20 because the way she described it </v>

591
00:34:16.961 --> 00:34:17.850
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

592
00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:22.300
<v Speaker 1>that she was overpowered by our larger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a physically larger male.</v>

593
00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:25.600
<v Speaker 1>So we talked for awhile and then she </v>
<v Speaker 1>finally told me,</v>

594
00:34:25.601 --> 00:34:25.991
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

595
00:34:25.991 --> 00:34:28.030
<v Speaker 1>how old were you when this happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she said,</v>

596
00:34:28.031 --> 00:34:29.170
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was four.</v>

597
00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:30.371
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now,</v>

598
00:34:30.371 --> 00:34:31.181
<v Speaker 1>and then I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

599
00:34:31.181 --> 00:34:33.040
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how old was your brother?</v>

600
00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:34.151
<v Speaker 1>And she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

601
00:34:34.151 --> 00:34:36.790
<v Speaker 1>he was six.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I said,</v>

602
00:34:36.791 --> 00:34:37.900
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

603
00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:38.973
<v Speaker 1>here's one way of looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're looking at it from the </v>

604
00:34:41.531 --> 00:34:44.920
<v Speaker 1>perspective of the four year old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a regression in some sense.</v>

605
00:34:44.921 --> 00:34:49.480
<v Speaker 1>That's still how old you are as far as </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiencing the memory.</v>

606
00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:54.550
<v Speaker 1>Here's an alternative hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your brother wasn't a Predator,</v>

607
00:34:54.610 --> 00:34:57.850
<v Speaker 1>you were both terribly supervise </v>
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>

608
00:34:58.870 --> 00:35:00.850
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

609
00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:05.200
<v Speaker 1>that made the lights go on and you're in</v>
<v Speaker 1>her mind because she never thought about</v>

610
00:35:05.201 --> 00:35:06.034
<v Speaker 1>it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like she'd never taken that </v>

611
00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:08.433
<v Speaker 1>representation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would be her emotional experience </v>

612
00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:12.910
<v Speaker 1>as a four year old related to a six year</v>
<v Speaker 1>old.</v>

613
00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:15.880
<v Speaker 1>A six year old is a lot bigger and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful than the four year olds.</v>

614
00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:16.743
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

615
00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:18.730
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's you know,</v>

616
00:35:18.731 --> 00:35:21.940
<v Speaker 1>50% owner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a big deal when you're four.</v>

617
00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:23.373
<v Speaker 1>But if the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the issue for the memory is its </v>

618
00:35:26.651 --> 00:35:30.160
<v Speaker 1>relevance to current conceptualization </v>
<v Speaker 1>and behavior,</v>

619
00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:33.670
<v Speaker 1>it was much better for her to update the</v>
<v Speaker 1>memory in a sense.</v>

620
00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:35.890
<v Speaker 1>And think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well yeah,</v>

621
00:35:35.891 --> 00:35:39.360
<v Speaker 1>like a six year olds this and like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>four year olds this high.</v>

622
00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:40.203
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell were my parents doing </v>

623
00:35:41.071 --> 00:35:41.904
<v Speaker 1>anyways?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's an entirely different story </v>

624
00:35:44.041 --> 00:35:45.100
<v Speaker 1>than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than the one.</v>

625
00:35:45.101 --> 00:35:47.250
<v Speaker 1>And she had come up with come in with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

626
00:35:47.251 --> 00:35:49.020
<v Speaker 1>and that seemed to be a great relief to </v>
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>

627
00:35:49.021 --> 00:35:51.570
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

628
00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:53.910
<v Speaker 1>if you're bothered by a traumatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>memory,</v>

629
00:35:53.911 --> 00:35:54.744
<v Speaker 1>it keeps resurfacing on which it will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's actually one of the ways of </v>

630
00:35:58.230 --> 00:36:01.710
<v Speaker 1>identifying a traumatic memory is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing won't leave you alone.</v>

631
00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:05.460
<v Speaker 1>It keeps coming up and dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when your mind is wandering,</v>

632
00:36:05.461 --> 00:36:06.294
<v Speaker 1>it'll keep coming up when your mind is </v>
<v Speaker 1>wandering and maybe it'll come up when </v>

633
00:36:08.581 --> 00:36:11.520
<v Speaker 1>you're going to sleep at night and like </v>
<v Speaker 1>it invades your mind.</v>

634
00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:16.380
<v Speaker 1>There's a reason for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason is is that the underlying</v>

635
00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:19.380
<v Speaker 1>emotional systems that are associated </v>
<v Speaker 1>with anxiety,</v>

636
00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:24.530
<v Speaker 1>so those are mostly hippocampus and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Amygdala duel duo in some sense that are</v>

637
00:36:24.811 --> 00:36:25.644
<v Speaker 1>mediating those there an alarm system </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the alarm is something that's </v>

638
00:36:30.601 --> 00:36:31.434
<v Speaker 1>potentially dangerous has happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to figure out what it means so </v>

639
00:36:34.261 --> 00:36:36.630
<v Speaker 1>that you can miss stop that from </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening in the future.</v>

640
00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:38.160
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you need a plan,</v>

641
00:36:38.161 --> 00:36:38.994
<v Speaker 1>you need and get applied and you do have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do a causal analysis of the </v>

642
00:36:42.361 --> 00:36:45.840
<v Speaker 1>relationship between your behavior and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the traumatic outcome.</v>

643
00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:49.530
<v Speaker 1>That would be the first thing and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to come up with a way that that</v>

644
00:36:49.531 --> 00:36:50.550
<v Speaker 1>won't happen again.</v>

645
00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:52.253
<v Speaker 1>And of course for my client,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that happened pretty much right away </v>

646
00:36:54.811 --> 00:36:55.644
<v Speaker 1>because now she was a 27 year old woman </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the probability that she was going </v>

647
00:36:58.501 --> 00:36:59.334
<v Speaker 1>to be subject in any serious way to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation the same as the one she was </v>

648
00:37:04.291 --> 00:37:07.380
<v Speaker 1>remembering was zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

649
00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:10.130
<v Speaker 1>and I've seen this in other clients too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is when,</v>

650
00:37:10.131 --> 00:37:11.160
<v Speaker 1>when they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're,</v>

651
00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:12.570
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

652
00:37:12.571 --> 00:37:15.150
<v Speaker 1>I had another client who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

653
00:37:15.151 --> 00:37:16.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when she was,</v>

654
00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:19.910
<v Speaker 1>I think I told you about her briefly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when she was young,</v>

655
00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:20.753
<v Speaker 1>four years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she jumped in a shopping cart and went </v>

656
00:37:23.761 --> 00:37:24.594
<v Speaker 1>down a hill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a paved hill in the shopping cart </v>

657
00:37:26.421 --> 00:37:27.254
<v Speaker 1>is filled out at the bottom and hurt </v>
<v Speaker 1>herself and they took her to the </v>

658
00:37:29.521 --> 00:37:30.354
<v Speaker 1>hospital and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then she's all primed for being </v>

659
00:37:32.911 --> 00:37:33.780
<v Speaker 1>threatened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

660
00:37:34.170 --> 00:37:36.480
<v Speaker 1>so that kind of means you're open to </v>
<v Speaker 1>rewire.</v>

661
00:37:36.481 --> 00:37:37.290
<v Speaker 1>We need some sense.</v>

662
00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:38.123
<v Speaker 1>And so then when she's in the hospital,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't let her parents come and see </v>

663
00:37:40.741 --> 00:37:42.090
<v Speaker 1>her for a couple of weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

664
00:37:42.091 --> 00:37:42.924
<v Speaker 1>so the trauma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pain and the anxiety and the threat </v>

665
00:37:46.261 --> 00:37:48.030
<v Speaker 1>than the ambulance ride and all those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

666
00:37:48.031 --> 00:37:50.490
<v Speaker 1>which sort of puts you in a state like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

667
00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:52.800
<v Speaker 1>which might be at like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

668
00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:53.783
<v Speaker 1>state that's particularly conducive to </v>
<v Speaker 1>learning if something traumatic is </v>

669
00:37:57.301 --> 00:37:59.340
<v Speaker 1>happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should be learning about that,</v>

670
00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:01.260
<v Speaker 1>what the world's like around that right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

671
00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:02.693
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

672
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:07.790
<v Speaker 1>she developed it a permanent trauma </v>
<v Speaker 1>related paranoia about institutions,</v>

673
00:38:08.581 --> 00:38:09.414
<v Speaker 1>which turned by the time I met her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had turned into a whole philosophy of </v>

674
00:38:12.901 --> 00:38:16.630
<v Speaker 1>institutional oppression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's core was that terror.</v>

675
00:38:16.631 --> 00:38:18.000
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rightly so,</v>

676
00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:18.923
<v Speaker 1>it's core was that combination of </v>
<v Speaker 1>physiological trauma and psychological </v>

677
00:38:22.741 --> 00:38:23.574
<v Speaker 1>trauma and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mishandling of the situation by people </v>

678
00:38:28.021 --> 00:38:29.910
<v Speaker 1>in authority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

679
00:38:31.110 --> 00:38:31.943
<v Speaker 1>so you can see under those circumstances</v>
<v Speaker 1>how a traumatic memory can become the </v>

680
00:38:34.651 --> 00:38:37.250
<v Speaker 1>core,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a whole large subpersonality.</v>

681
00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:39.760
<v Speaker 1>Now it has to be taken apart very </v>
<v Speaker 1>carefully,</v>

682
00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:40.923
<v Speaker 1>especially if that sub personality isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kind that can be easily integrated </v>

683
00:38:44.621 --> 00:38:45.760
<v Speaker 1>into the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

684
00:38:45.761 --> 00:38:46.594
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're paranoid about all </v>

685
00:38:48.011 --> 00:38:48.844
<v Speaker 1>institutions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in real trouble because in a </v>

686
00:38:50.861 --> 00:38:51.694
<v Speaker 1>modern world you're faced with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's necessity of dealing with </v>

687
00:38:53.921 --> 00:38:54.754
<v Speaker 1>institutions all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're more distrustful and </v>

688
00:38:58.211 --> 00:39:01.450
<v Speaker 1>paranoid about them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you couldn't be,</v>

689
00:39:01.451 --> 00:39:03.940
<v Speaker 1>if you were sophisticated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that's going to happen is they're</v>

690
00:39:03.941 --> 00:39:06.010
<v Speaker 1>going to continually mistreat you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

691
00:39:06.011 --> 00:39:07.900
<v Speaker 1>Cause I mean if a dog comes up to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

692
00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:10.750
<v Speaker 1>it's looking suspiciously and barking </v>
<v Speaker 1>and growling,</v>

693
00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:13.180
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to pet it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

694
00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:17.560
<v Speaker 1>the way you interact with the system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends the,</v>

695
00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:18.453
<v Speaker 1>the reaction of a system to you is </v>
<v Speaker 1>dependent to a large degree on how you </v>

696
00:39:22.061 --> 00:39:24.580
<v Speaker 1>approached the system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

697
00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:27.100
<v Speaker 1>the dissociate ability ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a really good one</v>

698
00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:30.040
<v Speaker 2>mean</v>

699
00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:32.440
<v Speaker 1>if you want to get to know yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

700
00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:35.500
<v Speaker 1>And this is sort of a combination of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud and in union ideas.</v>

701
00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:36.693
<v Speaker 1>One of the things to do is to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so imagine that you have some sort of </v>

702
00:39:39.431 --> 00:39:42.310
<v Speaker 1>goal in mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first question is you that you might</v>

703
00:39:42.311 --> 00:39:45.460
<v Speaker 1>ask yourself is why do you have that </v>
<v Speaker 1>goal?</v>

704
00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:48.940
<v Speaker 1>What are the influences on you that have</v>
<v Speaker 1>set that goal up?</v>

705
00:39:48.941 --> 00:39:49.774
<v Speaker 1>Cause it easily could be conscious or </v>
<v Speaker 1>partially conscious or poorly explained </v>

706
00:39:55.121 --> 00:39:57.550
<v Speaker 1>or implicit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any of those things.</v>

707
00:39:57.551 --> 00:40:00.460
<v Speaker 1>So you want to know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are you doing what you're doing?</v>

708
00:40:01.830 --> 00:40:02.500
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

709
00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:03.333
<v Speaker 1>And the second thing is if you find </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself avoiding things on the way to </v>

710
00:40:07.571 --> 00:40:08.404
<v Speaker 1>that goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next question is why are you </v>

711
00:40:10.721 --> 00:40:12.700
<v Speaker 1>avoiding them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

712
00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:16.360
<v Speaker 1>that'll mean delving into parts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself that are quite hidden and quite</v>

713
00:40:16.361 --> 00:40:17.890
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

714
00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:19.113
<v Speaker 1>if you discovered that the reason you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>pursuing a particular goal is because </v>

715
00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:27.780
<v Speaker 1>it's what your parents want you to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one question that immediate you're rises</v>

716
00:40:28.241 --> 00:40:29.080
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

717
00:40:29.081 --> 00:40:29.914
<v Speaker 1>but is that what you want to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know that that's a very </v>

718
00:40:34.541 --> 00:40:38.980
<v Speaker 1>complicated question because you'd have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to dissociate the part of you that's the</v>

719
00:40:38.981 --> 00:40:39.814
<v Speaker 1>you that doesn't want to do it from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of you that's the you that does </v>

720
00:40:42.821 --> 00:40:43.654
<v Speaker 1>want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to figure out why in </v>

721
00:40:45.611 --> 00:40:47.350
<v Speaker 1>the world you'd be avoiding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

722
00:40:47.351 --> 00:40:48.184
<v Speaker 1>it might be that you're an unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 1>angry that you've been tilted towards </v>

723
00:40:52.901 --> 00:40:56.500
<v Speaker 1>this particular goal for reasons that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have nothing to do with your choice.</v>

724
00:40:56.680 --> 00:41:00.970
<v Speaker 1>And so that every time you have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to study or,</v>

725
00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:04.930
<v Speaker 1>or accomplish something that would move </v>
<v Speaker 1>you farther to that goal,</v>

726
00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:08.230
<v Speaker 1>you're either not motivated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can't pay attention,</v>

727
00:41:08.231 --> 00:41:09.880
<v Speaker 1>you can't study,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't learn,</v>

728
00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:10.833
<v Speaker 1>and you procrastinate all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you actually do seriously </v>

729
00:41:14.201 --> 00:41:15.970
<v Speaker 1>counterproductive thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people,</v>

730
00:41:15.971 --> 00:41:17.920
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people can be</v>

731
00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:20.480
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

732
00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:22.790
<v Speaker 1>I just had someone write me here a while</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

733
00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:23.813
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he was watching the youtube </v>

734
00:41:24.561 --> 00:41:27.980
<v Speaker 1>lectures and he said that he had dreams </v>
<v Speaker 1>for six weeks,</v>

735
00:41:27.981 --> 00:41:31.190
<v Speaker 1>that he drove his car off a cliff and </v>
<v Speaker 1>crashed it.</v>

736
00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:32.653
<v Speaker 1>And then at the end of the series,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he drove his car off the cliff and </v>

737
00:41:35.571 --> 00:41:36.404
<v Speaker 1>crashed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he asked me what that meant and I </v>

738
00:41:37.791 --> 00:41:38.624
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

739
00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:42.680
<v Speaker 1>the dream is telling you that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>being far too careless with your life.</v>

740
00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:47.660
<v Speaker 1>Like that's what driving cliff off a car</v>
<v Speaker 1>off a cliff repeatedly needs.</v>

741
00:41:47.661 --> 00:41:48.680
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

742
00:41:48.681 --> 00:41:52.160
<v Speaker 1>that's a good descent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious descent into the underworld.</v>

743
00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:54.360
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was being warned,</v>

744
00:41:54.690 --> 00:41:57.950
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the psychological reality was such that</v>

745
00:41:59.730 --> 00:42:02.700
<v Speaker 1>the warning was extremely serious and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the danger.</v>

746
00:42:02.701 --> 00:42:03.750
<v Speaker 1>And so then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

747
00:42:03.751 --> 00:42:06.150
<v Speaker 1>why would he drive himself off a cliff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

748
00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:08.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a suicidal gesture.</v>

749
00:42:08.371 --> 00:42:09.240
<v Speaker 1>And then you might ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

750
00:42:09.241 --> 00:42:11.640
<v Speaker 1>why would money be suicidal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that could be,</v>

751
00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:12.713
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're out for revenge against their </v>

752
00:42:13.471 --> 00:42:14.304
<v Speaker 1>parents or they're out for revenge </v>
<v Speaker 1>against the whole world or they're out </v>

753
00:42:16.561 --> 00:42:17.394
<v Speaker 1>for revenge against themselves or they </v>
<v Speaker 1>just want to make their painful </v>

754
00:42:19.951 --> 00:42:20.784
<v Speaker 1>consciousness go away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or they're living a messy and pointless </v>

755
00:42:23.970 --> 00:42:24.803
<v Speaker 1>and painful life and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they want to punish themselves for </v>

756
00:42:27.031 --> 00:42:27.790
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

757
00:42:27.790 --> 00:42:28.623
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very complicated and tangled down there </v>

758
00:42:30.991 --> 00:42:34.440
<v Speaker 1>at the bottom of things and people don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>really like to look into it.</v>

759
00:42:34.441 --> 00:42:35.274
<v Speaker 1>And I suppose to some degree that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shadow element because what you find </v>

760
00:42:39.241 --> 00:42:42.980
<v Speaker 1>there is seldom what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

761
00:42:42.990 --> 00:42:43.823
<v Speaker 1>one of the prime victims of unions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapy and most psychotherapies </v>

762
00:42:47.581 --> 00:42:50.910
<v Speaker 1>are predicated on the idea that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should find out what you're avoiding and</v>

763
00:42:50.911 --> 00:42:53.370
<v Speaker 1>then you should figure out how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily face it.</v>

764
00:42:53.730 --> 00:42:54.563
<v Speaker 1>Now you might add to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should find out what you're doing </v>

765
00:42:57.211 --> 00:43:00.810
<v Speaker 1>and why and see if that's actually what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to be doing.</v>

766
00:43:01.350 --> 00:43:02.183
<v Speaker 1>And if those reasons are reasons you </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that might you know in some sense </v>

767
00:43:05.461 --> 00:43:08.340
<v Speaker 1>some up therapy in a couple of phrases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

768
00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:11.353
<v Speaker 1>in order to manage that then you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at all the things you've been </v>

769
00:43:14.271 --> 00:43:15.260
<v Speaker 1>avoiding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

770
00:43:15.261 --> 00:43:16.370
<v Speaker 1>what do you avoid?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

771
00:43:16.371 --> 00:43:18.410
<v Speaker 1>it isn't rainbows and cookies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

772
00:43:18.650 --> 00:43:19.483
<v Speaker 1>The things that you avoid are the things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that no one wants to look at and so </v>

773
00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:26.660
<v Speaker 1>humans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>primary dictum for his psychotherapeutic</v>

774
00:43:26.661 --> 00:43:30.860
<v Speaker 1>practice was a Latin phrase which is in </v>
<v Speaker 1>sterk wiliness invented tour,</v>

775
00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:31.873
<v Speaker 1>which I'm probably pronouncing wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means either in fill it will be </v>

776
00:43:35.631 --> 00:43:40.631
<v Speaker 1>found or where are you want most is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be found where you least want to look.</v>

777
00:43:41.330 --> 00:43:42.860
<v Speaker 1>You know those nausea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what that,</v>

778
00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:47.060
<v Speaker 1>that's how horrible philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can see that it's almost self.</v>

779
00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:52.070
<v Speaker 1>It's almost self fulfilling because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>course the things you're going to avoid.</v>

780
00:43:52.071 --> 00:43:53.750
<v Speaker 1>Are there things that you don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>face?</v>

781
00:43:53.810 --> 00:43:54.643
<v Speaker 1>Obviously now the shadow element of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>psyche in some sense when you were </v>

782
00:43:59.691 --> 00:44:01.610
<v Speaker 1>watching the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

783
00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:02.623
<v Speaker 1>you saw these drives mostly sexual and </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggressive that were manifesting </v>

784
00:44:06.381 --> 00:44:07.820
<v Speaker 1>themselves in all sorts of ways.</v>

785
00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:11.390
<v Speaker 1>And so that would be navy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the repressed or unincorporated elements</v>

786
00:44:11.391 --> 00:44:13.580
<v Speaker 1>of the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then there was a side of,</v>

787
00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:17.480
<v Speaker 1>there was another more complex side of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that where the,</v>

788
00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:18.740
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

789
00:44:19.070 --> 00:44:22.400
<v Speaker 1>the people were reacting to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

790
00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:25.000
<v Speaker 1>cause they felt downtrodden and </v>
<v Speaker 1>oppressed and,</v>

791
00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:26.263
<v Speaker 1>and antisocial and critical of social </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure and all of that because they </v>

792
00:44:31.621 --> 00:44:34.830
<v Speaker 1>were unable to manifest themselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>properly in the world.</v>

793
00:44:35.070 --> 00:44:38.490
<v Speaker 1>And that produced fantasies of extreme </v>
<v Speaker 1>destruction,</v>

794
00:44:38.491 --> 00:44:40.240
<v Speaker 1>exceptional destruction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and for them,</v>

795
00:44:40.241 --> 00:44:41.074
<v Speaker 1>and they were mostly sexually related,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for other people that can manifest </v>

796
00:44:44.431 --> 00:44:45.264
<v Speaker 1>itself in incredibly violent fantasies </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the destruction of society as </v>

797
00:44:49.201 --> 00:44:50.034
<v Speaker 1>such.</v>

798
00:44:50.590 --> 00:44:51.423
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

799
00:44:52.130 --> 00:44:55.040
<v Speaker 1>if you can't invite all the parts of you</v>
<v Speaker 1>out to play,</v>

800
00:44:55.041 --> 00:44:58.100
<v Speaker 1>the parts that get left behind are not </v>
<v Speaker 1>very happy about it.</v>

801
00:44:58.101 --> 00:45:00.410
<v Speaker 1>And they don't just sit around having a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tea party,</v>

802
00:45:00.770 --> 00:45:01.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they turn into,</v>

803
00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:03.710
<v Speaker 1>they turned in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially as you mature,</v>

804
00:45:03.830 --> 00:45:07.340
<v Speaker 1>they turn into these work monsters and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

805
00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:11.240
<v Speaker 1>their mode of action in the world is </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything but positive.</v>

806
00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:15.260
<v Speaker 1>And the Freudian world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

807
00:45:15.450 --> 00:45:16.283
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world of the psychoanalytic </v>

808
00:45:17.511 --> 00:45:18.344
<v Speaker 1>unconscious is quite a terrifying place </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it makes you second guess </v>

809
00:45:22.551 --> 00:45:23.570
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

810
00:45:23.810 --> 00:45:25.670
<v Speaker 1>it's not a paranoia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

811
00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:27.930
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

812
00:45:27.930 --> 00:45:30.030
<v Speaker 1>You never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>

813
00:45:30.031 --> 00:45:30.864
<v Speaker 1>very difficult once you're trained </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalytically to ever assume that </v>

814
00:45:35.221 --> 00:45:40.020
<v Speaker 1>someone's benevolent motivations are </v>
<v Speaker 1>only what they claim they are.</v>

815
00:45:40.350 --> 00:45:43.530
<v Speaker 1>You're always looking for the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>missing piece.</v>

816
00:45:43.770 --> 00:45:46.110
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's extremely useful </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

817
00:45:46.111 --> 00:45:46.944
<v Speaker 1>you run into people in particular to </v>
<v Speaker 1>idiot logs who will claim that they're </v>

818
00:45:50.011 --> 00:45:52.230
<v Speaker 1>acting on the world's behalf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

819
00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:54.653
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who made you is saying and why should I </v>

820
00:45:57.451 --> 00:45:59.550
<v Speaker 1>believe that all the good is on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>side?</v>

821
00:45:59.551 --> 00:46:01.590
<v Speaker 1>Like what is it that you're not talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about?</v>

822
00:46:01.591 --> 00:46:04.650
<v Speaker 1>What it is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it that you're not revealing?</v>

823
00:46:04.830 --> 00:46:07.320
<v Speaker 1>I got something from Greenpeace once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

824
00:46:07.321 --> 00:46:12.321
<v Speaker 1>that was asking for donations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the brochure was just photographs of</v>

825
00:46:12.541 --> 00:46:14.610
<v Speaker 1>all the people who were on the board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

826
00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:16.023
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

827
00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:18.493
<v Speaker 1>why do I want to see photographs of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the people who are on the board of </v>

828
00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:22.053
<v Speaker 1>Greenpeace?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or the other question is why do they </v>

829
00:46:24.471 --> 00:46:27.680
<v Speaker 1>want to show them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you don't have to fake very hard to</v>

830
00:46:27.681 --> 00:46:29.120
<v Speaker 1>figure that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

831
00:46:29.121 --> 00:46:29.954
<v Speaker 1>it's a status maneuver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you'd expect in a mail out like </v>

832
00:46:32.871 --> 00:46:33.441
<v Speaker 1>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

833
00:46:33.441 --> 00:46:37.430
<v Speaker 1>here's six things that we've done in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>last year that improve the planet.</v>

834
00:46:37.431 --> 00:46:38.264
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what we spent in relationship to </v>

835
00:46:41.361 --> 00:46:44.180
<v Speaker 1>administrative costs and here's why it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a good idea,</v>

836
00:46:44.210 --> 00:46:48.740
<v Speaker 1>not here's our leaders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there's something wrong there.</v>

837
00:46:48.830 --> 00:46:49.663
<v Speaker 1>And I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I picked Greenpeace cause it just </v>

838
00:46:51.051 --> 00:46:53.480
<v Speaker 1>happened to pop in money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's the case for all sorts of,</v>

839
00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:55.100
<v Speaker 1>of organizations.</v>

840
00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:59.170
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

841
00:46:59.171 --> 00:46:59.950
<v Speaker 3>so</v>

842
00:46:59.950 --> 00:47:04.360
<v Speaker 1>freud by 1900 had identified a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different functions of the unconscious.</v>

843
00:47:04.361 --> 00:47:08.110
<v Speaker 1>And so here's four of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One was the unconscious,</v>

844
00:47:08.111 --> 00:47:08.944
<v Speaker 1>how to conservative function,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which meant that it stored memories </v>

845
00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:14.500
<v Speaker 1>often unaccessible to voluntary recall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

846
00:47:14.501 --> 00:47:17.500
<v Speaker 1>we don't really know how memories are </v>
<v Speaker 1>stored in the brain,</v>

847
00:47:17.501 --> 00:47:18.334
<v Speaker 1>but here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's I guess so when you have an </v>

848
00:47:21.761 --> 00:47:22.594
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine that that produces a pattern of </v>

849
00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:29.780
<v Speaker 1>neural activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just neuro,</v>

850
00:47:29.781 --> 00:47:33.680
<v Speaker 1>but a pattern of that activity in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain and in your body,</v>

851
00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:40.180
<v Speaker 1>at least part of how you remember is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>reactivate that pattern,</v>

852
00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:41.373
<v Speaker 1>but it's not that simple obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise you docked out all </v>

853
00:47:44.951 --> 00:47:48.880
<v Speaker 1>your memories precisely and we don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know exactly how that initial</v>

854
00:47:50.450 --> 00:47:54.170
<v Speaker 1>pattern of experience gets edited down </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the thing you remember,</v>

855
00:47:54.171 --> 00:47:55.004
<v Speaker 1>but we do know that it it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets edited down in some ways as a </v>

856
00:47:58.701 --> 00:48:02.000
<v Speaker 1>consequence of its relevance to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>current goal structure.</v>

857
00:48:02.450 --> 00:48:06.680
<v Speaker 1>How that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems computationally impossible.</v>

858
00:48:06.681 --> 00:48:08.900
<v Speaker 1>We really don't understand how it </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens at all.</v>

859
00:48:08.901 --> 00:48:13.220
<v Speaker 1>We don't understand how you can compute </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's relevant and what isn't.</v>

860
00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:17.540
<v Speaker 1>It seems that the world is too complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>for that to even be possible.</v>

861
00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:19.093
<v Speaker 1>So Conservative dissoluted the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious contains habits once </v>

862
00:48:22.671 --> 00:48:26.600
<v Speaker 1>voluntary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now automatized and dissociated elements</v>

863
00:48:26.601 --> 00:48:29.660
<v Speaker 1>of the personality which may lead a </v>
<v Speaker 1>parasitic existence.</v>

864
00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:30.853
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I talked to a little bit about </v>

865
00:48:33.590 --> 00:48:34.423
<v Speaker 1>traumatic memories and how they might </v>
<v Speaker 1>form the node of the development of the </v>

866
00:48:36.981 --> 00:48:37.814
<v Speaker 1>subpersonality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's something else that's worth </v>

867
00:48:39.681 --> 00:48:42.960
<v Speaker 1>understanding too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say you,</v>

868
00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:44.053
<v Speaker 1>you start practicing a new minor mode of</v>
<v Speaker 1>being a new attitude or a new </v>

869
00:48:48.501 --> 00:48:50.810
<v Speaker 1>personality attribute or new habit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

870
00:48:51.020 --> 00:48:54.800
<v Speaker 1>It can be a fairly small thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you first start practicing it,</v>

871
00:48:54.801 --> 00:48:57.710
<v Speaker 1>you're not very good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For those of you who are musicians,</v>

872
00:48:57.950 --> 00:48:59.840
<v Speaker 1>you know when you first start to play a </v>
<v Speaker 1>piece,</v>

873
00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:02.840
<v Speaker 1>you're very inefficient at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the more you practice it,</v>

874
00:49:02.841 --> 00:49:04.730
<v Speaker 1>the more efficient you get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

875
00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:07.100
<v Speaker 1>it's quite weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a very good pianist,</v>

876
00:49:07.101 --> 00:49:09.200
<v Speaker 1>but I learned to play one really </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult song.</v>

877
00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:11.720
<v Speaker 1>But the terrible thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a learn to play it.</v>

878
00:49:11.870 --> 00:49:15.050
<v Speaker 1>And then at some point I'll realize that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the notes anymore.</v>

879
00:49:15.230 --> 00:49:16.940
<v Speaker 1>And as soon as I realized I don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>the notes,</v>

880
00:49:16.941 --> 00:49:18.890
<v Speaker 1>I can't use those habit patterns </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

881
00:49:19.130 --> 00:49:20.510
<v Speaker 1>And then I have to figure out the notes </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

882
00:49:20.511 --> 00:49:21.680
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very annoying,</v>

883
00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:22.873
<v Speaker 1>but anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you first start practicing </v>

884
00:49:24.381 --> 00:49:25.760
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's effortful.</v>

885
00:49:25.761 --> 00:49:30.020
<v Speaker 1>It requires a lot of brain activation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what the scanning studies show,</v>

886
00:49:30.021 --> 00:49:30.854
<v Speaker 1>but as you practice it more and more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount of the brain that you use </v>

887
00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:35.450
<v Speaker 1>starts to shrink.</v>

888
00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:36.353
<v Speaker 1>It generally moves left cause the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>hemisphere is more involved in novelty </v>

889
00:49:39.651 --> 00:49:40.484
<v Speaker 1>processing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It generally moves left and then it </v>

890
00:49:42.051 --> 00:49:42.884
<v Speaker 1>moves back and the area gets smaller and</v>
<v Speaker 1>smaller and smaller until you've </v>

891
00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:50.930
<v Speaker 1>generated up a little machine or it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little hard wired.</v>

892
00:49:50.931 --> 00:49:53.960
<v Speaker 1>Some personality that takes care of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular operation.</v>

893
00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:55.033
<v Speaker 1>Now that's where thinking about too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because what that means in some senses </v>

894
00:49:58.070 --> 00:50:02.540
<v Speaker 1>that your brain is full of the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you've practiced,</v>

895
00:50:03.470 --> 00:50:05.840
<v Speaker 1>and that's not exactly psychological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

896
00:50:05.841 --> 00:50:08.480
<v Speaker 1>It's psychophysiological.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's part of your psyche,</v>

897
00:50:08.481 --> 00:50:09.314
<v Speaker 1>but it's also hardwired into your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to overcome one of those </v>

898
00:50:11.991 --> 00:50:12.824
<v Speaker 1>habits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to build a new machine that </v>

899
00:50:13.971 --> 00:50:14.804
<v Speaker 1>shuts it off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't just get rid of it and then </v>

900
00:50:17.241 --> 00:50:20.090
<v Speaker 1>what happens if you get stressed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Often that new machine will get,</v>

901
00:50:23.570 --> 00:50:24.403
<v Speaker 1>don't know exactly how it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The stress will reduce the functioning </v>

902
00:50:27.110 --> 00:50:29.360
<v Speaker 1>of the new machine and old habit to pop </v>
<v Speaker 1>back up.</v>

903
00:50:29.570 --> 00:50:30.403
<v Speaker 1>Some of you all have noticed this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of you have moved away from </v>

904
00:50:33.471 --> 00:50:35.900
<v Speaker 1>home?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

905
00:50:35.901 --> 00:50:36.734
<v Speaker 1>so how many of you noticed when you go </v>
<v Speaker 1>to your family of origin that all sorts </v>

906
00:50:42.801 --> 00:50:43.634
<v Speaker 1>of personality traits that you thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>you abandoned immediately come flooding </v>

907
00:50:48.231 --> 00:50:50.000
<v Speaker 1>back?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So are you,</v>

908
00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:52.040
<v Speaker 1>you know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that sensation,</v>

909
00:50:52.041 --> 00:50:53.780
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go back there and it's like bang,</v>

910
00:50:53.781 --> 00:50:55.760
<v Speaker 1>there's a groove and you're right in it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

911
00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:59.540
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're as mature as a 30 year old </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're at your own house,</v>

912
00:50:59.541 --> 00:51:01.310
<v Speaker 1>but as soon as you come home it's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>poof,</v>

913
00:51:01.311 --> 00:51:02.144
<v Speaker 1>you're 14 again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's partly because that's the </v>

914
00:51:03.801 --> 00:51:06.500
<v Speaker 1>expectancy situation set up by your </v>
<v Speaker 1>parents.</v>

915
00:51:06.501 --> 00:51:07.334
<v Speaker 1>But it's also partly because you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't understand how much of your </v>

916
00:51:11.541 --> 00:51:15.270
<v Speaker 1>behavior is automatic and cued by </v>
<v Speaker 1>ongoing events.</v>

917
00:51:15.290 --> 00:51:17.570
<v Speaker 1>It's habitual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so those,</v>

918
00:51:17.571 --> 00:51:18.404
<v Speaker 1>you might think of those as somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 1>dissociated elements of the personality </v>

919
00:51:20.991 --> 00:51:23.090
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Creative,</v>

920
00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:27.650
<v Speaker 1>the unconscious serves as the matrix of </v>
<v Speaker 1>new ideas.</v>

921
00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:32.060
<v Speaker 1>So that's a more union idea and the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems to work.</v>

922
00:51:34.140 --> 00:51:34.973
<v Speaker 1>You might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how in the world can you come up with a </v>

923
00:51:36.331 --> 00:51:39.000
<v Speaker 1>new idea because it doesn't make sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

924
00:51:39.030 --> 00:51:42.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you conjuring something out of?</v>

925
00:51:42.031 --> 00:51:44.220
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

926
00:51:44.460 --> 00:51:47.010
<v Speaker 1>and you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well they're combinations of old ideas,</v>

927
00:51:47.011 --> 00:51:47.844
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not that helpful because you </v>

928
00:51:48.841 --> 00:51:52.050
<v Speaker 1>can't just take a bunch of old ideas and</v>
<v Speaker 1>like shuffled them and come up with some</v>

929
00:51:52.051 --> 00:51:55.500
<v Speaker 1>new spectacular ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot more complicated than that.</v>

930
00:51:56.130 --> 00:51:58.680
<v Speaker 1>So here's one way to think about</v>

931
00:52:00.770 --> 00:52:03.110
<v Speaker 1>brought forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>investigated in some sense,</v>

932
00:52:03.111 --> 00:52:03.944
<v Speaker 1>the surface of the creative unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was more concerned about the </v>

933
00:52:07.431 --> 00:52:11.810
<v Speaker 1>relay he called Freud's unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the personal unconscious.</v>

934
00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:12.823
<v Speaker 1>So that might be the unconscious that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have that's related specifically to </v>

935
00:52:15.981 --> 00:52:19.040
<v Speaker 1>your experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious and unconscious.</v>

936
00:52:19.041 --> 00:52:21.380
<v Speaker 1>Like it can be d you'll have a dream </v>
<v Speaker 1>once.</v>

937
00:52:21.381 --> 00:52:23.750
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hope I've got this right,</v>

938
00:52:24.290 --> 00:52:25.123
<v Speaker 1>that Freud and him were excavating the </v>
<v Speaker 1>basement of a structure and that and </v>

939
00:52:30.071 --> 00:52:34.070
<v Speaker 1>that you'll broke through and found </v>
<v Speaker 1>another huge structure underneath that.</v>

940
00:52:34.071 --> 00:52:38.390
<v Speaker 1>And that's just about exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's the personal unconscious.</v>

941
00:52:38.391 --> 00:52:40.220
<v Speaker 1>And then underneath that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in theory,</v>

942
00:52:40.370 --> 00:52:43.490
<v Speaker 1>there's what you'd called the collective</v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious and that would be,</v>

943
00:52:43.970 --> 00:52:48.530
<v Speaker 1>God only knows what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in part what it would be is whatever</v>

944
00:52:48.531 --> 00:52:49.364
<v Speaker 1>it is that makes you human from an </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary perspective and we don't </v>

945
00:52:52.731 --> 00:52:53.564
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you have a specific mode of being </v>

946
00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:59.300
<v Speaker 1>that's a human mode of big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was Eo Wilson,</v>

947
00:52:59.301 --> 00:53:04.301
<v Speaker 1>who's a great entomologist and also the </v>
<v Speaker 1>originator of sociobiology,</v>

948
00:53:07.551 --> 00:53:10.280
<v Speaker 1>which is like a branch of evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology.</v>

949
00:53:10.950 --> 00:53:11.783
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he studied dance forever and social </v>

950
00:53:13.671 --> 00:53:18.671
<v Speaker 1>behavior of ants and he's one sad if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we could talk to enhance,</v>

951
00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:21.470
<v Speaker 1>we wouldn't have anything to say to </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

952
00:53:22.490 --> 00:53:25.530
<v Speaker 1>And what he meant by that is that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>answer,</v>

953
00:53:25.531 --> 00:53:28.620
<v Speaker 1>interested in a bunch of things that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>just don't care about at all.</v>

954
00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:31.230
<v Speaker 1>Like they're not jealous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't get jealous.</v>

955
00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:32.273
<v Speaker 1>They don't fall in love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have sexual feelings or </v>

956
00:53:35.941 --> 00:53:39.060
<v Speaker 1>behaviors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not a cognitive creature.</v>

957
00:53:39.140 --> 00:53:39.973
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell are you going to talk to </v>

958
00:53:40.351 --> 00:53:43.250
<v Speaker 1>an aunt about how it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is it going carry him?</v>

959
00:53:43.251 --> 00:53:44.700
<v Speaker 1>That grain of sand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like an ant.</v>

960
00:53:44.701 --> 00:53:46.710
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't mean that doesn't even care </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>

961
00:53:47.070 --> 00:53:47.903
<v Speaker 1>And so it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really a profound observation </v>

962
00:53:50.551 --> 00:53:51.384
<v Speaker 1>because what it indicates is that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't even communicate with someone </v>

963
00:53:55.260 --> 00:53:58.560
<v Speaker 1>unless you were 99% the same as they </v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

964
00:53:59.190 --> 00:54:03.660
<v Speaker 1>Because to communicate with someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>means you have to share a whole massive,</v>

965
00:54:03.690 --> 00:54:05.580
<v Speaker 1>immense set of presuppositions.</v>

966
00:54:05.580 --> 00:54:07.710
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I say,</v>

967
00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:13.040
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got jealous at a party last week,</v>

968
00:54:14.670 --> 00:54:15.840
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to say,</v>

969
00:54:15.870 --> 00:54:18.690
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean jealous?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That isn't going to be your question.</v>

970
00:54:18.770 --> 00:54:19.561
<v Speaker 1>You're going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

971
00:54:19.561 --> 00:54:23.760
<v Speaker 1>what were their particular circumstances</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he elicited that response?</v>

972
00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:27.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to explain anger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to explain playfulness,</v>

973
00:54:27.841 --> 00:54:28.840
<v Speaker 1>hunger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

974
00:54:28.841 --> 00:54:31.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the basic human motivations that you</v>

975
00:54:31.081 --> 00:54:31.914
<v Speaker 1>see displayed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say the typical adventure movie or </v>

976
00:54:33.601 --> 00:54:34.434
<v Speaker 1>romantic comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like those don't need explanation </v>

977
00:54:36.691 --> 00:54:37.524
<v Speaker 1>because we're the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's that sameness that constitutes </v>

978
00:54:41.850 --> 00:54:44.430
<v Speaker 1>the essence of the collective </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious.</v>

979
00:54:44.431 --> 00:54:49.431
<v Speaker 1>Now his hypothesis was that you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>only biologically structured,</v>

980
00:54:51.930 --> 00:54:54.480
<v Speaker 1>you know in terms of your morphology of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your physiology,</v>

981
00:54:54.481 --> 00:54:56.970
<v Speaker 1>but that that extends right up into your</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain structure.</v>

982
00:54:56.971 --> 00:54:59.370
<v Speaker 1>And even above that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the contents.</v>

983
00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:00.233
<v Speaker 1>Either the contents of your psyche or at</v>
<v Speaker 1>least into the way that your psyche </v>

984
00:55:04.891 --> 00:55:06.780
<v Speaker 1>becomes organized across time.</v>

985
00:55:07.140 --> 00:55:08.850
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems,</v>

986
00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:10.013
<v Speaker 1>it seems like a hypothesis that's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>bloody obvious that you can't believe </v>

987
00:55:13.081 --> 00:55:15.240
<v Speaker 1>that people would have disputed it for </v>
<v Speaker 1>so long.</v>

988
00:55:15.241 --> 00:55:16.074
<v Speaker 1>But experimental psychologists were very</v>
<v Speaker 1>strongly influenced by behaviorists and </v>

989
00:55:21.421 --> 00:55:22.254
<v Speaker 1>the behaviorist assumed partly for </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideological reasons and partly for the </v>

990
00:55:26.371 --> 00:55:31.371
<v Speaker 1>sake of scientific simplicity that human</v>
<v Speaker 1>beings were blank slates and that all we</v>

991
00:55:32.161 --> 00:55:34.740
<v Speaker 1>were was what we learned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

992
00:55:34.741 --> 00:55:39.120
<v Speaker 1>there's a book out now called human </v>
<v Speaker 1>universals.</v>

993
00:55:39.340 --> 00:55:40.173
<v Speaker 1>I'm unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember the name of the author </v>

994
00:55:42.181 --> 00:55:43.590
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a book.</v>

995
00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:44.453
<v Speaker 1>It's a work of sociology slash slash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anthropology and this person has </v>

996
00:55:48.511 --> 00:55:51.080
<v Speaker 1>collected human commonality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's the,</v>

997
00:55:51.090 --> 00:55:53.190
<v Speaker 1>what's the same about people everywhere?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

998
00:55:53.191 --> 00:55:57.150
<v Speaker 1>we pretty much all wear clothes </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes for protective purposes,</v>

999
00:55:57.450 --> 00:56:00.870
<v Speaker 1>but if not generally for at least for </v>
<v Speaker 1>ceremonial purposes,</v>

1000
00:56:01.110 --> 00:56:04.050
<v Speaker 1>there's pair bonding in societies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People Fall in love.</v>

1001
00:56:04.170 --> 00:56:07.110
<v Speaker 1>The basic emotions are the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We use fire.</v>

1002
00:56:07.260 --> 00:56:09.090
<v Speaker 1>That's a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1003
00:56:09.300 --> 00:56:11.280
<v Speaker 1>cause no other animal can manage that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

1004
00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:16.260
<v Speaker 1>there's literally dozens and dozens of </v>
<v Speaker 1>universal commonalities across people.</v>

1005
00:56:16.261 --> 00:56:20.220
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of the substructure of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the collective unconscious.</v>

1006
00:56:20.610 --> 00:56:24.400
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back the creative idea.</v>

1007
00:56:24.730 --> 00:56:25.563
<v Speaker 1>Well partly your creative act is going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be a consequence of your attempts to </v>

1008
00:56:30.371 --> 00:56:31.204
<v Speaker 1>integrate the peculiarities of your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience with the peculiarities of </v>

1009
00:56:36.611 --> 00:56:40.000
<v Speaker 1>your culture and the spirit and did more</v>
<v Speaker 1>general</v>

1010
00:56:41.590 --> 00:56:45.310
<v Speaker 1>phenomena states of being that you share</v>
<v Speaker 1>it with other people.</v>

1011
00:56:45.670 --> 00:56:50.020
<v Speaker 1>So because you come into the world and </v>
<v Speaker 1>have your own viewpoint,</v>

1012
00:56:50.350 --> 00:56:51.183
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have access to information that no </v>

1013
00:56:52.991 --> 00:56:53.824
<v Speaker 1>other person has access to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so to some degree that can be the </v>

1014
00:56:56.981 --> 00:56:59.890
<v Speaker 1>basis of your creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just that information.</v>

1015
00:57:00.580 --> 00:57:04.600
<v Speaker 1>But then in order to communicate it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is also part of being creative,</v>

1016
00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:05.500
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause he,</v>

1017
00:57:05.500 --> 00:57:06.333
<v Speaker 1>you can't just be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're creative but no one can </v>

1018
00:57:07.721 --> 00:57:08.590
<v Speaker 1>understand you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

1019
00:57:08.591 --> 00:57:11.290
<v Speaker 1>it's more like your schizophrenia then </v>
<v Speaker 1>like your creative,</v>

1020
00:57:11.291 --> 00:57:12.124
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have loose associations and so </v>

1021
00:57:13.601 --> 00:57:14.434
<v Speaker 1>forth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you cannot put together a coherent </v>

1022
00:57:15.431 --> 00:57:16.264
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you have to take that unique </v>

1023
00:57:17.711 --> 00:57:21.400
<v Speaker 1>information and integrate it with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural knowledge,</v>

1024
00:57:21.401 --> 00:57:25.180
<v Speaker 1>your cultural narratives and grounded in</v>
<v Speaker 1>universal human biology.</v>

1025
00:57:25.181 --> 00:57:27.550
<v Speaker 1>And then you can present that as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>creative act.</v>

1026
00:57:28.100 --> 00:57:28.933
<v Speaker 3>Now</v>

1027
00:57:30.900 --> 00:57:34.710
<v Speaker 1>that's one possible place for the origin</v>
<v Speaker 1>of new ideas.</v>

1028
00:57:34.711 --> 00:57:35.700
<v Speaker 1>But here's another,</v>

1029
00:57:36.690 --> 00:57:37.523
<v Speaker 3>so</v>

1030
00:57:38.450 --> 00:57:39.283
<v Speaker 1>remember we talked about Piaget and </v>
<v Speaker 1>piaget basically said that to begin to </v>

1031
00:57:43.341 --> 00:57:44.174
<v Speaker 1>understand something you acted out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you represent the world with your </v>

1032
00:57:47.541 --> 00:57:48.374
<v Speaker 1>body by sitting on a chair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you represent the chair with your body </v>

1033
00:57:51.500 --> 00:57:52.333
<v Speaker 1>by walking through a doorway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you represent the doorway with your </v>

1034
00:57:54.201 --> 00:57:56.240
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By grabbing a glass,</v>

1035
00:57:56.241 --> 00:57:58.430
<v Speaker 1>you do the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're matching,</v>

1036
00:57:58.550 --> 00:57:59.383
<v Speaker 1>you're imitating the world all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're mapping it onto your </v>

1037
00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:04.700
<v Speaker 1>physiological structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So okay,</v>

1038
00:58:04.701 --> 00:58:08.900
<v Speaker 1>so that you get a sense that would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of what understanding means,</v>

1039
00:58:09.540 --> 00:58:11.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause that's a complex term to sort of,</v>

1040
00:58:11.630 --> 00:58:14.060
<v Speaker 1>to understand what does it mean to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand something.</v>

1041
00:58:14.260 --> 00:58:16.620
<v Speaker 1>It means to get a grip on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1042
00:58:16.810 --> 00:58:18.920
<v Speaker 1>we use those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those terms for a reason.</v>

1043
00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:20.390
<v Speaker 1>It's to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1044
00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:23.300
<v Speaker 1>you're standing firmly in relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>to it.</v>

1045
00:58:23.690 --> 00:58:25.880
<v Speaker 1>You can handle it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of those things.</v>

1046
00:58:26.420 --> 00:58:29.780
<v Speaker 1>So that's one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the beginning.</v>

1047
00:58:29.781 --> 00:58:33.500
<v Speaker 1>But then also you're capable of </v>
<v Speaker 1>imitating so you can imitate yourself,</v>

1048
00:58:34.010 --> 00:58:37.760
<v Speaker 1>which is what you do when you repeat </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences that had a positive outcome.</v>

1049
00:58:38.060 --> 00:58:40.880
<v Speaker 1>But you can also imitate other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then you think,</v>

1050
00:58:40.881 --> 00:58:43.160
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well who are those people imitating?</v>

1051
00:58:44.030 --> 00:58:44.863
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer to that is it's like we're </v>

1052
00:58:47.090 --> 00:58:52.090
<v Speaker 1>led screens and we're constantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>rippling imitations of imitations,</v>

1053
00:58:54.501 --> 00:58:55.334
<v Speaker 1>of imitations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of invitations across our physiological </v>

1054
00:58:59.330 --> 00:59:00.163
<v Speaker 1>landscape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you guys are the sum total of a </v>

1055
00:59:02.961 --> 00:59:03.794
<v Speaker 1>very long evolutionary process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're also the sum total of an </v>

1056
00:59:06.621 --> 00:59:11.621
<v Speaker 1>incredibly long process of mimicry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what you mimic is your culture.</v>

1057
00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:15.560
<v Speaker 1>So you can think of your culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something with the personality,</v>

1058
00:59:15.561 --> 00:59:16.394
<v Speaker 1>it's complex personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's the personality of your </v>

1059
00:59:18.621 --> 00:59:22.670
<v Speaker 1>ancestors that perfectly reasonable way </v>
<v Speaker 1>of looking at and you imitate that.</v>

1060
00:59:23.250 --> 00:59:24.083
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why we call our our laws of body </v>

1061
00:59:27.291 --> 00:59:28.220
<v Speaker 1>of laws.</v>

1062
00:59:28.490 --> 00:59:31.820
<v Speaker 1>And you could say that the legal system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially with English common law,</v>

1063
00:59:32.030 --> 00:59:32.863
<v Speaker 1>is the articulate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>articulated representation of the </v>

1064
00:59:36.351 --> 00:59:39.530
<v Speaker 1>imitative customs and rituals of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire society.</v>

1065
00:59:39.770 --> 00:59:42.050
<v Speaker 1>It's been brought right up into full </v>
<v Speaker 1>articulation,</v>

1066
00:59:42.290 --> 00:59:47.290
<v Speaker 1>but it was there to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So part of where you draw your,</v>

1067
00:59:49.550 --> 00:59:54.440
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your material for creativity is that you</v>

1068
00:59:54.441 --> 00:59:55.274
<v Speaker 1>observe the behaviors and interactions </v>
<v Speaker 1>of all people who've been imitating all </v>

1069
00:59:58.641 --> 01:00:02.930
<v Speaker 1>people since the beginning of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's unbelievably informative.</v>

1070
01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:05.780
<v Speaker 1>It's way more informative than you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever represent.</v>

1071
01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:06.793
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much information someone can </v>

1072
01:00:08.690 --> 01:00:11.540
<v Speaker 1>indicate with just lifting your eyebrow </v>
<v Speaker 1>a quarter of an inch,</v>

1073
01:00:11.541 --> 01:00:12.950
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That can indicate irony.</v>

1074
01:00:12.951 --> 01:00:13.784
<v Speaker 1>Anik can indicate the relationship of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>joke to another set of jokes that that </v>

1075
01:00:16.491 --> 01:00:19.730
<v Speaker 1>person knows that you and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very complicated.</v>

1076
01:00:19.731 --> 01:00:22.250
<v Speaker 1>You can't articulate all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in some sense,</v>

1077
01:00:22.251 --> 01:00:23.270
<v Speaker 1>you know it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1078
01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:25.220
<v Speaker 1>You're a player in that game.</v>

1079
01:00:25.850 --> 01:00:26.840
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now and then,</v>

1080
01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:28.160
<v Speaker 1>so then imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1081
01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:29.053
<v Speaker 1>you've got all that embodied to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree that you're a sophisticated </v>

1082
01:00:31.851 --> 01:00:32.684
<v Speaker 1>player,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then your imagination is representing </v>

1083
01:00:34.791 --> 01:00:39.050
<v Speaker 1>you and it's representing the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's an abstraction,</v>

1084
01:00:39.051 --> 01:00:39.884
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because your imagination is not the </v>

1085
01:00:40.941 --> 01:00:43.310
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a representation of the world.</v>

1086
01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:47.180
<v Speaker 1>And then what you can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that means in the imagination,</v>

1087
01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:51.080
<v Speaker 1>there's all sorts of information that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the imitative behavior.</v>

1088
01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:54.830
<v Speaker 1>And then Ben,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can talk about the image.</v>

1089
01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:57.140
<v Speaker 1>That's sort of what you do when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpret a dream.</v>

1090
01:00:57.530 --> 01:00:58.363
<v Speaker 1>So what's your dream doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your imagination is watching you wander </v>

1091
01:01:01.251 --> 01:01:02.084
<v Speaker 1>around in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know when you have your category </v>

1092
01:01:03.981 --> 01:01:04.814
<v Speaker 1>systems and your theories and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then the dream puts forth what </v>

1093
01:01:08.901 --> 01:01:09.734
<v Speaker 1>that like an image,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an image representation of what that </v>

1094
01:01:13.461 --> 01:01:14.294
<v Speaker 1>might signify.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's in this weird language which </v>

1095
01:01:16.251 --> 01:01:18.860
<v Speaker 1>has an image,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an image laden language.</v>

1096
01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:21.830
<v Speaker 1>It can be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can range from completely incoherent,</v>

1097
01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:26.360
<v Speaker 1>just juxtaposed images to unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex and sophisticated,</v>

1098
01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:27.433
<v Speaker 1>full develop narratives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of the process by which </v>

1099
01:01:31.070 --> 01:01:31.903
<v Speaker 1>the information that's embedded in you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the culture at a behavioral level </v>

1100
01:01:35.570 --> 01:01:39.650
<v Speaker 1>moves up to the imagination and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>pops up into articulated space.</v>

1101
01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:42.110
<v Speaker 1>So you have a dream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dream is about you.</v>

1102
01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:44.930
<v Speaker 1>And then you talk about the dream and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing.</v>

1103
01:01:44.931 --> 01:01:49.460
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to translate the images </v>
<v Speaker 1>into articulated representations.</v>

1104
01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:50.413
<v Speaker 1>And that's also a good way of thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about how memory moves from the bottom </v>

1105
01:01:53.721 --> 01:01:56.120
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's interesting,</v>

1106
01:01:56.750 --> 01:01:58.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1107
01:01:58.271 --> 01:02:01.520
<v Speaker 1>when sometimes you have a realization or</v>
<v Speaker 1>a moment of insight,</v>

1108
01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:03.013
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that there's a feeling that goes </v>

1109
01:02:03.681 --> 01:02:05.420
<v Speaker 1>along with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a charge.</v>

1110
01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:08.210
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's a charge that you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

1111
01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:09.253
<v Speaker 1>from simplifying something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also from experiencing the new </v>

1112
01:02:11.991 --> 01:02:15.320
<v Speaker 1>possibilities that emerge as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of that realization.</v>

1113
01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:20.490
<v Speaker 1>What seems to happen is that you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>the behavioral realm,</v>

1114
01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:23.380
<v Speaker 1>let's say the things you act out and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things you imitate.</v>

1115
01:02:23.381 --> 01:02:24.870
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very complex.</v>

1116
01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:28.140
<v Speaker 1>And then on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have the image of that,</v>

1117
01:02:28.290 --> 01:02:29.123
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're trying to get the image </v>

1118
01:02:29.821 --> 01:02:30.654
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's really hard because this </v>

1119
01:02:31.321 --> 01:02:34.980
<v Speaker 1>changes and this floats around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're trying to get those lined up.</v>

1120
01:02:34.981 --> 01:02:35.814
<v Speaker 1>And then on top of that you're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get your articulated representations </v>

1121
01:02:38.161 --> 01:02:42.060
<v Speaker 1>lined up so that you can say what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know about who you are.</v>

1122
01:02:42.690 --> 01:02:44.310
<v Speaker 1>And when all those come together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

1123
01:02:44.311 --> 01:02:45.750
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got my act together.</v>

1124
01:02:45.751 --> 01:02:48.030
<v Speaker 1>But now and then you'll have an insight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1125
01:02:48.031 --> 01:02:49.920
<v Speaker 1>you'll think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well like this woman who,</v>

1126
01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:52.470
<v Speaker 1>who I told you about who had be </v>
<v Speaker 1>molested,</v>

1127
01:02:52.710 --> 01:02:54.360
<v Speaker 1>the insight was while I was a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>kid,</v>

1128
01:02:54.361 --> 01:02:56.790
<v Speaker 1>but so was my brother Bang.</v>

1129
01:02:56.790 --> 01:02:57.623
<v Speaker 1>It's like wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of things that didn't make </v>

1130
01:02:59.881 --> 01:03:02.070
<v Speaker 1>sense anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just fall into place.</v>

1131
01:03:02.130 --> 01:03:06.360
<v Speaker 1>You get this articulated representation </v>
<v Speaker 1>that can sum up a whole bunch of,</v>

1132
01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:11.580
<v Speaker 1>what would you call them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>divergent and apparently unrelated image</v>

1133
01:03:11.581 --> 01:03:12.414
<v Speaker 1>representations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then all of a sudden your path </v>

1134
01:03:14.281 --> 01:03:15.114
<v Speaker 1>forward is clearer because you know more</v>
<v Speaker 1>about who you are and you know more </v>

1135
01:03:17.671 --> 01:03:20.340
<v Speaker 1>about how you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you're going.</v>

1136
01:03:21.030 --> 01:03:24.150
<v Speaker 1>So that is in large part what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening in psychoanalysis.</v>

1137
01:03:24.151 --> 01:03:26.280
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly what happens with dream </v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis,</v>

1138
01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:28.350
<v Speaker 1>which is something that Freud also </v>
<v Speaker 1>pioneered.</v>

1139
01:03:29.010 --> 01:03:32.910
<v Speaker 1>No Freud believed that dreams were </v>
<v Speaker 1>wished fulfillments and you know,</v>

1140
01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:38.910
<v Speaker 1>and he believed that the function of </v>
<v Speaker 1>dreams about wish fulfillment,</v>

1141
01:03:38.911 --> 01:03:40.920
<v Speaker 1>where to protect sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

1142
01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:42.113
<v Speaker 1>navy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're really thirsty and you go to </v>

1143
01:03:44.551 --> 01:03:47.430
<v Speaker 1>sleep and you dream about drinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>

1144
01:03:47.550 --> 01:03:51.210
<v Speaker 1>Some of you who have consumed too much </v>
<v Speaker 1>beer the night before,</v>

1145
01:03:51.211 --> 01:03:53.250
<v Speaker 1>it might be familiar with those sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>dreams.</v>

1146
01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:54.533
<v Speaker 1>And so you're dreaming that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>searching out fountains and you're </v>

1147
01:03:57.301 --> 01:04:01.950
<v Speaker 1>drinking and Freud's interpretation that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be,</v>

1148
01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:05.460
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should stay asleep.</v>

1149
01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:10.650
<v Speaker 1>And so the dream is providing your </v>
<v Speaker 1>underlying,</v>

1150
01:04:11.250 --> 01:04:12.083
<v Speaker 1>interrelated motivational systems say </v>
<v Speaker 1>the one that governs thirst with the </v>

1151
01:04:15.421 --> 01:04:18.960
<v Speaker 1>fulfillment of its desire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think that's,</v>

1152
01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:19.853
<v Speaker 1>I really think that's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it's weird because dreams of </v>

1153
01:04:22.261 --> 01:04:24.120
<v Speaker 1>course could be doing all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

1154
01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:29.660
<v Speaker 1>but what seems to happen instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I realized this most particularly once I</v>

1155
01:04:30.241 --> 01:04:31.074
<v Speaker 1>heard about a study about the effects of</v>
<v Speaker 1>testosterone cycling testosterone on </v>

1156
01:04:36.001 --> 01:04:39.060
<v Speaker 1>female sexual activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the plan is this,</v>

1157
01:04:39.061 --> 01:04:39.894
<v Speaker 1>is that in women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>testosterone levels vary across the </v>

1158
01:04:42.631 --> 01:04:45.950
<v Speaker 1>monthly cycle and so does sexual desire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

1159
01:04:47.490 --> 01:04:49.560
<v Speaker 1>what seems to happen is that as </v>
<v Speaker 1>testosterone,</v>

1160
01:04:49.710 --> 01:04:50.543
<v Speaker 1>testosterone increases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the frequency of sexual acts doesn't </v>

1161
01:04:54.901 --> 01:04:55.734
<v Speaker 1>necessarily increase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the frequency of sexual fantasy </v>

1162
01:04:58.801 --> 01:04:59.634
<v Speaker 1>increases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the f the hormone is driving the </v>

1163
01:05:01.981 --> 01:05:05.070
<v Speaker 1>fantasies and then the fantasies drive </v>
<v Speaker 1>the behavior.</v>

1164
01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:05.933
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the dream isn't fulfilling a </v>

1165
01:05:09.331 --> 01:05:10.164
<v Speaker 1>wish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What it's doing is that's how the </v>

1166
01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:16.680
<v Speaker 1>motivational system manifests itself in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a plan for action.</v>

1167
01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:17.681
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1168
01:05:17.681 --> 01:05:18.514
<v Speaker 1>you could be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should be going to look for sources </v>

1169
01:05:19.871 --> 01:05:23.260
<v Speaker 1>of water if you're thirsty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so because of the,</v>

1170
01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:24.333
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your hypothalamus has to communicate </v>

1171
01:05:25.541 --> 01:05:26.374
<v Speaker 1>with you somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't just grip your behavior and </v>

1172
01:05:28.601 --> 01:05:30.910
<v Speaker 1>move you around like a robot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1173
01:05:30.911 --> 01:05:35.320
<v Speaker 1>it has to indicate what the state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what your state is.</v>

1174
01:05:35.321 --> 01:05:36.154
<v Speaker 1>It does that all sorts of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then start tilting you towards a </v>

1175
01:05:39.251 --> 01:05:40.084
<v Speaker 1>solution using your memories and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>skills and everything that would be </v>

1176
01:05:42.401 --> 01:05:45.310
<v Speaker 1>related to successful outcomes of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>form,</v>

1177
01:05:46.060 --> 01:05:46.893
<v Speaker 1>that form in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing I should say about </v>

1178
01:05:49.991 --> 01:05:50.824
<v Speaker 1>creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is I think something very </v>

1179
01:05:52.241 --> 01:05:55.890
<v Speaker 1>useful for understanding people's </v>
<v Speaker 1>reactions to psychoanalysis.</v>

1180
01:05:56.680 --> 01:06:00.760
<v Speaker 1>I have a lot of creative people in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>clientele for a variety of reasons.</v>

1181
01:06:00.910 --> 01:06:01.743
<v Speaker 1>And some who aren't creative and </v>
<v Speaker 1>creativity is a trade and most people </v>

1182
01:06:05.711 --> 01:06:07.960
<v Speaker 1>aren't creative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not common.</v>

1183
01:06:08.590 --> 01:06:09.423
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and some people who are creative are so </v>

1184
01:06:10.841 --> 01:06:11.674
<v Speaker 1>creative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just absolutely beyond </v>

1185
01:06:13.091 --> 01:06:14.230
<v Speaker 1>comprehension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1186
01:06:14.730 --> 01:06:17.230
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Picasso for example,</v>

1187
01:06:17.410 --> 01:06:22.410
<v Speaker 1>created 65,000 works of art three a day </v>
<v Speaker 1>for 65 years now that guy was created.</v>

1188
01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:26.553
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of people aren't creative and </v>

1189
01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:32.290
<v Speaker 1>they're not interested in psychoanalytic</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>

1190
01:06:32.300 --> 01:06:34.030
<v Speaker 1>They're not interested in architectural </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>

1191
01:06:34.031 --> 01:06:34.864
<v Speaker 1>They're not really gripped by narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you happen to be one marker for </v>

1192
01:06:37.871 --> 01:06:38.980
<v Speaker 1>creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

1193
01:06:38.981 --> 01:06:42.670
<v Speaker 1>for openness is I'm really liking </v>
<v Speaker 1>fiction.</v>

1194
01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:44.553
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and women actually like fiction more </v>

1195
01:06:46.091 --> 01:06:49.990
<v Speaker 1>than men and because women are actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>slightly higher and part of openness,</v>

1196
01:06:49.991 --> 01:06:52.690
<v Speaker 1>the men are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what else?</v>

1197
01:06:52.691 --> 01:06:54.490
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you like poetry,</v>

1198
01:06:54.700 --> 01:06:56.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it gives you an aesthetic,</v>

1199
01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:57.513
<v Speaker 1>an aesthetic experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you really get deeply involved in </v>

1200
01:06:59.741 --> 01:07:00.574
<v Speaker 1>music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're able to produce things that </v>

1201
01:07:02.591 --> 01:07:03.424
<v Speaker 1>are created.</v>

1202
01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:07.690
<v Speaker 1>So if you have the kind of mine that </v>
<v Speaker 1>works in association.</v>

1203
01:07:07.700 --> 01:07:09.900
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I told you guys up,</v>

1204
01:07:10.330 --> 01:07:11.163
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>write down as many words as you can in </v>

1205
01:07:13.271 --> 01:07:15.490
<v Speaker 1>the next three minutes that begin with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the letter l.</v>

1206
01:07:16.420 --> 01:07:19.390
<v Speaker 1>Those of you who are more creative would</v>
<v Speaker 1>come up with more words.</v>

1207
01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:22.480
<v Speaker 1>So there's a verbal fluency component,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could say.</v>

1208
01:07:22.750 --> 01:07:24.370
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1209
01:07:24.460 --> 01:07:26.620
<v Speaker 1>how many uses can you think of for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>break?</v>

1210
01:07:27.220 --> 01:07:28.053
<v Speaker 1>And then I would score that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first would be how many uses you </v>

1211
01:07:30.461 --> 01:07:31.294
<v Speaker 1>came up with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be the sheer number I'd throw </v>

1212
01:07:32.861 --> 01:07:35.410
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The stupid ones that make no sense.</v>

1213
01:07:35.590 --> 01:07:38.180
<v Speaker 1>And often you have to get a panel of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people to,</v>

1214
01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:40.420
<v Speaker 1>to make that judgment strike you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1215
01:07:40.421 --> 01:07:42.760
<v Speaker 1>you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's a thing.</v>

1216
01:07:42.790 --> 01:07:45.220
<v Speaker 1>You could use it as a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like no x,</v>

1217
01:07:45.221 --> 01:07:47.020
<v Speaker 1>you don't get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't get a score for that.</v>

1218
01:07:47.380 --> 01:07:48.213
<v Speaker 1>So then you get another score for how </v>
<v Speaker 1>uncommon your response was because </v>

1219
01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:55.113
<v Speaker 1>that's an originality dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And actually if you calculate those two </v>

1220
01:07:57.521 --> 01:08:01.900
<v Speaker 1>dimensions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fluency and originality from a divergent</v>

1221
01:08:01.901 --> 01:08:04.480
<v Speaker 1>thinking tasks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the one I just told you about,</v>

1222
01:08:04.570 --> 01:08:08.110
<v Speaker 1>you can predict how creative people </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't quite well anyways.</v>

1223
01:08:08.530 --> 01:08:09.363
<v Speaker 1>The really creative people seem to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>a deep wellspring of unconscious ideas </v>

1224
01:08:13.031 --> 01:08:13.864
<v Speaker 1>that are always flowing forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some of those people dream like mad </v>

1225
01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:20.930
<v Speaker 1>and they have extremely sophisticated </v>
<v Speaker 1>and complex dreams and those dreams seem</v>

1226
01:08:20.931 --> 01:08:23.510
<v Speaker 1>to guide their behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1227
01:08:23.730 --> 01:08:24.563
<v Speaker 1>and that's quite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's quite entertaining when you see </v>

1228
01:08:26.691 --> 01:08:27.524
<v Speaker 1>that in psychotherapy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have an interest in such things </v>

1229
01:08:29.451 --> 01:08:30.560
<v Speaker 1>and you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1230
01:08:30.561 --> 01:08:33.800
<v Speaker 1>how do you know if your dream </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretation is true?</v>

1231
01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:35.600
<v Speaker 1>And that's for that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1232
01:08:35.601 --> 01:08:36.434
<v Speaker 1>how do you know how you interpreted?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The last book you read is true and </v>

1233
01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:40.940
<v Speaker 1>that's you.</v>

1234
01:08:40.940 --> 01:08:41.773
<v Speaker 1>That is you don't know how you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even if you did and you don't know </v>

1235
01:08:45.561 --> 01:08:47.180
<v Speaker 1>how you know it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1236
01:08:47.181 --> 01:08:48.014
<v Speaker 1>Because lots of people can read a book </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they come away with slightly </v>

1237
01:08:49.911 --> 01:08:50.744
<v Speaker 1>different interpretations of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's because did imagine that the </v>

1238
01:08:53.541 --> 01:08:58.541
<v Speaker 1>book is a multilevel pattern and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>the reader is a multilevel pattern.</v>

1239
01:08:59.090 --> 01:09:03.140
<v Speaker 1>And then if you put those two together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a multilevel pattern that's made</v>

1240
01:09:03.141 --> 01:09:03.974
<v Speaker 1>out of the reader end of the book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's going to be unique for every </v>

1241
01:09:06.411 --> 01:09:07.244
<v Speaker 1>single reader except that we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>commonalities of structure and so that </v>

1242
01:09:10.581 --> 01:09:14.990
<v Speaker 1>we can communicate about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you read a book and it strikes you,</v>

1243
01:09:14.991 --> 01:09:17.270
<v Speaker 1>certain things strike you and certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>things seem right.</v>

1244
01:09:17.271 --> 01:09:20.720
<v Speaker 1>If you do a dream interpretation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a collaboration between you and the</v>

1245
01:09:20.721 --> 01:09:24.110
<v Speaker 1>client about the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the interpretation.</v>

1246
01:09:24.111 --> 01:09:27.350
<v Speaker 1>So usually what I do is I have people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1247
01:09:27.351 --> 01:09:30.140
<v Speaker 1>they'll tell me their dream from </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning to end.</v>

1248
01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:31.393
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud would say already you're </v>

1249
01:09:33.201 --> 01:09:36.170
<v Speaker 1>introducing all sorts of bias because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not telling you the dream.</v>

1250
01:09:36.171 --> 01:09:39.960
<v Speaker 1>They're telling you the dream as they </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpret and remember it.</v>

1251
01:09:40.190 --> 01:09:40.761
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1252
01:09:40.761 --> 01:09:41.960
<v Speaker 1>that's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1253
01:09:41.961 --> 01:09:43.370
<v Speaker 1>but you do what you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1254
01:09:43.550 --> 01:09:44.383
<v Speaker 1>and I tell people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just write it down as fast as you can </v>

1255
01:09:46.311 --> 01:09:47.144
<v Speaker 1>and try not to think about it too much </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we don't want post dream </v>

1256
01:09:49.671 --> 01:09:50.504
<v Speaker 1>editing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then I'll listen to it and then then </v>

1257
01:09:54.621 --> 01:09:55.454
<v Speaker 1>they'll tell it to me again slowly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I'll listen to a sentence and </v>

1258
01:09:58.251 --> 01:10:01.610
<v Speaker 1>I'll let my associational network work </v>
<v Speaker 1>on it and see if,</v>

1259
01:10:01.670 --> 01:10:02.503
<v Speaker 1>see what that reminds me of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I'll ask the person what it </v>

1260
01:10:05.241 --> 01:10:07.520
<v Speaker 1>reminds them of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we'll talk about these.</v>

1261
01:10:07.550 --> 01:10:11.030
<v Speaker 1>Those are the direct associations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those are the things Freud would call</v>

1262
01:10:11.031 --> 01:10:12.800
<v Speaker 1>free associations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you could say,</v>

1263
01:10:13.130 --> 01:10:16.220
<v Speaker 1>well around every utterance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a sentence,</v>

1264
01:10:16.460 --> 01:10:18.740
<v Speaker 1>there's a collection of potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>meanings,</v>

1265
01:10:18.741 --> 01:10:19.310
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1266
01:10:19.310 --> 01:10:21.530
<v Speaker 1>And those meetings might be direct </v>
<v Speaker 1>meanings,</v>

1267
01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:25.610
<v Speaker 1>like really tightly associated with it </v>
<v Speaker 1>to sort of loose meanings.</v>

1268
01:10:25.910 --> 01:10:26.743
<v Speaker 1>And so you can hit it back and forth </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the client and therapist until you </v>

1269
01:10:30.471 --> 01:10:31.041
<v Speaker 1>faint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1270
01:10:31.041 --> 01:10:32.360
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems to be,</v>

1271
01:10:32.630 --> 01:10:33.463
<v Speaker 1>that seems to be where that's going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're also thinking about it and </v>

1272
01:10:35.441 --> 01:10:36.274
<v Speaker 1>relationship to the person's current </v>
<v Speaker 1>life experiences and the rest of the </v>

1273
01:10:39.231 --> 01:10:41.870
<v Speaker 1>dream and maybe all the dreams they told</v>
<v Speaker 1>you about before.</v>

1274
01:10:41.871 --> 01:10:45.950
<v Speaker 1>So it's insanely complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's what people do when they listen</v>

1275
01:10:45.951 --> 01:10:48.140
<v Speaker 1>to a conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1276
01:10:48.230 --> 01:10:50.450
<v Speaker 1>how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you know your interpretation of a</v>

1277
01:10:50.451 --> 01:10:53.120
<v Speaker 1>conversation is true?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1278
01:10:55.310 --> 01:10:56.143
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a variety of ways that you can </v>

1279
01:10:57.081 --> 01:10:59.180
<v Speaker 1>approximate that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yet you don't know.</v>

1280
01:10:59.181 --> 01:11:02.030
<v Speaker 1>And there's lots of different ways of </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpreting a conversation.</v>

1281
01:11:02.150 --> 01:11:04.250
<v Speaker 1>That's why the postmodernists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1282
01:11:04.251 --> 01:11:06.890
<v Speaker 1>ended up in their little hole with </v>
<v Speaker 1>regards to literature.</v>

1283
01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:08.660
<v Speaker 1>They realize that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1284
01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:11.450
<v Speaker 1>there's no limit to the number of ways </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can interpret a book.</v>

1285
01:11:12.050 --> 01:11:13.470
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then they took the next step,</v>

1286
01:11:13.471 --> 01:11:14.304
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was that therefore it has no </v>

1287
01:11:15.391 --> 01:11:16.141
<v Speaker 1>meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1288
01:11:16.141 --> 01:11:16.531
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1289
01:11:16.531 --> 01:11:18.030
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>

1290
01:11:18.420 --> 01:11:22.280
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's very unsophisticated thinking.</v>

1291
01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:23.153
<v Speaker 1>It just means that the way the book </v>
<v Speaker 1>portrays meaning is exceedingly complex </v>

1292
01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:27.593
<v Speaker 1>and you can't describe it using normal </v>
<v Speaker 1>linear rationality doesn't mean the </v>

1293
01:11:31.741 --> 01:11:34.360
<v Speaker 1>meaning isn't there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so pathetic cetera.</v>

1294
01:11:34.610 --> 01:11:39.050
<v Speaker 1>That it's dangerous too because it means</v>
<v Speaker 1>that nothing has any meaning.</v>

1295
01:11:39.051 --> 01:11:41.520
<v Speaker 1>And you know that's the most dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 1>theory that,</v>

1296
01:11:42.030 --> 01:11:46.260
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you talked to the person about the dream</v>

1297
01:11:46.261 --> 01:11:49.080
<v Speaker 1>and the dream image and about what that </v>
<v Speaker 1>triggers off in their memory.</v>

1298
01:11:49.081 --> 01:11:53.190
<v Speaker 1>And you also watch what they say because</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes,</v>

1299
01:11:53.910 --> 01:11:55.430
<v Speaker 1>so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone,</v>

1300
01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:56.393
<v Speaker 1>this just happened recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone might be describing a dream </v>

1301
01:11:58.501 --> 01:11:59.670
<v Speaker 1>where they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1302
01:11:59.671 --> 01:12:01.920
<v Speaker 1>where they're wandering around somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they'll say,</v>

1303
01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:03.780
<v Speaker 1>and I'm taking the wrong road.</v>

1304
01:12:04.230 --> 01:12:04.771
<v Speaker 1>You Think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1305
01:12:04.771 --> 01:12:05.604
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well now we know what your dream meant </v>

1306
01:12:06.481 --> 01:12:09.720
<v Speaker 1>cause you just said it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm taking the wrong road.</v>

1307
01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:10.733
<v Speaker 1>And that's a Freudian slip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's so interesting because if you </v>

1308
01:12:12.541 --> 01:12:16.020
<v Speaker 1>listen to people tell their dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to kind of listen.</v>

1309
01:12:16.050 --> 01:12:16.883
<v Speaker 1>It's like they have two minds talking at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same time and one is describing the </v>

1310
01:12:20.731 --> 01:12:21.564
<v Speaker 1>dream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the other one is describing their </v>

1311
01:12:23.401 --> 01:12:25.530
<v Speaker 1>life and they don't even notice the </v>
<v Speaker 1>connection.</v>

1312
01:12:25.531 --> 01:12:26.970
<v Speaker 1>And you pointed out and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

1313
01:12:26.971 --> 01:12:27.810
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1314
01:12:27.811 --> 01:12:30.540
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know I said that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a Freudian slip.</v>

1315
01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:34.200
<v Speaker 1>And I think what's happening in part is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the right hemisphere,</v>

1316
01:12:34.201 --> 01:12:37.770
<v Speaker 1>which is an image accumulation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggregation system.</v>

1317
01:12:37.771 --> 01:12:42.771
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a low resolution pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Collection System uses mostly images and</v>

1318
01:12:43.381 --> 01:12:45.450
<v Speaker 1>it tries to put them together in </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningful ways,</v>

1319
01:12:45.451 --> 01:12:46.284
<v Speaker 1>but the meaning is vague and </v>
<v Speaker 1>comprehensive and then the left </v>

1320
01:12:49.651 --> 01:12:52.680
<v Speaker 1>hemisphere roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the linguistic hemisphere,</v>

1321
01:12:52.860 --> 01:12:53.693
<v Speaker 1>is trying to state what that says in </v>
<v Speaker 1>words and it's very difficult to make </v>

1322
01:12:57.601 --> 01:12:59.550
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make that transformation,</v>

1323
01:12:59.551 --> 01:13:00.384
<v Speaker 1>but that's why I dream analysis works </v>
<v Speaker 1>and part is because you're facilitating </v>

1324
01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:04.253
<v Speaker 1>the movement of the information in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>images into the articulated part of the </v>

1325
01:13:07.981 --> 01:13:08.814
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>

1326
01:13:09.020 --> 01:13:13.170
<v Speaker 1>You're moving information up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstraction hierarchy to the point where</v>

1327
01:13:13.171 --> 01:13:18.000
<v Speaker 1>it can be well utilized and that's now </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll end this with,</v>

1328
01:13:18.090 --> 01:13:18.923
<v Speaker 1>I'll end this discussion of Freud with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>description of some research that was </v>

1329
01:13:23.821 --> 01:13:24.654
<v Speaker 1>done recently by relatively recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say the last 20 years by this </v>

1330
01:13:29.551 --> 01:13:34.551
<v Speaker 1>psychologist at the University of Texas </v>
<v Speaker 1>at Austin who's name is James Pennebaker</v>

1331
01:13:36.061 --> 01:13:38.400
<v Speaker 1>and pennebaker's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a particularly smart psychologist.</v>

1332
01:13:38.850 --> 01:13:39.683
<v Speaker 1>He had this idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud had another idea that was related </v>

1333
01:13:42.301 --> 01:13:43.134
<v Speaker 1>to therapy and he thought that what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened if you came into therapy and </v>

1334
01:13:45.271 --> 01:13:49.860
<v Speaker 1>you talked about a traumatic event with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you are cured by Catharsis,</v>

1335
01:13:49.861 --> 01:13:54.240
<v Speaker 1>which meant that that trauma had to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of emotion associated with it.</v>

1336
01:13:54.241 --> 01:13:55.074
<v Speaker 1>And that was repressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was down there and kind of </v>

1337
01:13:56.341 --> 01:13:59.670
<v Speaker 1>struggling to get up and causing you all</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of stress and misery,</v>

1338
01:13:59.671 --> 01:14:00.840
<v Speaker 1>trying to hold it down.</v>

1339
01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:05.670
<v Speaker 1>And then if you could just tell someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it and like express your feelings,</v>

1340
01:14:05.850 --> 01:14:06.683
<v Speaker 1>then that would help you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Expressing your feelings does not help </v>

1341
01:14:08.851 --> 01:14:10.110
<v Speaker 1>you by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1342
01:14:10.530 --> 01:14:11.363
<v Speaker 1>but because that turns out to be wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it's wrong in an interesting </v>

1343
01:14:15.131 --> 01:14:16.600
<v Speaker 1>and useful way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause it's sort of,</v>

1344
01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:17.613
<v Speaker 1>it's almost right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So with pennebaker did was he took </v>

1345
01:14:20.171 --> 01:14:24.490
<v Speaker 1>undergraduates and he had them come into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lab and for three on three sick,</v>

1346
01:14:24.820 --> 01:14:25.653
<v Speaker 1>sick quenches days and he had them write</v>
<v Speaker 1>for 15 minutes each day about the worst </v>

1347
01:14:29.591 --> 01:14:30.424
<v Speaker 1>thing that they had ever done or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>worst thing that had ever happened to </v>

1348
01:14:32.231 --> 01:14:33.064
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Often people are traumatized by </v>

1349
01:14:34.301 --> 01:14:37.180
<v Speaker 1>something they did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not something that happened to them.</v>

1350
01:14:37.181 --> 01:14:38.014
<v Speaker 1>In fact more often cause someone watches</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves do something absolutely </v>

1351
01:14:41.051 --> 01:14:42.610
<v Speaker 1>horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they think,</v>

1352
01:14:42.850 --> 01:14:44.620
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did that.</v>

1353
01:14:44.770 --> 01:14:46.900
<v Speaker 1>Who am I?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know.</v>

1354
01:14:47.230 --> 01:14:48.100
<v Speaker 1>Then that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1355
01:14:48.101 --> 01:14:50.920
<v Speaker 1>things started coming unglued.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

1356
01:14:51.730 --> 01:14:52.563
<v Speaker 1>pennebaker had them do that and then for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next two weeks they felt pretty </v>

1357
01:14:55.001 --> 01:14:55.834
<v Speaker 1>wretched about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's interesting cause if they </v>

1358
01:14:57.551 --> 01:14:58.384
<v Speaker 1>would have only measured the result of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the intervention in a two week timespan </v>

1359
01:15:02.230 --> 01:15:03.700
<v Speaker 1>everyone wanted to said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never,</v>

1360
01:15:03.701 --> 01:15:06.820
<v Speaker 1>never write down your traumatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences cause it'll make you worse.</v>

1361
01:15:07.150 --> 01:15:07.983
<v Speaker 1>But over the next six months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened in particular was that </v>

1362
01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:14.410
<v Speaker 1>their physical health improved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They went to the doctor last,</v>

1363
01:15:14.411 --> 01:15:15.244
<v Speaker 1>they reported less illness and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because their overall level of </v>

1364
01:15:18.131 --> 01:15:21.280
<v Speaker 1>stress decreased for complex reasons </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we can talk about later.</v>

1365
01:15:21.550 --> 01:15:24.400
<v Speaker 1>But then pennebaker being and excellent </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientist,</v>

1366
01:15:24.700 --> 01:15:25.391
<v Speaker 1>he thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1367
01:15:25.391 --> 01:15:27.940
<v Speaker 1>well Catharsis works here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're expressing your,</v>

1368
01:15:28.030 --> 01:15:30.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trauma and poof you're fixed.</v>

1369
01:15:30.071 --> 01:15:32.710
<v Speaker 1>But he went back and he thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well wait a second,</v>

1370
01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:35.070
<v Speaker 1>maybe how you express it matters.</v>

1371
01:15:35.070 --> 01:15:35.903
<v Speaker 1>So we went back and he counted all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>words that were associated with emotion </v>

1372
01:15:38.890 --> 01:15:42.220
<v Speaker 1>and all the words that were associated </v>
<v Speaker 1>with understanding and cognition.</v>

1373
01:15:42.820 --> 01:15:47.430
<v Speaker 1>And what he found was two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One was the more words that you used,</v>

1374
01:15:47.431 --> 01:15:48.264
<v Speaker 1>particularly as your narrative developed</v>
<v Speaker 1>that indicated comprehension and </v>

1375
01:15:52.271 --> 01:15:55.240
<v Speaker 1>understanding the better you did over </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1376
01:15:55.750 --> 01:15:59.560
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens is not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the expressing of your emotion,</v>

1377
01:16:00.010 --> 01:16:00.843
<v Speaker 1>it's the expressing of your emotion and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then the weaving of the memory into a </v>

1378
01:16:06.070 --> 01:16:11.070
<v Speaker 1>new coherent representation from which </v>
<v Speaker 1>you derive a moral.</v>

1379
01:16:11.620 --> 01:16:15.670
<v Speaker 1>So what's the moral of a trauma?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't let it happen again.</v>

1380
01:16:16.150 --> 01:16:16.983
<v Speaker 1>That's the moral and the the threat </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems are going to be throwing that </v>

1381
01:16:20.111 --> 01:16:22.570
<v Speaker 1>thing up at you constantly until you </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure it out.</v>

1382
01:16:22.660 --> 01:16:26.020
<v Speaker 1>How did I get into this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do I avoid it in the future?</v>

1383
01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:28.780
<v Speaker 1>And it doesn't mean it's your fault,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but your anxiety systems,</v>

1384
01:16:28.781 --> 01:16:29.710
<v Speaker 1>they don't care about that.</v>

1385
01:16:30.070 --> 01:16:33.520
<v Speaker 1>They care about how you're not going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fall into the same hole.</v>

1386
01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:37.120
<v Speaker 1>And the only way to do that is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>analyze the causal pathways that lead to</v>

1387
01:16:37.121 --> 01:16:37.954
<v Speaker 1>the whole to begin with and see if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can either reconfigure your behavior in </v>

1388
01:16:41.681 --> 01:16:43.750
<v Speaker 1>your attitudes so that that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen again.</v>

1389
01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:46.750
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe you just don't go those places </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore,</v>

1390
01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:48.033
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either way and you're the trauma threat </v>

1391
01:16:52.091 --> 01:16:52.924
<v Speaker 1>systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as you come up with a </v>

1392
01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:58.030
<v Speaker 1>comprehensive representation that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in,</v>

1393
01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:00.220
<v Speaker 1>they'll leave you alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this can happen very,</v>

1394
01:17:00.221 --> 01:17:02.380
<v Speaker 1>very rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like with nightmares,</v>

1395
01:17:02.381 --> 01:17:03.214
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've cured people's nightmares in one </v>

1396
01:17:04.391 --> 01:17:05.440
<v Speaker 1>session,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no problem.</v>

1397
01:17:05.950 --> 01:17:09.060
<v Speaker 1>I asked them to bring the nightwear </v>
<v Speaker 1>mirror too,</v>

1398
01:17:09.670 --> 01:17:12.920
<v Speaker 1>opt in to their imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe someone's chasing them.</v>

1399
01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:14.120
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1400
01:17:15.110 --> 01:17:17.450
<v Speaker 1>think about them chasing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to visualize it.</v>

1401
01:17:17.451 --> 01:17:19.580
<v Speaker 1>Really visualize it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more real you make it,</v>

1402
01:17:19.581 --> 01:17:20.300
<v Speaker 1>the better.</v>

1403
01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:21.530
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're being chased.</v>

1404
01:17:21.531 --> 01:17:23.390
<v Speaker 1>How are you feeling?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm all anxious in the frame.</v>

1405
01:17:23.630 --> 01:17:26.930
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turn around and look at the thing that's</v>

1406
01:17:26.931 --> 01:17:29.210
<v Speaker 1>chasing you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they do that.</v>

1407
01:17:29.340 --> 01:17:31.610
<v Speaker 1>Then maybe they tell saying what it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever,</v>

1408
01:17:31.611 --> 01:17:33.770
<v Speaker 1>but maybe they don't even do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I say,</v>

1409
01:17:33.771 --> 01:17:34.191
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

1410
01:17:34.191 --> 01:17:35.024
<v Speaker 1>before you go to bed at night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just when you're almost falling to </v>

1411
01:17:37.311 --> 01:17:38.144
<v Speaker 1>sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in a hypnagogic state where </v>

1412
01:17:39.171 --> 01:17:41.450
<v Speaker 1>images are starting to come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You run that,</v>

1413
01:17:42.070 --> 01:17:44.030
<v Speaker 1>they run that Poof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that nightmare is gone.</v>

1414
01:17:44.570 --> 01:17:45.403
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for it is that they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>now reconfigured themselves as the </v>

1415
01:17:49.101 --> 01:17:51.590
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the thing that's being chased.</v>

1416
01:17:51.710 --> 01:17:52.543
<v Speaker 1>That's prey animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've configured themselves as the </v>

1417
01:17:54.951 --> 01:17:59.120
<v Speaker 1>thing that can turn around and face the </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that's chasing them.</v>

1418
01:17:59.630 --> 01:18:04.370
<v Speaker 1>And that's the same Motif as the dragon </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting the union archetypes,</v>

1419
01:18:04.371 --> 01:18:05.204
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Face what you're afraid of it not will </v>

1420
01:18:06.620 --> 01:18:09.440
<v Speaker 1>cure you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's really one of the fundamental</v>

1421
01:18:09.441 --> 01:18:13.350
<v Speaker 1>motifs of Freud and psychoanalysis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

1422
01:18:13.351 --> 01:18:14.184
<v Speaker 1>when you have an exam on Thursday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll post questions about sort of </v>

1423
01:18:16.851 --> 01:18:20.690
<v Speaker 1>representative questions on the exam </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I get home after this lecture,</v>

1424
01:18:20.750 --> 01:18:24.350
<v Speaker 1>probably deceiving the liquor there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The essays are,</v>

1425
01:18:24.351 --> 01:18:26.990
<v Speaker 1>that test is here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's multiple choice.</v>

1426
01:18:27.140 --> 01:18:29.780
<v Speaker 1>You'll have no problem finishing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that loan.</v>

1427
01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:32.030
<v Speaker 1>And if you've done the readings and come</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the lectures,</v>

1428
01:18:32.570 --> 01:18:36.820
<v Speaker 1>you'll probably do fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not a tricky test.</v>
