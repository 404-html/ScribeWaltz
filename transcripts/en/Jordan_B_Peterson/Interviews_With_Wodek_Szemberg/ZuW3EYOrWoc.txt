Speaker 1:          00:00          Uh, hi Jordan. Uh, and what x number of a producer with the agenda, Steve in the TVO and you are Jordan Peterson, professor of psychology at the University of Toronto. And this is our third conversation about various subjects. And this one we decided there's going to be, uh, about, about the future, the idea of it and then perhaps even the actuality, uh, the reason why, why, uh, the future is the subjects because you and I have talked much about it and let me start with my own, uh, uh, brief take on it. Um, my sense is that we are running out of future with capital apps. Uh, for about 10 years. Uh, we had, uh, uh, the um, uh, the I and access to, to the idea of future as an ever growing, ever improving a prospect for humanity and a, and we are at the point where we no longer have easy access to that belief. Um, do you agree? And if so, what do you think is responsible for it?

Speaker 2:          01:17          Well, it seems to me like it's a continuation of the process that needs to talk about in the late 18 hundreds when he described the death of God.

Speaker 1:          01:26          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:26          I mean he, by the death of God, he man really the collapse of Christianity or maybe of Judeo Christianity and the loss of the meeting structure that went along with that at the same time as he proclaimed that itchy also hypothesized or prophecy really that, that, that, that belief system would be replaced by is that vast political belief systems. He thought co I've communism particularly and, and he knew that even at that early time that many millions of people would die during the transition and meaning systems and now that we're out of the 20th century, those of collapse too mean very few people hold any brief with Utopian political views, whether they're on the right or the left. So we've also lost that. Then the question is, what's left after that and announced that seems to be, it's anybody's guess. I think we're also swamped by technological change that's occurring at such a rate that it's become impossible to predict the direction of the future.

Speaker 1:          02:34          So, but obviously when, when we talk about the future, we imagined a moral enhancement, uh, of, of the human condition. Uh, we imagined that a progress man, not only technological progress, not only economic progress, but moral progress. Um, and, uh, and the question is whether or not this was adler a, a viable

Speaker 2:          03:00          prospect. I wasn't just a watered down Christianity, uh, for the benefit of those, uh, who've lost faith niches. Primary point with the death of God was that you can't have moral improvement without a moral system because you know, people think there are things that are self evidently moral, but you know, it turns out that they're part of a much broader fabric. So yes, I would say to some degree it was, it was, uh, the remnants of water down Christianity playing itself out. And the question, I suppose to some degree is what's after that? And you know, the, the atheists, especially the radical atheists would have us believe that, you know, we could move towards a kind of rational sense of the world along with whatever rational ethic would go along with that. But I don't really believe that. I don't think there's much reason to believe that people will become more rational as the future progresses.

Speaker 2:          03:56          I mean, I think they might become more diverse. Lee Irrational. That's kind of how it looks to me. What do you mean by that? That nervously rational, he diversely irrational, splintered into their own little subgroups of meaning, I suppose. I mean, why would we assume that people would become more homogenous? Homogenous when in their, in their private, in their private beliefs. I mean, the rise of all these strange new age religions, which you know, we'll have collected any number of Dave ots seems to indicate that there's plenty of room on the irrational side and mean Islamic fundamentalism certainly hasn't managed Jenny disappearance. Maybe you could think of that as the last great hangover of the, of the Abrahamic religions. You know, that, that'll, that'll, that's under attack and will disappear too. But I don't see that people are progressing towards the kind of rationality that the atheists would like to presume as are our natural destination.

Speaker 2:          04:56          Just I just don't think people are that rational or capable of that degree of rationality. Why? What's the argument for that? Well, I think it's the incompleteness of rationality. Personally, I don't think, I don't think rationality can survive on its own. I think it's, it's like the capitalist system. It has to be embedded within a functioning government. No matter what the capitalists claim, the market isn't the bottom governmental agreements, the bottom, the ultimate container and rationality has to survive within a mythology and the rational is don't believe that. But I think that that's just because they're still protected by the mythology. They can get away with that clint rationality. Once you, once you agree on the presuppositions, then rationality can guide you to a destination. But I don't see how rationality can help you establish the presuppositions at all. What's more important? Curing cancer or stopping stopping the whale hunt? Let's, let's look at it that way. What's more important? Putting money into education or for sure, or healthcare. There's these terrible moral decisions about

Speaker 1:          06:09          which normally, normally we don't need to decide either or. I mean, normally in the course of human affairs we decide that, uh, we will throw certain amount, uh, for this, uh, goal and another amount for another goal. And, and so, and the, and the amounts might shift, might shift. It's never a question or so. So, so the question of I think, I think I would, people who are watching this might really want to understand what it is that you mean by presuppositions. Uh, that said that that needs to be embedded. Uh, before we can talk about the reason

Speaker 2:          06:51          a functioning belief system helps you figure out what things are more important than what other things. And you know, those are, those are, I suppose the 10 commandments would be an example of that. Are there things that are supposed to be established without question and you know, you might think some of them are obvious. People say that about the 10 commandments, thou shalt not kill. That's obvious. It's like, well, it turns out that that's not so obvious at all. It's obvious because it's, it's such an inherent part of our, the fabric of our society. And we assume that it's wrong, but there's been lots of societies that have been organized around the principles of the warriors societies, for example. And we're already, we're already discussing exceptions to the rule. Thou shalt not kill. I mean, that didn't that happen in Quebec this week, isn't Quebec debating?

Speaker 2:          07:44          I use Neisha bill. Uh, yes, it is. Well, so, you know, obviously even something as obvious as thou shalt not kill can be nibbled to death around the, around the margins. It's not obvious. And these, these belief systems, the Judeo Christian belief system, for example, and this again is something that needs to point it out, is it's whole cloth. You can't unravel part of it without the rest of it unraveling. So one of the precept positions is that there's a judge. That's God. Something's watching you and your ultimate response, ultimately responsible for your moral actions. That's a big precept position, you know, and that's gone.

Speaker 1:          08:31          Yes, it's gone for a significant minority. Uh, most, uh, most of the a 7 billion people, uh, like, uh, do partake of some kind of a faith. Right.

Speaker 2:          08:48          But still have the notion of the future though too. Whoa. There, you know, like there's plenty of idea of future in the developing the few times to catch up to the west.

Speaker 1:          08:58          Well, yes, but, but they're there the in some ways, but what we are, what we are discovering is that the real driver, uh, uh, of, uh, believe in future is not as not a desire for heightened morality, uh, or, or universal morality. But, uh, but the poverty and the poverty is what makes people want to improve their lot.

Speaker 2:          09:25          Great. Well, there's no doubt that the western countries in some sense, solve the problem of poverty and we still have the problem of relative poverty. I mean, but the, the, the material wealth that we have seems to be preferable to absolute poverty. And so that means that the, the drive for progress that, that drove the West is still alive and well in the developing countries. It's thriving too, because those countries are in fact lifting themselves out of poverty. Now, whether or not to us,

Speaker 1:          09:57          but they already know that, that uh, that if they will proceed along the path that we've already walked, uh, in the last a hundred, hundred 50 years, uh, they will catch up with us and with our kinds of problems and with our kinds of questions about where to go next. And so, and so here he will return to the question about, about the future. Do we, do we need I an idea about how the story ends for be able to, to live it properly?

Speaker 2:          10:36          Well, I was in New York on Friday with a group called future earths and that's, they're a group that was composed of, let me just see here, two major international science consortium's natural science and social science. And that's exactly the sort of argument or other sort of the questions they're trying to address. And the UN just produced a report on sustainable development, which is a document that is trying to address that question as well. What are we looking at? Those documents tend to stress limits to growth, at least to some degree. You know, they're, they're, they're based on the presupposition that we're running up against planetary boundaries in our search for increasing absolute wealth. And that we have to figure out a way of structuring our future so that it can be sustainable across some longterm. So the idea of sustainability, whatever that means is trying to, is, is being posed as the alternative tube, continual positive growth.

Speaker 2:          11:41          And there's, there's variants of that like sustainable development, which means continual improvement within the boundaries. So one of the things that's changed that, okay, we're starting to understand that, that yeah, we now have the technological capability to exceed the planet's carrying power carrying capacity. And we have to do something about that. No one's really sure how to translate that recognition of limitation into an ethic for action. And most of the translation you see is, um, be more environmentally sensitive, something like that. You know, keep the environment in mind when you're making your local decisions. But that's an ethic of limitation. It doesn't seem to be very compelling. It isn't exactly clear what that means as you play your future out over the shorter, medium term.

Speaker 1:          12:36          So it's interesting that you, uh, uh, this because in some ways environmentalist was long than most, uh, crucial, uh, developments, uh, and the history of ideas and, uh, and it was born out of recognition that, uh, to pursue growth, uh, uh, without any annual limitations, uh, it can be distracted, um, to, uh, to our sense of wellbeing. At the same time. One could suggest that ever mentalism was, uh, was, um, instrumental in, in, uh, uh, killing off the idea of progress. Uh, even though, uh, most people who I run into this with gladly defined themselves as progressive. Uh, do you agree that that kind of a mechanism, it was, uh, I was, uh, was, uh, responsible for demise of a progressive attitude to us history?

Speaker 2:          13:46          Yeah, I think, I think it, it, it's a very complicated question. I mean, I would say from a mythological perspective, we'd gone from worshiping the great father to starting to worship the great mother. I think the great mother being something like die out, you know, uh, the hypothetical planetary, uh, the integrated planetary system that has been positive as functional by a number of biologists. I mean, Gaya was actually named after, I think a Greek goddess. Um, when we were worshiping the great father that's more like the classical patriarchy that the feminists talk about. And you know, they would say that the patriarchy was concerned with things like domination and, and, and a mastery mastery. Yeah, exactly. And that's where the, the eye, the sub idea there is something like nature is the chaotic enemy and it's, it has to be overcome and mastered. And you know, when you reverse that you get no, it's the patriarchal military industrial complex.

Speaker 2:          14:54          That's the villain. Then Mother Nature is the soft nurturing force that stands underneath us that demands respect and thing is, is both those stories are true. And even though they lead to opposite conclusions, they're both true strangely enough. Because you know, opposite things aren't supposed to be true simultaneously, but life is paradoxical. So they often are. So the question is, well, what happens when you start to worship the great mother? You get more concerned with egalitarianism and distribution of wealth. I suppose that's part of it. And you can think of that as as a potential ethos for the future. I mean we are making progress in that direction because there are far fewer people in poverty as a percentage of the number of people that were alive then there were 20 years ago and it looks like that's going to continue. You know, it needs the, these documents that are emanating from the UN that talk about the future certainly have poverty reduction as a very high on their list of priorities as well as whatever environmental concerns are also outlined in the documents.

Speaker 2:          15:59          So the vision seems to be something like, well more attention to the conditions under which flourishing as possible. So don't destroy the ecosystems that support us but also maintain the possibility of lifting the rest of humanity out of squalor. Those two things might be mutually necessary because you know, it's people at the bottom of the socioeconomic hierarchy that are forced to do things like slash and burn agriculture and, and the burning of wood for heat and cooking. And you know, those are heavily greenhouse gas emitting processes. So, I mean I've, I've come to believe that the, the answer to the problem of the future is actually something that manifests itself more at a personal level. Um, you know, you might say, well, what should you do in order to, to make the future better? And I think those answers kind of beckoned in front of you.

Speaker 2:          17:00          What I've, what I've tried to teach my students is to try to make the quality of their immediate experience better. And because I think that that is something that has cascading properties. I mean, in our first conversation we talked about, you know, making one room in your house beautiful. Well it's, it's hard to make something beautiful and if you do it even locally, you learn something from that. And if you could make something local, beautiful and perfect, then it gives you some ideas about how to do it on a slightly larger scale. And maybe it also gives you some motivation to do that. And then if you can do it on a slightly larger scale, well then you have some idea about how you might even do it at a slightly larger scale. The guys we were down, I went down to to New York on Friday to talk about ideas of sustainable development.

Speaker 2:          17:50          And one of the things that was really stressed, the group had brought a bunch of people into act as critics of their ideas. And one of the things that was discussed continuously by the critics was the importance of producing micro projects that are designed to make things better and scale them up rather than trying to come up with a utopian vision from the top and force it down. And there's something about that that seems right to me. And, and I think it's something that people can engage in as individuals. Start a micro project to make things better around you. And you might say, well, at what scale and answer to that is whatever scale you can actually manage. You know, for some of my students that meant if they were in fractured families for example, which was frequently the case or a number one student who took on the project of buying groceries for the family and trying to organize their meal times, which turned out to be a way more difficult thing than he had envisioned.

Speaker 2:          18:52          He wrote about it as he, as he took on the responsibility, but I think our best bet off, I really do believe our best bet and and the way forward in the future is to look around in front of you in your immediate environment and to try to make it balanced and healthy. And I think the cumulative consequences of that will be that everything is balanced and healthy. One of the things we talked about at the meeting was you know the intuition of beauty because they don't think the, the, the, the apprehension of beauty is not something rational. It's, it's outside rationality. But the apprehension of beauty is something that that help can help guide us to construct environments that are maximally beneficial I think. I think that's what the sense of beauty is. Therefore,

Speaker 1:          19:41          also about the recognition of the beauty of being present here and now. Um, because, uh, in some ways a, this avoids the dilemma of, of, uh, uh, imagining that, that we need to entrust ourselves to a idealized future.

Speaker 2:          20:00          Yeah. Well I think, I think if something's beautiful, I think partly what that means is that the ideal future is embedded in it already. And that's why it's beautiful. I mean, the future is a tricky thing. And, and so are the things around us. I mean, everything around us contains what it is in the present, but it also contains the possibility of the multiple things it could be in the future. And I think that when you apprehend something that's beautiful or when you construct something that's beautiful, you're also constructing something that has the kind of future you would most want to like in it. I mean, I can give you, I can give you a brief example of that. I mean, the Europe, the Europeans spent centuries trying to make their, their cities and the buildings in the beautiful far more than we've, they've paid, paid far more attention to that than we do in the West or in North America anyways. And the consequence of that is that everyone flocks to Europe to see the old cities. There's something about those old cities that's right there. Beautiful.

Speaker 1:          21:10          And yet you have to be right. And being from, from Europe, I, uh, I obviously grew up in, in, uh, in May, in a number of cities in Europe and, uh, and every time I go back to you, I must say that I'm troubled by the fact that many of the cities are precisely that they are beautiful and nothing else. It should be done to them, uh, to enhance the beauty. They as beautiful as they as they can be in with talking about Paris, superrich Rome, uh, garth in Burke, Stockholm, uh, pick any of those cities. And then you'd be hard pressed to imagine what else needs to be done to make them better. Right? But that is in itself a problem, a problem precisely caused by the question that we are discussing here today, which is there, there the city is no longer have a need for future and, and, and if you don't have that need, then you are stuck. You are stuck and, and you are frozen. And we don't know. I don't think we know what to do with that.

Speaker 2:          22:29          Yeah. Well, I mean, I guess I understand what you're saying. I mean, some of those cities have become sort of living museums because of that. Although I guess maybe in some ways that's not such a bad destani given the number of people around the world who are going to want to travel. But there's certainly no shortage of beautification that could be done in the world's remaining cities. And I think that also speaks to environmental concerns. I mean, I read some books a while ago about Chesapeake Bay before the Europeans came and Chesapeake Bay was one of the richest natural environments, I think that ever existed on the planet. And what's striking about the writings about the original Chesapeake Bay is the description of their natural beauty. And you know, it's enough to make you weep. It's, it's enough to make you weak to realize how productive than and remarkable those ecosystems once were. And I mean, to me, the fact that those, those places are gone increasingly gone is reflected most particularly in a decrease in the beauty of the world. And that's I think a direction for the future. What kind of world do we want? Well, it would be lovely to have a world that you know, is unimaginably beautiful and that's something that people could work towards and you can do that locally and it,

Speaker 1:          23:50          but in some way sustainability has become persaya precisely the response to the idea of progress that, that there's no longer a question of, of how to eh change and, and create a database says never just before, but precisely to be able to, um, uh, retained and protect the threat.

Speaker 2:          24:17          Great. I think that the idea of sustainability, I think it's gone. This is something that came up in the discussions in New York too, is that sustainability is, it's kind of a vow shall not ethic. It's, you know, human beings have raped and pillaged long enough and it's time for us to start limiting our appetites so that you know, other things beside us, which also have rights can flourish. It's like, no, that isn't, that isn't what I mean, that isn't what I'm talking about. And the reason I, the reason for that is I think that's, I think that that's built on a fundamentally antihistamine. MMM, okay. Okay. An anti human mythology. I mean, it's sort of like the state of being before Noah's flood. You know, human beings are evil and sinful and we're running around making too much noise and the best thing to happen would be that nature could come back and wash us all the way with the flood. So we should be careful and scaled back and be good. I don't think, like people aren't built to live inside limits like that. W that isn't because our central mythologies are hero mythologies. There are about going out and transforming chaos into order. They're not about, you know, being guilty about who we are and having to live inside a fence for the safety of everything else.

Speaker 1:          25:42          And, and yet any of match a match how the ethos is precisely about that.

Speaker 2:          25:48          Well that's why you don't trust it. I think, you know, as a psychoanalyst, whenever anybody ever pause, it's a good, I always wonder, you know, what the downside to what their positing is and what the negative motivations might be. And I've met plenty. I've met plenty of environment metalists and heard from many more who clearly don't like people. I heard a professor at Queen's university when I was there doing a Tedx talk. It was one of the most appalling things I've ever heard in my life is this guy came out. Um, and he used the Tedx talk as a forum to harangue all the 18 and 19 year olds in the audience about, you know, the essential evilness of humanity. His decision to, to, I think you only had one child on his decision to limit as repor duction and his strong emphasis on the immorality of them doing anything but that.

Speaker 2:          26:41          So he's out there talking to all 18 and 19 year old kids. In his basic attitude was, you know, human beings are so awful that the only moral thing you can do as young people is to make bloody sure you don't replicate too many of yourselves. It's like, sorry, I didn't trust that guy. I think, I think I thought he was profoundly and dangerously anti human and a lot of the rhetoric that drives the environmentalist movement is resentful, anti humanism and it's, that's no, that's not the kind of thing that can guide the development of a positive future if that, you know, I've heard environment, let's say things like the planet would be better off if people, if there were no people on it or human beings are like a cancer. It's like, sorry buddy, I'm not taking any guidelines from you. That to me that sort of ethos is one step away from genocidal thinking. I really mean that too. No, it's, it's hatred for humanity under the guise of love of mother nature. You know, I think the same thing about a lot of the animal rights guys who want to, you know, give rats the same rights as people is they want nothing to have rights. They don't rat want wraps to have the rights of people there. It's very dangerous and,

Speaker 1:          27:57          and yet, and yet and yet for all fall on the critical, uh, notions that you bring to the a and the mentalist cause and those who, uh, who exhibited in the bureau and fashion yourself have a later became quite concerned with aspects of incremental, a distraction. And you've given a talk about it, about the need to rescue our oceans.

Speaker 2:          28:23          Yeah. Well that's pretty soon that talk will be online pretty soon. Well, I got invited to, to help work on a UN document a few years ago, which was the Secretary Generals High Level Panel on global sustainability. I think that was the name of it. It's got an awkward title so it escapes my mind. But I was invited by the Canadian who sat on the committee because he believed that the, um, underlying narrative of the UN document was outdated and inappropriate. And it was outdated because it was still kind of a cold war document. There was still a lot of north versus south in at and a lot of, uh, you know, capitalism versus socialism slash communism and you know, it was 40 years out of date. Plus it was far too pessimistic about the progress that human beings have made in the last 30 years. You know, it didn't take into account the fact that there aren't very many dictators anymore and that way fewer people are in poverty and that we've made a lot of progress in getting rid of terrible communicable diseases and that, you know, there are 7 billion of us and hardly anybody starving and our population has done to level off at 9,000,000,008 and then start to decline.

Speaker 2:          29:39          So we're in a bottleneck, but we might be able to get through it anyways. While I was working on that document and trying to clean up the underlying narratives, um, to make it more balanced. And I wouldn't say more optimistic, but less anti-human, I would say. I did a lot of reading about the ecological condition, so to speak. And you know about global warming and that kind of thing and pretty much everything I could get my hands on. And I read a lot of books on the state of the ocean and they were really depressing. I mean, we are really, really destroying the oceans and that's, that's not good. And it's not because I'm an environmentalist that I say that's not good. It's because anybody with any sense can see that the loss of the beauty and dynamism of the oceans would make the world a less good place to live in for people.

Speaker 2:          30:29          You know, not just for the creatures that are in the sea, but you really want to live in a ocean that's full of nothing but jellyfish. I mean, first of all, Jelly fish don't like human beings very much. If there's too many, too many of them around, you're not going to be doing a lot of swimming in the ocean. For example, I was reading this week, okay, most people don't know this, but you know, the ocean seems really big, but almost all the Fisher on the continental shelf and the continental shelf forney extends a couple of hundred miles off the continent, which is why it's called the continental shelf. And so it isn't that big an area and that's where all the fish are. Well, right now we trawl the continental shelf twice a year, completely, completely. That's like mowing the continent with a lawnmower twice a year. And you know, it's just, it's mind boggling.

Speaker 2:          31:27          And trawlers they're there, they're quite the things, you know, they basically, you with a trawler, you take a big way to net, like a huge way to knit and you drag it across the ocean floor and you disturb the entire surface of the floor and you raise a huge clouds of dust that, that pollute the water for, for even hundreds of miles around. And you take absolutely everything and then you haul it up to the surface and then you take one 10th of it, which is the stuff that you're allowed to harvest and that's commercially viable. The other 90% is dead and you throw all of that back. So I mean, that's only one of 50 stories about ocean degradation that you know, easily come to mind. So I think that's terrifying. And I also think that our obsessive concern with global warming is blinding us to, um, ecological catastrophes that are much more at hand and that would actually be more solvable. At least something could be done about them. So,

Speaker 1:          32:31          so we are almost 10 yet again, to summarize, it's a bit, um, uh, so, so we obviously the profound needs that we recognize I have to do with the damage that, that, uh, a thoughtless, uh, uh, advancement of technology and satisfaction of human needs as broad. Um, that's, that's a, obviously you feel powerfully about that, uh, as a, as regards to the oceans, uh,

Speaker 2:          33:02          I feel powerful you about it when it's done stupidly. I mean there's, you know, if you have a crop, if you have a herd of cows, you don't shoot every one of them. You know, that's, that's not good for you. It's not good for the cows, obviously, but it's really not good for you. So it isn't, it isn't, it isn't even the sacrifice of natural resources to the advancement of human beings. That concerns me. It's the fact that a lot of it's being done in a way that is clearly have no benefit to anyone.

Speaker 1:          33:35          Yeah. Wasteful. Uh, so, uh, the, the, the, the question, the question that, that we're trying to address here is, uh, is, um, how to think about the future and, and, uh, whether or not we can draw some solace from, uh, some notions about what the future can be to, to, to, to deal with, with the, the question of, uh, uh, of social meaning, because history was very much about, about offering us as a, as a, as a, as a mankind, mankind, as a, as a, as a collectivity Sam frame within which to think about the past, present, and then tomorrow. And the question is whether or not that frame, uh, it's available to us without that timeframe is available to us that allows us to bookend our existence.

Speaker 2:          34:35          Yeah. Well I said, you know, after, after many years of thinking about this, the, the, the, I, I've got kind of radically local in my, in my thinking I, because I became so disenchanted with large scale political solutions to things because of the dangers associated with that. I mean I think the way forward is for people to concentrate more intently on, on their individual lives and the quality and integrity of those lives and to learn what they can from Pur pursuing high quality, high integrity lies and then just start applying that at broader scales. It's a bottom up idea, you know, and it, it, I think it's, I think it's the properly he humble sort of idea. You know, it's getting your own house in order and then worry about what, I wouldn't say even the rest of the world at that point, get your own house in order and then worry about your local community if you can manage that than worry about what's beyond your local community.

Speaker 2:          35:37          And I, I think there is rich meaning and not, my experience has been that there's rich meaning and not because there's something about setting your own house in order that's really compelling. It's an adventure, it's a compelling adventure. It's also very difficult and you learn things from doing it, you know? And as I said, I've run lots of students through this process and they've essentially come to the same conclusion. So I would say the, the future isn't out in distant time anymore. Like it was. I think the future is right in front of us now and I mean literally right in front of us. And if we improve what's right in front of us, then that improvement will propagate out okay. Temporally and spatially. And I don't see what are other option is because what are you going to do? You're going to try to direct things 10, 10, 20 years into the future. God, I can't even imagine what's going to be like them.

Speaker 1:          36:37          Well, I, I think, I think a key phrase for this conversation in the future is here, and then that's the only way in which we can take care of it. Um, thank you, Jordan, uh, to be continued, uh, in, in the future. Either still this motto when we get back to work after some break. Uh, anyway. Uh, but thank you and, uh, are the best.

Speaker 2:          37:05          Bye. Bye.
