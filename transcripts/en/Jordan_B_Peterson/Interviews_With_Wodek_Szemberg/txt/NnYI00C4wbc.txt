Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello? Uh, my name is Boris Chamber and we produce, uh, with, uh, the agenda at Tvo. And I'm speaking with Jordan Peterson. I'm a clinical psychologist and professor of psychology at University of Toronto and the security duration of our conversation that we started a month ago, uh, about his new project. But your honesty project, I called 42. So reminders, uh, it, Justin, what the book is about.

Speaker 2:          00:29          Well, the book, I wrote a little article for an online site. He responds to questions about rules to live by, and the site's called Cora. And you could post any question or any answer on Cora. And so for awhile I was kind of interested in answering core questions and I answered that one. I came up with a list of 42 rules, which is probably more than he bargained for, but the list became my core standards quite popular. So, um, I talked to an agent book agent that I have been working with in Vancouver about the possibility of working it up into a book. And so that's, that's the origin story of this particular project.

Speaker 1:          01:14          So last time we talked about about, uh, uh, those items on your list would seem less than absolutely serious that to do with the reasons for why it is that we need to make one of our rules, uh, beautiful. Uh, they had to do with skateboarders and the respect they deserve and I such items. And today I would like to switch the gears a bit and, uh, talk about perhaps the one item on your list, uh, which, uh, which betrays a hint of a theme that seems to be missing in the book, which is the theme is death. And the last item on your list, the item number 42, is be grateful in spite of your suffering, uh, how much of that suffering that you are referring to has to do with the, uh, inevitability of death.

Speaker 2:          02:10          It's broader than that. I think in some ways. I mean, there's, if there's a large psychological literature on the human terror of death, but I think that the people who think that human beings are afraid of death are, are, are far too optimistic. Okay. We're afraid of a lot more than death. We're afraid of degeneration and deterioration and pain and betrayal and insanity and death. And you know, you could say that death is the most frightening of those, but it isn't because otherwise people wouldn't commit suicide.

Speaker 1:          02:46          Not to the extent that that has universal as opposed to the other items that you have mentioned. Uh, it doesn't, uh, that fair represents a kind of a extension of frame that a, that involves all of us.

Speaker 2:          02:59          Well, I think it's, I think the frame is better conceptualized as vulnerability with death being a sub element of that. You know, and I'm not trying to make light of the universality of death obviously, but, but it's a broader category of problem and when you're trying to address a problem that that's, that's that serious, it's very important to get the terminology perfectly straight. You know what I mean? People's relationship with death is rather ambivalent because I'm mean, there are any number of documented and continue in cases of people putting their lives on the line for things they believe in. So, you know, you could also make the case that the absence of meaning is a more terrifying prospect than the possibility of death. So, but regardless of old out there, there's still something fundamental at the bottom of this, which is addressed by that particular, um, rule, which is to be grateful in spite of your suffering.

Speaker 2:          03:54          And the rule there is that the fact that people bump up against their own limitations and their own vulnerabilities means that life is characterized in an, in a way that's, it's not fundamentally addressable or removable by suffering. And that's Buddhists dictate, right? The Great Buddhist dictate is that life is suffering. But, and people think of that as a pessimistic claim. And in one way it is. But, but I should point out too, that that claim isn't limited among religious thinkers to Buddhists. I mean the, the, the primary symbol of Christianity is a crucified person. The relationship between that suffering seems fairly self evident, especially when you also consider the drama of the crucifixion was also accompanied by betrayal and, and torture before death. You know? So it's kind of like the ultimate in catastrophic stories. And of course, Judaism concentrates to a large degree on a history of suffering and the way, the manner in which that might be addressed.

Speaker 2:          04:58          So with regards to being grateful, well, you might say, well, how can you be grateful as if your life is characterized by the necessity of suffering? Well, that needs to be stepped through. Very thoughtful. So the first thing is, why are you doomed to suffer? Like, why is life set up so that people are due to suffer? That's a constant existential complaint that sort of echoes through the centuries. I mean, you hear it in different ways. Why do good things happen to bad people, I suppose is the most cliched way of, of formulating the problem. But there's some deep answers to this question, like really deep answers and they're really helpful. And so one of them is, and I learned this partly from reading Jewish thought on the matter. And at the moment, I can't tell you what the sources were, but I read two things that were really helpful to me when I was trying to sort this out.

Speaker 2:          05:54          And one was a common buyer, uh, uh, Jewish commentator I think from the Talmud who said that it was pc. He made a, he presented a riddle, which is kind of like a Zen Koan. You know, Zen Koan is like the sound of one hand clapping just that actually this, so it's, you know, it's not that mysterious, but the question was it was about the nature of God. And so the question runs, if God is omniscient, omnipresent and omnipotent, which is sort of like the, the, the way that totality is being broken down into its sub elements, what could he possibly lock and answer? That is limitation. And so then there's a, there's a corollary to that to that is also derived from Jewish thought that runs that man in God or in the sense twins, they're like poles on a continuum and god is the infinite end of the continuum and man is the fine idea. Now the problem with the problem with being without limitation is that there's no,

Speaker 3:          07:00          okay,

Speaker 2:          07:00          there's no journey, there's no transformation, there's no change, there's no progress, there's no plot, there's nothing interesting. There's no differentiation between things because everything can be anything at any moment. And so the point of this Jewish line of thinking is that limitation is a blessing because it allows for being without limitation. There's no being. So that's okay. So that's a hell of an observation. Without limitation, there's no big. So then the next question might be, well, if, if, if being necessitates limitation and limitation generates suffering, then maybe being is not something to be respected, are devoutly hoped for. And that's been examined very carefully to, so for example, Mephistopheles the character girth girth, this character in false Mephistopheles who's obviously the devil, his basic credo is that because limited being produced as suffering, it should be eradicated because it, and the same argument is sort of made by Ivan in the brothers Karamazov he basically says, well look, the world's a corrupt place because there's all these limited beings running around in their suffering like mad.

Speaker 2:          08:16          Maybe it'd be better if the whole thing was just done away with. Well, unless you think that's a good idea. And apparently there have been people who have, it seems to be a really bad idea. But then you might ask, well, what's the alternative? And the alternative hypothetically is to figure out a way of life that's intrinsically meaningful enough so that the suffering is justified, not so that it can go away. And I think that the core, the purpose of religious thinking and the, and the goal towards which it's directed is to outline a motive being that justifies the suffering that life entails. And so if you live properly from a religious perspective, then the suffering is not so burdensome that it warps and, and corrupts you. And part of that is to be grateful.

Speaker 1:          09:12          Could have been, as I say, that the purpose of religious thought as to reconcile us to the fact of that.

Speaker 4:          09:20          Well,

Speaker 2:          09:21          yes, religious thought is often criticized thoughtlessly for that. So for example, this kind of started most mostly with the Marxist send the Floridians back at the end of the 19th century. So, you know, Freud believed that religion was a defense against death, death, anxiety. He thought about it as an infant title defense. You know that people were afraid of death and because of that they stayed infantiles and regarded, you know, generated a delusional hypothesis about the world being analogous to something being taken care of by an all knowing and all loving father who was going to pay us back for all the terrible limitations of suffering. Being Freud thought about that is very instant title. And then at the same time, Marx thought of religion from a defensive perspective as the opiate of the masses, right? Is that religion was something that the powers that be promoted because it in Europe, people to the suffering that was a necessary consequence. Well for marks at least of capitalist development. And you know, those critiques were extremely powerful. They dominated 20th century thought, but they're, they're fairly shallow.

Speaker 1:          10:31          Yeah. But they are by their reasons why they were accepted. I mean, it's hard because they're half true.

Speaker 1:          10:39          Well, no by, but I would say it's more than that. I mean, I think, I think that they, uh, uh, obviously, uh, meant to offer people a sense of, uh, of, uh, of their own life somehow. The idea of individualism and then social mastery of, of human affairs, uh, was to when there has independent of the shackles of, of uh, religious, uh, uh, dependents. Yeah. That worked really well. We ran from the shackles dependence into the shackles of video, logical dependents. No, I, I'm, I'm with you on that. But still, when ideas take as widely and as deeply as atheism has, it means since pills at role, it's not a false idea.

Speaker 2:          11:29          Oh yeah. It's not like this was a trivial conflict and I'm not trying to trivialize either fried your marks. Like I think Marx was fundamentally corrupt, but I don't think that if Freud, I think the Freudian criticism is an extremely deep one, but it's, it's, it is basically half true. I mean, one of the things that Charles Taylor pointed out, Taylor zone, philosopher Miguel and he wrote a book called, I think it was called the sources of the self. What? I mean, he took Freud's argument depart and he said, well, that's all well and good. If you, you know, you can think of religious belief as a naive, optimistic defense against death anxiety, let's say, except that the facts don't bear that out. Because in Christianity, for example, in the middle, the Middle Ages, and later there are people who are powerfully terrified of hell. And I mean, it's one thing to be afraid of death, but if you believe in hell, hell is a lot worse than death.

Speaker 2:          12:23          And so you might say, well, if you're going to conjure up a whole religion just to make you feel good about the fact that you know, to help you deal with the fact that you're going to die, why bother conjuring up a hell that you can suffer in forever if you make even the slightest moral error. And then, you know, that waits for you in infinitely. And you know, you'd have to be really cynical to say, well, you have to put something sour in the medicine to make it believable. It's like, it's not like that at all. But the develop medieval Christians were terrified of hell. Like modern people are terrified of meaninglessness. So you can't put at religions feet the proposition of some simplistic antidote to the fear of death. That's I know what Freud why for I did that and I think that religious belief like any beliefs can be used in an infant title manner, but as a deep criticism of religion, it's lacking and that's partly why you own in Freud eventually parted ways, you know, because you'll notice that there was more to religion than defense and that that has to do with this suffering issue because, because the antidote to suffering has meaning.

Speaker 2:          13:34          Now some of that meaning can be encapsulated in religious belief and that's sort of like the traditional guide to meaning, but if meaning is pursued properly, then people don't get corrupted by their suffering and that actually diminishes the net total of suffering, which is a really big, that's a really big gain. If you think suffering is the basic problem, you certainly don't want to approach it in a way that makes it worse. Like it's, it's, it's, it's, that's not an acceptable philosophical argument. If something's bad and you and you believe it's bad, you are not allowed to use an antidote that makes that thing works. If, if you're going to play that game, then people have to stop talking to you because you're violating the principle of noncontradiction and that's the basic principle for community. Without that principle, communication cannot take place. So you, if you play that game, you have to complete that by yourself in a corner.

Speaker 2:          14:28          You can't actually have a discussion with anybody if you've been to play that game. Now the gratitude issue is deeper too because one of the things that's pointed out, for example in genesis in the second chapter of Genesis or the second story of Genesis, that's the story of Cain and Abel Caine's big problem is that he's not grateful. He's really resentful and Cain enabler in some ways. The first two people and Keynes, a good guy and sort of like the model for good guys and Cain is a bad guy and he's the model for bad guys. They're sort of like Christ and Satan in their nascent forms and keynes. Big problem is that he's resentful and it really doesn't work out well. That makes him the first murderer. It also makes him the ancestor of the first person who makes tools of war. And so the in gratitude be characterized as Kane. I mean cane basically shakes his fist at God and says, you know, what sort of

Speaker 1:          15:20          is there for a reason. It's not meaning an accidental, that appearance. I mean, Cain and Abel are what they are because they intended to provide us with bookends of human possibilities.

Speaker 2:          15:34          Like cain. Cain makes the strongest possible rational argument for the meaninglessness of life. He's just like Ivan in the brothers Karamazov like, and one of the really, one of the things that's really deceitful, deceitful about rationality is that rationality also claims that it can be used to justify lights and it can't, rationality can be used to take life apart and to demolish its meaning, but it can't be used to. It can't be used as an antidote against meaninglessness.

Speaker 1:          16:05          It's too narrow a conduit. And Jordan, what's your thinking on the queer by, by the question of whether on uh, we are today more or less afraid of that than we used to have been, let's say 20 years ago. Any thoughts on this? Objects?

Speaker 2:          16:24          I think that we are in some ways and we're not in some ways, so we are in some ways because we don't really have to deal with it like people once did. And I think that a good thing or bad thing, no, I don't think it's a good thing at all. I think it keeps us permanently immature. I think it's a bad thing. I mean all of, all of the material that I've read that deals with such issues in a deep way suggests that the way that you overcome your fear of something is by voluntarily confronting it, not by running away from it. And I give you an example. I had a client once who was terrified of death. And when I say terrifying to death, I mean terrified of death. This woman tried to force herself into unconsciousness using various pharmacological means for like 20 hours a day for 10 years because she, she thought life was so unbearable that she didn't even want to be awake for it.

Speaker 2:          17:21          And she was a vegetarian because partly because she couldn't, she couldn't even tolerate walking into a butcher store like, so she, she was, she was too terrified. And I mean, I took her to a bunch of store at one point and watched her, I mean, which is a, it's a classic approach in psychotherapy to have people come to confront the things they're afraid of, but she was so terrified of death that it made it impossible for her to live. Now what happened with her eventually guided by her dreams because her dream suggested what to do. I took her to a embalming human and momming, you know, uh, a great reburial preparation and well the first thing that happened was, although she was absolutely terrified to go there and didn't think that she would be able to angle it and like it's not a trivial thing cause we were only about eight feet away from the embalming and it was just her and me and the person who was doing me and mommy and I mean it's a pretty, it's not one of, it's a, it's a pretty visceral experience, let's put it that way.

Speaker 2:          18:22          And you know, she looked away a lot during the procedure for the first 15 minutes or so, but, but she didn't leave. Then after 15 minutes or so, she was able to focus on the procedure pretty closely. And at one point she was even able to lay your hand on the body. I mean she had a glove on and it was all very carefully done and that was really useful to her cause it kind of calibrated her in some way. It taught her the difference between what there is to be afraid of. That's real. And all the shades and nightmares that people encounter that are just in some ways there, you know, demonic or pathological figments of their imagination. It was also very useful to me because I haven't done a lot of looking at a human. The caucus, well, I'm very squeamish. I wouldn't say that I'm actually very sensitive to discussed.

Speaker 2:          19:11          It's a biological proclivity and so this is part of me. I could have never been a surgeon than I would. I would have a very difficult time dealing with people, people's physiological trouble, you know, I don't have the stomach for it, but it was really useful for me to go to the funeral home. Not so much because I viewed the moment, but because it gave me a chance to talk through the processes that are associated with depth, with someone who deals with it on a regular basis. You know, if human beings, primary fear was death, there wouldn't be any funeral home operators. How the hell could they manage it? Well when I talked to the guys about that too, you know, and about how they, what sort of effect dealing with death on a nonstop basis had on their lives and how they viewed the role.

Speaker 2:          19:54          And you know, they view their role in some ways as shepherds, right? They were shepherding people through the process of death, which throws everything up in the air. And they were there to ritualize it in a way, and they took that responsibility seriously. But it was also useful to me to figure out exactly what the practical steps were involved in dealing with death. Because at some point you're going to have that responsibility. Someone close to you is going to die. And at that point you're either going to run around, you know, in a complete neurotic fit and be more trouble than you're worth. Are you going to step up to the plate and be helpful and um, you know, and be strong and help the people who have to deal with that catastrophe, do it in a straightforward manner. And that's a, that's a responsibility that people have. And to be a complete human being, you have to be strong enough to do that and you're not going to be that way if you run away from it. The thing about people is they're stronger than the fear of death. Death is terrible, but we're stronger than that.

Speaker 1:          20:57          You had the reason to think about is some, some weeks or months ago we had a bit of health problem and you didn't know what it was or you thought that was worse than it actually was. And, and you told me that you were thinking about possibility of dying.

Speaker 2:          21:12          Yeah, well I hadn't, I had a lung shadow on a, on an x ray and which I thought was, you know, radiological error or something similar. But then for unrelated reasons, a month and a half or so later, yeah, I started to get short of breath and then my energy level's declined precipitously and I thought, Huh, that's not a great combination. Lung Shadow plus cancer symptoms, you know? So

Speaker 1:          21:39          some days thinking about that by the possibility of, of much to premature demise, how, how, how would you think, uh, what were your thoughts like?

Speaker 2:          21:50          Well, the first thing I should say is that's not unfamiliar territory for me. You know, I spent like really I spent, when I was writing my first book, I spent like a decade thinking about death. And I mean it was really in some ways an obsession. It was more the book's about me and not about death. But as you already pointed out, those two things are very tightly linked. I mean, for, for months, years, even the first thought I had on waking up was, uh, life is short. You know, I was very, very conscious of time passing by and, and potentially time passing by in a meaningless and useless manner. Now why that was the case, God only knows, you know, it's very difficult to understand what tribes are most spontaneous motivation. You wouldn't have to go with the federal fee for that, you know? Well, I did, but you know, it was, I just happened to be conducting the therapy. You can do a lot of therapy by reading and by thinking and bike riding. And I mean, there's a technical literature on that. Writing is unbelievably therapeutic. It makes you healthier

Speaker 1:          22:56          the way you managed to think about the possibility of an early death.

Speaker 2:          23:02          Yeah. Well I mean what was, there was an element of black humor to it I think, which is something that's often, it's like the source of black humor really. Cause there's an absurdity about death, right? Because within the sort of human domain of striving through our rules, which has been, if you work hard and you do the right thing, then good things happen to you. It's like a game. You're playing. The game has these rules and if you play it properly then you get the benefits. But death is something that's sort of outside the rules of all games and whether you've been playing the game properly or not, it doesn't have that much effect on your ultimate vulnerability. And so there's a, there's an absurdity about that, you know, having come this far to be cut down, you know, at 50 cause I'm, I'm 50 seemed absurd.

Speaker 2:          23:56          And so there was that element, although I'm kind of used to absurdity in a way. So that didn't bother me so much. But what really bothered me, I think it wasn't so much the contemplation of my own disappearance as what I would miss, you know? And, and what the consequences of that would also be for my family. You know, because when you leave, you leave a hole and that's unpleasant hope. Hopefully it's up and you miss things. And that's a tragedy. I mean, and you know, so I had to, I had to sort through that. I guess it made it more personal.

Speaker 1:          24:31          I'm curious about this concern for the wellbeing of uh, uh, you know, Tammy, your wife and your children. Um, Eh, when you, did you feel that, that, were you afraid? I mean, we're, we're terrified of, of, uh, uh, of losing touch with that, which is kind of the only true reality, you know, because, uh, or did you do have an access to thoughts and feelings about the possibility of an afterlife?

Speaker 2:          25:09          Okay. First of all, we mean the world is a very strange place. And for me, ignorance, one of the things about humility, let's say something that's associated to some degree with gratitude. Humility is recognition of your, of your ignorance. And limits and people think that recognition of your ignorance and limits is a frightening thing. So they often act in a narcissistic way and lay claim to more knowledge than they have, but there comes a point if you think things through that the fact that you're ignorant is a great comfort. Okay, okay. You know, I mean for me to be properly terrified and death in the sort of the classic way, I would have to assume that I knew what life meant and how, why and how it is that we're here and how our consciousness operates and what the relationship is between consciousness and material reality and how time works and what's the relationship between the present and infinity and like not only do we not understand those things, we don't understand them at all.

Speaker 2:          26:16          We don't understand consciousness at all. We know, for example, the physicists have taught us that there's an intake or relationship between consciousness and the manifestation of the transformation of possibility into actuality. Consciousness transforms actuality into our potentiality to actuality, and it does that literally in that before something is consciously perceived. It exists as like a set of possibilities, none of which are specified. And it isn't till consciousness observes it, that it snaps into actual being. This isn't metaphysics, this is quantum physics and quantum physics is why we're talking to one another and underlies all the electronics we use. It underlies everything. And it's the only scientific theory that we've ever produced but has never made a prediction error. So it's as right as things get with regards to an afterlife. I mean, I've had strange experiences that have taught me things about the potential nature of consciousness and, and so that makes me unwilling to make any final claims about what's immortal and what's mortal and how those things are related and how I'm tangled up in that. I don't know, but I'm so ignorant about that, that I can't say it really terrifies me.

Speaker 1:          27:38          There was the one thing is

Speaker 3:          27:43          okay

Speaker 1:          27:44          and obviously interesting about, about being modern living, you know, uh, at the beginning of the 21st century is that, is that so many of us have grown up without any reliance on the thought of the possibility of afterlife. Uh, though, though what's also interesting is that we also living in a time when there are many, uh, people who increasingly imagine the possibility of extending the lifespan of consciousness, if not of the physical bodies by, by the process of, of, uh, by imagining that consciousness can be digitized and, and, and, and that can be then uploaded or downloaded into, into, uh, into, uh, add the vehicles of life rather than the

Speaker 2:          28:32          uploaded into our digital reality where there's at least 26 digital virgins waiting for you. I think that's the ultimate,

Speaker 1:          28:40          the number is 76, seven.

Speaker 2:          28:41          Okay.

Speaker 1:          28:46          What, do you have any response to that proposition that that is possible to imagine consciousness to be made, to be a tonal?

Speaker 2:          28:58          I think it's silly,

Speaker 2:          29:04          technically silly because there's just so many things it doesn't take into account. Like it's based on a very peculiar apprehension of what constitutes consciousness. Like it's a shallow, it's a shallow approach to a deep problem. So for example, we, it seems that consciousness requires embodiment. Now, you know, modern Kwanzaa, I atheists have the idea that sort of alerts at the bottom of their thinking that the soul is sort of like a, it's sort of like a disembodied ghost. It looks like a body, but you can see through it and have some of the attributes of a body because otherwise it couldn't exist. But like it's very vague and ill defined. And so, okay, you're going to upload your consciousness. Okay, fine. So what exactly are you uploading? You're not blowing, you're not blowing your anxiety. You can upload your pain, you cannot devote your hunger.

Speaker 2:          30:01          Are you going to upload your sexual desire or are going to be free of all of that? Okay, well you want to be free of all that. Well, what are you then, what's left of you? If your limitations are all gone, what's left of you? That's a weird thing because you think, well, if your limitations are all gone, then you're, you're without limitation. It's like the genie has escaped from the, from the little lamp. Well you need the lamp. No, no lab, no genie. So you're an upload your consciousness. Oh yeah. And then what are you going to do, you know, sit inside a computer, why you can have any motivation to do anything. Because like your motivation, we know your motivation is all tied intrinsically to your physiology. So, so it's, it's like to me that the engineers who talk about it's Marvin minsky mostly he's talked about uploading and Curt Swan. Yeah, but it's from, it's from Mitski essentially. It's like there's lots of things that are smart about engineers, but metaphysical philosophy is not one of them. And so I read that stuff and I think like

Speaker 2:          31:09          you guys are as bad at talking about Meta physics as postmodernist humanists are talking about engineering. Like you should just stay out of it because it's your, the, the approach. I think the approach is basically equivalent to that. That characterizes a really curious and precocious 13 year old. There's no real thinking that goes along with it. It's like a dream while we could upload our consciousness into a machine. Well that's a dream. It's a myth. It's like the myth of the Golem or the myth of Frankenstein. Obviously, if we can only transcend this body and put ourselves into something else was like, sorry guys, you're gonna have to do a lot more thinking about that issue before you can have an intelligent discussion about it.

Speaker 1:          31:58          Uh, Jordan, we will stop now because I think we've talked long enough and the next time, uh, whatever that's going to be, we will then talk about next topic, which we then managed to squeeze into this one, which is we just have to think about the future. I want to say one more thing, just talk

Speaker 2:          32:19          part of what I was this little, this 42 exercises is sort of an exercise. I'm hoping that will involve the mapping of very deep ideas onto sort of everyday issues cause deep ideas should be related to everyday issues in a niche like indirectly because everyday things are deep. Now the viewpoint, like

Speaker 2:          32:44          we've talked about this before, you and I privately but, but it, it's something that has to be stated in order to make this kind of conversation intelligible. I am not a materialist. Like some people say that but they don't mean it. But I mean it, I don't think the most real things of the world, our material, and I think the fact that we think that they are makes us ill. That's existential illness. It's actually an illness and the reason it's an illness is it speak it because it's predicated on a view of the world that's solely incomplete that it can't function. Now, one of the pieces of evidence that it can't function is people's existential angst and the fact that they're driven to find systems of meaning, especially in the 20th century that were extremely pathological. They're driven into the arms of pathological replacements. There's an alternative, like if you're not a materialist, you have to pause it.

Speaker 2:          33:39          That something else. Is that the ground of being cause it's material for materialists. Even though if you look into material hard enough like the quantum physicists do, it turns into something that's so unlike material that you know you might as well not if you've been bothered with the whole materialism to begin with because if you think religion is weird, you know you should read quantum physics for a while. I don't think that material is the most real thing. I think the most real thing is meaning. And I think that meaning is a real thing. Not only that, it's real, that it's the most real thing. And I also think that you're set up physiologically, materially if you want all the evidence is that your physiology responds to meaning and not to material reality. That's when, when we talk about the future, we'll talk about that a little bit more because when you interact with the future, what you're interacting with is the meaning of possibilities.

Speaker 2:          34:34          That is what the future is. It's the meaning of possibilities. And I don't mean that metaphorically. I mean that literally, and not only do I mean that literally, I mean biologically in that that's what your brain does. Your brain apprehends the mirror, yet meaningful possibilities of the multiple futures that could manifest themselves. And that's what you interact with. And modern people are so dopey. They think they interact with material and that makes them sick. That idea because it's, it's not a sustaining idea and they don't even act that way. They say things like, well, you know, you have to make the most of your potential. And then they don't even notice that they're saying something that's entirely nonsensical from a materialist perspective. It's like, what the hell is this potential that you're talking about? You can't measure it. It only exists in possibility. It only exists as something you could conceivably bring into being or interfere with. Even though everyone knows that, you know, not living up to your po possibility and not fulfilling potential is a great sin. No one notices that. You just can't say something like that and be a materialist. We will, we will continue this next time and we talk about the multiple futures, uh, but for the time being, thanks Jordan and see you again.
