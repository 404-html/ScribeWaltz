1
00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:01.890
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hi Jordan.</v>

2
00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.100
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what x number of a producer with the</v>

3
00:00:05.101 --> 00:00:05.934
<v Speaker 1>agenda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve in the TVO and you are Jordan </v>

4
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:10.823
<v Speaker 1>Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>professor of psychology at the </v>

5
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.800
<v Speaker 1>University of Toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is our third conversation about</v>

6
00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:21.090
<v Speaker 1>various subjects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this one we decided there's going to</v>

7
00:00:21.091 --> 00:00:21.840
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.340
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the future,</v>

9
00:00:24.341 --> 00:00:28.360
<v Speaker 1>the idea of it and then perhaps even the</v>
<v Speaker 1>actuality,</v>

10
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason why,</v>

11
00:00:30.371 --> 00:00:31.500
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

12
00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:32.343
<v Speaker 1>the future is the subjects because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I have talked much about it and let </v>

13
00:00:36.461 --> 00:00:37.920
<v Speaker 1>me start with my own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

14
00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brief take on it.</v>

15
00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:41.523
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my sense is that we are running out of </v>

16
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.220
<v Speaker 1>future with capital apps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

17
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.000
<v Speaker 1>for about 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

18
00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.170
<v Speaker 1>we had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

19
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the um,</v>

20
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the I and access to,</v>

21
00:00:54.821 --> 00:00:58.330
<v Speaker 1>to the idea of future as an ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>growing,</v>

22
00:00:58.331 --> 00:01:03.331
<v Speaker 1>ever improving a prospect for humanity </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a,</v>

23
00:01:03.421 --> 00:01:08.421
<v Speaker 1>and we are at the point where we no </v>
<v Speaker 1>longer have easy access to that belief.</v>

24
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.300
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you agree?</v>

25
00:01:13.301 --> 00:01:15.910
<v Speaker 1>And if so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think is responsible for it?</v>

26
00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.973
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me like it's a continuation </v>

27
00:01:20.041 --> 00:01:20.874
<v Speaker 2>of the process that needs to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the late 18 hundreds when he </v>

28
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.770
<v Speaker 2>described the death of God.</v>

29
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

30
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the death of God,</v>

31
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:29.503
<v Speaker 2>he man really the collapse of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christianity or maybe of Judeo </v>

32
00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.993
<v Speaker 2>Christianity and the loss of the meeting</v>
<v Speaker 2>structure that went along with that at </v>

33
00:01:37.511 --> 00:01:38.344
<v Speaker 2>the same time as he proclaimed that </v>
<v Speaker 2>itchy also hypothesized or prophecy </v>

34
00:01:44.681 --> 00:01:46.670
<v Speaker 2>really that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

35
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.993
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that belief system would be replaced by </v>

36
00:01:49.511 --> 00:01:50.344
<v Speaker 2>is that vast political belief systems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He thought co I've communism </v>

37
00:01:53.801 --> 00:01:57.740
<v Speaker 2>particularly and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he knew that even at that early time</v>

38
00:01:57.741 --> 00:01:58.574
<v Speaker 2>that many millions of people would die </v>
<v Speaker 2>during the transition and meaning </v>

39
00:02:01.401 --> 00:02:04.850
<v Speaker 2>systems and now that we're out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>20th century,</v>

40
00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:06.303
<v Speaker 2>those of collapse too mean very few </v>
<v Speaker 2>people hold any brief with Utopian </v>

41
00:02:12.741 --> 00:02:13.574
<v Speaker 2>political views,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether they're on the right or the </v>

42
00:02:15.051 --> 00:02:17.000
<v Speaker 2>left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we've also lost that.</v>

43
00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.843
<v Speaker 2>Then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's left after that and announced </v>

44
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.520
<v Speaker 2>that seems to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's anybody's guess.</v>

45
00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.710
<v Speaker 2>I think we're also swamped by </v>
<v Speaker 2>technological change that's occurring at</v>

46
00:02:29.711 --> 00:02:33.580
<v Speaker 2>such a rate that it's become impossible </v>
<v Speaker 2>to predict the direction of the future.</v>

47
00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.900
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but obviously when,</v>

48
00:02:35.901 --> 00:02:40.000
<v Speaker 1>when we talk about the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we imagined a moral enhancement,</v>

49
00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

50
00:02:41.351 --> 00:02:43.010
<v Speaker 1>of the human condition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

51
00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.530
<v Speaker 1>we imagined that a progress man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only technological progress,</v>

52
00:02:47.531 --> 00:02:50.860
<v Speaker 1>not only economic progress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but moral progress.</v>

53
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.440
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

54
00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.393
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the question is whether or not this </v>

55
00:02:57.081 --> 00:03:00.640
<v Speaker 1>was adler a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a viable</v>

56
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:01.503
<v Speaker 2>prospect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't just a watered down </v>

57
00:03:03.161 --> 00:03:04.730
<v Speaker 2>Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

58
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.420
<v Speaker 2>for the benefit of those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

59
00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:08.623
<v Speaker 2>who've lost faith niches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Primary point with the death of God was </v>

60
00:03:13.331 --> 00:03:17.950
<v Speaker 2>that you can't have moral improvement </v>
<v Speaker 2>without a moral system because you know,</v>

61
00:03:17.951 --> 00:03:20.890
<v Speaker 2>people think there are things that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>self evidently moral,</v>

62
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.370
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it turns out that they're part of a much</v>

63
00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:26.110
<v Speaker 2>broader fabric.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yes,</v>

64
00:03:26.111 --> 00:03:28.210
<v Speaker 2>I would say to some degree it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

65
00:03:28.211 --> 00:03:29.044
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the remnants of water down Christianity </v>

66
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.780
<v Speaker 2>playing itself out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the question,</v>

67
00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:36.970
<v Speaker 2>I suppose to some degree is what's after</v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

68
00:03:36.971 --> 00:03:38.060
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

69
00:03:38.061 --> 00:03:38.894
<v Speaker 2>the atheists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially the radical atheists would </v>

70
00:03:40.661 --> 00:03:41.950
<v Speaker 2>have us believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

71
00:03:41.951 --> 00:03:42.784
<v Speaker 2>we could move towards a kind of rational</v>
<v Speaker 2>sense of the world along with whatever </v>

72
00:03:47.021 --> 00:03:50.740
<v Speaker 2>rational ethic would go along with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I don't really believe that.</v>

73
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.353
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's much reason to </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe that people will become more </v>

74
00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:56.230
<v Speaker 2>rational as the future progresses.</v>

75
00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they might become more diverse.</v>

76
00:03:58.681 --> 00:04:02.230
<v Speaker 2>Lee Irrational.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of how it looks to me.</v>

77
00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.540
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean by that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That nervously rational,</v>

78
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.633
<v Speaker 2>he diversely irrational,</v>
<v Speaker 2>splintered into their own little </v>

79
00:04:09.671 --> 00:04:11.680
<v Speaker 2>subgroups of meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose.</v>

80
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.053
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would we assume that people would </v>

81
00:04:14.981 --> 00:04:18.550
<v Speaker 2>become more homogenous?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Homogenous when in their,</v>

82
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:21.010
<v Speaker 2>in their private,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in their private beliefs.</v>

83
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.903
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rise of all these strange new age </v>

84
00:04:23.051 --> 00:04:24.620
<v Speaker 2>religions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you know,</v>

85
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.473
<v Speaker 2>we'll have collected any number of Dave </v>
<v Speaker 2>ots seems to indicate that there's </v>

86
00:04:28.781 --> 00:04:29.614
<v Speaker 2>plenty of room on the irrational side </v>
<v Speaker 2>and mean Islamic fundamentalism </v>

87
00:04:33.821 --> 00:04:36.610
<v Speaker 2>certainly hasn't managed Jenny </v>
<v Speaker 2>disappearance.</v>

88
00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.990
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you could think of that as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>last great hangover of the,</v>

89
00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.180
<v Speaker 2>of the Abrahamic religions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

90
00:04:43.181 --> 00:04:43.990
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that'll,</v>

91
00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.823
<v Speaker 2>that'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's under attack and will disappear </v>

92
00:04:46.481 --> 00:04:47.314
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I don't see that people are </v>

93
00:04:49.001 --> 00:04:52.960
<v Speaker 2>progressing towards the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>rationality that the atheists would like</v>

94
00:04:52.961 --> 00:04:55.630
<v Speaker 2>to presume as are our natural </v>
<v Speaker 2>destination.</v>

95
00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:57.003
<v Speaker 2>Just I just don't think people are that </v>
<v Speaker 2>rational or capable of that degree of </v>

96
00:05:00.251 --> 00:05:01.690
<v Speaker 2>rationality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

97
00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.410
<v Speaker 2>What's the argument for that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

98
00:05:05.411 --> 00:05:07.990
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the incompleteness of </v>
<v Speaker 2>rationality.</v>

99
00:05:07.991 --> 00:05:09.670
<v Speaker 2>Personally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think,</v>

100
00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't think rationality can survive on</v>
<v Speaker 2>its own.</v>

101
00:05:12.221 --> 00:05:15.340
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like the capitalist system.</v>

102
00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.430
<v Speaker 2>It has to be embedded within a </v>
<v Speaker 2>functioning government.</v>

103
00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:23.490
<v Speaker 2>No matter what the capitalists claim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the market isn't the bottom governmental</v>

104
00:05:23.621 --> 00:05:24.670
<v Speaker 2>agreements,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bottom,</v>

105
00:05:24.671 --> 00:05:25.504
<v Speaker 2>the ultimate container and rationality </v>
<v Speaker 2>has to survive within a mythology and </v>

106
00:05:29.861 --> 00:05:30.694
<v Speaker 2>the rational is don't believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think that that's just because </v>

107
00:05:32.951 --> 00:05:34.900
<v Speaker 2>they're still protected by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mythology.</v>

108
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.380
<v Speaker 2>They can get away with that clint </v>
<v Speaker 2>rationality.</v>

109
00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.300
<v Speaker 2>Once you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once you agree on the presuppositions,</v>

110
00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.030
<v Speaker 2>then rationality can guide you to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>destination.</v>

111
00:05:46.031 --> 00:05:46.864
<v Speaker 2>But I don't see how rationality can help</v>
<v Speaker 2>you establish the presuppositions at </v>

112
00:05:49.901 --> 00:05:51.940
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's more important?</v>

113
00:05:51.941 --> 00:05:56.770
<v Speaker 2>Curing cancer or stopping stopping the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whale hunt?</v>

114
00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:58.580
<v Speaker 2>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's look at it that way.</v>

115
00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:59.503
<v Speaker 2>What's more important?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Putting money into education or for </v>

116
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:07.550
<v Speaker 2>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or healthcare.</v>

117
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.660
<v Speaker 2>There's these terrible moral decisions </v>
<v Speaker 2>about</v>

118
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:10.633
<v Speaker 1>which normally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>normally we don't need to decide either </v>

119
00:06:13.451 --> 00:06:13.871
<v Speaker 1>or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

120
00:06:13.871 --> 00:06:18.300
<v Speaker 1>normally in the course of human affairs </v>
<v Speaker 1>we decide that,</v>

121
00:06:18.301 --> 00:06:20.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we will throw certain amount,</v>

122
00:06:20.491 --> 00:06:21.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for this,</v>

123
00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:22.443
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>goal and another amount for another </v>

124
00:06:24.041 --> 00:06:24.691
<v Speaker 1>goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

125
00:06:24.691 --> 00:06:25.680
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

126
00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.300
<v Speaker 1>and the amounts might shift,</v>
<v Speaker 1>might shift.</v>

127
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:31.610
<v Speaker 1>It's never a question or so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

128
00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.690
<v Speaker 1>so the question of I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I would,</v>

129
00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:35.793
<v Speaker 1>people who are watching this might </v>
<v Speaker 1>really want to understand what it is </v>

130
00:06:39.131 --> 00:06:41.550
<v Speaker 1>that you mean by presuppositions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

131
00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:45.040
<v Speaker 1>that said that that needs to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>embedded.</v>

132
00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.200
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before we can talk about the reason</v>

133
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:52.663
<v Speaker 2>a functioning belief system helps you </v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out what things are more </v>

134
00:06:55.521 --> 00:06:59.580
<v Speaker 2>important than what other things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

135
00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:01.160
<v Speaker 2>those are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are,</v>

136
00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:04.370
<v Speaker 2>I suppose the 10 commandments would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>an example of that.</v>

137
00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:05.773
<v Speaker 2>Are there things that are supposed to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>established without question and you </v>

138
00:07:10.041 --> 00:07:10.874
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might think some of them are </v>

139
00:07:11.241 --> 00:07:12.074
<v Speaker 2>obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People say that about the 10 </v>

140
00:07:12.951 --> 00:07:15.020
<v Speaker 2>commandments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thou shalt not kill.</v>

141
00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.250
<v Speaker 2>That's obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

142
00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:17.173
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it turns out that that's not so obvious </v>

143
00:07:18.891 --> 00:07:21.470
<v Speaker 2>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's obvious because it's,</v>

144
00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:25.250
<v Speaker 2>it's such an inherent part of our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fabric of our society.</v>

145
00:07:25.251 --> 00:07:26.084
<v Speaker 2>And we assume that it's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's been lots of societies that </v>

146
00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:32.150
<v Speaker 2>have been organized around the </v>
<v Speaker 2>principles of the warriors societies,</v>

147
00:07:32.151 --> 00:07:34.460
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we're already,</v>

148
00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:37.310
<v Speaker 2>we're already discussing exceptions to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the rule.</v>

149
00:07:37.311 --> 00:07:38.810
<v Speaker 2>Thou shalt not kill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

150
00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:42.500
<v Speaker 2>that didn't that happen in Quebec this </v>
<v Speaker 2>week,</v>

151
00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:44.120
<v Speaker 2>isn't Quebec debating?</v>

152
00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.400
<v Speaker 2>I use Neisha bill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

153
00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:47.693
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

154
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:48.890
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

155
00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:50.093
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously even something as obvious as </v>

156
00:07:52.321 --> 00:07:56.490
<v Speaker 2>thou shalt not kill can be nibbled to </v>
<v Speaker 2>death around the,</v>

157
00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:58.890
<v Speaker 2>around the margins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not obvious.</v>

158
00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:01.560
<v Speaker 2>And these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these belief systems,</v>

159
00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:04.080
<v Speaker 2>the Judeo Christian belief system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

160
00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:06.390
<v Speaker 2>and this again is something that needs </v>
<v Speaker 2>to point it out,</v>

161
00:08:06.391 --> 00:08:10.200
<v Speaker 2>is it's whole cloth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't unravel part of it without the</v>

162
00:08:10.201 --> 00:08:11.034
<v Speaker 2>rest of it unraveling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one of the precept positions is that </v>

163
00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.690
<v Speaker 2>there's a judge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's God.</v>

164
00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.930
<v Speaker 2>Something's watching you and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimate response,</v>

165
00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.420
<v Speaker 2>ultimately responsible for your moral </v>
<v Speaker 2>actions.</v>

166
00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.670
<v Speaker 2>That's a big precept position,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

167
00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:29.060
<v Speaker 2>and that's gone.</v>

168
00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:36.570
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's gone for a significant minority.</v>

169
00:08:36.571 --> 00:08:37.361
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most,</v>

170
00:08:37.361 --> 00:08:41.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the a 7 billion people,</v>

171
00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:42.443
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

172
00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:46.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do partake of some kind of a faith.</v>

173
00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:47.693
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

174
00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:51.070
<v Speaker 2>But still have the notion of the future </v>
<v Speaker 2>though too.</v>

175
00:08:51.071 --> 00:08:51.540
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There,</v>

176
00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:54.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's plenty of idea of future in</v>

177
00:08:54.461 --> 00:08:57.870
<v Speaker 2>the developing the few times to catch up</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the west.</v>

178
00:08:58.310 --> 00:08:58.870
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

179
00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:02.900
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're there the in some ways,</v>

180
00:09:02.901 --> 00:09:05.930
<v Speaker 1>but what we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we are discovering is that the real</v>

181
00:09:05.931 --> 00:09:07.250
<v Speaker 1>driver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

182
00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:08.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

183
00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:13.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in future is not as not a desire</v>

184
00:09:13.251 --> 00:09:15.170
<v Speaker 1>for heightened morality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

185
00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:17.600
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or universal morality.</v>

186
00:09:17.601 --> 00:09:18.260
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

187
00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:23.260
<v Speaker 1>but the poverty and the poverty is what </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes people want to improve their lot.</v>

188
00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:26.000
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

189
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.200
<v Speaker 2>there's no doubt that the western </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries in some sense,</v>

190
00:09:30.201 --> 00:09:31.034
<v Speaker 2>solve the problem of poverty and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>still have the problem of relative </v>

191
00:09:34.071 --> 00:09:35.870
<v Speaker 2>poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

192
00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.030
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

193
00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:42.080
<v Speaker 2>the material wealth that we have seems </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be preferable to absolute poverty.</v>

194
00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:47.110
<v Speaker 2>And so that means that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the drive for progress that,</v>

195
00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:50.720
<v Speaker 2>that drove the West is still alive and </v>
<v Speaker 2>well in the developing countries.</v>

196
00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:51.823
<v Speaker 2>It's thriving too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because those countries are in fact </v>

197
00:09:53.931 --> 00:09:56.300
<v Speaker 2>lifting themselves out of poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

198
00:09:56.301 --> 00:09:57.134
<v Speaker 2>whether or not to us,</v>

199
00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:59.590
<v Speaker 1>but they already know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that uh,</v>

200
00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:04.620
<v Speaker 1>that if they will proceed along the path</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we've already walked,</v>

201
00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:07.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the last a hundred,</v>

202
00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:09.350
<v Speaker 1>hundred 50 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

203
00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:10.253
<v Speaker 1>they will catch up with us and with our </v>
<v Speaker 1>kinds of problems and with our kinds of </v>

204
00:10:15.241 --> 00:10:19.830
<v Speaker 1>questions about where to go next.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

205
00:10:19.831 --> 00:10:23.670
<v Speaker 1>and so here he will return to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>question about,</v>

206
00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:25.950
<v Speaker 1>about the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do we,</v>

207
00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:31.190
<v Speaker 1>do we need I an idea about how the story</v>
<v Speaker 1>ends for be able to,</v>

208
00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:34.950
<v Speaker 1>to live it properly?</v>

209
00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:39.010
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in New York on Friday with a group</v>

210
00:10:39.011 --> 00:10:43.900
<v Speaker 2>called future earths and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're a group that was composed of,</v>

211
00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:45.203
<v Speaker 2>let me just see here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two major international science </v>

212
00:10:51.331 --> 00:10:54.810
<v Speaker 2>consortium's natural science and social </v>
<v Speaker 2>science.</v>

213
00:10:54.811 --> 00:10:55.644
<v Speaker 2>And that's exactly the sort of argument </v>
<v Speaker 2>or other sort of the questions they're </v>

214
00:10:58.140 --> 00:10:58.973
<v Speaker 2>trying to address.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the UN just produced a report on </v>

215
00:11:01.741 --> 00:11:02.574
<v Speaker 2>sustainable development,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a document that is trying to </v>

216
00:11:05.391 --> 00:11:08.420
<v Speaker 2>address that question as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are we looking at?</v>

217
00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:12.260
<v Speaker 2>Those documents tend to stress limits to</v>
<v Speaker 2>growth,</v>

218
00:11:12.261 --> 00:11:13.760
<v Speaker 2>at least to some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

219
00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:14.623
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

220
00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:15.553
<v Speaker 2>they're based on the presupposition that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're running up against planetary </v>

221
00:11:17.991 --> 00:11:21.710
<v Speaker 2>boundaries in our search for increasing </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolute wealth.</v>

222
00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:27.670
<v Speaker 2>And that we have to figure out a way of </v>
<v Speaker 2>structuring our future so that it can be</v>

223
00:11:29.401 --> 00:11:33.910
<v Speaker 2>sustainable across some longterm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the idea of sustainability,</v>

224
00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:36.900
<v Speaker 2>whatever that means is trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

225
00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:41.290
<v Speaker 2>is being posed as the alternative tube,</v>
<v Speaker 2>continual positive growth.</v>

226
00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:42.783
<v Speaker 2>And there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's variants of that like </v>

227
00:11:43.541 --> 00:11:48.541
<v Speaker 2>sustainable development,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means continual improvement within</v>

228
00:11:49.281 --> 00:11:50.114
<v Speaker 2>the boundaries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things that's changed </v>

229
00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.180
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

230
00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.500
<v Speaker 2>we're starting to understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that yeah,</v>

231
00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:58.633
<v Speaker 2>we now have the technological capability</v>
<v Speaker 2>to exceed the planet's carrying power </v>

232
00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:06.190
<v Speaker 2>carrying capacity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we have to do something about that.</v>

233
00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:07.473
<v Speaker 2>No one's really sure how to translate </v>
<v Speaker 2>that recognition of limitation into an </v>

234
00:12:11.301 --> 00:12:15.920
<v Speaker 2>ethic for action.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And most of the translation you see is,</v>

235
00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:19.090
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be more environmentally sensitive,</v>

236
00:12:19.091 --> 00:12:20.630
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

237
00:12:20.631 --> 00:12:23.450
<v Speaker 2>keep the environment in mind when you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>making your local decisions.</v>

238
00:12:23.451 --> 00:12:28.451
<v Speaker 2>But that's an ethic of limitation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't seem to be very compelling.</v>

239
00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:29.983
<v Speaker 2>It isn't exactly clear what that means </v>
<v Speaker 2>as you play your future out over the </v>

240
00:12:34.011 --> 00:12:35.210
<v Speaker 2>shorter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>medium term.</v>

241
00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:40.860
<v Speaker 1>So it's interesting that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

242
00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:42.433
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this because in some ways </v>

243
00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:48.400
<v Speaker 1>environmentalist was long than most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

244
00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:49.950
<v Speaker 1>crucial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

245
00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:51.530
<v Speaker 1>developments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

246
00:12:51.531 --> 00:12:54.210
<v Speaker 1>and the history of ideas and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

247
00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:57.860
<v Speaker 1>and it was born out of recognition that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

248
00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:00.770
<v Speaker 1>to pursue growth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

249
00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:03.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without any annual limitations,</v>

250
00:13:03.621 --> 00:13:05.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can be distracted,</v>

251
00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:07.340
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

252
00:13:07.341 --> 00:13:08.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to our sense of wellbeing.</v>

253
00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:10.163
<v Speaker 1>At the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One could suggest that ever mentalism </v>

254
00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:15.980
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

255
00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:17.560
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

256
00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.600
<v Speaker 1>instrumental in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

257
00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:23.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

258
00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:26.180
<v Speaker 1>killing off the idea of progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

259
00:13:26.181 --> 00:13:27.200
<v Speaker 1>even though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

260
00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:28.063
<v Speaker 1>most people who I run into this with </v>
<v Speaker 1>gladly defined themselves as </v>

261
00:13:30.951 --> 00:13:33.290
<v Speaker 1>progressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

262
00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:35.550
<v Speaker 1>do you agree that that kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanism,</v>

263
00:13:35.551 --> 00:13:36.384
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

264
00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:37.830
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

265
00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:38.693
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

266
00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:44.240
<v Speaker 1>responsible for demise of a progressive </v>
<v Speaker 1>attitude to us history?</v>

267
00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:47.351
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

268
00:13:47.351 --> 00:13:48.710
<v Speaker 2>I think it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

269
00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:51.410
<v Speaker 2>it's a very complicated question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

270
00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:55.040
<v Speaker 2>I would say from a mythological </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>

271
00:13:55.041 --> 00:13:55.874
<v Speaker 2>we'd gone from worshiping the great </v>
<v Speaker 2>father to starting to worship the great </v>

272
00:13:59.331 --> 00:14:02.240
<v Speaker 2>mother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the great mother being something</v>

273
00:14:02.241 --> 00:14:03.440
<v Speaker 2>like die out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

274
00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:07.130
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hypothetical planetary,</v>

275
00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:10.910
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the integrated planetary system that has</v>

276
00:14:10.911 --> 00:14:14.690
<v Speaker 2>been positive as functional by a number </v>
<v Speaker 2>of biologists.</v>

277
00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:17.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gaya was actually named after,</v>

278
00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:19.550
<v Speaker 2>I think a Greek goddess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

279
00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:21.973
<v Speaker 2>when we were worshiping the great father</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's more like the classical </v>

280
00:14:24.321 --> 00:14:26.540
<v Speaker 2>patriarchy that the feminists talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

281
00:14:26.541 --> 00:14:27.374
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would say that the patriarchy was </v>

282
00:14:30.771 --> 00:14:32.930
<v Speaker 2>concerned with things like domination </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

283
00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:36.710
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a mastery mastery.</v>

284
00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:37.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

285
00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:40.810
<v Speaker 2>And that's where the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the eye,</v>

286
00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:45.940
<v Speaker 2>the sub idea there is something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>nature is the chaotic enemy and it's,</v>

287
00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:48.860
<v Speaker 2>it has to be overcome and mastered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

288
00:14:48.861 --> 00:14:53.861
<v Speaker 2>when you reverse that you get no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the patriarchal military industrial</v>

289
00:14:54.201 --> 00:14:54.860
<v Speaker 2>complex.</v>

290
00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:58.940
<v Speaker 2>That's the villain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then Mother Nature is the soft nurturing</v>

291
00:14:58.941 --> 00:15:03.040
<v Speaker 2>force that stands underneath us that </v>
<v Speaker 2>demands respect and thing is,</v>

292
00:15:03.041 --> 00:15:03.874
<v Speaker 2>is both those stories are true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even though they lead to opposite </v>

293
00:15:06.951 --> 00:15:10.280
<v Speaker 2>conclusions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're both true strangely enough.</v>

294
00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:11.263
<v Speaker 2>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>opposite things aren't supposed to be </v>

295
00:15:13.041 --> 00:15:16.670
<v Speaker 2>true simultaneously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but life is paradoxical.</v>

296
00:15:16.671 --> 00:15:19.520
<v Speaker 2>So they often are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the question is,</v>

297
00:15:19.521 --> 00:15:20.354
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens when you start to worship </v>

298
00:15:21.381 --> 00:15:22.214
<v Speaker 2>the great mother?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get more concerned with </v>

299
00:15:23.571 --> 00:15:26.180
<v Speaker 2>egalitarianism and distribution of </v>
<v Speaker 2>wealth.</v>

300
00:15:26.181 --> 00:15:27.014
<v Speaker 2>I suppose that's part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can think of that as as a </v>

301
00:15:29.631 --> 00:15:30.464
<v Speaker 2>potential ethos for the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we are making progress in that </v>

302
00:15:33.201 --> 00:15:38.201
<v Speaker 2>direction because there are far fewer </v>
<v Speaker 2>people in poverty as a percentage of the</v>

303
00:15:38.661 --> 00:15:39.494
<v Speaker 2>number of people that were alive then </v>
<v Speaker 2>there were 20 years ago and it looks </v>

304
00:15:42.261 --> 00:15:44.420
<v Speaker 2>like that's going to continue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

305
00:15:44.421 --> 00:15:45.254
<v Speaker 2>it needs the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these documents that are emanating from </v>

306
00:15:47.091 --> 00:15:47.924
<v Speaker 2>the UN that talk about the future </v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly have poverty reduction as a </v>

307
00:15:52.791 --> 00:15:53.624
<v Speaker 2>very high on their list of priorities as</v>
<v Speaker 2>well as whatever environmental concerns </v>

308
00:15:57.561 --> 00:15:59.180
<v Speaker 2>are also outlined in the documents.</v>

309
00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:01.640
<v Speaker 2>So the vision seems to be something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

310
00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:06.590
<v Speaker 2>well more attention to the conditions </v>
<v Speaker 2>under which flourishing as possible.</v>

311
00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:07.963
<v Speaker 2>So don't destroy the ecosystems that </v>
<v Speaker 2>support us but also maintain the </v>

312
00:16:13.011 --> 00:16:17.780
<v Speaker 2>possibility of lifting the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 2>humanity out of squalor.</v>

313
00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:21.920
<v Speaker 2>Those two things might be mutually </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessary because you know,</v>

314
00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:23.083
<v Speaker 2>it's people at the bottom of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>socioeconomic hierarchy that are forced </v>

315
00:16:25.941 --> 00:16:28.470
<v Speaker 2>to do things like slash and burn </v>
<v Speaker 2>agriculture and,</v>

316
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.760
<v Speaker 2>and the burning of wood for heat and </v>
<v Speaker 2>cooking.</v>

317
00:16:31.761 --> 00:16:32.594
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are heavily greenhouse gas </v>

318
00:16:34.911 --> 00:16:37.790
<v Speaker 2>emitting processes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

319
00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:42.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've come to believe that the,</v>

320
00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:43.933
<v Speaker 2>the answer to the problem of the future </v>
<v Speaker 2>is actually something that manifests </v>

321
00:16:48.501 --> 00:16:51.800
<v Speaker 2>itself more at a personal level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

322
00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:53.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might say,</v>

323
00:16:53.001 --> 00:16:54.830
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what should you do in order to,</v>

324
00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:56.593
<v Speaker 2>to make the future better?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think those answers kind of </v>

325
00:16:59.481 --> 00:17:00.650
<v Speaker 2>beckoned in front of you.</v>

326
00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:01.603
<v Speaker 2>What I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I've tried to teach my students is </v>

327
00:17:02.871 --> 00:17:06.920
<v Speaker 2>to try to make the quality of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediate experience better.</v>

328
00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:11.510
<v Speaker 2>And because I think that that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that has cascading properties.</v>

329
00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:12.763
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in our first conversation we talked </v>

330
00:17:14.211 --> 00:17:16.040
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

331
00:17:16.041 --> 00:17:20.110
<v Speaker 2>making one room in your house beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's,</v>

332
00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:23.060
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to make something beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you do it even locally,</v>

333
00:17:23.061 --> 00:17:26.420
<v Speaker 2>you learn something from that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you could make something local,</v>

334
00:17:26.421 --> 00:17:27.254
<v Speaker 2>beautiful and perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it gives you some ideas about how </v>

335
00:17:29.541 --> 00:17:30.374
<v Speaker 2>to do it on a slightly larger scale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And maybe it also gives you some </v>

336
00:17:34.071 --> 00:17:34.904
<v Speaker 2>motivation to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then if you can do it on a slightly </v>

337
00:17:37.101 --> 00:17:37.934
<v Speaker 2>larger scale,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well then you have some idea about how </v>

338
00:17:39.321 --> 00:17:41.840
<v Speaker 2>you might even do it at a slightly </v>
<v Speaker 2>larger scale.</v>

339
00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:43.623
<v Speaker 2>The guys we were down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went down to to New York on Friday to </v>

340
00:17:47.631 --> 00:17:50.280
<v Speaker 2>talk about ideas of sustainable </v>
<v Speaker 2>development.</v>

341
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.650
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that was really </v>
<v Speaker 2>stressed,</v>

342
00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:56.910
<v Speaker 2>the group had brought a bunch of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>into act as critics of their ideas.</v>

343
00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:58.343
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that was discussed</v>
<v Speaker 2>continuously by the critics was the </v>

344
00:18:03.031 --> 00:18:03.864
<v Speaker 2>importance of producing micro projects </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are designed to make things better </v>

345
00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:08.993
<v Speaker 2>and scale them up rather than trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>come up with a utopian vision from the </v>

346
00:18:12.781 --> 00:18:13.614
<v Speaker 2>top and force it down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's something about that that </v>

347
00:18:17.551 --> 00:18:18.670
<v Speaker 2>seems right to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

348
00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:22.050
<v Speaker 2>and I think it's something that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>can engage in as individuals.</v>

349
00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:25.980
<v Speaker 2>Start a micro project to make things </v>
<v Speaker 2>better around you.</v>

350
00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:27.420
<v Speaker 2>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

351
00:18:27.421 --> 00:18:32.421
<v Speaker 2>at what scale and answer to that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever scale you can actually manage.</v>

352
00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:34.733
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for some of my students that meant if </v>

353
00:18:37.891 --> 00:18:39.780
<v Speaker 2>they were in fractured families for </v>
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>

354
00:18:39.781 --> 00:18:40.614
<v Speaker 2>which was frequently the case or a </v>
<v Speaker 2>number one student who took on the </v>

355
00:18:42.571 --> 00:18:47.530
<v Speaker 2>project of buying groceries for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>family and trying to organize their meal</v>

356
00:18:47.531 --> 00:18:48.364
<v Speaker 2>times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which turned out to be a way more </v>

357
00:18:50.491 --> 00:18:52.260
<v Speaker 2>difficult thing than he had envisioned.</v>

358
00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:55.680
<v Speaker 2>He wrote about it as he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as he took on the responsibility,</v>

359
00:18:56.370 --> 00:19:01.370
<v Speaker 2>but I think our best bet off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really do believe our best bet and and</v>

360
00:19:01.621 --> 00:19:06.240
<v Speaker 2>the way forward in the future is to look</v>
<v Speaker 2>around in front of you in your immediate</v>

361
00:19:06.241 --> 00:19:09.990
<v Speaker 2>environment and to try to make it </v>
<v Speaker 2>balanced and healthy.</v>

362
00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:11.273
<v Speaker 2>And I think the cumulative consequences </v>
<v Speaker 2>of that will be that everything is </v>

363
00:19:13.681 --> 00:19:18.450
<v Speaker 2>balanced and healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things we talked about at the</v>

364
00:19:18.451 --> 00:19:22.730
<v Speaker 2>meeting was you know the intuition of </v>
<v Speaker 2>beauty because they don't think the,</v>

365
00:19:22.731 --> 00:19:23.460
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

366
00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:25.860
<v Speaker 2>the apprehension of beauty is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>something rational.</v>

367
00:19:25.861 --> 00:19:27.630
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's outside rationality.</v>

368
00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:29.513
<v Speaker 2>But the apprehension of beauty is </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that that help can help guide </v>

369
00:19:32.821 --> 00:19:37.821
<v Speaker 2>us to construct environments that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>maximally beneficial I think.</v>

370
00:19:38.191 --> 00:19:39.550
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what the sense of beauty </v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

371
00:19:39.551 --> 00:19:40.384
<v Speaker 2>Therefore,</v>

372
00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:46.260
<v Speaker 1>also about the recognition of the beauty</v>
<v Speaker 1>of being present here and now.</v>

373
00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:47.850
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

374
00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:49.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some ways a,</v>

375
00:19:49.871 --> 00:19:53.320
<v Speaker 1>this avoids the dilemma of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

376
00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:54.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

377
00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:55.763
<v Speaker 1>imagining that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we need to entrust ourselves to a </v>

378
00:19:58.591 --> 00:19:59.670
<v Speaker 1>idealized future.</v>

379
00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:01.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I think,</v>

380
00:20:01.071 --> 00:20:01.904
<v Speaker 2>I think if something's beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think partly what that means is that </v>

381
00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:10.070
<v Speaker 2>the ideal future is embedded in it </v>
<v Speaker 2>already.</v>

382
00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:13.860
<v Speaker 2>And that's why it's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

383
00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:15.960
<v Speaker 2>the future is a tricky thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

384
00:20:15.961 --> 00:20:18.510
<v Speaker 2>and so are the things around us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

385
00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:21.750
<v Speaker 2>everything around us contains what it is</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the present,</v>

386
00:20:21.751 --> 00:20:22.584
<v Speaker 2>but it also contains the possibility of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the multiple things it could be in the </v>

387
00:20:25.351 --> 00:20:26.184
<v Speaker 2>future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that when you apprehend </v>

388
00:20:28.141 --> 00:20:31.140
<v Speaker 2>something that's beautiful or when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>construct something that's beautiful,</v>

389
00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:32.303
<v Speaker 2>you're also constructing something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>has the kind of future you would most </v>

390
00:20:36.301 --> 00:20:38.490
<v Speaker 2>want to like in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

391
00:20:38.491 --> 00:20:42.270
<v Speaker 2>I can give you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can give you a brief example of that.</v>

392
00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:43.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Europe,</v>

393
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:48.350
<v Speaker 2>the Europeans spent centuries trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make their,</v>

394
00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:53.700
<v Speaker 2>their cities and the buildings in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful far more than we've,</v>

395
00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:55.243
<v Speaker 2>they've paid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>paid far more attention to that than we </v>

396
00:20:56.681 --> 00:20:59.560
<v Speaker 2>do in the West or in North America </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyways.</v>

397
00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:04.960
<v Speaker 2>And the consequence of that is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone flocks to Europe to see the old</v>

398
00:21:04.961 --> 00:21:08.130
<v Speaker 2>cities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something about those old cities</v>

399
00:21:08.131 --> 00:21:10.080
<v Speaker 2>that's right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beautiful.</v>

400
00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:13.430
<v Speaker 1>And yet you have to be right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And being from,</v>

401
00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:14.900
<v Speaker 1>from Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

402
00:21:14.901 --> 00:21:17.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I obviously grew up in,</v>

403
00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:18.403
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

404
00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:22.710
<v Speaker 1>in May,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a number of cities in Europe and,</v>

405
00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:25.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and every time I go back to you,</v>

406
00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:26.593
<v Speaker 1>I must say that I'm troubled by the fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>that many of the cities are precisely </v>

407
00:21:33.471 --> 00:21:36.770
<v Speaker 1>that they are beautiful and nothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

408
00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:39.230
<v Speaker 1>It should be done to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

409
00:21:39.530 --> 00:21:43.220
<v Speaker 1>to enhance the beauty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They as beautiful as they as they can be</v>

410
00:21:43.221 --> 00:21:46.320
<v Speaker 1>in with talking about Paris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>superrich Rome,</v>

411
00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:47.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>garth in Burke,</v>

412
00:21:47.711 --> 00:21:49.040
<v Speaker 1>Stockholm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

413
00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:49.903
<v Speaker 1>pick any of those cities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you'd be hard pressed to </v>

414
00:21:54.051 --> 00:21:57.740
<v Speaker 1>imagine what else needs to be done to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make them better.</v>

415
00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:02.010
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that is in itself a problem,</v>

416
00:22:02.011 --> 00:22:02.844
<v Speaker 1>a problem precisely caused by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>question that we are discussing here </v>

417
00:22:07.411 --> 00:22:09.970
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is there,</v>

418
00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:14.990
<v Speaker 1>there the city is no longer have a need </v>
<v Speaker 1>for future and,</v>

419
00:22:15.781 --> 00:22:18.480
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't have that need,</v>

420
00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:21.910
<v Speaker 1>then you are stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are stuck and,</v>

421
00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:26.380
<v Speaker 1>and you are frozen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we don't know.</v>

422
00:22:26.381 --> 00:22:28.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we know what to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

423
00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:30.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

424
00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:34.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I understand what you're saying.</v>

425
00:22:34.441 --> 00:22:36.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of those cities have become sort of</v>

426
00:22:36.691 --> 00:22:37.524
<v Speaker 2>living museums because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although I guess maybe in some ways </v>

427
00:22:40.321 --> 00:22:41.154
<v Speaker 2>that's not such a bad destani given the </v>
<v Speaker 2>number of people around the world who </v>

428
00:22:44.251 --> 00:22:45.084
<v Speaker 2>are going to want to travel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's certainly no shortage of </v>

429
00:22:47.431 --> 00:22:50.880
<v Speaker 2>beautification that could be done in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world's remaining cities.</v>

430
00:22:50.881 --> 00:22:53.910
<v Speaker 2>And I think that also speaks to </v>
<v Speaker 2>environmental concerns.</v>

431
00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:54.773
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read some books a while ago about </v>

432
00:22:56.521 --> 00:22:57.354
<v Speaker 2>Chesapeake Bay before the Europeans came</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Chesapeake Bay was one of the </v>

433
00:23:01.541 --> 00:23:05.620
<v Speaker 2>richest natural environments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that ever existed on the planet.</v>

434
00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:10.420
<v Speaker 2>And what's striking about the writings </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the original Chesapeake Bay is the</v>

435
00:23:10.421 --> 00:23:12.820
<v Speaker 2>description of their natural beauty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

436
00:23:12.821 --> 00:23:14.440
<v Speaker 2>it's enough to make you weep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

437
00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:19.660
<v Speaker 2>it's enough to make you weak to realize </v>
<v Speaker 2>how productive than and remarkable those</v>

438
00:23:20.111 --> 00:23:22.590
<v Speaker 2>ecosystems once were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>

439
00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:24.670
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that those,</v>

440
00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:26.433
<v Speaker 2>those places are gone increasingly gone </v>
<v Speaker 2>is reflected most particularly in a </v>

441
00:23:31.111 --> 00:23:31.944
<v Speaker 2>decrease in the beauty of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's I think a direction for the </v>

442
00:23:37.291 --> 00:23:39.480
<v Speaker 2>future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What kind of world do we want?</v>

443
00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:40.523
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be lovely to have a world that </v>

444
00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:43.863
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is unimaginably beautiful and that's </v>

445
00:23:46.491 --> 00:23:50.180
<v Speaker 2>something that people could work towards</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can do that locally and it,</v>

446
00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:55.490
<v Speaker 1>but in some way sustainability has </v>
<v Speaker 1>become persaya precisely the response to</v>

447
00:23:55.491 --> 00:23:59.330
<v Speaker 1>the idea of progress that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's no longer a question of,</v>

448
00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:00.193
<v Speaker 1>of how to eh change and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and create a database says never just </v>

449
00:24:05.571 --> 00:24:09.260
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but precisely to be able to,</v>

450
00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:11.600
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

451
00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:16.630
<v Speaker 1>retained and protect the threat.</v>

452
00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:20.680
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that the idea of sustainability,</v>

453
00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:21.753
<v Speaker 2>I think it's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is something that came up in the </v>

454
00:24:23.891 --> 00:24:28.030
<v Speaker 2>discussions in New York too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that sustainability is,</v>

455
00:24:28.031 --> 00:24:31.920
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of a vow shall not ethic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

456
00:24:31.921 --> 00:24:32.754
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings have raped and pillaged </v>

457
00:24:33.931 --> 00:24:38.931
<v Speaker 2>long enough and it's time for us to </v>
<v Speaker 2>start limiting our appetites so that you</v>

458
00:24:39.131 --> 00:24:40.990
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other things beside us,</v>

459
00:24:40.991 --> 00:24:43.990
<v Speaker 2>which also have rights can flourish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

460
00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:44.830
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that isn't,</v>

461
00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:47.390
<v Speaker 2>that isn't what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that isn't what I'm talking about.</v>

462
00:24:47.391 --> 00:24:50.020
<v Speaker 2>And the reason I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason for that is I think that's,</v>

463
00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:53.710
<v Speaker 2>I think that that's built on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally antihistamine.</v>

464
00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:56.310
<v Speaker 2>MMM,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

465
00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:59.870
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>An anti human mythology.</v>

466
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:01.063
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of like the state of being </v>

467
00:25:03.771 --> 00:25:05.390
<v Speaker 2>before Noah's flood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

468
00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:06.613
<v Speaker 2>human beings are evil and sinful and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're running around making too much </v>

469
00:25:09.381 --> 00:25:10.214
<v Speaker 2>noise and the best thing to happen would</v>
<v Speaker 2>be that nature could come back and wash </v>

470
00:25:14.121 --> 00:25:14.954
<v Speaker 2>us all the way with the flood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we should be careful and scaled back </v>

471
00:25:17.931 --> 00:25:21.360
<v Speaker 2>and be good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think,</v>

472
00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:26.480
<v Speaker 2>like people aren't built to live inside </v>
<v Speaker 2>limits like that.</v>

473
00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:31.430
<v Speaker 2>W that isn't because our central </v>
<v Speaker 2>mythologies are hero mythologies.</v>

474
00:25:31.431 --> 00:25:34.520
<v Speaker 2>There are about going out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>transforming chaos into order.</v>

475
00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:36.500
<v Speaker 2>They're not about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

476
00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:41.030
<v Speaker 2>being guilty about who we are and having</v>
<v Speaker 2>to live inside a fence for the safety of</v>

477
00:25:41.031 --> 00:25:41.870
<v Speaker 2>everything else.</v>

478
00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:43.233
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet any of match a match how the </v>

479
00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:47.860
<v Speaker 1>ethos is precisely about that.</v>

480
00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:50.280
<v Speaker 2>Well that's why you don't trust it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

481
00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:52.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a psychoanalyst,</v>

482
00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:56.550
<v Speaker 2>whenever anybody ever pause,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a good,</v>

483
00:25:56.551 --> 00:25:58.650
<v Speaker 2>I always wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

484
00:25:58.651 --> 00:25:59.484
<v Speaker 2>what the downside to what their positing</v>
<v Speaker 2>is and what the negative motivations </v>

485
00:26:02.251 --> 00:26:03.960
<v Speaker 2>might be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've met plenty.</v>

486
00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:04.853
<v Speaker 2>I've met plenty of environment metalists</v>
<v Speaker 2>and heard from many more who clearly </v>

487
00:26:08.251 --> 00:26:09.084
<v Speaker 2>don't like people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard a professor at Queen's </v>

488
00:26:11.731 --> 00:26:14.070
<v Speaker 2>university when I was there doing a Tedx</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk.</v>

489
00:26:14.071 --> 00:26:14.904
<v Speaker 2>It was one of the most appalling things </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've ever heard in my life is this guy </v>

490
00:26:17.641 --> 00:26:19.140
<v Speaker 2>came out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

491
00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:20.903
<v Speaker 2>and he used the Tedx talk as a forum to </v>
<v Speaker 2>harangue all the 18 and 19 year olds in </v>

492
00:26:24.991 --> 00:26:26.990
<v Speaker 2>the audience about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

493
00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.400
<v Speaker 2>the essential evilness of humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His decision to,</v>

494
00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:31.333
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you only had one child on his </v>

495
00:26:33.451 --> 00:26:38.451
<v Speaker 2>decision to limit as repor duction and </v>
<v Speaker 2>his strong emphasis on the immorality of</v>

496
00:26:39.481 --> 00:26:41.070
<v Speaker 2>them doing anything but that.</v>

497
00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:44.640
<v Speaker 2>So he's out there talking to all 18 and </v>
<v Speaker 2>19 year old kids.</v>

498
00:26:44.641 --> 00:26:46.800
<v Speaker 2>In his basic attitude was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

499
00:26:46.801 --> 00:26:47.634
<v Speaker 2>human beings are so awful that the only </v>
<v Speaker 2>moral thing you can do as young people </v>

500
00:26:51.531 --> 00:26:55.490
<v Speaker 2>is to make bloody sure you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>replicate too many of yourselves.</v>

501
00:26:56.050 --> 00:26:56.900
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>

502
00:26:56.901 --> 00:26:58.820
<v Speaker 2>I didn't trust that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

503
00:26:58.840 --> 00:26:59.673
<v Speaker 2>I think I thought he was profoundly and </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerously anti human and a lot of the </v>

504
00:27:05.721 --> 00:27:09.170
<v Speaker 2>rhetoric that drives the </v>
<v Speaker 2>environmentalist movement is resentful,</v>

505
00:27:09.171 --> 00:27:12.300
<v Speaker 2>anti humanism and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's no,</v>

506
00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:13.163
<v Speaker 2>that's not the kind of thing that can </v>
<v Speaker 2>guide the development of a positive </v>

507
00:27:16.411 --> 00:27:18.090
<v Speaker 2>future if that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

508
00:27:18.091 --> 00:27:18.924
<v Speaker 2>I've heard environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say things like the planet would </v>

509
00:27:21.631 --> 00:27:22.464
<v Speaker 2>be better off if people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there were no people on it or human </v>

510
00:27:25.471 --> 00:27:27.300
<v Speaker 2>beings are like a cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

511
00:27:27.301 --> 00:27:30.000
<v Speaker 2>sorry buddy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not taking any guidelines from you.</v>

512
00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:34.770
<v Speaker 2>That to me that sort of ethos is one </v>
<v Speaker 2>step away from genocidal thinking.</v>

513
00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:37.470
<v Speaker 2>I really mean that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

514
00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:41.060
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hatred for humanity under the guise</v>

515
00:27:41.061 --> 00:27:43.070
<v Speaker 2>of love of mother nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

516
00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:46.700
<v Speaker 2>I think the same thing about a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the animal rights guys who want to,</v>

517
00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:47.553
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give rats the same rights as people is </v>

518
00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:50.953
<v Speaker 2>they want nothing to have rights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't rat want wraps to have the </v>

519
00:27:53.751 --> 00:27:57.110
<v Speaker 2>rights of people there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very dangerous and,</v>

520
00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:58.353
<v Speaker 1>and yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet and yet for all fall on the </v>

521
00:27:59.711 --> 00:28:00.850
<v Speaker 1>critical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

522
00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:06.120
<v Speaker 1>notions that you bring to the a and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentalist cause and those who,</v>

523
00:28:06.761 --> 00:28:07.594
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who exhibited in the bureau and fashion </v>

524
00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:15.590
<v Speaker 1>yourself have a later became quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned with aspects of incremental,</v>

525
00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:21.330
<v Speaker 1>a distraction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you've given a talk about it,</v>

526
00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:23.440
<v Speaker 1>about the need to rescue our oceans.</v>

527
00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:24.713
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's pretty soon that talk will </v>

528
00:28:29.041 --> 00:28:31.320
<v Speaker 2>be online pretty soon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

529
00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:32.483
<v Speaker 2>I got invited to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to help work on a UN document a few </v>

530
00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:37.253
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was the Secretary Generals High </v>

531
00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:42.450
<v Speaker 2>Level Panel on global sustainability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that was the name of it.</v>

532
00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:44.940
<v Speaker 2>It's got an awkward title so it escapes </v>
<v Speaker 2>my mind.</v>

533
00:28:44.941 --> 00:28:49.470
<v Speaker 2>But I was invited by the Canadian who </v>
<v Speaker 2>sat on the committee because he believed</v>

534
00:28:49.471 --> 00:28:50.400
<v Speaker 2>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

535
00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:55.620
<v Speaker 2>underlying narrative of the UN document </v>
<v Speaker 2>was outdated and inappropriate.</v>

536
00:28:55.621 --> 00:28:59.160
<v Speaker 2>And it was outdated because it was still</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of a cold war document.</v>

537
00:28:59.610 --> 00:29:03.520
<v Speaker 2>There was still a lot of north versus </v>
<v Speaker 2>south in at and a lot of,</v>

538
00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:04.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

539
00:29:04.951 --> 00:29:09.951
<v Speaker 2>capitalism versus socialism slash </v>
<v Speaker 2>communism and you know,</v>

540
00:29:11.211 --> 00:29:12.044
<v Speaker 2>it was 40 years out of date.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Plus it was far too pessimistic about </v>

541
00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:18.840
<v Speaker 2>the progress that human beings have made</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the last 30 years.</v>

542
00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:20.213
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it didn't take into account the fact </v>

543
00:29:21.211 --> 00:29:25.080
<v Speaker 2>that there aren't very many dictators </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore and that way fewer people are in</v>

544
00:29:25.081 --> 00:29:25.914
<v Speaker 2>poverty and that we've made a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>progress in getting rid of terrible </v>

545
00:29:28.621 --> 00:29:30.750
<v Speaker 2>communicable diseases and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

546
00:29:30.751 --> 00:29:31.584
<v Speaker 2>there are 7 billion of us and hardly </v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody starving and our population has </v>

547
00:29:35.761 --> 00:29:39.270
<v Speaker 2>done to level off at 9,000,000,008</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then start to decline.</v>

548
00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:40.103
<v Speaker 2>So we're in a bottleneck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we might be able to get through it </v>

549
00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:45.610
<v Speaker 2>anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While I was working on that document and</v>

550
00:29:45.611 --> 00:29:47.590
<v Speaker 2>trying to clean up the underlying </v>
<v Speaker 2>narratives,</v>

551
00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:49.990
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make it more balanced.</v>

552
00:29:49.991 --> 00:29:54.490
<v Speaker 2>And I wouldn't say more optimistic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but less anti-human,</v>

553
00:29:54.610 --> 00:29:55.443
<v Speaker 2>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did a lot of reading about the </v>

554
00:29:58.091 --> 00:30:00.340
<v Speaker 2>ecological condition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>

555
00:30:00.341 --> 00:30:01.174
<v Speaker 2>And you know about global warming and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of thing and pretty much </v>

556
00:30:04.211 --> 00:30:05.044
<v Speaker 2>everything I could get my hands on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I read a lot of books on the state </v>

557
00:30:08.021 --> 00:30:10.030
<v Speaker 2>of the ocean and they were really </v>
<v Speaker 2>depressing.</v>

558
00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:11.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are really,</v>

559
00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:15.520
<v Speaker 2>really destroying the oceans and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not good.</v>

560
00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:17.073
<v Speaker 2>And it's not because I'm an </v>
<v Speaker 2>environmentalist that I say that's not </v>

561
00:30:19.151 --> 00:30:19.984
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because anybody with any sense can </v>

562
00:30:22.001 --> 00:30:22.834
<v Speaker 2>see that the loss of the beauty and </v>
<v Speaker 2>dynamism of the oceans would make the </v>

563
00:30:25.541 --> 00:30:29.410
<v Speaker 2>world a less good place to live in for </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

564
00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:30.663
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just for the creatures that are in </v>

565
00:30:31.721 --> 00:30:32.554
<v Speaker 2>the sea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you really want to live in a ocean </v>

566
00:30:34.661 --> 00:30:37.270
<v Speaker 2>that's full of nothing but jellyfish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

567
00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:38.253
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jelly fish don't like human beings very </v>

568
00:30:39.821 --> 00:30:40.780
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there's too many,</v>

569
00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:41.943
<v Speaker 2>too many of them around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to be doing a lot of </v>

570
00:30:43.091 --> 00:30:46.860
<v Speaker 2>swimming in the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

571
00:30:46.861 --> 00:30:49.720
<v Speaker 2>I was reading this week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

572
00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:52.580
<v Speaker 2>most people don't know this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

573
00:30:52.581 --> 00:30:53.414
<v Speaker 2>the ocean seems really big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but almost all the Fisher on the </v>

574
00:30:56.061 --> 00:31:00.200
<v Speaker 2>continental shelf and the continental </v>
<v Speaker 2>shelf forney extends a couple of hundred</v>

575
00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:02.720
<v Speaker 2>miles off the continent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why it's called the continental</v>

576
00:31:02.721 --> 00:31:03.554
<v Speaker 2>shelf.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it isn't that big an area and </v>

577
00:31:05.921 --> 00:31:08.020
<v Speaker 2>that's where all the fish are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

578
00:31:08.021 --> 00:31:13.021
<v Speaker 2>right now we trawl the continental shelf</v>
<v Speaker 2>twice a year,</v>

579
00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:16.620
<v Speaker 2>completely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely.</v>

580
00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:21.770
<v Speaker 2>That's like mowing the continent with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lawnmower twice a year.</v>

581
00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:25.110
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

582
00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:27.000
<v Speaker 2>it's mind boggling.</v>

583
00:31:27.150 --> 00:31:29.640
<v Speaker 2>And trawlers they're there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're quite the things,</v>

584
00:31:29.641 --> 00:31:30.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they basically,</v>

585
00:31:30.841 --> 00:31:33.600
<v Speaker 2>you with a trawler,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you take a big way to net,</v>

586
00:31:33.630 --> 00:31:34.463
<v Speaker 2>like a huge way to knit and you drag it </v>
<v Speaker 2>across the ocean floor and you disturb </v>

587
00:31:39.341 --> 00:31:44.260
<v Speaker 2>the entire surface of the floor and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>raise a huge clouds of dust that,</v>

588
00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:47.910
<v Speaker 2>that pollute the water for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for even hundreds of miles around.</v>

589
00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:49.103
<v Speaker 2>And you take absolutely everything and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then you haul it up to the surface and </v>

590
00:31:53.941 --> 00:31:54.774
<v Speaker 2>then you take one 10th of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the stuff that you're allowed </v>

591
00:31:58.111 --> 00:32:00.300
<v Speaker 2>to harvest and that's commercially </v>
<v Speaker 2>viable.</v>

592
00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:04.470
<v Speaker 2>The other 90% is dead and you throw all </v>
<v Speaker 2>of that back.</v>

593
00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:07.223
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's only one of 50 stories about </v>

594
00:32:11.341 --> 00:32:14.280
<v Speaker 2>ocean degradation that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>easily come to mind.</v>

595
00:32:14.281 --> 00:32:15.114
<v Speaker 2>So I think that's terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I also think that our obsessive </v>

596
00:32:18.151 --> 00:32:20.820
<v Speaker 2>concern with global warming is blinding </v>
<v Speaker 2>us to,</v>

597
00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:22.163
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ecological catastrophes that are much </v>

598
00:32:24.181 --> 00:32:27.180
<v Speaker 2>more at hand and that would actually be </v>
<v Speaker 2>more solvable.</v>

599
00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:29.280
<v Speaker 2>At least something could be done about </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

600
00:32:29.850 --> 00:32:30.683
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

601
00:32:31.390 --> 00:32:36.390
<v Speaker 1>so we are almost 10 yet again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to summarize,</v>

602
00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:37.630
<v Speaker 1>it's a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

603
00:32:38.150 --> 00:32:39.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

604
00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:40.513
<v Speaker 1>so we obviously the profound needs that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we recognize I have to do with the </v>

605
00:32:44.751 --> 00:32:46.700
<v Speaker 1>damage that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

606
00:32:46.701 --> 00:32:48.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a thoughtless,</v>

607
00:32:48.951 --> 00:32:50.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

608
00:32:50.450 --> 00:32:55.100
<v Speaker 1>advancement of technology and </v>
<v Speaker 1>satisfaction of human needs as broad.</v>

609
00:32:55.650 --> 00:32:57.130
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

610
00:32:57.131 --> 00:32:57.964
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously you feel powerfully about </v>

611
00:32:59.561 --> 00:33:00.394
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

612
00:33:00.490 --> 00:33:02.200
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as regards to the oceans,</v>

613
00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:02.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

614
00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:05.660
<v Speaker 2>I feel powerful you about it when it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>done stupidly.</v>

615
00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:07.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

616
00:33:07.581 --> 00:33:10.520
<v Speaker 2>if you have a crop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have a herd of cows,</v>

617
00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:15.200
<v Speaker 2>you don't shoot every one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

618
00:33:16.670 --> 00:33:18.530
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not good for you.</v>

619
00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:20.270
<v Speaker 2>It's not good for the cows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously,</v>

620
00:33:20.271 --> 00:33:22.310
<v Speaker 2>but it's really not good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it isn't,</v>

621
00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:23.773
<v Speaker 2>it isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it isn't even the sacrifice of natural </v>

622
00:33:26.421 --> 00:33:28.850
<v Speaker 2>resources to the advancement of human </v>
<v Speaker 2>beings.</v>

623
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:29.833
<v Speaker 2>That concerns me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the fact that a lot of it's being </v>

624
00:33:32.271 --> 00:33:35.690
<v Speaker 2>done in a way that is clearly have no </v>
<v Speaker 2>benefit to anyone.</v>

625
00:33:35.770 --> 00:33:36.603
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wasteful.</v>

626
00:33:36.790 --> 00:33:37.860
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

627
00:33:37.910 --> 00:33:38.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

628
00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:39.863
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

629
00:33:40.210 --> 00:33:41.620
<v Speaker 1>the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the question that,</v>

630
00:33:41.670 --> 00:33:44.190
<v Speaker 1>that we're trying to address here is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

631
00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:45.660
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

632
00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:49.430
<v Speaker 1>how to think about the future and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

633
00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:50.283
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not we can draw some solace </v>

634
00:33:53.770 --> 00:33:55.400
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

635
00:33:55.450 --> 00:33:58.540
<v Speaker 1>some notions about what the future can </v>
<v Speaker 1>be to,</v>

636
00:33:58.660 --> 00:33:59.241
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

637
00:33:59.241 --> 00:34:00.810
<v Speaker 1>to deal with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the,</v>

638
00:34:00.811 --> 00:34:02.420
<v Speaker 1>the question of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

639
00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:04.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of social meaning,</v>

640
00:34:04.871 --> 00:34:09.871
<v Speaker 1>because history was very much about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about offering us as a,</v>

641
00:34:10.181 --> 00:34:10.971
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>

642
00:34:10.971 --> 00:34:12.450
<v Speaker 1>as a mankind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mankind,</v>

643
00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:13.720
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>

644
00:34:13.721 --> 00:34:18.430
<v Speaker 1>as a collectivity Sam frame within which</v>
<v Speaker 1>to think about the past,</v>

645
00:34:18.431 --> 00:34:20.170
<v Speaker 1>present,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then tomorrow.</v>

646
00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:25.630
<v Speaker 1>And the question is whether or not that </v>
<v Speaker 1>frame,</v>

647
00:34:25.660 --> 00:34:26.493
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's available to us without that </v>

648
00:34:28.541 --> 00:34:33.490
<v Speaker 1>timeframe is available to us that allows</v>
<v Speaker 1>us to bookend our existence.</v>

649
00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:38.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I said,</v>

650
00:34:38.511 --> 00:34:39.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after,</v>

651
00:34:39.491 --> 00:34:42.050
<v Speaker 2>after many years of thinking about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

652
00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:43.530
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

653
00:34:43.870 --> 00:34:46.930
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got kind of radically local in my,</v>

654
00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:47.793
<v Speaker 2>in my thinking I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I became so disenchanted with </v>

655
00:34:50.411 --> 00:34:54.370
<v Speaker 2>large scale political solutions to </v>
<v Speaker 2>things because of the dangers associated</v>

656
00:34:54.371 --> 00:34:55.204
<v Speaker 2>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think the way forward is for </v>

657
00:34:57.341 --> 00:34:58.174
<v Speaker 2>people to concentrate more intently on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on their individual lives and the </v>

658
00:35:01.961 --> 00:35:06.961
<v Speaker 2>quality and integrity of those lives and</v>
<v Speaker 2>to learn what they can from Pur pursuing</v>

659
00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:08.103
<v Speaker 2>high quality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>high integrity lies and then just start </v>

660
00:35:10.571 --> 00:35:14.440
<v Speaker 2>applying that at broader scales.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a bottom up idea,</v>

661
00:35:15.250 --> 00:35:16.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it,</v>

662
00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:18.190
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>

663
00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:23.020
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the properly he humble sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of idea.</v>

664
00:35:23.021 --> 00:35:25.780
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's getting your own house in order and</v>

665
00:35:25.781 --> 00:35:26.614
<v Speaker 2>then worry about what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say even the rest of the </v>

666
00:35:28.691 --> 00:35:29.524
<v Speaker 2>world at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get your own house in order and then </v>

667
00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:32.133
<v Speaker 2>worry about your local community if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can manage that than worry about what's </v>

668
00:35:35.341 --> 00:35:36.690
<v Speaker 2>beyond your local community.</v>

669
00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:39.990
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there is rich meaning and not,</v>

670
00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:41.333
<v Speaker 2>my experience has been that there's rich</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning and not because there's </v>

671
00:35:43.291 --> 00:35:47.110
<v Speaker 2>something about setting your own house </v>
<v Speaker 2>in order that's really compelling.</v>

672
00:35:47.470 --> 00:35:49.600
<v Speaker 2>It's an adventure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a compelling adventure.</v>

673
00:35:49.601 --> 00:35:52.840
<v Speaker 2>It's also very difficult and you learn </v>
<v Speaker 2>things from doing it,</v>

674
00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:54.190
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as I said,</v>

675
00:35:54.191 --> 00:35:55.024
<v Speaker 2>I've run lots of students through this </v>
<v Speaker 2>process and they've essentially come to </v>

676
00:35:59.291 --> 00:36:02.360
<v Speaker 2>the same conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I would say the,</v>

677
00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:07.780
<v Speaker 2>the future isn't out in distant time </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

678
00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:08.943
<v Speaker 2>Like it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the future is right in front of </v>

679
00:36:11.141 --> 00:36:14.080
<v Speaker 2>us now and I mean literally right in </v>
<v Speaker 2>front of us.</v>

680
00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:16.660
<v Speaker 2>And if we improve what's right in front </v>
<v Speaker 2>of us,</v>

681
00:36:16.661 --> 00:36:21.661
<v Speaker 2>then that improvement will propagate out</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

682
00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:27.370
<v Speaker 2>Temporally and spatially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't see what are other option is</v>

683
00:36:27.371 --> 00:36:31.330
<v Speaker 2>because what are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to try to direct things 10,</v>

684
00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:33.100
<v Speaker 2>10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 years into the future.</v>

685
00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:34.173
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't even imagine what's going to be </v>

686
00:36:35.831 --> 00:36:36.664
<v Speaker 2>like them.</v>

687
00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:37.701
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

688
00:36:37.701 --> 00:36:38.534
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a key phrase for this </v>

689
00:36:43.571 --> 00:36:47.770
<v Speaker 1>conversation in the future is here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then that's the only way in which we</v>

690
00:36:47.771 --> 00:36:49.140
<v Speaker 1>can take care of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

691
00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:50.343
<v Speaker 1>thank you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jordan,</v>

694
00:36:53.291 --> 00:36:57.230

695
00:36:58.060 --> 00:37:00.580
<v Speaker 1>to work after some break.</v>
