00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:01.150
<v Speaker 1>Hello?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2
00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:02.980
<v Speaker 1>my name is Boris Chamber and we produce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3
00:00:02.981 --> 00:00:03.880
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4
00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:08.620
<v Speaker 1>the agenda at Tvo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm speaking with Jordan Peterson.</v>

5
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:14.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm a clinical psychologist and </v>
<v Speaker 1>professor of psychology at University of</v>

6
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.033
<v Speaker 1>Toronto and the security duration of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation that we started a month </v>

7
00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:19.600
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.780
<v Speaker 1>about his new project.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But your honesty project,</v>

9
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.500
<v Speaker 1>I called 42.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So reminders,</v>

10
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

11
00:00:26.631 --> 00:00:28.300
<v Speaker 1>Justin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the book is about.</v>

12
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.350
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the book,</v>

13
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.930
<v Speaker 2>I wrote a little article for an online </v>
<v Speaker 2>site.</v>

14
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.510
<v Speaker 2>He responds to questions about rules to </v>
<v Speaker 2>live by,</v>

15
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:40.463
<v Speaker 2>and the site's called Cora.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you could post any question or any </v>

16
00:00:44.041 --> 00:00:44.874
<v Speaker 2>answer on Cora.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so for awhile I was kind of </v>

17
00:00:46.981 --> 00:00:49.950
<v Speaker 2>interested in answering core questions </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I answered that one.</v>

18
00:00:49.951 --> 00:00:53.670
<v Speaker 2>I came up with a list of 42 rules,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is probably more than he bargained</v>

19
00:00:53.671 --> 00:00:54.504
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the list became my core standards </v>

20
00:00:57.421 --> 00:00:59.580
<v Speaker 2>quite popular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

21
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.073
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talked to an agent book agent that I </v>

22
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.373
<v Speaker 2>have been working with in Vancouver </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the possibility of working it up </v>

23
00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:10.290
<v Speaker 2>into a book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's,</v>

24
00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.600
<v Speaker 2>that's the origin story of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular project.</v>

25
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.250
<v Speaker 1>So last time we talked about about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

26
00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those items on your list would seem less</v>

27
00:01:21.501 --> 00:01:22.334
<v Speaker 1>than absolutely serious that to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the reasons for why it is that we need </v>

28
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.540
<v Speaker 1>to make one of our rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

29
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:30.740
<v Speaker 1>beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

30
00:01:30.741 --> 00:01:31.574
<v Speaker 1>they had to do with skateboarders and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the respect they deserve and I such </v>

31
00:01:35.961 --> 00:01:36.794
<v Speaker 1>items.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And today I would like to switch the </v>

32
00:01:39.891 --> 00:01:41.020
<v Speaker 1>gears a bit and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

33
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.470
<v Speaker 1>talk about perhaps the one item on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>list,</v>

34
00:01:45.471 --> 00:01:46.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

35
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.303
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which betrays a hint of a theme that </v>

36
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.580
<v Speaker 1>seems to be missing in the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the theme is death.</v>

37
00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.080
<v Speaker 1>And the last item on your list,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the item number 42,</v>

38
00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.650
<v Speaker 1>is be grateful in spite of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering,</v>

39
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.173
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much of that suffering that you are </v>

40
00:02:03.801 --> 00:02:07.460
<v Speaker 1>referring to has to do with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

41
00:02:07.461 --> 00:02:08.810
<v Speaker 1>inevitability of death.</v>

42
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.860
<v Speaker 2>It's broader than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in some ways.</v>

43
00:02:12.861 --> 00:02:13.231
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

44
00:02:13.231 --> 00:02:17.690
<v Speaker 2>if there's a large psychological </v>
<v Speaker 2>literature on the human terror of death,</v>

45
00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.843
<v Speaker 2>but I think that the people who think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that human beings are afraid of death </v>

46
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.973
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

47
00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.830
<v Speaker 2>are far too optimistic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

48
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.033
<v Speaker 2>We're afraid of a lot more than death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're afraid of degeneration and </v>

49
00:02:31.021 --> 00:02:36.021
<v Speaker 2>deterioration and pain and betrayal and </v>
<v Speaker 2>insanity and death.</v>

50
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.073
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could say that death is the most </v>

51
00:02:41.551 --> 00:02:42.384
<v Speaker 2>frightening of those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it isn't because otherwise people </v>

52
00:02:43.951 --> 00:02:45.030
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't commit suicide.</v>

53
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.843
<v Speaker 1>Not to the extent that that has </v>
<v Speaker 1>universal as opposed to the other items </v>

54
00:02:49.451 --> 00:02:51.680
<v Speaker 1>that you have mentioned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

55
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:52.830
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

56
00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.980
<v Speaker 1>that fair represents a kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>extension of frame that a,</v>

57
00:02:56.981 --> 00:02:58.780
<v Speaker 1>that involves all of us.</v>

58
00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.681
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>

59
00:02:59.681 --> 00:03:00.514
<v Speaker 2>I think the frame is better </v>
<v Speaker 2>conceptualized as vulnerability with </v>

60
00:03:03.761 --> 00:03:06.760
<v Speaker 2>death being a sub element of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

61
00:03:06.761 --> 00:03:10.150
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not trying to make light of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>universality of death obviously,</v>

62
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:11.223
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a broader category of problem </v>

63
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.610
<v Speaker 2>and when you're trying to address a </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem that that's,</v>

64
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:16.503
<v Speaker 2>that's that serious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very important to get the </v>

65
00:03:17.981 --> 00:03:21.430
<v Speaker 2>terminology perfectly straight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

66
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.910
<v Speaker 2>People's relationship with death is </v>
<v Speaker 2>rather ambivalent because I'm mean,</v>

67
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.903
<v Speaker 2>there are any number of documented and </v>
<v Speaker 2>continue in cases of people putting </v>

68
00:03:30.971 --> 00:03:33.250
<v Speaker 2>their lives on the line for things they </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe in.</v>

69
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:34.241
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

70
00:03:34.241 --> 00:03:35.074
<v Speaker 2>you could also make the case that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>absence of meaning is a more terrifying </v>

71
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.930
<v Speaker 2>prospect than the possibility of death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

72
00:03:43.931 --> 00:03:44.764
<v Speaker 2>but regardless of old out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's still something fundamental at </v>

73
00:03:47.891 --> 00:03:50.500
<v Speaker 2>the bottom of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is addressed by that particular,</v>

74
00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:51.910
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rule,</v>

75
00:03:51.911 --> 00:03:54.760
<v Speaker 2>which is to be grateful in spite of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>suffering.</v>

76
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:55.593
<v Speaker 2>And the rule there is that the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people bump up against their own </v>

77
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:00.813
<v Speaker 2>limitations and their own </v>
<v Speaker 2>vulnerabilities means that life is </v>

78
00:04:03.101 --> 00:04:05.410
<v Speaker 2>characterized in an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a way that's,</v>

79
00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.150
<v Speaker 2>it's not fundamentally addressable or </v>
<v Speaker 2>removable by suffering.</v>

80
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.130
<v Speaker 2>And that's Buddhists dictate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

81
00:04:12.131 --> 00:04:14.440
<v Speaker 2>The Great Buddhist dictate is that life </v>
<v Speaker 2>is suffering.</v>

82
00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.053
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people think of that as a </v>

83
00:04:17.471 --> 00:04:20.830
<v Speaker 2>pessimistic claim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in one way it is.</v>

84
00:04:20.831 --> 00:04:22.360
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I should point out too,</v>

85
00:04:22.361 --> 00:04:26.440
<v Speaker 2>that that claim isn't limited among </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious thinkers to Buddhists.</v>

86
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

87
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.380
<v Speaker 2>the primary symbol of Christianity is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>crucified person.</v>

88
00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.240
<v Speaker 2>The relationship between that suffering </v>
<v Speaker 2>seems fairly self evident,</v>

89
00:04:37.241 --> 00:04:38.074
<v Speaker 2>especially when you also consider the </v>
<v Speaker 2>drama of the crucifixion was also </v>

90
00:04:41.591 --> 00:04:46.090
<v Speaker 2>accompanied by betrayal and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and torture before death.</v>

91
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.953
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's kind of like the ultimate in </v>

92
00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.810
<v Speaker 2>catastrophic stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course,</v>

93
00:04:49.811 --> 00:04:54.811
<v Speaker 2>Judaism concentrates to a large degree </v>
<v Speaker 2>on a history of suffering and the way,</v>

94
00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.340
<v Speaker 2>the manner in which that might be </v>
<v Speaker 2>addressed.</v>

95
00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.630
<v Speaker 2>So with regards to being grateful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

96
00:05:01.631 --> 00:05:02.291
<v Speaker 2>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

97
00:05:02.291 --> 00:05:03.124
<v Speaker 2>how can you be grateful as if your life </v>
<v Speaker 2>is characterized by the necessity of </v>

98
00:05:06.221 --> 00:05:07.870
<v Speaker 2>suffering?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

99
00:05:07.871 --> 00:05:10.260
<v Speaker 2>that needs to be stepped through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very thoughtful.</v>

100
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.980
<v Speaker 2>So the first thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are you doomed to suffer?</v>

101
00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.113
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is life set up so that people are </v>

102
00:05:17.381 --> 00:05:18.214
<v Speaker 2>due to suffer?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a constant existential complaint </v>

103
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.330
<v Speaker 2>that sort of echoes through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>centuries.</v>

104
00:05:25.331 --> 00:05:26.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hear it in different ways.</v>

105
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.960
<v Speaker 2>Why do good things happen to bad people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose is the most cliched way of,</v>

106
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.113
<v Speaker 2>of formulating the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's some deep answers to this </v>

107
00:05:36.521 --> 00:05:37.354
<v Speaker 2>question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like really deep answers and they're </v>

108
00:05:38.651 --> 00:05:41.020
<v Speaker 2>really helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so one of them is,</v>

109
00:05:41.021 --> 00:05:45.400
<v Speaker 2>and I learned this partly from reading </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jewish thought on the matter.</v>

110
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.540
<v Speaker 2>And at the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't tell you what the sources were,</v>

111
00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.433
<v Speaker 2>but I read two things that were really </v>
<v Speaker 2>helpful to me when I was trying to sort </v>

112
00:05:54.101 --> 00:05:54.460
<v Speaker 2>this out.</v>

113
00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.370
<v Speaker 2>And one was a common buyer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

114
00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:57.523
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jewish commentator I think from the </v>

115
00:05:58.371 --> 00:06:01.550
<v Speaker 2>Talmud who said that it was pc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He made a,</v>

116
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.700
<v Speaker 2>he presented a riddle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of like a Zen Koan.</v>

117
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:05.563
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Zen Koan is like the sound of one hand </v>

118
00:06:07.911 --> 00:06:11.870
<v Speaker 2>clapping just that actually this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>

119
00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:13.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that mysterious,</v>

120
00:06:13.581 --> 00:06:18.020
<v Speaker 2>but the question was it was about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>nature of God.</v>

121
00:06:18.021 --> 00:06:21.500
<v Speaker 2>And so the question runs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if God is omniscient,</v>

122
00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:27.190
<v Speaker 2>omnipresent and omnipotent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is sort of like the,</v>

123
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:29.263
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way that totality is being broken </v>

124
00:06:30.621 --> 00:06:35.621
<v Speaker 2>down into its sub elements,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what could he possibly lock and answer?</v>

125
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:40.460
<v Speaker 2>That is limitation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then there's a,</v>

126
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:41.683
<v Speaker 2>there's a corollary to that to that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>also derived from Jewish thought that </v>

127
00:06:45.081 --> 00:06:47.930
<v Speaker 2>runs that man in God or in the sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>twins,</v>

128
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:52.190
<v Speaker 2>they're like poles on a continuum and </v>
<v Speaker 2>god is the infinite end of the continuum</v>

129
00:06:52.191 --> 00:06:53.024
<v Speaker 2>and man is the fine idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the problem with the problem with </v>

130
00:06:56.901 --> 00:06:59.330
<v Speaker 2>being without limitation is that there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

131
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:00.880
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

132
00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.670
<v Speaker 2>there's no journey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no transformation,</v>

133
00:07:03.671 --> 00:07:05.800
<v Speaker 2>there's no change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no progress,</v>

134
00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.290
<v Speaker 2>there's no plot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing interesting.</v>

135
00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:09.693
<v Speaker 2>There's no differentiation between </v>
<v Speaker 2>things because everything can be </v>

136
00:07:11.771 --> 00:07:12.604
<v Speaker 2>anything at any moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the point of this Jewish line of </v>

137
00:07:16.241 --> 00:07:17.074
<v Speaker 2>thinking is that limitation is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>blessing because it allows for being </v>

138
00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.140
<v Speaker 2>without limitation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no being.</v>

139
00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:27.250
<v Speaker 2>So that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a hell of an observation.</v>

140
00:07:27.251 --> 00:07:29.020
<v Speaker 2>Without limitation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no big.</v>

141
00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:31.930
<v Speaker 2>So then the next question might be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

142
00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:34.330
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

143
00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:40.170
<v Speaker 2>if being necessitates limitation and </v>
<v Speaker 2>limitation generates suffering,</v>

144
00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:47.080
<v Speaker 2>then maybe being is not something to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>respected,</v>

145
00:07:47.081 --> 00:07:47.914
<v Speaker 2>are devoutly hoped for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's been examined very carefully </v>

146
00:07:50.621 --> 00:07:51.730
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so for example,</v>

147
00:07:51.731 --> 00:07:55.810
<v Speaker 2>Mephistopheles the character girth </v>
<v Speaker 2>girth,</v>

148
00:07:55.811 --> 00:07:59.200
<v Speaker 2>this character in false Mephistopheles </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's obviously the devil,</v>

149
00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:03.910
<v Speaker 2>his basic credo is that because limited </v>
<v Speaker 2>being produced as suffering,</v>

150
00:08:03.911 --> 00:08:08.020
<v Speaker 2>it should be eradicated because it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the same argument is sort of made by</v>

151
00:08:08.021 --> 00:08:10.510
<v Speaker 2>Ivan in the brothers Karamazov he </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically says,</v>

152
00:08:10.511 --> 00:08:11.344
<v Speaker 2>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world's a corrupt place because </v>

153
00:08:12.791 --> 00:08:15.820
<v Speaker 2>there's all these limited beings running</v>
<v Speaker 2>around in their suffering like mad.</v>

154
00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:18.340
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it'd be better if the whole thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>was just done away with.</v>

155
00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:23.710
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you think that's a good idea.</v>

156
00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:26.800
<v Speaker 2>And apparently there have been people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who have,</v>

157
00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.820
<v Speaker 2>it seems to be a really bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then you might ask,</v>

158
00:08:30.821 --> 00:08:31.840
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the alternative?</v>

159
00:08:31.841 --> 00:08:32.674
<v Speaker 2>And the alternative hypothetically is to</v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out a way of life that's </v>

160
00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:38.800
<v Speaker 2>intrinsically meaningful enough so that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the suffering is justified,</v>

161
00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:42.580
<v Speaker 2>not so that it can go away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that the core,</v>

162
00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:46.080
<v Speaker 2>the purpose of religious thinking and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

163
00:08:46.081 --> 00:08:46.914
<v Speaker 2>and the goal towards which it's directed</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to outline a motive being that </v>

164
00:08:50.921 --> 00:08:55.000
<v Speaker 2>justifies the suffering that life </v>
<v Speaker 2>entails.</v>

165
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:58.650
<v Speaker 2>And so if you live properly from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious perspective,</v>

166
00:08:58.651 --> 00:09:03.651
<v Speaker 2>then the suffering is not so burdensome </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it warps and,</v>

167
00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:10.840
<v Speaker 2>and corrupts you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And part of that is to be grateful.</v>

168
00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:13.750
<v Speaker 1>Could have been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I say,</v>

169
00:09:13.751 --> 00:09:18.751
<v Speaker 1>that the purpose of religious thought as</v>
<v Speaker 1>to reconcile us to the fact of that.</v>

170
00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:21.753
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

171
00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:22.803
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>religious thought is often criticized </v>

172
00:09:25.621 --> 00:09:27.690
<v Speaker 2>thoughtlessly for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

173
00:09:27.691 --> 00:09:28.524
<v Speaker 2>this kind of started most mostly with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Marxist send the Floridians back at </v>

174
00:09:31.201 --> 00:09:33.960
<v Speaker 2>the end of the 19th century.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

175
00:09:33.961 --> 00:09:34.794
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Freud believed that religion was a </v>

176
00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.630
<v Speaker 2>defense against death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>death,</v>

177
00:09:39.631 --> 00:09:40.464
<v Speaker 2>anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He thought about it as an infant title </v>

178
00:09:41.671 --> 00:09:42.504
<v Speaker 2>defense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know that people were afraid of </v>

179
00:09:43.501 --> 00:09:48.150
<v Speaker 2>death and because of that they stayed </v>
<v Speaker 2>infantiles and regarded,</v>

180
00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:49.253
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>generated a delusional hypothesis about </v>

181
00:09:51.961 --> 00:09:52.794
<v Speaker 2>the world being analogous to something </v>
<v Speaker 2>being taken care of by an all knowing </v>

182
00:09:56.641 --> 00:09:57.474
<v Speaker 2>and all loving father who was going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>pay us back for all the terrible </v>

183
00:10:00.751 --> 00:10:01.584
<v Speaker 2>limitations of suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Being Freud thought about that is very </v>

184
00:10:04.411 --> 00:10:06.900
<v Speaker 2>instant title.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then at the same time,</v>

185
00:10:06.901 --> 00:10:07.734
<v Speaker 2>Marx thought of religion from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>defensive perspective as the opiate of </v>

186
00:10:13.081 --> 00:10:13.950
<v Speaker 2>the masses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

187
00:10:13.951 --> 00:10:14.784
<v Speaker 2>Is that religion was something that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>powers that be promoted because it in </v>

188
00:10:18.991 --> 00:10:19.824
<v Speaker 2>Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people to the suffering that was a </v>

189
00:10:20.611 --> 00:10:21.444
<v Speaker 2>necessary consequence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well for marks at least of capitalist </v>

190
00:10:23.671 --> 00:10:25.020
<v Speaker 2>development.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

191
00:10:25.021 --> 00:10:28.830
<v Speaker 2>those critiques were extremely powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They dominated 20th century thought,</v>

192
00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:31.170
<v Speaker 2>but they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're fairly shallow.</v>

193
00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:32.413
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they are by their reasons why they </v>

194
00:10:33.371 --> 00:10:34.450
<v Speaker 1>were accepted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

195
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:38.680
<v Speaker 1>it's hard because they're half true.</v>

196
00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:40.160
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no by,</v>

197
00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.010
<v Speaker 1>but I would say it's more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

198
00:10:42.011 --> 00:10:43.630
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that they,</v>

199
00:10:43.631 --> 00:10:44.464
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

200
00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:45.990
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

201
00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:50.290
<v Speaker 1>meant to offer people a sense of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

202
00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:51.643
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

203
00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:52.873
<v Speaker 1>of their own life somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea of individualism and then </v>

204
00:10:57.431 --> 00:11:00.940
<v Speaker 1>social mastery of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of human affairs,</v>

205
00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:05.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was to when there has independent of the</v>

206
00:11:05.381 --> 00:11:06.800
<v Speaker 1>shackles of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of uh,</v>

207
00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:07.930
<v Speaker 1>religious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

208
00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:09.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dependents.</v>

209
00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:11.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That worked really well.</v>

210
00:11:11.181 --> 00:11:14.650
<v Speaker 1>We ran from the shackles dependence into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shackles of video,</v>

211
00:11:14.651 --> 00:11:16.070
<v Speaker 1>logical dependents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

212
00:11:16.071 --> 00:11:16.671
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

213
00:11:16.671 --> 00:11:19.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm with you on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But still,</v>

214
00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:24.170
<v Speaker 1>when ideas take as widely and as deeply </v>
<v Speaker 1>as atheism has,</v>

215
00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:28.670
<v Speaker 1>it means since pills at role,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a false idea.</v>

216
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:29.863
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like this was a trivial </v>

217
00:11:32.121 --> 00:11:35.240
<v Speaker 2>conflict and I'm not trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>trivialize either fried your marks.</v>

218
00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:37.280
<v Speaker 2>Like I think Marx was fundamentally </v>
<v Speaker 2>corrupt,</v>

219
00:11:37.281 --> 00:11:38.114
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think that if Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the Freudian criticism is an </v>

220
00:11:41.161 --> 00:11:43.080
<v Speaker 2>extremely deep one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

221
00:11:43.081 --> 00:11:46.610
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is basically half true.</v>

222
00:11:46.611 --> 00:11:47.444
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that Charles Taylor </v>

223
00:11:48.321 --> 00:11:49.520
<v Speaker 2>pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Taylor zone,</v>

224
00:11:49.521 --> 00:11:51.440
<v Speaker 2>philosopher Miguel and he wrote a book </v>
<v Speaker 2>called,</v>

225
00:11:51.441 --> 00:11:53.210
<v Speaker 2>I think it was called the sources of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>self.</v>

226
00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.410
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

227
00:11:56.411 --> 00:11:58.660
<v Speaker 2>he took Freud's argument depart and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

228
00:11:58.661 --> 00:12:00.160
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all well and good.</v>

229
00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:01.180
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

230
00:12:01.181 --> 00:12:04.150
<v Speaker 2>you can think of religious belief as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>naive,</v>

231
00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:06.850
<v Speaker 2>optimistic defense against death </v>
<v Speaker 2>anxiety,</v>

232
00:12:06.851 --> 00:12:07.684
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>except that the facts don't bear that </v>

233
00:12:09.581 --> 00:12:11.440
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because in Christianity,</v>

234
00:12:11.441 --> 00:12:12.430
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the middle,</v>

235
00:12:12.431 --> 00:12:13.264
<v Speaker 2>the Middle Ages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and later there are people who are </v>

236
00:12:15.641 --> 00:12:18.790
<v Speaker 2>powerfully terrified of hell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>

237
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:21.700
<v Speaker 2>it's one thing to be afraid of death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you believe in hell,</v>

238
00:12:21.701 --> 00:12:23.440
<v Speaker 2>hell is a lot worse than death.</v>

239
00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:25.240
<v Speaker 2>And so you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

240
00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:26.403
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to conjure up a whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion just to make you feel good </v>

241
00:12:28.271 --> 00:12:29.104
<v Speaker 2>about the fact that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to help you deal with the fact that </v>

242
00:12:31.931 --> 00:12:32.764
<v Speaker 2>you're going to die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why bother conjuring up a hell that you </v>

243
00:12:35.861 --> 00:12:39.580
<v Speaker 2>can suffer in forever if you make even </v>
<v Speaker 2>the slightest moral error.</v>

244
00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:40.571
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

245
00:12:40.571 --> 00:12:44.290
<v Speaker 2>that waits for you in infinitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

246
00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:46.300
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to be really cynical to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

247
00:12:46.301 --> 00:12:50.740
<v Speaker 2>you have to put something sour in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>medicine to make it believable.</v>

248
00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:52.450
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like that at all.</v>

249
00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:57.340
<v Speaker 2>But the develop medieval Christians were</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrified of hell.</v>

250
00:12:57.341 --> 00:12:59.590
<v Speaker 2>Like modern people are terrified of </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaninglessness.</v>

251
00:12:59.591 --> 00:13:00.424
<v Speaker 2>So you can't put at religions feet the </v>
<v Speaker 2>proposition of some simplistic antidote </v>

252
00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:07.463
<v Speaker 2>to the fear of death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's I know what Freud why for I did </v>

253
00:13:10.481 --> 00:13:11.314
<v Speaker 2>that and I think that religious belief </v>
<v Speaker 2>like any beliefs can be used in an </v>

254
00:13:14.831 --> 00:13:18.160
<v Speaker 2>infant title manner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as a deep criticism of religion,</v>

255
00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:22.150
<v Speaker 2>it's lacking and that's partly why you </v>
<v Speaker 2>own in Freud eventually parted ways,</v>

256
00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:23.493
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you'll notice that there was </v>

257
00:13:24.311 --> 00:13:28.600
<v Speaker 2>more to religion than defense and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that has to do with this suffering issue</v>

258
00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:29.493
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the antidote to suffering has </v>

259
00:13:33.431 --> 00:13:34.264
<v Speaker 2>meaning.</v>

260
00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.313
<v Speaker 2>Now some of that meaning can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>encapsulated in religious belief and </v>

261
00:13:37.811 --> 00:13:40.120
<v Speaker 2>that's sort of like the traditional </v>
<v Speaker 2>guide to meaning,</v>

262
00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:46.110
<v Speaker 2>but if meaning is pursued properly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then people don't get corrupted by their</v>

263
00:13:46.241 --> 00:13:49.900
<v Speaker 2>suffering and that actually diminishes </v>
<v Speaker 2>the net total of suffering,</v>

264
00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:52.450
<v Speaker 2>which is a really big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a really big gain.</v>

265
00:13:52.451 --> 00:13:54.610
<v Speaker 2>If you think suffering is the basic </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem,</v>

266
00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:59.500
<v Speaker 2>you certainly don't want to approach it </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a way that makes it worse.</v>

267
00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:00.540
<v Speaker 2>Like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

268
00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:01.120
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

269
00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:04.030
<v Speaker 2>that's not an acceptable philosophical </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument.</v>

270
00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:07.090
<v Speaker 2>If something's bad and you and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe it's bad,</v>

271
00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:11.830
<v Speaker 2>you are not allowed to use an antidote </v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes that thing works.</v>

272
00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:13.510
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to play that game,</v>

273
00:14:13.511 --> 00:14:14.344
<v Speaker 2>then people have to stop talking to you </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're violating the principle </v>

274
00:14:16.721 --> 00:14:21.070
<v Speaker 2>of noncontradiction and that's the basic</v>
<v Speaker 2>principle for community.</v>

275
00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:24.760
<v Speaker 2>Without that principle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>communication cannot take place.</v>

276
00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:26.380
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you play that game,</v>

277
00:14:26.381 --> 00:14:28.120
<v Speaker 2>you have to complete that by yourself in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a corner.</v>

278
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:30.790
<v Speaker 2>You can't actually have a discussion </v>
<v Speaker 2>with anybody if you've been to play that</v>

279
00:14:30.791 --> 00:14:31.624
<v Speaker 2>game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the gratitude issue is deeper too </v>

280
00:14:33.641 --> 00:14:35.980
<v Speaker 2>because one of the things that's pointed</v>
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>

281
00:14:35.981 --> 00:14:36.814
<v Speaker 2>for example in genesis in the second </v>
<v Speaker 2>chapter of Genesis or the second story </v>

282
00:14:42.251 --> 00:14:43.084
<v Speaker 2>of Genesis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the story of Cain and Abel </v>

283
00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:46.840
<v Speaker 2>Caine's big problem is that he's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>grateful.</v>

284
00:14:46.841 --> 00:14:50.080
<v Speaker 2>He's really resentful and Cain enabler </v>
<v Speaker 2>in some ways.</v>

285
00:14:50.081 --> 00:14:50.914
<v Speaker 2>The first two people and Keynes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a good guy and sort of like the model </v>

286
00:14:54.021 --> 00:14:57.500
<v Speaker 2>for good guys and Cain is a bad guy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the model for bad guys.</v>

287
00:14:57.501 --> 00:15:01.700
<v Speaker 2>They're sort of like Christ and Satan in</v>
<v Speaker 2>their nascent forms and keynes.</v>

288
00:15:01.701 --> 00:15:05.360
<v Speaker 2>Big problem is that he's resentful and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it really doesn't work out well.</v>

289
00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:06.253
<v Speaker 2>That makes him the first murderer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It also makes him the ancestor of the </v>

290
00:15:09.961 --> 00:15:14.780
<v Speaker 2>first person who makes tools of war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the in gratitude be characterized</v>

291
00:15:14.781 --> 00:15:17.040
<v Speaker 2>as Kane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean cane basically shakes his fist at</v>

292
00:15:17.041 --> 00:15:17.890
<v Speaker 2>God and says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

293
00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:18.983
<v Speaker 2>what sort of</v>

294
00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:24.380
<v Speaker 1>is there for a reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not meaning an accidental,</v>

295
00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:25.260
<v Speaker 1>that appearance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

296
00:15:25.261 --> 00:15:26.094
<v Speaker 1>Cain and Abel are what they are because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they intended to provide us with </v>

297
00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:33.480
<v Speaker 1>bookends of human possibilities.</v>

298
00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:34.933
<v Speaker 2>Like cain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cain makes the strongest possible </v>

299
00:15:37.001 --> 00:15:39.280
<v Speaker 2>rational argument for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaninglessness of life.</v>

300
00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:43.270
<v Speaker 2>He's just like Ivan in the brothers </v>
<v Speaker 2>Karamazov like,</v>

301
00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:44.133
<v Speaker 2>and one of the really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that's really </v>

302
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:47.503
<v Speaker 2>deceitful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deceitful about rationality is that </v>

303
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.840
<v Speaker 2>rationality also claims that it can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>used to justify lights and it can't,</v>

304
00:15:55.870 --> 00:16:00.780
<v Speaker 2>rationality can be used to take life </v>
<v Speaker 2>apart and to demolish its meaning,</v>

305
00:16:00.781 --> 00:16:01.614
<v Speaker 2>but it can't be used to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can't be used as an antidote against </v>

306
00:16:03.931 --> 00:16:04.764
<v Speaker 2>meaninglessness.</v>

307
00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:07.560
<v Speaker 1>It's too narrow a conduit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Jordan,</v>

308
00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:13.500
<v Speaker 1>what's your thinking on the queer by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the question of whether on uh,</v>

309
00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:18.720
<v Speaker 1>we are today more or less afraid of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>than we used to have been,</v>

310
00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:22.440
<v Speaker 1>let's say 20 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any thoughts on this?</v>

311
00:16:22.441 --> 00:16:23.274
<v Speaker 1>Objects?</v>

312
00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:27.840
<v Speaker 2>I think that we are in some ways and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not in some ways,</v>

313
00:16:27.841 --> 00:16:28.674
<v Speaker 2>so we are in some ways because we don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>really have to deal with it like people </v>

314
00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:36.133
<v Speaker 2>once did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that a good thing or bad </v>

315
00:16:39.061 --> 00:16:39.450
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

316
00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:40.283
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's a good thing at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it keeps us permanently </v>

317
00:16:41.911 --> 00:16:44.740
<v Speaker 2>immature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a bad thing.</v>

318
00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:45.783
<v Speaker 2>I mean all of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of the material that I've read that </v>

319
00:16:48.121 --> 00:16:48.954
<v Speaker 2>deals with such issues in a deep way </v>
<v Speaker 2>suggests that the way that you overcome </v>

320
00:16:52.481 --> 00:16:56.320
<v Speaker 2>your fear of something is by voluntarily</v>
<v Speaker 2>confronting it,</v>

321
00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:58.840
<v Speaker 2>not by running away from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I give you an example.</v>

322
00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:01.840
<v Speaker 2>I had a client once who was terrified of</v>
<v Speaker 2>death.</v>

323
00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:05.380
<v Speaker 2>And when I say terrifying to death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean terrified of death.</v>

324
00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:06.543
<v Speaker 2>This woman tried to force herself into </v>
<v Speaker 2>unconsciousness using various </v>

325
00:17:12.161 --> 00:17:17.161
<v Speaker 2>pharmacological means for like 20 hours </v>
<v Speaker 2>a day for 10 years because she,</v>

326
00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:21.350
<v Speaker 2>she thought life was so unbearable that </v>
<v Speaker 2>she didn't even want to be awake for it.</v>

327
00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:25.740
<v Speaker 2>And she was a vegetarian because partly </v>
<v Speaker 2>because she couldn't,</v>

328
00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:29.850
<v Speaker 2>she couldn't even tolerate walking into </v>
<v Speaker 2>a butcher store like,</v>

329
00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:31.050
<v Speaker 2>so she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was,</v>

330
00:17:31.051 --> 00:17:32.880
<v Speaker 2>she was too terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>

331
00:17:32.881 --> 00:17:35.400
<v Speaker 2>I took her to a bunch of store at one </v>
<v Speaker 2>point and watched her,</v>

332
00:17:35.401 --> 00:17:36.234
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a,</v>

333
00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:37.393
<v Speaker 2>it's a classic approach in psychotherapy</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have people come to confront the </v>

334
00:17:39.751 --> 00:17:40.584
<v Speaker 2>things they're afraid of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she was so terrified of death that </v>

335
00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:45.023
<v Speaker 2>it made it impossible for her to live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now what happened with her eventually </v>

336
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:52.770
<v Speaker 2>guided by her dreams because her dream </v>
<v Speaker 2>suggested what to do.</v>

337
00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:56.830
<v Speaker 2>I took her to a embalming human and </v>
<v Speaker 2>momming,</v>

338
00:17:56.850 --> 00:17:57.683
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

339
00:17:57.890 --> 00:18:02.610
<v Speaker 2>a great reburial preparation and well </v>
<v Speaker 2>the first thing that happened was,</v>

340
00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:05.790
<v Speaker 2>although she was absolutely terrified to</v>
<v Speaker 2>go there and didn't think that she would</v>

341
00:18:05.791 --> 00:18:06.624
<v Speaker 2>be able to angle it and like it's not a </v>
<v Speaker 2>trivial thing cause we were only about </v>

342
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:11.303
<v Speaker 2>eight feet away from the embalming and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just her and me and the person </v>

343
00:18:14.011 --> 00:18:15.930
<v Speaker 2>who was doing me and mommy and I mean </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a pretty,</v>

344
00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:18.840
<v Speaker 2>it's not one of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

345
00:18:18.841 --> 00:18:21.600
<v Speaker 2>it's a pretty visceral experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's put it that way.</v>

346
00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:22.883
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she looked away a lot during the </v>

347
00:18:25.561 --> 00:18:27.840
<v Speaker 2>procedure for the first 15 minutes or </v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

348
00:18:27.841 --> 00:18:29.280
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she didn't leave.</v>

349
00:18:29.281 --> 00:18:30.114
<v Speaker 2>Then after 15 minutes or so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was able to focus on the procedure </v>

350
00:18:33.091 --> 00:18:33.924
<v Speaker 2>pretty closely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And at one point she was even able to </v>

351
00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:39.360
<v Speaker 2>lay your hand on the body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean she had a glove on and it was all</v>

352
00:18:39.361 --> 00:18:40.194
<v Speaker 2>very carefully done and that was really </v>
<v Speaker 2>useful to her cause it kind of </v>

353
00:18:43.611 --> 00:18:44.444
<v Speaker 2>calibrated her in some way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It taught her the difference between </v>

354
00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:50.490
<v Speaker 2>what there is to be afraid of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's real.</v>

355
00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:51.563
<v Speaker 2>And all the shades and nightmares that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people encounter that are just in some </v>

356
00:18:55.531 --> 00:18:57.000
<v Speaker 2>ways there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

357
00:18:57.030 --> 00:18:59.910
<v Speaker 2>demonic or pathological figments of </v>
<v Speaker 2>their imagination.</v>

358
00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:01.023
<v Speaker 2>It was also very useful to me because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't done a lot of looking at a </v>

359
00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:06.810
<v Speaker 2>human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The caucus,</v>

360
00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:08.310
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very squeamish.</v>

361
00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:11.160
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say that I'm actually very </v>
<v Speaker 2>sensitive to discussed.</v>

362
00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:14.780
<v Speaker 2>It's a biological proclivity and so this</v>
<v Speaker 2>is part of me.</v>

363
00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:16.480
<v Speaker 2>I could have never been a surgeon than I</v>
<v Speaker 2>would.</v>

364
00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:18.720
<v Speaker 2>I would have a very difficult time </v>
<v Speaker 2>dealing with people,</v>

365
00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:22.200
<v Speaker 2>people's physiological trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

366
00:19:22.201 --> 00:19:26.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't have the stomach for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was really useful for me to go to</v>

367
00:19:26.521 --> 00:19:29.760
<v Speaker 2>the funeral home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not so much because I viewed the moment,</v>

368
00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:31.163
<v Speaker 2>but because it gave me a chance to talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>through the processes that are </v>

369
00:19:35.461 --> 00:19:36.294
<v Speaker 2>associated with depth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with someone who deals with it on a </v>

370
00:19:38.221 --> 00:19:39.210
<v Speaker 2>regular basis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

371
00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:41.340
<v Speaker 2>if human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>primary fear was death,</v>

372
00:19:41.341 --> 00:19:44.100
<v Speaker 2>there wouldn't be any funeral home </v>
<v Speaker 2>operators.</v>

373
00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:44.993
<v Speaker 2>How the hell could they manage it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well when I talked to the guys about </v>

374
00:19:47.701 --> 00:19:48.421
<v Speaker 2>that too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

375
00:19:48.421 --> 00:19:49.254
<v Speaker 2>and about how they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what sort of effect dealing with death </v>

376
00:19:51.331 --> 00:19:54.900
<v Speaker 2>on a nonstop basis had on their lives </v>
<v Speaker 2>and how they viewed the role.</v>

377
00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:55.733
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they view their role in some ways as </v>

378
00:19:57.541 --> 00:19:58.500
<v Speaker 2>shepherds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

379
00:19:58.501 --> 00:20:02.340
<v Speaker 2>They were shepherding people through the</v>
<v Speaker 2>process of death,</v>

380
00:20:02.341 --> 00:20:06.360
<v Speaker 2>which throws everything up in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were there to ritualize it in a</v>

381
00:20:06.361 --> 00:20:07.194
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they took that responsibility </v>

382
00:20:08.671 --> 00:20:09.504
<v Speaker 2>seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was also useful to me to figure </v>

383
00:20:11.491 --> 00:20:15.750
<v Speaker 2>out exactly what the practical steps </v>
<v Speaker 2>were involved in dealing with death.</v>

384
00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:20.310
<v Speaker 2>Because at some point you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have that responsibility.</v>

385
00:20:20.311 --> 00:20:23.850
<v Speaker 2>Someone close to you is going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And at that point you're either going to</v>

386
00:20:23.851 --> 00:20:25.470
<v Speaker 2>run around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

387
00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:28.830
<v Speaker 2>in a complete neurotic fit and be more </v>
<v Speaker 2>trouble than you're worth.</v>

388
00:20:28.831 --> 00:20:31.830
<v Speaker 2>Are you going to step up to the plate </v>
<v Speaker 2>and be helpful and um,</v>

389
00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:32.873
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and be strong and help the people who </v>

390
00:20:35.461 --> 00:20:39.420
<v Speaker 2>have to deal with that catastrophe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do it in a straightforward manner.</v>

391
00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:40.613
<v Speaker 2>And that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a responsibility that people </v>

392
00:20:42.151 --> 00:20:44.970
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to be a complete human being,</v>

393
00:20:44.971 --> 00:20:45.804
<v Speaker 2>you have to be strong enough to do that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're not going to be that way if </v>

394
00:20:48.071 --> 00:20:48.904
<v Speaker 2>you run away from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing about people is they're </v>

395
00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:54.610
<v Speaker 2>stronger than the fear of death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Death is terrible,</v>

396
00:20:54.611 --> 00:20:55.930
<v Speaker 2>but we're stronger than that.</v>

397
00:20:57.050 --> 00:21:00.100
<v Speaker 1>You had the reason to think about is </v>
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

398
00:21:00.101 --> 00:21:00.934
<v Speaker 1>some weeks or months ago we had a bit of</v>
<v Speaker 1>health problem and you didn't know what </v>

399
00:21:05.681 --> 00:21:08.770
<v Speaker 1>it was or you thought that was worse </v>
<v Speaker 1>than it actually was.</v>

400
00:21:08.771 --> 00:21:09.604
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you told me that you were thinking </v>

401
00:21:10.691 --> 00:21:12.040
<v Speaker 1>about possibility of dying.</v>

402
00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:13.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I hadn't,</v>

403
00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:18.510
<v Speaker 2>I had a lung shadow on a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on an x ray and which I thought was,</v>

404
00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:22.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>radiological error or something similar.</v>

405
00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:26.770
<v Speaker 2>But then for unrelated reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a month and a half or so later,</v>

406
00:21:26.771 --> 00:21:27.604
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started to get short of breath and </v>

407
00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:31.840
<v Speaker 2>then my energy level's declined </v>
<v Speaker 2>precipitously and I thought,</v>

408
00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:34.000
<v Speaker 2>Huh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not a great combination.</v>

409
00:21:34.001 --> 00:21:36.490
<v Speaker 2>Lung Shadow plus cancer symptoms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

410
00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:37.683
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

411
00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:44.230
<v Speaker 1>some days thinking about that by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility of,</v>

412
00:21:44.231 --> 00:21:46.520
<v Speaker 1>of much to premature demise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

413
00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:47.620
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would you think,</v>

414
00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:49.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what were your thoughts like?</v>

415
00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:50.933
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first thing I should say is that's </v>

416
00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:53.820
<v Speaker 2>not unfamiliar territory for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

417
00:21:53.821 --> 00:21:58.080
<v Speaker 2>I spent like really I spent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was writing my first book,</v>

418
00:21:58.081 --> 00:22:01.050
<v Speaker 2>I spent like a decade thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>death.</v>

419
00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:04.860
<v Speaker 2>And I mean it was really in some ways an</v>
<v Speaker 2>obsession.</v>

420
00:22:04.861 --> 00:22:07.260
<v Speaker 2>It was more the book's about me and not </v>
<v Speaker 2>about death.</v>

421
00:22:07.261 --> 00:22:08.094
<v Speaker 2>But as you already pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those two things are very tightly </v>

422
00:22:10.261 --> 00:22:11.190
<v Speaker 2>linked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

423
00:22:11.191 --> 00:22:12.480
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for months,</v>

424
00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:13.343
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even the first thought I had on waking </v>

425
00:22:16.051 --> 00:22:16.960
<v Speaker 2>up was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

426
00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:21.430
<v Speaker 2>life is short.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

427
00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:25.310
<v Speaker 2>I was very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very conscious of time passing by and,</v>

428
00:22:25.311 --> 00:22:29.120
<v Speaker 2>and potentially time passing by in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaningless and useless manner.</v>

429
00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:32.390
<v Speaker 2>Now why that was the case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God only knows,</v>

430
00:22:32.391 --> 00:22:33.224
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very difficult to understand what </v>

431
00:22:34.931 --> 00:22:38.380
<v Speaker 2>tribes are most spontaneous motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't have to go with the federal</v>

432
00:22:38.381 --> 00:22:39.740
<v Speaker 2>fee for that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

433
00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:40.421
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did,</v>

434
00:22:40.421 --> 00:22:41.171
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

435
00:22:41.171 --> 00:22:43.030
<v Speaker 2>I just happened to be conducting the </v>
<v Speaker 2>therapy.</v>

436
00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:46.840
<v Speaker 2>You can do a lot of therapy by reading </v>
<v Speaker 2>and by thinking and bike riding.</v>

437
00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.460
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a technical literature on that.</v>

438
00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:53.390
<v Speaker 2>Writing is unbelievably therapeutic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes you healthier</v>

439
00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:00.830
<v Speaker 1>the way you managed to think about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility of an early death.</v>

440
00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:04.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I mean what was,</v>

441
00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:09.920
<v Speaker 2>there was an element of black humor to </v>
<v Speaker 2>it I think,</v>

442
00:23:09.921 --> 00:23:10.754
<v Speaker 2>which is something that's often,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like the source of black humor </v>

443
00:23:13.041 --> 00:23:16.010
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause there's an absurdity about death,</v>

444
00:23:16.011 --> 00:23:16.844
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because within the sort of human domain </v>

445
00:23:19.851 --> 00:23:22.160
<v Speaker 2>of striving through our rules,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which has been,</v>

446
00:23:22.161 --> 00:23:24.050
<v Speaker 2>if you work hard and you do the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

447
00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:27.110
<v Speaker 2>then good things happen to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a game.</v>

448
00:23:27.111 --> 00:23:29.720
<v Speaker 2>You're playing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The game has these rules and if you play</v>

449
00:23:29.721 --> 00:23:30.554
<v Speaker 2>it properly then you get the benefits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But death is something that's sort of </v>

450
00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:33.733
<v Speaker 2>outside the rules of all games and </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether you've been playing the game </v>

451
00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:42.380
<v Speaker 2>properly or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't have that much effect on your</v>

452
00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:45.830
<v Speaker 2>ultimate vulnerability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's a,</v>

453
00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:47.870
<v Speaker 2>there's an absurdity about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

454
00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:51.620
<v Speaker 2>having come this far to be cut down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

455
00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:55.790
<v Speaker 2>at 50 cause I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm 50 seemed absurd.</v>

456
00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:56.923
<v Speaker 2>And so there was that element,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although I'm kind of used to absurdity </v>

457
00:23:58.941 --> 00:24:00.560
<v Speaker 2>in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that didn't bother me so much.</v>

458
00:24:00.561 --> 00:24:01.394
<v Speaker 2>But what really bothered me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it wasn't so much the </v>

459
00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:08.570
<v Speaker 2>contemplation of my own disappearance as</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I would miss,</v>

460
00:24:08.571 --> 00:24:09.031
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

461
00:24:09.031 --> 00:24:11.840
<v Speaker 2>and what the consequences of that would </v>
<v Speaker 2>also be for my family.</v>

462
00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:13.430
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because when you leave,</v>

463
00:24:13.431 --> 00:24:16.970
<v Speaker 2>you leave a hole and that's unpleasant </v>
<v Speaker 2>hope.</v>

464
00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:22.540
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully it's up and you miss things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a tragedy.</v>

465
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

466
00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:28.700
<v Speaker 2>so I had to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to sort through that.</v>

467
00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:30.920
<v Speaker 2>I guess it made it more personal.</v>

468
00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:36.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm curious about this concern for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wellbeing of uh,</v>

469
00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:37.713
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

470
00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:39.730
<v Speaker 1>Tammy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your wife and your children.</v>

471
00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:42.010
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

472
00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:44.440
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you feel that,</v>

473
00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:47.480
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were you afraid?</v>

474
00:24:47.481 --> 00:24:47.951
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

475
00:24:47.951 --> 00:24:50.000
<v Speaker 1>we're terrified of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

476
00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:51.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

477
00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:57.640
<v Speaker 1>of losing touch with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of the only true reality,</v>

478
00:24:58.191 --> 00:24:59.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

479
00:24:59.301 --> 00:25:03.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or did you do have an access to thoughts</v>

480
00:25:03.111 --> 00:25:05.390
<v Speaker 1>and feelings about the possibility of an</v>
<v Speaker 1>afterlife?</v>

481
00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:11.940
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

482
00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:14.730
<v Speaker 2>we mean the world is a very strange </v>
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

483
00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:16.840
<v Speaker 2>And for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ignorance,</v>

484
00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:22.230
<v Speaker 2>one of the things about humility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say something that's associated to</v>

485
00:25:23.141 --> 00:25:26.960
<v Speaker 2>some degree with gratitude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Humility is recognition of your,</v>

486
00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:27.843
<v Speaker 2>of your ignorance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And limits and people think that </v>

487
00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:34.950
<v Speaker 2>recognition of your ignorance and limits</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a frightening thing.</v>

488
00:25:34.951 --> 00:25:35.784
<v Speaker 2>So they often act in a narcissistic way </v>
<v Speaker 2>and lay claim to more knowledge than </v>

489
00:25:39.461 --> 00:25:40.294
<v Speaker 2>they have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there comes a point if you think </v>

490
00:25:42.521 --> 00:25:46.170
<v Speaker 2>things through that the fact that you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>ignorant is a great comfort.</v>

491
00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:47.850
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

492
00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:48.913
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean for me to be properly terrified </v>

493
00:25:50.361 --> 00:25:52.690
<v Speaker 2>and death in the sort of the classic </v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

494
00:25:52.691 --> 00:25:57.050
<v Speaker 2>I would have to assume that I knew what </v>
<v Speaker 2>life meant and how,</v>

495
00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:57.893
<v Speaker 2>why and how it is that we're here and </v>
<v Speaker 2>how our consciousness operates and what </v>

496
00:26:01.331 --> 00:26:02.164
<v Speaker 2>the relationship is between </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness and material reality and </v>

497
00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:06.303
<v Speaker 2>how time works and what's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship between the present and </v>

498
00:26:09.161 --> 00:26:12.850
<v Speaker 2>infinity and like not only do we not </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand those things,</v>

499
00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:15.400
<v Speaker 2>we don't understand them at all.</v>

500
00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:18.040
<v Speaker 2>We don't understand consciousness at </v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

501
00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:19.630
<v Speaker 2>We know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

502
00:26:19.631 --> 00:26:20.464
<v Speaker 2>the physicists have taught us that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an intake or relationship </v>

503
00:26:22.541 --> 00:26:23.374
<v Speaker 2>between consciousness and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>manifestation of the transformation of </v>

504
00:26:29.171 --> 00:26:30.004
<v Speaker 2>possibility into actuality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Consciousness transforms actuality into </v>

505
00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:35.493
<v Speaker 2>our potentiality to actuality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it does that literally in that </v>

506
00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:41.680
<v Speaker 2>before something is consciously </v>
<v Speaker 2>perceived.</v>

507
00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:45.060
<v Speaker 2>It exists as like a set of </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibilities,</v>

508
00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:48.480
<v Speaker 2>none of which are specified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it isn't till consciousness observes</v>

509
00:26:48.481 --> 00:26:51.330
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it snaps into actual being.</v>

510
00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:52.663
<v Speaker 2>This isn't metaphysics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is quantum physics and quantum </v>

511
00:26:55.261 --> 00:26:56.094
<v Speaker 2>physics is why we're talking to one </v>
<v Speaker 2>another and underlies all the </v>

512
00:26:58.441 --> 00:27:00.300
<v Speaker 2>electronics we use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It underlies everything.</v>

513
00:27:00.301 --> 00:27:04.020
<v Speaker 2>And it's the only scientific theory that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've ever produced but has never made a</v>

514
00:27:04.021 --> 00:27:04.854
<v Speaker 2>prediction error.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's as right as things get with </v>

515
00:27:08.281 --> 00:27:10.650
<v Speaker 2>regards to an afterlife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

516
00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:12.473
<v Speaker 2>I've had strange experiences that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>taught me things about the potential </v>

517
00:27:16.351 --> 00:27:17.184
<v Speaker 2>nature of consciousness and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so that makes me unwilling to make </v>

518
00:27:21.901 --> 00:27:22.734
<v Speaker 2>any final claims about what's immortal </v>
<v Speaker 2>and what's mortal and how those things </v>

519
00:27:27.931 --> 00:27:29.940
<v Speaker 2>are related and how I'm tangled up in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

520
00:27:29.941 --> 00:27:34.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm so ignorant about that,</v>

521
00:27:34.291 --> 00:27:36.120
<v Speaker 2>that I can't say it really terrifies me.</v>

522
00:27:38.410 --> 00:27:42.470
<v Speaker 1>There was the one thing is</v>

523
00:27:43.890 --> 00:27:44.340
<v Speaker 3>okay</v>

524
00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:48.410
<v Speaker 1>and obviously interesting about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about being modern living,</v>

525
00:27:48.411 --> 00:27:49.244
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

526
00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:51.680
<v Speaker 1>at the beginning of the 21st century is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

527
00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:52.573
<v Speaker 1>is that so many of us have grown up </v>
<v Speaker 1>without any reliance on the thought of </v>

528
00:27:57.861 --> 00:27:59.900
<v Speaker 1>the possibility of afterlife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

529
00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:01.113
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>though what's also interesting is that </v>

530
00:28:03.321 --> 00:28:06.080
<v Speaker 1>we also living in a time when there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

531
00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:06.933
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who increasingly imagine the </v>

532
00:28:09.861 --> 00:28:13.160
<v Speaker 1>possibility of extending the lifespan of</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness,</v>

533
00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:17.060
<v Speaker 1>if not of the physical bodies by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the process of,</v>

534
00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:17.490
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

535
00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:20.790
<v Speaker 1>by imagining that consciousness can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>digitized and,</v>

536
00:28:20.791 --> 00:28:21.510
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

537
00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:25.280
<v Speaker 1>and that can be then uploaded or </v>
<v Speaker 1>downloaded into,</v>

538
00:28:25.281 --> 00:28:26.810
<v Speaker 1>into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

539
00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:27.890
<v Speaker 1>into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

540
00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:30.880
<v Speaker 1>add the vehicles of life rather than the</v>

541
00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:32.873
<v Speaker 2>uploaded into our digital reality where </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's at least 26 digital virgins </v>

542
00:28:36.751 --> 00:28:38.870
<v Speaker 2>waiting for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the ultimate,</v>

543
00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:41.630
<v Speaker 1>the number is 76,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven.</v>

544
00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:42.553
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

545
00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:47.493
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have any response to that </v>

546
00:28:50.661 --> 00:28:55.661
<v Speaker 1>proposition that that is possible to </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine consciousness to be made,</v>

547
00:28:56.061 --> 00:28:56.930
<v Speaker 1>to be a tonal?</v>

548
00:28:58.660 --> 00:28:59.770
<v Speaker 2>I think it's silly,</v>

549
00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:05.273
<v Speaker 2>technically silly because there's just </v>
<v Speaker 2>so many things it doesn't take into </v>

550
00:29:10.141 --> 00:29:10.974
<v Speaker 2>account.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's based on a very peculiar </v>

551
00:29:12.781 --> 00:29:16.230
<v Speaker 2>apprehension of what constitutes </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness.</v>

552
00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:17.483
<v Speaker 2>Like it's a shallow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a shallow approach to a deep </v>

553
00:29:19.471 --> 00:29:21.540
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

554
00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:22.793
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems that consciousness requires </v>

555
00:29:24.481 --> 00:29:27.100
<v Speaker 2>embodiment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

556
00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:29.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>modern Kwanzaa,</v>

557
00:29:29.610 --> 00:29:30.443
<v Speaker 2>I atheists have the idea that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>alerts at the bottom of their thinking </v>

558
00:29:35.111 --> 00:29:39.340
<v Speaker 2>that the soul is sort of like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of like a disembodied ghost.</v>

559
00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:43.030
<v Speaker 2>It looks like a body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can see through it and have some</v>

560
00:29:43.031 --> 00:29:45.580
<v Speaker 2>of the attributes of a body because </v>
<v Speaker 2>otherwise it couldn't exist.</v>

561
00:29:45.581 --> 00:29:48.790
<v Speaker 2>But like it's very vague and ill </v>
<v Speaker 2>defined.</v>

562
00:29:48.791 --> 00:29:49.301
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

563
00:29:49.301 --> 00:29:50.950
<v Speaker 2>you're going to upload your </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness.</v>

564
00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:52.360
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>

565
00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:55.770
<v Speaker 2>So what exactly are you uploading?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not blowing,</v>

566
00:29:56.190 --> 00:29:59.070
<v Speaker 2>you're not blowing your anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can upload your pain,</v>

567
00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:00.390
<v Speaker 2>you cannot devote your hunger.</v>

568
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.760
<v Speaker 2>Are you going to upload your sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>desire or are going to be free of all of</v>

569
00:30:04.761 --> 00:30:06.240
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

570
00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:09.370
<v Speaker 2>well you want to be free of all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

571
00:30:09.371 --> 00:30:10.960
<v Speaker 2>what are you then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's left of you?</v>

572
00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:13.510
<v Speaker 2>If your limitations are all gone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's left of you?</v>

573
00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:16.030
<v Speaker 2>That's a weird thing because you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

574
00:30:16.210 --> 00:30:18.730
<v Speaker 2>if your limitations are all gone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're,</v>

575
00:30:20.410 --> 00:30:21.243
<v Speaker 2>you're without limitation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the genie has escaped from </v>

576
00:30:24.101 --> 00:30:25.510
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the little lamp.</v>

577
00:30:26.050 --> 00:30:27.850
<v Speaker 2>Well you need the lamp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

578
00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:29.140
<v Speaker 2>no lab,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no genie.</v>

579
00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:31.780
<v Speaker 2>So you're an upload your consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

580
00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:34.250
<v Speaker 2>And then what are you going to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

581
00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:35.133
<v Speaker 2>sit inside a computer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why you can have any motivation to do </v>

582
00:30:37.871 --> 00:30:40.060
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because like your motivation,</v>

583
00:30:40.061 --> 00:30:44.560
<v Speaker 2>we know your motivation is all tied </v>
<v Speaker 2>intrinsically to your physiology.</v>

584
00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:47.170
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>

585
00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:48.033
<v Speaker 2>it's like to me that the engineers who </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about it's Marvin minsky mostly </v>

586
00:30:52.151 --> 00:30:55.210
<v Speaker 2>he's talked about uploading and Curt </v>
<v Speaker 2>Swan.</v>

587
00:30:55.211 --> 00:30:56.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's from,</v>

588
00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:57.303
<v Speaker 2>it's from Mitski essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's lots of things that </v>

589
00:31:00.191 --> 00:31:01.024
<v Speaker 2>are smart about engineers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but metaphysical philosophy is not one </v>

590
00:31:04.151 --> 00:31:04.984
<v Speaker 2>of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I read that stuff and I think </v>

591
00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:08.463
<v Speaker 2>like</v>

592
00:31:09.810 --> 00:31:10.643
<v Speaker 2>you guys are as bad at talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>Meta physics as postmodernist humanists </v>

593
00:31:16.501 --> 00:31:17.334
<v Speaker 2>are talking about engineering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you should just stay out of it </v>

594
00:31:22.171 --> 00:31:24.190
<v Speaker 2>because it's your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

595
00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:25.303
<v Speaker 2>the approach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the approach is basically </v>

596
00:31:27.330 --> 00:31:28.163
<v Speaker 2>equivalent to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That characterizes a really curious and </v>

597
00:31:31.091 --> 00:31:36.091
<v Speaker 2>precocious 13 year old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no real thinking that goes along</v>

598
00:31:36.811 --> 00:31:37.644
<v Speaker 2>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a dream while we could upload </v>

599
00:31:39.211 --> 00:31:42.930
<v Speaker 2>our consciousness into a machine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's a dream.</v>

600
00:31:42.931 --> 00:31:43.764
<v Speaker 2>It's a myth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the myth of the Golem or the </v>

601
00:31:46.411 --> 00:31:48.150
<v Speaker 2>myth of Frankenstein.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously,</v>

602
00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:49.673
<v Speaker 2>if we can only transcend this body and </v>
<v Speaker 2>put ourselves into something else was </v>

603
00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:53.820
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry guys,</v>

604
00:31:53.821 --> 00:31:56.760
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna have to do a lot more </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about that issue before you can</v>

605
00:31:56.761 --> 00:31:58.380
<v Speaker 2>have an intelligent discussion about it.</v>

606
00:31:58.570 --> 00:31:59.430
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jordan,</v>

607
00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:04.230
<v Speaker 1>we will stop now because I think we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>talked long enough and the next time,</v>

608
00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:06.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that's going to be,</v>

609
00:32:06.541 --> 00:32:07.374
<v Speaker 1>we will then talk about next topic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we then managed to squeeze into </v>

610
00:32:10.771 --> 00:32:13.110
<v Speaker 1>this one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is we just have to think about the</v>

611
00:32:13.111 --> 00:32:15.480
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to say one more thing,</v>

612
00:32:15.481 --> 00:32:16.314
<v Speaker 1>just talk</v>

613
00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:20.353
<v Speaker 2>part of what I was this little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this 42 exercises is sort of an </v>

614
00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:25.970
<v Speaker 2>exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm hoping that will involve the mapping</v>

615
00:32:25.971 --> 00:32:26.804
<v Speaker 2>of very deep ideas onto sort of everyday</v>
<v Speaker 2>issues cause deep ideas should be </v>

616
00:32:32.301 --> 00:32:33.134
<v Speaker 2>related to everyday issues in a niche </v>
<v Speaker 2>like indirectly because everyday things </v>

617
00:32:37.101 --> 00:32:41.210
<v Speaker 2>are deep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the viewpoint,</v>

618
00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:42.153
<v Speaker 2>like</v>

619
00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:47.450
<v Speaker 2>we've talked about this before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and I privately but,</v>

620
00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:50.053
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's something that has to be stated in </v>

621
00:32:51.081 --> 00:32:53.300
<v Speaker 2>order to make this kind of conversation </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligible.</v>

622
00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:57.920
<v Speaker 2>I am not a materialist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like some people say that but they don't</v>

623
00:32:57.921 --> 00:32:59.990
<v Speaker 2>mean it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean it,</v>

624
00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:02.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't think the most real things of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world,</v>

625
00:33:02.301 --> 00:33:03.134
<v Speaker 2>our material,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think the fact that we think that </v>

626
00:33:05.481 --> 00:33:09.260
<v Speaker 2>they are makes us ill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's existential illness.</v>

627
00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:10.183
<v Speaker 2>It's actually an illness and the reason </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an illness is it speak it because </v>

628
00:33:13.491 --> 00:33:14.324
<v Speaker 2>it's predicated on a view of the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's solely incomplete that it can't </v>

629
00:33:17.031 --> 00:33:19.160
<v Speaker 2>function.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

630
00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:20.323
<v Speaker 2>one of the pieces of evidence that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't function is people's existential </v>

631
00:33:24.231 --> 00:33:27.800
<v Speaker 2>angst and the fact that they're driven </v>
<v Speaker 2>to find systems of meaning,</v>

632
00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:31.310
<v Speaker 2>especially in the 20th century that were</v>
<v Speaker 2>extremely pathological.</v>

633
00:33:31.311 --> 00:33:34.220
<v Speaker 2>They're driven into the arms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>pathological replacements.</v>

634
00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:38.060
<v Speaker 2>There's an alternative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you're not a materialist,</v>

635
00:33:38.061 --> 00:33:39.470
<v Speaker 2>you have to pause it.</v>

636
00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:40.303
<v Speaker 2>That something else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that the ground of being cause it's </v>

637
00:33:42.501 --> 00:33:43.334
<v Speaker 2>material for materialists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though if you look into material </v>

638
00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:48.290
<v Speaker 2>hard enough like the quantum physicists </v>
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>

639
00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:52.550
<v Speaker 2>it turns into something that's so unlike</v>
<v Speaker 2>material that you know you might as well</v>

640
00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:53.413
<v Speaker 2>not if you've been bothered with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole materialism to begin with because </v>

641
00:33:56.240 --> 00:34:00.770
<v Speaker 2>if you think religion is weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know you should read quantum physics</v>

642
00:34:00.771 --> 00:34:01.604
<v Speaker 2>for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that material is the most </v>

643
00:34:04.401 --> 00:34:06.920
<v Speaker 2>real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the most real thing is meaning.</v>

644
00:34:08.350 --> 00:34:10.430
<v Speaker 2>And I think that meaning is a real </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

645
00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:11.470
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's real,</v>

646
00:34:11.471 --> 00:34:12.304
<v Speaker 2>that it's the most real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I also think that you're set up </v>

647
00:34:14.811 --> 00:34:15.644
<v Speaker 2>physiologically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>materially if you want all the evidence </v>

648
00:34:19.821 --> 00:34:24.320
<v Speaker 2>is that your physiology responds to </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning and not to material reality.</v>

649
00:34:24.350 --> 00:34:26.420
<v Speaker 2>That's when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we talk about the future,</v>

650
00:34:26.421 --> 00:34:27.254
<v Speaker 2>we'll talk about that a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 2>because when you interact with the </v>

651
00:34:29.661 --> 00:34:30.494
<v Speaker 2>future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're interacting with is the </v>

652
00:34:32.181 --> 00:34:34.010
<v Speaker 2>meaning of possibilities.</v>

653
00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:38.060
<v Speaker 2>That is what the future is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the meaning of possibilities.</v>

654
00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:41.630
<v Speaker 2>And I don't mean that metaphorically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that literally,</v>

655
00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:42.973
<v Speaker 2>and not only do I mean that literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean biologically in that that's what </v>

656
00:34:47.091 --> 00:34:49.570
<v Speaker 2>your brain does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your brain apprehends the mirror,</v>

657
00:34:49.571 --> 00:34:50.404
<v Speaker 2>yet meaningful possibilities of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>multiple futures that could manifest </v>

658
00:34:55.641 --> 00:34:57.980
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what you interact with.</v>

659
00:34:58.370 --> 00:34:59.203
<v Speaker 2>And modern people are so dopey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think they interact with material </v>

660
00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:04.090
<v Speaker 2>and that makes them sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That idea because it's,</v>

661
00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:08.000
<v Speaker 2>it's not a sustaining idea and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't even act that way.</v>

662
00:35:08.001 --> 00:35:09.350
<v Speaker 2>They say things like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

663
00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:10.813
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to make the most of your </v>

664
00:35:11.781 --> 00:35:12.614
<v Speaker 2>potential.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they don't even notice that </v>

665
00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:15.763
<v Speaker 2>they're saying something that's entirely</v>
<v Speaker 2>nonsensical from a materialist </v>

666
00:35:18.051 --> 00:35:19.370
<v Speaker 2>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

667
00:35:19.371 --> 00:35:21.560
<v Speaker 2>what the hell is this potential that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about?</v>

668
00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:25.370
<v Speaker 2>You can't measure it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It only exists in possibility.</v>

669
00:35:25.730 --> 00:35:26.563
<v Speaker 2>It only exists as something you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>conceivably bring into being or </v>

670
00:35:30.651 --> 00:35:33.830
<v Speaker 2>interfere with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though everyone knows that,</v>

671
00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:36.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not living up to your po possibility and</v>

672
00:35:36.471 --> 00:35:40.470
<v Speaker 2>not fulfilling potential is a great sin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one notices that.</v>

673
00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:43.470
<v Speaker 2>You just can't say something like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and be a materialist.</v>

674
00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:46.573
<v Speaker 2>We will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we will continue this next time and we </v>

675
00:35:49.051 --> 00:35:51.520
<v Speaker 2>talk about the multiple futures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

676
00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:55.680
<v Speaker 2>but for the time being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thanks Jordan and see you again.</v>
