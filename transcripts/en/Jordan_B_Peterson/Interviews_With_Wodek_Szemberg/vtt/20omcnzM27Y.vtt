1
00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:05.460
<v Speaker 1>This is our first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2
00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:06.403
<v Speaker 1>a hangout google hangout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope the first of many you are Jordan </v>

3
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.413
<v Speaker 1>Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that professor of psychology at the </v>

4
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.650
<v Speaker 1>University of Toronto and I'm Wodek </v>
<v Speaker 1>Szemberg a producer within the agenda,</v>

5
00:00:19.651 --> 00:00:20.484
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at Tvo and today we are going to be </v>

6
00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:28.590
<v Speaker 1>speaking about a book that you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning to work on,</v>

7
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.110
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's your,</v>

8
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.710
<v Speaker 1>it's your second book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

9
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.440
<v Speaker 1>and tell us first a bit about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

10
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:36.623
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first book that you written and how </v>

11
00:00:39.201 --> 00:00:41.690
<v Speaker 1>long it took you to write that one.</v>

12
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:43.513
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wrote a book called maps of meaning </v>

13
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.730
<v Speaker 2>the architecture of beliefs back in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was published in 1999 and now it took</v>

14
00:00:49.731 --> 00:00:50.564
<v Speaker 2>me 15 years to write and I wrote three </v>
<v Speaker 2>hours a day basically for almost that </v>

15
00:00:57.921 --> 00:00:58.754
<v Speaker 2>whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it took a long time and it's </v>

16
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.260
<v Speaker 2>correspondingly difficult to read.</v>

17
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.050
<v Speaker 1>Obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously you are not trying to spend 15</v>

18
00:01:09.051 --> 00:01:11.780
<v Speaker 1>years writing a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next one,</v>

19
00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.650
<v Speaker 1>the title was the book's title is 42 </v>
<v Speaker 1>wide,</v>

20
00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:17.583
<v Speaker 1>42.</v>

21
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.670
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was partly,</v>

22
00:01:19.671 --> 00:01:20.810
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would,</v>

23
00:01:20.811 --> 00:01:22.830
<v Speaker 2>what do you call that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

24
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:24.463
<v Speaker 2>well fluke isn't exactly the right word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's the only one I can think up at </v>

25
00:01:27.621 --> 00:01:28.454
<v Speaker 2>the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started experimenting with a website </v>

26
00:01:30.951 --> 00:01:31.784
<v Speaker 2>called Quora.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Quora is a relatively new site where </v>

27
00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.800
<v Speaker 2>anyone can post any question and anyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>can post any answer.</v>

28
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.390
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the answers are voted on by the</v>

29
00:01:44.391 --> 00:01:46.910
<v Speaker 2>target population who's interested in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the question.</v>

30
00:01:46.911 --> 00:01:47.744
<v Speaker 2>And so I wrote 45 or 50 answers to </v>
<v Speaker 2>different questions and one of them was </v>

31
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.450
<v Speaker 2>a list of rules for living.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question was,</v>

32
00:01:56.451 --> 00:01:58.600
<v Speaker 2>does anyone have a good list of rules </v>
<v Speaker 2>for living?</v>

33
00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.070
<v Speaker 2>And so I thought I'd take a crack at </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and I wrote 40,</v>

34
00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.963
<v Speaker 2>turned out that I wrote 41 rules for </v>
<v Speaker 2>living and it became quite popular on </v>

35
00:02:08.051 --> 00:02:08.884
<v Speaker 2>Quora.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It got something in the neighborhood or </v>

36
00:02:10.751 --> 00:02:13.480
<v Speaker 2>has accrued something in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood of 500 up folds,</v>

37
00:02:13.481 --> 00:02:15.040
<v Speaker 2>which puts it in the top.</v>

38
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.873
<v Speaker 2>One or two percent of all the thousands </v>
<v Speaker 2>of answers that have been posted on </v>

39
00:02:20.171 --> 00:02:21.004
<v Speaker 2>quora.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And lots of my other answers have </v>

40
00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.520
<v Speaker 2>nowhere near that kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

41
00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:25.713
<v Speaker 2>popular success.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I was thinking about the list </v>

42
00:02:28.541 --> 00:02:29.374
<v Speaker 2>and I remembered that there was a book </v>
<v Speaker 2>written by Adam so long while back </v>

43
00:02:35.231 --> 00:02:38.530
<v Speaker 2>called hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Douglas Adams,</v>

44
00:02:38.531 --> 00:02:39.364
<v Speaker 2>and in that book a computer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a super computer in the future is asked </v>

45
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.900
<v Speaker 2>the question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the answer to life,</v>

46
00:02:46.901 --> 00:02:47.734
<v Speaker 2>the universe and everything and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>answer that the computer spits out </v>

47
00:02:50.621 --> 00:02:52.150
<v Speaker 2>after,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I remember correctly,</v>

48
00:02:52.151 --> 00:02:56.020
<v Speaker 2>several thousand years of computation </v>
<v Speaker 2>was 42.</v>

49
00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.370
<v Speaker 2>And I believe the computer also comments</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that is the correct answer,</v>

50
00:03:00.371 --> 00:03:01.204
<v Speaker 2>but that the people who are going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>receive at aren't smart enough to </v>

51
00:03:03.431 --> 00:03:06.730
<v Speaker 2>understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I thought,</v>

52
00:03:06.731 --> 00:03:07.564
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one more answer that gives me 42 and </v>

53
00:03:10.571 --> 00:03:14.380
<v Speaker 2>then that would be a funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bit of serendipity.</v>

54
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.950
<v Speaker 2>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the word I was looking for.</v>

55
00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.190
<v Speaker 1>You remember which one was the second to</v>
<v Speaker 1>rule that you came up with?</v>

56
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.340
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember clones?</v>

57
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.100
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could find out but I don't remember.</v>

58
00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.140
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

59
00:03:35.141 --> 00:03:37.030
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let me ask you this question.</v>

60
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.210
<v Speaker 1>Why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is it that a 10th amendments and not</v>

61
00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.840
<v Speaker 1>sufficient for us to live by and why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do we need a,</v>

62
00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.550
<v Speaker 1>a fresh list of rules that will guide </v>
<v Speaker 1>our life's choices?</v>

63
00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:53.160
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first thing is,</v>

64
00:03:53.161 --> 00:03:53.994
<v Speaker 2>is that if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you actually look in the Old </v>

65
00:03:55.471 --> 00:03:57.570
<v Speaker 2>Testament where the 10 commandments are </v>
<v Speaker 2>listed,</v>

66
00:03:57.571 --> 00:04:00.100
<v Speaker 2>you'll find that there are far more than</v>
<v Speaker 2>talent.</v>

67
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.460
<v Speaker 2>The tanner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose,</v>

68
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.790
<v Speaker 2>what might be regarded as the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>crucial rule.</v>

69
00:04:04.791 --> 00:04:07.560
<v Speaker 2>So even back when the 10 commandments </v>
<v Speaker 2>were formulated,</v>

70
00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.710
<v Speaker 2>10 rules wasn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's also something about the way</v>

71
00:04:12.711 --> 00:04:16.640
<v Speaker 2>people think that makes them quite happy</v>
<v Speaker 2>about lists,</v>

72
00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:17.840
<v Speaker 2>numbered lists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

73
00:04:17.841 --> 00:04:18.674
<v Speaker 2>when you see this very frequently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the seven habits of successful people </v>

74
00:04:21.981 --> 00:04:23.290
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so forth.</v>

75
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.593
<v Speaker 2>Then once the list is numbered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it sort of tiny and it seems well </v>

76
00:04:29.181 --> 00:04:32.680
<v Speaker 2>organized and it's sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>

77
00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.500
<v Speaker 2>It implies that it's comprehensible and </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhat comprehensive.</v>

78
00:04:36.501 --> 00:04:37.334
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that was part of the </v>

79
00:04:38.451 --> 00:04:40.460
<v Speaker 2>attractiveness of this particular </v>
<v Speaker 2>answer.</v>

80
00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.190
<v Speaker 2>So other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't really say,</v>

81
00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.230
<v Speaker 2>and I guess people are looking for </v>
<v Speaker 2>simplicity,</v>

82
00:04:45.231 --> 00:04:46.870
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And 43 is quite a few,</v>

83
00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:47.713
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

84
00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:50.753
<v Speaker 1>I must say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I must say that I was a bit taken aback </v>

85
00:04:52.741 --> 00:04:54.160
<v Speaker 1>by some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

86
00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.800
<v Speaker 1>by virtue of the fact that they seem to </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather a lacking in,</v>

87
00:05:01.501 --> 00:05:02.201
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

88
00:05:02.201 --> 00:05:04.880
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in importance,</v>

89
00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:10.350
<v Speaker 1>others say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seem to naturally possess a,</v>

90
00:05:10.351 --> 00:05:12.960
<v Speaker 1>as in be truthful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

91
00:05:12.961 --> 00:05:17.961
<v Speaker 1>that's a great role that seems to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seems to have all the bells and whistles</v>

92
00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:19.150
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

93
00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.983
<v Speaker 1>of truth to live by that here are some </v>
<v Speaker 1>others which seem to not to be at the </v>

94
00:05:25.131 --> 00:05:26.370
<v Speaker 1>same caliber.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is,</v>

95
00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.850
<v Speaker 1>these are the ones I want to talk to you</v>
<v Speaker 1>about today.</v>

96
00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:29.973
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully we'll get another chance to </v>

97
00:05:30.981 --> 00:05:33.170
<v Speaker 1>talk about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll say they're on.</v>

98
00:05:33.171 --> 00:05:36.970
<v Speaker 1>So we will talk about the important of </v>
<v Speaker 1>as quote unquote a.</v>

99
00:05:36.971 --> 00:05:40.090
<v Speaker 1>So here's one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

100
00:05:40.091 --> 00:05:41.710
<v Speaker 1>number 14,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

101
00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.460
<v Speaker 1>try to make one room in your house as </v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful as possible.</v>

102
00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.850
<v Speaker 2>Why is that important?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

103
00:05:48.851 --> 00:05:53.470
<v Speaker 2>because if you want to improve things on</v>
<v Speaker 2>a medium to large scale,</v>

104
00:05:53.471 --> 00:05:55.300
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that would be important.</v>

105
00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.940
<v Speaker 2>It's really useful to doing so on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>small scale.</v>

106
00:05:58.941 --> 00:06:03.020
<v Speaker 2>So you actually learn how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And No,</v>

107
00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.540
<v Speaker 2>it isn't that easy to make a single room</v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful.</v>

108
00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:08.870
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard and it's hard.</v>

109
00:06:08.871 --> 00:06:13.871
<v Speaker 2>Plus it's the knowledge you generate </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing that is also generalizable because</v>

110
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.900
<v Speaker 2>fixing up one thing is a lot like fixing</v>
<v Speaker 2>up another thing.</v>

111
00:06:17.901 --> 00:06:18.734
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of commonality between the</v>
<v Speaker 2>attempts to improve one thing and </v>

112
00:06:23.221 --> 00:06:24.054
<v Speaker 2>another thing and you can start locally </v>
<v Speaker 2>like with the room and the first thing </v>

113
00:06:27.931 --> 00:06:28.764
<v Speaker 2>you find out is that it's not trivial to</v>
<v Speaker 2>try to make a single room beautiful and </v>

114
00:06:32.281 --> 00:06:33.114
<v Speaker 2>that you learn an awful lot about beauty</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you learn an awful lot about paying </v>

115
00:06:36.241 --> 00:06:37.074
<v Speaker 2>attention and you learn an awful lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>about how you could make what you </v>

116
00:06:40.381 --> 00:06:45.150
<v Speaker 2>already have much better than it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>merely by paying attention to it.</v>

117
00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:46.013
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't really say merely because </v>

118
00:06:47.731 --> 00:06:49.830
<v Speaker 2>paying attention to things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's almost everything.</v>

119
00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:51.293
<v Speaker 2>And also you get to practice doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that's hypothetically an </v>

120
00:06:54.171 --> 00:06:57.360
<v Speaker 2>improvement on something that's actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>your own.</v>

121
00:06:57.361 --> 00:06:59.340
<v Speaker 2>You're not putting anyone else at any </v>
<v Speaker 2>risk.</v>

122
00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:00.863
<v Speaker 2>And the benefits of that are also are </v>
<v Speaker 2>also quite remarkable because then you </v>

123
00:07:05.041 --> 00:07:05.874
<v Speaker 2>have a space around you that's beautiful</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you get to benefit from whatever it </v>

124
00:07:08.971 --> 00:07:09.804
<v Speaker 2>is that beauty is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beauty is deep and people are afraid of </v>

125
00:07:13.231 --> 00:07:14.064
<v Speaker 2>it too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is another thing that makes it </v>

126
00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:20.490
<v Speaker 2>difficult and challenging is I believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>the favorite color that Canadians have.</v>

127
00:07:20.491 --> 00:07:25.470
<v Speaker 2>Canadians for decorator purposes is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>beige and you know,</v>

128
00:07:25.471 --> 00:07:26.304
<v Speaker 2>there's a reason for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason is you can't go wrong </v>

129
00:07:28.831 --> 00:07:29.664
<v Speaker 2>with beige,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the problem with that is you can go </v>

130
00:07:32.201 --> 00:07:33.034
<v Speaker 2>right with it either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so trying to make something </v>

131
00:07:35.981 --> 00:07:36.814
<v Speaker 2>beautiful demands that you step out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ordinary and that's frightening and </v>

132
00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.170
<v Speaker 2>it's really useful to try to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

133
00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:47.040
<v Speaker 1>I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been to your home,</v>

134
00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:52.310
<v Speaker 1>it will not be a secret to those who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

135
00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:55.720
<v Speaker 1>familiar with you and the frequency with</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you have been on,</v>

136
00:07:56.190 --> 00:08:00.120
<v Speaker 1>on the agenda and big ideas that we know</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other quite well.</v>

137
00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:01.353
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell me which of your rooms in your </v>

138
00:08:04.621 --> 00:08:05.454
<v Speaker 1>house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you deem to be the most beautiful </v>

139
00:08:06.751 --> 00:08:07.584
<v Speaker 1>one?</v>

140
00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:08.890
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a front room.</v>

141
00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:10.310
<v Speaker 2>It's a small room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

142
00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.420
<v Speaker 2>because I live in a quite a small place </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I lived downtown,</v>

143
00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:17.560
<v Speaker 2>I have a front room which is a living </v>
<v Speaker 2>room I suppose.</v>

144
00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:18.740
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it,</v>

145
00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:23.320
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about 12 by 12 and it's,</v>

146
00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:27.520
<v Speaker 2>it has a beautiful fireplace and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>marble tiled and the cover,</v>

147
00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:30.590
<v Speaker 2>it's a gas fireplace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The cover is a cover that,</v>

148
00:08:30.591 --> 00:08:32.840
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was part of the original house before we</v>

149
00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:38.440
<v Speaker 2>redid it and it's made out of like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bronze tinted cast iron.</v>

150
00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:45.610
<v Speaker 2>And then in that room there are probably</v>
<v Speaker 2>15 paintings of different sizes.</v>

151
00:08:48.561 --> 00:08:50.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm ranging from like monumental,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could,</v>

152
00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:55.960
<v Speaker 2>one of them's about seven by nine and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then there's several others in there,</v>

153
00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:59.910
<v Speaker 2>believe it or not often or approximately</v>
<v Speaker 2>that size.</v>

154
00:08:59.911 --> 00:09:00.744
<v Speaker 2>And there's this sculpture and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and some paintings by a famous Mexican </v>

155
00:09:05.401 --> 00:09:06.234
<v Speaker 2>artists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

156
00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:07.860
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might think,</v>

157
00:09:07.861 --> 00:09:08.694
<v Speaker 2>well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's would be prohibitively expensive </v>

158
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:12.630
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

159
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:14.183
<v Speaker 2>for someone to attempt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's actually not because you can </v>

160
00:09:15.811 --> 00:09:19.290
<v Speaker 2>buy paintings at a very reasonable price</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you learn how to find them.</v>

161
00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:21.600
<v Speaker 2>I find most of them on Ebay as it turns </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

162
00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.150
<v Speaker 2>And I'd found some unbelievable </v>
<v Speaker 2>paintings on Ebay.</v>

163
00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:26.910
<v Speaker 2>I've had to look a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably looked at,</v>

164
00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:28.573
<v Speaker 2>I tried to calculate it the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've looked at two or 300 paintings a </v>

165
00:09:33.061 --> 00:09:36.740
<v Speaker 2>day for 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's about $6,000</v>

166
00:09:36.741 --> 00:09:41.610
<v Speaker 2>a months or about 75 to $100,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>a year.</v>

167
00:09:41.611 --> 00:09:45.330
<v Speaker 2>So that's a million paintings in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in 10 years.</v>

168
00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:48.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm curious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how long does it take you to know,</v>

169
00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:51.070
<v Speaker 1>to know where the painting is worthy of </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest?</v>

170
00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:55.470
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could take as little as,</v>

171
00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:58.893
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

172
00:09:59.140 --> 00:09:59.973
<v Speaker 2>it's less than half a second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably more like a fifth of a </v>

173
00:10:06.011 --> 00:10:07.420
<v Speaker 2>second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably.</v>

174
00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:12.290
<v Speaker 2>Most of them are so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just absolutely unbelievable and,</v>

175
00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:14.260
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

176
00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:17.150
<v Speaker 2>the ones that aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they kind of pop out and,</v>

177
00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:18.633
<v Speaker 2>and then I put them in a group a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I opened a new tab and look and save it </v>

178
00:10:23.591 --> 00:10:26.170
<v Speaker 2>for later consideration and make a </v>
<v Speaker 2>small,</v>

179
00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:26.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

180
00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:29.110
<v Speaker 2>I call,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told them very,</v>

181
00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:32.500
<v Speaker 2>very radically and so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean it's really been very,</v>

182
00:10:32.501 --> 00:10:35.320
<v Speaker 2>it's been very interesting to try to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>this not only to the,</v>

183
00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:37.090
<v Speaker 2>to the room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to the whole house.</v>

184
00:10:37.091 --> 00:10:37.924
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I mean I have 36 colors in my house </v>

185
00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:43.120
<v Speaker 2>and I had a friend of mine who's from </v>
<v Speaker 2>Montreal,</v>

186
00:10:43.121 --> 00:10:45.910
<v Speaker 2>helped me initially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a portrait painter and he helped me</v>

187
00:10:45.911 --> 00:10:50.800
<v Speaker 2>initially pick the colors and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the questions is,</v>

188
00:10:50.801 --> 00:10:51.634
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does that do when you do something </v>

189
00:10:52.571 --> 00:10:53.080
<v Speaker 2>like that?</v>

190
00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:53.913
<v Speaker 2>And I mean one of the things that's been</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite interesting is it always gives me </v>

191
00:10:56.801 --> 00:10:57.634
<v Speaker 2>an excuse to invite interesting people </v>
<v Speaker 2>over to my house because I have </v>

192
00:11:00.731 --> 00:11:05.290
<v Speaker 2>something interesting to show them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's made it easier for me too.</v>

193
00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:06.813
<v Speaker 2>It's been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's made it easier for me to make </v>

194
00:11:08.051 --> 00:11:10.570
<v Speaker 2>certain kinds of social arrangements </v>
<v Speaker 2>with people.</v>

195
00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:11.913
<v Speaker 2>I'm also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is something I thought about a </v>

196
00:11:13.751 --> 00:11:17.080
<v Speaker 2>lot when I had my kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're often university now,</v>

197
00:11:17.081 --> 00:11:19.270
<v Speaker 2>but when they were little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

198
00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:24.130
<v Speaker 2>it struck me that it would be useful to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have them surrounded by</v>

199
00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:28.820
<v Speaker 2>productions of high quality because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

200
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:29.863
<v Speaker 2>they tell you about production of high </v>
<v Speaker 2>quality and artistic production tells </v>

201
00:11:32.901 --> 00:11:36.260
<v Speaker 2>you something like a painting for </v>
<v Speaker 2>example of something.</v>

202
00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:39.260
<v Speaker 2>Most of the paintings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a relatively representational,</v>

203
00:11:39.261 --> 00:11:42.890
<v Speaker 2>although not all of them because there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>lots of different dimensions of beauty,</v>

204
00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.280
<v Speaker 2>but a representational painting that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful,</v>

205
00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:49.970
<v Speaker 2>have something normal because some of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the paintings that I have are of working</v>

206
00:11:49.971 --> 00:11:51.110
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

207
00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:56.530
<v Speaker 2>what the patient tells you is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although you don't notice it because you</v>

208
00:11:56.531 --> 00:11:57.364
<v Speaker 2>don't have the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're surrounded by things that are </v>

209
00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:03.820
<v Speaker 2>worthy of great attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And here's an example.</v>

210
00:12:03.821 --> 00:12:08.821
<v Speaker 2>Here's a portrait of a working man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe a coal miner that some artists who</v>

211
00:12:09.011 --> 00:12:13.990
<v Speaker 2>is talented spent 250 hours on just </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting the face right.</v>

212
00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:15.123
<v Speaker 2>And so what that reminds you of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though you don't know it when you </v>

213
00:12:17.201 --> 00:12:20.260
<v Speaker 2>look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that everything that you glance at is</v>

214
00:12:20.261 --> 00:12:22.420
<v Speaker 2>worth 250 hours of study.</v>

215
00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:26.530
<v Speaker 2>It's just you don't have the time and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you forget about it because you have to,</v>

216
00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:30.460
<v Speaker 2>but the world is full of things that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely remarkable,</v>

217
00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:33.880
<v Speaker 2>deeply remarkable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what an artist does is tell you that</v>

218
00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:36.850
<v Speaker 2>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when you have those things around</v>

219
00:12:36.851 --> 00:12:38.500
<v Speaker 2>you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have beautiful things around you.</v>

220
00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:43.950
<v Speaker 2>It's a constant reminder that behind the</v>
<v Speaker 2>necessary shallowness of your perception</v>

221
00:12:44.561 --> 00:12:45.394
<v Speaker 2>is the kind of depth that you need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make contact with in order to sustain </v>

222
00:12:48.281 --> 00:12:52.750
<v Speaker 2>your faith in life and in humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a trivial thing.</v>

223
00:12:52.751 --> 00:12:55.840
<v Speaker 2>It's a really important thing and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can see this.</v>

224
00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:56.823
<v Speaker 2>Just one more comment on this like </v>
<v Speaker 2>although it's harder for conservative </v>

225
00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:04.120
<v Speaker 2>people to appreciate this because by </v>
<v Speaker 2>temperament they're not as aesthetically</v>

226
00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:08.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm committed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say are interested.</v>

227
00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:09.623
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things we should remember is </v>

228
00:13:10.661 --> 00:13:15.550
<v Speaker 2>that Europe has become a magnet for </v>
<v Speaker 2>tourists all over the world and it draws</v>

229
00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:16.533
<v Speaker 2>billions and billions of dollars a year </v>
<v Speaker 2>of revenue from other countries because </v>

230
00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:23.470
<v Speaker 2>people come from all over to look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>impractical,</v>

231
00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:25.810
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beautiful things.</v>

232
00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:27.083
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it turns out they're not practical at </v>

233
00:13:27.971 --> 00:13:30.670
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're so practical that you just.</v>

234
00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:34.840
<v Speaker 2>The fact that they're beautiful is </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably an indication that they're more</v>

235
00:13:34.841 --> 00:13:35.674
<v Speaker 2>practical than anything else you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibly imagine because your </v>

236
00:13:38.501 --> 00:13:39.334
<v Speaker 2>appreciation for beauty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beauty I think is probably it's a </v>

237
00:13:42.941 --> 00:13:47.941
<v Speaker 2>facility that you have of noting what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>valuable beyond the mundane.</v>

238
00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:53.050
<v Speaker 1>So John,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's move on.</v>

239
00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:58.140
<v Speaker 1>Let's continue with talking about things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are to be appreciated and will.</v>

240
00:13:58.331 --> 00:14:01.660
<v Speaker 1>Number 37 is pat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>

241
00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:04.750
<v Speaker 1>pat kept when you encountered one on </v>
<v Speaker 1>this treat,</v>

242
00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:07.740
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is that an essential</v>

243
00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:09.310
<v Speaker 2>important part of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

244
00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:09.911
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

245
00:14:09.911 --> 00:14:11.980
<v Speaker 2>of a good life?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

246
00:14:11.981 --> 00:14:12.814
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

247
00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:13.863
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

248
00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:16.893
<v Speaker 2>I suppose it's in the same category and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess this is rather evident of stop </v>

249
00:14:20.501 --> 00:14:21.334
<v Speaker 2>and smell the roses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although obviously that's degenerated </v>

250
00:14:24.641 --> 00:14:25.474
<v Speaker 2>into something of a cliche,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean it's easy to become so </v>

251
00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:32.253
<v Speaker 2>obsessed with your particular goal that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't notice what's around you when </v>

252
00:14:38.891 --> 00:14:39.724
<v Speaker 2>it's happening and a catcher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a good break from that as far as I'm </v>

253
00:14:43.511 --> 00:14:46.390
<v Speaker 2>concerned because they'll poke their </v>
<v Speaker 2>little heads out and kind of take a look</v>

254
00:14:46.391 --> 00:14:47.224
<v Speaker 2>at you because they're interested in </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe having a momentary pleasurable </v>

255
00:14:49.991 --> 00:14:54.991
<v Speaker 2>interaction and there seems to be very </v>
<v Speaker 2>little harm in doing it and it takes you</v>

256
00:14:56.241 --> 00:14:58.760
<v Speaker 2>out of your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It takes you out of one timeframe,</v>

257
00:14:58.790 --> 00:14:59.623
<v Speaker 2>which is often a goal oriented and </v>
<v Speaker 2>practical timeframe which are obviously </v>

258
00:15:03.501 --> 00:15:04.334
<v Speaker 2>necessary timeframes and helps you </v>
<v Speaker 2>concentrate on the moment and attending </v>

259
00:15:09.441 --> 00:15:10.310
<v Speaker 2>to the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

260
00:15:10.311 --> 00:15:11.900
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's analogous to the same thing.</v>

261
00:15:11.901 --> 00:15:15.200
<v Speaker 2>We just discussed with regards to </v>
<v Speaker 2>surrounding yourself with beauty,</v>

262
00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:17.053
<v Speaker 2>it's hard for people to pay enough </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention to the moment and when an </v>

263
00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:22.243
<v Speaker 2>opportunity presents itself to you where</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could immerse yourself in something </v>

264
00:15:26.451 --> 00:15:31.451
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's of high quality for no cost.</v>

265
00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:33.170
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>

266
00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:36.370
<v Speaker 2>there's no downside to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So well,</v>

267
00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:37.243
<v Speaker 2>a good rule of thumb is like engage in </v>
<v Speaker 2>every opportunity you possibly have for </v>

268
00:15:40.311 --> 00:15:41.144
<v Speaker 2>peaceful pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's that as is of no cost to anyone </v>

269
00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:46.753
<v Speaker 2>and there's lots of opportunities like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that around and people start noticing </v>

270
00:15:50.391 --> 00:15:51.224
<v Speaker 2>them like we're wired out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we stopped noticing things that are </v>

271
00:15:53.541 --> 00:15:57.200
<v Speaker 2>working and there's a reason for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's practical,</v>

272
00:15:57.201 --> 00:15:59.450
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that you forget about everything that</v>

273
00:15:59.451 --> 00:16:02.600
<v Speaker 2>surrounds you that's working really well</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that and that is pleasurable.</v>

274
00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:06.290
<v Speaker 1>Can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you give me some other examples of a</v>

275
00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:10.000
<v Speaker 1>pleasurable activities that have that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

276
00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:13.190
<v Speaker 1>that quality that they take you out of?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

277
00:16:13.191 --> 00:16:15.430
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ordinary humdrum,</v>

278
00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:15.921
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

279
00:16:15.921 --> 00:16:18.260
<v Speaker 1>the purposeful pursuit of things.</v>

280
00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:19.021
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

281
00:16:19.021 --> 00:16:20.970
<v Speaker 2>I think hot showers are good example of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

282
00:16:20.971 --> 00:16:22.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about a hot shower.</v>

283
00:16:22.561 --> 00:16:23.394
<v Speaker 2>It's like almost everyone in North </v>
<v Speaker 2>America is so rich that they have a </v>

284
00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:31.950
<v Speaker 2>personal hot spring in their house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

285
00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:34.650
<v Speaker 2>that's a good deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's such a good deal.</v>

286
00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:35.573
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so impossible and so unlikely and </v>

287
00:16:38.191 --> 00:16:39.790
<v Speaker 2>people take it for granted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although,</v>

288
00:16:39.791 --> 00:16:40.624
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes and no because they sing in the </v>

289
00:16:41.761 --> 00:16:42.594
<v Speaker 2>shower and lots of people say they have </v>
<v Speaker 2>their best ideas in the shower and it's </v>

290
00:16:44.791 --> 00:16:45.624
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really useful to remember when </v>

291
00:16:47.011 --> 00:16:47.844
<v Speaker 2>you're in the shower that hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't you king of the universe with </v>

292
00:16:50.791 --> 00:16:55.080
<v Speaker 2>your hot spring inside your house and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what a great deal that is.</v>

293
00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:59.240
<v Speaker 2>And lots of things are like that and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>forget about them and it's,</v>

294
00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:00.093
<v Speaker 2>it's the curse of human beings to forget</v>
<v Speaker 2>about things because we're kind of </v>

295
00:17:02.911 --> 00:17:06.810
<v Speaker 2>cognitively limited and we're always </v>
<v Speaker 2>attending to problems and so you have to</v>

296
00:17:06.811 --> 00:17:08.790
<v Speaker 2>sort of stop yourself now and then and </v>
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

297
00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:10.163
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

298
00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:12.240
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it great that this works?</v>

299
00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:16.410
<v Speaker 2>I also think the same thing about cars </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I,</v>

300
00:17:16.411 --> 00:17:19.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm firmly convinced that if the </v>
<v Speaker 2>automobile was invented today,</v>

301
00:17:19.501 --> 00:17:22.230
<v Speaker 2>there's no bloody way it would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>illegal for people to drive.</v>

302
00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:23.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we left,</v>

303
00:17:24.090 --> 00:17:27.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the risk of being sexist in ages,</v>

304
00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:30.000
<v Speaker 2>we let little old ladies pilot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

305
00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:31.013
<v Speaker 2>3,500</v>
<v Speaker 2>pounds of hurdling metal down barrier </v>

306
00:17:34.231 --> 00:17:35.064
<v Speaker 2>lined highways with thousands and </v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of other people around that </v>

307
00:17:38.551 --> 00:17:43.551
<v Speaker 2>could be run over and no one even </v>
<v Speaker 2>notices that that's an absolute miracle,</v>

308
00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:45.461
<v Speaker 2>that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

309
00:17:45.461 --> 00:17:46.294
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can do that and that it's not </v>

310
00:17:48.091 --> 00:17:49.440
<v Speaker 2>illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

311
00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:50.573
<v Speaker 2>every time I think that it just makes my</v>
<v Speaker 2>jaw drop because it violates every </v>

312
00:17:53.791 --> 00:17:56.280
<v Speaker 2>principle of common sense you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibly imagine.</v>

313
00:17:56.281 --> 00:18:00.750
<v Speaker 2>And plus it's so much fun and cars </v>
<v Speaker 2>worked so well.</v>

314
00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:02.820
<v Speaker 2>They're so good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I have an old car,</v>

315
00:18:02.821 --> 00:18:05.970
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a Hyundai Sonata from 19,</v>

316
00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:09.340
<v Speaker 2>from 2004,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

317
00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:12.840
<v Speaker 2>so it's getting to be an old car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The bloody thing is perfect,</v>

318
00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:13.823
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's got a top speed of about 140 miles </v>

319
00:18:15.481 --> 00:18:16.314
<v Speaker 2>an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's smooth as silk has a great sound </v>

320
00:18:18.331 --> 00:18:23.331
<v Speaker 2>system and I can zoom around like a mad </v>
<v Speaker 2>dog and the authorities are,</v>

321
00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:25.380
<v Speaker 2>don't bother themselves with that.</v>

322
00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:28.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go on the record here and,</v>

323
00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:33.330
<v Speaker 1>and much support you in admiration of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that we have achieved as a,</v>

324
00:18:34.201 --> 00:18:37.470
<v Speaker 1>as a conscious realization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

325
00:18:37.471 --> 00:18:42.471
<v Speaker 1>something on parallel which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to allow individuals to,</v>

326
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:43.833
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drive potentially killing machines in a </v>

327
00:18:47.641 --> 00:18:49.470
<v Speaker 1>way in which in which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

328
00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:52.050
<v Speaker 1>the killing does not happen for the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>part,</v>

329
00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:57.060
<v Speaker 1>does not happen and it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not intentional and that it somehow</v>

330
00:18:58.171 --> 00:18:59.004
<v Speaker 1>it does embody and amazing or that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact of driving a mass suggests that we </v>

331
00:19:06.151 --> 00:19:06.984
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will be able to create a cartoon in </v>

332
00:19:09.001 --> 00:19:09.661
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

333
00:19:09.661 --> 00:19:14.661
<v Speaker 1>the principles of freedom and older able</v>
<v Speaker 1>to exist in an amazing fashion.</v>

334
00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:16.740
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing.</v>

335
00:19:16.741 --> 00:19:18.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

336
00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:18.873
<v Speaker 2>that if we invented a new technology </v>
<v Speaker 2>that killed as many people a year is </v>

337
00:19:21.541 --> 00:19:22.890
<v Speaker 2>audible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>

338
00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:25.740
<v Speaker 2>there's no way we disseminated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There isn't a chance,</v>

339
00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:26.933
<v Speaker 2>but for some reason automobiles have </v>
<v Speaker 2>have sneaked through that and it even </v>

340
00:19:31.111 --> 00:19:31.944
<v Speaker 2>more amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They sneak through that so well that </v>

341
00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:37.230
<v Speaker 2>even totalitarian states can't stop </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

342
00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:41.100
<v Speaker 2>And so the first thing your basic </v>
<v Speaker 2>dictator does is buy a Mercedes.</v>

343
00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:42.113
<v Speaker 2>It's like he's screwed right off the bat</v>
<v Speaker 2>as soon as he buys the Mercedes because </v>

344
00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:50.480
<v Speaker 2>what he's announcing is that personal </v>
<v Speaker 2>mobility trumps everything and it's</v>

345
00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:58.670
<v Speaker 1>only country in which the leadership has</v>
<v Speaker 1>managed to maintain a,</v>

346
00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:05.150
<v Speaker 1>a control over who's allowed to drive or</v>
<v Speaker 1>not North Korea,</v>

347
00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:07.463
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Arabia bit too because they're not so </v>

348
00:20:08.781 --> 00:20:09.614
<v Speaker 2>thrilled about having their women drive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a sad commentary on Saudi </v>

349
00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:14.140
<v Speaker 2>Arabia.</v>

350
00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:17.010
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let us move on and,</v>

351
00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:21.090
<v Speaker 1>and I want to raise another rule that </v>
<v Speaker 1>really surprised me.</v>

352
00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:26.270
<v Speaker 1>Rule number 37,</v>
<v Speaker 1>38 a do not bother children when they're</v>

353
00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:28.313
<v Speaker 1>skateboarding.</v>

354
00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:34.270
<v Speaker 2>It's always been a source of amazement </v>
<v Speaker 2>to me.</v>

355
00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:38.020
<v Speaker 2>The way that institutions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>businesses,</v>

356
00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:40.890
<v Speaker 2>governments treat skateboarders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

357
00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:41.763
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you ever sit and watch a group of </v>

358
00:20:43.151 --> 00:20:45.010
<v Speaker 2>adolescent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're usually boys,</v>

359
00:20:45.011 --> 00:20:46.900
<v Speaker 2>not always skateboard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

360
00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:51.730
<v Speaker 2>you can't help but be struck with </v>
<v Speaker 2>amazement about how brave they are.</v>

361
00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:55.870
<v Speaker 2>Like outside of the St George Building </v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

362
00:20:56.350 --> 00:21:01.350
<v Speaker 2>the kids will jump up on the metal </v>
<v Speaker 2>railing that goes down on the steps,</v>

363
00:21:01.511 --> 00:21:02.344
<v Speaker 2>on the cement steps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll jump up on that with your </v>

364
00:21:03.791 --> 00:21:06.970
<v Speaker 2>skateboard and try to write it down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like they fall off,</v>

365
00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:11.500
<v Speaker 2>they fall off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right onto the cement and with the sharp</v>

366
00:21:11.501 --> 00:21:13.300
<v Speaker 2>edges and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they all,</v>

367
00:21:13.301 --> 00:21:14.134
<v Speaker 2>their friends laugh and they lay there </v>
<v Speaker 2>and lose their breath and they gasp and </v>

368
00:21:17.141 --> 00:21:18.100
<v Speaker 2>Moan and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

369
00:21:18.101 --> 00:21:19.930
<v Speaker 2>two minutes later they're up throwing it</v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

370
00:21:19.931 --> 00:21:23.530
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so brave and they're so good at it.</v>

371
00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:26.140
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's harmless.</v>

372
00:21:26.141 --> 00:21:27.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they might get hurt,</v>

373
00:21:27.161 --> 00:21:29.010
<v Speaker 2>but that's hardly the point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

374
00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:33.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't be encased in Styrofoam.</v>

375
00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:33.843
<v Speaker 2>It's a pathetic way live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And those kids are brave and they're </v>

376
00:21:36.101 --> 00:21:41.101
<v Speaker 2>trying to master something really </v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult and all they get is grief.</v>

377
00:21:41.231 --> 00:21:44.010
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>outside my,</v>

378
00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:46.000
<v Speaker 2>the building I work in here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are some,</v>

379
00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:46.923
<v Speaker 2>some cement containers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're quite long and they lined the </v>

380
00:21:51.671 --> 00:21:54.020
<v Speaker 2>street,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are trees in them and uh,</v>

381
00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:56.300
<v Speaker 2>the skateboarders like to jump up on </v>
<v Speaker 2>them and,</v>

382
00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:59.440
<v Speaker 2>and of zip along the edge with their </v>
<v Speaker 2>skateboard.</v>

383
00:21:59.441 --> 00:22:00.274
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the university has done about that </v>

384
00:22:02.261 --> 00:22:04.490
<v Speaker 2>is put all these metal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

385
00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:08.350
<v Speaker 2>they're a little metal strips along the </v>
<v Speaker 2>edge of the containers.</v>

386
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:09.303
<v Speaker 2>So the skateboarders can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it just irritates me because first </v>

387
00:22:12.641 --> 00:22:14.620
<v Speaker 2>of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the metal strips or as ugly as sin,</v>

388
00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:18.460
<v Speaker 2>they looked like they were put up by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by a totalitarian state.</v>

389
00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:19.660
<v Speaker 2>And second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

390
00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:22.840
<v Speaker 2>leave the damn kids alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let them play.</v>

391
00:22:22.841 --> 00:22:26.170
<v Speaker 2>That's what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're playing and kids need to play.</v>

392
00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:30.250
<v Speaker 2>So and that skateboarders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not let them skate board.</v>

393
00:22:30.251 --> 00:22:31.084
<v Speaker 2>They're not drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not like they're not doing </v>

394
00:22:33.731 --> 00:22:37.270
<v Speaker 2>anything delinquent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're out there trying to master their</v>

395
00:22:37.271 --> 00:22:39.010
<v Speaker 2>bodies and to be brave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

396
00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:39.933
<v Speaker 2>and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that irritates people who won't </v>

397
00:22:42.311 --> 00:22:43.144
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They look at those kids and there's the </v>

398
00:22:45.181 --> 00:22:47.550
<v Speaker 2>part of them that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not right.</v>

399
00:22:47.551 --> 00:22:48.101
<v Speaker 2>Things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

400
00:22:48.101 --> 00:22:49.350
<v Speaker 2>those little rats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

401
00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:50.980
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not a little wrapped.</v>

402
00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:54.690
<v Speaker 2>They're brave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what they're doing is remarkable.</v>

403
00:22:54.691 --> 00:22:55.524
<v Speaker 2>It's like gymnastics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>except they're not on a nice rubber </v>

404
00:22:58.561 --> 00:23:00.150
<v Speaker 2>floor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're on cement.</v>

405
00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:01.260
<v Speaker 2>They're brave.</v>

406
00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:06.060
<v Speaker 1>What is the principle that the defendant</v>
<v Speaker 1>here as there,</v>

407
00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:09.130
<v Speaker 1>is it important to have a correlation of</v>
<v Speaker 1>bravery,</v>

408
00:23:09.131 --> 00:23:11.620
<v Speaker 1>of physical bravery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or is that it?</v>

409
00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:12.573
<v Speaker 1>The importance of understanding and </v>
<v Speaker 1>accepting that that good good life </v>

410
00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:20.260
<v Speaker 1>involves a certain degree of risk.</v>

411
00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:22.773
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the good life also requires</v>
<v Speaker 2>a certain amount of ability to admire </v>

412
00:23:27.591 --> 00:23:32.591
<v Speaker 2>those people who take risks and plus </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not doing any harm.</v>

413
00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:34.431
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

414
00:23:34.431 --> 00:23:36.020
<v Speaker 2>someone might object,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

415
00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:38.120
<v Speaker 2>what about liability?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But my,</v>

416
00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:41.280
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my experience with liability is,</v>

417
00:23:41.281 --> 00:23:45.080
<v Speaker 2>is that as soon as someone talks about </v>
<v Speaker 2>liability,</v>

418
00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:46.603
<v Speaker 2>you better be skeptical of their motives</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're using their liability </v>

419
00:23:49.821 --> 00:23:50.654
<v Speaker 2>argument to abdicate their </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility for participating in the </v>

420
00:23:54.411 --> 00:23:59.180
<v Speaker 2>necessary dangers of a civilized state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole liability thing that's a,</v>

421
00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:02.000
<v Speaker 2>that's a weasel his way out as far as </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm concerned.</v>

422
00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:03.533
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

423
00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:07.800
<v Speaker 1>is this the reason why you have the main</v>
<v Speaker 1>point of this,</v>

424
00:24:07.801 --> 00:24:09.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

425
00:24:09.151 --> 00:24:12.280
<v Speaker 1>and formulated to the rule of the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have is,</v>

426
00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:15.030
<v Speaker 1>is it because you have a sense that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

427
00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:16.223
<v Speaker 1>that we increasingly subject to a kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the cautionary principle that the </v>

428
00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:24.470
<v Speaker 1>seminar society is preoccupied with too </v>
<v Speaker 1>much risk and,</v>

429
00:24:24.471 --> 00:24:25.320
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>

430
00:24:25.321 --> 00:24:28.890
<v Speaker 1>and the counselors asked to be in ways </v>
<v Speaker 1>which are,</v>

431
00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:30.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not too risky.</v>

432
00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:32.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's part of it.</v>

433
00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:33.713
<v Speaker 2>I also think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the other part of the two is </v>

434
00:24:35.281 --> 00:24:36.410
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

435
00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:39.240
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of the time these skateboarders are</v>

436
00:24:39.241 --> 00:24:40.074
<v Speaker 2>boys and they're like adolescent boys </v>
<v Speaker 2>state and I think that admiration for </v>

437
00:24:44.431 --> 00:24:46.620
<v Speaker 2>the sorts of things they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a kind of,</v>

438
00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:48.780
<v Speaker 2>in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's reckless,</v>

439
00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:49.793
<v Speaker 2>reckless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>masculine courage that's sorely lacking </v>

440
00:24:52.021 --> 00:24:53.850
<v Speaker 2>in our society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

441
00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:56.430
<v Speaker 2>people might object at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's my opinion.</v>

442
00:24:56.431 --> 00:24:57.264
<v Speaker 2>But I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talk about this a fair bit in my </v>

443
00:24:58.621 --> 00:25:00.870
<v Speaker 2>classes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like my class this week.</v>

444
00:25:00.871 --> 00:25:05.490
<v Speaker 2>I showed the students a couple of clips </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the lion king when Simba,</v>

445
00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:09.480
<v Speaker 2>the lion king is growing up and trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to become braids.</v>

446
00:25:09.481 --> 00:25:11.130
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

447
00:25:11.131 --> 00:25:14.190
<v Speaker 2>I have my students,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the boys in particular,</v>

448
00:25:14.191 --> 00:25:16.860
<v Speaker 2>the young men coming up to me constantly</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying that,</v>

449
00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:17.723
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

450
00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:18.753
<v Speaker 2>they just see no appreciation whatsoever</v>
<v Speaker 2>for what used to be termed masculine </v>

451
00:25:22.591 --> 00:25:24.210
<v Speaker 2>virtues anywhere in society.</v>

452
00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:26.910
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

453
00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:28.850
<v Speaker 2>it's not good for the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

454
00:25:28.851 --> 00:25:32.490
<v Speaker 2>that one of them wrote me a letter this </v>
<v Speaker 2>week stating exactly that,</v>

455
00:25:32.491 --> 00:25:34.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're hurt by it and,</v>

456
00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:35.993
<v Speaker 2>and there's a resentment towards it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I see it really expressed in that </v>

457
00:25:39.570 --> 00:25:41.370
<v Speaker 2>attitude towards skateboard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this like,</v>

458
00:25:41.371 --> 00:25:43.600
<v Speaker 2>what's wrong with those kids are fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're plus.</v>

459
00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:47.220
<v Speaker 2>Plus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other thing I know is that play kids</v>

460
00:25:47.221 --> 00:25:51.910
<v Speaker 2>have to play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not playing isn't what,</v>

461
00:25:51.970 --> 00:25:54.960
<v Speaker 2>what do you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not of secondary importance.</v>

462
00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:58.040
<v Speaker 2>Human beings have a place circuit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

463
00:25:58.041 --> 00:25:58.874
<v Speaker 2>it's part of being a mammal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the ways that human beings </v>

464
00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:07.160
<v Speaker 2>organize themselves at the highest level</v>
<v Speaker 2>of moral virtue is through play.</v>

465
00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:09.680
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when those kids,</v>

466
00:26:09.681 --> 00:26:11.900
<v Speaker 2>the kids that are skateboarding in their</v>
<v Speaker 2>groups,</v>

467
00:26:11.901 --> 00:26:12.734
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're evaluating each other for </v>

468
00:26:13.551 --> 00:26:14.384
<v Speaker 2>courage and bravery and they're watching</v>
<v Speaker 2>each other perform difficult physical </v>

469
00:26:18.051 --> 00:26:18.884
<v Speaker 2>app.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're extending their limits and </v>

470
00:26:20.571 --> 00:26:24.380
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should be happy about that.</v>

471
00:26:24.381 --> 00:26:26.810
<v Speaker 2>And if you just sit down and watch them </v>
<v Speaker 2>for 10 minutes,</v>

472
00:26:26.811 --> 00:26:28.780
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like warranty.</v>

473
00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:30.890
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like watching gymnastics.</v>

474
00:26:30.891 --> 00:26:34.730
<v Speaker 2>It's goal as far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>goes skateboarders.</v>

475
00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:36.360
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>first time out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope to be able to talk to you again.</v>

478
00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:49.290
<v Speaker 1>We have only managed to talk about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>three other rules.</v>

479
00:26:49.291 --> 00:26:54.150

<v Speaker 1>so we've got 39 to go.</v>
